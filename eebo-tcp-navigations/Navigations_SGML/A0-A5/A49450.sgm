<HEAD>J. LUDOLPHUS TO THE Courteous Reader.</HEAD>
<P>AT length I pre&s;ent you with my <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Hi&s;torie, long-promis'd, long expected by my friends. Nor will this delay be wonder'd at by tho&s;e that con&s;ider how I am ty'd to public duty and employment, utterly di&s;&s;onant from the&s;e &s;ort of Studies. Be&s;ide which, there were many other Rea&s;ons. For I had collected indeed the Body of the matter from the Writings and Di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Gregory</HI> the <HI>Habe&s;&s;inian,</HI> but the Circum&s;tances of time and place, and the names of per&s;ons were yet wanting. So that there was Timber and Bricks for the Building, but only Lime and Cement was wanting. Moreover after &s;o many Fables had been Printed upon this &s;ubject, I thought it would not be &s;o pru|dently done to utter more novelty upon the credit of one &s;ingle per&s;on; le&s;t a new truth might be lookt upon as a new Tale. At length having got into my hands <HI>Balthazer Tellez,</HI> from whom as well to &s;upply what I wanted, as al&s;o to confirm what might &s;eem to be doubtfull, yet then likewi&s;e I wanted Lei&s;ure. Which when the mo&s;t Serene <HI>Saxo-Gotan</HI> Dukes had indulg'd me, I Tran&s;lated my family to <HI>Frankfort</HI> upon the <HI>Main,</HI> to the end that I might have the benefit of &s;everal famous Libraries in that Noble City, and the opportunity of a Learned Con|ver&s;ation, and by that means accompli&s;h my intended work, which by Gods A&s;&s;i&s;tance I did in &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>After this, when all was ready for the Pre&s;s, there &s;till wanted what was nece&s;&s;ary to forward the Publi&s;hing of this work. A proper <HI>Ama|nuen&s;is</HI> to tran&s;cribe the whole matter, and to attend upon the Cor|rection of the Impre&s;&s;ion; which my occa&s;ions would not permit me to do; and then in the next place &s;uch Forraign Characters as this work requir'd, which Impediments were al&s;o at la&s;t remov'd. For there was a certain Young Gentleman recommended to me, eminent for his Lear|ning and integritie, by name <HI>John Henry, Majus,</HI> a Student in Theology, and the Oriental Tongues. Who being well skill'd in the Hebrew Lan|guage, and the Dialect of the Rabbins, by my help ea&s;ily made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Ethiopic,</HI> and &s;o fitted him&s;elf for the imployment I de&s;ign'd Him. He therefore by my directions made the heads of the Chapters, the Sections, the Index, and Tran&s;lated the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> into Latin, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the work and put it forward, taking upon him the whole Correction of it: For which rea&s;on I can recommend his de&s;erts the more ju&s;tly to all good and learned Men.</P>
<P>The Printing part was undertaken by <HI>Baltha&s;ar Chri&s;topher Wu&s;tius,</HI> as well for that he was well known among Forainers, as becau&s;e he had a Printing Hou&s;e furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of Letters for Foraign Langua|ges. He al&s;o cau&s;ed the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> and <HI>Amharic</HI> Characters to be engrav'd in Copper by the famous <HI>John Adolphus Schmide,</HI> and afterwards to be ca&s;t for farther u&s;e. But the&s;e could not be brought to perfection, &s;o &s;oon
<PB REF="3">
as the Compo&s;iters requir'd, and therefore there was a nece&s;&s;itie of mixing &s;ome old and le&s;s elegant, with the new and neater Characters.</P>
<P>As to the Work it &s;elf, I have &s;aid enough in the Proem: No man under&s;tandeth the warts and defects better than my &s;elf. Therfore I re&s;olv'd to deferr the Publi&s;hing till newer and fuller relations return'd out of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> or that I might receive them from the bordering Regi|ons, as being furni&s;hed for that purpo&s;e with very great and mo&s;t gene|rous Recommendations, till I had brought my de&s;ign to a full and elaborate perfection. But many Illu&s;trious men, and my mo&s;t honour'd friends, interceded with me, telling me, <HI>That never any thing came forth perfect at fir&s;t in all its parts: And that therefore this Hi&s;tory was no longer to be conceal'd from the Chri&s;tian and Learned World, which it concerned to know the&s;e things: For that if any thing &s;hould fall out hereafter worthy of remark, it might be put into an Appendix, or added to a new Edition.</HI> Which makes me hope for pardon from the more Candid Reader, if his de&s;ire or expectation be not &s;atisfied in all particulars. For I relate not altoge|ther things beheld with my own eyes, but what I have either read my &s;elf or heard from others, yet congruous to Truth and well cohering between them&s;elves. If I have not reach'd the &s;ence of my Authors, I will amend upon admonition; or el&s;e return my thanks and &s;atisfaction to the admoni&s;her. That I &s;hould plea&s;e all men, a thing which never mor|tal yet attained, none in prudence can exact from me; nor dare I hope to have done it. However I propo&s;e to my &s;elf to injure no man, but every where to &s;tudy moderation. So they who take offence, ought to be offended with my Authors not with me. There are &s;ome perhaps who believe I might have &s;poken more in matter of Religion, others that I have &s;aid too much, certainly I had rather I could have omit|ted all; &s;o ungratefull to me are the Altercations of Chri&s;tians among them&s;elves in matters of Religion, chiefly where the Deci&s;ions tend to Force and Arms. For they who think mutual Love and Charity is only due to men of their own &s;ect, certainly wander much from the &s;cope of Chri&s;tian perfection, according to the precepts of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>I have not aim'd at my own advantage, nor my own increa&s;e of Repu|tation, hard to be acquir'd, now the world is &s;o fertile in &s;oaring Genius's, I have only endeavoured to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure profitable to the Commonwealth of Chri&s;tianity and Learning, out of a peculiar kindne&s;s, to that, for ought we know, mo&s;t ancient Nation of the <HI>Ha|be&s;&s;ines:</HI> I confe&s;s I have frequently bewail'd their misfortune for this, that the enmitie ran &s;o high between them and the Portugue&s;&s;es, that for their &s;akes all the other Europeans are &s;u&s;pected to that Nation, and not permitted to have any commerce among them. But it has afforded me much more matter of grief, that there &s;hould be &s;uch and &s;o great Animo&s;ity nmong the We&s;tern Chri&s;tians, that as things &s;tand, there is no Coun&s;ell or help to be afforded for the ea&s;e and re&s;titution of the Ea&s;tern Church, or for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Barbarous <HI>Idolaters.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF ETHIOPIA: OR THE KINGDOM <HI>of the</HI> ABESSINES.</HEAD>
<P>_I Am now about to write the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines;</HI> concerning whom, there have been many large, but few true Relations. For the&s;e People having tran&s;lated them&s;elves from the Maritime Regions of the <HI>Arabian Gulf,</HI> into the more upland Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> by rea&s;on their Commerce with Foreigners has been very incon&s;iderable, have been known to very few of the <HI>Europeans.</HI> Be&s;ides that the Name of <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> which they a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves, is common to &s;o many Nations, that it has render'd their Hi&s;tory very ambiguous; for that many things generally &s;poken of the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> were more particularly attributed to the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines.</HI> Neither were they wanting to their own honour, while they appropriated to them&s;elves whatever was &s;aid either in Scri|pture or el&s;ewhere to their advantage.</P>
<P>Others there are, who to wa&s;t their idle hours, and de|&s;igning &s;ome fabulous Inventions, or to repre&s;ent the Plat|form of &s;ome Imaginary Common-Wealth, have cho&s;en <HI>Ethiopia</HI> for the Subject of their Di&s;cour&s;e. Believing they could not more plea&s;antly Romance, or more &s;afely licen&s;e

Age, and then an Exile, for that contrary to the King's Com|mand, he had followed the Fathers of the Society into <HI>In|dia,</HI> and con&s;equently exerci&s;ed in Misfortune, he had laid a&s;ide all <HI>Levity</HI> and <HI>O&s;tentation,</HI> the Vices of <HI>Fortunate Youth.</HI> So that although in truth, I was &s;ufficiently able, by vertue of his In&s;tructions, and the knowledge which I obtained from him of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language, to have out done all tho&s;e that have gone before me, yet I was unwilling to refell the Errors of others upon the Credit of one &s;ingle Per&s;on, till I had more Authorities to &s;upport me.</P>
<P>Nor did I therefore underake this difficult Task, only to con&s;ume my lei&s;ure hours in confuting the Errors, or mu|&s;tering up the different Opinions of Authors, without any pro&s;pect of <HI>Publick-Benefit.</HI> The Hi&s;tory it &s;elf of this Nati|on de&s;erves the Labour of an Accurate Pen. For whether you con&s;ider the Temper of the Clime, or the Condition of the Soyl, you &s;hall hardly find in any other Part of the World more frequent Miracles of Nature.</P>
<P>The Countrey is &s;ituated between the <HI>Tropic of Cancer,</HI> and the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> and enjoys a wonderful variety of Air: The Champion Levels feel the Heat, the Hilly Parts are no le&s;s &s;ubject to Cold. For this rea&s;on, the Thunders are mo&s;t dreadful, and frequent Tempe&s;ts terrifie both Man and Bea&s;ts. Their Prodigious Mountains over-look the Clouds them&s;elves. Neither <HI>Olympus</HI> nor <HI>Athos,</HI> here accoun|ted Wonders; nor <HI>Atlas</HI> it &s;elf, which the Ancients fancied to be the Support of Heaven, are to be compared with them. Their Rocks of various Shapes and Figures, &s;o ama|zingly &s;teep as not to be a&s;cended, yet inhabited. Their &s;urrounded Valleys rugged, and repre&s;enting <HI>Aby&s;&s;es</HI> for profun|dity. Metals they al&s;o have; but chiefly Gold, did they know how to find and dig it forth. Their drye&s;t places in Winter are overflowed in Summer: For tho&s;e Advantages which the Rains afford the Fields in other places, the Ri|vers &s;upply in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Among tho&s;e Rivers, <HI>Nilus</HI> for va&s;tne&s;s and fame, far exceeds all the Rivers of the whole World: Who&s;e Fountains &s;o diligently &s;ought by the Anci|ents are not only here found, but it al&s;o now appears, that the River <HI>Niger</HI> is no more than its left Channel. Nor do all the Rivers of <HI>Haba&s;&s;ia,</HI> as in other Places, empty them|&s;elves into the Sea, but are &s;ome of them &s;uckt up in the Sand; &s;o that it is more difficult to find the Mouths of tho&s;e,

than the Sources of other Streams. Plants they have of ad|mirable Vertue; and Bea&s;ts of all &s;orts, many of which are unknown to us. The large&s;t al&s;o both of Foul and four-footed Bea&s;ts are here to be found. The celebrated Unicorn, &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;ought for in all other Corners of the World, was fir&s;t &s;een here. Cattel without number, much larger than ours, feed in the va&s;t Woods, affording Pa&s;ture &s;ufficient as well for the Wild as Tame. Nor is the variety of the Nati|ons and People le&s;s to be admired; &s;o &s;trangely differing in Language, Cu&s;toms, and Ceremonies, that it may be thought &s;ome di&s;tinct Part of the World, rather than a particular King|dom.</P>
<P>However all <HI>Abe&s;&s;inia</HI> Obeys one King, who by rea&s;on of certain Princes that are &s;ubject to him, calls him&s;elf <HI>Ne|gu&s;a naga&s;t zait joperia,</HI> King of the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> He derives his De&s;cent from <HI>Solomon</HI> King of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> by an ambitious, tho dubious Claim; defending the long &s;eries of his Family, whether true or fal&s;e, with the force of Anti|quity. However it be, this is certain, That the Monarchy of the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines,</HI> and the Royal Line, are no le&s;s Ancient than any among the <HI>Europeans.</HI> And for their Power, they were formerly more Potent than any other of the <HI>African</HI> Kings: But their Wars in the preceding Age with the <HI>Adelen&s;es,</HI> has brought them very low. Afterwards they were &s;o debilitated by the Fury of the <HI>Gallani,</HI> that <HI>Abe&s;&s;inia</HI> is &s;carce to be found in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> it &s;elf, if you compare it with what it was in the times of <HI>Alvarezius.</HI></P>
<P>But that which de&s;erves the greate&s;t admiration is the an|tiquity of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which fir&s;t began under S. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> at what time <HI>Frumen|tius</HI> Preached among them; the Opinions and Ceremonies of which Church they &s;till retain. So that many Primitive Rites in other Places ob&s;olete, are here &s;till in U&s;e. But that deplorable Schi&s;m which aro&s;e in the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> for which they alledge other Cau&s;es than our Writers do, withdrew the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> all together from the <HI>Catholick</HI> Church, at that time Flouri&s;hing; while they followed the Patriarch of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and rejected the Patriarch of the <HI>Melchites.</HI> Yet all this while for &s;o many Ages they have &s;uffered no con|&s;iderable Change in their Divine Wor&s;hip till the beginning of this la&s;t Century, at what time being &s;plit into Divi&s;ions by the Artifices of the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> they have been cruelly &s;haken
<PB N="6" REF="8">
with Civil Di&s;cord and Bloody Wars; &s;ome Adhering to the <HI>Romi&s;h,</HI> other the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Of which and other things it is our De&s;ign to treat more fully in this our Hi&s;tory; and &s;o to handle the matter, as to di&s;cour&s;e in the Fir&s;t Book, Of Natural Things; as the Situation and Names of the &s;everal Counties, the Temper of the Climate, the Condition of the Soyl, the &s;everal Cu|&s;toms and Languages of the Nations and Inhabitants. In the Second Book, Of the Political Government, the Succe&s;&s;ion of their Kings, their Laws, their Acts of War, the Revenue of the Kingdom, and the like. In the Third, Of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, the beginning of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and its Advance in tho&s;e Countries, their Differences with the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Church. And La&s;tly, in the Fourth Book, Of their Dome&s;tick Concerns, and Private Oeconomy.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Vulgar Chorographic Table or Mapp of <HI>Ha|be&s;&s;inia,</HI> and the Author's new one.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The New Mapp of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines.</HI> The new one found fault with as Erro|neous: Look'd on as ridiculous by <HI>Gregory;</HI> by rea&s;on of the ill writing and becau&s;e of the ill under&s;tood Names of <HI>Barnaga&s;&s;us, Tigremahon, Am|biancantiva,</HI> which are explained.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BUT to the End that all things may the more clearly appear, we &s;hall produce a new Chorographical Mapp of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> the old one that goes begging about the World for an Author, being altogether uncertain. I was not a little a&s;ham'd to hear the &s;edulous <HI>Ethiopian, Gre|gory,</HI> upbraiding as he did, the vanity and carele&s;ne&s;s of our People, to obtrude &s;uch ab&s;urdities upon the Commonweal of Learning, and to defile otherwi&s;e mo&s;t<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot">As tho&s;e of <HI>Ortelius, Jan&s;onius;</HI> the <HI>Atlas</HI>'s of <HI>Gerand, Mercator, Bleau,</HI> and others.</NOTE> beautiful Pieces of Geography, with &s;uch fabulous impertinencies. While they made public to the World Mapps of &s;uch con&s;equence,
<PB N="20" REF="16">
without any &s;ufficient Authority, or any light by what Pen, of what Nation, or in what Language they were fir&s;t written, as if they de&s;igned on purpo&s;e to deceive the Reader, that &s;o he might not be in a Capacity to judge of the Truth: which if it were their aim, they did not mi&s;s of their intentions, in regard they led &s;everal per&s;ons, otherwi&s;e eminent, and of great judgment, into foul mi&s;takes, who cryed up the Empire of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> for the large&s;t in the World, as being little le&s;s than all <HI>Europe,</HI> too unwarily tru&s;ting to their fictions.</P>
<P>When I fir&s;t &s;hewed the vulgar Mapps to <HI>Gregory,</HI> &s;ome|times I made him laugh, &s;ometimes I made him angry. For before I call'd to mind that the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters were to be pro|nounced after the <HI>Portugal</HI> mannet, I asked him concerning the Kingdoms of <HI>Xoa, Gojam,</HI> and other Regions, from whence the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> had either taken away, or to which they had added the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters, <HI>a, d, do,</HI> as being their Articles of declen&s;ion,<NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>As</HI> Abugno, <HI>for</HI> Bugna, Barua; <HI>wor&s;e</HI> Barua, <HI>for</HI> Dobarua; Amara <HI>for</HI> Amhara; Ambadora, <HI>for</HI> Ambadarho, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> without any regard to the Letter <HI>h.</HI> But when I expected an An&s;wer, he knew not what I meant, till I pronounced for <HI>Ksoa, Shoa;</HI> for <HI>Goyam, Gojam,</HI> and &s;o on|ward: But he laughed outright when I que&s;tion'd him con|cerning the Kingdoms of <HI>Barnaga&s;&s;us, Tigremahon,</HI><NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot">In the vulgar Tables al&s;o you &s;hall find <HI>Tigre</HI> and <HI>Tigray,</HI> as if they were two di&s;tinct Kingdoms: Which error <HI>B.

For <HI>Barnaga&s;&s;o</HI> in the <HI>Amharic</HI> Language extends it &s;elf to <HI>Bahr-Naga&s;h,</HI> a compound word of <HI>Bahr</HI> which &s;igni|fies the Sea, and <HI>Naga&s;h</HI> a Governour, as much as to &s;ay a Commander or Admiral at Sea. <HI>Tigremahon</HI> corruptly for <HI>Tigre-macuonen,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Judge or Pre&s;ident of <HI>Tigre: Ambian-cantiva,</HI> for <HI>Dembea-cantiba,</HI> that is, Governour or Pre|&s;ident of <HI>Dembea.</HI> The &s;ame inference happens to the mo&s;t noble City and Court of Royal Re&s;idence, <HI>Axuma,</HI> which ne|ver appears in the Mapps, by rea&s;on that the <HI>Portugals</HI> pro|nounce <HI>Axum, Aca&s;&s;um;</HI> for they ca&s;t away the <HI>A,</HI> as an Ar|ticle of declen&s;ion, and adding their own termination <HI>O,</HI> made
<PB N="21" REF="16">
it <HI>Ca&s;&s;umo.</HI> Upon which City we &s;tood pau&s;ing a long time, before we could tell what to make of it. I pa&s;s by an innumerable company of other mi&s;takes, which rendred the Mapp altogether u&s;ele&s;s to me. Nor is it to be doubted but the &s;ame thing often falls out in other Exotic Tables: So that unle&s;s a Man can divine the Language of the Author, or where he was born; it is impo&s;&s;ible but he mu&s;t read the Names of the plaes mo&s;t extravagantly. For we find that becau&s;e the Modern <HI>Europeans</HI> have no Letters of their own, but onely have accommodated the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters to their own &s;ounds, it comes to pa&s;s, that one and the &s;ame Letter is variou&s;ly pronounced by various Nations; which frequently appears in Con&s;onants conjoyned. As for Example, <HI>Ch,</HI> among the <HI>Germans, Belgians</HI> and <HI>Polonians,</HI> is a rough A&s;piration like the <HI>Hebrew</HI> &het;, or the <HI>Greek</HI> &KHgr;. Among the <HI>Italians Ch,</HI> is pronounced like a <HI>k,</HI> among the <HI>French</HI> like an <HI>Hebrew</HI> &shin;. But among the <HI>Engli&s;h, Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> who alone genuinely pronounce the word <HI>China,</HI> there is a kind of hi&s;&s;ing compos'd between the Letter <HI>Z.</HI> and <HI>&s;ch.</HI> which the <HI>Italians</HI> expre&s;s by a <HI>C</HI> before <HI>e</HI> or <HI>i;</HI> the <HI>Polonians</HI> by <HI>Ch,</HI> the <HI>Hebrews</HI> more lively in their &shin;, the <HI>Germans <HI>Sch,</HI></HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by <HI>Sh,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Ch, the <HI>Italians</HI> Sc before <HI>e,</HI> and <HI>i;</HI> and which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> would do by their Letter <HI>X,</HI> but that they are unwilling to have it a &s;uperfluous Letter in their Alphabet.</P>
<P>For which rea&s;on it would be very requi&s;ite, that the Publi&s;hers of Foraign Mapps, &s;hould al&s;o Publi&s;h their In&s;tructions, and tell the World according to what Pro|nounciation, the Names of Countries and Cities ought to be read: Or el&s;e that in the compiling of &s;ome univer&s;al Geographical Work, care might be taken to add &s;uch an Index as &s;hould be the &s;tandard of Pronunciation in every Country, to prevent the common mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t acknowledge that our Chorographick Table is not without its defects: For though <HI>Gregorie</HI> were &s;ufficiently skill'd in the Names and Situation of places, yet he was ignorant of the Degrees of the Sphere and Elevation of the Pole. Therefore in the fir&s;t Mapps of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> which I made, I follow'd the Longitude and Latitude of the vulgar Tables; but becau&s;e I found them fal&s;e in that too, we thought it more prudence not to Publi&s;h any at all.

For that the Air is colder upon the Mountains, all Nations in their own Countries find by experience; but that the Air is cold of it &s;elf, and not warmed but by the repercu&s;&s;ion of the Suns beams among the exhalations of the Earth, is the opinion of other &s;age Philo&s;ophers: which exhalations in the lower Region near the Earth ri&s;e more clo&s;e and condens'd, in the upper parts, more thin and rarify'd; &s;o that tho the lower parts frie with heat, high places freez, the cool nature of the Air not &s;uffering any alteration through the defect of heat.</P>
<P>Therefore the higher you a&s;cend the Mountains of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> from the coa&s;t of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the more temperate you &s;hall feel the Air; in&s;omuch that as <HI>Tellezius</HI> witne&s;&s;es in many Regions of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the Summer heats are more mild then in <HI>Portugal,</HI> &s;o many degrees di&s;tant toward the North. Nay there are &s;ome Mountainous Countries, as in <HI>Samen</HI> where the cold is more dreaded than the heat. Neverthele&s;s there falls none or very little Snow in tho&s;e parts, only a certain &s;mall &s;ort of Hail &s;ometimes covers the ground, which at a
<PB N="24" REF="18">
di&s;tance looks like Snow. It was a thing not known to <HI>Gregorie,</HI> for as I Travelled with him over the Mountains of <HI>Tirol,</HI> toward the end of <HI>September,</HI> &s;eeing &s;ome Snow that had fallen a little before, crying out <HI>Haritz, Haritz,</HI> full of admiration, he called it Meal. From &s;uch a temper of the Air it follows that the Country mu&s;t needs be healthy; and con&s;equently the Inhabitants &s;ane and vivacious, in&s;omuch that &s;ome of them live to a hundred years of Age. Onely in <HI>Tigra,</HI> toward the beginning of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Spring, that is to &s;ay, in the Months of <HI>September</HI> and <HI>October,</HI> Feavers are very ri&s;e.</P>
<P>However this variety of the Air is the cau&s;e of mo&s;t dreadful Thunders. Which when <HI>Gregory</HI> de&s;crib'd, he a&s;toni&s;h'd his hearers. For upon the ri&s;ing of &s;everal Tem|pe&s;ts altogether, the Skie is of a &s;udden cover'd over with black and thick as it were Globes of &s;mokie Clouds; by and by the Thunder breaks forth on every &s;ide, ratling con|tinually, with Lightning as ince&s;&s;antly fla&s;hing, enough to amaze the mo&s;t re&s;olute and mo&s;t accu&s;tom'd to the noi&s;e. Their Rains are very violent, powering from the Clouds not by drops, but as it were in &s;treams. With tho&s;e the torrents being &s;well'd, rowle along with that rapid fury, that they carry Trees and Stones and all things before 'em. All their Rivers overflow; and then the high ways being either covered with water, or el&s;e all mirie and dirtie, 'tis a mo&s;t tedious thing to Travel: And this enduring three Months together renders their Winters very unplea&s;ant. <HI>Gregory</HI> de&s;crib'd the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Winter to me in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Winters are not caus'd onely by the Rain which falls from the Skie; for the Earth al&s;o opens her mouth, and vomits up water.

<P>Now what the Winter of that Coa&s;t is, you may ea&s;ily gue&s;s, from the an&s;wer of <HI>Gregory,</HI> who being ask'd upon a very &s;ultry day, whether it were not very hot in <HI>Germany,</HI> made an&s;wer,</P>

<P>For which rea&s;on we rather ought to conclude, that there are but three Sea&s;ons among the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ines,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Spring which begins upon the 25th of <HI>September.</HI> Then the Summer, which may be divided into two parts; the fir&s;t, and the be&s;t, call'd <HI>Tzadai,</HI> which begins upon the 25th of <HI>December;</HI> and the la&s;t, and wor&s;t part, call'd <HI>Hagai,</HI> which begins upon the 25th of <HI>June,</HI> and ends upon the<NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gregory</HI> differs from our Poet one day, who puts it upon the <HI>26th.</HI></NOTE> &s;uccee|ding Winter, which is the third part of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> year.</P>
<P>The Days and Nights in that Climate, being in a right Sphere, are, for the mo&s;t part, always equal.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Many Rivers there more precious than Metals. The Fountains originally from Rain-water. An Encomium of <HI>Nilus:</HI> In Scripture it is call'd, The River <GAP DESC="foreign">, and <HI>Schichor,</HI> or <HI>Niger:</HI> By &s;ome of the ancients <HI>A&s;tapus,</HI> and <HI>A&s;taboras:</HI> In the <HI>Amharic</HI> Dialect call'd <HI>Abawi,</HI> or the <HI>Patent of Rivers;</HI> it flows not in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> as &s;ome of the Fathers thought.

<P>BUT much more excelling, and far more precious Gifts of Nature than tho&s;e of Metals, flow from the Mountains of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, &s;everal remarkable Rivers more profitable to the Natives, and the neighbouring Nations, than Gold it &s;elf, &s;o much the Sub|ject of human Avarice. For the Rain-water &s;oaking through the pores of the Earth, and the clefts of the Rocks, is re|ceiv'd, and, as it were, ci&s;tern'd up in the hidden Caverns of the Mountains, where, after it has pa&s;s'd through many &s;ecret conveyances of Nature, at length it meets with &s;ome hollow place, and breaks forth. Sometimes oppre&s;s'd by its own weight, it rea&s;cends, and &s;eeks for pa&s;&s;age at the tops of the Mountains them&s;elves; which is the rea&s;on, that in Countries where there is little or no Rain, there are few or no Fountains; but where there are frequent Rains, the Ri+vers are large and &s;welling: The Effect demon&s;trating the

About a Mu&s;quet Shot from thence, toward the Ea&s;t, the River begins to flow; then winding to the North, about the fourth part of a League, it receives another River; a little farther, two more flowing from the Ea&s;t fall into it; and &s;oon after, it enlarges it &s;elf with the addition of &s;everal other Streams.

This the ancient <HI>Egyptian</HI> Prie&s;ts were not ignorant of; for <HI>Herodotus,</HI> the foremo&s;t in Hi|&s;tory, after he has di&s;cours'd concerning the Springs of <HI>Nile,</HI> learnedly reports, That he had heard from an Auditor of the Money &s;acred to <HI>Minerva,</HI> That half of the Water of <HI>Nile</HI> flow'd Northward into <HI>Egypt,</HI> the other half Southward toward <HI>Ethiopia:</HI> Which none of our Geographers either ob&s;erv'd or mended.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Clim.</HI> 1. <HI>Part.</HI> 4.</NOTE> But the <HI>Nubian</HI> Geographer puts me quite out of doubt, when he writes,</P>
<P><HI>And in this part of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>are the two</HI> Niles <HI>parted;</HI> that is, <HI>Nilus</HI> which waters out Country of <HI>Nubia,</HI> directs his Cour&s;e from South to North, and mo&s;t of the Cities of <HI>Egypt</HI> are &s;eated on each &s;ide of his Banks, and in his I&s;lands. The other part of <HI>Nile</HI> flows from the Ea&s;t toward the We&s;t, and upon this part of <HI>Nile</HI> lies the whole Country of the <HI>Nigrites,</HI> or at lea&s;t the greater part of it.</P>
<P>A little after he adds concerning a certain Mountain; <HI>And near to that, one of the Arms of</HI> Nile <HI>turns off, and flows to the We&s;t:</HI> And this is the <HI>Nile</HI> that belongs to the Country of the <HI>Nigrites,</HI> many of their Provinces lying upon it. But near the Ea&s;tern &s;ide of the Mountain, the other Arm turns off, waters the Country of <HI>Nubia,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and is divided in the <HI>Lower Egypt</HI> into four parts, of which three fall into the <HI>Syrian</HI> Sea, and the other empties it &s;elf in a Salt Lake which is near to <HI>Alexandria</HI> The words are every way mo&s;t clear; and very probable it is, That the &s;eparation of the two <HI>Niles</HI> might be caus'd by the re&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome rocky Mountain that con&s;train'd the two Streams to part, &s;ince they could not undermine it. To which, the words of <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> relate; <HI>The Region of the</HI> Nigrites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In De&s;cript. <HI>Afric.</HI> l. <HI>1.</HI> c. <HI>7.</HI></NOTE> <HI>through which</HI> Nilus <HI>is &s;aid to flow:</HI> Which &s;eem to intimate, that he had heard &s;omething by report concerning this &s;ame
<PB N="40" REF="26">
left Channel. Nor am I a little confirm'd by the judgment of <HI>Gregory,</HI> which he expre&s;&s;ed to me by writing, in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><HI>But as to what is reported, that</HI> Nile <HI>does not flow altogether and entirely into the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>but that it is divided another way. This all tho&s;e per&s;ons of whom I have enquir'd, averr to me to be truth. This I al&s;o encline to believe, for &s;hould it de&s;cend en|tirely thither in the Winter time, the</HI> Egyptians <HI>could never be &s;afe in their Hou&s;es.</HI> But as to what concerns its &s;eparation, they &s;ay, That Parting happens after the River has pa&s;s'd by <HI>Sen|nar</HI> in the Country of <HI>Dengula,</HI> before it arrives in <HI>Nubia:</HI> However, they &s;ay, That the greate&s;t ma&s;s of Water flows into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and that the &s;eparated part runs directly to the we&s;tern Ocean; yet &s;o, that it comes not into <HI>Barbary,</HI> but de&s;cends toward the Country of <HI>Elwah,</HI> and &s;o throws it &s;elf into the we&s;tern Ocean.</P>
<P>Now that the River <HI>Niger</HI> &s;hould be the left Channel of <HI>Nile,</HI> is mo&s;t probable from hence, for that as <HI>Pliny</HI> writes, and Experience confirms,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>l.</HI> 5. <HI>c.</HI> 8.</NOTE> it <HI>partakes of the &s;ame Conditions</HI> with it, agrees in colour and ta&s;t of the Water, it produces the &s;ame &s;ort of Reed, the &s;ame &s;ort of Papyr, and the &s;ame &s;ort of Animals; and la&s;tly, encrea&s;es and overflows at the &s;ame Sea&s;ons. Neither does the Name it &s;elf contradict the Conjecture, in regard that, as we have &s;aid, <HI>Nilus</HI> it &s;elf is by the <HI>Hebrews</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd <HI>Niger.</HI> But as to what the <HI>Egyptian</HI> related to <HI>Herodotus,</HI> That the left Channel flow'd toward the South, that perhaps might be for &s;uch a certain di&s;tance of Land, not but that afterwards it might vary its Cour&s;e, and wind toward the We&s;t. Which opinion, after I had communicated to the mo&s;t famous <HI>Bochart,</HI> &s;o highly skill'd both in the ancient and modern Geography, and the be&s;t Judge of the&s;e matters, he wrote me in an&s;wer, <HI>Il e&s;t tres vray, que le Niger e&s;t une partie du Nile; Mo&s;t certain it is, that</HI> Niger <HI>is a part of</HI> Nile.</P>
<P>Now follows a Que&s;tion, no le&s;s admirable than it is of moment; <HI>Whether it be in the power of the</HI> Aby&s;&s;ine <HI>Kings &s;o to divert the Court of</HI> Nile, <HI>that it &s;hould not overflow</HI> Egypt?

<P>I could wi&s;h to hear the opinions of tho&s;e that deny this place. The words are clear of them&s;elves, that the King commanded the Channel that was &s;topp'd to be open'd. The Hi&s;torian him&s;elf is accounted a credible Author, bred and born in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as al&s;o Secretary to the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes of that Country. So that he could not po&s;&s;ibly be ignorant of &s;uch an accident; and be&s;ides, he wrote his Hi&s;tory above a hundred and twenty years after the thing happen'd: And therefore had it been an untruth, he dur&s;t not have mention'd it for fear of being contradicted, which he might ea&s;ily have been. But it may be objected, That the Hi&s;torian does not
<PB N="42" REF="27">
mention by whom the Channel was ob&s;tructed, or whether it happen'd, as many times it does, naturally, when the cour&s;e of a Stream is damm'd up by trunks of Trees, Mud and Stones driven by force, and heap'd together in the nar|row pa&s;&s;ages of the Water. But this Objection does not re|&s;olve the doubt; for &s;uch remarkable &s;tops rarely or never happen in &s;uch large or violent Rivers. Or if Nature could effect &s;o much, what might not be accompli&s;h'd by Art? <HI>Athana&s;ius Kircher,</HI> a per&s;on not only generally vers'd in the Affair of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but more particularly in what related to the River <HI>Nile,</HI> in his Catalogue of the Patriarchs of <HI>Egypt,</HI> re|lates, That one<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">In Supplement. Prod. and Lexic. Capt. <HI>p. 524. c. 2.</HI> This <HI>Michael</HI> was the <HI>68th</HI> Patriarch of the <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and dy'd about the year <HI>1110.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Michael</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> for the re&s;to|ring of <HI>Nile</HI> to its Channel, from whence the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> had directed the Cour&s;e of its Waters; tho it be the fault of that learned Man to write much, rather than accurately; nor does he always commend his Authors. The Que&s;tion being put to <HI>Gregory,</HI> he did not remember the Story of <HI>Michael,</HI> but that he had heard from per&s;ons of great Credit, That not far from the Cataracts of <HI>Nile,</HI> all the Land toward the Ea&s;t lies level; and unle&s;s it were for one Mountain that &s;tands in the way, <HI>Nile</HI> would rather flow that way, than into <HI>Egypt</HI> or the Northern Sea. So that if that Mountain were digg'd through, a thing to be done with pains and difficulty, the Cour&s;e of the River might be turn'd and carry'd into the <HI>Red-Sea;</HI> which is well known to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and many of the <HI>Portugals:</HI> And for this rea&s;on have the Emperours of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> obtain'd tho&s;e advantagious Conditions from the <HI>Sa|racens.</HI> Nay, it is &s;aid, That once one of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Em|perours had an intention to have done it, and had comman|ded his Subjects to undertake the Work, but that he was prevail'd upon to de&s;i&s;t at the entreaty of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, this thing has very much perplex'd my thoughts; nor are the Rea&s;ons that are brought again&s;t it to be contemn'd: For either to rai&s;e a Mole or Dam of Stones, and then to remove it again, are things requiring &s;o much toyl and labour, that the Task does no way agree with the nature of the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines.</HI> And it &s;eems &s;omewhat unlikely, that &s;o va&s;t a River, &s;o long accu&s;tom'd to a declining and
<PB N="43" REF="27">
headlong Cour&s;e, &s;hould be diverted and compell'd to change its Channel. I con&s;ider'd al&s;o with my &s;elf, that if the King of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> had the River <HI>Nile</HI> &s;o much in his Power, he might have all <HI>Egypt</HI> ea&s;ily at his Devotion, and that the <HI>Turk</HI> could deny him nothing whatever he demanded. Nor would he ever &s;uffer the Chri&s;tians of his own Religion, and the Patriarch, who is the Head of his Church, to groan under &s;uch a mi&s;erable Bondage. La&s;tly, I did not a little wonder, that the Je&s;uits did not in&s;inuate it into the heads of the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines</HI> to make u&s;e of that Power which Nature had put into their hands, and that they did not u&s;e Threats, rather than Intreaties and Bribes to obtain tho&s;e convenien|cies which they enjoy by the favour of the <HI>Turki&s;h Ba&s;ha,</HI> who commands the Ports of the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI> But all things con&s;ider'd, and rejecting the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Elmacine,</HI> we may an&s;wer <HI>Tellez</HI> from the Relation of <HI>Gregory,</HI> which is, That a new Channel may be carry'd on, not from tho&s;e parts of <HI>Abe&s;&s;inia,</HI> which lie upon the <HI>Nile,</HI> and are &s;o many Leagues di&s;tant from the Sea; but from that part which is near the Cataracts, and formerly perhaps belong'd to <HI>Nubia.</HI> My fir&s;t Opinion was, That the Channel of <HI>Nile</HI> could no where be &s;o ea&s;ily alter'd as in that place where it divides it &s;elf into two Channels, for that there, by the direction of Nature her &s;elf, it &s;eem'd, that the whole might be more ea&s;ily turn'd another way, where a part turns naturally without compul|&s;ion. For tho other Rivers empty them&s;elves into <HI>Nile</HI> be|yond this &s;eparation, and flow into <HI>Egypt,</HI> yet are they not enough to make the Inundation &s;o great as nece&s;&s;ity requires; which would not only be the ruin of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but a great di|minution of the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Power. But however it be, this I believe to be certain, That the King of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> is now no more Lord of tho&s;e places where the River <HI>Nile</HI> ever was, or ever can be diverted from <HI>Nile;</HI> nor are the Princes of tho&s;e places now at his Devotion; neither are they indeed <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> but unhappily revolted to <HI>Pagani&s;m.</HI> So that what|ever formerly might have been done, cannot now be brought to pa&s;s; not that the nature of the place ob&s;tructs the de&s;ign, but that the Prince of the Country wants Power, or el&s;e has no inclination to the Project. Otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not think it either ab&s;urd or improbable, that &s;ome Rivers that make their way through the high Fields of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> might be convey'd another way by the de&s;cents of the Hill, through
<PB N="44" REF="28">
the &s;andy Levels that lye below to a va&s;t diminution of the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Stream, provided that skilful Arti&s;ts were employ'd to &s;urvey the declivities of the places, and the places mo&s;t proper to carry off the Water. For though it be a difficult thing to alter the Cour&s;e and Limits of Rivers, which Na|ture has &s;ettl'd, yet Examples are not wanting. We read in <HI>Herodotus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>L.</HI> 1. <HI>call'd</HI> Clio.</NOTE> That <HI>Nitocres</HI> King of the <HI>Babylonians</HI> turn'd the Cour&s;e of <HI>Euphratis</HI> &s;everal ways, by &s;inking &s;everal new Cuts and Dikes. And <HI>Cyrus</HI> King of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> being in wroth with the River <HI>Gyndes,</HI> by rea&s;on of one of the Sacred white Hor&s;es drown'd therein, divided it into a hun|dred and &s;ixty &s;mall Streams, the Summer's labour of his whole Army.</P>
<P>But there are other remarkable Rivers that owe for their Springs to <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Nilus.</HI> Of the&s;e the mo&s;t fa|mous is <HI>Tacaz&egrave;,</HI> which ri&s;ing in <HI>Angota,</HI> not far from <HI>Ba|gemdra,</HI> out of the Mountain <HI>Ahguaga,</HI> divides <HI>Tigra</HI> and <HI>Wal|kajit,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing through the <HI>Ethiopian Nomades,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Dequin,</HI> at length falls into <HI>Nile. Melegi,</HI> accor|ding to <HI>Tellez,</HI> takes its ri&s;e in <HI>Damota,</HI> and falls into <HI>Nile</HI> we&s;tward of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia.</HI> As for the other Rivers, &s;ufficiently large, which <HI>Nilus</HI> receives from all the Kingdoms of <HI>Ha|ba&s;&s;ia,</HI> we have &s;et them down in our Chorographical Table, and therefore forbear to name them here.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Rivers, as well as <HI>Nile,</HI> in the Winter time &s;well to that height, as not to be contain'd within their own Banks.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t we omit the admirable nature of two more Rivers, of which the one call'd <HI>Hawa&s;h,</HI> ri&s;ing in the Con|fines of <HI>Shewa</HI> and <HI>Wed,</HI> ha&s;tens into the Kingdom of <HI>Adel,</HI> to quench the drought of tho&s;e thir&s;ty Soyls. Nor are the Inhabitants wanting to them&s;elves; they gladly go to meet their welcom Gue&s;t, and bring it in &s;everal large Cuts to water their Grounds. And thus being frequently intercepted, and wa&s;ted by degrees, as if a&s;ham'd to carry a &s;mall portion of Water to the Sea, it plunges it &s;elf into the Sand. In imi|tation of this, the other River <HI>Mareb,</HI> ri&s;ing in <HI>Tigra,</HI> not far from <HI>Fremonia,</HI> encompa&s;&s;es a great part of that Kingdom; then falling into the Kingdom of the <HI>Cafers,</HI> as if the Stream di&s;dain'd that Nation, it hides it &s;elf for a long &s;pace under ground; yet not &s;o, but that it affords both Water and Fi&s;h to them that dig eight or ten &s;pans deep, and at length di|&s;per&s;es

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE fertility of the Soyl in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> is to be ad|mir'd; for the Land where it admits of Tillage, abounds in all &s;orts of Fruits. The long Summers affording that extraordinary plenty, that in the &s;ame place you &s;hall find Seed-time and Harve&s;t; which is in &s;ome pla|ces double, in other places threefold. For Grain and Pul&s;e the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> have not only tho&s;e known to us, as Wheat, Barley, Millet, and the like; but al&s;o another &s;ort unknown to us, which they call <HI>Tef,</HI> which makes very good Bread: The Seed of it is extreamly &s;mall, le&s;s than Pepper, but longer. Rye they have none: Yet when <HI>Gregory</HI> &s;melt to a Rye Loaf, he &s;aid, It was the true <HI>Tef,</HI> and that it had the true &s;mell of <HI>Tef.</HI> He look'd upon Oats as not worth &s;ow|ing, &s;aying, It was no better e&s;teem'd than Cockle in their Country: For that Barley or Gra&s;s only was the general Food of their Hor&s;es. They neither &s;ow nor mow, for the &s;ake of their Cattel; Gra&s;s abounding in the more tempe|rate places; by rea&s;on of the perpetual heat, and the moi|&s;ture continually di&s;tilling from the Mountains: For the &s;olid Stones not admitting the Rain, the Water falls off from them, and &s;preading under the fertile Turf, wonderfully recreates and enlivens the growing Plants. For which rea&s;on, the Fields are always plea&s;ing and verdant, always &s;miling with a flowry Grace. From whence an extraordinary &s;uperfluity of Honey, the Trees being &s;o plentifully fed.

of &s;uch abundance, the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> neither lay up, nor pro|vide again&s;t the years en&s;uing, whether tru&s;ting to their Plenty, or de&s;titute of Store-hou&s;es. They never &s;tack their Hay; tho for the &s;ake of the Locu&s;ts it many times falls out to be very nece&s;&s;ary. For that &s;ame pe&s;tilent Vermin devou|ring Corn and Gra&s;s, occa&s;ions frequent Famines, de&s;tructive to Man and Bea&s;t. <HI>Grtgory,</HI> ob&s;erving afar off certain Cart|loads of Hay, compar'd them to Elephants at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Herbs of all &s;orts grow in this Country, not only the fra|grant and medicinal Plants of <HI>Europe,</HI> but &s;ome more peculi|ar, and of admirable vertue. The <HI>Amadmagda</HI> cures broken and di&s;-joynted Bones, contrary to the <HI>O&s;&s;ifraga</HI> of <HI>Norway,</HI> which &s;naps the Bones of Cattel that tread upon it. The Herb <HI>A&s;&s;azoe</HI> is of that rare vertue again&s;t the biting of <HI>A&s;ps,</HI> that the mo&s;t hurtful Serpents touch'd with this Herb, are &s;treight intoxicated, and lye for dead. He that eats of the Root of this Herb, may walk without danger in the mid&s;t of Adders and Water-Snakes, and for many years &s;hall be free from the fear of them: In &s;o much, that &s;ome of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> have been &s;een, after they have eaten of this Root, to han|dle the mo&s;t venomous Snakes like Eels, twi&s;t 'em about their Necks; and then to kill 'em, when they had done &s;hewing tricks with 'em. So Providence ordering the mo&s;t efficacious Remedies where the Poy&s;ons are mo&s; pernicious. Which makes me believe that it was not a thing peculiar, or a particular faculty in the <HI>P&s;ylli,</HI> an ancient People of <HI>Africa,</HI> that they could cure the biting of Serpents, but got by the u&s;e of this Herb; only they kept the thing &s;ecret to render them&s;elves the more admired. For they made a Trade of it, by carrying Venemous Animals about the World without danger, for the &s;ight whereof, the more curious gave them Money. <HI>Garden Saffron,</HI> which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> call <HI>Denguelet,</HI> is frequent in <HI>Habe&s;inia;</HI> the Seed of it <HI>Gregory</HI> &s;hewed me for a great Rarity: and cryed up the Oyl which was to be pre&s;&s;ed out of it, again&s;t the <HI>Hypocondriacal Evil,</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;tructi|ons of the Spleen.</HI> They want Hopps, and boyl their Drink with|out it. And therefore <HI>Gregory</HI> finding, that it was the vertue of the Hopps, which kept our Drink &s;o long, took great care to carry &s;ome of the Seed along with him into his own Coun|try. Their Vine and Grapes are mo&s;t Tran&s;cendant, but they never make any Wines, whether out of ignorance, or becau&s;e the Grapes being ripen'd in Summer, the exce&s;&s;ive

heat ha&s;tens the fermentation and &s;owers the Liquor before the Lee be &s;etled. They abound in Sugar, but as for Pepper, Ginger, and other &s;uch like Spices they have none; rather out of carele&s;ne&s;s to Plant, as I believe, than through the fault of the Soyl; which con&s;idering the variety of the Air, and the continual heat of &s;ome Places, &s;eems mo&s;t proper for &s;uch a &s;ort of Husbandrie. The Indian Figg al&s;o, which the <HI>A|rabians</HI> call <HI>Muz</HI> or <HI>Mauz,</HI> grows plentifully here, a mo&s;t Ex|cellent Fruit it is; and you &s;hall have fifty Figgs, about the bigne&s;s and &s;hape of a Cucumber hanging upon one &s;talk, of a mo&s;t delicious odour and ta&s;te. They are ripe in <HI>June,</HI> as I learnt from the Itinerary of Prince <HI>Radzevile,</HI> who had &s;een &s;ome of them near <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> where they are rare; for they re|quire a hotter Climate. Which Circum&s;tances make me be|lieve, that this &s;ame Fruit may be the <GAP DESC="foreign"> <HI>Dudaim</HI> mention'd in <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> which occa&s;ion'd &s;o much di&s;content between the two Wives of <HI>Jacob.</HI> Soon after I ob&s;erv'd that many others, Learned Men, lighted upon the &s;ame Conjecture, though they do not give their Rea&s;ons. For in my Opinion, it &s;hould be &s;ome rare and plea&s;ant Fruit, that &s;hould move the Boy to gather it; yet not &s;o much a Boy neither, as to think it worth his while to carry home a &s;tinking <HI>Mandrake,</HI> which could be a fruit little worth contending for. Be&s;ides, <HI>Rachel</HI> might have &s;ent her Servant as well to have gathered Amiable Flowers, (as &s;ome render the Word) that is to &s;ay, Lillies, Violets, or the like. And be&s;ides the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word &s;eems to confirm this Opinion: as being in the <HI>dual</HI> Num|ber, and &s;eeming to infer a relation of more than one Fruit to one and the &s;ame Stalk.</P>
<P>Apples and Pears, &s;uch as grow in our Climates, they have none. For at what time they Ripen with us, Storms and Tempe&s;ts rage in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia.</HI> For the Trees, as I have heard the Habe&s;&s;ines acknowledge, ob&s;erve our Sea&s;ons, &s;prout forth and &s;hed their Leaves in the &s;ame Month with ours; but with the Plants it is otherwi&s;e, which Flower there in our Winter. However, they have Pome-Citrons, Abricots, Peaches, and Pomegranates, rip'ned to their full and due Perfection. <HI>Gregory</HI> admired to behold our Woods of tall Firrs, &s;ome &s;eventy, &s;ome eighty Foot high; and often call'd them <HI>Arbores benedictas,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed Trees: e&s;pecially, when he heard how u&s;eful they were towards the building of Ships and Hou&s;es. However we do not find but that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> has
<PB N="51" REF="33">
its &s;hare of tall Trees, as well as other Countries. But the Tree which goes by the Name of <HI>En&s;ete,</HI> is not to be pa&s;s'd over without Admiration; being like that which bears the Indian Figg, two fathoms in thickne&s;s. For being half cut down, it renews again by means of innumerable &s;houts that &s;pring again from the remaining Trunk, all which is fit to be eaten; &s;o that there is no need that the Tree &s;hould bear any other Fruit, it being all Pot-herb of it &s;elf. For being &s;lic'd and boyl'd it a&s;&s;wages the Thir&s;t of the common &s;ort of People, who brui&s;e the Leaves and boyl them with Meal, and then eat the Compo&s;ition in&s;tead of a Ha&s;tie-pudding. There is another Tree which <HI>Godignus</HI> prai&s;es, mo&s;t excellent again&s;t the Worms in the Belly: a Di&s;tem|per frequent among the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines,</HI> by rea&s;on of their fee|ding upon Raw Fle&s;h.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BY rea&s;on of the Plenty of Gra&s;s, and the perpetual heat of the Country, 'tis not to be wondred at, that the Bea&s;ts &s;hould be larger and fuller grown in tho&s;e Countries than in other Regions.

I rather believe, &s;hould be taken for tho&s;e of <HI>Abi&s;&s;inia.</HI> For that <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> was by many of the Ancients compre|hended under the name of <HI>India.</HI> And that Oxen &s;o large &s;hould wear va&s;t Horns, four Foot broad, is as probable al|together, as <HI>Pliny</HI> relates in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P><HI>Africa</HI> was formerly Famous for the Heards and Droves of Cattle fed therein; and at this time there are &s;ome Na|tions that &s;upport them&s;elves meerly by Grazing: of this &s;ort are the <HI>Bektences,</HI> not far from <HI>Suaquena,</HI> who in the <HI>Sum|mer</HI> Inhabit the Mountains; in the <HI>Winter</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves upon the Plains, changing their Seats as the Tempe&s;tuous Sea&s;ons varie, and &s;ettling where they find mo&s;t Fodder for their Cattel.</P>
<P>Their Hor&s;es are courageous and &s;trong; but they never make u&s;e of them, unle&s;s it be in Battel, or when they run Races; &s;o that they never take care to &s;hooe them: for if at any time they cannot avoid pa&s;&s;ing through Stony and Rocky pa&s;&s;ages, they lead their Hor&s;es, riding them|&s;elves upon Mules. They are of various Colours, as our Hor&s;es are; bright Bay, Sorrel, cole Black, Roan, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but mo&s;t commonly Black. <HI>Elmacin</HI> reports, That <HI>Cyrtacus</HI> King of <HI>Nubia</HI> brought into <HI>Aegypt</HI> an Army of a Hundred thou|&s;and <HI>Blacks,</HI> all mounted upon Black Hor&s;es. <HI>Gregory</HI> piti|ed our Hor&s;es, when he &s;aw them drawing great Carts; admiring at the Patience of the Bea&s;ts: and our Cruelty, in putting &s;o Noble and Warlike a Creature to &s;uch ba&s;e and &s;ervile Exerci&s;es. And therefore the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ines</HI> make more frequent u&s;e of Mules, as well to carry their burthens, as when they travel long Journeys; for no &s;ort of Bea&s;t treads more &s;afely in their rugged ways: and for the greater ea&s;e of the Rider, they teach them &s;ometimes to Amble. It was very trouble&s;ome to <HI>Gregory</HI> when he travell'd, to ride a Hor&s;e|back; e&s;pecially, if the Hor&s;e either Trotted or Gallopp'd: a vexation which he frequently complained of.</P>
<P>Camels are never u&s;ed but in the plain Country, for they tread upon the Sand though &s;calding hot, without any harm to their Feet; but in Mountainous and Rocky ways, they are altogether u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>That &s;ame &s;ort of Sheep al&s;o, &s;o much admired and &s;o well known, both in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and in <HI>Africa,</HI> is here very common; the Tayls of which are &s;o fat and ponderous, that the lea&s;t of them weigh Ten and Twelve, the bigge&s;t of
<PB N="54" REF="37">
them &s;ometimes above forty Pound, &s;o that the Owners are forc'd to tye a little Cart behind them, wherein they put the Tayl of the Sheep, as well for the convenience of Carriage and to ea&s;e the poor Creature, as to pre&s;erve the Wooll from durt and na&s;tine&s;s, and being torn among bu&s;hes and &s;tones. And it is a probable conjecture that <HI>Exodus</HI> &s;peaks of this &s;ort of <HI>Ram,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Exod.</HI> 29.22</NOTE> where <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> commands, among the re&s;t of the fat parts of the <HI>Ram of Impletions</HI> that were to be cut off and burnt, the Tayl of the <HI>Ram <GAP DESC="foreign"> Aljah</HI> to be cut off for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; For that the Word <HI>Aljah</HI> &s;eems to import as much, which &s;igni|fies only the Tayl of a fat <HI>Ram,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Nahab</HI> being the ge|neral word for the Tayl of all other Bea&s;ts; among which, the leaner &s;ort of Sheep like ours are included.<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Bochart <HI>in</HI> Hierozoico. <HI>L.</HI> 2, <HI>c.</HI> 45. <HI>p.</HI> 494.</NOTE> As for other tame Bea&s;ts, they have the very &s;ame as are to be &s;een common in the&s;e parts of the World.</P>
<P>But as for Wild Bea&s;ts, <HI>Abi&s;&s;inia</HI> breeds more, and more bulkie than any other Region: of which, we &s;hall give a &s;hort account, beginning from tho&s;e which appear mo&s;t Mon&s;trous in their Creation. In the fir&s;t place <HI>Elephants,</HI> con&s;picuous for bulk of Body and Docility, heard together in the Plain and Woody places in great Numbers. <HI>H. Lo|dowic Azevedez</HI> &s;aw in <HI>Tigra</HI> a hundred of them together differing in Bigne&s;s; and he atte&s;ts, that as great a Num|ber went but a little before them.<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">This number may ea&s;ily be believed by them who &s;hall read <HI>Nenno&s;ies</HI> in Bibliothec. <HI>Photii.</HI> n. <HI>3.</HI> Where he writes of <HI>Elephants,</HI> no &s;mall Number near five thou&s;and.</NOTE> But it is almo&s;t incredi|ble to be told, what a havock they make in the Fields and Woods: they will &s;hake Trees bigger then them&s;elves in Bulk, &s;o long, till either their Trunks break, or the whole Tree be torn up by the Roots, as with an Earthquake. Smal|ler Trees they &s;nap off about a hands breadth from the Ground. As for &s;hrubs and underwoods, and all &s;orts of fruit Trees, they either eat 'em up, or trample 'em under their feet. <HI>Gregory</HI> was wont to &s;ay, That they open'd <HI>High ways,</HI> and where they had gone before, Travellers would rather choo&s;e to follow, as being le&s;s cumber&s;om. But lea&s;t Food &s;hould be wanting to &s;uch Ma&s;&s;ie Creatures, Providence has provided: For in tho&s;e Places there grow certain Trees about the bigne&s;s of Cherry-Trees, full of Pith, like Elder; upon which they ban|quet,
<PB N="55" REF="37">
as upon Gra&s;s. Of all the dumb Bea&s;ts, this Creature certainly &s;hares the mo&s;t of Human Under&s;tanding: kind u|&s;age excites their Ambition, contumely fires their Revenge. Of which many Examples are extant among the Writers of Na|tural Hi&s;torie. <HI>Gregory</HI> told us, that where they like their Entertainment, they are very punctual in ob&s;erving the Laws of Ho&s;pitality; though one of the Females would have &s;erv'd her Ho&s;t but an ugly trick after her departure from her Lodg|ing. This Elephant had brought forth a Young one, in a certain Field which her Landlord had &s;ow'd with Corn; who willing to di&s;lodge &s;uch an unwelcome Gue&s;t, had re&s;olv'd to kill the &s;aid Elephant: his Neighbours di&s;&s;uaded him, a&s;&s;ure|ing him, that the &s;laughter would not be unreveng'd; but on the other &s;ide, that &s;he would defend his ripe Harve&s;t again&s;t all others, and therefore advis'd him to let her alone, till &s;he had brought up her Cubb; but withal, &s;o &s;oon as &s;he had done that, forthwith to reap his Harve&s;t. The Husband|man following this Coun&s;el, pre&s;erv'd his Harve&s;t untouch'd, &s;uffering no other Injury than what the Bea&s;t &s;poil'd in her pa&s;&s;age to and fro. After the Female had carryed away her young ones from that Place, the Husbandman by the help of his Neighbours got in his Harve&s;t with all &s;peed. The next Night the Elephants came in Troops, with an intention to have Supp'd with their Landlord before their departure, but found the Table taken away, and the Buttery Empty. The People of the Country aver, that they are not their Teeth, but their Horns of which the Ivory is made; and indeed, their &s;ub&s;tance and &s;ituation demon&s;trate the &s;ame thing: for they grow out of the Head and not out of the Jaws: and be&s;ides that, they only adorn the brows of the Males; the Females like our Does have none at all. The Elephant ne|ver offers to attempt upon any per&s;on, unle&s;s provok'd; if he be threatn'd with &s;ticks or cudgels, he hides his <HI>Probo&s;ces</HI> under his Belly, and goes away braying; for he is &s;en&s;ible it may be ea&s;ily chop'd off: the extream parts of it being very nervous and tender, which cau&s;e him to be afraid of hard blows. At the end of it three little &s;harp pointed Langets come forth, by the help of which, he can take up the &s;malle&s;t thing that is, as men do with their fingers. They never take care to tame them here, where there is no u&s;e of them, either in Peace or War, among &s;o many high Mountains.</P>
<P>The next is, the <HI>Camelo-pardalis,</HI> or <HI>Panther-Camel,</HI> which is
<PB N="56" REF="38">
and bulkie as the Elephant, but far exceeds him in tallne&s;s. For this Bea&s;t is &s;o very high, that a man of a ju&s;t Statue, reaches but up to his knees, &s;o that it &s;eems very credible what is reported, That a Man on hor&s;eback &s;itting upright on his &s;addle, may ride under his Belly. He derives his Name from hence, that he has a long Head, and a long Neck like a Camel, but a Skin &s;potted all over like a Panther. The <HI>Romans,</HI> when they fir&s;t beheld this Bea&s;t, called it a <HI>Wild-Sheep,</HI> tho being more remarkable for its A&s;pect, then its Wild|ne&s;s, or Fiercene&s;s; as we read in <HI>Pliny.</HI> By the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ines,</HI> by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of his Tayl, he is call'd <HI>Jerataka|ein;</HI> that is, <HI>&s;lender Tayl:</HI> by the Italians <HI>Giraffa:</HI> from the Arabian word <HI>Zucaffa.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a Bea&s;t which is called <HI>Zecora,</HI> which for beau|ty exceeds all the Four-footed Creatures in the World. They of <HI>Congo</HI> give it the Name of <HI>Zebra.</HI> This Creature is about the bigne&s;s of a Mule, and is brought out of the Woods of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> and the Countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Galans,</HI> and ea|&s;ily tam'd. A pre&s;ent of great e&s;teem and frequently given to the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia. Tellez</HI> briefly de&s;cribes him thus, <HI>A Circle of a black Colour encompa&s;&s;es his Loyns like a girdle; adjoyning to which, Nature has pencill'd out &s;everal others, &s;ome broader &s;ome narrower, &s;ome black, and &s;ome of a bright &s;hining A&s;h-Colour; with &s;o much Elegancy and Order, as no Painters Art can equalize. His Eares are the only thing that disfigures him; being of a disproportionable length: for which rea&s;on he is called by the</HI> Portugals <HI>Burro do Matto, (though improperly) the wild A&s;s.</HI> But you may gue&s;s at his beauty, by his price.

The Fle&s;h of the Fowl whether new or &s;moak'd is made u&s;e of in Remedies again&s;t the biting of Serpents, which was found out by ob&s;erving how eagerly they devour them without harm. But Providence has not pro|vided one &s;ingle Enemy to their Serpents only.

And indeed, &s;ome of tho&s;e Birds &s;eem to be granted to Man for the Extirpating the Enemies of their well being, which becau&s;e they cannot vanqui&s;h them&s;elves, they betray to them that they think more able.

The Bird conducted them to a &s;hady Tree, about the boughs of which, a Mon&s;trous huge Snake had Curl'd her &s;elf; at the &s;ight whereof, he and his friend made more ha&s;t back again, than they did coming to &s;atisfie their Curio&s;ity.</HI> And indeed, it is not &s;afe to follow this Bird, unle&s;s a man be provided with all his Hunting In&s;tru|ments: neverthele&s;s, the Bird has her own ends in her dou|ble diligence too: for &s;he is &s;ure to have her &s;hare of the Slaughtered Carca&s;e whate're it be.

would. Of the <HI>Salamander, Gregory</HI> could tell me nothing; which of all Venomous Creatures, as <HI>Plinie</HI> reports, is ac|counted the mo&s;t Exqui&s;itely Mi&s;chievous.

Other &s;orts of Serpents commonly and generally known I forbear to mention. The vulgar &s;ort of People contemn 'em, walk among 'em, and kill 'em at their plea|&s;ure. Therefore as often as they go into the Country, they carry with them a croked &s;tick; for being &s;treight, it hits only with the Point; but being bent like a Bow, it &s;trikes with greater force and certainty. <HI>Gregory</HI> hearing there were a great many Serpents about <HI>Helburgh</HI> in <HI>Franconia,</HI> belonging
<PB N="67" REF="50">
to the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> provided him&s;elf with &s;uch a &s;ort of Weapon, and when he met a Snake, never &s;truck it upon the head, but upon the middle of the back; by which means, ha|ving di&s;abled the Serpent from creeping any further, he ea&s;ily kill'd it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e parts of <HI>Africa</HI> which are mo&s;t &s;ubject to heat, are mo&s;t Infe&s;ted with <HI>Serpents;</HI> which being for the &s;ame rea&s;on uncultivated, are therefore impa&s;&s;able. And therefore <HI>Gregory</HI> &s;eeing our Boots, &s;aid they were excellent defences again&s;t the Biting of <HI>Serpents.</HI> Sometimes they drive their Cattle, as I am apt to believe, fortified before-hand, by feeding upon the Plant <HI>A&s;&s;azoe,</HI> into the Fields and places that are &s;trew'd with <HI>Serpents</HI> Eggs, on purpo&s;e that they &s;hould trample 'em to pieces with their Hoofs: otherwi&s;e, they are &s;o Fruitful that they would encrea&s;e beyond Imagination.</P>
<P>But much more pernicious than the&s;e are the <HI>Locu&s;ts,</HI> which do not frequent the De&s;ert and Sandy places like the <HI>Serpents;</HI> but places be&s;t Manur'd, and Orchards mo&s;t laden with Fruit. They appear in Prodigious Multitudes, like a thick Cloud that ob&s;cures the Sun: nor Plants, nor Shrubs, nor Trees remain untouch'd: and where&s;oever they feed, their leavings &s;eem as it were parch'd with the Fire. Sometimes they enter the very Bark of the Trees, and then the Spring it &s;elf can|not repair the Damage. A general Mortality en&s;ues, and Re|gions lye wa&s;t for many years; in regard the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> never take care<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dapper</HI> in his De&s;cription of <HI>Guiny,</HI> or the <HI>Golden-&s;hoar, p. 459.</HI> but in this he is deceiv'd; becau&s;e he &s;ays, they came out of <HI>Arabia</HI> the Happy, &s;o far off.</NOTE> for Stores of Provi&s;ion, or to &s;tack their Hay. Indeed, for &s;ome time they may &s;upport them&s;elves by feed|ing upon the <HI>Locu&s;ts</HI> them&s;elves, which they greedily eat, as well to &s;atisfie their hunger as in Revenge; for it is a very &s;weet and whole&s;om &s;ort of Dyet: by means of which, a cer|tain <HI>Portuguez</HI> Garri&s;on in <HI>India,</HI> that was ready to yield for want of Provi&s;ion, held out till it was Relieved another way. And therefore it is not to be doubted, but that St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> fed upon the&s;e <HI>Locu&s;ts</HI> in the <HI>Wilderne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning other In&s;ects, of which that Climate is &s;uffi|ciently fruitful, it will be needle&s;s to &s;ay much more; on|ly as to their <HI>Bees,</HI> we have this to ob&s;erve; That they &s;warm in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> and produce Prodigious quantities of Honey: They are a &s;mall &s;ort of black Earthing-<HI>Bee,</HI> which make

the white&s;t and the &s;weete&s;t Honey that is u&s;ed in Medica|ments. From their Labours the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> gather their wild Honey, of the &s;ame nature with that which fed <HI>John the Bap|ti&s;t;</HI> but in regard they want Stings, they &s;eek for &s;ecurity in concealment; for they build their Architecture under Ground, into which the entrance is &s;o narrow, that upon the &s;ight of a man, five or &s;ix of them will fill it, and place their little heads equal with the ground &s;o like Arti&s;ts, as to delude the quicke&s;t &s;ight.</P>
<P>Next to the&s;e their <HI>Ants</HI> or <HI>Emmets</HI> are very remarkable; of which, there are likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;orts, not &s;o bigg as a &s;mall Dogg,<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">This I rather believe, than the &s;tory of <HI>Plinie,</HI> L. <HI>11. 9. 30.</HI> concerning <HI>Emmets</HI> among the Northern <HI>Indians,</HI> that dig up great pieces of Gold; them&s;elves as big as <HI>Egyptian Foxes.

They do not gather with indu&s;try, but pre&s;ently de|vour; and the pricks of their Stings are not a little painful. The next to the&s;e, are tho&s;e which by the Inhabitants are call'd, the <HI>Gundan</HI>'s Servants, being as it were Slaves to the Greater &s;ort; they march in Order, but carry their Provi&s;ion in the nippers of their little Snowts, and lay it up; when it is moi&s;t they bring it forth again and dry it in the Sun: of the&s;e, by rea&s;on of their great Indu&s;try, it is thought, that <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;pake.

They are mo&s;t Covetous after Learning, and de&s;irous of the knowledg of Arts and Sciences. Nor was there any other greater rea&s;on of that kindne&s;s which was &s;hewed to the Fathers of the Society to|wards the beginning of this Century, in <HI>Habes&s;inia,</HI> but that they were skilled in all &s;orts of Arts and Sciences, and there|fore admir'd by the King and Princes of the Nation. For they love and reverence all &s;orts of Forrain Chri&s;tians that are adorn'd with the Ornaments of Art and Learning. <HI>Gregory</HI> related to me, That when the <HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> Patriarch carried thi|ther a great number of very fair Books, &s;undry of the No|bility, and among the re&s;t, <HI>Tine,</HI> one of the King's Councel|lors, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with a Sigh in the&s;e words. <HI>Oh hap|py he that can under&s;tand all the&s;e Books!</HI> And many per&s;ons of full years, hearing of the excellency and large u&s;e of the
<PB N="71" REF="52">
Latine Language, have mo&s;t Ardently de&s;ired to learn it. And that indeed &s;eemed to me to be the mo&s;t prevailing rea|&s;on, why our <HI>Gregory</HI> though &s;tricken in years, undertook &s;o long a journey after me into <HI>Germany;</HI> and why <HI>Acalex</HI> a young <HI>Habe&s;&s;ine</HI> followed him &s;oon after; though not being under|&s;tood in <HI>Germany</HI> where he pronounced <HI>Ehrfaher</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Erfurt</HI> he had the ill fortune to lo&s;e his labour. Therefore they neither want ingenuity nor indu&s;try, but only Opportu|nity and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, for they never travel long Journies: our <HI>Europeans</HI> are hindred by the difficulties of getting into their Country, and the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Journey, whether by Land or Sea: and be&s;ides all this the Envy of the <HI>Turks</HI> joyn'd to their implacable Avarice will not permit them to &s;uffer us to Import our Arts of Peace and War, to their own and the di&s;advantage of the re&s;t of the <HI>Mahumetans.</HI> La&s;tly, their continual Civil Broyls, and Forraign Wars with the <HI>Gallans</HI> are &s;uch as will not allow the Nobility lei&s;ure to mind the Studies of Tranquillity.</P>
<P>But among &s;uch a variety of people, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that the &s;ame manners and di&s;po&s;itions &s;hould be in all; for Nature has brought forth nothing &s;o good in the Univer&s;e, which has not &s;omething of Evil mix'd with it.

In</HI> Gojam, &s;aith he, <HI>there are &s;ome Towns not far di&s;tant one from another, the</HI> Damotans, Gafatans, She|wans, Setans, Shatans, <HI>be&s;ides the</HI> Agawi, <HI>the</HI> Gonge, <HI>and the</HI> Natives, <HI>who&s;e Dialects differ as much as</HI> Portugueze <HI>from</HI> Itali|an <HI>or</HI> French: <HI>But the Nobility and Learneder &s;ort, as we make u&s;e of</HI> Latine, <HI>&s;o they &s;peak generally</HI> Amharic. That which follows, I had from <HI>Gregorie's</HI> Lips; by which the difference of their Language may be the better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The Language of <HI>Tigra</HI> comes the neare&s;t to our <HI>Ethiopic;</HI> as being lea&s;t corrupted of all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Amharic</HI> Language, tho&s;e of the Neighbouring Kingdoms come the neare&s;t; though their Dialects are diffe|rent one from another; for that of <HI>Bagemdra</HI> is peculiar: <HI>Angota, Hata, Gojam,</HI> and <HI>Shewa,</HI> u&s;e a Dialect common to one another.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t cruel and bloody War which the Inhabitants
<PB N="82" REF="58">
of <HI>Adela</HI> wag'd in the foregoing Century under the Conduct of their Captain<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French</HI> read the word <HI>Gragne,</HI> the <HI>Portuguezes Granhe.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Grainus,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines,</HI> &s;o ruin'd their Affairs, that they could never &s;ince recover their lo&s;&s;es. From whence, as well the <HI>Turks</HI> as the <HI>Gallans</HI> have taken an occa&s;ion continually to vex them with Wars and wa&s;tful In|roades. And fir&s;t, the <HI>Turks,</HI> after they had po&s;&s;e&s;t them|&s;elves of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and &s;lain the King of the <HI>Mamalukes,</HI> &s;ent a Fleet into the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to &s;ecure the <HI>Indian</HI> Navigation, which is va&s;tly profitable to <HI>Egypt:</HI> for that the <HI>Portugue&s;&s;es,</HI> to the intent they might enjoy the &s;ole Trade of <HI>India,</HI> took all the Ships of the <HI>Saracens</HI> they could meet with, pretending a hatred of their Religion. The <HI>Turks</HI> therefore to &s;hut up all the Ports of that Sea, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Sua|qena,</HI> and <HI>Matzua,</HI> I&s;lands that formerly belong'd to the <HI>Ha|be&s;&s;ines,</HI> which they might the more ea&s;ily do, in regard the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> having their handsful by Land, took no care of their Sea Affairs. But &s;oon after they became &s;en&s;ible, how va&s;t an Inconvenience it was to have &s;o Powerful a Neigh|bour; finding what Potent Succours of Men and Fire-arms the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Enemies and tho&s;e that revolted from them. Nor are they le&s;s frequently &s;en&s;ible of it to this day; in regard that neither Men nor Merchandize can be admitted into the <HI>Gulph,</HI> unle&s;s they reque&s;t it from the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> or his Deputies, with va&s;t Expen&s;es of rich Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>But the Fiercene&s;s and Cruelty of the <HI>Gallans</HI> is much more Formidable. For they having Subdu'd many Kingdoms &amp; Pro|vinces thir&s;t after all the re&s;t; whence 'tis very probable what <HI>Tellezius</HI> writes, That unle&s;s they had fallen into Factions among them&s;elves; or that the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> were not &s;o Invin|cibly &s;ecur'd within their own Rocks, they had been e're this utterly de&s;troy'd. Therefore it &s;eems but requi&s;ite, that I &s;hould here give an Accompt of the Original and Cu&s;toms of the&s;e People: which I &s;hall do as well from <HI>Tellezius,</HI> as from the Lips of our <HI>Gregory</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What time <HI>Etana-Denghel,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>David</HI> was entangled in that fatal War with the <HI>Adelen&s;es;</HI> that other Plague brake forth about the Year One thou&s;and five hundred thirty &s;even, from the Kingdom of <HI>Bali.</HI> A certain number of Ser|vants being cruelly handl'd by one <HI>Matthew</HI> a Noble-man,

Revolted; and de&s;pairing of Pardon, a&s;&s;ociated to them&s;elves all the Fugitives and Criminals that fled from the Puni&s;hment of their Mi&s;-deeds, and liv'd upon Publick Spoil and Plunder, which they did with more &s;ucce&s;s, in regard the Inhabitants of <HI>Bali</HI> were not able to oppo&s;e 'em: And for the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines,</HI> they being involv'd in Wars with the <HI>Adelans,</HI> contemn'd tho&s;e incon&s;iderable Robbers. <HI>Tellez</HI> affirms them a particu|lar Nation, and the &s;ame that Inhabited the <HI>Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Places adjoyning to the <HI>Indian Sea:</HI> perhaps tho&s;e Servants, of whom <HI>Gregory</HI> makes mention, belong'd to that Neighbouring Nation, and flying to their own Coun|try-men for Aid, di&s;cover'd <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> and tho&s;e Countries which were by their Servitude well known to them.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>Gallans,</HI> puft up with their &s;ucce&s;s and rich Plunder, and increas'd in their number, having Subdu'd <HI>Bali,</HI> over-ran the neighbouring Kingdoms; But when they &s;aw that what was won by Force mu&s;t be defended by Force, they began to make Laws among them&s;elves, very advanta|geous for the Enlargement of their dete&s;table Dominion, and the pre&s;ervation of their untam'd and barbarous fierce|ne&s;s. They are not &s;o unlimited, as to de&s;pi&s;e Matrimo|ny, like the <HI>Garamants,</HI> nor do they live commonly with their Women; but they have as many Wives as they plea&s;e. The young Men are not permitted to cut their Hair, before they have kill'd an Enemy in the Field, or &s;ome wild Bea&s;t, an encouragement of boldne&s;s and hardine&s;s to adventure; that by &s;uch a con&s;picuous Mark, the &s;luggi&s;h and cow-hearted &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed, from the bold and da|ring. . In their Banquets and Fea&s;ts the be&s;t Bit is alway &s;et in the middle, and he that takes it, mu&s;t be the fir&s;t in any Perilous undertaking: nor is there any long con&s;ideration: every one prepares to win that Honour to him&s;elf, Ambi|tion &s;timulating their Fortitude: but then there is a nece&s;&s;ity of bringing &s;ome proof of an Enemy Slain, fir&s;t they bring the Head, as the mo&s;t mode&s;t part of the Body; but if there be any doubt of the Sex for want of a Beard, they cut off the mo&s;t Ob&s;cene Parts of the Slain; a thing foul to relate: the&s;e they number, and heap up before the Army, as if their barbarous Fortitude could not be made appear without &s;uch kind of Te&s;timony. However by tho&s;e parts it is not ma|nife&s;t, whether he be a Friend or an Enemy that is Slain, and therefore the Head decides that Que&s;tion. But their mo&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="59">
prevailing encouragement in Battle is, that becau&s;e no man &s;hould be thought to Fight for ba&s;e hire, or out of &s;ervile Obedience for another man's honour, but only for his own Reputation, the Plunder is equally divided among them all. They go to War, as if they had devoted them&s;elves for Victo|ry, with a certain Re&s;olution, either to Overcome or Dye: from whence proceeds great ob&s;tinacy in Combat. They u&s;e but few Weapons, at a di&s;tance they fight with Lances or Darts; hand to hand with Clubs or Stakes burnt at the end; relying more upon their Courage, than their Hands: They make their Shield of the skins of Oxen, or wild <HI>Bu|falo's;</HI> formerly they fought for the mo&s;t part afoot, now more frequently a Hor&s;e-back. And though the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines</HI> are generally more in Number, and better Arm'd, as al&s;o more skilful Hor&s;e-men, yet are they not able to with&s;tand the vi|olence of their furious On&s;ets. But how they may be Sub|du'd we &s;hall then declare, when we come to the Chap|ter concerning the Power of the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia.</HI></P>
<P>Being thus bred up to War, they abhor all peaceful Cal|lings, believing it much better to ravi&s;h wealth, then get it by hone&s;t Labour; they willingly eat the Bread which they find among the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines,</HI> but do not love to grind the Corn; for they neither till nor &s;ow their Lands, never minding Agriculture, but only grazing of Cattle: their Herds they drive before 'em, as well in War as in Peace, through the mo&s;t fertile Pa&s;tures; upon the raw Fle&s;h of which they ge|nerally feed without Bread, and then drink their Milk; u&s;ing the &s;ame &s;ort of Food and Drink, both at home and in the field.</P>
<P>They never cumber them&s;elves with any Baggage, not &s;o much as Kitchin Uten&s;ils, only wooden Cups to drink their Milk in. Such wild Nations are generally a Terror to ci|viliz'd People, whom Aboundance renders &s;lothful, and Riches effeminate. Thus the <HI>Cimbrians, Goths, Vandals,</HI> and <HI>Normans</HI> over-ran the more civiliz'd Kingdoms of <HI>Europe.</HI> Thus the <HI>Oriental Tartars</HI> formerly Invaded <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Gallans,</HI> if at any time overcome by the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines,</HI> retire with their Herds into remote Corners; Oppo&s;ing only wild De|&s;erts, and Solitudes for their Enemies to Encounter. Every Eight Years they chu&s;e one among&s;t them for their Leader, as it were a kind of Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, whom they call <HI>Luva;</HI> and him all the re&s;t of the Captains obey; but that

is only in time of War: his fir&s;t Enterprize is, to Mu&s;ter the People together, and Invade <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> for the &s;ake of Ho|nour and Bootie.</P>
<P>They have a Language peculiar to them&s;elves, and diffe|rent from all the re&s;t of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;inian</HI> Dialects; which argues their Original both forrain and common to all their Tribes; they admit of Circumci&s;ion among them&s;elves, whe|ther it be by any ancient Cu&s;tom, ob&s;erved by many of the Neighbouring <HI>Ethnics,</HI> or for that they find the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines</HI> to do the &s;ame.</P>
<P>They have no Idols, and but very little Divine Wor&s;hip. If you ask them concerning God, or any Supreme <HI>Numen,</HI> or who it is that Governs the Earth with &s;o much Order and Con&s;tancy? they an&s;wer, <HI>Heaven,</HI> which embraces in their view, all the re&s;t; however they adore that <HI>Heaven</HI> with no Solemn Wor&s;hip, more barbarous than the <HI>Barbari|ans</HI> them&s;elves: nor yet are they altogether void of Huma|nity, for they a&s;pire to a large &s;hare of Ingenuity, and in aptne&s;s to learn equalize the &s;marte&s;t of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines.</HI> From whence we may ob&s;erve, that there is no &s;ort of Human|kind &s;o fierce and &s;avage which may not be civiliz'd by Education and Learning. Many have &s;ubmitted to the In&s;tructions of Chri&s;tianity, and per&s;i&s;ted con&s;tant in the Faith. <HI>Tellezius</HI> te&s;tifies, and <HI>Gregory</HI> farther witne&s;&s;ed, That &s;everal Thou&s;ands of the <HI>Gallans</HI> were Converted to the Chri&s;tian Religion, and &s;ubmitted to Bapti&s;m under King <HI>Ba&s;ilides.</HI> Now let me tell you, this is that formidable Na|tion which has ruin'd the Power and Dominion of the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines;</HI> in&s;omuch, that they have torn from the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ine</HI> King above the half of tho&s;e Territories which his Ance&s;tors en|joy'd; for after their Irruption out of <HI>Bali,</HI> they made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Provinces of <HI>Gedmam, Angota, Dawara, Wed, Fatagar, Ifat, Guragea, Ganza, Conta, Damota, Waleka, Bizama,</HI> part of <HI>Shewa,</HI> and many intermix'd Kingdoms. Nor had they &s;topp'd there, had they not, being rent into Divi&s;ions among them&s;elves, turn'd their Arms one again&s;t another, and given the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> a little breathing time: for Concord among Equals rarely long attends Pro&s;perity. At this time they are divided into certain Tribes, (Seventy or more,) and as it were into Two Nations; of which the more <HI>We&s;terly</HI> are by the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> call'd <HI>Bertuma Galla,</HI> tho&s;e that lye to the <HI>Ea&s;t, Boren Galla:</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Ea&s;terly</HI> and <HI>Sou|therly,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="60">
in a manner encircle <HI>Haba&s;&s;ia,</HI> and harra&s;e it with fre|quent Incur&s;ions. They have al&s;o &s;eparated <HI>Cambata</HI> and <HI>Enarea</HI> from the re&s;t of the Body, as having &s;ubdu'd the Kingdoms that lye between; which makes it very difficult for the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ine</HI> Prince to convoy home the Tribute of tho&s;e Kingdoms. Thus there is a nece&s;&s;ity for the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> to be always in War with the&s;e People; nor is there any hopes of regaining their ancient and pri&s;tine Glory, unle&s;s that Nation be fir&s;t reduc'd into order. The King has prudently made u&s;e of their Inte&s;tine Di&s;cords; for he has plac'd the Revol|ters in <HI>Dembea</HI> and <HI>Gojam,</HI> and &s;ucce&s;sfully makes u&s;e of their Arms again&s;t their Country-men: for as they are the mo&s;t excellent Antidotes, which are compos'd of the mo&s;t Veno|mous Animals them&s;elves; &s;o the <HI>Barbarians</HI> them&s;elves are the mo&s;t prevalent Force again&s;t the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us take a view of the Kingdom of <HI>Zandero,</HI> till lately undi&s;covered, although contiguous to <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> as be|ing not above four or five days from it. The Inhabitants are but little more civil than the <HI>Gallans,</HI> only that they ac|knowledge a King, and have an awful re&s;pect for &s;omething, whether it be God or Devil. The King being dead, the next of Kin retire into the Wood, and there mode&s;tly wait the Election of the Nobility, who in que&s;t of their King newly Elected among them&s;elves, enter the Wood, guided by a certain Bird, of the <HI>Eagle</HI>-kind, which by the Noi&s;e it makes di&s;covers the Conceal'd Per&s;on: pre&s;ently they find him &s;urrounded with a Guard of Lyons, Dragons, and Pan|thers, <HI>(d)</HI> a&s;&s;embled together by a &s;ort of Incantation to the Ancients unknown: At fir&s;t he makes a re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Electors, and wounds tho&s;e that he can, that he may &s;eem to be Con&s;trained to take the Government upon him: &s;oon after, as they are going along, another Gang, to whom it be|longs of ancient Cu&s;tom, endeavour to Re&s;cue their King from the other Party, claiming to them&s;elves the Honour of being the Per&s;ons that &s;et the Crown upon the King's Head, and purcha&s;ing the hopes of Royal Favour, by means of a &s;eeming Sport, which oft-times proves very Bloody. <HI>Thus in&s;tead of Inauguration, the</HI> African <HI>Gentiles think it Lawful to attone the Devil with human Blood.</HI> The King proud in the height of Poverty, not contented with the few &s;teps to his Throne, gets upon the Beam of his Hou&s;e, from whence he looks down, as from a Gallery, and gives An&s;wers to

<HI>John</HI> the Second pur&s;uing, to bring the Di&s;covery to Perfecti|on, &s;ent two <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> Skilful in the Arabic Language, <HI>Peter Covillian,</HI> and <HI>Alphon&s;us Payva,</HI> to try what they could do; among other things, giving them more e&s;pecially in charge, to find out that &s;o much celebrated <HI>Presbyter John,</HI> that mo&s;t wealthy King as he was reputed, either in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> or <HI>India,</HI> hoping ea&s;ily to obtain a League and Friend&s;hip with him, as a Chri|&s;tian Prince. They Travell'd through <HI>Egypt</HI> &s;everal ways in|to <HI>India,</HI> and after a long and vain Search for <HI>Pre&s;ter John, Pay|va</HI> came home; but <HI>Peter</HI> more inqui&s;itive, at length in &s;ome of the Ports of the Red Sea, heard much talk of a mo&s;t Potent Chri&s;tian King of the <HI>Abe&s;sines,</HI> that us'd to carry a Cro&s;s in his Hands; as al&s;o of his Subjects, who were great Favourers if not Followers of the Chri&s;tian Religion. Believing it therefore to be of little moment whether this famous Mo|narch liv'd in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> or in <HI>Africa,</HI> he certainly per&s;waded him&s;elf, as being Ignorant both in Hi&s;tory and Geography that this was the Prince &s;o much &s;ought after; and there|upon gave Intelligence thereof to his own King, while he him&s;elf continu'd his Journey into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> with a re&s;olu|tion to take a view of this Celebrated <HI>Presbyter</HI> Emperor, who was look't upon as another Pope. The&s;e glad Tidings the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;ooner believ'd, than con&s;ider'd; and &s;o &s;pread the News all over <HI>Europe</HI> for real Truth; Credulity gaining ea&s;ily upon tho&s;e that are ignorant of Foreign Affairs and Kingdoms.

<P>We find among the mo&s;t Eminent Hi&s;torians, that for|merly there was a certain Chri&s;tian Prince, that reign'd in the utmo&s;t Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> not far from the Kingdom of <HI>Tenduc</HI> toward<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">The mo&s;t Skilful Geographers teach us, That <HI>Cataya</HI> is no peculiar Kingdom, but a Part of North <HI>China.</HI> See <HI>Newho&s;tus</HI>'s China Emba&s;&s;y.</NOTE> <HI>Cataya;</HI> who being of great Power and Fame, was by the Neighbouring <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> to &s;ignifie his remar|kable Sanctity, call'd <HI>Pre&s;ter-Chan,</HI> or Prince of the Adorers; that is to &s;ay, Chri&s;tians; or as <HI>Scaliger</HI> will have it, <HI>Fri&s;te|giani,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tolic</HI> Prince.

Neither &s;hall we derogate in the lea&s;t from his Title, as being &s;o highly Eminent above all the Barbarous Kings of <HI>Africa,</HI> both for his Power, and the Honour of being a Chri&s;tian.

However they do not ca&s;t it quite off, as the Popes do, but a&s;&s;ume both together. Thus <HI>Zar-a-Jacob</HI> in an Epi&s;tle to the Tome of Councils, writes him&s;elf <HI>Zar-a-Jacob,</HI> and our <HI>Imperial,</HI> or <HI>Inaugura|tion</HI> Name <HI>Con&s;tantine.</HI> This Name de&s;ign'd for a good Omen, generally &s;ignifies Reverence and Veneration, as <HI>Atznaf-Saghed;</HI> Venerable to the Ends of the Earth; <HI>Melec-Saghed,</HI> a venerable Ruler. Sometimes they take the Names of Gems; as <HI>Adamas-Saghed,</HI> the venerable Diamond. <HI>Encua-Saghed,</HI> or <HI>Wanag-Saghed,</HI> a Precious Gemm. This was the
<PB N="105" REF="64">
Name of <HI>David,</HI> the Son of <HI>Naod,</HI> the Father of <HI>Claudius.</HI> Whence I believe it came to pa&s;s, that his Emba&s;&s;ador <HI>Tzaga|zaabus,</HI> being &s;ent into <HI>Portugal,</HI> call'd him <HI>Pretious John,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Prete-Gianni,</HI> as judging that the Per&s;on could not but be precious, that bare the Name of a Precious Gem. Sometimes &s;everal Names, and tho&s;e variou&s;ly pronounc'd are clapp'd together. For that &s;ame <HI>David,</HI> be&s;ides the two Names already mention'd, was Baptiz'd <HI>Etana Denghel, The Virgins Incen&s;e;</HI> or as others will have it, <HI>Lebna Denghel,</HI> The Virgins <HI>Storax.</HI> But this multitude and variety of Names often renders the Hi&s;tory imperfect, while many times that is &s;poken of many Per&s;ons, which &s;hould be only &s;aid of one.

<P>The King's Seal which they u&s;e in Sealing their Letters, is a Lion holding a Cro&s;s, with this Motto: <HI>The Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Juda <HI>has won.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE find in Sacred Writt (that we may begin at the Fountain of <HI>Antiquity</HI>) that the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> came to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to hear and behold the Wi&s;dom of <HI>Salo|mon,</HI> and that &s;he brought along with her, precious Gifts, as Gemms, Gold, and Spices.

<P>Her therefore the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> a&s;&s;ert to be their Queen; and have her Hi&s;tory written at large, but mix'd with &s;undry Fa|bles. We &s;hall tran&s;cribe the Summ of it out of <HI>Tellez,</HI> who &s;aith, <HI>That the Queen of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>Maqueda,</HI> under&s;tanding from her Merchant <HI>Tamerin</HI> the certainty of the Report which had bin &s;pread abroad concerning the great Power and Wis|dom of <HI>Salomon,</HI> with a great train of her Nobility, and Royal

pre&s;ents gave him an Interview at his own Court; where &s;he learnt from him the true Wor&s;hip of God: And at her return, after a certain &s;pace of time &s;he brought forth her Son <HI>Menilehec</HI> begot by <HI>Salomon,</HI> and whom he had nam'd <HI>David.</HI> This young Prince was afterwards &s;ent to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to his Father, where by his order and care he was Exactly in&s;truct|ed in the Law of God. Being grown up, he was anointed King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and &s;ent back into his own Kingdom, ac|company'd with &s;everal noble <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> and Doctors of the Law, who were joyn'd with him, as Friends and Compani|ons, and Mini&s;ters of State; among the re&s;t went al&s;o <HI>Aza|ria,</HI> the Son of <HI>Zadoc</HI> the High Prie&s;t. And this is that Prince from whom all the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Kings and the chiefe&s;t of the Nobility derive their Pedegrees to this day.</P>
<P>But then follows a Tale no le&s;s in&s;ipid, then misbecoming the new King. <HI>That the&s;e noble Jews, nefariou&s;ly and Sacrilegiou&s;ly took away with them the Ark of the Covenant, together with the Tables of the Ten Commandements, the Temple being carele&s;ly lookt after, and the Gates being left open as it were by the Providence of God.</HI> Pre|&s;ently the Mother, upon his return, re&s;ign'd her Kingdom to her Son <HI>David,</HI> obliging him and all the Nobility of the Na|tion, That they &s;hould never for the future admit a Woman to rule over them; but onely males of the Line of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>But it has bin the Long and Serious Enquiry of the An|cients, of what Countrey and of what Progenie this &s;ame Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> was. <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> while he writes the Antiqui|ties of the <HI>Jews,</HI> an Author not to be contemn'd; tho in For|raign matters not &s;o well vers'd, affirms her to be one <HI>Ni|caule,</HI> mentioned hy <HI>Herodotus.</HI> And yet in the Modern Edi|tions of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> there is no &s;uch Name to be found, unle&s;s &s;he &s;hould be the &s;ame whom he calls <HI>Nitocris.</HI> That <HI>Nicaule,</HI> according to <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> was not onely Queen of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but of <HI>Egypt;</HI> in which 'tis to be fear'd he is foully mi&s;taken. However, that &s;he came out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> many of the An|cients agree, as <HI>Origen, Au&s;tin,</HI> and <HI>An&s;elm,</HI> whom Cardinal <HI>Toletus Cites.</HI> Others on the contrary, declare her to have come out of <HI>Arabia,</HI> as <HI>Ju&s;tin, Cyprian, Epiphanius, Cyril, Alexan|drinus,</HI> Cardinal <HI>Baronius, Suarez, Lorinus,</HI> and at large <HI>Pineda</HI> in his Treati&s;e of the Acts of <HI>Salomon;</HI> where he labours by ten Rea&s;ons to confirm his Opinion. Of which, tho&s;e that &s;eem to carry mo&s;t weight are the&s;e: <HI>That</HI> Saba <HI>is &s;eated in</HI> Arabia <HI>to the South of</HI> Judea. <HI>That Camels, Spice, Gemms and
<PB N="160" REF="67">
Gold are more con&s;i&s;tent with</HI> Arabia <HI>than with</HI> Ethiopia. But the&s;e different Opinions are ea&s;ily reconcil'd; if as many of the Old Writers held, the ancient <HI>Ethiopia</HI> extended it &s;elf into <HI>Arabia.</HI> For they a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Homerites</HI> to have bin Nations of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> which without que&s;tion were formerly &s;eated in <HI>Arabia the Happy.</HI> That Region which the <HI>Hebrews</HI> call by the Name, of <HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> by the 70 Interpreters is rendred <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> From hence <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> cho&s;e his Wife, who is call'd the <HI>Ethiope&s;s;</HI> and yet that County is a part of <HI>Arabia,</HI> according to the Common acceptation now a days, whence the <HI>Arabians</HI> are call'd <HI>Cu&s;hites.</HI> Therefore was the <HI>Ethiopia</HI> of the Ancients two-fold, <HI>A&s;iatic</HI> and <HI>African,</HI> or Oriental and We&s;tern. For the Ancients did not limit the principal Parts of the World as we do now; while they extended <HI>India</HI> into <HI>Africa,</HI> and brought <HI>Ethiopia</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and believed that the <HI>Indians</HI> inha|bited beyond the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> Nor did they think that <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> were di&s;tinct parts of the Orbe of the Earth, but onely particular Regions. <HI>Egypt</HI> &s;eemed to belong &s;ome|times to <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> &s;ometimes to <HI>Africa;</HI> and others made <HI>Nilus,</HI> to be the bounds between tho&s;e two Continents. And, which is mo&s;t remarkable, the Antient <HI>Arabia</HI> was not of &s;o large an Extent, as now the Modern is. For the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Home|rites</HI> were plac'd beyond the Limits of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph was al&s;o taken onely for a part or Bay of the Red Sea. All which things the Geographers of later Times have much more di&s;tinctly reform'd. So that altho by Us, the <HI>Sa|beans</HI> are accounted to be a Region of the Southern <HI>Arabia</HI> that lyes upon the <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean, and con&s;equently toward the utmo&s;t Limits of Land there, yet may the Queen of <HI>Sheba,</HI> according to the Opinion of the Ancients, be &s;aid to come out of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Nor does it argue any thing of ab&s;urdity to con|jecture that &s;he might at the &s;ame time command that part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> which lay upon the Oppo&s;ite Shore, and at &s;o near a di&s;tance.</P>

So that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> &s;eem'd to him to be a certain live|ly repre&s;entation of the Ancient Hebrew Government.

Tellezi|us,</HI> none of the milde&s;t Cen&s;urers of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Traditions, in this thing, agrees throughout with the Patriarch, adding, That it ought to &s;eem &s;trange to no Per&s;on, that <HI>Salomon,</HI> who took to wife the Daughter of <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> and al&s;o lov'd the <HI>Mo|abiti&s;h, Idumean, Sidonian</HI> and <HI>Hethic</HI> Women, &s;hould de&s;ire to ta&s;t the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Variety. The <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> al&s;o call'd the Po|&s;terity of their Kings <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> neither do they think any other per&s;ons worthy of the Scepter but the Male I&s;&s;ue of <HI>Menilehec;</HI> who for that rea&s;on bear the Lyon in their Royal Coats, with this Impre&s;e, <HI>The Lyon of the Tribe of</HI> Judah <HI>has overcome:</HI> to demon&s;trate that they are de&s;cended from the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and the Line of <HI>David:</HI> nor that <HI>Candaces</HI> Eu|nuch learnt the Orthodox Religion from any other then from the <HI>I&s;raelites. Gregory</HI> al&s;o averr'd to me the &s;ame things, and that the Book wherein tho&s;e things were record|ed, was call'd the <HI>Glory of the Kings,</HI> and was of great autho|rity among them; and that no per&s;on in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> doubted of the Truth thereof.

However, I do not think it con|venient,
<PB N="162" REF="68">
to augment or le&s;&s;en the Credit of the&s;e things, un|till tho&s;e <HI>Ethiopic</HI> In&s;titutions, Offices, Cu&s;toms and Manners, of which the Patriarch &s;peaks in general, &s;hall be more parti|cularly made known to me; that I &s;ee the Genealogies of tho&s;e public Mini&s;ters, whom <HI>Gregory</HI> mentions; and that I hear the an&s;wers to &s;uch doubts as I &s;hall propo&s;e. I find in|deed the Con&s;ent of the Nation, and the affirmation of their Kings; for <HI>Claudius</HI> calls his Ance&s;tors <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h Kings:</HI> and at the time of Inauguration, they proclaim the Creation of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h King:</HI> and they who are kept in the Rock <HI>Ge&s;hen,</HI> bear the Name of <HI>I&s;raelites:</HI> And la&s;tly, I find &s;ome Rites and Cu&s;toms agreeing with tho&s;e of the <HI>Jews.</HI> Nor is it any wonder to me more than to <HI>Tellezius,</HI> or di&s;agreeable from <HI>Salomon</HI>'s practice, that after &s;o many profound and knotty Riddles unloos'd, he &s;hould unty the Queen of <HI>Sheba's</HI> Mar|riage Girdle. Again, if the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> are Colonies of the <HI>Sabeans</HI> and <HI>Homerites,</HI> it may as well be granted that the <HI>Queen of the South</HI> deriv'd her Pedigree from them. Yet there are many things that &s;eem to per&s;wade the contrary. For as to the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h Rites,</HI> we &s;hall hereafter &s;hew, that they might have bin introduc'd long after <HI>Salomon</HI>'s time upon other grounds; and that they were common as well to the Gentiles as to the Chri&s;tians. For if the true Wor&s;hip of God began from that time, how came it to be pre&s;erv'd without Synagogues, and the Sacred Volumes? But they have them not, either in the Hebrew Language, nor tran&s;lated into their own. Nor does the Appellation of <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h Kings,</HI> argue the Verity of their De&s;cent, no more than if any one &s;hould a&s;&s;ert our Emperours de&s;cended from the Ancient <HI>Romans.</HI> But if, as the Po&s;terity of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> they continue in their Offices, or are &s;o &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve their Po&s;terity; why not as well in pre&s;erving the Hi&s;tories of their Ance&s;tors? and in perpetuating Kindne&s;&s;es between their Relations and tho&s;e of the &s;ame Tribe or Family? why not more choice in their Marriages? more earne&s;t in Vi&s;iting the Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem?</HI> and in giving mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their Brethren? E&s;pecially when <HI>Rehoboam</HI> the Brother of <HI>Menehelec,</HI> &s;uffer'd that great Lo&s;s of the revolt of the Ten Tribes? and when he was in|vaded by <HI>Si&s;ack</HI> King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> whom no man better than the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> could have diverted? when the <HI>Jews</HI> were oppre&s;s'd by &s;o many Enemies; when they were carry'd away Captive to <HI>Babylon?</HI> when ruin'd by the Kings of <HI>A&s;&s;yria?</HI> and

when &s;ubdu'd by the <HI>Romans?</HI> For then the Pa&s;&s;ages were free thorough <HI>Arabia</HI> or <HI>Egypt;</HI> and the <HI>Red Sea</HI> was open.

For Learning and Religion generally go together, as may be prov'd by the Examples of many Nations.

Queen <HI>Makeda.</HI> Then, &s;aith he, four and twenty Kings &s;ucceeded, till <HI>Bazen</HI> reign'd; and yet in the next Chapter, writes him to be the Twentieth from <HI>Menihelec</HI> the Son of <HI>Salomon:</HI> but neither does he name them, neither will we de|tain the Reader amid&s;t the&s;e uncertainties.</P>
<P>There is le&s;s doubt, that Chri&s;t our Saviour was born in the time of <HI>Bazen,</HI> more particularly in the Eighteenth Year of his Reign.

After <HI>Bazen,</HI> for the &s;pace of 327 Years <HI>Ethiopia</HI> was govern'd by Thirteen Kings, as <HI>Tellezius</HI> records it. But he mentions not one of their names, perhaps becau&s;e he found there was nothing of certainty. From the time that<NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">Abreha is an <HI>Arabic</HI> word, contractedly &s;poken. <HI>Abra:</HI> Erroneou&s;ly taken for <HI>Abraham,</HI> which they pronounce <HI>Ibrahim.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Abreha,</HI> and <HI>Atzbeha</HI> held the Scepter, the Ethiopic Hi&s;tory has afforded much more clearne&s;s and light, and the names of the Kings are more certainly recited.

The Greek and Latin Authors call him <HI>Eles baan:</HI> Perhaps from the Ethiopic name of Bapti&s;me, <HI>Atzbeha,</HI> with the Arabic article <HI>El.

The Kings of this Line are very enviou&s;ly traduc'd by <HI>Telle|zius</HI> as unju&s;t, and unworthy to be remember'd; tho it has honour'd <HI>Ethiopia</HI> with many Renowned Monarchs: of whom there is &s;till a happy Memorial both in the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Li|turgy,

<P>In the mean time the Enemies of the new Religion Ren|devouz'd together from all Parts; and among the re&s;t <HI>Abuna Peter,</HI> the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Metropolitan, and chief Head of the Rebellion; who by an unheard of Pre&s;ident in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> con|trary to the Laws of God and Man, ab&s;olv'd the Rebels from the tye of their Oaths which they had Sworn to their lawful Prince, which they them&s;elves had already broke, by virtue of a dete&s;table Excommunication of his Prince. Thus more and more embold'nd, and contemning the Maje&s;ty of the King, they turn'd their Veneration into Hatred. And &s;o with mutual Animo&s;ity they joyn Battel. The <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> who fought in the right wing, maintain'd their ground a long time, believing the Kings and the Cau&s;e of Re|ligion to be their own. But in the left Wing, of which the King him&s;elf took charge, all things went to rack; for ma|ny fled over to the Enemy, many look'd on without &s;triking a &s;troke, re&s;olv'd to follow the Fortune of the Day. Thus the King for&s;aken by his own, fought bravely for a long time, till <HI>Laeca-Marjam,</HI> and the re&s;t of his Guard being &s;lain, he was him&s;elf &s;truck down from his Hor&s;e with the &s;ling of a Lance. After that getting up again to renew the Fight, he was &s;tuck through the body, and &s;lain with &s;everal Darts thrown at a di&s;tance; reverence of his per&s;on not permitting them to come near to hurt him. The third day after the Fight, he was taken up and buried without any Funeral Pomp in a little Chappel hard by the Field of the Battel. Such was the end of the &s;hort Life and Reign of this Fa|mous and Lawful King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> A doleful Warning to admoni&s;h us, that the Cau&s;e of Religion ought to be mode|rately and prudently handled. And that it behoves a Prince

</ARGUMENT>
<P>KIng <HI>Zadenghel</HI> being thus &s;lain, the War indeed ceas'd, yet Peace did not pre&s;ently en&s;ue. For the Rebels not dreaming of &s;uch a &s;peedy Victory, had not con&s;ider'd of a Succe&s;&s;or. Wherefore, as it were &s;tupid with Emulation, <HI>Ras-Athana&s;ius</HI> departs for <HI>Gojam,</HI> and <HI>Za&s;lac</HI> for <HI>Dembea,</HI> with|out ever holding any common Con&s;ultation. Thereupon <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> hearing of the King's death, and believing that the Kingdom was now fallen to Him, as being the Son of <HI>Ba&s;i|lides,</HI> the Nephew of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and Grandchild of <HI>David;</HI> and then being al&s;o a Young man, train'd up in the <HI>Gallan</HI> Wars, belov'd and &s;urrounded with the choice&s;t of the Military Bands, he conceiv'd no &s;mall hopes of his de&s;ign. Fir&s;t there|fore he &s;ends before one of the Faithfulle&s;t of his Friends to <HI>Ras-Athana&s;ius,</HI> with in&s;tructions to declare to him in &s;hort, <HI>That whereas the Kingdom belong'd to him by right of Inheritance, he &s;hould come pre&s;ently and joyn Forces with his.</HI> In the mean time, <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> not expecting an An&s;wer, follows the Me&s;&s;enger with the nimble&s;t of his Army, and writes to <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> as if
<PB N="184" REF="79">
already made King, <HI>That he was at hand, and that therefore he &s;hould come to meet him and pay him the accustom'd honours due to him. Athana&s;ius</HI> amaz'd at the unexpected approach of <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> void of Coun&s;el, the Danger being Equal on both &s;ides, either to refu&s;e or admit him, at length, finding all a&s;&s;i&s;tance far di|&s;tant, and no hopes of delay, to give him time to con&s;ult with <HI>Zaslac,</HI> he rather cho&s;e to be before-hand with the new King's Favours, than to hazard the uncertain Fortune of a Battel. So that <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> being honourably receiv'd into the Camp, was &s;aluted <HI>King.</HI> Which done, he pre&s;ently writes to <HI>Za&s;lac, That by the Providence of God he had recovered the Throne of his Ance&s;tors; and was now marching for</HI> Dembea: <HI>therefore he &s;hould take Care that there might be Forces there ready to receive him, and tho&s;e de&s;erved Favours which he was ready to be&s;tow upon them.</HI> But he, tho a&s;toni&s;h'd at the &s;uddain News, was unwilling to acknowledg him for King, whom he had not made him&s;elf; and therefore con&s;ulting with his Friends, return'd for an&s;wer, <HI>That he would then obey him, if</HI> Jacob, <HI>to whom he had already by Me&s;&s;age offer'd the Kingdom, did not come before</HI> June; <HI>and therefore begg'd that &s;hort delay. Su&s;neus,</HI> no way pleas'd with the Condition, wrote back to him again, <HI>That he was King already, and therefore would give place neither to</HI> Jacob, <HI>once before adjudg'd unworthy, nor to his Father</HI> Malec-Saghed, <HI>though he &s;hould return from the other World. Za&s;lac,</HI> having receiv'd this &s;urly An&s;wer, equally mettle&s;om and diligent, turns his Arms upon him, and comes on briskly to meet him. <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> finding him&s;elf prevented with the &s;pee|dy March of his Adver&s;ary, and perceiving him&s;elf over|match'd, and, which was wor&s;e, not well in health, retir'd to the Craggy Mountains of <HI>Amhara. Ras-Athana&s;ius</HI> al&s;o, who&s;e precipitancy <HI>Za&s;lac</HI> had upbraided, retreated into other Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es to avoid the Fury of his A&s;&s;ociate. In the mean time there being no News of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the other Captains and Commanders of the Army began to &s;catterwords of di&s;con|tent, <HI>That they would not be without a King, that if</HI> Jacob <HI>would not come, there was no Per&s;on fitter than</HI> Su&s;neus, <HI>neither would he be at re&s;t, till he had obtain'd by force, what they would not give him by fair means. Zaslac,</HI> fearing the Incon&s;tancy of his own People, and con&s;equently a Revolt, orders Commi&s;&s;ioners to be &s;ent; and by them &s;urrenders the Scepter to <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> who pre&s;ently &s;ent a Per&s;on to whom Allegiance &s;hould be &s;worn in his Name. Which being done, Ten of the chiefe&s;t Peers ride forth to
<PB N="185" REF="79">
meet the new King, and to conduct him with a Pomp be|fitting into the Camp. And now Shouts and Acclamations are to be every where heard. Neither were Banquets want|ing, with all other Solemnities u&s;ual at the Inaugurations of their Kings; when on a &s;udden new Commi&s;&s;ioners from <HI>Jacob,</HI> quite di&s;turb'd their mirth, with &s;uch a &s;uddain altera|tion, as with which Fortune never more odly mock'd before the hopes of tho&s;e that thought them&s;elves in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Throne. For <HI>Jacob</HI> twice Depos'd, twice re&s;tor'd, between the Highe&s;t and the Lowe&s;t, (which is mo&s;t rare) had twice Experience of the Mean betwixt both. While the Promoters of the&s;e Troubles exercis'd their Hatred and their Love with|out fear of puni&s;hment, that one might think it the &s;port of Scenes, rather than a &s;erious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Royalty. For im|mediatly <HI>Za&s;lac,</HI> without any he&s;itation, rode forth to meet <HI>Jacoh,</HI> as if he had bin <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> him&s;elf, to whom he had but ju&s;t before &s;worn Fidelity, and receiv'd him with the u&s;ual Ho|nours due to <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Maje&s;ty, and with his whole Army &s;alu|ted him King, the Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ent to <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> being pri|vately recall'd. <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> knowing Time was to be watch'd, once more gave way to Fortune, and retir'd to his former lurking holes, and hid him&s;elf again in the Natural Fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Amhara.</HI> For he had learnt from the Example of <HI>Zaden|ghel,</HI> to give way to Popular Heats and Tumults, till they cool'd of them&s;elves: for that the People after their fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;ions are &s;pent, re&s;ume their former Mode&s;ty, and return repenting to their duty. <HI>Ras-Athana&s;ius</HI> al&s;o, tho &s;o great a Per&s;on, yet accu&s;tom'd to follow Fortune, rather than his Faith, he, I &s;ay, with the &s;ame Ea&s;ine&s;s that he had acknow|ledg'd <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> fell at the feet of <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>And now <HI>Jacob,</HI> did not think it prudent to &s;uffer a Rival in his Dignity, and therefore re&s;olving to try what might be done by way of agreement, he commanded <HI>Su&s;neus</HI>'s Mother to go to her Son, and offer him the Kingdoms of <HI>Amhara, Wa|leka,</HI> and <HI>Shewa,</HI> as al&s;o all the Lands which his Father po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd, and he had hitherto claim'd in vain. But <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> bear|ing a lofty Soul, deny'd, <HI>That what he had receiv'd by the Gift of God, could be taken from him by Men. That the whole Kingdom was his due, which he would not relinqui&s;h but with his Life; That</HI> Jacob <HI>would deal with more Ju&s;tice and Uprightne&s;s, to quit his Dia|dem, than to ha&s;ten Ruin to him&s;elf and his Countrey.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="80">This haughty an&s;wer being deliver'd, <HI>Jacob</HI> decreed to de|cide the bu&s;ine&s;s not with Me&s;&s;ages, but by the Sword. How|ever, <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> Expert at delays, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Rocks and Mountains, avoyded the pur&s;uit of <HI>Jacob,</HI> watching for tho&s;e Opportunities which &s;oon after pre&s;ented them&s;elves. For <HI>Za&s;lac,</HI> whether out of a vain-glory to behold the Event of the Battel, or out of any private Indignation, did not joyn his Forces with <HI>Jacob;</HI> but on the contrary, and as it were in de&s;pight of Military di&s;cipline, acted all things carele&s;ly and remi&s;sly; believing his fame a Terror &s;ufficient to the Enemy. This was not conceal'd from <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> who taking a &s;horter way came upon <HI>Za&s;lac</HI> &s;o of a &s;uddain, that his Soul|diers had not time to handle their Arms, much le&s;s to put them&s;elves into order: &s;o that they were &s;lain like &s;heep, and utterly routed, and <HI>Za&s;lac,</HI> having lo&s;t his Army, was forc'd to entru&s;t his Safety to an ignominoous flight. Which Victory as it dejected <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Friends, &s;o it rais'd the &s;pirits of <HI>Su&s;neus</HI>'s Party. <HI>Za&s;lac</HI> him&s;elf had lo&s;t the Kings favour, and began to be &s;u&s;pected. Thus the bu&s;ine&s;s began to work; for <HI>Za&s;lac</HI> jealous of the&s;e di&s;paragements, notwith&s;tanding <HI>Jacob</HI> had heap'd &s;o many favours upon him, for he had created him <HI>Legate Royal,</HI> began to Enter into a Corre&s;pondence with <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> u&s;ing Treachery as the hire of tho&s;e that valu'd him mo&s;t. <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> &s;tanding in need of his Power, accepted his Propo&s;itions, and di&s;&s;embling his Hatred, made him a Con|federate in the War, to le&s;&s;en the force of his Enemy. <HI>Jacob</HI> hearing of his Revolt, judging that it behov'd him to make ha&s;t, before the re&s;t &s;hould follow his Example, re&s;olv'd to put it to the hazard of a Battel; well knowing that he far exceeded <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> in number of men: nor did <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> refu&s;e him, tho inferior: however, he cunningly kept the rough and hilly Grounds, watching like a Lyon when to take his fatal jump.</P>
<P>The Enemy judging his delay to proceed from his fear, and confiding in their multitude, began to act more daringly, and to provoke <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> with upbraiding Language, until he had brought them into a narrow place where he could not be &s;urrounded by his Enemies. Then Exhorting his Souldiers, <HI>Now,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>the day is come, that You may make me King of</HI> Ethi|opia: <HI>and for Your &s;elves, You are to be either Ma&s;ters or Slaves, as You behave Your &s;elves. I will not be onely the Companion of Your
<PB N="187" REF="80">
Victory, but your Dangers: Victory is in your own power, &s;o that you do not turn your backs to your Enemies, before you &s;ee me begin to flye.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus Encourag'd his Souldiers, he gave the Signal of Battel. Which &s;een, they gave &s;o furious an On&s;ett, that the Enemy was every where beaten down, without re&s;i&s;t|ance, amaz'd and a&s;toni&s;h'd, to be &s;o &s;ubdu'd by tho&s;e whom they reck'ned for fugitives. The &s;laughter was great, with little lo&s;s on <HI>Su&s;neus</HI>'s &s;ide. <HI>Jacob</HI> him&s;elf, toge|ther with <HI>Abuna-Peter,</HI> who had in vain thunder'd out his Anathema's again&s;t the Enemy, were both &s;lain. Which <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> under&s;tanding, &s;ounded a retreat, that by his cle|mency to the Common Soldiery and his own Country|men, he might win to him&s;elf the Reputation of Gen|tlene&s;s, nece&s;&s;ary for the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a New Prince.</P>
<P>But &s;uch was the Terror that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the hearts of the <HI>Jacobeans,</HI> forc'd on by the croud of Fugitives, igno|rant of the Country, tho there was no pur&s;uit, that they threw them&s;elves headlong in the night time from a Rock di&s;mally &s;teep and cragged. Among the re&s;t, there was a certain Portugue&s;e, by name <HI>Emanuel-Gon&s;alvo,</HI> who betimes perceiving his Hor&s;e as it were flying in the Air, quitting his Stirrups, left him, and taking hold by chance of the branch of a Tree, made a &s;hift to recover a Seat in the bough, where he &s;ate all night. Nor did he well un|der&s;tand his danger, till day appearing, he di&s;covered, not without horror, at a prodigious di&s;tance underneath him, a va&s;t heap of Men and Hor&s;es with their Limbs and Members broken all to flitters.</P>
<P><HI>Su&s;neus</HI> having obtain'd &s;o great a Victory, exercis'd no &s;o &s;ort of Severity or Reveng again&s;t any Per&s;on; only <HI>Maharhin</HI> he commanded to be beheaded, as being a follow|er of the &s;ect of <HI>I&s;lami&s;m,</HI> and the Per&s;on that had fir&s;t wounded <HI>Zadenghel.</HI></P>
<P>After that he departed for <HI>Coga,</HI> there to, &s;ettle the Af|fairs of his Kingdom, where <HI>Za&s;lac</HI> whom he could not endure to &s;ee, was &s;till in his Eye, the grand promoter of all the&s;e troubles. He was the fir&s;t that went over to <HI>Su&s;neus</HI>'s Party, and therefore was look't upon by <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> as one that would be con&s;tantly ca&s;ting in his Di&s;h the kind|ne&s;&s;es he had done, and pride him&s;elf to be the &s;etter up of kings. And indeed in one of his vain-glorious humors, of
<PB N="188" REF="81">
which de&s;erving Soldiers are generally too much guilty, he had unwarily given out, That it was foretold him, <HI>That he &s;hould pull down three Kings, which was fulfill'd in Two.</HI> So that the New King &s;eem'd only to be wanting for the third. It being therefore a Maxim, <HI>That jealou&s;ie and friend|&s;hip cannot long remain in one and the &s;ame Bre&s;t, and that the fruit of Trea&s;on being reap'd, there is no farther need of the Trai|tor,</HI> the King commanded him to be apprehended and car|ried away into the &s;teep Mountain of <HI>Gueman,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Gojam.</HI> He would not put him to death, as not believing it became a noble Prince to take away a mans life for fear of a future crime. But he making his E&s;cape, about a year after, invaded <HI>Waleka,</HI> where having gather'd together &s;ome Troops of Vagabonds and di&s;&s;olute Per&s;ons, he &s;upported him&s;elf by Robbery and Rapine; till at la&s;t, making his Incur&s;ions into <HI>Gojam,</HI> he was there &s;lain by the <HI>Pagans.</HI> His head being brought to the King, was fix'd upon a Lance, and &s;et up before the Roy|al Pavillion, to be view'd by all the World; no man pitying his misfortune, in regard that all people knew his advance|ment had co&s;t the lo&s;s of &s;o many innocent lives.</P>
<P>Not &s;o inglorious was the end of <HI>Ras-Athana&s;ius,</HI> and yet &s;ufficiently mi&s;erable. For he every day lo&s;ing more and more of the Kings favour, was at length the contempt of all men; In&s;omuch that his wife, the daughter of <HI>Malec-Saghed,</HI> unaccu&s;tom'd to brook indignities, for&s;ook his bed. Thus once the next to Supream authority, now the next to mo&s;t dejected mi&s;ery, not able to o'recome the angui&s;h of his mind, he fell into a Fever, of which he dy'd.</P>
<P>But <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in his Dominion, by all ways courted the friend&s;hip of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> as being skilful in the art of Gunnery and Fire-arms, the chiefe&s;t terror of tho&s;e Nations: hoping, &amp; that not without rea&s;on, by their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, to defend him&s;elf as well again&s;t his own Subjects, too much addicted to Tumults and Seditions, as the Kin|dred and Friends of the &s;lain Kings. And not only &s;o, but to render him&s;elf formidable to the <HI>Gallans.</HI> To that pur|po&s;e he kindly receiv'd the <HI>Fathers of the Society</HI> then living in <HI>Dembea.</HI> He &s;ent for <HI>Peter-Pays,</HI> and mo&s;t courteou&s;ly gave ear to him; and treated him as his familiar Friend.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="81">And as he was favourable and bountiful to them; &s;o did he dayly afford many te&s;timonies of his kindne&s;s to the re&s;t of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> and the more to oblige them he &s;et up the Latin Religion; nothing terrify'd by the example of <HI>Za-denghel.</HI> And indeed the Fathers had &s;uch a power o|ver him, that at length he &s;urrender'd him&s;elf to the Pope, and together with his Son, &s;ware obedience to him as Univer&s;al Bi&s;hop, and Vicar of Chri&s;t, abrogating the Religion of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Which was afterwards the occa&s;i|on of horrid uproars, bloody wars, and the &s;laughter of many great Per&s;onages.</P>
<P>But the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Kingdom won by the Sword, &s;el|dom enjoys a perfect tranquility, e&s;pecially when the death of the Predece&s;&s;or comes be in que&s;tion. For pre&s;ently, that is to &s;ay, the very next year, up &s;tarts a counterfeit <HI>Ja|cob,</HI> who alarum'd all <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> with the fear of a new War.

The Counterfeit therefore addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the Monks of the famous Mona&s;tery of <HI>Bizan,</HI> in the prefecture of <HI>Bahrnaga&s;&s;us;</HI> where he re|main'd, and to hide the fraud, as if his face had bin di&s;|figur'd with his wounds, went always vail'd. Nor was it long before his Story was believ'd. Not &s;o much out of re&s;pect to his own Per&s;on, as out of malice to <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> whom they hated as a Per&s;on that was unknown to them, and by his exilement inur'd to the Savage Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Gallans.</HI> Neither were they pleas'd with <HI>Raas-Seelech;</HI> his brother by the Mother's &s;ide, whom he had made Vice|roy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> whom they look'd upon al&s;o as a forraigner. So that he not being able him&s;elf to quell the Di&s;turban|ces, the King was forc'd to advance him&s;elf. But the Re|bels having intelligence of his coming, fled &s;everal ways, to avoyd fighting. Their Captain, with only four of his A&s;&s;ociates, and &s;ome few Goats, which he carry'd with him for their milks &s;ake, &s;ecur'd them&s;elves by a painful Pilgri|mage through the mo&s;t wild and uncouth concealments of Nature, that the Rocks could afford him, where it was im|po&s;&s;ible to trace him. So that the King di&s;pairing, after a tedious &s;earch, to find him out, return'd to <HI>Dembea,</HI> and ha|ving &s;olemniz'd his Inauguration at <HI>Axuma,</HI> after the anci|ent

<P>But what was more &s;trange, our <HI>Europe</HI> it &s;elf could not, &s;ome time after, di&s;cern an <HI>Aethiopian</HI> Counterfeit of the &s;ame name.</P>

But that which added to the Credit of the Impo&s;tor, was his graceful Pre&s;ence, with a Countenance wherein Seriou&s;ne&s;s and Frankne&s;s were won|derfully intermix'd, that while he kept company with other Princes, (as <HI>Bochart</HI> him&s;elf told me) he &s;eem'd to excel them all both for beauty of form, and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; and particularly that his Maje&s;tick A&s;pect &s;trook all his be|holders with admiration. Whether that Beauty were really in his Per&s;on, or whether the Novelty of the thing, or the Opinion that he was of the Race of <HI>Salomon,</HI> bya&s;s'd their Judgments.

However he was unhappy during his Reign, by rea|&s;on of his continual Wars, and the frequent Rebellions of his Subjects, whom he &s;ent to compel by force to &s;ubmit to what he thought convenient to enjoyn them. He &s;wore obedience to the Pope; before he had weigh'd what benefit he might get by it. And therefore toward his latter End, he was forc'd to indulge that Liberty, for the maintaining of which, many Thou&s;ands had already lo&s;t their Lives. He dy'd in <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> in the Year 1632. leaving &s;everal Sons and Daughters behind him.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Of the Royal Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Impri&s;onment of the Kings Children in the Rock <HI>Ge&s;hen,</HI> now quite out of u&s;e.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Certain Succe&s;&s;ion the Safety of Kingdoms. Two Bonds of Government. How far Prudence, how far Nobility and Power prevail. Election not alwayes to be preferr'd before Succe&s;&s;ion: more agreeable to Liberty. The Males only &s;ucceed in <HI>Aba&s;&s;ia.</HI> Their Claim dubious: hence Wars. The Incon|veniencies of Hereditary Kingdoms. The ill Events of uncertain Succe&s;|&s;ion. The Impri&s;onment of the Kings Children. <HI>Tellezius</HI>'s Relation of it. The Cu&s;tom for <HI>300</HI> Years, abrogated by <HI>Naod. Alvarez</HI>'s Relation: it di&s;agrees with <HI>Tellezius:</HI> reconcil'd: No pre&s;ident for half a Century. The plea&s;antne&s;s of tho&s;e Rocks fabulous. The &s;evere u&s;age of tho&s;e Prin|ces there. The &s;everity of the Governour di&s;plea&s;ing to the Prince: pleas'd him when King.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom what has bin &s;aid, it appears that the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> is uncertain; and that there is no great difference made between the Legitimate and he Illegi|timate. However, the mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured Safety of Kingdoms con|&s;i&s;ts in a Con&s;tant and E&s;tabli&s;h'd Settlement of Succe&s;&s;ion But if in Hereditary Kingdoms, it may be lawful either for the King to choo&s;e one of his Sons; or if it may be lawful for the Nobility, not &s;o much to regard the order of birth, as the di&s;po&s;ition and conditions of him that is to govern, or to re|&s;pect the favour of the People, War and Sedition mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity follow.</P>
<P>They that are &s;et a&s;ide will never be quiet; nor &s;hall they want Factious Abettors and A&s;&s;ociates. The Grand Pretence, more E&s;pecially in Elective Kingdoms, is this, <HI>That Conditions cannot be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by Nativities; but the best may be taken by Election and Judgment.</HI> A &s;pecious pretence in words, but vain in Reality; while the Imbecility of human Nature prevails, which is guided by the affections, and obeys rather Favour and Hatred, than Virtue; which u&s;ually happens in great A&s;&s;emblies. But there are two Pillars which &s;u&s;tain the Safety of great Monarchies, Reverence and Authority, which they that Govern never can reconcile to them&s;elves either by Wi&s;dom or Probity alone. For there are many who
<PB N="194" REF="86">
will e&s;teem them&s;elves if not their Superiors, yet their Equals: and men very unwillingly obey their Equals, much le&s;s their Inferiours: &s;o that it is altogether vain and pedantic, what <HI>Plato</HI> writes concerning the Felicity of Kingdoms, <HI>That they &s;hould be Govern'd by Philo&s;ophers,</HI> while other Aids are wanting. A Philo&s;opher, how wi&s;e &s;oever, would hardly find a Sub|ject that would obey him three days together for his Philo|&s;ophies &s;ake. There ought to be &s;omething External and Vi&s;ible, which as well the vulgar and ordinary &s;ort, as the prudent, Equally acknowledg, which is not &s;ubjected to the fluctuating and incon&s;tant determination of Men. For this rea&s;on in the Election of Kings and Princes, <HI>Nobility</HI> and Power are preferr'd before Wi&s;dom and Sanctity of di&s;po&s;i|tion. Yet the one requires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other. The one is the cau&s;e that the Subject willingly and freely obeys; the other compels the refractory to &s;ubmit. And therefore becau&s;e Election does not bring much more advantage to a Kingdom, than the chance of birth, but is rather liable to Tu|mults and Seditions, many People have<NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Swedes</HI> in the la&s;t Century. The <HI>Danes</HI> in our memory; The <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> of old. <HI>Joh. Newhoft.</HI> De&s;cript. <HI>Chin.</HI> c. 18.</NOTE> abandon'd it of their own accord. However, it approaches neare&s;t to Li|berty, becau&s;e the Electors may pre&s;cribe Laws and Condi|tions of Government to the Per&s;on that is to be Elected; tho that &s;ame warine&s;s proves many times ineffectual: Becau&s;e the Prince, upon refu&s;al, either po&s;itively cannot, or el&s;e will be very unwilling to be brought to an accompt. So im|po&s;&s;ible it is, that there &s;hould be a compleat happine&s;s in this World. And therefore it is the part of a good and prudent State&s;man to prefer that form of Government which he finds <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot">That the Wi&s;e call <GAP DESC="foreign">, to pre&s;erve the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Republic. <HI>I&s;oc.</HI> again&s;t <HI>Collimalh.</HI></NOTE> E&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But I return to the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> among whom there is this mo&s;t prudent Con&s;titution, That only the Male I&s;&s;ue &s;hall govern, or the Male kindred neare&s;t in blood; But becau&s;e the Determination of the Fathers and Mothers, and the chief Nobility happens frequently to be intermix'd; and that the natural I&s;&s;ue is likewi&s;e, if male, allow'd the &s;ame Priviledge for want of Legitimate Off-&s;pring: hence it comes to pa&s;s,
<PB N="195" REF="86">
that their Succe&s;&s;ions are mo&s;t unhappy and turbulent; the chief cau&s;e of all their Calamities.</P>
<P>We have already declar'd, how <HI>Helena,</HI> with the con&s;ent of <HI>Marc</HI> the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> preferr'd <HI>David</HI> the &s;econd Son before <HI>Naod</HI> the Elder Brother, as having nothing el&s;e to advance him but a meer bruti&s;h &s;trength. The Civil Wars between <HI>Menas</HI> and <HI>Tazcar</HI> his Brothers Elde&s;t Son; between the Ille|gitimate Son of <HI>Malec-Saghed,</HI> and <HI>Zadenghel</HI> his Legitimate Kinsman; and la&s;tly, between <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> and all about the doubtful right of Succe&s;&s;ion, are &s;ufficient Arguments to prove what we a&s;&s;ert. <HI>Tellezius</HI> indeed declares, That ac|cording to the Lawes of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the natural Sons do not &s;uc|ceed. But in another place, he &s;o di&s;cour&s;es concerning their Law, alledging the Example of <HI>John</HI> the Fir&s;t, King of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> that the Reader may perceive, that he varies in this, from his other Relation. But the chiefe&s;t Inconvenience which u&s;es to ari&s;e in hereditary Kingdoms, where the Succe&s;&s;ion is ty'd to a certain Family, proceeds either from the &s;ence of Rival&s;hip and a jealou&s;ie which they that rule have of them that are nearly related in blood; or from their Ambition, which always animates the Factious. Di&s;mal are the Ex|amples among the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> where there are no Laws or Rules for Succe&s;&s;ion, but all things are at the Will of them that bear &s;way, or el&s;e of Fortune her &s;elf. What ruin'd the Family of the <HI>Cae&s;ars?</HI> What the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire? but onely that the Creation of the Emperors was incon&s;tant and un|fix'd, and at the Will of the Souldiery. Certainly it was a great Over&s;ight in <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> after he had vanqui&s;h'd all his Rivals, and had all the Power in his own hands, that he ordain'd no certain Settlement of Succe&s;&s;ion. The Empe|rours of the <HI>Turks,</HI> to prevent the Crimes of their Brothers, more impiou&s;ly put them to death, and puni&s;h that Di&s;loyal|ty which perhaps was never intended. The Ancient Kings of <HI>Abe&s;sinia,</HI> to rid them&s;elves of the&s;e Fears, were wont to &s;hut up their Brothers under &s;afe Cu&s;tody, where they might abide unknown to turbulent Spirits; and &s;o be uncapable of attempting any thing again&s;t the raigning Prince; and yet be ready to &s;upply the want of Succe&s;&s;ors. The Rocks of <HI>Ge&s;hen</HI> and <HI>Amba&s;el</HI> were &s;et apart to this end. The whole Story from the Relations of <HI>Antonie d' Almeyda</HI> runs thus. The Emperour <HI>Icon Imlac</HI> had five Sons (others &s;ay nine) which he lov'd all alike. Out of which affection he mo&s;t imprudently
<PB N="196" REF="87">
advis'd them to raign all with Equal Power; or which was wor&s;e, to govern by turns. The Younge&s;t impatient of the delay of &s;o many Years, de&s;ign'd with him&s;elf not to part with the Scepter, when once he had got it into his hands, but to &s;end away his Brothers to &s;ome di&s;tant Rock, and &s;o con|tinue the Kingdom to his own Po&s;terity. But being betrayd by one of his peculiar Friends, who rather cho&s;e to accept of a reward from the raigning Prince, than to expect a guerdon from him that was to raign, he was taken in the &s;ame &s;nare which he had laid for his Brothers, and &s;ent to the Rock <HI>Ge&s;hen.</HI> But le&s;t the King might &s;eem to have con&s;ulted more for his own than the Security of the Kingdom, he al&s;o &s;hut up all his own Sons, which he then had, in the &s;ame place. After which this Cu&s;tom continu'd as a Fundamental Law in <HI>Ethio|pia,</HI> for above Two hundred and thirty Years, by which means the raigning Kings were &s;ecur'd from danger of Civil Wars among Brethren; till in the Year 1590, at what time King <HI>Naod</HI> was &s;ent for from the Rock to a&s;cend the Throne. He had a Son, about Nine years of Age, whom he dearly lov'd; which Child, one of his chief Courtiers &s;teadfa&s;tly beholding, <HI>Certainly,</HI> &s;aid he to the King, <HI>this Child grows apace.</HI> The Boy was of an acute Witt, and under&s;tood what the Courtier drove at, and therefore fixing his weeping Eyes upon his Fathers Face, <HI>Oh Father,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>Have I grown thus fa&s;t, to be hurry'd from your &s;ight to the Rock</HI> Ge&s;hen? Which word &s;trook his Father &s;o deeply to the heart, that having a&s;&s;embl'd the Nobility of his Court and Kingdom, he told them, <HI>That &s;uch a wicked and inhuman Cu&s;tom was to be renounc'd.</HI> Which was immediatly done, neither he nor his Council con|&s;idering that private affections are not to be preferr'd before the Safety of a Nation. And thus it came to pa&s;s, through the Kings un&s;ea&s;onable tenderne&s;s, that this &s;ame Cu&s;tome receiv'd and continu'd in <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> &s;o much to the Health of the Government, was abrogated to the un&s;peakable detri|ment of the Kingdom: And from that time never any Prince was Exil'd to tho&s;e Rocks.</P>
<P><HI>Alvarez</HI> writes, <HI>That</HI> David <HI>being advanc'd to the Throne, his Younger Brother, with the re&s;t of the Sons of</HI> Naod, <HI>were &s;ent away to the Rock;</HI> and afterwards, <HI>That one of the Younger Sons E&s;cap'd, but was taken and &s;ent back; and that he &s;aw him there.</HI> From whence it may be objected again&s;t <HI>Tellezius,</HI> That this Cu|&s;tome continu'd after <HI>Naod</HI>'s time. But we have &s;ome rea|&s;on
<PB N="197" REF="87">
to believe, That he fore&s;aw this Objection, becau&s;e he binds it with an A&s;&s;everation, &s;aying, <HI>The thing is certainly true, and is ea&s;ie to be confirm'd as well by the Fathers of the Society, as by the Example of</HI> Su&s;neus, <HI>who tho he had &s;everal Sons, yet never went about to &s;end any of them to the Rock.</HI> But then again when he &s;ayes <HI>Alvarez</HI> is to be believ'd in all things that he &s;aw, there is &s;ome need of Reconciliation: That is to &s;ay, That the Sons of <HI>Naod,</HI> the Brothers of <HI>David,</HI> were then carry'd to the Rock, and that one of them after an E&s;cape was taken and &s;ent back. So that the new Con&s;titution might not help them, tho it were a kindne&s;s to the Sons of the &s;ucceeding Kings. The Reports concerning the Plea&s;antne&s;s of tho&s;e Rocks, and the &s;plendid attendance upon tho&s;e Royal Exiles, are all ridicu|lous Fal&s;ities. The Rocks we have de&s;crib'd already. And as for the &s;plendidne&s;s of Attendance, when the Cu&s;tome was in force, mo&s;t certain it is, that tho&s;e Princes were kept clo&s;e Pri&s;oners, and they that either attempted to E&s;cape, or were a&s;&s;i&s;ting to their E&s;cape, lay under great Penalties. The Prin|ces them&s;elves were har&s;hly us'd; Neither was any per&s;on permitted to come at them, &s;o that their Education could never fit them for a Crown, but was rather to put them out of Hopes of having any thing to do with the Affairs of this World.</P>
<P>It is reported of one of the Keepers, that one morning ob|&s;erving one of his Royal Pri&s;oners putting on a Garment &s;omewhat neater than ordinary, he not only chidd him, and tore the Ve&s;tment, but gave notice of it to his Father: all which the poor Prince was forc'd to take patiently. After|wards the &s;ame Prince coming to be King him&s;elf, did not onely forbear to revenge the Injury, but hearing that his Keeper was gone a&s;ide, as dreading &s;ome heavy puni&s;hment, caus'd him to be &s;ought out, and being brought before him half dead for fear, both prais'd and rewarded him; Exhorting him to continue in his Office as Faithful to Him, as he had bin to the King deceas'd. And thus we generally impo&s;e upon others, what we are very unwilling to endure our &s;elves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> Of the Priviledge and Power of the King in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil Affairs.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Kings Power ab&s;olute: Experienc'd by the Je&s;uits. <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> the Patriarch offends the King. He claims the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction. He abrogates the Latin Religion; calls Synods: He forbears the right of Nomination: not bound by the Secular Laws. He has no E&s;tates. The benefit of them: He enjoyes all Royal Priviledges, but makes not u&s;e of all: Hunting Lawful for all. Private per&s;ons have nothing proper. The King takes and gives as he plea&s;es: Certain Families excepted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Power of the <HI>Abe&s;sinian</HI> Kings is ab&s;olute, as well in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical as Civil Affairs. Of which the Fathers of the Society have had &s;ufficient experience; in who&s;e favour, and to who&s;e di&s;advantage he has exercis'd his &s;upream Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Authority, without ever con&s;ulting the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria:</HI> Fir&s;t when he put forth &s;everal Edicts, for re|ceiving the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and abrogating the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Ceremonies: which was done with the con&s;ent of the Fa|thers. Afterwards the &s;tate of Affairs changing, when he di&s;penc'd by public Edict with certain Ceremonies that were indifferent, <HI>Alfon&s;us</HI> the Patriarch reprov'd him. <HI>It is not lawful,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>for a King to put forth any &s;uch Edict, as being purely Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and belonging to the Priestly Office: and You ought to remember what the High Prie&s;t &s;aid to King</HI> Uzziah. <HI>It belongs not to thee, O King</HI> Uzziah, <HI>to offer incen&s;e to the Lord, but to the Prie&s;ts, the Sons of</HI> Aaron, <HI>who are con&s;ecrated to that Mini|&s;try, get thee forth out of the Sanctuary, for it will not be imputed to thee as an honour by the Lord God;</HI> to which the Patriarch added the Puni&s;hment that follow'd. The King for that time gave way to the Patriarch, and publi&s;h'd the Edict in another manner and form. But not brooking the Compari&s;on made between him and <HI>Uzziah,</HI> among other things he gave the Patriarch this an&s;wer. <HI>Wherefore did&s;t thou bid us be mindful of</HI> Uzziah, <HI>and wherefore did&s;t thou compare us with him? He was therefore puni&s;h'd by God, for u&s;urping the Office of the Prie&s;t which did not become him; and becau&s;e he offer'd Incen&s;e and Sacrifice to God, which We never attempted to do: onely We commanded an Edict
<PB N="199" REF="88">
to be publi&s;h'd about tho&s;e Indifferent things which were agreed on be|tween Us both.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing more incens'd the King, but that he &s;aw his Pre|rogative call'd in que&s;tion, which for &s;o many Ages had bin enjoy'd by his Ance&s;tors, and which was never deny'd by the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> even before the Schi&s;me. Nor was he ignorant what the ancient Emperours after <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> had done in the &s;ame Ca&s;es. Nor was he &s;o dull of apprehen|&s;ion, as not to be able to di&s;tingui&s;h between Epi&s;copal rules, and Kingly Juri&s;diction, which he thought belong'd to him|&s;elf. Which Prerogative, tho he had a great Reverence for the Patriarch, he would not part with, but rather cho&s;e to publi&s;h another Edict, which tended manife&s;tly to the Dimi|nution of the Patriarchal Power. For the Patriarch had or|der'd a certain Monk to give &s;ome part of his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenues to a certain Pari&s;h. The Monk would not obey; but complain'd to his Superiour, one <HI>Iceg,</HI> who obtain'd a Decree from the King, wherein the Patriarch was enjoyn'd to keep to the Rules of the Metropolitans of Ancient <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> and that <HI>Iceg</HI> &s;hould enjoy his due Priviledges.</P>
<P>His Prerogative in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs was mo&s;t apparent|ly made manife&s;t, by the making of that &s;evere Decree for the abrogating the Latin Wor&s;hip, and re&s;toring that of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> Moreover, the King &s;ummons the Synods of the Clergy, as often as need requires; he &s;ends for the Me|tropolitan out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> exerci&s;ing plenary Juri&s;diction over him and all the re&s;t of his Clergy: and puni&s;hing them ac|cording to the nature of their Offences, which the Examples recited by <HI>Alvarez,</HI> &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate. In one thing however he differs from our <HI>European</HI> Kings, that he never nominates to Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Benefices. For the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &s;ends a Metropolitan, at the reque&s;t of the King indeed; but he knows not who or what he is. He al&s;o ad|mitted the Patriarch, whom the Pope &s;ent, tho not he but the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> nam'd him.</P>
<P>Neither are there in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> any other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Dig|nities; and therefore the Prerogative of nominating Bi&s;hops and Archbi&s;hops, &s;ignifies little or nothing. In Seculars he acknowledges no po&s;itive Laws. And well it were that he did not think him&s;elf al&s;o altogether free from the Funda|mental
<PB N="200" REF="89">
Laws of his Realm, upon which the Safety of the Kingdom depends.</P>
<P>For <HI>Naod</HI> di&s;penc'd with the whole&s;ome Con&s;titutions of his Ance&s;tors, by vertue of which the Kings Children were &s;ent to the Rock of <HI>Amhara.</HI> And <HI>Malec-Saghed</HI> would have preferr'd his natural Son <HI>Jacob</HI> before his Brothers Legitimate Son <HI>Zadenghel;</HI> both which prov'd very di&s;advantagious pre|&s;idents to the whole Nation.</P>
<P>But &s;uch things frequently come to pa&s;s, where the King|dome is without E&s;tates. For they are the mo&s;t Tru&s;ty Guar|dians of the Law, and the true Bulwarks of the Peoples Li|berty again&s;t the Encroachments of the Ambitious. For they have a more vigilant eye and tender care over the Common|weal, of which they are them&s;elves Members, than the Friends of Princes, who&s;e Fortunes hardly de&s;cend to their Heirs; &s;o that a man may admire at their Coun&s;els, who ta|king away the Priviledges of <HI>E&s;tates,</HI> endeavour to a&s;&s;ume the whole Power into their own hands, as deeming every &s;light bond of the Law, to them&s;elves heavy and intollerable. So that they are forc'd to di&s;tribute tho&s;e Favours and Kind|ne&s;&s;es which are due to their fellow Citizens, among the Souldiery, who&s;e fidelity is brittle and incon&s;tant: not caring who are poor, &s;o they be rich: and many times the Souldiers turn tho&s;e Arms which were put into their hands for the de|fence of their Prince, again&s;t him; being put upon the fer|ment either by the Ambition or the Wealth of &s;ome parti|cular per&s;on. Which in <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> as in all other ab&s;olute Goverments, frequently happens to the de&s;truction of tho&s;e that bear the &s;way.</P>
<P>He has al&s;o the &s;ole di&s;po&s;al of Peace or Warr, and indeed all the Prerogatives that a King can claim (both the greater and the le&s;&s;er <HI>Regalia</HI>) are &s;olely at his devotion; tho he makes no u&s;e of many of them, merely becau&s;e he is igno|rant of them; as the Prerogative in reference to Metals, Coyning of Money, and the like. As for the liberty of Hunt|ing, he grants it to all; in regard there are &s;uch multitudes of Wild Bea&s;ts that breed up and down in the over-grown Woods and high Mountains, that it is not onely trouble&s;ome but dangerous to find out their haunts: by which means that
<PB N="201" REF="89">
which in other Countries is a Plea&s;ure, to the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> be|comes a Toyl and Detriment.</P>
<P>One thing is much to be admir'd, and rare ev'n among the <HI>Turks,</HI> which is, that no private per&s;on, whether Pea&s;ant or Lord, except &s;ome few can call any thing his own. All the Lands and Farms in the Country belong to the King, and are held by the Subjects onely at the Kings plea&s;ure, &s;o that no man takes it ami&s;s, if the King takes away their Lands and be&s;towes them upon another as he plea&s;es him&s;elf; and that not onely after two or three years, but al&s;o the &s;ame year they were given: So that it often happens that one man ploughs, and another man &s;owes. Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that they are more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their Kings, then a Servant to his Ma|&s;ter, or a Va&s;&s;al to his Lord: they &s;erve him in Peace and War; and bring him Pre&s;ents according to their Ability, in hopes of obtaining new Farms, or for fear of lo&s;ing tho&s;e they have. For being commanded out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, they never grumble, but pre&s;ently obey without the lea&s;t di&s;ta&s;t again&s;t the King, or envy to the per&s;on that &s;ucceeds in their Room. Cu&s;tome and long u&s;e prevailing, while they &s;ee the &s;ame happening to others. However there are &s;ome ancient and Illu&s;trious Families, e&s;pecially in <HI>Tigra,</HI> who enjoy by right of Inheritance not only Lands and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions purchas'd by their Ance&s;tors, but &s;ome certain Prefectures al&s;o, retaining their ancient Title; as <HI>Bahr-Naga&s;h, Shum Seraw&egrave; Sir&egrave;, Temben,</HI> and others; as al&s;o <HI>Cantiba</HI> in <HI>Dembea;</HI> over whom the King claims no other Authority, than to confer the public Employments every two year, or yearly, or as he plea&s;es, upon others; yet &s;o as that they be of the &s;ame Family.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SO great and &s;o ab&s;olute a Power, and &s;o uncontroulable a Dominion over their Subjects, one would think &s;hould render the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> va&s;tly Potent: and &s;o no doubt it would, if other things were corre&s;pondent.

Gregory</HI> al&s;o affirm'd the &s;ame, and that the Hi&s;tory was to be &s;een in his Country. But when the <HI>Saracens</HI> grew &s;tronger, and had invaded the Neighbouring Kingdoms, the <HI>Abi&s;sines,</HI> relinqui&s;hing <HI>Axuma,</HI> and turning the force of their Arms again&s;t the more upland parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> enlarg'd their Empire by the Overthrow of &s;everal weak and effeminate Nations, no more regarding forraign Countries, or the &s;ub|duing of far di&s;tant Regions: which was the rea&s;on that af|ter that, they perform'd nothing that was memorable abroad. However they were Potent at home, and had under them &s;everal petty-Princes that were their Tributaries. And in this Greatne&s;s they flouri&s;h'd, in the time of <HI>Helena</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> till it was not only &s;haken by that Dreadful Warr with the <HI>A|delans;</HI> but &s;o overturn'd, that it never could recover it &s;elf af|terwards. For about that time the <HI>Gallans</HI> al&s;o breaking out, and never after that &s;ubdu'd, layd wa&s;t and harra&s;s'd the mo&s;t Opulent and mo&s;t Noble Provinces of the Empire: and &s;till to this day every year gain upon the re&s;t with their continual Incur&s;ions. However, that Power which yet remains is &s;o con&s;iderable, that if they would but make u&s;e of the Arts and Arms of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> they might not onely &s;ubdue tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> but al&s;o recover their Lo&s;t Dominions. For a Kingdom well order'd within, under &s;uch a Monarch, where the People are under &s;o much &s;ubjection; &s;o large a liberty to do well or ill; if Concord and Unity attended the&s;e Op|portunities, together with a con&s;tant method of Coun&s;els, it is impo&s;&s;ible, but that they mu&s;t &s;oon prevail over a wandring Nation, divided among them&s;elves into &s;o many Tribes and Factions. All their truculent and &s;avage fury would be in vain, if the &s;treights of the Mountains were but well forti|fy'd

and guarded with Field-Pieces. They &s;hould al&s;o &s;end forth &s;everal Colonies, and give them a ta&s;t of the Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, by which the wilde&s;t of Nations oft-times grow tame. But which is more than all, and which the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire, Towns &s;hould be built, and repleni&s;h'd with people, and an increa&s;e of Wealth be permitted by the En|couragement of Arts and Arms. La&s;tly, if the Kng would remit &s;omething of his Prerogative which he has over the E&s;tates of the Subject, and re&s;erving tho&s;e Lands which are already till'd, to him&s;elf, would di&s;tribute to his Souldiers and the re&s;t of his People &s;uch Lands as &s;hould be won from the Enemy, every one his proportion, and grant them an ir|revocable Inheritance of &s;uch Lands; &s;ettling al&s;o Duke|doms and Earldoms in fee-&s;imple out of the Conquer'd Coun|tries, upon his Nobility, and be&s;t de&s;erving Captains, no doubt but in a &s;hort time, it would prove the mo&s;t flouri&s;h|ing Kingdom in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> greatly to the propagation of the Chri|&s;tian Religion.</P>
<P>And it &s;eems but rea&s;on, that in the &s;ettling and ordering his Kingdom, the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> Prince &s;hould be advis'd and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>European</HI> Princes, not onely out of Chri&s;tian Charity and hopes of propagating Chri&s;tianity over <HI>Africa,</HI> but al&s;o to le&s;&s;en the Power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> which would fol|low, were the Dominion of the Red Sea but wre&s;ted out of his hands, and the Commerce of <HI>Egypt</HI> &s;poyl'd. Ah! what pity it is, that we &s;hould be &s;o ill affected towards other Chri&s;tian Nations, that unle&s;s they are of the &s;ame Opinion with us in all points of Divinity; or unle&s;s they promi&s;e us large Rewards, or an ample &s;hare of their Profits, we can pa|tiently look on, and &s;ee them peri&s;h, while the mo&s;t invete|rate Enemies of the Chri&s;tian Faith are enrich'd with the &s;poyls of their Wealth; not con&s;idering that in the end the mi&s;chief will redound to our &s;elves: and that we &s;hall one day, unle&s;s God in mercy prevent it, dearly pay for our Di&s;|&s;en&s;ions.</P>
<P>Thus we forbore to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Grecian</HI> Emperours, and &s;eve|ral of the Ea&s;tern Princes, till they became at la&s;t a prey to the <HI>Ottomans.</HI> Thus, while none of Us lay'd it to heart, <HI>Egypt</HI> was reduc'd under the Power of the <HI>Turk;</HI> a va&s;t addition to their Empire: as if it were a Crime to breed up Doggs to hunt the Wolves. Now the rea&s;on why the <HI>Abi&s;sines</HI> do not court with greater ardour the Alliances of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> is
<PB N="205" REF="91">
plain: for it is to be attributed either to their ignorance, or their difference in Opinion from the <HI>Latines.</HI> Moreover, they fail very much in this, that they permit the <HI>Turk</HI> to be Ma|&s;ters of the Ports and Ilands of the Red Sea, whereby it is ab&s;olutely at their plea&s;ure what Per&s;ons or Commodities &s;hall pa&s;s in and out. But they under&s;tand not, that there is no Nation can be truly Powerful and Great, that does not Command &s;ome Sea-Towns.</P>
<P>As for the Revenues of the King, they are not paid in ready money, but in the natural Productions of the Countries, the mo&s;t equal &s;ort of Tribute. For &s;ome Provinces afford Gold; others Hor&s;es, Cattel, Sheep, Corn and Ox Hides, and &s;ome few, where Weavers live, &s;end him Garments. They bring their Gold rough and unrefin'd, as they gather it up among the Sands of the Rivers, or digg it out under the Roots of Trees, or el&s;e with le&s;s Labour find it loo&s;e upon the Earth. For they know not how to coyn money, but after the ancient manner, weigh their Mettal, wherein they are many times gull'd by forraign Merchants, who frequently deny the Gold to be pure; and therefore change it for the meane&s;t of their Commodities. How much better might the King provide for him&s;elf and his Subjects, &s;hould he with Money of his own Coyn, buy up all the Gold in his Kingdom, to his own and the great advantage of his People. <HI>Enarea</HI><NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">15000 <HI>Patachs</HI> of <HI>Portugal</HI> or <HI>German</HI> Dollars.</NOTE> pays a Thou|&s;and and five hundred Ounces of Gold: formerly much more. To <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> it pay'd but a Thou&s;and, and &s;ometimes but Five hundred, when the <HI>Enareans</HI> were either at Wars with the <HI>Gallans,</HI> or el&s;e embroyl'd one with another. <HI>Gojam</HI> pays every Year Eleven hundred Ounces, and &s;ome Garments, to the value of 3000 <HI>German</HI> Dollars, together with Two hun|dred Fu&s;tian Tape&s;tries, very broad and clo&s;e woven. Formerly they al&s;o pay'd a Tribute of Hor&s;es, but <HI>Malec-Saghed</HI> remit|ted that, to the end they might be the better able to with|&s;tand the <HI>Gallans.</HI> Out of <HI>Tigra</HI> he receives Five and twenty thou&s;and Patachs. Out of <HI>Dembea</HI> Five thou&s;and. As much out of other Kingdoms, or &s;ometimes le&s;s. There are al&s;o &s;everal <HI>Tolls</HI> pay'd, but generally granted to the Nobility for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance; except tho&s;e of the high Mountain, <HI>Lamal|mona,</HI> over which all the Merchants and Merchandize mu&s;t pa&s;s from the Red Sea into <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> which the King re&s;erves
<PB N="206" REF="92">
to him&s;elf. He al&s;o has his Lands and Farms, from whence he is &s;erv'd with Provi&s;ions for his Table, ten or twelve Hor&s;e-Loads at a time. La&s;tly, <HI>Dembea, Gojam,</HI> and <HI>Bagemdra</HI> find him Corn and Fle&s;h. That which he receives out of <HI>Dembea</HI> is di&s;tributed among the Souldiers which have no Land, or el&s;e among the Poor. But his chief Tribute is from the Gra|ziers, who are bound to pay him every Tenth Oxe or Cow every Three Years: which is as much as if they &s;hould pay the 30th every Year. And the whole Empire is &s;o divided, that every Year he has his certain Tribute of Cows and Oxen. Be&s;ides, every Year every Chri&s;tian Weaver pays him a Fu|&s;tian Garment; Every Mahumetan a <HI>Drim,</HI> or Patach, which amounts to a Thou&s;and <HI>Imperials</HI> every Year.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly the Revenues of this Empire &s;eem to be ve|ry &s;mall, if we con&s;ider the Extent of &s;o many Large Pro|vinces. But on the other &s;ide we are to ob&s;erve, That the Prices of all things are very low. A huge Oxe may be bought for half a Dollar.

<P>Again, if we con&s;ider the plenty of all things; the <HI>Abi&s;sine</HI> Emperour has enough and to &s;pare: not that his Diadem gli|&s;ters with Gemms or Pearls, or that his Trea&s;uries are full of Money; or that his Cupboards &s;hine with Silver and Gold Plate; or that his Table is &s;pread with Forraign Banquets while his Subjects are in want, -his Courtiers poor, and his Souldiers under penury. But he has that which &s;uffices to afford him moderate Dyet, and &s;lender Cloathing. Then for his Souldiers and his Warlike Subjects, that is to &s;ay, his poor People, they, detain'd at home by no delicacies, are ready &s;till to gird on their Swords.

Some of the Pillars are &s;till to be &s;een, with In&s;criptions of unknown Letters, remaining ar|guments of their Antiquity, now demoli&s;h'd by the Wars, or defac'd with Age. The City it &s;elf, now totally ruin'd, looks more like a Village, than a Town of Note; <HI>&s;o fading and in|con&s;tant are tho&s;e things which men account mo&s;t durable.</HI> How many Cities, how many Monuments now lye in a&s;hes, who&s;e Founders are well known? and how many are yet in being, who&s;e Founders are unknown? As for this, it began to fall to decay by degrees, pre&s;ently after that the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;|&s;inia</HI> relinqui&s;h'd it, and remov'd their Court from thence, as being depriv'd of tho&s;e advantages that attend the abodes of Princes. Thus the Seat of the Empire being Tran&s;lated to <HI>Byzantium,</HI> the <HI>We&s;t</HI> was neglected. And the &s;ame Fate, no doubt, had certainly befallen <HI>Rome,</HI> had it not bin &s;u&s;tain'd by the Care of the Bi&s;hops, now the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiffs. In the time of the <HI>Adelan</HI> Warr, the Revolt of the Vice-Roy of <HI>Ti|gra</HI> in the Raign of King <HI>Menas;</HI> and la&s;tly, when the <HI>Turks</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="93" MS="y">
invaded that Country, it was totally lay'd wa&s;t; and now can &s;carcely &s;helter a hundred Inhabitants: onely the Ruines &s;till remain, to te&s;tifie that once it was great and populous. It is Seated in the Fourteenth degree and a half of Northern Latitude, Encircled with plea&s;ant and fertile Fields which afford a Pro&s;pect becoming a Royal Man&s;ion. It lies di|&s;tant from the Red-Sea Five and forty <HI>Portugal</HI> Leagues, or &s;ix or Seaven tire&s;om days Journey by rea&s;on of the Moun|tains that lye between. The antient things of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> were wont to be here inaugurated; nor would <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> admit of his Coronation in any other place, though when he related the particulars of the Ceremonies to the Commander of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> he could not but laugh at them, as ridicu|lous him&s;elf, <HI>For many things are to be done by Princes to plea&s;e the Vulgar, which to others may &s;eem &s;uperfluous,</HI> Such as were for the mo&s;t part the <HI>Solemn Ceremonies of the Antients inven|ted by mean Capacities, but retain'd by the more prudent. Tellezius</HI> thus &s;ets them down. When <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> was to be Crown'd, fir&s;t the Ma&s;ters of the Ceremonies, read to the King out of their Memorandums, how and in what order every thing was to be perform'd. The Army being drawn up, the Foot march'd fir&s;t: then follow'd the Hor&s;e with their Trap|pings: after them the Courtiers Comb'd, and neatly habi|ted: pre&s;ently appear'd the Emperour him&s;elf upon a &s;tately Prauncer, clad with a clo&s;e Purple Dama&s;cene Tunic, and over that a magnificent <HI>Attalic</HI> Ve&s;tment, with narrow Sleeves hanging down to the ground. When they came to a great Stone engraven with Forraign Characters, not far from the Church of <HI>Axuma,</HI> near to which the Solemnities of the Inau|guration us'd to be perform'd, the Emperour with all the Courtiers alighting from their Hor&s;es, &s;tood upon the Ground that was &s;pread with rich Carpets. At what time the Vir|gins of <HI>Axuma,</HI> holding a Silken Cord cro&s;s the Street &s;topp'd the Way, and as the King pre&s;s'd to go forwards, they hin|dred him, and ask'd him, <HI>Who he was?</HI> who an&s;wering, <HI>I am the King of the I&s;raelites.</HI> They reply'd, <HI>Surely thou art not our King.</HI> Which &s;aid, he retir'd &s;miling. At length being ask'd a third time; he reply'd, <HI>I am the King of Sion:</HI> and drawing forth his Cimitar, cut the Cord: which done, the Virgin cry'd out, <HI>Of a certainty, thou art our King of Sion.</HI> Pre|&s;ently all the Guns they have are fir'd, and the neighbouring Mountains rang with loud Acclamations; the Drums beat

to the noi&s;e of the Flutes, and the Trumpets fill'd the Air with harmonious Levets. Which done, the <HI>Metropolitan Simeon</HI> accompany'd with all the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Orders of Clerks, Monks, and Canons, &s;inging &s;everal Songs and Hymns, conducted the King to the fir&s;t Porch of the Church, and there &s;et the Diadem upon his Head. The King being crown'd, if it may be &s;o call'd; proceeded forward into the Temple, and there receiv'd the Euchari&s;t; which having done he rode back to the Camp with his Diadem upon his head. For in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> they u&s;e no Scepter. Nor is the Crown any other than a Hatt twice doubled, with an Azure colour'd Silken broad brimm trimm'd with Gold and Silver Plates, in the likene&s;s Lillies; with a row of fal&s;e &s;tones gli&s;tering between every Plate.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides <HI>Axuma,</HI> there are no Cities in <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> and but few Towns. In the Kingdom of <HI>Tigra, Dobarva</HI> is the Seat of the Vice-Roys: <HI>Fremona,</HI> the fir&s;t Re&s;idence of the Fathers of the Society, enlarg'd by the <HI>Portugue&s;es. Gubay,</HI> a Town in <HI>Dembea,</HI> where the Queen re&s;ides. <HI>Nanina</HI> in <HI>Gojam,</HI> long inhabited by the <HI>Portugue&s;es. Macana celace,</HI> in <HI>Amhara.</HI> To reck'n up more is not worth the while: neither is it certain whether tho&s;e already mention'd are &s;tanding or no.

In places that are fertile and till'd, you &s;hall &s;ee the Fields, as it were, planted with Hou&s;es, which affords no unplea&s;ant Pro&s;pect. They have neither Ca&s;tles nor Forts. The Celebrated Mountains of <HI>Amhara</HI> are their onely Cita|dels, where the Kings Children were formerly committed to Cu&s;tody. The <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> wonder to hear of &s;o many great Cities among Us.

For they pitch their Tents up and down the Country, and cut down and make havock of what ever they have need of, without any con&s;ideration of the dammage, or regard to the future.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Kings Court, his Titles, and his Court-Officers.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Kings live in Tents: <HI>P. Pays</HI> built a Palace. The Kings Table. Wo|men attend: Plain dyet. The King and the Nobility cramm'd. They drink after they have done: They read the whole P&s;alter before meales. The ancient manner of receiving Amba&s;&s;adors: now chang'd. Formerly two Court Officers: di&s;continnu'd. The <HI>Ras</HI> now chief Mini&s;ter in Peace and War. Officers be&s;ide.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> left <HI>Axuma,</HI> they never had any con&s;tant Man&s;ion, nor any Palaces, but contented them&s;elves to live in Tents. But at length <HI>Peter Pays</HI> built the King a Palace after the <HI>European</HI> manner, which co&s;t him an incredible deal of Labour and Indu&s;try; for that in regard of the want of Arti&s;ts, he was forc'd to teach them every thing, and to look after the Work like a Ma&s;ter-Buil|der. He cho&s;e to build this Hou&s;e in a mo&s;t commodious and delightful place call'd <HI>Gorgora,</HI> being a kind of Penin&s;ula, almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the <HI>Tzanic</HI> Lake, where the King was wont to take up his Winter-Quarters, and contriv'd it very &s;pacious and beautiful, with Rooms of State, Bed-Chambers, Galleries, Battlements and Balconies, which yielded a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect over the Lake, and the Neighbouring Fields. In&s;omuch, that it was not inferiour to the Country Palaces of &s;ome of our <HI>Europeans</HI> Princes. The <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> were amaz'd when they &s;aw one &s;tory rais'd above another, which they thought could never have bin done: and call'd it <HI>Hou&s;e upon Hou&s;e.</HI> Nor till that time did they believe the Fathers, when they told them of the numerous and &s;plendid Palaces, Sumptuous Cathedrals, and Stately Mona&s;teries in <HI>Europe.</HI> For tho&s;e things they related to the <HI>Abe&s;sines,</HI> to make them in love with the Magnificence and Maje&s;ty of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church.</P>
<P>The Garniture of the Kings Table is much different from
<PB N="211" REF="94">
ours. For no per&s;on is admitted into the Room while the King is at Dinner; or if any of the Nobility be invited, they mu&s;t &s;tay till the King ri&s;es: then they take their places at the &s;ame Table, and eat the Kings Leavings, which is look'd upon as a very great Honour. Yet the Fathers of the Society were admitted to Dine by them&s;elves, in the &s;ame Room next to <HI>Su&s;neus</HI>'s Bed-Chamber. To which purpo&s;e there were two low little round Tables, about Eighteen Spans in Compa&s;s, brought in to the Room and plac'd upon the Ground which was &s;pread with Carpets; one le&s;&s;er for the King, another bigger for the Fathers, but without Table-Cloaths or Napkins: in&s;tead of which they made u&s;e of thin Wafers made of Wheat or Rie pa&s;t. So that their Table|cloaths &s;erv'd them for Bread, which there was no need for the Servants to take away, fold up, or wa&s;h: no Trenchers, Knives, Forks, nor Spoons: no Salt-&s;eller, no Pepper or Su|gar-box; nothing of Extravagant was there to be &s;een: A great Ea&s;e to them in time of Warr; to us an impediment, while &s;o many Carts, &s;o many Waggons are requir'd to carry Kitchin Uten&s;ils, and Kitchin Officers, to plea&s;ure our Luxu|ry. The Meat is &s;erv'd up by Women, not in Gold or Silver Di&s;hes, but in broad Earthen Platters, which would never tempt an <HI>European</HI> Thief. They are made of black Clay, with covers of Straw neatly woven and painted. The meat is very ordinary, Fle&s;h and Broths of &s;everal &s;orts boyl'd after their fa&s;hion. So &s;oon as the Di&s;hes are mar&s;hall'd; the Hangings are pre&s;ently let down, le&s;t any one &s;hould &s;ee the King while he is eating: and truly there is good Rea&s;on why. For, the King and the chief Nobility, a thing you would think almo&s;t incredible, account it a great trouble to lift their hands to their mouths. And therefore the Children belonging to Court, take the meat and put it in their mouths, and if the Gobbets be too bigg, they thru&s;t 'em in, as they do that cramm Capons. The crumms that fall, &s;ometimes they put again i' their chopps after they are well &s;oak'd in the Broth. A way of eating that may well de&s;erve a good thick covering: as being a &s;ight, that would certainly cau&s;e our &s;queami&s;h Stomachs, that will hardly eat off of one an|others Trenchers, to ri&s;e a hungry. But this is common both to Lord and Pea&s;ant, that they never drink till they have done feeding.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="95">One thing we mu&s;t not omit, which is, that they always read Prayers both before and after meals: a thing that &s;ome of our Courtiers are in a manner a&s;ham'd of, who will hard|ly tarry to hear a &s;hort Grace; while here you &s;hall have the whole <HI>P&s;alter</HI> repeated at their great Fea&s;ts, without any in|convenience to the Gue&s;ts: For he who&s;e Office it is, di&s;tri|butes to every one a part. The King and they that are ac|cu&s;tom'd to it, know their proper time. The larger <HI>P&s;almes</HI> are divided among more, the &s;horter to one &s;ingly. And thus by &s;everal, the whole <HI>P&s;alter</HI> is read, as it were, in a moment. For the <HI>P&s;alter</HI> is made u&s;e of by all: neither have they any other Book for dayly Prayer.</P>
<P>Their manner of giving Audience to Amba&s;&s;adors is diffe|rent from what it was in former times. For <HI>Alvarez</HI> relates how that after long waiting, and a deal of haughty formali|ty, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour, <HI>Lodowic Limaeus,</HI> was four times ask'd <HI>From whence he came?</HI> and that he receiv'd no other an|&s;wer the fir&s;t day, but that <HI>They were Welcome:</HI> nor were they admitted to the King; and yet Pre&s;ents were to be left. Nor was the Emba&s;&s;adour to be Vi&s;ited by any one, before he had ki&s;s'd the Kings hands. At length, after he had bin &s;everal times call'd, he was fir&s;t admitted to di&s;cour&s;e the King, the Hangings being let down between them; and at la&s;t, with much ado, to &s;ee and &s;alute the King. Of which the chief Rea&s;on was thought to be, becau&s;e he had brought no Pre|&s;ent (for it is not lawful to appear before the Ea&s;tern or <HI>Afri|can</HI> Kings, without an acknowledgment) or el&s;e becau&s;e he wanted the Kings Credentials. Which &s;uperbne&s;s is now a days layd a&s;ide; for that being humbled by &s;o many Lo&s;&s;es and Calamities, they begin to reckon Urbanity and Civility among the re&s;t of the Vertues.</P>
<P>Among the Court Employments, the chiefe&s;t Dignity was that of the Per&s;on who was call'd <HI>Bahtudet,</HI> of whom one was of the <HI>Right</HI> hand, and the other of the <HI>Left.</HI> They were the chief Mini&s;ters of State, and manag'd all Affairs, and were entru&s;ted with all the Kings Secrets; with them alone the King con&s;ulted; few others being admitted into his Pre|&s;ence: as if Maje&s;ty were more Venerable when conceal'd. But afterwards &s;o much Greatne&s;s in Subjects began to grow
<PB N="213" REF="95">
irk&s;ome to the Kings; and &s;ome there are al&s;o that abu&s;e their Power: few men being able to contain them&s;elves within tho&s;e Bounds of moderation, to be able to do all things, and yet not to covet all things. For there are many Examples of tho&s;e, who out of a de&s;ire of pre&s;erving their Greatne&s;s, have requited their Ma&s;ters with ill Turns for Fa|vours of the highe&s;t nature; making u&s;e of that authority which they receiv'd from their Princes, to their mi&s;chief. By which means <HI>Kings</HI> have bin overwhelm'd by the hatred of the People; or el&s;e have bin forc'd to pull down that Great|ne&s;s with extream hazard, which they them&s;elves advanc'd. Tho&s;e Princes act more prudent that keep the Power in their own hands, never tru&s;ting to the Management of one &s;ingle Per&s;on. Neither are they le&s;s provident Mini&s;ters, who ne|ver affect it: For the Grand Affairs of a Kingdom are more &s;afely and ea&s;ily manag'd by Plurality.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ucceeded another Chief Officer whom the <HI>Ethi|opians</HI> call <HI>Ras,</HI> from the Arabic word which &s;ignifies a <HI>Head.</HI> The rea&s;on of who&s;e in&s;titution at fir&s;t, was for the Command of the Army. But as Warlike Command, and Martial Fame excell all other accompli&s;hments; it came to pa&s;s in a &s;hort time, that the&s;e chief Generals advanc'd them&s;elves above all others, to govern the Kings Coun&s;els, and &s;o by degrees to be the chief Mini&s;ters of State for the management of all Affairs, both Forraign and Dome&s;tic, &s;uch a one was <HI>Ras-Athana&s;ius,</HI> who fir&s;t depo&s;ed <HI>Zadenghel,</HI> and then <HI>Jacob,</HI> &s;o that <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> did not hold it convenient to confer &s;o great a dignity upon any per&s;on, unle&s;s it were by his Brother by the Mothers &s;ide, by name <HI>Ras-Selach.</HI> Next to him, there are two Comptrollers of the Court. The upper Comptroller, who is called <HI>Bellatenot-Gueta,</HI> as much as to &s;ay Ma&s;ter of the Officers, who&s;e juri&s;diction reaches all Inferior Vice-Roys, Prefects, Governors of Provinces, and Judges. The other is called <HI>Dakaka Bellatenot-Gueta</HI> who comtroles the Hou&s;hold Servants, the Grooms and &s;uch like, who are ge|nerally of mean Condition, and of &s;everal Nations. Slaves al&s;o &s;et free are admitted to Dignities and Offices. For the Kings believe their Slaves, when freed, will be mo&s;t faithful, as owing to their Fortunes to none alive be&s;ides.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="96">Next in Dignity to the Court Officers, are the Vice-Roys, and Princes, Camp-Ma&s;ters, Senators, and Kings-Coun&s;el|lors, who are called the le&s;&s;er Judges and Magi&s;trates with|out any di&s;tinction of Superior or Inferior Judges: for they have equal Juri&s;diction and Cognizance of all Crimes.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the King's Camp.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Kings Tent de&s;cribed: The Camp pitch'd in great order. The &s;ame al|ways. It con&s;i&s;ts of four parts: formerly in <HI>Shewa,</HI> now in <HI>Dembea.</HI> How large. As it were a Marching City; the great Power of the Camp-Ma&s;ters.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHatever others have feign'd concerning any other Royal City or Metropolis, be&s;ides <HI>Axumas,</HI> are meer Fables. For the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> live continually in Tents, whether it be that they are not accu&s;tomed to Hou&s;es, or that their frequent Wars and tedious marches will not ad|mit of long re&s;t. The Kings Pavilion is a very large one, of white colour placed in the middle of the Camp; there being a large &s;pace of Ground left void round about it; as well to prevent the Ca&s;ualties of Fire, as al&s;o to receive the Hor&s;es of the Nobility and tho&s;e that bring Provi&s;ions. Next to him, the Grandees, the Friends and kindred of the <HI>King</HI> and the re&s;t of the Courtiers pitch up their Apartments. The whole Camp con&s;i&s;ts of four parts, every one of which has his Camp-Ma&s;ter. The fir&s;t part is call'd the <HI>Front;</HI> and the Camp-Ma&s;ter is call'd <HI>Fit-aurari.</HI> The Hindmo&s;t part is call'd <HI>Chuala.</HI> The Fir&s;t Camp-Ma&s;ter goes before to take up convenient Ground where there is &s;tore of Wood and Gra&s;s, chiefly near &s;ome River or Lake, to prevent want of Water. Having cho&s;en out his Ground; he fixes a Pole in the Earth with the Royal Banner at the Topp; upon the &s;ight whereof, they that mea&s;ure for the Nobility, &s;et up
<PB N="215" REF="96">
their Ma&s;ters Lodgings. After them the Common Soul|diery, and others that follow the Camp either for Victuals, or el&s;e upon bu&s;ine&s;s. And thus in a few hours time the whole Camp appears in the &s;ame Order as it was before. For every one knowes his place and his proportion, there being never any alteration of the Order, but the &s;ame Streets and Lanes, the &s;ame di&s;tance of Tents, &s;o that were it not for the variation of the Pro&s;pect, other Mountains, other Rivers, and another Face of the Country, you would think your &s;elf &s;till in the &s;ame place. When the Cryer has once proclaim'd the day of Removal, they pre&s;ently know how to pack up their Baggage, and in what order to march without any more ado; who are to march in the Front, who in the Rear; who on the Right, who on the Left hand: &s;o that all things are done without Noi&s;e or Tumult.</P>
<P>Neither is there any thing which more commends the In|du&s;try of the <HI>Abe&s;sines.</HI> For what they have acquir'd by long u&s;e and continual War, they &s;till retain; never pe&s;ter'd with confu&s;ion either marching or &s;itting &s;till. The con&s;tant di&s;po&s;al and largene&s;s of the Camp may be under&s;tood from hence, that the &s;ame Dialect and the &s;ame words continue in the &s;ame Streets and Quarters: in other Quarters another &s;ort of words, and a different Dialect: as for <HI>Dala,</HI> a word u&s;ed in the Front of the Camp, which &s;ignifies to <HI>put in;</HI> the Vulgar in the Rear Quarter &s;ay, <HI>Tshammara.</HI> Of old, before the <HI>Gallans</HI> conquer'd it, the Camp was pitch'd in <HI>Shewa,</HI> a fertile and mo&s;t plentiful Countrey. But for the mo&s;t part in <HI>December,</HI> and that for three or four years together in one place. In the beginning of <HI>Su&s;neus</HI>'s Reign in the year 1607, they pitch'd at <HI>Coga.</HI> Thence they remov'd to <HI>Gorgora,</HI> in the year 1612, from thence to <HI>Dancaza;</HI> and la&s;tly to <HI>Guen|dra</HI> which place, <HI>Bernier</HI> becau&s;e he had heard perhaps that it was the Re&s;idence of the King, calls the Metropolis of <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> of which perhaps in a few years there will be no|thing to be &s;een.</P>
<P>The&s;e Camps take up a va&s;t deal of room, as well in the Summer as in the Winter, for they do not onely contain the Souldiers, but their Wives and their Children, who&s;e work it is to bake their Bread, and make their Hydromel. So that the weak and helple&s;s multitude far exceeds the number of
<PB N="216" REF="97">
the Souldiery. Nor are they without Merchants and Trades|men of all &s;orts, be&s;ides Slaves and Lackeys, nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a Multitude: So that the Camp looks more like an Am|bulatory City, and moving Hou&s;es, then a Martial Camp. So many Tents and Pavilions &s;eeming a far off to repre|&s;ent the Pro&s;pect of &s;ome great Town. But le&s;s wonder|ful is that which is reported out of <HI>India;</HI> That near the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> there are certain Cities, if they may be &s;o call'd, which are always &s;wimming, and yet great Markets and Fairs are kept therein; and many People live there who have no other Country or Habitation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Military Affairs of the <HI>Habe&s;sines.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Continual war. The Winter cau&s;es a Truce. The <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> good Soldiers. Strong and active. They &s;erve without pay. They plunder the Countries as they march. The <HI>Gallans</HI> &s;ecur'd by their Poverty. The <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> igno|rant in Fire-Arms. Few Muskets, and fewer Musketeteers. Their Armies con&s;i&s;t mo&s;t of Foot. Light Armour. Drumms us'd by the Hor&s;e. Their Weapons. Bad Di&s;cipline: becau&s;e they count it no &s;hame to flie. Their On&s;ets furious. Their Rocks are their Fortre&s;&s;es. The King Commands in chief. Theives unpuni&s;h'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THat the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> are a Warlike People and continually exercis'd in War, we have already declar'd: neither is there any re&s;pit but what is caus'd by the Winter, at what time by rea&s;on of the Inundations of the Rivers, they are forc'd to be quiet. For they have neither Ships nor Boats: neither do they know how to make Bridges to com|mand a pa&s;&s;age over their violent Streams. Concerning which, <HI>Gregory</HI> wrote to me in the&s;e words.</P>
<P><HI>There is no making War in</HI> Ethiopia <HI>in the Winter time; neither does the Enemy attack us, nor we them; by rea&s;on of the great falls of Rain and the Inundations of the Rivers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tellezius</HI> al&s;o further te&s;tifies, That the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> are good Souldiers. They ride and manage a Hor&s;e well; and rea|dily take Arms; as well in obedience to their Soveraign, as for other cau&s;es already mention'd. They are &s;trong, They endure hunger and thri&s;t beyond belief, and with lit|tle &s;u&s;tenance can brook any un&s;ea&s;onable &s;ort of weather. They &s;erve without pay: contented with honour and ap|plau&s;e, and &s;uch Lands, as the King after the Roman Cu|&s;tom be&s;tows upon the well de&s;erving. Therefore they mu&s;t certainly be thought to &s;ight much more generou&s;ly and faithfully in the defence of their Countrey then Hire|lings. They expect no part of the Enemies Booty, nor no redemption, and therefore never &s;erve them in the Field. and becau&s;e they know not the art of protracting a War, therefore they never are &s;paring of them&s;elves to return home rich. However the Poverty of the Souldiers impo|veri&s;hes
<PB N="218" REF="98">
the Countries through which they march. For in regard it is a difficult thing to carry Provi&s;ions over &s;uch &s;teep and rugged Mountains, and long wayes, they take by force what is not freely given them; and by that means lay wa&s;t their own Countries no le&s;s then their Enemies: whereby the poor Countrey people are con&s;train'd to turn Souldiers, and &s;o taught to deal by others, as they were dealt with them|&s;elves. For which rea&s;on they neither can vanqui&s;h nor make any long pur&s;uit after the <HI>Gallans;</HI> who being retir'd with their Droves, the Pur&s;uers find nothing left behind but Lands untill'd, and empty Cottages. So invincible a Fortre&s;s is Poverty to with&s;tand the &s;toute&s;t Enemy. But, as we have &s;aid already, Tho&s;e <HI>Gallans</HI> might ea&s;ily be van|qui&s;h'd, did but the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> know the u&s;e of Muskets. <HI>Tel|lezius</HI> writes, that they have among them about fifteen hun|dred Mu&s;quets, but not above four Mu&s;queteers, and they but very bad Fire-men neither; neither do the Comman|ders know how to place and order them to the be&s;t advan|tage: and therefore after they have once di&s;charg'd, the Enemy ru&s;hes on &s;o furiou&s;ly before they can charge again, that they they are forc'd to to throw their Mu&s;quets away: and then another thing is; they have but very little Pow|der.</P>
<P>The bigge&s;t Army which the King brings now into the Field hardly amounts to Forty thou&s;and Men, among which he has not above Four or Five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, the re&s;t are all Foot. Their hor&s;es are couragious and mettle&s;ome, but they never get upon their backs till they are ready to charge the Enemy: at other times they ride their Mules, and lead their Hor&s;es. They are &s;lightly arm'd after the manner of the antient <HI>Velites;</HI> and tho their Stirrups are no bigger then onely to thru&s;t in their great Toes, lea&s;t if the Hor&s;e &s;hould fall, their feet &s;hould be hung in the Stirup, yet they &s;it ve|ry fa&s;t. Their Weapons are Swords and Darts, as al&s;o Launces and &s;hort Javelins, with which they fight at a di&s;tance; after which they di&s;pute it hand to hand with their Swords or Launces, and Bucklers. Their War like Mu&s;ick for the Hor&s;e are Drums much bigger then ours, and the King's, which are the bigge&s;t, go by the name of the <HI>Bear</HI> and the <HI>Lyon.</HI> Be&s;ides which, &s;everal Hornes and Fifes march before Him. They for the mo&s;t part, are
<PB N="219" REF="98">
arm'd with two Spears, of which they dart away the one at a di&s;tance, and maintain a clo&s;e fight with the other, de|fending them&s;elves with their Bucklers. The Hor&s;e never fight a foot, nor the Foot a hor&s;eback: a practice very nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a Country, where many times there is no u&s;e of Hor&s;e. In brief, the Military Di&s;cipline of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> is very irre|gular; rather the fault of the Captains that know not how to command them, than of the Souldiers. For they run away without any fear of Infamy or Puni&s;hment: neither do they know how to rally when they are once di&s;order'd; &s;o that the fir&s;t array being broken, the re&s;t are carry'd away like a Torrent: neither do they &s;trengthen their Wings with Re|&s;erves; neither do they &s;eparate the Veterans from the Raw Souldiers, di&s;heartning the Courage of the one, by the unequal mixture of the other. The fury of the fir&s;t On&s;et for the mo&s;t part wins the Field: for which rea&s;on, the <HI>Gallans</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> in heat and violence, have &s;o often vanqui&s;h'd them. They are not ea&s;ily per&s;waded to avoid the Combat, believing it &s;loathful and da&s;tardly to tire out an Enemy by delay, and wait for opportunities. Which has bin the Ruin of many of their Kings, that have joyn'd Battel with more Cou|rage, than Prudent Advice. The Kings them&s;elves, for the mo&s;t part bred up in the field, command their own Armies them&s;elves; or el&s;e they create a <HI>Ras,</HI> to command in their &s;tead.</P>
<P>One thing more remains behind, That this Country is ve|ry much infe&s;ted with Robbers as well as Enemies; who many times robb in Troops like Souldiers, and very much in|fe&s;t the Roads; and this without any &s;earching after, or care taken to puni&s;h them; by rea&s;on that the King and the Gover|nours being wholly bu&s;ied with continual Wars, have no time to ridd the Nation of the&s;e Vermin, who being pur&s;u'd, pre|&s;ently &s;helter them&s;elves among the Rocks and Mountains.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE &s;hall forbear to &s;et down over-ancient or incer|tain Relations, concerning the Expeditions of the Kings of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> into <HI>Egypt,</HI> in regard it does not ap|pear to us, what part of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> tho&s;e Writers mean; or how far the Empire of the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> of old extended. For tho&s;e things which Hi&s;torians have deliver'd to memory in refe|rence to the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> adjoyning upon <HI>Egypt,</HI> are not pre&s;ently to be apply'd to the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> For that the di&s;tance between <HI>Egypt</HI> and our <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> comprehends Eight or nine degrees, or a hunder'd <HI>German</HI> Miles and more. In which wide &s;pace, <HI>Nubia</HI> was &s;eated, &s;o that there might be Kings of other <HI>Ethi|opick</HI> Nations next to that. And therefore till we &s;ee the Hi&s;tories them&s;elves of the <HI>Abi&s;sines,</HI> we are unwilling to publi&s;h Incertainties for Certainties. But that the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> did make &s;everal Famous Expeditions into <HI>Arabia,</HI> is a thing not to be que&s;tion'd; in&s;omuch, that &s;ome of them have made a Computation of their Years from thence: and that the Kingdom of the <HI>Homerites</HI> was totally &s;ubdu'd by <HI>Caleb,</HI> we have already declar'd. To omit then &s;everal other Wars wag'd with their Neighbours, the Stories of which are to us unknown: as for example, that with the <HI>Nubians</HI> in the 25th Year of the former Century, recorded by <HI>Alvarez;</HI> the mo&s;t lamentable and mo&s;t fatal was that War which they enter'd
<PB N="221" REF="99">
into with the <HI>Adelans</HI> their Ancient Enemies. True it is in|deed, that in the beginning of his Raign, <HI>David</HI> vanqui&s;h'd them in &s;everal Battels. But after the <HI>Turks</HI> had vanqui&s;h'd <HI>Egypt,</HI> and &s;ome Ports of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the <HI>Adelans,</HI> &s;trengthen'd by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, turn'd the Scale of Fortune, and were al|ways Victors. For King <HI>Adelis</HI> &s;ent one <HI>Ahmed,</HI> a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> vulgarly call'd <HI>Grainus,</HI> or <HI>Grannus,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Left-handed,</HI> with an Army to invade <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> and revenge the Lo&s;&s;es of the <HI>Adelans.</HI> He, about the Year 1526, &s;ubdu'd all <HI>Fata|gara.</HI> For the fir&s;t two Years the War was carry'd on with various Succe&s;s; but the next Twelve Years to the Year 1540, at what time King <HI>David</HI> deceas'd, the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> had the wor&s;t of it. The King having lo&s;t the choice&s;t of his Kingdoms, and his Second Son <HI>Menas,</HI> who was taken Pri&s;oner, langui&s;h'd out the re&s;t of his days in the Rock <HI>Da|mus.</HI> And indeed the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> were brought to that low and mi&s;erable Condition, that they began to de&s;pair of their Countrey. For &s;uch are the Lamentations which we find made by tho&s;e that liv'd at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the Epilogue printed after the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Not without rea&s;on do we weep, when we call to mind the Captivity of our Brethren, our Countrey layd wa&s;t, Our Temples Burnt, our Books and our Sanctuaries con&s;um'd with Fire, and the Profanation of our Mona&s;teries by that wicked and impious</HI> Grainus, <HI>a Companion for Goats, a Per&s;cutor and Invader of the Sheep, from</HI> Waigaci, <HI>to the Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Cau&s;es of &s;uch a Torrent of Calamities, the&s;e may be reck'nd not to be the lea&s;t: for that the King, van|qui&s;h'd by his own &s;luggi&s;h humour, had given him&s;elf whol|ly up to the Temptations of Plea&s;ure; &s;o dedicated to Wo|men, that he permitted &s;ome of them to have their Idols in his Palace. Next, the <HI>Turks,</HI> out of their inbred hatred to Chri&s;tianity, had &s;upply'd their <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Friend with Fire-Arms, and &s;uch as knew well how to u&s;e them; who&s;e Thunder, then by the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> fir&s;t heard, they were not able to endure; nor did they know how to cure the Wounds which the Bullets made, as not being accu&s;tom'd to them: be&s;ides, that on the other &s;ide, the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> &s;o nu|merou&s;ly abounding throughout <HI>Abe&s;sinia,</HI> favourably every where entertain'd tho&s;e of their own Sect. Many al&s;o of
<PB N="222" REF="100">
the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> them&s;elves, following, as is u&s;ual, the Fortune of the Victor, for&s;ook their Native Soveraign: So that now every thing threaten'd utter de&s;truction and de&s;olation, when the King, lurking among the Rocks, began to bethink him|&s;elf of craving Succour from the <HI>Portugals.</HI> To that purpo&s;e in the Year 1535, one <HI>John Bermudes,</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> was &s;ent. Who fir&s;t arriv'd at <HI>Rome</HI> in the Year 1538, where he was made Patriarch joyntly of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and after|wards went into <HI>Portugal</HI> in the Year 1539, and there ob|tain'd a Commi&s;&s;ion from <HI>John</HI> the Third, to the Vice-Roy of <HI>India,</HI> to &s;end A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Abe&s;sines.</HI> Their Commander was <HI>Chri&s;topher Gomez,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Valour, who in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1541, enter'd the Kingdom with Six &s;mall Field-Pieces, and Four hundred and fifty Mu&s;que|teers. At fir&s;t they had a very &s;evere March: for they wanted Hor&s;es and Teams: the Country being &s;o wa&s;ted, that they were forc'd to carry their Luggage and Convenien|cies upon their &s;houlders over mo&s;t rugged and &s;teep Moun|tains. Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e Souldiers, few in number, but all choice men, and coveting the honour to re&s;tore the King of <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> to his Kingdom and his Liberty, patiently under|went all &s;orts of hard&s;hip. This caus'd a change of Fortune, &s;o that now the late Victors were every where put to flight, a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Execution of the Guns. In the fir&s;t place, <HI>Gomez</HI> a&s;&s;ail'd the Rock <HI>Amba-Sanet,</HI> which was thought in|vincible, and forc'd the Enemy to quit it. Whereby he won to him&s;elf great Fame, and highly Encourag'd the <HI>Habe&s;sines.</HI> Fir&s;t therefore the Kings Mother, confiding in this &s;mall Force, left a certain Rock, which gave acce&s;s to none, nor permitted any to a&s;cend, but as they were drawn up or let down with Ropes, and chear'd them with her pre&s;ence. <HI>Claudius,</HI> who lay &s;culking in the Kingdom of <HI>Shewa,</HI> had writ word he would be &s;uddainly with them, but dur&s;t not adven|ture through &s;o many Numbers of the Enemies that lay in the way. So that <HI>Gomez</HI> with &s;ome few of the <HI>Habe&s;sinians,</HI> was con&s;train'd to bear the whole burthen of the War with a mo&s;t incredible Courage. The <HI>Barbarians</HI> were not ignorant of the Gallantry of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> nor did they believe their own People had hearts &s;ufficient to with&s;tand the Fury of the great Guns. And therefore thinking it convenient as well to try the Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Gomez,</HI> as to &s;pie what Force he had, they &s;ent certain Commi&s;&s;ioners to him, pretending to blame
<PB N="223" REF="100">
blame his ra&s;hne&s;s, and to offer him &s;afe Conduct, as being deceiv'd by the <HI>Abe&s;sines,</HI> if he thought fit to return. But <HI>Gomeus,</HI> as it were provok'd with the indignity they had put upon him, gave them an an&s;wer that favour'd both of fierce|ne&s;s and contempt, telling them, <HI>That he was &s;ent by the mo&s;t Potent King of the</HI> Portugals, <HI>to revenge the Injuries done to the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ines; <HI>and that his coming was not to return again, but to fight</HI> Grainus. The Enemies Force in that place was 15000 Foot, and 1500 Hor&s;e, together with 200 <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Mu&s;que|teers, whom <HI>Gomeus</HI> had mo&s;t rea&s;on to fear. But he confi|ding in the Courage of his own men, tho but a &s;mall parcel, re&s;olv'd upon a Battel. However, he keeps within his Camp. On the other &s;ide, <HI>Grainus</HI> would not &s;tir, well knowing the <HI>Portugals</HI> had Provi&s;ion but for a few days; which being &s;pent, they would be forc'd to for&s;ake the Hill where they lay En|camp'd, and &s;o might be ea&s;ily environ'd by his Numbers. Nor did that cunning in part fail the <HI>Barbarian;</HI> for the <HI>Por|tugals</HI> were forc'd to for&s;ake their Camp, but could not be &s;ur|rounded by the Enemy, in regard their Field-Pieces and Mu&s;|quets &s;truck &s;uch a Terror into the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> that they, contemning all Orders of their Captain, would not &s;tir. And it &s;o happen'd, that <HI>Grainus</HI> him&s;elf, riding about to force his men on, was wounded in the Hips with a Mu&s;quet Bullet, and had his Hor&s;e &s;hot under him. The fall of the Captain quite damp'd the Courage of the Souldiers; &s;o that they pre|&s;ently retreated, and the <HI>Portugals</HI> keeping the Field, look'd upon them&s;elves as Victors. Twelve days after the <HI>Barba|rians</HI> renew'd the Fight, for which the <HI>Portugals</HI> were pre|par'd. While both &s;ides fought at fir&s;t with equal Succe&s;s, an Accident happen'd, lamentable in &s;ight, but yet the cau&s;e of the Victory. For while the Souldiers went with their lighted Matches to fetch Powder, a Barrel took fire, the noi&s;e of which &s;o terrify'd the <HI>Barbarians</HI> Hor&s;es, that their Riders not being able to rule them, they di&s;order'd the Body of the Army; which the <HI>Portugals</HI> ob&s;erving, lay'd all their force upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> who being put to flight, the re&s;t ea&s;ily fol|low'd. However, they could not pur&s;ue them far, becau&s;e they had but Eight Hor&s;es. Neverthele&s;s the Enemies Camp was taken and plunder'd. This was the work of that Sum|mer: for the Winter coming on, put an end to farther Action. The Winter now declining, the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who thought no|thing too difficult for them to undertake, attack'd another
<PB N="224" REF="101">
&s;teep Rock in <HI>Samen,</HI> call'd the <HI>Jews Rock,</HI> which was kept by the <HI>Adelans,</HI> with a Garri&s;on of 1500 men. For it was large, and contain'd many Fields, Meadows, Fountains and Streams. The attempt was occa&s;ion'd by a <HI>Jew,</HI> who had bin formerly Governor of the Rock, who hearing of the Courage of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> advis'd the taking of it, in regard there were ma|ny Hor&s;es in it, which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> principally wanted: and the more to encourage them, he promis'd to &s;hew them &s;uch by-ways, that they might be able to &s;urprize the Garri|&s;on; adding withal, That there would be no &s;afe Pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Claudius,</HI> &s;o long as the Enemy held that Pa&s;s. <HI>Gomez</HI> under&s;tanding by the Queen that the <HI>Jew</HI> &s;pake truth, un|dertook the Enterprize with pro&s;perous Succe&s;s: for having &s;lain all the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> he got a Booty there of Four&s;core brave Hor&s;es, Three hundred Mules, &s;everal Slaves, and other good Plunder be&s;ide. After which he re&s;tor'd the Rock to the <HI>Jews,</HI> under&s;tanding they had always bin faithful to the <HI>Habe&s;sines.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while <HI>Grainus</HI> finding there was no good to be done again&s;t the <HI>Portugals</HI> without Guns and Fire-Arms, &s;ent for immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Neighbouring <HI>Turks,</HI> and petty Ba&s;ha's of <HI>Arabia.</HI> So that he obtain'd from the Ba&s;haw of <HI>Zebid</HI> a fre&s;h Supply of Seven hundred, &s;ome &s;ay, Nine hundred Mu&s;queteers, and Ten Field-Pieces. Some noble <HI>Arabians</HI> al&s;o that were his Friends came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Gomez,</HI> either knowing nothing of this, or el&s;e heighten'd by his two former Victories, never &s;taying for <HI>Claudius,</HI> as he ought to have done; in regard he delayed &s;omewhat longer than was expected, nor yet tarrying for &s;ome of the <HI>Portugals</HI> who brought Hor&s;es along with them: Or whether it were, that he was con&s;train'd to it, as having no place of Retreat, and did not believe that <HI>Grainus</HI> him&s;elf would appear before the Winter was over, gave the Enemy the opportunity of a Battel. But being over-powr'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> he was wound|ed with a Mu&s;quet Bullet in the Thigh. He him&s;elf, having lo&s;t many of his own Souldiers, and the &s;toute&s;t of his Com|manders, by the help of the Night e&s;cap'd to a Rock. The wounded and weary were all &s;lain, the re&s;t di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves into the Woods, while the Camp became a Prey to the Enemy. Fourteen only accompanied <HI>Gamez,</HI> the mo&s;t of them wounded; who void of all a&s;&s;i&s;tance, without food or medicaments, refre&s;h'd them&s;elves by the Fountains
<PB N="225" REF="101">
which afforded but &s;mall relief. There they were appre|hended by the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and carried to <HI>Grainus</HI> ex|ulting for joy of his Succe&s;s. He cau&s;ing about a hundred of the heads of the <HI>Portuguezes</HI> to be brought and laid down before him, upbraided <HI>Gomez</HI> for his madne&s;s in undertaking a War again&s;t him: and then after he had receiv'd a &s;tern an&s;wer from his Captive, caus'd him to be tormented to death.</P>
<P>After that misfortune, the King came up, &s;ad for the lo&s;s of <HI>Gomez,</HI> whom he de&s;ired mo&s;t earne&s;tly to have beheld with his Eyes. Nor were they le&s;s &s;ad to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance he came, as well for the lo&s;s they had receiv'd, as becau&s;e he had brought &s;o few Forces with him. Therefore they lay &s;till three or four months, till they could rai&s;e more. They being come, the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who were now reduc'd to a hundred and twenty, and yet zealous to revenge the death of their Captain, were very urgent with the King to fight, giving him great hopes of Victory. For they had intelli|gence that the <HI>Turks</HI> were return'd home, leaving only two hundred behind them: whether by Command of their <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ha,</HI> or taking it ill that <HI>Gomez</HI> was not deliver'd to them. The King, though he had not above Eight thou&s;and Foot, and Five hundred Hor&s;e, re&s;olv'd to follow the Inclinations of the <HI>Portugals.</HI> And fir&s;t in a &s;light skirmi&s;h he routed &s;ome of the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Forces that marched before; Then &s;ets upon <HI>Grainus</HI> him&s;elf, who led an Army of 13000 men, and vanqui&s;h'd him; <HI>Grainus</HI> him&s;elf, the Terror of <HI>Habe&s;si|nia</HI> for &s;o many years, was &s;hot with a Musket Bullet by a <HI>Portugueze,</HI> who reveng'd the death of his Captain. All the <HI>Turks</HI> but fourteen were &s;lain. The head of <HI>Grainus</HI> was expo&s;ed to the view of the People in &s;everal Provinces and Kingdoms of <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> to the great comfort of the behold|ers. For upon the &s;ight of it, the <HI>Abi&s;sines</HI> recover'd Vigour and Courage; They congratulated their Kings Succe&s;s; and they who had revolted, return'd to their duty, pretend|ing nece&s;&s;ity for the fault committed. The King con&s;ider|ing the condition of tho&s;e times, thought it convenient to par|don all, to confirm the wavering, to win the hearts of his People by Clemency, to rally his &s;catter'd Forces, and to do all tho&s;e things which were nece&s;&s;ary for the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of his Kingdom.

There was &s;till a greater fear of the <HI>Adelans,</HI> who having in time repair'd their Lo&s;&s;es, onely waited an Opportunity to make a New Inva&s;ion.

<P>AT what time the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> making &s;everal Voyages into <HI>India,</HI> made War upon &s;everal Nations, their fame reach'd the <HI>Abe&s;sinians</HI> al&s;o; who glad that the Power of the <HI>Saracens</HI> was brought low, and that <HI>Egypt</HI> and their Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> was re&s;tor'd to freedom, were in hopes that the Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> would be open.

who carry'd them to <HI>Bononia,</HI> and made a long Di&s;cour&s;e of the Re&s;pect and Reverence which the Kings of <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> had to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI> They were read before <HI>Clement</HI> the Seventh, and the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, with the general Applau&s;e of the Court of <HI>Rome;</HI> but with no Succe&s;s. For that <HI>Claudius</HI> the King plainly deny'd to ratifie either tho&s;e things, or what <HI>John Bermudes</HI> afterwards related at <HI>Rome</HI> to the &s;ame effect; as if never given in Command, nor &s;o under|&s;tood, but that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Emba&s;&s;ie, and con&s;equent|ly the Letters them&s;elves had bin faign'd and contriv'd by the <HI>Portugals.</HI> However, the <HI>Habe&s;sinians</HI> being reduc'd to very great &s;treights, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bermudes,</HI> had an a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Four hunder'd and fifty men granted, and &s;ent into <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> by the Command of <HI>John</HI> the Third.

Of which Con&s;ultation there had certainly bin no need, if the King had Commanded the Supply before. However it were, that Succour was not onely very nece&s;&s;ary, but very advantageous to the <HI>Habes&s;ines.</HI> From which time the <HI>Ha|be&s;sines</HI> were not onely gratefully, but honourably receiv'd among the <HI>Habe&s;sines:</HI> nor did they then refu&s;e the <HI>Latin</HI> Religion, but frequently went to the <HI>Portugueze</HI> Chappels, and admitted Them into Theirs. Moreover, they al&s;o gave Liberty to the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> Women that were marry'd to the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> to go to Ma&s;s with their Husbands, and to par|take of the &s;ame Ceremonies with them. So that during the Raign of <HI>Claudius,</HI> there was great Hopes both at <HI>Rome</HI> and at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that the <HI>Habe&s;sinians</HI> might be per&s;waded to embrace the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion. But that Hope proving vain, there was for &s;ome time a Ce&s;&s;ation of Emba&s;&s;ies, and the <HI>Abe&s;si|nian</HI> Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Lu&s;itanians</HI> was almo&s;t interrupted; untill by the Artifices of the Fathers of the Society, the Minds of the later Kings were &s;omewhat more inclinably di&s;pos'd to give Obedience to the See of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Upon that, Letters were written to the Pope and the King
<PB N="230" REF="104">
of <HI>Spain,</HI> who was then al&s;o King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and an&s;wers upon them, which gave an Occa&s;ion to <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> to decree an Emba&s;&s;ie into <HI>Europe.</HI> To that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;takenly <HI>Tecur-Egzy</HI> in <HI>Tellezius,</HI> l. 2. c. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Fecur-Egzie</HI> was cho&s;en, and with him <HI>Antonie Fernandez</HI> was joyn'd; who were commanded by unknown and by-ways to Travel <HI>Southward,</HI> till they reach'd <HI>Melinda,</HI> upon the Shore of the <HI>Indian Ocean,</HI> from whence the Pa&s;&s;age was more Ea&s;ie and Safe into <HI>India.</HI> Thereupon &s;etting forth out of <HI>Gojam,</HI> they Travell'd through <HI>Enarea,</HI> from thence into the Kingdom of <HI>Zendero,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Cambata,</HI> the La&s;t Kingdom under the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Dominions. Thence Travelling into <HI>Alaba,</HI> they were forbid to go any farther, by the Governour of the Pro|vince, who was a <HI>Mahumetan.</HI> He apprehended the Emba&s;|&s;ador with his Train; and had not the Law of Nations bin of &s;ome force among the <HI>Barbarians</HI> (for they had about them to &s;hew both their Letters and Pre&s;ents from the Emperour) they had bin put to death, with the Law in their own hands. Being by that means &s;et at Liberty, after a Years and &s;even Months time &s;pent in hard Travel, after many &s;ad Experien|ces of Savage Barbarity and a Thou&s;and Jeopardies, they return'd home without effecting any thing. Nor can any rea&s;on be certainly given, why tho&s;e unknown and dange|rous Ways were cho&s;en, thorough &s;o many Barbarous Na|tions, &s;o many Wild and De&s;ert Countries, when the Road lay &s;o plain through the Kingdom of <HI>Denoale</HI> in Friend&s;hip with the <HI>Abi&s;sines,</HI> to the Port of <HI>Baylur,</HI> which the Patriarch of <HI>Portugal</HI> afterwards &s;ecurely made u&s;e of: as if &s;o tedious a Journey had bin impos'd upon the Undertakers, not &s;o much to go upon an Emba&s;&s;ie, as for the Di&s;covery of For|raign Countries, and By-Roads, for the Direction of Travel|lers.</P>
<P>After that, there happening a difference between them and the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> all manner of Commerce and Communi|cation with the <HI>Europeans</HI> ceas'd: In&s;omuch, that now they would with great reluctancy admit tho&s;e whom before they &s;o highly admir'd, and with great difficulty would di&s;mi&s;s, out of their affection to Arts and Sciences; e&s;pecially, if they &s;u&s;pected them to be Clergy-men, or under Religious Vows.

<P>Otherwi&s;e, they rarely &s;end any Emba&s;&s;adors abroad, un|le&s;s it be into <HI>Egypt,</HI> when they have need of the Metropoli|tan.

Therefore the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> accompt them|&s;elves onely Lords; all others they look upon as Servants: in that particular not &s;paring their Brothers or their Kindred.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of their Judiciary Proceedings and Puni&s;hments.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Their Judicial Proceedings very plain. Witne&s;&s;es &s;lightly and cur&s;orily exa|min'd. Appeals rare. Their Puni&s;hments, Stoning, Drubbing, and Ba|ni&s;hment. Homicides how puni&s;hed. A Di&s;cour&s;e of Like for Like.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe manner of their Judicial Proceedings is very plain and ordinary. For all Controver&s;ies are determin'd by word of Mouth, without any noi&s;e of Proce&s;s, without any Writs, or Writings, of which the mo&s;t part of the Nation is ignorant. The Plaintiff has liberty to produce his Witne&s;|&s;es, which the Defendant may refu&s;e, if he have any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect them But in regard of their ignorance of the true Proceedings by way of Interrogatory and proof, nor under|&s;tand how to examin a Witne&s;s, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity follow, That Ju&s;tice is but ill admini&s;ter'd, where the Witne&s;&s;es are &s;o cur&s;orily heard. It is lawful to appeal from Inferiour Sentences either to the King or the Court-Tribunals: but that is &s;eldom done; by rea&s;on of the Poverty of the People, and the tediou&s;ne&s;s of Travelling: and partly out of the Little hopes they have of redre&s;s. For the Governours and Judges of Provinces are offended with appeals, as &s;eeming to them an accu&s;ation of Inju&s;tice; and therefore the wrong'd Parties fearing their di&s;plea&s;ure, rather choo&s;e to lo&s;e their right, than the favour of the Judges. Neither does the re|&s;igning of Office afford any relief again&s;t an unju&s;t Sentence. For either through Favour or for Money they obtain a Par|don for all things done ami&s;s in their Magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>Among the &s;orts of Puni&s;hments inflicted upon Offenders, be&s;ides <HI>Beheading</HI> and <HI>Hanging,</HI> the mo&s;t ready at hand is <HI>Stoning</HI> to death: the Soyl affording &s;ufficient materials for that &s;ort of Execution. The next is <HI>Drubbing,</HI> if the Crime be not Capital.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="108">The puni&s;hment of the Nobility, is Exilement into the <HI>Zanic</HI> Lake, or into their high and &s;teep Rocks, which are in a manner like Ilands; from whence however they frequent|ly e&s;cape by rea&s;on that the People are ea&s;ily corrupted by Bribery.</P>
<P>Homicides are deliver'd up to the next of<NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot">A Cu&s;tome &s;till us'd in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as you may read in <HI>Tavernier</HI> and <HI>Olearius.</HI></NOTE> Kin to the Party murder'd, at who&s;e free will it is, to pardon the Male|factors, &s;ell them to forraign Merchants, or put them to what death they plea&s;e. If the Homicide e&s;cape unknown, the Inhabitants of the place and all the Neighbourhood are ob|lig'd to pay a Fine; by which means many Murthers are ei|ther prevented or di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t certainly the Law of <HI>Like for Like,</HI> was always and &s;till is accompted the mo&s;t ju&s;t, and plaine&s;t among &s;everal Nations.

And it &s;eems unju&s;t to &s;urrender the Offender to the Malice and Fury of the Offended Party, when they may have unbya&s;s'd Jud|ges, to give Sentence without Favour or Affection.</P>

<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Abi&s;&s;ines</HI> corrupt: and why.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw we proceed to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Habe&s;sinians,</HI> then which there is not any other more corrupt. For whatever we find &s;catter'd in our Re|lations, were neither collected out of the Books which are publickly authentic in <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> nor taken from the report of any per&s;ons there skill'd in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs of that Country, but partly ill related through the Ra&s;hne&s;s of the Writers them&s;elves; partly by the &s;ame per&s;ons or others ill under&s;tood through their ignorance of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lan|guage.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="109">The fir&s;t Relation concerning the Religion of the <HI>Habe&s;|&s;ines,</HI> was &s;et forth by <HI>Damianus</HI> a <HI>Goez,</HI> a noble <HI>Lu&s;itanian,</HI> from the Report of <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> Fir&s;t <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which Narrative of his<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In a little Treati&s;e often quoted,</HI> Of the Emba&s;&s;ie of the Great Emperor of the <HI>Indians.</HI></NOTE> contains many things ambiguous, many other things alto|gether fal&s;e.

Certainly <HI>Gregory</HI> was very much offended with him; And when he heard his following Doctrines,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Je&s;us Chri&s;t was the Son of the Father, and the beginning of him&s;elf: in the &s;ame manner that the Holy Gho&s;t, was the Spirit of him&s;elf, and proceeded from the Father and the Son.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That he de&s;cended into Hell where was the Soul of</HI> Adam, <HI>and Chri&s;t him&s;elf, which Soul of</HI> Adam <HI>Chri&s;t received from the Virgin</HI> Mary: and toward the latter end of the Book, <HI>That Chri&s;t de|&s;cended into Hell for the Soul of</HI> Adam <HI>and not for his own.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the Souls of men piou&s;ly deceas'd are not crucify'd in Pur|gatory upon the Sabaoth and Lords Day.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That by the Decree and Commandment of Queen</HI> Maqueda <HI>the Women were al&s;o to be Circumcis'd, as having a certain glandulous piece of Fle&s;h, not unfit to receive the Impre&s;sion and mark of Circum|ci&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay, when <HI>Tellezius</HI> heard the&s;e things, and many other of the &s;ame mixture, in no &s;mall heat and Pa&s;&s;ion, he cry'd out, <HI>That they were Fictions, Dreams, nay meer Lyes:</HI> frequently repeating the&s;e words; <HI>If he &s;aid this, he was a Bea&s;t of the Field.</HI></P>
<P>Yet out of the&s;e Books mo&s;t of tho&s;e Stories have flow'd, which our Writers have made public, concerning the Reli|gion
<PB N="240" REF="110">
of the <HI>Abe&s;sines.</HI> But the Fathers of the Society, having bin conver&s;ant &s;o long in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> and view'd the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Books, after &s;everal Di&s;putations and Di&s;cour&s;es with them, have bin able to afford us more Truth, who&s;e Acts and Wri|tings being free for the peru&s;al of <HI>Tellezius,</HI> we &s;hall cull the choice&s;t of his accurate Relations, and what he has reported more ambiguous or more partially, out of his di&s;like of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, we &s;hall correct out of their own Wri|tings, or from the Di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Gregory</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Certainly to Chri&s;tians, no Hi&s;tory can be more plea&s;ant than that of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs; e&s;pecially if we look back to the Primitive Church. For whom would it not ravi&s;h into a high admiration of the wonderful Providence of God as well in founding as pre&s;erving his Church? when he &s;hall con&s;ider that it grew up, and increas'd, not by the Propaga|tion of Arms or human Arts, but by the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Hea|theni&s;h per&s;ecution. To whom can it be unplea&s;ing to con|&s;ider with a Pious Contemplation, the undaunted Courage of the Martyrs, the Con&s;tancy of her Doctors, the Sincerity of the Chri&s;tian People, the Purity of the Faith, the Strife of Good Works, the Patience of the Weak, the plainne&s;s of the Rites and Ceremonies? Which when they once began to be alter'd, with the reverence to the Church be it &s;poken, then al&s;o enter'd in Pride in&s;tead of Mode&s;ty, Ambition in&s;tead of Charity, together with Faction and Contention. As if our lei&s;ure and our Quiet were therefore granted us by Heaven to con&s;ume that time in making Scrutinies into all the mi&s;te|ries of Faith, and moving &s;uch impertinent Que&s;tions, which ought to be &s;pent in exerci&s;es of Charity and Piety.</P>
<P>But I return to the Religion of the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> concerning the Original of which, there are various Opinions of &s;undry Authors. They that admit the Tradition of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> concerning Queen <HI>Maqueda,</HI> are of Opinion, that the <HI>Abe&s;|&s;ines</HI> had the true knowledge of God, ever &s;ince the Raign of King <HI>Salomon,</HI> and that their Judaic Rites, &s;uch as <HI>Circumci|&s;ion, abstaining from meats forbidden, Ob&s;ervation of the Sabboth, Marriage of the Brothers Wife, and the like,</HI> had their Original from thence. But in regard the&s;e things were commonly practis'd as well in other Nations, as among the Primitive Nations, who conform'd to the <HI>Jews</HI> in &s;everal things, It is not a thing to be ea&s;ily affirm'd, that the&s;e were the foot|&s;teps of tho&s;e Ceremonies receiv'd &s;o many Ages before from

<P><HI>But as to what relates to the Eating of Swines Fle&s;h, we are not for|bid it, out of regard to the ob&s;ervance of the Mo&s;aic Law, as the</HI> Jews <HI>were.

<P>However they ab&s;tain from blood and things &s;trangl'd, not out of any ob&s;ervance of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, but an Apo&s;tolic Decree always in force in the Ea&s;tern Church: which was al&s;o for many Ages ob&s;erv'd in the We&s;tern Church, and re|viv'd in &s;ome Councils. They al&s;o rebuke us, for that we &s;uffer'd that Decree to be laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>Nor do they allow the <HI>Jews</HI> Sabboth out of a re&s;pect to Judai&s;m, or that they learnt it from &s;ome certain Nations that kept the Seventh day holy. But becau&s;e the ancient Cu&s;tom of the Primitive Church, who ob&s;erv'd that day per|haps out of complacency to the <HI>Jews,</HI> being long retain'd in the Ea&s;t, was at length carry'd into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For thus we find it written in &s;ome <HI>ancient Con&s;titutions</HI> which they call the Con&s;titutions of the Apo&s;tles.</P>
<P><HI>Let the Servants labour five days, but let them keep the Holydays, the Sabboth, and the Lords Day in the Church for the &s;ake of Pious In&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P>The Council of <HI>Laodicea</HI> decreed that the Go&s;pels with other parts of Scripture &s;hould be read upon the Sabboth; when before the Paragraphs of the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> were onely read upon the Sabboth, and the <HI>Go&s;pels</HI> upon the Sunday: the Texts of the old Law being thought mo&s;t agreeable to the Old Sabboth, and the Texts of the New Te&s;tament, to the New Sabboth.</P>
<P><HI>Socrates</HI> al&s;o farther te&s;tifies that the People us'd to a&s;&s;emble at Church upon the Sabboth and Lords Day.</P>

<P>But <HI>Claudius</HI> makes &s;o much difference between both days, that he prefers the Lords day before the Sabaoth.</P>
<P><HI>But as to what pertains to our Celebration of the ancient Sabaoth, we do not celebrate it, as the Jews did, who Crucify'd Christ, &s;aying,</HI> Let his blood be upon Us and our Children. <HI>For tho&s;e Jews neither draw water, nor kindle fires, nor dre&s;s meat, nor bake bread; neither do they go from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. But we &s;o celebrate it, that we administer the Sacrament, and relieve the Poor and the Widow, as our Fathers the Apo&s;tles commanded Us. We Celebrate it as the Sa|baoth of the fir&s;t Holiday, which is a new day of which</HI> David <HI>&s;aith,</HI> This is the day which the Lord made, let us rejoyce and ex|ult therein. <HI>For upon that day our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t ro&s;e: and upon that day the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended upon the Apo&s;tles in the Ora|tory of Sion.

<P><HI>Gregory</HI> al&s;o te&s;tify'd, That the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> ab&s;tain from no &s;ort of Labour upon the Sabaoth, but from the mo&s;t &s;ervile &s;orts of Labour. This Cu&s;tom continu'd long in the Church, till it was abrogated by degrees; for by the 22^d <HI>Canon</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Laodicea</HI> the Chri&s;tians are forbid to work upon the Sabaoth. Neverthele&s;s the Sacred Lectures were con|tinu'd for a time, as appears by the Canon above mention'd, till at length tho&s;e were al&s;o left off; perhaps becau&s;e that the People having a licence to work, there were but few that repair'd to Church.</P>
<P>Moreover, according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> it is law|ful in <HI>Abe&s;sinia</HI> to marry the Widow of the Brother deceas'd, as <HI>Alvarez</HI> te&s;tifies.

However, that &s;uch Wives are al&s;o prohibited from coming to the Holy Communion, wherein <HI>Alvarez</HI> agrees with him.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> attributed to Queen <HI>Candace</HI>'s Eunuch; but contrary to authentic Hi&s;tories. <HI>Candace</HI> no <HI>Habe&s;&s;inian.</HI> Other Traditions nothing better. Demon&s;trated when, and by whom: To which the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Axuma</HI> agrees. The Rea&s;ons of doubting and deciding, <HI>Frumentius</HI> how call'd. His Encomium. <HI>Cedrenus</HI> and <HI>Nicephorus</HI> refuted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is the Common Fame among the <HI>Europeans,</HI> That the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Faith was be|gun by that <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Eunuch, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.27. And perhaps the <HI>Habe&s;|&s;ines</HI> them&s;elves, believing it to be for their Honour, were the authors of the Story: confiding in the Credit of the Book of <HI>Axuma,</HI> where, the &s;ame hi&s;tory is &s;et down as in the <HI>Acts of the Apostles,</HI> and without any other Circum&s;tances: by which it may &s;eem this &s;tory had not its fir&s;t original among them, but was tran&s;crib'd. Neither was <HI>Tzagazaabus</HI> better inform'd, as appears by his Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith. Neverthele&s;s it &s;eems very &s;trange, that King <HI>David</HI> &s;hould either a&s;&s;ert or give his a&s;&s;ent to <HI>Alvarez</HI> a&s;&s;erting the &s;ame thing: whereas the Cre|dit as well of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> as <HI>Greek</HI> Hi&s;tory ab&s;olutely tells us the contrary. Some endeavour a Reconciliation of this dif|ference, as if the fir&s;t dawnings of Chri&s;tianity, tho but very dark and ob&s;cure, began at that time fir&s;t to glimmer. But then this &s;hould have bin demon&s;trated by &s;olid Rea&s;ons rela|ting not onely to the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Nation in general, but to the <HI>Habe&s;sinians</HI> in particular. Whereas the Te&s;timonies which we &s;hall cite by and by do not &s;peak of the Conver&s;ion of tho&s;e that were half Chri&s;tians before, but either of the <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Heathens.</HI> For we have already &s;hew'd that <HI>Candaces</HI> was never Queen of the <HI>Habe&s;sines.</HI> Neither is her Proper Name <HI>Laca&s;a,</HI> which we find in the Vulgar Catalogues to be found in <HI>Tellezius.</HI> For <HI>Hhendaqe,</HI> or <HI>Hindaqe,</HI> is a quite different word from <HI>Candace,</HI> from whence others ca&s;ting away the A&s;pirate, derive the name <HI>Judith:</HI> others, as if they would correct the Error, have &s;train'd it to <HI>Judith.</HI> Nor was the name of <HI>Can|dace</HI> ever known to the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> tho familiar to the Inha|bitants
<PB N="250" REF="114">
of <HI>Meroe.</HI> Others refer the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Ha|be&s;sines</HI> not to <HI>Candace</HI>'s Eunuch, but to the times of the Apo&s;tles, and particularly a&s;cribe it to St. <HI>Bartholmew:</HI> others to St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> or becau&s;e there is no &s;uch thing to be found in his life, to St. <HI>Matthias.</HI> Of all which Fancies the <HI>Habe&s;|&s;ines</HI> knew nothing, who hearing &s;uch Whim&s;eys from our Countreymen, not without rea&s;on an&s;wer'd, <HI>That perhaps tho&s;e things were to be understood of the Lower</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>that lyes between</HI> Aba&s;&s;ia <HI>and</HI> Egypt. However we can never find out what the Succe&s;s of tho&s;e Apo&s;tles Preaching was: what Kings or People with&s;tood that Conver&s;ion: what Pa&s;tors, what Ce|remonies, what Books they made u&s;e of: what form of Di&s;ci|pline, or what was the Doctrine of that time. Concerning all which things, in regard there is &s;o deep a &s;ilence, we can|not acknowledg any &s;uch beginnings of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion in <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI></P>
<P>However this is certain, That both the <HI>Habe&s;sine, Grecian,</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers, E&s;pecially <HI>Ruffinus</HI> and his followers, agree with one con&s;ent, That the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Ethiopian,</HI> hap|pen'd in the time of St. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria</HI> un|der <HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, about the Year of Chri&s;t 330. or not long after, and that in this manner. One <HI>Meropius,</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Tyre, (Ruffinus</HI> calls him a Philo&s;opher) intending for <HI>India,</HI> put into Harbour upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> in the Red Sea, which at that time was al&s;o call'd the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea. There dy|ing, or, as <HI>Ruffinus</HI> will have it, &s;lain by the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> he left two Young men, <HI>Frumentius</HI> and <HI>Ade&s;ius, Fremonatum</HI> and <HI>Sy|dracum,</HI> the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> call them, who being taken and brought to the King, became highly favour'd and care&s;s'd by rea&s;on of their Ingenuity and Indu&s;try; and at length being made free of the Country, were preferr'd by the King to keep his Books and Papers. The King dying, they remain'd in the &s;ame Imployment under the Queen Regent, till the Young King came of age.</P>
<P>All this while they entertain'd the Chri&s;tian Merchants that Traffick'd into tho&s;e Parts, with all kindne&s;s, and did them all the good offices Imaginable, and made them&s;elves &s;o remarkable for their Vertue and their Integrity among tho&s;e Nations, that the Chri&s;tian Religion was highly e&s;teem'd by all. Which foundation being laid, <HI>Frumentius</HI> took a Journey to St. <HI>Athana&s;ius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and was by Him, for his great parts, and Con&s;tancy in the Faith,

created the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Thereupon returning into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he initiated the Inhabitants in the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion by Bapti&s;me, then he ordain'd Presbyters and Dea|cons, built Churches, and &s;o introduc'd the Chri&s;tian Religion into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Agreeable to this, are tho&s;e Relations which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> have in their Book of <HI>Axuma,</HI> onely that there is this addition to the Story of the Conver&s;ion made by <HI>Can|dace,</HI> that the&s;e <HI>Tyrian</HI> Young men admir'd, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> &s;hould believe in Chri&s;t and adore the Holy Trinity, and that the Women wore Cro&s;&s;es upon their heads, &s;eeing that the Go&s;pel had bin preach'd among them by none of the Apo&s;tles. We wonder much more, that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> &s;hould be converted in the time of the Apo&s;tles, and yet have no Bi|&s;hop, no Bapti&s;m, no Prie&s;ts nor Deacons, and that all the&s;e things &s;hould be fir&s;t &s;ettled in the time of St. <HI>Athana&s;ius.</HI> Be|&s;ides, no man can be ea&s;ily per&s;waded that &s;uch a beginning &s;hould remain &s;o long time without a farther progre&s;s, and that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> them&s;elves, or the Bi&s;hops of the Neigh|bouring Chri&s;tians &s;hould be &s;o neglectful as not to lend their helping hands to the advancement of &s;uch fair Beginnings, E&s;pecially at &s;uch a time, when the Chri&s;tians over the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, chiefly in <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;uffer'd a mo&s;t dreadful Per|&s;ecution under <HI>Diocle&s;ian.</HI> How came it to pa&s;s that they did not &s;eek for refuge in this Kingdom out of the reach of their Enemies, where they were &s;ure of Sanctuary and Protection from a Prince of their own Religion?

Were there no Martyrs, who&s;e memories the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> are &s;o &s;ollicitous to pre&s;erve?

<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;everal other great Doctors among them, who have highly merited for propagating the Chri|&s;tian Religion; as al&s;o many Martyrs, frequently celebrated by the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> and <HI>Coptices</HI> in their Religious Panegy|ricks. But as to their Saints, they relate of them, &s;everal Miracles more than Extraordinary: as the <HI>removing Moun|tains, appea&s;ing the rage of most Tempestuous Seas; rai&s;ing the Dead; cau&s;ing Water to &s;pring from &s;mitten Rocks, and walking over Ri|vers,</HI> which are reported for common Miracles among them: &s;o that if the Truth of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church were to be groun|ded upon &s;uch Wonders, there could be no purer Religion in the World. For tho we have a <HI>St. Martin,</HI> that gave a piece of his Cloak to one in nece&s;&s;ity, they have among 'em a Saint, that parted with his whole Garment to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. There are among them not onely &s;everal Stories of per&s;ons <HI>that have walk'd upon the A&s;p and the Ba&s;ilisk, and trampled upon the Dragon and the Lyon,</HI> but al&s;o tho&s;e who have rode upon tho&s;e Bea&s;ts, as upon Hor&s;es and Mules. Never were the <HI>A&s;cetae</HI> more au&s;tere. There are &s;ome who have liv'd for whole days together upon three little Dates, others upon no more than one poor little dry Bisket.</P>
<P>But there is not one more renowned for Sanctity among them, then <HI>Gabra-Menfes-Keddus,</HI> or the <HI>Servant of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> in honour of whom they keep a Holyday every month.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="117">Next to him is <HI>Tecla-Haimanot,</HI> or the <HI>Plant of Faith,</HI> who re&s;tor'd the Mona&s;tical way of Living, in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> about the Year of Chri&s;t 600. Whom the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Poet extolls in a mo&s;t &s;ingular manner.</P>

Some meerly out of a Pious and godly end; &s;ome out of an opinion of merit; &s;ome out of vain|glory and a de&s;ire of worldly fame; becau&s;e they found that au&s;terity of life, as being a thing hard to be undergone, was vulgarly much admir'd and highly applauded. Many al&s;o did not think it &s;ufficient to ab&s;tain from lawful enjoyments, or to bridle and re&s;train the ordinary de&s;ires of Nature, but voluntarily tormented them&s;elves with new invented Tor|tures, or macerated them&s;elves with hunger and famine.

their Farms can be call'd Cloy&s;ters, nor they be &s;aid to be re|ally Monks, but onely unmarried Husbandmen, and that onely while they pre&s;erve their Continency intire.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Sacred Books of the <HI>Habe&s;sines.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> together with the Chri&s;tian Religion, receiv'd the Holy Scripture, according to the Ver&s;ion of the <HI>70</HI> Interpreters&mdash;the New Testament from an Imperfect Copy and ill Printed. The Old Testament divided into four parts: The New Testament into as many- The <HI>Reve|lation</HI> added as an Appendix. To the New Testament are added the Con&s;titutions and Canons of the Apo&s;tles, as they call them, divided into Eight parts: Therefore they reckon &s;everal Sacred Books. Three Oecu|menical Councils. A fair Manu&s;cript of the Councils at <HI>Rome.</HI> Books therein contain'd. A Counterfeit Book of <HI>Enoch.</HI> Magical Prayers. Where|in Mon&s;trous words &s;eeming to be taken from the <HI>Jews.</HI> The Form of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Anathematizing.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>DIvine Wor&s;hip</HI> is &s;eldom found among any &s;ort of Nations in the World to be without Books, by which we apprehend from whence every particular kind of wor&s;hip derives it &s;elf, and by what means it got footing among the People: for the words and the wor&s;hip generally go together. Which is the rea&s;on there are &s;o many Hebrew and Greek words in all the Ver&s;ions of the Bible, and that we have &s;o many Latin words in our Theologie.</P>
<P>The <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> together with the Chri&s;tian Religion re|ceiv'd the holy Scripture. And this Scripture was tran&s;lated into that Idiom of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language, which was at that time more peculiar to the Inhabitants of <HI>Tigra,</HI> from the Greek Ver&s;ion of the Seventy Interpreters, according to a certain Copy us'd in the Church of <HI>Alexandria;</HI> which the in|numerable
<PB N="262" REF="120">
various Readings, that are in&s;erted into the <HI>Engli&s;h Polygl&ograve;tton</HI> Bibles, from one of the &s;ame Copies, plainly de|mon&s;trate, with which the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Tran&s;lation perfectly agrees, E&s;pecially in the 35 &amp; 39 Chapter of <HI>Exodus,</HI> which in other Copies are wonderfully mutilated. Nor is it with|out rea&s;on that a Colonie, as it were, of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church, &s;hould follow the Sacred Copies of their <HI>Metropolis.</HI> As for the Author and Time of the Tran&s;lation, I find no|thing certainly deliver'd concerning either: however it is mo&s;t probable that it was begun at the time when the <HI>Habe&s;|&s;ines</HI> were<NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">There is one who has written a certain <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Martyrologie, who a&s;|&s;erts, That <HI>Frumentius,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Abba-Salama,</HI> was the Author of the fir&s;t Tran&s;lation; but before I &s;ee it, I will not undertake to affirm it.</NOTE> converted, or a very &s;hort time after, and not in the time of the Apo&s;tles, as &s;ome have reported; and brought to perfection by &s;everal; becau&s;e the more rare and difficult words, &s;uch as are the names of Gemms, are not all alike in all the Books. For example, the <HI>Topaz</HI> in the 118 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> 127 <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> is call'd <HI>Pazjon,</HI> in <HI>Job</HI> 28.19. <HI>Tankar,</HI> in <HI>Revela|tions</HI> the 21.20. <HI>Warauri:</HI> and &s;o in many other words the &s;ame difference is ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>But for the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> they have it Tran&s;lated from the Authentic Greek Text, tho as yet it has not bin brought into <HI>Europe</HI> pure and intire. For the <HI>Roman</HI> Edition is printed from a lame imperfect Copy, &s;o that I was forc'd to fill up the Gapps which <HI>Tesfa-Tzejon</HI> had left, from the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Exemplars. This was ob&s;erv'd by &s;ome Learned Men, but not under&s;tanding the Cau&s;e, it made them think that the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Ver&s;ion had bin drawn from the Vulgar Latin. Per|haps they did not under&s;tand the&s;e following <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lines.</P>
<P><HI>The&s;e Acts of the Apo&s;tles, for the most part, were tran&s;lated at</HI> Rome <HI>out of the Latin, and Greek, for want of the</HI> Ethiopic <HI>Origi|ginal. For what we have added or omitted, we begg your pardon, and request of You to mend what is ami&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>More then this, the Publi&s;her of the Book beggs pardon, and excu&s;es the defect of the Edition, in regard of the igno|rant A&s;&s;i&s;tants which he had to help him.</P>
<P><HI>Fathers and Brethren, be pleas'd not to interpret ami&s;s the faults
<PB N="263" REF="120">
of this Edition; for they who Compos'd it could not read; and for our &s;elves we know not how to compo&s;e. So then we help'd them, and they a&s;si&s;ted us, as the blind leads the blind; and therefore we de|&s;ire you to pardon us and them.</HI></P>
<P>This Excu&s;e he al&s;o repeats in other places, as being con|&s;cious of its being defective in &s;everal other places. Never|thele&s;s the &s;ame Edition was afterwards printed in <HI>England,</HI> as an addition to that famous <HI>Poly Glotton;</HI> of which there is no other rea&s;on to be given, but that there was no other to be pro|cur'd.</P>
<P>However they enjoy the holy Scripture entire, and reck'n as many Books as we do, tho they divide them after another manner. For they di&s;tingui&s;h the Old Te&s;tament, which contains 46 Books into four Principal parts; to which they joyn certain other Books of a different Argument con&s;ult|ing more, perhaps, the Convenience of the Volumes, then the Dignity of the Matter. They al&s;o mix the <HI>Apocryphal</HI> with the Canonical, whether out of Carele&s;ne&s;s or Ignorance is uncertain. And as for <HI>Gregory,</HI> he plainly confe&s;s'd he had never heard of any &s;uch word as <HI>Apocrypha.</HI></P>

of the Primitive Rites and Ceremonies, written by the Indu&s;try of St. <HI>Clement,</HI> but they are very much different from tho&s;e that are di&s;pers'd among Us under the name of the Apo&s;tles.

Hence it was, that King <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Alvare&s;ius,</HI> That he had Four&s;core and one Books of Sacred Scripture; that is to &s;ay, Six and forty of Old Te&s;tament (reck'ning the <HI>Lamenta|tions</HI> by them&s;elves), and Thirty five of the New Te&s;tament, adding to the <HI>Twenty &s;even,</HI> tho&s;e Eight Books of Con&s;titu|tions and Canons, which the Ethiopians call <HI>Manda</HI> &amp; <HI>Abte|lis,</HI> the Signification of which were unknown to <HI>Gregory,</HI> as being words altogether Exotic.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the Religion of the <HI>Haba&s;sines</HI> at this Day.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Reports of <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian</HI> and <HI>Tzagazaab</HI> fal&s;e or uncer|tain. The Fathers have omitted their &s;ounde&s;t Opinions&mdash;And fix'd their &s;everal Errors upon them. The Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Claudius</HI> Genuine. The great Authority of the Synodal Writers. They admit the <HI>Nicene</HI> and other Councils till that of <HI>Chalcedon.</HI> They acknowledge the Trinity, one Per&s;on of Chri&s;t, and his &s;ufficient Merit. The Proceeding of the Holy Gho&s;t from the Son they deny. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Di&s;pute and Opinion. The <HI>Ethiopian</HI> interpretation of the word <HI>Proceed.</HI> The Sacraments, Bapti&s;m, Communion under both Kinds. The real Pre&s;ence. The words they u&s;e in Reference to it. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Opinion of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Of the Soul after Death. They pray for the Dead. Deny Purgatory. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Opinion concerning it. The Original of Prayer for the Dead. They pray to Saints and Angels. Their Catechi&s;m for Chil|dren and <HI>Neophytes.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WEre the Symbolical Book of the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> which they call <HI>Hajmanot-Abau</HI> to be found in <HI>Europe,</HI> we might ea&s;ily Collect from thence, the true and genuine Sence and Doctrine of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church concerning the Heads and Articles of the Chri|&s;tian Faith: for hitherto we find the mo&s;t of them uncer|tainly deliver'd, and for the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith &s;et down by <HI>Matthew</HI> the <HI>Armenian,</HI> and <HI>Tzagazaab,</HI> we have already taken notice of the failings in it. The Fathers of the Socie|ty, that have been conver&s;ant among the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> both in this and the former Century, and frequently di&s;cours'd with their Learned Men, pa&s;&s;ing by their &s;ound and &s;erious Opinions, tax them of many Errors which they have receiv'd from the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Jews.</HI> As for Example,</P>
<P><HI>That the Spirit proceeds only from the Father.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the Human Nature of Chri&s;t is equal to his Divinity.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="124"><HI>They acknowledge but one Will and one Operation in Chri&s;t; for which rea&s;on they believe that we affirm Four Per&s;ons in the Godhead, &s;eeing that we confe&s;s two Wills and two Natures in Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They repeat the Ceremony of Bapti&s;m every year upon the Fea&s;t of the</HI> Epiphany.</P>
<P><HI>They believe that the Souls of the Ju&s;t &s;hall not be receiv'd into Heaven before the end of the World; nor do they think them to be Created, but produc'd out of Matter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They neither confe&s;s the Number, nor the particular Species of their Sins, but cry in general, I have &s;in'd, I have &s;in'd.</HI></P>
<P><HI>They u&s;e not the Sacrament</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;m, nor Extream Unction upon the approach of Death; nor do they mind the Con&s;olation of the bread of life. In&s;omuch that many of them &s;tick not to &s;ay, That they who follow the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion, are not only</HI> Heretics, <HI>but wor&s;e than the</HI> Mahumetans.</P>
<P><HI>They reject the Council of</HI> Chalcedon, <HI>ca&s;ting many reproaches upon</HI> Leo <HI>the Great; but highly applauding</HI> Dio&s;curus.</P>
<P><HI>They deny Purgatory.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things I cho&s;e to deliver almo&s;t in the very words of <HI>Godignus,</HI> who Collected them out of the Relations and Letters of <HI>Gonzalez Rodoric, Alphon&s;us de Franca, Emanuel Fer|nandez,</HI> and others of the Society. Neither do they &s;eem to be improbable; but how they evade or excu&s;e them, we &s;hall &s;hortly declare. As to what is &s;aid that &s;ome of them believe the Followers of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion to be wor&s;e than <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> I could not hear any &s;uch thing from <HI>Gregory:</HI> neither did he think it was to be under&s;tood in reference to their Doctrine, but their Tyranny over their Subjects; it being the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> only to vex and oppre&s;s all tho&s;e who are under their Power, profe&s;&s;ing a Religion contrary to theirs, but never to rage again&s;t them with Fire and Sword.</P>
<P>In the mean time we have a Confe&s;&s;ion &s;et forth by King <HI>Claudius;</HI> but the &s;cope of that Confe&s;&s;ion was only to clear him&s;elf and his Subjects from the Imputation of <HI>Judai&s;m,</HI> which he found to be the only rea&s;on that impeded the Amity between him and the <HI>Portugals.</HI> Therefore leaving this Confe&s;&s;ion, by what we can gather from their Publick Liturgies, and the Writings and Sayings of Per&s;ons, both Publick and Private, the &s;um of the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> Doctrine &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t of the following Heads.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="125">Fir&s;t, They acknowledge the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> to be the &s;ole and only <HI>Rule</HI> of what they are to believe, and what they are to do: in&s;omuch that King <HI>David</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Alvarez,</HI> That if the Pope &s;hould impo&s;e upon Him or His Subjects, any thing what the Apo&s;tles had not written or permitted, he would not obey him; nor his own <HI>Metropolitan</HI> if he &s;hould attempt to do the like. But with the Scripture they are &s;o much in love, that there is nothing more de|lightful to their Ears, than the repetition of it. There|fore &s;aith <HI>Tellez,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nothing more pleas'd the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ines <HI>than to hear the Scripture often quoted in Sermons; and the more Citations a man brings out of Scripture, the more learned be is accompted.</HI></P>
<P>Nor do they give much le&s;s Credit to the Three Oecu|menical Councils, as appears by the Confe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Claudius.</HI> They generally make u&s;e of the <HI>Nicene Creed,</HI> which they call <HI>Tzalot Hajmanot, the Prayer of the Faith.</HI> That which we u&s;e they have not, no more than all the re&s;t of the Ea&s;tern Churches; a &s;trong Argument, that it was not compil'd by the Apo&s;tles, tho' in regard of the Doctrine which it con|tains, it may be truly call'd <HI>Apostolic.</HI> For certainly the <HI>Ni|cene</HI> Fathers would not have &s;tifl'd &s;uch a Creed, or &s;et forth another of their own, had the Apo&s;tles left &s;uch an Epitome of their Doctrine behind them. The Ancient Greek Coun|cils then are the Councils which the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> have in reve|rence, together with the Eighty four ancient Canons added to tho&s;e of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Council, till they come to that of <HI>Chal|cedon,</HI> which they do not only utterly reject, but al&s;o Crimi|nally reproach.</P>
<P>Whatever therefore the Catholic Church admitted and believ'd before that Council, concerning God, Three in one; the Three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons in one E&s;&s;ence; the Eternity of the Son of God, the Exi&s;tence of the Holy Gho&s;t, and o|ther Articles of Faith, all tho&s;e things the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> willing|ly con&s;ent to and allow, condemning tho&s;e that Di&s;pute again&s;t them. By the way, we are here to ob&s;erve, that the Ethiopic words, <HI>Sab&s;atu Gaz Gaz Egza Bahr,</HI> Three Per&s;ons and one God, are vulgarly ill Tran&s;lated, being to have bin render'd, <HI>Three Faces, One Lord;</HI> for the word <HI>Gaz,</HI> &s;ignifies as well the <HI>Face</HI> or <HI>Countenance,</HI> as it bears the force of the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, or <HI>Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="125">The Ne&s;torian Here&s;ie a&s;&s;erting two Per&s;ons in Chri&s;t, they &s;o abhor, that for that very rea&s;on they will not ad|mit of his two Natures, and two Wills, tho they po&s;itive|ly acknowledge his Divinity and Humanity. For they af|firm Chri&s;t to be true and perfect God; and al&s;o true and perfect Man, and to con&s;i&s;t in one Individual Per&s;on of Divinity and Humanity, without Confu&s;ion and Com|mixtion.</P>
<P>Farthermore, They acknowledge the mo&s;t Sacred Merits of Chri&s;t; to be mo&s;t &s;ufficient and efficacious for the Sins of the whole world, and con&s;equently of all Mankind; and this <HI>Gregory</HI> him&s;elf affirm'd to be true: nor have I found in any of their Books which I have happen'd to &s;ee, any thing that contradicts what he a&s;&s;erted. However, as the Greeks do, they deny the Proceeding of the Holy Gho&s;t from the Son; yet all this while they acknowledge him to be equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son, and to be a Per&s;on &s;ub&s;i&s;ting of him&s;elf. For thus they declare in their Liturgy.</P>
<P><HI>We believe the Father &s;ending, that the Father is in his own Per|&s;on. And we believe the Son who is &s;ent, that the Son is in his own Per&s;on, and we believe the Holy Gho&s;t who de&s;cended upon</HI> Jor|dan, <HI>and upon the Apo&s;tles, that the Holy Gho&s;t is in his own Per&s;on; Three Names, One God. Not as</HI> Abraham <HI>who is elder than</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>nor as</HI> I&s;aac <HI>who is Elder than</HI> Jacob. <HI>It is not &s;o, The Father is not Elder than the Son, becau&s;e he is the Father, nor the Son Elder than the Holy Gho&s;t, nor the Holy Gho&s;t le&s;&s;er or Younger than the Father and the Son, nor is the Son Younger than the Father, becau&s;e he is the Son. Not as</HI> Abraham <HI>who command|ed over</HI> I&s;aac <HI>in re&s;pect of Generation, becau&s;e he begat him, nor as</HI> I&s;aac <HI>who commanded</HI> Jacob. <HI>It is not &s;o in Divinity; The Father does not command the Son, becau&s;e he is the Father; nei|ther is the Son greater than the Holy Gho&s;t, becau&s;e he is the Son. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t are Equal; One God, one Glory, one Kingdom, one Power, one Empire.</HI></P>
<P>But concerning the <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is,</HI> or Per&s;on of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> really di&s;tinct from the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> the Author of the <HI>Organon</HI> thus di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>But lea&s;t any one, from what has been already &s;aid, &s;hould infer, that the Holy Gho&s;t is not a perfect and di&s;tinct Per|&s;on;
<PB N="274" REF="126">
therefore &s;aid Chri&s;t to his Apo&s;tles, <HI>I will &s;end you ano|ther Comforter.</HI> By which we know that the Holy Gho&s;t doth exi&s;t together with the Father and the Son, and al&s;o to|gether in his own proper Sub&s;i&s;tance or Per&s;on. Not that the Holy Gho&s;t is partly in the Son, partly in his own Per&s;on, but one and the &s;ame, exi&s;tent in his proper Per&s;on, and exi|&s;tent with the Father and the Son.</P>
<P><HI>Gregory</HI> being ask'd, whether this were the unanimous and con&s;tant Opinion of all the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Doctors? reply'd, <HI>It was.</HI> I thereupon urg'd, <HI>Why they deny'd that the Holy Gho&s;t proceeded from the Father? &s;eeing they a&s;&s;erted, that he was equally the Spirit of the Father and the Son? He de&s;ir'd, That I would first expound what was meant by Proceeding from the Father,</HI> and then he would give the rea&s;on of the Denyal; and that for his part, he kept to the words of the Scripture, <HI>John</HI> 15.26. and 16.24. <HI>Who goeth out from the Father, and takes from the Son;</HI> and that he &s;ought no farther. For that it was not lawful in Di&s;putes concerning the mo&s;t ab&s;tru&s;e My&s;teries of the Holy Trinity, to argue by Con&s;equences; but to &s;tick clo&s;e to the very words and Expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture them|&s;elves. That I &s;hould con&s;ider what would follow, if we &s;hould argue from the Unity and Equality of E&s;&s;ence to the Characteri&s;tical Proprieties of the Per&s;ons. As if any one &s;hould undertake to averr, <HI>That Chri&s;t is the Son of the Holy Gho&s;t, becau&s;e the Holy Gho&s;t is one and Coeternal God with the Father.</HI> Some &s;uch kind of Argument his Countryman <HI>Tzagazaab</HI> may be thought to have had in his Brain, when he wrote, That Chri&s;t was the Son of him&s;elf, and the Beginning of him|&s;elf, becau&s;e he was co-e&s;&s;ential with the Father, who&s;e Son he was. By the way we are to under&s;tand, That the <HI>Ethiopi|ans,</HI> in&s;tead of the word <HI>Vazzea, went forth or proceeded,</HI> and in the Preterperfect ten&s;e, u&s;e the word <HI>Saraz,</HI> to <HI>budd</HI> or <HI>&s;prout forth.</HI> Thus <HI>Claudius</HI> in his Confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>I believe in the Holy Gho&s;t, reviving Lord,</HI> Za&s;ratz em Ab, <HI>who proceeded or &s;prung from the Father.</HI></P>
<P>They never add from the Son, altho the Liturgy Printed at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Tzagazaab</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion runs thus, <HI>Za&s;raz em Ab vavalde,</HI> who &s;prouted forth or proceeded from the Fa|ther and the Son. Where 'tis much to be doubted, that <HI>from the Son</HI> was in&s;erted by another hand</P>
<P>We proceed to the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> of which they neither have the common name nor number. For they are utterly igno|rant
<PB N="275" REF="126">
of <HI>Confirmation</HI> and <HI>Extreme Unction.</HI> They make u&s;e of the word <HI>Ma&s;tar,</HI> for a <HI>My&s;terie,</HI> whenever they go about to intimate the My&s;terie of the Participation of the Body and Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Otherwi&s;e they do not think it nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;ignifie the <HI>Seals of Faith,</HI> by any other Vulgar name not us'd in Scripture, or to make much di&s;pute about the Number. Only &s;aid <HI>Gregory,</HI> They make u&s;e of <HI>Bap|ti&s;m</HI> according to the In&s;titution of Chri&s;t, and with the Ce|remonies anciently made u&s;e of by the Church. But the Fathers of the Society reported, That the Ceremonies of Bapti&s;m were &s;o deprav'd and corrupted among the <HI>Habe&s;|&s;ines,</HI> that they were con&s;train'd to Rebaptize great Num|bers under a Condition.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Holy Communion,</HI> they Admini&s;ter it indifferently to all, both Layety and Clergy, as it is the Cu&s;tom in all the Churches of the Ea&s;t. Neither has any thing more alienated their minds from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> than their finding the Layety to be depriv'd of the Cup by the Latins. <HI>Gregory</HI> being de|manded what he thought of the real Pre&s;ence of the Body and Blood in the <HI>Lord's Supper?</HI> made an&s;wer, That he ac|knowledged it. Adding withal, according to his manner, when any Di&s;cour&s;es aro&s;e of Matters more difficult and ab|&s;tru&s;e than ordinary, <HI>Retzitze nagare vet,</HI> 'tis a nice bu&s;ine&s;s; or, <HI>Ma&s;tar vet, It is a My&s;tery.</HI> When I produc'd him the&s;e words in the Liturgies.</P>
<P><HI>Lord now lay thy hand upon this Di&s;h, Ble&s;s it, Sanctifie it, and Purifie it, that &s;o thy Body may be made holy therein.</HI></P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P><HI>Lay thy hand upon this Cup, and now ble&s;s it, &s;anctifie it, and purifie it, that thy Blood may become holy therein.</HI></P>
<P>In another place.</P>
<P><HI>Lay thy hand upon this Spoon of the Cro&s;s, to prepare the Body and Blood of thy only Son our Lord and God.</HI></P>
<P>And in another place,</P>
<P><HI>Convert this Bread, that it may become thy pure Body, which is joyn'd with this Cup of thy mo&s;t precious Blood.</HI></P>
<P>And out of the Euchari&s;tic Prayer, which bears the Title of the 318 <HI>Orthodox Divines,</HI> the&s;e following words:</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="127"><HI>Let the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cend, and come and &s;hine upon this Bread, that it may be made the Body of Christ our Lord, and that the ta&s;te and &s;avour of this Cup may be chang'd, that &s;o it may be made the Blood of Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And when I ask'd him withal the Expo&s;ition of the words <HI>Majete vat valto,</HI> to <HI>be chang'd or converted;</HI> and then demand|ed of him, <HI>Whether he did not think that the &s;ubstance of the Bread and Wine was not chang'd and converted into the Sub&s;tance of the Body and Blood of Christ?</HI> He made an&s;wer, <HI>That no &s;uch &s;ort of Tran&s;ubstantiation was known or understood by the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ines. <HI>That his Countrymen were not &s;o &s;crupulous, nor us'd to &s;tart &s;uch thorny Questions. Neverthele&s;s it &s;eem'd to him probable and like, that the vulgar Bread and Wine was chang'd into the mysterious Repre&s;entation of the Body and Blood of Je&s;us Christ;</HI> and &s;o was alter'd from Prophane to Sacred, to repre&s;ent the true Body and Blood of Chri&s;t to the Communicants. <HI>Tellez</HI> confe&s;&s;es his di&s;&s;atisfaction touching their Con&s;ecration, it being their Cu&s;tom to &s;ay over the Body of Chri&s;t, <HI>This bread is my Body;</HI> and over the Wine, <HI>This cup is my Blood.</HI> Which words have not in them the true force of Con&s;ecration. For the Doctors of the <HI>Roman</HI> Church are of Opinion, That whoever &s;peaks tho&s;e words, does nothing; The&s;e words, <HI>This is my Body,</HI> being only of Efficacy to operate a true Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation. Which being true, no man can pretend that the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> ac|knowlege Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, e&s;pecially &s;eeing they do not attribute tho&s;e Divine Honours to the Sacraments, which the Con&s;equences of real Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation require.</P>
<P>Concerning the &s;tate of the Soul after Death, there are &s;e|veral Opinions among the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> every one having free Liberty of Opinion in tho&s;e things that do not directly con|cern Eternal Salvation. So that it is no wonder that &s;o ma|ny various Sentiments of private per&s;ons are brought away by our Doctors, as the publick Opinions of the <HI>Habe&s;sines.</HI></P>
<P>Some of them believe that the Souls of Men piou&s;ly de|cea&s;ed, &s;hall not behold the Beatifical Vi&s;ion of God before the Re&s;urrection of the Body; which is al&s;o the Opinion of many of the Ancient Latins: as if the Soul remain'd in Ex|pectation of the Body in &s;ome certain third place. Others, convinc'd by the Authority of the Scripture, <HI>acknowledge on|ly two Man&s;ions of the Souls, Heaven and Hell; believing no Damnatinn to tho&s;e that are in Chri&s;t, and dye in his Faith.</HI>
<PB N="277" REF="127">
Which they gather from the Example of the Penitent Thief, and the words of Chri&s;t, thus Tran&s;lated by the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI>
<Q>Verily I &s;ay unto thee, firmly believe, that thou &s;halt be with me in Paradice.</Q></P>
<P>Therefore, as for tho&s;e that Piou&s;ly &s;leep in Chri&s;t, they believe them not to be in a wor&s;e Condition than this Thief, who at the point of Death was &s;av'd through Peni|tence actuated by Faith, without any &s;atisfaction given for his Thieveries. Now to prove that the Soul of Man is not created, they produce this Argument, That God perfected the whole Work of his Creation upon the Sixth day. Never|thele&s;s they believe it to be in its own Nature immortal, as being in&s;pir'd into Man by God, at his fir&s;t Creation. But on the other &s;ide, they think it very ab&s;urd that God &s;hould be ty'd to create new Souls every day for Adulterate and In|ce&s;tuous Births.</P>
<P>However the fir&s;t Opinion &s;eems to be the more vulgar|ly receiv'd among them; in regard of their Prayers for the Dead: As for example.</P>
<P><HI>Remember, Lord, the Souls of thy Servants, and our Father,</HI> Abba-Matthew, <HI>and the re&s;t of our Fathers,</HI> Abba-Salama, <HI>and</HI> Abba-Jacob.</P>
<P>And a little after,</P>
<P><HI>Remember, Lord, the Kings of</HI> Ethiopia, Abreha; <HI>and</HI> Atzbeha, Caleb, <HI>and</HI> Gebra-Meskah, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then they add,</P>
<P><HI>Relea&s;e, O Lord, our Fathers</HI> Abba Antony <HI>and</HI> Abba Ma|carius.</P>
<P><HI>Remember, Lord, the Soul of thy Servant, our Father</HI> Tecla-Hajmanot, <HI>with all his Companions.</HI></P>
<P>From whence it may be fairly ju&s;tify'd, that the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> admit of a <HI>Purgatory.</HI> And yet <HI>Gregory</HI> con&s;tantly deny'd it.

<P>But they nothing mov'd with the&s;e Arguments and Infe|rences, affirm them to be <HI>the Pious Conception of their good wi&s;hes, and only a Commemoration of the happy E&s;tate of the deceas'd; and that it is none of their bu&s;ine&s;s to make any farther &s;crutiny into the Traditions of their Ance&s;tors. Gregory</HI> added, That <HI>many Prayers</HI> of the Chri&s;tians were &s;o conceiv'd, that many times tho&s;e things were Petition'd for, which were <HI>already perform'd and an&s;wer'd. That the Lord's Prayer contain'd Petitions of that kind. For that it would be a thing but badly inferr'd, that the Name of God was not Hallow'd, or that his Will was not done both in Heaven and Earth, becau&s;e we daily put up tho&s;e Prayers: be|&s;ides we all begg every day for Daily Bread, when mo&s;t of tho&s;e that make that Prayer, do generally live in wealthy abundance.</HI> He had heard perhaps among us our general good Wi&s;hes for the departed, That <HI>God would vouch&s;afe to grant the Interr'd Body a Quiet Repo&s;e, and at length a joyful Re&s;urrection.</HI> And thereupon, &s;aid he, <HI>Do not you your &s;elves wi&s;h the &s;ame good wi&s;hes for the Dead? Do not you believe that the Carka&s;&s;es of the Dead may be vexed with Spiritual Evils? or that a happy Re&s;ur|rection may be obtain'd by your Prayers.</HI> And he took &s;o heinou&s;ly the &s;u&s;pition of his belief of Purgatory, that he cry'd out, <HI>Would it not be an irreverent Injury to &s;o many Kings and Fathers, &s;hould we interpret the Commemoration of their Souls to that height, as to think they &s;hould be tormented for &s;o many Ages in Purgatory, and want the aid of our indefatigable Prayers to relea&s;e them after &s;o long an Impri&s;onment?</HI> For tho&s;e Kings and Fathers were men among the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> mo&s;t Innocent, and had bin dead above a Thou&s;and years &s;ince or more. So that whether they be in Paradice, or remain in any other place, expecting the Re&s;urrection of their Bodies, in both ca&s;es Prayers of that Nature &s;eem &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, were there any Que&s;tion to be made of the happy Condition of Men Piou&s;ly deceas'd, we &s;hould rather pray for tho&s;e who&s;e lives were more loo&s;e and vain, than for tho&s;e who&s;e Conver&s;ations were without blame. And there|fore what has bin deliver'd about the Opinions of the <HI>Ha|be&s;&s;ines</HI> concerning Purgatory, leans rather upon Conjecture than any &s;ufficient Authority, they being ignorant of the

very Name. In&s;omuch that <HI>Jacob Wemmers</HI> the <HI>Carmelite,</HI> in his <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Lexicon, was con&s;train'd to forge a Word, by calling it <HI>Mantzehi Hatate,</HI> the Purger of Sin. But we are to under&s;tand, that it was the mo&s;t Ancient Cu&s;tom of the Church fir&s;t of all to read the Names of the Holy Martyrs out of the Public Regi&s;ters, as being a Duty owing to the memory of the invincible Te&s;timonies for Chri&s;t. Which the following Ages &s;train'd another way, as if they had need of our Interce&s;&s;ion; and others, as if we could not be with|out their Interce&s;&s;ion, made it a pre&s;ence to invoke the Holy Saints, as if they were pre&s;ent and heard them. To which we may add, That the Ancient Chri&s;tian Orators, and Wri|ters of Homilies, making u&s;e of their Rhetorick, by vertue of that Figure, commonly call'd <HI>Pro&s;opopocia,</HI> be&s;poke the ble&s;&s;ed Saints, and introduc'd them as it were returning An|&s;wers; from whence it is not improbable that Su&s;pition might introduce the Cu&s;tom of giving the &s;ame Adoration to them as to God him&s;elf, and wor&s;hipping them with Temples, Altars, and other Divine Honours. Which ne|verthele&s;s the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> do not do; for though they keep Holydaies in memory of their Saints, they do not call them <HI>Bagnabat, Solemnities;</HI> but <HI>Tjabarat, Remembrances.</HI> They al&s;o invoke them, tho they know not after what manner they may be able to hear them; and beg their Interce&s;&s;ions al&s;o, e&s;pecially of the mo&s;t Holy Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> to whom they bear &s;uch an affectionate Reverence, that they think whatever the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has invented to her Honour, all too little; and yet they erect no Statues to her memory for all that, being contented only with her Pictures. When they were in a rage again&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and pur&s;u'd 'em in their fury with Sticks and Stones, they cry'd out, <HI>Kill, Kill; whoever is not an Enemy of</HI> Marie, <HI>let him take up a Stone to &s;tone her Enemies to Death.</HI></P>
<P>But more than this, they many times invoke the Angels, as having for that perhaps a more &s;pecious pretence, becau&s;e they have bin frequently &s;aid to appear to good Men and Women, and hear their Prayers.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> reckon no le&s;s than Nine Orders, which they borrow from their Names and Epithites given them in Sacred Scripture.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of the Rites and Ceremonies of the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Church, as al&s;o of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ine</HI> Temples.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Sacred Rites often an Occa&s;ion of Di&s;turbance in the Church. The Prudent Decree of the Apo&s;tles. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Conde&s;cen&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary. <HI>Judai&s;h</HI> Rites retain'd. Many new Ceremonies invented by the Pope, by the <HI>Alexan|drian</HI> Metropolitan none. The mo&s;t ancient Ceremonies retain'd by the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines.</HI> Their Churches dark, like the Synagogues. The Divi&s;ions of them, and Quires. The Nobility made Deacons. The Bi&s;hops Lodgings. Much honour'd. They admit of Pictures. They &s;ign with the Cro&s;s. Bap|ti&s;m of grown People. &V;ndertakers why &s;o call'd. The Euchari&s;t given to baptiz'd Infants. Some frivolous forms of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> con&s;train'd the Fathers to Rebaptize. The Cu&s;tom of Annual Bathing not effectual for Bapti&s;m. The abu&s;e of it. The State of Eccle&s;iastical Affairs mi|&s;erable in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia.</HI> The Rea&s;ons. General Confe&s;&s;ion. Ab&s;olution. Before <HI>25</HI> years of Age they believe them&s;elves Innocent. Much Preach|ing. <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s Opinion of their Sermons. They Read Homilies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Sacred Ve&s;&s;els for the Eucharist. Why the Stone Con&s;ecrated by the <HI>Romans</HI> is call'd a <HI>Che&s;t</HI> by the <HI>Habe&s;&s;inians.</HI> A particular Di&s;cour&s;e of the Author. Leavened Bread. The Wine di&s;tributed in a Spoon. The defect of it &s;upply'd, The time and place for the Holy Supper. Two Holydaies in a Week. They want Bells. Their Mu&s;ic unplea&s;ing, yet they Daunce about. Fa&s;tings, and fourth and &s;ixth Holydaies whence. None during <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> Of the Fa&s;ts of the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Europe.</HI> The beginning of the year. Their manner of Computation, Nuptial Rites. Polygamy. Marriages of Cou&s;in Germans, or fir&s;t Cou&s;ins. Divorces. Burials.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HItherto we have &s;et forth what the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> believe concerning the <HI>Trinity,</HI> &amp; the Principal Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith. The order of our Story now requires that we &s;hould &s;ay &s;omething of their Rites and Ceremonies. For tho it nothing avail at what time or in what manner &s;ound Doctrine be Preach'd, &s;o that all things be done de|cently and in order; neverthele&s;s the&s;e Rites and Ceremo|nies have begat great Di&s;putes, and produc'd great Di&s;tur|bances in the Church.</P>
<P>For indeed from the very Infancy of the Go&s;pel, vari|ous were the Contentions of Holy and Pious men about Ce|remonies. Some believ'd that the <HI>Judaic</HI> Rites, not being ex|pre&s;ly abrogated by Chri&s;t, were of nece&s;&s;ity to be ob&s;erv'd, together with the Doctrine and Sacraments of the New Te|&s;tament,
<PB N="284" REF="131">
even as helps to Salvation. Others there were who judg'd that they might be profitably retain'd, though not of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, as well in remembrance of the ancient Church of God, as to gain the Souls of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The fir&s;t Opinion the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves Condemn'd. In other things u&s;ing Apo&s;tolic Prudence and Moderation, they made a di&s;tinction betwen <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Ethnics</HI> newly Converted. For they not only permitted the <HI>Jews</HI> to retain their ancient Rites, but per&s;waded <HI>Paul</HI> to comply with &s;o many Millions of unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who were Zealous Admirers of the Law, and accus'd <HI>Paul,</HI> for teaching a Defection from the Law, for forbidding Infants to be Circumciz'd, and for not living according to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Cu&s;toms. <HI>Paul</HI> obey'd, and purify'd him&s;elf with his Companions, &s;hav'd his Head, and &s;o entring the Temple together, offer'd up an Offering for every one of them. Nay, more then this, what would be now accompted a heinous Crime, he caus'd <HI>Timothy</HI> to be Circumciz'd, being induc'd thereto by the Nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e times. Yet at another time he condemn'd Circumci&s;ion, if it were done with a <HI>Judaic</HI> Intention.</P>
<P>Thus an Action in it &s;elf indifferent, becomes bad or good, from the Rea&s;on and Intention of the Agent. But then, what what was to be done with the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that embrac'd the Faith of Chri&s;t, the Apo&s;tles took into their Deliberation. Never|thele&s;s they would not oblige them to the Ob&s;ervation of the <HI>Mo&s;aic</HI> Law, but only in an&s;wer to their Doubts, they com|manded them only to ab&s;tain from tho&s;e things, which might not only create in the <HI>Jews</HI> a di&s;like of the Go&s;pel; but al&s;o very much &s;candalize tho&s;e that were already Pro&s;elytes, and di&s;turb mutual Charity and Friend&s;hip in daily Conver&s;e and Society. For the <HI>Jews</HI> would not Dyet with tho&s;e who eat things <HI>Sacrific'd to Idols,</HI> or <HI>&s;trangled,</HI> nor the <HI>blood</HI> it &s;elf. From that time &s;ome of the <HI>Judaic</HI> Rites prevail'd as indiffe|rent among mo&s;t, who did not contend again&s;t Piety and Chri&s;tian Doctrine. Till at length by degrees they were either abrogated by the Church, or worn out of U&s;e. Nor had the mo&s;t ancient In&s;titutions of the Chri&s;tians any other Originals, as the <HI>Building of Churches, Plunging the whole Body in Bapti&s;m,</HI> Two <HI>Fa&s;t Dayes</HI> in a Week, Fe&s;tivals and the like. However there were but few Ceremonies in the trou|ble&s;ome times of the Church; but in the times of Peace, they increas'd to Infinity: and the wor&s;e the &s;tate of the Church
<PB N="285" REF="131">
was, the more Ceremonies; in&s;omuch that St. <HI>Austin</HI> com|plain'd in his time, <HI>That the mo&s;t whol&s;om Precepts of Divine Books were not &s;o much regarded, as the fictitious Comments and In|ventions of Men upon them.</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> by how much more opulent and powerful than the re&s;t; &s;o much the more &s;edulou&s;ly and indu&s;triou&s;ly it compos'd all things to Splendour and Pomp. The <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff being the &s;ole Judge of all things, whether convenient, or not commodi|ous, and what he thought fit to Abrogate or E&s;tabli&s;h. But the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> whom the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> obey as their High Pontiff, what with the unhappy Contentions between the <HI>Melchites,</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> and the Per&s;ecutions of the <HI>Sa|racens,</HI> has had enough to do to keep his own Station, not be|ing at lei&s;ure in the mid&s;t of &s;o many Storms, to think of di|vulging new Ceremonies. Nor would the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> out of their wonted &s;implicity and plain heartedne&s;s, the be&s;t Pre|&s;erver of ancient Cu&s;tom, attempt to alter or abrogate any thing without his leave or Command. Whence it comes to pa&s;s, that many of the mo&s;t ancient Cu&s;toms of the Primi|tive times, in other places out of date or abrogated, are &s;till retain'd to this day among them. Which makes us hope that our Labour will not be ungrateful to the Reader, cu|rious of Eccle&s;ia&s;tic Antiquity, if we compare the Old with the New. Fir&s;t, only their Churches are briefly to be de|&s;crib'd, which formerly were &s;ufficiently Magnificent, and by King <HI>Ladibela</HI> hewn out of the Bodies of the Rocks them|&s;elves. Some were al&s;o Built by the Succeeding Kings; but <HI>Grainus,</HI> out of his hatred to Chri&s;tianity, ruin'd the greate&s;t part of them. There are yet remaining &s;ome Foot&s;teps of that famous Cathedral, which <HI>Helena, David</HI>'s Grandmother Built: In which there is more want of Light than of Gold or Silver. The Structure of mo&s;t re&s;embles the Ancient Architecture. For the ancient Chri&s;tians, when fir&s;t they had obtain'd the Opportunities of building Churches for Public U&s;e, choo&s;ing rather to imitate the <HI>Jews,</HI> than the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> Built them in imitation of the ancient Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogues; nor did they give them the heatheni&s;h Names of Temples; but call'd them <HI>Ilyriacas,</HI> as it were dedicated to God, or el&s;e <HI>Oratories,</HI> or <HI>Martyria,</HI> Places of Public Te&s;timony. Now as the Tem|ple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> being encompa&s;&s;ed with a &s;pacious Wall, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly of three parts; that is to &s;ay, <GAP DESC="foreign"> or the
<PB N="286" REF="132">
<HI>wide Porch,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>the body of the Temple;</HI> and la&s;tly, <GAP DESC="foreign"> or the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> &s;o the Cathedrals of the Ancients, had a Porch before the great Folding Dores &s;urrounded with a Wall, where the <HI>Excommunicated,</HI> and <HI>Penitents,</HI> and <HI>Novices</HI> were oblig'd to tarry, till the latter more fully in&s;tructed in Chri&s;tianity, were admitted to Bapti&s;m; or the former brought forth the real fruits of Amendment. Then there was the Body of the Church, in the middle of which was a <HI>&s;ecret Place,</HI> &s;creen'd with a Curtain, which was call'd the <HI>Sacrificatory,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Sugge&s;tum,</HI> or place where the Pulpit &s;tood, in Greek <GAP DESC="foreign">, which repre&s;ented the <HI>Holy of Holies.</HI> Such a <HI>Sugge&s;tum,</HI> or Place of A&s;cen&s;ion is &s;till to be &s;een in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogues, and call'd in imitation of the Greek word <HI>Bimah.</HI> But this the <HI>Europeans</HI> afterward thought more convenient to remove to the farther end of the Church: we call it now the <HI>Quire,</HI> for the mo&s;t part &s;eparated with Iron Lattices from the Body of the Structure. The&s;e Antique Forms of Building were accommodated to the ancient Cere|monies. For as the <HI>Jews</HI> were admitted no farther than the Dores, and the Prie&s;ts only &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s beyond the Thre|&s;hold, &s;o here none but the Baptiz'd were admitted as it were into the Bo&s;om of the Church, the re&s;t, like the <HI>Gen|tiles</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> prohibited from approaching nearer than the Dores. The Quire none but the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per|&s;ons enter'd, which was &s;o rigidly ob&s;erv'd by the An|cients, that St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> commanded the Emperor him&s;elf <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> to withdraw; whereas the Greek Church allow'd that Priviledge to their Emperors, and gave them Liberty to enter the Sanctuary when they offer'd to the Sacred Ta|ble. After the &s;ame manner, the more famous Churches of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> were Built; and they have al&s;o the &s;ame &s;ort of Sanctuaries, which they call by the Hebrew Name, <HI>Heichel,</HI> at the entry whereof the Layety &s;tand and receive the Communion. Lea&s;t therefore their Nobility and their Children &s;hould be forc'd to &s;tand among the Vulgar Croud, or they be con&s;train'd to break their Law and Cu&s;tom, Pro|hibiting the Layety to enter their <HI>Heichel,</HI> and participate of their Sacred My&s;teries, they have found out a new Eva&s;ion, by Creating the Nobility and their Children, tho' ne're &s;o young, or under Age, <HI>Deacons</HI> or <HI>Sub-deacons;</HI> in that only deviating from their ancient Simplicity. The King's Chil|dren a&s;&s;ume that Dignity of cour&s;e, carrying a Cro&s;s, as a
<PB N="287" REF="132">
badge of their <HI>Deacon&s;hip,</HI> which they ne'r leave off when they come to the Crown. Which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> looking upon as an Ornament of <HI>Prie&s;thood,</HI> it gave them an occa&s;ion to give the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Emperor the Title of <HI>Presbyter John.</HI> There is al&s;o a little Chappel adjoyning to the Ea&s;tern part of the Church, in which the Bread and other Nece&s;&s;aries belonging to the Euchari&s;t are prepar'd. Such little Chap|pels or Rooms were Built of old near to the great Church, where the Bi&s;hops were wont to put on their Ve&s;tments: now they are &s;mall Apartments made within the Walls of the Church, call'd by the Name of Ve&s;tries. They have no Seats in their Churches, for they neither &s;it nor kneel, but always &s;tand during Divine Service; according to the an|cient Canons, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> ob&s;erve to this day, as believing it more becoming the Reverence due to the Place, and more proper for Attention than to &s;it. The next Age providing more kindly for Infirmity, permitted &s;itting, lea&s;t Attention &s;hould be tyr'd by wearine&s;s. But the <HI>Habe&s;|&s;ines</HI> have found out a way between both; that is to &s;ay, little Crutches to lean and re&s;t their Bodies, which when they go away, they leave in the Church Porch. If there be any who out of weakne&s;s chance to &s;it upon the Ground, they are in the mid'&s;t of Prayers commanded by the Dea|cons to ri&s;e, in the&s;e words, <HI>Eb Tarber, Tan&s;e,</HI> You <HI>that &s;it, Ri&s;e.</HI> Nay, &s;uch is their Reverence to their Churches, that tho at this day they are only poor low dark Buildings, thatch'd with Straw or Reeds, yet when they approach near to any of them in their Travels, they alight from their Mules, and walk a foot till they are pa&s;t them: They al&s;o put off their Shooes at the Door, and never &s;pit upon the Pavement. No Females are admitted during their Im|purities, nor Wives that have known their Husbands, all the day following. In this none more Rigid then the Ancients, who only admoni&s;h'd &s;uch to Ab&s;tain from the Holy Communion.</P>
<P>Pictures they admit into their Churches; but as for Sta|tues or Sculptures Engraven or Ca&s;t, they abominate them, with the &s;ame antipathy as they do Idols. Perhaps becau&s;e they never had any in the Primitive times of the Church. For it was the Saying of the Ancients, <HI>Why &s;hould Men go about to make any likene&s;s of God, when Man him&s;elf was his Image, and no better could be made?</HI> And therefore it is a hei|nous
<PB N="288" REF="133">
Offence for any one to carry about them the Picture of Chri&s;t Crucify'd. However the Clergy carry bare Cro&s;&s;es in their hands, which they who meet them, reverence with a Ki&s;s; thereby Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. For they often &s;ign both them&s;elves, and the things that belong to them, with the Sign of the Cro&s;s, after the Cu&s;tom of the mo&s;t ancient Chri&s;tians; who were wont &s;o to do.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now proceed to the Sacred Ceremonies of the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> beginning with the fir&s;t initiation into Chri&s;tia|nity, <HI>Bapti&s;m.</HI> The Prie&s;t being to Baptize a Per&s;on or Per|&s;ons of full Age, which there many times happens, by rea&s;on of the frequent Conver&s;ion of the Heathen, begins with the 52 <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> then having Perfum'd the Per&s;ons with a Cen&s;or of Frankincen&s;e, he enquires the Names of them that are to be Baptiz'd. Then after the Recital of certain Prayers, the Deacon at the &s;ame time frequently Exhorting the Hearers to joyn with the Prie&s;t, he Anoints &s;everal parts of the Body with the Holy Oyl, and lays his Hand upon the <HI>Neophyte's</HI> Head. Which done, the <HI>Neophytes,</HI> lifting up their right Hands, and looking toward the We&s;t, abjure <HI>Satan,</HI> as the Prince of Darkne&s;s. Then turning to the Ea&s;t, as to the Sun of Ju&s;tice, and lifting up again their Right hands, they make as it were a kind of Vow to Chri&s;t; which don, they &s;ay over the Creed after the Prie&s;t, who putting the Que&s;tion, They an&s;wer, <HI>They do Believe.</HI> Which ended, the Parties again are anointed, and &s;ome certain pieces of Chapters are read out of the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John,</HI> the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, and the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul.</HI> At length the Oyl is &s;o pour'd into the Water prepar'd for the Bapti&s;m, as to re&s;emble in falling the Signature of the Cro&s;s, and after the Rehear&s;al of &s;everal other Prayers, the Prie&s;t de&s;cends into a certain Pool, made on pur|po&s;e before the Doors of the Church, whither the Per&s;ons being conducted by the Deacon, the Prie&s;t takes them, and plunges them three times over Head and Ears, &s;aying, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</HI> At the &s;ame time the Men have Men, the Women Women to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, who lending their Hands and Arms to their Friends, &s;upport them in going out of the Pool, and were therefore call'd <HI>Su&s;ceptores</HI> or <HI>Upholders</HI> by the Ancients. Be|ing thus wa&s;h'd, and once more anointed, they are fir&s;t
<PB N="289" REF="133">
clad with a White Under-garment, to &s;ignifie the Purity of the Mind; and over that, with a Red Ve&s;tment, in token of their Salvation purchas'd by the Blood of Chri&s;t; and &s;o introduc'd into the Church, where, being intermixed with Chri&s;tians, they are made Partakers of the Holy Commu|nion. At their departure they are pre&s;ented with Milk and Honey, and &s;o the Prie&s;t laying his Hand upon their Heads, di&s;mi&s;&s;es them with this Benediction, <HI>Sons of Bapti&s;m, go in Peace.</HI> For the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> frequently call the Chri&s;tians <HI>Velda Temqet, Sons of Bapti&s;m.</HI> All which Circum&s;tances are agree|able to the Rites of the Ancients. <HI>Let us thrice be plung'd,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Tertullian, and thence &s;upported, let us ta&s;t the Society of Milk and Honey.</HI> The&s;e are the Ceremonies ob&s;erv'd toward tho&s;e of ripe years.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of Baptizing Infants are much &s;horter. Males were formerly never Baptiz'd before the Fortieth day, Females before the Eightieth day, unle&s;s upon imminent danger of Death. But now they ha&s;ten Bapti&s;m much &s;ooner, e&s;pecially if the Infant be weak and &s;ickly. The Godfathers and Godmothers make an&s;wer to the Prie&s;t in their behalf. Nor are they plung'd in the Water, but only Sprinkl'd and Dipp'd, and that at the Entrance only of the Church; there being no admittance for them into the Church before Bapti&s;m. La&s;tly, Becau&s;e the Holy Com|munion is given to tho&s;e of riper years pre&s;ently after Bap|ti&s;m, therefore lea&s;t Infants &s;hould be in a wor&s;e Condition, in former times they dropt two or three drops out of the Sa|cred Cup, having crumbl'd a little piece of the Holy Bread into it before: to &s;hew there was the &s;ame regard to be had to them, as to tho&s;e of riper Age. Which being long ob&s;erv'd in the Latin Church, the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> together with the <HI>Armenians,</HI> ob&s;erve the Cu&s;tom to this day. <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, That they did no more than only dip the top of one of their Fingers in the Wine, and moi&s;ten the Childs tongue. Now that they u&s;e the &s;ame form of words with us, <HI>Alvarez</HI> is Po&s;itive, that is to &s;ay, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Fa|ther, and of the Son, and of the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Nor could I apprehend any otherwi&s;e out of their own Liturgies.</P>
<P>Which makes it more to be admir'd, what the Fathers of the Society, making no mention at all of this Form, have written into <HI>Europe,</HI> That &s;everal partly unwonted, partly frivolous Forms, and quite altering the E&s;&s;ence of Bapti&s;m,
<PB N="290" REF="134">
were made u&s;e of by the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Clergy: For Example, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the mo&s;t Holy Trinity; I Baptize thee in the Name of Chri&s;t; I Baptize thee in the Name of the Holy Gho&s;t</HI> only; <HI>I Baptize thee in the Water of</HI> Jordan; <HI>The Lord baptize thee; Let God wa&s;h thee; Let Bapti&s;m wa&s;h thee; Ble&s;&s;ed be the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> with &s;eve|ral others of the &s;ame Nature. For which rea&s;on they were con&s;train'd to Rebaptize many People, not permitted by the Catholic Church, but upon extraordinary occa&s;ions. So that at length they promi&s;cuou&s;ly Rebaptiz'd all the <HI>Habe&s;sinians,</HI> tho with this Condition, That the fir&s;t Bapti&s;m was not rightly perform'd, which drew upon them the Ha|tred and Envy of the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> Clergy.</P>
<P>Many Writers have believ'd, and reported, That the <HI>Ethi|opians</HI> were branded with a Mark after Bapti&s;m, in order to the fulfilling the words of <HI>St. John, He that cometh after me &s;hall Baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with fire.</HI> But <HI>Gregory</HI> him&s;elf deny'd any &s;uch Cu&s;tom, nor do the Fathers of the Society make any mention of it in their Writings. But this is certain, that the People of <HI>Africa,</HI> as well <HI>Gentils,</HI> as <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> do cauterize the Temple-Veins of Children newly Born, to pre&s;erve them from <HI>Catarrhs.</HI> Which being perhaps done by &s;ome of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> to the &s;ame end, was by &s;ome ignorant Foreigners taken for a Religious Ce|remony. As having heard that formerly there were a &s;ort of &s;illy Heretics, who mi&s;interpreting the word <HI>Fire,</HI> pro|perly &s;o taken, and wre&s;ting it to the Improper &s;ignifica|tion of Bapti&s;m, preferr'd the Cau&s;tic Signature of Fire, be|fore the Ceremony of wa&s;hing in Water.</P>
<P>But now for what concerns their <HI>Anniver&s;ary</HI> Bapti&s;m, with which the <HI>Abe&s;sines</HI> are &s;o much reproach'd, we are to give this Light. Upon the XI. of <HI>January,</HI> which with us is upon the Sixth, in the mid'&s;t of their Summer, and the Fea&s;t of the Epiphany, they keep a mo&s;t joyful Fe&s;tival in Commemoration of the Bapti&s;m of our Saviour, which with many of the Ancients, they certainly believe, was per|form'd upon that day. By the fir&s;t Dawn of the Morning Light, the Clergy begin the Solemnity with certain loud and chearful Hymns. The King with all the Nobility of the Court, the Metropolitan with the Clergy, Nobles and Plebeians, Old and Young, before Sun-ri&s;e, throng into the Rivers and Ponds, and there delight them&s;elves in the Wa|ter,
<PB N="291" REF="134">
plunging and diving over Head and Ears. As they meet any of the Prie&s;ts, they crave a Ble&s;&s;ing from them, who return them generally their de&s;ires in the&s;e words, <HI>God ble&s;s thee;</HI> or, <HI>God the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t ble&s;s thee.</HI> Hence it was that many believ'd that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> renew'd their Bapti&s;m every year. But as exce&s;s of Joy fre|quently begets wantonne&s;s; &s;o is it frequent for the Young men upon this day to leap, and dance, and &s;wim and duck one another; and by and by to fill the neighbouring Fields with Hoopings and Hallowings, the u&s;ual Con&s;equences of &s;uch kind of Sports. So that they make of it rather a day of Jollity, than a Pious Chri&s;tian Fe&s;tival. All this I relate from <HI>Gregorie</HI>'s own Lips. The Relation of <HI>Alvarez</HI> is quite different, as if it were a real Bapti&s;m, and that the Men and Women were at that time promi&s;cuou&s;ly rebaptiz'd. Whe|ther they did &s;o, or whether <HI>Alvarez</HI> rightly under&s;tood the words of the Baptizer, I very much que&s;tion. And yet I cannot but very much wonder at what <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, That at other times, and for &s;light cau&s;es, both Men and Women cau&s;e them&s;elves to be rebaptized, and that after a mo&s;t indecent manner. For &s;hould &s;uch a thing have been cu&s;tomary, King <HI>Ba&s;ilides</HI> would never have upbraided the Fathers with their reiteration of Bapti&s;m, &s;o frequently as he did. For my part, I never read or heard of any &s;uch thing. However, if any &s;uch thing were ever practis'd, it is to be attributed rather to the &s;tupid ignorance of the Prie&s;ts, then to allow'd Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>For in the la&s;t Century &s;uch was the mo&s;t mi&s;erable Condition of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs in <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> that nothing could be more deplorable: at what time, by rea|&s;on of the continual Inva&s;ions and Irruptions of the <HI>Gallans</HI> and <HI>Adelans,</HI> the People were di&s;pierc'd and &s;catter'd up and down the Mountains and Rocks, like a Flock without a Shepheard, without Law, and almo&s;t without either King or Metropolitan; all Sacred Wor&s;hip ceas'd; their Clergy were di&s;&s;ipated, and their Temples and Mona&s;teries every where ruin'd and burnt. What wonder then that <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Sloth</HI> &s;hould grow upon them? and that the illiterate Prie&s;ts, for want of Books, not to be &s;upply'd by Printing, and through the &s;carcity of Learned Men, &s;hould ra&s;hly ob|trude many things altogether Foreign from the Rites of their Ance&s;tors. For &s;uch Accidents frequently happen in great
<PB N="292" REF="135">
Calamities, when Bi&s;hops and Princes cannot perform, or el&s;e grow carele&s;s of their Offices; when little regarding their own Eternal Salvation, they leave that to fate, or the plea&s;ure of every private Per&s;on, which &s;hould be their chief and principal care. Such was the Sluggi&s;hne&s;s that overwhelm'd all <HI>Greece,</HI> in the time of <HI>Maurice</HI> the Empe|ror; &s;o that neither <HI>Gregory</HI> under&s;tood Greek, nor any one at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> could under&s;tand Latin, &s;uch was the mi&s;ery of that Age, in the Latin Church, as <HI>Baronius</HI> te&s;tifies, when nothing but meer Barbari&s;m and Ignorance Triumph'd, when all Arts and Vertuous Studies were Exil'd, and only Vice prevail'd in Church and State. At that time there was a certain Prie&s;t, who neither like a Latini&s;t, nor a Chri&s;tian, had Baptiz'd &s;everal Infants in <HI>Nomine Patria, &amp; Filia, &amp; Spi|ritual Sancta,</HI> which Bapti&s;m was however confirm'd by <HI>Za|charias</HI> the Pope, by rea&s;on of the good intention of the <HI>Baptizer.</HI></P>
<P>That Sinners after Bapti&s;m are reconcil'd to God and the Church, they make no Que&s;tion: However they teach that there mu&s;t be a Repentance for the&s;e Sins, and that Re|pentance to be made known by Confe&s;&s;ion. But to enume|rate all and &s;ingular their particular Sins, with all their cir|cum&s;tances, they think it neither commanded of God, nor at all nece&s;&s;ary. And therefore, they only &s;ay in general words to the Prie&s;t, <HI>Ab&s;an, Ab&s;an, we have Sinn'd, we have Sinn'd.</HI> So that when the <HI>Roman</HI> Prie&s;ts pre&s;s'd them to par|ticular Confe&s;&s;ion, they never acknowledg'd any more than three, if they had been guilty, <HI>Homicide, Adultery,</HI> and <HI>Theft.</HI> To confe&s;s any more they could not be induc'd without great difficulty. The Offender is Ab&s;olv'd in very few words, together with &s;ome gentle &s;tripes upon the Side with an Olive twigg, which is thought &s;ufficient to de|liver him from the Power of <HI>Satan.</HI> But as for them that have committed any of tho&s;e great Crimes before-named, they are not only cha&s;tiz'd with &s;evere Reprehen&s;ion and bitter Language, but many times al&s;o &s;everely Scourg'd, to the end they may not only hear, but be &s;en&s;ible of their Ab|&s;olution. <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, That the Metropolitan &s;ome|times hears Confe&s;&s;ions him&s;elf; and that when he un|der&s;tands the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime, he ri&s;es up, and after a &s;harp rebuke of the Penitent, he cryes out, <HI>Ha&s;t thou done this? Do&s;t thou not fear God? Go too, let him be Scourg'd
<PB N="293" REF="135">
thirty or forty times.</HI> Pre&s;ently the Executioners are ready, who &s;treight prepare their Scourges, and give the mi&s;era|ble Sinner &s;ix or &s;even cutting la&s;hes; the re&s;t being remit|ted at the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Standers by. There was one who to avoid &s;o &s;harp an Ab&s;olution of his Crime, re|que&s;ted of the Metropolitan &s;itting in his Seat of Judicature, that he might make his Confe&s;&s;ion in Private; to whom the Metropolitan, <HI>How! Shall not thy Sin be made manife&s;t at the la&s;t day, before all the World?</HI> Tell therefore, <HI>what it is?</HI> The unfortunate Offender believing it his duty to obey, openly confe&s;s'd, it was the <HI>&s;tealing of Oxen.</HI> By chance the Owner of the Oxen was there; who being glad that he had appre|hended the Thief, pre&s;ently accus'd him, &s;o that the poor Fel|low being Convicted of the Fact by his own Confe&s;&s;ion before &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es, was con&s;train'd to re&s;tore the Oxen, and undergo a &s;evere Puni&s;hment be&s;ide.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> are generally of a &s;oft and mild Di&s;|po&s;ition, for the mo&s;t part, &s;o &s;oon as they have committed any notable Offence, they pre&s;ently run to their Confe&s;&s;ors, and confe&s;&s;ing they have &s;inn'd, de&s;ire to receive the Com|munion for the quiet of their Con&s;ciences. But this they do not do, till they come to be at lea&s;t Five and twenty years of Age. For till then they prolong their years of Indi&s;cretion, pretending Childi&s;h Innocence. So that if a Young man die before he be Twenty years old, they bewail him in the&s;e words, <HI>Oh! let my Soul be like the Soul of this Innocent.</HI> So great a Confidence they have in the hone&s;t Inclinations of their Youth.</P>
<P>The whole Divine Service of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> is compleated by the &s;ole Admini&s;tration of the Sacrament, and reading &s;ome few broken parcels of Chapters out of the New Te|&s;tament: for they neither make u&s;e of Sacred Hymns nor of Preaching. Which when we &s;eem'd to wonder at, <HI>Gre|gory</HI> ask'd me, <HI>Whether we thought our Preachers could &s;peak any thing better then what was written in the Sacred Scripture, or the Homilies of the Fathers of the Primitive Church? Whe|ther we thought their Sayings more efficacious than the Word of God? Whether we did not fear, le&s;t tho&s;e Preachers &s;hould utter &s;omething which might be repugnant to our Faith and Salvation, which might prove of dangerous Con&s;equence, e&s;pecially among the Plebeian and ru&s;tic &s;ort of People?</HI> We an&s;wer'd, That the Wor&s;hip of God requir'd it; and that the u&s;e and end of
<PB N="294" REF="136">
Preaching was at large &s;et forth in Scripture; to the end we might under&s;tand the benefit of them. But the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> to &s;upply this defect, have Compos'd &s;everal Li|turgies and Homilies, of which mention has been already made. To the&s;e they add &s;everal Portions of Scripture u&s;ually appointed to be read, which are fourfold, out of the Evangeli&s;ts, the Acts, the Epi&s;tles of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Canonical Epi&s;tles; to which they give the Titles of <HI>Wengel,</HI> the <HI>Evangils, Gheber,</HI> the <HI>Acts, Paulus,</HI> and <HI>Hawarja</HI> the Apo&s;tle. But in the general Liturgy, which they call <HI>Canon Keda&s;i,</HI> the <HI>Canon of the Ma&s;s,</HI> there are all their Cere|monies to be found, with all their Prayers accu&s;tom'd to be apply'd to the &s;everal Varieties of Duties to be perform'd; all their In&s;truments and Ve&s;&s;els being &s;anctify'd by certain Prayers and Ejaculations. For in the Sanctuary &s;tands the <HI>Holy Table,</HI> which they call <HI>Kede&s;at Terphez,</HI> vulgarly <HI>Manbar.</HI> It differs from their Common Tables, for that you may go round about it, and place what you plea&s;e upon it. Only it is cover'd with a Canopy, &s;u&s;tain'd with four Pillars at each Corner. Upon this they place the Sacred Ve&s;&s;els. Fir&s;t the <HI>Tabot,</HI> or <HI>Chest:</HI> A little Table &s;o call'd; but the rea&s;on why, I never yet could find; for that it has no re|&s;emblance of a Che&s;t; it being an Oblong Quadrangular Table, upon which the Di&s;h and the Cup are &s;et; and therefore I mu&s;t repair to conjecture, which I &s;hall willingly &s;ubmit to the Judgment of the Learned.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t ancient Chri&s;tians, when for almo&s;t three Ages together, they could not have the Opportunity of Admini|&s;tring or receiving the Communion in Public, were con|&s;train'd to take their Opportunities in Dens and Caves; but for the mo&s;t part in the Church-yards, in the &s;ilence of the Night. To which purpo&s;e, they either carry'd the Bread, Wine, Cup, and other Uten&s;ils wrapp'd up in Linnen, or otherwi&s;e conceal'd to the place where the Congregation met. Whence it &s;eems very probable to me, that they might make u&s;e of the Coffins them&s;elves, or &s;ome Che&s;t in the fa&s;hion of a Bier, to conveigh their Sacred Uten&s;ils, under the pretence of carrying forth their Dead. Which Che&s;t being thus conveigh'd into the Church-yard or Cave where they met, &s;erv'd al&s;o in&s;tead of a Table, about which the Communicants &s;ate, and receiv'd in their Order. If they found any Bones of the Holy Martyrs &s;catter'd about,
<PB N="295" REF="136">
they gather'd them up, and put them up in this Che&s;t, which Cu&s;tom in after Ages became a Law. If they were driven from their Habitations, or con&s;train'd for fear of Tyrannical fury to &s;eek new abodes, this Che&s;t was &s;till carry'd from place to place, where the Bi&s;hop or Presbyter re&s;ided, who was to perform the Sacred Duty. And thus they came to be call'd either Che&s;ts by their proper Names, or Tables in reference to their U&s;e, the Name of Altar growing out of Mind. For &s;o <HI>Minutius Felix; D'ye think,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>that we conceal the Deity whom we &s;erve, becau&s;e we have not Temples and Altars,</HI> properly &s;o call'd? Afterwards they began in re&s;pect of the Oblations to be call'd Altars. But in proce&s;s of Time, when the Sacrament came to be Admi|ni&s;ter'd without controul, there happen'd a great Change. For that &s;ome thought it not lawful to perform the Sacred Duty, otherwhere then at tho&s;e wooden Che&s;ts, which long Cu&s;tom had now made <HI>Religious.</HI> And therefore being brought forth of the Caves where they had been Con&s;ecra|ted, they were &s;et apart for the Admini&s;tration of the Eu|chari&s;t; and it is not unlikely, that in regard they were to be plac'd upon low Tables, they were made the more plain, and the le&s;&s;er, that they might be more fit for u&s;e; till at length they came to be made like the Tables them&s;elves; &s;o that now the form being chang'd, the name only ap|pears among the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> But after that, when Chri&s;tians began to rear great and &s;tately Fabricks, tho&s;e Arks or Che&s;ts together with the Tables, were plac'd in the Sanctuary; and in mo&s;t Churches the Name of <HI>Table</HI> remain'd; but in Latin Church the Name of <HI>Altar,</HI> as the more worthy and decent Appellation prevail'd.</P>
<P>But this was an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Cu&s;tom among the Ancients, That the Ba&s;is upon which the Sacred Ve&s;&s;els were to be &s;et, &s;hould be fir&s;t con&s;ecrated. Whence it came to pa&s;s, that the <HI>Tables</HI> or <HI>Altars</HI> them&s;elves were con&s;ecra|ted; and &s;o the u&s;e of tho&s;e Arks or Che&s;ts ceas'd. But where there were no Altars, or that the que&s;tion was, whe|ther they were con&s;ecrated or no, there the Greeks had their <HI>Antimen&s;ae,</HI> or little Crickets; the Latins, their <HI>Portalia</HI> or &s;mall Portative Tables, which they &s;et upon tho&s;e Altars that were not con&s;ecrated. But for the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> they make u&s;e of their Che&s;t and their Table both together; to the end the Service may be the more fully and ab&s;olutely
<PB N="296" REF="137">
perform'd, and nothing left undon. Now in regard the&s;e Che&s;ts were formerly made of Wood, it was not material what &s;ort of Wood. But after the Popes had commanded that the Altars &s;hould be made of <HI>Parget,</HI> the little Porta|tive Altar was al&s;o made of the &s;ame matter, for that rea&s;on call'd <HI>Lapis Sacratus,</HI> or the <HI>Con&s;ecrated Stone.</HI> The little Che&s;t which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> u&s;e, is generally of Wood, though they do not Prohibit tho&s;e that are made of Stone, or ca&s;t Metal. However the Fathers of the Society would not permit them to make u&s;e of any but of Stone; the re&s;t they either burnt or melted down.</P>
<P>Now the better to &s;upport and give credit to Conjecture, and to &s;hew that the Primitive Chri&s;tians had be&s;ides their plain and fix'd Tables, real Che&s;ts, like Che&s;ts of Drawers, we &s;hall produce a Marble Monument digg'd up in one of the Chri&s;tian Church-yards.

Neither am I apt to believe that they who &s;ate about it were celebrating their <HI>Love Fea&s;ts,</HI> but the Holy Commu|nion. Which is plain from the Sacred Loaves that are there repre&s;ented, &s;ign'd with a <HI>Saltir Cro&s;s,</HI> which the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> &s;till u&s;e in the Holy Communion. <HI>Thuanus,</HI> it &s;eems, &s;aw one of tho&s;e &s;ort of Altars, when he came to <HI>Aux</HI> in the Province of <HI>Armagnac,</HI> and de&s;cribes them to be like certain Che&s;ts. <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>we view'd the Temple of St.</HI> Orentius, <HI>of most re|mote Antiquity, where we beheld &s;everal Altars plac'd up and down in the Temple, being the Coffins of the Martyrs, round about which the Chri&s;tians formerly held their Meetings; not plain and level like our Tables, but ri&s;ing with a kind of Gibbo&s;ity, in the manner of a Trunk lidd: which were marked with two Greek Letters, (&khgr;.&khgr;.) repre&s;ent|ing the Name of Chri&s;t.</HI> With <HI>Thuanus</HI> agrees <HI>Gabriel Biel,</HI> who di&s;cour&s;ing of Wooden Altars, <HI>Nor is it contradictory,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>to what has bin &s;aid before, that there is a wooden Altar in the Lateran Church, which Altar is pre&s;erv'd out of a par|ticular Reverence to the Prince of Apo&s;tles, and the preceding Holy Martyrs, who were &s;aid to have Celebrated the Holy Commu|nion upon that Altar. This Altar was fix'd by Bi&s;hop</HI> Silve&s;ter, <HI>to the end that no Per&s;on, unle&s;s the Pope him&s;elf &s;hould pre&s;ume to make u&s;e of it, for the Celebration of Divine Service.

<HI>fix'd Epi&s;copal See, So that they were forc'd to perform holy Duties either in Caves or other private places upon a wooden Altar, in the form of a hollow Che&s;t, which was carry'd about by the Prie&s;ts, where|ever the</HI> Roman <HI>Bi&s;hop kept his &s;ecret Habitation.</HI> Which is confirm'd by <HI>Father Tellez,</HI> who thus writes, where he Di&s;cour&s;es concerning the <HI>Chest</HI> made u&s;e of by the <HI>Ethio|pians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moreover 'tis well known, that in the Infancy of the Catholic Church, the Altars were of Wood, like little Che&s;ts, and there were no other Altars of Stone, till the time that</HI> Silve&s;ter <HI>began to Con&s;e|crate Altars of kind. However he left remaining in the Cathedral of St.</HI> Peters, <HI>others &s;ay in St.</HI> John Laterano, <HI>a little wooden Che&s;t, which for &s;o many years had bin the Altar which &s;o many Pious Popes had made u&s;e of, and upon which it is not law|ful at this day for any Per&s;on but the Pope him&s;elf to Ce|lebrate.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Studious Reader may perceive frequent men|tion to have bin made of the&s;e <HI>Che&s;ts;</HI> and if the <HI>little Che&s;t</HI> of which <HI>Tellez</HI> has given us a Relation, be &s;till Extant at <HI>Rome,</HI> there can be no room left for any farther doubt concerning the Matter or the Form: and our Conjecture concerning their Original will &s;tand good, till the Learned &s;hall give us better Information. Now, that the <HI>Martyrs</HI> Bones were anciently put into the&s;e <HI>Che&s;ts,</HI> we gather from the <HI>Council of Carthage,</HI> which approves and confirms the Cu&s;tom. For &s;o runs the 14 Canon of the <HI>Fifth</HI> by Name, but <HI>Third</HI> in Order of Time. The Altars, <HI>In which</HI> (he doth not &s;ay <HI>above,</HI> nor <HI>under) there are no Reliques of Martyrs, &s;hall be remov'd.</HI> Neither could tho&s;e Bones be di&s;pos'd of in Tables, nor in the Altars, &s;o call'd, of the Ancients. And in this we have bin the more prolix, to the end the Original and U&s;e of the <HI>Ethiopic Chest,</HI> appropriated to the Communion, might be the better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The other holy Ve&s;&s;els are <HI>Pahal,</HI> the <HI>Di&s;h, Tzevae,</HI> the <HI>Cup,</HI> and Spoon for di&s;tribution of the Wine, call'd <HI>Eref Ma&s;|kel,</HI> the <HI>Spoon of the Cro&s;s;</HI> by rea&s;on that the handle ends in a little Cro&s;s. Be&s;ides the&s;e, they have their con&s;ecrated <HI>Urns</HI> and <HI>Cen&s;ors,</HI> in regard they frequently fume with Frankin|cen&s;e, which Nece&s;&s;ity con&s;train'd them to do while they were forc'd to make u&s;e of Caves and Subterraneal Places.</P>
<P>In the Admini&s;tration of the Sacrament, they u&s;e a &s;ort of leaven'd Bread (as was done in the Latin Church for many
<PB N="298" REF="139">
Ages) Mark'd with a Cro&s;s &cross;, imprinted into the Ma&s;s of the Loaf. This Bread they call <HI>Korban,</HI> and Bake it new every day, admiring at the Latins for keeping their Holy Bread till the Morrow. But upon the Fifth Holy-day of the great Week, in Memory of Chri&s;t's unleaven'd Loaves, they al&s;o u&s;e unleaven'd Bread; pieces of which the Prie&s;t di&s;tributes to the Communicants. For they all participate of one Loaf. The Wine is by the <HI>Deacon</HI> given out of the Cup in a Spoon indifferently to all, as well Layety, as Cler|gy. True it is, they want real Wine; the defect of which they &s;upply by &s;teeping the bruis'd Stones of <HI>Rai&s;ins</HI> in Water, and then &s;queezing and &s;training the Infu&s;ion, which makes a kind of <HI>Rai&s;in</HI> Liquor. Yet not believing it thus made to be &s;mall enough, the <HI>Subdeacon</HI> pours a Spoonful or two of Water into the hollow of the Communicants hand, with which he fir&s;t wa&s;hes his mouth, and after that, &s;ups it up. <HI>Tellez</HI> will not allow this Liquor to be other then meer Wa|ter; and for that rea&s;on laughs at the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> for believ|ing they Communicate in both kinds, when they Commu|nicate in neither; tho the Fathers of the Society, for want of Wine, were forc'd to u&s;e the &s;ame Liquor in the former Age. Which <HI>Sandovall</HI> calls a Holy and Provident In|vention. Mo&s;t certain it is that many Countreys, e&s;pecially inhabited by barbarous People, and remote from the Sea, are de&s;titute of Wine; as the <HI>Copts</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the Chri&s;tians of the Order of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>India.</HI> Nay, &s;ome there were, who were put to harder &s;hifts than all this: having no other way but to dip a linnen Cloth in Wine, when they could come at it, and dry it again. This Cloath they kept very charily, and when they had an occa&s;ion to Admini&s;ter the Sacrament, they moi&s;ten'd a part of the Cloath in water, and wrung the moi&s;ture out again with their hands. Which wa|ter &s;o reli&s;h'd and tinctur'd, they gave to the People.</P>
<P>The&s;e Shifts Pope <HI>Julius</HI> condemns, however in a ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity, he permits the clu&s;ter it &s;elf to be &s;queez'd into the Cup, and the Liquor to be mix'd with water.</P>
<P>The time of receiving the Sacrament, is left to every man's liberty; &s;ome receive every Week, &s;ome every Month; but always within the Church. For they hold it a great Sin to carry the Holy My&s;teries out of the Church into private Hou&s;es: Neither does the King, nor the Metropolitan a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves that Priviledge. They never &s;pit,
<PB N="299" REF="139">
that day they have receiv'd. They al&s;o receive Fa&s;ting, and toward the Evening too, if it be a fa&s;ting day.</P>
<P>But now to Admini&s;ter the Sacrament in large and crowd|ed Churches, and upon Solemn days, it requires four or five Men at lea&s;t. <HI>Bahen,</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;t;</HI> or <HI>Ka&s;is,</HI> the <HI>Presbyter. Nefek Ka&s;is,</HI> the <HI>Sub-Presbyter; Daj-kan,</HI> the <HI>Deacon;</HI> and <HI>Nefeh Dajkan,</HI> the <HI>Sub-Deacon.</HI> There are al&s;o pre&s;ent other A&s;&s;i&s;tants, to hold the Candles, and to attend upon the Prie&s;ts. The&s;e every one taking his particular part, per|form the whole Duty, reading of &s;everal Prayers, as the va|riety of Action, and the u&s;e of di&s;tinct Ve&s;&s;els require. La&s;tly, they recommend both the <HI>Living</HI> and the <HI>Dead</HI> to God, which they call <HI>receiving the Dapdukon,</HI> the <HI>Diptych,</HI> or <HI>Church Regi&s;ter;</HI> which among the Ancient Greeks, con&s;i&s;ted of two Tables, wherein the Name of tho&s;e were written, who were to be Pray'd for in the Regi&s;ter. There are &s;ome that bring their Offerings to the Holy Table, as Bread, Oyl, Tithes, fir&s;t Fruits, and the like; which at the Conclu&s;ion of the Sacrament, are di&s;tributed to the Poor. Which I take to be under&s;tood of that ancient Cu&s;tom mention'd by <HI>Clau|dius,</HI> in his <HI>Confe&s;sion of Faith. Vangaber Bat Me&s;ah, that day,</HI> meaning the Sabbath, we make a Charitable Fea&s;t. The&s;e Holydaies they keep two days every Week; that is to &s;ay, upon the Sabaoth and the Lord's-Day. That they call <HI>San|bat Ejehude,</HI> which they &s;ay they celebrate in commemora|tion of the profe&s;&s;ed Creation, and therefore they do not keep it &s;o &s;olemnly as the Lord's-Day. But upon the Lord's-Day, which they call <HI>Sanbat Ehad,</HI> or the Sabbath of the fir&s;t Holyday; or <HI>Ehude,</HI> the <HI>fir&s;t Holyday,</HI> &s;ingly, or <HI>Sanbat Chri|&s;tejan,</HI> the Chri&s;tians Sabbath, they keep after the cu&s;tom of the Catholic Church, and read over all the Offices and Ser|vices requir'd.</P>
<P>They have no Bells of Bra&s;s, or mix'd Metal like ours; in|&s;tead of which, they only u&s;e a kind of hollow Ve&s;&s;els re&s;embling Bells, made of Iron, Stone, or Wood, more for Noi&s;e, than delightful to the Ear. Neither is their Church Mu&s;ic any thing more plea&s;ing. For be&s;ides that, the Voices of their Singing Prie&s;ts, whom they call <HI>Dabetra,</HI> are very har&s;h and ungrateful, the In&s;truments they make u&s;e of after the <HI>Egyptian</HI> manner, &s;uch as Cimbals, Morrice Bells, and Kettle Drums, which the Grandees them&s;elves think no di&s;honour to rattle upon tho&s;e Solemnities, are no
<PB N="300" REF="140">
way agreeable to the Harmony of <HI>Europe.</HI> With their Mu&s;ic they u&s;e Skipping and Dancing, in imitation of <HI>David</HI> Dancing before the Ark of the Covenant. At what time they make the Floor ring again after &s;uch a rude manner, that you would believe them rather at a Wedding, than at a Chri&s;tian Solemni|ty. This they call <HI>exulting, rejoycing,</HI> and <HI>clapping hands to the God of</HI> Jacob, as they are commanded in the P&s;alms; and this they call Prai&s;ing God upon the Harp and Organ, and with <HI>Cymbals,</HI> tho it cannot be &s;aid they are &s;o &s;weet &s;ounding as tho&s;e in <HI>David</HI>'s Time may be imagin'd to be. Which things tho they &s;eem to us, not to corre&s;pond with the gra|vity of Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, yet will not they much admire, who well know, that in &s;ome places among the Latins, the Fea&s;t of the Body of God was &s;olemniz'd with Dancing; which as it could not be done without Mu&s;ic, there were others that play'd in di&s;gui&s;e before the Dancers upon Harps.</P>
<P>Fa&s;ting days are no where more exactly ob&s;erv'd. Not that they ab&s;tain from &s;ome Meats, and gluttonize upon others. For that they look upon as a mockery of Fa&s;ting. For they keep them&s;elves whole dayes without either Food or Drink, even till Sun&s;et of the third Evening. Others there are that ab&s;tain the two Holydaies of the Pa&s;&s;ion Week. The Monks put them&s;elves upon greater Extremities than all this; by which means they not only mortifie but de&s;troy. Be&s;ides all which they fa&s;t twice in &s;even days, upon the Fourth and Sixth Holyday, like the re&s;t of the Ea&s;tern Churches. The rea&s;on of which was by <HI>Tzagazaab</HI> &s;aid to be, for that the Fourth day the Murther of Chri&s;t was concluded upon, and the Sixth it was executed; according to what many of the Ancients taught. But we believe that the&s;e two Fa&s;ting-days, as many other things, were admitted and ob&s;erv'd in imi|tation of the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Primitive Chri&s;tians, who were ei|ther <HI>Jews,</HI> or el&s;e had learn't from the <HI>Jews,</HI> that this Cu&s;tom was introduc'd and us'd as a Duty both Pious and Nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e times. For the <HI>Jews</HI> fa&s;ted twice in a Week; which is that which the Phari&s;ee boa&s;ted, <HI>I fa&s;t twice upon the Sab|bath,</HI> that is within the two days in &s;even, <HI>viz.</HI> upon the Se|cond and Fifth Holyday; which the Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they would not fa&s;t upon the &s;ame day with the <HI>Jews,</HI> alter'd for the Fourth and Sixth. Afterwards <HI>Innocent,</HI> and <HI>Gregory</HI> the Seventh, abrogating the Fa&s;t of the Fourth Holyday, im|pos'd
<PB N="301" REF="140">
Ab&s;tinence from Fle&s;h upon <HI>Sunday,</HI> not minding the ancient Canon, <HI>If any Clergy-man &s;hall be known to Fa&s;t upon any Sabbath or Lord's-Day, one excepted, let him be &s;u&s;pended from his Office.</HI></P>
<P>That one Sabbath is <HI>Ea&s;ter Eve.</HI> Otherwi&s;e to fa&s;t upon the Lord's-Day, the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> account it Criminal, like the ancient Chri&s;tians; as <HI>Tertullian</HI> witne&s;&s;es. Be&s;ides the&s;e, and other Fa&s;ts of the Ea&s;tern Church, they ob&s;erve in the fir&s;t place, the Forty days <HI>Lent,</HI> which they make up Fifty. For it begins Ten days before the Roman <HI>Lent;</HI> That is, upon the &s;econd Holyday after <HI>Sexage&s;ima Sunday.</HI> And this as a Command of God, they ob&s;erve both healthy and &s;ick Peo|ple, mo&s;t exactly and religiou&s;ly; only as we &s;aid before, upon <HI>Sundays</HI> they eat Fle&s;h. After <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> they &s;upply the pinching hard&s;hip and &s;obriety of the pa&s;t Weeks with the Jollity and Mirth of tho&s;e that &s;ucceed. For during all the time of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> &s;o formerly was the interval of the Fifty days call'd, (from the Fea&s;t of the Re&s;urrection till the Fea&s;t of tending the Holy Go&s;t) they &s;pend their time in all manner of Fea&s;ting and Jocundry, &s;uitable to the Country. All that time, as of old with the Latins, &s;o among the <HI>Ethi|opians,</HI> being &s;till ob&s;erv'd as one continu'd Fe&s;tival. <HI>Gregory</HI> con&s;idering the&s;e things, and admiring that the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Germany</HI> ob&s;erv'd no other Fa&s;ts, but what were command|ed by their Princes in ca&s;e of Public Calamity, was an|&s;wer'd out of St. <HI>Ambro&s;e; we do not Fa&s;t becau&s;e the Lord abi|deth with us, not only tho&s;e Fifty days, but all the year long, nay as long as we live.</HI> Thus Chri&s;t an&s;wer'd them, who objected to his Di&s;ciples.</P>
<P><HI>Can the Sons of the Bridegroom mourn while the Bridegroom is among them. But the time &s;hall come, that the Bridegroom &s;hall be taken from them, and then they &s;hall fa&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the ancient Chri&s;tians, when tho&s;e days came that Chri&s;t had foretold, that is to &s;ay, the days of Per&s;ecu|tion and Affliction, did well and truly in that they frequent|ly fa&s;ted. But we, in regard our Bridegroom is return'd with his favour and his Grace, and has re&s;tor'd Peace and Tran|quillity to his Church, have no need to ob&s;erve &s;et Fa&s;ts as nece&s;&s;ary; but to &s;ay with St. <HI>Ambro&s;e, That true Fasting is an alienation from Incontinency of Language, Suppre&s;sion of wrath and ill De&s;ires, and Ab&s;tinence from Slander and Reproach.</HI> And with St. <HI>Au&s;tin, The Great and General Fa&s;ting is to ab&s;tain

from Iniquity, and the unlawful Plea&s;ures of the Age, which is per|fect Fa&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Sabbath and Lord's-Day, they ob&s;erve all the chief and ancient Fe&s;tivals of the Catholic Church; The <HI>Annunciation, Nativity, Circumci&s;ion, Bapti&s;m, Pa&s;sion, Re&s;ur|rection, A&s;cen&s;ion,</HI> and the <HI>De&s;cen&s;ion</HI> of the Holy Gho&s;t, call'd <HI>Bagnab Arbgna,</HI> or the Fea&s;t of Forty days; as al&s;o that mo&s;t ancient Fe&s;tival of the Primitive Church call'd <HI>Rakeb,</HI> in the Middle of the Penteco&s;t, by the Latins call'd <HI>Cantate,</HI> at what time the Bi&s;hops are commanded to a&s;&s;emble a Synod, by the Canons commonly call'd <HI>Apostolical.</HI> As for the other Fe&s;tivals, which were introduc'd by the <HI>Kopts, Greeks</HI> or <HI>Latins,</HI> after the Variances of the Council of <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> &s;ome they admit, &s;ome they receive, according as they think mo&s;t agreeable to their Religion.</P>
<P>They begin in the year from the Calends of <HI>September,</HI> with the <HI>Greeks, Armenians, Ru&s;sians,</HI> and other Oriental Chri&s;tians. For they believe that the World was created at the time of the Autumnal Equinoctial. They farther al&s;o compute Five thou&s;and and five hundred years to the <HI>Nativi|ty,</HI> Eight years le&s;s than the Greeks, and they who follow the Tran&s;lation of the <HI>Seventy Interpreters,</HI> from whence that Computation was made. The Supputation of the Chri&s;tians is the &s;ame, which <HI>Scaliger</HI> &s;ays was therefore don, becau&s;e the Chri&s;tians believe the World to be le&s;s ancient by Eight years then the Greeks do, but he does not apply his rea&s;on home. We are apt to believe it came to pa&s;s through &s;ome erroneous Sub&s;traction of the years of the World. For that finding perhaps that the Greeks, to perfect the Calculation of the Years of Chri&s;t, had &s;ub&s;tracted 5508 years of the World; they al&s;o did the &s;ame, forgetting that tho&s;e Eight years were already wanting; or el&s;e having &s;ettl'd the years of Chri&s;t, according to the Greek Computation, and coming afterwards to reform the Age of the World, they found the&s;e Eight years to be over and above. However it fall out, let any one year of Chri&s;t be granted by them, Eight years mu&s;t be added to their Computation, if you de&s;ire to know the agreeing time of any certain Tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Their year con&s;i&s;ts of Twelve Months, as among us; But each Month, as among the <HI>Egyptians</HI> having but Thirty days; therefore to &s;upply the <HI>Solar</HI> Year, to every Three years they add Five days, to every Four years Six days; which by
<PB N="303" REF="141">
a word borrow'd from the Greek they call <HI>Pagomen.</HI> Hence it happens, that their Fea&s;ts go according to the <HI>Julian</HI> Ac|compt, and fall upon the &s;ame days; yet are otherwi&s;e number'd. For the Fea&s;t of the Nativity of Chri&s;t is cele|brated the &s;ame day with us, which happens among the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> u&s;ing the <HI>Julian</HI> Accompt, to be upon the 25 of <HI>De|cember,</HI> but with them falls upon the 28 of <HI>December.</HI> Nei|ther did the Catholic Church in any part of the World ever ob&s;erve it upon any other days; So that it is to be admir'd that <HI>Scaliger</HI> &s;hould go about to Tran&s;late it into Autumn. It is farther ob&s;ervable, that to the &s;pace of Four years they give the Denomination of one of the Evangeli&s;ts; it being the Cu&s;tom to fini&s;h the reading of one Evange|li&s;t quite through in that time. Which is the rea&s;on that in &s;ome of their Chronological Computations, you &s;hall find added, <HI>in the days of</HI> Mark, <HI>in the days of</HI> John <HI>the Evan|geli&s;t,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Nuptial Rites, mo&s;t certain it is, that <HI>Polygamy</HI> is not allow'd by the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Church, however it be tolerated by the Civil Magi&s;trate. For they that Marry more than one are not puni&s;h'd by the Magi&s;trates; yet they are prohibited from the Holy Sacrament: as be|ing of tho&s;e &s;ort of People, that do no injury to the Com|mon-wealth, but only contradict the Rules of Chri&s;tian Sanctity; as if it were not the Office or Duty of Kings and Princes, but of the Bi&s;hops of the Church to make Men God|ly and Chri&s;tianly vertuous. This <HI>Alvarez</HI> a&s;&s;erts upon his own Knowledge: Who&s;e Ho&s;t at <HI>Dobarra</HI> had Three Wives which had brought him Seven and thirty Children; for which there was no other notice taken of him, but only that he was not admitted to the Church, or to the Com|munion, until he at la&s;t put Two of them away. Here it may not be improper to inquire how the Metropolitan be|haves him&s;elf toward their Kings, who have more Wives than one. For the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> Kings, by vertue of an old Ill cu&s;tom, be&s;ides &s;everal Wives lawfully Marry'd, are not a&s;ham'd to keep &s;everal Concubines; as if they did it in imitation of <HI>Solomon,</HI> from whom they boa&s;t their De&s;cent. True it is, That the Fathers of the Society would not grant Ab&s;olution to <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> before he had di&s;mi&s;s'd all his Super|numerary Wives, retaining only the fir&s;t. Indeed it is to me no &s;mall wonder, that the Laws of the Church, and the
<PB N="304" REF="142">
Kingdom &s;hould no better agree; that the one &s;hould be &s;o loo&s;e in point of Marriages, the other &s;o &s;trict; e&s;pecially where the di&s;pute ari&s;es, not &s;o much as to the Matter, as to the Name. Thus we find the Marriages of Kindred for|bidden, even to di&s;tant degrees; for that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> want|ing terms of di&s;tinction, call one another all by the Names of Brothers and Si&s;ters. Thus a Church-man may not Mar|ry his Brother's Wife, but a Lay Per&s;on may. However no Marriages but tho&s;e that are approv'd by Divine Autho|rity, are honour'd with Sacerdotal Benediction; nor tho&s;e neither publickly in the Church, unle&s;s they be &s;uch Clergy|men, to whom the <HI>Hallelujah</HI> is Sung. Other People are Marry'd either at home, or before the Dores of the Church. However all Secular Per&s;ons have al&s;o this Priviledge, that they can throw off the Yoke when they plea&s;e. For upon any &s;light Difference between a Man and his Wife, if they cannot be reconcil'd, the King's Judges pre&s;ently di&s;&s;olve the Marriage. But as for the Clergy, if it be their de&s;ire to put away their Wives, or to Marry another, the fir&s;t being Deceas'd, they are oblig'd to renounce their Function. Where|by it happens, that their Marriages are much more peaceful, and more durable.</P>
<P>To conclude with their Burials, the Dead Bodies being well wa&s;h'd and &s;um'd with Incen&s;e, they wrap them up in proper Garments.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Con&s;titution and Form of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Go|vernment in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as al&s;o of the Priviledges of the Clergy.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Clergy enjoy no immunity. Their Head or <HI>Abuna</HI> created by the Metropolitan of <HI>Alexandria.</HI> His Place in Councils. The pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church deplorable. The Clergy ignorant, the Pa|triarch Illiterate. The <HI>Habe&s;&s;ine</HI> Metropolitans ordain the Clergy only. No Bi&s;hops, nor Arch-Bi&s;hops. The <HI>Icegue</HI> governs the Monks. They acknowledge but four Oecumenical Patriarchs. The Catalogue of Metro|politans incertain.

The Clergy Marry, but not twice.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE have already declar'd, That the Supream Power in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs, is inve&s;ted in the King. Therefore all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cau&s;es, except only in very &s;light Matters, are all determin'd by the King's Judges. Neither do the <HI>Clergy</HI> or <HI>Monks</HI> enjoy any &s;ort of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Immunity, or Priviledge of Exemption. Nor does the Canon, <HI>Siquis &s;uadente diabolo, hujus Sacrilegii reatum incurrerit, quod in Clericum vel Monachum violentas manus injecerit,</HI> &amp;c. help them at all, but that upon offences com|mitted they are puni&s;h'd, as Lay Per&s;ons, by the Secular Judges: And many times they are &s;en&s;ible of the rough and violent hands of wicked Men, without any fear of Excom|munication.
<PB N="306" REF="143">
But as to what concerns the <HI>Law of Order,</HI> or the <HI>Dioce&s;an Law,</HI> tho&s;e things are left to the Clergy. Their Chief Head is call'd <HI>Papas,</HI> or <HI>Metropolitan.</HI> Tho the Title or Sirname of <HI>Abuna,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Our Father,</HI> be more fre|quently given him. He by ancient Cu&s;tom, at the King's de&s;ire, is Con&s;ecrated to that Dignity by the Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and &s;ent out of <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For they do not think it fitting for the Patriarch to nominate any one out of their own Nation, tho never &s;o skilful in their Language, Laws and Cu&s;toms. It being provided by tho&s;e <HI>Nicene</HI> Ca|nons, extant in the Arabic Language, <HI>That the</HI> Ethiopians <HI>&s;hall not Elect or Create a Patriarch, but that their chief Chief Pre|late &s;hall be under the Jurisdiction of Him that re&s;ides at</HI> Alexan|dria. And a little after, <HI>That if the Council be held in</HI> Greece, <HI>and the Prelate of</HI> Ethiopia <HI>be pre&s;ent, he &s;hall have the &s;eventh place, next the Prelate of</HI> Seleucia. For they are very ob&s;tinate in maintaining their old Cu&s;toms, tho it happen to be one of their greate&s;t Misfortunes. The State and Condition of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church, being quite different now from what it was formerly; that is to &s;ay, altogether mi&s;erable and de|plorable. For both the Patriarch and his Clergy, are a poor &s;ort of contemptible and ru&s;tic People, and void of all com|mon Endowments. They are as it were the Servants and Slaves of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who&s;e continual vexations &s;o terrifie them from undertaking Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Employment, that many times they receive their Ordination by con&s;traint, and with Tears in their Eyes; which requires nothing more from them than to read <HI>Arabic.</HI></P>
<P>For the <HI>Coptic,</HI> or ancient <HI>Egyptian</HI> Language, as it was &s;po|ken in the times of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Kings, and as <HI>Athana&s;ius Kir|ker</HI> has given a view of it to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> is now almo&s;t buried in Oblivion. Their Churches are either all de&s;troy'd, or very near to Ruin; the <HI>Turks</HI> not &s;uffering them either to Rebuild or Repair. The Patriarch, if he can but only read and write, and under&s;tand the Scripture after an ordinary manner, is thought &s;ufficiently worthy of St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s <HI>Chair.</HI> Hence it may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd, what &s;ort of Per&s;ons are &s;ent into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> for the Government of &s;o many Churches. In the time of the Fathers of the Society, there was &s;ent &s;uch a &s;ad Tool into <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> to be the <HI>Abuna,</HI> that being re|jected for his Simplicity, he was forc'd to Grind Corn for his living. To whom another Succeeding, not much better

gifted, gave occa&s;ion to the Courtiers to je&s;t, and cry, <HI>We have a Miller &s;till.</HI> Now as the&s;e Patriarchs know very little, &s;o they do as little, only in &s;et forms of Words, they ordain Under-Clercs, ju&s;t as wi&s;e and learned as them&s;elves.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on the Fathers of the Society, little regarded the Ordinations of the <HI>Abuna,</HI> but when any of the <HI>Abe&s;sine</HI> Prie&s;ts came over to them, they ordain'd them again after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, not without the great re&s;entment and indig|nation of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In none of their Kingdoms or Provinces have they any <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> or <HI>Arch-Bi&s;hops.</HI> So that unle&s;s the <HI>Icegue,</HI> with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Monks, had taken &s;ome care of the Church, all thought of Religion had fallen to the ground long e're this.</P>
<P>This <HI>Abuna</HI> is by &s;ome, tho improperly call'd <HI>Patriarch,</HI> his truer Title being that of <HI>Bik Papas,</HI> or <HI>Bik Papa&s;te,</HI> Prince or Ma&s;ter of the Metropolitans; of whom they acknowledge only Four to be of equal Power and Dignity among them|&s;elves. Among the&s;e they reckon the <HI>Roman</HI> Patriarch to be the Fir&s;t, and call him <HI>Bik Papa&s;te Zaromeja,</HI> or the <HI>Roman Pa|triarch.</HI> For they have no higher Title to give to any one who may be thought Superior to a Patriarch.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Metropolitan of <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> was <HI>Frumentius,</HI> the Ethiopic Apo&s;tle. From him to <HI>Simeon,</HI> who dy'd with <HI>Elius</HI> in defence of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, they reck'n in order Ninety five Metropolitans.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church remain'd in Unity with it &s;elf, and with the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, till the <HI>Council of</HI> Chalcedon, by us call'd the <HI>Fourth Univer&s;al Council,</HI> which <HI>Marcian</HI> the Emperor Summon'd, to appea&s;e the Di&s;|cords and Di&s;&s;entions that were ri&s;en among the Bi&s;hops and Divines, by rea&s;on of the Doctrine of <HI>Eutyches.</HI> This <HI>Eutyches,</HI> a Con&s;tantinopolitan Abbot a&s;&s;erted, <HI>That both the Natures of Chri&s;t, the Divine and Human, upon his Incarnation, immediately became one and the &s;ame; and that therefore there was but one Na|ture, and one Will in Chri&s;t.</HI> For which rea&s;on, they that held this Opinion were call'd <HI>Monothelites.</HI> Thereupon it was Decreed in this Council, <HI>That Chri&s;t was of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance with the Father, according to his Deity, but Sin excepted; of the &s;ame Sub&s;tance, and like to us in all things, according to his Hu|manity. One and the &s;ame in two Natures united, yet without mixture, mutation, divi&s;ion or di&s;tance, both Natures acting that which was proper to it, by Communion with each other Dio&s;curus</HI> al&s;o, the Pa|triarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> was condemn'd as a Heretic, &amp; Defender of <HI>Eutyches;</HI> and not only &s;o, but being publickly whipp'd, he was &s;ent into Exile, and another put up in his room, who becau&s;e he follow'd the Emperors or the Royal Religion,
<PB N="311" REF="145">
was therefore call'd a <HI>Melchite,</HI> or Royali&s;ts according to the <HI>Arabic</HI> word. The Contradicters of this Opinion were call'd <HI>Eutychians,</HI> afterwards <HI>Jacobites</HI> from one <HI>Jacob,</HI> a Syrian, who &s;toutly defended the Doctrine of <HI>Eutyches.</HI> Hence aro&s;e a mo&s;t fierce and outragious Schi&s;m in the Church of <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI> defil'd with Blood and Slaughter, which was the rea|&s;on that not only the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Church was rent and torn from the re&s;t of the Catholic Church; but that <HI>Egypt</HI> al&s;o, weaken'd with it's own civil Di&s;&s;entions, became a Prey to the <HI>Saracens,</HI> who taking advantage of the Di&s;cords of the Chri&s;tians among them&s;elves, overcame and &s;ubjugated the upholders of both Opinions: &s;o that now there is little or nothing remaining of Chri&s;tianity in <HI>Egypt.</HI> Thus our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Writers.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> relate, that <HI>Dio&s;corus,</HI> his Succe&s;&s;ors, and their Followers, heavily complain'd of the Injury done them: for that he never follow'd <HI>Eutyches,</HI> nor ever deny'd nor con|fus'd the Divinity and Humanity really exi&s;ting in Chri&s;t; only he would not acknowledge the word <HI>Nature</HI> to be common to the Divinity and Humanity of Chri&s;t: and that he only endeavour'd to prevent the A&s;&s;erting of two Per&s;ons in Chri&s;t, contrary to the Opinion of the Catholic Church, and the Decrees of the Council of <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> believing that ab&s;urdity would follow, &s;hould we admit two Wills and Natures in Chri&s;t. La&s;tly, That the word <HI>Nature,</HI> &s;ig|nifying &s;omething Born or Created, did no way quadrate with Divinity, neither could two Wills in two Natures, united without Divi&s;ion, Separation, or Di&s;tance be con|ceiv'd by the under&s;tanding of Man: That it was not to be thought that Human Nature exalted to a State of Glory, would de&s;ire, act, or &s;uffer, what is &s;uffer'd, acted, or de|&s;ired in the State of Mortality; or that Humanity in a pre|&s;ent State of Glory, &s;hould de&s;ire or be &s;en&s;ible of that which Divinity was not &s;en&s;ible of or de&s;ir'd.

And therefore the&s;e things con&s;ider'd, it was evident that <HI>Dio&s;curus,</HI> was neither &s;ufficiently heard nor rightly under&s;tood, but in his ab&s;ence condemn'd as an ob&s;tinate Heretick, rather out of Hatred and Envy then by

<P>In the fir&s;t place therefore I found it beyond all doubt, that the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> do reject the Council of <HI>Calcedon,</HI> tho they un|der&s;tand not what was done therein, as having never re|ceiv'd or thought worthy of their Tran&s;cription the <HI>Canons</HI> there made.

<P>Fifthly, <HI>Tellez</HI> atte&s;ts from the Relation of the Fathers of the Society, that both Natures are to be found in their Books, and imputes it to their Contumacy, that they will not ac|knowledge in words what they believe concerning the Ca|tholic Truth, when they teach the &s;ame thing in their Wri|tings, <HI>That the Catholic</HI> Habe&s;&s;ines <HI>&s;uffering Per&s;ecution from the Hereticks, cry'd out,</HI> God and Man, <HI>whereby they both a&s;&s;erted the Catholic Faith, and the two Natures in Christ.</HI> But more then this, we have the Te&s;timony of <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> in one of who&s;e Orations to his Soldiers, we find that all the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> con|fe&s;s, <HI>That Chri&s;t is the true God, and true Man;</HI> and con&s;equent|ly, we mu&s;t allow what the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the Society relate, that they acknowledge two Natures in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Sixthly, we are to take notice, That the words which the Greeks u&s;e, and which the Latines have made u&s;e of in the&s;e difficult que&s;tions of Faith, as <HI>E&s;&s;ence, Sub&s;tance</HI> or <HI>Sub&s;i&s;tance, Per&s;on, Nature,</HI> among the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> are interpreted by words Equivocal, from whence it is no wonder there &s;hould be &s;uch a &s;pring of Errors. For <HI>Helave,</HI> &s;ometimes &s;ignifies <HI>E&s;&s;ence,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>Hypo&s;ta&s;is</HI> or <HI>Sub&s;tance. Gregory</HI> al&s;o affirm'd, That there were &s;ome who a&s;&s;ert <HI>Qalet Helwejet,</HI> two E&s;&s;ences, that is the Divinity and Humanity in Chri&s;t, and that each Nature retains its proper E&s;&s;ence. Others for fear of falling into the <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> Error, rather cho&s;e to make u&s;e of the word <HI>Bakreye,</HI> which properly &s;ignifies a <HI>Pearl,</HI> affirming there are in Chri&s;t <HI>Qalit Bah reyat,</HI> two precious Sub&s;tances; in imitation of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who u&s;e their own word, which &s;ignifies a <HI>Pearl,</HI> by which to expre&s;s the Divine <HI>Sub&s;i&s;tance.</HI> Which others again di&s;like, as being a
<PB N="314" REF="147">
word no le&s;s Equivocal, becau&s;e it may be taken either for <HI>Sub&s;i&s;tance</HI> or <HI>Per&s;on;</HI> as when they of the Son, <HI>Zatwalda em|baha reju Baab, who was born of the Sub&s;tance of the Father.</HI> Thus the Author of a certain Manu&s;cript call'd, <HI>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Computation</HI> concludes,
<Q>Who were witne&s;s of one Per&s;on of Christ, <HI>Synodius</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>From whence we gather, that when we from the Council of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> di&s;pute of the <HI>Nature,</HI> they mean the <HI>Per&s;on.</HI> Now adays, when they &s;peak of the <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> they make u&s;e for the mo&s;t part of the word <HI>Agal,</HI> as being le&s;s Equivocal; tho &s;ometime we &s;hall meet with the word <HI>Gaz</HI> to &s;ignifie <HI>Per&s;on,</HI> ill render'd when taken for the <HI>Countenance</HI> or <HI>Face.</HI> Which Circum&s;tances, when I read and con&s;ider, I find all things to be perplex'd and ob&s;cure; no certain State of the Que&s;tion; and the words them&s;elves without limitation Equi|vocal. Perhaps <HI>Eutyches</HI> him&s;elf could not explain what &s;ort of <HI>Nature</HI> was meant, how it was made out of the <HI>two?</HI> How it was call'd? or what the Qualities of it were? But that he was &s;o egregiou&s;ly &s;tupid, as to think the two Natures &s;o mix'd in Chri&s;t, as <HI>Water with Wine,</HI> and that he had &s;o many Wi&s;e and Learned Men to follow him in that Opinion, is almo&s;t incredible. As for the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> they are mo&s;t certainly not guilty of &s;o &s;otti&s;h a Here&s;ie. For which rea&s;on I confe&s;s, I cannot apprehend what the&s;e frequent Di&s;putations were, which the Fathers of the Society had with the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> wherein, they &s;ay, the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> were always forc'd to &s;ub|mit, as being convicted out of their own Books. Which is the more ea&s;ie to believ'd, in regard they &s;o willingly ac|knowledge the Divinity and Humanity of Chri&s;t. But that they &s;hould out of Contumacy and Heretical Pravity con|tradict the Fathers, and choo&s;e to &s;uffer Exilements, and other Puni&s;hments, or run the hazard of Civil Di&s;&s;entions, rather than forego their Opinion, is hardly to be credited. To me it &s;eems therefore more probable, that they could not agree about the words. For if a man &s;hould fir&s;t explain his meaning, and tell them, that by the two Natures in Chri&s;t, we under&s;tand as well his Divinity as his Humanity, and then upon this Explanation ask them, <HI>Which Nature was wanting in Chri&s;t, &s;eeing they acknowledge but one?</HI> Certainly
<PB N="315" REF="147">
they would an&s;wer, <HI>That neither his Divinity nor his Humanity were wanting; but that both continue and endure for ever.</HI> And thus it will appear, that they under&s;tand the word <HI>Nature</HI> far otherwi&s;e than we do, and that the true &s;tate of the Que&s;tion among the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in this, <HI>Whether by any, or by what name both the Ab&s;tract Natures</HI> (which undoubt|edly they admit) <HI>are to be call'd?</HI> Now therefore becau&s;e <HI>Tellez</HI> does not &s;ay in what Language they Di&s;puted (for the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> under&s;tand neither <HI>Latin</HI> nor <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>) how they expre&s;s'd them&s;elves when they mention'd the words <HI>E&s;&s;ence, Per&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Nature,</HI> how they explain'd Equivocal words, or how the Interpreters render'd them, whether they could not agree upon the common <HI>word,</HI> or whether the word <HI>Sub&s;tance</HI> di&s;pleas'd, as fearing that to grant two <HI>Sub&s;tances,</HI> would be to grant two Per&s;ons, I leave to farther enqui|ry. Nor can I find out in &s;o much Variety and Ambiguity of words, what word is mo&s;t proper to be us'd in our &s;en&s;e for the word Nature. For the <HI>Jacobites</HI> when they make u&s;e of the Arabic <HI>Tabia,</HI> or the Ethiopic <HI>Tabaje,</HI> which an&s;wers to the Greek word <HI>Phy&s;is,</HI> and by the <HI>Copts</HI> is call'd <HI>D Phy&s;is,</HI> apply it only to things created, more e&s;pecially to the Elements, but never to the <HI>Godhead:</HI> which the <HI>Melkites</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> being de&s;titute of any other, make no &s;cruple to do. Hence the Contention. For thus &s;aith <HI>Eutychius,</HI> Patriarch of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> a <HI>Melkite;</HI> In Chri&s;t there are,
<Q>Two Sub&s;tances, a Sub&s;tance of Divinity, and a Sub&s;tance of Humanity; but one Per&s;on. To every Sub&s;tance there belongs a Nature; and &s;o two Sub&s;tances, two Natures, but one Per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>For this rea&s;on, in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where this unhappy difference &s;till remains, when the <HI>Copts</HI> cry out in Arabic <HI>Ma&s;hiah Wahid, Tabiah Wahid, One Will, one Nature;</HI> the Melkites an&s;wer, <HI>Ma&s;hiatan tabiahtan, Two Wills, two Natures.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1634. an <HI>European</HI> of great Quality re&s;iding in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and having vievv'd and read the Books of the <HI>Copts,</HI> deliver'd his Opinion aftervvards, <HI>That the difference and quarrel of the Parties proceeded more from a fear of the Con|&s;equence, than from the Thing it &s;elf. For the</HI> Greeks <HI>are for the Destruction of tho&s;e Hereticks that confu&s;e and mix the Divinity

<P>Which if it be &s;o, that the Contention and Debate, either formerly, or now, is only about the &s;ence of words, What Tears and Lamentations can &s;uffice to bewail the &s;ad Effects of &s;uch an Unfortunate Pedantic Brabble? What brea&s;t that lodges a heart &s;o hard, that can refrain from bemoaning the &s;ad and calamitous Contentions of tho&s;e, to whom Chri&s;t has &s;o earne&s;tly recommended the mo&s;t &s;trict Bonds of Charity by his own Example? Humanity one would think, &s;hould not be &s;o inhuman, for the &s;ake of one word <HI>Nature</HI> mi&s;under&s;tood, to tear up the foundations of Concord between tho&s;e, who&s;e Nature the Eternal Word has a&s;&s;um'd into his mo&s;t Holy Sub&s;i&s;tence. But as it is the Infirmity of our mo&s;t corrupted Nature, where Ambition, from Ambition Emulation, from Emulation Envy, from Envy Hatred have taken root, that the Mind po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with various Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections, &s;eeks no farther after Truth, hence it is that Men with Ears ob&s;tructed, and blinded Eyes, pur&s;ue di&s;putes to &s;a|tisfie their private Ends; not con&s;idering the true end of Arguing and Di&s;pute.</P>

<P>The Patriarch of the <HI>Melkites</HI> and <HI>Jacobites,</HI> which the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> follow|ing, di&s;united them&s;elves from the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> They had Knowledge of the Pope. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third writes to the King of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> An Emba&s;&s;ie to <HI>Eugenius</HI> the Fourth, and <HI>Clement</HI> the 7th. <HI>John Bermudes</HI> confirm'd by <HI>Paul</HI> the Third. Whence Hopes of &s;ub|jecting the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> to the See of <HI>Rome. Barret</HI> and <HI>Oviedo</HI> made Patriarchs. They &s;end before to &s;ound the King.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Horrid flames of Di&s;cord being thus broken forth, all tho&s;e Nations that were Subject to the Alexandrian <HI>See,</HI> &s;eparated them&s;elves into Parties almo&s;t equal in Strength. And every Faction cho&s;e its par|ticular Faction. The <HI>Grecian</HI> Chri&s;tians, who were in Sub|jection to the <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan</HI> Emperor, adher'd to the Pa|triarch of the <HI>Melkites;</HI> The re&s;t who inhabited the inner|mo&s;t Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and among them the <HI>Axumites,</HI> follow'd the Patriarch of the <HI>Jacobites;</HI> and thus being rent not only from the <HI>Greek,</HI> but <HI>Roman</HI> Church, they had little or no knowledge of either. After this, the Power of the <HI>Saracens</HI> increa&s;ing, and all <HI>Egypt</HI> being by them &s;ubdu'd, all Corre|&s;pondence and Communication of Arts and Knowledge ceas'd between <HI>Them,</HI> and the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of our part of the World. Neverthele&s;s &s;ome glimp&s;es they had of the <HI>Roman Pontiffs,</HI> from the Acts of the Ancient Councils, and reve|renc'd them as Chief among the Oecunomical Patriarchs. On the other &s;ide the Pope laying hold of the occa&s;ion, en|deavour'd to Re-e&s;tabli&s;h the former Corre&s;pondence and Amity, not taking any notice of their being <HI>Monothelites,</HI>

or Favourers of the condemn'd <HI>Dio&s;curus.</HI> To this purpo&s;e <HI>Baronius</HI> has &s;et forth an Epi&s;tle taken out of <HI>Roger</HI>'s <HI>Engli&s;h Annals,</HI> written by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third, with this Super|&s;cription. <HI>To our mo&s;t dear Son in Chri&s;t, the Illu&s;trious and Mag|nificent King of the</HI> Indians, <HI>the most Holy of Priests.</HI> Which Epi&s;tle he erroneou&s;ly believes to have bin written to <HI>Prester John,</HI> who&s;e Dominions were then very large in <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> For that when <HI>Baronius</HI> wrote, the King of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> was reputed and commonly taken for <HI>Prester John.</HI> But when <HI>Alexander</HI> the Third liv'd, the real <HI>Pre&s;ter John</HI> was then reigning in <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Neither is any thing to be gather'd out of that whole Epi&s;tle, that has any Relation to <HI>Africa,</HI> or <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> or the King of the <HI>Habe&s;sines;</HI> nor are the Con&s;equences of that Letter known to <HI>Baronius.</HI> Only upon that occa&s;ion, he conjectures that the Church of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> with the Buildings behind St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Cathedral, were there|upon a&s;&s;ign'd to the <HI>Habe&s;sinians;</HI> though he is not certain by whom that A&s;&s;ignation was made, whether by <HI>Alexander</HI> or any other Succeeding Pope. Therefore, if the Epi&s;tle were real, we rather think it was written to the A&s;iatic <HI>Pre&s;ter John,</HI> then to the King of the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI> Others there are, that believe there was an <HI>Abe&s;sinian</HI> Emba&s;&s;y to <HI>Clement</HI> the Fifth, re&s;iding at <HI>Avignon.</HI> Nor is there any doubt made of the Emba&s;&s;y which <HI>Zera-Jacob</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Eugenius</HI> the Fourth, in the year 1439. toward the Conclu&s;ion of the Council of <HI>Florence. Gregory</HI> had known nothing of it, had he not &s;een the Emba&s;|&s;ador and his Retinue painted at <HI>Rome,</HI> and known his own Countrymen by their Habit.</P>
<P>In the former Century, <HI>Francis Alvarez,</HI> Prie&s;t to the <HI>Por|tugal</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ent into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> brought Letters from <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Clement</HI> the Seventh, which he delivered to the Pope in a public A&s;&s;embly of the Cardinals, <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth being there al&s;o pre&s;ent, promi&s;ing Reverence and Obedience withal to the Holy See, in the Name of the King of <HI>Ethio|pia.</HI> It was a thing very grateful to the Pope, that at a time when &s;o many Northern Nations had revolted from the <HI>Ro|man</HI> See, &s;o many Kingdoms of the Ea&s;t and South, &s;hould voluntarily &s;ubmit to his Juri&s;diction. For which rea&s;on, neither <HI>Alvarez</HI>'s Credentials, nor the words of the Epi&s;tle were over-nicely examin'd, nor any extraordinary Scrutiny made to what Church, or what &s;ort of Religion the King him|&s;elf was enclin'd, to the end that had it been needful, he might
<PB N="319" REF="150">
have bin ab&s;olv'd from the guilt of Here&s;ie, before his Ad|mi&s;&s;ion into the Bo&s;om of the Church. For as we &s;hall afterwards declare, the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> made quite another In|terpretation of their King's Intention. In the mean time a certain form of Friend&s;hip long remain'd. For when <HI>John Bermudes</HI> came to <HI>Rome</HI> to crave A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Europeans</HI> in the behalf of <HI>David,</HI> &s;o often vanqui&s;h'd by the <HI>Adelans; Paul</HI> the Third, hearing that the &s;aid <HI>Bermudes</HI> was by <HI>Mark</HI> the Metropolitan, nominated his Succe&s;&s;or, and inve&s;ted with Holy Orders, made no &s;cruple to confirm him, and to ratifie the Ordination of a Schi&s;matical Prelate. There were then re&s;iding certain <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> very good Men, who Printed the New Te&s;tament with their Liturgies in the E|thiopic Language, whom the Pope did not only tolerate, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted at his own Expences. In recompence of which Kindne&s;&s;es, they extoll'd and applauded the Benevolence of the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Munificence of the Chief Pontiff, and his Spiritual Daughter <HI>Hyeronyma Farne&s;ia,</HI> and acknowledg'd the Pope as the Head and Supream over all the Orthodox Chri&s;tians. <HI>Pius</HI> the Fifth al&s;o in his Letters to <HI>Menas,</HI> tho a profe&s;&s;ed Enemy to the <HI>Romans,</HI> call'd him his <HI>mo&s;t dear Son;</HI> whether he were ignorant of his hatred to the <HI>Latins,</HI> which was a wonder; or whether he had hopes to reclaim him by flattering Titles, which <HI>Godignus</HI> rather conjectures to be the Pope's true Intention. For this rea&s;on, &s;ome there were who believ'd the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> to be Catholicks in the highe&s;t perfe|ction, and &s;ubject to the See of <HI>Rome;</HI> tho <HI>Tellez</HI> de&s;ervedly taxes and derides their Credulity. Neverthele&s;s a vain hope had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Minds of many of the more Zealous &s;ort, that that va&s;t Kingdom, then look'd upon to be four times as big as really it was, might in a &s;hort time, with little diffi|culty, be annexed to the Pontifical Juri&s;diction. Among the re&s;t, the Founder of the Society of <HI>Je&s;us, Ignatius Loyola,</HI> bent all his Study to bring it to pa&s;s, and to that end he &s;hew'd a mo&s;t Ardent de&s;ire to go him&s;elf, and win the honour of Converting <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> Which tho <HI>Julius</HI> the Third would not grant him the liberty to do, neverthele&s;s he &s;o far pre|vail'd with him, that by the connivance of <HI>John</HI> the Third King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> the Patriarchal Dignity was conferr'd up|on <HI>John Nonius Barret,</HI> one of his Companions, contrary to the In&s;titutions of his Society, tho <HI>Bermudes</HI> were then in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> already dignify'd with the &s;ame Title. With him

was joyn'd <HI>Andrew Oviedo,</HI> a Bi&s;hop, that if <HI>Barret</HI> through Mortality &s;hould mi&s;carry, he might not want an immedi|ate Succe&s;&s;or. They, Embarking in &s;everal Ships, &s;ayl'd into <HI>India.</HI> In the mean time <HI>Claudius</HI> was become Succe&s;&s;or to <HI>Da|vid</HI> his Father, who&s;e affection they thought it fir&s;t expedient to &s;ound, before the Patriarch &s;hould expo&s;e him&s;elf to Ca&s;u|alties and Indignities. <HI>Jacobus Dias</HI> was therefore &s;ent be|fore, together with <HI>Gon&s;ales Rodriguez,</HI> and <HI>Fulgentio Freyre,</HI> Je&s;uits; who toward the beginning of <HI>February</HI> &s;etting Sail from <HI>Go&acirc;,</HI> and a Month after arriving at the Port of <HI>Arkiko,</HI> were there curteou&s;ly receiv'd by the Pre&s;ident of the Ma|ritime Province, and within the &s;pace of two Months brought to the King. Who under&s;tanding that the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> was about to &s;end Prie&s;ts, and other Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons to teach him and his People a new Religion, was very much perplex'd in his Mind, and long in Su&s;pence what an&s;wer to return; for he neither thought it convenient to admit them, neither was he willing to offend the King of <HI>Portugal.</HI> However he ventur'd upon &s;everal Colloquies with the Envoys, the &s;um of which, manag'd for the mo&s;t part by <HI>Gon&s;alez,</HI> tended to this, <HI>That the Pope of</HI> Rome <HI>was Chri&s;t's Vicar upon Earth, and the Supream Head of all Chri&s;tia|nity, and therefore if the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ines <HI>were de&s;irous of Eternal Hap|pine&s;s, they &s;hould once more return and joyn them&s;elves to their Law|ful Head; for that Chri&s;t him&s;elf had from his own lips a&s;&s;erted, that his Church was but one Fold, and over that but one Shepheard,</HI> &amp;c. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> made an&s;wer, <HI>That an Af|fair of &s;o great Con&s;equence was to be con&s;ider'd and con&s;ulted upon with the other Patriarchs; for to abandon their ancient Rites and Ceremonies upon private admonition, and receive new ones, was a thing full of danger and offence.</HI> At length the King told them, <HI>That if tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>&s;hould &s;end, would take the pains to come to</HI> Matzua, <HI>he would order &s;ome Per|&s;on to be there, both to give them a befitting Reception, and Con|duct them to his Court.</HI> Be&s;ides all this, the King was no le&s;s fearful, lea&s;t the <HI>Portugals,</HI> as it had befallen &s;everal other Kings in <HI>India,</HI> &s;hould make him their Tributary, and un|der the pretence of Religion, powre into his Country a great force of Soldiers, Arm'd and furni&s;h'd with Fire-Arms; E&s;pecially remembring what great Exploits a &s;mall Num|ber of <HI>Portugals</HI> had perform'd in his Kingdom but a few years before.

that height, that when King <HI>David</HI> had &s;eriou&s;ly negotiated with <HI>Roderigo Limez,</HI> the <HI>Portugal</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, about the Re|covery and Fortification of <HI>Matzua,</HI> and <HI>Suaqena,</HI> and had al&s;o offer'd a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Forces, Provi&s;ion and Money, afterwards the Bu&s;ine&s;s was not only no farther mention'd, but al&s;o the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Aid, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;o much de&s;ir'd was ut|terly refus'd; &s;o that he cho&s;e rather to leave the Port of <HI>Arkiko,</HI> with the I&s;land adjoyning, in the hands of the <HI>Turk,</HI> then to give Admi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Portugals. So prevalent is the fear of Foreign Domination.</HI></P>
<P>But now <HI>Claudius</HI>'s an&s;wer being return'd into <HI>India,</HI> &s;trange|ly &s;urpriz'd the Patriarch <HI>Barret,</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, who imagin'd that all things would have bin &s;mooth and ea&s;ie according to their wi&s;hes. Thereupon after long delibera|tion, they came to this re&s;ult, <HI>Le&s;t the Patriarchal Dignity &s;hould be hazarded with a Prince ill affected, which would be to the Detri|ment of the Pontifical Authority, and a contempt of the King of</HI> Por|tugal, <HI>by who&s;e recommendation and favour they were &s;ent, that the Patriarch &s;hould remain in</HI> India <HI>with</HI> Melchior Caymero <HI>Bi&s;hop of</HI> Nice, <HI>and that</HI> Oviedo <HI>&s;hould go alone, to the end he might take his mea&s;ures by the Event of</HI> Oviedo<HI>'s Succe&s;s.

The Common People ignorant of their Errand, nor altogether aver&s;e to the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Ceremo|nies, receiv'd the Bi&s;hop and his A&s;&s;ociates with great te&s;ti|monies of Kindne&s;s, even to the ki&s;&s;ing their hands. The Romani&s;ts laying hold upon the occa&s;ion, re&s;olv'd upon a <HI>Proce&s;sion</HI> from their own to the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Church, and were by them beheld with mutual Charity, without the lea&s;t up|brading or reproach of the Novelty. The King al&s;o en|tertain'd them with great kindne&s;s; only he took it ill that they &s;hould talk to him of yielding obedience to the <HI>Roman Pontiff.</HI> Neverthele&s;s as he was a mo&s;t Prudent Per&s;on, and worthy the high Dignity he enjoy'd, he always carry'd him|&s;elf with &s;o great Moderation toward the Bi&s;hop, that he &s;till left him with &s;ome hopes of Succe&s;s. In the mean time the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion was every where freely exercis'd, and no man forbid who defir'd to embrace it. But the Bi&s;hop not content with &s;o much favour, began to pre&s;s the King more urgently, <HI>That at length without more delay, he would &s;ub|mit him&s;elf to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff.</HI> He reply'd, <HI>That his An|ce&s;tors
<PB N="322" REF="152">
had in &s;acred things given their Obedience to none but the Succe&s;&s;ors of St.</HI> Mark; <HI>nor did he &s;ee any cau&s;e why he &s;hould de&s;ire Innovation, and di&s;turb his People well contented with their</HI> Abuna? But the Bi&s;hop &s;till continuing his Importunity, The King told him, <HI>That &s;ince he was come to him from a Region &s;o far di|&s;tant upon &s;o hone&s;t a Negotiation, he would con&s;ult with his Friends and his Learned Men upon a Matter of &s;o great Importance. Oviedo</HI> under&s;tanding that the King did nothing but &s;pin out delays; and hearing withal, that the King's Mother, and all the Blood Royal, together with the Nobility and greate&s;t Do|ctors of the Nation were utterly aver&s;e to any Alterations, wrote an Epi&s;tle to the King, wherein he put him in Mind, <HI>That his Father had acknowledg'd the Pope of</HI> Rome <HI>for the Vicar of Christ; that &s;everal of his Learned men had be&s;ought him; that</HI> Claudius <HI>had wrote to the King of</HI> Portugal; <HI>and that his Father had Commanded, that they &s;hould not de&s;ire an</HI> Abuna <HI>from any other place then from</HI> Rome: <HI>and that He him&s;elf had publickly promis'd Obedience to thee See of</HI> Rome. <HI>That if any doubt remain'd con|cerning any Articles of Faith, he &s;hould bring tho&s;e things to a Pub|lick Di&s;pute, and hear the Arguments on both &s;ides: it being but ju&s;t, that the Party that was foil'd, &s;hould acknowledge and fol|low what the other had maintain'd for Truth: and that the King &s;hould well con&s;ider who&s;e advice he took, or what Per&s;ons he con&s;ulted in &s;o important an Affair. That the Ends and Intere&s;t of Parents or Kindred were not to be regarded: That the love of Christ was to be preferr'd before the love of Relations, who be|ing bu&s;ied in Teaching his own Doctrine in the Temple of</HI> Jeru|&s;alem, <HI>would not make u&s;e of his mo&s;t Holy Mothers advice; by which he &s;hew'd, that in the Cau&s;e of God no Man is bound to Communicate his Intentions to his nearest Friends.</HI> Whether the King made any An&s;wer, or what it was, is not known. But <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, That the &s;ence of the King's Com|mands and Letters, was quite different from the Expo&s;i|tions of <HI>Alvarez, Bermudes</HI> and others addicted to the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Religion made of them at <HI>Rome:</HI> and that it could not be otherwi&s;e, in regard that before the Reign of <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> the <HI>Habes&s;ines</HI> had never known what that Obedience meant. Hower the King, that he might not &s;eem to di&s;tru&s;t the &s;trength of his own Cau&s;e, and the learning of his own Sub|jects, permitted frequent Di&s;putes, not yet made Publick by the Fathers of the Society. From this <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, <HI>That the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ine <HI>Doctors appear'd very ignorant and illiterate in all

And there|fore, to te&s;tifie his Indignation, he left the Court, and pub|li&s;h'd a Writing, <HI>Where in he branded the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ines <HI>with &s;everal Here&s;ies, and exhorted his</HI> Portugue&s;es <HI>to have a care of them.</HI> Which did not a little offend <HI>Claudius.</HI> For a mind free, and &s;ubject to none, when once it refu&s;es the per&s;ua&s;ion of Ar|gument, is the more exa&s;perated by affront and reviling.

<P>Not long after <HI>Claudius</HI> was &s;lain in a Battel again&s;t the <HI>Adelans;</HI> to whom, in regard he dy'd without I&s;&s;ue, his Bro|ther <HI>Adamas-Saghed</HI> Succeeded, a Per&s;on quite of another di&s;po&s;ition, as one that retain'd nothing of his Moderation or Clemency. For whatever Indulgencies <HI>Claudius</HI> had granted to <HI>Oviedo,</HI> and the Embracers of his Doctrine, he re|call'd them all; nor would he &s;o much as permit that the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Women, who were Marry'd to the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> &s;hould exerci&s;e the Religion of their Husbands; to which he added many other &s;evere Edicts, declaring openly, <HI>That his Brother was therefore puni&s;h'd by God, becau&s;e he did not per|&s;ecute the Religion of the</HI> Franks; as it is frequent to attribute Adver&s;ity or Pro&s;perity to neglected or protected Religion. Nay, he proceeded &s;o far, that having &s;ent for <HI>Oviedo,</HI> he threaten'd him with Death, if he continu'd divulging and &s;owing <HI>Roman</HI> Paradoxes in his Dominions. Which when the Bi&s;hop refus'd to con&s;ent to, &s;aying, <HI>That God was to be

obey'd, rather then Man,</HI> he drew his Scymiter in a rage, and unle&s;s the Queen, and &s;ome of the chief Nobility had pre|vented him, had undoubtedly di&s;patch'd the Bi&s;hop to the other World. The Bi&s;hop therefore, in this de&s;perate Con|dition of Affairs retires to <HI>Fremona,</HI> where he lay conceal'd, thirty whole years together, and a&s;&s;uming to him&s;elf, after the Death of <HI>Barret,</HI> the Title of Patriarch, officiated among his own <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> without any further mole&s;tation: in re|gard that <HI>Melec-Saghed</HI> after his Father's violent Death, &s;hew'd him&s;elf more mild, and temperate to the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> who behaving them&s;elves more mode&s;tly, gave him no cau&s;e of Provocation. But at length all the Avenues into <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> being &s;hut-up by the <HI>Turk,</HI> and the Fathers that were &s;ent thither being all taken and &s;lain, the State of Religion among the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> was reduc'd to that extremity, that all the Fa|thers being deceas'd, there was none remain'd alive to offi|ciate Divine Service.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Goa,</HI> and the Fathers of the So|ciety were not ignorant of the afflicted Condition of the <HI>Roman</HI> Wor&s;hip in <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI> And there|fore, whereas before they had conceiv'd va&s;t hope of Total Conver&s;ion of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> now the ca&s;e was &s;o far alter'd, that they found them&s;elves put to a Nece&s;&s;ity of providing for their own few Countrymen, lea&s;t they &s;hould be utterly de|&s;titute of Provi&s;ion for the Salvation of their own Souls, as not having any Prie&s;ts to perform Religious Duties among them. Mov'd therefore by the In&s;tigation of Con&s;cience, they took it into &s;erious Con&s;ideration, lea&s;t while they were bu&s;yed about Subjecting <HI>Aba&s;sia</HI> to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> that nothing belong'd to it, they &s;hould loo&s;e their own Countrymen, Profe&s;&s;ors of their own Religion, who had rea&s;on enough to for&s;ake tho&s;e that for&s;ook them. And therefore they made it their whole &s;tudy how to &s;upply them with Prie&s;ts, to govern their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs. And indeed many had attempted the Journey, but in vain.
<PB N="326" REF="154">
Till at length with the dawn of the new Century, new hopes began to &s;hine forth. For <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> after his fir&s;t unfortunate Attempt, which had expos'd him to various Hazards, and a Captivity in <HI>Arabia,</HI> undertook a &s;econd Journey into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> wherein he pro&s;perou&s;ly Succeeded; being well skill'd both in the Countries, Cu&s;toms and Fo|reign Languages, and able to endure the temperature of tho&s;e Climates. <HI>John Gabriel</HI> a famous <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Collonel, had given King <HI>Jacob</HI> then reigning, notice of his coming, and had &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the young Prince with the worth of the Per|&s;on, by the high Commendations which he gave him, that &s;o &s;oon as the Winter was over, the King &s;ent for him. But he being &s;oon after depos'd, <HI>Zadenghel</HI> was advanc'd in his Room. Thereupon <HI>Peter Pays</HI> kept him&s;elf &s;till at <HI>Fremona;</HI> where, not believing his time could be better &s;pent than in in&s;tructing the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Children, he cho&s;e out &s;ome of the riper Ingenuities, and in a &s;hort time &s;o manur'd them, that they were able to an&s;wer to any Que&s;tion propounded to them concerning the Chri&s;tian Faith. A thing both un|wonted and wonderful to the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> to hear from Chil|dren what they could hardly expect from Per&s;ons of years and Experience. But con&s;idering the Per&s;on, he was not &s;o much wonderful neither; for he was a Man of a quick and ready Wit, that could fit him&s;elf to all Humours, of an affable and complai&s;ant Temper, and well skill'd not only in the Liberal Sciences, but Mechanic Arts. The fame of &s;o acute and laborious a Per&s;on, and &s;o happy in his In&s;truction, being &s;pread over the Neighbouring Regions, in a &s;hort time reach'd the young King's Ears; who being covetous to &s;ee &s;uch a Ma&s;ter and &s;uch Scholars, by his Letters invited him to Court. Thereupon in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1604. accom|pany'd with two <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Youths arriving at Court, he was honourably receiv'd by the King, as if he had bin one of the Nobles of his Kingdom, not without great di&s;ta&s;t taken by the Monks, who&s;e Sloth compar'd to <HI>Peter</HI>'s Diligence and Indu&s;try, render'd them contemptible to mo&s;t. The next day &s;everal Di&s;putes began about Controver&s;ies in Religion, which the King was pleas'd both favourably and patiently to hear; Ma&s;s was al&s;o &s;aid after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, and a Sermon Preach'd; with which <HI>Zadenghel</HI> was &s;o taken, that having Communicated his Intentions to &s;ome of his inti|mate Friends, he re&s;olv'd to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the Pope.
<PB N="327" REF="154">
But in regard he dur&s;t not adventure to do it publickly, he fir&s;t conjur'd <HI>Peter</HI> not to reveal the Secret, and then told him, <HI>That he was Convinc'd by his Arguments, that there was no other Univer&s;al Pa&s;tor and Vicar of Chri&s;t upon Earth be&s;ide the Pope of</HI> Rome. <HI>That to deny it to him, was to deny it to Chri&s;t; that who|ever did not follow his Example, was not of the true Church; and that therefore he had Decreed to reque&s;t a Patriarch and Fathers from</HI> Rome <HI>to in&s;truct his People.</HI></P>
<P>Altho &s;o &s;udden and &s;o unexpected a Declaration of a King could not choo&s;e but infu&s;e a joy un&s;peakable into the heart of <HI>Peter,</HI> yet he contain'd him&s;elf; only what his duty bound him to, he could not but highly extol the Pious Inten|tions of the King. Nor did the King delay: The Secret with which he had tru&s;ted <HI>Peter</HI> under Oath, he him&s;elf made Publick, and pre&s;ently &s;et forth an Edict, <HI>That no Per&s;on &s;hould any longer ob&s;erve the Sabbath as a Holy day.</HI> And indeed he was &s;o forward, that <HI>Peter</HI> was fain to check his Celerity, and put a &s;top to his Career. However Letters were writ|ten to <HI>Clement</HI> the VIII. and <HI>Philip</HI> the Third, King of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and deliver'd to <HI>Peter</HI>'s care, for their &s;afe and honourable conveyance. In the&s;e Letters <HI>he offer'd his Friend|&s;hip, his Soldiers, and his Workmen; and withal requested &s;ome of the Fathers of the Society of Je&s;us to in&s;truct his Subjects.</HI> The&s;e things were not &s;o privately carry'd, but that they were di&s;|cover'd by &s;ome of the chief Nobility of the Kingdom, who were no way &s;atisfy'd at the&s;e underminings of their ancient Religion: wherefore they con&s;pir'd again&s;t their Prince, and flew him in Battel. <HI>Zadenghel</HI> being &s;lain, all <HI>Peter</HI>'s great Hopes vani&s;h'd of a &s;udden, not only through <HI>Za|denghel</HI>'s fall, but by rea&s;on of the Civil Wars that en&s;u'd be|tween <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> contending for the Royal Diadem. And &s;o all Promotion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion &s;urceas'd, till <HI>Jacob</HI> being vanqui&s;h'd and kill'd in the Field, <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> became Lord of <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI> Who again kindly receiv'd and entertain'd <HI>Peter</HI> together with his Companions, and to all his Reque&s;ts lent a mo&s;t gracious Ear.</P>
<P>The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs of <HI>Habe&s;sinia,</HI> were then but in a Low Condition, there not having bin any Peace in the Country for about Four&s;core years: &s;o that perpetual Wars had almo&s;t extingui&s;h'd the Studies of peaceful Arts; nor were there enough to perform Religious Duties in their Chur|ches, but le&s;s to obviate the Encroachment of in&s;inuating
<PB N="328" REF="155">
Errors and Abu&s;es in Religion. The Metropolitans, Per|&s;ons for the mo&s;t part the mo&s;t ignorant that could be ima|gin'd, took no more Cognizance of the Churches which they were appointed to govern, then if they had bin under Foreign Juri&s;diction, only they took up their time in the Or|dination of all &s;orts without any due Examination. There|fore the King and his Nobility ob&s;erving the Diligence of the <HI>Fathers</HI> in in&s;tructing the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Youth; their Zeal in the Conver&s;ion of the People; their Eloquence in Preaching un|heard of before, their Sanctity of living, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary among <HI>Neophytes</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;elytes,</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with &s;o much Admi|ration and Affection toward them, that they could promi&s;e to them&s;elves no other way for re&s;toring their decay'd Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Wor&s;hip, but by their means. Therefore Letters were &s;ent to the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> to reque&s;t their Friend&s;hip, and the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Portugue&s;es. Peter Pays</HI> enlarg'd upon the &s;ame Subject, and added much more con|cerning the King's Affection to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion. Fre|quent Di&s;putations al&s;o were appointed, of which the chief Theme was concerning the <HI>two Natures in Christ,</HI> which, be|ing ea&s;ily demon&s;trable out of the Writings of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> them&s;elves, gave the <HI>Fathers</HI> great Advantage over the <HI>Ethio|pian</HI> Doctors.</P>
<P>The Chiefe&s;t of all the Nobility, <HI>Ras-Seelaxus</HI> the King's Brother by the Mother's &s;ide, publickly profe&s;&s;ed the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and receiv'd the Euchari&s;t openly, according to the <HI>Roman</HI> Manner, who&s;e example many of the Great Com|manders in the Army, both Collonels and Captains follow'd; e&s;pecially &s;eeing the King's favour &s;o con&s;tant toward the <HI>Fa|thers</HI> of the <HI>Society.</HI> At length the King him&s;elf, having re|ceiv'd the An&s;wer of <HI>Paul</HI> the V. in a Letter dated the 31 of <HI>January,</HI> 1623. <HI>Promis'd to yield him Obedience as Univer&s;al Pa&s;tor of the Church, and that he would admit a Patriarch &s;ent from</HI> Rome, <HI>&s;o that nece&s;&s;ary Succors were &s;ent him withal, without which, it was impo&s;sible to accompli&s;h a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much Difficulty and Impor|tance.</HI> He al&s;o &s;ignified his Intentions to &s;end an Emba&s;&s;ador with Father <HI>Antonio Fernandez,</HI> after another manner, and in another Equipage, then had yet bin u&s;ual. To &s;ay truth, the King publickly favour'd the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, without any oppo&s;ition; in regard that the Sword had cut off the greate&s;t part of the &s;tiffe&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;tinate Defenders of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Wor&s;hip. Only the <HI>Monks</HI> remain'd behind,
<PB N="329" REF="155">
who were baffled &s;till in all their Attempts of Di&s;pute. Therefore the King, to the end he might make it mani|fe&s;t to his whole Kingdom, that he had not ra&s;hly, but upon Mature Deliberation, and as it were overcome by the force of Truth, given way to a new Religion, appointed a So|lemn Di&s;pute, where he enjoyn'd mo&s;t of the Nobility of his Kingdom to be pre&s;ent. The Subject of the Di&s;putation was again the repeated Que&s;tion concerning the two Na|tures in Chri&s;t; as if that had bin the utmo&s;t limit of all their Controver&s;ies. And no que&s;tion it might be true what <HI>Tellez</HI> has written, that the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> were vanqui&s;h'd upon the fir&s;t on&s;et. For the reality of the thing &s;upported by &s;o many Authorities and Rea&s;ons afforded an ea&s;ie Victory. Neverthele&s;s there was another Di&s;pute appointed &s;ome few days after, which prov'd no le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful than the for|mer. Wherefore the King, as if the War had now bin at an end, and that now Truth had merited her Triumph, put forth an Edict, that all Per&s;ons for the future &s;hould believe and hold, <HI>That there were two Natures in Chri&s;t, between them|&s;elves really di&s;tinct, but united in one Divine Per&s;on.</HI> This Edict was little regarded by one particular <HI>Monk,</HI> more wilful and &s;tubborn than truly zealous, who being for his Contumacy brought before the King, and &s;peaking in his pre&s;ence more irreverently than became him, was &s;everely Scourg'd for his &s;awcine&s;s. Of the Pain and Angui&s;h of which Cha&s;ti&s;ement, tho the Monk was only &s;en&s;ible, yet the fear of it kept others in awe, who not under&s;tanding that he was puni&s;h'd for his malapertne&s;s, thought he had bin &s;o &s;everely dealt with for denying the <HI>two Natures.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e things being &s;pread abroad, <HI>Simeon</HI> the Metropoli|tan, at that time ab&s;ent, ha&s;tens to the King with his Com|plaints, <HI>That unu&s;ual things had bin done without his knowledge, and that Di&s;putes about Religion had bin appointed in his ab&s;ence.</HI> The King well under&s;tanding how unable he was to grapple with the Fathers in Di&s;pute, made him an&s;wer, <HI>That &s;ince he was come, he would appoint the &s;ame Di&s;putations to be heard over again.</HI> To which <HI>Simeon</HI> had not a word to &s;ay. And thus a &s;econd Victory being won from the Primate of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> him|&s;elf, a more &s;evere Edict concerning the <HI>two Natures</HI> was publi&s;h'd by the <HI>Cryer,</HI> making it Death for any Per&s;on to deny the contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="156">By this &s;o &s;harp a Decree, as if it had bin the loud &s;ignal to Battel, it is incredible to think how the minds of the Peo|ple were incens'd.

But let the Que&s;tion be what it would, &s;uch a &s;evere way of proceeding was never heard of before in</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>as being altogether contradictory to the mildne&s;s of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and the Lenity of the Primitive times. So then if Men were to be &s;courg'd and whipp'd, becau&s;e they could not apprehend two Natures in Chri&s;t, what mu&s;t they expect if other Que&s;tions &s;hould be &s;tarted about Innovations of greater difficulty in the Doctrine and Ceremonies of the Fathers?</HI></P>
<P>Exa&s;perated with the&s;e fair pretences, <HI>Simeon</HI> the Metro|politan, together with &s;everal of the Nobility; and among the re&s;t <HI>Jamanaxus,</HI> alias <HI>Emana Chri&s;tos,</HI> another of the King's Brothers by the Mothers &s;ide; and la&s;tly, almo&s;t all the In|tere&s;ted Clergy and Monks met, and held Con&s;ultations together to prevent the threatning Mi&s;chiefs; and la&s;tly, combin'd <HI>to live and dye for the Defence of their ancient and &s;ettled Religion.</HI> To this end <HI>Simeon,</HI> under pretence of incumbent Duty, which was to be watchful over the Pre&s;ervation of the <HI>Constantinopolitan</HI> Religion, fix'd an <HI>Excommunication</HI> Pub|lickly upon the Dores of the great Church belonging to the Camp, again&s;t all that embrac'd the Religion of the <HI>Franks,</HI> or ventur'd to Di&s;pute concerning it. The King, tho high|ly offended with this unexpected boldne&s;s of the Metropoli|tan, dur&s;t not adventure to revenge him&s;elf; However he Publi&s;h'd another Edict, <HI>whereby Liberty was granted to every Per&s;on that &s;o pleas'd, to embrace and exerci&s;e the Fathers Reli|gion already e&s;tabli&s;h'd by fair Di&s;putes and Arguments on their &s;ide.</HI> Which &s;o little terrify'd the undaunted Metropolitan, that he thunder'd out his Anathema's again&s;t all that main|tain'd <HI>two Natures in Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The Moderate Party bewail'd the&s;e Paper Skirmi&s;hes, which they fore&s;aw would break forth, <HI>and end in Slaughter and Mi&s;ery, and that the King's Decrees would never be e&s;tabli&s;h'd without the effu&s;ion of much Blood.</HI> Sen&s;ible of the&s;e Fears, &s;e|veral of the great Per&s;onages of the Kingdom, together with the King's Mother, <HI>Ite-Hamelmala,</HI> mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;ought the King, to de&s;i&s;t from what he had begun, and not to rai&s;e
<PB N="331" REF="156">
up implacable Seditions to the Ruin of him&s;elf and his King|dom. After which the Metropolitan, with many Monks and Nuns came to the Camp, and implor'd the King, not to innovate any thing in Religion, otherwi&s;e that they were prepar'd to lay down their lives for the Religion of their Ance&s;tors. At la&s;t the King referr'd the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s to a|nother Colloquie, which continu'd for Six days one after another, but without any Succe&s;s: A clear Te&s;timony that Controver&s;ies in Religion are not to be decided by Di&s;putes. After that, all the Clergy throw them&s;elves at the King's Feet, and with Sighs and Tears be&s;eech him, <HI>Not to change a Religion &s;o quietly E&s;tabli&s;h'd in</HI> Ethiopia <HI>for &s;o many Ages, by &s;o many of their Emperors.</HI> But nothing would prevail; the King remain'd inexorable and immoveable; &s;o that the Pe|titioners departed full freighted with Exa&s;peration and Re|bellion. Immediately, all hopes of Concord and Agree|ment being lay'd a&s;ide, the Sword was next un&s;heath'd, whence follow'd tho&s;e terrible Commotions and Bloody Wars that have almo&s;t ruin'd the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing part of <HI>Ethiopia.</HI></P>
<P>The Chief of the Con&s;pirators were <HI>Jamanaxus, Aelius</HI> the King's Son in Law, Viceroy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> the Eunuch <HI>Caflo,</HI> and &s;everal others. But to give the better Colour to their Rebellion, and De&s;ign of Killing the King, the Metropoli|tan, caus'd a new and more &s;evere Excommunication to be fix'd upon the Chief Church in the Camp, by which all the partakers of the Latin Religion were Anathematiz'd. In the mean time the Fathers of the Society relying upon the King's Favour, ha&s;ten'd to get all things ready that might be of advantage to E&s;tabli&s;h their Doctrine. To that end they tran&s;lated <HI>Maldonatus</HI> upon the Four Evangeli&s;ts; <HI>Tole|tus</HI> upon St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Romans, Ribera</HI> upon the <HI>He|brews,</HI> and &s;ome others, into the <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Language, which &s;ome e&s;teem'd, others by rea&s;on of the intermixture of <HI>Am|haric</HI> words, contemn'd, as full of Barbari&s;ms and Soloeci&s;ms. But as for the Lord's Prayer, and the Salutation of <HI>Mary,</HI> be|ing nothing but the Latin written in <HI>Ethiopic</HI> Characters, they abhorr'd 'em, as looking upon them to be nothing but Ma|gic Spells. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> fell upon the Fathers with all the bittere&s;t Invectives that might be; tho&s;e Paper Skirmi&s;hes being generally the fore-runners of more Bloody di&s;putes. In pur&s;uance of which, <HI>Aelius</HI> by an
<PB N="332" REF="157">
Edict, Commands all the <HI>Franks</HI> to depart out of <HI>Tigra,</HI> and the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> to follow him: by which means, having mu&s;ter'd up a compleat Army, he openly Rebels. <HI>Simeon</HI> Cur&s;es the <HI>Franks,</HI> but loads <HI>Aelius</HI> with his Ble&s;&s;ings; upon which he no doubt relying, re&s;olv'd to fight his Father in Law, then upon his March again&s;t him with a &s;trong Force, notwith&s;tanding all the Per&s;wa&s;ions of his Wife to the con|trary. Fierce therefore, and in the heat of his young Blood, and over-confident of his own Faction, not &s;taying &s;o much as to take his Breakfa&s;t, but as it were Drunk with Fury and Rage, only with a &s;mall Troop about him, he leaps his Hor&s;e into his Father's Camp, asking, <HI>Where the King was?</HI> and &s;o what between the a&s;toni&s;hment of &s;ome, and the wonder of others what the Matter &s;hould be, he rode up without any hurt to the King's Pavilion; where at length the Alarum being taken, he was &s;oon &s;urrounded, Ston'd and Stabb'd to Death, and &s;o dearly paid for his ra&s;hne&s;s. The Captain thus Slain, the Soldiers betake them&s;elves to their heels; <HI>Simeon,</HI> between the Fugitives and the Pur&s;uers, &s;tood alone by him&s;elf, like a man &s;tupifyed, whether not at fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd, or neglected as a Clergy-man, but at length being known, he was Slain among the Crowd. Both their Heads were &s;ent about the Kingdom, and expos'd as a Public Spectacle. The Eunuch <HI>Caflo</HI> had his Head &s;truck off: <HI>Jamanaxus</HI> was pardon'd. Thus the Kindred of Kings for the mo&s;t part e&s;cape the Puni&s;hment of tho&s;e Rebel|lions to which they them&s;elves have given Life and Encou|ragement.</P>
<P>The King who was never fearful, now more emboldened by his Victory, now que&s;tions other Heads of Religion: and &s;oon after by Public Edict prohibits the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, as <HI>Judaical,</HI> and Repugnant to Chri&s;tianity. In an&s;wer to this Edict, &s;ome Per&s;on without a Name, had written contemptuou&s;ly of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, reflecting &s;everely upon the Fathers of the Society, whom he call'd <HI>the Kindred of</HI> Pilate, as being a <HI>Roman,</HI> and withal &s;harply menacing the King him&s;elf. <HI>Tellez</HI> reports, That it was &s;tufft with places of Scripture, but nothing to the purpo&s;e. The King more incens'd by this Writing, renew'd the Edict about the Sabbath, and commanded the Husbandmen to Plough and Sow upon that Day, adding as a Penalty upon the Offenders, for the fir&s;t Fault the Forfeiture of a weav'd
<PB N="333" REF="157">
Ve&s;tment to the value of a <HI>Portugal</HI> Patack; for the &s;econd, Confi&s;cation of Goods, and that the &s;aid Offence &s;hould not be pre&s;cribed to Seven years; a certain form u&s;ually in|&s;erted in their more &s;evere Decrees.</P>
<P>Certainly it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be true what <HI>Tellez</HI> reports of the Natural Piety of the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> &s;ince they were thus to be compell'd to the Neglect of the Sabbath by &s;uch Se|vere Laws, when we can hardly be induc'd by &s;tricter Pe|nalties to ob&s;erve the Lord's-Day. Among the re&s;t, one <HI>Bu|cus</HI> a &s;tout and famous Soldier, felt the utmo&s;t rigour of this Decree, for being accus'd to have ob&s;erv'd the Sabbath, he was made a mo&s;t &s;evere Example, that others of le&s;s con&s;e|quence might not think to expect any Mercy.</P>
<P>From thence <HI>Jonael</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Bagemdra</HI> took an occa&s;ion to Revolt, alluring all to his Party who were di&s;plea&s;ed with the Edicts. Upon which News, many of the chiefe&s;t of the Court, both Men and Women, of which &s;everal were near allyed to the King, with Tears in their Eyes be&s;ought him once more, not to expo&s;e him&s;elf and the Kingdom to Calamity, but to take Pity upon &s;o many poor afflicted People, offend|ing out of meer Simplicity and Ignorance, and not to di&s;turb the Minds of his People with &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable Changes.</P>
<P>The King far from being mov'd with their Tears, but rather the more di&s;pleas'd to &s;ee &s;o many all of one Mind, that at once he might an&s;wer all, confirm the wa|vering, and terrifie the Head&s;trong, having &s;ummon'd to|gether the Chief Nobles and Commanders of his Army that attended the Court, in a &s;hort, but grave Oration, put them in mind of pa&s;t Tran&s;actions, upbraiding them a|mong the re&s;t, <HI>For that they had depriv'd</HI> Zadenghel <HI>both of his Life and Kingdom, becau&s;e he had for&s;aken the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Religion to embrace the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith. That for his part, after his Victory obtain'd against</HI> Jacob, <HI>he had bin &s;evere to none; but rather had pardon'd all; neverthele&s;s he was di&s;turb'd with daily Seditions and Rebellions, under pretence of changing his Reli|gion, when he only reform'd it. For that he acknowledg'd as much and the &s;ame that others did, That</HI> Chri&s;t was true God, and true Man: <HI>but becau&s;e he could not be Perfect God, unle&s;s he had the Perfect Divine Nature, nor perfect Man without perfect Humane Nature, it follow'd, that there were two Natures in Chri&s;t, uni|ted in one Sub&s;tance of the Eternal Word. Which was not to aban|don but explain his Religion. In the next place he had abrogated
<PB N="334" REF="158">
the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath Day, becau&s;e it became not</HI> Chri|&s;tians <HI>to ob&s;erve the</HI> Jews <HI>Sabboth. The&s;e things he did not be|lieve in favour of the</HI> Portugue&s;es; <HI>but becau&s;e it was the Truth it &s;elf determin'd in the Council of</HI> Chalcedon, <HI>founded upon Scripture, and ever &s;ince the time of the Apo&s;tles deliver'd as it were from hand to hand; and if there were occa&s;ion, he would lay down his life in defence of this Doctrine; but they who deny'd it &s;hould fir&s;t examine the Truth of it.</HI></P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed his Oration, a Letter was brought him from <HI>Jonael,</HI> containing many haughty Demands, and among the re&s;t the Expul&s;ion of the Je&s;uits. The King believing there would be no better way than to an&s;wer him in the Field, Commanded the nimble&s;t of his Armed Bands to March: of which the Rebel having Intelligence, and not willing to abide his Fury fled for &s;helter among tho&s;e in|acce&s;&s;ible Rocks, whither it was in vain to pur&s;ue him. Thereupon <HI>Su&s;neus,</HI> well-knowing that the Revolters would not be able long to endure the Inconveniencies, and Fa|mine that lodg'd among tho&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible places, blockt him up at a Di&s;tance. So that <HI>Jonael</HI> at length, weaken'd by daily de&s;ertions, fled to the <HI>Gallans,</HI> who being at variance among them&s;elves, kept their promis'd Faith but a &s;hort time; for being underhand tempted with Rewards by the King; they at length turn'd their Protection into Trea|chery, and &s;lew the Unfortunate Implorer of their Se|curity.</P>
<P>This Bad Succe&s;s however did not terrifie the Inhabitants of <HI>Damota,</HI> inhabiting the Southern parts of <HI>Gojam,</HI> who up|on the News of the <HI>Prophanation of the Sabbath,</HI> as they called it, with their Hermites that &s;culk'd in the De&s;erts of that Province, ran to their Arms. <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> otherwi&s;e their Lord and Patron in vain Exhorting them to continue their Obedience, who&s;e kind Me&s;&s;ages of Peace and Pardon they refus'd, <HI>unle&s;s he would burn the Books Tran&s;lated out of</HI> Latin <HI>into the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ine <HI>Language by the Fathers, and deliver up the</HI> Fathers <HI>them&s;elves to be Hang'd upon the highe&s;t Trees they could find.</HI> Thus de&s;pairing of Peace, <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> &s;et forward, tho de&s;erted by the greate&s;t part of his Forces, who favoured the Cau&s;e of their Countrymen; &s;o that he had hardly Seven Thou&s;and Men that &s;took clo&s;e to him, while the Enemies Body daily encreas'd. However he re&s;olv'd to Fight them, knowing his Soldiers to be more Experienc'd,
<PB N="335" REF="158">
and better Arm'd, be&s;ides that he had about Forty <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Mu&s;quetiers in his Camp. When they came to blows, the Victory fell to the King's Party, tho it co&s;t dear; in regard that about Four hundred Monks, that had as it were devoted them&s;elves to die for their Religion, fought mo&s;t de&s;perate|ly: of which a Hundred and four&s;core were Slain.</P>
<P>Hitherto the King had not made Publick Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, partly out of fear of &s;tirring up Popular Tumults again&s;t him; partly being loath to di&s;mi&s;s his Super|numerary Wives, and Concubines; but at length encourag'd by &s;o many Victories he lay'd all fear a&s;ide, and publickly renounc'd the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Wor&s;hip, and confe&s;&s;ing his Sins after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner to <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> di&s;mi&s;s'd all his Wives and Concubines, only the fir&s;t of tho&s;e to which he had bin lawfully Marry'd. His Example convinc'd many others, who were not a&s;ham'd to keep many Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, but Adul|tre&s;&s;es al&s;o. Not long after, the King &s;ignify'd his Conver|&s;ion to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion to his whole Empire, by a Pub|lick In&s;trument, not without the Severe reproof of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Patriarch. The &s;um of his <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> was, <HI>That having de&s;erted the</HI> Alexandrinian, <HI>he now reverenced only the</HI> Roman <HI>See; and had yielded his Obedience to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope, as the Succe&s;&s;or of</HI> Peter, <HI>the Prince of the Apo&s;tles; for that that See could never err either in Faith or good Manners,</HI> and then he exhorted his Subjects to do as he had done. He al&s;o di&s;cour&s;ed at large concerning the two Natures in Chri&s;t, and tax'd the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Primates as guilty of many Errors. But neither the King's Example, nor his Exhortation wrought upon many. For at the &s;ame time his Son <HI>Gabriel</HI> began to &s;tudy new Con|trivances, tho with no better Succe&s;s than they who had taught him the way. For when he had intelligence that <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> was marching again&s;t him, finding him&s;elf Infe|rior in Force, he betook him&s;elf to the inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks of <HI>Shewa;</HI> from whence at la&s;t by the Craft of a certain well|brib'd <HI>Gallan,</HI> he was allur'd to come forth; who feigning him&s;elf to be highly offended with <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> came to the unwary young Prince, and promis'd him the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of all his Friends; which while he was inveagled out to expect, in a neighbouring Wood, he was there &s;urrounded by a &s;elect Party of the Enemy, and pay'd for his ra&s;h belief with the lo&s;s of his Life.</P>

New Di&s;turbances occa|&s;ion'd by the new Computation. Bapti&s;m and Ordination reiterated: Ser|mons. Vi&s;itation and Confirmation. A Countryman's Joke. A Seminary. <HI>Tecla-George</HI> Revolts. Suppre&s;s'd and Hang'd. The Captain of the Guards excommunicated upon a &s;light Occa&s;ion by the Patriarch; but Pardon'd at the King's interce&s;&s;ion. Their Courtiers offended. Their Indignation increa&s;es, and why. A Witch impri&s;on'd by Command of the Patriarch: Which alienates the King's Affection from him. His Authority decrea&s;es, through private Grudges, and an Act of <HI>Ras Seelax.</HI> The <HI>Agawi</HI> Revolt.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF The&s;e pro&s;perous Succe&s;&s;es, the Fathers wrote pre&s;ently to <HI>Rome,</HI> and into <HI>Portugal.</HI> But very prudently, there was nothing ra&s;hly decreed at fir&s;t, le&s;t the De&s;ign of another Patriarch, like that of <HI>No|nius Barret</HI> &s;hould come to nothing. But when King <HI>Su&s;|neus</HI> him&s;elf, had by his own Letters reque&s;ted a Patriarch, and had made publick Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion, the Conclave then thought it not expedient to make any longer delays. And therefore, as if they had bin to &s;end into &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Province, upon the Nomination of <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, then King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> as well as <HI>Spain, Alphon&s;us Mendez,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Eminency, by Nativity a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> a Doctor in Theology, and of the Society of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> which claim'd <HI>Ethiopia</HI> peculiarly to it &s;elf, as a Province by them wholly converted to the Faith, was created Patriarch.

Be&s;ides, that it might have occa&s;ion'd great Emulation, had a Per&s;on bin cho&s;en out of any other Nation or Society. Being inaugurated with the u&s;ual Ceremonies, at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> in the Month of <HI>May</HI> 1624. he &s;et Sail, and arriv'd at <HI>Goa,</HI> where under&s;tanding that all things &s;ucceeded to the wi&s;hes of the <HI>Fathers,</HI> he prepar'd for his farther Journey.

While he &s;tay'd at <HI>Dio,</HI> he was &s;ea&s;onably forewarn'd by the King's Letters, by no means to come near <HI>Suaqena</HI> or <HI>Matzua,</HI> but to make to rights for <HI>Baylur</HI> a Port of <HI>Dancala.</HI> There he arriv'd the Third of <HI>April</HI> following with &s;ix Companions, four <HI>Fathers;</HI> and two Friers.</P>

came &s;o late, that the Viceroy had forgot it. So that his Reception there was very lamentable, there being little or no Provi&s;ion, &s;o much as of Nece&s;&s;aries made for him. And their Ho&s;ts where they Lodg'd, were &s;o poor and cove|tous, that in&s;tead of receiving any Kindne&s;&s;es from them, they were forc'd to purcha&s;e their &s;orry Convenience with the continual Supplies of their Avarice. They could not get Mules or Hor&s;es anow to carry them&s;elves and their Luggage; &s;o that mo&s;t of them were forc'd to travel over the rugged and parch'd Earth in continual conflict with hun|ger, thir&s;t, and intolerable heat.</P>
<P>Neither were they much better entertain'd for Sixteen days in the Court of the Viceroy him&s;elf, all their Pre&s;ents not &s;ufficing to gratifie the impatient Appetite of his Avarice. Parting from thence, at the Mercy of tho&s;e wicked and co|vetous Varlets that were their Guides and Owners of their Carriage-Hor&s;es, they travel'd as they were led, in daily fear of the <HI>Gallans,</HI> over places where Battels had bin fought, as it were Pav'd with the Skulls and Bones of the Slain, till at la&s;t all the&s;e Difficulties and Dangers overcome, they were met by <HI>Emanuel Barradas,</HI> with &s;ome other <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> and <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> upon the Confines of <HI>Tigra,</HI> who furni&s;h'd them with Provi&s;ions, Carriages, and all other things nece&s;&s;ary. Upon the &s;trength of which Refre&s;hments, they began to a&s;cend the towring Mountains of <HI>Aba&s;&s;ia,</HI> and the Fifth day after, through more glad&s;om and verdant Fields, and more grateful opportunities of re&s;ting them&s;elves, they arriv'd at <HI>Fremona;</HI> where they &s;tay'd not only all the Winter, but all <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> being both unhealthy Months.

Being &s;o &s;ate, the Patriarch made a mo&s;t lofty Panegyric in Prai&s;e of the Pope, not without &s;ome Reflections upon the Blindne&s;s of former Ages: then he fell to commemorate what had been done of later Times, How, <HI>That the Emperors of</HI> Habe&s;&s;inia <HI>had &s;ent their Emba&s;&s;adors formerly to</HI> Rome, <HI>and that lately one of them had reque&s;ted thence a Pa&s;tor, and Evangelical Preachers: that therefore now the Time was come, wherein his Maje&s;ty was bound to &s;atisfie the de&s;ire of his Ance&s;tors, and to &s;ubmit him&s;elf and his Subjects to the See of</HI> Rome. The King Commanded the Grand Chamberlain of his Hou&s;hold <HI>Melca Chri&s;tos,</HI> Prince of <HI>Samena</HI> to return an An&s;wer; who after he had extoll'd the Merits of the <HI>Portugue&s;es, It is now the King's Intention,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>to fulfil the Promi&s;es of his Ance&s;tors, by yielding Obedience to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope;</HI> But as he was going on, the King interrupted him, &s;aying, <HI>That this was not the fir&s;t day of his Intention to &s;ur|render his &s;ubmi&s;sion to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope, as having long before promis'd it to the Superior Father of the Society of</HI> Je&s;us.

<P>The &s;ame year al&s;o <HI>Lent</HI> was kept after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, with all the Solemnities of the Pa&s;&s;ion Week, as al&s;o <HI>Easter</HI> ac|cording to the <HI>Roman</HI> Calendar. Which occa&s;ion'd mo&s;t vio|lent Commotions over all the Empire, and more e&s;pecially among the Clergy and Monks.

<P>In the mean time they were very bu&s;ie in Baptizing the Converted, and ordaining of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per&s;ons, many of which had bin already Baptiz'd and Ordain'd.

<PB N="342" REF="162">
Thus the Fathers of the Society made a daily and very great Progre&s;s, in&s;omuch that the Number of Baptiz'd and Converted to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion amounted to many Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>About two years after, the Patriarch made a Vi&s;itation a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the Sodality, in which va&s;t Numbers of People were &s;ome of them Rebaptiz'd, others Con|firm'd; to the great good-liking and applau&s;e of the King and his Peers, who had never &s;een &s;uch things perform'd by any of their Metropolitans before. Others look'd a&s;quint upon the&s;e pro&s;perous beginnings, &s;eeking all Occa&s;ions of new Di&s;turbances. Some there were that openly re&s;i&s;ted, and would not permit any Prie&s;t under <HI>Roman</HI> Ordination to officiate in their Churches, nay &s;ome of them they kill'd out-right. As for the Countrey People, tho they were pa&s;|&s;ively Obedient to the King's Commands, yet they lik'd their own old way be&s;t. Among the re&s;t there was one, who having receiv'd the Cuff of Confirmation, as their manner is, and being ask'd by his Neighbour how he did? <HI>Never wor&s;e,</HI> &s;aid He, <HI>than I have bin &s;ince I receiv'd the Patriarch's Box o'th' ear.</HI></P>
<P>More than all this, there was a <HI>Seminary</HI> &s;et up, for the Education as well of the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> as <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Children: for the Encouragement of whom, and to invite others, they caus'd &s;ome of the young Lads to Act a Comedy after the <HI>European</HI> manner. But when they brought in Devils upon the Stage, as the Scene requir'd, &s;ome of the ignorant Peo|ple, believing them real Hobgoblins, were &s;o terrify'd, that they flung out of the School, crying out, <HI>Wajelan, Wa|jelan, Sajetanet ametzea: O Dear! O Dear! they have brought us Devils.</HI></P>
<P>But the en&s;uing Tragedies more terrify'd the wi&s;er &s;ort. For <HI>Tecla-George,</HI> another of the King's Sons in Law, for his Wives &s;ake, at difference with his Father, having drawn in|to the &s;ame Con&s;piracy with him two Noblemen, <HI>Gebra-Marjam,</HI> and <HI>John Acayo,</HI> revolted openly, and by a Cryer &s;olemnly proclaim'd, <HI>That he renounc'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Wor&s;hip, and would Protect the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>by force of Arms.</HI> And that the world might believe he was in Earne&s;t, he caus'd all the Crucifixes, Ro&s;aries, and other Ornaments of Popi&s;h Super|&s;tition to be burnt in a publick fire; and to the end there might be no hopes of Reconciliation left for the Expectation

of Confederates, he took his Chaplain <HI>Abba Jacob;</HI> who offi|ciated after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, and after he had di&s;poyl'd him of his Stole and Hood, put him to Death.</P>
<P>The King could not brook &s;o great an Indignity, and there|fore &s;ent <HI>Kebax,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Tigra,</HI> with an Army again&s;t him, who us'd &s;uch extraordinary Diligence, that he &s;oon &s;ur|priz'd the &s;ecure and unprovided Rebel, overthrew his Army, and took him and his Si&s;ter <HI>Adera</HI> Pri&s;oners: who, becau&s;e they had &s;o furiou&s;ly and contemptuou&s;ly acted again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, were both hang'd upon a high Tree. Nor could all the Interce&s;&s;ions of the Queen, nor of all the Noble Ladies could prevail, tho they pleaded hard the di&s;grace done to their Sex, and that it was never before known in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> that a Noblewoman was Hang'd: e&s;pecially being call'd by the King to behold &s;o &s;ad and infamous a Spectacle. For they did not pity her becau&s;e they thought her Innocent, but for the Ignominy of her Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>After this follow'd &s;everal other Accidents, which as they brought a very great Odium upon the Patriarch and the Fa|thers, &s;o were they reckn'd to be the Cau&s;es of the general aver&s;ne&s;s of the People to the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion. The Patri|arch, that he might exerci&s;e all his Authority in one &s;ingle Act, and &s;hew the full extent of his Power, having taken a pett again&s;t the Captain of the King's Guards, for &s;ome fri|volous Bu&s;ine&s;s that nothing belong'd to his Juri&s;diction, publickly in the Church, in the pre&s;ence of the whole Court, thunders out an Anathema again&s;t him, and &s;ent him Po&s;t to the Devil. It &s;eems he had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain Farms, which the Monks lay'd claim to, and refus'd to re&s;tore them, notwith&s;tanding all the Admonitions of the Patriarch. The Nobleman, tho a Soldier, hearing &s;uch a mo&s;t Dreadful Ex|communication, by vertue whereof he was &s;ent packing to Hell, laden with all the Cur&s;es of <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> like one Thunder-&s;trook, fell into a Sound, and lay for Dead. But the Storm did not continue long: For pre&s;ently the King &s;tept in to his relief, by who&s;e interpo&s;ition, and the Media|tion of &s;everal of the Nobility, he was re-admitted into the &s;tate of Grace. However it was an Act which the Nobility took mo&s;t heinou&s;ly to heart; among whom there were &s;ome that frown'd and chaf'd out of meer Indignation, to &s;ee that their Church &s;hould be brought to &s;uch a degree of Ser|vitude, that a Foreign Prie&s;t &s;hould take upon him with &s;o

much Arrogance to Excommunicate and Bequeath to Eternal Damnation, one of the Chief Coun&s;ellors of their King|dom, an Ancient and Famous Per&s;onage, for the &s;ake of a Litigious Farm, which the King might take when he pleas'd from the Monks them&s;elves, if they were the Owners.</P>
<P>This Flame was fed by the addition of more fuel; For the <HI>Icegue</HI> or Chief Abbot of the Monks being at that time lately Deceas'd, who as we have already &s;aid, is the next in Dignity and Authority to the <HI>Abuna,</HI> he was Buried in a cer|tain Church, con&s;ecrated after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner, tho he had bin an ob&s;tinate Zealot for the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. Thereupon the Patriarch, after he had &s;oundly reprov'd the Rector of the Church, <HI>Pronounc'd the Church profan'd by the Burial of a Heretic; and therefore that Ma&s;s could not be &s;aid in it.</HI> The Rector dreading the fatal &s;troak of the &s;ame di&s;mal <HI>Da|than</HI> and <HI>Abiram</HI> Thunderbolt, that lay'd the Great Comman|der &s;prawling, without expecting any new Command, cau&s;es the Carka&s;s to be digg'd up again, and thrown by. This the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> heavily exclaim'd again&s;t, crying out, <HI>That the</HI> Franks <HI>exerci&s;ed more cruel Severities upon them, then their mo&s;t ex|a&s;perated Enemies ever practis'd among them, to deprive their Dead of decent Burial: now they might all &s;ee what the Living were to expect. Tellez</HI> adds, That a certain old Woman was ca&s;t into Pri&s;on, upon Su&s;pition of being a Witch, but was pre|&s;ently &s;et at liberty, becau&s;e it gave di&s;ta&s;te. For that the mo&s;t Learned of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> are of Opinion, <HI>That there are now no more Magicians or Witches in the World; and therefore that the Woman was unju&s;tly wrong'd, who was thrown into Pri&s;on by the Command of the Patriarch.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the Minds of the People being generally incens'd, the King him&s;elf began to look upon the&s;e acts of &s;eparate Juri&s;diction in the Patriarch, as Diminutions of his Prero|gative (the ancient Metropolitans never daring to attempt &s;uch things), and con&s;equently to alienate his Affections both from him and from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> &s;o that at length he gave ear to their Adver&s;aries. Who to bring down and curb the Exce&s;&s;ive Power of the Patriarch, which &s;eem'd &s;o into|lerable to them, more e&s;pecially becau&s;e they found him &s;till inexorable in Matrimonial Cau&s;es, prohibited by Divine and Canon-Law; but chiefly in ca&s;es of Polygamy and Divorce; they began their Addre&s;&s;es to him for tho&s;e things, which
<PB N="345" REF="163">
they knew he could not deny without bringing great mi&s;|chief upon him&s;elf. Fir&s;t, <HI>That they might have liberty to &s;ay Ma&s;s after the ancient</HI> Ethiopian <HI>manner; for that the Patriarch might mend the ancient forms, where Nece&s;sity requir'd, without abrogating the whole. That the People hearing their ancient Ser|vices, would be the more quiet, in regard they would not &s;o much mind the difference between the New and the Ancient form of Wor&s;hip.</HI> The Patriarch gave way to their de&s;ires, only mending the Ethiopic Ma&s;s, but with apparent Detriment to his Authori|ty. For now the ancient Liturgies were every day read again without Contradiction; the Report running abroad that the Emperor was return'd to the Old Religion. The Patriarch's Power thus &s;haken, the Courtiers &s;till whi&s;per'd in the King's Ears, <HI>That the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion was become odious to all the People, and that his Per&s;on would be in great Danger, un|le&s;s he al&s;o for&s;ook it him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e In&s;inuations were back't by an Accident, which tho ridiculous in it &s;elf, gave a <HI>being</HI> to &s;everal Rumors and Reports. For one day an Enthu&s;ia&s;t came into the Palace, and cry'd out, That he was &s;ent from God and the mo&s;t Ho|ly Virgin, to declare in their own words to the <HI>King, that unle&s;s he forthwith return'd to the antient Religion, he &s;hould with|in a Fortnight undergo mo&s;t &s;evere Chasti&s;ements.</HI> The King made an&s;wer, <HI>That he would live and die in the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion:</HI> and that the Me&s;&s;enger might the more &s;peedily return his an&s;wer, <HI>Commanded him to be Hang'd.</HI> But at the Interce&s;&s;ion of &s;everal who a&s;&s;erted the poor Fellow to be Frantick, he only receiv'd a &s;evere drubbing, for the reward of his &s;awcy Prophe&s;ie. Howevet tho he were laugh'd at by the Cour|tiers, yet he &s;o &s;trangely &s;tirr'd the minds of the Vulgar, that they publickly reported, <HI>That an Angel had bin &s;ent from Hea|ven, and that he had admoni&s;h'd the King to return to the ancient</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Faith.</HI> In the mean while the inbred hatred again&s;t the Fathers daily increa&s;ing, was greatly augmented by the envy of the Courtiers. For they incens'd the King and his Elde&s;t Son again&s;t <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> the Fathers chief Friend, and Patron of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> under pretence of their great care, admon&s;hing the two Princes, <HI>To take heed that he did not abu&s;e the Renown he had won in War, and the favour of the</HI> Portugue&s;es, <HI>to invade the Royal Dignity.</HI> That which more heighten'd the&s;e growing Jealou&s;ies, was a mi&s;interpreted act of <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> who having order'd one <HI>Lecanax</HI> to be ap|prehended
<PB N="346" REF="164">
for Calumnies and Scandalous Reports thrown upon him&s;elf, caus'd him afterwards to be put to Death, tho he had appeal'd to the King. This they &s;aid was done by <HI>Seelax,</HI> not that the Per&s;on was guilty of the Crimes which were lay'd to his Charge, but to remove out of the way one that was Privy to the Trea&s;ons and Con&s;piracies of <HI>See|lax.</HI> Whereupon the King depriv'd him in&s;tantly of great part of his Lands, remov'd him out of <HI>Gojam,</HI> and took from him his Military Commands.</P>
<P>In the mean time, tho <HI>Tecla-George</HI> had &s;uffer'd, and that the Heads of the Rebellion were taken off, yet the Rebellion it &s;elf continu'd, and the &s;trength of it daily increas'd in &s;uch manner, that it became the Original of Di&s;mal and Diutur|nal Commotions. For the <HI>Agawi,</HI> that inhabit the Moun|tains of <HI>Bagemdra,</HI> had not yet lay'd down their Arms; but being, as they pretended, more and more provok'd by-the King, kept them in their hands to revenge their Injuries. And the better to defend them&s;elves, they call'd to their Aid, one <HI>Melcax,</HI> a young Man of the Royal Blood, who had bin bred among the <HI>Gallans,</HI> and created him their Lea|der. To him therefore, as to a Sanctuary, flock'd all tho&s;e that bare any di&s;affection to the King, all that hated the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Religion, e&s;pecially the Monks; and la&s;tly, &s;everal of the Villagers and Country People. All the&s;e thus embody'd, were call'd <HI>La&s;teners,</HI> from <HI>La&s;ta,</HI> a mo&s;t invincible Rock, and the chief Seat of the Rebellion. And indeed it &s;eem'd a va&s;t Torrent of War, ready to break forth to the utter Ex|tirpation of the Fathers, and all tho&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Reli|gion, if it prov'd &s;o kind to &s;pare the Royal Family it &s;elf. Again&s;t the&s;e therefore the King, having rais'd an Army of Seven and twenty Thou&s;and Men, marches him&s;elf in Per|&s;on, but with ill &s;ucce&s;s at fir&s;t. For the Country People, defended by the Security of the place, as the Royali&s;ts came on, &s;till beat them off, by rolling down whole Quarries at a time of ponderous Stones upon their heads, which having put the Royali&s;ts into great di&s;order, they came down, and &s;ur|rounded all the King's Left Wing, &s;o that had not <HI>Kebax</HI> come to their relief with 300 fre&s;h Men, they had bin all cut to pieces. The Soldiers being di&s;courag'd by this over|throw, the King who for that rea&s;on dur&s;t not adventure any further for that time, left part of his Army to defend the Borders, and ha&s;t'ning home, was forc'd to recall <HI>See-lax,</HI>

lurking like an Exile in <HI>Gojam.</HI> In the mean time the Tute|lar Bands, whether for fear, or finding them&s;elves too weak, for&s;ook their Po&s;ts, &s;o that the <HI>La&s;taneers</HI> ravag'd all the Country as they pleas'd, without Oppo&s;ition, till <HI>Seelax</HI> be|ing got within their reach, drave them back into their for|mer Holes.</P>
<P>While this Rebellion rag'd in <HI>Bagemdra,</HI> another broke out in <HI>Amhara;</HI> being headed by <HI>Luca-Marjam,</HI> near in Blood to the Royal Family; but he being prevented and &s;urpriz'd by the &s;wift March of <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> ended his Days and his De&s;ign together, by falling from the Precipice of a Rock.</P>
<P>But the &s;ame good Fortune did not attend <HI>Kebax,</HI> who impatient of delay, and ob&s;erving the Avenues more negli|gently guarded than they us'd to be, the bait that betray'd him, conceiv'd no le&s;s than that <HI>Opportunity</HI> it &s;elf had now proffer'd him the Victory. So in he marches, finding all clear before him for the pre&s;ent; but no &s;ooner was he in, when tho&s;e Mountaneers accu&s;tom'd to clamber their own Rocks, and us'd to the By-ways and conceal'd Pa&s;&s;ages of that Rock, were all on a &s;udden before and behind him; &s;o that after a great Slaughter of his Men, de&s;erted by the re&s;t, he was him&s;elf after a matchle&s;s defence, oppre&s;s'd by Multi|tudes, and Slain.</P>
<P>His, and the Fall of <HI>Tegur-Egzi,</HI> which &s;oon after fol|low'd, gave the Fathers no cau&s;e of Thank&s;givings, but af|forded their Enemies great Opportunities, and great Argu|ments to pre&s;s the King to withdraw his Favours from them. For ob&s;erving their time, when they perceiv'd him &s;ad, and perplex'd at &s;o much ill Succe&s;s, and &s;o many Revolts, <HI>Oh Sir,</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>What will be the I&s;&s;ue of all the&s;e Combats and pernicious Wars? Tho&s;e illiterate Swains under&s;tand not the My&s;te|ries of the</HI> Roman <HI>Wor&s;hip, nor any other Service of God then what they have bin bred and brought up to.

<P>For <HI>Melcax,</HI> pufft up with the Succe&s;s of his Affairs, was arriv'd at that height of boldne&s;s, that nothing now would &s;erve him but the a&s;&s;um'd Title of a King.

For all that abominated the <HI>Fathers,</HI> chiefly the No|bility of <HI>Tigra,</HI> privately gave him Encouragements, and exhorted him, <HI>not to de&s;i&s;t from what he had &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly begun; and that then, neither the Affections of the People, nor the A&s;si&s;tance of his Friends would be wanting.</HI> Elated with the&s;e golden Promi&s;es, his Temerity carry'd him &s;o far, as to &s;end, as if he had now bin the undoubted King of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> a Vice|roy into <HI>Tigra.</HI> To this Viceroy he allow'd a Select Band of Soldiers for his Convoy; but they, neglectful and care|le&s;s of their Military Duties, took their Plea&s;ure &s;o much, that at length &s;urpriz'd in the mid&s;t of their Jollity by the Royali&s;ts, they were forc'd to leave Four thou&s;and of their Party behind them, Slain upon the Spot; while the &s;hatter'd Remainders &s;peeded back, to lay the blame of their ill Suc|ce&s;s upon the unwary Conduct of their Leaders. But the <HI>La&s;taneers,</HI> intent upon revenge, had at length the &s;ame ad|vantage again&s;t the Royali&s;ts, who were &s;tragling to de&s;troy the approaching Harve&s;t, and pay'd them home with equal Slaughter for Slaughter. Thus Fortune ballancing both &s;ides, the Author of the&s;e Mi&s;carriages was enquir'd after, and as &s;oon found by tho&s;e that watched their Opportunities. For pre&s;ently <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> was accus'd, as if he had bin negligent in Executing the King's Orders, and had not &s;ent timely Succors to the over-power'd Combatants. And his Enemies &s;o far prevail'd, that Articles were fram'd again&s;t him, to which he was compell'd to an&s;wer: which he did, and ju&s;tify'd him&s;elf &s;o well, that in words indeed he was acquitted, but in Fact condemn'd. For he was again de|graded, and all his feudary Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Military Employ|ments granted away to <HI>Ba&s;ilides.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> being once more lay'd by, it was no diffi|cult matter to undermine the Patriarch and the Fathers. For again&s;t them the general Complaint was made, <HI>That they had no other De&s;ign, but as they had &s;ubjected the Empire in Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Affairs to the</HI> Roman <HI>Pope, &s;o to bring it under the Dominion of the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>in Seculars. To this end under the pretence of Temples and Re&s;idencies they rear'd up Ca&s;tles and Walls, from whence they could never be expell'd with Spears and Arrows.</HI> Many other things of the &s;ame Nature, they &s;ugge&s;ted, which if the King now through Age more jealous, did not ab&s;olutely believe, yet he hearken'd to them with a more ea&s;ie Attention. However outwardly and publick he &s;hew'd
<PB N="349" REF="165">
the &s;ame Kindne&s;s and Affability to the Fathers as before, and kindly receiv'd the Bi&s;hop &s;ent from <HI>Rome</HI> to be a Coadjutor to the Patriarch. But when he brought the <HI>Diploma</HI>'s of the Jubilee open'd at <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1625. and then granted to <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he was derided by mo&s;t Men, who could not comprehend tho&s;e great Vertues of Indulgencies which the Bi&s;hop boa&s;ted of. For &s;ome began to Di&s;cour&s;e among them&s;elves like the Phari&s;ees, <HI>Who is this who al&s;o forgives Sins? Who can forgive Sins but only God?</HI> To which the King made an&s;wer with a &s;evere Countenance, <HI>That the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven were given to</HI> Peter, <HI>and that the u&s;e of tho&s;e Keys belong'd to the Pope, for the Granting Indul|gencies.</HI></P>
<P>However the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> as if tho&s;e Indulgencies had afforded Materials for Sin, bent them&s;elves &s;till more and more to Sedition and Tumult. For the Revolt of the <HI>La|&s;taneers</HI> &s;o well &s;ucceeding, <HI>Sertzazax,</HI> newly made Viceroy of <HI>Gojam,</HI> &s;o ill repay'd the King for his new favours, that he not only revolted from him him&s;elf; but which was more dete&s;table to think, he would have drawn in the young <HI>Ba&s;ilides</HI> to have con&s;pir'd with him again&s;t his own Father. And when he could not prevail upon the young Prince, he endeavour'd to have advanc'd another young Noble Gentleman of the Blood Royal, to the end he might have reign'd him&s;elf under his Name. But being over|thrown and taken, he was drubb'd to Death. Seven of his Accomplices lo&s;t their Heads. One of his chief Agents, becau&s;e he had vented horrid Bla&s;phemies again&s;t the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and opprobrious words again&s;t the King, was hung up upon an Iron Hook driven into a high Stake; upon which, after he had hung a whole Day, becau&s;e he repeated the &s;ame Provocations in the mid&s;t of his Torment, he was at length run thorough the Body with &s;everal Spears; and &s;o ended his mi&s;erable Life. So many, and &s;uch lamentable Accidents as the&s;e pierc'd the very hearts of mo&s;t People, and the <HI>La&s;taneers,</HI> di&s;pairing of Pardon, hearing of &s;uch horrid Executions, were the more re&s;olute in their Re|bellion.</P>
<P>Thereupon the King undertook a new Expedition with all his Forces again&s;t them, and had taken the very Head and Ring-leader of all the Rebels, had he not with a &s;mall Reti|nue made a &s;hift to E&s;cape; yet he left behind him great

&s;tore of rich Plunder. But he could not be utterly Subdu'd, in regard that &s;o many Sculking Holes, &s;o many wide and &s;pacious Rocks, where tho&s;e Savages liv'd and hid them|&s;elves, like &s;o many wild Bea&s;ts, could neither be a&s;&s;ail'd nor taken. It happen'd therefore, that Fortune wheeling about, the Rebels overthrew a Select Party of the King's Forces: and by and by with all their force lay hovering about the King's Army, which they fore&s;aw would in a &s;hort time want Provi&s;ion. The King therefore fearing to be clos'd up in tho&s;e narrow Streights, retir'd into <HI>Dembea,</HI> before the War was at an end. Which he did with &s;o much ha&s;t more then it was thought he needed to have done, that as it dimini&s;h'd his own fame, &s;o it gave Courage to the Rebels.</P>
<P>And now the Fathers great Enemies beholding the King's Melancholly, redoubled their Complaints. <HI>That there would never be peaceful Days in</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>&s;o long as the</HI> Roman <HI>Reli|gion bare &s;o much &s;way. That it was a very good Religion, but above the Capacity of the People, who would &s;till prefer the Wor|&s;hip of their Ance&s;tors, to which they had bin bred from their In|fancy, before foreign Innovations, which they under&s;tood not. For who &s;hould per&s;wade them,</HI> That Circumci&s;ion was evil, That the Holydaies of the Sabbath are not plea&s;ing to God; that the ancient Liturgy cannot be prov'd, That the <HI>Roman</HI> Ca|lendar is better then the <HI>Ethiopic;</HI> That the Fa&s;ts of the Fourth Holyday are le&s;s acceptable to God, then the Fa&s;ts of the Seventh? <HI>How much more expedient and profitable were it, to retain the ancient Ceremonies in &s;uch things as do not contradict the Sub&s;tance of Faith? But as for</HI> Ras-Seelax, <HI>and others that endeavour the Contrary, it was apparent they did it meerly to advance their own De&s;igns again&s;t the King and Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>With the&s;e and &s;uch like Expo&s;tulations, the King being overcome, e&s;pecially finding no other way of appea&s;ing and quietting the <HI>La&s;teneers,</HI> and that <HI>Bagemdra</HI> was almo&s;t all in the Hands of the Enemy, and at the &s;ame time all his Friends, e&s;pecially the Ladies of Quality laying before him the Danger he would be in, &s;hould he be de&s;erted by his Sol|diers, he at length pre&s;s'd the Patriarch, to remit whatever po&s;&s;ibly might be remitted. He fore&s;eeing a terrible Storm, tho &s;ore again&s;t his Will, thought 'twas high time to lower his Sails, for fear of Lo&s;ing all, while he hazarded the Saving of all. Whereupon he &s;ubmitted to the King's reque&s;t; never|thele&s;s
<PB N="351" REF="166">
upon Condition, <HI>That nothing Decreed &s;hould be remitted by Publick Acts, but only by a Tacit Connivance, and that in the mean time there &s;hould be a Ce&s;&s;ation of all Penalties, and Mulcts.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the King intending a Third Expedition again&s;t the <HI>La&s;teneers,</HI> to make his Soldiers the more &s;tedfa&s;t and obe|dient, he put forth an Edict; by which, in general words an Indulgence was granted for the Exerci&s;e of all ancient Ceremonies, not repugnant to Faith. Thus every Per&s;on being left to his particular Liberty, the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Wor&s;hip was again, to the great Satisfaction of the People, freely ex|ercis'd; but to the great grief of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> e&s;pecially the Patriarch, who pre&s;ently wrote to the King, complain|ing, <HI>That contrary to his advice, a Lay Prince &s;hould publi&s;h an E|dict of that Nature in reference to &s;piritual Affairs:</HI> for that it belong'd to him to &s;et forth &s;uch Decrees; putting him in mind of the words of <HI>Azariah</HI> the High-Prie&s;t to King <HI>Uzziah,</HI> and of the Puni&s;hment that follow'd, and admoni&s;hing him to amend that Fault, by publi&s;hing &s;ome other Edict, which &s;hould be propos'd by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome one of the Fa|thers of the Society. The King obey'd and propounded an Edict, which contain'd Three Articles.</P>

<ITEM>1. <HI>That the Ancient Liturgy, but Corrected, &s;hould be read in the Ma&s;s.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That the Fe&s;tivals &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd according to the ancient Computation of Time, except</HI> Ea&s;ter, <HI>and tho&s;e other Fe&s;tivals that depended upon it.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>That who&s;oever pleas'd, in&s;tead of the Sabbath, might fa&s;t upon the fourth Holyday.</HI> And then as for an&s;wer to the Patri|archs Complaints, he made this reply, <HI>That the</HI> Roman <HI>Reli|gion was not introduc'd into his Dominions by the Preaching or Mira|cles of the Fathers, but meerly by his Edicts and Commands, not by the a&s;&s;ent of his People, but of his own free will, becau&s;e he thought it better then the</HI> Alexandrian. <HI>Therefore the Patriarch had no rea|&s;on to Complain.</HI> But the&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions not being &s;ufficient, and coming too late, prov'd altogether ineffectual; not &s;erving in the lea&s;t to pacifie the <HI>La&s;teneers,</HI> or any other of the Di&s;|contented Parties.</ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Decrea&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, and the Re&s;toration of the <HI>Alexandrinian.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Fathers ill Succe&s;s. The King prepares to re&s;tore the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Re|ligion. Over-per&s;waded by the Queen and his Son. The Decrees re&s;olv'd on in Council. The Patriarch makes a grave Speech to the contrary. &V;pbraids him with his Victories and threatens him. At length he Suppli|cates, but in vain. The Edict pa&s;&s;es. Signify'd to the Patriarch, who propo&s;es a Medium. The Edict publi&s;h'd to the great Satisfaction of the People. The Ancient Ceremonies us'd. An Invective Satyr again&s;t the Fathers. The &s;udden Change cen&s;ur'd.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WEE have hitherto &s;een the great Progre&s;s of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion in <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> the Authority of the Patriarch advanc'd to the utmo&s;t extent; the King and his Brothers, together with a great many of the Nobility, &s;ome &s;incerely, &s;ome feignedly favouring the Je|&s;uits. For the Latin Wor&s;hip was with great diligence im|pos'd and exercis'd all over &s;everal Provinces of the King|dom. Many of the <HI>Habe&s;sine</HI> Prie&s;ts were Ordain'd by the Patriarch; and great diligence was us'd for the building of Churches and Colleges. Already be&s;ides the Patriarch they had increas'd their Number to One and twenty Companions, that is to &s;ay, Nineteen Fathers, and Two Brothers of the Society, di&s;tributed into Thirteen Re&s;idencies. Nor could the Fathers but be well pleas'd with &s;o many Thou&s;ands of Baptized and Converted People; for certainly the gaining of &s;o many lo&s;t Souls by Bapti&s;m was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed. When on a &s;uddain behold a &s;uddain Change, upon which the Bani&s;hment of the Fathers, and the Subver&s;ion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion en&s;u'd.</P>
<P>For the Fathers believing that the opportunity of the time was not to be neglected, made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to abrogate all the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Rites, even tho&s;e which were formerly tolerated under the <HI>Roman</HI> Bi&s;hops: on the other &s;ide, the Common People Wedded to their Old Cu&s;toms; but more e&s;pecially the Monks and Clergy, the chief Supporters of the old Religion, mo&s;t &s;toutly oppos'd their Proceedings. Be&s;ides them, &s;everal of the Nobility, either out of Hatred
<PB N="353" REF="167">
of the <HI>Romans,</HI> or out of Ambition, frequently revolted, and through the &s;trength of their unacce&s;&s;ible Rocks ea&s;ily eluded the King's more mighty Power. A mo&s;t remarkable Le&s;&s;on to teach us, <HI>That that &s;ort of Wor&s;hip to which the People are aver&s;e, is not ea&s;ily to be introduc'd by the Prince; and that it is no piece of Prudence or Policy to attempt the Liberty of tho&s;e who are well defended by the Situation of their Country.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the King, tho otherwi&s;e mo&s;t addicted to the Fathers, wearied with &s;o many Exclamations of his own Peo|ple, growing in years, utterly di&s;liking the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of Affairs, and fearful of what might en&s;ue, tormented with the continual Importunities of his Friends; his Jealou&s;ie of his Brother, the Contumacy of the <HI>La&s;teneers,</HI> the Diminu|tion of his Prerogative, and the dread of lo&s;ing his King|dom, at length began to think of abrogating the <HI>Roman,</HI> and re&s;toring the ancient <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Wor&s;hip. And which was more to be admir'd, a pro&s;perous Fight with the <HI>La&s;teneers,</HI> was that which &s;ettled his wavering Thoughts. For making a fourth Expedition again&s;t them, he came upon them &s;o unlook'd for, that he gave them a Total tout, Killing eight Thou&s;and upon the place, with &s;everal of the Leaders of the Faction, and chief De&s;erters of their King and Country. The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> rejoyc'd at the News, believing the Rebel|lion quietted by this Victory; and that for the future nothing would pre&s;ume &s;o much as to hi&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion. But it fell out quite otherwi&s;e. For they who favour'd the the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion, the next day carry'd the King to view the Field of the Battel, and &s;hewing him the multi|tude of the Slain, thus be&s;pake him. <HI>Neither</HI> Ethnics <HI>nor</HI> Mahumetans <HI>were the&s;e, in who&s;e Slaughter we might have &s;ome rea&s;on to rejoyce. No, Sir, they were Chri&s;tians, once your Sub|jects, and our dear Countrymen; and partly to your &s;elf, partly to us related in Blood. How much more laudable would it have bin for the&s;e couragious Brea&s;ts to have bin oppos'd again&s;t the mo&s;t deadly of your Enemies? This is no Victory, becau&s;e obtain'd again&s;t your own Subjects. With the &s;ame Sword wherewith you Slaughter them, you Stab your own Bowels: Certainly they bare no hatred to us, whom we make War upon &s;o cruelly. Only they are a ver&s;e to that Wor&s;hip to which you would compel them. How many have we already kill'd upon this Change of Ceremonies? How many re|main behind re&s;erv'd for the &s;ame Slaughter? When will the&s;e Bloody Conflicts end? Forbear, we be&s;eech your Maje&s;ty, to con&s;train them
<PB N="354" REF="168">
to Novelties, and Innovations, le&s;t they renounce their Allegiance: otherwi&s;e we &s;hall never behold the Face of Peace again. We are hated even by the</HI> Gallans <HI>and</HI> Ethnicks <HI>for abandoning our ancient Ceremonies, and are therefore by them call'd Apo&s;tates.</HI> For it &s;eems that the King of <HI>Adel,</HI> having apprehended and put to Death two of the <HI>Fathers</HI> travelling into <HI>Habe&s;sinia</HI> thorow his Country, in the accompt which he gave to <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> of what he had done, haughtily call'd him Apo&s;tate. Nor is it to be que&s;tion'd but that the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and Neighbour|ing Nations were much Scandaliz'd at the Alteration of the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> into the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion; not out of any love to the one, or hatred to the other; but for fear the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> &s;trengthen'd by the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> &s;hould become their Ma&s;ters. The <HI>Turks</HI> al&s;o were mad that the Metropolitan of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> was no more to be &s;ent for out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> for by that &s;ame Tye they held the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> fa&s;t, and lyable to what Con|ditions they pleas'd.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ince&s;&s;ant Importunities, the Queen joyn'd the pow'rful Charms of her own Supplication, conjuring him by all the Obligations of Sacred Wedlock, and common Pledges of their undoubted Offspring, <HI>To be well advi&s;ed what he did; and not to ruin his Kingdom, Him&s;elf, his Fortune, and his whole Family.</HI> With the &s;ame importunity his Elde&s;t Son <HI>Ba&s;ilides,</HI> and his Brother by the Mothers &s;ide <HI>Jamanax,</HI> hour|ly &s;ollicited his di&s;turb'd mind: and the better to accom|pli&s;h their ends, they underhand procur'd the <HI>Gallans</HI> that &s;erv'd the King, to de&s;ire a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, as being unwilling to fight any longer again&s;t the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> in a quarrel about a new Religion. Thus the King's rigor mollify'd at length, <HI>Ba&s;ilides,</HI> after he had &s;ummon'd the Nobility and chiefe&s;t of his Father's Coun&s;ellors together, held a Council, wherein it was concluded, That there was no other remedy to allay the Di&s;orders of the Kingdom, but by re&s;toring the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. And the better to per&s;wade tho&s;e that were of the Contrary Opinion, they gave it out that the <HI>Romanists</HI> and <HI>Alexandrians</HI> were of the &s;ame Opinion in points of Faith; That both affirm'd that God was true Chri&s;t, and true Man. And as for the a&s;&s;erting One or Two Natures, they were only words of little Moment, and not worth the Ruin of a Mighty Empire. So that the King induc'd by the&s;e rea&s;ons, gave liberty to every one that pleas'd to return to the <HI>Alexan|drian</HI> Forms.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="168">The Patriarch was not ignorant of the&s;e Tran&s;actions. Whereupon being accompanied with his Coadjutor, &amp; the chief of the Fathers, he de&s;ir'd Audience of the King. Which being granted, after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, <HI>Sir,</HI> &s;aid He, <HI>I had thought that we had lately bin the Victors, but now I &s;ee we are Vanqui&s;h'd: On the other &s;ide the</HI> La&s;teneers, <HI>being overthrown and put to flight, have obtain'd their de&s;ires. Before the Battel was fought 'twas then a time to Vow and Promi&s;e, but now to fulfil. The Victory was gain'd by the Catholic and</HI> Portugue&s;e <HI>Soldiers, the God of Ho&s;ts fa|vouring the Catholic Religion. The&s;e are therefore but ill returns to his Divinity; For I under&s;tand, here has bin a Decree made, giving free toleration again of the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Religion. But this is not a place I &s;ee to advi&s;e with Bi&s;hops and Religious Per&s;ons; the illite|rate Vulgar, the</HI> Gallans <HI>and</HI> Mahumetans, <HI>Women here give their Judgments in Matters of Religion. Con&s;ider how many Victories you have gain'd from the Rebels, &s;ince you have embrac'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion: Remember, that you embrac'd it, not compell'd by force or fear, but of your own free choice, as believing it the Truer. Neither did we come hither as Intruders; we were &s;ent hither, by the Pope and the King of</HI> Portugal <HI>at your request. Neither did they ever de&s;ign any other thing in their thoughts, but only to unite your Empire to the Church of</HI> Rome. <HI>And therefore beware of exciting their ju&s;t Indignation. They are 'tis true far di&s;tant hence; but God is at hand, and will require the Satisfaction which is due to them. You will throw an indelible blemi&s;h upon the Lion of the Tribe of</HI> Juda, <HI>which you bear for your Atchievement; You will blur your own re|nown, and the Glory of your Nation: La&s;tly, you will be the un|doubted occa&s;ion of innumerable Sins by y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Apostacy; which that I may not &s;ee, nor feel the threatning revenge of the Almighty, Com|mand this Head of mine to be immediately &s;trick'n off.</HI> This &s;aid, with tears in their Eyes, the Patriarch and his Companions fell Pro&s;trate at the King's feet, in expectation of his An&s;wer. The King not any way concern'd, reply'd in few words, <HI>That he had done as much as he could, but could do no more, neither was a total alteration of Religion intended, but only a Conce&s;sion of &s;ome Ceremonies.</HI> To which the Patriarch an&s;wer'd, <HI>That he had already tolerated &s;ome, and was ready to indulge more, which did not concern the Sub&s;tance of Faith: So that he would put forth another Edict, that all things might remain as they were.</HI> To which he receiv'd no other reply, but <HI>That the King would &s;end certain Commi&s;sioners to Treat and Di&s;cour&s;e with the Fathers.</HI> Nor had they a better an&s;wer from the Prince, who being an Arti&s;t

They pre&s;ently fell &s;harply to work with him, and upbraided him, <HI>with the frequent Rebellions of the People;</HI> Aelius, Cabrael, Tecla-George, <HI>and</HI> Sertzac, <HI>and with the Slaughter of &s;o many Thou&s;ands as fell with them.

<P>After a &s;hort time of Deliberation, an An&s;wer was car|ry'd back to the King by Father <HI>Emanuel D' Almeyda; That the Patriarch understood that the Exerci&s;e of both Religions would be free in his Kingdom. That for his part he had an equal love for</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>as for his own Native Country; and therefore for his part he was ready to grant what&s;oever might be done, with &s;afe|ty to the Purity of &s;ound Doctrine. But that there was &s;till a difference to be made between tho&s;e who had not yet embrac'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Religion, as the</HI> La&s;teneers, <HI>for that they might be con|niv'd at; but they who had po&s;itively embrac'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith, and had bin admitted to Confe&s;sion and the Sacraments, no indulgence could be granted to them, without committing a great Sin, to return to the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Schi&s;m.</HI></P>

<P>It is a thing almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be believ'd with what an Univer&s;al Joy this Edict was receiv'd among the People. The whole Camp, as if they had had &s;ome great Deliverance from the Enemy, rang with Shouts and Acclamations. The Monks and Clergy, who had felt the greate&s;t weight of the Fathers Hatred lifted up their Thankful voices to Heaven. The promi&s;cuous Multitude of Men and Women danc'd and caper'd; The Soldiers wi&s;h'd all happine&s;s to their Comman|ders: They brake to pieces their own and the Ro&s;aries of all they met, and &s;ome they burnt. Crying out, that it was &s;ufficient for them to believe, That Chri&s;t was true God and true Man, without the unnece&s;&s;ary Di&s;putes concerning the two Natures. From thenceforward the old Ceremonies were made u&s;e of in the Communion; Grape&s;tone Liquor in&s;tead of Wine. And the Holy Name of Je&s;us forbidden to be &s;o frequent in their Mouths, after the <HI>Roman</HI> manner; and &s;ome that did not ob&s;erve this Caution, they ran through with their Lances. Some few days after, a general Cir|cumci&s;ion was appointed, not minding the pain of &s;uch a piece of Vanity, &s;o they might not be thought to have neglected any thing of their ancient Rites in favour of the Fathers. Some there were al&s;o that us'd the ancient manner of wa&s;hing them&s;elves upon the Fe&s;tival of the Epiphany, be|lieving them&s;elves thereby purify'd from the guilt of hav|ing admitted the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion.</P>
<P>Others ran about Singing for joy that <HI>Ethiopia</HI> was deliver'd from the <HI>Western Lyons,</HI> Chanting forth the following Lines.</P>
<Q><L>At length the Sheep of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> free'd</L>

<P>And thus fell the whole Fabrick of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion, that had bin &s;o long rearing with &s;o much Labour and Ex|pence, and which had co&s;t the Effu&s;ion of &s;o much Blood to pull it down. So va&s;t and haughty Tow'rs that have bin long time Built, if once you undermine the Foundation, tumble in a moment. Some there were who accus'd the Fathers of the Society, as if they had ruin'd the fair Pro|gre&s;s they had made by double Diligence, and over-ha&s;ty Zeal. For mo&s;t of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> and many of the <HI>Ha|be&s;sines</HI> them&s;elves that were well affected to the <HI>Roman</HI> Reli|gion took it ill, that things &s;hould be &s;o &s;uddainly chang'd, which might have bin longer let alone, without the lea&s;t in|jury done to fundamental Faith. For as tall Trees, that have taken deep root, are not ea&s;ily Eradicated, &s;o inveterated Opinions, which we have as it were &s;uck't in with our Mo|ther's Milk are not to be overcome but by length of time, great Lenity, and much Patience. For Humane under|&s;tanding, if compell'd, puts on Ob&s;tinacy as it were in re|venge of injur'd Liberty. Nor did &s;ome that were the Fa|thers great Friends make any Que&s;tion, that had they left &s;ome things indifferent, which the Pope him&s;elf many times freely tolerates, &s;o it be acknowledg'd as the Act of his Be|nignity and Di&s;pen&s;ation, as the Computations of the holy Times, the Communion under both Kinds, and &s;ome other things which the Primitive Church without any Scandal to|lerated and permitted, as the Marriage of Prie&s;ts, the Fa&s;t of the fourth Holyday, the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, and &s;ome other things which depended meerly upon Cu&s;tom, and not upon Divine Precept, and had only minded in the mean time the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Conver&s;ion and Preaching, they had gain'd not only the <HI>Habe&s;sines,</HI> but the Pagans them&s;elves, and working by degrees, had brought their de&s;ign at length to perfection. But they relying wholly upon the Favour and Succe&s;&s;es of the King were pre&s;ently for compelling the <HI>Ha|be&s;sines</HI> to conform of a &s;uddain in all things to a &s;trange and uncouth Innovation. The Latin Tongue mu&s;t be us'd in

their Publick Sacred Wor&s;hip, and their daily Prayers, the Angelical Salutation, the Lord's Prayer and the Apo&s;tolic Creed mu&s;t be &s;aid in Latin, written in the Ethiopic Chara|cters, in which <HI>Eve Maria grazia Plena,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ounded &s;trange|ly and odly to the <HI>Habe&s;sinian</HI> Pronunciation. Which by de|grees &s;o alienated the Affections of the <HI>Habe&s;sinians</HI> from &s;uch a &s;ort of aukward Devotion, &s;o that at length all the Wars, Seditions, Pe&s;ts of Locu&s;ts, Famine, and all the Ca|lamities that follow'd, and the &s;evere Penalties that were inflicted upon the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> were lay'd upon the <HI>Fathers;</HI> which begat them Hatred in&s;tead of Reverence, and Bani&s;h|ment in the room of Favour and Affection.</P>
<P>From what has bin &s;aid, Men of Prudence will ea&s;ily find the cau&s;es of &s;o great a Mutation. Neverthele&s;s it will not be improper to add tho&s;e other which <HI>Tellez.</HI> has a&s;&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he &s;ays, That the &s;trict Tyes and Laws of Matri|mony according to the Catholic Faith, were not &s;o well brook'd by the <HI>Habe&s;sinians,</HI> being allow'd by the <HI>Alex|andrian</HI> Religion, to Marry one or more, and to Divorce, as they &s;aw good.</P>
<P>Secondly, That be&s;ides Incontinency, Avarice, Ambition, Envy, Hatred had got a head among them, e&s;pecially a|gain&s;t <HI>Ras-Seelax,</HI> who&s;e Power they could find no better way to pull down, than by Per&s;ecuting the <HI>Fathers;</HI> for whom he had &s;o indear'd a Kindne&s;s.</P>

<P>Sixthly, That the Monks were incens'd, to &s;ee the Fathers only in E&s;teem, and them&s;elves formerly &s;o high|ly reverenc'd, afterwards contemn'd and &s;lighted; &s;o

<P>Eighthly, That the Devil had put it into the Heads of &s;e|veral Catholicks to make a corre&s;ponding Agreement be|tween the Catholick and the <HI>Alexandrinian</HI> Religion; a&s;&s;ert|ing all to be Chri&s;tians, as well <HI>Alexandrians</HI> as <HI>Romans.</HI> That all believe in Chri&s;t; That Chri&s;t &s;aves all; That there is little Difference between both Religions; That both have Conveniencies and Inconveniencies, their Truths and their Errors, but that the Wheat was to be &s;eparated from the Cockle.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Expul&s;ion of the Patriarch, and the Exile|ment of the Fathers of the Society.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Alexandrians</HI> quarrel with the Fathers; who are accurs'd. Their Churches taken from them. <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> Dyes. <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> renouncing the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion is Overthrown and Bani&s;h'd. Others put to Death. The Fathers Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their Goods. Sent to <HI>Fremona.</HI> The Pa|triarch by Letters Demands of the King the Cau&s;es of his Bani&s;hment, and a New Di&s;pute. The King's An&s;wer. The Fathers depart for <HI>Fre|mona;</HI> Afterwards quite thrown out of the Kingdom.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter the Publication of the King's Edict, the <HI>Alex|andrians</HI> being now ab&s;olute Victors, endeavour'd with all their indu&s;try to be quit with the Fathers, and expel them quite out of <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI> To which purpo&s;e they omitted no occa&s;ion of daily quarrel and contention: Fir&s;t accu&s;ing the Patriarch for endeavouring by Seditious Sermons to &s;tir up the People to Sedition, and to turn them from the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion; for that he had openly exhorted his Hearers to <HI>Con&s;tancy.</HI> But under&s;tanding that <HI>Ba&s;ilides</HI> was di&s;pleas'd, and gave out threatning words, they thought it requi&s;ite to act more moderately. Soon after the <HI>Fathers</HI> Churches were taken from them, believing that would be a means to put a &s;top to the <HI>Roman</HI> Wor&s;hip. And fir&s;t they were con&s;train'd to quit their Cathedral at <HI>Gorgora,</HI> a &s;tately Structure after the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> manner. At their departure they carry'd with them all their Sacred Furniture, brake all the Sculpture, and &s;poil'd the Pictures, that they might not leave them to be the &s;port of their Adver&s;aries: doing that them&s;elves, which they thought the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> would do. And this Example they follow'd in all other places from whence they were expell'd. In the mid'&s;t of the&s;e Tran&s;actions, <HI>Su&s;n&egrave;us</HI>'s Di&s;temper increa&s;ing, and more and more aug|mented by his continual angui&s;h of Mind, he ended this Life the 16th day of <HI>Decemb.</HI> 1632.</P>
<P><PB N="362" REF="172">The King being Dead, the Fathers Adver&s;aries &s;et upon <HI>Ras-Seelax</HI> in the fir&s;t place, as the Principal Favou|rer and Protector of the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion: and fir&s;t of all they promi&s;e him all his former Dignities, all his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Goods, upon Condition he would return to the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. Upon his refu&s;al, they bring him bound in Chains before the King, and pronounce him guilty of Death. But the King declaring that he would not pollute his hands with the Blood of his Un|cle, commanded him to be carry'd to a certain remote Place, near to <HI>Samenar,</HI> and &s;eque&s;ter'd his Goods. And as he was great, &s;o was he attended in his fall by &s;e|veral others, as <HI>Atzai-Tino,</HI> Secretary of State, and the King's Hi&s;toriographer, <HI>Walata Georgi&s;&s;a,</HI> the Queens Cou|&s;in. In &s;hort, whoever had favour'd the Fathers, were all &s;ent into Exile, and &s;ome put to Death, perhaps be|cau&s;e they had bin more bitter in their Expre&s;&s;ions than others again&s;t the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion. For &s;ome had call'd it, <HI>a Religion for Dogs.</HI> After all this the Enemies of the Fathers &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, <HI>That nothing was yet done, &s;o long as the Patriarch and the Fathers were &s;uffer'd to abide within the Confines of the Kingdom: Neither would the</HI> La|&s;taneers <HI>be quiet till they heard the Fathers were all thrown out of</HI> Ethiopia, <HI>but would look upon all things tran&s;acted for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of the</HI> Alexandrian <HI>Religion as fictitious Stories.</HI></P>
<P>There needed not many words to pre&s;s him that was already willing. Fir&s;t of all therefore, their Goods and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were taken from them; then all their Arms, e&s;pecially their Mu&s;quets and Fire-Arms. But before that, they were &s;ent to <HI>Fremona,</HI> where, as we have already declar'd, <HI>Oviedo</HI> the Patriarch re&s;ided for &s;ome time. But before their Departure, the Patriarch wrote a certain Letter to the King, to this Effect:</P>
<P><HI>I did not adventure to come into</HI> Habe&s;&s;inia <HI>with my Com|panions, of my own accord, but by the Command of the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff, and the King of</HI> Portugal, <HI>at the request of your Father, where having taken the King's Oath of Obedience, I officiated the Office of Patriarch in the Name of the</HI> Roman <HI>Pontiff, and the King of</HI> Portugal. <HI>Now becau&s;e you Com|mand
<PB N="363" REF="172">
me to depart, my humble reque&s;t is, that your Maje&s;ty would &s;et down the Cau&s;es of my Exilement in Writing, &s;ub|&s;crib'd with your own, and the hands of &s;ome of your Coun&s;ellors and Peers, that all the World may know whether I am compell'd to &s;uffer for my Life and Conver&s;ation, or for the &s;ake of my Doctrine. I granted the Ceremonies de&s;ired by your Father, ex|cept the Communion under both Kinds, which only the Pope him&s;elf can di&s;pute with. The &s;ame al&s;o I again offer, &s;o that you and your Subjects will yield Obedience to the Church of</HI> Rome <HI>as the head of all other Churches. My last re|quest is, That as the Matter was Debated at first, &s;o it may be referr'd to another Di&s;pute; by which means the Truth of the whole affair will more manife&s;tly appear.</HI></P>
<P>To this Writing the King thus reply'd, <HI>Whatever was done by me before, was done by the Command of my Father, whom I was in Duty bound to Obey; &s;o that I was forc'd to wage War under his Conduct, both with Kindred and Subjects. But after the la&s;t Battel of</HI> Wainadega <HI>the Learned and Un|learned Clergy and Layety, Civil and Military, young and old, all &s;orts of Per&s;ons made their Addre&s;&s;es to my Father, Crying out,</HI> How long &s;hall we be perplexed and wearied with un|profitable things? How long &s;hall we encounter Bre|thren and Kindred, cutting off the right hand with the left? How long &s;hall we thru&s;t our Swords into our own Bowels? E&s;pecially &s;ince we learn nothing from the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion but what we knew before. For what the <HI>Romans</HI> call the two Natures in Chri&s;t, his Divinity and his Humanity, that we knew from the beginning to this time. For we all believe that our Lord Chri&s;t is perfect God and perfect Man; perfect God in his Divinity, and perfect Man in his Humanity. But in regard tho&s;e Natures are not &s;eparated nor di|vided; for neither of them &s;ub&s;i&s;t of its &s;elf, but both of them conjoyn'd the one with the other; therefore we do not &s;ay that they are two things. For one is made two, yet &s;o as the Natures are not mix'd in their Sub|&s;i&s;tence. <HI>This Controver&s;ie therefore among us is of little mo|ment; neither was it for this that there has bin &s;o much Blood&s;hed among us, but chiefly becau&s;e the Blood was deny'd to the Layety, whereas Chri&s;t has &s;aid in his Go&s;pel,</HI> Unle&s;s ye eat the fle&s;h of the Son of Man, and drink his blood,
<PB N="364" REF="173">
ye &s;hall not have life everla&s;ting; <HI>and when he in&s;tituted the Holy Supper, he did not &s;ay, The Blood is in my Body, which I have given to you alone; but take and drink, and partake all. From that time the Di&s;ciples did as they were commanded. The In|termi&s;sion of the Fa&s;t of the fourth Holyday, which is neverthe|le&s;s enjoyn'd by the Canons of the Holy Apo&s;tles: as al&s;o a va|rious manner of Fa&s;ting in the Time of</HI> Lent. <HI>Be&s;ides by al|tering the Order of the whole Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Computation in reference to the Annual Fe&s;tivals, and the Permi&s;sion of all Per|&s;ons to enter into the Church, without any di&s;tinction of clean or unclean; the&s;e are the things that gave offence to our People. But they dete&s;ted nothing more, than the reiteration of Bapti&s;m, as if we had bin Heathens, before we had bin Baptiz'd by the Fathers. They re-ordain'd our Prie&s;ts and Deacons, they burnt the wooden Che&s;ts of our Altars, and Con&s;ecrated &s;ome Altars of their own, as if ours had not bin Con&s;ecrated before. The Monks al&s;o complain'd, that their In&s;titutions were abrogated. The&s;e and others of the &s;ame Nature were the true Cau&s;es, that we abandon'd the</HI> Roman <HI>Faith, tho it was not we who gave it Protection but our Father. And therefore, becau&s;e the</HI> Alexandrian Abuna <HI>is now upon his Journey hither, and hath &s;ent us word, that he cannot live or joyntly act in the &s;ame Kingdom with the</HI> Roman <HI>Patriarch, and the Fathers, we command you to ha&s;ten to</HI> Fremona. <HI>Tho&s;e things are offer'd now too late, which might have bin ea&s;ily at fir&s;t allow'd: For now there is no return|ing to that, which all the whole Nation abhors and dete&s;ts: for which rea&s;on, all farther Colloquies and Di&s;putes will be in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The Patriarch relates in his Epi&s;tle to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> That that &s;ame Metropolitan, of whom the King makes mention, came &s;ome years before into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but lay pri|vately conceal'd in <HI>Enarea,</HI> where hearing of the di&s;own|ing and ca&s;ting off the Patriarch, he brake out into this far|ther Expre&s;&s;ion, to the King, <HI>That he could not officiate in his Office, unle&s;s the Patriarch and the Fathers were either put to Death, or Bani&s;h'd to perpetuity.</HI> So that the Patriarch and the Fathers were forc'd to obey the King's Command, not without a long Di&s;pute about their Guns, which they would willing|ly have kept for their own Pre&s;ervation; but they were forc'd to deliver them up, that they might be of no u&s;e to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who were coming, as it was fear'd and report|ed, to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus the Patriarch with all the Fa|thers that were then in the Country, were con&s;train'd to leave
<PB N="365" REF="173">
their warm Seats after an Enjoyment of Eight years &s;tanding. In their return they met with various Misfortunes, and were frequently infe&s;ted with Thieves, before they could get to <HI>Fremona.</HI> But becau&s;e they fore&s;aw, that would be no abi|ding place for'em of any long continuance, they pre&s;ently re&s;olv'd to &s;end away &s;ome of the Fathers before into <HI>India,</HI> to give the Vice-Roy an accompt of the &s;tate of their affairs, and to de&s;ire &s;ome remedy, that is to &s;ay, a good &s;ufficient &s;trength of <HI>Portugue&s;is.</HI> But before they could obtain that, they receiv'd fre&s;h Commands from the King (who 'tis very probable &s;melt their De&s;ign) to remove from <HI>Fremona</HI> and be gon. But they &s;ang loath to depart a great while, and to &s;pin out time, privately retir'd to one <HI>John Akay,</HI> formerly an Enemy to the King, who not being able to defend them, they were pull'd out thence by the Ears, and in <HI>May</HI> 1634. deliver'd to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and fir&s;t carry'd to <HI>Arkiko</HI> and <HI>Matzua,</HI> after that to <HI>Suaqena,</HI> and brought beore the <HI>Turki&s;h Ba&s;ha.</HI> And indeed there was nothing more that provok'd the <HI>Ha|be&s;sines,</HI> as <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, then that they &s;hould require aid of the Military Power from <HI>India</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h their Religion: <HI>They might,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>have &s;haken the du&s;t from their &s;hoes at their departure, as the Apo&s;tles were commanded; but they were for &s;ettling Religion with Swords and Guns.</HI> Which was not done &s;o &s;ecretly but it came to the Ears of the <HI>Habe&s;sines;</HI> for it &s;eems that &s;ome of their Train, vext at &s;ome Misfortune or other, had imprudently threaten'd it.

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding the King's Commands to all in ge|neral, the Patriarch left behind privately in &s;everal places <HI>Apollinaris Almeyda, Hiacynthos Franci&s;co, Ludo|vigo Cordeyra, Bruno Bruni</HI> and &s;ome others, who after they had liv'd mi&s;erably for &s;ome time, lurking up and down, at la&s;t were mo&s;t of them Hang'd.

<P>As for the Patriarch, after a long Captivity and very bad U&s;age from the <HI>Turks,</HI> he was at length &s;et at Liberty, after he had pay'd for him&s;elf and his Companions a Ran|&s;om of 4000 <HI>German</HI> Dolars, and &s;o at length got &s;afe to <HI>Goa.</HI> Where, tho he were advis'd to go him&s;elf into <HI>Portu|gual,</HI> and give an accompt of the afflicted State of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> he thought it the better way to &s;end <HI>Jeronymo Lobo,</HI> with or|der to de&s;ire the Aid of a &s;ufficient Military Power, to re&s;tore him to his lo&s;t See. Thereupon the diligent Je&s;uit, not only went into <HI>Portugal,</HI> but al&s;o to <HI>Mantua</HI> to <HI>Philip</HI> the Fourth, and from thence to <HI>Rome.</HI> But all his Negotiations prov'd ineffectual; whether it were that they did not think it at that in&s;tant &s;o Apo&s;tolical a way to propagate the Go&s;pel by force of Arms; or whether it were that they did not like the Charge of an Expedition, from whence they could hope for little good, there being no con&s;iderable Party in the Kingdom to give them footing, and the encouragement of A&s;&s;i&s;tance. For the King watchful over all ca&s;ualties, put all to Death that favour'd the <HI>Roman Fathers.</HI> Which occa&s;ion'd the Ruin of many of the No|bility; among the re&s;t <HI>Tecla-Selax;</HI> and &s;everal Prie&s;ts that had taken <HI>Roman</HI> Orders; and all the Fathers, except <HI>Ber|nard Nogueyra,</HI> whom the Patriarch had created his Vicar. For tho the Patriarch attempted afterwards to &s;end &s;eve|ral other Fathers, yet all their Endeavours were in vain; &s;o that for a long time he could learn no News concerning the State of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs in <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI> For the King fearing le&s;t the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> &s;hould invade his Dominions in revenge of the Fathers, had brib'd the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Ba&s;ha's of
<PB N="368" REF="175">
<HI>Suaqena</HI> and <HI>Matzua,</HI> willing enough to that of them&s;elves, not to admit entrance to any of the <HI>Franks.</HI></P>
<P>The News of which coming to <HI>Rome,</HI> the Minds of men were variou&s;ly affected. The greate&s;t part were &s;orry that all their fair hopes of retaining <HI>Ethiopia</HI> in Pontifical Obedi|ence were quite cut off. Others blam'd the Fathers of the Society, that through their Arrogance and Imprudence in managing the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Habe&s;sines;</HI> they had ruin'd both them&s;elves and the <HI>Roman</HI> Religion; whereas they ought to have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to have acted chiefly and in the fir&s;t place for the Maje&s;ty, and Au|thority of the Pope over the Univer&s;al Church, and willingly to have &s;uffer'd all Mi&s;eries, and Martyrdoms, rather than have quitted their Station. <HI>Tellez</HI> involves the&s;e particulars in a general Relation, &s;aying, That &s;everal Malevolent Re|ports were &s;pread about in <HI>Rome;</HI> and &s;ome there were who gave out, That the <HI>Fathers,</HI> out of meer dete&s;tation of their Per&s;ons, and hatred of the whole Nation of <HI>Portugal</HI> were ejected out of <HI>Habe&s;sinia:</HI> and that if other Preachers were &s;ent, the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> would willingly embrace both them and their Doctrine. Which was a thing to be done with much le&s;s Expence, and more probable to come to effect than <HI>Lobo</HI>'s Project of &s;ending an Army.</P>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Congregation for propagating the Faith,</HI> took another Cour&s;e, and &s;ent Six <HI>Capuchin</HI> Fryers, all <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> with Letters of Recommendation and &s;afe Conduct from the Emperor of the <HI>Turks</HI> him&s;elf, with Orders to try what they could do in <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI> Two of the&s;e going by Sea, landed at <HI>Magado&s;o,</HI> &s;eated upon the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa;</HI> but before they could get many Leagues up into the Countrey, they were knock't o'the head by the Cafers. Two of them got as far as the Confines of <HI>Habe&s;sinia;</HI> but being di&s;cover'd, they were pre&s;ently Commanded either to return back, or make Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> Religion; and upon their refu&s;al to do either, were pre&s;ently &s;ton'd to Death. Of which, when the other two that &s;tay'd at <HI>Matzua</HI> had notice, they rather cho&s;e to return home again than &s;uffer Martyr|dom to no purpo&s;e.</P>

But the King to retaliate their Kindne&s;s, wrote back not to them, but to the Ba&s;ha of <HI>Suaqena,</HI> to &s;end him only their Heads; which the Ba&s;ha in hopes of a Reward, very readily did, with a more than ordinary Ceremony. For after he had caus'd their Heads to be &s;trucken off, he or|der'd the Skins to be flea'd off, and &s;o &s;ent them to the King, that by their Colour he might know them to be <HI>Franks,</HI> and by their Shaving to be <HI>Priests.</HI></P>
<P>At length al&s;o <HI>Bernard Nogueira</HI> was apprehended, the la&s;t of all the Fathers, and fairly Hang'd. As for the Patriarch <HI>Mendez,</HI> he liv'd in <HI>India</HI> till the year 1656. Where in the 22d of his Exile, and the 77th of his Age he dy'd upon the 29 day of <HI>January.</HI> He was endu'd with mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd gifts both of Body and Mind, very Tall, and of a firm Con&s;titu|tion of Body, well read both in the Greek and Latin, and every way fitted for his Employment. Neither had he want|ed Prudence, had not the King's Favour and Succe&s;s which oftentimes intoxicate the Wi&s;e&s;t of Men, tran&s;|ported him out of the way to act with that violence and &s;everity where gentlene&s;s and caution were &s;o requi&s;ite. By which means, in&s;tead of gaining, he was forc'd to &s;uffer the &s;hameful detriment of that Authority, which he had too far extended. Others, as <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, excus'd him, for that upon his arrival he found things &s;o far driven on by the Mi&s;|&s;ionaries, that he could not with Honour recede from what they had done. Since the Death of the Patriarch we have had no certain Relations out of <HI>Habe&s;sinia.</HI> In the year 1652. a new Metropolitan was &s;ent into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> who had bin &s;een by many <HI>Europeans</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and was &s;ucceeded afterwards by &s;everal others, as we have gather'd from certain Relation. From whence we may infer, That the report of <HI>Tellez</HI> was a thing fram'd out of Envy; as if the King of the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> had &s;ent his Amba&s;&s;adors into <HI>Arabia,</HI> to de&s;ire thence Maho|metan Doctors, with an intention to embrace Turci&s;m, which no man can think probable, from what has bin alrea|dy related. For how is it likely that he who could not Pro|tect the &s;plendid Religion of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, and the &s;pe|cious Doctrines of the Fathers, becau&s;e they were thought by the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> to be repugnant to Scripture, and the De|crees of the Primitive Church, &s;hould be able to admit of the Vanity and Ab&s;urdity of Mahumeti&s;m: the Original and Progre&s;s of which is &s;o well known to the <HI>Habe&s;sines</HI> already.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the Letters u&s;ed by the <HI>Ethiopians.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>They obtain'd the u&s;e of Letters with their Divine Wor&s;hip. The Ori|ginal of the Greek and Latine Letters. The <HI>Ethiopic</HI> more agreeable with the <HI>Samaritan</HI> then <HI>Hebrew</HI> Characters. The Inventor of theirs, ignorant both of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Greek:</HI> The Letters ancient, but not all invented at the &s;ame time. The <HI>Amharic</HI> Characters. The &s;tory of the <HI>Chaldaic</HI> and Holy Character refuted.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THat Learning and Divine Wor&s;hip generally go together, we have hinted already. For we &s;ee it has &s;o happen'd among mo&s;t Na|tions of <HI>Europe;</HI> which when they gave the name to the Latine Church, entertain'd al&s;o its Letters, and mo&s;t of its words. Sometimes al&s;o New Letters have aboli&s;h'd the u&s;e of Old ones, as we find by the Example of the<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">They are call'd <HI>Runer</HI> in the North, and are to be &s;een engrav'd upon Stones in &s;everal places. See <HI>Wormias</HI>'s <HI>Runic Literature</HI> and the <HI>Runic Lexicon</HI> Printed at <HI>Copenhagen.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Runic</HI> Letters of the Ancient
<PB N="376" REF="179">
<HI>Goths,</HI> in the time of Chri&s;tianity. Thus the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> receiv'd their Letters, together with their Divine Wor&s;hip from the <HI>Greek</HI> Church. Over all the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and the greate&s;t part of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Arabic</HI> Literature and Language crept in, toge|ther with <HI>I&s;lami&s;m,</HI> the Ancient <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> being thrown out, and all other Nations, if there were any that us'd the <HI>Arabic</HI> Letters before. And as for our own Native Characters, as we expre&s;s them in Writing, though they &s;eem to differ very much from the <HI>Latine</HI> and <HI>Greek,</HI> e&s;pecially while the Letters are &s;o vary'd and transform'd with the &s;trokes and da&s;hes of various hands as fancy and &s;wiftne&s;s of Writing guides the Pen, yet if we more accurately con&s;ider the old Characters, and tho&s;e the &s;ame as they appear in Printing, we &s;hall find it no great difficulty to derive them from the Ancient <HI>Latine.</HI></P>
<P>It is the Ancient Opinion of the Learned, That <HI>Cadmus</HI> re|commended the <HI>Phenician</HI> Letters to the <HI>Greeks;</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the <HI>Latines;</HI> and they to all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe;</HI> fir&s;t by means of their Conque&s;ts, then of their Religion, though there be every where a great difference in the &s;hape of the Letters: among tho&s;e Nations al&s;o that u&s;e the <HI>Arabic</HI> Let|ters, there is a va&s;t variety of Writing. Not to &s;peak of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> but of the <HI>Moors,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern People</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> who&s;e Letters, though Originally <HI>Arabic,</HI> you &s;hall hardly under&s;tand.</P>
<P>But as to what concerns our <HI>Ethiopic Letters,</HI> &s;ome of them indeed may corre&s;pond in Name, but in &s;hape there is not the lea&s;t appearance of &s;imilitude: &s;o that if an Argument were to be drawn from the Letters, we might &s;ay, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> receiv'd neither their Divine nor Civil Wor&s;hip from the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI> Neverthele&s;s they &s;eem to have &s;ome cor|re&s;pondence with the <HI>Samaritan</HI> Characters, which many mo&s;t Judicious Men acknowledge for the Original and Genu|ine Letters of the Ancient <HI>Hebrews:</HI> and yet neit her will the&s;e without a great deal of Labour, be brought to any A&s;&s;imu|lation. We &s;hall give you a view of the two <HI>Alphabets</HI> both together.</P>

<P>Their manner of Admini&s;tring <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> is mo&s;t Deplorable, They Cure Men by cutting and burning, as they do Hor&s;es. They cure the <HI>Yellow Jaundies,</HI> by applying a hot burning Iron in manner of a Semicircle, toward the upper end of the Arm, laying a little Cotton upon the Wound, that the Humour may i&s;&s;ue forth, &s;o long as the Di&s;ea&s;e remains. In mo&s;t Di&s;tempers, every Per&s;on is his own Phy&s;itian, and u&s;es &s;uch Herbs as he learnt were u&s;eful from his Parents. Some are of Opinion, that it is not a Pin matter, whether they make u&s;e of <HI>Phy&s;itians</HI> or Apothecaries or no, not believing it worth their while to be recover'd at &s;o great Expences. If the King be &s;ick, they come to him, ask him, as if it were out of pity, <HI>What he ayles, and what is his Di&s;temper?</HI> And if any one have been ill of the &s;ame Di&s;temper, he tells, what did him good, deeming the &s;ame Remedies applicable to all Con|&s;titutions. If a Pe&s;tilence chance to break out, they leave their Hou&s;es and Villages, and retire with their Heards in|to the Mountains, putting all their Security in flying from the Contagion. <HI>Tertian Agues</HI> they Cure, by applying the <HI>Cramp-fi&s;h</HI> to the Patient, which is an un&s;peakable Torture. <HI>Wounds</HI> they Cure by the help of <HI>Myrrhe,</HI> which is very plen|tiful among them.</P>
<P>I have not as yet ever &s;een the Treati&s;e of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which I mention'd at the beginning of the Chapter; but it appears by the Theological Di&s;putations of their Divines, that they are none of the Acute&s;t Logicians; nor have they any know|ledge of Natural Philo&s;ophy, as is apparent to any one that reads their Books, concerning the mixture of the Four Ele|ments in the Creation of Man; as al&s;o, concerning the Soul, the Author of the <HI>Organum</HI> gives this accompt.</P>
<P><HI>God made a Miracle when he Created our Father</HI> Adam, <HI>and Formed him of the Four Elements: he mixed the Elements, yet &s;o that they &s;hould not di&s;agree among them&s;elves; the Fir&s;t with the Second, and the Third with the Fourth: he mix'd the dry with the Moi&s;t, and the Hot with the Cold; the Vi&s;ible with the Invi&s;ible, the Palpable with the Impalpable: He made Two out of the Pal|pable
<PB N="381" REF="181">
and Two out of the Impalpable: He made Three of the Dry, and One of the Moi&s;t: He made Three out of the Vi&s;ible, and One out of the Invi&s;ible. The great Architect knew where the In|ner Chamber was to be Seated, and plac'd the Corners of the Hou&s;e in the Four</HI> Elements; <HI>and under&s;tanding that a ve&s;&s;el of Clay could not move nor &s;peak, without the mixture of a Spirit that mu&s;t come from Him&s;elf, therefore he Breath'd upon his Face and made him Rational and Self-moving; as &s;aith the mo&s;t Holy Law.</HI> He Breath'd into the Face of <HI>Adam,</HI> the breathing place of Life; and he became Man by the Breath of Life. <HI>Therefore the Soul dies not with the Body; for that proceeding out of the Mouth of the Lord, it was mixt with the Body: as &s;aith our Lord in the Go&s;pel,</HI> Fear not tho&s;e who kill the Body, but cannot kill the Soul. <HI>Now as to what he &s;aid,</HI> Thou &s;halt not kill the Soul; <HI>be &s;poke concerning the &s;en&s;itive Soul: becau&s;e there are two Souls in Man; one the</HI> Spirit of Life, <HI>which proceeded out of the Mouth of God, not reckon'd among the</HI> Elements, <HI>and which never dyes. The other is, the</HI> Blood of the Body; <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> the Sen&s;itive Soul, <HI>which has its Original from the</HI> Elements, <HI>and that is Morral. Wherefore God &s;aid,</HI> Thou &s;halt not eat the Fle&s;h with the Blood; <HI>becau&s;e the Blood is the Sen&s;itive Soul. But the Pillar of the Hou&s;e of God, is the</HI> Spirit of Life. <HI>Now after the</HI> Spirit of Life <HI>is departed, the Body becomes a Carca&s;s; therefore the Law pronounc'd the Carca&s;s Unclean, becau&s;e the</HI> Spirit of Life <HI>is de|parted from it. But among us, we reckon the Dead Body of a</HI> Chri|&s;tian <HI>to be clean, becau&s;e the Human Body was mix'd with the Blood of Divinity: be&s;ides that the Grace of</HI> Bapti&s;m <HI>departs not from it: and concerning the Carca&s;s of the</HI> Son of the Virgin, David <HI>&s;aid,</HI> They ca&s;t away their Brother as an unclean Car|ca&s;s. <HI>That is, they did not under&s;tand it to be holy; becau&s;e the</HI> Jews <HI>were his Brethren in re&s;pect of his Mother: and by their Law the Carca&s;s was reputed unclean.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be wondred, that the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines,</HI> who cannot un|der&s;tand two Natures in Chri&s;t united in one Exi&s;tence, &s;hould find out two Souls in the body of Man. And yet it is no wonder when we con&s;ider, that there are &s;ome, who imagine Three Souls in Man; whereas they might feign a great ma|ny more, &s;hould they but take every Animal Faculty for a Soul.</P>
<P>But the&s;e, and &s;uch like Conceptions admit of Excu&s;e and Interpretation, though what the vulgar believe concerning the <HI>Fabrick of the World,</HI> are altogether ab&s;urd, and not worth

Or a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Antipodes</HI> to them, with their Feet upwards, and their Heads downwards, and yet keeping a &s;teady Motion? certainly they would think, that &s;uch people would nece&s;&s;ari|ly drop into Heaven; though as to this we are not to deride their Ignorance, in regard &s;everal Holy and Grave Men have deny'd the <HI>Antipodes:</HI> neverthele&s;s, they mo&s;t idly dream that when the Sun ri&s;es and &s;ets, he goes and comes again through a certain kind of Window; but which way he gets under the Earth, they are not very &s;ollicitous about: and yet in this, they &s;eem much wi&s;er than <HI>Mahomet</HI> the great Prophet of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;el-men,</HI> who fancy'd, That the Sun went to &s;leep in a Well; <HI>Gregory</HI> was taken for a very great <HI>Philo&s;opher</HI> in his Country, for that he had made a certain Convex Model of Pa&s;tboard, like the Arch of Heaven, to the in&s;ide of which, he fa&s;tned &s;everal graines of Wheat, to repre&s;ent the Stars of the Fir&s;t Magnitude, and then turn'd the Concavity upper|mo&s;t, to &s;hew how the Heavens mov'd about the Earth, en|compas'd about by the Air.</P>
<P>As to the Liberal Arts they love <HI>Poe&s;ie</HI> above all the re&s;t, but only that which is Divine: for Prophane Ver&s;es they hate, which made <HI>Gregory</HI> extreamly wonder, that after the Wor|&s;hip of the <HI>Heathen Gods</HI> was quite taken away, and the Temples of their Gods were wholly de&s;troyed, that the Books and Ver&s;es which Treated or were Dedicated to them, were not as utterly Aboli&s;h'd. For that it was not fitting for Chri&s;tians to read the Rude and Ob&s;cene Fables of their feigned Divinities, much le&s;s to imitate them, and fetch from thence the chief Ornaments of their Poems; &s;eeing that the very Foot&s;teps of Idolatry ought to be an abomination to Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e Ver&s;es of the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> con&s;i&s;t in meer Rithmes; if we may A&s;&s;ert Con&s;onants of the &s;ame Order differing in the Vowels, to be Rithmes. For be&s;ide tho&s;e, there is no other Matter to be ob&s;erv'd: Of the&s;e they have &s;everal &s;orts, as we &s;hall teach in another Place. They are al&s;o very much delighted with ab&s;tru&s;e Sayings and Proverbs; as for Example, <HI>The Mountains of</HI> Kobol <HI>as with a burning-Gla&s;s and &s;o the prefix'd time of Man, is con&s;um'd by the pa&s;&s;ing of his days.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Dome&s;tick Oeconomie of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines:</HI> Their Marriages, Dyet, Cloathing, Habitati|ons and Burials.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Their Marriages Chri&s;tian. <HI>Polygamy</HI> lawful by the Civil Laws, not by the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical. Divorces. Nuptial Ceremonies. Benediction Sacerdotal. Their Dyet raw Beef, or half boyl'd; and Herbs half con|cocted by the Cattle. What Bread. Their way of making Butter. Their wa&s;hing their Cloathes. Their Drink. Hydromel Ale. Their Cloathing thin. Very Par&s;imonious, accu&s;tom'd to go Naked. They Curl and anoint their Hair with Butter. Mean Habitations. The Kings Palaces. Their manner of bewailing the Dead. The Funeral Pomp of their Kings.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> Marry with every one of their Wives after the Chri&s;tian manner: neither are they hin|dred by any Law of the Land from Marrying &s;everal, though they are Prohibited by their <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Penalties, as being contrary to the Sacred Canons and In|&s;titutions of the Chri&s;tians: and therefore they that Exer|ci&s;e <HI>Polygamie</HI> are not admitted to the Communion, as we have already &s;aid: For they are of that Opinion, That whatever is not prejudicial to the Publick, or to the &s;ecuri|ty and Tranquillity of private Per&s;ons is not to be Pro&s;ecuted with &s;ecular Puni&s;hment; Neither are they &s;crupulous in &s;uing out Divorces; a&s;&s;uming the &s;ame liberty to put away as to marry their Wives.</P>
<P>As for the particulars of their Nuptial Ceremonies, they are not of that importance as to Merit a Relation; nor are they the &s;ame in all Countries. Tho&s;e which <HI>Alvares</HI> re|counts, of the Nuptial Bed being brought forth and plac'd before the Doors of the Hou&s;e by Three of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and then walking round it &s;inging <HI>Hallelujas;</HI> or the cutting off the Locks of the Couple to be Wedded, for each to make an exchange, they were altogether unknown to <HI>Gre|gory;</HI> and that if it were the Cu&s;tom any where &s;o to do, it was only as he &s;aid, in &s;ome parts of <HI>Tygra:</HI> but that the <HI>Sacerdotal Benediction</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary to all Weddings he ab|&s;olutely granted.</P>
<P>Their Diet is not only very homely, but al&s;o far diffe|rent
<PB N="387" REF="184">
from ours; for they feed either upon raw Fle&s;h, or half boyl'd. <HI>Alvares</HI> gives you an Example of the Governour of <HI>Hangot, (Angot-Ras)</HI> who entertain'd <HI>Rodoric Limez</HI> at his Table with no other &s;ort of Junkets then &s;uch mean Fare, very loath&s;om to the <HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour; for in&s;tead of Sauce they bring the Gall, which plea&s;es their vitiated Pa|lates far better then Honey: but what is wor&s;e than all this, they covet as a daintie, the half Concocted Gra&s;s and green Herbs which they find in the Maws of the Bea&s;ts which they kill, and greedily devour tho&s;e mor&s;els, having fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on'd them with Pepper and Salt, as if the Bea&s;ts better under&s;tood what Herbs were mo&s;t whol&s;om then them&s;elves: a &s;ort of Dyet which none of our <HI>Europeans</HI> will envy them. Their Bread they bake upon the Embers, made in the fa&s;hion of thin Pancakes, which they call <HI>Apas.</HI></P>
<P>We have already declared, That in &s;ome of the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Territories, the People live all upon Grazing; their Flocks and Herds are their only Riches, they eat their Fle&s;h, and drink their Milk. Thus that <HI>King and no King Jacob,</HI> lurking in the rece&s;&s;es of the Rocks and Mountains, always carry'd his liv|ing Kitchen and Cellar with him, which were only three or four Goats at a time. Where the Air is temperate, they make excellent Butter and Chee&s;e; but in the violent hot Countries they want that Food, by rea&s;on that the Exce&s;&s;ive Heats hinder the Milk as well from thickning as turning. Al|&s;o their manner of Grinding is both very difficult and very laborious, for they put the Grain into a di&s;h, and rub it round about with a wodden Pe&s;tel till it be all bruis'd; afterwards they &s;ift it, and make Bread of the Flower: this is proper|ly the Maids and the Womens work, &s;o that you cannot com|pel the Servants to this &s;ort of Labour: but the Men wa&s;h their leathern, or woollen Clothes if they have any them|&s;elves, for Linnen is very &s;carce; and indeed the general Co|verings of their Nakedne&s;s, are the Skins of their own Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Their Drink is &s;omewhat more dainty, and is the Glory and Con&s;ummation of all their Fea&s;ts; for &s;o far they &s;till retain the Cu&s;tom of many of the Ancients, that as &s;oon as the Table is clear'd, they fall to drinking; having always this Proverb in their mouths, <HI>That it is the u&s;ual way to Plant fir&s;t, and then to Water:</HI> they drink them&s;elves up to a merry Pitch, and till their Tongues run before their Wit, and never give off till the Drink be all out. They make excellent <HI>Hydro|mel</HI>
<PB N="388" REF="185">
by rea&s;on of their plenty of Honey, which inebriates like Wine, they call it <HI>Tzed;</HI> they make it &s;maller for their Fa|milies, mixing &s;ix parts of Wine, with one of Water. Ano|ther &s;ort of Liquor they have of their Fruits; whether an Invention of their own, or that they learnt it from the <HI>Aegyp|tians,</HI> they call it <HI>Tzal;</HI> and it may be &s;aid to be a kind of Ale rather than Beer; as being boyl'd without Hopps, and there|fore it will not keep: it is white, and &s;weet, in&s;omuch that our Ale was much more bitter to <HI>Gregories</HI> ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Their Apparel is no le&s;s mean and poor, only the Princes wear Silk; the Clergy and richer &s;ort make u&s;e of Cotton: the poorer &s;ort half-naked, cover them&s;elves with Skins, that hardly hide their privy Parts; which is al&s;o common among &s;ome of the Nobility and Prie&s;thood: which by the <HI>Europeans</HI> would be lookt upon as a great Scandal, to appear in the Church or the Chancel without Breeches. However the more noble &s;ort wear a kind of Breeches, or rather Trou|&s;es down to their heels, yet with &s;uch a frugality, that the King is not a&s;ham'd of; for from the Wa&s;te to the Knees, &s;o far as the cloak covers them, they are only Linnen or el&s;e of &s;ome cour&s;er &s;tuff, and only that which appears below is of Silk: nor are they concern'd though the other be &s;een as they &s;it, or Mount their Hor&s;es. The Boys and Girls go &s;tark Na|ked, which the heat of the Country may excu&s;e, yet Pover|ty is the main occa&s;ion; till riper Years calls upon them to hide their Shame; yet then having been &s;o accu&s;tomed to go Naked, they the le&s;s regard it. But what they want in de|cent Habit, they endeavour to &s;upply in the Ornament of their Hair, for you may &s;afely &s;ay, it is a full year before they Trim and Comb them&s;elves. They not only curl their Hair which makes it grow the &s;treighter, but al&s;o anoint it, not with fragrant Bal&s;oms, or Oyles of Amber or Musk, but with Butter; not con&s;idering that they who are forc'd to turn their No&s;es from the &s;tench of their Locks, have not the opportu|nity to admire the lu&s;tre of their Matted Tre&s;&s;es: yet le&s;t an Ornament &s;o &s;lick and glittering &s;hould be rumpl'd or &s;queez'd in the Night, they by means of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite In|vention pre&s;erve it, re&s;ting their Necks in a forked &s;tick, that &s;o their Heads may hang at liberty, preferring their Pride be|fore Pain and Torture.</P>
<P>Nor does their Poverty le&s;s appear in their Hou&s;es, for they that belong to the Camp, live all either in Tents, or in
<PB N="389" REF="185">
Hurts made up of Reeds and Rubbi&s;h, daub'd over with Clay or Lome, and cover'd with Straw or Sedge, which they leave behind them when they remove their Camp with no dammage, or condoling for the lo&s;s of their Tenement, when they can as ea&s;ily build another at the &s;ame rate.

The <HI>Cafers</HI> like Wild Bea&s;ts lye with|out any other Curtains or Canopie than that of Heaven, in the open Field, where Night con&s;trains them to re&s;t. The Kings Hou&s;es are of two Fa&s;hions, the Longer which are call'd <HI>Sakala;</HI> and the Rounder, which if they be bigger then ordi|nary, are call'd <HI>Beta Negus,</HI> tho Kings Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>They bewail their Dead after a mo&s;t doleful manner; for no &s;ooner do they hear of the Death of any great Per&s;o|nage, or any near Friend, but they pro&s;trate them&s;elves upon the Ground, where they lye knocking and brui&s;ing their Heads again&s;t it, with a cruelty very injurious to their Sculls. The Funeral of <HI>Su&s;neus</HI> as being mo&s;t Remarkable, I &s;hall here &s;et down, to &s;hew their &s;olemnities in burying their Kings. The Body, being wrapt up and covered with a mo&s;t rich and co&s;t|ly Garment, was carryed from <HI>Dancaza,</HI> where the Camp then lay, to the Church call'd <HI>Ganeta&mdash;Je&s;us.</HI> Before the Hear&s;e the Banners and En&s;ignes were born, not Revers'd, as among us, but upright and di&s;play'd, without any <HI>Impre&s;es</HI> or <HI>Motto's,</HI> but only adorn'd with various Colours: the Drums beat &s;low and mournfully: after them followed Three of the be&s;t Hor&s;es which the King us'd to Ride, Magnificently capari|&s;on'd, as if it had been for &s;ome Triumphal Pomp: next to them follow'd &s;everal of the Noblemens Sons, carrying the Kings Royal Robes, and En&s;igns of Regality, as his Di|adem, his Sword, his Belt, his Spear, his Buckler, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> taking their turns, and by their ge&s;tures and po&s;tures u&s;ing all means to excite the People to Tears and Lamentation. To the &s;ame End the Queen her &s;elf, following at a good di&s;tance wore upon her Head her Husbands particular Diadem; ac|companied with her Daughters and all the Ladies and Vir|gins of Noble Extraction, all riding upon <HI>Mules,</HI> and having their Tre&s;&s;es cut off: after them followed the Kings Son and Succe&s;&s;or, with his Brothers and all the Nobility, &s;ome on Hor&s;eback, and &s;ome on Foot, in old tatter'd Habits, in&s;tead of Mourning: no Torches or <HI>Flambeaus</HI> lighted them along in their Proce&s;&s;ion: no Tapers burning in the Church, nor

was any thing to be heard from one end to the other of it, but Groans and Lamentations, till the Body was laid in the Tomb: only &s;ome few <HI>Monks</HI> &s;tanding before the Doors of the Church, read &s;ome few of the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> of <HI>David.</HI> Next day they return'd to <HI>Dancaza;</HI> and then &s;o &s;oon as they came in &s;ight of the place, another &s;ort of Pomp was order'd. For the Hear&s;e being brought back again empty, was carry'd fir&s;t, by which rode a certain Hor&s;eman, adorn'd with the Emperours Habit and Robes; and before him rode another upon a Hor&s;e richly capari&s;on'd, and arm'd with Helmet and Spear: in which manner after they had proceeded a little way, &s;ome certain Bands of Armed Soldiers March'd forth of the Camp to meet them, te&s;tifying their Sorrow, by their bitter Lamen|tations and Howlings. Then the Princes of the Kingdome and chiefe&s;t Lords of the Court entring the new Kings Pavil|lion, renewed their Moans with all expre&s;&s;ions of Sorrow, and concluded the Solemnity at length, with congratulations and well-wi&s;hes for his happy Government, and pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s in all his undertakings.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of their Mechanic Arts and Trades.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Very few Handicrafts. The <HI>Jews</HI> Weavers and Smiths. No Societies of Trades-men. Certain Families of Trumpeters. Architecture formerly known, now forgotten; compar'd with the Ancient <HI>Germans.</HI> Churches and Colledges built by the Fathers of the Societie. The Kings <HI>Palace</HI> Built after the <HI>European</HI> manner, admir'd. They are covetous of Learn|ing and Sciences. What the King of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> chiefly wants.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ALL this while, there is nothing of which they &s;tand more in need then of Handicraft Trades: for there|by they are de&s;titute of &s;o many conveniencies of Hu|man Life, as we abound in by the help of our Arts and Sci|ences. The <HI>Jews</HI> are almo&s;t the only per&s;ons that employ them&s;elves among them in weaving of Cotton: they al&s;o make the Heads of their Spears and &s;everal other pieces of Workman&s;hip in Iron, for they are excellent Smiths; a &s;ort of Trade otherwi&s;e abhorr'd by the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines;</HI> which <HI>Gregory</HI> confirm'd with a &s;mile; &s;aying, That the &s;illy vulgar peo|ple could not endure Smiths, <HI>as being a &s;ort of Mortals that
<PB N="391" REF="186">
&s;pit fire, and were bred up in Hell.</HI> As for other things, every one takes Care to &s;upply his own wants either by his own or the pains of his Servants, which it is no hard matter to do; con&s;idering how little they have to u&s;e. And for the great Men, they have particular men for all their particular Em|ployments: therefore there are no <HI>Guilds,</HI> or Fraternities of Trades-men among them, which are &s;o frequent in all our Cities, who have their By-laws contriv'd by them&s;elves, more for the good of them&s;elves, than for the benefit of the Commonweale: for among&s;t us, the skilful and unskil|full, the ju&s;t dealer and unju&s;t, are all alike; as be|ing all under the &s;ame By-laws; and they exerci&s;e a kind of Monopolie of their Trade, &s;o that their fellow Citizens are as it were Forraigners among them, and compell'd to obey their Injunctions. But in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> what ever Art any one Profe&s;&s;es, that he teaches his Children. The <HI>Trumpeters</HI> and <HI>Horn-winders</HI> are all of the &s;ame Families, and have their particular Country and Man&s;ions by them&s;elves. Formerly <HI>Architecture,</HI> as it was in reque&s;t, &s;o it was an Art well known among them, as is evident by the Ruines of the City of <HI>Axuma,</HI> and the Structures of Magnificent Temples cut out of the Live Stone Rocks: but the Imperial Seat being removed into <HI>Amhara,</HI> it grew out of date. For the Kings having de&s;erted <HI>Axuma,</HI> by rea&s;on of their long and frequent Marches being accu&s;tomed to their Camps, rather cho&s;e to abide in Tents and Pavillions. Be&s;ides that, after the havocks of the <HI>Adelan</HI> Wars, and the Inva&s;ions of the <HI>Gallans,</HI> found that the <HI>Ca|verns</HI> and <HI>Rece&s;&s;es</HI> of their Inacce&s;&s;ible Mountains were far more &s;afe and convenient and better &s;helter then &s;umptuous Palaces. Therefore what <HI>Tacitus</HI> hath written concerning our Ancient <HI>Germans,</HI> may be rightly apply'd to the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines. It is &s;ufficiently known, that Cities are not inhabited by any of the</HI> Habe&s;&s;ine <HI>People, neither do they permit contiguous Buildings among them. They place their Villages not as we do, building our Hou&s;es clo&s;e one to another; but every one encompa&s;&s;es to him&s;elf a &s;pace of ground peculiar to his Habitation, whether to prevent the accidents of Fire, or whether it be their ignorance in the Art of Building. They neither u&s;e Cement or Tiles, the whole compo&s;ure of their Fa|bricks, being all of rude and Cour&s;e Materials, without the lea&s;t ap|pearance of Elegancy or Ornament.</HI></P>
<P>But the Fathers of the Societies, having de&s;ign'd their <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> Structures before, carry'd an <HI>Architect</HI> with them out of
<PB N="392" REF="187">
<HI>India,</HI> and having found out Lime, unknown to the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> for &s;o many Ages, built their Churches and their Colledges of Stone and Mortar, and encompa&s;s'd them with High-walls, to the amazement and dread of the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines,</HI> le&s;t they &s;hould in time be made &s;o many Impregnable Forts and Ca&s;tles. But there was nothing which they &s;o much admir'd as the Palace which they built for the King; of which the chief Architect was <HI>Peter Pays,</HI> both Labourer and Work-ma&s;ter, both Surveyer, Carpenter, and Ma&s;on him&s;elf, and In|&s;tructor of others. A Work which afterwards the People from all parts of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> far and near flock't to &s;ee. How|ever that the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> have a great de&s;ire to learn all tho&s;e Arts and Sciences which are nece&s;&s;ary both in Peace and War, is apparent by King <HI>David</HI>'s Letter to <HI>John</HI> the Third King of <HI>Portugal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Alvar.</HI> Tom. 2.

<P>Pilgrimages now rare. They Travel upon Mules. No Inns or Wagons. Their Ho&s;pitality. The way into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> dangerous. An account of the &s;everal ways to it.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HOwever in the mid&s;t of all this penury of <HI>Exotic</HI> Arts and Conveniencies, the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> of their own ac|cord never care to &s;tir out of their Native Coun|try, as being ignorant of Forraign Languages and Regions; nor can they di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>European</HI> Nations, which they believe to be all <HI>Franks,</HI> and their Religion the <HI>Latine Wor&s;hip;</HI> only they can tell the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer|chants. Neither do they under&s;tand the way of Exchange,
<PB N="393" REF="187">
or keeping Corre&s;pondence: Be&s;ides, they are deterr'd by their own Poverty from undertaking &s;uch dangerous Jour|neys through &s;o many uncouth De&s;erts.</P>
<P>Formerly indeed they frequently made their holy Pilgri|mages to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and &s;o back again to <HI>Rome,</HI> when the <HI>Mamalucks</HI> were Lords of <HI>Egypt;</HI> their Government being more gentle, and the ways then far le&s;s dangerous then after|wards: but the Covetou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Turks</HI> has quite alter'd the Ca&s;e, for the Ba&s;ha's and Governours of the I&s;lands of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and the upper <HI>Egypt,</HI> Men for the mo&s;t part of ba&s;e and &s;ordid Condition, having bought their Employments at Court with Mony, without any &s;en&s;e of Law or Equity, &s;o torment and vex all &s;orts of Travellers, and &s;uck the Mer|chants Pur&s;es in &s;uch manner, though to the utter impove|ri&s;hing the Subject and utter decay of Trade, have ruin'd all Commerce and Society with tho&s;e Places: &s;o that the <HI>Ha|be&s;&s;ines</HI> now very rarely vi&s;it <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and more rarely go to abide there, as they were wont. For though there, they are &s;omewhat more free from the exactions of the Church, yet are they more oppre&s;s'd by want; in regard that the Re|venues &s;ettled by the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> Kings upon Pilgrims in tho&s;e Parts, are in the hands of the <HI>Turks;</HI> &s;o that unle&s;s the Alms of the Place which are very &s;paring, God knows, &s;upport them, hunger pre&s;ently de&s;troys them.</P>
<P>In their Travelling, they only make u&s;e of Mules; neither can any other Creature perform that kindne&s;s to Man as they do, over &s;o many craggie Rocks and Mountains, where it is impo&s;&s;ible for Waggons, Carts, or Coaches to pa&s;s. Their Hor&s;es they pre&s;erve very charily for War, and Racing. <HI>Gre|gory</HI> wondred when he &s;aw our cover'd Wains: He call'd that wherein He and I travell'd together <HI>Bet,</HI> a Hou&s;e, and wi&s;h'd he had &s;uch a one to carry him into <HI>Ethiopia.</HI> The Great Men and richer &s;ort, carry all their Dome&s;tick Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff along with them upon their Mules; and where Night over-takes 'em, there they pitch their Tents, and kindle Fires about them to skare the Wild Bea&s;ts. The poorer &s;ort; when they have occa&s;ion to Travel beg upon the Rode; for there is not an Inn to be &s;een among them; and for Cooks Shops and Ordinaries, they know as little what belongs to them. Upon which happen'd a plea&s;ant accident at <HI>Rome.</HI> Where the &s;imple <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> newly arriv'd out of the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> being walking in the <HI>Suburbs,</HI> were invited by a Cook into
<PB N="394" REF="188">
his Shop. They believing all Invitations to be made <HI>gratis,</HI> at fir&s;t admir'd the Ho&s;pitallity of the Man; but then con&s;ider|ing, that it might be done out of Curio&s;ity, to &s;ee and di&s;cour&s;e with &s;trangers, went into the Shop, and very chearfully ac|cepted of what was &s;et before them: but at length, when they were going away, they con&s;ulted together for Phra&s;e and Language to return their thanks to &s;o kind an Ho&s;t for his liberal Entertainment, which one among the re&s;t, who be&s;t under&s;tood the Language was to deliver to the Cook in the behalf of his Companions. The Cook having li&s;ten'd a while to their Learned Speech, and not hearing a word of any Mony, without any re&s;pect to the &s;moothne&s;s of their Language, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who pays?</HI> The <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> like Men A&s;toni&s;h'd made an&s;wer, <HI>That they came not into his Shop of their own accord, but by his Invitation, without any mention made of Expectancy of Payment; and that he, when he &s;et his Wine and his Meat before them, never bargain'd for any Money, for that was the very thing they wanted.</HI> But all this would not &s;atisfie the Cook, who forc'd them to leave their Cloaks in Pawn, which were afterwards redeem'd at the <HI>Popes</HI> Charity, which made the Courtiers not a little Merry.</P>
<P>However the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> them&s;elves are not ignorant of Ho&s;pitality, for that in their Villages they appoint the Chief|e&s;t of the Inhabitants for the Relief of the Poor: and in|deed the Exerci&s;e of Ho&s;pitallity is highly recommended by the <HI>Apo&s;tolical Doctrine,</HI> for the Relief of poor People driven from their abodes by the misfortunes of War, or other Ca|lamities. Nor were our Ance&s;tors defective in their Chri&s;ti|an Charity, as having founded &s;everal Magnificent Pallaces, and endowed them with ample Revenues, were they but employ'd according to the Founders De&s;ign.</P>
<P>And here it may be very proper to &s;et down the &s;everal ways that lead into <HI>Ethiopia</HI> by Land, and where they that go by Sea are to put in for a Landing Place.</P>
<P>The way from <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia</HI> is mo&s;t trouble&s;ome, difficult, and &s;ubject to many dangers, as well by rea&s;on of the Extortions of the <HI>Turks,</HI> the Robberies committed by &s;everal vagabond Nations, through which they are to pa&s;s, and the unwhole&s;omne&s;s of the Climates; though formerly when tho&s;e Kingdoms and Satrapies were under a &s;tricter Government, the Pa&s;&s;age was &s;afe enough, and more frequen|ted.

<PB N="396" REF="189">
where they take Shipping for <HI>Gidda,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Suaqena,</HI> &amp;c. This way the Metropolitans u&s;e to take, as did <HI>Abdelme&s;ih</HI> in the Year 1662. with whom it is the &s;afe&s;t Travelling, if any of the <HI>Europeans</HI> are de&s;irous to vi&s;it <HI>Aba&s;&s;ia. Michael,</HI> the <HI>Ha|be&s;&s;inian</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour to the Emperour of the <HI>Turks,</HI> told <HI>Thevenot,</HI> That a Man may reach from <HI>Guendra</HI> to the I&s;land of <HI>Suaqena</HI> in a Fortnight; and from hence, in forty or fifty days to <HI>Grand Cairo</HI> by Land. So that to Travel from the <HI>Royal Camp</HI> to <HI>Grand Cairo,</HI> will take up three Months. There is another way by Sea, round about <HI>Africa;</HI> but then you put in to &s;ome Port of <HI>Africa,</HI> that &s;o you may take your op|portunity to get into the <HI>Per&s;ian Gulph:</HI> Many would prefer this way as mo&s;t facile, tho tedious and trouble&s;om had the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines</HI> any Sea Port at their Command. They that have bu&s;ine&s;s at <HI>Moccha</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> have the advantage of cro&s;&s;ing over to <HI>Matzua</HI> that lyes over again&s;t it; and &s;o from <HI>Arkiko</HI> the Pa&s;&s;age lies ea&s;ie: nor do they ami&s;s that make for <HI>Baylur</HI> a Sea Port belonging to the King of <HI>Denkala,</HI> in Amity with the <HI>Habe&s;&s;ines;</HI> only the Journey by Land from thence is tedi|ous and very much infe&s;ted by the Robberies of the <HI>Gallans;</HI> though they that can Travel with a good Band of Mu&s;que|teers need little fear them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Of the Merchandize, and Exchange of Merchan|dize in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> chiefly, next the <HI>Armenians</HI> the chief Merchants; all bargains by Exchange, of Gold, Iron, Salt. What Goods Exported, what Imported.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom what hath been &s;aid, it appears that the <HI>Ethiopi|ans</HI> are no way addicted or expert in the Art and In|treagues of Merchandizing; for they that will not Travel into Forraign Parts mu&s;t yield their gains to others; for gain is to be &s;ought, not coming of it &s;elf. Therefore the <HI>Arabians</HI> who Inhabit the Ports of the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> e&s;pe|cially, the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> &s;cattered over the Kingdom, are the Chief Merchants in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> for being of the &s;ame Reli|gion they have the free liberty of all the Ports of the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> next to the&s;e the <HI>Armenians,</HI> not much differing in their Form of Wor&s;hip, from the <HI>Abe&s;&s;ines,</HI> carry the greate&s;t Trade, as be|ing great Dealers in all parts of the World. They Import &s;undry &s;orts of Commodities, but carry out all the Gold; that 'tis no wonder the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> &s;hould be &s;o poor: for neither Gold nor Silver is imported into their Country, but only an Exchange is made for <HI>Indian</HI> Wares. And then be|cau&s;e there is no Money coin'd in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the more &s;illy and ignorant &s;ort of People, becau&s;e they come ea&s;ily by their Gold, as finding it among the Sand, or at the Roots of Trees, let it go again at low Rates. For if the Merchant de|ny it to be good, they exchange it for as much as they can get, never que&s;tioning the Merchants exception. But the Nobility and more cunning &s;ort, carry a Touch-&s;tone always about 'em, with which they try their Gold, then weigh it out, and pay it by the Ounce. The <HI>Ethiopic Vaket,</HI> or Ounce amounts, as <HI>Gregory</HI> told me, to the value of the <HI>Spani&s;h Patacoon,</HI> or our Imperial <HI>Dollar:</HI> Therefore it is, that Exchange is far more frequent in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> then buying and &s;elling; which Ex|change is made with Iron &s;ometimes, but chiefly for Salt hewn out of the Mountains; which in mo&s;t Countrys &s;upplies the Place of Mony, with which you may purcha&s;e all things. In the more remote Parts of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> you may buy a good
<PB N="398" REF="190">
<HI>Mule</HI> with two or three Bricks of that Salt. Formerly Pepper had the &s;ame pre-eminence.</P>
<P>The Commodities Imported, are <HI>Babylonian</HI> Garments of all &s;orts, Velvet, Silken; but chiefly Woollen and Fu&s;tian, which the great Men wear in&s;tead of Purple, which at this day they have lo&s;t the skill of Dying. Spices, and e&s;pecially Pepper they covet to &s;ea&s;on their in&s;ipid Dyet. Wares for Exportation they have few, be&s;ides Gold, Skins, Hides, Wax, Honey, and Ivory: &s;carce any thing el&s;e remarkable. Many more they certainly might have, did the <HI>Habe&s;&s;inian</HI> Kings encourage Traffick and Merchandizing, and if the Country were more commodious for Carriage. The be&s;t Merchan|dize in <HI>Habe&s;&s;inia,</HI> and mo&s;t important for the Prince, were a more cultivated Ingenuity of the People; together with a perfect knowledge of the Latine Language, together with addition of our Arts, and Handicraft Trades, which would advance the Affairs of tho&s;e poor Chri&s;tians to a more flou|ri&s;hing E&s;tate, and weaken the &s;trength of the <HI>Barbarians.</HI></P>
<P>The Almighty God &s;tir up the Hearts of our Princes, to lend their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to this Ancient Chri&s;tian Nation, which might prove &s;o u&s;eful to Propagate Chri&s;tianity in tho&s;e Re|mote Parts of the World; and &s;o glorious to them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity.</P>
