<HEAD>THE CONTINVATI|ON OF OVR WEEKLY newes out of <HI>Italy, Hungary, Bohemia, Silesia, Austria,</HI> the <HI>Pallatinate, Eischvelt, Westpha|lia,</HI> the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> and other pla|ces of the vpper and lower Germanie.</HEAD>
<P>_COnditions of composi|tion hauing bene offered vnto <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> by the Emperour, and for ought we yet heare refu|sed (as wee told you in our last printed, Iuly 22) The Emperour being now at last, either much wearied, or more weak|ned with the warres, seemes of late times to be rather willing to require a peace, then at leasure to expect, (as aforetimes) the mediation of great Princes vnto him to grant it. So that there were the last yeere scarce more Ambassadours retaining vpon him at <HI>Vienna,</HI> then he hath of late sent abroad vpon his owne em|ployments. Witnesse those messages of his; vnto the States of <HI>Hungary,</HI> to perswade with them for their constancy; vnto the Great <HI>Turke,</HI> for the conseruing
<PB N="2" REF="3">
of the peace, concluded for twentie yeares with the former Emperor <HI>Rodulphus</HI>; vnto the Duke of <HI>Saexo|nie,</HI> to know whither he were to expect him a friend, foe, or Neutrall; vnto the Princes of the lower <HI>Sax|onie,</HI> to desire passage for <HI>Tilly,</HI> and deniall of passage to <HI>Brunswick:</HI> and lastly vnto <HI>Brunswick</HI> himselfe, with a second pardon, and vnto <HI>Mansfield,</HI> (as it is thought) with some promises of much preferment: Of all which we shall speake as we haue occasion.</P>
<P>The Emperors present and most apparent hopes, seem to depend vpon Monsieur <HI>Tilly,</HI> and his greatest feares in <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI>; who hauing of late reassumed the Title of King elect of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> which he is said to haue stamped vpon his Coyne, and to haue besides his owne preparations of <HI>Hungars</HI> and <HI>Walachians,</HI> which he hath mustered, and with them aduanced forwards, and sent the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> vnto <HI>Cani|sia,</HI> and the Borders of the Empire, (which they are feared to be ready to enter, so soone as Haruest is off the ground,) hee is further beleeued to haue agreed with the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> in another place, that they for the diuersion of the King of <HI>Polands</HI> ayd, promised by him vnto his Brother in Law the Em|perour, and fall vpon his Lands of <HI>Podolia</HI>; which as they haue often this yeare heretofore made in|rodes vpon, so now are they said in most huge multi|tudes, (their feares in <HI>Silesia</HI> makes them report, that there are 200000 of them) to be vpon falling in once againe vpon it. Besides all which, <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> is thought to correspond with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who vpon the expiration of the truce betwixt him and <HI>Poland,</HI> is said to haue a braue Army in a readi|nesse,
<PB N="3" REF="3">
for the raising of the siege of <HI>Riga,</HI> which tis said that the young Prince of <HI>Poland</HI> is to besiege presently with 20000 men. <HI>Sweden</HI> is also said to haue a faire Fleet, with 23 shippes, of which as some Shippers of <HI>Amsterdam</HI> that loosed from <HI>Dant|zick,</HI> Iune 29, and Iuly 1, relate; That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and his sonne being then to be entertained by the <HI>Dantzickers</HI> in their Towne; that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> lay before the Riuer about <HI>Dantzick,</HI> with 23 shippes, or as others say, with 28: many of which were furnished with 28 faire cast pieces of Brasse, (there being a report also, that his Maiestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> himselfe in person, was aboord one of them) which fleet haling all ships that past that way for the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>; did strictly and seuerally exa|mine all the Shippers they could meet with, and ar|rested the ships of <HI>Poland:</HI> they of the Fleet of <HI>Swe|den</HI> also reported, that their King had an Army in a readinesse for the defence of the Country of <HI>Litua|nia,</HI> which of late daies he tooke from the Crowne of <HI>Poland.</HI> Thus write the Letters from <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> Iuly 17.</P>
<P>Lastly, is <HI>Bethlem Gabor</HI> affirmed, to maintaine neere intelligence with <HI>Brunswick</HI> and <HI>Mansfield,</HI> that so the Emperour might haue worke enough on all sides: and whosoeuer (finally) being discontented with the Emperour, and repaires to him, he enter|taines; as accounting them to be friends sure enough to him, and foes eager enough against the Emperor, whom their owne priuate interest makes to be so.</P>
<P>For preuention of all which, the Emperor is said to haue sometimes conceiued a very good hope, that
<PB N="4" REF="4">
by a speedy strengthning of Monsieur <HI>Tilly,</HI> he should either by treatie or victory conclude time enough with <HI>Brunswick</HI> to employ <HI>Tilly</HI> aboue in <HI>Bohemia</HI> or <HI>Silesia,</HI> which hath beene most of the reason, that those <HI>Cosacks</HI> which himselfe meant for defence of those Countries, were by himselfe threatned vnto both the circuits of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> to be ready to be sent vnto the aid of <HI>Tilly</HI>; and that his Camp in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> for which a place had beene laid out about <HI>Conings|graets,</HI> is since that thought fitter to be formed about <HI>Egra.</HI> For which purpose the Collonell <HI>Walsterp</HI> was about the end of Iune, come from <HI>Coningsgraets</HI> to <HI>Prage,</HI> with Commission from the Emperour to doe it. Who was thereupon to haue some better place it seemes, for his owne Regiment being mustered and paid, hee was to leaue to bee commanded by the Count of <HI>de Nagrat,</HI> whose Lieutenant Colonell, one <HI>Merote</HI> was to be. About which businesse also the <HI>Landtgraue</HI> of <HI>Lichtensteyne,</HI> Lord Deputie of <HI>Bohe|mia,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Swartzenberg,</HI> were instantly to repaire vnto <HI>Prage,</HI> to consult vpon that, and vpon the message of the Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> and the Bishop of <HI>Wurtzberg,</HI> who had then sent to <HI>Prage</HI> for all the ayd that could be spared out of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> to be forth|with sent downe to Monsieur <HI>Tilly,</HI> who expected no other but to be put to it to fight presently. But the Count of <HI>Swartzenbergh</HI> hauing diuers aduices and Letters of the Emperour about him, is said to haue beene killed in the way (by some that lay for the pur|pose) and his packets and intelligence taken away, which will bring forth a new discouery. This Count of <HI>Swartzenbergh,</HI> which is thus said to be killed, is
<PB N="5" REF="4">
the very same Gentleman who was the last yeare that great Ambassadour from the Emperour, being heere in London feasted and entertained.</P>
<P>As for the two aides of <HI>Cosacks,</HI> those 4000 which came to offer their seruice to the Emperour, they lie yet in <HI>Morauia</HI> about <HI>Brin</HI> and <HI>Iglaw</HI>; where hauing done much hurt, they are now said to keepe better discipline, since that the countrey of <HI>Austria</HI> hath beene enforced to contribute towards their vi|ctuals, and that they haue beene receiued into the pay of the Bishop of <HI>Neus,</HI> who is the Arch-Duke <HI>Charles,</HI> brother to the Emperor. But for those other 12000 which lay aboue, betweene the Fron|tiers of <HI>Poland, Brandenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Silesia</HI>; their be|hauiour was so good, that the Silesians raised 10000 men to withstand their passage; which they offering to force, the Silesians killed diuers of the <HI>Cosacks</HI>; the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> likewise, and the Duke of <HI>Pomeren,</HI> haue commanded their subiects from man to man, to make vp towards the <HI>Cosacks</HI> quar|ters; and if they shall offer to forage or burne the Villages, as they haue done, to cut the throats of them.</P>
<P>And this is the truth of the Emperors warlike and apparent preparations for resisting of <HI>Bethlem Ga|bor.</HI> The State of Hungary is distracted and hath not as yet agreed vpon the choice of their Pallatine for this yeere: The Campe in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> is for sus|picion of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> making vpwards, drawne downe to <HI>Egra</HI> further from Hungary, and neerer to <HI>Brunswick</HI>; (as being in the very confines of <HI>Bo|hemia,</HI> next to the Dominions of Bauaria and Saxo|ny,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and close vpon the vpper Pallatinate;) much of which Army is also (for the time) to be diuided, by sending aid out of it to <HI>Monsieur Tilly</HI>; and for the Auxiliarie <HI>Cosacks,</HI> you see in what distresse they are themselues. Here are the helps, that the Silesians haue now 10000 men (which whether they pur|pose or shall be able to continue in the Emperours seruice, or whether they gathered them onely vpon this occasion to withstand the Cosacks, we cannot tell.) And for supply of money, there is a new Impo|sition, and that a greater one, laid vpon <HI>Morauia</HI> and <HI>Silesia,</HI> (as for <HI>Lusatia</HI> which should contribute with them, it is you heare sequestred into the hands of the Duke of <HI>Saxony.</HI> They of <HI>Silesia</HI> being to pay fiue florins a month, for euery Citizen, and euery Coun|trey man or Boer two and a halfe. The confis|cated goods of the Protestants in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and those parts may yeeld some addition of treasure; which businesse goes now forward very earnestly; And that course which is taken with the Iewes both at <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Prague,</HI> is likely to bring in a fairer Entrato and a good round summe. For the Iewes are in the end of Iune, in both these cities warned, either to turne to the Catholike Religion; or else out of hand to pay so much moneys for the entertainment of the Empe|rours Armies, and in case they refuse to doe either, they are commanded presently to auoid the land, this is written from <HI>Vienna</HI> Iune 28, &amp; 29. And thus haue Christian Princes, still in their necessitie saued them|selues vpon the Iewes from time to time.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5">Now for the countenancing of Monseur <HI>Tilly,</HI> the Emperour hath of late taken diuers courses: As Iune 23. he sent a Poste vnto the lower Creitz of <HI>Saxony,</HI> once more to require a finall resolution of them, whether they were purposed to grant passage vnto his enemies through their Countries or not, (meaning Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> army) which if they purposed to doe, he then threatned them with the sending downe of the Cossackes towards the ayd of Monseur <HI>Tilly.</HI> And for this answer he propoun|ded them eight dayes, that is, by the eight of Iuly, as they write from <HI>Vienna</HI> Iune 29. The same message was also sent to the Elector the Duke of the vpper <HI>Saxony,</HI> of whom he further requires to be certified, whether by his army which hee hath now gotten to|gether, he now meanes peace or warre towards him. Vnto other States of the Empire, who haue hitherto shewed themselues for him, hath he sent other mes|sengers, to desire the continuance of their constan|cie, and that they would by no meanes be drawne in to side against him with any other League, but eue|ry way to oppose his enemies.</P>
<P>And Iune 27. there passed an Imperiall Poste through <HI>Prage,</HI> with Letters towards Count <HI>Mans|field</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> to draw them off, with offer of pardon and new promises. But the suc|cesse of the Letters may well be iudged, by the time of their deliuery, which fell out to be iust at the time when both <HI>Mansfield</HI> and <HI>Brunswicke</HI> were newly ri|sen with their armies. Of the sending of these Let|ters they write from <HI>Prage</HI> Iune 29. And that it may not seeme strange or cheape, that the Emperour
<PB N="8" REF="6">
would vouchsafe to send another pardon vnto the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> who had so lately refused the former: this is said to be the reason, namely, that the old Duchesse of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> Duke <HI>Christians</HI> mother, hauing perswaded her selfe that she should in time preuaile with her Sonne to accept it, had already as|sured the Emperour, that hee had accepted of it: whereupon the new pardon was drawne, signed, and sent: which being deliuered to the Duke in the Camp, without the knowledge of any such vnder|taking of his mother in his behalfe, he first receiued and read so farre, till perceiuing what it was, he with his owne hands is said to haue cancelled, as hee had done the former. To make this pardon (it seemes) to take the sooner, Monseur <HI>Tilly</HI> had Commission likewise to demand of Duke <HI>Christian</HI> the reason of his aduancing forwards with such an Army, and re|quired in the name of his Imperiall Maiesty his di|rect answer within eight dayes, whether it were for the Emperour or against him.</P>
<P>About which time (but whether vpon confidence of the former vndertaking of the old Duchesse or no, we know not, or vpon hope that the Princes of the Lower Creitz of <HI>Saxony</HI> durst not deny the Empe|rour any thing) Monseur <HI>Tilly</HI> was bold, by directi|ons from the Emperour, to require passage of Duke <HI>Vlrick</HI> (the present gouerning Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> Duke <HI>Christians</HI> elder Brother) for his Army to passe through his Countries, whereof we haue here giuen you the true Copies.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<HEAD>To the Lord <HI>Fredericke Vlrick,</HI> Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> Illustrious high-borne Prince and Gratious Lord.</HEAD>
<P>I Cannot forbeare in most humble manner to cer|tifie your Princely Grace, that there is great ap|pearance, how your Highnes Brother the Duke <HI>Christian,</HI> will easily giue mee occasion to seeke pas|sage with my whole Army, through your Lordships Dominions. In which case, I must humbly entreat that of your good Grace you would not take it ill, If I seeke passage that way. But for the more securitie of this Army, and that his Imperiall Maiesties For|ces may not be stopped, hindred or molested in their passage, (but rather supplyed with victualls and all other necessaries for an Army, that they may keepe ciuill and military Discipline the better, and haue cause to fauour your Highnes Subiects the more) I desire your Lordship gratiously to appoint such Of|ficers of your owne, in all places, as may prouide vs of such conuenient necessaries as we moderately de|mand, or otherwise (without prescribing me or li|miting the manner or proportion) to send one or two Commissaries, which may continually attend our Army for the seruice aboue required: I am con|fident in this particular, that according to your for|mer sinceritie euer showne towards his Imperiall Maiesty, you will be carefull to prouide herein to sa|tisfie our expectation.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="7">But if it shall otherwise fall out, that any annoy|ance or inconuenience should in our passage light vpon any of your Subiects, (which I could most wil|lingly desire might by a good and timely order, by you to bee giuen, bee by all meanes preuented and eschewed) your Excellency shall not haue cause to impute these disturbances vnto me: for which rea|son I would not omit to giue you timely notice by these my Letters. And thus humbly taking my leaue, I commend me with all submission vnto your prince|ly Excellency.</P>

<P>These Letters of the Generall, being receiued, read, wondred at, and considered vpon, an answer as sudden as the cause required, was forthwith re|turned to the <HI>Bauarian</HI> Campe. The Dukes Let|ters bearing this Superscription, which is Monseur <HI>Tillies</HI> style:</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<HEAD>To <HI>Iohn</HI> Count <HI>Thordas</HI> of <HI>Tilly,</HI> Ba|ron of <HI>Worbiese, Valester,</HI> and <HI>Wantigen,</HI> Generall of the Emperour.</HEAD>
<P>The Dukes Letters were signed on the top, Fredericke Vlrick.</P>
<P>OVr fauour and good will prefixed. (High|borne and especially beloued) your Letters dated at <HI>Eschwegen</HI> the 19. of Iune, <HI>Stylo novo,</HI> were yesterday deliuered vnto vs by your Trumpet, by whom you sent them: although the deliuery of them was somewhat after an vnusuall fashion, the messenger approaching our wals with sounding his Trumpet, as if he had beene in an enemies Country. By which Letters of yours, we to our great wonder vnderstood, how that your intent is to conduct your Army through this Circuit of the lower <HI>Saxony,</HI> and particularly through our Country; you pretending that our beloued Brother Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Bruns|wicke</HI> may giue you occasion to seeke this passage: vnto which our answer is, that as concerning our Brother we hold not our selues obliged to maintaine any of his actions, further then they are fitly and well done, wherefore wee cannot returne answer vnto your demands for passage, without the aduice of the Princes and States of the whole Circuit, of
<PB N="12" REF="8">
the lower <HI>Saxony,</HI> nor before their generall Dyett or Meeting (which is now at hand) be finally ended. In the meane time neuerthelesse, we cannot appre|hend how our Brother the Duke <HI>Christian</HI> should giue you occasion to desire such a passage; seeing that our Brother hath not hitherto made any hostile attempts, either vpon your selfe or any man else; but containes onely his army within his owne quar|ters, which he keepes about him for his owne securi|tie; being in the meane time in all humility and sub|iection, in expectation of further <HI>extension</HI> and <HI>assecu|ration</HI> of the Imperiall pardon. But if whilest this treatie be in hand (for which time the Princes and States of the lower Circuit of <HI>Saxony,</HI> haue most humbly entreated his Imperiall Maiestie to stay and suspend all further execution) you shall of your selfe against all promise and faith giuen (as is apparent vpon record) offer to surprise or set vpon him and our lands, we will not beleeue it to bee done by the consent of the Emperour our most mercifull Lord; who, in consideration of all our sincere intentions, and most faithfully deuoted seruices performed to|wards him, will not suffer so many faithfull promises and high assurances to be called in question or mis|trusted. And in such a case we nothing doubt, that wee are likely in equitie to incurre either blame or displeasure, if vpon our owne vrgent necessitie, wee make it manifest vnto the world, how wee are driuen and constrained to fail off from our due obedience, and most submissiue deuotion, wherein wee should otherwise haue perseuered to the end; and doe
<PB N="13" REF="8">
withall in our owne defence require the assistance of the next Lords and Princes of our blood, and of his Maiestie of <HI>Denmarke</HI> especially, and like|wise of the whole Circuit of the lower <HI>Saxony.</HI> But if you would consider that although our deare Brother did stand already declared (as God bee thanked hee yet does not) an open enemie, but stands rather vpon Articles of treatie, and relies vpon the further resolution of his Imperiall Ma|iestie; you could not then, or at least ought not, according to the order which is giuen for the stay of the execution, (which order wee will by no meanes suffer to bee any wayes infringed) to in|uade this Circuit of <HI>Saxony</HI> with a forraine army, and make your selfe by that meanes master of our Lands and Subiects, which are altogether in|nocent.</P>
<P>And if any third partie (our Brother) hath of|fended; yet ought not his Lands to bee therefore molested. If you desire therefore to haue these orders obserued by vs, it is fit that you obserue them first your selfe.</P>
<P>For which reason wee yet once more desire you to spare our Dominions, and forbeare to make any march or passage through them, and not to molest vs, (who rest our selues vpon so many high promises of the Emperour) vpon which many and great dammages and inconceniences may happen and ensue; and not to raise any further iea|lousies or distrusts betwixt his Imperiall Maiesty, and the obedient Princes &amp; States which are vnder him:
<PB N="14" REF="9">
But we admonish you rather to expect his Imperiall Maiesties further resolution extension (and enlarge|ment in some points) of his former pardon to our Brother, vpon the accommodation, or taking vp, (as wee hope) of all matters betwixt them. To the en|tent, that the sinister opinions and diffidences which the Princes and States haue before conceiued con|cerning the slow performance of his Imperiall Ma|iesties many and high promises, be not more strong|ly confirmed in them; the seuerall States of the Em|pire hauing already heretofore deeply conceited such imaginations, and set downe their grieuances vnder their hands in writing.</P>
<P>Wee expect hereupon your further Resolution and Declaration, by which wee may know what we are to looke for at your hands hereafter: Till when, wee rest very well inclined towards you, and wish you all prosperitie.</P>

<P>While this was a doing; <HI>Tilly</HI> hauing lest order with the Duke of <HI>Saxon, Lawenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Holsteyn</HI> to prouide for the victualing of <HI>Duderstadt,</HI> wherein hee had left 500. Muskettiers (which town peraduenture was to be the two Dukes quarters) they with their horse Regiments (wherein they had 25. Cornets:) rambling vp and downe to get this victuall, by the pillage of the country: and staying something lon|ger then their Generalls directions had giuen order to them, and the Duke of <HI>Saxon, Lawenburgh</HI> hauing a designe in his head, for the taking in of the towne of <HI>Gottingen,</HI> for that it lay full in the way towards <HI>Hal|berstadt</HI>; which way <HI>Brunswick</HI> came; he with his fel|lowes, when they thought themselues most sure, were falne into an Ambush by a Woods side neere <HI>Gottingen</HI>; out of which on a sudden 7. cornets of horse of the Count of <HI>Shirum</HI> start vp, whereof 400. were Dragoniers, that is horsmen euery one of which (as the manner is, leauing off his Carbine or fire-locke) had taken vp a Muskettier behinde him, which 1100. Dragoniers, horsmen, and Muskettiers) charging the Duke of <HI>Lawenburghs</HI> Regiment afront, presently had the killing of 300. of them. Some small resistance but not great, the straightnes of the place suffered those

of <HI>Tilly</HI> to make; in which conflict, <HI>Saxon Lawenburgh</HI> had his horse slaine vnder him. (Which chance made the Mayor of <HI>Budensbergh,</HI> who at the same time esca|ped out of <HI>Saxon Lawenberghs</HI> custody, vnder which he was prisoner, to report him to be slaine when hee saw him fall (the Duke hardly recouered another, v|pon which fresh horse, with three others horse onely in his company; some Letters from <HI>Franckford</HI> dated Iuly 10. say that he made an escape. And at the same time, the Collonel <HI>Kniphowsens</HI> horse starting vp and setting vpon their reere, &amp; the 700. Muskettiers vpon the middle, <HI>Saxon Lawenbergh,</HI> and <HI>Holsteyn</HI> were both cut off from rescuing of their owne baggage, which was bestowed in the middle; and there (to be short) 700. of <HI>Tillyes</HI> were slaine; amongst which the Duke of <HI>Holsteyn</HI> himselfe, is in some Letters said to be one; the Captaine <HI>Montagne</HI> and another Baron were left dead in the place; the rest fled, some into the Wood, where they were left to the mercy of the Boars; there were 1000. horse taken; and all the baggage and the treasure which they of <HI>Cullen</HI> estimated to amount to 800000. Rixe Dollers. Of some horse which drue the carriages, the driuers cut off the Trayse &amp; womb-ropes by which they drew; so that the horse being thus loose and frighted, ran away, to be taken vp o|therwhere: Those of <HI>Tillyes</HI> were at first strong 25. Cornets or troopes of horse; there were 7. Ensignes or Cornets taken, and carryed to Duke <HI>Christian</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> in token of victorie; so that the whole Re|giments were vtterly defeated &amp; all the baggage ta|ken, and as some say three or foure Field-pices; So that the Duke of <HI>Saxon Lawenbergh</HI> shifting away, had not left him so much as a Shirt to shift him.

And this last description is related out of <HI>Tillyes</HI> owne Campe which Iuly 8. lay at <HI>Griebel</HI> from whence this was written. And thus the Regiments being vtterly defeated, the Conuoye for the victu|alling of <HI>Duderstadt</HI> was cut off; which victuals being by <HI>Tilly</HI> and <HI>Saxon Lawenbergh</HI> destinated at first for the reliefe of this towne of <HI>Duderstadt,</HI> was after this brought into the Towne neuerthelesse.

<P>In this gallant Army there are diuers Princes, and braue noble Spirits, as namely fiue brethren Dukes of <HI>Weymar,</HI> and three Counts of <HI>Oldenburgh:</HI> The yong

Count of <HI>Thurne</HI> is Lieutenant Generall: one of the Dukes of <HI>Weymar</HI> is chiefe Watch-maister; who in his Regiment of horse hath 420.

They call themselues <HI>The desperate Cauallierie.</HI></P>
<P>There are also as yet diuers Bohemian Lords and Barons in his Army: and we vnderstand that there came of late a certaine Hungarian Lord vnto the yong Count of <HI>Thurn,</HI> with letters of great impor|tance, although the contents be not as yet divulged. All this is written from the Dukes owne Leager, at <HI>Northeim</HI> Iuly 2.</P>
<P>In the march this order was obserued; hauing stood a while some foure houres in battalia in the fields, to see if any enemy would come against them, in which space many came from seuerall places to view their order, (a faire Army being the fairest of the three fairest things in the world.) The word be|ing giuen, they began to march. The order was in three deuisions. The Duke himselfe rode before all the rest with sixe Cornets of choyse Horse for the Guard of his person: after him followed the Duke of Saxon Weymar, who led the Vantguard, and in it 7000. horse. The Generals Lieutenant the Count of <HI>Thurne</HI> led the battell, or the body of the Army with as many more; and the Colon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">l <HI>Kniphowsen</HI> brought

vp the reare, likewise with the numbers proportio|nable to the former. Some other vnarmed men like|wise were left behind, who tarry for the Armes which one of the Dukes of Weymar brings out of Holland with him, and then they are to follow the Army.</P>
<P><HI>Brunswick</HI> aduancing forwards in this equipage, did at his first co~ming, take in the towne of <HI>Eischuelt</HI> it selfe, in and about which, he quartered his whole forces: there is Colonell <HI>Kniphowsen</HI> said, to haue killed 300. of <HI>Tillyes</HI> Souldiers: his head quarter hee layd at <HI>Northeim,</HI> which was so neere vnto Monsieur <HI>Tillyes</HI> quarters at <HI>Lindaw,</HI> that their Vantguards had euery day some exercise of their Armes, and more then light skirmishes. The Canons out of <HI>Tillyes</HI> quatters playd vpo~ <HI>Brunswicks</HI> men very hotly; which were answered by Duke <HI>Christians</HI> men againe, with sixe demy-Canons; although those of <HI>Tilly</HI> could do no great matter vpo~ <HI>Brunswicks</HI> men, by reason of the commodity of the place, vpon which they had cho|sen to make their approaches: The Duke of <HI>Saxon Weymar,</HI> and the Colonell <HI>Kniphowsen,</HI> placed them|selues behind their own Ordnance, with full resoluti|ons to set a fresh vpon the enemies, if they durst ad|uenture forth of their trenches. But whither that the wary Generall <HI>Tilly,</HI> had giuen order to his Compa|nies rather to receiue their enemies vpon their owne aduantages at push of Pyke on the top of their tren|ches, if they should proue so hot &amp; braue as to offer to force them; or that he were vnwilling to venture his men vpon a salley out of their own strengths: this the letters affirme for certain, that none of <HI>Tillies</HI> did at time issue forth; so that some bullets being spent on both sides, the night took of the brauadoe of those of <HI>Brunswick,</HI> euery man retiring to his quarter.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="13">That night or else within a night or two following; the Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> remembring that nothing becom|ming their liberties, he had prouoked the forces of the lower <HI>Saxonie,</HI> which for ought he knew, might be following after <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> and make him at the first thus braue to dare him in his very trenches, And con|sidering the late losse of two braue Regiments of horse, and that the enemie was blouded by the cut|ting off the Conuoy of victuals before <HI>Duderstadt,</HI> and the slaughter of his men there, and at <HI>Eischaelt</HI>; In all which encounters hee had lost at least 1500 or 1600 men; and considering withall, that he was by this al|ready weakened, and did daily expect fresh supplies, (some of which he then heard to be hard by) Thought it his best to retreat backe againe towards his former quarters and Garrisons in <HI>Hessenland,</HI> vpon the riuer of Werra. In which resolution, leauing great store of lights and fires in his Campe (as if he had still been there) he did vnder the opportunitie of the darknesse of the night, with as much silence, as possible could be, without sound of drumme or trumpet, closely steale away; and what betweene retreating and fleeing he retired three great German leagues (12 miles En|glish at least) that very night.

breake of day (the darknesse being vnfit, for feare of Ambushes and entrapments, for such a purpose) with might and maine pursued.</P>
<P><HI>Tillyes</HI> flight or retreate continued three daies, <HI>Til|ley</HI> being ofttimes forced to make a stand by the way, and to make head against the fierce impression of the <HI>Brunswickers.</HI> And thus sometime fighting, but most times fleeing: the Vantguard of those of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> still beat vpon his Reere, and were still cutting off the tayle of his Armie. The thirst was all this while said to be very sore in his Army; for the want of water, was said to be one of the maine reasons of his so sud|daine retreating; (there being no riuer neere to his former camp, nor other water but such as was brought on horsebacke in buckets, water-budgets, Borachoes and the like, which made it to be sold extreame deare) And all this while showers of lead ratling amongst them. <HI>Monsir Tilley</HI> was said to be faine with much disorder and danger, to haue passed some of his for|ces ouer the riuer of Werra againe.</P>
<P>In this flight, three Regiments amongst the rest, are particulariz'd to haue beene worst of all beaten and disordered; many of whose Companies, thinking it safer to runne away then to be killd with their fellowes, were scattered all ouer the Country: most of which, as they were taken pilladging for their victuals, were knockt on the head by the Bores of the Countrie. With the rest, the fight and flight continued three daies, that is the 1, 2, and third of our <HI>Iuly:</HI> so that at last <HI>Brunswicke</HI> is said to haue
<PB N="25" REF="15">
beaten them so much, that there were 7000 slaine in the place, and of prisoners so many hundreds taken. The booty was said to be great, some letters, that name least, mentioning 200 Waggons to haue beene there taken: others name no fewer then 600: there were foure peeces of Cannon taken, as some letters say, or as others, fixe: and of treasure fiue or sixe tunne of gold, and some reports haue beene so par|ticular herein, as to Iudge some of the Iewels, which were taken from some of <HI>Tillyes</HI> Commanders, to haue beene some of those, which themselues before had made pillage of at the taking of <HI>Prague</HI>: where|upon some letters boldly inferre thus much: That now is quittance cryed with the Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> for the taking of <HI>Prague.</HI> Finally, the spoile was said to be such, as that many of <HI>Brunswicks</HI> Caual|liers, were said to haue gotten aboue one thou|sand Duckats a peece, for their single and seuerall shares.</P>
<P>Some letters wee haue seene to conclude with this peremptorie and tart breaking off: that <HI>Monsir Tilly</HI> is by this hot and close pursuit of the Duke of <HI>Brunswicke,</HI> so beaten, routed, and disor|dered, that they beleeue hee will not bee able to make head againe to much purpose this Summer. And some haue yet followed him further then so: Affirming that <HI>Tilly</HI> himselfe hardly escaped (alone almost) into a little Towne of the <HI>Landtgraue</HI> of <HI>Darmstadts,</HI> but which (that we can remember) they name not, but if it were any at all, <HI>Giesen</HI> is as like|ly
<PB N="26" REF="16">
as any; as being both neere enough vnto the ri|uer of Werra, where the last of the fight is said to be, and this Towne being also newly fortified of late by the Duke. Nay some reports, will not let <HI>Tilly</HI> rest heere neither, but giue out, that <HI>Bruns|wicke</HI> sent after him thither also, requiring him as his lawfull prisoner, to bee quietly deliuered vn|to him by the <HI>Landtgraue</HI> of <HI>Darmstadt</HI>; and in case of denyall hee threatned to lay an imposi|tion of seuen or eight thousand Rixe Dollars, as a punishment vpon the <HI>Landtgraue</HI> and his Domi|nions.</P>
<P>And thus much the seuerall reports of this busi|nesse being laid together, will make vp, vnto which, wee promise the world, that wee haue added no one particular in the writing, but can readily shew the effect of euery point, out of the seuerall let|ters of seuerall dates, from <HI>Franckford, Cullen, A|quisgraue</HI> or <HI>Aken, Antwerp, Dort,</HI> and other pla|ces: And wee further affirme, that all but the last encounter of the last three daies, is alrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">y prin|ted Newes in high Dutch.</P>
<P>The Newes you heare hath gone currant o|uer the Towne for many daies, without any appa|rent or particular contradiction, more then mens mistrust of the vnlikelyhood of it. And whereas it may be thought, that all this rumour came vp at first, only vpon one letter written from <HI>Cullen,</HI> vpon some misprision of the writer; you may ea|sily
<PB N="27" REF="16">
answer this by the particulars forementioned, which being diuerse, both in the manner and num|bers; (some reporting 200 Waggons taken, and some of 600: others of foure pieces of Cannon, others of sixe, others of seuen, so that it is very vnlikely that all this varietie should arise out of one letter&punc;</P>
<P>And whereas the letters from <HI>Franckford</HI> which beare date the 12. of our <HI>Iuly,</HI> which was eight whole daies after the 3. of <HI>Iuly,</HI> which is repor|ted to be the last day of the fight; doe yet menti|on no such thing: we may readily answer to that, that though these letters intimate no mention of these particulars, yet doe they not inferre any con|tradiction to them: for it is very easie for such a businesse to be eight daies in comming out of <HI>Hessenland</HI> vnto <HI>Franckford.</HI> And againe, the writer of that intelligence professes thus much, that hee had heard of <HI>Tillyes</HI> flight or retreate for three Dutch miles: and affirmes, that hee was that day to receiue letters out of <HI>Hessen, Du|ringen,</HI> and those parts from whence the noise of this battell should come.</P>
<P>Howsoeuer; although this victory be not im|possible, yet for that diuers haue suspended their beleefes of it for a while; wee will not therefore vse arguments to shew the probabilitie of that, which a few daies may proue false; Thus much in the meane time, wee haue great reason to be|leeue our selues, that much bloud hath beene shedde, and that <HI>Tilly</HI> hath had the worst of it
<PB N="28" REF="17">
(though the reports of the particulars differ) and that <HI>Brunswicke</HI> hath hitherto kept the field. The particulars we must leaue to time, and our next in|telligence.</P>
<P>But howeuer, this small victory which we next report, is yet beyond all contradiction, being writ|ten from <HI>Culle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">, Iuly</HI> 11; which was how that, The <HI>Baron</HI> of <HI>Anholt</HI> offering to ioyne with <HI>Monsir Til|ley:</HI> that some of the Duke of <HI>Brunswickes</HI> horse had surprised and defeated a troupe of horse of the Barons, and taken their Captaine prisoner.</P>
<P>As for further Newes of the Baron of <HI>Anholt,</HI> It is constantly affirmed. That for all that the Im|perialists giue the <HI>Lantgraue</HI> of <HI>Hess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> very good words; calling him a good man, and a faithfull subiect to the Emperour: for that he made no more resistance vnto <HI>Monsir Tilly:</HI> yet question|lesse good words will not giue him satisfaction for the spoyling of his Countrie, nor does hee purpose to doe the Emperour such a pleasure, as to suffer the Baron of <HI>Anholt</HI> to come through his Countrie to ioyne with <HI>Monsir Tilly</HI>; but hauing before stopt vp all the passages, he is said to be re|solued to fight with him, rather then to suffer him to passe vntalkt withall.</P>
<P>The Baron of <HI>Anholt</HI> being in this state, did about the middle of our <HI>Iune</HI> endeauour to certifie <HI>Mon|sir Tilly</HI> of all: For which reason he dispatcht sixe messengers with letters vnto him; whereof fiue were taken and slaine about <HI>Spangenberg</HI>; but a sixth did about the 14. of <HI>Iune</HI> get vp to <HI>Tillyes</HI>

Campe with his letters, letting him to vnderstand his Lords desire to ioyne with him, if that <HI>Tilly</HI> could find the meanes to procure or open him the passages, and this they write from Monsieur <HI>Til|lyes</HI> owne campe, which at that time lay about Giebel.</P>
<P>As for other ayde which was vpon comming to <HI>Tilly,</HI> the letters from <HI>Isenach</HI> Iulie 8. relate how that the 15 of Iune being Sunday, there past about noone fiue troopes of horse, of the Regi|ment of Collonell <HI>Auentans,</HI> being for the most part Crabats, which <HI>Tilly</HI> had sent for backe a|gaine.

They marcht a quarter of a league beyond out towne of <HI>Isenach,</HI> quartering that night about <HI>Mila, Bishoffsrod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and <HI>Bercka</HI> from whence they are directly to repaire vnto Monsieur <HI>Tillyes</HI> Armie. They demeaned them|selues very mannerly where they came, paying for what they tooke, and demanding victuals and wine not beyond moderation, being otherwise content with what they found. And they report, that there are yet foure thousand horse to follow them, amongst which they affirme that there bee 1000. Cutiassers (which be horsemen heauy ar|med, and at all points <HI>cap a pie.</HI>) But whence they should come, they told not, nor doe we beleeue any such matter as foure thousand horse to bee comming to <HI>Tilly.</HI></P>
