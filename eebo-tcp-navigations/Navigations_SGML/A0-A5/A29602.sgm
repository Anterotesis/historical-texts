<P>THere is certainly a very Pretious, Noble, Royal, Long-Suffering Seed of the Eternal God of Hea|ven and Earth, the which in the&s;e latter dayes of our age &s;ince the long night of Apostacy [from Chri&s;t and his Holy Apo&s;tles and Saints life] to which the Eternal Arm of the Lord God is manife&s;tly revealed unto eternal Salvation and perfect Redemption, in and by the <HI>Light</HI> of the Lord Je&s;us (the Immanuel) who as truly <HI>light|eth every man,</HI> as he ta&s;ted <HI>Death</HI> for every man that cometh into the World, and this pretious Seed which is the <HI>Light</HI> that is &s;own for the Righteous,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">And the People become perfect|ly Righteous that believe in and obey the &s;ame light of Je&s;us, and are there|by made partakers of the Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, and &s;o of the &s;ame nature of God, which comes to be revealed from faith to &s;aith in Male and Female, for which end the light which is the Seed is &s;own in the heart, is the Light &s;hines in darkne&s;s which com|prehends not that which is the trea|&s;ure in the earthen Ve&s;&s;el as a pearl hid in a field, and is the good thing which can give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.2. <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.19. <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.19. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.</NOTE> the &s;ame hath been vi&s;ited from on high as a thing hid in ob|&s;curity in many, under the Region and Shaddow of Death and De&s;truction, &s;o that it hath been quick|ned and revived mightily to the amazement and a|&s;toni&s;hment of Kindreds, Nations, Tongues and peo|ples becau&s;e of the arm of the Lords Salvation, with which he hath ari&s;en in his Maje&s;ty and &s;haken terribly
<PB REF="3"> the Earth and Heavens al&s;o, and made the Keepers of the &s;trong Mans Hou&s;e to tremble, and by his power of ho|line&s;s to bind him and &s;poile his goods; So that the ever|la&s;ting <HI>Light</HI> hath &s;ent his Word (of Power) into <HI>Jacob,</HI> and it hath lighted upon Poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> in who&s;e hou&s;e he, the Lord God (that Spirit) hath promi&s;ed to dwell in the midst for ever, as in the <HI>Antient dayes,</HI> and many of the Eternal Off-&s;pring of Life which is the <HI>Light of men,</HI> having gladly received the Word of Life, not from man nor by man that &s;hall dye, but from his mouth, <HI>that was dead and is alive, and behold he liveth for evermore,</HI> that leads his Flock like a good Shepherd to Living Springs and Fountains, which are as wells <HI>&s;pring|ing up into everla&s;ting Life,</HI> in them that believe, as the Scripture hath &s;aid, <HI>John 4.

<P>And the&s;e as Lambs among Wolves, having the ble&s;sed Life and Salvation to Proclaim in Faithfulne&s;s, travelling in their innocent integrity on this wi&s;e, as our Brethren the Prophets and Fathers of old did from one Na|tion to another People; Now why are the Nations angry? and why do the Mighty and Potentates of the Earth com|bine and take Coun&s;el together again&s;t the Lord and his <HI>Anointed?</HI> Is it not becau&s;e the Eternal God is provo|king them to jealou&s;ie and to anger with a fooli&s;h Nation, with them which are deemed not a People, who are Poor, Afflicted, De&s;pi&s;ed, De&s;tre&s;&s;ed on every hand, yet not for&s;aken of the Lord their Rock, their Strength, <HI>Deut. 32.</HI></P>
<P>Now it came to pa&s;s that after the Lord God <HI>[who formeth the Mountains and Createth the Wind which obeyeth him,] Amos. 4. la&s;t.</HI> had given three more of my Brethren together with me a good pa&s;&s;age from the Land of our Nativity to <HI>Italy,</HI> namely, to <HI>Legorne,</HI> where two of us, (to wit) <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>Henry Fell,</HI>
<PB REF="3"> was ordered of the Lord to pa&s;&s;e from thence towards <HI>Alex|andria</HI> and they became obedient; and it came to pa&s;s al&s;o by the permi&s;&s;ion of God who &s;uffered the men of our own Nation to Bani&s;h and expel them away from that Region and Coa&s;t, where they gave a &s;ound of the <HI>Mighty Day of Gods vi&s;itation,</HI> and &s;aith Chri&s;t, <HI>as they have done unto me, &s;o will they do unto you, &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Gada|renes</HI> loved their Swine and be&s;ought Chri&s;t to depart out of their Coa&s;t, and them that Rebel against the <HI>Light,</HI> &s;aith, <HI>depart from us</HI> (even to the mo&s;t High) <HI>for we de|&s;ire not the knowledge of thy wayes,</HI> Job. <HI>21.</HI> Job. <HI>24. 13, 14.</HI></P>
<P>And furthermore my Dear Brother <HI>Richard Sco&s;trope</HI> my Companion in Tribulation and in the Power of God, by which we were al&s;o ordered (having no impo&s;ition from any mortal man on our Con&s;ciences God is witne&s;s) was ordained of God to pa&s;s Eastward, towards <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> namely, to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> intending al&s;o to travel further (if the Lord &s;uffered not Sathan to hinder;) and behold when we came there, having enjoyed the benefit of a good pa&s;&s;age, that the Merchants and Great men and others of our own Na|tion did not a little perplex and burthen them&s;elves not only at our bodily pre&s;ence, but al&s;o with our faithful and true innocent and harmle&s;s me&s;&s;age of life, and glad ti|dings of Salvation to the Nations, and verily they cannot deny but that our behaviour and deportment (if they &s;peak truth) was &s;uch as we profe&s;&s;ed in Words and Doctrine in all good Conver&s;ation while&s;t we abode among them, as examples in the manifold Di&s;pen&s;ations of the grace of God Almighty, to whom be the Glory over all, <HI>A|men.</HI></P>
<P>We being at our fir&s;t coming &s;ent for before the Con&s;ul of the Nation, gave him a good and &s;ober information of the intent of our hearts as God had ordered and determi|ned
