<P>_THe 14. day of March,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1607.</NOTE> 1607. w&eacute;e came into the Downes, and there ancored against <HI>Deale,</HI> a|bout 3. miles from <HI>Sandwich,</HI> where we staied vntill the 25. day of the same moneth, being by computation the first day of the y&eacute;ere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1608.</NOTE> 1608. vpon which day, about foure of the clock in the morning, we waighed ancor and past by <HI>Douer,</HI> be|tw&eacute;ene thr&eacute;e and foure of the clocke in the afternoone, without any staying, but giuing them notice with 3. peeces of Ordinance of our passing by, and so passed forwards some thr&eacute;e leagues, and then by a contrary winde we were driuen backe againe into <HI>Douer</HI> roade where we ancored and staied till fiue of the clocke in the morning, being the twenty sixe day of <HI>March.</HI> and then weighing ancor, we sailed some thr&eacute;e leagues, when the winde contrarying constrained vs againe to cast ancor vntill the 27. day in the morning about se|uen
<PB N="2" REF="5">
or eight of the clocke, and then hauing a faire gale of winde, we sailed to <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where we arriued the 29. day between tenne and eleuen of the clocke in the forenoone, where we staied till the thirtie one day of March. And then hauing a faire gale of winde, wee waighed ancor and sailed vntill wee came in sight of an Iland called the <HI>Saluages,</HI> on Sunday being the tenth day of <HI>Aprill,</HI> being about fiue hundred leagues from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and still sailed forwards vntill the next morning, that we came within sight of the grand Canaries, which belong to the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> And vpon the twelfth day of Aprill, about eight or nine of the clocke in the night we ancored, and discharged a peece of Ordinance, for a boat to come aboard, but to no ef|fect: For before our ariuall in the road, there was a rumor of twelue saile of <HI>Flemmings</HI> that were co~ming that way, to no good intent (as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> after|ward told vs) to be some of those <HI>Flemmings</HI> that had ouerrunne the rest, where upon they sent vp into the Countrey for one hundred and fifty horse and foot or more, for their defence and safegard (if n&eacute;ede should be) nor would they be peswaded to the contrarie, vn|till two of our Factors went on shore, and fully satis|fied them in any thing they demanded or doubted, and that our intent was only to make prouision for such things as we wanted, and the next morning, (as the manner there is) we discharged another p&eacute;ece of Or|dinance. And then the Gouernour of the Towne sent a boat to know what we craued, whereupon we certi|fied them of our wants, and they told vs they would giue the Gouernour intelligence, and returne vs an answere, which was, that vnlesse wee came into the road, it was beyond his Commission to releeue vs, yet hauing first sworne and examined our Factors, and so knowing the truth of our intended voiage, they gaue them a warrant to take a boat, to come aboard at their pleasures with licence to supply our wants, if
<PB N="3" REF="5">
they had any thing that might content vs. Yet one thing aboue the rest made vs much to maruell, which was, two <HI>English</HI> ships (which wee perceiued and knew by their flagges) being in the road, who had not so much kindnesse in them as to giue vs notice, of the custome or manners of these subtill and currish peo|ple. And of this doubt, wee were also resolued, that no man whatsoeuer, being once within their Do|minions, may come aboard any ship, that shall arriue there, and lie out of the roade, although they be of their owne Nation, without their Gouernors and Coun|cels permittance or licence. At our being there some of them came aboard of vs euery day for the space of fiue daies that wee staied there, and eat and dranke with vs, after an vnsatiable manner, and very gr&eacute;e|dily. Also we sent the Gouernor a present of two ch&eacute;e|ses, a Gammon of bakon, and fiue or sixe harrels of pickle Oisters, which he accepted very thankefully and returned vs in requital therof, two or thr&eacute;e Goats and a Sh&eacute;epe or two, and good store of Unions. And there we tooke in fresh water, Canarie wine, Mar|malad of Quinces at twelue pence the pound, little barrels of Suckets at three shillings the barrell, O|ranges, Limmons, Ponicitrions and excellent faire white bread made with Annis&eacute;eds, and is by them cal|led Nunnes bread.</P>
<P>The eight&eacute;enth day of Aprill about seuen of the clocke in the morning, we waighed Ancor and set saile hauing a faire gale of wind for some thr&eacute;e houres and being then becalmed, we houered too &amp; fro till the 21. day, and hauing then againe a faire gale of winde, we sailed vntill the 27. day about two or three of the clock in the afternoone, that we ariued &amp; ancored at <HI>Mayo,</HI> being about thr&eacute;e hundred leagues from the <HI>Canaries,</HI> and comming from thence, wee were determined to take in fresh water at a place called <HI>Bonauista,</HI> but ha|uing ancored we found the water to bee two or three
<PB N="4" REF="6">
miles, vp in the land, neither was it cleare water, so that we tooke the smaller quantity. But thero were o|ther good commodities. For at our first comming we were told by two <HI>Negroes,</HI> that there wee might haue as many Goats as we would, <HI>gratis,</HI> and I well remember, we had to the number of two hundred, or there abouts in both our ships. Also-they told vs that there were but twelu men in the Iland, and that there was verie great store of Salt growing out of the ground so that (if we pleased) we might lade both our ships therewith, it is excellent good white salt, and as cleare as euer I saw any in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Ouer against the Ile of <HI>Mayo,</HI> some eight leagues distance, is an Iland called <HI>S. Deago</HI>; wee staied at <HI>Mayo</HI> from the twenty seuenth of Aprill in the after|noone vntill the fourth day of May at sixe of the clocke in the morning, when we set saile and sailed vntill the twentieth day of May, that we were past the Equino|ctiall line, about 4. or 6. of the clocke in the morning, being distant fro~ the Ile of <HI>Mayo</HI> about thr&eacute;e hundred fourty eight leag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es or there abouts, as our master <HI>Philip de Grone</HI> noted it downe in his owne Booke of the description of the whole Uoiage. And thence we still sailed forwards vntill the fourth of Iuly, that wee ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e to a part of <HI>Souldania</HI> with al our men in health, Gods name be praised, but two which were touched a little with the scuruy, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">one after recouered themselues on shore to their former health.</P>
<P>Also the same day we espied Land which is called, <HI>Cape bona Speranse</HI> being some fifteene or sixteene leagues of <HI>Souldania</HI> and standeth in some thirty fiue Degr&eacute;es or thereabouts.</P>
<P>At <HI>Souldania</HI> wee refreshed our selues excellently well so long as we were there, and had, and tooke in for our prouision about foure hundred head of Cattel, as Oxen, St&eacute;eres, Sheepe and Lambes, and foules, and fish of sundry sorts very plentifull, and fresh wa|ter,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
great store. Also in that place is an Iland called <HI>Pengwin,</HI> some fiue or sixe leagues from the maine Land, where are great store of fowles called also <HI>Pen|gwins,</HI> infinite number of Sealles: And to fetch some of those Seales, we went twice thither and filled our boat each time, and made tranie Oile thereof for Lampes. Also in this Iland we found 20. fat sh&eacute;epe, being left there by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for a Pinnis which we met some two hundred leagues from <HI>Cape bona Speranse,</HI> which sh&eacute;epe we tooke with vs and left sixe beasts or bullocks in their steads.</P>
<P>At our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">irst comming to <HI>Souldania,</HI> wee began to build or set vp our Pinnis, and launched her the fifth day of September next following, and in seuen or eight daies after, she was rigged and ready in all points to haue gone away, if any such necessity had b&eacute;ene.</P>
<P><HI>Souldania</HI> is within the Kingdome of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> Now the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> are by nature very brutish or beastly people, especially in their feeding. For I haue s&eacute;ene them eate the guts &amp; garbedge, yea euen the very panch where the dung &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ilth lieth. Also when we haue cast off those Seale fishes into the riuer neere adioi|ning where they haue lyen the space of fourt&eacute;en daies, and that they haue b&eacute;ene putri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ied and stuncke so veh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mently, that it could almost haue stifled one of vs to come by them, these people haue taken them vp and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aten them when they haue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">warmed with cranling maggots.</P>
<P>Also in this Countrey are sundry sorts of wilde beasts, which my selfe and others of our Company (going on shore of purpose) haue seene, and perceiued some of them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e very fierce and cruell: so that af+terwards when we found their dens, we durst not en|ter them, nor come very neere them, lest they should be in them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ethiopians</HI> brought downe to the shore side to
<PB N="6" REF="7">
sell Estridgs egges and some empty shels, with a small hole in one end, with Estridges feathers and Porpentines quils, and for all their Traffique and Commodities, they chiefly desire Iron, est&eacute;eming it more then either gold or siluer. For with our old iron, we bought all our Cattell and any thing else that we had of them.</P>
<P>In this Countrey wee remained from the foure|t&eacute;enth day of Iuly vntil the twentieth day of Septem|ber then next following.</P>
<P>The 20. day of September earely in the morning we waighed ancor, and that night we lost the good ship called the <HI>Vnion,</HI> and our Pinnis called by the name of the <HI>Good hope,</HI> the night being very darke and windy, now, the euening before we lost them, the <HI>V|nion</HI> (about fiue of the Clocke) put out her Ensigne, but to what intent we knew not, nor could imagine, but all that night we lay at hull.</P>
<P>The next day being the 21. day hauing a faire and strong gale of winde, and afterwards sundry contra|ry windes and many calmes, yet at length wee attai|ned to the height of <HI>S. Laurence</HI> on the 27. day of Octo|ber standing in the height of 26. degrees, from whence we sailed with many crosse and contrary winds, and calmes. Yet at length on the 22. day of Nouember in the morning wee descried two or thr&eacute;e small Ilands, and in the afternoone we espied an Iland called <HI>Go|mora</HI> a very high Land: and on the 24. day we sent our boat to the shore side, and there came to the shore side fiue or sixe men of that Countrey, and sold vs Plantains, and nothing else at that time.</P>
<P>The next day we sent our boat againe, but a little before they came to the shore they espied a <HI>Cannooe</HI> and two men in it a fishing, we went betweene them and the shore but would not violently take them, then we shewed them a knife o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two, and they came both into our Boat, and we brought them aboard our Ship
<PB N="7" REF="7">
and vsed them very kindly, and gaue one of them a Turbant to put on his head and to the other a little glasse of a quarter of a pinte full of <HI>Aquauitae,</HI> and sent them ashore. From the 22. day that wee espied the I|land <HI>Gomora,</HI> and came amongst the Ilands wee could haue no st&eacute;edy gale of wind to carry vs forward, vntill the 25. day that with the wind and aid of our Pinnis, which towed our ship betweene the two I|lands adioining to the shore, we came to an ancor that night betw&eacute;ene foure and fiue of the Clocke in some 17. or 20. fathome water.</P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6. day wee sent our boat to the shore with a present to the King, by master <HI>Iordan</HI> who went him|selfe alone with the present, leauing onely a pledge or two in the boate till his returne: The present was a paire of Kniues, a Shash or Turbant, and a loo|king glasse with a combe in it, to the value of some 15. shillings in all, which the King receiued somewhat scornefully, not scarse looking on it, or at the least thinking it to be but of small value, and gaue it to one of his Noble men, and told master <HI>Iordan</HI> our Factor, that if our Generall would come on shore, hee should haue any thing that they had, and with this answer he departed, and at his comming from the King, the King bowed himselfe towards him in very courteous manner and after his departure (as it may seeme) hee better perused the present. For in the afternoone he sent our Generall in requitall, a very fat yongue Bul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">locke, which wee receiued, and gratified the messeng|ers with a couple of peny kniues, wherewith they thought themselues verie royally contented. The 27. day our Generall went on shore and some 12. with him, and carried with him a small banquet: as, a box of Marmaled, a barrell of Suckets, and Wine, which they did eat before the King, but he would nei|ther eat nor drinke, but his Nobles did both eat and drinke. And after the banket hauing some conference
<PB N="8" REF="8">
with the King by his Interpreter concerning our wants, by whom wee vnderstood that they had, some dealings with the <HI>Portugals,</HI> of which language he could speake a little, which was sufficient to satis|fie vs with what they had.</P>
<P>The 28. day the King had determined to come a|board our ship, but his Interpretor told vs, that his Councel and the common people would not suffer him so to doe. Also that day towards night I went a shore where our people were cutting downe woode, and came aboard againe with the boat.</P>
<P>The 29. day I went ashore againe, with our Ma|ster, master <HI>Tindall,</HI> master <HI>Iordan,</HI> and our whole noise of Trumpeters, and at the shore side were very kindly entertained by the Interpretor, who brought vs to the King, being then by his Pallace side, who at our approch bowed himselfe vnto vs very courteous|lie. He hath for his gard when he walketh abroad sixe or eight men with kniues of a foot long, and as broad as hatchets and very sharpe, which goe next to his person, and more goe before him, and many behinde him, to keepe and defend him, from what iniurie or wrong soeuer may come or happen.</P>
<P>These people seeme to bee ciuill, kinde, and true hearted to strangers, for in going too and fro, a shore and aboard, one of our men carelesly left his sword behinde him at night when he came aboard, which be|ing found by one of the people of <HI>Gomora,</HI> he brought it to the King, who perceiuing it to bee some of ours, demanded how hee came by it, who answered, hee found it, and the King againe told him, that if he pro|ued the contrary it should cost his best blood, the next day at our comming on shore, the Kings Interpretor brought vs the sword and told vs the Kings pleasure therein.</P>
<P>Also they s&eacute;eme to haue a very ciuill gouernment amongst them, for at their meeting in the morning,
<PB N="9" REF="8">
they will shake hands each with other, and speake one to another, which to vs s&eacute;emed to bee their kinde and friendly salutations one to another. They are verie modest, streight, big limmed, and very comely in ge|sture both men and women. Their Religion Maho|meticall, and goe almost naked, onely their priuities are couered with linnen cloth, and Turbants on their heads.</P>
<P>The women haue a linnen cloth, that couereth their breasts before and reacheth to the middle, and from the middle to the knee and somewhat lower, they are couered round about with linnen, next to their skin, and sedges tied round about them like a rowle at their waste, and hung down, which doth become them very well.</P>
<P>They goe all barefoot except the King, who hath a paire of soles on his f&eacute;et: and for his apparell when I saw him, he had a white wrought networke Cap, a Scarlet wastcote loose about him, and open before, with sleeues and a linnen cloth about his middle, and another which hanged downe from his shoulders to his f&eacute;et.</P>
<P>Also at our being there at the Town, they brought vs Coquo nuts to sell, as bigge as a mans head, and round, and some bigger and some lesser, with water in them according to the proportion or bignesse of the shell, and as much meat in one shell as would suffice for a wans dinner.</P>
<P>Also they brought vs Goats, Hens, Chickens, Li|mons, Rice, Milke, Fish, and such like, which wee bought for Commodities, as two hens for a penny knife, Limmons, and Coquonuts for old Iron, as nailes, broken pickes, and such like. But for fresh water there is small store, and that they haue is gotten out of the sands, <HI>viz.</HI> First, they make a hole in the sands and when the water commeth into the hole, they lade it out into their Coquo shels, and so drinke
<PB N="10" REF="9">
it. They brought vs of that water but none of our company would drinke thereof it looked so thicke and muddy.</P>
<P>In this Iland of <HI>Gomora</HI> wee staied from the 25. day of Nouember vntill the 29. of the same, and then we waighed Ancor and departed.</P>
<P>The tenth day of December about two or three of the Clocke in the morning, and the Moone shining, we espied on a sudden a low land with high trees gro|wing by the shore side, we being not a league from the shore, so that if we had not espied the trees, we should haue thought the land to haue b&eacute;ene but the shadow of the Moone and so might haue run our selues on shore, and cast our selues away with ship and goods: but it was Gods good prouidence thus to defend vs from so great and imminent danger, whose name be blessed and praised now and euermore.</P>
<P>This was the Iland of <HI>Pemba,</HI> which we tooke to be <HI>Zinzabar,</HI> vntill by one of the people of the Coun|trie we found it to be <HI>Pemba.</HI> At the sight of this low Iland, after we plainely perceiued it, wee presently tackt about and set from the shore till day, and then we tackt about againe to the shore side, and neering alongst the shore side for a harbour to ancor in, wee sent our Pinnis in the meane time, to the shore with the Gang onlie and master <HI>Elmore</HI> to seeke for a con|uenient watering place, wee k&eacute;eping our course till our Pinnis came to the shore side. Then two or three of the people of the Iland demanded in the <HI>Portugall</HI> language what we were, and one of our men made an|swer, that we were <HI>Englishmen.</HI> Then they deman|ded againe what we had to doe there, in regard the King of <HI>Portugall</HI> was King of that Iland: wee replied, that wee knew not so much, neither came we thither for any euill intent whatsoeuer, but only to water, and would giue them satisfaction, for any o|ther thing that we should haue of them. Then it drew
<PB N="11" REF="9">
towards night, and our men came aboard and ac|quainted the whole Company with this their parly on shore.</P>
<P>The 11. day our boat went ashore to the same place, but found it void of people and returned, and presently we came to an ancor, about fiue or sixe of the Clocke in the afternoone n&eacute;ere vnto two or three bro|ken Ilands there, adioyning n&eacute;ere to the maine Iland of <HI>Pemba.</HI> This place of our then ancoring standeth in the height of fiue Degr&eacute;es and 20. minutes.</P>
<P>The 12. day our Pinnis went on shore to the same place, with master <HI>Iordan,</HI> one of our Merchants. At whose comming on shore, after some conference with some that could speake <HI>Portugall,</HI> but not with those (as it seemed) with whom we spake the day before, for these told master <HI>Iordan</HI> the King was a <HI>Mallaibar,</HI> and after some other conference, master <HI>Iordan</HI> told them, that although our ship were an English ship, yet he was a <HI>Portugall</HI> Merchant, and the goods in the ship were <HI>Portugals</HI> goods. Then they told vs wee should not want for any thing they had, and hereupon they sent a <HI>Moore</HI> into our boat to make search for a conuenient watering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lace, who after some small search, brought vs to a little hole at the bottome of a hill, being hemmed in with the hill on the one side and a dich on the other side, there we filled our Barr&eacute;e|coes, and being ready to goe aboard, wee desired the <HI>Moore</HI> to goe aboard with vs, who will<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gly agreed thereto, and we vsed him very kindly, till the next morning that we went to water againe, and carried him on shore with vs, by whose report of his kinde v|sage aboard, there came downe with him, another that could speake a little <HI>Portugal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> who (as hee said) was one of the Kings Gentlemen, him wee also brought aboard and vsed him very kindly, and set him a shore the next day.

which he did accordingly, and then our Master, with master <HI>Reuet</HI> and my selfe went a shore with some others of the Company, where wee dined, and after dinner came two Cauelliers, and a <HI>Moore</HI> being one of their flaues to the watering place, where our men were filling of the Caske, and asked whether there were any of the chiefe of our ship, or Company there, to who~ <HI>Edward Churchman</HI> one of our Compa|ny made answer, &amp; said there was our Master, and one of the Merchants, whom (if it pleased them) he would bring to parlee with them: and at their m&eacute;eting, they saluted each other after the <HI>Portugall</HI> maner. And after some Conference, demanding what wee were, we told them we were <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and they replied that we were very welcome, and all that they had, or the Iland could afford, was at our command and dis|posing; to whom we gaue harty thanks.</P>
<P>But those sugred words of theirs, was only in out|ward shew, to cloake their treacherous practises, as afterward we found it true.</P>
<P>Then we demanded what they were, and it was answered, that one of them was the Kings brother, who instantly shewed vs a siluer ring, whereon was ingrauen the number of villages, and houses, or cotta|ges in the Iland, and said he was Ruler and Gouer|nor of all those places. Then we asked them, if there were any <HI>Portugals</HI> in the Iland, they said no, for they had banished them all because they would haue reliefe there perforce, and would make slaues of the people of the Iland, (which being not able to indure) they made continuall warres with them at their comming thither.</P>
<P>In the meane time, our Pinnis came on shore, which had b&eacute;ene at an other place of the Iland for Cat|tell, according to appointment, but were deferred of, till they might get fitter opportunity for their inten|ded treacherie.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="10">Then our men told vs that they had heard of that side of the Iland where they were for Cattell that 15. saile of <HI>Hollanders</HI> had lately taken <HI>Mosemb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge,</HI> and put all the <HI>Portugals</HI> to the sword, which newes they had heard from <HI>Zinzibar</HI> to be true, whereat these Ca|uelliers s&eacute;emed outwardly to reioice, which was also another subtill traine to bring vs within compasse of their intended treachery. And when night drew on, we intreated them to goe aboard with vs, which then, they refused to doe, but promised to come aboard the next day being the seuenteenth day of December, which the Kings brother (as he named himselfe) did with two others, but before they came aboard, they craued pledges, which they had, <HI>viz. Thomas Caue, Gabriel Brooke,</HI> and <HI>Laurence Pigot</HI> our Surgeon. The other thr&eacute;e being then aboard, we vsed them ve|rie kindly vntill they went on shore, on the eight&eacute;enth day in the morning: And our General gaue the chiefe of them two Goats, a paper Cartridge of Gunpow|der and some other small trifles to the other two, and so went on shore, and master <HI>Reuet,</HI> master <HI>Iordan, M. Glascot</HI> &amp; my selfe went with them for our pledges, &amp; at our comming on shore and fearing no treacherie, we went sixe or eight vnaduisedly vp to the houses for our pledges, whom we found garded with fifty or sixty men armed with seuerall weapon, as Bowes and Arrowes, Swords and Bucklers, Darts, and Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ltleaxes, yet at our comming thither, wee re|ceiued our pledges and without longer stay, depar|ted to the Sea side, accompanied with the Kings brother, and immediatly most of those <HI>Moores</HI> came also after vs, and sixe or eight of them came to our Pinnis side and viewed her and so departed againe to the rest of their fellowes.</P>
<P>And we instantly entered our boat, and intreated the Kings brother to go aboard with vs, which he willing|ly did, &amp; we entertained him with all kindnes that we
<PB N="14" REF="11">
could, vntill towards night that he was to depart, when our Master offered him a knife, with some other odde trifles, which he scornfully refused, and presently went a|shoare in our boat. Upon this, we mistrusted some tre|chery, intended against vs, and therefore thought to bee better armed at our next comming ashoare.</P>
<P>The 19. day our Long-boat went a shore in the mor|ning verie early, to fill our Caske with water, and ha|uing filled the same, within a litle, they espied our sailes out, being let downe to dry; but they imagined we were going away: where vpon the companion to the Kings bro|ther came to our boatswaine, and asked him if wee were going away; The boat-swaine, as well as he could, both by signes and otherwise, told him, it was only to dry our sailes. And as they were thus talking, they espied our Pinnace comming, being then very well armed, and left off making any further inquirie; which Pinnace had they not then espied, it was likely they had intended to haue cut off our men, and taken our boat; for there was two of these Rogues at the least lying in ambush about the wa|tering place, readie to haue giuen the onset, if the watch|word had been giuen. By this time our Pinnace was come to the shore, and our men standing on their gard vpon the sands, not farre from her, then our Master sent <HI>Nicholas White,</HI> one of our gang, to tell them of the Iland that our Merchants were come on shoare, who passing by one of their houses, might perceiue the same to be full of people, &amp; amongst the rest, six Portugales, in long bran|ched damaske Coats, lined with blew taffata, and vnder the same, white callico br&eacute;eches. This <HI>Nichol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s White,</HI> at his returne, told vs, and presently came downe the com|panion to the Kings brother, and told Master <HI>Reuet,</HI> the Marchants were weary, and intreated them to go vp to the~ to see the Cattell, which was only one bullock which <HI>Nicholas White</HI> saw at his going vp, and no more. But Master <HI>Reuet</HI> craued pardon, des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring him to send downe the Bullocke, and their was commodities in the boat to
<PB N="15" REF="11">
make satisfaction for the same. With this answer, and see|ing vs better armed then we were wont to bee, he went away. The Kings brother being then on the sands, com|manded a Negro to gather Coquonuts to send to our General, and made choise of <HI>Edward Churchman</HI> one of our men, to fetch the same, whom we neuer saw after, nor could euer know what became of him; But when they saw that none of vs would come a shore, but stood vpon our gard, they gaue the watchword and sounded a horne, and presently set vpon our men at the watering place and slew <HI>Iohn Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ington,</HI> the boat-swaines man, and wounded <HI>Robert Buckler,</HI> Master <HI>Ellanors</HI> man very sore, with 8. or 10. seuerall wounds, and had killed him, but that we discharged a Musket or two, which (as it see|med) hurt some of them; for then they retired and cried out: and so (though weake and faint) he did at length re|couer our boat. Also two or thr&eacute;e more of our men by cr&eacute;e|ping, and lying close in the ditch, vntill they espied our boat, got also safe aboard; and then counting our men, we only missed <HI>Edward Churchman,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Harrington,</HI> that was slaine: and so comming aboard, we certified the company of all our proc&eacute;edings on shoare; and our Sur|geon dressed <HI>Robert Buckler,</HI> and after, did his best for his cure and recouery of his health.</P>
<P>The twentieth day in the morning we went on shoare with our Pinnace and Long-boat, very wel armed to fetch in our Dauid, (which is a piece of wood or timber wherewith we hale vp our Ancor) and a little beyond the same, we found <HI>Iohn Harrington</HI> dead, and starke naked, whom we buried at another Iland, hard by the maine Iland.</P>
<P>The naturall people of the Iland <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mba,</HI> s&eacute;eme to bee louing and kind: for they made signes to me and others, at our first comming, to beware of our throats cutting: which then we tooke no heede or notice of, vntill this their treachery put vs in minde thereof againe.</P>
<P>The same day (being the 20. day) we waighed Ancor,
<PB N="16" REF="12">
and about 12. of the clocke at night, our ship was on ground, on the shoulds of <HI>Meluidee,</HI> or <HI>Pemba,</HI> which we certainely knew not: Yet God of his mercy, (as formerly in the late pretended treacherie, so in that extreamity) did mightily defend and preserue vs, whose name bee praised and glorified now and euer|more.</P>
<P>The 21. day in the morning, wee espied thr&eacute;e saile being small boats, sleightly wrought together, called <HI>Paugaias</HI> which we made after and tooke, which they on shore espying, they sent out an Aduisor being also a <HI>Paugaia,</HI> which perceiued that wee had taken the o|ther and returned to the shore.</P>
<P>Now of those which we had taken there were some 6. or 8. of the chiefest that were thought by our com|pany to be <HI>Portugals,</HI> the rest being certainely known to be <HI>Moores,</HI> and were in all some fourty and odde persons, and those sixe or eight were pale and white, much differing from the colour of the <HI>Moores,</HI> Yet being asked, what they were, they said, they were <HI>Moores,</HI> and shewed vs their backes all written with Characters; and when we affirmed them to be <HI>Portu|gals,</HI> they then told vs the <HI>Portugals</HI> were not circum|cised.</P>
<P>But to conclude; our Company would not be per|swaded but that they were <HI>Portugals:</HI> then some of our Co~pany told them of al the intended treacheries with the losse of two of our men, and wounding of the the third, which made them fearefull of our reuenge, (as it seemed) and then they talked together in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r owne language, which made vs also suspect, some vil|lanous and desperat attempt to be pretended by them, and therefore, I kept my selfe still vpon the poope, and looked carefully to the swords which stood naked|ly in the Masters Cabbin, which they also knew and noted, and marked Master <HI>Glaskock,</HI> and my selfe where we set our swords still expecting to haue the
<PB N="17" REF="12">
place voided, which I perceiuing, kept good watch, lest greater hurt should ensue thereby, and being thus alone on the poope they beckoned me thr&eacute;e or four seue|rall times to come to them vpon the spare D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ck, which I denied, lest they should so recouer the swords, where|by far more harme might haue b&eacute;ene done, then after|wards was done.</P>
<P>Then our Master came vpon the spare decke and demanded, which was their Pilot, whom hee tooke downe into his Cabbin, and shewed him his plat, which he at his comming downe did very earnestly behold.</P>
<P>But at his going from the rest with our Master, he spake in the <HI>Moores</HI> language, warning them (as we thought) to looke to themselues and doe their best a|mongst vs, and to giue eare when he gaue the watch|word, and then to giue the Onset.</P>
<P>Also there were speaches vsed that the Pilot had a knife about him, and being searched for it, he nimblie conueied the same from the one side to the other, and therwith suddenly stabbed the Master into the belly, &amp; then cried out, which (belike) was the Watchword: For then they began the onset on the spare decke, where Master <HI>Glascocke,</HI> Master <HI>Tindall,</HI> our Gene|rall, and one or two more with them chanched to kill foure or fiue of the white Roagues, and made such ha|uocke among the rest, that at length they had slaine al|most fourty of them, and brought the rest in subie|ction.</P>
<P>Now, a little before our Master thus called the Pi|lot, he entreated our Generall, that if they had any garuances or peason (being their Country food) they would let vs haue some, which they should be paid for, &amp; what was taken from them should be redeliuered, with fr&eacute;e liberty to go where they would, whereto the General consented, &amp; heereupon our Master called the Pilot, to see if he had any skil in the Plat, and so to let
<PB N="18" REF="13">
him depart, and all the rest. But when thus treache|rously they offered vs the first abuse, we could doe no lesse then we did, being in our owne defence, and for the safegard of our liues.</P>
<P>Yet did some fiue or sixe of these villaines, recouer a <HI>Pangaia</HI> by their excellent swiftnesse in swimming, and escaped to the shore, they swimming to windward, faster then our Pinnis could rowe.</P>
<P>In this skirmish were hurt but thr&eacute;e of our Com|pany, namely, Master <HI>Glascocke,</HI> with two wounds, whereof one was a deepe wound in his backe, Master <HI>Tindals</HI> was aimed at his breast, he hauing nothing in his hand to defend himselfe, yet by the assistance of the Almighty he turned himselfe about and receiued the stabbe in his arme, and our Masters was in his belly, as is formerly said, which (God be thanked) they all recouered and were well cured.</P>
<P>The 19. day of Ianuary w&eacute;e espied many Ilands, which the <HI>Portugals</HI> call by the name of <HI>Almaisant,</HI> be|ing to the number of nine Ilands, al vnpeopled as the <HI>Portugals</HI> write and affirme.</P>
<P>The 20. day we sent our Pinnis in the morning to one of those Ilands to s&eacute;eke fresh water, but could finde none: yet they found there great store of Land Tur|tles, and brought some sixe aboard, then wee sailed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o an other Iland, which seemed more likely for fresh water then the first, where we cast Ancor.</P>
<P>The 21. day about ten of the Clock in the forenoone Riding there at twelue or thirt&eacute;ene fathome water, and a reasonable good harbour, we staied there vntill the first day of February, and then waighed Ancor, and departed. Here we refreshed our selues very well with fresh water, Coquonuts, fish, Palmitoes, and Doues, great plenty.</P>
<P>The first day of February, we set saile, and sailed with a faire winde vntill the 19. day, that w&eacute;e passed the Equinoctiall line, and on the fift&eacute;enth day in the
<PB N="19" REF="13">
morning betime, we came within ken of land, which was the coast of <HI>Melueidey</HI> vpon the maine.</P>
<P>The 16. day we came to an Ancor, about nine of the Clocke in the morning, at 12. fathome water, and some two leagues from the shore, and presently wee sent our Pinnis to the shore to s&eacute;eke some refreshing, but they could by no meanes get on shore; nor would the people of the Countrey (being fearefull) come within parly, which at their returne they certified our Master of, and so in the afternoone we set saile againe, and departed.</P>
<P>Now about this time it pleased God, (by the con|fession of <HI>William Acton,</HI> one of our ship boies) to re|ueale a foule and detestable sinne committed amongst vs; which being approued against him by a Iury, h&eacute;e was condemned to die, and was executed for the same on the third day of March (being Friday) in the mor+ning.</P>
<P>The 21. day betimes in the morning, we espied an Iland standing in the height of 12. Degr&eacute;es and 17. minutes, being barren and vnpeopled, ouer against which Iland, some thr&eacute;e leagues distant, stood foure hillocks or rocks, &amp; for this Iland we bore vp a whole day, and a night, and finding it to be barren and vn|peopled, by sending our skiffe on shore, w&eacute;e passed by it, and the same day w&eacute;e espied thr&eacute;e Ilands more a|bout sunne setting standing in the height of 12. De|gr&eacute;es and 29. minutes, to which Ilands we came the 29. day of March, 1609. two of which Ilands were within a league one of another, and the third we found to be <HI>Sacatora,</HI> and standeth in 12. Degr&eacute;es and 24. minutes where we Ancored in a fine Bay the 30. day, in the morning about ten of the Clocke.</P>
<P>At sight of vs, the Ilanders made a fire, and w&eacute;e sent our skiffe an shore, but the people fled with great feare and trembling, hauing (as it s&eacute;emed) beene for|merly iniured by some that had passed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="20" REF="14">
our men looking about, found no likelie-hood of any re|l&eacute;efe there, and so came aboard and certified the Gene|rall thereof: so that about fiue of the clock in the after|noone, w&eacute;e waighed ancor, and sailed along to find out the chiefe harbor.</P>
<P>The 31. day we stood of into the main Sea, wher we met with a <HI>Guzarat</HI> ship, laden with Cotton woolls, Callicoes, and Pentathoes, b&eacute;eing bound for <HI>Adden,</HI> whether w&eacute;e kept her company, in regard they told vs it was a Towne of great trading, but w&eacute;e found it quite contrary: for it was onely a Towne of garison, and many Souldiers in it: and at the very entring in|to the Towne, is a Castle cut out of the maine, and incompassed round with the Sea, wherein are thirty two p&eacute;eces of Ordinance, and fiftie p&eacute;eces in the towne.</P>
<P>The 10. day of Aprill wee arriued there, and the <HI>Guzarat</HI> ship went into the Towne, and told the Go|uernour, there was an English Ship come to trade there. Who presently sent his Admirall to vs, and our Generall vnaduisedly went on shore, where h&eacute;e, and his fellowes were receiued with 4. great Horses, and were caried before the Gouernour, in as great pomp and state, as the Towne could y&eacute;eld. But the Gouernor finding him to be a plaine and simple man, put him in a house with a <HI>Chowse</HI> or k&eacute;eper, with ma|ny Ianyzaries or Souldiers to gard him, and so kept him prisoner sixe w&eacute;ekes, my selfe being prisoner with him.</P>
<P>And then the Gouernor caused him to send aboard for Iron, Tinne, and Cloath, to the value of 2500. Dollars, with promise to buy the same, which when he had on shore, h&eacute;e claimed and made stay thereof, for the Custome of the ship onely: and when hee saw hee had gotten as much as h&eacute;e could, hee sent him aboard the 27. day of May, and kept 2. of our Merchants for 2000. Dollars, which he said was for ancorage: but the ge|nerall
<PB N="21" REF="14">
voice of the company was, that hee should haue none: whereupon hee sent the Merchants vp into the Countrey some 8. daies iourney, to a place called <HI>Sia|ny</HI> where the Bashaw then lay.</P>
<P>The 28. day, our Pinnace came to vs, who told vs their Master was dead,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The master of the Pin|nace mur|dered.</HI></NOTE> and inquiring where, and how, the company told vs, he was knockt in the head with a Mallet hammer, by one <HI>Thomas Clarke,</HI> with the consent of <HI>Francis Driuer</HI> his mate, <HI>Andrew Euans,</HI> and <HI>Edward Hilles,</HI> beeing foure murderous and bad minded men, who beeing asked why, and vpon what occasion they did it, they could make no excuse, nor al|ledge any cause, saue onely, that hee had some small quantity of <HI>Aquauitae</HI> and <HI>Rosa solis,</HI> for his owne store, and for the good of them, or any one aboard, that should stand in n&eacute;ede thereof, and was prouident to k&eacute;epe and preserue the same, till great need should be, and therefore out of m&eacute;ere malice, and chieflie by the instigation of <HI>Francis Driuer</HI> his mate, they thus mur|dred an innocent man, who thought them no harme, nor suspected any such danger.</P>
<P>The 31. day of May, a Iury was called, and vpon iust and due proofe, according to our English lawes, they were conuicted, and <HI>Francis Driuer</HI> and <HI>Thomas Clarke</HI> were condemned and iudged to die, and were hanged in the Pinnace, where they did the fact: and on the other two, God shewed his iust iudgement after|wards. For <HI>Edward Hilles</HI> was eaten with Caribs or Man-eaters, and the other died and rotted where h&eacute;e lay.</P>
<P>The third day of Iune, w&eacute;e waighed ancor and sai|led into the Red-sea, thorow the straights of <HI>Mockoo</HI>; which are some league ouer from shore to shore, and 18 fathome water, close aboard the Iland shore, and a|bout 3. leagues in length.</P>
<P>When you are within the Straits, there lieth a great shole, some two leagues of into the Sea, and to

<P>It is a City of great trading for our Commodities: as Tynne, Iron, Lead, Cloth, Sword blades, and all English commodities. It hath a great Bussart or Market euery day in the w&eacute;eke. There is great store of fruit, as Apricocks, Quinces, Dates, Grapes a|bundance, Peaches, Limmons, and Plantins great store, which I much maruelled at, in regard rhe peo|ple of the Countrey told vs, they had no raine in seuen y&eacute;eres before, and yet there was very good Corne and good store, for eight&eacute;ene pence a bushell.</P>
<P>There are Oxen, Sh&eacute;epe, and Goats abundance: as an Oxe, for 3. Dollars, a Goat for halfe a Dollar, and a Sh&eacute;epe for halfe a Dollar: as much Fish for thr&eacute;e pence, as will suffise ten men to a meale. As Dol|phines, More-fish, Basse, Mullets, and other good Fish.</P>
<P>The Town is <HI>Arabian,</HI> and gouerned by the Turk, and if an Arabian offend, h&eacute;e is seuerely punished by their Law. For they haue Gallies and Chaines of purpose, which offenders are put into, else were they not able to keepe them in awe and subiection.</P>

that we might buy Water, Goats, and other prouisi|on, which h&eacute;e would not grant, because the women of the Country were much afraid: yet h&eacute;e told him, if h&eacute;e would goe to a Road some fiue leagues of, w&eacute;e should haue any thing his Countrey would afford: where we bought Goats, Water, aloes Socotrina, Dragons bloud, and what else the Countrey would afford.</P>
<P>H&eacute;ere at <HI>Sawb,</HI> w&eacute;e remaine from the 5. day of Au|gust, till the 18. day, and set saile with an ancor and a ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fe, for <HI>Cambaia.</HI> And on the 28. day of August, we came to <HI>Moa,</HI> where one of the Countrey people told vs that for the value of 20.

<P>The 29. day w&eacute;e set saile from thence, thinking to hit the Channell to goe to the bar, but w&eacute;e came out of 10. fathome water into 7. fathome, and into sixe fa|thome and a halfe. Then we tackt about to the West|ward, and came into 15. fathome, and then w&eacute;e tackt about againe to the Eastward, and came into 5. fa|thome water. Then some of the companie asked whe|ther the Master would goe, who answered let her go o|uer the height, and presently the ship strooke, which I presently went vp and told him of: who turning about asked who durst say sh&eacute;e strooke, then presently shee strooke againe, and strooke off her Rudder, and lost it in the Sea: then w&eacute;e came to an ancor, and rode there two daies, then our Skiffe split in p&eacute;eces, and we had no more but our long boat to helpe our selues withall: yet w&eacute;e made such shift, that w&eacute;e got the p&eacute;eces of our skiffe into the ship, and the Carpenter went so round<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to worke, that they had bound her vp together with woldings, so that when our greatest n&eacute;ed was, shee brought 16. men one shore.</P>

water in the Well, then we plied the pumpe, some foure houres, <HI>viz.</HI> from seuen of the Clocke to ele|uen of the Clocke at night, then the water encreased so fast that we were able to k&eacute;epe her no longer, but were forced to take our boats.</P>
<P>The Merchants had some 10000. l. lying betw&eacute;ene the maine Maste and the Stearidge, whereof the Ge|nerall bid the Company take what they would, and I thinke they tooke amongst them some 3000. pounds some hauing 100. pounds, some 50. pounds, some 40. pounds, some more, and some lesse, and so we left the ship, and tooke neither meat nor drinke with vs. And betw&eacute;ene twelue and one of the Clocke, w&eacute;e set saile to come ashore, which was at the least 20. leagues to the Eastward, and so we sailed all that night, and the next day, without any sustenance at all, till fiue or six of the Clocke at night, being the third day of Sep|tember, that we made the Land being a little Iland, standing vpon the bar, and then a gust came down vp|on vs, and brok the midship thought of our long boat, wherein were 55. persons, yet it pleased God that we recouered our Maste, and (the gust ceasing) we went ouer the barre,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">andeuee Riuer.</HI></NOTE> and got into the Riuer of <HI>Gandeuee.</HI></P>

<P>The 25. day of September, we tooke our iourney towards <HI>Surrot,</HI> to a Towne called <HI>Sabay,</HI> which is a Towne, only consisting of Spinners and Weauers, and there is much Calico made, and from thence w&eacute;e came to <HI>Surrate,</HI> where we found one <HI>William Finch</HI> an English Merchant, and seruant to Master <HI>Iohnson</HI> in <HI>Cheapside,</HI> who very curteously went to the Go|uernour, and acquainted him with our distresse, who (as hereafter we found it to be true) was bribed by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> which told him we were a kinde of turbule~t people that would make mutinies, and sow ciuill di|scention in the Towne, and so aduenture to surprise the Towne, whereupon we were put into a Monaste|ry, where we liued thr&eacute;e daies, nor could this suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, but we were remooued to a great house, being a <HI>Gen|tiles</HI> house, where we lay 14. daies; in which time, (by the good aduise of the said <HI>William Finch</HI>) we made pro|uision of Coaches, Horses, and other things to trauell to the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> &amp; certifie him of our great distresse and misfortunes.

<P>The 27. day, we trauelled 12. course and came to a City of the <HI>Bannions</HI> called <HI>Daytaotote,</HI> and there Master <HI>Reuet</HI> one of our Merchants died.</P>
<P>This City could neuer be conquored by the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> but y&eacute;elded vpon composition, and still holdeth his title of King of the <HI>Bannians,</HI> and at this City we stai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d two daies.</P>

<P>The <HI>Bannians</HI> are a strange people in their beliefe, and honour God in a strange fashion, <HI>viz.</HI> in pictures of stone, hanging their beades on the heades of the pictures, and then with their faces towards the sun doe worship it, saying, that all their comforts proceeds from it. And yet I saw more then this, which was a Cow adorned with a veste of gold and many Iewels, her head bedecked with garlands and flowers, and then being brought to a buriall place, where they doe vse to make Sermons, they kisse her f&eacute;et and teats, and worship her, that it grieued m&eacute;e to s&eacute;e their sond superstition, and abhominable Idolatry. And asking why they did it, they answered, that shee was the mo|ther of beasts, and brought them, milke, butter, ch&eacute;ese, and the Oxe to till the ground, and lastly, her hide did make leather to make them shooes. Moreouer, they say, she is blest by the Mother of God, to be honoured aboue all beasts. And so leauing the <HI>Bannians,</HI> wee crossed the Riuer of <HI>Tindee</HI> into the <HI>Gentiles</HI> Coun|trey.</P>
<P>Now at <HI>Saddisee,</HI> we being many, some in Coaches, some on Horseback, they thought we had come to take their Town, and did shut their gates, &amp; bent their Or|dinance vpon vs. But our General sent our Linguist or Interpreter to certifie them, what w&eacute;e were, and then the Gouernour opened the Gates, and came himself to entertaine vs with great curtesie and state. Yet that night we lay by the Riuer side, and the next day being the fifth of October, w&eacute;e came into the Towne, where we lay that night: And the next day we trauelled some 12.

<P>The Elephant serueth in the Field with a small tower of wood or timber vpon his back, wheron is pla|ced 4. p&eacute;eces of brasse as big as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">abnets, and 10. men very artificially placed in the said Tower, with bows and arrowes, and to discharge those p&eacute;eces.</P>
<P>The Elephants skin is musket proofe, vnlesse it be on his face and belly, and he is a beast of so great vn|derstanding, that he is ruled and gouerned by word of mouth, vnderstanding what his k&eacute;eper commandeth him to doe.</P>
<P>This Countrey beareth towards the Northwest, in the height of 28. Degrees, or thereabouts: And h&eacute;ere Muskets, Snaphances, Pistols, Petronels, and Swords, be good commodities, but no Firelocks in in any wise.</P>
<P>Also Cloth is an excellent commodity to my know|ledge, for I was offered thr&eacute;e pound for an old cloake, which h&eacute;ere, is not worth 20. shillings at the vtter|most.</P>
<P>And in Bramport we staied from the seuenth of O|ctober vntill the 11. of Nouember following: Then I and <HI>Iohn Frencham</HI> one of our Company went to craue the Generals passe, to goe to the great <HI>Mogol,</HI> but he asked vs if we would serue him in his warres, and he would giue vs what meanes we would desire: but we told him, we were poore distressed Merchants, that had beene shipwracked: and hee againe replied, that there was no Englishman, Merchant, nor other but he was a Souldier. But we told him that we had wiues and children in our Countrey, to whom wee must of necessity goe, to which h&eacute;e said, it was very well spoken, and that it was against their Lawes to

<P>An Elephant roiall being brought to remoue a piece of Ordinance of one and twenty foot long, which caried a shot of seuen inches high, and lay vpon the ca|riage on the side of a hill, and to carry the same some halfe furlong off; which he did as it s&eacute;emed to the great dislike of his K&eacute;eper, who told him hee was a lazy vil|laine, and deserued not his meat. Now the nature of the Elephant is, not to be disparaged in any thing, and standeth much vpon his reputation and valour: so that vpon these sp&eacute;eches of his K&eacute;eper, he came to it a|gaine, and with maine strength tore the carriage in pieces, and left the piece lying on the ground. Then were Carpenters set on worke to make a new carri|age, which being done, the same Elephant was broght, who clapt his Trunke about the wheeles, and brought the Ordinance where his K&eacute;eper commanded him.</P>
<P>This Citie is farre bigger then <HI>London,</HI> and great trade of all sorts of merchandise therein: it is one of the most famous heathen Cities that euer I came in, and the Citizens are very good and kind people, and very many Gallants in the Citie. Also fine riuers, ponds, orchards, gardens, pleasant walkes, and excel|lent faire prospects as euer I saw.

<P>Now in my iudgement, our English cloth of gold

and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">luer, veluets, broad-cloth, bayes, and cottons, would be very vendable, in regard there are so many Gallants. And thus much for the great City of <HI>Bram|port.</HI></P>
<P>The eleuenth of Nouember we took our iourny to+wards <HI>Agroe,</HI> I and <HI>Ioseph Salebanck</HI> our Purser, and one <HI>Io.

Also we had thought to haue gone along with a Carrauand of foure hundred and fifty strong, which were bound for <HI>Agro:</HI> but the Captaine told vs, that they were to stay seuen daies longer; but said, if w&eacute;e would trauel some two daies iourny (which we might safely doe without any danger of th&eacute;eues) we should meet with a greater Carrauand then they were.</P>
<P>So on the twelfth day, wee trauelled to a Towne called <HI>Caddor,</HI> some fift&eacute;ene course from thence, where we lay that night.</P>
<P>Heere the Gouernor hearing that wee were stran|gers, or Christians, demanded what we would haue, and whether we trauelled? We answered, to <HI>Agro,</HI> to the King, and that we came from <HI>Surrot.</HI> Then he as|ked vs what we would doe with the King? And when I heard him so inquisitiue, I peremptorily answered, that my businesse was too great for him to know: but he said, he would know it ere we went out of the Towne: and I againe replied, that my businesse was such, that I would goe out ot the Towne and aske him no leaue: and so making vs ready to depart, we said, we would s&eacute;e who would stay vs, without a very law|full occasion: Then the Gouernor sent his Cotwall or the Maior of the Towne, who asked vs why we vsed such peremptory sp&eacute;eches to the Gouernor? We told him, we answered him in no worse manner then his place and calling deserued, and that it was not for him to force vs to acquaint him with our businesse to the

King, and then we shewed him she Can Canawes passe to the King. Whereupon the Gouernor came to vs again with twenty Gentlemen of the Towne, and by all meanes intreated vs to stay all night, and what|soeuer w&eacute;e wanted that the Country could afford, should be at our seruice; and withall told vs, the way was dangerous, and very bad to trauell.</P>
<P>The next day we gaue him halfe a pound of Tobac|co for a present, which w&eacute;e brought out of England, which he accepted very thankfully.</P>
<P>The thirt&eacute;enth day w&eacute;e came to a Towne called <HI>Sawbon,</HI> some 14 course from <HI>Caddor,</HI> but before w&eacute;e were halfe a course out of the Towne, the Gouer|nour sent 12. Horsemen with Launces, Bowes and Arrowes, to conduct vs some part of the way that was most dangerous, which was some 10. or 12. English miles.</P>
<P>And when we came to <HI>Sawbon,</HI> we found the <HI>Car|rauand</HI> being 500. Camels bound for <HI>Agro.</HI> And were laden with Taffateis, wrought Silkes, Cloth, Sugar, and other Commodities, some from <HI>Bram|port,</HI> some from <HI>Bengalla,</HI> and some from <HI>Cambaia.</HI></P>
<P>The 14. day we set forwards with the <HI>Carrauand</HI>&punc; and trauelled some 12. course to a Monastery called <HI>Tindey.</HI></P>
<P>The 15. day, w&eacute;e trauelled some 10. course and lay in the woods.</P>
<P>The next day, we came to a great City called <HI>Can|nowe,</HI> where is much trading for Cloth, Swords, Shashes, P&eacute;eces, and Armour tied on with strings, being but onely Arrow proofe.</P>
<P>There is great store of fruit, and colours for Di|ars, of all sorts: and I thinke our English cloth would be an excellent commodity there: for it is very cold, es|specially in Ianuary February and March, for it bea|reth to the Northwards.</P>
<P>The 16. day we trauelled some 14 course to a great

<P>The <HI>Gentiles</HI> will eat nothing that bl&eacute;edeth, and the Sim is their great god, For, should they eat any thing that bl&eacute;edeth, they bel&eacute;eue that they may eat the soules of their Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, or friends, that are deceased? For, they say, that when any one dieth, their breath presently goeth into one beast or o|ther, &amp; so, in eating that beast, a man may eat the soule of some friend together with the flesh of that beast, such is their great bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndenesse and ignorance.

<P>The 17. day we came to the City of <HI>Gorra,</HI> where are many <HI>Surroyes,</HI> or Innes, where Trauellers may set their Camels, Horses or Catell, and cost nothing.</P>
<P>Also there are foure great Schooles for learning like to an Uniuersity: In this Countrey were two Brothers being Kings sonnes, who warred for this City, being eight miles in compasse, and in the mid|dle a great wall, and there they laid their S&eacute;edge, a long time. And at the last the King of the East part got the victory, and held the same for seuen y&eacute;eres, and then the great <HI>Mogol Tamberlaine</HI> the sixth ouercame the whole Countrey and tooke it into his hands.</P>

<P>The fourth day, we trauelled some 16. course to a Towne called <HI>Zaioberdee,</HI> where is hay, corne, and graine, great plenty.</P>
<P>The fifth day we trauelled some 18. course to a City called <HI>Handee,</HI> where the King hath a Castle and house, cut out of the maine Rocke, and wrought with carued worke round about. This Castle is inuincible, and hath fifty p&eacute;eces of Ordinance in it.</P>
<P>There lay in this Castle, when w&eacute;e were there 200. Knights, Captaines, and other Gallants, that had transgressed the Law, or the Kings commandement, as in Treason, Rebellion, and such like matters. Al|so, in this City are two houses much like Saint <HI>Iones,</HI> where Captaines and Cauiliers, that haue b&eacute;ene mai|med, and hurt in the warres, do liue, and haue each one a Mammoth&eacute;e a day being nine pence English, and meat and drinke at the Kings allowance.</P>
<P>The 6. day we came to the Riuer of <HI>Tamluo,</HI> which runneth into the Riuer <HI>Indus,</HI> which parteth the Coun|tries of the <HI>Pythagoreans,</HI> and the <HI>Indestands.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pithagoreans</HI> in former times haue b&eacute;ene a vile and treacherous kinde of people, and had a Law that when the husband died, the wife should be also burnt, which is holden till this day, though not in so strict a maner, for now sh&eacute;e may refuse it, but then
<PB N="35" REF="21">
her head is shauen and she clad in a blacke vesture or garment, which among them is reputed most vile and hatefull, that the basest slaue in the Countrey will not succor nor rel&eacute;eue her though she should starue.</P>
<P>Now, the cause why this Law was first made, was, for that the women there were so fickle and inconstant, that, vpon any slight occasion of dislike or spl&eacute;ene, they would poison their husbands. Whereas now the esta|blishing and executing of this Law, is the cause that moueth the wife to loue and cheerish her husband, and wisheth not to suruiue him.</P>
<P>As for example, I saw a young woman the wife of a Doctor, whose husband being dead, sh&eacute;e made choise to b&eacute;e carried in a Pageant, by foure men, shee being cloathed in Lawne, and her head deacked with Iewels and rich Ornaments, and before her went Musike of all sorts that the Countrey afforded, as Hoeboies, Drums, fifes, and Trumpets, and next vnto her all her kindred, and so sh&eacute;e was brought to the place of Execution, where was a stake and a hole to set her f&eacute;et in, and so being tied to the stake, all her kindred kn&eacute;eling round about her, &amp; praying to the sun and their other Idols, the fire was set to her, she ha|uing vnder each arme a bagge of gunpowder, and a bagge betwixt her legges, and so burnt to death, the fire being made of Beniamin, Storare, Lignomal l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and other sw&eacute;et woods.

<P>The eight day, w&eacute;e trauelled some 26. course, and came to the great City of <HI>Agro</HI> where the great <HI>Mo|goll</HI> k&eacute;epeth his Court and residence.</P>
<P>The ninth day Captaine <HI>Hawkins</HI> came to vs, and brought vs before the King, as it is the custome and manner of the Countrey. For no stranger must stay a|boue twenty foure houres before he be brought before the King to know what h&eacute;e is, and wherefore h&eacute;e com|meth

Also euery stranger must present the King with some present, b&eacute;e it neuer so small, which h&eacute;e will not refuse.

Also I gaue him the picture of Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> head cut in Amber and Gold, which h&eacute;e also re|ceiued very gratiously.</P>
<P>The whistle h&eacute;e gaue to one of his great women, and the picture to <HI>Sultane Caroone</HI> his yongest sonne. His eldest son rebelled, and is in prison with his eies sea|led vp, and it is noised amongst the common people that his eies are put out: But it was told m&eacute;e by a great man, that they are but sealed vp.

abroad: for at home none attend him but Euenu|ches or gelded men.</P>
<P>His Lord chiefe Iustice is an Euenuch, and is cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">led, <HI>Awlee Nawbob</HI>: h&eacute;e is thought to b&eacute;e woorth twen+ty English millions: H&eacute;e k&eacute;epeth twenty Elephants, one hundreth and fifty Camels and Dromedaries, and fiue hundreth Horse to attend on him.</P>
<P>The Lord Treasurer is a mighty man, called <HI>Sul|tan Carowdon</HI>: H&eacute;e hath forty Elephants to attend him, two hundreth Camels and Dromedaries, and one thousand Horse at his seruice. And when he com|meth to sit in his place of Iustice, h&eacute;e is brought vpon an Elephant clad in cloth of gold or siluer, and some|times in a Pollankan, carried by foure slaues, he lying in it, as if h&eacute;e lay in a cradle, in as great pomp and ease as may b&eacute;e, and hath four maces of siluer and gilt car|ried before him, and ten banners, and as great atten|dance, as if hee were a King; yet on Twesdaies and Thursdaies the King himselfe sits in Iudgement of all causes: He custometh all strangers goods himselfe, the custome beeing but small at his pleasure, as some|times, the value of ten shillings, custometh goods worth two hundreth pound. Also if a Merchant stran|ger, bring wares or merchandize from a farre Coun|trey: as from <HI>Chyna, Bengalla,</HI> and thinketh h&eacute;e shall make a bad voiage, or lose thereby: if h&eacute;e acquaint the King therewith, and that the merchandize b&eacute;e fit for Kings, Princes, and Noble men, the King himselfe will take part thereof, and cause his Nobles to take the rest, at such rates as the Merchant, shall not only b&eacute;e a sauer, but a great gainer thereby.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogoll,</HI> lyueth in as great state and pompe as may be deuised, both for Maiestie and princely pleasure; for hee had brought before him euery day during our a|bode there, 50. Elephants royall, clad in cloth of golde and siluer, with drums fifes and trumpets, whereof, some fight one with another, wounding one another ve|ry
<PB N="38" REF="23">
deadly, and cannot be parted but with Rackets of wilde fier, made round like hoopes, and so run the same in their faces, and some of them fight with wilde horses, as one Elephant with 6. horses, whereof he hath killed 2. in|stantly by clasping his trunck about their neckes, and so pulling them to him, with his teeth breaketh their necks.</P>
<P>Also there are tame Elephants that will take the vi|ceroyes sonnes being the Kings pages with their truncks, gaping as they would eat them, and yet verie gently will set them vpon his owne head, and hauing sit|ten there a good space, will set them downe againe one their f&eacute;et as tenderly as a mother would set downe her owne childe, doing them no harme at all.</P>
<P>The Elephant wil not goe out of the sight of his fe|male, nor will he be ruled if he doe, this I can speake by experience hauing s&eacute;ene triall made thereof, Also euery he Elephant, hath 3. or 4. females, and I saw one that had 4. females and 12. yong ones of his owne begetting.</P>
<P>There ingendring together is strange, for the female lieth downe on her backe, and he commeth vpon her, and so ingender. But if he perceiue any man to beholde or s&eacute;e him thus ingendring hee will kill him if he can.</P>
<P>Also the King hath Deare, Rammes, Ueruathoes or Beazors, Lyons, Leopards, and Wolues, that fight be|fore him. Also if a Cauilier be condemned for any of|fence and iudged to die, he may by the custom of the Coun|try, Craue combate with a Lion for his life, (which the King denieth to none that crave it) as for example, I saw one, that at the first incounter strooke the Lion with his fist that he felled him, but the Lion recouering, returned with great furie and violence, and caught such hold on him that he rent out his guts, with the heart and liuer and so tore him in peeces, and this was performed before the King.</P>
<P>Also there are horses that fight with Allegators or Crocodiles in Tancks or ponds of water where I also
<PB N="39" REF="23">
saw one Allegator kill 2. stone horses at one time. There is also a faire Riuer called <HI>Indawe,</HI> running from thence to <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> &amp; carrieth boats or lighters of 40. tun, and is replenished with fish of all sorts.</P>
<P>Also there are 4. Basars or markets euery day in the weeke, and great store of all things to be bought and sold there, and at a very reasonable rate. As a hen for 2. pence, a Turkey for 6. pence, a liue deare for a dollar, a sheep for 2. shillings, a goat for 2. shillings, a couple of oxen for 4. dollars&punc; being 16. shillings sterling, a good hogge for 2. shil|lings, but none buy them but Christians, and none sell them but the Bannyans, who breed them, and as much fish for 3. pence as will serue 5. reasonable men at a meale.</P>
<P>Also great store of fruit, as Limmons, Oranges, Apri|cocks, Grapes, Peares, Apples and Plummes; But with their grapes they make no wines because their lawes forbid it: Also Raisons as great and faire as Raisons of Damasko, with great store of cloth of golde veluets and silkes out of <HI>Persia,</HI> and silkes and cloth of gold from <HI>Chyna,</HI> but those are course and lowe prised; but abundance are their vended; and Captaine <HI>Haw|kins</HI> thinketh that our Richer silkes, veluets, and such like would be excellent good commodities there.</P>
<P>But especially our Cloth of light coulors. For there is no Cloth, but a kind of course Cloth like Cotton, which is made at <HI>Lyhore,</HI> and at a Towne called <HI>Esmeere:</HI> and their finest and best, is a kind of course red cloth, like a Uenice red, and this is the vsuall wearing for the chief|est Cau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">liers; and these are all the places of clothing that I could by any meanes heare of in all that Country.</P>
<P>The word <HI>Mogoll,</HI> in their language is as much as to say, the great white King; for he is a white man and of the Race of the Tartares. He is King of many King|domes, and writeth himselfe in his scile&punc; <HI>Patteshaw Shel|ham Sho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> that is, the King of all the great coynes.

Also he writeth himselfe the nynthe King from <HI>Tamberlaine.</HI> And to this his great stile he is also of as great power, wealth and commande, yet will he vrge none of what Nation soeuer to forsake their Re|ligions, but esteemeth any man somuch the better, by how much the more he is firme and constant in his Re|ligion, and of all other he maketh most accompt of Chri|stians, and will allow them double the meanes that hee giueth to any other nation, and keepeth continually two Christians Friars, to conuerse with them in the Christi|an Religion and manners of Christendome. He hath also the picture of our Lady in the place of his praier or Religious proceedings, and hath oftentimes said that he could find in his heart to be a Christian, if they had not so many Gods: There was at my being there an Armenian Christian that in hope of gaine and prefer|ment turned More, which being told the King, he saide, if he thought to saue his soule thereby, that was a suffi|cient Recompence for him, but he would rather haue giuen him preferment if he had kept himselfe still a Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stian.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogoll</HI> is also verie bountifull, for to one that gaue him a little deere he gaue 1000. Ruckees, being 100. pound sterling, also to another that gaue him a cou|ple of land spannels, he gaue the like reward, and to ano|ther that gaue him two Cocks he gaue 2000. Ruck&eacute;es.</P>
<P>Also there be excellent faire Hawkes of all sorts from the Goshauke to the Sparehauke, and great store of game, as Phesants, Partriges, Plouers, Quailes, Mallard, and of all other sorts of fowle in great plentie.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="24">There are no great dogges but a kind of Mungrels, whereof two wil hardly kill a deare in a whole day, and yet they are so choise ouer them, that they make them coates to keepe them warme and cleane.

<P>The King hath there begun a goodly monument for his Father, which hath been already 9. yeeres in buil|ding, and will hardly be finished in 5. yeeres more, and yet there are continually 5000. workemen at worke thereon.</P>
<P>The substance therof, is very fine marble, curiously wrought.</P>
<P>It is in forme 9. square, being 2. English miles a|bout and 9. stories in height.</P>
<P>Also, it was credibly reported vnto me by a Christian Friar (who solemnly protested he heard the King him selfe speake it) that hee intended to bestow a hundreth millions of Treasure on that monument.</P>
<P>And hauing viewed and seen this great and rich Ci|tie of <HI>Agra</HI> with the pleasures and Commodities there|of; on the 18. day of <HI>Ianuarie,</HI> my selfe with <HI>Ioseph Sale|bancke</HI> and <HI>Iohn Frencham,</HI> went to the King and cra|ued his Passe for <HI>England,</HI> who very courteously de|ma~ded of vs, if we would serue him in his wars, offering vs what maintenance we would aske of him; which wee humbly excused&punc; both in regard of this our voiage, wher|in diuers others besids our selues, were partners, as also, in regard we had Wiues and Children in our owne Countrie, to whom both by Law and Nature, wee were bound to make returne, if it were possible; whereupon most graciously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e granted vs his Passe, vnder his hand and great Seale, for our safe conduct thorow al his King|domes and Dominions.

And this Qu&eacute;ene is k&eacute;eper of his great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eale, where it was sealed and deliuered vnto vs. Then I also went to the chiefe Friar, and craued his let|ters, aswell to the Kings and Princes, whose Kingdoms and Dominions we were to passe thorow, as also to the Clergy and places of Religion, which he most willingly granted, b&eacute;eing a man of great Credit there, and greatly esteemed and well knowne in other Kingdomes.</P>
<P>Also hee gaue me his letters of commendations to one <HI>Iohn Midnall</HI> an English Merchant or Factor, who had lien in Agroe three yeeres: but before I came into Eng|land <HI>Iohn Midnall</HI> was gone againe for the East Indies, and I deliuered his letter to <HI>M^r.

<P>The 14. day we went 4. leagues to a Castle called <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssebaw,</HI> and rested that night, and the next day we trauelled 12. leagues more and at night came to <HI>Nus|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">baw,</HI> where the Prophet <HI>Ionas</HI> preached to all the Countries round about; and there remaineth his pic|ture in stone though much defaced by the warres yet it is kept and maintained by the Christians, whereof there are many dispersed amongst the <HI>Turkes,</HI> euer

<P>The 20. day we tooke our iourney towards a towne called <HI>Goubba</HI> being 25. leagues and 3. daies iourney, and came thither the 22. day at night, where we met with a <HI>Consul</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> and 5. <HI>Venetians</HI> more, trauel|ling to <HI>Bugdad</HI> or <HI>Babilon,</HI> and there we staied a day and a night.</P>

<P>The 6. day we were ferried ouer the Riuer and went 2. daies iourney being soule 15. leagues to the Towne of <HI>Lumman,</HI> and came thither on the 7. day at night.</P>
<P>The 8. day we trauelled 10. leagues to the City of

<HI>Aleppo,</HI> and came thither that night, and by the waie, we trauelled 2. leagues thorough the plaines, where was nothing but figs, or as I may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">earme it a forest of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ig trees, and another place of as great length, being all v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne tr&eacute;es, full of grapes.</P>

<P><HI>Aleppo</HI> is a City of wonderfull great trading and as well knowne to <HI>England</HI> or at lest to our English Merchants&punc; as Kingstone vpon Thames.

<P>The twenty eight day we went some tenne leagues to a lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le Towne called <HI>Hone,</HI> and lay there that night.</P>
<PB REF="36" N="64">
<P>The 29. day, we trauelled to <HI>Tripolis,</HI> being tenne leagues from thence, where we found the good ship, the <HI>Great Exchange of London,</HI> whereof Master <HI>Ro|bert Bradshawe</HI> of <HI>Ratliffe</HI> was both Captaine and Master; who not aboue ten daies before, was in great danger of shipwrake breaking their Cables and An|cors, so that the ship droue and was in great distresse: So that they were faine to cut the maine Mast ouer|bord, being within twice the ships length of the rocks, yet by Gods good prouidence, one Cable and Ancor held, and so both schip and men were saued, all the men hauing stripped themselues to saue their lives by swimming, or otherwise, as it would please God to as|sist and permit them.</P>
<P>In this storme there was a great <HI>Venetian</HI> shippe of 1100. tun cast away, yet the ship was so set amongst the Rocks, that all her men were saued by the great and mercifull prouidence of almighty God.</P>
<P>Also there were Frenchmen in the Harbor, that cut ther Masts ouerbord and were in great danger, yet all escaped thankes be giuen to God.</P>
<P>Also afterwards by greawt good fortune the Excharges Mast was found by the company between two Rocks, and was got on shore, and hauing an excellent good Carpenter, he did workemanlike and strongly scarse the same with a p&eacute;ece of an other Mast, which the Master got from aboard a <HI>Flemming,</HI> that it brough her well home into <HI>England,</HI> God be praised.</P>
<P>At our comming to <HI>Tripolie</HI> we went to the English house, where w&eacute;e stayed two daies, and were by him very knidly used, and h&eacute;ere we ended our long and teious Land trauels.</P>
<P>The first day of Ianuary being New y&eacute;eres day, we tooke our leaue of Master <HI>Lucas</HI> and went aboard, my selfe and <HI>Richard Martin,</HI> where Captaine <HI>Bradshawe</HI>
<PB REF="36" N="65">
also used us very kindly, and in regard I was very weake, with long and extreame trauell, he allowed me a good Cabin, and caused the Surgeon to deo mee what good he could.</P>
<P><HI>Tripoly</HI> is a Towne of no great traffique, but only a place whither ships doe come to take in such trading as is brought from other places, and chiefly from <HI>Aleppo.</HI></P>
<P>The cause (I thinke) is by reason of the dangerous harbour there. For if there come Easterly windes that ouerblow, there is no safe riding for ships in that harbour. For that no reasonable ground takle will hold them.</P>
<P>The third day of Ianuary, we set saile for <HI>England,</HI> and the one and twentieth day following we came to the Iland of <HI>Zante,</HI> where they tooke in thr&egrave;e months victuals, which they left there, when there were out|ward bound.</P>
<P>Also they tooke in Oiles and Currants, being all the Commodities, which the Iland affordes. For of it self it is so poore and barren, that it y&egrave;eldeth not victuals to maintaine it self, but is for the most part maintained from the Maine.</P>
<P>The foure and twentieth day we set saile againe, and about he foure and twentieth day of February the winde tooke us short, and our Master thinking it not goo dto beat the ship at Sea with a contrary winde, put into harbour at <HI>Malta,</HI> where is a gal|land harbour, and many gallies and pretty fine ship|ping belonging to the same, which goe out upon ser|uice 200. against the Turke.</P>
<P><HI>Malta</HI> is a goodly City of an inuincible strength, with gallant wals being built vpon a maine Rocke. And vpon the wals of the olde and new towne, are p&eacute;eces of excellent good brasse Ordinance.</P>
<P>And in this City the ancient order of the knights of
<PB N="66" REF="37"><HI>Malta,</HI> haue their continuall residence, who are gallant souldiers, &amp; haue faire houses, not much vnlike to our Innes of Court, they are all Christians, and so are all the inhabitants, viz.</P>
<P><HI>Armenians, Spaniards, Italians, Dutchmen,</HI> and verie many <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> the <HI>Grand</HI> Master of the whole order being a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> but I could not heare of any <HI>Eng|lish</HI> amongst them, yet doe they all, shew themselues very kind, and curteous to <HI>Englishmen.</HI></P>
<P>All the knights doe weare white and blacke crosses on the shoulders of their cloakes: And any gentleman that commeth thither doth put in a stocke of a 100. pound or thereabouts, for his maintainance, but is not allowed for a knight, vntil by seruice against the <HI>Turke</HI> or else where he shall deserue the same, and h&eacute;ere w&eacute;e staied 5. daies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Somewhat is wanting.</HI></NOTE>The 10. day of <HI>March,</HI> we set saile againe, and about the 22. day we came to a watch house where was 2. p&eacute;e|ces of Ordinance, and came to an ancor, but because we came not presently ashore with our boat, they shot at vs, whereupon our Captaine sent our boat on shore with our <HI>Boatswaine,</HI> who was very kindly vsed, when they knew what we were, and the Captaine of the watch-house came aboard our ship, &amp; gaue our captaine a liue hog for a present, which he accepted very thank|fully, and requited him with other things of 3. times the value.</P>

<P>Then our purser and my selfe with a knight of <HI>Mal|ta,</HI> being a passenger for <HI>France,</HI> were by our Boat|swaine and his gang set on shore, together with the Captaine of the watch-house, we thinking to goe to the Towne of <HI>Callar,</HI> to buy such prouision as we wan|ted: But the Captain tooke our Purser and the knight of <HI>Malta</HI> prisoners, and kept them there: So that our Master not knowing how to come by y^e Purser, waigh|ed

<P><HI>Calarie</HI> is a great Towne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Callari a Towne of Sardinia.</HI></NOTE> where a number of Ca|uiliers doe liue, and hath some small shipping belong|ing to it.</P>
<P>It standeth in the Iland of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> which is a great and fruitfull Iland of corns and fruit, where we lay some sixe daies, and 5. or 6. daies more of and on, about the Iland: In which tune we discribed two small men of warre, which we imagined to be some of Cap|taine <HI>Wards</HI> crew, who at the first chased vs, and then we had them in chase, but whe~ they perceiued we were not for their turne, they made away, as fast as they could, and so we left them.</P>
<P>Then it pleased God to send vs a wind, that brought vs thorow the <HI>Leuant,</HI> and put vs out to the mouth of the <HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>Gebraltar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Strait of Gibral|tar.</HI></NOTE> from whence we also had a faire winde that carried vs to the height of the <HI>Burlans,</HI> which is off the Rocke going to <HI>Lisbone</HI> in <HI>Portugale,</HI> where the winde tooke vs short: So that our Captaine thought it best to put into <HI>Cast Cales,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Berelen|gas.</HI></NOTE> for beating the ship in the sea, which he did for 23. or 4 daies, vntill it pleased God to send vs a faire winde, and so putting to sea againe we arriued safe in <HI>England</HI> at the Town and port of <HI>Douer</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Douer.</HI></NOTE> about the latter end of <HI>Aprill,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1611.</NOTE> 1611.</P>

<P>For to m&eacute;e, all the Nations and kingdomes, that in this my trauels I passed by and saw, both by sea and land, s&eacute;emed nothing comparable to it.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="38">But that in respect of them all, it may be called the onely <HI>Paradize</HI> and blessed Countrey of the world.</P>
<P>And so desiring God of his mercy to blesse euery good man from so great miseries as w&eacute;e indured by the follies and ouersight of a lewd and indiscreet Ma|ster, being both vnfit and vnworthy to bee imploied in so great affaires, and for so worshipfull and worthy men as were Masters, Owners, and Aduenturers therein.</P>
