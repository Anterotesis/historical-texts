<HEAD>An Exact Relation of the GLORIOUS VICTORY Obtain'd upon the French and Iri&s;h Army BEFORE LONDON-DERRY, On <HI>Sunday, June</HI> the 2d, 1689. WITH An Account of Major-General <HI>KIRK</HI>'s Arrival at <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and the Number of Ships under his Command.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Li&s;enced and Entred according to Order.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>THE Letters from <HI>Dublin</HI> &s;ay, That all Artifices are u&s;ed to bring over the Prote|&s;tants, to e&s;pou&s;e the late King's Intere&s;t, but they are ineffectual, which is evident, for that there are in <HI>Ireland</HI> many thou&s;and Prote|&s;tants, of which a great number are able to bear Arms, and among&s;t them very many good Officers; yet hath not the late King &s;ince his Arrival in that Kingdom, with all his gilded offers of Protection, and Liberty of Con&s;cience, been able to prevail with Twenty Men of the Reformed Religion, to take up Arms for Defence of his Popi&s;h Cau&s;e, or a&s;&s;i&s;t to en&s;lave their Po&s;terities.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> already behave them&s;elves with that haughty In&s;olence in the Court, Camp, and Coun|trey, as if they were entering on the Meritorious Service (as at home) of Dragooning the defence|le&s;s Prote&s;tants, and Lording it over the Native <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> in&s;omuch, that their Biggotry and Loyalty begins to &s;tagger, and the wi&s;er and wealthier of them think they are a&s;&s;i&s;ting a Fatal Work to their Po&s;terity, and Countrey, wi&s;hing them&s;elves under a Prote&s;tant Protection again; the godly Mon&s;ieur &s;tick not to &s;ay publickly, that <HI>Ireland</HI> cannot be ble&s;&s;ed until there is not one damned Heretick left a|live in the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Upon a mode&s;t Calculation, the Papi&s;t Army and Mobile, together, have already de&s;poiled the Prote|&s;tants of their per&s;onal E&s;tates in Money, Plate, Stock, and Hou&s;hould-Goods, to the value of more than five hundred thou&s;and Pounds Sterling; and the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed in each County for Se|que&s;trations, have &s;eque&s;tred more than five hun|dred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> of their real E|&s;tates, and are proceeding therein.</P>
<P>And Orders are given for the &s;eizing to the u&s;e of the late King what remains unplundered in the Hou|&s;es of all Prote&s;tants Ab&s;enters; and the pretended Hou&s;e of Commons have unanimou&s;ly voted the Re&s;titution of all Lands belonging to Abbeys, Prio|ries, Mona&s;teries, and all other Religious Hou&s;es throughout the Kingdom, which makes the Prie&s;ts, Fryars, Monks, and the order of that di&s;orderly Crew to appear in &s;uch Herd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> as if they were upon a General Mu&s;ter, and the numbers of Ma&s;&s;es for Suc|ce&s;s is incredible; but it's a Que&s;tion among them|&s;elves whether mo&s;t are offered for the <HI>French</HI> King, or his Lieutenant.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e their <HI>Halcyon</HI> hopes, the di&s;&s;atis|faction which appears in the mo&s;t con&s;iderate of the Natives, the unanimous proceedings in <HI>England,</HI> the firmne&s;s and &s;wift proceedings in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Re&s;olution of the Garri&s;ons of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and <HI>Inniskilling,</HI> who&s;e Courage hath de&s;troyed the flower of their Army, &amp; di&s;couraged the re&s;t, who con|fe&s;t they have lo&s;t before <HI>Derry,</HI> and el&s;ewhere 10000 Hor&s;e, Foot, and Dragoons mo&s;t killed, &s;ome wounded, &s;ome taken, and &s;ome de&s;erted. And it's
<PB N="2" REF="2">credited at <HI>Dublin,</HI> that the Siege is rai&s;ed, and the rather, for that &s;ome harra&s;&s;ed Troops of Hor&s;e (&s;ome wanting above half their number) are come thither from before <HI>Derry,</HI> and are ordered to joyn the Camp that is forming near <HI>Dublin,</HI> and there to be filled up, whiles Recruits are marching to the Northward, to Reinforce the Army.</P>
<P>The Account credited at <HI>Dublin</HI> concerning the late Action near <HI>Bally&s;hannon</HI> is, That there are in <HI>Inniskilling</HI> 4000 Foot well Arm'd, and above 1000 Hor&s;e, of as brave &s;tout Men from the Northern Borders of both Kingdoms, as any are in <HI>Europe,</HI> and commanded by Col. <HI>William Hamilton,</HI> Capt. <HI>King|&s;ton,</HI> and many other brave Officers, who have made frequent and &s;ucce&s;sful Sallies upon the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> particularly in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, upon the Occa&s;ion follow|ing.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of <HI>Inniskilling</HI> having gotten together a great Stock of Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts at <HI>Bally&s;hannon,</HI> which they de&s;igned to get thither by Water; the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> got Notice thereof, and with a &s;trong Party of 12, &s;ome &s;ay 1500 Hor&s;e and Dragoons, com|manded by Col. <HI>Sarsfield,</HI> re&s;olved to make them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters thereof, and were on their March ac|cordingly. But Col. <HI>Hamilton</HI> drew out of the Town all the Hor&s;e he had, and a con&s;iderable Bo|dy of Foot, and Attaqued them &s;o Opportunely, and with that Courage and Re&s;olution, that they were &s;oon forced in Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion, and the Foot coming up and &s;ecuring a Pa&s;s, the whole Party was entirely defeated, <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and five or &s;ix more nar|rowly e&s;caping, the re&s;t being mo&s;t killed, and about 200 taken, the be&s;t of which they kept, and the re&s;t they &s;tript and &s;ent away to carry the News to their Friends. In this Action they got many good Hor&s;es, Arms, and Plunder, and have gotten home their Provi&s;ions; &s;ince which, at a place called <HI>Kil|ley-Shani,</HI> they attaqued and routed a Detachment that was marching to the Army, and took from them &s;ome Cannon and Bombs, 100 Pri&s;oners, and as many killed; of both which Actions they have gi|ven an Account to <HI>Derry,</HI> and that they are in good Heart, and, if po&s;&s;ible, will joyn them in a few days, and take the Field with what Forces they can make, and bring Provi&s;ions with them.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> &s;ay, That on the <HI>31st.</HI> pa&s;t, about 3 in the Morning, the Wind at South-Ea&s;t, a brisk Gale, Major-Gen. <HI>Kirk</HI> failed from <HI>High Lake,</HI> having with him 3 Men of War, and 24 Ships of Bur|then, on whom are Embarqued the Major-General's Regiment, Sir <HI>John Hanmore</HI>'s, and Col. <HI>Stewart</HI>'s, and the re&s;t of the Forces, with Gunners, Engineers, and a great quantity of Provi&s;ions, Arms, Ammunition, Bombs, Cannon, Morters, Ball, Pick-axes, and Sho|vels.</P>
<P>La&s;t Night, being <HI>June</HI> the Fifth, came an Advice from <HI>Liverpool,</HI> &s;ent in there by the <HI>Portland-Frigate,</HI> with the account fol|lowing, <HI>viz.</HI> That being crui&s;ing on the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t, &s;he met with Major-General <HI>Kirk</HI> on <HI>Saturday</HI> the fir&s;t in&s;tant, at Ten in the Mor|ning off of <HI>Carrick-Fergus</HI> Bay, with the whole Fleet, under a good Wind for <HI>London-Derry,</HI> where they in all probability arrived on Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>There is certain Advice from <HI>London-Derry,</HI> That the Prote&s;tants in <HI>London-Derry</HI> having Notice on Sabbath-day Morning, <HI>June</HI> the Se|cond, that Major-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> and the Fleet under his Command, were arrived within the Harbour's Mouth, called a Council of War, and re&s;olved to make a Sally on the Enemy; which they executed with all the whole Force of the Garri&s;on (about a thou|&s;and Men excepted) and with that de&s;perate Courage and Re&s;olution, that they fell pell-mell upon the Enemy in their Trenches, and beat them off from their Three Batteries, and out of all their Trenches, took all their Mortars and Guns: And &s;o bloody and ob|&s;tinate was the Fight, that the Prote&s;tants lo&s;t about 1500 Men, and the Enemy 6000, &s;ome account 5000, but the lea&s;t above 4000 dead on the &s;pot.</P>
<P>After which the Enemy di&s;camped with their whole Army in a very great di&s;order and confu&s;ion, leaving behind them all their Bag and Baggage, of which the Prote&s;tants are now the Ma&s;ters, and of the Field eight Miles round.</P>
<P>This Good News is brought by the <HI>Dublin</HI> Yatch, Captain <HI>Rice</HI> Commander, who went with Major-General <HI>Kirk</HI> to <HI>Derry,</HI> and left them in the Harbour on Sabbath-day night, intending to land on <HI>Munday</HI> Mor|ning. The Particulars of this Great and Glorious Action is expected next Po&s;t from <HI>Derry,</HI> with the true &s;tate of the Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Letters from <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> do affirm, That ye&s;terday, <HI>June</HI> the Fifth, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of Forty Ships of War, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> came to the <HI>Spitt-head,</HI> where the reciprocal Joy and Friend&s;hip of each Fleet, was loudly proclaimed by their Cannon.</P>
