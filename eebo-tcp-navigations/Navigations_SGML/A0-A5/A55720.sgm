<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF Jamaica.</HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>Jamaica</HI> in <HI>America</HI> is Situated in about 182 North Latitude, in the Sea called <HI>Mare Del Nort;</HI> it lies about 140 Leagues North of the Main Continent of <HI>America,</HI> South from the great I&s;land of <HI>Cuba</HI> about 15 Leagues, and from <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> We&s;t about 20 Leagues.</P>
<P>The I&s;land is of an Oval Form, and lies due Ea&s;t and We&s;t, having a continued Ridge of lofty Moun|tains
<PB N="2" REF="7"> running from one end to the other. By the Map and Survey which Sir <HI>Thomas Lynch</HI> took, it's above 150 Miles long, and from 25 to 50 Miles broad, <HI>de plano,</HI> and contains four Millions and a half of Acres; it's imagined, if this I&s;land were divided into eight parts, one is Excellent Pa&s;turage, called by the <HI>Indians Savannas,</HI> 4/8 good Plantable Land, &frac38; Barren or unplantable.</P>
<P>In the Year 1675, when Sir <HI>Tho|mas Lynch</HI> left the Government, there was above 900000 Acres pa&s;s'd and Planted, and to Manure and Culti|vate it about 30000 of all &s;orts of People.</P>
<P>This I&s;land is not generally &s;o Fer|tile and proper for Sugar as <HI>Barba|does</HI> has been, the Soyl being ex|treamly differing; for in &s;ome parts 'tis a black fat Earth, and in others &s;tiff and Clayie, in others Sandy, and in &s;ome Reddi&s;h, but by pareels; it's therefore the Settlements are di|&s;tinct,
<PB N="3" REF="7"> Mountainous, and Unplant|able Land interpo&s;ing betwixt them make them appear like &s;o many &s;e|veral Colonies, and has occa&s;ioned this Divi&s;ion of the Pari&s;hes, St. <HI>Thomas</HI> at the Ea&s;t, St. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> at the We&s;t, St. <HI>Johns</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas in the Vale.</HI> In the I&s;land, St. <HI>Georges,</HI> St. <HI>Maries,</HI> and St. <HI>Anns,</HI> the North &s;ide: St. <HI>Davids,</HI> St. <HI>Andrews, Port Royal,</HI> St. <HI>Catharines,</HI> St. <HI>Dorothies, Clarendon</HI> and <HI>Vere</HI> on the South &s;ide. The greate&s;t Plains, and almo&s;t all the <HI>Savannas</HI> or Pa&s;turage is on the South &s;ide; they are all taken up and Stock'd with Cattel; on the South &s;ide likewi&s;e is <HI>Port Royal</HI> and all the be&s;t Ports and Roads, and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Plantations, this &s;ide being dry, plain, more agreeable, and much quicker and &s;afer Coa&s;t than the North, for that in the Spring is apt to violent Gu&s;ts of Winds, and much more &s;ubject to Rains than the South, as the Ea&s;t,
<PB N="4" REF="8"> and all Parts is that is Woody and Mountainous; nor has the North &s;ide any &s;afe Port, but <HI>Port Antonio,</HI> to the Wind-ward, which is &s;ubject to violent and con&s;tant Rains, and the Land about it Mor&s;ey and Moun|tainous, &s;o no Settlements are near it. The other Lee-ward Pari&s;hes have <HI>Port St. Maries,</HI> that is Rea&s;o|nably good and &s;afe, but they have (e&s;pecially in St. <HI>Maries</HI> Pari&s;h) abundance of Excellent Plantations of <HI>Coccoa,</HI> many Sugar-works, and Provi&s;ion Plantations that are &s;up|ported and carried on by Hunting and gathering <HI>Pimento,</HI> with which this Quarter abounds. Thus Plan|tations were begun, and the Govern|ment &s;ettled in Sir <HI>Thomas Lynch</HI> his time, and now the Inhabitants find the goodne&s;s of that Soyl Liberally Recompence the want of Harbours and Pa&s;turage, and di&s;tance from the Chief Port and Seat of Govern+ment, for its very Fertile Land
<PB N="5" REF="8"> covered with Excellent Timber; it's a little Hilly, but full of fine Rivers, and all Conveniencies for Plantations.</P>
<P>The Climate is as agreeable as any can be betwixt the Tropicks, the Air being very &s;erene and clear, even to a Proverb among the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> It's &s;ubject to Thunder and Light|ning, as all Countries in that Lati|tude are; the Rains come uncer|tainly, but mo&s;t expected about <HI>November</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> they are gene|rally violent, continue an uncertain time, are unhealthy, and breed <HI>Mus|ketoes,</HI> that are the greate&s;t Plague in the I&s;land, but are trouble&s;om only the Rainy Sea&s;ons, and in mo&s;t places where they have not good Hou&s;es, a free Air, clean Yards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

The South Part dry, plain, very plea&s;ant, abound|ing with Ports and Pa&s;turage.

<PB N="8" REF="10">
<P>The Winter Months here have only the Nights, Mornings and Eve|nings cooler, the Days as hot as Summer, and about fifteen Hours long Winter and Summer.</P>
<P>The Winds blow not an hours variation commonly here as they do every where betwixt the Tro|picks, that is Ea&s;terly, which they call Bree&s;es, near the I&s;land they ri&s;e not till about Nine in the Morning, and u&s;ually cea&s;e at about &s;ix or &s;even at Night; they come in gently, and grow as the Sun ri&s;es, and in the Evening comes in a kind of We&s;ternly Wind, which we call Land-bree&s;e, becau&s;e it blows off the Land, and with it the Ve&s;&s;els go out of Port: And to the We&s;t, that is, the Wind-ward, as the Ea&s;t is called Lee-ward. This I&s;land has never been troubled with tho&s;e dreadful Hurricanes that &s;o often Ruine and Afflict the <HI>Charibe I&s;lands, Portorico, Hi&s;paniola, Cuba,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="10"> many parts of the Main. Here is no great Ebb or Flood of the Sea, we have not Ob&s;erved above a foot difference, nor can any Pilot give any certain Account of the Currents of the&s;e Seas, they are &s;o various and uncertain, nor can any gue&s;s why the Hurricanes and Earthquakes &s;hould never touch <HI>Jamaica,</HI> &s;ince they &s;o often Afflict all the I&s;lands and Continent.</P>
<P>None of the Rivers of this I&s;land are fair or Navigable, becau&s;e the Countrey is very Mountainous, and the&s;e Hills running through the Centre of it Ea&s;t and We&s;t, the Ri|vers ri&s;e in them, and di&s;embogue North and South; &s;o falling out of the&s;e high Mountains are very Rap|pie, and becau&s;e of the great Rains in them, are &s;ubject to Inundations that carry great &s;tone Rocks and Timber along with the Torrent, &s;o make their u&s;ual Cour&s;e foul and unpa&s;&s;able for Boats, and make and
<PB N="10" REF="11"> change the Bars. There are divers dry Rivers which hinder the Boats from entring into the Countrey, as particularly <HI>Minoa,</HI> that runs through <HI>Clarendon,</HI> which at &s;ome time has not a drop of Water, and at other times as much as the <HI>Thames</HI> at High Water.</P>
<P>The Mountains, whether Stony or Plantable, are generally covered with Excellent Timber for all U&s;es, both for Curio&s;ity, Building, and Dying abundance of Fruit and Spice Trees: The&s;e Mountains are full of Hoggs, and there is probability of Minerals, but no Trees or Fruit that re&s;emble ours in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There's no Towns in this I&s;land but on the South &s;ide, at the Ea&s;t by <HI>Port St. Thomas, Port Morant,</HI> &s;e|veral Hou&s;es called <HI>Rapp-Hou&s;es,</HI> which &s;erve for Store-Hou&s;es and Ale-Hou&s;es for the Neighbourhood, and &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els as u&s;e that Port, which are but few, becau&s;e the
<PB N="11" REF="11"> Governour has not yet permitted Ve&s;&s;els to Di&s;charge there.</P>
<P>At St. <HI>Davids</HI> is <HI>Yhallows Bay,</HI> about &s;even Leagues from <HI>Port St. Thomas,</HI> as far from <HI>Port Royal,</HI> there is &s;everal Ale-Hou&s;es and Store-Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>At <HI>Liguania,</HI> the in-&s;ide of the Harbour, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Port Royal</HI> about two Leagues, is &s;everal Hou&s;es, &s;ome of them very hand&s;om, and well Built, which place in time is like to become a pretty Town.</P>
<P><HI>Port Royal</HI> is Situate on the ex|tream Point of Land that makes the Harbour: It runs about Twelve Miles from the Main off the Land We&s;ternly. It has to the South the Sea, to the North the Harbour, which is the large&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, and mo&s;t convenient in <HI>America.</HI> This Neck of Land is exceeding narrow, and nothing but a loo&s;e Sand that has neither Gra&s;s, Stone, Water, nor Trees. But being &s;o Commodious
<PB N="12" REF="12"> for Ships, that they are Secure all Weathers, and can unload a Float at the Merchants Key: It is the mo&s;t Populous place for Trading in the I&s;land, and there only Ships enters and are di&s;patch'd. In the <HI>Spaniards</HI> time there was no Hou&s;es, the Sea-men of <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s Fleet begun the Town, by Building Store-Hou&s;es, and called it <HI>Cogway,</HI> as we judge corruptly, from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> word <HI>La aguia.</HI> Col. <HI>Doyly</HI> cau&s;ed it to be laid out as a Town, but not very Regularly. In Sir <HI>Char. Littleton</HI>'s time it was called <HI>Port Royal,</HI> from the Excellency of the Harbour.

<P><HI>Jan.</HI> 2. the Adm. arrived with the whole Fleet, and under&s;tood that the Enemy lay with Forces to endea|vour the taking of the Ca&s;tle, where|upon
<PB N="85" REF="48"> he gave order for the Fleet to follow him into the Harbor, but had the ill fortune to be ca&s;t away the Ship that he was in, and four more, but &s;aved the men; the re&s;t being come in fell to preparing to go up the River, where they under&s;tood the Enemy had entrenched them&s;elves, and had &s;ix &s;everal retreating Brea&s;t-works upon the River.</P>

<PB N="86" REF="49"> there was forced to leave our Ships and Boats with 200 men to Guard them under the Gommand of Cap|tain <HI>Robert Delander,</HI> and betook our &s;elves to the wild Woods, where was no path for 24 Miles, but what we cut. The 14th we arrived with|in two Miles of <HI>Venta Cruce,</HI> which was the Landing place, where was a very narrow and dangerous pa&s;|&s;age, where the Enemy thought to put a &s;top to our further proceed|ing, but were pre&s;ently routed by the forlorn, Commanded by Cap|tain <HI>Thomas Regers;</HI> the re&s;t of our men never firing &s;hot, and without any lo&s;s, &s;aving three men &s;lightly wounded; but the Enemies lo&s;s we could never learn. <HI>January</HI> the 15th we arrived at <HI>Venta Cruce,</HI> which is a very fine Village, and the place where they Land and Embarque all the Goods that comes and goes to <HI>Panama,</HI> where we though we might be relieved, having marched three
<PB N="87" REF="49"> daies without Victuals, but found it as the re&s;t, all on Fire, and they fled.</P>
<P>The 16th we began our March, the Enemy con&s;tantly galling us with Ambu&s;cades and &s;mall Parties, and we &s;till beating of them for a League together, although they had all the advantage that could be of us, the way being &s;o narrow that we could but march 4 a brea&s;t, and &s;uch a deep hollow, that the Enemy lay over our heads; about noon that day we got to the <HI>Savanes</HI> &s;afe, with the lo&s;s of three men killed out|right, and &s;ix or &s;even wounded; and of the Enemy 20 killed, and one Captain, be&s;ides many wound|ed, we marched three Miles further, and then took up our Quarters to refre&s;h our men, and thanked them for that daies &s;ervice. The 17th we began our March forward, but had no oppo&s;ition, and about nine of the Clock in the Morning, &s;aw that
<PB N="88" REF="50"> de&s;ired place the South Seas, and likewi&s;e a good parcel of Cattle and hor&s;es, whereupon the G. comanded a general ha&s;t to be made, and our men killed Hor&s;es and Beef enough to &s;erve them all; about four of the Clock in the afternoon, our men having refre&s;hed them&s;elves, we marched again, and about five the &s;ame day we came in &s;ight of the Enemy; where he lay in Batalia with 2100 Foot and 600 Hor&s;e, but finding the day far &s;pent; we thought it not fit to engage, but took up our Quarters within three Miles of them, where we lay very quiet, not being &s;o much as once alarm'd. The next morning being the 18. betimes in the morning, the Gen. gave order to draw our men in Ba|talia, and it was accordingly per|formed, and they were drawn in the form of a <HI>Tertia;</HI> the Vant Guard was led by Lieutenant Col. <HI>Lawrence Prince,</HI> and Major <HI>John Morris,</HI> they
<PB N="89" REF="50"> being in number 300 men, the bo|dy containing 600; the Right wing was led by the Gen. and the left by Col. <HI>Ed. Collier,</HI> the rear-ward of the 300 was Commanded by Col. <HI>Bledry Morgan;</HI> after having viewed our men, and a little encouraged them, the G. commanded the Officers eve|ry man &s;hould repair to his Charge, the Enemy being drawn at &s;uch ad|vantage, they &s;till kept their Stati|on; although often provoked, yet would not &s;tir from their Ground, which we pre&s;ently perceived, and gave order that our men &s;hould wheel their bodies to the left, and endeavour to gain a Hill that was hard by, which, if gained, we &s;hould have forc'd the Enemy to fight to their di&s;advantage, by rea|&s;on he could not bring out of his great body more men to fight at a time, than we could out of our &s;mall body, and likewi&s;e that we &s;hould have the advantage both of Wind
<PB N="90" REF="51"> and Sun. The Officers putting this Command in execution, and the Hill, and a dry Gut accordingly gained, the Enemy was forced to fight upon, their long March having not room to wheel his Battel, by rea&s;on of a Bogg that was drawn behind on purpo&s;e (as he thought) to entrap us, but we taking another ground, in the end proved a &s;nare to him&s;elf, whereupon one <HI>Franci&s;co Detarro,</HI> gave the Charge with his Hor&s;e upon the Vant Guard, and &s;o furiou&s;ly that he came upon the full &s;peed, we having no Pikes, gave or|der that they &s;hould double their Ranks to the Right, and clo&s;e their Files to the Right and Left inward to their clo&s;e order, but his career could not be &s;topt till he lo&s;t his life in the front Rank of our Vant-Guard, upon which the Hor&s;e wheel off to the Right, and their Foot ad|vanced to try their Fortunes, but it proved like their fellows, for we be|ing
<PB N="91" REF="51"> ready with the main Battel to re|ceive them, gave them &s;uch a warm welcom, and pur&s;ued &s;o clo&s;e that every one thought it be&s;t to retreat, but they were &s;o clo&s;ely plyed by our left Wing, who could not come to Engage at fir&s;t, by rea&s;on of the Hill, that the Enemies retreat came to plain running. Although they did work &s;uch a Stratagem that hath been &s;eldom or never heard of, that is when the Foot Engaged in the Flank, he attempted to drive two Droves of Cattel of 1500 apiece in|to the Right and Left Angles of the Reer, but all came to one effect, and helped nothing for their flight to the City, where they had 200 fre&s;h men, and two Forts, one with &s;ix Bra&s;s Guns, the other with eight, and the Streets Barricadoed, and great Guns in every Street, which in all amounted to 32 bra&s;s Guns, but in&s;tead of fighting he command|ed the City to be fired, and his chief
<PB N="92" REF="52"> Forts to be blown up, the which was in &s;uch ha&s;t that he blew up forty of his Souldiers in it, we followed into the Town, where, in the Mar|ket-place they made &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and fired &s;ome great Guns, killed us four men, and wounded five. At three of the Clock in the after|noon we had quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City although on fire, with no more lo&s;s on our &s;ide in this daies work than five men killed, and ten wound|ed. And of the Enemy about 400 where we were all forced to put the fire out of the Enemies Hou&s;es; but it was in vain, for by 12 at night it was all con&s;umed that might be cal|led the City; but of the Subburbs, there was &s;aved 2 Churches, and about 300 Hou&s;es; thus was con|&s;umed that famous and antient City <HI>Panama,</HI> which is the greate&s;t Mart for Silver and Gold in the whole World, for it receives all the Goods into it that comes from old <HI>Spain</HI> in
<PB N="93" REF="52"> the King's great Fleet, and likewi&s;e delivers to the Fleet all the Silver and Gold that comes from the Mines of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Potazi.</HI> Here in this City we &s;tayed 28 daies, making daily Incur&s;ions upon the Enemy by Land for 20 Miles round about, without having &s;o much as one Gun &s;hot at us in anger, although we took in this time near 3000 Pri&s;o|ners of all &s;orts, and kept likewi&s;e Barques in the South Seas, cru&s;ing and fetching of Pri&s;oners that had fled to the I&s;lands with their Goods and Families.</P>
<P><HI>Feb.</HI> 14. we began our March to|wards our Ships, with all our Pri&s;o|ners; and the next day came to <HI>Ven|ta Cruce</HI> about 2 in the afternoon, which is from <HI>Panama</HI> five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Leagues, where we &s;tayed refre&s;hing our &s;elves till the 24th. the 26th we came to <HI>Changra,</HI> where the Plunder was divided among&s;t the Souldiers and Seamen, which amounted to
