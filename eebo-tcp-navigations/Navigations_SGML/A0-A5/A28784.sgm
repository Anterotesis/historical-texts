<P>I Shall acquaint you with the manner of the en|trance of the Queen of <HI>Sweden</HI> into this City. The Archduke of <HI>Tirol</HI> having many months &s;ince been adverti&s;ed of the Queens intention, to pa&s;&s;e through this City, re&s;olved to give her an extraordinary noble entertainment. To this end he &s;ent Letters to all the
<PB N="35" REF="19">Gentry and Nobility in this Country, and to his Friends in the parts adjacent, to wait upon him in their bravery at his Court on Saturday la&s;t. In the evening the Archduke having intelligence that the Queen would lodge within 9 mile of this City, took Po&s;t with his brother the Archbi&s;hop, and a dozen Gentlemen, and onely ki&s;t her hands, bidding her welcom into his Dominions, and returned back hi|ther the &s;ame night. The next day, being Sunday, about 4 in the afternoon, 12 of the Archdukes Trum|petters, and mo&s;t of the afore&s;aid Nobility and Gen|try rode before him, the Archdutche&s;s, which is the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> his Si&s;ter, being carried after him in a rich Sedan, the re&s;t of the Gentry about and behind her; then followed his Guard on Hor&s;back, being 50 Firelocks, his ordirnary Guard with Halberts &s;tan|ding on each &s;ide of the way: and in this equipage he met the Queen about a mile from the City; about 20 yeards before he came at her he light off his hor&s;e, and &s;he out of her Sedan, and &s;aluted one another; and &s;o in the former manner, with Trumpets, Drums, and other loud Mu&s;ick very fine, &s;he entred the City.</P>
<P>The next day I &s;aw her at dinner onely with the Archduke, his Lady, and Brother, which was very magnificent: I made account to have &s;een her at &s;upper, but &s;he &s;upped privately; yet being at the Court, I was told, That the Queen the next day would make open profe&s;&s;ion of the Catholick Faith in the Franci&s;cans or Archdukes Chappell, which not onely I, but all her Prote&s;tant Servants much admired at, and would not believe; but it proved true: For on the Wedne&s;day between a 11 and 12 of clock, &s;he was led to the afore&s;aid Church

Then he gave the Popes Letter to a Prie&s;t that &s;tood by, who red it aloud to the effect above&s;aid; the Letter being read, Mr. <HI>Hol&s;tenius</HI> de&s;ired that in Te&s;timony of the truth, &s;he would make Profe&s;&s;ion of the &s;aid Catholick Apo&s;tolick, and Roman Faith, and &s;wear to keep it upon the Holy Evangeli&s;ts, before the Archduke and the Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;odor, which &s;he did, and ki&s;&s;ed the Book. Then was a Chair for <HI>Hol&s;tenius</HI> to &s;it in, and a Cu&s;hion laid at his Feet, upon which the Queen kneeled, and he making the &s;ign of the Cro&s;&s;e over her head, and embracing her &s;houlders, &s;aid, That he did receive her into the Catholick Church, and by virtue of Order from the Holy Father, Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the VII, and from power given by Chri&s;t, who&s;e Vicar he was, he did ab&s;olve her from all her &s;ins that &s;he had committed, In the Name of the Father, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then were certain &s;hort Prayers &s;aid (or rather &s;ung) in

<P>WE left <HI>Barbadoes</HI> the la&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> and came to St. <HI>Christophers,</HI> where we found a Regiment formed, which we received into our company, not &s;taying to anchor. Thence pa&s;&s;ing forward, we came in &s;ight of <HI>Sancta Luz, Porto Rico,</HI> and &s;ome other I|lands, and on ther 3 of <HI>April</HI> arived before <HI>Sancto Do|mingo,</HI> part of our forces landing within &s;ix miles of the Town, without any oppo&s;ition, but the main of the Army landed near 40 miles beyond it, contrary to what was intended; which fell out in re&s;pect of the ab&s;ence of the Pilot, who being &s;ent out to di&s;|cover, returned not in time. This occa&s;ioned a very long march for the Army through Woods and nar|row Lanes, and all without any guide; which with the heate of the weather, and want of water, put the Army into &s;ome weakne&s;&s;e and di&s;temper, and made them very unfit for &s;ervice. The Souldiers likewi&s;e &s;tragled from their Colours to gather Oranges, Lem|mons, Pines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the extraordinary eating whereof put many of them into the Flux, and Feavers. In this condition we advanced near the Town, where our forelorn, being &s;urpri&s;ed by an Ambu&s;h, and their Leader Adjurant Generall <HI>Jackson</HI> running away, were put to a retreat by 300 men; and there Major Generall <HI>Heans</HI> keeping his ground, was &s;lain. This Ambu&s;cado was afterwards routed by &s;ome of the Sea-men, who came up to relieve the Forlorn. <HI>Iack|&s;on</HI> was ca&s;hiered for cowardize, and had his &s;word broken over his head.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="26">
<P>After this, the Army retreating for &s;ome refre&s;h|ment, it was thought mo&s;t convenient by the Officers, and mo&s;t for the &s;ervice, to leave that Iland (the Ar|my being weakned by their afore&s;aid long march) and to attempt the Iland of <HI>Iamaica:</HI> And having &s;hipped the Army, we arived there uppon the 10 of <HI>May,</HI> and took the Town of <HI>St. Iago de la Vega,</HI> having beat the Enemy from their Forts and Ordnance, who were got together in a body, con&s;i&s;ting of about 3000 men. And from this place nothing did divert our fir&s;t atrempt, but that it had not a name in the world; for we find the Country equall, if not &s;upe|riour to <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and in four miles march here, we &s;aw more Cattle and Plantations then in fourty in <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and a better aire; and the &s;cituation there|of much more advantagious to all purpo&s;es. We are now getting hor&s;es, whereof there are great a|bundance in the I&s;land to make Troopers and Dra|goons, to pur&s;ue the Enemy, who are fled unto the Woods, and endeavour to get away into the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> twenty leagues from this; for prevention whereof we have laid &s;ome Frigots in the way. The Fleet got &s;afe into the Harbor, which is indeed a very &s;afe and gallant one for riding in all winds. We find here Ebony in great plenty, &s;tore of large Cattle, and Timber in abundance for &s;hipping, and &s;ome &s;hips on the &s;tocks in building; the Ground very Fertile, and full of brave Plains and Rivers. There is like|wi&s;e great &s;tore of Salt-Peter, which &s;ome men among us, who are Powder men of <HI>London,</HI> doe affirme, may be had as good and as plentifully, as in any place in the world, and in three years time they will under|take to &s;erve <HI>England</HI> with it, woods and Rivers for carriage being ea&s;ie here, with choice places to erect

<P>We lo&s;t in <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> between two and three hun|dred men by &s;ickne&s;&s;e and Skirmi&s;hes with the ene|my, and killed in the Woods by the Cow-killers, as they were &s;tragling to gather fruit.

<P>IN the la&s;t to you dated the 12 of <HI>March,</HI> by the conveyance of the <HI>Grantham,</HI> we intimated the de|parture of &s;ome Frigats for the Maine, which &s;ince returned with Intelligence onely of 7 &s;hips in the Harbour of <HI>Carthagene.</HI> A few dayes after, A Council of War was called, and it was thought expedient to move upon &s;ome de&s;igne for the advantage of the Commonwealth rather than lie &s;till in Harbour. In order to which, eleven of the be&s;t &s;ailing Frigats in the Fleet were cho&s;en out for the effecting of our purpo&s;e (the Admiral him&s;elf to command in chief.)
<PB N="51" REF="27">The Port we were bound for, proved to be <HI>Rio de la Hache,</HI> a Town about 30 Leagues to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Sancta Martha.</HI> We landed 500 Seamen a mile We&s;t|ward of the Town, where they &s;aluted us from the Fort &s;tanding to the Ea&s;tward with three great &s;hot, but did no execution; whereupon we marched boldly forward, and by the advantage of &s;ome hou&s;es near adjoyning, we got thither, and played our &s;mall &s;hot into the Fort &s;o fa&s;t, that they &s;oon de&s;erted their great Gunns, and begged for Quarter, which was pre&s;ently granted; the Fort was 19 foot high, with a Bre&s;t-work on the top, and 4 bra&s;&s;e Guns mounted: The Inhabitants had &s;ent away all their Goods by their Negroes upon their fir&s;t e&s;piall of us, which was 5 hours before we landed. We &s;tayed there 3 or 4 days, and &s;ent &s;everall Parties up into the Country in que&s;t of the Enemy, but took none &s;ave one Frier, and &s;ome Spani&s;h women and Ne|groes. In the mean time, &s;everall came down with Flags of Truce, and gave us notice, that the Gover|nour of the place would come and compound for them&punc; but they failed at the prefixed time; where|fore Orders were given for carrying aboard the Spa|ni&s;h pri&s;oners (women excepted) and the Town to be immediately fired, and our Forces drawn off.</P>
<P>After all matters were di&s;patched here, we &s;et &s;ail to <HI>Sancta Martha</HI> to review our former &s;poiles. We drew out the &s;ame party, and went on &s;hore, no Ene|my oppo&s;ing, mo&s;t per&s;ons of Quality being fled to <HI>Carthagene</HI> for &s;ecurity. We &s;oon left the place after we had watered; and e&s;pying a Saile at Sea, in few hours we came up with her, and found her to be a Spani&s;h Prize laden with Oyle, Olives, Wine, Stuffs, to a good value.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="28">
<P>Then we moved towards <HI>Carthagene</HI> to &s;hew our &s;elves; we lay there one day, and then 8 of the Fleet departed for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> leaving three of us behind in our former &s;tation, 6 leagues Ea&s;tward of <HI>Carthagene.</HI> In their way they cha&s;ed another Ship laden with Cocoes, and took her, and have &s;ent the Fruit to the Lord Protector: it is good to make Chocolette, which is a great Drink in the&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>We that were behind after the re&s;t of the Fleet, two Evenings together near Sun-&s;et, made another Saile; but night approaching, we lo&s;t &s;ight of her, and the next day &s;aw her at Anchor under <HI>Carthagene</HI> wall. We attempted to bring our Ships near her; but they di&s;covering our intents, haled her a&s;hore, cutting their Cables; &s;o that we being Ships of great burthen, had not depth of Water, be&s;ides the danger of the Forts. We gave the Town a &s;trong Alarm, coming within &s;hot, but they fired no Guns. So we left our cha&s;e, and with the advantage of a We&s;terly wind (which is not u&s;uall here) we got up as high as <HI>Sancta Martha,</HI> and &s;o &s;tood over for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> leaving the other two Ships behind, where they cha&s;ed another Ve&s;&s;ell into the &s;hore, which &s;uffered &s;hipwrack there, laden with Tobacco, Hides, and Cocoes.</P>

<P>THE elde&s;t &s;on of the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Badex</HI> (who was taken pri&s;oner by our Fleet in the Spani&s;h Vice-Admirall, as they came with their Silver from the We&s;t-Indies) being examined, &s;aith upon his Examination: That above five months &s;ince, pre|&s;ently after his Father and Family departed out of <HI>Lima</HI> in <HI>Peru,</HI> there hapned a fearfull Earthquake and mo&s;t miraculous Raine of fire from heaven in <HI>Peru,</HI> in&s;omnch that the whole City of <HI>Lima</HI> is &s;wallowed up and de&s;troyed, and al&s;o the City of <HI>Calao;</HI> in which places there peri&s;hed above twelve thou&s;and Spaniards, and (to &s;ee the great di&s;tingui&s;hing hand of God) not above one hundred Indians with them. In that City al&s;o, <HI>viz. Lima,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath lo&s;t by the Earthquake, one hundred Millions of Silver ready wrought up. Moreover, the famous
<PB N="57" REF="30">Mines and Mountains of <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> (out of which they digged their Silver) are de&s;troyed in a wonderfull manner, &s;o that there is no more of Hills to be &s;een, but all plaine, nor is there any further po&s;&s;ibility of having Gold or Silver in <HI>Peru.</HI> Some of the Spani&s;h them&s;elves doe acknowledge, that this de&s;olation and de&s;truction hath befaln the Spaniards for the Cruelties by them acted upon the poor Indians, they not &s;paring even tho&s;e Indians among them who profe&s;&s;ed the Roman Catholick Religion, in&s;omuch that the mi&s;erable Creatures being beyond mea&s;ure oppre&s;&s;ed, and grieved with their &s;ufferings, cryed to Heaven for vengeance again&s;t them. Never was there a more terible vi&s;ible hand of God in judgment upon any people &s;ince the time of <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomor|rah.</HI> Great is the Lord, marvellous are his doings, and to be had in reverence of all the Nations round about.</P>

<PB N="58" REF="31">another &s;mall man of war, and a Ve&s;&s;ell of Advice from the <HI>Vice Roy</HI> of <HI>Mexico</HI> to <HI>Spain:</HI> They did in fifty eight days proceed &s;o far as within a few leagues of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> without making Land or touching at any place during the voyage, having in their way betwixt the We&s;tern I&s;lands and <HI>Ma&s;&s;agam</HI> in <HI>Affrick,</HI> &s;eized upon a &s;mall <HI>Portugall</HI> as Prize, by whom receiving a fal&s;e information, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had beaten the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet from off their Coa&s;t, a month before; they &s;ayled with much confidence towards <HI>Cadiz</HI> as not expecting oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, were at this time gone to the Bay of <HI>Wyers</HI> in <HI>Portugall</HI> (where they arrived the eleventh of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t) to recruit their wants, and to be in a way of further Orders, the Generalls leaving behind them a Squadron of &s;ix or &s;even Ships (to have an eye upon <HI>Cadiz</HI>) under the command of Captain <HI>Stayner,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Speaker</HI> Frigot: which Squadron on the eight of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, plying to Sea, being forced thither by a &s;trong We&s;terly winde, did at the evening of the day Di&s;cover the &s;aid Spani&s;h Fleet, five or &s;ix Leagues to the We&s;tward of <HI>Cadiz;</HI> And the ap|proach of the night denying opportunity of pre&s;ent action, they endeavoured to fall in with them the next day, which accordingly they did about nine of the clock in the morning (they &s;eeming to the Spa|niards to be Fi&s;her-boats) But there being a fre&s;h Gale that night, all but three of the Squadron were to the Leeward, and could not pre&s;ently come in, and finding it to be the Spani&s;h Fleet come from the Indies, the <HI>Speaker,</HI> the <HI>Bridgwater,</HI> and the <HI>Plymouth</HI> Frigots (not thinking it advi&s;eable to &s;tay for the re&s;t of the &s;quadron, they being within 4 leagues of <HI>Cadiz</HI>)
