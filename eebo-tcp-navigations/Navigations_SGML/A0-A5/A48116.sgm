<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY Old Di&s;temper returning &s;ud|denly upon me, I could not wait on you as I de&s;ign'd, and &s;ee you on Ship-board: Yet my hearty Prayers and Well-wi&s;hes have, and &s;hall ever attend you, for the good Succe&s;s of your Travels, and &s;afe Return. I think my &s;elf al&s;o obliged to congratu|late your happy Voyage, and hopeful Settlement (and as I am informed) in a flouri&s;hing and well-govern'd <HI>Univer&s;i|ty;</HI> where you cannot want Means and Opportunities to improve your Parts con&s;iderably, and enrich your Soul with &s;uch excellent Habits, as none of your Rank and Years may out-do you in the mo&s;t de&s;irable Accompli&s;hments of Know|ledge, Wi&s;dom and Experience.</P>
<P>But (Sir,) be&s;ides tho&s;e many Obli|gations which I &s;hall always recognize with the greate&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of Love and Gratitude, I have &s;everal other Mo|tives
<PB REF="3">and Inducements, (as you'll &s;ee in the Sequel of this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI>) which have prompted me to give you the trouble of peru&s;ing the&s;e following <HI>Sheets:</HI> And tho I am very &s;en&s;ible, that you cannot want the <HI>Coun&s;el</HI> and <HI>Advice</HI> of Men far more eminent for <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Ob|&s;ervation</HI> than I dur&s;t ever pretend to; yet my Endeavours may have their de|&s;ired Influence (and kind Acceptance) as the Effect of undi&s;&s;embled Love and Fi|delity, and the Product of his retired and &s;erious Thoughts, who (to his power) ever was, is, and, God willing, &s;hall be a true Friend to your Self and Family.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t beg leave to tell you, (be|fore I proceed to the &s;ubject Matter of this <HI>Epi&s;tle,</HI>) that the Eyes of your <HI>Country</HI> are much upon you, as the hopeful <HI>Son</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Father;</HI> and there|fore you mu&s;t expect, as your Accompli&s;h|ments, &s;o your Defects will be narrowly and critically ob&s;erved. You mu&s;t there|fore either &s;tudy to equal, and (if po&s;|&s;ible) out-do his eminent <HI>Vertues</HI> and <HI>Endowments,</HI> or otherwi&s;e you'll find that they'll exceedingly le&s;&s;en and e|clip&s;e
<PB REF="3">your own. Be&s;ides, you have left your Country, Relations and Friends, for the increa&s;e of Learning and Experience; we do all therefore hope to &s;ee the generous and worthy Fruits and Effects of your Care and Indu&s;try, and as great a change in your <HI>Per&s;on</HI> as in the <HI>Climate.</HI> Nor can it be much &s;atisfaction to your &s;elf or others, tho you be able to give an account (at your return) of the &s;trange <HI>Occurren|ces</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Event:</HI> For, the Fruits of <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Travel</HI> &s;hould not re&s;t there, but your chief bu&s;ine&s;s will be to culti|vate and beautifie your Soul with &s;uch u&s;eful and profitable Knowledge, as may be a future benefit both to your &s;elf and others; nor can any thing le&s;s than this, counter vail the great Charge, Hazzards, and Fatigues of <HI>Travel.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider (Sir,) that your Co-temporaries here are growing up apace, and may be great <HI>Proficients</HI> in all &s;orts of Learning; and therefore as you'll have greater Opportunities, &s;o you mu&s;t endeavour to make a &s;utable Im|provement in all the gentiel, ingenuous and vertuous Accompli&s;hments, both of
<PB REF="4">Mind and Body. But if by their Dili|gence they &s;hould out-&s;trip you, it would be no little Reflection; not to mention the fruitle&s;s expence of Time and Money, and the far greater Hazzards you run upon among&s;t <HI>Foreigners</HI> and <HI>Fugitives.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will it be un&s;ea&s;onable to remark to you, that &s;everal <HI>Young Gentlemen</HI> (within the compa&s;s of your own ob&s;erva|tion,) have returned from beyond <HI>Sea's,</HI> as ignorant to the full, and more immoral and extravagant, than if they had never left the Smoak of their own Chimneys. They have indeed dearly purcha&s;ed, and brought over with them &s;ome new <HI>Modes,</HI> affected <HI>Ge&s;tures,</HI> (if not the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Country,) and &s;uch Language and Deportment as are not only ungentiel and unbecoming, but unmanly and unchri|&s;tian: (We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to take notice of &s;ome <HI>Particulars</HI> afterwards;) in&s;omuch that they are &s;o far from being either wi&s;er, or better for their <HI>Travels,</HI> that (to give them their due) they have only commenced <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> of that <HI>helli&s;h</HI> and <HI>black Art</HI> of <HI>Debauchery, Irreligion</HI> and <HI>Profanene&s;s.</HI> But,</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>The&s;e Examples (Sir,) are only noted by way of <HI>caution:</HI> For we know, and &s;hall always hope for, and expect better Things and Fruits from you: And your virtuous <HI>Temper,</HI> and hither to religious <HI>Education,</HI> will be a Sovereign <HI>Antidote,</HI> and &s;ure <HI>Defen&s;itive</HI> again&s;t all the dan|gerous and charming <HI>Illectives</HI> you can po&s;&s;ibly meet with. To which give me leave to add the following <HI>Advice,</HI> which I hope may be u&s;eful to you in all your <HI>Tra|vels;</HI> nor &s;hall it be un&s;ea&s;onable, whil&s;t you continue in that well govern'd <HI>Socie|ty,</HI> where perhaps the lea&s;t Danger is neither fear'd nor &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>Not to trouble you with a longer <HI>Ex|ordium:</HI> What I have further to impart, &s;hall for Methods &s;ake, be comprehended under the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> following <HI>Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI> And the</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, will re&s;pect the well-husbanding and management of your <HI>Time</HI> in attend|ing your <HI>Studies,</HI> or <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> with others. The</P>
<P>Second, <HI>Your Morals,</HI> and <HI>Civil De|portment.</HI> And the</P>
<P>Third, <HI>Your Religion.</HI></P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>In all which I &s;hall endeavour to lay down &s;uch <HI>Rules,</HI> as I hope may direct and encourage you to imploy your <HI>Time</HI> to the be&s;t Purpo&s;es; &s;o that you may go on chearfully in your <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, delight and &s;atisfaction; and return home thro' Gods Ble&s;&s;ing, every way accompli&s;ht, as a well-bred <HI>Gentle|man,</HI> a good <HI>Scholar,</HI> and a &s;ound <HI>Chri|&s;tian.</HI> All which would be the greate&s;t Comfort and Ble&s;&s;ing to your <HI>Parents,</HI> an Ornament to your <HI>Country,</HI> and the mo&s;t peculiar Happine&s;s to your <HI>Self.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A LETTER OF ADVICE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN Now in His TRAVELS Beyond the SEA'S, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> PART I. <HI>Of ST&V;DIES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOW (Sir) it would be an ill and unaccountable Application of your <HI>Time,</HI> if your <HI>Quality</HI> (as we
<PB N="2" REF="6">have &s;een in too many) &s;hould make you impatient of Di&s;cipline and Re|&s;traint, or make you con&s;ult your Li|berty and Ea&s;e; the Effects whereof are u&s;ually dangerous and de&s;tructive. For &s;ince God has ble&s;&s;ed and ennobled you with the Priviledges of Birth and Blood, and an ingenuous and religi|ous Education, you &s;hould imploy your Time and Faculties in the &s;earch of, and pur&s;uit after tho&s;e things which now, and in the after-cour&s;e of your Life, will afford you the greate&s;t Ad|vantages, as well as Plea&s;ure and De|light. You mu&s;t not fancy then, that God made you only for Sports and Pa&s;times, but gentiel and heroic Exer|ci&s;es: Let tho&s;e who under&s;tand no better, plea&s;e and divert them&s;elves with their Hor&s;es, Dogs, Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But what are all the&s;e to the more noble and worthy Endowments of a Gentle|man and a Scholar? And &s;eeing God has been plea&s;ed to ble&s;s you with the under&s;tanding and all other Faculties of a Man (and tho&s;e too in the be&s;t degree) imploy the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of
<PB N="3" REF="6">your Time (e&s;pecially now whil&s;t you have Lei&s;ure, Opportunity, and few Avocations) at your <HI>Book,</HI> and in your <HI>Study.</HI> For,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, As this will adorn your Soul with the greate&s;t Trea&s;ures this World can afford, &s;o you'l have cau&s;e to con|gratulate to your &s;elf your own Hap|pine&s;s, and God Almighty will ble&s;s and pro&s;per you in your Endeavours: Who even in <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> would not al|low Plea&s;ure to the fir&s;t <HI>Adam</HI> (tho certainly as Noble as any of his De|&s;cendents) without Labour and Indu&s;try. Nor can your retired and &s;eeming Ob|&s;curity in your <HI>Studies</HI> le&s;&s;en your Gentility, &s;ince there's no well-bred <HI>Scholar</HI> that can fail of the Reputa|tion and Character of a Gentleman. But be&s;ides,</P>
<P>Secondly, You'l hereby become not only more courteous and obliging to all you conver&s;e with, but more ca|pable al&s;o of managing (with Prudence and Di&s;cretion) tho&s;e weighty Affairs which may await you at your Return; and your Birth and Education will in|title
<PB N="4" REF="7">you to, both of Ju&s;tice and State. Be&s;ides, you'l better under&s;tand what Re&s;pect and Encouragement is defer|vedly due to Learned Men, (&s;uch I mean as are diligent, &s;ober and pious) and herein your dear and worthy <HI>Fa|ther</HI> may be a Pattern to you, who by his di&s;creet and obliging Carriage, has extreamly endear'd him&s;elf to all Scholars, but the Orthodox Clergy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> e&s;pecially. And hence 'tis very ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e Gentlemen only who have purcha&s;ed to them&s;elves the honour of Learning and true Breeding, know be&s;t how to value and e&s;teem, and are mo&s;t willing to encourage tho&s;e Attainments in others; which will al&s;o have a mighty Influence upon all your Dependents, as well as others below you, who do u&s;ually ei|ther re&s;pect or contemn wi&s;e and good Men, by the Examples of their <HI>Lea|ders.</HI> Con&s;ider,</P>
<P>Thirdly, That whereas the Vertues or Vices of private Men do common|ly pa&s;s without much Notice or Cen|&s;ure, you'l be&s;et as it were a <HI>Beacon</HI> up|on
<PB N="5" REF="7">an Hill; and as the Words of great Men are u&s;ually <HI>Maxims</HI> and <HI>Theorems,</HI> &s;o their Actions become Examples, Rules and Pre&s;idents for others to &s;teer and walk by. Be&s;ides, you'l be no le&s;s e&s;teemed and admired for the Excellen|cy of your natural and acquired Abili|ties, than herein for the &s;way and in|fluence of your Authority; nor can any thing be more ba&s;e and inglorious, than a Gentleman only by name, who&s;e Soul is ignorant and Life immoral.</P>
<P>Fourthly, There's nothing in this World, which can countervail the great Expence of your Time and Pains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but <HI>Learning</HI> and <HI>Experience</HI> (as before) which are only attainable by <HI>Study</HI> and a &s;utable <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> with Scholars and Men of Parts; for hereby you may be qualified both for Action and Speculation, and excel the <HI>Mobile</HI> as much in Under&s;tanding and Vertue, as Nobility of Birth and gentiel Extraction. Now, the&s;e are the genuine and proper Fruits of <HI>Education and Study;</HI> and un|le&s;s you imploy and improve your Time and Faculties to the&s;e purpo&s;es, tho per|haps
<PB N="6" REF="8">you may gratifie and plea&s;e your Fancy with vain and empty Delights, yet your Under&s;tanding will prove un|fruitful; and after many tedious and dangerous <HI>Traver&s;es,</HI> you may return Home with a &s;hatter'd Body, and a bar|ren and empty Soul.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all &s;uch generous <HI>Induce|ments,</HI> as will prevail with your ingenu|ous Temper and Inclination, to keep clo&s;e to your <HI>Studies:</HI> But as a further Obligation and Inforcement, give me leave to remind you of the <HI>Mi&s;carriages</HI> of &s;ome (who would neither be per&s;ua|ded to love Learning nor Books) which may be a &s;ure <HI>Caution</HI> to you to avoid tho&s;e Sins and Indi&s;cretions of licenti|ous and ungovern'd Youth.</P>
<P>For ala&s;s! we have many deplorable In&s;tances (the Sparks and Blades of our Age) who con&s;ume their Time, Parts, Wit, E&s;tates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in pur&s;uit of the greate&s;t Fooleries and Vanities in the World, to the greate&s;t &s;hame and di&s;grace of them|&s;elves, and &s;candal of others; as if they were a di&s;tinct <HI>Species</HI> from all Rational Beings, and made only for a Sword, or
<PB N="7" REF="8">a Hor&s;e, or a Dog, and the other bruti&s;h and &s;en&s;ual Exerci&s;es of Luxury and Profanene&s;s. I am no Enemy to mode|rate and innocent Plea&s;ures; but tho&s;e <HI>Sots</HI> and <HI>Ignaro's</HI> make it their Trade and way of Living, to ob&s;erve all Modes and Fa&s;hions, drink, &s;wear, cur&s;e, whore, game, &s;ight and quarrel like Hectors and Madmen, de&s;pi&s;e and &s;corn all be|low them, and run on in a full Carreer of Sin and Extravagance.</P>
<P>In&s;omuch, that I'm afraid they have &s;carce lei&s;ure to &s;ay their Prayers, or look on a Book, and therefore wholly unfit for Chri&s;tian or ingenuous Con|ver&s;e; (their Dogs, Hor&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being u&s;ually the Subjects of their <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> in their more &s;erious Intervals). By all which inhuman Methods, many of them are become &s;o barbarou&s;ly Ignorant, and void of all Learning, that they have al|mo&s;t forgot that ever they were at <HI>Schools</HI> or <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> (unle&s;s they hap|pen to remember &s;ome <HI>Pranks</HI> they play'd there) and are as much &s;trangers to <HI>Humanity, Philo&s;ophy, Hi&s;tory, &amp;c.</HI> as if there had been never any &s;uch thing
<PB N="8" REF="9">as Books or Learning in the World.</P>
<P>Nor are the&s;e the Faults only of our home-bred Gentlemen; (for we have many learned, wi&s;e, and good Men, who never had the Curio&s;ity nor Convenience of Travel) but even of tho&s;e who have &s;een many Foreign Countries, Cities, Delights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet neglecting the Bu&s;i|ne&s;s they went about (as we have ob&s;er|ved already) have returned home after many impertinent Wandrings, more vain and prodigal, wicked and irreligi|ous, than tho&s;e Companions of Igno|rance and Epicuri&s;m they left behind them. For what plea&s;ure and &s;atisfacti|on has that Man, who has &s;een all the Novelties and Curio&s;ities in the World, if he has &s;tudied nothing el&s;e but to plea&s;e and pamper his own Appetite? All that we can &s;ay of him, is, that he has be&s;towed much pains to no purpo&s;e, or for that which is wor&s;e; and bought his Sins and Vanities at a dearer rate than others.</P>
<P>Thus, I have &s;et before you tho&s;e <HI>Ar|guments</HI> and <HI>Motives,</HI> and <HI>Dangers</HI> and <HI>Hazards,</HI> on the right hand and on the
<PB N="9" REF="9">left, which your <HI>Prudence</HI> will con&s;ider betimes; &s;o, that you may improve all tho&s;e Opportunities that fall in your way to the be&s;t advantages, le&s;t you &s;hould unhappily <HI>mi&s;carry</HI> in your great <HI>Adventure,</HI> (as tho&s;e mi&s;erable In&s;tan|ces we have already noted; which the Lord of his great mercy avert.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider again, that your Station, Quality and Parts, may di&s;po&s;e you at your Return for Offices of Honour and Tru&s;t; wherein you may be highly Serviceable to your King and Country, as your <HI>worthy Father</HI> is, and has been before you: Nor can any <HI>Magi&s;trate</HI> be duly qualified to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice or Coun&s;el, with ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf, or for the benefit of others, but by &s;uch habitual Accompli&s;hments as are the proper Re&s;ults of <HI>Study</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervation:</HI> In&s;omuch that <HI>Charles the Great,</HI> Emperour, did &s;olemnly de|clare, <HI>That he had rather abound in Knowledge than Riches and Honour.</HI></P>
<P>But be&s;ides tho&s;e foregoing <HI>Topicks,</HI> you'l find by <HI>Experience,</HI> that the Plea|&s;ures as well as the Benefits of <HI>Study,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="10">are &s;o charming and delightful, that 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible for a <HI>Scholar</HI> to be idle: E&s;pecially con&s;idering (as a Learn|ed Man ob&s;erves) the many Improve|ments of Rea&s;on, the &s;weetne&s;s and de|lights of Knowledge, the great range and multitude of Thoughts and Specu|lations; for there's much wit in Poe|try, in Philo&s;ophy Rea&s;on, improved, in Mathematicks Acutene&s;s, in Hi&s;tory curious and &s;trange Events, in Politicks variety of Projects and De&s;igns, in Ora|tory &s;weet and delightful Eloquence, in Divinity &s;upernatural Light, Rules of holy Living and Dying, and heavenly Devotions: Which la&s;t will be a means to &s;anctifie all Endeavours to your u&s;e, and make all your other <HI>Studies</HI> both plea&s;ant and profitable.</P>
<P>Now a &s;trict and diligent Enquiry in|to all the&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of Learning, will fill up all the empty Spaces of your <HI>Time,</HI> which is commonly mi&s;-imploy|ed, if not vainly mi&s;-&s;pent, by all tho&s;e Gentlemen that are not Scholars. You may alter the <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> of your <HI>Studies</HI> as you plea&s;e, &s;o that there
<PB N="11" REF="10">&s;hall never be any &s;pare Time upon your hands; nor will it ever &s;eem to pa&s;s away &s;lowly. But &s;eeing the <HI>Hus|banding of Time well,</HI> is a thing of the greate&s;t advantage and importance to a <HI>Student;</HI> I &s;hall give you an account of the <HI>Method</HI> which I have u&s;ed, and found very &s;ucce&s;sful in the Conduct of mine own <HI>Studies:</HI> Yet I would not have you to ob&s;erve it &s;o exactly, as to neglect the more &s;ea&s;onable <HI>Ad|vice</HI> of others.</P>
<P>Now I have always thought, that 'tis the Duty and Intere&s;t of every Chri&s;ti|an to be well skill'd in the divine Arith|metick of numbring his Days: For Time is a precious Jewel, for which we mu&s;t all be accountable; and there|fore he who lo&s;es a Day is dangerou&s;ly prodigal; but tho&s;e that dare mi&s;-&s;pend it, little le&s;s than de&s;perate. For the prevention then of tho&s;e Evils and Mi&s;|chiefs re&s;ulting from the fruitle&s;s ex|pence of <HI>Time,</HI> I &s;hall propound to you this following <HI>Method.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Ri&s;e early in the Morning, if your Health permit; for <HI>Aurora mu&s;is
<PB N="12" REF="11">amica,</HI> and the &s;ooner the more early the Ble&s;&s;ing. Let your <HI>fir&s;t Thoughts</HI> be always with <HI>God;</HI> return him mo&s;t humble and hearty <HI>Thanks</HI> for your Re|fre&s;hment and Protection from the dan|gers of the Night. Pre&s;ent the <HI>fir&s;t Fruits</HI> of your Rea&s;on and other Facul|ties to your <HI>Maker;</HI> think on him whil&s;t you are dre&s;&s;ing, and humbly beg that you may be clothed upon with the Robes of your Saviours Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the mo&s;t precious Ornaments of his Grace and Spirit.</P>
<P>Then return to your <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> and pray earne&s;tly, &s;ervently, con&s;tantly, devoutly and affectionately unto God, for your Pre&s;ervation that day, and for ever, from Temptation. Sin and Danger; and that he would &s;anctifie your Per&s;on, and ble&s;s and pro&s;per you in your <HI>Stu|dies.</HI> 'Twas <HI>Luthers</HI> ob&s;ervation of him&s;elf, that <HI>bene or a&s;&s;e e&s;t bene &s;tudui&s;&s;e;</HI> and if your Heart be early &s;ea&s;on'd with Gods Pre&s;ence, 'twill reli&s;h of him all the day after. And when you have thus happily performed your <HI>Morning Devotions,</HI> then,</P>
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<P>Secondly, Sit down a little and con|&s;ider (e&s;pecially if you have occa&s;ion to go abroad or entertain Company that day at your Chamber,) what Tempta|tions or Sins you are in danger to run upon; re&s;olve again&s;t them, and &s;ee that your Purpo&s;es be fixt and &s;teady: So that if any of tho&s;e Temptations &s;hould afterwards a&s;&s;ault you, call to mind what you have re&s;olved on in your <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> and then endeavour to arm your &s;elf again&s;t them with the Argu|ments of your Religion; as the con&s;i|derations of <HI>Death, Judgment, Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell.</HI> But if you expect nothing <HI>extraordinary</HI> that day, (intending to continue in the cour&s;e of your <HI>Studies,</HI>) then a &s;erious Recommendation of your Per&s;on and A&s;&s;airs to God, in a general <HI>Petition,</HI> will be acceptable and &s;uffi|cient.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Begin your <HI>Studies</HI> with reading a <HI>Chapter</HI> or more of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> every <HI>morning,</HI> till you have read it all over; and then begin again; always ob&s;erving the &s;ame <HI>Method.</HI> Meditate of, and con&s;ider well what
<PB N="14" REF="12">you read, that you may thence collect &s;ome u&s;eful <HI>Notes</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> for the Confirmation of your Faith, and Conduct of your Manners in the ways of Religion. And having read &s;ome Por|tion of the Holy Scripture &s;eriou&s;ly and deliberately, (for the better under|&s;tanding of it, you may con&s;ult Dr. <HI>Hammonds</HI> Paraphra&s;e, or <HI>Grotius;</HI>) this, with your Prayers, will prepare you for your other <HI>Studies.</HI> Wherein,</P>
<P>Fourthly, Your <HI>Tutor</HI> will be care|ful to give you the mo&s;t proper and &s;ea|&s;onable <HI>Advice.</HI> Your <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> Lear|ning will be chiefly (as I &s;uppo&s;e) <HI>Lo|gicks</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy:</HI> Now if you'l but take pains to be an accurate <HI>Logician,</HI> and thorow-paced <HI>Philo&s;opher,</HI> (which will not require very much time, if you be always careful to attend the Lectures and Di&s;putations in the <HI>Schools</HI>) you'l readily under&s;tand any Author; and the whole cour&s;e of all your future <HI>Studies,</HI> will not only thereby become beneficial, but plea&s;ant and delightful.</P>
<P>Yet herein I de&s;ire to <HI>caution</HI> you, not to &s;pend too much <HI>Time</HI> in dry and
<PB N="15" REF="12">u&s;ele&s;s <HI>Notions</HI> and <HI>Speculations,</HI> being a Fault which I have ob&s;erved in the Methods of reading <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI> in Fo|reign <HI>&V;niver&s;ities;</HI> for no <HI>Study</HI> is worth a Mans while that's not accom|panied with Profit, and &s;uch unan&s;we|rable Rea&s;ons and Arguments as are in a great mea&s;ure able to &s;ilence all fu|ture Debates, &s;eeing the capacity of the Ignorant lyes as much below &s;uch <HI>Phi|lo&s;ophical Curio&s;ities,</HI> as the more know|ing and judicious are above them; &s;o that there remains to all in things du|bious and only probable, a Power to admit, or reject what Opinions they plea&s;e. Therefore I would recommend <HI>Mathematicks</HI> next to <HI>Logicks,</HI> as the mo&s;t u&s;eful part of <HI>Philo&s;ophy;</HI> for this <HI>Science</HI> propo&s;es nothing but what's apparent by mo&s;t undeniable <HI>Demon|&s;trations;</HI> which Knowledge is not on|ly the chief we can acquire upon Earth, but will al&s;o accompany us to Heaven.</P>
<P>Fifthly, When you have lei&s;ure, read over your <HI>Cla&s;&s;ick Authors,</HI> and remark with your Pen what you find mo&s;t ob|&s;ervable in them; for as you'l hereby
<PB N="16" REF="13">under&s;tand the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of the mo&s;t antient and celebrated <HI>Hea|thens;</HI> &s;o this &s;ort of Learning will qua|lifie you to write and &s;peak Latin well: And when you have obtained this <HI>Fa|culty,</HI> you cannot be a &s;tranger in any place where you come; nor can any thing be a greater Ornament to a Gen|tleman and a Scholar.</P>
<P>Sixthly, And &s;eeing your Quality and E&s;tate will exempt you from all other Profe&s;&s;ions but that of a <HI>States-man,</HI> the Knowledge of all &s;orts of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> will be very u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary; but e&s;pecially <HI>French Authors,</HI> being of all others the mo&s;t accurate in <HI>Negotia|tions</HI> and <HI>Memoirs,</HI> recorded by pub|lick <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> and publi&s;ht by their <HI>Se|cretaries</HI> after their Deaths: For 'tis ob&s;erv'd by a Per&s;on of great Judgment and Policy, that none make more faith|ful <HI>Reports</HI> of things done in all Nations than <HI>Amba&s;&s;adours;</HI> having the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentick Intelligence from their <HI>Princes Pen&s;ioners,</HI> who are obliged to acquaint them with all they can di&s;|cover.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="13">
<P>Seventhly, Con&s;ult likewi&s;e all the &s;everal <HI>Speeches, Declarations, Tryals</HI> and <HI>Tran&s;actions,</HI> occa&s;ion'd by the late unhappy <HI>Wars</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> wherein you'l find more natural and u&s;eful Know|ledge, than is ordinarily to be met with in all the mouldy <HI>Records</HI> of antient <HI>Stati&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Polititians.</HI></P>
<P>Eighthly, There will be no need to advi&s;e you what <HI>Authors</HI> you &s;hall read in <HI>Divinity;</HI> for I know &s;ufficient care is taken for that already; yet in my <HI>O|pinion,</HI> next to the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> and our <HI>Churches Catechi&s;m,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammonds Practical Catechi&s;m,</HI> and tho&s;e Books by the <HI>Author</HI> of the <HI>Whole Duty of Man,</HI> are the be&s;t. And indeed all our mo|dern <HI>Writers</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> for the la&s;t fifty or &s;ixty years, (who have imploy'd their Parts, Faculties and Time, in treating <HI>de omni ente,</HI> and out|done the greate&s;t part of the World,) if accurately read and well dige&s;ted, will furni&s;h you with variety of <HI>Matter,</HI> all &s;orts of <HI>Methods,</HI> and a delicate <HI>Style.</HI> But then you &s;hould take <HI>Advice</HI> in the choice of &s;uch <HI>Books,</HI> as are <HI>approved</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="14">and mo&s;t <HI>authentick</HI> upon every <HI>Sub|ject,</HI> that the whole Time of your <HI>Stu|dy</HI> may be profitably imployed; for a <HI>few Books</HI> well read and throughly di|ge&s;ted, will more improve your Rea&s;on and Judgment, than hundreds &s;uperfici|ally turned over, as many <HI>young Stu|dents</HI> do.</P>
<P>Yet there's abundance of Plea&s;ure in variety of Books; for when your Facul|ties grow dull and weary of one, you may pa&s;s to another, as your own <HI>Ge|nius</HI> and <HI>Inclination</HI> &s;hall direct; where|by the whole Time and Bu&s;ine&s;s of your <HI>Study</HI> will become a delight and bene|fit, rather than a burthen to you: Nor can any <HI>Recreation</HI> be &s;o plea&s;ant, (this I find by experience,) nor any <HI>Labour</HI> &s;o profitable to a <HI>Scholar</HI> as <HI>Study.</HI> And,</P>
<P>La&s;tly, You'l find it of &s;ingular u&s;e and advantage for the improvement of your <HI>Parts,</HI> to imploy and exerci&s;e your <HI>Pen</HI> upon every <HI>Occa&s;ion. Write</HI> often to your <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Friends;</HI> for the neglect of that is a general fault in <HI>young Students.</HI> Have always a <HI>Common-Place Book</HI> by you, (your <HI>Tutor</HI> will direct
<PB N="19" REF="14">you to the mo&s;t u&s;eful <HI>Heads,</HI> and note therein the mo&s;t remarkable, quaint, and ingenuous Pa&s;&s;ages you meet with in any <HI>Author,</HI> which you may afterwards have recour&s;e to immediate|ly upon every occa&s;ion: Ob&s;erve like|wi&s;e, and note in writing, all the Re|markable <HI>Occurrences</HI> in your Travel; particularly the <HI>Situation</HI> of <HI>Places,</HI> the <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> of the <HI>People,</HI> their <HI>Religion, Government, Policies, Traf|fique,</HI> &amp;c. This will be of great ea&s;e to your <HI>Memory,</HI> and of &s;ingular u&s;e and advantage in the whole Progre&s;s of your Life; be&s;ides, you'l find that your <HI>Parts, Style</HI> and <HI>Method,</HI> will be the be&s;t im|proved by much <HI>Writing:</HI> All Learn|ed Men can witne&s;s this from their own Experience, and is very remarkable in all our <HI>Engli&s;h Worthies;</HI> in&s;omuch that I dare be confident, if you'l apply your &s;elf to this method, your Rea&s;on and Judgment will by degrees attain to &s;uch a Habit, as will not dare to pre&s;ent you with any thing but what's very curious and excellent.</P>
<P>Yet I would not hereby engage you
<PB N="20" REF="15">to be &s;o earne&s;t in the pur&s;uit of your <HI>Studies,</HI> as to prejudice your own <HI>Con|&s;titution;</HI> for there's a Time for all things, and too much reading may prevent the Acce&s;s of a newer, nearer, and quicker Invention of your own: Be&s;ides, if your Body be &s;trong, as you'l rather complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of the Day, than be wea|ried with <HI>Study;</HI> &s;o, if it be weak and feeble, the <HI>Decays</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> may be re|paired, being al&s;o allowed to the &s;trong|e&s;t <HI>Con&s;titutions,</HI>) either, Fir&s;t, By a &s;utable <HI>Conver&s;ation;</HI> or, Secondly, By moderate and innocent <HI>Recreations.</HI></P>
<P>For the fir&s;t of the&s;e, namely a &s;utable <HI>Conver&s;ation:</HI> When you are wearied and indi&s;po&s;ed with your <HI>Studies,</HI> a door of <HI>Conference</HI> is open, and the <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> of learned, wi&s;e, and good Men, is a greater Refiner of the <HI>Spirit</HI> than <HI>Books.</HI> Yet let not this tempt you from your <HI>Studies</HI> in the Forenoon, which is the mo&s;t proper Time to be re&s;erved, and at your Book; however, whil&s;t you conti|nue in the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity:</HI> And herein let me advi&s;e you to lay down &s;uch <HI>Rules</HI> to your &s;elf, in ob&s;erving tho&s;e &s;tated
<PB N="21" REF="15"><HI>Hours,</HI> as no Man &s;hall be able to per|&s;uade you to recede from them; for that when your <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> are once known, as no Per&s;on of Ingenuity will di&s;turb you, &s;o you'l find this <HI>Method</HI> of keep|ing this be&s;t part of the <HI>Day</HI> to your &s;elf,) will become not only practicable, but very commendable, and of &s;ingular benefit to you in more in&s;tances than I can readily mention.</P>
<P>But when <HI>Dinner</HI> is over, (&s;o &s;oon as you can with <HI>convenience</HI> and <HI>civility</HI> to the Company,) retire to your <HI>Clo&s;et,</HI> and pray (as in the <HI>Morning,</HI>) always concluding your <HI>Devotions</HI> in the Name of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and with the <HI>Lords Prayer:</HI> Again, <HI>read</HI> &s;ome por|tion of the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> in the <HI>Old Te|&s;tament,</HI> and the <HI>P&s;alms</HI> for the <HI>Day,</HI> and (as before) with attentive <HI>Ob&s;ervation.</HI> (And be as careful in performing your <HI>Evening Devotions,</HI> with <HI>Thank&s;givings</HI> for the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> and earne&s;t Prayer for your <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Protection,</HI> that night and for ever). I do not doubt but you have good

<P>But to return, having performed your <HI>Devotions</HI> after <HI>Dinner,</HI> then you may either go to, or &s;end for &s;uch <HI>Companions</HI> as you think fit, and &s;ee that they be al|ways <HI>choice</HI> and <HI>few;</HI> for as the vitious and unlearned are not worthy of your <HI>Company</HI> and <HI>Acquaintance,</HI> &s;o too many of the more learned, wi&s;er, and better &s;ort, will but increa&s;e the <HI>expence</HI> both of your <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Money;</HI> be&s;ides, the <HI>Examples</HI> of others do u&s;ually prevail more, and have a greater Influence than their <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;els;</HI> and by the opportunities of <HI>Conver&s;e,</HI> either good or bad, we commonly imbibe all the Tinctures of <HI>Vice</HI> or <HI>Vertue;</HI> in&s;omuch that 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t prudent Man to hold out long again&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="16">the forcible Batteries of Cu&s;tom and Opportunity. But,</P>
<P>There are no certain <HI>Rules</HI> to be pre|&s;cribed for <HI>Conver&s;e;</HI> &s;eeing all Di&s;cour|&s;es of that <HI>Kind</HI> are <HI>Occa&s;ional,</HI> and de|pend much upon the <HI>Circum&s;tances</HI> of <HI>Time, Place, Per&s;ons,</HI> &amp;c. yet a Gentle|man has u&s;ually the freedom to be as inqui&s;itive as he plea&s;es; and what would be cen&s;ured in others as humorous <HI>Mo|ro&s;ene&s;s,</HI> or pragmatical <HI>Sawcine&s;s,</HI> will be interpreted in you, as an ingenuous de&s;ire and thir&s;t after Knowledge: Therefore 'tis a &s;ingular and extraor|dinary Priviledge you have in this Kind above Per&s;ons of a lower Rank, which (being improved to the be&s;t Advanta|ges,) may very much conduce to your Intere&s;t and Satisfaction; for he's a ve|ry weak Companion from whom you may not receive &s;ome benefit, and re|turn <HI>wi&s;er.</HI> But then if you <HI>corre&s;pond</HI> with Learned Men and Communicative, they'l freely impart to you tho&s;e <HI>Secrets</HI> (in a little time,) which have co&s;t them, and would have put you to the expence of much Pains and Travel; and if the

<P>Yet give me leave to <HI>caution</HI> you in two things: And Fir&s;t, See that you be innocently free and chearful in your <HI>Conver&s;ation:</HI> Let <HI>hoc age</HI> be your con|&s;tant <HI>Motto;</HI> for if a Man be &s;ullen, mo|ro&s;e, mopi&s;h, and un&s;ea&s;onably poring upon his Book or Bu&s;ine&s;s, he lo&s;es the Fruits and Benefits of <HI>Conver&s;e,</HI> nor will his <HI>Company</HI> be looked upon by others to be either <HI>profitable</HI> or <HI>diver&s;ive.</HI> And Secondly, Avoid the other Extreme of <HI>talking too much,</HI> as trouble&s;ome and ab|&s;urd; for every Man that can be a fit Companion for you, will expect to have a &s;hare in the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e.</HI> It mu&s;t needs then be a great Vanity in many Gentle|men, who having &s;ome little &s;matte|rings of Learning, (for empty Ve&s;&s;els have the loude&s;t Sound,) do make all Places eccho with their <HI>Latin, Italian,
<PB N="25" REF="17">French,</HI> &amp;c. and Citations out of the mo&s;t celebrated Authors; for the more that any Man &s;eems to borrow from Books, he do's thereby proclaim the meanne&s;s of his own natural Parts, which only and properly can be call'd his own.</P>
<P>Be re&s;erved in pa&s;&s;ing your Judg|ment, e&s;pecially in what may concern the Reputations or Intere&s;ts of other Men; your Bu&s;ine&s;s will be rather to enquire (as before,) and that too with all po&s;&s;ible Candor and Mode&s;ty, into the Policies and Forms of Government, all &s;orts of Learning, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore to this End endeavour to be acquainted, and <HI>conver&s;e</HI> with Men of the greate&s;t Parts Sobriety and Experience; from whom you'l always receive Benefit, and note &s;omething worthy your Ob&s;erva|tion. I would not advi&s;e you to avoid wholly the Conver&s;ation of your <HI>Coun|try-men,</HI> yet corre&s;pond as little with them as po&s;&s;ible; for you would find it very unprofitable upon &s;everal ac|counts, which I leave to your own Con&s;ideration.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="18">
<P>Thus every thing is beautiful in its Sea&s;on: And we have &s;een hitherto how the chief part of your Time &s;hould be imployed at your <HI>Book, Lectures,</HI> and <HI>Exerci&s;es</HI> in the <HI>Schools,</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;a|tion</HI> with others, whil&s;t you continue in the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity,</HI> or when &s;etled in any other Place: (For upon <HI>Travel,</HI>) the Methods mu&s;t be altered and order'd ac|cording to the Laws and Dictates of Prudence and Di&s;cretion. And tho neither <HI>Birth,</HI> nor <HI>Quality,</HI> nor <HI>E&s;tate,</HI> can give any Man a Priviledge or Pa|tent to be idle: Yet,</P>
<P>Secondly, There mu&s;t be &s;ome con|venient Time &s;et apart (which &s;hould always be in the <HI>Afternoon,</HI>) for &s;ea&s;o|nable and innocent <HI>Refre&s;hments;</HI> the Diver&s;ion and Reparation of your wea|ry <HI>Thoughts,</HI> as well as the Ea&s;e and Sup|port of your <HI>Body.</HI> But herein I mu&s;t <HI>caution</HI> you, that your <HI>Recreations</HI> be <HI>moderate,</HI> endeavouring always to con|fine your &s;elf to the&s;e following <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ures.</HI></P>

<P>THE tender Care of your Worthy <HI>Parents</HI> in your vertuous and re|ligious, as well as learned Education, and

<P>Fir&s;t, It will be a great Argument of Parts and Di&s;cretion, to be mode&s;t and re&s;erved in <HI>&s;peaking of your Self, Family,</HI> and <HI>Affairs,</HI> le&s;t by a &s;anciful and over|weaning Conceit of your own <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Merits,</HI> you de&s;ervedly incur the the Cen&s;ure of <HI>Pragmaticalne&s;s</HI> and <HI>O&s;tentation;</HI> from which <HI>Precipice</HI> many have dangerou&s;ly fallen: For we know that <HI>Pride</HI> was the Sin of the <HI>fallen An|gels</HI> and Foundre&s;s of Hell, the ruine
<PB N="31" REF="20">of Mankind from the beginning of the <HI>Creation,</HI> and ever &s;ince hateful in it &s;elf, and abominable to God and all good Men: But be&s;ides the Evil, &s;uch is the Folly and Vanity of this <HI>Vice,</HI> that tho the humorous and &s;elf-conceited Man has &s;eldom any thing to boa&s;t of, yet he's u&s;ually &s;o tran&s;ported with an Opi|nion and tow'ring Ambition of what he has, as to neglect a Supply of what is wanting; and being always attended with <HI>In&s;olence</HI> and <HI>Contempt</HI> of others, do's effectually bla&s;t and di&s;parage all other Vertues: For every Man is more inqui&s;itive after the <HI>Blemi&s;hes</HI> than <HI>Beau|ties</HI> of a proud Per&s;on; whereas the humble and mode&s;t Man may pa&s;s &s;ilent|ly and uncen&s;ured, with more real Faults and Indi&s;cretions.</P>
<P>Therefore have always a lowly and mode&s;t Opinion of your own <HI>Per&s;on, Quality, Acqui&s;itions, Merits</HI> and <HI>Endow|ments,</HI> both of <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Mind;</HI> and be content that others &s;hould have &s;o too: For why &s;hould any Man admire tho&s;e little Pittances of Learning, Know|ledge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;eeing they are not properly

<PB N="34" REF="22">and Habit of <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Mode|ration:</HI> For you'l hereby prevail with your &s;elf, not to indulge your <HI>Appetite,</HI> to the di&s;turbance and di&s;quiet of your rational Powers: Nor will any Man of Prudence and Sobriety endeavour to plea&s;e and gratifie his <HI>Palate</HI> with deli|cate <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks,</HI> nor his <HI>Touch</HI> with <HI>Softne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Effeminacy,</HI> nor his <HI>Eye</HI> with fair and gaudy <HI>Show's,</HI> nor his <HI>Smell</HI> with co&s;tly <HI>Perfumes:</HI> For an im|moderate <HI>Complyance</HI> with all or any of the&s;e, would not only force your <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> to quit her Dominion and Authority, and thereby hurry you into all manner of &s;in and wickedne&s;s, but continually di&s;tract your Thoughts, with a fruitle&s;s variety of Expectations and Di&s;appoint|ments. The ready way then to be at peace with God, and Man, and your own Con&s;cience, will be to govern your &s;elf according to the &s;ober <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation,</HI> as Gods <HI>Ho|ly Word</HI> and the <HI>Dictates</HI> of <HI>right Rea&s;on</HI> &s;hall direct you.</P>
<P>Now, the&s;e <HI>Vertues</HI> and their oppo|&s;ite <HI>Vices</HI> having the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
<PB N="35" REF="22">A&s;pect upon <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as the greate&s;t Examples either of Good or Evil; I &s;hall therefore be more particular in the hand|ling of this Point of <HI>Sobriety:</HI> And for the prevention of a Shipwrack of your Intere&s;t and Honour, (many thou&s;ands having &s;plit their <HI>Ve&s;&s;els</HI> upon this Rock,) give me leave to advi&s;e you in the</P>
<P>Fir&s;t place, To be very <HI>&s;ober and tem|perate</HI> in <HI>Eating.</HI> Have recour&s;e always to the foregoing Rules of <HI>Prudence,</HI> and they'l teach you to con&s;ult the Health &amp; Pre&s;ervation of the Body, that &s;o it may be the fitter Man&s;ion for your Soul: For 'tis always ob&s;ervable, that ungovern'd Lu&s;ts are the in&s;eparable Companions of intemperate <HI>Eating,</HI> and all other Sins are indulg'd and encourag'd by this Kind of <HI>Exce&s;s;</HI> whereas on the contrary, tho&s;e that live <HI>temperately</HI> and accor|ding to Rule, are &s;eldom tempted, or troubled, as the intemperate are, with &s;ickly and ill Humours, or deprived of the comforts and benefits of Health by raging and violent Di&s;tempers: For as a good Con&s;cience is the be&s;t Divinity,
<PB N="36" REF="23">&s;o Temperance is the be&s;t Phy&s;ick, and a good Expedient thro' Gods Ble&s;&s;ing, to pre&s;erve <HI>mentem &s;anam in Corpore &s;ano.</HI> And therefore if thro' inadvertency you &s;hould tran&s;gre&s;s at any one <HI>Meal,</HI> let no Temptation allure you to a &s;econd <HI>Repa&s;t,</HI> till by a fierce Hunger and Fa&s;t|ing, you find your &s;elf di&s;charg'd of the former <HI>Exce&s;s:</HI> By which means, your Under&s;tanding will be always clear, and your Con&s;titution firm and un&s;haken; e&s;pecially if you take care,</P>
<P>Secondly, To u&s;e the like <HI>moderation</HI> in <HI>Drinking,</HI> for your Health and Re|fre&s;hment, both as to the <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Quantity</HI> of <HI>Liquors.</HI> Your <HI>Prudence</HI> will ob&s;erve, that this is one of the reign|ing and epidemical Sins of the Nation, and an <HI>Inlet</HI> to mo&s;t other Sins, which many thou&s;ands (and tho&s;e generally none of the meane&s;t Rank,) make their chief Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s; and is of late Years become &s;o modi&s;h and fa&s;hiona|ble in all Entertainments, that the many will &s;carce think them&s;elves welcome, unle&s;s the Liquor and Freedom be al|lowed them to make Bea&s;ts of them|&s;elves:
<PB N="37" REF="23">One would think that their Quality and Education &s;hould reach 'em better Manners. But alas! they'l go further yet, and the mo&s;t which is yet a higher Aggravation of their Sin and Villany,) become the Devils Factors for Damnation; and u&s;e the mo&s;t ba&s;e and &s;ordid Methods, not only to debauch them&s;elves, but knock down others. But for the prevention of all <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> in this Kind, be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>That <HI>intemperate Drinking</HI> is the in|centive to, and fewel of all filthy Lu&s;ts: For Chambering and Wantonne&s;s is the u&s;ual Effect of Rioting and Drukenne&s;s, as the mo&s;t <HI>Debauchees</HI> find and feel by woful experience. This puts Men up|on de&s;perate Projects, and engages 'em in all &s;orts of Wickedne&s;s and Villany; in&s;omuch, that the very mo&s;t in their drunken Fits, will bla&s;pheme, &s;wear, cur&s;e, lie, backbite and rail again&s;t their innocent Neighbours, and do often kill and de&s;troy one another: For &s;ome of 'em are cut off by &s;udden <HI>Accidents,</HI> o|thers in <HI>Duels,</HI> occa&s;ion'd thro' <HI>Drink|ing;</HI> and not a few of tho&s;e <HI>guzling He|ctors</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="24">have &s;umm'd up their Days at the end of a <HI>Watchmans</HI> Bill. In a word, <HI>intemperate Drinking</HI> lays a &s;ure Foun|dation for all &s;orts of lingring Di&s;ea&s;es, makes the mo&s;t not only Bea&s;ts, but Mad-men, and either brings them (as I have noted to you,) to a &s;wift, untime|ly, and cruel <HI>Death,</HI> or a dete&s;table and infamous <HI>Old Age,</HI> (which not one in a thou&s;and ever attains to,) and tho&s;e that do, are offen&s;ive to all hone&s;t and vertuous Company, and to God the mo&s;t of all: And be&s;ides the&s;e tempo|ral Puni&s;hments, &s;ee their eternal <HI>Doom</HI> is detain'd already, if they live and die in this Sin unrepented of, and unre|form'd. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 5.11, 12. <HI>Luke</HI> 21.34. <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.21. Whereunto might be added many other parallel Pa&s;&s;ages to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations well weighed, might per&s;uade any Man to be ma&s;ter of his <HI>Appetite,</HI> and keep him&s;elf within the due bounds of <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Mo|deration;</HI> which would not only be an extraordinary Ble&s;&s;ing to private Per&s;ons and Families, but conduce very much
<PB N="39" REF="24">to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Publick:</HI> For I am confident, there's more Money &s;pent in one year in exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Drinking,</HI> than would very well provide for and main|tain all the truly poor and indigent People in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore as you tender the Welfare of your Per&s;on and Family, and Intere&s;t of your Soul and Body, in this and a &s;u|ture Life, avoid and abandon the Con|ver&s;ation and Company of all di&s;&s;olute, debauched and intemperate Per&s;ons: Let not their Allurements, nor Scoffings, nor Railings, per&s;uade you to a compli|ance with them in their inhumane and bea&s;tly <HI>Immoralities,</HI> &s;o as to <HI>run with them to the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot,</HI> 1 Pet. 4.4. For, they are the Devils In&s;tru|ments, whom he commonly imploys, to precipitate incon&s;iderate Youth from the Throne of Vertue: Be&s;ides, 'tis a mo&s;t infectious and bewitching <HI>Vice,</HI> in&s;omuch, that if a Man &s;hould once fall in love with, and contract a Habit of <HI>Drunkenne&s;s,</HI> 'twill be very difficult to &s;hake it off; for the longer it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth him, the more he will delight in it; and
<PB N="40" REF="25">the older he grows, the more bea&s;tly and &s;otti&s;h: Upon which account ma|ny have complain'd at the la&s;t Hour, that this &s;ingle Sin has been the cau&s;e of all their other Wickedne&s;&s;es, which they mu&s;t eternally &s;mart for.</P>
<P>I know the be&s;t of Men may &s;ome|times exceed the Boundaries of <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Temperance</HI> in <HI>Drinking:</HI> Now (Sir,) if ever it &s;hould be your Unhap|pine&s;s to be overtaken with this Fault, who&s;e Con&s;equences are &s;o mi&s;chievous, (which I be&s;eech you beware of;) do not remove from the place where you received it, except in &s;uch a place or company where the Danger may en|crea&s;e by your continuance therein; for hereby &s;ome part of the Inconveni|ence may be avoided, and more of the Shame and Scandal, always attending this giddy Spirit; which working in the Pate, will make one act all the Hu|mours habitual in a Mad-man. When you have obtain'd a Habit of <HI>Tempe|rance,</HI> in the moderate u&s;e of <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks,</HI> which are the proper Effects and Fruits of <HI>Prudence,</HI> the&s;e Vertues will di&s;po&s;e you:</P>
<PB N="41" REF="25">
<P>Thirdly, For the well-governing of the other Lu&s;ts and Appetites of the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> in your Ab&s;tinence from <HI>bodily Plea&s;ures.</HI> Now (Sir) you are under the mo&s;t forcible Obligations by the Laws of Nature and Chri&s;tianity, to a|void and ab&s;tain from all <HI>carnal Pollu|tions,</HI> and every kind and degree of <HI>Ef|feminacy:</HI> For unle&s;s you keep under your Appetite (as <HI>Prudence</HI> directs,) 'twill pre&s;ently &s;et on fire the whole Cour&s;e of Nature, and plunge both Soul and Body into mo&s;t de&s;perate, damna|ble, and irreparable Mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>For this kind of &s;inful <HI>Exce&s;s</HI> and <HI>Ex|travagance,</HI> &s;eldom or never fails to draw Men away from God and his Wor|&s;hip; which is ob&s;ervable in that deplo|rable In&s;tance of young King <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 11.12. who tells us from his own &s;ad Experience, (which might be a &s;ufficient Caution to all young Men,) that when they are once plung'd into tho&s;e <HI>Pits</HI> of <HI>Filthine&s;s,</HI> 'tis very difficult to retreat. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.22, 23. and <HI>Prov.</HI> 23.27. implying in both Pa&s;&s;ages, the great Perils and Dangers intempe|rate
<PB N="42" REF="26">rate Per&s;ons run upon, who will pro|&s;titute their Wit, Learning, Honour. E|&s;tates, and endanger their Souls, Bodies, and All, rather than not gratifie their bruti&s;h and un&s;atiable Lu&s;ts. This is not only the ca&s;e of this great Man be|fore us; for we have &s;een many &s;ad and mi&s;erable Spectacles even in our own Age of the decayed Bodies, &s;hatter'd E|&s;tates, and ruin'd Families, of many (otherwi&s;e hopeful) Young Gentlemen. And tho perhaps here and there one may e&s;cape the woful Effects of this Lewdne&s;s and Debauchery, for the pre|&s;ent,) yet without repentance and a|mendment of Life, Gods Judgments and Vengeance will certainly overtake them in another World: For <HI>Whoremongers</HI> and <HI>Adulterers</HI> God will judge; and who&s;oever dies under the reigning Pow|er and Prevalence of this Sin, &s;hall ne|ver enter into the Kingdom of God.</P>
<P>Therefore for God's &s;ake and your own, and as you tender the <HI>Weal</HI> of your <HI>Family,</HI> hold no <HI>Parley</HI> with your Ap|petite in this Ca&s;e; for if you do com|ply in the lea&s;t, you are in great danger
<PB N="43" REF="26">of being over-come. Set a &s;trict <HI>Guard</HI> then upon all your <HI>Sen&s;es,</HI> watch all the <HI>Ports</HI> and <HI>Avenues</HI> of your <HI>Soul</HI> again&s;t the incur&s;ion of carnal Temptations, and have God always in your thoughts: This was young <HI>Jo&s;ephs</HI> &s;ecurity again&s;t the lu&s;tful Temptations of his wanton and importunate <HI>Mi&s;tri&s;s;</HI> &s;o that by this means, if any evil Motions &s;hould creep in unawares, you'l not &s;uffer them to fix there; but either ca&s;t them out, or kill them.</P>
<P>U&s;e &s;trict <HI>Temperance</HI> (as we have per&s;uaded before,) with Fa&s;ting and Labour; all which are powerful <HI>Expe|dients</HI> to &s;ubjugate the <HI>Fle&s;h,</HI> and the be&s;t <HI>In&s;truments</HI> to further you in the great work and nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Mortification</HI> and <HI>Self-denial.</HI> And here|unto add your mo&s;t earne&s;t Prayers un|to God for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Grace, that you may obtain a comfortable Vi|ctory over your Appetites and Pa&s;&s;ions; which is a Duty &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that unle&s;s it be con&s;tantly and regular|ly perform'd, all your other Natural and Moral Indeavours will prove ineffe|ctual
<PB N="44" REF="27">and to no purpo&s;e. And thus your Chri&s;tian <HI>Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation</HI> in all the&s;e &s;everal <HI>In&s;tances,</HI> will further qualifie you,</P>
<P>Fourthly, For the exerci&s;e and im|provement of tho&s;e other excellent Ver|tues of <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> which you'l find of admirable u&s;e and advan|tage for the quiet and peaceable govern|ment of your whole Life; &s;o that your <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> will become not only plea|&s;ant, but delightful both to your &s;elf and others. Now the&s;e <HI>Vertues</HI> do eminent|ly con&s;i&s;t, in bearing and &s;uffering <HI>meek|ly</HI> and <HI>patiently</HI> all the cro&s;s Accidents (which you'l often meet with,) without fainting and fretting, and &s;uch an even|ne&s;s and compo&s;edne&s;s of Mind, as is only con&s;onant to the Mild and Gentle, yet magnanimous Temper and Spirit of <HI>Chri&s;tianity;</HI> and if all be thus well within, no Troubles nor Afflictions can vex nor di&s;compo&s;e you from without. Be&s;ides, when by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Grace you are form'd into this admira|ble Frame and Temper of Mind and Spi|rit, you'l neither be timorous in <HI>Dan|ger,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="27">envious in <HI>Want,</HI> impatient under <HI>Afflictions,</HI> angry or re&s;tle&s;s at <HI>Reproaches</HI> and <HI>Contempt,</HI> nor malicious and re|vengeful under <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts;</HI> but bear every cro&s;s Event with equa|nimity and a chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Will of God, in all Straits and Difficul|ties what&s;oever. And this is certainly the greatect Victory in the World, (and far beyond all the Conque&s;ts and At|chievements we ever read of,) for a Gentleman to be ma&s;ter of his own <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Hence therefore 'twill evidently ap|pear, how much tho&s;e Per&s;ons are to blame, who think it a piece of Honour in ca&s;e of <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts,</HI> to make the <HI>Sword</HI> Umpire of their own Life and others. And tho many great <HI>Fa|milies</HI> have paid dear for this <HI>Honour</HI> or <HI>Valour,</HI> (as they are plea&s;ed to call it,) yet I do not find it warranted either by <HI>Prudence</HI> or <HI>Religion,</HI> (as a worthy Gen|tleman ob&s;erves;) nor will any Man that is either wi&s;e or pious, either give or accept a <HI>Challenge:</HI> For no <HI>Quarrel</HI> can be &s;crewed up to that pitch of Indi&s;|cretion,
<PB N="46" REF="28">but one or both Parties mu&s;t be arraigned as guilty of the mo&s;t &s;tupen|dious Folly and Madne&s;s in the World. Be&s;ides, <HI>formal Duels</HI> are but a late In|vention of the Devil, and never heard of in former Times, as relating to private <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts;</HI> and 'tis mo&s;t cer|tain, that &s;ending of <HI>Challenges</HI> renders the Dead a greater Murderer than he that kills him, as being the immediate Author of his own Death: Nor are the&s;e inhumane and unchri&s;tian <HI>Practices</HI> &s;o genteilly treated by our <HI>Engli&s;h Laws,</HI> that any Man &s;hould be encouraged in this de&s;perate <HI>Attempt:</HI> For if the Mur|derers Legs, or his Friends procure not his Pardon or Reprieve, (tho he &s;hould not die in the Encounter, yet) he runs precipitantly upon his own Death, and his E&s;tate &s;hall be confi&s;cated too, to the perpetual detriment and undoing of his <HI>Family.</HI> Be&s;ides the <HI>Sting</HI> of <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> (if he has any Con&s;cience at all,) and a dreadful <HI>Fear</HI> like that of <HI>Cains,</HI> atten|ding Blood, will render the whole re|mainder of his Life tedious and mi&s;era|ble to &s;uch unfortunate Men; who will
<PB N="47" REF="28">ever after &s;mell too &s;trong of <HI>Blood,</HI> to be admitted into any intimate Friend|&s;hip or Relation.</P>
<P>Therefore in this Ca&s;e particularly, <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> are not only a Chri&s;tian Vertue, but the true&s;t Cou|rage and &s;ure&s;t Defen&s;ative again&s;t all <HI>Injuries</HI> and <HI>Affronts:</HI> And as the pra|ctice of the&s;e <HI>Vertues</HI> may probably qua|lifie the <HI>Heats</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> of any quar|rel&s;om and di&s;&s;olute <HI>Company</HI> you &s;hall happen to engage in, (tho take all po&s;|&s;ible care to avoid &s;uch <HI>Furies,</HI>) &s;o this excellent Frame and Temper of Mind and Spirit, will di&s;po&s;e you for a brighter Crown when the&s;e <HI>Storms</HI> are blown over. Again, The exerci&s;e and im|provement of this <HI>Chri&s;tian Prudence</HI> and <HI>Moderation, Meekne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> will further direct and enable you,</P>
<P>Fifthly, To be moderate in u&s;ing, and a good Husband in the management of that Patrimony and E&s;tate, which <HI>Gods Providence</HI> and the <HI>Di&s;cretion</HI> of your <HI>Parents</HI> have allotted you. Now 'tis ob&s;ervable, that Riches and Honours do expo&s;e Men to the greate&s;t <HI>Tempta|tions;</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="29">(and tho your pre&s;ent Circum|&s;tances do not require much Enlarge|ment upon this Head,) yet give me leave to remark to you, That 'tis a great fault and weakne&s;s in many <HI>Young Gentlemen,</HI> who cannot &s;ee the <HI>Pomps</HI> and <HI>Vanities</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> but they mu&s;t needs fall in love with them. The&s;e &s;eeming Beauties may and will tempt you (if po&s;&s;ible,) to <HI>Lewdne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Luxury;</HI> but 'tis your own fault if you be in&s;nared and led captive by them: Nor &s;hall you ever find any thing in tho&s;e vain <HI>Foole|ries,</HI> which will be able to &s;atisfie or plea&s;e your rational De&s;ires and Expe|ctations.</P>
<P>Yet I &s;hall readily grant you, that he whom God has ble&s;&s;ed with a plentiful E&s;tate, has many great Opportunities to do good both to him&s;elf and others; (for your direction herein, &s;ee the <HI>Gen|tleman's Calling</HI>): Nor can any Man of Rea&s;on and Piety (tho he be rich and honourable,) come under the Tempta|tions of being either Idle or Extravagant: For righteous <HI>Noah</HI> did in reality &s;ee two Worlds (before and after the De|luge,)
<PB N="49" REF="29">and yet was not polluted with the Vices or Vanities of either; vertu|ous <HI>Lot</HI> was holy and cha&s;t in the mid&s;t of <HI>Sodom;</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Hou&s;e kept clo&s;e to the God of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> &s;o did <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI> in the <HI>Syrian</HI> Court, and <HI>Daniel</HI> and others among the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> &amp;c. Your Danger or Safety then, mu&s;t &s;low from a Principle within you: For tho the Devil and the World may and will tempt, yet they have no power to con|&s;train you: Nor can any thing ever make a Man unhappy, but a voluntary compliance with tho&s;e Temptations, and the ba&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions of his own &s;la|vi&s;h Appetite. Be prudent and mode|rate therefore in di&s;po&s;ing of your <HI>Mo|ney</HI> (both now and always); for if you &s;pend <HI>too high,</HI> you'l incur the Cen&s;ure of <HI>Prodigality</HI> or <HI>Epicuri&s;m;</HI> and if <HI>too low,</HI> either of unbecoming <HI>Niggardline&s;s,</HI> or fordid <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> Which (as an ingenious Per&s;on ob&s;erves,) is like a Candle ill made, and &s;mothers the &s;plen|dour of a happy Fortune in its own Grea&s;e.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="30">
<P>Sixthly, Be moderate al&s;o in your <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Apparel;</HI> let it not be youth|fully wanton, but grave and comely, like the Mind and Behaviour of the Wearer. But do not by any means ex|ceed in the Humour of Bravery: For our <HI>Clothes</HI> &s;hould rather humble, than puff us up, being always the vi&s;ible <HI>En|&s;igns</HI> of our Sin and Slavery; nor &s;hall any Man be e&s;teemed for this <HI>&s;ort of Ex|travagance,</HI> but by Fools and Wantons.</P>
<P>Seventhly, I &s;hall but add one <HI>Con&s;i|deration</HI> more, and that will be of gene|ral u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ary importance, in the prudent, moderate, patient, peaceable and chri&s;tian Conduct of your whole life; which will render your Conver&s;a|tion plea&s;ant and profitable to your &s;elf, and acceptable to all vertuous and good Men. And this will be the di&s;|creet and con&s;cientious Management of all your <HI>Thoughts, Words</HI> and <HI>Actions.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, For the government of your <HI>Thoughts.</HI> Now (Sir,) if you be care|ful and re&s;erved, &s;o as not (willingly) to conceive or fo&s;ter an evil <HI>Thought,</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="30">you'l then be afraid to <HI>&s;peak,</HI> or <HI>act</HI> a|ny thing contrary to your own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience. And to this End <HI>think</HI> often (as before) of the <HI>quatuor Novi&s;|&s;ima,</HI> Death and Judgment, Heaven and Hell; which thro the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Grace, may keep all the &s;inful Excur&s;i|ons of your Thoughts under &s;o much re&s;traint, as you'l not readily and wil|lingly conceive any thing that &s;hall be either &s;inful or irregular. And this will be an excellent Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Secondly, For the Government of the <HI>Tongue,</HI> which &s;hould be always kept under a &s;trict guard: For <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, That Life and Death are in the power of it. And <HI>Euripides</HI> truly affirms, That every licentious and unbridled <HI>Tongue</HI> &s;hall in the end find it &s;elf unfortunate: For we &s;ee by daily experience, that all <HI>Quarrels, Mi&s;chief, Hatred,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> ari&s;eth from unadvi&s;ed <HI>Speech;</HI> and in much <HI>Talking</HI> there are many Errours, from which your Enemies will take the mo&s;t dangerous Advantage. Be&s;ides, all &s;currilous, fro|thy, profane, idle, uncharitable, filthy,

La|ment and deplore your pa&s;t Failings, and humbly beg the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Grace and Spirit, that you may be more watch|ful over your &s;elf and ways for the fu|ture. Now the be&s;t and mo&s;t certain Means to avoid <HI>greater Sins,</HI> is to make Con&s;cience of the <HI>le&s;s:</HI> (For the <HI>lea&s;t Sin</HI> is damnable in the &s;ight of God); and when the work of Regeneration is wrought in you, beware of Relap&s;ing; con&s;ider the dangers of habitual Sin and Apo&s;ta&s;ie from Grace, and exert all your Endeavours to live in the exerci&s;e of a Con&s;cience void of offence both towards God and Man: For &s;o the whole Time of your &s;hort aboad in this World, will be plea&s;ant and comfortable, and your Death happy.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome other little things I de&s;ire to note to you before I leave this <HI>Point.</HI> And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Beware of <HI>Swimming,</HI> which you'l probably be allured to in tho&s;e <HI>Low Countries,</HI> the mo&s;t being dexte|rous in that Art: For tho it may &s;ave a Mans Life in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, yet a
<PB N="56" REF="33">vain Curro&s;ity herein may expo&s;e you to the greate&s;t Dangers and Hazards. Therefore if you &s;hould attempt it for your Plea&s;ure, exceed not your own Depth; and in &s;eeking to &s;ave another, have a care you drown not your <HI>&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Your <HI>Ge&s;ture and Deport|ment</HI> &s;hould neither be light, nor in&s;o|lent, nor wanton: For the Life and Soul of true Honour, is in generous Qualities, and a mode&s;t and affable <HI>Carriage;</HI> but yet with a comely re|gard to your &s;elf, and &s;uch as becomes a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> who&s;e Mind is furni&s;hed with worthy and generous Spirits.

Yet be careful to avoid the other <HI>Ex|treme</HI> of affected <HI>Ea&s;ine&s;s</HI> or <HI>Compliance,</HI>
<PB N="57" REF="33">le&s;t your good Di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be im|po&s;ed upon by others <HI>Deceit,</HI> and your own too much <HI>Credulity:</HI> For too much <HI>Familiarity</HI> and <HI>Fawning</HI> is always re|warded either with <HI>Flattery</HI> or <HI>Con|tempt.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, What concerns your <HI>Bodily Deportment, Wre&s;tling, Fencing,</HI> and other Feats of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Military Skill;</HI> and how far all or any of the&s;e are expe|dient or nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood or practi&s;ed, I mu&s;t leave to your &s;elf, and better Judgments, for Advice and Di|rection; for the&s;e are not my <HI>Pro|vince.</HI></P>
<P>What other <HI>Vertues</HI> or <HI>Vices</HI> may occur in your Conver&s;ation with o|thers, (which my de&s;igned Brevity and the Occa&s;ion I write upon, have per&s;ua|ded me to omit,) you &s;hould note and ob&s;erve them, and make that u&s;e of them, at lea&s;t to improve and correct your own: For what you di&s;like or admire in others, &s;tudy and endeavour to avoid the Evil, and &s;trive to imitate what is vertuous and commendable.

<HEAD>ADVICE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN Of an Honourable FAMILY Now in His TRAVELS Beyond the SEA'S, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> PART III. <HI>Of RELIGION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Religion</HI> is the grand Concernment that all of us are &s;ent into the World to mind;
<PB N="60" REF="35">and our eternal <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> or <HI>Mi&s;ery</HI> de|pends on the right <HI>knowing</HI> and <HI>ac|knowledging</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>mi&s;takes</HI> about it. We had need therefore be very ac|curate in the choice of that <HI>Religion</HI> we intend to live and die in, and venture our eternal Salvation upon.</P>
<P>Now, there are many <HI>Opinions</HI> in the World concerning <HI>Religion;</HI> and we may be ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on and delu|ded, if we make not a prudent and wi&s;e <HI>Choice.</HI> I &s;hall not trouble you with an account of <HI>Heatheni&s;m, Mahometa|ni&s;m,</HI> and <HI>Judai&s;m:</HI> For the&s;e are all <HI>fal&s;e Religions,</HI> and contrary to the whole <HI>&s;cope</HI> and <HI>de&s;ign</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> which being without the Lines of Chri&s;tian Communication, we leave 'em to them&s;elves and the righteous Judgment of God. We <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> know no other way to Salvation but <HI>One,</HI> and that's by <HI>Faith</HI> in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and there|fore we think our &s;elves obliged to be|lieve the <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> with all our Hearts, and <HI>live</HI> according to them: For there's no other name un|der Heaven whereby we can expect or
<PB N="61" REF="35">hope for Salvation, but the Name of our Lord <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> Acts 4.12.</P>
<P>Yet there are many <HI>Differences,</HI> not only <HI>Circum&s;tantial</HI> but <HI>Fundamental,</HI> even among&s;t tho&s;e that are called <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> which di&s;turb the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and ruine the <HI>Souls</HI> of many private <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> as will appear more ful|ly afterwards. But 'tis more immedi|ately my De&s;ign to recommend to you, and inforce the <HI>Belief</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> of the truly Primitive and Reformed <HI>Re|ligion,</HI> as now &s;olemnly and publickly profe&s;s'd, and by <HI>Law</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I have not the lea&s;t cau&s;e to doubt or &s;u&s;pect, but that your <HI>Parents</HI> did &s;e|riou&s;ly weigh and con&s;ider (when they &s;ent you abroad,) the <HI>Minority</HI> of your <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Judgment;</HI> which (yet) with|out your own extraordinary care and caution, may hurry you unawares into the peril of <HI>Mi&s;carriage.</HI> For alas! how many young <HI>Gentlemen</HI> have lo&s;t their Hopes and them&s;elves in <HI>Foreign Ad|ventures,</HI> and return'd home as empty of Grace and other vertuous Accompli&s;h|ments,
<PB N="62" REF="36">as full of Words, Vanity, and other vitious Habits and Inclinations? Now (Sir,) if you &s;hould unhappily <HI>Mi&s;carry,</HI> which the Lord of his great Mercy prevent; as it would be the greate&s;t <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> to your <HI>&s;elf;</HI> &s;o not only your <HI>Parents</HI> hopes of your <HI>Youth,</HI> but the Staff and Comfort of their <HI>Age</HI> will lie a bleeding, to their unexpre&s;&s;i|ble <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Sorrow.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Con&s;iderations</HI> have very much affected me, which I took the freedom to mention to &s;ome of your Friends, when I fir&s;t heard of their De&s;ign of &s;ending you beyond <HI>Sea;</HI> and upon more due and &s;erious deliberation, do now with more con&s;idence (yet hum|bly) communicate my Thoughts to you upon the&s;e <HI>Subjects:</HI> For I am very well a&s;&s;ured, (that con&s;idering me as a <HI>Di|vine</HI> and <HI>True Friend,</HI>) I &s;hall not incur the lea&s;t <HI>&s;u&s;picion</HI> of being (herein) too bold or pre&s;umptuous; and will think my &s;elf &s;ufficiently apaid, if thro God's Ble&s;&s;ing, I may be an happy In&s;trument in doing the lea&s;t good to your <HI>Soul.</HI> I know it would be the greate&s;t Happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="63" REF="36">to your <HI>&s;elf,</HI> as well as a Comfort to all your <HI>Friends,</HI> if you be per&s;uaded by any <HI>means</HI> to fall in love with <HI>Re|ligion</HI> betimes, and <HI>remember your Cre|ator in the Days of your Youth,</HI> Eccle&s;. 12.1. This has been for many Ages the glory and &s;upport of your Family, which has been always eminent for Re|ligion and Loyalty; nor could there ever be le&s;s Danger of a degenerous Heir, (not to &s;latter you Sir, nor puff you up,) nor greater Hopes of its e&s;ta|bli&s;hment to future Generations.</P>
<P>But before we come to the Point, give me leave to note to you (for your greater Security,) That you'l be in danger of meeting with many <HI>Brokers</HI> of <HI>Villany,</HI> who&s;e Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s it is to pervert, and do live upon the Spoils and Ruins of <HI>Young Gentlemen;</HI> in&s;omuch that &s;carce any Per&s;on of your Quality can travel into <HI>Foreign Parts,</HI> but he &s;hall be mightily care&s;s'd, and treated with &s;o much re&s;pect and civility, as if it were a plea&s;ure to be <HI>&s;educed.</HI> We know very well what <HI>Stratagems</HI> are u&s;ed by &s;ome Men, to
<PB N="64" REF="37">undermine the &s;acred <HI>Foundations</HI> of the <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> in&s;omuch that (before his <HI>Ma|je&s;ties Declaration of Indulgence</HI>) neither <HI>Laws</HI> nor <HI>Penalties</HI> could re&s;train them. What then will they not dare to attempt within their own Territories and Juri&s;|dictions, e&s;pecially when they meet with Per&s;ons of Temper and Quality, who are inclin'd and di&s;pos'd (as you are) to <HI>Religion?</HI> And &s;eeing al&s;o they have not only free &s;cope and priviledge, but encouragement to &s;educe; &s;o, that 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible not to be a&s;&s;aulted (at lea&s;t) by their clo&s;e and cunning In|&s;inuations.</P>
<P>There have been, ala&s;s! too many perverted already; the lo&s;s of whom joyned with the Churches, we have &s;ufficient cau&s;e to lament: And indeed 'tis a great wonder we have lo&s;t no more, (and let us prai&s;e God for it,) con|&s;idering the importunate <HI>Methods</HI> and <HI>Plau&s;iblene&s;s</HI> of our <HI>Adver&s;aries,</HI> on the right hand and on the left; who like tho&s;e infected with the <HI>Plague,</HI> have always an itching de&s;ire of tainting
<PB N="65" REF="37">others. Wherefore none can blame the Clergy of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> if we be as zealous for Truth, as our Adver&s;a|ries of Fal&s;hood; which Argument a|lone might be a &s;ufficient <HI>Apology</HI> for this Undertaking.</P>
<P>I have read (Sir) of &s;ome <HI>Countries</HI> (I wi&s;h your Curio&s;ity may not carry you thither) who&s;e chief Vertues (mo|de&s;tly &s;peaking,) do very much border either on Impiety or Super&s;tition; and yet tho&s;e very Places (as <HI>Travellers</HI> ob|&s;erve,) which are mo&s;t worth &s;eeing, are of all others the mo&s;t contagious. Now 'tis no &s;mall difficulty for a Young Gentleman to be cha&s;t and vertuous in the mid&s;t of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and few have tra|vell'd thither, however they may plea&s;e them&s;elves with variety of <HI>Objects,</HI> and returned home without &s;ome dangerous Tincture, either of Sin and Wickedne&s;s, or Schi&s;m and Sedition.</P>
<P>Thus I have noted in general, what <HI>Temptations</HI> and <HI>Hazards</HI> you are ex|po&s;ed to among&s;t <HI>Foreigners;</HI> and the greate&s;t of all is, the danger of being corrupted and contaminated in your
<PB N="66" REF="38"><HI>Religion and Manners:</HI> And 'tis certain, tho your <HI>Tutors</HI> be never &s;o careful, yet much mu&s;t be left to your own Temper and Inclination, how to &s;ever Good from Evil: For there's no Man proves Facti|ous, Super&s;titious, or extreamly Wicked on a &s;udden, but thro &s;everal Declinati|ons, falls by degrees from Vertue and Religion. Seeing then &s;o many Tem|ptations and Snares may await you in e|very Place where you come, (which no Mans Prudence can fore&s;ee,) and your own Heart prove deceitful and forward to betray you: Therefore I be&s;eech you, be con&s;tantly upon your Guard; and if your <HI>Tutors</HI> &s;hould either be negligent or per&s;idious, (as many have been in the like Tru&s;t, and I could name &s;ome of them,) yet thro the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God's Grace, you may &s;ecure your <HI>Re|ligion</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> inviolable.</P>
<P>But for the further prevention of their <HI>Machinations,</HI> who lie in wait to deceive, and your E&s;tabli&s;hment and Confirmati|on in the Religion of the <HI>Church of Eng|land,</HI> I offer the&s;e Three following <HI>Par|ticulars</HI> to your &s;erious and impartial <HI>Con&s;ideration.</HI> And,</P>
<PB N="67" REF="38">
<P>Fir&s;t, I &s;hall give you a true (tho &s;hort) Account of the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both as to her Doctrin and Wor&s;hip, or Di&s;cipline; which I hope may for ever oblige you to continue in her <HI>Communion.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, We &s;hall enquire a little into the Principles and Practices of the <HI>Romi&s;h Church</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> wherein they chiefly differ from <HI>&V;s:</HI> A Religi|on of all others (within the Pail of the Chri&s;tian Church,) the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and delightful to Fle&s;h and Blood: A Religion which no Man &s;carce can com|ply with; e&s;pecially if he has been bred up in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> but mu&s;t offer violence to his own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, if he pretends to either.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We &s;hall con&s;ider the <HI>Pre|ten&s;ions, Rea&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> which our Brethren of the <HI>Non-conformity</HI> have urged in their own Defence, to palliate their <HI>Separation</HI> from our <HI>Communion,</HI> and &s;educe others: By all which, I hope 'twill evidently appear, that there can|not be the lea&s;t colour of Rea&s;on, nor any thing like Argument to tempt, much
<PB N="68" REF="39">le&s;s to per&s;uade you, or any other Per|&s;on of Parts and Education, (who is not blinded with Pa&s;&s;ion, Intere&s;t or Preju|dice,) to &s;eparate from the mo&s;t truly Orthodox, and be&s;t con&s;tituted Church in the whole World; I mean the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Of all the&s;e &s;everally. And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Of the <HI>Religion</HI> of our <HI>Church,</HI> both as to its <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> or <HI>Di&s;cipline.</HI> And Fir&s;t, Concerning her <HI>Doctrin:</HI> Wherein 'tis mo&s;t plain and evident, That we have a clear Profe&s;&s;i|on of all <HI>Fundamental Truths</HI> and <HI>Du|ties,</HI> both to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> in our <HI>Creeds, Commandments, Lords Prayer,</HI> and the Doctrin of the <HI>Two Sacraments;</HI> which every Orthodox and Believing Chri&s;ti|an in the whole World, will readily &s;ub|&s;cribe, and &s;ay <HI>Amen</HI> to.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Sabbaths</HI> are duly ob&s;erved and kept, with the greate&s;t Reverence and Solemnity. God's <HI>Holy Word</HI> is pure|ly and faithfully preach'd; his <HI>Sacra|ments</HI> duly admini&s;tred, according to our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviours own In&s;titution. We wor&s;hip <HI>God,</HI> viz. the <HI>One Divine E&s;&s;ence,</HI> and <HI>Trinity</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> in Spirit
<PB N="69" REF="39">and Truth; in and thro' Chri&s;t, with|out the Mediation of Saints and Angels. We hope for, and believe the <HI>Remi&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Sins,</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> of our <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Bodies,</HI> by the Merits of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> alone, thro' the Mercies of <HI>God,</HI> and upon the condition of a &s;incere and un&s;eigned <HI>Re|pentance:</HI> Which <HI>Repentance</HI> in the Judgment of our <HI>Church,</HI> implies a true <HI>Sight</HI> and <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of, hearty <HI>arrow</HI> for, and the <HI>hatred</HI> and <HI>for&s;aking</HI> of all our former <HI>Sins;</HI> with a &s;tedfa&s;t <HI>Re&s;olu|tion</HI> never to return to them again, with any <HI>con&s;ent, delight</HI> or <HI>approbation,</HI> and the u&s;e of all po&s;&s;ible <HI>Endeavours</HI> to put the&s;e <HI>Re&s;olutions</HI> in practice, even to our Lives End: So, that if we &s;hall at a|ny time fall into the commi&s;&s;ion of the lea&s;t <HI>Sin,</HI> or the neglect of any <HI>Duty,</HI> either wilfully, or by infirmity and &s;ur|prize; we do again &s;eriou&s;ly and &s;o|lemnly renew our <HI>Repentance,</HI> and are never at peace with our Selves and in our Con&s;ciences, till we be again re|conciled unto God, or our Neighbour, whom we have offended. And this we do as well after as before our Conver|&s;ion;
<PB N="70" REF="40">not daring to continue in any <HI>one &s;in unrepented of, unreformed.</HI></P>

<P>To &s;ay nothing of their <HI>School Points</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ui&s;tical Divinity,</HI> 'tis evident that their whole <HI>Religion</HI> is only the bare &s;hadow and out&s;ides of <HI>Chri&s;tia|nity,</HI> and meer <HI>Pageantry</HI> and <HI>Forma|lity</HI> of <HI>Devotion:</HI> For ala&s;s! their poor &s;imple and ignorant <HI>Laity,</HI> &s;ay, hear, and do they know not what, and re|turn from their Churches as void of In&s;truction, and Chri&s;tian Admonition and Edification, as when they went; and yet for all this, (which is the high|e&s;t aggravation of their Sin and Mi&s;ery,) they are obliged to believe, that this their blind <HI>Devotion</HI> is not only <HI>accep|table</HI> but <HI>meritorious.</HI> Be&s;ides, how ma|ny
<PB N="87" REF="48">notorious and damnable <HI>Sins</HI> pa&s;s for <HI>Venial,</HI> and how ea&s;ily are they atton'd for? In&s;omuch that a few <HI>Drops</HI> of <HI>Holy Water,</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> upon their <HI>Brea&s;ts</HI> or <HI>Foreheads,</HI> will throughly wa&s;h off the <HI>Stain,</HI> (according to their groundle&s;s Apprehen&s;ions,) and expiate the guilt of all their heinous and cry|ing <HI>Sins.</HI> Their notorious <HI>Equivoca|tions</HI> have &s;carce left any room for Truth, whereby they deceive others, and offer violence to their own Con|&s;ciences. But tho poor ignorant and unwary Souls may be impo&s;ed upon and deluded, yet it cannot be &s;o with an All-&s;eeing God; who will one day convince all Men, and expo&s;e their So|phi&s;tical <HI>Villanies</HI> and <HI>Re&s;ervations</HI> to the open and publick view both of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Now this Liberty and Indulgence of theirs is &s;o plea&s;ing and acceptable to &s;en&s;ual and carnal <HI>Men,</HI> that 'tis no great wonder that they gain &s;o many Pro&s;elytes to their Party, as &s;ome do pre&s;umptuou&s;ly and vainly boa&s;t. But then if we give our &s;elves the trouble
<PB N="88" REF="49">to enquire what &s;ort of Per&s;ons they are whom they have perverted; we &s;hall find, that many of 'em are &s;illy Women and Men notoriou&s;ly debauch|ed, or ignorant, or of mercenary Spirits, who expect <HI>Preferment</HI> in that Way. And therefore we have no great cau&s;e to regret the lo&s;s of them; and if our number be le&s;s, yet we are not the wor&s;e: For if all our Licentious <HI>Hypo|crites</HI> and <HI>Malefactors,</HI> who are not worthy to live in the World, &s;hould go over to their Communion, we &s;hall have no great cau&s;e to complain.</P>
<P>But alas! the&s;e erroneous <HI>Principles</HI> and wor&s;e <HI>Practices</HI> of the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> who being the more intelligent and judici|ous &s;ort of that Communion, cannot be &s;o much the error and mi&s;take of their Judgments, as the perver&s;ene&s;s of their Wills: And tho a &s;imple and ig|norant <HI>Popeling,</HI> who lies under &s;uch Temptations and Obligations, (as be|fore,) may be &s;aved; yet I am afraid, the more Learned and Di&s;creet having made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Con&s;cience, are in a very dangerous
<PB N="89" REF="49">State, if they live and die according to tho&s;e corrupt Principles; becau&s;e they are in the number of tho&s;e dam|nable <HI>Here&s;ies</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> &s;peaks of.</P>
<P>What I have already offer'd, are <HI>Truths</HI> as clear as the Sun; nor can a|ny thing in the World be more <HI>de|mon&s;trative</HI> to a <HI>Per&s;on</HI> throughly ac|quainted with the <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Pra|ctices</HI> of <HI>Popery.</HI> And yet for all this, 'tis a thou&s;and to one you'l meet with &s;ome bold and cunning <HI>Sophi&s;ters,</HI> who'l tell you a great many plau&s;ible <HI>Stories,</HI> and endeavour to elude the mo&s;t clear and convincing <HI>Rea&s;ons,</HI> which can be urg'd again&s;t them; whereby they do &s;trangely impo&s;e upon, and many times entrap poor ignorant and unwary <HI>Souls.</HI> To in&s;tance in &s;ome <HI>Particulars:</HI> And,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A <HI>Catholick</HI> (&s;ay they,) &s;o li|ving and dying, even by the Confe&s;&s;i|on of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> them&s;elves, may be &s;aved. [Which is a confe&s;&s;ed Argu|ment of our <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Moderation.</HI>]</P>
<P>Secondly, That the <HI>One Church</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> is more likely to be found in all
<PB N="90" REF="50"><HI>World,</HI> than in a <HI>Corner.</HI> [As if there were no true Church in the World, but theirs.]</P>
<P>Thirdly, In all Ages than of later Years. [Not con&s;idering that we had a Chri&s;tian Church in <HI>England,</HI> before ever <HI>Popery</HI> was known in the World.]</P>
<P>Fourthly, That this <HI>One Church</HI> is ra|ther to be found in <HI>&V;nity,</HI> than in <HI>Di|vi&s;ion.</HI> [Which we could ea&s;ily recri|minate and retort upon them&s;elves: For there are more and greater <HI>Schi&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> than in any other <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> what|&s;oever.]</P>
<P>Fifthly, That they have a <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> from the Days of the <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> downward. [So have we, as is fully evident from all our Antient and Authentick <HI>Records.</HI> See Bi&s;hop <HI>Bamhal</HI>'s Account of the <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome.</HI> And they have quite forgotten that there were three <HI>Popes,</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> at the &s;ame time: What then became of their uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion?</P>
<PB N="91" REF="50">
<P>Sixthly, That the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> is the <HI>Supreme Head</HI> of the <HI>Church &V;ni|ver&s;al,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;ts Vicar</HI> in extraordi|nary upon <HI>Earth.</HI> [Which &s;purious <HI>Title</HI> and <HI>&V;&s;urpation,</HI> (as we noted be|fore,) is rejected by at lea&s;t two parts of the <HI>Catholick Church</HI> at this day, and di&s;liked by &s;ome <HI>National Churches</HI> (as 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed) of their own Communi|on; who are inclinable enough (if they knew but how) to ca&s;t off that Papal and Tyrannical Yoke.]</P>
<P>Seventhly, That the <HI>Church of Eng|land</HI> is only a Branch lopt off, or a Rag torn from the <HI>Coat,</HI> and that we had no <HI>Church</HI> nor <HI>Religion</HI> before <HI>Luther.</HI> [This is a mo&s;t gro&s;s and manife&s;t <HI>&V;n|truth:</HI> For we had a <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> in <HI>England</HI> before ever St. <HI>Peter</HI> came at <HI>Rome,</HI> founded by <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arima|thea,</HI> and flouri&s;hed under King <HI>Lucius,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian Monarch</HI> in the World. And we know very well by what <HI>&V;&s;ur|pations</HI> and <HI>Encroachments,</HI> and the time when <HI>Popery</HI> fir&s;t got footing in <HI>Eng|land;</HI> that <HI>Augu&s;tin</HI> the <HI>Monk,</HI> cau&s;ed &s;ome hundreds of that Order to be &s;lain
<PB N="92" REF="51">at <HI>Bangor,</HI> to make way for it: And 'tis further evident by what Means and Me|thods the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> did work up|on the Weakne&s;&s;es and Credulity of &s;ome, and the Nece&s;&s;ities of others of our <HI>Chri&s;tian Princes,</HI> not having the Power, or Courage, or Re&s;olution, to ca&s;t off the <HI>Popes Supremacy,</HI> till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, King of <HI>England:</HI> A Per&s;on who&s;e <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Affairs</HI> (let our <HI>Adver&s;aries</HI> be&s;patter him as they plea&s;e,) made him a fit <HI>In|&s;trument</HI> to begin the <HI>Reformation;</HI> which thro' God's <HI>Providence,</HI> and the prudent and religious Conduct of his <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> has been happily carried on and perfected; which we hope thro' the Favour and Protection of his Sa|cred Maje&s;ty who now Reigns, may be continued a Ble&s;&s;ing to <HI>&V;s</HI> and our <HI>Po&s;terity.</HI>]</P>
<P>Hence therefore 'twill appear to you, That the&s;e are all thred-bare and &s;tale <HI>Eva&s;ions</HI> and <HI>Subter&s;uges,</HI> to colour and palliate their groundle&s;s and unrea&s;ona|ble Pretences to <HI>Antiquity, Vi&s;ibility, &V;nity, Magnificence,</HI> Right of <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="51">of, and in their Church: All which have been an&s;wered at lea&s;t an hundred times, by Worthy and Learned <HI>Authors,</HI> as you'l &s;ee afterwards. But this <HI>Controver|&s;ie</HI> has been &s;o well &s;tated and through|ly canva&s;&s;ed by our <HI>Church of England Men</HI> in the&s;e la&s;t three Years, that there will be more difficulty now than ever, to per&s;uade any Gentleman of Sen&s;e and Ingenuity to believe their incongruous and hateful Ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>But yet there are &s;ome others of the &s;ame Foot-mark, who having laid a&s;ide all Mode&s;ty and Candour, their Fore|heads are &s;o &s;teel'd with Confidence, as to affirm, That we have neither <HI>Church, Prie&s;ts, Sacraments,</HI> nor <HI>Religi|on</HI> among&s;t <HI>&V;s;</HI> and are &s;o uncharitable as to load <HI>&V;s</HI> with all the non&s;en&s;ical and unju&s;t Calumnies imaginable, not regarding what they are, &s;o they be but &s;piteful and malicious; ob&s;erving the old Maxim, <HI>Fortiter calumniari aliquid haerebit.</HI> Nay, they'l even di&s;claim their own <HI>Popi&s;h Doctrins</HI> and <HI>Practices,</HI> as the <HI>Invocation of Saints, Wor&s;hiping of Ima|ges,</HI> &amp;c. and do tell the credulous Peo|ple,
<PB N="94" REF="52">that their Adver&s;aries out of meer Spight and Malice, do mi&s;repre&s;ent them.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Methods</HI> have been lately u&s;ed (by an Eminent Papi&s;t here of my Ac|quaintance and Neighborhood,) to &s;ome Per&s;ons of our <HI>Communion</HI> who were for|merly my Pari&s;hioners, and &s;eem'd to be warping towards <HI>Popery:</HI> They ac|quainted me with it, and look'd upon tho&s;e <HI>Sophi&s;ms</HI> to be nervous and &s;trong Arguments and Motives, (and &s;o in|deed they were if they had been true,) to per&s;uade them to change their Re|ligion. But &s;uch &s;huffling Tricks as the&s;e carry their own Confutation a|long with them; for this is an old piece of <HI>Legerdemain,</HI> which one would have thought &s;hould have been long &s;ince exploded. And I find the very &s;ame <HI>Hocus pocus,</HI> Illu&s;ions, u&s;ed by the <HI>Po|pi&s;h Prie&s;ts,</HI> about the beginning of the Reign of Q. <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> For we know very well, what Priviledges are allow'd them to &s;wear and for&s;wear; and not only deny, but even rail again&s;t their own received <HI>Doctrins, Practices, Church,</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="52">and the <HI>Pope</HI> him&s;elf, for the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Catholick (i. e.)</HI> the <HI>Roman Religi|on.</HI> Con&s;ult Dr. <HI>Nal&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Foxes and Firebrands,</HI> and there you'l find many of their jugling Devices, and being Men of Latitude and Faculties to prepare Di&s;hes for every Palate.</P>
<P>I have been a little more expre&s;s in &s;tating the&s;e <HI>Differences,</HI> becau&s;e I know tho&s;e <HI>Popi&s;h Emi&s;&s;aries</HI> are crept into all Countreys, and do every where lie in wait to debauch and corrupt Young Gentlemen, both in their <HI>Principles</HI> and <HI>Manners.</HI> There are not a few In&s;tan|ces of both, who have been taken Cap|tives by them: I &s;hall name Two parti|cularly. The one a Per&s;on of good <HI>Qua|lity,</HI> &s;trong and quick natural <HI>Parts,</HI> an excellent <HI>Scholar,</HI> under the Conduct (as 'twas &s;uppo&s;ed,) of a well qualified <HI>Tutor,</HI> well educated according to the <HI>Church of England,</HI> by his pious and prudent Parents; and yet for all this, was perverted in his <HI>Travels,</HI> and con|tinues a zealous and cunning <HI>Papi&s;t.</HI> There was another Gentleman al&s;o, both of my Acquaintance, not inferior to the
<PB N="96" REF="53">former, and every way as well fitted for Travel, yet did contract &s;uch a habit of <HI>Lewdne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Debauchery,</HI> (to &s;ay no wor&s;e,) that in few years an <HI>E&s;tate</HI> of a|bove 2000 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> is intirely wa&s;t|ed, and nothing remains but a bare puff of Honour without any E&s;tate to &s;upport it: I could tell you all the particulars by what Methods that unfortunate, &s;weet, and ingenuous Young Gentleman was allured and trapan'd into the&s;e <HI>Mi&s;chiefs,</HI> who al&s;o died immaturely, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which <HI>Examples</HI> among&s;t many others, have been often in my Thoughts: And tho there be not the lea&s;t grounds of any Jealou&s;ie or Su&s;pition of your Mi&s;carri|age, yet I have &s;et them in your View as Land Marks, and Sea Marks, to prevent the danger of &s;plitting your Ve&s;&s;el, (&s;o well built and richly laden,) either upon the Sands and Shelves of <HI>Debauchery</HI> and <HI>Prophanene&s;s,</HI> or the Rocks and Splinters of <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> and <HI>Super&s;tition.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore (Dear Sir) let me be&s;eech you once more to be continually upon your Watch, that you may return with the &s;ame Soul and &s;ame Body you car|ried
<PB N="97" REF="53">from hence, and all the Tempers and Di&s;po&s;itions of both. And for this End endeavor throughly to under&s;tand, and then live up to the Principles and Rules of that Religion you have hither|to profe&s;s'd. This will prove the be&s;t An|tidote again&s;t that de&s;tructive <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> which might otherwi&s;e taint and infect both your <HI>Intellectuals</HI> and <HI>Morals;</HI> and not only de&s;troy the Chri&s;tian, but even the Man (or rational part) within you.</P>
<P>Let me advi&s;e you &s;till more <HI>particular|ly,</HI> not &s;o much as to lend an <HI>Ear</HI> to hear, nor a <HI>Tongue</HI> to di&s;cour&s;e with tho&s;e in|chanting <HI>Syrens;</HI> be afraid of their &s;eem|ing Favours, who&s;e Errand is Deceit, and under the pretence of Kindne&s;s and Re|&s;pect, will wound you to the very Heart. Look not upon the pompous Ceremonies and co&s;tly Ornaments of that <HI>Religion</HI> wherein all things are outwardly glori|ous and plea&s;ant to the Eye; but keep clo&s;e to innocent Truth, and let your <HI>Soul</HI> be always deeply affected with that Wor|&s;hip who&s;e Maje&s;ty is in the Heart, not in the Face, which we profe&s;s (with the greate&s;t comfort and &s;atisfaction, and
<PB N="98" REF="54">may we ever do &s;o) in the Communion of the be&s;t of <HI>Churches.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have &s;een at length that the <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Super&s;titions</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> wherein they differ from Us, are <HI>Fundamental Points</HI> both of Faith and Wor&s;hip: Therefore have no communi|cation with tho&s;e of that Way, unle&s;s it be where civil <HI>Relations,</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> of <HI>Humanity</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> require your compliance.</P>
<P>Now, to conclude this Point, all the Members of the Church of <HI>England</HI> are called <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> a Name common to Us with our <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>Reformed Churches</HI> beyond Sea, and &s;o indeed we are: <Q REND="inline">For we do &s;olemnly prote&s;t again&s;t the Popi&s;h Univer&s;al Hierarchy, Infalli|ble Judgment, Di&s;pen&s;ations with the Laws of God and Sins of Men, Oral Traditions and other Sacriledges, di&s;po|&s;ing of Kingdoms, depo&s;ing and Mur|dering of Princes, the Merit of Good Works in our Conver&s;ion, the Prie&s;ts pretended Power of tran&s;ub&s;tantiating Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of Chri&s;t, the Sacrifice of the

<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal other <HI>Religious Sects</HI> (or rather Hereticks,) which do err from the <HI>Foundation</HI> and the true <HI>Faith:</HI> Such are the <HI>Anti-Trinitarians, Arians, Socinians,</HI> &amp;c. who deny the
<PB N="100" REF="55"><HI>Doctrin</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity,</HI> the <HI>Divini|ty of Chri&s;t and the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and our <HI>Saviours Satisfaction:</HI> All which being excommunicated by Us, you mu&s;t avoid them as the Pe&s;ts, and Enemies of our <HI>Religion,</HI> and have no Intercour&s;e nor Communion with them.</P>
<P>There's another &s;illy <HI>Sect</HI> called <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> a People &s;o far fallen from <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity,</HI> that they do &s;carce retain any one <HI>Article</HI> of the true <HI>Faith,</HI> &s;light and re|ject all the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel;</HI> and extol the <HI>Light within them</HI> above the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as the only &s;ufficient <HI>Rule</HI> they are obliged to walk by. I on|ly tell you in &s;hort, what <HI>Quakeri&s;m</HI> is, and &s;hall need to &s;ay no more of it, be|ing there's &s;o little <HI>Temptation</HI> to that <HI>Opinion.</HI> Thus much by way of Digre&s;&s;i|on.

<P>Thirdly, To con&s;ider tho&s;e <HI>Preten&s;i|ons, Rea&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> which our <HI>Brethren</HI> of the <HI>Non-conformity</HI> have urg|ed in defence of their Separation from Us. But to do them all the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> ima|ginable, I mu&s;t note to you in the fir&s;t place, That tho&s;e called <HI>Antinomians,
<PB N="101" REF="55">Anabapti&s;ts, Independants,</HI> and <HI>Presby|terians,</HI> do hold the Foundation, tho they differ from Us in &s;ome Opinions not e&s;&s;ential to Salvation; and notwith|&s;tanding their uncharitablene&s;s to Us, we account them <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and <HI>Bre|thren,</HI> as holding the <HI>E&s;&s;entials</HI> of <HI>Chri|&s;tianity,</HI> tho they build upon a weak Foundation.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing <HI>Providence</HI> has led you into tho&s;e Countries for the pre&s;ent, where you cannot wor&s;hip God accord|ing to your own Way; the <HI>Church of England,</HI> both in her <HI>Judgment</HI> and <HI>Prac|tice,</HI> allows you to communicate with tho&s;e Si&s;ter-Churches of the <HI>Reformati|on,</HI> to whom we have always given the right Hand of Fellow&s;hip, tho there be &s;ome circum&s;tantial Differences be|tween Them and Us.

<P>You'l probably meet with &s;ome in your <HI>Travels,</HI> as well as in our own <HI>Na|tion,</HI> who will be very forward to find Faults with and cen&s;ure our <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> (as we have many of that ca|pricious Humour among&s;t Us, tho they &s;carce under&s;tand it.

<P N="1">1.

<P N="4">4. Tho all Per&s;ons in this Nation are obliged to hold <HI>Communion</HI> with the <HI>Church of England,</HI> (&s;eeing tho&s;e pretend|ed Defects in her are only modal and cir|cum&s;tantial, which no <HI>Church</HI> in the <HI>World</HI> can be free from in this State of Tryal and Probation,) yet we are &s;orbidden to communicate with any <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>Sin:</HI> And this is the true rea&s;on and ground of for&s;aking the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> becau&s;e her <HI>Errors</HI> are <HI>Fundamental,</HI> (as we have &s;een already,) and the Conditions of <HI>Communi|on</HI> with her &s;uch, as we cannot comply with, unle&s;s we offer Violence to our own <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> And we do always &s;olemnly declare, that if their New <HI>Arti|cles</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and unchri&s;tian <HI>Practices</HI> did not hinder Us, we &s;hould mo&s;t freely

<P>And again, we have &s;o much Love and Charity for our <HI>modern Di&s;&s;enters</HI> in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that if any one has a truly tender Con&s;cience, &s;o as after a diligent and faithful u&s;e of all convenient and nece&s;&s;a|ry <HI>Means</HI> and <HI>Methods</HI> for his Conviction, (as earne&s;t Prayer to God, reading of good Books, con&s;ultation with his Pari&s;h-Mini&s;ter, or &s;ome other Pious and Learn|ed Divine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> he &s;till remains &s;crupulous and un&s;atisfied; yet rather than &s;in again&s;t his own Con|&s;cience, we do not blame, but pity him, if he mode&s;tly withdraws from our Com|munion. But I am afraid there are &s;ome who have not practi&s;ed the&s;e Methods, altho I have the Charity to believe that very many have; and that mo&s;t of tho&s;e who have &s;eparated from our <HI>Communion,</HI> have not done it through a wilful Ob&s;ti|nacy, but meerly upon the account of Con&s;cience.</P>

<P>Be&s;ides, 'tis ob&s;ervable that the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> treat chiefly of the <HI>E&s;&s;entials</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip,</HI> and only mention the <HI>Governours</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> with &s;ome general Rules (as before) for the ordering of its <HI>Politie</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline:</HI> In&s;omuch, that <HI>many Per&s;ons of great Lear|ning and Judgment</HI> are of opinion, that there's no one <HI>Set-Form of Government</HI> for the <HI>Chri&s;tian Church</HI> to be found in the whole <HI>Bible,</HI> but mu&s;t be left to our Go|vernours to order and appoint according to the Rules and Dictates of &s;ound Judg|ment
<PB N="119" REF="64">and Di&s;cretion: Which the Learn|ed and Judicious <HI>Hooker</HI> gives a mo&s;t ad|mirable Account of in his <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;t. Polit.</HI></P>
<P>Nor can this in the lea&s;t impeach (as &s;ome have vainly objected the Sufficien|cy of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> or the Fidelity of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in not leaving a perfect <HI>Model</HI> of <HI>Church Government</HI> behind him: For we have &s;een already, that the <HI>Holy Scrip|tures</HI> were primarily intended to in&s;truct us in the <HI>Fundamentals</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Chri|&s;tian Morality,</HI> and &s;peak only overtly of <HI>Church Di&s;cipline</HI> and <HI>Government.</HI> And, for the Fidelity of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> herein, 'tis plain that the Church in our Saviours Time was in her <HI>Minority,</HI> which mu&s;t after|wards (by degrees) grow up to a &s;tate of greater <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Perfection.</HI> What o|thers have urged from the Form of <HI>Church Government</HI> under the <HI>Jewi&s;h Oeconomie</HI> concludes nothing: For the <HI>Jews</HI> lived all under one <HI>Politie</HI> and in one <HI>Nation;</HI> whereas <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> is di&s;per&s;ed all over the World, under many di&s;&s;erent <HI>Civil Go|vernments;</HI> and therefore the <HI>Circum&s;tan|ces</HI> of Religious <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Church Di&s;ci|pline,</HI> mu&s;t be &s;uited to the State and Con|dition of different People within their &s;e|veral
<PB N="120" REF="65">Juri&s;dictions, as may appear mo&s;t ju&s;t and rea&s;onable to the Judgments and Di&s;cretion of their lawful Governours. Therefore,</P>

For tho our <HI>Liturgy</HI> and <HI>Set-Forms</HI> of <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> have been extream|ly cavil'd at by &s;ome of our Adver&s;aries, yet 'tis evident that neither the <HI>Prophets</HI> of old, nor our <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> nor the <HI>Primitive Fathers,</HI> did ever find fault with the Stated Methods and Forms of Prayer, but did practi&s;e and appoint 'em them&s;elves, and highly encourag'd them in others. For there are many <HI>Set-Forms</HI> of <HI>Prayer, Benedictions</HI> and <HI>Thank&s;givings,</HI> in the Writings of the <HI>Prophets;</HI> our Savi|our compo&s;ed a <HI>Form of Prayer</HI> to be u&s;ed by his <HI>Apo&s;tles</HI> and <HI>Followers,</HI> (tho they were doubtle&s;s as able to pray by the Spi|rit as the mo&s;t Seraphick <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t,</HI>) which <HI>Method</HI> al&s;o was ob&s;erved by <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t,</HI> for the direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his <HI>Di&s;ciples</HI> in God's <HI>Wor&s;hip.</HI> All
<PB N="121" REF="65">which <HI>Stated Forms</HI> became Patterns and Pre&s;idents to the Churches of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in af|ter Ages, who had all their &s;everal <HI>Litur|gies</HI> as we have; nor is there any thing in our <HI>Service Book</HI> which is contrary to, but mo&s;t exactly conformable to tho&s;e <HI>Rules.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let not the bare Pretence then of &s;ome &s;mall Errors in and about the Cir|cum&s;tances of <HI>Publick Wor&s;hip,</HI> prevail with any Man to &s;eparate from the Com|munion of his <HI>National Church,</HI> &s;eeing there have been, and are as many, and pro|bably greater Errors in all the Churches of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in all Ages of the Go&s;pel: For tho our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour promis'd, <HI>that the Gates of Hell &s;hould not prevail again&s;t the &V;niver&s;al Church, that he will be with her to the end of the World, &s;end his Spirit to lead her into all Truth, and abide with her for ever;</HI> yet the&s;e <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> do only re&s;pect the Fundamental Doctrins of the Catholic and Univer&s;al Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> or a People profe&s;&s;ing the Truth, how|ever they may err (as all of them do) in Opinions not e&s;&s;ential to <HI>Religion.</HI> And &s;eeing every particular Church may be guilty of &s;ome Errors and Mi&s;takes in out|ward Circum&s;tances of Religion, there|fore
<PB N="122" REF="66">fore he that will &s;eparate upon this Ac|count can &s;carce hold Communion with any National Church upon Earth. And tho&s;e fickle and fanciful Per&s;ons might have had the &s;ame <HI>Plea,</HI> to have &s;eparated from the Chri&s;tian Church in the time of the Apo&s;tles that they have now from Us: Nor is there any one that under|&s;tands the State of our Church, but will readily acknowledge, that our Orders of <HI>Bi&s;hops Prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> and <HI>Set Form</HI> of <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Di&s;cipline,</HI> are if not of A|po&s;tolical,) yet of Primitive In&s;titution.</P>
<P N="5">5. No meer Inconveniences, or circum|&s;tantial Errors or Defects and tho&s;e only alledged, not proved again&s;t Us, can ju&s;ti|fie or excu&s;e a <HI>Departure</HI> from Us, &s;ince I have made it fully evident that our Church holds and maintains all the <HI>E&s;&s;en|tials</HI> both of <HI>Faith</HI> and of <HI>Wor&s;hip.</HI> For, we have &s;een already, that all Men are oblig'd to conform them&s;elves to the Con&s;titutions of their National Church, tho &s;ome of the external Modes &amp; Forms be inconvenient, di&s;orderly and defective, rather than not be of any Church at all: And what they cannot reform without di&s;turbing the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI>) 'tis
<PB N="123" REF="66" MS="y">their Duty to tolerate, &s;eeing there's no Na|tional and Particular Church in the World, (as we have already ob&s;erved) who&s;e Con|&s;titutions and Government are ab&s;olutely perfect. Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6. Tho&s;e Per&s;ons are extreamly to blame that require greater <HI>Purity</HI> in Gods <HI>Public Wor|&s;hip,</HI> than the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> have command|ed, or our Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> or the Primitive Orthodox <HI>Fathers</HI> have re|commended to Po&s;terity. And tho there were &s;ome things ami&s;s in the outward <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI> and <HI>Government:</HI> Yet 'tis not the Province, nor in the power of private Men to reform <HI>Religion;</HI> this being wholly le&s;t to the prudent management of tho&s;e <HI>Go|vernours,</HI> whom the divine Providence has con&s;tituted and appointed to rule over Us. Wherefore that precipitant and ra&s;h <HI>Zeal</HI> (which &s;ome mi&s;call <HI>Puty</HI>) will more di&s;turb the Peace of their own Con&s;ciences, and pre|judice the Intere&s;t of the Church, than their charitable and peaceable Compliance with tho&s;e &s;eeming Error, and Defects, which they &s;o much cavil at and complain of.</P>
<P N="7">7. 'Tis the greate&s;t Argument then of Im|prudence and Indi&s;cretion, to run upon ma|nife&s;t and real Evils, upon tho&s;e Fears and Jealou&s;ies (which are meerly groundle&s;s) and only imagin'd to be &s;o. Will any Man of <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Religion</HI> dare to for&s;ake Gods pub|lick Ordinances, and make a <HI>Schi&s;m</HI> in the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e perhaps there may
<PB N="124" REF="67">be &s;ome probable <HI>Defects</HI> in her <HI>Communion.</HI> For Gods Commands to attend his Publick Wor&s;hip, and endeavour the Peace of the Church, are plain and po&s;itive, whereas the <HI>Errors</HI> objected again&s;t us are dubious and di&s;|putable: And now, to ca&s;t the <HI>Scales,</HI> the far greater number of pious, learned &amp; judicious <HI>Men</HI> are on our <HI>&s;ide;</HI> &s;o, that for any thing they know, they may be mi&s;taken. But granting 'em that we do err, let our <HI>Governours</HI> &s;ee to it, we have a &s;ufficient Rule for our Obedi|ence, (nor dare we &s;ub&s;tract it for the &s;ake of an Inconvenience only, if their <HI>Commands</HI> be not &s;inful) but they have none for their Di&s;obedience. And therefore &s;eeing they have no lawful Authority to reform the lea&s;t Er|ror or Mi&s;take in Government, it would be the greater Prudence, and more Chri&s;tian like to pray &amp; mourn in &s;ecret for what they ap|prehend ami&s;s, than to di&s;obey and exa&s;pe|rate their Governours, &s;tir up Divi&s;ions in the Church, &amp; run upon the dangerous <HI>Hazzards</HI> of a licentious and unwarrantable <HI>Separation.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. We &s;hould be always more concern'd for promoting the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> and our own <HI>National Church,</HI> than the gratifying of our own per&s;onal and private <HI>Fancies</HI> and <HI>Opinions.</HI> For it has been a great fault in mo&s;t of our Brethren of the Non-conformity, who have been &s;o wedded to their own pri|vate Humours and Conceits, that they have almo&s;t quite forgot the <HI>Peace of the Church,</HI> and the true <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Reform'd

Whereas, if they had the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of their Duty and Intere&s;t, they would keep clo&s;e (at this Time e&s;pecially) to our <HI>Communion;</HI> which under God would be their chief Refuge, and yield in &s;ome &s;mall Mat|ters, tho le&s;s agreeable to their own private Sentiments and Opinions, for the greater Benefit of the Publick.</P>
<P N="9">9. No <HI>Prejudice</HI> &s;hould prevail with any Man &s;o far, as to make him unwilling to re|cant and di&s;claim his <HI>Errors</HI> upon a through Conviction, and return to the ways of Truth and Peace, from which he has formerly er|red. And therefore 'tis a great Fault in many who are unwilling to retract tho&s;e Errors which they have e&s;pou&s;ed, le&s;t they &s;hould be cen&s;ured by their <HI>Party</HI> as <HI>Renegadoes</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tates</HI> from their <HI>Religion:</HI> Whereas, if they would but &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider it, 'twill be their greate&s;t Honour as well as Intere&s;t, and a &s;pecial Evidence of their Integrity, to acknowledg &amp; recant their <HI>Errors</HI> &amp; <HI>Mi&s;takes;</HI> nor need any Man be a&s;ham'd or afraid to confe&s;s he has erred.

<PB N="126" REF="68">Works: Nor can any Man come under the vile imputation and &s;candal of an <HI>Apo|&s;tate,</HI> who changes only &s;ome mi&s;taken Er|rors and Opinions, not his <HI>Religion.</HI> And</P>
<P>La&s;tly, Others have been extreamly to blame in &s;etting up their own private Glo&s;|&s;es and Interpretations of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as infallible <HI>Maxims</HI> and nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Conclu&s;ions,</HI> in&s;omuch that they I rather di&s;turb the <HI>Peace</HI> of the <HI>Community,</HI> than be per&s;uaded to recede from them: For being ignorant of the &s;cope and meaning of tho&s;e &s;acred and lively <HI>Ora|cles,</HI> they pre&s;ently &s;ancy without the lea&s;t true ground, that every <HI>Pa&s;&s;age</HI> founding that Way, mu&s;t be a &s;trong and forcible <HI>Argument</HI> to prove and confirm their <HI>Opinion.</HI> The <HI>Scrip|tures</HI> indeed be allowed, and are of important and nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e for the Conduct of their <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI> in the ways of <HI>Religion:</HI> But then &s;hall every <HI>Mechanick</HI> pre&s;ume to be an Interpreter and Judge (and think him&s;elf as infallible as the Pope in <HI>Cathedra</HI>) of all the ab&s;tru&s;e and difficult <HI>Pa&s;&s;ages</HI> in <HI>Holy Writ?</HI></P>
<P>Now, what can it be but meer <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> and <HI>Delu&s;ion</HI> in any one to pretend to inter|pret the dark Points of Scripture, (which nei|ther concern Mens Faith nor Manners) with|out the u&s;e of tho&s;e <HI>Means</HI> which are out of the reach of the <HI>Vulgar?</HI> They'l readily grant, that in all other <HI>Profe&s;&s;ions, Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> a Man mu&s;t be a con&s;iderable time, and take great pains to gain <HI>Experience</HI> ere he can be ca|pable of managing, and mu&s;t be an approved
