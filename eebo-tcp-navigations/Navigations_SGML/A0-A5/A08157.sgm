<HEAD>AN ABSTRACT OVT OF LETTERS WRITTEN FROM ELSAS AND STRABVRGH, bearing date of the 22. of May. 1622.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Towne of Hagenaw being &s;trongly be&s;iege by the Arch Duke <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> and vpon the 16. of May, all the &s;conces about it taken by him, but yet with great lo&s;&s;e of many of his men, pre&s;ently there|upon he &s;ent certaine me&s;&s;engers to Strasburgh, who for the taking in of the Towne made &s;ute vnto them to &s;end him &s;ome proui&s;ion for the &s;ame, hoping vpon the 17. of May, to take it; and for that it is the Imperi|all chamber, the &s;ayd Arch Duke doubted not, but that the Coun&s;ell of the Citie of Strasburgh, would not &s;pare to &s;tretch out their meanes to helpe him, where vpon the &s;ayd Coun&s;ell taking no &s;peedy re&s;olution, but rather for a while con&s;ulted what they &s;hould doe, &s;ent &s;ome powder, bullets, and prouant vnto him. But not long after, newes was brought that <HI>Fredericke</HI> King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the Earle of Mansfield with their Ar|mie were not farre from Hagenaw, and that 1000. cra|baten mo&s;t cuira&s;&s;ers, that were &s;ent by the Arch Duke to &s;top Mansfields pa&s;&s;age, were &s;et vpon and fought with all by <HI>Colonell Ouertront,</HI> in which fight 500. of them were &s;laine, many taken pri&s;oners, and the re&s;t &s;cattered and di&s;per&s;ed abroad. And vpon the 17. day of May in the euening, &s;ome of them that fled, got to <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Campe, and certified him thereof, coun&s;el|ling him to make preparation to fly away, whereupon
<PB N="2" REF="3">he pre&s;ently &s;et fire on his Tents, and &s;o went away, leauing the Towne at libertie againe. But the Earle of Mansfield, with all &s;peede and diligence with 10000. men, followed him, and as many of his &s;ouldiers as he could get, he &s;lew, and di&s;per&s;ing <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Armie tooke from him great &s;tore of powder, bullets, pillage: and &s;ome prouant.</P>
<P>And vpon the 18. and 19. of May the &s;ayd Earle of Mansfield pur&s;uing the cha&s;e, marched further towards Tru&s;enheim, where <HI>Leopoldus</HI> &s;ouldiers had ca&s;t vp a &s;con&s;e vpon the Rhin, and had fortified the &s;ame, wher|in many of the &s;ayd &s;ouldiers had &s;aued them&s;elues, to the number of 2000. men, and had prepared boates ready, if they were a&s;&s;ailed, to &s;et them ouer the Rhin, but Mansfield enclo&s;ed them round about, and cut|ting of the boates, and carrying them away, gaue them an alarme, and entring in vpon them, &s;lew them all, and therein found great &s;tore of bootie, of the which euery &s;ouldier was &s;uffered to take what&s;oeuer he could for him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>After that vpon the 20. of May many of Mansfields &s;ouldiers marched along by Strasburgh, to ouerrun all the Countrie of El&s;as, and all tho&s;e places that <HI>Leopol|dus</HI> had taken in, which put <HI>Leopoldus</HI> &s;ouldiers in &s;uch a feare that they knew not where to &s;tay, nor to hide them&s;elues, and if it had not beene for a bridge that was broken downe, whereby <HI>Colonell Ouertr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nt</HI> came halfe an houre to late, he had taken <HI>Leopoldus</HI> him&s;elfe, the King of Bohemia went per&s;onally to goe into Strasburgh, from whence <HI>Leopoldus</HI> me&s;&s;engers much grieued, road ha&s;tily away, and what &s;oeuer they had obtained of the Towne, Mansfield had the mo&s;t part thereof.</P>
<P>Touching the Marquis of <HI>Doerlach</HI> his ouerthrow
<PB REF="3">was not &s;o great, as it was thought to haue beene, who with the fir&s;t is to enter into the field againe with ten thou&s;and men. It is &s;ayd, that the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> wrote vnto him, to make good his lo&s;&s;es, and to giue him all againe that was taken from him, if hee would leaue the field, and di&s;charge his &s;ouldiers; but hee roundly and roughly refu&s;ed to doe &s;o, and for an&s;wer &s;ent him word, that he hoped by Armes to recouer his lo&s;&s;es againe.</P>
<P>Letters of the 21. al&s;o certifie, That after <HI>Leopoldus</HI> Colonels and Souldiers vnder&s;tood, that <HI>Mansfields</HI> Armie &s;till marched vpward, and behaued them&s;elues &s;o valiantly, and with &s;uch courage again&s;t them, they would not &s;tay for him, but retired in flight to <HI>El&s;as, Sabren, Moltheim</HI> and <HI>Dack&s;teim;</HI> but their carriage, waggons and women, were all left behinde them, which <HI>Mansfield</HI> &s;et vpon, and ran&s;acking them, tooke many chaines of gold and jewells from them, but did no hurt to the women, but tooke their quarter from them, and there &s;tayed.</P>
<P>Other Letters of the 22. certifie, That the &s;ame day &s;ix cornets of <HI>Leopoldus</HI> hor&s;emen came to <HI>Mitle|hinsbergen,</HI> that had conuoyed their Colonell <HI>Mor|der,</HI> but as then hee was not per&s;onally with them: men wondered that <HI>Mansfield</HI> had not &s;et on them, they &s;aid, that in the &s;pace of three dayes, they had neyther eaten nor &s;eene any bread, and that they had &s;aued them&s;elues heere and there in the woods, and for a time got fother from the &s;aid Towne, and after that went to <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> being not farre from thence, where &s;taying about the length of a great peece of Or|dinance &s;hot, without the Towne, they &s;ent a Trum|pet to offer their &s;eruice vnto them, but the magi&s;trates thanked them, and made them an&s;were, that they had
<PB N="4" REF="4">no need of hor&s;emen, whereupon they intreated the Magi&s;trates, that they might be permitted (if any of <HI>Mansfields</HI> colonells were in the Towne) to offer their &s;eruice vnto them, and &s;o to yeelde them&s;elues vnto him, which they graunted. But Colonell <HI>Ouertront</HI> with his brother and cou&s;en that then were there, hea|ring thereof, rode pre&s;ently vnto them, with cer|taine hor&s;emen, and entertaining them with a friend|ly countenance, asked them why they would no more &s;erue their Lord, they tolde him, that they had not receiued any money in twelue or eighteene moneths, as al&s;o, that their Colonell had left them, and that therefore they were di&s;charged of their oathes, and prayed that they might bee entertained in <HI>Mansfields</HI> Army. The Duke of <HI>Saxon</HI> in the meane time came to di&s;&s;wade tho&s;e hor&s;e, when they were on the poynt of changing their Spani&s;h Co&s;aques, &amp; &s;o was taken pri|&s;oner: he is of the hou&s;e of <HI>Saxen, Lawenberg,</HI> his grand|father was he that was depriued of the Electorate; hee pretends him&s;elfe to be no lawfull pri&s;oner, hauing quitted a Regiment hee had in <HI>Hungarie,</HI> about &s;euen moneths &s;ince, that hee was at <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> in expec|tation of being receiued into the French Kings &s;eruice. That hee came out of the Port of <HI>Strasburgh</HI> to &s;peake with a Captaine of his brothers Regiment, to re&s;erue him&s;elfe for <HI>Fraunce</HI> if the Regiment disbanded. His Brother is in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> where hee hath two other Re|giments, one of hor&s;e and another of foote. But <HI>O|uertrant</HI> alleadgeth that he is in <HI>Leopoldus</HI> &s;eruice, and came out to di&s;&s;wade the Regiment from disbanding, and that hee clapt betweene him and the Port. The Duke &s;aith within the Centrie, but without the Turne pike. What King <HI>Fredericke</HI> will doe with him, wee &s;hall hereafter heare.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>The &s;aid 6 Coronets of hor&s;men &s;aid, that the next day, 5 Coronets of <HI>Crati&s;che</HI> hor&s;e|men, and a regiment of footemen more would al&s;o yeeld vnto <HI>Mansfield,</HI> and enter into pay with him. It is thought the whole army will ri&s;e and march towards <HI>El&s;us Sa|beren, Molti&s;heim, Dac&s;tein</HI> and other places, for that the &s;aid townes haue want of Mu|nition and prouant, becau&s;e they were for|ced to &s;end it all to the campe before <HI>Hage|naw:</HI> it is dangerous trauelling in the&s;e parts round about: and it is to be feared that all <HI>Fl&s;as</HI> will yeeld, or forcibly be brought vn|der King <HI>Fredericks</HI> command. The Arch|duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> &s;aued him&s;elfe in <HI>Freiburge.</HI></P>
<P>Further, letters of the 22 of May certifie, that thereabouts they haue &s;trengthened them&s;elues with a few footmen that fled a|way from <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> with 5 field peeces, and in great danger; for the Marquis of <HI>Durlach</HI> who with 7000 foote and 2000 hor&s;emen is entred againe into the field, and hauing di&s;charged and paid all his men, hath again entertained them in King <HI>Fredericks</HI> name.</P>
<P>The relieuing and beating away of the army before <HI>Hagenaw,</HI> is confirmed by o|ther
<PB REF="5">letters: they vvithin the towne could not haue holden out aboue 2 dayes longer: the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> in his retraite lo&s;t a great peece of ordinance, 26 hundred weight of pou|der, great &s;tore of munition, bullets &amp; match, as al&s;o all his cariage, and 500 men that vvere &s;laine, the re&s;t that &s;aued them&s;elues in the flight, went to <HI>Litchtnaw,</HI> and further vpvvard to <HI>Wil&s;teden,</HI> &amp; are gone ouer the Rhine, &amp; in the ditches about the &s;uburbes, vvhile the gari|&s;on in <HI>Hagenaw</HI> valiantly defended them&s;elues: many of <HI>Leopoldus</HI> &s;ouldiers vvere &s;taine in the approch. And newes is now come that <HI>Wa&s;e|naw,</HI> Colonell <HI>Crats,</HI> vvith 6 cornets of hor&s;e|men &amp; 2 regiments of footmen, haue left <HI>Leo|poldus,</HI> &amp; are falne to <HI>Mansfields</HI> &s;ide, and that foure cornets of hor&s;emen more &amp; a regiment of footmen vvould doe the like.</P>
