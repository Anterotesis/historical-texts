<HEAD>A NEW HISTORICAL RELATION OF THE KINGDOM OF SIAM. The Occa&s;ion and De&s;ign of this Work.</HEAD>
<P>AT my return from the Voyage I made to <HI>Siam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occa&s;ion of this work.</NOTE> in quality of his Most Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ties Envoy Extraordinary, they who&s;e right it is to command, requir'd me to render them an exact account of the things, which I had &s;een or learnt in that Country; which will be the whole matter of this work. Others have &s;ufficiently informed the Public of the Circum&s;tances of this long Voyage: But as to what concerns the De&s;cription of a Country, we cannot have too many Relations, if we would perfectly know it: the la&s;t always illu&s;trating the former. But that it may be known from what time I write, I &s;hall declare only that we &s;et Sail from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> on the Fir&s;t of <HI>March, Anno 1687.</HI> That we ca&s;t An|chor in the Road of <HI>Siam</HI> the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> in the &s;ame Year. That we departed thence for our return the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>January, 1688.</HI> And that we landed at <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> the <HI>27th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> following.</P>
<P>My De&s;ign is therefore to treat fir&s;t of the Country of <HI>Siam,</HI> its Extent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The De&s;ign of this work.</NOTE>
Fertility, and the qualities of its Soil and Climate: Secondly, I will ex|plain the manners of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> in general, and then their particular Cu&s;toms according to their various Qualities. Their Government and Reli|gion &s;hall be comprehended in the la&s;t part; and I flatter my &s;elf that the farther the Reader &s;hall advance in the peru&s;al of this work, the more he will find it worthy of Curio&s;ity; by rea&s;on that the Nature and Genius of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> which I have every where endeavoured to penetrate into, will be di&s;covered more and more: In fine, not to &s;tay on things, which would not plea&s;e every one, or which would interrupt my Narrative too much, I will at the end in&s;ert &s;everal Memoirs which I brought from this Country,
<PB N="2" REF="4">
and which I cannot &s;uppre&s;s without injuring the Curio&s;ity of the Public. But if notwith&s;tanding this precaution, I do yet enlarge on certain matters beyond the reli&s;h of &s;ome, I intreat them to con&s;ider that general expre&s;&s;i|ons do never afford just Idea's; and that this is to proceed no farther than the &s;uperficial Knowledge of things. 'Tis out of this de&s;ire of making the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> perfectly known, that I give &s;everal notices of the other Kingdoms of the <HI>Indies</HI> and of <HI>China:</HI> For though rigorou&s;ly taken, all this may appear foreign to my Subject, yet to me it &s;eems that the Compari&s;on of the things of Neighbouring Countries with each other, does greatly illu&s;trate them. I hope al&s;o that a pardon will be granted me for the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> names, which I relate and explain. The&s;e remarks will make other relations intelligible as well as mine, which without the&s;e Illu&s;trations might &s;ometimes cau&s;e a doubt concerning what I a&s;&s;ert.</P>
<P>In a word, tho&s;e with whom I am acquainted do know that I love the Truth; but it is not &s;ufficient to give a &s;incere relation to make it appear true: 'Tis requi&s;ite to add clearne&s;s to &s;incerity, and to be thoroughly in|form'd of that wherein we undertake to instruct others. I have therefore con|&s;idered, interrogated, and penetrated, as far as it was po&s;&s;ible; and to render my &s;elf more capable of doing it, I carefully read over, before my arrival at <HI>Siam,</HI> &s;everal Antient and Modern Relations of divers Countreys of the East. So that in my opinion this preparation has &s;upplied the defect of a longer re&s;idence, and has made me to remark and under&s;tand in the three Months I was at <HI>Siam,</HI> what I could not perhaps have under&s;tood or remark'd in three Years, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and peru&s;al of tho&s;e Di&s;|cour&s;es.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Geographical De&s;cription.</HEAD>
<P>NAvigation has &s;ufficiently made known the Sea Coa&s;ts of the King|dom of <HI>Siam,</HI> and many Authors have de&s;cribed them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">How much this Kingdom is unknown.</NOTE> but they know almo&s;t nothing of the Inland Country, becau&s;e the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have not made a Map of their Country, or at lea&s;t know how to keep it &s;ecret. That which I here pre&s;ent is the work of an <HI>European,</HI> who went up the <HI>Menam,</HI> the principal River of the Country, to the Frontiers of the King|dom; but was not skilful enough to give all the Po&s;itions with an entire exact|ne&s;s. Be&s;ides he has not &s;een all; and therefore I thought it nece&s;&s;ary to give his Map to Mr. <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini,</HI> Director of the Ob&s;ervatory at <HI>Paris,</HI> to correct it by &s;ome Memorials which were given me at <HI>Siam.</HI> Neverthele&s;s I know it to be &s;till defective; but yet it fails not to give &s;ome notices of this Kingdom which were never heard of, and of being more exact in tho&s;e we already have:</P>
<P>Its Frontiers extend Northward to the 22^d. Degree, or thereabouts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Frontiers Northward.</NOTE> and the Road which terminates the Gulph of <HI>Siam,</HI> being almo&s;t at the Latitude of 13 degrees and a half, it follows, that this whole extent, of which we hardly have any knowledge, runs about 170 Leagues in a direct Line, reckoning 20 Leagues to a degree of Latitude, after the manner of our Seamen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do &s;ay that the City of <HI>Chiamai</HI> is fifteen days journey more to the North, than the Frontiers of their Kingdom, that is to &s;ay at mo&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Chiamai</HI> and its Lake.</NOTE> be|tween &s;ixty and &s;eventy Leagues; for they are Journeys by water, and again&s;t the Stream. 'Tis about thirty years &s;ince their King, as they report, took this City, and abandon'd it, after having carried away all the People; and it has been &s;ince repeopled by the King of <HI>Ava,</HI> to whom <HI>Pegu</HI> does at pre&s;ent render Obedience. But the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> which were at that expedition, do not know that famous Lake, from whence our Geographers make the River <HI>Menam</HI> ari&s;e, and to which, according to them, this City gives its Names: which makes me to think either that it is more di&s;tant than our Geographers have conceived, or that there is no &s;uch Lake. It may al&s;o happen that this City adjoyning to &s;e|veral Kingdoms, and being more &s;ubject than another to be ruined by War, has not always been rebuilt in the &s;ame place: And this is not difficult to imagine of the Cities which are built only with wood, as all in the&s;e Countreys are, and which in their de&s;truction leave not any Ruines nor Foundations. How|ever it may be doubted, whether the <HI>Menam</HI> &s;prings from a Lake, by rea&s;on it is &s;o &s;mall at its entrance into the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> that for about fifty Leagues, it carries only little Boats capable of holding no more than four or five Per&s;ons at mo&s;t.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> is bounded from the Ea&s;t to the North by high Moun|tains, which &s;eparate it from the Kingdom of <HI>Laos,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Country of <HI>Siam</HI> is only a Valley.</NOTE> and on the North and We&s;t by others, which divide it from the Kingdoms of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Ava.</HI> This double Chain of Mountains (inhabited by a few, &s;avage, and poor, but yet free Peo|ple, who&s;e Life is innocent) leaves between them a great Valley, containing in &s;ome places between four&s;core and an hundred Leagues in bredth, and is wa|tered
<PB N="4" REF="6">
from the City of <HI>Chiamai</HI> to the Sea, that is to &s;ay from the North to the South, with an excellent River which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> call <HI>Me-nam,</HI> or <HI>Mother-water,</HI> to &s;ignifie, <HI>a great water,</HI> which being encrea&s;ed by the Brooks and Rivers it re|ceives on every &s;ide, from the Mountains I have mentioned, di&s;charges it &s;elf at la&s;t into the Gulph of <HI>Siam</HI> by three months, the mo&s;t navigable of which is that toward the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities &s;eated on the River.</NOTE>On this River, and about &s;even Miles from the Sea, is &s;eated the City of <HI>Bancok:</HI> and I &s;hall tran&s;iently declare, that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have very few habita|tions on their Coa&s;ts, which are not far di&s;tant from thence; but are almo&s;t all &s;eated on Rivers navigable enough to afford them the Commerce of the Sea. As to the names of mo&s;t of the&s;e places, which for this rea&s;on may be called Ma|ritime, they are di&s;gui&s;ed by Foreigners. Thus the City of <HI>Bancok</HI> is called <HI>Fon</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> it not being known from whence the name of <HI>Bancok</HI> is derived, altho there be &s;everal <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Names, that begin with the word <HI>Ban,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Village.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gardens of <HI>Bancok.</HI></NOTE>The Gardens which are in the Territory of <HI>Bancok,</HI> for the &s;pace of four Leagues, in a&s;cending towards the City of <HI>Siam</HI> to a place named <HI>Talacoan,</HI> do &s;upply this City with the Nouri&s;hment which the Natives of the Country love be&s;t, I mean a great quantity of Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Cities on the <HI>Menam.</HI></NOTE>The other principal places which the <HI>Menam</HI> waters, are, <HI>Me-Tac</HI> the fir&s;t City of the Kingdom to the North North-We&s;t, and then &s;ucce&s;&s;ively <HI>Tian-Tong, Campeng pet</HI> or <HI>Campeng</HI> &s;imple, which &s;ome do pronounce <HI>Campingue, Laconcevan, Tchainat, Siam, Talacoan, Talaqueou,</HI> and <HI>Bancok.</HI> Between the two Cities of <HI>Tchainat</HI> and <HI>Siam,</HI> and at a di&s;tance, which the Maeanders of the River do render almo&s;t equal from each other, the River leaves the City of <HI>Louvo</HI> a little to the Ea&s;t, at the 14 d. 42 m. 32 S. of Latitude, according to the ob&s;ervations which the Je&s;uites have publi&s;hed. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> does there &s;pend the greate&s;t part of the year, the more commodiou&s;ly to enjoy the diver|&s;ion of Hunting: but <HI>Louvo</HI> would not be habitable, were it not for a channel cut from the River to water it. The City of <HI>Me-Tac</HI> renders obedience to an Hereditary Lord, who, they &s;ay, is a Va&s;&s;al to the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> whom &s;ome call <HI>Paya-Tac,</HI> or Prince of <HI>Tac. Tian-Tong</HI> is ruin'd, doubtle&s;s by the Ancient Wars of <HI>Pegu. Campeng</HI> is known by the Mines of excellent Steel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another River likewi&s;e called <HI>Menam.</HI></NOTE>At the City of <HI>Laconcevan</HI> the <HI>Menam</HI> receives another con&s;iderable River which comes al&s;o from the North, and is likewi&s;e called <HI>Menam,</HI> a name common to all great Rivers. Our Geographers make it to &s;pring from the Lake of <HI>Chia|mai:</HI> but it is certain that it hath its &s;ource in the Mountains, which lye not &s;o much to the North as this City. It runs fir&s;t to <HI>Meuang-fang,</HI> then to <HI>Pitchiai, Pit&s;anoulouc,</HI> and <HI>Pitchit,</HI> and at la&s;t to <HI>Laconcevan,</HI> where it mixes, as I have &s;aid with the other River.</P>
<P><HI>Pit&s;anoulouc,</HI> which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> do corruptly call <HI>Por&s;elouc</HI> has formerly had hereditary Lords, like the City of <HI>Me-Tac:</HI> and Ju&s;tice is at pre&s;ent exe|cuted in the Palace of the Ancient Princes. 'Tis a City of great commerce, fortified with fourteen Ba&s;tions, and is at 19 degrees and &s;ome minutes Lati|tude.</P>
<P><HI>Laconcevan</HI> &s;tands about the mid-way from <HI>Pit&s;anoulouc</HI> or <HI>Por&s;elouc</HI> to <HI>Siam,</HI> a di&s;tance computed to be Twenty five days Journey, for tho&s;e that go up the River in a Boat or <HI>Balon;</HI> but this voyage may be performed in twelve days when they have a great many Rowers, and they a&s;cend the River with &s;peed.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities of Wood.</NOTE>The&s;e Cities, like all the re&s;t in the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> are only a great num|ber of Cabbins frequently environ'd with an enclo&s;ure of Wood, and &s;ome|times with a Brick, or Stone Wall, but very rarely of Stone. Neverthele&s;s as the Ea&s;tern people have ever had as much magnificence and pride in the figures of their Language&punc; as &s;implicity and poverty in whatever appertains to Life, the names of the&s;e Cities do &s;ignifie great things; <HI>Tian-Tong,</HI> for in|&s;tance, &s;ignifies <HI>True Gold; Campeng pet, Walls of Diamond;</HI> and 'tis &s;aid that its Walls are of Stone:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;uper&s;ti|tion of the <HI>Si|ame&s;es</HI> at <HI>Meu|ang-fang.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Laconcevan</HI> &s;ignifies the <HI>Mountain of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>But as for what concerns <HI>Meuang fang,</HI> the word <HI>Fang</HI> being the name of a Tree famous for dying, and which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have called <HI>Sapan;</HI> &s;ome in|terpret

<P>Such another Super&s;tition prevails at a place named <HI>Prabat,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Su|per&s;tition at <HI>Prabrat.</HI></NOTE> about five or &s;ix leagues to the Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t of the City of <HI>Louvo;</HI> the &s;uper&s;tition is this; In the <HI>Balie</HI> Language, which is the learned tongue of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> or the Tongue of their Religion, <HI>Bat</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>Foot,</HI> and the word <HI>Pra,</HI> of which it is not po&s;&s;ible exactly to render the &s;ignification, &s;ignifies in the &s;ame tongue whatever may be conceived worthy of veneration and re&s;pect.

<P>The <HI>Prabat</HI> is therefore the print of a mans foot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What it is.</NOTE> cut by an ill Graver upon a Rock; but this impre&s;&s;ion containing about 13 or 14 inches in depth, is five or &s;ix times as long as a man's Foot, and proportionably as broad. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> adore it, and are per&s;waded that the Elephants, e&s;pecially the white ones, the Rhinoceros, and all the other Bea&s;ts of their Woods, do likewi&s;e go to wor|&s;hip it when no per&s;on is there; And the King of <HI>Siam</HI> him&s;elf goes to adore it once a year with a great deal of Pomp and Ceremony. It is covered with a Plate of Gold, and inclo&s;ed in a Chappel which is there built. They report that this Rock which is now very flat and like a new mown Field, was formerly a very high Mountain, which &s;hrunk and waxed level on a &s;udden under the Foot of <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> in memory of whom they believe that the Impre&s;&s;ion of the Foot does there remain. Neverthele&s;s it is certain by the Te&s;timony of ancient men, that the Antiquity of this Tradition exceeds not 90 years. A <HI>Talapoin,</HI> or Religious <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> of that time, having doubtle&s;s made this Impre&s;&s;ion him&s;elf, or procured it to be made, and then feigned to have miraculou&s;ly di&s;covered it; and without any other appearance of Truth, gave Reputation and Credit to this Fable of the levell'd Mountain.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Countrey inter&s;ected with Chan|nels.

<P>'Tis by the means of the&s;e Channels, called by the <HI>Siame&s;es Cloum,</HI> that the City of <HI>Siam</HI> is not only become an I&s;land, but is placed in the middle of &s;eve|ral I&s;lands, which renders the &s;ituation thereof very &s;ingular. The I&s;le wherein it is &s;ituated, is at pre&s;ent all inclo&s;ed within its walls, which certainly was not in the time of <HI>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto;</HI> if notwith&s;tanding the continual mi&s;takes of this Author, who &s;eems to rely too much on his memory, we may believe what he &s;ays, that the Elephants of the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> who then be&s;ieged the City of <HI>Siam,</HI> did &s;o nearly approach the Walls, as with their Trunks to beat down the Pali&s;ado's which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> had there placed to cover them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Its Latitude, according to Father <HI>Thomas</HI> the Je&s;uit, is 14 d. 20 m. 40 S. and its Longitude 120 d. 30 m. It has almo&s;t the figure of a Pur&s;e, the mouth of which is to the Ea&s;t, and the bottom to the We&s;t. The River meets it at the North by &s;everal Channels, which run into that which environs it; and leaves it on the South, by &s;eparating it&s;elf again into &s;everal &s;treams. The King's Palace &s;tands to the North on the Canal which embraces the City; and by turning to the Ea&s;t, there is a Cau&s;ey, by which alone, as by an <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> People may go out of the City without cro&s;&s;ing the water.</P>
<P>The City is &s;pacious, con&s;idering the Circuit of its Walls, which, as I have &s;aid, inclo&s;es the whole I&s;le; but &s;carce the &s;ixth part thereof is inhabited, and that to the South-Ea&s;t only. The re&s;t lies de&s;art, where the Temples only &s;tand. 'Tis true that the Suburbs, which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;trangers, do con&s;ide|rably increa&s;e the number of the People. The &s;treets thereof are large and &s;trait, and in &s;ome places planted with Trees, and paved with Bricks laid edge|wi&s;e. The Hou&s;es are low, and built with Wood; at lea&s;t tho&s;e belonging to the Natives, who, for the&s;e Rea&s;ons, are expo&s;ed to all the Inconveniences of the exce&s;&s;ive heat. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are watered with &s;trait Canals, which have made <HI>Siam</HI> to be compar'd to <HI>Venice,</HI> and on which are a great many &s;mall Bridges of Hurdles, and &s;ome of Brick very high and ugly.</P>

<P><HI>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto</HI> relates that the King of <HI>Siam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Ex|ample of the Revolutions of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> who reigned in 1547, and to whom he gives great Prai&s;es, was poy&s;on'd by the Queen his Wife at his return from a military Expedition. This Prince&s;s deliberated thus to prevent the vengeance of her Husband, by rea&s;on that during his ab&s;ence &s;he had maintain'd an amorous Commerce, by which &s;he prov'd with Child. And this Author adds, that &s;he &s;oon after de&s;troy'd the King her own Son in the &s;ame manner, and had the Credit to get the Crown &s;et upon her Lover's Head the 11^t^h of <HI>November</HI> 1548. But in <HI>January</HI> 1549, they were both a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated in a Temple, and a Ba&s;tard Prince, the Brother and Uncle of the two la&s;t Kings, was taken out of a Cloy&s;ter to be advanced on the Throne. The Crowns of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are always in&s;table, and tho&s;e of <HI>India, China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> much more than the others.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the Origine of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> it would be difficult to judge whether they are only a &s;ingle People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Doubt as to the Origine of the <HI>Siame|&s;es.</HI></NOTE> directly de&s;cended from the fir&s;t Men that inhabited the Countrey of <HI>Siam,</HI> or whether in proce&s;s of time &s;ome other Nation has not al&s;o &s;etled there, notwith&s;tanding the fir&s;t Inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>The principal Rea&s;on of this Doubt proceeds from the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> under&s;tand|ing two Languages, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vulgar, which is a &s;imple Tongue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two Langua|ges at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> con&s;i&s;ting almo&s;t wholly of Mono&s;yllables, without Conjugation or Declen&s;ion; and another Lan|guage which I have already &s;poken of, which to them is a dead Tongue, known only by the Learned, which is called the <HI>Balie</HI> Tongue, and which is enricht with the inflexions of words, like the Languages we have in <HI>Europe.</HI> The terms of Religion and Ju&s;tice, the names of Offices, and all the Ornaments of the Vulgar Tongue are borrow'd from the <HI>Balie.</HI> In this Language they compo&s;e their be&s;t Songs; &s;o that it &s;eems at lea&s;t that &s;ome Foreign Colony had for|merly inhabited the Countrey of <HI>Siam,</HI> and had carry'd thither a &s;econd Lan|guage. But this is a Di&s;pute that might be rais'd concerning all the Countries of <HI>India;</HI> for, like <HI>Siam,</HI> they all have two Languages, one of which is &s;till re|maining only in their Books.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> a&s;&s;ert that their Laws are Foreign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> report concerning the Origine of their Laws and Religion.</NOTE> and came to them from the Countrey of <HI>Laos,</HI> which has, perhaps, no other Foundation than the Confor|mity of the Laws of <HI>Laos</HI> with tho&s;e of <HI>Siam,</HI> even as there is a Conformity between the Religions of the&s;e two Nations, and with that of the <HI>Peguins.</HI> Now this does not &s;trictly prove that any of the&s;e three Kingdoms hath given its Laws and its Religion to the re&s;t, &s;eeing that it may happen that all the three may have deriv'd their Religion and their Laws from another common Source. However it be, as the Tradition is at <HI>Siam,</HI> that their Laws and Kings came from <HI>Laos,</HI> the &s;ame Tradition runs at <HI>Laos,</HI> that their Kings and mo&s;t of their Laws came from <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="11"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Balie</HI> Language.</NOTE>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> &s;peak not of any Country where the <HI>Balie</HI> Language, which is that of their Laws and their Religion, is now in u&s;e. They &s;u&s;pect indeed, according to the report of &s;ome among&s;t them, which have been at the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> that the <HI>Balie</HI> Language has &s;ome &s;imilitude with &s;ome one of the Dialects of that Country: but they agree at the &s;ame time that the Letters of the <HI>Balie</HI> Language are known only among&s;t them. The &s;ecular Mi&s;&s;ionaries e&s;tabli&s;hed at <HI>Siam,</HI> are of opinion that this Language is not entirely extinct: by rea&s;on they &s;aw in their Ho&s;pital a man come from about the Cape of <HI>Como|rin,</HI> who inter&s;pers'd &s;everal <HI>Balie</HI> words in his di&s;cour&s;e, affirming that they were u&s;ed in his Country, and that he had never &s;tudied, and knew only his Mother Tongue. They moreover averr for truth, that the Religion of the <HI>Siu|me&s;es</HI> came from tho&s;e Quarters, becau&s;e that they have read in a <HI>Balie</HI> Book, that <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> whom the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> adore, was the Son of a King of the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon.</HI></P>

<P>THe Country of <HI>Siam</HI> lyes almo&s;t wholly incultivated and cover'd with Woods. One of their mo&s;t eminent Trees is a kind of Reed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bambou.</HI></NOTE> called in <HI>Indi|an, Mambou,</HI> in <HI>Portugue&s;e, Bambou,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e, Mai pai.</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> apply it to an in|finite number of u&s;es. <HI>Aelian lib.</HI> 4. <HI>cap.</HI> 34. mentions it as their mo&s;t ancient nou|ri&s;hment. At pre&s;ent they u&s;e it little; and that only in &s;ome of their di&s;hes, when it is tender; and to pre&s;erve it, they Pickle it up in Vinegar, as we do <HI>Cucumbers</HI> and <HI>Samphire.</HI> This Tree re&s;embles the Poplar, it is &s;trait and tall, and the Leaves thereof few, pale, and longi&s;h. It is hollow, and grows in &s;hoots like our Reeds, and its &s;hoots are &s;eparated from one another by knots: but it has Branches and Thorns, which our Reeds have not. It grows very clo&s;e, and the &s;ame Roots do &s;hoot forth &s;everal &s;tems, &s;o that nothing is thick|er or more difficult to pa&s;s than a Fore&s;t of <HI>Bambou;</HI> and &s;o much the more be|cau&s;e the wood thereof is hard and difficult to cut, although it be ea&s;ie to cleave. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do &s;et it on fire by Friction, which is a token of its hardne&s;s. They have two pieces of <HI>Bambou</HI> cle&s;t, which are like two pieces of Lath, in the edge of the one they do make a notch, and do forcibly rub in this hole with the edge of the other, as with a Saw; and &s;ome dry leaves, or other combu&s;tible matter, which is put in the notch, fails not to catch fire without firing the <HI>Bambou.</HI> There is no Reed but has naturally &s;omewhat either more or le&s;s of a Sugary juice. That of the <HI>Bambou</HI> is famous in &s;ome places of <HI>India,</HI> as an excellent Remedy for &s;everal Maladies. It e&s;caped my curio&s;ity to ask whether the Sugar of the <HI>Bambou</HI> of <HI>Siam</HI> is as much &s;ought after upon this account, as that of the <HI>Bambou</HI> of <HI>Malaca,</HI> which is not far di&s;tant.</P>

'Tis from the Branches of this Tree, &s;o frequently de&s;cribed in the Relations of <HI>India,</HI> that &s;everal Fibers do hang down to the ground, which there take root, and become as &s;o many new Trunks: &s;o that by little and little this Tree gains a con&s;iderable plot of ground, on which it forms a kind of Labyrinth by its &s;tems, which continually multiply, and which adhere to one another by the branches, from which the&s;e &s;tems are fall'n. We have &s;een the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> &s;eek out other Remedies again&s;t the Gnats than that of this wood: and this per&s;wades me either that it is very rare, or that this vertue which is attributed there|unto, is not well atte&s;ted.</P>

In a word, &s;ome &s;ay that the be&s;t way to render the Varni&s;h more curious, is to lay on the more coverings, but this is to make it much dearer. The Relations of <HI>China</HI> do al&s;o declare, that there are two diffe|rent Materials for the Varni&s;h, and that the one is much better than the other. The <HI>Cheyram</HI> is proved by a drop thereof pour'd into Water; and if this drop &s;inks to the bottom without &s;eparating, the <HI>Cheyram</HI> is good.</P>

<P>The <HI>Levantines,</HI> or Ea&s;tern People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or in milk.</NOTE> do &s;ometimes boil <HI>Rice</HI> with Fle&s;h and Pepper, and then put &s;ome Saffron thereunto, and this Di&s;h they call <HI>Pilau.</HI> This is not the practice of the <HI>Siame&s;es:</HI> but generally they boil the <HI>Rice</HI> in clear wa|ter, as I have &s;aid; and &s;ometimes they boil it with milk, as we do on fa&s;ting days.</P>
<P>At <HI>Siam,</HI> in the Lands high enough to avoid the Inundation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wheat.</NOTE> there grows Wheat: they water them either with watering Pots like tho&s;e in our Gardens, or by overflowing it with the Rain-water, which they keep in Ci&s;terns much higher than the&s;e Lands. But either by rea&s;on of the Care or Expence, or that the <HI>Rice</HI> &s;uffices for common u&s;e, the King of <HI>Siam</HI> only has Wheat; and perhaps more out of Curio&s;ity, than a real Gu&s;to. They call it <HI>Kaou Po&s;&s;ali,</HI> and the word <HI>Kaou</HI> &s;imply &s;ignifieth <HI>Rice.</HI> Now the&s;e terms being neither <HI>Ara|bian,</HI> nor <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> nor <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> I doubt of what was told me, that Wheat was brought to <HI>Siam</HI> by the <HI>Moors.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> which are &s;etled there, do import Meal from <HI>Surrat;</HI> altho' near <HI>Siam</HI> there is a Windmil to grind Corn, and ano|ther near <HI>Louvo.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, the Bread which the King of <HI>Siam</HI> gave us, was &s;o dry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wheaten Bread too dry at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> that the <HI>Rice</HI> boil'd in pure water, how in&s;ipid &s;oever, was more agreeable to me. I le&s;s wonder therefore at what the Relations of <HI>China</HI> report, that the Soveraign of this great Kingdom, altho' he has Bread, does rather prefer <HI>Rice:</HI> yet &s;ome <HI>Euro|peans</HI> a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the wheaten Bread of <HI>Siam</HI> is good, and that the drine&s;s of ours mu&s;t proceed from a little Rice-flower, which is doubtle&s;s mixt with the Wheat, for fear perhaps le&s;t the Bread &s;hould fail.</P>
<P>At <HI>Siam</HI> I have &s;een Pea&s;e different from ours. The <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> like us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Grain.</NOTE> do make more than one Crop, but they make only one in a year upon the &s;ame Land: not that the Soil was not good enough, in my opinion, to yield two Crops in a year, as &s;ome have related concerning &s;ome other Cantons of <HI>India,</HI> if the Inundation did not la&s;t &s;o long. They have Turky-Wheat only in their Gardens. They do boil or parch the whole Ear thereof, without unhusking or breaking off the Grains, and they eat the in&s;ide.</P>

They guide them with a Rope put through a hole which they make in the Cartilage that &s;eparates the No&s;trils: And to the end that the Rope may not &s;lip when they draw it, they do tie a knot on each &s;ide. This &s;ame Cord runs al&s;o through a hole, which is at the end of the draught Tree of their Plough.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Plough.</NOTE>The Plough of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> is plain, and without Wheels.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they clean&s;e the Rice from the Chaff.</NOTE>To unhusk the <HI>Rice,</HI> they employ large Bea&s;ts; when it is trodden out; they let it fall by little and little from a very high place, to the end that the wind may carry away the Chaff. And becau&s;e the <HI>Rice</HI> has an hard Skin like Spelt, a &s;ort of Corn very common in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and other places, they brui&s;e it in a great wooden Mortar, with a Pe&s;tle of the &s;ame; or in a Hand-mill, all the pieces of which are al&s;o of Wood. They knew not how to de&s;cribe them to me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Sea&s;ons only, and two &s;orts of years.</NOTE>They know only three Sea&s;ons, the <HI>Winter,</HI> which they call <HI>Nanaou, the Begin|ning of Cold;</HI> the <HI>Little Summer,</HI> which they call <HI>Naron, the Beginning of Heat;</HI> and the <HI>Great Summer,</HI> which they call <HI>Naron-yai, the Beginning of Great Heat;</HI> and which &s;trips the Trees of their Leaves, as the Cold does ours.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The names of their days from the Planets.</NOTE>They have no word to expre&s;s <HI>Week;</HI> but, like us, they call the &s;even days by the Planets, and their days corre&s;pond to ours. I mean, that when it is Monday here, it is Monday there, and &s;o of the re&s;t; but the day begins about &s;ix hours &s;ooner there, than here.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From whence they begin their years.</NOTE>They begin their year on the fir&s;t day of the Moon in <HI>November</HI> or <HI>December,</HI> according to certain Rules; and they do not always denote the years by their number, but by the names they give them; for they make u&s;e of a Cycle of &s;ixty years, like the other Ea&s;tern Nations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cycle of 60 years.</NOTE>A Sexagenary Cycle is a Revolution of &s;ixty years, as a week is a Revolu|tion of &s;even days; and they have names for the years of the Cycle, as we have for the days of the week. 'Tis true, I have not been able to di&s;cover that they have more than twelve different names, which they repeat five times in every Cycle to arrive at the number of &s;ixty, and in my opinion with &s;ome ad|ditions which do make the differences thereof. They will date therefore, for in&s;tance, from the year of the <HI>Pigg,</HI> or of the <HI>Great Serpent,</HI> which among&s;t them are the names of the year; and they will not always denote what year of their <HI>Aera</HI> this &s;hall be, as we &s;ometimes date a Letter upon one of the days of the week to which we &s;et down the name, without noting what number it is in the month. At the end of this Relation, I will give you the twelve names of the years in <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> with tho&s;e of the &s;even days of the week.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their months.</NOTE>Their months are vulgarly e&s;teem'd to con&s;i&s;t of thirty days. I &s;ay vulgar|ly, becau&s;e that in A&s;tronomical exactne&s;s there may be &s;ome month longer or &s;horter; but the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do ob&s;erve it otherwi&s;e than we, in that we give names to the months, and they do not.

<PB N="19" REF="16">
Winter at the &s;ame time as we; by rea&s;on they lye to the North line like us. But their greate&s;t Winter is at lea&s;t as hot as our greate&s;t Summer. After the time of the Inundation they cover the Plants in their Gardens from the heats of the Sun, as we do &s;ometimes cover ours from the cold of the Night or Winter: But as to their Per&s;ons, the diminution of the heat appears unto them a very in|commodious cold. The little Summer is their Spring, and they utterly ignore the Autumn. They only reckon a great Summer; although it &s;eems that they might reckon two after the manner of the Ancients, who have written of <HI>India,</HI> &s;eeing that they have the Sun perpendicularly over their heads twice a year; once when it comes from the Line to the Tropick of <HI>Cancer,</HI> and another time when it returns from the Tropick of <HI>Cancer</HI> towards the Line.</P>
<P>Their Winter is dry, and their Summer rainy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Mon|&s;oons.</HI></NOTE> The Torrid Zone would doubt|le&s;s be uninhabitable, as the Ancients have held, were it not for that marvellous Providence which makes the Sun continually to draw the Clouds and Rains af|ter it, and the Wind ince&s;&s;antly to blow there from one of the Poles, when the Sun is toward the other. Thus at <HI>Siam</HI> in Winter, the Sun being in the mid|dle of the Line, or towards the Antarctick Pole, the North-winds do con&s;tant|ly prevail, and temper the Air very &s;en&s;ibly to refre&s;h it. In Summer, when the Sun is on the North of the Line, and perpendicularly over the head of the <HI>Si|ame&s;es,</HI> the South-winds which continually blow there, do cau&s;e continual Rains, or at lea&s;t do make the weather always inclined to Rain; leaving mo&s;t People in doubt whether this Sea&s;on of Rains ought not to be called the Winter of <HI>Siam.</HI> 'Tis this con&s;tant Rule of the Winds, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have called <HI>Mon&ccedil;aos,</HI> and we after them <HI>Mon&s;oons (Motiones a&euml;ris,</HI> according to <HI>Ozorius</HI> and <HI>Maffeus.</HI>) And this is the rea&s;on that the Ships can hardly arrive at the Bar of <HI>Siam</HI> during the &s;ix Months of the North-winds, and that they can hardly depart thence during the &s;ix Months of the South-winds. At the end of this work I will give the order of the Winds and Tides in the Gulph of <HI>Siam,</HI> in favour of tho&s;e that love to rea&s;on on Philo&s;ophical matters.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do not give many forms to their Lands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The time of ploughing and reaping.</NOTE> They till them and &s;owe them, when the Rains have &s;ufficiently &s;oftened them; and they gather their harve&s;t when the waters are retired, and &s;ometimes when they are yet remain|ing on the ground, and they can go only by Boat. All the land that is over|flowed is good for Rice, and 'tis &s;aid that the Ear always &s;urmounts the waters; and that if they encrea&s;e a foot in twenty four hours, the Rice grows a foot al&s;o in twenty four hours: but though it be averr'd that this happens &s;ometimes, I cannot without much difficulty believe it in &s;o va&s;t an Inundation: And I ra|ther conceive that when the Inundation &s;urmounts the Rice at any time, it rots it.</P>
<P>They gather Rice al&s;o in divers Cantons of the Kingdom which the Rains do not overflow; and this is more &s;ub&s;tantial, better reli&s;ht, and keeps longer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another &s;ort of Rice.</NOTE>
When it has grown long enough in the Land where it was &s;own, it is tran&s;plant|ed into another, which is prepared after this manner. They overflow it, as we do the Salt Mar&s;hes, until it be throughly &s;oft; and for this purpo&s;e it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to have high Ci&s;terns, or rather to keep the Rain-water in the Field it &s;elf by little Banks made all round. Then they let the water go to feed the Land, level it, and in fine, tran&s;plant the Rice-Roots one after the other, by thru&s;ting them in with the Thumb.</P>
<P>I am greatly inclin'd to believe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The original of Agriculture with the <HI>Sia|me&s;es.</HI></NOTE> that the Ancient <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> lived only upon Fruits and Fi&s;h, as &s;till do &s;everal people of the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk;</HI> and that in proce&s;s of time Husbandry has been taught them by the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> We read in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>China</HI> that 'twas anciently the King him&s;elf, that annually fir&s;t &s;et his hand to the Plough in this great Kingdom, and that of the Crop which his Labour yielded him, he made the Bread for the Sacrifices. The Lawful King of <HI>Tonquin</HI> and <HI>Cochinchina</HI> together, who is called the <HI>Buado</HI>'s, likewi&s;e ob&s;erve this Cu&s;tom of fir&s;t breaking up the Lands every year; and of all the Royal Functions, this is almo&s;t the only one remaining to him.

they profe&s;s to acknowledge the <HI>Bua,</HI> which is at <HI>Tonquin,</HI> for their Soveraign.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ceremo|ny of the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> touching Agriculture.</NOTE>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> did formerly al&s;o &s;et his hand to the Plough, on a certain day of the year: For about an Age &s;ince, and upon &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious Ob&s;erva|tion of a bad Omen, he labours no more; but leaves this Ceremony to an ima|ginary King, which is purpo&s;ely created every year: yet they will not permit him to bear the Title of King, but that of <HI>Oc-ya-Kaou,</HI> or <HI>Oc-ya</HI> of the <HI>Rice.</HI> He is mounted upon an Ox, and rides to the place where he mu&s;t plough, attended with a great train of Officers that are obedient to him. This Ma&s;querade for one day gets him wherewithal to live on the whole year. And by the &s;ame &s;u|per&s;tition has deterred the Kings them&s;elves.

They fir&s;t rince the Earthen <HI>Bouli</HI> with boiling water to heat it, then they put in as much <HI>Tea,</HI> as one can take up with the Finger and Thumb, and afterwards fill it with boiling water; and after having covered it, they &s;till pour boiling water on the out&s;ide, they &s;top not the Spout as we do. When the Tea is &s;ufficiently infu|&s;ed, that is to &s;ay when the Leaves are precipitated, they pour the Liquor into <HI>China</HI> di&s;hes; which at fir&s;t they fill only half, to the end that if it appear too &s;trong or too deep, they may temper it, by pouring in pure water, which they &s;till keep boiling in the Copper <HI>Bouly.</HI> Neverthele&s;s if they will &s;till drink, they do again fill the Earthen <HI>Bouly</HI> with this boiling water, and &s;o they may do &s;everal times without adding any more <HI>Tea,</HI> until they &s;ee that the water re|ceives no tincture. They put no Sugar into the Di&s;hes, by rea&s;on they have none refin'd which is not candy, and the candy melts too &s;lowly. They do therefore take a little in their mouth, which they champ as they drink their <HI>Tea.</HI> When they would have no more <HI>Tea,</HI> they turn the Cup down on the Saucer; becau&s;e that 'tis the greate&s;t incivility among them to refu&s;e any thing, and that if they leave the Cup &s;tanding, they fail not to &s;erve them again with <HI>Tea,</HI> which they are oblig'd to receive. But they forbear to fill the Di&s;h, unle&s;s they would te&s;tifie to him unto whom they pre&s;ent it full, that 'tis, as &s;ome &s;ay, for once, and that it is not expected that he ever come again to the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellent wa|ter nece&s;&s;ary for Tea.</NOTE>The mo&s;t experienced do &s;ay that the Water cannot be too clear for Tea, that Ci&s;tern-water is the be&s;t as being the mo&s;t pure, and that the fine&s;t <HI>Tea</HI> in the world becomes bad in water, which is not excellent.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether it is nece&s;&s;ary to drink the Tea hot.</NOTE>In a word, if the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> drink <HI>Tea</HI> &s;o hot, 'tis not perhaps that they have found it either more whole&s;om or more plea&s;ant after this manner; for they drink all &s;orts of Liquor at the &s;ame degree of heat, unle&s;s the Tartars have now taught them, as it is &s;aid, to drink Ice. 'Tis true that the infu&s;ion of Tea is perform'd quicker in hot water than cold; but I have drunk with plea&s;ure what I had infu&s;ed cold for above a day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> adhere not to Tea: they freely drink Wine, when they have it; altho whatever inebriates is prohibited them by their Morality.

<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do e&s;teem fruit better than all things;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE> they eat all the day long if they have it. But excepting <HI>Oranges, Citrons</HI> and <HI>Pomegranates,</HI> there is not at <HI>Siam</HI> any of the fruits that we know. The Citrons which they call <HI>Ma-crout,</HI> are &s;mall, full of Juice and very &s;owre, and the skin very &s;mooth. They appeared to me of a &s;ingular quality, in that they are rotten on the in&s;ide, when their peel is &s;ound and entire. But they have moreover a kind of &s;owre, and no &s;weet Lemons, and on the contrary the Oranges and Pomegranates are all &s;weet; un|le&s;s for &s;owre Oranges they would take the <HI>Pampelmou&s;es,</HI> which have the ta&s;te and &s;hape thereof, but which are as big as Melons, and have not much Juice.

Tho&s;e excellent Canes of one &s;ingle Shoot or Joynt, between nine and ten foot long, do grow only at <HI>Achem;</HI> but Rice, which is their principal nouri&s;hment, frequently fails them: and they do then dearly purcha&s;e it with the Gold, which they find &s;o plenti|fully among&s;t them, that they contemn it. without Philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>I de&s;ignedly omit the De&s;cription of &s;everal Fruits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference of the Fruits of <HI>Siam</HI> from ours.</NOTE> and refer it to the end of this work. I will now only &s;peak of the <HI>Areca,</HI> and &s;hall &s;ay of the <HI>Indian</HI> Fruits in general, that they have for the mo&s;t part &s;o &s;trong a ta&s;te and &s;mell, that one loves them not, till accu&s;tomed thereunto; and I think that then they do no hurt. By a contrary rea&s;on, our Fruits are at fir&s;t in&s;ipid and without flavor, to him that is accu&s;tomed to the <HI>Indian</HI> Fruits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Areca,</HI> which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Plou,</HI> is a kind of great Acorn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Areca</HI> and <HI>Betel,</HI></NOTE> which yet wants that wooden Cup wherein our Acorn grows: When this Fruit is yet tender, it has at the center or heart a greyi&s;h &s;ub&s;tance, which is as &s;oft as Pap. As it drys it waxes yellower and harder, and the &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance it has at the heart grows hard too: It is always very bitter and &s;avory. After having cut it into four parts with a Knife, they take a piece every time, and chew it with a Leaf re&s;embling Ivy called <HI>Betel</HI> by the <HI>Europeans</HI> which are at the <HI>Indies,</HI> and <HI>Mak</HI> by the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI> They wrap it up to put it the more ea&s;ily into the mouth, and do put on each a &s;mall quantity of Lime made of Cockle-&s;hells, and redded by I know not what art. For this rea&s;on the <HI>Indians</HI> do always carry this &s;ort of Lime in a very little <HI>China</HI> di&s;h, for they put &s;o little on every Leaf, that they con&s;ume not much In a day, altho they ince&s;&s;antly make u&s;e of the <HI>Areca,</HI> and the <HI>Betel.</HI> The <HI>Areca</HI> whil&s;t tender wholly con&s;umes in the Mouth, but the dry always leaves &s;ome remains.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="19"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their effect.</NOTE>The &s;en&s;ible effect of this Acorn and this Leaf is to excite much &s;pitting, if they care not to &s;wallow the Juice; but it is good to &s;pit out the two or three fir&s;t Mouthfuls at lea&s;t, to avoid &s;wallowing the Lime. The other le&s;s &s;en&s;ible effects, but which are not doubted in the <HI>Indies,</HI> are to carry from the Gums, perhaps by rea&s;on of the Lime, whatever may prejudice them, and to fortifie the Stomach, either by rea&s;on of the Juice that is &s;wallowed at plea&s;ure, and which may have this quality, or by rea&s;on of the &s;uperfluous moi&s;tures which they di&s;charge by &s;pitting. Thus have I never found any per&s;on at <HI>Siam</HI> with a &s;tinking breath, which may be an effect of their natural Sobriety.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another effect of the <HI>Areca</HI> and <HI>Betel.</HI></NOTE>Now as the <HI>Areca</HI> and <HI>Betel</HI> do cau&s;e a red &s;pittle independently on the red Lime which is mix'd therewith, &s;o they leave a Vermilion Tincture on the Lips and Teeth. It pa&s;&s;es over the Lips, but by little and little it thickens on the Teeth till they become black: So that per&s;ons that delight in neatne&s;s, do blacken their Teeth, by rea&s;on that otherwi&s;e the &s;pittle of the <HI>Areca</HI> and <HI>Betel,</HI> mix'd with the natural whitene&s;s of the Teeth, cau&s;es an unplea&s;ant effect, which is remarked in the common People. I &s;hall tran&s;iently declare, that the Vermi|lion Lips, which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> &s;aw in the Pictures of our Ladies which we had carried to this Country, made them to &s;ay that we mu&s;t needs have in <HI>France,</HI> better <HI>Betel</HI> than theirs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they blacken their Teeth, and how they red|den the Nails of their little fingers.</NOTE>To blacken their Teeth, they do thereon put &s;ome pieces of very &s;owre Le|mon, which they hold on their Jaws or Lips for an hour, or more. They report that this &s;oftens the Teeth a little. They afterwards rub them with a Juice, which proceeds either from a certain Root, or from the <HI>Coco,</HI> when they are burnt, and &s;o the operation is perform'd. Yet it plea&s;es them &s;ometimes to relate that it continues three days, during which it is nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;ay, to lye on their Belly and eat no &s;olid Food: But &s;ome have a&s;&s;ur'd me that this is not true, and that it is &s;ufficient to eat nothing hot for two or three days. I be|lieve rather that their Teeth are too much &s;et on edge, to be able for &s;ome time to eat any thing &s;olid. It is nece&s;&s;ary continually to renew this operation to make the effect thereof continue; for this Blackne&s;s &s;ticks not &s;o &s;trong to the Teeth, but that it may be rub'd off with a burnt Cru&s;t of Bread reduc'd to Pow|der. They love al&s;o to redden the Nails of their little Fingers, and for this end they &s;crape them, and then apply a certain Juice, which they extract from a lit|tle Rice brui&s;ed in Citron Juice with &s;ome Leaves of a ree, which in every thing re&s;embles the Pomegranate Tree, but bears no Fruit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>Pal|mites</HI> in gene|ral.</NOTE>In brief, the <HI>Arequier</HI> or <HI>Arectree,</HI> and all the Trees which are called <HI>Palmites,</HI> have no Branches, but great, long and broad Leaves, like the Palm-tree; and they have their Leaves only at the top of the &s;talk, which is hollow. The&s;e &s;orts of Trees do annually produce a new Shoot of Leaves, which &s;pring out of the middle of the Leaves of the preceeding year, which then fall off, and leave a mark round the Trunk; &s;o that by the&s;e marks which are &s;o many knots, and which are clo&s;e together, they can ea&s;ily compute the Years, or Age of the Tree.</P>

'Twas nece&s;&s;ary to give the <HI>French</HI> Sol|diers &s;ome <HI>Pagnes</HI> to wa&s;h in, to remove the Complaints which the&s;e People made, at &s;eeing them go all naked into the River.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="21">The Infants go there without a <HI>Pagne</HI> to four or five years of age, but when once of that age, they are never uncover'd to cha&s;ti&s;e them; and in the Ea&s;t it is an exceeding Infamy to be beaten naked on the parts of the Body, which are generally conceal'd.</P>
<P>'Tis from hence perhaps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they cha&s;ti&s;e with the Cudgel.</NOTE> that the u&s;e of the Cudgel &s;prang up among&s;t them in cha&s;ti&s;ing, by rea&s;on that neither the Whip, nor the Rod, would be &s;ufficiently felt through their Cloaths.</P>
<P>Moreover, they pluck not off their Cloaths to lie down,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode&s;ty in the Bed, and al&s;o in the Bath.</NOTE> or at lea&s;t they only change the <HI>Pagne,</HI> as they do to bathe them&s;elves in the River. The Women bathe them&s;elves like the Men, and do exerci&s;e them&s;elves in &s;wimming; and in no part of the world do they &s;wim better.</P>
<P>Their Mode&s;ty renders the Cu&s;tom of Bathing almo&s;t in&s;upportable unto them, and few among&s;t them can re&s;olve to do it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other Proofs of their Mo|de&s;ty.</NOTE> They have affixt Infamy to Nakedne&s;s: And they are no le&s;s careful about the Mode&s;ty of the Ears, than of the Eyes; &s;eeing that impure and baudy Songs are prohibited by the Laws of <HI>Siam,</HI> as well as by tho&s;e of <HI>China.</HI> Yet I cannot affirm that they may not be us'd at all; for the Laws prohibit no other, than the Exce&s;s already too much e&s;tabli&s;h'd: And from <HI>China</HI> there comes &s;ome Porcelane Figures and Paintings &s;o immode&s;t, that they are no more permitted than the Baudie&s;t Songs.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Pagnes</HI> that are of an extraordinary beauty and gaudine&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What <HI>Pagnes</HI> are permitted.</NOTE> as tho&s;e of Silk with Embroidery, or without Embroidery, and tho&s;e of painted Linnen very fine, are permitted to tho&s;e only to whom the Prince pre&s;ents them. The Women of Quality do greatly e&s;teem the black <HI>Pagnes,</HI> and their Scarf is fre|quently of plain white Mu&s;lin.</P>
<P>They wear Rings on the three la&s;t Fingers of each Hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rings, Brace|lets, Pendants.</NOTE> and the Fa&s;hion permits them to put on as many as po&s;&s;ibly can be kept on. They freely give half a Crown for Rings with fal&s;e Stones, which at <HI>Paris</HI> co&s;t not above two Sols. They have no Necklaces to adorn their Necks, nor their Wives; but the Women and Children of both Sexes wear Pendants. They are generally of Gold, Silver, or Vermilion gilt, in the &s;hape of a Pear. The young Boys and Girls of a good Family have Bracelets, but only to &s;ix or &s;even years of Age; and they equally wear them on their Arms and Legs. They are Rings of Gold, or Silver, or Vermilion gilt.</P>
<P>As the&s;e People have their Body of another Colour than ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Naked|ne&s;s &s;urprizeth not.</NOTE> it &s;eems that our Eyes do not think them Naked, at lea&s;t their Nakedne&s;s has nothing which &s;urprized me; whereas a Naked White Man, when I met one, always appear'd a new Object unto me.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are rather Small, than Great;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Statute of the <HI>Sia|me&s;es.</HI></NOTE> but their Bodies are well pro|portion'd, which I principally attribute to their not &s;wadling in their Infancy. The care that we take to form the &s;hape of our Children, is not always &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;sful, as the liberty which they leave to Nature to proceed in forming theirs. 'Tis true, that the Brea&s;ts of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Women uphold not them&s;elves from their Childhood, and hang down rather to their Navel; but otherwi&s;e, their Body is well proportioned, and their hanging Brea&s;ts offend not the Eyes of their Husbands: &s;o true it is that the Phanta&s;ies, even they which &s;eem to be mo&s;t natural, do greatly con&s;i&s;t in Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>The &s;hape of their Faces, as well of the Men as Women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Meen.</NOTE> participate le&s;s of the Oval, than the Lozenge; it is broad and high at the Cheek-bones, and on a &s;udden their Forehead contracts and terminates almo&s;t as much in a Point, as their Chin. Moreover, their Eyes &s;lit a little upwards are &s;mall, and not over|brisk, and the white thereof is generally yellowi&s;h. Their Jaws are hollow, by rea&s;on they are too high above; their Mouths are large, their Lips thick and pale, and their Teeth blacken'd. Their Complexion is gro&s;s, and of a brown mix'd with red, unto which the continual Sun-burning contributes as much as the Birth.</P>
<P>The Women u&s;e neither Paint nor Patches; but I have &s;een a great Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A blue Co|lour laid on the Body.</NOTE>
who&s;e Legs were blu'd with a dull Blue, like that mark which the Gunpowder leaves. They that &s;hew'd me it, inform'd me that it was a thing affected by the
<PB N="28" REF="22">
Great Men, that they had more or le&s;s blue according to their dignity; and that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> was blu'd from the &s;ole of his Feet, to the hollow of his Stomach. Others a&s;&s;ur'd me that it was not out of Grandeur, but Super|&s;tition; and others would make me to doubt whether the King of <HI>Siam</HI> was blue. I know not how it is.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The No&s;e and Ears of the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></NOTE>The <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> as I have &s;aid, have their No&s;e &s;hort and round at the end, and their Ears bigger than ours; and the larger they have them, the more they e&s;teem them: A Phanta&s;y common to all the Ea&s;t, as it appears by all the Statues of Porcelane and other matter, which come from thence. But in this there is a difference among&s;t the Orientals; for &s;ome do &s;tretch their Ears at the tip to lengthen them, without boring them any more than is nece&s;&s;ary to put Pendants therein. Others, after having bor'd them, do by little and little enlarge the hole, to thru&s;t in bigger and bigger Sticks: And it happens, e&s;pe|cially in the Country of <HI>Laos,</HI> that they can almo&s;t thru&s;t their Fi&s;t into the hole, and that the tip of the Ear touches the Shoulders. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have Ears &s;omewhat bigger than ours, but naturally and without Artifice.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hair.</NOTE>Their Hair is black, thick and lank, and both Sexes wear it &s;o &s;hort, that all round the Head it reaches only to the top of the Ears. Underneath this they are very clo&s;ely &s;haved, and this Fa&s;hion plea&s;eth them. The Women rai&s;e it on their Forehead, yet without fa&s;tning it again; and &s;ome, e&s;pecially the <HI>Pe|guins,</HI> do let it grow behind, to wreath it. The young unmarried wear it af|ter a particular manner. They cut with Sci&s;&s;ars very clo&s;e the Crown of the Head, and then all round they pull off a &s;mall Circle of Hair about the thick|ne&s;s of two Crown-pieces, and underneath they let the re&s;t of their Hair grow down almo&s;t to their Shoulders. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by rea&s;on of the heat, do thus frequently &s;have the Crown of their Head, but they pluck off no|thing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fancy of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> for white Women.</NOTE>Now every one being in love with the things of his own Country, I doubted not but the Pictures of &s;ome of the mo&s;t beautiful per&s;ons of the Court, which I had brought into this Country, would ravi&s;h the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> into admiration. The painting thereof was better than that of tho&s;e little Pictures which are daily &s;ent into Foreign Countries; yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> hardly con&s;ider'd them, and that after the Pictures of the Royal Family, before which they re&s;pectively bowed them&s;elves, not daring &s;tedfa&s;tly to behold them, they exceedingly e&s;teemed that of the Duke of <HI>Montauzier,</HI> by rea&s;on of his high and warlike Meen. We asked two young <HI>Mandarins</HI> what they thought of a great Puppet or Baby, that we &s;hew'd them. One of them reply'd, that a Woman like this would be worth an hundred <HI>Catis,</HI> or fifteen thou&s;and Livres, and his Companion was of the &s;ame mind; but he added, that there was not any per&s;on at <HI>Siam</HI> that could purcha&s;e it. Whether they put &s;o high a value on a white Woman, either for the &s;ingular delight which they take in them, or only by rea&s;on that whatever comes from far, ought to be very dear, I leave to be determin'd. 'Tis certain, that whether it be Fancy, or Grandeur, the King of <HI>Siam</HI> has &s;ome white <HI>Mingrelian,</HI> or <HI>Georgian</HI> Women, which he purcha&s;es in <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> And the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> that had been in <HI>France</HI> acknowledg'd, that tho' they were not at fir&s;t very much &s;truck either with the whitene&s;s, or with the features of the <HI>French</HI> Women, yet they pre&s;ently apprehended that they alone were hand&s;om, and that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> were not. As to the habit of the Pup|pet, the two <HI>Mandarins</HI> ab&s;olutely contemn'd it, as too intricate and trouble&s;om for the Husband that would pull it off from his Wife: And I have &s;ince con|&s;ider'd, that they imagin'd perhaps that our Wives lay in their Cloaths, like theirs, which would doubtle&s;s be very trouble&s;om.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are very neat.</NOTE>As the Cloaths imbibe whatever the Body tran&s;pires, it is certain that the le&s;s one is cloath'd, the more ea&s;ie it is to be neat, as the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are. They perfume them&s;elves in &s;everal places of their Body. On their Lips they put a &s;ort of perfum'd Pomatum, which makes them appear much paler than naturally they are. They bathe them&s;elves three or four times a day, or oftner, and it is one of their Neatne&s;&s;es not to make a Vi&s;it of Con&s;e|quence without bathing; and in this ca&s;e they make a white &s;pot on the
<PB N="29" REF="22">
top of their Brea&s;t with a piece of Chalk, to &s;hew that they came from the Bath.</P>
<P>They bathe them&s;elves two ways,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ways of Bathing.</NOTE> either by going into the water after our fa&s;hion, or by cau&s;ing water to be pour'd over their Body with Ladles; and they &s;ometimes continue this &s;ort of Bathing for an hour. In a word, they need not to warm the water for their Dome&s;tic Baths, no notwith&s;tanding it has been kept &s;everal days, and in Winter; it always continues naturally hot.</P>
<P>They take care of their Teeth, altho' they black them:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Neatne&s;s of their Teeth and Hair.</NOTE> they wa&s;h their Hair with Water and &s;weet Oils, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do, and they u&s;e no more Powder than they; but they comb them&s;elves, which mo&s;t of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> do not. They have Combs from <HI>China,</HI> which in&s;tead of being all of a piece like ours, are only a great many Points or Teeth tied clo&s;e together with Wire. They pluck their Beard, and naturally have little; but they cut not their Nails, they are &s;a|tisfy'd to keep them neat.</P>
<P>We &s;aw &s;ome Dancers by Profe&s;&s;ion, who, for Beauty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Affecta|tion for long Nails.</NOTE> had put on very long Copper Nails, which made them appear like Harpies. At <HI>China,</HI> at lea&s;t before the Conque&s;t of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> the Cu&s;tom was neither to cut the Nails, nor the Hair, nor the Beard. The Men wore on their Heads a Net of Hair or Silk, which they fa&s;ten'd behind; and which not covering the top of the Head, left a &s;pace, through which they pull'd out their Hair, and then wreath'd and fa&s;ten'd it with a Bodkin. And it is &s;aid that this Dre&s;s on which they &s;ometimes al&s;o wore Bonnets, or a kind of Hats, did cau&s;e Megrims, and other very violent pains in their Head.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> and of their Architecture in Publick Buildings.</HEAD>
<P>IF the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are plain in their Habits, they are not le&s;s in their Hou&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> keep the &s;ame Simplicity in every thing.</NOTE> in their Furniture, and in their Food: Rich in a general Poverty, becau&s;e they know how to content them&s;elves with a little. Their Hou&s;es are &s;mall, but &s;urrounded with pretty large Grounds. Hurdles of cleft Bambou, oftentimes not clo&s;e compacted, do make the Floors, Walls and Roofs thereof. The Piles, on which they are erected to avoid the Inundation, are Bambou's as thick as one's Leg, and about 13 Foot above the Ground, by rea&s;on that the Waters do &s;ometimes ri&s;e as much as that. There never is more than four or &s;ix, on which they do lay other Bambou's acro&s;s in&s;tead of Beams. The Stairs are a Ladder of Bambou, which hangs on the out&s;ide like the Ladder of a Wind|mill. And by rea&s;on that their Stables are al&s;o in the Air, they have Climbers made of Hurdles, by which the Cattle enter therein.</P>
<P>If every Hou&s;e &s;tands &s;ingle, 'tis rather for the privacy of the Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hou&s;es &s;oon built.</NOTE> which would be di&s;cover'd through &s;uch thin Walls, than for fear of Fire: For be&s;ides that, they make their little Fire in the Courts and not in the Hou&s;es, it is im|po&s;&s;ible for them in any ca&s;e to con&s;ume any great matter. Three hundred Hou|&s;es which were burnt at <HI>Siam</HI> in our time, were rebuilt in two days. On a time when a Boom was &s;hot to plea&s;e the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> who beheld it at a di&s;tance, and from one of the Windows of his Palace, it was nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e to remove three Hou&s;es, and the Proprietors had taken and carry'd them away with their Furniture in le&s;s than an hour. Their Hearth or Chimney is a Basket full of Earth, and &s;upported with three Sticks like a Tripode. And thus they place the Fires wherewith they enclo&s;e great &s;paces in the Fore&s;ts for the hunting of the Elephants.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="23"><NOTE PLACE="marg">There are no Inns at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>'Tis in Hou&s;es of this Nature, or rather in the&s;e &s;orts of Tents, but bigger, that they lodged us along the River. They had built them purpo&s;ely for us, by rea&s;on there are not any wherein they could lodge us. There are no Inns at <HI>Siam,</HI> nor in any State of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> But in <HI>Turkey, Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Mogul</HI> there are <HI>Ca|ravan&s;era's</HI> for Travellers, that is to &s;ay public Buildings without Furniture, in which the <HI>Caravans</HI> may &s;helter them&s;elves, and here every one eats and lies according to the Provi&s;ions and Conveniences which he carries thither. In the Road from <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>Louvo,</HI> I &s;aw a Hall for this u&s;e. 'Tis a &s;pace about the bigne&s;s of an ordinary Hall, enclo&s;ed with a Wall about, as high as one may ea&s;ily lean over, and covered with a Roof, which is laid upon wooden Pillars &s;et at equal di&s;tances in the wall. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> does &s;ometimes dine there in his Travels, but as for particular per&s;ons, their Boats &s;erve them for their Inn.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;pitality why unknown among&s;t the People of <HI>A|&s;ia.</HI></NOTE>Ho&s;pitality is a Vertue unknown in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which in my opinion proceeds from the care that every one takes to conceal his Wives. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> practi&s;e it on|ly as to the Bea&s;ts, which they freely &s;uccour in their Di&s;tre&s;&s;es: But the <HI>Tala|poins</HI> having no Wives, they are more ho&s;pitable than the People. At <HI>Siam</HI> was a <HI>French</HI> man who re&s;olv'd to keep an Inn there; and &s;ome <HI>Europeans</HI> only did &s;ometimes go thither. And although among&s;t the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> as well as a|mong&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> it be an e&s;tabli&s;hed practice to entertain one another, yet it is rarely in this Country, and with much Ceremony: and e&s;pecially no open Table is there kept; &s;o that it would be difficult to lay out much in keeping a Table, if one would.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Hou&s;es were purpo&s;e|ly built for the King's Amba&s;&s;adors.</NOTE>There being no hou&s;e proper for us on the banks of the River, they built &s;ome after their Country fa&s;hion. Hurdles laid on Piles, and covered with Mats of Bulru&s;h, did not only make the Floors, but the Area of the Courts. The Hall and Chambers were hung with painted Cloaths, with Cielings of white Mu&s;lin, the extremities of which hung &s;loping. The Floors were cover'd with Ru&s;h|mats, finer and more &s;hining than tho&s;e of the Courts; and in the Chambers where the King's Amba&s;&s;adors lay, Tape&s;try-carpets were laid over the Mats. Neatne&s;s appeared every where, but no Magnificence. At <HI>Bancok, Siam,</HI> and <HI>Louvo,</HI> where the <HI>Europeans, Chine&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> have built Hou&s;es of Brick, they lodged us in Hou&s;es of this &s;ort, and not in Hou&s;es purpo&s;ely built for us.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Brick-Hou&s;es for the Am|ba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> which were not Fi|ni&s;hed.</NOTE>Yet we &s;aw two Brick Hou&s;es which the King of <HI>Siam</HI> had built, one for the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France,</HI> and the other for tho&s;e of <HI>Portugal,</HI> but they are not fi|ni&s;hed; by rea&s;on perhaps of the little probability there was, that they would be frequently inhabited. Moreover it is certain that this Prince begins &s;everal Brick buildings, and fini&s;hes few. The rea&s;on of which I know not.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;es of the great Officers of <HI>Si|am.</HI></NOTE>The great Officers of this Court have Timber Hou&s;es, which are &s;aid to be great Armories; but therein do lodge only the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, his Princi|pal Wife, and their Children. Every one of the other Wives with her Chil|dren, every Slave with his Family, have all their little Apartments &s;eparate and alone, but yet inclo&s;ed within the &s;ame Inclo&s;ure of <HI>Bambou</HI> with the Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e; altho they be &s;o many different Families.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hou&s;es have but one Story.</NOTE>One &s;ingle &s;tory &s;ufficeth them; and I am per&s;waded that this manner of building is more commodious to them than ours; &s;eeing that they are not &s;trait|ned for room (for there remains &s;ome in the City, and they take it where they plea&s;e) and &s;eeing they build with tho&s;e &s;light materials, which every one takes at plea&s;ure in the Woods, or which he buys at a low rate of him that has been there to take them. Neverthele&s;s it is reported that the rea&s;on why their Hou&s;es have but one &s;tory, is that no Per&s;on may be higher in his own Hou&s;e than the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> when he pa&s;&s;es thro the &s;treet mounted on his Elephant; and that further to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that they are all lower than this Prince when he goes either by Water or by Land, they mu&s;t &s;hut all their Windows, and come into the Street, or into their <HI>Balons</HI> to pro&s;trate them&s;elves.

Moreover his Palaces con&s;i&s;ting only of one &s;tory do &s;ufficiently evince, that this is the Phanta&s;ie of the Country in their Buildings; the true rea&s;on of which I will give you in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>The <HI>Europeans, Chine&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> do there build with Brick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brick-Hou&s;es for Foreign|ers.</NOTE> every one according to his Genius; for that they alone will be at the expence, as I conceive, or that they alone have the Liberty thereof, as it is reported. At the &s;ide of their Hou&s;es, to keep off the Sun and not hinder the Air, &s;ome do add Pent-hou&s;es, which are &s;ometimes &s;upported by Pillars. Others do make the bodies of the Hou&s;e double, which do reciprocally receive the light one from the other, to the end that the Air may pa&s;s from one to the other. The Chambers are large and full of Windows, to be the more fre&s;h and airy. And tho&s;e of the fir&s;t &s;tory have lights over the lower Hall, which ought to be &s;o called by rea&s;on of its heighth, and which &s;ometimes is almo&s;t all enclo&s;ed with Buildings, through which it receives the light. And 'tis this they call <HI>Divan,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> word which properly &s;ignifies a <HI>Council-Chamber,</HI> or <HI>Judgement-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>There are other &s;orts of <HI>Divans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Halls called <HI>Divan.</HI></NOTE> which being built on three &s;ides do want a fourth Wall, on that &s;ide which the Sun &s;hines lea&s;t on, in the whole Cour&s;e of the year, for between the Tropicks it illuminates every where according to the &s;everal Sea&s;ons. On the &s;ide which is open they do put a Pent-hou&s;e, as high as the Roof: and the in&s;ide of the <HI>Divan</HI> is frequently adorn'd from the top to the bottom with little Niches contrived either in the Wall, or in the Wain&s;cot, in which they put &s;ome <HI>China</HI> Di&s;hes. We had a <HI>Divan</HI> of this la&s;t &s;ort in our Hou&s;e at <HI>Siam;</HI> and in the Front under the Pent-hou&s;e there played a little Foun|tain.</P>

Moreover they are of the &s;hape of our Chappels, but without Vaults, or Cielings; only the Timber-work which &s;upports the Tiles, is varni&s;hed with red inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome &s;treaks of Gold.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>China</HI>'s Palace is &s;till of Wood;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Brick-Build|ings modern at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> and this per&s;wades me that Brick Buildings are very modern at <HI>Siam,</HI> and that the <HI>Europeans</HI> have there in|troduced the practice and u&s;e thereof.

<P>In a word, they know no exterior Ornament for Palaces, nor for Temples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They know not the five Orders of Ar|chitecture.</NOTE>
&s;ave in the Roofs, which they cover with that ordinary Tin which they call <HI>Ca|lin,</HI> or with Tiles varni&s;hed with yellow, as it is in the King of <HI>China</HI>'s Palace. But tho there appears not any Gold in the Palace of <HI>Siam</HI> on the out&s;ide, and there is but little gilding on the in&s;ide, yet they fail not to call it <HI>Pra&s;&s;at-Tong,</HI> or the Golden Palace, becau&s;e they give pompous names to every thing which they honour. As for what concerns the five Orders of Architecture, compo&s;ed of Columns, Architraves, Frizes, and other Ornaments, the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have not any knowledge thereof; and it is not in Ornaments of Architecture, that among&s;t them con&s;i&s;ts the real Dignity of the Royal Hou&s;es and the Temples.</P>
<P>Their Stairs are &s;o mean, that a pair of Stairs of ten or twelve &s;teps,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stairs and Gates.</NOTE> by which we went up into the Hall of Audience at <HI>Siam,</HI> exceeded not two foot in breadth. They were of Brick joyning to the Wall on the right &s;ide, and with|out any Rail on the left. But the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Lords minded it not; they went up crawling on their Hands and Knees; and &s;o &s;oftly, that they might have &s;aid that they would &s;urprize the King their Ma&s;ter. The Gate of the Hall being &s;quare, but low and &s;trait, was agreeable to the Stairs, and placed on the left

Hand at the Extremity or Corner of the Wall of the Hall. I know not whether they under&s;tand &s;ubtilty, and whether they do not believe that a very little Door is too big, &s;eeing it is thought that they ought to pro&s;trate them&s;elves to enter therein. 'Tis true that the entrance into the Hall of <HI>Louvo</HI> is better, ac|cording to our Fancy; but be&s;ides that, the Palace of <HI>Louvo</HI> is more modern, the Prince does there lay a&s;ide his State, which re&s;ides principally in the Metropolis, as I &s;hall relate in the &s;equel.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherein the dignity of Pa|laces con&s;i&s;t.</NOTE>That which among&s;t them makes the real dignity of the Hou&s;es, is that altho there is no more than one &s;tory, yet they are not all level. As for example, in the Palace, the King and Lady's Apartment is higher than the re&s;t, and the nearer an Apartment is to it, the higher it is in re&s;pect to another, which is further di&s;tant: So that there is always &s;ome &s;teps to a&s;cend from one to the other: For they all joyn to one another, and the whole is from end to end on a line; and it is that which cau&s;es the inequality in the Roofs. The Roofs are all high|ridged, but the one is lower than the other; as it covers a part lower than ano|ther. And a lower Roof &s;eems to come out from a higher Roof, and the high|e&s;t to bear on the lowe&s;t, like a Saddle, the fore-bow of which bears on the hind part of another.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame at <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>In the King of <HI>China</HI>'s Palace it is the &s;ame: And this inequality of the Roofs, which &s;eems to proceed one from under another, after the manner that I have explain'd it, denotes grandeur, in that it &s;uppo&s;es an inequality of parts, which is not found in the&s;e Countries, at lea&s;t in con&s;iderable number, but at the King's Hou&s;es; to the end that the further one is permitted to go into this &s;et of Build|ings, the more indeed he a&s;cends, and the greater di&s;tinction he perceives. The great Officers will have three parts, one higher than another, which are divided by three Roofs of different elevation: But at the Palace of the City of <HI>Siam</HI> I have &s;een &s;even Roofs proceeding one from under another before the Building: I know not whether there were not others behind. Some &s;quare Towers, which are in the Palace, do &s;eem al&s;o to have &s;everal Roofs, one three, another five, another &s;even, as if they were &s;quare Goblets laid one upon another; and in one of the&s;e Towers is a very great Drum headed with an Elephants Skin, to beat the <HI>Toc&s;in</HI> or Alarum in ca&s;e of need.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame in the Temples or Pagodes.</NOTE>As to the <HI>Pagodes,</HI> in tho&s;e that I have &s;een, I ob&s;erved only one &s;ingle Pent-hou&s;e before, and another behind. The highe&s;t Roof is that under which the Idol &s;tands, the other two which are lower, are thought to be only for the People; although the People forbear not to enter every where on the days when the Temple is open.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pyramids.</NOTE>But the Principal Ornament of the Pagodes, is to be accompanied, as gene|rally they are, with &s;everal Pyramids of Lime and Brick, the Ornaments of which are very gro&s;ly performed. The highe&s;t are as high as our ordinary Stee|ples, and the lowe&s;t not exceeding two Fathom. They are all round, and do little dimini&s;h in bigne&s;s as they ri&s;e; &s;o that they terminate like a Dome: It is true that when they are very low, there proceeds from this Dome-like extremity a Tin Spire very &s;mall and &s;harp pointed, and high enough in relation to the re&s;t of the Pyramid. Some there are which dimini&s;h and grow thick again four or five times in their heighth, &s;o that the Profile of them goes waving: But the&s;e Bellyings out are &s;maller as they are in a higher part of the Pyramid. They are adorn'd in three or four places of their Contour, with &s;everal Furrows or Flutings at Right Angles, as well as in that they have &s;ome hollow, as in that they have &s;ome rai&s;ed, which dimini&s;hing gradually in proportion to the Dimi|nution of the Pyramid, do run terminating in a point at the beginning of the next bellying out, from whence do again ari&s;e new Flutings.</P>

&s;ides of this Hall lyes a Terra&s;s, which commands as well over the Garden which environs it, as it is commanded by the Hall; and it is on this Terra&s;s, and under a Canopy, purpo&s;ely erected on the North-&s;ide, that the King's Am|ba&s;&s;adors were at a private Audience, which the King of <HI>Siam</HI> gave them; and this Prince was in a Chair of State at one of the Hall Windows. In the mid|dle of the Garden and in the Courts there are &s;ome &s;ingle open Rooms, which are called Halls; I mean tho&s;e &s;quare places, that I have already de&s;cribed, which inclo&s;ed with a Wall, no higher than one may lean over, and cover'd with a Roof, which bears only upon Pillars placed at equal di&s;tances in the Wall. The&s;e Halls are for the chief <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who do there &s;it cro&s;s-legg'd, either for the Functions of their Offices, or to make their Court, or to expect the Prince's Orders, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Morning very late, and in the Evening until the approach of the Night, and they &s;tir not thence without Order.

<P>When we din'd in the Palace of <HI>Siam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The places of the Palace where we di|ned.</NOTE> 'twas in a very plea&s;ant place under great Trees, and at the &s;ide of a &s;tore-pond, wherein it was &s;aid that among&s;t &s;everal &s;orts of Fi&s;h there are &s;ome which re&s;emble a Man and Woman; but I &s;aw none of any &s;ort. In the Palace of <HI>Louvo</HI> we dined in the Garden, in a &s;ingle Hall, the Walls of which &s;upported the Roof. They are plai&s;tered with a Ci|ment extremely white, &s;mooth, and &s;hining, upon occa&s;ion of which it was told us there was much better made at <HI>Suratt.</HI> The Hall has a Door at each end, and is encompa&s;t with a Ditch between two or three Fathoms in breadth, and perhaps one in depth, in which there are twenty little <HI>Jet-deaus,</HI> at equal di&s;tances. They play like a watering pot, pierced with &s;everal very little holes, and they &s;purt no higher than the edge of the Ditch, or thereabouts, becau&s;e that in&s;tead of rai&s;ing the Water, they have dug away the Earth to make the Ba|&s;ons low.</P>
<P>The Garden is not very &s;pacious:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Garden of <HI>Louvo.</HI></NOTE> the Compartments and Borders thereof are very little and formed by Bricks laid edgeways. The Paths between the Borders cannot contain two a bre&s;t, nor the Walks more: But the whole being planted with Flowers, and &s;everal &s;orts of Palmites and other Trees, the Gar|den, Hall, and Fountains, had I know not what Air of Simplicity and Cool|ne&s;s, which cau&s;ed Delight. 'Tis a remarkable thing that the&s;e Princes &s;hould never be inclined to u&s;e Magnificence in their Gardens; altho from all Antiqui|ty the Orientals have admired them.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> exerci&s;ing the Chace &s;ometimes for &s;everal days,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Palaces of Bambou in the Woods.</NOTE> there are in the Woods &s;ome Palaces of Bambou, or if you plea&s;e, &s;ome fixed Tents, which only need furni&s;hing to receive him. They are red on the out&s;ide, like tho&s;e of the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> when he goes into the Country, and like the Walls which &s;erve as an Inclo&s;ure for the King of <HI>China</HI>'s Palace. I have given the Mo|del thereof, not only that the Simplicity of it may be &s;een, but principally be|cau&s;e &s;ome a&s;&s;ur'd me that the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Apartments, in his Palaces of <HI>Si|am</HI> and <HI>Louvo</HI> is according to the &s;ame Model. 'Tis only a little Dormitory, where the King and his Wives have each a little Cell: Neverthele&s;s the truth of what few per&s;ons do &s;ee, is always hard to know. However &s;ome al&s;o a&s;&s;ur'd me concerning this Prince, what I have heard reported of <HI>Cromwel,</HI> which is that for fear of being &s;urprized by any Con&s;piracy, this Prince hath &s;everal A|partments wherein he locks him&s;elf at night, it being impo&s;&s;ible to divine exact|ly in which he lyes. <HI>Strabo</HI> reports of the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings in his time, that this ve|ry rea&s;on obliged them to change their Bed and Apartment &s;everal times in the &s;ame Night.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their gro&s;s Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff.</NOTE>THeir Bed&s;tead is a wooden Frame very &s;trait and matted, but without Head or Po&s;ts. It has &s;ometimes &s;ix Feet, which are not joined by cro&s;s pieces, &s;ometimes it has none at all; but the generality have no other Bed than a Matt of Bulru&s;h. Their Table is like a Drum-head with the Edges rai&s;ed, and without Feet. They have at Table neither Cloth nor Napkin, nor Spoon, nor Fork, nor Knife, they are &s;erv'd with Mor&s;els ready cut. No Seats, but Bulru&s;h Matts, finer or cour&s;er: No Carpets, when the Prince gives them not to them: And tho&s;e of fine Cloth are very honourable, by rea&s;on of the dearne&s;s thereof. The Rich have Cu&s;hions to lean on, but they u&s;e them not to &s;it on, not the King him&s;elf. That which among&s;t us is of Stuff or Wooll, or Silk, is generally among&s;t them of white or painted Cotton.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ve&s;&s;els.</NOTE>Their Ve&s;&s;els are either of Porcelane, or Potter's Clay, with &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els of Copper. Wood plain, or varni&s;h'd, <HI>Coco</HI> and <HI>Bambou</HI> afford them all the re&s;t If they have any Ve&s;&s;el of Gold or Silver, 'tis very little, and almo&s;t only by the Liberality of the Prince, and as a Chattel belonging to their Offices. Their Buckets to draw up Water are of <HI>Bambou,</HI> very neatly woven. In the Markets the People are &s;een to boil their <HI>Rice</HI> in a <HI>Coco,</HI> and the <HI>Rice</HI> to be &s;ufficiently dre&s;t, before the <HI>Coco</HI> begins to burn; but the <HI>Coco</HI> &s;erves no more than once.</P>

'Tis not that every par|ticular per&s;on has &s;o many, but perhaps none has more. They do there add the names of the principal parts of a Hou&s;e, of their Habits, and of their Arms.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Furniture.</NOTE>Their King's Furniture is almo&s;t the &s;ame, but richer and more precious than tho&s;e of particular per&s;ons. The Halls, which I &s;aw at the Palaces of <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Louvo,</HI> are all Wain&s;coted, and the Wain&s;cot is varni&s;h'd Red, with &s;ome &s;treaks and foliages of Gold. The Floors were cover'd with Carpets. The Hall of Audience at <HI>Louvo</HI> was all over embelli&s;h'd with Looking-gla&s;&s;es, which the King's Squadron had brought to <HI>Siam.</HI> The Council-Chamber was furni&s;h'd after this manner. In the Room there was a Sopha made exactly like a great Bed&s;tead with its Po&s;ts, its Bottom and its Curtain-Rods all cover'd with a Plate of Gold, and the bottom with a Carpet, but without Te&s;ter or Curtains, or any &s;ort of Garniture; in&s;tead of the Bol&s;ter there were Cu&s;hions pil'd, on which the King lean'd, but &s;at not thereon, as I have already remark'd, he had only a Carpet under him. In this Hall, at the Wall of the right &s;ide in relation to the Sopha, there was an excellent Gla&s;s which the King had &s;ent to the King of <HI>Siam</HI> by <HI>M. de Chaumont.</HI> There was likewi&s;e a wooden Chair of State gilded, in which this Prince &s;hew'd him&s;elf to the King's Amba&s;&s;adors at a private Au|dience, which I have mention'd; and a <HI>Tiab</HI> or Cup to put <HI>Betel</HI> in, about two Foot high, or thereabouts, and cas'd with Silver curiou&s;ly wrought, and gilded in &s;ome places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Table-Plate which we &s;aw at the King's Palace.</NOTE>In all the Entertainments which we receiv'd at the Palace, we &s;aw great &s;tore of Silver Plate, e&s;pecially great Ba&s;ons round and deep, with a Brim about a Fin|ger's breadth, in which were &s;erv'd up great round Boxes about a Foot and an half in Diameter. They were cover'd, and had a Foot proportion'd to their bigne&s;s, and 'twas in the&s;e Boxes that the <HI>Rice</HI> was &s;erv'd up.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Concerning the Table of the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Table of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> is not &s;umptuous:<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> eat little, and what their Food is.</NOTE> As we eat le&s;s in Summer than in Winter, they eat le&s;s than we, by rea&s;on of the continual Summer in which they live; their common Food is Rice and Fi&s;h. The Sea affords them very delicate &s;mall Oy&s;ters, very excellent &s;mall Turtles, Lob&s;ters of all &s;izes, and admirable Fi&s;h, the &s;orts of which are unknown to us. Their River is al&s;o very plentiful of Fi&s;h, and principally very good and curious Eels: But they make little e&s;teem of fre&s;h Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Fre&s;h-water Fi&s;h, they have &s;ome little ones of two &s;orts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Wonder re|ported of two &s;orts of Fi&s;h.</NOTE> which do here de&s;erve to be mention'd. They call them <HI>Pla out,</HI> and <HI>Pla cadi,</HI> that is to &s;ay the Fi&s;h <HI>out,</HI> and the Fi&s;h <HI>cadi.</HI> To free me from all doubts, &s;ome have a&s;&s;ur'd me, that after they have &s;alted them together, as the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> us'd to do, if they leave them in an earthen Pot in their Pickle, where they &s;oon corrupt, by rea|&s;on they &s;alt ill at <HI>Siam,</HI> then, that is to &s;ay when they are corrupted, and as it were in a very liquid Pa&s;te, they do exactly follow the flux and reflux of the Sea, growing higher and lower in the Pitcher as the Sea ebbs or flows. Mr. <HI>Vin|cent</HI> gave me a Pot thereof at his arrival in <HI>France,</HI> and a&s;&s;ur'd me that this Ex|periment was true, and that he had &s;een it; but I cannot add my Te&s;timony thereunto, by rea&s;on I was too late adverti&s;ed thereof at <HI>Siam,</HI> to have an occa|&s;ion of a&s;certaining it by my own Eyes; and that the Pot which Mr. <HI>Vincent</HI> gave me, and which I brought to <HI>Paris,</HI> perform'd this Effect no more: perhaps becau&s;e the Fi&s;h were too much corrupted, or that their virtue of imitating the flux and reflux of the Sea continues only a certain time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> find much difficulty to make good Salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bad Salt at <HI>Siam:</HI> The de&s;ire of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> for corrupt meats.</NOTE> by rea&s;on that Meats do hardly take Salt in exce&s;&s;ive hot Countries; but they love Fi&s;h ill &s;ea&s;on'd and dry better than fre&s;h, even &s;tinking Fi&s;h di&s;plea&s;eth them not no more than rotten Eggs, Locu&s;ts, Rats, Lizards, and mo&s;t In&s;ects: Nature doubtle&s;s framing their Appetite to things, the Dige&s;tion whereof is more ea&s;ie to them.

'Tis certain that at <HI>Siam</HI> new-laid Eggs are very unwhol&s;om; we do here eat Vipers, we draw not certain Birds to eat them; and &s;ometimes Veni&s;on a little over-hunted is be&s;t reli&s;ht.</P>
<P>A <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> makes a very good Meal with a pound of <HI>Rice</HI> a day,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What a <HI>Sia|me&s;e</HI> expends a day in Food.</NOTE> which amounts not to more than a Farthing; and with a little dry or &s;alt Fi&s;h, which co&s;ts not more.

<P>Their Sauces are plain, a little Water with &s;ome Spices, Garlic, Chibols,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Sauces.</NOTE> or &s;ome &s;weet Herb, as Baulm. They do very much e&s;teem a liquid Sauce, like Mu&s;tard, which is only Cray-Fi&s;h corrupted, becau&s;e they are ill &s;alted; they call it <HI>Capi.</HI> They gave Mr. <HI>Ceberet</HI> &s;ome Pots thereof, which had no bad Smell.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Oil they eat.</NOTE>They have neither Nuts, nor Olives, nor any eating Oil, &s;ave that which they extract from the Fruit of <HI>Coco;</HI> which, tho always a little bitter, yet is good, when it is fre&s;h drawn: but it pre&s;ently becomes very &s;trong, in&s;omuch that it is not eatable by &s;uch as are not accu&s;tomed to eat bad Oil. The Ta&s;te is al|ways made, and it happened at my return from a very long Voyage, where I met with no extraordinary Oil, that I found the excellent Oil of <HI>Paris</HI> in&s;ipid and ta&s;tele&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How Rela|tions mu&s;t be under&s;tood with reference to him that writes them.</NOTE>Wherefore I cannot forbear making a remark very nece&s;&s;ary, truly to under|&s;tand the Relations of Foreign Countries.

As for ex|ample, if a <HI>Dutch</HI> Factor, or a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Monk do exaggerate the Magnificence, and good Entertainment of the Ea&s;t; if the lea&s;t Hou&s;e of the King of <HI>China</HI>'s Palace appears unto them worthy of an <HI>European</HI> King, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that this is true, in reference to the Court of <HI>Portugal.</HI> And yet &s;ome may doubt hereof, &s;eeing that in truth the Apartments of the Palace of <HI>China,</HI> are no other than Wood varni&s;hed on the in&s;ide and out&s;ide, which is rather agree|able and neat than magnificent. Thus (becau&s;e it would not be ju&s;t to contemn every thing, that re&s;embles not what we do now &s;ee in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and which was never &s;een before this great and glorious Reign) I have endeavour'd to expre&s;s nothing in ambiguous Terms, but to de&s;cribe exactly what I have &s;een, thereby to prevent the &s;urpri&s;ing any per&s;on by my particular Fancy, and to the end that every one make as true a Judgment of what I write, as if he had performed the Voyage that I have done.</P>

As for in&s;tance, among&s;t the King of <HI>China</HI>'s Wives, there is only one that hath the Honours and Title of Queen: the re&s;t are under her, although they be all legi|timate, that is to &s;ay permitted by the Laws of the Country. They are called <HI>verbatim</HI> the <HI>Ladies of the Palace,</HI> and at <HI>Siam</HI> they have the &s;ame Name. The Children of the&s;e Ladies honour not their natural Mothers, as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are obliged theirs, but they render this Re&s;pect, and give the Name of Mother to the Queen; as if the &s;econd Wives bore Children only for the principal Wife. And this is al&s;o the Cu&s;tom at <HI>China,</HI> in the Hou&s;es of private Per&s;ons, who have &s;everal Wives; to the end that there may be an entire &s;ubordination, which maintains Peace there as much as po&s;&s;ible. And that the Children be not permit|ted to di&s;pute among&s;t them the merit of their Mothers. We read almo&s;t the &s;ame thing of <HI>Sarah,</HI> who gave <HI>Hagar</HI> her Bond-maid unto <HI>Abraham,</HI> to have, as &s;he &s;aid, &s;ome Children by her Slave, being pa&s;t Child-bearing her &s;elf. Some other Wives of the Patriarchs practi&s;ed the &s;ame, and it is evident that being the principal Wives, every one was thought the Mother of all her Husband's Chil|dren. But to return to what I have &s;poken concerning the danger of being de|ceived by the Tran&s;lations of the Foreign words in Relations, who &s;ees not the Equivocation of the&s;e words, <HI>the Ladies of the Palace,</HI> put into the mouth of a <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> or in the mouth of a <HI>French-man,</HI> who tran&s;lates a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Relation of <HI>China?</HI> The &s;ame Equivocations are found in the names of Offices? Becau&s;e that all Courts and all Governments do not re&s;emble. All Functions are not found every where, and the &s;ame are not every where attri|buted to the &s;ame Offices, that is to &s;ay to Offices of the &s;ame name: be&s;ides that &s;uch a Function will be great and con&s;iderable in one Country, which may be incon&s;iderable in another. As for example, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have Mar&s;hals, which they at fir&s;t de&s;ign'd in imitation of the Mar&s;hals of <HI>France,</HI> and yet an Amba&s;&s;ador would find him&s;elf exceedingly mi&s;taken, if being accompanied to the Audience of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> by a Mar&s;hal of <HI>Spain,</HI> he &s;hould think him|&s;elf
<PB N="37" REF="27">
as highly honoured, as if he were accompany'd to the King's Audience by a Mar&s;hal of <HI>France.</HI> Now the more remote the Courts are, the greater is the defect, when the &s;ame Words and the &s;ame <HI>Idea's</HI> are transferred from the one to the other. At <HI>Siam</HI> it is a very honourable Employment to empty the King's Clo&s;e-&s;tool, which is always emptied in a place appointed, and carefully kept for this purpo&s;e; it may be out of &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious Fear of the Sorceries which they imagine may be perform'd on the Excrements. At <HI>China</HI> all the Splendor and Authority is in the Offices which we call the Long Robe: And their Military Officers, at lea&s;t before the Domination of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ted only of unfortunate Wretches, who were not thought endow'd with Merit &s;ufficient to rai&s;e them&s;elves by Learning.</P>
<P>A third defect of Relations is to de&s;cribe things only in one Particular,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Re|flection on the &s;ame Subject.</NOTE> if I may &s;o &s;ay. The Reader conceives that in every thing el&s;e the Nation whereof he is inform'd re&s;embles his, and that in this only it is either ex|travagant or admirable. Thus if it be &s;imply &s;aid, that the King of <HI>Si|am</HI> puts his Shirt over his Ve&s;t, this would appear ridiculous to us; but when the whole is under&s;tood, it is found, that, tho' all Nations act al|mo&s;t on different Principles, the whole amounts almo&s;t to the &s;ame; and that there is not in any place any thing marvellous or extravagant. But enough is &s;poken on this Subject, I return to the good Cheer of the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>They have Milk from the Female <HI>Buffalo,</HI> which has more Cream,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Milk at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> than the Milk of our Cows; but they make not any &s;ort of Chee&s;e, and &s;carce any Butter.

Heretofore in <HI>Europe</HI> &s;everal Sugar Figures were &s;erv'd up among&s;t the Fruit, but they eat them not; and the <HI>Germans</HI> call'd them <HI>Schaw-e&s;&s;en,</HI> or <HI>Food to look upon.</HI></P>

The one <HI>Pagayes</HI> at the right, and the other on the left &s;ide. <HI>Pagayer</HI> is to row with the <HI>Pagaye,</HI> and the <HI>Pagaye</HI> is a &s;hort Oar, which one holds with both hands, by the middle, and at the end. It &s;eems that he can only &s;weep the water though with force. It is not fixed to the edge of the <HI>Balon,</HI> and he that manages it, looks where he goes; whereas he that rows, turns his back to his Road.</P>
<P>In a &s;ingle <HI>Balon</HI> there are &s;ometimes an hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An exact De|&s;cription of a <HI>Balon.</HI></NOTE> or an hundred and twenty <HI>Pagayeurs,</HI> thus ranged two and two with their Legs cro&s;&s;ed on Plancks: but the inferior Officers have <HI>Balons</HI> a great deal &s;horter, where few <HI>Pagayes</HI> or <HI>Oars,</HI> as &s;ixteen, or twenty do &s;uffice. The <HI>Pagayeurs</HI> or Rowers, do &s;trike the <HI>Pagaye</HI> in Con&s;ort, do &s;ing, or make &s;ome mea&s;ured Noi&s;es; and they plunge the <HI>Pagaye</HI> in a ju&s;t cadence with a motion of the Arms and Shoulders, which is vigorous, but ea&s;y, and graceful. The weight of this Bank of Oars &s;erves as Balla&s;t to the <HI>Balon,</HI> and keeps it almo&s;t even with the water, which is the rea&s;on that the <HI>Pagayes</HI> are very &s;hort. And the Impre&s;&s;ion which the <HI>Balon</HI> receives from &s;o many men which vigorou&s;ly plunge the <HI>Pagaye</HI> at the &s;ame time, makes it al|ways totter with a motion which plea&s;es the Eye, and which is ob&s;erv'd much more at the Poop and Prow; becau&s;e they are higher, and like to the Neck and Tail of &s;ome of Dragon, or &s;ome mon&s;trous Fi&s;h, of which the <HI>Pagayes</HI> on ei|ther &s;ide &s;hew like the Wings or the Fins. At the Prow one &s;ingle <HI>Pagayeur</HI> takes up the fir&s;t Rank, without having any Comrade at his &s;ide. He has not room enough to cro&s;s his left Leg with his right, and he is forced to &s;tretch it out over an end of a &s;tick, which proceeds from the &s;ide of the Prow. 'Tis this fir&s;t <HI>Pa|gayeur</HI> that gives the motion to all the re&s;t. His <HI>Pagaye</HI> is &s;omewhat longer, by rea&s;on that he is po&s;ted in that place where the Prow begins to ri&s;e, and that he is &s;o much the further from the Water. He plunges the <HI>Pagaye</HI> once to every mea&s;ure, and when it is nece&s;&s;ary to go &s;wifter he plunges it twice; and lifting up the <HI>Pagaye</HI> continually, and only for decency with a &s;hout, he throws the water a great way, and the next &s;troak all the Equipage imitates him. The Pi|lot &s;tands always at the Poop, where it ri&s;es exceedingly. The Rudder is a ve|ry long <HI>Pagaye,</HI> which is not fixed to the <HI>Balon,</HI> and to which the Steer&s;man &s;eems to give no other Motion, than to keep it truly perpendicular in the wa|ter, and again&s;t the edge of the <HI>Balon</HI> &s;ometimes on the right &s;ide, and &s;ome|times on the left. The Women Slaves do row the Ladies <HI>Balons.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>Balons</HI> of ordinary &s;ervice, wherein there are fewer <HI>Pagayeurs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several &s;orts of <HI>Balons.</HI></NOTE> there is in the middle a Cabin of <HI>Bambou,</HI> or other Wood, without Painting or Var|ni&s;h, in which a whole Family may be held, and &s;ometimes this Cabin has a lower Pent-hou&s;e be fore, under which the Slaves are; and many of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have no other Habitation. But in the <HI>Balons</HI> of Ceremony, or in tho&s;e of the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s body, which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have called <HI>Balons of State,</HI> there is in the middle but one Seat, which takes up almo&s;t the whole breadth of the <HI>Balon,</HI> and wherein there is only one Per&s;on and his Arms, the Sabre and Lance. If it is an ordinary <HI>Mandarin,</HI> he has only a &s;ingle Umbrella like ours to &s;helter him|&s;elf; if it is a more con&s;iderable <HI>Mandarin,</HI> be&s;ides that his Seat is higher, he is covered with what the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> call <HI>Chirole,</HI> and the <HI>Siame&s;es Coup.</HI> 'Tis an Arbor all open before and behind, made of <HI>Bambous</HI> cleft and interlac'd, and co|ver'd within and without with a black or red Varni&s;h.

<P>Whil&s;t the King of <HI>Siam</HI> is in his Metropolis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">When and how the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf.</NOTE> the ancient cu&s;tom of his Court requires that he &s;how him&s;elf to the people five or &s;ix days of the year only, and that he does it with Pomp. Heretofore the Kings his Predece&s;&s;ors did fir&s;t break up the ground every year, till they left this Function to the <HI>Oc-ya-kaou;</HI> and it was attended with great Splendor. They al&s;o went out another day to perform on the water another Ceremony, which was not le&s;s &s;uper&s;titious, nor le&s;s &s;plen|did. 'Twas to conjure the River to return into its Channel, when the Agricul|ture requir'd it, and when the Wind inclining to the North a&s;&s;ured the return of fair weather. The pre&s;ent King was the fir&s;t that di&s;penc'd with this trou|ble&s;om work, and it is &s;everal years &s;ince it &s;eem'd aboli&s;hed; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, that the la&s;t time he perform'd it, he had the di&s;grace of being &s;urpriz'd with rain, altho his A&s;trologers had promi&s;ed him a fair day.</P>
<P><HI>Ferdinand Mendez Pinto,</HI> relates that in his time the King of <HI>Siam</HI> u&s;ed to &s;hew him&s;elf one day in a year upon his white Elephant, to ride through nine &s;treets of the City, and to extend great Liberalities to the People. This Ceremony, if it has been in u&s;e, is now aboli&s;hed. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> never mounts the white Elephant, and the rea&s;on which they give is, that the white Elephant is as great a Lord as him&s;elf, becau&s;e he has a King's &s;oul like him. Thus this Prince &s;hews him&s;elf in his Metropolis no more than twice a year, at the beginning of the &s;ixth and twelfth month, to go and pre&s;ent Alms of Silver, yellow <HI>Pagnes</HI>&mdash;, and fruits to the <HI>Talapoins</HI> of the Principal Pagods. On the&s;e days, which the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Van pra, a holy, or excellent day,</HI> he goes upon an Elephant to the Pa|godes which are in the &s;ame City, and by water to another, which is about two leagues from the City down the River. On the days following he &s;ends the like Alms to the le&s;s con&s;iderable Pagods: but this extends not above two leagues from the Metropolis, or thereabouts. And in the la&s;t month of the year 1687, this Prince went no where in per&s;on; he contented him&s;elf with &s;ending every where.</P>
<P>If therefore the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf in his Metropolis, 'tis upon &s;ome Ceremonies of Religion, At <HI>Louvo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Siam</HI> lives with le&s;s pomp at <HI>Louvo</HI> than at <HI>Sam</HI></NOTE> where it is permitted him to lay a&s;ide his King&s;hip, he frequently goes abroad, either for the hunting of the Tyger and Ele|phant, or to &s;tir him&s;elf; he goes with &s;o little Pomp, that when he marches from <HI>Louvo</HI> to his little hou&s;e of <HI>Thlee-pou&s;&s;one</HI> with his Ladies, he gives not any carriage to the women which are of the Company: which is doubtle&s;s a re&s;pect from the&s;e women Slaves to their Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>

not render to their Ma&s;ter all the other re&s;pects which are due unto him, and which in the&s;e Countries we found very in&s;upportable.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The way of catching a wild Ele|phant.</NOTE>THE place, where the Elephant is that they would take, is as it were a very broad and very long Trench: I &s;ay, as it were a Trench, becau&s;e it is not made by digging, but by rai&s;ing the Earth almo&s;t perpendicular on each &s;ide, and it is upon the&s;e Terra&s;&s;es that the Spectators &s;tand. In the bottom, which is between the&s;e Terra&s;&s;es, is a double row of Trunks of Trees above ten Foot high, planted in the Earth, big enough to re&s;i&s;t the Attacks of the Ele|phant, and far enough from one another to let a Man pa&s;s between, but too clo&s;e to let an Elephant pa&s;s through. 'Tis between the&s;e two rows of Trunks, that the tame Female Elephants, which they had led into the Woods, had en|ticed a wild Male Elephant. Tho&s;e which guide them thither, do cover them|&s;elves with Leaves, to avoid frighting the Elephants of the Woods, and the Female Elephants have under&s;tanding enough, to make the Cries proper to call the Males. He was already intrap'd in the double row of Trunks, by follow|ing the Females, and could no more return into the Woods; but the de&s;ign was to take him and tie him, to &s;hut him up and tame him. The Egre&s;s from the &s;pace wherein he was, is a &s;trait <HI>Cortina,</HI> compo&s;ed al&s;o of great Trunks of
<PB N="45" REF="32">
Trees. So &s;oon as the Elephant is enter'd into this Cortine, the Gate through which he enters, and which he opens by thru&s;ting it before him with his <HI>Pro|bo&s;cis,</HI> &s;huts again with its own weight: the other Gate through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s is &s;hut; and be&s;ides the &s;pace is &s;o narrow, that he cannot turn him&s;elf therein. The difficulty was to engage the wild Elephant in this Cortine, and to engage him &s;ingle; for the Females were &s;till with him in the Trench, and he did not &s;eparate from them. Several <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> who &s;tood behind the Palli|&s;ado's of the Trunks, and the Foot of the Terra&s;&s;es, where the Elephant could not come at them, enter'd every where between the Trunks into the &s;pace, where the Elephant was, to vex him; and when the Elephant pur&s;ued one of them, he fled very &s;wiftly behind the Palli&s;ado's, between which the enraged Elephant vainly thru&s;t his <HI>Probo&s;cis,</HI> and again&s;t which he broke the end of one of his Teeth. Whil&s;t he thus pur&s;ued after tho&s;e which provoked him, others laid long Noo&s;es for him. One of the ends of which they kept; and they threw them at him with &s;o much dexterity, that the Elephant in running never fail'd to put one of his hind-feet therein: &s;o that by diligently putting the end of the Noo&s;e, they clos'd and fa&s;ten'd it a little above the Elephant's foot, The&s;e Noo&s;es were of great Ropes, one of the ends of which was put into the other like a Slip-knot, and the Elephant dragged three or four of them at each hind-foot. For as &s;oon as the Noo&s;e is once knit, he lets go the end thereof, to avoid being drag'd him&s;elf by the Elephant. The more he is exa&s;perated, the le&s;s he a&s;&s;ociates with the Females; and yet to make them quit this &s;pace, a Man mounted on another Female enter'd therein, and went back again &s;eve|ral times through the Cortine, and this Female which he mounted, called the others, by a dry blow, which &s;he &s;truck again&s;t the ground with her <HI>Probo&s;cis.</HI> She darted it perpendicularly downwards, yet avoiding to &s;trike altogether with the end, which &s;he kept bended upwards. And when &s;he had repeated this Call twice or thrice, he that rid her, made her to return back again through the Cortine. In fine, after he had perform'd this Trick five or &s;ix times with this Female, the other Female follow'd her, and &s;oon after the Elephant return'd to him&s;elf, becau&s;e they forbore to vex him, re&s;olv'd to go after them. He pu&s;h'd open the fir&s;t door of the Cortine with his <HI>Probo&s;cis,</HI> and &s;o &s;oon as he was en|ter'd, they threw &s;everal Buckets of water on his Body to refre&s;h him, and with an incredible &s;wiftne&s;s and dexterity they ty'd him to the Trunks of the Cor|tine with the Noo&s;es, which were already at his feet. Then they made a tame Elephant to enter backwards into the Cortine, to who&s;e Neck they al&s;o ty'd the &s;avage Elephant by the Neck, and at the &s;ame time unloos'd him from the Trunks; and two other tame Elephants being likewi&s;e led to the Succor, all the three, the one on one &s;ide, the other on the other, and the third behind, do conduct the wild Elephant under a Pent-hou&s;e near adjoining, where they fa&s;ten and tie him clo&s;e by the Neck to a Pivot planted upright, which he made to turn as he turn'd round. They &s;aid that he need remain at this Pivot but 24 hours, and that in this &s;pace of time they would lead &s;ome tame Elephants to him to keep him company, and comfort him: that after 24 hours they would carry him into the Stable appointed for him; and that in eight days he would bethink him&s;elf, and &s;ubmit to Slavery.</P>
<P>They &s;peak of an Elephant as of a Man;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> do think of the Ele|phants.</NOTE> they believe him perfectly ratio|nal, and they relate &s;uch rational things of him, that he only wants Speech. This is one, for Example, to which you may give what Credit you plea&s;e. Some have related to us for a known Truth, that a Man having crack'd a <HI>Coco</HI> on the head of an Elephant which he rode, and u&s;ing for this purpo&s;e the back of that kind of Punch, with which I have &s;aid that they guide the Elephants, this Elephant took up a re&s;olution of revenging him&s;elf as &s;oon as he could. He gather'd up with his <HI>Probo&s;cis,</HI> as they &s;ay, one of the Shells of the <HI>Coco,</HI> and kept it &s;everal days, never letting it go but to eat, during which he kept it carefully between his two fore-feet. In fine, he that had affronted him, approaching him to give him food, the Elephant &s;eiz'd him, trampled him under his feet, and &s;lew him, and for his Ju&s;tification laid the <HI>Coco</HI>-Shell on the dead Body. 'Tis in the&s;e terms that the Relation was made to us: for the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do think that

Elephants are capable of Ju&s;tice, and of profiting by the puni&s;hments one of another; and they alledge that in War, for In&s;tance, when the&s;e Animals muti|ny, it is needful only to kill one on the &s;pot, to render all the others wi&s;e. But the&s;e Relations, and &s;everal others, which I have forgot, do &s;eem very fabulous; and not to digre&s;s from the Example, which I have mentioned, it is, in my opi|nion, very evident, that if the offended Elephant had con&s;ulted rea&s;on, he would not have waited another opportunity of revenge, but would have wreak'd his vengeance on the &s;pot; &s;eeing that every Elephant can with his <HI>Probo&s;cis</HI> throw off the Rider, and having thrown him on the ground, trample him under foot, and kill him.</P>

They &s;ay that an Elephant having been puni&s;h'd after this manner, and being &s;et at liberty, returns to his Lodge at the Palace, and kills the Elephant which was put in his place; which &s;eems neither incredible nor &s;trange, provi|ded the way be free and open: for every Animal loves his u&s;ual Lodging, and according as he is more or le&s;s Couragious, he will u&s;e more or le&s;s Violence to drive out another Animal.</P>

<P>The one was a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Comedy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Comedy.</NOTE> which I would willingly have &s;een to the end, but it was adjourned, after &s;ome Scenes, to go to Dinner.

On the contrary, another Actor, walking like a Madman, threw his Feet and Arms in &s;everal extravagant Po&s;tures, and after a threatning manner, but much more exce&s;&s;ive, than the whole Action of our Captains or Matamores. He was the General of an Army; and if the Rela|tions of <HI>China</HI> are true, this Actor naturally repre&s;ented the Affectations com|mon to the Soldiers of his Country.

They plant a <HI>Bambou</HI> in the ground, and to the end of this they join another, and to the end of this &s;econd a third, and to the end of the third a Hoop: &s;o that this makes as it were the wood of a round Racket, the Handle of which would be very long. A Man holding the two &s;ides of the Hoop with his two Hands, puts his Head upon the inferior and inward part of the Hoop, rai&s;es his Body and his Feet on high, and continues in this po&s;ture an hour, and &s;ometimes an hour and half: then he will put a Foot where he had plac'd his Head, and without &s;tanding otherwi&s;e, and without fixing the other Foot, he will dance after their manner, that is to &s;ay, without rai&s;ing him&s;elf, but only by making Contor&s;ions: And what renders all this more perilous and difficult, is the continual wavering of the <HI>Bambou.</HI> A <HI>Bambou</HI> dancer of this &s;ort, they call <HI>Lot Bouang; Lot</HI> &s;ignifies to <HI>pa&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Bouang</HI> a <HI>Hoop.</HI></P>

But what they account mo&s;t difficult, is to get upon this Wire by the part of that &s;ame Wire which is fa&s;ten'd to the ground, and to de&s;cend thence by one of the <HI>Bambou's,</HI> which are plac'd like a <HI>St. Andrew</HI>'s <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> to &s;upport it: as al&s;o to &s;it on the Wire cro&s;s-leg'd, to hold there one of tho&s;e Bands, which &s;erves them as a Table to eat on it, and to rai&s;e them&s;elves on their Feet.

Mo&s;t of their Masks are hideous, and repre&s;ent either mon&s;trous Bea&s;ts, or kinds of Devils. The Show which they call <HI>Lacone,</HI> is a Poem intermixt with Epic and Dramatic, which la&s;ts three days, from eight in the Morning till &s;even at Night. They are Hi&s;tories in Ver&s;e, &s;erious, and &s;ung by &s;everal Actors always pre&s;ent, and which do on|ly &s;ing reciprocally.

The <HI>Rabam</HI> is a double Dance of Men and Women, which is not Martial, but Gallant; and they pre&s;ented unto us the Diver&s;ion thereof with the others, which I have before mentioned. The&s;e Dancers, both Men and Women, have all fal&s;e Nails, and very long ones, of Copper: They &s;ing &s;ome words in their dancing, and they can perform it with|out much tyring them&s;elves, becau&s;e their way of dancing is a &s;imple march round, very &s;low, and without any high motion; but with a great many &s;low Contor&s;ions of the Body and Arms, &s;o they hold not one another. Mean while two Men entertain the Spectators with &s;everal Fooleries, which the one utters in the name of all the Men-dancers, and the other in the name of all the Women-dancers. All the&s;e Actors have nothing &s;ingular in their Habits: on|ly tho&s;e that dance in the <HI>Rabam,</HI> and <HI>Cone,</HI> have gilded Paper-Bonnets, high and pointed, like the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Caps of Ceremony, but which hang down at the &s;ides below their Ears, and which are adorned with counterfeit Stones, and with two Pendants of gilded wood. The <HI>Cone</HI> and the <HI>Rabam</HI> are always call'd at Funerals, and &s;ometimes on other occa&s;ions; and 'tis probable that the&s;e Shows contain nothing Religious, &s;ince the <HI>Talapoins</HI> are prohibited to be pre&s;ent there|at. The <HI>Lacone</HI> &s;erves principally to &s;olemnize the Fea&s;t of the Dedication of a new Temple, when a new Statue of their <HI>Sommona-Codam</HI> is plac'd therein.</P>
<P>This Fe&s;tival is likewi&s;e accompany'd with races of Oxen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wre&s;tling and Boxing.</NOTE> and &s;everal other Diver&s;ions, as of Wre&s;tlers, and Men that fight with their Elbow and Fi&s;t. In Boxing, they guard their Hand with three or four rounds of Cord in&s;tead of the Copper Rings, which tho&s;e of <HI>Laos</HI> do u&s;e in &s;uch Combats.</P>
<P>The Running of Oxen is perform'd in this manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Race of Oxen.</NOTE> They mark out a Plat of 500 Fathom in length, and two in breadth, with four Trunks, which are planted at the four Corners, to &s;erve as Boundaries; and it is round the&s;e Li|mits that the Cout&s;e is run. In the middle of this place they erect a Scaffold for the Judges: and the more preci&s;ely to mark out the middle, which is the place from whence the Oxen were to &s;tart, they do plant a very high Po&s;t again&s;t the Scaffold. Sometimes 'tis only a &s;ingle Ox which runs again&s;t ano|ther, the one and the other being guided by two Men running a foot, which do hold the Reins, or rather the String put into their No&s;es, the one on the one &s;ide, and the other on the other &s;ide; and other Men are po&s;ted at certain di|&s;tances, to ea&s;e tho&s;e which run. But mo&s;t frequently it is a Yoke of Oxen fa&s;ten'd to a Plough, which runs again&s;t another Yoke of Oxen joined to ano|ther Plough; &s;ome Men guide them on the right &s;ide and on the left, as when it is only a &s;ingle Ox which runs again&s;t another: But be&s;ides this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that each Plough be &s;o well &s;u&s;tained in the Air by a Man running, that it never touch the ground, for fear it retard the Animals that draw it; and the&s;e Men which thus &s;upport the Ploughs, are more frequently reliev'd than the others.

Now tho' the Ploughs run both after the &s;ame manner, turning always to the right round the &s;pace which I have de&s;cribed, they &s;et not out from the &s;ame place.

Thus at the beginning of their Cour&s;e they look from oppo&s;ite places, and they are di&s;tant one from the other half a Circle, or half the &s;pace over which they were to run. Yet they run after the &s;ame manner, as I have &s;aid, turning &s;everal times round the four Boundaries, which I have mentioned, till the one overtakes the other. The Spectators are neverthele&s;s all round, yet is it not nece&s;&s;ary to have Bars to hinder from ap|proaching too near. The&s;e Cour&s;es are &s;ometimes the &s;ubjects of Bettings, and the Lords do breed and train up &s;mall, but well-proportion'd Oxen for this Ex|erci&s;e; and in&s;tead of Oxen, they do likewi&s;e make u&s;e of <HI>Buffalo's.</HI></P>

And when they have &s;atisfy'd the Service of their King, and they are return'd home, the generality know not unto what bu&s;ine&s;s to apply them&s;elves, being little accu&s;tomed to any particu|lar Profe&s;&s;ion; by rea&s;on the Prince employs them indifferently to all, as it plea|&s;eth him.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Concerning the Marriage and Divorce of the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>'TIs not the Cu&s;tom in this Country to permit unto Maids the Conver&s;ation of young men. The Mothers cha&s;ti&s;e them, when they &s;urprize them &s;o:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The care they have of keep|ing their Daughters.</NOTE>
but the Girls forbear not to get out, when they can; and this is not impo&s;&s;ible towards the Evening.</P>
<P>They are capable of having children at twelve years of Age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">At what Age they marry them.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes &s;ooner; and the greate&s;t part have none pa&s;t forty. The Cu&s;tom is therefore to marry them very young, and the Boys in proportion. Yet there is found &s;ome <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI> who di&s;dain Marriage all their life, but there is not any that can turn <HI>Talapoine&s;&s;e,</HI> that is to &s;ay, con&s;ecrate her &s;elf to a Religious life, who is not ad|vanc'd in years.</P>
<P>When a Marriage is de&s;ign'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How a <HI>Sia|me&s;e</HI> &s;eeks a Maid in Mar|riage, and how their Marriage is concluded.</NOTE> the Parents of the young man demand the Maid of her Parents, by women advanced in years and of good Reputation. If the Parents of the Maid have any inclination thereunto, they return a favourable An&s;wer. Neverthele&s;s they re&s;erve unto them&s;elves the liberty of con&s;ulting fir&s;t the mind of their Daughter; and at the &s;ame time they take the hour of the young mans Nativity, and give that of the Birth of the Maid: and both &s;ides go to the South&s;ayers to know principally whether the Party propo&s;ed is rich, and whether the Marriage will continue till death without a divorce. As every one carefully conceals his riches, to &s;ecure them from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the Ma|gi&s;trate, and the Covetuou&s;ne&s;s of the Prince, it is nece&s;&s;aty that they go to the South&s;ayer, to know whether a Family is rich, and it is upon the advice of the South&s;ayers that they take their Re&s;olution. If the Marriage mu&s;t be concluded, the young man goes to vi&s;it the Lady three times, and carries her &s;ome pre&s;ents of <HI>Betel</HI> and Fruit, and nothing more precious. At the third Vi&s;it the Relations on both &s;ides appear there likewi&s;e, and they count the Portion of the Bride, and what is given to the Bridegroom to whom the whole is delivered upon the &s;pot, and in pre&s;ence of the Relations, but without any writing. The new married couple do al&s;o commonly receive on this occa&s;ion &s;ome pre&s;ents from their Uncles: and from that time, and without any Religious Ceremony, the Bridegroom has a right to con&s;ummate the Marriage. The <HI>Talapoins</HI> are pro|hibited to be pre&s;ent thereat. Only &s;ome days after they go to the hou&s;e of the New Married folks to &s;prinkle &s;ome Holy-water, and to repeat &s;ome Prayers in the <HI>Baly</HI>-Tongue.</P>
<P>The Wedding as in all other places, is attended with Fea&s;ts and &s;hows.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nuptial Fea&s;t.</NOTE> They do hire and invite profe&s;t Dancers thereunto; but neither the Bridegroom, nor the Bride, nor any of the Gue&s;ts do dance. The Fea&s;t is made at the hou&s;e of the Brides Relations, where the Bridegroom takes care to build an Hall on pur|po&s;e, which &s;tands alone: And from thence the new married per&s;ons are con|ducted into another &s;ingle Building, built al&s;o on purpo&s;e, at the expence and care of the Bridegroom, in the Inclo&s;ure of <HI>Bambou,</HI> which makes the Inclo&s;ure of the Hou&s;e of the Brides Relations. The new married per&s;ons continue there &s;ome Months, and then go to &s;ettle where it plea&s;es them be&s;t to build an Hou&s;e for them&s;elves. A &s;ingular Ornament for the Daughters of the <HI>Mandarins</HI> which are married, is to put on their head that Circle of Gold, which the <HI>Mandarins</HI> put on their Bonnet of Ceremony. Next to this the decking con&s;i&s;ts in having finer Pagnes then ordinary, more excellent Pendants, and more curious Rings on their Fingers, and in greater quantity. Some there are who report that the pretended father-in-Law, before the conclu&s;ion of the Marriage of his Daughter with his Son-in-Law, keeps him &s;ix Months in his hou&s;e, to know him better. Some ab&s;olutely deny that this is true. And all that, in my opi|nion, may have given occa&s;ion to the report, is that it belongs to the Bride|groom to build the Wedding Room, and Hou&s;e, which he is to have at his Fa|ther-in-Law's,
<PB N="52" REF="36">
during which, that is to &s;ay for two or three days at mo&s;t, his fu|ture Spou&s;e brings him Food, without dreading the Con&s;equences thereof, be|cau&s;e the Marriage is already concluded, altho' the Fea&s;t be deferred.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riches of the Mar|riages at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>The greate&s;t Portion at <HI>Siam</HI> is an hundred <HI>Catis,</HI> which do make 15000 Livres; and becau&s;e it is common that the Bridegroom's E&s;tate equals the Por|tion of the Bride, it follows that at <HI>Siam</HI> the greate&s;t Fortune of two new mar|ried Per&s;ons exceeds not 10000 Crowns.</P>

They are only purchas'd Wives, and con&s;equently Slaves; &s;o that the Children of the little Wives do call their Father <HI>Po Tchaou,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>Fa|ther Lord,</HI> whereas the Children of the principal Wife do call him &s;imply <HI>Po,</HI> or <HI>Father.</HI></P>

And as to the degrees of Alliance, a Man may marry two Si&s;ters one after the other, and not at the &s;ame time. Neverthele&s;s the Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> do di&s;pen&s;e with the&s;e Rules, and do think it hardly po&s;&s;ible to find a Wife worthy of them, but in per&s;ons that are nearly related to them. The pre&s;ent King married his Si&s;ter, and by this Marriage was born the Prin|ce&s;s his only Daughter, whom it is &s;aid he has married. I could not find out the truth, but this is the common Report: And I think it probable, in that her Hou&s;e is erected as unto a Queen; and the <HI>Europeans</HI> who have call'd her the Prince&s;s-Queen, have made the &s;ame judgment thereof with me. The Relations inform us, that in other places as well as at <HI>Siam,</HI> there are &s;ome Ex|amples of the&s;e Marriages of the Brother with the Si&s;ter; and it is certain that they have been anciently frequent among&s;t a great many <HI>Pagan</HI> Nations, at lea&s;t in the Royal Families: either to the end that the Daughter might &s;uc|ceed to the Crown with the Son, or out of the fear I have mention'd, that the&s;e Kings have had of mi&s;placing their Alliances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Thus <HI>Jupiter</HI> had married his Si&s;ter.</NOTE> if they married not their own Si&s;ters. For as to what others add, that it is to the end that the People may not doubt of having a Soveraign of the Royal Blood, at lea&s;t by his Mother, I find no probability therein as to the Ea&s;t, where the People are &s;o little wedded to the Blood of their Kings, and where the Kings do think to a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves of the Fidelity of their Wives, by keeping them very clo&s;ely.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Laws of Succe&s;&s;ion for Widows and Children.</NOTE>The Succe&s;&s;ion in particular Families is all for the great Wife, and then for her Children, who inherit from their Parents by equal Portions. The little Wives and their Children may be &s;old by the Heir; and they have only what the Heir gives them, or what the Father before his death has given them from hand to hand, for the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> know not the u&s;e of Wills. The Daughters born of the little Wives, are &s;old to be them&s;elves little Wives; and the mo&s;t powerful purcha&s;ing the hand&s;ome&s;t, without having any regard to the Parents from whom they de&s;cend, do after this manner make very unequal Alliances: and tho&s;e with whom they make them, do not thereby acquire any more Honour or Protection.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wherein con|&s;i&s;ts the For|tune of a <HI>Sia|me&s;e.</HI></NOTE>The E&s;tate of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> con&s;i&s;t chiefly in Moveables. If they have Lands, they have not much, by rea&s;on they cannot obtain the full Property thereof: It belongs always to their King, who at his plea&s;ure takes away the Lands which he has &s;old to particular per&s;ons, and who frequently takes them again without returning the value. Neverthele&s;s the Law of the Country is, that Lands &s;hould be hereditary in Families, and that particular per&s;ons may &s;ell them one to another: But this Prince has regard only to this Law, as far as it &s;uits him, be|cau&s;e it cannot prejudice his Deme&s;nes, which generally extend over all that his Subjects po&s;&s;e&s;s. This is the Rea&s;on that they get as few Immoveables as they can, and that they always endeavor to conceal their Moveables from the know|ledge of their Kings: and becau&s;e that Diamonds are Moveables the mo&s;t ea&s;ie
<PB N="53" REF="36">
to hide and tran&s;port, they are mightily &s;ought after at <HI>Siam,</HI> and in all <HI>India,</HI> and they &s;ell them very dear. Sometimes the <HI>Indian</HI> Lords do at their death give part of their E&s;tate to the King their Ma&s;ter, to &s;ecure the re&s;t to their Family, and this generally &s;ucceeds.</P>
<P>The Families are almo&s;t all happy at <HI>Siam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Divorce.</NOTE> as may be judged by the Fidelity of the Wives in nouri&s;hing their Husband, whil&s;t he &s;erves the King: A Ser|vice which by a kind of Oppre&s;&s;ion la&s;ts not only &s;ix Months in a Year, but &s;ometimes one, two, and three Years together. But when the Husband and Wife cannot &s;upport one another, they have the remedy of Divorce. 'Tis true that it is in practice only among&s;t the Populace; the Rich who have &s;everal Wives, do equally keep tho&s;e they love not, and tho&s;e they love.</P>
<P>The Husband is naturally the Ma&s;ter of the Divorce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What are the Laws thereof.</NOTE> but he never refu&s;eth it to his Wife, when &s;he ab&s;olutely de&s;ires it. He re&s;tores her Portion to her, and their Children are divided among&s;t them in this manner. The Mother has the fir&s;t, the third, the fifth, and &s;o all the odd ones. The Father has the &s;econd, fourth, &s;ixth, and all the even ones. Hence it happens, that if there is no more than one Child, it is for the Mother; and that if the number of Children is unequal, the Mother has one more: whether that they judge the Mother would take more care thereof, than the Father; or that having born them in her womb, or nouri&s;hed them with her milk, &s;he &s;eems to have a greater Right therein, than the Father; or that being weaker, &s;he has more need of the &s;uc|cor of her Children than he.</P>
<P>After the Divorce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And the Con|&s;equences.</NOTE> it is lawful for the Husband and Wife to marry again with whom they plea&s;e; and it is free for the Woman to do it in the very day of the Divorce, they not troubling them&s;elves with the Doubt that may thence ari&s;e touching the Father of the fir&s;t Child, that may be born after the &s;econd Marriage. They rely on what the Wife &s;ays thereof; a great &s;ign of the little Jealou&s;ie of this People. But tho' the Divorce be permitted them, yet they con&s;ider it as a very great Evil, and as the almo&s;t certain Ruine of the Chil|dren, which are ordinarily very ill treated in the &s;econd Marriages of their Pa|rents. So that this is one of the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;igned why the Country is not popu|lous; altho' the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are fruitful, and do very frequently bring Twins.</P>
<P>The power of the Husband is de&s;potical in his Family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pater|nal Power.</NOTE> even to the &s;elling his Children and Wives, his principal Wife excepted, whom he can only repu|diate. The Widows inherit the power of their Husbands, with this re&s;triction, that they cannot &s;ell the Children which they have of the even number, if the Father's Relations oppo&s;e it; for the Children dare not. After the Divorce, the Father and Mother may each &s;ell the Children which fell to them by lot, according to the Divi&s;ion I have mentioned. But the Parents cannot kill their Children, nor the Husband his Wives, by rea&s;on that in general all Murder is prohibited at <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>The Love of free per&s;ons is not ignominious, at lea&s;t among&s;t the Populace:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Amorous Con|ver&s;ations.</NOTE>
It is there look'd upon as a Marriage, and Incontinency as a Divorce. Never|thele&s;s the Parents do carefully watch their Daughters, as I have &s;aid; and Children are no where permitted to di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves to the prejudice of the paternal Power, which is the mo&s;t natural of all Laws. Moreover, the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are naturally too proud ea&s;ily to give them&s;elves to Foreigners, or at lea&s;t to invite them. The <HI>Peguins</HI> which are at <HI>Siam,</HI> as being Strangers them|&s;elves, do more highly e&s;teem of Foreigners; and do pa&s;s for debauched per|&s;ons in the minds of tho&s;e who under&s;tand not that they &s;eek a Husband. Thus they continue faithful until they are abandon'd; and if they prove big with Child, they are not le&s;s e&s;teem'd among&s;t tho&s;e of their Nation, and they do even glory in having had a white Man for a Husband. It may be al&s;o that they are of a more amorous Complexion than the <HI>Siame&s;es;</HI> they have at lea&s;t more &s;pirit and briskne&s;s. 'Tis an e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that the people have more or le&s;s vigor and &s;pirit, according as they are nearer, or remoter from <HI>Pegu.</HI></P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The love of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Children for their Parents.</NOTE>THE <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Children have docility and &s;weetne&s;s, provided they be not di&s;countenanc'd. Their Parents know how to make them&s;elves extream|ly beloved and re&s;pected, and to in&s;pire an extream Civility in them. Their In&s;tructions are marvellou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the De&s;potic Power, which I have &s;aid they have in their Family; but the Parents do al&s;o an&s;wer unto the Prince for the Faults of their Children. They &s;hare in their Cha&s;ti&s;ements, and more e&s;pecially are obliged to deliver them up when they have offended. And tho' the Son be fled, he never fails to return and &s;urrender him&s;elf, when the Prince apprehends his Father, or his Mother, or his other collateral Relations, but older than him&s;elf, and to whom he owes Re&s;pect: And this is a great proof of the love of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Children to their Parents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civility nece&s;|&s;ary to the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></NOTE>As to Civility, it is &s;o great throughout the Ea&s;t, even among&s;t Strangers, that an <HI>European</HI> who has liv'd there a long time, finds much difficulty to re-ac|cu&s;tom him&s;elf to the Familiarities of the&s;e Countries. The <HI>Indian</HI> Princes being very much given to Traffic, they love to invite Strangers among&s;t them, and they protect them even again&s;t their own Subjects. And hence it is that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do for Example appear &s;avage, and that they e&s;chew the Conver&s;a|tion of Strangers. They know that they are thought always to be in the wrong, and that they are always puni&s;h'd in the Quarrels they have with them. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do therefore educate their Children in an extream Mode&s;ty, by rea&s;on that it is nece&s;&s;ary in Trade, and much more in the Service, which for &s;ix Months in the Year they render unto the King, or to the <HI>Mandarins</HI> by order of their King.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Inclina|tion to Si|lence.</NOTE>Silence is not greater among&s;t the <HI>Carthu&s;ians,</HI> than it is in the Palace of this Prince; the Lords di&s;pen&s;e not therewith more than others. The &s;ole de&s;ire of &s;peaking, never excites the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> to &s;ay any thing that may di&s;plea&s;e. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary that they be thoroughly convinced that you would know the truth of any thing, to embolden them to declare it again&s;t your opinion. They do in nothing affect to appear better in&s;tructed than you, not in the things of their own Country, altho' you be a Stranger.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Raillery among&s;t them.</NOTE>They appear'd to me very far from all &s;ort of Raillery, by rea&s;on they under|&s;tand not any, perhaps thro' the fault of the Interpreters. 'Tis principally in matter of Raillery, that this ancient Proverb of the <HI>Indians</HI> is verified, <HI>That things best weighed, when delivered by an Interpreter, are as a pure Spring which runs thro' mud.</HI> Mo&s;t &s;afe it is to droll little with Strangers, even with tho&s;e that un|der&s;tand our Language; becau&s;e that Railleries are the la&s;t thing that they un|der&s;tand, and that it is ea&s;ie to offend them with a Raillery which they under|&s;tand not. I doubt not therefore that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> know how to je&s;t wittily one with another. Some have a&s;&s;ur'd me, that they do it frequently among&s;t Equals, and even in Ver&s;e; and that as well the Women as the Men are all very readily ver&s;t therein; the mo&s;t ordinary method of which is among&s;t them a continued Raillery, wherein emulou&s;ly appears the briskne&s;s of the An|&s;wers and Repartees.

He likewi&s;e ob&s;erves to &s;peak fir&s;t, or la&s;t, according as he can, or as he ought; but he always offers his place to him whom he receives at his Hou&s;e, and invites him to accept it.

Kings Amba&s;&s;adors were in the lower Hall. In the Hou&s;es, which &s;trangers do build of Brick above one &s;tory, they ob&s;erve that the undermo&s;t part of the Stairs never &s;erves for a pa&s;&s;age, for fear le&s;t any one &s;hould go under the feet of another that a&s;cends: but the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> build no more than one &s;tory, by rea&s;on that the bottom would be u&s;ele&s;s to them, no per&s;on among&s;t them being willing either to go or lodge under the feet of another. For this rea&s;on, though the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Hou&s;es be erected on Piles, they never make u&s;e of the un|der part, not &s;o much as in the Kings Hou&s;e, who&s;e Palace being uneven, has &s;ome pieces higher than others, the under part of which might be inhabited.

If there are &s;everal <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> together, and there unexpectedly comes in another, it frequently happens that the po&s;ture of all changes. They know before whom, and to what degree, they mu&s;t keep them&s;elves inclined or &s;trait, or &s;itting: whether they mu&s;t joyn their hands or not, and keep them high, or low: whether being &s;eated they may advance one Foot, or both, or whether they mu&s;t keep them both conceal'd by &s;itting on their heels. And the mi&s;carriages in the&s;e &s;orts of duties may be puni&s;hed with the cudgel by him to whom they are committed, or by his orders, and on the &s;pot. So that there is not introduced among&s;t them tho&s;e Airs of familiarity, which in diver&s;ions do at|tract rudene&s;s, injuries, blows and quarrels, and &s;ometimes intemperance and im|pudence: they are always re&s;trained by reciprocal re&s;pects.

It has no brim before nor behind, but only at the &s;ides: and this brim, which terminates in an oval, is &s;o little fa&s;tened to the body of the Hat, that it flaps, and renders a man ridi|culous, at the lea&s;t irregular motion which he makes of his head. Thus the&s;e people have imagined, that the le&s;s men are at ea&s;e, the fewer faults they com|mit.</P>

For this purpo&s;e we u&s;e a Handkercheif, and few of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have any: which is the rea&s;on why they very &s;lovenly perform every thing whereunto the Hand|kercheif is nece&s;&s;ary. They dare to &s;pit neither on the Mats, nor the Carpets; and becau&s;e they are in all hou&s;es a little furni&s;hed, they make u&s;e of &s;pitting-pots which they carry in their hand. In the Kings Palace they neither cough, nor &s;pit, nor wipe their No&s;e. The <HI>Betel</HI> which they continually chew, and the juice of which they &s;wallow at plea&s;ure, hinders them: Neverthele&s;s they cannot take <HI>Betel</HI> in the Prince's pre&s;ence, but only continue to chew that which they have already in their Mouth.

To touch any per&s;on on the head or the hair, or to &s;troke ones hand over the head, is to offer him the greate&s;t of all affronts. To touch his Bonnet, if he leaves it any where, is a great incivility. The mode of this Country among&s;t the <HI>Europeans</HI> which dwell there, is never to leave their Hat in a low place, but to give it to a Servant, who carries it higher than his Head, at the end of a Stick, and with|out touching it; and this Stick has a foot, to the end that it may &s;tand up, if he that carries it, be obliged to leave it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t re&s;pectful, or to &s;ay better, the mo&s;t humble po&s;ture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What po&s;tures are more or le&s;s re&s;pectful.</NOTE> is that in which they do all keep them&s;elves continually before their King: in which they expre&s;s to him more re&s;pect than the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do to theirs. They keep them|&s;elves pro&s;trate on their knees and elbows, with their hands joyned at the top of their forehead, and their body &s;eated on their heels; to the end that they may lean le&s;s on their elbows, and that it may be po&s;&s;ible (without a&s;&s;i&s;ting them&s;elves with their hands, but keeping them &s;till joyned to the top of their forehead) to rai&s;e them&s;elves on their knees, and fall again upon their elbows, as they do thrice together, as often as they would &s;peak to their King: I have remark'd, that when they are thus pro&s;trate, they lean their back-part on one &s;ide or other, as much as po&s;&s;ibly they can, without di&s;placing their knees, as it were to le&s;&s;en and undervalue them&s;elves the more.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame principle, it is not only more honourable, according to them, to be &s;eated on a high &s;eat, than on a low &s;eat; but it is much more honourable to be &s;tanding than &s;itting. When <HI>Mr. de Chaumont</HI> had his fir&s;t audience, it was nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen which accompany'd him, &s;hould enter fir&s;t into the Hall, and &s;eat them&s;elves on their heels, before the King of <HI>Siam</HI> appeared; to the end that this Prince might not &s;ee them a moment &s;tanding. They were prohibited to ri&s;e up to &s;alute him, when he appeared. This Prince never &s;uffered the Bi&s;hops nor the Je&s;uits to appear &s;tanding before him in the Audiences. It is not permitted to &s;tand in any place of the Palace, unle&s;s while walking: and if in this la&s;t Voyage of 1687, at the fir&s;t audience of the Kings Amba&s;&s;adors, the <HI>French</HI> Gentlemen had the honour of entring, when the King of <HI>Siam</HI> was already vi&s;ible, it was only becau&s;e the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> which had ac|companied the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Siam</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> were admitted into the

They are different al&s;o from the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es,</HI> in that they have not like them a Character for every word, or even for every &s;ignification of a &s;ingle word; to the end that the writing may have no Equivocations like the Language. The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> and <HI>Balie</HI> Tongues have, like ours, an Alphabet of few letters, of which are compos'd &s;yllables and words. Moreover, the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Language participates greatly of the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> in that it has a great deal of Accent, (for their Voice frequently ri&s;es above one fourth) and in that it con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t all of Mono&s;yllables: &s;o that it may be pre&s;umed, that if one perfectly under&s;tood it, one &s;hould find that the few words which it has of &s;everal &s;yllables, are either foreign, or compo&s;ed of Mono&s;yllables, &s;ome of which are u&s;ed only in the&s;e Compo&s;itions.</P>

The placing alone denotes the Ca&s;es in Nouns, and herein their di&s;po&s;ition is hardly different from ours.

The Relations of <HI>China</HI> report, that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Poetry at pre&s;ent is in Rhyme; but tho' they &s;peak of their ancient Poetry, of which they &s;till have &s;everal Works, they declare not of what nature it was, becau&s;e, in my opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They read the ancient Cha|racters in the pre&s;ent Lan|guage.</NOTE> it is difficult to judge thereof: for tho' the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have pre&s;erved the &s;en&s;e of their ancient Writing, they have not pre&s;erved their ancient Language.

of a broken Style full of <HI>Idea's.</HI> They have no Advocates: the Parties do each declare their Cau&s;e to the Regi&s;ter, who, without any Rhetoric, writes down the Facts and Rea&s;ons which are told him.

The King of <HI>Siam</HI> him&s;elf has his words almo&s;t counted in his Audiences of Ceremony; and he &s;pake to the King's Amba&s;&s;adors almo&s;t the &s;ame that he had deliver'd to M^r. <HI>de Chaumont,</HI> and before him to the late Bi&s;hop of <HI>Heliopolis.</HI></P>
<P>I have not forgot that excellent Speech which the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Siam</HI> made to the King at his Audience of Leave,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The la&s;t Speech which the Amba&s;&s;a|dor of <HI>Siam</HI> made in <HI>France.</HI></NOTE> and which alone might cau&s;e a Belief that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are great Orators; if we could judge of the merit of the Original, by that of the Tran&s;lation: But this is difficult, e&s;pecially in two Languages, which have &s;o little &s;imilitude one to the other. All that we ought to think thereof, is, that the main of the De&s;ign and Thought is the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador's; and I wonder not that he has admir'd the excellent Meen, the Maje&s;tic Air, the Power, the Affability, and all the extraordinary qualities of the King. They ought to amaze him more than another, becau&s;e that the&s;e Virtues are ab&s;olutely unknown in the Ea&s;t; and if he had dar'd to declare the Truth, he would have confe&s;&s;ed that the Flattery natural to tho&s;e of his Coun|try, had made him all his life to extol tho&s;e very things where they were not, and that he &s;aw the fir&s;t Example thereof in the King. When the <HI>Mandarins</HI> came on Board our Ship to carry the fir&s;t Compliment of the King of <HI>Siam</HI> to the King's Amba&s;&s;adors, they took Leave of them, by te&s;tifying unto them that they demanded it unwillingly, and out of an indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity of going to &s;atisfie the Impatience of the King their Ma&s;ter, about the things which they had to relate unto him: A Thought natural and good, on which runs the whole beginning of the Amba&s;&s;ador's Speech of Leave. And as to that ex|cellent place where he ends, that their Relation of him and his Colleagues would be put into the Archives of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam;</HI> and that the King their Ma&s;ter would do him an Honour to &s;end him to the Princes his Allies, he was in this a le&s;s Orator, than Hi&s;torian. He render'd an account of a Practice of his Country, which is not omitted in great occa&s;ions, and which is in u&s;e in other Kingdoms. One Example there is in <HI>O&s;orius,</HI> in the 8^t^h Book of his <HI>Hi&s;to|ry</HI> of <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> where he relates how <HI>Alphon&s;us,</HI> the 2^d Chri|&s;tian King of <HI>Congo,</HI> in&s;erted into his Argives the Hi&s;tory of his Conver&s;ion, and that of another famous Emba&s;&s;y which he had received from <HI>Emanuel,</HI> and how he imparted it to all the Princes his Va&s;&s;als. We may therefore be a&s;&s;u|red, that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are not Orators, and that they never have need to be &s;uch. Their Cu&s;tom is not to make either Speech or Compliment to the Princes to whom they &s;end them, but to an&s;wer the things about which the&s;e Princes in|terrogate them. They made a Speech at this Court, to accommodate them|&s;elves to our Cu&s;toms, and to enjoy an Honour they highly valued; which was, to &s;peak to the King, before his Maje&s;ty &s;pake to them. This is all we can &s;ay of their Poetry, and their Rhetoric.</P>
<P>They ab&s;olutely ignore all the parts of Philo&s;ophy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have a Moral Philo|&s;ophy, and no Theology.</NOTE> except &s;ome Principles of Morality, where, as we &s;hall &s;ee in di&s;cour&s;ing of the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> they have in|termixt Truth with Fal&s;hood. I will at the &s;ame time al&s;o demon&s;trate, that they have not any &s;ort of Theology, and that we might perhaps ju&s;tifie them about the wor&s;hipping of the fal&s;e Deities whereof they are accu&s;ed, by an Impiety more culpable, which is not to acknowledge any Divinity neither true nor fal&s;e.</P>
<P>They &s;tudy not the Civil Law:<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they &s;tudy their Laws.</NOTE> They learn the Laws of their Country on|ly in Employments. They are not Public, as I have &s;aid, for want of Print|ing; but when they enter into any Office, they put into their hands a Copy of the Laws which concern it: And the &s;ame thing is practi&s;ed in <HI>Spain,</HI> tho' the
<PB N="62" REF="41">
Laws be there in the hands of all per&s;ons, and that there are publick Schools, to teach them.

The others are obliged to report dai|ly unto him the &s;tate of this Prince's health, and to receive from his hand the Remedies which he prepares for him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They under|&s;tand not Chy|rurgery nor Anatomy.</NOTE>Their chief Ignorance is to know nothing in Chyrurgery, and to &s;tand in need of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> not only for Trapans, and for all the other difficult Operati|ons of Chyrurgery, but for &s;imple Blood-lettings. They are utterly ignorant of Anatomy: and &s;o far from having excited their Curio&s;ity, to di&s;cover either the Circulation of the Blood, or all the new things, that we know touching the &s;tructure of the body of Animals, that they open not the dead bodies, till af|ter having roa&s;ted them in their Funeral &s;olemnities, under pretence of burning them; and they open them only to &s;eek wherewith to abu&s;e the &s;uper&s;titious credulity of the people. For example, they alledge that they &s;ometimes find in the Stomach of the dead, great pieces of fre&s;h Pig's fle&s;h, or of &s;ome other Animal, about eight or ten pound in weight: and they &s;uppo&s;e that it has been put therein by &s;ome Divination, and that it is good to perform others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They have not any princi|ple, but Re|ceipts.</NOTE>They trouble not them&s;elves to have any principle of Medicine, but only a number of Receipts, which they have learnt from their Ance&s;tors, and in which they never alter any thing. They have no regard to the particular &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es: and yet they fail not to cure a great many; becau&s;e that the natural Temperance of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> pre&s;erves them from a great many evils difficult to cure. But when at la&s;t it happens that the Di&s;temper is &s;tronger than the Remedies, they fail not to attribute the cau&s;e thereof to Inchantment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Phy&s;icians are great Mounte|banks.</NOTE>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> under&s;tanding one day that I was &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed, tho it was &s;o little, that I kept not my Chamber, he had the goodne&s;s to &s;end all his Phy&s;icians to me. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> offer'd &s;ome Civility to the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> and <HI>Peguins:</HI> and then they made me &s;it, and &s;at down them&s;elves: and after ha|ving demanded &s;ilence, for the company was numerous, they felt my pul&s;e one after the other a long time, to make me &s;u&s;pect that it was not only a grimace. I had read that at <HI>China</HI> there is no School for Phy&s;icians, and that one is there admitted to exerci&s;e the profe&s;&s;ion thereof, at mo&s;t by a flight examination made by a Magi&s;trate of Ju&s;tice, and not by Doctors in Phy&s;ick.

After having felt my pul&s;e, they &s;aid that I was a little feveri&s;h, but di&s;cerned it not at all: they added that my Stomach was out of order, and I perceived it not, &s;ave that my voice was a little weak. The next morning the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> return'd alone to pre&s;ent me a &s;mall Potion warm, in a China Cup cover'd and very neat.

But the difference that there

is between the Mountebanks of <HI>China</HI> and the Quacks of <HI>Europe</HI> on the account of Medicine, is that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do abu&s;e the &s;ick by plea&s;ant and enticing Re|medies, and that the <HI>Europeans</HI> do give us Drugs, which the humane Body &s;eeks to get rid off by all manner of means: &s;o that we are inclined to believe that they would not thus torment a &s;ick per&s;on, if it was not certainly very nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>When any per&s;on is &s;ick at <HI>Siam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Reme|dies are u&s;ed at <HI>Siam&punc;</HI></NOTE> he begins with cau&s;ing his whole body to be moulded by one that is skilful herein, who gets upon the Body of the &s;ick per&s;on, and tramples him under his feet. 'Tis likewi&s;e reported that great bel|ly'd women do thus cau&s;e them&s;elves to be trodden under foot by a Child, to procure them&s;elves to be delivered with le&s;s pain: for in hot Countries, though their Deliveries &s;eem to be more ea&s;ie by the natural Conformation of the wo|men, yet they are very painful, by rea&s;on perhaps that they are preceded with le&s;s Evacuation.</P>
<P>Antiently the <HI>Indians</HI> apply'd no other Remedy to plenitude, than an Exce&s;|&s;ive diet; and this is &s;till the principal &s;ubtilty of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> in Medicine. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do now make u&s;e of Blood-letting, provided they may have an <HI>European</HI> Chyrurgion: and &s;ometimes in&s;tead of Blood-letting they do u&s;e Cupping-gla&s;|&s;es, Scarifications and Leeches.</P>
<P>They have &s;ome Purgatives which we make u&s;e of, and others which are pe|culiar to them; but they know not the <HI>Hellebore,</HI> &s;o familiar to the Antient Greek Phy&s;icians. Moreover they ob&s;erve not any time in purging, and know not what the Cri&s;is is: though they under&s;tand the benefit of Sweats in di&s;tempers, and do highly applaud the u&s;e of Sudorificks.</P>
<P>In their Remedies they do u&s;e Minerals and Simples, and the <HI>Europeans</HI> have made known the <HI>Quinquina</HI> unto them. In general all their Remedies are very hot; and they u&s;e not any inward Refre&s;hment: but they bath them&s;elves in Fevers, and in all &s;orts of di&s;ea&s;es.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The mo&s;t An|cient al&s;o ap|pears Arbitra|ry.</NOTE>By the &s;ame Rea&s;on I am per&s;uaded, that their mo&s;t Ancient <HI>Epocha,</HI> from which in this Year 1689, they compute 2233 Years, has not been remarkable at <HI>Siam</HI> for any thing worthy of Memory, and that it proves not that the King|dom of <HI>Siam</HI> is of that Antiquity.

<P>But if the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do &s;till make u&s;e thereof in their Dates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Variety of Style in their Dates.</NOTE> after having re|linqui&s;h'd it in their A&s;tronomical Calculations, it is becau&s;e that in things of Style they do not ea&s;ily alter the U&s;ages unto which they are accu&s;tomed; and yet they cea&s;e not to date &s;ometimes with re&s;pect to that modern <HI>Epocha</HI> which they have taken, as I have &s;aid, from the Year of our Lord 638.

<P>This, in few words, is the whole Skill of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> in A&s;tronomy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> do think of the Sy&s;tem of the World.</NOTE> More|over, they under&s;tand nothing of the true Sy&s;tem of the World, becau&s;e they know nothing by Rea&s;on. They believe therefore, like all the Ea&s;t, that the Eclip&s;es are cau&s;ed by &s;ome Dragon, which devours the Sun and Moon (per|haps by rea&s;on of the A&s;tronomer's metaphorical way of &s;peaking, that the Eclip&s;es are made in the Head and Tail of the Dragon:) And they make a great noi&s;e, with Fire-&s;hovels and Kettles, to &s;care and drive away this pernicious Animal, and to deliver tho&s;e beauteous Planets. They believe the Earth Four-&s;quare, and of va&s;t Extent, on which the Arch of Heaven re&s;ts at its ex|tremities, as if it was one of our Gla&s;s-Bells with which we cover &s;ome of our Plants in our Gardens. They a&s;&s;ert, that the Earth is divided into four habi|table parts of the World, &s;o &s;eparated one from the other by Seas, that they are, as it were, <HI>four</HI> different <HI>Worlds.</HI> In the middle of the&s;e <HI>four Worlds,</HI> they &s;uppo&s;e an exceeding high Pyramidal Mountain with four equal &s;ides, called, <HI>Caou pra Soumene (Caou</HI> &s;ignifies, a <HI>Mountain,</HI> and to <HI>Mount;</HI>) and from the Surface of the Earth, or the Sea, to the top of this Mountain, which, as they &s;ay, touches the Stars, they compute 84000 <HI>Iods,</HI> and every <HI>Iod</HI> contains about 8000 Fathoms. They reckon as many <HI>Iods</HI> from the Surface of the Sea to the Foundations of the Mountain; and they likewi&s;e reckon 84000 <HI>Iods</HI> extent of Sea from each of the four &s;ides of this Mountain to every of the four Worlds which I have mentioned. Now our World, which they call <HI>Tchiampion,</HI> lies, as they report, to the South of this Mountain, and the Sun, Moon and Stars do ince&s;&s;antly turn round it; and it is that, which according to them, makes the <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night.</HI> At the top of this Mountain is a Heaven, which they call <HI>In|tratiracha,</HI> which is &s;urmounted by the Heaven of Angels. This Sample, which is all I know thereof, will &s;uffice to demon&s;trate their Gro&s;sne&s;s; and if it does not exactly accord to what others have writ before me concerning this matter, we mu&s;t not more admire the variety of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Opinions in a thing they under&s;tand not, than the contrariety of our Sy&s;tems in A&s;tronomy, which we pretend to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>The extream Super&s;tition of the <HI>Indians</HI> is therefore a very natural Con&s;e|quence of their profound Ignorance; but for their Excu&s;e, &s;ome People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> are Super&s;ti|tious propor|tionably to their extream Ignorance.</NOTE> more illuminated than them, have not been le&s;s Super&s;titious.

They thought that it was the goodne&s;s of the Gods, to be&s;tow on Men &s;ome Succors to penetrate Futurities; and the words <HI>Divination</HI> and <HI>Divine</HI> are the &s;ame word in their Origine, becau&s;e that according to the ancient <HI>Pagans,</HI> the Art of Divining was only an Art to con&s;ult the Deities. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are al&s;o of opinion, that there is an Art of Prophecying, as there is one of re&s;toring Health to the Sick: And when the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Sooth&s;ayers are mi&s;taken, he cau&s;es them to be ba&s;tinado'd, not as Impo&s;tors, but as negligent per&s;ons; as he commands his Phy&s;icians to be cudgell'd, when the Remedies they give him, perform not the Effect which is thereby promi&s;ed.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> accu&s;ed of Sorcery, and why.</NOTE>But that which has rais'd the Reputation of great Sorcerers among&s;t the <HI>In|dians,</HI> is principally the continual Conjurations which they u&s;e to drive away the evil Spirits with, and attract the good.

In a Storm at Sea, they will fa&s;ten to all the Tackle &s;uch like written Papers, which they believe proper to a&s;&s;uage the Winds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Super&s;titions for Women in Child-bed.</NOTE>The &s;uper&s;titions which they u&s;e towards Women in Child-bed, appear not le&s;s ridiculous, although they be founded perhaps on &s;ome benefit for health. They believe that Women in Child-bed have need of being purified: whether that the <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;pread throughout the Earth, have &s;owed this Tradition among&s;t &s;everal Nations, or that the people of hot Countries are more ea&s;ily prejudiced than tho&s;e of cold Countries with the natural impurities of Women. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> keep the Women in Child-bed before a continual and great fire for a month, where they turn them &s;ometimes on one &s;ide, &s;ometimes on the other. The &s;moak does greatly incommode them, and pa&s;&s;es &s;lowly through an Aperture, which they make in the roof of their hou&s;es. The <HI>Peguins</HI> do put their Wives on a kind of Bambou-grate, very nigh, with fire underneath; but
<PB N="67" REF="43">
they keep them thus no more than four or five days. At the up-ri&s;ing, the one and the other return thanks to the Fire for having purified their Wives; and in the Entertainment which they give on this occa&s;ion to their Friends, they eat nothing which they have not fir&s;t offered to the Fire, leaving it &s;ome time near it. During the whole time of lying in Child-bed, the Women neither eat nor drink any thing that is not hot: and I under&s;tand that our <HI>Midwives.</HI> forbid their Women al&s;o to drink any thing cold.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;peedy and mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible effects of the pretended Divinations of the <HI>Indians</HI> are in the u&s;e of certain Philtres, which are only natural drinks.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philtres look'd upon as the effect of Magick.</NOTE>
The <HI>Indies</HI> do produce &s;ome Simples, the kinds, force, or u&s;e of which we un|der&s;tand not. The Amorous <HI>Philtres,</HI> or Love-potions, are tho&s;e which debi|litate the Imagination, and make a Man to become a Child; &s;o that after this it is ea&s;ie to govern him. My dome&s;ticks a&s;&s;ur'd me that they had &s;een a man at <HI>Batavia,</HI> of whom it was reported that his wife had render'd him &s;en&s;ele&s;s after this manner. Other drinks do cau&s;e other effects. The Relations are full of tho&s;e which the women of <HI>Goa</HI> frequently give their Husbands; and which render them &s;o &s;tupid for 24 hours, that they can then be unfaithful to them in their pre&s;ence. <HI>Opium,</HI> or the quinte&s;&s;ence of Poppies, cau&s;es &s;uch different ef|fects, that it procures &s;leep, or watchfulne&s;s, as it is variou&s;ly prepared. The <HI>Indians</HI> going to Battel, do take thereof to in&s;pire them with courage, or rather with fury. They then run headlong upon the Enemy like wild Boars: It is dangerous to attend them, but one may avoid them by turning out of the way, for they go forwards. Moreover, the effect of <HI>Opium</HI> la&s;ts only &s;ome hours, af|ter which they relap&s;e not only into their natural cowardice, but into a faint|ne&s;s, which leaves them but little action for their defence. And &s;uch were tho&s;e <HI>Maca&s;&s;ers,</HI> which had con&s;pired again&s;t the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> &s;ome months be|fore the Kings Amba&s;&s;adors arrived there.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have likewi&s;e &s;ome Di&s;tempers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;tempers con&s;idered as the Effects of Magick.</NOTE> the &s;ymptoms of which are &s;ometimes &s;o &s;trange, that they think the cau&s;e thereof can be attributed only to Witchcraft. But be&s;ides the&s;e extraordinary ca&s;es, their Phy&s;icians do al|mo&s;t continually accu&s;e the greater Energy of the Spirits, with the inefficaciou&s;|ne&s;s of their Remedies; and they do herein play &s;uch &s;ubtile juggling tricks, or rather they deal with per&s;ons &s;o credulous, that whil&s;t we were at <HI>Siam,</HI> they made a &s;ick man believe, that he had voided a Deers skin with a Medicine, and that he mu&s;t have &s;wallowed this Deers skin by a Magical effect, and without per|ceiving it. This is what I judged nece&s;&s;ary to relate concerning the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> Su|per&s;titions, of which every one may judge as he plea&s;es: for if on the one hand I have &s;een nothing which obliges me to accu&s;e them of Sorcery, on the other hand I am not concern'd to ju&s;tifie them entirely.</P>
<P>But before we quit this &s;ubject I will here add one thing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Super&s;tition or Vanity touching the walls of Cities.</NOTE> which may be at|tributed at your plea&s;ure, to Super&s;tition or Vanity: One day when the King's Amba&s;&s;adors were &s;aluted by the real or &s;uppo&s;ed Amba&s;&s;adors, from <HI>Patana, Camboya,</HI> and &s;ome other neighbouring Courts, the Amba&s;&s;adors of &s;ome of the &s;everal Nations which are at <HI>Siam,</HI> were al&s;o at this Vi&s;it: and among the re&s;t there were two, who &s;aid that the City of their Origine, the name of which I have forgot, remained no more: but that it had been &s;o con&s;iderable, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to go round it in three Months.

They know not what the Art of Riding the Great Hor&s;e is: Arms they have none, except the King gives them &s;ome; and they cannot purcha&s;e any, till he has given them &s;ome. They exerci&s;e them only by the Order of this Prince. They never fire the Mu&s;quet &s;tanding, no not in War: To di&s;charge it, they place one Knee on the ground, and frequently proceed to &s;it on their Heel, &s;tretching forward the other Leg, which they have not bent. They hardly know to march, or keep them&s;elves on their Feet with a good grace. They never &s;tretch out their Hams well, be|cau&s;e they are accu&s;tomed to keep them bended. The <HI>French</HI> taught them how to &s;tand to their Arms, and till the arrival of the King's Ships at <HI>Siam,</HI> their Sentinels them&s;elves &s;at upon the ground. So far are they from running Ra|ces, purely for Recreation &s;ake, that they never walk abroad. The heat of the Climate cau&s;es a great Con&s;umption in them. Wre&s;tling, and Fi&s;ty-cuffs, are the Jugler's Trade. The running of <HI>Balons</HI> is therefore their &s;ole Exerci&s;e. The Oar and <HI>Pagaye</HI> are in this Country the Trade of all the People from four or five years old. They can Row three days and three nights almo&s;t without re&s;ting, altho' they cannot undergo any other Work.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIII.</HI> Of the Arts exerci&s;ed by the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THey have no Companies of Trades,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are bad Artificers, and why.</NOTE> and the Arts flouri&s;h not among&s;t them, not only by rea&s;on of their natural &s;luggi&s;hne&s;s, but much more by rea&s;on of the Government under which they live. There being no &s;ecurity for the wealth of particular per&s;ons, but to conceal it well every one there con|tinues in &s;o great a &s;implicity, that mo&s;t of the Arts are not nece&s;&s;ary to them, and that the Workmen cannot meet with the ju&s;t value of the Works on which they would be&s;tow a great deal of Expence and Labour. Moreover, as every particular Per&s;on does Annually owe &s;ix Months &s;ervice to the King, and that frequently he is not di&s;charged for &s;ix Months, there is no Per&s;on in this Coun|try that dares to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf in any Art, for fear of being forced to work <HI>gratis</HI> all his life for the &s;ervice of this Prince. And becau&s;e that they are in|differently employ'd in the&s;e Works, every one applies him&s;elf to know how to do a little of all, to avoid the Ba&s;tinados; but none would do too well, be|cau&s;e that Servitude is the reward of Ingenuity. They neither know, nor de|&s;ire to know how to do otherwi&s;e, than what they have always done. 'Tis no matter to them to have 500 Workmen, for &s;everal Months, upon what a few
<PB N="70" REF="45">
<HI>Europeans,</HI> well paid, would fini&s;h in a few days. If any Stranger gives them any direction, or any Machine, they forget it &s;o &s;oon as their Prince forgets it. Wherefore no <HI>European</HI> offers his &s;ervice to an <HI>Indian</HI> Prince, who is not receiv'd, as I may &s;ay, with open Arms. How little Merit &s;oever he may have, he al|ways has more than the natural <HI>Indians;</HI> and not only for the Mechanic Arts, but for the Sea, and for Commerce, to which they are much more affected. The Inconvenience is, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings do well know the Secret, either of en|riching a Stranger only with hopes, or of detaining him among&s;t them if they have really enrich'd him. Nothing is &s;o magnificent as the Grants which the great <HI>Mogul</HI> gives: But is there found one <HI>European</HI> that has carry'd away much wealth out of his Service?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What Arts they exerci&s;e.</NOTE>To return to the Indu&s;try of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> the Arts which they under&s;tand are the&s;e. They are rea&s;onable good Joyners, and becau&s;e they have no Nails, they very well under&s;tand how to fa&s;ten pieces together. They pretend to Sculpture, but gro&s;ly perform it. The Statues of their Temples are very ill made. They know how to burn Brick, and make excellent Ciments, and are not unskill'd in Ma&s;onry. Neverthele&s;s their Brick Buildings do not la&s;t, for want of Foundations: they do not make any, even in their Fortifications. They have no melted Cry&s;tal, nor Gla&s;s; and it is one of the things they mo&s;t e&s;teem. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> was extreamly plea&s;ed with tho&s;e Fo&s;&s;et-cut Gla&s;|&s;es, which multiply an Object; and he demanded entire Windows with the &s;ame property.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Windows of the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></NOTE>The Windows of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are compos'd with Threds of Gla&s;s as big as Straws, laid one by another, and glued at the ends to Paper, as we &s;older the Quarries of Gla&s;s into our Window-frames. They do frequently put &s;ome Paintings on the&s;e &s;orts of Gla&s;&s;es, and with the&s;e Gla&s;&s;es thus painted, they &s;ometimes make Pannels of Screens, behind which they love to &s;et &s;ome lights, becau&s;e they extreamly admire the Fancy of Illuminations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> do u&s;e Metals.</NOTE>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do know to melt Metals, and ca&s;t &s;ome Works in Molds. They do cover their Idols, which are &s;ometimes enormous ma&s;&s;es of Brick and Lime, with a very thin Plate either of Gold or Silver, or Copper. I have in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion a little <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> which is thus cover'd over with a Copper Plate gilded, and which is yet full of the Ciment, which &s;erved as the Model. With &s;uch a Plate of Gold or Silver they cover certain of their King's Move|ables, and the Iron hilt of the Sabres and Daggers, which he pre&s;ents to &s;ome of his Officers, and &s;ometimes to Strangers. They are not wholly ignorant of the Gold&s;mith's Trade; but they neither know how to poli&s;h, nor to &s;et precious Stones.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they write on a Leaf of Gold.</NOTE>They are excellent Gilders, and know very well how to beat the Gold. As often as the King of <HI>Siam</HI> writes to another King, he does it upon a Leaf of that Metal as thin as a Leaf of Paper. The Letters are imprinted thereon with a blunt Poin&s;on or Bodkin, like tho&s;e with which we write in our Table-Books.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are bad Smiths, and no Tanners.</NOTE>They make u&s;e of Iron only as it is Ca&s;t, by rea&s;on they are bad Forge-men; their Hor&s;es are not &s;hod, and have commonly Stirrups of Rope, and very paltry Snaffles. They have no better Saddles, the Art of Tanning and prepa|ring Skins, being ab&s;olutely unknown at <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They make little Linnen, and no Stuffs.</NOTE>They make little Cotton-Cloth, and that very cour&s;e, with a very na&s;ty Painting, and only in the Metropolis. They make no Stuffs, neither of Silk, nor Wooll, nor any Tape&s;try-work: Wooll is here very &s;carce. They under&s;tand Embroidery, and their De&s;igns plea&s;e.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The painting of the <HI>Siame|&s;es</HI> and <HI>Chine|&s;es.</HI></NOTE>In one of their Temples I &s;aw a very plea&s;ant Picture in <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> the Colours of which were lively.

<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> and <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> know not how to paint in Oil; and, moreover, they are bad Painters. Their Fancy is to &s;light and di&s;e&s;teem whatever is after Nature only. To them it &s;eems that an exact Imitation is too ea&s;ie, wherefore
<PB N="71" REF="45">
they overdo every thing. They will therefore have Extravagancies in Paint|ing, as we will have Wonders in Poetry. They repre&s;ent Trees, Flowers, Birds, and other Animals, which never were. They &s;ometimes give unto Men impo&s;|&s;ible Proportions, and the Secret is, to give to all the&s;e things a Facility, which may make them to appear Natural. This is what concerns the Arts.</P>

and Merchandize for all tho&s;e that have wherewith to follow it. I &s;ay all, not excepting their King him&s;elf. But the Foreign Trade being re&s;erved al|mo&s;t entire to the King, the Home Trade is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is impo&s;|&s;ible to rai&s;e any competent Fortune thereby. That &s;implicity of Manners, which makes the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> to let go mo&s;t of the Arts, makes them al&s;o to &s;light mo&s;t of the Commodities which are nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>Europeans;</HI> yet &s;ee how the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> carry on their Commerce.</P>
<P>In their Loans, a third per&s;on, who&s;oever he be, writes down the Promi&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What their private Wri|tings are.</NOTE> and this &s;ufficeth them in Ju&s;tice, becau&s;e it is determined again&s;t the word of the Debtor who denies, upon the double Te&s;timony of him that produ|ces the Promi&s;e, and of him that writ. It is nece&s;&s;ary only that it ap|pear by the viewing of the Writing, that it is not the Creditor that writ the Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>Moreover, they &s;ign no Writings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What their Signature is.</NOTE> neither do they apply any Seal to private Writings. 'Tis only the Magi&s;trates that have a Seal, that is properly a Seal which the King gives them as an In&s;trument of their Offices. Particular Per|&s;ons, in&s;tead of a Signature, do put a &s;ingle Cro&s;s; and tho' this kind of Signa|ture be practi&s;ed by all, yet every one knows the Cro&s;s which is under his own hand; and it is very rare, they &s;ay, that any one is of a Reputation &s;o bad as to di&s;own it in Ju&s;tice. In a word, I &s;hall tran&s;iently declare, that we mu&s;t not &s;earch out any My&s;tery in that they &s;ign with a Cro&s;s: 'Tis among&s;t them on|ly a kind of Flouri&s;h which they have preferr'd before any other, probably be|cau&s;e it is more plain.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that they endow the Virgins at their marrying;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have no public Wri|ting nor No|taries.</NOTE> and that the Por|tion is paid to the Husband in pre&s;ence of the Parents, but without any Wri|ting. I have &s;aid al&s;o, that they make no Will, and that before their death they di&s;po&s;e of their E&s;tate with their own hand, and to whom they plea&s;e, and that after this manner Cu&s;tom di&s;po&s;es of their Inheritance. They Trade little with Immoveables, no per&s;on among&s;t them thinking it &s;afe to purcha&s;e Land of another; the Prince gives, or &s;ells thereof, to whoever would have it. But the real Property remaining always in him, is the rea&s;on that none in this Country does care to purcha&s;e much Land, nor to meliorate it, for fear of ex|citing a de&s;ire of it in one more powerful than him&s;elf. And thus needing no Writings of long continuance, they have not thought fit to have any Notaries.</P>
<P>As to the &s;mall Trades, they are almo&s;t all of &s;o little Con&s;equence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;mall Trades.</NOTE> and Fi|delity is there &s;o great, that in the Bazars or Markets the Seller counts not the Money which he receives, nor the Buyer the Commodity, which he purcha&s;es by Tale.

They u&s;e it in Buildings, in &s;urveying of Land, and perhaps in other things; and e&s;pecially in mea&s;uring the Roads, or Channels, through which the King generally pa&s;&s;es. Thus from <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>Louvo,</HI> every Mile is marked with a Po&s;t, on which they have writ the number of the Mile. The &s;ame thing is ob|&s;erv'd in the Country of the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> where <HI>Bernier</HI> reports, that they mark the <HI>Ko&s;&s;es,</HI> or Half-miles, with Tourrettes, or little Pyramids, and every one knows that the <HI>Romans</HI> denoted their Miles with Stones.</P>

As all the <HI>Coco's</HI> are naturally unequal, they mea&s;ure the Capacity thereof by tho&s;e little Shells called <HI>Coris,</HI> which &s;erve for &s;mall Money at <HI>Siam,</HI> and which are not &s;en&s;ibly greater one than the other. There is therefore &s;uch a <HI>Coco</HI> which contains a thou&s;and <HI>Coris,</HI> as &s;ome have informed me, &s;uch an one which con|tains five hundred, and &s;uch another more or le&s;s. To mea&s;ure Corn they have a kind of <HI>Bu&s;hel,</HI> called <HI>Sat</HI> in the <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> which is made only with interlac'd Bambou; and to mea&s;ure Liquors, they have a Pitcher called <HI>Canan</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e, Choup</HI> in <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> and it is according to the&s;e &s;orts of Mea&s;ures, that they make their Markets. But for want of Policy, and a <HI>Standard,</HI> according to which the Mea&s;ures &s;hould legally be regulated, the Buyer accepts them only after ha|ving mea&s;ur'd them with his <HI>Coco,</HI> the Capacity of which he knows by the <HI>Coris;</HI> and he u&s;es either Water, or Rice, according as he would mea&s;ure either the <HI>Canan</HI> or the <HI>Sat</HI> with his <HI>Coco.</HI> In a word, the quarter of the <HI>Canan</HI> is called <HI>Leeng,</HI> and forty <HI>Sats</HI> do make the <HI>Se&s;te,</HI> and forty <HI>Se&s;te's</HI> the <HI>Cohi.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to de|clare the re&s;emblance which Mea&s;ures &s;o little exact have with ours.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Money &s;erves them for Weights.</NOTE>They are not more exact as to their Weights, in general they call them <HI>Ding;</HI> and the pieces of their Money are more nice and true, and almo&s;t the only ones which they u&s;e, altho' their Money be frequently fal&s;e or light. Some inform'd me, as a thing very remarkable, that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> &s;old cour&s;e Silver by weight, becau&s;e they had &s;een in the Market that Commodity in one of the Scales, and the &s;ilver Money which &s;erv'd as a Weight in the other.

Their Stamps (for they have two on each piece, &s;truck one at the &s;ide of the other in the middle of the Cylinder, and not at the ends) do repre&s;ent nothing that we knew, and they have not explain'd them to me. The proportion of their Money to ours is, that their <HI>Tical,</HI> which weighs no more than half a Crown, is yet worth three &s;hillings and three half-pence.

But tho the Women of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> be capable of &s;acrificing their life to their glory, there cea&s;es not to be &s;ome among&s;t them, who take &s;ecret plea&s;ures when they can, and who hazard their glory and their life upon this account. 'Tis reported that there have been &s;ome examples hereof among&s;t the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Wives: How clo&s;ely &s;oever they be &s;hut up, they do &s;ometimes find out a way to have Lovers. Some have a&s;&s;ur'd me, that the ordinary method by which this Prince puni&s;hes them, is fir&s;t to &s;ubmit them to a Hor&s;e, accu&s;tomed I know not how, to the love of Women, and then to put them to death. 'Tis &s;ome years &s;ince he gave one to the Tygers, and becau&s;e the&s;e Animals &s;pared her at the fir&s;t, he offered her a Pardon: but this Woman was &s;o unworthy as to refu&s;e it, and with &s;o many affronts, that the King looking upon her as di&s;tracted, ordered again that &s;he &s;hould dye. They irritated the Tygers, and they tore her in pieces in his pre&s;ence. It is not &s;o certain that he puts the Lovers to death, but at the lea&s;t he cau&s;es them to be &s;everely cha&s;tized. The common opinion at <HI>Siam</HI> is, that 'twas a fault of this nature, which cau&s;ed the la&s;t di&s;grace of the late <HI>Barcalon,</HI> elder Brother to the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;adour to the King. The King his Ma&s;ter cau&s;ed him to be very &s;everely ba&s;tinado'd, and forbore to &s;ee him, yet without taking away his Offices. On the contrary, he conti|nued to make u&s;e of him during the &s;ix months, that he &s;urvived the blows which he had received; and he with his own hand prepared all the Remedies which the <HI>Barcalon</HI> took in his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, becau&s;e no per&s;on dared to give him any, for fear of being accu&s;ed of the death of a man, who appeared &s;o dear to his Ma&s;ter. <HI>Bernier</HI> relates &s;ome examples, by which it appears that the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> does not always puni&s;h the Women of his <HI>Seraglio</HI> that offend|ed in their duty, nor the Men that are their Accomplices, with death. The&s;e Princes con&s;ider the&s;e &s;orts of Crimes, like the others, which may be commit|ted again&s;t their Maje&s;ty, unle&s;s any &s;entiment of Love renders them more &s;en&s;ible of Jealou&s;ie.</P>

'Tis properly among&s;t them that opportunity makes the Thief. They place the Idea of per|fect Ju&s;tice in not gathering up lo&s;t things, that is to &s;ay in not laying hold on &s;o ea&s;ie an occa&s;ion of getting.

But the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are very remote from &s;o exqui&s;ite a probity.</P>
<P>Father <HI>d' E&s;pagnac,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Some exam|ples of Theft committed by the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></NOTE> one of tho&s;e pious and learned Je&s;uits which we carried to <HI>Siam,</HI> being one day alone in the Divan of their Hou&s;e, a <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> came boldly to take away an excellent <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Carpet from off a Table that was before him: and Father <HI>d' E&s;pagnac</HI> let him do it, becau&s;e he imagined not that he was a Robber. In the Journey which the King cau&s;ed the Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>Siam</HI> to make into <HI>Flanders,</HI> one of the <HI>Mandarins</HI> which accompanied them, took twen|ty Scions in a hou&s;e, where the Amba&s;&s;adors were invited to dine, as they &s;o|journed in one of the principal Cities of <HI>Picardy.</HI> The next day this <HI>Mandarin</HI> conceiving that the&s;e Scions were Money; gave one to a Footman to drink; and his Theft was hereby di&s;covered, but no Notice taken thereof.</P>
<P>Behold likewi&s;e an ingenious prank, which proves that the opportunity of &s;tealing has &s;o much power over them, that it &s;ometimes &s;ways them, even when it is perilous. One of the Officers of the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Magazines having &s;tolen &s;ome Silver, this Prince ordered him to be put to death, by forcing him to &s;wallow three or four Ounces of melted Silver, and it happened, that he who had order to take tho&s;e three or four Ounces of Silver out of that Wretch's throat, could not forbear filching part of it. The King therefore cau&s;ed him to die of the &s;ame puni&s;hment, and a third expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the &s;ame hazard by com|mitting the like Offence: I mean by &s;tealing part of the Silver, which he took out of the la&s;t dead Man's throat. So that the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> pardoning him his Life, &s;aid, there is enough puni&s;ht, I &s;hould de&s;troy all my Subjects, if I &s;hould not re&s;olve to pardon them at la&s;t.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t not be doubted after this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Robbers in the Woods of <HI>Si|am</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> which do ve|ry rarely kill.</NOTE> of what is reported of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> who live in the Woods, to withdraw them&s;elves from the Government, that they frequently rob the Pa&s;&s;engers, yet without killing any. The Woods of <HI>China</HI> have been continually pe&s;tered with &s;uch Robbers: and there are &s;ome who af|ter having enticed a great many Companions with them, have formed whole Ar|mies, and at la&s;t rendered them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of that great Kingdom.</P>
<P>On the other hand, Fidelity is exceeding great at <HI>Siam,</HI> in all &s;orts of Traffick,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fidelity of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> in Commerce, their bound|le&s;s U&s;ury, and their Avarice.</NOTE>

Avarice is their e&s;&s;ential Vice; and what is more wonderful herein, is that they heap not up riches to u&s;e them, but to bury them.</P>
<P>As they traffick not almo&s;t with immoveables, make no Wills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are ve|ry revengful, and how.</NOTE> nor publick Contracts, and as in a word they have no Notaries, it &s;eems that they cannot almo&s;t have any Suits, and they have indeed few Civil, but a great many Cri|minal cau&s;es. 'Tis principally out of &s;pight that they exerci&s;e their &s;ecret Ha|treds and Revenges; and they find facility therein with the Judges, who in this Country, as in <HI>Europe,</HI> do live on their profe&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have naturally an aver&s;ion to blood: but when they hate, even unto death, which is very rare,

they a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate, or they poy&s;on, and under&s;tand not the uncertain Revenge of Duels, yet mo&s;t of their quarrels do terminate only in blows, or reciprocal de|famations.</P>

They are courteous, polite, fearful, and carele&s;s. They contain them&s;elves a long time, but when once their Rage is kindled, they have perhaps le&s;s di&s;cretion than we have. Their Timidity, their Avarice, their Di&s;&s;imulation, their Silences, their Inclination to lying do increa&s;e with them. They are &s;tiff in their Cu&s;toms, as much out of Idlene&s;s, as out of re&s;pect to their Ance&s;tors, who have tran&s;mitted them to them. They have no curio&s;ity, and do admire nothing. They are proud with tho&s;e that deal gently with them, and humble to tho&s;e that treat them with rigour. They are &s;ubtile and variable, like all tho&s;e that perceive their own weakne&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Friend|&s;hip is perfidi|ous.</NOTE>Their manner of promi&s;ing them&s;elves an eternal amity, is by drinking of the &s;ame <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> in the &s;ame Cup, and when they would &s;wear them&s;elves more &s;olemnly, they ta&s;te the blood one of another; which <HI>Lucian</HI> gives us for a Cu|&s;tom of the ancient <HI>Scythians,</HI> and which is practi&s;ed al&s;o by the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and by other Nations: but the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> cea&s;e not &s;ometimes to betray after all the&s;e Ceremonies.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are na|turally more moderate than we are, be|cau&s;e they are more dull.</NOTE>In general they have more Moderation than us: their Humors are as calm as their Heaven, which changes only twice a year and in&s;en&s;ibly, when it turns by little and little from Rain to Fair-weather, and from Fair-weather to Rain.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> Of the &s;everal Conditions among the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AT <HI>Siam</HI> all Per&s;ons are either Freemen or Slaves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Slave|ry according to the Man|ners of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> The Ma&s;ter has all power over the Slave, except that of killing him: And tho' &s;ome may report, that Slaves are &s;everely beaten there, (which is very pro|bable in a Country where free per&s;ons are &s;o rigidly ba&s;tinado'd) yet the Slavery there is &s;o gentile, or, if you will, the Liberty is &s;o abject, that it is become a Proverb, that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> &s;ell it to eat of a Fruit, which they call <HI>Durions.</HI> I have already &s;aid, that they chu&s;e rather to enjoy it, than to enjoy none at all: 'Tis certain al&s;o, that they dread Beggary more than Slavery; and this makes me to think, that Beggary is there as painful as ignominious, and that the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> who expre&s;s a great deal of Charity for Bea&s;ts, even to the reliev|ing them, if they find any &s;ick in the Fields, have very little for the Men.</P>
<P>They employ their Slaves in cultivating their Lands and Gardens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what the Slaves are employed.</NOTE> and in &s;ome dome&s;tic Services; or rather, they permit them to work to gain their livelihood, under a Tribute which they receive, from four to eight <HI>Ticals</HI> a Year, that is to &s;ay, from &s;even Livres ten Sols, to fifteen Livres.</P>
<P>One may be born, or become a Slave. One becomes &s;o either for Debt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> may be born, or become a Slave.</NOTE> as I have &s;aid, or for having been taken Captive in War, or for having been con|fi&s;cated by Ju&s;tice. When one is made a Slave for Debt, his Liberty returns again by making &s;atisfaction; but the Children born during this Slavery, tho' it be but for a time, continue Slaves.</P>
<P>One is born a Slave, when born of a Mother-&s;lave; and in the Slavery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How he is born a Slave, and to whom he belongs.</NOTE> the Children are divided as in the Divorce. The fir&s;t, third, fifth, and all the re&s;t in the odd number belong to the Ma&s;ter of the Mother: the &s;econd, fourth, and all the others in the even rank belong to the Father, if he is free; or to his Ma&s;ter, if he is a Slave. 'Tis true, that it is nece&s;&s;ary upon this account, that the Father and Mother &s;hould have had Commerce together, with the con&s;ent of the Ma&s;ter of the Mother: for otherwi&s;e all the Children would belong to the Ma&s;ter of the Mother.</P>
<P>The difference of the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Slaves from his Subjects of free condi|tion, is, that he continually employs his Slaves in per&s;onal labours,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The difference between the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Slaves, and his other Subjects.

<P>In a word, the Slaves of particular men owe not any &s;ervice to that Prince; and tho' for this Rea&s;on he lo&s;es a Freeman, when this man falls into &s;lavery, ei|ther for Debt, or to avoid Beggary, yet this Prince oppo&s;es it not, neither pre|tends any Indemnity upon this account.</P>
<P>Properly &s;peaking, there is not two &s;orts of Conditions among free per&s;ons. Nobility is no other thing than the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Offices, the Families
<PB N="78" REF="50">
which do long maintain them&s;elves therein, do become doubtle&s;s more illu&s;tri|ous and more powerful; but they are rare: and &s;o &s;oon as they have lo&s;t their Offices, they have nothing, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from the common People. There is frequently &s;een at the <HI>Pagaye,</HI> the Grand&s;on of a Man who died a great Lord, and &s;ometimes his own Son.</P>

The Lords of the Great <HI>Mo|guls</HI> Court are called, according to <HI>Bernier, Hazary, Dou-hazary, Penge, hecht,</HI> and <HI>Deh-hazary,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>One Thou&s;and, Two Thou&s;and, Five, Eight,</HI> and <HI>Ten Thou&s;and,</HI> as if one &s;hould &s;ay, Lords over &s;o many Thou&s;ands of Hor&s;e: though in reality they could neither maintain, nor command &s;o great a number. The great <HI>Moguls</HI> elde&s;t Son, he &s;ays, is called <HI>Twelve Thou&s;and,</HI> as if he had the effective command of Twelve Thou&s;and Hor&s;e. 'Tis no &s;trange thing there|fore that the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Subjects being e&s;teemed Soldiers, as tho&s;e of the Great <HI>Mogul</HI> are e&s;teemed Hor&s;emen, have equally a&s;&s;umed in both Courts the term of number, to expre&s;s the highe&s;t Dignities, and to name the Princes them|&s;elves; yet I cannot affirm this is &s;o at <HI>Siam,</HI> by rea&s;on that I know only that the words <HI>Pang</HI> and <HI>Meuing</HI> are <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> and numeral Terms: but as to the other names of Dignity, which I have mentioned, &s;ome have informed me that they are <HI>Balie,</HI> and that they under&s;tood them not. I know that in the Country of <HI>Laos</HI> the Dignities of <HI>Pa-ya</HI> and <HI>Meuang,</HI> and the honourable Epithets of <HI>Pra</HI> are in u&s;e; it may be al&s;o that the other Terms of Dignity are common to both Nations, as well as the Laws.</P>
<P>In reference to the &s;ix Dignities (for that of <HI>Oc-pan</HI> is ob&s;olete,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Six orders of Cities of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE> as I have &s;aid) there are now at <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ix Orders of Cities, which have been anciently determi|ned according to the Rolls of the Inhabitants. So that &s;uch a City, which was then found very populous had a <HI>Pa ya</HI> for Governor, and &s;uch which was le&s;s
<PB N="80" REF="51">
populous had an <HI>Oc-ya,</HI> and the re&s;t had al&s;o other Dignities in proportion to the Inhabitants which they contained. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to believe that the&s;e Cities have ever been &s;o populous as the Titles of their Governors import; by rea&s;on, as I have often alledged, that the&s;e People are very proud in Titles. On|ly the greate&s;t Titles were given to the Governors of the bigge&s;t Cities, and the lea&s;t Titles to the Governors of the Cities le&s;s inhabited. Thus the City of <HI>Me-Tac,</HI> of which I have &s;poken at the beginning, had a Governor called <HI>Pa-ya-Tac,</HI> and the word <HI>Me</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Mother,</HI> and which is joyned to <HI>Tac,</HI> &s;eems to intimate that the City of <HI>Me-Tac</HI> was very great. The City of <HI>Por&s;elouc</HI> had al&s;o a <HI>Pa-ya; Tena&s;&s;erim, Ligor, Corazema</HI> and other, have &s;till &s;ome <HI>Oc-ya.</HI> Le&s;&s;er Cities, as <HI>Pipeli</HI> and <HI>Bancock,</HI> have the <HI>Oc-pra,</HI> others have the <HI>Oc-Louang,</HI> or the <HI>Oc-Counnes,</HI> and the lea&s;t of all have the <HI>Oc-Meuing.</HI> The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have tran&s;lated the&s;e Titles according to their fancy by tho&s;e of <HI>King, Vice-Roy, Duke, Marquis, Earl,</HI> &amp;c. They have given the Title of Kingdom to <HI>Metac, Tena&s;&s;a|rim, Por&s;elouc, Ligor,</HI> and <HI>Pipeli;</HI> either by rea&s;on of their hereditary Gover|nours, or for having been like <HI>Pipeli</HI> the re&s;idence of the Kings of <HI>Siam;</HI> and to the Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> they have given the Title of Emperor, becau&s;e the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> have ever thought the Title of Emperor ought to be given to Kings, that have other Kings for Feudataries: So that upon this &s;ingle rea&s;on &s;ome Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> have born the Title of Emperor, giving to their Children the Title of Kings of the &s;everal Kingdoms which were united to their Crown.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dignities of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are not annext to the &s;ingle Governments of City or Pro|vince.</NOTE>To return to the Titles of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> they are given not only to the Go|vernors, but to all the Officers of the Kingdom; becau&s;e that they are all <HI>Nai:</HI> and the &s;ame Title is not always joyned to the &s;ame Office. The <HI>Barcalon,</HI> for example, has &s;ometimes had that of <HI>Pa-ya,</HI> as &s;ome have informed me, and now he has only that of <HI>Oc-ya.</HI> But if a Man has two Offices, he may have two different Titles in re&s;pect to his two Offices: and it is not rare that one Man has two Offices, one in the City and the other in the Province, or rather one in Title and the other by Commi&s;&s;ion. Thus <HI>Oc-ya Pra-Sedet</HI> who is Governor of the City of <HI>Siam</HI> in Title, is now <HI>Oc-ya Barcalon</HI> by Commi&s;&s;ion: the King of <HI>Siam</HI> finding it his intere&s;t, becau&s;e that upon this account he gives not to one Officer a double Sallery.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Equivo|cations which this cau&s;es in Relations.</NOTE>But this Multiplication of Offices on the &s;ame Head cau&s;es a great deal of Ob&s;curity and Equivocation in the ancient Relations of <HI>Siam;</HI> becau&s;e that when a man has two Offices, he has two Titles, and two Names, and when the Re|lation imports that &s;uch an <HI>Oc-ya</HI> for example, is concerned in &s;uch a thing, one is inclined to believe that the Relation has &s;til'd this <HI>Oc-ya</HI> by the title of the function which it attributes to him, and frequently it has named him by the title of another Office. Thus if a Relation of the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> made by a <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> &s;hould intimate, that the Duke of <HI>Mayne</HI> is General of the <HI>Sui&s;&s;es,</HI> the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> might groundle&s;ly per&s;wade them&s;elves, that every General of the <HI>Sui&s;&s;es</HI> bears the Title of Duke of <HI>Mayne.</HI> And this is what I had to &s;ay touching the People of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>

Navaret|te,</HI> whom I have already cited, is of this opinion; and we may confirm it, becau&s;e that the <HI>Arabian</HI> word <HI>Emir,</HI> which is u&s;ed at the Court of the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and in &s;everal other Mahometan Courts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> to &s;ignifie the Officers, is derived from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Verb <HI>amara,</HI> which &s;ignifies to <HI>command.</HI> The word <HI>Manda|rin</HI>

<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> therefore makes no con&s;iderable <HI>Mandarin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Siam</HI> gives Names to the con&s;iderable <HI>Mandarins.</HI></NOTE> but he gives him a new Name; a Cu&s;tom e&s;tabli&s;hed al&s;o at <HI>China,</HI> and in other States of the Ea&s;t. This Name is always an <HI>Elogium;</HI> &s;ometimes it is purpo&s;ely invented, like that which he gave to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metelpolis,</HI> and like tho&s;e which he gives to the Forreigners that are at his Court; but oftentimes the&s;e Names are ancient, and known for having been formerly given to others; and tho&s;e are the mo&s;t honourable, which have been heretofore born by per&s;ons very highly advanced in Dignity, or by the Princes of the Royal Blood. And although &s;uch Names be not always accompanied with Offices and Authority, they cea&s;e not to be a great Mark of Favour. It likewi&s;e happens that the &s;ame Name is given to &s;everal per&s;ons of different Dignities; &s;o that at the &s;ame time the one, for example, will call him&s;elf, <HI>Oc-Pra Pipitcharatcha,</HI> and the other <HI>Oc-Counne Pipitcharatcha.</HI> The&s;e Names, of which the fir&s;t words are only &s;poken, and which do every one make a Period, are taken almo&s;t all entire out of the <HI>Baly</HI> Tongue, and are not always well under&s;tood: But this, and the Stile of the Laws, which participate very much of the <HI>Baly,</HI> and the Books of Religion, which are <HI>Baly,</HI> are the cau&s;e why the Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> ought not to ignore this Tongue. Fora&s;much as, I have el&s;ewhere &s;aid, it lends all its Ornaments to the <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> and that oftentimes they do elegantly intermix them, either in &s;peak|ing or in writing.</P>
<P>The Law of the State is, that all Offices &s;hould be hereditary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">All Offices are hereditary.</NOTE> and the &s;ame Law is in the Kingdom of <HI>Laos,</HI> and was anciently at <HI>China.</HI> But the &s;elling of Offices is not there permitted: and moreover the lea&s;t fault of the Patent, or the capricious Humor of the Prince, or the Dotage of the Inheritor may take away the Offices from the Families, and when this happens it is always without Recompence. Very few Families do long maintain them&s;elves therein, e&s;pe|cially in the Offices of the Court, which are more than the re&s;t under the Ma|&s;ter's power.</P>
<P>Moreover, no Officer at <HI>Siam</HI> has any Sallary. The Prince lodges them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Profits of the Offices.</NOTE>
which is no great matter; and gives them &s;ome moveables, as Boxes of Glod or Silver for <HI>Betel;</HI> &s;ome Arms, and a <HI>Balon;</HI> &s;ome Bea&s;ts, as Elephants, Hor&s;es, and Buffalo's; &s;ome Services, Slaves, and in fine &s;ome Arable Lands. All which return to the King with the Office, and which do principally make the King to be the Heir of his Officers. But the principal gain of the Offices con&s;i&s;ts in Extor&s;ions, becau&s;e that in this there is no Ju&s;tice for the weak. All the Officers do hold a corre&s;pondence in pillaging; and the Corruption is greate&s;t in tho&s;e from whence the Remedy ought to come. The Trade of Pre|&s;ents is publick; the lea&s;t Officers do give unto the greate&s;t, under a Title of Re&s;pect; and a Judge is not there puni&s;hed for having received Pre&s;ents, if otherwi&s;e he be not convicted of Inju&s;tice, which is not very ea&s;ie to do.</P>
<P>The Form of the Oath of Fidelity con&s;i&s;ts in &s;wallowing the water,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oath of Fidelity.</NOTE> over which the <HI>Talapoins</HI> do pronounce &s;ome Imprecations again&s;t him, who is to drink it, in ca&s;e he fails in the Fidelity which he owes to his King. This Prince di&s;pen&s;es not with this Oath to any per&s;ons that engage them&s;elves in his Service, of what Religion or Nation &s;oever.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Divi&s;ion of the King|dom of <HI>Siam</HI> by Provinces.</NOTE>THE Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> is divided into the upper and lower. The upper lies towards the North, (&s;eeing that the River de&s;cends from thence) and contains &s;even Provinces, which are named by their Chief Cities, <HI>Por&s;elouc, San|quelouc, Lacontai, Campeng-pet, Coconrepina, Pechebonne,</HI> and <HI>Pitchai.</HI> At <HI>Por&s;elouc</HI> do immediately ari&s;e ten Juri&s;dictions, at <HI>Sanquelouc</HI> eight, at <HI>Lacontai</HI> &s;even, at <HI>Campeng-pet</HI> ten, at <HI>Coconrepina</HI> five, at <HI>Pechebonne</HI> two, and at <HI>Pitchai</HI> &s;even.

But the mo&s;t important prerogative of the Pre&s;ident is to be the Governour of his whole Ju|ri&s;diction, and to command even the Garri&s;ons, if there be any; unle&s;s the Prince hath otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed thereof by an expre&s;s order. So that as in other places the&s;e Offices are hereditary, it is no difficult matter for &s;ome of the&s;e Governors, and e&s;pecially the mo&s;t powerful, and for the mo&s;t remote from Court, to withdraw them&s;elves wholly or in part from the Royal Autho|rity.</P>

<P>But as the whole People of the Juri&s;diction is divided by Bands, and that their principal <HI>Nai</HI> are the Officers of the Tribunal, whom I &s;hall call by the general name of Councellors; in ca&s;e of proce&s;s the Plaintiff goes fir&s;t to the Councellor who is his <HI>Nai,</HI> or to his Country <HI>Nai,</HI> who goes to the Councellor <HI>Nai.</HI> He pre&s;ents him his Petition, and the Councellor pre&s;ents it to the Governor.

<P><PB N="86" REF="54"><NOTE PLACE="marg">How a Pro|ce&s;s is prepa|red at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>The Governor then admits the Petition, and refers it to one of the Councel|lors; and ordinarily he returns it to him that pre&s;ented it, if he is the common <HI>Nai</HI> of both parties: but then he puts his Seal thereunto, and he counts the lines and the cancelling thereof, to the end that no alteration may be made. The Councellor gives it to his Deputy and to his Clerk, who make their report to him at his Hou&s;e in his Hall of Audience: And this report, and all tho&s;e which I &s;hall treat of in the &s;equel, are only a Lecture. After this the Councellor's Clerk pre&s;ented by his Ma&s;ter, reports or reads this very Petition, in the Go|vernour's Hall, at an A&s;&s;embly of all the Councellors; but in the ab&s;ence of the Governor, who vouch&s;afes not to appear at whatever &s;erves only to prepare the Cau&s;e. The Parties are there called in under pretence of endeavouring to reconcile them: and they are &s;ummon'd three times, more for fa&s;hions &s;ake, than with a &s;incere intention of procuring the accommodation. This Reconci|liation not &s;ucceeding, the Court orders, if there are witne&s;&s;es, that they &s;hould be heard before the &s;ame Clerk, unle&s;s he be declared &s;u&s;pected. And in &s;uch another Se&s;&s;ion, that is to &s;ay, where the Governor is not pre&s;ent, the Clerk reads the Proce&s;s and the depo&s;itions of the Witne&s;&s;es, and they proceed to the Opinions, which are only con&s;ultative, and which are all writ down, begin|ning with the Opinion of the la&s;t Officer.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proof of the Fire.</NOTE>In the Proof of Fire they erect a Pile of Faggots in a Ditch, in &s;uch a manner that the &s;urface of the Pile be level with the edge of the Ditch. This Pile is five fathomslong, and one broad. Both the parties do walk with their naked Feet from one end to the other, and he that has not the &s;ole of his Feet hurt gains his Suit. But as they are accu&s;tomed to go with naked Feet, and that they have the &s;ole of the Foot hard like Horn, they &s;ay that it is very common that the Fire &s;pares them, provided they re&s;t the Foot upon the Coals: for the way to burn them&s;elves is to go quick and lightly. Two men do generally walk by the &s;ide of him that pa&s;&s;es over the Fire, and they lean with force upon his Shoulders, to hinder him from getting too quick over this proof: and it is &s;aid that this weight is &s;o far from expo&s;ing him more to be burnt, that on the contrary he &s;tifles the Action of the Fire under his Feet.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="54">Sometimes the proof of the Fire is performed with Oil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Another &s;ort of Proof by Fire.</NOTE> or other boiling matter, into which the parties do thru&s;t their hand.

<P>The Proof of the Water is performed after this manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Proof of the Water.</NOTE> The two parties do plunge them&s;elves into the Water at the &s;ame time, each holding by a Pole, along which they de&s;cend; and he that remains longe&s;t under Water is thought to have a good Cau&s;e. Every one therefore practi&s;es from their Youth, in this Country, to familiarize him&s;elf with Fire, and to continue a long time under Water.</P>
<P>They have another &s;ort of Proof,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Proof by Vomits.</NOTE> which is performed by certain Pills prepa|red by the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> and accompanied with Imprecations: Both the parties do &s;wallow them, and the token of the right Cau&s;e is to be able to keep them in the Stomach without ca&s;ting them up, for they are vomitive.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Proofs are not only before the Judges, but before the People,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The various &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the&s;e Proofs.</NOTE> and if the two parties do e&s;cape equally well, or equally ill with one, they have re|cour&s;e to another Tryal.

But if the Tygers devour them both, they are both e&s;teemed guilty. If on the contrary the Tygers do meddle neither with the one nor the other, they have recour&s;e to &s;ome other Proof, or rather they wait till the Tygers determine to devour one or both of the Parties. The Con&s;tancy with which it is reported that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do un|dergo this kind of death, is incredible in per&s;ons, who expre&s;s &s;o little Cou|rage in War.</P>

But if the King of <HI>Siam</HI> grants other Commi&s;&s;ions for his Service, or for the Service of the State, it is rare that he exempts the Commi&s;&s;ioner from taking the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Governor of the places where he &s;ends him.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual Puni&s;hment of Robbery is the Condemnation to the double,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Puni&s;h|ment of Rob|bery extended to E&s;tates.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes to the triple; by equal portions to the Judge and Party: But it is mo&s;t &s;ingular in this, that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> extend the Puni&s;hment of Robbery to every unju&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or in a Real E&s;tate: So that whoever it evicted out of an Inheritance by Law, not only re&s;tores the Inheritance to the Party, but likewi&s;e pays the value thereof, half to the Party, and half to the Judge. But if by the King's &s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion the Judge can put the Robber to death, then he can at his own di&s;cretion order either Death, or the pecuniary Mulct, but not Death and the pecuniary Mulct together.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> Concerning the Art of War among&s;t the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> and of their Forces by Sea and Land.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> not proper for War.</NOTE>THe Art of War is exceedingly ignor'd at <HI>Siam:</HI> the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are little in|clined to this Trade. The over-quick imagination of the exce&s;&s;ive hot Countries, is not more proper for Courage, than the &s;low imagination of Countries extreamly cold. The &s;ight of a naked Sword is &s;ufficient to put an hundred <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> to flight; there needs only the a&s;&s;ured Tone of an <HI>European,</HI> that wears a Sword at his &s;ide, or a Cane in his hand, to make them forget the mo&s;t expre&s;s Orders of their Superiors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How con|temptible the men in the <HI>In|dies</HI> are as to their Courage.</NOTE>I &s;ay moreover, that every one born in the <HI>Indies</HI> is without Courage; al|though he be born of <HI>European</HI> Parents. And the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> born in the <HI>Indies</HI> have been a real proof thereof. A &s;ociety of <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants found in them only the Name and the Language, and not the Bravery of the <HI>Portugue&s;e:</HI> and if other <HI>Europeans</HI> went to &s;eek out the <HI>Dutch,</HI> they would not be found more Valorous. The be&s;t con&s;tituted men are tho&s;e of the Temperate Zones: and among&s;t the&s;e the difference of their common aliments, and of the places which they inhabit, more or le&s;s hot, dry or moi&s;t, expo&s;ed to the Winds or to the Seas, Plains or Mountains. Woods or Champains, and much more the &s;everal Governments do cau&s;e very great differences. For who doubts, for example, that the Antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> brought up in liberty, where incomparably more Va|lorous then the pre&s;ent <HI>Greeks,</HI> depre&s;&s;ed by &s;o long a Servitude? All the&s;e rea|&s;ons do concur to effeminate the Courage of the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> I mean the heat of the Climate, the flegmatick Aliments, and the De&s;potick Government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> abhor blood.</NOTE>The Opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> in&s;piring them with an horror of blood, deprives them likewi&s;e of the Spirit of War. They bu&s;ie them&s;elves only in making Slaves. If the <HI>Peguins,</HI> for example, do on one &s;ide invade the lands of <HI>Siam,</HI> the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> will at another place enter on the Lands of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and both Parties will carry away whole Villages into Captivity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How in fight|ing they di&s;|gui&s;e the de|&s;ign of killing their Enemies.</NOTE>But if the Armies meet, they will not &s;hoot directly one again&s;t the other, but higher: and yet as they endeavour to make the&s;e random Shots to fall back upon the Enemies, to the end that they may be overtaken therewith, if they do not retreat, one of the two Parties do's not long defer from taking flight, upon perceiving it never &s;o little to rain Darts or Bullets. But if the de&s;ign be to &s;top the Troops that come upon them, they will &s;hoot lower than it is nece&s;|&s;ary; to the end that if the Enemies approach, the fault may be their own in coming within the reach of being wounded or &s;lain. <HI>Kill not</HI> is the order, which the King of <HI>Siam</HI> gives his Troops, when he &s;ends them into the Field: which cannot &s;ignifie that they &s;hould not kill ab&s;olutely, but that they &s;hoot not directly upon the Enemy.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King of <HI>Singor</HI> was taken by a Frenchman.</NOTE>Some have upon this account informed me a thing, which in my opinion, will appear mo&s;t incredible. 'Tis of a provincial named <HI>Cyprian,</HI> who is &s;till at <HI>Surat</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> Company's Service, if he has not quitted it, or if he is not lately dead: the name of his Family I know not. Before his entrance into the Companies &s;ervice, he had &s;erved &s;ome time in the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Army in quality of Canoneer; and becau&s;e he was prohibited from &s;hooting &s;trait, he doubted not that the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> General would betray the King his Ma&s;ter.

He took him indeed, and brought him to the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> General, and &s;o terminated a War of above twenty years. The King
<PB N="91" REF="56">
of <HI>Siam</HI> intended to recompence this &s;ervice of <HI>Cyprian</HI> with a quantity of <HI>Sapan</HI>-wood; but by &s;ome intrigue of Court he got nothing, and retir'd to <HI>Surat.</HI></P>
<P>Now though the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> appear to us &s;o little proper for War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have little to fear from their Neighbours. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> has no o|ther Troops maintain'd than his fo|reign Guard.</NOTE> yet they cea&s;e not to make it frequently and advantageou&s;ly, by rea&s;on that their Neigh|bours are neither more potent nor more valiant than them.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> has no other Troops maintained than his foreign Guard, of which I will &s;peak in the &s;equel. 'Tis true that the Chevalier <HI>de Fourbin</HI> had &s;howed the Exerci&s;e of Arms to four hundred <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> which we found at <HI>Bancock:</HI> and that after he had quitted this Kingdom, an Engli&s;hman, who had been a Sergeant in the Garri&s;on of <HI>Madra&s;patan,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> &s;howed this &s;ame exerci&s;e, which he had learnt under the Chevalier <HI>de Fourbin,</HI> to about eight hundred other <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> to &s;how the King of <HI>Siam</HI> that the Che|valier <HI>de Fourbin</HI> was not nece&s;&s;ary to him. But all the&s;e Soldiers have no other pay, than the Exemption from the &s;ix Months Service for &s;ome of their Family. And as they cannot ea&s;ily maintain them&s;elves from their own Hou&s;es, by rea|&s;on they receive no money, they remain at their own Habitations; the four hundred about <HI>Bancock,</HI> and the other eight hundred at <HI>Louvo,</HI> or thereabouts. Only for the &s;ecurity of <HI>Bancock</HI> &s;ome Detachments went thither by turns to keep a continual Guard, and the re&s;t being thereabouts might render them&s;elves in ca&s;e of an Alarm. But according to the common practice of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> the Garri&s;ons which it may have, are compo&s;ed of per&s;ons, who &s;erve in this by &s;ix Months, as they &s;hould &s;erve in another thing; and who are re|lieved by others when they have &s;erved their full time.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> being very &s;trong by its impenetaable Woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Country of <HI>Siam</HI> is very &s;trong without Forts.</NOTE> and by the great number of Channels, wherewith it is inter&s;per&s;ed, and in fine by the annual Innundation of &s;ix Months, the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> would not hitherto have places well fortified for fear of lo&s;ing them, and not being able to retake them; and this is the rea&s;on they gave me thereof. The Ca&s;tles they have would hardly &s;u&s;tain the fir&s;t &s;hock of our Soldiers; and though they be &s;mall and ugly, becau&s;e they would have them &s;uch, yet is it nece&s;&s;ary to employ the skill of the <HI>Euro|peans</HI> to delineate them.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ome years &s;ince the King of <HI>Siam</HI> de&s;igning to make a wooden Fort on the Frontier of <HI>Pegu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> know not how to make a wooden Fort.</NOTE> had no abler a per&s;on to whom he could entru&s;t the care thereof, than to one named Brother <HI>Rene Charbonneau,</HI> who after having been a Servant of the Mi&s;&s;ion of S^t. <HI>Lazarus</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed to the Service of the Foreign Mi&s;&s;ions, and was gone to <HI>Siam.</HI> Brother <HI>Rene,</HI> who by his Indu&s;try knew how to let blood, and give a Remedy to a &s;ick Per&s;on (for it is by &s;uch like charitable Employments, and by &s;ome pre&s;ents, that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries are permitted and loved in this Country) defended him&s;elf as much as he could from making this Fort, prote&s;ting that he was not capable: but in &s;hort he could not prevent rendering obedience, when it was &s;ignified to him that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> ab&s;olutely requir'd it. He was afterwards three or four years Governor of <HI>Jon&s;alam</HI> by Commi&s;&s;ion, and with great approbation: and becau&s;e he de&s;ired to return to the City of <HI>Siam</HI> to his Wife's Relations, which are <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> Mr. <HI>Billi,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of Mr. <HI>de Chaumont</HI>'s Palace, &s;ucceeded him in the Em|ployment of <HI>Jon&s;alam.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have not much Artillery.

<P>As they have no Hor&s;es (for what is two thou&s;and Hor&s;e at mo&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In what their Armies con&s;i&s;t.</NOTE> which 'tis reported that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> keeps?) their Armies con&s;i&s;t only in Elephants, and in Infantry, naked and ill armed, after the mode of the Country.

<P>They range them&s;elves in three lines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is their order of battle and of their Encampments.</NOTE> each of which is compo&s;ed of three great &s;quare Battalions; and the King, or the General whom he names in his ab&s;ence, &s;tands in the middle Battalion, which he compo&s;es of the be&s;t Troops, for the &s;ecurity of his Per&s;on. Every particular Captain of a Battalion keeps him&s;elf al&s;o in the mid&s;t of the Battalion which he commands: and if the nine
<PB N="92" REF="57">

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephants of War.</NOTE>The Army being thus ranged, every one of the nine Battalions has &s;ix|teen male Elephants in the rear. They call them Elephants of War: and each of the&s;e Elephants carries his particular &s;tandard, and is accompanied with two female Elephants; but as well females as males are mounted each with three armed Men; and be&s;ides this the Army has &s;ome Elephants with Baggage. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> report that the female Elephants are only for the dignity of the males; but as I have already declared in the other part, it would be very difficult al|ways to govern the males without the Company of the females.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Artillery begins the Fight.</NOTE>The Artillery, at the places where the River grows &s;hallow, is carried on Waggons drawn by Buffalo's, or Oxen, for it has no carriage. It begins the Fight, and if it ends it not, then they place them&s;elves within reach to make u&s;e of the &s;mall &s;hot, and Arrows, after the manner as I have explained, but they never fall on with vigour enough, nor defend them&s;elves with con&s;tancy enough, to come to a clo&s;e Fight.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> ea&s;ie to break, and to rally.</NOTE>They break them&s;elves and fly into Woods, but ordinarily they rally with the &s;ame facility. as they are broken; and if on &s;ome occa&s;ion, as in the la&s;t Con&s;piracy of the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars,</HI> it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;tand firm, they can promi&s;e them&s;elves to retain the Soldiers, only by placing &s;ome Officers behind, to kill tho&s;e that &s;hall fly. I have el&s;ewhere related how the&s;e <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars</HI> made u&s;e of Opium to endow them&s;elves with Courage: 'tis a cu&s;tom practi&s;ed prin|cipally by the <HI>Ragipouts,</HI> and the <HI>Melays,</HI> but not by the <HI>Siame&s;es:</HI> the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> would be afraid to become too Couragious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Elephants not proper for War.</NOTE>They very much rely upon the Elephants in Combats, though this Animal for want of Bitt or Bridle, cannot be &s;ecurely governed, and he frequently re|turns upon his own Ma&s;ters when he is wounded. Moreover he &s;o exceeding|ly dreads the fire, that he is never almo&s;t accu&s;tomed thereunto. Yet they ex|erci&s;e them to carry, and to &s;ee fired from their back little pieces about three foot long, and about a pound of Ball; and <HI>Bernier</HI> reports that this very practice is ob&s;erved in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Country.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> incapable of Sieges.</NOTE>As for Sieges they are wholly incapable thereof, for men that dare not &s;et up|on the Enemies when in view, will not vigorou&s;ly attack a place never &s;o little Fortified, but only by Treachery, in which they are very cunning, or by Fa|mine, if the Be&s;ieged cannot have provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their weak|ne&s;s by Sea.</NOTE>They are yet more &s;eeble by Sea than by Land.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the White Elephant.</NOTE>The&s;e People have naturally &s;o great an e&s;teem of Elephants, that they are per&s;waded that an Animal &s;o noble, &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o docile, can be animated only with an illu&s;trious Soul, which has formerly been in the body of &s;ome Prince, or of &s;ome great Per&s;on: but they have yet a much higher Idea of the White Elephants. The&s;e Animals are rare, and are found, &s;ay they, only in the Woods of <HI>Siam.</HI> They are not altogether White, but of a fle&s;h colour, and for this rea&s;on it is that <HI>Vliet</HI> in the Title of his Relation has &s;aid, the White and Red Elephant. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call this colour <HI>Peuak,</HI> and I doubt not that it is this colour inclining to White and moreover &s;o rare in this Animal, which has procur'd it the Veneration of tho&s;e People to &s;uch a degree, as to per&s;wade them what they report thereof, that a Soul of &s;ome Prince is always lodged in the body of a White Elephant, whether Male or Female it matters not.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The E&s;teem which the <HI>Si|ame&s;es</HI> do make of the White colour in Ani|mals.</NOTE>By the &s;ame rea&s;on of the colour, White Hor&s;es are tho&s;e which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> mo&s;t e&s;teem. I proceed to give a proof thereof. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> having one of his Hor&s;es &s;ick, intreated M^r. <HI>Vincent,</HI> that Phy&s;ician which I have frequently mentioned, to pre&s;cribe him &s;ome Remedy. And to per&s;wade him to it (for he well knew that the <HI>European</HI> Phy&s;icians deba&s;ed not them&s;elves to meddle with Bea&s;ts) he acquainted him that the Hor&s;e was <HI>Mogol</HI> (that is to &s;ay White) of four races by Sire and Dam, without any mixture of <HI>Indian</HI> blood; and that had it not been for this con&s;ideration he would not have made him this re|que&s;t. The <HI>Indians</HI> call the White, <HI>Mogols,</HI> which they di&s;tingui&s;h into <HI>Mogols</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Mogols</HI> of <HI>Europe.</HI> Therefore whence &s;oever this re&s;pect is for the White colour, as well in Men as in Bea&s;ts, I could di&s;cover no other rea&s;on at <HI>Siam,</HI> than that of the veneration which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have for the White Elephants. Next to the White they mo&s;t e&s;teem tho&s;e which are quite Black, becau&s;e they are likewi&s;e very rare; and they Dye &s;ome of this colour, when they are not naturally Black enough. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> always keeps a White Elephant in his Palace, which is treated like the King of all tho&s;e Elephants, which this Prince maintains. That which Mr. <HI>de Chaumont</HI> &s;aw in this Country, was dead, as I have &s;aid, when we arrived there. There was born another as they report|ed on the 9^t^h of <HI>December</HI> 1687. a few days before our departure: but this Ele|phant was &s;till in the Woods, and received no Vi&s;it, and &s;o we &s;aw no White Elephant.

<P>IN the <HI>Vang</HI> are &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;ingle Halls which I have de&s;cribed;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>In what place of the Palace the Courtiers wait.</P>
<P>How the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;hows him&s;elf to them.</P></NOTE> in which the Officers do meet, either for their Functions, or to make their Court, or to wait the Orders of the Prince.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual place were he &s;hows him&s;elf unto them, is the Hall, where he gave Audience to the King's Amba&s;&s;adors; and he &s;hows him&s;elf only through a Window, as did antiently the King of <HI>China.</HI> This Window is from a higher Chamber, which has this pro&s;pect over the Hall, and which may be &s;aid to be of the fir&s;t Story. It is nine Foot high or thereabouts; and it was nece&s;&s;ary to place three &s;teps underneath, to rai&s;e me high enough to pre&s;ent the King's Letter to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI> This Prince cho&s;e rather to cau&s;e the&s;e three &s;teps to be put, than to &s;ee him&s;elf again obliged to &s;toop, to take the King's Letter from my hand, as he had been obliged to do, to take that which Mr. <HI>de Chau|mont</HI> deliver'd him. 'Tis evident by the Relation of Mr. <HI>de Chaumont,</HI> that he had in his hands a kind of Gold Cup, which had a very long handle of the &s;ame matter; to the end that he might u&s;e it to give the King's Letter to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI> He did it, but he would not take this Cup by the handle to rai&s;e the Letter; &s;o that it was nece&s;&s;ary that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;hould &s;toop out of the Window to receive it. 'Tis with the &s;ame Cup, that the Officers of this Prince deliver him every thing that he receives from their hands. At the two Corners of the Hall which are at the &s;ides of this Window, are two doors about the heighth of the Windows, and two pair of very narrow Stairs to a&s;cend. For the Furniture there is only three <HI>&V;mbrella's,</HI> one before the Win|dow with nine rounds, and two with &s;even rounds on both &s;ides of the Win|dow. The <HI>&V;mbrella</HI> is in this Country as the <HI>Daiz</HI> or Canopy is in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis in this Hall that the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Officers, which if you plea&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Pages.</NOTE> may be named from his Chamber, or rather his Anti-chamber, do expect his Orders. He has Forty four young men, the olde&s;t of which hardly exceeds twenty five years of Age: the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call them <HI>Mahatlek,</HI> the <HI>Europeans</HI> have called them <HI>Pages.</HI> The&s;e Forty four Pages therefore are divided into four Bands, each con&s;i&s;ting of eleven: the two fir&s;t are on the right hand, and do pro&s;trare them|&s;elves in the Hall at the King's right hand; the two others are on the left hand, and do pro&s;trate them&s;elves on the left hand. This Prince gives them every one a Name and a Sabre; and they carry his Orders to the Pages without, which are numerous, and which have no Name, that is impo&s;ed on them by the King. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call them <HI>Caloang,</HI> and 'tis the&s;e <HI>Caloangs</HI> that the King ordinarily &s;ends into the Provinces upon Commi&s;&s;ions, whether ordinary, or extraordinary.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this the Forty four Pages within have their Functions regulated: Some,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Functi|ons.</NOTE> for example, do &s;erve Betel to the King, others take care of his Arms, others do keep his Books, and when he plea&s;es they read in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>This Prince is curious to the highe&s;t degree.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King of <HI>Siam</HI> loves Reading.</NOTE> He cau&s;ed <HI>Q.

He under&s;tands the States of <HI>Europe;</HI> and I doubt not thereof, becau&s;e that once, as he gave me occa&s;ion to inform him that the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> is Elective, he asked me whether be&s;ides the Empire and

<HI>Poland,</HI> there was any other Elective State in <HI>Europe?</HI> And I heard him pro|nounce the word <HI>Polonia,</HI> of which I had not &s;poken to him. Some have a&s;|&s;ur'd me that he has frequently a&s;&s;erted, that the Art of Ruling is not in&s;pired, and that with great Experience and Reading he perceived that he was not yet perfect in under&s;tanding it. But he de&s;ign'd principally to &s;tudy it from the Hi&s;tory of the King: he is de&s;irous of all the News from <HI>France;</HI> and &s;o &s;oon as his Amba&s;&s;adors were arrived, he retain'd the third with him, until he had read their Relation to him from one end to the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Officers which com|mand the Pa|ges within.</NOTE>To return to the Forty-four Pages, Four Officers command them; who, be|cau&s;e they &s;o nearly approach the Prince, are in great e&s;teem, but yet not in an equal degree: for there is a great difference from the fir&s;t to the &s;econd, from the &s;econd to the third, and from the third to the fourth. They bear only the Title of <HI>Oc-Meuing,</HI> or of <HI>Pra-Meuing: Meuing Vai, Meuing Sarapet, Meuing Semeungtchai, Meuing&s;ii.</HI> The Sabres and Poniards which the King gives them are adorned with &s;ome precious Stones.

The <HI>Pa-ya,</HI> the <HI>Oc-ya,</HI> the <HI>Oc-pra,</HI> and the other Titles are not always &s;ubordinate to them, only the one mu&s;t command more per&s;ons than the other.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the &s;ingle Officer which pro&s;trates not him&s;elf before the King of <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>Whil&s;t the Amba&s;&s;adors were at Audience, there was in one place an Officer, whom we perceived not, who alone, as they informed me, has the Priviledge of not pro&s;trating him&s;elf before the King his Ma&s;ter; and this renders his Office very honourable. I forgot to write down his Title in my Memoirs. He always has his Eyes fixed upon this Prince, to receive his Orders, which he under&s;tands by certain Signs, and which he &s;ignifies by Signs to the other Officers which are without the Hall. Thus when the Audience was ended, I wou'd &s;ay when the King had done &s;peaking to us, this Prince, in that &s;ilence which is profound, gave &s;ome Signal, to which we gave no heed; and immediately at the bottom of the Hall, and in an high place, which is not vi&s;ible, was heard a tinkling Noi&s;e, like that of a Timbrel. This Noi&s;e was accompany'd with a Blow, which was ever and anon &s;truck on a Drum, which is hung up under a Pent|hou&s;e without the Hall, and which for being very great, renders its &s;ound grave and Maje&s;tie; it is cover'd with an Elephant's Skin: yet no per&s;on made any motion, till that the King, who&s;e Chair an invi&s;ible hand did by little and little draw back, removed him&s;elf from the window, and clo&s;ed the Shutters thereof; and then the Noi&s;e of the tinkling and of the great Drum cea&s;ed.</P>

They make his Bed, and dre&s;s his Meat; they cloath him, and wait on him at Table: but none but him&s;elf touches his Head when he is attir'd, nor puts any thing over his Head. The Pourveyors carry the Provi&s;ions to the Eunuchs, and they give them to the Women; and &s;he which plays the Cook, u&s;es Salt and Spices only by weight, thereby never to put in more nor le&s;s: A practice, which, in my opinion, is only a Rule of the Phy&s;icians, by rea&s;on of the King's unhealthy di&s;|po&s;ition, and not an ancient cu&s;tom of the Palace.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="61">The Women do never &s;tir out but with the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the late Queen his Wife and his Si&s;ter.</NOTE> nor the Eunuchs without expre&s;s Order. 'Tis reported that he has eight or ten Eunuchs only, as well white as black. The late Queen, who was both his Wife and his Si&s;ter, was called <HI>Nang Achamahi&s;ii.</HI> It is not ea&s;ie to know the King's Name, they care|fully and &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly conceal it, for fear le&s;t any Enchantment &s;hould be made on his Name. And others report, that their Kings have no Name till af|ter their death, and that it is their Succe&s;&s;or which names them, and this would be more certain again&s;t the pretended Sorceries.</P>
<P>Of Queen <HI>Achamahi&s;ii</HI> is born, as I have related in the other Part, the Prince&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Prin|ce&s;s his only Daughter.</NOTE> the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s only Daughter, who now has the Rank and Hou&s;e of a Queen. The King's other Wives (which in general are called <HI>Tchaou Vang,</HI> becau&s;e that the word <HI>Tchaou,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Lord,</HI> &s;ignifies likewi&s;e <HI>Lady</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;s</HI>) do render Obedience to her, and re&s;pect her as their Soveraign. They are &s;ubject to her Ju&s;tice, as well as the Women and Eunuchs which &s;erve them; becau&s;e that not being able to &s;tir out, to go plead el&s;ewhere, it nece&s;&s;arily fol|lows that the Queen &s;hould judge them, and cau&s;e them to be cha&s;ti&s;ed, to keep them in peace. This is thus practi&s;ed in all the Courts of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> but it is not true neither at <HI>Siam,</HI> nor perhaps in any part of the Ea&s;t, that the Queen has any Province to govern. 'Tis ea&s;ie al&s;o to comprehend, that if the King loves any of his Ladies more than the re&s;t, he cau&s;es her to remove from the Jea|lou&s;ie and har&s;h U&s;age of the Queen.</P>
<P>At <HI>Siam</HI> they continually take Ladies for the &s;ervice of the <HI>Vang,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Siam</HI> takes the Daughters of his Sub|jects for his Palace, when he plea&s;es.</NOTE> or to be Concubines to the King, if this Prince makes u&s;e thereof. But the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> de|liver up their Daughters only by force, becau&s;e it is never to &s;ee them again; and they redeem them &s;o long as they can for Money. So that this becomes a kind of Extortion, for they de&s;ignedly take a great many Virgins meerly to re&s;tore them to their Parents, who redeem them.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> has few Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, that is to &s;ay eight or ten in all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He has few Mini&s;tre&s;&s;es.</NOTE> not out of Continency, but Par&s;imony. I have already declared, that to have a great many Wives, is in this Country rather Magnificence, than Debauchery. Wherefore they are very much &s;urprized to hear that &s;o great a King as ours has no more than one Wife, that he had no Elephants, and that his Lands bear no Rice; as we might be, when it was told us that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> has no Hor&s;es, nor &s;tanding Forces, and that his Country bears no Corn nor Grapes, altho' all the Relations do &s;o highly extol the Riches and Power of the Kingdom of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen hath her Elephants and her Balons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queen's Hou&s;e.</NOTE> and &s;ome Officers to take care of her, and accompany her when &s;he goes abroad; but none but her Women and Eunuchs do &s;ee her. She is conceal'd from all the re&s;t of the People; and when &s;he goes out either on an Elephant, or in a Balon, it is in a Chair made up with Curtains, which permit her to &s;ee what &s;he plea&s;es, and do prevent her being &s;een: And Re&s;pect commands, that if they cannot avoid her, they &s;hould turn their back to her, by pro&s;trating them&s;elves when &s;he pa&s;&s;es along.</P>

But if the Affair &s;eems to him to merit a more mature deliberation, he makes no deci&s;ion: but after having propo&s;ed his difficulties, he commits the examination thereof to &s;ome of his Council, whom he purpo&s;ely appoints; and principally to tho&s;e who were of a different Opinion from his. They, af|ter having again con&s;ulted together, do cau&s;e the report of their new Con&s;ulta|tion to be made by one of them, in a full Council, and before the King; and hereupon this Prince con&s;ummates his Determination. Yet &s;ometimes, but very rarely, and in affairs of a cerrain Nature, he will con&s;ult the principal <HI>San|cras,</HI> which are the Superiors of the <HI>Talapoins;</HI> who&s;e credit in other matters he depre&s;&s;es as much as he can, though in appearance he honors them exceedingly. In a word, there is &s;uch a &s;ort of affairs, wherein he will call the Officers of the Provinces: but on all occa&s;ions, and in all affairs, he decides when he plea&s;es; and he is never con&s;trained to either ask advice of any per&s;on, or to follow any other advice than his own.</P>

A Gun fired, by accident or otherwi&s;e, &s;o near the Palace that the King hears it, is a capital Crime; and the noi&s;e of a Pi&s;tol be|ing heard in the Palace, a little after the Con&s;piracy of the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ars,</HI> 'twas doubted whether the King had not with this &s;hot killed one of his Brothers; becau&s;e that the King alone has power to &s;hoot, and that moreover one of his Brethren had been &s;u&s;pected of having medled in this Con&s;piracy: and this doubt was not cleared when we left <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Puni&s;hments which I have mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infamous Pu|ni&s;hments.</NOTE> they have &s;ome le&s;s do|lorous, but more infamous, as to expo&s;e a Man in a public place loaded with Irons, or with his Neck put into a kind of Ladder or Pillory, which is called <HI>Cangue,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e Ka.</HI> The two &s;ides of this Ladder are about &s;ix foot long, and are fa&s;tned to a Wall, or to Po&s;ts, each at one end, with a Cord; in&s;omuch that the Ladder may be rais'd up, and let down, as if it was fa&s;ten'd to Pullies. In the middle of the Ladder are two Steps or Rounds, between which is the Neck of the Offender, and there are no more Rounds than the&s;e two. The Offender may &s;it on the ground, or &s;tand, when the weight of the Ladder, which bears upon his Shoulders, is not too big, as it is &s;ometimes; or when the Lad|der is not fa&s;tned at the four ends: for in this la&s;t Ca&s;e it is planted in the Air, bearing at the ends upon Props, and then the Criminal is as it were hung by the Neck; he hardly touches the ground with the Tips of his Toes. Be&s;ides this, they have the u&s;e of Stocks and Manacles.</P>
<P>The Criminal is &s;ometimes in a Ditch to be lower than the ground; and this Ditch is not always broad, but oftentimes it is extremely narrow, and the Criminal, properly &s;peaking, is buried up to the Shoulders. There, for the greater Ignominy, they give him Cuffs or Blows on the Head; or they only &s;troke the hand over his Head, Affronts e&s;teemed very great, e&s;pecially if re|ceived from the hand of a Woman.</P>
<P>But what is herein very particular, is,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The &s;hame of the Puni&s;h|ments la&s;ts no longer than the Puni&s;h|ments.</P>
<P>It is attended with Honour</P></NOTE> that the mo&s;t infamous Puni&s;hment is reproachful only as long as it la&s;ts. He that &s;uffers it to day, will re-enter to+morrow, if the Prince thinks fit, into the mo&s;t important Offices.</P>
<P>Moreover, they boa&s;t of the Puni&s;hments which they receive by Order of their King, as of his paternal care for him whom he has the goodne&s;s to cha|&s;ti&s;e. He receives Compliments and Pre&s;ents after the Ba&s;tinado, and it is prin|cipally in the Ea&s;t that Cha&s;ti&s;ements do pa&s;s for te&s;timonies of Affection. We &s;aw a young <HI>Mandarin</HI> &s;hut up to be puni&s;hed, and a <HI>Frenchman</HI> offering him to go and ask his Pardon of his Superior: <HI>No,</HI> replied the <HI>Mandarin</HI> in <HI>Portugue&s;e, I would &s;ee how far his Love would reach;</HI> or as an <HI>European</HI> would have &s;aid, <HI>I would &s;ee how far he will extend his Rigor.</HI> To be reduced from an eminent place to a lower is no Reproach, and this befel the &s;econd Amba&s;&s;ador whom we &s;aw here. Yet it happens al&s;o, that in this Country they hang them&s;elves in de&s;pair, when they &s;ee them&s;elves reduced from an high Employment to an extreme Poverty, and to the &s;ix Months Service due to the Prince, tho' this Fall be not &s;hameful.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid in another place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Others are in|cluded in the Puni&s;hments with the Cri|minals.</NOTE> that a Father &s;hares &s;ometimes in the puni&s;hment of the Son, as being bound to an&s;wer for the Education which he has given him. At <HI>China</HI> an Officer an&s;wers for the Faults of all the per&s;ons of his Family, be|cau&s;e they pretend, that he who knows not how to govern his own Family, is not capable of any public Function. The Fear therefore, which particular per|&s;ons have of &s;eeing their Families turned out of the Employments, which do make the Splendor and Support thereof, renders them all wi&s;e, as if they were all Magi&s;trates.

<PB N="106" REF="64">
the Offences of another Officer that is &s;ubject to his Orders, by rea&s;on that he is to watch over him that depends on him; and that having power to correct him, he ought to an&s;wer for his conduct. Thus about three years &s;ince we &s;aw at <HI>Siam</HI> for three days, <HI>Oc-Pra-Simo-ho-&s;ot,</HI> by Nation a <HI>Brame,</HI> who is now in the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Council of State, expo&s;ed to the <HI>Cangue</HI> with the head of a Malefactor, which they had put to Death, hung about his Neck; without be|ing accu&s;ed of having had any other hand in the crime of him, who&s;e head was hung to his Neck, than too great Negligence in watching over a Man that was &s;ubject to him. After this 'tis no wonder in my opinion, that the Ba&s;tinado &s;hould be &s;o frequent at <HI>Siam.</HI> Sometimes there may be &s;een &s;everal Officers at the <HI>Cangue,</HI> di&s;po&s;ed in a Circle; and in the mid&s;t of them will be the head of a man, which they have put to death; and this head will hang by &s;everal &s;trings from the Neck of every one of the&s;e Officers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The lea&s;t pre|tence for a Crime is puni&s;hed.</NOTE>The wor&s;t is, that the lea&s;t appearance of guilt renders an action criminal: To be accu&s;ed is almo&s;t &s;ufficient to be culpable. An action in it &s;elf innocent becomes bad, &s;o &s;oon as any one thinks to make a Crime thereof. And from thence proceed the &s;o frequent di&s;graces of the principal Officers.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Policy of the Kings of <HI>Siam,</HI> cruel a|gain&s;t all, and again&s;t their own Bre|thren.</NOTE>The Greatne&s;s of the Kings, who&s;e Authority is de&s;potical, is to exerci&s;e Power over all, and over their own Brethren. The Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> do maim them, in &s;everal ways, when they can: they take away or debilitate their &s;ight by fire; they render them impotent by di&s;location of Members, or &s;otti&s;h by Drinks, &s;ecuring them&s;elves and their Children again&s;t the Enterprizes of their Brethren, only by rendring them incapable of reigning: he that now reigns has not treated his better. This Prince will not therefore envy our King, the &s;weetne&s;s of being beloved by his Subjects, and the Glory of being dreaded by his Enemies. The Idea of a great King is not at <HI>Siam,</HI> that he &s;hould render him&s;elf terrible to his Neighbours, provided he be &s;o to his Subjects.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Govern|ment of <HI>Siam</HI> more burden|&s;ome to the Nobles than to the Popu|lace.</NOTE>Yet there is this Reflection to be made on this &s;ort of Government, that the Yoke thereof is le&s;s heavy, if I may &s;o &s;ay, on the Populace than on the Nobles. Ambition in this Country leads to Slavery: Liberty, and the other Enjoy|ments of Life are for the vulgar Conditions. The more one is unknown to the Prince, and the further from him, the greater Ea&s;e he enjoys; and for this rea&s;on the Employments of the Provinces are there con&s;idered, as a Recompence of the Services done in the Palace.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How tempe|&s;tuous the Mi|ni&s;try is at <HI>Si|am.</HI></NOTE>The Mini&s;try there is tempe&s;tuous: not only thro the natural Incon&s;tancy, which may appear in the Prince's Mind; but becau&s;e that the ways are open for all per&s;ons to carry complaints to the Prince again&s;t his Mini&s;ters. And though the Mini&s;ters and all the other Officers, do employ all their artifices to render the&s;e ways of complaints ineffectual, whereby one may attack them all, yet all complaints are dangerous, and &s;ometimes it is the &s;lighte&s;t which hurts, and which &s;ubverts the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed favour. The&s;e examples, which very fre|quently happen, do edifie the People; and if the pre&s;ent King had not too far extended his exactions without any real nece&s;&s;ity, his Government would as much plea&s;e the Populace, as it is terrible to the Nobles.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s regards for his peo|ple.</NOTE>Neverthele&s;s he has had that regard for his People, as not to augment his Duties on cultivated Lands, and to lay no impo&s;ition on Corn and Fi&s;h; to the end that what is nece&s;&s;ary to Life might not be dear: A moderation &s;o much the more admirable, as it &s;eems that they ought not to expect any from a Prince educated in this Maxim, that his Glory con&s;i&s;ts in not &s;etting limits to his power, and always in augmenting his Trea&s;ure.</P>

The People which po&s;&s;e&s;s nothing in property, and which do reckon only upon what they have buried in the ground, as they have no &s;olid e&s;tabli&s;hment in their Country, &s;o they have no obligation thereto.

<PB N="107" REF="64">
having the a&s;&s;urance of not being able to bear a heavier, they concern not them|&s;elves in the Fortune of their Prince: and experience evinces that upon the lea&s;t trouble they let the Crown go, to whom Force or Policy will give it. A <HI>Sia|me&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> an <HI>Indian,</HI> will ea&s;ily die to exert a particular Hatred, or to avoid a mi&s;erable Life, or a too cruel Death: but to die for their Prince and their Country, is not a Vertue in their practice. Among&s;t them are not found the pow|erful motives, by which our People animate them&s;elves to a vigorous Defence.

Thus is it not lawful for a King to be a Minor, or too ea&s;ie to let him&s;elf be governed. The Scepter of this Country &s;oon falls from hands that need a &s;upport to &s;u&s;tain it. On the contrary, in Kingdoms where &s;everal permanent bodies of Magi&s;tracy divide the Splendor and the Exerci&s;e of the Royal Authority, the&s;e &s;ame bodies do pre&s;erve it entire for the King, who imparts it to them; becau&s;e they deliver not to the U&s;urper that part which is in their hands, and which alone &s;uffices to &s;ave that which the King him&s;elf knows not how to keep.</P>
<P>In the ancient Rebellions of <HI>China</HI> it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The peril in re-uniting all the Royal Au|thority in the Seal.</NOTE> that he who &s;eized on the Royal Seal, pre&s;ently rendered him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all; becau&s;e that the people obeyed the Orders where the Seal appear'd, without informing them&s;elves in who&s;e hands the Seal was.

<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Government has therefore all the defects of the De&s;potick Go|vernment. It renders the Prince and his Subjects equally uncertain: It betrays the Royal Authority, and delivers it up entire, under pretence of putting the more entire Management thereof into the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on; and more|over it deprives it of its natural defence, by &s;eparating the whole Intere&s;t of the

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Concerning the Form of Emba&s;&s;ies at <HI>Siam.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ea&s;tern Amba&s;&s;adors repre&s;ent not their Ma&s;ters, and are le&s;s honored than in <HI>Europe.</HI></NOTE>AN Amba&s;&s;ador throughout the Ea&s;t is no other than a Kings Me&s;&s;enger: he repre&s;ents not his Ma&s;ter. They honour him little, in compari&s;on of the re&s;pects which are render'd to the Letters of Credence whereof he is Bearer. Mr. <HI>de Chaumont,</HI> tho an Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary, never had a <HI>Balon</HI> of the Body, not on the very day of his entrance; and it was in a <HI>Balon</HI> of the Body that the Kings Letter was put, which he had to deliver to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI> This <HI>Balon</HI> had four <HI>&V;mbrella</HI>'s, one at each corner of the Seat; and it was attended with four other <HI>Balons</HI> of the Body, adorn'd with their <HI>&V;mbrella</HI>'s, but empty; as the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when he goes abroad in his Coach, and that he would be &s;een and known, has always one which follows him empty, which is called <HI>de re&s;peto,</HI> a word and cu&s;tom come from <HI>Italy.</HI> The Kings Pre&s;ents were like|wi&s;e carry'd in <HI>Balons</HI> of the Body; and the &s;ame things were ob&s;erved at the en|trance of the King's Envoys. Thus the Orientals make no difference between an Amba&s;&s;ador and an Envoy: And they under&s;tand not Amba&s;&s;adors, nor or|dinary Envoys, nor Re&s;idents; becau&s;e they &s;end no per&s;on to re&s;ide at a foreign Court, but there to di&s;patch a bu&s;ine&s;s, and return.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Emba&s;&s;ies con|&s;i&s;ts in three per&s;ons.</NOTE>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do never &s;end more nor le&s;s than three Amba&s;&s;adors together. The fir&s;t is called <HI>Rayja Tout,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Royal Me&s;&s;enger, the &s;econd <HI>Oubba Tout,</HI> and the third <HI>Tri Tout</HI> (terms which I under&s;tand not) but the two la&s;t Amba&s;&s;adors are obliged in every thing to follow the Advice of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">They are looked upon as Me&s;&s;engers which carry a Letter.</NOTE>Every one therefore who is the carrier of a Letter from the King, is reputed an Amba&s;&s;ador throughout the Ea&s;t. Wherefore, after the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which Mr. <HI>de Chaumont</HI> left in the Country of <HI>Siam,</HI> was dead at <HI>Tena&s;|&s;erim,</HI> his Dome&s;ticks having elected one among&s;t them, to deliver the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>'s Letter to the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> he that was elected was received without any other Character, as the real Amba&s;&s;ador would have been, and with the &s;ame honors which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> had formerly granted to the Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He returns them no An|&s;wer, but a <HI>Recepi&s;&s;e.</HI></NOTE>But that wherein they treat an Amba&s;&s;ador like a meer Me&s;&s;enger, is, that the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> in the Audience of Leave, gives him a <HI>Recepi&s;&s;e</HI> of the Letter he has received from him; and if this Prince returns an An&s;wer, he gives it not to him, but he &s;ends his own Amba&s;&s;adors with him to carry it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How the King of <HI>Siam</HI> is ad|verti&s;ed of the Arrival of an Amba&s;&s;ador.</NOTE>A foreign Amba&s;&s;ador which arrives at <HI>Siam,</HI> is &s;topped at the Entrance of the Kingdom, until the King of <HI>Siam</HI> has received intelligence thereof; and if he is accompanied with <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, as we were, it belongs to the <HI>Si|ame&s;e</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors to go before, to carry unto the King their Ma&s;ter, the news of their Arrival, and of the Arrival of the foreign Amba&s;&s;ador, whom they brought with them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Amba&s;&s;a|dor has his Charges born at <HI>Siam.</HI> He mu&s;t Commu|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">cate his In|&s;tructions.</NOTE>Every foreign Amba&s;&s;ador is lodged and maintained by the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> and during the time of his Emba&s;&s;y he may exerci&s;e Merchandize; but he cannot treat of any affair till he has delivered his Letter of Credence, and communicated his Original In&s;tructions. They di&s;penced with this la&s;t Ar|ticle to Mr. <HI>de Chaumont,</HI> and the King's Envoys; but the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Siam</HI> di&s;penc'd not therewith in <HI>France:</HI> They communicated their In&s;tru|ctions.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="65">The Amba&s;&s;ador cannot enter into the Metropolis,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He enters not into his Me|tropolis till he goes to Au|dience, and de|parts thence in going from the Audience of Leave. The Solemn Audiences.</NOTE> till he goes directly to Audience, nor continue therein till after the Audience of Leave: in going from the Audience of Leave he departs out of the City, and negotiates nothing more. Wherefore on the Evening before the Audience of Leave, the King of <HI>Siam</HI> demands of him, <HI>Whether he has any thing to propo&s;e?</HI> And in the Audience of Leave, he asks him, <HI>If he is contented?</HI></P>
<P>The Maje&s;ty of the Prince re&s;ides principally in the Metropolis, 'tis there that the Solemn Audiences are given; out of this City every Audience is accounted private, and without Ceremony. The whole Guard, as well the Ordinary, as that of O&s;tentation, was put in Arms for the Audience at <HI>Siam:</HI> the Elephants and the Hor&s;es appear'd with their be&s;t Harne&s;s, and in great number, on the Entry of the King's Envoys, and there was almo&s;t nothing of all this for the Audiences at <HI>Louvo.</HI> At <HI>Siam</HI> the <HI>&V;mbrella,</HI> which was before the King's win|dow, had nine Rounds, and the two which were at the &s;ide had &s;even each. At <HI>Louvo</HI> the King had no <HI>&V;mbrella</HI> before him, but two on each &s;ide, which had each four Rounds apiece, and which mounted up much lower than tho&s;e of <HI>Siam.</HI> The King was not at <HI>Louvo</HI> at a &s;ingle window, as at <HI>Siam;</HI> he was in a wooden Tower joined to the Floor of the Hall, into which he enter'd behind, and immediately, by a Step higher than the Hall. So that tho' this Prince was as high at <HI>Louvo</HI> as at <HI>Siam,</HI> yet he was at <HI>Louvo</HI> in the Hall of Audience; whereas at <HI>Siam</HI> he was in another Room, which had a Pro&s;pect into the Hall. Moreover, the Gate of the Hall at <HI>Louvo</HI> was large, and in the middle of the Tower, that is to &s;ay oppo&s;ite to the King; whereas at <HI>Siam</HI> the door was low and &s;trait, and almo&s;t at the corner of the Hall: differences, which have all their rea&s;ons in this Country, where the lea&s;t things are mea&s;ured and performed with diligence. At the Audience at <HI>Siam</HI> there were 50 Mandarins pro&s;trate in the Hall, 25 on each &s;ide, in five Ranks, each con&s;i&s;ting of five. At the Audiences at <HI>Louvo</HI> there were no more than 32, 16 on each &s;ide, in four Ranks, of four in a Rank. The Audience of Reception, where the Letter of Credence is delivered, is al|ways given in the chief City, and with all the magnificence imaginable, in re&s;pect to the Letter of Credence: the other Audiences are given with|out the City, and with le&s;s Pomp, becau&s;e there appears no Letter from the King.</P>
<P>The Cu&s;tom in all Audiences is, that the King &s;peaks fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is ob|&s;erved in Au|diences.</NOTE> and not the Am|ba&s;&s;ador. What he &s;peaks in Audiences of Ceremony, is reduced to &s;ome Que&s;tions almo&s;t always the &s;ame; after which, he orders the Amba&s;&s;ador to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the <HI>Barcalon</HI> upon all the Propo&s;itions which he has to make. Harrangues plea&s;e him not at all; tho' he had the goodne&s;s to acquaint me, upon the Compliments I had the Honour to make to him, that I was a great Contri|ver of Words. We were fain to embelli&s;h them with Figures, and therein to u&s;e the Sun, Moon and Stars; Ornaments of Di&s;cour&s;e, which may plea&s;e them in other things: This Prince thinks that the longer an Amba&s;&s;ador &s;peaks the fir&s;t time, the le&s;s he honours him. And indeed when the Amba&s;&s;ador is only a Me&s;&s;enger, which delivers a Letter, it is natural that he has nothing to &s;ay which is not asked him. After the King has &s;poken to the Amba&s;&s;ador, he gives him <HI>Arek</HI> and <HI>Betel,</HI> and a Ve&s;t, with which the Amba&s;&s;ador cloaths him&s;elf im|mediately, and &s;ometimes a Sabre, and a Chain of Gold.</P>
<P>This Prince gave Sabres, Chains of Gold and Ve&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">To Foreign|ers which are not Amba&s;&s;a|dors, he gives Audience only by accident. The <HI>Indians</HI> are cunning and deceitful in their Ne|gotiations.</NOTE> or &s;ometimes only Ve&s;ts to the principal <HI>French</HI> Officers, but gave them Audience only as it were by ac|cident in his Gardens, or out of his Palace at &s;ome Show.</P>
<P>In all &s;orts of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the <HI>Indians</HI> are &s;low in concluding, by rea&s;on of the length of their Councils, for they never depart from their Cu&s;toms. They are very phlegmatic and hypocritical. They are in&s;inuating in their Speeches, captious in their Writings, deceitful, to &s;uch a degree as to Cheat. The prai&s;e which the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Wives and Concubines give him, when they would flatter him to the highe&s;t degree, was to tell him, not that he was an Hero, or the greate&s;t General in the World, but that he had always been more politic and witty, than all the Princes with whom he had to do. They engage them|&s;elves in writing as little as they can. They will rather receive you into a Port,
<PB N="110" REF="66">
or into a Ca&s;tle, than they will agree with you to &s;urrender them up to you by a Treaty in ample Form, and &s;ealed by their <HI>Barcalon.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That the <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> have ever found it nece&s;&s;ary to treat the <HI>In|dians</HI> with arrogance.</NOTE>The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> being naturally bold and di&s;tru&s;tful, have always treated the <HI>Indians</HI> with a great deal of Loftine&s;s, and with very little Confidence: And the <HI>Dutch</HI> have thought they could not do better, than herein to imitate the <HI>Portugue&s;es;</HI> becau&s;e that indeed the <HI>Indians</HI> being educated in a Spirit of Ser|vitude, are crafty, and, as I have &s;aid in another place, &s;ub&s;ervient to tho&s;e who treat them haughtily, and in&s;olent to tho&s;e that u&s;e them gently. The King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ays of his Subjects, that they are of the temper of Apes, who tremble &s;o long as one holds the end of their Band, and who di&s;own their Ma&s;ter, when the Band is loo&s;ed. Examples are not rare in <HI>India</HI> of &s;imple <HI>European</HI> Factors, who have ba&s;tinado'd the Officers of the <HI>Indian</HI> Kings without being puni&s;hed. And it is evident, that the certain vigorous Repartees which are &s;ometimes made in our Countries, appear to us more daring, than the Ba&s;tinado is in theirs; pro|vided it be given them in cold Blood, and not in Anger: A Man that &s;uffers him&s;elf to be tran&s;ported with Pa&s;&s;ion, is what the <HI>Indians</HI> mo&s;t contemn.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;ents are e&s;&s;ential to Emba&s;&s;ies in the Ea&s;t.</NOTE>But as Trade is their mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Intere&s;t, Pre&s;ents are e&s;&s;ential for them in Emba&s;&s;ies. 'Tis a trafficking under an honourable Title, and from King to King. Their Politene&s;s excites them to te&s;tify by &s;everal Demon&s;trations, how they e&s;teem the Pre&s;ents which they have received. If it is any thing of u&s;e, tho' it be not for their u&s;e, they publickly prepare whatever &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e it, as if they had a real de&s;ire thereof. If it is any thing to wear, they will adorn them&s;elves therewith in your pre&s;ence. If they are Hor&s;es, they will build a Stable on purpo&s;e to lodge them. Was it only a Tele&s;cope, they would build a Tower to &s;ee with this Gla&s;s. And &s;o they will &s;eem to make an high ac|count of all &s;orts of Pre&s;ents, to honour the Prince which &s;ends them, unle&s;s he has received Pre&s;ents from their part with le&s;s demon&s;trations of E&s;teem. Neverthele&s;s they are really concern'd only for the Profit. Before that the King's Pre&s;ents went out of our hands, &s;ome of the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Officers came to take an exact de&s;cription thereof in writing, even to the counting all the Stones of every &s;ort which were inter&s;pers'd in the Embroideries; and to the end that it might not &s;eem that the King their Ma&s;ter took this care to prevent being robbed by his Officers, through who&s;e hands the Pre&s;ents were to pa&s;s, they pretended that this Prince was curious and impatient, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary to go render him an account of what this was, and to be ready to an|&s;wer him exactly upon the lea&s;t things.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Orientals do e&s;teem it a great Honour to receive Em|ba&s;&s;ies.</NOTE>All the Oriental Princes do e&s;teem it a great Honour to receive Emba&s;&s;ies, and to &s;end the fewe&s;t they can: Becau&s;e that, in their Opinion, it is a Badge which cannot be alien'd from them and their Riches, and that they can content them&s;elves without the Riches of Foreigners. They look upon Emba&s;&s;ies as a kind of Homage; and in their Courts they retain the Foreign Mini&s;ters as long as it is po&s;&s;ible, to prolong, as much as in them lies, the Honour which they receive. Thus the great <HI>Mogul,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> do never &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors. The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ends only to <HI>Siam,</HI> becau&s;e that the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Amba&s;&s;ador had demanded it, as I proceed to relate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors are accoun|table.</NOTE>The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors are accountable, becau&s;e that they are loaded with Goods; and it rarely happens, that they render an Account good enough en|tirely to avoid the Ba&s;tinado. Thus <HI>Agi Selim</HI> ('tis the name of a <HI>Moor,</HI> whom the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ent eight or nine years &s;ince into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as his Amba&s;&s;ador) was &s;everely cha&s;ti&s;ed at his return, tho' in appearance he had &s;erved very faith|fully. He had e&s;tabli&s;hed Commerce with <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and had brought with him that <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, who, as I have &s;everal times related, dyed at <HI>Tena&s;&s;erim.</HI> He was a <HI>Moula,</HI> or Doctor of the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whom <HI>Agi Selim</HI> had de|manded of the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> to in&s;truct, as he pretended, the King of <HI>Siam</HI> in Mahumetani&s;m. <HI>Bernier</HI> Tome II. pag. 54. reports that during his abode in the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;ome Amba&s;&s;adors from <HI>Pre&s;ter John,</HI> who, as every one knows, pro|fe&s;&s;es to be a Chri&s;tian, demanded of the great <HI>Mogul</HI> an <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and eight of the mo&s;t renowned Books that were in the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion; a ba&s;e Flat|tery, which exceedingly &s;candalized <HI>Bernier.</HI> But generally &s;peaking, the&s;e tra|ding Kings do exceedingly make u&s;e of the pretence of Religion, for the increa&s;e of their Commerce.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Policy ob&s;erved in re&s;pect of the Strangers fled to <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>'TWas, as I have &s;aid, the Liberty of Commerce, which had formerly invi|ted to <HI>Siam</HI> a great multitude of Strangers of different Nations; who &s;et|tled there with the Liberty of living according to their Cu&s;toms, and of pub|lickly exerci&s;ing their &s;everal ways of Wor&s;hip. Every Nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a diffe|rent Quarter. The Quarters which are without the City, and which do com|po&s;e the Suburbs thereof, the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Camp,</HI> and the <HI>Siame&s;es Ban.</HI> Moreover every Nation choo&s;es its Chief, or its <HI>Nai,</HI> as the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do &s;peak, and this Chief manages the Affairs of his Nation with the <HI>Mandarin,</HI> whom the King of <HI>Siam</HI> nominates for this purpo&s;e, and whom they call the <HI>Mandarin</HI> of this Nation. But Affairs of the lea&s;t importance are not determined by this <HI>Man|darin,</HI> they are carried to the <HI>Barcalon.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fortune of the <HI>Moors</HI> very different at <HI>Siam,</HI> at &s;e|veral times.</NOTE>Among&s;t the &s;everal Nations, that of the <HI>Moors</HI> has been the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed under this Reign. It once hapned that the <HI>Barcalon</HI> was a <HI>Moor,</HI> probably be|cau&s;e the King of <HI>Siam</HI> thought by this means better to e&s;tabli&s;h his Commerce, among&s;t the mo&s;t powerful of his Neighbouring Princes, who do all make pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Mahumetani&s;m: The principal Offices of the Court, and of the Pro|vinces were then in the hands of the <HI>Moors:</HI> The King of <HI>Siam</HI> cau&s;ed &s;everal Mo&s;ques to be erected for them at his expence, and he &s;till bears the charges of their principal Fe&s;tival, which they celebrate for &s;everal days together, in me|mory of the Death of <HI>Haly,</HI> or of his Children. The <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> which embraced the Religion of the <HI>Moors,</HI> had the Priviledge of being exempted from the per|&s;onal Service: But the <HI>Barcalon Moor</HI> &s;oon experienced the Incon&s;tancy of the Fortunes of <HI>Siam,</HI> he fell into Di&s;grace, and the Credit of tho&s;e of his Nation fell afterwards into Decay. The con&s;iderable Offices and Employments were taken away from them, and the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> which were turned Mahumetans, were forc'd to pay in ready Money for the &s;ix Months Service, from which they had been exempted. Neverthele&s;s their Mo&s;ques are remaining to them, as well as the publick Protection which the King of <HI>Siam</HI> gives to their Religion, as to all foreign Religions. There are therefore three or four Thou&s;and <HI>Moors</HI> at <HI>Siam,</HI> as many <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> born in <HI>India,</HI> and as many <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and perhaps as many <HI>Malays,</HI> be&s;ides what there is of other Nations.</P>

The King his Father had heretofore done the &s;ame thing, and perhaps it is the Policy of <HI>Siam</HI> to do it thus from time to time; otherwi&s;e it is certain that they have almo&s;t always left the Trade free, and that it has fre|quently flouri&s;hed at <HI>Siam.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Fo|reign Trade cea&s;ed at <HI>Siam.</HI></NOTE>Commerce requires a certain liberty: no per&s;on can re&s;olve to go to <HI>Siam,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily to &s;ell unto the King what is carry'd thither, and to buy of him alone what one would carry thence, when this was not the product of the Kingdom. For though there were &s;everal foreign Ships together at <HI>Siam,</HI> the Trade was not permitted from one Ship to the other, nor with the Inhabitants of the Country, Natives or Foreigners, till that the King, under the pretence of a preference due to his Royal dignity, had purcha&s;ed what was be&s;t in the Ships, and at his own rate, to &s;ell it afterwards as he plea&s;ed: becau&s;e that when the &s;ea&s;on for the departure of the Ships pre&s;&s;es on, the Merchants choo&s;e rather to &s;ell to great lo&s;s, and dearly to buy a new Cargo, than to wait at <HI>Siam</HI> a new &s;ea&s;on to depart, without hopes of making a better Trade.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVII.</HI> Of the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> and their Convents.</HEAD>
<P>THey live in Convents, which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Vat;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The origine of the word <HI>Pa|god.</HI></NOTE> and they make u&s;e of the Temples, which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Pihan,</HI> and the <HI>Portugue&s;es Pagode,</HI> from the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word <HI>Poutgheda,</HI> which &s;ignifies a Temple of Idols; but the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> do u&s;e the word <HI>Pagode,</HI> to &s;ignify equally the Idol and the Temple.</P>
<P>The Temple and the Convent do take up a very great &s;quare piece of ground,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A De&s;cription of the Con|vents of the <HI>Talapoins.</HI></NOTE>
encompa&s;t with an Inclo&s;ure of Bambou. In the middle of the ground &s;tands the Temple, as in the place e&s;teemed the mo&s;t honourable in their Encampments; and at the corners of this ground, and along the Bambou Inclo&s;ure, are ranged the Cells of the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> like the Tents of an Army; and &s;ometimes the Rows thereof are double, or triple: The&s;e Cells are little &s;ingle Hou&s;es, erected on Piles, and that of the Superior is after the &s;ame manner, but a little larger and higher than the re&s;t. The Pyramids &s;tand near and quite round the Temple: and the ground which the Temple and the Pyramids take up, be&s;ides its being higher, is inclo&s;ed between four Walls: but from the&s;e Walls to the Cells there likewi&s;e remains a great void piece of Ground, which is as it were the Court of the Convent. Sometimes the&s;e Walls are all bare, and &s;erve only as an Inclo&s;ure to the ground, which the Temple and the Pyramids take up: Sometimes along the&s;e Walls there are covered Galleries of the Figure of tho&s;e, which in our Religious Hou&s;es we call the Cloy&s;ter; and on a counterwall brea&s;t high, which runs along the&s;e Galleries, they place in a Train, and clo&s;e together, a great number of Idols &s;ometimes gilded.</P>
<P>Though at <HI>Siam</HI> there are &s;ome <HI>Talapoine&s;&s;es,</HI> or Women,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have Cells for the <HI>Talapoine&s;&s;es.</HI></NOTE> who in mo&s;t things do ob&s;erve the Rule of the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> yet they have no other Convents than tho&s;e of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> them&s;elves: The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do think that the advanced Age of all the&s;e Women, for there are none young, is a &s;ufficient caution of their Cha&s;ti|ty. There are not <HI>Talapoine&s;&s;es</HI> in all the Convents: but in tho&s;e where any are, their Cells run along one of the &s;ides of the Bambou Inclo&s;ure, which I have mentioned, without being otherwi&s;e &s;eparated from tho&s;e of the <HI>Talapoins.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Neus,</HI> or <HI>Talapoin Children,</HI> are di&s;per&s;ed one, two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the <HI>Tala|poin</HI> Children are lodg'd.</NOTE> or three into every <HI>Talapoins</HI> Cell, and they &s;erve the <HI>Talapoin</HI> with whom they lodge, that is to &s;ay with whom they have been placed by their Parents: So that when a <HI>Talapoin</HI> has two or three <HI>Nens,</HI> he receives no more. In a word, the&s;e <HI>Nens</HI> are not all young; &s;ome there are which do grow old in this Condition, which is not thought entirely religious, and the elde&s;t of all they call <HI>Taten.</HI> It belongs to
<PB N="114" REF="69">
him to pluck up the Weeds which grow in the ground of the Convent, which the <HI>Talapoins</HI> them&s;elves cannot do, in their opinion, without &s;in.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Halls of the Convent.</NOTE>The School of the <HI>Nens</HI> is a Hall of Bambou &s;tanding alone; and be&s;ides this Hall, there is always &s;uch another, where the People carry their Alms on the days when the Temple is &s;hut, and where the <HI>Talapoins</HI> a&s;&s;emble for their ordinary Conferences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Steeple.</NOTE>The Steeple is a Wooden Tower &s;tanding al&s;o alone, they call it <HI>Horacang,</HI> or the Belfry; but the Bell has no Clapper. They &s;trike it with a Mallet or Wooden Hammer to &s;ound it: and it is only in War, or for things of War, that they &s;trike their Ba&s;ons, and other In&s;truments of Bra&s;s or Copper, with Iron Hammers.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Supe|riors.</NOTE>Every Convent is under the Conduct of a Superior called <HI>Tchaou-Vat,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Lord or Ma&s;ter of the Convent; but all the Superiors are not of equal dignity: The mo&s;t honorable are tho&s;e which they call <HI>Sancrat,</HI> and the <HI>Sancrat</HI> of the Convent of the Palace is the mo&s;t reverend of all. Yet no Superior, nor no <HI>Sancrat,</HI> has Authority or Juri&s;diction over another. This body would be too formidable if it had but one head, and if it acted always unanimou&s;ly, and according to the &s;ame Maxims.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the <HI>San|crats.</HI></NOTE>The Mi&s;&s;ionaries have compared the <HI>Sancrats</HI> to our Bi&s;hops, and the &s;imple Superiors to our Curates; and they have &s;ome inclination to believe that this Country has formerly had &s;ome Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hops, to whom the <HI>Sancrats</HI> have &s;ucceeded. None but the <HI>Sancrats</HI> indeed can make <HI>Talapoins,</HI> as none but Bi|&s;hops can make Prie&s;ts. But otherwi&s;e the <HI>Sancrats</HI> have not any Juri&s;diction nor any Authority, neither over the People, nor over the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> which are not of their Convent; and they could not inform me whether they have any particular Character which makes them <HI>Sancrats,</HI> &s;ave that they are Superiors of certain Convents de&s;igned for <HI>Sancrats.</HI> Every Convent therefore de&s;ign'd for a <HI>Sancrat</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other Convents, wherein there are only &s;imple Superiors, by &s;ome Stones planted round the Temple, and near its Walls, each of which is double, and bears &s;ome re&s;emblance, but at a very great di|&s;tance, with a Mitre &s;et upon a Pede&s;tal. I have in&s;erted the Figure thereof in the Print of a Temple. Their Name in <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> is <HI>Sema.</HI> Now 'tis this re|&s;emblance of the&s;e Stones with the Mitres, that is the principal Foundation of the Su&s;picion, which the Mi&s;&s;ionaries have, that the <HI>Sancrats</HI> have &s;ucceeded &s;ome Bi&s;hops. The more of the&s;e Stones there is round a Temple, the more the <HI>Sancrat</HI> is thought advanced in Dignity; but there never is fewer than two, nor more than eight. The Ignorance under which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are, as to what the&s;e Stones do &s;ignifie, has put the Mi&s;&s;ionaries upon &s;eeking the Origine there|of in Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The honors of the <HI>Sancrats.</HI></NOTE>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> gives to the principal <HI>Sancrats</HI> a Name, an Umbrella, a Se|dan, and &s;ome men to carry it; but the <HI>Sancrats</HI> do make u&s;e of this Equipage only to wait upon the King, and they never are <HI>Talapoins</HI> that carry the Sedan. The <HI>Sancrat</HI> of the Palace is now called <HI>Pra Viriat.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spirit of this In&s;titution.</NOTE>The Spirit of the In&s;titution of the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> is, to keep them&s;elves from the Sins of the People, to lead a penitent Life for the Sins of tho&s;e that be&s;tow Alms upon them, and to live on Alms. They eat not in common, and tho they be very ho&s;pitable to the Seculars, which have recour&s;e to them, and even to Chri&s;tians, yet it is prohibited them to &s;hare the Alms which they receive, or at lea&s;t to do it pre&s;ently; becau&s;e that every one of them being thought to repent &s;ufficiently, has no need to redeem his Sins by be&s;towing Alms on his Companion, and perhaps they would al&s;o oblige them all to the fatigue of begging: Neverthele&s;s a <HI>Talapoin</HI> is not prohibited from ever giving any thing to his Brother, or from a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in a real Nece&s;&s;ity. They have two Lodg|ings, one on each &s;ide of their door to receive the Pa&s;&s;engers, who de&s;ire a bed among&s;t them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">There are two &s;orts of <HI>Tala|poins.</HI></NOTE>There are two &s;orts of <HI>Talapoins</HI> at <HI>Siam,</HI> as in all the re&s;t of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Some do live in the Woods, and others in the Cities. And tho&s;e of the Woods do lead, as they &s;ay, a Life which would appear intolerable, and which would doubtle&s;s be &s;o in Countries le&s;s hot than <HI>Siam,</HI> or than the <HI>Thebais</HI> of <HI>Aegypt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="69">All, that is to &s;ay tho&s;e of the Cities, and tho&s;e of the Woods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are ob|liged to Celi|bacy under the penalty of the Fire.</NOTE> are obliged under pain of Fire &s;trictly to keep Celibacy, &s;o long as they continue in their Profe&s;&s;ion; and the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> from who&s;e Juri&s;diction they cannot with|draw them&s;elves, pardons them not in this point: for as they have great Privi|ledges, and among&s;t other things are exempted from the &s;ix Months Service, it imports him that the Profe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Talapoin</HI> become not altogether convenient, for fear le&s;t all his Subjects embrace it.</P>

Their Examiner was <HI>Oc-Louang Souracac,</HI> a young man of about Twenty eight or Thirty years old, the Son of that <HI>Oc-Pra Pipitcharat|cha,</HI> who, as I have &s;aid, commands the Elephants; but the <HI>Talapoins</HI> of the Woods had refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the Examination of a Secular, and con&s;ented to be examined only by one of their Superiors.</P>
<P>They educate the Youth, as I have related;<NOTE PLACE="marg">They Educate the Youth and in&s;truct the People.</NOTE> and they explain their Doctrine to the People, according as it is written in their <HI>Balie</HI> Books. They preach the next day after every new and every full Moon, and the People are ever very con|&s;tant in the Temples. When the Channel of the River is full of Rain-water, until the Inundation begins to &s;ink, they preach every day, from &s;ix in the Morning till Dinner-time, and from one in the Afternoon till five in the Even|ing. The Preacher is &s;eated cro&s;s-leg'd in a high Chair of State, and &s;everal <HI>Ta|lapoins</HI> relea&s;e one another in this Office.</P>
<P>The People approves the Doctrine which is preach'd to them in the&s;e <HI>Balie</HI> words, <HI>&s;a tou &s;a,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>it is &s;o Sir,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Trade is gainful.</NOTE> or in other <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> words which amount to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e; and then they give Alms to the Preacher: and tho&s;e that do preach frequently, not only at this time, but during the whole cour&s;e of the year, do ea&s;ily become rich.</P>
<P>Now it is this time which the <HI>Europeans</HI> have called the Lent of the <HI>Talapoins.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Lent of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> and of their facility in fa&s;t|ing.</NOTE>
Their Fa&s;ting is to eat nothing from Noon, unle&s;s they may chew <HI>Betel:</HI> but when they do not fa&s;t, they only eat Fruit in the Afternoon. The <HI>Indians</HI> are naturally &s;o &s;ober, that a Fa&s;t of Forty, nay of an Hundred days, appears not in|credible to them. <HI>Twi&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Dutch</HI> Author, in his <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of the <HI>Indies</HI> reports, that <HI>Experience has certainly evinced that there are &s;ome</HI> Indians <HI>that can fa&s;t Twenty, Thirty,</HI> and <HI>Forty</HI> days, without taking any thing but a little Liquor mixed with &s;ome bitter Wood reduced to Powder. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have cited the example of a <HI>Talapoin,</HI> whom they pretend to have fa&s;ted an hundred and &s;even days, without eating any thing But when I &s;ounded their opinion thereon, I found that they attributed this Fa&s;t to Magick; and to prove it to me, they added, that it was ea&s;ie to live on the Gra&s;s of the Fields; provided they breathed thereon, and utter'd certain words, which they under&s;tood not, or which they would not in|form me, or which they &s;aid that others under&s;tood.</P>
<P>After the Rice-Harve&s;t the <HI>Talapoins</HI> do go for three Weeks to watch in the Nights in the middle of the Fields,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Watch of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> in the Fields; and the E|&s;teem which the People makes thereof.</NOTE> under &s;mall Huts of branches of Leaves ranged &s;quare; and in the day they return to vi&s;it the Temple, and to &s;leep in their Cells. The Hut of the Superior &s;tands in the middle of the others, and higher. They make no Fire in the Night to &s;care away the wild Bea&s;ts, as all tho&s;e that travel in the Woods of this Country us'd to do, and as was done round the <HI>Tabanques</HI> wherein we lodged: So that the People look upon it as a Miracle, that the <HI>Talapoins</HI> are not devoured; and I know not what precaution they u&s;e, except that of enclo&s;ing them&s;elves in a Park of <HI>Bambou.</HI> But doubt|le&s;s they cho&s;e places little expo&s;ed, remote from the Woods, and where the &s;a|vage Bea&s;ts cannot come with Hunger, but after having found a great deal of Food, for it is the &s;ea&s;on wherein there is plenty of Forage on the ground. The People admire al&s;o the &s;ecurity, in which the <HI>Talapoins</HI> of the Woods do live: For they have neither Convent nor Temple to retire into. They think that the Tygers, Elephants, and Rhinoceros do re&s;pect them, and lick their hands and feet, when they find any one a&s;leep: but the&s;e may make a Fire of <HI>Bambou,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="70">
to defend them&s;elves from the&s;e Animals, they may lie in the clo&s;e&s;t Thickets; and moreover, though the people &s;hould find the remains of &s;ome man devoured, it would never be pre&s;umed he was a <HI>Talapoin;</HI> and when they could not doubt thereof, they would pre&s;ume that this <HI>Talapoin</HI> had been wicked, and would not cea&s;e to believe that the Bea&s;ts re&s;pect the good. And it mu&s;t needs be that the Woods are not &s;o dangerous as they report, &s;eeing that &s;o many Families do &s;eek Sanctuary there again&s;t the Government.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Talapoins</HI> have a Chap|let.</NOTE>I know not what the <HI>Talapoins</HI> do pretend, either by this Watch, or by their Lent; I ignore al&s;o what the Chaplets of one Hundred and eight Grains, on which they recite certain <HI>Balie</HI> words, do mean.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Habit.</NOTE>They go with naked feet and bare-headed, like the re&s;t of the People: round their Reins and Thighs they wear the <HI>Pagne</HI> of the Seculars, but of yellow Lin|nen, which is the colour of their Kings, and of the Kings of <HI>China:</HI> and they have no Mu&s;lin Shirt, nor any Ve&s;t. Their Habit con&s;i&s;ts of four pieces. The fir&s;t which they call <HI>Ang&s;a,</HI> is a kind of Shoulder Belt of yellow Linnen, five or &s;ix Inches broad; they wear it on their left Shoulder, and button it with a &s;ingle button on the right Hip; and it de&s;cends not lower than the Hip. Over this Belt they put another great yellow cloath, which is called the <HI>Pagne</HI> of the <HI>Talapoin,</HI> and which they call <HI>Pa Schivon,</HI> or the Cloth of &s;everal pieces, becau&s;e it ought to be patched in &s;everal places. 'Tis a kind of Scapulary, which rea|ches down to the ground behind and before; and which covering only the left Shoulder returns to the right Hip, and leaves the two Arms and all the right Shoulder free. Over the <HI>Pa Schivon</HI> is the <HI>Pa Pat.</HI> 'Tis another cloth four or five Inches broad which they do likewi&s;e put over the left Shoulder, but like a Hood; it de&s;cends to the Navel before, and as much behind as before. Its co|lour is &s;ometimes red: the <HI>Sancrats</HI> and the mo&s;t ancient <HI>Talapoins</HI> do wear it thus, but the <HI>Ang&s;a</HI> and the <HI>Pa Schivon</HI> can never be other than yellow. To keep the <HI>Pa Pat</HI> and the <HI>Pa Schivon</HI> in a po&s;ture, they girt the middle of their bo|dy with a Scarf of yellow Cloth which they call <HI>Rappacod,</HI> and which is the fourth and la&s;t piece of their Habit.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>They have a little Iron-Ba|&s;on for beg|ging.</P>
<P>They &s;have all the Head, and have a Screen in their hand.</P></NOTE>When they go a begging they carry an Iron Ba&s;on, to receive what is given them; and they carry it in a Linnen Bag, which hangs on the left &s;ide, by two ends of a Rope hung like a Belt over the right Shoulder.</P>
<P>They &s;have all their Beard, Head, and Eyebrows; and to defend them&s;elves from the Sun they have the <HI>Talapat,</HI> which is their little <HI>&V;mbrella,</HI> in form of a Screen, as I have already &s;aid in the other part. The Superior is forced to &s;have him&s;elf, becau&s;e no per&s;on can touch his head, without &s;howing him di&s;re&s;pect. By the &s;ame rea&s;on a young <HI>Talapoin</HI> dares not to &s;have an old one: but it is law|ful for the old to &s;have the young, I mean tho&s;e Children who&s;e Education is committed to them, and who know not how to &s;have them&s;elves. Neverthe|le&s;s when the Superior is very old, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he permit another to &s;have him; and this other does it after having de&s;ired an expre&s;s Permi&s;&s;ion. In a word, the Razors of <HI>Siam</HI> are of Copper.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The days on which they &s;have them|&s;elves, are days of Devotion to the People.</NOTE>The days on which they &s;have them&s;elves, are tho&s;e of the new and full Moon; and on the&s;e days the <HI>Talapoins</HI> and the People do fa&s;t, that is to &s;ay, they eat nothing from Noon. The People ab&s;tain al&s;o on the&s;e days from going a Fi&s;hing, not that Fi&s;hing is a work, for they ab&s;tain not from any other Labor, but becau&s;e that, in my opinion, they e&s;teem not Fi&s;hing wholly innocent, as we &s;hall &s;ee in the &s;equel. And in fine, the People on the&s;e days do carry unto the Convents &s;ome Alms, which con&s;i&s;t in Money, Fruits, Pagnes, or Cattle. If the Cattle are dead, the <HI>Talapoins</HI> do eat them: if they are alive, they let them live and die about the Temple; and they eat them only when they die of them&s;elves.

<P>The People voluntarily a&s;&s;i&s;t at the&s;e Fe&s;tivals, and make a &s;how with their new Cloaths. One of their greate&s;t Charities is to give Liberty to &s;ome Ani|mals, which they buy of tho&s;e that have taken them in the Fields. What they

give to the Idol, they offer not immediately to the Idol, but to the <HI>Talapoins;</HI> and they pre&s;ent it to the Idol, either by holding it in their hand before the Idol, or by laying it upon the Altar; and in a little time after they take it away, and convert it to their own u&s;es. Sometimes the People offer up lighted Tapers, which the <HI>Talapoins</HI> do fa&s;ten to the knees of the Statue, and this is the rea&s;on why one of the knees of a great many Idols is ungilt.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Concerning the Doctrine of the <HI>Talapoins.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL the <HI>Indies</HI> are full of <HI>Talapoins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Divers kinds of <HI>Talapoins</HI> in the <HI>Indies.</HI></NOTE> tho' they have not everywhere this Name, and live not everywhere after the &s;ame manner. Some marry, and others &s;trictly ob&s;erve Celibacy. Some eat Meat, provided it is given them &s;lain, others never eat any. Some do kill Animals, others kill none at all; and others do kill very rarely, and for &s;ome Sacrifice. Their Doctrine appears not more exactly the &s;ame in all places, tho' the Foundation thereof be always the opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is;</HI> and their Wor&s;hip is al&s;o various, tho' it always refers to the dead.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that they believe all Nature animated, not only Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they believe the whole anima|ted Nature, and what <HI>Idea</HI> they have of the Anima|tion</NOTE> Bea&s;ts and Plants, but the Heaven, the Planets, the Earth, and the other Elements, the Rivers, the Mountains, the Cities, the Hou&s;es them&s;elves. And moreover, as all Souls appear to them of the &s;ame Nature, and indifferent to enter into all Bodies, of what kind &s;oever they be, it &s;eems that they have not the <HI>Idea</HI> of the Animation as we have. They believe that the Soul is in the Body, and that it rules the Body, but it appears not that they believe like us, that the Soul is phy&s;ically united to the Body, to make one with it. So far are they from think|ing that the natural Inclinations of Souls is to be in Bodies, that they believe it is a Penance for them, to extirpate their Sins by their Sufferings, becau&s;e that indeed there is no kind of Life which has not its Troubles. The &s;upreme Feli|city of the Soul, in their opinion, is not to be obliged to animate any Body, but to remain eternally in repo&s;e. And the true Hell of the Soul is on the contra|ry, according to them, the perpetual nece&s;&s;ity of animating Bodies, and of pa&s;|&s;ing from one to another by continual Tran&s;migrations. 'Tis &s;aid, that among&s;t the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> there are &s;ome which boldly a&s;&s;ert, that they remember their pa&s;t Tran&s;migrations; and the&s;e Te&s;timonies do doubtle&s;s &s;uffice to confirm the People in the Opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is.</HI> The <HI>Europeans</HI> have &s;ometimes tran&s;lated by the word <HI>Tutelar Genius,</HI> the Souls which the <HI>Indians</HI> give to the Bodies, which we e&s;teem inanimate: But the&s;e <HI>Genii</HI> are certainly in the Opi|nion of the <HI>Indians</HI> only real Souls, which they &s;uppo&s;e equally to animate all the Bodies wherein they are pre&s;ent, but after a manner which corre&s;ponds not to the <HI>Phy&s;ical &V;nion</HI> of our Schools.</P>
<P>The Figure of the World, according to their Doctrine, is eternal;<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they think of the Eternity of the World.</NOTE> but the World which we &s;ee is not, for whatever we &s;ee therein, lives in their Opinion, and mu&s;t die; and at the &s;ame time there will &s;pring up other Beings of the &s;ame kind, another Heaven, another Earth, and other Stars; and this is the ground of what they &s;ay, that they have &s;een Nature decay and revive again &s;everal times.</P>
<P>No Opinion has been &s;o generally receiv'd among&s;t Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the nature of the Soul ac|cording to them.</NOTE> as that of the Im|mortality of the Soul; but that the Soul is immaterial, is a Truth the knowledg of which is not &s;o much propagated; Thus is it a very great difficulty to give
<PB N="120" REF="72">
unto a <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> the <HI>Idea</HI> of a pure Spirit; and this is the Te&s;timony which the Mi&s;&s;ionaries give thereof, that have been longe&s;t among&s;t them. All the <HI>Pagans</HI> of the Ea&s;t do believe indeed that there remains &s;omething of Man after his death, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts &s;eparately and independantly from its body; but they give extent and figure to what ramains, and in a word they attribute unto it all the &s;ame Members, and all the &s;ame &s;olid and liquid Sub&s;tances whereof our Bodies are compo&s;ed. They &s;uppo&s;e only that the Souls are of a matter &s;ubtile enough, to be free from touch and &s;ight; tho' they believe that if any one be wounded, the blood which flows from its wound, may appear. Such were the <HI>Manes</HI> and <HI>Shades</HI> of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> and it is by this figure of the Souls like unto that of the Bodies, that <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;uppo&s;es that <HI>Aeneas</HI> knew <HI>Palinurus, Dido,</HI> and <HI>Anchi&s;es</HI> in Hell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ab&s;urdi|ty of their Opinion.</NOTE>Now what is altogether impertinent in this Opinion, is, that the Orientals cannot tell why they attribute the humane Figure, rather than any other, to the Soul, which they &s;uppo&s;e able to animate all &s;orts of Bodies, be&s;ides the humane Body. When the <HI>Tartar</HI> which now reigns at <HI>China,</HI> would force the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> to &s;have their hair after the <HI>Tartarian</HI> fa&s;hion, &s;everal of them cho&s;e rather to &s;uffer death, than to go, they &s;aid, into the other World, to appear before their Ance&s;tors without hair; imagining, that they &s;haved the head of the Soul, by &s;having that of the Body.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pu|ni&s;hments and Recompences of the Soul after death.</NOTE>The Souls therefore, tho' material, are yet imperi&s;hable in their Opinion; and at their departure out of this life, they are puni&s;hed or recompenced, with Pu|ni&s;hments or Plea&s;ures proportioned in greatne&s;s and duration to their good or evil works, until they re-enter into the humane Body, wherein they mu&s;t enjoy a Life more or le&s;s happy, according to the Good or Evil they have committed in a former Life.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they ex|plain the Pro|&s;perity of the Wicked, and the Misfor|tunes of the Good.</NOTE>If a Man is unfortunate before he has done ami&s;s, as if he is dead-born, the <HI>Indians</HI> believe that he has merited it in a former Life, and that then perhaps he cau&s;ed &s;ome Great-belly'd Woman to mi&s;carry. If, on the contrary, they ob|&s;erve a wicked Man to pro&s;per, they believe that he enjoys the Recompence which he has merited in another Life by good Actions. If the Life of the Man is mixt with Pro&s;perity and Adver&s;ity, 'tis becau&s;e every Man, they &s;ay, has done Good and Evil when he formerly lived. In a word, no Per&s;on &s;uffers any Mi&s;|fortune, according to their Opinion, if he has always been innocent; nor is he always happy, if he has at any time been culpable; nor does he enjoy any Pro|&s;perity, which he has not merited by &s;ome good Action.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the &s;everal places where the Soul pa&s;&s;es after death.</NOTE>Be&s;ides the divers manners of being of this World, as of Plant, or of Ani|mal, to which the Souls are &s;ucce&s;&s;ively linked after death, they reckon &s;everal places out of this World, where the Souls are puni&s;hed or rewarded. Some are more happy, and others more mi&s;erable than the World wherein we are. They make all the&s;e places as Stages in the whole extent of Nature, and their Books do vary in the number; tho' the mo&s;t common Opinion is, that there are nine happy, and as many unhappy. The nine happy places are over our heads, the nine unhappy are under our feet; and the higher a place is, the happier it is; as al&s;o the lower it is, the more unhappy it is: &s;o that the happy extend far above the Stars, as the unhappy do &s;ink a great way beneath the earth. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call the Inhabitants of the &s;uperior Worlds <HI>Theuada,</HI> tho&s;e of the inferior Worlds <HI>Pii,</HI> and tho&s;e of this World <HI>Manout.</HI> The <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have tran&s;lated the word <HI>Theuada</HI> by that of <HI>Angels,</HI> and the word <HI>Pii</HI> by that of <HI>Devils;</HI> and they have given the Name of <HI>Paradice</HI> to the &s;uperior Worlds, and that of <HI>Hell</HI> to the inferior.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">It there re|vives again.</NOTE>But the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do not believe that the Souls in departing out of the Body do pa&s;s into the&s;e places, as the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> thought that they went into Hell: they are born, according to them, at the places where they go; and there they do live a life, which from us is conceal'd, but which is &s;ubject to the infir|mities of this, and unto death. Death and a new Birth are always the road from one of the&s;e places to another, and it is not till after having lived in a cer|tain number of places, and during a certain time, which ordinarily extends to &s;ome thou&s;ands of years, that the Souls there puni&s;hed or recompenced, do hap|pen to &s;pring up again in the World wherein we are.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="72">Now as they &s;uppo&s;e that the Souls have a new habitation in the places where they revive, they think they &s;tand in need of the things of this Life;<NOTE PLACE="marg">To live a life full of Cares like this.</NOTE> and all the ancient Pagani&s;m believed the &s;ame. With the body of a dead man, the <HI>Gauls</HI> burnt the things which he had mo&s;t e&s;teemed, during his Life, Move|ables, Animals, Slaves, and even free Per&s;ons, if he had any &s;ingularly devoted to his Service.</P>
<P>They &s;till practice wor&s;e than this, if it is po&s;&s;ible,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Indi|an</HI> women burn them|&s;elvs with the body of their Husband.</NOTE> among the Pagans of the true <HI>India,</HI> where the Wife glories in burning her&s;elf alive with the body of her Husband, to meet his Soul in the other world. I well know that &s;ome pre&s;ume that this Cu&s;tom was formerly introduced in the <HI>Indies,</HI> to &s;ecure the Husbands from the Trea&s;on of their Wives, by forcing them to die with them. <HI>Mande&s;h</HI> reports this opinion, and <HI>Strabo</HI> had reported it before him, and had di&s;approved it, thinking it improbable either that &s;uch a Law was e&s;tabli&s;hed, or that &s;uch a rea&s;on for e&s;tabli&s;hing it was true: Indeed, be&s;ides that this Cu|&s;tom is extended to the Moveables and Animals, things all innocent, it is free in regard of the Women, none of which dies after this manner, if &s;he de&s;ires it not; and it has been received in too great a part of the Country, to imagine that the Crimes of the Women have given occa&s;ion thereunto. Wives to be Slaves, or as Slaves to their Husbands, are not either more di&s;&s;atisfied with their Condition, nor greater Enemies to their Husbands, and they change no part of the Condition as to this regard, by a &s;econd Marriage. Thus it is ob&s;erved that the <HI>Indian</HI> Women have always look'd upon the Liberty they have of dying with their Husbands, not as a Puni&s;hment, but as a Felicity which is offered them. The Wo|men Slaves do &s;ometimes follow their Mi&s;tre&s;s to the Funeral Pile, but volun|tarily and without compul&s;ion. And moreover it is not a thing without pre|cedent in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that an Husband enamour'd with his Wife, will burn him&s;elf with her, in hopes of going to enjoy another Life with her.</P>
<P><HI>Navarette</HI> reports it is a Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">This Cu&s;tom is received a|mong the <HI>Tar|tars,</HI> and is not without exam|ple among the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></NOTE> that when there dies one among&s;t them, one of his Wives hangs her&s;elf, to follow him into the other World; but that the <HI>Tartar</HI> which reigned at <HI>China</HI> in 1668. aboli&s;hed this Cu&s;tom: and he adds, that though it be not common to the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> nor ap|proved by <HI>Confucius,</HI> yet it is not without example. He relates one in his time, of the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton,</HI> who being poy&s;oned him&s;elf, and feeling the ap|proach of Death, called her whom he loved the be&s;t of his Wives, and de&s;ired her to follow him: which &s;he did by hanging her&s;elf &s;o &s;oon as he was dead.</P>
<P>But certainly neither the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> nor the <HI>Tonquine&s;es,</HI> nor the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Oecono|my of the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> and of their Neigh|bors in Buri|als.</NOTE> nor the other <HI>Indians</HI> beyond the <HI>Ganges,</HI> have ever, as it is known, received the Cu&s;tom of permitting the Women to burn: and moreover they have by a wi&s;e Oeconomy e&s;tabli&s;hed, that in&s;tead of real Furniture and Money, it &s;hould &s;uf|fice to burn with the dead bodies, tho&s;e very things delineated in paper cut, and oftentimes painted or gilded: under pretence, in my opinion, that in matter of Types, tho&s;e of the things in Paper were as good as tho&s;e of the things them|&s;elves, which the Paper repre&s;ents. Wherefore the People report, that this Paper which is burnt, is converted in the other Life to the things which it re|pre&s;ents. The riche&s;t <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> cea&s;e not to burn at lea&s;t &s;ome real Stuffs, and they burn moreover &s;o much Paper, that this expence alone is con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Oriental People do not only believe that they may be helpful to the dead, as I have already explained:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The power of the Dead over the Living, the Source of the wor&s;hip of the Dead.</NOTE> they think al&s;o that the dead have the power of tormenting and &s;uccouring the living: and from hence comes their Care and Magnificence in Funerals; for it is only in this that they are magni|ficent. Hence it comes al&s;o that they pray to the dead, and e&s;pecially the <HI>Ma|nes</HI> of their Ance&s;tors to the Great-Grand-Father, or to the Great-Great-Grand-Father; pre&s;uming that the re&s;t are &s;o di&s;per&s;ed by divers Tran&s;migrations, that they can hear them no more.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea&s;on of &s;peaking of the Burials of the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></NOTE>THE Burials of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are de&s;cribed in &s;everal Relations, but I &s;hall not forbear &s;peaking a word thereof, to render tho&s;e of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> more intelligible; becau&s;e that the Cu&s;toms of a Country do always better illu&s;trate them&s;elves, by the compari&s;on of the Cu&s;toms of the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What are the Principal Cir|cum&s;tances thereof.</NOTE>The fir&s;t care of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> in Burials is to have a Coffin of precious Wood; in which they do &s;ometimes make an expence above their Fortune: and though they bury their bodies without burning them, they forbear not, at their Inter|ment, to burn Goods, Hou&s;es, Animals, Money, and whatever is nece&s;&s;ary to the Conveniences of Life; but all in Paper, except &s;ome real Stuffs which are burnt at the Funerals of the rich. Father <HI>Semedo</HI> reports, that at the Burial of a Queen of <HI>China</HI> her goods were really burnt. The &s;econd care of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> in Burials is, to chu&s;e out a place proper for the Tomb. They chu&s;e it accord|ing to the advice of the Sooth&s;ayers, imagining that the repo&s;e of the decea&s;ed depends on this choice, and that of the felicity and repo&s;e of the living depends on the repo&s;e of the dead. If therefore they are not the Proprietors of the place declared by the Sooth&s;ayers, they fail not to buy it, and &s;ometimes dearly. And in the third place, be&s;ides the Funeral Train, which is great, they give magnificent entertainments to the dead per&s;on, not only when they bury him, but annually on the &s;ame day, and &s;everal times in the year.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The wor&s;hip of the Dead.</NOTE>In their Hou&s;e they have a Chamber de&s;igned for the <HI>Manes</HI> of their An|ce&s;tors, where from time to time they go to render the &s;ame Devotions to their Figure, as they render'd to their Body in interring it. They do again burn Perfumes, Stuffs, and cut Papers; and they do make them new repa&s;ts. The <HI>Tonquine&s;es,</HI> according to Father <HI>de Rhodes,</HI> do intermix the&s;e &s;orts of repa&s;ts with Paper-meats, which they burn. The &s;ame Author very largely relates the Prayers which the <HI>Tonquine&s;es</HI> make to the dead, how they demand of them a long and happy Life; with what zeal they redouble their Wor&s;hip and Prayers in their Misfortunes, when the Sooth&s;ayers a&s;&s;ure them that they ought to attribute the cau&s;e thereof to the Anger of their Parents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> at pre&s;ent are en|tirely impious.</NOTE>Several Relations of <HI>China</HI> a&s;&s;ert, that the learned men, which in this Coun|try are the mo&s;t important Citizens, do con&s;ider the Ceremonies of Funerals, only as civil Duties, to which they add no Prayers: That at pre&s;ent they have not any &s;en&s;e of Religion, and do not believe the exi&s;tence of any God, nor the Immortality of the Soul; and that tho they render unto <HI>Confucius</HI> an exterior Wor&s;hip in the Temples which are con&s;ecrated to him, yet they demand not of him the Knowledge, which the learned Men of <HI>Tonquin</HI> demand of him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Doctrine of the Ancient <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> on the wor&s;hip of the Dead, and that it is very probable that they never prayed to the dead in Fune|rals.</NOTE>But, whether the Funerals which the learned <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do make for their Pa|rents be without Prayers, or not; it is certain that the ancient Spirit of the Doctrine of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> was to believe the Immortality of the Soul, to expect good and evil from the dead, and to addre&s;s &s;ome Prayers unto them, if not in Burials, at lea&s;t in the di&s;graces of Life to attract their protection. Moreover, what opinion &s;oever they have had of the Power of the dead to &s;uccor the liv|ing, it is very probable that they thought, that the dead were in need at the moment of the Burial, that is to &s;ay in the Entrance and E&s;tabli&s;hment of another Life, and that it then belonged to the living to &s;uccor the dead, and not to de|mand &s;uccor of them.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="73">But it is time to relate what the Funerals of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Burials of the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></NOTE> So &s;oon as a man is dead his body is &s;hut up in a wooden Coffin, which is varni&s;hed and gild|ed on the out&s;ide: and as the Varni&s;h of <HI>Siam</HI> is not &s;o good as that of <HI>China,</HI> and hinders not the &s;tench of the dead body from pa&s;&s;ing through the cracks of the Coffin, they endeavour at lea&s;t to con&s;ume the Inte&s;tines of the dead with Mercury, which they pour into his Mouth, and which, they &s;ay, comes out at the Fundament. They &s;ometimes make u&s;e al&s;o of Leaden Coffins, and &s;ome|times al&s;o they gild them: but the Wood of their Coffins is not &s;o precious as at <HI>China,</HI> becau&s;e they are not &s;o rich as the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> Out of a re&s;pect they place the Coffin on &s;ome high thing, and generally on a Bed&s;ted which hath feet, and &s;o long as the body is kept at the hou&s;e, whether to expect the Head of the Family, if he is ab&s;ent, or to prepare the Funeral Solemnities, they burn Per|fumes and Tapers by the Coffin; and every night the <HI>Talapoins</HI> come to &s;ing in the <HI>Balie</HI> Language, in the Chamber where it is expo&s;ed: they do range them|&s;elves along the Walls. They entertain them, and give them &s;ome Money: and what they &s;ing are &s;ome moral Subjects upon Death, with the Road to Heaven, which they pretend to &s;how to the Soul of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mean while the Family chu&s;es a place in the Field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they burn the bo|dies.</NOTE> there to carry and burn the body. This place is generally a Spot near the Temple, which the Decea&s;ed, or &s;ome of his Ance&s;tors had built; or near &s;ome other Temple, if there is none peculiar to the Family of the decea&s;ed, This &s;pace is inclo&s;ed with a &s;quare inclo&s;ure made of <HI>Bambou,</HI> with &s;ome kind of Architecture, almo&s;t of the &s;ame work as the Arbours and Bowers of our Gardens, and adorned with tho&s;e Papers Painted or Gilded, which they cut to repre&s;ent the Hou&s;es, Move|ables, and Dome&s;tic and Savage Animals. In the middle of this Inclo&s;ure the Pile compo&s;ed entirely or partly of Odoriferous wood, as are the white or yellow Saunders, and Lignum Aloes, and this according to the Wealth and Dignity of the decea&s;ed. But the greate&s;t honor of the Funeral con&s;i&s;ts in erect|ing the Pile, not in eagerly heaping up Wood, but in great Scaffolds, on which they do put Earth, and then Wood. At the Burial of the late Queen, who died &s;even or eight years ago, the Scaffold was higher than ever was yet &s;een in this Country, and a Machine was de&s;ired of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> to rai&s;e the Coffin decently to that heighth.</P>
<P>When it is re&s;olved to carry the Corps to the Pile (which is always done in the Morning) the Parents and Friends do carry it with the &s;ound of a great ma|ny In&s;truments. The Body marches fir&s;t, then the Family of the decea&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Train.</NOTE> Men and Women all cloathed in White, their Head covered with a White Vail, and lamenting exceedingly; and in fine, the re&s;t of the Friends and Re|lations. If the Train can go all the way by water, it is &s;o done. In very magnificent Funerals they carry great Machines of Bambou covered with paint|ed and gilded Paper, which repre&s;ents not only Palaces, Moveables, Elephants, and other common Animals, but &s;ome hideous Mon&s;ters, &s;ome of which re|&s;emble the humane Figure, and which the Chri&s;tians take for the Figures of Devils. They burn not the Coffin, but they take out the body which they leave on the Pile: and the <HI>Talapoins</HI> of the Convent, near which the body is burnt, do &s;ing for a quarter of an hour, and then retire to appear no more. Then begin the &s;hows of the <HI>Cone</HI> and of the <HI>Rabam,</HI> which are at the &s;ame time, and all the day long, but on different Theaters. The <HI>Talapoins</HI> think not that they can be pre&s;ent thereat without Sin; and the&s;e Shows are not exhibited at Fune|rals upon any religious Account, but only to render them more magnificent. To the Ceremony they add a fe&s;tival Air, and yet the Relations of the decea&s;ed forbear not to make great Lamentations, and to &s;hed many Tears, but they hire no Mourners, as &s;ome have a&s;&s;ured me.</P>
<P>About Noon the <HI>Tapacaou,</HI> or Servant of the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> &s;ets fire to the Pile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Servant of the <HI>Tala|poins</HI> lights the Funeral Pile.</NOTE> which generally burns for two hours. The Fire never con&s;umes the body, it only roa&s;ts it, and oftentimes very ill: but it is always reputed for the Honor of the decea&s;ed, that he has been wholly con&s;umed in an eminent place, and that there remains only his A&s;hes. If it is the Body of a Prince of the Blood, or of a Lord whom the King has loved, the King him&s;elf &s;ets fire to the Pile,
<PB N="124" REF="74">
without &s;tirring out of his Palace. He lets go a lighted Torch along a Rope, which is extended from one of the Windows of the Palace to the Pile. As to the cut Papers, which are naturally de&s;igned for the Flames, the <HI>Talapoins</HI> do frequently &s;ecure them, and &s;eize them to lend them to other Funerals; and the Family of the decea&s;ed permits them to do it. In which it appears that they have forgot the rea&s;on, why the neighbouring Nations di&s;pence not from burn|ing &s;uch Papers effectually: and in general it may be a&s;&s;erted, that there are no Per&s;ons in the world, which do ignore their own Religion &s;o much as the <HI>Tala|poins.</HI> It is very difficult, &s;ay &s;ome, to find any one among&s;t them that knows any thing. It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek their Opinions in the <HI>Balie</HI> Books, which they keep, and which they &s;tudy very little.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Alms at Fune|rals.</NOTE>The Family of the decea&s;ed entertains the Train, and for three days it be|&s;tows Alms: <HI>viz.</HI> On the day that the body is burnt, to the <HI>Talapoins</HI> which have &s;ung over the body, the next day to their whole Convent, and the third day to their Temple.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Funerals re|doubled.</NOTE>This is what is practi&s;ed at the Funerals of the <HI>Siame&s;es:</HI> to which it is requi|&s;ite only to add, that they imbelli&s;h the Show with a great many Fire-works, and that if the Funerals are for a man of great con&s;equence, they la&s;t with the &s;ame Shows for three days.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bodies dug up to receive greater Fune|ral Honors.</NOTE>It &s;ometimes al&s;o happens that a Per&s;on of great Quality cau&s;es the body of his Father to be digged up again, though a long time dead, to make him a pompous Funeral; if when he died, they made him not &s;uch a one, as was worthy of the pre&s;ent Elevation of the Son. This participates of the Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who communicate as much as they can to their dead Relations, the Honors to which they arrive. Thus when a man not born a Kings Son arrives at the Crown of <HI>China,</HI> he will with certain Ceremonies cau&s;e the Ti|tle of King to be given to his decea&s;ed Father.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">What the fire con&s;umes not, is buried under Pyramids: and how the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> do call the&s;e Pyra|mids.</NOTE>After the body of a <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> has been burnt, as I have &s;aid, the whole Show is ended; they &s;hut up the remains of his Body in the Coffin, without any Or|der; and this depo&s;itum is laid under one of tho&s;e Pyramids, wherewith they encompa&s;s their Temples. Sometimes al&s;o they bury precious Stones, and other Riches with the body, becau&s;e that it is to put them in a place which Re|ligion renders inviolable. Some there are who &s;ay, that they ca&s;t the A&s;hes of their Kings into the River, and I have read of the <HI>Peguins,</HI> that they make a Pa&s;te of the A&s;hes of their Kings with Milk, and that they bury it at the mouth of their River when the Sea is retired: but as the Fire never con&s;umes all, and as it principally &s;pares the Bones, the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> and <HI>Peguins</HI> do put the&s;e remains of their Kings under Pyramids. The&s;e Pyramids are called <HI>Pra Tchiai di. Pra</HI> is that <HI>Baly</HI> Term, which I have frequently mentioned. <HI>Tchiai-di</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Good Heart,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>Contentment,</HI> as I have explained it in the other part: So that <HI>Pra Tchiai-di</HI> amounts to the&s;e words <HI>&s;acred repo&s;e,</HI> as much as tho&s;e of Repo&s;e and Contentment do re&s;emble.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From whence came the fan|cy of Pyra|mids for Tombs.</NOTE>A Tomb quite flat like ours would not in their opinion be honourable enough, they mu&s;t have &s;omething of Eminence: and this is the fancy of the Pyramids of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the <HI>Mau&s;olea.</HI> Some People yet more vain have joyned Epitaphs thereto: and becau&s;e that time effaces the In&s;criptions, which are expo&s;ed to view, others have &s;ecretly put their names on the principal Stones of certain &s;tately edifices: So that when they are di&s;covered, their work is already demo|li&s;hed to the Foundation. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> &s;till keep to the fir&s;t degree of Vanity, which is &s;ingle Pyramids without any Epitaph, and &s;o &s;lightly erected, that tho&s;e which la&s;t longe&s;t, do never la&s;t an Age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> love to build Tem|ples.</NOTE>Tho&s;e that have neither Temple nor Pyramid, do &s;ometimes keep at their hou&s;e the ill burnt remains of their Parents: But there hardly is a <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> rich enough to build a Temple, who does it not, and who buries not the Riches he has remaining. The Temples are inviolable Sanctuaries, as I have &s;aid, and the Kings of <HI>Siam,</HI> as well as particular per&s;ons, commit their Trea&s;ures to them. I know that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have demanded &s;ome &s;mooth Files of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> to cut the great Iron Bars which linked the Stones in the Temples, under which there was Gold concealed. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> which have not wherewith to build a
<PB N="125" REF="74">
Temple, cea&s;e not at lea&s;t to make &s;ome Idol, which they give to &s;ome of the Temples already built: Which in the&s;e People is a &s;entiment of Vanity or Religion, whereas the building of Temples may be as much the Intere&s;t of pre|&s;erving their Riches to their Family, as any other thing.</P>
<P>The Poor interr their Parents without burning them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Funerals of the Poor.</NOTE> but if it is po&s;&s;ible for them, they invite the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> who &s;tir not without a Gratuity. Tho&s;e that have not wherewithal to pay the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> do think they do honor enough to their dead Parents, to expo&s;e them in the Field on an eminent place; that is to &s;ay on a Scaffold, where the Vulturs and the Crows devour them.</P>
<P>I have already &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Funeral ho|nors retarded.</NOTE> that in Epidemical Di&s;tempers they bury the Bodies without burning them; and that they dig them up and burn them &s;ome years after, when they think all the danger of the Infection is pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But they never burn tho&s;e that Ju&s;tice cuts off, nor Infants dead-born,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho&s;e that are deprived of Funeral Ho|nors.</NOTE>
nor Women that die in Child-bed, nor tho&s;e which drown them&s;elves, or which peri&s;h by any other extraordinary di&s;a&s;ter, as by a Thunderbolt. They rank the&s;e unfortunate per&s;ons among&s;t the guilty, becau&s;e they believe that &s;uch Misfortunes never happen to innocent Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Mourning at <HI>China</HI> is pre&s;cirbed by the Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mourning.</NOTE> and that for the Father and Mo|ther la&s;ts three years, and deprives or bereaves the Son during this time, of all &s;orts of publick Employment, if it is not Military: though to me it &s;eems that this exception as to Millitary Employments, is a late e&s;tabli&s;hment. On the contrary, the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have no forced Mourning: they give marks of Sor|row only as much as they are Afflicted; &s;o that it is more common at <HI>Siam,</HI> that the Father and the Mother put on Mourning for their Children, than that the Children wear it for their Father and Mother. Sometimes the Father turns <HI>Talapoin</HI> and the Mother <HI>Talapoine&s;&s;e,</HI> or at lea&s;t they &s;have the head one of the other: but there is only the true <HI>Talapoins,</HI> that can likewi&s;e &s;have the Eye-brows.</P>
<P>To me it appeared not that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> invoke their dead Parents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whether the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> pray to the Dead.</NOTE> what en|quiry &s;oever I have made upon it; but they cea&s;e not to believe them&s;elves frequently tormented with their Apparitions: and then they carry Viands to their Tombs, which the Bea&s;ts do eat; and they give Alms for them to the <HI>Ta|lapoins,</HI> becau&s;e they think that Charity is a Ran&s;om for the Sins of the dead, as well as of the living. Be&s;ides this the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> almo&s;t on all occa&s;ions, do offer up Prayers to the good <HI>Genij,</HI> and imprecations again&s;t the bad, of which I have already given &s;ome examples; And the&s;e <HI>Genij</HI> are certainly in their opi|nion only Souls, all as I have &s;aid, of the &s;ame Nature.</P>
<P>The wicked <HI>Genij</HI> are the Souls of tho&s;e, which dye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How it mu&s;t be under&s;tood that the Souls of the Good are changed into Angels, and the Souls of the wicked into Devils.</NOTE> either by the hand of Ju&s;tice, or by &s;ome of tho&s;e extraordinary misfortunes, which make them to be judged unworthy of Funeral Honors. The good <HI>Genij</HI> are all the other Souls, e&s;teemed more or le&s;s good, according as they have been more or le&s;s Virtuous in this life. And this wholly re&s;embles the Opinion of <HI>Plato,</HI> who requires that one &s;hould adhere to Vertue during life, to the end that the cu&s;tom thereof may continue after death. This amounts likewi&s;e to that Antient O|pinion, which was &s;pread al&s;o among&s;t &s;ome of the Antient Chri&s;tians, that the Souls of the good are changed into Angels, and the Souls of the wicked in|to Devils. But among&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> this doctrine is no other, than that the Souls of the good, &s;pring up again after Death, in one of tho&s;e places, which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have called <HI>Paradice,</HI> and the Souls of the wicked, in one of tho&s;e other places, which they do call <HI>Hell.</HI> Some continuing to be good after Death, do good to men, others continuing to be wicked, do hurt to men, and every thing el&s;e, as much as they can. And who knows whether the&s;e &s;eve|ral <HI>Paradices</HI> which they believe, are not a confu&s;ed remembrance of the &s;eve|ral Orders of the Cele&s;tial Spirits.</P>
<P>Now through an incredible blindne&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Indians</HI> have no God which is the Judge of Hu|mane Actions.</NOTE> the <HI>Indians</HI> admit not any Intelligent Being, which judges of the goodne&s;s or badne&s;s of Humane actions, and which orders the Puni&s;hment or Recompence thereof. Upon this account they ad|mit only a blind fatalility, which, &s;ay they, is the rea&s;on that Pro&s;perity accom|panies Vertue, and Misfortune Vice; as it determines heavy things to de&s;cend,
<PB N="126" REF="75">
and light things to a&s;cend. And becau&s;e that nothing more repugns rea&s;on, than to &s;uppo&s;e an exact Ju&s;tice in chance, or in the Nece&s;&s;ity of Fate, the <HI>Indi|an</HI> People incline them&s;elves to believe &s;omething Corporeal in good or bad works, which, they &s;ay, has the power of doing unto men, the Good or Evil which they de&s;erve. But &s;ince we have often &s;aid, that the <HI>Indians</HI> do own the di&s;tinction of good or bad Works, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;et down the Principles of of their Morality.</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Kill nothing.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. Commit not any impurity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Lye not.</ITEM>

</LIST>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fir&s;t Pre|cept extends to Plants and Seeds.</NOTE>The fir&s;t Precept is not limited to the Killing either Men or Animals: but it extends to Plants, and to Seeds; becau&s;e that by a very probable Opinion, they believe that the Seed is only the Plant it &s;elf in a Cover. The Man therefore ob&s;erving this Precept, as they under&s;tand it, can live only on Fruit; fora&s;|much as they con&s;ider the Fruit not as a thing which has Life, but as a part of a thing which has Life, and which &s;uffers not, though its Fruit be pluck'd. In eating the Fruit it is nece&s;&s;ary only not to eat the Kernel nor Stone, becau&s;e they are Seeds: and it is nece&s;&s;ary not to eat Fruit out of &s;ea&s;on, that is to &s;ay, in my opinion, before the Sea&s;on; becau&s;e that it is to make the Seed, which the Fruit contains, abortive, by hindering it from ripening.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And to the not de&s;troying any thing in Na|ture.</NOTE>Be&s;ides this, the Precept of not killing, extends to the not de&s;troying any thing in Nature: by rea&s;on they think that every thing is animated, or if you will, that there are Souls every where, and that to de&s;troy any thing what|ever, is forceably to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s a Soul. They will not, for in&s;tance, break a Branch of a Tree, as they will not break the Arm of an innocent Per&s;on. They believe that it is to offend the Soul of the Tree. But when once the Soul has been expelled out of a body, they look upon this as a De&s;truction already wrought, and think nothing to be de&s;troyed in nouri&s;hing them&s;elves with this Body. The <HI>Talapoins</HI> make not any &s;cruple of eating what is dead, but of kil|ling what they think alive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In &s;everal things they do more abhor Blood than Murder.</NOTE>In &s;everal things they te&s;tify a greater Abhorrence of Blood, than of Murder: It is prohibited them to make any Inci&s;ion, from whence there gu&s;hes out Blood; as if the Soul was principally in the Blood, or that it was only the Blood. And this perhaps is a confu&s;ed remembrance of the ancient Command of God, who permitting unto man the u&s;e of Meats, prohibited him from eating the Blood of the Animals, <HI>becau&s;e that the Blood &s;upplys in them the place of the Soul.</HI> There are &s;ome <HI>Indians</HI> which dare not to cut a certain Plant, becau&s;e there comes out a red Juice, which they take for the Blood of this Plant. The <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> do &s;cruple to go a fi&s;hing, only on the days when the <HI>Talapoins</HI> &s;have their Head. This done, it &s;eems to them that when they fi&s;h, they commit no Crime; by rea&s;on they think not them&s;elves guilty of the Death of the Fi&s;hes. They &s;ay they only pull them out of the Water, and &s;hed not their Blood. The lea&s;t eva&s;ion &s;ufficeth them to elude the Precepts. Thus they think not to &s;in by killing in War, becau&s;e they &s;hoot not direct at the Enemy: though at the bottom they endeavour to kill, as I have already explained it, di&s;cour&s;ing of their manner of fighting.</P>

Murder oftentimes appears laudable, &s;eeing that it may deliver a Soul from a mi&s;erable Life: They an&s;wer that forceably to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s Souls is always to offend them; and that moreover they are not relieved, becau&s;e they re enter into the like Bodies, there to fill up the re&s;t of the time, during which they are de&s;igned for this &s;ort of Life. But they con&s;ider not that this rea&s;on would al&s;o prove that they did no real Injury in killing: and the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> who in this do think otherwi&s;e than the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> do kill their Children when they have too many, and they alledge that it is to make them &s;pring up more happy.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To kill them|&s;elves appears to them a ve|ry laudable thing.</NOTE></P>
<P>Moreover all the <HI>Indians</HI> do think, that to kill them&s;elves is not only a thing permitted, becau&s;e they believe them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their &s;elves; but that it is a Sacrifice advantageous to the Soul, and which acquires it a great degree of Vertue and Felicity. Thus the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do &s;ometimes hang them&s;elves out of Devotion, on a Tree which in <HI>Balie</HI> they call <HI>Pra &s;a maha Pout,</HI> and in <HI>Siame&s;e Ton po.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Balie</HI> words do &s;eem to &s;ignifie the <HI>excellent,</HI> or the <HI>holy Tree</HI> of the great <HI>Mercury;</HI> for <HI>Pout</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Mercury,</HI> in the <HI>Balie</HI> Name of <HI>Wedne&s;day.</HI> The <HI>Europeans</HI> do call this Tree, <HI>the Tree of the Pagodes,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do plant it before the Pagods.

But in that Zeal which &s;ometimes determines the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> to hang them&s;elves, there is always &s;ome evident &s;ubject of a great di|&s;ta&s;te of Life, or of a great Fear, as is that of the Anger of the Prince.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Story of a <HI>Peguin</HI> which burnt him&s;elf.</NOTE></P>

After the Fire had &s;mother'd and roa&s;ted him well, his body was covered with a kind of Plai&s;ter; and thereof they made a Statue which was gilded and put up|on the Altar, behind that of the <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> They call the&s;e &s;orts of Saints <HI>Pra tian tee; tian</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>true, tee</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>certainly.</HI> Behold then how the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> under&s;tand the fir&s;t Precept of their Moral Law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Prohibi|tion of Impu|rity extends to the Prohibiti|on of Marri|age.</NOTE></P>

Not on|ly Celibacy is among&s;t them a &s;tate of Perfection, but Marriage is a &s;tate of Sin: either through that Spirit of Mode&s;ty, which among&s;t all Nations is an|next to the u&s;e of Marriage, and which &s;eems therein to &s;uppo&s;e an evil where|at they blu&s;h: or through a general Aver&s;ion to all natural indecencies, &s;ome of which were legal Impurities among the <HI>Jews.</HI> They wa&s;h them&s;elves among&s;t certain People after having &s;een their Wives, as after &s;ome other &s;ort of Pollution. <HI>Mahomet</HI> thought Women unworthy of Paradice, and without declaring what they &s;hall become, he promi&s;es &s;ome fairer and more beautiful to his Elect.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Philo&s;ophers e&s;teem Di|vorce a Virtu|ous Action.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Philo&s;ophers do &s;ay, that a Wife is a thing evil in it&s;elf, and that one mu&s;t neither keep his own, nor take another, when he has Children, that may render unto their Parents from whom they are born, and to their Ance&s;tors, the Duties which the Chri&s;tian Religion thinks nece&s;&s;ary to the repo&s;e of the dead. Without this pretended nece&s;&s;ity they would believe Marriage unlawful, and &s;o &s;oon as they have Children, they think it a Vertue to make a Divorce. They cite the example of <HI>Confucius,</HI> who quitted his Wife when he had a Son: they alledge the example of this Son, who likewi&s;e quitted his; and the exam|ple and opinion of &s;everal other <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Philo&s;ophers, who have made a Divorce with their Wives, and who have e&s;teemed the Divorce among&s;t the virtuous Actions. They condemn as a Corruption of the ancient manners of <HI>China,</HI> the Opi|nion of the modern <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> People, who as well as the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> guided by the &s;en|timents of Nature, look upon Divorce, if not as an Evil, at lea&s;t as a Misfortune. I know nothing concerning the fourth Precept, which de&s;erves to be explained.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="76"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Every Liquor which intoxi|cates, is prohi|bited.</NOTE>The fifth not only prohibits intoxicating, but the drinking of any Liquor, which may intoxicate, though one makes not him&s;elf drunk therewith. They e&s;teem a thing evil in it&s;elf, which may hurt by the quantity.</P>
<P>'Tis thus that they under&s;tand their Precepts, neither do they believe that real Vertue is made for every one, but only for the <HI>Talapoins.</HI> They think that what is Sin in it&s;elf, is Sin for all; and the <HI>Talapoins</HI> make neither Vow, nor any thing whatever, which is a Sin in them, which is not a Sin to all the World; but according to them, the Trade of Seculars is to &s;in, and that of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> not to &s;in, and to exerci&s;e Repentance for tho&s;e that &s;in. They comprehend like us, that tho&s;e who are de&s;igned to expiate the Sins of others by Repentance, ought to be more pure than others; and that the Puni&s;hment due and nece&s;&s;a|rily annext to Sin, may yet pa&s;s from the guilty to the innocent, if the innocent will willingly &s;ubmit him&s;elf to deliver the guilty. Moreover they conceive the Nature of Sin very gro&s;ly, and very materially; for the <HI>Talapoins</HI> content them|&s;elves with ab&s;taining from Actions which they think wicked, but they &s;cruple not to make the Seculars commit them, to get Advantage thereby. Thus when they would eat Rice, Rice being a Seed they cannot boil it without Sin, becau&s;e it is to kill it: But they make their <HI>Tapacaou,</HI> which are their Dome&s;tic Seculars, or rather they cau&s;e the <HI>Talapoin-Children,</HI> which they educate, to commit this pretended Sin; and when the Rice is boiled, then they eat it. They are al&s;o prohibited to pi&s;s on the Fire, or in the Water, or on the Earth, becau&s;e that this would be to extingui&s;h the Fire, or to corrupt tho&s;e two other Elements: they pi&s;s in &s;ome Ve&s;&s;el, and a Secular Servant pours it where he plea&s;es, and it matters not whether he &s;ins. The Seculars do therefore ob&s;erve, or elude the Precepts only through the fear of the publick Cha&s;ti&s;ements, or through the natural &s;trangene&s;s which they might have to what they &s;hall think Sin; but they ran&s;om their Sins by their good Works, which principally con&s;i&s;t in be&s;towing Alms on the Temples and <HI>Talapoins,</HI> according to the ancient Tradi|tion known perhaps throughout the Earth, and &s;o frequently repeated in the Holy Scripture, that Alms deeds ran&s;om Sins. It is ea&s;ie al&s;o to ob&s;erve in them a very natural and very ju&s;t &s;entiment, which is that they much more condemn the Sins which may be ea&s;ily avoided, than tho&s;e which are inevitable, though they think that all are Sins. But to the end that the Morality of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> may be better under&s;tood, I will in&s;ert at the end of this Work, mo&s;t of their Maxims verbatim, as they were given me.

There we &s;hall &s;ee that they take care of Purity and Decency, as much as of real Virtue: that they have &s;ome Idea's of almo&s;t all the Virtues, and that they have hardly any that is exact; becau&s;e they carry &s;ome to &s;uper&s;titious &s;cruples, and that they live &s;hort of others.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vertue accor|ding to them is impo&s;&s;ible.</NOTE>Moreover the&s;e Maxims are only for the <HI>Talapoins;</HI> not that they think that any per&s;on can violate them without Sin: but it is that they &s;ee it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one not to infringe them: as for example, it is very nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome per&s;on make the Fire. They are &s;urprized at the Beauty of our Morality, when it is told them that it equally invites all men to Vertue, becau&s;e they compre|hend not that this can be a thing practicable: but when they are made to un|der&s;tand it, and are informed that Vertue con&s;i&s;ts not in tho&s;e impo&s;&s;ible things, wherein they place it, they contemn what is told them, and do believe them|&s;elves more pure and virtuous than the Chri&s;tians: or rather they return again to believe that they alone are <HI>Creeng,</HI> that is to &s;ay pure, and that the Chri&s;tians are <HI>Cahat,</HI> or de&s;igned to &s;in, like the re&s;t of Mankind: A prevention which mu&s;t quite confound us, and which proves the extream nece&s;&s;ity which humane rea&s;on has of a &s;uperior Light, not to err in the knowledge of good and evil, the Idea's of which do neverthele&s;s appear unto us &s;o ea&s;ie, and &s;o natural.</P>

<P>IT remains for me to explain wherein they place perfect Felicity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perfect Feli|city.</NOTE> that is to &s;ay, the &s;upream Recompence of good Works, and the utmo&s;t Degree of Unhappine&s;s, that is to &s;ay the greate&s;t Puni&s;hment of the Guilty. They be|lieve therefore that if by &s;everal Tran&s;migrations, and by a great number of good Works in all the Lives, a Soul acquires &s;o much Merit, that there is not in any World any mortal Condition, that is worthy of it; they believe, I &s;ay, that this Soul is then exempt from every Tran&s;migration, and every Animation, that it has nothing more to do; that it neither revives, nor dies any more; but that it enjoys an eternal Unactivity, and a real Impa&s;&s;ibility. <HI>Nireupan,</HI> &s;ay they, that is to &s;ay this Soul has di&s;appeared: it will return no more in any World:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What the <HI>Por|tugue&s;es</HI> have called <HI>Para|dice</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> are neither the Perfect Felici|ty, nor the ex|tream Infelici|ty, according to the <HI>Siame&s;es.</HI></NOTE> and 'tis this word which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have tran&s;lated <HI>it is annihila|ted;</HI> and likewi&s;e thus, <HI>It is become a God,</HI> though in the Opinion of the <HI>Siame|&s;es,</HI> this is not a real Annihilation, nor an Acqui&s;ition of any divine Nature.</P>
<P>Such is therefore the true Paradice of the <HI>Indians:</HI> for tho' they &s;uppo&s;e a great Felicity in the highe&s;t of the nine Paradices, of which we have already di&s;cour&s;ed; yet they &s;ay that this Felicity is not eternal, nor exempt from all Inquietude; &s;eeing that it is a kind of life, where one is born, and where one

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The utmo&s;t degree of In|felicity.</NOTE>But the true Hell of the <HI>Indians</HI> is only, as I have already &s;aid, the eternal Tran&s;migrations of the&s;e Souls, which will never arrive at the <HI>Nireupan,</HI> that is to &s;ay, will never <HI>di&s;appear</HI> in the whole duration of the World, which they do think mu&s;t be eternal.

And all the Spirits appear not good to them; they acknowledge &s;ome wicked ones, to be the immediate cau&s;e of the mi&s;chiefs and di&s;a&s;ters to which the humane life is &s;ubject. Moreover, as they thought the Earth and the Sea fixt to the Heaven by the Horizon, they have attributed but one Spirit or one Soul to the Heaven and the Earth; tho' neverthele&s;s, and perhaps by &s;ome thought contrary to their fir&s;t opinion, they have built two different Temples, the one con&s;ecrated to the Heaven, and the other to the Earth.</P>
<P>As therefore the Soul of Man was, in their opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They have ta|ken from God the infinite Providence and Omnipo|tence.</NOTE> the &s;ource of all the vi|tal Actions of Man; &s;o they gave a Soul unto the Sun, to be the &s;ource of its qualities and of its motions: and on this Principle the Soul's diffu&s;ed every where, cau&s;ing in all Bodies the Actions which appear natural to the&s;e Bodies, there needs no more to explain in this opinion the whole oeconomie of Nature, and to &s;upply the Omnipotence, and infinite Providence, which they admit not in any Spirit, not even in that of the Heaven.</P>

<P>But if the ancient <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have, as I may &s;ay, reduc'd the Providence and Omnipotence of God into piece-meals, they have not le&s;s divided his Ju&s;tice. They a&s;&s;ert that the Spirits, like concealed Mini&s;ters, were principally bu&s;ied in puni&s;hing the hidden faults of men; that the Spirit of Heaven puni&s;hed the faults of the King, the Mini&s;tring Spirits of Heaven the faults of the King's Mi|ni&s;ters, and &s;o of other Spirits in regard of other men.</P>
<P>On this Foundation they &s;aid to their King, that though he was the adoptive Son of Heaven, yet the Heaven would not have any regard to him by any &s;ort of Affliction, but by the &s;ole con&s;ideration of the good or evil, that he &s;hould do in the Government of his Kingdom. They called the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Empire, the <HI>Cele&s;tial Command;</HI> becau&s;e, &s;aid they, a King of <HI>China</HI> ought to govern his State, as Heaven governed Nature, and that it was to Heaven, that he ought to &s;eek the Science of Governing. They acknowledged that not only the Art of Ruling was a Pre&s;ent from Heaven; but that Regality it &s;elf was given by Heaven, and that it was a pre&s;ent difficult to keep; becau&s;e that they &s;uppo&s;ed that Kings could not maintain them&s;elves on the Throne without the &s;avour of Hea|ven, nor plea&s;e Heaven but by Vertue.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">How they be|lieve their Kings re&s;pon|&s;able to Hea|ven for the manners of their Subjects.</NOTE>They carried this Doctrine &s;o far, that they pretended that the &s;ole Vertue of Kings, might render their Subjects Vertuous; and that thereby the Kings were fir&s;t re&s;pon&s;ible to Heaven for the wicked manners of their Kingdom. The Vertue of Kings, that is to &s;ay, the Art of Ruling according to the Laws of <HI>China,</HI> was, in their Opinion a Donative from Heaven, which they called <HI>Cele&s;tial Rea&s;on,</HI> or Rea&s;on given by Heaven, and like to that of Heaven: The Vertue of Subjects, according to them, <HI>the regards of the Citizens, as well from one to another, as from all towards their Prince, according to the Laws of China,</HI> was the work of good Kings.

that is to &s;ay, not feeling the weight of the Royal Authority, no more than the force which moves Nature, and which they attribute to Heaven. They report then that for the&s;e Twenty two years there was not one &s;ingle Proce&s;s in all <HI>China,</HI> nor one &s;ingle Execution of Ju&s;tice; a Wonder which they call <HI>to govern imperceptably like the Heaven,</HI> and which alone may cau&s;e a doubt of the Fidelity of their Hi&s;tory. Another of their Kings meeting, as they &s;ay, a Criminal, which was lead to Puni&s;hment, took it upon him&s;elf, for that under his Reign he committed Crimes worthy of Death. And another &s;eeing <HI>China</HI> afflicted with Sterility for &s;even years, condemned him&s;elf, if their Hi&s;tory may be credited, to bear the Crimes of his People, as thinking him&s;elf only culpable; and re&s;olved to devote him&s;elf to death, and to &s;acrifice him&s;elf to the Spirit of Heaven, the Revenger of the Crimes of Kings. But their Hi&s;tory adds, that Heaven, &s;atisfied with the Piety of that Prince, exempted him from that Sacrifice, and re&s;tored Fertility to the Lands by a &s;udden and plentiful Rain. As the Heaven therefore executes Ju&s;tice only upon the King, and that it in|flicts it only upon the King for what it &s;ees puni&s;hable in the People, the Mi|ni&s;ters of Heaven do execute Ju&s;tice on the &s;ecret Faults which the King's Mini&s;ters commit, and all the Officers which depend upon them: and after the &s;ame manner the other Spirits do watch over the Actions of the Men, that in the Kingdom of <HI>China</HI> have a rank equal to that, which the&s;e Spirits do po&s;|&s;e&s;s in the invincible Monarchy of Nature, whereof the Spirit of Heaven is King.</P>

They every where be|lieve the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is,</HI> and that it is only a way to puni&s;h the Souls for their faults, and to carry them gradually unto Perfection. They believe Spirits every where diffu&s;ed, good and bad, capable of aiding and of hurting, but which are no other than the Souls of the dead; and they admit the Wor&s;hip of the&s;e Spi|rits, though they rai&s;e no Altars to them; but only to the <HI>Manes</HI> of the men, whom they conceive to be arrived at the highe&s;t degree of Vertue, as far as they think Vertue po&s;&s;ible.

They all believe the &s;ame thing of the pretended Dragon which cau&s;es the Eclip&s;es, and of the pretended Mountain, round which the whole Heaven turns, to make the Days and the Nights. They have almo&s;t the &s;ame five Precepts of Morality, they reckon near the &s;ame number of Hells and Para|dice.

They all expect other men, who ought to merit Altars, like tho&s;e to whom they have already con&s;ecrated &s;ome; to the end that every one may have the Field free to pretend to the &s;upream Vertue.

However it be, this cea&s;es not to give attention to the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and has perhaps given occa&s;ion to the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> to believe, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> being the Son of <HI>Mary,</HI> was Brother to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> and that having been crucified, he was that wicked Brother whom they give to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Thevetat,</HI> and whom they report to be puni&s;hed in Hell, with a Puni&s;hment which participates &s;omething of the Cro&s;s. The Father of <HI>Sommona Codom</HI> was, according to this &s;ame <HI>Balie</HI> Book, a King of <HI>Teve Lanca,</HI> that is to &s;ay, a King of the famous <HI>Ceylon.</HI> But the <HI>Balie</HI> Books being without Date, and without the Author's Name, have no more Authority than all the Traditions, who&s;e Origin is unkown. This now is what they relate of <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid, that he be&s;towed all his E&s;tate in Alms, and that his Charity not being yet &s;atisfied, he pluck'd out his Eyes, and &s;lew his Wife and Children, to give them to the <HI>Talapoins</HI> of his Age to eat. A &s;trange contrariety of Idea's in this People, who prohibit nothing &s;o much as to kill, and who relate the mo&s;t execrable Parricides, as the mo&s;t meritorious works of <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> Per|haps they think that under the Title of Property a Man has as much Power over the Lives of his Wife and Children, as to them it &s;eems he has over his own: For it matters not if otherwi&s;e the Royal Authority prohibits particular <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> from making u&s;e of this pretended Right of Life and Death over their Wives, Children and Slaves; whereas it alone exerts it equally over all its Subjects, it may upon this Maxim of the de&s;potic Government, that the Life of the Sub|jects properly belong to the King.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> expect another <HI>Sommona Codom,</HI> I mean another miraculous man like him, whom they already name <HI>Pra Narotte,</HI> and whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have been foretold by <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> And they before-hand report of him, that he &s;hall kill two Children which he &s;hall have, that he will give them to the <HI>Talapoins</HI> to eat, and that it will be by this pious Charity that he will con|&s;ummate his Vertue. This expectation of a new God, to make u&s;e of this Term, renders them careful and credulous, as often as any one is propo&s;ed to them, as an extraordinary Per&s;on; e&s;pecially if he that is propo&s;ed to them, is entirely &s;tupid, becau&s;e that the entire Stupidity re&s;embles what they repre&s;ent by the Inactivity and Impa&s;&s;ibility of the <HI>Nireupan.</HI> As for example, there ap|peared &s;ome years &s;ince at <HI>Siam,</HI> a young Boy born dumb, and &s;o &s;tupid, that he &s;eemed to have nothing humane but the Shape: yet the Report &s;pread it &s;elf
<PB N="137" REF="80">
through the whole Kingdom, that he was of the fir&s;t men, which inhabited this Country, and that he would one day become a God, that is to &s;ay arrive at the <HI>Nireupan.</HI> The People flocked to him from all parts, to adore him and make him Pre&s;ents, till that the King fearing the con&s;equences of this Folly, cau&s;ed it to cea&s;e by the Cha&s;ti&s;ement of &s;ome of tho&s;e, that &s;uffered them&s;elves to be &s;educed. I have read &s;ome &s;uch thing in <HI>To&s;i</HI>'s <HI>India Orientale,</HI> Tom. I. pag. 203. He re|ports that the <HI>Bonzees</HI> of <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> having taken away from them a &s;tupid Infant, &s;how'd him to the People as a God, and that after having inrich'd them|&s;elves with the Pre&s;ents which the People made him, they publi&s;hed that this pretended God would burn him&s;elf; and he adds that they indeed burnt him publickly, after having &s;tupified his Sen&s;es by &s;ome Drink, and calling the in|&s;en&s;ible &s;tate, wherein they had put him, Exta&s;ie. This la&s;t Hi&s;tory is given as a crafty Trick of the <HI>Bonzees,</HI> but it demon&s;trates, as well as the fir&s;t, the Belief which the&s;e People have, that there may daily &s;pring up &s;ome new God, and the Inclination which they have to take extream Stupidity, for a beginning of the <HI>Nireupan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> being di&s;ingaged, by the Alms-deeds which I have mentioned, from all the Bands of Life, devoted him&s;elf to Fa&s;ting, to Prayer, and to the other Exerci&s;es of the perfect Life: But as the&s;e Practi&s;es are po&s;&s;ible only to the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> he embraced the Profe&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Talapoin;</HI> and when he had heap|ed up his good works, he immediately acquired all the Priviledges thereof.</P>
<P>He found him&s;elf endowed with &s;o great a Strength, that in a Duel he van|qui&s;hed another man of a con&s;ummated Vertue, whom they call <HI>Pra Souane,</HI> and who doubting of the Perfection whereunto <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> was arrived, chal|lenged him to try his Strength, and was vanqui&s;ht. This <HI>Pra Souane</HI> is not the &s;ole God, or rather the &s;ole perfect Man, which they pretend to have been contemporary with <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> They name &s;everal others, as <HI>Pra Aria&s;eria,</HI> of whom they report that he was Forty Fadoms high, that his Eyes were three and a half broad, and two and a half round, that is to &s;ay, le&s;s in Circumference than Diameter, if there is no fault in the Writing from whence I have taken this Remark. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have a time of Wonders, as had the <HI>Aegyptians</HI> and the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have. For In&s;tance, their principal Book, which they believe to be the work of <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> relates, that a certain Ele|phant had Three and thirty Heads, that each of its Heads had &s;even Teeth, every Tooth &s;even Pools, every Pool &s;even Flowers, every Flower &s;even Leafs, every Leaf &s;even Towers, and every Tower &s;even other things, which had each &s;even others, and the&s;e likewi&s;e others, and always by &s;even; for the num|bers have always been a great Subject of Super&s;tition. Thus in the Alcoran, if my Memory deceives me not, there is an Angel with a very great number of Heads, each of which hath as many Mouths, and every Mouth as many Tongues, which do prai&s;e God as many times every day.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides corporal &s;trength, <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> had the power of doing all &s;orts of Miracles. For example, he could make him&s;elf as big and as great as he pleas'd: and on the contrary, he could render him&s;elf &s;o little, that he could &s;teal out of &s;ight, and &s;tand on the head of another man, without being felt either by his weight, or perceived by the Eyes of another. Then he could an|nihilate him&s;elf, and place &s;ome other man in his &s;tead: that is to &s;ay, that then he could enjoy the repo&s;e of the <HI>Nireupan.</HI> He &s;uddenly and perfectly under|&s;tood all the things of the World: He equally penetrated things pa&s;t and to come, and having given to his body an entire Agility, he ea&s;ily tran&s;ported him&s;elf from one place to another, to preach Vertue to all Nations.</P>
<P>He had two principal Di&s;ciples, the one on the right Hand, and the other on the left: they were both plac'd behind him, and by each other's &s;ide on the Altars, but their Statues are le&s;s than his. He that is plac'd on his right Hand is called <HI>Pra Mogla,</HI> and he that is on his left Hand is called <HI>Pra Scaribout.</HI> Be|hind the&s;e three Statues, and on the &s;ame Altar, they only repre&s;ent the Officers within the Palace of <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> I know not whether they have Names. Along the Galleries or Cloy&s;ters, which are &s;ometimes round the Temples, are the Statues of the other Officers without the Palace of <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> Of
<PB N="138" REF="81">
<HI>Pra Mogla</HI> they report, that at the reque&s;t of the damned he overturned the Earth, and took the whole Fire of Hell into the hollow of his Hand: but that de&s;igning to extingui&s;h it, he could not effect it, becau&s;e that this Fire dried up the Rivers, in&s;tead of extingui&s;hing, and that it con&s;umed all that whereon <HI>Pra Mogla</HI> placed it: <HI>Pra Mogla</HI> therefore went to be&s;eech <HI>Pra Pouti Tchaou,</HI> or <HI>Som|mona-Codom,</HI> to extingui&s;h Hell Fire: but though <HI>Pra Pouti Tchaou</HI> could do it, he thought it not convenient, becau&s;e, he &s;aid, that men would grow too wicked, if he &s;hould de&s;troy the Fear of this Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>But after that <HI>Pra Pouti Tchaou</HI> was arrived at this high Vertue, he cea&s;ed not to kill a <HI>Mar,</HI> or a <HI>Man</HI> (for they write <HI>Mar</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> though they pronounce always Man) and as a Puni&s;hment for this great fault, his Life exceeded not Eighty years, after which he died, by di&s;appearing on a &s;udden, like a Spark which is lo&s;t in the Air.</P>
<P>The <HI>Man</HI> were a People Enemies to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> whom they called <HI>Paya Man;</HI> and becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e that this People was an Enemy to &s;o holy a Man, they do repre&s;ent them as a mon&s;trous People, with a very large Vi&s;age, with Teeth horrible for their Size, and with Serpents on their Head in&s;tead of Hair.</P>
<P>One day then as <HI>Pra Pouti Tchaou</HI> eat Pig's fle&s;h, he had a Chollick fit which killed him: An admirable end for a man &s;o ab&s;temious: but it was nece&s;&s;ary that he died by a Pig, becau&s;e they &s;uppo&s;e that the Soul of the <HI>Man</HI> whom he &s;lew, was not then in the Body of a <HI>Man,</HI> but in the Body of a Pig: as if a Soul could be e&s;teemed, even according to their Opinion, the Soul of a <HI>Man,</HI> when it is in the Body of a Pig. But all the&s;e inventers of Stories are not &s;o attentive to the Principles of their Doctrine.</P>
<P><HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> before his Death, ordered that &s;ome Statues and Temples &s;hould be Con&s;ecrated to him, and &s;ince his Death he is in that State of repo&s;e, which they expre&s;s by they word <HI>Nireupan.</HI> This is not a place but a kind of Being: for to &s;peak truly, they &s;ay <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> is no where, and he enjoys not any Felicity: he is without power, and out of a condition to do either Good or Evil unto Men: expre&s;&s;ions which the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> have rendered by the word Annihilation. Neverthele&s;s on the other hand the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do e&s;teem <HI>Sommo|na-Codom</HI> happy, they offer up Prayers unto him, and demand of him what|ever they want: whether that their Doctrine agrees not with it &s;elf; or that they extend their wor&s;hip beyond their Doctrine: but in what Sen&s;e &s;oever they attribute Power to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> they agree that he has it only over the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> and that he concerns not him&s;elf with other People, who adore other Men be&s;ides him.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That it is pro|bable that <HI>Sommona-Co|dom</HI> never has been.</NOTE>As therefore they report nothing but Fables of their <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> that they re&s;pect him not as the Author of their Laws and their Doctrine, but at mo&s;t as him who has re-e&s;tabli&s;hed them among&s;t Men, and that in fine they have no rea&s;onable Memory of him, it may be doubted, in my Opinion, that there ever was &s;uch a man. He &s;eems to have been invented to be the Idea of a Man, whom Vertue, as they apprehend it, has rendered happy, in the times of their Fables, that is to &s;ay beyond what their Hi&s;tories contain certain. And becau&s;e that they have thought nece&s;&s;ary to give at the &s;ame time an oppo|&s;ite Idea of a Man, whom his wickedne&s;s has &s;ubjected to great Torments, they have certainly invented that <HI>Thevetat,</HI> whom they &s;uppo&s;e to have been Brother to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> and his Enemy. They make them both to be <HI>Tala|poins,</HI> and when they alledge that <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> has been King, they report it, as they declare he has been an Ape and a Pig.

Add that the word <HI>Pout,</HI> which in <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;ignifies an <HI>Idol,</HI> or <HI>fal&s;e God,</HI> and which doubt|le&s;s &s;ignified <HI>Mercury,</HI> when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> were Idolaters, &s;ignifies <HI>Mercury</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Siame&s;es,</HI> as I have already remark'd. <HI>Mercury,</HI> who was the God of the Sciences, &s;eems to have been adored through the whole Earth; by rea|&s;on doubtle&s;s that Knowledge is one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Attributes of the true God. Remarks which may hereafter excite the curio&s;ity of the learned men, that &s;hall be de&s;igned to travel into the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>But I know not whether to this hour it is not lawful to believe that this is a proof of what I have &s;aid,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It &s;eems to prove that the wor&s;hip of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> is more antient at <HI>Siam</HI> than the Opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is.</HI></NOTE> that the Ance&s;tors of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> mu&s;t have adored the Heaven, like the ancient <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and as perhaps the ancient <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> did, and that having afterwards embraced the Doctrine of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is,</HI> and forgot the true meaning of the name of <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> they have made a man of the Spirit of Heaven, and have attributed unto him all the fables that I have related. 'Tis a great Art to change the belief of the People, to leave unto them their ancient words, by cloathing them with new Idea's. Thus, it may be, that the Ance&s;tors of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have thought that the Spirit of Heaven ruled the whole Nature, though the modern <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do not believe it of <HI>Som|mona-Codom:</HI> they believe on the contrary, as I have &s;aid, that &s;uch a care is op|po&s;ite to the &s;upream felicity. They believe al&s;o that <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> has &s;in|ned, and that he has been puni&s;hed, at the time that he was worthy of the <HI>Nireupan,</HI> becau&s;e they believe the extream virtue impo&s;&s;ible. They believe that the wor&s;hip of <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> is only for them, and that among&s;t the other Nations there are other men, who have render'd them&s;elves worthy of Altars, and which tho&s;e other Nations mu&s;t adore.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Indians</HI> in general are therefore per&s;waded,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What is the Spirit of the Faith of the <HI>Indians,</HI> or the Submi&s;&s;ion which they have to their Traditions.</NOTE> that different people mu&s;t have different Wor&s;hips, but by approving that other People have each their wor&s;hip, they comprehend not that &s;ome would exterminate theirs. They think not like us that Faith is a Virtue: they believe becau&s;e they know not how to doubt; but they per&s;wade not them&s;elves that there is a Faith and Wor&s;hip which ought to be the Faith and the Wor&s;hip of all Nati|ons. Their Prie&s;ts preach not that a Soul &s;hall be puni&s;hed in the other world, for not having believed the Traditions of his Country in this, becau&s;e they un|der&s;tand not that any of them denies the Fables of their Books. They are rea|dy to believe whatever is told rhem of a foreign Religion, how incomprehen|&s;ible &s;oever it be: but they cannot believe that their own is fal&s;e: and much le&s;s can they re&s;olve to change their Laws, their Manners, and their Wor&s;hip. One had better to &s;how them the contrarieties and gro&s;s Ignorance in their Books: they do &s;ometimes agree herein, but for all this they reject not their Books; as for &s;ome fal&s;ity we reject not every Hi&s;torian, nor every Phy&s;ical Book.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXV.</HI> Diver&s;e Ob&s;ervations to be made in preaching the Go&s;pel to the Orientals.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That our Be|lief &s;candalizes the Orientals in &s;everal things; that one mu&s;t not preach to them without cauti|on, if one has not the gift of Miracles.</NOTE>FRom what I have &s;aid concerning the Opinions of the Orientals, it is ea&s;ie to comprehend how difficult an enterprize it is to bring them over to the Chri&s;tian Religion; and of what con&s;equence it is, that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, which preach the Go&s;pel in the Ea&s;t, do perfectly under&s;tand the Manners and Belief of the&s;e People. For as the Apo&s;tles and fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, when God &s;upported their Preaching by &s;o many wonders, did not on a &s;udden di&s;cover to the Hea|thens all the My&s;teries which we adore, but a long time conceal'd from them, and the Catechumens them&s;elves, the knowledge of tho&s;e which might &s;canda|lize them; it &s;eems very rational to me, that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, who have not the gift of Miracles, ought not pre&s;ently to di&s;cover to the Orientals, all the My&s;teries nor all the Practices of Chri&s;tianity. 'Twould be convenient, for example, if I am not mi&s;taken, not to preach unto them, without gteat cauti|on, the wor&s;hipping of Saints: and as to the knowledge of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, I think it would be nece&s;&s;ary to manage it with them, if I may &s;o &s;ay, and not to &s;peak to them of the My&s;terie of the Incarnation, till after having convinced them of the Exi&s;tence of a God Creator.

They would not be le&s;s offended at tho&s;e other my&s;terious words, which our divine Saviour &s;pake to the young Man, who de&s;ired time to go and bury his Parents. Let the dead, &s;aith he, bury the dead. Every one knows the trouble which the <HI>Japponne&s;es</HI> expre&s;&s;ed to St. <HI>Francis Xavier</HI> upon the Eternity of Damnation, not being able to believe that their dead Parents &s;hould fall into &s;o horrible a Misfortune, for want of having embraced Chri&s;tianity, which they had never heard of. It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary therefore to prevent and mollifie this thought, by the means which that great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Indies</HI> u&s;ed, in fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hing the Idea of an omnipotent, all-wi&s;e, and mo&s;t ju&s;t God, the Author of all good, to whom only every thing is due, and by who&s;e will we owe unto Kings, Bi|&s;hops, Magi&s;trates, and to our Parents, the Re&s;pects which we owe them. The&s;e Examples are &s;ufficient to &s;how with what precautions it is nece&s;&s;ary to prepare the minds of the Orientals, to think like us, and not to be offended with mo&s;t of the Articles of the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do not le&s;s re&s;pect their Teachers than their Parents;<NOTE PLACE="marg">'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak to the Orientals with an e&s;teem of their Legi|&s;lators.</NOTE> and this &s;entiment is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t them, that they cha&s;ti&s;e the Tutor to the Prince, the pre&s;umptive Heir of the Crown, for the Faults which that Prince commits; and that there are &s;ome Princes, who being made Kings, have revenged their Tutors. The <HI>Indians</HI> do likewi&s;e greatly honour the Memory of tho&s;e, whom they believe to have preach'd up Virtue efficaciou&s;ly: they are tho&s;e, whom they have judged worthy of their whole Wor&s;hip; and they take Offence that we are &s;candalized thereat. Could we, &s;ay they, do le&s;s for tho&s;e, who have preached unto us &s;o holy a Doctrine? Father <HI>Hierom Xavier,</HI> a <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> Je&s;uit, having publi&s;hed at <HI>Agra</HI> a kind of Catechi&s;m, under the Title of the <HI>Mirrour of Truth:</HI> A <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> named <HI>Zinel Abedin</HI> wrote an an&s;wer thereunto, under the Title of the <HI>Mirrour repuls'd,</HI> which the Congregation <HI>de Propaganda fide</HI> thought nece&s;&s;ary to have confuted: and it committed the care thereof to Father <HI>Philip Guadagnol,</HI> of the Order of the Regular Minimes. But he &s;pake &s;o unworthily of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> that his confutation proved ineffectu|al; becau&s;e that the Mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> dar'd never to publi&s;h it: and this Mi&s;|&s;ion de&s;iring Father <HI>Guadagnol</HI> &s;omewhat to moderate his Satyr, this good Father running into the other extream, made a Panegyrick upon <HI>Mahomet,</HI> which drew upon him a Reprimand from the Congregation <HI>de propaganda.</HI> 'Tis therefore ne|ce&s;&s;ary in the&s;e &s;orts of matters to ob&s;erve a wi&s;e Moderation, and to &s;peak re&s;pectfully, at lea&s;t to the <HI>Indians,</HI> of <HI>Brama, Sommona-Codom,</HI> and all the re&s;t, who&s;e Statues are &s;een on their Altars. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary to agree with them that the&s;e men have had great natural lights, and intentions worthy of Prai&s;e; and at the &s;ame time to in&s;inuate to them, that being men, they are deceived in &s;e|veral things important to the eternal Salvation of Mankind, and principally in that they have not known the Creator.</P>
<P>But next to this Blindne&s;s, which it is nece&s;&s;ary to demon&s;trate inexcu&s;able,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That the&s;e Law-givers may be prai&s;ed in &s;ome things.</NOTE>
why &s;hould we not prai&s;e the Legi&s;lators of the Ea&s;t, as well as the <HI>Greek</HI> Legi|&s;lators, for that they have applied them&s;elves to in&s;pire into the People, what to them has appeared mo&s;t virtuous, and mo&s;t proper to keep them in Peace and Innocence? Why &s;hould we blame them for the Fables, which a long &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of Ages full of Ignorance has invented upon their account, and of which
<PB N="142" REF="83">
probably they have not been the Authors: con&s;idering that when they had &s;poken magnificently of their per&s;ons, they had only done what is pardonable in almo&s;t all other Legi&s;lators? They have the merit of haveing known before the <HI>Greeks</HI> &s;ome intelligent Beings &s;uperior to man, and the Immortality of the Soul.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">That the Doctrine of <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> may be ex|cu&s;ed by Phy|&s;ical Rea&s;ons.</NOTE>But if they have believed the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is,</HI> they have been thereto induced by apparent Rea&s;ons. Ignoring all Creation, and e&s;tabli&s;hing moreover that a Soul cannot proceed from a Soul, and that there could not be an infinite number of Souls; they were forced to conclude that the infinite number of the living, which had &s;ucceeded one another in the World, during all this pa&s;t Eternity, which they &s;uppo&s;ed that the World had already la&s;ted; could not be anima|ted by this finite number of Spirits, unle&s;s they had pa&s;&s;ed an infinite number of times from one body to another. The Opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> is there|fore founded on &s;everal Principles which we receive; and certainly contains on|ly one Fal&s;ity, which is the pretended Impo&s;&s;ibility of the Creation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">And by Poli|tick Rea&s;ons.</NOTE>As to the natural con&s;equences of this Doctrine, the Prohibition of Meats is very whol&s;om in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Horror of Blood would be every where u&s;eful. The great <HI>Barcalon,</HI> elder Brother to the fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Siam,</HI> cea|&s;ed not to reproach the Chri&s;tians for the bloody Madne&s;s of our Wars. On the other hand, the Opinion of the <HI>Metemp&s;ycho&s;is</HI> comforts men in the Misfor|tunes of Life, and fortifies them again&s;t the Horrors of Death, by the Hopes which it gives of reviving another time more happily: and becau&s;e that men are credulous in proportion to their de&s;ires, 'tis ob&s;erved that tho&s;e, who e&s;teem them&s;elves the mo&s;t unhappy People in this Life, as Eunuchs, do &s;trongly ad|here to this hope of another better Life, which the Doctrine of the <HI>Metemp&s;y|cho&s;is</HI> has given to good men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The fear of the dead Parents excu&s;ed by Po|litick Rea&s;ons.</NOTE>But if Error can be advantageous, what other can be &s;o much as that Fear of Children for their dead Parents. <HI>Confucius</HI> makes it the only Foundation of all good Policy. And indeed it e&s;tabli&s;hes the Peace of Families, and of King|doms: it bends men to Obedience, and renders them more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their Parents and to their Magi&s;trates; it pre&s;erves good Manners and the Laws. The&s;e People comprehend not that they can ever abandon the Opinions and Cu&s;toms, which they have received from their Fathers, nor avoid, if they did, the Re&s;entment which, in their Opinion, their Ance&s;tors would expre&s;s thereat. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Doctrine has no other Paradice, nor Hell, than this Republic of the dead, where they believe that the Soul is received at the departure out of this Life, and where it is well or ill entertained with the Souls of its Ance&s;tors, according to its Vertues or its Vices.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">This fear cau|&s;es the &s;tabili|ty of the Laws of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE>'Tis upon this con&s;ideration, that the Lawful Kings of <HI>China</HI> have ab&s;tained from making any Innovations on the Government. None but U&s;urpers dare to do this, not only by the Right which force gives them, but becau&s;e that not being de&s;cended from the Kings their Predece&s;&s;ors, they have not thought any re&s;pect due to their E&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet it has its Inconvenien|ces.</NOTE>Neverthele&s;s as all errors have bad &s;ides, <HI>Confucius</HI> being ask'd by one of his Di&s;ciples, whether the dead had any &s;en&s;e of the Re&s;pects which their Children paid them, an&s;wer'd, That it was not fitting to make the&s;e over-curious &s;orts of Que&s;tions; that by an&s;wering negatively, he fear'd to aboli&s;h the re&s;pect of Children for their dead Parents;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The <HI>Talapoins</HI> mu&s;t not be thought know|ing and Inte|re&s;ted Impo&s;t|ors.</P>
<P>That it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary with the Orientals to u&s;e all the in&s;inuations which our Re|ligion and the example of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians can permit us.</P></NOTE> and by an&s;wering affirmatively, he dreaded the exciting the be&s;t Per&s;ons to kill them&s;elves, to go and joyn their Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>'Twould al&s;o be, I know not what Inju&s;tice to treat the <HI>Talapoins</HI> as Impo&s;tors, and intere&s;&s;ed Per&s;ons. They deceive only becau&s;e they are fir&s;t deceived: they are not more cunning, nor more intete&s;ted than the Seculars. When they preach to the Seculars to be&s;tow Alms upon them, they think their Preaching their Duty; and in every Country the Mini&s;ters of the Altar do live on the Altar.</P>
<P>I am therefore convinced, that the true &s;ecret of in&s;inuating into the mind of the&s;e People, &s;uppo&s;ing one has not the Gift of Miracles, is not directly to con|tradict them in any thing, but to &s;how them, as at unawares, their Errors in the Sciences, and e&s;pecially in the Mathematicks and Anatomy, wherein they are
<PB N="143" REF="83">
mo&s;t palpable: 'Tis to change the Terms of their Wor&s;hip the lea&s;t Imaginable, by giving to the true God, either the Name of Soveraign Lord, or that of King of Heaven and Earth, or &s;ome other Name which &s;ignifies in the Lan|guage of the Country, what is mo&s;t worthy of Veneration, as the word <HI>Pra</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e:</HI> But at the &s;ame time it be nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;truct them to annex unto the&s;e Names the intire Idea of the Deity, an Idea &s;o much the more ea&s;ie to receive, as it only heightens and embelli&s;hes the mean Idea's of the fal&s;e Gods. <HI>Gott</HI> which now &s;ignifies <HI>God</HI> in <HI>German,</HI> was anciently, according to <HI>Vo&s;&s;ius,</HI> the Name of <HI>Mercury,</HI> who &s;eems to have been every where adored. Certainly the words <HI>Theos</HI> and <HI>Deus</HI> have not always &s;ignified in <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> the God, which we adore. What then have the Chri&s;tians done? They have accepted the&s;e Names in the &s;tead of the ineffable Name of God, and they have explain|ed them after their manner. From the Knowledge of an eternal, &s;piritual God and Creator, it would be ea&s;ie to de&s;cend to the Faith of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: and the&s;e People would make no Oppo&s;ition, if fir&s;t they &s;aw them&s;elves cured of &s;ome &s;en&s;ible Ignorance. The Spirit of man is &s;uch, that he almo&s;t implicitly receives the Opinions of him, who has vi&s;ibly convinc'd him of his fir&s;t Errors. Thoroughly convince a &s;ick per&s;on that the Remedy which he u&s;es is not good, and he will immediately take yours.</P>
<P>But in my opinion it is one of the mo&s;t important Articles of the conduct of the Mi&s;&s;ionaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How the Mi&s;|&s;ionaries ought to accommo|date them|&s;elves to the &s;imple cu&s;toms of the Orien|tals, in what concerns not Religion.</NOTE> to accommodate them&s;elves entirely to the &s;implicity of the Manners of the Orientals, in their Food, Furniture, Lodging, and whatever the Rules of the <HI>Talapoins</HI> pre&s;cribe, wherein they have nothing contrary to Chri&s;tianity. The example of Father <HI>de Nobilibus</HI> the Je&s;uit is famous. Being in Mi&s;&s;ion to the Kingdom of <HI>Madura</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> he re&s;olved to live like a <HI>Jogue,</HI> that is to &s;ay, like a <HI>Bramin</HI> of the Woods; to go with his Feet naked, and his Headbare, and his Body almo&s;t naked, in the &s;corching Sands of this Country, and to nouri&s;h him&s;elf with that exce&s;s of frugality, which appear'd intollerable: and it is reported that by this means he converted near forty thou&s;and per&s;ons. Now as this exact imitation of the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;everity is the true way to make &s;ome Conver&s;ions, &s;o the further one &s;hould remove therefrom, the more one &s;hould attract the hatred and contempt of the <HI>Indians.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary to learn in the&s;e Countries, to make a &s;hift with whatever they do, and not to &s;u&s;tain the ne|ce&s;&s;ities, or rather the &s;uperfluities of the&s;e Countries, if one would not cau&s;e Jealou&s;ie and Envy to &s;ome Nations, the particular per&s;ons of which conceal their fortune, becau&s;e they can pre&s;erve it only by hiding. The le&s;s the Mi&s;&s;i|onaries appear &s;ettled, the more the Mi&s;&s;ion is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the better it pro|motes Religion. As the Ea&s;t is not a Country of &s;ettlement for private per|&s;ons, it would be an injury to think to accompli&s;h it: the Natives of the Coun|try do not them&s;elves enjoy any &s;olid fortune; and they would not fail to pick quarrels with tho&s;e that &s;hould appear richer than them, to deprive them of their Riches. Moreover, the Orientals &s;eem to have no prejudice for any Reli|gion; and it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that if the beauty of Chri&s;tianity has not con|vinc'd them, it is principally by rea&s;on of the bad opinion, which the Avarice, Treachery, Inva&s;ions, and Tyranny of the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> and &s;ome Chri&s;tians in the <HI>Indies,</HI> have implanted and rivetted in them. But it is time to conclude this Relation with the Life of <HI>Thevetat,</HI> the Brother of <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> and with all the other things that I have promi&s;ed.</P>

<P>AFter the birth of <HI>Pouti Sat</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This is one of the names of <HI>Sommona-Co|dom: Sat,</HI> in my Opinion &s;ignifies Lord in <HI>Baly,</HI> as <HI>Tchaou</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> and &s;o he is called <HI>Pouti Sat,</HI> and <HI>Pouti Tchaou;</HI> the word <HI>Pou|ti</HI> is <HI>Baly.</HI></NOTE>, who by his good works in proce&s;s of time arrived at the <HI>Nireupan,</HI> his Father, King <HI>Taou&s;outout,</HI> con&s;ult|ed the Sooth&s;ayers to know what would betide him, and the for|tune that a Son would have, at who&s;e Nativity there had appeared &s;o many Wonders. They all a&s;&s;ur'd him that he had great rea&s;on to rejoyce, &s;eeing that if his Son did continue in the World, he would be Emperor of the whole Earth; or that if he turned <HI>Talapoin,</HI> by abandoning the Plea&s;ures of the Age, he would arrive at the <HI>Nireupan.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary to know that this Empe|ror had &s;even &s;orts of things, which were &s;o peculiar to him, that there was none be&s;ides him that had them. The fir&s;t was a Gla&s;s-bowl, which he made u&s;e of to rid him&s;elf of his Enemies, by throwing it again&s;t tho&s;e whom he would kill; which being let go, went to cut off the Enemies head, and then return'd of it &s;elf. The &s;econd were Elephants and Hor&s;es of an extraordinary goodne&s;s and beauty, which did fly with the &s;ame facility as they walked. The third was a piece of Gla&s;s, by the means of which he could have as much Gold and Silver as he plea&s;ed: for to this end he needed only to throw it into the Air, and of the heighth that it went, there would grow a Pillar of Gold or Silver. The fourth was a Lady, come from the North, of a marvellous Beauty, who had a great gla&s;s Pot &s;u&s;tained by three Columns of the &s;ame: then when &s;he would boil any Rice, &s;he needed only to put never &s;o little Rice therein, and the Fire would kindle of it &s;elf, and extingui&s;hed al&s;o of it &s;elf when the Rice was boiled: the Rice multiplied &s;o exceedingly in the boiling, that it would feed five hundred men and more. The fifth was a man, who took care of the Hou&s;e, and who had Eyes &s;o penetrating, that he did &s;ee Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones in the Bowels of the Earth. The &s;ixth was a great <HI>Mandarin</HI> of an ex|traordinary Strength and Valour. The la&s;t was, that he had a Thou&s;and Children by one Queen, which indeed did not all come out of her Womb. One alone came out thence, and the re&s;t were engendered of the Water, Blood, and whatever comes out at the Delivery. Every one of the&s;e Children in par|ticular being grown up, was capable of &s;ubduing and vanqui&s;hing all the Ene|mies, which their Father could have. Now there was one of the Sooth&s;ayers, who taking the Father a&s;ide, told him, that a&s;&s;uredly his Son would abandon the World, would quit the Kingdom, and would con&s;ecrate him&s;elf to Repen|tance by turning <HI>Talapoin,</HI> to be able by his good works to arrive at the <HI>Ni|reupan.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="87">His Relations, to the Number of Ten Thou&s;and, under&s;tanding by the An|&s;wer of the Sooth&s;ayer, that the Univer&s;al Deme&s;ne of this whole World, or the <HI>Nireupan</HI> were a&s;certained to this young Prince, re&s;olv'd among&s;t them&s;elves every one to give him, when he &s;hould be a little advanced in years, one of their Sons to make up his Train; and &s;o they did. When therefore this Prince, after the Repentance of &s;ome &s;even years, which he performed in the Woods, was become worthy of the <HI>Nireupan,</HI> a great many of the&s;e young men, whom we mentioned, which were of his Retinue, turn'd <HI>Talapoins</HI> with him; but among&s;t this great Company there were &s;ix, who though they were his Relations, and in his Train, would not yet follow him. We will recite the Names thereof, by rea&s;on that in the &s;equel we &s;hall &s;peak only of them. The fir&s;t is called <HI>Pattia,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Anourout,</HI> the third <HI>Aanon,</HI> the fourth <HI>Packou,</HI> the fifth <HI>Qua|mila,</HI> the &s;ixth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>Siame|&s;es</HI> report that <HI>Thevetat</HI> was the Brother of <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> by this Hi&s;tory he on|ly is his Rela|tion.</NOTE> <HI>Thevetat:</HI> and it is of this la&s;t that we wrire the Hi&s;tory.

Hereupon therefore the Father of <HI>Anourout,</HI> one of the&s;e &s;ix young Princes, who was the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Taou&s;outout,</HI> &s;aid to his Son, that though he was of Royal Blood, yet if <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> would receive him into his Com|pany as a <HI>Talapoin,</HI> he would not hinder him, though &s;ome Per&s;ons of his Qua|lity would not follow this Example.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Anourout</HI> being accu&s;tomed to his Plea&s;ures, and to have whatever he de&s;ired, under&s;tood not what this word of refu&s;al, <HI>No,</HI> did mean. One day as the&s;e &s;ix young Princes diverted them&s;elves at Bowls, and played for Confects for a Collation, <HI>Anourout</HI> having lo&s;t, &s;ent a Man to his Mother, to intreat her to &s;end him &s;ome Confects, which &s;he did: having eaten them, they played for a &s;econd Collation, then a third and a fourth; and his Mother &s;ent him &s;ome Confects, till all were gone: But as <HI>Anourout</HI> &s;till &s;ent to have more, his Mother then told the Servant: <HI>No, there are no more.</HI> Which being related to the Son, and the Son not under&s;tanding what the&s;e words, <HI>No there are no more,</HI> did &s;ignify, having never heard them &s;poken, thought that his Mo|ther meant that &s;he had yet others more excellent, the name of which mu&s;t be the&s;e words, <HI>No there are no more.</HI> He therefore &s;ent back his Servant to his Mo|ther, de&s;iring her to &s;end him &s;ome of the Confects <HI>No there are no more;</HI> his Mother perceiving hereby that her Son under&s;tood not the&s;e words, <HI>No there are no more,</HI> re&s;olved to explain them to him. She took a great empty Di&s;h, covered it with another, and gave it to the Servant to carry to her Son. But then the <HI>Genij</HI> of the City <HI>Koubilepat</HI> reflecting on all that had pa&s;&s;ed between Prince <HI>Anourout</HI> and his Mother, and knowing that the Prince under&s;tood not the&s;e words, <HI>No there are no more,</HI> (becau&s;e that formerly in another Generation he had Charitably given to the <HI>Talapoins</HI> his Portion of Rice, and had demand|ed and de&s;ired, that in proce&s;s of time, when he &s;hould come to revive again in this World, he might not under&s;tand what the&s;e words, <HI>No there are no more,</HI> did mean; neither did he under&s;tand or know the place where the Rice did grow) they &s;aid that it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;peedily to a&s;&s;emble them&s;elves with the other <HI>Genij,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The&s;e <HI>Genij</HI> are not invul|nerable, and their care is to recompence and puni&s;h.</NOTE> to con&s;ult what was proper to be done, becau&s;e that if <HI>Anourout</HI> found the Plate empty, their head as a Puni&s;hment would be broke in &s;even pieces. It was therefore re&s;olved that they would fill it with Confects brought from Heaven, which they did. The Servant who carried the Plate, having laid it at the place, where the&s;e young Princes were diverting them&s;elves, <HI>Anourout,</HI> who only expected this to pay his Debt to his Companions, ran to the Plate and uncovered it, and found it as before, full of Confects, but &s;o ex|cellent that the whole City was perfumed with their Odor: The excellent ta&s;te which they found in the&s;e Confects, diffu&s;ed it &s;elf through their whole Body. The Plate was &s;oon empty, and hereupon <HI>Anourout</HI> reflecting on the goodne&s;s of the&s;e Confects &s;aid unto him&s;elf: It mu&s;t needs be that my Mother has &s;carcely loved me till now, &s;eeing that &s;he never gave me the Confects, <HI>No there are no
<PB N="147" REF="87">
more.</HI> Returning home, he went to ask his Mother, whether &s;he loved her Son. His Mother, who pa&s;&s;ionately loved him, was exceedingly &s;urprized at this que&s;ti|on, and an&s;wered him that &s;he loved him as her own Heart, and Eyes. And why, if what you &s;ay is true, have you never given me the Confects, <HI>No there are no more.</HI> For the future I be&s;eech you to give me no other: I am re&s;olved to eat only of the&s;e. His Mother, a&s;toni&s;hed to hear her Son &s;peak thus, addre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf to the Servant, who had carried the Plate, and asked him &s;ecretly, whether he &s;aw any thing therein, to whom he an&s;wered yes, that he &s;aw the Di&s;h filled with a kind of Confects, which he had never &s;een before: and then the Mother of <HI>Anourout</HI> comprehended the My&s;tery, and judged right|ly that the Antient Merit of her Son had procured him the&s;e Confects, and that the Superior <HI>Genij</HI> had rendered him this good Office. Afterwards therefore when the Prince demanded the&s;e Confects of his Mother, &s;he only took an empty Di&s;h, covered it with another, and &s;ent it him, and the Plate was al|ways found full as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Anourout</HI> under&s;tood not likewi&s;e the meaning of the&s;e words, to a&s;&s;ume the <HI>Pagne</HI> or <HI>Talapoins</HI> Habit, and having one day de&s;ired his elder Brother <HI>Pattia</HI> to explain them to him, <HI>Pattia</HI> informed him what he knew, that to a&s;&s;ume the <HI>Tala|poins</HI> Habit, was intirely to &s;have his Hair and Beard, to &s;leep on a Hurdle, and to cloath him&s;elf with a yellow <HI>Pagne.</HI> Which <HI>Anourout</HI> under&s;tanding, he told his Brother that being accu&s;tomed to live at his ea&s;e, and to have all things at plea&s;ure, he &s;hould find much difficulty to lead this Life: And <HI>Pattia</HI> replyed, &s;eeing then my Brother that you will not re&s;olve to turn <HI>Talapoin,</HI> con&s;ider which is be&s;t: but al&s;o not to live Idly, learn to work and continue at my Father's Hou&s;e as long as you plea&s;e. <HI>Anourout</HI> asked him what he meant by this word to <HI>Work,</HI> which he under&s;tood not: <HI>Pattia</HI> then &s;aid unto him, how can you know what it is to work, &s;eeing that you neither know where nor how the Rice grows? One day indeed <HI>Quimila, Pattia,</HI> and <HI>Anourout</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing toge|ther upon the Place where the Rice might grow, <HI>Quimila</HI> replyed that it grow|ed in the Barn: <HI>Pattia,</HI> &s;aid no, and a&s;&s;erted that it grew in the Pot: And <HI>Anou|rout</HI> told them both that they under&s;tood nothing, and that it grew in the Di&s;h. The fir&s;t having one day ob&s;erved that the Rice was taken out of the Barn, thought it was there that it grew. The &s;econd had &s;een it taken out of the Pot, and 'tis that which gave him occa&s;ion to think that it grew in the Pot: But the third who had never &s;een it otherwi&s;e than in the Di&s;h, really believed that the Rice grew in the Di&s;h, when one had a de&s;ire to eat: and thus all three knew nothing of the matter.</P>
<P><HI>Anourout</HI> declared afterwards to the other two that he was not inclined to work, and that he cho&s;e rather to turn <HI>Talapoin:</HI> and he went to ask leave of his Mother. She refu&s;ed him two or three times: but as he would not be de|nied, and as he continually pre&s;&s;ed her more and more, &s;he told him that if <HI>Pattia</HI> would turn <HI>Talapoin,</HI> &s;he would permit him to follow him. <HI>Anourout</HI> went therefore to &s;ollicit his five other Companions to make them&s;elves <HI>Talapoins,</HI> and they re&s;olved to do it &s;even days after. The&s;e &s;even days being elap&s;ed they went out of the City, with a great Equipage, &s;eeming to go to divert them|&s;elves in the Country. In their retinue they had a great many <HI>Mandarins</HI> mount|ed on Elephants, with a good number of Footmen. But principally they had in their Train a Barber by Profe&s;&s;ion, named <HI>Oubbali.</HI> Being atrived at the Confines of the Kingdom, they &s;ent back all their retinue except <HI>Oubbali:</HI> then they &s;tript them&s;elves of their Cloaths, folded them up very neatly, and put them into the hands of <HI>Oubbali,</HI> to make him a pre&s;ent thereof, telling him that he &s;hould return into the City, and that he had wherewithal to live at his ea&s;e the remainder of his days. <HI>Oubbali,</HI> very much afflicted to &s;eparate him&s;elf from the&s;e &s;ix Princes, and yet not daring to contradict what they order'd him, after having taken his leave of them departed weeping, and took his road to|wards the Ciry, from whence they had &s;et out together. But it pre&s;ently came into his mind, that if he returned, and that the Parents of the&s;e young Princes &s;hould &s;ee the cloaths of their Children, they would have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect him of their death, and likewi&s;e to put him to death, not believing that the&s;e young
<PB N="148" REF="88">
Princes would have quitted &s;uch precious Habits to give them to him. Here|upon he hung up the&s;e Habits on a Tree, and returned to &s;eek out the&s;e young Lords. So &s;oon as they &s;aw him, they demanded the rea&s;on of his return, and having declared it to them, he te&s;tified that he would continue with them, and a&s;&s;ume the Habit of a <HI>Talapoin.</HI> The&s;e young Princes pre&s;ented him then to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> be&s;eeching him to give the Habit to him, rather than to them: for finding them&s;elves yet full of the Spirit of the World, and proud of heart, and willing to humble them&s;elves, they de&s;ired that <HI>Oubbali,</HI> who was very in|ferior to them in the World, might be their Elder in Religion, to the end they might be obliged to re&s;pect him, and to yield to him in all things: the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I &s;uppo&s;e that this is a remark which the Tran&s;lator has in&s;erted in|to the Text, and we may therein re|mark &s;ome other.</NOTE> Rule, requiring that between two <HI>Talapoins</HI> the Elde&s;t have all the Honours, though the younge&s;t be much the more Learned. <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> granted them their Reque&s;t, and they a&s;&s;umed the Habit a little while after <HI>Oubbali.</HI> Being therefore entred into the time of Repentance, <HI>Pattia</HI> by his merit had a Cae|le&s;tial Heart, Eyes, and Ears; that is to &s;ay he under&s;tood every thing, he knew the Hearts of others, he &s;aw all things, and heard every thing, notwith|&s;tanding the di&s;tance and all ob&s;tacles. One day after <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> had preached, <HI>Anourout</HI> was advanced to the degree of an Angel. At the &s;ame time <HI>Aanon</HI> a <HI>Talapoin,</HI> dear to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> went to <HI>Sonda</HI> the fir&s;t degree of Perfection. <HI>Packou</HI> and <HI>Quimila</HI> after having a long time exerci&s;ed them&s;elves in Prayer and Meditation, were advanced to be Angels. There was <HI>Thevetat</HI> alone that could obtain no other thing than a great &s;trength, and the power of doing Miracles<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Mira|cles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t per|&s;wade them that he is <HI>The|vetat:</HI> but it is nece&s;&s;ary to e|vince to them that the Mira|cles which they attribute to <HI>Thevetat</HI> are to do Evil, and that tho&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are for Good.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Sommona Codom</HI> being gone with his <HI>Talapoins</HI> to the City of <HI>Kou&s;ampi,</HI> the In|habitants came daily to make them pre&s;ents, &s;ometimes to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> &s;ometimes to <HI>Mogla</HI> and to <HI>Saribout,</HI> his two principal Favourites, one of which &s;at on his Right hand, and the other on his Left: &s;ome to <HI>Ka&s;op</HI> and <HI>Pattia,</HI> others to <HI>Quimila</HI> and <HI>Packon,</HI> or to <HI>Anourout;</HI> but what is remarkable, no bo|dy pre&s;ented to <HI>Thevetat:</HI> and they &s;pake no more of him than if he had never been in the world, whereat he was extreamly inraged. Is it, &s;aid he, that I am not a <HI>Talapoin</HI> as well as the others? Is it that I am not of the Royal Blood like them? Why has no one made any Pre&s;ent to me? He therefore re&s;olved in&s;tantly to &s;eek out &s;ome body that &s;hould pre&s;ent him, and to allure &s;ome Di&s;ciples. The King of the City <HI>Pimpi&s;aan,</HI> was arrived to the fir&s;t degree of Perfection, with One Hundred and Ten Thou&s;and men, all Di&s;ciples of <HI>Som|mona-Codom:</HI> and he had a Son as yet young, and who knew not what Evil was, <HI>Thevetat</HI> contriving to &s;educe this Son, to make u&s;e of him in his wicked de&s;igns, went from the City of <HI>Pinme&s;an,</HI> to go to <HI>Rhacacreu,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed by the power he had, the &s;hape of a little Infant, with a Serpent round each Leg, another round his Neck, and another round his Head. Be&s;ides this he had one, who embracing him on the left Shoulder, de&s;cended underneath the right Shoul|der before and behind. In this equipage he took wing, and went through the Air to the City of <HI>Rachacreu.</HI> He lights at the Feet of <HI>Achata&s;atrou,</HI> who was that young Prince the Son of the King of the City of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Ju&s;t before he &s;aid <HI>Pimpi|&s;aan.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pimmepi&s;an,</HI> and who &s;eeing <HI>Thevetat</HI> after this manner, with his whole body twi&s;ted about with Ser|pents, conceived a great Terror thereat. Being affrighted at a thing &s;o &s;trange, he asked <HI>Thevetat</HI> who he was, and <HI>Thevetat</HI> having told him his Name, and entirely confirmed him, re-a&s;&s;umed his fir&s;t &s;hape, that is to &s;ay his <HI>Talapoins</HI> Habit, and his Serpents di&s;appeared. <HI>Achata&s;atrou</HI> hereupon conceived a great e&s;teem of <HI>Thevetat,</HI> and made him great Pre&s;ents, an Honor which effected the ruine of <HI>Thevetat</HI> by the Pride he conceived thereat; for from that time he contrived the de&s;ign of making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter and Chief of his Brethren. He went therefore to <HI>Sommona-Codom;</HI> he found him out who preached to the King, &s;aluted him, approached him, and after &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e told him, that being al|ready in a very advanced Age, it was not fit that for the future he &s;hould take &s;o much Pains, but that he ought to think of &s;pending the re&s;t of his days plea|&s;antly and at his own Ea&s;e. I am, added he, ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t you to the utmo&s;t of my power, and as the care of &s;o many Religious overwhelms you, you may for the future di&s;charge it upon me. This is the Language, which the extream
<PB N="153" REF="88">
de&s;ire of &s;eeing him&s;elf above all, did put into his Mouth. <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> who knew him, refus'd and contemn'd his demand, whereat <HI>Thevetat</HI> was &s;o enraged, that he only plotted ways to revenge him&s;elf. He returned to the Ci|ty of <HI>Rachacreu</HI> to find out <HI>Achata&s;atrou</HI> his Di&s;ciple, and per&s;waded him to get rid of his Father, the &s;ooner to get upon the Throne, and afterwards to afford him the means of putting <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> to Death, and of &s;etting up him&s;elf in his &s;tead. <HI>Achata&s;atrou</HI> then cau&s;ed his Father to be put into a Dungeon loaded with Irons, and &s;eized on the Throne: <HI>Thevetat</HI> expre&s;&s;ed unto him his Joy, and de&s;ired him to remember the Promi&s;e he had made him. The new King pre|&s;ently granted him 500 men armed with Arrows, to go and kill <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> They found him walking at the Foot of a Mountain; and his &s;ight alone im|pre&s;&s;ed in them &s;o much Fear and Re&s;pect, that there was not any one who dared to let fly an Arrow; they all remained immoveable, every one with their Bow bent. <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> intreated them to tell him the Author of their En|terprize; and when they had informed him, he preached a Sermon unto them, at the end of which they arrived at the fir&s;t degree of Perfection, and returned home. So &s;oon as <HI>Thevetat</HI> &s;aw that they had mi&s;&s;ed their blow, he went him|&s;elf on the Mountain, and applied him&s;elf to roul down Stones to the bottom, de&s;ignedly to kill <HI>Sommona-Codom:</HI> and when he thought he had thrown down enough to kill him, he de&s;cended thence, and called him two or three times by his Name; <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> who had a&s;cended the Mountain at one &s;ide, when <HI>Thevetat</HI> de&s;cended at the other, an&s;wered that he was at top: <HI>Thevetat</HI> pre&s;ent|ly re-mounted, and at the &s;ame time <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> who knew him without &s;eeing him, de&s;cended without being &s;een. <HI>Thevetat</HI> re-a&s;cended again in vain, and he died with rage. Mean while <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf thus per&s;e|cuted, &s;aid unto him&s;elf, what Crime, what Sin have I committed? Now that I am at the heighth of perfection, that I have performed &s;o great a Penitence that I have preached &s;o much and taught &s;o holy a doctrine, yet they cea&s;e not to per&s;ecute me to kill me. And by thus examining him&s;elf he remember'd, that one day being drunk,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sommona-Co|dom</HI> &s;ins and is puni&s;hed in Hell.</NOTE> *he had hit a <HI>Talapoin</HI> with a little &s;tone which he had flung, and which had drawn out a little blood, and he knew that he was to be puni&s;hed in five hundred Generations &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; that he had already been puni&s;hed in 499, and that this was the five hundredth: be&s;ides which, he had been a long time in Hell. Wherefore knowing moreover that if he permitted not <HI>Thevetat</HI> to do him &s;ome mi&s;chief, he &s;hould kill him with rage, and go into Hell after his death, he rather cho&s;e that a &s;mall &s;hiver of a Flint which <HI>Thevetat</HI> threw at him, and which da&s;h'd in pieces again&s;t another, &s;hould wound him in the foot to draw out a little blood. 'Twas he that &s;tretch'd out his foot to re|ceive the blow, and thereby he appea&s;ed the anger of <HI>Thevetat,</HI> who for &s;ome time forgot the Re&s;olution of killing him.</P>
<P>One day as <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> went to beg Alms in the City of <HI>Rachacreu, Theve|tat</HI> being adverti&s;ed thereof, procur'd the King to &s;end his mo&s;t mi&s;chievous Elephants to do him a mi&s;chief, if he did not retreat. <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> cea&s;ed not to continue his road with his <HI>Talapoins:</HI> and as they came near the Elephants, <HI>Aanon</HI> went before his Ma&s;ter, to &s;ecure him from the fury of the Elephants, by expo&s;ing him&s;elf, but they hurt no body.</P>
<P>At his departure out of the City, <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> retir'd into a <HI>Pagod,</HI> where the people brought him to eat. He eat, and preached afterwards to all this multitude, which was come out to the number of Ten Millions of per&s;ons, to hear him: and he converted four&s;core and four Thou&s;and, &s;ome of which went to the fir&s;t degree, others to the &s;econd, others to the third, others to the fourth degree of Perfection. Several enlarged them&s;elves on the Prai&s;es of <HI>Aanon,</HI> who loved his ma&s;ter &s;o dearly, as to expo&s;e his life for him. Whereupon <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> informed them, that this was not the fir&s;t time <HI>Aanon</HI> had done it. Another time he &s;aid unto them, when I was King of the <HI>Ong</HI> ('tis a kind of Bird) <HI>Aanon</HI> being al&s;o an <HI>Ong,</HI> and my younger Brother, he &s;aved my life by expo&s;ing his in my place. When the King <HI>Achata&s;atrou</HI> had heard <HI>Aanon</HI> thus commended, for having expo&s;ed his life for his Ma&s;ter, he recalled the 500 men, which he had given to <HI>Thevetat:</HI> and thus <HI>Thevetat</HI> &s;aw him&s;elf abandon'd
<PB N="154" REF="89">
by every one. He had leave to beg, but no body gave him wherewith to live: being reduced to the extremity of &s;eeking a livelihood him&s;elf, he return|ed to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> and offered him five Propo&s;itions, which he intreated him to grant. The fir&s;t was, that if there were &s;ome <HI>Talapoins</HI> who would oblige them&s;elves to live in the Woods, and &s;eque&s;ter'd from the World, he would permit them. The &s;econd, that tho&s;e who would engage them&s;elves to live only on Alms, might &s;ubmit them&s;elves thereto. The third, that he would grant the liberty of cloathing them&s;elves poorly to &s;uch who would de&s;ire al|ways to do it, and who would oblige them&s;elves to be always contented with old <HI>Pagnes,</HI> patched and na&s;ty. The fourth, that he would permit tho&s;e which &s;hould de&s;ire it, to refu&s;e all their life to have any other Convent or Lodging, than under a Tree; and in fine, that they who would never eat Meat or Fi&s;h, might deprive them&s;elves thereof. <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> an&s;wer'd him, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to leave to every one his own will, and to oblige no per&s;on to more than he would, or even than he could. <HI>Thevetat</HI> ro&s;e up after <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI>'s An&s;wer, and cried aloud to all the <HI>Talapoins</HI> that were pre&s;ent; let all tho&s;e that would be happy follow me: and immediately a Troop of ignorant per&s;ons, to the number of five hundred, deceived by the &s;pecious appearance of his fal&s;e intentions, re&s;olved to follow him, and exactly to keep the five things which he propo&s;ed. They had &s;ome devoto's which nouri&s;h'd them, and which &s;up|ply'd all their wants: although they knew that <HI>Thevetat</HI> had kindled the War among&s;t the <HI>Talopoins,</HI> by &s;eparating him&s;elf from his Ma&s;ter. When <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> &s;aw that he took &s;o wicked a Conduct, he endeavoured to reclaim him, by divers Sermons which he made to him, to convince him that there was not a greater Crime than this. <HI>Thevetat</HI> heard him very patiently, but without making any benefit thereby: for he briskly quitted <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> On the Road he met <HI>Aanon,</HI> who demanded Charity from door to door in the City of <HI>Rachacreu,</HI> and told him that he had ju&s;t quitted his Ma&s;ter, to live for the future after his own humor. <HI>Aanon</HI> told it to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> who repli'd, that he knew it very well, that he &s;aw that <HI>Thevetat</HI> was an unhappy wretch, that he would go into Hell. This, adds he, is exactly as Sinners do; they commit great Crimes, and this they call doing Good, and what is Good they call Evil. Virtuous Men do good without trouble, whereas it is a puni&s;hment to the wicked; and on the contrary, Evil di&s;plea&s;eth the Good, and the wicked make a plea&s;ure thereof. Knowing therefore the place and quarter where <HI>Thevetat</HI> was retir'd with his 500 Di&s;ciples, he &s;ent <HI>Mogla</HI> and <HI>Saribout</HI> thither to bring them away. They found <HI>Thevetat</HI> preaching, and when he &s;aw them, he thought that like him they had quitted their Ma&s;ter. Wherefore after his Ser|mon, he &s;aid unto them: I know that when you were with <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> you were his two Favourites, and that he made you to &s;it one at his right hand, and the other at his left, I de&s;ire you to accept the &s;ame thing from me. Not to know him, and the better to cover their de&s;ign, they told him that they kind|ly accepted it, and &s;eated them&s;elves indeed at his &s;ides. Then he intreated them to preach in his &s;tead whil&s;t he went to repo&s;e. <HI>Saribout</HI> preached, and after his Sermon all tho&s;e 500 <HI>Talapoins</HI> arrived at the perfection of an Angel, ro&s;e up into the Air and di&s;appear'd. <HI>Conkali</HI> the Di&s;ciple of <HI>Thevetat</HI> ran to wake him and tell him, what had pa&s;t. I had well advi&s;ed you not to tru&s;t them, &s;aid he unto him: than he began to be vexed, and to &s;uch a degree, that he beat <HI>Conkali</HI> &s;o as to make his Mouth to bleed. On the other hand, when the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> which were with <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> &s;aw <HI>Mogla</HI> and <HI>Saribout</HI> return with their Company, they went immediately to acquaint their Ma&s;ter, and to expre&s;s unto him the a&s;toni&s;hment wherein they were to &s;ee <HI>Mogla</HI> and <HI>Saribout</HI> return &s;o well accompanied, after having &s;een them depart alone. <HI>Mogla</HI> and <HI>Saribout</HI> came al&s;o to &s;alute their Ma&s;ter, and the new come <HI>Talapoins</HI> told <HI>Som|mona-Codom</HI> that <HI>Thevetat</HI> imitated him in all things. You very much deceive your &s;elves, &s;aid he unto them, to think that he does what I do: formerly in|deed he Counterfeited me, but now he practi&s;es the &s;ame. Then his Di&s;ciples &s;aid unto him, we know our dear Ma&s;ter that <HI>Thevetat</HI> Counterfeits you at pre&s;ent, but that he has Counterfeited you in times pa&s;t we know nothing thereof, wherefore we de&s;ire you to explain it to us. He then open'd his mouth and

&s;aid, you know that heretofore being a Bird, but a Bird which &s;ought his living &s;ometimes in the Water, &s;ometimes on the Land, <HI>Thevetat</HI> at the &s;ame time was a Land-Fowl and had great Feet. After my example he would catch Fi&s;h, but he entangled his Neck in the Weeds, not being able to pluck it out, and died there. I remember al&s;o that I once was one of the&s;e little red Birds, which do eat the Worms of the Trees. <HI>Thevetat</HI> was a Bird of another &s;ort, and he affect|ed to nouri&s;h him&s;elf like me. I &s;ought the Worms in the Trees, which have the heart included in the middle of the Trunck, and I &s;ought out the&s;e Trees in a great and &s;pacious Fore&s;t, he &s;ought the Worms in Trees without heart, but which have an appearance thereof; and his head was brui&s;ed as a puni&s;h|ment. Another time I was born a <HI>Racha&s;i,</HI> and he was born a wild Dog. Now the <HI>Racha&s;i</HI> do live only on the Elephants which they kill in the Woods, and the Dog of the Woods would act like me, but he reapt the evil thereof: for the Elephants trampled him under their Feet and cru&s;hed him in pieces.</P>
<P>Another day <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> preaching to his Di&s;ciples, &s;pake to them of <HI>The|vetat,</HI> and &s;aid unto them. Once I was one of the Land-fowl with great Feet, and he was <HI>Racha&s;i.</HI> In eating of meat he would &s;wallow a bone, which &s;ticking in his Throat would &s;trangle him. I had compa&s;&s;ion on him, I drew the bone out of his Throat at the reque&s;t he made me, confe&s;&s;ing that what force &s;oever he had u&s;ed, yet he could not relieve him&s;elf. I entered there|fore into his great Throat, which he open'd, and pluck'd out this bone with my Beak: and as he had promi&s;ed me a recompence, I only demanded of him &s;omething to eat, but he an&s;wered me, that having permitted me to enter into his Throat, and to come out &s;afe and &s;ound, was the greate&s;t Favour he could &s;how me. Another time I was a Stag, and <HI>Thevetat</HI> a Hunter. Going one day a Hunting, he climb'd upon a Tree, which bore the little Fruits which Stags do eat, and there made him&s;elf as it were a little Hutt, to keep him|&s;elf clo&s;e and conceal'd in, expecting his Prey: and as the Stag<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">'Tis one of the names of <HI>Sommona-Co|dom.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Pouti&s;at</HI> was come very near the Tree, <HI>Thevetat</HI> threw him &s;ome Fruits to entice him to approach nearer: but the Stag <HI>Pouti&s;at</HI> &s;eeing the&s;e Fruits fall on either &s;ide, doubted of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and ob&s;erved the Hunter upon the Tree, to whom he &s;aid 'twas in vain to wait longer, that he would not approach him nearer. 'Tis thus that <HI>Thevetat</HI> de&s;ires much. Another time <HI>Thevetat</HI> was a Fi&s;herman. Having one day thrown his Line, the Hook catch'd on a Tree fallen into the water, he thought that the hook held a great Fi&s;h, and con&s;idering already that he mu&s;t &s;hare it among his Friends, he was troubled thereat, becau&s;e that the&s;e pre&s;ents would deprive him of the greate&s;t part. To prevent this inconvenience he &s;ent his Son whom he had with him, to carry unto his Wife the news of the prize he thought to catch, and orders to go immediately to quarrel with all her Neigh|bours. She then took her little dog, and repaired pre&s;ently to the neare&s;t, went into the hou&s;e, and began to &s;cold at him and his Wife: from thence &s;he went to another, and at la&s;t to them all. In the mean time <HI>Thevetat</HI> was look|ing after his Line which he could not get out, &s;o that to have it he &s;tript him|&s;elf, laid his Cloaths on the bank of the River, threw him&s;elf into the water, and gave &s;uch an unhappy blow again&s;t the Tree, that he beat out borh his Eyes. The Pa&s;&s;engers &s;tole away his Cloaths: and the quarrel of his Wife with his Neighbours, co&s;t him all the little Money he had, by a Suit which they brought again&s;t him for this injury. After this <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> departed out of the City of <HI>Rachacreu</HI> to go to <HI>Savati:</HI> he was there &s;ick in a Convent where he lodged: and at the &s;ame time <HI>Thevetat</HI> was likewi&s;e &s;ick of a di&s;temper, which held him nine Months. He had an extream de&s;ire to &s;ee his Ma&s;ter <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> and he &s;ignified it to his di&s;ciples, de&s;iring them to do him the kindne&s;s to carry him to him. They asked him how he dared to think thereof, and what Good and Succour he could expect from him, after having per&s;ecuted him &s;o much. 'Tis true, &s;aid he unto them, that for the Good he has done me, I have only return'd him Evil; but that's no matter carry me to him, that &s;ufficeth me. They obeyed him, and having laid him on an Hurdle, they &s;et out on the road, to &s;eek out <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> As they approach'd, the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Sommona-Co|dom</HI> ran to acquaint their Ma&s;ter, that <HI>Thevetat</HI> being &s;ick came to vi&s;it him. I
<PB N="156" REF="90">
know it, an&s;wered he, I know that he comes, but he &s;hall not &s;ee me. Since that you refu&s;ed him, reply'd the Di&s;ciples, the favour he demanded of you, touching the five Articles which he de&s;ired to ob&s;erve, we have not hitherto &s;een him. Upon the&s;e words <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> &s;aid unto them: <HI>Thevetat</HI> is a mi&s;erable wretch, who has always followed his own capricious humour, and never took care to keep the Rule, which I have taken &s;o much pains to teach him; wherefore, though he comes purpo&s;ely to vi&s;it me, and how good a mind &s;oever he has thereunto, yet he &s;hall not &s;ee me; becau&s;e he has endea|voured to oppo&s;e me, and rai&s;e a divi&s;ion among my Di&s;ciples. As <HI>Thevetat</HI> was within a Mile of the Place, where <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> was, his Di&s;ciples went again to adverti&s;e him thereof; and he &s;till told them, I know it very well, but yet <HI>Thevetat</HI> &s;hall not &s;ee me. When <HI>Thevetat</HI> was within a half a mile of the City, the Di&s;ciples returned to acquaint <HI>Sommona-Codom:</HI> 'Tis true, &s;aid he, yet he &s;hall not &s;ee me. When <HI>Thevetat</HI> was arrived at the Pool, which they call <HI>Bukoreni,</HI> near the place where <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> was, the <HI>Talapoins</HI> went again to <HI>Sommona Codom</HI> to tell him that he was near at hand; to which he reply'd, how near &s;oever he be yet he &s;hall not &s;ee me. <HI>Thevetat</HI> being therefore come to this Pool, his Di&s;ciples &s;et him on the ground on the bank of the water: and as he endeavoured to walk, his Feet &s;unk, and entred into the Earth, and by little and little he &s;unk up to the Neck, and then to the Chin. Seeing him|&s;elf in this condition he began to recommend him&s;elf to <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> and offer him&s;elf to him, confe&s;&s;ing that he was very perfect, very great: that he brought back Per&s;ons &s;trayed out of the good way, as does a Groom, who takes care to beat his Hor&s;es, to correct them when they are mi&s;chievous: that he knew and under&s;tood every thing: that he was full of merit. He humbled him&s;elf, acknowledged the fault he had committed, and de&s;ired pardon. Mean while <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> con&s;idering on this wretch, &s;aid unto him&s;elf, Why ha&s;t thou received him into thine hou&s;e? Why ha&s;t thou given him the habit? Would it not be better to let him continue in the world? But no, re|ply'd he, for if he was &s;etled there, he would have continued only to tran&s;gre&s;s the five<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">By this place it appears what the five Command|ments of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> are.</NOTE> Commandments, and to &s;in. He would de&s;troy the life of an infinite number of Animals: He would &s;eize on anothers e&s;tate, where-ever he could entrap it: He would be permitted to run into all &s;ort of Impurity: He would have been a Lyar and Impo&s;tor: he would always be &s;een drunk, like a Bea&s;t: and in fine, he would never have done any good, and would never have medita|ted for the Future. This is the rea&s;on why I have received him. After this <HI>Sommona Codom</HI> prophe&s;ied that after an hundred Thou&s;and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Perhaps it mu&s;t be <HI>Lan,</HI> that is to &s;ay Ten Millions, to &s;ay Ten Millions of years: as in other places of the <HI>Indies Lec</HI> is taken for an Hundred Thou&s;and years, though <HI>Lec</HI> &s;ignifies &s;imply an Hundred Thou&s;and. It is &s;een by this place how they pretend that the Souls of the wicked may purify them&s;elves by the force of Tran&s;migrati|ons. It ap|pears al&s;o that the word <HI>Pout</HI> which &s;ignifies Mercury, en|ters into this name of God, and I doubt not that the <HI>Bali</HI> Adjective <HI>Pouti</HI> comes from <HI>Pout,</HI> though I have &s;een the <HI>Sia|me&s;es</HI> write the&s;e two words with different Letters; but they are not exact in their Orthography.</NOTE> <HI>Kan, Thevetat</HI> &s;hould be a God and be named <HI>Atti&s;aripothiequepout.</HI> Mean while <HI>Thevetat</HI> was buried in the Earth, and even to Hell where he is without po&s;&s;ibility of re|moving, for want of having loved <HI>Sommona-Codom.</HI> His Body is the heighth of a <HI>Jod,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Eight Thou&s;and Fadom: he is in the Hell <HI>Avethi,</HI> 650 Leagues in greatne&s;s: on his head he has a great Iron pot all red with fire, and which came to his Shoulders: he has his Feet &s;unk into the Earth up to the Ankles, and all inflamed. Moreover a great Iron Spit which reaches from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t, pierces through his Shoulders and comes out at his Brea&s;t. Another pierces him through the &s;ides, which comes from the South, and goes to the North, and cro&s;&s;es all Hell. And another enters through his Head, and pierces him to the Feet. Now all the&s;e Spits do &s;tick at both ends, and are thru&s;t a great way into the Earth. He is &s;tanding, without being able to &s;tir, or lye down. The di&s;ciples of <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> di&s;cour&s;ed among&s;t them&s;elves of the poor <HI>Thevetat,</HI> &s;aying, that he was able to come only to the lake <HI>Bukoreni,</HI> and not to the Convent, which is near it: And <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> taking up the di&s;|cour&s;e, told them, that this was not the fir&s;t time that &s;uch a puni&s;hment had happen'd to <HI>Thevetat,</HI> to be &s;wallow'd up and buried in Hell. I remember, pur|&s;ued he, that <HI>Thevetat</HI> in one of his Generations was an Hunter, and that then I was an Elephant of the Woods. One day then as he was hunting, and as he wandered and was lo&s;t, not knowing where he was, I &s;eeing him in &s;o great an affliction had Compa&s;&s;ion upon him, I took him upon my back, drew him out of the Woods, &s;et him down near his Hou&s;e, and then returned. Going

another time a hunting, as he &s;aw me with very excellent Teeth, it came into his mind, that if he had &s;uch, he could &s;ell them very well, and hereupon he cut off the two ends of mine. Having &s;wallow'd the Silver that he had made thereof, he return'd to cut off as much more, and a third time he made an end of cutting what remain'd. I was extreamly afflicted thereat, and expre&s;&s;ed all the re&s;entments whereof I was capable: but he carry'd not his crime very far, for as he left me, the earth open'd and &s;wallow'd him up, without giving him time to ask pardon. Upon the&s;e words of <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> every one rejoiced at <HI>Thevetat</HI>'s death: And <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> &s;aid likewi&s;e, I remember that ancient|ly <HI>Thevetat</HI> was born King of the City of <HI>Parana&s;i.</HI> His name was <HI>Pingquelera|cha.</HI> He &s;o tormented his Subjects that not one of them loved him: on the contrary every one de&s;ired to &s;ee him dead: and his death happen'd when he lea&s;t expected it. Every one made publick rejoycings, except the Porter of the City, who wept heartily: and being demanded the rea&s;on thereof: Ah! &s;aid he, I weep becau&s;e that this wretch, wicked as he is, will torment the De|vils, as he has tormented us, and the Devils not being able to bear him, will re&s;tore him to us, and we &s;hall be as mi&s;erable as before. This is the cau&s;e of my Tears.</P>
<P><HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> cea&s;ing to &s;peak, the <HI>Talapoins</HI> de&s;ired him to inform them where <HI>Thevetat</HI> was then, and in what place he was gone to revive: and he told them that he was gone to revive in the great Hell <HI>Avethi:</HI> but, &s;aid they to him, is it that after having &s;uffered &s;o much in this Life, he is gone likewi&s;e to &s;uffer in Hell? yes, replyed <HI>Sommona-Codom,</HI> for you mu&s;t know that all Sinners, whatever they are, and of what condition &s;oever they may be, whether <HI>Tala|poins,</HI> or <HI>Laicks,</HI> after all the &s;ufferings of this World, will have others incom|parably greater and more grevious.</P>

<HEAD>An Explication of the <HI>Patimouc,</HI> or Text of the <HI>Vinac.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THere are four things, that we ought to do before we enter into the Expla|nation of the <HI>Patimouc,</HI> according to what <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> has taught. 1. It is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;weep the Hall where they a&s;&s;emble. 2. It is nece&s;&s;ary to light the Lamps or Wax-candles. 3. They ought to prepare water in the Spout-pots, or in other Ve&s;&s;els de&s;igned to this purpo&s;e, for tho&s;e that &s;hall de&s;ire to drink. 4. They ought to &s;pread Matts or Carpets to &s;it upon. After the di&s;ci|ples have &s;wept it, they go to tell it to the Ma&s;ter, who an&s;wers them that they have done well: then they acquaint him that they have lighted the Lamps, and the Ma&s;ter replys that it was not nece&s;&s;ary &s;eeing that the Sun &s;hines, and it is broad day. Afterwards the di&s;ciples inform him that they have brought the Water, and &s;pread the Matts: Good, &s;aid the Ma&s;ter unto them, this is good. Behold then, &s;aid the di&s;ciples to the Ma&s;ter, the&s;e four things which <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> has taught and ordain'd before they begin the reading of the <HI>Vinac.</HI> Yes, reply'd the Ma&s;ter. <HI>The Di&s;ciple.</HI> What are the four things which it is nece&s;&s;ary to do after tho&s;e which we have mentioned, and which <HI>Sommona-Codom</HI> has like|wi&s;e pre&s;cribed; are they not the&s;e? 1. When there comes in any new <HI>Tala|poins,</HI> after the explication begun, if they are fewer in number than the Audi|tors, they are obliged to declare that they believe and heartily receive what they have already explained: that if, on the contrary, tho&s;e that come are more in number than the fir&s;t, it is nece&s;&s;ary to begin again what they have al|ready read. 2. It is nece&s;&s;ary to know and to tell in what Sea&s;on of the Year it is. 3. To count the number of the Auditors. 4. To in&s;truct. Begin then, if you plea&s;e with the fir&s;t of the&s;e four things.</P>

<P>Two <HI>Kens</HI> make a Fadom, which they call <HI>Voua,</HI> and which is near an Inch le&s;s than our Toi&s;e; &s;o that within a very little their eight Grains of Rice, which do make their <HI>Fingers bredth,</HI> do amount to 9 of our Lines, which we e&s;teem equal to 9 Barly Corns.</P>

<P>The <HI>Tical</HI> is a Silver Coin, and is worth four <HI>Mayons,</HI> and it is the weight of half an Ounce, by rea&s;on of which the <HI>Cati</HI> weighs two pounds and a half.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mayon</HI> is a Silver Coin, and is worth two <HI>Fouangs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Fouang</HI> is al&s;o a Silver Money, and is worth four <HI>Payes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Paye</HI> is not a Coin, and it is worth two <HI>Clams.</HI> But the <HI>Song-Paye,</HI> that is to &s;ay the two <HI>Payes,</HI> are a Silver Coin, which is worth half a <HI>Fouang.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Clam</HI> likewi&s;e is not a Coin, but it is thought to weigh twelve Grains of Rice. This is what was told me, and upon this ground the <HI>Tical</HI> &s;hould weigh 768 grains of whole Rice, which I have not tryed.</P>
<P>All the&s;e names are not <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> but common among&s;t the <HI>Europeans</HI> which are at <HI>Siam.</HI> I know not of what Tongue the word <HI>Pic</HI> is.

<P>The word <HI>Cati</HI> is <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> and is called <HI>Schang</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>Chine&s;e Cati</HI> is worth two <HI>Siame&s;e Cati's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Teil,</HI> or as others do write <HI>Tael,</HI> is al&s;o a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> word, which is called <HI>Tam|ling</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> but the <HI>Siame&s;e Cati</HI> is worth but eight <HI>Chine&s;e Taels,</HI> whereas it is worth twenty <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> as I have &s;aid.</P>
<P><HI>Tical</HI> and <HI>Mayon</HI> are words the Origine of which I am Ignorant of, and which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Baat</HI> and <HI>Seling. Fouang, Paye</HI> and <HI>Clam</HI> are of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Language.</P>
<P>As to the Agreement of this Money with ours, to take it vulgarly, and without this exactne&s;s, which is not nece&s;&s;ary to Commerce, a <HI>Baat</HI> or <HI>Tical,</HI> although it weighs only half a Crown, yet it is worth Thirty &s;even Sols and a half of our Money, by rea&s;on of which a <HI>Cati</HI> is worth Fifty Crowns.</P>

<P><HI>Van Athit,</HI> Sunday.</P>

<P><HI>Van Angkaan,</HI> the days of <HI>Mars,</HI> or Tue&s;day.</P>

<P><HI>Van Saou,</HI> the day of <HI>Saturn,</HI> or Saturday.</P>
<P>The names of the Planets are therefore <HI>Athit, Tchan, Angkaan,</HI> &amp;c. It is true they name not the Planets without the names of the Days, without giving them the Title of <HI>Pra,</HI> which, as I have &s;everal times declared, denotes a very great excellency. Thus <HI>Pra Athit</HI> &s;ignifies the Sun, <HI>Pra Tchan</HI> the Moon, <HI>Pra Pra Prahaat</HI> Jupiter: but the word <HI>Pra</HI> is written with a P. &s;tronger than that which is in the fir&s;t &s;yllable of the word <HI>Prahaat:</HI> In &s;hort all the&s;e names are of the <HI>Baly</HI> Tongue, the Sun is called <HI>Tavan,</HI> and the Moon <HI>Doen,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e. Abraham Roger</HI> in his <HI>History</HI> of the <HI>Manners</HI> of the <HI>Bramines</HI> has given us the names of the Days in <HI>Sam&s;cortam,</HI> which, &s;aith he, is the learned Language of the <HI>Bramines</HI> of <HI>Paliacata</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coromandel.</HI> They are taken al&s;o from the Planets. <HI>Suriawaram</HI> Sunday, <HI>Jendrawaram</HI> Munday, <HI>Angaracawaram</HI> Tue&s;|day, <HI>Buttawaram</HI> Wedne&s;day, <HI>Braha&s;pitawaram</HI> Thur&s;day, <HI>Succrawaram</HI> Friday, <HI>Senniwaram</HI> Saturday. It is evident that <HI>Waram</HI> &s;ignifies Day, that <HI>Suria</HI> is the name of the Sun, perhaps with &s;ome inflection to denote the Genitive; and that <HI>Jendra</HI> is the name of the <HI>Moon,</HI> perhaps al&s;o with &s;ome inflection, which being taken away, would leave &s;ome re&s;emblance between this word, and the <HI>Bali Tchan.</HI> As to the other names, <HI>Angaraca</HI> participates enough of <HI>Angkaan: Butta,</HI> which it is nece&s;&s;ary to pronounce <HI>Boutta,</HI> is no other than <HI>Pout: Prahat</HI> agrees with the beginning of <HI>Braha&s;pita,</HI> and <HI>Succra</HI> and <HI>Souc</HI> are the &s;ame word. <HI>Senni</HI> and <HI>Saou</HI> appear more remote, and <HI>Suria</HI> and <HI>Athit</HI> have nothing common: but what the &s;ame Author adds, is remarkable, that Sunday is called <HI>Aditawa|ram</HI> in the vulgar Language of <HI>Paliacata:</HI> for it is there that we do again find the <HI>Baly</HI> word <HI>Athit.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> People under&s;tand not the Words <HI>Ai</HI> and <HI>Tgii,</HI> which are the names of the two fir&s;t Months; but it is probable that the&s;e are two old nu|merical Words, which &s;ignifie <HI>One</HI> and <HI>Two;</HI> and this is evident from the Word <HI>Tgii,</HI> becau&s;e that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do &s;ay <HI>Tgii-Sib,</HI> to &s;ignifie Twenty, which <HI>verba|tim</HI> is two Tens. All the other names of Months are &s;till in u&s;e to &s;ignifie Numbers, with this difference, that when they are put before the Sub&s;tantive, they &s;ignifie pure Numbers; and that when they are plac'd after, they become Names, which denote Order. Thus <HI>Sam Deuan</HI> &s;ignifies Three Months, and <HI>Deuan Sam,</HI> the Third Month.</P>
<P><HI>Pii</HI> &s;ignifies a Year. The Twelve Names of the Year are:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Years.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Pii ma mia,</HI> the Year of the Little Mare.</P>

<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Names are al&s;o of the <HI>Balie</HI> Tongue. Now as the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do make u&s;e of the Cycle of Sixty Years, they ought to have Sixty Names to name the Sixty Years of every Cycle; and yet the Per&s;ons, whom I have con|&s;ulted, could give me no more than Twelve, which are repeated five times in every Cycle, to arrive at the Number of Sixty: But I doubt not that it is with &s;ome additions, which do make the differences thereof; and I think to find the proof thereof in two dates of <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Letters, which I have carefully taken from the Originals. The fir&s;t is thus: <HI>In the Fir&s;t Month, the Ninth Day after the Full Moon in the</HI> Aera 2229, <HI>the Year</HI> Tchlou Sap&s;oc. And the &s;econd is thus: <HI>The Eighth Month, and the Fir&s;t Day of the Moon's Decrea&s;e in the Year</HI> Pii Tho Sap&s;oc <HI>of the</HI> Aera 2231. The Word <HI>Aera</HI> in the&s;e two dates &s;imply &s;ig|nifies <HI>Year,</HI> according to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> language; &s;o that it is all one to &s;ay the <HI>Aera</HI> 2229, and to &s;ay the Year <HI>Tchlou Sap&s;oc:</HI> to &s;ay the <HI>Aera</HI> 2231, and to &s;ay the Year <HI>Pii Tho Sap&s;oc.</HI> Be&s;ides, as the Word <HI>Pii</HI> &s;ignifies Year, they might put <HI>Tho Sap&s;oc</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Pii Tho Sap&s;oc,</HI> as they have put <HI>Tchlou Sap&s;oc,</HI> and not <HI>Pii Tchlou Sap&s;oc.</HI> Now the&s;e two Years which are the Years 1685, and 1687 of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, are not called &s;imply either by <HI>Tchlou</HI> and <HI>Tho,</HI> that is to &s;ay of the <HI>Lizard</HI> and <HI>Goat;</HI> but to the Words <HI>Tchlou</HI> and <HI>Tho,</HI> is added the Word <HI>Sa|poc,</HI> which I under&s;tand not, and which was added to the Names of the Twelfth of the Years, which run then to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the four other Twelfths of the Years of the &s;ame Cycle.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Mon&s;ons and Tides of the Gulph of <HI>Siam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE find upon our Seas, that tho' the Winds be very variable, yet they change with this almo&s;t infallible Rule, of pa&s;&s;ing from the North to the South only by the Ea&s;t; or from the South to the North, only by the We&s;t; or from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t, only by the South; or from the We&s;t to the Ea&s;t, only by the North. So that the Wind continually veers about the Heaven, pa&s;&s;ing from the North to the Ea&s;t, and from the Ea&s;t to the South; and from the South to the We&s;t, and from the We&s;t to the North; and almo&s;t never in the contrary manner: Yet in the temperate Zone, which is on the South of the Line, when we navigated tho&s;e Seas which are on the Ea&s;t of <HI>Africk,</HI> we experimented in our return from <HI>Siam,</HI> that the Winds went al|ways contrary to this Rule; but to a&s;&s;ert whether this may be always &s;o, re|quires more than one Proof. However it be, the Wind goes not &s;o in the Gulph of <HI>Siam,</HI> but it only encompa&s;&s;es the Heaven in a year; whereas on our Seas it does it in a &s;mall number of days, and &s;ometimes in one day. When in the <HI>Indies</HI> the Wind blows round the Compa&s;s in a day, it is &s;tormy: This is what they properly call a Hurricane.</P>
<P>In the Months of <HI>March, April</HI> and <HI>May,</HI> the South-wind prevails at <HI>Siam,</HI> the Heaven is di&s;order'd, the Rains begin, and are very frequent in <HI>April.</HI> In <HI>June</HI> they are almo&s;t continual, and the Winds do turn to the We&s;t, that is to &s;ay, do blow from the We&s;t and the South. In <HI>July, August,</HI> and <HI>September,</HI> the Winds are in the We&s;t, or almo&s;t We&s;t, and always accompany'd with Rains, the Waters overflowing the Earth to the breadth of nine or ten Miles, and above One hundred and fifty to the North of the Gulph.</P>
<P>During this time, and e&s;pecially towards the middle of <HI>July,</HI> the Tides are &s;o &s;trong, that they a&s;cend up to <HI>Siam,</HI> and &s;ometimes to <HI>Louvo;</HI> and they de|crea&s;e in twenty four hours with that mea&s;ure, that the Water becomes &s;weet again before <HI>Bancock</HI> in an hour; tho' <HI>Bancock</HI> be &s;even Miles from the mouth of the River, yet the Water is always &s;omewhat bracki&s;h.</P>
<P>In <HI>October</HI> the Winds do blow from the We&s;t and the North, and the Rains do cea&s;e. In <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December</HI> the Winds are North, do clear the Hea|vens, and &s;eem &s;o exceedingly to lower the Sea, that in few days it receives all the Waters of the Inundation. Then the Tides are &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, that the Wa|ter is always &s;weet two or three Leagues in the River, and that at certain hours of the day, it is the &s;ame for a League in the Road. But at <HI>Siam</HI> there never is more than an Ebb and Floud in twenty four hours. In <HI>January</HI> the Winds have already turn'd to the Ea&s;t, and in <HI>February</HI> they blow from the Ea&s;t and the South.</P>
<P>'Tis a con&s;iderable Circum&s;tance, that at the time when the Winds are in the We&s;t, or that they blow from the We&s;t, the Currents of the Gulph do ra|pidly carry the Ships on the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t, which is that of <HI>Camboya,</HI> and do hin|der them from coming back again; and that at the time when the Winds are to the Ea&s;t, or that they blow from the Ea&s;t, the Currents do run on the We&s;tern Coa&s;t, &s;o that then in Sailing it is nece&s;&s;ary to fear being bore away. Now this proves, in my opinion, that the Winds have a great &s;hare in the motions of the Sea, fora&s;much as &s;ome have proved, that the&s;e Currents are only in the upper parts of the Waters, and that underneath they have a quite contrary Current, becau&s;e that the upper Waters being continually rowled on the Shore, returns underneath towards the Coa&s;t from whence it came. After the &s;ame manner it &s;eems that they are the South-winds, which drive on the Flux, and maintain it for &s;ix Months further up in the River, and that they are the North-winds which do hinder it the entrance of the River for the &s;ix other Months.</P>

<HEAD>A De&s;cription of the principal Fruits of <HI>Siam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Figs of <HI>India,</HI> which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Clouey-ngouan-tchang,</HI> Elephant's Trunks, have not the ta&s;te of our Figs, and, in my mind, they are not &s;o good. Thus the Melons of <HI>Siam</HI> are not true Melons, but the Fruit of a Tree known in the I&s;les of <HI>America</HI> under the name of <HI>Papayer.</HI> I have not eaten of this Fruit. But to return to the Fig, it is of the &s;ize and &s;hape of a Sau&s;age. Its green Skin, which waxes yellow and &s;potted with black in its maturity, is ea&s;ily &s;eparated from its &s;oft and clammy pulp, and 'tis that which has given it the name of Fig; but in the mid&s;t of its pulp there is no vacuity, nor any of tho&s;e kernels which do make as it were a little gravel in our Figs, when they are a little dry'd. Its ta&s;te is &s;trong, and it has &s;omething of &s;harpne&s;s and &s;weet|ne&s;s both together.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bananas,</HI> which the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call <HI>Clouey-ngaa-tchang,</HI> or Elephant's Tooth, is almo&s;t the &s;ame thing as the Fig, &s;ave that it is greener and longer, and that it has Angles, and Faces or flat Sides, which are re-united point-wi&s;e at both ends. The&s;e Fruits do hang like No&s;egays, or rather like great Bunches of Grapes, from the top of the Trunk of the Trees which bear them. The Figs grow hard in the Fire, the <HI>Bananas</HI> which are not altogether &s;o delicate raw, do wax &s;oft again, do there lo&s;e their &s;weetne&s;s, and do acquire the ta&s;te of our Pip|pins ripen'd on the Apple Tree.</P>
<P>The <HI>Goyaye</HI> (in <HI>Siame&s;e Louc-Kiac, Louc</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>Son, Kiac</HI> is the name of the <HI>Goyavier</HI>) is about the &s;ize of a middling Apple. Its Skin is of a grayi&s;h green, like that of certain Pears: under this Skin is a pulp of the con&s;i&s;tence of that of the Citron, but not &s;o white. When it is put into the mouth, it &s;avors the Strawberry; but this Strawberry ta&s;te &s;oon lo&s;es it&s;elf, becau&s;e it becomes too &s;trong. This pulp, which exceeds not the thickne&s;s of a Crown-piece, contains a liquid &s;ub&s;tance like Broth, but grayi&s;h, and which would not be le&s;s plea&s;ant to eat than the pulp, if it was not mix'd with an innumerable number of &s;mall kernels &s;o hard, that it would be difficult to chew them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jacques,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e Ca-noun,</HI> are of the &s;hape of a great Melon ill rounded. Under a grayi&s;h Skin fa&s;hioned like Chagrin, they have a very great number of kernels, or &s;tones; &s;tones, if we con&s;ider their magnitude, which is almo&s;t like a Pigeon's Egg: kernels, by the thin and &s;mooth wood which inclo&s;es them. The&s;e &s;tones therefore or kernels being broil'd or boil'd, differ not from our Che&s;tnuts either in ta&s;te or con&s;i&s;tence, excepting that they are, in my opinion, more delicate. At one end they &s;tick to a pulp which invelops them all, and &s;eparates them one from the other. It is ea&s;ily torn off, according to the cour&s;e of its fibres; it is yellow, juicy, clammy, and glutinous, of a &s;weet ta&s;te, and &s;trong &s;mell. It is not po&s;&s;ible to chew it, they only &s;uck it.</P>
<P>They gave us a Fruit like to Plums, and we at the fir&s;t appearance were de|ceived. It had the pulp and ta&s;te of a Medler, and &s;ometimes two, &s;ometimes three &s;tones, but bigger, flatter, and &s;moother, than the Medler has them. This Fruit is called <HI>Mou&s;&s;ida</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Ox-heart</HI> was &s;o named by rea&s;on of its &s;ize and &s;hape. The Skin there|of is thin, and this Fruit is &s;oft, becau&s;e that on the in&s;ide it is only a kind of white Cream, and of a very agreeable ta&s;te. The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> do call it <HI>Man|cout.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Durion,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e Tourrion,</HI> which is a Fruit very much e&s;teem'd in the <HI>Indies,</HI> appear'd in&s;upportable to me for its ill &s;mell. This Fruit is of the &s;ize of our Melons cover'd with a prickly Coat like our Che&s;tnuts. It has al&s;o, like the <HI>Jacques,</HI> &s;everal &s;tones, but as big as Eggs, in which is contained what they eat, in the in&s;ide of which there is al&s;o another &s;tone. The fewer there is of the&s;e &s;tones in a <HI>Durion,</HI> the more plea&s;ant the Fruit is. There never is le&s;s than three.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mango,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e Ma-mouan,</HI> participates at fir&s;t of the ta&s;te of the Peach
<PB N="172" REF="99">
and the Apricot; toward the end this ta&s;te waxes &s;tronger, and le&s;s agreeable. The <HI>Mango's</HI> are highly e&s;teem'd, I have &s;een &s;ome as big as a Child's hand, they are flat and oval, but pointed at the two ends almo&s;t like our Almonds. Their Skin is of the con&s;i&s;tence of that of our Peaches, of colour inclining to yel|low; but their meat is only a pulp which mu&s;t be &s;uck'd, and which quits not a great flat &s;tone which it envelops.</P>
<P>I have not &s;een the <HI>Mangou&s;tan,</HI> which is &s;aid to be much better than the <HI>Mango's.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> have &s;ome &s;harp Fruits which quench the thir&s;t, and which upon this account appear'd unto me the mo&s;t agreeable of all. They are &s;mall as Plums, and have a &s;tone encompa&s;t with a white pulp, which ea&s;ily melts in the mouth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tamarinde</HI> is al&s;o &s;harp. 'Tis a Fruit enclo&s;ed in a &s;hell like an Almond, and then &s;everal of the&s;e Fruits are likewi&s;e included in a Cod. I pre&s;erved &s;ome, and found the Syrup thereof very plea&s;ant during my return; but by little and little it lo&s;t its &s;harpne&s;s, and there remain'd only the ta&s;te of the Pimper|nel. The Tree which bears it, and which is very large, has a Leaf re&s;embling Pimpernel.</P>
<P>From this Country I brought &s;everal &s;orts of liquid Sweet-meats, which were come from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Siam</HI> about two years, and they cea&s;ed not to keep very well to <HI>Paris.</HI> The Syrup e&s;pecially was very good, and had nothing of Candy, notwith&s;tanding the heat of the Climats through which it had pa&s;&s;ed. The&s;e Sweet-meats had perhaps been made with Sugar-candy, whith is the &s;ole Purifier that the Orientals have. I refer my &s;elf to the Confectioners.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not of the Sugar-canes wherewith <HI>Siam</HI> abounds, nor of the Pepper, becau&s;e I &s;aw none thereof. The King of <HI>Siam,</HI> they &s;ay, has cau&s;ed an hun|dred thou&s;and thereof to be planted. 'Tis a Plant which needs Props like the Vine, and the Pepper hangs thereon al&s;o by little Bunches, like to tho&s;e of Currents.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ananas,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e Saparot,</HI> has the meat white, and the ta&s;te of our Peaches. Its meat is mixed with a little wood, not a wood which &s;eparates, as there is in our Nuts, but with a wood that adheres thereto, and which is only the meat over-hardned; and it is at the Center that it begins to grow hard. The <HI>Ananas</HI> is believed unwhol&s;om, becau&s;e that its juice, they &s;ay, corrodes Iron. It is yellow when it is ripe, and then to &s;mell it without opening it, it has the &s;cent of a roa&s;ted Apple. Its Figure is like a great Pine Apple, it has little rindes curiou&s;ly ranged, under which, to behold them, one would think that the kernels are. The Plant which produces it bears it at the top of its &s;talk, which is not three foot high. The <HI>Ananas</HI> keeps directly upon the little end; and at the great end there is a tuft of Leaves, like little Corn-flags, &s;hort, bent outwards, and toothed. Sometimes from the body of this Fruit, and at the &s;ides, there grows like Wens, one or two other little <HI>Ananas,</HI> which have al&s;o their Tufts. Now every Tuft cut and put in the ground, may produce another <HI>Ananas,</HI> but every Plant bears only one, and bears no more than once.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coco,</HI> in <HI>Siame&s;e Ma-praou,</HI> is a kind of Filbert, but much bigger indeed than a Filbert, as may be &s;een by tho&s;e Cups of <HI>Coco</HI> which they &s;ell us. 'Tis the wood thereof which is naturally cover'd like that of our Nuts, with a <HI>brou</HI> or green bark an inch thick, and full of fibres, whereof Cordages may be made. In the wood of the <HI>Coco</HI> is a very plea&s;ant liquor, and the wood there|of is &s;o full, that it &s;purts a great way when it is pierced. As this Fruit ri|pens, this liquor congeals at the extremities, that is to &s;ay near the wood, and there forms a Nut very white, and of a very good ta&s;te; the water which is not yet congealed remains &s;till at the Center of the Fruit, and at length it all congeals.</P>

<P>This mute Character is the la&s;t in the two Alphabets, the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> and <HI>Balie.</HI> In the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> it has the figure of our <HI>o,</HI> and indeed it countervails an <HI>o,</HI> when it mu&s;t be pronounced, and not be a mute Con&s;onant, that is to &s;ay, when it is preceeded with a Con&s;onant or by it &s;elf. In the <HI>Balie</HI> Alphabet this la&s;t Chara|cter countervails <HI>ang,</HI> when it is not a mute Con&s;onant; but its figure has no re&s;emblance to any one of our Letters. Thus the fir&s;t Letter of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Alphabet, which is <HI>Aleph,</HI> &s;erves as a mute Con&s;onant, in relation to which they place the Points which are the Vowels; and it is probable that the <HI>Aleph</HI> was anciently pronounced like the <HI>Alpha</HI> of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> which has taken its name from the <HI>Aleph.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Pronunciations are very difficult for us to imitate, and they cor|re&s;pond &s;o ill to mo&s;t of ours, that of ten <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> words written in <HI>French</HI> Cha|racters, and read by a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> there will not perhaps be one, that is known and under&s;tood by a natural <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> what care &s;oever is taken to accommodate our Orthography to their Pronounciation.</P>
<P>They have the <HI>r,</HI> which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have not. They have our <HI>v</HI> Con&s;onant, but they pronounce it frequently like the <HI>w</HI> of the <HI>High-Germans,</HI> and &s;ometime like the <HI>w</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> They have likewi&s;e the <HI>ng</HI> of the <HI>Germans,</HI> which we have not: For the <HI>Germans</HI> pronounce <HI>Engel,</HI> for example, after a manner that we hardly apprehend, and which is only a <HI>g</HI> pronounc'd before the <HI>e,</HI> and the <HI>i</HI> as before the <HI>a,</HI> but very &s;oftly and much through the No&s;e.</P>
<P>They have a middle Pronunciation between our two Pronunciations of <HI>yo</HI> and <HI>jo,</HI> and from hence it is that the <HI>Europeans</HI> do &s;ay &s;ometimes <HI>Camboja,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Camboya,</HI> becau&s;e they know not how to pronounce the&s;e &s;orts of words exactly after the <HI>Siame&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis the &s;ame as to the word <HI>Kiai,</HI> which &s;ignifies, <HI>Heart.</HI> It is not known whe|ther they rather &s;ay <HI>Kiai</HI> than <HI>Ciai,</HI> pronounced after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, becau&s;e that indeed they do not exactly &s;peak either the one or the other, but &s;ome|thing which partakes of the one and the other.</P>
<P>They have our A&s;piration, which yet they pronounce very &s;oftly, and when they put the Character thereof before a Con&s;onant (which the <HI>French</HI> tongue never permits) they do it only to weaken the pronunciation of the Con&s;onant: and in general they &s;peak &s;o &s;oftly, that it is not known often whether they pronounce an <HI>m</HI> or a <HI>b, tio</HI> or <HI>tchio.</HI></P>
<P>They have not our <HI>u</HI> Vowel which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have, but they have our <HI>e,</HI> &s;uch as we pronounce it in our Mono&s;yllables, <HI>ce, le, me, que, &s;e, te:</HI> but this <HI>e</HI> &s;uffers no eli&s;ion in their Tongue as in ours. I dare even affirm that they have no other <HI>e</HI> than this, not in the Cries of the Pagayeurs, <HI>ho, he, he,</HI> which they pronounce as we would pronounce <HI>ho, heu, heu;</HI> nor in the Syllables which end with a Con&s;onant, like this, <HI>Pet,</HI> which &s;ignifies a rough Diamond, and which they rather pronounce <HI>peut,</HI> than <HI>pet.</HI></P>
<P>They have an <HI>a</HI> extreamly &s;hort, which they write with two points, thus:, and which they pronounce clearly at the end of the words, as in this <HI>Balie</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="100">
word <HI>Pra,</HI> which they give to whatever they honour mo&s;t; but when this <HI>a</HI> is found in the middle of a word, it pa&s;&s;es &s;o quick that it is not di&s;cerned, and that it an&s;wers to our <HI>e</HI> mute. Hence it is that the word <HI>Pa-ya,</HI> which we have tran&s;lated by that of Prince, and of which the fir&s;t <HI>a</HI> written with the two points, is pronounced <HI>Pe-ya,</HI> or <HI>Pia,</HI> though in the Relations we find it written <HI>Peja</HI> and <HI>Puja,</HI> by the confu&s;ion of the <HI>e</HI> mute with the <HI>u,</HI> and of the <HI>y</HI> with the <HI>j</HI> con&s;onant. This <HI>a</HI> marked with two points &s;uffers no other Letter after it in the &s;ame Syllable.</P>
<P>'Tis a thing very &s;ingular that in the Syllables which end with a Con&s;onant, they pronounce it not after our manner: but their tongue remains fix'd either to the palate of the Mouth, or to the Teeth, according to the nature of the Con&s;onant; or rather their Lips remain &s;hut: and it is thus that they termi|nate the&s;e &s;orts of pronunciations, I mean without unloo&s;ing the Tongue, and opening the Lips again. They cannot pronounce an A&s;pirate at the end of a Syllable, was it in the middle of a word. They pronounce <HI>Petpayatong,</HI> though they write <HI>Petchpayatong.</HI> The Convent of the Palace they call <HI>vat Si-Sarapet,</HI> though they write <HI>Sarapetch.</HI> Thus when they would &s;ay <HI>un oeuf</HI> they &s;aid <HI>un oeub,</HI> but they open'd not their Lips again to fini&s;h after our manner the pronun|ciation of the <HI>b.</HI> By the &s;ame rea&s;on they will pronounce an <HI>n</HI> for an <HI>r</HI> and for an <HI>l,</HI> at the end of a word, becau&s;e that at the end of the words they unloo&s;e not the Tongue from the Palate, and it is nece&s;&s;ary to unloo&s;e it in the pro|nunciation of the <HI>r</HI> or of the <HI>l:</HI> for in that of the <HI>l,</HI> the Tongue cleaves not to the Palate at &s;ides. They will write <HI>Tahar</HI> and <HI>Mar,</HI> and they will &s;ay <HI>Tahan</HI> and <HI>Man.</HI></P>
<P>They have a great deal of Accent, like the <HI>Chine&s;es:</HI> they do almo&s;t &s;ing in &s;peaking: and the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Alphabet begins with &s;ix different Characters, which do all countervail only a <HI>K,</HI> more or le&s;s &s;trong, and variou&s;ly accented. For though in the pronunciation the Accents be naturally upon Vowels, yet they do mark &s;ome by varying the Con&s;onants, which otherwi&s;e are of the &s;ame weight. From whence it is perhaps permitted to conjecture that they writ at fir&s;t without Vowels, like the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> and that at la&s;t they have marked them by &s;ome &s;trokes foreign to their Alphabet: and which for the mo&s;t part are placed out of the rank of the Letters, like the Points, which the modern <HI>Hebrews</HI> have added to their ancient manner of writing. Whoever therefore has learn'd to give the true Accent to the &s;ix fir&s;t Characters of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Alphabet, ea&s;i|ly pronounces the re&s;t; becau&s;e that they are all ranged with that art, that in their pronunciation it is nece&s;&s;ary to repeat almo&s;t the &s;ame Accents. They read the <HI>Balie</HI> Alphabet after the &s;ame manner, &s;ave that they give it only five Accents, which they repeat five times in the twenty five fir&s;t letters, the eight la&s;t having no accent. And as far as I can judge of the Han&s;crit by the Al|phabet, which Father <HI>Kirker</HI> has given us thereof in his <HI>China Illu&s;trata,</HI> this Tongue, which is the learned Tongue of the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s States, has five Accents like the <HI>Balie</HI> Tongue: for the Characters of its Alphabet are divided by fives.</P>

They &s;ay &s;even Letters at fir&s;t, and then the others &s;ix and &s;ix.</P>
<P>The little &s;troke which is between the names of two Letters, denotes that they pronounce the Letter which precedes the &s;troke very quick, and that it makes a &s;hank with the following Letter, when they &s;ay their Alphabet by heart.</P>

<HEAD>Of a fourth <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Alphabet, which I have not graved.</HEAD>
<P>THis Alphabet is of the Syllables which begin, and which end with Con|&s;onants, and it teaches two things. Fir&s;t, there are two Vowels, an <HI>a</HI> and an <HI>o,</HI> which mu&s;t never begin the Syllable nor end it, but be always be|tween two Con&s;onants. They have a particular Accent. The <HI>a</HI> is marked with a &s;harp accent &prime;, oftentimes very much lengthned, and always placed over the fir&s;t Con&s;onant of the Syllable; and the <HI>o</HI> is marked with a double Accent &s;harp &Prime;, which they put likewi&s;e over the fir&s;t Con&s;onant of the Sylla|ble. When in the pronunciation the Syllable ends not with a Con&s;onant, they put the <HI>o</HI> mute in the place of the &s;econd Con&s;onant, as may be &s;een in the Syllable <HI>Ko</HI> in the Alphabet of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Dipthongs: yet they &s;ometimes di&s;|pen&s;e therewith after the accent &prime;, which marks the <HI>a,</HI> but never after the two accents &Prime;, which mark the <HI>o.</HI> Sometimes al&s;o in&s;tead of the double accent, which marks the <HI>o,</HI> they put a little <HI>o</HI> over the fir&s;t Con&s;onant, and &s;ometimes they put nothing; and as often as two Con&s;onants make a Syllable, it is the <HI>o</HI> that mu&s;t be under&s;tood. The &s;econd thing which this Alphabet teaches, are the final Con&s;onants, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>ko,</HI> the <HI>ngo,</HI> the <HI>do,</HI> the <HI>no,</HI> the <HI>mo,</HI> and the <HI>bo.</HI> As often as they end a Syllable, with any other Con&s;onant, it is a fault again&s;t their Orthography. They pronounce the&s;e only at the end of the Syllables, and they never &s;how their Children any Syllable to read, which ends with any other Con&s;onant, than with tho&s;e I have mentioned.

<HEAD>A Smoaking In&s;trument made u&s;e of by the <HI>Moors,</HI> which are at <HI>Siam.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THey have a gla&s;s bottle of the figure of our Caraffas, excepting that it has a foot to be more firm, they fill it up half with water, and into the neck, which is all of a bigne&s;s and very long, they put a &s;ilver Pipe wound about with a Fillet, to the end that it clo&s;e the better: but this Pipe enters on|ly the length of two Fingers breadth, though it be more than half a Foot long. At the upper end is a little Cup, either of Silver or Porcelane, which has the bottom perforated to communicate with the Pipe; and in this Cup is the To|bacco, on which they put a live coal. From the &s;ide of the Pipe there proceeds another much le&s;s in form of a Spout, or rather it is the little one which en|ters into the great one at the &s;ide, and it de&s;cends within the great one, and as far as the great one it &s;elf, yet without filling the whole capacity thereof, but leaving a &s;pace through which the &s;moak of the Tobacco, which is con&s;umed in the Porcelane Cup, may de&s;cend into the Bottle. In fine, to the inferior Orifice of the little Pipe, they put another little Pipe of Bambou, bound about al&s;o with a little Ribbon or black Silk, which de&s;cends into the water. Now he that would &s;moak, &s;etting this gla&s;s bottle, or rather all this Machine which I have de&s;cribed upon the ground, puts into the &s;uperior orifice of the little &s;ilver pipe, the end of a Bambou-&s;lip, which though of one &s;ingle &s;hoot is &s;ometimes between &s;even and eight foot long. The two ends thereof are gar|ni&s;hed with Gold or Silver, and be&s;ides this one of the two is garni&s;hed with a little Chry&s;tal Pipe, which he that &s;moaks puts between his Lips. From this manner it &s;eems that in &s;moaking, he would attract to his Mouth the Water of the Bottle, by rea&s;on of the Communication that there is from the Mouth of the Smoaker to the Water of the Bottle, <HI>viz.</HI> through the great Bambou &s;lip, thro the little Silver Pipe to which it joyns, and thro the little Bambou Pipe which enters into the Water, and which unites at the lower end of the &s;mall &s;il|ver Pipe: but in&s;tead of this, the exterior air not being able to enter into the Bottle, the Smoak of the Tobacco de&s;cends along the great &s;ilver Tube, not only into the Bottle, but even into the Water, to in&s;inuate it &s;elf into the little tube of Bam|bou, from whence it a&s;cends to the Mouth of the Smoaker. So that he who inven|ted this In&s;trument, has very ingeniou&s;ly apprehended that it would be more na|tural that the Smoak &s;hould be drawn into the water, and from the water to the Mouth of the Smoaker, then that the water, which is heavier than the &s;moak, &s;hould yield to the force of this Attraction.</P>

Neither do they place their pieces in the Squares, but at the corners of the Squares, that is to &s;ay at the points where the lines of the Che&s;s-board do inter&s;ect. Moreover the Che&s;s-board is divi|ded into two halves, thirty two Squares for each of the two Players, and the&s;e two halves are &s;eparated by a &s;pace, which they call the River. It is about the bigne&s;s of a row of Squares, and runs not from one Player to the other: but after the &s;ame manner wherewith the pieces are ranged on the Che&s;s-board. 'Tis not therefore the Squares which are the Points of their game, but the cor|ners of the Squares. And &s;o they have nine Points on each line, and there are five times nine or forty five on each half of the Che&s;s-board; I have marked them with circles.</P>
<P>They have thirty two Men like us, &s;ixteen for each Game&s;ter, the one white, the other black; but the&s;e Men are not all the &s;ame as ours, and they di&s;po&s;e them not altogether after the &s;ame manner. Every Game&s;ter has a King and no Queen, two Guards, two Elephants, two Hor&s;emen, two Waggons, two Cannons, and five Pawns. Each Game&s;ter places nine Men on the fir&s;t Line of the Che&s;s-board, which is on his &s;ide, at the Points where this fir&s;t Line is divided, and on tho&s;e where it is terminated. The&s;e nine Men are, the King, whom they place in the middle; the two Guards which are next him, the one on the right and the other on the left; the two Elephants which are next the Guards, the one on the right and the other on the left; then the two Hor&s;emen, the one on the right and the other on the left; and in fine the two Waggons which take up the two corners of the Che&s;s-board. The two Cannons are placed in the &s;econd Point before the two Hor&s;emen, and the Pawns in the fir&s;t, third, fifth, &s;eventh, and ninth Points of the fourth Line, that is to &s;ay on that which is our Che&s;s-board, &s;eparates the fir&s;t Points before the Men, from the &s;econd.</P>
<P>The King makes only one &s;tep as in our Game,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The motion of their Men.</NOTE> but he cannot do it every way: he goes forward, or backward, or &s;ide ways, as do our Rooks, but he marches not bias-wi&s;e like our Bi&s;hops. Moreover he cannot &s;tir out of a Square, which is his field of Battle or his Palace, and which contains four Squares, which on our Che&s;s-board are tho&s;e, where we place the King and Queen, and the Pawns of the King and Queen.</P>
<P>The two Guards do not move al&s;o out of the Square, and they never make more than one &s;tep, but bias-wi&s;e like our Bi&s;hops, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The two Elephants do move after the manner of our Bi&s;hops, but they do always make two &s;teps, and never more nor le&s;s, and they pa&s;s not the River: they enter not into the Enemy's Camp. I under&s;tood that the Elephant is called <HI>fil</HI> in <HI>Arabia,</HI> and that it is from this word <HI>fil</HI> that we have taken that of <HI>fol</HI> or Bi&s;hop for that of our Che&s;s-men which an&s;wers to the Elephant.</P>

<P>The Waggons march like our Rooks, and may pa&s;s the River. The Cannons have al&s;o the walk of our Rooks, and may pa&s;s the River.</P>
<P>The Pawns do only make one &s;tep as among&s;t us, and they never have the liberty of making two, not even the fir&s;t time that they are u&s;ed.

Thus it is nece&s;&s;ary that there be a Man between the Can|non and the King, for that the Cannon gives Check to the King; and if the Man which is between both, is on the King's &s;ide, he who&s;e King is in Check, may free him from Check by taking away this Man, and by expo&s;ing the King before the Cannon. In a word one Cannon may &s;erve as a carriage to another Cannon.</P>
<P>Their Pawns take not bias-ways like ours, but in the natural &s;en&s;e of their walk, which is forward, when they have not pa&s;&s;ed the River: and forward or &s;ideways according to the march of our Rook, when they have pa&s;&s;ed the River.</P>
<P>One cannot put nor leave his King oppo&s;ite to the other King, when there is not a Man between both, he that &s;hould do it, or would take the Man that is between both, would him&s;elf put his own King in Check, which cannot be done, yet the King can take nothing but what is at a point near him, and ac|cording to the march of our Rook, and not according to the march of our Bi&s;hop.</P>

From whence the Learned may, at their plea&s;ure, draw their Conjectures, to decide which of the&s;e two In&s;truments is probably the Original, either the mo&s;t compound, or the mo&s;t &s;imple. The Simple &s;eems a Correction of the Compound, the Compound &s;eems to have added to the Simple, for the more facility and ex|actne&s;s in practice.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have given three different Pro&s;pects thereof, two of which are entirely new, and the third, which is that who&s;e place of view is in the Road, is copied after a very good <HI>Dutch</HI> Map.</P>
<P>Every one knows that the <HI>Dutch</HI> have an important E&s;tabli&s;hment there, which &s;ecures their Navigation from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> The Fort which defends it, would perhaps be no con&s;iderable thing in <HI>Europe;</HI> but it is &s;ufficient in a Country, where there is no Neighbour to fear, and where there can go no con|&s;iderable Enemy, but from a great di&s;tance, and con&s;equently with a great deal of difficulty.</P>
<P>The Company's Garden, the Platform whereof is in one of the&s;e Prints, is very &s;pacious, as may be judged by comparing it to the Fort: And tho' the Soil be not over-good, it plentifully produces Coleworts, Citruls, Oranges, Pomegranets, and, in a word, Pul&s;e and Fruits, which keep at Sea, and of which the Mariners are de&s;irous in long Voyages. In a corner, and under a &s;helter, I &s;aw a Camphire-Tree, an <HI>European</HI> Fig-Tree, and a Shrub about two Foot high, which was &s;aid to be that which bears the Tea, and which I had taken for a young Pear-Tree. It had neither Flowers nor Fruit, and very few Leaves. Clo&s;e by, and under another &s;helter, were two or three Foot of <HI>Ananas,</HI> and this was all the Rarity they &s;how'd me for the Country. The Grape is not more rare, but there is only that which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have planted there. The Wine thereof is white, and very good. Some of our Crew went to the top of the Table Mountain, to &s;eek &s;ome extraordinary Plants, but they found none. Neverthele&s;s, upon a &s;trict Scrutiny, there is not any that has not &s;omething particular, which the Plants of the&s;e Countries have not. The &s;hells there found are not the Remains of the Deluge, as &s;ome have conjectur'd. The Birds, the Apes, and the <HI>Hotantots,</HI> do bring them, and leave them there.</P>
<P>The Walks of the Garden do almo&s;t &s;pontaneou&s;ly maintain them&s;elves, be|cau&s;e that the Soil produces only Mo&s;s if it is not cultivated: Be&s;ides the neat|ne&s;s of the Garden has nothing, which &s;avours not a wi&s;e oeconomy, nor any thing which &s;avours a too great negligence, like a Kitchen Garden of Mer|chants, more wedded to the profit, which they reap thence, than to the Plea|&s;ures, which they could not enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="106">The water which waters it through &s;everal little Channels, enters therein at the going out from a Mill which it turns, and underneath the Garden, it &s;erves for blanching. They only divert a part thereof, which is conducted to a Ci&s;tern, which is on the bank of the Road, and where the Ships do go to take in their fre&s;h water.</P>
<P>The Garden is divided into &s;everal great Squares, almo&s;t like the Plot of the place Royal. They are encompa&s;&s;ed with Pales, to &s;helter them from the Winds, which are &s;ometimes furious enough to wreck the Ships in the Road, if they have not good Anchors and good Cables. The&s;e Winds are formed of the thick Clouds, which do &s;ometimes a&s;&s;emble between the Table-Moun|tain, and that which is called the Mountain of the Wind, by rea&s;on of the&s;e Storms. A walk of Citron-trees and Orange-trees planted in Earth, which go from one end of the Garden to the other, do altogether re&s;ent their fury. Next to this the &s;ituation of the Garden, and that of the Village which is a little nearer to the Road, are very good; for they are wholly expo&s;ed to the Sun, and &s;heltered from the South Winds, which are the cold Winds of this Coun|try. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> which are &s;etled there, do &s;ay, that if the South-we&s;t Wind blows not during their Summer, which is our Winter, the Di&s;tempers of the Lungs are frequent and dangerous.</P>
<P>The &s;hort &s;tay that I made, permitted me not througly to in&s;truct my &s;elf concerning the Manners of the <HI>Hotantots,</HI> the natural Inhabitants of the Cape, though in the extream Simplicity in which they live, this can be no long &s;tudy. They are called <HI>Hotantots,</HI> becau&s;e that when they dance, they always in &s;inging &s;ay this word <HI>Hotantot.</HI> The Love of the Tobacco and Brandy, which the Stran|gers offer them, and which has made them to receive the <HI>Hollanders</HI> into their Country, makes them to dance &s;o long as one will, that is to &s;ay, to &s;tamp &s;ometimes with one Foot, and &s;ometimes with the other, as he that treads the Grapes, and ince&s;&s;antly, and vigorou&s;ly to &s;ay, <HI>Hotantot, Hotantot,</HI> but with a very low voice, as if they were out of breath, or that they fear'd to awaken any one. This mute Song has no diver&s;ity of Tones, but of Mea&s;ure: the two fir&s;t Syllables of <HI>Hotantot</HI> are always two Blacks, or Crochets, and the la&s;t always a White or Minime.</P>
<P>They go all naked, as may be &s;een in the figure, which I have given. They have but one skin over their Shoulders, like a Cloak; yet do they quit it at every place: and then they have only a little Leather Pur&s;e, hung to their Neck by a &s;tring, and a piece of a Skin a little bigger than one's Hand, hung before, and fa&s;tned with another &s;tring round their body: but this little piece covers them not, either when they &s;how them&s;elves &s;ide-ways, or when they do make a brisk motion.</P>
<P>Their &s;tature is acceptable, and their gate more ea&s;y, than can be expre&s;&s;ed. They are born as white as the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but they have their Hair very much frizled, and Features participating &s;omewhat of tho&s;e of the <HI>Negro's:</HI> and be|&s;ides they are always very black; becau&s;e that they grea&s;e their Body and Face. They do al&s;o grea&s;e their Head, and we &s;mell them twenty Paces, when they have the Wind. Our men gave them Pots, and Cauldrons to bath in; and before all things, they took the Fat by hands-full, and herewith anointed their whole Body, from the Head to the Feet. The Grea&s;e defends them from the Air and the Sun, renders them &s;ound and well di&s;po&s;ed, and they prefer the&s;e natural Advantages before Sweet Scents and Plea&s;ure. They are &s;o active, that &s;everal among them do out-run Hor&s;es. There is no Brook which they &s;wim not over. They are expert in drawing the Bow, and throwing the Dart; and they have Courage even to Undauntedne&s;s. They do &s;ometimes wor&s;t a Lion, provided they have Skins enough, and Furniture enough to gar|ni&s;h their left Arm. They do thru&s;t it thus into the Throat of this Animal, and they pierce it with a Dart or Knife, which they will have in their right hand. If they are two, the one kills the Lion, whil&s;t the other amu&s;es him. If they are &s;everal, and they have nothing to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the Claws of the Lion, they fail not to expo&s;e them&s;elves all at once: The one of them generally peri&s;hes, but the Lion peri&s;hes likewi&s;e by the Blows which
<PB N="185" REF="106">
the others give him. Sometimes they are all &s;aved, and they kill the Lion.</P>
<P>Their Wives do likewi&s;e grea&s;e them&s;elves, though they affect &s;ome Orna|ment; as to fa&s;ten little Bones and Shells to their &s;hort Cottony, and grea&s;ie Hair. They al&s;o have Necklaces with divers colors of Gla&s;s, Bone, or &s;uch other matter, according as the Foreigners do give them, or &s;ell them to them. On each Leg they have fifty Rings of Leather, which do beat one upon the other, and make &s;ome Noi&s;e when they dance, and which defend them from the Briers, when they go to get Wood: for this care concerns them, and not their Husbands.</P>
<P>The Men and the Women did eat Guts, almo&s;t without clean&s;ing them, when our men pre&s;ented them therewith, and they did hardly put them a mo|ment on the Coals. If we offer'd them Brandy, they would gather up the fir&s;t Shell, they found on the ground to receive it, and after having blow'd therein, they u&s;ed to drink in it. They eat their Lice, as well as the <HI>Cochinchine&s;e:</HI> and when we thought it &s;trange, they an&s;wer'd plea&s;antly, that 'tis becau&s;e their Lice eat them.</P>
<P>They lodge under little Huts made of Branches, or great Bulru&s;h Mats, the top of which hardly reach'd to my middle; and to me it &s;eem'd that I could not lye therein, my whole length. Under the&s;e Mats they make a hole in the ground, and in this Hole, about two Foot deep, they make their Fire, not caring for the Smoak, whereof their Huts do not empty them&s;elves. They live on Hunting, Fi&s;hing, Milk and the Fle&s;h of their Flocks.</P>
<P>In this Poverty they are always merry, &s;inging and dancing continually, liv|ing without Pains and Bu&s;ine&s;s: and caring for Gold and Silver, only as far as it is nece&s;&s;ary for them to buy a little Tobacco and Brandy; a Corruption which the Foreign Commerce has introduced into their Cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>As &s;ome among&s;t them were exerci&s;ing them&s;elves, in throwing the Dart before us, I offer'd them five or &s;ix Papers of Necklaces with Beads of colou|red Gla&s;s; and they all &s;o exactly &s;eized my Hand, that I could not open it to let go the Necklaces, and I could not be&s;ides explain my &s;elf unto them. I was &s;ometime in this perplexity, till they perceived that they mu&s;t &s;et me at Liberty to obtain what they de&s;ired. They love the&s;e Necklaces for their Wives, and when we had &s;et &s;ail again, I under&s;tood that a Laquais of ours had &s;old one for a Crown to one of them. The little Money they have, and of which they have little e&s;teem, is the Wages for the Service which they ren|der &s;ometimes to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and to the other Foreigners, which land at the <HI>Cape:</HI> but they care but little to work.</P>
<P>Every one has but one Wife, their Chief only has three, and Adultery among&s;t them is puni&s;hed with Death. They kill their Children, when they have too ma|ny: and as they marry tho&s;e which they keep, exceeding young, there is &s;een among&s;t them a great many Grand-Daughters, already Widows; who want a Joynt in their little Finger: For when a Woman lo&s;es her Husband, &s;he cuts off a Joynt of the little Finger, or of the fourth Finger, if &s;he has &s;o often been a Widow, as to have her whole little Finger cut off. Neverthele&s;s &s;he may di&s;pence therewith, if &s;he plea&s;e: and there are &s;ome Husbands who di&s;pence not therewith, when they have lo&s;t their Wife. Mo&s;t of them do make them&s;elves Ridgils, to be more fit for the Women; and when the Age of renouncing comes, they make them&s;elves entirely Eunuchs, to deprive them&s;elves wholly of their Commerce, and to enjoy a more vigorous old Age. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> had edu|cated an <HI>Hotantot</HI> Infant after the <HI>European</HI> manner, and had &s;ent him into <HI>Holland.</HI> Sometime after they cau&s;ed him to return to the Cape, where he might be u&s;e|ful to them among&s;t tho&s;e of his own Nation. But &s;o &s;oon as he found him&s;elf again among&s;t them, he continued there, and renounced the <HI>Dutch</HI> Habit, and Manner of living.</P>
<P>They commit no Robbery among&s;t them&s;elves, nor in the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> where they are received without Care: and if the thing happens, they puni&s;h it with Death. Neverthele&s;s in the Country, when they can do it &s;e|curely, and that they think not to be di&s;covered, they do &s;ometimes a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate to rob; and do &s;how that the Contempt of Riches is, among&s;t them, only the Hatred of work.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="107">The <HI>Dutch</HI> do nominate their Chief, and this Chief is their Judge: but tho&s;e who could not bear this Foreign Dependance, are gone further into the Coun|try, to live with the other <HI>Caffres.</HI></P>
<P>Some informed me at fir&s;t, that they had no &s;ence of Religion; but at la&s;t I under&s;tood, that tho they have neither Prie&s;ts nor Temples, yet they make public rejoycing, which &s;avor of Wor&s;hip, at the New and Full Moons. I &s;u&s;pect that they have &s;ome Tincture of <HI>Manichei&s;me,</HI> becau&s;e that they acknow|ledge a Principle of Good, and another of Evil, which they call the <HI>Captain above,</HI> and the <HI>Captain below.</HI> The <HI>Captain above,</HI> they &s;ay, is good, it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pray to him, 'tis only needful to let him act freely, he always does good: But the <HI>Captain below</HI> is wicked, he mu&s;t be prayed to, and intreated to divert him from mi&s;chief. 'Tis thus that they &s;peak, but it appears not in their exterior Conduct, that they pray much. A <HI>Dutchman</HI> of Wit and Knowledge informed me, that among&s;t the <HI>Hotantots,</HI> he had found the Names of <HI>A&s;drubal</HI> and of <HI>Bocchus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Rules of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> A&s;tronomy, for calculating the Moti|ons of the Sun and Moon, tran&s;lated from the <HI>Siame&s;e,</HI> and &s;ince examined and explained by <HI>M. Ca&s;&s;ini,</HI> a Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MOn&s;ieur de la Loubere,</HI> the King's Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary at <HI>Siam</HI> brought back a <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> Manu&s;cript, which comprehends the Rules for calcula|ting the motions of the Sun and Moon, according to the method of that Country, the Tran&s;lation thereof he likewi&s;e brought from <HI>Siam,</HI> and commu|nicated unto me.</P>
<P>This method is extraordinary. They make no u&s;e of Tables; but only of the Addition, Sub&s;traction, Multiplication, and Divi&s;ion of certain numbers, of which we do not pre&s;ently di&s;cern the Ground, nor to what the&s;e numbers refer.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e numbers are conceal'd divers Periods of Solar Years, of Lunar Months, and other Revolutions, and the Relation of the one with the other. Under the&s;e numbers are likewi&s;e conceal'd &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Epoches</HI> which are not di&s;tingui&s;hed, as the Civil Epoche, the Epoche of the Lunar Months, that of the Equinoxes, Apogaea, and Solar Cycle. The numbers in which the difference between the&s;e Epoches con&s;i&s;ts, are not ordinarily at the head of the Operations to which they &s;erve, as they ought to be according to the Natural Order: they are often mixed with certain numbers, and the Sums or differen|ces are multiplied or divided by others, for they are not always &s;imple numbers, but frequently they are Fractions, &s;ometimes Simple, &s;ometimes Compound, without being ranged after the manner of Fractions, the Numerator being &s;ometimes in one Article, and the Denominator in another; as if they had had a contrived de&s;ign to conceal the Nature and U&s;e of the&s;e numbers. In the Calculation of the Sun, they intermix &s;ome things which appertain only to the Moon, and others which are not nece&s;&s;ary, either to the one or to the other, without making any di&s;tinction. They confound together the Solar and the Luni&s;olar Years, the Months of the Moon, and the Months of the Sun, the Civil and the A&s;tronomical Months, the Days Natural and the Days Artificial. The Zodiack is divided &s;ometimes into twelve Signs, according to the number of the Month of the Year, &s;ometimes into 27 parts, according to the number of the Days that the Moon runs through the Zodiack, and &s;ometimes in 30 parts, according to the number of the Days, that the Moon returns to the Sun. In the Divi&s;ion of the Day there is no di&s;cour&s;e of Hours; but therein is found the 11^t^h the 703^d and the 800^t^h parts of the Day, which re&s;ult from the Arithmetical Operations which are pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>This Method is ingenious; and being illu&s;trated, rectified, and purged from
<PB N="187" REF="107">
Superfluities, it will be of &s;ome u&s;e, being practicable without books, by the means of divers Cycles, and of the difference of their Epoches. Wherefore it is that I have endeavoured to decypher it, what difficulty &s;oever I found at fir&s;t, not only by rea&s;on of the confu&s;ion which every where appeared, and of the Names which are wanting in the &s;uppo&s;ed numbers; but likewi&s;e by rea|&s;on of the extraordinary names, which are given to what re&s;ults from the Ope|rations, of which there are more than Twenty which have not been interpreted by the Tran&s;lator, and of which I could never have found the Signification, if I had not fir&s;t di&s;cover'd the method; which has likewi&s;e evinced to me, that the Interpretation, which the Tran&s;lator has made of three or four other names, is not very exact.</P>
<P>In this re&s;earch I have fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed, and &s;eparated from the other num|bers, tho&s;e which belong to the Epoches, having ob&s;erved that the&s;e numbers, are tho&s;e which were given to add or to &s;ub&s;tract, either &s;imply, or by dividing or multiplying them by certain other numbers.</P>
<P>Secondly, I have con&s;idered the Analogies which re&s;ult from the Multiplica|tions and Divi&s;ions of the other numbers, &s;eparated from the Epoches; and it is in the Terms of the&s;e Analogies, that I have found the Periods of the Years, of the Months, and of the Days, and the differences of the one from the other, which the experience of things A&s;tronomical, and the occa&s;ion of divers opera|tions which I have made, has given me to under&s;tand.</P>
<P>I thought that the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, to whom A&s;tronomy gives admittance among&s;t the great and learned throughout the Ea&s;t, might reap &s;ome advantage from this work, for the Under&s;tanding, and for the Explication of the Oriental A&s;tronomy, which might ea&s;ily be rectified and adapted to ours, with a little altering the Method, by correcting the numbers which it u&s;es.</P>
<P>I thought al&s;o that it would not be u&s;ele&s;s to reduce the A&s;tronomy of <HI>Eu|rope</HI> to this form, to be able to &s;upply the want of the Tables which greatly abridge the work. This method would be much more ea&s;ie to practi&s;e in the form of the <HI>Julian</HI> and <HI>Gregorian</HI> year of which we make u&s;e, than in the form of the Luni&s;olar year, which the Orientals ob&s;erve: for their principal difficulty con&s;i&s;ts in reducing the Luni&s;olar years and the Civil Lunary months to the years and months of the Sun, which the form of our Kalender immedi|ately gives us; and what has given me the mo&s;t trouble, has been to find out the method which they u&s;e to reduce them, in which the &s;everal &s;orts of Years, Months and Days, which are &s;uppo&s;ed and &s;ought, are not di&s;tingui&s;hed. Wherefore the rea&s;on of the Explication which I give, and of the Determina|tion of the Genus to the Species which I make in the beginning, will not pre|&s;ently be under&s;tood; but in the &s;equel it will be comprehended by the Con|nexion of things, and by what nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults therefrom.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Concerning the A&s;tronomical Epocha of this Method.</HEAD>
<P>I Have endeavoured to di&s;cover what is the <HI>Epocha,</HI> from whence they here begin to compute the Motions of the Sun and Moon; and to what year, what month, and what day of our Kalender it refers: for it is not treated of in this extract, which &s;uppo&s;es it either known, or explained perhaps in the preceding Chapters from whence this extract has been taken, &s;eeing that with|out the knowledge of the <HI>Epocha,</HI> it is ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to practice this Me|thod.</P>
<P>I have found that this <HI>Epocha</HI> is A&s;tronomical, and that it is different from the Civil, which I have under&s;tood, becau&s;e it is here pre&s;cribed to begin to com|pute the Months of the Year, current with the fifth Month in the Leap Year, which con&s;i&s;ts of 13 Months, and with the &s;ixth Month in the common Year, which con&s;i&s;ts of 12 Months. For this would not be intelligible, if they &s;up|po&s;ed not two different <HI>Epoches</HI> of Years, the one whereof, which mu&s;t be the
<PB N="188" REF="108">
A&s;tronomical, begins &s;ometimes in the fifth, and &s;ometimes in the &s;ixth Month of the other, which is the Civil. That which likewi&s;e evinc'd to me that the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epoche,</HI> is different from the Civil <HI>Epocha,</HI> not only in the Months, but al&s;o in the Years, is the Operation which is here made to find the Year of ones Nativity, by &s;ub&s;tracting his Age from the number of the Years elaps'd &s;ince the <HI>Epocha;</HI> for this Operation would be u&s;ele&s;s, if they demand only the Year of the Birth after the Civil <HI>Epocha,</HI> which is immediately known, and which is compared to the Year current, to know the Age of a Per|&s;on.</P>
<P>This being &s;uppo&s;ed, I have fir&s;t &s;earched out the Age to which this A&s;tro|nomical <HI>Epocha</HI> may refer; and having found in the Calculation of the Sun, performed by this method, that two Signs and twenty Degrees which are therein employed, can only denote the place of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> where was found the <HI>Apogaeum</HI> of the Sun in the <HI>Epocha,</HI> which <HI>Apogaeum</HI> mu&s;t be in the twentieth Degree of <HI>Gemini;</HI> I judged that this <HI>Epocha</HI> mu&s;t be about the &s;eventh Age, where the <HI>Apogaeum</HI> of the Sun is found in the twentieth Degree of <HI>Gemini</HI> ac|cording to mo&s;t A&s;tronomical Tables.</P>
<P>Secondly, having found that the number 621, which is intermixed in the Calculation of the Sun, can only be the number of the days comprized, be|tween the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha,</HI> and the return of the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> to the beginning of the <HI>Zodiack;</HI> and that the number 3232, which is afterwards employed therein, can be only the number of the Days, during which, this <HI>Apogaeum</HI> makes a Revolution; I have confirmed that the <HI>Apogaeum</HI> of the Moon, which in 621 Days makes two Signs and nine Degrees, was in this <HI>Epocha,</HI> in the 21 Degrees of <HI>Capricorn:</HI> And becau&s;e that the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> by the Re|volution it makes in eight Years three quarters, returns to the &s;ame degree of the <HI>Zodiack</HI> twelve times in one Age; I have di&s;tingui&s;hed the Years of the Age, in which the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> is found in this Degree, and I have excluded the other Year.</P>
<P>Thirdly, having found by the method here u&s;ed for Calculating the place of the Sun, that this A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> is very near the vernal Aequinox, which in the &s;eventh Age fell on the 20^t^h or 21^&s;^t of <HI>March;</HI> Among&s;t the&s;e &s;elect Years I have found one in which the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> arrived at this Degree of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> about the 21^&s;^t of <HI>March,</HI> which is found but once in 62 Years, wanting &s;ome Degrees; and I have found that in the 638^t^h Year of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the <HI>Apogaeum</HI> of the Moon was at the 21&s;t Degree of <HI>Capricorn</HI> the 21&s;t of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, I have remarked that this A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> mu&s;t have begun at a new Moon; becau&s;e the Lunar Months are reduced into Days, to find the number of the Days from the <HI>Epocha,</HI> and the value of the whole Months being deducted from the Sum of the Days, the re&s;t &s;erves to find the Moon's di&s;tance from the Sun.</P>
<P>In the 638^t^h Year of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Aequinoxial new Moon happened the 21&s;t of <HI>March</HI> at three a Clock in the Morning at <HI>Siam,</HI> when the Sun by its middle Motion ran through the fir&s;t degree of <HI>Aries,</HI> the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> be|ing in the 20^t^h Degree of <HI>Gemini,</HI> and the Moon's in the 21&s;t Degree of <HI>Capri|corn.</HI> This Day was likewi&s;e remarkable for a great Eclip&s;e of the Sun, which happened the &s;ame day, but 14. Hours after the mean Conjunction.</P>
<P>Fifthly, By the manner of finding the day of the week, which is here ob&s;er|ved, it appears that the day of the <HI>Epocha,</HI> was a <HI>Saturday;</HI> and the 21^&s;^t of <HI>March,</HI> in the Year 638 was al&s;o a <HI>Saturday.</HI> This likewi&s;e confirms the cer|tainty of this Epocha, and demon&s;trates the Knowledge and Judgment of tho&s;e that have e&s;tabli&s;hed it, who contented not them&s;elves with a Civil Epo|cha, as other A&s;tronomers have done: but who have cho&s;en an A&s;tronomical one, which was the Natural Principle of &s;everal Revolutions, which could not begin again, till after &s;everal Ages. This <HI>Epocha</HI> is 5 Years and 278 Days di&s;tant from the <HI>Per&s;ian Epocha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;degerdes,</HI> the fir&s;t year of which began on the 16^t^h of <HI>June,</HI> in the Year of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, 632. Yet the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Rules are not taken from the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tables related by <HI>Cri&s;ococa;</HI> for the&s;e Tables do make
<PB N="189" REF="108">
the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> two degrees more backward, and the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> above &s;ix degrees forwarder; which agrees not &s;o exactly with our modern Tables. The <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tables do al&s;o make the Sun's Aequation 12 Minutes le&s;s, and that of the Moon 4 Minutes greater; which agrees better with the Moderns.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Rules are not drawn neither from the Tables of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> where the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> is fixed to the 5^t^h degree and a half of <HI>Gemini;</HI> nor from the other Tables &s;ince made, which have all this moveable <HI>Apogaeum.</HI> It &s;eems there|fore that they have been invented by the <HI>Indians;</HI> or that perhaps they have been taken from the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> A&s;tronomy, as may be conjectured from this, that in this extract the Numbers are written from the top downwards, after the manner of the <HI>Chine&s;es:</HI> but it may be that this way of writing the numbers might be common to the&s;e two Nations.</P>
<P>Having found the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> of this method, and the Relation it has with the <HI>Julian</HI> years; we may rectifie the <HI>Epocha</HI>'s of the motions of the Sun and Moon by the modern Tables, by adding about a Minute a Year to the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> and by correcting the other Periods. Thus there will be no difficulty, to reduce the Years and Months &s;ince the <HI>Epocha</HI> into days; and if the Equations are likewi&s;e corrected conformably to the modern Tables, we &s;hall by the &s;ame Method, find the place of the Sun and Moon with a great deal more exactne&s;s. We will give this Correction, with the Supplement of what is wanting in the&s;e Rules, after that we have explained them.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Of the particular <HI>Epocha</HI>'s of the <HI>Indian</HI> Method.</HEAD>
<P>HAving explained the Rules compri&s;ed in the preceding Sections, and found our &s;everal Periods of Years, Months, and Days, which they &s;uppo&s;e: It remains to us particularly to explain divers particular <HI>Epocha's,</HI> which we have found in the numbers employed in this Method, which being compared toge|ther may &s;erve to determine the Year, the Month, the Day, the Hour, and the Meridian of the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha,</HI> which is not &s;poken of in the <HI>Indian</HI> Rules, which &s;uppo&s;e it known.</P>
<P>By the Rules of the I. Section, is &s;ought the number of the Lunary Months elap&s;ed from the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha.</HI> The <HI>Epocha</HI> which they &s;uppo&s;e in this Section is therefore that of the Lunar Months; and con&s;equently it mu&s;t be at the Hour of the middle Conjunction from whence begins the Month wherein the <HI>Epocha</HI> is.</P>
<P>By the Rules of the II. Section, they fir&s;t reduce the Lunar Months elap&s;ed from the <HI>Epocha</HI> into Artificial Days of 30 <HI>per men&s;em,</HI> which are &s;horter than the Natural Days, from one Noon to the other, by 11/703 a Day, that is to &s;ay by 22 Minutes 32 Seconds of an Hour. The&s;e Artificial Days have therefore their beginning at the new Moons, and at every thirtieth part of the Lunar Month; but the Natural Days do always begin naturally at Midnight under the &s;ame Meridian. The Term of the Artificial Days agrees not then with the Term of the Natural Days, in the &s;ame Hour and &s;ame Minute, unle&s;s when the Month, or one of the 30 parts of the Month, begins at Midnight under the Meridian given at the choice of the A&s;tronomer. After this common beginning the end of the Artificial Day, prevents the end of the Natural Day under the &s;ame Meridian 11/703 a Day, in which does then con&s;i&s;t the <HI>Anamaan,</HI> which always augments one 703^d of a Day to every eleventh part of the Day, until that the number of the 703 parts, amounts to 703, or &s;urpa&s;&s;es this number; for then they take 703 of the&s;e parts for a Day, whereby the number of the Arti|ficial Days &s;urpa&s;&s;es the number of the Natural Days, elaps'd &s;ince the <HI>Epocha;</HI> and the remainder, if there is any, is the <HI>Anamaan.</HI> The day of this meeting or concour&s;e of the term of the Artificial days with the term of the Natural Days under the Meridian which is cho&s;en, is always a new <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Ana|maan,</HI>
<PB N="200" REF="114">
which is reduced to nothing, or to le&s;s than 11, after having attained this number 703; which arrives only at every Period of 64 Days, as it ap|pears in dividing 703 by 11, and more exactly eleven times in 703 Days. At every time given for the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Anamaan</HI> they then take the Day of the preceeding rencounter of the beginning of the Artificial Days with the begin|ning of the Natural Days, which under the &s;ame Meridian happens only five or &s;ix times in a Year.</P>
<P>Seeing then that in the fifth Article of the II. Section, they add 650 ele|venths of a Day to tho&s;e which are elap&s;ed from the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the I. Section, they &s;uppo&s;e that this <HI>Epocha</HI> was proceeded from another <HI>Epocha</HI> which could only be that of the <HI>Anamaan,</HI> of 650 elevenths of a Day; that is to &s;ay of 59 Days 1/11<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, which do give 650/703 of a Day for the <HI>Anamaan,</HI> under the Meridian of the <HI>East Indies,</HI> to which the Rules of this II. Section are accommodated; which &s;hows that under this Meridian the middle Conjunction which gave be|ginning to the Artificial Day &s;ince the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha,</HI> was 650/703 of a Day before the end of the Natural Day in which this conjunction happen'd; And con&s;equently that it happen'd at one a Clock 49 Minutes in the morning, under the Meridian which is &s;uppo&s;ed in the &s;ame Section: but in the 9^t^h Article of the 10^t^h Section, they deduct 40 Minutes from the motion of the Moon; and in the 8^t^h Article of the 7^t^h Section, they deduct 3 minutes from the mo|tion of the Sun: which removes the Moon 37 minutes from the Sun, at the hour that they &s;uppo&s;e the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, in the II. Section.</P>
<P>Wherefore I have judged that the 40 minutes taken from the motion of the Moon, and the 3 minutes taken from the motion of the Sun, do re&s;ult from &s;ome difference between the meridian to which the&s;e Rules were accommo|dated at the beginning, and of another meridian to which they have &s;ince re|duced them: &s;o that under the meridian &s;uppo&s;ed in the II. Section, the new Moon in the <HI>Epocha</HI> arrived at one a Clock 49 minutes in the morning; but un|der the meridian which is &s;uppo&s;ed in the 9^t^h Article of the X. Section, at the &s;ame hour of I. and 49 minutes after midnight, the Moon was di&s;tant from the Sun 37 minutes, which it makes in an hour 13 minutes; therefore under the Meridian &s;uppo&s;ed in the 9^t^h Article of the X. Section, the new Moon could not arrive till 3 a Clock 2 minutes after midnight. The meridian to which the&s;e Rules have been reduced, would therefore be more oriental than the meridian cho&s;en at the beginning by 1 hour 13 minutes, that is to &s;ay, 18 degrees and a quarter; and having &s;uppo&s;ed that they have reduced them to the meridian of <HI>Siam,</HI> they would be accommodated from the beginning, al|mo&s;t, to the meridian of <HI>Nar&s;inga.</HI></P>
<P>What more convinces that this &s;ub&s;traction of 40 minutes from the motion of the Moon, and of three minutes from the motion of the Sun, is cau&s;ed from the difference of the meridians of 1 hour 13 minutes, is that in 1 hour 13 mi|nutes the Moon makes 40 minutes, and the Sun 3. 'Tis therefore by the &s;ame difference of 1 hour 13 minutes, that they have deducted 3 minutes from the motion of the Sun, and 40 minutes from the motion of the Moon.</P>
<P>Without this corre&s;pondence of what they have deducted from the motion of the Sun, with what they have taken from the motion of the Moon, which appears to have for foundation the &s;ame difference of time, and con&s;equently the &s;ame difference of meridians, one might have rea&s;on to believe that the &s;ub&s;traction of the&s;e 40 minutes has been made a long time after the&s;e fir&s;t rules; becau&s;e that it is perceived in proce&s;s of time, that the motion of the Moon was not exactly &s;o quick, as it re&s;ults from the preceding Rules, which do make the lunar month about three quarters of a &s;econd &s;horter than the modern Ta|bles; and this difference amounts to 1 hour and 13 minutes in 450 years, or there|abouts. Thus, if 450 years after the <HI>Epocha</HI> they had compared the fir&s;t rules to the ob&s;ervations, one might have judged that the Moon retarded, in re&s;pect of the&s;e fir&s;t rules, 1 hour and 13 minutes, or 40 minutes of a degree. But this difference, which is always the &s;ame, when attributed to the difference of the meridians, would not be always the &s;ame if it depended on the motion of
<PB N="201" REF="114">
the Moon, for it would augment one minute to 12 years; to which 'twould be nece&s;&s;ary to have regard in the Correction of the&s;e Rules.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> The Determination of the A&s;tronomical Epocha of the <HI>In|dian</HI> Method.</HEAD>
<P>SEeing that the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Rules have been brought from <HI>Siam,</HI> and that the Civil year of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> begins in the &s;ea&s;on that we think it ought to be|gin according to the Rules of the I. Section, as we &s;hall &s;how in the &s;equel, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that the meridian to which the&s;e Rules have been re|duced by the additions mentioned in the VII. and X. Sections, is the meridian of <HI>Siam:</HI> therefore by the calculation which we have made, the new Moon which they have taken for the <HI>Epocha,</HI> mu&s;t happen at 3 a Clock in the Morn|ing at <HI>Siam.</HI> As the lunar month of this method agrees to near a Second with the lunary month e&s;tabli&s;hed by all the <HI>European</HI> A&s;tronomers, it may be &s;up|po&s;ed that this hour of the new Moon of the <HI>Epocha</HI> is very preci&s;e, &s;ince it may have been deduced from the Ob&s;ervations of the Eclip&s;es of the Moon, which are much more ea&s;ie to determine than all the other <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the Planets. We may therefore make u&s;e of the common Tables to &s;eek the new Moons which happen'd about the &s;eventh Age at three in the morning in the meridian of <HI>Siam,</HI> the difference of which from the meridian of <HI>Paris</HI> is very exactly known to us by &s;everal ob&s;ervations of the Eclip&s;es of the Moon, and the <HI>Satellites</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> &s;ent by the King into the Ea&s;t in qua|lity of his Maje&s;tie's Mathematicians have made at <HI>Siam,</HI> and by the Ob&s;erva|tions of the &s;ame Eclip&s;es made at the &s;ame time at <HI>Paris</HI> in the Royal Ob&s;er|vatory; by the Compari&s;on of which Ob&s;ervations it is found that the diffe|rence of the meridians of the&s;e two Cities is 6 hours 34 minutes.</P>
<P>To this Character of time we might add the Circum&s;tance of the middle Aequinox of the Spring, which according to the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the IV. Section, mu&s;t happen at 11 hours 11 minutes after the midnight which followed the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun taken for the <HI>Epocha,</HI> according to what has been &s;aid on the 5^t^h Article of the IV. Section, where they deduct 373/800 of a day, that is to &s;ay, 11 hours and 11 minutes from the days elap&s;ed &s;ince the <HI>Epocha,</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes as much as the <HI>Krommethiapponne,</HI> which we have declared to be the time elap&s;ed from the Suns return to the the point of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> from whence is taken the motion of the Sun and Moon, which mu&s;t be the Aequinoxial point of the Spring.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t not be pretended that the modern Tables do give the very hour of this Aequinox: for they do not exactly agree together in the Aequinoxes, by rea&s;on of the great difficulty which is found to determine them preci&s;ely. They agree not with the antient Tables of <HI>Ptolomy</HI> in the middle Aequinoxes, to near 3 or 4 days: wherefore it is &s;ufficient that we found by the modern Tables a new Moon to happen at <HI>Siam</HI> at 3 a Clock in the morning, within a day or two of the middle Aequinox of the Spring found by the modern Tables.</P>
<P>The place of the Suns <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> which according to what we have drawn from the Rules of the 2^d and 3^d Articles of the VIII. Section, was at the time of the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> in the 20^t^h degree of the &s;ign <HI>Gemini,</HI> denotes the Age wherein it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;eek this new Aequinoxial Moon, which accor|ding to the modern Tables, was about the &s;eventh after the Nativity of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It is true that as the&s;e Rules give not motion to the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> it may be doubted, whether it was not in this degree at the time of the <HI>Epocha,</HI> or at the time of the Ob&s;ervations upon which the&s;e Rules have been made. But the Age of this <HI>Epocha</HI> is likewi&s;e determined by another Character joyned to the former: 'Tis the place of the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> which according to what we have drawn from the 2^d and 3^d Articles of the VI. Section, was at the time of the <HI>Epocha</HI> in the 20^t^h degree of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and to which the&s;e Rules do give

a motion conformable to that which our Tables do give it; altho they agree not together in the <HI>Epoches</HI> of the <HI>Apogaea,</HI> but to one or two degrees.</P>
<P>In fine, the day of the Week mu&s;t be a Saturday in the <HI>Epocha,</HI> &s;eeing that ac|cording to the 3^d Section, the fir&s;t day after the <HI>Epocha</HI> was a Sunday; and this circum&s;tance joyned to what has been &s;aid, that the &s;ame day was near the Equi|nox, gives the la&s;t determination to the <HI>Epocha.</HI></P>
<P>We have therefore &s;ought a new Equinoxial Moon, to which all the&s;e Cha|racters do agree; and we have found that they agree to the New Moon, which happened in the 638^t^h year after the Birth of <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> on the 21 of <HI>March,</HI> according to the <HI>Julian</HI> form, on Saturday at 3 a Clock in the morning, in the Meridian of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>This middle conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, according to the <HI>Rudol|phine</HI> Tables which are now mo&s;t u&s;ed, happen'd on this day at <HI>Siam</HI> on the very &s;ame hour, the reduction of the meridians being made according to our Ob&s;ervations: And according to the&s;e Tables 'twas 16 hours after the middle Aequinox of the Spring; the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> being at 19 degrees &frac14; of <HI>Gemini;</HI> the Moon's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> 21 degrees &frac12; of <HI>Capricorn;</HI> and the Node de&s;cending from the Moon at 4 degrees of <HI>Aries:</HI> &s;o that this Aequinoxial Conjunction had al&s;o this in particular, that it was Ecliptick, being arrived at &s;o little di&s;tance from one of the Nodes of the Moon.</P>
<P>This A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> being thus determined by &s;o many Characters, which cannot agree to any other time, by the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Rules are found the middle Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun about the time of this <HI>Epocha,</HI> with as much exactne&s;s as by the modern Tables, among&s;t which the&s;e are &s;ome which for this time do give the &s;ame middle di&s;tance between the Sun and the Moon, to one or two minutes, the Reduction being made to the &s;ame meridian.</P>
<P>But from this <HI>Epocha,</HI> as they remove from it, the middle di&s;tances from the Moon to the Sun found by the&s;e Rules, do by one minute in twelve years &s;ur|pa&s;s tho&s;e which the modern Tables do give, as we have before remarked: from whence it may be inferred that if the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Rules, at the time that they were made, gave the middle di&s;tances from the Moon to the Sun more exact than they have given them &s;ince, they have been made very near the time of the <HI>Epocha</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed by the&s;e Rules. Yet they might be e&s;tabli&s;hed a long time after, on &s;ome Ob&s;ervations made very near the time of the <HI>Epo|cha,</HI> thus they would more exactly repre&s;ent the&s;e Ob&s;ervations than tho&s;e of the other times remote from the <HI>Epocha:</HI> as it ordinarily happens to all the A&s;tronomical Tables, which do more exactly repre&s;ent the Ob&s;ervations upon which they are founded, than the others made long before and after.</P>

The full Moon happened not till the day following; and the lunary month which then ran, was the third after the Vernal Equinox; the fir&s;t after this Equinox beginning the 12^t^h of <HI>April</HI> in the &s;ame year, therefore the fir&s;t month from the Equinox was the &s;ixth month of the Civil year, which mu&s;t begin the 15^t^h of <HI>November,</HI> 1686.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o that the &s;ame year was Leap-year of 13 months, and that there was one which is not put in the number of the others: for the 20^t^h of <HI>October</HI> in the &s;ame year they reckon'd <HI>the fifteenth day of the eleventh Moon of the year</HI> 2231, and between the full Moon of <HI>June</HI> and that of <HI>October</HI> there were 4 lunar months. Neverthele&s;s they reckoned only three, &s;eeing that at the full Moon in <HI>June</HI> they reckon'd the eighth month, and at that of <HI>October</HI> they reckon'd on|ly the eleventh; there was therefore in this interval of time a Leap-month which is not reckon'd. This Intercalation is likewi&s;e found by comparing the Letter from the Amba&s;&s;adors with three of the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Letters, of <HI>De|cember</HI> 22 of the year 1687, recited by Father <HI>Tachardin,</HI> page 282, 287, and 407, which are dated <HI>the</HI> 3d <HI>of the decrea&s;e of the fir&s;t Moon of the year</HI> 2231: and it ap|pears that if the Moon of <HI>June</HI> was the eighth Moon of the Civil year 2231, that of <HI>December</HI> was the fourteenth of the &s;ame Civil year, which is reckon'd for the fir&s;t Moon of the &s;ucceeding years, tho the year be yet named 2231, where|as according to the preceding dates, it ought to be named 2232.</P>
<P>Perhaps they chang'd not the name of the Civil year, till it was &s;ufficiently advanced, and had attained the beginning of the A&s;tronomical year: or rather unto this time they do name it after two ways, For another date which Mr. <HI>de la Loubere</HI> communicated unto me, is thus, <HI>the eighth of the encrea&s;e of the fir&s;t Moon of the Year</HI> 223&frac12;. 2. which <HI>is the eleventh of December</HI> 1687. It &s;eems that this manner of date denotes that the year may in this month be named either 2231, or 2232: which has relation to the form now u&s;ed in the Northern Countries, where the dates are frequently &s;et down in two ways, <HI>viz.</HI> according to the <HI>Julian,</HI> and according to the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Calendar; and to the ten fir&s;t days of the <HI>Gregorian</HI> year, is &s;et a Year more than in the <HI>Julian.</HI></P>
<P>By comparing the date of <HI>October</HI> 20^t^h which &s;uppo&s;es that the fir&s;t of the Moon was the 6^t^h of this month (which day was al&s;o that of the new Moon) with the other date of <HI>December</HI> the eleventh, which &s;uppo&s;es that the fir&s;t of the Moon was the 4^t^h of this month, there are found 59 days in two months, as the motion of the Moon requires. According to the&s;e dates the 22^d of <HI>December</HI> mu&s;t be the 19^t^h of the Moon, that is to &s;ay, the fourth day of the decrea&s;e, which in the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Letters is &s;et down the 3^d of the de|crea&s;e, the full of the Moon being &s;uppo&s;ed on the 15^t^h which &s;hould denote the Intercalation of a daymade to the full of the Moon, unle&s;s Letters &s;hould be antedated one day, or that there is one day wanting in the re&s;emblance which is made thereof to our Calendar.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the preceeding dates, and &s;ome others which we have examined, there are only tho&s;e of <HI>October</HI> 20^t^h and <HI>December</HI> 11^t^h that agree well together, and with the motion of the Moon, and in which they take the very day of the Moon's Conjunction with the Sun by the fir&s;t day of the month. The other dates differ &s;ome days among them; for in tho&s;e of <HI>June</HI> 24^t^h they take for the fir&s;t day of the month a day which precedes the Conjunction; on the contrary in the dates of <HI>December</HI> 22^d they take for the fir&s;t day of the month a day which follows the Conjunction. Thus the dates which for the fir&s;t day of the Month do take the very day of the Conjunction, may be thought the mo&s;t regular. We have calculated the&s;e Conjunctions, not only by the modern Ta|bles, but al&s;o by the <HI>Indian</HI> Rules, after the manner as we &s;hall herein after de|clare, and we have found that they agree together in the &s;ame days of the year.</P>

But the <HI>Indians</HI> have avoided this fault; by making u&s;e of the Rules of the I. Section to find the number of the lunar months; and of the Rules of the II. Section, to find the number of the days and hours which are in this number of months; which being founded on the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the greatne&s;s of the lunar months, which differs not from the real one, a &s;econd cannot want above a day in 8000 years; whereas the Ancient Cycle of our golden number &s;uppo&s;es that in 235 lunar months there are the number of days and hours which are in 19 <HI>Julian</HI> years, which do exceed 235 lunar months one hour 27&prime;; 33&Prime;, which do make 5 days in 1563 years.</P>
<P>It appears al&s;o that the Calendar of the <HI>Indians</HI> is very different from that of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who begin their year with the new Moon neare&s;t the fifteenth of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> according to Father <HI>Martinius;</HI> or the fifth of the &s;ame Sign, accord|ing to Father <HI>Couplet</HI> (which happen'd but a month and half, before the Vernal Equinox, and who regulate their Intercalations by a Cycle of &s;ixty years; which the <HI>Tunquine&s;es</HI> do likewi&s;e, according to the report of Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his Relations.</P>

<P>By this means we have determined in our Calendar the Terms between which the new Moon mu&s;t happen, from whence it is nece&s;&s;ary to begin to compute the months of the year current, according to the 4th <HI>Article</HI> of the I.

<P>We have likewi&s;e found that the&s;e Terms in the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Calendar, do ad|vance a day in 239 years, and do go back a day in the <HI>Julian</HI> Calendar in 302 years; which it is nece&s;&s;ary to know, to be able to make u&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> Rules among&s;t us.</P>
<P>To determine in the&s;e Calendars the Terms between which the new Moon mu&s;t happen, from whence the Civil year of the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> ought to begin ac|cording to the&s;e Rules, it is nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a Sy&s;tem of common and Bi&s;&s;extile years well dige&s;ted in the Cycle of 19 years, which Sy&s;tem &s;hould be &s;uch, that the fifth month of the fir&s;t year after the Bi&s;&s;extile, and the &s;ixth month of the other years, do begin in this Age between <HI>March</HI> 28th, and <HI>April</HI> 27^t^h of the <HI>Gregorian</HI> year.</P>
<P>According to this Rule, the Civil year &s;hould begin in this Age before the 12th of <HI>December.</HI> For if it begins the 12th the year following, which would begin, <HI>December</HI> 1. would be after the common year, and according to the Rule

<P>We find likewi&s;e by our Calculations, that according to the&s;e very Rules, the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> year &s;hould begin on the 12th of <HI>December</HI> in the <HI>Gregorian</HI> year 1700, which will not be Bi&s;&s;extile.

Thus the new Moon, which will happen the Age following between the 12^t^h of <HI>November,</HI> and the 12th of <HI>December,</HI> will be that from whence according to the&s;e Rules the Civil year of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> ought to begin.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s we have lately &s;een a date of the fir&s;t of <HI>January</HI> 1684, where|in it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the beginning of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> year was at the new Moon, which happen'd the 18th of <HI>December</HI> 1683. This date being compared with tho&s;e of the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Siam,</HI> wherein it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the beginning of the year 2231, was at the new Moon, which happen'd the 16th of <HI>November</HI> 1686, would &s;hew that the Terms of the fir&s;t month of the <HI>Siame&s;e</HI> year, ac|cording to the u&s;age of the&s;e times, are at lea&s;t 32 days di&s;tant from each other, altho' according to the Rules, they ought not to be more than a lunary month, or thirty days di&s;tant.</P>
<P>This confirms what we have already remark'd, that in this Age they conform not exactly to the&s;e Rules in the dates, altho' they differ not much therefrom.

<P>The <HI>Aera</HI> is &s;poken of in the I.

Section, which, as we have remarked, approaches the A&s;tral year determined by the re|turn of the Sun to a fixed Star, and the Anomali&s;tick determined by the Sun's return to its <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> which &s;everal ancient and modern A&s;tronomers di&s;tin|gui&s;h not from the A&s;tral, no more than the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that the Sun's <HI>Apogaeum</HI> is fixed among&s;t the fixed Stars, tho' mo&s;t of the moderns do attribute a little motion to it.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, it appears that the <HI>Indians</HI> make u&s;e of the Solar year of the IV. Section, as we make u&s;e of the Tropick, when according to the Rules of the VII, VIII, X and XI. Sections, they calculated the place of the Sun and his <HI>Apogaeum,</HI> and of the Moon and her <HI>Apogaeum.</HI> For the time elap&s;ed from the end of this year called <HI>Krommethiapponne,</HI> &s;erves them to find the Signs, Degrees and Minutes of the middle motion of the Sun. They &s;uppo&s;e then that this year con&s;i&s;ts in the Sun's return to the beginning of the Signs of the Zodiack like our Tropical year.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that at pre&s;ent the Signs of the Zodiack are taken among&s;t us in two ways, which were not formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed. When the Ancients had ob&s;erved the tract of the Sun's motion thro' the Zodiack, which they had divi|ded into four equal parts by the points of the Aequinoxes and Sol&s;tices; and that they had &s;ubdivided every fourth part into three equal parts, which in all do make the 12 Signs, they ob&s;erved the Con&s;tellations formed of a great num|ber of fixed Stars, which fell in every one of the&s;e Signs, and they gave to the Signs the name of the Con&s;tellations which are there found, not &s;uppo&s;ing then that the &s;ame fixed Stars would ever quit their Signs.</P>
<P>But in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ages, it is found that the &s;ame fixed Stars were no more in the &s;ame degrees of the Signs, whether that the Stars were advanced towards the Ea&s;t in regard of the points of the Aequinoxes and Sol&s;tices, or that the&s;e very points were removed from the &s;ame fixed Stars towards the We&s;t; and it is now found that a fixed Star pa&s;&s;es from the beginning of one Sign to the beginning of another in about 2200 years.</P>
<P>Therefore &s;eeing that <HI>Ptolomy</HI> in the &s;econd Age of <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> confirmed this as yet doubtful di&s;covery, which had been made three Ages before by <HI>Hip|parchus;</HI> there is a di&s;tinction made between the Zodiack, which may be cal|led local, which begins from the Aequinoxial point of the Spring, and is divided into 12 Signs, and the A&s;tral Zodiack compo&s;ed of 12 Con&s;tellations, which do &s;till retain the &s;ame name, tho' at pre&s;ent the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Aries</HI> has pa&s;&s;ed into the Sign of <HI>Taurus,</HI> and that the &s;ame thing has happen'd to the other Con|&s;tellations which have pa&s;&s;ed into the following Signs.</P>
<P>Yet the A&s;tronomers do ordinarily refer the places and motions of the Pla|nets to the local Zodiack, becau&s;e it is important to know how they refer to the Aequinoxes and Sol&s;tices, on which depends their di&s;tance from the Aequinoxial and Poles, the various magnitude of the Days and Nights, the diver&s;ity of the Sea&s;ons, and &s;ome other Circum&s;tances, the knowledg of which is of great u&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Copernicus</HI> is almo&s;t the &s;ole per&s;on among&s;t our A&s;tronomers, who refers the places and motions of the Planets to the A&s;tral Zodiack, by rea&s;on that he &s;up|po&s;es
<PB N="209" REF="119">
that the fixed Stars are immoveable, and that the Anticipation of the Aequinoxes and Sol&s;tices, is only an appearance cau&s;ed by a certain motion of the <HI>Axis</HI> of the Earth. But they who follow his <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> cea&s;e not to denote the places of the Planets, in regard of the points of the Aequinoxes in the lo|cal Zodiack, by rea&s;on of the Con&s;equences of this Situation which we have remarked.</P>
<P>'Twould be an admirable thing that the <HI>Indians</HI> who follow the <HI>Dogmata</HI> of the <HI>Pythagoraeans,</HI> &s;hould herein conform to the method of <HI>Copernicus,</HI> who is the re&s;torer of the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the <HI>Pythagoraeans.</HI></P>
<P>Yet there is no appearance that they de&s;igned to refer the places of the Pla|nets rather to any fixed Star, than to the Aequinoxial point of the Spring. For it &s;eems that they would have cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e &s;ome principal fixed Star, as <HI>Copernicus</HI> has done, who, for the Principle of his Zodiack, has cho&s;en the Point to which refers the Longitude of the fir&s;t Star of <HI>Aries,</HI> which was found in the fir&s;t degree of <HI>Aries,</HI> where was the Aequinoxial Point of the Spring, when the A&s;tronomers began to place the fix'd Stars in regard of the Points of the Aequinoxes and Sol&s;tices.</P>
<P>But at the place of the Heavens, where the <HI>Indians</HI> place the beginning of the Signs of the Zodiack according to the IV. Section, and the following Sections, there is not any con&s;iderable Star; there are only thereabouts &s;ome of the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t ob&s;cure Stars of the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> but it is the place where was the Aequinoxial Point at the time of their A&s;tronomical <HI>Epo|cha,</HI> from whence the fixed Stars advanced afterwards towards the Ea&s;t; &s;o that the Sun, by its annual motion, returns not to the &s;ame fixed Star till about 20 minutes after its return to the &s;ame Point of the local Zodiack. It was dif|ficult to perceive this little difference in few years to the Ancients, who did not immediately compare the Sun to the fixed Stars, as it is at pre&s;ent compared, and who compared only the Sun to the Moon during the day, and the Moon to the fixed Stars during the night, tho' from the day to the night the Moon changes place among&s;t the fixt Stars, as well by its own motion, which is quick and ir|regular, as by its <HI>Parallax,</HI> which was not well known to the Ancients. Where|fore they very lately only perceived the difference that there is between the Tropical year, during which the Sun returns to the Points of the Aequinoxes and the Sol&s;tices, and the A&s;tral year during which it returns to the &s;ame fixed Stars; and then they had a Solar year of 365 days and a quarter, which is found at pre&s;ent to be the mean between the Tropical and the A&s;tral, and that it &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es the Tropical by 11 minutes, and is &s;horter than the A&s;tral by 9 mi|nutes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> The Determination of the Magnitude of the two &s;orts of <HI>Indian</HI> Years.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ea&s;ie to find the greatne&s;s of the year which is &s;uppo&s;ed in the IV. Secti|on, by dividing 292207 days by 800 years, each of which is found to con|&s;i&s;t of 365 days, 6 hours, 12&prime;, 36&Prime;.</P>
<P>It is a little more difficult to find that which re&s;ults from the I. and II. Secti|ons, in which it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply &s;ome Rules which are there wanting, to be able to make this u&s;e thereof. For in the I. Section it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the years are compo&s;ed of entire lunar months, and that the number of the months which remain, is known be&s;ides: And in the II. Section it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the entire months have been found by the I. Section, and that the number of the days which remain, is known be&s;ides: yet a number of &s;olar years, which is not but very rarely compo&s;ed of entire lunar months, mu&s;t have not only the number of the months, but al&s;o the number of the days determin'd. Indeed, we find that the&s;e Rules do tacitly &s;uppo&s;e a &s;olar year compo&s;ed of months, days, hours and minutes, which regulate the luni&s;olar years.</P>
<P>The way of finding it by the&s;e Rules, is to re&s;olve a year into &s;olar and lunar months, by the 3^d, 5^t^h, 6^t^h and 7^t^h Rules of the I. Section, and not to neglect the
<PB N="210" REF="120">
fraction which remains after the divi&s;ion made by the 6^t^h Article of the &s;ame Section; but to reduce it into days, hours, minutes and &s;econds, or into the decimal parts of a month, going to a thou&s;and millions, to prepare it for the operations which mu&s;t be performed according to the 1^&s;^t, 2^d, 3^d, 4^t^h, 6^t^h and 8^t^h rules of the II. Section, as well for this fraction, as for the whole months; and in fine, to reduce after the &s;ame manner the fraction called <HI>Anamaan</HI> in the II. Section.</P>
<P>After a plainer manner may likewi&s;e be found the greatne&s;s of this year, by making u&s;e of the <HI>Hypothe&s;es,</HI> which we have infolded in the&s;e two Sections, to find a period of years, which &s;hould be compo&s;ed of a number of intire lunar months, and likewi&s;e of a number of intire days.</P>
<P>By &s;uppo&s;ing, according to our explication of the <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> of the II. Section, that a lunar month is equal to 30 artificial days, and that 703 artificial days are equal to 692 natural days, it will be found that in 703 lunar months there are 20760<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> natural days; and adding thereunto the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the I. Section, ac|cording to which the number of 228 &s;olar months which do make 19 years) are equal to 235 lunar months, it will be found that in 13357 &s;olar years there are 165205 entire lunar months, which do make 4878600 natural days, from whence it re&s;ults that a lunar month, according to the&s;e <HI>Hypothe&s;es,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of 29 days, 12 hours, 44&prime;, 2&Prime;, 23&tprime;, 23&Prime;&Prime;, and the &s;olar year of 365 days, 5 hours, 55&prime;, 13&Prime;, 46&tprime;, 5&Prime;&Prime;.</P>
<P>This <HI>Indian</HI> year conceal'd in the tacit <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> of the&s;e two Sections, agrees within two &s;econds with the tropical year of <HI>Hipparchus</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> which con|&s;i&s;ts of 365 days, 5 hours, 55&prime;, 12&Prime;; and to near 13 &s;econds with that of <HI>Rabbi Adda</HI> an Author of the third Age, which con&s;i&s;ts of 365 days, 5 hours, 55&prime;, 26&Prime;. If it could be verified that the&s;e years and the&s;e months, had been determined by the <HI>Indians</HI> on the Ob&s;ervations of the Sun, independently from the We&s;tern A&s;tronomy, this agreemet of &s;everal A&s;tronomers, of different Nations, &s;o re|mote one from the other, would &s;erve to prove that the Tropical year has an|ciently been of this bigne&s;s, though at pre&s;ent it is found le&s;&s;er by 6 minutes, which in 10 years do make an hour, and in 240 years a whole day. But it is probable that this greatne&s;s of the year has been determined only by the Ob&s;er|vations of the Eclip&s;es and other Moons, and by the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> that Nineteen &s;olar years are equal to Two hundred thirty five lunar months; which <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> &s;o nearly approaches the truth, that it was difficult to ob&s;erve the difference there|of, but in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ages; which prevented <HI>Hipparacus</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy</HI> from departing therefrom in the determination of the greatne&s;s of the &s;olar year.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VIII.</HI> The Antiquity of the&s;e two &s;orts of <HI>Indian</HI> years.</HEAD>
<P>WE have not a more preci&s;e knowledge of the <HI>Indian</HI> years, than that which we have drawn from the&s;e Rules. <HI>Scaliger</HI> who has carefully collected all the Memoirs that he could gather from the ancient Authors, from the Patriarch of <HI>Antioch,</HI> from the Mi&s;&s;ionaries, and different Travellers, and who has in&s;erted them, not only in his work <HI>de Emendatione temporum,</HI> but al&s;o in his Commentaries upon <HI>Manilius,</HI> and in his <HI>I&s;agoge Chronologica,</HI> judging that the&s;e Memoirs might plea&s;e all tho&s;e that have any curio&s;ity for Learning, e&s;ta|bli&s;hes nothing thereon which &s;atisfies <HI>Patavius;</HI> and it is certain, that <HI>Scaliger</HI>'s <HI>Indian</HI> year refers neither to the one nor the other of tho&s;e which we have now found.</P>
<P>But in the Cardinal <HI>de Cu&s;a</HI>'s Treati&s;e of the Calendar, there are &s;ome <HI>ve&s;ti|gia</HI> of the&s;e two &s;orts of <HI>Indian</HI> years. That which we have drawn from the IV. Section, is there found almo&s;t in formal terms; that which we have drawn from the Compari&s;on of the I. and II. Section is found there al&s;o, but after a man|ner &s;o ob&s;cure, that the Author him&s;elf who relates it has not comprehend|ed it.</P>
<P>This Cardinal &s;ays, that according to <HI>Abraham Aven Ezra,</HI> an A&s;tronomer of the Twelfth Age, the <HI>Indians</HI> do add (to the year of 365 days) the fourth
<PB N="211" REF="120">
part of a day, and the fifth part of an hour, when they &s;peak of the year in which the Sun returns to the &s;ame Star. This year con&s;i&s;ts then of 365 days, 6 hours, and 12&prime;; and it agrees to near 36 &s;econds with the year that we found by the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the IV. Section. This Author adds, that they who &s;peak of the year according to which the <HI>Indians</HI> do regulate their Fea&s;ts, do alledge that from the fourth part there re&s;ults a day more in 320 years. <HI>Ex quarta plus</HI> 320 <HI>annis diem exurgere:</HI> which he explains after a manner which cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t. <HI>This year,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>is greater than our common year, by one fourth,</HI> 23 <HI>&s;econds, and</HI> 30 <HI>thirds, which in</HI> 353 <HI>years do make a day.</HI> The means of drawing a rea&s;onable &s;en&s;e from this explication is not evident. For a day divided in three hundred fifty three years gives to each year 4 minutes, 4&Prime;, 45&tprime;; and not 23&Prime;, 30&tprime;. The true &s;en&s;e of the&s;e words, <HI>Ex quarta plus</HI> 320 <HI>annis diem exurgere,</HI> is in my opinion, that 320 years of 365 days and a quarter, do by one whole day &s;ur|pa&s;s 320 of the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> years. One day divided in 320 years, gives to each 4 minutes, 30 &s;econds; which being deducted from 365 and a quarter, do leave 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes, and 30 &s;econds; which will be the greatne&s;s of the year, which regulates the <HI>Indian</HI> Fea&s;ts. This year exceeds not but by 16 &s;econds, the greatne&s;s of the year, which we have found by the compari&s;on of the <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> of the I. and II. Section of the <HI>Indian</HI> Rules: wherefore there is no rea&s;on to doubt but it is this which is here treated of.</P>

<HEAD><HI>IX.</HI> The <HI>Epocha</HI> of the Synodical &s;olar years of the <HI>Indians</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis &s;ort of &s;olar years, drawn from the rules of the two fir&s;t Sections, may be called Synodical, becau&s;e that it re&s;ults from the Equality which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be between 19 of the&s;e &s;olar years, and 235 lunar months, which terminate at the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. For the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the&s;e years may be taken the day and hour of the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. which happen'd the very day of the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha,</HI> to near a day of the middle Equinox of the Spring; tho &s;ome may infer from the 5^t^h, 6^t^h, and 8^t^h Articles of the II. Section, that for the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the&s;e years they take the minute which immediately follows this middle Conjuncti|on, at the Meridian to which the rules of this Section were accommodated. Thus in particular calculations, there will be no more need of the Operation pre&s;cribed in the 5^t^h Article of the II. Section, which is founded on the diffe|rence which was between the in&s;tant of this middle Conjunction and the mid|night following, at a particular Meridian more occidental than <HI>Siam;</HI> nor of the Operations pre&s;cribed in the 8^t^h Article of the VII. Section, and at the 9^t^h Ar|ticle of the X. Section, which we have judged to denote the minutes of the motion of the Sun and Moon, between the Meridian of <HI>Siam,</HI> and the Meridian to which the rules of the II. Section had been accommodated; and it will &s;uf|fice to have had regard to the&s;e three Articles once for all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Epocha</HI> of the&s;e Synodical years will therefore be the 21^&s;^t of <HI>March</HI> in the 638^t^h year of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> at 3 a clock, 2 minutes in the morning at the Meridian of <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>The greatne&s;s of the&s;e years, according to the VII. Chapter of the&s;e Re|flexions, con&s;i&s;ting of 365 days, 5 hours, 55&prime;, 13&Prime;, 46&tprime;, 5&Prime;&Prime;, we &s;hall find the beginning of the following years in the <HI>Julian</HI> years, by the continual addi|tion of 5 hours, 55&prime;, 13&Prime;, 46&tprime;, 5&Prime;&Prime;, deducting a day from the &s;umm of the days which re&s;ults from this addition in the Bi&s;&s;extile years; thus we &s;hall find the beginnings of the&s;e &s;olar Synodical years, the dates of which we have exa|min'd as we have here calculated them, at the Meridian of <HI>Siam</HI> with the hours computed after midnight.</P>

<P><PB N="213" REF="121">For every nineteenth &s;olar &s;ynodical year from the <HI>Epocha</HI> ends with the mid|dle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, from whence begins the twentieth year. The greatne&s;s of this period is found by re&s;olving 19 years into lunar months by the 3^d, 5^t^h, 6^t^h and 7^t^h Articles of the I Section, and by re&s;olving the lunar months into days by the 2^d, 4^t^h, 6^t^h and 8^t^h Articles of the II Secti|on; and in fine, by reducing the fraction of the days called <HI>Anamaan,</HI> into hours, minutes, &s;econds and thirds: and by this means it will be found that the <HI>Indian</HI> pe|riod of 19 years, con&s;i&s;ts of 6939 days, 16 hours, 29 minutes, 21 &s;econds, 35 thirds.</P>
<P>Tho this <HI>Indian</HI> Period of 19 years agrees in the number of the lunar months, which it comprehends, with the periods of <HI>Numa, Meton,</HI> and <HI>Calippus,</HI> and with our Cycle of the Golden number, as we have remarked in the Expli|cation of the I. Section; yet it is different in the number of the hours.</P>
<P>That of <HI>Meto</HI> which contains 6940 days is longer by 7 hours, 30 minutes, 38 &s;econds, 25 thirds, than the <HI>Indian.</HI> That of <HI>Calippus</HI> and of our golden number which contain 6939 days and 18 hours, are longer by 1 hour, 30 minutes, 38 &s;econds, 25 thirds, than the <HI>Indian.</HI> That of <HI>Numa</HI> mu&s;t be of a number of whole days, according to <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> who&s;e words are the&s;e: <HI>Ad cur&s;um Lunae in duodecim men&s;es de&s;cribit annum, quem (quia tricenos dies &s;ingulis men&s;ibus Luna non explet, de&s;untque dies &s;olido anni, qui &s;olstitiali circumagitur orbe) intercalares men&s;ibus interponendo, ita di&s;pen&s;avit, ut vige&s;imo anno ad metam eandem &s;olis unde or&s;i e&s;&s;ent, plenis annorum &s;patiis dies congruerent.</HI> In all the Manu&s;cripts that we have &s;een, it is read <HI>vice&s;imo anno,</HI> and not <HI>vige&s;imo quarto&punc;</HI> as in &s;ome printed Copies.</P>
<P>The period of 19 years of the <HI>Indians</HI> is therefore more exact than the&s;e pe|riods of the Ancients, and than our golden Cycle; and it agrees to 3 minutes, and 5 or 6 &s;econds with the period of 235 lunar months e&s;tabli&s;hed by the mo|derns, which do make it of 6939 days, 16 hours, 13 minutes, 27 &s;econds.</P>
<P>This is the beginning of the current <HI>Indian</HI> period of 19 years, and of the re&s;t which follow for above an Age in the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Calendar, at the Meridian of <HI>Siam,</HI> with the hours after midnight.</P>

<P><PB N="214" REF="122">To the nineteenth year is added a thirteenth month, to make it Emboli&s;mic; thus the <HI>Epact</HI> at the end of the nineteenth year, is 0.</P>
<P>If the luni&s;olar years are ordered after this manner, they will always end be|fore the &s;ynodical Equinox, or in the Equinox it &s;elf. But they may be &s;o or|dered, that they end always after the &s;ynodical Equinox: which will happen, if when the <HI>Epact</HI> is 0, they begin them with the new Moon, which happens a month after the &s;ynodical Equinox: and after this manner the fir&s;t month of the A&s;tronomical year will commence at the beginning of the fifth month of the Civil year after the Emboli&s;me; whereas in the year of the fir&s;t method, the fir&s;t month would end at the beginning of the fifth month of the Civil year af|ter the Emboli&s;me.</P>
<P>This <HI>Indian Epact</HI> is a great deal more exact than our vulgar <HI>Epact,</HI> which augments 11 days by the year; &s;o that they deduct 30 days, when it exceeds this number, taking 30 days for a lunar month, and the nineteenth year they &s;ub&s;tract 29 days to reduce the <HI>Epocha</HI> to nothing at the end of the nineteenth luni&s;olar year.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Epact of a month, being reduced to hours, con&s;i&s;ts of 21 hours 45&prime;, 33&Prime;, 46&tprime;. The <HI>Epact</HI> of a year con&s;i&s;ts of 10 days, 21 hours, 6&prime;, 45&Prime;. The <HI>Epact</HI> of 3 years is 3 days, 2 hours, 36 minutes, 13 &s;econds. The <HI>Epact</HI> of 11 years which is the lea&s;t of all in the Cycle of 19 years, is 1 day, 13 hours, 18&prime;, 7&Prime;.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian Epact</HI> may be con&s;ider'd in re&s;pect of the <HI>Julian</HI> and <HI>Gregorian</HI> years: and it will &s;erve to find the beginning of the Civil and A&s;tronomical years of the <HI>Indians</HI> in our Calendar, after they &s;hall have e&s;tabli&s;hed an <HI>Epocha</HI> and denoted the Terms.</P>
<P>From a Common or Bi&s;&s;extile year, to the &s;ucceeding common, <HI>Julian</HI> or <HI>Gregorian</HI> year, the <HI>Indian Epact</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of 10 days, 15 hours, 11&prime;. 32&Prime;.</P>
<P>From a common year to the following Bi&s;&s;extile year, the <HI>Indian Epact</HI> is 11 days, 15 hours, 11&prime;, 32&Prime;.</P>
<P>The annual <HI>Epact</HI> mu&s;t be &s;ub&s;tracted from the fir&s;t new Moon of a year, to find the fir&s;t new Moon of the following year.</P>
<P>But when after the Sub&s;traction, the new Moon precedes the Term; they add a month to the year to make it Emboli&s;mic. Thus having &s;uppo&s;ed the fir&s;t new Moon after the &s;ynodical Equinox of the year 1683, as in Chapter IX, on the 25^t^h of <HI>April,</HI> 22 hours, and 41 minutes after noon, that is to &s;ay, on the 26th of <HI>April,</HI> at 10 a clock, 41 minutes of the morning in the Meridian of <HI>Siam:</HI> to have the fir&s;t new Moon of the following year 1684, which is Bi&s;&s;extile, they will &s;ub&s;tract from this time 11 days, 15 hours, 11 minutes, 32 &s;econds, and they will have the 14^t^h of <HI>April,</HI> at 19 hours, 29 minutes, 28 &s;econds of the year 1684: and to have the fir&s;t new Moon of the &s;olar &s;ynodi|cal year, of the year 1685, which is common, they will &s;ub&s;tract from the pre|ceding days, 10 days, 15 hours, 11 minutes 32 &s;econds; and they will have the 4^t^h of <HI>April</HI> at 4 hours, 17 minutes, 56 &s;econds.</P>
<P>In fine, to have the fir&s;t new Moon of the &s;olar &s;ynodical year of the follow|ing year 1686, which is common, deducting likewi&s;e the &s;ame number of days, they will have the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> at 13 hours, 6 minutes, 24 &s;econds. But becau&s;e that this day precedes the term of the &s;ynodical years, which for this Age hath been found the 27th of <HI>March;</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to add a lunar month of 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, 3 &s;econds; thus the year will be Emboli&s;mic of 13 Moons, and they will have the fir&s;t new Moon of the &s;ynodical <HI>Indian</HI> year the 23^d of <HI>April</HI> at 1 hour, 50 minutes, 27 &s;econds in the morning at <HI>Siam,</HI> and continuing after the &s;ame manner, they will have all the fir&s;t new Moons of the following years.</P>
<P>In the&s;e <HI>Indian</HI> rules the name of an Emboli&s;mick or <HI>Attikamaat,</HI> agrees to the year which immediately follows the Intercalation.</P>
<P>The luni&s;olar years may likewi&s;e be order'd in &s;uch a manner, that the addi|tion of the intercalary month may be made when the Epact exceeds 114/228, which do make the half of the month; to the end that the term might be as a medi|um between the &s;everal beginnings of the years, &s;ome of which commence &s;oon|er,
<PB N="215" REF="122">
and others later; as it is practi&s;ed in our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical years, which began before the Vernal Equinox, when the Equinox arrives before the 15^t^h of the Moon; and which begin after the Equinox, when the Equinox happens after the 14th of the Moon. But it is more commodious for the A&s;tronomical Cal|culations to begin the year always before, or always after the Equinox, as it is practi&s;ed in the A&s;tronomical <HI>Indian</HI> year, according to our Explication.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s it is nece&s;&s;ary to remark that the point of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> which the <HI>Indians</HI> do take for the beginning of the &s;igns, according to the Rules of the IV. and following Sections, and which they con&s;ider in &s;ome &s;ort as the Aequi|noxial point of the Spring, is in this Age removed 13 degrees from the A&s;tro|nomical Term of the years di&s;cour&s;ed of in the I. Section; &s;o that the Sun ar|rives there the fourteenth day after the &s;ynodical Aequinox. Wherefore a part of the A&s;tronomical luni&s;olar years which begin after the Term e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Rules of the I. Section, will begin in this Age before this &s;ort of Aequinox: and the other part will begin after; &s;o that this &s;ort of Aequinox is as it were in the middle of the &s;everal beginnings of the luni&s;olar years which begin in the fifth and &s;ixth month of the Civil year.</P>

<P>IT is very ea&s;y to accommodate the lunar months of the <HI>Indians</HI> and their &s;olar &s;ynodical years to the modern <HI>Hypothe&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>After having made the calculations according to the <HI>Indian</HI> Rules, it is nece&s;|&s;ary to divide the number of the years elap&s;ed &s;ince the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> by 6 and by 4. The fir&s;t Quotient will give a number of &s;econds to &s;ub&s;tract from the time of the new Moons calculated according to the&s;e Rules.</P>
<DIV4 TYPE="example">
<HEAD>EXAMPLE.</HEAD>
<P>In the year of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> 1688, the number of the years elap&s;ed from the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> is 1050. This number being divided by 6, the Quotient, which is 175, gives 175 minutes, that is to &s;ay 2 hours, 55 mi|nutes to add.</P>
<P>This &s;ame number being divided by 4, the quotient is 262, which gives 262 &s;econds, that is to &s;ay 6 minutes, 22 &s;econds to &s;ub&s;tract; and the Equation will be 2 hours, 48 minutes, 38 &s;econds. Having added this Equation to the fir&s;t Conjunction of the &s;olar Synodical year 1051, which, according to the&s;e rules, happen'd the 31&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> in the year 1688, at 19 hours, 28 mi|nutes, 24 &s;econds, after midnight; the middle Conjunction will be the 31&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> at 22 hours, 17 minutes, 12 &s;econds, at the Meridian of <HI>Siam.</HI> The &s;ame Equation &s;erves to the Synodical years which re&s;ult from the time of 235 lunar months divided into 19 years.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XIII.</HI> The difference between the &s;olar Synodical, and the Tropical years of the <HI>Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the <HI>Indians</HI> take for a Tropical year the time which the Sun employs in re|turning to the beginning of the Signs of the Zodiack, according to the fourth and following Sections; the difference between the&s;e years and the Synodical is con&s;iderable, as we have already remark'd. According to the We&s;tern A&s;tro|nomy, the beginning of the Signs is the point of the Vernal Equinox, where the a&s;cending demicircle of the Zodiack, terminated by the Tropicks, is inter|&s;ected
<PB N="216" REF="123">
by the Equinoxial; for they hold no more to the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the Anci|ents, who plac'd the Equinoxes at the eighth parts of the Signs: and the Tro|pical year is the time that the Sun employs in returning to the &s;ame point, whe|ther Equinoxial or Tropical.</P>
<P>The Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun, which happen in the points of the Equinoxes, return not preci&s;ely at the end of the nineteenth Tropical year: for this nineteenth year ends about two hours before the end of the 235^t^h lunar month, which terminates the nineteenth Synodical year.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, about two hours: for in this the modern A&s;tronomers agree not among them&s;elves to 9 or 10 minutes, becau&s;e that the time of the Equinoxes being very difficult to determine exactly, they agree not in the exactne&s;s of the Tro|pical year but to near half a minute; tho they be almo&s;t unanimou&s;ly agreed even to the thirds, in the greatne&s;s of the lunar month. Tho&s;e that do make the greatne&s;s of the Tropical year of 365 days, 5 hours, 49 minutes, 4 &s;econds, and 36 thirds, will have the period of 19 &s;olar Synodical years above two ex|act hours longer than the period of 19 Tropical years: They that make the Tropical year longer, will have a le&s;&s;er difference; and they that make the Tropical year &s;horter, as mo&s;t of the A&s;tronomers do at pre&s;ent, will have it greater. It may here be &s;uppo&s;ed that this difference would be 2 hours want|ting 3 minutes, &s;eeing that the defect of the lunar <HI>Indian</HI> months in 19 years is 3 minutes; and that the Tropical year would con&s;i&s;t of 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 55 &s;econds. Thus, if at every 19^t^h year from the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epo|cha</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> they deduct 2 hours from the Equinoxial Term, calculated by the <HI>Indian</HI> rules without the correction; and if they deduct al&s;o 14 hours 46 minutes for the time by which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the middle Equinox precedes the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the new Moons, according to the modern <HI>Hypothe&s;es;</HI> they will have the middle Equinox of the Spring of the year propo&s;ed &s;ince the <HI>Epocha,</HI> conformable to the modern <HI>Hypothe&s;es.</HI></P>
<DIV4 TYPE="example">
<HEAD>EXAMPLE.</HEAD>
<P>In the year 1686 the number of the years &s;ince the A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Indians</HI> is 1048. This number being divided by 19, the Quotient is 55 3/19, which being doubled gives 110 hours, 19 minutes, that is to &s;ay, 4 days, 14 hours, 19 minutes; to which having added for the <HI>Epocha</HI> 14 hours, 4 minutes, the &s;umm is 5 days, 5 hours, 5 minutes: and this &s;umm being deducted from the term of the &s;ame Synodical year 1048, which has before been found on the 27^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> 1686, at 15 hours, 42 minutes of the evening; there remains the 22^d of <HI>March,</HI> 10 hours, 37 minutes of the Evening, at the Meridian of <HI>Siam,</HI> for the middle Equinox of the Spring of the year 1686.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XIV.</HI> An Examination of the great luni&s;olar period of the <HI>Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the VII.

This Period according to the <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of the&s;e Rules, brings back the new Moons which terminate the <HI>Indian</HI> &s;ynodical years, to the &s;ame hour and to the &s;ame minute under the &s;ame Meridian.</P>
<P>But having examined it by the method of the XII.

<HEAD><HI>XV.</HI> The great luni&s;olar Equinoxial period, conformable to the preceding corrections.</HEAD>
<P>BUt in&s;tead of correcting the great period foregoing, it is more proper to find out a much &s;horter, which brings back the new Moons and the Equi|noxes to the &s;ame hour under the &s;ame Meridian, thereby to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ome A|&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI>'s more near, and to abridge the Calculations which are &s;o much the longer, as the <HI>Epocha</HI>'s are more di&s;tant from our time.</P>
<P>It is extreamly difficult, or rather it is impo&s;&s;ible to find &s;ome &s;hort and pre|ci&s;e periods, which conjunctly reduce the new Moons and the Equinoxes to the &s;ame Meridian. <HI>Vieta</HI> propo&s;es one for the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Calendar of 165580000 years, which comprehends 2047939047 lunar months.</P>
<P>It is not po&s;&s;ible to verifie the exactne&s;s of the&s;e periods by the compari&s;on of the Ob&s;ervations that we have, the anciente&s;t of which are only of 25 Ages; and the&s;e long periods &s;erve not our de&s;ign, which is to bring the <HI>Epocha</HI>'s nearer.</P>
<P>It is better to make u&s;e of the &s;horte&s;t, tho le&s;s exact periods, and to denote how they want of being exact according to the <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> which we follow.</P>
<P>By the rules of the fir&s;t Section, and by our additions, it is found that 1040 &s;ynodical <HI>Indian</HI> years do make 12863 lunar months, and 157851/1000000; and by the rules of the II. Section it is found that this number of 12863 months without the fraction makes 379851 days, 21 hours, 24 minutes, 19 &s;econds.</P>
<P>According to the correction made by the method of the XII.

<HEAD><HI>XIX.</HI> An Ancient A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Indians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the III. Chapter of the&s;e Reflexions we have remarked, that the <HI>Siame&s;es</HI> in their dates make u&s;e of an <HI>Epocha,</HI> which precedes the year of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> by 544 years, and that after the twelfth or thirteenth month of the years from this <HI>Epocha,</HI> which do now end in <HI>November</HI> or <HI>December,</HI> the fir&s;t month which fol|lows, and which mu&s;t be attributed to the following year, is yet attributed to the &s;ame year: which has given us ground to conjecture, that they attribute al&s;o to the &s;ame year, the other months to the beginning of the A&s;tronomical year, which begins at the Vernal Equinox. This conjecture has been confirm|ed by the report of Mr. <HI>de la Loubere,</HI> who likewi&s;e judges that this Ancient <HI>Epocha</HI> mu&s;t al&s;o be an A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha.</HI></P>
<P>The extraordinary manner of computing the fir&s;t and &s;econd month of the &s;ame year after the twelfth or thirteenth, may cau&s;e a belief that the fir&s;t month of the&s;e years, which begins at pre&s;ent in <HI>November</HI> or <HI>December,</HI> began anciently near the Vernal Equinox, and that in proce&s;s of time, the <HI>Indians,</HI> either thro negligence, or to make u&s;e of a Cycle too &s;hort, as would be that of 60 years which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do u&s;e, have &s;ometimes failed to add a thirteenth month to the year which ought to be Emboli&s;mick, whence it has happen'd that the fir&s;t month has run back into the winter; which having been perceived, the winter months, now called fir&s;t, &s;econd and third, have been attributed to the prece|ding year, which according to the ancient in&s;titution ought not to end but at Spring.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Indian</HI> year, which was called 2231, at the end of the year 1687 of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> ought not to end, according to the Ancient In&s;titution, till the Spring of the year 1688. Having &s;ub&s;tracted 1688 from 2231, there remains 543, which is the number of the compleat years from the ancient <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Indians,</HI> to the year of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> This <HI>Epocha</HI> appertains therefore to the cur|rent year 544 before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> according to the mo&s;t common way of com|puting.</P>
<P>In this year the middle conjunction of the Moon happened between the true Equinox, and the middle Equinox of the Spring, at 15 degrees di&s;tance from the North Node of the Moon, the 27^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> according to the <HI>Julian</HI> form, a <HI>Saturday,</HI> which is an A&s;tronomical <HI>Epocha</HI> almo&s;t like to that of the year 638, which has been cho&s;en, as more modern and more preci&s;e than the former.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e two <HI>Indian Epocha</HI>'s there is a period of 1181 years, which be|ing joyned to a period of 19 years, there are two periods of 600 years, which reduce the new Moons near the Equinoxes.</P>

<P>To equal the years of the &s;exagenary Cycle to the &s;ynodical years regulated according to the Cycle of 19 years, it would be nece&s;&s;ary that among 19 &s;exa|genary Cycles there were 17 of 742 lunar months, and 2 of 743; or rather it would be nece&s;&s;ary that after 9 Cycles of 742 months, which do make 740 years, the tenth Cycle following, which would be accompli&s;h'd in the year 600, was of 743 months.</P>

<P>It is unque&s;tionable that a great part of the Eclip&s;es, and of the other Con|junctions which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do give as ob&s;erved, cannot have happened at the times that they pretend, according to the Calendar regulated after the manner as it is at pre&s;ent, as we have found by the Calculation of a great number of the&s;e Eclip&s;es, and even by the &s;ole examination of the Intervals which are re|marked between the one and the other: for &s;everal of the&s;e Intervals are too long, or too &s;hort, to be po&s;&s;ibly determined by the Eclip&s;es, which do happen only when the Sun is near one of the Nodes of the Moon; where it could not po&s;&s;ibly return at the times denoted, if the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> years had been regulated in the pa&s;t ages, as they are at pre&s;ent.

<P>THE Interval between the two <HI>Epocha</HI>'s of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which is 1181 years, is a luni&s;olar period, which reduces the new Moons near the Equinox, and to the &s;ame day of the week.</P>
<P>This period is compo&s;ed of 61 periods of 29 years, which are longer than 1159 tropical years; and of two periods of 11 years, which are &s;horter than 22 tropical; the defect of the one, partly recompencing the exce&s;s of the others.</P>
<P>As the mixture of the luni&s;olar years, &s;ome longer, others &s;horter, than the tropical, does more or le&s;s recompence the defect of the one by the exce&s;s of the other, as far as the Incommen&s;urability which may be between the moti|ons
<PB N="221" REF="125">
of the Sun and Moon permits it: It makes the luni&s;olar periods &s;o much the more preci&s;e, as they reduce the new Moons nearer the places of the Zo|diack where they arrived at the beginning.</P>
<P>The Antients have fir&s;t made the tryal of the little periods, the mo&s;t famous of which has been that of 8 years, which has been in u&s;e not only among&s;t the ancient <HI>Greeks,</HI> but al&s;o among&s;t the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians; as it appears by the Cycle of St. <HI>Hippolytus,</HI> publi&s;hed at the beginning of the third Age.</P>
<P>This period, compo&s;ed of five ordinary and three Emboli&s;mick years, being found too long by a day and half, which in 20 periods do make above a month; they were obliged to retrench a month in the twentieth period. But after|wards the period of 8 years was joyned to another of eleven years, compo&s;ed of &s;even ordinary and four Emboli&s;mick, which is too &s;hort about a day and a half&punc; and thereof was made the period of 19 years, which was &s;uppo&s;ed at fir&s;t to be exact, tho it has &s;ince had occa&s;ion of amendment in the number of the days and hours which it comprehends. The correction of this period was the origine of the period of 76 years, compo&s;ed of 4 periods of 19 years, corrected by <HI>Callippus,</HI> and of the period of 304 years, compo&s;ed of 16 periods of 19 years, corrected by <HI>Hipparchus.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> had a period of 84 years, compo&s;ed of four periods of 19 years, and one of 8 years, which reduces the new Moons near the Aequinox on the &s;ame day of the week.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t famous period of tho&s;e which have been invented to reduce the new Moons to the &s;ame place of the Zodiack, and to the &s;ame day of the week, is the <HI>Victorian</HI> of 532 years, compo&s;ed of 28 periods of 19 years.</P>
<P>Yet the new Moon which &s;hould terminate this period, happen'd not till two days after the Sun's return to the &s;ame point of the Zodiack, and two other days before the &s;ame day of the week, to which the conjunction was arrived at the beginning of the period; and the&s;e defects are multiplied in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the times, according to the number of the&s;e periods. Neverthele&s;s, after that the defects of this period were known by every one, &s;everal famous Chro|nologers have not cea&s;ed to make u&s;e thereof, and they terminate it on the &s;ame day of the week and on the &s;ame day of the <HI>Julian</HI> year, which in this inter|val of time exceeds the &s;olar tropical year 4 whole days, and the luni&s;olar year &s;omewhat le&s;s than two days.</P>
<P>They do al&s;o multiply this period by the Cycle of 15 years, which is that of the Indictions, the origine of which is not more ancient than 13 Ages, to form the <HI>Julian</HI> period of 7980 years, of which they e&s;tabli&s;h the <HI>Epocha</HI> 4713 years before the common <HI>Epocha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Christ.</HI> They prefer this imaginary period, in which the errors of the <HI>Victorian</HI> period are multiplied 15 times, to the true luni&s;olar periods, and they do likewi&s;e prefer this Ideal <HI>Epocha</HI> which they &s;up|po&s;e more antient than the World, to the A&s;tronomical and Hi&s;torical <HI>Epocha</HI>'s: even &s;o far that they refer thereto the Hi&s;torical Acts of the antient times be|fore <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> and before <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> tho the Indictions were not as yet in u&s;e, that there was then no Calendar to which this period could &s;erve to regulate the days of the week, and that in fine the Cycle of 19 years extended to this time, demon&s;trates not the &s;tate of the Sun nor of the Moon; which are the three principal things for which the&s;e three Cycles which from the <HI>Julian</HI> period, have been invented. Wherefore it gives not &s;o exact an Idea of the ancient times, which were not regulated after this manner, as of tho&s;e of the thir|teen la&s;t Ages, which were regulated among&s;t us according to the <HI>Julian</HI> year.</P>
<P>But the luni&s;olar periods of 19 years, which in regard of the tropical years are &s;omewhat too long, being joyned to the periods of 11 years which are too &s;hort, do form other periods more preci&s;e than tho&s;e which compo&s;e them. Among the&s;e periods the fir&s;t of the mo&s;t preci&s;e are tho&s;e of 334, 353, and 372 years, the la&s;t of which is terminated al&s;o on the &s;ame day of the week; and might be placed in the &s;tead of the <HI>Victorian.</HI></P>

This number of the days of the Moon at the end of a year is the <HI>Epact</HI> of the following year. 'Tis found that after the correction of the fir&s;t year of the Cycle, the <HI>Epact</HI> is 1.

<P>They ob&s;erve al&s;o the Variation which the <HI>Epacts</HI> do make from Age to Age in the very years of the Ancient lunar Cycle, and they find that in 2500 <HI>Juli|an</HI> years they augment 8 days; which &s;uppo&s;es the lunar month of 29 days, 12 hours, 44&prime;, 3&Prime;, 10&tprime;, 41&Prime;&Prime;.</P>

<HEAD><HI>XXVII.</HI> A new luni&s;olar and Pa&s;chal Period.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;upply this defect, and to find the <HI>Gregorian Epacts</HI> for future Ages with|out Tables, we do make u&s;e of a luni&s;olar period of 1600 years, which has for <HI>Epocha</HI> the Equinoxial Conjunction of the year of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and which reduces the new Moons &s;ince the correction, to the &s;ame day of the <HI>Gregorian</HI> year, to the &s;ame day of the week, and almo&s;t to the &s;ame hour of the day, under the &s;ame Meridian. According to this period we give to each period of 400 years &s;ince <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> 9 days of Equinoxial <HI>Epact,</HI> by deducting 29 when it &s;urpa&s;&s;es this number: and we add 8 days to the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> &s;ince the correction, to have the Civil <HI>Gregorian Epact,</HI> by deducting 30, when the &s;umm &s;urpa&s;&s;es this number.</P>
<P>At every hundredth year, not Bi&s;&s;extile, we dimini&s;h the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> 5 days, in re&s;pect of the hundredth preceding, and we take every hundreth year for <HI>Epocha</HI> of 5 periods of 19 years, to find the Augmentation of the <HI>Epacts</HI> for an Age at every year of the Cycle, after the accu&s;tomed manner.</P>
<P>Thus, to have the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> of the year 1600, which is di&s;tant from the <HI>Epocha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Christ</HI> 4 periods of 400 years, multiplying 4 by 9 there is 36; from whence having deducted 29, there remains 7, the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> of the year 1600, which &s;hews that the middle Equinox of the year 1600 happen'd 7 days after the middle Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun: adding there|unto 8 days, there are 15, which is the Civil <HI>Gregorian Epact</HI> of the year 1600,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Expl. Cal. p. 420.</NOTE> as it is &s;et down in the Table of the Moveable <HI>Gregorian</HI> Fea&s;ts.</P>
<P>It is evident that the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> of the year 11600, which terminates this period, mu&s;t be 0. But to find it by the &s;ame method, &s;ince that the year 11600 is removed from the <HI>Epocha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> 29 periods of 400 years, mul|tiplying 29 by 9, and dividing the product by 29, the quotient is 9, and the re|mainder 0 for the Equinoxial period: Adding 8, there is the Civil <HI>Gregorian Epact</HI> of the year 11600, which will be 8, as <HI>Clavius</HI> had found it by the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Tables, in the 168^t^h page of the Explication of the Calendar; which demon|&s;trates the conformity of the <HI>Epacts</HI> of the future Ages, found by the means of this period, after a method &s;o ea&s;ie, with the <HI>Gregorian Epacts,</HI> found by the means of three Tables of the <HI>Gregorian</HI> Calendar.</P>
<P>If the hours and minutes of the&s;e Equinoxial <HI>Epacts</HI> in the 400 years are al&s;o demanded, thereunto &s;hall be always added 8 hours, and be&s;ides &frac13; and 1 1/10 of as many hours as there are whole days in the <HI>Epact,</HI> and a third of as many mi|nutes. Thus for the year 1600, who&s;e Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> is 7 days; one third of 7 hours is 2^h, 20&prime;; a tenth is 0^h, 42&prime;; a third of 7 minutes is 2&prime;: the &s;umm added to 7 days 8 hours, makes 7 days, 11^h, 4&prime;, the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> of the year 1600.</P>
<P>Deducting this <HI>Epact</HI> from the time of the middle Equinox, which in 1600 happened the 21 of <HI>March,</HI> at 20 hours after noon at <HI>Rome,</HI> the middle conjun|ction preceding will be on the 14^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> at 8^h, 56&prime;: adding thereunto half a lunar month, which is 14 days, 18^h, 22&prime;, the middle oppo&s;ition will be found on the 29^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> at 3^h, 18&prime;.

<P>To have by hours and minutes the Equinoxial <HI>Epact</HI> in the hundreds, not Bi&s;&s;extiles, from the <HI>Epact</HI> found in the preceding hundredth Bi&s;&s;extile, &s;hall be deducted 5 days, 2^h, 12&prime;, for the fir&s;t, double for the &s;econd, triple for the third (borrowing a month of 29 days, 12^h, 44&prime;, if it is required) and you will have the <HI>Epact</HI> in the hundred propo&s;ed, which &s;hall be made u&s;e of in the pre|ceding example, comparing it with the middle Equinox of the &s;ame year.</P>

<P>Note, <HI>That what is &s;aid at the beginning of Page</HI> 189, <HI>that in this extract the num|bers are written from the top to the bottom, after the manner of the</HI> Chine&s;es, <HI>must be understood, that they place the &s;um of the minutes under that of the degrees, that of the &s;econds under that of the minutes, that of the thirds under that of the &s;econds, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, as we place the &s;ums one under the other, when we would make the Addition thereof: but in every particular &s;um, whether of degrees, or minutes, &s;econds, thirds or others, the Cyphers are ranged in this extract according to our manner of ranging them.</HI></P>
<P>Note, <HI>Al&s;o, that the word</HI> Souriat, <HI>which is found Page</HI> 193 <HI>and el&s;ewhere, is the name of the Sun in the learned Language of</HI> Paliacata, <HI>and that the word</HI> aatit, <HI>which is found Page</HI> 195 <HI>is likewi&s;e the name of the Sun, but in the</HI> Balie <HI>Tongue, and al&s;o in the vulgar Language of</HI> Paliacata, <HI>as it has been before remarked in the Chapter of the Names of the days, of the months, and of the years.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Problem of the Magical Squares according to the <HI>In|dians.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis Problem is thus:</P>
<P>A &s;quare being divided into as many little equal &s;quares as &s;hall be de&s;ired, it is nece&s;&s;ary to fill the little &s;quares with as many numbers given in Arithmetical progre&s;&s;ion, in &s;uch a manner that the numbers of the little &s;quares of each rank, whether from top to bottom, or from right to left, and tho&s;e of the Di|agonals do always make the &s;ame &s;um.</P>
<P>Now to the end that a &s;quare might be divided into little equal &s;quares, it is nece&s;&s;ary that there are as many ranks of little &s;quares, as there &s;hall be little &s;quares to each rank.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="129">The little &s;quares I will call the <HI>ca&s;es,</HI> and the rows from top to bottom <HI>up|right,</HI> and tho&s;e from right to left <HI>tran&s;ver&s;e;</HI> and the word <HI>rank</HI> &s;hall equally de|note the upright and tran&s;ver&s;e.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that the Ca&s;es mu&s;t be filled with numbers in Arithmetical pro|gre&s;&s;ion, and becau&s;e that all Arithmetical Progre&s;&s;ion is indifferent for this Problem, I will take the natural for example, and will take the Unite for the fir&s;t number of the progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Behold then the two fir&s;t examples, <HI>viz.</HI> the &s;quare of nine Ca&s;es, and that of 16, filled, the one with the nine fir&s;t numbers from the unite to nine, and the other with the &s;ixteen fir&s;t numbers from the unite to 16: So that in the &s;quare of 9 Ca&s;es, the &s;umm of every upright, and that of every Tran&s;ver&s;e is 15, and that of each Diagonal 15 al&s;o: and that in that of 16 Ca&s;es, the &s;umm of every upright, and that of every Tran&s;ver&s;e is 34, and that of each Diago|nal 34 al&s;o.</P>

<P>This Problem is called Magical Squares, becau&s;e that <HI>Agrippa</HI> in his &s;econd Book <HI>De Occulta Philo&s;ophia,</HI> cap. 22. informs us that they were u&s;ed as Tali&s;|mans, after having engraved them on plates of diver&s;e metals: the cunning that there is in ranging the numbers after this manner, having appear'd &s;o marvel|lous to the ignorant, as to attribute the Invention thereof to Spirits &s;uperior to man. <HI>Agrippa</HI> has not only given the two preceding Squares, but five &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, which are tho&s;e of 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81 Ca&s;es; and he reports that the&s;e &s;even &s;quares were con&s;ecrated to the &s;even Planets. The Arithmeticians of the&s;e times have looked upon them as an Arithmetical &s;port, and not as my|&s;tery of Magic: And they have &s;ought out general methods to range them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that I know who laboured therein, was <HI>Ga&s;par Bachet de Meziriac,</HI> a Mathematician famous for his learned Commentaries on <HI>Diophantus.</HI> He found out an ingenious method for the unequal &s;quares, that is to &s;ay, for tho&s;e that have a number of unequal ca&s;es: but for the equal &s;quares he could find none. 'Tis in a Book in <HI>Octavo,</HI> which he has entituled, <HI>Plea&s;ant Problems by numbers.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Vincent,</HI> whom I have &s;o often mentioned in my Relation, &s;eeing me one day in the Ship, during our return, &s;tudiou&s;ly to range the Magical &s;quares after the manner of <HI>Bachet,</HI> informed me that the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Suratte</HI> ranged them with much more facility, and taught me their method for the unequal &s;quares only, having, he &s;aid, forgot that of the equal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;quare, which is that of 9 ca&s;es, return'd to the &s;quare of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> it was only &s;ubverted: but the other unequal &s;quares were e&s;&s;entially different from tho&s;e of <HI>Agrippa.</HI> He ranged the numbers in the ca&s;es immediately, and without he&s;itation; and I hope that it will not be unacceptable that I give the Rules, and the demon&s;tration of this method, which is &s;urprizing for its ex|tream facility to execute a thing, which has appeared difficult to all our Mathe|maticians.</P>
<P N="1">1. After having divided the total &s;quare into its little &s;quares, they place the numbers according to their natural order, I would &s;ay by beginning with the unite, and continuing with 2, 3, 4, and all the other numbers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and they place the unite, or the fir&s;t number of the Arithmetical Progre&s;&s;ion given, in the middle ca&s;e of the upper tran&s;ver&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. When they have put a number into the highe&s;t ca&s;e of an upright, they place the following number in the lowe&s;t ca&s;e of the upright, which follows
<PB N="229" REF="129">
towards the right: that is to &s;ay, that from the upper tran&s;ver&s;e they de&s;cend immediately to that below.</P>
<P N="3">3. When they have placed a number in the la&s;t ca&s;e of a tran&s;ver&s;e, the fol|lowing is put in the fir&s;t ca&s;e of the tran&s;ver&s;e immediately &s;uperior, that is to &s;ay, that from the la&s;t upright, they return immediately to the fir&s;t upright on the left.</P>
<P N="4">4. In every other occurrence, after having placed a number, they place the following in the ca&s;es which follow diametrically or &s;lantingly from the bottom to the top, and from the left to the right, until they come to one of the ca&s;es of the upper tran&s;ver&s;e, or of the la&s;t upright to the right.</P>
<P N="5">5. When they find the way &s;topp'd by any ca&s;e already filled with any num|ber, then they take the ca&s;e immediately under that which they have filled, and they continue it as before, diametrically from the bottom to the top, and from the left to the right.</P>
<P>The&s;e few Rules, ea&s;ie to retain, are &s;ufficient to range all the unequal &s;quares in general. An example renders them more intelligible.</P>

<P>This &s;quare is e&s;&s;entially different from that of <HI>Agrippa;</HI> and the method of <HI>Bachet</HI> is not ea&s;ily accommodated thereto; and on the contrary, the <HI>Indian</HI> me|thod may ea&s;ily give the &s;quares of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> by changing it in &s;omething.</P>
<P N="1">1. They place the unite in the Ca&s;e, which is immediately under that of the Center, and they pur&s;ue it diametrically from top to bottom, and from the left to the right.</P>
<P N="2">2. From the lowe&s;t ca&s;e of an upright, they pa&s;s to the highe&s;t ca&s;e of the upright which follows on the right; and from the la&s;t ca&s;e of a Tran&s;ver&s;e they return to the left to the fir&s;t ca&s;e of the Tran&s;ver&s;e immediately inferior.</P>
<P N="3">3. When the way is interrupted, they re-a&s;&s;ume two ca&s;es underneath that which they filled; and if there remains no ca&s;e underneath, or that there re|mains but one, the fir&s;t ca&s;e of the upright is thought to return in order after the la&s;t, as if it was indeed underneath the lowe&s;t.</P>

<P N="1">1. The &s;quare being divided by ca&s;es, to be filled with numbers in the Magical order, he augments it before all things by the &s;quare &s;ides in this manner.

Over this fir&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e contracted he adds a &s;econd contracted by two new ca&s;es.

<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition it is evident that the ca&s;es of the true &s;quare are alternately full, and alternately empty, and that its two Diameters are entirely full. Now the full ca&s;es receive not any change in the &s;equel of the operation, and the Dia|meters remain always &s;uch as they are by po&s;ition in the &s;quare augmented: but
<PB N="231" REF="130">
for the ca&s;es of the true &s;quare, which are likewi&s;e void, they mu&s;t be filled with the numbers which are in the ca&s;es of Augmentation, by tran&s;porting the high ones lower, and the low ones higher, each into its upright; tho&s;e of the right to the left, and tho&s;e of the left to the right, each into its tran&s;ver&s;e, and all to as many ca&s;es, as there are in the &s;ide of the real &s;quare. Thus in the &s;quare of 9 ca&s;es, which has only three in its &s;ide, the unite, which is in the ca&s;e of Augmentation at the top, is removed to the third ca&s;e below in the &s;ame upright; 9, which is in the ca&s;e of Augmentation below, is removed to the third ca&s;e above in the &s;ame upright; 3, which is in the ca&s;e of Augmen|tation on the right, is remov'd toward the left, to the third ca&s;e in the &s;ame tran&s;ver&s;e; and in fine, 7, which is in the ca&s;e of Augmentation on the left, is removed towards the right, to the third ca&s;e in the &s;ame tran&s;ver&s;e.</P>
<P>After the &s;ame manner, in the &s;quare of 25 ca&s;es, which has 5 in its &s;ide, the numbers, which are in the ca&s;es of Augmentation above, do de&s;cend 5 ca&s;es below each in its upright. Tho&s;e of the ca&s;es of Augmentation below do a&s;cend five ca&s;es above each in its upright. Tho&s;e of the ca&s;es of Augmen|tation on the right do pa&s;s 5 ca&s;es to the left, each in its tran&s;ver&s;e: and tho&s;e of the ca&s;es of Augmentation on the left do pa&s;s 5 ca&s;es to the right, each al&s;o in its tran&s;ver&s;e. It ought to be the &s;ame in all the other &s;quares proportionably, and thereby they will become all Magical.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Definitions.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IN the augmented &s;quare of <HI>Bachet,</HI> the ranks of Augmentation &s;hall be called <HI>Complements</HI> of the ranks of the true &s;quare, into which the num|bers of the ranks of Augmentation mu&s;t be removed: and the ranks which mu&s;t receive the Complements, &s;hall be called defective ranks. Now as by <HI>Bachet</HI>'s method every number of the ca&s;es of Augmentation mu&s;t be removed to as many ca&s;es as there are in the &s;ide of the true &s;quare, it follows that eve|ry defective rank is as far di&s;tant from its Complements, as there are ca&s;es in the &s;ide of the true &s;quare.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e that the true &s;quare, that is to &s;ay, that which it is nece&s;&s;ary to fill with numbers according to the Magical Order, is always comprehended in the &s;quare augmented, I will con&s;ider it in the &s;quare augmented, and I will call its ranks and its diameters, the ranks and diameters of the true &s;quare: but its ranks, whether tran&s;ver&s;e or upright, &s;hall comprehend the ca&s;es, which they have at both ends; becau&s;e that the numbers which are in the ca&s;es of Aug|mentation, proceed neither from their tran&s;ver&s;e nor from their upright, when removed into the ca&s;es of the true &s;quare, according to <HI>Bachet</HI>'s method.</P>

<P>FRom hence it follows. 1. That the diameters of the augmented &s;quare have each all the <HI>Latin</HI> and all the <HI>Greek</HI> Letters, becau&s;e that they have each a ca&s;e of every band, and a ca&s;e of every bar, and that the ca&s;es of every band do give them all the <HI>Latin</HI> Letters, and the ca&s;es of each bar all the <HI>Greek.</HI> The &s;um then of the&s;e two diameters is the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> that of all the Letters, as well <HI>Greek</HI> as <HI>Latin,</HI> taken at once. Now the&s;e two diameters do make an up|right and a tran&s;ver&s;e in the Magical &s;quare, becau&s;e that in the operation of <HI>Bachet,</HI> their &s;um changes not by the lo&s;s or acqui&s;ition of any number, as I have already remarked.</P>
<P N="2">2. As the ranks of the true &s;quare, whether tran&s;ver&s;e or upright, are as di|&s;tant from their complements, as there are ca&s;es in the &s;ide of the true &s;quare, it follows that the bands, and the bars, which begin with a complement, or above this complement, touch not, that is to &s;ay, have no ca&s;e at the defective rank of this complement; and that the bands and the bars which begin with a defe|ctive rank or above, have no ca&s;e in its complement: the Letters then of the defective rank, are all different from tho&s;e of the complements; becau&s;e that different bands have different <HI>Latin</HI> Letters, and that different bars have diffe|rent <HI>Greek</HI> Letters. But becau&s;e that all the bands, and all the bars, have each a ca&s;e in all the defective ranks, or in their complements: then every defective rank whatever, will have all the Letters, when it &s;hall have received its com|plement; it will have all the <HI>Latin,</HI> becau&s;e that all the bands, pa&s;&s;ing through every defective rank, or through its complement, do there leave all the <HI>Latin</HI>

And thus all the defective ranks will make the &s;ame &s;um in the Magical &s;quare, and the &s;ame &s;um as the diameters of the &s;quare augmented, which are the two &s;ole ranks not defective of the true &s;quare.</P>

<HEAD>That this Method cannot agree to even Squares.</HEAD>
<P>THE Demon&s;tration which I have given, agrees to the equal &s;quares, as well as to the unequal, in this that in the augmented equal &s;quare, every defective rank and its complement do make the &s;um, which a range of the Ma|gical &s;quare ought to make: But there is this inconvenience to the equal &s;quares, that the numbers of the ca&s;es of Augmentation, do find the ca&s;es of the true &s;quare filled with other numbers, which they ought to fill; becau&s;e that every ca&s;e is full, which goes in an equal rank after a full ca&s;e, and that in the equal &s;quares, the ca&s;es of the defective ranks do come in an equal rank, after tho&s;e of the complements, the defective ranks being as remote from the complements, as the &s;ide of the &s;quare has ca&s;es, and the &s;ide of every equal &s;quare having its ca&s;es in equal number.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Diameters of the unequal Magical Squares.</HEAD>
<P>BY <HI>Bachet</HI>'s operation it is clear, that he under&s;tands that the diameters are &s;uch as they ought to be, by the &s;ole po&s;ition of the numbers in the aug|mented &s;quare: and this will be always true, provided only that it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the number of the ca&s;e of the middle of each band, be a mean Arithmetic proportion between the other numbers of the &s;ame band, taken two by two: a condition, which is naturally included in the ordinary Problem of the Magi|cal &s;quares, wherein it is demanded that all the numbers be in Arithmetical proportion continued. <HI>Alternando</HI> the mean number of each bar, will be al&s;o a mean Arithmetic proportional between all the numbers of the &s;ame bar taken two by two: and hereby every mean, taken as many times as there are ca&s;es in the band, or in the bar, which is all one, will be equal to the total &s;um of the band, or of the bar. Therefore all the means of the bands, taken as many times as there are ca&s;es in every band, or which is all one, in the &s;ide of the &s;quare, will be equal to the total &s;um of the &s;quare: then taken once only, they will be equal to the &s;um of one of the ranks of the Magical &s;quare; and it will be the &s;ame of the means of the bars: and becau&s;e that the means of the bands do make one diameter, and the means of the bars the other, it is proved that the diameters will be exact by the &s;ole po&s;ition of the numbers in the augmented &s;quare, provided that every mean of a band, be a mean Arith|metic proportional between all the numbers of its band, taken two by two.</P>
<P>In a word, as in the &s;quares there are no augmented pairs, nor <HI>true</HI> &s;quare, nor diameters of the <HI>true</HI> &s;quare, becau&s;e that the bands of the equal &s;quares have not a mean number, 'tis likewi&s;e a rea&s;on, which evinces that this me|thod, cannot be accommodated to the equal &s;quares.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Preparation to the Demon&s;tration.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve in di&s;po&s;ing the&s;e Letters, that after having cho|&s;en the capital ca&s;e of the &s;econd band, near a Letter of the fir&s;t band, which I will call the Letter of Indication, &s;o that this &s;econd capital ca&s;e be al&s;o the &s;econd ca&s;e of the bar which begins with this Letter of Indication, one may chu&s;e the capital ca&s;e of the third band, near the Letter of the &s;econd band, like to the fir&s;t Letter of Indication, &s;o that this third capital ca&s;e be the third of the bar, wherein &s;hall be the &s;econd Letter of Indication. After the &s;ame manner &s;hall be determin'd the capital ca&s;e of every band, near the Letter of Indication of the precedent band. From whence it follows, that there are as many capital ca&s;es as bands, and no more.</P>
<P>It follows al&s;o, that not only the Letter <HI>d</HI> is always under the Letter <HI>c</HI> in the &s;ame bar, but that all the other Letters are always under the &s;ame Letters in the &s;ame bars, and that the Letters have likewi&s;e the &s;ame order in all the bars, as they have the &s;ame in all the bands, though the orders of the Letters in the bars, is not the &s;ame as the order of the Letters in the bands.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="235" REF="132">1. The choice of the capital ca&s;e of the &s;econd band, which determines that of the re&s;t, is not entirely arbitrary. To regulate it 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to have re|gard to the number of the ranks of the true &s;quare, which is the number 5 in the preceding example, and which is always the &s;quare root of the number, which expre&s;&s;es the multitude of the ca&s;es of the true &s;quare, and &s;o I will call it the root of the &s;quare.</P>
<P>Take then a number at your own choice, provided neverthele&s;s that it be le&s;s than the root of the &s;quare, and fir&s;t to this very root, and that by adding two points, it be &s;till fir&s;t at the &s;ame root of the &s;quare: 'Twill be by this number, that we &s;hall determine the choice of the &s;econd capital ca&s;e: and we call it the number determining.</P>
<P>The &s;econd capital ca&s;e mu&s;t not be the &s;econd ca&s;e of the &s;econd band, be|cau&s;e that this &s;econd ca&s;e is found in the upright diameter of the augmented &s;quare, and that there mu&s;t not be two Letters alike in any of the diameters of the augmented &s;quare: and &s;o as the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e is already in the upright diameter, the &s;econd cannot be there. It is nece&s;&s;ary on the contrary, that the ca&s;e which you &s;hall chu&s;e in the &s;econd band, for the &s;econd capital, be as far di&s;tant from the &s;econd ca&s;e of the upright diameter, as your determining num|ber &s;hall have Unites, and at the &s;ame time your &s;econd capital &s;hall be removed from the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e as many tran&s;ver&s;es, as your determining number &dagger; 2 &s;hall have Unites. Thus in the preceding example, the &s;econd capital ca&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the ca&s;e of the &s;econd band, where is the Letter <HI>d,</HI> is the &s;econd ca&s;e after that, which is in the upright diameter, and it is in the fourth tran&s;ver&s;e underneath the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e, which alone is looked upon as a tran&s;ver&s;e, and the number 2, which determines this &s;econd capital ca&s;e, is fir&s;t to 5, which is the root of the &s;quare, and 2 &dagger; 2 that is to &s;ay 4, is likewi&s;e fir&s;t to 5, the third ca&s;e of the &s;econd band is therefore the fir&s;t, which removes from the upright diameter, and it is with this that it is nece&s;&s;ary to begin to compute the di&s;tance of the re&s;t: &s;o that the fir&s;t ca&s;e of this &s;econd band is in this &s;en&s;e the remote&s;t of the &s;econd ca&s;e, though to reckon after a contrary &s;en&s;e it touches it.</P>
<P>You may then in the preceding example, where the root of the &s;quare is 5, take either 1 or 2, or 4, which do give you three different ca&s;es, of which you may make your &s;econd capital ca&s;e, 1 is fir&s;t to 5, and 1 will give you the ca&s;e wherein is <HI>b,</HI> three tran&s;ver&s;es di&s;tant from the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e. 2 is fir&s;t to 5, and 2 &dagger; 2 that is to &s;ay 4, is al&s;o fir&s;t to 5, and 2 will give you the ca&s;e wherein is <HI>d,</HI> 4 tran&s;ver&s;es di&s;tant from the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e. 3 is al&s;o fir&s;t to 5, but becau&s;e that 3 &dagger; 2, that is to &s;ay 5, is not fir&s;t to 5, 3 can give you in this example only a fal&s;e capital ca&s;e. 4 is fir&s;t to 5, and 4 &dagger; 2 that is to &s;ay 6, is al&s;o fir&s;t to 5, but from 6 it is nece&s;&s;ary to deduct 5 which is the root, and there will remain 1. And 4 will give you the ca&s;e wherein is <HI>e,</HI> the fourth in di&s;tance from the ca&s;e of the diameter ri&s;ing, and has a tran&s;ver&s;e near the fir&s;t capital. The number 4 will give you then <HI>Bachet</HI>'s di&s;po&s;ition, who has placed all the capital ca&s;es in the fir&s;t bar: and as often as for a determining number you &s;hall take a le&s;s number by an Unite, than the root of the &s;quare, you will fall into <HI>Bachet</HI>'s di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="3">3. From hence it follows, that the diameter a&s;cending will not have any other capital ca&s;e than the fir&s;t, which it has already, and that &s;o it will not have twice the Letter, which &s;hall be in the capital ca&s;es. To prove it let us &s;uppo&s;e that our bands be &s;ufficiently extended towards the right, to make as many new uprights as we de&s;ire; and let us mark the fir&s;t upright, which &s;hall be as di&s;tant from the diameter a&s;cending, as the root of the &s;quare has Unites: that is to &s;ay, which &s;hall be the fifth on the right of the diameter a&s;cending, if the root of the &s;quare is 5. And at a like di&s;tance from this fir&s;t upright marked, let us mark a &s;econd, and then a third, and a fourth, always at an equal di&s;tance one from the other, until that there are as many uprights marked, as the determining number has Unites. In this ca&s;e as the determining number and the root of the &s;quare are fir&s;t among&s;t them, the la&s;t upright marked will be the &s;ole one, who&s;e di&s;tance to take it from the diameter a&s;cending, would be divi&s;ible by the determining number.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="133">Suppo&s;e al&s;o, that now the bands are long enough, the capital ca&s;es are mark|ed all together, and without ever returning to the fir&s;t ca&s;es of the bands, as it was nece&s;&s;ary to do, before that the bands were extended, becau&s;e that then they had not ca&s;es enough after the capital, to receive all the Letters &s;ucce&s;&s;ively. I &s;ay that in the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, none of the&s;e marked uprights will have a capi|tal ca&s;es except the la&s;t: becau&s;e that it is the &s;ole marked upright, who&s;e di|&s;tance from the diameter a&s;cending unto it, is divi&s;ible by the determining number: for as the uprights, wherein are the capital ca&s;es, are as remote (<HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t from the upright, the &s;econd from the fir&s;t, the third from the &s;econd, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively) as the determining number has Unites, it follows that no upright has a capital ca&s;e when the di&s;tance from the upright diameter unto it, is not divi&s;ible by the determining number. 'Tis proved then that no marked up|right, except the la&s;t, will have a capital ca&s;e: and the capital ca&s;e which it &s;hall have will be the fir&s;t beyond the number of the ca&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to your augmented &s;quare, becau&s;e that in counting the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e, there will be as many others before this, as the root of the &s;quare has Unites.</P>
<P>Now when you mark the capital ca&s;es in a &s;quare augmented, according to the methed which I have given, &s;o that when you arrive at the la&s;t ca&s;e of a band, you return to its fir&s;t ca&s;e, as if it was after the la&s;t, you do no other thing, than &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to place all the capital ca&s;es, in re&s;pect of the diameter a&s;cending, as in the ca&s;e of the exten&s;ion of the bands, you will place one after the other in regard of all the uprights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively marked. And none of your capital ca&s;es, except a fir&s;t &s;upernumerary, can fall into your a&s;cending diame|ter, as no other, except a fir&s;t &s;upernumerary, could fall into your la&s;t upright marked.</P>
<P N="4">4. But if you con&s;ider the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e, as a tran&s;ver&s;e, and that you make the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;itions as before, &s;o that there are as many tran&s;ver&s;es marked, as the determining number &dagger; 2 &s;hall have Unites, and as di&s;tant (<HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t from the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e, the &s;econd from the fir&s;t, the third from the &s;econd, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively) as the root of the &s;quare &s;hall have Unites: From this that the root of the &s;quare and the determining number &dagger; 2 are fir&s;t among&s;t them, and from this that the determining number &dagger; 2 expre&s;&s;es the di&s;tance of the tran&s;ver&s;es, wherein will be the capital ca&s;es, you will prove that there &s;hall be only the la&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e marked, which has a capital ca&s;e, which will be the fir&s;t &s;upernumerary: and con&s;equently, that the defective rank, the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e of which is the complement, will have no capital ca&s;e, becau&s;e that it is the fir&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e marked: and you will prove al&s;o that the fir&s;t &s;upernumerary capital ca&s;e mu&s;t return to the tran&s;ver&s;e of the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e, and as it mu&s;t return likewi&s;e to the upright diameter, it follows that the fir&s;t &s;upernumerary ca&s;e, that is to &s;ay, that which you would mark after the la&s;t of the nece&s;&s;ary, is the fir&s;t capital ca&s;e, becau&s;e there is only this which is common to its tran&s;|ver&s;e, and to the upright diameter.</P>
<P N="5">5. From the order of the letters, alike in all the bands and alike al&s;o in all the bars, you will prove that all the letters alike, are at the &s;ame di&s;tance one from the other, and in the &s;ame order among&s;t them, as the letters of the ca|pital ca&s;es among&s;t them, and that &s;o all the ca&s;es which contain letters alike may be con&s;idered as capital, &s;o that two letters alike, are never found in the &s;ame upright, nor in the &s;ame tran&s;ver&s;e, nor in a defective rank, nor in its complement.

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Demon&s;tration.</HEAD>
<P>THis &s;uppo&s;ed, the demon&s;tration of the Problem is ea&s;ie, for whereas no letter is twice in any of the diameters of the augmented &s;quare, nor in any defective rank and its complement, it follows that every of the two dia|meters, and every defective rank and its complement have all the letters, and that con&s;equently they make the &s;ame &s;umm.</P>
</DIV3>

<PB N="237" REF="133">
<HEAD>Of the Diameters.</HEAD>
<P>THe Band which makes one of the diameters being Magical by po&s;ition, as it ought to be, continues Magical, becau&s;e that it receives not any new Letter, nor lo&s;es any of its own. The bar which makes the other diameter is found Magical by the di&s;po&s;ition, and the proof is this.</P>
<P>As far as the bar of the &s;econd capital ca&s;e is removed from the fir&s;t bar, &s;o much the bar of the third capital ca&s;e, is removed from the bar of the &s;econd, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, the fir&s;t bars to which you return, being reckon'd in this ca&s;e as coming after the la&s;t. Now the bar of the &s;econd capital ca&s;e is as far di&s;tant from the fir&s;t as there are Unites in the determining number &dagger; 1. Therefore if the determining number &dagger; 1 is fir&s;t to the root of the &s;quare, the preceding demon&s;tration &s;ufficeth to prove, that not any bar will have two Let|ters alike, wherefore the bar which &s;hall &s;erve as the diameter, will not have two Letters alike, and &s;o it will have all the Letters once.</P>
<P>But if the determining number &dagger;1 is an <HI>aliquot</HI> part of the root of the &s;quare, then each bar will have as many Letters alike, as there &s;hall be Unites in the determining number &dagger; 1, and there will be as many different Letters, as there &s;hall be Unites in the other <HI>aliquot</HI> part of the root of the &s;quare, which &s;hall be the quotient of the divi&s;ion made from the root by the determining number &dagger; 1. The&s;e &s;everal Letters will be therefore in an odd number, becau&s;e that this quotient can be only an odd number, being an <HI>aliquot</HI> of an odd number Of the&s;e Letters in an odd number, the one will be the middle of the fir&s;t band, the others, taken two by two, will be like to the Letters of the fir&s;t band, which taken al&s;o two by two, will be equally remote from the middle, the one to|wards the head of the band, the other towards the tail: So that if the order of the Letters of the fir&s;t band, is as the middle by its &s;ituation, or middle pro|portional between all the others, which, taken two by two, &s;hall be equally remote from it, then the bar which &s;hall &s;erve as diameter will be Magical, be|cau&s;e that if it has not the middle Letters of all the bands, it will have the power thereof; for the other Letters, which &s;hall not be mean, if being taken two by two, the one is weaker than the middle of its band, the other will be &s;tronger as much as the middle of its own; and thus the two together will coun|tervail the middle of their bands. As for example, in the &s;quare of 81 ca&s;es, the root of which is 9, if the determining number is 2, as 2 &dagger; 1, that is to &s;ay, 3 is the <HI>aliquot</HI> part of 9, the corre&s;ponding <HI>aliquot</HI> of which, that is to &s;ay that, which returns from the divi&s;ion of 9 by 3, is al&s;o 3, there will be in each bar three &s;everal Letters which will every one be there repeated three times. The fir&s;t of the different will be the middle of the fir&s;t band, the two others between the different, will be alike to two of the fir&s;t band equally di&s;tant from the mid|dle. After the &s;ame manner in the &s;quare of 225 ca&s;es, the root of which is 15, if the determining number is likewi&s;e 2, as 2 &dagger; 1, that is to &s;ay, 3 is the <HI>ali|quot</HI> part of 15 (of which 5 is the <HI>aliquot</HI> corre&s;ponding) it will happen that in every bar there will be 5 &s;everal Letters repeated every one three times. The one will be the middle of the fir&s;t band, the 4 others will be alike to 4 of the fir&s;t band, which taken two by two will be equidi&s;tant from the middle.</P>
<P>The Conclu&s;ion is then, that when the determining number &dagger; 1, is fir&s;t to the root of the &s;quare, the bar which &s;erves as diameter can only be Magical: but that if the determining number &dagger; 1, is <HI>aliquot</HI> of the root of the &s;quare, the bar which &s;erves as diameter cannot be Magical; that the middle Letter of the fir&s;t band, cannot be the middle Arithmetic of all the other Letters of its fir&s;t band two by two, and that it is not the Letters of its band, which, taken two by two, are at equal di&s;tances from it, and the like of which ought to en|ter into the bar, which &s;hall &s;erve as diameter. After this the order of the Let|ters of the fir&s;t band is arbitrary.</P>
<P>In a word, the neare&s;t of the&s;e equidi&s;tant Letters, &s;hall be each as di&s;tant from the middle, as the determining number &dagger; 1 &s;hall have Unites, the follow|ing
<PB N="238" REF="134">
&s;hall be as remote from the&s;e fir&s;t, every one from its own, and &s;o &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid that it is nece&s;&s;ary to take the &s;econd capital ca&s;e in the &s;econd band, tho it may be taken in &s;uch other band as one plea&s;es, provided that the band of the third capital ca&s;e be as di&s;tant from the band of the &s;econd ca&s;e, as this &s;hall be from the fir&s;t, and that the band of the fourth capital ca&s;e be at this very di&s;tance from the band of the third, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, the fir&s;t bands re|turning in order after the la&s;t. But be&s;ides this, it is nece&s;&s;ary that this di&s;tance be expre&s;&s;ed by a number fir&s;t to the root of the &s;quare, and the thing will return to the &s;ame, that is to &s;ay, to put a capital ca&s;e in each band. But if you put the &s;econd capital ca&s;e in a band, who&s;e di&s;tance from the fir&s;t band, was not expre&s;&s;ed by a number fir&s;t to the root of the &s;quare, then &s;everal capital ca&s;es would fall in the fir&s;t band, which being &s;uppo&s;ed full of all the different Let|ters, could not receive the like Letters, which fill the capital ca&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>Another way of varying the Magical Squares.</HEAD>
<P>YOU &s;hall double the preceding variations, if you perform in the bars what you did in the bands, and in the bands what you performed in the bars; taking for one of the diameters, a bar which &s;hould be Magical by po&s;i|tion, and rendring Magical by di&s;po&s;ition the band which &s;hall be the other diameter.</P>
<P>From the&s;e Principles it follows, that the &s;quare of 9 ca&s;es is always the &s;ame, without being able to receive e&s;&s;ential varieties, becau&s;e that it can have only two for the determining number: and becau&s;e that the removing of the bands, or of the bars among&s;t them, makes only a &s;imple &s;ubver&s;ion, by rea&s;on that there are only two bands and two bars &s;ubject to tran&s;po&s;ition, and that the band and the bar which &s;erve as diameters cannot be di&s;placed.</P>
<P>It follows al&s;o, that always one of the diameters at lea&s;t mu&s;t be Magical by po&s;ition: and that the greate&s;t and lea&s;t of the number propo&s;ed to fill a Magi|cal &s;quare, can never be at the center, becau&s;e that the center is always filled by one of the numbers of the diameter by po&s;ition, in which, be it band or bar, the greate&s;t nor &s;malle&s;t number cannot be.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the middle number of the whole &s;quare, that is to &s;ay, that which by the po&s;ition is at the center of the augmented &s;quare, will remain at the center of the Magical &s;quare, as often as the diameter by po&s;ition &s;hall have the capital ca&s;e at one of its ends, but in every other ca&s;e it will go out thence, and yet it will never depart from the diameter by po&s;ition.</P>
<P>All which things mu&s;t be under&s;tood according to the &s;uppo&s;itions above ex|plained. Be&s;ides I know that the uneven Magical &s;quares may be varied into a &s;urprizing number of ways, unto which all that I have &s;aid would not agree.</P>
<P>In fine, one of the diver&s;e methods, which re&s;ult from the Principles which I have explained, is <HI>Indian,</HI> as may be proved, by removing into an augmented &s;quare the numbers of an <HI>Indian</HI> Magical &s;quare, in &s;uch a manner, that the ca&s;es of Augmentation be full of the Numbers, which they mu&s;t render to the true &s;quare.

<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s is to di&s;po&s;e the&s;e numbers magically into another &s;quare of as many ca&s;es and empty.</P>
<P N="1">1. In con&s;idering this &s;quare, I &s;ee that the two diameters, and the middle upright and tran&s;ver&s;e means do make the &s;ame &s;umm: which Mr. <HI>de Malezieu</HI> thought to have given ground to the Problem, out of a de&s;ire of rendering the other tran&s;ver&s;es and other uprights equal al&s;o, without de&s;troying the equality of Diagonals.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;ee that the fir&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e contains all the numbers, from the unite to the root of the &s;quare: that the &s;econd tran&s;ver&s;e contains the&s;e &s;ame numbers and in the &s;ame order, but augmented every one with a root: that the third contains al&s;o the&s;e very numbers in the &s;ame order, augmented every one with two roots: that it is the &s;ame in every tran&s;ver&s;e, &s;ave that the fourth has every one of the&s;e numbers augmented with three roots, that the fifth hath them augmented with four roots, and &s;o in proportion of the other tran&s;ver&s;es, if there were more.</P>

<P>It is clear that in this di&s;po&s;ition not any tran&s;ver&s;e, nor any upright have two numbers, neither from the &s;ame tran&s;ver&s;e, nor from the &s;ame upright of the natural &s;quare, and that the diameter which we have not made by po&s;ition, has al&s;o only one number from every tran&s;ver&s;e, and every upright of the natu|ral &s;quare. This is what M. <HI>de Malezieu</HI> thought, without having had the lei&s;ure to fathom it further; and it is evidently the Principle, on which the <HI>Indian</HI> Method and that of <HI>Bachet</HI> are grounded, and all the others, of which I have &s;hown, that it is po&s;&s;ible to vary the Magical &s;quares. And if care be taken that in a Magical &s;quare the ranks parallel to the diameters are defective, and that they have their complements, it will be &s;een that <HI>Bachet</HI>'s augmented &s;quare, and the Magical &s;quare have oppo&s;ite proprieties. In the augmented &s;quare, the bands which are the true ranks, are not Magical, and its defective ranks aug|mented with their complements are. On the contrary, in the Magical &s;quare the ranks are Magical, and the defective ranks and their complements do con|tain, every one, what a band of the augmented &s;quare contains.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h what M. <HI>de Malezieu</HI> has thought, it is nece&s;&s;ary only to accommo|date what we have &s;aid concerning the choice of the capital ca&s;es: and becau&s;e that this is ea&s;ie to do, I will &s;peak no more of it.</P>
<P>M. <HI>de Malezieu</HI> thought likewi&s;e, that this principle might &s;erve to the even &s;quares, and this is true: but here likewi&s;e there is found difficulty in the exe|cution, becau&s;e that in the even &s;quares, the defective ranks and their comple|ments have every one a ca&s;e in the &s;ame diameter, or have none at all, &s;o that by di&s;per&s;ing the numbers from a tran&s;ver&s;e into a defective rank, and its comple|ment, two numbers of this tran&s;ver&s;e are put into the &s;ame diameter, or el&s;e none at all, and the one and the other of the&s;e two things is equally bad. Be|&s;ides there is no tran&s;ver&s;e in the even &s;quares, which can furni&s;h a diameter by po&s;ition: and &s;o it would be nece&s;&s;ary to remove a little into the even &s;quares, after the <HI>Indian</HI> manner of di&s;pencing the numbers, and to put one into each rank and one into each diameter. But the Method pre&s;ents not it &s;elf immediately. However here is the fir&s;t example thereof.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>Indian</HI> Method of the Even Squares.</HEAD>
<P>I Thought to have divined it from the examples of the &s;quares of 16, 36, and 64 ca&s;es, which <HI>Agrippa</HI> has given us.</P>
<P N="1">1. As the ranks are in even number in the even &s;quares, they may be con&s;i|dered two by two. Comparing then the fir&s;t to the la&s;t, the &s;econd to the la&s;t &s;ave one, the third to the la&s;t but two, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, by equally removing us from the fir&s;t and the la&s;t ranks, we will call them oppo&s;ite, be they tran&s;ver&s;e, or upright.</P>
<P>Now becau&s;e that the numbers of one rank, are arithmetically proportional with tho&s;e of another rank of the &s;ame way, it is clear to tho&s;e who under&s;tand arithmetical proportion, that two oppo&s;ite ranks do make the &s;ame total &s;um as two other oppo&s;ite ranks, and that if this &s;um be divided into two equals, each half will be the &s;um that a Magical rank ought to make.</P>
<P N="2">2. The oppo&s;ite numbers are al&s;o the fir&s;t and la&s;t of the whole &s;quare, the &s;econd and la&s;t &s;ave one, the third and la&s;t but two, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, by re|moving as equally from the fir&s;t and la&s;t numbers: &s;o that the &s;um of two oppo|&s;ite numbers is always equal to the &s;um of other oppo&s;ites.</P>
<P>From hence it is evident, that the numbers oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of one rank, are the numbers which are in the oppo&s;ite rank, and that to render the &s;ums of two oppo&s;ite ranks equal, it is nece&s;&s;ary only to take the moity of the numbers of one of the ranks, and to exchange them for their oppo&s;ites, which are in the other. As for Example

</TABLE>
1, 2, 3, 4, do make the fir&s;t natural rank of the &s;quare of 16 ca&s;es, and 13, 14, 15, 16, do make the la&s;t rank thereof. To render them equal, it is nece&s;&s;ary only to take 2 and 3, which are the moity of the numbers of the fir&s;t, and to exchange them for 14 and 15, their oppo&s;ites; and &s;o 1, 14, 15, 4, will make the &s;ame &s;um as 13, 2, 3, 16.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ver&s;es between them, and the uprights between them, may render them&s;elves equal by this Method: but becau&s;e that the choice of the oppo&s;ite numbers may be made after &s;everal ways, the <HI>Indians</HI> have cho&s;en one, that is ea&s;ie to retain, which leaves the diameters &s;uch as they are in the natural &s;quare, becau&s;e that they are &s;uch as they ought to be, and ranges the uprights, when it is intended only to range the tran&s;ver&s;es. The whole Method con&s;i&s;ts then in knowing how to range two oppo&s;ite tran&s;ver&s;es&punc; and the rules are the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. They take the half of the numbers of the upper tran&s;ver&s;e, and remove them to the lower: and they take their oppo&s;ite numbers in the lower tran&s;ver&s;e, and remove them to the upper.</P>
<P N="2">2. The numbers which remain in each rank, do remain there in their natu|ral place, and in their natural order: the tran&s;pro&s;ed do place them&s;elves every one in the ca&s;e of its oppo&s;ite, and con&s;equently in a &s;ubverted order.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t and the la&s;t numbers of every rank do continue in their natural rank, the &s;econd and third are tran&s;pro&s;ed, the fourth and the fifth remain, the &s;ixth and the &s;eventh are tran&s;pro&s;ed, and &s;o alternatively two are tran&s;pro|&s;ed, and two remain.</P>

After the &s;ame manner 57, 60, 61, 64, which remain in their rank, are in their natural ca&s;es, and in their natural or|der. 58, 59, 62, 63, which are removed, are in the ca&s;es of their oppo&s;ites, and in a &s;ubverted order.</P>
<P>All the oppo&s;ite ranks mu&s;t be ranged according to the&s;e few rules: but it is not always certain that it may be nece&s;&s;ary to put the fir&s;t number of the rank in the fir&s;t ca&s;e on the left; for after this manner the fir&s;t and la&s;t uprights would keep all their natural numbers, and would not be equal. Therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary to render them equal by the &s;ame rule as the tran&s;ver&s;es, by re|moving half of the numbers of the fir&s;t upright into the ca&s;es of their oppo&s;ites, leaving the fir&s;t and the la&s;t in their upright, removing the &s;econd and the third, leaving the fourth and the fifth, removing the &s;ixth and the &s;eventh, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;ively according to the rules that we have given for the tran&s;ver&s;es.

<P>The demon&s;tration thereof is palpable. For to con&s;ider the numbers, as we have ranked them in the fir&s;t and la&s;t tran&s;ver&s;es; it is evident that the oppo&s;ite numbers, taken two by two, are there placed either diametrically in the fir&s;t and la&s;t ca&s;es of every tran&s;ver&s;e, or directly oppo&s;ite in the &s;ame upright, and becau&s;e that the oppo&s;ite numbers taken, thus two by two, do always make equal &s;ums, it follows that the&s;e two tran&s;ver&s;es being at the top and at the bottom of the &s;quares equally even, and interior already Magical, will add equal &s;ums to the diameters, and to the uprights of this interior &s;quare equally even; and that &s;o the uprights and diameters of the &s;quare unequally, will be equal in their &s;ums. It will be the &s;ame of the tran&s;ver&s;es of the &s;quare unequally even, becau&s;e that its fir&s;t and its la&s;t uprights will likewi&s;e add equal &s;ums to the tran&s;ver&s;es of the interior &s;quare equally even. And our demon&s;tration would be compleat, were not the two numbers mean as well of the fir&s;t, and la&s;t tran&s;ver&s;es, as of the fir&s;t and la&s;t uprights: for the&s;e numbers not being placed every right again&s;t its oppo&s;ite, do add unequal &s;ums to the middle tran&s;ver&s;es and uprights of the interior &s;quare equally even. Therefore to repair this ine|quality, which is only of two points, it is nece&s;&s;ary to make a little alteration in the interior &s;quare equally even, which will be the la&s;t rule of this Method.</P>
<P N="6">6. By ranging the interior &s;quare equally even, according to the rules of the Magical &s;quares equally even; it is nece&s;&s;ary to invert the order, which accord|ing to the&s;e rules of the &s;quares equally even, the two middle numbers of the la&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e of the &s;quare of 16 ca&s;es, which is at the center of all, and the two middle numbers of the la&s;t upright of the &s;ame &s;quare of &s;ixteen ca&s;es, ought to have, you will thus weaken the fir&s;t middle upright, and the fir&s;t middle tran&s;|ver&s;e of the &s;quare equally even: fora&s;much as in the fir&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e of the &s;quare of 16 ca&s;es, the fir&s;t middle number is always &s;tronger than the &s;econd, and that in the la&s;t upright of the &s;ame &s;quare of 16 ca&s;es, the middle &s;uperior number is &s;tronger than the inferior.</P>

<P>In the &s;quare of 36 ca&s;es the numbers 9 and 10, which are the middle of the la&s;t tran&s;ver&s;e of the &s;quare of 16 ca&s;es, which is at the center, are in an order contrary to that which they ought to have, according to the rules of the &s;quares equally even. Thus 14 and 20, which are the middle of the la&s;t upright of the &s;ame &s;quare of 16 ca&s;es, are in a contrary number, to that which they ought to have by the &s;ame rules: for it would be nece&s;&s;ary that 10 was before 9, and 14 under 20.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="138">In the &s;quare of 100 ca&s;es at the &s;eventh tran&s;ver&s;e, the middle numbers 35 and 36 are placed again&s;t the very rules of the &s;quares equally even: 36 ought to precede 35 according to the rules: and 44 and 54 which are the middle of the &s;eventh upright are al&s;o inverted, becau&s;e that 44 ought to be under 54.</P>
<P>In every &s;quare equally even ranged Magically, according to the rules which I have given, it is infallible that in the tran&s;ver&s;e, which is immediately under the middle tran&s;ver&s;es, the two middle numbers &s;hould be in an inverted order, that is to &s;ay, the &s;tronge&s;t precedes the weake&s;t: for either the&s;e middle num|bers are removed, and con&s;equently in an inverted order, or they are not re|moved, and they are likewi&s;e in an inverted order, becau&s;e that then their tran&s;ver&s;e begins at the right: fora&s;much as if the middle numbers of each rank are not removed as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, the middle of the fir&s;t upright are not, and &s;o the middle tran&s;ver&s;es begin on the left, therefore the tran&s;ver&s;e underneath begins on the right. By a like ratiocination it will be proved, that according to the rules of the &s;quares equally even, the middle numbers of the upright, which is immediately after the middle uprights, are ranged in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;tronge&s;t is always above the weake&s;t.</P>
<P>This is <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s Method of the even &s;quares, which in my opinion are the <HI>Indian,</HI> the merit of which con&s;i&s;ts not in giving the &s;ole po&s;&s;ible manner of ranging the even &s;quares, but the mo&s;t ea&s;ie to execute by memory: For it is to this principally that it &s;eems, that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hould addict them&s;elves. In a word, the <HI>Indian</HI> even &s;quares are al&s;o Magical in the Geometrical Progre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> have two Principles for the Problem of the Magical &s;quares, the one of which they have applied to the uneven &s;quares, and the other to the even. The Mathematicians of this Country, which have laboured herein, have known only one of the&s;e two Principles, which is that of the even &s;quares; but they have adapted it likewi&s;e to the uneven &s;quares, and moreover they have added a &s;ingular condition to this Problem, which is that the Magical &s;quare be &s;o ranged, that in deducting its fir&s;t compa&s;s, that is to &s;ay its fir&s;t and its la&s;t tran&s;ver&s;es, its fir&s;t and its la&s;t uprights, the interior &s;quare which &s;hall re|main is found Magical, after this very kind, that is to &s;ay, being able to lo&s;e all its compa&s;&s;es one after the other, and to leave always for the re&s;t a Magical &s;quare, provided that this re&s;idue have at lea&s;t 9, or 16 ca&s;es; becau&s;e that the &s;quare of 4 ca&s;es cannot be Magical.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Arnoud</HI> has given the &s;olution of this la&s;t Problem at the end of his Elements of Geometry, and before that he had printed it the fir&s;t time, I had al&s;o re&s;olved this Problem in its whole extent, having been propo&s;ed to me by the late Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Fermat,</HI> Coun&s;ellor in the Parliament of <HI>Tholou&s;e,</HI> who&s;e Memory is yet in Veneration among&s;t the learned: but then I divined not <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s Principle of the unequal &s;quares, nor the rea&s;on of <HI>Bachet</HI>'s Method.</P>
<P>In fine, I am obliged to render this Te&s;timony to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sauveur,</HI> Pro|fe&s;&s;or of the Mathematics at <HI>Paris,</HI> that he found out a Demon&s;tration of the <HI>Indian</HI> uneven &s;quares, which Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Melezieu</HI> communicated unto him: and that he has al&s;o invented a Method to range the even &s;quares. I leave unto him the care of publi&s;hing this, and &s;everal other things of his own Invention, becau&s;e that this Chapter is already too long.</P>

<HEAD>The Care of the Manners among&s;t the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and of the Antiquities of their Hi&s;tory.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CHina</HI> is happily &s;ituated, having no foreign war to fear. It has no other Neighbours then <HI>Tartary</HI> on the North, and <HI>Tonguin</HI> on the We&s;t. Every where el&s;e it is bounded either by the Ocean, or with a de&s;art of &s;everal days Journey, or with Woods, and Mountains almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able. <HI>Tonquin</HI> is a very little &s;tate, if compar'd to <HI>China:</HI> and it is &s;eated under tho&s;e hot cli|mates, from whence it never comes out as Conqueror. The <HI>Tartar</HI> is continu|ally
<PB N="248" REF="139">
accu&s;tomed only to make incur&s;ions on his Enemies, and not wars in form. A wall on the frontiers of <HI>China,</HI> which &s;tops the pa&s;&s;ages, has &s;ufficed during a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Ages, to &s;top all the Enterprizes of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>It is no wonder then if the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are little addicted to War, and if the <HI>Tartars,</HI> tho more weak, and otherwi&s;e le&s;s proper to make Conque&s;ts, have yet &s;ubdued them twice in the &s;pace of three or four thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>But as much as the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have ignored war, as much are they experienc'd in the knowledge of Government. Their good natural wit has made them to improve it with &s;o much care in the repo&s;e which their Country has almo&s;t continually enjoyed, that next to the Laws which God gave unto <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> there are none perhaps which do make a compleater body of Policy, nor who&s;e parts concur better to the &s;ame end, than the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Laws. Thus this people is the mo&s;t numerous that has ever been in the World, except perhaps the people of God: which, in my opinion, is the be&s;t &s;ign of an happy Government.</P>
<P>I have &s;ufficiently declared in my relation, how the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have &s;uited their Religion to their Policy, by making of the &s;pirit of Heaven, and of the other &s;pirits an invi&s;ible Republick like to theirs, of which they &s;uppo&s;e that the members have a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the members of theirs, and that they puni&s;h the hidden faults of their Kings, of their Magi&s;trates, and of every one of their Citizens in particular.</P>
<P>I have ob&s;erved likewi&s;e how they have provided for the Perpetuity of their Laws, by the dread of their dead Parents, whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be provoked in the other life, with the faults which their Children commit in this, and e&s;pe|cially with the great want of re&s;pect which it would be in the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> towards their Ance&s;tors, to change the Laws which they have left them. 'Tis not there|fore a vain Ceremony that they mourn for three years with an extream Au&s;te|rity, and &s;eparated from all public Employment, which the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Laws do order Children to ob&s;erve at the death of their Father and Mother, and from which they di&s;pence not even their Kings. They cannot too much imprint in their minds this re&s;pect, which has always been their greate&s;t &s;upport.</P>
<P>But what I mo&s;t admire in the Laws of <HI>China,</HI> is the care which they have taken to form the Morals, &s;eeing that it is only good manners, which can main|tain the Laws, as it is only good Laws that can make good manners. <HI>Plato,</HI> methinks, under&s;tood the whole importance of this Maxim, and if my Me|mory fails me not, he requires in &s;ome places of his Laws, that they intermed|dle with the privacy of the Oeconomy of his Citizens: and becau&s;e he feared that this might appear too new to the People, &s;o free as the <HI>Greeks</HI> were in his time, he &s;ought &s;ome excu&s;e for the little which he delivered thereof.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> on the contrary, have not &s;crupled to give Laws to almo&s;t all the Actions of men. One of their mo&s;t ancient Books regulates not only the Rites, which concern Religion and the Sacrifices, but all the Duties of Chil|dren to their Father, and of the Father towards his Children; of the Husband to the Wife, and of the Wife to the Husband; of Brethren and Friends to each other; of the King to his Subjects, and of the Subjects to their King; of the Magi&s;trates to the People, and of the People to the Magi&s;trates. In this Book, which has the Authority of a Law, the old men are con&s;idered as the Fathers of all the People, and of the King him&s;elf, the Orphans are there con&s;idered as his Children, and all the Citizens as Brethren among&s;t them. Father <HI>Martinius</HI> reports,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hi&s;t. &s;in. p. 352.</NOTE> that there is almo&s;t no humane action, how &s;mall &s;oever it be, to which this Book pre&s;cribes not Laws, even to cau&s;e trouble for an exceeding &s;mall par|ticular. I doubt not that all the <HI>Europeans</HI> would judge like him, if this Book came to our knowledge, but this is neverthele&s;s a very ancient Te&s;timony, of the extream care which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have continually taken of good manners.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e they knew the prevalency which the example of Kings has over People, their greate&s;t &s;tudy has always been to in&s;pire Vertue into their Kings. <HI>The People,</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>is like the Ears of Corn wherewith a field is covered, the Morals of the Prince are like the Wind, which inclines them, where it li&s;teth.</HI></P>
<P>Their Policy has therefore no particuluar manners for their Kings, and other manners for the People. Their Kings are obliged to re&s;pect old men: they
<PB N="249" REF="139">
nouri&s;h them in every City; and the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory honourably mentions &s;uch of their Kings, which have rendered them mo&s;t re&s;pect, and &s;ome others, who have cau&s;ed their illegitimate Brethren, which precede them in Age, to &s;it down at their Table, and above them. Their Kings are obliged to the three years mourning upon the death of their Father and their Mother, and to ab&s;tain during this time from the cares of the Government, altho perhaps this Law has lo&s;t it Vigour in the la&s;t times. When <HI>China</HI> was as yet divided into little States, which were as &s;o many Fiefs of this great Empire, <HI>Ven-cum</HI> King of <HI>Cin</HI> cha&s;ed out of his little Kingdom by his Step-mother, would not undertake a war to re-enter, till he had mourn'd for his Father three years.</P>
<P>They believe among&s;t other things, that their dead Parents can &s;horten or prolong the life of their Children; they de&s;ire of them a long and happy life, and upon this ridiculous ground, they have in the &s;ame terms with us, this pre|cept, which we have from God him&s;elf, and of which his eternal verity is pro|tecter unto us: <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother that thou maye&s;t enjoy a long life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Xin</HI> the fir&s;t King of the Race <HI>Cina,</HI> having bani&s;hed his Mother for her in|continence, and becau&s;e that his Adulterer made u&s;e of the favour of this Prin|ce&s;s to revolt, and to a&s;&s;emble a great Army, was con&s;trained by all his Mini|&s;ters to recall her from exile, altho he had made him&s;elf King by force, and that thereby he &s;eemed to be &s;tronger than the Laws.</P>
<P><HI>Hoei</HI> the &s;econd King of the Race <HI>Hana,</HI> having al&s;o an uncha&s;t Mother, da|red not to puni&s;h her: but not being willing to reign and &s;uffer her debauche|ries, he abandon'd the Government to her out of an extream Piety, and plunged him&s;elf into debauchery: &s;o that <HI>Hiaovu</HI> the &s;ixth King of the &s;ame Race, put the Queen his wife to death, for fear of leaving behind him a debauched Wid|dow, and a Mother incommodious to his Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not end if I would relate all the examples of the extream re&s;pect which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have for their Father, and for their Mother: I will add only that they change not their Officers, as they innovate nothing in their Laws.</P>
<P>They are in&s;tructed al&s;o not to have le&s;s re&s;pect for their Governors, than particular per&s;ons have for their ma&s;ters. Their Governor they call <HI>Colao,</HI> whom they generally make their chief Mini&s;ter, as the Grand Segnior calls his Grand Vizier <HI>Lala,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>Governor.</HI> This re&s;pect is &s;o entire among&s;t them, that they cha&s;ti&s;e, as I have &s;aid, in &s;ome place of my Relation, the Go|vernor of the Prince the pre&s;umptive Heir of the Crown, for the faults which that Prince commits, and that there are found &s;ome Princes, who being become Kings have revenged their Governors.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the <HI>Colao,</HI> who is the King's principal Council, he has other Officers, who&s;e &s;ole Function is to reprehend him publicly for his Faults. <HI>Yvus</HI> the fir&s;t King of the race <HI>Hiaa,</HI> who according to their Hi&s;tory began to reign 2207 years before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> gave full liberty to all good per&s;ons to give him coun|&s;el: and yet becau&s;e that he found him&s;elf once reproved with too much &s;harp|ne&s;s, in the pre&s;ence of his principal Councellors, he was &s;o vexed thereat, that he had re&s;olved to put him to death who had given him this affront: but his Wife appea&s;ed him. Being adorned more than ordinary, &s;he pre&s;ented her &s;elf before him: and as he was &s;mitten with this dre&s;s, which in the perplexity wherein he was, &s;eemed to him improper, &s;he told him, that &s;he came to con|gratulate him, for having in his Court &s;uch couragious and faithful Servants, as dare to tell him the truth. This liberty of admoni&s;hing the Prince, pa&s;&s;ed af|terwards into a Law: There were, as I have &s;aid, &s;ome Offices purpo&s;ely cre|ated for the exerci&s;ing it; yet without taking it away from any other Officer of State: and the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have always been &s;o jealous of this Prerogative, that &s;everal have died to maintain it, and that there have been &s;ome examples, even in this Age, that when the King was ob&s;tinate not to hear any important reproof, the Officers of the Court, to the number &s;ometimes of two Thou&s;and, have entered into his Palace, there to lay down the Badges of their Offices. So that it is impo&s;&s;ible that a King of <HI>China</HI> can continue King, if he is vicious to a cer|tain degree. Thus, &s;ome tell him ince&s;&s;antly, that it is his example, which mu&s;t render the Magi&s;trates, and the People virtuous; and that if he departs
<PB N="250" REF="140">
from the Vertue of his Ance&s;tors, the Magi&s;trates and People growing debauch|ed in their Morals, would forget their fidelity which they owe him, and which is their fir&s;t duty, and their fir&s;t Vertue. Examples hereof are frequent in their Hi&s;tory: in which they have not better provided for the &s;ecurity of their Ma|&s;ter, than all the other De&s;potic States. According to them it is 4000 years that their Kingdom has continued in the&s;e Maxims, which render it the admi|ration of all its Neighbors. S^t^. <HI>Francis Xavier</HI> reports in his Letters that the <HI>Jap|pone&s;es</HI> ince&s;&s;antly objected to him, that the Chri&s;tian Religion could not be true, &s;eeing that it was not known by the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> Yet I know that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have &s;ome Vices, but they perhaps &s;in le&s;s again&s;t their Moral Law, than we do again&s;t ours. How much have our Morals degenerated from tho&s;e of our Ance&s;tors? and the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> more antient than us, do &s;till e&s;teem it a di&s;grace to violate their Morals in public, and to fail in the re&s;pects which they owe to one another, either by any di&s;obedience to their Parents, or by any quarrel with their equals. They are Infidels, &s;ay &s;ome, in Commerce; but it may be they are only &s;o with Strangers; as the <HI>Hebrews</HI> lent money to u&s;ury to Stran|gers only: and be&s;ides, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> which have Commerce with Strangers, are tho&s;e of the Frontiers, who&s;e manners this very foreign Commerce has de|praved.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Vice of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> is doubtle&s;s an extream Hypocri&s;y: but be&s;ides that it reigns every where, becau&s;e it is a Vice which is free from the cen&s;ure of the Laws, it is perhaps a le&s;s evil, than a publick corrup|tion.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory may be credited, 'tis Vertue alone that has formed this great Empire: the love of their Laws, which were at fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in a corner of this Country, gradually drew all the Neighbouring Provinces under the &s;ame yoke, it not appearing that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have conquered the&s;e Provin|ces by any war. It is true that all the&s;e little States, which were at the begin|ning as &s;o many hereditary Fiefs given u&s;ually to the Princes of the Royal Blood, have been reunited to the Crown by Civil Wars, when the Royal race has chang|ed, and that U&s;urpers have expelled the lawful Kings from the Throne; but it appears that the fir&s;t &s;ubjection of all the&s;e little States to the Crown of <HI>China</HI> has been voluntary. They &s;ay that 44 Kingdoms, enamoured with the Vertue of <HI>Venvam,</HI> &s;ubmitted to his Laws. He reigned over the two thirds of <HI>China,</HI> when it was yet divided. However it be, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have been continually Enemies to war, as the principal cau&s;e of the corruption of manners, and they have preferred Morality before all the Glory of Conque&s;ts, and all the advan|tages of Commerce with Strangers.</P>
<P>King <HI>Siven,</HI> the ninth of the Race <HI>Hana,</HI> 60 years before the birth of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> dreading the con&s;equences of any motion of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which &s;ometime before had been confined within their Mountains by <HI>Hiaovu,</HI> and who were re|turned to &s;eize on the flat Country, re&s;olved to prevent them, and make war upon them, before they had put them&s;elves in a condition to carry it into <HI>China.</HI> In another Country this Prudence might have been approved, but it was not at <HI>China,</HI> where the care of good manners is the main affair of the State. The Hi&s;tory therefore relates, that his Chief Mini&s;ter di&s;&s;waded him from this En|terprize by this di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>What, Sir, do you think to invade foreign Countrys, when there are &s;uch great things to reform in your own. A Prodigy to this hour unheard of among&s;t us! in this year a Son has &s;lain his Father, &s;even younger Brothers have killed their</HI> 25 <HI>elder Brethren. The&s;e are the &s;igns of an intolerable boldne&s;s, and which pre|&s;age a very dangerous corruption in our manners. 'Tis what we ought to be alarumed at; it is to what a &s;peedy remedy mu&s;t be applied; for &s;o long as the&s;e Crimes &s;hall not be &s;uf|fered at</HI> China, China <HI>will have nothing to fear from the</HI> Tartars: <HI>but if they were once permitted, I fear that they would not only extend them&s;elves into all the Territories of the Empire, but even into the Imperial Palace.</HI></P>
<P>Under <HI>Juen,</HI> the Tenth King of the &s;ame race, the Provinces of <HI>Qnantong,</HI> and <HI>Quang&s;i,</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Hainan</HI> revolting, he levied as many forces as it was po&s;&s;ible to reduce them to their Obedience: but <HI>Kia&s;u,</HI> whom he ap|pointed for their General diverted him from this war, by the&s;e words. <HI>Anci|ently
<PB N="251" REF="140">
the Kingdom of</HI> China, <HI>was bounded on the Ea&s;t by the Ocean, on the We&s;t by the Sandy De&s;art, and on the South by the River</HI> Kiang: <HI>but by little and little it enlarged its limits le&s;s by Arms, than by Vertue. Our Kings do kindly receive under their Empire, tho&s;e who voluntarily &s;ubmit them&s;elves out of Love to our Ju&s;tice and Clemency, and &s;eve|ral neighbouring Provinces &s;ubmitted thereunto: not any was compelled by force. 'Tis my advice that you ab&s;tain from this war, and that imitating the good Kings which have lived before you, you may make them to revive in your Maxims. The way to reduce a rebelious People to Obedience, is by the allurement of Vertue, and not by the horror of Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Yet <HI>China</HI> has had &s;ome conquering Kings, but two or three at mo&s;t, if I am not mi&s;taken: though they &s;ay, that <HI>Hiaovu,</HI> who was one of the&s;e, repented of the wars which he had made, and took no care to pre&s;erve his Conque&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Gu-Cupn</HI> one of the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Confucius,</HI> asked him one day what things were nece&s;&s;ary to a good Government, <HI>Plenty of Provi&s;ions,</HI> replied he, <HI>a &s;ufficient quan|tity of Souldiers and Ammunition for War, of Virtue in the King and his Subjects. I un|der&s;tand what you tell me,</HI> replied the Di&s;ciple, <HI>but if it were nece&s;&s;ary to lack one of the&s;e three things, which will you quit the fir&s;t? The Souldiers,</HI> an&s;wered the Philo&s;o|pher. <HI>But if there was a nece&s;&s;ity al&s;o of lacking Provi&s;ions or Vertue, which of the&s;e two lo&s;&s;es would you chu&s;e? I would chu&s;e,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>to want Provi&s;ions.</HI> He could not bet|ter te&s;tifie the Contempt of War, and the Love of good Morals. <HI>Plato</HI> would have but a &s;mall number of Citizens in his Republic, becau&s;e that he dreaded the corruption in too great a Multitude, and that he cared not &s;o much as his Republic &s;hould la&s;t, as that it &s;hould be happy, and con&s;equently virtuous, &s;o long as it did la&s;t.</P>
<P>In fine, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have never neglected the in&s;truction of the People. Be|&s;ides that it is ea&s;ie to know the Laws which are public, and which never alter, they publi&s;h every fifteen days, by Proclamation a &s;mall number of Precepts, which are the ground of their Moral Law, as the Commandments of God are ours.</P>
<P>They have not neglected Puni&s;hments, &s;eeing that the Magi&s;trates do an&s;wer for the faults of their Family, the Parents for the faults of their Children, the Superiors for the crimes of their Inferiors, and that they all have a right to pu|ni&s;h the faults of tho&s;e, for whom they an&s;wer: but I have already handled the&s;e things, and &s;ome others in my Relation,</P>
<P>This is what I had to &s;ay, concerning the care which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have had to to pre&s;erve their Morals, the duration of which is doubtle&s;s the greate&s;t won|der, that we have &s;een among men. It may be &s;u&s;pected, that their Hi&s;tory is flattering in &s;ome things. They can lye, without fearing to be contradicted by their Neighbors: and it is probable that they have not always &s;poken the Truth, &s;eeing that their Hi&s;tory is the work of their policy. The Office of an Hi&s;to|rian is among&s;t them a public Office. The Hi&s;tory of a King is written after his death, by the order of his Succe&s;&s;or, who &s;ometimes has been his Enemy; and not any Hi&s;tory is publi&s;hed, till the Race of the Kings whereof it treats, is extinct, or at lea&s;t driven from the Throne. It is not lawful for any Hi&s;to|rian, to call in que&s;tion the Hi&s;tory already written, nor for any particular per|&s;on to write Hi&s;tory: every one only may make Abridgments of the Hi&s;to|ries already publi&s;hed. There is therefore but one &s;ingle general Hi&s;tory, and no particular Memoirs. Yet there is no appearance that they have corrupted the mo&s;t important of the Events; and the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians cannot perhaps have been more faithful in what they have writ to the Honor of their Country, and to the Shame of their Enemies.</P>
<P>But a particular rea&s;on ca&s;ts a great doubt on the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory, from the beginning of their Monarchy to about 200 years before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>Xin</HI> the fir&s;t King of the Race <HI>Cina,</HI> who reigned about 200 years before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> burnt as far as it was po&s;&s;ible, all the Books of <HI>China,</HI> which treat|ed not of Medicine or Divination. Their Hi&s;tory &s;hows that he exerci&s;ed great cruelties, again&s;t tho&s;e which concealed Books, and that &s;o few e&s;caped his fury, and almo&s;t none entirely: A very &s;ingular event among&s;t tho&s;e who continually de&s;troy the Memorial of things pa&s;t. This therefore &s;ufficeth in my opinion to doubt, if one will, whether this great Empire could be formed without any war.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="141">Notwith&s;tanding this lo&s;s of their Books, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> cea&s;e not to give a compleat Hi&s;tory not only from the beginning of their Monarchy, but from the Origine of Mankind, which they make to re-a&s;cend &s;everal thou&s;ands of years beyond the Truth. Neverthele&s;s they them&s;elves acknowledge that their Hi&s;tory has the &s;emblance of a Fable in whatever precedes the beginning of their Monarchy; but it has been hitherto difficult to per&s;wade them that they had not had a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kings before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> which remounts be|yond the time where our common Chronology places the flood: in&s;omuch that &s;everal among&s;t the Mi&s;&s;ionaries have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to the Chronology of the <HI>Septuagint,</HI> according to which the Deluge is more an|cient by &s;everal Ages, than according to the common Chronology. What render'd the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory more probable, is, that under every King it re|cords the Eclip&s;es, and other cele&s;tial <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of his Reign: but <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> having examined the time of a Conjunction of the Planets, which they place under their <HI>fifth</HI> King, he has found it above 500 years later than their Hi|&s;tory makes it: and he proves this very mi&s;reckoning of 500 years by another A&s;tronomical remark, referred to the Reign of their <HI>&s;eventh</HI> King. Thus the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Monarchy appears le&s;s ancient by 500 years than the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> have thought, and it may be pre&s;umed that in this &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kings, which they give us, they have put tho&s;e who have reigned at the &s;ame time in diver&s;e Pro|vinces of <HI>China,</HI> when it was divided into &s;everal little Feudatary States under the &s;ame Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> having given me his Reflexions upon this &s;ubject, I have thought fit to add them here, and once again to adorn my work with a Chap|ter after his fancy. And becau&s;e he has communicated unto me a thought which he had about the &s;itution of the <HI>Taprobane</HI> of the Ancients, I have be|&s;ought him to give it me: whatever re&s;pects the <HI>Indies</HI> being not improper in this Book, and whatever comes from <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> being always well recei|ved by all.</P>

<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> The Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe years of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> are luni&s;olar, &s;ome of which are Common of 12 lunar Months, others Emboli&s;mick of 13.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day of the month is ordinarily the fir&s;t day after the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, &s;o that the Eclip&s;es of the Sun do ordinarily hap|pen the la&s;t day of the month, as may be &s;een in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Chronology of Father <HI>Couplet.</HI></P>
<P>If the beginnings of the months do remove from this <HI>Epooha</HI> of the Con|junctions, it is ea&s;ie to re&s;tore them after the ob&s;ervation of an Eclip&s;e of the Sun.</P>
<P>The order of the Common and Emboli&s;mick years, is regulated by the Cy|cle of 60 years, in which 22 are Emboli&s;mick, and the others Common.</P>
<P>According to Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory, the years at the Moons Conjunction with the Sun, the neare&s;t the fifteenth degree of <HI>Aquarius:</HI> that is to &s;ay, the point of the Zodiack which is at equal di&s;tances from the points of the Winter Sol&s;tice, and of the Vernal Equinox: which according to this Au|thor has been ob&s;erved from the twenty fifth Age before the Birth of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> to the pre&s;ent Age: tho this beginning has varied according to the will of diver&s;e Emperors, and that they have been obliged &s;ometimes to correct the year, from the Errors which were crept therein.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="141">There may be more error in the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the years, than in the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the months, becau&s;e that the points of the Zodiack, which determine the fir&s;t month of the year, are not immediately vi&s;ible, as the Eclip&s;es of the Sun, which determine the beginnings of the months.</P>
<P>It is certain, as Father <HI>Martinius</HI> remarks, that after a period of 60 luni&s;olar years, the Conjunctions of the Moon with the Sun return not to the &s;ame point of the Zodiack, but that they anticipate three degrees, which the Sun runs through only in three days, which in ten periods of 60 years amount to 30 days. Thus to hinder the beginning of the year from removing above a Sign from the fifteenth degree of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> it would be nece&s;&s;ary that the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> &s;hould add to every period of 600 years a month extraordinary, above the 22 months which are added to every period of 60 years. Yet Father <HI>Martini|us</HI> relates that they have no need of any intercalation: which I &s;uppo&s;e it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand of the&s;e three days apart, but not of the extraordinary in|tercalations of the months, when this difference of three days is mounted to an whole month.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Doubts upon the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Chronology.</HEAD>
<P>BUt it is not known whether this be regularly practi&s;ed, or whether the <HI>Chi|ne&s;es</HI> do add &s;ome months extraordinary to their years without rule, when they perceive that the beginning of the year is too remote from the middle of <HI>Aquarius;</HI> and whether the Intercalations of the months, as well ordinary as extraordinary, are made on purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>We have rea&s;on to doubt of what Father <HI>Couplet,</HI> who has been a long time in <HI>China,</HI> &s;ays in his Treati&s;e of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Chronology, that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> begin their years at the Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun the neare&s;t the fifth degree of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> which mu&s;t be &s;o at pre&s;ent: So that from Father <HI>Martini|us</HI> to the pre&s;ent <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> years, they would have run back 30 degrees.</P>
<P>If the Ob&s;ervation related by Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his &s;eventh Book of his <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> was true, the beginning of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> year would be &s;everal Signs di|&s;tant from the fifteenth degree of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> &s;ince the time that this degree has been a&s;&s;ign'd for a middle limit of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> years: for he &s;ays that according to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;torians, who&s;e credit he &s;u&s;pects, the 204^t^h year before the <HI>Epo|cha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in the beginning of the year, five Planets appeared in the Con&s;tellation of <HI>Cing,</HI> which at pre&s;ent extends from the beginning of <HI>Cancer</HI> to the beginning of <HI>Leo,</HI> and then con&s;equently extended from the 4^t^h or 5^t^h of <HI>Ge|mini</HI> to the &s;ame degrees of <HI>Cancer.</HI> It may be &s;een without any other calcula|tion, that this ob&s;ervation agrees not to the Sy&s;tem of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> years: for &s;eeing that <HI>Mercury</HI> removes not from the Sun above 28 degrees, nor <HI>Venus</HI> above 48; it is certain that <HI>Venus</HI> could not be in the Con&s;tellation <HI>Cing,</HI> before that the Sun had pa&s;&s;ed half of the Sign <HI>Aries,</HI> which is two whole Signs di&s;tant from the middle of <HI>Aquarius;</HI> and that <HI>Mercury</HI> could not appear in this Con|&s;tellation unle&s;s the Sun had pa&s;&s;ed the beginning of <HI>Taurus,</HI> and becau&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary that at lea&s;t one of the&s;e two Planets &s;hould appear in this Con&s;tella|tion to accompli&s;h the number of five, or both, if the Moon meet not therein: (for the Sun in this <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> could not be there) it is certain that the Sun could not be le&s;s remote from the middle of <HI>Aquarius</HI> than two whole Signs in the be|ginning of the year, at which this Conjunction is marked. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi|&s;tory remarks al&s;o, that at &s;everal times there is found &s;ome digre&s;&s;ions in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> years, which have obliged &s;everal Emperors to re&s;tore them to the fir&s;t <HI>Epocha.</HI> The&s;e digre&s;&s;ions may have happened for having intercalated the months too frequently, or for having neglected the intercalations of the months when it was nece&s;&s;ary to make them, and as we have not the Hi&s;tory of the&s;e intercalations, it is not po&s;&s;ible to remove the perplexities which there is, for this cau&s;e, in the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Chronology.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="142">It is known what has been that of the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> in this very age: for notwith|&s;tanding the Antiquity of their magnificent Ob&s;ervatories, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of In&s;truments, and the ample Colledges and Governments of A&s;tronomy, this Nation &s;o very jealous of its own Glory, and an Enemy to Strangers, has been obliged to joyn with its A&s;tronomers for the correction of their Calender, the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> which went thither to introduce a Religion contrary to theirs, and to heap Honors on the Fathers <HI>Licci, Schall, Verbiest,</HI> and <HI>Grimaldi,</HI> who in the time of his ab&s;ence in <HI>Italy,</HI> was elected by the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> for Pre&s;i|dent of A&s;tronomy. From whence it may be judged that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> had not &s;o certain a method of regulating their years, that they have owned, that they are not capable of regulating them all alone without great Errors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>III.</HI> An ancient Ob&s;ervation of the meeting of the Planets in the Con&s;tellation <HI>Xe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FAther <HI>Martinius</HI> attributes to the fifth Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> whom he reports to have reigned from the year 2513 to the 2435^t^h year before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the rule of beginning the year with the new Moon neare&s;t the 15 of <HI>Aquarius.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ays that, according to the Author of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory, this Emperor &s;aw five Planets joyned together on the &s;ame day of the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon in the Con&s;tellation <HI>Xe,</HI> which at pre&s;ent begins about the eighteenth degree of the Sign <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> and extends to the fourth degree of <HI>Aries,</HI> and that he took this day for the beginning of the year.</P>
<P>He relates not in what year of his Reign the Conjunction of the Planets was: but as this Conjunction is very rare, we may &s;earch whether it could happen between the 2513 and 2435^t^h year before <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> in this Con&s;tellation of <HI>Xe.</HI></P>
<P>This re&s;earch is important, fora&s;much as this <HI>Epocha</HI> would be &s;everal Ages ancienter than the Deluge, according to the calculation of tho&s;e who place it about 2200 years between the Deluge and the Birth of <HI>Je&s;us Christ.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> Of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Con&s;tellations.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the under&s;tanding of this Cele&s;tial Character, we have examined the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Con&s;tellations, of which <HI>Martinius</HI> in his Hi&s;tory and in his <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Atlas gives the Catalogue calculated for the year 1628, after the <HI>European</HI> me|thod, and we have compared them with our Con&s;tellations calculated for the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>We have found by this compari&s;on, that every <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Con&s;tellation begins ordinarily with &s;ome con&s;iderable fixed Star, which in the year 1628 is found in <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Catalogue almo&s;t always in the &s;ame minute, as the beginning of the corre&s;ponding Con&s;tellation in the two Catalogues of Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> except 3 or 4, in which it appears, that there is a mi&s;take of numbers in the two Ca|talogues, where the di&s;tance taken from the point of the Equinox, accords not with the degrees and minutes of the Sign of the Zodiac, to which the&s;e Con|&s;tellations are referred, as it agrees in the other Con&s;tellations.</P>
<P>Wherefore we do here in&s;ert them after two ways, according to the num|bers of Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> and according to our correction.</P>

<P>This agreement of the numbers of the&s;e Tables with tho&s;e of <HI>Tycho,</HI> almo&s;t in the &s;ame minute, gave me ground to imagine that the&s;e Tables have been calculated by the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> who went about an Age &s;ince to <HI>China,</HI> and not by the <HI>Chine&s;es.</HI> For what probability is there, that without being drawn from <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Tables they &s;hould be &s;o conformable thereto? Our A&s;tronomers of this Age find difficulty to agree in the &s;ame minute in the place of the fixed Stars: and it is known that between the Catalogues of <HI>Tycho,</HI> ane that of the <HI>Land|grave</HI> of <HI>He&s;&s;e,</HI> made at the &s;ame time by excellent A&s;tronomers, there is a difference of &s;everal minutes. Wherefore it is not very probable that the Ob&s;ervations of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> &s;hould agree almo&s;t always with the Ob&s;ervati|ons of <HI>Tycho</HI> in the &s;ame minute.</P>

<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> The Method of terminating the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Con&s;tellations at any time.</HEAD>
<P>FAther <HI>Martinius</HI> remarks, that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do determine the Longitude in the Heaven by the Poles of the World; that is to &s;ay by great Circles drawn through the Poles perpendicular to the Equinoxial, where we denote the right a&s;cen&s;ions of the Stars. Therefore the &s;tars which are between two Circles, that do pa&s;s through the Poles, and through the two fixed Stars which terminate a con&s;tellation, relate to that very con&s;tellation.</P>
<P>But it appears by the compari&s;on of the two preceding Tables, that the longi|tudes are not &s;et down differently in the Table of Father <HI>Martinius</HI> from what they are noted in <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Table, which reduces the Stars to the Ecliptick, and not to the Equinoxial. They are not therefore &s;et down after the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> man|ner; but to reduce them after the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> method, it is nece&s;&s;ary to refer the Stars which are at the beginning of every con&s;tellation to the Equinoxial, and to find their right a&s;cen&s;ions, and the points of the Zodiack which &s;hall have the &s;ame right a&s;cen&s;ions, will be at the beginning of the&s;e con&s;tellations.</P>
<P>When a Star falls in the <HI>Colure</HI> of the Sol&s;tices, as the foot of <HI>Gemini</HI> in that Table where begins the con&s;tellation <HI>Cing,</HI> there is no difference between its longitude after our manner, and its right a&s;cen&s;ion, which is the longitude after the <HI>Chine&s;e;</HI> but as the Stars remove from the <HI>Colure</HI> of the Sol&s;tices, the difference of their longitudes and of their right a&s;cen&s;ions augments &s;o much more, as the latitudes or declinations of the Stars are greater. And becau&s;e that the fixed Stars remove continually from one <HI>Colure</HI> and approach the other by a motion parallel to the Ecliptick, and oblique to the Equinoxial, this diffe|rence varies continually, and otherwi&s;e more con&s;tellation than in another: whence it happens that from one Age to the other the &s;ame <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> con&s;tellati|on determined by two fixed Stars enlarges, or contracts, and comprehends not always the &s;ame number of fixed Stars.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="143">Therefore to know in what <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> con&s;tellation a Planet falls at a certain time, it is nece&s;&s;ary to find for this time the right a&s;cen&s;ion of the Planet, and the right a&s;cen&s;ion of the fixed Stars adjoyning, which determine the beginning and end of the Con&s;tellations; which we &s;hould not have known without the reflexion which we have made, that every Con&s;tellation begins with a certain fixed Star, and without the advice which Father <HI>Martinius</HI> gives us, that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> longitudes are taken from the Poles of the world, that is to &s;ay, diffe|rently from what they are &s;et down in this Table.</P>
<P>It appears by this Table, that the Con&s;tellation <HI>Xe</HI> here treated of, begins with the fir&s;t of the Wing of <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> and ends with the la&s;t of the &s;ame Wing, &s;eeing that according to the &s;econd Column of this very Table, this Con&s;tella|tion began in the year 1628, at 18 degrees and 20 minutes of <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> where we find at the &s;ame year the fir&s;t of the Wing by <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Table reduced to the &s;ame time; tho the fir&s;t Column of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Table gives two degrees le&s;s, which is doubtle&s;s an error of the impre&s;&s;ion or calculation, which has crept into the two works of Father <HI>Martinius.</HI></P>
<P>The Originals of the Tables of <HI>Tycho</HI> and <HI>Longimontanus</HI> do likewi&s;e give the la&s;t of the Wing at 4 degrees and a minute of <HI>Aries,</HI> where ends the Con&s;tella|tion <HI>Xe,</HI> and where begins the following Con&s;tellation <HI>Pi,</HI> though the <HI>Rodolphine</HI> and <HI>Philolaick</HI> Tables with tho&s;e of Father <HI>Ricciolus</HI> do &s;how the &s;ame Star at 4 degrees of <HI>Pi&s;ces,</HI> which certainly is an error of the Tran&s;cribers, which is &s;lipt into the works of the&s;e A&s;tronomers. As the&s;e two Stars have a great Nor|thern longitude, the fir&s;t being 19 degrees and 26 minutes, the &s;econd 12 de|grees and 35 minutes; the difference between their longitude and their right a&s;cen&s;ion, which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> take for longitude, is con&s;iderable at pre&s;ent, for|a&s;much as the&s;e Stars are near the <HI>Colure</HI> of the Equinoxes, where this diffe|rence is greater than el&s;ewhere. But it was not &s;o con&s;iderable anciently, when the&s;e Stars were near the <HI>Colure</HI> of the Sol&s;tices.</P>

<P>HAving reduced the&s;e Stars to the Equinoxial in the twenty fourth and twen|ty fifth Age before the Birth of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> we have not found, that be|tween the Circles of the declinations which pa&s;s through the&s;e Stars, five Pla|nets could be found joyned together, neither in the&s;e Ages, nor in two others before and after, whil&s;t that the Sun was in the &s;ign of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> as the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory imports.</P>
<P>But we have found that <HI>Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Mercury,</HI> and the <HI>Moon</HI> met in that <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> con&s;tellation determined by this method, the Sun being in the 20^t^h of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> in the 2012 year before the <HI>Epocha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the 26^t^h of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> according to the <HI>Julian,</HI> the 9^t^h according to the <HI>Gregorian</HI> form, which runs at pre&s;ent, and that the day following 10/27 of <HI>February</HI> at 6 a Clock in the morning at <HI>China,</HI> happen'd the conjunction of the Moon with the Sun, which may be that which was taken as the <HI>Epocha</HI> of the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> years.</P>

<HEAD><HI>VII.</HI> An Ancient Ob&s;ervation of a Winter Sol&s;tice made at <HI>China.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THis difference of five Age whereby it appears according to this calculation, that the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> do make their <HI>Epocha</HI> too antient, is confirmed by ano|ther place of Father <HI>Martinius</HI> his Hi&s;tory, where this Author reports that un|der <HI>Jao</HI> the &s;eventh Emperor of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> the Winter Sol&s;tice was ob&s;erved about the fir&s;t degree of the con&s;tellation <HI>Hiu,</HI> which at pre&s;ent begins about the 18^t^h of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> &s;o that &s;ince this time the Sol&s;tice is removed above 48 degrees from its fir&s;t place; he refers this Ob&s;ervation to the 20^t^h year of <HI>Jao,</HI> which he reports to have been the 2341 before the Birth of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It appears by the Table that this con&s;tellation <HI>Hiu</HI> began with the Star which is in the left &s;houlder of <HI>Aquarius,</HI> which in the year 1628 was at 18 de|grees, 16 Minutes of <HI>Aquarius;</HI> but the 20^t^h year of <HI>Jao</HI> it was in 29 degrees of <HI>Sagitarius</HI> and &s;ome minutes, &s;eeing that the Winter Sol&s;tice, which is al|ways at the beginning of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> was at the fir&s;t of the con&s;tellation <HI>Hiu.</HI> The di&s;tance between the&s;e two places of the Zodiac is 49 degrees 16 minutes, which the fixed Stars according to <HI>Tycho</HI>'s Table do make in 3478 years, by rea|&s;on of 51 &s;econds <HI>per annum:</HI> from whence having deducted 1625 years at mo&s;t, which are elap&s;ed from the <HI>Epocha</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the 20^t^h of <HI>Jao</HI> would be the 1852 year before the Birth of <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> which Father <HI>Martinius</HI> according to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory placeth in the 2347^t^h year before <HI>Je&s;us Christ,</HI> making it more antient by about 497 years. Thus there are about 5 Ages difference be|tween this <HI>Epocha</HI> taken from the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Hi&s;tory, and the &s;ame drawn from the motion of the fixed Stars made in this interval of time, as we have found by the Examination of the Ob&s;ervation of the 5 Planets in the Con&s;tellation <HI>Xe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>According to Father</HI> Martinius <HI>in the beginning of his History of</HI> China, <HI>it &s;eems that the</HI> Chine&s;es <HI>do reckon but five Planets,</HI> Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, <HI>and</HI> Mer|cury, <HI>and that they &s;uppo&s;e at the time of their fifth Emperor, the concour&s;e of tho&s;e five Planets in the Con&s;tellation</HI> Xe, <HI>on the &s;ame day that there was a Conjunction of the Moon with the Sun. But if this</HI> Chine&s;e <HI>ob&s;ervation mu&s;t be thus under&s;tood, 'twould be a meer groundle&s;s mi&s;take: &s;uch a concour&s;e having not happened at the time denoted by the</HI> Chi|ne&s;es, <HI>nor long before it, &s;o that it cannot be known perhaps how to take it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Hi&s;torians &s;upported with A&s;tronomical Ob&s;ervations, do merit therefore to be ex|amined beforc that credit be given thereunto. Thus an account of Eclip&s;es, which is at the beginning of</HI> Diogenes Laertius, <HI>and which he relates after</HI> Sotion, <HI>is condemned as fal&s;e by Mon&s;ieur</HI> Ca&s;&s;ini. Sotion <HI>reckoned</HI> 48863 <HI>years between</HI> Vulcan <HI>and</HI> Alexander <HI>the</HI> Great, <HI>and in this interval he placed</HI> 373 <HI>&s;olar Eclip&s;es, and</HI> 832 <HI>lunar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A too ready belief mu&s;t not likewi&s;e be given to an History, becau&s;e it gives us a well ranged &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Kings. The</HI> Per&s;ians <HI>do give us one of this Nature, which we know to be full of fal&s;ities: and we have the Genealogies of our Kings from</HI> Adam, <HI>which are yet more &s;purious. 'Tis not only from a well adjusted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, that the Hi&s;tories to which we give credit, do take their certainty, but from that they are confirmed one by the other: All the Nations that can have a knowledge of the &s;ame things, relating them after the &s;ame man|ner, at lea&s;t as to the mo&s;t important circum&s;tances, &s;o that where there is a diver&s;ity of

advice we fall into doubt. The Hi&s;tory of the</HI> Chine&s;es <HI>has neither been contradicted, nor confirmed by their Neighbours: no Authority can be drawn from their &s;ilence; and thus all that we have to do, is to believe it true in the gro&s;s, e&s;pecially from about</HI> 200 <HI>years before Je&s;us Chri&s;t; but not in what oppugns our Hi&s;tories, which are better atte&s;ted than theirs.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Concerning the I&s;le <HI>Taprobane,</HI> by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ituation of the I&s;le <HI>Taprobane,</HI> according to <HI>Ptolomy</HI> in the &s;eventh Book of his Geography, was over again&s;t the Promontary <HI>Cari.</HI></P>
<P>This Promontary is placed by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> between the Rivers <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> nearer <HI>Indus</HI> than the <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;le <HI>Taprobane</HI> was divided by the Equinoxial Line into two unequal parts, the greate&s;t of which was in the Northern Hemi&s;phere, extending to 12 or 13 degrees of Northern Latitude. The lea&s;t part was in the Southern Hemi&s;phere, extending to two degrees and a half of Southern Latitude.</P>
<P>Round about this I&s;land there were 1378 little I&s;les, among which there were 19 more con&s;iderable, the name of which was known in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>The Promontory <HI>Cory</HI> could be no other than that, which is at pre&s;ent called <HI>Comori,</HI> or <HI>Comorin,</HI> which is al&s;o between the <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> nearer the <HI>Indus</HI> than the <HI>Ganges.</HI></P>
<P>Over again&s;t this Cape there is not at pre&s;ent &s;o great an I&s;le as <HI>Taprobane,</HI> which could be divided by the Equinoxial, and environed with 1378 I&s;les: but there is a multitude of little I&s;les, called <HI>Maldivae,</HI> which the Inhabitants re|port to be to the number of 12 Thou&s;and. According to the Relation of <HI>Pi|rard,</HI> who lived there five years, the&s;e I&s;les have a King, who a&s;&s;umes to him|&s;elf the Title of King of 13 Provinces, and 12 Thou&s;and I&s;les.</P>
<P>Every one of the&s;e thirteen Provinces is an heap of little I&s;les, each of which is environed with a great bank of Stone, which inclo&s;es it all round like a great wall: they are called <HI>Attolons.</HI> They have each Thirty miles in circumference, a little more or le&s;s, and are of a figure almo&s;t round, or oval. They are end to end one from the other, from the North to the South; and they are &s;eparated by Channels of the Sea, &s;ome broad, others very narrow, The&s;e Stone-banks which environ every <HI>Attollon,</HI> are &s;o high, and the Sea breaks there with &s;uch an impetuo&s;ity, that they which are in the middle of an <HI>Attollon,</HI> do &s;ee the&s;e banks all round, with the Waves of the Sea which &s;eem as high as the Hou&s;es. The Inclo&s;ure of an <HI>Attollon</HI> has but 4 Avenues, two on the North-&s;ide, two others on the South-&s;ide, one of which is at the Ea&s;t, the other at the We&s;t, and the lar|ge&s;t of which is 200 paces, the narrowe&s;t &s;omewhat le&s;s than 30. At the two &s;ides of each of the&s;e Avenues there are &s;ome I&s;les, but the Currents and great Tides do daily dimini&s;h the number thereof. <HI>Pirard</HI> adds, that to &s;ee the in&s;ide of one of the&s;e <HI>Attollons,</HI> one would &s;ay that all the&s;e little I&s;les and the Channels of the Sea, which it inclo&s;es, are only a continued plain, and that it was antiently only a &s;ingle I&s;land, cut and divided afterwards into &s;everal. Every where almo&s;t is &s;een the bot|tom of the Channels, which divide them, &s;o &s;hallow they are, except in &s;ome places: and when the Sea is low, the water reaches not up to the girdle, but to the middle of the leg almo&s;t every where.</P>
<P>There is a violent and perpetual Current, which from the month of <HI>April</HI> to the month of <HI>October</HI> comes impetuou&s;ly from the We&s;t, and cau&s;es the conti|nual rains which do there make the Winter; and at the other &s;ix months the Winds are fixed from the Ea&s;t, and do bring a great heat, without any rain, which cau&s;es their Summer. At the bottom of the&s;e Channels, there are great Stones, which the Inhabitants do u&s;e to build with, and they are al&s;o &s;tored with a kind of Bu&s;hes, which re&s;emble Coral; which renders the pa&s;&s;age of the Boats through the&s;e Channels extreamly difficult.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="145"><HI>Lin&s;coten</HI> te&s;tifies that according to the <HI>Mallabars,</HI> the&s;e little I&s;les have for|merly been joyned to the firm Land, and that by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time they have been loo&s;ed thence by the Violence of the Sea, by rea&s;on of the lowne&s;s of the Land.</P>
<P>'Tis therefore probable that the <HI>Maldivae</HI> are a remainder of the great I&s;land <HI>Taprobane;</HI> and of the 1378 I&s;lands which did encompa&s;s it, which have been carryed away, or dimini&s;hed by the Currents, there remaining nothing el&s;e but the&s;e Rocks, which mu&s;t formerly be the ba&s;es of the Mountains: and what remains in the inclo&s;ure of the&s;e Rocks, where the Sea da&s;hes &s;o, that it is ca|pable only of dividing, but not of carrying away the Lands which are included within their Circuit.</P>
<P>It is certain that the&s;e I&s;les have the &s;ame &s;ituation in regard of the Equinoxi|al and Promontory, and of the Rivers <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Ganges,</HI> that <HI>Ptolomy</HI> a&s;&s;igns to &s;everal places of the I&s;le <HI>Taprobane.</HI></P>
