<P>A great Miracle AT SEA: OR, A perfect Relation of a mighty <HI>Whale,</HI> which was pur&s;ued in the Sea, and encountred by multitudes of other Fi&s;hes, As it was certified by divers Mariners of <HI>Wey|mouth</HI> Sayling from <HI>France</HI> in a Shipp called the <HI>Bonanaventure,</HI> did &s;hoot the Whale, Which making to Land (as all Whales do when they are mortally wounded) was found dead upon the Shore within three miles of <HI>Weymouth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Where the Countrey people (after many dayes labour upon this mighty fi&s;h) having opened it's belly, found a Romi&s;h Prie&s;t, with a black Box of Pardons from the Pope for many Pa|pi&s;ts in England and Ireland, who&s;e Names are here printed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A great wonder at Sea.</HEAD>
<P>THat Antichri&s;t or the Pope is the Bea&s;t of <HI>Rome,</HI> hath beene abundantly declared by all reformed Writers; but that this Bea&s;t is odious not onely to men and Creatures upon earth, but even to Fi&s;hes in the Sea this age onely can give an illuctration of it, and that in &s;uch a miraculous manner as never age can produce the like. We will de&s;cribe unto you the full manner of it, and you &s;hall have it really and plainly related as we have received the truth from many who were the pre&s;ent Spectators of this wonderfull &s;ight, and wee &s;hall de&s;ire onely from you but the gentlene&s;&s;e to receive it, and the credence to beleeve it.</P>
<P>On the 10 of <HI>October</HI> 1645 being the Lords Day, the good Shipp called <HI>The Bonaventure of Weymouth,</HI> being bound for <HI>England,</HI> was bringing home her Merchandize from <HI>France,</HI> which was Wines, Lin|nen-Cloth, and abundance of Walnuts: the day was very fair, and no winde &s;tirring, &s;o that the Ship for above three hours &s;pace lay hulling uppon the Seas, being not able to move either one way or other, for want of winde, although &s;hee was full Sayled and prepared to take the advantage of every Gale. Being put to &s;ome inconveni|ence by rea&s;on of this great Calme, the Sea-men for the pre&s;ent had nothing el&s; to do but to look about them, many of them, as the maner is at Sea, wi&s;hing rather for a Tempe&s;t, then being Wind-bound to &s;tare about them, and doe nothing, when behold not farre from them they &s;aw a mighty rowling, and working upon the water; and being amazed at the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of the &s;ight, they called unto one another, and were all come above Board, expecting what &s;hould occa&s;ion &s;o &s;trange a motion in the water, they found it to draw nearer to them, which made them the more eager to apprehend the cau&s;e, at length they perceived it to be a Whale, and that of no &s;mall proportion, but (as it were the Leviathan of the Sea) to tran&s;cend all other VVhales in length and compa&s;&s;e. The VVhale made towards the Shipp, which
<PB N="2" REF="3">put the Marriners into a great fear, being not able to get from it, but they perceived the Mon&s;ter of the &s;ea to come to them rather for re|fuge, then offence, for they &s;aw it was followed by a infinite compa|ny of other Fi&s;h, as if all the fi&s;hes of the Sea were in the pur&s;uance of it: There were to be &s;een Fi&s;hes of all &s;orts, onely the Remora was ab&s;ent, which the Sea-men afterwards conceived was got under their Ship. There was the Sword-Fi&s;h, the Thornbacke aimed with his Prickles, the faire Balena, the filthy Phocae, and &s;uch a fry of Sea-Mon&s;ters (the old ones following after) as the like was never &s;een nor can be repre&s;ented, but onely by tho&s;e men who were the Specta|tors of it. In a mo&s;t violent manner they did beat again&s;t the VVhale, making a mo&s;t hideous and fearfull noy&s;e, and falling upon her, &s;hee made what ha&s;te &s;he could to get from them: &s;ome of the&s;e fi&s;hes were in one &s;hape, and &s;ome in another, but all mo&s;t wonderfull to behold, who in great fury did u&s;e what&s;oever weapons of offence that nature had afforded them to a&s;&s;ault this VVhale: nay, many of them were &s;o eager in their fight, that they were &s;een to leap above the wa|ter, and as if they had gained an advantage of &s;trength, they did throw them&s;elves with greater rage again&s;t it, who being but one again&s;t &s;o many thou&s;ands, was not able to wir&s;tand their fury, but making a mo&s;t terrible crie, did what &s;he could to come near the Ship. On this the amazed and di&s;tracted Sea-men, fearing the VVhale &s;hould over|turn their &s;hip, and &s;o drowne them all, di&s;charged divers of their muskets again&s;t it, which it &s;eemeth took effect, for pre&s;ently they &s;aw &s;o great &s;tore of Blood that the &s;ea was much coloured, and the Whale which before &s;eemed to draw more near the Ship for a &s;afety, did now &s;teer another cour&s;e through the bloody and foaming waters. The infinite &s;hoales of fi&s;h, which in incredible numbers did follow the Whale, were no way di&s;mayed at the noi&s;e of the Muskets, nor at the fire which was given, but perceiving the wounded Whale to make a|way from the Ship, in greedy throng they pre&s;&s;ed after it.</P>
<P>This made the Sea-men to wonder more, for many of them who&s;e Names are here &s;ub&s;cribed, having been often at Sea, never beheld the like thing before, nor never &s;aw &s;uch diver&s;ity of pertentous Fi&s;hes, following troups on troups, one after another, as if they were in emu|lation who fir&s;t &s;hould exerci&s;e their greate&s;t fury and revenge upon it; Be&s;ides, they do profe&s;&s;e, that it did increa&s;e their wonder, to &s;ee this conte&s;tation which is again&s;t the u&s;uall way of nature, it being com|mon
<PB N="3" REF="3">and ordinary for the Whale to pur&s;ue other Fi&s;hes, and to devour them, and not to &s;ee a multitude of other Fi&s;hes (as if they were confederate all in one obligation) to pur&s;ue the Whale, and to do the uttermo&s;t of their endeavour to de&s;troy it. In this manner they followed the Whale, and u&s;ed what violence they could again&s;t it, as far as their eyes could reach, the &s;ea beating up and down, and the waters la|bouring as they pa&s;&s;ed through them, yet &s;till in cholerick tumults pur&s;ued the cha&s;e, leaving a great trale upon the wa|ters, which for a long way was to he &s;een as they pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this the evening coming on, the winde did begin to ri&s;e, which blowing from the South-Ea&s;t was very welcome to the Seamen, who making their be&s;t advantage of it, they came on the next morning (being Munday <HI>Octob.</HI> 20. 1645.) unto <HI>Weymouth,</HI> where they were no &s;ooner landed but they under&s;tood that a Whale of a mighty bigne&s;&s;e was ca&s;t up three miles from that place, who coming in with the Tide, and being &s;orely wounded with Musket &s;hots, did make what ha&s;te &s;he could to Land, and finding the Tyde to for&s;ake her, &s;he made a mighry roar, that the noi&s;e thereof (as the coun|trey people do report) was heard two miles from it: on the next morning &s;he was found dead, like a mighty ruine lying all along upon the &s;hore, the countrey people coming from all places in multitudes to behold it.</P>
<P>On Friday following the&s;e Sea-men (having di&s;patched their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e at Weymouth, went nine of them together in one company to &s;ee the Whale, and the rather becau&s;e they did truly conjecture it to be the &s;ame Whale which on Sun|day before they &s;aw pur&s;ued by &s;uch mon&s;trous multitudes of fi&s;hes; corceiving al&s;o, that by rea&s;on of the many wounds which &s;he received by the &s;hots from the Muskets, that &s;he made ha&s;te to the next &s;hore to dye on, for the Whale, al|though when &s;he is living will be covered with the Sea, yet
<PB N="4" REF="4">when &s;he feeleth death coming on, &s;he doth renounce that watery Element, and will admit no coverture but the wide Vault of Heaven. The&s;e mariners being come they found the Countrey-people very active in cutting up the Whale, &s;ome bu&s;ie on one part of the body, &s;ome on another, the bet|ter &s;ort &s;tanding by and wondring at the mighty compa&s;&s;e and proportion of it, and encouraging the Countrey-people to proceed in their unaccu&s;tomed work. The hone&s;t people partaked in the labour, the better &s;ort in the profit, and all in the grievou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the &s;mell, which to &s;peake the truth was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that if it be true Philo&s;ophy, that a violent &s;ubject or &s;en&s;ible doth de&s;troy the Sen&s;ory or the &s;en&s;e, it may be a que&s;tion whether the&s;e No&s;es can ever have the capacity of &s;enting any thing that is &s;weet again. Had you been there you might haue &s;een Greenland near Weymouth, &s;uch a noi&s;e and a quarter they make when they do hew the Whales in peeces in that Northern Climate, where there is but one night and one day in a whole year.</P>
<P>Their &s;trength being lo&s;t with labour, and their &s;pirits with the odious importunity of the increa&s;ing favour which pro|ceeded from the corruption of that mighty Carka&s;&s;e, they re|lieve them&s;elves (according to the accu&s;tomed practice) with the &s;trength of Hot-Waters: and now being armed again&s;t all ingredients of ill &s;avours, they di&s;tribute the fi&s;h in pre|pared Cauldrons, which by the benefit of the fire mu&s;t be im|proved into Oyle,</P>
<P>While the labourers are boyling the Fi&s;h, the Merchants are compounding for the Spelme or &s;eed thereof; and this commonly is called Parmacity, &s;ome part therof they de&s;ign to <HI>Falmouth,</HI> &s;ome part to <HI>Exeter,</HI> &s;ome part to <HI>Weymouth,</HI> and very like &s;ome part to <HI>Bri&s;toll</HI> and <HI>London:</HI></P>
<P>The belly of this Whale being opened, and the va&s;t Ribs being taken a&s;under there was di&s;covered in the Bowels of
<PB N="5" REF="4">it a man, who it &s;eemes had not long lain buried, his head was &s;haven, he was &s;ure|ly &s;ome Prie&s;t, and the hair on his Crown &s;ince his death was not much grown.</P>
<P>They found al&s;o with this man a black Box made of Lether, wherein were divers Pardons for &s;everall Papi&s;ts now in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and in <HI>Ireland,</HI> as for <HI>Iohn Flower</HI> and <HI>Humphrey Vaux</HI>] in <HI>England</HI> (it is thought that this <HI>Vaux</HI> is of kin to <HI>Guido Vaux,</HI> who indeavoured to have blown up the Par|liament Hou&s;e in the yeare 1605.) Al&s;o many Pardons for Papi&s;ts in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who have laboured to the uttermo&s;t of their endeavours to blow it up again, as to one <HI>Pre&s;ton,</HI> the &s;ame who is now expected to come over into <HI>England</HI> with Forces; al&s;o an exhortation to him to proceed in the Wars he had undertaken, with a&s;&s;urance of the benediction of his Holine&s;&s;e. A Pardon for one <HI>Muskerry,</HI> a Pardon for one <HI>Oneal,</HI> for <HI>Mac Magennis,</HI> and one for divers others, which was read by a Scholler, who
<PB N="6" REF="5">was then pre&s;ent, as tho&s;e Sea-men have affirmed, but being them&s;elves but unex|perienced men in Letters, they are &s;orry they cannot deliver the particulars &s;o ful|ly as they de&s;ire.</P>
<P>It may evidently appear, that the rea&s;on why the&s;e multitudes of Fi&s;hes before re|lated did &s;o pro&s;ecute this Whale, was by rea&s;on of the per&s;on in its Belly, who it &s;eemes was ca&s;t into the &s;ea by &s;ome &s;hip|wrack, and then &s;wallowed by this great Whale.</P>
