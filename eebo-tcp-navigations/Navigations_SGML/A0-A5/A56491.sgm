<P>MAjor-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> with the Suc|cours for <HI>Ireland</HI> under his Com|mand, &s;et Sail from <HI>Liverpool</HI> for <HI>London-Derry</HI> the 21st. In&s;tant, the Wind at E. N. E. but the Wind vering more Northerly, they were upon the 24th. forced back to a place, called <HI>High Lake,</HI> where they waited for a fair Wind.</P>
<P>On Friday Night arrived at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> an Emi|nent Officer of the Garri&s;on of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> with an Expre&s;s to His Maje&s;ty from the Pro|te&s;tants in that place. In his Pa&s;&s;age he went on Board Major-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> to whom he gave a full Account of the Condition of the Garri&s;on, and of the late&s;t Actions on both &s;ides, which according to the be&s;t and true&s;t Relations, are as follow.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Officers being extreamly Zealous in the Service, and the Emulation for Honour between both Parties being no le&s;s, they have during the time of the Siege been hotly forward and valorous in expo&s;ing their Per&s;ons; by which unlucky Conte&s;t of theirs, they have lo&s;t a con&s;idera|ble Number of experienced and good Officers. So that it is certain the Flower of their Army is in a manner quite de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>As to Particulars, it is credibly Reported, That having for &s;ome days play'd their Mor|ters, charg'd with &s;mall Bombs, into the City, though with very little damage to the Be&s;ieged, the Be&s;iegers were drawn into a Fatal Incon|venience by the Policy of the Commanders of the Garri&s;on. For the Governours being in|formed by their Spies, that the Enemy were a&s;&s;ured of the great Mi&s;chief they had done the Town, to confirm them in that belief, and to encourage them to make an A&s;&s;ault, in pur&s;uance of the Advantage which they thought they had got, ordered all the Straw and com|bu&s;tible &s;tuff that could be &s;pared in the Town, to be brought to the Walls, and &s;o placed, as not to endanger the Hou&s;es when &s;et on fire. They al&s;o farther ordered all the Stones, which were before the Pavements of the Streets, to be lodg'd upon the Walls, together with a &s;ufficient quantity of great and &s;mall Shot, and other Warlike Preparations proper to re|pel a General A&s;&s;ault, and that all Per&s;ons &s;hould be in a readine&s;s upon the Approach of the Enemy.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Be&s;iegers believing their Bombs had taken good Effect, continued throwing them, in hopes of further Execution. On the other &s;ide, the Prote&s;tants &s;et all their Combu&s;tible Matter on fire, which rai&s;ed a great Flame, and not only heightned the Con|ceit of the Be&s;iegers, as done by their Bombs, but, as the Wind then &s;ate, drave the Smoak into the Camp of the Be&s;iegers. However, notwith&s;tanding that di&s;advantage, &s;o confident they were of the &s;ucce&s;s of their Bombs, that they advanced to the Walls, and with as great Fury as they were numerous, began the A&s;|&s;ault. But to their A&s;toni&s;hment and Confu|&s;ion, they were received with &s;uch an unex|pected Bravery, that &s;everal hundreds of their be&s;t Men were kill'd in Scaling the Walls; which was &s;uch an Encouragement to the Be|&s;ieged, that at the &s;ame time Sallying out of the Garri&s;on, they took, as is Reported, the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> Pri&s;oner, 27 Inferiour Offi|cers, 5 Field-Pieces, and one Morter, with &s;everal other Arms, and had the Plunder of the Field for &s;everal Miles, with a very incon&s;ide|rable Lo&s;s to the Be&s;ieged; who the two next days, that is to &s;ay, Tue&s;day and Wedne&s;day, the 14th. and 15th. In&s;tant, made two brisk Sallies upon the rally'd <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who&s;e Out-Guards lay at the di&s;tance of more than twice Cannon|&s;hot from the City, waiting for the la&s;t Rein|forcement which was &s;ent them from <HI>Dublin.</HI></P>
<P>The Governours have &s;ent the Be&s;iegers a
<PB N="2" REF="2">Me&s;&s;age by one of their own Party, who was taken Pri&s;oner, That if they u&s;e any Violence or Cruelty to &s;uch of the Prote&s;tants as may be under ther Power or &s;hoot any more Bombs into the Town, they will not only hang up the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and &s;uch other Pri&s;oners as they have in their Cu&s;tody, but all that they &s;hall afterwards take.</P>
<P>From <HI>Dublin</HI> we are inform'd, that there are &s;trange Divi&s;ions in their pretended Par|liament there; for that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Members, perceiving the late King's De&s;igns to &s;ubject them to the <HI>French,</HI> with all the Eloquence and Speeches they can make, oppo&s;e the De|&s;igns of their pretended Soveraign. So that it is hoped that in a &s;hort time the Eyes of the ve|ry Papi&s;ts in <HI>Ireland</HI> will be opened, to &s;ee the mi&s;chievous De&s;igns of their pretended King to en&s;lave them to a Foreign and Tyrannick Power.</P>

<HEAD>An <HI>ACCOUNT</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Courage of <HI>Robert Ca&s;ton.</HI> Ma&s;ter of a Small Ve&s;&s;el, that Engaged Two <HI>French</HI> Privateers. With the Parti|cular of that Action.</HEAD>
<P>ON Thur&s;day, <HI>May</HI> the 16th. 1689. <HI>Robert Ca&s;ton</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Richard</HI>'s <HI>Advice</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> Burthen 400 Tuns, &s;ailed from <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> in Company of about 20 Sail more Loaden Colliers for <HI>London;</HI> and on Sa|turday following, off of <HI>Foulne&s;s,</HI> were met by two <HI>Dunkirk</HI> Pickeroons, one of 18 Guns, and 130 Men, the other of 4 Guns, and 55 Men, who, as the Pri&s;oners confe&s;s, having made the Fleet, re&s;olved to attaque and carry this <HI>Ca&s;ton</HI>'s Ship, as being Admiral, promi&s;ing them&s;elves all the re&s;t ea&s;ily, and accordingly came up with her to Rights. <HI>Ca&s;ton</HI> had but 6 Guns, his Son, 11 Men, one Gentleman, and three Gentlewomen Pa&s;&s;engers, and thro' fear de&s;erted by his Con&s;ort, (who promi&s;ed to &s;tand by him) all the re&s;t having no Guns, &s;tood away as fa&s;t as they could, and were by his Fight &s;aved. The Pickeroons poured in their great Shot, and Boarded him three times with a great number of Men, and as often were beat off, and the Decks cleared by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Small-&s;hot and Courage; in&s;omuch, that the <HI>French</HI> &s;eeing their Men drop &s;o fa&s;t, and very much di&s;abled in their Hulls, threw in two Granadoes into the Round-hou&s;e, where the Ma&s;ter and two Men more were, but re|ceived little hurt, though they burnt and broke. The Engagement continued from One a Clock in the Afternoon until Four, when the <HI>French</HI> &s;eeing no hopes of carrying her, &s;heered off, leaving behind them on board the Collier, Swords, Cuttle-axes, Muskets, Pi&s;tols, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as al&s;o two of their Men (now Pri&s;oners) one a <HI>Dane,</HI> the other an <HI>O&s;tender,</HI> and divers of their Men dead, and hanging on the Stays and Sides of the Ship, and bore away for <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> whence Advice is &s;ince come, that the bigge&s;t was &s;o di&s;abled, that they had great difficulty to get her into Port, and pre&s;ently to take out her Guns, to keep her above Water; and that they lo&s;t in the Fight the afore-mentioned two Pri&s;oners, 20 kill'd out-right, and 12 wound|ed, &s;ome Mortally.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter received a &s;light Wound with a Splinter in his left Leg, and a &s;mall Brui&s;e on his Thigh, his Son a Wound in his Face, and two of his Men hurt, but none of them dan|gerous.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;&s;enger had the Misfortune from the very fir&s;t Broad-&s;ide, to have his Leg &s;ore broke and &s;hatter'd, as not to be able to make any Defence; his Name was <HI>Charles Rogers,</HI> and taken on Board at <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI> So &s;oon as the Fight was over, the Ma&s;ter in three hours got into <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> where he got the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of three the mo&s;t able Chirurgeons could be had, to dre&s;s Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> of his Wounds; but they were all of Opinion, the only means left in probability to &s;ave his Life, was to cut off his Leg, which they did, but he dyed &s;oon after it, and was decently buried at <HI>Yarmouth</HI> at the Charge of the Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Rogers</HI> being a Stranger to the Ma&s;ter, and all in the Ship, it's thought fit to add to this Relation, as follows.</P>
<P>There was found in his Pocket a Certificate from one <HI>Thomas Creed,</HI> Dated the 30 of <HI>De|cember,</HI> 1687. Te&s;tifying, That <HI>Charles Rogers</HI> &s;erved him Eight Years very faithfully, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Al&s;o a Pa&s;s, in the words following.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<P><HI>THe&s;e are to Certifie, That</HI> Charles Rogers, <HI>a Gentleman, Riding in my Troop, in the Honourable Col.</HI> Edward Villers <HI>Regiment, at his own Reque&s;t is di&s;charged the Service, in Or|der to his better Preferment. Given under my Hand the</HI> 11th. <HI>of</HI> May, 1689.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>FR. ROGERS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>On Saturday la&s;t the Ma&s;ter brought his Ship up the River to <HI>New Crane,</HI> where &s;he now lies, and the two Pri&s;oners on Board him.</P>
<P>The Honour this brave Ma&s;ter hath done to his Country and to his Profe&s;&s;ion, will, no doubt, not only meet with a &s;uitable Reward and Encouragement from the Government, but a grateful Acknowledgment from tho&s;e Own|ers and Freighters, who by his, and his hand|ful of Men's Courage, had their Properties re&s;cued out of the hands of the Cowardly Enemies.</P>
