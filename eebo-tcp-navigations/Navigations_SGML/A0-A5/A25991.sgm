<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT Of the State of The French Fleet, Their Number of Men of War &amp; Fire&s;hips, And the Fortifications that are making on their Coa&s;t, For fear of an <HI>Inva&s;ion from England.</HI> In a LETTER from a French Merchant at St. <HI>Martins,</HI> to his Friend at <HI>London, July</HI> 9. New Stile. 1689.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P><HI>Licen&s;ed,</HI> <DATE>July 12. 1689.</DATE></P>
</HEADNOTE>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR Fortifications are almo&s;t fini&s;hed, all the Platforms in the Cittadel, as well as tho&s;e of the City, are all in a good Po&s;ture, with a good Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday arrived in this Road a Bark from <HI>Brest,</HI> where &s;he hath left our Fleet in that Bay or Road, con|&s;i&s;ting of Forty Two great Ships, be&s;ides &s;mall Frigats, and Twenty Five Fire-&s;hips; and we are fitting &s;till el&s;e-where; but how they will be provided with a &s;ufficient number of Sea-men to man them, I cannot tell.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Tourville,</HI> the Thirteenth pa&s;t, Sailed from <HI>Thoulon</HI> with Twenty Two Sail of Capital Ships, and Eight Fire-&s;hips, and is every day expected at <HI>Brest.</HI></P>
<P>The Mare&s;chal <HI>D'E&s;trees</HI> is at <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> and is to go on Board the Fleet, intending to Sail the Fifteenth, to &s;eek out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets, in order to Fight them: So that we are in expectation to hear of a bloody Engagement. But others &s;ay, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>De Seignaly</HI> goes on Board him&s;elf to Command, and not Mare&s;chal <HI>D' E&s;trees.</HI></P>
<P>We have no Ships left at <HI>Rochefort</HI> (all are fitted out that were there) except one Fire-&s;hip, which waits for a Wind, and &s;ome Fly-boats, who have Four or Five Hundred Men on Board them, for the u&s;e of the Fleet.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>I was at <HI>Rochel</HI> Four or Five Days ago, and viewed all the Fortifi|cations of that Place, which are very forward, and in a po&s;ture of De|fence. They have de&s;troyed many Families there, as well as here, by pulling their Hou&s;es down to the Ground; that are near the Walls.</P>
<P>We build a Fort at <HI>Bloody-Point,</HI> which is al&s;o in a great forward|ne&s;s; and we talk of building a great one at the <HI>Martreay,</HI> and other Fortifications about the Gates. But I &s;ee no likelihood of fear this Summer.</P>
<P>They have cau&s;ed to march within this Five or Six Days from <HI>Rochel,</HI> towards <HI>Saumeure,</HI> Five or Six Thou&s;and Men, and brought in their room &s;ome new Souldiers, rai&s;ed by the Pari&s;hes, within this Three or Four Months, who are to be Di&s;ciplined, and &s;upply their Places in the Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Fortifications of <HI>Oleroon</HI> are fini&s;hed, and they have pulled down all the Hou&s;es in the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>They work likewi&s;e very hard upon the Fortifications at <HI>Brouage, Rochfort,</HI> and the <HI>Sheath,</HI> which is the entrance of the River of <HI>Sher|rant.</HI></P>
<P>A Bark is arrived in <HI>Brittany</HI> &s;ince the Twenty Third pa&s;t, from <HI>Ireland,</HI> which brings Advice, That <HI>London Derry</HI> holds out &s;till, to our great admiration, that it hath not been relieved or taken all this while.</P>
<P>If once our Fleet returns into our Ports, it will be very difficult to put it to Sea again: For all things are wanting at <HI>Rochefort,</HI> and the Stores as empty as a <HI>Tennis-Court.</HI> And it's &s;aid it is the &s;ame at <HI>Brest.</HI></P>
<P>The Rendevouz of all the <HI>French</HI> Fleet is de&s;ign'd to be at <HI>Belle I&s;le,</HI> not far from the mouth of the <HI>Loire</HI> in <HI>Brittany.</HI></P>
