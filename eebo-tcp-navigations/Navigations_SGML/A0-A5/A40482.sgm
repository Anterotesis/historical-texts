<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS Earl of <HI>VVe&s;tmorland,</HI> Baron <HI>le De&s;pen&s;er</HI> and <HI>Burgher&s;h.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is the fate of Honour and Me|rit, my Lord, to be lyableto a|bundance of trouble&s;ome Appli|cations; among which, I am apt to think, a Dedication &s;ometime to be none of the lea&s;t; e&s;pecially when the Author comes with his imaginary Pa|rallels between the Patron and the Work, and by a far-fetch'd Relation, would plead a nece&s;&s;ity for his Pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P>There is no danger, my Lord, of my taking that Method, the Mean|ne&s;s of the Work, and the Merit of
<PB REF="3">
the Per&s;on I Addre&s;s it to, will not permit me to think of any &s;uch Pro|portion. And I am &s;en&s;ible that if that was always &s;trictly to be ob&s;er|ved, Men would be at a lo&s;s to find out an Offering worthy &s;uch a Geni|us, as doth vi&s;ibly appear, even in this your Tender Age; and which (if it plea&s;es the Almighty to continue his Favours to you, and to give you an Addition of Years) will appear with &s;o great a Lu&s;tre, and &s;uch a &s;hining Brightne&s;s, that it will not need to be pointed out, but will com|mand that Commendation from the World, which if I &s;hould give, might probably be thought a Com|plement. For what le&s;s can be expect|ed, my Lord, when all things con|&s;pire to make you truly Great? Your Birth, your Natural Gifts, your Pa|rents and your Predece&s;&s;ors great Ex|amples; &s;o that you need only have an Eye upon Them, and make but a Common Improvement of your good Di&s;po&s;itions, to make you
<PB REF="3">
become, with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, a Pattern of true Greatne&s;s and Virtue to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>If I then pre&s;ume to offer this to your Lord&s;hip, it is not for any Right it can have to your Accep|tance, but becau&s;e I hope it may give you an u&s;eful Entertainment at Vacant Hours. And if, my Lord, it prove any way Acceptable to you, either for the Variety of the Subject, or the Intention of the Dedicator, you will give a &s;ingular In&s;tance of your Generous Conde&s;cention, in taking it as (it is meant) a mark of the &s;incere Re&s;pect wherewith I am,</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>The Author gives an account of his mighty de&s;ire to travel. Of his Country and Profe&s;&s;ion.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>EVer &s;ince I came to years, that I could tell my own inclinations, I found the chiefe&s;t of my de&s;ires was to travel and to &s;ee &s;trange Countries. And whil&s;t, by rea&s;on of my youth, and my more ab&s;olute dependance and &s;ub|jection to my Parents, I could not think of moving in per&s;on; yet, in my thoughts, I was often tran&s;|ported from one Country to another: And by the help of Books, I did in &s;ome mea&s;ure enjoy that &s;atisfaction in imagination which I hoped one day to enjoy in reality; and that too as &s;oon as might be; for the more I read Voyages, Journals,
<PB N="2" REF="10">
and other &s;uch Books, which gave me an account of &s;trange Adventures, places, things, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Men had met with in tho&s;e more di&s;tant parts of the World; the more my de&s;ires encrea&s;ed to &s;ee tho&s;e things, they gave &s;o plea&s;ant a de&s;cription of. Nor did the greate&s;t of dangers, which tho&s;e ac|counts repre&s;ented to me, &s;o much affright me from the like undertakings, as the joyful deliverances out of them, encouraged me to tru&s;t &s;o much the more firmly in Divine Providence. And I propo&s;ed to my &s;elf &s;o much the greater a degree of &s;atisfaction, in as much as I might be induced &s;o much more effe|ctually thereby to admire the great power and wi&s;|dom of God; which, tho' vi&s;ible enough every where, yet are more con&s;picuous in tho&s;e wonder|ful works of Nature, which being le&s;s common and le&s;s familiar to us, are more apt to rai&s;e our admiration and love of him, who is the Creatour of them all.</P>
<P>As &s;oon then as my years and affairs did fairly permit me, I prepared my &s;elf to be gone, and to &s;pend the be&s;t part of my time in Travels.</P>
<P>In order therefore to put my re&s;olution into practi&s;e, I &s;et out from home in the year 1677. on the 28th of <HI>February,</HI> and took my &s;horte&s;t way to <HI>Vienna,</HI> the chief City of the Empire; from whence I went and took a view of mo&s;t part of <HI>Hungary;</HI> after that I went into <HI>Bohemia, Moravia, Sile&s;ia, Saxony,</HI> and other Countries adjacent; thence I went into <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI> where I &s;pent about &s;ix months at <HI>Zurich.</HI></P>
<P>But my earne&s;t de&s;ire to be a travelling &s;omething farther would not permit me to &s;tay, and afford my &s;elf much ea&s;e at any of the&s;e neighbouring Coun|tries; but I went away for <HI>Baden;</HI> taking a Boat that carried me all up the River <HI>Limat,</HI> which is a little River that flows from the <HI>Zurich-Zee,</HI> and pa&s;&s;es thro' the Country of <HI>Zurichgow,</HI> and below
<PB N="3" REF="10">
<HI>Baden</HI> runs into the River <HI>Aar.</HI> Above <HI>Wald&s;hut</HI> I took a Boat on the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which carried me all down that River to <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> whence I went by Land to <HI>Utretcht,</HI> and from thence by Water to <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> where I arrived about <HI>Chri&s;tmas, A. D.</HI> 1679.</P>
<P>The va&s;tne&s;s and beauty of that famous City, and my being a &s;tranger there, made me not a little to &s;tand amazed, and look about me; as well to ad|mire the rarities, that offer'd them&s;elves to my view every where, as to con&s;ider whither I &s;hould go fir&s;t, and where it was mo&s;t likely I &s;hould meet with what I &s;ought after, which was, a fair opportunity of undertaking &s;ome Voyage to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>While I &s;tood in this doubtful manner con&s;idering what I &s;hould do next, a good Woman (in all appea|rance) ob&s;erving me to be a &s;tranger, and full of thoughts, askt me whom I wanted, or whither I would go? I told her that the fir&s;t thing I was to &s;ee after, was a Lodging; for I was but ju&s;t come, and the night was drawing on apace: But withal I told her, what &s;ort of one I wanted, for I had not much money left: Upon which &s;he very compa&s;|&s;ionately told me, I &s;hould be very welcome to her poor Apartment (as &s;he call'd it) if I plea&s;ed. I did not &s;tand long to con&s;ider of the matter, but took hold of the opportunity, and went &s;traightway with her to her hou&s;e: Being come in there, &s;he bid me &s;tay a while till her Husband came home. It was pretty late at night 'ere he came; being abroad at work, a Bricklayer by Trade; when he came, he &s;hewed him&s;elf very courteous; and being all &s;ate down, we fell a talking, and he asking me &s;everal que&s;tions, as it is natural to do to a &s;tranger, and among&s;t others, to what intent I was come thither: I told him the truth of the matter, and the only thing I propo&s;ed to my &s;elf was, to find an occa&s;ion to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and begg'd his a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ad|vice the better to go about my de&s;ign and to com|pa&s;s it.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">
The hone&s;t Man did not &s;eem a little &s;urprized at my de&s;ign, and endeavoured by all means he could to di&s;&s;uade me from it, by &s;etting before me all the dangers I was to run, <HI>viz.</HI> of hard&s;hips, exce&s;&s;es of heat, hunger and thir&s;t, and oftentimes of lo&s;ing life it &s;elf. But the more lively he pre&s;ented all the&s;e and other kind of dangers to me, the more eager it made me to go thro' 'em, and the more it e&s;tabli&s;h|ed me in my re&s;olutions, as if the dangers had been the only charm that drew me. Which my hone&s;t Landlord ob&s;erving, he found it was in vain to at|tempt to turn me from my de&s;ign; and upon that turn'd all his per&s;ua&s;ions into a friendly promi&s;e, that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t me to the utmo&s;t of his power; and he accordingly recommended me to &s;ome of the Chief Men of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and did me very con&s;iderable &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Having in this friendly manner broke the Ice for me, and prepared &s;ome of the Gentlemen to receive my applications, I went chearfully to wait upon them my &s;elf, and told them, that it was my de&s;ire to be employed by tho&s;e honourable Members in any &s;ervice &s;uitable to my profe&s;&s;ion, which was Phy&s;ick. They carefully examined the rea&s;ons that induced me to go the Voyage, and advi&s;ed me to weigh well what I was about, before I fixt my re|&s;olution; that I might not have cau&s;e to repent of my ra&s;hne&s;s when it was too late; and withal they told me that I mu&s;t expect to engage my &s;elf for five years. I told them that I had not wanted lei|&s;ure to con&s;ider of it, and that I was fully &s;atisfied of the reality of my intention, and that there was no danger of my repenting, or of performing with any regret a thing I had re&s;olved upon with &s;o much deliberation. At which they were very well &s;atisfied, yet could they not chu&s;e but wonder to find me, who was but a Youth, &s;o undaunted, notwith&s;tanding the dangers, which they them&s;elves repre&s;ented to me.
<PB N="5" REF="11">
I was then appointed to appear before the Chief Phy&s;icians, and to undergo an examination; which I accordingly did, with twelve more with me, who were, like me, Candidates to &s;erve in &s;everal parts, out of all which there were but &s;ix to be cho&s;en, three being de&s;igned to each Ship, of which there were but two to go this Voyage.</P>
<P>Having been all examined, we retired to the Hall belonging to the Ho&s;pital, where we were order'd to wait for our an&s;wer. The expectation and hope which every one of us were in, of being one of tho&s;e that were cho&s;en; and on the other &s;ide, the fear of ill &s;ucce&s;s, and of di&s;appointment, made us all very unea&s;ie. We were not put out of our &s;u&s;pence that day, but we were bid to come again and make our per&s;onal appearance before the Commi&s;&s;ioners the next day following; which we did, and I was one of them that were cho&s;en, and my Po&s;t was a&s;&s;igned me aboard the Ship called the <HI>(Ternate)</HI> which was the only one that went the Voyage in company with the <HI>Europa.</HI> I was not &s;o very un|ea&s;ie as the re&s;t were during the time of our &s;u&s;|pence, becau&s;e I was prepared again&s;t all di&s;ap|pointments in relation to my particular Profe&s;&s;ion; for I was re&s;olv'd to go upon any account rather than not to go at all; and a Man &s;o re&s;olved may ea&s;ily find admittance into &s;ome Po&s;t or other. And indeed I utterly de&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s as to my being cho&s;en for a Phy&s;ician, being I was &s;o very young, and the number of the Candidates &s;o very great; but beyond all expectation I was one of the &s;ix Per&s;ons that were called in to give in their Names, tho' indeed I was but the la&s;t of them: And being all order'd to &s;tand by the Secretary, we were eve|ry one askt &s;everally the &s;econd time whether we would promi&s;e faithfully to execute our Office, and &s;trictly to ob&s;erve all and every the Articles enjoyn|ed by the Company. There were enter'd with the
<PB N="6" REF="12">
other Phy&s;icians, and my &s;elf a Surgeon for each Ship, and to each of them a Mate, who &s;erves as a Barber. So that we were &s;ix in number, who an|&s;wering all in the affirmative, were &s;worn, and a Declaration was made to us of the &s;everal Offices we were all accepted into, and what Salary each of us was to expect; <HI>viz.</HI> Each Phy&s;ician was to have 42 Gelders <HI>per</HI> month, and his Table, and a Shoar in&s;tead of it 6 Ricksdollers. The Surgeons 28 Gilders, and Diet, and on Shoar 3 Ricksdollers. The Barbers 14 Gilders a month, and their Diet, and on Shoar an allowance proportionable to the others in&s;tead of it. Then we all &s;ub&s;cribed to their Articles, and the Ca&s;h-keeper paid us two months Salary before hand; and three Dutch Skil|lings every day while we &s;tayed on Shoar; which was eighteen days.</P>
<P>After which, a review being fir&s;t made of all the Ships Crew, we were all put on board three long flat Boats (which are for that purpo&s;e, and tho' &s;mall, yet &s;o clo&s;e Deckt, that in a rough Sea they will go quite under the waves and retain no water) they carried us from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to <HI>Texel,</HI> where the two Ships, bound for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> lay. <HI>Texel</HI> is a Sea Port lying on the open Sea, about 16 miles from <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> we had a very fre&s;h gale of Wind (I call it &s;o now, tho' then I reckon'd it a hard Storm) but it was not fair for us; &s;o that we made &s;omething more than four days, before we could reach <HI>Texel:</HI> Whither being come, and ha|ving nothing to do but to Sail, I will in the mean while give my Reader an account of the prepara|tions that tho&s;e Ships generally make for this great Voyage.</P>
<P>Before they go off from <HI>Holland,</HI> they take a ge|neral review of every per&s;on that belongs to the Ship, and each Man hath two months pay advan|ced him: But the full and regular pay begins only
<PB N="7" REF="12">
after they are pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tonnen,</HI> which is a place &s;o called, about a League out at Sea; from that time the full pay is to continue whether the Fleet go forward, or is forced back again by contrary Winds, as they frequently are; and &s;ometimes kept there a great while, in&s;omuch that in the Winter they are laid up for &s;everal weeks, the Water being frozen all about them, &s;o that they cannot &s;tir; and when that happens, they do &s;ometimes di&s;charge their Ships Crew to le&s;&s;en the charges which would otherwi&s;e be very great.</P>
<P>But when the Wind is fair, and the Fleet hath been two or three days under Sail, then there is di&s;tributed to each per&s;on, little and great, 5 Dutch Chee&s;es as a Pre&s;ent from the Company: Then mu&s;t all and every Officer, Soldier and Mariner, make his appearance upon Deck, to be divided in|to their &s;everal Quarters, which are two: The one of them is called the <HI>Prince's Quarter,</HI> the other <HI>Count Maurice's.</HI></P>
<P>Each per&s;on is a&s;&s;igned into one of the&s;e Quar|ters, in which he is always to be found on any oc|ca&s;ion; and there he is to keep the Watch by turns. And that all may know to what part every Man belongs, the names of them all as they are divided is affixed to the Main Ma&s;t, on two di&s;tinct Tables; where al&s;o is &s;et the order and time that every Man is to watch in. The <HI>Prince's Quarter</HI> hath the fir&s;t turn, and is therefore called the fir&s;t Watch. There is a Provo&s;t, who&s;e Office it is to call them toge|ther, and to &s;et the Watch; each Quarter watches four hours, and then is relieved by the other. <HI>Count Maurice's</HI> Quarter hath the &s;econd Watch, and is al&s;o called the <HI>Dog-watch.</HI> There is a Bell in the Ship, by which notice is given them of the time. It is rung at the &s;etting of the Watch, and with a loud voice charge is given by the Provo&s;t to every one to take care not to be drunk upon pain of
<PB N="8" REF="13">
puni&s;hment. There are Hour-gla&s;&s;es put up conve|niently for him that &s;tands Centinel, and the Helms|man to &s;ee; and as &s;oon as the fir&s;t Gla&s;s, which is but of half an hour, is out, they &s;trike one &s;troke on the Bell; when the &s;econd is out, they give two, and &s;o on, adding one for each half hour, un|til the Bell is rung again. Then another Officer comes and calls his Men together out of his Quar|ter, and relea&s;es the other.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e one Man or two always to &s;tand on the Main Top-Ma&s;t head; but the Sol|diers that go to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> are always free from that &s;ervice, tho' in their return from thence Home, that duty lies upon them equally with the Sea-men. Yet (if they can afford it) they may buy it off with a matter of 25 Ricksdollers, tho' the Voyage &s;hould be a year in compleating.</P>
<P>When there are a great many &s;ick in the Ship, then tho&s;e that are in health are again divided, that they may have the duty as equally &s;hared between them as may be: And when a Storm threatens them &s;o as to be forced to hand their Sails, all hands mu&s;t be at work and help; and &s;o likewi&s;e when the Ship is forc'd to clap upon a Wind, &s;o that &s;he mu&s;t tack every two hours.</P>
<P>When any one neglects his turn, or is negligent in his duty, his puni&s;hment is to have a 100 or 200 (or &s;ometimes more) blows on the breech with a Rope's end. Every one that doth not come every morning and night to the Prayers that are con&s;tantly made twice every day, lo&s;eth for that day his portion of Wine and Brandy: There is a P&s;alm al&s;o &s;ung every night, and for that purpo&s;e a P&s;alm book is pre&s;ented by the Company to every per&s;on in the Ship.</P>
<P>Smoaking of Tobacco is &s;trictly forbidden at night below Decks, to prevent any mi&s;chief that might be cau&s;ed by it, the Beds being all &s;tuft with
<PB N="9" REF="13">
very good Cotton; but every where el&s;e it is al|lowed: And there is a great &s;quare Che&s;t with a Pin in the middle, about which there is 10 or 12 fa|thom of Match, where any one may light his Pipe.</P>
<P>At the third Watch it's the bu&s;ine&s;s of one of them to take care to call up the Cook, who, as &s;oon as Prayers are over, goes about the Dinner. Three Meals a day are allowed to all, and imme|diately after Prayers they ring the Bell, then every one comes for his <HI>Quantum</HI> of Brandy, which is about a <HI>quartern</HI> of our mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Saturday</HI> each Man receives five pound of Bi&s;cuit, about a quartern of Oil, and double that quantity of Vinegar, and half a pound of Butter, which a man mu&s;t husband as he thinks be&s;t; it is to &s;erve for the whole week. Three times a week are Fle&s;h-days, <HI>viz. Tue&s;days, Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sun|days,</HI> on which days each Man hath three quarters of a pound of Beef or Pork, but mo&s;t of it is &s;o &s;alt, having lain in the Salt it may be five or &s;ix years, that when it is dre&s;t it hardly weighs half a pound.</P>
<P>As for the Drink: At the &s;etting out the Beer is in common as long as it la&s;ts, which is not very long; when it is out, then every one is reduced to his mea&s;ure of Water, which is about a large quart to a Man, and very well too; but when they come into the <HI>Indies,</HI> if they chance to be commanded away to any other parts, they are often forced to be &s;atisfied with half that quantity, and then you may imagine what a value a Man &s;ets upon his Liquor; and a Man may as well &s;teal all ones mo|ney, as a drop of Water from any one.</P>
<P>There is a very great &s;everity exerci&s;ed over the Malefactors, of which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particularly hereafter. In the mean while to inform the Reader of the general Cu&s;toms, they are as follow.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="14">
If any one wounds another with a Knife, or other Weapon, he is forced to hold up his hand again&s;t the Ma&s;t; and the Barber takes a Knife, and &s;trikes it thro' his hand a little below the fingers; and &s;ometimes as the fault is greater or le&s;s, thro' the middle of his hand, and there he leaves if &s;ticking in the Ma&s;t; &s;o that the Offender mu&s;t pull his hand thro' if he de&s;igns to have it to him&s;elf again. He that &s;trikes an Officer, or Ma&s;ter of the Ship, is without hopes of pardon to be thrown into the Sea fa&s;ten'd by a Rope, with which he is thrown in on one &s;ide of the Ship, and drawn up again on the other, and &s;o three times together he is drawn round the Keel of the Ship, in the doing of which, if they &s;hould chance not to allow Rope enough to let him &s;ink below the Keel, the Malefactor might have his brains knockt out. This Puni&s;hment is call'd <HI>Keel-halen,</HI> which may be call'd in Engli&s;h <HI>Keel-drawing.</HI> But the Provo&s;t hath this Priviledge more than the other, that if any one &s;trikes him on Shoar, he forfeits his hand, if on Board, then he is certainly <HI>Keel-draw'd.</HI> Part of the Provo&s;t's Of|fice is diligently to ob&s;erve the behaviour of the Soldiers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to &s;ee that they be exerci&s;ed eve|ry day by &s;ome di&s;ciplined Soldiers that have been the Voyage already. Puni&s;hment al&s;o is inflicted by his orders on the Soldiers that are catch'd at Cards or Dice, which are &s;trictly forbid; but Tables and Draughts are allowed, yet mu&s;t they not play at them for Money.</P>
<P>All I &s;hall add concerning the manner of going about this Voyage, is by way of directions to tho&s;e who have a mind to undertake it. There are occa|&s;ions enough for any Man among the Dutch, French, Engli&s;h and Portugueze, and every Man mu&s;t take his choice which he will go with, according to the Nation he is of. But for the Dutch (if not for the others too) the be&s;t way is to go to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="14">
whence a Fleet is di&s;patched three times every year, which for management of their affairs at Sea yields to no Sea-men whatever, and therefore is mo&s;t &s;afe and convenient; they go off about <HI>June, September</HI> and <HI>December.</HI> But they will hardly re|ceive any Pa&s;&s;enger, as &s;uch; and therefore for his ad|mittance, he mu&s;t enter into their &s;ervice, into &s;ome Po&s;t convenient for him, at lea&s;t for the Voyage.</P>
<P>Indeed when one comes to Great <HI>Java,</HI> which is by <HI>Batavia,</HI> one may quit their &s;ervice; but the Rules which their Articles bind a Man to ob&s;erve, makes it a freedom not much different from the &s;ervice, by rea&s;on of the great re&s;traint the Company will lay upon a Man. For fir&s;t, He mu&s;t oblige him&s;elf not to &s;tir out of the Country in le&s;s than ten years time: Nor mu&s;t he Traffick in &s;everal goods, as he would de&s;ire; nor with &s;uch Countries as would plea&s;e him be&s;t: For he is only permitted to deal with &s;ome &s;mall part of the Country, at the I&s;lands of <HI>Molucco:</HI> And if a Man tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the&s;e Injun|ctions, he doth not only forfeit all he is worth, but al&s;o his honour and reputation.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that de&s;ign then to give them&s;elves up wholly to the &s;ervice of the Dutch <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany, mu&s;t bind them&s;elves to them for five years, be&s;ides the Voyage forwards and backwards; and take his chance for what part of the Country he is to live in: For it doth not lie in his power to chu&s;e this or that part, as a Man might wi&s;h; &s;ome parts being &s;o much more healthy than others are, and &s;ome much more advantageous than the re&s;t; for that he mu&s;t take his Lot as it falls. It &s;eldom happens too, that any one is removed from the place into which he is ordered at the fir&s;t: but it falls harde&s;t of all upon tho&s;e that are or|der'd to &s;tay all the while at Sea on board; tho' indeed it is more profitable for him.</P>
<P>Any one that goes thither cannot have any pro|&s;pect
<PB N="12" REF="15">
of advancing him&s;elf much, unle&s;s he under|&s;tands Trade very well, and the Dutch Tongue; and hath Friends there, that are able and willing to help him. For when the Company take men into their &s;ervice, they take 3 or 4 times as many Men as they have Employments for, and out of them they employ tho&s;e only that have good recommen|dations. Some men indeed by their Indu&s;try and good Fortune, or rather I &s;hould &s;ay, good Provi|dence, have advanced them&s;elves con&s;iderably from nothing, or very mean beginnings; but there are abundance who want neither parts, nor indu&s;try, who notwith&s;tanding do not move a &s;tep towards Preferment all the while they &s;tay there: Which hath made &s;everal of them to de&s;pair, and betake them&s;elves to very ill cour&s;es. The condition of life wherein a Man meets with lea&s;t di&s;appoint|ments under them, is that of a Soldier; where he hath four Ricksdollers a month and his meat; tho' the latter is very mean and &s;paringly allowed, both in the Ships and in the Garri&s;ons, in&s;omuch that it is a very hard and uncomfortable employ for any one that hath any thing of Education.</P>
<P>The Soldiers receive their Pay as follows; one half of it is paid at two payments in one year; and that not in full, but one part in Cloths, which are reckon'd to him at a &s;ufficient high rate, and the other half is paid him when he is come home again. He receives for his Sub&s;i&s;tence (be&s;ides his pay) 40 pounds of Rice (in&s;tead of Ammunition|bread) <HI>per</HI> month, and &frac34; of a Ricksdoller.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, all the Countries where the Company hath any footing are very unhealthful, except <HI>Cor|mandel, Batavia,</HI> and &s;ome few others, and mo&s;t very ill provided with nece&s;&s;aries, much le&s;s with conveniences, for life.</P>
<P>The Soldiers that remain on Ship-board, are yet wor&s;e u&s;ed than tho&s;e that are at Land, and by rea|&s;on
<PB N="13" REF="15">
of the Foggs they are often in, are more &s;ub|ject to &s;ickne&s;s; and be&s;ides, both there and on Shore, there is more &s;evere Ju&s;tice exerci&s;ed on Offenders than in Europe, and a &s;mall matter brings a Man to open and &s;hameful puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>All this being well con&s;idered, I pre&s;ume no Man can be very fond of going to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> on tho&s;e terms, unle&s;s he is reduc'd to Poverty, or driven to it by &s;ome other nece&s;&s;itous occa&s;ion. But my advice would be to any one that hath a mind to &s;ee the Indies, and to try his Fortune with freedom, to go among the Engli&s;h, who with more honour and genero&s;ity give a Man the liberty to advance him&s;elf, or to pa&s;s his days there as he thinks mo&s;t convenient, and to as much &s;ati&s;|faction as his circum&s;tances will permit him, which are left to a Man to improve as he is be&s;t able, and may then comfortably enjoy the fruits of his Labours and Indu&s;try.</P>

<P>Their &s;etting out on their Voyage out of <HI>Texel.</HI> Come to the Canary I&s;lands. Exce&s;&s;ive Heat there. The way of Burying at Sea. Sharks very dangerous. Many fall &s;ick in their Ship.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>A Review of all our Ships Crew being made, which was three hundred and fifty per&s;ons, on the la&s;t of <HI>May</HI> 1680. We weighed An|chor, and &s;et out with a good Wind, and the other Ship with us. And the next day about Sun-ri&s;ing
<PB REF="16">
we pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Dover</HI> and <HI>Calice,</HI> which are &s;e|ven Leagues di&s;tant from each other. The &s;ame day five Fly-boats from the <HI>Maes</HI> joyned us, they were bound for <HI>Portugal,</HI> by which we were to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The third and fourth day we &s;till had <HI>France</HI> on the left of us, and kept <HI>England</HI> in &s;ight on the right, and &s;ailed &s;ucce&s;sfully, &s;ave that one of the Ma&s;ter's Boys going to ea&s;e Nature at the Ships Stern (whereas the Bowgh is the u&s;ual place) dropt into the Sea; and tho' we hall'd out our long Boat immediately, yet the Ship &s;ailing &s;o very fa&s;t, they could not come at him; &s;o the Boat was hoy&s;ted in again. The Wind continued good for us till we came within &s;ight of the I&s;land <HI>Sal|vagues,</HI> where we lo&s;t our Companion the Ship <HI>Europa,</HI> which had &s;teered another cour&s;e. In the mean time the common Articles which are to be ob&s;erved at Sea, were read; to inform every one of his duty upon all accidents and occa&s;ions; and al&s;o what allowances every Man was to have.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;aid I&s;lands, tho' with a con|trary Wind, which obliged us to tack three or four times a day, till we at la&s;t at three weeks end got in &s;ight of the Canary I&s;lands, and with a &s;ide Wind at N. N. E. &s;ailed thro' between the two I&s;lands. There we &s;aw that va&s;t high Hill call'd <HI>Pico de Canaria,</HI> or the <HI>Peak of Teneriff,</HI> which is of &s;uch an incredible height, that none in the World is to compare to it. 'Tis admirable to &s;ee, how far it &s;tretches it &s;elf above the Clouds. It was at that time &s;o exce&s;&s;ive hot about us in our Ship, that we were forced to have a &s;ail &s;tretched, and that continually kept wetting, to keep us a little cool; and defend us from the Sun's piercing Beams: And yet you might &s;ee through the Clouds, the top of that mountain covered with Snow.</P>
<P>Here our Ma&s;ter died, being upwards of four|&s;core Years of Age, and having made three Voy|ages
<PB N="15" REF="16">
to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies:</HI> Upon which, a Council be|ing called, one <HI>Peter Peters</HI> was cho&s;en in his Place. This old Gentleman was the fir&s;t I &s;aw buried after the Sea-fa&s;hion, which is in this man|ner: They take the dead Body and tye it on a Board, and fa&s;ten two Cannon-Balls to their Feet, and &s;o throw them over-board, ju&s;t as Morning-Pray|ers are over. In this manner they &s;erved the Ma|&s;ter. But my Comrade had not all this pother made about him; for without a Salute or a Cannon-Ball he was barely ty'd to a Board, and thrown over; &s;o that he floated a great while. This Solemnity gave occa&s;ion to a Di&s;pute among &s;ome of our Seamen, concerning the dead Bodies that were thus thrown over-board; &s;ome affirming, That when they were loo&s;e, floating upon the Water, you might turn them how you would, and they would &s;till turn again, with their Face or Head towards the Ea&s;t: Upon which, one of tho&s;e who could not give Credit to that Opinion, went down (the Water being pretty &s;till) and with a Pole turned the Corps about, which immediately turn'd again, by what Cau&s;e I know not, but it convinced him, That the other's A&s;&s;ertion had &s;omewhat of Truth in it.</P>
<P>Such dead Bodies float till &s;ome Shark, or &s;uch like great Fi&s;h, devours them: But I do &s;uppo&s;e they &s;pit out the Plank again. The&s;e <HI>Sharks</HI> we as often call <HI>Men-Eaters</HI> in Dutch, becau&s;e they are very greedy of Mens Fle&s;h. They have a large Mouth, which they open very wide, and Teeth of great length, and exceeding &s;harp, which &s;hut into one another; &s;o that whatever they get be|tween them, they bite clear through. They are about 20 or 24 Foot in length; and they keep about the Ships in hopes of Prey; but are much more frequent in the <HI>Indies,</HI> than in the Way; where they do abundance of Mi&s;chief among the
<PB N="16" REF="17">
Seamen when they go to &s;wim, as we afterwards found, when we came in the Road near <HI>Batavia;</HI> where one &s;wimming at a di&s;tance from the Ship, a Shark came up to him, and drew him under Wa|ter, and we never could hear of him more, or &s;o much as &s;ee any remnant of him; which made all the old Seamen wonder, who &s;aid, They never knew a Shark take any more of a Man, than a Leg, or, it may be, a good Part of the Thigh with it: But for this Man, we did not perceive &s;o much as the Water bloody. Near <HI>Japara</HI> we had a Man, who had lo&s;t a Limb by this means, under our Hands to cure; and he lived &s;even Days after it; but at the end of that time he died, being mightily tortured with a vehement Cramp. Ano|ther time, at the I&s;le of <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> about eight Leagues from <HI>Batavia,</HI> our Ship being layed up to mend &s;omething of the &s;ide of it, the Carpenter going to do &s;omething to it, about a Knee deep under Water, had his Arm and Shoulder &s;nap'd off. I took him and bound him up, but to no purpo&s;e; for in le&s;s than three Hours time, he was dead.</P>
<P>But now to return to my Purpo&s;e; which is, To give you an Account of our Voyage.</P>
<P>We had now been above eight Weeks at Sea, and had had very favourable Winds; in which time mo&s;t of our Provi&s;ions of Brandy, Chee&s;e and To|bacco, being con&s;umed; and the Heat daily in|crea&s;ing; to which we mu&s;t add, That many were not u&s;ed to &s;uch &s;ort of Sea-Diet (and that at la&s;t we could hardly get neither) <HI>viz.</HI> Bacon as &s;alt as Brine, Gray-Pea&s;e half boyl'd, Grout and &s;tinking Water: Our Ship became a meer Ho&s;pital, &s;o many fell &s;ick. The chief Di&s;tempers were, the Drop&s;ie, the Bloody-Flux and Scurvey. Upon this the &s;ick were divided from the re&s;t, and had the Larboard &s;ide allotted them, which is the &s;ide on the left|hand. The Starboard was for the others. Thus we
<PB N="17" REF="17">
continued our Cour&s;e, till we reached the I&s;land call'd, <HI>The I&s;land of St. Paul,</HI> which we left about 30 Miles off on the left-hand, and &s;teered our Cour&s;e for the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>After about &s;even days &s;ail from the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>St. Paul</HI> with very little Wind, the number of our &s;ick increa&s;ed daily, and the di&s;tempers that now reigned mo&s;t, were the Scurvy, and the Small-Pox; which carried off almo&s;t all the olde&s;t of our Men, but the younger &s;ort quickly recover'd. Many were light-headed, and ailed nothing more; which was occa&s;ioned, as I pre&s;ume, only from the exce&s;&s;ive heat we &s;uffer'd, as we pa&s;&s;ed under the Line, and came to the other &s;ide of the Globe. In this di&s;mal condition we went on; our only hope being that we &s;hould not be long ere we &s;hould reach the <HI>Cape Bonne E&s;perance,</HI> or the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
<P>But our hopes were &s;trangely fru&s;trated: for we quite lo&s;t our cour&s;e: For the Snow fell &s;o migh|ty thick (as it is u&s;ual about <HI>Africa)</HI> that our Men could not &s;ee one another the length of the Ship. Then our Ma&s;ter gave Orders that one &s;hould go up the Main Top-Ma&s;t head, and keep &s;trict watch; becau&s;e we were continually in expectation of com|ing to Land. Early the next morning I got me above Deck, and went to take my allowance of Brandy at the u&s;ual place: After which my Com|rade, and I, who had been old acquaintance before we went to Sea, and between whom an inviolable friend&s;hip was contracted, we agreed to go and &s;moak our Pipes, and fell into a chearful confe|rence about our approaching Joy of &s;etting our feet on dry ground.</P>
<P>While we were thus talking, we heard of a &s;ud|den cry of Land, Land, which mightily increa&s;ed our Joy; little knowing after what manner we were drawing nigh to the Shore. But we quickly
<PB N="18" REF="18">
&s;aw our mi&s;take, when the Ma&s;ter upon this out-cry, comes out, and with death in his looks crys our, Oh my poor Ship! we are all undone! At which we &s;tood in amaze, not knowing what to &s;ay, or to take in hand to help our &s;elves.</P>
<P>All this while the Ship was running violently to &s;hore, the Wind being very high, and having no time to hand our Sails, we were forced to cut the Gears, upon which the Wind carried off our Sails over-board, with &s;uch a violent noi&s;e, that one would have thought Heaven and Earth were com|ing together. While we were all running hither and thither, in a mi&s;erable confu&s;ion, the Ship be|gun to crack; which made us all cry out with a loud voice, to Almighty God, to receive our poor Souls. It is ea&s;ie to imagine what a di&s;mal condi|tion we were in, with the noi&s;e the Ship made, and the crying and &s;ighing that &s;o many of us made; for we were &s;till 343 per&s;ons on Board, and the Ship kept &s;till cracking more and more, till at la&s;t the After-part broke, and the Sea beating in violent|ly, &s;unk our Stern in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>None now expected to e&s;cape, and we &s;aw no|thing but death round about us, by rea&s;on of the depth of the Sea on one &s;ide, and on the other the Shore &s;o high, that it was inacce&s;&s;ible. Yet every body was willing to try what they could do; and to prolong their lives as long as they po&s;&s;ibly could. We re&s;olved therefore to leap into the Sea; and, if po&s;&s;ible, to make to Shore, which was near enough to us, if haply we might reach it: But we fore|&s;aw it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to come to it, by rea&s;on of its &s;teepne&s;s, and the violent beating of the Waves.</P>
<P>Thus recommending my &s;elf to Almighty God, and having implored his pardon and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I committed my &s;elf to the Sea, and &s;trove with the utmo&s;t of my power to get to the Rocks. I toucht them twice or thrice, but the Waves carried
<PB N="19" REF="18">
me off again; by this time &s;ome of our Com|pany were got out &s;afe, and they could not help us any otherwi&s;e, than by calling to us, and advi|&s;ing us what was be&s;t to do; which was no &s;mall help to tho&s;e that &s;wom: for the directions they gave from the Shore, was a great guide to tho&s;e poor people who were &s;till in the Sea, and whom fear made &s;o in&s;en&s;ible, and &s;o ha&s;ty, that they could not of them&s;elves think to take the advan|tages they might have done, had they been le&s;s terrified.</P>
<P>After I had been carried off again from the Rock, &s;o far, that I had little or no hopes of ever reco|vering it again, it plea&s;ed God that I was thrown on again, and I luckily &s;truck my hand into a claiy part of it, and thus got &s;afe to &s;hore.</P>
<P>Seven more got out after me, and 35 before, &s;o that 43 of us only e&s;caped; <HI>viz.</HI> the Ma&s;ter, the Steers-man, two Surgeons be&s;ides me, three Car|penters, the Cook's men, the Swabber, the Gunner, 22 Sea-men, and eight Soldiers.</P>
<P>The re&s;t, 300 in number, mi&s;erably lo&s;t their lives.</P>
<P>Here we all fell on our knees, and returned our hearty prai&s;e to the merciful God who had &s;o boun|tifully deliver'd us from &s;o great a danger; after which we went to look a little about us; but none of us knew where we were; which added much to our &s;orrow; be&s;ides that three of our men were al|mo&s;t dead with the cold cau&s;ed by the Sea-water.</P>
<P>The Ship &s;unk down-right, &s;o that we could not &s;ee the lea&s;t part of her, nor had we &s;aved the lea&s;t thing about us. Her Cargo was worth above 328000 <HI>Ricksdollers</HI> in ready Ca&s;h, and many thou&s;and Gil|ders in goods be&s;ides, which were all lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Finding out at la&s;t that it was the fal&s;e <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> we were got upon, and that we were at 40 Miles di&s;tance from the right one, where the Duth Garri&s;on lay; we were forced to go further
<PB N="20" REF="19">
into the Country, which was the more tedious, by rea&s;on of the &s;ick men we had with us. We knew that the Country had good &s;tore of admirable fruits, which we wi&s;hed to come at; and at la&s;t we got &s;ome excellent good Water-Melons, which &s;erved us for Meat and Drink.</P>
<P>In this poor condition we &s;aw &s;ome Hottentots at a di&s;tance, whom we could not come to &s;peak to; for they run away from us. But it was to fetch &s;ome of them that could &s;peak Dutch; and when we had made our ca&s;e known to them, they imme|diately went and acquainted the Governour with it, who &s;treight &s;ent another parcel of the&s;e Hotten|tots (who are the wild Inhabitants of that Country) together with &s;everal Files of Soldiers to fetch us. They took up our &s;ick men, and carried them on their &s;houlders upon Beds made of Reeds; and we were comfortably entertained with good Canary, good Rice, Bisket, and all &s;orts of excellent fruits; all which were extreamly welcome to us.</P>
<P>When we came to the Cape, our Ma&s;ter and the Streers-man went immediately before the Gover|nour, to clear them&s;elves from whatever might be laid to their charge, for the lo&s;s of the Ship, and of &s;o many mens lives; and there alledg'd, that it could not be imputed to their negligence, or want of due care; but that it was the good plea&s;ure of Providence to afflict them in that manner. After which we were all lodged within the Ca&s;tle, and furni&s;h'd with the u&s;ual allowance, and there wait|ed for the <HI>Europa</HI>'s coming; which was no le&s;s than three weeks: So that we gave that over for lo&s;t too, fearing it had undergone like fate with ours. What ob&s;ervations I made in this Country, du|ring that time of our &s;tay, I will now give you an account of.</P>
<P>In the year 1650 a Fort was built by the Dutch in this Cape, and ever &s;ince all the &s;hipping that comes
<PB N="21" REF="19">
thither, whether French, Engli&s;h, or any other Nation, mu&s;t pay Tribute at their fir&s;t Landing. This Land, for its &s;ituation and fruitfulne&s;s, is very commodious for all that go from any part of Europe to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> for refre&s;hing of them&s;elves, and recruiting of Provi&s;ions, and taking in of fre&s;h Water, which comes out of the Rocks and Mountains of the Coun|try. Within the Land, it is richly adorn'd with abundance of Fruit-trees; but near the Shore, there are few, or none, by rea&s;on of the terrible Winds and Hurricanes, that beat upon it in a fearful man|ner, which come generally down from the Moun|tain called by the Dutch <HI>Tafel-bergh:</HI> And by rea|&s;on of the&s;e &s;tormy Winds, this Cape goes frequent|ly with us by the name of the <HI>Storm Cape.</HI></P>
<P>The Dutch, that are there in Garri&s;on, have planted good Orchards and Gardens, which afford all &s;orts of Sallads, Cabages, Turnips, Cowcum|bers, and all &s;orts of Kitchen Herbs: All which are great refre&s;hments to tho&s;e that come from Sea. And likewi&s;e the free Inhabitants, of which there were already &s;ome hundreds when I was there, have Land which produces good Corn, Wheat, and Oats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Vineyards: So that one finds there plenty of good Beer, Wine, excellent Bread, and &s;uch &s;ort of things as well as in Europe.</P>
<P>I dieted at one of the&s;e Free-men's hou&s;es, and I had a very good Dinner of Meat, ro&s;t and boil'd, and Fi&s;h, with excellent Sallad, and Butter, and Chee&s;e, and delicate Beer, all for one <HI>Skelling,</HI> (which is but &s;ix pence Engli&s;h) but Wine I was forced to pay for, after the rate of half a Ricks-doller the quart.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the great &s;tore of Fruits which are com|mon in Europe. There is great plenty of admirable Lemon and Orange Trees, which afford a very beau|tiful pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>The Haven is called <HI>Tafel-Baey,</HI> which is to &s;ay,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
Table-Bay, &s;o called from a va&s;t Mountain ju&s;t by the Shore which is called <HI>Tafel-bergh,</HI> in Engli&s;h <HI>Table-bill,</HI> from its figure, which is &s;eemingly &s;quare and flat at top: It is &s;een a va&s;t way off at Sea; and it lies about five Miles from the utmo&s;t point of the Cape; between which, lieth the Hill <HI>Lewen|bergh,</HI> or <HI>Lion's-bill,</HI> &s;o call'd, by rea&s;on of its re|&s;embling a Lion in &s;hape; the head comes quite up to the Table-hill, and the tail comes down into the Sea.</P>
<P>I had a great de&s;ire to go up to the top of that Hill e're I went from the Cape: So having got &s;ome others who de&s;ired it too, we got leave, and &s;et out the next morning early. It is about a Mile di&s;tance from the Ca&s;tle; we went up it a good pace for a matter of four hours, and yet we were not near to the top: We were pretty well tired, and more afraid of being too long about it, and of being belated; for in the evening it is extraordinary dangerous be|ing there, by rea&s;on of the wild Bea&s;ts that then come abroad; &s;o we e'en re&s;olved to go back again to get in by day-light: For we thought if we had fallen under their clutches, we &s;hould not have been much the better for our experience: And be|&s;ides, a Cloud came over us which wetted us to the Skin, whereupon we returned back &s;treight, and came into the Ca&s;tle about half an hour before night; &s;o that we could not compa&s;s our de&s;ire, nor could ever yet hear of any one that had been up to the top of it.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ion is here &s;o plenty, that the Dutch have it mighty cheap, for a little Copper-wire, for Brace|lets, for Tobacco, and for any &s;uch trifle; &s;o that a large Bea&s;t doth not &s;tand a man in more than a conple of Shillings.</P>
<P>There are a great many Lions and wild Boars. In the Governours Hall are two Lions Skins. The one was of a Lion, that one of the Hottentots &s;hot with his Arrow: The other was kill'd by a Boar. This la&s;t
<PB N="23" REF="20">
Creature, I mean the Boar, hath on its back a &s;harp &s;ort of Prickle; near a &s;pang long, and &s;o hard, that they &s;erve many Trades-men for Bodkins. And the Lion falling furiou&s;ly upon this Boar, the Boar &s;truck him with his prickly Bri&s;tles into the belly, and made him bleed to death, tho' the Boar peri&s;h|ed likewi&s;e in the fight; and they were found dead by one another, and both their Skins were hung up for a <HI>memorandum.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are many Elephants in that Country, and a &s;ort of Bea&s;t they call <HI>Bavians,</HI> the &s;ame we call Baboons; which very much re&s;emble aged Men. Some of our Men had orders once to go into the Wood to cut down part of it. Among&s;t them was one Comical fellow, who had beaten one to death in a quarrel at <HI>Tirol;</HI> and being forc'd to fly, had li&s;ted him&s;elf a Soldier in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and &s;o made his e&s;cape. He &s;taid a little after the re&s;t to ea&s;e Nature; and laid his Satchel down at &s;ome di&s;tance from him; we &s;aw one of tho&s;e Baboons coming towards him, which made us &s;tand &s;till to &s;ee what he would do; and laying hold on his Satchel, away he went with it, and robb'd the fellow of all his provi&s;ion of Bread, and Chee&s;e, and Tobacco; which made very good &s;port for the re&s;t. O&s;tridges are here al&s;o very common; the Eggs whereof are very good to eat. And among many other &s;orts of Birds, which they have, that are uncommon with us, there are a &s;ort called <HI>Sea-Ra|vens;</HI> but of the&s;e there hath been account enough given by &s;everal Writers.</P>
<P>In the Sea, all round this place, one may &s;ee abundance of great Fi&s;h called <HI>North-Capers,</HI> but none of them are catched about the Cape; they have a &s;nout like that of an Hog, thro' which they throw up Water as high as an hou&s;e, and in &s;uch a quan|tity, as to fill almo&s;t a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, and it comes down like a violent &s;hower of Rain: They are al|ways
<PB N="24" REF="21">
to be &s;een about the Cape, but they do no manner of harm.</P>
<P>There is a prodigious quantity of other &s;orts of Fi&s;h, both in the Sea, and in the Rivers too. We went one night with a Net to have &s;ome &s;port, and at two pulls we had &s;o many, we could not carry the tenth part of 'em. The Fi&s;h we caught were made very much like our Carps; and here are al&s;o abun|dance of Tortoi&s;es.</P>
<P>The natural Inhabitants of this place, are called <HI>Hottentots,</HI> meer Heathens; of no extraordinary &s;ize; for the mo&s;t part very lean, and meagre; their Lan|guage very unplea&s;ant, rattling like Turkies when they &s;peak. They go &s;tark naked, only having a Sheeps Skin about them, the Tail whereof comes before their Privities.</P>
<P>When a Ship is new come in, a&s;&s;oon as the Boat lands any of the Men, they get in as it comes back, to beg Bisket of the Sea-men, which they love ex|ceedingly; when they ask for it, they cry <HI>Broqua,</HI> which &s;ignifies Bread.</P>
<P>It is their cu&s;tom to cut out one of their Te&s;ticles when they are young. Their chief Ornaments (if &s;uch may be &s;o called) is on their Legs; they take an Ox, or Sheep's guts, and thru&s;ting out the excrements a little, ju&s;t to let them lye clo&s;e and flat; and while they are moi&s;t, they wrap them about their Legs, and there let them &s;tick. The&s;e very guts is part of their food too; for ju&s;t in this &s;ame pickle, they broil them a little over the fire, and eat them. So that it may properly be &s;aid, that they are meat and cloth to 'em: But to &s;ee them u&s;e-it either way, might very probably give any man be&s;ides them, a vomit. They u&s;e to be&s;mear their body with all manner of dirt and na&s;tine&s;s, which makes them &s;tink wor&s;e than a Goat.</P>
<P>Upon their heads they &s;tick all &s;orts of little Sea-&s;hells, and &s;mall Copper Rings, that come from
<PB N="25" REF="21">
<HI>Neurenbergh,</HI> which the Sea-men bring with them, to give them: And for one of them they will &s;hew you &s;ome of their Tricks; among which one is, to throw a Dart or long Stick, with which they'll hit within the compa&s;s of a farthing a mighty di&s;tance off.</P>
<P>As for their Religion, little can be &s;aid of it, their Language, it not being under&s;tood by any, that ever I heard of. They u&s;e commonly to get together near to the Sea-&s;hore in the morning by Sun-ri&s;ing, and there they get in a Ring, holding each other fa&s;t by their hands, and dance about upon the Sand, looking up towards Heaven, &s;aying &s;omething in their Lan|guage; and then write &s;ome &s;trange unintelligible characters and figures in the Sand, and &s;o depart; all which undoubtedly is intended in honour to &s;ome Deity. I have asked &s;ome of them that could &s;peak a little broken Dutch, what thoughts they had of a God, and whom they believed in; they an&s;wered, that they thought that there was one above, that had made the Hills, and that Sea which we &s;aw, and all that was in them; and that Homage was due to him; but I could not learn any thing further.</P>
<P>They are very good Footmen, and run very &s;wift|ly, which make the Dutch keep always a Troop of Hor&s;e there, to catch them in ca&s;e of any In&s;urre|ction: For they dare not tru&s;t them in the lea&s;t. In mi&s;chief they are cunning enough, tho' wonderfully &s;tupid in any thing el&s;e. If they are not hungry, they'll not work, tho' you would beat them to death; but when their belly incites them to it, they'll work like Hor&s;es. It is not &s;afe to break ones word with them; and if one &s;hould not give them what was promi&s;ed, when their work is done, a man would go in danger of his life.</P>
<P>Their Habitations are mo&s;t on green Meadows, and grounds that bear &s;weet Herbs for Pa&s;ture for their Cattle. Their Hou&s;es are made of Sea-Reeds joyn'd together, and fa&s;tned at top; ju&s;t like our
<PB N="26" REF="22">
Hop-poles, when they are laid up for the Winter; and when their Cattle hath eaten up the Pa&s;ture all about them, then they remove their Hou&s;es, to &s;ome fre&s;h place, and &s;ettle there again for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>As to what belongs to tho&s;e we call Free-men, of which I made &s;ome mention before, they are &s;uch of our Men, as have &s;erved the Company in the &s;tation of a Soldier, or any other way during the &s;pace of ten or twelve years, and then de&s;ired to &s;ettle there, to trade or plant, which they may then do, paying a certain &s;um of Money, and all Impo&s;ts and Cu&s;toms to the Company. The&s;e have dwel|ling-hou&s;es built after a manner like as in <HI>Holland,</HI> but not &s;o high nor &s;o fine.</P>
<P>The chief Commodities which the Company trades in, to quit the Co&s;ts of their Garri&s;on there, is Sea-Dogs, which are catched here in va&s;t quan|tities. They boil the fat out of them, and the Skins are hung up to dry, which they &s;end afterwards to <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>When any Ship comes there, an Order is read to all the People that are on Board, forbidding them all to buy any thing of the Hottentots, except O&s;tridges Eggs, and other like trifles. All Commo|dities of any u&s;e or value, as Rhinoceros Horns, Ele|phants Teeth, and Sea-Dog Skins, are wholly in|gro&s;&s;ed by the Company.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice here is very &s;evere, in re&s;pect to any of the&s;e Heathens e&s;pecially; one in&s;tance whereof I was an eye-witne&s;s of, while I was there; Three of them having ravi&s;h'd a Chri&s;tian Maid-&s;ervant, were hung up by the heels on a Gibbet, and &s;o ended their lives, after they had hang'd there about thir|teen or fourteen hours.</P>
<P>There are four Sea&s;ons of the year here, tho' in a quite different time from ours: For our Summer is their Winter; and in <HI>September,</HI> which was the time I was there, it was their Spring-&s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="22">
Their Winters are cold, and always foggy and mi&s;ty, but there is never any Fro&s;t or Snow. Thus far will &s;uffice to inform the Reader of the nature and cu&s;toms of the <HI>Cape de Bona Speranza.</HI> I pro|ceed now with the continuation of our Voyage.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter we had &s;pent a pretty while here, and were very well recovered from our late Af|fliction, we prepared our &s;elves to be gone in the <HI>Europa,</HI> which by this time was come, and ready to &s;ail off again for <HI>Batavia;</HI> and with the fir&s;t fair Wind we &s;et Sail, and in the name of God we ran out of <HI>Ta&s;el-Bay,</HI> leaving only one Engli&s;h Fly-Boat behind us at the Cape, which was come thither, &s;ince we.</P>
<P>All that day, and the next, the &s;ame fair Gale continued, which blew us along &s;o briskly, that on the next day we were got out of &s;ight of <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> and came into the Main. We had this brisk and fair Gale for eight days together, which car|ried us merrily along beyond the I&s;land called
<PB N="28" REF="23">
<HI>St. Maurice,</HI> about which place men &s;eldom fail of a Storm and bad Weather; &s;o that it was no &s;mall joy to us, to have &s;o fairly e&s;caped it: But alas! our joy was &s;oon palled; and our &s;ecurity proved very deceitful, while we fooli&s;hly took the mea&s;ures of our &s;afety, more from the Climes and Latitudes we were in, than from <HI>His</HI> Provi|dence, to whom the Winds, and Seas are every where &s;ubject; for when we lea&s;t thought on't, the Sky darkned all of a &s;udden, and &s;uch a Hur|rican ro&s;e upon us, as made us all tremble. No &s;ooner had it given us the fir&s;t to&s;s, but our Ship out-did almo&s;t the noi&s;e of it, with the dreadful cracks it gave, in&s;omuch that we expected nothing but to &s;ink in the in&s;tant. All the while the Clouds grew darker and darker, and the Wind increa&s;ed to that degree, that we could not hear one another &s;peak. The Sea gaped &s;o hideou&s;ly, that it could not be thought we &s;hould ever e&s;cape being &s;wal|lowed up; our Ship &s;ometimes mounted on the top of a Wave, plunged down with &s;uch a terrible force, as it had been down a Precipice, that we expected every moment to be overwhelmed with it. And no &s;ooner had we e&s;caped one Gulph, but we were rai&s;ed up again to fall into another. All this while, what with the Sea da&s;hing in upon us, and what with the great Gaps that were in the Ship, we were &s;o full of Water, that we were all forced to pump like Slaves, for three days toge|ther; all which yet was little enough. I for my part, who little thought to have been in any &s;uch employment, yet was forced to fall to, and &s;tick to it for four hours together, which would have been intolerable to me at any other time: But on &s;uch occa&s;ions a Man doth not much &s;tand up|on Niceties: And I do not remember that I was &s;o much as tired with it, for the hopes we had that God would &s;till ca&s;t an Eye of pity upon us,
<PB N="29" REF="23">
and relieve us out of our mi&s;ery, was now all the comfort we had left. But the Weather &s;till conti|nued, or, rather indeed, grew wor&s;e, &s;o that mounting our Ship up an end, one of our Carpen|ters was to&s;s'd out of his Cabin, and had tumbled directly into the Sea, had not one of the Sea-men luckily caught hold of him. I tryed &s;everal places to get a little re&s;t in, and, among&s;t others, I got in by &s;ome Sheep that we had brought from the Cape with us, which I found almo&s;t dead, never a one of them being able to &s;tand on its Leggs. Not finding my &s;elf &s;afe there, without holding fa&s;t by the Boards, which was very tire&s;ome work, I went to the Gunner's Room, where the Surgeons Che&s;ts always lye, to try to get into a Hammock: But all the Che&s;ts there were turned top&s;ie turvy, and in &s;uch a confu&s;ion, that I could not get to the place I de&s;igned for 'em; &s;o I &s;ate me down: But I had not been there three minutes, but I heard a low broken voice ju&s;t breathing out the Name of God; at which, being mightily &s;urpri&s;ed, I looked and found our Provo&s;t, an old Man, lying under tho&s;e Che&s;ts that were jumbled together, and cru&s;ht to pieces with the va&s;t weight of 'em. I ran up to acquaint our Ma&s;ter, who in the hurry took little notice of it, only order'd &s;ome of the Men to throw him over-board, which was immediately done, without any formalities, or &s;o much as a Plank; for we had no time to tye him to one, as it is u&s;ual; but over they threw him, cloaths and all on.</P>
<P>It was now the fourth night that we had been in this condition; and that we gave our &s;elves for gone every moment of that time: So we were all called to Prayers, and every one got out upon Deck with much ado, and held fa&s;t, &s;ome by one thing, &s;ome by another, to hear our Mini&s;ter, who very earne&s;tly &s;ent up mo&s;t devout Prayers to
<PB N="30" REF="24">
Heaven, that God would in his mercy deliver us; or, if it were his good plea&s;ure, to receive our poor Souls unto him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are altogether &s;trangers to the Sea, the Affliction we were in is altogether uncon|ceivable; and for my own part, tho' I have been oftentimes in great dangers by Sea and by Land, and upon many occa&s;ions have, with Courage enough, &s;tood before the Enemy; yet did none of the&s;e dangers ever terrifie me comparably to this, where death doth not only &s;eem &s;ure and inevitable, but comes attended with all the Hor|rour imaginable, and dre&s;t in its mo&s;t hideous and terrifying &s;hapes.</P>
<P>But by how much the greater our danger was, &s;o much the more admirable was the power and goodne&s;s of God towards us: For on the fourth day in the morning the Winds fell, the Air be|came &s;erene, and the Sea calm, which re&s;tored us all, as it were, to life again. We then, as in du|ty bound, fir&s;t fell to prai&s;ing of God, whence our help came; and with Hymns and P&s;alms to rejoyce in him for his goodne&s;s, and our miracu|lous deliverance.</P>
<P>After which we went to &s;et things to right about us, and to mend our tattered Ships. To this purpo&s;e we put all the heavy Cannon on one &s;ide of the Ship, to rai&s;e up the other, that the Car|penters might get at it to work; which they went about immediately: But the Calm did not la&s;t long enough for them to do half what we wanted. We had a brisk Gale, which was very fair for us, it's true; but having &s;o many Leaks un&s;topt, we were forced to keep our Pumps going continually. This Wind held us &s;ix days, during which we pa&s;|&s;ed the Latitude of <HI>St. Maurice,</HI> and got in &s;ight of <HI>St. Paul de Am&s;terdam;</HI> which we left about &s;ix|teen
<PB N="31" REF="24">
Miles on the right off us, and &s;teer'd right up|on Great <HI>Java,</HI> whereof <HI>Batavia</HI> is the chief Town. In all this time we had a great many of our Men &s;ick, and &s;even of them died, and were ca&s;t over|board.</P>
<P>The Wind being &s;o fair for us, the allowance was large, and there was no &s;tint of any thing al|mo&s;t: Yet we wi&s;h'd heartily to be a&s;hore, and the more, for the &s;ake of our Sick: But we want|ed more than a hundred Miles &s;ail to the place we were to go to. But by God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance we reach'd it, beyond our expectation; for, by Sun-&s;etting, a Sailor cryed out, Land; which cau&s;ed a &s;udden joy among&s;t us all; and the Ma&s;ter &s;traight pre&s;ented him a Ducat, or two Ricksdollers, two Chee&s;es, and a Bottle of Canary, according to cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>Upon this we fell to tricking up our &s;elves, painting our Long-Boat and Shalloop, and making our Ship very fine: We fa&s;tned our Anchors, and made all preparations to go to Shore, which was not now above forty Miles from us. By the next morning we got within two hours &s;ail of it; but we over-&s;hot it by above thirty Miles on the We&s;t|ward of it; &s;o that we were forced to tack about to the Ea&s;t; and after &s;ome days &s;ail we came up to &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands that lye within five Miles of Great <HI>Java;</HI> there we ca&s;t Anchor immediately, hawl'd out our Boat, and went on Shore, to fetch &s;ome Coco's, which we divided among the re&s;t on Ship-board. Three days after this, we came into the Road of <HI>Sunda,</HI> wherein a great many little Ve&s;&s;els came to us (which they call <HI>Prawen,</HI> which &s;ail prodigious &s;wiftly) and brought with them &s;e|veral &s;orts of fruits, as Coco's, Pi&s;ang Figgs, which are a long kind of Figg, Eggs, and &s;uch like. La&s;tly, On the la&s;t day of <HI>November</HI> we arrived &s;afely at <HI>Batavia,</HI> where we ca&s;t Anchor before the Ca&s;tle, having lo&s;t thirteen of our Men, and
<PB N="32" REF="25">
about 20 &s;ick &s;till aboard. Here we return'd God thanks for our &s;afe arrival; embraced each other heartily, and di&s;charged our Cannon very briskly. After which the Ma&s;ter taking &s;ome company along with him, went immediately to Shore, to wait on the General, who was the <HI>Heer John Speelman,</HI> at that time Governour of all the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time the <HI>Fi&s;cal</HI> came to our Ship, to take a view of all the Men, and to demand all their Letters: After which the Men were landed, and the Ship unladen: The &s;ick were put into the Ho&s;pital, and tho&s;e that were in health marched in good order into the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Batavia;</HI> where being drawn up before the Generals Apartment, he came out to them, and kindly bad them welcome; and ordered the Major to divide them among&s;t the Militia; but fir&s;t they had three days free|dom given them to re&s;t and take their ea&s;e: Af|ter which they were obliged to gather together every day without fail on a place appointed for them to exerci&s;e, until they were well vers'd in it, and made thorow-pac'd Soldiers of, and fit to be &s;ent on any Expedition to any part of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>For my part, I went to Shore &s;everal times, and diverted my &s;elf very well, until I received an Order from the Surgeon general to take my Po&s;t in a &s;mall Fort, about a Mile or &s;omewhat le&s;s, from <HI>Batavia;</HI> where I found an En&s;ign, two Serjeants, two Gunners, to eight Pieces of Can|non, and &s;ixty private Soldiers. I was mighty well plea&s;ed with my Station here; the Place be|ing very finely and advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, with the Sea on the one &s;ide, and a very plea&s;ant Ri|ver on the other, which came down from <HI>Batavia,</HI> upon which there were continually a great num|ber of <HI>Prawen</HI> &s;ailing to and fro with Chine&s;es,
<PB N="33" REF="25">
going to a certain place, about half a Mile from thence, where their <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> is, wherein they &s;a|crifice at &s;everal times in the year to their Idol, called by them <HI>Ja&s;gin,</HI> and by the Dutch <HI>Jo&s;ic;</HI> and there they perform all their Religious Cere|monies, which are very diverting to a &s;tranger to &s;ee.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Batavia,</HI> the City and Ca&s;tle are as well worth a de&s;cription, as they are a Man's &s;ight: And truly mine was ravi&s;ht with it; for I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I think them yet finer even than <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> it &s;elf. It is five or &s;ix Miles in compa&s;s. The River <HI>Jacatra</HI> runs thro' mo&s;t Streets of the Town, and almo&s;t encompa&s;&s;es it. Upon the&s;e Canals the Inhabitants have the con|veniency of going in Boats to their Gardens and Plea&s;ure-hou&s;es: The &s;ides of them is wall'd up with good &s;quare Stone, and all along each &s;ide of it, there goes a Row or two of fine Cedar, Coco, or Figg trees, where the Free-men u&s;e to walk at night under a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Shade.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle &s;tands toward the Sea. It hath four Ba&s;tions, two of them to the Sea, called the <HI>Ruby</HI> and the <HI>Pearl;</HI> the other two to the City, which go by the name of the <HI>Saphir</HI> and the <HI>Dia|mon.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the whole exact &s;quare, and from top to bottom built up with excellent good &s;quare Stone. On each of the&s;e Ba&s;tions are &s;ixteen half Culverins planted: Be&s;ides this, they are full of fine Trees, &s;uch as Lemons, and Mango's, which makes them look mo&s;t &s;weetly. While I was there, there was a third Gate built to the Ca&s;tle, which before had but two. One of the Gates looks toward the Sea, thro' which the Goods come in from the Ships into the Ware hou&s;es, and it's call'd the Water-Gate. The other goeth
<PB N="34" REF="26">
into the City, which therefore they call the City-Gate.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Ca&s;tle is the Generals Apart|ment, and over again&s;t it are the Hou&s;es of two of the Council-men. The re&s;t, (which are four more) live in the City.</P>
<P>The Government of the <HI>Indies</HI> lies upon the&s;e &s;ix Men. The General's Retinue is not very &s;ump|tuous: He had but twelve Halbardiers, dre&s;t much after the manner of our Yeomen of the Guard, but in Red and Yellow. One of the&s;e is always to &s;tand Centinel an hour before his Chamber. When he rid out, he was attended by a Troop of Cuira&s;&s;iers, and a company of Foot-men, and &s;ix Halbardiers. But all this is nothing to his Re|venue, which exceeds that of &s;everal Princes of Europe.</P>
<P>There are in the Ca&s;tle many other Inhabitants, &s;ome of the chief Merchants; &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and Book-keepers; al&s;o &s;everal Handycrafts men, as Gun-Smiths, Lock-Smiths, Joyners, and &s;uch like, that are to be employed in any Military bu|&s;ine&s;s. The Soldiers have their &s;tandings under the Gates, and on the Ba&s;tions: Sometimes more, &s;ome|times le&s;s, as they have occa&s;ion to &s;end them abroad, or call them home again. Every day about four in the afternoon, they mu&s;t come to the Parade, and pa&s;s by the General's hou&s;e three times; &s;ometimes he comes out, and takes a view of them, to ob&s;erve their carriage, and beha|viour, and to &s;ee whether their Arms are kept in good order.</P>
<P>When any one neglects the Parade, he mu&s;t ex|pect to be &s;everely puni&s;hed; for the Military Di&s;cipline is mo&s;t &s;trictly kept up there. If any one &s;hould chance to &s;leep upon Centry; for the fir&s;t time, his puni&s;hment is to be loaden with
<PB N="35" REF="26">
heavy Arms, for &s;ome days; the &s;econd time he is whipt; and the third time it is death, without re|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle is encompa&s;&s;ed with very wide Grafts or Canals; over one of which there is a fine Stone-Bridge of one and twenty Arches, that goes into a large Field, which is called the <HI>Galg|veld,</HI> that is, the <HI>Gibbet-field;</HI> where Malefactors are executed. There is a Gibbet, a Wheel, and a Whipping-Po&s;t; all which are frequently made u&s;e of. Cro&s;s this Field is another &s;maller Bridge, (where a Centry always &s;tands) which leads to the chief Street of the City, which is called the <HI>Heere-&s;traet.</HI></P>
<P>Within the City are Shops for all kind of Mer|chandize, and very good and rea&s;onable Victual|ling-hou&s;es: The Inhabitants are of all Nations, as Amboine&s;es, Malabarians, Mardigarians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> bur the Chine&s;es, being the chief and greater part, I &s;hall pa&s;s by the others, and give you &s;ome ac|count of them only.</P>
<P>They exceed all the others by far, in cunning and policy; and are very good Mechanicks; and there are of them of all Trades, excepting Clock|work, or Watch-work, and they dive into all man|ner of Commerce whatever.</P>
<P>They wear mo&s;t commonly White or Blew. Their Coats are very large, and the Sleeves &s;o long, and wide, that they fall over their hands. Their Breeches likewi&s;e of the &s;ame colour, are very wide, and come down to their feet. They wear a &s;ort of broad Slippers, like Hungarian Shoes: But they are only made of Pa&s;t-board; &s;o that when they are to go thro' any wet or dirt, they take their Slippers in their hands; then wa&s;h their feet at the next Canal, and wipe 'em; &s;o put their Slippers on again: But in bad Weather, if they are to go thro' a great deal of dht, they wear
<PB N="36" REF="27">
woodden Shoes, &s;uch as the Country People do in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>They are very neat in their Hair, which they have trimm'd and comb'd every week by their Barbers; they do 'em up with a Bodkin, and &s;tick a &s;mall Tortoi&s;e-&s;hell Comb in it behind, and &s;o put a Coif over it, made of Hor&s;e-Hair, like a Net; &s;o that at the fir&s;t, a &s;tranger would take their Men for Women.</P>
<P>Their Hair they value at the hige&s;t rate, &s;ince it is the la&s;t thing they will &s;take at play. They are the greate&s;t Game&s;ters that ever were known; in&s;omuch that they'll play away their Wives and Children, when they have lo&s;t all their Wealth: And when their Hou&s;es and Family are lo&s;t, then goes the very Hair off of their heads: But if one lo&s;es that, he lo&s;es with it all his Credit and Re|putation, and is lookt upon as a Slave, and is forced all his life long to work and &s;ell for other People. Their Beards are very extraordinary, both for their length, and thinne&s;s. I have &s;een them with only five or &s;ix Hairs on their chin, and tho&s;e hang down to their feet.</P>
<P>Their Women are mo&s;t of them Slaves, bought out of the I&s;land <HI>Baly</HI> and <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar;</HI> not very black, but of a deep tawny; &s;hort and very well &s;ett. They may have as many of them as they are able to keep. When a Chine&s;e dies, his Heir &s;ells all his Wives away again; except that one that he loved be&s;t, who is by his Will made free. This makes them Gentlewomen, and their Heirs after them are likewi&s;e ennobled. Such as the&s;e are e&s;teemed as the right Chine&s;es; and they are but rare in the Country; for while I was there, there was not above twenty of them. They have none but Sons, almo&s;t; it is rare to &s;ee a Daughter in a Family. I was very curious to know whence that might proceed: But in vain did I imagine
<PB N="37" REF="27">
many things, to be the natural cau&s;es of it. But being intimate with one of them, the cruel and barbarous method they take was made plain to me, which is, that they de&s;troy their Females; and to this purpo&s;e, as &s;oon as their Big Bellies begin to be perceived, they keep within doors, &s;o that none knows of their being delivered, unle&s;s they bring forth a Male. At the &s;ame time this di&s;covery was made to me, I was entru&s;ted with the life of the di&s;coverer, and therefore I was made to promi&s;e all the &s;ecrecy imaginable. Eve|ry morning their cu&s;tom is, to wa&s;h their Chil|dren in the River.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are kept openly. The Men and Women go in Proce&s;&s;ion, and the Relations among them carry all their Pre&s;ents to the Young Couple, and all their Riches openly before them. Before the doors, where they are to have their Entertainment, is a fine Scaffold made up, where their Mu&s;ick &s;tands, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal In|&s;truments peculair to the Country; as the <HI>Gun|gumma,</HI> which is a kind of Drum, and a &s;ort of Mu&s;ick they make with little Bells, which is agree|able enough. All the way they go, as al&s;o the hou&s;e they are to come into, are &s;trowed with all &s;orts of Greens and Flowers: Or &s;ometimes they go by Water in their <HI>Prawen,</HI> on the Ca|nals that run thro' the City, with their Hair down about their Ears, or hanging down in the Water. When they are come home, the fir&s;t thing they do, is to &s;acrifice to their Idol; which is done after this manner. In a corner of the Room they have an Altar &s;et out with abundance of pretty little Trinkets, upon which is an Image made of Clay, about a &s;pan long. The face of it is very broad, with a large pair of Eyes; it is black, and painted with &s;ome round &s;treeks of Red; a va&s;t large No&s;e, and a long white Beard:
<PB N="38" REF="28">
On the head &s;tand two Horns painted, with all &s;orts of Colours. This Image they call <HI>Jo&s;gin;</HI> to this they bow, and make many &s;alutations; clapping their hands altogether, begging it to keep them from all harms, and to take care that no evil may happen to them.</P>
<P>They own that there is a powerful God, that hath made the Heavens and the Earth: But they &s;ay, that he is of a good nature and di&s;po&s;ition, and that there is no fear of harm from him: But that all their fear is from the Devil, whom they appea&s;e by their Offerings and Prayers under the &s;hape of that Image: Therefore they are very careful to plea&s;e him, and will not &s;ail at night to light Candles made of red or yellow Wax, which they &s;et before it: And there they bring Meat and Drink, and all &s;orts of Fruit, which is all taken away the next day, and then it is eaten by the People of the hou&s;e, and other fre&s;h Meat &s;et in the room of it.</P>
<P>But to return to their Fea&s;ts; the Men and the Women eat always apart. They take up their Meat with an In&s;trument made of two pieces of Wood, which go cro&s;s one another, &s;omething like that which the Gold-beaters u&s;e with us to take up their Leaves of Gold or Silver, which they u&s;e very dextrou&s;ly to take up their Meat with; This &s;erves them in&s;tead of Forks, and they keep them very neat and clean. They &s;it on the ground cro&s;s-legg'd: And if at any time they do &s;it on a Chair or Stool, they &s;till &s;it down with their Leggs cro&s;s-wi&s;e under them, and by that means they have them &s;o pliant, that they can lay them on their Polls, with as great nimblene&s;s and ea&s;e as we can our hands.</P>
<P>But now to make an end of the De&s;cription of the City of <HI>Batavia.</HI> That is likewi&s;e encompa&s;s'd
<PB N="39" REF="28">
with a &s;trong Wall, above forty paces broad, and Earth thrown up again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The Ba&s;tions are like tho&s;e of the <HI>Sluys,</HI> built with large cut Stone, and all &s;quare and well pro|vided with Guard-hou&s;es on all &s;ides of it, where the Soldiers have their Quarters, and none of them dares to be ab&s;ent one night from them, without e&s;pecial leave, and that is but very &s;eldom grant|ed. Be&s;ides this, there are Canals on each &s;ide the Wall all round. The Cannon is always ready to turn, as well upon the City it &s;elf, as upon an Enemy without, in ca&s;e of any In&s;urrection or Di|&s;turbance among&s;t the Inhabitants, which are of all Nations. So that to be the better prepared, if &s;uch a thing &s;hould happen, every Street hath a Ba&s;tion that commands it, from whence they could immediately cut off any Party that &s;hould be made in any part of the Town again&s;t the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The &s;ame care hath been taken, and the like provi&s;ion made in all places in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch, and they are always well provided with Europeans, Chri&s;tians, in the Service of the Company; and there is of cour&s;e a con&s;iderable number of &s;uch as are &s;ettled there, and are married, &s;ome to European, and &s;ome to Indian Women. And of what Nations &s;oever they be, they are permitted to keep the &s;ame Religion, Manners and Cu&s;toms, as they have in their own Country.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trate con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;ons that are in the Service of the Company, and of Burghers, which are Free-men; made &s;uch after they have &s;pent that time in the Company's Service, as was agreed upon betwixt them. The Pre&s;ident is one of the Council, but cannot direct in any thing of moment without the con&s;ent of the General.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="29">
Each of the other Nations have al&s;o a head and chief of their own: But when there is any thing in hand that concerns the Publick; or if they cannot agree among them&s;elves, they are for|ced to appear before the Magi&s;trate of the City, And in all things their Government is very well and prudently e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The four chief Gates of the City are called by the names of the <HI>Utrecht,</HI> the <HI>Delft,</HI> the <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and the <HI>New-Gate,</HI> &s;o called, on the out-&s;ides of which, are the Suburbs, which are large and &s;pacious, and very fine, and inhabited mo&s;t by Chinee&s;es: A va&s;t number of which have been forced by the Wars they had with the Tartars to retire, and &s;eek a Refuge in the <HI>Indies,</HI> over which they have &s;pread them&s;elves: And e&s;pe|cially in all Maritine Towns, where they are fallen into Trades and Commerce with admirable indu|&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Jacatra</HI> is no &s;mall Ornament as well as Advantage to <HI>Batavia;</HI> be&s;ides which, it is beautified with abundance of very fine Orchards, Fruit-gardens, and Plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, which are ve|ry neatly contrived and kept. There is but very little Rice all about it; tho' it is their &s;taff of life. And, as in all the other parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> the only thing that &s;erves in&s;tead of Bread; but yet there is never any want of it, it being always brought in great quantities, and the City &s;uffici|ently furni&s;h'd with it from <HI>Bantam, Japara,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Rivers thereabouts are much pe&s;tered with Crocodiles. While I was there, as we u&s;ed to go a walking in the Evenings, we ob&s;erved one of them for &s;everal nights that u&s;ed to run out of the hedge into the River, as &s;oon as it &s;pied or
<PB N="41" REF="29">
heard us coming towards him: Upon which a de&s;ire took us to try to catch him if we could; which we did in this manner.</P>
<P>We took a long Rope, to which we fa&s;tened a &s;trong double Hook, full of beards: And in&s;tead of arming it with Wires, we did it with Pack|thread; which being loo&s;e about it, gets in be|tween its Teeth, and hinders him from &s;napping the Hook off: This done, we tyed a Dog to this, with the Hook under his belly: And &s;etting him upon a Board, thru&s;t him out into the River, and fa&s;ten'd the Cord to a Tree: Quickly after, the Dog fell a barking and howling, and the Croco|dil did not fail to come to him; and very gree|dily &s;wallowed him in: Upon which the Hook &s;truck into his Throat, and had him fa&s;t. We had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s with this, that we afterwards caught a great many of them. The bigge&s;t we caught was twenty &s;even foot long; and when we opened it, we found two <HI>Steen-Bockiens,</HI> and the head of a black Boy in his belly. We were forced to knock him on the head with great Iron Bars, after we had fired &s;everal Muskets upon him to little purpo&s;e. When the Soldiers kill one of the&s;e Creatures, they get &s;ome Blacks to carry it for 'em to the General; who immediately gives them &s;ix Ducatoons, for their pains. The only advantage I &s;ought for, was to have &s;ome of their Fat, it being very good for &s;everal operations in Phy&s;ick and Surgery.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants u&s;e to catch them with Nets; which is very dangerous, as I my &s;elf have &s;een; at <HI>Bantam,</HI> on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, a Crocodil bit off both the Leggs of a Javan; yet do they con|tinue that way &s;till, and go often to catch them in that manner.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="30">
Be&s;ides the&s;e Crocodils, there are abundance of other &s;orts of Wild Bea&s;ts in the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Japatra.</HI></P>
<P>The Fort where I was order'd to be at my fir&s;t coming, was very near to the Fore&s;t, and ju&s;t in the way to it, from <HI>Batavia;</HI> &s;o that the Hunts|men coming by us, I often went out with them, and &s;aw them catch mo&s;t &s;orts of tho&s;e Wild Creatures that the Country affords, It will not be ami&s;s to give the Reader an account of &s;ome of 'em; and fir&s;t of a &s;ad accident that befell the Hunts-men one day.</P>
<P>We had two Hunts-men that were made free by the General, and had the liberty to go abroad for that purpo&s;e, to catch what they could. The&s;e being gone one day to get &s;ome game for the Ge|neral; which was commonly Wild Pigeons, and other &s;orts of Wild Fowl, and Wild Boars, and a &s;ort of Creature they call <HI>Steen-Bockiens,</HI> which is made much like a Hare, and differs only in that it hath &s;mall Horns, and the Meat of 'em is far more delicate; while they were only prepared for the pur&s;uit of things of this kind, and &s;at down to re&s;t under a Tree, a Tyger fell in a mo&s;t furious manner upon them. They were pretty much u&s;ed to be followed by them; but they u&s;ed to be in &s;uch readine&s;s to receive them, that they were the death of them whenever they did but offer to come near them.</P>
<P>But being now &s;urpri&s;ed by this more than or|dinary fierce Creature, coming of a &s;udden upon them: It was as much as the one could do to lay hold of his Fowling-piece, while the other had nothing to defend him&s;elf with, but his lighted Match in his hand; which he &s;hook about, but to no purpo&s;e: The other had no &s;ooner got his Gun, but in a hurry he fires upon him; but not tak|ing good aim, did not do any execution, but what
<PB N="43" REF="30">
&s;erved to enrage him the more; him the Tyger throws down under him; and &s;eizing the other by the hand, bit off three of his Fingers; notwith|&s;tanding which, he luckily &s;eizing his Gun, fired it, and by good providence laid the Tyger flat on the ground. Upon this he bethought him&s;elf of what he might do for his be&s;t &s;ecurity, for the night coming upon him, the danger increa&s;ed; be|&s;ides that he was now alone, for his Companion was by this time expired, being mi&s;erably torn. He took up the Corps, le&s;t it &s;hould become a prey to the re&s;t of them; and climbing into a Tree, drew him up with him: There he remained in great fear and exce&s;&s;ive pain cau&s;ed by his wound. When he had been there a while, there came a couple of Wild Boars, which he could not &s;ee: But he heard them &s;cratch and tear at the bottom of the Tree, which they did the more furiou&s;ly, be|cau&s;e the blood of his dead Companion was &s;pilt about the place; &s;o he &s;hot upon them at random, and hit one of them, &s;o that he fell dead &s;ome few paces from thence.</P>
<P>The day being come, and the Coa&s;t clear, he gets down, and leaving his dead Companion upon the Tree, the Tyger and the Wild Boar on the ground, comes forthwith to our Fort to me, to have his hand dre&s;t: Which being done, he gave us the account of this Adventure. Our En&s;ign went to acquaint the Major General with it, upon which Orders were given immediately to a Serjeant, to go with &s;ix Soldiers, and &s;ix <HI>Negro</HI> Slaves, with a Bier to the place where this Slaughter was, and the wounded Hunts-man went with 'em, to &s;hew them the place. There they found all according to the Information he had given. The Man was brought to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and decently buried in the <HI>Malai&s;h</HI> Church-Yard; and he that was come off, had for a Reward twelve Gilders given him,
<PB N="44" REF="31">
and a &s;ettled Table for his life, be&s;ides his former Pay, and withal a Corporal's place.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the Fort, is almo&s;t all Woods, which are cut down every other Year by the Soldiers. The&s;e Woods harbour va&s;t numbers of Monkeys, which make there &s;uch a &s;trange noi&s;e, that one would be amazed to hear it. We made it almo&s;t our daily diver&s;ion to go a Hunt|ing after them; and we u&s;ed to catch &s;uch abun|dance of them, that a Man might have one of them for a Pipe of Tobacco. They are a very docile &s;ort of Monkeys, and not in the lea&s;t infe|riour to tho&s;e that are brought out of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>America</HI> for playing of Tricks; but they come but &s;eldom over hither, being very tender, and not able to bear the change of Climates, nor the hard|&s;hip of &s;o long a Voyage: For at my return I took a couple of them with me, but as &s;oon as ever we came on this &s;ide the Tropick, where we begun to feel a change of Air, they were &s;eized with the Bloody-Flux, fell lame, and died.</P>
<P>One way to catch them was, by taking of Coco-Nuts, which are very plentiful there; and making a &s;mall hole in 'em, ju&s;t big enough for 'em to force their Paws into; we hung them up all about the Trees where they came. As &s;oon as they e&s;pyed the hole, they wanting to get at the Kernel, would &s;trive hard but they would get their Paws in: And when they go to take them out again, they have not the &s;en&s;e to &s;queeze their Claws together to &s;lip their Paws out, as they had to get them in: Be&s;ides that, the &s;urprize which the per&s;on cau&s;es, who watches them, makes them le&s;s able to rid them&s;elves of their Manacles; and as they went to run down, they fall with the very weight of the Nut, which is it may be five or &s;ix pound weight. But this way there was no hopes of catching any more than one at
<PB N="45" REF="31">
one time; for when the others &s;ee one of their company thus caught by the Legg, they won't come near the Coco-Nuts all that day.</P>
<P>I went out once for a fancy after them with a Fowling-piece, but I found it impracticable; for after I had &s;pied one of them, and got my Shoes and Stockings off, becau&s;e the place was a kind of a Moori&s;h ground; but he had his Eye upon me too, and led me &s;uch a dance, that I had al|mo&s;t &s;tuck in the Slough, for want of minding my way: And &s;ince that time, I never went after them again; for they are &s;o &s;hy, that it is almo&s;t always labour lo&s;t. And if one doth happen to &s;hoot one of them, if he doth not kill him dead upon the &s;pot, they'll run and &s;top up their wounds with gra&s;s, and &s;o get &s;ar enough from you, tho' they drop in the long run, and go and die in &s;ome hole where you cannot get at 'em.</P>
<P>My chief Recreation was to take a walk to the City, which was a mo&s;t delicious walk indeed, all along &s;haded with fine large Coco-trees. Sometimes I took a Boat, and went to the Fort <HI>Jacatra;</HI> where lay a whole Company of Soldiers, of the number of which our Men was a &s;ort of a Detatchment: It lies about two Miles more to the South, and is the chief Pa&s;s into the whole Country of <HI>Java,</HI> in the direct way to <HI>Japara</HI> and <HI>Kartiri.</HI> Near this Fort flows the famous River <HI>Jacatra</HI> (from which the Fort had its name) which thence running thro' <HI>Batavia,</HI> empties it &s;elf into the Sea about half a Mile below it. There are by the Fort three Powder-Mills upon that River, which I u&s;ed to walk to frequently, being very well worth ones &s;ight for their largene&s;s and ingenious contrivance.</P>
<P>The outward parts of this Country, and that for a con&s;iderable way within too, are very well cultivated, and richly &s;et out with abundance of
<PB N="46" REF="32">
fine noble Gardens, which produce all manner of fruits, for refre&s;hment and for &s;u&s;tenance. There are of all &s;orts of Figg-Trees; &s;ome of which are the mo&s;t delicious fruit that ever was ta&s;ted: So that with its lofty Cedars, which over-top the fruit-bearing Trees, and look &s;o &s;weet and green, and what with their more u&s;eful Coco-Trees, and other fruit-trees, which are always verdant, and afford a cool retreat, and plea&s;ant &s;hade; be&s;ides that their fruits are all of them mo&s;t delicious, I think truly, it may be called an Earthly Paradice, and that no Country in the World can out-do it for gratifying the Eye and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But of all the fruits that the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> pro|duce (now I am about 'em) I think it will not be ami&s;s to give you a de&s;cription of three of the chiefe&s;t of them.</P>
<P>That which de&s;erves the fir&s;t place among&s;t them, is the fruit which they call the <HI>Manges Tanges;</HI> of the bigne&s;s of a common Apple; the &s;hell is of a dark brown colour, in which are con|tained four Kernels, of a fle&s;h colour, &s;ticking to each other, which melt like Butter upon the Tongue, and of &s;o fine and refre&s;hing a ta&s;te, that I never met with any fruit comparable to it, in any other part of the World. It is generally &s;erved up at the greate&s;t Tables, as the mo&s;t de|licious Di&s;h that can be made; dre&s;t with Sugar, Spice and Sack, and put into fine China Di&s;hes. It is al&s;o a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and infallible Remedy again&s;t the Bloody-Flux, when boiled in Water. The Tree that bears this, is about the bigne&s;s of a Mulberry-Tree, and very flow of propagation: For when you have planted it, you mu&s;t never expect to &s;ee it bear; and if it doth chance to bear any fruit within the life of him that planted
<PB N="47" REF="32">
it, it comes to nothing; but withers away: But then there &s;hoots out a little &s;hoot, which you take and plant very carefully, and that becomes your Stock.</P>
<P>The next to this is the Coco-Nut. The Tree is all &s;mooth and even from the bottom to the very top; where the Leaves &s;pread them&s;elves all in a fuff, and the Nutts under them, twenty or thirty on a Tree. The Country people have a pretty Art of Tapping the&s;e Trees, with long <HI>Bamboe</HI> Canes, that will hold two or three quarts, or more, which they very artfully &s;tick into the Tree, and let them fill them&s;elves with the Juice: When they are fill'd, they put it into Ve&s;&s;els to keep, or el&s;e they go away with it to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and &s;ell it fre&s;h there, as it comes from the Tree. This they call <HI>Suri,</HI> which is to be &s;old at the <HI>Suri-hou&s;es,</HI> and is a very pretty refre&s;hing Liquor, and extream plea&s;ant; e&s;pecially when the Wea|ther is very hot. With this Liquor they make the be&s;t Vinegar, and their <HI>Arack</HI> or Brandy, which goes far beyond our be&s;t Rheni&s;h Wine for &s;trength, ta&s;te and colour: And mixing it with Water and Wine, with Sugar and Lemon-Juice, it makes an excellent &s;ort of Limonade, which they call Ma&s;|&s;ack and Burabols, but &s;ufficiently known in Eng|li&s;h by the name of Punch.</P>
<P>The Leaves of this Tree &s;erve the Inhabitants for a common covering for their Hou&s;es, and keep them as dry as our Tiles. The &s;talks of them they bind together, to make Brooms; and they u&s;e hardly any thing el&s;e throughout all <HI>India.</HI> The outward Coat of the Nutt is good to make Match, which burns better than that we u&s;e in Europe&punc; The Sap &s;erves for Oyl to burn. The Kernel be|ing pre&s;t, yields a Milk, of which they make a very pretty kind of Chee&s;es; and it is good for &s;everal other u&s;es, as our Milk is. The Shell is
<PB N="48" REF="33">
good to make Cups, Spoons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It would be too tedious to relate the many u&s;es every part of this Tree is good for: Be&s;ides that, it hath in a great mea&s;ure been done already by other hands.</P>
<P>The third fruit I was to mention, is the Bi&s;&s;ang-Figgs, which is mighty common among&s;t them; and &s;o cheap, that when a Ship comes out of Eu|rope, it is the fir&s;t fruit that is brought to 'em, and you buy it for a trifle; notwith&s;tanding it is ex|cellent; it is in &s;hape pretty much like our Pine-Apples. The Tree is &s;omewhat like our Elder-Tree; and bears all the year in abundance. The Leaves are &s;o large, that one of them will &s;helter a Man from the Sun and Rain, being about two Cubits in length, and one or more in breadth: Which makes &s;ome people apt to believe they were the Leaves which <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> made their Aprons of, after the Fall. They are likewi&s;e made u&s;e of in&s;tead of Paper to pack up goods.</P>
<P>The&s;e I have only taken notice of, as being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable fruits of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and mu&s;t pa&s;s by &s;everal others, which might be worth a de|&s;cription, both for their excellency and variety, that I may not be too tedious.</P>

And in|deed a finer &s;ight of that kind could no where be &s;een; for there were &s;ome thou&s;ands of Eu|ropeans, which were all very lu&s;ty, tall, proper, well-cho&s;en Men; and almo&s;t as many of other different Nations; as <HI>Amboinee&s;es, Malabars, Ma|layers, Mardikers</HI> and <HI>Balingers.</HI> The&s;e were all mixt into &s;everal Companies, which had their own re&s;pective Officers; and after they had all pa&s;s'd Mu&s;ter, they took the Oath of Fidelity in the pre&s;ence of the General, and the Council. Af|ter which the General made a very Eloquent Speech to 'em, in order to encourage them va|liantly to prepare them&s;elves for the Action, which was then in hand; and to make his Speech more truly Rhetorical and per&s;wading, he gave to every Man a month's pay <HI>gratis.</HI> Then one half of the&s;e Men were order'd to march to|ward <HI>Bantam,</HI> and to <HI>Dangerang,</HI> which is a Pa&s;s to it, which they found very well fortified. The other half march'd thro' the Ca&s;tle to the Wa|ter-Gate, whence they were carried off in little Praw's, or &s;mall Boats, on Board the Men of War, that lay in the Road, about half a League from thence, and &s;o they were immediately embarkt. And the Wind blowing then ju&s;t full Ea&s;t, as fair as they could have wi&s;h'd, they &s;traight weighed Anchor, and &s;teered directly to the Royal City of <HI>Bantam.</HI> But</P>
<P>It will be proper to give you &s;ome account of that place, before I go any further, and to ac|quaint you with the cau&s;es and motives of this Undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="34">
Fir&s;t, Then you mu&s;t know, that this large Kingdom of <HI>Bantam,</HI> being in it &s;elf of great &s;trength, hath of late much improved it &s;elf, by the numbers of Foreigners that are come thither from all Nations; and among them con&s;iderable numbers too of Engli&s;h, Danes, Spaniards, Por|tugue&s;es and Dutch, which hath made it a very trouble&s;ome and dangerous Neighbour to the Dutch <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; in&s;omuch that their Ships that came from <HI>Europe,</HI> or any other places thither, did not dare to come by the Road of <HI>Bantam;</HI> but were forced to take a va&s;t com|pa&s;s of three or four hundred Miles; keeping to the Northward.</P>
<P>Moreover, the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> had made &s;eve|ral Attempts upon <HI>Batavia,</HI> both by Sea and Land. Tho' he was always forced to retire with great lo&s;s, and without doing us any great damage. But tho' he could not accompli&s;h his de&s;ire, and the Company could not fear a total overthrow; yet they were &s;till apprehen&s;ive, that he being &s;o much more powerful than they were, would prove very fatal to them in the end, and by little and little bring his de&s;igns to perfe|ction. Thus they were always very unea&s;ie, by rea&s;on of their trouble&s;ome Neighbour: But not finding them&s;elves able to declare open War again&s;t him, they endeavoured to gain him by Pre|&s;ents, and a &s;pecious &s;hew of Friend&s;hip. The&s;e means did not prove altogether un&s;ucce&s;sful, but they were never at good under&s;tanding with each other long together. For the King of <HI>Ban|tam,</HI> be&s;ides that he was very fickle and uncon|&s;tant in his Nature, having &s;o many Foreigners about him, who were no Friends to the Dutch
<PB N="52" REF="35">
Intere&s;t, he was ea&s;ily per&s;waded by them, to break Friend&s;hip with the Dutch upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion. And this the Engli&s;h and Danes were the chief In&s;truments of, who made there a con|&s;iderable Body, were rich, and enioyed great free|dom, and a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Trade; &s;o that they with ea&s;e &s;et the King upon us, in hopes of rooting the Dutch out of their holds.</P>
<P>The Dutch therefore were always forced to be upon their Guard; even while there was the greate&s;t appearance of a &s;ettled Friend&s;hip; for they were &s;ufficiently informed, that he was always contriving how he might at once fall foul on them, and drive them out of <HI>Batavia:</HI> Upon which, they on the other &s;ide, re&s;olved to countermine his de&s;igns, and thought it the be&s;t Expedient to divert him from that Under|taking, by finding him &s;ome Employment with &s;ome other Neighbours; and accordingly made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to create an ill under&s;tanding be|twixt him and the King of <HI>Japara,</HI> hoping that the &s;ilent Fire might in time break out in|to an open Flame. This they effected at length; but it proved little or no advantage to them; for they lay &s;o far a&s;under, that it never came but to a few little Skirmi&s;hes; which did not damage him much, nor profit them: So that they fell very &s;hort of what they had pro|mi&s;ed them&s;elves; for they were fully per&s;wa|ded that the Emperour of <HI>Japara</HI> would have &s;oon been induced to pur&s;ue the King of <HI>Ban|tam,</HI> with the utmo&s;t vigour; e&s;pecially, when there was &s;o great a motive to &s;pur him on, as the rejoyning of that Kingdom to his Empire, from which it had been divided. The I&s;land of Great <HI>Java,</HI> of which I have already made
<PB N="53" REF="35">
mention, did likewi&s;e belong to him once, and altogether made but one Empire, under the Do|minion of the Great <HI>Mataran,</HI> but now it is di|vided into three Kingdoms, to wit, <HI>Japard, Ban|tam</HI> and <HI>Jacatra,</HI> or <HI>Kartiri;</HI> of which <HI>(i. e. Ja|catra)</HI> the pre&s;ent <HI>Batavia</HI> is a part, and did here|tofore belong to the King of <HI>Jacatra;</HI> from whom the <HI>Portugueezes</HI> took it. After that, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> got it from them: And la&s;tly the <HI>Dutch</HI> from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Now the <HI>Dutch,</HI> having all this while made &s;e|veral Attempts upon the King of <HI>Jacatra,</HI> which had proved very advantageous to them; they at length &s;ubdued him: Having fir&s;t made the Em|perour of <HI>Japara</HI> unable to re&s;i&s;t them, or to &s;tand up in the defence of his Neighbour; over whom they carried a total Victory a little before I came to <HI>Batavia.</HI> And having all this while received fre&s;h &s;upplies yearly from <HI>Holland,</HI> which, together with <HI>Germany,</HI> enjoyed a pro|found Peace, and therefore could, and did con|&s;tantly furni&s;h them with large Recruits of choice good Soldiers: The <HI>Duth Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company thought they might be able to cope with <HI>Ban|tam,</HI> and accordingly made preparations again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Now while the&s;e things were in agitation, and they big with the de&s;ign and hopes of infallible &s;ucce&s;s, the faire&s;t opportunity, that could be wi&s;h'd for, offered it &s;elf to them unexpected, and therefore &s;o much the more welcome, which was a &s;udden falling out between the old, and the two young Kings of <HI>Bantam.</HI> The occa&s;ion whereof was this: The old King being weary with the Burden of the Government, and de&s;irous
<PB N="54" REF="36">
to &s;pend his remaining days in ea&s;e and tran|quility, made over his Kingdom to his younger Son; the elde&s;t having dedicated him&s;elf to a &s;piritual life, was a <HI>Bangerang Babay,</HI> &s;omething like an Archbi&s;hop with us; and having thus in|ve&s;ted his younger Son with the Regal Power, he retired to an Old Ca&s;tle called <HI>Dortja&s;&s;e,</HI> the old place of his re&s;idence, about four Miles from <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P>The young King having Reigned &s;ome years, his People began to grow weary of him, &s;pecially the Nobles, the <HI>Bourgerang</HI> and <HI>Kirria;</HI> and they made their Complaints to the old King, that he oppre&s;&s;ed his Subjects; and that he over|burden'd them with his Recreations, and his con|&s;tant Hunting; and by his requiring &s;o much At|tendance and Service to be done him; &s;o that they were no longer able to bear the Yoke. He did not Govern as other Heathen Kings u&s;e for the mo&s;t part to do, but after the Model he had taken from the European Countries; &s;ome of which he had been in, as <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and would have gone to <HI>France, England, Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> if his Law had permitted him; and as far as that had given him leave he had Travelled, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Mu&s;covy, Schiras, I&s;pahan, Japan, Siam;</HI> from which &s;everal places he had taken tho&s;e Methods of Government, which he thought mo&s;t convenient to introduce into his own Dominions. But his Subjects being di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with the&s;e Innovations, con&s;pired at la&s;t together, and Depo&s;ed him; and &s;et his Brother the <HI>Bangarang Babay</HI> in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>Upon this the Old King came with a con&s;i|derable Retinue, and his Main Guard, before the
<PB N="55" REF="36">
Ca&s;tle; which is in the middle of <HI>Bantam.</HI> The young King, having notice of this, commanded the Gates to be &s;hut again&s;t him, and &s;ent to know what he wanted. The old King &s;ent him an An&s;wer, which did not plea&s;e him: Upon which, without more ado, he gives Orders to Fire the Great Guns from the Ca&s;tle upon the City, and particularly, that &s;ome of them &s;hould play upon his Fathers Quarters; again&s;t which &s;ixteen Pieces of Demi-Cannon were planted, which were fired briskly upon him by his po|&s;itive Orders, and &s;ome of them too by his own hand.</P>
<P>Being thus &s;atisfied, that his Fathers Intentions were to Depo&s;e him, he wholly forgot all Du|ty, and &s;ent him word by one of his Concu|bines, that he did not reckon him&s;elf now bound to him in any Bond of Duty; and that he would pay him no other Homage, but Powder and Ball, which he would not &s;pare, for he had enough of it, and that &s;hould be at his &s;er|vice. Be&s;ides the Me&s;&s;age that had made him &s;o de&s;perate, he relied much upon the &s;trength of the Ca&s;tle, which was very well fortified with very good Walls, lined with Earth, like tho&s;e of <HI>Batavia,</HI> and very &s;trong Ba&s;tions upon them, be&s;ides very large Canals round them, with Draw-Bridges. Neither did he want Provi&s;ions or Ammunitions; and the Ba&s;tions were provided with very good heavy Cannon. But the num|ber of his Men was not above three hundred; yet with them he had re&s;olved to &s;tand it out to the la&s;t. So that his Garri&s;on was not &s;o con|&s;iderable as his Court, which, as it chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts of Women, according to the general Cu|&s;tom of Heathen Princes; &s;o he had of them
<PB N="56" REF="37">
no le&s;s than one thou&s;and two hundred that were his Concubines.</P>
<P>With this continual Firing, the City was mi|&s;erably &s;hatter'd, and lookt like a Wilderne&s;s; for every Man had got away that could, and all the Engli&s;h and Danes, together with the Nobi|lity, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Inhabitants, went over to the old King. And having formed a con|&s;iderable Body, they went and be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle; rai&s;ed &s;everal Batteries, and planted their be&s;t Cannon upon them; and then fired briskly in their turn upon the Ca&s;tle. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e preparations, the young King remained undaunt|ed, and only applied him&s;elf to get &s;upplies and &s;upport abroad; and by Advice of two Dutch|men, who were of his Party, and who had for|merly run away from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to &s;helter them|&s;elves from Ju&s;tice, he re&s;olves to &s;end to the Company of <HI>Batavia,</HI> for A&s;&s;i&s;tance. One of the&s;e Dutch-men was appointed for the Negotiation; and immediately was let down from the Wall of the Ca&s;tle; and having pa&s;s'd the Canals in a little Boat, that u&s;ed to lye there, he came to the Enemies Army, thro' which he was unavoidably to pa&s;s; but he being very ready in the <HI>Javan</HI> and <HI>Mallei&s;h</HI> Languages, having been fifteen years in tho&s;e Countries, and having been Circumci&s;ed at his Abjuration of the Chri&s;tian Religion, he ea&s;ily pa&s;s'd thro' all difficulties, and came to the General at <HI>Batavia;</HI> and by word of mouth, without any further Credentials, delivered his Me&s;&s;age to him in the young King's name.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity which the Dutch had long wi&s;h'd for; &s;o that the Me&s;&s;enger needed no great Rhetorick or Art to induce them to take
<PB N="57" REF="37">
it by the forelock. But immediately Orders were di&s;patched; and the Forces had their Ren|dezvous appointed. I my &s;elf had Orders to attend the Major General <HI>St. Martini</HI>'s own per|&s;on; and was in the whole Expedition, &s;o that I may ju&s;tly &s;peak of the matter, and be the more particular in the relation of it.</P>
<P>The Major General above mentioned, com|manded the whole Fleet; and one Captain <HI>Har|zing</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;&s;el</HI> had the whole command of the Land-Forces. Both &s;et out at one time, as I &s;aid before; the one march'd out &s;traight upon <HI>Dangerang.</HI> The Fleet went directly to <HI>Bantam.</HI> Captain <HI>Hartzing</HI> was forced fir&s;t to Attack <HI>Dangerang;</HI> by which means he reckon'd he &s;hould have drawn off the old King and his Army from <HI>Bantam;</HI> but found him&s;elf very much mi&s;|taken: For the place made &s;uch a vigorous Re|&s;i&s;tance, that it appeared they neither wanted ne|ce&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance, nor Courage. We lo&s;t there a great many of our be&s;t Men, in&s;omuch that we found our &s;elves forced to Intrench, left they &s;hould have routed us quite; &s;o we made our Lines of Approach, which we fortified with as good Palli&s;ado's as we could, and &s;o &s;ecured our &s;elves, that the Enemy could not come at us.</P>
<P>In the mean while we continued our Approaches with all the diligence that might be, till we came within Musket-&s;hot of the Fort. There we made u&s;e of a cover'd way, with which we came up clo&s;e to the Enemies works, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure within them: And having fini&s;h|ed our Mines, we &s;et them on fire, with a re&s;o|lution,
<PB N="58" REF="38">
that as &s;oon as they &s;hould blow up to any purpo&s;e, we would a&s;&s;ault them. One of our Mines made a breach that three or four Waggons might &s;tand abrea&s;t in. Upon which it was order'd we &s;hould immediately enter: And &s;o we did, but &s;o with much ado, that we had rea&s;on to fear, we mu&s;t have retired; but after a little re&s;i&s;tance, they &s;eeing us pour in &s;o thick upon them, took their heels, and mo&s;t of them threw down their Arms. All this while we pur|&s;ued them, and made the mo&s;t heavy &s;laughter among&s;t them that ever any Hi&s;tory can &s;hew. For, the Gates of their Ca&s;tle, or rather their Doors being &s;o little, that one could not go un|der them without &s;tooping; they were all forced, almo&s;t, to creep thro' them one by one; and as they were all in a clu&s;ter, and unarm'd, to the number of near five thou&s;and, we fired continually upon them, &s;o that they lay like heaps of Stones one on another, which made the mo&s;t di&s;mal fight in the World: And to prevent the Air being infected with them, we made our Blacks to carry them off, and throw them in the River <HI>Dan|gerang.</HI></P>
<P>Having gotten this Po&s;t, we fortified our &s;elves in the be&s;t manner we could; for we were &s;ure that we &s;hould not enjoy our re&s;t there long; and that we were to be upon our Guard.</P>
<P>In this &s;ix weeks time that we had be&s;ieged this place, we had lo&s;t a great many Men, and a great many were fallen &s;ick by rea&s;on of the bad Water, which had much of the ta&s;t of <HI>Salt-peter</HI> in it; which made Captain <HI>Hartzing</HI> at a &s;tand, whether we &s;hould go on or not. At la&s;t he thought it be&s;t for us to &s;tay there, till we could
<PB N="59" REF="38">
hear of the &s;afe Arrival and Landing of our Fleet before <HI>Bantam,</HI> which we did in a few days after.</P>
<P>Major General <HI>St. Martini</HI> being come before <HI>Bantam</HI> with twenty &s;tout Men of War, each of which carried between four and five hundred Men, be&s;ides a hundred Fire-&s;hips, Tenders, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> gave Orders for their Landing about two a Clock the next Morning: But fir&s;t he took a general Review of the Men, and a Gill of Brandy was given to every one of the Soldiers; and after that &s;ix and thirty of the lu&s;tie&s;t Soldiers were provided with a good quantity of Powder; and &s;ome hundreds of Sea-men were &s;et out with Pole-Axes, or Hatchets, and eight or nine Hand-Granado's to each Man; all which were to Land with the Army.</P>
<P>We lay within Cannot-&s;hot of the Town, and we could both hear, and &s;ee, the old King, who kept continually firing upon the Ca&s;tle; and he had rai&s;ed his Batteries above the tops of the hou&s;es that were in the City, &s;o that the Enemy might &s;ee us with ea&s;e; &s;o they immediately prepared to prevent our Landing, and for that purpo&s;e order'd the Main Body to march to the Sea-&s;hore; and there rai&s;ed Batteries to hinder our coming any nearer. In the mean while it was not a little &s;atisfaction to the young King, to &s;ee our Fleet &s;o near at hand, as well as to hear of our Forces by Land. And be&s;ides, it gave him &s;ome time to take breath, and freed him from the danger he was in continually of a Storm, for the Walls being almo&s;t all down. But now the Enemy could not go on with that De&s;ign, having enough to do to look after us. They took mo&s;t care of a certain place, where they thought we de&s;igned to Land, as indeed we did: But in the night
<PB N="60" REF="39">
time we weighed Anchor, with all the &s;tilne&s;s that might be, and &s;aild on about a League higher; and drawing as near to the Shore as we could po&s;|&s;ibly, we let fall our Anchors again. Our Cannon on Board was all loaden, and all things were or|der'd &s;o, that where-ever we Landed, we might fire them upon the Enemy, and upon the City. The Tenders, and other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els were all Mann'd immediately for Landing; &s;ome with a hundred Men, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s; all which went with all &s;peed to Shore. The Enemy ha|ving notice of this, were ready as &s;oon as we, but had not time to rai&s;e any Batteries there again&s;t us, or to fortifie them&s;elves; for 'ere the day begun to peep, we had got all things ready for our Land|ing.</P>
<P>Major General <HI>St. Martini,</HI> with his Life-guard, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ixty Men, and the Surgeons, came into my <HI>Schappon,</HI> and &s;tood ready to give Order for the Signal, by Drums and Trumpets, for the whole Body of our Army to Land all toge|ther: But the Enemy made a very vigorous Defence; and being advantageou&s;ly Po&s;ted in a Wood that was there, they charged us after &s;o terrible a manner, that what with their Fire, and what with our Great Guns, that played all this while cro&s;s|wi&s;e upon the City, there was need of more than ordinary Courage to &s;tand it out: Be&s;ides that, we all this while being &s;till up to the knees in Water, had a very great di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>In this condition we Charged them for three hours, and could not come to Land all that while; at la&s;t five of our Companies were quite routed, and of the twelve Surgeons that we brought with us, there were but five left; and we that did re|main, were not able to do any great feats, by rea|&s;on that we all this while &s;tood in the Water. When we &s;aw that we could not get any ground,
<PB N="61" REF="39">
we got &s;ome &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, which fetch'd us &s;ome Haubitzes, (which is a kind of Field-Piece to load with &s;mall Shot,) with which we rattled &s;o upon the Javans, that we obliged them to give ground enough for us to get on upon dry Land; and at la&s;t we forced them to quit the Wood, and to to retire to their Brea&s;t-works; &s;o we remained Ma&s;ters of the Field that night: And the next morning at break of day, we marched to Attack them in their Intrenchments.</P>
<P>The Major General, con&s;idering that the Dutch Companies were mightily weakned, commanded Captain <HI>Jochem,</HI> who led the Blacks, to march in the Front; and he &s;ell upon them &s;traightway with admirable Courage and Conduct. The Ma|jor General behaved him&s;elf like a true Soldier, and gave &s;uch tokens of his Invincible Valour, Wi&s;e Conduct, and Indefatigable Diligence, as can|not be well de&s;cribed. And tho' he had the mi&s;-for|tune to have two of his Fingers &s;hot off from his right hand, as he was Riding to and fro to give Orders, he could hardly afford him&s;elf time to have his hand dre&s;t; and I had no &s;ooner done, but he &s;traight mounted again.</P>
<P>The be&s;t of this Engagement was, that mo&s;t of the Enemies Bullets flew over our heads. But I found that they did not all of them take the &s;ame cour&s;e, and was a little &s;urprized, when talking with the Sergeant of our Company, and jeering them for not being good Marks-men, a Bul|let came and laid him dead at my foot.</P>
<P>In the mean while our Men made but little on't: And the Captain was not able to do any thing more, than ju&s;t to keep his ground again&s;t the Enemy. Wherefore the Major General, ha|ving given &s;ome new Orders, and briskly encou|raged the Soldiers, by telling them, that the beat|ing the Enemy out of that place, would be the
<PB N="62" REF="40">
chief part of their work, and the &s;ure fore-runner of a total Victory, promi&s;ing to the three fir&s;t that &s;hould break into the Enemies Camp, an hundred Gilders, two Slaves, and a Pipe of Sack for a Reward; and having by &s;uch like Speeches and Promi&s;es, infu&s;ed, as it were, new Spirits into them, he took upon him the Ma|nagement of the Front him&s;elf, and drawing out Captain <HI>Bleutner</HI> and Captain <HI>Winkler</HI>'s Compa|nies, together with &s;ome others, he led them in Per&s;on; fell upon the Enemy with &s;uch fury, that we &s;oon carried the day; for he had &s;o animated the Soldiers, that every Man was worth two. Our Men being now come too near to u&s;e their Muskets, took their Cutlaces in one hand, and their Hand Granado's in the other; and when the Blacks &s;aw the Dutch drive &s;o hard upon the Enemy, they took &s;uch heart too, that with their Sword and Buckler they poured in upon the Ene|my, and drove all before them: So that the Slaughter we made of the King's Army in this place, was nothing le&s;s than that of <HI>Dangerang.</HI></P>
<P>The Enemy was wholly put to flight, and left mo&s;t of their Arms behind them. And we ha|ving gained that Po&s;t, the Admirable gave Orders that the Ships &s;hould no longer Fire upon the City, le&s;t we our &s;elves might receive &s;ome of their Shot among&s;t us.</P>
<P>All this while we pu&s;h'd on forward to their Palli&s;ado's, and came to the Forr which they called <HI>Speelwick,</HI> where we found a great many of the King's Men; but yet mo&s;t of our Officers found that we &s;hould quickly become Ma&s;ters of it. We &s;ent for &s;ome heavy Cannon from our Ships, and batter'd it down in a very little time. The Sea|men forced open the Gate with Hammers and Axes, and &s;o enter'd, throwing of Granado's: But all the Javaus being fled, we became Ma&s;ters of it, with|out any further oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="40">
This &s;erved our purpo&s;e mighty well, and &s;a|ved us the trouble of any further Entrenchments, except a few Gaps that we made up with Wood, which our Blacks cut down and brought to us.</P>
<P>Here we took a little breath, and re&s;ted that night, and the following day; and a portion of Bi&s;cuit, Sack, and Brandy, was di&s;tributed to each Soldier in the Army. After this fine Refre&s;hment, the Army was put into a new Order, and the Right and Left Wings formed anew, and provided with Field Pieces, loaden with &s;mall Shot. Then we march'd again&s;t the Enemy, who lookt at fir&s;t as if they were able to have eaten us all up for a Break|fa&s;t, they being above thirty thou&s;and of them. But our Officers were not in the lea&s;t di&s;mayed at their numbers, but very couragiou&s;ly Attack'd them on the two &s;ides of 'em; yet taking &s;uch mea|&s;ures, that we could joyn together again at any time. I mu&s;t own, I never expected the Dutch &s;hould have e&s;caped a total overthrow, con&s;idering the va&s;t di&s;proportion of Men; and while I was in this contemplation, on a &s;udden the Javans &s;allied out upon us with &s;uch a terrible and horrid Out|cry, as their Cu&s;tom is, that one would have thought it had been a Hurricane, rather than a Bo|dy of Men: But for all that our Men &s;tood their ground bravely, and gave Fire continually upon them. We had &s;o order'd our Army, that behind each Rank of Mu&s;quetiers we had a Rank of Pikes, le&s;t they &s;hould break in upon us: And all the while we played &s;o thick upon them, with ten or twelve Field-Pieces, that they fell like Bees before us. Our other Wing ob&s;erved the &s;ame Order; and we at la&s;t joyned together again in|to a Body. Having &s;u&s;tained this for near 3hours they &s;ent &s;ome of their <HI>Muck Speelers</HI> among&s;t us, which are a &s;ort of giddy, re&s;olute Fellows, that are ready to be hired upon any kind of
<PB N="64" REF="41">
Exploit, how ra&s;h and mi&s;chievous &s;oever it be; be it to &s;tabb a Man for any private Affront, or any thing el&s;e of that kind: And the more fa|mous Cut-throats they be, the more they value them&s;elves on their Reputation of being &s;uch. Before they go upon any &s;uch &s;ort of undertaking, they eat of a &s;ort of Herb which they call <HI>Avion,</HI> which for a time makes them giddy, and alto|gether un&s;en&s;ible of any danger; &s;o that they are as fool-hardy, as they are dangerous. They rn&s;ht in upon us with an incredible Fury, and be|ing incapable of con&s;ulting their own &s;afety, they came running head-long again&s;t our Men, and &s;pitted them&s;elves upon our Pikes, and de&s;troyed them&s;elves without doing us any hurt. And in a little time after, having killed &s;everal thou&s;ands of the King's Party, we utterly routed them, and made them leave all their Arms behind them. Up|on which we fell from fighting to plundering.</P>
<P>After this, the Major General went, accompa|nied with his Life-guard, and others, to the Ca&s;tle, where the young King was; who imme|diately upon his approach, opened the Gates, came to meet him, and with all the humble acknow|ledgment fell down at his feet, and afterward em|braced him, with all the demon&s;tration of a grate|ful and &s;incere Affection.</P>
<P>Before this, the Admiral had given Orders for the Army to Encamp all round the Ca&s;tle, and the Gunners to be ready in their Po&s;ts with the Artillery, which con&s;i&s;ted of above three hundred Pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>After this the Army having had 3 days re&s;t, and all the refre&s;hment that might be, was order'd to march into the City, and there they had the chief Po&s;ts in their hands, as the <HI>Boom,</HI> the <HI>Speelwick,</HI> and other Ba&s;tions, and the re&s;t were quartered
<PB N="69" REF="41">
in the Engli&s;h, Dani&s;h, and French Quarters. Some were order'd likewi&s;e to keep Garri&s;on in the Ca&s;tle; &s;o that all places of con&s;equence were &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, in order to make the whole our own, when time &s;hould &s;erve a little more commodiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Here I received Orders to repair to the Ho&s;|pital, where I had five Surgeons under me. But there being &s;o many &s;ick and wounded, that we could not well look after them; the be&s;t part of them we &s;ent to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The old King, after this Overthrow, retired with his &s;hatter'd Army, to his 'Fort <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> where having made ready &s;ome hundreds of Prawen, and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, he re&s;olved to be re|venged on us: And having the conveniency of the two Rivers, <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Bantam,</HI> which run from that Fort into the Sea; he Mann'd them in order to go as far as <HI>Batavia,</HI> and to do us &s;ome mi&s;chief, which accordingly he did. For being come into the Road of <HI>Batavia,</HI> they &s;et fire on &s;ome of our Ships; and either kill'd the Men, or took them Pri&s;oners, and went on Shore on the little I&s;land call'd <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> and made &s;ad Havock of the few Inhabitants that were there. To prevent their doing any further mi&s;chief, &s;ome of the large&s;t of our Men of War were &s;traight got ready, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of Prawen, and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els; all which were as well Mann'd as we could wi&s;h: And with the&s;e we went in &s;earch of the Javians. In this Expedition I was made Captain of the Ship call'd the <HI>Europa;</HI> which had eight hundred. Men and three Surgeons; and one Captain <HI>De Ruiter</HI> commanded the whole Fleet. We &s;traight put to Sea, and with our whole Fleet we made directly to <HI>Bantam,</HI> and <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> the two Ri|vers, which I told you, lay &s;o conveniently for
<PB N="66" REF="42">
the Javians to run in and out at; and there we lay, to cut off their Pa&s;s, when-ever they &s;hould attempt to come in there for &s;helter.</P>
<P>Being come there, one half of the Fleet was order'd to &s;tay there, and the other half of which number I was, went in &s;earch of the Enemy. The next morning, as we were come about the I&s;land call'd the <HI>Toppers Hoadie,</HI> we &s;aw them about a League off of us, with more than a hundred Prawen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> crui&s;ing to and fro. Our Admiral <HI>De Ruyter</HI> judged him&s;elf &s;trong enough to En|gage them; &s;o having call'd a Council, it was re&s;olved to fall upon them. Upon this a Gill of Brandy, (the be&s;t thing in the World to in|&s;pire Courage into a Dutch-man) was given to eve|ry one of them: And we were divided into two parts, with In&s;tructions, that upon the Sig|nal given, we &s;hould fall upon them all toge|ther. All that day we lay &s;till; but on the Evening we did &s;o &s;urround our Enemy, that they had no way left them by the next Morn|ing, but to fight their way thro' us, or el&s;e be forced to &s;helter them&s;elves on a little I&s;land call'd <HI>Schlep&s;e;</HI> but that being not above a League in compa&s;s, and be&s;ides, &s;o barren, that it would not afford them any Provi&s;ion or Relief; they were nece&s;&s;itated to Attack us; and indeed they were not long re&s;olving upon it, having four times at lea&s;t the number of Men that we had. They &s;tood to the Windward off us; &s;o that ha|ving that advantage too over us, they came ve|ry briskly upon us with twenty Prawen well Mann'd, and with forty Double Haekken, hoping with them to lay fa&s;t hold of our greate&s;t Ships fir&s;t, and &s;o to board them, and then the &s;maller would ea&s;ily be di&s;patched. The Admiral all this while did not let us fire one Shot, and had
<PB N="67" REF="42">
order'd a kind of Brea&s;t-works to be got ready upon the Deck by the Main Ma&s;t, and under Deck in the Fore-ca&s;tle. Our Prawen and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els kept behind us, ready to fall upon the Ene|my, when-ever he &s;hould Attack us. We had planted &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Haubitzen</HI> I made mention of before, behind tho&s;e Brea&s;t-works, which we had made, which were to pour &s;mall Shot upon them; and there were Men ready be&s;ides the&s;e with their Granado's, Fire-Pikes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to give them a welcome at their entrance. All this while the Javians continually fired upon us, but did little Execution: And being come up clo&s;e to us, they &s;caled us, and in an in&s;tant our large Ships were filled with Javans, who upon their Boarding of us, &s;et up &s;uch a <HI>Huzza,</HI> or rather an Out-cry af|ter their manner, that it made the Air to tremble. But we &s;traightway falling to our works, opened our Brea&s;t-works, and fired our &s;mall Shot upon them, together with our Granado's; &s;o that ne|ver were Men de&s;troyed after that rate. Tho&s;e that were &s;till coming up, and tho&s;e that were in the Prawen, we &s;wept down like a &s;warm of Bees, with our Fire-Pikes, and other Fire-arms, and Hand-Granado's, into the Sea; all that remain|ed begun then to Provide for running off. But out Prawen and light Ve&s;&s;els followed them &s;o clo&s;e, that they killed infinite numbers of them, and took up &s;ome that were fallen into the Sea, and made them Pri&s;oners; who we immediately hang'd up altogether upon the &s;aid I&s;land. The Sea all about us was pure Blood, and we were all in a Cloud of Smoke, tho' we had not fired one Great Gun. There was no le&s;s than two hundred and &s;ixty of the Enemy lay dead Aboard my Ship the <HI>Europa.</HI> The dead and wounded we threw one with another over-board; which cau&s;ed a bitter Out-cry among tho&s;e who were yet &s;en&s;ible,
<PB N="72" REF="43">
or but &s;lightly wounded. After this great Victo|ry our Ships came all together again, and upon a Review, we found our lo&s;s to be two Ma&s;ters of Ships, &s;even Steers-men, eight Officers, and about three hundred and eighty private Soldiers, and &s;e|ven hundred of our Blacks. We lo&s;t two Ships, the <HI>Victor</HI> and the <HI>Ameland,</HI> be&s;ides eighteen Prawen, three Galliots, and &s;even Fire Ships; all which were burnt. But of the Enemies Ships, which were a hundred and twenty in number, there did not one &s;ingle one e&s;cape; their Men were computed to have been 24000.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Fleet comes together again, and falls upon the Javians at Sea. The Author is order'd to <HI>Bantam,</HI> to take care of the wounded, that were &s;ent thither. The Council re&s;olves to pur&s;ue the Javians. Their Malice and inve|terate Hatred again&s;t the Dutch. Several Skirmi&s;hes with them. The Expedition of the Dutch from <HI>Bantam</HI> again&s;t <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> which was the old King's re&s;idence. A Bloody Fight mantain'd by the Dutch again&s;t the Javians, with a great lo&s;s of the former. Some Javian Nobles &s;ent to de&s;ire a Peace, which was re|fu&s;ed. The Garri&s;on of <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e</HI> &s;et fire on <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e</HI> and fly. The Dutch plunder what was left of it. The Author di&s;covers a very con&s;iderable Trea&s;ure buried under ground, but receives little advantage from it. The Admirals Expedition in pur&s;uit of the Ene|my, where he meets with an unlucky accident.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HAving put our &s;elves into a pretty good po&s;ture again, our Men had all the Refre&s;h|ment that could be, with great plenty of Brandy, Sack, Bi&s;cuit, and &s;uch like. The next thing we did, was to di&s;patch a Ship to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to carry the news of our Victory to the General.</P>
<P>After this we went to joyn the re&s;t of our Fleet again. The Javians all this while made &s;e|veral offers to come out of the River <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e:</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="44">
But, our Fleet lying ju&s;t in the mouth of it, they could not attempt it with &s;afety; but were forced to make their way out at &s;ome other &s;mall Rivers; &s;o that &s;ome of them came in &s;ight of us; but we no &s;ooner made towards them, but they retired. Yet were we obliged to keep Crui&s;ing between that place and <HI>Batavia,</HI> to prevent their doing us any mi&s;chief. So that there was continually &s;ome little Skirmi&s;h with them; but never any Engage|ment worth &s;peaking of. In a matter of two months, the greate&s;t part of our Ships, and the be&s;t of our Men, were &s;ent again to <HI>Bantam,</HI> the re&s;t of 'em kept &s;till Crui&s;ing before <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Bantam,</HI> under the Com|mand of Captain <HI>Jochem,</HI> the Men were put on Shore, and Quarter'd among&s;t the others that were in the Fort. It fell to my &s;hare to be of the number too. So I took my Lodging in the <HI>Chinee&s;en Straet,</HI> where I was very commodiou&s;|ly &s;eated for my bu&s;ine&s;s. There were al&s;o two A&s;&s;i&s;tants with me, and three Under-Surgeons, who were Lodged in their &s;everal Quarters, for the better looking after their Patients. Tho&s;e were obliged to come to me ever and anon to give me an account of tho&s;e they had under their hands, and to fetch the Remedies, which were all in my cu&s;tody, and to take my directions. Only tho&s;e other nece&s;&s;aries, as Linnen for Plai&s;ters, Arack, Sack, Salad Oyl, and &s;uch like, were to be fetched from the Steward, who had them in keep|ing; but they were never delivered without I &s;ent an e&s;pecial Order under my hand. The number of our Sick and Wounded was great, and that of the former increa&s;ed, by rea&s;on of the Flux, which was very rief among them: And &s;ome were &s;eized with a Lamene&s;s in all their Limbs; &s;o that we had enough to keep us in employment.</P>
<P>All this while we were making all preparations
<PB N="71" REF="44">
for carrying on the War with utmo&s;t vigour, both by Sea, and Land: But we wanted Men; wherefore we were forced to &s;tay till our Recruits came from <HI>Batavia.</HI> We had an e&s;pecial Eye upon the Royal Fort <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e;</HI> for we &s;aw very well that we laboured in vain, while that &s;tood; and we had rea&s;on to think, that if we did but once ferret them out of their &s;trong hold, we &s;hould not find it difficult to give them a total Overthrow.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that be&s;ides the plea&s;ure I had out of a publick love for my Country, to &s;ee them in a fair way of overcoming their Ene|mies, and enlarging their Territories: I had al&s;o a &s;ecret &s;atisfaction to &s;ee that they were the Ja|vians that were the Object of our Conque&s;ts; they being the mo&s;t faithle&s;s, treacherous and ba&s;e of all the Indians. They are fit for all man|ner of mi&s;chief; but never fit to be employed in any action that's noble or generous. In &s;hort, they are skill'd in nothing, but in cheating, filch|ing, and all manner of knavery. I have often found it to my co&s;t, but that which was mo&s;t notorious, tho' of no great moment, was the trick they put upon me at my fir&s;t coming, which was this. When our Ship was ju&s;t arrived from Eu|rope, &s;ome of the&s;e Javians came to meet us, as it is their u&s;ual manner to come and meet all Ships, that are newly come in, to welcome them, and to &s;ell them fruits, fre&s;h meat, and other refre&s;h|ments. I, who was very much fatigued with my long Voyage, and quite tired with our S<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="2 letters"> Provi&s;ions, was not long a fixing upon &s;ome of their things; and among&s;t others, I was &s;o &s;et upon &s;ome fine fre&s;h Fi&s;h, that they h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">d brought with them, that I was re&s;olved I would have it at any rate.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="45">
Their way is to Truck for &s;ome of our Com|modities; &s;o I agreed to what they ask'd me for the Fi&s;h, which was &s;ome Nails, Thread and Tobacco-Pipes; which I immediately fetch'd for 'em, and gave to the Javian, who was then bu&s;ie about &s;omething that others had bought likewi&s;e. I was &s;o plea&s;ed with the thoughts of the rare Fea&s;t I was to have, and withal in &s;uch ha&s;te to be at it, that I could not &s;tay any longer; but bidding the Fellow leave my Fi&s;h, with any of our Men, I ran down in the mean while into the Cook's Room, to get me &s;ome Water hung on ready, and I think never went &s;o chearfully about any bu&s;ine&s;s in my life. But no &s;ooner had I turned my back, but the Dog pu&s;h'd off his Boat, and went off with my Di&s;h of Fi&s;h, and left me to Dine on my Water; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that from that time I could never have a hearty love for one of the Nation. It was a &s;ort of a &s;ati&s;|faction to me, that in three or four days after we were Landed, I had an opportunity to be revenged on a Javian, which I never let &s;lip, for his &s;ake, when ever it offer'd it &s;elf. They are generally very great lovers of Shooting, tho' they are &s;o &s;tu|pid, as never to under&s;tand it as they &s;hould do: And as I was one day Shooting at a Mark, one of them comes up to me, and wanted mightily to have a Shoot. I told him he &s;hould: So I &s;hot, and loaded again with a double Charge of Powder, and a va&s;t deal of Paper, which I took care to ram down as hard as ever I was able, and then offer'd it him: He very joyfully recei|ved it, and went to fire it: But the Piece recoil|ed &s;o furiou&s;ly, and gave him &s;uch a knock on the &s;houlder, that down fell my Booby, and could hardly &s;tir his Arm for a fortnight, or three weeks after it.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="45">
But to return to our purpo&s;e, all our Affairs were in a very good po&s;ture at <HI>Bantam:</HI> And there was a very good under&s;tanding between the young King, and our Major General <HI>St. Martin.</HI> But the Javans were ever and anon upon us in &s;mall Bodies, and came quite up to our Rampiers: So that we had many Skirmi&s;hes with them; but &s;o incon&s;iderable, that they were not worth the &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>One would admire how quickly our Recruits were made at <HI>Batavia;</HI> for in a few months we had again a con&s;iderable Army on foot, and they had got together Men from all parts of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which were all &s;ent to us with &s;peed. And as &s;oon as they were got together, it was re&s;olved to go directly again&s;t the Royal Fort of <HI>Dor|ja&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Our Major General <HI>St. Martin</HI> left Captain <HI>De Ruyter</HI> to Command <HI>Bantam,</HI> in his ab&s;ence, and him&s;elf went &s;traightway with &s;ome of the be&s;t Ships thither; and in &s;ome days after &s;ent Orders for the re&s;t of the Fleet, and mo&s;t of the Men to follow him, leaving only what was nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Bantam</HI> for the &s;ecurity of the Place, which had little to fear from the Enemy without, and le&s;s to &s;u&s;pect from the young King within, who had but a very incon&s;iderable number of Men of his own with him. So three thou&s;and Men were order'd to be imbark'd and of that Squadron I was, and had that time the Command of the Ship call'd the <HI>Middleburgh.</HI></P>
<P>When we had joyned the Major General, we made together a very fine Fleet; and indeed &s;uch a one, as had never been &s;een before in tho&s;e parts of the World. For we had there fifty two fine large Men of War, be&s;ides &s;ome hundreds of Prawen Fire-Ships, Tenders, &s;mall Boats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Ma|jor General <HI>St. Martin,</HI> &s;oon after the&s;e were
<PB N="74" REF="46">
all come together, went back to <HI>Batavia;</HI> and we continued our way under the Command of the General and Admiral, who&s;e name was <HI>Tack.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we came to ca&s;t Anchor before <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> the Javians got together in prodigious numbers to the Sea Shore, and covered the ground for &s;everal Miles, which was all level from the Sea to the Fort, and all Fields of Rice. Ju&s;t by the Shore were &s;everal Sconces at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other: Some big, &s;ome little, but all va&s;tly &s;trong, being all made with a double Row of Trunks of Coco-Trees, that were &s;et very deep into the ground, and the &s;pace fill'd up with Earth ram'd down ve|ry hard. The &s;pace between each of the&s;e Scon|ces, was all Ditches and Rampiers, with Palli|&s;ado's. The Sconces were &s;o broad, that two or three Waggons might drive abrea&s;t upon them. In the middle of them within, were the dwellings for the Soldiers: Some of them were built up &s;quare, and flat at top; for the Sol|diers to &s;tand there and fight. From all the&s;e places the Javians were continually firing upon us, but to little purpo&s;e, becau&s;e we were far enough out at Sea; yet were we near enough to hear them make many hideous Out-crys, and to &s;ee their Troops hurry from one place to another.</P>
<P>In the mean time we made all ready to Land. Admiral <HI>Tack</HI> going all the while from one Ship to another, to give Orders to the &s;everal Captains. Which done, we went to Prayers, and then the u&s;ual portions of Brandy, Sack, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were di&s;tributed with &s;trict Injunctions to be all ready. Pre&s;ently after they brought us &s;ome <HI>Schappons</HI> or <HI>Pontons,</HI> which is a flat &s;ort
<PB N="75" REF="46">
of Boat like a Hor&s;e-Ferry-Boat, which were fenced with a kind of Brea&s;t-work; and four Pieces for Small Shot to each, and to the&s;e, Gun|ners a &s;ufficient number, with &s;ome Sea-men, with Hand-Granado's. Then went in the Soldiers. After this manner we kept our <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> which was now come, but was none of the merrie&s;t for us. The third day after <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> we unladed &s;even large Ships, and &s;unk them in the place where we had a mind to Land at: And upon them we rai&s;ed Batteries, upon which we planted above forty heavy Pieces of Cannon, to &s;helter us when we Landed, and to annoy the Enemy and their Sconces.</P>
<P>The next day after, about two of the Clock in the Morning, the Signal being given, we all in general left the Ships; upon which I went down into the Boat with the other Surgeons, which were above &s;eventy in number, upon our Ve&s;&s;el, which was attended always by two or three &s;mall Boats, that were ready in ca&s;e of any wounded, that they might carry them off to any place, and upon ever &s;o &s;hallow a Water.</P>
<P>All this while we kept a hideous Shooting with our great Cannon, which was all we fired; under the &s;helter of which we drew all the while &s;till nearer and nearer to Land, from whence the Ene|my kept firing very hotly upon us. When we came to have no more than knee-deep of Water, we got out; and then our Gunners played the more freely from their <HI>Schappons,</HI> upon the Ene|my, and the Sea-men could then make the better u&s;e of their Hand-&s;hells.</P>
<P>In this manner we Charged for above two hours, and lo&s;t a great many of our Men: Their Sconces lying &s;o high, that they had a great command of us; and we on the other &s;ide could hardly reach them. Seeing that we could make but &s;low pro|gre&s;s
<PB N="70" REF="47">
this way, the Council of War met and re|&s;olved to fall upon their Works altogether.</P>
<P>Upon this the Front marched forward directly towards the Enemy, and the Sea-men &s;ucceeded in our place, landing, and taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground, which the Army occupied before. We carried &s;ome of their Forts by Storm in a few hours time, tho' with the lo&s;s of a great many of our Men. As &s;oon as the Javians &s;aw that they had lo&s;t &s;ome of their Holds, they &s;et fire in mo&s;t of the others, and betook them&s;elves to their heels, but did not quite run away from us neither; for they kept moving in the Rice-fields on the &s;ides of us, with a re&s;olution to charge us all in a Body. We had yet a very con&s;iderable Army, tho' nothing in compari&s;on to theirs; but we having by this time got together our Artillery, and planted it very advantagiou&s;ly, we were ready for 'em.</P>
<P>The Admiral gave Orders we &s;hould play upon them with our Artillery, without intermi&s;&s;ion, which we did. The Armies being now come in reach of each other, the <HI>Javians</HI> fell upon us with the greate&s;t fury imaginable; the manner of which I could not &s;ee, being then in the mid&s;t of our Men; but I heard their u&s;ual Out-cry at their fal|ling on.</P>
<P>Our Army opened it &s;elf to the right, and left; and then our Artillery, which was ready for 'em, was all at once di&s;charged upon them, which made a hideous Slaughter among&s;t them. After which our Men clo&s;ed in again, while it was charging again: Our Front moving always with movable Palli&s;ado's before them, which was a very great defence to our Men, and enabled them to keep their Order the better.</P>
<P>All this while, tho' thou&s;ands of their Men dropt, they would not give ground an Inch, nor
<PB N="73" REF="47">
did we. And the day was now &s;o far &s;pent, that we were both forced to give over; yet were we whol|ly &s;et upon pur&s;uing the Stroke, and hoped that the night &s;hould prove rather more commodious and &s;ucce&s;sful, than the day had done. As &s;oon as the night drew on, we begun to play upon them with our Mortars, and &s;ent &s;uch a quantity of Bombs among them, and at the &s;ame time fell on one of their Wings &s;o furiou&s;ly, that we gain'd ground; and pouring our Shot &s;o thick upon them, we put them into &s;uch a con&s;ternation, that they were not able to defend them&s;elves, &s;o that we thought of nothing more, but to prepare to pur&s;ue them; but they did not de&s;ign to put us to that trouble; for we could hear &s;ome of them in the front of their Army cry, <HI>Dida mou boggel ada orang Hollando;</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, I will fight no longer again&s;t the Hollan|ders. This was made known to Admiral <HI>Tack,</HI> and further confirmed by &s;ome of the chief Offi|cers of the Enemies Army, which the Admiral had permitted to come to him, and were &s;ent to parley, and to beg him to grant a Truce, or rather make a Peace. The Admiral dur&s;t not do any thing in this matter of his own accord; but was obliged to &s;end to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> who &s;ent him word again that he &s;hould be &s;ure not to hearken to any Propo&s;als of Peace.</P>
<P>During this Su&s;pen&s;ion of Arms, I conver&s;ed much with tho&s;e Javian Deputies, and I found them very inqui&s;itive, and curious to know what our Army was compo&s;ed of; whether of real Men, or of Devils in humane &s;hapes: We told them, they were only Men, but brave Men, and mo&s;t Germans; and indeed they behaved them&s;elves with &s;uch inexpre&s;&s;ible Bravery, that it might have amazed a polite, and well-di&s;ciplin'd Nation, and much more might it do &s;o, with a Barbarous, and Heatheni&s;h People.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="48">
When the Admiral had received his An&s;wer from the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> he told the De|puties that the Dutch would not hear talk of a Peace, and &s;o &s;ent them away; and bid them tell the old King, that they would now have as little regard for him, as he had formerly &s;hewed for <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which our Artillery was fired again, and we charged them with greater fury than be|fore; &s;o that we put their whole Army to flight, which they took directly towards <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> and there we put them all in confu&s;ion, totally routed them, and made a mo&s;t dreadful Slaughter a|mong&s;t them. We did not pur&s;ue them as we might have done; for we thought be&s;t to keep together, and to continue in our Entrenchments, while we made all the preparations requi&s;ite for a more effectual pur&s;uit of 'em, and in order to Attack the &s;aid Town of <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Here our Men re&s;ted three days, and had all the u&s;ual Refre&s;hments; and in that time our Dead were buried. But in the third night, about twelve of the Clock, we &s;aw the City of <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e</HI> in a blaze, and heard the blowing up of &s;ome of their Building and Fortification, great pieces of which fell into our Camp, which was half a Mile from thence; all which was very agreeable to our Admiral, and to our Army too, becau&s;e it would have co&s;t us a great many brave Men's Lives, if we had been put to fighting for it.</P>
<P>We &s;ent immediately a Party towards the place, to &s;ee what they were doing there, and in what condition they were. But when they came near to the place, the old King withdrew with all &s;peed, and pa&s;&s;ed over the River <HI>Dor|ja&s;&s;e,</HI> with all his remaining Forces; and fled to the Blawe <HI>Peperbergh,</HI> which was about four Leagues from thence; &s;o that our Men found
<PB N="79" REF="48">
<HI>Dorja&s;&s;e</HI> quite empty, and the Coa&s;ts all clear. As &s;oon as the Admiral had Advice of it, he march'd thither with the greate&s;t part of the Army. We found nothing there, but Hou&s;es rui|nated; mo&s;t of them &s;till &s;moaking, and no Inha|bitants, but a va&s;t parcel of Ducks and Hens, fly|ing about the Streets to &s;eek a habitation; which our Soldiers were very glad to &s;ee, and regaled them&s;elves bravely with. I went to take my Rounds in the City, and as I came near to a par|cel of Ducks, I fired among&s;t 'em, and &s;hot a good many of 'em, and the re&s;t ran into a Hou&s;e there hard by: So I followed them with my Fu&s;il in my hand, de&s;igning to knock them down with the Butt end of it; But as &s;oon as I came within the doors, I &s;aw an old Woman &s;itting on a Bed&s;tead with a naked <HI>Kriz</HI> in her hand. But &s;he &s;eeing me come with a Gun in my hand, fell down dead for fear.</P>
<P>Our Men found a great many Javians, that were hid in corners and holes, who could not flee away with the re&s;t, being exceeding old, or otherwi&s;e di&s;abled. Our Soldiers were Quartered upon the Ba&s;tions. The Admiral took his Quarters in the middle of the City, in the Court of the <HI>Old Pa|lace,</HI> which before was the greate&s;t place for Trade.</P>
<P>The chief of my care was, to &s;ee if I could not get &s;ome Plunder, which, while I was looking for, about the <HI>Old Palace,</HI> I di&s;covered a place in a dark Entry, which was not Paved firm, but the Stones only laid loo&s;e; and knowing it to be their cu&s;tom to bury their Trea&s;ures in time of danger, I went to examine the place more narrowly, and made &s;hift to dig down a matter of two foot; but finding nothing but a few <HI>Staefiens</HI> or <HI>Stiftiens,</HI> which were about a quarter of a Yard long, I grew
<PB N="76" REF="49">
weary of my work, not knowing the value of 'em. Tho&s;e I got I gave away to a Free-man, who went privately among the Free-men, and &s;old them for a <HI>Crown.</HI> As &s;oon as ever I knew the worth of 'em, I went in all ha&s;te to the place again, and got a pretty good parcel of them: But as ill luck would have it, 'ere I could carry them off, the Ad|miral, who was come to take a view of the Ru|ines of the Palace, came ju&s;t that way, and find|ing what it was, engro&s;&s;ed it to him&s;elf, and &s;ent for Men immediately to dig there; and there they found as many of them as filled eight Wag|gons, which were &s;old for 700000 Gilders: All which went into the Admiral's Pocket. However he pre&s;ented me with a hundred Gilders for being the di&s;coverer.</P>
<P>In the mean while, others got &s;everal good Booties, as Per&s;ian Quilts, and Per&s;ian &amp; China Silks, with many other rich Furniture and co&s;tly Gar|ments, that were left in the Palace. And I who had found the greate&s;t Booty, came off with the lea&s;t &s;hare.</P>
<P>By what I could &s;ee of the &s;trength of this place, it is certain the Javians wanted nothing but Courage to keep us out; for if that had not been wanting, they might have defied double our num|ber: For tho' the Town was four or five Miles in compa&s;s, yet there was but two Avenues into it, which was hardly wide enough for two Carts to go abrea&s;t, the re&s;t being all Moori&s;h grounds, where Rice grew, but where no Army could have come: And in&s;tead of a Wall, the Town was fenced with a Line of Coco-Trees &s;et clo&s;e to one another, and filled up with Earth; &s;o that our Cannon would never have been able to batter it down, or &s;o much as to make a breach in any part of it. The Buildings within were all built
<PB N="81" REF="49">
with Bamboo-Canes, except the Palace, and the Noble-Mens Hou&s;es, which were of Stone.</P>
<P>Upon the twenty eight Ba&s;tions of this place, we found three hundred and odd large heavy Pie|ces of Cannon, tho' mo&s;t of 'em Iron; but no Pow|der or Bullets; which gave us occa&s;ion to think, that thro' &s;ome carele&s;ne&s;s the Magazine took fire, and &s;o &s;et fire on the whole Town, as indeed we found it true afterwards, by the account which &s;ome of the Inhabitantss gave us.</P>
<P>The Fortification of this place, was &s;o &s;trong, that all the Canonading in the World could ne|ver make a breach in it; for the out&s;ide of it was all of Coco-Trees, &s;et as clo&s;e together as might be, and behind them was all Earth thrown up: And it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Bullet to batter any of tho&s;e Trunks of Coco-Trees, being of &s;o &s;pungy a nature, that a Bullet will &s;tick in them, and go no further.</P>
<P>In this place was a high Hill ca&s;t up by the King's Order, and a few Hutts built at top of it; from whence he u&s;ed to go, and &s;py the Army when it lay before <HI>Bantam,</HI> and take a pro&s;pect of the Fleet, the Country lying all level between tho&s;e two places.</P>
<P>Two Rivers run thro' the Town, the little, and great, <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e;</HI> which unite their Streams a little below the Town, and make up a fine River. It runs thence thro' the plea&s;ant Vales of the <HI>Blawen Peper Bergh</HI> into the Sea, and divides the King|dom of <HI>Bantam,</HI> from that of <HI>Batavia,</HI> or <HI>Jacatra,</HI> all along in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>When we had laid &s;till here &s;ome few days, our Admiral went out with &s;ome Companies to vi&s;it &s;ome of their <HI>Negeryen,</HI> or <HI>Villages.</HI> We plun|der'd all as far as the Plain of <HI>Banta,</HI> which is ju&s;t by the River <HI>Bantam,</HI> and leads towards <HI>Tangbu|rang,</HI> a Province belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Ban|tam.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="50">
Here we &s;aw &s;ome Naekens or &s;mall Boats ly|ing on the other &s;ide of the River; but neither &s;aw or heard any body therebouts. The Admiral had a mighty fancy to go over, and &s;o had &s;ome others of the chief Officers: Wherefore he offer'd &s;ix Rixdollers to any that would venture to &s;wim over and fetch &s;ome of tho&s;e Naekens over. Tho' the River was about a mile wide, yet there were four Seamen that proffered them&s;elves immediately, and &s;everal Blacks, who are generally excellent &s;wimmers; but it was thought &s;ufficient to &s;end the Seamen only, and two of the Blacks, who brought over &s;ix <HI>Naekens;</HI> and having got &s;ome Oars to 'em, they went with them, and fetch'd all the others, which were twenty and odd. When they were all come, the Admiral went into one of 'em, and all the Boats were filled with Men. When we were got over, we found nothing but whole flocks of Hens, and Ducks; &s;o that our Men divided them&s;elves, &s;ome one way, and &s;ome another, to &s;ee if they could find any Body. One of the&s;e Parties met, by misfortune, with a parcel of Amboinee&s;es, who were come out to get &s;ome Coco-nuts; and the&s;e going dre&s;t like Javians, our Men took them for &s;uch, and falling upon them, kill'd &s;ome of 'em, and would certainly have kill'd more, had not another party of ours come in of a &s;udden upon the back of the&s;e poor Amboinee&s;es, who hearing them cry out for quarter, and di&s;co|vering them to be Amboinee&s;es, put a &s;top to the &s;laughter, and prevented further mi&s;chief being done.</P>
<P>We were all well provided with Powder and Ball, and kept on to the end of the Plain; where we found &s;ome little Works, Redoubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but all abandoned. In one of them were four or five pieces of Cannon, which we took, and carried over the River, and from thence drew them to <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="50">
Our Admiral was now thinking to get over the River again, and yet de&s;irous to know what was become of the Enemy; but truly his curio&s;ity co&s;t us very dear; for we had not yet reach'd our Boats, when we perceived a great number of Prawen, full of Javians, making towards us, with &s;uch &s;peed, that we could hardly get our Arms ready. All we could do was to fire upon them, and hinder them from landing ju&s;t in that place. But they pa&s;t by us quickly, and came to another landing-place, that was more convenient. As &s;oon as they had got hold of the Shore, they came upon us in a trice, and &s;o encompa&s;&s;ed us, that we had no way left but to yield, or throw our &s;elves into the River. The fir&s;t of the&s;e could not plea&s;e us, and the latter was almo&s;t as dangerous, for tho&s;e who could not &s;wim very well, &s;o that they who had little or no hopes of &s;wiming over, re&s;olved to &s;tand it out, and to &s;ight to the la&s;t drop of Blood. Our Admiral e&s;caped with five Boats, and &s;ome others followed them as fa&s;t as they could, and &s;wam over after them. I, for my part, finding I could not e&s;cape death, if I &s;taid there, threw away my Arms, and my Surgeons Box, and leapt into the River, tho' with little hopes of getting over; however it gave me a chance for my Life, and it plea&s;ed God to carry me over &s;afe to Shore, where our Men were got, and &s;tood &s;pectators of the dreadful &s;laughter, the Javians were making among the poor Dutchmen, that were left among them on the other &s;ide. There was no le&s;s than two hundred of 'em, who were all cut in pieces, but behaved them&s;elves with an unparallel'd bravery, as Men in &s;uch de&s;perate conditions u&s;e to out-do them&s;elves; and as they held it out a long while, &s;o they &s;old their Lives at the deare&s;t rate that ever men did.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="51">
The Admiral exceedingly concern'd at this &s;ad misfortune, and de&s;irous to revenge the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave Men, took the re&s;t who had made their e&s;capes, and marched with them in all ha&s;te to <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> with a de&s;ign to go over with a Body of Men, and pur&s;ue the Enemy. It was upon con|&s;ideration found impracticable, being we had no way of pa&s;&s;ing the River, for it was very broad every where, and we had not above three or four &s;mall Boats: So that we were forced to quit our de&s;igns; but that we might not go altogether un|revenged, we &s;et fire to all that remained &s;tanding in <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> after we had &s;taid three or four days in it. The main Body of our Army continued along the Sea Coa&s;t, very well entrenched, under the Command of Captain <HI>Harzing;</HI> while the Ad|miral went, with &s;ome &s;mall Ships, and &s;ome Men, down the River <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Bantam</HI> by Sea.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AS &s;oon as we were come upon the Road of <HI>Bantam,</HI> the Young King came to meet our Admiral, and to thank him for his Signal Services; and after &s;ome Complements pa&s;&s;ed between them, they went both of them on Shore in the &s;ame
<PB N="86" REF="52">
Boat; and all the Men got ready, and landed &s;oon after them; and were divided among the re&s;t of the Soldiers that were in the place. I was or|der'd to go to my old Po&s;t in the Ho&s;pital: But another Order came, not long after, to me, to get ready to go to Captain <HI>Ruiter,</HI> to view the Country along the River <HI>Tangburang,</HI> which runs thro' the Province of that Name, and comes by <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P>In our march we &s;aw very plea&s;ant <HI>Negeryen</HI> on both &s;ides the River, tho' all without Inhabitants. But one Night as we were very &s;ilent in our march, we were &s;urprized with a &s;udden alarm, and out|cry in one of the neighbouring Villages. We were not very much corncerned at it, becau&s;e we were 400 of us; however we &s;tood all to our Arms, and moved, according to our Captains Orders, towards the Village, and there we met with 'em upon the march, but it was not intended again&s;t us. Some of our Front only could fire upon them, yet that &s;erved to bring down &s;everal of the Javians; but the Blacks or Amboinee&s;es, of which we had a Company with us, pur&s;ued them &s;o long, that they brought us &s;eventy Heads of 'em, when they came back to us the next Morning; according to the Cu&s;tom of all tho&s;e Nations, whether they fight for us, or again&s;t us; which is always to cut off the Heads of as many of their Enemies, as they kill, and to bring them to their Commanders, as tokens of their Valour.</P>
<P>Having had good &s;ucce&s;s thus far, our Captain was for moving forwards, and pur&s;uing our good Fortune; which we did, till we came to a &s;mall River that runs into <HI>Tangburang:</HI> There we found &s;ome Forts, and &s;ome Negeryen, well provided with Men. We were about going over to them, and we could have done it, the River not being very deep; but our Captain did not think it &s;afe;
<PB N="87" REF="52">
becau&s;e we did not know what Numbers there might be of the Enemy, or whether they might not lie there in ambu&s;cade. He immediately di&s;|patch'd &s;ome of our Men to <HI>Bantam,</HI> to Admiral <HI>Tack</HI> for Recruits; and according to his de&s;ire he had the very next day three Companies of Dutch &s;ent him, and two of Blacks, that were Banda|nee&s;es.</P>
<P>With this Reinforcement we cro&s;&s;ed the River briskly, and marched directly towards their Villa|ges and Forts: But we had not marcht long, be|fore our Front, (which was hardly got in rightorder, after pa&s;&s;ing through the River,) but a parcel of about a hundred and fifty of our Men fell in with a Party of near four hundred of the Enemy; they would at fir&s;t have been glad to have been a little farther off, but there being no retreat, they enga|ged them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they killed above an hundred and &s;eventy of 'em, and wounded &s;e|veral, and made the re&s;t retire to <HI>Tangburang.</HI> As we pur&s;ued them, we took &s;ome of them, who had de&s;erted the others, and hid them&s;elves in the Woods; who all told us, that all the Enemies Force was within three or four miles of us, and more than eight thou&s;and &s;trong. That it was the &s;ame Army which had continually been com|manded by the Old King, and that they lay there in order to hinder our coming over that River.</P>
<P>Upon this information, our Captain &s;ent &s;ome Expre&s;&s;es with all &s;peed to <HI>Bantam,</HI> to give an ac|count of it to the Admiral, who, without delay, &s;ent &s;ome hundreds of Men more, and &s;ome Field-Pieces likewi&s;e. Then were all the Officers com|manded to take e&s;pecial care, that all their Men might be well provided with Powder and Ball. All our Body was divided into five Parties, each con|&s;i&s;ting of four Companies, and all the nece&s;&s;ary Orders were given; then all our Army went
<PB N="88" REF="53">
to Prayers, after which we marched &s;traight upon the Enemy.</P>
<P>A Lieutenant with fifty Men was &s;ent out be|fore, to &s;ec what he could di&s;cover of the Enemy, and &s;o to give us information. We had not moved half an hour, e're we had an account that the Ja|vians were coming to give us battle, and that they were eight thou&s;and &s;trong. All our Parties put together, made but four thou&s;and; yet were we in hopes that we might encompa&s;s them, as indeed we did in a very little while, and made the place &s;o hot for 'em, and &s;owed the ground &s;o thick with their dead Bodies, that they be|took them&s;elves to their Heels, and fled in all ha&s;te to <HI>Anier,</HI> which is a &s;trong and well-for|fied place, about two miles from thence, and is the chief Pa&s;s into the Province of <HI>Tangburang.</HI> Wherefore we provided our &s;elves immediately with Brea&s;t-works, to &s;ecure us &s;elves from the Enemies &s;allies. Every one that work at the ca&s;ting them up, had a Rix Doller as a pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The next day, when we had hardly fini&s;h'd them, the Enemy made a &s;ally upon us, which turned much to our advantage; for being pretty well prepared for 'em, we made &s;hift to cut off &s;even hundred of 'em, and took &s;ome of 'em pri&s;oners, whom we gave quarter to for &s;ix or &s;even days; and then took them into a Wood, and cut them in pieces. The next night we rai&s;ed three Batte|ries, upon one of which we planted four large Pieces of Cannon, that were &s;ent us from <HI>Bantam,</HI> together with two thou&s;and Men. The&s;e were loaden immediately with Small Shot, in ca&s;e of their &s;allies in the night time; and in the day time we drew 'em out again, and loaded with Bullets, to &s;end into the Enemy's Works.</P>
<P>When we had lain here about &s;ix days before the Town, we began to make our Lines of Ap|proach;
<PB N="89" REF="53">
and a General A&s;&s;ault was agreed upon. In three days time we put it in execution: We had a Water to go over, which we pa&s;&s;ed with great ea&s;e, by means of &s;ome Fa&s;cines which our Blacks cut and laid for us; but we found &s;o brisk a reception, that we were forced to retire with a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of Men on our &s;ide. If the Ene|my had made the be&s;t of their opportunity at that time, they might, with the greate&s;t ea&s;e ima|ginable, have cut mo&s;t of us off, and rai&s;ed the Siege; but it plea&s;ed God they did not pur&s;ue us any further than their Works: And this was ow|ing chiefly to &s;ome Engli&s;h, who were among&s;t them, and who per&s;uaded them, that this was but a Sham-A&s;&s;ault of ours, and not the Body of our Army, and that that lay in the Trenches to cut off tho&s;e that &s;hould &s;ally out; which if they had done, they would have utterly routed us, for we were at fir&s;t but five thou&s;and &s;trong, (reckon|ing the two thou&s;and Men &s;ent us with the Can|non) and of them we had above an hundred killed, and an hundred and twenty wounded. Not|with&s;tanding this repul&s;e and di&s;advantage, we &s;till continued in our Re&s;olution of carrying on the Siege.</P>
<P>In the mean while our wounded Men were car|ried to a place about a mile di&s;tant from us, where there were ten Surgeons to look after them; and tho&s;e that were not dangerou&s;ly ill, were &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital at <HI>Bantam,</HI> and with them Captain <HI>Ruyter</HI> &s;ent a Letter to the Admiral, to de&s;ire him to &s;end him a recruit of about a thou&s;and Men; tel|ling him, that with that he did not doubt but he &s;hould get ma&s;ter of the Town in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Three days after our A&s;&s;ault we begun &s;till to make good our Approaches to the Town, being our number of Men increa&s;ed; and being come
<PB N="90" REF="54">
pretty near to it, the Blacks came over to us in in abundance out of the Town. We did not re|ceive them into our Army, but po&s;ted them be|tween our Lines and the Town: However, this gave us hopes, that the be&s;ieged were weary of us. Wherefore we begun to make ready &s;ome Mines, which being fini&s;hed, we again re&s;olved to make another A&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>While we were deliberating on the&s;e matters, an Engli&s;h Man, with his Arms, came over to us out of the Garri&s;on, and gave us a good account of their condition, and withal told the Captain, that the Be&s;ieged &s;eem'd now to wi&s;h for nothing more than that we would attempt another A&s;&s;ault; and that in order to receive us, they had pulled down the Hou&s;es in the Streets, and levell'd that part of the Town; that they had guarded all Avenues and Streets with double Palli&s;adoes, and that behind them they had planted &s;everal Pieces of Small Shot to receive us: And likewi&s;e that they had laid &s;everal Mines ready to blow us up. We on the other &s;ide were in hopes that we &s;hould &s;urmount all the&s;e difficulties. We mounted Mor|tars upon our Batteries, and &s;ent &s;uch a number of Bombs and Granadoes into the Town, that we thought it impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould keep within it long, and &s;o it proved; for by and by we heard a &s;udden Alarm, the Be&s;ieged having a mind to try the &s;ucce&s;s of a &s;econd Sally upon us. But we, who were well prepared for 'em upon all ac|counts, did &s;end &s;uch &s;hoals of Hand Granado's among&s;t them, that we forced them to retire with very great lo&s;s, and all the while we pur&s;ued them to the very Town.</P>
<P>This being done, and our two Mines being fi|ni&s;hed, and having laid &s;everal hundred weight of Gun-powder in each of them: Orders were given to &s;et fire to 'em, which was accordingly done:
<PB N="91" REF="54">
And in an in&s;tant, the Mines, having been dug very deep in under the Town, (as we might do ea&s;ily, the Town being &s;cituated pretty high,) we &s;aw half the Town in the Air, and &s;ome part of it, and of the Men came tumbling into our Camp; and within &s;ome thou&s;ands lo&s;t their Lives at that one blow.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this done, but we, who &s;tood all ready, and in expectation of this, ru&s;ht in furiou&s;ly upon them, while they were in this confu&s;ion and di&s;order, and put all to the Sword that came in our way, except tho&s;e that we &s;aw were Europeans. Two of them we took, who were Dutchmen, that had de&s;erted the Dutch Company, but the&s;e we immediately hung up without any further exami|nation, as it is the con&s;tant cu&s;tom, which the Dutch ob&s;erve when-ever they catch any of their De&s;erters. But be&s;ides that they de&s;erved this death by Law, they doubly merited this from us; for knowing that there was no pardon to be ex|pected from the Company, they had been great in&s;truments of the ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance we met with here; for their condition being de&s;perate, &s;o was the advice they gave to our Enemies, to hold out longer than they would have done. I could not but be exceedingly &s;orry at the fate of one of'em in particular, being one of my intimate acquain|tance, and who came over with me from <HI>Holland.</HI> He was of a very good Family, his Father was an eminent Merchant at <HI>Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway.</HI></P>
<P>Being now Ma&s;ters of this Pa&s;s, we fortified our &s;elves with the greate&s;t diligence, it being the &s;tronge&s;t In-land fortification, and the direct Pa&s;s from <HI>Bantam</HI> to <HI>Batavia</HI> by Land. We had already got all the Sea-port Towns and Forts in our Hands; and having likewi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed our &s;elves of this, we did not doubt but the Javians would be obliged to come and &s;urrender them&s;elves, &s;eeing they
<PB N="92" REF="55">
could not come at the Sea. Yet in ca&s;e there &s;hould be &s;ome &s;mall de&s;perate Parties abroad, Captain <HI>Ruyter</HI> commanded fifty Men to go and &s;troul a little about the Country, and I de&s;ired I might be one with 'em.</P>
<P>We marched about for a matter of an hour or or two, thro' nothing but Woods and Coco-Trees, and then we came to a River, but we could not pa&s;s it; &s;o we continued moving along the &s;ide of it till night; and then not meeting with a con|veniency of pa&s;&s;ing the River, we took up our lodging there that night; but for fear of the Ene|my, we hardly dur&s;t &s;peak or &s;tir all that night.</P>
<P>The next morning early we heard a noi&s;e not very far from us, and we began to fancy, that we might in&s;en&s;ibly be got round upon our Army again; but when we were got a little further, we di&s;covered the Enemy on the other &s;ide of the Ri|ver, as bu&s;ie as might be, cutting of Coco-Trees, with a de&s;ign to go and rai&s;e &s;ome new <HI>Bachers,</HI> as they call 'em, that is, Fortifications. The Ri|ver was very narrow, but very deep; and &s;eeing they could not come at us, and that we could ea|&s;ily retire (if need was) to our Army, which was but a mile from us; we took a re&s;olution, and fired &s;o briskly among&s;t them, that we fetch'd &s;e|veral of 'em down off the Trees.</P>
<P>They, on the other &s;ide, did not fail tomake good u&s;e of their Engli&s;h Firelocks, and to give fire upon us; &s;o that four of our Men fell. Two of them that were only wounded, I brought away, and appli'd what was requi&s;ite to their wounds; and having done that, I went forward to overtake the re&s;t of our Men; but I was no &s;ooner come up to them, but I my &s;elf received a wound in my Thigh, from a Black, that was upon a Coco-Tree, and the Ball lodged within me. The &s;mall Skirmi&s;h be|ing over, &s;ome of our Men took me up, and carri|ed
<PB N="93" REF="55">
me to <HI>Anier,</HI> where the Army was; and from thence I was carried to the Ho&s;pital at <HI>Bantam.</HI> There I was the daily care of the chief Surgeon of that place, who was a very able Man, named <HI>John Han&s;s</HI> a Leydener.</P>
<P>He u&s;ed his utmo&s;t endeavours to get the Bullet out of the wound, but all in vain: And after I had undergone a long and grievous pain, and had all the Splinters clear'd out, we were forced to leave the Bullet in, and to let the wound heal over it.</P>
<P>In two months time I was fully recover'd, and found no pain; nor did my Bullet ever trouble me, till I came into <HI>Holland</HI> again.</P>
<P>I was now got again to my Employment, in the Ho&s;pital that was committed to my care, where we enjoy'd our &s;elves with great &s;ecurity: Only for fear of the wor&s;t, we took care to man our outward Garri&s;ons, and to fortifie our Frontier Places. But e're three Months were at an end, we were &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied that there was no great need of fortifying our &s;elves any more; for the Javians came over to us in mighty numbers: And to convince us of their &s;incerity, and entire &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion to us, they &s;ent us &s;ome hundreds of Carts full of Mu&s;quets, Lances, Pikes, Bows and Arrows, and other Warlike In&s;truments.</P>
<P>After this, &s;ome of their Nobility, and &s;ome Per|&s;ons of greate&s;t Note, who had great E&s;tates in tho&s;e parts, came to &s;urrender them&s;elves, and to beg for Pardon of the Dutch Company. But for that time the Company thought fit to leave that to the di&s;cretion of the Young King, who pretend|ed him&s;elf willing to receive them graciou&s;ly, and to pardon all that was pa&s;t. But he having got &s;ome of 'em into his power, he forgot his Royal Word, and commanded &s;ome of them to be ca&s;t to Tygers, &s;ome to Venemous Serpents, &s;ome to be

&s;trangled, others were drown'd, others had their Throats cut by his e&s;pecial Command; and all va|riou&s;ly and mi&s;erably put to death. Things being come to this pa&s;s, the Company thought it was high time to put a &s;top to &s;uch Barbarity: And therefore they acquainted him with their re&s;ent|ment of this his ba&s;e dealing, and made him &s;en|&s;ible of the great imprudence, as well as ba&s;ene&s;s he had been guilty of; &s;eeing he ought to have been glad, to have &s;een the&s;e Per&s;ons come to &s;ub|mit them&s;elves to him, and furni&s;h him with Sub|jects which he was now like to want; and that &s;o he might have his Towns and Cities once again rai&s;ed, and filled with Inhabitants. The re&s;t of them that came in, being hereupon more civilly u&s;ed, and kindly treated; in&s;omuch that in the eighteen Months time that I was there, all the Places were rebuilt, and made finer than they were before. For then the Chinee&s;es, who are willing to be under the Dutch Government, came and &s;ettled there in grea|ter numbers than ever. For as they love to live among the Dutch, becau&s;e of the Priviledges they give them; &s;o the Dutch are very glad of their company, becau&s;e where-ever they are among them, they cau&s;e a brisk Trade, which turns to the ad|vantage of the Dutch, as well as of the Chinee&s;es them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Country being now again pretty well Peo|pled with Neighbours and Forreigners, and by the coming in of the Javians; I thought it high time to look about me, and to try to recruit my Pockets, which were now very low, all Provi&s;ions being exceeding dear; and I had had no opportunity in a great while to get a Farthing by my Profe&s;&s;ion, any other than what my Salary brought me in. So I applied my &s;elf to the Javians, among whom I thought there might be a great many wounded, and accordingly I found pretty much practice
<PB N="95" REF="57">
among&s;t 'em. With all this help I made &s;hift to live hand&s;omly enough, but truly it was as much as I could do: For con&s;idering the &s;carcity there was, and the great fatigues I had born, as well as the re&s;t, I thought it the prudente&s;t way to look af|ter my Health, and to afford my &s;elf what my Con&s;titution required, rather than pinch my &s;elf, and contract a fit of Sickne&s;s, as &s;everal, and in|deed mo&s;t People do, who go over to the Indies with no other de&s;ign but to enrich them&s;elves at any rate. Tho', by the by, after all the pinching, &s;aving and &s;craping together, that is not &s;o ea&s;ily done, as People imagine: For nothing is more common than the vulgar opinion, that there's no more to be done to get an E&s;tate, than ju&s;t to go to the Indies; from whence they reckon they may come home with a burden of Gold, Pearls and Di|amonds, as if it was but picking them up and come away. But it may be worth the while, &s;eeing we are &s;peaking of this Vulgar Error, to &s;hew that the&s;e pretious things are &s;o far from being thus ea|&s;ie to come at, that it is even a very dangerous thing to attempt to carry off any of tho&s;e things, if a Man hath got any of them in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I my &s;elf went once to <HI>Amboyna,</HI> and got inti|mately acquainted there with a Sergeant, that had lived about nineteen years in that Country, and was an Over&s;eer over &s;everal Blacks, that work in <HI>Pre&s;s-Mills.</HI> We came to trucking at la&s;t, and I exchanged &s;ome of my Chee&s;e, Tobacco, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for for &s;ome Oyl of Cloves; of which I purcha&s;ed &s;even Bottles of near two Quarts a piece. This exchange of ours was to be kept as &s;ecret as any Robbery one &s;hould commit in Europe, for both our Lives lay at &s;take. Fortune favour'd me &s;o far, that I came away undi&s;cover'd, and brought 'em &s;afe into the Road of <HI>Batavia;</HI> where I be|gan to have &s;ome hopes of running it a&s;hoar, and
<PB N="96" REF="58">
plea&s;ed my &s;elf with the thoughts of what it would yeild me among the Chinee&s;es, and the Engli&s;h. But I reckon'd without my Ho&s;t there; for no &s;ooner was I got into the Boat, in order to get to Shoar, with one of our Seamen, whom I had made privy to the bu&s;ine&s;s, and who under&s;tood that Trade, but the <HI>Fi&s;cael</HI> made towards us with his <HI>Caffers.</HI> The Seaman had &s;o contrived the bu&s;ine&s;s, that the Bottles were under water well &s;topt, and tied to a Cord; but when we found the <HI>Caffers</HI> came direct|ly to us, the Seaman who &s;tood ready with a Knife in his hand, cut the Cord, and dropt the Bottles into the Sea. The <HI>Caffers</HI> were immedi|ately with us, who &s;earched our Boat very narrow|ly, and then with their Hooks groped all round the out&s;ide: They found nothing but the end of a Cord, which made them give us an Ugly Look, but it was not &s;ufficient to bring us into any fur|ther trouble. But immediately upon this a poor Gentleman had much harder fortune than I had; for the&s;e <HI>Caffars</HI> going from us to a Ship, that was come along with us from the We&s;tern Coa&s;t, they caught a Lieutenant there, that had got a piece of Gold of &s;ome pounds weight: And the <HI>Fi&s;cael</HI> carried him &s;trait away to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and in two days time he was hang'd up in the <HI>Galgeveld.</HI> This poor Man's hard Lot made me not regret my lo&s;s &s;o much, I rather hug'd my &s;elf that I had let my Tartar go. But it cured me from ever at|tempting any thing of that nature. This may &s;erve to let you &s;ee, how dangerous &s;uch un|dertakings are; and that &s;uch Counterband-Goods are not &s;o ea&s;ily brought off.

But now to return again to where I was: I ought not to omit giving the Reader an account, which will not be unacceptable, tho' the action will rather amaze than delight, and mu&s;t needs fill the Reader with horror: For of all the Cruel|ty I ever heard of there, I never met with any that could compare with this, which was com|mitted in my time, tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s I think the Puni&s;hment that was inflicted on the Malef<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">ctors did in &s;ome mea&s;ure out-do it.</P>
<P>Some of our Men went one day a little way up into the Country, rather out of nece&s;&s;ity than for plea&s;ure, de&s;igning to &s;hoot &s;ome Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> notwith&s;tanding they might know well enough, that it was not very &s;afe, being we were not altoge|ther reconciled with the Javians. They were ex|pected back at night, but three days pa&s;t, and no news of 'em, which occa&s;ioned many conjectures; but mo&s;t were of opinion, that &s;ome Javians had faln upon them, and murdered them. Upon which <HI>Minheer Tack</HI> commanded a Lieutenant, with &s;ome Men, to go in &s;earch after 'em. Having wan|der'd a matter of two hours, they came to a lone&s;ome place, whereas they were thinking to go back, and take &s;ome other Road. They heard a piteous out-cry, which made them go forward to &s;ee what it was, and there they found 'em all &s;ix, and di&s;covered the mo&s;t di&s;mal Spectacle that ever was.</P>
<P>One of them was &s;tretch'd out between two Trees, with his Arms tied to the one, and his Legs to the other, about three or four yards high from the ground, with a great Fire &s;till burning under him; but he was quite roa&s;ted when we came.</P>
<P>Another hung by his Privities upon another Tree, with his Arms and Legs tied together under his Back; this was dead al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="59">
The third was &s;pitted upon a Bamboo-cane, in at his Fundament and out at his Mouth; he was dead too.</P>
<P>The fourth was buried up to the Neck, his Eyes put out, and his No&s;e and Ears cut off; this was not quite dead.</P>
<P>The fifth and &s;ixth were tied fa&s;t Back to Back, each of them had their Right Eyes put out, and their Privities thru&s;t into the holes; both the&s;e were &s;till alive.</P>
<P>Our Men were &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed at this &s;ight, that they were ready to &s;ink down; and finding no other remedy, they came with all &s;peed to <HI>Min|heer Tack,</HI> to give him this tragical account, who &s;ent &s;traight &s;ome Blacks with a Barrow to fetch the&s;e poor Creatures, and bring them to <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P>We were not a little concerned at this &s;trange accident, but what was an addition to our trouble was, that we could not learn from the&s;e Men how they came to be thus &s;erved, becau&s;e they were de|prived of their In&s;trument of Speech.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Tack</HI> &s;ent immediately &s;ome Me&s;&s;en|gers to the Young King to acquaint him with all this, and to de&s;ire him to have a &s;earch made among his people, and to u&s;e all means po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover the Authors of this Fact. This he did, and with &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s, that in le&s;s than a fortnights time, we found the Rogues out; and all of 'em (being &s;ixteen in number) were apprehend|ed, and eight of them were forthwith condemn'd to be thrown to Serpents.</P>
<P>The manner of the&s;e Serpents de&s;troying of Men is thus. They catch hold of a Man, and &s;wallow him near half up, and then &s;uck all the Blood out of his Body, then they tear him peace-meal, and eat him up.</P>
<P>The other eight were confined to one Room, where they had very good Diet afforded them, but
<PB N="99" REF="59">
that was only in order to prolong their Pain; for there were Men always attending them with Scour|ges; and as &s;oon as ever the&s;e Criminals begun to nod, they la&s;hed them &s;everely, and this continu|ed for a fortnight; and then they begg'd that we would knock them on the Head, or put 'em to any &s;peedy death they plea&s;ed, tho' it were the mo&s;t cruel they could invent.</P>
<P>But all their begging was in vain, for the Young King was wonderfully plea&s;ed, that he had found out &s;uch a Puni&s;hment, as would probably terrifie the re&s;t from committing &s;uch frequent Murders as they u&s;ed to do.</P>
<P>Thus they continued in that mi&s;ery, and lived till the fifth Week; then they fell a&s;leep in &s;pight of all their Whipping; and continued &s;o notwith|&s;tanding they were pincht with red hot Tongs, and &s;o they ended their mi&s;erable Lives. So, that how barbarous &s;oever their Fact was, yet it met with a Puni&s;hment, which, I think, did rather out-do the Fact it &s;elf in Barbarity.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How in&s;olently the Javians behaved them&s;elves at fir&s;t towards the Dutch, and how civili|zed. The Dutch get the total Government of the Country into their Hands by con&s;ent of the Toung King. The Old Kings Surrender, Confinement and Death. Rebuilding of <HI>Ban|tam,</HI> and it's flouri&s;hing Condition. Its Traf|fick, Commodities, Fruits and Provi&s;ions. Tygers there in great numbers, how catch'd. Elephants taken after a like manner in <HI>Cey|lon,</HI> and <HI>Aracan.</HI> The &s;everal Games and Pa&s;times at the Weddings of the Chief Javi|ans, together with &s;ome Cu&s;toms and Ceremo|nies u&s;ed on tho&s;e occa&s;ions. A de&s;cription of Pepper, and its growth. The Author's de|parture from <HI>Bantam</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and thence to <HI>Banda.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Javians could hardly bear the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for a great while, and truly their antipathy again&s;t us was not altogether without &s;ome grounds, &s;eeing that we, being Forreigners, had invaded their Territories, and taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all they had, and then lorded it over them. They being a very &s;illy &s;ort of People, had no other way to &s;hew their Spight and Re&s;entment, than by making Mouths at the Dutch as they pa&s;&s;ed by, and &s;ome|times Spitting upon them. To break them of that ungainly Cu&s;tom, we made a re&s;olution among&s;t
<PB N="101" REF="60">
us, never to let any pa&s;s by that did &s;o, whether Old or Young, Man or Woman, without giving them a good Box on the Ear. This cured them of their incivility &s;o effectually, that you'ld have wonder'd to &s;ee how courteou&s;ly they behaved them&s;elves towards us; for all of a &s;udden there was &s;o great an alteration, that there was no pa&s;|&s;ing by 'em, but they would greet you very civilly, give you good morrow, (in their Language, <HI>Dobi|dis Sinior)</HI> clapping their Hands together, and holding them up to their Forehead; and when they were willing to &s;hew them&s;elves more cour|teous and officious, they would add, <HI>Manna Bigi Sinior,</HI> that is, where are you going Sir? which was as much as offering their &s;ervice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which we frequently made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Tack</HI> was all this while lodg'd in the A|partment which belonged before to the Engli&s;h, where the Young King u&s;ed to come to vi&s;it him almo&s;t every day, and maintain'd a faithful Friend&s;hip with him. In a little time, things being &s;ettled, a Propo&s;al was made to the Young King by the Dutch, that if he would re&s;ign intirely all claim of Power and Juri&s;diction over his People, cu|&s;tom, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and turn over the whole Government in|to their Hands, they would allow him &s;uch a Sum as would enable him to keep up his Grandeur, and live like a King, (a titular one, that is,) and would be obliged to pay him &s;ome thou&s;ands of Gilders every Month. To this he conde&s;cended; whether thro' fear, or thro' indifference, I cannot well &s;ay; and a certain Pen&s;ion was likewi&s;e &s;ettled upon his two Young Princes, all which was duly paid ac|cording to agreement. The re&s;t of the Nobility, and Chief of the Land, remained in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Goods and Lands, as before, only that they were now &s;ubject to the Dutch Government. Thus the Dutch compa&s;&s;ed their whole de&s;ign by force
<PB N="102" REF="61">
and policy; and by fair means became Ma&s;ters of that Kingdom, which was, and had been &s;o long flouri&s;hing, and famous for its va&s;t Trade and traf|fick; and that in &s;o little time, as from 1682 to 1685, that I believe Hi&s;tory will hardly afford an in&s;tance of a more &s;udden change of Affairs in &s;o great a Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Old King all this while having wander'd up and down on the <HI>Blawen Peper Bergh,</HI> whither he had been forced to retire when he was defeated; and being there for&s;aken by mo&s;t of his People, re|&s;olved al&s;o to come, and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the Dutch Company; and accordingly, after near two years, he came and &s;urrendred him&s;elf, having fir&s;t &s;ent &s;ome of his Servants to Admiral <HI>Tack</HI> for his Pardon, which was granted him. Upon which he appeared in Per&s;on, and came to <HI>Bantam,</HI> with a very &s;mall Retinue; there they a&s;&s;igned him a Lodg|ing, and &s;et Guard upon him, and in a little time after &s;ent him to a &s;mall I&s;land, where he ended his days.</P>
<P>Thus all being quiet, all Ho&s;tilities cea&s;ed, and all reduced to one Government, <HI>Bantam</HI> flouri&s;hed again in a more perfect manner than it had ever done; and did, like a Phoenix, &s;pring up out of its own A&s;hes, but more beautiful and &s;trong than it was before. Its Borders were now va&s;tly enlarged, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t number of Foreigners, which daily flocked thither, and were all indifferently re|ceived, except the Engli&s;h, French and Danes, which were not admitted, but were &s;ent with their Ships to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where they were permitted to trade, and to take Hou&s;es and Ware-hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Traffick of <HI>Bantam</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>Pepper, Salt-Peter, Salt, Ginger, Cotten-Cloth</HI> plain, and wrought with <HI>Silver</HI> and <HI>Gold;</HI> al&s;o <HI>Fine Linnen,</HI> and <HI>Flowerd Stuffs,</HI> which are the common wear of the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="61">
The Country about it is exceeding plea&s;ant, and produces all manner of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. There are all manner of tame Fowls, Hens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and their Eggs very cheap. All &s;orts of Fi&s;h. Great &s;tore of Cows and Buffels, but the Fat of the&s;e la&s;t is not much eaten, becau&s;e it ta&s;ts &s;o much like Tallow. Many Wild Boars there are al&s;o, but the Tame&s;t of that kind that ever was, becau&s;e that the Javi|ans never hunted them, by rea&s;on that their Law doth not permit them to eat the Fle&s;h of 'em; &s;o that they u&s;ed to come &s;o clo&s;e up to our Works, that I have &s;hot three or four of 'em in one day, and &s;old them for little or nothing.</P>
<P>But the wor&s;t Cattle thereabouts is the Ty|gers, which are in great numbers near <HI>Bantam,</HI> which the Javians u&s;ed to be frequently &s;ent out to catch or kill: And they did it after this manner.</P>
<P>Thou&s;ands of Javians go together to the place where the Tygers lie; and there they &s;pread them|&s;elves round the place in about three miles com|pa&s;s, and &s;o march gradually to center and meet upon the Tyger, keeping &s;till their <HI>Na&s;&s;ingayen</HI> before them; &s;o that if the Tygers come out to|wards the circumference they make, they are &s;o frighted, that they run back again; and &s;o they keep them running to and fro, and retiring, till at la&s;t they are &s;o clo&s;ely encompa&s;&s;ed, that they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be forced to throw them&s;elves into &s;ome of their Traps, which are &s;omething after the manner of our Wheel-nets, but incomparably &s;tron|ger and bigger; for they are of &s;trong Wood, made le&s;s and le&s;s, and &s;everal Partitions; and in each Partition a Trap-door that &s;huts upon 'em, till at la&s;t they come into the narrowe&s;t of all. There they let him alone a good while without Meat, then they get a Rope about his Neck, and put him into a &s;mall Coop, upon a Cart drawn by Buffels; and the&s;e are always brought to the King,
<PB N="104" REF="62">
who keeps always &s;ome of 'em in his Palace, and looks upon that as a piece of great State. And when one of them brings forth a young one, it is &s;o much taken notice of, that all the Cannon round the Ca&s;tle are di&s;charged, and great Rejoy|cings and Pa&s;times are made upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>They do breed very often, but tho' one might expect to bring the young ones to be perfectly Tame, as indeed &s;ome do pretty well come to it, yet it is never &s;afe to tru&s;t them too far; for while I was there, two of 'em, which they thought as tame as they could wi&s;h, broke loo&s;e and run thro' the Town, and tore &s;everal People to pieces, and would have de&s;troyed &s;everal more, had not &s;ome Javians come upon them, arm'd with their <HI>Na&s;|&s;ingays,</HI> who killed one of them, and took the other.</P>
<P>There is another way of catching them in Traps, laying a Bait for 'em, but then you can't have them alive; &s;o there is &s;hooting of 'em, but not with|out very great danger.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ceylon, Pegu</HI> and <HI>Aracan</HI> they u&s;e to catch Elephants much after the &s;ame manner. It is worth while, upon this occa&s;ion, to undeceive tho&s;e &s;imple and credulous People, who believe that the way to catch them is, to &s;aw &s;ome Trees almo&s;t thro', again&s;t which the Elephants come to lean to take their re&s;t; and &s;o the Tree falling, they likewi&s;e fall, and are not able to get up again, being very clum&s;ie, and without Joynts in their Legs. Whoever gives credit to this Fable, is ea&s;i|ly impo&s;ed upon, for con&s;idering the Bulk of 'em, there is not a more nimble and active Creature than they are; and nothing is more &s;ure, than that when they are u&s;ed in War, there are never any Ladders made u&s;e of, to help up the three or four Soldiers, which they carry; but they are taught to kneel, or rather couch down, while they get
<PB N="105" REF="62">
upon their Backs. But their Agility is &s;o ob&s;er|vable from what we have &s;een &s;ome of 'em do in Europe, that I will not go about to de&s;cribe them any further. But for one in&s;tance of their Nim|blene&s;s, and Aptne&s;s to be taught any thing, I cannot but &s;et down here what I was an Eye-witne&s;s of my &s;elf, done by an Elephant which one of the chief Merchants of the Company kept of his own, that had abundance of Tricks. And when he had a mind to divert him&s;elf, or &s;ome &s;pecial Compa|ny, he would have him brought out by the Men that lookt after him, and knew how to manage him. This Elephant once was brought out upon a Bridge, which was over a very deep River, and a great Loaf was given him in his Mouth. The keeper gave him a &s;ign, and fell a beating upon a Copper In&s;trument; upon which the Elephant went back, as in a fright, and tumbled down backwards into the River, with a mo&s;t hidious plunge, and kept &s;o long under water, that he eat up his Loaf there, and he &s;taid &s;o very long under the water, that no body expected ever to have &s;een him come up again, except tho&s;e that were u&s;ed to this trick; at la&s;t up he came and &s;wam to Shore, and ha|ving paid his re&s;pects to his Ma&s;ter, he threw up the Bread he had eaten, and near a Barrel full of water. Many other Tricks he &s;hewed, but this is the only one that I thought worth relating, as be|ing &s;omewhat &s;trange and uncommon.</P>
<P>I u&s;ed to frequent many Javians of my acquain|tance, to pa&s;s away the time, and to ob&s;erve &s;ome of their mo&s;t particular Cu&s;toms and Humours, and to &s;hare of their Diver&s;ions. Of th' latter none plea&s;ed me more, than to &s;ee their <HI>Balliar</HI> Dances, performed by Women who were kept for that purpo&s;e, by Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality. The&s;e Women are of an extraordinary &s;mall &s;ize, but of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Form and perfect Shape
<PB N="106" REF="63">
that ever was &s;een: Their height is but between five and &s;ix Spans, their Skin as white as the driven Snow; and taking them all together, one would &s;ooner take 'em for Angels, in the likene&s;s of Wo|men, than for Women them&s;elves; for be&s;ides their natural Beauty, there is all the artificial Dre&s;s that can be contrived. Their Garments are of the &s;ine&s;t Silks, wrought with Silver and Gold, and their Tre&s;&s;es neatly adorn'd with the rare&s;t Orient Pearls, all which doth &s;till add to their lu&s;tre. Their manner of dancing is in Ma&s;querade; they have in their Hands &s;ome Ebbony Balls &s;trung upon a String, with which they keep time very ex|actly with the Mu&s;ick, in&s;tead of our Ca&s;tanets; and &s;ometimes they &s;ing with their dancing, which is yet more charming than the re&s;t, their Voice be|ing wonderful &s;weet. One of the&s;e Women co&s;ts generally two or three thou&s;and Gilders, they are fetch'd out of the Province of <HI>Babylon,</HI> about forty miles from <HI>Jerico</HI> the le&s;s; and no other Women are fit for the&s;e kind of Pa&s;times and Dances but they: So they are much made of by the Indian Kings, and Nobility, who &s;pare no pains nor charge to get 'em. Some of the&s;e I have &s;een al&s;o at <HI>Surat</HI> and in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> when I lay before <HI>Wond Artz,</HI> with the Ship called the <HI>Gelderland,</HI> where we took in Silks in lieu of our Pepper and Spices.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of Sport they have is Cockfighting, which being &s;o common here, needs no further de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>The&s;e Sports and Pa&s;times are frequently &s;een among&s;t 'em, but e&s;pecially at their Weddings, which are never held without them, together with &s;everal other Recreations, and &s;trange Ceremonies, of which I will give you &s;ome account.</P>
<P>In the time that I was there, a young Gentle|man, Son to one of the Principal among&s;t 'em, was
<PB N="107" REF="63">
married; and being intimately acquainted with him, I was invited to that Wedding. His Wife's Porti|on was con&s;iderable, and proportioned to the Young Gentleman's Fortune. The Father gave with his Daughter, thirty Men, forty Women, and twenty Young Maids, all Slaves, be&s;ides two hun|dred thou&s;and <HI>Cujax,</HI> which amounteth to about &s;ixteen Rixdollers, for twelve thou&s;and <HI>Cujax</HI> are only the value of a piece of eight. All the&s;e Wo|men-&s;laves, the Man may lie with if he plea&s;eth, but the Children that are thus born, are not at his di&s;po&s;al, but at his Wives, who may &s;ell them, or di&s;po&s;e of them as &s;he thinks fit. But tho&s;e Slaves Children, which are given in Dowry to the Wife, are in the power of the Husband to order as he will.</P>
<P>When a Marriage is on foot among them, both the Young People confine them&s;elves within, for about &s;ix Weeks or two Months: The Parents in that time &s;et out their Servants and Slaves, and make 'em as fine as they can again&s;t the Wedding. The Bridegrooms Apartment is all &s;trewed with Flow|ers. Then on the Wedding day he mounts on a Fine Hor&s;e, which is &s;et out in the fine&s;t manner, and thus goes to his Bride, where all her Friends meet him, attended with the Slaves, Pre&s;ents and Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then a great Dinner is pre|pared, where each of the Young Peoples Parents are to be pre&s;ent, and to make merry. In the mean while the Young Couple are lead to a Room with a fine Bed in it; where they are &s;hut in, and left to their liberty, after which the Bridegroom comes out to the Gue&s;ts, but the Bride is not &s;een of any Man after that time.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rejoycings u&s;ually la&s;t four days, during which there are &s;ome Comedies acted after the Chinee&s;e manner.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="64">
Among all their Sports, there is their baiting of a Buffle, which plea&s;ed me very well, but that it &s;o frequently occa&s;ions much mi&s;chief; becau&s;e their way is to leave them loo&s;e, and to &s;et &s;eve|ral Engli&s;h Dogs upon them. I &s;aw my &s;elf once two Buffels let loo&s;e in a &s;mall inclo&s;ed piece of ground, with five Dogs again&s;t 'em. One of the Buffels de&s;ended him&s;elf very well of the fir&s;t Dog that came at him, and to&s;&s;ed him up a va&s;t height; but a &s;econd coming upon him, before he had well rid him&s;elf of the fir&s;t, and &s;eizing him fa&s;t by the Te&s;ticles, it &s;o enraged the Buffel, that he run directly to a little Shed, that &s;tood there in a Corner, upon which three Blacks and two Dutchmen had got, the better to &s;ee the Sport; and throwing all down before him, and the Dogs &s;till holding him fa&s;t, three of them, <HI>viz.</HI> two Javians, and a Dutch Carpenter, were trampled to death, and indeed almo&s;t all to pieces: And the other Javian, with the Admiral's Baker, came off luckily with no other wound, than what they got by their fall: They had no other way to put an end to this, or to part 'em, but by firing upon them altogether; for now the other Buffel was deeply engaged too: So that with their Mu&s;quets they killed the two Buffels, and two of the Dogs, and unfortunately another Javian. So that this Sport ended very tragically, and it generally proves &s;o, thro' their want of management.</P>
<P>The next day another ill accident happen'd; for as there was in that place a great Ma&s;t, which the Engli&s;h had taken formerly out of a Ship, and &s;et up there, in order to get up, and &s;py the Ships a-far off at Sea. One of our Seamen would needs go up for a frolick, and being come almo&s;t to the top, one of his holds broke, and let him down, and was (as you may well imagine) killed with the fall. Upon which Admiral <HI>Tack</HI> immediately
<PB N="109" REF="64">
ordered this Ma&s;t to be cut down, and another to be &s;et up upon the <HI>Speelwick</HI> Ba&s;tion, which was much le&s;s than the other, and not near &s;o high, but commanded a farther pro&s;pect, the Ba&s;tion it &s;elf being very high, and upon a much higher ground.</P>
<P>While I re&s;ided in the Ho&s;pital at <HI>Bantam,</HI> which was &s;ome Months, &s;everal of our Compa|ny, which we had left at <HI>Dorja&s;&s;e,</HI> dropt in by degrees, having de&s;troyed all in their way; and being all come in, they were almo&s;t all &s;ent back again to <HI>Batavia,</HI> e&s;pecially all the Blacks; &s;o that there were not left, both within, and with|out the Ca&s;tle, above five thou&s;and Men to keep the Garri&s;on; which was little enough for &s;o great a place, it being as far as I can judge four|teen or. fifteen miles in circuit: and the number of its Inhabitants was computed to be 700000, be&s;ides the Foreigners, which might amount to half the number more.</P>
<P>Towards Land the City lies open, but to the Sea it is guarded by a very &s;trong Wall &s;ix yards broad; be&s;ides &s;ome hundreds of Ba&s;tions, little Forts, Redoubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which are very well pro|vided with Cannon.</P>
<P>All things were now in good order, and the Go|vernment very prudently managed, &s;o that all tho&s;e that were in the Companies Service, even the Soldiers them&s;elves, had no rea&s;on to com|plain. But their Condition was much mended, their Provi&s;ions were cheap, and their U&s;age and Treatment very civil; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I had all the enjoyment I could well wi&s;h: But notwith&s;tanding all this, I was &s;till di&s;&s;atisfied and re&s;tle&s;s, and wanted to be going to vi&s;it &s;ome other parts of the Indies. But it was in vain to wi&s;h, for I was under Obligations not to move yet.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="65">
The time now drawing near, that our Captain was to return to <HI>Batavia;</HI> a Council of War was held, where it was re&s;olved, that a general Mu|&s;ter &s;hould be made, and that tho&s;e who had &s;er|ved out their time, &s;hould come out and claim their liberty: But withal notice was given them, that if they would engage them&s;elves afre&s;h, they &s;hould not only be kindly received, but &s;hould have their Pay rai&s;ed by four Gilders.</P>
<P>Then our Captain <HI>Tack</HI> went back to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to be Pre&s;ident of that City, and Captain <HI>Harzing</HI> &s;ucceeded him in his place of Governour of <HI>Ban|tam.</HI></P>
<P>About this time the <HI>Muck Speelers</HI> were very trouble&s;om about the City, and daily committing great di&s;orders. Their way is to make them&s;elves mad by eating of the Herb they call <HI>Avion, i. e.</HI> Opium: Then ye &s;hall &s;ee 'em run about the Streets, like Men di&s;tracted, and kill all they meet. But our cu&s;tom was, as &s;oon as we &s;pied them a coming, to cry out <HI>Amuck, Amuck,</HI> upon which every body &s;tood ready with his Weapon in his hand; and the&s;e Blockheads would run them&s;elves upon a Pike, or upon a Mu&s;quet, and be &s;hot through, and in the heat of the Fury, run it may be an hundred or two hundred paces before they dropt. And the&s;e Di&s;orders could not by any means be prevented, tho' the Company had made it death for any one to be found with any of that Herb about him, in any part of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI></P>
<P>There being now no more Action here, nor any Novelty that this Place afforded me, I was very de&s;irous to be gone. But I found the only way to attain my wi&s;h, was to get &s;ome Sea-Surgeon in the mind to exchange Places with me. Wherefore I waited impatiently for the coming in of any Ships that were to go to <HI>Batavia:</HI> And in a little time the <HI>Tidor,</HI> from <HI>Bali,</HI> came into the Road of
<PB N="111" REF="65">
<HI>Bantam.</HI> She had no &s;ooner ca&s;t Anchor, but I was with her to welcome her, and to feel the Pul&s;es of her Surgeons; but I found their De&s;igns were much the &s;ame as mine, and they were all di&s;pos'd for a longer Cour&s;e; &s;o that I found no hopes there of &s;ucce&s;s: But being told that they expect|ed another Ship in toward night, if the Wind did not cro&s;s 'em, wherein were four Ma&s;ter Surge|ons; my hopes quickly revived, and I re&s;olved to &s;tay there that Night; in the Evening the Ship came in according to their expectation, and the next Morning early I went on board of it; and after the u&s;ual &s;alutations, I applied my &s;elf to the Ma&s;ter Surgeons, and freely declared to 'em my Intentions. One of 'em, a Gentleman of <HI>Delf,</HI> at fir&s;t liked my Propo&s;al, and after &s;ome further di&s;cour&s;e, was fully in the re&s;olution of changing with me, which did not a little rejoyce me. The thing being thus agreed upon, he asked leave of the Captain, after having acquainted him with his de&s;ign; and having got his leave, he came away with me to Shore My bu&s;ine&s;s now was to have leave my &s;elf, which indeed I had moved for at a di&s;tance before, but not doubting of having leave given me when-ever I &s;hould de&s;ire it, becau&s;e I had behaved my &s;elf well; and what made more yet on my &s;ide, I had now and then grea&s;ed the Chief Surgeons Fi&s;t: I deferr'd &s;peaking for it directly, till I had met with one that would change with me. No &s;ooner had I declared my Mind to the Chief Surgeon, but he gave me an ample and ho|nourable <HI>Te&s;timonium</HI> to carry to the Governour, who with a Complement of Thanks, gave me a Pa&s;s, and entred the other in my Place. So I took my leave of 'em all; and having got my Che&s;t and Hammock ready, I got me a-board my new Ship, called the <HI>Enckhuy&s;en,</HI> it was laden with nothing but Rice, and had but twenty eight
<PB N="112" REF="66">
Seamen, be&s;ides the Officers, and us four Ma&s;ter-Surgeons.</P>
<P>I parted very chearfully from <HI>Bantam,</HI> the only thing that I was loath to part with was, a little Summer-Hou&s;e I had order'd to be made in the Garden of the Ho&s;pital, which was very delight|ful. It was made of Bamboos, and &s;o contrived, that I might have removed it very well; but be|ing I could not move that with it, which made it &s;o extream plea&s;ant, I left the whole &s;tanding for my Succe&s;&s;or to enjoy, but not without grudging it him heartily. The Top of it was cover'd very neatly with Fig-leaves, and the Sides were &s;weetly &s;haded with Pepper-planks, which hung like a Vine over the Windows, and made it extreamly agreeable. But now that I am &s;peaking of this Pep|per, it will not be ami&s;s to give you a de&s;cription of its growth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This part of <HI>Java</HI> is the mo&s;t famous for it, and the great <HI>Blauwe Peper Bergh,</HI> which I have &s;o often mentioned, hath its denomi|nation from it, and &s;ignifies <HI>Blew-Pepper-Mountain,</HI> it being full of it; there the be&s;t of all grows. Indeed <HI>Malabar, Malacca</HI> and <HI>Sumatra</HI> do produce va&s;t quantities of it too, but it is all white and long, like the <HI>Canary</HI> Pepper, and is not to com|pare with the <HI>Javian</HI> Pepper for goodne&s;s; and for that rea&s;on hardly any but the latter is tran&s;|ported into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They plant it at the bottom of other Trees, to which it clings in the nature of our Hops, and winds round as that does, but higher. Its Leaf is like that of the Orange-Trees, but le&s;s, and of a more plea&s;ant Green, and ta&s;ts pretty &s;harp if one bites 'em. The Fruit grows much like Grapes, tho' (every one knows) much &s;maller, and clo&s;er to one another&punc; They are ever green till they dry, which is in <HI>November, December</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> at which time they gather 'em, and &s;pread them upon
<PB N="113" REF="66">
Mats in the Sun to dry; then they run 'em thro' a Sieve, and pack 'em up ready for the Merchants to take away.</P>
<P>Now, tho' Pepper is as plenty in <HI>India</HI> as Stones in the Streets, and only &s;erves for Balla&s;t very of|ten, and to pack up other Goods tire; and altho' &s;ometimes &s;everal whole Shiploads of it be thrown into the Sea, and many hundred thou&s;and pound weight of it burnt; yet dares no Man in the &s;er|vice of the Company take one &s;ingle Corn of it, but every one is obliged to buy it of the Indians, who deal with the Company for it: And the &s;ame rule is ob&s;ervable in re&s;pect to other Spices. But now the <HI>Enckhuy&s;en</HI> lay &s;till but one day, &s;o that the next morning after I had boarded her, we weighed Anchor and &s;ailed to <HI>Batavia,</HI> with a half wind. It lies but &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Bantam,</HI> yet were we &s;even days before we could reach it, for we were ever and anon forced to ca&s;t Anchor and weigh it again, which fatigued our Men mightily.</P>
<P>Being now come before <HI>Batavia,</HI> our Ma&s;ter went immediately on Shore, and the next day our Ship was unlading. I went to Shore too with all &s;peed in a Chinee&s;e <HI>Praw,</HI> and went to wait upon the Head Surgeon there, one Mr. <HI>John Streckel|berger,</HI> who was my old Acquaintance; but I found him now rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t pitch of Pre|ferment the Profe&s;&s;ion is capable of there, which was the place of Over&s;eer General over all the Sur|geons in the whole Indies, in the place of Dr. <HI>Kle|yer.</HI> I told him upon what de&s;ign I had left <HI>Bantam</HI> to come to <HI>Batavia,</HI> which was in order to get me a Deputation to &s;ome other part of <HI>India,</HI> that I might travel farther &s;till. He &s;eemed very ready at the fir&s;t, but afterwards he de&s;ired me to come again in three or four days time.</P>
<P>In the mean while I went to vi&s;it all my old Acquaintance in the Fort where I once lived, and
<PB N="114" REF="67">
to divert my &s;elf with 'em. But unhappily I took out an old Gentleman with me, one day, to go to a &s;mall I&s;land hard by, where there were a great many Oy&s;ters; we had got a good many, but as we were coming back, it blew at &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a rate, that our Boat was turned over. The poor old Gentleman could not reach the Shore, meerly for want of &s;trength, and &s;o lo&s;t his Life within a hundred yards of the Land, but the old Chinee&s;e and I c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">me &s;afe to Shore, and the Boat was dri|ven quickly after us, &s;o that we took that up. In|&s;tead of paying the Chinee&s;e, I beat him &s;oundly for being the main cau&s;e of all this. And from that time I never &s;aw him more; without doubt he run away for fear the <HI>Fi&s;cael</HI> &s;hould call him to an account for the death of my Companion.</P>
<P>This was the fourth time, that God in his in|finite goodne&s;s delivered me out of that Element of Water, once in my own Country, once in <HI>Africa,</HI> once in the River of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and this time at <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>It was now time to go and wait upon the Sur|geon General, to know what was determined as to my affair. When I came there, I was &s;urpriz'd to find a Deputation to go and Board the Phoenix for <HI>Banda</HI> and <HI>Amboina,</HI> for be&s;ides that it cro&s;&s;ed my de&s;ign, which was to go to <HI>Japan;</HI> I knew that tho&s;e two Countries were the mo&s;t unhealth|ful of all India. However, after a little pau&s;e I re&s;olved to go thither or any where, rather than to &s;tay there. So taking my Orders with me, I went aboard the <HI>Enckhuy&s;en,</HI> and told by Brother Sur|geons how I was &s;erv'd, who in&s;tead of condoling with me, laught at me very heartily.</P>
<P>I was now to be gone in two days time; &s;o I made ha&s;te and provided my &s;elf with <HI>Arac, Tobacco,</HI> and Long-Pepper <HI>pre&s;erved;</HI> all which are found to be of greater u&s;e in tho&s;e unhealthy
<PB N="115" REF="67">
parts than in any other: And having made all other nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion, I went on board the Phoenix.</P>
<P>The next day we weighed Anchor, and &s;ailed from <HI>Batavia,</HI> the wind <HI>N. E.</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Sunday,</HI> and in three Weeks time we arrived before <HI>Banda,</HI> which is reckon'd to be three hun|dred Miles from <HI>Batavia.</HI> There fell nothing out worth any notice in our pa&s;&s;age thither, but that a poor Seaman was blown down by a &s;udden puff of Wind from the Fore-Ma&s;t upon the Anchor, which tore his very Guts out of his Belly.</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as we were come into the Road of <HI>Banda,</HI> our Ma&s;ter went a&s;hore; my Legs which had been &s;well'd for three or four days, were now &s;o &s;ore, that I could not &s;tir, el&s;e I
<PB N="117" REF="68">
would have gone with him with all my heart; but my Indi&s;po&s;ition augmenting, I was forced to be carried a&s;hore. There my Swelling increa&s;ed, all upward, and my Belly was now &s;well'd to the highe&s;t degree that could be, ready to break: And in this condition I continued the &s;pace of three weeks, (&s;o that I was left here very comfortle&s;s, for the Phoenix was obliged to be gone) and after that the Di&s;temper &s;eized me &s;o in all my Limbs, that I wholly lo&s;t the u&s;e of them; and during a quarter of a Year I could not bring my Finger to my Mouth; &s;o that truly I de&s;pair'd of ever re|covering the u&s;e of my Limbs, (altho' I was not &s;ick inwardly) and therefore I often prayed to God to take me to him&s;elf. I was carried every day to the Bagnio, where &s;everal other Patients with me were &s;et upon Seats, all in a ring, with Blankets wrapt round about us &s;o clo&s;e, that nothing but our Heads &s;tuck out; there was a great Fire of each &s;ide of us, which made the heat intolerable, and then we were held over the &s;teem of &s;ome medicinal Herbs, which were boyl'd for the purpo&s;e; into which infu&s;ion they threw thirty or forty red hot Cannon Bullets, which rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;teem, and made &s;uch a &s;mother, that not one in a hundred was able to bear it, but they were forced to be taken out, and carried away upon Quilts made for that purpo&s;e. I was taken out thus in the beginning, but when I came to be u&s;ed to it a little more, I bore it out bravely, and found it very helpful. So keeping to this for &s;ome weeks, I recover'd apace, and then they begun to anoint my Feet with <HI>Oleum Terrae,</HI> and pre&s;cribed me to drink frequently a &s;mall Gla&s;s of Bitter Brandy, or Arac infu&s;ed in Bitter Herbs; by which method, with the help of God, I perfectly recover'd.</P>

But I &s;hall decline giving any de&s;cripti|on of it, becau&s;e it hath been done already &s;uffi|ciently by others, e&s;pecially by <HI>Johan Hugen Van Lin&s;chooten.</HI> Only I wil give you a &s;hort account of the Noble Fruit which this I&s;land is famous for, <HI>viz.</HI> the Nutmeg and Mace, which the Inha|bitants, whether Dutch, or Freemen, or Slaves, are obliged to deliver yearly to the Governour, and is &s;ent afterwards to <HI>Holland,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and other places of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Tree on which the Nutmeg grows, is al|mo&s;t like the Pear-tree, but doth not &s;pread &s;o much, and its Leaf is &s;omewhat rounder. The Fruit is much like a Peach in bigne&s;s and looks, of an extraordinary fine ta&s;te, and delicate &s;mell, when it is ripe: On the out-&s;ide is a thick hard Shell, like the Bark of a Tree, over which the Flower grows. When the Nut begins to be ripe, it &s;wells &s;o much, that the fir&s;t Shell bur&s;ts open. The Flower is of fine Red, and very agreeable to look on, e&s;pecially when the Tree is pretty full of Fruit. Sometimes the Mace comes off of it &s;elf, and when it &s;ticks to the Fruit, they gather all to|gether; and in the drying of the Nutmeg, the Mace drys and falls off, and changes its lively Red into that brown Yellow, which we find it hath here in <HI>Europe.</HI> The whole Fruit is very proper to pre|&s;erve, and is an excellent Confite.</P>
<P>While I was at <HI>Banda,</HI> a couple of Fellows were executed for having killed their Mother; the death they were put to was very terrible; they were fa&s;ten'd upon a Wooden Cro&s;s, and their Limbs were broke with an Iron Bar, and there they were left to expire.</P>
<P>After I had &s;pent three Months here, in pretty good health, the Ship called the <HI>America</HI> came to <HI>Banda;</HI> &s;o that having now the opportunity of compleating my Voyage, which my &s;ickne&s;s pre|vented
<PB N="119" REF="69">
me to do with the Phoenix, I embraced it readily, and went in her for <HI>Amboina.</HI> I was glad to leave that unhealthy Country; and tho' I had, and &s;hall ever carry with me &s;evere tokens of the Plague of that Country, I was glad to come off &s;o well as I did. In four days time we came before <HI>Amboina,</HI> where our Ship was &s;traight loaden with <HI>Cloves.</HI> I went there on &s;hore to look about me; and while the Ship was lading, I had time to exa|mine how they grew, and what I could not be an Eye-witne&s;s of, I had from my old Friend the Serjeant, whom I made mention of before, from whom I got tho&s;e Bottles of Oyl of Cloves, which co&s;t me &s;o much care and trouble, and at the la&s;t I was forced to drop them into the Sea.</P>
<P>The Clove-Tree is much like the Laurel-Tree, the Blo&s;&s;om is White at fir&s;t, then it turns Green, and after that Red. While it is green it &s;mells &s;o fine and &s;weet, that nothing can be compared to it. The&s;e grow mighty clo&s;e to one another, and many of 'em together, all within the Blo&s;|&s;om; when they are ripe they gather 'em, and dry them; then they are of a brown Yellow. Tho&s;e Cloves which they do not gather, as not being ripe, hang on till the year following; and tho&s;e they call then <HI>Moeder Nagelen,</HI> i. e. <HI>Mother Cloves.</HI> Where the&s;e Trees grow, there grows no kind of Gra&s;s, or any green thing nigh; their nature being &s;uch, that they draw all the moi&s;ture about them to them&s;elves, and &s;o do the Cloves likewi&s;e, as I have often &s;een my &s;elf, that a Tub of Water be|ing &s;et in a Ware-hou&s;e that had &s;tore of Cloves laid up in it, after they were pickt and cleans'd, in three or four days time the Water would be all gone out of the Tub. The &s;mell of 'em is &s;o &s;trong, that &s;ome People have been &s;uffocated with it when they have been bu&s;ie with too great quan|tities of 'em, and in too clo&s;e a place.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="70">
Our Ship having taken in all her Lading, we left this place, and made directly for <HI>Batavia,</HI> and ar|rived there happily in a Fortnights time; where our Ship was immediately unladen, and all the Cloves put aboard the <HI>We&s;t-Friezland,</HI> in order to go for <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Here an Order was &s;ent me to change my Ship, and go in the <HI>Old Europe,</HI> the &s;ame Ship that brought me from the <HI>Cape</HI> to the <HI>Indies.</HI> I went with her to the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> which is a place fit for careening of Ships; where &s;he was to be fitted up, being very old. The I&s;land hath its name very ju&s;tly, <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>no re&s;t,</HI> by rea&s;on of the continual di&s;turbance, which the Sea cau&s;es to the Inhabitants, who are only Carpenters, Smiths, and other &s;uch Artificers for Shipping. For the I&s;land being very low, and the Sea Ebbing and Flowing every two hours, at very uncertain heights, gives the Inhabitants no re&s;t or &s;ecurity: And every new and full Moon, the Sea drives 'em up a va&s;t way; but &s;o un&s;ixt are its Bounds, that they are forced to be continually upon their Guard: Which be|&s;ides the great labour, and great quantity of work that lies upon their hands, makes it truly very re&s;tle&s;s for them.</P>
<P>There were two Ma&s;ter Surgeons be&s;ides me be|longing to the &s;ame Ship, and we had all our Pati|ents a&s;hore: The only pa&s;time we could have, was catching of Tortoi&s;es, of which there are va&s;t num|bers there. When it is fair, and the Sun &s;hines bright, they come out of the Water, and lie in the hot Sand. So when they were all very quiet and &s;ettled, we came upon them of a &s;udden with Sticks and Iron Bars, and turned them upon their Backs, as fa&s;t as we could, for then they cannot &s;tir. When we had done catching 'em &s;o, we took them out of their &s;hells, and put them in Pickle, and kept them in Barrels or Pots, with Salt and
<PB N="121" REF="70">
Vineger. This was our daily Food, and very good, but &s;ome of 'em are far better than other &s;ome. The bigge&s;t we caught was more than three Men could compa&s;s, and a loaded Wagon might &s;afely have gone over it without breaking it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are al&s;o a great many Sharks, which do much mi&s;chief; of which I gave you an in&s;tance before in the poor Chinee&s;e, that was diving for Iron, and was devoured by 'em. There is much fi&s;hing for 'em. And the manner of catch|ing them is, by baiting &s;everal very large &s;trong Hooks, with the whole Liver of &s;ome other Fi&s;h, which the Sharks will not fail to &s;wallow Hook and all, being extream greedy, and &s;o they are taken. The Tail is all that is eaten of this Fi&s;h, and that is not very palatable neither; but the whole is eaten &s;ometimes by Seamen, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, for want of other meat: But its Liver is very u&s;eful for many things in Surgery.</P>
<P>Our Ship being now thoroughly refitted, we re|turned to our old Anchoring Place at <HI>Batavia;</HI> where we found a Ship newly come from <HI>Holland,</HI> that had not yet ca&s;t all her Anchors. I took in all ha&s;t a Chinee&s;e <HI>Praw,</HI> and went on board of her to &s;ee if I could not meet with any old Ac|quaintance there, and to hear &s;ome News from our Country: And there I heard the fir&s;t account of <HI>Stransbourgh</HI> being taken by the French, which was a very great &s;urprize to us.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as our Ship had taken in all Nece&s;&s;a|ries here, &s;he was ordered to &s;ail for <HI>Ceylon,</HI> at which I was mighty joyful, and accordingly I recrui|ted my &s;elf with Provi&s;ions, and went on board: Then we left <HI>Batavia</HI> with the fir&s;t fair Wind, and in five Weeks time we happily arrived before <HI>Co|lumbo,</HI> which is the Chief City of the Dutch in <HI>Ceylon.</HI> It is one of the mo&s;t commodious Ports of any in the Indies, where Ships may lie &s;afe many
<PB N="122" REF="71">
years, and come in at will, with the Sea-wind, and run out when they plea&s;e, with a <HI>Land-wind.</HI> Yet there are a great many Rocks there, but they are only dangerous to Strangers; for which rea&s;on, when a Ship comes thither, that hath never been there before, &s;he is obliged to fire three Guns; whereas if he is acquainted with the place, he need fire but one. This is &s;traight an&s;wer'd by a Gun from a Watch-Tower, that is on one of the highe&s;t Rocks, about two miles di&s;tance from the City, where there is always a Pilot, and his Men ready, who as &s;oon as they &s;py a Ship coming, di&s;play a Flag in token that they mu&s;t come no further, and then they go and bring the Ship in.</P>
<P>At the Mouth of the Haven lies a Fort or Ca&s;tle, called <HI>'t Swart,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Black Fort.</HI> It was fir&s;t built by the Portugueze, but under a &s;pe|cious pretence of building a thing of a very dif|ferent nature. For when the King of <HI>Candy,</HI> who could at that time have prevented their work, &s;ent to know what they were about; they told him they were only building a Play-hou&s;e, and under that colour carried on their work, and pro|vided it with large pieces of Cannon, which they brought to Shore in great Hog&s;heads; and &s;o be|came able to maintain them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>I do not de&s;ign to enter upon a de&s;cription of this I&s;land, becau&s;e it hath been done very par|ticularly by others, and e&s;pecially by <HI>Chr. Schwit|zor,</HI> who&s;e Relation is now publi&s;hed with mine, to which I refer you.</P>
<P>While our Ship was lading with Cinnamon, and &s;everal other Rich Commodities, I went on Shore mo&s;t of the time; where I took my diet at a Freemans Hou&s;e, where I had it extream good, and well ordered, and for a very &s;mall price.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="71">
The great Commodity of this I&s;land is Cinna|mon, which is the Bark of a Tree, much of the bigne&s;s of an Olive Tree; the Leaves are much like the Laurel, but &s;omewhat &s;maller; the Flower it bears is white, and the Fruit is like the Black Olives of <HI>Portugal.</HI> The Tree hath two Barks, the Cinnamon is the inner one of them, which is peeled off the Tree, and cut in &s;quare pieces; then laid in the Sun to dry, which makes it rowl up together, as we &s;ee it in <HI>Europe,</HI> and changes its colour, which is at fir&s;t near upon A&s;h-colour, into what we find it of here.</P>
<P>When the Trees are peeled in this manner, they are let alone for three years, in which time they have regained their Coats as before. The Trees grow wild, without planting and cultivating, and make a &s;ort of Coppice of them&s;elves; and re|quire no other hand than that of Nature to make them beneficial to Man.</P>
<P>There is be&s;ides this, a &s;ort of Cinnamon, that grows in <HI>Malabar,</HI> and is called <HI>Canella de Matte,</HI> but it is a ba&s;tard kind, and nothing near &s;o good.</P>
<P>None of the Spices, neither the Cinnamon I have been &s;peaking of, nor the Cloves, Mace, Nut|megs, Saffron, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> may be carried away by any private Per&s;on upon pain of death: And it hath co&s;t &s;ome Men their Lives for attempting to bring them over; as I &s;aw an in&s;tance of one who had got a &s;mall parcel of <HI>Borrobone,</HI> in order to take with him home, and was executed for the fact. This <HI>Borrobone</HI> is a Root growing in great plenty in <HI>Iava,</HI> and is made u&s;e of in&s;tead of Saffron by all the Inhabitants; and it hath all the Vertues of the be&s;t Oriental Saffron; it is cut and dried, and looks like Ginger.</P>
<P>The other Great and Rich Commodity of this Place is Pearls, which they fi&s;h for after this man|ner, The Company hath &s;ome thou&s;ands of Di|vers
<PB N="124" REF="72">
for that purpo&s;e, which are divided into &s;o many Companies, and to each of them there is an Over&s;eer. The&s;e Men are all divided, &s;o many to each Boat, and &s;o they go to the Oy&s;ter. Banks; where &s;tripping them&s;elves, every one of them tie a &s;mall Basket round their middle: Then they bind a piece of a certain Root they have, that is very hollow, and of an Oyly &s;ub&s;tance before their Mouths, &s;o that it re&s;i&s;ts the water a good while, and gives them &s;ome time to breath. In this manner you &s;hall &s;ee 'em all go down with wonder|ful quickne&s;s to the very bottom; where they fill their little Baskets with Oy&s;ters, then come up again as nimbly as may be; and when they have a good quantity of 'em, they carry them to Shore, where they lay 'em out in the Sun; there they open of them&s;elves, and in them are found &s;ome|times many Pearls, &s;ometimes none at all.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Divers, more skilful than the re&s;t, will, without the help of tho&s;e Roots, keep under water almo&s;t as long as they that u&s;e them.</P>
<P>When their days work is over, they come to Shore all together in good order, delivering faith|fully all the Pearls they have got to the Officers that are appointed by the Company, which finds all the&s;e Men with Provi&s;ions, and other Nece&s;&s;a|ries, and allows &s;ome of them pretty good Sala|ries be&s;ides.</P>
<P>In the whole fi&s;hing Sea&s;on it cannot be but, there mu&s;t happen &s;everal accidents, and that ma|ny Men lo&s;e their Lives in the Sea among the Rocks; you hear almo&s;t daily of &s;ome &s;uch mi&s;|fortune, and every day gives &s;ubject of lamentati|on and complaint to &s;ome new made Widow or Orphan. Yet notwith&s;tanding all this, there is no want of Men, ready to take to &s;erve in this dange|rous employment, &s;ome being forced into it by the Dutch, and others by their nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="72">
The Oy&s;ters in which the Pearls are found, are fine, white and &s;mooth; I have known 'em find three hundred and odd of Pearls in one of 'em. When they have a mind to give them a fine co|lour, they take Rice, and beat it to du&s;t with Salt, and rub them with that, and it makes them as bright as Chri&s;tal, and &s;o they will continue.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of Oy&s;ter in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> which is called by the Inhabitants <HI>Changa,</HI> by us <HI>Mother of Pearl;</HI> this they poli&s;h very fine, and make fine drinking Cups of it. It is al&s;o of great u&s;e for many Ornaments, e&s;pecially that which comes out of <HI>China, Bengal, Ormus, Gammaron,</HI> &amp;c. as we &s;ee mo&s;t frequently on tho&s;e pieces of work, that come from thence into the&s;e parts of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e another manner of fi&s;hing, which is more tedious, and therefore le&s;s u&s;ed. Yet I have &s;een it practi&s;ed in a River that was thirty or forty Fathoms deep. Two Ships were laid a&s;ide of one another, at about eight or ten yards di&s;tance; and a Beam being laid acro&s;s them, whereon there is a large Pully fix'd; they hang a large Bell thereon, in which the Man &s;its, (upon a cro&s;s Seat fix'd within the Bell) and &s;o the Bell is let down; there is a little ringing Bell fixt upon the top of the Beam, and the Man hath a Cord with him fa&s;ten'd to that, and to his Body; as &s;oon as he finds the Air begins to fail him, he pulls that little Bell, which is a token to the re&s;t to pull him up; and when he hath clear'd that place, they move a little further, and fix there again till they have got all they can.</P>
<P>Having &s;pent my time a&s;hore, I went on board again, and then the other Ma&s;ter-Surgeon took his turn, and I went no more on &s;hore, but only once, when my Comrade &s;ent me word, that there was an Elephant of the Governor's was to &s;hew a great many Tricks, of which I have given you a relati|on before.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="73">
In a matter of five Weeks time, all our bu&s;ine&s;s being done in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> we all got aboard, and &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Batavia</HI> again, where under the Almighty's Protection we arrived &s;afe, after a kind Voyage of three Weeks. But we were no &s;ooner arrived, and ca&s;t our Anchors, but we fell into an extream dan|ger. Our Butler, according to cu&s;tom, and by the <HI>Skipper</HI>'s Order, went down to fetch &s;ome Arack for the Seamen, and as he was drawing it out of the Bunghole, with a &s;ort of &s;mall Pump, which they had for that purpo&s;e, either by a Snuff of the Candle, or by the Candle it &s;elf, the Arack took fire; and that &s;preading like Lightning, &s;et the whole on &s;ire; for the European Brandy doth not burn near &s;o violently as Arack doth. All our Men were immediately at work to put it out, but all in vain: It got a head after &s;o furious a manner, that it &s;et fire on the Ship it &s;elf, and it was not long e're that was all in a flame. We had then nothing more to do, but to look after our &s;elves, and to endea|vour to &s;ave our own lives; and it was a great mercy we could do that, for we could not &s;ave the lea&s;t parcel of our Goods, nor one of our Che&s;ts, much le&s;s any of the Company's Goods. This was a mighty lo&s;s to the Company, who had abun|dance of Cinnamon, and rich Cinnamon-Oyl on board, all which helpt its own de&s;truction, and in|crea&s;ed the Fire: For no &s;ooner had we left the Ship our &s;elves, but the fire took in the Powder-room, where there was &s;ome Tuns of Powder, which blew up the Ship and tore it all to pieces, and threw &s;ome of its Cannon above a quarter of a mile up into the Air. Thus, when we thought our &s;elves &s;ecure, and pa&s;t all danger, and plea&s;ed our &s;elves with the thoughts of our &s;ucce&s;s, we were all on a &s;udden mortified with this great ac|cident, and all our Joys de&s;troyed, with the utmo&s;t peril of all our Lives. But God be prai&s;ed, that
<PB N="127" REF="73">
no Man got any harm, but every one of 'em were &s;aved by means of a good number of Small Boats that were &s;ent to our Relief. The Butler, who had been the occa&s;ion of this, was &s;eized by the Judge Advocate, and for ought I know, was forced to &s;erve the Company all his life long for no|thing.</P>
<P>After this I had Orders &s;ent me to go upon the Fort, called the <HI>Hollandia,</HI> which is by the New Gate. There I had the care of the Sick and Wound|ed; and was &s;et over a Young Man, whom I had formerly known at <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and was here mar|ried to a Daughter of one of the <HI>Ka&s;tizen.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Ka&s;tizens</HI> are tho&s;e that had a Dutch Fa|ther, and an Indian Mother. When an European marries one of the&s;e <HI>Ka&s;tizees,</HI> and hath any Chil|dren by her, they are called <HI>Ma&s;tizees;</HI> and the&s;e may wear the &s;ame Garb that the Dutch u&s;e. Of this latter &s;ort, there are many thou&s;ands in and about <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>An Old Freeman, whom I u&s;ed to conver&s;e with frequently, and was very intimate with, undertook once in friend&s;hip to advi&s;e me to marry one of tho&s;e <HI>Ma&s;tizins;</HI> who, as he told me, was worth above forty thou&s;and Gilders. This proffer did not much di&s;plea&s;e me, but it was an Old Woman, he told me, and the Widow of an European Officer, who had &s;erved the Company. Hearing of her Age, made me not &s;o eager to &s;ee her as I was at fir&s;t, when he proffered to carry me to her. But the very &s;eeing of her di&s;gu&s;ted me &s;o much from Ma|trimony, and my Friend, that I never had a cha|ritable thought of him ever after. I thought at the fir&s;t of her, that it was an Ape of the larger &s;ize, that had been the wonder and pa&s;time of Mankind for &s;ome hundred years: And asking him, whether he thought me fit for nothing but the procreation of Baboons, I left him in a
<PB N="128" REF="74">
mighty pa&s;&s;ion, and would not &s;o much as &s;peak a word more about the matter.</P>
<P>When an European de&s;igns to marry any of tho&s;e People, He and the Woman mu&s;t appear before the Pre&s;ident of the Council, and bring their Con|tracts, (which are to be drawn up and &s;igned by a Publick Notary) to him, to have his con&s;ent to the con&s;ummation of the Marriage; likewi&s;e a Me|morial of the Goods of each of them mu&s;t be &s;hewed him, and regi&s;tred: And when they have obtained leave, the Wedding is generally kept about a fortnight after.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, that this baulk had turned my Stomach for &s;ome time again&s;t Matrimony, I was not very much inclined to it, becau&s;e a Man is obliged to &s;ettle, and &s;pend his life in <HI>India.</HI> For I had a de|&s;ign to be going further &s;till; and by the means of &s;ome Pre&s;ents, now and then, to obtain leave to go to <HI>Japan.</HI> For which purpo&s;e having made &s;ome clo&s;e applications, and u&s;ed the means I mentioned ju&s;t now, I after &s;ome time had orders to get me ready to go thither, on board the Ship called the <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which was to go in a fortnight to <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Japan.</HI> So I went and provided my &s;elf with all nece&s;&s;aries for that Voyage, it being no &s;mall one.</P>
<P>According to the Orders given, we &s;et &s;ail in the Name of God, on St. <HI>Steven</HI>'s day, with &s;o fair a <HI>South-wind,</HI> that by the next morning we were got three miles beyond the great I&s;land <HI>Java,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;mall I&s;land <HI>Carou&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>The next day we &s;aw the famous Coa&s;t of the I&s;land <HI>Borneo,</HI> and leaving that on the right and <HI>Temabo, Tumbolan</HI> and <HI>Ananibo</HI> on the left, we &s;teerd our Cour&s;e between them, till we came into the open Sea of <HI>Paragoa;</HI> where leaving <HI>China</HI> on the left of us, we &s;ailed directly upon <HI>For|mo&s;a.</HI> But e're we could reach it, we had very
<PB N="129" REF="74">
bad weather for &s;ome days, and were in extream danger; for be&s;ides that, the Sea it &s;elf is one of the mo&s;t dangerous by rea&s;on of the many Rocks there; we went thro' one of the dreadfulle&s;ts Storms that was almo&s;t ever known; in&s;omuch that we lo&s;t both Bolt-Sprit, and Sprit-&s;ail, and one other Sail. As we were drove to this extremity, our Ma&s;ter and Steer&s;man advi&s;ed together, whether they &s;hould not make what way they could to an I&s;land that lay on the right Hand, and within &s;ight of us, to &s;ee if by that means we might not &s;ave the Men and Cargo. So it was agreed upon, that we &s;hould make thi|ther with only our Main&s;ail, But the night com|ing upon us, before we could come near it, we lo&s;t all hopes of &s;afety; for the Tempe&s;t increa&s;ed with the darkne&s;s of the night, and we were mo&s;t of us in de&s;pair of our Lives, and for my part I never was le&s;s fond of Travelling, than at that time.</P>
<P>Yet my hope was, that as God had often pre&s;erved me from Eminent dangers before, &s;o he would not for&s;ake me then in this Condition; Thus we Con|tinued till near Morning, when our Seamen concei|ved &s;ome hopes of attaining to Land, and accordingly by break of day, we di&s;covered the I&s;land <HI>Manilba</HI> within two Miles of us, and by the help of the Light we made &s;hift to weather the Gulf of <HI>Ma|nilba,</HI> which as &s;oon as we were got into, we gave God Almighty thanks for his great Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Here we re&s;itted our Ship as well as we could ex|pect, and got a new <HI>Ma&s;t,</HI> and in Eight days time we &s;et Sail again with a fair wind Early in the morning, &s;o that by next day we left <HI>China</HI> on the left, and the next Morning were in &s;ight of <HI>For|mo&s;a,</HI> whither we came on &s;afe, and ca&s;t our An|chors before the Fort, called the <HI>Zealand.</HI></P>
<P>Our Ma&s;ter went a&s;hore, and did all his bu&s;ine&s;s in a fortnights time; during which time I was mo&s;t
<PB N="130" REF="75">
upon Land, but it being needle&s;s for me to give any Account of that place, which hath been &s;o Amply de&s;cribed by others; I will wave it, and pur&s;ue our Journey.</P>
<P>We &s;et Sail again with a fair wind, and &s;ail'd for Three days along the va&s;t Coa&s;t of <HI>China,</HI> which we had &s;till on the left of us, and when we came before <HI>Cucheu</HI> we ca&s;t our Anchors, and lay &s;till Two days there.</P>
<P>And then continued our Cour&s;e, &s;o that the next day we pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land of <HI>Chanquoi&s;h,</HI> and Steering between the I&s;land of <HI>Fuego,</HI> &amp;c. We in few days came before the City of <HI>Nangato,</HI> where we again returned God thanks, for having brought us thro' that dangerous Voyage. Notwith&s;tand|ing that our &s;hip was &s;o tattered, and that we had lo&s;t 14 of our Men; and had 20 &s;ick, among tho&s;e of us that were left.</P>
<P>We were forced to leave our Chaplain behind us at <HI>Batavia,</HI> for the Javians will not &s;uffer any Nation to bring any of their Teachers along with them into their Territorys. So that we were for|ced to make u&s;e of one of the grave&s;t of our Com|pany, who was A&s;&s;igned to read Prayers daily in the Ship, and a&s;&s;oon as we came to ca&s;t our An|chors, we had &s;trict Orders given by the Ma&s;ter to hide the Book very carefully, that had been u&s;ed in the Voyage; and to keep all other Religious Books clo&s;e out of &s;ight, le&s;t we &s;hould go in danger of our Lives, if they &s;hould di&s;cover any of 'em about us.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>VVE had &s;carcely dropt our Anchors before <HI>Nangato,</HI> but we had &s;ome Japonnee&s;es Boarding us with their <HI>Canows.</HI> They vi&s;ited our Ship from Top to Bottom, by Order of the Empe|ror; and according to their Cu&s;tom, &s;ecured all our Sails, and all our Powder and Bullets; di&s;|mounted our Cannon, and took off &s;ome of the Princi|pal Tackle of our Ship, and carried them on Shore with them. Thus they &s;erve all the Ships that come thither, and thus they had done to 3 or 4 Engli&s;h and French Ships, that lay there: But every bit they take away is faithfully returned, when they are ready to go off again.</P>
<P>When we had begun to unlade, a parcel of Japon|nee&s;es came to us to offer us &s;ome Women, and askt us, if we would not have &s;ome of 'em while
<PB N="132" REF="76">
we &s;tay'd there: But no body hearkned to their Propo&s;al but the Ma&s;ter, and the Book-keeper.</P>
<P>The goods were unladen by the Japonnee&s;es, of which a certain number is allotted to each Ship: So that our Men had little or nothing to do. The Ma&s;ter went on Shore, as &s;oon as the Ship was come nearer to the Town, and lay'd up there: But he came back every day an Hour at lea&s;t, or Two, before night: For all the while that we lay here, the Japonnee&s;es held a continual Watch aboard all the Ships that were in the Port. I can|not undertake to give you a large Account of <HI>Ja|pan,</HI> becau&s;e it would require a larger Volume then I intend; nor do I think it nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e &s;o many have done it before me; but what I ob&s;er|ved mo&s;t particularly among&s;t 'em, will, I hope, be &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the Readers Curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>When I came on Shore, the fir&s;t place I entred into, was a publick hou&s;e, where they drunk Tea, and that very plentifully; having re&s;ted there a while with my Companions, we went to take a view of the Town; where we &s;aw abundance of Joyners, and Japanners Shops, &s;et out with Wonderful vari|ety of rich and Exqui&s;ite work, as <HI>Scrutores Cabi|nets</HI> &amp;c. inlay'd with &s;ilver and gold, and mo&s;t admirably lackerd, all which made as fine a Show, as ever I &s;aw. Some of the&s;e pieces of Work were valued at &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Gilders. In that kind of Work they out-do all Indians whatever, and indeed in all manner of Ingenuity and Cunning, in&s;omuch that it was a Proverb among the Dutch, that <HI>tho' a Dutch Man was Cunning, be might go to School to a Japonee&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>They do not trouble them&s;elves with Linnen or Silk Manufactures; by rea&s;on that they are brought over to them in &s;uch abundance from other Coun|treys,
<PB N="133" REF="76">
that they have 'em as Cheap, as in the places where they are made.</P>
<P>Our Ship the <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> was laden with &s;uch kind of things, and took in Exchange, what <HI>Japan</HI> affords, as Copper Stafetiens, Silver, Gold <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Manner of Saluting us &s;eemed very &s;trange to me at fir&s;t; for whereas the Chinee&s;es, and other Ea&s;t-Indians u&s;ed to &s;hew their re&s;pect by clapping their hands together again&s;t their Brea&s;t or Fore-head, the&s;e People pull'd off their Shoes, and &s;et them|&s;elves down on the Ground, for they look upon it as the greate&s;t piece of Incivility to receive any Per|&s;on Standing.</P>
<P>Whereas other Nations think fair Hair, and white Teeth great Ornaments; the&s;e are of a quite diffe|rent Opinion, and think none agreable, but tho&s;e who have the Blacke&s;t Hair and Teeth: and they u&s;e all the Art they can to make them &s;o; their Notion in this being directly oppo&s;ite to ours, take|ing Black to be the Livery of Mirth and Plea&s;ant|ne&s;s, and white of Grief and Mourning. They have but very little Hair on their Heads, being always carefull to pluck it out by the Roots from their Youth. In &s;hort, all their Cu&s;toms, Language, Dre&s;s <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is as different as can be from all other People.</P>
<P>There is a certain Antipathy between them and the Chinee&s;es, they cannot bear with one another; when they go to War again&s;t the <HI>Tartars</HI> or the <HI>Chinee&s;es,</HI> they never give Ground, and will &s;ooner be Cut into a Thou&s;and pieces than Fly: and if Thou&s;ands, 10 or 100000 are Cut down, they are immediately Recruited: For their Law forbids them to yield to, or Flee from, any Enemy. Their Countrey is &s;o Populous, that one who hath not &s;een it cannot hardly believe it</P>
<P>The Sea Port of <HI>Nangato,</HI> was at our fir&s;t coming &s;o full of Birds, that it was almo&s;t covered with 'em,
<PB N="134" REF="77">
and all the Ships that lay there as it were Blockt up with them; they were very Tame, in&s;omuch that as our Boats went to and fro to Land, they would but ju&s;t give us way: the Rea&s;on of that va&s;t Quantity is, becau&s;e they never kill any of 'em to Eat, for their Law forbids them &s;trictly to Eat any thing that is Tame, as Oxen, Cows, Hens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But any thing that is Wild, they may and do Eat. So that the&s;e Fowls being harmle&s;s, as well as Tame, they do not &s;o much as di&s;turb them; which makes 'em Increa&s;e to that prodigious number. They are in Shape and Colour much like our wild Pigeons, and have the &s;ame feet with Ducks.</P>
<P>The night before I was re&s;olved to go on Board again, there fell out an unlucky Accident in our Ship. Some of the Seamen had &s;aved their Porti|ons of <HI>Arack</HI> for &s;ome days, de&s;igning to have a good Quantity together for Punch, and the place where they went to drink it being very dark, they got them&s;elves a Lamp, which they lighted, and Imprudently hung up upon one of their Hammocks; One of them being a little Intoxicated, and lazy, lay'd him&s;elf down in that Hammock, and the re&s;t of the Company pre&s;&s;ing him to drink in his Turn, he did now and then take his Cup, but at la&s;t his hand growing more and more un&s;teady, he &s;pilt part of his Cup over the Lamp; which by Misfor|tune hung over their Bowl. So that the whole taking Fire, and they not in a Capacity to look carefully about them, the Fire took hold of the Hammocks, and burnt &s;everal of them. But by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other Seamen it was happily &s;topt from doing any further Damage.</P>
<P>The men who had occa&s;ioned this were immedi|ately clapt up in Irons: And &s;ome days after they were brought to publick Puni&s;hment, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Sea: Which was to receive from every
<PB N="135" REF="77">
Per&s;on of the Ship 90 Blows on the Breech, with an Anchor Rope.</P>
<P>And had the Ma&s;ter not been very favourable, it would have fared much harder with them. How|ever, as mild as the puni&s;hment was, it made them in &s;uch a Condition, that they were forced to keep their Beds for &s;everal Weeks; and mo&s;t like to Die: Neither could any of 'em ea&s;e Nature, or make Water, for &s;everal days.</P>
<P>While we lay here, I was Invited on Board an Engli&s;h Merchant-Man, and there had great proffers made me if I would have gone along with them; the proffer was the more Advantagious, becau&s;e they had lo&s;t their Surgeon in the Voyage, and had but a Young raw Boy with them that could hardly &s;pread a Plai&s;ter. But I would by no means heark|en to their Propo&s;al, becau&s;e it was as much as my Life was worth, and what was yet more, I &s;hould have been Perjured if I had accepted of it, and for|&s;ook the Company.</P>
<P>In this Port dyed three of our Men, and a Car|penters Boy. Some Japonnee&s;es carried them out of the Harbour in a &s;mall Boat, into open Sea, where they threw 'em over: For they are &s;o far from &s;uffering any Forreigners to be Buried among them, that they will not permit them to be thrown &s;o much as in the Water that is near them. We had here &s;uch a Terrible Storm all on a &s;udden, that if our Ship had not been well provided with Anchors, and the Tempe&s;ts la&s;ted but a very little while; it had certainly been lo&s;t. For in that lit|tle while, of four Anchors that we had, we lo&s;t Two.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h Ship I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking of, foundered, at that time 7 of her Men were drowned, and the re&s;t very hardly e&s;caped. The next day they refitted our Ship again; during which time, I had an opportunity of going on Shore again for three or Four days.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="78">
In that time there happened to come &s;ome Jug|lers to <HI>Nangato,</HI> who &s;hewed the fine&s;t and the mo&s;t dexterous Tricks that I ever &s;aw, both of Le|gerdemain, and of Activity of Body; but of what they Showed of the latter an In&s;tance or two, will not be unacceptable. One of the&s;e Fellows had a Bam|boo Cane, of about 6 foot length tied to his Middle, and as he was Standing &s;till, another Fellow leap|ing on a &s;udden with his feet upon his Shoulders, climbed up to the Top of the Cane; and there lay'd him&s;elf out at length upon the Knob, which was on the top of the Cane, of about the bigne&s;s of a Goo&s;e's Egg, &s;tretching out his Arms and Leggs, and whiring round 3 or 4 times. The Man upon whom the Cane was tied fa&s;t, walking all the while to and fro, and never offering to touch the Cane with his hand.</P>
<P>After this there came a &s;econd who &s;tood upon his head, with his feet directly up in the Air, and then a third came and got up and &s;tood upon the Soles of his feet.</P>
<P>Then another &s;et him&s;elf firm upon his Leggs, and there came one of them and &s;tood upon his head, with his feet up in the Air.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, they took a Board all &s;tuck with &s;harp Nails about two &s;pans length; over which a Fellow rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his hands &s;o neatly, that his head did not touch one of the Spikes. The&s;e Tricks being &s;omewhat extraordinary, and far more &s;urpri&s;ing than what I have yet &s;een in Europe, I thought it might not be ami&s;s to give you an Ac|count of them, tho' I am &s;en&s;ible that &s;ome who think all Impo&s;&s;ible which they have not &s;een, will be apt to cen&s;ure it, rather than believe it.</P>
<P>This la&s;t time of my being a&s;hore, I chanced to come by one of their Religious A&s;&s;emblys, into which my Curio&s;ity led me to go, in hopes of &s;ee|ing
<PB N="137" REF="78">
&s;ome &s;trange Cu&s;tom: But there was nothing ve|ry peculiar. There only came in one of their Prie&s;ts, who &s;et him&s;elf down in the mid&s;t of the place, and a great many People being gathered about him, he made a kind of Sermon or Oration to them, which I hearkned to very diligently; but could not under|&s;tand a word of what he &s;aid. Nor would any one of that A&s;&s;embly give me any an&s;wer when I asked them what it was that he had been &s;aying to them, but all went off like Mutes; they do not at all care to enter into any di&s;cour&s;e with Chri&s;tians concerning Religi|on, which I often attempted to bring them up|on: And indeed it is not &s;afe for Chri&s;tians to talk to them on that Subject, as we had all &s;ufficiently been Informed 'ere we came to Land here. Yet I could not forbear to touch a little a upon't &s;ometimes, with one particular Acquaintance I had got there, who was a grave, &s;ober, under&s;tanding Man: And he would often expre&s;s very favourable Sentiments of the Chri&s;tian Religion, and did not &s;tick to tell me once (fetching a deep &s;igh) that he wi&s;hed he could be at liberty to Embrace it, but withal conjuring me not to di&s;cover him; becau&s;e it would co&s;t him his Life, if it was known that he had &s;uch a de&s;ire.</P>
<P>My time now grew &s;hort; and I made ha&s;te to buy what I wanted; but when I came to look about in their Shops and Ware-hou&s;es, I was &s;o Tempted with the &s;ight of their Fine-works that I bought a great deal more than I at fir&s;t de&s;igned to do. What I bought, tho' of the Fine&s;t-work, I had exceeding Cheap: Which was another Encouragement to me to lay out my Money. The&s;e Work-men are but very poor, as indeed all the Trades-men in the Country are. Some of 'em do not live better than Beggers, and a little Charity Tran&s;ports them into &s;uch humble Ac|knowledgments, that if at any time I gave any of 'em the value of Two-pence of our money, I could
<PB N="138" REF="79">
hardly keep them from falling upon their knees before me to thank me. There is no middle Rank of Men among them, of any value, even the Mer|chants being not lookt upon: But on the other &s;ide, their Gentry or Nobility are valued and Re&s;pected at a more than ordinary Rate: And in their gate and behaviour one may ob&s;erve &s;uch a Grandeur, or rather Haughtine&s;s, as is &s;carce to be &s;een any where el&s;e.</P>
<P>Our Ship being now full laden with Copper, Lack|er'd work, Jappan-money, and other Commoditys, the Japponee&s;es came again to us, fir&s;t to vi&s;it the Ship, and then re&s;tored us all our Cannon, Powder and Bullets, and our Sails; all which they brought us on Board again, and the next day, we &s;et &s;ail out of the Port, tho' it &s;nowed hard, and the Wind was &s;ome|what Rough.</P>
<P>The next Morning we &s;aw three Suns in the Hea|vens; but the Brightne&s;s of the two unu&s;ual Phoeno|menas the two &s;eeming Suns was not comparable to that of the real Sun; all three of them were &s;een within a large Rainbow.</P>
<P>The 2d. 3d. and 4th day we failed by the I&s;land <HI>Ximo,</HI> and coming to a &s;mall I&s;land of about 6 miles compa&s;s, we ca&s;t Anchor, to wait there for a Wind. Some our Men went on Shore, and brought back &s;ome Eggs with 'em, which Water-fowls lay u&s;ually about the Shore. They were as large as Gee&s;e eggs, and we found 'em extraordinary good.</P>
<P>The next day we went off with a good Wind; 2 or 3 days after, we were all of us Surprized to &s;ee &s;omething Floating, and hundreds of Fowl upon it; but coming nearer to it, we found it was a va&s;t big Fi&s;h, cover'd with tho&s;e Birds.</P>
<P>We found here but 18 or 20 fathoms Water; &s;o that we were dayly and continually forced to u&s;e the Plummet: Till a fre&s;h Storm came upon us which obliged us with all &s;peed to hand all our &s;ails.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="79">
The Tempe&s;t was &s;o furious for a time, that we thought no otherwi&s;e but we &s;hould have been &s;wal|lowed up: But God Almighty, who&s;e Compa&s;&s;ions never fail towards them that call upon him faithful|ly, was plea&s;ed to deliver us out of our di&s;tre&s;s, by &s;tilling the Winds, and after &s;ome time we came to a &s;mall low &s;andy I&s;land, called <HI>Kruys I&s;land,</HI> where we dropt 2 of our Anchors.</P>
<P>In this &s;tre&s;s of Weather we lo&s;t one Man, who was To&s;&s;ed off the Maintop Ma&s;t into the Sea. The Billows carried him quite out of our &s;ight, el&s;e we had been obliged by our Sea Articles to have put out the long Boat and to have gone after him, tho' we run the risk of loo&s;ing all the Men of the Ship. But be|ing we could not &s;ee him, we were not obliged to &s;eek after him; and it was more prudent to give him over for lo&s;t, than to venture 7 or 8 Men more when there was no Pro&s;pect of doing any good.</P>
<P>It Snowed very hard: &s;o that we lay &s;till here 2 days, and on the 3d. day, we &s;et &s;ail directing our Cour&s;e towards <HI>Formo&s;a.</HI> In our way thither we came by a large Rock almo&s;t cover'd o're with Fowl, we went up to it with our long Boat, and caught above a hundred of 'em: if we would have &s;tayed a while, we might have caught thou&s;ands, for they hardly fled away from us: But mo&s;t of 'em crept into their ne&s;ts, which were nothing, but the natural Cavitys of the Rock, without any &s;traw or any kind of Lining in them; they being &s;o ea&s;y to come at, made us conclude, that they had hardly ever been di&s;turbed by any Man.</P>
<P>At Noon our Steers-man took the Suns altitude, by which we found that we were within 40 Leagues of the I&s;land <HI>Formo&s;a,</HI> whither we were Steering. It was as fine Weather, as we could wi&s;h; but the Wind being again&s;t us, we were forced to clap upon the Wind to make the be&s;t of it, and get a little forward,
<PB N="140" REF="80">
till we came to have the Wind upon the beam, which in 3 days time brought us before the Road of <HI>Zea|land.</HI> There we put &s;ome Rice a&s;hore, and &s;tay|ed but a day and a half, and at night we put out of the Bay, Firing 3 Guns to take our leave. While our Gunner was doing this, he had left a mea&s;ure of Powder in the Boys hands who &s;tood behind him, and a Seaman coming by with a Pipe of Tabacco in his Mouth, going to peep into the Powder ca&s;e, let fall &s;ome of his Tobacco among&s;t it, which burnt him dreadfully, and threw the Boy backwards to the ground. It was well this did not happen in a greater parcel, and that there was no more harm done. But for this the Seaman was taken, and was &s;everely pu&s;s'd: That is done by laying 'em flat on their Belly, and &s;tricking them with a Rope acro&s;s the Breech.</P>
<P>The next day we Steer'd between two high Rocks, that were about half a League a&s;under: The Wind from that time continued fair for us during the &s;pace of 8 days, in which we pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land <HI>Manilha,</HI> then we came into a Wind, which was very trouble|&s;ome to us; for it filled the Air with na&s;ty &s;tuff as thick as Snow, this Wind came over &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands that lay 2 Miles on the South of us, which are called the <HI>Stof Elyanden.</HI> When the Wind is pretty high, and &s;its in that corner, if a Ship goes too near them, it is almo&s;t enough to Smother Men. But God be thanked we came &s;afe thro' it, and with a favourable Wind came into the Sea of <HI>Para|gua;</HI> we kept on our Cour&s;e to <HI>Borneo,</HI> and from thence to Great <HI>Java,</HI> whence we quickly reach'd <HI>Batavia;</HI> which happily compleated our Voyage in 5 Months.</P>
<P>Being Arrived, our Ship was unladen: Our &s;ick Men carried to the Ho&s;pital, and I at the &s;ame time went on Shore, and took all my Medicaments with
<PB N="141" REF="80">
me, but we had not been here above a fortnight, but an opportunity offerd it &s;elf to me, either to go along with a &s;mall Fleet to the Straight of <HI>Sunda,</HI> or el&s;e with another which was to crui&s;e between <HI>Malacca</HI> and <HI>Sumatra.</HI> I had my choice, and having declared my de&s;ire rather to go with the latter, I re|ceived my Commi&s;&s;ion. The rea&s;on why the&s;e two &s;mall Squadrons were &s;ent thither was, becau&s;e we were informed, that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being di&s;gui&s;ed at the di&s;turbance we had given them in <HI>Bantam,</HI> were coming out again&s;t us.</P>
<P>After we had been &s;ome Weeks a Crui&s;ing there, now toward <HI>Sumatra,</HI> then towards <HI>Mallaca,</HI> &s;ome|time to the I&s;land <HI>St. Maurice</HI> and <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> with|out Meeting with any either French or Engli&s;h, Captain <HI>Vander Bors,</HI> who was our <HI>Commadore</HI> or <HI>Ad|miral,</HI> re&s;olved to go with the Fleet to <HI>Achem,</HI> and to lye &s;till there, only he orderd that one Ship &s;hould be Crui&s;ing about, and bring Intelligence, and the whole Squadron which con&s;i&s;ted of 11 Ships &s;hould take it by turns.</P>
<P>While we lay here we had a mo&s;t dreadful Storm for the &s;pace of 6 whole days. The <HI>Sciam</HI> was ca&s;t away, Men and all, except a few of 'em. The <HI>Zealand</HI> having lo&s;t all her Anchors, was drove upon a Shelf, where &s;he &s;tuck. We went in ha&s;te to help her Men, and we did &s;ave &s;ome of 'em: But at la&s;t the two long Boats which we had &s;ent to their Relief being To&s;&s;ed violently again&s;t each other, Split in pieces, and all the Men in them were drowned, which were about 130.</P>
<P>As for our Ship, we were forced to Swaddle it with a four double Cable Rope, le&s;t it &s;hould have Split, by the violence of the Waves, and to keep con&s;tantly Pumping, &s;ix and &s;ix at a time, changing Men every quarter of an hour. And whereas one Man u&s;ed to &s;uffice at the helm, we were forced to
<PB N="142" REF="81">
have 10 to keep our Anchors from twi&s;ting altoge|gether and breaking. The wor&s;t of this was, that we were not far from Land, and we were ju&s;t of the Windward of'm: For we had been much &s;afer if we had been in open Sea. But that is &s;afe enough every where which God takes into his keeping, and it plea&s;ed him at the end of 6 days to &s;end us a fine Calm again, wherefore we went immediately to Pray|ers, and gave God thanks that he had thus deliverd us.</P>
<P>The next thing we did was to give the Men &s;ome Refre&s;hment, one chief part of which is always a good portion of <HI>Arack,</HI> and that being done we &s;ent word to <HI>Batavia,</HI> what a poor condition we were in, to which we had for an&s;wer, that we might come away for <HI>Java</HI> again: For that two Ships were lately come thither from <HI>Holland,</HI> which had brought information, that there was no report there of any likely-hood of War, and that we needed not to fear it in tho&s;e Parts: But only that <HI>England</HI> required &s;ome Millions of Money from <HI>Holland,</HI> for the dam|age the Engli&s;h had &s;u&s;tained by their means in <HI>Ban|tam;</HI> and that in ca&s;e the Dutch did not come to a Compo&s;ition, a War would mo&s;t certainly follow.</P>
<P>While we lay &s;till before <HI>Achem,</HI> I went often to Shore to refre&s;h my &s;elf with the excellent Fruits of that Country. The Religion, Manners Cu&s;toms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of that People are much the &s;ame with the <HI>Javians.</HI></P>
<P>In a Village not far from thence, where none but Fi&s;her-men live, I &s;aw Men that had one of their Leggs as big as mo&s;t Mens middles; when they u&s;ed to hold them up, it would Shade their whole Body from the Sun, and yet would the&s;e Men run as fa&s;t as Hor&s;es. I &s;ometimes layd my hand on tho&s;e Leggs of theirs, and they felt ju&s;t like a Spunge.</P>
<P>By that Village runs a very fair and plea&s;ant Ri|ver, which empties it &s;elf into the Sea, near the place where we lay at Anchor, along the &s;ides of
<PB N="143" REF="81">
which are a great many &s;trange Tree, which bear a Fruit they call Wild <HI>Ananas</HI> 3 times a year, when the Fruit is ripe it is extream plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Our Fleet, which con&s;i&s;ted now of no more than 9 Ships, &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Batavia,</HI> where we Arrived in a fortnight: And found the other Fleet come three days before us.

<P>Before it went off I went to Shore to take my leave of my old Acquaintance; and there met with one that was lately come out of Europe, a Native of <HI>Ulm,</HI> a place I was well acquainted with; and it being a day which was kept there as a Fe&s;ti|val, we kept it here al&s;o among&s;t our &s;elves, and diverted our &s;elves very well: Among other news he brought over with him, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was, that the <HI>Turks</HI> were beaten from before <HI>Vi|enna;</HI> which did not a little contribute to our Joy and Satisfaction.</P>

<P>IN two days time we &s;et Sail with a fair Wind: And the &s;ame day before Sun-&s;et we pa&s;&s;ed by the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> then came between the I&s;land <HI>Toppers-hoedie,</HI> and <HI>Bantam</HI> along Great <HI>Java</HI> into open Sea: And in 18 days time we reached the I&s;land <HI>Bali,</HI> and ca&s;t our Anchors before the Capital Town of the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>In our former Voyage to <HI>Banda</HI> and <HI>Amboina,</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by this place and came within 8 Miles of it; But the Wind being then &s;o fair for us, we would not touch here, but made the be&s;t of our way for|ward: Otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have called here of Cour&s;e, as mo&s;t Ships do, to take in fre&s;h Water, and other Refre&s;hments.</P>
<P>Here we unladed our Ship, and exchanged the Commodities for tho&s;e of the Countrey: Which were chiefly, Silk and Cotton wrought, mo&s;t of the Peo|People
<PB N="145" REF="82">
here being employed in Spinning and Wea|ving.</P>
<P>They are a very Strong &s;ort of People, &s;omewhat Blacker than the generality of other Indians are. They u&s;e no other Weapon when they fight but Ar|rows, which they carry always about them in a kind of quiver. The&s;e Arrows are &s;o contrived, that when the Man who is Wounded with 'em goes to draw them out, they break; be&s;ides that, they are &s;o Artificially Poy&s;on'd, that it is pre&s;ent death without any Remedy.</P>
<P>They permit them&s;elves to be &s;old, to any Nati|on over all the Indies, for Slaves; while I was there I bought a young Girl of a Merchant, for 18 Rix|dollers, and took her with me to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where I could make her earn me two Shillings or 18 Pence a day.</P>
<P>They are exceeding Bruti&s;h People, and the Simple&s;t of Heathens. Their God is what ever they fir&s;t ca&s;t their Eye on in the Morning, &s;o that it is &s;till variable, &s;ometimes a Cow, &s;ometimes a Tree, &s;ometimes a Dog, or a Bird, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This they keep in veneration for all that day, and pray to it with great earne&s;tne&s;s upon all emergencies.</P>
<P>They know nothing of Marrying among&s;t 'em. But as it is among Brutes, Men and Women are in common to each other, which makes the Country very Populous. Yet each man hath always &s;ome one whom he looks upon as a Principal Con&s;ort, and by the Cu&s;tom of the Country &s;he is obliged to &s;uch a &s;evere and Rigorous Ceremony upon the death of her Mate, as would very ill go down with tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion of more faithfulne&s;s and a more Honourable ob&s;ervance of their more &s;o|lemn Engagements: And I have &s;een them acquit them&s;elves of it with the greate&s;t Re&s;olution ima|ginable; I mean the Burning them&s;elves, when their reputed Husbands Corps is committed to the Flames.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="83">
The manner of it is thus. When the Man is dead, they &s;ow him up in a Cotton cloath, and car|ry him up to the Top of the Hou&s;e, where they keep him four or five days; during which time the Woman hath time to prepare her &s;elf, that is, to take her leave of her friends; and all the while &s;ome old Women who are hired for that purpo&s;e, are &s;itting at the door, crying and howling. Then they dig a great hole near the River &s;ide, which they fill with Wood, and having laid the Corps up|on it, they &s;et fire to the Wood. The Woman all this while having taken her farewel of all her Rela|tions, and having got a whole bundle of pre&s;ents and recommendations to their friends in the other World, &s;he binds up all her tokens together in a Cotton Cloath, and when the Fire is throughly lighted, &s;he throws her &s;elf therein.</P>
<P>The&s;e tokens are different according to the Con|dition, Inclination, or degree of Relation of the Per&s;on they &s;end to; as one Man &s;hall &s;end his Wife Money, the other Flowers, the other &s;ome other &s;mall pre&s;ent, all which &s;he promi&s;es to deliver faithfully. There &s;tands round the Fire &s;everal Per|&s;ons with their In&s;truments of Copper and other Metals, on which they make &s;uch a horrid noi&s;e, that there is no hearing of the Womans Shreeks, be|&s;ides there are Men ready with Ve&s;&s;els of Oyl to pour into the Fire to make it Burn more vehement|ly, that &s;he may the &s;ooner be out of her pain.</P>
<P>When they are thus con&s;umed to a&s;hes, they are taken up very clean and thrown into the River with another con&s;ort of howling and crying. I know there hath been &s;everal Accounts of this given by others after a different Manner, but what I have here given is as I have been an eye witne&s;s of it my &s;elf.</P>
<P>Here grows &s;ome of the &s;ine&s;t Fruits in the World, and in great plenty, &s;o that I eat my fill of 'em. The&s;e Fruits are a Refre&s;hment of no &s;mall value to
<PB N="147" REF="83">
an European, and it makes him have a much great|er e&s;teem for tho&s;e remote and Barbarous I&s;les, and it is very often the only thing for which one would value them; it is as ob&s;ervable, that the more Bar|barous the Country is, the more it excels in choice and delicate Fruits, as this place may well &s;erve for an example, and all the I&s;les thereabouts, which are Inhabited by the mo&s;t Bruti&s;h &s;ort of Men. And &s;ome of 'em by Men who devour one another, and make a fea&s;t of their Victory; as at <HI>Su&s;u,</HI> which lyes here hard by, and likewi&s;e in the Country of the <HI>Hot|tentots</HI> near the Cape of <HI>Good Hope.</HI> I have often wi&s;ht for &s;ome of them &s;ince I parted with them, and that they had agreed more with our Climate, &s;o that we could have them in Europe.</P>
<P>Our bu&s;ine&s;s being done, we left <HI>Bali;</HI> And quick|ly gained the Co&s;t of Great <HI>Java,</HI> from which <HI>Ba|li</HI> lyes but eight Leagues di&s;tance; and in eight days Sail we arrived at <HI>Balavia</HI> again. We had all the way the &s;ight of the I&s;land we left, and &s;ome|times could &s;ee over it in a very clear day, it not being above &s;ixteen Miles in compa&s;s.</P>
<P>When we came to Shore I was very kindly rece|ved, and placed into the Ho&s;pital at <HI>Batavia;</HI> there be|ing ju&s;t then a vacancy by the death of the chief Surgeon of that place, the Council was plea&s;ed to choo&s;e me in his &s;tead, and to give me the care of it. Here I had five Ma&s;ters Surgeons under me, and my Station was every way much more agreable than hi|therto it had been; but that which plea&s;ed me the be&s;t, was that I had both time, and opportunity to &s;erve God; and tho' it was only the Reformed Re|ligion that was exerci&s;ed there, yet I took a great deal of Satisfaction in going to &s;erve God with them, when their A&s;&s;emblys met; which was three times a Week. But I could rather have wi&s;hed there had been a Church of my own per&s;wa&s;ion (which is the &s;ame that <HI>Luther</HI> maintaind and profe&s;s'd) for
<PB N="148" REF="84">
then I believe I &s;hould never have troubled my &s;elf to have come back into <HI>Holland</HI> again, and I dare &s;ay that thou&s;ands more would willingly continue there, rather than undertake &s;uch dangerous Voyages to come back, if they could but have the free exer|ci&s;e of their Religion, as they have in <HI>Holland,</HI> where all Religions are tolerated; and it was ever a wonder to me, that the &s;ame liberty was not granted in <HI>Batavia,</HI> which is as wi&s;ely and politi|cally govern'd as any City in the World, and keeps as good an order in all things, notwith&s;tanding the great variety of its Inhabitants; having within it, be&s;ides the Natives of the &s;everal parts of the Indies, va&s;t numbers of <HI>Turks, Per&s;ians, Tartars, Chinee&s;es, Siamers, Moors, Japonee&s;es, Armenians, Arabi|ans, &amp;c.</HI> Yet is there no other Religion allowed, but that of the Reformed, and at their A&s;&s;emblys are all the Soldiers obliged to be pre&s;ent, of what per&s;wa&s;ion &s;oever they be, and forced to be there every <HI>Sunday</HI> by Turns, under the Eye of an Officer, and then they put their Shoes on, whereas they wear 'em but-rarely otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>There are be&s;ides the Church in the Ca&s;tle two other Churches, where they Preach in the <HI>Portu|gueeze</HI> and the <HI>Maley&s;h</HI> Languages the fir&s;t for the conveniency of the Burghers, the other of the mixt Nations, who generally &s;peak that Language.</P>
<P>Yet for all this liberty of Religion is not given, there are many hundreds, who when their time is ex|pired, bind them&s;elves a fre&s;h rather than venture the danger of going home again, tho' they lay their Re|ligion a&s;ide for ever for't. The frequent news of of Ships being ca&s;t away, and loo&s;ing one half of the Fleets, and &s;ometimes the whole ones, increa|&s;es their fears daily. While I was at <HI>Batavia</HI> my &s;elf, I &s;ent a Letter to my Relations, by one who intended to pa&s;s thro' <HI>Ulm,</HI> where they lived: And
<PB N="149" REF="84">
of this Fleet he went in, half was lo&s;t by the way, tho' he got &s;afe home, and to my great &s;urprize brought me an an&s;wer to it him&s;elf, about two years after that: Ju&s;t as I was preparing to come into <HI>Holland</HI> my &s;elf, he told me he was come over again to end his days there, for he found that the Air of his Native Country would no more agree with him.</P>
<P>While I was thus &s;ettled here, I got very con|&s;iderable practice among the Free-men, be&s;ides my fixt employment; and e&s;pecially among the Chinee|&s;es, whom I found by much the mo&s;t generous &s;ort of People and be&s;t to deal with. It was common for them to give me three or four Rixdollars for letting of 'em Blood, and forty or fifty Gilders for curing the lea&s;t Wound. But of all the Patients I ever had, I cannot but mention one, who for the od|ne&s;s of the Puni&s;hment which was inflicted on his Adver&s;ary, is well worth the Relating.</P>
<P>I was once in a Chinee&s;e's hou&s;e drinking of <HI>Tea,</HI> which is drunk in great quantitys there in <HI>Tea-hou|&s;es,</HI> very good and very Cheap. On a &s;udden two Chinee&s;es fell to high words, till at la&s;t one of'em took a pot full of Boyling hot Water, and threw it all upon the other, and all Scalded his Face, and &s;ome other parts. I took the Man home, and cu|red him in a few days, for which he gave me thirty Rixdollars ready Money and did me all the kind &s;ervices he could, often inviting me to his hou&s;e, and treating me very civilly. The other who had u&s;ed him thus ba&s;ely, was Condemned to have twelve of the longe&s;t Hairs of his Beard pull'd out, or el&s;e to pay thirty Golden <HI>Cubanz</HI> which is in value 300 Rixdollars (each <HI>Cubanz,</HI> being worth 10 Rixdollars, and the Golden Coyn of the Great <HI>Mogul's)</HI> but this Chinee&s;e being a Man of Sub&s;tance, cho&s;e rather to pay the Money than to part with &s;o many precious hairs out of his Beard, and they are all of them &s;o fond

of that Ornament, that it would have been as Rea|&s;onable to have ask him for twelve of his Teeth. Be&s;ides this, he was obliged to defray all the charges my Patient had been at, and to &s;tand to all damages.</P>
<P>There was all this while a fine Ship preparing for a Voyage to <HI>Surat,</HI> and I having a great de&s;ire to go that Voyage, becau&s;e it is lookt upon as very &s;afe, and hardly ever attended with bad Accidents, I ordered my affairs &s;o as to get leave to go: Upon which I &s;ent my things on Board the <HI>Gelderland,</HI> for that was the name of the new Ship which I was to go in.</P>
<P>On Ea&s;terday in the Morning, all things being ready, we &s;et Sail by break of day, and took our farewell with three Guns, but we reacht no further by night than the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> and for want of a Wind, were forced to lye &s;till there four days. At la&s;t we weighed our Anchors, having a &s;mall gale of Wind, which carried us pa&s;t the I&s;le <HI>Sumatra:</HI> And as we came by the I&s;land <HI>Engano,</HI> it cea&s;ed and left us without a breath of Wind. Thus we left the Ship to run a drift, and our Men were all idle for three or four days, during which time we had <HI>Engano</HI> &s;till in &s;ight of us, for we moved but very &s;lowly.</P>
<P>In this while many of our Men took notice that one of our Souldiers (for we had fourteen of them a Board be&s;ides Seamen) a Venetian Named <HI>Nico|lao,</HI> u&s;ed to be frequently with two Boys that be|long'd to the Ship, and tho&s;e three would meet in private ever and anon. The Boat-Swain took a particular notice of 'em, and watcht 'em narrowly; at la&s;t he di&s;coverd the end of their Meeting, and Surprized them in the Act of Sodomy; Upon which he went and informed the Ma&s;ter of what had pa&s;&s;ed. Immediately after the Venetian, and both the Boys, one of about eighteen, the other about twelve year of age, were &s;eized, and layd up in Chains,
<PB N="151" REF="86">
and upon Examination they all confe&s;s'd that they had been guilty of that abominable Sin ever &s;ince their departure from <HI>Batavia.</HI> I and the other Ma&s;ter Surgeon were then of the Council, and by them, we were orderd to vi&s;it them, and we found it but too true, upon which the Sentence was pronounced again&s;t all three of 'em, <HI>viz.</HI> that they &s;hould be ca&s;t into the Sea, and accordingly early the next Morning after Prayers, the Venetian was brought forth: And one of the Boys tied to his right &s;ide, and the other to his left, and in that Manner thrown in altogether, and were never more &s;een by us.</P>
<P>The Boys were very penitent, and much affected with their guilt, and Prayed with the Chaplain very heartily, and &s;hed Tears in abundance: So that there were but few of us, that could refrain weep|ing at the &s;ight of 'em. But the Venetian was not at all concerned; and when he &s;tood upon the Plank, ready to be thrown off, he begged for nothing but a draught of <HI>Arack.</HI> The Ma&s;ter told him, he &s;hould have drink enough in an In&s;tant, and de&s;ired him to con&s;ider of his latter end, and to provide for futuri|ty, but all Remon&s;trances were in vain to the la&s;t, and &s;o he was thrown over.</P>
<P>There was another, who was &s;u&s;pected of the &s;ame crime; and upon Examination he confe&s;s'd he had intended it, but never was guilty of the act, him the Council order'd to remain in Chains, and to be &s;et on Shore on the next Wild I&s;land we &s;hould come at, which was <HI>Ouro,</HI> which was accordingly done; when we Landed him there, we left him &s;ome Water, Bisket and Tobacco to &s;erve him &s;ome days, and a Gun; he begged heartily that we would ra|ther take away his life: But it was not granted.</P>
<P>So we went forward with &s;o fair a gale of Wind, that we lo&s;t &s;ight of that I&s;land before night. We pa&s;&s;ed on between <HI>Ceylon,</HI> which we left on the right, and the <HI>Maldivy</HI> I&s;lands which lay on the
<PB N="152" REF="87">
left, and Steering round the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;nagar,</HI> we came with good &s;peed to <HI>Surat</HI> after five Weeks &s;ail, where we ca&s;t Anchor.</P>
<P>Our Ship was immediately unladen to make room for other goods: And our Merchants went on Shore to their apartment, which is always ready for 'em here, as it is in all tho&s;e places, where they have Factories: And there they have all nece&s;&s;ary Ware|hou&s;es; Apartments, Servants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> fit to receive them when ever they come.</P>
<P><HI>Surat</HI> lyes about 800 Leagues from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and belongs to the Emperour of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> otherwi&s;e cal|led the <HI>Great</HI> Mogul, who calls him&s;elf Lord of all the Indies.</P>
<P>It is remarkable and &s;trange to ob&s;erve how the Sea&s;ons of the Year are here divided, their Winter on|ly &s;hows it &s;elf by its con&s;tant Rains, for half a year in one part of the Country; during which time it Rains almo&s;t daily more or le&s;s; and while this &s;ort of Winter la&s;ts in one part, it is Summer and fair in the other parts of the Countrey, &s;o that they have it by turns. The days and nights are always near equal, of twelve hours each, what difference there is, is not perceptible.</P>
<P>All this while our Ship was taking her lading in apace, but it was not great, mo&s;t of it was <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Money; when &s;he had all in, we &s;et Sail without delay with the fir&s;t fair Wind, and in fourteen days time we pa&s;&s;ed again by the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar</HI> now on the left. Thence we &s;ail'd about the Cape of <HI>Gomori,</HI> which lyes extended to the South, and after that, we came to <HI>Punto de Galle,</HI> which is very com|modious for all the Ships that pa&s;s that way to take in any Refre&s;hments. There we took in fre&s;h Water and other nece&s;&s;arys. We found there an Engli&s;h Ship, called the <HI>Sina,</HI> come from <HI>Bengal,</HI> and bound for <HI>Cameron</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>We laid four days here, before <HI>Punto de Galle:</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="87">
And then the Wind blowing fair for us, we run out of the Haven, and pa&s;&s;ed the next day by the <HI>Maldivy</HI> I&s;lands, of which it is computed that they are above a thou&s;and in number, and in &s;even days &s;ail we came to the I&s;land <HI>Ouro,</HI> where we had left the Souldier. We ca&s;t Anchor there, and &s;ent out the long Boat with &s;ome Men to look after him, but they could not hear or &s;ee ought of him: So we continued our Cour&s;e towards Great <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>While we were in open Sea about 100 Leagues off <HI>Malacca,</HI> we had during three Weeks time &s;uch a Calm, that we thought we &s;hould never have had a breath of Wind more. So that in all that time we did not get a League forwards, only the Sea Wind moved us a little to and fro, but did us no good. For, tho' it may &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e that are Ignorant of it, it oftentimes happens that the Main Sea, e&s;pecially that part of it, where no Bot|tom is to be found, is in a very great agitation, tho' there be no Wind at all to be perceived: And I my &s;elf have often &s;een in the &s;tille&s;t VVeather, the VVaves heap'd up on Hills, and &s;o furiou&s;ly high, that no Storm can rai&s;e them higher, and of|ten times there is as great Danger, and as many Ships are there ca&s;t away; e&s;pecially tho&s;e that are not well laden.</P>
<P>During this Calm, we &s;uffer'd more than ever we could have done in the mo&s;t Terrible Tempe&s;t, for we were under the Line, and the exce&s;&s;ive heat cau|&s;ed &s;everal to fall Sick, and what was wor&s;e &s;till was, that we had made no great provi&s;ion of Water by rea&s;on it was lookt upon to be but a &s;hort Voy|age; So that with heat and thir&s;t, we were all in danger of being &s;uffocated. Our Water was now &s;o far &s;pent, that a draught of it cold not be had un|der a couple of Rixdollars. At lea&s;t it came to that pa&s;s, that there was a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting two Centinells to guard the Water-Cask; out of which
<PB N="154" REF="88">
they u&s;ed to di&s;tribute every man his portion, and to &s;et four Locks upon it. And when the Portions were given out in the Morning, it was not above one quarter of the mea&s;ure that it u&s;ed to be.</P>
<P>In this mi&s;erable Condition I have been forced to to give two dozen of my Silver Buttons off my Wa&s;t|coat, for one draught of Water, and to gnaw bits of Wood, hoping I might &s;uck &s;ome moi&s;ture out of it. In &s;hort, it put us all upon trying all the ways we could imagine to allay our exce&s;&s;ive drought; we had now but &s;ix Barrels of Water left, and we &s;aw no pro&s;pect of Relief, &s;o that many of us often wi&s;h'd that our Ship would &s;ink down right with us, we neglected not to call upon God, and to &s;end up our Prayers to him con&s;tantly thrice a day, that he would have Compa&s;&s;ion on us; and as this was more becoming Chri&s;tians than the ra&s;h wi&s;hes which our de&s;olate Condition forced from &s;ome, if not the greater part of us: So it was that undoubtedly which was mo&s;t Effectual, for our merciful God &s;ent us a &s;ea&s;onable relief, and &s;urely becau&s;e we cried unto him in our trouble, he delivered us out of our Di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Moon, which &s;hined very bright, was all of a &s;udden a little over ca&s;t, and at length a Black Cloud came, which deprived us wholly of the &s;ight of it, and gave us mighty hopes that we were go|ing to have &s;ome Rain. This gave us all new life, and &s;et us all at wotk to &s;pread out our Sails ready, &s;a&s;tening them by the four corners, with a Bullet in the Middle, to receive the VVater; thus we &s;tay|ed between hope and fear for about three hours; at la&s;t the weather grew very cool, and the Clouds gathering together, the Sky was all darkned, and &s;uddenly the rain came pouring down upon us: But never were Men more heartily glad tobe wet to the skin. The fir&s;t VVater that came thro' the Sails was very bitter; &s;o we threw that away: and then
<PB N="155" REF="88">
we fell to filling of our Ve&s;&s;els, which done, we hoy&s;ted up our wet Sails, and run briskly before the Wind.</P>
<P>One may Imagine what Joy it was to every one of us to have our mi&s;erable Condition brought to &s;uch an happy End; nor did we fail to give due thanks to the great Author of it, who had &s;o mer|cifully, heard us. VVith this VVind we were not long 'ere we reach'd the I&s;land of <HI>Engano,</HI> &s;o that we after three Months Sailing pa&s;&s;ed the Streight of <HI>Sunda,</HI> and arrived happily on the Road before <HI>Ba|tavia.</HI></P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter and the Steward, who had been &s;o imprudent as not to provide the Ship with more Wa|ter, was called to an Account for it, and puni&s;hed for their carele&s;ne&s;s, and had a good round fine laid upon them, which was to be deducted out of their wages, by little and little till the whole was payd.</P>
<P>This &s;ame Ship being de&s;ign'd for <HI>Bengal, Pegu</HI> and <HI>Aracan</HI> in a very little while, and &s;ome of the goods being ready to load, I left all my things on Board, de&s;igning to go that Voyage too.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter our Ship had got in her Complement of Sugar, Salt-peter, and Opium, we &s;et Sail and went from <HI>Bengal</HI> to <HI>Ma&s;ulipatam,</HI> belonging to the King of <HI>Galconda,</HI> who&s;e Son keeps his re&s;idence at <HI>Pentipoli,</HI> lying not far from thence.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are mo&s;t of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Re|ligion. The Air is very healthy one half of the year, when the Northern winds blow con&s;tant: But the Southern winds, which blow the other half of the year, fill the Country with di&s;tempers. We were ther&eacute; during this latter Sea&s;on, and felt the di&s;mal Effects of it. We had already lo&s;t nine of our Men, and the re&s;t were mo&s;t of'em ill of Agues or Drop|&s;ies. But ble&s;&s;ed be God, I was not at all indi&s;po|fed. The ill State we were in, made us make all the ha&s;te we could to be gone, and hoy&s;ting Sail, we departed, and came in four days time before the I&s;land <HI>Nicoparas,</HI> here we &s;ailed in very great danger; for all the Sea there abouts is full of Rocks
<PB N="158" REF="90">
that lyc three or four fathoms under Water, and little &s;mall I&s;lands, &s;ome of which are almo&s;t cover'd with Water. A little before we came by there, the <HI>Lion,</HI> a Ship of 470 Tun, run upon one of them, and was Split in pieces: But we pa&s;t them all &s;afe, and Steerd between <HI>Sumatra</HI> and <HI>Malacca,</HI> and thus got to <HI>Batavia;</HI> where I return'd to my former po&s;t. I u&s;ed to go and vi&s;it the other Surgeons that had the care of &s;ome &s;mall Forts about us, and when they had any Patients that were dangerou&s;ly ill, and their ca&s;e de&s;perate; they were &s;ent to the Ho&s;pi|tal at <HI>Batavia</HI> by vertue of a warrant from the Go|vernour, which they u&s;ed to get for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Near the Fort <HI>Jacatra,</HI> where I u&s;ed to go often, is a piece of ground which the Chinee&s;es bought of the Dutch, and co&s;t them abundance of Money, in which they bury their Corp&s;es: It was called the Chinee&s;e's Church-yard. I remember there to have &s;een a Grave made for one of the Richer &s;ort of 'em, that amounted to three or 4000 Gilders, nei|ther are they rai&s;ed high, or co&s;tly in the Ornaments they be&s;tow on 'em, but only they dig them of &s;uch a va&s;t depth, and line the Grave from the very Bot|tom with fine &s;quare Stone cut for the purpo&s;e, and &s;o &s;trong is the Work, as well as neat, that it is as if they did de&s;ign never to move from thence. I omit the other particulars of their Ceremonies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Becau&s;e others have done it before me.</P>
<P>All the way from that Fort to <HI>Batavia,</HI> is &s;o plea|&s;ant and diverting by rea&s;on of the continual variety of &s;weet Walks, Curious Gardens <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it is a perfect earthly Paradi&s;e, and there is none comes to <HI>Batavia</HI> but goes to &s;ee it, and is exceedingly Charm'd with the &s;ight of it.</P>
<P>A plea&s;ant accident be&s;ell me there once. An Officer, who was at that time a Patient of mine, a loo&s;e debauched Fellow, who followed no pre&s;crip|tions,
<PB N="159" REF="90">
and therefore made all my remedies ineffectu|al to him, being at the head of a Company exerci&s;ing the Men, and having got I &s;uppo&s;e a cup in his head, &s;eeing me come towards him to be a Spectator a|mong the re&s;t, Saluted me at fir&s;t &s;ight after a kind of an in&s;olent manner, and then gave me &s;ome Scur|rilous Language, and told me, he thought I under|&s;tood my bu&s;ine&s;s but very indifferently, &s;ince I kept him &s;o long under my hands. I told him he talkt like an Impertinent Fellow, and that all the means of the mo&s;t skilfull Surgeons in the World would be in vain to him, while he was always drunk and lived &s;uch an intemperate life, and ob&s;erved no rule. In &s;hort, I told him that my Art was to cure Men, and not Bea&s;ts, and that he might &s;eek a cure el&s;e|where; this enraged him &s;o, being &s;poken at the head of his Company, that he came and &s;truck at me with his Cane with all the eagerne&s;s that might be, but 'ere the blow fell upon me, I clo&s;ed in with him; and having no VVeapon in my hand, I wre&s;ted the Cane out of his, and flung him upon his back, as he was getting up again, the &s;tanders by parted us, and there was no more heard of it for that time.</P>
<P>This &s;pread about among all the Officers, and the Account of it being little to his advantage, and giving &s;ometimes occa&s;ion to &s;ome to jeer him with his adventure, it made him &s;tark mad; and &s;et him upon thinking of revenge. I expected it, and therefore avoided him, whenever I could han|&s;omely do it. But one day we chanced to meet in a Chinee&s;es hou&s;e, where we dined; nor did I &s;ee any tokens of his Re&s;entment all the while we &s;at together, &s;o that I was apt to think he de&s;igned to pa&s;s it by. But when he had drunk a little largely, and the ill humours were &s;et a Floating, he begun to make little in&s;olent Reflections upon me, which
<PB N="160" REF="91">
turned at la&s;t to down right abu&s;es. This did not &s;uffice, but he mu&s;t needs urge me to come out to him in the Street, and going out fir&s;t into it him&s;elf, with his drawn Sword in his hand, he vapourd and call'd me all the Cowards he could think of, who dur&s;t not come out to meet him. I wore no Sword, as indeed none of our profe&s;&s;ion did: But I had a tuck Cane in my hand, which I u&s;ed to wear; but e&s;pecially &s;ince my fir&s;t quarrel with him: And be|ing forced to it, at length I came out to him, and with my unwildy weapon after &s;ome pa&s;&s;es on both &s;ides, I &s;truck him into the left &s;ide, but glancing again&s;t his ribs, I ju&s;t larded him, and that was all; but he keeping his ground, I made another pa&s;s at him, and fortunately run him into the Shoulder, and di&s;arm'd him; upon which he was carried into the Chinee&s;es hou&s;e.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as this was made known at <HI>Batavia,</HI> we were both of us taken and brought bound into <HI>Bata|via,</HI> and there had before the Judge Advocate, who, having examined us and our Evidences, pa&s;&s;ed Sen|tence upon my Adver&s;ary in an in&s;tant, which was, that he was to be kept in Chains for three years, and to work among the Slaves; and to forfeit his Salary for the time, which was to be di&s;tributed among his Company, which was accordingly put in Execution, as &s;oon as he was perfectly recovered, and that was in a few VVeeks time.</P>
<P>My cau&s;e being much more ju&s;t than his, and my Sentence being &s;u&s;pended for a while, I thought I might come off Tolerably well; but when I con|&s;ider'd with what &s;everity they had dealt with him, I could not but expect &s;omething proportionable would fall to my &s;hare. But it was not long 'ere I was put out of doubt, and my Sentence was pronoun|ced. I was to &s;tand before the <HI>Corps de Guarde</HI> at <HI>Jacatra</HI> three days after one another, with &s;ix
<PB N="161" REF="91">
<HI>Mu&s;quets</HI> hung about me, and to forfeit three months Salary to the Judge-Advocate, and to do for that time the Duty of a private Centinel, &s;tanding &s;uch hours as were allotted me, with a Mu&s;quet in my Hand.</P>
<P>This was tolerable, and better than I expected; but it &s;eems it was rather contrived for me, that I might not go altogether unpuni&s;hed, than as a pu|ni&s;hment de&s;erved by, and &s;uitable to what I had done. One may &s;ee by this puni&s;hment that was inflicted on me, that a Martial Genius reigns there; and that they are much given to a Military Di&s;ci|pline; for there was no manner of relation between the Mu&s;quet and me, nor indeed did it agree with me at all. But &s;ome of my Friends gave me hopes, that they would &s;oon get me relea&s;ed; and by their means, orders were &s;ent me to return to my Po&s;t, after I had exerci&s;ed the Mu&s;quet during two Months; by which a Month of my Sentence was remitted me.</P>
<P>A little while after I was re&s;tored, Orders were &s;ent to the <HI>Sumatra,</HI> the Ship I was la&s;t in, to get ready in eight days to go to <HI>Bantam.</HI> I put my &s;elf in a readine&s;s to go with her, being de&s;irous to &s;ee how the Place &s;tood &s;ince its great di&s;order. The la&s;t day we were to be in Town, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> I went to Church, and heard a mo&s;t admirable Ser|mon preach'd by the worthy Mr. <HI>John Conradus;</HI> after which I took my leave of my Friends, and then took a <HI>Praw</HI> to carry me aboard the <HI>Su|matra,</HI> which had her full Lading in, which was all Provi&s;ions, and mo&s;t of that Rice. The next Morning the Wind being very fair for us, we &s;et &s;ail, and came that very Night into the Road be|fore <HI>Bantam.</HI> I went to Shore with the fir&s;t Boat, and was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee all the Parts of that City &s;o neat, and in &s;o good an order, that there was not the lea&s;t &s;ign of its late Misfortunes to be
<PB N="162" REF="92">
&s;een. I &s;taid there that night, being told that the next day eight <HI>Javians</HI> were to be executed for killing &s;ome <HI>Dutchmen</HI> in the Country; and ac|cordingly four of them were broke upon the Wheel; the other four were tied fa&s;t together, and turned down headlong off the Ca&s;tle-Bridge into the Water.</P>
<P>While this was doing, there was a va&s;t out-cry of a &s;udden of Fire: The Hou&s;es being all of Cane, the fir&s;t Hou&s;e had in an in&s;tant &s;et &s;ire to &s;everal others; &s;o that the Uproar increa&s;ing, the Magi&s;trate &s;et double guard upon all the Conveni|ent Po&s;ts and Gates of the City, to prevent further harm; and le&s;t this might be intended to &s;erve for an In&s;urrection: But both the Fire and Noi&s;e cea&s;ed quickly after.</P>
<P>I went on board again, and hearing that the Young King was in a few days to make a Vi&s;it to the Governour, I de&s;ired a Friend to give me no|tice the night before the day on which it was to be; and notice being given me accordingly by my Friend, I went to Shore.</P>
<P>The manner of his Pomp and Magnificence was, I thought, very well worth my &s;ight; and it may not be di&s;agreeable to the Reader to have a &s;hort ac|count o&s; it. As &s;oon as ever the King had &s;et his Foot out of the Ca&s;tle, all the Cannon were di&s;|charged, great and &s;mall, all round the place.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that walked before him were four <HI>Am|boinee&s;es,</HI> carrying Bucklers and Swords in their Hands; next to them went a Company of <HI>Javians,</HI> then a Company of <HI>Balingers,</HI> with <HI>A&s;&s;agyen;</HI> after the&s;e came &s;ix <HI>Javians,</HI> who carried a Chair finely wrought and gilt: then followed &s;ix Per&s;ian Hor&s;es, with Trappings richly covered with Gold and Silver; after them four <HI>Amboinee&s;es,</HI> with E&s;cutcheons and Swords in their Hands; then the Young Prince; or King's Son, of about eight Years of Age, on Hor&s;e|back; his Hor&s;e was &s;et out after the noble&s;t man|ner
<PB N="163" REF="92">
I ever &s;aw: He was attended by &s;ome hundreds of Women, each of which had &s;omething in their Hands; &s;ome, Golden Cups; &s;ome, Flowers; others, &s;everal Fruits of the Country; the&s;e were followed by the Company of <HI>Dutch.</HI> Then came the King him&s;elf, riding on a very fine Per&s;ian Hor&s;e, &s;um|ptuou&s;ly accoutred, and &s;itting with that Maje&s;ty, that one would have thought him Lord of the Univer&s;e. Next to him went a great Company of Women; then another Company of <HI>Dutch;</HI> and a Company of <HI>Javians,</HI> with their <HI>Krizzen</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;agyen,</HI> which ended the Proce&s;&s;ion. All this mighty Shew and Formality, was a very great &s;ur|prize to me, con&s;idering that King's Station, and that his Dignity was meerly titular. But that Pomp and Grandeur did not give him &s;o much lu&s;tre, as it did tho&s;e under who&s;e &s;ubjection he was forced to live: And in that con&s;ideration, I &s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>Dutch</HI> were willing enough to amu&s;e him, with this vain &s;hew of Power and Greatne&s;s. When the Guns were fired, one of the Men, not being &s;o care|ful as he &s;hould have been, had one of his Arms &s;hot off, as he was raming in the Powder. As &s;oon as the young King heard of it, he came into the Ho&s;|pital him&s;elf to &s;ee the Man dre&s;t, and to charge the Surgeon to take great care of him, and ordered an hundred pieces of Eight to be given him; promi|&s;ing withal, that if he cured him, he would give him a Pen&s;ion of two hundred pieces of Eight year|ly; which was an argument of a good tender Na|ture and Genero&s;ity, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of his Actions, before-related, might repre&s;ent him as one of a cruel and barbarous Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It was not without Wonder, as well as Plea&s;ure, that I beheld the great Re&s;tauration and Improve|ment of this Famous City, which once lay in &s;o ruinous a condition; and to &s;ee &s;uch plenty and abundance there, where &s;ome time before there was
<PB N="164" REF="93">
&s;uch a &s;carcity of nece&s;&s;aries, that many Men were ee'n fami&s;h'd. And certainly of all the hard&s;hips of that War, none was to be compared to that which we underwent for want of Water. I was once forced to give as much Mony for one &s;ingle draught of it, as would have bought a Butt of Wine in &s;ome places. And &s;uch was our lamenta|ble condition, that a Man would have given his Life the next hour for a draught of Cold Water to prolong it till then. So that when Water could be got at any rate, tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t &s;hare of Plunder, would give all they had for one &s;ingle Cup of it; and thought them&s;elves happy they could purcha&s;e it upon &s;uch ea&s;ie terms: And thus after all their labour, they were but little the better for all that Booty they had gotten.</P>
<P>But what was the mo&s;t di&s;mal of all was, that it was not to be gotten &s;ometimes, tho' one had had the World to give for it: And in tho&s;e extre|mities, many of our Men drinking out of &s;ome Pools that were not whole&s;om, &s;ome being <HI>Nitrous</HI> or <HI>Saltpeteri&s;h,</HI> and others being poi&s;onous Water, it threw them into &s;uch Di&s;tempers, and put 'em into &s;uch Tortures, that it would have grieved any one to have &s;een the mi&s;erable condition they were in.</P>
<P>In the Wars with <HI>Kartiri,</HI> which were a little before my coming to the Indies, the poor Soldiers were in as bad a condition to the full. So that a Man would wonder, that the &s;ame Per&s;ons &s;hould willingly expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;uch difficulties a &s;econd time; as mo&s;t of our Men did, who were in both Expeditions. But what will not nece&s;&s;ity put a Man upon, e&s;pecially when it is a little en|liven'd by the hopes of &s;ome fortunate Succe&s;s? And I believe, that the good Fortune of a certain Drummer in tho&s;e late Wars, &s;erved in a great mea&s;ure to animate the whole Body of our Army.
<PB N="165" REF="93">
For this Drummer lighted fortunately of the King of <HI>Kartiri</HI>'s Crown, for which the General at <HI>Ba|tavia</HI> gave him thirty thou&s;and Gilders of Dutch Mony; and gave him his Freedom, and a Pa&s;s to go into <HI>Holland,</HI> where he was to have his Mony paid, tho' the Poor Man ne're liv'd to enjoy it, for he died in the Voyages; but the Mony was duly paid to his Si&s;ters, who lived at <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> ac|cording to the agreement made with the Decea&s;ed. And I make no doubt but every one of our Men, that knew this, were in hopes of getting at lea&s;t a Crown for their &s;hare too.</P>
<P>I was one of four who had almo&s;t got as con&s;i|derable a Booty, but we lo&s;t all by our want of cu|rio&s;ity; for three of the Admiral's chief Attendants, and I, being ju&s;t come into <HI>Bantam,</HI> after a little fatigue, we went to take a Nap in a Warehou&s;e that &s;tood open, we laid us down upon a great Che&s;t that &s;tood there, and never dreamt that there was any thing of value within it; but we had not been there above half an hour, when an Officer was &s;ent from the <HI>Admiral</HI> to demand our Bed from un|der us, which we readily yielded. We were &s;trange|ly &s;urpri&s;ed when we &s;aw a Party of Men ready to convoy it to the Admiral, before whom it was open'd; and out of it came &s;even hundred Leathern Bags full of <HI>Cubangs,</HI> which (as I told you before) are pieces of Gold, worth ten Rixdollers apiece. You may imagine then how &s;illy we lookt upon one another, when we heard this; and how angry we were with our &s;elves, that we could complain of the hardne&s;s of our Bed, and were not &s;o wi&s;e as to &s;hake up the Feathers. But to be &s;hort, we lo&s;t very &s;imply a Trea&s;ure which we might have had very fairly, and without oppo&s;ition, if we had but been &s;o prudent as to &s;earch into it at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But it is time to return to the <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which was now ready to go off; &s;o that with the fir&s;t
<PB N="166" REF="94">
fair Wind we &s;et &s;ail, and got &s;afe to <HI>Batavia</HI> again, where we found a Fleet of &s;even Ships in a readi|ne&s;s to go home, <HI>i. e.</HI> to <HI>Holland.</HI> (as the cu&s;tom is to &s;end &s;ome &s;uch number of Ships home every Year, &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s at a time.) I was glad to have the opportunity to &s;end &s;ome Letters by 'em, and I did &s;o; but charging only one Friend with 'em, my Friends in <HI>Holland</HI> never re|ceived any of 'em. But what made me the more negligent was, that I was near the time of my free|dom, and in full de&s;ign of going over my &s;elf in a very little while. As &s;oon as that Fleet had hoi&s;ted &s;ail, I went to Church to join with the Prayers of the Congregation for the Fleets Pro&s;perity and good Voyage, as there is always on tho&s;e occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Our Ship lay &s;till at Anchor here for three Weeks, which made me very weary of it; at la&s;t we had Orders to go with a &s;maller Ve&s;&s;el, call'd the <HI>Bali,</HI> to a &s;mall I&s;land, about four Leagues from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to fetch Timber to repair the Ships that lay at the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> and to carry it thither. This I&s;le hath nothing but Timber upon it: Here we &s;pent our time in catching of Tortoi&s;es, with which we fea&s;t|ed our &s;elves rarely; and having carried what was requi&s;ite to the I&s;le of <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> we return'd to <HI>Ba|tavia.</HI> The <HI>Bali</HI> being but a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, we ran up the River, with ea&s;e, to the very Gate of the Ca&s;tle. The Chief Surgeon of <HI>India</HI>'s Lodging be|ing very near to us, I took the opportunity to wait upon him, and de&s;ired him to take care I might be appointed to go with the next that &s;hould be &s;ent to any di&s;tant part of the Indies, where I had not been; which he promi&s;ed to do, &s;eeing it was my de&s;ire.</P>
<P>He repre&s;ented to me &s;ufficiently, and I knew it well enough, that I had a better Po&s;t already, and that any Po&s;t at Land was more con&s;iderable than the be&s;t at Sea; and that tho&s;e who had a &s;ettled
<PB N="167" REF="94">
Charge there, were more regarded, and better e&s;teemed. But I was for &s;eeing of &s;trange Coun|tries, and variety of Things; and be&s;ides, a conti|nuance upon Land, required a continual expence, which the Sea doth not give &s;uch opportunity for. But, in a word, I would not have been penn'd up in one Town only, as &s;ome are there, for all the Credit and Advantage they can propo&s;e to them|&s;elves, or attain to; and indeed except in <HI>Bengal, Surat, Camron</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia, Japan,</HI> or &s;ome few other places, it is hardly worth a Man's while to re&s;t in hopes of being advanced; for Preferment goes there by Favour, as well as in the&s;e parts of the World: And when it doth &s;o, I think no wi&s;e Man will de|pend upon it.</P>
<P>Thus I continued upon the <HI>Bali,</HI> and as &s;oon as &s;he had taken in her lading of Linnen and Striped Stuffs, together with &s;ome Che&s;ts of Mony; we fell down the River and &s;et &s;ail for <HI>Bantam;</HI> whi|ther &s;he was bound. We were above two hours &s;ail; but we were forced back by a contrary Wind, which blew &s;o exce&s;&s;ive hard for the &s;pace of two days, that we were very happy, that we ridded our &s;elves out of it &s;o luckily. As &s;oon as it was over, we &s;et &s;ail again, and in forty eight hours we reached the Road of <HI>Bantam,</HI> where we immediately unladed.</P>
<P>When we went to Shore there, we &s;aw &s;ome thou&s;ands of Javians got together at the Mouth of the River: We were a little &s;urprized at fir&s;t, not knowing what the meaning of it &s;hould be; but coming nearer, and &s;eeing &s;everal Hollanders a|mong&s;t 'em, and then di&s;covering their Nets, Hooks and other In&s;truments, we found they were only catching of Crocodiles. When we landed, we &s;aw &s;everal they had caught and knock'd in the Head already; their King was among&s;t 'em to &s;ee the Sport. No body can think what a &s;trange kind of
<PB N="168" REF="95">
a Noi&s;e the&s;e &s;illy Javians made, and how they rent their Throats at it. Whereas my Comrade and I had caught almo&s;t as many without any kind of Noi&s;e, and not half that Trouble.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bali</HI> was only to unlade here, which being done, we &s;et out fot <HI>Batavia</HI> again; and as we came by the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> we heard all the Can|non fire, both in the Ca&s;tle, and in the City; we could not tell then what it was for, but we kept going on; and not long after, when we came to ca&s;t Anchor, we heard that the Fleet from <HI>Cameron</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> was &s;afe arrived, and had brought the good news with 'em, that all the Old Differences between the Viceroy there, and us, were perfectly adju&s;ted; and that there was a Good Corre&s;pon|dence &s;ettled between us. And another Ship was come in from <HI>Holland,</HI> which had al&s;o brought the good news of the quarrel being made up between the <HI>Engli&s;h, Danes</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and our&s;elves con|cerning the Injury done to them at <HI>Bantam:</HI> Which good news coming together, could not but make us all exceeding joyful. So that all the Streets of <HI>Batavia</HI> were all illuminated with Bon-fires, and Fire-works. The latter were chiefly the work of the Chinee&s;es, who delight much in them, and are &s;o ingenious at 'em, that one would wonder, e&s;pe|cially being a People who never have any In&s;tru|ments of War, where Powder is u&s;ed. They like|wi&s;e entertained us with their Comedies, which are very diverting, if &s;een but &s;eldom. We Ger|mans had over and above the&s;e good news, that which more nearly concerned us, which was, that of the good &s;ucce&s;s of the Emperors Arms again&s;t the Turks; &s;o that &s;ome of my Countrymen and I joined &s;o much the more chearfully in the common Rejoicings, which continued all that Night. The next Morning the General <HI>Camphuy&s;en</HI> went to the <HI>Maley&s;h</HI> Church, where publick thanks were return'd
<PB N="169" REF="95">
to God for our Pro&s;perity; then the Service being over, the Guns were again fired round the City and Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Three or four days after, as I was returning to &s;ee my Patients on board the <HI>Bali,</HI> I met with a Compa|ny of Soldiers that were going on board the <HI>Fle&s;|&s;ingen.</HI> The&s;e were very prettily accoutred with Silk-Stockings on their Legs, and Shoos made of Sail-Cloath: The&s;e Men were de&s;igned for <HI>Camron, Surat</HI> and <HI>Macaran,</HI> to fill up the vacancies there of &s;uch as keep Guard before the Hou&s;es of the Company. But I would not have a private Soldier to fancy by this, that they are all to meet with &s;uch treatment there; for this good u&s;age is only to a few, that are to credit the Factories in tho&s;e places; and tho&s;e are &s;ome of tho&s;e that have a great many Friends, and great Recommendations: Whereas many a brave Soldier is forced to &s;pend his time in <HI>Bantam, Amboina, Banda,</HI> and other un|healthy I&s;lands, where they mu&s;t trudge it without either <HI>Shoos</HI> or <HI>Stockings,</HI> and it may be peri&s;h mi|&s;erably.</P>
<P>Our Ship was once again order'd to go to <HI>Onru&s;t</HI> to carry Rice, and other Provi&s;ions; which we did, and returned in four or five days.</P>
<P>As we were come back, it was my fortune to fall once more into the Sea; for as I went to ea&s;e Na|ture on the out&s;ide of the Ship, according to the u&s;ual way, I held fa&s;t by the Rope, which broke, &s;o in I dropt. The Ships Crew was more ready to laugh at me, than to lend me their Hand; and I was doubly put to't, to &s;wim with my Breeches down; but at la&s;t my Comrade threw me out a Rope, by which I got up, and prai&s;ed God for my &s;afety. This made me more careful for ever after; and that the Boat&s;wane might be more diligent to &s;ee for the future that &s;uch things were firm and &s;trong, the Ma&s;ter gave him a &s;evere reprimand, and laid a Fine on him.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="96">
After this I went to pay another vi&s;it to the up|per Surgeon; and from thence went to Sup with an Acquaintance of mine in the Ca&s;tle, and took a Friend with me. I was to go into the Town to lie; &s;o my Friend and I took a Praw to carry us thither up the River. In the way we came thro' the Boom, which is a String of Trunks of Trees chained to|gether, which block up the River from one &s;ide to the other, &s;o that there is no pa&s;&s;ing thro' without an Officer, who &s;tands there to let you thro', who fir&s;t vi&s;its and &s;earches you, and then too you mu&s;t pay &s;o much, according to the bigne&s;s of the Ve&s;|&s;el; and this goes to the Company, who make &s;ome thou&s;ands of Gilders yearly out of it.</P>
<P>The next day we went to the Lottery, to &s;ee what Gaming there was; that was mo&s;t full of <HI>Chinee&s;es,</HI> who, as I &s;aid before, are the greate&s;t Geme&s;ters in the World. Whoever is a lo&s;er there, the Company is &s;ure to be the winner; for there is a Mony-Changer appointed by them, who &s;its to keep order among&s;t 'em, a kind of Groom-Porter; and every throw that is thrown with the Dice, there is two pence paid to him for the Company. And notwith&s;tanding that &s;ome of tho&s;e who ruin them&s;elves at play there, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to fall into a pa&s;&s;ion, and cau&s;e &s;ome di&s;order, yet there is never any di&s;turbance heard of; it being no le&s;s than Death to make any in that place: For with|out that &s;everity it would never be free from it, e&s;pecially when poor Soldiers lo&s;e &s;ometimes their whole Pay in one Night, which they have done ve|ry hard &s;ervice for a Month or two, or may be more; or when a Chinee&s;e lo&s;es all that he is worth, even his Wife and Children, nay his very Beard; nothing being more natural, than for Men in that condition to fall into exce&s;&s;ive Pa&s;&s;ion. But they dare not give it any vent there, nor make the lea&s;t noi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="96">
I could not refrain neither, but ventured &s;ix or &s;even Ducatoons, which were gone in the twink|ling of an Eye; but I pre&s;ently gave over, and took my leave of it for ever.</P>
<P>Thence I went to re&s;ide for a few days at a Friends hou&s;e, and a Countrymans of mine, one Mr. <HI>Bu&s;chbach,</HI> who had got his Freedom, having compleated his time in the Company's Service, and was in very good Circum&s;tances. He was a Man of an exceeding kind and generous Temper, and a con&s;tant Patron of all the Germans that came to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and never weary of doing them all the &s;ervice that lay in his power. I was a little indi&s;|po&s;ed at his Hou&s;e, &s;o that I &s;ent word to the Ship, that if they were ordered to go any Voyage be|fore I got better, they &s;hould give me notice of it, that they might be &s;upplied with &s;ome other Per|&s;on to go in my &s;tead. But ble&s;&s;ed be God I reco|vered in a few days, which I think verily was in &s;ome mea&s;ure owing to my Friend's care, and his facetious diverting Company; for I never met with more agreeable Company in my life.</P>
<P>His Hou&s;e &s;tood upon the <HI>Vierkant,</HI> a place &s;o called from its being a Square, where the Rice Mar|ket was kept, and feveral other Provi&s;ions, being ju&s;t at the Mouth of the River, and therefore mo&s;t commodious for all Country People to bring their Fruits by water, as well as for the Fi&s;her-boats to bring their Fi&s;h thither. There is al&s;o a &s;mall Dock for building of little Ve&s;&s;els. And all Ve&s;&s;els what|&s;oever that come by here, mu&s;t come to Shore, and be vi&s;ited by a Centinel that &s;tands there for that purpo&s;e, and is relieved every hour; and in ca&s;e any of 'em &s;hould attempt to &s;lip by, his Orders is to fire upon them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEing pretty well recover'd, tho' as yet &s;ome|what weak, I return'd on board, where I &s;pent my time but after a melancholly manner, and mo&s;t of it lying in my Hamock; yet I gathered &s;trength apace, and in &s;ome days got perfectly well.</P>
<P>There an Order came to me to remove on board the <HI>Tyger,</HI> which was to go to <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar;</HI> this I re|ceived with a great deal of &s;atisfaction, and accord|ingly went out with her. We had not been three hours under &s;ail, but &s;uch a violent Storm came
<PB N="173" REF="97">
upon us as brought our Main-Ma&s;t by the Board with &s;uch a force, that we thought our Ship was da&s;h'd in pieces; and this continuing for &s;ome time, we were obliged to cut our Gears, and hand in what we could of our Sails.</P>
<P>Our Ma&s;ter was not for going further, &s;o we went back to <HI>Batavia;</HI> and being there refitted, we &s;et Sail out again; and in three days came before <HI>Japara,</HI> which lies likewi&s;e in great <HI>Java,</HI> &s;eventy Leagues ea&s;tward of <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>This Place, which was once the Re&s;idence of the mighty Emperor of that Empire, is as much under the Dominion of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> as <HI>Bantam</HI> is. And that Emperor likewi&s;e is no more &s;uch, than meerly in Name and Title; and is as &s;ubject to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Go|vernment as the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> is, of whom I have given you an account. So that this whole I&s;land, which is above five hundred miles compa&s;s, is al|mo&s;t all in &s;ubjection to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Company. The Religion, Manners, Cu&s;toms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of the Inhabi|tants of <HI>Japara</HI> are much the &s;ame as of tho&s;e of <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P>Here we provided our &s;elves with Water, and Wood for Fuel; which being done, we wound up our Anchors, and &s;et &s;ail: The next day we pa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ix I&s;lands of <HI>Luboce,</HI> leaving them on our left, and <HI>Java</HI> on the right; and arrived to the I&s;land of <HI>Madura,</HI> which is about ten Leagues from <HI>Java.</HI> There we &s;taid a while, and then we &s;et for|ward again with the fir&s;t Gale of Wind, and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome hundreds of little I&s;lands and Rocks, which are called <HI>Pater no&s;ter,</HI> &s;ome of which we went over, whil&s;t the Sea beat mo&s;t terribly again&s;t tho&s;e Rocks which &s;tood a little above the Water, and made us very much affraid, we having no other way, but thro' them: So that we were continually &s;ounding with the Plummet. We fell foul of the Rocks four times notwith&s;tanding all our care; but
<PB N="174" REF="98">
God be thanked, without any damage. The be&s;t of that cour&s;e is, that there is &s;carcely ever any &s;tormy Winds there, by rea&s;on of the great heat the Sun gives. A few days after we got before <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> is a con&s;iderable Kingdom, and well go|vern'd. The <HI>Dutch, Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI> have all free|dom of Traffick there, as well as the Indians of all parts. It lies on the I&s;land <HI>Cebebes</HI> to the <HI>South,</HI> and reaches about an hundred Leagues; under the Line, it hath <HI>Borneo</HI> on the one &s;ide, and the <HI>Molucca</HI> I&s;lands on the other.</P>
<P>Here lay an Engli&s;h Ship, which had lo&s;t both her Surgeons in the Voyage, and were in great want of one to take care of their Men; they applied them|&s;elves not only to me, but to the Re&s;ident, to per|mit me to leave my Ship, to go with them, but it did not lie in the Governours power to free me from my Engagement in the Dutch Company. However they being drove to &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity, I went and lookt after their Patients, and I left all that was proper for 'em with one of the Ship, together with written In&s;tructions, how, and when to make u&s;e of 'em; for which they thanked me heartily, and gratified me very generou&s;ly.</P>
<P>There happen'd a Fire one Night in one of their <HI>Negerys,</HI> which was all con&s;umed in an in&s;tant, be|ing built with nothing but Bamboos, and gave &s;o great a light, that we thought it was the Day break|ing upon us again, and put us into a kind of Con|&s;ternation, till we knew what it was.</P>
<P>The People, Natives of this I&s;land, are &s;catter'd thro' all parts of the Indies; and all Nations are de|&s;irous of 'em for their Slaves, becua&s;e they are ex|ceeding faithful, diligent, and good natur'd, and make the brave&s;t Soldiers, as I have &s;een it my &s;elf in the whole time of the War of <HI>Bantam,</HI> where they daily &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves, both by their Cou|rage and Conduct. They are likewi&s;e the mo&s;t pro|fitable
<PB N="175" REF="98">
&s;ort of Servants. I have had two of them, who have got me half a Ducate on a day; &s;o that the&s;e are lookt upon as the mo&s;t valuable of all the Indians; and therefore are u&s;ed with the greate&s;t care and humanity that may be. The harde&s;t and mo&s;t &s;lavi&s;h part of their Work, is generally put upon the <HI>Malabarians,</HI> who are an ill-lookt &s;ort of Peo|ple, like the <HI>Caffers.</HI> They are &s;o black too, that they are often taken for <HI>Moors:</HI> Whereas it is a Na|tion of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> but di&s;per&s;ed here and there over all the <HI>Indies,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> are in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The right <HI>Moors</HI> are tho&s;e of the great <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Country, and the places adjacent, as <HI>Bengal, Surat, Golconda, &amp;c.</HI> but they very &s;eldom or never go out of their own Country; nor doth any body dare to take them for Slaves. As there is &s;ome of 'em as black as a Coal, &s;o there is &s;ome as white as any <HI>European</HI> whatever. They are mo&s;t of 'em very civil, hand&s;om and well &s;haped, courteous and gen|teel in their Behaviour. They are great Merchants, and very &s;incere in their Dealings; and tho&s;e I have had to do with, I have always found very generous and grateful. I had once the Son of a rich <HI>Moor</HI> under my hands, while I was at the Ho&s;pital of <HI>Bantam:</HI> He had broke his Leg, and had been left to the care of &s;ome Surgeons of that Nation, who had done him no good. The Father at length de|&s;pairing of the skill of his Countrymen, &s;ent for me, and &s;hew'd a great deal of rational concern for his Son's condition. I went to the Boy, and ha|ving examined the Fraction, and found it to be bet|ter than I imagined; I told the Father he might take Courage, and that I did not doubt but I &s;hould in a little while &s;et his Son upon his Legs again, with the help of the Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth; (making u&s;e of tho&s;e Terms, becau&s;e it is in that Idea e&s;pecially, that the <HI>Moors</HI> wor&s;hip God:) Upon which he bowed and lift up his Eyes
<PB N="176" REF="99">
towards Heaven. I &s;ent for my Boy, and with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a <HI>Moor,</HI> I &s;et the Bone of the Boy's Leg; and having done all that was nece&s;&s;ary for the pre|&s;ent, my Young Patient found ea&s;e immediately. This gave the Father much &s;atisfaction, and he im|mediately pre&s;ented me with twenty <HI>Spani&s;h Mat|ten,</HI> telling me that was nothing of my pay, but to encourage me to take what carel could of his Child. Thus, with God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, I cured his Boy entirely in &s;ix Weeks time; and without asking me, what I expected, he gave me thirty <HI>Cubanz</HI> into my hands, which amounted to three hundred Rixdollers, and ask'd me whether that &s;atisfi'd me. I told him it did extreamly well; and truly well it might, for in our Country we knew nothing of &s;uch large Fees as tho&s;e are. If we had but a few &s;uch Patients there, it would keep a great many at home, who are now forced to ramble abroad, meerly to get their liveli|hood.</P>
<P>But I return now to my Ship, which was ready to &s;et &s;ail again for <HI>Batavia,</HI> and waiting only for a Wind. Therefore with the fir&s;t Ea&s;terly Wind, we &s;et out of the Port of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar,</HI> and running happi|ly thro' the <HI>Pater-no&s;ter I&s;lands,</HI> we came to Anchor before <HI>Japara,</HI> where we found three Ships come from <HI>Batavia,</HI> three days before us; and had brought &s;ome Soldiers from thence, to quel an uproar that had been made at <HI>Japara,</HI> in which above twenty Dutch had been killed by the Inhabitants, who at|tempted to throw them&s;elves into the Fort <HI>Sambura.</HI> But by the means of the Governor, and this Auxilia|ry Force, all was quieted, and the Ringleaders &s;ent away to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where they receiv'd their due re|ward. Some of them were broken upon the Wheel, &s;ome had their Ears and No&s;es cut off; and were &s;ent chained altogether to &s;ome I&s;lands to &s;pend all their Life in burning of Lime, and there to remain perpetual Slaves.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="99">
I Landed before the&s;e Wretches were &s;ent away, &s;o that I &s;aw 'em go along Chain'd together: But that which was the mo&s;t di&s;mal to &s;ee, was the La|mentation and &s;ad Out-cries of the&s;e poor Fellow's Wives and Children, who conducted them to the Water-&s;ide.</P>
<P>All being thus &s;ettled again, the Company aug|mented the Garri&s;on, and fortified tho&s;ePlaces which needed it mo&s;t, to prevent any &s;uch Di&s;orders for the future. It is a wonderful Thing, that &s;uch are not more frequent; and that whenever they happen, they are &s;o &s;oon Calm'd, con&s;idering the va&s;tne&s;s of the Dutch Dominions, which are &s;o &s;catter'd here and there, and &s;o far a&s;under; but it is to be a&s;crib'd to their vigilant, and wi&s;ely Model'd Go|vernment; without which, they could not &s;upport the weight of their &s;everal Dominions, which con|tain &s;everal Empires, Kingdoms, and large Pro|vinces, (all which would be too tedious to &s;etdown) and it would amaze one to think, what a va&s;t num|ber of Deputies, Pre&s;idents, Governours, and Of|ficers, they are forced to maintain for the Pre&s;erva|tion of their Power; be&s;ides &s;ome Hundreds of Ships: And, I dare &s;ay, by good Computation, they have above a Hundred thou&s;and Men by Sea and Land. But as their Expence is great, &s;o their Wealth is unaccountable; for where-ever you go, you &s;hall not &s;ee one Thing in a thou&s;and, little or great, but if you ask who&s;e that is, all the an&s;wer is, the Company's.</P>
<P>We departed from <HI>Japara,</HI> and came the next day into the Road before <HI>Batavia,</HI> and an hour or two after us, came in the Ship that had tho&s;e Re|bels on board: &s;o that there we &s;aw them Executed, and di&s;po&s;ed of as I have &s;aid already.</P>
<P>Before our Ship was quite Unladen, here aro&s;e a mo&s;t terrible Hurricane, which tore mo&s;t of the Ships off their Anchors, and drove two of them
<PB N="178" REF="100">
upon &s;ome of the little I&s;lands, that lie near there; one of which being old and decayed, was da&s;ht in|to pieces. It la&s;ted but half an hour, and &s;o the Damage was the le&s;s, el&s;e there would hardly a Ship have e&s;caped: Ours had ca&s;t out five Anchors, two of which we lo&s;t; and two of our Men being in the Long-Boat, the Storm coming upon them &s;o &s;ud|denly, could not make to the Ship, but the Rope breaking, were torn off from us. When the Wind cea&s;ed, we went to &s;ee after'em, and found our poor Seamen &s;till alive, but that was all, tied fa&s;t by Cords to the Boat which floated with the bottom upwards; So that all were recover'd: But it was a Miracle, that being &s;o far &s;pent as they were, and not able to help them&s;elves, their Brains were not knockt out again&s;t the Boat; or that they were not devoured by Sharks. Be&s;ides all this, abundance of &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, Prawen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were ca&s;t away; and many Per&s;ons drown'd.</P>
<P>The next day I went to &s;hore with the Ma&s;ter and the Factors, who de&s;ign'd to &s;tay there all Night, and ordered the Seamen to go back to their Ship. I de&s;ired they might &s;tay till the Evening, becau&s;e I had a mind to go with 'em. But it being pretty dark, and the Wind very high, our Seamen keep|ing up the Sail without Fear or Wit, we were all over-turn'd, within a Stone's throw of the Ship; but by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the &s;peedy A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Ship's Crew, we were all took up Safe.</P>
<P>The next Morning I return'd to Land, where I was no &s;ooner come, but a <HI>Muck Speeler,</HI> who had done a great deal of Mi&s;chief, and put the People in an Uproar, came running by me, and by good Fortune did me no harm; but kill'd a Boy within 20 Steps of me, and was pre&s;ently Shot him&s;elf in the Head, and dropt down; but it was after he had kill'd five or &s;ix People: Nothing &s;aved me but the corner of the Street, by means of which, as he
<PB N="179" REF="100">
run &s;o furiou&s;ly, he over-&s;hot me, and got pa&s;t me before I could get aware of him; and &s;o, God be prais'd, I was &s;afe, but ever &s;ince I was always upon my guard at Turnings and Cro&s;&s;ings of Streets.</P>
<P>Here I &s;pent my time with a great deal of variety of Diver&s;ions, as Fi&s;hing, Walking, Shooting, go|ing by Water, and chiefly &s;eeing my Friends: Mo&s;t days I took a Praw, and went to &s;ome &s;mall I&s;lands that lie hard by there, where the chief Fi&s;hing is to be &s;een. Upon one of the&s;e I&s;lands lived a rich Chi|ne&s;e near to the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>'s Temple. He having a nu|merous Family of Children and Servants, I had fre|quent Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Hou&s;e, and got a great deal of Money by him. One Night, as I had taken my leave of him, and was going home, I &s;aw a bright Flame at a mighty di&s;tance, and heard &s;ome Shoot|ing: Being Landed, I took &s;ome of my Friends with me to a high part of the Shore to &s;ee it. We were all amazed to think what it &s;hould be, and in giving our &s;everal Opinions, we &s;pent all the Night look|ing upon it. In the Morning the Flame could no longer be &s;een; but we hearing &s;till a Gun go off now and then, we went and acquainted the General with it, who order'd a Boat to be &s;et out with 20 Men and an Officer, ready to go at Night, in ca&s;e the Flame appeared again, and the Shooting continued. As the Day &s;hut in, the Flame begun to be &s;een more and more, and &s;omewhat nearer than the Night before. I de&s;ired the Officer that I might go with him, which he readily granting, we &s;et forward, and made directly up to the Fire: Coming nearer, we &s;aw it was a &s;mall Bark and People in it, we Hail'd them, upon which they gave over Shooting, but made us no An&s;wer. This made us the more Earne&s;t to get up to 'em, and to Board 'em, which we did: And there we &s;aw a mo&s;t lamentable Sight, eight poor Engli&s;hmen, three of 'em Dead, and the five others little better, not able to &s;peak

We took them into our Boat with us, together with &s;ome Che&s;ts of <HI>Tanges</HI> and <HI>Larines,</HI> (which is a certain Mo|ney of that Country) which they had in their Boat with them; we u&s;ed them as gently as we could, and made all &s;peed po&s;&s;ible to the Place from whence we came, and there gave them all Kind of Refre&s;h|ment. It was five or &s;ix hours e'er they came to them&s;elves, &s;o as to &s;peak: At length they gave us an Account of them&s;elves; and told us, they be|long'd to an Engli&s;h Ship that came from <HI>Bengal</HI> richly laden, and was Bound for <HI>Batavia</HI> to joyn the Engli&s;h Merchant-men that lay there; but com|ing by the I&s;land <HI>Engano,</HI> it being hard Weather, they were thrown upon a Shelf, where their Ship was &s;unk, &s;o that of 78 Men they had on Board, but 15 got into that little tatter'd Boat, and that of them there was but tho&s;e we &s;aw left; the re&s;t having peri&s;hed one after another for want of Wa|ter, which they had not had a Drop of in 15 or 16 days time.</P>
<P>When we had this Account from them, we took them to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and carried them to the Engli&s;h Hou&s;e, where we were heartily Thank'd, and treated with great Civility: Be&s;ides all which, the next Morning a Reward was &s;ent to every one of the Soldiers, and to the Officer: And as for me, Having been very Helpful to them, and managed them with &s;ome Cordials, and taking Care le&s;t their &s;udden Refre&s;hment &s;hould do them an Injury, I had 20 Ducatoons &s;ent me as a Pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>While I remain'd here, there happen'd nothing more worth taking Notice of: And now Orders were &s;ent me to repair on Board the <HI>Bergen</HI> in <HI>Nor|weegen,</HI> which was to go Commadore, with two other Ships bound for <HI>Odia,</HI> the capital City of <HI>Siam;</HI> &s;o that I went and provided my &s;elf with all that was nece&s;&s;ary for the Voyage: Which being done,

I went on Board my Ship, the Fleet being ready to go off, and we &s;hould have &s;et Sail the very nextday, had not the <HI>Eker&s;loo,</HI> one of our three Ships, &s;prung a Leak, which obliged us to &s;tay while they took all the Goods out of her again, and mended her, which was a whole fortnight.</P>
<P>This done, &s;he had her Lading put in again; and then we went under Sail with a favourable Wind, and next day pa&s;s'd by the I&s;le of <HI>Lucapara;</HI> and thus we continued our Cour&s;e with good Succe&s;s for about eight days: But as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for two or three Ships to make &s;o con&s;iderable a Voyage without &s;ome Lett or Misfortune; the <HI>Eker&s;loo</HI> &s;truck upon a Bank of Sand, which frighted us all very much. As &s;oon as &s;he gave us notice of it by firing a Gun, for we were a good way before her, but had happily Steer'd a&s;ide and mi&s;s'd the Bank, we immediately &s;et out our Shallops, and went to her, and found there was no Remedy but Unlading her; which we did with all &s;peed, and be&s;towed the Goods, partly on Board of our Ship, and partly on the other: It was a great happine&s;s that the Wind was not very high, el&s;e we could never have done this. When all the Goods were out, we made &s;hift, by means of ca&s;ting Anchors, to get her off the Bank; and having examined her within, and found &s;he had no Damage done to her Keel, we put the Goods on Board of her again, and continued our Cour&s;e, thanking God we had e&s;caped &s;uch a great Danger, by the favour of the Wind, which &s;till continued good for us.</P>
<P>This happen'd to us in our Cour&s;e to <HI>Tumbolan</HI> and <HI>Ananibo</HI> as we &s;ailed between <HI>Borneo</HI> and <HI>Ma|lacca,</HI> from which in three days we reach'd the I&s;land <HI>Matuna.</HI> As we pa&s;s'd by it, we &s;aw &s;ome Ships before us, which we concluded were <HI>Chine&s;e Jonckers;</HI> About night they pa&s;s'd by us directing their Cour&s;e towards <HI>Borneo,</HI> which made us think they came

from <HI>Cambodia.</HI> At break of day we &s;aw five more, who likewi&s;e pa&s;t by us about Noon, and &s;teer'd their Cour&s;e towards <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>When we were come up to the corner of that I&s;land, we took the Elevation of the Pole, and found we were to Sail more to the Northward; and in a &s;hort time we came to the River, which runs through the Kingdom of <HI>Siam,</HI> up which we &s;ailed as far as the Town <HI>Bontempia,</HI> and there we ca&s;t Anchor. Our Ma&s;ter and the Factor went &s;traightway in the Long-Boat to the Chief City <HI>Odia;</HI> which is 30 Leagues up the River; as &s;oon as they were come back they went to Unlading.</P>
<P>I then went on Shore too, and vi&s;ited the Dutch Factory there. The Hou&s;e which the Dutch Fa|ctors have there, is amazing both for its Largene&s;s Beauty, and Strength. Above, are all the Lodgings, which are wonderful Stately both without and with|in: Under, are the Warehou&s;es, which are of a va&s;t bigne&s;s, and richly &s;tored with all manner of Commodities.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Odia</HI> is very large; but mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are very low: So that all the Towers of their Temples (which are computed to be above Five thou&s;and) being rais'd much higher, and be|ing all ea&s;ily &s;een by rea&s;on of the other Buildings being &s;o low, &s;eem altogether like a Fore&s;t in Win|ter. It is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to conceive what va&s;t numbers of People is continually moving about in that City, in&s;omuch, that a Man who is newly come, would be apt to ask what's the matter, and take that for a gathering of the Mob, or an un|u&s;ual Croud, which is but the u&s;ual Concour&s;e of the Town. It is &s;eated upon the River <HI>Menan,</HI> which is likewi&s;e fill'd with Ships, Praws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This River is of the &s;ame Nature with the <HI>Nile,</HI> the <HI>Niger,</HI> and the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and like them, over|flows all the Fields about <HI>Odia,</HI> and makes them ve|ry

fruitful; &s;preading it &s;elf over great part of the Country, by means of &s;everal Arms or Creeks which Providence hath ordered for that purpo&s;e. And be&s;ides this Advantage which this Inundation affords to the Country, it is a mighty Fence to the City <HI>Odia;</HI> becau&s;e the River over-flowing at cer|tain Sea&s;ons, no Enemy can Be&s;iege it but for &s;ome Months, during which the City is always able to defend it &s;elf, being extraordinary well Situated and Fortified.</P>
<P>Through mo&s;t of the Streets run fine Channels, as at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> &s;o that one may go with a Boat from one part of the Town to the other, which renders it mighty Commodious for Trade; I may &s;ay, that con&s;idering all things, there is not a finer City in all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>Our Ships having now in little more than a Fortnights time unladen, and taken in their full Lading, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;everal Commodities, as Buck and Roe-Skins, Jappan-Wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we fell down the River, and with a fair Northerly Wind &s;et Sail homewards again.</P>
<P>The next day it Snowed &s;o hard, and the Wind was &s;o high, that we were drove almo&s;t upon Land 'ere we could be aware of it; but by good Pro|vidence we came off without any hurt, and in 11 days came up with the I&s;land <HI>Puloaura;</HI> where we lay &s;till three days refre&s;hing our &s;elves, and then continued our Cour&s;e. We arrived at <HI>Batavia</HI> in three Weeks: We were hardly come into Harbour when we &s;aw the mo&s;t di&s;mal Spectacle that can be. The Ship the <HI>Elephant,</HI> which rode at Anchor hard by us, laden with Powder and other Ammunition de&s;ign'd for <HI>Bantam,</HI> by &s;ome Accident took Fire; and in an in&s;tant blew up into a thou&s;and pieces; &s;o that of above 80 Men that were on Board her, there was not one left alive to tell how it came. It was the mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;ight methoughts I ever

had &s;een, to behold &s;o many humane Bodies to&s;s'd at &s;uch a va&s;t di&s;tance into the Air, for &s;ome of them went over our Ship, and &s;o did &s;everal large pieces of the Ship likewi&s;e; and what made it the more di&s;mal, was, that no manner of help could be afforded them.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of going a&s;hore with the re&s;t, I went on Board a Ship that was come hither &s;ome days be|fore us from <HI>Cameron</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> becau&s;e the Chi|rurgeon which belonged to that Ship was a Coun|tryman and intimate Acquaintance of mine, and we had been together in &s;everal Expeditions in the Wars of <HI>Bantam.</HI> He was over-joyed to &s;ee me, and I was no le&s;s plea&s;ed to find him well. Af|ter many Que&s;tions pa&s;t on both &s;ides, we came to give one another an Account of our Adventures &s;ince we parted, which gave him occa&s;ion to tell me, that he had had pretty good Fortune in all his Voyages, but that he had narrowly e&s;caped Death in a place where he thought him&s;elf mo&s;t &s;ecure: For, &s;aith he, When I fir&s;t went to Shore at <HI>Cameron,</HI> I went with &s;ome of my Companions to the Factor's Hou&s;e, and having &s;poken with them I had Bu&s;ine&s;s with, we went into a <HI>Cabaret</HI> or pub|lick-Hou&s;e; whence, after we had &s;taid an hour or little more, we thought to go back to our Ships; but ere we could get to our Boats the Night catcht us, and we were &s;et upon by a company of Cut|throats. They out-did us in number, and were well Arm'd, whereas none of us had any Weapon about us, &s;o that we could make but a fruitle&s;s Re|&s;i&s;tance. Flight being the be&s;t Remedy, I pre&s;ume we all attempted it; but three of us only e&s;caped their Hands, yet not altogether neither; for I had &s;everal Blows from 'em, and was run through in two places; the two others had their &s;hare too; but neither of us three got any further hurt, and we have great rea&s;on to thank the Almighty God
<PB N="185" REF="103">
who delivered us out of their Hands; for whatever they did with the re&s;t of our Company, which were five more, we never yet could learn what became of 'em.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e &s;peaking of <HI>Cameron,</HI> told me, That while he was there, there had been &s;uch an Earth|quake as had thrown down &s;everal Hou&s;es, and kill'd &s;everal hundreds of People.</P>
<P>Our next talk was about our own Country, to which we having both of us an Inclination to re|turn, we agreed there in an in&s;tant to take our Mea&s;ures about it; for both of us had &s;erved the Company our due time, and &s;ome Months over. So we went together on Board my Ship, and from thence we took a Boat to Shore, and went together to wait upon the Head Chirurgion, to acquaint him with our De&s;ign, and to de&s;ire him to Em|ploy us now on Land till the Fleet went off for <HI>Holland.</HI> He received us with great Civility, and did what we reque&s;ted of him; and gave us part of the Ho&s;pital in Charge, as I had had before. This being done, We went each of us to our re|&s;pective Ships to take our leave of 'em, and to fetch our Things, and return'd in the &s;ame Praw to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where we repair'd to our Po&s;t, and propo&s;ed to our &s;elves to take &s;uch Care, that there might be no Cau&s;e of Complaints, lea&s;t they &s;hould prove an ob&s;tacle to our De&s;igns, as it frequently happens.</P>
<P>We had not been long here, but a Ship arrived from <HI>Holland.</HI> All the People that came in her, which were above 200 Soldiers, be&s;ides Seamen, were pre&s;ently landed, and drawn up before the Ca&s;tle-Gate, till an Order came from the General for them to march up to his Apartment in the Ca&s;tle. I went to &s;ee them, for as the Reader may well &s;uppo&s;e, every Body is de&s;irous to hear how Matters &s;tand at home, and is in Expectation

to meet with &s;ome Acquaintance. I found one there whom I had &s;ome Knowledge of, a Mer|chant's Son of <HI>Suabia,</HI> but had lived a long time at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> where I had &s;een him.</P>
<P>When I had given him the Welcome, and he me an Account of his Voyage, he rejoyced me with the good News of our Victories over the <HI>Ottomans.</HI></P>
<P>While we were Talking, the Order came from the General to let them march into the Ca&s;tle; where they had each of them their &s;everal Po&s;ts and Stations a&s;&s;ign'd. But as all New-Comers have three &s;everal Days liberty to refre&s;h them&s;elves, I took my Acquaintance with me, to &s;hew him the Civility of the place, (which is commonly &s;peak|ing, not very great). I took him out de&s;igning to go to a <HI>Negery,</HI> about two miles from <HI>Batavia:</HI> But as we were going up the River in a Praw we had taken, we met &s;ome <HI>Javians</HI> coming down in a &s;mall Boat, making a mighty noi&s;e with &s;ome little Bells. We ask'd them the meaning of it; they told us that it was a Wedding, and that that was their Mu&s;ick. So we re&s;olved to go back with them, and &s;ee the manner of 'em: They went to an Hou&s;e about a quarter of a Mile out of the Ci|ty. We were invited to come in. The Hou&s;e was all &s;et out and &s;trewed with Flowers, and &s;everal Mats made of Rice-Straw were laid upon the Ground, on which they were to have their Dinner.</P>
<P>After a great many Ceremonies were pa&s;t, which I have given an Account of already, a Buffle was brought, which the Bridegroom knockt down, and the Bride took a Knife and cut his Throat. Then they by turns cut pieces of the Fle&s;h, which they gave to the Cook to Dre&s;s, giving him at the &s;ame time In&s;tructions how they would have it done, and Herbs to do it with. Some of it was ordered upon our Account, but we neither of us

cared to be Sharers of &s;uch a tough Entertainment, and they being but a meaner &s;ort of People, we thank'd them for the Civility they had &s;hewn us, and &s;o left 'em.</P>
<P>From thence we return'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> for the day was &s;hutting in; and no New-Comer may ab|&s;ent him&s;elf from his Po&s;t the fir&s;t Night, where|fore we deferr'd our de&s;igned Walk till the next day.</P>
<P>That night one of the Ca&s;tle-Gates was open'd, (which is a thing &s;eldom known) to let out the Pre&s;ident of the City; who, together with &s;ome others of the Council, had been at Supper with the General.</P>

<P>THE next day we took a <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Praw to pur&s;ue our De&s;ign, and went up the River to the <HI>Negery.</HI> In our way, we came to a &s;trong Current, which being very &s;hallow, the Head of our Boat &s;truck upon a Rock and turn'd us over. We were in no danger of our Lives becau&s;e it was not deep, but we were Duck'd over Head and Ears; but we got up and drew our Praw to Land, and &s;o got in again, and went forwards.</P>
<P>We went there into a publick Hou&s;e that &s;tood not far from the Water-&s;ide upon an Eminence, which afforded us a very agreeable Pro&s;pect, and &s;at us down in a very plea&s;ant Arbour, with Cedar-Trees, Limon-Trees, and other Green-Trees of

that kind all about us. We cau&s;ed a Dinner to be got ready for us of what the Country afforded; which was Fi&s;h and Fowl, Eggs, Herbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our Liquor was <HI>Suri,</HI> which is a Juice drawn from the Coco-Trees; with that, we made very good <HI>Ma&s;|&s;ack</HI> and <HI>Lemonade,</HI> by the help of &s;ome Sugar, Spices, Limons, and Oranges, which we had in good plenty.</P>
<P>I having a mind to make my Friend merry, and to divert him with variety, I &s;ent for &s;ome <HI>Gom|gomers,</HI> (the Mu&s;icians of that Country) and &s;ome <HI>Javian Baliar</HI> Dancers, who made us a great deal of Pa&s;time. The <HI>Baliar</HI> Dancers, which come from <HI>Babylon,</HI> I have &s;poken of before; but the&s;e were <HI>Javians,</HI> which are a &s;ort far inferiour to them, and differ from them much in the &s;ame manner as there is between a Dance performed by a Dancing-Ma&s;ter and one danced by a Ru&s;tick: But what was mo&s;t Diverting to us, e&s;pecially to my Friend, was, &s;ome Tumblers and Jugglers that were among&s;t 'em, who &s;hew'd us &s;everal Tricks, which do u&s;ual|ly &s;o much &s;urprize, even tho&s;e that &s;ee them, that I know a Man runs &s;ome risk in relating of them. However, &s;ome of their mo&s;t con&s;iderable Tricks of Activity I cannot wholly pa&s;s pa&s;s by.</P>
<P>They were five in number: One of 'em laid him|&s;elf flat down upon his Belly, upon a Mat they had &s;pread on the Ground, and in the twinkling of an Eye, rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his Legs; then laying him&s;elf down again as before, he rais'd him&s;elf af|ter the &s;ame manner, and &s;tood upon his Head on|ly: After this he laid him&s;elf upon his Back, and gave &s;everal Leaps in the Air like a Fi&s;h. The other four did the &s;ame Tricks over, one after the other, and &s;till better and better. After this they took a Ladder of about 12 Rounds, and &s;et it again&s;t one of 'em; one of the other four got up to the top of it, and laid him&s;elf a cro&s;s it; the
<PB N="190" REF="106">
&s;econd went up, and &s;at a-cro&s;s theother's Shoulders; the third climb'd up and pitch'd him&s;elf on his Head, upon the Head of the &s;econd, and there &s;tood with his Feet directly upwards; upon which, the fourth came, and &s;tood upright on the Feet of the third; And after playing &s;everal Tricks there, he leapt down on the Ground, and &s;tood &s;till; the next Fel|low, that was &s;till &s;tanding on his Head, gave a &s;pring upwards, and falling down, lighted on the Shoulders of him that &s;tood below; the next, who was on the Ladder came down likewi&s;e with a Leap, and fell a-cro&s;s the Shoulders of him; and &s;o did the fourth and la&s;t, who had been the fir&s;t on the Ladder: He that had &s;tood all this while, and held the foot of the Ladder, took it and climb'd up with it to the top of the other four, and there made a &s;ort of Harangue to us in <HI>Japponne&s;e,</HI> which con|cluded the Sight. There was a great many other Tricks intermixt with the&s;e, which were well worth the taking notice of; but I thought the&s;e would &s;uffice to &s;hew you, how far the&s;e Men out-do any thing we commonly &s;ee in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>This being over, we call'd for our Reckoning in, which came to no more than Two thou&s;and <HI>Butgis.</HI> An <HI>European</HI> at fir&s;t is frightned at &s;uch a reckoning as this, and thinks that &s;uch a Sum of Money &s;hould be enough to Treat a King and all the Nobility, or to defray the Charges of a Lord Mayor's Fea&s;t; but he mu&s;t under&s;tand, that the&s;e <HI>Butgis</HI> are but little thin pieces of Lead, with holes in the middle of 'em, a certain number of them is put upon a String to &s;ave the trouble of telling them over upon every occa&s;ion, and three Hundred of 'em are worth but Two Pence of Dutch Money; &s;o that our Dinner amounted but to 13 or 14 <HI>d.</HI> Be&s;ides this, our Mu&s;ick and Dancers co&s;t us a Shil|ling, and we gave a Ducatoon to the Juglers and Tumblers; having paid all, we went back again down the River to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="106">
At this very time the Streight of <HI>Sunda</HI> was very much infe&s;ted with Pickaroons; They had only Praws or &s;mall Boats of their own, with which they run with ea&s;e in and out of &s;everal Rivers of the Kingdom of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and did a great deal of mi&s;chief about the I&s;lands of <HI>Toppers-hoedie, Dwar&s;|in-de-zee,</HI> and others. They u&s;ed to wait there for their Prey, and when they had gotten their Booty, they made immediately to their lurking holes, where finding &s;afety for a great while, they were at la&s;t &s;o bold, that not a Ship could &s;cape them; and the more, becau&s;e the Company never concerned them|&s;elves about it, nor took any Mea&s;ures to &s;uppre&s;s them. But at length, the <HI>Bali,</HI> (the Ship in which I had been &s;ome time before) coming that way, bound for <HI>Jambi</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> and be|ing obliged to ca&s;t Anchor near the afore&s;aid I&s;lands, the&s;e Pyrates joyning their Forces together, came and &s;urrounded her, and notwith&s;tanding a &s;tout Defence made on Board the <HI>Bali</HI> for &s;ome hours, they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of her, killed all the Men they could come at; and having taken what they could conveniently carry away, &s;et it on Fire.</P>
<P>While the Ship was all in Flames, a Ship from <HI>Malabar</HI> coming luckily by, made towards the Fire to &s;ee what it was. Two Men, who in the En|gagement had hid them&s;elves below Deck, and were now got out, but knew not how to di&s;po&s;e of them|&s;elves, &s;tood upon the Fore-Ca&s;tle ready to throw them&s;elves into the Sea to avoid being burnt: But they &s;ent them a Boat, by which means the&s;e poor Creatures were pre&s;erved; and being brought on Board the Ship, they continued their Cour&s;e to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where they gave the General an Ac|count of what had happen'd.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="107">
The Company now being Sufferers by this, thought fit to &s;end after the&s;e Pyrates, which they never minded before, while they came by no lo&s;s them&s;elves, and while the Fi&s;hermen only, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were in danger. Immediately two Men of War were ordered to go after 'em, together with eight &s;mall Boats well Mann'd, to give them Chace. It being requi&s;ite there &s;hould be Chirurgions more than ordinary in tho&s;e Ships, and this being like to be a &s;hort Expedition, and near home, my Friend and I, who could not be employed in a long Voy|age, were appointed to go with them. We were very well pleas'd with our Commi&s;&s;ion, and accord|ingly we got ready our Che&s;ts, and went on Board the <HI>Ceylon,</HI> which carried 300 Men, and 48 Guns: The other Ship was about the &s;ame Rate. The Boats had each of them from 60 to 70 Men, and about 16 Patterero's.</P>
<P>When we were got pa&s;t the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> we kept along the Sea-&s;hore till we came beyond <HI>Ban|tam,</HI> and there we lay before the Mouth of &s;ome Rivers, as clo&s;e to the Land as we could: And &s;o as to lye to the Windward. At Night we divided our Fleet, and &s;ent two of our Boats out to Sea to entice the Pirates out after them, if they &s;hould chance to &s;ee them, and we &s;tood ready to clap in between them, and the River; &s;o to cut off their Pa&s;s, and hedge them in. We lay two days clo&s;e to the Shore, within a Stone's throw of Land, but very &s;afe, with no le&s;s than 60 Fathom Water. Atlength, about Sun-&s;et, we &s;aw five Boats making Sail towards our two Boats, at about two Leagues di&s;tance from us; upon which we moved altogether forwards, along the Shore; and by that time it was quite dark, we made directly towards 'em, taking &s;till care to be between the Shore and them.</P>

They having found out our De&s;ign, were endeavouring to make their e&s;cape, for the two Boats we had &s;ent after 'em were far|ther from 'em than we were with the whole Fleet: So we joyned together again, and our eight Boats &s;ailing much fa&s;ter than the Men of War could, pur&s;ued them &s;o tightly, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e Rovers had &s;everal Oars with them, (which they u&s;e to make u&s;e of in a Calm or in ca&s;e of pur&s;uit) yet by Noon our Boats were all got within a quar|ter of a League of 'em; &s;o that the la&s;t of 'em were forced to yield or fight. We with our great Ships were within a League of 'em all, and turn'd round a &s;mall I&s;land, during which we lo&s;t &s;ight of them: But our Boats all this while having got ground, they begun to thunder among&s;t 'em; &s;o that in a little time, two of the Pyrates Boats were &s;eized. Then we came in &s;ight again, and took the&s;e two Boats into our Charge, and brought the Men on Board of us. Our Boats having made &s;ome &s;tay, while they engaged the&s;e two, the other three were got away again pretty far. However, ours were not long 'ere they came within &s;hot of 'em, and &s;o pur&s;ued them that they came to a clo&s;e En|gagement, and after a &s;harp re&s;i&s;tance, at length became Ma&s;ters of them.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t in all 28 Men, and had 30 wounded; but we kill'd 200, and wounded above 50 of theirs. The re&s;t we carried to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>There was at fir&s;t near 900 of 'em; of which nine were Dutchmen, and two Danes; one of whom had been a Captain of a Man of War. We caught both the Danes, but we had but three Dutch|men, the &s;ix others were killed in the &s;ight.</P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Batavia,</HI> they were all put into Pri&s;on, and Examin'd. They confe&s;s'd, that they had their Habitations in &s;ome <HI>Negery</HI>'s, about the
<PB N="194" REF="108">
<HI>Blaw Peper-bergh,</HI> and di&s;cover'd &s;everal of their Companions thereabouts: Upon which they &s;ent Soldiers both by Sea and Land towards tho&s;e places; and in three Week's time they brought back with 'em &s;ome thou&s;ands of 'em, mo&s;t of 'em being <HI>Javians.</HI></P>
<P>Of the whole, one part was broke upon the Wheel, &s;ome were Quarter'd, &s;ome were Whipt, &s;ome had their Ears and No&s;es cut off, and &s;ome were burnt in the Forehead. The three Hollan|ders were Hang'd: The two Danes Beheaded: and a great number of others were &s;ent to &s;everalI&s;lands; to Burn Lime, Hew Stone, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there to re|main Slaves all their Lives. Their Wives and Children were &s;erved after the &s;ame manner, that it might more effectually prove a terrour to others.</P>
<P>About this time came into the Road of <HI>Batavia</HI> a Ship from <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> which brought with her two and twenty Savages from the I&s;land St. <HI>Galle.</HI> They were much uglier and much more bruti&s;h than the <HI>Hottentots</HI> at the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> their Speech was hardly articulate, but confu&s;ed like that of Children, and as if they Sung. They had no Hair on their Heads, only a rough &s;cabby Skin. They were &s;trong, tho' exce&s;&s;ive Lean, and had &s;carce any thing but Skin and Bones. Before their Privy-Parts they had a Wild-Cat's Skin, which reach'd down to their Knees; for in St. <HI>Galle</HI> there are multitudes of Wild-Cats.</P>
<P>They were &s;hut up all together, like Bea&s;ts in a Stable, and were fed with nothing but raw Rice and Water, which it &s;eems was too good for 'em; for in a little while they all died. A na&s;tier &s;ort of Men I never &s;aw; for as I &s;aid, except their Head, they were Hairy all over to their very Hands and Feet. Their Face was very red; but their Teeth were very fine and white: Their Eyes were very large; and their large Ears &s;lit in five or &s;ix places.
<PB N="195" REF="108">
About their Neck and Feet they had &s;ome Twi&s;ts of Sea-Ru&s;hes; which their Women made u&s;e of likewi&s;e to bear up their long &s;wagging Brea&s;ts. I believe the World doth not afford a more Sa|vage Wild &s;ort of Men. St. <HI>Galle,</HI> from which they came, lies about 1300 miles from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and about 300 from the Cape, on the &s;ide of the I&s;land <HI>Ma|daga&s;car.</HI></P>
<P>Some time after this, a <HI>Javian</HI> Hermit, who lived in a Cave on the <HI>Blaw Peper-bergh,</HI> came to <HI>Batavia</HI> to &s;peak with the General; and refu&s;ing to deliver his Me&s;&s;age to any of his Attendants, he was ad|mitted and brought before the General, with whom he &s;pent &s;ome time alone. His Bu&s;ine&s;s with him, was to make a di&s;covery of a Plot, which &s;everal <HI>Javians</HI> had laid to &s;urprize the City of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and to put all the Dutch Garri&s;on to the Sword: Upon which the General di&s;patch'd an Expre&s;s to the Governor of <HI>Bantam,</HI> to Command him to be upon his Guard, and to let him know that he &s;hould have a Reinforcement &s;ent him &s;peedily by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>The Company upon this conceived a great Su&s;|picion, that the young King might be in this Con|&s;piracy; But it was upon a clo&s;e Enquiry, found to be a meer &s;urmize; and all his Actions &s;hewing &s;o much the contrary all along, they continued to treat him with the &s;ame Re&s;pect as before: For all the Ring-leaders of this Plot were detected, taken, and puni&s;hed according to their De&s;erts; but not the lea&s;t thing could be found that might any way reflect on the young King.</P>
<P>The Hermit did not Care to return to his Cot|tage again: So the Company promi&s;ed him, that he &s;hould never want if he would continue with them; which he accepted of readily.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="109">
He &s;pake &s;even Languages; to wit, <HI>Turki&s;h, Ara|bic, Per&s;ian, Moori&s;h, Chine&s;e, Malei&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Javian;</HI> and had Travell'd over mo&s;t parts of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>A|frica.</HI> He had lived 15 years in that Cell; and it was a wonder how a Man &s;hould continue there &s;o long with any thing of &s;afety; con&s;idering the ma|ny Tygers, Leopards, Serpents, and other devour|ing Creatures that are in great numbers all about that Mountain.</P>
<P>His Dre&s;s was very much like that of the <HI>Arme|nian</HI> Women; &s;o that one would not have taken him for a Man; and be&s;ides that, one might have mi&s;taken him, even tho' one was near him, becau&s;e he had pull'd his Beard out by the Roots: He was very thoughtful, &s;pake but &s;eldom, and very grave|ly. He had above twenty pair of Shooes made of Pa&s;tboard, hung about his Girdle. In&s;tead of a Hat, he had a &s;ort of a Turbant wrapt about his Head made of &s;trip'd Cotton, about twelve Ells long, as the Moors u&s;ually wear.</P>
<P>As to his Diet, he Eat moderately, but loved to have all very good. Whatever he Drank, he poured part of it upon his Head, which was as bare as the Palm of a Man's Head, which was as bare as the Palm of a Man's Hand. The Lodging that was ap|pointed for him was over again&s;t mine, &s;o that I had &s;ome Conver&s;ation with him in the <HI>Malei&s;h</HI> Language. But he was not free of his Di&s;cour&s;e, except &s;ometimes in the Relation of his Voyages, and the De&s;cription of the Countries he had &s;een; as to the re&s;t he &s;eemed re&s;erved. I ask'd him one day, how he came to be an Hermit; to which he replied, ju&s;t as you come to be a Surgeon. But to have done with my capricious Gentleman.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent for to one of the General's Servants, &s;o that I had once more an opportunity of &s;eeing the General's Garden, which was one of the fine&s;t that ever was &s;een; for all kind of A&s;iatic or In|dian Trees and Flowers, in which were two Parts
<PB N="197" REF="109">
&s;et a&s;ide, the one for all manner of Wild-Bea&s;ts; the other for all &s;orts of Birds, of all which, an ac|count would be too tedious: In &s;hort, I can hardly think of any rare Creature that was not there to be &s;een.</P>
<P>Two days after this, my Companion and I, and two more, went a &s;hooting, about two or three Leagues into the Country, along by the Powder-Mills, upon the River <HI>Jacatra:</HI> And as we had pretty good &s;port, and kill'd a good quantity of Pigeons, Rabbets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> we were going to a <HI>Negery</HI> to refre&s;h our &s;elves, and make Merry with our Pro|vi&s;ions, we &s;pying a Rabbet making towards a little Wood; two of us went after him, while the others went forward to get that Dre&s;s'd which we had kill'd. As we were in pur&s;uit of our Game, my Friend one way, and I the other, I came to a nar|row River's &s;ide, where I &s;aw a Man &s;itting in a Melancholly po&s;ture, with his Eyes on the Ground. Hearing him groan and &s;igh, put me to a &s;tand, and ask him what he was; to which he an&s;wer'd me with a deep &s;igh, that he was a poor Hollander. I askt him what he did there, and whither he de|&s;ign'd to go. Ah! Sir, &s;ays he, I know not where I am, nor which way I am to take, but &s;urely Pro|vidence hath &s;ent you to my Relief; and &s;eeing I have the Happine&s;s once more to meet with a Chri&s;tian, I be&s;eech you to direct me, (if there's any way for't) how I may come to you: Saying this, he fell upon his Knees; &s;o I told him, I would get him over, and bid him &s;tay there. My Com|panion had made his &s;hoot, and was gone to the re&s;t: So I went up to the Village, and got a Praw, which I &s;ent to bring him over to me; and as &s;oon as he came over, he gu&s;ht out in Tears, and Embracing me, thank'd me mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately for my &s;ea&s;onable A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I de&s;ired him to go along with me to &s;ome Company I had, which he did;
<PB N="198" REF="110">
and gave me a &s;hort account of him&s;elf by the way. My Company wondred who I had got with me, but when they were informed what he was, we all help'd to Comfort him, and treated him as we did our &s;elves. In that while he inform'd us of the par|ticulars of his Misfortunes: The &s;um of which was, That being come over from <HI>Del&s;t,</HI> in the Company's Service, as Carpenter, he had been employed in the <HI>Kartirian</HI> Wars; and as he, with three more, were &s;ent out to take a View of &s;ome part of the chief City of that Kingdom, they had the ill Fortune to fall into the Hands of the Enemy, who carried them away Pri&s;oners to <HI>Tuban,</HI> and there Sold them to a rich <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who was ju&s;t come thither in a Ship of his own: That <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> carried them all four to <HI>China,</HI> to the Sea-Port Town call'd <HI>Quancheu;</HI> where after &s;even years of hard Slavery, they found an opportunity, and made their e&s;cape from thence in a &s;mall Boat to the I&s;land of <HI>Manilha;</HI> where they luckily met with a Ship that was coming to <HI>Batavia,</HI> but as they were got almo&s;t within reach of it, and within four miles of Land, their Ship &s;truck upon a Shelf, and there &s;unk; and he knew of none that had &s;aved them&s;elves but he alone. The Relation of this di&s;mal Story did affect us &s;o, that we were as Melancholly as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Our Dinner being over, we return'd to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and took this poor Man with us, and pre&s;ented him to the General, who appointed him a Po&s;t under the Gunner of the Ca&s;tle, till further Orders.</P>
<P>I need not give the Reader the particular Ac|count which he gave us of his Slavery, it being much the &s;ame with what we u&s;e to hear concerning that Condition, and may be found in mo&s;t Books of Travels, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of <HI>Ferdinandus Men|dez Pinto,</HI> who gives an Experimental Account of all &s;orts of Slavery, having been him&s;elf, taken 13 times, and 17 times &s;old, in the &s;pace of 21 years.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="110">
About this time three Ships were getting ready, to go and make a di&s;covery of a certain I&s;land which lies Northward of <HI>Japan.</HI> There had been &s;ome Ships &s;ent thither &s;ome years before, but they had all mi&s;carried; &s;ome by the way; others (as it was reported) by the attractive power of the Mag|netic Mountains were drawn violently to Shore; &s;o that to avoid that danger, they contrived the Building of the&s;e Ships, without Nails or Iron Work. When they were ready, they Beat up for Volun|teer Seamen, promi&s;ing them for an Encourage|ment a Twelve Month's Pay over and above their Wages; half of it to be paid pre&s;ently, the other half when they came back. This rai&s;ed Men in abundance, and as fa&s;t as they could wi&s;h; and in three weeks time, the Ships being ready, went un|der &s;ail with 220 Men on Board of 'em.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that I&s;land was fir&s;t found out by the Portugue&s;es, but that they were forced to abandon it by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Cold and multitude of Wild-Bea&s;ts; for it lies Northward of <HI>Tartary.</HI> But the Gold, which as it is reported, comes in great &s;tore down &s;everal Rivers of that Country, was (I pre&s;ume) the only Motive which &s;et the Dutch upon making the&s;e dangerous Attempts, and upon ventring a &s;econd time, after &s;uch bad Succe&s;s. What became of this la&s;t Expedition I never heard; for there came no News of it to <HI>Batavia</HI> before I came away from thence.</P>
<P>Soon after this, a great piece of Roguery was carried on at <HI>Bantam,</HI> which unhappily proved &s;ucce&s;sful. The Dutch had there under one of the Ba&s;tions, a great Magazine of Powder, and they had unfortunately at that time above 100 Tun of it in the Magazine. A Javian undertook to get in by breaking of the Wall, which he was forced to do by digging a way under Ground quite to the &s;ide of it. Every day he clo&s;ed up the entrance
<PB N="200" REF="111">
into his Hole with Earth, &s;o artificially and &s;o &s;oft|ly, that no body perceived it, and that neither of the two Sentinels that &s;tood on the Ba&s;tion heard the lea&s;t Noi&s;e at any time. When he was got in, he took a Bamboo-Cane that was hollow, and fil|ling that with Gun-powder, lighted it at one end, and the Fire coming to the Powder in the Cane, gave a great Blow, with &s;ome Flame, without doing any further harm for the pre&s;ent. This alarm'd all the People, who pre&s;ently went to &s;earch every corner of the Ba&s;tion, to &s;ee what the matter was, and there the Bamboo-Cane was found, and the Powder that was in it was con&s;umed: But no &s;ooner had they open'd the Vault-Door, but the Wind finding a free pa&s;&s;age, took &s;ome &s;parks of Fire a|long with it, which lighted among the Powder, and in an in&s;tant &s;et that on Fire, and blew up the whole Ba&s;tion with 16 pieces of Cannon, and above 200 Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>An Account of this Accident was quickly &s;ent to the General at <HI>Batavia,</HI> who pre&s;ently &s;ent Men thither; together with Orders to the Governor, and to the young King, to make a diligent En|quiry after the Author's of this Villany: And in a &s;hort time, three Javians were di&s;covered to be the Men; who were brought bound to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and con|fe&s;s'd, That they were the only Contrivers of that Action; upon which they were all three Condemned to Die. He that had &s;et Fire to the Cane, was brought upon a Scaffold erected for that purpo&s;e, and there Pinch'd with red-hot Tongs from the morning till towards the evening, at which time he was cut into Quarters; &s;o that that day was &s;pent in Torturing of that Fellow only. The next day the &s;econd was &s;erved in like manner; The third was Broke upon the Wheel.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="111">
We thought the time long now 'ere the Ships went off to <HI>Holland,</HI> or at lea&s;t till the time was fixt for their going; which we expected daily &s;hould be done: However, we had got our Names upon the Roll, and having time enough, we ven|tured to take a &s;mall Journey together to vi&s;it the Hermits Cells; for which purpo&s;e we took &s;ome Javian Guides with us. The Road, we found as it was told us, very commodious, having a great many Inns, and good Accommodation, till we came to the Wilderne&s;s where the&s;e Hermits dwell. Within &s;ix or &s;even miles of which, we came to two Villages, one on one &s;ide, the other on the other &s;ide of the River; in the middle of which was a very high Rock, upon which was a <HI>Javian</HI> Temple. We went to &s;ee it, and found there only one Reverend Bard, who re&s;ided there all the Year round. That Temple was u&s;ed only two days in the Year, <HI>viz.</HI> Their <HI>New-Year's Day,</HI> and the Fea&s;t of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who&s;e Sect they follow: And on tho&s;e Days, there is much Praying and Wor&s;hiping, and great Proce&s;&s;ions made.</P>
<P>Having taken a View of this, we went on, and came to a Village that is near the <HI>Blawen Pepper-bergh,</HI> from which we had not above 2 or 3 miles to the place where the Cells are. In that Village we &s;taid the latter part of that Day, and all that Night, in order to &s;pend all the next day in &s;a|tisfying our Curio&s;ity; and accordingly we got thi|ther early the next morning. There we &s;aw a great many pretty Caves, cut out of the Natural Rocks, and very Artificially contrived. We had been told, that they were poor little mi&s;erable Holes that were not worth the &s;eeing; but we were not a little &s;urprized to find them &s;o neat and de|lightful, nor le&s;s plea&s;ed to &s;ee how &s;ucce&s;sfully they had imitated Nature; in&s;omuch, that it was hard to judge, whether Nature or Art had had the
<PB N="202" REF="112">
chiefe&s;t hand in the ordering of 'em. The&s;e Cells were mo&s;t inhabited by a &s;ort of Men, who in imitation of their Founder, Devote them&s;elves to a perpetual Au&s;terity, Mortification, and Self-Denial, as he him&s;elf had &s;et them an Example; a&s;&s;uring them, That the Cha&s;tizing of the Body, would conduce very much to Felicity, and would infallibly draw down God's Ble&s;&s;ing upon them; &s;o that he was look'd upon as a great Saint; and his Followers are valued at no le&s;s rate all over that Country.</P>
<P>They wore long Gowns after the manner of the <HI>Armenian</HI> Prie&s;ts, or the <HI>Bonzen</HI> in <HI>Japan.</HI> They &s;pend all Day and Night in lifting up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven, intimating, That they De&s;ire nothing here below. The Javians that were our Guides, told us, That they u&s;ed to Eat nothing but Boil'd Herbs, Beans, Roots, and &s;uch like Fruits: And that on &s;ome Days, which they call their Fea&s;t-Days, they eat Flies, Mice, Scorpions, and Spiders, dre&s;t with a Juice pre&s;t out of a cer|tain Herb that grows there in abundance, which looks very much like our Sorrel. In this poor Condition they live and die; but in the highe&s;t E&s;teem and Veneration among all the Javians: So that they never fail to be Canonized after their Death, and their Bodies are burnt with great Solemnity, and with all the re&s;pect imagi|nable; every one thinking him&s;elf happy, that can but come and throw in a Bundle of Sweet-Herbs upon the Corps.</P>
<P>Some of tho&s;e Hermits, thinking that the more they morti&s;ie the more they are acceptable to their God, Eat nothing but green Herbs and Roots, and that very &s;paringly; which makes them look &s;o na&s;tily, that it frightens one to look upon them, and kills them quickly too.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="112">
When we had &s;een all we could &s;ee, we came away time enough to reach the two Villages again before Night; where we &s;taid that night; and the next morning we &s;et out early, to get into <HI>Batavia</HI> as &s;oon as we could; becau&s;e we had a mind to &s;hare in the Rejoycing that was to be that day, it being the General's Birth-Day; wherefore we took a Praw, &s;eeing the Wind and Tide was for us, and with a very quick pa&s;&s;age down the River, came to <HI>Batavia</HI> ju&s;t as the People began to move. All the Burghers and Freemen were in Arms, and drew up before the General's Lodgings in the Ca&s;tle, where after the Di&s;charge of all the Cannon about the Ca&s;tle and City, they &s;aluted his Excellency with &s;everal Vollies of Shot. Each Nation then came in a di&s;tinct Body with Pre&s;ents to the Gene|ral; as fir&s;t, the <HI>Chine&s;es, Siamers, Japonne&s;es, Ma|ca&s;&s;ars, Amboine&s;es, Bandane&s;es,</HI> &amp;c. and even the <HI>Javians,</HI> who are not permitted to &s;et a foot in the Ca&s;tle on any other time, were then let in; but all the&s;e come but after the Company of Burghers and Freemen, which is compo&s;ed of Dutch, Ger|mans, Engli&s;h, Danes, French, Portugue&s;e, and other Chri&s;tians, born in the <HI>Indies,</HI> who altogether make one Body. The&s;e Pre&s;ents are Magni&s;icent, and one may judge they mu&s;t needs be very con&s;ide|rable, when the very Soldiers who &s;tood to their Arms under the Ca&s;tle-Gate, had &s;ome Hundreds of Guildens given them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, all the Streets were full of Lights, Bone&s;ires, and Fireworks; wherein the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> em|ployed their utmo&s;t Art and Skill: And for three or four days there was nothing but Fea&s;ting and Treating one another.</P>
<P>The time now being come that the Fleet was to go to <HI>Holland,</HI> and the day fixt, <HI>viz.</HI> the 12th of <HI>February,</HI> (in ca&s;e the Weather &s;hould permit it) my Friend and I made our Applications to be or|dered
<PB N="204" REF="113">
on Board of one Ship, if it might be thought convenient: And according to our Reque&s;t, we were a&s;&s;ign'd on Board the Ship called the <HI>Ex-change;</HI> which did not as yet lie before <HI>Batavia,</HI> but was re&s;itting in the I&s;land <HI>Onru&s;t,</HI> and was ordered to get-ready to go Commadore of this Fleet, as &s;he was to have gone with the la&s;t Fleet which went on the 22d of <HI>November</HI> 1684. but that &s;he was di&s;abled. Thus we had time enough to make Pro|vi&s;ion for our Voyage.</P>
<P>The Ships being come into the Road before <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> &s;ome days were appointed to Addre&s;s our Prayers in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner to the Al|mighty for his Protection, and to Beg of him that he would pre&s;erve us from all Dangers; which was Religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved in the Dutch and Malei&s;h Churches.</P>
<P>After this, the General gave Order that the Li&s;t of tho&s;e who had &s;erved out their time, &s;hould be called over; and publick notice of it being given by the Clerk of the Mu&s;ters, tho&s;e who were to go, appeared all with their Arms in good Order, and by Beat of Drum were led into the Ca&s;tle, where they deliver'd their Arms into the Hands of the Armourer: Upon which every Man of 'em was pre&s;ented with four Rixdollers, as a Gratuity over and above each Man his Half-year's Pay. Tho&s;e that wanted more Money, and de&s;ired to have it might be furni&s;ht with it, &s;o it was le&s;s or not more than what the Company owed them, abating or allowing 20 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and giving an Acquittance of his Money &s;o received aforehand, made and &s;igned before a Notary Publick.</P>

<P>I Had made Provi&s;ions of all things nece&s;&s;ary for my Voyage, but e&s;pecially of pre&s;erved Pepper, Arack, and Tobacco, which are the chief Things for &s;uch a long Voyage as that is.

He gave me a Seal-Ring and a Letter, de&s;iring me to deliver them to his Wife at <HI>&V;lm,</HI> in ca&s;e I got &s;afe thither; &s;o we parted with Tears in our Eyes all three of us. He conducted us two to the <HI>Vier|kant</HI> or Square, from whence we took a Praw, and went on Board the <HI>Exchange;</HI> where a Review was made the next day, to &s;ee if there were no body
<PB N="206" REF="114">
wanting. All being found there, Orders came the next day, that we &s;hould weigh Anchor, and go a Quarter of a League into Sea, and there ca&s;t An|chor again.</P>
<P>Then was there again a Day appointed to Im|plore the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty; which was du|ly ob&s;erved, both at Land, and on Board our Ships. Then the Ma&s;ters of the Ships and the Factors were invited a Shore to take their Farewel Dinner with the General, and to receive his Orders for Sailing, and to take their Oaths of Fidelity: After which, they repaired every one to their &s;everal Ships, with Orders to &s;et Sail with the fir&s;t fair Wind; but the Wind was &s;o changeable for three or four days, that it made us weigh our Anchors, and drop them again four or five times. Some of our more debauch'd Seamen, and others, did &s;o fret and fume at the&s;e frequent Di&s;appointments, and grew &s;o very impatient, that they could not forbear vent|ing their Rage in very undecent and prophane Ex|pre&s;&s;ions; for which, the Ma&s;ter, a good old Man of near 90 years of Age, reproved them very &s;harply, and threatned them &s;everely if they did not refrain from &s;uch Words; telling them, that this was not the way to obtain their De&s;ires, but that they ought rather to Pray to God to &s;end us a favourable Wind, and patiently wait his Will and Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>About 12 of the Clock, in the 5th Night, the Wind came good for us; whereupon, our Ma&s;ter as Commadore, ordered a Gun to be fired as a &s;ig|nal for the two other Ships to weigh Anchor with us. So we all went under Sail together, for in the Voyages homeward, the Ships are always obliged to go together; and tho' the one may be a quicker Sailer than the other, yet &s;he mu&s;t not run away before the re&s;t; but &s;he is forced to Furl &s;ome of her Sails, &s;o as the &s;lowe&s;t of 'em may keep pace
<PB N="207" REF="114">
with her; and nothing excu&s;es their parting from each other but a Storm, or hard Weather; after which they are to rejoyn as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The next day we came and Anchor'd before <HI>Bantam,</HI> about a League from Shore near the place where we lay when we went in pur&s;uit of the Py|rates. Our Boat went on Shore, and I went with it, to &s;ee &s;ome of my Acquaintance there, and to take my leave of them. Notwith&s;tanding that the Steward had given me very &s;trict charge not to &s;tay, and told me two or three times he was ju&s;t going, I could not part from my Friends readily, and when I came to go, I found my Spark gone; and was told he was gone off half an Hour before, with eight Cows, and other Provi&s;ions that he was come for. When I heard this, I was ready to die with Fear and Grief; and had no other Remedy, but immediately to Hire a light Praw with 16 Oars; When we came out of the River of <HI>Bantam</HI> into Sea, we &s;aw our Ships ju&s;t ready to Sail; for the Wind was very good, and then they loo&s;e no time: However, I pluckt up a good Heart when I &s;aw 'em, and encouraged the Javians to pull &s;toutly, and promi&s;ed them &s;ix Rixdollers among&s;t 'em over and above the Bargain, in ca&s;e they overtook our Ship. This made them Row like Tygers, and by that time it was Night, as the Ship was got up to the I&s;land <HI>Dwars in the Zee,</HI> we came in reach of her, at which the Javians &s;et up a full <HI>Huzza,</HI> and I was &s;o tran&s;ported with Joy, that I could not but joyn with them very heartily. As &s;oon as we could come to fa&s;ten by her &s;ide, I went to get up; but unfortunately made a fal&s;e &s;tep, and tumbled down again into the Boat, and &s;o Sprain'd my Leg, that I was forced to be drawn up into the Ship, and lie &s;till for &s;ome days.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="115">
The next day, three of the Cows were kill'd and di&s;tributed among the Ship's Crew. Some days af|ter we pa&s;&s;ed the Streights of <HI>Sunda,</HI> and came to the <HI>Prince's I&s;land,</HI> where we parted with our Convoy Ships, and &s;ent them back to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>As we came by the <HI>Prince's</HI> I&s;land, which lies at the furthe&s;t corner of <HI>Great Java,</HI> we came into open Sea, and the Wind being right good for us, we continued our Cour&s;e forward, not being wil|ling to loo&s;e &s;o fair a Wind as we had then; &s;o that we did not put in there, nor would we &s;tay to &s;end in our Boats for a Recruit of fre&s;h Water, as it is Cu&s;tomary; but made the be&s;t of our way, and fired three Guns to wi&s;h each other a good Voy|age.</P>
<P>We &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e now directly towards Cape <HI>de Bon E&s;perance,</HI> Hall'd in our Long-Boat and Shallop, and took in our Anchors, and fitted our &s;elves for the Voyage.</P>
<P>When we were got out of &s;ight of <HI>Great Java,</HI> a &s;econd Review was made of all our Ship's Crew, which amounted to Eighty eight Per&s;ons in all, <HI>viz.</HI> the Ma&s;ter, the Upper Steer&s;man, two Under Steer&s;|men, and two Mates, to relieve them from Duty; two Quarter-Ma&s;ters, to Order the Watches, which I have given an Account of in the beginning of this Book; a Factor; a Book-keeper; and a Clerk or A&s;&s;i&s;tant; An Upper Chirurgion, (my &s;elf) and an Under Ma&s;ter-Chirurgion; a Steward, who di|&s;tributed the Allowances of Meat and Drink to every Per&s;on according to the Ma&s;ter's Orders; a Cook and a Scullion; a Gunner with four Men and Boys, who were likewi&s;e to help the Steward; a Serjeant; two Ma&s;ter Carpenters, and three Mates, a Boat&s;wain, and his Boy, a Schieman and his Boy; a Provo&s;t; four Boys; the eight Soldiers, and 32 Mariners; We had no Chaplain, but we had Prayers duly Read by the Book-keeper: There was ano|ther
<PB N="209" REF="115">
Ma&s;ter of a Ship, and a Ma&s;ter Chirurgion; but neither of them had any Po&s;t in our Ship, they were only Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>We came &s;afe with all the&s;e People, till we got pa&s;t the I&s;land, called St. <HI>Paul</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam:</HI> After which our greate&s;t concern was, to pa&s;s &s;afe through the Latitude of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> or St. <HI>Maurice;</HI> which, as I have already told you, is very &s;ubject to dread|ful Storms and Hurricanes, mo&s;t Sea&s;ons of the year; in&s;omuch, that more Ships are lo&s;t there|abouts, than any where again.</P>
<P>Having e&s;caped this place likewi&s;e, tho' we met with hard weather, we came at la&s;t, after nine weeks Sail, in &s;ight of the great Promontory of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> which rejoyced us much. One of the Carpenter's Men had the good fortune to &s;py Land the fir&s;t of any; for which good Tydings, the Ma&s;ter pre&s;ented him with two Ducatoons and a Quart of Canary, as it was ever the Cu&s;tom on Board our Ships, to gratifie tho&s;e that fir&s;t di&s;cover Land. We immediately loo&s;ned our Anchors, and fa&s;ten'd them to their Cables, and made directly towards <HI>Tafel-Bay,</HI> which lay about 20 miles from us. The next day we were within two Leagues of it, it being a very great Snow, and the Weather being very Calm, which was very extraordinary, it being for the mo&s;t part very Blu&s;tring there all the year round. We hall'd out our Boat, and Long-Boat, into which having &s;ent &s;ome of our Men with Oars, they hall'd our Ship into the Haven. This took up half a day, and when we were come to a place where we could ca&s;t Anchor, we did &s;o; and hoi&s;ted up our Flags, after which they at Land did the &s;ame likewi&s;e up|on the Tower of the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Then our Ma&s;ter went to Shore, and gave the Governor of the place an account of our Succe&s;s thus far on our Voyage. Here we found three
<PB N="210" REF="116">
Ships from <HI>Holland,</HI> and one Engli&s;h Fly-boat, riding at Anchor. We were immediately &s;upplied with &s;ome Sheep, Fruits, and Herbs, which were very welcome Refre&s;hments, and many <HI>Hottentots</HI> came on Board of us; &s;ome of which, our Men made &s;e|veral little Pre&s;ents to. Our Men were likewi&s;e permitted to go on Shore by turns, to refre&s;h them|&s;elves: Some of our Crew were &s;ent on purpo&s;e, that they might go into the Wood to fetch &s;ome Fuel, and others were &s;ent for a Recruit of fre&s;h Water.</P>
<P>When I went a&s;hore, I found the place extraor|dinary full of People, but mo&s;tly of tho&s;e Soldiers, which belong'd to the Dutch Ships that lay there. They were brave lu&s;ty Men, and very brisk, ha|ving met with nothing but good Succe&s;s in their Voyage thither. Some of their Men were Sick, and carried into the Ho&s;pital, which was pretty full. I went to &s;ee it, and told near 200 of them there; mo&s;t of which were forced to be left be|hind, not being recover'd before the Fleet was ob|liged to go on, on their Voyage. The&s;e Ships be|ing gone off, the Town was left as thin as might be, and every thing was as cheap again; &s;o that we had more conveniency of making our &s;elves Merry. I &s;pent here &s;ome time very plea&s;antly, my Landlord being a very hone&s;t Fellow, and ex|traordinary obliging. He was of <HI>Newrenberg,</HI> and by Employment a Brewer. He having &s;ome Know|ledge of me before this, &s;eem'd daily to increa&s;e his good Opinion and E&s;teem for me; and his Daughter, I ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, to become every day more and more obliging, which I look'd upon as a de&s;ign between them of &s;taying me there: But I was &s;o heartily &s;et upon my Return home, that I might once again Enjoy the free Liberty of my Religion, that I could not be gain'd upon to al|ter my Mind upon any kind of Con&s;ideration what|ever.
<PB N="211" REF="116">
A few days after, I found, that what I had &s;urmiz'd was true enough; and the Father very kindly made me an Offer of his Daughter, and told me what he was ready to do for me if I would &s;tay there; and withal, that he had a great Incli|nation to go into his own Country, which he was loath to do, unle&s;s he could by &s;uch a means as this, make over his Lands to his Daughter, and put her into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them: For a Freeman cannot otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of what he hath; and if he is de&s;irous to leave the Country, he cannot Sell his E&s;tate, but it mu&s;t fall of Cour&s;e to the Company; &s;o that he can take nothing over with him but his Per&s;onal E&s;tate. But neither the Daughter's Beauty, nor the Sweetne&s;s of his Ha|bitation, could have &s;uch an Influence upon me as to make me break my Re&s;olution. So that with|out hearkening to him any further than ju&s;t to thank him, I made all nece&s;&s;ary Preparation, and made me ready to go back to my Ship. But I wonder'd that my Landlord could ever have the Heart to part from &s;o plea&s;ant a place as his was to return home, &s;eeing he had that only thing which I wanted, the opportunity of Exerci&s;ing my Reli|gion publickly.</P>
<P>One day I went out by my &s;elf to fetch a walk, and as I went mu&s;ing along, I found my &s;elf before I was aware of it, within a quarter of a Mile of the <HI>Lewen-bergh,</HI> between which and the Sea, I &s;aw &s;ome of tho&s;e Hutts which the <HI>Hottentots</HI> dwell in. Upon &s;ight of which, my Curio&s;ity led me to go and &s;ee what kind of life tho&s;e People led. I went into one of 'em, and there I &s;aw a parcel of 'em lying upon the Ground like &s;o many Hogs, and fa&s;t a&s;leep: But as &s;oon as they awaked and &s;aw me, they &s;prung up and came up to me, making a noi&s;e like Turkies. I was not a little concerned; yet &s;eeing they d<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d not go about to
<PB N="212" REF="117">
do me any harm, I pull'd out a piece of Tobacco and gave it them: They were mightily plea&s;ed with that Pre&s;ent, but the way they took to &s;hew their Gratitude, and to thank me, was &s;o odious to me, that I wi&s;h'd I had not given them any oc|ca&s;ion of returning me Thanks. For no &s;ooner had I given them this, but they all lifted up tho&s;e Flaps of Sheep-Skin which hang before their Privy-Parts to give me a &s;ight of 'em. What with this bea&s;tly Behaviour, and what with the na&s;ty &s;tench of their Kennels, (as I think I may properly call 'em) I made all ha&s;te to be gone. Some of 'em I found at their Dinner, or rather, Eating, (for that is a word of too much Order and Decency for them.) They had only a piece of Cow-Hide, laid out upon the Coals a Broyling, and to make the Carbonnade more plea&s;ant, they had &s;queezed the Dung out of the Guts, and &s;pread it finely on the Hide to moi&s;ten it, and to give it a reli&s;h; and this they take when it is broyl'd, and chop it, and &s;o Eat it. The very ordering of it in this manner, turn'd my Sto|mach &s;o, that I could not &s;tay to &s;ee the Eating of it: But I made all the ha&s;te I could to be gone. I went from thence directly to the <HI>Lewen-bergh,</HI> which is a fine plea&s;ant Hill, not at all Rocky, but cover'd over with Gra&s;s, and affording a mo&s;t plea|&s;ant Pro&s;pect. Here I &s;at me down, and took a view of the Country all round me. After I had been there a while, I e&s;pied at Sea a Ship making to the Port with full Sails; and pre&s;ently after I &s;aw the Flag hoi&s;ted up in the Ca&s;tle. Upon this I came down to go towards the Fort, and as I was going along the Shore, there &s;tood a Servant Maid, who was come to fill a little Tub with Sand: As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me, &s;he cry'd out to me as loud as &s;he could, <HI>Maridi &s;ini Senior:</HI> Oh Sir! Pray come and helpme. I ran full &s;peed towards her to help her, and when I came up to her, &s;he &s;hewed me a
<PB N="213" REF="117">
dreadful long Serpent, that had ju&s;t then been de|vouring a young <HI>Hottentot,</HI> and had &s;wallowed him all up but the Legs, which &s;till &s;tuck out of his Mouth. This had put the Maid into a great Con|&s;ternation, and made her afraid that &s;he &s;hould be his next Prey: And truly being much in the &s;ame Apprehen&s;ions my &s;elf, I betook my &s;elf to my Heels, which the Maid &s;eeing, &s;he gave a dreadful Shriek, and began to run too. That great Shriek &s;he gave brought out &s;ome <HI>Hottentots</HI> that were there|abouts, who came running towards us. As &s;oon as they &s;aw what was the matter, they got them|&s;elves ready to catch the Serpent; and having brought out &s;ome long Ropes, they threw them with wonderful Dexterity about its middle, and drawing the Ropes, &s;ome at one end, &s;ome at ano|ther, as hard as they were able; they held him &s;o fa&s;t, that I expected they would have cut him in two. All the while the Serpent Hi&s;s'd in a fear|ful manner, and Twi&s;ted it &s;elf &s;trangely, but could not &s;lip away. At la&s;t came &s;ome of the Men with great Poles, with which they knock'd him on the Head. This dreadful Creature was very near 16 Foot long. They fa&s;tned it to a Stick, and let it dry.</P>
<P>This being done, I return'd to the place from whence I came.</P>
<P>In my return I met with &s;ome Wild <HI>Hottentots,</HI> who come down thither from the <HI>Cafre</HI>'s Country, about 100 Leagues from thence. They, as I ob|&s;erved, are almo&s;t Blind in the day time, at lea&s;t extream Dim-&s;ighted; &s;o that they do mo&s;t of their Bu&s;ine&s;s by Night. In the time that I &s;taid in the Cape, I &s;aw once one of the&s;e Wild Prople exe|cuted for Theft: He had &s;ome time before &s;tolen &s;ome Cows and Sheep from &s;ome of the Freemen, without the Approbation of their King, (which is a Dignity they confer upon &s;ome one among&s;t 'em;
<PB N="214" REF="118">
and whereever they are, tho' but to the number of five or &s;ix together, they always make them a King or Captain to Rule over them, without who&s;e Con&s;ent no kind of thing is to be done; and in this the Company doth not at all interpo&s;e, but leaves them to their own Cu&s;toms). The Crimi|nal was tied Hand and Foot, and &s;tretched out be|twixt two Po&s;ts, about half a Man's height from the Ground; after which &s;ome Men came with great Sticks, and beat him to Death. If they hit him on the Head or Brea&s;t he is &s;oon di&s;patcht; but they never give over as long as they find any Breath in him. When he is expired, they carry him to the Wood, and there fa&s;ten him to a Bough, and leave him for a Prey to Wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Ship that I e&s;pied coming from the top of the Hill, was an Engli&s;h Fly-boat, which came and ca&s;t Anchor by the other Engli&s;h Ship that lay there before. The Ma&s;ter gave us an Account of his Voyage, which had been thus far very pro|&s;perous. He was bound for <HI>Jappan,</HI> but was to call at &s;everal Places by the way. He put in here to Treat with the Governour, but about what, I could not be informed.</P>
<P>After we had &s;taid herefull three Weeks, which is more by a Week than Ships generally do, every body was ordered on Board in a readine&s;s to be going. Our Ma&s;ter being Commadore, call'd a Council to &s;ettle the Orders of their Voyage. The next day a Review was made, where all were found in very good Order, except two that were very &s;ick; but yet, as ill as they were, they would not &s;tay there, but would venture on their Voyage.</P>
<P>The next day, after the Review was made, our Ma&s;ter and Factor, together with the other Ma&s;ters of Ships, went once more a Shore to wait on the
<PB N="215" REF="118">
Governor to take their Leave of him; They came back that &s;ame night in order to go out of the Bay with the fir&s;t fair Wind; which happen'd that very night, being the 23th of <HI>May;</HI> and then we &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e North-We&s;t.</P>
<P>All the next day we had the African Coa&s;ts in &s;ight. Our Water Ve&s;&s;els were &s;hut up again, and dealt out by Portions; which was, a Can to each Per&s;on once in 24 hours; and half a Quartern of Brandy, or Arack. When we had been a while under Sail, out came a Seaman from under the Hatches, who had hid him&s;elf there till we were got out in full Sea. He was but ju&s;t come to the Cape with an Engli&s;h Ship; and being &s;ent a&s;hore to fetch in fre&s;h Water, he &s;o contrived his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s as to get in with our Men, being re&s;olved ne|ver to go with the Engli&s;h again. He was an Ham|burgher, a brisk active Fellow: In the harde&s;t of Weather, he was fir&s;t and la&s;t on the Ma&s;t, and extreamly &s;erviceable. So that he got the love of every body, and generally had a larger &s;hare of the Di&s;tributions than any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Having now &s;ailed about 10 days, we came up to St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> where the Ships that are homeward bound from <HI>India</HI> &s;eldom fail to call; but our Ma&s;ter did not think fit to put in there, partly becau&s;e we had already made great &s;tays, and partly becau&s;e we needed no Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>In 14 days we found our &s;elves under the Line, and the Sun &s;tood Perpendicular over our Heads. This was the twelfth time that I pa&s;&s;ed under it in my Voyages to and fro. As &s;oon as we came there, our Ma&s;ter commanded a White Flag to be hung out; which was the u&s;ual Token for all the Ma&s;ters and Steer&s;men in the Fleet to come on Board of him. When they were all come together, he open'd their In&s;tructions to them, which were, That contrary to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> homeward
<PB N="216" REF="119">
bound Ships, (which was to Steer their Cour&s;e betwixt <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Hitland,</HI> in their return to <HI>Holland)</HI> they &s;hould now go round <HI>Hitland,</HI> and pa&s;s betwixt <HI>Fero</HI> and <HI>Filo,</HI> and &s;o keep along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Norway,</HI> where they &s;hould meet with a Squadron of Men of War for their Convoy. And this was accordingly done. But now being our Voyage was made &s;o much the longer by the&s;e Or|ders than otherwi&s;e it would have been, they be|gan to &s;horten each Man's Allowance to make it hold out the better.</P>
<P>All this while we got, (Ble&s;&s;ed be God) all &s;afe from under the Line, and were not above &s;even days a pa&s;&s;ing of it. Whereas it is common for Ships to lie there two or three Months, and cannot &s;tir for want of a Wind, &s;o that what with the Calm, and the exce&s;&s;ive Heat, they loo&s;e abundance of their Men: But we had but five Men &s;ick all that time.</P>
<P>From thence we pa&s;s'd to the <HI>Gras-Zee,</HI> or <HI>Gra&s;s-Sea,</HI> &s;o called from the Gra&s;s which grows there, &s;o that the Sea appears ju&s;t like a Meadow, and it lookt to us as if we were already with one Foot upon Land. This held for near 100 Leagues toge|ther. We pa&s;s'd through it with a very good Wind, and were very glad to get out of it, not|with&s;tanding it was a pretty Sight enough. When we pull'd up any of that Gra&s;s, we found it had ve|ry long &s;mall Roots.</P>
<P>Soon after this we came in &s;ight of the I&s;lands <HI>Corvo</HI> and <HI>Flores,</HI> and at the &s;ame time of the <HI>North-Star.</HI> Being got thus far, each Seaman's Allow|ance began to increa&s;e again. But before this Order was given, the Ma&s;ter &s;ent to Examine all the Provi&s;ions, and had an Account brought him of what quantity there was left of each particular. He finding there was good &s;tore of Arack left, and that we had had a very quick Pa&s;&s;age &s;o far, and the
<PB N="217" REF="119">
Wind continued &s;o very fair for us, that it gave us hopes of being quickly at the end of our Voy|age, was willing to let the Men enjoy them&s;elves a little more, and &s;o order'd that a pretty good &s;hare of Arack &s;hould be dealt out to every one of 'em. But there being &s;everal that were &s;ick, and could not u&s;e their Arack them&s;elves, di&s;po&s;ed of it to tho&s;e that were well, who having then too much of that &s;trong Liquor, made them&s;elves exceeding Drunk, and committed a great deal of Di&s;order: For tho' there is very &s;evere Laws on Shipboard, and tho&s;e are generally Executed with Rigour, yet &s;uch is the Seamen's Temper, that they ever grow more di&s;orderly and ungovernable as they come nearer home. Wherefore our Ma&s;ter being a very good hone&s;t old Man, re&s;olved to let none have any more, but tho&s;e that were in a fit Condi|tion to Drink it them&s;elves; And that this might be ob&s;erved punctually, he order'd the Under Steer&s;man to &s;tand by every day, and to &s;ee every body Drink their own Portion: By this means he put a &s;top to tho&s;e Di&s;orders, and prevented a great deal of Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>When we came more and more in &s;ight of the <HI>North-Star,</HI> we began to be very chearful, and fell a Singing of the Hymn,</P>
<P><HI>Hoe Schoon light ons de Morgen-Star.</HI></P>
<P>But by that time we got a little beyond the I&s;land <HI>Fero,</HI> the Weather began to &s;eem very Cold to us, tho' it was in the very middle of the Summer, that we could not bear to &s;it above Deck, till we had got &s;ome more Cloaths on. What made us &s;o very &s;en&s;ible of Cold was, that we came from &s;o Hot a Country as the <HI>Indies</HI> is. Here we ob&s;erved, That the day was 20 hours long, and that in the four hours that the Sun was below our Horizon, it &s;till gave &s;o much light on the one &s;ide, or the other of us, that a Man might make &s;hift to Read any Book of a
<PB N="218" REF="120">
fair Character any time of the Night, by the help only of that refracted light.</P>
<P>The next day our Ma&s;ter, and Steer&s;men, judged that we were not far from <HI>Hitland.</HI> Then we &s;aw continually great Flocks of Birds and flying Fi&s;h, which fell down in great numbers in our Ship. So Orders were given to watch on the Main-top-Ma&s;t-Head, and about the Evening one cry'd out Land. The Mountains a&s;&s;ured us &s;ufficiently that it was <HI>Hit|land;</HI> therefore we bore directly upon it with a brisk Gale, and no &s;mall Joy it was to us, that we were thus happily drawing apace towards our Country.</P>
<P>Thus we kept &s;ailing all the next day along that Coa&s;t, within about a League from it, and &s;o pa&s;t it. Quickly after that we &s;pied four Men of War, which we concluded were our Convoy; and being come &s;omthing nearer, we perceived them to be &s;o by their Colours: Upon which, we hung out ours, and fired &s;ome Guns for a Signal. We likewi&s;e Hall'd out our Boats to go on Board them, but the Wind hindred us from doing it. All the while we came nearer and nearer, and the Convoy having a &s;mall Tender with them, they loaded it with Provi&s;ions, and &s;ent it towards us; as it is always the Cu&s;tom to meet the homeward bound Ships, and to bring them fre&s;h Victuals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to refre&s;h them after &s;uch a long Voy|age. They brought &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els of Beer, Sack, Butter, Chee&s;e, Tobacco, Pipes, and Brandy.</P>
<P>When the&s;e things were brought on Board of us; one Ve&s;&s;el of Beer was put on the one &s;ide of the Main-Ma&s;t, and another on the other &s;ide; and tho&s;e were free for any body to go to, and Drink at Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>But we did not long Enjoy our &s;elves thus; For as we were ju&s;t coming to a pitch of Mirth and Jol|lity, &s;uch a dreadful Wind aro&s;e, as we had not met with any thing like it in our Voyage; and it terri|fied us &s;o much the more, becau&s;e we were near home,
<PB N="219" REF="120">
where we thought our &s;elves &s;ecure, not dreaming of any farther danger. The night came upon us, and our Ship being very old and crazy, began to &s;pring &s;everal Leaks, &s;o that we were forced to keep continually a Pumping. The Weather was &s;o cold, the night &s;o dark, and the Wind &s;o very boi&s;terous, that we were pa&s;t all hopes, except what we had in God's Gracious Providence, and to that alone we committed our &s;elves. The morning came, but gave us but a &s;mall Relief, for the Wind was as terrible as before; and &s;o it plea&s;ed God to hold on for four days together without Intermi&s;&s;ion; at the end of which, God was plea&s;ed to Calm the Wind and Seas, and re&s;tore us to our former Peace and favourable Gales; for which we all hear|tily offer'd up our Thanks to the Almighty.</P>
<P>Here we lo&s;t our Upper Steer&s;man, who had been &s;ick mo&s;t of the Voyage, and we threw him over|board.</P>
<P>We had after this hard Weather, a pretty good Gale of Wind which brought us quickly in &s;ight of the Northern Coa&s;ts. We &s;ail'd then all along by them, and &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e directly upon <HI>Holland,</HI> reckoning to reach the <HI>Maes</HI> in three or four days more. In our Cour&s;e we met with &s;ome Fi&s;her|men, who came a-board of us, and &s;old us &s;ome fre&s;h Herrings. This was to me the greate&s;t Fea&s;t I had had a great while, and I think I never liked any thing better in my life. Among tho&s;e Fi&s;her|men, there was one, that was as he &s;aid, 142 years old; and becau&s;e we &s;crupled to believe him, he &s;hew'd us an Extract of his Birth out of the Regi|&s;ter-Book: He was as Active at his Bu&s;ine&s;s as any of his Fellows.</P>
<P>Shortly after this came a Pilot on Board of us, and by Orders from the Company, took the Go|vernment of the Ship on him&s;elf, and di&s;mi&s;t the Ma&s;ter: So we came to ca&s;t Anchor before the
<PB N="220" REF="121">
<HI>Briel.</HI> As &s;oon as we had ca&s;t Anchor here, the Deputies of the Company came on Board of us: They are generally two of the olde&s;t that are Deputed for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e Gentlemen call'd all the Ship's Crew together, and thank'd them in the name of all the Company for their Faithfulne&s;s and Diligence in their Service; from which they im|mediately freed them, and promi&s;ed them that they &s;hould be paid with &s;peed: After which, every one was at liberty, and was carried to Shore in &s;ome &s;mall Ketches that came for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Immediately upon this, came other Seamen on Board the Ship, which they call <HI>Sjouwers.</HI> The&s;e Furl'd in all the Sails, and took them down; fired all the Guns and charged them again. All the Pro|vi&s;ions they found remaining was theirs. Every one of us was forced to leave his Che&s;t on Board, they being all to be brought to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Hou&s;e, and there to be Search'd.</P>
<P>The Wound I had received in the Wars of <HI>Ban|tam</HI> had of late been a little unea&s;ie to me; and the two Bullets which were ever &s;ince that time in my Leg, began to be a little trouble&s;ome: But now my Pain increa&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t upon me, that in a very little while after we came to the <HI>Briel,</HI> I was no more able to walk at all by my &s;elf; but was forced to be carried into a Hou&s;e by a Couple of our Men. I was &s;orry I had not a little more time to Ea&s;e my &s;elf here; but the re&s;t being ready to go for <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> I was obliged to be gone along with them.</P>
<P>Being come to <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> and having within 3 days time received my Che&s;t back again, as all the re&s;t likewi&s;e had. I was forced to go from thence to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> that being the Chamber where I had engaged my &s;elf; and from which I was to receive my Money. Thither I went partly by Land, and partly by Water; but either way with &s;o much pain
<PB N="221" REF="121">
and unea&s;ine&s;s, that all the Hard&s;hips I had under|gone in all my Voyages were not to be compared to that: Yet was I full of Acknowledgement to Almighty God, who had deliver'd me out of &s;o many Extream Dangers to which I had been ex|po&s;ed, from the mercile&s;s Sea, fierce and cruel Ser|pents and Bea&s;ts; and from &s;everal Heathens of many Nations more Barbarous than them all, and had brought me again into a Chri&s;tian Country. And though I was not in Health of Body, yet it was an exceeding Comfort to me, to have &s;o good Opportunities again of making better Provi&s;ion for my Soul, and to participate of that Holy Sacra|ment from which I had been ab&s;ent during &s;even years. Wherefore being in this weak Condition, the chief thing I de&s;ired was to have a Mini&s;ter, and to receive the Communion. My Landlady help'd me to one who was the Mini&s;ter of the Ger|man Lutheran Church at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> from who&s;e Pious Di&s;cour&s;e, and Ab&s;olution, together with the Ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, I received an exceeding great Comfort, and then very chearfully re&s;ign'd my &s;elf up to the Almighty's Plea&s;ure. I thank'd my Gho&s;tly Father for his Kindne&s;s, and made him a Pre&s;ent of &s;ix Ducatoons, &s;ome Ro&s;es of <HI>Jericho,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>China</HI> Ware.</P>
<P>My Pain encrea&s;ing rather than dimini&s;hing, and I growing daily wor&s;e and wor&s;e, I &s;ent for a Doctor and two Chirurgions, not willing to tru&s;t to my own Skill only. And being I was not able to go and receive my Money my &s;elf, I was ob|liged to &s;end a Per&s;on to the <HI>East-India</HI> Chamber to receive my Money and Goods, by Virtue of a Letter of Attorney which I gave him. The Mo|ney that was Due to me from the Company did not amount to more than 4 or 500 Ducatoons, which was all the Fruit of my Labours; except &s;ome con|&s;iderable <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods I had brought over on
<PB N="222" REF="122">
my own Account, which I had to Sell: But by that time I had &s;atisfied my Attorney, my Do|ctor, and the two Chirurgions, and defray'd the re&s;t of my Charges, I found my Bag very light. My Doctor did not co&s;t me above Forty Dutch Gilders: The two Chirurgions, who were two of the mo&s;t famous Arti&s;ts in the whole City of <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI> had Eighty Rixdollars; They had taken out my two Bullets, and cleared the Bone of a|bove Twenty Splinters, great and &s;mall: For my Lodging, I paid TWO Rixdollars a Week, and had but a very poor Accommodation neither. The Apothecary too came in with a hideous Bill. In &s;hort, I &s;hould have been but in a mi&s;erable Con|dition if I had not had Money: And that went after &s;uch a Rate, that in le&s;s than Three Months time I had &s;pent above 300 Ducatoons. How|ever, I began to recover a little, and my pain was not &s;harp as before; tho' I could not go or &s;tand as yet: But as &s;oon as I was able to &s;tir, I was re|&s;olved to continue my Journey, and &s;et out of this place, and endeavour to get home, what|ever befel me. And in order thereunto I took a Coach to carry me to the <HI>&V;trecht-Poort,</HI> where I took Boat for <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Cleveland</HI> to <HI>Cologne.</HI> By that time I was got hither, I was &s;o fatigued, that I was not in a capacity of moving any further; and therefore I was forced to lie &s;till here for near three Weeks; during which time, I &s;pent a great deal of Money again, and was &s;o weak that I had hardly any hopes of ever reaching &s;o far as home; nor did any Body think I &s;hould ever have recover'd. But it plea&s;ed God to Ble&s;s human Endeavours, &s;o that I recovered a little again; upon which I immediately got my &s;elf carried to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and there went on Board a Ship which carried me to <HI>Mentz,</HI> and thence to <HI>Franckfort.</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="122">
Some Relations and Gentlemen of my Acquain|tance were &s;o kind as to come to meet me before I got Embark'd on the <HI>Rhine;</HI> but I was not in a Condition to take notice of them. However, they were &s;o Civil, as to Convoy me along the Shore. When <HI>I</HI> was come to <HI>Franckfort, I</HI> was forced to &s;tay without the City two days before they would permit me to enter, and the Weather being very Cold, <HI>I</HI> made but a poor &s;hift in the Ship all that while: till at length, the Chirurgions came to me, and went them&s;elves to the Burgher-Ma&s;ter; upon which <HI>I</HI> was let in to the City that very night, tho' late. It being hard to get a Lodging in an Inn at that time of night, &s;ome good Friends of mine carried me to a private Hou&s;e, where &s;ome of my Acquaintance came to Vi&s;it me. One of them got me a Coach, which in &s;even days time brought me to the place where <HI>I</HI> &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be, the City where <HI>I</HI> was Born. There <HI>I</HI> found all my Dear Si&s;ters alive and well, who received me with all the Demon&s;trations of that &s;incere Love and Affection they had for me, and were extream|ly Serviceable to me.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>I</HI> fini&s;h'd my Travels, which had taken up Nine whole years: And by the Faithful Relation which <HI>I</HI> here give thee of them: Thou may&s;t not only &s;ee, what Dangers and Difficulties <HI>I</HI> have been expo&s;ed to in &s;o many various Adventures, but al|&s;o thou oughte&s;t to Admire the wonderful Goodne&s;s of God, who &s;o wonderfully delivers Men, and never for&s;akes tho&s;e that put their Tru&s;t in him. And not being able to Prai&s;e him &s;ufficiently my &s;elf for his great and &s;ignal Mercies to me, <HI>I</HI> heartily de&s;ire that every thing that hath Breath may Prai&s;e the Lord.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Ri&s;e of the Dutch <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company. Many go to the <HI>Indies</HI> induced by a fooli&s;h hope of growing Rich there. Kidnappers &s;end many thither. The Author's going off from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to the <HI>Texel.</HI> What Ships were &s;ent out. Ice and hard Weather detains them &s;ome Weeks in the <HI>Texel.</HI> Orders given in ca&s;e they meet and &s;hould fight with the French. The Allow|ance distributed to the Ship's Crew. They meet with Turki&s;h Pyrates. Sentence given on a Criminal. The <HI>Equinoctial</HI> Line. Great Mortality under it in the Ships. A Remarkable Accident that befel the Author. Northern Pyrates. The <HI>Devil's Mount</HI> in <HI>Africa</HI> Arrival to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IT is about &s;ixty years &s;ince &s;ome rich Merchants and others in <HI>Holland,</HI> as at <HI>Am&s;terdam, Enck|hui&s;en, Rotterdam, Leyden, Delft, Hoorn, Mid|dleburgh,</HI> and <HI>Fle&s;&s;inguen,</HI> having joyned Stocks, made
<PB N="226" REF="124">
up a Company, Rigg'd out &s;ome Ships, and Man|ning them with Officers and Seamen, &s;ent them to the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> They have from time to time mightily increa&s;ed their Strength there, and at length made them&s;elves &s;o powerful, as to wage War, not only again&s;t &s;ome Kings of <HI>Europe,</HI> as of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Portugal;</HI> but to be able al&s;o to Curb &s;everal Kings and Emperors of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> And hereby they are already become much more Wealthy than &s;ome Kings are, and grow every day greater and greater.</P>
<P>The rich Things which &s;everal Per&s;ons have brought with them out of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> the great Booty which &s;everal opportunities offer to Men, the ju&s;t and exact Pay of tho&s;e who are em|ployed in the Service of the Company, on the one &s;ide; the de&s;ire of &s;eeing &s;trange Countries, and the Cu&s;toms and Manners of People, &s;o far di&s;tant, on the other, induce many Men to undertake this Voyage: Be&s;ides that, there are many Strangers that come into <HI>Holland,</HI> who are drawn in by a &s;ort of Kidnappers, to engage them&s;elves in the Ser|vice of the Company, allured by the hopes of great Profit and Advantage.</P>
<P>The&s;e Buyers and Sellers of Men, are People that entice Strangers to their Hou&s;es, if they &s;ee they have but little Money, or are in perfect want, or if they come of them&s;elves through Nece&s;&s;ity, re|ceive them, and provide 'em with Meat, Drink, and Cloaths plentifully, till the Ships are ready to go, and the People Embark; Then each Kidnapper brings his Men, &s;ometimes Ten, Twenty, Thirty, to the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Hou&s;e, and there gets them li&s;ted. Some days after this, he receives for each Man, for his Pains and Charge, a Note of a 150 Guldens, and Two Months ready Pay, which the Soldier or Mariner, whatever he be, mu&s;t Earn out. And the Note is not paid till it comes to be Due in
<PB N="227" REF="124">
Monthly Wages. An Account of what Pay is due to every one is &s;ent every year out of the <HI>Indies</HI> to <HI>Holland,</HI> and may be &s;een upon the Books there. But if one of the&s;e Men happens to Die in the Voyage, the Kidnapper loo&s;es all his Charge; for in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the Company doth not pay him his Note, becau&s;e it was not workt out.</P>
<P>The&s;e Men, to Entice Strangers to go, make them believe &s;trange Stories of the <HI>Indies,</HI> promi&s;e them va&s;t Things, and are not a&s;hamed to go &s;o far as to put a Hammer into their Hands to knock the Diamonds out of the Rocks they &s;hall meet with. Many of the&s;e poor Fellows Ruin them&s;elves Body and Soul, by Marrying Indians, and running over from the Chri&s;tians to &s;ome Heatheni&s;h King, when they have Habituated them&s;elves to their Cu&s;toms and Manners: Others meeting with untimely Deaths, among&s;t Drinking, or other ill Company, which often happens: Others committing what Co&s;ts them their Life by Sentence of &s;ome Court of Ju&s;tice. And becau&s;e the&s;e Men trapan that &s;ort of People to go a Voyage that commonly proves their De|&s;truction, they are generally call'd, <HI>Ziel-Verkopers</HI> or <HI>Kopers,</HI> that is <HI>Soul-Buyers</HI> or <HI>Sellers.</HI></P>
<P>I for my own part was forced, for want of Money, to be &s;ome Weeks at one of the&s;e Jack-Call's Hou&s;es for Entertainment, paying a 170 Guldens, the two Month's ready Pay being reckon'd in; and I was accepted by the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company on the 15th of <HI>November</HI> 1675. as a Volunteer, and was made Steward of the Ship call'd <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> My Pay was 20 Guldens <HI>per</HI> Month of Dutch Money; and I was to &s;erve them five years in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Conditions, I, with &s;everal others, went off from <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> in a little Smack to the <HI>Texel,</HI> on the fir&s;t of <HI>December</HI> 1675. There the Fleet lay that was ordered to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of Five Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>A&s;ia</HI> Ad|miral,
<PB N="228" REF="125">
the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> Vice-Admiral, the <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> the <HI>Cortgeene,</HI> the <HI>Tidor:</HI> We &s;aw be&s;ides, a great many Engli&s;h and Dutch Men of War and Merchantmen, that &s;taid for a good Wind.</P>
<P>The 2d of <HI>December,</HI> I Embarkt on Board the <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> together with &s;everal others, engaged in the &s;ame Service.</P>
<P>The 3d <HI>Ditto,</HI> The Dutch Gentlemen that were Owners came on Board of us, with a very rich little Yatcht, wi&s;h'd us a good Voyage, and took their leaves of us.</P>
<P>The 4th there came a Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter, to &s;ee if all tho&s;e that belong'd to the Ship were in it. There was in ours, the Chief Merchant, the Ma&s;ter, the Chaplain of the Reformed Religion, with his Wife and four Children, four Steer&s;men, one Book-keeper, five Barbers and Chirurgions, two Mates, two Stewards, two Cooks, two Gunners, four Car|penters, three Coopers, two Sail-Makers, two Quarter-Ma&s;ters, one Serjeant, two Corporals, two Under-Corporals, 150 Soldiers, and 93 Fore|ma&s;t-Men, nine Boys to Swab the Ship every day, and one Boat&s;wain; the whole number was 297 men. The Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter having taken a view of all, wi&s;h'd us a good Voyage and a good Wind.</P>
<P>The 5th, The Wind blew very &s;trong at North-We&s;t, &s;o that we were obliged to drop four An|chors at one time, of which each weigh'd 36 hun|dred Pound.</P>
<P>The 12th of <HI>January</HI> 1676. The greate&s;t Trou|ble we had was cau&s;ed by the Ice that came again&s;t us in great Flakes from the North, and encompa&s;s'd us on every &s;ide, &s;triking continually again&s;t our Ship, and did our Cables a great deal of Damage. Therefore our Officers having con&s;ulted what to do, re&s;olved, That if the Wind did not change in three days, we &s;hould leave Ship and Goods, and go back to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> with the light Ve&s;&s;els; that the Men
<PB N="229" REF="125">
as well as Ships might not peri&s;h, as it happen'd 15 years ago, when 15 founder'd about the &s;ame place.</P>
<P>The 13th <HI>Ditto,</HI> At Eleven a Clock at Night the Wind changed and blew very fair for us at S. E. upon which a Gun was fired from our Admiral, all the Ships in the Fleet being to be govern'd by it, and was a Signal that every one was to weigh An|chor, and make ready to Sail.</P>
<P>The 14th, early in the morning, &s;ailed fir&s;t the Admiral, with Flags and Pendants on the Main|ma&s;t; after him the Vice-Admiral, with a Flag on the Forema&s;t; and then the <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> with a Flag on his Mizen-ma&s;t, and then the other common Ships.</P>
<P>The 15th, An Engli&s;h Fi&s;herman came to us, and gave us Information that there were 16 French|men of War crui&s;ing near <HI>Calais,</HI> with two Priva|teers and two Fire&s;hips laying wait for our Fleet. We &s;ent out immediately a Yatch for true Intelli|gence, which came back to us on the 16th, and brought us word, that the Enemy was making up to us. Then we fell back to the Rode of <HI>Duyns,</HI> and lay under the Cannon of that place, while we prepared our &s;elves for Fight, and to Con&s;ult what we were to do: Upon this we had the&s;e following Orders agreed on.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> That all Captains, Seamen, and Officers, &s;hould carefully ob&s;erve what Signals and Commands were given by the Admiral, and Obey them punctually.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> That as &s;oon as the Enemy came in &s;ight of us, we &s;hould draw into the Form of a Half-Moon.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> That if we &s;hould happen to find a &s;trange Ship fall'n in among&s;t our Fleet, we &s;hould give the other Ships notice of it by firing off three of our Demy-Cannon.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="230" REF="126">
<HI>IV.</HI> In ca&s;e a Ship &s;hould be ready to &s;ink, it &s;hould give notice of it by hanging a Lan|thorn on the Forema&s;t, if it were night; or by hanging out a yellow Flag, if it were day.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> Being the Admiral upon Pain of Death, mu&s;t not yield him&s;elf, nor his Ship, into the Ene|mies Hand; the Vice-Admiral was (in ca&s;e of a Fight) to be nigh, and &s;econd him.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI.</HI> The Admiral was to put up two bright Lan|thorns, and the other Ships but one, that they might di&s;tingui&s;h and follow the Ad|miral.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>VII.</HI> Upon all Occa&s;ions, the Officers and com|mon Soldiers were to behave them&s;elves briskly and hone&s;tly, and to ob&s;erve very &s;trictly, the&s;e and all other Articles relating to the Fleet, upon their Peril.</P>
<P>The 17th, We lay &s;till, and a French Privateer came up the Engli&s;h Road, and pa&s;&s;ed by our Fleet, narrowly viewing it, and &s;truck in to Sea again.</P>
<P>The 18th in&s;tant, in the morning, Our Admiral &s;hot off one piece, and hung up a Blue-Flag for a Signal to hoi&s;t up Sail, which was done accord|ingly, with many di&s;charges of our Cannon in Ho|nour to his Royal Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>England,</HI> which were an&s;wer'd from <HI>Dover-Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>The 19th, We &s;aw the French Fleet about a League di&s;tance from us, but when they &s;aw that we were &s;o &s;trong, they did not dare to fall upon us, but made home to <HI>Calais.</HI></P>
<P>On the 20th, We lo&s;t &s;ight of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> The Sea that lies between them two is call'd the Channel, and is 96 miles long. After this we came into the Sea of <HI>Spain.</HI> The Water there looks extreamly blue by rea&s;on of its being &s;o va&s;tly deep. About Noon, the Admiral &s;ets up a white Flag, and fires a Gun, to give notice to all the Captains, Ma&s;ters, and Stewards, belonging to
<PB N="231" REF="126">
the Fleet, to come aboard his Ship, which they did; and whil&s;t he treated them, and all were mighty merry, the danger of the French coming upon them being over, the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> fell foul on our Ship, and gave us a terrible &s;hake. The <HI>Ma|ca&s;&s;ar</HI> got a great Hole in her &s;ide by it, but it was ea&s;ily &s;topt again. Towards Evening, our Gue&s;ts went to their re&s;pective Ships, and the Cannon kept firing all the Night.</P>
<P>The 21th in the morning early, The Ships, that till then kept together, parted, each taking their &s;everal Cour&s;e to the Places they were Bound for. Some went to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> others to <HI>Smirna, Spain, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Portugal.</HI> We that were bound to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> being five Ships, kept on to the South-We&s;t, having a very good Wind at N.

<P>The 22th, Our Men aboard the <HI>A&s;ia</HI> were divi|ded into two parts; the one call'd the <HI>Prince</HI>'s, the other Count <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Quarter, one of the&s;e Quar|ters was to watch by turns four hours a piece at Night; when the Watch on the one &s;ide wanted to be relieved by &s;ome body of the other, two Men &s;ung a Song to awake them.</P>
<P>In the Evening of this day, The <HI>Rant&s;oen</HI> (as we call it) began, that is, we came to a &s;et Allowance, which was, to every Per&s;on three Pound of Bi&s;|ket a Week, half a Pint of Vinegar, a quarter of a Pint of <HI>Lisbon</HI> Sallad-Oil, and every day a Gill of Brandy: On &s;ome days we had Stock-Fi&s;h and Pea&s;e boil'd in Water, upon which we us'd to pour a little Oil and Vinegar: But the next morning we had a Wooden-Di&s;h full of boil'd Barley allowed to every &s;even Men. On Sundays, Tue&s;days, and Thur&s;days, our Dinners was Pork, or other Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>From the 23th of <HI>January</HI> to the 24th of <HI>February,</HI> nothing remarkable happen'd, except that the cold Weather had quite left us; And we &s;aw the Fi&s;h
<PB N="232" REF="127">
&s;ometimes driving one another to and fro, and particularly the flying Fi&s;h, about the bigne&s;s of a Herring, always in fear of being devoured. The longe&s;t Flights they could take was about a Musket|&s;hot, and then they were forced to light on the Water to wet their Wings again: By this Flight they e&s;cape indeed from their greate&s;t Enemies, the Dolphins and the Porpoi&s;es; but then they of|ten become the Prey of Sea-Birds, call'd Boobys: Here we &s;aw Birds and Fi&s;hes flying together.</P>
<P>The 25th of <HI>February</HI> we &s;aw <HI>Pico de Canaria,</HI> or the <HI>Canarie</HI> Mountain: We &s;teer'd our Cour&s;e thither, and came pretty near it by the next day; and then we found that we were 20 Leagues off when we fir&s;t di&s;cover'd it. Otherwi&s;e, upon a &s;mooth Sea, we could not &s;ee farther than five Leagues in a &s;treight Line. This difference hap|pens from the extraordinary height of the Hill above the &s;urface of the Water.</P>
<P>The 26th, 27th, and 28th <HI>Ditto,</HI> we had good Weather.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> early in the morning, We &s;pied two Ships with Dutch Flags and Pendants, that were Roving about; but we would not tru&s;t them, for we knew the Turki&s;h Pyrates u&s;ed to Lurk about this Mountain of the <HI>Canaries,</HI> or the Southern I&s;lands. After a Council of War held, our Admiral, about Noon &s;ailed foremo&s;t to take better notice of them, and he quickly found them to be what we &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>We were not the only one who made our &s;elves ready for a Fight, but our four Ships that came after, at about a League di&s;tance, did the like, and gave us notice by an appointed Signal, that they were prepared. We expected them, and towards the Evening, the Enemy came &s;ome|what nearer to us, yet not within &s;hot; all that Night we kept a very &s;trict Watch.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="127">
The 2d <HI>Ditto,</HI> very early in the morning, the Wind blew hard at North-We&s;t, by which means we lo&s;t &s;ight of the Turki&s;h Ships about Twelve at Noon; and about the Evening it cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The 3d, we made va&s;t way with a good Wind, and about four hours after we &s;pied a Ship, and found by her running &s;he was one of the Turks we had &s;een the day before; our Ma&s;ter being a very brisk Sea-Soldier, (his Name <HI>Peter Vander Woet&s;tiin)</HI> found that he could not po&s;&s;ibly out|&s;ail this Pyrate; &s;o he lower'd his Sails and &s;taid for him, as much as to &s;ay, that he did not fear him. The Turk &s;ailed by us with his Dutch Flag up, as near and &s;wift as he could: He pretended to be a Friend of ours, and &s;et a Renegado to Hail us, and ask us in Dutch, What Ship? And whither Bound? Our Ma&s;ter ordered the Gunner to fire, and the Men fired &s;o briskly with the lower Tire, and batter'd the Mahometan &s;o &s;orely, that they made all the ha&s;te they could to get away, and found work enough to mend the Holes our Guns had made.</P>
<P>The 4th in the morning, about 7 of the Clock, this Turk, batter'd as he was, came up to us again; his De&s;ign was to clap us on board, and to Storm us. We having a &s;ufficient Force on Board, defended our &s;elves &s;o bravely, that the Enemy was obliged to run again at night with no &s;mall lo&s;s. On our &s;ide, we had Twelve kill'd and Twenty wounded, Soldiers and Seamen: The wounded were all cured. In the mean while, the Carpenters were employed in Re|pairing what Damage the Enemies Shot had done us, and &s;topping the Holes.</P>
<P>The 5th <HI>Ditto,</HI> Our Chaplain Preached a Thank&s;giving Sermon for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance God was plea&s;ed to give them, delivering them through his Mercy out of the Hands of tho&s;e Cruel Ty|rants:
<PB N="234" REF="128">
And after that, our Ma&s;ter and Admiral thank'd his People for the help they had given him with &s;o much Gallantry; and ordered a Bot|tle of Sack for every Man.</P>
<P>From the 6th to the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> we had very blu&s;tering Winds, and a dreadful violent Storm, &s;o that we often thought our &s;elves at the very brink of Death.</P>
<P>The 25th, While that Tempe&s;tuous Weather &s;till la&s;ted, the Mate and his Boy were catch'd together acting the abominable Sin of Sodomy: A Council was held upon it, and Sentence was given that they &s;hould be tied back to back, (which was done by the Boat&s;wain), and tied in a Sack, and thrown alive into the Sea. As the Mini&s;ter was doing his Duty towards the&s;e Malefactors, repre&s;enting to them the hainou&s;ne&s;s of their Crime, and directing them to prepare for Death, the Boy, about 14 years of Age, wept bitterly; But the Mate, being an Italian, about 40 years old, &s;hew'd him&s;elf mighty ready to Die, &s;aying; 'Twas bet|ter he &s;hould be puni&s;h'd alone for his horrid Sin, then that the whole Ship &s;hould &s;uffer for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>The 26th, the Wind cea&s;ed; But we hardly knew where we were, nor had known it for 20 days time, having not been able to make an Ob|&s;ervation &s;ince the 6th day: And,</P>
<P>On the 27th, it being very fine Weather, we found that the Storm had carried. us under the Equinoctial Line. Here it is extream unhealthy, and a certain Di&s;temper &s;eized mo&s;t of our Men, which made them raving mad: In one day five Per&s;ons died, one of which was our Chaplain, the other four Soldiers. The&s;e Dead Men, were (according to the Cu&s;tom of our Dutch Ships) &s;ew'd, each Corps by it &s;elf, in a &s;heet, and after our u&s;ual Morning or Evening Prayer, (with a P&s;alm &s;ung at the end of it) thrown in|to the Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="128">
The 28th, we had no Wind: On this day, one of our Barbers, and two Seamen died; and two Soldiers, in their raving Fit, (cau&s;ed by the intollerable Heat) leapt into the Sea; which two of our be&s;t Swimmers perceiving, leap'd in after them, and brought 'em into the Ship again: But one of 'em after all this, hang'd him&s;elf that very Night by his Bed-&s;ide.</P>
<P>On the 29th, The other Soldier that had leapt in the Sea, died, having no regard to any good Advice that was given him, and could not be made to Pray. We had not a Breath of Wind this day, nor</P>
<P>The 30th and 31th: The&s;e two days we threw over-board our late Chaplain's 4 Children, 4 Chi|rurgions and Barbers, a Carpenter, and 10 Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t, 2d, 3d, and 4th of <HI>April,</HI> the Calm held us &s;till; And in tho&s;e four days we lo&s;t a Steer&s;man, two Carpenters, the Serjeant, and 30 Sol|diers and Seamen; &s;o that we expected every Soul &s;hould Die out of the Ship.</P>
<P>The 5th <HI>Ditto,</HI> it plea&s;ed God to deliver us from that fatal place by a favourable Wind at We&s;t and by-South. We had &s;till a great many &s;ick Men, and not enough in health to be able to Brace our Main-Sail, tho' the Mortality cea&s;ed; &s;o we were forced to make &s;hift with our &s;mall Sails. That day we caught with a Hook one of the great Fi&s;hes called Sharks, that rowl'd and to&s;s'd about our Ship. We de&s;ign'd to dre&s;s him, and refre&s;h our &s;elves with it; but when we cut it open, we found in the Belly of it our Serjeant that we had thrown over-board, not yet dige|&s;ted. The &s;ight of this &s;o turn'd our Stomachs, that none could find in their Heart to Eat of the Fi&s;h; &s;o that we threw Man and Fi&s;h into the Sea again. It is ob&s;ervable, That the&s;e great Fi&s;h have always &s;ome &s;mall ones to go before
<PB N="236" REF="129">
'em, that are called by the name of Pilot-Fi&s;hes, and &s;wim in and out of the Shark's Mouth. And when a Shark is catch'd, they cleave to his Back like a Burr.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t not omit what happen'd to my &s;elf. As I fell Ill and was in a Swoun, he that look'd after the &s;ick, took me for Dead, and fetch'd a new Shirt out of my Che&s;t, and was putting it upon me; The Sail-maker too was a going to &s;ew me up; and he handling me a lit|tle roughly, after all his pu&s;hing and to&s;&s;ing of me, I open'd my Eyes: Tho&s;e that were about me were not a little &s;tartled; and &s;aid, it was high time for me to open 'em; for if I had winck'd but a little longer, over I had gone. Our chief Merchant gave me a Gla&s;s of Sack, which refre&s;hed me very much.</P>
<P>From the 6th to the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> we had a very fair Wind and good Weather. In that time we &s;aw &s;ome of the Northern Capers, and a great many Whales, which kept us Company till we came on</P>
<P>The 20th, within &s;ight of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>Mount</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> which is very remarkable for its height.</P>
<P>The 22th, We came happily into the Road near the Land call'd, <HI>Capo de Bonne E&s;perance,</HI> or the <HI>Cape of Good Hope.</HI> And here we met again with two of our Ships, <HI>Cortgeene</HI> and <HI>Tidor,</HI> which had been parted from us, and we had not &s;een, &s;ince the 2d of <HI>March.</HI> They gave us an Ac|count, That they had been bu&s;ie with the Turk|i&s;h Privateers that fell upon us, and that they had wetted their Feet; which was, that they had &s;unk 'em. However, They took up 36 of their Men that could Swim be&s;t, and brought them along with them. This News gave us a great deal of Joy. The Pri&s;oners we &s;ent hence imme|diately to the <HI>Robin-I&s;land,</HI> to gather Mu&s;&s;el-&s;hells, and others, for the burning of Lime.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE 23th of <HI>April,</HI> early in the morning, I went on Shore of <HI>Africa</HI> with our Admi|ral: From this place to <HI>Amsterdam</HI> they reckon
<PB N="238" REF="130">
u&s;ually 2000 miles. At this Cape we lay &s;till nine days, and in that time provided our &s;elves with Water, Wood, and other Nece&s;&s;aries. As to the Qualities of this Land, by what Ob&s;ervation I could make of it, I found it to be: Fir&s;t Fruitful; And for that Rea&s;on, our <HI>East-India</HI> Company hath cau&s;ed &s;ome years ago, many very &s;trong Places to be Built there by the Water-&s;ide, clo&s;e under the <HI>Duyvel's-bergh, Lewen-bergh,</HI> and <HI>Tafel-bergh,</HI> well &s;tored with Soldiers, and all things ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and are &s;ufficiently provided again&s;t the In|cur&s;ions of the Wild-Men; &s;o that their Ships go|ing to and from the <HI>Indies,</HI> may &s;afely, and with|out any danger, put in there at any time, and take in Provi&s;ions, whether it be of Cattle, Water, Wood, or other Refre&s;hments. And here are al|ready a great many Boors that are come from <HI>Hol|land,</HI> and by rea&s;on of the great Priviledges that are granted them, have &s;ettled there, and have Tilled the Land and made it very fruitful, for a matter of 20 or 30 miles round about tho&s;e Places. Secondly, Very populous: The Inhabitants are called wild Africans, or <HI>Hottentots.</HI> Their Colour is like that of the Egyptian Heathens, or as we call them corruptly, Gyp&s;ies. The Hair of their Head grows entangled in one another, like the Wool of a young Lamb; upon which they hang for Orna|ment all manner of Sea-&s;hells. They are of a mid|dle &s;tature, and well proportioned, only that they have their No&s;es a little too flat and broad.</P>
<P>They wear no manner of Cloaths, only a Sheeps-skin or Calf-skin on their Shoulders, (and that's be|&s;meared with Grea&s;e to make it &s;oft and pliant) when it is a little Cold, or when it Rains. They wear the Tail of a Fox, or of a wild Dog hanging before their Privy-Parts. The Women among the&s;e <HI>Hottentots</HI> have a different Ornament from the Men, which is the Gutts of their Cattle fre&s;h killed.
<PB N="239" REF="130">
The&s;e they wrap about their Legs, not minding the inconveniency it puts 'em to, which is &s;uch, that they can hardly go, and they leave 'em there till they are quite dry.</P>
<P>I had often-times been told, that the&s;e Women had naturally a little kind of a Flap growing over their Privities, like that of a Turkey-Cock's Bill, which I had a mind to &s;ee if it were true; but upon Examination, I found nothing of Truth in it. My Experience co&s;t me only &s;ome Tobacco.</P>
<P>The&s;e People have a very &s;trange Speech, and make &s;uch a di&s;agreeable Noi&s;e with their Mouth, as other Nations cannot imitate; but a great many of them that live near to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope</HI> can &s;peak &s;ome Dutch. They have no manner of Religion, Prayers, or Laws, only they Wor&s;hip the Moon. The fir&s;t time that they &s;ee it; they &s;pend that whole Night in Dancing, Singing, and Bawling Ha, ha, ha, ha. They do not at all trouble them&s;elves with Building or Planting: So that they have no con&s;tant abode, but move from place to place with their Children and Wives, where they can find Pa&s;ture for their Cattle. They Eat all &s;orts of Fruits and Roots that grow either above or under-ground. They make no difference, whether their Meat is kill'd, or dead with any Di|&s;temper, or whether it be Man's Fle&s;h: Whatever it be, they throw it upon &s;ome Coals, leave it there a little while, and &s;o Eat it.</P>
<P>They lie in &s;mall Hutts or Holes, every one with his Wife. If any of the Women have two Chil|dren at one Birth, they kill the weake&s;t, that the other may have the Brea&s;ts to him&s;elf, and grow &s;tronger and lu&s;tier. As &s;oon as the Boys come to be about Twelve years of Age, they cut off his right Te&s;ticle, that he may be the fitter for Running.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="131">
They have &s;ome Kings among&s;t them, and a great many Captains, and have cruel Wars be|tween one another. They &s;hoot Darts, and are excellent at hitting a Mark with a Stone. The Women too will come in often and carry their Husband's Arms: If they take any of their Ene|mies, they kill 'em and eat 'em with great Joy and Sa|tisfaction. And in the &s;ame manner they u&s;e the Europeans too, (who come often to Truck a lit|tle Tobacco or Bracelets, for a good parcel of Cows and Sheep) if they can get them into their Hutts.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Rich. They have all manner of wild Bea&s;ts. For here are the furious Lions, which re|gard no Man, and when Hungry, fall upon Men and Bea&s;ts and Devour them. The Grinning Ty|gers. The va&s;t Elephant for Bulk and Strength. The Angry Rhinoceros. The skipping and clam|bering Ape: Be&s;ides, Wild Dogs, Bears, Wolves, and wonderful fine Wild A&s;&s;es, all in great num|bers; As al&s;o O&s;triches, which have indeed Fea|thers and Wings, but cannot Fly by rea&s;on of their bigne&s;s and weight. Their Eggs are hatch'd of them&s;elves, and not (as &s;ome mi&s;-informed Per|&s;ons have given an account of it) by their conti|nual looking after 'em. Sea-Cows, that lie in the fre&s;h Rivers all day, and at night come on Shore to feed: Their Fle&s;h is better than that of Swine. Stag and Deer, Wild-Boars, Partridges, Peacocks, Gee&s;e, Wild-Ducks, and other &s;ort of Poultry, too long to give an Account of, all which are here very plentiful.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> towards Night, the <HI>A&s;ia, Tidor,</HI> and <HI>Cortgeene,</HI> put off together to go forwards, and continue our Cour&s;e (with the help of God) to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="131">
The 2d we had a General Day of Humiliation in our three Ships. For tho' we were now out of Danger of Sea-Robbers, we were not &s;o from Storms and Tempe&s;ts, and other fatal Accidents.</P>
<P>The 3d, The Wind blew very hard at N. W. tho' it was Serviceable for us to &s;et us forward.</P>
<P>The 14th, The Wind grew higher &s;till: And in the Afternoon, a Merchant's Son of <HI>Franckfort, Morel</HI> by Name, going, (as it was u&s;ual) to the fore-part of the Ship to Ea&s;e Nature, fell into the Sea; and all our Endeavours to help him were in vain, by rea&s;on of the boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;s of the Waves, and our &s;wift Sailing: That &s;ame day the two Ships of our Company, the <HI>Tidor</HI> and <HI>Cortgeene,</HI> parted from us.</P>
<P>From the 5th to the 10th the &s;ame Wind la&s;ted.</P>
<P>The 11th, We felt it very Cold.</P>
<P>The 12th, We had a mixture of Hail and Snow, and two of our Seamen fell in and were drowned.</P>
<P>The 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th <HI>Ditto,</HI> We hoi&s;ted up but one Sail, and ran very &s;wift, the Wind blowing almo&s;t a Storm, and made commonly 70 miles, or more, in 24 hours.</P>
<P>The 21th, We reach'd the Altitude of the I&s;land St. <HI>Maurice.</HI> This I&s;land was not long &s;ince Inva|ded by the Dutch <HI>East-India</HI> Company, before which time it was not Inhabited. It is fruitful, and has great &s;tore of Wild-Deer; It produces Amber-Gree&s;e, Ebony, and other fine Woods.</P>
<P>The 22th, A Seaman of ours fell unluckily from the Main-Ma&s;t upon one of our great Anchors, and from thence into the Sea, and &s;unk immediately, his Breath being gone with his fir&s;t fall.</P>
<P>The 23th, We came again into a warm Cli|mate, and we had a very favourable Wind to the end of this month.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="132">
The fir&s;t of <HI>June</HI> it was very &s;till, but very Rainy Weather.</P>
<P>The 2d, Our u&s;ual Allowance of Fle&s;h, Bread, and Beer, was le&s;&s;ened, which did not plea&s;e mo&s;t of us very well.</P>
<P>From the 3d to the 20th, We had nothing remarkable, &s;ave that we &s;uffer'd in &s;ome mea&s;ure both Hunger and Thir&s;t, tho' that contributed much to our Health, according to the Proverb, which &s;ays, <HI>That Hungry Men will not over-&s;leep them|&s;elves;</HI> and much Sleep being unhealthy, the &s;harp|ne&s;s of our Stomachs would keep us from any &s;uch Indi&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The 21th, Our Ma&s;ter promis'd Twelve Crowns to any one that &s;hould di&s;cover Land, upon which we all look'd about us very &s;harp, and kept very &s;trict Watch, taking great notice what Colour the Water was of, by which we often have notice that we draw near the Land; in the mean while we were bu&s;ie with getting of our Anchors ready.</P>
<P>The 22th, in the morning, One that &s;tood on the top of the Main-Ma&s;t, cry'd out, Land, and being ask'd which way he &s;py'd it, he an&s;wer'd, Directly in the Ea&s;t, and that it was a high Land. This was about Sun-ri&s;ing, and about Noon we found that he had not been mi&s;taken; for it was the very Land which we were to go to, <HI>viz. Java Major,</HI> or <HI>Great Java;</HI> This occa&s;ion'd a very great Rejoycing, for now we had Bread and Water al|lowed in abundance.</P>
<P>The 23th, We came into the Road of <HI>Sunda,</HI> which is about 36 miles long: Here we were ob|lig'd, by rea&s;on of the Calm, and the fiercene&s;s of the Tide again&s;t us, to ca&s;t out our Anchor. While we lay there, &s;ome of the Inhabitants of <HI>Java</HI> came to vi&s;it us, and brought us all manner of Indian Fruits; &s;uch as <HI>King's Apples, Mellons, Figs, Citrons, Bananas, Sugar, Rice,</HI> and other-like things; all
<PB N="243" REF="132">
which Refre&s;hments we had of them in exchange for old Iron and Tobacco. They came in little Boats, but oddly made, and very ill put together, but they &s;ail very fa&s;t with 'em.</P>
<P>The 24th, Two of them were &s;ent over to us out of <HI>Bantam,</HI> laden with Fruit from <HI>Java,</HI> Ducks, Goats, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This day we made &s;ome of our way with a good Wind, but towards the Evening we ca&s;t Anchor, the Wind being changed.</P>
<P>The 25th, in the morning, betwixt 9 and 10 a Clock, we &s;aw at the right Hand of us, the Royal City <HI>Bantam;</HI> In the afternoon, about 4 a Clock, we came into the Road before <HI>Batavia:</HI> Our Cabin-Boy &s;wimming very well, and having a mind to re|fre&s;h him&s;elf in that Water, was unexpectedly catch'd and devour'd by a Crocodile.</P>
<P>The 26th, in the morning, We were fetch'd to Shore in a &s;mall Skiff to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to our great Joy: Thus we did (by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance) compleat this great Voyage from <HI>Amsterdam</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> in five months and 12 days, and in le&s;s than 24 weeks, made 3636 miles.</P>
<P>The 27th, Came in the <HI>Tydor</HI> and <HI>Cortgeene,</HI> which came out with us from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and which had not been &s;een &s;ince the third day after that until now. This made them all very glad in <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>This day at night, all the Soldiers that were &s;ent here from <HI>Holland,</HI> were brought, well Arm'd and in good Order, before the Dutch General there, called <HI>Maetzuycker:</HI> He welcom'd them; and after that, the Officers divided them, and &s;ent them, &s;ome into the City, and &s;ome into the Fort.

<P>The 28th, 29th, and 30th, We had three days liberty to go up and down, in and out of the City; and here we much wondered to &s;ee the Chine&s;es, (of which &s;everal live here upon the account of their great Trade) carry Meat and Drink to tho&s;e that are Buried in the Church-yard, in Ve&s;&s;els of fine <HI>China,</HI> lamenting, and asking them, Why they Died, and what they wanted; and telling them, it was unkind not to let their Friends know of it; But the Dead there, as well as here, are very &s;ilent. This good Chear of theirs is generally carried off by the Dutch Soldiers and Seamen, who Fea&s;t them|&s;elves with it, when they have Game'd away their Money, or otherways &s;pent it. Be&s;ides the&s;e Chi|ne&s;es, there are &s;everal other Ea&s;t-Indians, and other Heathens, that live at <HI>Batavia,</HI> and drive a great Trade there. They are all oblig'd to joyn toge|ther in the common Defence of the City, in ca&s;e of Nece&s;&s;ity; chiefly the Javans, the proper Inhabi|tants of this I&s;land: They are very Tawny, and wear only a Girdle about their middle, of fine Linnen, or Silk: They are Circumcis'd as the Turks: Some of them Wor&s;hip an Image with a Lion's Head, the Sun, and the Moon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ide Amboine&s;es, Tarnatans, Malleyers, Ma|cha&s;&s;ers, and other-like Nations, each of the&s;e have their Kings; are very skillful with Weapons, which are Bows, Arrows, Javelins, Spears, and Poi&s;oned Darts. When they go into the Field, they adorn their Bucklers with a great deal of finery, wearing on their Head a very fine Bird, call'd the <HI>Bird of Paradi&s;e,</HI> which is found in <HI>Amboyna,</HI> about 500 miles from <HI>Batavia.</HI> Their warlike Mu&s;ick is an In&s;trument made of Mettle, called Gum-Gum, much in the Nature of our Drums; It makes a greater noi&s;e than a good large Bell. The Amboyne&s;es
<PB N="245" REF="133">
are great Necromancers; and from hence it is &s;aid, Doctor <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> got his Ma&s;ter, and was carried thither through the Air riding upon a Cloak.</P>
<P>From the 1&s;t of <HI>July</HI> to the 9th, We were daily exercis'd in the handling of the Musket and Pike, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The 10th, Some of the &s;toute&s;t and briske&s;t of all our Men were pick'd out and &s;ent,</P>
<P>The 11th, Under the Command of Major <HI>Pool|man</HI> a Brandenburger, Captain <HI>Harzing,</HI> Captain <HI>Roodbol,</HI> Captain <HI>St. Martini</HI> a Frenchman, and Cap|tain <HI>Dack,</HI> each with his Company, and Embark'd in one Ship to go to <HI>Japara</HI> to quell the In&s;urrection there, and to help the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> again&s;t the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The 12th, Our Seamen too, belonging to our five Ships were divided into Companies, and provided with Hand-Granadoes, &s;harp Cutlaces, Pikes, Bills, and other Weapons u&s;eful in War: Their Officers were the Ma&s;ter as Captain, the Mate was made Lieutenant, the Boat&s;wain a Serjeant, and the Quarterma&s;ters Corporals.</P>
<P>The 13th and 14th, We pa&s;t by <HI>Bantam,</HI> and af|wards by <HI>Toppers-hoedie,</HI> and the <HI>Prince</HI>'s I&s;land.</P>
<P>The 15th, We &s;aw our Enemies in an innume|rable quantity of little Skiffs. They had notice of our approach, and de&s;igned to keep us from their Wall; &s;o they came to meet us, and quite &s;urrounded our Ship: Their intent was to get on Board, then Storm, and Rob us. All this while, our Grana|diers and Soldiers were employed, and fought &s;o briskly, that that day we de&s;troy'd about 1100 of their Skiffs, little and great. We had but few of our Men killed, but many wounded. We could not tell the number of the Enemy that was &s;lain; for &s;uppo&s;ing there were as many of their Boats &s;unk, as I &s;aid ev'n now, the number of the Men is uncertain, for they hold according to their big|ne&s;s

from 6 to 30 Per&s;ons. And be&s;ides, As their Boats &s;unk, abundance of them were Swimming to Land, like &s;o many Water-Spaniels for about a mile's &s;pace, and &s;o &s;aved their lives. Our Booty was but &s;mall; for the Indians had nothing about them but Provi&s;ion and Arms, the be&s;t part of which fell into the Sea.</P>
<P>The 16th, early in the morning, We were put a&s;hore all together to pur&s;ue the Enemy, whil&s;t they were &s;till terrified with their late lo&s;s. We ex|pected to make an ea&s;ie work of it, but they un|der&s;tood, and we found it, otherwi&s;e. They fell upon us like Mad-Dogs, in va&s;t numbers, and of all &s;ides. The <HI>Opium</HI> that they u&s;e to take always before they engage, had made 'em &s;tark Mad; &s;o that they kill'd the flower of our Officers, and 150 private Soldiers: And at la&s;t, the re&s;t of us were forced to Flee and Swim for our Lives to get into our Ship.</P>
<P>The 17th, All our &s;ick and wounded were put into a Ship, and &s;ent to the Ho&s;pital in <HI>Batavia;</HI> And a Letter &s;ent to the General, and the Council, to acquaint them, that we wanted a &s;re&s;h A&s;&s;i|&s;tance and Recruits to go on in our Enterprize.</P>
<P>The 18th, We &s;ent out a large Boat, with a Lieutenant, and Soldiers and &s;ome Seamen, to go a&s;hore and view the place, and give us Intelligence; but the Enemy fell upon them, and &s;lew every one of them, except one Seaman; who,</P>
<P>On the 19th, came &s;wimming to our Ship very quick, having the &s;tream with him. He gave us an account, how they were fell upon by four Boats full of tho&s;e Japarians, who killed all his Compa|nions; and as for his own &s;afety, he had made his way through 'em with a great lighted &s;tick of Wood, that he &s;natcht up from under a Kettle, and with that kept them at &s;uch a di&s;tance who were half Naked, that he had room and time to

throw him&s;elf into the Water to Swim for his Life, tho' they continually &s;hot at him with their Ar|rows. Our Ma&s;ter order'd him immediately a Gla&s;s of Sack to refre&s;h him, for he was &s;adly weaken'd, having been almo&s;t a day and a night in the Water.</P>
<P>The 20th, After a Council held, Letters were written to the General <HI>Maetzuycker,</HI> in <HI>Batavia;</HI> and I was one of tho&s;e that were order'd to go with them.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed all the 21th, 22th, and 23th, and arrived happily at <HI>Batavia</HI> on the 24th, and deli|vered our Me&s;&s;age and Letters.</P>
<P>The 25th, An Advice-Boat was &s;ent with a Letter to the Fleet at <HI>Jappara,</HI> to order them to come all back to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The 26th, A new Ship from <HI>Holland</HI> arrived here, and brought us an Account, That they had been 9 months a coming, and that 18 of their Men died in their Voyage.</P>
<P>The 27th, Came another Ship in, which the Hollanders had given over for lo&s;t, having been gone from <HI>Zealand</HI> above 18 months, and they had no News of it all that while. The Ma&s;ter of it told me, They had undergone a great deal of Hard&s;hip; (which one might ea&s;ily &s;ee by the Ship and her Crew.) Among&s;t other things, he told us, That they had been driven &s;o far Southward by a continual Storm, that their Compa&s;s did 'em no more Service, the Needle turning from one &s;ide to the other irregularly. At la&s;t, they had di&s;cover'd in the night, a high Land, which ap|pear'd to them like Fire; but they turn'd their Backs to it, and &s;ail'd &s;o long, till they came at la&s;t by meer good Fortune, to get the u&s;e of their Compa&s;s again.</P>

The 28th, A Ship came from <HI>Malacca</HI> to <HI>Bata|via,</HI> which brought a great many Spiauters and Pellicans of a Purple Colour, as al&s;o a Ca&s;&s;wari: This is a great Bird that has no Feathers on his Body, but Hair, like Hog's Bri&s;tles. It will Eat red-hot Coals, Tobacco-Pipes, Iron, and leaden Bullets; but doth not Dige&s;t any of 'em: It hath no Tongue, but makes a Noi&s;e as Shrill as that of a little Go&s;ling. Of this Bird we &s;hall take an oc|ca&s;ion to tell you a very plea&s;ant Story by and by.</P>
<P>The 29th, Four Seamen were publickly Beheaded at <HI>Batavia,</HI> (which is here the common Death of Criminals) for having killed a Chine&s;e. At the &s;ame time, &s;ix Slaves that had Murthered their Ma&s;ter in the night, were broke upon the Wheel. A Mulatto (as they call tho&s;e that are begotten betwixt a Black-a-Moor and a White) was Hang'd for Theft. Eight other Seamen were Whipt for Stealing, and running away, and were be&s;ides this, Burnt on the Shoulder with the Arms of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company. Two Dutch Soldiers that had ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the Guard two days, ran the Gauntlet. A Dutch Schoolma&s;ter's Wife that was caught a Bed with another Man, (it being her frequent Practice) was put in the Pillory, and Condemn'd to 12 years Impri&s;onment in the <HI>Spin|huys.</HI></P>
<P>During the time of Execution, the Gates of the Fort, and of the City, were &s;hut up, and all the Garri&s;on in Arms.</P>
<P>The 30th, Came 32 Javans, with a Crocodile, 22 Foot long, which they had caught with a great Crook, and brought into the Fort to &s;hew it to the General, who having taken a view of it, gave the Fellows that brought it 6 Rixdollars for their Pains: So they carried it away again.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="135">
The 31th, A Javan came into <HI>Batavia,</HI> and gave an Account of the General's Hunt&s;man's being fall'n upon by a Tyger, and torn in pieces by him.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d of <HI>August,</HI> The Dutch Bur|gers and Soldiers, as al&s;o the Indian Inhabitants of <HI>Batavia,</HI> drew up in the <HI>Galge-Veldt,</HI> each by them|&s;elves, and made a very fine &s;hew. Many of the Indians here &s;hew'd their Activity in Leaping, and in exerci&s;ing their Arms, <HI>viz.</HI> Shields, Bows, Ar|rows, and Pikes. The mo&s;t remarkable Leaper among&s;t them all, was one Captain <HI>Joncker,</HI> who Leapt cleverly over a Dutch-Trooper, that was mounted on a Per&s;ian Hor&s;e. We Hollanders were Po&s;ted, (about the Hou&s;e where our General and the Lords of the Council of the <HI>Indies</HI> were, with their Wives and Children) with four Companies under Arms, ready in ca&s;e the Indians (who were in great numbers) &s;hould attempt to Ri&s;e or make a Rebellion. This &s;hew was made to entertain the <HI>Heer Rycloff Van Goens,</HI> a Dutch Admiral, that was newly come over, and was then one of the Lords of the Council, and a &s;hort time after was made General.</P>
<P>The 4th, Twelve Slaves of the Heer <HI>Speelman</HI>'s one of the Council of <HI>India,</HI> run away; they had taken a Boat and got to <HI>Bantam.</HI> The Mu&s;ter-ma&s;ter of <HI>Batavia,</HI> went with &s;ix Servants, all Guinea-Gaffers, well provided with Cutlaces and other Arms, in a Yatch in pur&s;uit of 'em. They &s;oon met with them, but the Slaves &s;o well de|fended them&s;elves, that they kill'd the Mu&s;ter|ma&s;ter and all his Company; and went on to <HI>Bantam:</HI> where they thought them&s;elves very &s;afe, but to their Grief, they found them&s;elves mi&s;taken; for as &s;oon as they Landed, they were known to be Fugitive Slaves, and &s;eized and &s;ent back.</P>

On the 7th, All the Twelve were broke upon the Wheel in the place call'd the <HI>Galge-Veldt.</HI> The manner of doing it is thus: There are four Po&s;ts drove into the Ground, and &s;tand out about two foot: To the&s;e they Tie the Malefactor's Hands and Feet; Then comes the Executioner with a Bar of Iron, and breaks his Limbs one after the other, and at la&s;t gives him one Blow on the Brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The 8th, A Seaman was found in the Square, (the Dutch call it the <HI>Vierkant)</HI> cut mo&s;t dreadfully with a Knife. This Square is a very large place, and is &s;o called, becau&s;e it hath four Angles. It was built by the Engli&s;h about 60 years ago. Af|terwards the Dutch got it from 'em, by this means, (as I am informed.) Some Dutch Ships came clo&s;e to this Square; Their Admiral begg'd the favour of the Engli&s;h Governour, that he might be per|mitted to bring in his Men, (who were very &s;ick with their long Voyage) for recovery of their Health and for Refre&s;hment; which the Engli&s;h Governour generou&s;ly granted out of Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion. The Dutch &s;ent two Boats full of their be&s;t and &s;toute&s;t Men, arm'd privately with &s;uch Weapons as might not be di&s;cover'd, as Swords, Knives, and Pi&s;tols, and with a feigned groaning and grunting, were let in at the Water-Gate; and being got in, fell upon the Engli&s;h, and &s;lew one part of 'em, and took the other Pri&s;oners, and plunder'd all their Goods. (vid. Van He&s;&s;e<HI>'s Ac|count of the taking of</HI> Batavia <HI>in his Voyage.)</HI> Since that time, the City and Fort was built by the Dutch, who have now made it &s;o &s;trong both within and without, with Walls and Ditches, (which never are frozen up by rea&s;on there's no Winter here) that the place is inacce&s;&s;ible, and is able to re&s;i&s;t all their Ea&s;t-Indian Enemies. The Fort, with the 4 Ba&s;tions, (which I have given an Account of al|ready)

commands all the Streets of the City, the Square, the Water-Gate, and the Road where the Ships lie.</P>
<P>The 9th, Our Armourer &s;ent Orders to all the Guards, That tho&s;e who wanted Musket-Balls &s;hould come to the u&s;ual place at 4 a Clock in the After|noon, (after they had been Exerci&s;ed,) and fetch 'em. He &s;ent out before-hand, a Box full of 'em by two of his Slaves from the Store-Hou&s;e, and bid them &s;et it down in the great Court. A while after, coming to give 'em out, he found his Box empty. He runs immediately to our Captain, and com|plains, That the Soldiers had &s;tole away the Bullets: The Captain &s;ets him Sentinel for his Negligence; and then had all the Soldiers &s;earch'd: But on</P>
<P>The 10th, They found out that the <HI>Ca&s;&s;wari</HI> Birds (of which we have made mention above) that run all about the Fort, had &s;wallowed all the Bullets, and dropt them here and there, as they wander'd about, whole and undige&s;ted. Our Armourer was forced for his Carele&s;&s;ne&s;&s;, to go all over the Fort to pick up the Bullets that were fall'n, and to hunt the Birds about to make them re&s;tore the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The 11th, As an old Chine&s;e was coming along the &s;aid Fort, with two Ve&s;&s;els of Milk to &s;ell; a Peacock that belong'd to the General, &s;eeing him, flew up upon his Head, and had certainly pickt out his Eyes had it not been for &s;ome Slaves that beat him off. This old Chine&s;e had once been the riche&s;t Man in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and worth &s;ome Tuns of Gold, which he had play'd away at Dice, and lo&s;t the very Hair of his Head which was his la&s;t Stake.</P>
<P>The 12th, I went into the City to a Chine&s;e's Hou&s;e to drink a Gla&s;s of their Gra&s;s-Beer, which is made of Sugar, and is very plea&s;ant. There I &s;aw their manner of Eating: Seven of 'em, all Men, &s;at at a Table by them&s;elves, for they will not tru&s;t them&s;elves among the Europeans, nor will

they let them &s;ee their Wives: Be&s;ides their Wives, they keep &s;everal <HI>Malleyers,</HI> that are fine Women, tho' of a tawny Complexion, and broad No&s;es, whom they Buy for their u&s;e. The&s;e Wo|men have the liberty of &s;hewing them&s;elves abroad: Their Ma&s;ters lie with them at their Plea&s;ure; but be&s;ides the&s;e Women, they frequently keep Swine for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, and make the &s;ame u&s;e of 'em.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Table &s;tood a very large <HI>China</HI> Di&s;h, with a great many little ones in it, which were filled, &s;ome with Fi&s;h, and boil'd Rice in&s;tead of Bread; &s;ome with a &s;ort of a Me&s;s made of Citrons, which they call <HI>Ar&s;chhar;</HI> and others, with a pickl'd &s;ort of Fruit like our Barberies, which they pre&s;erve in Juice of Citrons and Vine|gar. Each Man had a Wooden thing in his Hand like a pair of Tonges, which they u&s;e in&s;tead of a Fork, to Eat their Meat with. After they had done Eating, they took every one a Whiff of Tobacco out of a Pipe (which they call <HI>Gur-Gur)</HI> the Bole whereof is &s;o large, that it would contain half a Pint of Water.</P>
<P>At the time of their Meals, they did not forget their God, which was an Idol made of Wood, and &s;tood very finely adorned upon a Table, with a Lamp burning by it. Him they &s;erved fir&s;t with their be&s;t Fruits and Meats, and laid it all decent|ly on a Board that &s;tood by for that purpo&s;e. I was &s;o intent upon ob&s;erving them, that I never minded my Drink, tho' it was excellent, and continually expected to &s;ee that Devil Eat the Victuals that were &s;et before him; but I found, I might have &s;taid long enough, for he was &s;o mode&s;t, he would not offer to touch them, &s;o I came away: For I &s;aw they did not like my &s;tanding &s;o near their Door to ob&s;erve 'em as I did, and they knew me to be a Dutchman.

<P>The 24th, Two Ships happily arrived before <HI>Batavia;</HI> the one from <HI>Siam,</HI> loaden with Spiauter; the other from <HI>Tarnate,</HI> loaden with Cloves, Nut|megs, and Mace. They brought us the News of a great deal of mi&s;chief that had happened in <HI>Am|boina</HI>
<PB N="257" REF="139">
and <HI>Tarnate</HI> about 500 miles Ea&s;tward from <HI>Batavia,</HI> by the Earthquakes, that are very frequent there, and commonly every year. Among&s;t others, a part of an I&s;land that was &s;unk by an Earthquake in the year 1674. which at that time was &s;aved, and was very rich in Clove-Trees, was now wholly &s;unk.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that know the way of living here, need not much wonder why that I&s;land &s;hould have &s;uch &s;evere Misfortunes fall on it. The Spaniards here|tofore found this I&s;land, and &s;eeing it abound &s;o much in Spices, fortified it with Ca&s;tles and Towers, and adorn'd it with Churches, Cloi&s;ters, and Schools: But they exerci&s;ed an exce&s;&s;ive Tyranny over the Inhabitants. For after they had treated with them and e&s;tabli&s;ht them&s;elves in Peace, the Don's car|ried them&s;elves &s;o haughtily and cruelly, that if an Inhabitant chanced to meet 'em, and did not go 10 or 12 &s;teps out of their way, and then &s;tand &s;till, till the proud Spaniard was gone by, <HI>Sinioro</HI> made no more on't, but thru&s;t him through the Guts with his Cinque-Palm, (a Sword five Span's long) and laid a certain piece of Money, call'd a <HI>Perdau,</HI> upon the Dead Body: After which, the Murtherer was free from any Puni&s;hment, nor was he liable to be accu&s;ed or reckon'd a Murtherer. And in this manner they have dealt with abundance of poor Indians upon any &s;light occa&s;ion, and often|times out of a meer in&s;olent Humour. This Ty|rannical Spani&s;h Yoke hath been made &s;omewhat lighter to 'em by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Dutch; but the latter too, often plagued them &s;ufficiently, tho' not &s;o bad as the former; and being once become Ma&s;ters, turn'd the Churches, Schools, and Cloi&s;ters into Warehou&s;es, Inns, or Taverns, to &s;ave the Charge of Building new ones. To this exce&s;&s;ive height of Inhumanity and Irreligion they were come, till in the year 1674. they were overwhelm'd by
<PB N="258" REF="140">
an Earthquake, and their Forts, Walls, and Hou&s;es &s;unk, together with a great number of the Inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>The 25th, Two Elephants pa&s;&s;ed by our Fort, which the King of <HI>Siam,</HI> who keeps his Re&s;idence in <HI>Odea,</HI> &s;ent as a Pre&s;ent to General <HI>Maetzuycker;</HI> be&s;ides 35 hundred weight of Spiauter: With this, His Reque&s;t was, That we &s;hould lend him a Man to make him &s;ome Gun-Powder; promi&s;ing that he would &s;end him back again to <HI>Batavia</HI> in two years time.</P>
<P>The General received the Pre&s;ent, thanking the Amba&s;&s;ador; and de&s;ired him to return his Thanks to his Ma&s;ter for his Favours, and to tell him, That he would heartily have fulfill'd his Maje&s;ty's De&s;ire, but that he could not po&s;&s;ibly do it then, becau&s;e he had but one of them him&s;elf, which he could by no means &s;pare; but that he had &s;ome Powder that was at his Maje&s;ty's Service.</P>
<P>From the 26th to the 31th, We were obliged to appear every day upon the place where we u&s;ed to Exerci&s;e, with our Companies, and fire again&s;t two Elephants that were newly come from <HI>Ceylon,</HI> which were brought every day to that place, that they might &s;tand firing, and be u&s;eful in fight.</P>
<P>From the 1&s;t to the 30th of <HI>September,</HI> I did not &s;tir out of the Fort, by rea&s;on of a terrible Head-Ach that &s;eiz'd me, and &s;uch a terrible one, that it fetch'd all the Hair off my Head; nor was I able to bear the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the Weather. I us'd no other Remedies but Bathing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Refre&s;hing my &s;elf every night and morning (after Sun-ri&s;ing and Sun-&s;etting) in the Water that runs about the Fort, tho' that was very dangerous, by rea&s;on of the Crocodiles that are there.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> Three Companies of the Gar|ri&s;on of <HI>Batavia</HI> were order'd to Embark in three Ships, call'd the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar, Polsbroeck,</HI> and <HI>Polran</HI>
<PB N="259" REF="140">
to go to the I&s;land <HI>Ceylon.</HI> They were all to be ready the next day to go off: I being one of the Company that was to go, took my leave of my Friends, and made my Provi&s;ion of Fi&s;h, Sugar, Dates, Citrons, and other Nece&s;&s;aries for my Voyage.</P>
<P>The 2d, About 10 a Clock in the Forenoon, each Company went to its appointed Ship; We and our Lieutenant (called <HI>Henrick Rentzen Van Oldenburgh)</HI> went to our Admiral-Ship, call'd the <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar;</HI> In the Afternoon a Mu&s;ter-Ma&s;ter came to vi&s;it the Ships, to &s;ee whether all the Men were on Board or no. If at any time one ab&s;ents him&s;elf after Or|ders given, and is found on &s;hore, he is condemn'd to remain in Chains till the Ship in which he was to have gone is come back again.</P>
<P>The 3d, early before day, The Ma&s;ter order'd the Gunner to fire one piece, which was the &s;ignal for our two other Ships to weigh Anchor, and to hoi&s;t up Sails. At break of day, (the Sun ri&s;ing here all the year round at 6 in the morning, and &s;etting at 6 at night) we &s;ail'd with a Land-Wind by <HI>Bantam:</HI> In the afternoon, when we came to have a Sea-Wind, it blew very hard, and quite again&s;t us; &s;o we were forced to ca&s;t Anchor, and lie there &s;till, till</P>
<P>The 4th, about two at night, The Tide and Land-Wind turn'd for us again, which carried us as far as the <HI>Prince</HI>'s I&s;land, where we were to take in Wood and fre&s;h Water.</P>
<P>The 5th, 6th, and 7th, I went a&s;hore with five Soldiers, well provided with Arms, to defend tho&s;e that cut the Wood, from the Tygers; and to &s;hoot &s;ome Fowls, &s;uch as Peacocks and Ducks; for this I&s;land being not much inhabited, does very much abound with all &s;orts of Fowl.</P>
<P>The 8th, at break of day, We weigh'd our An|chors, and pa&s;s'd that day through the Road of <HI>Sunda,</HI> and came about the evening into the Sea.
<PB N="260" REF="141">
The Wind was S. E. and by S. our Cour&s;e lay mo&s;t toward the North.</P>
<P>The 9th, We were divided into two Quarters, for the better regulating the Watch, that every one might know when to Watch, and when to enjoy his Humour. Till this time we had Water to Drink, and Rice enough, but boil'd only in Water.</P>
<P>The 10th, We had a very favourable Wind, And this day we came to an Allowance, which was, To each Per&s;on half a pound of boil'd Rice every day, half a Pint of di&s;till'd <HI>Arack,</HI> and a Pint and a half of Water: Two Pound of Bisket a week, and half a Pint of Vinegar, and half that quantity of <HI>Lisbon</HI> Oil. Sundays and Thur&s;days three quar|ters of a pound of Fle&s;h: On Tue&s;days a Quartern and a half of Bacon; Mondays, Wedne&s;days, Fri|days, and Saturdays, Gray-Pea&s;e, which we Eat with Oil and Vinegar.</P>
<P>The 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, We had &s;till a good Wind, and we began to draw pretty near the We&s;tern Coa&s;t. In the night, about the 2d Watch, which is between 10 and 2 of the Clock, we &s;aw a continual Lightning &s;hoot through the Clouds, which look'd like a mixture of black and red, and made the mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;ight that Man ever &s;aw. In the 3d Watch, called the Day-Watch, about 3 of the Clock, we chang'd our Cour&s;e from We&s;t and by North, to North and by Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The 16th, It was a very &s;erene Calm; But on</P>
<P>The 17th, 18th, and 19th, We had nothing but very uncon&s;tant Winds and Weather, and very dark Clouds all about us.</P>
<P>The 20th and 21th, We &s;aw neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars; from whence we concluded that we might expect a great Storm, and for fear of it we took in our Sails, and prepared our &s;elves for it.</P>
<P>The 22th, We had a &s;mooth Gale of Wind at We&s;t: Our Cour&s;e being Northward, we &s;aw con|tinual
<PB N="261" REF="141">
Lightning, and heard much Thunder: I was Amazed that it la&s;ted &s;o long, and I enquired of our Ma&s;ter, and of &s;ome of the olde&s;t Seamen, what could be the rea&s;on of it. They told me, That it was dark in that Country of <HI>We&s;t-Kust</HI> &s;ix months together; that the Country afforded great &s;tore of Pepper, and &s;ome Gold was to be found in the Mountains of it. For that Rea&s;on, the Dutch, af|ter a long War, had built there &s;ome Forti&s;ications, and kept Soldiers there, which hold it to this day. That the Europeans cannot bear the Climate long, it being very unhealthy; and unle&s;s they are fetch'd away within three years time, they generally Die. To prevent which, they &s;end fre&s;h Men thither every year. That tho&s;e that Die there are common|ly taken away &s;uddenly, as they are Eating or Drink|ing at Table. Their Food is Rice in&s;tead of Bread, Bufflars Fle&s;h, Beef and Pork, and Fi&s;h in abun|dance: Their Drink is <HI>Suri</HI> that comes from the Coco's, and Sugar-Beer, 3 or 4 years old, which they keep under Ground.</P>
<P>The 23th, The Wind blew hard at We&s;t. We &s;aw an infinite number of Fi&s;hes, called <HI>Springers;</HI> their length is generally about 6 or 7 foot, and about as much in thickne&s;s. Their Fle&s;h is very firm; they Swim always again&s;t the Wind. When they Leap very high out of the Water (as they did then) the Seamen expect a very great Storm and Tempe&s;t. We catch'd &s;everal of 'em with a certain In&s;trument, which they call an <HI>Elle|gaer,</HI> &s;triking it into their Bodies. This night the <HI>Polran</HI> parted from us, but we could not tell whe|ther it was done de&s;ignedly by the Ma&s;ter, or whe|ther it was by the Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Helms-Man, who&s;e turn it was to Watch.</P>
<P>The 24th, We were forced to take in our Main-Sail, by rea&s;on of the hard Wind, and defend our
<PB N="262" REF="142">
Deck all over with pitch'd Canvas from the Waves that were &s;o boi&s;terous, that they almo&s;t over|whelmed our Ship.</P>
<P>The 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th, We had &s;tormy Winds, but yet &s;o tollerable, that we made 25 or 30 miles of our way in 24 hours.</P>
<P>The 29th, The Wind increa&s;ed. The <HI>Polsbroeck,</HI> which &s;till kept us Company, gave us a Signal, that &s;he was &s;o full of Water, that &s;he &s;tood in need of our help. When we came to be &s;omewhat near, the Ma&s;ter told us, That his Pumps were good for nothing, and begg'd of us to lend him &s;ome of ours, which we did; for our Ship was &s;o &s;trong and clo&s;e, that it receiv'd no Water, and we did not want'em our &s;elves; but that night this Companion of ours lo&s;t us too.</P>
<P>The 30th, We took in all our Sails, and lower'd our Yards, and made our &s;elves ready for a Drift; that is, to bind the Helm fa&s;t, and commit our &s;elves to the Winds and Waves to drive us where they plea&s;ed. This Drift we held out in, till</P>
<P>The 4th of <HI>November,</HI> five days together. Upon Con&s;ultation held, we cut down our Main-Ma&s;t, which, with the force of its fall, was like to have &s;unk our Ship. Till that day we had not taken the height of the Sun, &s;o that we could not tell whither, or how far, we were ca&s;t.</P>
<P>The 5th, The Wind fell, and changed to the S. E. Then we hoi&s;ted up our Sails, and took the height of the Sun, whereby we found that we were clo&s;e by the Equinoctial, and not ca&s;t yet away &s;o far as we were afraid we had been. We &s;ailed N. E. and by E. all this Voyage we had that kind of Birds flying about us, that live upon the flying Fi&s;hes; but upon the great Heat we were now come into, they left us.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="142">
The 6th, We had a brisk Wind, and from &s;ix in the morning to &s;ix at night we made 20 miles of our way, and found the next day, being</P>
<P>The 7th, That we had pa&s;s'd the Line. Two Soldiers and three Seamen died out of our Ship that day, and were thrown, after Prayers, into the Sea: And we had about 20 &s;ick.</P>
<P>The 8th, The Wind changed to the South; and we were directly to go Northward. The Boat&s;wain's Mate catch'd a large Shark, in which they found four Boys, and &s;ome Bones of Men.</P>
<P>The 9th, We &s;aw a little Ve&s;&s;el that made to|wards us; in the afternoon it came near to us, and we were big with the hopes of &s;ome News they brought, but they were all vain: For our <HI>Orlamen</HI> (as we call them that have been before in the <HI>Indies)</HI> &s;poke to them in the <HI>Malleyers, Amboine&s;es, Cingu|lai&s;h, Malabari&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Maldavi&s;h</HI> Languages, but neither would do; and they an&s;wer'd us in a Lan|guage that none of us could tell what to make of; but they made us to under&s;tand by Signs, that they were in great want of Drink: Our Ma&s;ter had their Ve&s;&s;el boarded, and in it we found 24 Indians, with long Hair ty'd up on the left &s;ide of their Heads. They had with them 12 Muskets, &s;ome Gun-Powder, and Iron-Balls; pretty good &s;tore of Rice, Pepper, and dry'd Fi&s;h, but no Water. We &s;uppo&s;ed them to be &s;ome Indian Robbers come from the <HI>We&s;t-Kust,</HI> and drove thus far into the Sea by the late Storm. Our Ma&s;ter order'd them to be taken into our Ship, together with their Provi&s;ions, and we drew their Ve&s;&s;el along after us, ty'd with a &s;trong Rope to our Ship. We allowed them Bread and Water, and we made them Pump the Water out of our Ship, and Swab it.</P>
<P>The 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th, The Wind continued directly for us at South, we going on &s;till Northward.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="143">
On the 14th, We changed our Cour&s;e to the N. W. and by W. the Wind kept where it was, but &s;omething weaker. This day one that &s;ate on the Forema&s;t, holding by a Cord, the Cord broke, and he fell down Dead into the Ship.</P>
<P>The 15th, We ob&s;erved, that the Water begun to change colour; at night we u&s;ed the Plummet to &s;ound the Water, but we could find no bottom, tho' the Line was 200 Fathoms long.</P>
<P>The 16th, The Water changed yet more, and &s;eemed whiti&s;h; we made our Anchors and Cables ready, if occa&s;ion &s;hould be, to u&s;e them.</P>
<P>The 17th, Our Ma&s;ter promi&s;ed &s;ix Rixdollars to the fir&s;t Man that &s;hould &s;py Land, and a Flag|gon of Wine.</P>
<P>The 18th, We had a lovely Wind and good Sailing. A Seaman that &s;tood on the out-&s;ide of the Ship to draw up Water, was wa&s;h'd of by a Wave. We immediately tack'd our Ship, and back'd our Sails, and threw out our Long-Boat to go and take him up; which they did, and in about two hours time brought him &s;afe to us.</P>
<P>The 19th, We had a very fair Wind and fine Weather. Two of our Seamen quarrel'd, and fell at la&s;t to their Knives, and wounded each other. As &s;oon as the Ma&s;ter knew of it, he had 'em both Duck'd from the Main-ma&s;t, as wilful Tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors of the Laws of the Ship.</P>
<P>The 20th, about 6 in morning, our Boat&s;wain, a very expert Seaman, climb'd up the Main-top-gallant-Ma&s;t, which is the highe&s;t part of the Ship; no &s;ooner had he look'd about him, but he cry'd out aloud, Land, Land: The Ma&s;ter ask'd him, which way, and he told him to the North-Ea&s;t; &s;treight we changed our Cour&s;e from North We&s;t thither. The Helm&s;man threw out the Plummet, and found a &s;andy bottom at 80 Fathoms. In the
<PB N="265" REF="143">
afternoon we got &s;ight of the high &s;teep Mountain, call'd <HI>Adam's Pick,</HI> and by that we knew that this was the place we wanted to be at, <HI>viz.</HI> the I&s;land <HI>Ceylon.</HI> Towards night we changed our Cour&s;e again to the Ea&s;t, and &s;ometimes to the E. and by N. for we had no mind to be near Land that night, and we could not have reach'd the Road that day. In the fir&s;t Watch, between 6 and 10, we could feel ground &s;till, but in the 2d and 3d we could not.</P>
<P>The 21th, in the morning, at break of day, We chang'd our Cour&s;e again, and went directly to|wards Land lying South-Ea&s;t of us, with the Wind at S. W. About 10 a Clock before Noon we &s;aw the Ships that lay at Anchor upon the Road by the City of <HI>Columbo.</HI> In the mean while, the Wind veer'd four Points more to the W. and &s;o much the fitter for us. About Noon, we felt a &s;andy ground at 40 Fathoms, but we kept Sounding &s;till, till we were quite out of the deep, and in full &s;ight of the Land. This day every one had plenty enough of boil'd Rice, and the Water Ve&s;&s;els were free to any body. We had &s;uffer'd a great while Hunger and Thir&s;t, notwith&s;tanding that we had Cour&s;e Diet enough, and above 40 Barrels of Dutch and Bata|vian Water. The Soldiers now begun to Equip them&s;elves, to make a &s;hew at their Landing, and dre&s;s'd them&s;elves very &s;ine with great Joy and Sa|tisfaction. Their Arms, which till then had been kept up in the Gunner's Room, were delivered to 'em, to go out Arm'd, as is u&s;ual, to Shore.</P>
<P>All our Flags were out till about three in the af|ternoon, when we ca&s;t our Anchors, and found &s;till 12 Fathom Water. The Gunner was ordered to fire one Gun, and one Seaman was to &s;trike our Admiral's Main-ma&s;t Flag before the City of <HI>Co|lumbo,</HI> but immediately again to &s;et it up. After this, we fired all our Guns, to which the Fort of

The Governor of this City &s;ent two great Sloops of <HI>Ceylon</HI> to fetch us a&s;hore; in which our Lieutenant and Men went up to the Governor's Hou&s;e, who welcomed us all very heartily, and gave all our Men three days liberty to refre&s;h them&s;elves after their hard Voyage. The di&s;tance between <HI>Columbo</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI> is about 500 Dutch miles, which we had reach'd in 49 days, from the 3d of <HI>October</HI> to the 21th of <HI>November.</HI></P>
<P>The 22th, I went to Board with an old <HI>Cingulai&s;h</HI> Woman, becau&s;e &s;he could &s;peak a little Dutch; and &s;he got her living by keeping a Hou&s;e to enter|tain the Dutch, of which &s;he had generally 20 or 30 in her Hou&s;e. I paid 15 <HI>s.</HI> a Month, and 40 pound of black Rice. We had every one his own Di&s;h, &s;erved up with Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, Figs, and &s;uch like Diet, twice every day, at 8 a Clock in the morning, and 4 in the afternoon. Our Hou&s;e was only a Hut, made up of Boughs of Trees. And here I met with three of my old Acquaintance; who,</P>
<P>On the 23th, took me Abroad to a very large Orchard, call'd <HI>Tang Salgato,</HI> where we drank &s;ome <HI>Sury</HI> fre&s;h from the Coco-Trees. This was in the morning, and about noon we be&s;poke a hot &s;ort of Liquor, called <HI>Ma&s;&s;ack,</HI> which is made in the fol|lowing manner. They put into a Ve&s;&s;el 8 Quarts of <HI>Suri,</HI> and to that, one Quart of <HI>Arack</HI> or Brandy. All this boil'd together, and about 20 or 25 Eggs are broke into't, which gives it &s;ub&s;tance, and a good colour. Then they add to all this &s;ome <HI>Kings Sugar,</HI> (which they get from &s;ome certain Trees there) and &s;ome Nutmeg, and Mace: All this came to half a Rixdollar. We had &s;ome Wo|men to wait upon us, which they call <HI>Bulliato&s;es,</HI> who diverted us with various Leaping and Dancing. Their Ears are about a Span long, with Golden Pendants in them; They &s;aw by my Dre&s;s, that I

was newly come from <HI>Europe;</HI> and I found they had a great mind to Conver&s;e with me, but I not under&s;tanding them, made them under&s;tand by &s;haking my Head, that I did not Care for their Company.</P>
<P>The 24th, We took a walk about two or three miles out of <HI>Columbo,</HI> to &s;ee &s;ome tame Elephants that were kept in Orchards there. And having &s;een them, we went into the Hou&s;e which belong'd to a Portugue&s;e, who treated us very nobly; and at night had us home upon an Elephant of his. This day an Amba&s;&s;ador, named Myn Heer <HI>Bucquoi,</HI> was &s;ent from <HI>Ceylon,</HI> with a Lion, for a Pre&s;ent to the King of <HI>Candy.</HI></P>
<P>From the 25th to the 30th, Our Men were daily Exerci&s;ed, and at night our turn began to be upon the Guard, where my Po&s;t obliged me to be, till</P>
<P>The 25th of <HI>April</HI> 1677. which was five months, in which time I learned the Cingulai&s;h and Portu|gue&s;e Languages, finding them not only u&s;eful, but nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e that are to &s;tay there.</P>

<P>They came with two Ships, and landed at the place, where now <HI>Columbo</HI> is: The Cingulai&s;h King, being informed of it at <HI>Cotta,</HI> came out with an Army to meet them, but in vain; for his Men could not abide the &s;mell of Gun-Powder. The Spaniards fell to Building &s;ome &s;mall Fortifications, and to &s;ettle them&s;elves in the Country: As &s;oon as they were able to get &s;ome A&s;&s;i&s;tance, being well plea&s;ed with the Land and their Succe&s;s, they
<PB N="269" REF="145">
carried on the VVar not only again&s;t the &s;aid King of <HI>Cotta,</HI> &s;o as to beat him out of the City where he re&s;ided, and lay it wa&s;te, (as it is now to this day, a place where the wild Elephants are catch'd) but in time reach'd farther; and at la&s;t, of &s;even Kings that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this I&s;land, they de|&s;troyed &s;ix. But the &s;eventh, who re&s;ided at <HI>Candi,</HI> in the middle of the I&s;land, being vex'd to &s;ee with what Tyranny they u&s;ed his Subjects, begun to car|ry on a War very vigorou&s;ly again&s;t them, and con|tinually Plagues the Cities and Forts, which they had built on the Sea-&s;ide, and for about 20 miles into the Land. . How this Country fell from the Spaniards to the Portugue&s;es, and from the Por|tugue&s;es to the Dutch, I will give an Account hereafter.</P>
<P>Their chief Fortifications, are, the City and Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Columbo;</HI> eight Leagues Ea&s;tward of that lies the Fort <HI>Negombo;</HI> 20 miles further, the Fort <HI>Cal|pintin;</HI> again, 22 miles from thence, another call'd <HI>Aripen;</HI> and between tho&s;e two, the <HI>Paerl-Bank,</HI> heretofore &s;o famous: Six miles further, a very &s;trong Fort on the I&s;land of <HI>Manara,</HI> very fruitful, and &s;even miles in compa&s;s. This I&s;land of <HI>Manara</HI> is divided from <HI>Ceylon</HI> by an Arm of Salt-Water, about a Cannon-&s;hot wide. <HI>Ja&s;napaparnum,</HI> a for|tified City, lies 22 miles di&s;tant from <HI>Manara,</HI> and is &s;ecured with Ba&s;tions, call'd by the&s;e Names, <HI>Pas-Piil, Pas-Be&s;chatter, Pas-Elephant,</HI> and <HI>Punt de Pedre.</HI> Six and thirty miles farther, is the Fort called <HI>Trin|conamale,</HI> built by the Dutch again&s;t the French. This Fort the French had taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of; as al&s;o of the Bay, where Ships ride very &s;afe, under the Command of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Haye,</HI> as Viceroy, till the Dutch drove them away again. There is another Fort call'd <HI>Battacolo</HI> 40 miles from that. Thence to <HI>Punt de Gala</HI> 30 miles. Thence to <HI>Alecan</HI> 11 miles. Thence to <HI>Galture</HI> 5 miles. Thence round back again to <HI>Columbo</HI> 6 miles.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="146">
The De&s;cription I have given here of the&s;e out|ward Fortifications, makes the Circuit of this I&s;land to be in all 206 miles.</P>
<P>The Inland Fortifications, are; <HI>Maluane,</HI> 6 Leagues from <HI>Columbo; Hanguelli</HI> or <HI>Gourwebell,</HI> 2 Leagues from <HI>Malvane; Sittawaca</HI> 4 miles farther; <HI>Ruenell</HI> al&s;o 4 Leagues farther; <HI>Saffrigan</HI> and <HI>Bibliogam,</HI> 8 Leagues from <HI>Ruenell:</HI> And 12 Leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Columbo,</HI> you have <HI>Anguradotten</HI> and <HI>Caudingellen,</HI> lying upon two Rivers that run out of the King of <HI>Candi</HI>'s Country, very rich in precious Stones.</P>
<P>The I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon</HI> hath chiefly two &s;orts of In|habitants. Tho&s;e of <HI>Columbo,</HI> from <HI>Columbo</HI> to <HI>Ga|la,</HI> are called <HI>Cingulee&s;es</HI> or <HI>Cingulaians.</HI> They are very well &s;haped, part of a black, and part of a yellowi&s;h Complexion. The Men have long &s;treight Hair, and wear their Beards very large, like the Sui&s;&s;ers. They are generally very Hairy upon their Brea&s;ts, and they are very proud of it. They wear a piece of Linnen about their middle, from the Na|vel down to their Knees: But they make a very great di&s;tinction of their Apparel, according to their Dignity, and Quality.</P>
<P>Their King dre&s;&s;eth him&s;elf as he plea&s;es. His Cap is of Silk, wrought with Gold about a yard high, with a great Carbuncle before, and Rubies and Saphiires all round about it, and at the top a Bird of Paradi&s;e. His Shirt and Wa&s;tcoat is made of the fine&s;t Cotton, with Golden Buttons, and he wears a Garment of colour'd Silk, that goes 4 or 5 times round his middle, and hangs down to his Knees. His Stockings are fa&s;tned above his Knees with a &s;tring, whereon is fa&s;tned a &s;ilver Plate as large almo&s;t as a Trencher. His Shoes are only Leathern Soles with &s;trings, one of which comes up between his Toes, and the other comes round his Foot, and ties the Sole fa&s;t to it: And all the&s;e &s;trings are &s;et out with Saphires and Rubies. He
<PB N="271" REF="146">
wears a Sword clo&s;e under his right Arm, tied to a Silk Ribbon: It is very heavy, being in a ma&s;&s;y Silver Scabbard; it is made like a Hanger, and about a yard long; the Handle is ordered with fine precious Stones. On his left &s;ide, between his Shirt and his Wa&s;tcoat, he wears a long Knife, be&s;ides his Sword, inlaid with Gold and Jewels, and by that a &s;harp Pen, (wherewith they write upon Leaves of Trees) in a Silver Sheath.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of his Council, called <HI>Pi&s;are,</HI> and his Ge|nerals, may al&s;o wear Silk, Gold and Silver, but they are not permitted precious Stones for Orna|ments; and it is as much as their Lives are worth, to offer or pretend to wear any of 'em, tho' they are of little or no value; Nor do they dare &s;o much as take up one of them when they find them any where; and the greate&s;t, as well as the meane&s;t Per&s;ons throughout all the Kingdom, are equally obliged to the Ob&s;ervation of this Cu&s;tom.</P>
<P>His <HI>Corals,</HI> which are Governors over &s;ome one <HI>Coral</HI> or County, may wear Silk, but neither Sword nor Stockings. They wear a Staff tipt with Silver, with the King's Arms on it; they wear a &s;ort of Slipper or Shoe made of Wood, mighty neat, and very curiou&s;ly wrought.</P>
<P>Next to the&s;e <HI>Corals,</HI> the <HI>Apohami</HI> or Nobles are rank'd: They go dre&s;t as the <HI>Corals,</HI> excepting that they may not tie, like them, the Caps they wear on their Heads. The&s;e are to be known, when they come into the City, by their having a Slave always behind them to carry a <HI>Talpot</HI> Leaf after them, which &s;erves as an Umbrello when it Rains.</P>
<P>The next in Rank are the Scriveners and Hus|bandmen, who Manure the Fields of Rice. They mu&s;t wear nothing but Linnen, no Swords, Shooes, Stockings, nor Caps, only a Knife they may, and an Iron Pen. Their Wives, and tho&s;e of the above|named Per&s;ons may have their Garments from a
<PB N="272" REF="147">
handful above the Navel down to the Ground; but nothing upwards, but a &s;hort <HI>Bajuvan,</HI> as they Name it, which doth not come &s;o low as to cover their Brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>After the&s;e, are the Handicrafts-Men, as Car|penters, Gold&s;miths, Black&s;miths, Potters, Bar|bers, Burners of Chalk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e and their Wives may wear a Linnen Garment from the middle downwards, and &s;et out their Ears with Gold. After them are the <HI>Trivitors,</HI> who gather the Drink from the Trees and boyl the Sugar: <HI>T&s;challias</HI> that peel off the Cinnamon: The Fi&s;hermen and the <HI>La&s;erins</HI> their Soldiers: <HI>Mainets</HI> their Wa&s;hers: Borrowayen, their Drummers: Cubin, who are a &s;ort of People that will carry People where they plea&s;e for Money: the meane&s;t of all are the <HI>Batins</HI> and <HI>Zubies;</HI> The&s;e may not lay them down upon the Ground, but mu&s;t always have a Fan with them to lie in; Nor are they permitted to lie under any Roof. All their Women are obliged to go Naked all upwards upon pain of being whipt.</P>

<P>But it is to be ob&s;erved, That here are Diver&s;ity of Dialects, as in the &s;everal Provinces of other Coun|tries, and &s;o the Inland Cingularians differ from the Borderers; which makes <HI>Rob. Knox</HI> in his De&s;cription of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> give a different Account; and generally writes with an <HI>o,</HI> what I put down with an <HI>a;</HI> as <HI>Echoi, Dechoi, Tunhoi, Hutterhoi, Pauhhoi, Hoyhoi.</HI>
<PB N="273" REF="147">
Their Salutation is in the&s;e Words, <HI>Deo wardende Sacradende Neinde;</HI> and is an&s;wer'd with the &s;ame, both clapping their Hands to their Foreheads. <HI>Whither go you, Gaudi Januade. I don't know, Dut|wanetti. Fire, Genere. Water, Diwere.</HI> They write upon the Leaves of Sugar-Trees; when they read, it is with a very unplea&s;ant Accent, and very long Tone, as if they &s;ung. They write to each other on the&s;e Leaves, which are about an Ell long, and two Inches broad, and can fold them up &s;o artifici|ally, that none can open them, without di&s;covering that they have been open'd. They teach their Children to write upon the Sand or Ground with their Fingers. As to their Religion, they believe, That God, whom they call <HI>Deine,</HI> governs in Heaven, and that the Devil governs on Earth. Wherefore they Religiou&s;ly &s;erve him, giving him the Name of <HI>Jacie;</HI> and that not only by Offerings, and Songs in their Temples, but with Meetings in the Fields, under a &s;ort of Tree, which I cannot compare to any Tree &s;o well as a Lime-Tree. There is a Wall built round it of about half a Man's height; Here they Dance, Leap, and Sing, to his Honour: He comes to them in their Dance, and gives them An&s;wers to their Que&s;tions about things to Come: As whether it &s;hall be a plentiful Year, dry, or wet, and other things of this kind. The Sooth&s;ayer too, that receives the An&s;wer, hath great Honours paid him. But becau&s;e the Devil torments him too much, they are forced to carry him away home. They believe, That tho&s;e that Die are turn'd into a Bufflar, wherefore they give the Bufflars the name of <HI>Apetie,</HI> which &s;ignifies Father; and to the Cows, that of <HI>Amme,</HI> which &s;ignifies Mother.</P>
<P>When the mean illiterate People (who cannot Read) have a Child Born, the Father Plants a young <HI>Jacken</HI> or <HI>Jager-Tree</HI> by his Hou&s;e, by which he can reckon up the Child's Age. I have been at &s;ome of
<PB N="274" REF="148">
the&s;e Men's Hou&s;es to Buy Goods, and happen'd to ask the Age of &s;ome of their Children that came about me, and they &s;hew'd me a Tree, and told me, he was of the &s;ame Age with that. But they have there a Proverb, the cur&s;ed Allu&s;ion of which they verifie in earne&s;t, which is, That it is fit a Man &s;hould Eat the fir&s;t Fruits of the Trees they Plant; &s;o the Father always deflowers his Daughter as &s;oon as &s;he is come of Age.</P>
<P>They have a New-Year's Fe&s;tival, which la&s;ts &s;ix weeks, and begins about our <HI>Ea&s;ter.</HI> In the fir&s;t three weeks they wa&s;h them&s;elves every day; the other three weeks they pa&s;s away in Singing, and all kind of Mirth.</P>
<P>Their dwelling Hou&s;es are made according to the conveniency of the Country; &s;ome are near one another, after the manner of our Villages, which they call <HI>Aldeen.</HI> Others &s;tand by them&s;elves upon &s;ome ri&s;ing Ground, to be &s;ecure from the Water, which &s;ometimes ri&s;es very high, by rea&s;on of their great Rains: They are cover'd with Leaves of Trees. There is commonly but Room where they Eat and Lie, and another to Dre&s;s their Victuals in, which they be&s;mear every week with Bufflar's Grea&s;e, to free them&s;elves from Fleas and Pi&s;mires. Their Money they generally Bury in a Pot under the Hearth, or &s;ometimes under the Devil's Tree, in the Field, where it is Sacred.</P>
<P>Their Victuals is Rice boyl'd in&s;tead of Bread, and what they Eat with it, is made of all kinds of Herbs, Roots, Fruit, dry'd or fre&s;h Fi&s;h, which they Boil with a deal of green Pepper, or el&s;e with the Milk that comes from the Coco-Nuts. Every one takes his &s;hare of Rice upon a Fig-Leaf, (in&s;tead of a Plate) and takes his other Meat, and mixes it together with his Hand, and &s;o Eats it.</P>
<P>They wa&s;h their Hands and Mouths very clean before and after Meals. They chaw <HI>Betel</HI> all day
<PB N="275" REF="148">
which they prepare after this manner. They take one or two of the Leaves, about as broad as one's Hand, they call them <HI>Bular:</HI> They grow all round about, again&s;t Fruit-Trees, as Ivy does. Then they take &s;ome very fine Chalk, made of &s;mall Mu&s;&s;el|&s;hells burnt, and of it they &s;catter about as much as will lie on the top of a Knife over tho&s;e Leaves, and then rowl them up, and put into the middle a fourth part of an <HI>Arck,</HI> which is a Fruit like a Nutmeg; and to this Compo&s;ition they give the Name of <HI>Betel,</HI> which they keep continually in their Mouth: And this is to prevent the Scurvy. They Smoak Tobacco too, not out of Pipes, but wound up in a dry Leaf.</P>
<P>In their Trade, like other Nations, they love to Buy as cheap, and Sell as dear, as they can. They have no particular Traffick among&s;t them, dealing almo&s;t all in the &s;ame Goods. One thing which &s;eemed mighty &s;trange to me, was, That when I, or other Europeans came to Buy any &s;uch things, as Butter, Pepper, Sugar, Honey, Figs, Fowls, Rice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and ask'd them if they had any; they u&s;ed to &s;ay <HI>Netti,</HI> which is to &s;ay, <HI>No.</HI> So that we were forced to give them very good Words, and in&s;inu|ate our &s;elves into their favour, by giving their Children &s;ome Tobacco, or &s;ome little Trifle; Then they would ask their Children, even the &s;malle&s;t of 'em, whether they had be&s;t Sell any thing to the&s;e Per&s;ons; and according to their An&s;wer, they either &s;old to us, or refu&s;ed us, and would not have &s;old us any thing without their Con&s;ent, tho' we would have paid ten times the value of their Goods. When they had &s;old us any thing, and received their full Price, they would beg of us, that we would give them &s;ome of it again, tho' at the &s;ame time they were well &s;tock'd with the &s;ame Com|modity.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="149">
Theft, tho' but incon&s;iderable, is puni&s;hed with Death. All their King's Commands mu&s;t pun|ctually be ob&s;erved upon Pain of Death; and that not of the Per&s;on only that hath Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, but of his Kindred, to a third Generation. This King of <HI>Candi</HI> is a very cruel Tyrant. Some Europeans, that had been Pri&s;oners at his Court for above 20 years, have told me, That he had order'd no le&s;s than 300 in &s;ome years, to be drawn in pieces with Elephants, for a very &s;mall Fault, or &s;ometimes a meer Humour.</P>
<P>We will now give you &s;ome Account of their Military Exploits and Di&s;cipline. They have a Ge|neral, which they call <HI>Di&s;&s;ave;</HI> next to him &s;ome <HI>Saudis.</HI> Then the <HI>Araski,</HI> which are as Captains over 20 or 30 men each, with an En&s;ign. Their Artillery is only a &s;ort of Muskets, which &s;tand upon a frame with three Feet, of which the hind|mo&s;t is broad, and &s;horter than the two foremo&s;t: Having no Lead, they &s;hoot with Iron Bullets. The&s;e Muskets, the Nobility, which &s;erve the King, carry with 'em in fights.</P>
<P>They come into the Field, 30, 40, or 50000 &s;trong, all barefoot. Their Arms are a heavy Iron Cimiter about a yard long, and a light Half Pike. Few have Muskets or Fire-Locks; or if they have, they do little Execution with them; tho' they have never &s;o much room to draw up, yet they never advance but in &s;ingle Ranks, for fear the Hollanders &s;hould take too many of them off at once with their Field-Pieces. Their Drummers are very much de&s;pi&s;ed, being taken out of a &s;ort of People, (tho' <HI>Cingulaians</HI> too) that live upon Bufflars Fle&s;h, and the Fle&s;h of any kind of Bea&s;ts. They call them <HI>Borrowayen.</HI> They tie to their Body, two little &s;orts of Drums call'd <HI>Tamelins;</HI> others have but one of 'em, but then it is bigger. They beat di|&s;tinct Marches, with a great deal of Art, and the
<PB N="277" REF="149">
Soldiers under&s;tand them very well. They beat morning and night, but differently. Their Pipers u&s;e both a &s;traight and a crooked &s;ort of Pipe, and make pretty Mu&s;ick with them both together.</P>
<P>Any Dutchmen, that are taken by the&s;e People, are never to be Ran&s;om'd at any Rate; but mu&s;t remain among&s;t them in great Slavery all the days of their Life; and all the ways are &s;o &s;trictly guard|ed, that there is no e&s;caping by any means. The Dutch that &s;ometimes de&s;ert us, and go over to the King of <HI>Candi,</HI> are maintained in Nece&s;&s;aries, but are not tru&s;ted in any Employment.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of Inhabitants of this I&s;land, are tho&s;e of <HI>Gala Batacolo, Trinconomala, Jafnapatnam, Manara, Aripen, Calpintin,</HI> as far as <HI>Negombo;</HI> and are called <HI>Malabars.</HI> The&s;e are all very well &s;haped, and very black. They are all under the Govern|ment of the Hollanders, except tho&s;e of <HI>Wani,</HI> who have a King of their own. But he is obliged to pay to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company a yearly Tribute of ma|ny Elephants, and Money be&s;ides.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Malabars</HI> come originally from the Wild Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar,</HI> lying by <HI>Manara,</HI> and from the Kingdoms of the great <HI>Samerin, Calicut, Cananor,</HI> and others. They are all Infidels, and of different Opinions. Some of 'em, who are call'd <HI>Vitzliput|zli</HI> or <HI>Joo&s;ie,</HI> Wor&s;hip the Devil; others, a Ser|pent, a Crocodile, or an Elephant, and commonly what they plea&s;e them&s;elves. They neither Eat the Fle&s;h of Bufflars, nor Swine. They hire old Wo|men to Mourn over their Dead a whole night, and cry over the Corps all the time: <HI>Ajo aniate, ariate, inguwarre,</HI> which is as much as to &s;ay, Why did you Die, Come, come live again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Then they Bury him, and leave the Hutt out of which the Man died, and build another. They are a little more Civil than the <HI>Cingulaians,</HI> and their Dre&s;s is a lit|tle more comely. The Women never let them|&s;elves
<PB N="278" REF="150">
be &s;een uncovered by the Chri&s;tians. When they go abroad, they are all covered with white Linnen, and &s;o clo&s;e, that they can but ju&s;t &s;ee their way with the corner of one Eye: Their Arms and their Legs are all adorned with Silver Rings, and their Ears, about a Span long, with Gold: Their Fingers and Toes too are all richly &s;et out with &s;e|veral &s;orts of Rings, mo&s;t of Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>Their Numbers are; 1 <HI>Onera,</HI> 2 <HI>Renda,</HI> 3 <HI>Muna,</HI> 4 <HI>Nala,</HI> 5 <HI>An&s;e,</HI> 6 <HI>Ara,</HI> 7 <HI>Ola,</HI> 8 <HI>Orta,</HI> 9 <HI>Otta,</HI> 10 <HI>Padda,</HI> 11 <HI>Paddona,</HI> 12 <HI>Padda-renda,</HI> 13 <HI>Padda|muna,</HI> 14 <HI>Padda-nala,</HI> 15 <HI>Padda-an&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. The manner of their Salutation, is, Laying their Hand on their Forehead, and &s;aying <HI>Damrian Amadran,</HI> which is returned the &s;ame way. They write like|wi&s;e upon Leaves of Trees with an Iron-Pin, and make whole Books of 'em. We will now give you &s;ome Account, How the Hollanders came to Con|quer this Country, and make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>I have already told you, how it came to be in the Power of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and fortified by the Spaniards: It remained a great while in their Hands, till the Portugue&s;es Rebelling in <HI>Spain,</HI> cho&s;e a King to them&s;elves, with whom all the Spaniards that were in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> joyn'd. And thus the King of <HI>Spain</HI> lo&s;t all his Preten&s;ions in tho&s;e Countries, which was no &s;mall lo&s;s to him. The Portugue&s;es would be improving their Conque&s;ts, and try their Strength again&s;t the King of <HI>Candi,</HI> and thought by Fire and Sword, and their barbarous Slaughters and Murthers, to frighten him out of his Kingdom, but all in vain. For the King of <HI>Candi,</HI> finding him&s;elf in a great Extremity, call'd the Dutch to his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance; who together fell upon the Portugue&s;es, and became at length Ma&s;ters of all their Cities and Fortifications above-named. The la&s;t that was Be|&s;ieged by 'em, was the Capital City of <HI>Columbo,</HI> which is about 28 years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="150">
The King of <HI>Candi</HI> was now free, and had an Army of 50000 Men. The Dutch General on the other &s;ide, (call'd Min Heer <HI>&V;ander Hulft)</HI> had an Army of 12 Companies of 80 Men each, together with a Fleet of 8 Ships. Both the&s;e, tho' the one a Heathen, and the other a Chri&s;tian, agreed very well together, put things into very good Order, and made a Treaty; That when the City of <HI>Columbo,</HI> both the old and the new, &s;hould be taken, the King &s;hould have the Old one for his Re&s;idence, and the Fort <HI>Negombo,</HI> lying 8 Leagues from thence, towards the Kingdom of <HI>Candi,</HI> in his full Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion: The Dutch for their part &s;hould have the new City of <HI>Columbo</HI> without any Mole&s;tation, with all the other Forti&s;ications they were already po&s;&s;e&s;t of; and be&s;ides this, &s;hould have Priviledge to Trade in any part of the Kingdom what&s;oever with its Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Columbo</HI> being taken at la&s;t by the Dutch Admiral <HI>Ryclof &V;an Goens,</HI> (the above-men|tiou'd Heer <HI>&V;ander Hul&s;t</HI> being &s;hot Dead in the Trenches) and by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King's Forces, who did not &s;u&s;pect any Fal&s;hood after the Treaty made. The Heer <HI>&V;an Goens,</HI> having ga|ther'd together the King's Army under pretence of giving them a Treat, and the Streets being filled with them, he &s;ets all his own Men upon them, (for what Rea&s;on I cannot tell) who cut the be&s;t part of them in pieces, and put the re&s;t to flight. The King, whom they thought to have taken Pri|&s;oner, made his e&s;cape upon his Elephant, and got over high Mountains, Rocks, and Wilderne&s;&s;es, and at la&s;t into his Kingdom of <HI>Candi,</HI> where being &s;ecure, he &s;wore never to forget the Fal&s;hood and Treachery of the Chri&s;tians, but to continue in a perpetual War and Enmity again&s;t them.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Come now to give a &s;hort Account of the Wild and Tame Bea&s;ts that are in this I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon.</HI></P>
<P>Among the Wild ones, I will &s;peak fir&s;t of the Elephants. They are finer and more Docile than in other Countries. Therefore they catch a great many of 'em, which they make Tame, and fit for War, and &s;end them to the Kingdoms of <HI>Per&s;ia, Surrat,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> and &s;everal other places; and the Dutch them&s;elves make u&s;e of them in the Field.</P>
<P>I have been very curious in Searching into the Nature, Di&s;po&s;ition, and Qualities of the&s;e Ele|phants; and for that purpo&s;e conver&s;ed much with tho&s;e that Catch them, when they are young, and have my &s;elf help'd to catch 'em. I have found in them all a great deal of Cunning, and a good Me|mory, in which they &s;eem to be almo&s;t Rational
<PB N="282" REF="152">
Creatures. They never forget a Ma&s;ter's kind U&s;age; but that of a rough and cruel one, they on the other &s;ide, never leave unrevenged. They never Couple together in the &s;ight of Men, but fir&s;t they &s;earch round about the Wilderne&s;s to &s;ee if no Body is there hidden in any Tree to &s;py 'em; and if they find any, woe be to them. The Male hath his Te&s;ticles inwards, and the Female gives Suck between her fore Legs.</P>
<P>When they are Catch'd and Tame'd, they ne|ver Couple together. They carry their young ones &s;even years, and this has often been manife&s;t by the Wild She-Elephants that have been taken, and kept in the Stables which they have for 'em at <HI>Gala,</HI> and have brought forth their young at &s;even years end, after they were catcht. The young ones are, at fir&s;t, about the bigne&s;s of a Calf half a year old. They feed on Gra&s;s, Figs, Leaves, and Coco-Nuts, Rice, and other Fruits, and Bread if one gives it them. This they reach and hold fa&s;te with the end of their Trunk, and then thru&s;t it into their Mouths. Before they Eat any Gra&s;s, they throw it and to&s;s it about, to &s;hake out the Pi&s;mires, by which they are mightily tormented &s;ometimes. If the&s;e little Animals chance to get in their Trunk, they walk about there and tickle them intolerably.</P>
<P>Tho' they have no Hair, except on the Tail and Ears, yet they Swim very well. They'll live above 200 years, as has been &s;een in &s;ome who&s;e Age has been de&s;ignedly mark'd. They go together in the Woods &s;ome 8, 10, or 20 in a Company. They have a &s;ort of King, or Ma&s;ter-Elephant, which they follow; the young ones go in the middle. In the day time, they keep on the Mountains in the &s;hade, but towards the Dusk of the evening, they repair to the Meadows and Water-&s;ide. They break their way through the Boughs and Bu&s;hes with their Trunk; &s;o that by the Noi&s;e they make, one may
<PB N="283" REF="152">
hear them coming a Mile off. Then the Inhabi|tants, and the Keepers of the Fields, cry out to one another for help, to keep them out of their Grounds, where they de&s;troy all when they come. They holloe fir&s;t, <HI>Hu, Hu,</HI> and then they cry for help, <HI>Alia innuwate, The Elephants are a coming:</HI> Therefore, when they come near their Hutts, Or|chards, or Fields, they light Torches, which they have on purpo&s;e made of long dry Wood, and with this they drive them away, making a great deal of Shouting and Noi&s;e. Tho&s;e that watch the Fields of Rice, &s;it and &s;ing all night in a little Hutt rai&s;ed upon four Po&s;ts; and when they hear the Elephants coming, they holloe and light their Torches.</P>
<P>There is two different ways of Catching the Ele|phants. Among the <HI>Malabars,</HI> from <HI>Trinconomala</HI> to <HI>Batacale:</HI> There are &s;ome that Wor&s;hip the De|vil, by who&s;e help they Charm the&s;e Creatures, after having Sacrificed to him a Cock for an Offering. After they have Caught 'em with their Hands, they tie them with &s;trong Thongs of Bufflar's Leather, and Tame 'em: But neither the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> nor the <HI>Moors,</HI> care to Buy tho&s;e that are catch'd this way.</P>
<P>The other way of Catching them, is in a Pound prepared for that purpo&s;e, as I have &s;een one in the Kingdom of <HI>Cotta,</HI> two Leagues from <HI>Columbo,</HI> near the <HI>Aldee</HI> or Village <HI>Battalamuda:</HI> And I have been my &s;elf at the Catching of 50 of them, young and old; which is done thus.</P>
<P>When the Inhabitants have notice where they are, and what place they frequent mo&s;t, the Governour of <HI>Columbo</HI> gives a general Order for a Hunting Day; on which every body high and low, even the Nobles them&s;elves, meet at the appointed place: Be&s;ides this, the Governour takes all the Soldiers, Drums, and Burghers, along with him; being all met, they &s;pread them&s;elves in a Wing a League or two long.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="153">
Thus they go holloing and &s;hooting along the whole day, thro' Woods and over Mountains: At Night they re&s;t, and for fear the Elephants &s;hould get out back again, they light Fires all along about a Stone's throw from each other, which the Ele|phants are very much afraid of. The next day they go on again, and draw the Elephant's into a narrower compa&s;s. If any of 'em offer to go back, and break through, they fright them with Drums, and &s;hooting and holloing. If one of them &s;hould chance to break through, all the re&s;t would inevi|tably follow. When all the Hunters have in 3 or 4 weeks time ranged over 20 or 30 miles Ground, the&s;e Wild Elephants are at length, by the means of Tame ones that &s;erve to decoy them drove into the Pound, which we mention'd above. Then they tie a Wild one to a Tame one, or if it is a very lu&s;ty one, between two. Then they make 'em &s;o Tame by giving them neither Meat nor Drink, that with a certain In&s;trument they u&s;e, a Child may manage them. Notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome which they can never Ma&s;ter, and tho&s;e they turn out again to Breed and Increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ea&s;t-Indian Kings and Merchants buy the Elephants by their height, which they mea&s;ure to an Inch (as we do Hor&s;es here) from the Ground to the ridge of the Back. According to their height, they are worth 7, 8, 900 or 1000 Rixdol|lars. Sometimes they Buy them (when they are of an extraordinary va&s;t Bulk) for &s;hew. Otherwi&s;e they u&s;e 'em in War, and to draw the Baggage, and great Artillery. The <HI>Great Mogul</HI> hath fre|quently with him 4 or 500 in the Field; And we u&s;ed them in all Expeditions: Each Company had an Elephant, as we &s;hall tell more largely hereafter.</P>
<P>The two Teeth that &s;tick bending &s;o long out of their Mouth, are &s;ufficiently known by the Name of Elephant's Teeth. The Fle&s;h of Elephants is
<PB N="285" REF="153">
not fit to Eat, and their Hides are made no u&s;e of, by rea&s;on of their wanting Men to dre&s;s and pre|pare them. They are extream thick. The Fle&s;h is Spungy, and Rotts in two or three days. The Hair that grows upon the Tail they hold very good again&s;t the Cramp, and as an approved Remedy they wear it made up in Rings on their Fingers.</P>
<P>When they are to draw a Load, they go &s;ide long and look &s;teadily upon the Waggon, to &s;ee that no Body lays any thing more upon't than what is u&s;ual; and if one doth, they will not wag a foot further till it be taken off again: But what is more &s;trange then that, is, what I have often &s;een at <HI>Columbo</HI> and <HI>Jafnapatnam,</HI> That the&s;e Elephants when they were drawing a Load of Stones for the Fortifications, would &s;tand &s;tock &s;till at 11 a Clock, which is the Dinner time allowed to all the Slaves and Workmen, and would not draw an Inch further, tho' they were ju&s;t at the place, and the Drivers encouraged 'em never &s;o much.</P>
<P>There is great &s;tore of Bufflars in <HI>Ceylon,</HI> e&s;pe|cially in and about <HI>Calpintin.</HI> They are about the bigne&s;s of a Podolian or Hungarian Ox, but &s;tronger. Their Horns are about two yards long: They are of an a&s;h-colour. In the day time they lie in the Water up to their No&s;e, and at night they come to Graze in the Meadows. Their Fle&s;h is Eatable, when it hath lain 2 or 3 days in Salt; but very hot, and gives the Bloody-Flux to mo&s;t People that Eat of it. They are very dangerous to go near, e&s;pecially to the Europeans, and chiefly if they have any young ones by them.</P>
<P>Tygers are here al&s;o in abundance, and very per|nicious to Man and Bea&s;t, and particularly to Stags and Deer. They are about the bigne&s;s of a large A&s;s, but &s;omething longer; they are &s;potted with yellowi&s;h and whiti&s;h &s;pots, and in their Make ex|actly like a Cat. Their Fle&s;h is white, and many
<PB N="286" REF="154">
People Eat of it. Their Skins &s;erve to make Belts, Hol&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and are much u&s;ed for covering of Trunks and Boxes. They have &s;o much of the Scent of Musk, that the Hunt&s;men, if they take the Wind right, will &s;ind them out by it, and &s;o in their pur&s;uit of other Bea&s;ts, avoid them.</P>
<P>Bears are likewi&s;e found here in &s;everal Parts, and are dangerous Creatures: Yet they are not &s;o much fear'd here, as the Wolves are in <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Jackalls are of &s;hape and bigne&s;s like a Fox, only a &s;harper Snout: They keep all day in their Dens, and at night they gather together a hun|dred of them or more, and come to the out&s;ide of the City of <HI>Columbo,</HI> in que&s;t of Dead Bodies, and fall &s;ometimes upon a Man, if they chance to find him a&s;leep.</P>
<P>There is a &s;ort of Creature here, that is not very well known, becau&s;e it is rare; it is called <HI>Bit&s;che Vergunie,</HI> and by the Dutch, <HI>The Devil of Negombo,</HI> which Name they have given it, becau&s;e of its Qualities, as I am going to tell you, and be|cau&s;e they are mo&s;t frequently about <HI>Negombo.</HI> It is about a yard high, and three yards long. It hath a &s;harp Snout, and very &s;harp Teeth. The Body is as it were Harna&s;s'd over with thick round yellow Shells. When it is pur&s;ued, it can winde it &s;elf up into a Ball. At night it makes &s;uch a di&s;|mal frightful Noi&s;e, that it hath often &s;car'd the Centinels from their Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lewer</HI> is another, called by the Dutch, <HI>Lui&s;te Dier;</HI> i. e. Slow-Bea&s;t. The&s;e Bea&s;ts are made like an Ape, with Hands and Feet, look very gha&s;tly, and as lean as a Skeleton, wonderful &s;low in their Eating, Drinking, and Going; tho' Dogs, or any Wild Bea&s;ts come towards 'em, they will not ha&s;ten their pace in the lea&s;t; and when they come near 'em, they turn them&s;elves to 'em, and with their glaring Eyes, fright away the fierce&s;t Dog that
<PB N="287" REF="154">
can be. Their Eyes &s;tand quite out of their Heads, and appear very terrible: When Men come after 'em, they do the &s;ame: But it hath not the &s;ame Effect, for Men have a Snare, which they clap on their hinder parts, and &s;o catch them as they do Monkies. After they are catch'd, they are &s;till &s;low as before, and would not go above a League in a day, if one left 'em to them&s;elves. They are kept in Cities for a Rarity, but they are too ten|der to tran&s;port into other Countries.</P>
<P><HI>Wandura</HI> or Apes are here in abundance; they are black, excepting a whiti&s;h Ring about the hin|der part of the Body, and a great gray Beard, which makes them look very much like &s;ome of the Old Cingulayans. They are about the bigne&s;s of a Ma&s;tiff, and have a very long Tail. They skip about the Woods from Tree to Tree, making a great noi&s;e, their young ones hanging all the while about 'em. If you &s;hoot 'em, the young ones fall with 'em, and then you take 'em off to keep and breed up: But this is not a true kind of Ape for keeping, &s;o that few People take the trouble to Catch them; for they do not take any thing that's taught 'em, as others will. If a &s;hot wounds them &s;o as to fetch out a part of their Guts, they work out the re&s;t with both their Hands, (if I may &s;o call 'em) and &s;o fall down. Tho&s;e that are Catch'd will never Couple together, tho' one keeps them ever &s;o long.</P>
<P>Wild-Cats; there are of two &s;orts: One of which is as large as our common Hou&s;e-Cats, and live upon all &s;orts of Fowl. The other is as &s;mall as our Squirrels, and are called Suri-Cats; becau&s;e they keep about the Coco-Trees, whence the <HI>Suri</HI> comes. Their Hair is of a grey colour; and they make a noi&s;e like a young Turkey.</P>
<P>Stags are bigger than the Stags in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>Deer, are &s;omewhat le&s;s, and full of white &s;pots.</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="155">
Wild-Goats are a little bigger than our Hares.</P>
<P>The Hares le&s;s than with us.</P>
<P>Wild-Boars here as in <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e are in va&s;t numbers, becau&s;e but few People Hunt 'em; there being &s;o great a quantity of Wild-Bea&s;ts there that are better.</P>
<P>Wild-Hor&s;es are very plentyful in the I&s;le of <HI>Ma|nara,</HI> and not far from thence in another I&s;le towards <HI>Jafnapatnam;</HI> but they are le&s;s than our Hor&s;es in <HI>Holland.</HI> Sometimes they catch &s;ome of the fine&s;t of 'em, which they Break for the Saddle, or el&s;e they u&s;e 'em for Carts and Waggons.</P>
<P>Among the Tame Bea&s;ts and Cattle, Oxen and Cows are in &s;o great plenty, that one of 'em is not worth above two or three Gulders.</P>
<P>Bufflars are in abundance; the Country Fellows u&s;e them in their Rice-Fields: One of them is worth three or four Gulders.</P>
<P>Three &s;orts of Sheep there are among&s;t 'em; one which comes out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which for Wool, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are like tho&s;e in <HI>Holland,</HI> excepting that their Tails are &s;o va&s;tly big, that &s;ome of 'em will weigh 20 or 25 Pound: Another &s;ort comes out of <HI>Africa,</HI> with Horns about a Span long, but no Wool, only Hair like Calves: A third &s;ort hath Wool like the fir&s;t, but very long Ears.</P>
<P>Goats are in good &s;tore here, and Swine, &s;uch as in <HI>Holland.</HI> One of the bigge&s;t and fatte&s;t in the I&s;land <HI>Manara</HI> is not worth above a Rixdollar.</P>
<P>Now for the Wild-Fowl. There are Peacocks of the &s;ame colour as here; and be&s;ides tho&s;e, there are many as white as Swans.</P>
<P>Wild-Cocks and Hens are about the bigne&s;s of ours.</P>
<P>Water-Fowl, Snipes, Stock-Doves, and others. Two &s;ort of Herons, one of 'em blui&s;h, the other half black. Gee&s;e and Ducks in great numbers. I will not make any mention of their &s;mall Birds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="289" REF="155">
I will only give you &s;ome Account of the Parrots, which are here of three &s;orts. The large&s;t are of a green colour, mixt with blue and red, with a black Ring round the Neck, and are accounted the be&s;t. A le&s;&s;er &s;ize there is, all green, with a red Ring round the Neck, which is but little valued; and a le&s;s than that which is le&s;s e&s;teemed too, be|cau&s;e it is the lea&s;t docile. They Eat Rice and Figs. They are be&s;t to be taught when they are young. They are tied to a Cord or Chain, and morning and night, while it is duski&s;h, one talks to 'em half an hour or thereabouts, till they get 'em at la&s;t to &s;peak any thing after them.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a great many Birds of Prey; as Falcons, Hawks, and Ravens, with a white Ring about their Neck.</P>
<P>Batts are of two &s;orts; the one &s;mall as ours here, that fly by night; and the other as big as tho&s;e I have &s;poken of in <HI>Java.</HI></P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of Bird, which is call'd, a <HI>Navi,</HI> (becau&s;e it makes a noi&s;e which &s;ounds like that word) which when the Portugue&s;es hear, they expect the arrival of &s;ome Ships in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>They have but few Gee&s;e, except &s;uch as are brought hither from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope;</HI> they have a Bunch growing on their Bill: They co&s;t a Rixdollar a-piece.</P>
<P>Other Tame Fowl is there in &s;uch plenty, that one may Buy a Pullet for a Peny, and 40, 50, or 60 Eggs for the &s;ame price. Ducks that lay 200 or 300 Eggs after one another, without one days inter|mi&s;&s;ion, will co&s;t but Two Pence or Two Pence half peny. Many keep Pigeons likewi&s;e, which come from <HI>Holland,</HI> which they Buy for 10 d. a pair.</P>
<P>Among the four-footed Animals, in the Rivers; There is the Crocodile which devours many Men that live near them, as they are Fi&s;hing, Wa&s;hing, or Bathing them&s;elves, if they do not take an e&s;pe|cial
<PB N="290" REF="156">
Care: But I will in &s;hort de&s;cribe &s;omething of the Nature of them.</P>
<P>The Crocodile is not &s;o very furious as &s;ome Peo|ple imagine. He &s;eeks his Prey alone; but when he is hungry, he Devours any living thing he can Eat, whether Man, Fi&s;h, Bea&s;t, Dogs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;hews him|&s;elf commonly, and &s;wims any part of the day at the top of the Water, like a piece of Timber. He &s;ets open his Mouth for a certain Bird to pick his Teeth with his Bill, which is about the length of one's Finger. At night he comes upon Land to &s;eek out for Meat. The&s;e Animals lay their Eggs upon the bare Sand, and leave the Sun to produce the young ones out of 'em, who as &s;oon as they come out, are about half a yard long; The Egg it &s;elf is about twice as big as that of a Goo&s;e. They con|tinually keep growing as long as they live, and come to be &s;ome 20, &s;ome 25, &s;ome 30 foot long: The Body is armed all over with a thick Scale: Their Teeth are exceeding &s;harp; and &s;o much &s;trength is in their Tail, that they'll kill any Fi&s;h or other Animal with a blow of it. Upon Land they can run fa&s;ter than mo&s;t Men; but in a &s;hort turning, a Man may have the Advantage of 'em, becau&s;e they mu&s;t take a great compa&s;s; and being &s;o long and thick, without any bending in their Backs, they are forced to take a large turn, which affords a Man fair time to e&s;cape out of their reach.</P>
<P>Here is another &s;ort of Bea&s;t, much like the Cro|codile, which is call'd a <HI>Caprigoy;</HI> but it hath nei|ther Shells, nor Scales on it, and its Tongue is very long and pointed. The longe&s;t I ever &s;aw of the&s;e was not above ten foot.</P>
<P>Another not much unlike this, but le&s;s yet, call'd a <HI>Leguwan,</HI> the Fle&s;h of which many People Eat.</P>
<P>Now of Serpents there are &s;everal &s;orts; one of 'em is called <HI>Worgers,</HI> they are 10 or 15 foot long. They will &s;eize a Man, and cla&s;p them&s;elves round
<PB N="291" REF="156">
about him, and &s;queeze him &s;o that he can't Breath, and falls down Dead: And to be arm'd again&s;t the&s;e, no Man goes abroad without a good Knife about him, to cut them in two, which makes them let go their hold quickly.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort, which is called, <HI>Chapel-Snakes,</HI> be|cau&s;e they keep in Chapels or Churches, and &s;ometimes in Hou&s;es; The&s;e are very mi&s;chievous and venomous, and without a timely Antidote, they who are bit by them, die Infallibly. They are com|monly from 4 to 6 foot long; and they have a &s;ort of Bladder, or &s;pot of white, which &s;hews it &s;elf on the top of their Head when they are vex'd.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of 'em, which they call <HI>Rat-Catchers,</HI> which are not &s;o dangerous. They live all in Hou&s;es, and de&s;troy the Rats and Mice as much as any Cats would. They are nine or ten foot long, and will never hurt any Body unle&s;s one Angers them.</P>
<P>The Green Serpents keep upon the Trees, and when any Man or Bea&s;t comes near them, they dart them&s;elves upon them, and with their &s;harp Tongues endeavour to put out their Eyes. They are about two yards long. The mo&s;t poi&s;onous of all, are, the two headed ones, which have a Head at each end.</P>
<P>Here are two &s;orts of Remedies again&s;t the Poi|&s;on of tho&s;e Animals: The one, which the Inha|bitants u&s;e frequently, is Witchcraft: The other, which I have often u&s;ed, is a Serpent-Stone. This Stone is laid upon the Wound, and it &s;ticks to it, till it hath drawn to it &s;elf all the Venom out of it. When it is come off, it is thrown into new Milk, which fetcheth all the Poi&s;on out of the Stone, and grows black and blue with it: Then the Stone is applied afre&s;h to the Wound, and if there be any Poi&s;on remaining, it &s;ticks on, if not, it falls off, and the Per&s;on is &s;ecure.</P>

I have &s;een many Scorpions here as big as a common Crab, but their Stings are not dangerous, and cau&s;e only a &s;marting for two days, and never prove mortal.</P>
<P>The Hundred-Feet called by the Portugue&s;es <HI>Cente-Pe,</HI> becau&s;e it hath a Hundred-Feet, is about half a yard long, and hath two Horns wherewith it Pinches. It is &s;o full of Venom, that it is all over of a blew and yellow colour with it; if one is pinched by 'em, it may prove very dangerous, be|&s;ides the cruel Smart it cau&s;es, unle&s;s the place is anointed quickly with Oil of Coco's.</P>
<P>There are three &s;orts of Pi&s;mires, red, black, and white. The fir&s;t are the bigge&s;t, and rid the Hou&s;es of other Vermine, as Rats, Mice, and Ser|pents. The black keep in the Fields; if they touch a Man's Skin, they make it Smart for about half an hour. The white ones live among&s;t Hou&s;hold Goods; they Eat through Che&s;ts and Trunks, and damage Cloaths and Linnen very much.</P>
<P>Fleas are here in Shoals, &s;o that Men could not have any re&s;t, if they did not be&s;mear all their Hou&s;es with Cow-Dung, to keep them away.</P>
<P>The Air is full of little Flies and Gnats; and in &s;ome places People cannot Eat for 'em, but are forced to &s;tay till night when they are &s;ettled.</P>
<P>Blood-Suckers, or Leeches, are the wor&s;t Ver|mine on the I&s;land: They are mo&s;t towards the North between <HI>Candi</HI> and <HI>Columbo.</HI> There are of two &s;orts of 'em, the great and the &s;mall; The fir&s;t are the common Plagues of Bufflers: The other of Men. They keep in the Water, and are made much like our Hedge-Hogs. When any Man or Bea&s;t goes into the Water, they hang upon him till they have &s;uckt their fill, and &s;well three times as big as they were at fir&s;t, then they fall off. If one goes to &s;trike them off, immediately they break off and leave the Head in the Fle&s;h, which makes the
<PB N="293" REF="157">
Wound the more dangerous: But the be&s;t way to deal with 'em is to have &s;ome green Lemons with one, or good Vinegar and Salt or Salt-Petre, and wet them with it, and they fall off immediately.</P>
<P>The &s;mall &s;ort are about the bigne&s;s of a Straw, and about three Inches in length, and of a brown colour. They have neither Eyes nor Feet. In dry Weather they are &s;eldom to be &s;een; but after &s;ome Rain, they fill the Ways and Shrubs. They do not creep as Worms do, but rai&s;e them&s;elves up an end, and throw them&s;elves upwards. If they lay hold of a Man they are not ea&s;ily got off again, nor with|out great danger. Some <HI>Cingulayans</HI> &s;ay, That the&s;e things were fir&s;t brought over into this Country by the contrivance of one <HI>Lamammea,</HI> one of the Kings of <HI>Candi</HI>'s Si&s;ter, (who&s;e Brother the Portugue&s;es had taken away by violence) to be a Plague to them, but how much truth there is in the Story, I leave the Reader to judge.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Sea-Fi&s;h commonly catch'd here, I place the Sword-Fi&s;h; it is from 8 to 12 foot in length: It is called by that Name from a &s;ort of Sword it hath upon his No&s;e, which is like a Saw, with about 50 Teeth about the bigne&s;s of one's Fin|ger. The bigge&s;t of tho&s;e Swords that I ever &s;aw was an Ell long. The Fle&s;h of this Fi&s;h is fit to Eat, but the younger the Fi&s;h is, the better. The&s;e Sword-Fi&s;hes are not of that &s;ort which are &s;o great Enemies to Whales, for they never come &s;o far into the North, it being too Cold for them there: Be|&s;ides, tho&s;e that &s;ight with the Whales have their Sword on their Back, and keep about <HI>Greenland</HI> and <HI>Y&s;land</HI> in va&s;t numbers.</P>
<P>Sharks are right Sea-Wolves, and devour the Men they can catch, but they are often catch'd and devour'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Sail-Fi&s;h, &s;o called, becau&s;e it hath a large Finn, which &s;tands upon the Back of it above Water,
<PB N="294" REF="158">
and lets the Wind drive it forwards; hath a &s;harp long Head of about an Ell long, and his Body is twice as long again: tho' its Fle&s;h is but cour&s;e, yet a great many People Eat it.</P>
<P>There is a Fi&s;h which they call <HI>Oan-Egbert&s;en</HI> half an Ell long, and very full of Blood. They are in &s;o great plenty, that they pull up 7, 8, or 900 at one Draught. The great time of Fi&s;hing for 'em is in <HI>February,</HI> at which time not the Fi&s;h only is very cheap, but all &s;orts of Meat and other Victuals are at very low Rates.</P>
<P>The St. <HI>Peter's Fi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Five Finger-Fi&s;h,</HI> is called by &s;ome the <HI>Leather-Fi&s;h,</HI> by rea&s;on of the thickne&s;s of his Skin; Hath five white &s;treaks on the Back in the &s;hape of a Man's Fingers; it is about two yards in length, and very good to Eat: It is mo&s;t in &s;ea|&s;on in <HI>March,</HI> and then they catch likely 2 or 300 of them at once. The old Portugue&s;es will tell you that this mark on the Back came by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> who drew up one of them in his Net, and left the figure of his Fingers upon it. But this I leave the Reader to believe at Di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Jacks are here of the &s;ame kind as in <HI>Holland,</HI> one, two, or three yards in length, and are to be catch'd with Angles in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The King's Fi&s;h is the be&s;t &s;ort that is here, and is &s;omething like our Carps.</P>
<P>Cablins are like our Herrings, but a little broader, there is va&s;t plenty of 'em, and one Buys 10 or 20, &s;ometimes 40, for a Peny.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sertin</HI> is a &s;mall lean Fi&s;h. They catch &s;ome thou&s;ands of them at one Draught, becau&s;e they go together in Shoals.</P>
<P>Sea-Swine or Sea-Hogs, are catcht here in great numbers; their length is five or &s;ix yards, and half that about: They have a &s;harp Snout like ordinary Hogs; The Fle&s;h of 'em is very fat, and the Blood very hot: In the Water they out-&s;wim all other Fi&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="158">
Sea-Devils or Sand-Creepers are 5 or 6 yards long, with a frightful Head, very broad, but not thick, black at top, and white underneath. There is much difficulty in catching of 'em with Angles, becau&s;e they lie 15 or 20 Fathoms deep.</P>
<P>Scaits are round and flat: Have their Eyes in their Body, and a thin flat Tail about two Yards long; they are very good to Eat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Piil-Staert,</HI> as they call it, (which &s;igni&s;ies <HI>Arrow-Tail)</HI> is much like it; it is as good to Eat too: But the Tail is of that Nature, that if he wounds a Man with it, 'tis mortal to him: Wherefore great Care is taken to cut that off as &s;oon as they have catch'd 'em.</P>
<P>Tortoi&s;es, are catch'd here of 200 pound weight. They lay their Eggs on the Sand, 200 at a time, and leave them to the Sun to hatch; they have no Shell, only are cover'd with a Tough Skin. When they come upon Land, the Indians turn them over on their Backs, from which they cannot ri&s;e again, having not the command of their Legs. When they have them thus, three or four Men carry them to Market, and there cut them out. The Shells of the&s;e very large ones are not u&s;eful, but the &s;mall ones are of great u&s;e for inlaid Work, Combs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sea-Crabs, and Sea-Lob&s;ters: The&s;e are here a Yard long, with large Claws; and the other round with a very hard Shell.</P>
<P>Sea-Lice, are made like Lice, cover'd over with a white Shell, about the bigne&s;s of a Walnut. They keep in the wet Sand on the Shore, and are Eaten only by the <HI>Malabarian</HI> Fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P>Mu&s;cles &s;tick to the Rocks, and when the Sea is at Ebb, they pick them up.</P>
<P>The manner of Fi&s;hing, which the <HI>Malabarians</HI> u&s;e, is much like ours. Their Nets are exceeding long, &s;o as to reach about half a mile in compa&s;s,
<PB N="296" REF="159">
and are buoy'd up with Wood in&s;tead of Cork; and in the middle of it, which comes la&s;t to &s;hore, they have a great Bag, into which the Fi&s;h is all driven.</P>
<P>Fre&s;h River-Fi&s;h are the&s;e: The St. <HI>Pilang,</HI> a Fi&s;h with a broad Head, as &s;mooth as an Eel, about a yard long, and two Spans about. The <HI>Bald-Head</HI> is a better &s;ort of Fi&s;h, all Scaly like a Carp, ex|cepting the Head; weighs generally 7 or 8 pound. A Fi&s;h called a <HI>Fool,</HI> becau&s;e whoever Eats any thing of the Head, becomes &s;tupid: Wherefore the Head is always thrown away, the re&s;t is very good to Eat. The <HI>Pager</HI> is a black Fi&s;h, with a hard thick Head; its Body is round, with very &s;harp Finns.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Year in <HI>Ceylon</HI> is divided into two Sea&s;ons only. Great Floods there during one of the Sea&s;ons. An Account of <HI>Caudingelle,</HI> a Fort built and for&s;aken by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> much annoyed by the King of <HI>Candi</HI>'s Men. The Author is ordered to <HI>Anguratot;</HI> De|&s;cription of that Place; how the <HI>Europeans</HI> live there with <HI>Cingulai&s;h</HI> Women. He goes back to <HI>Columbo;</HI> one of the Boats is lo&s;t by the way. He lives a while there with one of the Council. Is &s;ent to <HI>Malvane,</HI> an unhealthy Place, which the King of <HI>Candi</HI> Be&s;ieges with <HI>30000</HI> Men, but his General comes over to the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Candi</HI> runs away from <HI>Co|lumbo,</HI> where he had been kept a long while, and for what Rea&s;on. The Author with two Companies of Voluntiers are &s;ent out, and in their March &s;uffered much Thir&s;t, and went all Bare-foot. They come to <HI>Calpintin, Aripen, Manaca, Jafnapatnam;</HI> all which Places he gives a De&s;cription of. Then he goes to <HI>Porto Novo,</HI> where he hath two Arrows &s;hot in him. He goes back to <HI>Columbo,</HI> where he is Cured.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE whole Year is divided into two Sea&s;ons only, call'd the <HI>good</HI> and the <HI>bad</HI> Sea&s;on. Each of them con&s;i&s;ts of five Months; the other two are call'd the Dubious Months, being <HI>March</HI> and <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> in which are the two <HI>Sol&s;tices,</HI> on the <HI>12th</HI> Old Stile, or <HI>22d</HI> New Stile, of each of tho&s;e Months.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>March,</HI> the Rains begin to fall on that &s;ide on which <HI>Columbo</HI> is Situated, and con|tinue mo&s;t commonly to the Month of <HI>September;</HI> &s;o that all the Rivers overflow the Countries in &s;uch a manner, that the People, Cattle and Wild-Bea&s;ts
<PB N="298" REF="160">
are &s;urrounded on a &s;udden, and carried away by the Water-floods. Tho&s;e that delight in Hunting, may find great quantities of Bea&s;ts forced up into the Mountains at that time.</P>
<P>In <HI>September</HI> it begins to hold up, and the Wea|ther is much like what we u&s;e to have in <HI>April,</HI> in <HI>Holland:</HI> Then the Sun-beams come to be &s;o vio|lently hot, that it dries up &s;ometimes Navigable Rivers, and then the Wild-Bea&s;ts are forced to run a va&s;t way to get Water.</P>
<P>In this <HI>good Sea&s;on</HI> (as they term it) Thunder and Lightning are very frequent, and to that degree, that many huge Trees are &s;plit and rent to pieces with it. The <HI>Sun</HI> doth not move far from this Place, wherefore little notice can be taken of the lengthning or &s;hortning of the Days: Nor is it ever very cold here; only when the North Wind begins to blow in <HI>February,</HI> and which holds on for about four Months, one may bear a cotton Garment on. In this Sea&s;on, the Fi&s;hermen have &s;eldom the oppor|tunity of Fi&s;hing, by rea&s;on of the roughne&s;s of the Sea. Whil&s;t the <HI>good</HI> Sea&s;on is on that &s;ide of <HI>Co|lumbo,</HI> the other &s;ide towards <HI>Cormandel, Jafnapatnam, Manara, Batacolo, &amp;c.</HI> have the <HI>bad</HI> with them, which is not a little &s;trange, con&s;idering that they are not far from one another.</P>
<P>I was upon Duty in the Fort <HI>Galture,</HI> where our Men work'd by Day on the Fortifications, and at Night &s;tood Sentinels, (the Night la&s;ting but two Hours) from the <HI>22d</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1677, till the la&s;t of <HI>September</HI> of the &s;ame Year. Our head Officer there was a Lieutenant, one <HI>Adam Slecht,</HI> a <HI>Bohemian.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>1&s;t</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> we were order'd by our Governor to march to a Forlorn Fort, call'd <HI>Candin|gelle,</HI> &s;ix Leagues from <HI>Galture,</HI> with 40 <HI>Europeans,</HI> and 200 <HI>La&s;carins,</HI> or <HI>Cingulai&s;h</HI> Soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="160">
A very hard Storm fell upon us in the way, which &s;o &s;welled the Waters about us, that we were forced to wade with our Cloaths tuck'd up, and we were not a little plagued with the <HI>Blood-&s;uckers.</HI> We found the &s;aid Fort overgrown with Trees and Shrubs, and no Inhabitants within two Leagues of it; they were all retir'd up into the high Moun|tains, becau&s;e tho&s;e of <HI>Candi</HI> continually made In|cur&s;ions upon that &s;ide of the Country, Spoiling, Burning and De&s;troying all they came near. The Hollanders had built this Fort &s;ome Years &s;ince; but having not made it &s;trong enough, and pro|vided it with nece&s;&s;aries &s;ufficient, they were forc'd to leave it. It takes up about two Acres of Land; it hath four Ba&s;tions, a Parapet, and Palli&s;ado's as high as a Pike, and as thick as a Man's middle. We Europeans were po&s;ted within, and the Cingulai|ans on the outward Works; and were forc'd to cut up all the Wood about it, within a Mu&s;quet|&s;hot.</P>
<P>We were in no danger in the day-time, but we had enough to do at night with &s;everal Parties of Candians, and with Elephants too: But the&s;e we frightned away ea&s;ily with the Fires we made, ha|ving good &s;tore of Wood. Our Magazine was &s;tor'd with Salt, Rice, Bacon, Fle&s;h, Brandy, Pow|der and Shot, all which we had from <HI>Anguratot,</HI> two Leagues di&s;tant from us; and the care of it was gi|ven to me. Our Water was fetch'd about a Pi&s;tol|&s;hot from the Fort.</P>
<P>After we had lain here eight days in this wild and de&s;ert place, the Candians came again&s;t us, Headed by <HI>Di&s;&s;ave Tennecool,</HI> the great Robber: An <HI>Arat&s;i</HI> of ours brought us intelligence that they were coming with great forces upon us. We found then it was high time to remove our Quarters, which we did, &s;etting all on Fire, and retired to another place near to <HI>Anguratot.</HI> By an order &s;ent
<PB N="300" REF="161">
us from <HI>Columbo,</HI> we were oblig'd to go back to our old Quarters at <HI>Galture.</HI></P>
<P>The 12th of October I was &s;ent to <HI>Anguratot</HI> to re&s;ide as Ma&s;ter of the Stores, and Pay-ma&s;ter of the Forces. I was made mighty welcome by our chief Dutch-Officer, who lay there; and by Mr. <HI>Bu&s;terweld,</HI> who was the En&s;ign there. He was a Man that had been employ'd in great Affairs here, and had been &s;ent as an Envoy to the King of <HI>Candi.</HI> He invited me to &s;tay with him and make my a|bode at his Hou&s;e to keep him company, that be|ing together we might &s;pend our time more agrea|bly.</P>
<P>I was well enough pleas'd to be at <HI>Anguratot,</HI> becau&s;e it was very &s;trong, and well provided with Cannon. A very fine River runs before it, which comes from <HI>Saffrigam,</HI> and hath great &s;tore of good Fi&s;h, and Tortoi&s;es; and we had &s;ome thou&s;ands of Inhabitants about us, of whom we bought choice Fruits very cheap, and all other &s;orts of Victuals, as Fowls, Butter, Honey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for a very &s;mall price. It is very plea&s;ant living here for one that can &s;peak the Cingulai&s;h Language.</P>
<P>The Europeans that live here, who are not above Forty or Fifty in number, live live in this following manner. They have Prayers every day, morning and night, and a Sermon on Sundays, with Singing of P&s;alms. They watch, and are free by turns in the day-time, but at night they mu&s;t all be in the Fort upon pain of Death. Out of the Fort ev'ry one hath his little Hou&s;e, where each of them keeps his Cingulayi&s;h Woman to provide and dre&s;s his Victuals, and &s;erves likewi&s;e for his Bedfellow. If a Woman at any time is brought to Bed of a White Child, it is matter of great Joy to the Pa|rents and Relations, and they grow very proud upon it. If a Man de&s;ign to go out of the Coun|try, he mu&s;t keep it exceeding private; for if his
<PB N="301" REF="161">
Bedfellow knows any thing of it before-hand, &s;he certainly poi&s;ons him, or bewitches him, as &s;eve|ral have been &s;erv'd that have gone away; and tho' they were got 2 or 3000 miles, yet they were forc'd to come back again.</P>
<P>On the la&s;t day of December, a Letter came to Mr. <HI>Bu&s;terweld</HI> from <HI>Columbo,</HI> advi&s;ing him to come thither, &s;eeing he had a mind to go back into his Country. He ask'd me if I would not go with him to <HI>Columbo:</HI> So I accompany'd him thither, and we gave orders for three Boats to be made rea|dy for our &s;elves and our Baggage.</P>
<P>The 2d of January, 1678; Early in the morning we went out of <HI>Anguratot,</HI> and order'd the Cingu|layans (of which there were four in each of our Boats) to take a great deal of care, for we were to pa&s;s thro' two &s;everal places that were very full of Rocks. The Dutch call the one of them, The Great Hell; the other, The Little Hell, becau&s;e they &s;wallow up &s;o many Men. We &s;ent out be|fore in a Boat that went free, and old Fellow (a Cin|gulayan, who was mo&s;t experienc'd) to &s;hew us the way. The Boat was loaded with Rice and Fowls, but the Men not Rowing &s;o &s;trong as they &s;hould have done, all &s;unk with their Boat. We that came ju&s;t after them were not a little &s;tartled. I encouraged the Men in my Boat, as the Gentleman did tho&s;e in his, and we fortunately got through, and we compa&s;s'd 3 Dutch miles in 4 hours: So we got to <HI>Galture:</HI> But we never heard more of our four Cingulayans that we lo&s;t in the fir&s;t Boat.</P>
<P>Our Lieutenant <HI>Sleght</HI> receiv'd us very nobly, and invited us to Dinner, and gave us other Cingulayans, which we &s;ent out before with our Boats. And be|ing <HI>Columbo</HI> was a great way from <HI>Galture,</HI> he or|der'd two Palanquins to be got ready for us (which are a &s;ort of Chairs, but &s;o contriv'd, that one may either &s;it or lye down in them) and two Culins
<PB N="302" REF="162">
or Slaves a-piece to carry us; they carry'd us very fa&s;t, and we got &s;afe to <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>
<P>The 5th, Mr. <HI>Bu&s;terweld,</HI> having &s;ent all his things aboard, and being to leave me behind, in|troduc'd me to a certain Captain of <HI>Columbo,</HI> one Min Heer <HI>Witzenburg,</HI> to whom after he had recom|mended me, he went on the 6th In&s;tant aboard his Ship to <HI>Punto de Gala,</HI> where he was to take in her Loading of Cinnamon and Pepper, and then put to Sea.</P>
<P>This Captain <HI>Witzenburg</HI> was a brave Soldier, a|bout 50 years of Age, was then in <HI>Columbo</HI> as Com|mander, and was likewi&s;e one of the Council, which con&s;i&s;ts of eight Men only, who are treated with no le&s;s Title than that of Honourable. They Judge and give Sentence in all Cau&s;es, as well Capital as others. Our chief Merchant, one <HI>Van Vor&s;ten,</HI> was the Pre&s;ident of them: He had been rais'd to this from a Cabbin-boy. The be&s;t part of them could neither Write nor Read: nor could the Captain I am &s;peaking of, tho' he was the third of the Coun|cil. If any Man will appeal from them, he mu&s;t transfer his Cau&s;e to <HI>Batavia,</HI> which is 500 miles di|&s;tant from thence.</P>
<P>I &s;taid 5 months with this Captain, during which time I was a very &s;erviceable Companion, by read|ing to him all Orders and Cau&s;es at home, before he went to the Council (for they were always &s;ent to them there fir&s;t) in which he us'd to take my opinion, and in an&s;wering for him all the Letters that came to him.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of July, I was obliged to go to a little Fort call'd <HI>Malvane,</HI> 4 leagues from <HI>Columbo,</HI> where I remain'd four months. The place is very &s;trong, by a River, it hath Palli&s;ado's, Parapets, and a Ditch, eight Field-pieces, and other nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;ixty Men to keep it. Our Head Officer there, was one <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> a Lieutenant. It was very unheal|thy
<PB N="303" REF="162">
by rea&s;on of the thick Fogs; and therefore the Garri&s;on is often reliev'd from <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>
<P>The 6th, We were inform'd that the King of <HI>Candi</HI> would Be&s;iege this Fort; wherefore we pro|vided our &s;elves again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The 16th, The <HI>Di&s;&s;ave,</HI> or General, appear'd with Thirty Thou&s;and Men, (this was that <HI>Tenne|cool</HI> the Renegado we have &s;poken of before,) and he let us know privately</P>
<P>On the 17th, That he re&s;ented an affront which the King of <HI>Candi</HI> had put upon him, and be&s;ides, that he had deceiv'd him in his expectations, for which he would now be reveng'd; and with this opportunity return to the Dutch, and not mole&s;t our Fort in any manner. We were oblig'd to keep this very &s;ecret, lea&s;t it &s;hould come to the know|ledge of his own Soldiers; and we &s;ent an account of his offers to <HI>Columbo,</HI> whence we receiv'd orders to direct him to <HI>Columbo,</HI> but not receive him into our Fort.</P>
<P>The 20th, He went with three hundred of his be&s;t Men to <HI>Columbo,</HI> where he was receiv'd ho|nourably by the Governor, and pre&s;ented with a Gold Chain worth 300 Ricxdollars. When the King of <HI>Candi</HI> had an account of this, he order'd the &s;iege to be rais'd, and all <HI>Tennecool</HI>'s Generation to be de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>The 31th of October we were reliev'd, and went altogether to <HI>Columbo.</HI> We were to cro&s;s over a River 7 or 8 at a time, with two Boats tyed to one another. I was one of the la&s;t that were to go o|ver. I was here very near being drown'd by an un|lucky accident. The old Dottia or Waterman was ju&s;t &s;hoving the Boats off of Land, when the Boats which are exceeding little turn'd over, for the Rope broke that tyed them together. My danger was &s;o much the greater, for that a lu&s;ty fellow, who fell in with us, and could not &s;wim, took fa&s;t hold of
<PB N="304" REF="163">
my Leg, and would have drown'd us both, had I not fortunately laid hands on the po&s;t to which the Boats u&s;ed to be tyed, by which means we were &s;afe. Tho&s;e that could &s;wim were in no great dan|ger: The others hung luckily upon the Boats that were floating with the bottom upwards; &s;o that all &s;aved their Lives. Some Mu&s;quets were lo&s;t, but it was a wonder that none of the Men were drown'd or at lea&s;t devour'd, con&s;idering that there is always &s;o va&s;t a number of Crocodiles in that Ri|ver.</P>
<P>From the 1&s;t to the 8th, We lay in the Old Town of <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>
<P>The 7th, and 8th, Several People were &s;ent out to hunt after the Prince of <HI>Candi,</HI> who had been kept &s;ome years by the Dutch, with a de&s;ign to put him on the Throne of <HI>Candi,</HI> when the old King &s;hould die. He was kept out of the City, near the old Ho&s;pital, and had a Guard of &s;ix Files of Mu|&s;queteers and one Serjeant; notwith&s;tanding which he found means to make his e&s;cape, and was never heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>He had been about &s;ix years at <HI>Columbo,</HI> where, at his coming, he declar'd him&s;elf to be of the Roy|al Blood of <HI>Candi,</HI> and the true Heir to that Crown, alledging that the pre&s;ent King of <HI>Candi</HI> had U|&s;urp'd it from him, and that he was the Per&s;on that &s;hould have &s;ucceeded the Old King. And indeed all the Inhabitants were much more affected to him, which they u&s;ed to expre&s;s continually by the rich Pre&s;ents they u&s;ed frequently to bring him.</P>
<P>The Dutch allow'd him Forty Rixdollars <HI>per</HI> month, and 41 Simmeri's of Rice, to maintain him|&s;elf and his Retinue, which was a Steward, a Wi|zard, a Captain, 20 Soldiers, 6 Drummers, 4 Lea|pers, and 8 Slaves, or Chair-men, to carry tho&s;e Sedans we have already &s;poke of; in all 21 Men. They would not have lo&s;t much by this, if he had
<PB N="305" REF="163">
continu'd at <HI>Columbo,</HI> and had ever come to the Crown of <HI>Candi;</HI> for they would have made &s;uch Articles with him before they had &s;etled him on the Throne, that he would have been little more than Titular King.</P>
<P>The 9th, Two Companies of Volunteers were form'd out of the Garri&s;ons of the City and Ca&s;tle, of 80 Men each, and were order'd to go to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel.</HI></P>
<P>The 10th, We were mu&s;ter'd up, and receiv'd the next day two months Pay. Our chief Officer was a Dantzicker, one <HI>Tobias Guntz,</HI> Captain-Lieu|tenant, and our two Lieutenants were one <HI>Koningh,</HI> and one <HI>Vernie.</HI></P>
<P>The 12th, We went aboard in two &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els, and arriv'd the next day at <HI>Calpintin,</HI> where our Men were lodg'd in a Church which &s;tands out of the Fortification, where Divine Service is done in Dutch, Portugue&s;e, and Malabari&s;h. This Fort was built here, and is carefully look'd after, becau&s;e it is a con&s;iderable Pa&s;s for other Nations; and be|&s;ides the Inhabitants drive no &s;mall Trade with the Moors, and others. A great Commodity there, is Areck, which is a Fruit that grows like the Nutmeg. Mo&s;t of the Ea&s;tern Indians cannot live without it, being &s;o us'd to it, that they are never well, but when they are chawing of it. The Soldiers here, which are 100 in number, keep Dogs, with which they go and Hunt Bufflers, Sheep, Stags. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon which they live: For the Land affords nothing but what's Wild, &s;ome Fi&s;h and &s;ome Rice.</P>
<P>We lay &s;till from the 14th, to the 18th, Then orders were given for every Man to make his own Provi&s;ion for three days, and to be ready on the 19th of <HI>March.</HI> Accordingly they were; and I having a de&s;ire to be in the adventure, provided for my &s;elf too, and order'd one of the Men to get me 6 pound of Beet boyl'd in Salt-water, and half a pound of
<PB N="306" REF="164">
Bisket. The next morning early we &s;et out. Our two Malabarian Guides went before us. At noon we came near to a Well, but found no Water there, which we began to want; but our want ra|ther increa&s;ed: Then we turn'd our &s;elves to a Ri|ver; where we thought to have &s;atisfy'd our &s;elves, and found the Water to be Salt. Our comfort was, that we were to come in the evening to a Well; but when we came to it, we found a Buffler fall'n in and drown'd, which made us all ab&s;tain from drinking, notwith&s;tanding we were exceeding thir|&s;ty. Our Guide then took us half a mile farther, to a deep &s;andy Soil, where they told us we might have Water. There we were forc'd to make &s;eve|ral holes in the Ground, 2 or 3 yards deep, to get at it; but we were happy &s;till to have it upon any terms. In this place we lay all night, having &s;et &s;ome Men to watch, and kindl'd &s;ome Fires to pre|vent the wild Bea&s;ts coming upon us.</P>
<P>The 20th, Early in the morning we march'd on thro' great Woods and De&s;ert-places, where we &s;aw and heard nothing but Elephants, Tygers, Bears, &amp;c. there being no Man in all that part of the Country. We came in the forenoon to an Arm of a Salt-River that reach'd into the Land a great way; &s;o that we were forc'd to wade over, after we had &s;taid about three hours, till the ebb was at the lowe&s;t; and then too we were all forc'd to &s;trip, and pack up all our Cloaths, Provi&s;ions, and Arms, and carry them on our Heads. We were almo&s;t half a quarter of an hour going over; and it was &s;o deep, that &s;ome of the lea&s;t of our Men, had much to do to keep the Water from running in at their mouths. Some that thought to be wi&s;er than our Guides, went up to a place where they &s;aw the Wa|ter run very rough, becau&s;e it was not &s;o deep there. It was but &s;hallow indeed, but the &s;tream was &s;o &s;trong there, that it threw 'em off out of
<PB N="307" REF="164">
their depth, and drown'd mo&s;t of 'em. We being got over made ha&s;te on, for we were by this time in want of Water again, and the be&s;t allay of our thir&s;t we could get, was our Bullets which we rowl'd about in our mouth to moi&s;ten them. At night we lay &s;till at a place, whence tho&s;e that would of nece&s;&s;ity drink were forc'd to go a|bout a mile for Water, and then dig for it too. After they had made each of them their hole, they drank their &s;ill, and then laid down in it for cool|ne&s;s, and took a nap there.</P>
<P>The 21th, Three Soldiers came to meet us with three Hor&s;es &s;ent from <HI>Manara</HI> for the Officers. We got upon them with a very good will, while the poor fellows were forc'd to drudge on without Shoes or Stockings (in the &s;ame manner as they &s;et out). We arriv'd all at <HI>Aripen</HI> about 3 of the clock in the afternoon, having gone about 22 Leagues in our three days march; which was very hard for our Men, who went all the way barefoot. <HI>Aripen</HI> is a pretty &s;trong place, kept by 20 Dutch Soldiers, provided with 4 Field-pieces, and other Warlike Nece&s;&s;aries convenient for a place of that big|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Many Malabarians live about it, of whom one may buy Fle&s;h, Milk, Butter, Eggs, Fowls, &amp;c. cheap enough: And we bought here two pretty good Bullocks for one Rixdollar, that &s;erv'd both our Companies.</P>
<P>This place is chiefly de&s;ign'd to keep the <HI>Pearl|bank</HI> from being &s;i&s;h'd by any one that hath no ti|tle to it, which is an o&s;&s;ence puni&s;hable with death. It is very unhealthy there, and no European but mu&s;t expect a Fever that will kill him, it he &s;tays there long. For which rea&s;on they are exchang'd from <HI>Manara</HI> ev'ry four months; and yet they lo&s;e generally half their Men. We &s;taid there all night, and</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="165">
On the 22th, We march'd away again, and at night came by the I&s;land <HI>Manara,</HI> to go to which we were to cro&s;s the Waters, which is about a mile broad: It is &s;ix miles from <HI>Aripen.</HI> We were very kindly receiv'd by the Dutch Captain that lay there; and treated very nobly with Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, which is here in great plenty.</P>
<P>This I&s;land, as we mention'd before, hath &s;even miles compa&s;s: It is inhabited by &s;everal Malabars, and abounds in Fle&s;h, Fowls, and fruitful Trees; and all the Water about it affords plenty of Fi&s;h. In &s;hort, it may be call'd an Earthly Paradi&s;e. The Fort is well provided, and is kept by near 100 Dutch Soldiers. Each Soldier keeps a Boy to clean his Arms and carry them for him, and a Woman to look after his Meat and &s;erve him. Proportio|nably to this, the Officers live in very great State. We lay here three days, and</P>
<P>The 16th, We went in three Dutch Boats to <HI>Jaf|napatan,</HI> where we arriv'd on</P>
<P>The 27th, And were very well receiv'd, and Quarter'd in the Fort that lies to the Sea.</P>
<P>The 28th, 29th, and 30th, Our Men were ex|ercis'd, and 20 Elephants were brought upon the place whil&s;t we Fir'd, to u&s;e them to &s;tand it with|out &s;tarting in War. At fir&s;t they were very fear|ful and untractable, not being able to bear the noi&s;e and &s;moak of our Guns, to&s;&s;ing up their Trunks, and were very furious. At la&s;t they were brought to it &s;o, that an Indian could get upon them, and ride about a Furlong away from us, and then drive them upon us, (we firing again&s;t them all the while,) at length they'd break our Ranks, take what care we could; and tho' we &s;hot in their very No&s;es; and if the Cingulayans that rid them had not prevented them with their In&s;truments, they would have trampl'd us under foot.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="165">
The 1&s;t of December, Two Companies of Sol|diers came to us from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> out of the Fort <HI>Palliacate,</HI> and <HI>Nagapatan.</HI> They were Quarter'd in a Stable, u&s;ed generally to keep Ele|phants in.</P>
<P>The 2d, Another Company came from <HI>Gala, Battacula,</HI> and <HI>Triconomala.</HI></P>
<P>The 3d, We had a general Mu&s;ter, and march'd with our 7 Companies, and 8 Field-pieces drawn by Elephants, and 20 others Elephants be&s;ides, out of the Fort of <HI>Jafnapatan.</HI> And being drawn out in the Fields there, we were commanded to inclo&s;e our Leaders; that is, to form our &s;elves into a Ring, where we heard the Articles of War read to us.</P>
<P><HI>Jafnapatan</HI> bears the Name of a &s;mall Kingdom, which the Dutch took by &s;urprize from the Portu|gue&s;es. Its Fort is well built, and &s;trong; having four Ba&s;tions, two Towers, a Counter&s;carp, and a deep Ditch. It lies upon a Salt-water on the &s;ide of <HI>Manara,</HI> where the Dutch have built a very &s;trong fine Key.</P>
<P>All the chief Officers lodge within the Fort with their Wives. The under Officers and Soldiers Wives live among&s;t the other Inhabitants in the Town, which is about a League in compa&s;s: But there are a great many Gardens in it, and many poor &s;mall Hutts; as al&s;o fair large Streets. There are two different Market-places in it; the one for Fi&s;h, the other is for all &s;orts of Commodities, as Silks, Linnen, Pearls, Gold, Silver, Spices, Salt, Butter, Allum, Tobacco, Rats and Mice, Herbs, all &s;orts of Colours; in &s;hort, all a Man can de&s;ire. Their current Money is made of Copper, and is either Shillings, Two-pences, Peny-pieces, <HI>Dama|ga&s;ties,</HI> Half-penies, and Farthings. One may buy 10 or 15 Figs for a Farthing, that are almo&s;t a &s;pan
<PB N="310" REF="166">
long; and &s;ometimes 2 or 3 Pounds of Fi&s;h for the &s;ame price: So that a Man that goes to Market with 4 or 5 Farthings, may buy Provi&s;ions to &s;erve a common Family two days for his Money.</P>
<P>I met here with an acquaintance of mine, a Phy|&s;ician, who was chief Chirurgeon to the Dutch Ho|&s;pital, and Phy&s;ician to Min Heer <HI>Laurent Piil,</HI> the Governor, and was much e&s;teem'd among the Na|tives of the Country for his Abilities, and the great Cures he perform'd.</P>
<P>The 4th, We march'd out. Our Major <HI>Clebout</HI> went fir&s;t, carry'd by Slaves in a Palankin, a &s;ort of Sedan, I have already mention'd. After him march'd the 6 Companies, with each an Elephant to draw the Baggage. It was &s;uppos'd that we were de&s;ign'd to march to <HI>Wani,</HI> where the Inhabitants had cho&s;en a new Prince without con&s;ent of the Dutch, their Prince <HI>Don Philip</HI> being Dead; and de&s;ign'd to free them&s;elves for the future from pay|ing Tribute to <HI>Jafnapatan.</HI> But as &s;oon as they un|der&s;tood that we were drawing towards 'em, they &s;ent to meet us with ten Elephants, with offers to continue willingly a yearly Tribute of Elephants and Money, on conditions we would &s;ecure them from the King of <HI>Candi.</HI></P>
<P>The Major &s;ent them to <HI>Jafnapatan</HI> with a Let|ter, and we came at night to a place call'd <HI>Pas-Piil,</HI> where a Dutch Garri&s;on lay. Here the Hutts were ready for our Men, and provided with nece&s;&s;aries again&s;t our coming.</P>
<P>The 5th, 6th, and 7th, We lay &s;till here, being much tir'd with going ten Leagues in a day in all that heat, and &s;o &s;andy a Country. We found there three great Dutch Ships that were come from <HI>Ba|tavia.</HI></P>
<P>The 8th, Four of our Companies, <HI>viz.</HI> The two that came from <HI>Columbo,</HI> the other two from <HI>Corman|del,</HI> were to Embark &s;ecretly, and the two other
<PB N="311" REF="166">
Companies were to remain in the Fort, by rea&s;on of the Troubles that were in <HI>Wani,</HI> That very eve|ning we &s;et forwards for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Corman|del.</HI></P>
<P>The 9th, Early in the morning, we came before <HI>Negapatan.</HI> Here a Dutch Yatch joyn'd us, and two other Ve&s;&s;els, together with three great Boats well Mann'd with Seamen. With this Fleet we &s;ail'd along the Coa&s;t by <HI>Krancko Baar,</HI> a City belonging to the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and lying 8 Leagues from <HI>Negapatan.</HI> We &s;ail'd by the Dani&s;h Admiral that lay in the Road, with two other Ships, to whom we &s;truck our Pendants. We pa&s;s'd on by <HI>Porto Novo,</HI> a Fort that belongs to the Moors, under the command of the King of <HI>Volkendal.</HI> They had a great many Boats before it, and one at a di&s;tance to watch the re&s;t. This one put up a Flag, and &s;ir'd a Piece for a Signal; and of a &s;udden they were all under Sail, taking us for Enemies. But it was but a fal&s;e alarm of theirs; for our de&s;ign was only up|on the Fort <HI>Policere</HI> (which is not far from St. <HI>Tho|mas)</HI> into which many Soldiers that had de&s;erted from the Viceroy <HI>Lakay,</HI> were got: And this Fort we had orders to Inve&s;t and Demoli&s;h, becau&s;e it was a great hindrance to the Dutch Commerce.</P>
<P>But on the 21th, A Yatch met us, that was co|ming to bring us word, that the French, upon no|tice of our coming, were fled out of the Fort, and gone to the King of <HI>Volkendal.</HI> So we went back to <HI>Nagapatan,</HI> where we arriv'd</P>
<P>The 11th, at night, and ca&s;t Anchor there. We heard that the Moors had drove away a Dutch Mer|chant that was Regi&s;terer, and Secretary of <HI>Mata|patan,</HI> and had &s;eiz'd all his Goods: Upon which we &s;ent 2 of our Boats with 150 men to redre&s;s this Injury.</P>
<P>And on the 13th, They came back with an ac|count of their good &s;ucce&s;s; and that they had re|&s;tor'd
<PB N="312" REF="167">
the Merchant his Habitation, and forc'd the Moors to give back all they had taken from him. Our Ship being to take up 400 quarters of Rice at this place, we lay &s;till there till</P>
<P>The 12th of January, 1679, When we &s;et &s;ail, and came on</P>
<P>The 13th, To a Dutch Fort call'd <HI>Punto de Pedre,</HI> a very plea&s;ant place, having great plenty of Oni|ons, Tamarins, Figgs, Cocos, Jager, and Areck|trees, which make delicate &s;hady Walks, &s;ome of 'em a mile or two long; and a fine Campaign Coun|try; There we lay all night, and very well lodg'd we were.</P>
<P>The 14th, Early in the morning, we march'd on foot to <HI>Jafnapatan.</HI> I was very dry in the march; and coming to a Malabarian Village, I &s;lipp'd into a little Hutt to get me &s;ome milk to drink. I found an old Woman there with her Daughter: I de&s;ir'd a Pint of milk, and they gave it me, asking me a <HI>Damagas</HI> for it (which is two-pence;) I drunk it off, and having paid my money, went away to overtake the re&s;t of my Company; and not think|ing of any thing, I was immediately &s;hot in the Leg with one Arrow, and with another in my Thigh. I pull'd them out, and look'd all about me, but could not perceive any body, nor whence they &s;hould come. However I thought to fright them, and cry'd out, <HI>O Nay, Dayoli, mettene Landes ingu|w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters">e;</HI> which &s;igni&s;ies, <HI>Ye dogs, there are more Dutch a coming.</HI> But that was all the revenge I could have, for I dur&s;t not complain of it, becau&s;e it was done by &s;tealth, and contrary to our orders, that I &s;topt there. So I went out of the Village as fa&s;t as I could, and &s;topp'd my Wounds with an old rag, that I u&s;ed to wrap the lock of my Fu&s;il in, and overtook my Company, and went on to <HI>Jafnapatan</HI> in great pain. There our Po&s;t was; and I immedi|ately went to my Countryman <HI>Lutz</HI> the Phy&s;ician,

who Cur'd me; but was forc'd to cut open my Wounds, becau&s;e the Arrows were poi&s;on'd. We &s;taid there till</P>
<P>The 14th of February, And then we were car|ried back in Boats to <HI>Manara.</HI> There was a Ve&s;&s;el here that would have held us all very well, but the Captain-Lieutenant would take but one Company in with him, wanting room for good quantity of Hogs and Onions, that he had a mind to carry to <HI>Columbo</HI> to trade with. We had very good Quar|ters here, and &s;taid till</P>
<P>The 1 &s;t of March, Then we were divided, and went in two Boats: The one was a large Dutch one, call'd the Elephant; the other a poor little Malla|bari&s;h one, into which it was my lot to go: It was quite open, and had neither Rudder, nor Compa&s;s. But tho&s;e in the Dutch Ve&s;&s;el told us that we &s;hould not want one, if we would but follow 'em; we told 'em we would if we could; but we gave our &s;elves over for lo&s;t, and never expected that it would carry us over the Sea. However we went well e|nough while the day la&s;ted; but towards the even|ing, coming to the <HI>Pearl Bank</HI> at <HI>Aripen,</HI> it began to Rain, and blow exceedingly. The Wind was good, but &s;o &s;trong, that we were afraid of over|turning ev'ry minute. Our four Seamen, who were Malabarians, thought good to keep as nigh to the &s;hore as we could; all of us thought very well of that too: But the Rogues, more afraid than we, as &s;oon as they came in &s;ight of the Land, leap'd into the Sea, and left us, and &s;wam to &s;hore. By mere good fortune we had &s;ome Soldiers among&s;t us, that had been Saylors, who manag'd the Sails and Stern. I had cho&s;en to lay me down by the Hearth, where they u&s;ed to dre&s;s their Victuals, to keep my &s;elf and my Writings dry; but the Rain beat upon me, and mixing the A&s;hes and Soot with it, I look'd next morning like a Chimney-Sweeper;

but the be&s;t on't was, that I kept my Papers very &s;afe.

There was an old fellow with us, that knew where-about <HI>Calpintin</HI> was, being well acquainted with the Country; by the help of his Directions, we thru&s;t off our Boat, and &s;ail'd by many other little I&s;lands like this, and got in &s;ight of <HI>Calpintin,</HI> and by the next morning to it.

<P>The manner of Fi&s;hing for Pearls: Why this &s;ort of Fi&s;hing was laid by for &s;even years. The Author's departure from <HI>Calpintin</HI> to <HI>Columbo.</HI> The Dan|gers he went through in his Journey. Comes to <HI>Co|lumbo.</HI> Pre&s;ents &s;ent by the Governor to the King of <HI>Candi:</HI> What they were. The Author is order'd to go along with them. In what ba&s;e manner the Can|dians receiv'd the Pre&s;ents; and then treacherou&s;ly fell upon tho&s;e that brought them. How they came off, and in their retreat de&s;troy'd two Heathen Tem|ples. What &s;trange things happen'd while they were about it. They return to <HI>Columbo.</HI> The Gates there are &s;hut up twice a day, and why. An account of <HI>Sittawack,</HI> and of the Amboine&s;es who &s;erve the Dutch Company there. Precious Stones in the Earth and in the Rivers; where most found. A De&s;cription of them; and where, and how they grow. What po|licy the Author was forc'd to u&s;e to get a Saphir of an Old Cingulayan. A &s;trange Cock. An Elephant falls into a Well, out of which there was no getting of him. An Earthquake.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEfore I proceed, I will inform the Reader how the Pearls are got here, how Fi&s;h'd for, and how Sold.</P>
<P>The Bank, where they are, lies in the Sea, not far from the Land. It is about twenty miles long, and two broad; from &s;even to ten Fathoms deep. It belongs at this time to the Hollanders. The Oy|&s;ters in which the Pearls are found, are about the breadth of one's hand. They &s;tick to the bot|toms of Rocks, &s;ome twenty or thirty together. There are People to look every year, and &s;ee whe|ther
<PB N="316" REF="169">
the Pearls are ripe; when they are &s;o, they write to all the neighbouring Kings to let them know what time the Fi&s;hing is to begin. Then the <HI>Divers</HI> are &s;ent, who are Malabarian Fi&s;hermen, who come with their Boats, and &s;ome Stones along with them. Each Diver hangs a Stone upon his Foot to &s;ink him the &s;ooner; when he is at the bot|tom, he fills his Net with Oy&s;ters, and then loo&s;ens him&s;elf from the Stone. Then the Stone, together with the Net, is drawn up by another Malabarian in the Boat, whil&s;t the Man &s;hoots him&s;elf up to fetch breath. When they have thus fill'd their Boat with Oy&s;ters, they row to Land, and throw them out. There is a Dutch Soldier waits on each Boat, to &s;ee that the Malabarians do not take any of the Pearls away. The three fir&s;t days the&s;e Boats are all em|ploy'd for the Ea&s;t-India Company; after this they may Fi&s;h for them&s;elves paying a Rixdoller a day for every Diver.</P>
<P>The Oy&s;ters are laid in heaps on the Shore, and the Merchants come there to buy them. They are &s;old at the rate of eight hundred for a Rixdollar. The gain or lo&s;s of the Buyer depends on meer chance: For &s;ome may be find no Pearls in all they buy; others make va&s;t advantage of their Bar|gain.</P>
<P>There hath been no Fi&s;hing here for the&s;e eight years. Some &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly think that the place is bewitched: Others give this for a rea&s;on (which I rather approve of) that the boi&s;terou&s;ne&s;s of the Sea hath cover'd the Oy&s;ters with Sand, &s;o that they cannot come at them.</P>
<P>The 6th, In the morning all our Company went in the Boat call'd the Elephant; and having the Wind for us, we expected to reach to <HI>Columbo</HI> by night. The number of the Soldiers and Officers was in all 110. We had but a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el with Water, a bu&s;hell of Rice, a &s;mall Buffler, and a

young Buck; which two la&s;t things were for a pre|&s;ent to the Governor. Thus the Boat was quite full, and no Man had room to lye down, but was forc'd to keep his Seat. The Wind blew North: But at noon it ceas'd, and then we went but flowly: but we kept in &s;ight of Land all along on our left hand. Toward night, the Wind aro&s;e again; and and then we made &s;ome &s;peed. Therefore the Steer&s;|men bad us all look out &s;harp for <HI>Columbo,</HI> where we earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd to be, e&s;pecially becau&s;e our Water Ve&s;&s;el was every drop drunk out.</P>
<P>The 7th, By break of day, we found that we were carry'd wide off of it by the &s;trength of the current, and partly by the over&s;ight of our Steer&s;|man: For we could &s;ee no <HI>Columbo,</HI> nor Land nei|ther. All the Officers were very angry with him for't, and would certainly have thrown him into Sea, if he had not got up to the top of the Ma&s;t, where they made him &s;tay all that day for his Pu|ni&s;hment. Our Captain con&s;ulted the Map of the I&s;land <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and he directed us &s;omewhat in our cour&s;e; and about night we got in &s;ight of <HI>Pico|d' Adam,</HI> or <HI>Adam's-Hill;</HI> and at &s;ix of the Clock next morning we got happily to <HI>Columbo.</HI> It was high time for us to get thither, con&s;idering that we had been two days and three nights without Meat or Drink. The Steer&s;man begg'd we would par|don him, and not complain of him to the Go|vernor.</P>
<P>The 8th, As &s;oon as the Gates were open'd, we enter'd the City and went to our re&s;pective Po&s;ts. The Captain, with whom I &s;pent &s;ome time when I was here before, &s;ent to me to de&s;ire me to make his Hou&s;e my own again, if I plea&s;ed. I did not make any refu&s;al of &s;o advantagious a proffer, but accepted of it, and I &s;taid with him till</P>
<P>The 16th, When I was order'd to go with &s;eve|ral others to carry a Pre&s;ent, which the Governor
<PB N="318" REF="170">
&s;ent to the King of <HI>Candi;</HI> during which time I had the Title and Office of Captain. The Pre&s;ents were, two Per&s;ian Hor&s;es, with &s;ine Velvet Cloaths and Trappings, each Hor&s;e led by two Malabarian Slaves: Ten Falcons, each carry'd by a Malabarian dre&s;s'd all in white: Six Musk-Cats, each in a diffe|rent Cage, carry'd by two Slaves: Six very large Cocks from <HI>Tutucurini,</HI> each of them likewi&s;e in a Cage, cover'd with green Velvet: Two Per&s;ian Sheep, each with a Tail that weigh'd 20 or 25 pound: A Box that had two Bottles in it, that held each of them &s;ix Gallons of Per&s;ian Wine: Be&s;ides this, a great piece of <HI>Sandel</HI> Wood, that weigh'd 200 pound, wrapp'd up in &s;ine white Linnen. The Letter that was to be deliver'd to the King, was carry'd in a Silver Cap by a Serjeant bare-headed, and a Canopy was carry'd over it by four Cingu|layan Nobles: By each of which another went with a large Wax-Candle lighted as long as a half Pike.</P>
<P>Our march began in order at the Governor's Hou&s;e. Some Companies of Cingulai&s;h Soldiers went fir&s;t; then &s;ome Companies of Dutch; then the Pre&s;ents; after them two Companies more of Dutch. The&s;e were order'd to go as far as the King of <HI>Candi</HI>'s re&s;idential Town, <HI>Ruenel.</HI> All the City was in Arms, and all the Cannon was Fir'd round, and a Dutch Company that conducted us out of Town gave three Vollies and went back again.</P>
<P>We, together with the others before-mention'd, went on with the Pre&s;ents. At night we came to a place, where Dutch Potters live, two Leagues from <HI>Columbo;</HI> there we lay that night, and the next morning march'd on, and came</P>
<P>The 17th, At night to <HI>Hanquelle</HI> or <HI>Gourwebel,</HI> a Dutch Fort, where we lay.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="170">
The 18th, We had a very unplea&s;ant and dirty way, and were not a little tormented with Blood|&s;uckers, till we came to the Fort <HI>Sittawack,</HI> which is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dutch, and 12 Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Columbo.</HI> Immediately Letters were written, on leaves of Sugar-trees, and di&s;patch'd to the <HI>Co|ral</HI> of <HI>Candi</HI> at <HI>Ruenel,</HI> to acquaint him with our being come thither, with a Pre&s;ent for the King his Ma&s;ter; and that he &s;hould permit them to come forwards, if he pleas'd to receive them. But not a word of an&s;wer did we get, and we &s;taid here in expectation of it &s;ix whole Weeks, till the end of September. At la&s;t we had Directions &s;ent us from <HI>Columbo,</HI> which were, That we &s;hould go four Leagues farther beyond <HI>Ruenel,</HI> and deliver them to the <HI>Coral,</HI> and then come back. And accordingly</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of October, We went; and after ha|ving cro&s;&s;ed &s;even little Rivers, we came to <HI>Ruenel.</HI> This Fort heretofore belong'd to the Dutch, but was abandon'd by them, tho' them&s;elves had built it. There we cro&s;s'd over, and having march'd a League further, we came to a large Plain, where we halted a while to re&s;t and refre&s;h our &s;elves. By that time we had been there about half an hour, we &s;aw and heard &s;everal &s;mall Parties of Cingule&s;es coming upon us from ev'ry &s;ide. Our chief Com|mander &s;ent &s;ome Cingulayans to ask what they meant to do? They an&s;wer'd them, that the King of <HI>Candi</HI> had &s;ent them to take the Pre&s;ents we had brought.</P>
<P>We would not tru&s;t 'em. So we put our &s;elves in order, and &s;tood our Ground. Their number &s;till encrea&s;ed, and they came very thick out of a Wood. At la&s;t their Artillery (which was very &s;mall) appear'd too, and then they drew towards us. We &s;ent again to 'em to know what they de|&s;ign'd to do with their Artillery, and whether this
<PB N="320" REF="171">
was their cu&s;tom to repay Civilities? They told us their Field-pieces were not loaded.</P>
<P>We would have been glad to have been at home again, for we were but two Companies of Dutch of 160 Men each, and two or three hundred Cingulay|ans; and the&s;e Heathens were almo&s;t innumerable. They appeared as thick as Gra&s;s on the Field. The Pre&s;ents were &s;ent for by the <HI>Monthou,</HI> who was one of the King's Chief Officers, and an under Officer took them and delivered them to him. He recei|ved them, and he giving no orders for their Artille|ry to be di&s;chrged, we gave no Volley of our &s;ide.</P>
<P>Our Officer de&s;ired to &s;peak to the King's <HI>Saudi</HI> in Per&s;on, and a place was appointed for them to meet at, equally di&s;tant from them both. The <HI>Saudi</HI> came upon an Elephant, and our Officer was on <HI>Hor&s;e-back.</HI> The&s;e two &s;orts of Creatures are not to be brought near one another, wherefore they were forced to light, and meet a-foot.</P>
<P>The <HI>Saudi</HI> did not take off his Cap, becau&s;e he be|long'd to Crown'd a Head: Ours only repre&s;ented a body of Merchants, and Deputy Governors.</P>
<P>Our Officer complained of the manner of our Re|ception, and ask'd why &s;o many thou&s;and Men were drawn out again&s;t us, knowing that we had but two Companies of Dutch: The rea&s;on the <HI>Saudi</HI> gave was, That his Ma&s;ter had commanded it to be &s;o; &s;o they parted, but neither would draw his Men off fir&s;t. At la&s;t, Night coming upon us, we were forced to retire.</P>
<P>They let us pa&s;s by quietly enough till we were got to the River by <HI>Ruenel</HI> (which is mo&s;t like the <HI>Rhine</HI> of any I ever &s;aw;) But as &s;oon as one of our Companies was got over, they fell upon the Rear of the other. Our Cingulayans took the River, and &s;wam over, leaving us in the lurch. We continu|ed Firing upon them, and they upon us; till we were all got quite over. We lo&s;t our Lieutenant and
<PB N="321" REF="171">
two private Soldiers. We killed &s;everal of theirs, and wounded many more. We had a very bad way to go, and it fell a Raining, which made it more Dirty and Slippery, &s;o that we could not go &s;o fa&s;t as we would have done. We retired towards <HI>Sittawack,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;teep Rock; whence it is reported, That the late King of <HI>Sittawack</HI>'s Wife and Daughter flung them&s;elves down headlong, having received the News that he had lo&s;t the Bat|tle again&s;t the King of <HI>Candi.</HI> The Candians all the while came after us, but were not able to do us any great harm, becau&s;e the ways were &s;o narrow that they could not come up to us. Yet we were forced every now and then to Fire in the Rear of us.</P>
<P>The 2d, 3d and 4th we re&s;ted at <HI>Sittawack,</HI> the next day we de&s;troyed two Heatheni&s;h Temples not far from that place; they were built upon a ri&s;ing Ground, and cut out of a va&s;t Rock: Within they were adorned with many Images and Statues of Wood and Stone, repre&s;enting Devils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Under one of the Pagods we found a dark black hole, as it were grown &s;o with Smoak, no body dur&s;t venture to creep in. We threw &s;ome Straw into it, and Fired it, but we could not &s;ound the Depth or Length of it. Some Fellows were mightily afraid of &s;tanding near the hole, and were afraid that we &s;hould poke &s;ome Cingulayan Devil out of it; but if he was there, he did not come out, nor did we find out what it was made for.</P>
<P>We had &s;everal Lutherans and Papi&s;ts among&s;t us; the fir&s;t of the&s;e fell a Singing &s;ome Spiritual Hymns in the Temple, that had that hole under it. The Papi&s;ts went together into the other, and they having among them an Old Fellow that had been a a Prie&s;t heretofore, he fell to &s;aying Ma&s;s. There was on the &s;udden &s;uch a noi&s;e, and thundring, and cracking, that we thought we &s;hould have been a
<PB N="322" REF="172">
blown up, or that the Temple would have fallen up|on us, Some run out thinking to be &s;afer, but the noi&s;e and hurly-burly was greater there than with|in, &s;o that &s;ome came in again; and this continued a quarter of an Hour.</P>
<P>The 6th we came away, and toward the Even|ing entred into <HI>Columbo;</HI> where we found two great Ships lying in the Road come from <HI>Japan,</HI> with Cop|per, Gold, China and <HI>Saccapali</HI> which is a liquor of a faint &s;mell, but very whol&s;ome.</P>
<P>The 7th I was ordered to my Po&s;t, which was at the Gate call'd <HI>Victoria,</HI> where I &s;tay'd till the 2d of February 1680. I had 110 Men under me. The Ca&s;tle Gates were open'd and &s;hut, every Morning and Night at Six of the Clock, and all the Keys ty'd together with a Silver Chain, were car|ried to the Governor: The Gates are &s;hut likewi&s;e from Eleven to One a Clock in the Day time, that being the hotte&s;t part of the Day, and therefore generally taken to &s;leep in. We Exerci&s;ed our Men every Mondy, and every Sunday we went con|&s;tantly twice a Day to Church, where Divine Ser|vice was performed in Dutch and Portugue&s;e, after the Reformed way.</P>
<P>The 9th In&s;tant we went to relieve the Com|pany that was at <HI>Sittawack,</HI> Twelve Leagues from <HI>Columbo;</HI> we got there that Night, and the next Day being</P>
<P>The 10th, the Company march'd out and left us. And here I &s;hall give the Reader &s;ome &s;hort Account of the Fort of <HI>Sittawack:</HI> It is &s;cituated upon a Rocky Ground; near to this, ju&s;t over the River, &s;tood heretofore the King of <HI>Sittawack</HI>'s Pa|lace, ruin'd &s;ince by the Portugue&s;e: It is about four hundred Paces in Circuit: It is built four|&s;quare, with four Ba&s;tions, call'd, <HI>Rycloff, Loui&s;a, Columbo,</HI> and <HI>Gala;</HI> Each of the&s;e Ba&s;tions hath two Pieces of large Cannon. In the middle of this
<PB N="323" REF="172">
place is a large &s;quare Bulwark: Under this are kept the Provi&s;ions, as Rice, Fle&s;h, Salt, and Bran|dy; and the Ammunitious of War, Powder, Gra|nadoes, and Balls: Over that was the Guard Room, where all the Men lay; at each corner of which were two &s;mall Pieces of Cannon. Half the Men might have leave to be out of the Fort in the Day|time, but at Night they were to be in, every Man, upon pain of Death. Every Night the Names were call'd over, and Prayers Read; and on Sunday Night we had a Sermon preach'd in the Guard-Chamber. Here is al&s;o a Company of Amboine&s;es continually kept in the Dutch Service. Their Licu|tenant was call'd <HI>Alons,</HI> and was of Royal Blood. They live in the Town altogether, and with their Huts they make a very pretty Street, and they have their Wives with them. But at Night they are as much obliged to be in the Fort as any of us. They are very nimble and active at Running or Leaping. They never have but little Beards, and behind in their Necks they have a &s;ort of bunch grows like a Wen. Their Pay is, for a Lieutenant 24 Rix Dollars a Month, an En&s;ign 16, a Corporal 8, a Private Centinel 5, all paid in Mony.</P>
<P>The Cingulayans are mightily afraid of the Am|boine&s;es, and rather more than the Europeans are; for they are great devourers of Men. They wear Muskets and &s;hort Swords. Be&s;ides their own Lan|guage, they generally &s;peak Maley&s;h, Cingulai&s;h, Portugue&s;e, and Dutch. They love Gaming exce&s;|&s;ively, and the day time they generally &s;pend in Cock-fighting, Cards, and Dice; and when they have lo&s;t all their Mony, they go to &s;ome work or other, as Carving &s;everal things in Stone or Wood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till their Month's Pay comes into their hands again, and as &s;oon as they have paid their Debts, what is left they put to the venture; and when they have lo&s;t that, it is much if the Wife is not &s;trip'd of all
<PB N="324" REF="173">
her Ornaments to &s;upply him in the pur&s;uit of his Gaming, and the Family is left often in an extream nece&s;&s;ity, and ready to &s;tarve.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Sittawack,</HI> it is a Fort de&s;ign'd to re&s;i&s;t the King of <HI>Candi:</HI> It hath three little Counties or <HI>Corls</HI> depending upon it, the one is call'd <HI>Cuculi</HI> and in Dutch the <HI>Hoender Grafschap, (Hoender</HI> &s;ig|nifying <HI>Fowls,</HI> which are there in abundance;) the &s;econd is call'd <HI>Bulatkam-Corl,</HI> from the quantity of Plants it produces, which &s;erve for Food to the Inhabitants: The third <HI>Bi&s;ang-Corl,</HI> from the great quantity of Figs that grow there. In each of the&s;e <HI>Corls</HI> are &s;ome hundreds of Pea&s;ants that are under Contribution, and are forced to pay a fourth part of all their Rice to the Fort, and likewi&s;e of their Fruit-bearing Trees, as <HI>Cocos, A ack, Sugar.</HI></P>
<P>This Fort be&s;ides &s;erves for a Guard upon all the pretious Stones, as Rubies, Saphyrs, Emeralds, the Topaz and Azure Stones, that lie in and upon the Ground: They are &s;ometimes wa&s;ht into the Rivers by the great Rain and Water Floods. In the River that runs from <HI>Saffrigam</HI> (which was once a Dutch Fortification, but now left) one may find abundance of little Rubies, and &s;ometimes a pretty large one; the very Sand of that River is al|mo&s;t of the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance with the Stones, being of a Red and Blue Colour. We often u&s;ed to go to bath in that River, and &s;eek for precious Stones, but not when the Water was high, for fear of the Crocodiles; though it was not worth any Man's while, unle&s;s he could &s;wim, and venture to dive in the deepe&s;t places for 'em; becau&s;e it is there only that tho&s;e of any con&s;iderable bigne&s;s are to be found.</P>
<P>There is a little rivulet that runs below this Fort, coming from between two high Hills, and di&s;charges or empties it &s;elf into the River, in which are found Saphyrs, Emeralds, Topaz and Lazule-Stones:
<PB N="325" REF="173">
We have walk'd many a day in this Water for two or three Miles an end, to look for 'em. We had little Basket-nets which the <HI>Amboine&s;es</HI> lent us; and we us'd to thru&s;t the Nets into holes, and fetch'd out good and bad together, and &s;hake out of the Net all the Sand and Gravel, and the Stones that were of any bigne&s;s remain'd. Tho&s;e that had no Net made but but little on't. The Elephants us'd to be very trouble&s;ome to us, and we were forc'd often to go &s;ome Miles about to avoid them, and I for my part was always provided with a Gun again&s;t them; and for fear too of Tygers and Ser|pents.</P>
<P>A &s;mall account of the Nature of the&s;e Stones will not be unplea&s;ant to the Reader; wherefore I will, as far as I know, give as brief an account of them as I can:</P>
<P>And fir&s;t for the Rubies, they grow in a reddi&s;h, &s;tony, &s;andy Ground, one Fathom or two deep, &s;preading them&s;elves like Veins, and though the great Floods carry them away in the Rivers; they keep their Beauty and Colour as well under water as under ground, but if the water runs off of them, and leaves them ever &s;o little expo&s;ed to the Sun, they turn as black as a Coal.</P>
<P>The Saphirs grow in a hard blui&s;h ground, about a Fathom deep, and in veins too, and are wa&s;ht likewi&s;e into the Rivers by the violent Rains and Flood. Some are as big as the top of one's Finger;</P>
<P>So are Emeralds, Topazes, and Lazule-&s;tones, the&s;e are as Red as Fire, and as Blue as the Skie.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of &s;tone is found here, call'd Cat's Eyes: The&s;e are &s;o call'd from their colour, which is a changable Blue and White.</P>
<P>Red, Blue, Yellow, Black, and White Chry|&s;tal is to be found every where, and is very trouble|&s;ome to Men upon their March, when they go bare-foot,
<PB N="326" REF="174">
as all our Men did, but they find an Herb ve|ry common there, which they call Hor&s;e-foot, that cures them in two or three days time.</P>
<P>Some of our Company us'd to frequent tho&s;e Ri|vers every day, and at la&s;t all of 'em contract|ed &s;ome Di&s;temper, and that was all that &s;ome got by it; wherefore our Officers gave orders that no man &s;hould go any more into the water upon that de&s;ign.</P>
<P>On a certain time that I was upon no Duty, I went about a League from the Fort, where I &s;py'd an old Cingulayan, with his two Sons, in the River &s;eeking Stones: I took care to come up to them without being di&s;covered, lea&s;t they &s;hould have &s;lipt away; I ask'd 'em if they had found any &s;tones, one of 'em an&s;wer'd, <HI>Netti Ralu,</HI> which is, no Sir; I would not believe him, &s;o I &s;earch'd his Cloaths, and found in &s;ome of his Buttons, among other little Saphyrs, one that was about the bigne&s;s of a Hazel Nut. I askt him if he would &s;ell it, he re|fus'd it at fir&s;t, but at la&s;t he offer'd it me, and two &s;mall ones with it, for half a Dollar, Dutch Mony. I had at that pre&s;ent time no Mony by me, and I dur&s;t not take it by force from the old Fellow nei|ther, becau&s;e he was a &s;ubject of the Dutch; and what to do I could not tell, having a great mind to the &s;tone too: I had a piece of Chry&s;tal in my Pocket, which I took out, and convey'd the Saphir into my mouth; &s;o I told him I would give him his price if he would go to <HI>Sittawack,</HI> and offering to give him it again, to keep till then, I let the Piece of Chry&s;tal fall into the Water, he thinking it was his &s;tone, cry'd out, <HI>O Deine Balatie,</HI> which &s;igni|fies, Plague it is gone: I &s;eem'd concern'd, and told him he might find it again. He and his Sons went to &s;eck for it, but to no purpo&s;e: They were mighty &s;orry for their lo&s;s; I told them I would make them &s;ome recompence, and took them with
<PB N="327" REF="174">
me to <HI>Sittawack,</HI> where I gave them three &s;hillings, and they went away very well &s;atisfied. I made u&s;e of this &s;tratagem, becau&s;e if I had left the &s;tone in their keeping, they would have mi&s;tru&s;ted me, and never have come to the Fort after me.</P>
<P>The Tenth of March I went with two other Lu|theran Gentlemen, (each of us having a Gun with us,) to the Hill, where we had not long &s;ince de|&s;troyed the two Pagods, to &s;ee what condition they were in. We found them ruin'd as we had left them, and poked again in the dark hole; But I believe we had routed the Devil the time before, for we could not make him roar any more, do what we could. At the bottom of the Hill I &s;aw abundance of fine Cocks and Hens, and I bought &s;ome of the Hens and one Cock of an old Woman they belong'd to. She told me that the Cock I bought was con&s;a|crated for an Offering, while the Pagods &s;tood, and therefore that I &s;hould not kill him, and that he would beat any Cock what&s;oever. I laugh'd at the &s;tory, and yet was a little afraid becau&s;e it was de|&s;ign'd for the Devil, and did not know but he might come and fetch him. However I ventur'd upon him, and paid as I did for my Hens, a Dutch peny for each of them. Being come to the Fort, I let him run there: In two or three days he fought and beat every Cock in the Fort that he could come nigh. Every Body wondred at the &s;iercene&s;s of this little Cock, and I began to think that what the old Woman had told me might be true. At la&s;t I made a trade of Cock-&s;ighting, and I got all the Amboine&s;es about me. They laid wagers among them&s;elves, and I only won the Cocks that mine beat, which amounted to two or three and thirty. At la&s;t they ignorantly hit the Nail on the head, &s;aying that the Devil was in him. Being to go to <HI>Columbo</HI> again, I took him with me, and thought he would have done as great feats there, but he was
<PB N="328" REF="175">
overmatched with a Cock that came from <HI>Tutucurini,</HI> that beat him lu&s;tily.</P>
<P>The 2d of March, A <HI>La&s;erin</HI> came to Town, and told us that an Elephant was fall'n into the King's Well, on the other &s;ide of the River. I went with &s;everal others, and &s;aw him lye at the bottom &s;quee|zed together, &s;tanding almo&s;t up an end, but his Legs bent, and he was very unea&s;ie. We took &s;ome Fig leaves which we threw down to him; he took 'em very thankfully, and eat them. At la&s;t he lif|ted up his Probo&s;es, and made a horrid noi&s;e, which we interpreted as a begging us to help him out; but he lying 12 Fathoms deep, we could not po&s;&s;i|bly do it. One of our Drummers was there with us; who having been pur&s;ued one time by an Ele|phant, as he was Hunting, knew this to be the Ele|phant, that had put him &s;o hard to his &s;hifts; for if it had not been for a large Tree that he climb'd up into, he had certainly been kill'd. The Drummer to be reveng'd of him, went the next day by him&s;elf, threw a great many dry &s;ticks upon him, and &s;ome &s;traw, and &s;et it all on Fire, and then came home and told us the exploit.</P>
<P>The 3d of the &s;ame Month about 8 or 9 of the Clock at night, We felt a very violent Earthquake coming from the Northward, which &s;hook our Block-hou&s;e extreamly. All the Men that lay in the Guard Room were awaked out of their &s;leep, and thought it was an Alarm. Ev'ry body would make ha&s;te to come out, and ev'ry body would be fir&s;t down &s;tairs. The Throng was intolerable; and in the bu&s;tle the Lamp went out, which made the grea|ter Confu&s;ion; &s;o that at la&s;t very few went out as they &s;hould do, but fell down &s;tairs. We felt three &s;everal &s;hakes, the la&s;t of which was &s;o very violent, that we thought the whole I&s;land would have been lo&s;t; and we heard from the Seamen that lay in the Road before <HI>Columbo,</HI> that they had felt
<PB N="329" REF="175">
it very &s;en&s;ibly too. What conclu&s;ions may be drawn from this, of the cau&s;es of Earthquakes, I leave Naturali&s;ts to agree about if they plea&s;e or can.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Spent all the Month of March in Hunting, and I liv'd altogether upon what Game I u&s;ed to bring home with me. Upon a certain night the Moon being at Full (knowing it would be light all night) I, with three Gentlemen more, went out into a fair Plain, about a league from <HI>Sittawack,</HI> where we de&s;ign'd to have &s;ome Stags. We &s;et our &s;elves down at the &s;ide of a Hill, to watch the wild Bea&s;ts, that we expected would come out of a Wood to feed where we were, there being very fine Gra&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="176">
The fir&s;t that appear'd were Bufflars, among which there was a Stag; they came directly to the place where one of our Company was (who was a Swede) and did not know what Creature it was. As &s;oon as the&s;e came to &s;mell him, they took to the top of the Hill again immediately, and made a great noi&s;e there. On the other &s;ide we heard &s;everal E|lephants making towards us. About Mid-night, being tir'd with &s;itting, we got together to ask one another's Advice, what we &s;hould do, when the Elephants came. We re&s;olv'd to fall upon them; becau&s;e we concluded they kept the Game from co|ming into the Dale, and &s;o &s;poil'd our &s;port.</P>
<P>When we got into the middle of the Plain, an Elephant broke out of the Wood, and run at us immediately; We took to our Heels, and run as fa&s;t as we could to the place where we fir&s;t &s;at down; there we took Courage again, and re&s;olv'd to go on again, and that not one of us would run away, as we had done before: At the left hand of the Plain, we &s;aw two great Elephants by a Tree eating the Leaves of it.</P>
<P>The Swede would &s;hew the greate&s;t Courage, and went foremo&s;t; and being within 60 paces of 'em, fir'd upon them, but they did not &s;tir for all that: After that I went a little nearer, and &s;hot one of of them in the Head, which made him make a mo&s;t hideous noi&s;e; and then they ran off into the Wood again.</P>
<P>We heard on the other &s;ide of us &s;ome more of 'em, and went towards 'em: We heard where they were, but we could not &s;ee 'em; for they were feeding about a Tree that had boughs which reach'd down to the ground, among&s;t which they &s;tood like &s;o many Hor&s;es at a Manger. We came clo&s;e to the very Tree, where they were, and yet could only hear 'em. I went a little on one &s;ide of the Tree, and then di&s;cover'd a terrible huge Elephant,
<PB N="331" REF="176">
with four &s;mall ones be&s;ides, about ten paces from me. My Gun was cock'd, and I, having overcome that little Pannick fear that &s;eiz'd me at fir&s;t, gave fire upon the bigge&s;t, and hit him ju&s;t on the head, which made him roar lu&s;tily. Then I retir'd, and another &s;tept in, who fir'd likewi&s;e, and then ano|ther; &s;o we kept firing three times a piece round. The Elephants gave ground, but not above 20 or 30 paces, and &s;et up a hideous roaring.</P>
<P>We did not think it &s;afe to pur&s;ue any more Game; So we went back to <HI>Sittawack.</HI> The next morning the neighbouring Cingulayans came down to the Valley, to &s;ee what was done there, having heard much &s;hooting in the night; They found an Elephant, with two very &s;ine teeth, lye dead. They gave an account of it to our chief Officer, who &s;ent immediately for me, and ask'd if we had &s;hot the Elephant: I told him it was probable, becau&s;e we had been pur&s;ued in the night by &s;ome of 'em, which oblig'd us to fire upon 'em. This was the only rea&s;on that could &s;erve to excu&s;e us; for it is &s;trictly forbidden to &s;hoot any Elephants, unle&s;s a Man is in danger of his Life. Our Officer &s;ent word of it to the Governor of <HI>Columbo,</HI> and &s;ent withal the Elephant's two Teeth. The Fle&s;h of this kind of Animals is good for nothing; the Fat is u&s;ed for Lamps, the re&s;t was left in the place.</P>
<P>In April it rain'd &s;o violently, that we were al|mo&s;t overwhelm'd with Water. The Amboine&s;es, who, as I told you before, liv'd in the Town, were forc'd to be taken into the Fort, with their Wives and Children; Men, and Bea&s;ts, both tame and wild, were drove up into the Mountains: And our Fort was very full of Serpents, Scorpions, and o|ther venomous Creatures. We did what we could to keep them out, by making Fires at all the Gates and Po&s;ts where the Sentinels &s;tood.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="177">
The Rains abated in May, and likewi&s;e the Floods; and that Month I &s;aw nothing remarkable, but that the Elephants &s;hew'd them&s;elves in va&s;t Numbers about our Fort. Mo&s;t nights of this Month I went a Hunting with Cingulayan Sports-men, and with them I had always good Sport; and brought &s;ome|times as much home as would &s;erve the whole Gar|ri&s;on. An Indian u&s;ed to go foremo&s;t, with a lighted Torch upon his Head, and a Stick in his Hand, to which &s;ome Shells are tyed loo&s;e; and he goes along &s;haking of 'em, making a continual rat'ling. As &s;oon as any Bufflers, Harts, or Hares, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hear this, and &s;ee the Fire, they come towards it, and within &s;hot of the fellow; then he that goes behind him &s;hoots as many as he plea&s;es of 'em. But the fellows &s;ometimes are in danger of being run at by an Elephant, who now and then pur&s;ues them, and puts 'em to it very hard, not|with&s;tanding their Fire, and the ratt'ling of their Shells.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of July, There came an Envoy from <HI>Co|lumbo</HI> to <HI>Sittawack,</HI> call'd <HI>Mierop:</HI> He had with him an Amba&s;&s;ador from the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> He rode in a very fine curious Chariot, made after the Per&s;ian manner, drawn by two Oxen, cover'd with fine white Linnen. His Pre&s;ents for the King of <HI>Candi</HI> were two white Lions, three Tygers, twelve Musk-Cats, all carry'd in very neat Cages, lin'd with green Velvet. Two black Per&s;ian Hor&s;es, co|ver'd likewi&s;e with green Velvet; and twenty Fal|cons, carry'd by &s;o many black Malabarian Slaves. The Letter was carry'd by the Dutch Amba&s;&s;ador in a Silver Cup, and over him was a Canopy carry'd by 4 Cingulayan Noblemen bare-headed.</P>
<P>The 2d, We guarded the&s;e Pre&s;ents as far as a place, call'd The <HI>Devil's Tree,</HI> by <HI>Ruenel;</HI> and ha|ving given our Amba&s;&s;adors three Vollies, we left them. They went forwards with their Pre&s;ents
<PB N="333" REF="177">
to <HI>Buare-Birge,</HI> which is in the King of <HI>Candi</HI>'s Do|minion. As &s;oon as the King heard of their co|ming thither, he gave orders to have them all &s;e|cured, and provided Nece&s;&s;aries for the Men, and the Bea&s;ts they brought along with them; and to keep them in clo&s;e cu&s;tody till further orders. And it is a que&s;tion whether or no they will ever be &s;et at liberty: For it is above 22 years &s;ince one <HI>John Bapti&s;ta</HI> was &s;ent thither as an Envoy from the Dutch, and another Amba&s;&s;ador &s;ent from the French Vice|roy of <HI>Trinconomala,</HI> who are there &s;till, kept in Pri&s;on and in Fetters, without any hopes of being ever free, as long as this King lives.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this Con&s;inement, they live very hard; for tho' the King allows them nece&s;&s;aries (and tho&s;e it may be not in great plenty neither) the King's Officers convert the half of them to their own U&s;e and Profit.</P>
<P>On this &s;ame day, Two gray Old Men came to us in the Fort of <HI>Sittawack,</HI> dre&s;s'd after the Cingu|layan manner. They told us that they came about 20 years &s;ince to <HI>Calpintin</HI> with an Engli&s;h Ship, and that they, with ten other Seamen, being &s;ent on &s;hore to this I&s;land to fetch Provi&s;ions, Water, and Wood, they were trapann'd by &s;ome Candians, who &s;ent them to <HI>Candi,</HI> where they had been kept Pri&s;oners all that while every one of 'em. That the other ten were dead, and they two had ventur'd their Lives to make their e&s;cape, and had left their Black Wives behind them. They had been eight days a coming (or rather eight nights, that being the only time they could travel in, being forc'd to lye hid all day in the Woods). They had heard that day the &s;hooting from our Fort, and judged it, by that, to be a place in the Hands of the Chri|&s;tians; and were over-joy'd to find them&s;elves deli|ver'd out of the power of their cruel Ma&s;ter, the King of <HI>Candi.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="178">
One of them was a Gunner, the other a Drum|mer, and both &s;poke be&s;ides, Engli&s;h, very good Cingulaian and Portugue&s;e: The Gunner told us a great many pa&s;&s;ages of his Life, during their Sla|very; and among&s;t other Relations, de&s;cribed to us the Richne&s;s of the King of <HI>Candi</HI>'s Warlike in|&s;truments: His Carriages are all over-laid with Gold and Silver, and inlaid with Rubies and Saphyrs. He told us that he had &s;een once a great Ruby that a Cingulaian Pea&s;ant had found, and carried home to u&s;e for a Whet-&s;tone, and had whetted his Knives and Hatchets with it for &s;ome Years. A certain Field Officer of the King of <HI>Candi</HI> happening to go to that Contryman's Hou&s;e, &s;aw it, and carried it to the King, who &s;ent immediatly for the Country Fellow, and askt him what he would have for his Whet&s;tone: The poor fellow told the King that he had found it in the River of <HI>Bibliogam,</HI> and that it was at his &s;ervice, and that he could get another &s;tone to do his bu&s;ine&s;s as well. This innocent an|&s;wer &s;atisfied the King that he did not know the value of his Jewel; for had he known it, it would have co&s;t him his life. The King di&s;mi&s;t him, and commanded &s;ome Land and Cattle to be given him, ordering him for the time to come to let &s;uch &s;tones lie whenever he found 'em.</P>
<P>The 3d In&s;tant the&s;e two poor Engli&s;h Men were &s;ent in a Boat to <HI>Columbo;</HI> I went along with them to introduce them to the Governor, who received us with extraordinary courte&s;ie, and after a great many que&s;tions to &s;atisfie his curio&s;ity, &s;ent for Cloaths, which he freely pre&s;ented them with, and then took them to his Table, and very civilly de&s;i|red them to &s;tay in his Hou&s;e till &s;ome opportunity offer'd it &s;elf to &s;end them to <HI>Batavia,</HI> where they might ea&s;ily get an Engli&s;h Ship to carry them to <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="178">
The 4th I went back with two Soldiers to <HI>Sit|tawack,</HI> where I continued till</P>
<P>The 12th; when we were all relieved by a fre&s;h Company from <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>
<P>The 15th we march'd from <HI>Sittawack</HI> in the Morning, and came at Night to <HI>Columbo.</HI> I pack'd up among&s;t my things, two or three hundred of <HI>Bulat</HI> Leaves, which two Cingulayans carried after me. The&s;e Leaves I have already told you are chew'd commonly by the Inhabitants; &s;o I brought them to make a pre&s;ent of to my Landlady. I can't tell whether Heaven de&s;ign'd me an occa&s;ion of making my Fortune or no, but however it was, I refus'd laying hold on it; and how it was I will re|late in &s;hort. My Landlady treated me very civilly from the fir&s;t time of my coming to her Hou&s;e, where I paid her 3 Rixdollers by the Month, and had a very good Table, and what Suri I pleas'd at Meals: Her entertainment grew in time kinder and kinder; and then it broke out into &s;ome prelimi|nary interrogations, why I would not &s;ettle there? Why I would not Marry? and many things of that kind; at la&s;t it came to a clo&s;e application, and to a plain offer of her &s;elf, if I would marry. When I con&s;idered her on one &s;ide, as to her Fortune, I mu&s;t confe&s;s &s;he did not altogether di&s;plea&s;e me. Her fir&s;t Husband was a &s;ub&s;tantial free Merchant at <HI>Columbo,</HI> call'd <HI>John Chri&s;tantz;</HI> he was owner of of a Ship, with which he had often been at <HI>Bengal</HI> at the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> and drove there a con&s;iderable Trade, but going there again in the year 1678, was ca&s;t away with a <HI>Hurrican,</HI> and he and his &s;hip lo&s;t. What &s;he lo&s;t by this accident I do not know, but &s;he was left worth near thirty thou&s;and Ducats, and twenty Slaves from <HI>Bengal</HI> which &s;he u&s;ed very inhumanly: But the Figure &s;he made never would permit me to entertain a thought of marrying her, but that other People may judge
<PB N="336" REF="179">
whether I was too nice, or but rea&s;onably &s;o, I will give &s;ome de&s;cription of her: I did not di&s;like her merely for her being Black, but methoughts her Ears, though they were richly &s;et out with Gold, look'd but hideou&s;ly, being longer than my Hand: Her Hair, that would reach down to her Heels, &s;he would be&s;mear every Day with Oyl made of Coco-Nuts, and then wind it up on her Head, ju&s;t as we &s;erve Hor&s;es in <HI>Holland,</HI> when they have long Tails: She wore a little &s;hort &s;ort of a Wa&s;tcoat that hardly covered her Brea&s;ts, fa&s;tned with Gold Buttons; from the Brea&s;t down to be|neath the Navel &s;he was Naked. The be&s;t part of her Dre&s;s was from beneath the Navel downwards, having a Linnen Garment down to the Feet, and another-like one at top of that, &s;omething longer than the under one: She had a great Necklace round her Neck made of Gold and Ivory: She &s;poke no Dutch, but Portugue&s;e and Cingulai&s;h, which were her Father and Mother's Languages, and the Mala|barian which is much the &s;ame. All the&s;e things together were &s;o far from rai&s;ing any Pa&s;&s;ion for her, that they were a pre&s;ervative again&s;t it, &s;o I e'en left her as I found her.</P>
<P>There were at this time two Sloops and a Yacht ready to &s;et &s;ail for the Coa&s;t of Malabar, there to hinder the Malabarians Boats in their Pepper Traf|&s;ick: I was &s;ent to command them, and had my choice of Men out of all the Company: After that I pick'd them out that I liked be&s;t, I took twenty of them with my &s;elf on board the Yatch, call'd the <HI>Trinconomala,</HI> and in each of the two Sloops went 12 Men, and 7 Seamen.</P>
<P>The 18th. in the Evening we &s;et &s;ail. I had with me be&s;ides my twenty Men, a Steer&s;man, and 15 Seamen; and I put off with our Flags and Pendants as Commadore from <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="179">
The 19th, 20th, 21&s;t, and 22d, we &s;aw no Land: We had the wind for us, but the &s;tream was contrary to us.</P>
<P>The 23d, we e&s;pied land in the Forenoon, and in the Afternoon we came before the Town <HI>Couchin,</HI> which belong'd heretofore to the Portugue&s;e. I went to the Commadore that lay there, and deli|ver'd my Letter to him from the Governor of <HI>Co|lumbo.</HI> The next Day he joyn'd us with another Sloop well Mann'd, and gave us in&s;tructions how we might be&s;t annoy the Malabarians.</P>
<P>The 25th we went to Sea again, and there Crui&s;ed along the Coa&s;t up to <HI>Goa,</HI> a Portugue&s;e Town. We were in a continual Cha&s;e, and all the Boats that we met loaden with Cardamunga, and Pepper, and could not produce a Dutch Pa&s;s, we took. Their Provi&s;ions and Goods we &s;tow'd in our Ve&s;|&s;els, and &s;unk theirs; but many of the Malabarian Ve&s;&s;els being little ones, kept in the Shallows near the Land, where we could not come, ours drawing much more Water than theirs did, and tho&s;e were &s;ecure enough.</P>
<P>The 6th of October, we went back to <HI>Couchin,</HI> and brought thither fifty Malabarian Pri&s;oners with us, and a great deal of Onions, Pepper, Car|damunga, Rice, and Dry Fi&s;h. I acquainted the Commadore with what I had done, and brought with me, and he left all the Booty among&s;t us, ex|cept the Pepper, which he kept to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Here we &s;tay'd till the 20th of November, and found it much better living than in <HI>Ceylon.</HI></P>
<P>The 21&s;t, we went back homewards, and arrived happily at <HI>Columbo</HI> on the 29th about three of the Clock in the Afternoon: I deliver'd to the Gover|nor my Letters from <HI>Couchin,</HI> and every one went to his re&s;pective Po&s;t. We had but two Men dy'd in the Expedition, they were &s;hot with two Poy|&s;on'd

<HI>A&s;&s;agayen</HI> or Darts; and one Seaman had his Arm &s;hot off by a Gun that bur&s;t in the firing.</P>
<P>The 30th, a Ma&s;ter Gunner call'd <HI>Henry Scholten</HI> was &s;hot to death, he was a Lutheran, and would not hearken to any in&s;tructions or advice that our Prote&s;tant Mini&s;ter offer'd him: But being come to the place of Execution, he pray'd for him|&s;elf: Three Muskets were fired upon him, which di&s;patch'd him in an in&s;tant. Then his Friends took him and put him in a Coffin, and buried him. The &s;ame day two Moors of <HI>Volkendal</HI> that had been catch'd at <HI>Aripen</HI> by the Pearl-bank, were &s;oundly whipt, all their cry was <HI>Apoi Paring, Apoi Paring</HI> in Malabarian, that is to &s;ay, Mercy Sirs, Mercy Sirs; at la&s;t they hung their Heads on one &s;ide, which made me think they were dead; but as &s;oon as the whipping was over, they held up their Heads briskly again. The Executioner rubb'd their wounds afterwards with Pepper and Salt, and they were kept in Fetters, as belonging properly to the Company.</P>
<P>I was now offer'd a Po&s;t, which I thought more advantagious, and not expos'd to &s;o much Fatigue, which was to be Over&s;eer of the 12 Clerks belong|to the Ea&s;t India Company: I accepted of it, and entred into the Office on the 1&s;t of December. The Chief of that Office was one <HI>Walter Vander Beek.</HI> It was open from Seven till Ten in the Morning, and from Two till Six in the Afternoon, all which time there was bu&s;ine&s;s enough for the Twelve Clerks.</P>
<P>I Dieted all this while with my long-ear'd Wi|dow, who continu'd asking me why I would not marry: I told her I would have her if &s;he would leave off Oyling her Hair, and let her Ears be clipt into &s;hape; at which &s;he &s;hook her Head, and &s;aid in a doleful manner that &s;he would die fir&s;t.</P>

There was at this time a Jew that had liv'd a con&s;iderable time in the Hou&s;e of a Cingulai&s;h No|bleman, and had been very familiar with his Daugh|ter, tho' not Marry'd to her: He had a grievous fit of Sickne&s;s, during which &s;he was &s;o faithful and &s;erviceable to him, that he promis'd her Marriage as &s;oon as he &s;hould be recover'd. Being got up again, &s;he pur&s;ued him to make good his Promi&s;e; but the Jew refus'd it out of meer &s;hame of being &s;een at Church with &s;uch a long-ear'd Creature; and told her that was the only rea&s;on he could give her for going back from his Word. She, to remedy that, con&s;ented to have her Ears cut into better fa&s;hion, and had it done accordingly; after which the Jew Marry'd her in <HI>Columbo</HI> on a Sunday. A little while after he fell Lame, both in his Hands and Feet, and nothing but misfortunes befell him. The cau&s;e of all this he imputed wholly to his be|ing turn'd Chri&s;tian; and look'd upon all as a ju&s;t Judgment upon him for having for&s;aken the Jewi&s;h Religion: Bitterly Cur&s;ing the hour he had ever been Baptized. Another Jew, a Convert likewi&s;e, Marry'd at the &s;ame time a Black young Gentlewo|man of <HI>Malabar,</HI> very Rich; but this Marriage proved more happy than the other.</P>

<P>The Parties being agreed before-hand, the Bride|groom comes, with two or three of his Friends, to the Bride's Hou&s;e, where &s;he is dre&s;s'd in fine white Linnen and fine Flowers, to receive him.

Church; and the Tue&s;day after that, they are Mar|ry'd. When they go to Church, they have &s;everal Balliators, or Leapers, that go before them Dan|cing all the way. Then goes the Bride between two Women, with a fine Umbrella over her Head; then the Bridegroom between two of his Friends. The Ceremony being ended; when the Bride is come home again, every one in the Room Sprinkles her with Ro&s;e-water, and throws an handful of Flowers upon her. Then they have a Wedding-Dinner, which is always given by the Maid's Fa|ther and Mother at their Hou&s;e: When the new Couple are got to Bed, they fall a-beating Drums, Tamelins, and other In&s;truments, for about an hour; the Balliators all the while Dancing, and making a great noi&s;e. The next day they go about a mile or two out of Town, where they have a Dinner at &s;ome Publick-Hou&s;e, which is generally given by the two Bride-men.</P>
<P>Any European in <HI>Ceylon</HI> may marry any Woman he plea&s;es: But if he is in the Dutch Service, the Marriage is not permitted; unle&s;s a Te&s;timonial is given of the Woman's being Chri&s;ten'd, under the Mini&s;ter's Hand and Seal.</P>
<P>The&s;e Women pretend to have a much greater Inclination and Love for a white Man, than for their own Country-men: So that, if there is any Credit to be given to 'em, one might be pretty &s;ecure of keeping one's Wife to him&s;elf, at lea&s;t, from a black Rival. But I have known many In&s;tances to the contrary, of Women that have been brought to Bed with black Children, which never happens if a Woman keeps con&s;tantly to an European; and &s;everal complaints I have known made of this kind to the Mini&s;ters.

The Woman pretended to like the bargain well enough, but told him &s;he could not for the pre&s;ent do it with &s;afety, but the next opportunity &s;he would grant him his de&s;ire. The fellow went home very well &s;atisfy'd with the hopes of his future Enjoy|ment. But when the Shoe-maker came home, his Wife very faithfully tells him all that had pa&s;&s;ed between them: The Man was not a little glad to find his Wife &s;o virtuous, and de&s;ir'd her to admit him in|to the Room, where he de&s;ign'd to lay wait for him. At the time appointed the Malabarian came, and the Woman, according to promi&s;e, gave the &s;ignal; upon which the Shoemaker and a Neigh|bour of his came out, each of 'em having a good Club, and fell upon the poor Malabarian, and di&s;|abl'd him from any &s;uch attempts for the future.

the Europeans, who have all the power in their hands, than out of any true love for 'em.</P>
<P>The Women live very lazy Lives; they chaw Betel and &s;moak Tobacco, all day long; they are very neat, and wa&s;h them&s;elves all over every day. The Man hath all the Care of the Hou&s;e upon him; and they have generally two Slaves, the one to go to Market, the other to dre&s;s the Victuals.</P>
<P>I will, now I am treating of <HI>Columbo,</HI> give you &s;ome De&s;cription of that City.</P>
<P>I have already told you how it was built by the Portugue&s;e; but when the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Com|pany took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, they Demoli&s;h'd many parts, and Re-built others after the Dutch man|ner; and to this day they are building at the Ca|&s;tle and City. The Ca&s;tle hath on the We&s;t-&s;ide, the Sea; on the North-Ea&s;t, the City; on the South-Ea&s;t, a &s;weet River: It is fortify'd with &s;everal Bulwarks, each of which hath 20 or 30 Guns; a very good Counter&s;carp; and there are &s;o many Rocks on the Sea-&s;ide, that no Ships can come near it.</P>
<P>There is a broad Channel runs all round it, where one may &s;ee every day Crocodiles in abundance: It hath three Gates, one to the South-We&s;t, call'd <HI>Port de Gala;</HI> about a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot off, on the &s;ide that goes to <HI>Galture,</HI> the Land about it is richly fill'd with Orchards and Gardens, full of fine Fruit-trees, which reach a mile or two: The other Gate is call'd the <HI>Delfsche Port,</HI> from the Ba&s;tion which is ju&s;t by it, that bears that Name. This Gate is toward the City, and the way to it hath the Sea all along on one &s;ide, and a deep Ditch on the o|ther, and a large Field call'd the <HI>Buffler's Plain,</HI> which they can lay all under Water when they plea&s;e, by opening a Sluce. The third Gate, which is Northward, hath the Name of <HI>Water-Port;</HI> on the left &s;ide of that is the <HI>Water-Pa&s;s,</HI> guarded by
<PB N="343" REF="182">
many Cannon, that command all the Ships that lye in the Road. Within the Ca&s;tle are many pretty Walks of Nut-trees, &s;et in an uniform Order, but they bear no Fruit, only red and white Flowers: The Streets are plea&s;ant walks them&s;elves; having Trees on both &s;ides, and before the Hou&s;es. The Ca&s;tle contains about 40 Acres of Land. The Go|vernor, all the Merchants, Officers, and Soldiers, have their Dwelling within it; and without the Walls, between them and the Sea, are the Huts, where near four thou&s;and Slaves, belonging to the Company, lye at night. They are of different Na|tions, and are con&s;tantly kept at work: Their Huts are very little, made up with nothing but Straw and Leaves. There are Dutch-men to look over 'em, who are call'd <HI>Mucadons;</HI> each of the&s;e have 70, 80, 90, or 100 to over&s;ee, and mu&s;t give an account of 'em.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a very large place for Ammu|nition, two &s;trong Cellars for Gun-powder, and Magazines for the Merchants, and a Church; and behind that, a very fine Stable, commonly full of Per&s;ian Hor&s;es. There is al&s;o a Powder Wind-mill by <HI>Port de Gala,</HI> and by the <HI>Water-Pa&s;s,</HI> a Wind-mill to &s;aw Boards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The City of <HI>Columbo</HI> is much larger than the Ca&s;tle, by rea&s;on of the large Trees and Gardens that are in it; and it is very well fortify'd with five Bulwarks, call'd, <HI>Victoria, Con|&s;tantia, Concordia, Haerlem,</HI> and <HI>Euckhuy&s;en.</HI> It hath on the North the Road where the Ships lye; on the other &s;ide the River that is full of Crocodiles. It hath three Gates, the one (as I &s;aid ju&s;t now) is call'd the <HI>Delfsche-Port,</HI> the &s;econd is not far from that, and goes toward the Sea; the third is the <HI>Port-Victoria,</HI> or <HI>Negumbo.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants are a mixture of Officers, Soldiers, Burghers, and Trade&s;men, Blacks and Whites, and others: For which rea&s;on the Hol|landers
<PB N="344" REF="183">
are oblig'd to keep a careful watch every night. The Streets are always very clean, tho' it Rain never &s;o much. There is an Ho&s;pital for the Dutch, very well provided with able Surgeons, and they with very good Medicines, and Slaves allow'd them. The chief Doctor, that had the Care of it in my time, was in very ill Repute for his ill Ma|nagement of tho&s;e that came under his Hands, and for &s;everal ill Actions he was accus'd of; and, a|mong&s;t others, of having a pretty while been too familiar with a Slave of his, and then Killing of her, and Burying her in his Garden.</P>
<P>Not far from that is an Ho&s;pital for Dutch Or|phans: The Boys are taught to Read and Write; after that they are made either Drummers or Sol|diers: The Girls, be&s;ides Reading and Writing, are taught to Sew, or any other Employment pro|per to their Sex; and there they are kept to work till &s;ome-body comes to marry 'em, which com|monly happens by that time they are 12 or 13 years of Age.</P>
<P>The Dutch Church-yard is in the middle of the City, enclos'd with a Wall, on which a Malabarian School &s;tands: On the out-&s;ide of the Church-yard, there is Sold, all the Week long, Silks, Stuffs, and Linnen, by the Moors and Per&s;ians; and all &s;orts of Fruits, dry'd Fi&s;h, Onions, Sugar and Rice, by the Malabarians, Maldivians, and Cingulayans, and other Inhabitants of <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>A &s;ad Accident happens before <HI>Columbo</HI> by Gun-pow|der. Two Ships come to <HI>Columbo</HI> from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> bound from thence for <HI>Holland.</HI> The Author is di&s;|charg'd at his request (tho' with &s;ome difficulty): Is to go to <HI>Punt de Gala</HI> by Sea, to Embark there. The Ma&s;ter being drunk, they run the Ve&s;&s;el against a Rock, and all &s;unk. The Author and fourteen others &s;ave their Lives by &s;wimming to &s;hore; but lost all their Goods.

At last, by God's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they came &s;afe home.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the Year 1680, We had three unlucky Ac|cidents: The one was, That a Ship being come from <HI>Holland</HI> by <HI>Batavia,</HI> and lying at Anchor in the Road near <HI>Columbo;</HI> it had brought a great quantity of Gun-Powder for the u&s;e of this City; the Inhabitants thereof had already loaded their Boats with 80 Barrels of it, and were &s;o near Land, that they prepar'd for haling of it to &s;hore: A Boy, belonging to the Ma&s;ter of the Boat, &s;tood &s;moaking with a Pipe in his Mouth; which the Ma|&s;ter &s;eeing, gave him &s;uch a box on the Ear, that he da&s;h'd his Pipe into the next Boat, where &s;ome Powder being &s;catter'd, took Fire, and blew up that Boat, and, in the twinkling of an Eye, the
<PB N="346" REF="184">
two next; and not only &s;o, but al&s;o, all the People that &s;tood upon the &s;hore had a to&s;s in the Air.</P>
<P>Another was, That two Ships lying at Anchor in the Road, and the Wind growing very violent, broke their Cables, and &s;tranded them again&s;t the Fi&s;h-market; but all the Men &s;aved their Lives.</P>
<P>The 9th of December, Two great Ships call'd the <HI>Africa,</HI> and the <HI>Cortegeene,</HI> came from <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Having now &s;taid &s;even months over and above the five years I was oblig'd to, in the Service of the Ea&s;t-India Company, I de&s;ign'd to have gone off with tho&s;e Ships, but the Governor refus'd to di&s;charge me for that time, under pretence of af|fection to me.</P>
<P>They &s;ail'd away on the 10th from <HI>Columbo</HI> to the City <HI>Punt de Gala,</HI> to take in Pepper and Cinna|mon. I made my complaint that I was detain'd wholly again&s;t my will, to the chief Merchant of the Company; he told me I &s;hould go, and that I &s;hould &s;tay but &s;ome days; that a Ve&s;&s;el was daily expected to come from <HI>Bengal,</HI> and was to take up &s;everal other Per&s;ons here, and then to go for our Country.</P>
<P>The 11th, News came from <HI>Punt de Gala,</HI> by Land, that the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el was come in there from <HI>Bengal,</HI> well loaded with Salt-peter, but had no Ma&s;ts left.</P>
<P>On the 12th, Some Carpenters and three Ma&s;ts were &s;ent in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el to refit the Ship, and get it ready to go with the two others for <HI>Hol|land.</HI></P>
<P>The 14th, I went to the <HI>Aldee</HI> or Village, call'd <HI>Batalamulo,</HI> two miles from <HI>Columbo,</HI> where I took my leave of our General <HI>Di&s;&s;ave Tennekool</HI> (that was come over to us from the King of <HI>Candi.)</HI> He entertain'd me very civilly at Dinner, and order'd four Cingulayans to carry me back in a <HI>Palankin,</HI>
<PB N="347" REF="184">
to <HI>Columbo,</HI> and pre&s;ented me with 200 pre&s;erv'd Citrons for my Voyage.</P>
<P>The 15th, My Captain invited me at night to a very hand&s;om Supper.</P>
<P>On the 16th, A very rich Portugue&s;e, call'd <HI>Don de Pairo,</HI> living at <HI>Matual,</HI> a league from <HI>Columbo,</HI> &s;ent an Elephant for me to come to his Hou&s;e, where he receiv'd me with a noble Entertainment of Mu|&s;ick, and a &s;plendid Fea&s;t: I &s;pent that night with him; during which he u&s;ed a great deal of Rhe|toric to per&s;wade me to &s;tay, and ask'd me, why I would venture &s;o hazardous a Voyage, &s;eeing I liv'd &s;o plea&s;antly there, and &s;o much belov'd in that Country; but all this was in vain: My Incli|nations for my own Country were to me the mo&s;t prevailing Arguments.</P>
<P>On the 17th, I took my leave of him, and thank'd him very heartily; and he lent me an Elephant to carry me back.</P>
<P>On the 18th, I took my leave of my Friends at the Office at <HI>Columbo,</HI> and</P>
<P>On the 19th, My Landlady invited me, with &s;ome others of her Friends and Acquaintance: She &s;eem'd very much di&s;contented with my leaving of her thus, yet would &s;hew her &s;elf kind to the la&s;t; and pre&s;ented me with abundance of Fruit and Spi|ces: But when I came to Sea, I threw all over|board, for fear &s;ome trick or philter &s;hould have been play'd with them, which is u&s;ual here.</P>
<P>The 20th, The Governor &s;ent us word, that we &s;hould get us all ready to go aboard that night; about four of the Clock in the afternoon, we went on board, and took all our Goods with us. Our Ship was but &s;mall, yet it had four Pieces of Can|non, twelve Seamen, be&s;ides the Ma&s;ter, and the Steer&s;man. Our Maker was one <HI>Cornelius Era&s;mus,</HI> a <HI>Jutlander,</HI> a true <HI>Pitcherman,</HI> who &s;taid at <HI>Co|lumbo</HI> to take his leave of his Wife, and Friends;
<PB N="348" REF="185">
his Wife was a Papi&s;t when I knew her fir&s;t, but he was a Lutheran. While I was at <HI>Columbo,</HI> I took a great deal of pains to convert her, and at la&s;t ef|fected it; but I believe &s;he only embrac'd <HI>Luther</HI>'s faith becau&s;e it was her Husband's: I thought however &s;he had chang'd &s;omewhat for the better; and I believe if I had &s;taid, I might &s;till have advis'd her better. She had a Si&s;ter, one of the prettie&s;t Wo|men I almo&s;t ever &s;aw; at lea&s;t, the fine&s;t that e|ver was in that Country. She was a white Wo|man, and her Mother was a Babylonian. The dre&s;s &s;he went in was a great di&s;advantage to her Beau|ty, being the &s;ame dre&s;s as I de&s;crib'd before, when I &s;poke of the Habit my long-ear'd Widow u&s;ed to wear.</P>
<P>Being oblig'd to lye &s;till here till the 21th to &s;tay for Letters, I went in a Fi&s;her-boat to <HI>Columbo</HI> to our Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, where he was making very mer|ry, having &s;taid a while, he took his leave of his Wife and Si&s;ter, who were very much griev'd at his de|parture; but they little thought it was their la&s;t farewel, as it prov'd the next day; for, being got into the Ship, and having weigh'd Anchor, we &s;ett &s;ail. The Wind toward night grew &s;omething boy&s;terous; and as we came within a mile of <HI>Punt de Gala,</HI> our Ship, by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter, and Steer&s;man, who were carrou&s;ing in the Cab|bin, &s;truck upon a great Rock, call'd the <HI>Whale</HI> (which is but ju&s;t cover'd over with Water) and &s;prung a large Leak, which made the Ship be|gin immediately to &s;ink. The Ma&s;ter hearing the knock, and being &s;en&s;ible of the Danger, came out to give orders, and cry'd out we &s;hould turn the Ship about; but it was too late to give Directions; &s;o we prepar'd our &s;elves for &s;wimming; and I &s;tripp'd my &s;elf to my Drawers, and with &s;everal others I leap'd into the Sea; we gue&s;s'd by the &s;cum where-abouts the &s;hore was; we made that
<PB N="349" REF="185">
way, and in le&s;s than half an hour we reach'd the Land: We were fifteen of us that &s;av'd our &s;elves by &s;wimming; the re&s;t, being the Ma&s;ter, the Steer&s;man, and ten others, were all drown'd.</P>
<P>We went to the fir&s;t Hou&s;e we &s;aw, which be|long'd to a Cingulai&s;h Nobleman, who receiv'd us very kindly, had a great Fire made for us, and gave us all the refre&s;hment his Hou&s;e did af|ford.</P>
<P>The 23th, In the morning we came before the Town of <HI>Punt de Gala.</HI> The Serjeants, Corporals, and Soldiers that kept the Guard, were mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion; and, before we went any further, gave every one of us &s;ome old Garments to cover our Nakedne&s;s; After this we were brought before the Governor, who examin'd us all, to know who was to blame for this mi&s;carriage. The Ma&s;ter was in all the fault we told him, but he had his Puni&s;hment already. The Governor order'd every one of us to have 12 Rixdollars paid us to equip our &s;elves again, which was to be abated in our Accompts. Six of the Men that came from <HI>Colum|bo</HI> with me would not venture to Sea again; &s;o they engag'd them&s;elves a-new for three years, in the &s;ervice of the Company; their Pay was augmented with two Guldens a month, and they were now to have twelve Guldens, whereas they u&s;ed to have but ten. Orders were given to a Serjeant to take twelve men with him to go that very morning and &s;ee if they could recover any thing of our Ship|wrack. I went thither my &s;elf in the afternoon, and &s;aw a great many pieces of the Ship, and pie|ces of Che&s;ts a-&s;hore: But I &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected that they were broke by the Soldiers, and that they had bury'd the Goods under Ground.</P>
<P>The 14th, Some of the Men that were drown'd were drove upon the Land; the re&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, had fea&s;ted the Sharks, that are there in abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="186">
The 25th, I went on board the <HI>We&s;ter-Am&s;tel,</HI> and gave my Pa&s;s to the Ma&s;ter of it. The form of it was thus: <HI>To</HI> N. N. <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Ship, call'd the</HI> We&s;ter-Am&s;tel; <HI>You may receive on board the Bea|rer hereof,</HI> Chri&s;topher Schewitzer, <HI>with his Goods, to go with you into</HI> Holland.</P>
<P>My Ship did not at all plea&s;e me, for I &s;aw it was very Old, and be&s;ides that, very &s;mall, and mighty &s;low in &s;ailing. The Carpenters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were bu&s;ie in mending of it: In the mean while I went to &s;hore again, and &s;taid at <HI>Punto de Gala,</HI> till the Ships were all ready, and there I took my provi|&s;ions. This Fort, by what I &s;aw of it, is &s;tronger than that of <HI>Columbo.</HI></P>
<P>The 5th of January, 1682, All our loading was compleat; it con&s;i&s;ted of Pepper, Cinnamon, Lin|nen, and Silk-&s;tuffs, from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Bengal.</HI></P>
<P>On the 13th, An Officer came to take a view of all the Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>The 14th, We hoi&s;ted up Sail all together, with a direct Wind for us at S. E. The <HI>Cortgeene</HI> being the bigge&s;t Ship, was our <HI>Commadore,</HI> or Admiral. We fir'd all our Cannon: The like was done in re|turn all round <HI>Punto de Gala.</HI></P>
<P>The 15th, We kept a Fa&s;t in our Ship, to beg God's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our Voyage; all the Dutch Ci|ties in <HI>Ceylon</HI> did the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The 16th, The Ma&s;ters of our Ships met in the <HI>Cortgeene</HI> to advi&s;e and re&s;olve upon their &s;ignal, in ca&s;e of their needing one another's a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and upon the Watch-word, and ordering of their Lan|thorns in the night-time.</P>
<P>The two large Ships &s;ail'd away briskly, but ours went very &s;lowly; towards night they took in &s;ome of their Sails, that we might come up to them.</P>
<P>We had in our Ship, the Ma&s;ter, three Surgeons (one of which always read Prayers) &s;ome Officers,
<PB N="351" REF="186">
12 Soldiers, 24 Seamen, all together made 56 men. The two other Ships had each of 'em 150. We had be&s;ides a great many Animals on Board, <HI>viz.</HI> Two Parrots, two Apes, two <HI>Cacadus</HI> of <HI>Amboina,</HI> (they are white Birds as big as Pigeons, with a tu&s;t on their Heads, and apter to learn to talk than the Parrots;) we had a Crocodile an Ell long, a Stag from <HI>Bengal:</HI> All the&s;e dyed in two months time, except the two Apes. We had likewi&s;e fifty Hogs from <HI>Bengal,</HI> and two or three dozen of Ducks for refre&s;hment now and then. Our otherProvi&s;ions were 60 Barrels of Water, 6 Barrels of Salt Pork, 6 of other Fle&s;h, 6 Barrels of Indian Brandy, and Rice enough. Our Ship was loaded at bottom with old broken pieces of Cannon in&s;tead of Balla&s;t, then with Salt-Peter, then with 200 La&s;ts of Cinnamon and Pepper; and at top of all there were 250 great Bales of Silks and Linnen.</P>
<P>We kept altogether without &s;torms, or bad wea|ther till the 28th of April.</P>
<P>We were then near the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa;</HI> but a thick Fog came upon us, and the Wind changing at South We&s;t, blew us in one day and two nights 50 miles from Land; after which it changed to the Ea&s;t by which means we came,</P>
<P>On the 30th, in &s;ight of <HI>Ta&s;el-bergh, Lewen-bergh,</HI> and <HI>Duyvels-bergh.</HI></P>
<P>The 1&s;t of May, We came to the <HI>Cape of good Hope:</HI> There we found the Ships that were come from <HI>Batavia,</HI> that had lain there &s;even Weeks &s;tay|ing for us: There were five of them, four large Ve&s;&s;els, and one Fi&s;her-boat, call'd the <HI>Po&s;tborn.</HI> On board the Admiral, call'd the <HI>Land&s;chowen,</HI> that had a very fine gilt Stern, was the Old Heer <HI>Rycloff van Goens,</HI> heretofore the General over the Ea&s;t-India Forces. They told us that they had &s;uf|fer'd much in the Latitude of St. <HI>Morrice</HI> by a
<PB N="352" REF="187">
&s;torm, which had wholly di&s;abled the <HI>Middleburgh,</HI> but that &s;he was &s;ince almo&s;t re&s;itted.</P>
<P>We lay there &s;till &s;even days longer, and in that time took in fre&s;h Water, Wood, Turnips, Herbs, Cabbage, Sheep, and Goats. Min Heer <HI>Rycloff van Goens,</HI> with all his Retinue, lodg'd all that while at the Governor's in the Fort. His Retinue was very magnificent; having &s;everal Gentlemen to wait on him, a Trumpeter, 12 Men for his Guard, all dre&s;s'd very fine in yellow, with &s;ilver Buttons, and red Breeches, and a great many Slaves from <HI>Bengal.</HI> I lay at a Dutch Countryman's Hou&s;e un|der the Devil's Hill; he was forc'd to keep &s;eve|ral Hottentots, and great Dogs, to &s;ecure his Vin|yards and other Grounds from the Wild Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The 2d, A Ship came and lay among&s;t ours in the Road; &s;he put out white Flags and Pendants. The Men on board of her gave out that they were French Merchants. But at night a Seaman comes &s;wimming to our Admiral by the Moon-&s;hine, and di&s;covers what they were. He told 'em that they were French Pyrates, richly loaded with the booty they had got along the Arabian Coa&s;ts: For his own part they carry'd him away by force out of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and u&s;ed him as a Slave every &s;ince; and he begg'd that we would receive him, and carry him into <HI>Holland.</HI> In the morning early the Pyrates mi&s;|&s;ing this fellow ha&s;ted away, two of our be&s;t Ships were order'd to go after them, but they could ne|ver come near them.</P>
<P>The 8th, The Admiral went on board with all his Retinue, only he left his Wife behind him; for what Rea&s;on we could not learn.</P>
<P>The 9th, Early in the morning, we hoi&s;ted up &s;ail and weigh'd Anchors. The Wind was very good for us at South-Ea&s;t; and we went by the <HI>Zee Honden</HI> or <HI>Banditen</HI> I&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="187">
One the 10th, We kept a day of Fa&s;ting and Hu|miliation.</P>
<P>On the 11th, There was a meeting of all the Ma&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to agree all of us upon certain &s;ignals to be given among&s;t us either by &s;hooting, lighting Fires, or hanging out of Flags, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From the 12th to the 16th, We had very uncer|tain Winds, and little for us. At that time we had &s;everal <HI>North-Capers</HI> about our Ships. They are a large &s;ort of Fi&s;h almo&s;t like a Whale. We held our cour&s;e We&s;tward and by South.</P>
<P>The 17th, We came into the Trade-winds, which blow con&s;tantly at North and We&s;t. We made directly toward the I&s;land of St. <HI>Helens,</HI> to be in|form'd there in what po&s;ture Affairs &s;tood in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The 20th of June, We came in &s;ight of that I&s;land; and being come on one &s;ide of it, where the Engli&s;h had a Fort, we order'd the <HI>Po&s;thorn</HI> to &s;ail clo&s;e by that Fort, to give them notice that we were Dutch, and came thither upon no other de|&s;ign than to ask &s;ome News about <HI>Europe.</HI> They an|&s;wer'd us that it was a general Peace every where at Sea. Upon which we very joyfully fired all our Can|non, which was all an&s;wer'd from the Engli&s;h Fort. We kept on in our cour&s;e We&s;t aud by North; the Winds &s;till continuing; and we left St. <HI>Helens</HI> on the left hand of us.</P>
<P>The 22th of July, We came under the Line, and very happily pa&s;s'd it, and lo&s;t but two Men, both of 'em Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 23th at night, We &s;aw again the Northern Star to our great Joy; till then we had only the Southern Cro&s;s in &s;ight, which is a Con|&s;tellation <FIGURE>

The 24th we met a Spani&s;h Ship that had a great many Women on Board, who were &s;ent into the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to People them: She was afraid of us, and would have e&s;caped, but our Admiral &s;oon fetch'd her back again.</P>
<P>The 25th we met an Engli&s;h Ship that had but one Ma&s;t, &s;he was Laden with Tobacco from <HI>Bra&s;il;</HI> we Barter'd with them, and gave a good quantity of Spices, Silks, Stuffs, and Linnen, for their Tobacco; but we were glad we could have it on any account. I for my part gave a great deal of Pepper and Cinnamon for half a pound of it.</P>
<P>The 26th, 27th, and 28th the Engli&s;hman kept by us, but on the 22th he left us with wonderful &s;wiftne&s;s, and got out of &s;ight immediately.</P>
<P>The 30th a great many flying Fi&s;hes fell down in our Ship, &s;ome of which we Eat, and the re&s;t we kept for a Rarity.</P>
<P>The 31&s;t abundance of Sea-hogs came through our Fleet, Swimming again&s;t the Wind. Our Gunner &s;hot one of them with an Elligar which is an In&s;trument that &s;ticks in the Fi&s;h it hits: it hath a Leaden weight at the But-end, which makes that end &s;ink, and with the other it turns up the Fi&s;h: As &s;oon as that one was made to bleed, all the others made away. That which we catch'd was Seven Foot long, and half that in compa&s;s; It was perfect Bacon, and had a deal of warm Blood.</P>
<P>The 1&s;t of Augu&s;t we went directly North|ward; the Wind was at South-We&s;t, and blew very cold. The Days were long, &s;o that we re&s;ted more by Day than by Night.</P>
<P>The 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th we had much Rain, with which we filled our Water-Barrels; the Wind too being &s;omething boi&s;te|rous, parted us: Our Ve&s;&s;el was ju&s;t going to Founder, and began to gape in &s;ome places half

a. Foot Wide. The Carpenters fell to Work, and were forced to bind up the Cracks and Chinks with Cords, Iron Bands, and Chains; and by our continual Pumping, we made &s;hift to keep the Ship up.</P>
<P>On the 8th we were forced to take in all our Sails, and let our Ship Drive; two Waves &s;truck into our Ship which would have certain|ly Sunk us, had not God's Mercy, together with our extream Diligence, happily freed us from the Danger.</P>
<P>We were at that time by our &s;elves, without either Friend or Foe near us. Our Cook had for &s;ome Days not been able to Dre&s;s us any Vi|ctuals for the To&s;&s;ing and Tumbling in our Ship, &s;o that we were forced to Eat Bacon that came from <HI>Bengal</HI> Raw, and afterwards help the Dige|&s;tion of it with Indian Brandy, of which we had good &s;tore.</P>
<P>The 9th we heard &s;everal great Pieces of Can|non Fired, but could not tell for what: In the Afternoon about two a Clock, we &s;aw at our Right Hand a large Ship; we found it was our Vice Admiral, and perceived by the Pendants that it was in danger of Sinking. We both en|deavoured to get up to one another, and the Ad|miral being come within reach of us, the Men on Board begg'd that we would &s;end our Long-Boat to help them.</P>
<P>They kept &s;till Calling, Bawling, and Firing, whil&s;t we were advi&s;ing whether we had be&s;t joyn them, or keep off&punc; For if they, being an Hundred and Fifty in Number, had all come over to us, we mu&s;t have &s;tarved; yet we de|&s;igned to be ready to take up as many as we could if their Ship had &s;unk: At la&s;t we re|&s;olved

that our Ma&s;ter, a very skilful Seaman &s;hould go to them, to &s;ee what condition they were in, and to give them his Advice. When he was come unto them, he advi&s;ed rhem to throw Over-board &s;ome of their Goods, as they de&s;igned to do before: So they unloaded the Ve&s;&s;el of near Four Hundred La&s;ts of Spices, as Cinnamon; Cloves, Nutmegs, Pepper, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> by which means they could come to &s;top the Leak, and &s;o at la&s;t they &s;aved them&s;elves. The Pepper being &s;cattered about, got into their Pumps, &s;o that they could not u&s;e them; the &s;ame thing hath often happened with us too.</P>
<P>The 10th, and 11th, The&s;e Stormy Winds a|bated. We began now to find it colder and colder, and the Fogs to ri&s;e again. In tho&s;e two days all our Fleet, except the <HI>Po&s;thorn,</HI> met a|gain.</P>
<P>The 12th, 13th, and 14th, The Fog was &s;o very thick, that we could not &s;ee one another, but were forced to Fire often, to know where we were all of us, that we might keep together.</P>
<P>The 15th, we met with an Engli&s;h Fi&s;herman that was coming from <HI>Y&s;land;</HI> he was loaden with Salt-fi&s;h: We truck'd with him for &s;ome of it.</P>
<P>The 16th, we pa&s;&s;ed by two Dutch Ve&s;&s;els go|ing home from the Whale-fi&s;hing in <HI>Greenland.</HI> Of the&s;e we got &s;ome Chee&s;e, Bisket, and To|bacco for Spices. One of them had catch'd ten Whales and the other Eleven, which is reckoned a good Voyage. The Men were very Lu&s;ty and Healthy, but we look'd all like Death, being almo&s;t quite &s;pent and worn out with the labour and trouble, our great danger had put us to. Being come now into the Latitude of Sixty one

<P>The 17th, Some Dutch Men of War came to meet us, with another Ship that brought Pro|vi&s;ions for our Ea&s;t-India Fleet, and accompani|ed us back.</P>
<P>The 18th in the Morning we came in &s;ight of <HI>Hitland,</HI> and kept as much as we could to|wards the Engli&s;h Shoar, according to the Or|ders we had received from the States of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> lea&s;t any Winds might have drove us into &s;ome ports of <HI>Norway,</HI> e&s;pecially becau&s;e the States were at that time at Variance with the King of <HI>Denmark:</HI> So we held to the North-Ea&s;t, and Ea&s;t-North-Ea&s;t, till</P>

Two of our Company &s;truck off the day before to go to <HI>Zeland.</HI> There came Pilots for each of our Ships, who brought us &s;afe through the <HI>Tonnen in the Vlic.</HI> Here were two of the chief Men of the Ea&s;t-India Com|pany in a Yatch, expecting of us, they wel|comed us all, and thanked us for the Faithful Service we had done them. They took as many of us as would go, to <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> but our Che&s;ts and Goods we were to leave behind us in the Ships.</P>
<P>On the 2d of September we came to <HI>Am&s;ter|dam.</HI> We were from the 14th of January to this time coming from <HI>Ceylon;</HI> which is Three Thou&s;and one Hundred Miles in Two Hun|dred and Thirty Two Days.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day our Che&s;ts and Beds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were brought into the Ea&s;t-India Hou&s;e, and there &s;earched by Men for that purpo&s;e. If nothing Prohibited, or worth above Two Month's Pay was found in them, it was Delivered &s;traight-way
