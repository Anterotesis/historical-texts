<P>_IT was the happie coun&s;ell of <HI>Scipio,</HI> the Noble and vallorous <HI>Romane</HI> in the graue Senate, for the reco|very of his lo&s;t coun|try, not to continue a Defen&s;iue Warre again&s;t <HI>Hanniball</HI> in <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> but rather to pa&s;&s;e with the Armie a|gain&s;t <HI>Carthage</HI> it &s;elfe, the fountaine of their troubled Vexation, as that which would be a meanes, at lea&s;t to draw their enemy from the gates of <HI>Rome</HI> into <HI>Affrica,</HI> to de|fend
<PB N="2" REF="3"> their owne Cittie of <HI>Carthage;</HI> Now of this advi&s;e he couragiou&s;ly vndertooke the performance him&s;elfe, at the com|mand of the State of <HI>Rome;</HI> and performed it mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;fully, to the &s;afetie of his Country; and his owne perpetuall ho|nour.</P>
<P>If this pollicy of his hath oftentimes beene accounted worthy of imitation in the &s;ucceeding Ages; and alwayes to de|&s;erue acclamation and pray&s;e; It is no &s;trange matter, nor need we to di&s;tru&s;t their courage, or their &s;ucce&s;&s;e, who at this day follow that cour&s;e of proceeding in their Warres, and therefore how&s;oever I doubt nothing at all, but that after the ioyning of <HI>Brun&s;wicks</HI> Army with the Count <HI>Mansfeilds,</HI> they might haue oppo|&s;ed the Enemies in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> if it had not tended to the vtter deva&s;tation of that poore Country, which hath langui|&s;hed &s;o long vnder the mi&s;erable burthen of &s;o great a Warre; yet for the pre&s;ervati|on of that remnant which is left, they haue now happily taken the way, to tran&s;port the warre, and con&s;equently, the mi&s;ery
<PB N="3" REF="3"> of it, into the Enemies owne Country, that they al&s;o may not be onely &s;pectators of others calamities, but may at length ta&s;te of the &s;ame Sauce they haue &s;erved others withall, by a forced contribution at lea&s;t of &s;uch money, munition, and meanes as for &s;uch a populous Armie is requi&s;ite; of which its very probable, they had &s;ome wants, by rea&s;on of the di&s;ordered Di&s;a&s;tar, which befell the <HI>Brun&s;wickers</HI> in pa&s;&s;ing the River of <HI>Maine,</HI> where as its &s;ayd, much Baggage was lo&s;t, and &s;ome men. Now, I &s;ay, for to furni&s;h them&s;elues againe with nece&s;|&s;aries, and to reinforce their Armie, by &s;ome new &s;upplyes from the <HI>Switzers,</HI> and other friends; haue they taken their way into <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and &s;o proceed, as this fol|lowing Relation doth amply declare.</P>
