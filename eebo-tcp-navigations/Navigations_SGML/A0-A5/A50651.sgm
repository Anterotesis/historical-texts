<P N="4">4. Let him al&s;o before he go, learn &s;ome knowledge in the Art of <HI>Co&s;mography,</HI> for if he be ignorant of that, he will not know where he is, nor which foot to &s;et forward: And al&s;o if he de&s;ire to learn the Lan|guage of each Kingdom, (that is in mo&s;t u&s;e in his own Countrey) let him re&s;ort to tho&s;e places where the be&s;t Language is &s;poken; tho&s;e are, <HI>Leipzich</HI> in <HI>Germany, Orleance</HI> in

<HI>Autumn;</HI> and he &s;hall do well to go to cold Climes in Sum|mer, and hot Climes in Winter: And if the journey he takes be long, let him not acquaint, no not his Companions nor Friends in his jour|ney, the furthe&s;t end thereof, but rather from City to City, and pro|fe&s;s <PB N="349" REF="184"> he intends to go no further; and in&s;tead of a Companion, let him have alwayes &s;uch Books as may fitly accord with his travels, which he may carry without danger.</P>

<P N="7">7.

<P N="7">7. Likewi&s;e I advi&s;e a Traveller to be &s;o wary whereever he comes, not to venture on any new thing, till the example of another give him confi|dence.

<P N="8">8. And as a Traveller ought to have a &s;low tongue, and his mind locked up, &s;o let him have a clear and chearfull countenance; let him &s;peak &s;paringly, and &s;eldom &s;peak of his own Commonwealth, or private E&s;tate, or good qualities; and let him take this for a general Rule, that nothing doth more pre&s;erve a Traveller out of dangers, or &s;ooner deliver him in danger, than a mode|rate and di&s;creet u&s;e of his tongue; let him &s;hun a talkative companion, or not &s;eem to hear their que&s;tions; let him not enquire after the &s;ecrets of Religion, nor de&s;ire to be pre&s;ent at tho&s;e Rites.
