<P>Soon after the Ri&s;ing of the Parliament, it was generally reported, Regulations were agreed on, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Late Com|pany,

<P>A New Charter was thereupon ordered to be prepared, and it was given out, <HI>That all Per&s;ons were &s;atisfied with, and agreed to the&s;e Regulations,</HI> and particularly, that they were approved of by all, or the mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who had been entru&s;ted to procure the Settlement of this Trade, in a New Company, e&s;tabli&s;ht by Act of Parliament.</P>

<P>Sheweth,</P>
<P><HI>THat the Petitioners, with many others, (after</HI> their humble Application <HI>first made to Your Maje&s;ty) did prefer their Petitions to the Commons of</HI> England <HI>in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, the two last Se&s;&s;ions,</HI> for the E&s;tabli&s;hing a New <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-India <HI>Company,</HI> and pre|&s;erving that Trade to the Nation: <HI>whereupon two Addre&s;&s;es to Your Maje&s;ty, en&s;ued from the &s;aid Hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now in as much as the Petitioners do most humbly conceive, That &s;uch an</HI> E&s;tabli&s;hment by a New, Free, and National Sub&s;cription, <HI>for the Rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient and real Fund to carry on that Trade, would be of</HI> great Advantage to this Kingdom, <HI>and most acceptable

<P><HI>The Petitioners therefore mo&s;t humbly Pray, That Your Maje&s;ty (out of Your Princely Care for the Good of Your People) would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to take the &s;ame into Con&s;ideration: &s;o that</HI> the afore|&s;aid Mi&s;chiefs <HI>may be prevented, and</HI> all Your Maje&s;ties Subjects made Partakers of the Benefit of that Trade upon Equal Terms.</P>

<P>The Company neverthele&s;s <HI>made Default</HI> in Paying the fir&s;t quarterly Payment, of the &s;aid Tax, on the 25 of <HI>March,</HI> being the day limited in that Act; whereby their <HI>Charters became ab|&s;olutely Void:</HI> which put a &s;top to the further proceeding of their intended New Charter.</P>
<P>Hereupon it was generally concluded, This Accident would have given a favourable Opportunity for the &s;peedy Settlement of that Trade, on &s;uch a Foundation as the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> had de&s;ired, and the <HI>Nation</HI> expected; which had before been &s;o long Ob&s;tru|cted by the <HI>Late Company;</HI> &s;eeing they were now Di&s;&s;olved by their own Act, and thereby the difficulty of the Three Years Warning was wholly removed.</P>

<P>But tho&s;e Hopes were &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated; Orders being given, for the drawing a New Charter, to Re&s;tore to the <HI>Late Company</HI> not only their former Grants, but to e&s;tabli&s;h new Regulations, ap|pointing 756000 <HI>l.</HI> to be added by new Sub&s;criptions, to their &s;uppo&s;ed 744000 <HI>l.</HI> without any Security to be given, <HI>to make their Stock worth it;</HI> &mdash; in like manner as it was re&s;olved to have been done, if their Charters had not been Forfeited.</P>
<P>Upon which, tho&s;e who had been entru&s;ted to obtain the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a New <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company by Act of Parliament, entred <HI>Caveats</HI> at all the Offices, again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;ing any Grant to the &s;aid Company; that &s;o nothing might be wanting on their parts to Oppo&s;e it. But the Difficulties were &s;o great, in Modelling &s;uch a <HI>Charter</HI> as was propo&s;ed, that after &s;ome time &s;pent, at la&s;t it was judged mo&s;t practicable, and expeditious; fir&s;t, to Grant a Charter of Incorporation and Re&s;toration; and afterwards, to add to it the other intended Regulations.</P>
<P>Notice was &s;ent to tho&s;e who were concerned in the <HI>Caveats,</HI> that they might attend the Right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Notting|ham,</HI> on Monday the 31 of <HI>July,</HI> and be heard, as to what they had to &s;ay again&s;t the Pa&s;&s;ing the Grant to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, which was then before his Lord&s;hip: At which time <HI>&s;everal Mer|chants</HI> attended his Lord&s;hip on both &s;ides, whom his Lord&s;hip made acquainted with the Contents of that Grant; a Copy of which was de&s;ired; by tho&s;e who were concerned in the <HI>Caveats;</HI> and that &s;ome time might be allowed them, to make &s;uch Exce|ptions as they &s;hould be advi&s;ed were Nece&s;&s;ary, and (the Company con&s;enting) a Copy was granted, which was delivered the next day in the Evening; and the &s;ame Afternoon Her Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure was &s;ignified, That tho&s;e who did Oppo&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ing the Grant to the <HI>East-India</HI> Company, &s;hould be heard before <HI>Her Maje&s;ty</HI> in Council, the Thur&s;day following. &mdash; They attended accordingly, and having informed Her Maje&s;ty, That they could not po&s;&s;ibly In&s;truct their Coun&s;el, or be ready them&s;elves at <HI>&s;o &s;hort a warning,</HI> to give Her Maje&s;ty the Satisfaction which was nece&s;&s;ary in a matter of &s;o great concern, <HI>they Humbly Prayed</HI> 14 days longer time; to which Her Maje&s;ty was graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to conde&s;cend, and Ordered that all Per&s;ons &s;hould attend the 17 day of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> as appears by the following Order.</P>

<P><HI>THE Petitioners, by rea&s;on of</HI> the pre&s;ent War, <HI>did Humbly Be&s;eech</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Protection for</HI> 400 <HI>Seamen, to go in Five Ships to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies, <HI>in humble confidence of</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Granting the &s;ame: for that, (as the Petitioners are advi&s;ed)</HI> that Trade is Free, by the Laws of this Land, to all the Subjects of England. <HI>In which they find them&s;elves Ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e, who being but</HI> private Per&s;ons, <HI>are in the &s;ame Condition with the rest of</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Subjects; and yet do a&s;&s;ume to them&s;elves</HI> the Name and Power of a Corporation, <HI>tho' they are actually</HI> Di&s;&s;olved by Act of Parliament; <HI>which is</HI> the highe&s;t Judgment <HI>can be given again&s;t them.

<P>As to the Allegation <HI>made by the Re&s;pondents, That</HI> the Que&s;tion now is, <HI>Whether the Petitioners &s;hall have Liberty to Trade in</HI> a Joint-Stock, <HI>or otherwi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Petitioners humbly Reply, <HI>That that is</HI> no part of the Que&s;tion; <HI>in regard the matter in di&s;pute is,</HI> Whether all <HI>Your Maje&s;ties</HI> Subjects have not an Equal Right to that Trade; and Whether they can be Legally Excluded from the &s;ame but by an Act of Parliament? <HI>And becau&s;e the Re&s;pondents have in&s;inuated,</HI> in their own Commendation, <HI>That they have Managed that Trade</HI> to
<PB N="23" REF="12">the Honour of the Nation: <HI>The Petitionors do averr, and are ready to prove, That <HI>their Unju&s;t and Unwarrantable Actions,</HI> have been &s;uch as have tended <HI>to the Scandal of our Religion, to the Di&s;honour of the Crown and Nation, the Reproach of our Laws, the Oppre&s;&s;ion of the People, and the Lo&s;s of the Trade it &s;elf:</HI> For &s;ome of which,</HI> they and their Agents have been ju&s;tly Cen&s;ured in Parliament. &mdash; <HI>But to follow the Re&s;pondents in their own Method.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Petition, <HI>relating to the</HI> Charter <HI>now lying before</HI> Your Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Petitioners in all humility Reply, <HI>That the Re&s;pondents have endeavoured</HI> to Evade the main Scope thereof; <HI>which was not (as they in&s;inuate) only to &s;uspend the Pa&s;&s;ing of the</HI> Charter, <HI>but</HI> that the Petitioners Right to the Freedom of that Trade might be determined by a due cour&s;e of Law: <HI>In order to which, the Pe|titioners offered to Join</HI> in a &s;peedy Trial, <HI>which would &s;ettle this matter; and the Respondents avoiding it,</HI> plainly argues their own Conviction, <HI>that</HI> the Law is again&s;t them; <HI>which makes them de|cline that Method of a</HI> Legal Determination, <HI>by which the common Rights of all Men are, and ought to be decided: and therefore en|deavour to draw it into que&s;tion before</HI> Your Maje&s;ty <HI>in Council;</HI> where they them&s;elves know it cannot be determined. <HI>But the Petitioners, in humble Confidence of</HI> Your Maje&s;ties Ju&s;tice, <HI>hope that</HI> Your Maje&s;ty <HI>will not deprive them and the re&s;t of</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Subjects of their Right thereunto: For that the Petitioners are advi&s;ed,</HI> That not only the Executing &s;uch Prohibitory Powers, but even the very Obtaining them, are criminal, and puni&s;hable by Law.</P>
<P>As to the Fir&s;t <HI>of the Eight Points in&s;i&s;ted on by the Respondents, viz.</HI> The Nature of the Avoidance of their Charters, <HI>by Act of Parliament,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Petitioners humbly Reply, <HI>That the de&s;ired Charter is not &s;o properly</HI> a Re&s;tauration <HI>of the Late Company, as</HI> a New Creation; <HI>and that</HI> a Corporation, <HI>when once Void (as in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e) cannot be Restored by a Charter of Restauration; but mu&s;t be done either by</HI> an Act of Parliament, <HI>or</HI> a Charter of New Creation,&mdash; <HI>and &s;o is the Scope of the Grant now de&s;ired. And as to the Respondents Pre|tence, That the Intention of the Parliament was not to Di&s;&s;olve them:</HI> 'Tis mo&s;t evident, <HI>That the</HI> Parliament <HI>did Intend, that their Failure of Payment at the day, &s;hould Determin their Charter;</HI> for that the
<PB N="24" REF="13">time of Payment is made peremptory and penal, <HI>by the words and meaning of the &s;aid Act; and no</HI> Averrment, <HI>in any ca&s;e,</HI> ought to be Received out of Parliament, to Con&s;true an Act of Parliament, contrary to the expre&s;s Letter of it; <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> where the Par|liament who made the Act is in being, and like to be &s;o &s;oon A&s;&s;embled again. <HI>But the</HI> indu&s;trious and eager Application <HI>of the Respondents, for a Charter to Pa&s;s,</HI> when the Se&s;&s;ion is &s;o very near; <HI>plainly &s;hews, they are convinced, That the</HI> Parliament <HI>had no &s;uch Intention, whatever they may pretend: For,</HI> the Hou&s;e of Commons was &s;o far from di&s;covering the lea&s;t Intention to con|tinue them, when they were a Company; <HI>much le&s;s to Re&s;tore them, now they are not;</HI> that they have twice &s;olemnly Addre&s;&s;ed to <HI>His Majesty,</HI> to Di&s;&s;olve them: <HI>and in the whole time that this matter was depending before them,</HI> 'tis ob&s;ervable, they did not make any the lea&s;t &s;tep which tended to their Continuance.&mdash; <HI>Moreover, the restle&s;s Importunity of the Respondents for a Charter at this time, is</HI> the more un&s;ea&s;onable: <HI>in regard</HI> His Maje&s;ty <HI>declared,</HI> in His Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;e of Commons <HI>the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, <HI>That the Di&s;&s;olving the Late Company,</HI> and constituting</HI> a New one, <HI><HI>tho' nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve this Trade, could not be perfected by His own Authority alone, without the concurrence of the Parliament, to make it complear and u&s;eful.</HI> And for that rea&s;on having commanded all the Proceedings in that matter to be laid before them,</HI> His Maje&s;ty referred it to their Settlement; <HI>who being prevented by the Companies great Oppo&s;ition,</HI> Addre&s;&s;ed to the King the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, to Determin the Charter; <HI>re&s;erving the Settlement of that Trade to them&s;elves,</HI> as <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> had graciou&s;ly Referred it: <HI>And this</HI> zealous Application <HI>of the Respondents, for a Charter to pa&s;s</HI> &s;o nigh the Se&s;&s;ion, can be no other than a De&s;ign in them, to take the Settlement of that Trade out of tho&s;e very hands, to which <HI>His Majesty</HI> did &s;o expre&s;ly commit it. <HI>Therefore it &s;eems a great failure in the Respondents, of that Duty they owe to</HI> Your Maje&s;ty, To pre&s;s &s;o earne&s;tly <HI>the Pa&s;&s;ing a Charter;</HI> in direct oppo&s;ition to the declared Sence, and repeated de&s;ires of the Commons in Parliament, <HI>&s;o nigh the time of their Meeting.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Re&s;pondents pretence of Equity, <HI>in ca&s;e of Penalties and Forfeitures,</HI> &mdash; the Petitioners humbly Reply; <HI>That tho' there can be</HI> no Equity again&s;t the penalty of an Act of Parliament; <HI>yet the forfeited Estate of the Late Company being now</HI> Your Maje|&s;ties, <HI>may be Re&s;tored to them at</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> without any &s;uch Charter as is de&s;ired; <HI>if</HI> Your Maje&s;ty <HI>&s;hall think fit &s;o far to remit the Forfeiture; which, with humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, is all
<PB N="25" REF="13">the equity they can pretend to.</HI> &mdash; And if <HI>their Estate be &s;o valuable,</HI> as they alledge it is, Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Remitting their Forfeiture as to that, will be</HI> &s;o great a Grace and Bounty toward them, <HI>that they will</HI> have no rea&s;on to urge the Payment of their Tax, <HI>as an Argument for a New Charter;</HI> or any ways to regret the Payment' thereof. &mdash; <HI>And becau&s;e the Respondents have endeavoured to excu&s;e their Non-payment, alledging,</HI> the Exchequer was &s;hut; and that their Money was ready, had the Officers been there to Receive it. <HI>The Petitioners</HI> cannot but Ob&s;erve, <HI>That</HI> all their other Alle|gations <HI>are made</HI> the le&s;s creditable, by the in&s;incerity of this. <HI>For when this Matter was referred by</HI> Your Maje&s;ty <HI>to be Examined, it did plainly appear by the Testimony of &s;ome of</HI> the Principal Officers <HI>in the Receipt of</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Exchequer; taken in the pre&s;ence of &s;everal of</HI> the Re&s;pondents them&s;elves, <HI>and afterwards con|firmed by the Affidavits of &s;everal of the</HI> Under-officers, <HI>now ready to be produced:</HI> That the Office-doors were open on the 25th of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, during the u&s;ual Hours; that the Officers were at|tending in their Places, that Publick Bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;patched, and that the Re&s;pondents Money would have been Received, if it had been Tendred: <HI>Which Mi&s;repre&s;entation of this Matter to</HI> Your Maje&s;ty, <HI>is</HI> a great Pre&s;umption <HI>in the Respondents. <HI>Be&s;ides,</HI> their</HI> eager pre&s;&s;ing for a New Charter, <HI>is a &s;ufficient Argument of</HI> their Self-conviction, <HI>That their Money was neither Paid nor Ten|dred at the time appointed; and con&s;equently,</HI> That their Charters are Void.</P>
<P>As to the Second Allegation <HI>in the &s;aid An&s;wer, wherein the Re&s;pondents charge the Petitioners to in&s;ist; That &s;uch Restitu|tion, and</HI> Grant of the Sole Trade, <HI>is</HI> again&s;t Law; <HI>and do a&s;&s;ert</HI> the Power of the Prerogative, in Granting a Sole Trade to &s;ome, with Exclu&s;ion to others.</P>
<P>Fora&s;much <HI>as the Respondents do urge</HI> the Power of the Prero|gative, to Ob&s;truct <HI>the Petitioners in the Exerci&s;e of</HI> their Lawful <HI>Trade; the Petitioners humbly beg</HI> Your Maje&s;ties Grace and Favour, <HI>to permit them</HI> to &s;tand upon the Law, in the Ju&s;t Defence of their Right thereunto. <HI>And tho' the Respondents endeavour to Justifie, under</HI> the Prerogative, <HI>the Lawfulne&s;s of &s;uch a Grant; yet they have not quoted</HI> any Legal Authorities <HI>for it; nor any Practice more Antient than in the Reign of Queen</HI> Elizabeth, <HI>when</HI> the Fir&s;t <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Charter <HI>was Granted; which was only for Fifteen Years, (as was u&s;ual in ca&s;e of a New Invention,) but could give it</HI> no Legal Authority, <HI>if it were</HI> in it &s;elf Illegal: <HI>&s;eeing many things formerly
<PB N="26" REF="14">done of that kind, have been afterwards que&s;tioned, and adjudged Illegal</HI> in Parliament. <HI>But the Petitioners are &s;o well a&s;&s;ured of Your Maje&s;ties</HI> Ju&s;tice, <HI>that the Example of none of</HI> Your Royal Predece&s;&s;ors <HI>can be any Argument to</HI> Your Maje&s;ty, <HI>for the</HI> Pa&s;&s;ing any Grant, except it be Legal. <HI>And though &s;uch Prohibiting Patents were fir&s;t Granted toward the latter end of</HI> that <HI>Queens</HI> Reign, <HI>yet when the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of them came to be taken notice of,</HI> a very &s;evere Law <HI>was made in the very next Reign, again&s;t all &s;uch Prohibitions, called,</HI> the Statute of Monopolies; <HI>which did but</HI> a&s;&s;ert and declare, <HI>that which was before <HI>the Ancient and Com|mon Law of the Land;</HI></HI> the Benefit of which Common Law, <HI>the Petitioners humbly Claim <HI>as their undoubted Hight:</HI> by virtue whereof, all</HI> Your Maje&s;ties Subjects are <HI>(as they are advi&s;ed)</HI> equally entituled to the Freedom of Foreign Trade; <HI>and humbly conceive,</HI> cannot be re&s;trained from it, by colour of any Grant from the Crown: <HI>Which Liberty of Trade hath been al&s;o a&s;&s;erted and confirmed <HI>by Magna Charta,</HI></HI> and many other Statutes. &mdash; <HI>And becau&s;e the Respondents,</HI> by way of Reflection, <HI>have alledged, That the &s;aid Statutes have been mi&s;understood and mi&s;applied by the Petitioners. They therefore</HI> crave leave to annex hereunto, <HI>not only an Abstract of divers of</HI> the &s;aid Statutes, <HI>but al&s;o of</HI> &s;ome few <HI>of tho&s;e</HI> numerous Authorities of Common Law, <HI>whereby the Li|berty of &s;uch Trade is A&s;&s;erted. All which they Humby Offer to</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Pretence <HI>of the &V;nlawfulne&s;s of Trading with Infidels: the Petiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ners think it &s;o mean, that it &s;carce de&s;erves an An&s;wer;</HI> being a meer <HI>Chimaera</HI> of Popi&s;h Original, <HI>without any other Foun|dation. However, they crave leave to Affirm, That</HI> no Law of England <HI>makes it Criminal to Buy Goods</HI> of a Jew, <HI>or to Sell them</HI> to a Pagan; <HI>and by their being permitted</HI> to inhabit among us, <HI>we daily Conver&s;e and Trade with them, and they with us. &mdash; But &s;up|po&s;ing &s;uch Trade were</HI> Criminal by Law, <HI>as the Respondents in&s;inuate, (tho' it is not) yet the Charter they de&s;ire must be Illegal; in that it would amount to</HI> a Di&s;pen&s;ing with the Common Law; <HI>which is</HI> again&s;t the Bill of Rights, and the true Con&s;titution of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government. <HI>But</HI> the pre&s;umption <HI>of the Respondents is very re|markable in this, That they have ventured to Cite for</HI> an Authority of Law, <HI>that which they style</HI> the Solemn Judgment in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>-Hall; <HI>which never had <HI>any Credit</HI> among</HI> the Learned in that Profe&s;&s;ion. &mdash; <HI>And therefore,</HI> to quote the Judgment only of tho&s;e Per&s;ons for Law, <HI>who have been</HI> &s;o far Cen&s;ured in Parlia|ment, <HI>as to be Excepted out of</HI> the La&s;t Act of Indemnity, <HI>for the</HI> open perverting and violating thereof; <HI>is &s;o far from being an
<PB N="27" REF="14">Argument</HI> for the Legality of their Patent, <HI>that (with humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion) it is really and truly</HI> a Great Argument <HI>against it: And the Re&s;pondents Petitioning</HI> the Hou&s;e of Commons, <HI>&s;everal times, &s;ince</HI> that Unwarrantable Judgment, <HI>to have</HI> this Trade re&s;trained to them&s;elves by Act of Parliament: <HI>plainly &s;hews,</HI> They were convinced, <HI>That neither</HI> that Judgment, <HI>nor</HI> their Charter, were &s;ufficient to Re&s;train that Trade, without an Act of Parliament.</P>

<P>THE Petitioners <HI>Humbly Reply,</HI> That the Re&s;pondents in their An&s;wer, would excu&s;e them&s;elves for not Exporting greater quantities of <HI>Cloth;</HI> by pretending, that <HI>Your Maje&s;ty</HI> allowing them no more Ships in 1689 and 1690, was the rea&s;on of it; but the years 1691 and 1692, when <HI>Your Majesty</HI> granted them more Shipping, they had Exported in each Year to the value of 100000 <HI>l. in Cloth and other Goods of the product of</HI> England; and that they will Export the like value this year, <HI>in Woollen Cloth, and other Goods of the Growth, Product, and Manufacture of this Kingdom;</HI> &s;o as they may obtain a &s;ufficient Number of Shipping.</P>
<Q><HI>The Contrary where of may appear</HI> to <HI>Your Maje&s;ty,</HI> by what the Petitioners beg leave to Ob&s;erve to <HI>Your Maje&s;ty,</HI> as follows.</Q>
<P>For the Petitioners find upon Enquiry, That they Exported in the year 1688/89 but 243 and &frac12; <HI>Cloths.</HI></P>
<P>And in two years, <HI>viz.</HI> 1689/90 and 1690/91, they Exported no <HI>Cloth</HI> at all.</P>
<Q>So that in tho&s;e three years, <HI>viz.</HI> 1688/89, and 1689/90, and 1690/91, they Exported but 243&frac12; <HI>Cloths.</HI> Although in tho&s;e three years they &s;ent out <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Ships,</HI> containing <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Tunns.</HI></Q>
<P><HI>Which &s;hews plainly,</HI> It was not the Want of <HI>Your Majesties</HI> Granting them more Ships, that hindred their Exporting greater quantities of <HI>Cloth;</HI> but <HI>&s;ome other Rea&s;on, which they Conceal.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1691/92, they Exported 918 <HI>Cloths.</HI></P>
<P>And in the year 1692/93, they Exported but 546 <HI>Cloths.</HI></P>
<P>And their not mentioning particularly the Quantities of <HI>Cloth</HI> which they Exported, <HI>&s;hews, they were A&s;hamed</HI> (as well they might)
<PB N="43" REF="23"><HI>it &s;hould be known, they had Exported &s;o &s;mall quantities, to &s;upply &s;o large a Trade:</HI> Which is an Argument to enforce the Petitioners Prayer, That all <HI>Your Maje&s;ties</HI> Subjects may have <HI>the Liberty,</HI> freely to Export <HI>Cloth</HI> thither: <HI>And the rather,</HI> for that the Pe|titioners find, there was 953 <HI>Cloths</HI> Exported in the two Ships which went to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> la&s;t year, <HI>for Private Accounts:</HI> which was near <HI>three times as much Cloth</HI> as the Company had Ex|ported <HI>for Three Years Trade;</HI> Viz. in 1688/89, and 1689/90, and 1690/91; and was &s;o much more than would have been Exported, if tho&s;e Ships had not gone thither.</P>
<Q>And as to the Pretence of their Exporting this Year the Value of 100000 l. <HI>in Cloth, and other Goods of the Product of</HI> Eng|land, if they may obtain a Sufficient Number of Shipping.</Q>
<P>It will appear to be <HI>of very little weight,</HI> when it's con&s;idered, <HI>how little Cloth</HI> they have Exported thither <HI>in their Four la&s;t Years Trade;</HI> of which the whole Value doth not amount to above <HI>One Fifth Part of the Sum,</HI> which they pretend they will Export this Year; although <HI>they had a Sufficient Number of Shipping</HI> in tho&s;e Years. And the Petitioners have great Rea&s;on to Believe, and are ready to Prove, That all the other Merchandizes, <HI>of the Growth and Manufacture of</HI> England, which they Exported in tho&s;e years, <HI>did not amount to more than the Cloth.</HI></P>
<P>And the Petitioners being certain, they could now Sell great quantities of <HI>Cloth</HI> to other Merchants <HI>for the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies, <HI>if a Liberty were allowed to all</HI> Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Subjects, freely to Export it thither:</HI> Do therefore Humbly Pray <HI>Your Maje&s;ty,</HI> That <HI>a Free Exportation of Cloth</HI> for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> may be Allowed <HI>to All Your Maje&s;ties Subjects</HI> at this time; for that the Exportation of the &s;aid <HI>Manufacture,</HI> is in a manner <HI>wholly Interrupted, by rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent Ob&s;truction of Trade for</HI> Turkey <HI>and the</HI> Streights.</P>

<P><HI>The Late Companyes</HI> want of Stock at Home <HI>is Vi&s;ible</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>BY their having &s;ent out to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>in three whole Years time of their Tade,</HI> Viz. <HI>in</HI> 1689, 1690, <HI>and</HI> 1691 in 7 Ships containing about 3000 Tuns, but the value of 26000 l. as may ap|pear by their Accounts laid before the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> in 1689 and 1691, of which mo&s;t part was <HI>Ammunitions and Stores</HI> for their <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>By their having in England</HI> but 38901 <HI>l.</HI> 8 <HI>s.</HI> 8 <HI>d.</HI> according to their own Accounts given in to Parliament in 1691, including 9920 <HI>l.</HI> for their Buildings, though they had &s;ent out &s;o little in the preceding Three Years, and had had above 10000 Tuns of their Shipping arrived in that time, <HI>whereas in Truth</HI> three times that Summ <HI>would not have paid the Debts which they then Owed,</HI> and made good the other mi&s;takes omitted to be in&s;erted in that Account.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>By their Farming out their Trade</HI> to and from the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies,</HI> to be carried on by Foreigners and others on Permi&s;&s;ion, on their Ships, and <HI>not Trading them&s;elves,</HI> when <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods were &s;o much <HI>wanted there,</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods &s;o exce&s;&s;ive <HI>&s;carce and dear here,</HI> which it can never be &s;uppo&s;ed they would have done, if they had had effects either <HI>at home or abroad,</HI> to carry on the Trade them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>By their calling in</HI> 50 per cent. of their Stock, before they could &s;end out the la&s;t Years Ships, which was <HI>a Publick Confe&s;&s;ion</HI> of their own, that they had not <HI>Stock &s;ufficient</HI> to carry on their Trade without it.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>By their having no Money in</HI> England to carry on their Trade, notwith&s;tanding the &s;aid 50 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> called in, that not being &s;ufficient <HI>to PAY what they Owed</HI> before it was cal|led in.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>By their Shipping out in Five Years of that Trade,</HI> &s;o little <HI>Cloth,</HI> as has in all that Time amounted to but about 20000 <HI>l.</HI> and not
<PB N="54" REF="29">near &s;o much in all other Goods of the Growth, Product, or Manufacture of <HI>England,</HI> which &s;hews, either that <HI>they wanted Mo|ney to Pay for them;</HI> or <HI>That they had little regard to the Publick Good of the Nation</HI> in the pro&s;ecution of their Trade.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>By the Engro&s;&s;ing the Goods</HI> (which have come home,) by <HI>the Ruling Members,</HI> who <HI>Sold them to them&s;elves,</HI> knowing the Company had not a Stock to &s;upply the Nation with tho&s;e Com|modities, thereby <HI>inhan&s;ing the Prizes</HI> to &s;uch extravagant Rates.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>By their not &s;upplying the Nation with</HI> Salt-Peter, although the &s;afety <HI>of the Kingdom</HI> &s;o much depends thereon, that Com|modity by rea&s;on of its &s;carcene&s;s for want of their Importing it, being <HI>now &s;old at near Four times the u&s;ual Price.</HI></P>
<P>Their Want of Stock abroad is al&s;o Vi&s;ible,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>By their Factors having &s;ent home in a few years</HI> about 2000 Tuns of their Shipping <HI>empty.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>By their having kept their Ships &s;o long in</HI> India, when <HI>East-India</HI> Goods were &s;o much wanted at home. One of the&s;e Ships now lately arrived, having been <HI>Five Years Out:</HI> And Three of tho&s;e &s;ent out in 1689 and 1690 not being yet returned; be&s;ides above 1200 Tuns of other Shipping which they had formerly &s;ent out, and which they would, as they might, have laded home, <HI>if they had not wanted Money, there</HI> more than Ships.</P>

And although by their Account given in Parliament in 1691, they pretended to have there about 200000 <HI>l.</HI> after all Debts paid; <HI>yet they are &s;o far from having any Stock at all there,</HI> That they <HI>are forced to Borrow Money to pay for the nece&s;&s;ary Charges of their Factory;</HI> as the Petitioners can prove by per&s;ons of undoubted Credit, lately come from thence, who ar|rived here but in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>By their Starving the Trade,</HI> having had home in <HI>Two</HI> Years but <HI>Three</HI> Ships, containing not above <HI>One Thou&s;and Tuns</HI> (though they have <HI>&s;o many Ships abroad,</HI> and that <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods are <HI>&s;o much wanted at home,</HI>) and even the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> Ships, a great part Laden by <HI>Armenians and others on Permi&s;&s;ion</HI> for private Accounts,

<P>By all which it may <HI>plainly appear</HI> to Your Maje&s;ty, That <HI>the late Company</HI> have <HI>neither Stock at home nor abroad,</HI> to carry on that Trade; but on the contrary, <HI>are va&s;tly Indebted there,</HI> as has been already Ob&s;erved to Your Maje&s;ty: <HI>Notwith&s;tanding,</HI> that by their Accounts given in Parliament, in 1691, they pretended that they had 828860 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>quick-&s;tock</HI> in the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> after all Debts and Demands were paid and &s;atisfied; and that they have not had home from thence near the value of 100000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ince that time; and for <HI>want of their Stock</HI> to manage this Trade, Your Maje&s;ty has &s;uf|fered in a very few years la&s;t pa&s;t, at lea&s;t 300000 <HI>l.</HI> in <HI>Your Cu|stoms,</HI> and that Trade is in a manner <HI>quite lo&s;t to this Kingdom, and given away to the <HI>Dutch;</HI></HI> who do not only <HI>&s;upply them&s;elves directly from the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies, with tho&s;e Goods which they formerly had from <HI>England; but do furni&s;h other Countries,</HI> which we were u&s;ed to &s;upply; and even the Con&s;umption of this Kingdom it &s;elf is now chiefly &s;upplied with <HI>East-India</HI> Commodities <HI>by &s;tealth from</HI> Hol|land.

<P>But the <HI>Ill Intentions of the late Company</HI> are the more apparent; for that though they them&s;elves have been able <HI>to drive &s;o little Trade to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies for &s;everal years la&s;t pa&s;t; yet <HI>they would ob&s;truct others</HI> Your Maje&s;ties Subjects from Trading thither; there|by endeavouring <HI>to le&s;&s;en Your Majesties Cu&s;toms,</HI> and to <HI>give away this Trade from our own to &s;ome other Nation.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>By the &s;everal Judgments</HI> which have been given in <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter-Hall,</HI> &s;ince their Maje&s;ties Happy Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, <HI>again&s;t the &s;topping Ships bound to the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies; and again&s;t the &s;eizing of Ships and Goods by colour of <HI>&s;uch Excluding Charters,</HI> for Trading to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> and <HI>Guiney,</HI> within the limits of them, thereby declaring it Lawful for the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> to Trade into the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>Guinney,</HI> notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e Charters, and without any particular Licen&s;e from the King for &s;o doing.</P>
<P N="3">3. By <HI>His Maje&s;ties Me&s;&s;age,</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion, in an&s;wer to their Addre&s;s of the former Se&s;&s;ion, for Di&s;|&s;olving the late Company, wherein its declared, <HI>That he could not &s;ettle it by his own Authority alone, and that the Concurrence of the Parliament is nece&s;&s;ary to make a compleat and u&s;eful Settlement of this Trade.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To Conclude,</HI> a <HI>&s;hort Bill for the Declaring and A&s;&s;erting the Right of the Subject, to the Freedom of Foreign Trade,</HI> might be Pa&s;t &s;peedily, without ob&s;truction to the other <HI>Publick Affairs,</HI> and might be a means to facilitate the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new Company, for the carrying on <HI>this Trade,</HI> by a new <HI>National Joint-Stock,</HI> to be rai&s;ed by <HI>new Sub&s;criptions</HI> (if the Wi&s;dom of the Parliament &s;hall think that the be&s;t method) for the future carrying on of this Trade.</P>
<P>This would remove tho&s;e Difficulties and Oppo&s;itions which have hitherto prevented that &s;ettlement, <HI>by making the oppo&s;ite Par|ties Concur</HI> in their endeavours to obtain it; and would be a means
<PB N="68" REF="36">effectually <HI>to &s;ecure that Trade from being lo&s;t,</HI> until &s;uch a &s;ettle|ment of it can be made as <HI>the Parliament &s;hall judge most beneficial to this Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>One great Objection urged by the Favourers of the <HI>Company,</HI> again&s;t &s;uch a Freedom of Trade, is, <HI>That it will spoil the Trade,</HI> which therefore de&s;erves to be con&s;idered; But its very remarka|ble, <HI>if they are ask't how the Trade will be &s;poilt?</HI> whither the Trade will not be carried on? our Manufacture Exported? and <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dia</HI> Goods Imported? They will allow all the&s;e will be done in an open Trade: But how then will the Trade be &s;poilt? <HI>The An|&s;wer is obvious,</HI> ju&s;t as it would &s;poil any other <HI>Monopoly,</HI> who have <HI>the &s;ole Buying and &s;ole Selling</HI> of any Commodity, if others were admitted to &s;ell the &s;ame; they mu&s;t be content to get le&s;s; <HI>Engli&s;h Goods</HI> will be &s;old cheaper there, and <HI>East-India Goods</HI> will be &s;old cheaper here; And if this he the Ca&s;e, as its plain it is, <HI>&s;uch a Freedom of Trade</HI> would make the Trade better for the Publick, though it might be wor&s;e for tho&s;e that drive it.</P>
