<HEAD>A new and large Di&s;cour&s;e, of the <HI>Trauelles of Sir Anthonie Sherley</HI> Knight, by Sea, and ouer Land, to the Per&s;ian Empire.</HEAD>
<P>_IT hath b&eacute;ene, and yet is, a pro|uerbiall &s;p&eacute;ech among&s;t vs, that
<HI>Trauellers may lie by authority;</HI> Now, whether this Prouerbe hath had authoritie, from that authority, which &s;ome Trauel|lers haue v&s;urped (neuer by iu|&s;tice granted) to lie; or whether their report (albeit mo&s;t true) yet exc&eacute;eding the beliefe of tho&s;e auditors that wil bel&eacute;eue nothing that falles not within their owne ocular experi|ence, or probabilitie of truth, &s;quared by the &s;ame: whe|ther (I &s;ay) from one, or both of the&s;e grounds, this pro|uerb hath &s;prung, I am vncertaine: but certaine I am, diuer&s;e there are (entiteling them&s;elues Trauellers, for cro&s;&s;ing the narrow &s;eas, to the neighbour partes of Pi|cardie peraduenture, or the lowe countries perhappes) from thence take authoritie to vtter lies in England (at their returne) by retaile, which they haue coyned there in gro&s;&s;e. And as &s;ure I am, that many hone&s;t and true Trauellers, for &s;peaking the truth, of their owne know|ledge (for in the world are many incomprehen&s;ible mi|racles
<PB N="2" REF="5">of Nature) yet becau&s;e it exc&eacute;eds the beliefe of the vnexperienced, &amp; home-bred vulgars, they are, by them, concluded liers for their labour. How could a man, from his birth confined in a dungeon or lightle&s;&s;e Caue, be brought to conceiue, or bel&eacute;eue the glorie and great mag|nificence of the vi&s;ible, cele&s;tiall, and terre&s;triall globes, with the wonderfull workes of the great Author of Na|ture in the &s;ame? Nay, were &s;uch a one &s;odainely tran&s;|ferred to the toppe of &s;ome mountaine or lofty Turret in a &s;ommers day, from whence he might beholde the glory of the heauens, repleni&s;hed with that mo&s;t admirable Cre&s;&s;et, who for his glittring and diuine glory, prouokes many nations of the world to performe diuine adoration therevnto. To &s;&eacute;e (I &s;ay) tho&s;e re&s;plendant and cri&s;tal|line heauens ouer-cannoping the earth, inue&s;ted mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly in height of Natures pride with her riche&s;t liuery; the particularities whereof, were they de&s;cribed according to the trueth of their nature, it might br&eacute;ede a &s;cruple in the naturall man, whether Man were (for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion) euer vnimparadized or no. And &s;uch a man, of whome I &s;peake, woulde (like a &s;oule &s;odainely tran&s;ferred, by the handes of Angells, from earth to hea|uen) be beheauened with the ioy he would conceiue, by rea&s;on of &s;o glorious a pro&s;pect, and &s;uch &s;oule-raui&s;hing and &s;en&s;e-bewitching obiectes. The application h&eacute;ereof is apparant: for were men m&eacute;erely home-bred (and in that re&s;pect but as the man confined to his Caue) abroad in the eminent and oppulent places of the world, as al&s;o in the mo&s;t remote and ob&s;cure corners of the &s;ame, and there with in&s;earching and well di&s;cerning eies, to be|hold the rarieties (&s;urmounting admiration) therein in|cluded, he would (no doubt) be rapt vp with cea&s;ele&s;&s;e wonderment, or wondrous amazement at the &s;ight and con&s;ideration of them. For mine owne part, I am re&s;ol|ued to make a true relation of what mine eies &s;aw, not
<PB N="3" REF="5">re&s;pecting the iudgement of the vulgars, but contenting my &s;elfe with the con&s;cience of the truth; be&s;ides which, (I prote&s;t) I purpo&s;e to write nothing. This by way of preamble: now to the matter.</P>
<P>Therefore, fir&s;t landing at <HI>Vli&s;hing,</HI> we were honou|rably receiued and entertained, of &s;ir <HI>Robert Sidney,</HI> lord Gouernour of that garri&s;on: from whence we went on foote to
<HI>Middleborough,</HI> where we tooke a &s;mall hoy that caried vs that night to
<HI>Sierichzee.</HI> From whence we then tooke our iourney to <HI>Somerdicke:</HI> From whence wee likewi&s;e cro&s;&s;t the water the next morning, and at night we lay at <HI>Brill.</HI> Hitherto we pa&s;&s;ed on foote, hiering poore &s;ouldiers to carry our baggage, by rea&s;on that the fro&s;t was &s;o great, that hor&s;es were not able to pa&s;&s;e, and the way vnu&s;uall. From the
<HI>Brill</HI> the next day we cro&s;&s;t the water; and landing, we had waggons that conueyed vs and ours to the <HI>Hage:</HI> where, no &s;ooner being alighted, but that &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> (attended by vs) went to vi&s;ite his Excellency, con&s;ociated with ma&s;ter <HI>Gilpin</HI> the Qu&eacute;ens Agent thither, where continuing not pa&s;t an houre to complement with the Prince, he withdrew him&s;elfe to his lodging to repo&s;e him&s;elfe: whither (not long after) his Excellencie and the States &s;ent fiftie great flaggons of wine, togither with his Pa&s;&s;e through his Countrey, whereby he was to take conuoy as he thought requi&s;ite. The next day to <HI>Leiden,</HI> &s;o to <HI>Vtricke,</HI> to <HI>Dewborough,</HI> and then to <HI>Collen,</HI> the pa&s;&s;age wherevnto was &s;ome|what da~gerous; by occa&s;ion wherof we had &s;ir <HI>Nicholas Parkers</HI> troupe of hor&s;e to conuoy vs thither; our compa|ny hauing <HI>25.</HI> of his hor&s;es to ride on, &amp; <HI>25.</HI> more of his troup, be&s;ides the cornetbearer to accompany vs to
<HI>Col|len,</HI> which we did in <HI>6.</HI> daies, &s;pending one night merily.</P>
<P>The next morning, &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> giuing the troupe that were his conuoy a bountifull rewarde, &s;ent them
<PB N="4" REF="6">backe againe; w&eacute;e taking our iourney forewardes tho|rowe tho&s;e partes of
<HI>Germanie,</HI> as <HI>Frankeford, Norem|bege,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> altogether by coach. From whence wee hired hor&s;es to pa&s;&s;e the <HI>Alpes,</HI> in re&s;pect that it was not pa&s;&s;able by coach. And from thence we were tenne dayes pa&s;&s;ing to <HI>Venice,</HI> whither we went, with re&s;olution to aide the duke of <HI>Ferrara</HI> in his warres again&s;t the Pope; who (good duke) fearing the Popes cur&s;e, gaue ouer the warres, as the Pope would: how|beit we remained in <HI>Venice</HI> tenne w&eacute;ekes. In which time, &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> went to the Duke thereof, who enter|tained him with all princely complement, &s;ending him to his lodging, a roy all banquet of all kinde of confected &s;w&eacute;ete meates, and wine in great aboundaunce; which continued a long time. Who likewi&s;e commaunded that we &s;hould haue libertie to &s;&eacute;e any thing in the cittie wor|thy the &s;ight, which accordingly we &s;aw, to &s;ir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> no &s;mall co&s;t; for in his rewards, he was there, and el&s;e|where, mo&s;t royall.</P>
<P>To write of the fa&s;hions and di&s;po&s;itions of the <HI>Ger|mans</HI> and <HI>Italians,</HI> were a matter not woorth my paines, becau&s;e it is &s;o well knowne to all men, that knowes, or haue read, or heard any thing: therefore I will goe for|ward with our iourney, and write of matter more no|uellous, and le&s;&s;e knowne to my home-bred countrey|men, for who&s;e &s;ake (chiefly) I haue compiled this Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In Maie next folowing our departure from England, we &s;et forwards from <HI>Venice,</HI> in an Italian &s;hip, which we had compounded with, among&s;t others, to conuey vs to <HI>Aleppo;</HI> but by occa&s;ion of &s;ome iarres w&eacute;e hadde with &s;ome Italians (pa&s;&s;engers as w&eacute;e were) in the &s;hip, they landed vs in an Iland of the <HI>Venetians</HI> called
<HI>Zanc,</HI> vnto which place w&eacute;e were two and twenty dayes pa&s;|&s;ing: the captaine a&s;&s;uring vs, that we &s;houlde haue
<PB N="5" REF="6">pa&s;&s;ed it in tenne dayes, which made vs prouide but for aft&eacute;ene dayes vittaile; tho&s;e fift&eacute;ene dayes being expi|red, our vittaile quite &s;pent, and hauing &s;eauen dayes trauell further in that &s;hip, we could for money, nor by no meanes get any vittailes of tho&s;e vnkinde Italians, whereby we had bin very gr&eacute;euou&s;ly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but that certaine Per&s;ians (though Pagans by profe&s;&s;ion) being in the &s;hip well vittailed, and &s;&eacute;eing the impious and dogged di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e Italians, &s;upplied all our wants for that &s;eauen dayes <HI>gratis.</HI> In which time, an Italian in that &s;hippe, v&s;ing &s;ome villainous and oppro|brious &s;peaches towardes our Queenes Maie&s;tie, and the &s;ame not heard of by &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> nor any of his company in two dayes after, but then made knowne by an Italian that attended mai&s;ter <HI>Robert Sherly:</HI> where|of when &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> heard, he forthwith cau&s;ed one of our company &s;o to heate him with a billet, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould euer recouer it. In the performaunce whereof, he made a great outcry, wherevpon all the I|talians were vp in armes, being in number &s;ome thr&eacute;e &s;core per&s;ons, and we but foure and twenty. Howbeit, we were (with weapons drawne) pre&s;t to defend and offend. The captaine of the &s;hip thereupon demanded of &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> how any man dur&s;t intermeddle, in that kinde, vnder his commaund? Wherevnto &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> replied, that it was an iniurie, tending to the reproach and indignitie of his Soueraigne, which hee neither would nor could indure; and therewithall told him, if he would &s;ubborne or abet him therein, the one &s;ide &s;hould welter in their blood. And our &s;ide being rather de&s;irous to pro&s;ecute this point with &s;wordes, then with wordes. Sir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> brother gaue the captaine a &s;ound boxe, which was very hardely dige&s;ted, and much mi&s;chiefe had like to haue fallen thereon; but by meanes of cer|taine Merchants in the &s;hip, more feareful of their goods
<PB N="6" REF="7">then of the lo&s;&s;e of their bloods (and yet fearefull enough of either) pacified (with much adoe) both parties, How|beit either part liued watching and warding vntill they put vs on &s;hore, on the &s;aid Iland of <HI>Zant:</HI> where they left vs hopele&s;&s;e (God wot) of going forwards or backe|wards. There we continued ten dayes, in which time we hired a Gr&eacute;eki&s;h &s;hip, being an open boate, and very olde, and full of dangerous leakes; yea &s;o dangerous were the leakes, that in eleuen daies (in which time w&eacute;e pa&s;&s;ed from
<HI>Zant</HI> to <HI>Candia</HI>) continually during all that time foure men had as much toile as po&s;&s;ibly they could indure, to laue water out of this rotten boate: which was &s;o weake, that if euen then wee hadde hadde but euer &s;o little rough weather, there had all our hopes, to|gether with our carca&s;&s;es, peri&s;hed, and we neuer haue arriued at <HI>Candia.</HI> Where we made our abode &s;ome twelue dayes, vntill our boate was repaired, and made fitter to brooke the &s;eas. In which time, the Gouernor of that Ile (being a Duke vnder the Venetians) &s;ent for &s;ir
<HI>Anthony</HI> to his Pallace to dinner, who al&s;o &s;ent to his lodging, a very great and co&s;tly banquet, and like|wi&s;e permitted vs (in great fauour) to pa&s;&s;e round about the towne, to &s;&eacute;e the &s;trength thereof; which was rea&s;o|nable well fortified with ordonance and other adiuncts of warre, e&s;pecially on that &s;ide that lay towards the &s;ea: the other partes not &s;o &s;trong, for the ditch about the Towne was drie. The Inhabitants of that towne and I&s;le are (for the mo&s;t part) Gr&eacute;ekes, who&s;e maners and behauiors doe verifie our Engli&s;h prouerb, which term|eth any man, plea&s;antly di&s;po&s;ed (by rea&s;on of wine, or otherwi&s;e) a merry Gr&eacute;eke; alluding to the&s;e Gr&eacute;ekes, that alwayes &s;it drinking and playing the good fellowes before their doores: &s;ome dauncing arme in arme vp and downe the towne: Some others making &s;ome other &s;ports, to procure laughter; and thus game&s;omely doe
<PB N="7" REF="7">they pa&s;&s;e their time, as if they were created but for the matter of plea&s;ure: So that to me it &s;&eacute;emed no litle won|der, that that Nation, which heretofore made all the world admire their wi&s;edome and learning, who (in regarde of them&s;elues) held all the worlde be&s;ides, but Barbarians or harbarous, &s;hould now become &s;uch cup &s;hot companions, tripping their nimble wittes with quicke and &s;ubtile wine, thereby turning all their d&eacute;epe pollicie, into d&eacute;epe carow&s;ing, and &s;hallow iocunditie. But, <HI>Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis.</HI> Hauing &s;pent tho&s;e twelue dayes, as afore&s;aide, in
<HI>Candia,</HI> a|mong tho&s;e merry Gr&eacute;ekes, we eft&s;oones imbarked our &s;elues for
<HI>Ciprus,</HI> to which we were &s;ome nine dayes pa&s;&s;ing: where (as the &s;aying is) the Italians (with whome we pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Zant</HI>) did our errand (like knights errand) again&s;t our comming. They made reporte to the Turkes inhabiting the &s;ame Ile, that we were all pirats, and that they &s;hould do wel to lay hands on vs, &amp; to carry vs to the great Turk their emperor, becau&s;e, be&s;ides that, we were pirats, &amp; came into <HI>Turky,</HI> but as &s;pies. Wherevpon the Turkes laid handes vpon vs, e|uen vpon our fir&s;t arriuall, threatning to haue brought vs to <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> howbeit they &s;taird vs in <HI>Ciprus</HI> two daies; in which time, they were indifferently well qualified, in hope of mony we promi&s;ed them, and which they had, to their full contentment, ere we parted from them.</P>
<P>This was the wor&s;t welcome which we receiued on &s;hoare &s;ince our departure from the Engli&s;h &s;hore, and made vs mo&s;t to doubt our &s;afety. But within two dayes pa&s;&s;age of
<HI>Candia,</HI> as we came towardes <HI>Ciprus</HI> (which I had almo&s;t omitted) there is al&s;o a Gr&eacute;eki&s;h I&s;le (who&s;e name (I am a&s;hamed therfore) I haue quite forgotten) wherevpon we touched and watered, which is &s;ome half mile ouer, hauing one religious hou&s;e ther|in
<PB N="8" REF="8">and alone, with about &s;ome twenty Gr&eacute;eke friggets inhabiting the &s;ame, which is (as w&eacute;e thought) an other <HI>Eden;</HI> and the mo&s;t plea&s;ant place that euer our eies behelde, for the exerci&s;e of a &s;olitary and contem|platiue life: for it is furni&s;hed with the foizen of all Gods good ble&s;&s;ings. All kinde of fruites (as apples, peares, plumbes, orenges, lemmonds, pomegranates, and the like) in great aboundaunce groweth there: with mo&s;t plea&s;ant gardens, repleni&s;hed with all man|ner of odoriferous floures, and whole&s;ome hearbes for &s;allets, or medicines: wherein breaketh foorth many fre&s;h and cri&s;tall cl&eacute;ere Springs of water: hauing therewithall, cattell&punc; (as beeues and muttons there na|turally bred) more than &s;ufficient to &s;erue that hou&s;e. In our trauelles many times, falling into daungers, and vnplea&s;ant places, this onely I&s;land would be the place where we woulde wi&s;h our &s;elues to end our liues. They haue al&s;o this helpe, that if they did want aught, &s;hipping continually pa&s;&s;ing by that way, would &s;oone &s;upply it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ciprus</HI> (as from a place we had &s;mall rea&s;on to take plea&s;ure in, our entertainement was &s;o vn|plea&s;aunt) wee hired a very &s;mall boate of &s;ome ten tunne (there being none other to hire) to tran&s;porte vs vnto the Holy Land, the which was but foure and twenty houres &s;ailing. But the Turkes (our Taxers) tolde vs, that there lay Gallies fraught with Th&eacute;eues that robbed all that pa&s;&s;ed that way: notwith&s;tanding, we hoi&s;ed vp &s;aile, and put our &s;elues to Sea thither|ward, abandoning our &s;elues to all the rouing aduen|tures of Fortune, being accompanied with an other boate which helde her direct cour&s;e whither we were bound, which was taken (as afterward app&eacute;ered) and her men drowned. But, as God woulde haue it, (to whome, as well for that, as all our other many many
<PB N="9" REF="8">pre&s;eruations, beyond all probabilitie and expectation, we were infinitely bound) our boate, by the way, being taken by an indirect winde, to that our direct cour&s;e, we thereby fell downe vpon <HI>Tripoly.</HI> Who being guided by an omnipotent and neuer-failing Pilote, we pa&s;&s;ed out of the &s;ea into that famous riuer <HI>Orontes;</HI> along the which we held our cour&s;e vp into the countrie, the Iani|zaries or &s;ouldiers thereof flocking about vs, threatning, that if they might not haue what they demaunded, they would cul out &s;uch of our company as be&s;t plea&s;ed them to &s;erue their zodomiticall appetites, and mo&s;t vile and villainous purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>This while we &s;ent to <HI>Antioch,</HI> not thr&eacute;e dayes iour|ney off, for certaine Ianizaries, to &s;afeconduct vs thi|ther, which Ianizaries were of our Interpreters ac|quaintance, who being come, the other left vs immedi|ately, and &s;o we pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>Antioch,</HI> conducted by the Ia|nizaries which we &s;ent for thither, where we remained &s;ixe or &s;eauen dayes, for the company of certaine Mer|chants that were bound to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> b&eacute;eing &s;ix dayes ior|ney from <HI>Antioch,</HI> betw&eacute;ene which Cities, in the way, were from time to time, diuers robberies committed by &s;ome two hundred Arabs, vntill that in&s;tant that wee were at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where we heard, that the Ianizaries of <HI>Aleppo</HI> i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t the&s;e robbers, part of whom they killed, and the re&s;t put to flight, by meanes where|of, our pa&s;&s;age was cl&eacute;ered to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> whither we were bound, and where we were right well entertained, by the Engli&s;h Con&s;ulles, and the re&s;t of the Engli&s;h mer|chants. There we remayned about &s;ome &s;ixe w&eacute;ekes at the Engli&s;h hou&s;es, and fea&s;ted (for the mo&s;t parte) while w&eacute;e there continued. And being examined by the
<HI>Ba&s;haw</HI> of that place, touching our intendement, &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> aun&s;wered, that wee were Merchants, de|&s;irous to trade to the vtmo&s;t confines of his countries;
<PB N="10" REF="9">which was graunted by the <HI>Ba&s;haw,</HI> with his Pa&s;&s;e, to|gether with the Engli&s;h Con&s;ulls and vice-con&s;ulls.</P>
<P>Leauing h&eacute;ere awhile to pro&s;ecute our iorney, I will &s;peake &s;omewhat of the fa&s;hion and di&s;po&s;ition of the people and country; who&s;e behauiours in point of ciuili|tie (be&s;ides that they are damned Infidells, and Zodo|miticall Mahomets) doe an&s;wer the hate we chri&s;tians doe iu&s;tly holde them in. For they are beyond all mea|&s;ure a mo&s;t in&s;olent &s;uperbous and in&s;ulting people, euer more pre&s;t to offer outrage to any chri&s;tian, if he be not well guarded with a Ianizarie, or Ianizaries. They &s;it at their meat (which is &s;erued to them vpon the ground) as Tailers &s;it vpon their &s;talls, cro&s;&s;e-legd: for the mo&s;t part, pa&s;&s;ing the day in banqueting and carow&s;ing, vn|till they &s;urfet, drinking a certaine liquor which they do call <HI>Coffe,</HI> which is made of a &s;&eacute;de much like mu&s;tard &s;&eacute;ede, which wil &s;oone intoxicate the braine, like our Me|theglin. They will not permitte any chri&s;tian to come within their churches, for they holde their profane and irreligious Sanctuaries defiled thereby. They haue no v&s;e of Belles, but &s;ome prie&s;t thr&eacute;e times in the day, mounts the toppe of their church, and there, with an ex|alted voyce cries out, and inuocates Mahomet to come in po&s;t, for they haue long expected his &s;econd comming. And if within this &s;ixe y&eacute;eres (as they &s;ay) he come not (being the vtmo&s;t time of his appoyntment and pro|mi&s;e made in that behalfe) they haue no hope of his com|ming. But they feare (according to a prophecie they haue) the Chri&s;tians at the end therof &s;hal &s;ubdue them all, and conuert them to chri&s;tianitie. They haue wiues in number according to their wealth, two, thr&eacute;e, foure, or vpwards, according as they are in abilitie turni&s;hed to maintaine them. Their women are (for the mo&s;t part) very faire, barbed euery where; and death it is for anie chri&s;tian carnally to know them; which, were they wil|ling
<PB N="11" REF="9">to doe, hardly could they attaine it, becau&s;e they are clo&s;ely chambred vp, vnle&s;&s;e it be at &s;uch time as they go to their <HI>Ba&s;toues,</HI> or to the Graues, to bewaile their dead (as their maner is) which once a w&eacute;eke v&s;ually they doo, and then &s;hall no part of them be di&s;couered neither, but onely their eies, except it be by a great chaunce. The country aboundeth with great &s;tore of all kinds of fruit, whereupon (for the mo&s;t parte) they liue, their ch&eacute;efe&s;t meate being Rice. Their fle&s;h is Mutton and Hennes; which Muttons haue huge broade fatte tailes. This meate mo&s;t commonly they haue but once in the day, all the re&s;t, they eate fruite as afore&s;aide. They eate very little b&eacute;efe, vnle&s;&s;e it be the poore&s;t &s;ort. Camels for their carriage they haue in great abundance; but when both them and their hor&s;es are pa&s;t the be&s;t, and vnfit for car|riage, the poore&s;t of their people eate them.</P>
<P>They haue one thing mo&s;t v&s;ual among them, which though it be right wel knowne to all of our Nation that knowe <HI>Turkie,</HI> yet it exc&eacute;edeth the credite of our home-bred countriemen, for relating whereof (perhappes) I may be held a liar, hauing authoritie &s;o to doe (as they &s;ay and thinke) becau&s;e I am a traueller. But the truth thereof (being knowne to al our Engli&s;hmen that trade or trauel into tho&s;e partes) is a warrant omni&s;ufficient for the report, how repugnant &s;oeuer it be to the bel&eacute;efe of our Engli&s;h multitude.</P>
<P>And this it is, when they de&s;ire to heare news, or in|telligence out of any remote parts of their country with all celeritie (as we &s;ay, vppon the wings of the winde) they haue pigeons that are &s;o taught and brought to the hand, that they will flie with Letters (fa&s;tened with a &s;tring about their bodies vnder their wings) containing all the intelligence of occurrents, or what el&s;e is to be ex|pected from tho&s;e partes: from whence, if they &s;houlde &s;end by camells (for &s;o otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t) they &s;hould
<PB N="12" REF="10">not heare in a quarter of a y&eacute;ere, for &s;o long would they be in continuall trauel. As for example; when any mer|chandize are to come out of the ea&s;t

<HI>Mecha</HI> or <HI>Aleppo</HI> before hand, which is a quarter of a y&eacute;eres pa&s;&s;age, then they tie (as before is mentioned) the &s;aid letters about the pigeons, acquainting therby their factors what commodities they haue, and what are like to prooue mo&s;t vendible: by meanes whereof (whiles their camels are thr&eacute;e noneths in comming) they know what merchandize is fit to be kept, and what to doe a|way.</P>
<P>Now to returne where I left, and &s;o to goe forward with our iourney: w&eacute;e pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Aleppo</HI> through the heart of the Turkes country, the &s;trength whereof is very &s;mall, whereof the chri&s;tian Princes are ignorant, (as it &s;&eacute;ems) for if they knew it, as we do, that with al cir+cum&s;pection ob&s;erued it; doubtle&s;&s;e, they would with no great difficultie vtterly &s;uppre&s;&s;e him, or &s;o extreamely di&s;tre&s;&s;e him, that they would con&s;train him to embrace the chri&s;tian faith, and re&s;t at their deuotion, or at lea&s;t remoue his &s;eate from the holy land, and parts adiacent.

So iclous are hu&s;bands of their wiues loues and cha&s;tities, and &s;uch cau&s;e of &s;u&s;pition is there among&s;t them in that re&s;pect. There is a cu&s;tome in that country, that if the King pur|po&s;e to make any man great, by enoblizing him, he hath a very rich chaire &s;ette with &s;tones carried after him, wherein he placeth that man at his banquet in publike a&s;&s;embly. This chaire was brought for &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> to &s;it in, and he by the King placed therein accordingly. Which made the people much to admire that accident, in that hee vouch&s;afed that high fauour to a &s;tranger, without de&s;ert, or experience of his w&oacute;rth: whereas ac|cu&s;tomably he would haue great proofe of a mans wor|thine&s;&s;e, before he would &s;o vouch&s;afe to dignifie him. In&s;tantly as he cau&s;ed &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> to &s;it, he gaue him his owne girdle from about him for a further fauour: which was all of &s;ome golden &s;tuffe, very curious and co&s;tly, thr&eacute;e yards long, and an ell broade.</P>

<P>And albeit the fa&s;hion and mauer of the Per&s;ians is not vnknowne to many of our Engli&s;h nation, as ha|uing, by their owne trauells, attained that knowledge: or by reading, or credible report bin informed thereof: Yet &s;omewhat to &s;peake touching the &s;ame, I hold it not altogether ami&s;&s;e, for the better information of tho&s;e (my countrymen) that doe not &s;o well know it. For their &s;itting at meate on the ground, with their manner of foode and f&eacute;eding, it is much after the Turki&s;h gui&s;e. Their deuotion as the Turkes, but &s;omwhat different in religion. As the Per&s;ian praieth only to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and <HI>Mortus Ally,</HI> the Turke to tho&s;e two, and to three other that were <HI>Mahomets</HI> &s;eruants. Again&s;t which three, the Per&s;ian &s;til inueighs, and hath in al townes, men that carry axes on their &s;houlders, challenging them to ri&s;e againe, and they are there pre&s;t to incoun|ter them by force of armes.</P>
<P>They v&s;e much exerci&s;e, as hawking and hunting, with very much &s;hooting. Their hawkes are excellent good, which they beare on their right hand, without hood or bell.</P>
<P>The merchandize and commodities which <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="16">y&eacute;eldeth, are &s;ilkes, both rawe, and otherwi&s;e, of all &s;utes and colours. Spices, drugges, pearles, and other pretious Iems: together with carpets of diuers kinds. The&s;e, with many other commodities of this nature, <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> plentifully affoordeth.</P>
<P>They write from the right &s;ide of the paper to the left like the Turkes, contrary to our manner. Their Let|ters or Characters being &s;o irregular, and (as we would thinke) deformed, that to vs it &s;&eacute;emeth the writing of &s;ome vtterly vn&s;kilfull in letters or learning, or as a wilde kind of &s;cribling, that hath therein neither forme nor matter: howbeit they affirm their writing is mo&s;t compendious, and euery letter (well n&eacute;ere) with his circumfler importeth a whole word, though con&s;i&s;ting of many &s;illables.</P>
<P>They haue not many Bookes, much le&s;&s;e great Li|braries among&s;t their be&s;t Clarkes. They are no lear|ned nation, but ignorant in all kinde of liberall or lear|ned Sciences, and almo&s;t of all other Arts and Facul|ties, except it be in certaine things pertaining to hor|&s;es furniture, and &s;ome kindes of carpettings and &s;ilke workes, wherein they excell.</P>
<P>They haue neither golde nor &s;iluer from any mines of their owne, for they haue none: howbeit they haue money made of both kindes, in great plenty, together with &s;ome &s;mall coyne made of copper, like our <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> tokens.</P>
<P>Theyr conceit of Chri&s;t is, that h&eacute;e was a very great Prophet, and a mo&s;t holy and religious man, but no way comparable to <HI>Mahomet:</HI> for <HI>Mahomet</HI> (&s;ay they) was that finall prophet, by whom all things were, and are to be perfected and con&s;ummated. They further &s;ay, that becau&s;e God had neuer wife, therefore Chri&s;t can|not po&s;&s;ibly be his &s;onne.</P>
<P>If any man con&s;pire trea&s;on again&s;t the king, or o|therwi&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="16">capitally offend him, h&eacute;e is puni&s;hed, not onely in his owne per&s;on, but in his whole Tribe.</P>
<P>If they affirme any matter with an othe, they &s;wear by God and <HI>Mahomet,</HI> or <HI>Mortus Ally:</HI> and when they would be bel&eacute;eued, they &s;weare by all thr&eacute;e at once.</P>
<P>They circumci&s;e their children at &s;eauen y&eacute;eres olde, according to the cu&s;tome of their neighbour the Turks.</P>
<P>In making water, the men kowre downe like the women, and when they doe it, they haue a &s;powte or &s;pringer, to &s;pirt &s;ome parte of their water vppon their priuy partes, a&s;well men as women, which they holde as a kinde of religious duty, and which in no &s;ort mu&s;t be neglected.</P>
<P>They buy and &s;ell men and women in the market, which is a principal merchandi&s;e of theirs among them &s;elues. If they buy any yoong women there, they f&eacute;ele them euery where. If a man buy a bond-woman for his owne carnalitie, and &s;he prooue fal&s;e to him, h&eacute;e may (by their lawe) kill her, as he may a dog in Eng|land.</P>
<P>In praying, they turne their faces towardes the South, as wee doe towardes the Ea&s;t, becau&s;e
<HI>Mecha</HI> where <HI>Mahomet</HI> is encoffined in yron (which by force of a Temples roofe, con&s;i&s;ting of Adamant, hangeth, as it were, by way of myracle in the ayre) lieth in
<HI>Arabia,</HI> which is South from them. To which, who&s;oeuer &s;hall go on pilgrimage (as many of them doe) they are euer held for mo&s;t holy and &s;acred Saintes, which they call
<HI>Setes,</HI> and not onely them&s;elues are &s;o reputed, but the po&s;teritie of that man are &s;o accounted, and of them|&s;elues are &s;o per&s;waded. For if one &s;hall in any thing contradict them, either in &s;aying or in dooing, they will ouer-rule him, and exact credit and bel&eacute;efe with all obe|dience, by &s;aying he is a Saint at lea&s;t, and therefore, on paine of damnation, mu&s;t be bel&eacute;eued, and highly e|&s;t&eacute;emed

<P>Their buildings are (for the mo&s;t parte) made of bricke, hardned in the &s;and, not made with fire, as durs are: wherein they haue very little furniture other then carpets vpon their floores; and &s;uch the poore&s;t man hath, but the goodnes thereof is according to the abilitie of the owners: their hou&s;es are all made with flatte roofes without, couered with a kinde of plai&s;ter, or earth &s;pred plai&s;terwi&s;e.</P>

<P>The people are now very curteous, v&s;ing all &s;tran|gers with great kindne&s;&s;e and ciuilitie, e&s;pecially &s;ince this King hath gouerned. Howbeit (by report) they haue b&eacute;ene heretofore little better (in that re&s;pect) then the Turks.</P>

<PB N="27" REF="17">pa&s;t, for that he hath drawne all the fore-mentioned townes and parts into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: which, when his Predece&s;&s;ors would inuade the Turke before, the&s;e would impeach and molle&s;t them behinde: &s;o that now he &s;tands &s;ecure from all inua&s;ion of the borderers, whereby he is able to carry all his force cl&eacute;ere, without interruption again&s;t the Turke, which at the lea&s;t will be foure hundred thou&s;and &s;trong. Vpon which vnder|taking he is (as before was mentioned) fully re&s;olued: but fir&s;t by &s;ir
<HI>Anthonies</HI> aduice, he is determined to ioyne in league, amitie, and confederacie with the Chri&s;tian princes, by meanes whereof, he may the &s;oo|ner preuaile in his purpo&s;e, and thereby vtterly &s;up|pre&s;&s;e the Turke. Howbeit his councellers were all ob|&s;tinately bent again&s;t the&s;e determinations and pro|c&eacute;edings at the fir&s;t, yet the king with his generall, who is a <HI>Georgian</HI> Chri&s;tian (&s;till animated and prouoked therevnto by &s;ir

And by that mutuall con&s;ent of the king and his coun&s;ell, no man was thought &s;o &s;it to be imployed in Emba&s;&s;ie to the chri&s;tian princes (to the purpo&s;e aboue recited) as &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> b&eacute;eing a Chri&s;tian, and the fir&s;t mouer of the king to the&s;e vndertakings, appointing a great man of the Per&s;ians to accompany him in tho&s;e bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, but the whole burden thereof to lie onely vp|on &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> who vndertooke the &s;ame accordingly|ly.</P>
<P>Which b&eacute;eing concluded, and thus vndertaken, w&eacute;e were ready to departe from the Kings court, lying then at <HI>Ha&s;phane,</HI> when &s;uddainly there came newes of a Portingall fryer, that was comming thither, ac|companied with two other fryers, and foure &s;eruants: this fryer &s;tayed &s;ome thr&eacute;e miles off the towne, and
<PB N="28" REF="18">&s;ent the other two with letters to &s;ir <HI>Anthony;</HI> whereby he &s;ignified vnto him that he was the la&s;t King of Por|tingales brother, and that hee was &s;ent by the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> as Procurator generall of al the Ea&s;t Indies. Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> bel&eacute;euing it, went him&s;elfe, accompanied with as many chri&s;tians as he could get, to the Frigot. And after mutuall gr&eacute;etings, h&eacute;e tolde &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> that hearing of his great and weighty bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, and &s;o godly a worke (he being a great bi&s;hoppe of the king of <HI>Spaines</HI>) came po&s;ting night and day to a&s;&s;i&s;t him there|in. Which &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> was right glad of, and to ma|nife&s;t the &s;ame the better, h&eacute;e brought him along to his owne hou&s;e, and there di&s;lodged his brother to lodge him.</P>
<P>This being doone, h&eacute;e tolde &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> that h&eacute;e greatly de&s;ired to &s;&eacute;e the King, for that h&eacute;e had a pre&s;ent to be&s;tow on him, which &s;ir
<HI>Anthony</HI> &s;oone procured. But now, by the way, this pre&s;ent was deliuered him in tru&s;t, to be deliuered to the king, howbeit h&eacute;e pre&s;en|ted it in his owne name, in requitall whereof the King gaue him a Crucifixe woorth (by e&s;timation) a hundred pounds and better: which villany, and many others, &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> afterwards di&s;couered, though the meane while he held him for a holy man.</P>
<P>Ere we departed from the King, he would faine (by the Kings Commi&s;&s;ion) haue bin an Agent in the pre|&s;ent action, wherein &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> was principally em|ployed, and likely he was to haue bin one, with vni|uer&s;all con&s;ent, but that the writings &amp; all other things therevnto incident were before perfected and fini&s;hed. And &s;&eacute;eing he could be no actor (as h&eacute;e defired) by rea&s;on thereof, hee intreated &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> to procure the Kings fauourable letters, in his behalfe, to the Pope, and the King of <HI>Spaine;</HI> which &s;ir
<HI>Anthony</HI> did accordingly. In requitall whereof, he beganne (vnder-hand) to deale
<PB N="29" REF="18">with tho&s;e of the Kings councell, which had bin backe|wards in the beginning of the&s;e bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, who a&s;&s;ured them, that &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> was not able to performe &s;o great a negotiation. Which &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> perceiuing, h&eacute;e made all the ha&s;te he po&s;&s;ibly could to be gone, the rather, becau&s;e h&eacute;e had waded &s;omewhat too farre with this execrable frier, who the fir&s;t night he lodged in &s;ir <HI>Anthonies</HI> hou&s;e, found the meanes to haue a Per&s;ian curtezan to lie with him, and &s;o had night by night du|ring his continuannce there; which if he wanted, h&eacute;e would hyre a boy zodomitically to v&s;e. And that he was a zodomiticall wretch, it dooth appeare hereby: &s;ir <HI>An|thony</HI> at his fir&s;t comming, bought twoo chri&s;tian boies in the market, which afterwardes he be&s;towed on this Frier, who&s;e name was <HI>Nicolao deMelo.</HI> He no &s;ooner had them, but h&eacute;e was in hand with them concerning his zodomiticall villany. The boyes finding whereto h&eacute;e was inclined (beeing ince&s;&s;auntly importuned by him, to y&eacute;elde to his bea&s;tly de&s;ire, complained to him that &s;olde them, h&eacute;e likewi&s;e to the Officer, the Offi|cer to the King, by meanes whereof the King e&s;pied his villany.

<P>Soone after w&eacute;e departed, taking the Frier and one of his fellowes with vs, hauing eight&eacute;ene dayes iour|ney from the Per&s;ian Court to <HI>Iegland,</HI> where w&eacute;e were imbarked to cro&s;&s;e the Ca&s;pian &s;ea.

In which time w&eacute;e &s;ent to entreate, that eyther our Engli&s;h merchants might be permitted to come toovs, or that w&eacute;e might goe or &s;end to them for nece&s;&s;aries, becau&s;e we were not fitted wyth clothes, (as we thought) con|uenient for the Emperors pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Where vpon the Lord Chauncellor &s;ent for the mer|chants, enquyring of them what &s;ir
<HI>Anthony</HI> was, and whether they dur&s;t giue hym any credite. To whome they replyed, that h&eacute;e was nobly de&s;cended, and alied euen to the be&s;t men of <HI>England:</HI> yea, and that they woulde giue hym credite for as much as they were woorth.</P>
<P>Here vppon they had liberty to &s;end vs &s;uch nece&s;&s;a|ries as w&eacute;e &s;ent for, but no liberty to come to vs, much le&s;&s;e we to them.</P>
<P>The tenth day w&eacute;e were &s;ent for to come before the Emperor after theyr order, which was, to lay downe in a note, howe euery man &s;houlde bee mar&s;halled in comming (b&eacute;eing all on hor&s;ebacke) wherein the Per&s;ian Emba&s;&s;adour was appoynted by the Empe|rour to haue the fir&s;t and chiefe place, the next, that Per&s;ian that was &s;ent but to accompany &s;ir
<HI>Anthony,</HI> and the la&s;t of the thr&eacute;e &s;houlde be &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> hym|&s;efie.</P>
<P>Which when &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> perceyued, h&eacute;e vtterly
<PB N="34" REF="21">refu&s;ed to goe in that order, becau&s;e that he, to who&s;e tru&s;t and charge the whole bu&s;ine&s;&s;e had b&eacute;ene cemmit|ted, and by whome the &s;ame was &s;olely procured: by which <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> likewi&s;e &s;houlde be infinitely benefited (&s;pecially he being a chri&s;tian, and they Pagans) &s;hould be put hindermo&s;t in the march, that was the formo&s;t in the matter.</P>
<P>By the meanes of which refu&s;all, h&eacute;e purcha&s;ed the Emperours di&s;plea&s;ure: and to manife&s;t the &s;ame, fir&s;t h&eacute;e tooke the Frier from &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> and gaue him his libertie to goe whither h&eacute;e thought good. Next, h&eacute;e daily &s;ent his great Dukes to examine &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> vp|on diuers friuolous particularities, to prooue, if they thereby might groape out &s;ome matter of aduantage a|gain&s;t him.</P>
<P>Thus daily h&eacute;e was extreamely vexed and mole&s;ted by the Emperour, the Per&s;ian Emba&s;&s;adour, withall, &s;etting on the Frier vnder-hand, to deui&s;e all the villa|ny h&eacute;e could again&s;t him, as to &s;ay, h&eacute;e knew &s;ir <HI>An|thony</HI> to be but a man of meane parentage, and al&s;o, that hee was come but as a Spic through the Countrey for purpo&s;es tending to his owne good, and not of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> and Chri&s;tendome, as h&eacute;e pretended. Whereup|on they tooke all the kings Letters from him, and ope|ned them, to know the purport thereof.</P>
<P>Soone after &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> and the Frier were brought before the Commi&s;&s;ioners to be further examined: where &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> (b&eacute;eing inflamed with choler, by rea&s;on of his exc&eacute;eding ill v&s;age, notwith&s;tanding the goodne&s;&s;e of the cau&s;e of his comming) demaunded whether the Emperour did euer purpo&s;e to &s;end any Emba&s;&s;adours to any other Countries? Prote&s;ting, that if euer h&eacute;e mette with them in any partes of the world, be&s;ides theyr owne, h&eacute;e would indeuour to let
<PB N="35" REF="21">them knowe h&eacute;e was not halfe &s;o well intreated in <HI>Ru&s;cia,</HI> as the cau&s;e of his comming of right de&s;erued, and the Emperour, by the lawes diuine and ciuil ought to haue perfourmed, and the rather, becau&s;e h&eacute;e was a Chri&s;tian, &s;uch as h&eacute;e pretends him&s;elfe to be, and came (as became a chri&s;tian) for the generall good of al Chri&s;tendome, the Per&s;ian being &s;tirred vp therevnto by his onely meanes. Wherevpon the Frier in terms thwarted &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> who&s;e blood already boyled, with the exce&s;&s;e of his chollers heate, which as then a|bounded. And being by that gracele&s;&s;e and vngratefull Frier further prouoked, hee (not able, though in&s;tant|ly he &s;hould haue died for it) to &s;uppre&s;&s;e his heate, gaue the fatte Frier &s;uch a &s;ound box on the face (his double cau&s;e of choller redoubling his might, de&s;ire of reuenge withall augmenting the &s;ame) that downe falles the Frier, as if h&eacute;e had b&eacute;ene &s;trooke with a thunder-bolt. Which b&eacute;eing doone, (with that courage and high re|&s;olution which well app&eacute;ered in his lookes, wordes, and d&eacute;edes) they foorthwith gaue ouer examination, be|cau&s;e they had too far examined &s;ir <HI>Anthonies</HI> patience, which well they with feare (as I thinke) &s;awe, and the Frier (almo&s;t pa&s;t feare) did farre better f&eacute;ele. Where|vpon they went in&s;tantly to the Emperour, and infor|med him of all that had happened, and howe &s;ir
<HI>An|thony</HI> was re&s;olued. For which (as by the euent it ap|p&eacute;ered) h&eacute;e was v&s;ed the better. For from thence for|ward we had liberty to go to the Engli&s;hmen, of whom we were very honorably entertained, and royally fea|&s;ted. Howbeit w&eacute;e were con&s;trained to remaine there &s;ixe moneths, expecting euery day (for all this) &s;ome mi&s;chiefe to be doone vnto vs, or to be &s;ent into &s;ome parte of his country to be kept, where w&eacute;e &s;houlde not haue heard from our friendes in ha&s;te, which we feared
<PB N="36" REF="22">wor&s;e then death. Yet, in the end, w&eacute;e were eft&s;oones &s;ent for before the priuy councell, where &s;ir <HI>Anthony</HI> had his charge to be gone, which was no &s;mall ioy to vs all.</P>
<P>But the day before w&eacute;e left <HI>Mu&s;couia,</HI> it was my fortune to &s;&eacute;e the King, and his Qu&eacute;ene, in cerimonious and triumphant manner pa&s;&s;ing out of the Citty, with a great Image, and a huge Bell, to offer to a certayne Friery &s;ome thirty miles off, which was performed in this &s;orte. Fir&s;t, all the morning diuers troupes of hor&s;e pa&s;&s;ed out of the Citty, to &s;tand ready to receiue him at his comming out of the gate. About midday the King &s;etting forwards, his guard formo&s;t, all on hor&s;e|backe, to the number of fiue hundred, all clad in &s;tam|mel coats, riding in ranke, thr&eacute;e and three, with bows, and arrowes, and &s;words girt to them, as al&s;o hatchets vnder the one thigh. After the guarde were ledde, by twenty men, twenty goodly hor&s;es, with very rich and curious &s;addles, and ten more for his &s;onne and heire apparant, b&eacute;eing a childe of twelue yeeres of age. After which was ledde, in like &s;orte, twenty beutifull white hor&s;es, for the Qu&eacute;enes chariots, hauing onely vppon them a fine &s;heete, and on theyr heades a crime&s;in vel|uet bridle. After them came a great number of Friers in theyr rich coapes, &s;inging, carrying many pictures and lights. After them followed the greate&s;t parte of the merchants of the Citty. Next them was ledde the Kings hor&s;e, for that day, together with his &s;onnes: the kings &s;addle and furniture mo&s;t richly be&s;ette with &s;tones of great price and beauty. Then followed the Patriarch, wyth all the Archbi&s;hoppes, Bi&s;hoppes, and great Prelates &s;inging in their coapes, very rich and glorious, hauing huge Images borne before them, b&eacute;e|ing very richly inlayed, with pretious Iems of diuer&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="22">colours, and lights about them. Then followed the king him&s;elfe, who had in his left hand his &s;onne aboue mentioned, and in his right hand his cappe. Next him came the Qu&eacute;ene, &s;upported on eyther &s;ide by two olde Ladies, hir face euen thickely plai&s;tered with painting, as were the other Ladies (according to the cu&s;tome of the Countrey) hir body very gro&s;&s;e, hir eyes hollowe and far into hir head, attended with &s;ome thr&eacute;e &s;core very fayre women (if painting (which they holde a mat|ter religious) deceiued not the iudgement of mine eie.) All who&s;e apparel was very rich, be&s;et with pearle cu|riou&s;ly wrought, hauing white hattes on theyr heads, wyth great round bands laden wyth pearle. We ne|uer &s;awe hattes worne by any women in the Country, but by them onely. Next vnto them was drawne thr&eacute;e huge chariots, the fir&s;t with tenne fayre white hor&s;es, two and two, the &s;econd with eight, and the third with &s;ixe in like order: which chariots were al very rich and gorgeous within and without. After which, all the no|ble men pa&s;&s;ed in coaches. Then was caried, in a great che&s;t, the forenamed Image, guarded by a great man and State of the Country, with &s;ome fiue hundred vn|der his commaund, for the guarde and conuoy of that Image. And la&s;t of all came that huge bell, b&eacute;eing of twenty tunne weight, drawne by thr&eacute;e thou&s;and and fiue hundred men (not being po&s;&s;ible to be drawne by oxen or hor&s;es) in manner following. They fa&s;tned &s;ixe exc&eacute;eding long haw&s;ers, or mighty great gable ropes in &s;ix lengths to the frame whereon the bell was placed. In this ranke of ropes were placed tho&s;e thr&eacute;e thou&s;and and &s;ixe hundred men, with litle cordes ouer their &s;houlders, fa&s;tned to the great haw&s;ers, drawing after the manner of our We&s;terne barge-men h&eacute;ere in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="23"> The poy&s;e of the Bell was &s;o g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">at, that pa&s;&s;ing a|long the &s;tr&eacute;etes of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> (being paued wyth great &s;quare p&eacute;eces of timber &s;ette clo&s;e one by another) the woodde of the frame or carriage whereon the bell was drawne, &s;et the timber of the &s;tr&eacute;ets on fire, through both the woods cha&s;ing togither, &s;o that &s;ome were faine to followe hard after, to throwe on water, as the tim|bers beganne to &s;moake. And thus was this bell and the Image eonueyed to the Friery, as hath afore b&eacute;ene &s;ayde.</P>
<P>The next day following we tooke our iourney (that is to &s;ay, in mid Maie) towards Saint
<HI>Nicolas</HI> to take &s;hipping, which was &s;ome &s;ixe w&eacute;ekes pa&s;&s;age by land and riuer. During all which time, we &s;aw nothing, in a maner, but woods and water. But being come to the &s;ea &s;ide, being the place where w&eacute;e were to take &s;hip, we &s;tayed there one moneth for proui&s;ion for our iour|ney.</P>
<P>In which time we were diuers times inuited aboorde Engli&s;h &s;hippes, where we were roially banquetted at the Agents charges and the merchants. To the &s;olem|nization of which banquets we had thr&eacute;e hundred hun|dred great &s;hot. And as we &s;tayed there, one Mai&s;ter
<HI>Megricke</HI> a merchant came from <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> and brought the Friers two letters wyth hym, reporting that the Lord Chauncallor, in &s;ati&s;faction of the wrong and ill v&s;age he extended to &s;ir <HI>Anthony,</HI> &s;ent after the Frier to the borders, who tooke both his letters and all his &s;ub&s;tance that he had deceitfully and lewdly gotten in many yeares before in the <HI>Indiaes</HI> from him, leauing him not &s;o much as his Friers w&eacute;ede: and whether h&eacute;e cau&s;ed his throate to be cut, it was vncertayne, but not vnlike.</P>
<P>Thus, as this lewd wretch had (as peraduenture he
<PB N="39" REF="23">thought) pa&s;&s;ed the pikes of Gods iudgements bent a|gain&s;t him, and threatening his ruine, for his &s;euerall villanies, and that (as to him perhappes it &s;&eacute;emed) h&eacute;e was nowe euen entring the confines of his owne coun|trey, furni&s;hed with Letters in his commendation, from the Per&s;ian mighty Potentate, to his liege lord the king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> whereby h&eacute;e thought to haue attai|ned (notwith&s;tanding his former leud life in the <HI>Indies</HI>) great reputation and preferment, euen then was h&eacute;e ouertaken wyth a vengeance, and payed home with a mi&s;chiefe, to the vtter lo&s;&s;e of his Letters, wherein &s;o much h&eacute;e ioyed, his &s;ub&s;tance that was all his liue|loode, and (as it is mo&s;t likely) of his life, the leudne&s;&s;e whereof brought vppon him the&s;e vnexpected (yet well de&s;erued) mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>A good caueat for all tho&s;e, that vnder God almigh|ties coate, will play all diuelli&s;h prankes, whereof there are but too many (in the&s;e la&s;t dayes, and therefore the wor&s;t dayes) crept into his holy church, in all quarters of Chri&s;tendome, making the &s;ame &s;acred hou&s;e of pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">|er (which ought with all prayer and holy indeuor to b&eacute;e pre&s;erued from all pollution and polluted per&s;ons) a very denne of th&eacute;eues, as it is in the Go&s;pel, that walke continually in &s;h&eacute;epes clothing, but inwardely they are rauening Woolues: They are knowne by theyr workes.</P>
<P>From hence w&eacute;e tooke &s;hippe for <HI>Stoade,</HI> b&eacute;eing &s;ixe w&eacute;ekes vppon the Sea, ere w&eacute;e coulde recouer it. In which time we were continually to&s;&s;ed and tum|bled with contrary Windes: and once had b&eacute;ene like to haue b&eacute;ene vtterly ca&s;t away, &s;o that w&eacute;e all were o|uerwhelmed in de&s;payre, as w&eacute;e were at poynt to be in the Sea, but that (by Gods protection and direction) we (pa&s;t all expectation) fell vppon the Flie.
