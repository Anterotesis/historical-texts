<HEAD>JOYFULL NEWES FROM COBHAM-HALL IN KENT. Being a true Relation of &s;uch armes as were taken from thence Augu&s;t 20. ALSO A Di&s;covery of &s;uch Ammunition as was taken from the Arthbi&s;hop of Canterbury <HI>Aug. 19.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SVch hath beene the providence and vi|gilancie of this our Parliament, having been &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly &s;econded with the ble&s;sing of God up|on their endeavours that they have been &s;ucce&s;&s;efull even be|yond hope, in detecting and defeating the plots of the malignant party, how cunningly &s;oever by them contrived. Vpon the nineteenth of
<PB N="2" REF="3">this moneth the Parliament received informa|tion of about an hundred and twenty pieces of Ordnance that lay neere the water &s;ide foure miles from Grave&s;end, which cau&s;eth the in|habitants to watch them every night, fearing le&s;t tho&s;e which are ill-affected to the King and Parliament &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them&s;elves of them or &s;teale &s;ome of them away, many of them being &s;o &s;mall, that they might be carried away by two or three men, which might prove very preiudiciall to the peace of that countrey: whereupon the Parliament have taken order for the &s;ecuring and &s;afe keeping of them.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner is one pernicious de&s;igne di&s;co|vered, but another &s;upplies the roome of it: for information being given to the Parliament-Hou&s;e, that great &s;tore of armes and ammuni|tion was provided by that arch-ploiter of the&s;e evils, the Arch-bi&s;hop of Canterbury, and laid up in his hou&s;e at Lambeth, the &s;ame evening, being friday, about two hundred Foot, and a troop of Hor&s;e were &s;ent to &s;earch his hou&s;e, wherein they found armes for foure or five hundred men, all which they tooke away from his hou&s;e at Lambeth, and laid them in the Ci|ty having little need of &s;uch ammunition for his defence, being better provided in the Tower &s;ince hee kept Court there. Vpon the &s;ame evening a troupe of Hor&s;e were &s;ent into Kent to &s;earch &s;ome Recu&s;ants hou&s;es which were
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;u&s;pected to have great &s;tore of armes and am|munition, and coming to make &s;earch at Cob|ham-Hall, they were denied entrance, and very much re&s;i&s;ted, though little hurt was done, as is credibly reported, notwith&s;tanding the ru|mor of &s;o many being hurt and &s;laine: after much oppo&s;ition they entred the hou&s;e, and found there five cart loads of ammunition, which they have taken away, intending to bring it up to London. Vpon this day al&s;o Sir John Meldrom that was &s;ent to Hull, according to the de&s;ire of Sir John Hotham, by the Parlia|ment, for to aid and a&s;si&s;t him in the defence of that towne, came to the Parliament Hou&s;e, and acquainted them with the true &s;tate of of things there, and that Sir John Hotham hath &s;o cleared the coa&s;ts about him by &s;ea and land, that the Cavaliers dare not &s;o much as to come neer the towne. As for the maior part of York&s;hire, they are &s;o well affected to the Parliament, that when as His Maie&s;ty had commanded all his loving &s;ubiects to repaire unto him that would aid and a&s;si&s;t him, the chiefe&s;t of the Gentry of that countrey refu|&s;e to obey the &s;aid command, and are re&s;olved to a&s;si&s;t the Parliament again&s;t all that &s;hall op|po&s;e them, profering their own per&s;ons to both Hou&s;es to maintaine the &s;aid Cau&s;e: and for that end have de&s;ired the Parliament to &s;end &s;uch forces as might &s;ecure them in &s;o doing.</P>

<P>As the faces of all <HI>Britaine</HI> &s;hew their hearts and inclinations, &s;o if their hearts were tran&s;|parent, and as per&s;picuous as their faces, they would appeare fearfull of the future, were not the Repre&s;entative Body of the State carefull to cure the pre&s;ent malady, by qualifying and tempering the di&s;tempered humours, and &s;ave the much indangered body, by cutting off &s;ome rotten and putrified members which infect, in|fe&s;t and invade the republique: and herein con&s;i&s;ts a great part of the happine&s;&s;e of this Kingdome, which (next under the Searcher of hearts) is derived unto us by the pious care and indu&s;try of the Parliament, in that they have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;efull in di&s;covering and &s;earching out of the plots &amp; machinations of the adver&s;e party, and &s;o indulgent and friendly to all &s;uch as are well-affected to the peace and welfare of this Kingdome. Nor is there amity and friend|&s;hip circum&s;cribed and terminated within this Kingdome of <HI>England,</HI> but is further &s;hewed in the unity and corre&s;pondence betwixt us and our Brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though &s;o many ill-affected &s;pirits have endeavoured a disiunction. A further degree of our happines in this I&s;land is to be &s;een in the mutuall concord betwixt us and the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> who&s;e confederacie with this Nation hath been happy, and all their de&s;ignes &s;econded with &s;ucce&s;&s;e &s;ince their fir&s;t union. They have lately declared their fideli|ty
<PB N="5" REF="4">and good affection to the Parliament in cer|taine letters pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e, wherein is intimated and declared to them their true, re|all, and con&s;tant affection and re&s;olution to the Parliament. Their actions &s;hew as much as their words, which is further manife&s;ted in an overthrow given to the Fleet of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> go|ing to aid the Bebels in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the 15 of this moneth nine &s;hips &s;et out from <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> &s;ailing with all &s;peed to the coa&s;ts of <HI>Ireland:</HI> but the Lord of the &s;eas be|ing di&s;plea&s;ed with their intentions pro&s;pered not their proceedings, but rai&s;ed a great tem|pe&s;t which drove them back upon the coa&s;t of <HI>England<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> but fearing to come too neer by rea|&s;on of the Earle of <HI>Warwicks</HI> Fleet they ca&s;t an|chor about 41. leagues di&s;tant from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> coa&s;t, and &s;taying there two dayes by rea&s;on of a contrary wind, they e&s;pied two Flemi&s;h &s;hips &s;ailing neer them, which cau&s;ed a great feare and jealou&s;ie in them, &s;u&s;pecting they would de&s;cry them to the Dutch Fleet which lay by the way as they were to &s;aile homeward, which indeed they did, de&s;cribing the number of the Spani&s;h Fleet, and in what place they lay: which occa&s;ioned the Dutch Admirall (a terrible e|nemy again&s;t the Spaniard) with all &s;peed to prepare five &s;hips of warre to hoi&s;e &s;ail toward the Fleet of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> going him&s;elfe in per&s;on, and coming in &s;ight of them hanged out his co|lours,
<PB N="6" REF="5">and making all ready for the fight, com|ing neer made &s;hot again&s;t them, the fight la&s;t|ing full two houres, and many men being &s;lain on both &s;ides, at la&s;t two of the Spani&s;h &s;hips were &s;unk, which di&s;hearthed the re&s;t, and for|ced them to flight: the Durch Admirall cha|&s;ed them within &s;ix leagues of <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> where he took two of them loaden with ammunition, intended for the aid of the Iri&s;h Rebels, but the other five, being &s;wift of &s;aile, e&s;caped into <HI>Dunkirk.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords and Commons in Parliament declare. That all &s;uch per&s;ons as &s;hall upon any pretence what&s;oever, a&s;si&s;t His Maie&s;ty in this Warte, with Hor&s;e, Arms, Plate or Money, are Traytors to His Maie&s;ty, the Parliament and Kingdome, and &s;hall be brought to con|digne puni&s;hment for &s;o high an offence.</P>
