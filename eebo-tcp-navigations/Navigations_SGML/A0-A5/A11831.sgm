<P>_HAuing taken our iourney to|ward <HI>Virginia</HI> in the begin|ing of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t in a &s;hip called the blacke <HI>Hodge,</HI> her burthen 160. tun mann'd only with 8. Iron peeces and a poore Faulcon, we &s;oone ouer pa&s;&s;ed both the tedious endurances and fearefull dangers of &s;uch a voyage, and came at la&s;t by the 14. of <HI>March</HI> vnder 13. and halfe Latitude, within 20 leagues of <HI>Matalina</HI> by 6. of clocke in the mor|ning, the weather &s;omwhat thicke, &amp; the wind affording a rea&s;onable gale, whereby we de&s;cri|ed a &s;hip lying at hull, as if &s;he were carele&s;&s;e either to go backward, or forward; which cau|&s;ed vs to edge with her, as de&s;irous to know what &s;he was: but &s;he pre&s;ently &s;et vp all her &s;ayles, and taking a cour&s;e of South and by We&s;t ran quickly out of &s;ight in the &s;pace of three or foure gla&s;&s;es: this made vs keepe our cour&s;e for <HI>Matalina,</HI> which we attained by the nex day at night, being the 15. of <HI>March,</HI> and &s;o wa&s;ting the Iland of <HI>Dominico,</HI> wee bare with <HI>Guardalupo,</HI> and there anchored to take in fre&s;h water which we wanted.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Then came aboord vs certaine <HI>Indians,</HI> and 6. <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> who had remained there &s;ome 16. moneths, being ca&s;t vpon the land by &s;hip|wracke, and &s;o were vnprouided for a further iourney: they enformed vs of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> man of warre that pa&s;t along &s;ome &s;euen dayes before di&s;charging her ordinance at the inhabitants, and putting the Iland in great feare, notwith|&s;tanding &s;ome two dayes before there ancho|red another &s;hip, who&s;e Captaine with &s;ome &s;ouldiers came a &s;hore with wine and other proui&s;ion, as if they meant to make merry and &s;hew all the &s;ignes of friend&s;hip and content|ment: but &s;he &s;tayd but one night at anchor, and &s;o departed without further notice; what cour&s;e &s;he meant to take, nor could the inha|bitants gue&s;&s;e, by rea&s;on their feare enforced their flight, into the mountaines, le&s;t they &s;hould bee &s;urpri&s;ed: onely wee were ad|uerti&s;ed by certaine <HI>Indians,</HI> that they deter|mined for S^t. <HI>Vincents,</HI> leauing word, that whe~ the great Fleete pa&s;&s;ed along they &s;hould en|forme the Generall, that Captaine <HI>Bartholo|mew</HI> was gone vp in pro&s;ecution of his dire|ctions.</P>
<P>This was the &s;hip we de&s;cryed at Hull and &s;o re&s;olued &s;hee mu&s;t needes bee &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> man of warre, becau&s;e no Marchant, or &s;hip of burthen would lo&s;e the aduantage of &s;o fayre a
<PB REF="3"> winde to tran&s;port her to any port of trafficke and &s;pend the time in hulling, as if &s;he lay of purpo&s;e to di&s;couer &s;ome pri&s;e, and take the aduantage of &s;uch pa&s;&s;engers as were to go to <HI>Menis,</HI> being the common trade way both for <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and &s;o as it appeared after|ward &s;he &s;tirred that cour&s;e of purpo&s;e, both to deceiue the Ilanders, &amp; to betray vs, whom they had de&s;cryed a farre off.</P>
<P>From <HI>Guardalupa</HI> wee departed the 18. of <HI>March</HI> ha&s;ting to <HI>Menis,</HI> and &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t, held a loofe a halfe road to be the more free fro~ the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by rea&s;on we determined to repaire our &s;hip, &amp; refre&s;h our &s;elues at <HI>Me|nis:</HI> The &s;hip being much beaten with a dange|rous &s;torme &s;ome 70. leagues from our owne coa&s;t, the people much di&s;tempered as hauing bene a 11. weeks impri&s;oned in an ill conditio|ned &s;hip, and peraduenture wanting many ne|ce&s;&s;aries, which commonly we prepare for long voyages.</P>
<P>But &s;uch was the plea&s;ure of God, that wee were preuented and di&s;appointed in the&s;e pur|po&s;es, for falling with <HI>Menis</HI> by the 20. of <HI>March,</HI> and compa&s;&s;ing the furthe&s;t point to &s;tand in the hand&s;ommer with the &s;hore, wee perceiued two tall &s;hips at anchor right ouer|again&s;t the watring place with their top &s;ayles loo&s;e, and their boates going a &s;hore for their men. At fir&s;t we &s;uppo&s;ed them <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in
<PB REF="4"> re&s;pect of their building, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ours borne by their Admirall in the mayne top, the vice Admirall hauing his fore-top ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> downe, and no colours di&s;played, which encrea&s;ed our former opinion, adding withall that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> mu&s;t needs bee pri&s;e or &s;ome other &s;hip &s;ub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">t to the misfortune of a fight.</P>
<P>But driuen by nece&s;&s;ity of water, and wil|ling to refre&s;h our &s;elues a &s;hore, we trimmed our &s;hip, and came to anchor fayrely by them, &s;ending our boate in friendly manner to hale them both vnprouided and vnarmed, which returned with certificate, that they were <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> wherein not fully &s;atisfied by rea&s;on of our former apprehen&s;ion that it was otherwi&s;e the better to be re&s;olued, we &s;ent out our boat againe, as well to be a&s;&s;ured what to tru&s;t vnto as to gaine &s;ometime to prepare our &s;hip, and trim her more commodiou&s;ly, being pe&s;tered with goods and fardels betweene the deckes and altogether vnprouided for any fight ey|ther offen&s;iue or defen&s;iue.</P>
<P>The boate approched the hindmo&s;t &s;hip, which I call the vice-Admirall, and haled her, demanding who they were, but in &s;teed of re|&s;oluing vs, &s;hee commanded them to come a|boord, and would an&s;wer no otherwi&s;e, where|vpon the boat rowed from them, as re&s;oluing all was not well, and &s;o made ha&s;te vnto vs a|gaine, yet could not preuent a volley of &s;mall
<PB REF="4"> &s;hot powred very dangerou&s;ly among&s;t them, in&s;omuch that they had their cloathes &s;hot through, their oares &s;hiuered, and the &s;ides battered with bullets: yet thankes bee to God neither was a man hurt, nor any thing lo&s;t, which, as if they had had notice of the &s;ame e|&s;cape, rated their rage &s;o much the more. For by that time the boat was out of reach of their &s;mall &s;hot, they followed it to the &s;hip with great Ordnance, and when they per|ceiued they were &s;afely come aboord, they tooke it &s;o ill, that they thundred again&s;t our &s;hip with the &s;oarer rage, and mo&s;t violent vol|lyes, which wee could not an&s;wer, hauing no peece in our gunner roome, nor indeed any o|ther well mounted for &s;uch a Sea fight.</P>
<P>By this time we vnder&s;tood what they were, and re&s;olued wee &s;hould not depart quietly without mi&s;chiefe, whereupon our Ma&s;ter &s;et vs on worke to haue brought our Ordnance into frame, and &s;o to order our &s;hip that wee might defend our &s;elues if need were, but ma|ny things failing vs, we practi&s;ed to weigh our anchors, which was not to be done &s;o &s;odain|ly, confidering our encombrances on &s;hip boord: we then re&s;olud to weigh it vp with the boat, had not &s;o many &s;hot thundred among&s;t vs, that we wondred at our e&s;cape.</P>
<P>By this time their vice Admirall heaued vp her anchor to her warpe, and laid her &s;elfe to
<PB REF="5"> wind-ward, if either wee &s;hould pa&s;&s;e forward, or anchor &s;hort againe, &s;o that wee perceiued they meant to a&s;&s;ault vs on all hands: for &s;hee let flie a whole broad &s;ide vpon vs, and came furiou&s;ly vp to our lee quarter without da|mage or re&s;i&s;tance of our parts, to which &s;ure they were the rather induced becau&s;e the Ad|mirall hauing receiued her men from &s;hore, her top &s;ayle loo&s;e all ready, and many things commodious to their purpo&s;e, began to weigh anchor, and made toward vs amaine.</P>
<P>But when we were thus terrified and threat|ned by them, and thus encombred and di&s;ani|mated among&s;t our &s;elues, knowing withall (by rea&s;on of our ill prepared Ordnance) the di&s;aduantage and hazard to be boorded at an|chor by two good &s;hips well prepared for &s;poyle and ruine, we hoy&s;ed vp our &s;ayles, and determined to &s;et forward, had not the vice-Admirall come on our &s;tar-boord &s;ide, and beat vpon vs &s;o hardly, that we fell to our bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e, and an&s;wered their vnkindne&s;&s;e accor|dingly with many faire &s;hot, which prooued mo&s;t effectuall, e&s;pecially from a demy culue|ring, which at la&s;t &s;hot her betweene winde &amp; water, &s;o that &s;he was compelled from vs, and bare off to Sea, leauing her Admirall onely &s;ingle with vs, who at la&s;t came fairely in our quarter to wind-ward, taking in her <HI>Holland</HI> flag, and aduanced her <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> colours, and &s;o
<PB REF="5"> haled vs.</P>
<P>Wee quietly and quickly an&s;wered, both what we were, and whither we were bound, di|&s;couering the effect of our commi&s;&s;ion, and re|lating the cau&s;e of our tarying there for water, neither purpo&s;ing to annoy any &s;ubiect of the king of <HI>Spains,</HI> nor by way of affront to braue either Marchant or man of Warre. Then &s;he charged vs to &s;trike our &s;ailes for the king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and vaile the bonnet according to the prerogatiue they had in tho&s;e Seas: we replyed with enlarging the particulars of the league betweene the King our Ma&s;ter and their king, adding withall, that as we intended no ill, wee would take no wrong, whereupon the Ma&s;ter left the poope, and &s;eque&s;tred him&s;elfe from &s;uch open conference; had they not called for the Captaine againe, who at la&s;t pre&s;ented him&s;elfe, till they commanded him to come aboord with his commi&s;&s;ion, which he refu&s;ed yet wi&s;hed them to &s;end their boat aboord, &amp; then they &s;hould &s;ee it mo&s;t willingly.</P>
<P>But in&s;tead either of an&s;wering vs further with kind words, or accepting of our reply in good part, they made two great &s;hot at vs, and poured among vs &s;uch a volley of &s;mall &s;hot, before wee could get off the poope, that wee thanked God they did no more harme, yet we were much amazed they did &s;o much: not thus content they waued vs mith their bright

<P>The fight continued &s;ome halfe houre in our quarter, and according to the terror of &s;uch encounters, we were compa&s;t as it were in fire and &s;moake, vntill they di&s;couered the wa&s;t of our &s;hip naked, and were encouraged with the hope of reciprocall damage, whereupon they brauely ran vpon our &s;ide, and layd vs aboord lufe to lufe, ha&s;tning with pikes and &s;words to enter, to which was added &s;uch fury, that if they had not beene preuented, we &s;hould haue &s;hrunke vnder the rage of a barbarous &s;laugh|ter: but it plea&s;ed God &s;o to direct our Ma&s;ter with aduice, and encourage our men with va|lour, that our pikes being formerly placed vn|der our halfe decke, and certaine &s;hot lying clo&s;e for that purpo&s;e vnder the portels of the &s;hip, encountred them &s;o brauely, that their fu|ry was not onely rebated, but their ha&s;tine&s;&s;e intercepted, and the whole company beaten
<PB REF="6"> backe, e&s;pecially vpon the wind-ward &s;ide, where the charge was hotte&s;t, and the fight bloodie&s;t; for there the throng was great, and men had worke enough to make proofe of their courages &amp; fortunes, diuers of our men were hurt, and many fell on their &s;ide; if a man retired wounded with vs, two I am &s;ure were &s;laine among&s;t them; if their pikes reached as farre as our bodyes, ours were long enough to fa&s;ten in their &s;ides; if a Parti&s;on fro~ the~ ga&s;hed our armes, a Halbard from vs lighted on their heads: yea, we came &s;o neere, that &s;words cut pikes a &s;under, and targets were hewed with the blowes, &s;o that if a fight were woorth the de&s;cribing: it is pitty that &s;ome great Com|manders on both &s;ides beheld not this, to re|cord the action to memory, and recompence the men with &s;ufficient reward.</P>
<P>In the end they were violently repul&s;ed by vs, enforced to a retreat, vntill they were rein|forced backe againe by their Commanders, who &s;tanding vpon tearmes of honour, as be|ing men of warre, and de&s;igned for that pur|po&s;e, thought it an indignity to be &s;o afronted and countermaunded, which cau&s;ed a &s;econd charge, and that was an&s;wered with a &s;econd beating backe, till the Captaine him&s;elfe grew enraged, as not brooking to bee &s;o much ouer|mated, and con&s;trained them to come on a fre&s;h, which they did &s;o effectually, that que|&s;tionle&s;&s;e
<PB REF="7"> it had wrought an alteration, if the God that to&s;&s;eth Monarchies, and teareth the Mountaines in his fury, had not taught vs to to&s;&s;e our pikes with pro&s;perous euent, and poured out a &s;odaine volley of &s;mall &s;hot vp|on them, whereby that worthy Commander was &s;laine at the foote of a pike and many of his &s;ouldiers dropped down on the top of the hatches.</P>
<P>This we &s;aw with our eyes, and reioyced at with our hearts, &s;o that we might perceiue as it were good &s;ucce&s;&s;e comming on, &amp; deliue|rance to breake through the thicking cloud of that vengeance which was prepared again&s;t vs: for pre&s;ently our Ma&s;ter tooke aduantage of their di&s;comfiture (though with &s;ome commi|&s;eration for that valiant Captaine &s;o &s;laine) that he not only plyed them a fre&s;h with great ordinance, but had more fal&s;e &s;hot vnder the pikes, which were be&s;towed to good purpo&s;e, &amp; ama&s;ed our enemies with the &s;odainne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the re&s;t one <HI>Lucas</HI> our Carpen|ters mate mu&s;t not be forgotte~, who perceiued a way how to annoy them, as they were thus pu&s;led and in a confu&s;ion, drue out a minion which hee nobly &s;et a worke vnder the halfe decke, till at the la&s;t he brought it to the doxe of the halfe decke, and there bent it vpon them but in &s;uch a manner, that when it was fiered the ca&s;es full of &s;tones and peeces of Iron fell
<PB REF="7"> vpon them like haile, and cleared their decke in &s;uch a &s;ort that it &s;lue many, and in &s;hort time we &s;aw few a&s;&s;ailants, but onely &s;uch as crept from place to place very couertly, and &s;eemed willing to ob&s;cure them&s;elues from the fury of our &s;hot, which now was thicker then theirs. For although (as farre as wee may commend our enemies) they had done &s;ome things wor|thy of admiration: yet either wanting men, or ouertaken with the vnlooked for valour of our company, they now began to &s;hrinke, and gaue vs leaue to be wanton with our aduantage.</P>
<P>Yet were our great Ordnance onely foure that wee could v&s;e in this fight, but it &s;hould &s;eeme they &s;erued the turne as well as foure times foure: for they &s;hot her diuers times be|tweene winde and water, and &s;o preuailed, that at la&s;t we &s;aw many &s;ignes of their willingnes to leaue vs, but by rea&s;on &s;he was fa&s;t in a &s;lach of our cable, which in ha&s;t of weighing our anchor hung loo&s;e, &s;he could not be diuided nor make that way &s;he purpo&s;ed, vntill one of our men cut it with an axe without direction, and was &s;laine for his labour. But when &s;hee perceiued &s;he was loo&s;e, after &s;he had beene a boord two houres and a halfe, good Lord what ha&s;t &s;he made, and how quickly were we diuided, both great and &s;mall &s;hot playing on both &s;ides, which la&s;ted vntill the remotene&s;&s;e was aboue a Caliuer &s;hot, and we di&s;couered
<PB REF="8"> the vice Admirall comming to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, who began a farre off to ply vs with great &s;hot and put vs in mind, wee had another worke in hand.</P>
<P>Whereupon wee manned our &s;hip a new, &s;eparating the dead and hurt bodies by them|&s;elues from vs, and were &s;o encouraged, that we waued her, and in a manner made toward her to fight a fre&s;h. For whe~ we perceiued, that the Admirall made not a &s;hot more at vs, wee verily imagined, that either &s;he was preparing her &s;elfe with a new &s;upply, or wanted men to make her &s;eruiceable, or re&s;olued to goe away from vs, con&s;idering &s;he had lo&s;t her Captain; yet loth to be &s;ecure, and imagining the vice Admirall might come and boord vs finding vs play, till the Admirall did make her &s;elfe better ready, wee prepared our &s;elues, wondring yet that &s;he came no neerer vs then Falcon &s;hot, wherewith &s;he plyed vs &s;till on the lee fide, vn|till at la&s;t &s;he receiued another payment from our demy Culuering, which &s;hot her through, &amp; made her beare with the &s;hore into &s;mooth water, where &s;he remained till 2. of the clocke after midnight, and &s;o we had time to reforme our di&s;orders, and make our &s;elues better rea|dy for the next dayes varietie.</P>
<P>By breake of day &s;hee came vp againe with the Admirall with her; as if they determined indeed to deuoure vs at once; but as it &s;eemed
<PB REF="8"> it was but a Brauado, though for the time they for&s;ooke not our quarter within Musket &s;hot: for all that night and morning they were qui|et neighbours, and kept vs company without any great anoya~ce with their top &s;ailes down, not knowing, as it &s;hould &s;eeme, what to doe with vs, or el&s;e &s;u&s;pecting their owne hurts and leakes, they dur&s;t not tru&s;t them&s;elues too far from land, nor to the fury of another encoun|ter.</P>
<P>All that night wee had time and ley&s;ure to ouerlooke our lo&s;&s;es, and prepare for them if they a&s;&s;ayled vs againe; and indeed wee were better prouided then before, &amp; better accom|modated in our &s;hip, as freeing it from former encombrances, &amp; affoording farre more &s;cope for our Ordnance to play vpon them: but God be thanked it fell out otherwi&s;e: for though we might perceiue them &s;peake together, and with many yards a cro&s;&s;e entend to keepe vs company; yet did they not make much ha&s;t vp, nor trouble vs with many &s;hot, till the next day the Admirall made &s;hew of an encounter, and we after prayers were ended prouided to fight with them, but &s;odainely wee perceiued the vice Admirall hang a &s;terne, cutting her maine &s;ayle to come vp, and &s;tirring very ill, which a&s;toni&s;hed vs the more, becau&s;e wee could not imagine the rea&s;on, con&s;idering &s;he was the be&s;t &s;ayler and now &s;pared her Admi|rall
<PB REF="9"> a fore-top &s;ayle, &s;hewing all the &s;ignes of retracting, and no de&s;ire to come too neere vs any more.</P>
<P>At length the Admirall &s;hooke in the wind and by apparant &s;ignes gaue vs notice of &s;lack|ing her cour&s;e, whereby we might run a head and follow the &s;eas at our plea&s;ure, &s;o we per|ceiued the vice Admirall with all her &s;ailes to make towards an Iland called <HI>Sana,</HI> which the Admirall either tooke notice of, as knowing the danger &s;he was in, or gaue directions ac|cordingly, con&s;idering there was no good to be done with vs: for pre&s;ently &s;he tacked about and lo&s;t vs, bearing toward that Iland al&s;o, which wee ea&s;ily di&s;couered with her whole length: but the &s;hips were quickly out of &s;ight, although wee &s;aw the breach of the &s;heare all along, and how the Admirall departed from vs, which cau&s;ed vs to imagine, that &s;hee was forced a &s;hore by her leakes receiued in the fight, and dur&s;t not aduenture for feare &s;hee &s;hould haue beene &s;uncke altogether, &amp; que|&s;tionle&s;&s;e the Admirall had neuer gone from our &s;ides, nor tryed any fortune but our cour|te&s;ie, if we could by any meanes haue brought ouer our demy Culuering on our fighting &s;ide which was endeuoured by our Ma&s;ter &amp; Gun|ner: but as you haue heard our &s;hip being &s;o encombred, it was in vaine, and we little drea|ming, either of Pirats or aduer&s;ary in tho&s;e
<PB REF="9"> &s;eas, made le&s;&s;e account to bee intercepted in this manner: but &s;uch is the condition of hu|maine life, that commonly mi&s;chiefes come vnlooked for, and when they come, accompa|ny one another with much variety, e&s;pecially at Sea, where I will bee bold to &s;ay, that a fight is more terrible to frailty, and yeeldeth greater occa&s;ion of a&s;toni&s;hment, then a maine battle at land, or the &s;urpri&s;ing of a towne in the fury of an execution.</P>
<P>This fight continued fiue or &s;ixe houres, &amp; was the more vnwelcome, becau&s;e we were &s;o vnprouided, and had no intents, nor gaue any occa&s;ion to di&s;turbe them, as for the lo&s;&s;e of men, and accidentall troubles if religion had not taught vs, what by Gods prouidence is brought to pa&s;&s;e; yet morality and dayly expe|rience might enforme vs of the dangers of warre, and perils at Sea, by &s;torms, tempe&s;ts, &s;hipwrackes, encountring with Pirats, mee|ting with enemies, cro&s;&s;e winds, long voyages, vnkown &s;hores, barbarous nations, deuouring mon&s;ters, and a hundred inconueniences, of which humane policies are not capable, nor mens coniectures apprehen&s;iue.</P>
<P>We lo&s;t Doctor <HI>Bohune,</HI> and &s;euen other were &s;laine out right: two died &s;hortly after of their wounds, and 16. were &s;hot through in &s;ome part or other of the body, who&s;e wounds Gods be thanked were recured and without
<PB REF="10"> maime or further impeachment of health are now recouered and &s;etled in <HI>Virginia,</HI> accor|ding to our fir&s;t entended purpo&s;e and Com|mi&s;&s;ion: I reckon not &s;uch as are hurt with pikes and other offen&s;iue weapons, becau&s;e there was no danger in their cures, and the skilfull Surgeon &s;hewed his art &amp; good &s;peed with facility. How many they lo&s;t we ca~not tel, nor what men of name were entertained a|mong&s;t them, onely I am &s;ure we &s;aw many lye &s;laine on the decke, and more ca&s;t ouer boord in the fight, be&s;ides the &s;cuppers ran with blood, and the very Sea in their quarter was coloured with a Scarlet hue, and looked fear|fully vpon vs all.</P>
<P>O the ambition and turbulency of mens na|tures, and the ill condition of reuenge, that cannot bee contented with faire &s;atisfaction, vnle&s;&s;e it be an&s;wered with death and blood: I &s;peake not of the vniu&s;tifiable proceedings of Pirates, becau&s;e the diuell hath any &s;cu&s;e fo &s;uch theft, fro~ the nece&s;&s;ity of life &amp; the terror of pouerty, which ca~not be preuented in great and &s;turring &s;pirits without cour&s;e of actiue imployment, or &s;ome endeauours or other: but of the in&s;atiate pride of the heart, and the wicked di&s;po&s;ition of mallice, which is ne|uer &s;atisfied, but with the death and de&s;tructio~ of an enemy, as was apparant in this encoun|ter. For we could not imagin, why they &s;hould
<PB REF="10"> aduenture thus vpo~ vs, vnle&s;&s;e to make vs pri&s;e, and &s;ubiect to the &s;poyle of robbery. As for the pretence of their kings prerogatiue, there was not &s;o much as a thought of afronting the~ in that kinde, had they not in&s;ulted as it were ouer vs in an ouerdaring manner, and com|manded vs to that which we knew was di&s;ho|nourable to our nation and di&s;gratious to our &s;elues: but for feare of laui&s;hes and bur&s;tings out of frailty, I will now de&s;i&s;t, either from complayning of them, or ex&s;cu&s;ing our &s;elues; &amp; only conclude, there were &s;ome hreat faults co~mitted among&s;t vs all on both &s;ides, which the God of heauen determined to puni&s;h in this manner, and that God of heauen direct vs to make v&s;e of his iudgements, that we not on|ly pray to him for the diuer&s;ion of his wrath from our &s;innes, but yeeld him all po&s;&s;ible prai&s;e and thank&s;giuing for any deliuerance, or ble&s;&s;ing what&s;oeuer, and more particularly for this our vnlookt for e&s;cape from &s;o great a danger.</P>
<P>The buhthen of their Admirall was 300. tuns, hauing 22. peeces of Bra&s;&s;e, and all pro|ui&s;ion of a man of Warre indeed: their Vice-Admirall 300. tuns, and 16. ca&s;t peeces, nor much inferior to her for trimming and corre|&s;pondent equipage, and both to the out|ward &s;hew ouer-ma&s;terfull and daring for one poore Marchant and pa&s;&s;enger, being but a
<PB REF="11"> 160. tuns, hauing 8. Iron peeces and one Fal|con, ouerloaden with &s;tuffe and wares, encom|bred with pa&s;&s;engers, toyled with a &s;torme, ti|red with a long voyage, affrighted with wants, and euery way in&s;ufficient to an&s;wer any &s;uch enemy: but as it in the Scripture, it is all one to thee O God, whether there bee few or many, and <HI>Gedeons</HI> 300. &s;hall &s;lay many thou&s;ands of the <HI>Midianites:</HI> as for deliuerances, the people of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;hall pa&s;&s;e through the red Sea dry foot: <HI>Ionas</HI> &s;hall be ca&s;t &s;afe on &s;hore out of the Whales belly: and <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hal e&s;cape &s;hipwrack, &s;auing his life with all his pa&s;&s;engers in the I|land of <HI>Malia.</HI> For to conclude with the pur|po&s;e in hand, there is one thing mo&s;t remarke|able as an inducement to this our deliuerance, that Captaine <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> embraced Doctor <HI>Bo|hune</HI> being mortally wounded, &amp; thus recom|forted him, &s;aying, O Doctor <HI>Bohune</HI> what a di&s;a&s;ter is this; the noble Doctor no whit exa|nimated, replyed; Fight it out braue man, the cau&s;e is good, and Lord receiue my &s;oule.</P>
