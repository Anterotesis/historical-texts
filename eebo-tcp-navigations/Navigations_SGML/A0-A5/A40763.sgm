<P>THE joyful News of Sir <HI>Clowd&s;ley Shovel</HI>'s Succe&s;s at <HI>Dublin</HI>-Harbour, has much Elevated the de|pre&s;t Spirits of our poor Friends here; and I doubt not but it will meet with the like joyful accep|tance where-ever it comes, which has much induced me to &s;end you this Letter, which will give you an account of a notable Engagement.</P>
<P>THe before-mentioned Worthy Commander, with the Squa|dron of Ships mentioned in my la&s;t, Arrived &s;afe on <HI>Good-Friday</HI> la&s;t, in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Dublin,</HI> where he &s;pyed in the Harbour, the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Admiral (a <HI>Scoth</HI> Ship taken from Captain <HI>Hammilton,</HI> and now Commanded by one <HI>Patrick Bennet</HI>) with about Twenty other Ve&s;&s;els of &s;maller Burthen, Laden with Hides, Tal|low,
<PB N="2" REF="2">and Butter, riding at Anchor in <HI>Polebeg,</HI> within the Bar. Where|upon the Captain quitted his own Ship (She being of too great a Bur|then to enter the Harbour,) and went on Board the <HI>Monmouth</HI>-Yatch, and with That, and Two more, he went over the Bar, Steering his Cour&s;e directly towards the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>-Admiral, who cut her Cables, and endeavoured to run up to <HI>Kingsend-Point</HI> (as the other Ve&s;&s;els did, du|ring the Engagement,) but Sir <HI>Clowd&s;ley Shovel</HI> being under Sail, approached &s;o fa&s;t, that he forced an Engagement; and the Fight la&s;ted an hour, being clo&s;ely fol|lowed on both &s;ides; after which, Captain <HI>Bennet</HI> &s;eeing little hopes of Victory, and perceiving many of his Men to lye dead on the Decks, he run the Ship on ground, on the South <HI>Strand,</HI> and the Capt. and what Men he had left alive, made their E&s;cape, and got on Shore, leaving his Ship a Prize to that Worthy Commander, our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Captain. The Firing &s;o briskly in the Harbour, &s;oon Al|larmed the City, whereupon King <HI>James,</HI> and his &s;mall Army, being Two Regiments of Foot, and One of Hor&s;e, came down on the <HI>Strand,</HI> by <HI>Andrew Cave</HI>'s Hou&s;e (about half a Mile from <HI>Ringsend</HI>) dread|ing an Inva&s;ion, and fearing the bu&s;ine&s;s would have gone farther than the lo&s;s of his Ships. Sir <HI>Clowd&s;ley</HI> Man'd out &s;ome long Boats, and by the help of the Tide, brought off the Ve&s;&s;el: King <HI>James</HI> him&s;elf being a Spectator, and Eye|witne&s;s of this our Commanders Bravery, and his own great lo&s;s: And I believe was glad it proceeded no farther. All the Oppo&s;ition his gazing Soldiers gave, was, Two <HI>French</HI> Troops rid into the Water, and &s;hot their Pi&s;tols again&s;t the &s;ide of the Ship: In recompence whereof, a Shot was &s;ent from the Ship, which brought one of the Troopers into the Water, his Hor&s;e being &s;hot under him.</P>
<P>Two Boys ran from the Shore (being <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI>) up to their Necks in Water, de&s;iring help from the Sea-men, and were taken up by one of the long Boats.</P>
<P>In this Action we lo&s;t not a Man, neither had we any but one Wound|ed, though there were found in the Enemies Ve&s;&s;els Twenty Dead, be&s;ides others, which in the Fight, undoubtedly dropt over-Board.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> la&s;t came in here Forty Five Waggons, belonging to the Train of Artillery; and ye&s;ter|day Morning they went down to <HI>Highlake.</HI></P>
<P>Ye&s;terday came in here Count <HI>Na&s;&s;aw</HI>'s Regiment of Foot: And to Morrow comes in another Regi|ment of Foot.</P>
<P>We hear from <HI>Lisburne,</HI> of the 14th In&s;tant, That the Forces Shipt off at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> are &s;afely Arrived there, con&s;i&s;ting of Three Thou|&s;and Men: And that Fifty Thou|&s;and Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> came thither that day: And that our Men are Hearty, and the Weather good; &s;o that we &s;uddenly expect to hear of further Action.</P>
