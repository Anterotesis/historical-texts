<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I had the honour to wait up|you in your Travels to <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o I had the oppotunity of making &s;ome Remarks in our way thi|ther, and from thence to <HI>Naples;</HI> where the Antiquities are not le&s;s curious than what you &s;aw in <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf; which I here humbly pre&s;ent
<PB REF="3">
you with a review of in a piece of pro&s;pective: Which, though it be done by an ill hand, yet it may help to Commemorate to you most of the Re|markable Things you took notice of when you was there. I had not room in this &s;mall Tract to mention any thing of Politicks, or Con&s;titution of Governments in any of the&s;e Princes Courts or Republicks that we pa&s;&s;ed through, having no de&s;ign at pre&s;ent but to point out to you the way you Travelled, and the Distance from Place to Place, with Ob&s;ervations made of the Antiquities of <HI>Rome, Naples,</HI> and other Places; together with the Strength, Beauty and Sci|tuation of &s;ome other Towns and Forts in <HI>Italy;</HI> the be&s;t Painting, Carving, and Limning, and &s;ome other both Na|tural and Artificial Curio&s;ities, which you your &s;elf took &s;uch particular No|tice of, that they cannot but remain &s;till fre&s;h in your Memory: However I have made bold to pre&s;ent you with this Poor A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which may

A <HI>New JO&V;RNAL</HI> FROM GENEVE TO ROME And from thence to NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P>SIR, You may well remember when you left <HI>England</HI> and went to <HI>Paris</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> there to carry on that Noble Education you Commenced at home, you en|tred your &s;elf in one of the be&s;t Academies, and there continued near Two Years and an Half;
<PB N="2" REF="5">
from whence, after a more than ordinary Improvement in the Li|beral Arts and Sciences, and other the Studies and Exerci&s;es of that Place; your Genius led you to make a farther Progre&s;s in your Travels; And then you left <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;et forward by the way of <HI>Ly|ons</HI> for <HI>Geneve,</HI> where after you had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time you re&s;olved to go for <HI>Italy;</HI> &s;o that taking your leave of <HI>Geneve,</HI> you came to a little Town called <HI>Remille</HI> in <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;even Leagues from <HI>Geneve,</HI> where we lay the fir&s;t night; within three Leagues of this Town lies the Lake of <HI>An&s;i</HI> and Town &s;o called. The 18<HI>th.</HI> we came to <HI>Chambery,</HI> five leagues from <HI>Romillie;</HI> it is the Principal Town in <HI>Savoy,</HI> and where the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> formerly kept his Court, where we &s;taid Dinner, and the &s;ame night lay at <HI>Montmillian,</HI> two leagues from <HI>Chambery,</HI> where we took notice of the Fortre&s;s or Ca&s;tle of <HI>Montmillian,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
It is partly built upon, and partly hewed out of a Rock, e&s;teemed the &s;tronge&s;t that belongs to the Duke of <HI>Savoy. Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> lay 13 months be|fore it, in which time (from three Batteries, whereof one was on the further &s;ide of the River <HI>I&s;ere,</HI> the other two on this &s;ide) he &s;hot in|to the Fort above Ten Thou&s;and Cannon Bullets, and &s;prang Two Mines, all which not an&s;wering his Expectations, and finding him&s;elf unable to take it, although he had taken the Town that joyns to the Fort, concludes a Peace and rai&s;es the Seige. From <HI>Montmillian</HI> we came to St. <HI>Michel,</HI> thirteen leagues all along upon the River <HI>I&s;ere,</HI> or rather <HI>Arche,</HI> becau&s;e it only bears the name of <HI>I&s;ere</HI> near to <HI>Mont|millian,</HI> where we lay the 29<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>The Thirtieth we came to dinner to <HI>Breamant,</HI> five Leagues more, and from thence to <HI>Landbourg,</HI> where we lay that night, being
<PB N="4" REF="6">
two leagues from <HI>Bramont,</HI> &s;till up|on the River <HI>Are.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Oct.</HI> 1. we hired Mules to carry us up the <HI>Alps</HI> by the way of Mount <HI>Senis,</HI> and came to <HI>Rama&s;&s;e</HI> being one league, from thence to the great Cro&s;s two leagues more, which is the highe&s;t part of the Mountain that you go over, from whence we came to <HI>Bo&s;&s;oline</HI> to din|ner, which is about 12 miles more, from thence to <HI>Villiane</HI> eight miles, where we lay that night. And the 2d&punc; of <HI>Oct.</HI> we came to <HI>Turin,</HI> being about ten or twelve miles from <HI>Vil|liane.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Turin</HI> we &s;aw the Duke and Dutche&s;s of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the Prince&s;s his Si&s;ter, that &s;hoots flying &s;o well; we took a view of the Dukes Lodg|ings, and the fine Gallery of Pi|ctures, the black marble Chappel that had been &s;o many years a build|ing, and not fini&s;hed when we &s;aw it, is one of the fine&s;t things in <HI>Tu|rin;</HI> we &s;aw the Church where they
<PB N="5" REF="6">
&s;ay is kept the winding Sheet of our Saviour Chri&s;t, be&s;ides &s;everal other fine Churches: E&s;pecially that of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> in which there is a mo&s;t noble Altar. One of the &s;even days we &s;tayed here, I hapned, in my ramble about the Town to go into a Church, where I heard a great deal of good &s;inging by Eunuchs, and very good mu&s;ick; which be|ing ended, I found by the Peoples gazing and &s;taring, earne&s;tly to one part of the Church, that there was &s;omething more to come, which was as follows; from a corner of the Church, out of &s;ome Chappel, or Ve&s;try, there came a great ma|ny people with great wax lights in their hands, after them followed one of the religious men of that place, with a great &s;ilver Cro&s;s, then followed all the re&s;t of the religious men &s;inging, after them came four Trumpets &s;ounding, then the Image of the V. <HI>Mary</HI> followed, being car|ried upon a frame by four lu&s;ty Fel|lows,
<PB N="6" REF="7">
like Porters, in blue Frocks: The figure was about the bigne&s;s of an ordinary woman, carved out of wood, and very richly dre&s;&s;ed, painted and curled; wearing upper|mo&s;t a long Robe of Cloth of Silver, with a Crown on her head; in her arms &s;he carried a little Image, well carved and finely dre&s;&s;ed, like a lit|tle boy, which repre&s;ented the Savi|our, holding between his hands a pair of Beads; as this Image pa&s;&s;ed through the middle alley of the Church, all the people that could come near it touched it with their Beads, and tho&s;e that could not come near, by rea&s;on of the pre&s;s, handed their Beads from one to ano|ther that they might touch her Garment, from whence undoubted|ly they did believe, proceeded great Virtue: After they came out of the Church it was carried in Proce&s;&s;ion through part of the City, the Trum|pets &s;ounding before, and all people meeting it, or going with it, by
<PB N="7" REF="7">
kneeling, bowing and cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, paid an adoration to it; to my great A&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>About five miles from <HI>Turin</HI> there is a hou&s;e of the Duke of <HI>Savoys,</HI> called the <HI>Venere,</HI> very curious for Painting, Pictures and Waterworks; in the Gardens there is &s;everal &s;ort of Fowl, worth taking notice of.</P>
<P>About a mile from <HI>Turin,</HI> upon the &s;ide of a Hill, there is a fine Convent of <HI>Capu&s;in</HI> Friers; and a fine hou&s;e called the <HI>Valentine,</HI> about half a mile from <HI>Turin,</HI> upon the River <HI>Po:</HI> It was built by Madam <HI>Royall,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoys</HI> Mother, and Si&s;ter to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The new Fortifications that the Duke is making about <HI>Turin,</HI> being all of Brick, con&s;i&s;ting only of Ba|&s;tions and Curtains, are worth your ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The 9<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Oct.</HI> we left <HI>Turin,</HI> and went to <HI>Villeneufe,</HI> a little Garri&s;on of Four&s;core men, ten miles from
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<HI>Turin,</HI> where we dined. The Gar|ri&s;on ob&s;erving us to be ten or twelve Hor&s;emen in company, would not let above two at a time come into the Town. From this town we went to <HI>A&s;te</HI> ten miles more, it being the la&s;t town that way belonging to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> in <HI>Piedmont;</HI> it is indifferently well fortified, and hath four Regiments of Souldiers in it.</P>
<P>From <HI>A&s;te</HI> we came the 11<HI>th&punc;</HI> of <HI>Oct.</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> a great Gar|ri&s;on of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Milo|noi&s;e,</HI> twenty miles from <HI>A&s;te,</HI> from whence the &s;ame night we arrived at <HI>Voltaggio,</HI> two and twenty miles more, where we were forced by tempe&s;tuous weather, of Rain, Wind, Thunder and Hail; which did con|&s;iderable damage in tho&s;e parts, to &s;tay till the 13<HI>th,</HI> and then &s;et out for <HI>Genoua,</HI> where we arrived that night, being twenty miles from <HI>Voltaggio.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Genoua</HI> we &s;aw a great many Churches, very rich, and their
<PB N="9" REF="8">
&s;tructures very noble, being mo&s;t of them within &s;ide cru&s;ted with Marble, and Marble Pillars; we &s;aw &s;everal Noblemens Pallaces, but in particular, that of Seignior <HI>Dalbi,</HI> where among&s;t other fine things, there is a Looking-gla&s;s valued at &s;ixty thou&s;and Crowns; we &s;aw the Doge, and his Pallace, with the Ar|mory, and what el&s;e was mo&s;t con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 16<HI>th.</HI> we went from <HI>Genoua</HI> by Sea, in Barks, &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els &s;o called, that row with four Oars; and lay the fir&s;t night at a place on the Sea &s;hore called <HI>Ce&s;te,</HI> being thirty miles. The 17<HI>th.</HI> we took our Barks again, and went by Sea to <HI>Leri&s;h,</HI> thirty Miles more, where we lay the next day, the weather being bad at Sea we quitted our Ve&s;&s;els, and hired Hor&s;es; and the fir&s;t night lay at <HI>Santa Pietra,</HI> twenty Miles, and thence to <HI>Luca</HI> &s;ixteen Miles, where we lay <HI>Friday</HI> the 19<HI>th.</HI> and &s;aw &s;everal fine
<PB N="10" REF="9">
Churches, in particular, that of St. <HI>Frediano,</HI> where we &s;aw the Coffin that <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, King of <HI>England</HI> was buried in as he went a Pilgrim to <HI>Rome.</HI> In St. <HI>Augu&s;tins</HI> Church they &s;hewed us a place, where a fellow having lo&s;t all his money at Cards, and afterwards ha|ving play'd away all the Cloaths he had from his back, in a great rage began to cur&s;e and to &s;wear, and taking up a Stone, in that mad fit threw it again&s;t the Image of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> from whence imme|diately the blood gu&s;hed out, upon which the ground opened and &s;wal|lowed him up alive. This &s;tory they report to you for a great truth. In another Church they pretend to &s;hew you the fir&s;t Cro&s;s or Crucifix that ever was made after the Cru|cifixion of our Saviour, and tell you the Story thus, that <HI>Nicodemus</HI> ha|ving undertaken the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;haping his work in figure like to a man, had fini&s;hed the Crucifix save
<PB N="11" REF="9">
only the Head, which &s;o puzzled him, that he was not able to go for|ward with it: In the mean time, being wearied with contriving that part of it, but without &s;ucce&s;s, fell a&s;leep, and after &s;ome time being awakened from &s;leep, he found a Head by him &s;ent from Heaven, which he fixed to the re&s;t of his work, and &s;o fini&s;hed the Crucifix&punc; It is all be&s;et with Pearls, Dia|monds, and other Precious Stones, wonderful rich: We &s;aw the Ar|mory, where they &s;ay is Arms &s;uf|ficient for twenty five thou&s;and men. The fortifications of the Town, which is very &s;trong, con|&s;i&s;ts of eleven Ba&s;tions, a Lorillion or ear-fa&s;hion, with Half-moons upon the Curtins: there is planted upon every Ba&s;tion &s;ixteen pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>The 20th of <HI>October</HI> we went from <HI>Luca</HI> to <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> ten miles, where we dined: We &s;aw there the Dome or Cathedral Church, of which the
<PB N="12" REF="10">
four great doors are all of Copper, containing the Hi&s;tory of the four Evangeli&s;ts, repre&s;ented by Figures; hard by this Church, we &s;aw in a kind of Tower, or &s;uch like place, where all the Children are baptized, and where there is the fine&s;t Echo that ever was heard, and in it a Pulpit of Marble that came from <HI>Armenia,</HI> &s;o finely carved that the value of it is ine&s;timable. Hard by this you &s;ee the Leaning Tower, &s;o built, to the admiration of all that &s;ee it, for it hangs over &s;o much, that one would think it mu&s;t needs &s;all, and yet it is believed to &s;tand as &s;trong as if it had been built up|right; &s;o great was the Ingenuity of the Architect. Near the great Church are the Cloy&s;ters to be &s;een, where upon the walls is painted the Hi&s;tory of the Bible: And in the middle of the Cloy&s;ters, upon the right and left hand, there are two little &s;quare Courts, all of holy Earth, they &s;ay brought from <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="10">
wherein if you interr a bo|dy, all &s;hall con&s;ume to the Bones in four and twenty hours time.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> the &s;ame day we went to <HI>Leghorne,</HI> where the only thing worth taking notice of is the Mould, where the Shipping rides &s;afe: The Town is fortified with Ba&s;tions and large Ditches. We went out of cu|rio&s;ity and &s;aw the <HI>Jews</HI> Synagogue in the time of their Devotions.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 23d of <HI>October</HI> we went from <HI>Leghorne</HI> and came again to <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> where we dined, and after dinner went and &s;aw the Phy&s;ick|garden of the Great Duke of <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> in which there is a Gallery furni&s;hed with abundance of Curio|&s;ities; whereof one that I took no|tice of was the Scull of a Man or Woman, with a great piece of Co|ral growing to it; and al&s;o a &s;mall Anchor with &s;everal pieces of Coral naturally fixed to it; both which things were &s;o found in the Sea. We went the &s;ame night to <HI>la Scala,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="11">
a great Inn &s;o called, where we lay, being thirty &s;ix miles from <HI>Leghorne,</HI> and half way between <HI>Pi&s;a</HI> and <HI>Flo|rence.</HI></P>
<P>The next day being the 24th of <HI>October,</HI> we arriv'd at <HI>Florence,</HI> 20 miles from <HI>la Scala,</HI> where we &s;aw the Chappel of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> e&s;teem|ed the fine&s;t of the whole World, for the in&s;ide of it is all Precious Stones, and the Arms of every City belonging to the Great Duke are all of Precious &s;tone inlaid, round about the Chappel; within &s;ide there is likewi&s;e the Statues of all the great Dukes cut out in mar|ble. Fir&s;t <HI>Francis,</HI> then <HI>Co&s;mus</HI> the I. and <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> I. <HI>Co&s;mus</HI> II. <HI>Ferdinandus</HI> II. and <HI>Co&s;mus</HI> at pre|&s;ent, Third of the name, and Sixth great Duke. From this Chappel we went to the Dome or Cathedral Church, with the Tower by it, whereof all the out&s;ide is finely wrought with Marble of divers Co|lours; we &s;aw the great Dukes Pal|lace
<PB N="15" REF="11">
and Gardens, in which there is a great many fine Waterworks: The fine&s;t thing in <HI>Florence</HI> is the Gallery of rich Cabinets, and the Chamber where there is all &s;ort of curious Arms; there is a long barrel of a Gun all of ma&s;&s;y Gold, and &s;everal other great curio&s;ities; we &s;aw the Dukes Armory, the wild Bea&s;ts, and &s;ome fine hou&s;es out of Town, where there is fine Painting and Waterworks, chiefly in that of the great Dukes, called <HI>Pratilin,</HI> &s;ix Miles from <HI>Florence,</HI> we &s;aw be|&s;ides abundance of fine Churches.</P>
<P><HI>November</HI> the Fir&s;t we went from <HI>Florence</HI> to <HI>Pongebouce</HI> 22 miles where we lay. The next day we came to Dinner to <HI>Siena,</HI> 16 miles: It is a Town belonging to the Great Duke, almo&s;t as big as <HI>Florence,</HI> where we &s;aw the Great Church, whereof the Pavement is the fine&s;t in Chri&s;tendom; and the Library with its Pavement, de&s;erves to be ta|ken notice of: From hence we went
<PB N="16" REF="12">
to <HI>Torriniere</HI> 18 miles where we lay. The next day, being the 3<HI>d</HI> of <HI>No|vember,</HI> we lay at <HI>Aquapendente</HI> 29 miles, from whence we came, and dined, the next day being <HI>Sunday</HI> at <HI>Montefiat&s;co,</HI> Fifteen miles, where in a little old Church, under ground, we &s;aw the Tomb of a <HI>German</HI> Bi&s;hop, who, they &s;ay, killed him&s;elf with drink|ing to exce&s;s the Wine of that place: The &s;tory runs thus, That the Bi&s;hop travelling with his re|tinue to <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;ent one of his Ser|vants before upon the Road to find out the be&s;t Wine, with a &s;trict Command to write <HI>EST</HI> upon the Sign, where the Wine was be&s;t; which accordingly he did, and at the fir&s;t place where he found the Wine to be good writ <HI>EST,</HI> which, when the Bi&s;hop &s;aw, concluding the Wine to be very good he &s;top|ped, and with all his Company went in and remained there till he had had his fill of the Wine; then
<PB N="17" REF="12">
he went forward, his Servant the Purveyor, being &s;till before to find out the next place of good Wine, which appeared to the Bi&s;hop be|fore he had travelled much farther, by a double a&s;&s;urance of <HI>EST, EST,</HI> which the Servant had marked up|on the Sign; There the Bi&s;hop &s;tayed longer than he had done at the fir&s;t place of <HI>EST,</HI> finding the Wine to be much better. But at length, in hopes to gratifie his Appetite with a more delicious Wine than what he had met with, goes forward on his Journey to <HI>Rome,</HI> his Servant going &s;till before with the &s;ame Command of provi|ding &s;till the be&s;t Wine with the Old Signal of <HI>EST;</HI> But before he had travelled far he comes to this fatal place of <HI>Montefia&s;co,</HI> where the Wine was &s;o much better than any he had yet met with in his way to <HI>Rome,</HI> that he thought it de&s;erved the triple &s;ignal of <HI>EST, EST, EST,</HI> which accordingly was put upon
<PB N="18" REF="13">
the Sign. The Bi&s;hop being not far behind, &s;oon arrived at this In|chanted Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> where e&s;pying the Signal, immediately made an halt, and with all his Com|pany entred the place, where he found the entertainment &s;o &s;weet, and the Wine &s;o bewitching, that he was not able to leave the place till his life had left him, and then was carried out dead to his Grave, which was hard by in the Vault of a little Church, with a large Stone upon it, and this Epitaph or In&s;cri|ption writ by the Purvoyer his man, in honour of his Ma&s;ter.</P>

they &s;ay &s;ome certain Prince has in keeping, for a great curio&s;ity. From hence we went to the <HI>Charter-hou&s;e,</HI> a Convent of Religious men; the building is very fine, &s;eated upon a high hill, near the City, clo&s;e to the Ca&s;tle of St. <HI>Elmo,</HI> from whence you have the be&s;t &s;ight of <HI>Naples,</HI> and a pro&s;pect of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, which is believed to be the be&s;t in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Upon <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> we hired Hor&s;es and rid out of Town, pa&s;&s;ing through the Grotto of <HI>Pau&s;ilinus,</HI> which <HI>La&s;&s;el</HI> in his Voyage of <HI>Italy</HI> makes mention of. It is near a mile in length, cut, or rather bored through a great Rocky hill, by the Emperour <HI>Lucullus.</HI> It is now u&s;ed as a great high way leading into <HI>Naples;</HI> wherein two Coaches or Carts may meet and pa&s;s by each other ea&s;ily, though the pa&s;&s;age for near three parts of the way be very dark, without any light at all, ex|cept the light of a &s;mall Lamp that
<PB N="22" REF="15">
hangs in a little Chappel dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> in the middle of the pa&s;&s;age, upon the right hand, going into the City. And becau&s;e there may be danger in meeting and running again&s;t one another in the dark, part of the way, when you hear any noi&s;e of Hor&s;e or Coach, or the like, which you may ea&s;ily do at a great di&s;tance, (for the lea&s;t thing in that Concavity makes a great noi&s;e) then you u&s;e the&s;e words, &s;peaking out aloud, <HI>(a la Montagna, &amp; a la Marina)</HI> which &s;ignifies, Which way are you to go, either to that &s;ide which is next the Mountain, or to that next the Sea? by which one avoids the di&s;a&s;ters that might happen by meeting in the dark. From this Grotto, or high way, we came to the place called <HI>Grotto delcane,</HI> or the Dogs Grotto: It is a little place concaved or hollowed in the &s;ide of a little hill, hard by a Lake, or great pond of water; in which place a man
<PB N="23" REF="15">
may &s;tand upright, and go three or four &s;teps in length and breadth; here we had a Dog brought us, by a man that lives hard by, and that makes it his bu&s;ine&s;s for gain to &s;hew the experiment to &s;trangers; he takes his Dog, and holds down his head within a Foot of the ground, for higher it is believed the Sulphurous Vapours do not mount, as one may ob&s;erve by a kind of green colour that &s;tains the &s;ides of the place, about a foot high from the Surface of the ground, and not higher; and before you can count a hundred, if you count not too fa&s;t, the Dog begins to &s;tagger and reel, (the man then letting him loo&s;e) he &s;oon falls down, and &s;truggling for life, dies away immediately; then the man &s;peedily takes him out, and wa&s;hing him a little in the water of the Lake hard by, he pre&s;ently recovers; we tryed, for our better &s;atisfaction, the experi|ment upon one of our own Dogs,
<PB N="24" REF="16">
and kept him in the &s;aid Grotto it may be half a minute, or &s;ome &s;uch &s;mall matter of time longer than the fir&s;t Dog, but too long to recover him, for all our wa&s;hing, and whatever el&s;e we could do, could not bring him to life again.</P>
<P>About a mile from this venemous Grotto is the burning Mountains called by the name of <HI>Sulpha terra,</HI> the principal matter that burns is Brim&s;tone, mixed with other Mi|nerals: We were as near the burn|ing part of it as we dur&s;t go, for the &s;moke and fire was &s;ometimes rea|dy to choak us. But which was mo&s;t to be admired, was to &s;ee fire and &s;moke come furiou&s;ly out, if you thru&s;t but a &s;tick into that levelled part of the Mountain on which we walked, the hilly part thereof being blown up and con&s;u|med with burning &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>From hence we went to <HI>Puzzeolo,</HI> a little Town near the Sea-&s;ide, where we &s;aw the Academy or
<PB N="25" REF="16">
School of <HI>Virgil:</HI> and by this the Temple of <HI>Neptune:</HI> but there is nothing remaining of either but old Walls, and the ruins thereof. From hence we took a Boat and went by Sea to &s;ee the <HI>Sybillas</HI> Grotto, but by the way they gave us an account of a Mountain we &s;aw hard by, called <HI>Monta Nova,</HI> that about 134 years ago there was a curious Plain where the Mountain now &s;tands, and in it a little Town, whereof the people were grown to that exce&s;s of debauchery and loo&s;ene&s;s of life, that in one nights time they were all covered with this Mountain, which they believe to be the Judg|ment of God upon the wickedne&s;s of the place. Others there are that &s;ay this Mountain was by the vio|lent di&s;order of combu&s;tible matter burning under ground, blown up from <HI>Sulpha terra</HI> before mention|ed, and carried to that place where it now &s;tands, which is two miles or thereabouts. Within half a mile

of this Mountain you &s;ee the Grot|to of <HI>Sybilla,</HI> and the Lake <HI>Aver|nus,</HI> or Lake of Hell; at the far|ther &s;ide of which is the Temple of <HI>Apollo.</HI> About half a mile from the <HI>Grotto Sybilla</HI> are the Hot Baths: and very near to this place we &s;aw the Tomb of <HI>Agripina,</HI> the mother of <HI>Nero;</HI> by which &s;tands the Ruins of the Temple of <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Diana:</HI> And from hence you may &s;ee that place where <HI>Nero</HI> cau&s;ed his Mother to be opened, whereof nothing re|mains but the ruins, like unto a Rock in the Sea, &s;ome four&s;core or a hundred paces from the &s;hore. We had not gone far from the Sea|&s;ide, but going over a little Hill we came into the ruins of what had been formerly a very fine &s;treet, in which was kept the <HI>Saturdays</HI> Mar|ket of that great and antient Town called by the name of <HI>Baiae:</HI> Near the end of which &s;treet, in a Vault or Cave there are &s;everal hollows or niches in the Walls, where for|merly

And not far from hence we &s;aw what &s;ome call <HI>Pi&s;ci|na mirabilis,</HI> which undoubtedly had been built for &s;ome great end. It is a very lofty building under ground, &s;upported by forty huge Pillars of Stone, or thereabouts; the plai&s;tering of the Walls laid on about as thick as a Crown-piece, of &s;o excellent a compo&s;ition, (whereof they &s;ay whites of Eggs, which I refer to the Reader, was part of the Compound) is &s;o very hard, that the Rock it &s;elf cannot be harder. Here it is they &s;ay <HI>Ne|ro</HI> kept fre&s;h water for the u&s;e of his Navy, that lay then in the Dead Sea. From this place we went and &s;aw the <HI>Cento Camarelle,</HI> or little rooms, very &s;trangely contrived to keep Slaves and Pri&s;oners in.</P>

From hence we took our Boat again, and returned to <HI>Puzzeolo,</HI> where one may &s;ee the beginning of a Bridge, carried on at lea&s;t a mile or two into the Sea; it is re|ported to be the unadvi&s;ed enter|pri&s;e of the Emperour <HI>Caligula,</HI> who thought to have made it over an arm of the Sea three or four miles long. The &s;ame night we return|ed to <HI>Naples,</HI> and the next day being <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> we &s;aw the Sepulchres of <HI>Virgil,</HI> and of <HI>Sanazzaro.</HI> Upon <HI>Friday</HI> we took Hor&s;es and went to the burning Mountain of <HI>Ve&s;u|vio,</HI> &s;ome &s;even miles from <HI>Naples</HI> Ea&s;tward. The Heart or Sub&s;tance of the Mountain is con&s;umed by con&s;tant burnings, and frequent Eruptions; &s;o that it may be more properly called the Shell of a Mountain, who&s;e Sub&s;tance is lo&s;t&punc; or not unlike unto a Cup, who&s;e brim or brink, being near half a mile in circumference, one may in any place lean over, and look down

All the way up and down this Mountain, you cannot avoid going up to the Knees in A&s;hes. There is a Bed or Channel that lies dry from the top of the Mountain down to the Sea-&s;ide, which, they &s;ay, was made by a burning liquid mat|ter, which the Mountain &s;pued up &s;o fa&s;t, and with that violence, that it forced its way there, and like an impetuous River run burning down a great way into the Sea, whereof nothing remains now but that Bed or Channel, which has ever &s;ince continued dry: four or five

miles round&punc; this Mountain you &s;ee a hard rocky Cinder, which in Eruptions are thrown &s;o far at lea&s;t, up and down the Country to the great damage of the Inhabi|tants.

<P>Upon <HI>Saturday</HI> we took a view of <HI>Naples</HI> again, and the next morn|ing left that place, in order to our return again to <HI>Rome,</HI> where we arrived the 22<HI>d</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> but took <HI>Fre&s;cata</HI> in our way, which is about 12 miles from <HI>Rome,</HI> where we &s;aw the Palace of <HI>Monte Dra|gone,</HI> and <HI>Aldobrandina,</HI> in the&s;e we &s;aw many fine Waterworks, among which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable was that of the Organs.

went to a Palace of the Counte&s;s of <HI>Smione,</HI> about a mile and a half out of <HI>Millan,</HI> where among&s;t other remarka|ble things, you may take notice of the Echo, which was the be&s;t I ever heard. There is a very &s;trong wall round <HI>Millan,</HI> which is &s;aid to be ten miles; the Libra|ry there is worth &s;eeing.</P>
<P>From this place we came the 13<HI>th</HI> to a little Village called <HI>Buffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">lo</HI> 20 miles, it lies upon <HI>Navillio,</HI> a &s;mall River, and from thence the 14<HI>th</HI> to <HI>Vercelle</HI> 20 miles more: Then we came to the River <HI>Ti&s;&s;i|no</HI> 4 miles, and &s;o to <HI>Novarra</HI> 6 miles; this is the &s;tronge&s;t place upon the Fron|tiers of <HI>Savoy</HI> that belongs to the <HI>Milane|&s;es:</HI> From hence we came to <HI>Vercelli</HI> 10 miles; this place belongs to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and is the fir&s;t place of &s;trength, near the Frontiers of the <HI>Milane&s;es;</HI> One &s;ide of the Town is regularly fortified with Ba&s;tions and Half Moons, hardly fini&s;hed; on the <HI>North</HI> part of the Town the fortifications are irregular, there being a great deal of the old walls &s;till remaining, however the Town is very &s;trong. The 15<HI>th</HI> we came to Din|ner to <HI>Ciliana</HI> or <HI>Sian</HI> 17 miles; and from thence to <HI>Chivas</HI> 10 miles, where we lay that night at the Po&s;thou&s;e, from

The next day, <HI>Sunday,</HI> we went to <HI>Pignerol</HI> 16 miles; it is a &s;trong Town, which the French King about 45 years ago took from the Doke of <HI>Savoy.</HI> The Cit|tadel wherein Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fouket,</HI> thatgreat Mini&s;ter is confined, is a very &s;trong place, and like to be much &s;tronger if they continue to carry on the work of their fortifications. The Town it &s;elf is likewi&s;e very well fortified, where at the Gate going in they obliged us to leave our Arms, and to take a Soldier to wait upon us to the Governour for leave to &s;ee the Town and Cittadel, which was &s;oon granted us. This place has a very great awe upon the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> being able by means thereof at their plea&s;ure to make an in|road upon that Dukedom.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pignerol</HI> we came to <HI>Villiane</HI> the <HI>Monday</HI> following 12 miles, and a bad way over the Mountains; near to this Town we pa&s;&s;ed betwixt two &s;mall Lakes, called by the Name of the Town&punc; From this place we went eight miles farther, and came to <HI>Bu&s;olino,</HI> the next day to <HI>Novale&s;e</HI> &s;ix miles, which is the foot of the Mountains on the &s;ide of
