<HEAD>BELGIA: OR THE <HI>LOW-COUNTRIES.</HI> DESCRIBED.</HEAD>
<P>_THE <HI>Low-Countries</HI> are seated very co|modiously for all the Provinces of <HI>Europe.</HI> For North|ward it is but 5 or 6 dayes journey by Sea from <HI>Den|mark.</HI> Southward it consineth with <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Lorrain.</HI> Eastward with <HI>Almain,</HI> or <HI>Germany.</HI> Westward with <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland.</HI> It's also com|modious for <HI>Norway,</HI> and <HI>Sweden:</HI> for a Ship went from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>Norway</HI> in 46 houres. From <HI>Lisbon</HI> its scarce 10 dayes Voyage.</P>
<P>The circuit of the Country is
<PB N="2" REF="6">
about a Thousand <HI>Italian</HI> Miles, or 34 <HI>Flemish</HI> Leagues. In that part of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> that formerly be|longed to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> are contained 208 walled Towns: An hundred and fifty Towns priviledg|ed, as walled Towns: Six thousand three hundred Villages with Parish Churches, besides a great number of other Villages, and Hamlets.</P>
<P>The Beeves of <HI>Frisland</HI> and <HI>Hol|land,</HI> are very great, and weigh some of them sixteen hundred pounds. Yea, one there was presented to the Earl of <HI>Hockstrait</HI> which weighed two thousand five hundred twenty eight pounds of the Country weight.</P>
<P>The Ewes in <HI>Holland, Frisland,</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders</HI> bring forth 3 or 4 Lambs at a time, and the Kine often two Calves. The Country brings forth much Mather, where|with a great part of <HI>Europe</HI> is furni|shed? Wood, and Hemp, and Flaxin great abundance.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6">Five principal Rivers are in these Countries: The <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Meuse,</HI> the <HI>Scheld, Haa,</HI> and <HI>Emms,</HI> besides divers smaller. The <HI>Muse</HI> affords abundance of Sturgeons, so big, that some of them weigh 400, and some 420 pounds, and are 12 Foot long of <HI>Antwerp</HI> measure.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muse</HI> yeildeth also great store of Salmons, and Salmon Trouts, Lamprayes, Shads, Congers, Mul|lets, and divers other sorts of Fi|shes, which coming into fresh Wa|ter, become fat, and excellent good.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scheld,</HI> by reason of the vi|cinity it hath with the mouth of the <HI>Meuse,</HI> hath divers sorts of Fishes that come out of the Sea, as Stur|geons, Salmons, Salmon Trouts, Lamprayes, Turbots, Congers, Shads, Mullets, Soles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> besides which, such an infinite number of frie come out of the Sea, and are taken in this River, that multitudes of People are relieved therewith.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="7">Besides these Rivers, divers Channels are cut out, and made na|vigable by mans hand, the principal whereof are at <HI>Bruxells, Gant, Bruges,</HI> and <HI>Middlebourg.</HI> The Country hath not many Fountains of running wa|ter, save in the mountainous part: But Lakes, Pools, and Marshes many, which both fortify the Country, and furnish it with Fish.</P>
<P>The Sea ariseth at <HI>Calais</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> in <HI>Zealand,</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> 18 Foot: but where its pressed into a Straight, as at <HI>Bristow,</HI> it rises 66 Foot: At St <HI>Malo,</HI> and <HI>Mount</HI> St. <HI>Michael</HI> in <HI>Normandy</HI> 80 Foot. The depth of the Sea between <HI>Calais</HI> and <HI>Dover</HI> is 24 Fathom (every fathom 6 foot) Be|tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> 23. Be|tween <HI>Wight,</HI> and <HI>Normandy</HI> 28. Near to <HI>Sylly</HI> 60: and so the nearer the Main the deeper.</P>
<P>Herrings come out of the Nor|thern Seas in incredible multitudes into our Seas in <HI>August, September,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="7">
and mid <HI>November:</HI> But the best are taken from mid-<HI>September,</HI> 'till the end of <HI>October.</HI> The sooner the cold begins, the sooner they come, and in the greater number. They once compass our Isle of <HI>Great Bri|tain,</HI> and so pass into the Northern Ocean. Their course is hard by the Shore, and they swim gazing where they see any Light, Fire, or humane Creatures.</P>
<P>They have Kings among them, as Bees have, marked on the Head like a Crown, and are somewhat ruddy, especially upon the Head. The Kings goe before them, and they are followed with an infinite number, which in the Night afar off seem like Lightning, by reason that their eyes are bright like fire. They feed upon water only, and dye as soon as they are taken out.</P>
<P>Many Cods are taken in the same Months with the Herrings; and some of them are above 50 pound weight.
<PB N="6" REF="8">
Of these two kinds of Fishes they yearly make vast summs. Salmons are taken at all times of the year in <HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Zealand.</HI> These 3 kinds of Fish, yeild yearly to them (the Salt deducted) six hundred thousand pound Sterling.</P>
<P>They have divers Forrests, and Woods, well stored with Red and Fallow Deer, Goats, Wild Boars, Hares, Conies, Badgers, Wolves, Foxes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whcth yeild good Furrs.</P>
<P>The Fowl in this Country are Partridge, Feasants, Turtle Doves, Quails, Black-birds, and in briefe, all kinds of Fowl, and Birds that be in <HI>England,</HI> both Water, and Land Fowl, especially water Fowl in <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The People are valiant, and very skilful Seamen: their Hoyes are ex|cellent good to brook the Seas, by reason whereof they dispatch their Voyages sooner than other Nations. They are good Linguists, and very skilful in Merchandise. They excel
<PB N="7" REF="8">
in making Woollen cloth, Tapestry, Fustians, Silks, Velvets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They in|vented the Art of Painting, and the making of Woollen, and Linnen Cloth, and of Dying.</P>
<P>The Women govern all, both within doors, and without, and make all bargains, which makes them too too injurious and troublesom. The eldest Daughter is of the greatest re|putation, yet hath no larger a Porti|on than the rest. They marry Noble with ignoble, young with old, Ma|ster and Servant, into strange Towns, and Forrain Countries.</P>
<P>There are 17 Provinces, <HI>Brabant, Lemburg, Luxenburg, Guilders,</HI> which are Dutchies; <HI>Flanders, Artois, Hey|nalt, Holland, Zealand, Namur,</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> which are Earldoms; The <HI>Marquisat</HI> of the sacred Empire, <HI>Frisland, Malines, Utrecht, Over-Issel,</HI> and <HI>Groningham,</HI> which are Senio|ries. <HI>Lothier</HI> is a bare Title, for the Land remaineth in <HI>Lorrain.</HI></P>

On the contrary, the Ocean first washing the said two Provinces
<PB N="34" REF="22">
for a long tract of ground, and turning then (as it were) from a Sea to a River, it penetrates into each of them by divers Channels, and hides it self there in sundry <HI>Gulphs.</HI> From hence, joyning with the Ri|vers, and together with them cut|ting <HI>Zealand</HI> thorough in many pla|ces, it makes thereof many Islands, and reduces <HI>Holland</HI> into a <HI>Peninsu|la.</HI> And together with these three aforenamed Rivers, which are the chiefest of all <HI>Flanders,</HI> there are in <HI>Holland</HI> divers other lesser ones: And, as if Art would contend with Nature, there are added thereunto an infinite number of Channels cut out by mans hand, which are made for the greater accommodation of the Country.</P>
<P>There are within <HI>Holland</HI> also a great number of Lakes, and standing waters; so as the situation of both these Provinces being well consi|dered, it is to be questioned whe|ther
<PB N="35" REF="22">
the space of ground be greater which by the water is won from the Earth, or from the Water by the Earth. Nor is it less disputable, whe|ther their Country do more abound with, or be more wanting of those commodities which men enjoy in other places. For through the con|dition of their situation they want both Corn, Wine, Oyle, Wool, Wood, Hemp, Flax, and almost all other commodities and delights which are used in more temperate and dry Climates: And yet again, there is no Country, not only in the Northern nook, even not in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which abounds so much as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> in al|most all the forenamed commodi|ties, yea, even of those which are less necessary for the maintenance of humane life: So great is the ad|vantage which these two Provinces receive by the Sea, and Rivers, whereby their commerce with all
<PB N="36" REF="23">
other Countries is made so easie, which since they have introduced, and made so familiar in both the <HI>Indies,</HI> it cannot be said how much both Merchandizes, and Merchants are increased in both of them.</P>
<P>Hence it is that they abound so much with People, and that their Cities, Towns, and Villages are so well inhabited. Yet the Sea like|wise is as full of Ships, and other Bot|toms, and all their watry places with other sorts of Boats, which all of them serve for habitations, espe|cially to Mariners, and Fishers. Great is the number of People that apply themselves to these two Voca|itons in <HI>Holland,</HI> and in <HI>Zealand.</HI> They make houses of their Ships, and of their Houses Schools: Here they are born: Here they are bred up: and here they learn their Professi|ons. And the Marriners especially, who practising their Callings, in running so oft, and so boldly from
<PB N="37" REF="23">
the one Pole to the other, and wheresoever the Sun communicates it self to Mortals, grow so expert therein, as though they may be equalled, yet they cannot be out|done in this Seafairing Mystery, by any Nation whatsoever. In briefe, these People are generally given to Traffique, and are extraordinary in|dustrious in Manual, and Mechanical Arts.</P>
<P>Their greatest delight lyes in their meat, and in their Feasts, by which they temper the melancholly of their tedious Winters, which are rather long than sharp, the Country abounding much more in Rain than in Frosts. They are generally well shaped in Body; and as candid in nature as in countenance: Pleasant in their leasure times; but fierce in their Warrs, and much better in fighting at Sea than by Land: they feed most upon Fish, and are Whit|meats, wherein their Country doth

<P><HI>Holland</HI> is full of Great Cities, good Towns, and infinite in Villa|ges. But by reason of the frequency of Forreigners, and multitudes of Natives, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> hath alwayes been the chiefest City of this Pro|vince.

In <HI>Zealand Middle|bourg</HI> is the Town best peopled, and of greatest Traffick; yet cannot that Province come any thing neer <HI>Hol|land,</HI> neither in circuit, people, nor plenty. Its almost impossible to

enter either of these Provinces by force: Becaus not only the chief places but even the commonest Towns are environed, either by the Sea, Rivers, Lakes, or by Earth, than which there can be none more low, nor more miery: So as it is no wonder if these People, being thus favoured by Nature, were both so sierce in taking up Arms against <HI>Spain</HI> at first, and with the like animosity maintained them till they had pro|cured their own peace. <HI>Bentivog: Hist: of Fland: Pag.</HI> 73.</P>

of them growing greater, as they draw neerer the Ocean, before they fall thereinto, they joyn together in divers spacious <HI>Gulphs;</HI> among which the Islands of <HI>Zealand</HI> are ra|ther buried than raised up; so low are they seated, and so oft doth the Sea do mischief there. This low si|tuation is notwithstanding endea|voured to be remedied by the Inha|bitants with exceeding high, and firm Banks. But this remedie doth not alwayes give them security, of which the Island of <HI>Zuitbevolant</HI> hath had sad experience, it having in former time been one of the grea|test, and best peopled of all the <HI>Zea|land</HI> Islands. In the year 1532, the Sea arose with one of the most ter|rible Tempests that was ever seen in those Parts, and rending the Banks asunder, and bearing down what|soever withstood it, it overflowed from the one side to the other, and did actually drown a great part of

<P><PB N="70" REF="40">Towards the Field side, the City is environed with one of the state|lyest Walls that can be seen, as well for the breadth of the Platform within, as for the Noble Bastions without; and the Ditch is every where answerable. On the other side towards the River, the River it self serves for a defence, and there|fore on that side, there is only a single Wall. The Platform of the Wall to|wards the Fields is of such a breadth as many Rowes of Trees stand round about it, so as it serves no less for delight than for defence.</P>

<P><HI>Aix</HI> is situated between the Dut|chy of <HI>Brabant, Limbourg, Juliers,</HI> and the Bishoprick of <HI>Liege.

<P><HI>Aix</HI> is a goodly City, and the Country about it is very pleasant and fruitful, but the Buildings of the Town do not answer the fame of the Place, saving the hot Baths,

which are very fairly built, and are very wholsome for many Disea|ses.</P>
<P><HI>Aix</HI> is an Imperial City, but pay|eth only a small Tribute to the Em|perour; otherwise it enjoyes free|dome, and hath the Duke of <HI>Cleves</HI> for Protector, next Neighbour and perpetual Confederate.</P>
