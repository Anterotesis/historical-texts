<HEAD>REASONS Again&s;t making the RIVER <HI>DARWENT,</HI> in the County of <HI>Derby,</HI> NAVIGABLE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. THE Mayor and Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>Derby,</HI> have Thrice heretofore attempted, without Succe&s;s, the making this River Navigable.</P>
<P N="2">II. There is no Common Bridge over the &s;aid River, but many Fords, through which Carts and Carriages daily, and Mill-&s;tones frequently do pa&s;s. Now by con&s;tant deepening the Channel to keep the River Navigable, no New Fords can ever be ca&s;t up; and if the Old ones wear out, which often happens, all Communication of the Inhabitants on the one &s;ide of the River, with tho&s;e on the other, will be lo&s;t; for the Undertakers are not willing to make Bridges.</P>
<P N="3">III. On this River are divers Corn-Mills and Fulling-Mills, which this Navigation will often lay dry, and frequently interrupt their Working, to the great damage of the Country thereabouts, and endanger the breaking of the Wares, to the da|mage of the Owners.</P>
<P N="4">IV. This intended Navigation will not, as is pretended, Advance the Trade of any Market, or other Town lying near the &s;aid River, or the River <HI>Trent;</HI> but in&s;tead thereof, it will much abate the Trade of <HI>Nottingham, Mansfield, Blyth, Tuxford, Wor&s;op, Bautry,</HI> &amp;c. which is driven thence through <HI>Scar&s;dale</HI> by Land-Carriage into <HI>York-&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and by this means mul|titudes of Families will be utterly undone, who now get their Living by Land-Carriage.</P>
<P N="5">V. Nor can this intended Navigation be any ways commodious for the quicker and cheaper conveying of Goods to the Port of <HI>London</HI> (which is the principal Rea&s;on that all Navigators urge for &s;uch their Undertaking) for oftentimes the Stream of this River for a Month or &s;ix Weeks together, is &s;o &s;mall and &s;hal|low, that it will &s;carce carry a little Fi&s;hing-Boat; all which time the greater Ve&s;&s;els with their Lading, mu&s;t lie &s;till, and the Trader often lo&s;e the advantage of that Market, which he might have been &s;ure of by Land-Carriage.</P>
<P N="6">VI. And as for the Pre&s;ervation of the High-ways, a Benefit which is pre|tended will be wrought by this Navigation, this Navigation can only &s;ave five Miles of Land-Carriage, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Derby</HI> to <HI>Wiln-Ferry,</HI> and all who are liable to the repair of tho&s;e High-ways, had much rather bear that Charge, than be barr'd the conveniency of pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Darwent</HI> when they have occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="7">VII. If this River were capable of being made Navigable, (as in the opinion of all who know it well, it is not) yet it would be advantageous to none, be&s;ides a few Trade&s;men in <HI>Derby,</HI> but very prejudicial to many who live there, and get a comfortable Livelihood by Land-Carriage from thence to <HI>Wiln-Ferry,</HI> yet dare not, for fear of the Great ones of the Town, &s;hew their di&s;like of the Navigation.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Now by this Navigation, to enrich &s;ome of the Town of <HI>Derby</HI> and impoveri&s;h others, to &s;ubvert the Trade of all the Market-Towns in <HI>Nottingham|&s;hire,</HI> and greatly to annoy all the Gentlemens E&s;tates on the Banks of the River <HI>Darwent,</HI> is ju&s;t as rea&s;onable, as to rob all the Apo&s;tles to enrich St. <HI>Peter.</HI></P>
