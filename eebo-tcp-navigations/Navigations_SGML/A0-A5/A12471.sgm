<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_SIR <HI>Robert Cotton,</HI> that most learned Treasurer of Antiquitie, having by perusall of my Generall Historie, and others, found that I had likewise un|dergone divers other as hard hazards in the other parts of the world, reque|sted me to fix the whole course of my passages in a booke by it selfe, whose noble desire I could not but in part satisfie; the rather, because
<PB REF="4">
they have acted my fatall Tragedies upon the Stage, and rac|ked my Relations at their pleasure. To prevent therefore all future misprisions, I have compiled this true discourse. En|vie hath taxed me to have writ too much, and done too little; but that such should know, how little I esteeme them, I have writ this, more for the satisfaction of my friends, and all gene|rous and well disposed Readers: To speake only of my selfe were intolerable ingratitude; because, having had so many co-partners with me; I cannot make a Monument for my selfe, and leave them unburied in the fields, whose lives be|got me the title of a Souldier; for as they were companions with me in my dangers, so shall they be partakers with me in this Tombe.</P>
<P>For my <HI>Sea Grammar</HI> (caused to bee printed by my wor|thy friend, Sir <HI>Samuel Saltonstall</HI>) hath found such good en|tertainment abroad, that I have beene importuned by many noble persons, to let this also passe the Presse. Many of the most eminent Warriers, and others, what their swords did, their penns writ: Though I bee never so much their inferi|our, yet I hold it no great errour, to follow good examples; nor repine at them, will doe the like.</P>
<P>And now my most Honourable good Lords, I know not to whom I may better present it, than to your Lordships, whose friendships, as I conceive, are as much to each others, as my duty is to you all; and because you are acquainted both with my endevours, and writings, I doubt not, but your honours will as well accept of this, as of the rest, and Patronize it under the shadow of your most noble vertues, which I am ever bound in all duty to reverence, and under which I hope to have shelter, against all stormes that dare threaten.</P>

<P>A Generall rumour of a generall peace, now spred it selfe over all the face of those tormented Countries: but the <HI>Turke</HI> intended no such matter, but levied souldiers from all parts he could.

At his first comming, the <HI>Turkes</HI> sallied upon the <HI>Germane</HI> quar|ter, slew neere five hundred, and returned before they were thought on. The next night in like manner they did neere as much to the <HI>Bemers,</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI>; of which fortune still presuming, thinking to have found the <HI>French</HI> quarter as carelesse, eight or nine hundred of them were cut in pieces and taken prisoners.

At midnight upon the Alarum, it was a fearfull sight to see the short flaming course of their flight in the aire, but presently after their fall, the lamentable noise of the miserable slaughte|red <HI>Turkes</HI> was most wonderfull to heare: Besides, they had fired that Suburbe at the Port of <HI>Buda</HI> in two or three places, which so troubled the <HI>Turkes</HI> to quench, that had there beene any meanes to have assaulted

<P>MAHOMET, the great <HI>Turke,</HI> during the siege, had raised an Ar|mie of sixtie thousand men to have releeved it; but hearing it was lost, he sent <HI>Assan Bashaw</HI> Generall of his Armie, the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Buda, Bashaw Amaro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> to see if it were possible to regaine it; The Duke understanding there could be no great experience in such a new levied Armie as <HI>Assan</HI> had; having put a strong Garrison into it: and with the brave Colonell <HI>Rosworme, Culnits, Meldritch,</HI> the <HI>Rhine-Grave, Vahan</HI> and many others; with twenty thousand good souldiers, set forward to meet the <HI>Turke</HI> in the Plaines of <HI>Girke.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A brave encoun|ter of the <HI>Turkes</HI> Armie with the <HI>Christians.</HI></NOTE> Those two Armies encountred as they marehed, where began a hot and bloudy Skirmish betwixt them, Regiment against Regiment, as they came in order, till the night parted them: Here Earle <HI>Meldritch</HI> was so invironed amongst those halfe circu|ler Regiments of <HI>Turkes,</HI> they supposed him their Prisoner, and his Regi|ment lost; but his two most couragious friends, <HI>Vihan</HI> and <HI>Culnits,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="13">
made such a passage amongst them, that it was a terror to see how horse and man lay sprawling and tumbling, some one way, some another on the ground. The Earle there at that time made his valo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> shine more bright than his armour, which seemed then painted with <HI>Turkish</HI> bloud, he slew the brave <HI>Zanzack Bugola,</HI> and made his passage to his friends, but neere halfe his Regiment was slaine. Captain <HI>Smith</HI> had his horse sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e under him, and himselfe sore wounded; but he was not long unmounted, for there was choice enough of horses, that wanted masters. The <HI>Turke</HI> thinking the victory sure against the Duke, whose Armie, by the Siege and the Garrison, he had left behind him, was much weakned, would not be content with one, but he would have all; and left the Duke should returne to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> he sent that night twenty thousand to besiege the Citie, assuring them he would keepe the Duke or any other from re|leeving them. Two or three dayes they lay each by other, entrenching themselves; the <HI>Turkes</HI> daring the Duke daily to a sett battell, who at length drew out his Army, led by the <HI>Rhine-Grave, Culnits</HI> and <HI>Meldritch,</HI> who upon their first encounter, charged with that resolute and valiant courage, as disordered not only the formost squadrons of the <HI>Turkes,</HI> but enforced all the whole Armie to retire to the Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke <HI>Mercury</HI> overthroweth <HI>Assan Rassa</HI></NOTE> with the losse of five or six thousand, with the <HI>Bashaw</HI> of <HI>Buda,</HI> and foure or five <HI>Zanzacks,</HI> with divers other great Commanders, two hundred Prisoners, and nine pecces of Ordnance. At that instant appeared, as it were, another Ar|mie comming out of a valley over a plaine hill, that caused the Duke at that time to be contented, and to retire to his Trenches; which gave time to <HI>Assan</HI> to reorder his disordered squadrons: Here they lay nine or ten dayes, and more supplies repaired to them, expecting to try the event in a sett battell; but the souldiers on both parties, by reason of their great wants and approach of winter, grew so discontented, that they were ready of themselves to breake up the Leager; the <HI>Bashaw,</HI> retiring him|selfe to <HI>Buda,</HI> had some of the Reare Troopes cut off. <HI>Amaroz Bashaw</HI> hearing of this, found such bad welcome at <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and the Towne so strongly repaired, with so brave a Garrison, raised his siege, and reti|red to <HI>Zigetum.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke understanding that the Arch-duke <HI>Ferdinando</HI> had so reso|lutely besieged <HI>Caniza,</HI> as what by the losse of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> retreat to <HI>Buda,</HI> being void of hope of any reliefe, doubted not but it would become againe the <HI>Christians.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke <HI>Mercury</HI> di|videth his Armie.</NOTE> To the furtherance whereof, the Duke divided his Armie into three parts.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe worthy Lord <HI>Rosworme</HI> had not a worse journey to the mise|rable Seige of <HI>Caniza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The unhappie siege of <HI>Caniza.</HI></NOTE> (where by the extremitie of an extraordi|nary continuing tempest of haile, wind, frost and snow, in so much that the <HI>Christians</HI> were forced to leave their Tents and Artillery, and what they had; it being so cold that three or foure hundred of them were frozen to death in a night, and two or three thousand lost in that miserable flight in the snowie tempest, though they did know no enemie at all to follow them:) than the noble Earle of <HI>Meldritch</HI> had to <HI>Transil|vania,</HI> where hearing of the death of <HI>Michael</HI> and the brave Duke <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> and knowing the policie of <HI>Busca,</HI> and the Prince his Roialtie, being now beyond all beleefe of men, in possession of the best part of <HI>Transil|vania,</HI> perswaded his troopes, in so honest a cause, to assist the Prince against the <HI>Turke,</HI> rather than <HI>Busca</HI> against the Prince.</P>
<P>The souldiers being worne out with those hard payes and travells,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Earle <HI>Meldritch</HI> serveth Prince <HI>Sigismundus.</HI></NOTE> upon hope to have free libertie to make bootie upon what they could get possession of from the <HI>Turkes,</HI> was easily perswaded to follow him whithersoever. Now this noble Earle was a <HI>Transilvanian</HI> borne, and his fathers Countrey yet inhabited by the <HI>Turkes</HI>; for <HI>Transilvania</HI> was yet in three divisions, though the Prince had the hearts both of Country and people; yet the Frontiers had a Garrison amongst the unpassable mountaines, some for the Emperour, some for the Prince, and some for the <HI>Turke:</HI> to regaine which small estate, hee desired leave of the Prince to trie his fortunes, and to make use of that experience, the time of twen|tie yeares had taught him in the Emperours service, promising to spend the rest of his dayes for his countries defence in his Excellencies service. The Prince glad of so brave a Commander, and so many expert and an|cient souldiers, made him Campe-master of his Armie, gave him all ne|cessary releefe for his troopes and what freedome they desired to plun|der the <HI>Turkes.</HI></P>
<P>The Earle having made many incursions into the Land of <HI>Zarkam</HI> a|mong those rockie mountains, where were some <HI>Turks,</HI> some <HI>Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Earle <HI>Meldritch</HI> maketh incursi|ons to discover <HI>Regall.</HI></NOTE> but most <HI>Bandittoes, Rennegadoes,</HI> and such like, which sometimes hee forced into the Plaines of <HI>Regall,</HI> where is a Citie not only of men and fortifica|tions, strong of it selfe, but so environed with mountaines, that made the passages so difficult, that in all these warres no attempt had beene made upon it to any purpose: Having satisfied himselfe with the Situa|tion
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and the most convenient passages to bring his Armie unto it: The earth no sooner put on her greene habit, than the Earle overspread her with his armed troopes. To possesse himselfe first of the most convenient passage, which was a narrow valley betwixt two high mountaines; he sent Colonell <HI>Veltus</HI> with his Regiment, dispersed in companies to lye in <HI>Ambuscado,</HI> as he had directed them, and in the morning to driue all the cattell they could finde before a Fort in that passage, whom he supposed would sally, seeing but some small partie, to recover their prey; which tooke such good successe, that the Garrison was cut off by the <HI>Ambusca|do,</HI> and <HI>Veltus</HI> seized on the Skonces, which was abandoned. <HI>Meldritch</HI> glad of so fortunate a beginning, it was six dayes ere he could with six thousand Pioners make passage for his Ordnance: The <HI>Turkes</HI> having such warning, strengthned the Towne so with men and provision, that they made a scorne of so small a number as <HI>Meldritch</HI> brought with him before the Citie, which was but eight thousand. Before they had pitched their Tents, the <HI>Turkes</HI> sallied in such abundance, as for an houre they had rather a bloudy battell than a skirmish, but with the losse of neere fifteene hundred on both sides.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Moyses</HI> besiegeth <HI>Regall.</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Turkes</HI> were chased till the Cities Ordnance caused the Earle to retire. The next day <HI>Zachel Moyses,</HI> Gene|rall of the Armie, pitched also his tents with nine thousand foot and horse, and six and twenty peeces of Ordnance; but in regard of the situa|tion of this strong Fortresse, they did neither feare them nor hurt them, being upon the point of a faire promontory, environed on the one side within halfe a mile with an un-usefull mountaine, and on the other side with a faire Plaine, where the <HI>Christians</HI> encamped, but so commanded by their Ordnance, they spent neere a month in entrenching themselves, and raising their mounts to plant their batteries; which slow procee|dings the <HI>Turkes</HI> oft derided, that their Ordnance were at pawne, and how they grew fat for want of exercise, and fearing lest they should de|part ere they could assault their Citie, sent this Challenge to any Cap|taine in the Armie.</P>
<P>That to delight the Ladies, who did long to see some court-like pa|stime, the Lord <HI>Turbashaw</HI> did defie any Captaine, that had the com|mand of a Company, who durst combate with him for his head: The matter being discussed, it was accepted, but so many questions grew for the undertaking, it was decided by lots, which fell upon Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> before spoken of.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Three single Combates.</NOTE><MILESTONE N="1"> Truce being made for that time, the Rampiers all beset with faire Dames, and men in Armes, the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Battalio; Turbashaw</HI> with a noise of Howboyes entred the fields well mounted and armed; on his shoulders were fixed a paire of great wings, compacted of Eagles fea|thers within a ridge of silver, richly garnished with gold and precious stones, a <HI>Ianizary</HI> before him, bearing his Lance, on each side another leading his horse; where long hee stayed nor, ere <HI>Smith</HI> with a noise of Trumpets, only a Page bearing his Lance, passing by him with a courte|ous salute, tooke his ground with such good successe, that at the sound of the charge, he passed the <HI>Turke</HI> thorow the sight of his Beaver, face, head and all, that he fell dead to the ground, where alighting and unbra|cing

his Helmet, cut off his head, and the <HI>Turkes</HI> tooke his body; and so returned without any hurt at all. The head hee presented to the Lord <HI>Moses,</HI> the Generall, who kindly accepted it, and with joy to the whole armie he was generally welcomed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="2"> The death of this Captaine so swelled in the heart of one <HI>Grualgo,</HI> his vowed friend, as rather inraged with madnesse than choller, he directed a particular challenge to the Conquerour, to regaine his friends head, or lose his owne, with his horse and Armour for advantage, which accor|ding to his desire, was the next day undertaken: as before upon the sound of the Trumpets, their Lances flew in peeces upon a cleare passage, but the <HI>Turke</HI> was neere unhorsed. Their Pistolls was the next, which mar|ked <HI>Smith</HI> upon the placard; but the next shot the <HI>Turke</HI> was so woun|ded in the left arme, that being not able to rule his horse, and defend himselfe, he was throwne to the ground, and so bruised with the fall, that he lost his head, as his friend before him; with his horse and Armour; but his body and his rich apparell was sent backe to the Towne.</P>
<P>Every day the <HI>Turkes</HI> made some sallies, but few skirmishes would they endure to any purpose. Our workes and approaches being not yet advanced to that height and effect which was of necessitie to be perfor|med; to delude time, <HI>Smith</HI> with so many incontradictible perswading reasons, obtained leave that the Ladies might know he was not so much enamoured of their servants heads, but if any <HI>Turke</HI> of their ranke would come to the place of combate to redeeme them, should have his also up|on the like conditions, if he could winne it.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="3"> The challenge presently was accepted by <HI>Bonny Mulgro.</HI> The next day both the Champions entring the field as before, each discharging their Pistoll, having no Lances, but such martiall weapons as the defen|dant appointed, no hurt was done; their Battle-axes was the next, whose piercing bils made sometime the one, sometime the other to have scarce sense to keepe their saddles, specially the <HI>Christian</HI> received such a blow that he lost his Battle-axe, and failed not much to have fallen after it, wherat the supposing conquering <HI>Turk,</HI> had a great shout from the Ram|piers. The <HI>Turk</HI> prosecuted his advantage to the uttermost of his power; yet the other, what by the readinesse of his horse, and his judgement and dexterity in such a businesse, beyond all mens expectation, by Gods as|sistance, not onely avoided the <HI>Turkes</HI> violence, but having drawne his Faulchion, pierced the <HI>Turke</HI> so under the Culets thorow backe and bo|dy, that although he alighted from his horse, he stood not long ere hee lost his head, as the rest had done.</P>

<P>THis good successe gave such great encouragement to the whole Armie, that with a guard of six thousand, three spare horses, be|fore each a <HI>Turkes</HI> head upon a Lance, he was conducted to the Generalls Pavillion with his Presents. <HI>Moyses</HI> received both him and them with as much respect as the occasion deserved, embracing him in his armes, gave him a faire Horse richly furnished, a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mitere and belt worth three hundred ducats; and <HI>Meldritch</HI> made him Sergeant major of his Regiment.

The Earle remembring his fathers death, battered it with all the Ordnance in the Towne, and the next day tooke it; all he found could beare Armes he put to the sword, and set their heads upon stakes round about the walles, in the same manner they had used the <HI>Christians,</HI> when they tooke it. <HI>Moyses</HI> having repaired the Rampiers, and throwne downe the worke in his Campe, he put in it a strong Garrison, though the pillage he had got|ten in the Towne was much, having beene for a long time an impregna|ble den of theeves; yet the losse of the Armie so intermingled the sowre with the sweet, as forced <HI>Moyses</HI> to seek a further revenge, that he sacked <HI>Veratio, Solmos,</HI> and <HI>Kupronka,</HI> and with two thousand prisoners, most women and children, came to <HI>Esenberg,</HI> not farre from the Princes Pa|lace, where he there Encamped.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>BVsca</HI> having all this time beene raising new forces, was comman|ded from the Emperour againe to invade <HI>Transilvania,</HI> which be|ing one of the fruitfullest and strongest Countries in those parts, was now rather a desart, or the very spectacle of desolation; their fruits and fields overgrowne with weeds, their Churches and battered Palaces and best buildings, as for feare, hid with Mosse and Ivy; being the very Bulwarke and Rampire of a great part of <HI>Europe,</HI> most fit by all Christians to have beene supplyed and maintained, was thus brought to ruine by them it most concerned to support it. But alas, what is it, when the power of Majestie pampered in all delights of pleasant vanity, neither knowing nor considering the labour of the Ploughman, the hazard of the Merchant, the oppression of Statesmen; nor feeling the piercing torme~ts of broken limbes, &amp; inveterated wounds, the toilsome marches, the bad lodging, the hungry diet, and the extreme misery that Souldiers endure to secure all those estates, and yet by the spight of malicious detraction, starves for want of their reward and recompences; whilest the politique Courtier, that co~monly aimes more at his owne honors &amp; ends, than his Countries good, or his Princes glory, honour, or security, as this worthy Prince too well could testifie. But the Emperor being certified how weak and desperate his estate was, sent <HI>Busca</HI> againe with a great Army, to trie his fortune once more in <HI>Transilvania.</HI> The Prince considering how his Country &amp; subjects were consumed, the small means he had any longer to defend his estate, both against the cruelty of the <HI>Turke,</HI> &amp; the power of the Emperor, &amp; the small care the <HI>Polanders</HI> had in supplying him, as they had promised, sent to <HI>Busca</HI> to haue truce, till messengers might be sent to the Emperour for some better agreement, wherewith <HI>Busca</HI> was con|tented. The Ambassadours so prevailed, that the Emperour re-assured vnto them the conditions he had promised the Prince at their confede|racie for the lands in <HI>Silesia,</HI> with 60000. ducats presently in hand, and 50000. ducats yearely as a pension.

<P>The Prince vnderstanding of this so sudden and unexpected acci|dent, onely accompanied with an hundred of his Gentry and Nobility, went into the campe to <HI>Busca,</HI> to let him know, how ignorant he was of his Liestenants errour, that had done it without his direction or know|ledge, freely offering to performe what was concluded by his Ambassa|dours with the Emperour;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sigismundus</HI> yeel|deth his country to E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a.</NOTE> and so causing all his Garrisons to come out of their strong holds, he delivered all to <HI>Busca</HI> for the Emperour, and so went to <HI>Prague,</HI> where he was honourably receiued, and established in his possessions, as his Emperiall Majestie had promised. <HI>Busca</HI> assem|bling all the Nobility, tooke their oaths of allegeance and fidelity, and thus their Prince being gone, <HI>Trasilvania</HI> became againe subject to the Emperour.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The battell of <HI>Rotenton</HI>; a pretty stratagem of fire-workes by <HI>Smith.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ROdoll</HI> not knowing how to draw the enemie to battell, raised his Armie, burning and spoyling all where he came, and returned againe towards <HI>Rebrinke</HI> in the night, as if he had fled vpon the generall rumour of the <HI>Crym-Tartars</HI> comming, which so inflamed the <HI>Turkes</HI> of a happy victory, they vrged <HI>Ieremy</HI> against his will to follow them. <HI>Rodoll</HI> seeing his plot fell out as he desired, so ordered the matter, that having regained the streights, he put his Army in order, that had beene neere two dayes pursued, with continuall skirmishes in his Reare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A battell betwixt <HI>Rodoll</HI> and <HI>Ieremie.</HI></NOTE> which now making head against the enemie, that followed with their whole Armie in the best manner they could, was furiously charged with six thousand <HI>Hydukes, Wallachians,</HI> and <HI>Moldavians,</HI> led by three Co|lonells, <HI>Oversall, Dubras,</HI> and <HI>Calab,</HI> to entertaine the time till the rest came up; <HI>Veltus</HI> and <HI>Nederspolt</HI> with their Regiments, entertained them with the like courage, till the Zanzacke <HI>Hamesbeg,</HI> with six thousand more, came with a fresh charge, which <HI>Meldritch</HI> and <HI>Budendorfe,</HI> rather like enraged lions, than men, so bravely encountred, as if in them only had consisted the victory; <HI>Meldritchs</HI> horse being slaine vnder him, the <HI>Turks</HI> pressed what they could to have taken him prisoner, but being remounted, it was thought with his owne hand he slew the vali|ant Zanzacke, whereupon his troopes retyring, the two proud <HI>Bashawes, Aladin,</HI> and <HI>Zizimmus,</HI> brought up the front of the body of their battell. <HI>Veltus</HI> and <HI>Nederspolt</HI> having breathed, and joyning their troopes with <HI>Becklefield</HI> and <HI>Zarvana,</HI> with such an incredible courage charged the left flancke of <HI>Zizimmus,</HI> as put them all in disorder, where <HI>Zizimmus</HI> the <HI>Bashaw</HI> was taken prisoner, but died presently upon his wounds. <HI>Ieremie</HI> seeing now the maine battell of <HI>Rodoll</HI> advance, being thus constrained, like a valiant Prince in his front of the Vantgard, by his example so braue|ly encouraged his souldiers, that <HI>Rodoll</HI> found no great assurance of the victorie. Thus being joyned in this bloudy massacre, that there was scarce ground to stand upon, but upon the dead carkasses, which in lesse than an hower were so mingled, as if each Regiment had singled out other. The admired <HI>Aladin</HI> that day did leave behinde him a glorious name for his valour, whose death many of his enemies did lament after the victory, which at that instant sell to <HI>Rodoll.</HI> It was reported <HI>Ieremie</HI> was also slaine, but it was not so, but fled with the remainder of his Ar|mie to <HI>Moldavia,</HI> leaving five and twenty thousand dead in the field, of both Armies.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wallachia</HI> subje|cted to the Em|perour.</NOTE> And thus <HI>Rodoll</HI> was seated againe in his Soueraignty, and <HI>Wallachia</HI> became subject to the Emperour.</P>
<P>But long he rested not to settle his new estate, but there came newes, that certaine Regiments of stragling <HI>Tartars,</HI> were forraging those parts towards <HI>Moldavia. Meldritch</HI> with thirteene thousand men was sent against them, but when they heard it was the <HI>Crym-Tartar</HI> and his two

sonnes, with an Armie of thirty thousand; and <HI>Ieremie,</HI> that had escaped with fourteene or fifteene thousand, lay in ambush for them about <HI>Lan|ganaw,</HI> he retired towards <HI>Rottenton,</HI> a strong garrison for <HI>Rodoll</HI>; but they were so invironed with these hellish numbers, they could make no great haste for skirmishing with their scouts, forragers, and small par|ties that still encountred them. But one night amongst the rest, having made a passage through a wood, with an incredible expedition, cutting trees thwart each other to hinder their passage, in a thicke fogge early in the morning, unexpectedly they met two thousand loaded with pillage, and two or three hundred horse and cattell; the most of them were slaine and taken prisoners, who told them where <HI>Ieremie</HI> lay in the pas|sage, expecting the <HI>Crym-Tartar</HI> that was not farre from him. <HI>Meldritch</HI> intending to make his passage perforce, was advised of a pretty strata|gem by the English <HI>Smith,</HI> which presently he thus accomplished; for having accommodated two or three hundred truncks with wilde fire, vpon the heads of lances, and charging the enemie in the night, gave fire to the truncks, which blazed forth such flames and sparkles, that it so amazed not onely their horses, but their foot also; that by the meanes of this fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ming encounter, their owne horses turned tailes with such fu|ry, as by their violence overthrew <HI>Ieremy</HI> &amp; his Army, without any losse at all to speake of to <HI>Meldritch.</HI> But of this victory long they triumphed not; for being within three leagues of <HI>Rottenton,</HI> the <HI>Tartar</HI> with neere forty thousand so beset them, that they must either fight, or be cut in peeces flying. Here <HI>Busca</HI> and the Emperour had their desire; for the Sunne no sooner displayed his beames, than the <HI>Tartar</HI> his colours; where at midday he stayed a while, to see the passage of a tyrannicall and treacherous imposture, till the earth did blush with the bloud of hone|sty, that the Sunne for shame did hide himselfe, from so monstrous sight of a cowardly calamity. It was a most brave sight to see the ban|ners and ensignes streaming in the aire, the glittering of Armour, the variety of colours, the motion of plumes, the forrests of lances, and the thicknesse of shorter weapons, till the silent expedition of the bloudy blast from the murdering Ordnance, whose roaring voice is not so soone heard, as felt by the aymed at object, which made among them a most lamentable slaughter.</P>

<P>IN the valley of <HI>Veristhorne,</HI> betwixt the riuer of <HI>Altus,</HI> and the moun|taine of <HI>Rottenton,</HI> was this bloudy encounter, where the most of the dearest friends of the noble Prince <HI>Sigismundus</HI> perished. <HI>Meldritch</HI> having ordered his eleuen thousand in the best manner he could, at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oot of the mountaine upon his flancks, and before his front, he had pit|ched

sharpe stakes, their heads hardned in the fire, and bent against the enemie, as three battalion of Pikes, amongst the which also there was digged many small holes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The battell of <HI>Rottenton.</HI></NOTE> Amongst those stakes was ranged his foot|men, that upon the charge was to retire, as there was occasion. The <HI>Tartar</HI> having ordered his 40000. for his best advantage, appointed <HI>Mu|stapha Bashaw</HI> to beginne the battell, with a generall shout, all their En|signes displaying, Drummes beating, Trumpets and Howboyes soun|ding. <HI>Nederspolt</HI> and <HI>Mavazo</HI> with their Regiments of horse most vali|antly encountred, and forced them to retire; the <HI>Tartar Begolgi</HI> with his Squadrons, darkening the skies with their flights of numberles arrowes, who was as bravely encountred by <HI>Veltus</HI> and <HI>Oberwin,</HI> which bloudie slaughter continued more than an houre, till the matchlesse multitude of the <HI>Tartars</HI> so increased, that they retired within their Squadrons of stakes, as was directed. The bloudy <HI>Tartar,</HI> as scorning he should st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y so long for the victorie, with his massie troopes prosecuted the charge: but it was a wonder to see how horse and man came to the ground a|mong the stakes, whose disordered troopes were there so mangled, that the <HI>Christians</HI> with a loud shout cryed <HI>Victoria</HI>; and with five or six field peeces, planted vpon the rising of the mountaine, did much hurt to the enemy that still continued the battell with that furie, that <HI>Meldritch</HI> see|ing there was no possibilitie long to preuaile, ioyned his small troopes in one body, resolued directly to make his passage or die in the conclusi|on; and thus in grosse gaue a generall charge, and for more than halfe an houre made his way plaine before him, till the maine battel of the <HI>Crym-Tartar</HI> with two Regiments of <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Ianizaries</HI> so overmatched them, that they were overthrowen. The night approaching, the Earle with some thirteene or foureteene hundred horse, swamme the River, some were drowned, all the rest slaine or taken prisoners: And thus in this bloudy field, neere 30000. lay, some headlesse, armelesse and leg|lesse, all cut and mangled; where breathing their last, they gaue this knowledge to the world, that for the liues of so few, the <HI>Crym-Tartar</HI> ne|uer paid dearer.

<P>NOw you are to understand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The description of the <HI>Crym-Tartars</HI> Court.</NOTE> <HI>Tartary and Scythia</HI> are all one, but so large and spacious, few or none could ever perfectly describe it, nor all the severall kinds of those most barbarous people that inhabit it. Those we call the <HI>Crym-Tartars,</HI> border upon <HI>Moldavia, Podolia, Lituania,</HI> and <HI>Russia,</HI> are much more regular than the interior parts of <HI>Scythia.</HI> This great <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince, that hath so troubled all his neigh|bours, they alwayes call <HI>Chan,</HI> which signifieth Emperour; but we, the <HI>Crym-Tartar.</HI> He liveth for most part in the best champion plaines of many Provinces; and his removing Court is like a great Citie of houses and tents, drawne on Carts, all so orderly placed East and West, on the right and left hand of the Prince his house, which is alwayes in the midst towards the South, before which none may pitch their houses, every one knowing their order and quarter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His houses and carts.</NOTE> as in an Armie. The Princes houses are very artificially wrought, both the foundation, sides, and roofe of wickers, ascending round to the top like a Dove-coat; this they cover with white felt, or white earth tempered with the powder of bones, that it may shine the whiter; sometimes with blacke felt, curi|ously painted with vines, trees, birds, and beasts; the breadth of the Carts are eighteene or twenty foot, but the house stretcheth foure or five foot over each side, and is drawne with ten or twelve, or for more state, twenty Camels and Oxen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Baskets.</NOTE> They have also great baskets, made of smal|ler wickers like great chests, with a covering or the same, all covered over with blacke felt, rubbed over with tallow and sheeps milke, to keepe out the raine; prettily bedecked with painting or feathers; in those they put their houshold stuffe and treasure, drawne upon other carts for that purpose. When they take downe their houses, they set the doore alwayes towards the South, and their carts thirtie or fortie foot distant on each side, East and West, as if they were two walls: the women also have most curious carts; every one of his wives hath a great one for herselfe, and so many other for her attendants, that they seeme as many Courts, as he hath wives. One great <HI>Tartar</HI> or Nobleman, will have for his particular, more than an hundred of those houses and carts, for his severall offices and uses, but set so farre from each other, they will seeme like a great village.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their idolatrie in their lodgings.</NOTE> Having taken their houses from the carts, they place the Master alwayes towards the North; over whose head is alwayes an Image like a Puppet, made of felt, which they call his bro|ther; the women on his left hand, and over the chiefe Mistris her head, such another brother, and betweene them a little one, which is the keeper of the house; at the good wives beds-feet is a kids skinne, stuf|fed with wooll, and neere it a Puppet looking towards the Maids; next the doore another, with a dried cowes udder, for the women that milke the kine, because only the men milke mares; every morning those

<P>WHen he intends any warres,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How he levieth an Armie.</NOTE> he must first have leave of the Great <HI>Turke,</HI> whom hee is bound to assist when hee com|mandeth, receiving daily for himselfe and chiefe of his Nobilitie, pensions from the <HI>Turke,</HI> that holds all Kings but slaves, that pay tribute or are subject to any: signifying his intent to all his sub|jects, within a moneth commonly he raiseth his Armie, and everie man is to furnish himselfe for three moneths victuals, which is parched <HI>Millit,</HI> or grownd to meale, which they ordinarily mingle with water (as is said) hard cheese or cruds dried, and beaten to powder, a little will make much water like milke, and dried flesh, this they put also up in sackes: The <HI>Chan</HI> and his Nobles have some bread and <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and quicke cattell to kill when they please, wherewith verie sparingly they are con|tented. Being provided with expert Guides, and got into the Coun|trey he intends to invade, he sends forth his Scouts to bring in what pri|soners they can, from whom he will wrest the utmost of their knowledge fit for his purpose: having advised with his Councell, what is most fit to be done, the Nobilitie, according to their antiquitie, doth march; then moves he with his whole Armie: if hee finde there is no enemie to oppose him, he adviseth how farre they shall invade, commanding eve|rie man (upon paine of his life) to kill all the obvious Rusticks; but not to hurt any women, or children.</P>
<P>Ten, or fifteene thousand, he commonly placeth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of his warres.</NOTE> where hee findeth most convenient for his standing Campe; the rest of his Armie hee di|vides

But if he understand of an enemie, he will either fight in Ambuscado, or flie; for he will never fight any battell if he can chuse, but upon treble advan|tage; yet by his innumerable flights of arrowes, I have seene flie from his flying troopes, we could not well judge, whether his fighting or flying was most dangerous, so good is h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s horse, and so expert his bow|men; but if they be so intangled they must fight, there is none can bee more hardy, or resolute in their defences.</P>
<P>Regaining his owne borders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How he divides the spoile.</NOTE> he takes the tenth of the principall cap|tives, man, woman, childe, or beast (but his captaines that t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke them, will accept of some particular person they best like for themselves) the rest are divided amongst the whole Armie, according to every mans desert, and quality; that they keepe them, or sell them to who will give most; but they will not forget to use all the meanes they can, to know their estates, friends, and quality, and the better they finde you, the worse they will use you, till you doe agree to pay such a ransome, as they will impose upon you; therefore many great persons have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndured much misery to conceale themselves, because their ransomes areso into|lerable: their best hope is of some <HI>Christian</HI> Agent, that many times com|meth to redeeme slaves, either with mony, or man for man; those Agents knowing so well the extreme covetousnesse of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> doe use to bribe some Iew or Merchant, that feigning they will sell them againe to some other nation, are oft redeemed for a very small ran|some.</P>

foure or five, as well for service, as for to eat; which makes their Armies seem thrice so many as there are souldiers.

<ARGUMENT>
<P> The continuation of the generall Historie of <HI>Virginia</HI>; the <HI>Sum|mer Iles</HI>; and <HI>New England</HI>; with their present estate from 1624. to this present 1629.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>COncerning these Countreyes, I would be sorrie to trouble you with repeating one thing twice, as with their Maps, Commodi|ties, People, Government &amp; Religion yet knowen, the beginning of those plantations, their numbers and names, with the names of the Adventurers, the yeerely proceedings of everie Governour both here and there. As for them misprisions, neglect, grievances, and the causes of all those rumours, losses and crosses that have happened; I referre you to the Generall Historie, where you shall finde all this at large; espe|cially to those pages, where you may read my letter of advice to the Councell and Company, what of necessitie must be done, or lose all and leave the Countrey, pag. 70. what commodities I sent home, pag. 163. my opinion and offer to the Company, to feed and defend the Colonies, pag. 150. my account to them here of my actions there, pag. 163. my seven answers to his Majesties Commissioners: seven questions what hath hindered <HI>Virginia,</HI> and the remedie, pag. 165. How those noble Gentlemen spent neere two yeares in perusing all letters came from thence; and the differences betwixt many factions, both here and there, with their complaints; especially about the Sallerie, which should have beene a new office in <HI>London,</HI> for the well ordering the sale of <HI>To|bacco,</HI> that 2500. pounds should yearely have beene raised out of it, to pay foure or five hundred pounds yearly to the Governor of that Com|panie; two or three hundred to his Deputie; the rest into stipends of thirtie or fiftie pounds yearely for their Clerks and under Officers which were never there, pag. 153. but not one hundred pounds for all them in <HI>Virginia,</HI> nor any thing for the most part of the Adventurers in <HI>England,</HI> except the undertakers for the Lotteries, Setters out of ships, Adven|turers of commodities, also their Factors and many other Officers, there imployed only by friendship to raise their fortunes out of the la|bours of the true industrious planters by the title of their office, who
<PB N="42" REF="30">
under the colour of sinceritie, did pillage and deceive all the rest most cunningly: For more than 150000. pounds have beene spent out of the common stocke, besides many thousands have beene there consu|med, and neere 7000. people that there died, only for want of good or|der and government, otherwise long ere this there would have beene more than 20000. people, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re after twentie yeeres spent onely in complement, and trying new conclusions, was remaining scarce 1500. with some few cattell.</P>
<P>Then the Company dissolved, but no account of any thing; so that his Majestie appointed Commissioners to oversee, and give order for their proceedings. Being thus in a manner left to themselves, since then within these foure yeeres, you shall see how wonderfully they have increased beyond expectation; but so exactly as I desired, I cannot re|late unto you: For although I have tired my selfe in seeking and dis|coursing with those returned thence, more than would a voyage to <HI>Vir|ginia</HI>; few can tell me any thing, but of that place or places they have in|habited, and he is a great traveller that hath gone up &amp; downe the river of <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, been at <HI>Pamaunke, Smiths</HI> Iles, or <HI>Accomack</HI>; wherein for the most part they keepe one tune of their now particular abundance, and their former wants, having beene there, some sixteene yeeres, some twelve, some six, some neere twentie, &amp;c. But of their generall estate, or any thing of worth, the most of them doth know verie little to any purpose.</P>
<P>Now the most I could understand in generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their estate 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">27.</NOTE> was from the relation of M^r. <HI>Nathaniel Cawsey,</HI> that lived there with mee, and returned <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1627. and some others affirme; Sir <HI>George Yerley</HI> was Governour, Captaine <HI>Francis West,</HI> Doctor <HI>Iohn Poot,</HI> Captain <HI>Roger Smith,</HI> Captaine <HI>Matthewes,</HI> Captaine <HI>Tucker,</HI> M^r. <HI>Clabourne,</HI> and M^r. <HI>Farrer</HI> of the Coun|cell: their habitations many. The Governour, with two or three of the Councell, are for most part at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, the rest repaire thither as there is occasion; but everie three moneths they have a generall mee|ting, to consider of their publike affaires.</P>
<P>Their numbers then were about 1500.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their numbers.</NOTE> some say rather 2000. divided into seventeene or eighteene severall Plantations; the greatest part thereof towards the falls, are so inclosed with Pallizadoes they regard not the Salvages; and amongst those Plantations above <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, they have now found meanes to take plentie of fish, as well with lines, as nets, and where the waters are the largest, having meanes, they need not want.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their condition with the Salva|ges.</NOTE></P>
<P>Upon this River they seldome see any Salvages, but in the woods, many times their fires: yet some few there are, that upon their oppor|tunitie have slaine some few stragglers, which have beene revenged with the death of so many of themselves; but no other attempt hath beene made upon them this two or three yeares.</P>
<P>Their Cattle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their increase of Cattle and Poul|trie.</NOTE> namely Oxen, Kine, Buls, they imagine to be about 2000. Goats great store and great increase; the wilde Hogs, which were in|finite, are destroyed and eaten by the Salvages: but no family is so poore, that hath not tame Swine sufficient; and for Poultrie, he is a verie
<PB N="43" REF="30">
bad husband breedeth not an hundred in a yeere, and the richer sort doth daily feed on them.</P>
<P>For bread they have plentie, and so good,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plenty of Corne.</NOTE> that those that make it well, better cannot be: divers have much English corne, especially M^r. <HI>Abraham Perce,</HI> which prepared this yeere to sow two hundred acres of English wheat, and as much with barley, feeding daily about the num|ber of sixtie persons at his owne charges.</P>
<P>For drinke, some malt the Indian corne, others barley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their drinke.</NOTE> of which they make good Ale, both strong and small, and such plentie thereof, few of the upper Planters drinke any water: but the better sort are well furni|shed with Sacke, <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and good English Beere.</P>
<P>Their servants commonly feed upon Milke Homini,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their servants diet.</NOTE> which is bruized Indian corne pounded, and boiled thicke, and milke for the sauce; but boiled with milke, the best of all will oft feed on it, and leave their fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh; with milke, butter and cheese; with fish, Bulls flesh, for they seldome kill any other, &amp;c. And everie one is so applyed to his labour about Tobacco and Corne, which doth yeeld them them such profit, they never re|gard any food from the Salvages, nor have they any trade or conference with them, but upon meere accidents and defiances: and now the Mer|chants have left it, there have gone so many voluntarie ships within this two yeeres, as have furnished them with Apparell, Sacke, <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> and all necessaries, much better than ever before.</P>
<P>For Armes, there is scarce any man but he is furnished with a Peece,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Armes and exercise.</NOTE> a Iacke, a Coat of Maile, a Sword, or Rapier; and euerie Holy-day, e|verie Plantation doth exercise their men in Armes, by which meanes, hunting and fowling, the most part of them are most excellent mark|men.</P>
<P>For Discoveries they have made none,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their health and discoveries.</NOTE> nor any other commoditie than Tobacco doe they apply themselves unto, though never any was planted at first. And whereas the Countrey was heretofore held most intemperate and contagious by many, now they have houses, lodgings and victuall, and the Sunne hath power to exhale up the moyst vapours of the earth, where they have cut downe the wood, which before it could not, being covered with spreading tops of high trees; they finde it much more healthfull than before; nor for their numbers, few Coun|treyes are lesse troubled with death, sicknesse, or any other disease, nor where overgrowne women become more fruitfull.</P>
<P>Since this, Sir <HI>George Yerley</HI> died 1628. Captaine <HI>West</HI> succeeded him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The present e|state of <HI>Virginia,</HI> 1629.</NOTE> but about a yeere after returned for <HI>England</HI>: Now Doctor <HI>Poot</HI> is Go|vernour, and the rest of the Councell as before: <HI>Iames</HI> Towne is yet their chiefe seat, most of the wood destroyed, little corne there planted, but all converted into pasture and gardens, wherein doth grow all man|ner of herbs and roots we have in <HI>England</HI> in abundance, and as good grasse as can be.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>FRom the <HI>Summer Iles,</HI> Master <HI>Ireland,</HI> and divers others report, their Forts, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dnance, and proceedings, are much as they were in the yeare 1622. as you may read in the generall History, page 199. Captaine <HI>Woodhouse</HI> governour. There are few sorts of any fruits in the <HI>West Indies,</HI> but they grow there in abundance; yet the fertility of the soile in many places decayeth, being planted every yeare; for their Plantaines, which is a most delicate fruit, they have lately found a way, by pickling, or drying them, to bring them over into <HI>England,</HI> there be|inq no such fruit in <HI>Europe,</HI> &amp; wonderfull for increase. For fish, flesh, figs, wine, and all sorts of most excellent hearbs, fruits, and rootes they have in abundance. In this Governours time, a kinde of <HI>Whale,</HI> or rather a <HI>Iubarta,</HI> was driven on shore in <HI>Southampton</HI> tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">be from the west, over an infinite number of rocks, so bruised, that the water in the Bay where she lay; was all oily, and the rocks about it all bedasht with Parmacitty, congealed like ice, a good quantity we gathered, with which we com|monly cured any byle, hurt, or bruise; some burnt it in their lamps, which blowing out, the very snuffe will burne, so long as there is any of the oile remaining, for two or three dayes together.</P>
<P>The next Governour, was Captaine <HI>Philip Bell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The present estate of the <HI>Summer Iler.</HI> 1629.</NOTE> whose time being ex|pired, Captaine <HI>Roger Wodd</HI> possessed his place, a worthy Gentleman of good desert, and hath lived a long time in the Country; their numbers are about two or three thousand, men, women, and children, who increase there exceedingly; their greatest complaint, is want of apparell, and too much custome, and too many officers; the pity is, there, are more men than women, yet no great mischiefe, because there is so much lesse pride: the cattell they have increase exceedingly; their forts are well maintained by the Merchants here, and Planters there; to be briefe, this Ile is an excellent bit, to rule great horse.</P>
<P>All the Cohow birds and Egbirds are gone; seldome any wilde cats seene; no Rats to speake of; but the wormes are yet very troublesome; the people very healthfull; and the Ravens gone; fish enough, but not so neere, the shore as it used, by the much beating it; it is an Ile that hath such a rampire and a ditch, and for the quantity so manned, victu|alled, and fortified, as few in the world doe exceed it, or is like it.</P>
<P>The 22. of March, two ships came from thence;<NOTE PLACE="marg">An evill mis|chance.</NOTE> the <HI>Peter-Bonaven|ture,</HI> neere two hundred tunnes, and sixteene peeces of Ordnance; the Captaine, <HI>Thomas Sherwin</HI>; The Master, Master <HI>Edward Some,</HI> like him in condition, a goodly, lusty, proper valiant man: the <HI>Lydia,</HI> wherein was Master <HI>Anthony Thorne,</HI> a smaller ship; were chased by eleuen ships of <HI>Dunkerk</HI>; being thus overmatched, Captaine <HI>Sherwin</HI> was taken by them in <HI>Turbay,</HI> only his valiant Master was slaine; the ship with about

<P>These noble adventurers for all those losses, patiently doe beare them; but they hope the King and state will understand it is worth keep|ing, though it afford nothing but Tobacco, and that now worth little or nothing, custome and fraught payed, yet it is worth keeping, and not supplanting; though great men feele not those losses, yet Gardi|ners, Carpenters, and Smiths doe pay for it.</P>

<P>The businesse thus remaining in this sort, three private men left of that Company, named M^r <HI>Thomas Warriner, Iohn Rhodes,</HI> and <HI>Robert Bims,</HI> having lived there about two yeares, came for <HI>England,</HI> and to be free from the disorders that did grow in the <HI>Amazons</HI> for want of Go|vernment amongst their Countrey-men, and to be quiet amongst them|selves, made meanes to set themselves out for St. <HI>Christophers</HI>; their whole number being but fifteene persons, that payed for their passage in a ship going for <HI>Virginia,</HI> where they remained a yeare before they were supplyed, and then that was but foure or five men.

Those titles of Sea-men and Souldiers, have beene most worthily honoured and esteemed, but now regarded for most part, but as the scumme of the world; regaine therefore your wonted reputations, and endevour rather to adventure to those faire plantations of our <HI>English</HI> Nation; which how|ever in the beginning were scorned and contemned, yet now you see how many rich and gallant people come from thence, who went thither as poore as any Souldier or Sailer, and gets more in one yeare, than you by Piracie in seven. I intreat you therefore to consider, how many thousands yearely goe thither; also how many Ships and Sailers are imployed to transport them, and what custome they yearely pay to our most Royall King <HI>Charles,</HI> whose prosperity and his King|domes good, I humbly beseech the im|mortall God ever to preserve and increase.</P>
