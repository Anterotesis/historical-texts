<P>'TIS well known, that Ireland was conquer'd at fir&s;t by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and bad been all along un|der the ea&s;ie Yoke of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> till <HI>James</HI> II. a&s;cended the Throne. But he, by a Policy, contrary to all the World, de&s;igning to &s;ubdue <HI>Eng|land</HI> to Popery and <HI>French</HI> Government, endeavour'd all he could to have made <HI>Ireland</HI> in her Turn the In&s;trument of that prepo&s;terous Conque&s;t. To which purpo&s;e, he made u&s;e of the general Inclination of that People to the Romi&s;h Religion, &s;ent for whole Regiments of that Nation into <HI>England,</HI> bred 'em up both for. Officers and Souldiers, with no le&s;s Care than the Turks do their <HI>Janizaries;</HI> and when he had fill'd all {iIre|land} with expert Warriors, deliver'd up the whole Power of the Government into the hands of the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholicks; &s;o that all that part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchy was only tackt to <HI>England,</HI> by the &s;ingle Thread of Papi&s;tical Obedience, during a Catholick Reign. After which, King <HI>James</HI> him&s;elf, ha|ving abdicated <HI>England,</HI> headed a general Revolt of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> from the Imperial Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> which had only left &s;ubordinate to it the City of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and one Corner of <HI>Ul&s;ter.</HI> So that &s;o fair a Portion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominion, &s;o Convenient for &s;pacious <HI>Harbors,</HI> &s;o fertile for the Soil, &s;o abounding in all Things for the &s;upport of humane Life, and &s;o particularly famous for admitting no venomous Crea|tures to live in it, but only Prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, was either to be quite lo&s;t, or quite to be re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">conquer'd.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Therefore while the late King <HI>James,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted with <HI>French</HI> Succours, commanded all things, and had &s;et the forfeited Crown of <HI>Irleand</HI> upon his <HI>Head,</HI> Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> was by King <HI>William</HI> &s;ent to &s;top the Career of the abdicated Prince, and his abominated Crew of <HI>Gallick</HI> Foreigners.

<HEAD>AN EXACT JOURNAL OF THE Victorious Progre&s;s of Their <HI>Maje&s;ties Forces</HI> this <HI>Summer</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty, King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> III. by the pro|&s;perous Succe&s;s of his Arms at the <HI>Boyn</HI> the la&s;t Year, was in a very &s;hort time become Ma&s;ter of the greate&s;t patt of <HI>Ireland;</HI> and had driven the late King <HI>James</HI> quite out of the Kingdom; but the Sea&s;on of the Year, and the exce&s;&s;ive Rains, &s;o frequent in that Country, would not permit him any farther Action. For which rea&s;on, after he had given order for his Forces to take up their Winter-Quarters in &s;uch a Manner, as to &s;hut up the Rebels within the mo&s;t narrow limits that might be, and prevent their Incur&s;ions into the regain'd Countries, His Maje&s;ty returned for <HI>England;</HI> leaving to Com|mand the Army and compleat his Conque&s;ts, General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Experience, Fidelity, Conduct and Expedi|tion; as will appear by the en&s;uing Journal. So that if Story receive its lu&s;tre from the Grandeur of the Actions which it re|lates, perhaps this Journal may be thought as con&s;iderable as has for many years come forth; as well for the Courage of the Souldiers, the Difficulty and Succe&s;s of their Euterprizes, and the Importance of their Conque&s;ts.
<PB N="2" REF="4">During the <HI>Winter,</HI> Both &s;ides lay quiet, but the very Ap|proach of Spring warm'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to Action, which tho' not &s;o con&s;iderable, yet was preparatory to facilitate the Opening of the grand Campaign, which did not begin till &s;ometime after. For upon the <HI>14th.</HI> of <HI>March</HI> (where this Journal begins) Colo|nel <HI>Lillington,</HI> between eight and nine at Night, march'd from <HI>Ro&s;creagh,</HI> with a Party of his own, which being joyn'd by ano|ther from <HI>Bix,</HI> made up together Three Hundred Hor&s;e, Foot and Dragoons, and advanc'd toward <HI>Nagah;</HI> but finding the way to be longer then he expected, and day coming on, he de|tach'd Eighteen Hor&s;e and as many Foot, which he mounted upon <HI>Garrans,</HI> and made all the ha&s;te he could to &s;ecure the Bridge about half a Mile from <HI>Nenagh.</HI> Upon which the whole Garri&s;on &s;allied out, to oppo&s;e him: However with that &s;mall party he maintain'd the Pa&s;s, till his Foot came up; and then leaving them at the Bridge, he advanc'd with his Hor&s;e toward the Enemy, who at a di&s;tance were very free of their Shot, but &s;o &s;oon as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came nere them, began to run: upon which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pur&s;u'd them, and kill'd about Twenty, of which number was a Lieutenant, and took one Cornet. This done, the Colonel &s;ent a Detachment to &s;ecure the Pa&s;s on the other &s;ide of <HI>Nenagh,</HI> towards <HI>Limerick,</HI> while the re&s;t of his Men entered the Town (the Rebels flying into the Ca&s;tle) and burnt all the Hou&s;es, together with a great Quantity of Malt and Mcal, and brought away three hundred Head of black Cat|tel, with the Lo&s;s but of two Men &s;lain out-right, and another wounded; but of the Rebels were kill'd between forty and fifty.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time News came from <HI>Cork,</HI> that upon advice that a Party of the Rebels were come before <HI>Ballimagoolis,</HI> a fron|tier Garri&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in that County, a Party was &s;ent from <HI>Cork</HI> to relieve it, of which the Enemy being inform'd, they drew off in great di&s;order; whereupon the Garri&s;on &s;allied out, kill['d &s;everal of the Enemy, and took &s;ever Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Upon the 15th of <HI>March</HI> a detach'd Party or 150 Dragoons, 100 Militia-Hor&s;e, and 130 Foot, marched from <HI>Cork</HI> under the Command of Major <HI>Culliford,</HI> toward <HI>Ballyclongh,</HI> where the Rebels were about to have entrench'd them&s;elves; but upon the appearing of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they quitted their Works, and fled with that ha&s;te, that all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could do in the pur&s;uit was,
<PB N="3" REF="4">to take &s;even Pri&s;oners, of which four were Officers. With better &s;ucce&s;s a Party of Sir <HI>David Collier</HI>'s Regiment, quartered about <HI>Bandon,</HI> together with &s;ome of the <HI>Militia</HI> of that Place, 300 in all, Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>George Hamilton,</HI> mar|ched at the &s;ame time into the Enemies Quarters about <HI>Bantry,</HI> where they killed above &s;eventy of the Rebels, took fifteen Pri&s;o|ners, &s;ix hundred Head of Black Cattel, and a good number of Hor&s;es, without the lo&s;s of one Man.</P>
<P>Of this Action, &s;oon after there came a more full account: That upon notice that Brigadier <HI>Caroll</HI> had a de&s;ign to &s;end five Companies of Foot, with &s;ome Ammunition, to joyn Collonel <HI>O Donavan,</HI> in order to maintain <HI>Bantry,</HI> and put the Country under Contribution; Lieut. Coll. <HI>Hamilton</HI> marched on the 15th of <HI>March,</HI> with 200 Foot of Sir <HI>David Colliers</HI> Regiment, 60 Hor&s;e commanded by Lieut. Coll. <HI>Ogilby,</HI> and 80 of the Militia, and the next day about two in the Afternoon, came in &s;ight of <HI>Bantry;</HI> but finding that the Enemy had quitted the Place the &s;ame Morning, followed them with all the expedition he could. Whereupon the Enemy, perceiving them&s;elves &s;o clo&s;ely pur|&s;ued, left all their Cattel behind, and betook them&s;elves into the Bogs; however the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> followed 'em four Miles, kill'd about 40, took 14 Pri&s;oners, Coll. <HI>Courcy</HI> narrowly e&s;caping, and brought off 1500 Head of Black Cattel, leaving &s;everal thou&s;ands be|hind, for want of People to drive 'em, That night the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tay'd at <HI>Bantry;</HI> and the next day, after they had burnt the Town, returned back. In their way, the Enemy had laid 600 Men in Ambu&s;h, about &s;ix Miles from <HI>Bantry;</HI> but being di&s;co|vered by the Vantcurriers of the Party, after one Volly they ran away to their Hills and Bogs, whither the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> could not pur|&s;uc them</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 25. Thirty of the Militia-Dragoons, commanded by Lieutenant <HI>Powel,</HI> were ordered to fetch up &s;everal Per&s;ons out of the County of <HI>Meath,</HI> who were &s;u&s;pected to have been concer|ned in the Murther of Coll. <HI>Foulks</HI>'s Souldiers; but in his re|turn, he had notice that a Party of Rapparees way-laid him not far from <HI>Hackets</HI>-Town, with a Re&s;olution to re&s;cue the Pri&s;oners: Upon which, he &s;ent away &s;eventeen of his Dragoons with the Pri&s;oners, and with the other thirteen marched to <HI>Hackets</HI>-Town; where &s;ending for the Con&s;table, after &s;ome hard threat|ning
<PB N="4" REF="5">Words, the Con&s;table inform'd him where the Rapparees lay; and then he immediately march'd to find 'em out. So &s;oon as he approached the Place, he advanced with four of his Men into a Field adjoyning, where he fell in with a Party of twenty eight <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> commanded by Captain <HI>O Neale.</HI> The Enemy &s;eeing &s;o &s;mall a number, came up and fired at 'em, but without doing any hurt to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who an&s;wer'd them in the &s;ame Element to better purpo&s;e, killing two of the Rebels, and wounding <HI>O Neale</HI> him&s;elf. By which time, the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being come in, charged the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and kill'd four of them, put the re&s;t to flight, and pur&s;ued them from place to place, till they had killed about twenty of them, and among the re&s;t their Captain <HI>O Neale;</HI> who be|ing wounded before, was now perfectly cured; his Enemies becom|ing his Surgeons. Of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> only three were wounded, and two Hor&s;es kill'd.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 27. Captain <HI>Mark Baggot,</HI> who came as a Spy from <HI>Limerick,</HI> and was taken in Womens Apparel, was try'd, and &s;en|tenc'd by a Court-Martial; but his Execution was re&s;pited, upon his offering to make &s;ome di&s;covery. However, it appear|ing afterwards that he did but dally with Ju&s;tice, and that all his pretended Di&s;coveries were of no moment, he was hang'd out|right upon the Twentieth of <HI>May</HI> following. At the conclu&s;ion of this Month, a Proclamation was publi&s;hed in <HI>Dublin,</HI> bearing Date <HI>March</HI> 26. purporting,</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">That notwith&s;tanding the great Clemency extended by their Maje&s;ties to the Popi&s;h, <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> whereby upon their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they have had equal protection with their Prote&s;tant Subjects, yet &s;uch was the inveterate Malice of many, that upon all occa|&s;ions they not only relieved their Maje&s;ties Enemies, but joyn|ed with them in committing and concealing many horrid Mur|thers, one of which of eight Souldiers inhumanly &s;trangled at one time, and in one place, was lately di&s;covered, to have been per|petrated by the Inhabitants of the Place where the Souldiers were quartered, for which &s;ome of the Criminals had receiv'd ju&s;t Puni&s;hment: And the Lords Ju&s;tices-being fully &s;atisfied that &s;uch Offences could not be committed without the help or con|nivance of the Protected Inhabitants; and having received In|formation that there was a Confederacy among them to relieve their Maje&s;ties Enemies, and to take all Opportunities to de&s;troy
<PB N="5" REF="5">their Officers and Souldiers; their Lord&s;hips therefore declar'd, That if any &s;uch Murthers be hereafter committed, and the Inhabitants do not u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to apprehend the Malefactors, that they &s;hall be put out of their Maje&s;ties protection, and be proceeded again&s;t as Spies and Enemies, accor|ding to the cour&s;e of War.</Q></P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 2.

<P><HI>April</HI> 5. A &s;mall Party of Dragoons, commanded by Quar|ter-Ma&s;ter <HI>Topham,</HI> met with a detach'd Party of the Rebels, under the Command of Captain <HI>Bourke;</HI> of which they &s;lew five, and an En&s;ign, the re&s;t betaking them&s;elves to their heels.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="6">nine Pri&s;oners, &s;even of which being found to be <HI>Rapparees,</HI> were immediately hang'd.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 7. Fifteen hundred of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army came before <HI>Ini&s;h|keam,</HI> and attackt the Garri&s;on of that Place, con&s;i&s;ting of no more than forty four Men, commanded by En&s;ign <HI>Lind&s;ay</HI> and En&s;ign <HI>Dalyel;</HI> but notwith&s;tanding &s;o great a multitude of the Rebels, a part of that &s;mall Garri&s;on defended the two Avenues to the Town above two Hours, till &s;ome of the Popi&s;h Inhabi|tants treacherou&s;ly gave the Enemy entrance into the Town through a by-way, and then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> retreated to the main Guard, which they maintain'd &s;ix Hours longer, at what time the Rebels &s;ummoned the Defendants to &s;urrender; and upon their refu&s;al, had brought together &s;everal Hundreds of Faggots to fire the Guard-Hou&s;e; when in the very nick of Opportnnity, Collonel <HI>Ogilby,</HI> with a Party of Hor&s;e and Foot, came to their Relief; upon who&s;e approach, the Enemy drew off in confu&s;ion; which the Garri&s;on perceiving, &s;allied out upon the Rebels, and kill'd about fifty, with no more than the lo&s;s of one Man.</P>
<P><HI>April</HI> 9. Some of Captain <HI>Green</HI>'s Militia-Dragoons, marching into the Enemies Quarters, kill'd &s;everal of the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> and laid in A&s;hes a Village that gave them harbor. The &s;ame day al&s;o a Court-Martial was held, where Brigadier <HI>Stewart</HI> pre&s;ided, and where &s;everal Per&s;ons, who upon their Tryals appear'd to be Spies, and &s;uch as had a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;heltered the <HI>Rapparees,</HI> were &s;entenced to be hanged.</P>

<P><HI>April</HI> 18.

<P>But this Lo&s;s was reveng'd the &s;ame day with advantage; for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> being inform'd, that a con&s;iderable number of the Rebels were come near to <HI>Macromp,</HI> one of their Maje&s;ties Fron|tier Garri&s;ons, a Party of eighty Hor&s;e and an nundred and fifty Dragoons, of the Army, and as many of the Militia, was drawn out under the Command of Major <HI>Kirk.</HI> This Party marched the 19th in the Evening, and by break of day the next Morning came up with the Rebels, who pre&s;ently took to their Sanctua|ries in the Woods and Bogs, whither the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pur&s;u'd them; and after a chace of &s;ome hours kill'd twenty, took five Pri&s;oners, and brought off &s;ome Hor&s;es and Cattel. Much about the &s;ame time the <HI>Rapparees</HI> coming with a &s;trong Party to <HI>Curragla&s;s</HI> near <HI>Tallough,</HI> had &s;tollen &s;ome Hor&s;es belonging to Collonel <HI>Denopp</HI>'s Regiment, and &s;urpriz'd four Troops.

<P><HI>April</HI> 30.

However, this was not &s;o privately carried, but that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> had notice of it, and thereupon drew out a hun|dred and twenty of their be&s;t Hor&s;e, and as many Dragoons, with two hundred and fifty Voluntiers and <HI>Rapparees,</HI> commanded by Brigadier <HI>Caroll,</HI> Sir <HI>James Cotter,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> Collo|nel <HI>La&s;ly,</HI> Major <HI>Slingsby,</HI> Captain <HI>Coppinger</HI> and Captain <HI>Comb|don,</HI> who fell upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ju&s;t on the other &s;ide of <HI>Six-mile|water,</HI> about three of the Clock in the Morning.

Whereupon the advanced Party of the Enemy, belie|ving the day their own, boldly made up to the Pound, and of|fered the Captain and his Man Quarter; which he refu&s;ing, they began a brisk Charge, and pre&s;&s;ed hard upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by whom the Rebels were &s;o warmly received, that &s;everal of their Number were &s;lain, and carried off, during the heat of the Acti|on: However, they made a &s;econd and a third Attack, though with the &s;ame ill &s;ucce&s;s.

<P><HI>May</HI> 4. Major <HI>Wood</HI> marched from <HI>Mountmilock</HI> to <HI>Ca&s;tle-Cuff,</HI> with a Party of three hundred Foot, drawn out of Collo|nel <HI>Lloyd</HI>'s and the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI>'s Regiment, and fifty Hor&s;e of Collonel <HI>Byerly</HI>'s. In his march, he divided the Foot in|to &s;everal &s;mall Parties, in order to &s;urprize the <HI>Rapparees</HI> in the woods and Bogs, keeping with the Hor&s;e along the skirts of the Bog, to hinder their e&s;cape: By which means, they made a &s;hift to kill about &s;eventy <HI>Rapparees,</HI> and to take a good num|ber of their Cattel. Which done, Major <HI>Wood</HI> advanc'd with thirty Foot, and thirty four Hor&s;e, beyond the <HI>Togher</HI> of <HI>Mal|lybone,</HI> and from thence &s;ent the Cattel homeward under a Guard of thirty Men, and was returning to his Party with tho&s;e few that were with him, about ten of the Clock in the Morning, when he di&s;cover'd two Bodies of Men of the late Kings Army, com|puted to con&s;i&s;t of four hundred each Body, marching &s;ilently between the Wood and the Mountains; but who, &s;o &s;oon as they perceiv'd them&s;elves to be e&s;py'd, beat their Drums; upon which, the Major drew up the chiefe&s;t part of his whole Party in a Plough'd field, and fac'd 'em: Pre&s;ently the Enemies Granadiers came over the Hedge, and made towards the Major, till &s;eeing the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tand firm, they al&s;o made a halt. Whereupon the Major, apprehending that the thirty Men that guarded the Booty, were not got clear of the Wood, and con&s;equently might be expo&s;ed to the Enemies Numbers, wheel'd off by the skirt of the Wood to their &s;uccor; and by that time he had got his Hor&s;e and Foot over the Bog, he heard the Enemy firing very thick upon the thirty Men, who bravely however oppos'd 'em, under the Command of Lieutenant <HI>Ellis.</HI> The noi&s;e of this firing brought in four&s;core more of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who had been laid to watch the <HI>Rapparees.</HI> Thereupon Major <HI>Wood</HI> order'd the Foot to march in two Parties on each &s;ide the River, while he with the Hor&s;e march'd between 'em both. Being in this manner come within &s;ight of the Enemy, and judging that the Hor&s;e might do mo&s;t &s;ervice, by fetching a compa&s;s about, and getting behind
<PB N="12" REF="9">the Rebels, he gallop'd round, with an intention to fall upon their Reer; which the Enemy perceiving, and being at the &s;ame time hard put to it by the Foot, began to make an orderly Re|treat. But then it was, that the Major, unwilling to lo&s;e his Ad|vantage, fell immediately upon-their Flank with his Hor&s;e, and that with &s;o much Courage and undaunted Bravery, that he put the Enemy fir&s;t into great di&s;order, and &s;oon after to an ab&s;olute flight. Both Hor&s;e and Foot pur&s;u'd the Fugitives quite through the Wood down to the Bog, and kill'd about 150 among whom was Capt. <HI>Chales,</HI> with 2 Lieutenants, and took Pri&s;oners Maj. <HI>John Fitz-Patrick</HI> who commanded the whole Force, 5 Captains, 9 Lieute|nants, 2 En&s;igns (belonging to the &s;everal Regiments of Coll. <HI>Butler</HI> of <HI>Ballyraggats,</HI> Collonel <HI>Robert Grace,</HI> Collonel <HI>Charles Moore,</HI> Sir <HI>Morice Eu&s;tace,</HI> and Collonel <HI>Simon Lutterel</HI>'s Dragoons) and a hundred and five private Souldiers, &s;ix Serjeants, &s;eventeen Cor|porals, a Surgcon and three Drums; together with a hundred and fifty Muskets: All which was done by a hundred and ten of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot, and thirty four Hor&s;e.

<P>The &s;ame day this memorable Action was performed; a Party of Collonel <HI>Brewer</HI>'s Men were going from <HI>Mullingar</HI> towards <HI>Kinnagan;</HI> at what time a Serjeant and four Souldiers lagging a good way behind, were &s;urpriz'd and murther'd by the <HI>Rap|parees;</HI> only one e&s;cap'd, whom they left for dead, and who&s;e Eyes they had mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly pick'd out with a Skean.</P>

<P><HI>May</HI> 11.

<P>They who beheld the va&s;t Preparations for this Campaign, had a fair pro&s;pect of their Maje&s;ties extream Care and Provi|dence for the total Recovery of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and were ea&s;ily convinc'd that the Publick Trea&s;ure was not now as formerly given for the Welfare, but expended for the De&s;truction of the Monarchy; parted with for the Honour of the Nation, but wa&s;ted upon Plea|&s;ure, while they beheld all the proper Ports of the Kingdom con|tinually fill'd with Ships and Ve&s;&s;els, &s;ome tran&s;porting Money, others Recruits to the Army; while they beheld &s;uch amazing Quantities of Provi&s;ion, Arms and Ammunition; 500 Draught-Hor&s;es at a time for the Carriages, and &s;uch other va&s;t &s;tores for the Artillery, with all other Nece&s;&s;aries for &s;o great an Enter|prize. Which &s;hews the difference of a Nation's being under the Care of good Stewards, and from being under the negligent Mi&s;|government of Profu&s;ene&s;s and unthrifty Prodigality.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> they were as bu&s;ie at the &s;ame time, as their A&s;&s;i&s;tance would permit 'em: And certain information was given, That their new <HI>French</HI> General <HI>St. Ruth,</HI> i&s;&s;u'd out all his Or|ders in the <HI>French</HI> King's Name, and requir'd &s;everal of the Rebel's Officers to take new Commi&s;&s;ions under the <HI>French</HI> King, in pro&s;ecution of a De&s;ign of &s;ubjecting <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> that had been long carried on in that Kingdom by <HI>Abbot Gra|velle,</HI> and of which his own Letters to a great Per&s;on in <HI>France,</HI> that have been &s;ince intercepted, are a &s;ufficient Evidence.</P>
<P>But before we launch into the grand Campaign, there is this Ob&s;ervation to be made, That though the&s;e le&s;&s;er Encounters which have been hitherto related, may &s;eem to be of little value, yet con&s;idering the continu'd &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> though for the mo&s;t part their Parties were much inferior to the Enemy, and the continu'd bad Fortune of the Rebels, &s;uch a Pro&s;perity mu&s;t needs be a great Encouragement to the one &s;ide, and no
<PB N="15" REF="10">&s;mall Di&s;heartning to the other, not to have one &s;mile of For|tune in their Favor. Add to this, the picking up of &s;o many of the Enemy for Hawks-meat, not &s;uddenly taken notice of by a cur&s;ory Reading, was like a kind of Hectick Feaver, wa&s;ting their Body by degrees; which if the condition of the Kingdom would have endur'd it, mu&s;t have con&s;um'd the whole Bulk of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Oppo&s;i|tion at the long run. For mo&s;t certainly it may be found by an ea&s;ie computation, that in le&s;s than two Months before the Campaign open'd, the Rebels lo&s;t, by the&s;e petty Gleanings, 1079, Men kill'd out right, and above 230 Pri&s;oners, in all 1309 Men, of which &s;ome were con&s;iderable Officers, and perhaps in the Number of the mo&s;t experienc'd and daring Commanders; whereas about 40 was the utmo&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> lo&s;s; be&s;ides, that the ill <HI>Omen</HI> of being always beaten, makes a deep impre&s;&s;ion in the Minds of Men more couragious than the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>But now all things being in a readine&s;s for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to take the Field, General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> Commander in Chief of their Ma je|&s;ties Forces in the Kingdom in <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon the 6th of <HI>May,</HI> de|camp'd from <HI>Mullingar;</HI> and being joyn'd the &s;ame day by Ge|neral <HI>Dougla&s;s</HI> with the Northern Forces, which made up the whole Army 15 Battalions of Foot, and 3000 Hor&s;e, upon the 7th of <HI>May</HI> came before <HI>Ballymore,</HI> &s;eated upon a tongue of firm Land, jetting out into a Lake, being in circumference about a Mile, ending on the two &s;ides with Bogs that are unacce&s;&s;ible, which leave but a very &s;treight Avenue from the main Land. The Enemy had fortified this place with two Retrenchments in the Winter, of which the fir&s;t was a Horn-work, the &s;econd two whole Ba&s;tions, who&s;e outward Curtains on each &s;ide extended down to the Lake; and within the la&s;t Retrenchment was an old <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Mount, &s;o fortified as that it made a third Retreat.</P>
<P>Upon the General's approach to the Town, the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Rovigny</HI> was &s;ent before with a &s;trong Detachment of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of a Pa&s;s between the Town and <HI>Athlone;</HI> and as &s;oon as the advanc'd part of the Army appear'd upon the Hills that look into the Fort, the Enemy began to play upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> with two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ield-Pieces, but without doing any harm. In the mean time a Detachment of Foot was &s;ent to po&s;|&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the Rebels out Po&s;ts, which they quitted upon the approach of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and ran as fa&s;t as they could into <HI>Ballymore;</HI> only a Serjeant and twelve Men continu'd firing out of a round Tower, and kill'd two of the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> But the
<PB N="16" REF="11">Tower &s;oon after being taken by A&s;&s;ault, the Serjeant was hang'd upon a high Hill, in &s;ight of the Enemy, for firing upon the Be|&s;iegers after the Communication was cut off from him and the Town. That Night the Be&s;iegers rai&s;ed five different Batteries; the fir&s;t of 12 Pounders, the &s;econd of &s;ix 18 Pounders, to ruin the &s;econd Retrenchment; the third of 8 Field-Pieces to break the Palli&s;adoes; the fourth of four 18 Pounders, and two 12 Pounders, which batter'd the Horn-work; as al&s;o a Lodgment on the &s;ame &s;ide for three Mortar pieces. All which were brought to play the &s;ame Night. About eight of the Clock the next Mor|ning, the General &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Governour, <HI>That if he and the Garri&s;on would &s;urrender within two Hours, he would &s;ave their Lives, and receive 'em as Pri&s;oners of War: If not, that they &s;hould expect no quarter.</HI> To which the Governor returning a &s;huffling fort of an An&s;wer, in hopes to get better Terms, the Bat|teries play'd on, and about Noon the Breaches of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Retrenchments were &s;o far advanc'd, and the Palli&s;ado's &s;o effectually cut down, that the General re&s;olv'd to &s;torm the Town in five &s;everal Places, on the Hornwork, and the two &s;ides of the Bog by help of Faggots, and by that means to divide the Garri&s;on, which con&s;i&s;ted of 1000 Men. The Be&s;iegers al&s;o had four large Wherries a float upon the Lake, which were brought from <HI>Dublin</HI> with a great deal of trouble, into which were put an hundred and fifty Granadiers, that at the time of the general A&s;lault, were to attack the Be&s;ieg'd on that &s;ide that lay open to the Lake. All which Preparations, and their own Condition, put them into &s;o great a Con&s;ternation, that they hung out &s;everal white Flags; and about &s;even a Clock in the Evening, when they left off firing on both &s;ides, the Governour Collonel <HI>Mich. Bourk,</HI> and &s;everal Officers came out, and &s;ubmitted to the General's Mercy.</P>
<P>Upon the 9th of <HI>May</HI> the Garri&s;on came forth, con&s;i&s;ting of 780 Men, drawn out of the Enemies &s;tanding-Army, be&s;ides 4 Field-Officers, 16 Captains, 14 Lieutenants, 12 En&s;igns and Cor|nets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and 259 <HI>Rapparees,</HI> all well arm'd; who all laying down their Arms, were made Pri&s;oners in the innermo&s;t part of the Fort. Be&s;ides the Garri&s;on, there were above 600 Women and Children, among whom a Load of Ammunition-Bread was or|der'd to be di&s;tributed. There was found in the Place &s;everal Sacks of <HI>French</HI> Oat-meal, about ten Barrels of Powder, with Shot proportionable in their Magazine, two Field pieces and about
<PB N="17" REF="11">three hundred Head of Cattel, and five hundred Sheep, which were given to the Souldiers.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Night that the Town &s;urrendred, there was a hot Alarum that the Enemy was at hand, with a Body of 25000 Men; which occa&s;ion'd the Be&s;iegers to double their Guards, and &s;end out a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Foot toward <HI>Athlone,</HI> who within two Miles of that place, &s;urpriz'd an advanc'd Guard of the Enemies a&s;leep the main Body con&s;i&s;ting of 1000 Men who retreated in &s;afety, in regard the <HI>engli&s;h</HI> had no Orders to ad|vance any farther.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as the Town was taken, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fell to work in re|pairing the Breaches, making &s;ome additions of new Works, and levelling the Batteries; and a Garri&s;on was put into it of 500 Men: The Pri&s;oners, being 51 Officers, and 900 Souldiers, were &s;ent a|way to <HI>Mullingar,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Dublin.</HI> After this, the General lay a while encamp'd near <HI>Ballymore,</HI> in expectation of the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg,</HI> who upon the 4th of <HI>June</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Thurles,</HI> with the Forces under his Command, con&s;i&s;ting of 12000 Hor&s;e and Foot.</P>

<P><HI>June</HI> 7. They marched on to <HI>Bir;</HI> and upon <HI>June</HI> the 10th, continu'd their march, and came to <HI>Streanes</HI> Town the 14th, and upon the 18th joyn'd the General, &s;ix Miles farther in the way to <HI>Athlone.</HI></P>
<P>On the 18 of <HI>June,</HI> early in the Morning, the Army march'd from <HI>Ballymore;</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> having joyn'd the General, they encampt at <HI>Ballymore</HI>'s Pa&s;s; from whence a &s;trong Detachment of Hor&s;e and Dragoons was fent to <HI>Ath|lone.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19th the Army came before the Place, pa&s;&s;ing through many narrow Lanes, which might have co&s;t a great many Men, had the Enemy as floutly defended 'em, as they might have done; and it &s;eem'd a new &s;ight, to behold none but <HI>French</HI> Colours in four parts of an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Upon the 20th of <HI>June,</HI> a Battery of ten 18 Pounders was fi|ni&s;h'd, and began to play upon the Ba&s;tion near the Water &s;ide looking toward <HI>Lanesborough;</HI> and the Guns were &s;o well directed, that by three of the Clock in the Afternoon, the whole Face, Flank, and part of the Curtain, was laid in Ruins; and thereupon the General gave Orders for an A&s;&s;ault to be made, which was per|form'd
<PB N="18" REF="12">in this manner: Fir&s;t march'd 300 detach'd Granadiers, then 50 Pioneers with Bavins, next 200 Fuziliers, and then 2 Re|giments of Foot, commanded by Brigadier <HI>Stewart;</HI> after which follow'd 200 Pioneers with more Bavins, and 20 Men with Felling-Axes, to cut away any Barricado of the Enemies they might meet in their way. All things being thus in a readine&s;s, about &s;ix in the Evening the Sign was given, by a di&s;charge of all the Cannon in Battery: Upon which, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> advanc'd in very good Or|der to the A&s;&s;ault. The Enemy &s;eem'd re&s;olv'd at fir&s;t to have maintain'd the Breach; but upon the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Hand-Granadiers, they fled, retiring in great con&s;u&s;ion to <HI>Connaught</HI>-&s;ide, divers al&s;o leaping over the <HI>Shannon</HI> for ha&s;te: So that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had nothing to do but to enter; which the whole Party did, and advanc'd to the Bridge; where lying open to the Ene|mies &s;hot from the other &s;ide, &s;everal of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were kill'd and wounded, till the Enginiers had compleated &s;ome Blinds to cover them from the Town. In this Action however, not above 20 of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were wounded, and &s;ome few &s;lain out-right: In the number of the fir&s;t was Brigadier <HI>Stewart,</HI> who was &s;hot in the right Arm and in the Neck, but not dangerou&s;ly; but Lieut. Coll. <HI>Gore,</HI> that led on the Granadiers, was &s;hot at the Breach; and Lieutenant <HI>Kirk</HI> of <HI>Villiars</HI>'s Regiment, was unfortu|nately kill'd by a Cannon-Ball, as he was viewing the Place from the top of a Hill that was ju&s;t by.</P>
<P>On the 24th, a private Souldier &s;eeing one of the Enemies Colours floating upon the River near the Bridge, threw him&s;elf into the Water; and though many &s;hot were made at him, brought it off, and pre&s;ented it to the General, who gave him a good Reward.</P>
<P>And thus one part of the Town being taken, upon the 25th of <HI>June,</HI> the Batteries again&s;t the other part of it were all fini&s;h'd, and thirty two Pieces of Cannon, and &s;ix Mortars, planted upon 'em, which play'd upon the Ca&s;tle and the Enemies Works, on the other &s;ide of the River, with great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The 27th at Night the Souldiers wrought hard to repair the Stone-Bridge, of which two Arches were broken down by the Ene|my: One of them was quite made up, and the other almo&s;t fini|&s;hed, when early next Morning the Enemy pull'd away &s;ome of the Planks, and threw them into the River; which made the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;olve to carry on a clo&s;e Gallery upon the Bridge; which being done accordingly, Orders were given for &s;torming
<PB N="19" REF="12">the Place on the 29th, at &s;even in the Morning; but before all things were in a readine&s;s for it, a &s;mall Party of the Enemy came out, and &s;et fire to the Gallery, though with the lo&s;s of mo&s;t of their Lives. This Accident occa&s;ion'd the deferring the A&s;&s;ault till the next day. In the mean time the Cannon and Bombs continually play'd upon the Town and Ca&s;tle, doing mo&s;t terrible execution. However, the &s;ucce&s;s the Enemy had in burning the Gallery, gave them &s;o great a&s;&s;urance, that they did not expect to be &s;o &s;oon attackt.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, all things being in a readine&s;s, in pur&s;uance of the Orders given by General <HI>Ginkle,</HI> upon <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 30th of <HI>June,</HI> about four a Clock in the Afternoon, the Attack was made by 1500 Granadiers, and 6 Battalions of Foot &s;tanding ready to &s;up|port 'em, if occa&s;ion &s;hould be. The Signal was the ringing of the <HI>Church bell,</HI> upon which the Granadiers (with whom M.G. <HI>Talma&s;h,</HI> tho' he did not Command that day, went along as a Voluntier) entred the Ford, which was the only Pa&s;&s;age the A&s;&s;ailants had, in regard the Bridge was &s;o broken, that they could not get over it. The Enemy at fir&s;t fired very &s;martly, but the A&s;&s;ailants, who waded up to their Brea&s;ts in Water with continual <HI>Huzzaing,</HI> ad|vanc'd under the &s;helter of their own Cannon; and throwing their Granadoes, forc'd the Enemy from their Po&s;ts and Tren|ches; and in le&s;s than half an hours time, made them&s;elves en|tirely Ma&s;ters of the Town, with all their Enemies Works and the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle. Major-General <HI>Maxwel,</HI> with &s;everal other Officers, and 200 common Souldiers, were taken Pri&s;o|ners; and between 1000 and 1200 were kill'd upon the Place, be&s;ides Officers of note, &s;uch as were Brigadier <HI>Mackelicuddy,</HI> Collonels <HI>Mac-Mahoon, O Neale, O Gara,</HI> Lieut Collonels <HI>Mac|genis</HI> and <HI>Barnwel;</HI> and Maj. <HI>Murray,</HI> Coll. <HI>Grace,</HI> being &s;lain the day before: The re&s;t e&s;cap'd over the Ramparts, and fled to the Enemies Camp; from whence &s;ome Battalions were coming to their Relief; but meeting with the Fugitives, and receiving a warm Salute from tho&s;e very Works that were &s;o very lately their own, they retreated back to their Camp.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were about 20 &s;lain, and 30 wounded; while all, both Officers and Souldiers, behav'd them&s;elves beyond an ordi|nary Imagination, and perhaps beyond the Parallel of many Hi&s;to|ries, where &s;o much Bravery of Enterprize is rarely to be found, for only 3000 Men to a&s;&s;ail a fortified Town, cro&s;s a River, and make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it in &s;o &s;hort a time, in the very

There were in the Town &s;ix Pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon, and two Mortars; but the &s;tores of Powder, Bullet and Provi&s;ions, were but &s;mall. The Town and Ca&s;tle were reduc'd to a heap of Ruins; and the Pri|&s;oners &s;aid, That before the Attack, there were kill'd in the Town about 1200 Men, by the Be&s;iegers Cannon and Bombs, of which, nor of their Bullets or Stones, the A&s;&s;ailants were no Niggards, as having be&s;tow'd upon the Place, before it was taken, 10000 Bullets, 600 Bombs, and &s;everal Tun of Stones.</P>
<P>The Town being thus reduc'd, the Enemy decamp'd in the Night-time, between the 30th of <HI>June,</HI> and 1&s;t of <HI>July,</HI> and re|treated ten Miles off, to a Place call'd <HI>Bally-Na&s;h,</HI> where they lay with the River <HI>Soke</HI> before 'em, giving out that they de&s;ign'd to &s;tand a Battel: In pur&s;uance of which Re&s;olution, they at the &s;ame time quitted <HI>Slego, James</HI>-Town, and <HI>Lanesborough,</HI> in &s;o much ha&s;te, that they left their Powder and great Guns behind 'em.</P>
<P>On the 10th of <HI>July</HI> General <HI>Ginkle</HI> pa&s;s'd the <HI>Shannon</HI> at <HI>Ath|lone;</HI> the Foot over a Bridge of Boats below the Town, the Hor&s;e and Artillery over the Stone-Bridge; and that Night they encamp'd about five Miles from <HI>Athlone.</HI></P>
<P>The 11th they march'd, and encampt on the left &s;ide of <HI>Ballina&s;low,</HI> upon the River <HI>Suc,</HI> with in three Miles of the Enemy, who lay very advantagiou&s;ly encampt at <HI>Aghriam,</HI> their left Wing &s;tretching out toward <HI>Kilkon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">el</HI> Abby, and their right upon <HI>Rilcommodon</HI>-Hills: Before them lay two Bogs, between which, the Road leads to <HI>Galloway.</HI> On their left lay the Ruins of an old Ca&s;tle, which was entrench'd and lin'd with Foot; and on their right they had made &s;everal Entrenchments for the &s;ecurity of their Camp.</P>
<P>On the 14th, in the Morning, the Army march'd from <HI>Bal|lina&s;low,</HI> and by eleven a Clock had pa&s;s'd the River <HI>Suc,</HI> the Hor&s;e at two Fords, and the Foot over the Stone-Bridge: Where after &s;ome skirmi&s;hing, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> drove in the Enemies out-Guards,
<PB N="21" REF="13">and the left Wing of their Maje&s;ties Army drew beyond the Bog, which cover'd the Enemies right Wing, and made room for the Foot to advance between that and them. In the mean time, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cannon had di&s;lodg'd the Rebels Hor&s;e, from the end of the narrow Lane that leads to <HI>Aghriam,</HI> and the Kings Hor&s;e and Foot took up their Po&s;t there, &s;till pouring over Men into a &s;mall &s;pot of firm Land, that lay between the two Bogs and the old Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Enemy drew down great Bodies of Hor&s;e and Foot upon the left Wing of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and were &s;o &s;trongly po&s;ted behind the high Banks that lay one behind a|nother, that the Foot had a very warm di&s;pute with the Rebels for two hours, but at la&s;t forc'd 'em to give ground, notwith&s;tan|ding new Supplies both of Hor&s;e and Foot were &s;till &s;ent by the Rebels to relieve and &s;econd tho&s;e that gave way. At the &s;ame time al&s;o three Battalions of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Foot advanc'd on the right hand, over the skirt of the Bog, and a little River that &s;upplies the <HI>Suc,</HI> into a Corn-Field, where they were warmly entertain'd by &s;everal of the Enemies Battalions and Squadrons. However, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> maintain'd their ground till more Regiments came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and forcing the-Enemy to retreat, gave time for the right Wing of Hor&s;e to come on, who immediately charg'd up the Hills upon the Squadrons of the Enemy; at what time the left Wing of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> having beaten the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> from their ground, and the Right pre&s;&s;ing hard upon 'em at the &s;ame time, put 'em into an ab&s;olute Rout.</P>
<P>The Victors pur&s;u'd the flying Rebels about four Miles; for Night would not permit 'em to do it any farther, in regard it was &s;ix a Clock in the Afternoon before both Armies engag'd, and eight in the Evening before the Enemy was ab&s;olutely routed.</P>

About four of the Clock in the Afternoon, the General Order'd all the Granadeers together with the Regiments of Collonel <HI>Kirk,</HI> Collonel <HI>Yiffin,</HI> and the Lord <HI>George Hamilton</HI> to Advance and Attack the Fort that &s;ecures <HI>Thomend</HI> Bridge; at what time the Be&s;ieged &s;ent two great Detachments out of the Town, to re|inforce
<PB N="32" REF="19">and &s;econd their own Party that defended it. But notwith&s;tanding all this, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> went on with that Courage and Bravery, that they beat the Enemy from their Works, who thereupon fled to the Town in hopes to have been let in. But the Governour fearing lea&s;t the Victorious <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hould have Enter'd with the fugitives, dur&s;t not let down the draw Bridge to receive them, which occa&s;ion'd a great &s;laughter of the vanqui&s;h'd Iri&s;h, &s;o that nothing was to be &s;een from the foot or <HI>Thomond</HI> Bridge to the draw Bridge, but heaps of dead Bodies. Six hundred of the Enemy were &s;lain, and about one handred and thirty raken Pri&s;oners, among which Number was Collonel <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">kelton</HI> (&s;ince dead of his wounds) two Lieutenant Collonels, two Majors, three Captains, &s;even Lieutenants and &s;ix En&s;igns. The lo&s;s which the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd was occa&s;ion'd more by their own Contempt of Danger, and too eager pur&s;uit of Victory, than the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Enemy. For all the while the conflict endur'd, the Enemy play'd with their Great and Small Shot from the Walls of the Town at a more than ordinary Rate: which was the rea|&s;on that the Mettle of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> precipitating them too far, they were much more than they needed to have been, expos'd to the Enemies Fire: &s;o that between two and three hundred were &s;lain and wounded, tho not any one of Remark.</P>
<P>The next day in the Afternoon the Gari&s;on beat a Parley on both &s;ides of the <HI>River,</HI> and de&s;ir'd a Truce, which was agreed upon by the General; which time being expir'd, <HI>Sarsfield</HI> and <HI>Wahop</HI> came forth, and de&s;ir'd the Truce might be continu'd for three days, to the End they might &s;end to their Hor&s;e, which lay toward <HI>Clare,</HI> to know upon what Conditions they expected to be comprehend|ed in the Capitulation.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>25th.</HI> Collonel <HI>Sheldon,</HI> and &s;ome other of the Enemies Officers came into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Camp, and thence went into <HI>Limerick.</HI> The next Day <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">rsfield</HI> and <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">hop</HI> din'd with the General; and the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> Sir <HI>David Collier,</HI> Collonel <HI>Tiffany</HI> and Collonel <HI>Fiper</HI> were &s;ent as Ho&s;tages into the Town, and the Lords <HI>We&s;tmeath, lveagh, Trimble&s;town</HI> and <HI>Lowth,</HI> remain'd in the Camp as Ho&s;tages for the Gari&s;on.
