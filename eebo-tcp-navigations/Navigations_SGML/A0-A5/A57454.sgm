<P>_THE kind Re|ception
which
the Publick has
given to a late
Book, call'd, An <HI>Account</HI> of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> (whereof Three
Large Editions have come
abroad in less than Three
<PB REF="4">
Months) encouraged me
to seek after an Account
of <HI>Sueden,</HI> I found all sorts
of People desirous to be in|form'd
in the state of this
other <HI>Northern</HI> Crown.</P>
<P>After diligent Enquiry,
I was at last so Fortunate as
to light on this Account in
<HI>Manuscript,</HI> written some
few years ago by a very
Able and Learned Gentle|man;
and hearing that seve|ral
Copies of it were got
abroad, I consider'd it might
at last chance to come forth
in Print less Correct than at
present I undertake to give
<PB REF="4">
it the World, whom I pre|tend
to oblige by a very
Accurate Edition; insomuch
that I hope the Author him|self
will not be offended at
this Undertaking, since 'tis
likely 'twould have been
published by others, not so
well to his Advantage.</P>
<P>You will find here a Re|lation
of Matter of Fact
only, though I will venture
to say, a very Exact one;
and such as I doubt not but
will be very Entertaining to
the Reader.</P>

are faithfully delivered
here; the Ingenious <HI>Author</HI>
of this Account being a Per|son
of so known and esta|blish'd a
Reputation.</P>
<P>For so much as relates to
my Publishing this Book,
I confess ingeneously, 'tis
as unknown to the Author,
as his Person is to me; but
his Candour, Parts, and
Learning appear plainly e|nough
by this Work, that
he took great Care and Pains
to compile it. If it prove
<PB REF="5">
to the Satisfaction of the Pub|lick,
as I doubt not but it
will, I shall not lose my La|bour,
nor you the Pleasure

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of Sueden in general.</HEAD>
<P>THE Dominions subject
to the Crown of <HI>Sueden</HI>
have in this and the last
Age been so enlarged, by the
Acquisitions, or (as some call
them) Encroachments made up|on
all their Neighbours, that they
<PB N="2" REF="8">
do not properly fall under one
General Description; the Quali|ties
and Characters of some of
its Provinces being as different as
their Situation: So that the Short
View here offer'd, will not reach
the more distant parts, but chiefly
respects the Kingdom of <HI>Sueden,</HI>
and Dukedom of <HI>Finland,</HI> which
have the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea on the South,
the unpassable Mountains of <HI>Nor|way</HI>
on the West, <HI>Lapland</HI> on the
North, and <HI>Moscovy</HI> on the East;
being extended from 56 to 69
Degrees of Northern Latitude,
and from 32 to 55 in Longitude;
and consequently are more than
twice as big as the Kingdom of
<HI>France:</HI> But the Abatements that
must be made for several Seas, and
many great Lakes, some whereof
above 80 <HI>English</HI> Miles long, and
20 broad, as also for Rocks,
Woods, Heaths, and Morasses,
<PB N="3" REF="8">
that cover very much of these
Countries, will reduce the habita|ble
part to a very small portion,
comparatively to the Extent of
the whole.</P>
<P>The Soil in places capable of
Cultivating, is tolerably Fruitful,
though seldom above half a foot
deep; and therefore more easily
Plowed, as it frequently is by one
Maid and an Oxe, and is general|ly
best where there is least of it,
that is, in the little spaces between
the Rocks; and frequently the
Barren Land enriched with the
Ashes of Trees growing on the
places that are burnt, and the
Seed raked among the Ashes, pro|duces
a plentiful Crop without
farther Cultivation.</P>
<P>This practice is so ancient, that
their Writers derive the Name of
<HI>Sueden</HI> from a word in their Lan|guage
that expresses it; but the
<PB N="4" REF="9">
danger of destroying the Woods
has of late occasioned some Laws
to limit that Custom.</P>
<P>If the Inhabitants were indu|strious,
above what necessity for|ces
them to, they might at least
have Corn sufficient of their own;
but as things are manag'd, they
have not, nor can subsist without
great Importations of all sorts of
Grain from the Countrey of <HI>Leif-land,</HI>
and other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI>
adjacent to the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea: And
notwithstanding these Supplies,
the poorest sort in many places
remote from Traffick, are fain to
grind the Bark of Birch-Trees to
mix with their Corn and make
Bread, of which they have not
always plenty.</P>
<P>The Cattel, as in other <HI>Northern</HI>
Countries, are generally of a ve|ry
small size; neither can the
Breed be bettered by bringing in
<PB N="5" REF="9">
larger from abroad, which soon
degenerate; because in Summer
the Grass is much less nourishing
than in the places from whence
they came; and in the Winter
they are usually half-starved, for
want of Fodder of all kinds,
which often falls so very short,
that they are forced to unthatch
their Houses to keep a part of their
Cattel alive. Their Sheep bear a
very course Wool, only fit to make
Cloathing for the Peasants. The
Horses, especially the <HI>Finnish,</HI> tho
small, are hardy, vigorous, strong,
sure-footed and nimble Trotters,
which is of great use to them, be|cause
of the length of their Win|ters,
and their fitness for Sleds,
which is their only Carriage in
that Season; and the Soldiers do
pretend, that in War they are not
only able to resist, but to break a
Body of the best <HI>German</HI> Horse.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="10">
Of Wild Beasts, which are ve|ry
plentiful in these parts, Bears,
Elkes, Deer, and Hares, are hunt|ed
for their Flesh, as also, toge|ther
wich Wolves, Foxes, Wild-Cats,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their Furs and Hides.
They hunt with less Ceremony
than elsewhere is used, taking all
advantages to shoot their Game,
at which they are generally very
dextrous. Parks there are but few,
and meanly stock'd, the Charge
of feeding Deer all Winter ex|ceeding
the Profit, and abating
the Pleasure of them. There are
no Rabbets in these Countries,
but what are brought in for Cu|riosity,
and kept Tame. In Win|ter
Foxes and Squirrels somewhat
change Colour, and become
Grayish, but Hares turn white as
Snow.</P>
<P>Fowl both Wild and Tame are
very plentiful and good in their
<PB N="7" REF="10">
kind, except Sea-Fowl, which feed
and taste of Fish: The most com|mon
are <HI>Orras</HI> and <HI>Keders,</HI> the for|mer
of the bigness of a <HI>Hen,</HI> the
other of a <HI>Turky;</HI> as also <HI>Partridges,</HI>
and a Bird somewhat resembling
them, called <HI>Yerpers.</HI> There are
taken in Winter great numbers of
small Birds, as <HI>Thrushes, Blackbirds,</HI>
and <HI>Sydenscwans;</HI> the last of the
bigness of <HI>Veldefares,</HI> but better
meat, supposed to come from
<HI>Lapland,</HI> or yet farther <HI>North;</HI> and
have their Name from the beau|tifulness
of their Feathers, some
of which are tipt at the point
with Scarlet. Pigeons there are,
those of the Woods very rare,
because of the Hawks; and of
the House-Pigeons none but
what are kept tame, because their
Food is scarce, and the danger of
the Hawks great if they go abroad.
Eagles, Hawks, and other rapaci|ous
<PB N="8" REF="11">
Fowl abound most in the
<HI>Northern</HI> and Desart parts, whi|ther
Nature seems to call them;
as may be gathered from a Story
credibly related, of a large Hawk
shot some years ago in the <HI>North|ern</HI>
Parts of <HI>Finland,</HI> which had on
one Leg a small Plate of Gold
with this Inscription, <HI>Ie Suis au
Roy;</HI> on the other, one of Silver
with these words, <HI>Duc de Chevereuse
me garde.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefest Lakes in <HI>Sueden</HI> are
the <HI>Vetter,</HI> the <HI>Wenner,</HI> and <HI>Maeler;</HI>
the first in <HI>Ostrogothia,</HI> remarkable
for its foretelling of Storms, by a
continual Thundering Noise the
day before in that Quarter whence
they arise; as also for the sudden
breaking of the Ice upon it, which
sometimes surprizes Travellers,
and in half an hour becomes Navi|gable:
For its great depth, in some
places above 300 Fathom, tho no
<PB N="9" REF="11">
part of the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea exceed 50;
it supplies the River <HI>Motala,</HI> which
runs through <HI>Norcopingh,</HI> where it
has a Fall of about 30 Foot, and
some Winters is so choak'd up with
Ice, that for many hours no Water
passes. The second is in <HI>Westrogo|thia,</HI>
from which issues the River
<HI>Elve,</HI> that, falling down a Rock
near Sixty Foot, passes by <HI>Gotten|burgh.</HI>
The third empties its self
at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> furnishing one side of
the Town with Fresh Water, as
the Sea does the other with Salt:
These and abundance of other
Lakes, whereof many like Ponds
have no Vents, and are called Inn-Seas,
are not ill stored with varie|ty
of Fish, <HI>Salmon, Pikes, Perch,
Tench, Trouts, Eels,</HI> and many o|ther
sorts unknown elsewhere, of
which the most plentiful is the
<HI>Streamling,</HI> a Fish less than a <HI>Pilcher,</HI>
taken in great quantities, and salt|ed
<PB N="10" REF="12">
in Barrels, and distributed o|ver
all the Countrey. Besides,
the <HI>North-Bottom</HI> or Bay that se|parates
<HI>Sueden</HI> and <HI>Finland,</HI> abounds
with <HI>Seals,</HI> of which a considera|ble
Quantity of Train Oyl is
made and exported; and in the
Lakes in <HI>Finland</HI> are vast quantities
of Pikes, which being taken, are
salted, dry'd, and sold at very cheap
Rates.</P>
<P>These Lakes are of great use
for the convenience of Carriages
both in Summer by Boats, and by
Sleds in Winter; and among them
and on the Sea-Coasts are almost
innumerable Islands of different
Sizes, whereof there are in <HI>Sueden</HI>
above 6000 that are Inhabited, the
rest are either bare Rocks, or co|vered
with Wood: <HI>Gotland, Oland,</HI>
and <HI>Aland,</HI> are Isles of large Ex|tent,
one being Sixty miles long,
and the others little less.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Their Woods and vast Forests
overspread much of the Country,
and are for the most part of Pines,
Fir, Beech, Birch, Alder, Juniper,
and some Oak; especially in the
Province of <HI>Bleaking,</HI> the Trees
growing in most places so close
together, and lying to rot where
they fall, that the Woods are scarce
passable.</P>
<P>These afford a plentiful and
cheap firing, and being generally
very straight and tall, are easily
convertible into Timber, fit for
all uses. In the parts near the
Mines, the Woods are much de|stroyed,
but that want is so well
supplied from distant places by the
convenience of Rivers and Winter-Carriages,
that they have Char|coal
above six times as cheap as it
is in <HI>England,</HI> tho indeed it is not
half so good.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
Of Mines in <HI>Sueden,</HI> there is
one of Silver, into which Work|men
are let down in Baskets to the
first Floor, which is 105 Fathom
under ground; the Roof there, is
as high as a Church, supported by
vast Arches of Oar; thence the
Descent is by Ladders or Baskets
to the lowest Mine, above forty
Fathom, where they now Work.
They have no Records so ancient
as the first Discovery either of
this or the Copper Mine, which
must needs have been the work
of many Ages; the Oar seldom
yields above 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and re|quires
great pains to Refine it;
they are also at the charge of a
Water-Mill to drain the Mine,
and have the benefit of another
that draws up the Oar. It yearly
produces about Twenty thousand
Crowns of Fine Silver, of which
the King has the Pre-emption,
<PB N="13" REF="13">
paying one fourth less than the
real Value. The Copper-Mine is a|bout
eighty Fathom deep, of great
extent, but subject to damage by
the falling in of the Roof; yet
that is sometimes recompenced
by the abundance of Oar that the
ruined Pillars yield, tho most
commonly the loss in that Case is
very great; the occasion of which
falls is attributed to the throwing
the Earth and Stones, brought out,
upon the Ground over the Mine,
by which the Pillars become over|charged,
and give way; and the
reason of this is said to be, that
the profit arising to those that are
concerned, is so little, that they
are not able to work it off as they
ought; and unless the King a|bates
considerable part of the Pro|fit
arising to the Crown from this
Mine, 'tis believed it will in
few years be at a stand, especi|ally
<PB N="14" REF="14">
if the designs of making Cop|per,
that are on foot elsewhere,
do take any tolerable effect. The
Copper yearly made out of this
Mine, amounts to the value of
about Two hundred thousand
pounds, of which the King has a
fourth part, not by way of Pre|emption,
but in kind; besides, that
upon the remainder, he has a Cu|stom
of 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> when it is ex|ported
unwrought.</P>
<P>Lately a Gentleman of <HI>Italy</HI>
came to <HI>Sueden</HI> with Proposals to
make Copper a shorter and chea|per
way than has hitherto been
practised, as to make that in five
Days, which before required
three Weeks, and with one fifth
part of the Charcoal, and with
fewer hands. The Bargain was
made, and his Reward agreed to
be a Hundred thousand Crowns;
the first Proof he made succeeded
<PB N="15" REF="14">
to admiration; but when he came
to work in earnest, and had got
his new-invented Ovens built to
his mind, the Miners, as he com|plained,
pickt out the very worst
Oar, and were otherwise so envi|ous
and untractable, that he failed
of success, and lost his Reward,
and not without difficulty obtain|ed
leave to buy Oar, and practice
his Invention at his own Charge,
as he now does.</P>
<P>Iron-Mines and Forges are in
great numbers, especially towards
the Mountainous parts, where they
have the convenience of Water-falls
to turn their Mills. From
these, besides supplying the Coun|try,
there is yearly exported Iron to
the value of near Three hundred
thousand pounds. But of late
years, the number of these Forges
has been so much increased, that
each endeavouring to undersell
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="2 pages">

<PB N="18" REF="15">
and scarce can be stopt till it
come at some Lake, or very large
Plain.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Summer</HI> season the Fields
are cloathed with variety of
Flowers, and the whole Coun|try
overspread with Strawberries,
Rasberries, Currants, and the
like, which grow upon every
Rock. In their Gardens, <HI>Mel|lons</HI>
are brought to good perfe|ction
in dry years; but <HI>Apricocks,
Peaches,</HI> and other Wall-fruits,
are almost as rare as <HI>Oranges;</HI>
they have <HI>Cherries</HI> of several sorts,
and some tolerably good, which
cannot be said of their <HI>Apples,
Pears,</HI> and <HI>Plumbs,</HI> that are nei|ther
common, nor well-tasted;
all kinds of Roots are in plenty,
and contribute much to the
Nourishment of the poor Peo|ple.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="15">
The <HI>Sun</HI> at highest is above
the Horizon of <HI>Stockholm</HI> Eigh|teen
hours and an half, and for
some Weeks makes a continual
Day. In <HI>Winter,</HI> the Days are
proportionably shorter, the <HI>Sun</HI>
being up but five hours and a
half, which defect is so well sup|pli'd
as to Lights, by the <HI>Moon,</HI>
and the whiteness of the Snow,
and clearness of the Sky, that
Travelling by Night is as usual
as by Day; and Journeys begun
in the Evening as frequently as
in the Morning. The want of
the <HI>Sun</HI>'s heat is repaired by Stoves
within doors, and warm Furs
abroad; instead of which, the
meaner sort use Sheep-skins, and
other the like Defences; and are
generally better provided with
Cloathing, befitting their Con|dition,
and the Climate they live
in, than the Common People of
<PB N="20" REF="16">
any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> tho where
any neglect or failure happens,
it usually proves fatal, and occa|sions
the loss of Noses, or other
Members, and sometimes of
Life; unless the usual Remedy
to expel the Frost when it has
seized any part, be early applied,
which is to remain in the Cold,
and rub the part affected with
Snow, till the Blood return to it
again.</P>
<P>What has been said in rela|tion
to <HI>Sueden,</HI> is in the main
applicable to <HI>Finland,</HI> except on|ly
that hitherto no Mines have
been discovered there. Its chief|est
Commodities are Pitch, and
Tar, all sorts of Wooden-ware,
Dried Fish, Cattle, Train Oyl,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Remainder also of this
Discourse, in what relates to the
<PB N="21" REF="16">
Laws, Government, Customs,
and Natural Dispositions of the
People, equally belongs to them,
with this difference, that the <HI>Fin|landers</HI>
are rather more hardy and
laborious, more Clownish, Igno|rant,
and Superstitious, than the
<HI>Suedes.</HI></P>

<DIV1 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="22" REF="17">
<HEAD>CHAP. II</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Provinces and Cities
of Sueden.</HEAD>
<P>THE Country is divided in|to
Twenty five Provinces,
each of which is governed by an
Officer, called <HI>Landshofdingh,</HI>
whose Authority comprehends
that of Lord Leiutenant, and
Sheriff together, except where
there is a General Governor, as
in <HI>Finland,</HI> and upon the Borders
of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> to whom
the Governor of each Province
is subordinate, and has thereby a
more restrained Authority; these
Officers are placed by the King,
and take an Oath, to keep the
Province for his Majesty, and his
Heirs, to govern according to the
<PB N="23" REF="17">
Laws of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and such In|structions
as they shall receive
from his Majesty, and to quit
the Province whenever he shall
call them thence.</P>
<P>To them and their Subordinate
Officers (who are all of the King's
chusing) the Execution of Judicial
Sentences, the Collection of the
King's Revenues, the care of
Forests, Parks, and other Crown
Lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is committed.</P>
<P>Of Cities, those of <HI>Stockholm,
Gottenburgh, Calmar,</HI> and Two or
Three more, may deserve that
Name: The other Corporations,
which in all make not an Hun|dred,
scarce exceed some Villages
in <HI>England;</HI> they are all Govern|ed
by Burgomasters, and Coun|sellors
Chosen by the King out of
their own Body, or at least, such
as are of the quality of Burghers,
no Gentleman accepting of those
<PB N="24" REF="18">
Employments. Their Offices and
Salaries are for Life, or rather du|ring
their good Behaviour. The
Priviledges of Cities are derived
from the King, and for the most
part are owing to the Wisdom of
<HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI> the Author of
their best and most regular Con|stitutions
at Home, as well as of
their Glory Abroad.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Stockholm</HI> lies in
59 Degrees, 20 Min. <HI>North</HI> Lati|tude,
and about 41 Longitude.
About 300 years ago, it was only
a bare Island with Two or Three
Cottages for Fishers; but upon
the Building of a Castle there, to
stop the inroads of the <HI>Russians,</HI>
and the Translation of the Court
thither, it grew by degrees to
surpass the other more Ancient
Cities, and it is at present the <HI>Me|tropolis</HI>
of this Kingdom, and sup|posed
to be as Populous as <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="18">
The Castle here, which is cove|red
with Copper, is a Place of no
Strength or Beauty, but of great
use, being a spacious Building,

Court of Justice, Colledges of
War, Chancery, Treasury, Redu|ction,
Liquidation, Commerce,

Chappel, Library, Archives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
It Lodges very few of the Inferi|our
Officers and Servants of the

Foot Guards, being Quartered
upon the Burghers at their Land|lords
Charge for Lodging, Fire

large Churches built of Brick, and

Two more now Building, and

The Palace of the Nobility,
which is the place of their Assem|bly
at the Convention of Estates,
and the Depository of their Pri|viledges,
Titles, and such other
Records as concern their Body, is
a very stately Pile; as is also the
Bank, built at the City's Charge;
which, together with several Mag|nificent
Houses of the Nobility,
are covered with Copper, and
make a handsome Prospect; most
of the Burghers Houses are built
of Brick, except in the Suburbs,
where they are of Wood, and
thereby exposed to the danger of
Fire; which commonly, when it
gets to a head, destroys all before
it, in the Quarter where it hap|pens;
to repair which Misfor|tune,
they sometimes send the
Dimensions of the House they in|tend
to build into <HI>Finland,</HI> where
the Walls and several Separations
<PB N="27" REF="19">
are built of Pieces of Timber
laid one upon another, and joined
at the Corners, and afterwards
mark'd, taken down, and sent by
Water to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> there to be set
up and finish'd, and when they
are kept in good Repair, will last
Thirty or Forty Years, and are
warmer, cleanlier, and more
healthful than those of either Brick
or Stone. To prevent the Danger
of Fire, the City is divided into
Twelve Wards, and in each of
these is a Master and Four Assi|stants,
who upon notice of any
Fire are immediately to repair to
it, as also all Porters and Labour|ers,
and to range themselves un|der
the Master of their respective
Wards: There is also a Fire-Watch
by Night, who walks a|bout
only to that purpose; and in
each Church-Steeple Watch is
kept, and a Bell Tolled upon the
<PB N="28" REF="20">
first appearance of any Fire.</P>
<P>The Government of this City
is in the hands of the Great <HI>Stadt|holder,</HI>
who is also a Privy Coun|sellor;
he sits once a Week in the
Town House, and presides also
in the College of Execution, as|sisted
by an Under <HI>Stadtholder,</HI> and
the <HI>Bailiff</HI> of the Castle; next to
him are the Four Burghmasters,
one for Justice, another for Trade,
the Third for the Polity of the
City, and the Fourth has the In|spection
over all Publick and Pri|vate
Buildings, and determines
such Cases as arise on that account;
with them the Counsellors of the
City always sit and give their
Votes, the Majority of which
concludes: Their Number is un|certain,
but usually about Twen|ty,
most Merchants and Shop|keepers,
or such as have served the
King in some Inferior Employ|ments;
<PB N="29" REF="20">
and besides their Salary
they have an Immunity from such
Impositions as are laid on the In|habitants,
to support the Govern|ment
of the City, which pays all
its Officers and Servants, and
maintains a Guard of 300 men,
and defrays the Charge of all Pub|lick
Buildings and Repairs. To
support this Expence, besides a
Duty belonging to the City, upon
Goods Imported and Exported,
(which is about 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI> of the
Customs paid the King, and a|mounts
to about 4000 <HI>l. per An.</HI>)
the Magistrates impose a Yearly
Tax on the Burghers, in which
they are assisted by a Common-Council
of Forty eight (which
chuses its own Members), and
meets every Spring to propor|tion
the Payments for the en|suing
Year. On the Richer Tra|ders
they usually impose 40, 50,
<PB N="30" REF="21">
or 60 <HI>l. sterling;</HI> and upon others
of a meaner Condition, as Shoe-makers,
Taylors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 5 or 6 <HI>l.</HI>
and no Housekeeper less than 15 <HI>s.</HI>
besides Quartering the Guards, In|ferior
Officers, and Servants of
the Court, with other lesser
Charges; which all together,
would be thought a great burthen
even in Richer Countries; neither
is it otherwise esteemed by the
Inhabitants of this City, who can
scarce be kept in heart by the Pri|viledges
they enjoy, as well in
Customs, as in the Trade of the
Place, which must needs pass
through their hands; the Natives
of other parts of the Kingdom,
as well as Foreigners, being obli|ged
to deal only with the Burgh|ers,
except those of the Gentry
that make Iron, who have a Pri|vilege
to sell it immediately to
Strangers.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="21">
This City is in a manner the
Staple of <HI>Sueden,</HI> to which most
of the Goods of their own Growth,
viz. <HI>Iron, Copper, Wire, Pitch, Tarr,
Masts, Deals,</HI> &amp;c. are brought to
be Exported. The greatest part
of the Commodities Imported
from abroad come to this Port,
where there is a Haven capable
of receiving 1000 Sail of Ships,
and has a Bridge or Key near an
<HI>English</HI> Mile long, to which the
greatest Vessels may lye with
their Broadsides: The only In|convenience
is, That it is Ten
Miles from the Sea, and the River
very crooked, and no Tides.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="22">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Laws of Sueden.</HEAD>
<P>THE Laws of <HI>Sueden</HI> were
anciently as various as the
Provinces were numerous, each
of which had Statutes and Cu|stoms
peculiar to its self, enacted
as occasion required by the <HI>Lagh</HI>-man
or Governor of the Province,
who was chosen by the People,
and Invested with great Authori|ty,
especially while the Kingdom
was Elective, his Suffrage con|cluding
the Province he governed.
This variety was necessarily at|tended
with great Confusion;
for remedy whereof, about Four-score
Years ago, one Body of
Laws was compiled for the di|rection
of the whole Kingdom;
<PB N="33" REF="22">
yet this Collection is but an im|perfect
piece, and the Laws so
few, and concieved in such gene|ral
terms, that in most cases they
need the assistance of the Civil
Law; and after all, the Final De|termination
depends much upon
the Inclinations of the Bench;
which in a poor Countrey, where
Salaries are small, is often filled
with such as are of Weak Parts,
and subject to Corruption upon
very small Temptations. The
Effects of this would be more vi|sible,
if each Superior Court did
not keep a Cheque upon the Low|er,
and the King's Court of Re|vision
over-awe them all, to which
all Civil Causes importing the
Sum of 70 <HI>l.</HI> are appealable;
and very few end before they have
been brought thither. In this Su|preme
Court his Majesty very fre|quently
sits with great Patience
<PB N="34" REF="23">
and Application; and in Seven
Years time has determined more
Causes than the Senators did in
Twenty before.</P>
<P>His Majesty is observed always
to make a short Mental Prayer at
first sitting down there.</P>
<P>In this Court the President of
the Chancery, and Two or Three
other privy Counsellors, do also
sit, so does the Chancellor of the
Court (an Officer next in degree
to a Privy Counsellor) who is
President of the Under Revision,
where he and Two Secretaries do
put Business into a Method fit to
be brought before the King.</P>
<P>The Courts of Justice inferior
to this are of three Degrees; of
the lowest Degree of first Instance,
there is one in each Corporation,
(besides <HI>Stockholm,</HI> in which there
are Three), as also in each Di|strict
or Territory, whereof every
<PB N="35" REF="23">
Province contains several, some
above Twenty; in the former
(Cities) an Alderman or Coun|sellor
presides, and has some of
his Brethren for Assistants; in the
latter, the Governor of the Terri|tory,
with a standing Jury; his
Court is <HI>Ambulatory,</HI> and usually
kept near or upon the place where
the Fact or Trespass was com|mitted.</P>
<P>In these Courts Examinations
are taken, and matters not exceed|ing
Forty Shillings are determined,
the rest transmitted to the next Su|perior
Court, of which in every
Corporation there is one, where
the <HI>Burghmaster</HI> is President, and
the Aldermen Assistants; and so
in every Province there is one or
more of these Courts, the Presi|dent
whereof retains the name of
<HI>Lagh</HI>-man, without other Autho|rity
than that of a Judge; from
<PB N="36" REF="24">
these all Causes of Blood must be
transmitted to the respective Na|tional
Courts, where they are de|termined
without further Appeal;
and thither also all Civil Actions,
not exceeding 20 <HI>l.</HI> may be ap|pealed;
of these National Courts
there are Three, one for the
Kingdom of <HI>Sueden,</HI> held at <HI>Stock|holm;</HI>
another for the Kingdom of
<HI>Gothia,</HI> kept at <HI>Iencopingh;</HI> and a
Third for the Dukedom of <HI>Fin|land,</HI>
at <HI>Abo:</HI> In each of these a
Privy Counsellor is President, and
above half the Assessors are to be
Gentlemen: All these Courts sit
continually, or at most have but
short Vacations; and not being
pestered with too much Formality
give Causes a speedy dispatch, un|less
they be retarded by some un|der-hand
Engagements.</P>
<P>Actions relating to the Sea are
Triable in the ordinary Courts,
<PB N="37" REF="24">
according to their Sea-Laws,
founded upon those Ancient ones
of <HI>Wisby</HI> in <HI>Gothland,</HI> which have
formerly been as famous in the
<HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, as the Laws of the
<HI>Rhodes</HI> and <HI>Oleron</HI> in other places.
The Court of Admiralty has not
any peculiar Jurisdiction in the
Administration of these Laws,
but only in such matters as direct|ly
concern the King's Fleet, and
in some places that belong imme|diately
to the <HI>Admiralty.</HI></P>
<P>For Causes Ecclesiastical there
is a Consistory in each Diocess, of
which the respective Bishop is
President, where Causes of Ba|stardy,
Contracts of Marriage,
and other matters of that nature,
are try'd; and Church-Censures
of Penance, Divorce, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in|flicted:
These Courts have not
Power to administer an Oath, nor
to inflict any Corporal Punish|ment.
<PB N="38" REF="25">
From them there lies an
Appeal to the respective National
Court, and in some Cases to the
King, as in all other matters.</P>
<P>For matters relating to the
Mines, besides Inferior Courts,
and Officers settled in the respe|ctive
parts of the Countrey, a
General Court, called the Col|lege
of the Mines, sits at <HI>Stockholm,</HI>
of which most commonly the
President of the Treasury is chief,
with a Vice-President, and other
Assessors; the Laws in this regard
are more exact and particular than
in other matters, and for the most
part Justice very carefully admini|stred.</P>
<P>The Power of executing all
Judicial Sentences is lodged in the
Governors of the Provinces, the
Stadtholders of <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and o|ther
places, and from them deri|ved
to Inferior Officers, who are
<PB N="39" REF="25">
accountable to the National
Courts; whither they may be
Convened and punish'd, upon
plain Proof of Default. But the
Proof being difficult, and Mini+sters
of Justice apt to favour each
other, they take great liberty to
delay Execution, or to arbitrate,
and put their own sense upon Sen|tences;
so that this part of Ju|stice
is administred the worst of
all others, and has an Influence
not only at home, but lessens the
Credit of the <HI>Suedish</HI> Subjects a|broad,
against whom Justice can|not
be obtained without great dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>The ordinary Charges of Law-Suits
are no where more moderate
than in <HI>Sueden;</HI> the greatest bur|then
arising from a late Constitu|tion,
That all Declarations, Acts,
and Sentences, must be written
upon Seal'd Paper of different
<PB N="40" REF="26">
Prizes, from Two pence to Seven
Shillings a Sheet, according to the
Quality of the Cause, the Bene|fit
of which accrues to the King,
and is computed to bring in about
3000 <HI>l.</HI> a year; other Charges are
very few, every man being per|mitted
(in Criminal Actions com|pelled)
to plead his own Cause:
Accordingly the Practice of the
Law is below a Gentleman, and
rather the Refuge than the Choice
of meaner persons, who are ve|ry
few in Number, and for the
most part very poor.</P>
<P>The Custom of a Jury of
Twelve men is so ancient in <HI>Sue|den,</HI>
that their Writers pretend
it had its Original among them,
and was thence derived to other
Nations; but at present it is dis|used
every where, except only
in the Lower Courts in the Coun|try,
and there the Jury-men are
<PB N="41" REF="26">
for Life, and have Salaries; they
have this peculiar to themselves,
that among them there must be
an unanimous Concurrence to de|termine
a Cause, which in other
Courts is done by a Majority of
Voices.</P>
<P>Titles to Estates are rendred
more secure, and less subject to
Contests, by the Registers that are
kept of all Sales and Alienations,
as well as of other Engagements
of them: The Purchaser running
the hazard of having an After-Bargain
take place of his, if he
omit the Recording of his Trans|action
in the proper Court.</P>
<P>In Criminal Matters, where
the Fact is not very evident, or
where the Judges are very favour|able,
the Defendant is admitted
to purge himself by Oath, to
which is oftentimes added the
Oath of Six or Twelve other men&punc;
<PB N="42" REF="27">
who are all Vouchers of his Inte|grity.</P>
<P>Treason, Murther, Double
Adultrey, Burning of Houses,
Witchcraft, and the like Heinous
Crimes, are punished with Death,
which is executed by hanging of
Men, and beheading of Women;
to which burning alive or dead,
quartering and hanging in Chains,
is sometimes added, according to
the Nature of the Crime. Cri|minals
of the Gentry and Nobili|ty,
are usually shot to Death.</P>
<P>The Punishment of Stealing,
is of late instead of Death, chang|ed
into a kind of perpetual Sla|very,
the Guilty party being con|demned
to work all his Life for&rindx;
the King, in making Fortificati|ons,
or other Drudgery, and al|ways
has a Collar of Iron about
his Neck, with a Bow coming
over his Head, to which is a Bell
<PB N="43" REF="27">
fastened, that rings as he goes
along.</P>
<P>Duels between Gentlemen, if
the one Party be kill'd, are pu|nish'd
with the Survivor's Death,
and a Note of Infamy upon the
Memory of both; if neither be
kill'd, they are both condemned
to a Prison, with Bread and Wa|ter
for two years, to which is
added a Fine of 1000 Crowns;
or one years Imprisonment, and
2000 Crowns. Reparation of Ho|nour
in case of Affront, is referred
to the respective National Court,
where Recantation and Publick
Begging of Pardon is usually in|flicted.</P>
<P>Estates as well acquired, as in|herited,
descend to the Children
in equal Portions, of which a Son
has two, and a Daughter one;
nor is it in the power of the Pa|rents
to alter this Proportion with|out
<PB N="44" REF="28">
the Intervention of a Judi|cial
Sentence in case of their
Children's disobedience, only
they may bequeath a Tenth of
their acquired Possessions to such
Child, or other, as they will fa|vour.
Where an Estate descends
incumbred with Debts, the Heir
usually takes two or three Months
time, as the Law allows, to
search into the Condition of the
Deceased's Estate, and then ei|ther
accepts the Inheritance, or
leaves it to the Law, which in
that case Administers; as late|ly,
besides other Instances, was
practised upon the decease of
the late <HI>Rix Drost Count Mag|nus
De la Gardier,</HI> the King's Un|kle.</P>

<P>THE Nature of the Climate,

vigorous Constitution; and that
confirm'd by a hardy Education,

qualifies them to endure what|ever

Faculties of their Bodies, and
indispose them for any great de|gree
of Dexterity and Nimble|ness;
and the same may be said
in a great measure, of their Minds
too, which seldom are found en|dued
with any eminent share of
Vivacity or Pregnancy of Wit;
yet by Industry, Experience, and
Travelling, not a few of them
arrive at a mature and solid
Judgment, being led by their
Genius to serious things, in which
they that have Patience to go
through with the Studies they ap|ply
themselves to, become Excel|lent,
and merit the Title of great
and able Men; but this seems not
to be the Talent of this Nation,
they being generally more apt to
sit down with superficial Acquisi|tions,
than to pursue their Studies
to a fundamental degree.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="30">
This Disposition of Body and
Mind qualifies them more for a
Life of Labour and Fatigue, than
of Art and Curiosity, and the effect
of it is visible in all Orders of Men
among them.</P>
<P>The Nobility mostly apply
themselves to a Military Life, in
which they are more famous for
Courage, and enduring Hard|ships,
than for Stratagems and
Intrigues. They that are employ|ed
in the Administration of Civil
Affairs, tho they are indeed La|borious
and Indefatigable in their
business, yet they seldom raise
their Speculations above what the
necessity of their Employments
require, their Abilities proceed|ing
not so much from Study, as
Experience in the Tract of busi|ness.</P>
<P>In point of Learning, they, like
their Neighbours the <HI>Germans,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="31">
are more given to Transcribe,
and make Collections, than Di|gest
their own Thoughts; and com|monly
proportion their Studies to
their occasions.</P>
<P>In matters of Trade, they more
easily do the Drudgery, than dive
into the Mystery, either of Com|merce
or Manufactures, in which
they usually set up for Masters
before they be half taught; so
that in all such things as require
Ingenuity, Neatness, or Dexteri|ty,
they are forc'd to be served by
Strangers. Their Common Sol|diers
endure Cold and Hunger,
and long Marches, and hard La|bour
to admiration; but they
learn their Duty very slowly, and
are serviceable more by their Obe|dience
to command, and standing
their Ground, than by any great
forwardness to attack their Ene|my,
or in nimbleness and address
<PB N="49" REF="31">
in executing their Orders; and so
their Peasants are tolerably La|borious
when need compels them,
but have little regard to Neatness
in their Work, and are hardly
brought to quit their old, slow, and
toilsome Methods, for such new
Inventions as are more dextrous
and easy.</P>
<P>The Dispositions more peculiar
to the several degrees of these Peo|ple,
are, That the Nobility and
Gentry are naturally Men of
Courage, and of a Warlike Tem|per,
have a graceful Deportment,
inclined to value themselves at a
High rate, and make the best Ap|pearance
they possibly can, that
they may gain the respect of o|thers;
and are therefore more ex|cessive
in the number of their At|tendants,
Sumptuous Buildings,
and Rich Apparel, than in the
plentifulness of their Tables, or
<PB N="50" REF="32">
other less observ'd Occasions.
They never descend to any Em|ployments
in the Church, the
Practice of Law or Physick, or
the Exercise of any Trade; and
tho to gain experience in Maritine
Affairs, they submit to the lowest
Offices abroad, yet at home there
is but one Example known of a
Gentleman, that accepted the
Command of a Merchant's Ship.</P>
<P>The Clergy are but moderately
Learned, and little acquainted
with the Disputes about Religion,
as having no Adversaries to op|pose;
they affect Gravity, and
long Beards; are esteemed for their
Hospitality, and have great Au|thority
among the Common Peo|ple.
The Burghers are not very
Intelligent in Trade, nor able to
do their business without Credit
from abroad; rather inclined to
impose upon those they can over|reach,
<PB N="51" REF="32">
than follow their Calling
in a fair way. The Peasants, when
Sober, are very obsequious and
respectful, but Drink makes them
mad and ungovernable; most of
them live in a very poor Condition,
and are taught by necessity to pra|ctice
several Arts in a rude man|ner,
as the making their Shooes,
Cloathes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the several Instru|ments
of Husbandry, and other
necessaries, that they cannot spare
Money to buy: And to keep
them to this, as also to favour the
Cities, it is not permitted to more
than one Taylor, or other such
Artisan, to dwell in the same Pa|rish,
tho it be never so large, as
many of them are above twenty
Miles in compass.</P>
<P>In general, it may be said of the
whole Nation, that they are a
People very Religious in their way,
and constant frequenters of the
<PB N="52" REF="33">
Church, eminently Loyal and
Affected to Monarchy, Grave e|ven
to Formality; Sober, more
out of necessity, than Principles of
temperance; apt to entertain Sus|pitions,
and to envy each other,
as well as Strangers; more in|clined
to pilfering, and such se|cret
Frauds, than to such open Vio|lences,
as breaking of Houses, or
Robbing on the Highways: Crimes
as rarely committed in this, as in
any Country whatever.</P>

<P>CHRISTIANITY was
not received into <HI>Sueden,</HI> till
about the beginning of the Ninth
Century; and not into <HI>Finland</HI> till
near three hundred Years after;
and if not first Preached, was at
least first Established by <HI>English</HI>
Divines, of whom the chiefest
was St. <HI>Sigfrid,</HI> who, as their Hi|stories
relate, quitted the Arch-Bishoprick
of <HI>York,</HI> to become
the Apostle of the <HI>Goths,</HI> as they
stile him; with him three of his
Nephews that he brought thither,
were Martyred by the <HI>Heathen
Goths.</HI> So also was St. <HI>Eskill,</HI> and
other <HI>English,</HI> by the <HI>Suedes;</HI> and
about the Year 1150. St. <HI>Henry,</HI>

an <HI>English</HI> Bishop, accompani'd
St. <HI>Erick,</HI> King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> in his
Expedition to <HI>Finland,</HI> which the
King conquered, and the Bishop
converted into <HI>Christianity;</HI> he al|so
was Martyred by the Infidels,
and lies buried at <HI>Abo,</HI> the Metro|polis
of that Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reformation,</HI> as well there,
as in <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> began
soon after the Neighbouring
parts of <HI>Germany</HI> had imbraced
<HI>Luther</HI>'s Tenets, and was esta|blished
according to his Plat|form.
The Tyranny of King
<HI>Christian</HI> the Second, who then
wore these three <HI>Northern</HI> Crowns,
gave an opportunity to <HI>Gustavus,</HI>
the Founder of the present Royal
Family, both to alter Religion,
and advance himself to the Re|gal
Dignity, which till that time
was <HI>Elective,</HI> but was then made
<HI>Hereditary</HI> to his Family; in which
<PB N="55" REF="34">
it has since continued, as the
<HI>Lutheran</HI> Religion has also done
in the Country, never but once
disturbed from abroad, and since
that disturbance never distracted
at home with Non-conformity;
all the Orders of Men agreeing
in a constant Attendance on Di|vine
Service, and a Zeal for their
own Way, without any nice En|quiries
into disputable Points,
either in their own Tenets, or
those of other Churches; where|by
it becomes the business of their
Preachers, rather to persuade the
Practice of Piety, than to oppose
the Doctrine of others, or defend
their own.</P>
<P>The Church is governed by
an Archbishop and Ten Bishops,
whose Studies are confined to
their own Employments, being
never called to Council, but on|ly
at the Assembly of the States,
<PB N="56" REF="35">
nor troubled with the Admini|stration
of any Secular Affair:
their Revenues are very mode|rate,
the Archbishop of <HI>Upsall</HI> not
Importing 400 <HI>l.</HI> a year, and the
Bishopricks after that Proportion.
Under them are Seven or Eight Su|perintendents,
who have all the
Power of Bishops, and only want
the Name; and over each Ten
Churches is a Provost or Rural
Dean, with some Authority over
the Inferior Clergy, of whom the
Sum total may best be computed
by the Number of Churches,
which in <HI>Sueden</HI> and <HI>Finland</HI> is
short of Two thousand; to which
the Addition of Chaplains and
Curates will encrease the Body of
the Clergy to near Four thousand
persons; they are all the Sons of
Peasants or mean Burghers, and
can therefore content themselves
with the small Income of their
<PB N="57" REF="35">
Places, which besides more in|considerable
Dues, arises from
Glebe-Lands, and one Third of
the Tythes, of which the other
two Thirds are annexed to the
Crown, to be employ'd in Pi|ous
Uses: However, the Clergy
have generally wherewithal to
exercise Hospitality, and are the
constant Refuge of Poor Tra|vellers,
especially Strangers, who
use to go from Priest to Priest,
as elsewhere from Constable to
Constable.</P>
<P>The Clergy of each Diocess,
upon the Death of their Bishop,
propose Three persons to the
King, who either chuses one of
them, or some other, to succeed
in that Office; which is also
practised in the Choice of Su|perintendents.
In the Choice of
an Archbishop all the Chapters
in the Kingdom vote, but the
<PB N="58" REF="36">
Determination is altogether in
the King's breast. His Majesty
hath also the Patronage of most
Churches, some few only being
in the Disposal of the Nobili|ty.
Many of their Churches are
adorn'd with variety of Scul|ptures,
Painting, Gilding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
All of them are kept neat and
clean, and in good Repair, fur|nish'd
as well in Countrey as
City with Rich Altar-Clothes,
Copes, and other Vestments.</P>
<P>For the more regular Go|vernment
of the Church it has
been found necessary to cause
the Ancient Ecclesiastical Laws
and Canons to be revised by a
Committee chosen out of the
several Bodies of the Estates,
who have spent some years in
that matter, and at last present|ed
the King with a New Sy|stem
of Church-Laws; where|in
<PB N="59" REF="36">
his Majesty, having caused
such Alterations to be made as
he thought fit, has lately ap|proved
and publish'd them.</P>
<P>Of these&punc; some that concern
their Religion in general, shall
here be taken notice of. By
these New Canons it is or|dain'd,
That</P>
<Q><P>If any <HI>Suedish</HI> Subject change
his Religion, he shall be ba|nish'd
the Kingdom, and lose
all Right of Inheritance both
for himself and his Descen|dants.</P><P>If any continue Excommu|nicated
above a Year, he shall
be Imprisoned a Month with
Bread and Water, and then ba|nish'd.</P><P>If any bring into the Coun|trey
Teachers of another Re|ligion,
<PB N="60" REF="37">
he shall be Fin'd and
Banish'd.</P><P>Foreign Ministers shall en|joy
the Free Exercise of their
Religion, only for themselves
and Families.</P><P>Strangers of a different Re|ligion
shall have no Publick
Exercise of it; and their Chil|dren
shall be baptized by <HI>Lu|theran</HI>
Ministers, and educated
in that Religion&punc; otherwise
they shall not have the Privi|leges
of <HI>Suedish</HI> Subjects.</P></Q>
<P>These Laws, as they oblige
the Clergy to a more constant
Attendance on all the parts of their
Duty, than has formerly been
practised, so they require the
Laity to frequent the Church on
all occasions; and the Civil Ma|gistrates,
especially on Days of
<PB N="61" REF="37">
great Solemnity, make very strict
search, and punish such as are
found absent from Church with|out
a just Excuse, with Im|prisonment
and other Severities:
But the Clergy are not intrust|ed
with the sole Administration
of these Laws, nor impower'd
by them to transact matters of
any great moment, without the
concurrence of the Civil Power;
for besides that many Causes,
formerly Triable in Ecclesiasti|cal
Courts, are now transferr'd
to the Secular Magistrates; the
King reserves to his own cog|nizance
several cases of that
kind, especially the Point of
<HI>Excommunication,</HI> which the Cler|gy
are not permitted to pro|nounce
against any one, till
the King hath been acquaint|ed
with the Case, and gives
<PB N="62" REF="38">
leave; which Caution is used
because of the consequence,
which is, the Loss of a Sub|ject.</P>

<P>LEARNING, whatever

can plead no great Antiqui|ty

of an University at <HI>Up|sall</HI>
being not above Three hun|dred
years ago; and few Mo|numents
extant of a more An|cient

Inscriptions, rudely cut upon
Rocks and unhew'n Stones,
which are every where found;
but as they have no Date, so
they seldom express more than
the Names of Persons, of whom
no other Memory remains; that
which makes them most remark|able
<PB N="64" REF="39">
is, That they are writ in
the Ancient <HI>Gothic</HI> Language, and
the <HI>Runick</HI> Character.</P>
<P>The most Curious Piece of
Learning among them, is a
Translation of the Evangelists
into the <HI>Gothic</HI> Tongue, done a|bout
Twelve or Thirteen hun|dred
Years ago, by <HI>Ulphila,</HI> a
Bishop of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Thracia,</HI>
of which they have the sole
Ancient Manuscript Copy that
is known to be in the world.
Since the Reformation, <HI>Gustavus
Adolphus</HI> was the first great Pa|tron
Learning had in this Coun|trey,
by whom the Universities
that had been much impair'd,
were endow'd with tolerable Sa|laries
for Professors in most Sci|ences.
These his Daughter Queen
<HI>Christina</HI> somewhat augmented,
and by the Fame of her own
<PB N="65" REF="39">
Learning, and the favourable
Reception she gave to Scholars,
drew several Learned men from
abroad, that have left good Proofs
of their Abilities, and raised an
Emulation in the Natives, whose
best Performance is in the Hi|story,
Antiquities, and Ancient
Laws of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The University of <HI>Upsall</HI> con|sists
of a Chancellor, who is al|ways
a great Minister of State;
a Vice-Chancellor, always the
Archbishop; a Rector, chosen
out of the Professors, of whom
there are about Twenty that
have each 150 <HI>l.</HI> a Year Salary.
The ordinary Number of Stu|dents
is above Seven or Eight
hundred; Fifty of which are
maintain'd by the King, and
some few others were former|ly
<PB N="66" REF="40">
by Persons of Quality; the
rest, that cannot subsist of them|selves,
spend the Vacation in
gathering the Charity of the
Diocess they belong to, which
is commonly given them in
Corn, Butter, dry'd Fish or
Flesh, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon which they sub|sist
at the University the rest of
the Year. They live not Col|legiately,
but in Private Houses;
nor wear Gowns, nor observe
other Discipline, than what their
own Necessity or Disposition
leads them to.</P>
<P>The other University of <HI>Abo,</HI>
in <HI>Finland,</HI> is constituted in the
same manner, but less nume|rous
in Professors and Students.</P>
<P>There was a Third at <HI>Lunden</HI>
in <HI>Schonen,</HI> which, having been
interrupted by the late Wars,
is thought fit to be disconti|nued,
<PB N="67" REF="40">
because its Neighbourhood
to <HI>Denmark</HI> nourish'd in the Stu|dents
an Affection for that
Crown, to which that Province
formerly appertain'd; yet it is
again restor'd.</P>
<P>In each Diocess there is one
Free School, where Boys are fit|ted
for the University; and o|ther
trivial Schools, to which
Children are sent to learn to
Read, Write, and Sing their
Prayers; a Custom so universal,
that very few of them want this
degree of Education; and fur|ther
than that, such as are not
design'd for Studies, do very
seldom go, nor waste their
time in other needless Improve|ments.</P>
<P>Publick Provisions for the

not above Five or Six Hospi|tals

so much upon Interest, that
the Inclination of the Parties is
little regarded, nor the Nation
much troubled with the Extra|vagancies
of Lovers: Stealing
of Matches is scarce heard of in
an Age; nor can the Church
give License to Marry, without
Publication of the Banns: Per|sons

their Fortunes on both sides be|ing

till the Death of Relations, or
Advancement to Office, furnish
them with the Means of subsisting.
The Women, while young, have
generally Fair Complexions,
tolerable Features, and good
Shapes; and some of them are
accounted more eminent for Cha|stity
before Marriage, than Fi|delity
after; they are very fruit|ful,

Nature, Custom, or Necessity,
are inclin'd to be Obedient:
Divorces, and other Separations

Cousin-Germans may not

Solemnities, which are usu|ally
accompanied with more

Jollity and Feasting than befits the
Occasion; and to gain time to
make their Preparations, they
commonly Transport their Dead
to Vaults within, or adjoyning to
their Churches, where they remain
unburied some Months, and some|times
several Years; but of late
these, and other unnecessary Ex|pences

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Royal Family, and
Court of Sueden.</HEAD>
<P>CHARLES XI. the present
King of <HI>Sueden,</HI> was born
<HI>November</HI> the 25th, 1655. Two
years after his Father, <HI>Charles Gu|stave</HI>
X. of the House of <HI>Deux Ponts,</HI>
was advanced to the Crown, up
on the Abdication of Queen <HI>Chri|stina,</HI>
whose Cousin-German he
was, being the Son of <HI>Iohn Casimir,</HI>
Prince Palatine of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and
<HI>Catherine</HI> of <HI>Sueden,</HI> Daughter to
<HI>Charles</HI> IX. and Sister to <HI>Gustavus
Adolphus,</HI> Queen <HI>Christina</HI>'s Father.
This Kings Mother, Princess <HI>He|diwing
Eleonora,</HI> of the House of
<HI>Holstein,</HI> and Sister to the present
Duke, had no other Child, and
<PB N="74" REF="44">
upon the Decease of the King,
her Husband, in the year 1660.
was made <HI>Regent</HI> of the King|dom,
together with the five Great
Officers of the Crown, and held
that Post till the Year 1672. when
the King, her Son, was declared
Major, and took the Govern|ment.</P>
<P>His Majesties Education in his
Minority, by his own Genius,
and the Indulgence of his Mo|ther,
(if not by the contrivance
of the Principal Ministers) was
mostly in order to a Military
Life; in which Exercises, such
as Fencing, and Riding the Great
Horse, he took more pleasure,
and made better proficiency,
than in such Studies as requi|red
more intention of the mind.
Besides the <HI>Suedish</HI> and <HI>High-Dutch</HI>
Languages, which his Ma|jesty
learned in his Infancy, and
<PB N="75" REF="44">
speaks both equally well; he
was not perfected in any other,
having only a smattering of
<HI>French,</HI> to which he hath so great
an Aversion, that he will neither
own, nor be brought to speak
so much of it as he understands;
which want concurring with (if
not causing in him) a reserved
Temper, and backwardness to
Conversation with Strangers,
makes it more difficult for Foreign
Ministers to entertain his Majesty,
and himself uneasy upon their Ad|dresses.</P>
<P>None ever better conquered
this Difficulty, than Mr. <HI>Warwick,</HI>
who, having learned a little <HI>High-Dutch,</HI>
with which he enter|tain'd
his Majesty in ordinary
Discourse, without much mixture
of business, he thereby became
the Favourite Foreign Minister,
and had the Honour to be singled
<PB N="76" REF="45">
out by his Majesty on all occa|sions.</P>
<P>In the year 1674. his Majesty
was Crowned, and presently af|ter
engaged in a War that gain'd
him an eminent degree both of
Experience and Honour, having
never lost a Battle in which he was
Personally present.</P>
<P>At the Conclusion of the War,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1680. he married the Prin|cess
<HI>Ulrica Eleonora,</HI> Sister to the
King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> a Lady as E|minent
for Piety, Virtue, Wis|dom,
and all other Qualities,
truly Great and Noble, as for
her Birth and Extraction. These,
with her great Charity to the
Poor, and Liberality to all, have
gain'd her the Hearts of the
whole Nation, and surmounted
the Aversion they naturally have
to those of her Country. By
her his Majesty hath already had
<PB N="77" REF="45">
Seven Children; five Princes,
four of which are Dead; and
two Princesses, and has fair
hopes of a more numerous Is|sue.</P>
<P>The King is of a Middle
Stature, and well-set, his Hair
brown, of a healthful and vigo|rous
Constitution, and Sanguine
Complexion, never attacqued
with any Violent Sickness, but
what has been occasion'd by some
outward Accidents; of which
two especially have endanger|ed
his Life: one was in the
War, when his Majesty riding
on the Ice, it brake, and he fell
into the Water, which brought
him into a Fever, that he nar|rowly
escaped. The other hap|pened
by the fall off his Horse,
when he broke his Leg, and was
so ill treated by his Surgeons,
that besides the danger of his
<PB N="78" REF="46">
Life then, the effects of their
miscarriage, are still seen in his
Majesties halting. There have
happened to him two Accidents
more, which have impaired his
Strength, and it's fear'd may
shorten his Days. One was,
That at Hunting, Monsieur <HI>Wach|master</HI>
being in danger to be kill'd
by a Bear, the King was so ea|ger
to rescue him, that he broke
a Vein, and was then like to
have bled to Death, and since
hath been subject to bleeding up|on
any motion. The other was,
That his Majesty hath formerly
accustomed himself to ride Post
such long Stages, and with so
great speed, that he hath often
been near suffocated by the heat;
the expence of his Spirits, and the
Agitation of his Blood, whereof
the effects are still observed, and
feared by those about him.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="46">
He possesses many Excellent
and Princely Qualities, an Ex|emplary
Piety, and Religious Dis|position,
that shews its self in all
his Actions; and invincible Cou|rage,
that has oft exposed his Per|son
to great dangers, not only in
his Wars, but in his Divertise|ments.</P>
<P>His Chastity and Temperance
are very regular at least; if there
be any Instances of his failing in
the latter upon any extraordina|ry
Occasion or Entertainment,
he hath never been known, or
scarce suspected to violate the for|mer.</P>
<P>Frugality is practised by his
Majesty in a high degree, and
his Parsimonious Temper ap|pears
on all Occasions; that if
his Subjects think him too pres|sing
for Money, they have the
Satisfaction to see and believe that
<PB N="80" REF="47">
it is laid either out, or up for
their Good, not expended in
profuse Liberalities, or vain Di|vertisements,
to which his Ma|jesty
is a perfect Stranger; nei|ther
delighted with Plays, Ga|ming,
or any other Recreations,
besides Riding, Fencing, and Hunt|ing.</P>
<P>His peaceable Demeanour
may perhaps more justly be a|scribed
to the State of his Affairs,
than his own Nature, which
more powerfully inclines him
to the Fatigue of a Camp, than
the Ease of a Court; and suits
better with a Martial Familia|rity,
than the shews of Grandeur,
and the Solemnities of State.
The Cholerick Temper that hath
been incident to all his Ance|stors,
hath sometimes carried him
to low Expressions of his An|ger,
as well towards the greater
<PB N="81" REF="47">
as meaner sort of his Subjects;
but the fit is usually soon over,
and is recompenced by his pla|cability
and readiness to for|give
those that have offended
him.</P>
<P>His Respect to his Mother
seems to equal, if not exceed,
his Kindness to his Consort, who
hath the Satisfaction of his Con|stancy,
but little share in his Se|crets,
and not very much of his
Conversation, which he frequent|ly
bestows on the Queen-Mother,
and usually eats in her Apart|ment.</P>
<P>His Majesty's most diligent In|spection
into all the Affairs of
his Kingdom, besides that it
makes all his Ministers more cir|cumspect,
hath gain'd him a
great stock of Experience. The
smallest matters are not below
his notice, and nothing of any
<PB N="82" REF="48">
moment is concluded, before
he hath been consulted; this
is the Employment of all his
time, scarce any hour of the Day
passing from five in the Morning,
when he constantly rises, in which
business of one nature or other, is
not before him.</P>
<P>The Frugality of his Majesties
Temper, is every where visible
in his Court, in which there is
little regard had to Splendor and
Magnificence, either in Furniture,
Tables, or Attendants, or other
things of that Nature. The
Principal Officer of the Court, is
the Upper Marshal, formerly cal|led
the Marshal of the Kingdom,
which Office is now held by
Count <HI>Iohn Steenbeck;</HI> next to
him, are the Marshal and In|tendant
of the Court, with about
eight or ten that are stiled Gen|tlemen
of the Court, who wait
<PB N="83" REF="48">
at the King's Table. That which
makes the best Appearance, is the
Foot-Guards, which consist of
2200 Men, of which one Com|pany
is always in the Castle,
and the other in the other parts
of the City. The Collonel of
the Guards is next the King's
Person in all Publick Solemnities;
and the Captain that has the
Watch, lies in the Room next to
his Majesty's Bedchamber. There
is another Guard of 250 Men,
of which about ten at a time wait
on Foot with Halberts, and on
Horseback, when the King travels
in Ceremony.</P>
<P>Next to the King, the Queen-Mother
is ranked both in the Ad|dresses
of <HI>Foreign</HI> Ministers, and
on all other occasions.</P>
<P>She is a Princess of great Vir|tue
and Goodness, and would be
more esteemed, if she were not
<PB N="84" REF="49">
diverted from the Exercise of Li|berality,
by the Inclination she
has to Building, which she has
gratified in the Structure of a ve|ry
Magnificent House, about six
Miles from <HI>Stockholm;</HI> it has one
Front towards a great Lake, and
the other looks upon a Garden of
a Thousand Yards long, adorned
with very fine and choice Statues,
the Spoils of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
and a great number of <HI>Cas|cades,</HI>
that are supplied with ve|ry
good Water from an Eminence
about a Mile distant.</P>
<P>Her Court and Revenue is go|verned
by Count <HI>Charles Gylden|stern,</HI>
and next to him is the Mar|shal
of her Court, and other Of|ficers;
as also a Governess of the
Maids of Honour, who are six,
with other inferior Servants.</P>
<P>The Queen Consort, besides
what has already been said of
<PB N="85" REF="49">
her, is a great lover of Reading,
and together with the <HI>Northern</HI>
Languages, speaks <HI>French</HI> perfect|ly
well; she is of a Melancholy
Disposition, and lives very retired,
seldom stirring out of her own
Apartment, and that of the Prince
and Princesses.</P>
<P>The Elder Princess was born
in the Year 1681. And the Prince
in the Year following; both of a
delicate Constitution, of great
hopes, and Educated with much
care. The Younger Princess was
born <HI>Anno</HI> 1688.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of his MAJESTY'S Go|vernment.</HEAD>
<P>HIS Majesty was no sooner
Crowned, but he found
himself engaged in the War then
on foot; and espoused the <HI>French</HI>
Interest, in Consideration of a
Subsidy of 200000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, in
which the first Blow was the
Defeat of <HI>Feldt</HI> Marshal <HI>Wrangel,</HI>
and his Army in <HI>Germany;</HI> a
Disaster so little foreseen, or
provided for, that it made a
more easy way for all the Mi|series
that ensued upon it, and
gave the King more eminent Oc|casions
of shewing his Courage
in defence of his Kingdoms and
People; for as the Success of that
<PB N="87" REF="50">
Action turned the Byass of the
<HI>Danish</HI> Councels, and presented
the favourable opportunity they
expected, to engage in the War,
which they began with the sur|prizal
of <HI>Holstein,</HI> and the Ta|king
of <HI>Wismar,</HI> and thence tran|slated
it into <HI>Schonen;</HI> so that
when the King was called into
those Parts to make Head a|gainst
the <HI>Danes,</HI> he found the
effects of his Ministers Deficien|cy
in making due Preparations;
Four of the Six Fortified Places
of that Province being already
in the Enemies hands, and the
Inhabitants at liberty to express
their Affections for <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>To encounter these Difficul|ties,
and a more Potent Enemy,
assisted by more Powerful Con|federates,
the King at first had
but a Handful of Men, and
empty Magazines; the Forces
<PB N="88" REF="51">
of the Kingdom being scatter'd
into <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Leifland,</HI> the
Borders of <HI>Norway,</HI> and the
Sea-Service; from all which
places his Majesty received no|thing
but accounts of Losses
and Misfortunes; so that the
Fortune of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and all its
Ancient Glory, seem'd to be
confin'd to his Majesty's Person
and his little Army, with which
in the compass of One Year,
he won Three Pitch'd Battels;
and in one of them he is said
to have Charged Thirteen times
at the Head of a Brigade;
and yet, which is very remark|able,
doth value himself for not
having drawn the Blood of any
one man.</P>
<P>In the course of this War the
King gain'd a great Stock of
Military Experience, without a|ny
Tincture of those Vices that
<PB N="89" REF="51">
commonly prevail in a Camp;
and was so indefatigable, and
perpetually employed, that he
scarce had his Boots off in Three
Years time: The Streights he
was often reduced to, taught
him many excellent Lessons,
especially the Necessity of put|ting
the Kingdom into a better
Posture of Defence than he
found it: Besides, his Officers,
with the chief Ministers about
him, Baron <HI>Iohn Guldenstiern,</HI>
made it their business to possess
his Majesty with an ill opinion
of the Senate, and discovered
the Malversations that the Ru|ling
Lords had been guilty of
in his Minority; which sunk so
deep with him, that as his dis|pleasure
fell upon some of those
Lords during the War, and a
Slight upon them all, neither
communicating his Counsels,
<PB N="90" REF="52">
nor acquainting them with the
Success of his Actions, which
they were left to learn from
Passengers and Masters of Ships;
so after the Conclusion of the
Peace, and his return to <HI>Stock|holm</HI>
in the year 1680, his Ma|jesty
call'd together the States
of the Kingdom, and gave them
a Summary Account of the
State of Affairs during the War,
and the Issue of it, and propo|sed
to them to inspect the
Occasions of the great Losses
the Kingdom had sustain'd, to
find out means to deliver the
Government from the Streights
(or rather States) it laboured un|der,
and to consult for its further
Security.</P>
<P>The <HI>Odium</HI> of all the Losses
and Misfortunes of the War,
was easily fix'd upon the Mini|sters
that had managed Affairs
<PB N="91" REF="52">
in the King's Minority; and
therefore a Committee was cho|sen
out of the several Bodies
of the States, to enquire into
the Miscarriages and Evil Coun|sels
of those Ministers, and pass
Sentence upon the Delinquents:
And to this end the Registers of
the Council were examin'd, the
dammage arising from each Re|solution
computed, and every
Senator that had Voted therein
was charged with his Proportion
of it; and that with so much
Rigour, that their whole Estates
have not sufficed to make Sa|tisfaction:
To this the States al|so
found, that the Power the
Senators attributed to themselves,
had helped to produce these bad
effects, and therefore declared,
That as they the States needed
no such Mediators between the
King and them; so neither did
<PB N="92" REF="53">
they find, that the Article of
his Majesty's Coronation-Oath,
(in which he had promised to
rule the Kingdom with the Ad|vice
of the Senators) did oblige
him to think it necessary any
longer to have their Concur|rence
to any Counsels he thought
fit to take; or continue their
Salaries to more of them than
he was pleased to employ: Up|on
which several of them were
laid aside; and the rest, instead
of their former Title of Coun|sellors,
or Senators of the King|dom,
were stiled the King's
Counsellors; a Method which
perhaps in time may cost the
Crown dear, there being left
none to bear the Burthen between
the King and the Complainants.
And to give greater strength to
this, the States declared also,
That tho the Regents, during
<PB N="93" REF="53">
a Minority, might be called to
account for their Administrati|on;
yet his Majesty, who re|ceived
his Crown from God,
was only accountable to God
for his Actions, and tied by no
other Engagements than what
his Coronation-Oath imported;
namely, To rule the Kingdom
according to Law: Which Arti|cle
was further explain'd in the
following Convention.</P>
<P>To remedy the great Neces|sities
the Government was re|duc'd
to, and discharge the vast
Debts contracted in the War,
several very Important Conclu|sions
were made; for both a
very large Benevolence was grant|ed,
towards which every person
in the Kingdom that receiv'd
Wages paid the Tenth Pe|ny;
every whole Farm Five
Crowns, which is near as
<PB N="94" REF="54">
much as the usual Rent of those
Farms; and the Cities a propor|tionable
Contribution; and that
for Two Years, or if a War hap|ned,
for Four: And a Resolution
was taken to establish a New
Colledge of Reduction, with Pow|er
to reunite to the Crown all
such Lands, as by former Kings
had been alienated by way of
Donation, or sold at an under|value.</P>
<P>The Choice of the Members
of this Colledge, and the Par|ticulars
of their Instructions,
were left to his Majesty; the
States only prescribing some ge|neral
Bounds, and especially
providing, That of such Lands
as were to be reunited, the va|lue
of 70 <HI>l.</HI> a year should be left
to the Possessor.</P>
<P>The care of the future Secu|rity
of the Kingdom the States
<PB N="95" REF="54">
recommended to his Majesty,
praying him to make such an E|stablishment
of the Militia, and
Preparation of the Fleet and For|tresses,
as should appear need|ful:
So favourable was this Con|juncture
for the Advancement
of the King's Authority, that he
scarce needed to ask whatever
he desired; each Body of the
States striving which should out|bid
the other in their Conces|sions.
The Nobility and Gen|try,
who universally depend on
the King, as not being able to
subsist upon their own private
Fortunes, without some additio|nal
Office, were under a Neces|sity
to comply with every thing,
rather than hazard their present
Employments, or future Hopes
of Advancement; their Interest
therefore obliged them to keep
pace with the Officers of the Ar|my
<PB N="96" REF="55">
that sate in their House, and
some others of their Brethren, who
vigorously promoted the King's
Affairs.</P>
<P>The Clergy, Burghers, and
Peasants, were easily persuaded,
That the Miseries they had suffer|ed,
proceeded from the too great
Power of the Nobility; that the
King could never be too much
trusted, his Majesty having so oft
exposed his Life to the greatest
Dangers in Defence of his Sub|jects,
it was their Duty to make
all the grateful Returns they were
able; besides, they were glad of
an occasion of humbling the Nobi|lity,
who in Prosperity were al|ways
imperious, and concluded,
that the burthen falling upon
them, would redound to their own
ease.</P>
<P>These Dispositions of the Peo|ple,
added to the excessive Affe|ction
<PB N="97" REF="55">
they had for the King's Per|son,
from an Opinion of his Piety,
and Admiration of his Courage,
gave him an opportunity to lay
the Foundations of as <HI>Absolute a
Sovereignty,</HI> as any Prince in <HI>Europe</HI>
possesses. The Project of which
great Alteration, his Majesty (as
was supposed) received from Ba|ron
<HI>Iohn Gyldenstiern,</HI> a Minister of
Great Abilities, and as great an E|nemy
to the Senate: He had wait|ed
on the King in the War, and
drawn to himself the Management
of all weighty Affairs, and perhaps
expected to hold the same Post up|on
this Great Revolution, which in
the former Constitution he could
not hope&punc; but before this Assem|bly,
and soon after his return from
an Embassy in <HI>Denmark,</HI> he di|ed,
not without suspicion of Foul
play.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="56">
Upon these Foundations his
Majesty, after the Separation of the
States, set his Ministers earnestly to
work, and with an Unwearied Ap|plication
took Cognizance of their
Proceedings.</P>
<P>Foreign Affairs were committed
to Count <HI>Benedict Oxenstiern,</HI> Mon|sieur
<HI>Ehrenstien,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Oern|stedt,</HI>
persons of great Experience
and Abilities: The Count began
to be employ'd in Publick Affairs
at the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI> at which
he was for some time, and has since
been for the most part in Embas|sies;
especially in <HI>Germany,</HI> and
was then return'd from the Trea|ty
of <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where he had ('tis
said upon his Lady's account) en|tertain'd
a violent Aversion to
<HI>France;</HI> and being made President
of the Chancery in the room of
Count <HI>Magnus de la Gardie,</HI> who
was laid aside, he took care to give
<PB N="99" REF="56">
his Majesty the same Impressions,
laying before him how that Court,
by corrupting his Ministers, had
engag'd <HI>Sueden</HI> in the War, of
which his Majesty had felt the
miseries; and was forced to sit
down with the Loss of some Ter|ritories
in <HI>Germany,</HI> besides Forty
Sail of good Ships, and above
100000 men; all which might ei|ther
have been prevented or re|pair'd,
if <HI>France</HI> had not sacrific'd
<HI>Sueden</HI> to its own Interest: That
the Subsidy was rather distributed
by <HI>French</HI> Commissaries, and em|ploy'd
in their own Service, than
paid to his Majesty, who oft times
in his greatest need could not be
supplied out of that Fund: That
his Majesty could neither be Ma|ster
of his own Counsels, nor make
any tolerable Figure in <HI>Europe,</HI> so
long as he was esteemed a Pension|er
and a Mercenary.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="57">
These and the like Reasons mo|ved
the King to command each
Member of the Privy Council to
put in Writing what Measures they
thought advisable for him to take,
in relation to Foreign Affairs; in
which some of them argued very
warmly for <HI>France;</HI> but the Rea|sons
on the other side were more
prevalent with his Majesty, who
thereupon took such Resolutions
as produced the <HI>Guaranty</HI> League
with <HI>Holland,</HI> and other Counsels,
that <HI>Sueden</HI> has since pursu'd.</P>
<P>For the management of Affairs
at Home, his Majesty employed
Baron <HI>Claudius Flemingh,</HI> whose Fa|ther
having been ill used by the
Regents in the King's Minority,
had left him several Projects, that
fell in with the Designs on foot,
and enabled him to go through
with the Reduction of Crown-Lands,
being made President of
<PB N="101" REF="57">
that Colledge, and assisted with
a competent number of Assessors:
He began to examine the Titles
of those that held any Lands that
had formerly belonged to the
Crown; and where any such were
found to have been alienated by
way of Donation for pretended
Services, or were situated in for|bidden
places, (that is, within
Six miles of any of the King's
Castles) they were reunited to
the Crown without further di|spute;
the Value of 70 <HI>l. per An.</HI>
being reserved to the Possessor:
As to Crown-Lands that had been
sold, enquiry was made into the
nature of the Price, and the Real
Value of the Estate. Where Rea|dy
Money had been paid, the In|terest
of 5 <HI>per Cent.</HI> was allowed
for it; and if the Yearly Value
of the Estate exceeded that Inte|rest,
the said Overplus, and the
<PB N="100" REF="58">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="101" REF="58">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="102" REF="59">
Interest of it at 8 <HI>per Cent.</HI> from the
first Alienation, was computed,
and frequently made to amount
to as much as the Capital it self;
which being by that means satis|fied,
the Estate return'd to the
King. Where Lands had been gi|ven
in Payment of Arrears, there
no Interest was allow'd, the Ca|pital
being accounted unfruitful;
so that the Yearly Value of such
Lands, together with the Interest,
was deducted from the Principal;
which being soon eaten out, not
only the Lands return'd to the
King, but the Possessor also be|came
indebted to him; and he
was to accept it as an Act of Grace,
if his Majesty took the Lands, and
forgave the Debt.</P>
<P>By these Methods the King re|cover'd
a very great Revenue, tho
with the Impoverishing of most
Families in <HI>Sueden,</HI> and many of
<PB N="103" REF="59">
them, such whose Ancestors, and
themselves also had spent their
Lives and Fortunes in the Crown's
Service, which Considerations
could not be regarded, nor Ex|ceptions
made in favour of any in
particular, without adding to the
Discontents of all the rest, who
more patiently suffered, while the
Case was general.</P>
<P>The same Baron <HI>Flemingh</HI> was
also made president of the Trea|sury,
and of the Colledge of Li|quidation,
a Court erected not
only to be a Barrier to the Trea|sury,
and keep all Creditors off,
till their Accounts were first stated
and approved in that Colledge;
but his business was also to find
out such as were any ways in|debted
to the King, to form the
Charge against them, and de|mand
Payment, which was not
to be refused upon pretence (as
<PB N="104" REF="60">
it sometimes was the Case) that
the Party had greater Sums due
from the Crown, but the King's
Debt was to be paid first, and
without any delay, and the Party
left to State his Accounts after|wards
in the Colledge of Liqui|dation.
And wherein such Acts
were used towards many, by
making (as they call them) Ob|servations
upon the Price, the time
of delivering the Species of Mo|ney,
and the like, that several of
the King's Debts have been paid
without a farthing of Money, and
not a few Pretenders have thereby
been made Debtors to the King,
and payment extorted with great
Rigour.</P>
<P>The payment of the Fleet, his
Majesty committed to Baron <HI>Hans
Wachtmeister,</HI> (in the place of the
Great Admiral, Count <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">eenbeck</HI>)
who prevailed to have it removed
<PB N="105" REF="60">
from <HI>Stockholm,</HI> its ordinary Stati|on,
to a Harbor fortified for that
purpose in the Province of <HI>Bleak|ing,</HI>
and named <HI>Carlscrone,</HI> as be|ing
both nearer to <HI>Denmark,</HI> and
<HI>Germany,</HI> earlier free from Ice in
the Spring, and the Parts adja|cent
abounding with Timber.
In that, and other places, great
diligence was used, both to re|pair
the Old Ships, which amount|ed
not to Twenty Sail, and to
build New Ones, of which since
that time, about Twenty from
Eighty to Forty Guns; and Eight
or Ten of less force, have been
built by Two <HI>English,</HI> and other
Master builders.</P>
<P>The Establishment of the <HI>Mi|litia,</HI>
his Majesty made his own
peculiar Care, as having more
immediately felt the Effects of
the Disorder it had been in, and
learnt by Experience the necessity
<PB N="106" REF="61">
of such a Standing Force, as might
answer the ends of its Institu|tion.</P>
<P>In what manner his Majesty
proceeded herein, shall be shown
in another place.</P>
<P>In this interval, his Majesty
published several new Laws;
one against <HI>Duels,</HI> the substance
of which is already mentioned;
another to fix the Right of Pre|cedency
among the Nobility and
Officers; wherein next after the
Privy-Counsellors, the Soldiers
are principally considered; each
considerable Office, being rank|ed
according to its Dignity and
Precedency, determined accord|ing
to that Rank, without any
respect to Birth or Quality.</P>
<P>At the next Assembly of the
States in the Year 1683. besides a
benevolence equal to that grant|ed
the last Sessions, his Majesty
<PB N="107" REF="61">
obtained such farther Advantages,
as the ends he designed did re|quire;
for not only the <HI>Reunion</HI> of
the 70 <HI>l.</HI> a year reserved by the
former Session, was consented to,
and that without the least difficulty,
because those of the Nobi|lity
that had lost most, did there|by
revenge themselves of the Offi|cers
of the Army: And others, who
had been the great Sticklers in the
Reduction, by which themselves
had lost little or nothing, if the
Reservation of 70 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> had
stood; but the Article <HI>of ruling the
Kingdom according to Law,</HI> was al|so
further explained, and the
States declared, That his Majesty
was not thereby tied to the Laws
then in being, but might alter the
same, and add thereto such Con|stitutions,
as he thought most use|ful
for the present State of the
Kingdom; and that whatever In|structions
<PB N="108" REF="62">
he pleased to give any
Colledge or Officer, the same were
a Law to them, and all others that
they concerned, added only this,
That they hop'd his Majesty would
communicate to the States such
Laws as were of a general Nature,
and intended to be binding to the
whole Kingdom. And whereas his
Majesty had laid before the States,
the undue Proceedings of the
Ministers at his Father's Death,
whose <HI>Testament</HI> they rescinded,
and alter'd the Frame of the Go|vernment,
he had prescribed to
be observ'd in the King's Minori|ty;
the States declared, That
the Authors of those Alterations,
were no honest <HI>Patriots,</HI> and left
them to the King's Justice, pro|mising
that in case of his Majesty's
Decease, during his Successor's
Minority, they would see his Te|stament
punctually fulfilled, and
<PB N="109" REF="62">
the Form of Government thereby
prescribed, inviolably observed.</P>
<P>The next Assembly of the States
in 1686. renewed the usual Bene|volence
which was asked to enable
the King to pay his Debts, and
made some further Concessions in
the matter of the <HI>Re-union,</HI> rather
to take off the Odium from the
King and his Ministers, than to
add any Authority to his Majesty's
Proceedings.</P>
<P>These and the like Concessions,
have rendred his Majesty an <HI>Abso|lute
Monarch,</HI> to which his Subjects
submit without any contest; and
had not those other pressures that
accompanied it made it uneasy,
there would scarce have been
found in that Loyal Kingdom any
one Person disaffected to the Go|vernment;
but the loss of Estates,
they supposed to have right to, has
created Discontents in many of
<PB N="110" REF="63">
the Nobility and Gentry, and the
frequent and heavy Taxes impo|sed
by the States are no less sensi|ble
to those of inferior Degrees;
that perhaps the King of <HI>Sueden</HI>
has lost as much in the Affection
of his Subjects, as he has gain'd
in his Revenue; yet this is not
like to produce any bad Effects,
since the King knows so well how
to make himself obeyed, and
has such effectual means in his
hands, not only to restrain any
disorders, but to engage the great|est
part of the Nation to his In|terest.</P>
<P>For the Distribution of all Im|ployments
of any Value in the
Kingdom, belongs to his Maje|sty;
and the Nobility and Gen|try,
as well as others, are under
a greater necessity than ever, of
rendring themselves acceptable to
him, that they may get Employ|ments.
<PB N="111" REF="63">
Besides, his Majesty has
lately thought fit to cause all that
are in Office to renew their Oath
of Fidelity; the Tenor of which
has been accommodated to the
present Government. The In|structions
also of all Governors of
Provinces, and other, both Civil
and Military Officers, have been
revised and renewed: And as a
new Body of Laws Ecclesiastical
is already published; so the Com|mon
Laws of the Kingdom are
under Consideration, to be ren|dred
more plain, full, and suitable
to the present State of things, ac|cording
to the mind of the King,
and those that are his Advisers in
this Change; yet all this Power
and Provision is not by the Court
it self thought sufficient to keep
an Oppressed People from Disor|ders;
nor would it likely long do
so, if the King did not by great
<PB N="112" REF="64">
Applications and Deferences court
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and by no small de|grees
of Compliance with them,
not only in Ecclesiastical, but
even in Civil Affairs, cultivate
their Fidelity and Affection; and
this, because the <HI>Priests</HI> have ve|ry
great and uncontroulable Inte|rest
and Authority among the
Common People (who only can
make Disturbances) and can at
their pleasure inflame, or appease
them.</P>

Poll-Money, Tythes, Copper and
Silver-Mines, Proceedings at Law,
and other less considerable Particu|lars;
which are calculated in all to
near a Million of Pounds a Year;
of which the Lands make above
one Third, and the Customs almost
a Fourth. The Poll-money is paid
only by the Peasants, each of which
above Sixteen, and under Sixty,
pays about Twelvepence a year.</P>
<P>In the Treasury-Chamber, a
President (now Baron <HI>Fabian Wrede</HI>)
with Four Counsellors, and other
<PB N="122" REF="69">
Officers sit, and act as a Court of
Justice, in such matters as relate
to the King's Revenue; but they
make no Assignments, that being
the business of the <HI>Contoir</HI> of State,
in which the Commissary, in con|junction
with the President, di|spose
of all Payments, but yet not
without Orders immediately from
the King: At the beginning of
every Year they make a Calculati|on
of what is likely to come in,
and what will remain above the
ordinary Charge; which they lay
before his Majesty, and receive
his Orders what Debts shall first be
paid. The greatest part of the
King's Money passes through the
Bank, and thereby saves the
Charge of Officers, to recieve and
pay it, there being between the
<HI>Contoir</HI> of State, and the Bank, on|ly
one <HI>Rent-master</HI> (as they stile
him) who keeps account with
<PB N="123" REF="69">
them both, and gives Assignments
according to the Orders he re|cieves.</P>
<P>The Revenue is supposed at pre|sent
to exceed the ordinary Charge
of the Crown; and the King ha|ving
lately had three several ex|traordinary
Contributions, and
vast Forfeitures from the Faulty
Ministers of State, as also great
Advantages in recovering the
Debts due to the Crown, would
have his Coffers well fill'd, if the
Building of Ships, and paying of
Debts contracted in the last War,
had not drain'd them in some mea|sure.
In 1686 it was told the
States in the King's Name, That
in Six Years time his Majesty had
paid Debts to above Two Milli|ons
of Pounds (tho many of them
were paid with little Money), be|sides
the Building of about Thir|ty
Ships: And yet 'tis generally
<PB N="124" REF="70">
believed, the King is not ill provi|ded
with Ready Cash; and there
is great necessity for such Provisi|on,
to supply any pressing occasi|on,
since the Credit of <HI>Sueden</HI> is
very low Abroad; and at Home
the ordinary Taxes are so high,
that the people cannot long fur|nish
any Additional and Extraor|dinary
Assistances; that as the
Crown has resumed all former
Liberalities, and with Rigour ex|acted
its utmost Right, so it must
chiefly depend upon those Funds,
little being to be expected from
the People, and no Credit from
Abroad in case of Extremity,
since those that have formerly
trusted the Crown, have been so
very ill used; and neither the
States of the Kingdom, if they
should interpose their Engage|ments,
are in a condition to make
them good; nor can any Depen|dance
<PB N="125" REF="70">
be made upon the Security
either of the Crown-Lands, or
any other Branch of the Revenue,
since the late Resumption of those
Lands, and Revocation of such
Securities, have destroy'd all fu|ture
Faith.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Forces of Sueden.</HEAD>
<P>THE Reputation gain'd, and
the Conquests made by
<HI>Sueden</HI> in this and the last Age,
has not so much been owing to
its Native Strength, as to <HI>Foreign</HI>
Assistance of <HI>Germans, French, Eng|lish,</HI>
and especially <HI>Scots,</HI> of whom
they have used great Numbers in
all their Wars with <HI>Moscovy, Po|land,
Germany,</HI> and <HI>Denmark;</HI> and
by them the Art of War and Mi|litary
Discipline has been by de|grees
introduced into this Nation,
that in former times had only the
advantage of Courage and Num|bers;
for tho the <HI>Original Constitution</HI>
of the Countrey, and its Division
into Hundreds and other larger
Portions, that still retain <HI>Mili|tary</HI>
Names, seems to have been
<PB N="127" REF="71">
the work of Armies, and the fre|quent
Expeditions of the <HI>Goths,</HI> and
other Inhabitants of these parts,
shew, That in all Ages they were
addicted to War and Violence; yet
it was in a disorderly and tumultu|ous
manner; their Infantry always
consisting of unexperienced Pea|sants,
raised for the occasion, and
disbanded as soon as it was over.
The <HI>Feudal</HI> Laws indeed (which are
supposed to have had their Birth a|mongst
these people) provided for
a competent Number of Cavalry,
all Estates of the Nobility and Gen|try
being held by Knights Service;
and while the Kingdom was <HI>Ele|ctive,</HI>
the Kings were bound to
maintain some Forces of Horse out
of the Revenues of the Crown; but
this Establishment had been in a
great measure corrupted, and
the Kingdom so shatter'd with
<HI>Domestick</HI> Broils, that it made a
<PB N="128" REF="72">
very inconsiderable Figure; and
was little known in <HI>Europe,</HI> till
the Crown became <HI>Hereditary,</HI>
and the Interest of the Royal
Family concerned in the Strength
and Prosperity of the Nation:
Since that time the Standing
Forces of the Kingdom have
been augmented, yet not so ef|fectually
established as its neces|sities
required; for it generally
happened, that the Nobility and
Gentry were so backward in fit|ting
out their Horse, and the Le|vies
of Foot not being to be made
without the consent of the Peasants
in the Assembly of the States, it
was so hardly obtain'd, that the
Regiments were very thin, and Re|cruits
extreme difficult; nor were
the Officers Salaries so punctually
paid, as to enable them to be in
readiness on all occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="72">
To remedy these Inconvenien|ces,
the present King, on whom
the States had conferr'd an <HI>Abso|lute
Power,</HI> to put the <HI>Militia</HI> into
such a Method as he should think
fit, has made such Regulations in
all the Particulars relating to this
Matter; as were requisite to bring
it to Perfection.</P>
<P>The new <HI>Injunctions</HI> he has
made about the <HI>Cavalry,</HI> that the
Nobility and Gentry furnish, are
so exact, that 'tis not in their pow|er
to put either the Man or the
Horse that are once Listed, to o|ther
Employments than what are
there specified, but must have
them in a continual Readiness,
whenever they are call'd upon,
with such Arms and Equipage, as
his Majesty hath directed. In de|fault
of which, severe Penalties
are inflicted, and the Estates they
hold by that Service subject to
Confiscation.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="73">
For the <HI>Infantry,</HI> the King has
taken the like Care; and whereas,
formerly no Levies could be made
but by <HI>Consent</HI> of the States, and
that but by small parcels at a time,
and with such disturbance, that
on those occasions 'twas usual for
half the Peasants to run into the
Woods, and other hiding places
to escape being made Soldiers This
has been remedied by the King's
Commissioners, who have distri|buted
the <HI>Infantry</HI> of each Pro|vince
proportionably to the Num|ber
of Farms, each of which of
the Value of about 60 or 70 <HI>l.</HI> a
Year (not being appropriated to
the Officers or other peculiar Ser|vices)
is charged with one Foot
Soldier, who receives from the
Farmer, Dyet, Lodgings, ordi|nary
Cloaths, and about Twenty
Shillings a Year in Money; or else,
a little Wooden House is built for
<PB N="131" REF="73">
him at the Farmer's Charge, who
must also furnish him with as
much Hay, as will keep a Cow
in Winter, and Pasturage in Sum|mer,
and Plow and Sow for him
such a parcel of Ground as will
afford him Bread; they that are
marry'd, (as many of them are,)
generally accept this latter Condi|tion;
the unmarried Soldiers usu|ally
abide with the Farmer, but
are not bound to do him any Ser|vice
without Wages; when they
have once taken the Peasants Mo|ney,
and are Listed in the King's
Service, they can never quit so
long as they are able to serve, and
if they desert, are punished with
Death: The first Institution of
this Method was very burdensome
to the Peasants, who were at great
Charge to hire their Men, which
cost them 10 and sometimes 20 <HI>l.</HI>
apiece, and the same they must
<PB N="132" REF="74">
do whenever their Soldier dies.
This in peaceable times will not
be so chargeable, as it is in times
of War; when Men will be un|willing
to serve, and Recruits
more frequently needed; and as
this is part of the Project hitherto
unexperienced, so most believe it
will be found very difficult, if not
impracticable.</P>
<P>As all the common Soldiers are
thus provided for at the Country's
Charge, so all Officers both of
Horse and Foot are maintained
by the King, who hath appropria|ted
so much of the Lands lately
<HI>reunited,</HI> or formerly belonging
to the Crown, to that purpose.
So that every Officer has a con|venient
House, and competent
Portion of Land to live upon, sci|tuate
in that part of the Country,
where the Regiment he belongs
to is quartered; as also the Rent
<PB N="133" REF="74">
of so many other Farms as make
up his pay, (which tho' it be some|what
less than formerly,) yet be|ing
punctually paid either in Mo|ney,
Corn or other Comodities,
they find it more profitable, than
when they were to solicite for it
at the Treasury.</P>
<P>A Colonel of <HI>Foot</HI> has, of these
Lands the yearly Rent of about
300 <HI>l.</HI> and the rest proportion|ably,
which amounts to about
2500 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, for all the Offi|cers
both upper and under, of
one Foot Regiment. And there
being in <HI>Sweden, Finland</HI> and <HI>Lief|land</HI>
28 Regiments of Foot, un|der
this Establishment the Main|tenance
of all the Officers belong|ing
to them, costs the King about
70000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year; what Charge
the Cloathing of the common Sol|diers
once in two or three Years,
their Arms and such other Neces|saries
<PB N="134" REF="75">
may put the King to, can|not
be so easily computed.</P>
<P>The Officers of <HI>Horse</HI> are pro|vided
for after the same manner
with such large Allowance as is
requisite. There are Fifteen Re|giments
of <HI>Horse</HI> thus established,
and the Maintenance of their Offi|cers
is computed to be about
80000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, all which arises
from the Rents of Crown Lands,
as do also the Wages of <HI>Civil</HI> Of|ficers
in the Country, who have
Farms annex'd to their Employ|ments,
in the same manner as the
<HI>Militia.</HI></P>
<P>The Laws the King hath made
for maintaining this Constitution
are every exact and particular,
and provide with great Caution,
that neither the Peasants shall be op|press'd,
nor the Lands and Houses
ruin'd; to which end all such
Lands are yearly visited, and the
<PB N="135" REF="75">
Possessor compell'd to make such
Repairs as are found needful;
and as every Officer upon his first
coming to such an Estate, sub|scribes
an Inventory of it, so upon
Advancement he cannot take Pos|session
of another Charge, till he
hath put that Estate into as good
a Condition as he found it, and
in case of Death his Heirs cannot
inherit, till that be done.</P>
<P>In times of Peace, all Trespasses
and Crimes comitted by the Sol|diery
fall ordinarily under the
Cognizance of a Civil Magistrate,
who has the same Authority over
them, as over the rest of the
King's Subjects, except when they
are encamped, or in Garrison, or
any way under <HI>flying Colours;</HI> in
all which Cases, as also in all Mat|ters
that relate solely to their Pro|fession,
their Officers have Juris|diction
over them, without whose
<PB N="136" REF="76">
leave a private Soldier is not per|mitted
to lodge out of his Quar|ters,
nor be absent a day from the
Parish he belongs to; the infe|rior
Officers cannot be absent from
their Charge, but by the Colonel's
Permission, nor Captains and
those above them without the
King's leave; and the good Effect
of the Officers constant Residence,
upon their respective Charges,
appears in the quiet and peace|able
Behaviour of the Soldiers,
who have not hitherto broke out
into any Enormities, nor given the
common People any great occasi|on
of complaint.</P>
<P>To keep them in Discipline,
each Company meets, and is ex|ercised,
once a Month, and every
Regiment once or twice a Year,
at which times only they wear the
the Kings's Cloaths, which at their
return, are carefully laid up in the
Churches.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="76">
For their Government in time
of War the King hath lately caused
the Articles of War to be reviewed
and printed, together with a new
Establishment of Courts Marshal,
and Instructions for the <HI>Auditors
General,</HI> and other Officers con|cern'd
in the Ministration of Ju|stice.</P>
<P>And for his Majesty's Informa|tion
on all occasions, a Book hath
been lately made, specifying the
Names of every Military Officer in
the King's Army, the time when
they first came into the Service,
and by what Steps they have <HI>risen,</HI>
by which means at one view, his
Majesty knows the Merit and Ser|vices
of any Officer.</P>
<P>The Forces in <HI>Pomerania</HI> and
<HI>Bremen,</HI> as also the Regiment of
<HI>Foot</HI> Guards are not under this
Establishment, but are paid in Mo|ney.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="77">
The whole Body of the King
of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Forces, according to
the best and most exact Account,
is as follows:</P>
<P>The establish'd Militia
in <HI>Sweden, Finland</HI> and
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Liefland</HI> are, Men</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cavalry 15 Regiments, is 17000</ITEM>
<ITEM>Infantry 28 Regiments, is 35000</ITEM>
<ITEM>Foot Guards Regiment, 2000</ITEM>
<ITEM>Forces in <HI>Pomeren</HI> and <HI>Bre|men</HI>
6 Regiments, is 6000</ITEM>
<ITEM>In all, 50 Regiments, 6000</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Each Regiment ordinarily con|sists
of 1200 Men (but some of
more) of which 96 are Officers;
and such care is taken to keep
them compleat, that it very sel|dom
happens, that 20 Men at a
time are wanting in a Regiment;
and as they are always in a readi|ness,
so a great Body of them may
quickly be brought together, e|specially
towards the Borders of
<PB N="139" REF="77">
<HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> where in
twenty Days time the King of
<HI>Sueden</HI> can have an Army of
20000 Men.</P>
<P>Above the ordinary Establish|ment
the King hath annex'd to
each Regiment about twenty su|pernumerary
Farms, to answer
any extraordinary Accidents of
Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to furnish a Subsi|stence
for such Officers, as are past
Service.</P>
<P>For common Soldiers that Age
or Wounds have rendred unfit for
War, there is one general Hospi|tal,
which has a good Revenue,
and besides that, every Officer
that is advanced, pays to it a Sum
of Money proportionable to the
Charge he arises to. A Colonel
pays 100 Crowns, and others in
proportion.</P>
<P>Besides the Arms in the Hands
of the <HI>Militia,</HI> there is a conside|rable
<PB N="140" REF="78">
Magazine at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> and
another at the Castle of <HI>Ienco|pingh</HI>
towards the Borders of <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
and these, as occasion serves,
are furnish'd from a considerable I|ron-work
at <HI>Oerbro</HI> in <HI>Nervia</HI> which
is continually employed in making
Arms of all sorts. In the Castle of
<HI>Iencopingh</HI> a Train of Artillery
stand always in readiness. This is the
sole <HI>Inland</HI> Fortress in <HI>Sueden,</HI>
which less needs such Artificial
Strengths, as well for other Rea|sons,
as because Nature in very
many places has provided it with
such Passes, as that a handful of
Men may defend against a great
Army.</P>
<P>On the Borders of <HI>Norway,</HI> be|side
some small Forts, that keep
the Passages over the Mountains,
there is the Castle of <HI>Bahunz</HI> sci|tuate
upon a Rock in the midst of
a deep River, but overlookt by the
Rocks near it.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="78">
The City of <HI>Gottenburgh</HI> is a
well fortified place, but wholly
Commanded by the Neighbour|ing
Hills.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Marstrand,</HI> and
the Castle of <HI>Elfsburgh</HI> lie towards
the Sea: on that side towards
<HI>Denmark</HI> are <HI>Waerburgh, Halmstad,
Landscrone</HI> and <HI>Malmo,</HI> places of
good defence. Upon the <HI>Baltick</HI>
Shoar are <HI>Carlescrone</HI> and <HI>Calmar,</HI>
with two small Forts at the en|trance
of the River leading to
<HI>Stockholm.</HI> The <HI>Northern</HI> parts are
covered with <HI>Lapland,</HI> the Bor|ders
of <HI>Finland</HI> towards <HI>Russia</HI> with
vast Woods and <HI>Morasses,</HI> and in
some parts with Castles and Forts.
In <HI>Liefland,</HI> besides <HI>Riga, Revell</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade of Sueden.</HEAD>
<P>THO' <HI>Sueden</HI> has in all Times
furnisht <HI>Europe</HI> with those
necessary Comodities it abounds
with, yet either the Warlike Tem|per,
the Idleness or Ignorance of
the Inhabitants, has formerly kept
them from being much concern'd
in Trade, and given Strangers
the Management and Advantage
of it, which for a long time, the
<HI>Hans</HI> Towns scituate on the <HI>Bal|tick</HI>
Sea, monopolized, till the
Seven Provinces of the <HI>Netherlands</HI>
were Erected into a <HI>Republick,</HI> and
became Sharers with them: Before
that time very little Iron was
made in <HI>Sueden,</HI> but the Oar, be|ing
<PB N="143" REF="79">
run into Pigs, was carried to
<HI>Dantzick,</HI> and other Parts of <HI>Prus|sia,</HI>
and there forged into Bars;
for which reason the Country
Smiths in <HI>England</HI> call Foreign I|ron
<HI>Dansk</HI> or <HI>Spruce</HI> Iron. The
Nation owes the greatest Improve|ments
it has made in Trade to
the Art and Industry of some in|genious
Mechanicks, that the Cruel|ty
of the Duke <HI>de Alva</HI> drove
into these parts: their Success in|vited
great Numbers of <HI>Reformed
Waloons</HI> to transplant thither,
whose Language and Religion re|mains
in the places they settled in,
where they erected Forges and
other Conveniences for making of
Iron Guns, Wire, and all other
Manufactures of Copper, Brass,
and Iron which for the most part
are still carried on by their Po|sterity.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="80">
The <HI>Suedish</HI> Navigation was
very inconsiderable, till Queen
<HI>Christina</HI> at the Conclusion of the
War in 1644. obtained from <HI>Den|mark</HI>
a Freedom from Customs
for all Ships, and Goods belong|ing
to <HI>Suedish</HI> Subjects, in their
Passage thro' the <HI>Sound,</HI> and esta|blisht
in her own Dominions that
difference in Customs that still
subsists between <HI>Suedish</HI> and <HI>Fo|reign</HI>
Ships, and is in proportion
of 4, 5, 6, the first called <HI>Whole|free,</HI>
the second <HI>Half,</HI> and the last
<HI>Vnfree,</HI> so that where a whole
free <HI>Suedish</HI> Ship pays 400
Crowns, half free pays 500, and
a <HI>Foreign</HI> Vessel 600.</P>
<P>But as great as this Advantage
was, it had but little effect, till
the <HI>English</HI> Art of Navigation
bridled the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and open|ed
the Intercourse between <HI>Eng|land</HI>
and <HI>Sueden.</HI> Since that time
<PB N="145" REF="80">
their Commerce has been much
augmented, as well as ours that
way, and Goods transported by
both, or either Party according to
the various junctures of Affairs.
When <HI>Sueden</HI> has been engaged in
a War, the <HI>English</HI> Ships have had
the whole Employ; but in times
of Peace, the Advantage is so
great on the <HI>Suedish</HI> side, and
Merchants so much encouraged by
Freedom in Customs to employ
their Ships, that <HI>English</HI> Bottoms can|not
be used in that Trade, but only
while <HI>Sueden</HI> is unprovided with
a number of Ships sufficient for
the Transportation of their own
Commodities; whether it be feasi|ble
to lay a Duty upon <HI>Suedish</HI>
Ships, importing Goods into <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
proportionable to what is
laid upon <HI>Foreign</HI> Vessels there, or
whether the Matter be of so great
Importance as to merit such a Re|solution,
<PB N="146" REF="81">
does not belong to this
Discourse to determine.</P>
<P>The chief Commodities <HI>Sueden</HI>
vends, are Copper, Iron, Pitch,
Tar, Masts, Deals, and Wooden
Ware, (besides the Commodities
exported from <HI>Liefland</HI>) to the
value of about 700000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year,
in return of which they receive
from abroad Salt, Wines, and
Brandy, Cloth, Stuffs, Tobacco,
Sugar, Spices, Paper, Linnen, and
several other sorts of Goods which
are supposed commonly to bal|lance
their Exportations, and some|times
exceed them.</P>
<P>Their Trade to <HI>Portugal</HI> for
Salt is accounted most necessary,
as without great quantities of
which they cannot subsist. That
with <HI>England</HI> is more beneficial,
because it takes off almost half their
own Commodities, and brings in
near two thirds of Money for one
<PB N="147" REF="81">
of Goods. The worst is their
<HI>French</HI> Trade, in regard it rather
supplies their Vanities, than Ne|cessities,
and gives little or no
vent to the Commodities of the
Country.</P>
<P>The general Direction of their
Trade belongs to the Colledge of
Commerce, which consists of the
President of the Treasury, and
Four Councellors, who hear Causes
of that nature, and redress any Dis|orders
that happen. The Bank at
<HI>Stockholm</HI> is of great benefit to
Trade, as well in regard that the
King's Customs for that City are
paid in there, as also that the
Merchants ordinarily make Pay|ments
to each other by Bills drawn
upon it, which eases them of a
great Trouble in Transporting
their Money from place to place,
that would otherwise be very dif|ficult
and chargeable. This Bank
<PB N="148" REF="82">
is well constituted, and was in
very good Credit, whilst it had
the States of the Kingdom for its
Guarrantees, of which it has now
but the Shadow; those States be|ing
(and are now stiled) the Kings
(not Kingdoms) States so that all
its Foundation derives now from
the Will and Pleasure of the King,
which may on several occasions
diminish not only its own Suffi|ciency,
but also the Confidence of
those that make use of it. The
Management of the Trade of
<HI>Sueden</HI> has always in the main been
in the Hands of Strangers, most
of the Natives wanting either Ca|pacity
or Application, and all of
them Stocks to drive it; for with|out
Credit from abroad, they are
not able to keep their Iron-works
going: and therefore at the be|ginning
of Winter, they usually
make Contracts with the <HI>English,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="82">
and other Foreigners, who then
advance considerable Sums, and
receive Iron in Summer; Were it
not for this necessity, Foreign
Merchants would have but little
Encouragement, or scarcely Per|mission
to Live and Trade amongst
them, and even as the Case stands,
their Treatment of them is as ri|gorous,
as in any Country, occa|sioned
chiefly by the Envy of the
Burghers, who cannot with any
Patience see a Stranger thrive a|mong
them. This is less sensible
to <HI>Hollanders</HI> and others, many of
whom become Burghers, and the
rest by their near way of Living
are less subject to <HI>Envy,</HI> but is
more especially the Case of the
<HI>English</HI> Merchants, who find it
not their Interest to become Bur|ghers,
and usually live somewhat
too high.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="83">
The Interest of <HI>England</HI> in the
Trade of <HI>Sueden</HI> may be compu|ted,
by the Necessity of their Com|modities
to us, and the vent of
ours there; their Copper, Iron,
Tar, Pitch, Masts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cannot be
had elsewhere, except from <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
whence it has been supposed
such Supplies may be furnished;
and if so, this Consideration ought
in reason to have an Influence on
the <HI>Suedish</HI> Councels, and engage
them to make the <HI>English</HI> Trade
with them as easie as possible, that
the Merchants be not driven upon
new Designs.</P>
<P>As to our Importations thither,
it has already been said, that they
scarce amount to one third of
what we export from thence, and
consist chiefly of Cloth, Stuffs,
and other Woollen Manufactures,
of which has been formerly vend|ed
yearly there to the value of
<PB N="151" REF="83">
about 50000 <HI>l.</HI> besides these, To|bacco,
<HI>New-Castle</HI> Coals, Pewter,
Lead, Tin, Fruits and Sugar, with
several other of our Commodities
are sold at this Market; as also
good quantities of Herrings from
<HI>Scotland,</HI> with other of their
Wares, that in all we are suppo|sed
to vend Goods to about
100000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year, whereof if any
more than half be paid for, it is
extraordinary. But the making
of Cloth in <HI>Sueden</HI> to supply the
Army, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which has been for|merly
endeavoured without Suc|cess,
being now encouraged and
assisted by the Publick, and un|dertaken
by some <HI>Scots</HI> and o|thers,
has of late, and does now
prove a great hindrance to the
Vent of our Cloth there. And
to favour this Undertaking, <HI>Eng|lish</HI>
Cloth is now, (unless it be
such finer Cloths as cannot be
<PB N="152" REF="84">
made here) clogg'd with such ex|cessive
Duties, as render the Impor|tation
of it impracticable. These
Undertakers have got Workmen
from <HI>Germany,</HI> and some from
<HI>England,</HI> and besides the <HI>German</HI>
Wool they use, they receive great
quantities from <HI>Scotland</HI> (supposed
to be practiced out of <HI>England</HI>)
without which they cannot work.
Yet as at present, the <HI>English</HI>
Trade in <HI>Sueden,</HI> is of the Impor|tance
above mentioned, notwith|standing
the Abatements aforesaid,
it is however considerable, and
will be so, while their Commodities
continue to be necessary, and those
that are concern'd in it, will de|serve
as they need, Protection and
Encouragement.</P>
<P>The last Treaty of Commerce
between the Two Nations expired
several Years ago; and that of an
older Date neither suits the pre|sent
<PB N="153" REF="84">
State of Things, nor has
been thought by the <HI>Suedes</HI> to sub|sist;
tho' now for their own In|terest
they insist upon the con|trary,
accordingly their Treatment
of the <HI>English</HI> is only in reference
to their own convenience. And
as the Subject of former Com|plaints
still remains, so new Bur|thens
are frequently imposed up|on
them: Sometimes they have
demanded of Merchants that were
leaving the Country, a sixth part
of the Estate they had got in it,
and arrested their Effects on that
account. And besides others, that
more directly concern their Trade,
the quartering of Soldiers, and
paying of Contributions has been
exacted for some Years, and some|times
the <HI>English</HI> forced to sub|mit
to it.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="85">
In the Year 1687. upon their
Petition to the King, for redress
of these Impositions which were
than laid very high, upon some
above 50 <HI>l.</HI> upon others 40, 30,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> besides that such of them as
kept House had Soldiers quarter|ed
upon them, some 3, 6, or 8.
In answer to their Petition, a <HI>Pla|caet</HI>
was publish'd, declaring that
they should be exempt from those
Payments; but withal, that no <HI>Fo|reign</HI>
Merchant should continue
to Trade in <HI>Sueden</HI> above Two
Months in a Year, unless he would
become a Burgher. In pursuance
of which Resolution their Ware|houses
were shut up for some time,
and the <HI>Suedes</HI> seem resolved to
proceed to extremity; but have
not put that Resolution generally
in Execution, tho' they seem to
wait for an Opportunity, and now
and then they try it upon particu|lar
<PB N="155" REF="85">
Persons, to see how Foreign
Princes will take it.</P>
<P>The Law that exacts the third
part of such <HI>Foreign</HI> Merchants
Estate, as die in <HI>Sueden,</HI> has not
in effect been so beneficial to the
<HI>Suedes,</HI> as frightful to the Mer|chants,
who (especially the <HI>Eng|lish</HI>)
for that and other reasons,
never think of marrying, and
settling there, so long as their
Affairs are in good order, and
they in a Condition to return home
with a competent Estate and Cre|dit;
upon which account <HI>Eng|land</HI>
seems to be less concern'd to
endeavour the repeal of that Law,
it being more useful to have <HI>Sue|den</HI>
a Nursery for young Mer|chants,
than a place of Settlement
for those that have got Estates.</P>

<P>THE ancient Expeditions of
the <HI>Goths,</HI> and the King|doms
they erected in <HI>France, Spain,
Italy</HI> and elsewhere, upon the
Ruins of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, have
little Connexion with the present

shews, that their Nation was then
much more populous and power|ful,
than it has been in latter
times, which is generally ascribed
to the use of <HI>Polygamy</HI> among
them, while they were Heathens;
but the Conquests which continue
to be beneficial to <HI>Sueden</HI> at this
day are of a much later Date.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="86">
For it was not till the Year 1560.
that the <HI>Suedes</HI> got footing in
<HI>Liefland,</HI> When the <HI>Knights Tem|plers,</HI>
who were Masters of those
Parts, being overthrown by the
<HI>Muscovites,</HI> King <HI>Erick</HI> of <HI>Sueden</HI>
was invited by the Inhabitants of
<HI>Revell,</HI> and the Country adjacent,
to take them into his Protection,
which he consented to; and the
Door being thus opened, the
Crown of <HI>Sueden</HI> has by degrees
wrested from the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Mus|covites</HI>
the greatest part of <HI>Lief|land,</HI>
and some Provinces of <HI>Rus|sia</HI>
adjoyning to it; Countries of
inestimable value to <HI>Sueden,</HI> as,
which both cover it from the In|cursions
of the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Musco|vites,</HI>
and furnish it with plentiful
Supplies of Corn and other Com|modities;
besides the Benefit it
reaps by the vast Trade of those
Parts. On the side of <HI>Denmark,</HI>
<PB N="158" REF="87">
besides <HI>Yempterland</HI> and <HI>Hercadale,</HI>
Two Northerly Provinces lying
opposite to <HI>Norway,</HI> they have
recovered the rich Countries of
<HI>Schonen, Halland</HI> and <HI>Blecking,</HI>
which joyn to the Body of <HI>Sueden;</HI>
and gave the <HI>Danes,</HI> while they
possess'd them, free entrance into
the very Heart of the Country.
They have also got from the

which prevents all Inroads from
that side of <HI>Norway.</HI> These, to|gether
with the Countries of <HI>Po|merania</HI>
and <HI>Bremen,</HI> are so consi|derable,
that their Writers own,
that the present Royal Family hath
augmented the Kingdom near one
half; only with this Disadvantage,
that all the Neighbours of <HI>Sueden</HI>
are thereby disobliged, and watch
all opportunities to retrieve their
Losses; so that <HI>Sueden</HI> can never
firmly depend upon the Friendship
<PB N="159" REF="87">
of <HI>Denmark, Poland, Muscovy,</HI> or
any other Neighbouring Princes.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="16" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Interest of Sueden.</HEAD>
<P>THE great Domestick In|terest
of <HI>Sueden</HI> has been
of late thought to consist in the
Advancement of the King's Re|venue,
and Authority at home,
in order to make him more for|midable
abroad; so that the Na|tion
has had no Interest distinct
from the King's; as the King on
the other side would seem to have
an inseparable Connexion with
the Prosperity of his Subjects in
general, and most especially of
the Yeomanry, or Peasants, who
are accounted the <HI>Basis</HI> of the
<PB N="160" REF="88">
Kingdom, rather than the Trading
part; therefore tho' the Peasants
have not been spared from bear|ing
a considerable Share of the
common Burthen; yet more care
has been taken to make it sit easie
upon them, than upon the rest,
and they delivered from the Op|pression
of the Fellow Subjects,
which they formerly laboured un|der:
the Encouragement of Trade
and Manufactures is also the King's
Care, and great Wonders are ex|pected
from it; but doubtless there
is much more in their Imaginati|ons,
than will ever be found in
the Effect.</P>
<P>It is also found the King's In|terest
to keep the Nobility and
Gentry very low. In Matters of
Religion his Majesty has no other
Interest than to maintain the pre|sent
Establishment, and keep the
<HI>Clergy</HI> to the due Performance of
<PB N="161" REF="88">
their Duty, which admits of little
or no difficulty.</P>
<P>In general the chief Domestick
Interest of the King of <HI>Sueden</HI> is
to preserve the Government in its
present State, and secure it such
to his Successors, it being consti|tuted
so much to the Advantage
of the Royal Family, that in that
regard it can hardly be bettered
by any Change.</P>
<P>In relation to <HI>Foreign</HI> Affairs, it
is apparently the Interest of <HI>Sue|den</HI>
to avoid all <HI>offensive</HI> War, as
being already in the quiet Posses|sion
of as many conquer'd Pro|vinces
on all sides as it can well
defend; tho' more would not
displease them, if they could be
got with safety, to maintain a
good Correspondence with <HI>Mos|covy</HI>
by a due Observation of the
Treaty lately concluded, and en|deavour
to end the Point of Sepa|ration
<PB N="162" REF="89">
of the Limits, which is the
only Matter that can be like to
create Trouble on that side with
<HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sueden</HI> has little occasion of dif|ference,
or reason, to apprehend
any Quarrel, neither does it seem
the Interest of <HI>Sueden</HI> to aim at any
further Enlargements in <HI>Germany,</HI>
but rather to use all good Offices
to preserve the Treaty of <HI>Munster,</HI>
as the Foundation of its Right
to <HI>Pomerania</HI> and <HI>Bremen;</HI> which
Provinces are of such Importance
to <HI>Sueden,</HI> as rendring it much more
considerable to all <HI>Europe</HI> than
it would otherwise be, that they
will never be parted with so long
as <HI>Sueden</HI> is able to defend them.</P>
<P>The Intercourse with <HI>Denmark,</HI>
has seldom been friendly, nor have
there ever wanted Grounds of
Quarrels, when the Conjunctures
were favourable; tho' at present
<PB N="163" REF="89">
<HI>Sueden</HI> seems to have little occasi|on
of Misintelligence with that
Crown, unless on the account of
the State of Affairs abroad, and
the several Interests they have to
mind therein; their Agreement in
Point of Trade seems to cement
them, but their Emulation in re|gard
of a Mediation, and in other
Points, is as likely to keep them
at a distance; nor is it at all pro|bable
they ever will, or can so far
surmount their mutual Distrusts,
as actually to take part on the
same side. But in regard of their own
Affairs, <HI>Sueden</HI> has gained so much
from <HI>Denmark</HI> already, and the
Interest of the Trading part of
<HI>Europe</HI> is so much concern'd to
hinder it from getting more, that
being also inferior to <HI>Denmark</HI> by
Sea it is not probable it will in
many Years have any design of
enlarging its Territories farther on
<PB N="164" REF="90">
that side, tho' it has undoubtedly
a longing Desire to <HI>Norway,</HI> which
would make it the sole Master of
all Naval Stores. And <HI>Denmark</HI>
is so much weaker at Land, that
<HI>Sueden</HI> has no reason to appre|hend
it, unless Domestick Con|fusions
do happen, which in all
times <HI>Denmark</HI> has been ready to
foment, and has frequently pro|fited
by them; and it is not very
improbable, but it may, in not
many Years have an opportunity
of doing so again; for which
reason especially it is the Interest
of <HI>Sueden</HI> to carry fair, and live at
peace with <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>In Point of Alliances the less
<HI>Sueden</HI> can depend upon its
Neighbours, the more careful it
has been to entertain Friendship
further from home, especially with
<HI>France;</HI> which first began about
150 Years ago between <HI>Francis</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="90">
the First, and <HI>Gustavus</HI> the First,
and subsisted till of late Years,
that the <HI>Emperor</HI>'s Party was
thought more agreeable to the Na|tion's
Interest, which it has ac|cordingly
espoused.</P>
<P>The Friendship of <HI>England</HI> or
<HI>Holland,</HI> or both, has ever been
accounted indispensibly necessary
to <HI>Sueden,</HI> in regard of its Weak|ness
by Sea; neither has <HI>Sueden</HI> hi|therto
engaged in any War, where
both those Nations were Parties:
and if such a Case should happen,
'tis not to be doubted but <HI>Sueden</HI>
would use all possible means to
obtain a Peace; for that the Coun|try
cannot subsist without a quick
Vent of its own Commodities, and
continual Supplies of such Neces|saries,
as it must receive from a|broad,
of which it is very un|usual
to make any Provision be|fore-hand,
or lay up greater
<PB N="166" REF="91">
Stores than what one Winter con|sumes.</P>

<P>THE Original of the <HI>Suedish</HI>
Nations which their Hi|storians
ascribe to <HI>Magog,</HI> Son of
<HI>Iaphet,</HI> whose Expedition thither
they placed in the Year 88, after
the Flood, is built upon such un|certain
Conjectures, as neither de|serves

any more than the Names

him, invented by the Writers to
fill up the Vacuities of those dark
Times, of which other Countries,
more likely to have been first
<PB N="167" REF="91">
planted, can give so little account;
therefore tho' the Country might
possibly have been early inhabited,
yet nothing of certainty can be
known of it, till the coming of
<HI>Othinus,</HI> or <HI>Woden,</HI> who was dri|ven
out of <HI>Asia</HI> by <HI>Pompey</HI> the
<HI>Great,</HI> about Sixty Years before
the Birth of <HI>Christ.</HI> From this
<HI>Woden,</HI> who (as their Histories re|port)
conquer'd <HI>Moscovy, Saxony,
Sueden, Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway;</HI>
all <HI>Northern</HI> Nations have been
ambitious to derive their Extracti|on;
with him the <HI>Heathenish</HI> Re|ligion,
that afterwards prevail'd in
the <HI>North,</HI> Witchcraft, and other
like Arts were brought in; as also
the Custom of raising great heaps
of Earth upon the Graves of Per|sons
of Note, and Engraving of
Funeral Inscriptions upon Rocks
and Stones, which yet remain in
all Parts of the Country.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="92">
To <HI>Woden,</HI> after his Death,
Divine Honours were paid, as the
God of War; and as the two first
Days of the Week were named
after the Sun and Moon, and <HI>Tues|day</HI>
after <HI>Tis</HI> or <HI>Disa,</HI> an ancient
Idol, so <HI>Wednesday</HI> had its Name
from him, as <HI>Thursday</HI> from <HI>Thor,</HI>
and <HI>Friday</HI> from <HI>Frigga,</HI> which
three last were long the chief Ob|jects
of the <HI>Northern</HI> Idolatry.
The Succession of the Kings after
<HI>Woden</HI> is full of confusion; the
Nation being sometimes parcell'd
into several little Kingdoms, some|times
into two, <HI>Sueden</HI> and <HI>Go|thia;</HI>
often subject to <HI>Den|mark</HI>
or <HI>Norway,</HI> and sometimes
Master of those Countries, as also
of others more distant, where the
<HI>Goths,</HI> that forsook their Native
Soil, happened to plant themselves;
but when, or on what particular
occasions, they made those Migra|tions,
<PB N="169" REF="92">
is not certainly known, nor
how long they had been abroad
when they first began to infest the
<HI>Roman</HI> Empire, about 300 Years
after <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who were cal|led
into <HI>England</HI> about the Year
450, were originally a Colony of
<HI>Goths</HI> is conjectured from the A|greement
of their Language, Laws
and Customs. But that the <HI>Suedes</HI>
and <HI>Goths,</HI> joyned with the <HI>Danes</HI>
and <HI>Norwegians</HI> in their Invasion
of <HI>England,</HI> about the Year 800,
we are assured from our own Hi|storians,
that expresly mention
them, with the Character of Bar|barous
and Pagan Nations, as they
then were; and the same may be
concluded from the many <HI>Saxon</HI>
Coyns, that are frequently found
in <HI>Sueden,</HI> and in greater variety,
than in <HI>England,</HI> which seem to
have been the <HI>Dane</HI> Gilt, or
<PB N="170" REF="93">
Tribute that the Nation then
paid.</P>
<P>The <HI>Normans</HI> also, who about
that time settled in <HI>France,</HI> were
in part Natives of this Country,
so that <HI>England,</HI> together with the
Miseries that accompanied those
Conquests, owes a great part of
its Extraction to these People.</P>
<P>But to pass on to Times of more
certainty, it was about the Year
830, that the Emperor <HI>Ludovicus
Pius</HI> sent <HI>Ansgarius,</HI> afterwards
Arch-bishop of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> to at|tempt
the Conversion of the <HI>Suedes</HI>
and <HI>Goths,</HI> who at first had little
or no Success; but in his second
Journey, some Years after, he
was better received; and baptized
the King <HI>Olaus,</HI> who was after|wards
martyred by his Heathen
Subjects, and offered in Sacrifice
to their Gods; nor did Christiani|ty
become the general Religion of
<PB N="171" REF="93">
<HI>Sueden</HI> till about a Hundred Years
after, when it was planted by the
<HI>English</HI> Bishops formerly mention|ed,
sent for thither by another <HI>O|laus;</HI>
in whose time the Kingdom
of <HI>Sueden,</HI> and that of <HI>Gothia</HI>
were united, but became after|wards
to be separated again, and
continued so near Two Hundred
Years; when they were again
joyn'd, on Condition that the
Two Royal Families should suc|ceed
each other by turns, as they
did for the space of One Hundred
Years, but not without great Dis|orders,
and much Blood shed.</P>
<P>This occasion of Quarrel, which
ended in the Extirpation of the

and shed so much innocent
Blood, especially of the Nobility,
which he design'd utterly to root
out, that his Reign became into|lerable,
and the whole Nation
conspired against him under the
Conduct of</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus</HI> the <HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1521.</NOTE> descended
from the ancient Kings of <HI>Sueden,</HI>
whose Father had being beheaded,
and his Mother had two Sisters
imprison'd by <HI>Christiern:</HI> He was
at first received Governour of the
Kingdom, and two Years after
had the Regal Dignity conferr'd
on him; and as the <HI>Danes</HI> and
<HI>Norwegians</HI> had also expell'd King
<HI>Christiern,</HI> who had married <HI>Charles</HI>
the <HI>5th</HI>'s Sister, and repaired to
the Imperial Court for Succour,
which he could not obtain to any
purpose, being upon his Landing
in <HI>Norway</HI> defeated, and taken
<PB N="180" REF="98">
Prisoner; in which State he con|tinued
to his Death: Therefore
<HI>Gustavus</HI> was freed from all further
trouble, on that account; and at
liberty to redress the Disorders of
the Kingdom, which were great:
His first Contest was with the
<HI>Clergy, who had been the Authors
of much Confusion in former Reigns;</HI>
to prevent which for the future,
he took all occasions to diminish
their Revenues, reuniting to the
Crown all the Lands that had
been given to the Church the last
Hundred Years; which together
with the <HI>Reformation</HI> of Religion
disquieted the first Ten Years of
his Reign, and occasioned frequent
Commotions: Which being over,
the remainder of his time pass'd
without any disturbance at home,
or Wars abroad; save only with
<HI>Lubeck,</HI> and sometimes with <HI>Mos|covy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="98">
Hitherto the Kingdom of <HI>Sue|den</HI>
had for several hundred Years
been <HI>Elective,</HI> but was at this
time made <HI>Hereditary</HI> to the <HI>Male</HI>
Issue of <HI>Gustavus,</HI> in a right Line
of Succession; with reservation,
that in default of such Issue the
<HI>Right</HI> of <HI>Election</HI> should return to
the Estates. <HI>Gustavus</HI> by his
three Wives had four Sons, and
several Daughters; his eldest Son,
<HI>Erick,</HI> was to succeed to the Crown;
<HI>Iohn</HI> was made Duke of <HI>Finland;
Magnus,</HI> Duke of <HI>Ostrogothia;</HI> and
<HI>Charles,</HI> Duke of <HI>Sudermanland;</HI>
whereby those Provinces were in a
manner dismembred from the
Crown: An Error in Policy that
<HI>Sueden</HI> has so oft smarted for,
that they have since made solemn
Resolutions never to be guilty of
it again; thus having in his Reign
of Thirty six Years brought the
<PB N="182" REF="99">
Kingdom into such a flourishing
Condition, as it had not seen in
many Ages, and entail'd a Crown
upon his Family, in which it still
continues: He left it to his
Son</P>
<P><HI>Erick,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1559.</NOTE> who was thereby hin|dred
from prosecuting his intend|ed
Voyage to <HI>England,</HI> with hopes
to marry Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> He
Reigned Nine Years, Five of
which he kept his Brother <HI>Iohn</HI>
close Prisoner, upon Suspicion of
his designing to supplant him, as
he finally did, but not before <HI>Erick</HI>
his making a Peasant's Daughter
his Queen, and by several cruel
and dishonourable Actions had
lost the Affections of all his
Subjects; so that he was with|out
much difficulty deposed, and
condemned to a perpetual Prison,
where he ended his Life. Upon
<PB N="183" REF="99">
his Deposition, the Crown came
to</P>
<P><HI>Iohn</HI> III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1568.</NOTE> notwithstanding the
States of the Kingdom had enga|ged
their <HI>future Allegiance</HI> to King
<HI>Erick</HI>'s Son, that he had by the
Queen before Marriage. The
War with <HI>Moscovy,</HI> which be|gan
in King <HI>Erick</HI>'s time, about
<HI>Liefland,</HI> was carried on by this
King with good Success, and se|veral
Places taken; to which not
only <HI>Muscovy,</HI> but <HI>Poland</HI> and
<HI>Denmark</HI> also pretended; for as
the <HI>Knights Templers</HI> had trans|ferr'd
their Right to <HI>Liefland</HI> up|on
<HI>Poland;</HI> so the <HI>Muscovites</HI> had
agreed to deliver it to <HI>Magnus,</HI>
Duke of <HI>Holstein,</HI> the King of
<HI>Denmark</HI>'s Brother; in considera|tion
of a small Acknowledgement
to the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> as the
Supream Lord: So that Four
<PB N="184" REF="100">
great Nations claimed this Coun|try
at once, which possibly might
facilitate the <HI>Suedish</HI> Conquests.</P>
<P>This Prince's Reign was disquiet|ed
by his Attempt to alter the <HI>E|stablish'd
Religion,</HI> in which he
made considerable progress; but
was sometimes in doubt, whether
he should endeavour an <HI>Vnion</HI>
with the <HI>Latin</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> Church;
to the former of which he at last
declared himself; but could not
prevail with his Subjects to follow
his Example. He kept his Bro|ther
<HI>Erick</HI> Ten Years in Prison,
and then thought it necessary for
Safety to have him poyson'd, ac|cording
to the Advice which it is
said the States of the Kingdom
had given.</P>
<P>His Brother <HI>Magnus</HI> did not
Minister any Cause of Suspicion,
being disturbed in his Brain, and
<PB N="185" REF="100">
uncapable of having any De|sign.</P>
<P>But his Brother <HI>Charles</HI> gave
him sufficient occasion of Jealousie,
and it was not without great diffi|culty,
that things were kept from
coming to an extremity between
them.</P>
<P>After a Reign of Thirty six
Years King <HI>Iohn</HI> died by the Fault
of an ignorant Apothecary, there
being then no Physicians in
<HI>Sueden;</HI> to him succeeded his
Son</P>
<P><HI>Sigismund,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1592.</NOTE> whose Mother was
<HI>Catharine,</HI> a Princess of the <HI>Ia|gellan</HI>
Family in <HI>Poland:</HI> To which
Crown, <HI>Sigismund</HI> had been Elect|ed
Five Years before his Father
died: His Brother <HI>Iohn</HI> was in
his Minority; so that his Uncle
<HI>Charles</HI> had the Government of
the Kingdom, till <HI>Sigismund</HI> came
<PB N="186" REF="101">
from <HI>Poland</HI> to be Crowned in
<HI>Sueden;</HI> which was not till about
a Year after his Fathers decease.
His Coronation was retarded some
Months, by the Difficulties that
arose about the Points of Religi|on,
and the Confirmation of Pri|viledges:
All which were at last
accommodated, and the King af|ter
a Years stay in <HI>Sueden,</HI> return|ed
to <HI>Poland,</HI> leaving the Kingdom
in great Confusion, which daily
encreas'd.</P>
<P>So that at his return some Years
after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1598.</NOTE> he was met by his Uncle
at the Head of an Army, which
defeated the Forces the King
brought with him. Whereupon
an Accomodation being patched
up, he returned to <HI>Poland,</HI> leaving
his Uncle to manage the Go|vernment.
Which Post he held,
till the States being weary of <HI>Sigis|mund,</HI>
<PB N="187" REF="101">
and having in vain brought
him to consent to his Son's Ad|vancement
to the Crown, which
his Brother <HI>Iohn</HI> also refused:
They conferr'd it upon his Uncle
<HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>9th,</HI> who thereby be|came
engaged in a War with <HI>Po|land,</HI>
as he was already with <HI>Mus|covy;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1604.</NOTE>
the Scene of both being
in <HI>Liefland,</HI> where the <HI>Suedes</HI>
lost Ground, till the Affairs of
<HI>Muscovy</HI> fell into such Confusion,
that they were forced to give <HI>Sue|den</HI>
a Peace, that they might have
its Assistance against the <HI>Poles</HI> and
<HI>Tartars;</HI> which was granted upon
Terms very advantageous for <HI>Sue|den,</HI>
and sent under the Conduct
of Count <HI>Iacob de la Gardie,</HI> who
did <HI>Muscovy</HI> great Service; but
the <HI>Muscovites</HI> failing to perform
the Conditions stipulated, he
broke with them, and took the
<PB N="188" REF="102">
City of <HI>Novogrod,</HI> and disposed
the Inhabitants, with others of the
Neighbouring Provinces, to desire
Prince <HI>Charles, (Phillip,</HI> the King's
younger Son) to be their <HI>Czar;</HI>
which was so long in treating
about, that the Opportunity was
lost.</P>
<P>The Year before this King's
Death a War broke out with
<HI>Denmark;</HI> in which State he left
the Kingdom to his Son</P>
<P><HI>Gustavus Adolphus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1611.</NOTE> who ha|ving
ended the War with <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
by the Mediation of <HI>Iames</HI>
the <HI>1st,</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> applied him|self
to that in <HI>Leifland</HI> and <HI>Mus|covy:</HI>
To the Borders of which he
sent his Brother, not with an In|tention
to procure his Establish|ment
in that Throne, which he ra|ther
aimed at for himself; But to in|duce
the fortified Places adjacent to
<PB N="189" REF="102">
<HI>Finland</HI> and <HI>Liefland,</HI> to accept of
<HI>Suedish</HI> Garisons in Prince <HI>Charles
Phillip</HI>'s Name, which succeeded
in a great measure, till another
was chosen <HI>Czar;</HI> with whom, af|ter
various Success on both sides,
a Peace was concluded by the Me|diation
of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI>
by which <HI>Sueden,</HI> besides part of
<HI>Liefland,</HI> got the Country of <HI>Inger|manland,</HI>
and the Province of <HI>Kex|holm,</HI>
with several fortified Places,
and wholly shut out the <HI>Muscovites</HI>
from the <HI>East</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>The <HI>Polish</HI> War, that had some
short Intervals of Truces, was of
a longer continuance, and no less
beneficial to <HI>Sueden;</HI> which, in
the Course of it, took <HI>Riga,</HI> and
all other Places the <HI>Poles</HI> had in
<HI>Liefland,</HI> except only one Fort,
and thence carried the War into
<HI>Prussia</HI> with the like Success, till
<PB N="190" REF="103">
at last by the Interposition of
<HI>England, France,</HI> &amp;c. a Truce was
concluded for six Years.</P>
<P>This gave <HI>Gustavus</HI> leisure to
engage in the <HI>German</HI> War, to
which he was both provoked by
the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and encouraged by
others. The Year following he
began that Expedition, and on
<HI>Iune</HI> 24. arriving in the Mouth
of the <HI>Odor,</HI> he Landed his little
Army that consisted of Sixteen
Troops of Horse, and Ninety two
Companies of Foot, making a|bout
Eight Thousand Men, which,
besides other Additions, was aug|mented
by Six Regiments of <HI>Eng|lish</HI>
and <HI>Scotch</HI> under Duke <HI>Hamil|ton,</HI>
but more by the King's incre|dible
Success.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="103">
Upon his first approach <HI>Stetin</HI>
and all <HI>Pomerania</HI> fell into his
Hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 7. 1631.</NOTE> The Year following ha|ving
joyned the <HI>Elector of Saxony,</HI>
he gave the <HI>Emperour</HI>'s Army under
General <HI>Tilly,</HI> a total Overthrow
near <HI>Liepsig:</HI> Whence he traver|sed
<HI>Franconia,</HI> the <HI>Palatinate, Ba|varia,</HI>
&amp;c. till the next Year at
the Battle of <HI>Lutzen</HI> (where his
Army was again victorious) he
was treacherously kill'd, (as 'tis
believed) by <HI>Francis Albert,</HI> Duke
of <HI>Saxon Lawemburgh;</HI> not only
to the great Joy of the <HI>Imperia|lists,</HI>
but of <HI>France</HI> and other his
Friends, who envied and feared
the farther Encrease of his Great|ness.
By his Death the Crown
fell to his Daughter,</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="104">
<HI>Christina,</HI> a Princess of Five
Years old, in whose Favour her
Father had gained the States of
the Kingdom to alter the <HI>Heredi|tary
Vnion,</HI> as 'tis stiled, which
restrained the Succession to the
<HI>Male</HI> Line. In her Minority the
Chancellor <HI>Axel Oxenstiern</HI> had
the Direction of the <HI>Suedish</HI> Af|fairs
in <HI>Germany;</HI> where the War
was prosecuted with variety of
Success, but much to the Advan|tage
of <HI>Sueden;</HI> which was possest
of above a Hundred fortified
Places, and had an Army exceed|ing
100000 Men, when Prince
<HI>Charles Gustave</HI> was Generalissimo.
