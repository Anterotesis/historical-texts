<HEAD><HI>In a Letter from</HI> Che&s;ter <HI>of</HI> Augu&s;t <HI>the</HI> 31&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> finding that they had not gain'd much Reputation by their Actions in the Field, or by being valiant and &s;ucce&s;sful in the taking of Towns, were re&s;olved at la&s;t to try what they could do in keeping of Towns committed to their Care and Courage: <HI>Carrick fergus</HI> was the place where they thought &s;it, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to retrieve their Credit and Reputation: But when our Frigats at Sea, and Land Forces at Land had appeared before it, and made &s;uch Breaches in the Walls, and De&s;truction in the Town, by their Guns and Bombs, they judged in &s;afe&s;t for them to Capitulate and Surrender; which they did on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> la&s;t. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of near Two thou&s;and Men, and though at the fir&s;t Summons &s;ent them by the Duke of <HI>Schom|berg,</HI> they were &s;o &s;tout as to refu&s;e to hearken to any Conditions of Surren|der, yet their Courage not continuing long, they accepted of the Terms of Marching out with Colours flying Arms, and Drums beating, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to go to <HI>Charlemont.</HI> But &s;uch was the ill nature of the Rabble, that they fell upon
<PB N="2" REF="2"> them in their March, and di&s;arm'd them. The Town has been &s;o mi&s;era|bly defaced by the continual playing of the Bombs for Five Days together, that it looks like a di&s;mal heap of ruine. Sir <HI>Henry Ingolsby</HI> is made Go|vernour of the Town and Ca&s;tle: A great deal of Arms, Ammunition, and Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, was found in the Town. This has cleared the <HI>North,</HI> for the mo&s;t part, of any con&s;iderable Party of the <HI>Iri&s;h:</HI> many come in dayly to the General. The Ships come la&s;t Night to <HI>High-lake,</HI> a&s;&s;ure us of the Arrival of the Four Regiments of Hor&s;e into the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Carrick-fer|gus;</HI> who were turning in into the <HI>Lake</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> as the Ships that are arrived here were turning out from thence.</P>
<P>Neither is it in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> only, where Succe&s;s does &s;o con&s;tantly attend their Maje&s;ties Affairs, but even the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> afford us variety of Examples of Zeal for his Maje&s;ties Service: For the Blo&s;&s;om of <HI>London</HI> coming from <HI>Antego,</HI> in <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, and arrived here two days ago, brings the News, that Sr. <HI>Nathaniel John&s;ton</HI> not finding it &s;afe for him to continue longer upon tho&s;e I&s;lands, whereof he had the Government committed to him in the late Reign, is gone to <HI>Carolina,</HI> and that the Inhabitants of <HI>Mevis</HI> and other I&s;lands had con&s;tituted Major General <HI>Codrington</HI> Governour in his room; That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Planters and Inhabitants of <HI>Mont&s;erat</HI> had declared for the late King, and appeared in a Body of Seven or Eight hundred Men for that Intere&s;t, but that Colonel <HI>Blake&s;ton,</HI> the Governour of the &s;aid I&s;land had rai&s;ed what <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men he could, to the number of Two hun|dred, with which he was re&s;olved to attack them: But the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw him appear with that unequal number of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to march to|wards them, but they all offered to lay down their Arms, and upon Arti|cles promi&s;ed to di&s;per&s;e; at which in&s;tant of time a Reinforcement of an Hundred and fifty Men arrived from <HI>Antego</HI> and &s;eized the chief of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> brought them up Pri&s;oners to <HI>Antego,</HI> and &s;olemnly Proclaim'd King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> with all po&s;&s;ible Demon&s;trations of Joy and Gladne&s;s. The new Governour <HI>Codrington</HI> hath &s;ent an Hundred Men from <HI>Mevis</HI> to St. <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI>'s to &s;trengthen the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t in that I&s;land.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Hewets,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Villers</HI> Regiments of Hor&s;e are to embark with the fir&s;t fair Wind for <HI>Ireland</HI> to joyn the Duke of <HI>Schomberg.</HI></P>
