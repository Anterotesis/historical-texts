<P>From Algier they write, that the Pirate be|gin to erect a Common wealth among them|&s;elues, and haue written to the Hollanders, that if they will vnite with their forces toge|ther, they will make an notable attempt vp|on the dominions of the King of Spaine, and begin a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there.</P>
<P>It is reported here that at Naples there hath been an attempt made vpon the Viceroy by the Nobility and inhabitants, being perplex|ed with a dearth: but they cry out vpon no|thing &s;o much as liberty, and lye in waite to put &s;ome thing in execution.</P>
<P>The&s;e that come from Rome, relate that the Pope hath giuen a free indulgence and pardon of &s;innes to all them that will &s;erue the Emperour in his wars, wherupon many &s;oul|diers and great &s;tore of money are &s;ent vnto him.</P>

<P>They write from Florence and Luca, that there is great complaint again&s;t the Engli&s;h, &s;eeing they deale not for &s;o many &s;ilkes as they were v&s;ed to doe; and therefore they will endeauour to make cloth and cottens of their owne, and not trade with <HI>England,</HI> as in times pa&s;t.</P>

<P>From <HI>Spaine,</HI> there is newes of the feare of the Mores, who haue lately made an attempt in <HI>Granado,</HI> and word is brought by a <HI>Brazill</HI> man into <HI>Portingall,</HI> that the wilde men about the River of <HI>Amazones,</HI> haue rebelled again&s;t the <HI>Portingals,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who governe the Country and rule there.

Or other wi&s;e it may be, their great numbers keepe all in awe, and that the Emperour is loath to be troubled with warres abroad, and di&s;&s;entions at home.</P>
<P>From <HI>Odenburgh,</HI> is here newes that the Emperour propo&s;ed to the Lords and States, the Coronation of his Sonne, but that they ab&s;olutely denyed it, as ha|ving made choice of another.</P>

<P>It was al&s;o Reported, that the Co|&s;ackes having no Warres in Poland, threatned to come downe into Hunga|ria, which the Ie&s;uits vrged, and the Em|perour intertayned, but it is &s;ayd, and thought, the Tartarians and Ru&s;&s;ians will keepe them backe with their Incur&s;ions and Enterpri&s;es, which they intend to make &s;hortly.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e parts are &s;till made great mu|&s;terings, to &s;upply the Emperours warres. This Cittie, <HI>Prague</HI> it &s;elfe, hath guard and watch like a Towne of warre, and they beate vnto the <HI>Parado,</HI> as if the enemie lay before it. In plaine termes, they are iea|lous one of another, and the Heires and Friends of tho&s;e whom the Emperour put to execution, long to be revenged. As for the Iewes, though they generally reioyce at tho&s;e di&s;&s;entions among <HI>Chri|&s;tians,</HI> and &s;laughtering one another, yet doe they particularly rather fauour the Prote&s;tants then the Catholiques.</P>

But among other things, the Bi&s;hops are mo&s;t fierce again&s;t the Prote&s;tants, and will not &s;uffer them to goe vnto their Churches.</P>
<P>From <HI>Poland</HI> we haue Newes, that the inhabitants being become loath of the Ie|&s;uits, the Nobilitie hath reque&s;ted the King, either to bani&s;h or di&s;mi&s;&s;e them, about which is great di&s;content occa&s;io|ned.</P>

<P>In <HI>Hungaria</HI> the matters &s;tand yet doubt|full: the <HI>Hungarians</HI> haue flatly denyed the Coronation of the Emperors &s;onne: the Clergie de&s;ires to haue all the Spiri|tuall goods backe againe, with the arrera|ges,
