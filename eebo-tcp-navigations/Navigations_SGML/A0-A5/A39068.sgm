<P>THe fir&s;t thing to be con&s;idered in Breeding is the commodi|ou&s;ne&s;s of the Ground, wherein the Hor&s;es, Mares and Colts are to run, which mu&s;t in no wi&s;e be too rank of Gra&s;s, nor over &s;paring, but a firm, &s;weet Soil, &s;ituate in a whol&s;ome Air, &s;omewhat a&s;cending; inclo&s;ed with Quick&s;ets and &s;preading Trees, the better to &s;helter your Bea&s;ts from the wind or heat of the Sun: Nor let your Mares, Colts or Hor&s;es continue long in one Pa&s;ture, but put them into fre&s;h Pa&s;ture, and let the vici&s;|&s;itude be &s;o often as occa&s;ion requires, or as you find them unea&s;ie, which will ap|pear ether by their carele&s;ne&s;s in feeding, attempting to leap the Hedges, Ditches, or making continually towards the Gate,
<PB N="4" REF="16"> and looking through it or over it: The Summer Pa&s;tures mu&s;t be &s;hady as afore|&s;aid, and tho&s;e you intend to winter them in, accommodated with a Hovel, Hay-rick, Barn, Stable, or &s;ome convenient hou&s;e to &s;helter them from the &s;tormy bla&s;ts, e&s;|pecially the Colts, who are by nature tender the fir&s;t year.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Directions and Rules about the choice of Hor&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THe next thing to be con&s;idered, is the choice of Stallions and Mares; Fir&s;t, let your Stallion have hoofs hard and &s;ound, round and hollow, to keep the feet from the Ground, his Legs even and &s;traight, his knees round, flexible and &s;mall, his Thighs large and well brawned, his Brea&s;t great and broad, his neck &s;oft and broad bending Arch-wi&s;e, his Main thick, and for the mo&s;t part falling on the right &s;ide, his Head &s;mall and lean, for a great head betokens a dull and heavy Jade, his Mouth ever moi&s;t, his Eyes great and bloody, or rather fiery, &s;tanding as it were, out of his head, which is a &s;ign of quickne&s;s and liveline&s;s, his Ears &s;hort
<PB REF="16"> and &s;tanding upright, his No&s;trils wide, his Shoulders large and &s;traight, the &s;ides turn|ing inwards, the ridge bone over the &s;houl|ders being &s;omewhat high, his Sides deep and well knit behind, his Loyns broad, his Belly gaunt, his Buttocks full of fle&s;h, his Tail long, bri&s;ly and curled: the&s;e be|ing the tokens of a good Stallion, and in|deed of a good Hor&s;e for all &s;ervices; the con|trary properties denoting badne&s;s: And now I &s;hall proceed to the de&s;cription of a good Mare for breeding; fir&s;t, ob&s;erve &s;he be not &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es, nor above three or four years old, let her have a fair forehead, lively eyes, &s;tanding ears, a large womb, a bright colour, and well metled, gentle and ea&s;ie to be handled, for wild Mares are too apt to de&s;troy their Colts in their bellies, and when foaled will not ea&s;ily brook the weaning of them.</P>

<HEAD>How to oblige a Mare that is unwilling to take the Hor&s;e, to be covered, when; and in what manner &s;he ought to be covered, and how afterwards to be u&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P>IF your Mare be backward to take the Hor&s;e, which will appear by her bi|ting and kicking at him, then turn to her a &s;tone Hor&s;e of &s;mall &s;tature, who by his nimble running about her and playing with her, will &s;oon wooe, or oblige her to gentlene&s;s, &s;o that &s;he will &s;uffer her &s;elf to be covered, which willingne&s;s perceived, take away the &s;aid Hor&s;e, and the next mor|ning about Sunri&s;ing, put to her your Stalli|on having been well provendered, but &s;uf|fered to drink little, put him to her in a clo&s;e fenced ground, where &s;he will in a &s;hort time permit him to cover her, the which when he has twice or thrice done, let her graze, but keep her from water; taking the Hor&s;e from her, whom you mu&s;t rub down and well provender till E|vening, at what time turn him loo&s;e to your Mare again, and let him cover her as often
<PB N="7" REF="17"> as he plea&s;eth, unle&s;s you perceive him too robu&s;t or furious, that thereby he may &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">+tain injury.</P>
<P>The Mare thus covered, unle&s;s &s;he be greatly de&s;irous of his company a third time, you need not put him to her again, but lead the Mare into the water above the belly, and there let her drink, though no great quan|tity, after which turn her to the Stud of Mares, not permitting any Hor&s;e to come at her for the &s;pace of one month.</P>

<HEAD>To make a Mare be Covered, when you per|ceive &s;he has not Conceived of the former. The time be&s;t for Covering; what diet is be&s;t for the Stallion, to prepare him for Covering; how to u&s;e your Mare when &s;he is with Foal.</HEAD>
<P>IF you conceit your Mare or Mares have not conceived by their being co|vered, and yet decline taking Hor&s;e, put among them a Mare that is de&s;irous to be covered, and then turn in your Stallion, who by covering the Mare la&s;t put in, will provoke the others to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be covered. The mo&s;t convenient time to &s;uffer your Mares to be covered, is in <HI>May,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>June,</HI> for then
<PB N="8" REF="18"> the Colts by not coming too early in the Spring, will find warm weather, and green Pa&s;ture to nouri&s;h and pre&s;erve them. When you intend your Stallion &s;hall cover your Mare; the be&s;t way is to let him feed on Gra&s;s, for by that means his Limbs will be more pliable, and his Wind the longer; when as hard meat will not only make him &s;omewhat Re&s;tif, but &s;ub|ject him if he much over-&s;train him&s;elf, to break his wind When your Mare is fourteen or fifteen days gone with Foal, take her up from the other Mares; and with one gentle Mare or Gelding put her into rank and well inclo&s;ed Pa&s;ture, which will render her lu&s;ty, de&s;irous again to be covered, the more ea&s;ily to bring forth her Colt, and &s;tore her with milk for its nou|ri&s;hment.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What time your Stallion will conveniently &s;erve for Covering. What years in the Hor&s;e and Mare produce the be&s;t Colts, and when it is mo&s;t con|venient to wean Colts.</HEAD>
<P>A Good Stallion proportioned according to the afore&s;aid de&s;cription, if mo|derately u&s;ed, will &s;erve well &s;ix or &s;even years, to cover yearly &s;ix or &s;even Mares; and may in the intervall be put to &s;uch la|bour
<PB N="9" REF="18"> as you think nece&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s extra|ordinary travel in a long journey, where|by he may be greatly wa&s;ted and impair|ed. From three years old till ten, good Mares will conceive Colts; and a good Stal|lion, from four or five, till ten or twelve, get them. The be&s;t time to wean Colts is <HI>Shrovetide,</HI> or <HI>Candlema&s;s;</HI> and for the three fir&s;t years, have great care of them, but e&s;pecially the fir&s;t year, when they take no great delight in them&s;elves, for moaning after their Dams; and if you neglect the years afore&s;aid, to well Winter or Summer them, they will &s;carcely prove good Hor&s;es: the be&s;t way to order them, is to keep them out of the Neighing of their Dams, pinned up fourteen days after their weaning: after which days let them out on Sun&s;hiny days to play in little Pingles, or warm inclo&s;ed Pa|&s;tures, putting them up again &s;o &s;oon as you perceive them dull and heavy; and &s;o con|tinue them with good feeding till <HI>May;</HI> then the weather being warm, let them run in good Pa&s;ture, neither too rank nor too low; but &s;uch as Milch Kine are u&s;ually Pa&s;tured in, but be &s;ure it be into &s;oil that produceth &s;weet Gra&s;s, and in this manner continue them, till they have forgotten their Dams.</P>

<HEAD>Provender mo&s;t convenient for Colts after two years old, till they become fit for &s;ervice. The rea&s;ons why Engli&s;h breed ought not to be taken up &s;o young, though more convenient for their Ma&s;ters. How to handle and break wild and head&s;trong Hor&s;es, and to u&s;e them after they are made Gentle. The be&s;t feed|ing in the winter for Mares and Colts of two years old, and what age is be&s;t to handle them.</HEAD>
<P>BE &s;ure to ob&s;erve that your weanlings of the age afore&s;aid be not put to winter in cold wet Moori&s;h ground, nor in Summer to feed in over rank Pa&s;ture; for the one &s;ubjects them to all watery di&s;ea&s;es, and the other to the Glanders, Colds, and the like. Therefore let your Colts range in dry, &s;hort and warm pa&s;tures, that they may find enough to &s;uffice them, and too much. And le&s;t their growth be ob&s;tru|cted by covering any Mare, keep them from &s;o doing, till they are five years old at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Many are of opinion that Engli&s;h Hor&s;es are taken up &s;o young, becau&s;e, that if they &s;hould come to their full &s;trength ere they are broken, they would hardly be tamed,
<PB N="11" REF="19"> though this does altogether prove a vul|gar error: for by often u&s;ing young Hor&s;es to &s;eed them by hand, will make them tame, at any year, and to lay light weights upon them, which will in no wi&s;e hinder their growth, will prepare them to indure backing: Therefore it is my opinion that Engli&s;h Hor&s;es may be broken and brought to hand, at any time, as well as tho&s;e of other Nations: And that the taking them up before they come to their &s;trength and growth, is for that their Ma&s;ters are covetous of their &s;ervice, and will not permit them to be idle and chargeable any longer than needs mu&s;t; and this is the rea&s;on why Engli&s;h Hor|&s;es fall &s;hort many times in goodne&s;s, or at lea&s;t in e&s;teem, to tho&s;e of other Nations. For certain it is, that <HI>England</HI> is as capable of as good a breed as any Nation what&s;oever; and that by watching and keeping a Hor&s;e hungry, he at any age may be made tame or broken in a months time.</P>
<P>If a Hor&s;e be head&s;trong, &s;uffer him to have no provender, but what he takes out of your hands, in a &s;table or clo&s;e yard, and &s;o within a while he will come acquainted with you, and &s;uffer you to take up his feet, and by degrees to back and handle him at plea&s;ure.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="20">
<P>Ob&s;erve that when you have rid your Hor&s;e, keep him upon his Bridle, or gently moving till he be cold, and in no wi&s;e ride him hard upon a full &s;tomach, and it will pre&s;erve him from Sickne&s;s, Lamene&s;s and the like, unle&s;s &s;ome extraordinary thing befall him.</P>
<P>In winter time keep your Mares and weanling in a warm pa&s;ture, where a Rack being placed, you mu&s;t put thereinto, at di|vers times, &s;weet Provender; and if it prove wet, mi&s;ty, raw weather, they mu&s;t be &s;heltred in a Stable, Barn or Hovel, but if clear Fro&s;ty weather, not too extream, they may be left abroad. Let your pa&s;ture be near your hou&s;e, and about <HI>Shrovetide</HI> &s;hift it, and let them continue in fre&s;h pa|&s;ture till <HI>May,</HI> at which time the Gra&s;s will be &s;ufficiently &s;prung in mo&s;t places, and that time is the only time in all the year to produce hunger bane, and render the young Mares &s;o lean that they will not be capa|ble of bringing forth their Colts.</P>
<P>Take not up your Colts till they be four or five years old; for if &s;ooner, they will greatly &s;uffer, by untimely riding, and be|come &s;tiff, di&s;ea&s;ed, and un&s;erviceable be|fore they be twelve years old, when other|wi&s;e they will continue &s;erviceable twen|ty four or twenty five years: and the rea|&s;on
<PB N="13" REF="20"> why the Spani&s;h Hor&s;es are &s;o &s;oon pa&s;t their be&s;t, is for that they at two or three years old at the mo&s;t, take them up for want of ground to feed them in.</P>

<P>AT &s;ix months old the &s;hape may be di&s;cerned that he will be of at &s;ix years old, if he be not wronged or &s;poiled in keeping and bringing up; the defects are al&s;o to be &s;een at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>The &s;hin-bone being long and large from the Pa&s;tern to the knee, denotes the Colt to prove a tall Hor&s;e. And what &s;pace is found in a Colt new foaled, be|tween the Withers and knee, double that &s;pace will appear when he is full grown. Ob|&s;erve the activene&s;s, lively &s;pirits, and &s;tri|ving for ma&s;tery over their fellows among&s;t Colts, for &s;uch denote they will prove well mettalled, and &s;erviceable Hor&s;es; when dulne&s;s fore&s;hews the contrary.</P>
<P>If a Mare be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in her foaling, the ready way to make her bring forth, is to &s;top both her No&s;trils with your hand,
<PB N="14" REF="21"> that &s;o &s;he may be the better obliged to &s;train her &s;elf, or if that fail, take Madder to the quantity of a Pigeons Egg, boil it in a pint of ALE, and give it her warm.</P>
<P>If her Secundine, after foaling, come not away, take a handfull or two of young fennel, boil it in running-water, or &s;pring-water if you can get it, half a pint of which mix with as much Malm&s;ie, and a fourth quantity of Olive Oyle, and put it blood warm into the No&s;trils of your Mare, and hold them clo&s;e, or in defect of this, give her green Wheat or Rye to eat, but the former medicine is be&s;t, and will an&s;wer the end for which it was given. Ob&s;erve that your Mare in no wi&s;e eat her Clean|&s;ing, for it is not only unwhol&s;ome, but a great ob&s;tructer of her producing milk.</P>
<P>When a Colt is weaned, put him out of the hearing of his Dam as afore&s;aid, and the &s;ooner to make him forget her, give him Savin and Butter, which will effect it. Put him not to hard pa&s;ture, till the &s;econd or third year after his weaning.</P>
<P>Separate your Mare and Stone Colts at a year at furthe&s;t, for the Stone Colts being high fed and of much mettal, will attempt to cover the Mare Colts at the end of a year, which if permitted, proves the &s;poiling of them both. Nor is it a|mi&s;s
<PB N="15" REF="21"> but altogether convenient, to &s;eparate each years breed by putting them into di|vers pa&s;tures.</P>
<P>To geld Stone-Colts, the conveniente&s;t time is (and with the lea&s;t danger) at nine days old, if the Stones come down; if not let &s;ome days more pa&s;s ere you attempt it: In this ca&s;e, the time of the Moon and the &s;igns are to be ob&s;erved: The be&s;t time is when the Moon is in the Wain, and the &s;ign in <HI>Virgo,</HI> or <HI>Aries.</HI> And the be&s;t time in the year is the Spring and Fall: but al|though the&s;e are the &s;afe&s;t and conveniente&s;t times, yet this work may be done by a skillful hand at any time, as well on full grown Hor&s;es as young Colts. And thus much I have thought fit to lay down for the in&s;truction of the Breeder, which is the chiefe&s;t Office relating to a Hor&s;e; for if he be &s;poiled in the breeding, all la|bour, co&s;t and care be&s;towed upon him will prove fruitle&s;s, for he will never be a com|pleat Hor&s;e.</P>

<P>YOur Hor&s;e taken up, and with feeding by hand and handling made &s;omewhat familiar, hang the Saddle and Bridle al|ways near him, and often offer to put them on, till at la&s;t he will &s;uffer you to do it; then girt him about, though not too hard, but rather put &s;mall wi&s;ps of Hay between his body and the girths for his ea&s;e, and let your Bridle be as ea&s;ie as may be, though &s;trong and well put on to pre|vent his head&s;trongne&s;s if he attempt it. Then in a fair day carry him abroad into a plain field or other convenient place, and make him trot round you, &s;ometimes che|ri&s;hing him with your voice, and at other times &s;triking him with your &s;witch as you &s;ee occa&s;ion. Hang with your weight upon the Saddle, &s;hake the Stirrups, &s;trike them a|gain&s;t his &s;ides, and &s;train the Crupper, with all &s;uch matters as will happen in ri|ding, till he is familiar and &s;eems well to brook them.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="23">
<P>Your Hor&s;e by this means being plya|ble to the Saddle, take off the &s;light, loo&s;e and ea&s;ie Bridle. Gird the Saddle hard; then wa&s;hing his mouth with ALE, you &s;hall put into it a full mouth'd Trench, formerly u&s;ed, and drawing the Reins o|ver his head, lay them upon the Saddle, drawing them now and then, that he may have a feeling of the Trench, which will induce him to Champ, and play with the &s;ame, and thereby make him more famili|ar with it; after which having your Martin|gal in a readine&s;s, fa&s;ten it from the Chaul|band to the Girths, but with &s;ome &s;lackne&s;s, unle&s;s your Hor&s;e is apt to to&s;s up his head upon &s;tarting wantonne&s;s, or a col<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> he has got.</P>

Then hav|ing one to hold his head, advance by de|grees, &s;haking and moving your toes and body with equal motion, &s;o that your Hor&s;e may perceive you, and &s;o do divers times, cheri&s;hing and heartning him, till at length you dare tru&s;t him without any one to lead him: but venture not too quickly to ride him far, but make him more and more fa|miliar by giving him bread, gra&s;s, and other provender out of your hands; and by of|ten mounting and di&s;mounting, and &s;o con|tinue him without much intermi&s;&s;ion till he will advance, &s;tand, or turn at your di&s;|cretion.

<P>YOur Hor&s;e throughly tamed and learned to advance, &s;top and turn without any &s;eeming unwillingne&s;s; then riding him to &s;ome &s;andy or gravelly place, where the print of his foot&s;teps may plainly be &s;een, incircle the ground by trotting for the &s;pace of 50 paces in compa&s;s, which done three or four times, re&s;t on the right hand and cheri&s;h your Hor&s;e; then by moving him upon the Ring of the Circle, &s;top him upon the left hand, and let him re&s;t, &s;till incou|raging him, and by often changing your hand and mending your pace, you will &s;oon make him perfect, but upon every full &s;top make him retire a pace or two in the &s;ame manner, if you can, as when he trots forward.</P>
<P>Thus doing, your Hor&s;e will be ready upon all turns, and with little labour brought to under&s;tand your meaning in mo&s;t things, and e&s;pecially to gallop the Ring by degrees till he is capable of per|forming it at full &s;peed: Ob&s;erve in turn|ing about the Ring upon the gallop, whe|ther your Hor&s;e when he leads to the

<P>The fir&s;t &s;trait turn is to be mannaged thus, to the Ring in the middle of your Cavezan fa&s;ten a rein, about three yards or &s;omewhat more in length, and to the other two Rings two reins, &s;omewhat &s;hor|ter.

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Then divers are of opinion that the only way to bring a Hor&s;e to a perfect Amble, is to trace him to and fro, in a new ploughed field, where the Mould is dry and &s;oft; wherein they &s;ay he cannot with ea&s;e do any thing le&s;s than Amble: yet let me tell them, his Amble in &s;uch a ca&s;e, will be rather a &s;huffling, than a true Amble; be&s;ides, it toils him &s;o much that when he comes up|on plain ground, remembring the &s;lavery he was put to, he will rather fall into any
<PB N="30" REF="29"> other pace, and forever after be put out of love with Ambling.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> There are &s;ome who hold it the be&s;t way to oblige a Hor&s;e to fall from a gallop into an Amble, upon a &s;uddain &s;top, made by checking with your bridle, and bearing forward, clapping the Calves of their Legs clo&s;e to his &s;ides: but this rule is altogether uncertain; be&s;ides, by &s;uch &s;tops, they not only &s;poil their Hor&s;es mouths, and &s;o lo&s;e the command of their rein upon divers occa&s;ions, but indanger their Hor&s;es; indammaging them by over &s;training, &s;praining their &s;inews, break|ing their Hoofs, or the like.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Some, again, are for &s;etting on &s;hoos of an extraordinary weight, which makes a Hor&s;e interfere, and &s;trike &s;hort; often indangering him with lamene&s;s, and for fear of &s;triking, &s;o &s;low is his pace, that he can never by that means be brought to a graceful Amble. Others load their Hor|&s;es Fetlock-pa&s;terns, by wrapping Lead about them, which is more hurtful and dangerous than the former, often creating &s;trains, not curable, and by cru&s;hing or brui&s;ing the Crownet, cau&s;e Crown &s;cabs, Ring-bones, Quitter-bones, and the like, to the utter di&s;abling of the Hor&s;e. Others are of opinion that loading a Hor&s;e with pon|derous
<PB N="31" REF="29"> weights cro&s;s the Fillets, will ob|lige him to Amble. But let me tell them, al&s;o and experience teach them, that if they of|ten u&s;e that cour&s;e, it will undoubted|ly di&s;able any Hor&s;e, by rendering him &s;way-backed, and weak in the hinder parts.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Many give their opinion that there is no way like teaching a Hor&s;e to Amble by hand after this manner: bring him, &s;ay they, to the &s;ide of a &s;traight wall, Pail, or Rail, and having moved him a lit|tle, a walking pace till he begins to be warm; then with your bridle-hand, you being on foot chock him, and at the &s;ame time with your rod fitly &s;trike him on the hinder Houghs, and under his belly when he treads fal&s;e, cau&s;ing him to pace by degrees: But this Rule is uncertain, for it rather hares and frights the Hor&s;e, than any ways makes him under&s;tand what he is to do, obliging him to flounce, fly back, &s;praul, and rear him&s;elf on end, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which often u&s;ed he will retain, and ever after, upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion, &s;tart and fly out, or very hardly be induced to leave them, or &s;hould he by this means be brought to any perfection in Ambling; yet when you are mounted on his back he will be far to &s;eek, and not under&s;tand your
<PB N="32" REF="30"> motions, &s;o that it will prove but time &s;pent in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Many there are that hold a Hor&s;e may be brought to Amble, by having &s;hoos clapped on his hinder feet, with long plates before the toes, by which means at every &s;tep the hinder foot may reach the fore foot; but this is not only incommodious, but dangerous: for in the fir&s;t place the Hor&s;e mu&s;t go &s;huffling, and can be put into no true Amble; in the next place, if he &s;trike hard, he will cut, brui&s;e or &s;train the &s;inews on the back of the forefoot, &s;till beating the forelegs forward; which frequently cau&s;es halting and lamene&s;s not curable, there being no part about a Hor&s;e more tender.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Fine Li&s;ts, &s;ome hold be&s;t to Amble, which in this manner they propo&s;e; take &s;ay they, a fine Li&s;t, twi&s;t it in the nature of a Cord, and drawing it &s;trait about your Hor&s;es Cambrel, where Far|riers are wont to garter them for a &s;tiff &s;train, turn him to Gra&s;s, which cram|ping of his &s;inews will for his ea&s;e make him know no other pace but the Amble; and perfect him in it, in a fortnight or three-weeks. This is altogether uncertain, for the Hor&s;e finding him&s;elf cramped, will on|ly draw his legs after him, and &s;huffle un|le&s;s
<PB N="33" REF="30"> he be forced, and if the li&s;ts are drawn too &s;trait, when they are taken off, the &s;inews will be &s;o numbed that he will be only capable of crambling and cringing; and moreover it will greatly &s;ubject him to the &s;tring-halt, and often twitching up his legs.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> There &s;till remain &s;ome that &s;ay there is no way like u&s;ing your Hor&s;e to the Tramel, to oblige him to Amble, which indeed is the be&s;t method; yet &s;ince there are many errors and over-&s;ights in it, I &s;hall not think it ami&s;s to lay them down in or|der, and then proceed to give &s;uch rules as I conceive, and experience has proved, the be&s;t and readie&s;t way, to bring your Hor&s;e to an ea&s;ie, comely and graceful Am|ble.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t error is their not ob&s;erving the fit and ju&s;t length of the Tramel; for if it be too long and not capable of giving a &s;troke or too &s;hort, and by that means gives a fal&s;e &s;troke.</P>
<P>The former makes the Hor&s;e move &s;huffling and after a confu&s;ed manner, alto|gether improper and indecent; &amp; the latter by the &s;uddain twitches it obliges the Hor&s;e to make, &s;ubjects him to the &s;tring-halt, and other indecent motions of his feet.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="31">
<P>The Second error is in tho&s;e who without a due proportion of their Tramel, will place it out of order, <HI>viz.</HI> fa&s;ten it above the knee of the foreleg, and about the fet|lock of the hinderleg; when if it be too long, the foreleg cannot command the hinder to follow; and if it be too &s;hort and &s;trait, &s;o that the &s;inews and Ligaments are pre&s;|&s;ed and girded, and that the foreleg and hinder mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have equal moti|on, then will the main &s;inews be greatly in|jured in the hinder leg, as al&s;o the veins and Ligaments of the fore thighs, to the utter di&s;abling of your Hor&s;e for a time, if not for ever: nor can he then move, but in a cram|bling, &s;huffling and halting po&s;ture, altogether undecent and unprofitable; be&s;ides, it will by long chafing bring down the humours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Third Error, relating to the u&s;e of the Tramel, is when they that u&s;e it, make it of &s;uch cour&s;e hard &s;tuff that ei|ther by girding it too &s;trait, or leaving it too loo&s;e, it will either &s;o gird or gall, that both skin and hair will be taken off, and &s;o the Tramel rendred in&s;ufferable, and not an&s;wer the expectation of him that put it on.</P>
<P>The Fourth and la&s;t Error I &s;hall expo&s;e to view, is the opinions of many, that the Tramel is altogether unnece&s;&s;ary, alledging
<PB N="35" REF="31"> Ploughed land mo&s;t feezable, which is more an error in tho&s;e that a&s;&s;ert it, than the Tra|mel is u&s;ele&s;s or erroneous; for the Tramel in my opinion rightly applyed, is the only means to bring your Hor&s;e to a true Amble, the u&s;e of it being made as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>The mo&s;t approved and Experienced way to make a Hor&s;e Amble true and compleat.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you de&s;ign to teach your Hor&s;e the true Amble, fir&s;t by leading him a racking pace in your hand, ob&s;erve to what motion he is mo&s;t inclinable: whe|ther Trot, Running, Ba&s;tard-Amble or other, then mount him, and racking him delibe|rately, force him to advance by the help of his Mouth-Weeks, with his Snaffle, which mu&s;t be full, &s;mooth and large. Pre&s;s him gently on both &s;ides with the Calves of your legs, and now and then a gentle touch with the Spur, if by that means you can oblige him to &s;trike into an Amble; but above all be &s;ure you do not by too much chafing, or too &s;trong a hand di&s;or|der, or force him to di&s;tort either his Mouth, Neck or Head; and if he do fall into an Amble, as it were of his own accord, though not perfect, yet; it is greatly promi&s;ing that he will &s;oon be induced to a plea&s;ant
<PB N="36" REF="32"> Amble by the help of Art, and cau&s;e him with more patience and le&s;s danger to in|dure the Tramel, by rea&s;on the motion without &s;tumbling, flying out, or the like, becomes natural. And now the next thing to be con&s;idered is the form of the true Tramel and its u&s;e, divers there are that make them of Leather, &s;ome of Canvas, and others of Li&s;ts: but all of them are uncertain and in|commodious, by rea&s;on the fir&s;t will de|ceive the Hor&s;e and the Rider by &s;tretch|ing; the &s;econd di&s;able the Hor&s;e by gal|ling him, and the third doth &s;tretch and hang loo&s;e, by rea&s;on of its &s;oftne&s;s: there|fore the be&s;t way, though many ways there are in u&s;e, be&s;ides what I have mentioned, is to make your Tramel of &s;trong pack|thred, twi&s;ted into a cord, about the thick|ne&s;s of a Jack-line, hard and well dried, of which form your Tramel thus: let your &s;ide cords be &s;o firm that they will not give the lea&s;t way; let the ho&s;e, or part fa&s;ten|ed about his legs be clo&s;e, &s;oft and immove|able; the backbands light and &s;omewhat broad, the better to avoid hurting your Hor&s;es fillets, the length of the &s;ide Ropes mu&s;t be ju&s;t 36. inches; or if the Hor&s;e be of a long reach, an inch may be added but no more, and &s;o equal in length they mu&s;t be, that the difference of a &s;traws breadth
<PB N="37" REF="32"> mu&s;t not be perceived; the ho&s;e mu&s;t be placed on the &s;mall of the foreleg and upon the hinderleg, ju&s;t above the fetlock, made of Girth-web, lined with Flannel, Cotton or &s;ome &s;uch &s;oft matter, fa&s;tened with Neats-leather Tabs, made &s;upple by tallowing, of an even length, in which di|vers holes mu&s;t be punched at an even di|&s;tance, to pa&s;s through the noo&s;es which are to be on the &s;ide ropes, &s;o that by buckling them with &s;trong buckles; the &s;aid ropes may be drawn up or let out at plea&s;ure, the Tabs not to exceed 10 in|ches, nor the holes in them four in|ches.</P>
<P>This done, let your back bands, who&s;e u&s;e is to hold up the &s;ide Cords (if you Tramel all your Hor&s;es legs) be made of Girth web, lined with Flannel or the like, to prevent galling; but if you Tramel but two of his legs, Filleting or &s;trong Tape will &s;erve; but you mu&s;t be careful that it main|tains the &s;ide cords in an even line, with|out either twitching it up, or &s;uffering it to fall, for the&s;e are gro&s;s defects and great hindrances, for ri&s;ing &s;hortens the &s;ide cord, and falling makes it apt to intan|gle the Hor&s;e.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="33">
<P>This being the manner of making the right Tramel: I &s;hall now proceed to give my Reader a de&s;cription of its perfect u&s;e; as thus, bring your Hor&s;e into an even place, not too hard or &s;tony, and there putting on his ho&s;e on the near legs be|fore and behind; fa&s;ten to them the &s;ide cords, as afore&s;aid, the Hor&s;e &s;tanding as even as po&s;&s;ible, not &s;training forward nor crimpling inward, but to his ju&s;t and due pro|portion; lay the &s;ide ropes fa&s;tned by Girth|web or Tape to the Saddle, then laying your hand on the Bridle, oblige him by &s;train|ing his head gently to move forward, or if you perceive it requi&s;ite, let another a&s;&s;i&s;t you in forcing him forward, whiles you compel him to Amble about the ground, for that purpo&s;e cho&s;en, as lei&s;urely as po&s;&s;ibly, u&s;ing him with all gentlene&s;s and often cheri&s;hing him with your voice, till he feel the Tramel, and begin to under&s;tand what he is to perform: And although he &s;tum|ble or fall now and then, at his being brought to the Tramel, yet in a while he will grow perfect, if you be not too har&s;h towards him: But when he falls, rather cheri&s;h him, by permitting him to ri&s;e at his lei&s;ure, than &s;eem har&s;h towards him; for by that means he will find out his own failings, and amend them, and &s;oon under&s;tand the
<PB N="39" REF="33"> motion he is de&s;igned for; and in your hand Amble to your liking, though it is not ami&s;s if at fir&s;t, when he begins to learn, that you permit the &s;ide ropes to be longer than the mea&s;ure, before &s;pecified, to prevent the &s;uddain twiches, till he is u&s;ed to the Tramel; but when he begins to be perfect, be &s;ure they be of a con&s;tant length, le&s;t the over length render him a &s;low Ambler, or the under length cau&s;e him to halt or &s;huffle.</P>

<P>YOur Hor&s;e being brought perfectly to Amble by hand, you may change the half Tramel, removing it from one &s;ide, and placing it on the other, and as you &s;ee oc|ca&s;ion put on the whole Tramel, till he run &s;wiftly without the motion of &s;nappering or &s;tumbling, after which try him upon uneven and uncertain ways, up &amp; down hill, over clumpers and fal&s;e footing, that &s;o he may in his Amble an&s;wer all Roads; for di|vers Hor&s;es there are that will Amble &s;moothly and decently upon even ground, but when they happen upon rough and &s;tony ways, fall into a hard trot &s;huffling
<PB N="40" REF="34"> or an ill favoured pace, out of which it is very difficult to force them.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;e being thus tryed and no diffi|culty appearing, mount his back or &s;et ano|ther to do it, whil&s;t your &s;elf by &s;taying his head, keep him from any ill conveniency, and take a narrow view how he treads his &s;teps; after which, your &s;elf mounting him and often cheri&s;hing him, may oblige him, to mend his pace, till he move with as much agility as you can de&s;ire: yet forget not between whiles to put on &s;ometimes the half Tramel, and at other times the whole Tramel, often &s;hifting them from one &s;ide to the other, le&s;t your Hor&s;e &s;hould for|get his pace; and in &s;o doing twice or thrice a day, you will bring him in a Month or &s;ix weeks to the heighth of perfection.</P>
<P>Thus far having proceeded, you may without any Tramel ride him upon the road for three or four miles, not picking or chu&s;ing your way, but taking the uneven with the even, and if you perceive him to baulk his Amble, then having the half Tra|mel about you, put it on, which will &s;oon put him in mind of what he is to perform; but if you perceive any impediment that cau&s;ed him to for&s;ake his Amble, remove it, and then try him again without the Tramel; for there is nothing belonging
<PB N="41" REF="34"> to Hor&s;eman&s;hip that is not requi&s;ite to be u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, or to be left off as occa&s;ion requires, <HI>viz.</HI> the chain, Head|&s;train, Cavezan, Mu&s;roul, Martingal, Bit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And thus much touching what relates to in&s;truction for Ambling &s;hall &s;uffice, it not being in the lea&s;t to be que&s;tioned, but if the&s;e rules are ob&s;erved, the Reader will have his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>As to Trotting and Galloping, they are paces &s;o ordinary and &s;o ea&s;ie to be attain|ed, that I need not much inlarge on them, as for the Trot, it is of two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lofty or Prancing Trot, and the common or Running Trot. To oblige your Hor&s;e to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, you mu&s;t perfect him at the Po&s;t, as is before recited; after which putting on a &s;trong Curb-Bit, by bearing him up, &s;hortning your rein by twi&s;ting it about your Bridle hand, oblige him to bend his neck Arch|wi&s;e, not any ways inclining it to one &s;ide or the other, but foreright; and by u&s;ing him to it, he will at length keep his head and neck in the &s;ame po&s;ture when you ride him with a Snaffle, after which fa&s;ten a &s;trong &s;trap to his Girth under his belly, and bringing it between his forelegs, fa&s;ten it pretty &s;trait to the Curb, or Chain of the Bridle, and then mounting your
<PB N="42" REF="35"> Hor&s;e, hold the reins with a &s;teddy hand and cau&s;e your Hor&s;e to move forward, &s;ome|times &s;triking him upon the hinder thighs with your rod, and at other times cheri&s;h|ing him, at what time feeling his head &s;traitned, between the under and upper rein, he will lift his forefeet high, treading &s;hort in a proud prancing manner, which by often u&s;age will make him perfect in it; when the under rein is taken away. As for the other Trot, the grace of it being when it is &s;wift and &s;mooth, the only way is at the fir&s;t breaking of your Hor&s;e, to &s;et a full bodied man upon him, who&s;e weight will &s;o ballance him, that he cannot let his feet fall from &s;uch a height, or with &s;o &s;trong a &s;pring to jolt the Rider, by rea&s;on he will not be capable of lifting them &s;o high. Another way to oblige him to an ea&s;ie Trot, is by loading him at his fir&s;t bereaking with heavy &s;hoos, which will make him Trot more deliberately, and with le&s;s &s;ha|king his body, to offend his Rider.</P>
<P>As for Galloping, it is divided into two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> Hand-gallop, and Fullgal|lop, or Full-&s;peed, to either of which a skillful rider, by the mannagement of the rein, and u&s;e of Whip or Spur, may oblige a free Hor&s;e at his plea&s;ure: Wherfore I &s;hall no longer in&s;i&s;t on them, but conclude this

<HEAD>Rules to be well con&s;idered and exactly ob&s;erved by all that undertake the care of good Hor|&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>AMong&s;t other things appertaining to a Hor&s;e, good looking to is not the lea&s;t, for if he fare never &s;o well, if he be not carefully looked after, at all conveni|ent &s;ea&s;ons, he will not thrive; there|fore for their better under&s;tanding, to whom &s;uch offices appertain, I &s;hall lay down the&s;e following Rules.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Ri&s;ing in Summer-time about Sun ri&s;ing, and in Winter-time by break of day, enter the Stable, having over-night prepared three pints or thereabouts of dry Oats well &s;ifted, and added to them a pint of &s;plit Beans, give them your Hor&s;e, the which when he has eaten, fall to dre&s;&s;ing him, currying him over with your Iron Comb, leaving no part undone, then with your du&s;ting cloth du&s;t him over, or for want of that with a Hor&s;e tail, after which
<PB N="44" REF="36"> with your French bru&s;h beginning at his forehead, proceed by degrees to rub every part of him leaving not &s;o much as the breadth of an inch untouched throughout him; then du&s;t him again, and with your wet hand lay and &s;mooth his hair, then dry|ing your hand, dry the wet places with the &s;ame, not forgetting to clean&s;e his Sheath, Cods, Yard, Tuel, Forebowels, Ears, No&s;trils, and all other places that are &s;ubject, to &s;weat or filth; this done, with your hair-cloth rub him over in all parts, but e&s;pecially his Head, Cheeks, Face and Eyes, the top of his forehead and between his chaps, then with a woollen Cloth kept clean for that purpo&s;e, rub him over again in all parts, and la&s;tly comb down his Main and Tail.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;e thus put into good order, Sad|dle him and lead him out of the Stable, where mounting his back, ride him gently to water, but &s;o that you may a little warm his &s;tomach: then having permitted him to drink a con&s;iderable draught, Rack him gently ere you bring him into the Sta|ble; having done that, though not made him &s;weat, bring him into the Stable, ha|ving his cloaths ready; as &s;oon as you have rubbed him down, put them on, and &s;o let him &s;tand for the &s;pace of an hour, at
<PB N="45" REF="36"> which time give him two quarts of Beans and Oats mingled as afore&s;aid, which being eaten, to&s;s into his Rack a hard knop of hay, and let him bite upon it till noon; noon being come, furni&s;h him with the like quantity of Beans and Oats and the like knop of Hay, if the former knop be eaten, or el&s;e not.</P>
<P>Evening being come, carefully dre&s;s him, after the &s;ame manner as in the morning you did, and &s;o ride him to wa|ter, warming him before you permit him, to drink, as likewi&s;e afterwards bring him into the Stable, clothing him and rub|bing him down without any alteration, and after an hours &s;tanding give him Beans, Oats and Hay to the quantity afore&s;aid; that is three pints of Oats one of &s;pelt Beans, and a knop of Hay, and let him &s;tand till Nine of the Clock at night, at what time renewing his Bait, and to&s;&s;ing up his Litter, leave him till morning.</P>

<P>WHen you intend to take a journey, &s;ee the day and night before, that your Hor&s;e have his due proportion of
<PB N="46" REF="37"> meat, and be well rubbed down, clean Littered, and &s;erved with warm water in the Stable without leading him abroad; and either with Trotters, oyl Neatsfoot-Oyl, or Dogs Greace, which it behoves you to have in a readine&s;s, &s;upple the joynts of fore and hinderlegs, it being warmed over a fire, which will not only make him nimble in his Travail, but hold out much better than otherwi&s;e he would. In the morn|ing let him have his Beans and Oats, but no Hay. If you find him lively and met|tle&s;ome, give him no water before you ride out, but being mounted ride him a mile or two, a racking pace, and when you find him well heated, ride him as you plea&s;e, either Amble, Trot or Full-&s;peed, you cannot hurt him; but be &s;ure to ob|&s;erve when you come into your Inn, that you with your Glazing Knife ere you rub him down, take off the &s;weat) the knife &s;o called, is made of an old Sword blade or a piece of a Scithe) after which rub him down, and clean&s;e him as you have been formerly &s;hewed. Then he having eaten his allowance of meat, which mu&s;t for conveniencies &s;ake be double what at once you are to give him when he &s;tands idle; you mu&s;t if you find him any thing hot, give him warm water, but if he be
<PB N="47" REF="37"> indifferent cool, cold water will not pre|judice him.</P>
<P>Having after a journey, heat, or the like, brought home your Hor&s;e, hot or tyred, bring him not into the Stable till he be pretty well dryed, and cooled by mode|rate walking; when being entred the Stable, and tyed up to the Rack, rub him down as you have been &s;hewed before, and girt his cloaths fa&s;t about him: Tucking &s;ome drie wi&s;ps between his body and the Girths, and when he has &s;tood on the Bridle for the &s;pace of two hours; to&s;s a knop of Hay into the Rack, whil&s;t you prepare your Oats and Beans to the quantity of two quarts, among&s;t which it will not at all be ami&s;s, but rather profitable, if you mix half a pint of Hemp&s;eed well clean&s;ed; and at night when he comes to receive his la&s;t bait, give him warm water mix|ed with a &s;mall quantity of fine Oat|meal, and &s;o to&s;&s;ing up his Litter let him re&s;t till Morning.</P>
<P>As to wa&s;hing and walking your Hor&s;e after a journey; I hold them both dange|rous; the former occa&s;ioning &s;urfeits, and the latter contagious colds turning into the Glanders, and other both trouble&s;ome and noy&s;ome infirmities. But if he be extraordinary dirty, take a pail of warm

<HEAD>Rules to be ob&s;erved in preparing and order|ing your Hor&s;e de&s;igned to Run, according to the condition he is in, and the temper of his body.</HEAD>
<PB N="49" REF="38">
<P>THe chief thing, when you have match|ed your Hor&s;e, or are about to match him, that is requi&s;ite to be ob&s;erved, is the &s;tate of his body; but e&s;pecially whether he be Foul, Fat, or newly taken from Soil, or Gra&s;s; whether through exce&s;&s;ive riding or other hard u&s;age, he be reduced to leanne&s;s or affli|cted with any infirmitie; or whether he is in a good and likely condition, through kindly u&s;age and gentle breathings: and according to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, proportion your time, in order to fit and prepare your Hor&s;e to per|form your de&s;ire. Two months being the longe&s;t time you need de&s;ire, be he in the wor&s;t of the conditions afore&s;aid, if the following in&s;tructions be exactly ob&s;erved, the wor&s;t of which is his being Foul and Fat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by rea&s;on the Grea&s;e mu&s;t be brought away, before he can be fit, for this extraordi|nary exerci&s;e; &s;ix weeks, if he be lean, for then his feeding and exerci&s;e need not be di&s;tinct in days, but every day both of them put in practice, as for a Hor&s;e in good ca&s;e, and free from infirmity: I hold that a month is &s;ufficient, if he be carefully looked after to prepare him.</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;idered, the next is to ob&s;erve whether your Hor&s;e, if fat, by extraordinary exerci&s;e, is &s;o tender that he
<PB N="50" REF="39"> lo&s;es his fle&s;h and falls away; if &s;o, you mu&s;t be more moderate in your exer|ci&s;e, and tender over him; but if you find him hardy, and of a free &s;pirit, then you mu&s;t keep him up to it, and he will prove the better. Again, if your lean Hor&s;e be of a free temper, and feeding upon all meats, will get his fle&s;h up apace, and not lo&s;e it by exerci&s;e; then you need not be &s;o ten|der over him, and the like mu&s;t be ob&s;er|ved by your Hor&s;e in the middle &s;tate, al|ways taking &s;pecial notice of their Limbs; that there harbour no defect; for if &s;o, your labour will be greatly hazzarded, if not altogether lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus far proceeded, I &s;hall now lay down Rules for dieting your Hor&s;e, in preparing for your match, and by rea&s;on that all the three before mentioned may be &s;aid to be contained in the fat Hor&s;e; I &s;hall fir&s;t begin with him.</P>

<HEAD>The manner of the fir&s;t fortnights diet for a Hor&s;e that is fat and foul, or upon his be|ing taken from &s;oil or gra&s;s, and what is nece&s;&s;ary therein to be ob&s;erved.</HEAD>
<P>YOur fat and foul Hor&s;e, made &s;o by either &s;tanding at &s;oil, or running at gra&s;s, too high feeding or the like: If you have matched him, or intend &s;o to do; when you have brought him into your Stable,
<PB N="51" REF="39"> to prepare him for the Race, ri&s;ing early the fir&s;t fortnight, you mu&s;t fir&s;t of all, having rou&s;ed him, if he be laid, wa&s;h his Bridle in Beer or Ale, tie it to the rack; and clean&s;e the Stable of the Hor&s;es ex|crements, and then exceedingly well dre&s;s him. For the manner whereof, to avoid repetition, I refer you to be guided by tho&s;e Rules, I have laid down in the Office of the Keeper, in the Chapter of this book, unle&s;s what is nece&s;&s;ary to be ad|ded, as being in this ca&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, though in the general way of dre&s;&s;ing, not great|ly material, which principally relate to your Hor&s;es cloathing. For by rea&s;on the Heats in preparing your Hor&s;e for this exerci&s;e, mu&s;t be more, and frequenter than upon any other occa&s;ion: So therefore mu&s;t the care be great, to prevent his catch|ing cold; falling into a &s;urfeit or the like. When you have well dre&s;&s;ed him in the morning, and clean&s;ed him from filth, leaving no part about him untouched, as afore&s;aid, having a large body-cloth made of &s;trong warm Ker&s;ie, if the weather be cold; or if hot, Cotten, or other light &s;oft &s;tuff will &s;erve: Fold it about his body, and putting on his Saddle, let his foremo&s;t girth be girded clo&s;e, but the other loo&s;e, thru&s;ting in large &s;oft wi&s;ps of Straw near his
<PB N="52" REF="40"> heart, that &s;o the &s;lack girth may by the help of the wi&s;ps be made &s;trait as the o|ther: then put on a warm brea&s;t cloth, &s;o that it may cover his &s;houlders. When having &s;pirted about three or four &s;ponfulls of beer into his mouth; then leaving one to prepare the Stable again&s;t your return, lead him forth, and after a turn or two in your hand, mount his back, and rack him gently, for the &s;pace of a mile or more, up|on plain and even ground, till you can, if po&s;&s;ible, come to &s;ome &s;teep Hill, a&s;cend|ing gradually, up which gallop him mo|derately, and being come to the top, or &s;o high as you think convenient; Rack or walk him down again, that, by that means he may cool as much in de&s;cend|ing, as he heated in a&s;cending; and having after this manner pretty well exerci&s;ed him, it being yet early in the morning, lead him or ride him a moderate pace to &s;ome plea&s;ant River, Spring or other &s;weet run|ning water, and &s;uffer him to drink as much as he plea&s;es, but if he altogether refu&s;es to drink, then moderately exerci&s;e him; as afore&s;aid, but if he refu&s;e to drink, warm him by riding gently, to provoke him to thir&s;t.</P>
<P>When your Hor&s;e has drank his fill, rack
<PB N="53" REF="40"> him gently homewards, &s;o that he may come into the Stable without a wet hair; the &s;table being fre&s;h littered with Wheat-Straw (for Barly, or Rye Straw are both nought: the one cau&s;ing heart burning and the other &s;cowring) by whi&s;tling and &s;tretching your Hor&s;e upon the ca&s;t out Litter, indeavour to make him void urine, the which if he at fir&s;t decline to do, yet at la&s;t, by often u&s;age, he under&s;tanding what is re|quired of him, will do it freel, and by &s;o do|ing pre&s;erve the &s;table clean, and render it more healthy: this done and your Hor&s;e entred the Stable, keeping his head in the bridle, tye it up to the Rack, then with hard wi&s;ps, rub down his legs with all your &s;trength; then taking off his bre&s;t-cloth, rub his head, neck and brea&s;t, with care and diligence, with a dry cloth, after which take off his Saddle, and hang it up, rubbing the place where it &s;at, as likewi&s;e all the other parts of his body. His body cloth being taken off, and when you have &s;uffici|ently rubbed him, leaving no place un|touched, cloath him again, fir&s;t by &s;pread|ing a Linnen cloth over him, and girding it about him; upon that a warm hou&s;ing cloth, and over both the Woollen body-cloth, which in winter mu&s;t be lined with Cotten, or &s;ome other warm &s;tuff; but in
<PB N="54" REF="41"> Summer it matters not whether it be lined or no, for the Ker&s;ie will then prove &s;uffi|cient. This done wi&s;p him round with &s;oft wi&s;ps, though large, that &s;o when he is di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;t, he may lie ea&s;ie. From this proceed to pick his feet, and ha|ving cleared them of the Gravel or dirt, &s;top them with Cowdung; and throw in|to his Rack a &s;mall bottle of Hay, not exceeding three pound, and let it be well du&s;ted, the which let him eat, and &s;tand up|on the Bridle for the &s;pace of an hour and half; then cleaning the Manger of du&s;t and Hay&s;eeds, take about a quart of large white Oats, commonly known by the name of <HI>Poland</HI> Oats, or cut Oats, the&s;e above all others being the whole&s;ome&s;t, the re&s;t &s;ome being un&s;weet breed infirmities, other&s;ome being moi&s;t breed Worms in the belly; new Oats occa&s;ion &s;welling, and Black-Oats wor&s;t of all cau&s;e ill di|ge&s;tion and bad humours, thereby &s;o di&s;|colouring the dung, that the &s;tate of the Hor&s;es body is not thereby to be known.</P>
<P>The quantity of Oats afore&s;aid, well dryed, put into a Riddle or Sieve, called a reeing &s;ieve, &s;o big as it will permit the &s;mall and light Oats to pa&s;s through, and retain the large and &s;olid ones; and by reeing them after they are throughly clean&s;ed, give
<PB N="55" REF="41"> them your Hor&s;e to eat in the Manger, it being made clean, as afore&s;aid. If he eat them heartily, and &s;eem de&s;irous of more, you may then give him another like quantity &s;o ordered, and then permit him to &s;tand or lie down at his plea&s;ure, till about Eleven of the Clock. At which time, coming to vi&s;it him, rub down his Head, Neck, Face and Che&s;t; and give him about three pints of Oats ordered as before; and then making the Stable as clo&s;e and dark as you can, leave him for the &s;pace of two hours, for the clo&s;er the Stable is, and the darker the Hor&s;e &s;tands, the better will he take his re&s;t, and dige&s;t his food: Therefore many hang their Stalls round and over head with Canvas, or other thick cloaths. Nor is it ami&s;s, for it not only darkens the place, but prevents any noi&s;ome thing from falling into their Provender, as Lime Spiders, du&s;t, and the like.</P>
<P>The two hours ended, acco&s;t him again, with the like quantity of Oats as before; dre&s;t and prepared, after the &s;ame manner, rubbing over his Head, Face, Neck and Brea&s;t with a clean cloth; and if he hath dunged, carry it forth, and ca&s;t up his Litter, which done, ca&s;t a knop of Hay into his Rack, leave him for three hours more; if in Summer; but if in Winter two
<PB N="56" REF="42"> hours, or two and a half; at the expiration of which time, vi&s;it him again, and with|out giving him any meat, wa&s;h his Bridle in Beer, and put it on; taking off his cloaths by degrees, and rubbing him all over in the manner as has been formerly &s;hewed; then clapping on his Saddle, bring him forth, and endeavour to make him empty him&s;elf upon the old Litter; and &s;o mount his back gently, Racking him for an hour, or thereabout, and then if po&s;&s;ible give him his breathings, along the &s;ide of &s;ome plea|&s;ant River; but do not gallop him up any hill, for that upon a full &s;tomach, will in|danger his Wind; &s;o that ob&s;erve to let his evening breathings be in &s;mooth &s;olid ground as you can chu&s;e: and heat him both before and after water, as in the Morning, letting him &s;mell to all the old or new Hor&s;e dung you find in the way, which will not only provoke him to empty, but &s;harpen his appetite, and &s;o continuing him abroad till night approach, (for early and late Airings are the mo&s;t proper to di|mini&s;h the foulne&s;s, and di&s;per&s;e the gro&s;s humours) bring him home, and having cau&s;ed him to empty at the Stable door, draw his Bridle, clean&s;e the Manger, and at all points dre&s;s him, and rub him down as in the morning, and then giving him a

<P>Grind three Pecks of Beans, with one Peck of Wheat into fine flower or Meal, dre&s;&s;ed through an indifferent fine range, and made up with &s;weet Ye&s;t, and a little &s;pring water, kneaded very painfuly and through|ly, and &s;uffer it then to lie in the trough a &s;pace to ri&s;e and become light; then knead it again, and &s;o make it into loaves, as big as &s;ixpeny ones, and let them &s;oak well in an Oven; then taken out hot turn them the up &s;ide down, and &s;uffer them in that manner to cool.</P>
<P>Three days after the baking and not before, for fear of &s;urfeiting your Hor&s;e, you may cut the bread into thin &s;hivings, and laying it a while to dry, put in among&s;t the Oats, crumbling it &s;mall, and give it your Hor&s;e, not exceeding more bread than a pound and a half at a time, the Oats you mix it with being carefully &s;ifted.

<PB N="67" REF="47"> follow with your bru&s;h, and then du&s;t him well, and let all his body again be rubbed over with dry cloaths, then putting his cloaths on again, tru&s;s him on either &s;ide with warm wi&s;ps, and ca&s;t over him a loo&s;e blanket, after which give him nothing more for the &s;pace of two hours, all which time you mu&s;t watch him, and as near as you can, keep him in continual motion, it being dangerous to permit him to &s;tand &s;till, or &s;leep upon the reception of this potion, and be&s;ides, it will not &s;o well operate up|on the crude gro&s;s humours, unle&s;s the Hor&s;e be &s;till moving.</P>
<P>At the end of two hours, or if you &s;ee occa&s;ion, &s;omewhat more, give him a hand|ful of Wheat ears, &s;uch as are not beard|ed, if you find upon your handling him on his Fillets, near his Heart, under his Ears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that no new &s;weat ari&s;es, but that he is in good temper; but if the contrary, then for|bear to give him ought; for then the foulne&s;s appearing by the &s;wift beating of the heart, the new &s;weat and other &s;ym|ptoms are mightily &s;tirred up, it is con|venient they &s;hould operate without the lea&s;t mole&s;tation, though your Hor&s;e thereupon appear to be &s;ick and faint; to ea&s;e which, you may take off his Bridle, to&s;s up his Litter, and leave him to take
<PB N="68" REF="48"> his re&s;t for the &s;pace of two hours or there|about, at the end of which his &s;ickne&s;s will vani&s;h.</P>
<P>The wheat ears eaten by five or &s;ix at a time, give him a knop of Hay, rubbing him again, e&s;pecially his head; about an hour after mix a quarter of Oats, a pint of &s;pelt-beans and three &s;hivers of the afore&s;aid bread, well chipped and &s;mall crumbled and give them to him, letting him re&s;t af|ter the eating them for the &s;pace of three hours.</P>
<P>The three hours expired, vi&s;it him again, and before you dre&s;s him, give him a like quantity of Oats, Beans and Bread, and then dre&s;&s;ing well, put on his cloathes and ride him not far, neither &s;uffer him to drink; but about an hour and a half afterwards wa&s;h three pints of Oats in Ale or Beer and give them to him to cool him, which will be a great means to repel the inward heat; and feeding at his u&s;ual times plenti|fully, and leaving a knop of Hay in his Rack, you may &s;uffer him to re&s;t till mor|ning, when ri&s;ing early you mu&s;t dre&s;s him at all points, and ride him forth to water, giving him a gentle breathing, and upon his return to the Stable give him Oats and &s;pelt Beans well &s;ifted together with the Bread, to the quantity of two quarts
<PB N="69" REF="48"> permitting him to have but little Hay.</P>
<P>Thus having ordered him diligently, ob&s;erve the three other heating days, up|on each of which after he has performed his, heat &s;till improving his &s;peed and rea|dine&s;s, give him the afore&s;aid &s;couring potion, which will infallibly carry away the foulne&s;s, and gro&s;s humours, rendering your Hor&s;e plea&s;ant and light&s;ome, and thus having laid down rules and in&s;tructions for the fir&s;t and &s;econd Fortnight, I &s;hall proceed to the third.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Dyet for the third Fortnight, how it mu&s;t be made, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MIngle together half a bu&s;hel of the be&s;t Wheat, and a like quantity of Beans, grind them as &s;mall as may be, and dre&s;s the meal finer than the former, even as fine as po&s;&s;ible, and make it into Dough, with &s;weet ye&s;t, and ri&s;ing kneading it &s;o well that a knot or kop may not be found in it, and bake it throughly, cooling it, the Loaves proportionable to tho&s;e before mentioned, with the bottoms upward, and at three days old chip it; that is, cut away the cru&s;t, and &s;o with a like quantity of Oats, Beans, and of the &s;aid Bread, as for|merly has been pre&s;cribed, feed your
<PB N="70" REF="49"> Hor&s;e; and as you did in the precedent fort|night; &s;o in this let your mea&s;ures in every re&s;pect, be one and the &s;ame, barring the&s;e following exceptions.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t his heats mu&s;t be more moderate for fear of too much &s;training him, and the bettter to let him take plea&s;ure therein.</P>
<P>Secondly, Omit the &s;couring, not giving him any more after his heats, le&s;t his body by this time freed from the gro&s;s humours being too much opened by the operation of the purgation, contract cold and watery humours; but having moderately heated him, bring him home, cooling by gentle racking; and having cau&s;ed him to empty him&s;elf, bring him into the Stable, tie him to the Rack, give him a Cordial ball about the bigne&s;s of a French Walnut, or Tennis ball, if he can &s;wallow it. The receipt to make them is as followeth.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To make Cordial balls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TAke Anni&s;eed, Fenegreek&s;eed, Car|thumus&s;eed, Cumin&s;eed, Coltsfoot and Elecampane-roots, of each two ounces, brui&s;ed &amp; &s;ier&s;ed: The husks and gro&s;s part being &s;eparated from the re&s;t, add to them two ounces of Brim&s;tone-flower, an ounce of the Juice of Liquori&s;h put into half a pint of White-wine, then take an ounce of the
<PB N="71" REF="49"> Chimical Oyl of Anni&s;eed, Sugar, Syr|rup and Salad Oyl, of each half a pint: the&s;e ingredients thus prepared, mix with them &s;o much Wheat-flower as will mould them into a pa&s;t, and make them up into balls as big as Walnuts, Hen-eggs or the like, and keep them in clo&s;e earthen Pots for your u&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e balls are good to cure any violent Cold or Glaunders; to prevent &s;ickne&s;s at heart cau&s;ed by infection or ill dige&s;tion, to purge away all Molten grea&s;e, to recover a lo&s;t &s;tomach, to keep the Hor&s;e from faint|ing with exerci&s;e, and to fatten a lean Hor&s;e to admiration: And thus much as to the third fortnights dyet.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Rules to be ob&s;erved in the fourth or la&s;t fort|nights keeping, as well in relation to his Dyet as u&s;age.</HEAD>
<P>IN this la&s;t Fortnight you mu&s;t be more circum&s;pect than in the former, and the fir&s;t thing to be ob&s;erved, is in ma|king his bread a degree finer after this man|ner.</P>
<P>To three pecks of fine Wheat well &s;ifted put a peck of Beans cleared from the hulls, and grind them together, dre&s;&s;ing the flow|er through a Bolter as fine as po&s;&s;ible, ma|king it up with &s;weet Ale-ye&s;t or Barm,
<PB N="72" REF="50"> and as much Ale as will wet it and make it plyable; then add the whites of twenty Eggs or thereabout, together with new milk, not putting any water into it, then knead it again, and having make it into rea&s;onable big loaves, bake them well and cool them with the under-cru&s;t uppermo&s;t.</P>
<P>The&s;e loaves baked and cooled, after three days cut off the Cru&s;t, and with Oats well dryed and rubbed between your hands, being al&s;o winnowed and &s;ifted, and a quan|tity of the be&s;t &s;pelt Beans; bait your Hor&s;e, cutting the bread, and ob&s;erving the quantities of each as in the foregoing fort|nights.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t week of this fortnight, you &s;hall ob&s;erve the heating days as before, but in the la&s;t week you mu&s;t bate one heat, not permitting him to take any heat for the &s;pace of five days before the match is to be run, yet may you give him con&s;iderable Airings to keep up his wind, ob&s;erving that you do not by any means give him a &s;cou|ring, but the better to expel the fumes or vapours that may offend him, burn in the Stable Storax, Albanum or Frankincen&s;e upon a Chafing-di&s;h of Charcoal or &s;mall coal, in the &s;cent of which he will take great delight. If at any time in this fort|night you de&s;ign to moi&s;ten his meat as it
<PB N="73" REF="50"> is every five or &s;ix givings convenient, then let it be done with Mu&s;cadel, in which the whites of Eggs have been beaten, and it will the better hearten him to per|form his cour&s;e; as for Hay give him none, unle&s;s a &s;mall quantity after his heatings, which you mu&s;t give him out of your hand, let it be well du&s;ted and exceeding good.</P>
<P>The &s;econd week of the la&s;t fortnight, unle&s;s your Hor&s;e be a very foul feeder, you need not u&s;e the Muzzel till three days before the Match is to be run, but if he be a foul feeder and covet to eat his Lit|ter, bite the Rack-&s;taves, or the like, then put it on the beginning of the week and let it continue on at convenient times till the time he is to run.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve to feed your Hor&s;e well, both before and after Airing; the morning be|fore the day you de&s;ign to run for the wager, let his waterings be as formerly; but as for his meat let it be &s;cantied a fourth part, both before noon and after.</P>
<P>Before your Evening Airings, and after be &s;ure to feed as at noon, but be &s;ure &s;tay not abroad till Sun&s;et.</P>
<P>Let him be this day, being the day be|fore the Match, well &s;hod, cooled, and all other things requi&s;ite, that on the day he is
<PB N="74" REF="51"> to run, nothing may be left to do, thereby to trouble or di&s;turb him, though &s;ome hold that the Hor&s;e being dre&s;&s;ed and &s;hod with light &s;hoos will be &s;o &s;en&s;ible of what he is to perform the next day, that for pride he will neither eat nor &s;leep; but this under&s;tanding can only remain in an old Hor&s;e-Racing Hor&s;e, who has been often u&s;ed to the &s;port, and not in any other; therefore in that ca&s;e 'tis my opinion the offices are better deferred till the morning of the day he is to run; but if otherwi&s;e, let them be done over-night, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The breading of the Tail, by many is held both an ornament and a help to the Hor&s;e in his running, though according to the opinions of the mo&s;t inqui&s;itive into that affair, it rather hinders than furthers his &s;peed, by rea&s;on that in &s;training the twi&s;ts, drawing the roots of the hairs, put him to pain, and create an unu&s;ual heavine&s;s, which makes him &s;uppo&s;e that a weight or &s;omething el&s;e is fa&s;tned to his tail, there|fore unle&s;s it be exceeding long and large it would do better to hang loo&s;e.</P>
<P>On the morning of the day, your match is to be performed, come to your Hor&s;e pretty betimes, and having taken off his Muzzel, rub his head well, as likewi&s;e his
<PB N="75" REF="51"> Neck, Shoulders and Legs; then take a quantity of Oats, Ma&s;h them in Mu&s;ca|del, and give them to him to eat, the which if he refu&s;e, then moi&s;ten another quantity with Whites of Eggs, but if tho&s;e will not go down with him, then give him Oats well dryed and &s;ifted, mixed with a &s;mall quantity of Wheat, or a &s;hiving or two of your fine&s;t Bread well crumbled with them; but no Beans, let the quantity be very &s;mall, le&s;t it hinder his running. If he be an evil emptier, then lead him to &s;uch places as he u&s;ually empties at, and provoke him thereto: but if he is not &s;ubject long to contain his food, but will empty freely, then you need not move him out of the Stable to empty, but there expect notice when to bring him forth to the Match.</P>
<P>When you receive the warning, wa&s;h his Snaffle in Mu&s;cadel, and having taken away the Muzzel, put it on: if you perceive any wind to move in your Hor&s;es belly, by rea&s;on of his emptine&s;s, give him four or five mouth|fuls of the meat la&s;t &s;poken of; and then pitch|ing your Saddle and Girths with &s;hoomakers wax, put it upon his back, gently girding it on that he may &s;carcely feel it, or at lea&s;t, not &s;o as in any wi&s;e to &s;traiten him: over his Sad|dle put a white Linnen cloth; upon that his ordinary cloaths; and over all, the better
<PB N="76" REF="52"> to &s;et him, and make him proud of him|&s;elf, you may lay a Counterpain or piece of Arras: and &s;o giving him a do&s;e of Mu&s;|cadel, in a &s;mall drenching horn, proceed to the place intended for &s;tarting.</P>
<P>In the way permit him to &s;mell to any Hor&s;e dung, new or old, to provoke him the better to empty, which will be a great advantage to him in his running: If he re|fu&s;e to empty, then lead him among&s;t Ru&s;hes, Brakes or Sedge, and thereby whi&s;t|ling provoke him to it: but if that prevail not, then take out &s;ome of the wi&s;ps he is tru&s;&s;ed with, and break them under him.</P>
<P>If in your leading him, any foam or froth ari&s;e in his mouth or el&s;ewhere, wipe it away with a clean Linnen-cloth, and wa&s;h it with dipping it in water, which you &s;hall carry with you for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If you are to ride with any per&s;on, who by rea&s;on of his being lighter than your &s;elf, or that gives you any advantage, &s;o that there are weights in the ca&s;e to make both equal, or otherwi&s;e, as the agree|ment is, then ob&s;erve that he carries not tho&s;e weights in his Saddle, but &s;ome|where about him&s;elf, for if he carry them in the Saddle, they will neither hinder him nor prejudice the Hor&s;e, but be as if he did
<PB N="77" REF="52"> carry none, and then you had as good ride with him on equal terms: but if your agree|ment be that he &s;hall carry them about him, then is the advantage much on your &s;ide.</P>
<P>As to the ground you mu&s;t likewi&s;e have &s;pecial regard, which you mu&s;t take from your heats and breathings, that is, take no|tice whether your Hor&s;e affects high or low ground, hard or &s;oft, and if you can po&s;&s;ibly without any &s;ignal di&s;advantage, keep him to &s;uch ground in his cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;ider, and all things brought to a point; when you are arri|ved at the &s;tarting Po&s;t, uncloath your Hor&s;e, rub well his legs with wi&s;ps, clean&s;e his feet, and &s;pirt cool water into his mouth, then mount your rider.</P>
<Q><L>Then &s;tarting fair, force on without controle,</L>

If he be troubled with cold &s;weats, often lying down, and re&s;t|le&s;s when he is down, often looking on his body, alteration in his carriage and going; not ca&s;ting his Coat in due &s;ea|&s;on, or being hidebound. If I &s;ay, you per|ceive any of the&s;e &s;ymptoms in your Hor&s;e, then is it your care to inquire from what cau&s;e it ari&s;es, and apply the cures which for the di&s;tempers before men|tioned, I &s;hall hereafter pre&s;cribe.</P>

<P>If it be well coloured, yet if it fall from the Hor&s;e in round hard balls, as near as may be of a bigne&s;s, then it denotes your Hor&s;e evilly fed, having too much Hay, too little Corn, and permitted to feed too much upon his Litter.</P>
<P>If it fall in round knops, hard, and of colour black, or brown, it denotes exce&s;s of heat in the body of your Hor&s;e; if it appear grea&s;ie, it denotes foulne&s;s, and that in him remains Molten grea&s;e, that cannot find a pa&s;&s;age out: If with his Dung he voids grea&s;e, that is white and clear, then it de|notes that the Molten, and foul grea&s;e will kindly come away; but if you perceive it putrified or corrupted, which you may by its yellowne&s;s, then it betokens by rea|&s;on of the length of its continuance in the Hor&s;es body, corruption and putrefaction,

<HEAD>What is to be ob&s;erved from the &s;tate of your Hor&s;es body.</HEAD>
<P>IN the outward appearance of a Hor&s;e, there is nothing more common than for &s;ome men to be deceived: Therefore it will not be ami&s;s, if I lay down &s;ome rules worthy of ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then there are &s;ome Hor&s;es round, plump, and to appearance fat and well fle&s;hed, when they are nothing &s;o, the cau&s;e of which delu&s;ion ari&s;es from their being &s;hort from Head to Tail; well &s;et, large buttock|ed, well &s;houldered, and full &s;ided.</P>
<P>Secondly, there are &s;ome Hor&s;es that al|though they be in good ca&s;e, yet they will to the eye appear lean, and their Ribs ap|pear bare, nay when they are fat, foul, and full of grea&s;e and gro&s;s humours; and there|by many skilful Jockies have been deceiv|ed, as likewi&s;e Farriers, who &s;uppo&s;ing them to be in good ca&s;e, have neglected to apply tho&s;e remedies which were needfull, till
<PB N="83" REF="55"> &s;uch time as the humours have ingendered divers di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Many Hor&s;es will appear to be fat and foggy, by the out&s;ide, when inward|ly they are clean and in good order, and &s;o on the contrary, a Hor&s;e that appears lean will often be gro&s;s and foul within, as is &s;aid. Now to Remedy this over&s;ight, handle your Hor&s;e diligently on the Ribs, and more particularly on his hindmo&s;t &s;hort-ribs, and ob&s;erve well that if the fle&s;h feel loo&s;e and &s;oft, that your fingers dent in without much &s;tre&s;s, then conclude your Hor&s;e to be foul; if it prove firm and hard on all other places, the hinder Rib excepted, then is he more foul and full of Molten grea&s;e, and evil humours, which mu&s;t be voided by &s;couring and exerci&s;e, the latter to di&s;&s;olve it, and the former to bring it away, though the Hor&s;e to the eye appear poor and ill favoured.</P>
<P>If you upon &s;earch find your Hor&s;e to be fat, thick, and to feeling, as it were, clo&s;e between the Chaps, or his Jaws appear to be over fle&s;hy, bearing out, it denotes much foulne&s;s, in both head and bo|dy; but if he be thin, clean, and here and there lumps or kernels are to be felt within his chaps, it only denotes cold newly

<PB N="92" REF="60"> his pace; and if he treads &s;hort, he rids no more ground than if he went a round foot pace; if he treads rough, it denotes roul|ing in a &s;huffling manner, and is a fal&s;e pace, which by &s;ome unskilfull man|nager has been taught him, and &s;o it is that he will &s;oon fall out of into a Trot, or in a &s;hort time forget it.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Gallop.</HEAD>
<P>THe Gallop is a motion exceeding ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and is mo&s;t appropriated to Trotting Hor&s;es, becau&s;e that fal|ling
<PB N="93" REF="60"> out of their Trot, they have no other pace but the Gallop, as likewi&s;e a Hor&s;e well u&s;ed to Racking, will naturally take this motion: but the Pacer above all is the mo&s;t awkard to be brought to it, though in a while with good u&s;age and gentle in|&s;tructions he will take it exceeding well: the cau&s;e why at fir&s;t he is aver&s;e to this mo|tion, is, for that he having been trained to a &s;et pace; when he is forced to a &s;wifter motion &s;omewhat of the like nature, he by &s;training to &s;wiften his pace, &s;cambles with his legs, but when he under&s;tands the alteration, which he will after a months u&s;age, he will be prone enough to take it upon all occa&s;ions; yet too much Gallop|ping will prove prejudicial to his Pacing, and render it more hard by rea&s;on of &s;train|ing; therefore, in my opinion it would be be&s;t for them that can afford it, to keep a Hor&s;e for every motion. In Gallopping e&s;pecially, the&s;e things are to be ob&s;erved, that from the ground he rai&s;es his feet nimbly, but not too high. That he neither rouleth nor beateth him&s;elf; but that &s;tretching out his forelegs, his hinderlegs keep time cleaverly and &s;wiftly, that he neither cutteth under his knee, neither cro&s;|&s;eth nor &s;trikes one foot again&s;t another, but with his far &s;ore-foot &s;till leadeth. If he
<PB N="94" REF="61"> have the&s;e vertues, he is a true thorough|paced Gallopper. If your Hor&s;e Gallop &s;hort and round, rai&s;ing his forefeet, it de|notes him &s;trong, but not &s;wift, and is mo&s;t fit for the Wars. If he Gallop &s;low and &s;ure, then appropriate him to Travail; but if you perceive he handles his feet confu&s;ed, and &s;eems to Gallop painfully, it denotes his &s;inews &s;hrunk, and he will never prove a Gallopper, but will be &s;ubject to lamene&s;s: and thus much &s;hall &s;uffice as to the motions of Hor&s;es.</P>

<P>THe Buyer in the Stature of a Hor&s;e mu&s;t con&s;ider his ability, according to the imployment or u&s;e he de&s;igns him; the bigge&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t are fit for laborious im|ployments, as Drawing, carrying of burthens, double carriage, and the like. The Hor&s;es of a middle Stature are fitte&s;t for the Saddle of plea&s;ure, and the &s;maller for &s;uch u&s;es as they are capable to &s;erve to. As for the Marks to be ob&s;erved by the buyer, either of goodne&s;s or badne&s;s, they are many, and &s;o numerous are the defects in Hor&s;es, that they cannot without great curio&s;ity and narrow ob&s;ervance be deciphered. There|fore
<PB N="95" REF="61"> I &s;hall lay down divers general Rules, the which being well ob&s;erved will pre|vent many deceits.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Then if you de&s;ign to purcha&s;e, after you have &s;atisfied your &s;elf in his breed, colour, &s;tature, and motion, by the Rules afore&s;aid. Then his Saddle and cloaths being off, &s;tand ju&s;t before him, take a &s;trict view of his Countenance, and the chearfulne&s;s of his Face, for according to the chearfulne&s;s or dullne&s;s thereof is your Hor&s;e to be va|lued, the one pre&s;aging his goodne&s;s, and the other his badne&s;s.</P>
<P>Secondly, Ob&s;erve his Ears, if they be &s;harp, thin, pricked and &s;mall, always &s;tanding or moving, or if they be &s;omewhat long, well &s;et on, well carried, and no ways lolling, then is it a mark of beauty, com|line&s;s and goodne&s;s; but on the contrary, &s;igns of dullne&s;s, indi&s;po&s;ition, and of a &s;urly temper.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If his face be lean, his forehead bearing or &s;welling outward; the Mark or Feather in his Face &s;et high above his eyes, or &s;et on the top of his eyes; if he have a Star of white in his forehead, or a white &s;treak, a &s;nip of white on his no&s;e or lip, it denotes goodne&s;s in the Hor&s;e. But if his face be dull, heavy, cloudy, his forehead flat, and his head big and fat, and have none of the
<PB N="96" REF="62"> before&s;aid marks of goodne&s;s, then he is nought; and although he have tho&s;e marks, yet if his Star or &s;treak &s;tand awry, and where the &s;nip is, or &s;hould be; his no&s;e be bald or the like, then is he notwith&s;tand|ing of an evil Breed and defective.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Ob&s;erve that his eyes are large, round, black, &s;parkling, and that the black of the eye fills the pit of the outward circum|ference, &s;o that little white is vi&s;ible, then it betokens beauty and goodne&s;s; but if his eyes are uneven, look askew, wrinkled or &s;mall, dull, heavy and not quick moving, it &s;ignifies not only defect as to the un|comeline&s;s; but al&s;o a di&s;tempered and imperfect Hor&s;e, of an evil breed. If his eyes be Red, Fiery, take heed of Moon-eyes, which are not much di&s;tant from blindne&s;s, if for the greate&s;t part White or Wall-ey'd, then it &s;ignifies weakne&s;s in the Hor&s;e, a weak &s;ight, and &s;ubject to &s;tart at every object that &s;wiftly is pre&s;ented to his view. If you perceive white &s;pecks in the eyes, then it denoteth that he is in danger of having the Pin and Web, Pearl or the like infirmity, tending to blindne&s;s; if watery and bloody, then &s;ubject to hot Rheumes: if mattery, it is occa&s;ioned through exce&s;&s;ive riding, &s;urfeit, fe&s;tered Rheumes or &s;trains. If his eyes appear dead, dull
<PB N="97" REF="62"> or hollow, &s;unk as it were in his head, then is he inclining to blindne&s;s, and will not long continue his perfect &s;ight; or is got|ten by an old Stallion on an old Mare. If his eyes are mo&s;t white, and the black but &s;mall, &s;o that the white appears much in &s;ight as the balls move, it denotes weakne&s;s and an evil temper.</P>
<P>Fifthly, Ob&s;erve his Chaps or Cheeks, and if you perceive the bones thin, lean, and between them a wide &s;pace. The Throple or wind-pipe big, no knots nor kernels near it, and the Jaws &s;o great that the neck lyes as it were between them, it denotes the Hor&s;e to be &s;ound and to have a good and long wind, as likewi&s;e to be of great courage; but on the contrary, if his Chaps or Cheeks be &s;eeming fat or thick, the &s;pace between them clo&s;ed with tu|mid fle&s;h; and the Wind-pipe &s;mall or in|cumbred with kernels, then is the Hor&s;e &s;hort-winded, &s;ubject to the Strangles Glaunders, and divers other di&s;tempers. If his Jaws be &s;trait, in&s;omuch that his neck bears over, or &s;wells above them, unle&s;s by &s;ome di&s;temper occa&s;ioned, then it &s;ig|nifies foulne&s;s, pur&s;ine&s;s, and that the Hor&s;e is &s;ubject to colds and &s;urfeits. If the &s;welling be long, clo&s;e, and feel hard, then will he be &s;ubject to the Winds or impo|&s;tume.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="63">
<P>Sixthly, Ob&s;erve his No&s;trils, the which if they prove wide, large, open and dry, &s;o that upon any &s;norting or &s;training of the Hor&s;e, the inward redne&s;s appears, his Muzzel &s;mall, and he deep mouthed, his lips equally meeting; then is he a Hor&s;e of good wind, good mettal, and of a &s;ound con&s;titution: but if the contrary, then is he &s;ubject to divers di&s;tempers, and will ne|ver prove a good Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Ob&s;erve his brea&s;t, the which if it be broad, &s;welling out hard, well boned, and the like, it denoteth &s;trength, comeli|ne&s;s and continuance: but on the contrary, if it be narrow or bending inwards, it de|noteth the Hor&s;e to be apt to &s;tumble, of a weak &s;pirit, and altogether unfit for the performance of any great labour; as like|wi&s;e much deformity.</P>
<P>Eighthly, Ob&s;erve from his Elbow to his Knee, that his thighs be well brawned, clean and &s;olidly fle&s;hed: for if &s;trong Li|gaments are wanting, and the fle&s;h feel &s;oft and &s;pungy, then it denotes weakne&s;s in your Hor&s;e, as the other doth &s;trength.</P>
<P>Ninthly, Take e&s;pecial notice of his knees, that they are of due proportion, not one higher than the other, well joyn|ted, &s;inewed and &s;trongly knit, lean, even, which betokens &s;trength and comeline&s;s;
<PB N="99" REF="63"> when on the other hand, if they be Gro&s;s, Gouty, Scared, want Hair in &s;ome places, it denotes weakne&s;s, &s;tumbling and a di&s;|proportioned Jade.</P>
<P>Tenthly, Ob&s;erve his legs; if they ap|pear, upon handling, lean, rather flat than round, full of &s;inews, bending inward, without &s;eams or hair broken: It denotes a &s;ound &s;ub&s;tantial Hor&s;e, and one that will indure much labour. When marks, on the contrary, as fle&s;hy legs di&s;torted, bending outward or the like, denote a weak un&s;erviceable and tyring Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>What has been before &s;poken of, being narrowly ob&s;erved by the Buyer, let him al&s;o take particular notice of what as yet remains untouch'd; which in their order, for his better in&s;tructions, I &s;hall &s;et down.</P>

The fir&s;t of which being clear and well knit together, and the la&s;t &s;hort, &s;trong and upright, denotes a good firm and &s;ub|&s;tantial tread, but if the former appear big or puffy, &s;eeming &s;omewhat &s;welled, then is the Hor&s;e &s;ubject to &s;inew Strains and

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the Hoof.</HEAD>
<P>THe be&s;t Hoof is the black &s;mooth and tough Hoof, rather inclining to long, than round and well hollowed, &s;ubject much to &s;ounding. As for the white Hoof it is ten|der, and will not well bear a &s;hoo. The Hoof that is rugged and full of &s;eams or wrinkles, denotes Old-Age in the Hor&s;e that he came of an old decayed &s;tock, or has been addicted to over-heats. As for the brittle Hoof it is wor&s;t of all, for it will carry no &s;hoo. If the Hoof be more than ordinary round, the Hor&s;e will be apt to trip and &s;tumble, e&s;pecially in deep ways; or if he be but put to an extraordinary mo|tion. If the Hoof be flat and Pumiced, it denotes foundering. The Hoof that is hollow and empty, betokens the inward de|cay, by rea&s;on of &s;ome founder brui&s;e, or wound not throughly &s;earched or cured. Take likewi&s;e notice of the Crown of the Hoof, and if you perceive the fle&s;h flat, and the hair &s;mooth, then is all in good order in that part; but if the Hair be rough, ri&s;ing, the
<PB N="101" REF="64"> fle&s;h &s;welling, full of knops or &s;cabs, &s;cared or broken, then it denotes a Ring bone, Quitter-bone, or Crown-&s;cab.</P>

<P>HAving viewed your Hor&s;e narrowly before, come to his right-&s;ide, and there take e&s;pecial notice that his head be placed neither too high nor too low, but that it &s;tand as it were in a direct line, evenly carryed, and for his Neck, let it be &s;mall at the &s;etting on of the head, long, and &s;till growing deeper, as it de&s;cends towards the &s;hould|ers, with a high &s;trong and thin Main, long, &s;oft, and indifferently well curling, which denotes the Hor&s;e not only of a good breed, but are greatly ornamental; for if the Head be ill &s;et on, though in it &s;elf it be well &s;haped, 'tis a great blemi&s;h to the beauty of the Hor&s;e. If you per|ceive any ri&s;ing or &s;welling in the nape of the neck, it is a &s;ymptom of the Pole-evil or a fi&s;tula. If your Hor&s;e have a &s;hort thick neck, or if it be fat and falling at the Withers; if the Cre&s;t be low, thick, falling, and weak, they are tokens of dullne&s;s in the Hor&s;e; as al&s;o does an extraordinary thick Maine: little hair on the Maine, denotes fury, but
<PB N="102" REF="65"> if it fall off, then is it occa&s;ioned by the di&s;temper called the Worm in the Maine; the Itch or Mangine&s;s, which there are breeding, though perhaps not apparent by any other &s;ymptoms.</P>

As for his Belly, let it fall down indifferently well, de&s;cend|ing as it were by degrees, from his loyns to his foreparts; and his Stones carried even, and not hanging down, or &s;wagging. All the&s;e denote perfection in a Hor&s;e; but if the Chine be narrow, he is nought for the Saddle, and if put to it, very much &s;ubject to gauling; to be Saddle-backed, Sway-backed, or have the back bending, denotes weakne&s;s. Flat Ribs betoken hide-boundne&s;s. Hanging long or weak Fillets, denote him not capable of clambering, or journeying in hilly Countries, nor of carrying
<PB N="103" REF="65"> a burthen. If his belly be clung, or over gaunt, his Stones uneven or dangling, they are &s;ymptoms of &s;ickne&s;s, foundering or dullne&s;s, and unaptne&s;s to labour.</P>

<P>If the Thighs or Gaskings be even, and let down well, to the middle joynt, full of &s;inews, thick and brawny, they are &s;igns of Beauty and &s;trength, but if they appear Slender or Lank, it de|notes deformity, and weakne&s;s in your Hor&s;e.</P>

If you perceive any &s;cabs above the Pa&s;terns, then it denoteth him to have the &s;cratches, or if a chop appear there, then is he affli|cted with the Rheumes.</P>
<P>As for the &s;etting on the Tail, it is worthy only of this ob&s;ervation, that where there is a good Buttock, the Tail cannot be evil|ly &s;et on; and where there is a bad Buttock, it cannot &s;tand right: A Tail well &s;et on ought to &s;tand broad, high, and flat, couch|ing &s;omewhat inwards.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations nece&s;&s;ary to be made on the Cambrels of your Hor&s;e, are the&s;e; fir&s;t, ob&s;erve well the middle joynt behind, and if there you perceive it repleni&s;hed with firm &s;mooth skin-bones and &s;inews, a little bending, then is that part of the Hor&s;e &s;ound and beautiful. Secondly, If in making a narrow in&s;pection, you do per|ceive
<PB N="105" REF="66"> Sores, Chaps, inward bought or bending, then it denotes the Hor&s;e to be troubled with a Sellander: but if all o|ver the joynt, you perceive it tumid or &s;welled, it is a &s;ign he has received &s;ome blow or brui&s;e; yet if it be a particular &s;welling in the hollow part, Pit, or proud &amp; full on the in&s;ide of the vein; and the &s;wel|ling be &s;oft, then is it a Blood Spavin; or if hard, a bone Spavin: but if it appear be|hind, before the Knuckle, then conclude it to be a Curb. And thus far having &s;up|plyed the Buyer with infallible directions to prevent all frauds, if they be narrowly ob|&s;erved, I &s;hall proceed to lay down infallible Rules, whereby a Hor&s;es age may be known.</P>

Now
<PB N="106" REF="67"> the ob&s;ervations whereby to know the Hor&s;es age, are the&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t year his Foals or Colts teeth called Grinders or Gatherers only appear, and the&s;e are &s;mall white and &s;mooth.</P>
<P>The &s;econd year he changeth two of his fore teeth, one above, and the other beneath, each in the middle of the Rows, of the Gatherers, which come up browner and larger than the other.</P>
<P>The year following, he changeth the next to tho&s;e afore&s;aid, leaving no direct Colts-teeth before, unle&s;s on either &s;ide two above, and two below, which are &s;mall and bright.</P>
<P>The fourth year no Foals teeth, except one on either &s;ide are left him, he chang|ing what otherwi&s;e remained.</P>
<P>The fifth year he changeth all his fore|mo&s;t teeth, having his Tu&s;hes compleat, and tho&s;e that come up in the place of the la&s;t Foals teeth he ca&s;teth, will be hollow with &s;mall black &s;pecks in the mid&s;t of them, by the continuance of which the Hor&s;es age is to be known to the eighth year.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth year his new Tu&s;hes put forth, at the bottom of which young fle&s;h will appear, the Tu&s;hes &s;mall, white, &s;harp and &s;hort.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="67">
<P>The Seventh year his teeth will be all of perfect growth, and the Mark in the mouth more vi&s;ible than ever.</P>
<P>On the Eighth year all his teeth will be plain, &s;mooth, full and in their perfect &s;hape, at what time the black &s;pecks will dimini&s;h, being not after the expiration of that year to be perceived, the Tu&s;hes will likewi&s;e change colour, becoming more yellow.</P>
<P>The Ninth year, the Mark being vani&s;h|ed, the fore teeth will be longer and broad|er than u&s;ual, and change their colour to a yellowi&s;h palene&s;s, his Tu&s;hes lo&s;ing much of their &s;harpne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Tenth year, the holes in the in&s;ide of his upper Tu&s;hes will be filled up, which till that time you may with your finger feel like hollow pits, and the Temples of the head appear crooked, and begin to hol|low.</P>
<P>The Eleventh year will produce his teeth of a great length, yellow, foul and di&s;torted.</P>
<P>The Twelfth and la&s;t year to know a Hor|&s;es age by his teeth, you will ob&s;erve them long, exceeding yellow, and that the up|per teeth will hang over the under ones, and though &s;ome are of opinion that his age to the thirteenth year is to be known, by the wearing of his Tu&s;hes clo&s;e to his chaps,

Another thing in the mouth worthy of ob|&s;ervation, is to ob&s;erve whether he be not too deep burnt of the Lampus, and that the bars and fle&s;h lie even and &s;mooth; for if the hole be too deep burnt, Hay and Provender will &s;tick therein, to his great hindrance in feeding.</P>

<PB N="111" REF="69"> now proceed to the office of the skillful Farrier.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Of the Office of the Farrier, and what is chiefly therein to be con&s;idered.</HEAD>
<P>HE that will be accounted an experien|ced able Farrier, mu&s;t not only be skilled in &s;hooing, and dre&s;&s;ing, but in all the parts of a Hor&s;es body, thereby to know from whence proceeds the original cau&s;e of any di&s;temper, how and by what means it was generated, and the more effectually to apply &s;uch remedies as may remove the di&s;temper, and work a perfect cure: to do which, note the&s;e following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the &s;eat of life is in the Brain, Heart and Liver, from whence it operates in, and di&s;po&s;es every member; and for that end, tho&s;e by many are called the three principal members, to which &s;ome would add a fourth, <HI>viz.</HI> the Stones, but that addition by the wi&s;e&s;t practitioners has been rejected.</P>
<P>Secondly, The &s;inews which are the&s;e, two white &s;inews or Tendons, which be|gin at the No&s;e, and pa&s;&s;ing through the neck and back, branch into the forelegs, and end in the hinderlegs, taking their liga|ments in all the four feet. Two &s;inews
<PB N="112" REF="70"> called the Main &s;inews, which de&s;cend from the Brain, and pa&s;&s;ing down the cheeks, fa&s;ten the Jaws. Three, from the Shoul|der to the fir&s;t joynt of the Arms, or fore|legs, be&s;ides two other great &s;inews; four great &s;inews from the knees to the Pa|&s;terns, with the &s;ame number in the hinder part above, as well within as without the forepart of the brea&s;t, are ten &s;inews great and &s;mall. From the Reins of the back to the Stones are four great &s;inews or Liga|ments, and another great &s;inew which runs to the end of the Tail: To conclude, a Hor&s;e has great and &s;mall &s;inews 29. or as &s;ome will have it 30.</P>
<P>Thirdly, As to the Veins in a Hor&s;e, through which the blood circulates the whole body; they are many, yet &s;eeing they all center in the Liver, the &s;eat and fountain of blood, di&s;tributing it into every part: divers are of opinion that a Hor&s;e has properly but one vein, which is called the Median, and that when ever the blood is corrupted, or that vein is afflicted with wind or any infirmity, it di&s;pen&s;ing it through all the branches, afflicts at once the whole body of the Hor&s;e. Tho&s;e branches, that a&s;cend to the head and upper parts of the body, are called a&s;cendants, and tho&s;e that run down into their legs and nether parts of
<PB N="113" REF="70"> the body de&s;cendants, and through the&s;e branches, whether the bea&s;t &s;leep or wake, the blood continues its cour&s;e, as indeed it does in all creatures, who&s;e bulk admit a free pa&s;&s;age, Ebbing and Flowing like the Ocean, by the cour&s;e of the Moon. Now the things herein chiefly to be con&s;idered, are the Branches from whence upon &s;undry occa&s;ions, it is mo&s;t proper to take blood; which indeed are many con&s;i&s;tant to the di|&s;temper: for the branch is to be opened, as it either affects the blood, or is &s;eated in the body of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Veins mo&s;t convenient to be opened, are the&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Neck, in the weeping veins under the Ears, and about the head in &s;ix other places, as in the Pa|late-veins in the Tongue, in the Flank-veins, in the brea&s;t, and Spur-veins, in the four members, <HI>viz.</HI> the Legs, Thighs, Pa|&s;terns and Feet, and indeed in mo&s;t veins, according as the di&s;temper is &s;eated, by bloodletting, being great, as in the follow|ing chapter will appear.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>To what end Phlebotomy, or bloodletting &s;erves.</HEAD>
<P>THe opening the Temple vein ea&s;eth pain in the head, cau&s;ed by cold Rheumes, Feavers, Drow&s;ine&s;s, Stavars,
<PB N="114" REF="71"> yellows, Frenzy, Sleepy-evil, Falling-evil or any grief afflicting the Eyes or Brain. The opening of the Weeping veins, is ex|ceeding good to prevent blindne&s;s, and to cure the di&s;tempers in the eyes, as Water|ings, hot Rheumes, Haws, Pin and Web, Pearls, blood-&s;hotten and the like. The opening the Palate-veins, cures or pervents the Lampa&s;s, or inward &s;ickne&s;s, as Sta|vars, Anticor, Yellows, Drow&s;ine&s;s, Sur|feits, Tirings, and many times cureth the Strangles, Quin&s;ie, Swelling of the kernels, Pu&s;tles, Inflammation, or Glaunders, e&s;pe|cially, if you cau&s;e him to drink the blood mixed with a little Bay-&s;alt. The next veins opened help the Yellows, Farcins, Stavars, Mangies, Agues, Feavours, Surfeits, Scabs, Glaunders and the like; and often prevent &s;ickne&s;s in your Hor&s;e or Mare. The opening the palate, or brea&s;t veins, prevent or help the Anticor, Moore-foundering, occa&s;ioned by molten grea&s;e, contracted in the body by hard riding, it likewi&s;e preventeth di&s;ea&s;es in the Liver, Lungs and other internal parts, is conveni|ent to be done upon any hurt or &s;prain in the Shoulder, to prevent Lamene&s;s. The opening the two thigh veins, helpeth foun|dering in the forefeet, Splint, Screw-ring|bone, Mallender, or the like infirmity.
<PB N="115" REF="71"> To bleed the four Shackle veins before, is good again&s;t the Crown-&s;cab, Quitter-bone and the like di&s;temper incident to the feet of a Hor&s;e or Mare. To bleed the Spur-veins is excellent good for the Moore-founder, Farcine in the &s;ide, &s;welling under the belly or the like. The Toe-veins being opened do help Frettizing, foundering, Hoof-bound or any grief, occa&s;ioned by the Hor&s;es beating his Hoofs upon hard &s;tony way: Bleeding the two thigh-veins behind, ea&s;eth the grief of the kidnies, &s;welling in the hinder legs, Foundering, Scratches, pi&s;&s;ing of Blood, occa&s;ioned by over&s;training, or the weakne&s;s of the Reins, Back or Belly, and infirmity in the Guts; as likewi&s;e the Curb, Spavin, and &s;uch other di&s;tempers or griefs, as proceed from rankne&s;s or impurity of Blood. To open the Shackle veins behind, is exceeding good to prevent foundering, or any pain the Hor&s;e is &s;ubject to have in his feet. To open the Flank-veins, is exceeding good in ca&s;e of a Feavour, Swelling in the Stones, Poverty, or the Felt-worm. And la&s;tly, to bleed the Tail-vein often, prevents the Mange, Scabs, Itch, and falling off of the Hair. So that the number of veins that are u&s;u|ally opened upon divers occa&s;ions are Thirty: the opening of which greatly con|tribute
<PB N="116" REF="72"> to the health of the Hor&s;e or Mare, not only by preventing di&s;tempers, as has been before &s;aid, but frequently without any other application, by taking away the effects, cau&s;e the grief to cea&s;e, or at lea&s;t pre|pare the body of the Hor&s;e, the better to receive &s;uch effectual medicines as will work his cure, and di&s;po&s;e outward wounds, brui&s;es and the like, to &s;uch a temper that they heal without much difficulty.</P>

Choler, by rea&s;on of its heat, being alluded to Fire; Blood, by rea&s;on of its heat and moi&s;ture to Air; Phlegm, by rea&s;on of its coldne&s;s and moi|&s;ture to Water; and Melancholy, by rea|&s;on of its cold and dryne&s;s, to Earth: as for Choler, its &s;eat is in and near the Liver, which by rea&s;on of its heat and dryne&s;s accords with the blood, which has its foun|tain in the Liver, and from thence di&s;per|&s;es it &s;elf throughout the whole body, nouri&s;hing and pre&s;erving it in all parts:

<P>TO know the better to prepare your Medicines, nece&s;&s;ary to be given up|on &s;undry occa&s;ions; it is fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ary that you know which of the four afore&s;aid hu|mours is mo&s;t predominant in your Hor&s;e, which cannot better be di&s;cerned than by his Colour or complexion: note then if he be cole-black without any white, a bright Sor|rel or an Iron-gray unchangeable, that will neither turn to a Flea-bitten, White, or Da|ple gray, then is he mo&s;t &s;ubject to Choler,
<PB N="120" REF="74"> by rea&s;on of the great heat in him, often incident to inflammation of the Liver, Yel|lows and Pe&s;tilential Feavours; and in that ca&s;e you mu&s;t, to prevent the&s;e di&s;tempers, give him medicines to purge Choler, but let them not be of a quality too much ope|rating, le&s;t they impair his &s;trength to that degree, that he never after recover it: for all cholerick Hor&s;es, though they be fierce and fiery, are but of &s;mall &s;trength. If your Hor&s;e be coloured either Bright-bay, or Dark-bay, neither &s;couling counte|nance, maughy mouthed, or white flanked, or a white Fleabitten, white Lyard, like &s;il|ver, or black with a white Star, white Ra&s;h, or white foot, then is he Sanguin; and the di&s;ea&s;es to which he is mo&s;t &s;ubject, are the Glaunders, Con&s;umption of the Liver, Lepro&s;ie or &s;uch other di&s;tempers as are cau&s;ed by infection. As for the Hor&s;es of a Snguin complection, they are for the mo&s;t part of a &s;trong con&s;titution, and will in|dure &s;trong medicines, without impairing their &s;trength, if the medicines be not com|pounded of extraordinary hot ingredients, to over-heat the blood.</P>
<P>If your Hor&s;es colour be Milk-white, Py-bald, Yellow, Dun, Kite-colour, or any the like colours, in mixture, then is he Phlegmatick, being &s;low by nature, and apt

<P>If your Hor&s;e be of a Dark-bay colour, having long white hairs like Goats hairs on his legs, Ru&s;&s;et, Che&s;nut, A&s;h-colour|ed, Gray or Mou&s;e-dun, then does Melan|choly abound in him, and the di&s;tempers he is mo&s;t &s;ubject to, are the inflammation of the Spleen, Drop&s;ie, Frenzy, and &s;uch like dull and Melancholy di&s;tempers; and therefore require cold and moi&s;t medicines, tho&s;e of a dry or hot quality being altoge|ther hurtful and unprofitable. Their &s;trength is greater than it appears to be, and for the mo&s;t part they are fit for &s;ervile labours, and thus much of the four Elementary humours: now there are di|vers Hor&s;es mixed with all the afore&s;aid colours, or &s;ome three or four of them; in &s;uch a ca&s;e, note that tho&s;e Hor&s;es have tho&s;e humours mo&s;t predominant, of which their colour is mo&s;tly, according to what has been &s;aid, and &s;o con&s;equently ought the medicines to be prepared with regard

<P>THe main cau&s;e of mo&s;t Internal di|&s;tempers in Hor&s;es proceeds either from over violent heats in exerci&s;e, as when the Hor&s;e hath his grea&s;e molten, or the heart over charged with vitiated blood, &s;o that the Pores or pa&s;&s;ages are &s;o &s;topped, that the Vital &s;pirits di&s;|per&s;ed throughout the body, cannot re|turn turn to their center, nor the heart be

<P>Another cau&s;e there is, which proceedeth from cold occa&s;ioned through the negli|gence of the keeper, in not regarding him before and after a journey or exerci&s;e, as he ought; which once taken, troubles his head with pains and dullne&s;s, making him look heavy and dull eyed; the root of the Tongue being often inflamed and &s;wel|led. The Lungs tickled, and offended with Rheums, cau&s;ing &s;trong and tedious Coughs, which greatly indi&s;po&s;e and offend him, whiles noi&s;ome filth proceeds from his no&s;trils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>A third cau&s;e there is cometh by un|&s;ea&s;onable eating or over eating, which frequently begets a &s;urfeit, e&s;pecially if he eat unwhol&s;ome food. If he eat to exce&s;s, it many times proves mortal, by rea&s;on it creates unwhole&s;ome vapours, noi&s;ome fumes and the like, which a&s;cending from the &s;tomach to the brain, poy&s;on and infect it, or if the Hor&s;e e&s;cape with life, yet &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es to have Stavers, or Frenzy: if the food he has eaten be unwhol&s;ome, raw or out of &s;ea&s;on, then it breeds di&s;ea&s;es by producing

<P>HAving laid down the original cau&s;es of mo&s;t mortal &s;ickne&s;&s;es, I &s;hall now proceed to let you under&s;tand how they may be known by the &s;undry &s;ymp|toms that forerun, or attend them according to the opinion of the mo&s;t expert pra|ctitioners in this Art. If the &s;ickne&s;s be
<PB N="126" REF="77"> occa&s;ioned through immoderate heats or journeying, then it is &s;ignified by the heavy|ne&s;s of his countenance, &s;welling of his legs and other limbs, but his hinder legs e&s;pecially by the loo&s;ne&s;s and &s;couring of his body, at the beginning of the &s;ickne&s;s, &s;hort and hot breath, and a loathing or for|&s;aking his meat. If the &s;ickne&s;s proceeds from cold, then it is known by a down|ca&s;t Countenance, Drow&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;ire of &s;leep; Pu&s;tils or hard knots under the Caul; and many times by the in|flammations of the Kernels, and &s;wellings as high as the roots of the Ears, attended by a moi&s;t and inward &s;ounding cough, and the like.</P>
<P>If the &s;ickne&s;s be occa&s;ioned by a &s;urfeit taken after the manner afore&s;aid, then the &s;igns or &s;ymptoms are violent pains in the head, &s;o that he will not by rea&s;on of the dullne&s;s it occa&s;ions, be able to hold it up to the Rack: His Eyes will like|wi&s;e appear dull and &s;unk in his Head, his Ears pricked up, and the tops of them cold; as al&s;o his upperlip and &s;heath; Reeling and Staggering as he goes, the which if it be delayed will turn to Mad|ne&s;s, and that Madne&s;s be known by his eager biting the Manger, or Rack&s;taves, and often beating his head again&s;t the

<P>Now to prevent any of the&s;e &s;ickne&s;s, if you find him a little di&s;tempered, or any thing inclining to be out of order, let him blood, and for three mornings &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly give him a Diapente-drink, and keep|ing him warm, let him fa&s;t for three hours after, then give him a Ma&s;h of Beans, Bran and Oats, and a little knop of Hay, but if it &s;o happen that you are unprovided with Diapente, which no Farrier ought to be, then take a handful of Celendine, wa&s;h it well, roots and leaves, adding to it Wormwoord and Rue, half a handful of

<P>IT is to be ob&s;erved that you ought to take a due proportion of blood from the Hor&s;e, according to his age, &s;trength, or the quality of the di&s;temper.

The cau&s;es for which Hor&s;es ought to bleed, are either to pre&s;erve health by dimini&s;h|ing the &s;uperfluity of blood, that burns or heats the veins; to divert &s;ickne&s;s, or chear the vital &s;pirits, by giving the blood a free and uncontrouled pa&s;&s;age, after which you mu&s;t moderately chafe or walk him, to make the blood fill tho&s;e veins or branches that were emptied, and to make him bleed the freer; &s;uffer him to drink warm water be|fore you open the Vein.</P>
<P>If he bleed not freely, it is a &s;ign that he is pur&s;ie, fat, or the blood &s;tagnated, then to oblige him thereto put your finger in his mouth, tickle him, and cau&s;e him to move his Jaws, thereby to pre&s;s the vein to a more facil evacuation, and having bled &s;ufficiently, take part of the blood mingled with &s;alt, and pour it down his throat, with a Drenching-horn, and with the other part bathe his body whil&s;t it is warm, which is excellent in a con&s;umption, moi&s;t cough, or weakne&s;s of the Limbs.</P>

<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on outward &s;orrances, a de&s;cripti|on of them, and how they are to be or|dered.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e grievances called Sorrances have in their particulars divers names, ac|cording to their being placed in the body, but in general are taken two manner of
<PB N="143" REF="85"> ways, <HI>viz.</HI> either an evil &s;tate and compo|&s;ition of the body, which is to be di&s;cerned by the number, quality or &s;ight of the members evilly affected, di&s;ea&s;ed, or other|wi&s;e it is a loo&s;ening or divi&s;ion of any uni|ty, the which is thus in general divided, and chancing diver&s;ly, have divers particular names, according as is afore&s;aid, to the parts of the body, in which they happen: for if &s;uch a loo&s;ning or divi&s;ion happen in the bone, then it is properly termed a Fracture, if in the fle&s;hy part a wound or Ulcer: in the Veins, if it happen, then 'tis called a Rupture: If in the &s;inews, the Cramp or Convul&s;ion: if in the skin, excoriation. Now the things chiefly to be ob&s;erved in curing Sorrances are the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Ob&s;erve that in burning or caute|rizing with a hot Iron or with Oyle, or making an inci&s;ion with a knife, that it be neither upon a vein or &s;inew, but &s;ome|what higher or lower, or on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>Secondly, Ob&s;erve that you never apply to any joynt or &s;inewey part violent cor|ro&s;ives, as Re&s;algar, Ar&s;nick, &s;ublimate Mercury, Oyl of Vitriol or the like.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That in cauterizing you rather lance with a hot Iron than with a cold, and that 'tis better to cauterize than to cut.</P>
<PB N="144" REF="86">
<P>Fourthly, ob&s;erve if the Hor&s;e be San|guin, his blood produceth a white thick matter, but if Colerick, a wateri&s;h &s;alt and thin matter, though in quantity &s;mall. If Phlegmatick, great &s;tore of watery gelly, as it were; but if Melanchly, dry Scabs only.</P>
<P>Fifthly, ob&s;erve as I have before hinted, never to bleed your Hor&s;e but upon the days pre&s;cribed, and not then for fan&s;ie &s;ake, but in ca&s;e of &s;ome di&s;temper that requires it, or to prevent a &s;ickne&s;s imminent by rea&s;on of bad or boiling blood, which afflicts the Veins.</P>
<P>Sixthly, Ob&s;erve in all Impo&s;thumes or &s;welling Sores, called Tumors, diligently to note the place where the grief began its increa&s;e, &s;tate and dangerous con&s;equence, as likewi&s;e its declination and ending.</P>
<P>Seventhly, Take notice, that if in the beginning of every &s;welling Impo&s;thume, you cannot eradicate it, u&s;e Repercu&s;|&s;ive medicines; if it be not too near the vi|tals or &s;ome other principal part of the body; if it be, you mu&s;t forbear the u&s;e of &s;uch Medicines or applications, le&s;t thereby you indanger the Hor&s;es life, but rather u&s;e &s;oftening and &s;uppling medicines, till &s;uch time as the Impo&s;thume, Tumor or &s;wel|ling be ripe, and then with a Lancet let out
<PB N="145" REF="86"> the corruption, and by degrees dry it up with clean&s;ing and healing medicines.</P>
<P>Eighthly, All &s;oft or hard &s;wellings ought to have different applications according to the part of the body where they happen, or the cau&s;e from which they proceed; as for hard &s;wellings, they are for the mo&s;t part corro&s;ive, and the &s;oft unle&s;s well regarded, of long continuance. Now to know whether a &s;welling has been of long &s;tanding, e&s;pecially in the legs, pre&s;s it with your finger, and &s;uddainly taking it away, if you perceive the fle&s;h immediately to fill the dint, then the &s;welling is newly taken, but if it &s;tand hollow, then is the &s;welling of a long &s;tanding, proceeding from &s;ome old hurt, and will not be removed without difficulty.</P>
<P>Ninthly, If Sores matter moderately, then it denotes they cure a pace; but if the putrefaction increa&s;e more and more, it of|ten times denotes inward rottenne&s;s.</P>
<P>Tenthly, Ob&s;erve that Cauterizing with hot Irons, always &s;traineth things inlarged, di&s;&s;olveth gatherings or hardne&s;s; dryeth up mo&s;ture, draweth to one place di&s;per&s;ed humours, and helpeth old griefs, by cau&s;ing them to ripen &s;peedily, and avoid the matte|ry humour they contain; in cauterizing take notice al&s;o that you burn &s;ometimes
<PB N="146" REF="87"> under the &s;ore to divert the humour, and &s;ometimes above to defend and keep back the humour: as for burning, it is done two ways, the one called Actual, and the other Potential. The former being done with hot Irons, and the latter with hot Oyles, Waters, and other Cau&s;ticks, and Corro|&s;ives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Hoofs, how many &s;orts there are, their perfe|ctions and imperfections.</HEAD>
<P>OF Hoofs, there are divers kinds, &s;ome perfect, and others imperfect: The imperfect Hoof, is when any part is lack|ing; or if it be un&s;eemly, &s;preading broad,

To &s;hoo which, not being as yet grown to too flat, the Farrier with his paring Iron mu&s;t take off as much of the Toe and &s;ides as it is po&s;&s;ible, &s;till keeping it round, but let him not touch the quarter or the heel, unle&s;s it be to make the &s;eat of the &s;hoo plain, and let that be as lightly as may be, &s;till anointing the Hoofs with Hogs-grea&s;e and Oyl of Baies, and within a while they will become round thick and fea&s;able: The &s;hoo wherewith this Hoof mu&s;t be brought to perfection, mu&s;t be made &s;trong, with a broad webb, and broad Spunges, pierced from the quarters to the hard Toe, but not to the Heel, the holes wider without than within, and the foot diligently pared as afore&s;aid, from the Tallon nail towards the heel, &s;uffer the &s;hoo to &s;tand a &s;traws breadth with|out the Hoof; the better to &s;ave the Coffin, let your nails be made of good Iron, the

<HEAD>The perfect Hoof on the forefeet, how to pare, &s;hooe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IF the Hoof be perfect, fir&s;t pare the &s;eat of the Shooe as even and plain as may be, that the &s;hooe &s;itting clo&s;e may bear no more on the one &s;ide than on the other, nor take more on the Toe than the Heel; for the Heels mu&s;t be higher than the Toes, but by rea&s;on all the weight of the Hor&s;es fore part pre&s;&s;es up|on the quarters, and heels of the fore feet, tho&s;e parts mu&s;t be mo&s;t regarded, and as little of the Buttere&s;&s;es taken off as may be; for the heels are naturally weaker than the toes: but this is meant by the fore-feet only, for the paring of the hinder-feet is quite contrary, as will hereafter ap|pear.</P>
<P>For the mo&s;t exact method of &s;hooing the perfect Hoof, ob&s;erve the&s;e following rules, <HI>viz.</HI> Let your &s;hooe be of Spani&s;h Iron, or other well tempered Iron, the

<HEAD>Of the Brittle and Rugged Hoof, Long Hooof, Crooked Hoof, Flat Hoof, Broad Fru&s;hes and narrow Heels, what they are, and how to be u&s;ed.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THe rough and brittle is rugged and full of crinkles or &s;eams like a Rams Horn, cau&s;ed by the intemperature of the foot, either too hot or dry, to remedy which bind it about with Hogs-grea&s;e, Mar&s;hmallows and Oyl of Earth|worms, &s;till chafing the legs to di&s;per&s;e the hot humours, and in &s;o doing, in a weeks time the hoof will be greatly &s;of|tened, at what time with a Ra&s;p file off the ruggedne&s;s as well as you can, but come not too near the quick; then ha|ving a &s;hooe in readine&s;s, neither too heavy nor too light, &s;et it on with nine nails, five without and four within, &s;top his feet with Cow-dung, fryed in Hogs-grea&s;e, and let him run in moi&s;t ground.</P>
<PB N="271" REF="149">
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The long hoof is that which cau&s;es the Hor&s;e for the mo&s;t part to tread upon his heel, going as it were on his Pa&s;terns, which occa&s;ions Windgalls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To help which, pare away the toe and the buttre&s;&s;es an&s;werable; anointing it with hot butter, till you have brought it to the fa&s;hion of a perfect hoof; then having a &s;hooe round at the toe as may be, and if the foot be narrow, let the &s;hooe appear a &s;traws breadth without the hoof, and pierce the &s;hooe the deeper, &s;et it more backward than to other Hor&s;es is u&s;ual, becau&s;e Hor&s;es having &s;uch feet, do tread more backward than others, fix it on with eight nails, and &s;uffer not the hoof afterwards to grow long.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The crooked hoof is when the hoof is broad without and narrow within, rendring the Hor&s;e &s;play-footed, by tread|ing inwardly, &s;ubjecting him to interfe|ring, and often lamene&s;s: in paring this hoof, ob&s;erve which &s;ide is highe&s;t, and then levelling it, pare the re&s;t like the perfect hoof; let the &s;hooe in this ca&s;e be &s;trong, with a broad web, fitted to the foot, by paring, &s;etting the &s;trong|e&s;t part of the &s;hooe to the weake&s;t part of the hoof, and fa&s;ten it on with
<PB N="272" REF="150"> nine nails, five without and four within.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The flat hoof is much of the nature of the imperfect hoof: in paring this hoof you mu&s;t take away the toe, till you can make the &s;hooe &s;it compleat, as al&s;o the &s;ides, the heel and ball touch not, but let them remain as &s;trong as po&s;|&s;ible: Then having a &s;hooe with a broad Web, for the more it covers the weak &s;ole, the more commodious it is, permit|ting the Middle part of the web that covers the Ball of the Foot to be much thicker than the other; where the piercings are, and &s;o hollow that it touch no part of the Ball of the Foot, large enough in eve|ry part, &s;o that he may go ea&s;ily, pier|cing it round the toe, to favour the heels, and fa&s;tened on with five nails on a &s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Broad Fru&s;hes are when the Fru&s;hes are broad, the heels weak and &s;oft, that they may be in a manner bent together, which makes him tread ginger|ly or painfully on &s;tony or hard ground: in paring this hoof you mu&s;t be very cautious, paring only the toe and a little the &s;eat of the &s;hooe, le&s;t you lame your Hor&s;e: The &s;hooe mu&s;t be &s;tronger to|ward the heel than the toe, and the Web in that part broade&s;t: &s;et on this &s;hooe with
<PB N="273" REF="150"> nine nails, and in all other re&s;pects u&s;e it as the perfect hoof.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Narrow heels are frequently tender and of no long indurance, in which ca&s;e you mu&s;t pare the toe &s;hort, making the &s;eat of the &s;hooe fair and plain, and open only, that there may be a little &s;pace between the Fru&s;h and the heel: for the better it is, the le&s;s you take off the heel: The &s;hooe for this purpo&s;e mu&s;t be light, the Web broad, and the Sponges almo&s;t meet: let the piercing be all to|wards the toe, &s;paring the heel &s;o much as you can, &s;uffering it to be long e|nough that way, and fa&s;ten it with eight nails. If the hoof be over hollow, yet firm, pare it round about the edges, e&s;|pecially the &s;eat of the &s;hooe, to the intent the hollowne&s;s within may not be &s;o deep, always keep it moi&s;t with &s;topping it, for fear of hoof-binding; and let the &s;hooe be in all points the &s;ame with that directed for the perfect hoof.

Then having beaten the blow|en place with a Hazle wand, let it go, and thru&s;ting in your Roweling needle, which mu&s;t be &s;even or eight inches long, let it come out above the place grieved, draw|ing after it Hair or Sar&s;net to the thickne&s;s of a mans finger, annointed with butter or Hogs-lard, &s;tir it about, and every day dre&s;s it with Lard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The which will cau&s;e the corruption, though contracted deep in the fle&s;h or in the joynts, to come away; but ob&s;erve that you Rowel the &s;ame way the veins run, and not cro&s;s, for fear of laming your Hor&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The Jockies device to cheat the Buyer, with a blind or lame Hor&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>IF the Hor&s;e be blind through age or ac|cident, or with exce&s;&s;ive riding, and his &s;ight irrecoverably lo&s;t, though no Pin, Web, Haw, Film, or the like be apparent, but the defect is in the very center of the Eye, by the defect of nerves, in&s;en&s;ibly that con|vey the &s;peculative &s;ight to the twinkles. Then the Jocky having dre&s;&s;ed him up to the be&s;t advantage, keeps him two or three days at high feeding, and &s;till as he comes
<PB N="280" REF="154"> to dre&s;s &s;trikes, him over the face and eyes with his whip or wand, till the Hor&s;e with the lea&s;t &s;uddain noi&s;e, fearing the coming of the whip or &s;witch, to&s;&s;es up his head, and winks, as if he fore&s;aw it, which deceives the buyer, in &s;uppo&s;ing he does &s;o. Another way the Jockey has in often blowing ground Pepper, Ginger, Salt or Allum into the Hor&s;es eyes, which makes him always &s;o fearful of being tormented in that nature, that when the Jockey has brought him to Market, and his eyes are que&s;tioned, he pre&s;ently &s;wears they are perfect (being &s;eldom without a Budget full of new minted Oaths) and thereupon tells the Buyer that with the lea&s;t motion of his hand the Hor&s;e &s;hall &s;tart, mount his head, or &s;hut his eyes; which proves &s;o by this means, the Jockey has always in his pocket &s;mall &s;hot le&s;s than pins heads, Rape&s;eed or the like, a few of which he unperceived of the Buyer, holds between his finger and thumb, and upon the motion of his hand fillips them into the Hor&s;es face or eyes, who upon the lea&s;t feeling, &s;uppo&s;ing that he is about to be tormented, throws up his head, winks or &s;tarts: nay, he &s;o orders it by buffeting him with his hat often

Another trick he has by touching the Hor&s;e on the knees, or under the belly, to make him mount his head, which he brings him to by former check|ing of a rigid curb bridle, fa&s;tned to tho&s;e places; if you ask him to ride the Hor&s;e, unle&s;s it be in a plain field or even Road, he will tell you he would not have you put your &s;elf to that trouble, but he'l call &s;ome poor boy or other, and give him a peny to do it, that &s;o he may the bet|er ob&s;erve his going: then has he &s;aun|tering up and down, or &s;tanding aloof, an arch Rogue of his own, acquainted with all the infirmities of the Hor&s;e, whom he calls, as if he had never before &s;een him, and he manages the Hor&s;e to the &s;atisfaction of the Jockey and Buyer: If there be any vi&s;ible ob&s;tructi|on of &s;ight, and the Jockey cannot re|move it, then having blowed powder of Tartar into his Eye or Eyes, which will for five or &s;ix hours after cau&s;e him to wink, that the Blemi&s;h cannot be ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, he chu&s;es to ex|po&s;e
