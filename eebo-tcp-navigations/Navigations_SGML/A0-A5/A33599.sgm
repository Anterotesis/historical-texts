<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Combinations and Endea|vours of the States General of the United Provinces again&s;t His Maje&s;ty, and this Nation have been &s;o in&s;upportably In&s;olent, that the Parliament not long &s;ince, upon the Cry of the Whole Nation, did &s;ol|licite him to take &s;ome extraordinary way to give Redre&s;s unto his Subjects for the many and daily Injuries they &s;u&s;tained from them by their Depredations at Sea, for the Horrid and Barbarous Cruelties inflicted on them in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which being as
<PB REF="3"> odious in their Nature, as they are remar|kable in their Number, have been the onely Cau&s;e that the&s;e pains are taken to give a ge|neral &s;atisfaction to the World, by exhibiting this Brief, but mo&s;t true Account of His Ma|je&s;ties Undoubted Right, and &s;ole Propriety in the <HI>Engli&s;h, Scotti&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h Seas:</HI> A truth as Antient, as it is Eminent, and not only held forth and atte&s;ted by the Laws of our Land, and the Records of the Tower, and the High Courts of Parliament, but heretofore confe&s;&s;ed al&s;o by divers of their own Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, as in this Book you &s;hall find it faithfully repre&s;ented to you; But it hath been the late practi&s;e of the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> (without examining the Lawfulne&s;s of the Act) to put their Oares into every Boat, where Gain and Profit doth appear. It was this, that tempted them to invade the I&s;lands of <HI>Moluccos, Lantore,</HI> and <HI>Polleroon,</HI> which in the Name of the Crown of <HI>England</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for &s;ome years had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, neither did they entertain the lea&s;t jealou&s;ie of oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who they knew heretofore had been oblidged to them for many antient good Offices in a time, when their greate&s;t &s;afety did depend upon them, and who lately were conjoyned with them in
<PB REF="3"> a &s;trict Alliance and Confederacy for Part|ner&s;hip in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indie</HI>-Trade, in the year <HI>1619.</HI> Neither did they fear the Natives, whom they found to expre&s;s a greater Incli|nation of good will unto them then to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> aimed at no|thing more, then a lawful and competent pro|fit by Commerce and Traffick with the Na|tives, and the <HI>Dutch;</HI> And though in &s;ome places the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had erected &s;ome Forts, and &s;etled &s;ome Strength, yet it was not by any Force or Violence, nor again&s;t the good will of the People of the Country, but with their own good liking, and con&s;ent, for the better &s;ecurity of their Trade, and upon the voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the Natives to the Obedience and Soveraignty of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> in which &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion the Antient Laws and Liberties of the &s;aid Natives, and all their own Immunities were comprehend|ed, and re&s;erved: In this E&s;tabli&s;hment the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did conceive them&s;elves to be &s;e|cure enough; when behold the <HI>Dutch</HI> (who would be no better Neighbours to us in the <HI>Indies</HI> then in <HI>Europe</HI>) began to quarrel with us, and to hinder us in our Trade to free Places, the which the better to obtain, they oftentimes &s;eized upon our Ships, and
<PB REF="4"> Goods, and finding this violence not to An|&s;wer their Expectation, they at the la&s;t con|trived to make them&s;elves the ab&s;olute Masters of the va&s;t profits of tho&s;e Places; In the pur&s;uit whereof, they have razed and demoli&s;hed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forts, and laying violent hands on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> them&s;elves, who made not the lea&s;t Re&s;istance; they have tyed them to &s;takes with Ropes about their Necks; they have &s;eized upon their Goods, they have Impri&s;oned their Per&s;ons, they have Whipped them at the Po&s;t in the open Market Place, and having wa&s;hed their torn and wounded Bodies with Vinegar and Salt, they have again doubled their &s;courges to multiply their Torments; they have drag|ged them from thence to places almo&s;t inac|ce&s;&s;ible, by rea&s;on of their &s;teepne&s;s and roughne&s;s, and having thrown them down the Rocks, if any Sence of life remained, they have added new oppre&s;&s;ion to their weary and brui&s;ed limbs, by the heavy weights of Iron; To the&s;e deliberate Torments the cru|elties of other Nations are but Courte&s;ies, and Death it &s;elf a Mercy; And as if they were the ab&s;olute Lords in the <HI>Indies</HI> they have a&s;&s;umed a Power to them&s;elves in the deciding of the controver&s;ies between the
<PB REF="4"> <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> for matters pa&s;&s;ed quite out of their juri&s;diction, and when Law and Right have pleaded again&s;t them, they have Executed their Decrees by violence. The&s;e be they who have laid a claim to His Maje&s;ties Intere&s;ts on his own Britti&s;h Seas, and rather then allow them proper unto Him, they have declared them common unto All: At the fir&s;t they begged leave for their Fi&s;h|ing on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seas, which being grant|ed them by the accu&s;tomed Indulgence of our Princes, they have &s;o pre&s;umed upon their lenity, that at the la&s;t they have made a Law in their own Country, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hal Sell no white Herrings, nor other Fi&s;h there upon penalty of Confi&s;cation; They are Fi&s;h|ing on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Seas from <HI>June</HI> unto <HI>November,</HI> and &s;eem there to dwel among&s;t the Fi&s;h for <HI>26</HI> weeks together, in which time the havock which they make in destroy|ing the Spawn and Fry of Fi&s;h that comes in|to their Netts, and otherwi&s;e is as remarka|ble as what they carry away with them.

<P><HI>The value of which 2000 Cart-loads, do amount to 90000 Bu&s;hels of fre&s;h Fi&s;h, &s;ix Quarters going to a Cart-load, which one with another being rated at five &s;hillings a Bu&s;hel, doth amount in currant</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Money, to the &s;um of 20500</HI>l.</P>

<PB REF="5">
<P>If by our own Neglect, &s;o great a de&s;tructi|on of Fi&s;h is made in our own Rivers, what may we conceive the di&s;orders to be which are made on the <HI>Engli&s;h Seas,</HI> by tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, to think all is Fi&s;h that comes to Net, and who&s;e Trade to Plunder; The time of our patience hath been long, their promi&s;es of Redre&s;s numerous, and the daily Injuries we have received in&s;upportable: To give you in this place a more large Ac|count of them, were to Anticipate your Un|derstanding; I &s;hall therefore for your fur|ther Satisfaction, refer you to the particulars in the Book it &s;elf: <HI>Farewell.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Propriety and Dominion of the <HI>KING</HI> of Great <HI>Brittain</HI> on His <HI>SEAS;</HI> A&s;&s;erted against all Oppo&s;ers, and Confirmed from all Ages, to this Pre&s;ent Time.</HEAD>
<P>_FOR the better Under|&s;tanding of the follow|ing Di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hall in the fir&s;t place lay down the&s;e Two Propo|&s;itions:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>That the Sea by the Law of Na|ture and Nations is not common to all Men, but is capable of Private Dominion, as well as the Land.</HI></P>
<P>The Second, Is, <HI>That the KING of</HI> GREAT BRITTAIN <HI>Is LORD of the SEA Flowing about, as an In&s;epa|rable and Perpetual Appendant of the</HI> Brit|ti&s;h <HI>Empire.</HI></P>
<PB N="2" REF="10">
<P>Before we &s;hall in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e Pro|po&s;itions, We &s;hall in the fir&s;t place, remove &s;ome Objections that may be made again&s;t them: Some are drawn from the Freedome of Commerce or Traffique, which by many are affirmed to be &s;o Naturall, that they can no where be aboli&s;hed by any Law or Cu&s;tome, and that by the Law of Na|tions it is unju&s;t to Deny Merchants the Benefit of Commerce and Navi|gation.</P>
<P>Other Objections are drawn from the Nature of the Sea it &s;elf, for it is com|monly alleaged that the Sea is altered, and &s;hifted every Moment, and the State thereof, through a continued &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of new waters, alwayes uncer|tain, and remains &s;o little the &s;ame in all things, (the Channel onely exce|pted) that it is impo&s;sible it &s;hould ever be retained in the Po&s;&s;e&s;sion of any One Particular.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, It is ea&s;ie to be pro|ved by the Ancient Interpreters of the <HI>Mo&s;aical</HI> Law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyren. ad Numer. 34.</NOTE> That the Sea is altoge|ther as capable of Private Dominion, as the Land; The Words of GOD in
<PB N="3" REF="10"> the Book of <HI>Numbers</HI> are expre&s;s; <HI>And let your Borders be the Great Sea;</HI> that is, &s;ay the <HI>Rabbins,</HI> the main Ocean, and its I&s;les; And it is plainly to be proved, that a Private Dominion of the Sea no otherwi&s;e then of Land aro&s;e from humane Di&s;tribution: We read,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dion. lib. 36.</NOTE> that <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, being Ma&s;ter of a Huge Navy, had a Commi&s;sion given him from the Senate, as ab&s;olute Lord of the Sea; The like had <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> &s;ome few years after him; And many of the Roman Hi&s;torians have called the Sea, their Sea; becau&s;e it was wholly &s;ubdued to the Roman Power.</P>
<P>We might here alleage many Ex|amples how long the <HI>Lidians,</HI> the <HI>Phygi|ans,</HI> the <HI>Rhodians,</HI> the <HI>Phaenicians,</HI> and many other Ea&s;tern Nations, one after another have been Lords of the Sea: Thy Borders are in the mid&s;t or heart of the Sea &s;aith the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> of the <HI>Tyrians: Quintus Curtius</HI> affirmeth, that the City of <HI>Tyre</HI> builded by <HI>Agenor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chron. Ca|non. <HI>p.</HI> 128.</NOTE> made not onely the neighbouring Sea, but what Seas &s;oever her &s;hips &s;ayled into, to be of her Dominion: There was an ancient cu&s;tome u&s;ed in the
<PB N="4" REF="11"> Ea&s;t, that when Great Kings had a de|&s;ign to bring any Nation under their Power, they commanded Water, and Earth, the pledges of Empire and Do|minion to be delivered unto them, conceiving that the Command of the Sea, as well as the Land was &s;ignified by &s;uch a token.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Florus, lib. 2. cap. 6.</NOTE>The like may be affirmed of the We&s;t, for both <HI>Polybeius,</HI> and <HI>Appian</HI> af|firme that the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> Enjoy|ed the Command of the Sea without all Controver&s;y, as received from their Ance&s;tors; And if we take a view of the&s;e late Times, as to the Rights and Cu&s;tomes of other Nations, which at this pre&s;ent are in high Reputation, we &s;hall finde that the Common-Wealth of <HI>Venice</HI> have enjoyed the Dominion of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea for many Ages: The <HI>Tu&s;cans</HI> to this day have an Ab&s;olute Dominion in the <HI>Tyrhene</HI> Sea, and tho&s;e of <HI>Genoa</HI> in the <HI>Lygu&s;tick;</HI> the like we may alledge of the <HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and the People of <HI>Norway;</HI> And to conclude, that the Dominion of the Sea is admitted a|mong&s;t tho&s;e things that are lawfull,
<PB N="5" REF="11"> and received into the Cu&s;tomes of Na|tions, is &s;o far from contradiction, that nothing at all can be found to con|troule it in the Cu&s;tomes of our latter Times, unle&s;&s;e it be by &s;ome, who be|ing Borderers upon the Sea-Domini|ons of others, do &s;trive to violate the Rights of their Neighbours, under the preten&s;e of Civil Community.</P>
<P>Now as to the Objection concern|ing the Freedome of Commerce and Pa&s;&s;age pretended to be common to All; It is mo&s;t evident from the Cu|&s;tomes of all Times, that Commerce, and Free Pa&s;&s;age hath ever been &s;o li|mited by Princes in their Territories, that it is either permitted, or prohibi|ted according to the various Concern|ments of the Publick Good. Princes are concerned to be wary and carefull, that they admit no &s;uch Strangers or Commerce where the Common-Wealth may receive any Damage thereby: And <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> plainly and ex|pre&s;ly &s;aith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ari&s;to. Po|lit. lib. 7. cap. 6.</NOTE> That provi&s;ion ought to be made by Lawes, with whom Sub|jects may, or may not conver&s;e: More|over it is commonly provided in
<PB N="6" REF="12"> Leagues, that it &s;hall not be lawfull for either Party to &s;ayle into each o|thers Ports, Coa&s;ts, or Harbours with &s;uch a number of Ships, as may give a ju&s;t occa&s;ion of Fear or Jealou&s;ie that Force is intended; except leave be fir&s;t had of that Party under who&s;e Juri&s;|diction tho&s;e Places are, or unle&s;s they be driven thither by Tempe&s;t, or other Nece&s;&s;ity, to avoid a greater Force, or the Danger of Shipwrack: And to con|clude, <HI>Bodine</HI> affirmeth, That it is law|full to prohibite any Forreigner from entring the Borders, and al&s;o to force him out, if he hath entred the Borders, not only if a War be on foot, but al&s;o in Time of Peace, that the Priviledges, Safety, and Welfare of the Inhabitants may not be corrupted by conver&s;ation with Strangers.</P>
<P>As to that Objection concerning the uncertainty of the Sea, which (it is al|ledged) doth render it unfit for private Dominion, becau&s;e it is ever in mo|tion, and in no wi&s;e remains the &s;ame: Suppo&s;e we grant that it be &s;o flowing, as is u&s;ualy &s;aid of the mo&s;t Northernly Seas;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strabo. Geograp. lib. 1.</NOTE> yet certainly the Channels, and
<PB N="7" REF="12"> Places through which the waters flow remain ever the &s;ame, although the waters them&s;elves do &s;hift, and change continually. In the <HI>Germane</HI> Empire, (according to the Civil Law) Rivers are all of them of Publick U&s;e, yet for all that, they are reckoned in the Em|perours private Patrimony,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seneca Ep. 39.</NOTE> and a|mong&s;t the Royalties belonging to his Exchequer; So that the Emperour, or others by his Grant, have a yearly Revenue out of the Fi&s;heries in them; Neither is there any thing more com|mon then an A&s;&s;erting of the Private Dominion of Rivers, in the Lawes of <HI>France, Spain, Poland,</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> and, in a word, of all Nations who&s;e Cu&s;tomes are known; &s;eeing therefore that a Do|minion and Propriety of Rivers hath been every where acknowledged, why &s;hould it not in the like manner be ac|knowledged, that there may be Ow|ners of any Sea what&s;oever? Since the always running and flowing Nature of water can no more hinder a Dominion in the one, then in the other, for the Rivers them&s;elves are but little Seas; as the Sea it &s;elf, to its fluide Con&s;ti|tution,
<PB N="8" REF="13"> is but a River, the one differing only in bignes from the other; and &s;o it hath been taken by the Antients; In the very Hi&s;tory of the Creation, all the Gatherings together of the waters are called Seas: Many Lakes have been called Seas; <HI>Tiberias</HI> by St. <HI>Luke</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 5.1.</NOTE> is cal|led a Lake, but by the other Evange|li&s;ts a Sea. <HI>A&s;phaltites</HI> is by <HI>Pliny, Soli|nus,</HI> and others, termed a Lake, but by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Fourteenth of <HI>Gene&s;is, the Salt Sea,</HI> and by mo&s;t of the late Wri|ters, <HI>the Dead Sea.</HI></P>
<P>They indeed, who make u&s;e of &s;uch frivolous &s;ubtilties, as the&s;e to oppo&s;e the Dominion of the Sea de&s;erve to be turned over to the Phylo&s;ophers, <HI>He|raclitus</HI> and <HI>Epicharmus,</HI> who taught that every thing is &s;o altered, changed, and renewed, that nothing in this World continues the &s;ame, as it was in the in&s;tant immediately going be|fore. Our Bodies (&s;aith <HI>Seneca</HI>) are hurried like Rivers; what&s;oever thou &s;ee&s;t, runneth with Time; Not one of all tho&s;e things that are vi&s;ible contin|ueth; I even while&s;t I &s;peak of the&s;e changes am changed my &s;elf: But let
<PB N="9" REF="13"> &s;uch men as dream that the fluide In|con&s;tant Nature of the Sea di&s;proves the private Dominion of it, entertain the &s;ame opinion if they plea&s;e with the&s;e Men, and then they mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;sity grant al&s;o, that them&s;elves are not Owners or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, of Hou&s;es, Lands, or Money, or any other thing what&s;oever.</P>
<P>As to that Argument, that the water is open to All, and therefore by Law, it mu&s;t lye open at all times to all men, it is a very trifling Argument. Before the fir&s;t Di&s;tribution of things, there was no Land which did not lye open unto All before it came under particu|lar Po&s;&s;e&s;sion: In many places payment is made for the u&s;e of water; as among&s;t the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they have in <HI>Delph-Land</HI> a Cu&s;tome, called, <HI>Jus Grutae,</HI> which hath ever been under the care of tho&s;e Officers, called in <HI>Dutch, Pluymgraven,</HI> whereby the Beer-Brewers are obliged to pay them the hundreth part for the u&s;e of the water.</P>
<P>Some men may here object that &s;ay|ing of <HI>Antonius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Forcus in cap. Juris. cap. 9.</NOTE> <HI>I am Sovereign of the World, but the Law is Sovereign of the Sea.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="14"> The True and Genuine &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e words is this, I am Lord of the World, becau&s;e I Govern the World by my own Law; but the <HI>Rhodian</HI> Law, is the Law of the Sea, becau&s;e by this Law <HI>Ju|stice</HI> is admini&s;tred on the Sea; there|fore let this ca&s;e of <HI>Eudaemon</HI> concern|ing Navigation be determined by the <HI>Rhodian</HI> Law, &s;o far as none of our Lawes doth oppo&s;e the &s;ame. There is no man unle&s;&s;e he will renounce his own Rea&s;on, who will affirme, that any Denial is made of the Dominion of the Sea in that An&s;wer, or that the lea&s;t Tittle can be found in it again&s;t the Dominion thereof.</P>

<P>Neither hath the High Court of Par|liament onely given this Atte&s;tation to our Kings, as <HI>Supream</HI> and <HI>Sovereign</HI> of the Seas: But to confirme it, we &s;hall produce the Te&s;timonies of <HI>Robert Bel|knap,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rich. 2.

<P>Neither is this Truth confirmed on|ly by our Laws, but by our Medals. There hath been a piece of Gold very often Coyned by our Kings, called a <HI>Ro&s;e-Noble,</HI> which was &s;tamped on the one &s;ide of it with a Ship, floting in the Sea, and a King Armed with a Sword and Shield, &s;itting in the Ship it &s;elf, as in a Throne, to &s;et forth a Repre&s;en|tation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> K. by Sea: The fir&s;t Authour hereof was <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, when he Guarded his own Seas with a Numerous Navy, con&s;i&s;ting of Eleven Hundred &s;hips, at which time, as at o|thers he marched victoriou&s;ly through <HI>France:</HI> But what need we labour to produce &s;o many Te&s;timonies at home from our Records in the <HI>Tower</HI> and other places, from our High Courts of Parliament, from our Laws, from our Coyns, &amp; from our Hi&s;tories, to prove this Truth; &s;ince it is acknowledged even by Forreigners them&s;elves whom it mo&s;t concerneth, by their u&s;ual &s;tri|king of &s;ayles, according to the antient
<PB N="38" REF="28"> Cu&s;tom by every &s;hip of any Forreign Nation what&s;oever, if they &s;ayle near the Kings Navy, or any &s;hip belonging to it at Sea, which is done not onely in Honour to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> King, but al&s;o in acknowledgement of His Sovereignty, and Dominion at Seas. The Antiquity of this Cu&s;tome, and that it hath been in u&s;e for above the&s;e Four Hundred years may appear by this following te|&s;timony: <HI>At</HI> Ha&s;tings, <HI>a Town &s;cituate up|on the Shore of</HI> Su&s;&s;ex, <HI>it was Decreed by K.</HI> John, <HI>in the Second Year of His Reign, with the A&s;&s;ent of His Peers, That if the Governour, or Commander of the Kings Navy in His Naval Expeditions &s;hall meet with any Ships what&s;oever by Sea, either Laden or Empty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M^r.

<PB N="39" REF="28"> the King, yet the per&s;ons who &s;hall be found in the&s;e Ships, are to be puni&s;hed with Im|pri&s;onment at di&s;cretion for their Rebel|lion.</HI> It was accounted Trea&s;on (&s;aith Ma&s;ter <HI>Selden) If any &s;hip what&s;oever had not acknowledged the Dominion of the King of</HI> England <HI>in His own Sea by striking &s;ayle, and they were not to be protected upon the Account of Amity, who &s;hould in any wi&s;e pre&s;ume to do the contrary; Penalties were al&s;o appointed by the Kings of</HI> Eng|land <HI>in the &s;ame manner, as if mention were made concerning a Crime committed in &s;ome Territory of his Land.</HI></P>
<P>But above all, that as yet hath been &s;aid, there can hardly be alledged a more convincing Argument, to prove the Truth of all that hath hitherto been &s;poken, then the Acknowledgement of the Sea-Dominion of the King of <HI>England</HI> by very many of our Neigh|bouring Nations.

<P>WHether the final re&s;olution here will be according to His Maje|&s;ties de&s;ire, in that point concerning the Fi&s;hing upon the Coa&s;ts of His Three Kingdomes, I cannot &s;ay; And by &s;omewhat which fell from the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> by way of Di&s;cour&s;e when he took leave of me on <HI>Monday</HI> la&s;t, at his Departure; I &s;u&s;pect it will not, in regard the Magi&s;trates of the&s;e Towns of <HI>Holland,</HI> being newly pla|ced, and yet &s;carce fa&s;t in their Seats, who do Authorize the Deputies which come hither to the A&s;&s;embly of the States in all things they are to Treat and Re&s;olve, will not Adventure for fear of the people, to determine of a Bu&s;ine&s;s, on which the livelihood of Fifty Thou&s;and of the Inhabitants of this one &s;ingle Province doth depend.

<OPENER><SALUTE>(SIR,)</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY Your Letters and otherwi&s;e, I perceive many jealou&s;ies and di&s;|cour&s;es are rai&s;ed upon the preparati|ons of His Maje&s;ties Fleet, which is now in &s;uch forwardne&s;s, that we doubt not but within this Month it will appear at Sea. It is therefore expe|dient both for your &s;atisfaction and di|rection, to inform you particularly what was the occa&s;ion, and what is His Maje&s;ties intention in this work.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, we hold it a principle not to be denied, That the King of Great <HI>Brit|tain,</HI> is a Monarch at Land and Sea to the full extent of His Dominions, and that it concerneth him as much to maintain His Soveraignty in all the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Seas, as within His three King|doms: becau&s;e without that, the&s;e cannot be kept &s;afe; nor he pre&s;erve
<PB N="68" REF="43"> his honour and due re&s;pect with other Nations. But commanding the Seas, he may cau&s;e his Neighbours and all Countries to &s;tand upon their guard when&s;oever he thinks fit. And this cannot be doubted that who&s;oever will encroach upon him by Sea, will do it by Land al&s;o when they &s;ee their time. To &s;uch pre&s;umption <HI>Mare liberum</HI> gave the fir&s;t warning-piece, which mu&s;t be an&s;wered with a defence of <HI>Mare clau|&s;um:</HI> not &s;o much by Di&s;cour&s;es, as by the louder Language of a powerful Navy, to be better under&s;tood, when over&s;trained patience &s;eeth no hope of pre&s;erving her Right by other means.</P>
<P>The Degrees by which his Maje&s;ties Dominion at Sea hath of latter years been fir&s;t impeached and then que&s;ti|oned, are as con&s;iderable as notorious.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to cheri&s;h, and as it were to nouri&s;h up our unthankful Neighbors, We gave them leave to gather wealth and &s;trength upon our Coa&s;ts, in our Ports, by our Trade, and by our Peo|ple. Then they were glad to invite our Merchants Re&s;idence, with what priviledges they would de&s;ire. Then
<PB N="69" REF="43"> they offered to us even the Soveraign|ty of their E&s;tates, and then they &s;ued for Licen&s;e to Fi&s;h upon the Coa&s;ts, and obtained it under the Great Seal of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which now they &s;uppre&s;&s;e. And when thus by leave or by conni|vence, they had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of our Fi&s;hings, not onely in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but in <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> and by our Staple had rai&s;ed a great &s;tock of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rade; by the&s;e means they &s;o encrea&s;ed their Shiping and power at Sea, that now they endure not to be kept at any di|&s;tance: Nay, they are grown to that confidence to keep guards upon our Seas; and then to project an Office and Company of A&s;&s;urance for the Ad|vancement of Trade; and withal pro|hibit us free commerce even within our Seas, and take our Ships and goods, if we conform not to their <HI>Placarts.</HI> What in&s;olencies and cruelties they have committed again&s;t us heretofore, in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in <HI>Greenland,</HI> and in the <HI>In|dies,</HI> is too well known to all the world. In all which, though our &s;ufferings and their wrong may &s;eem forgotten, yet the great intere&s;t of His Maje&s;ties
<PB N="70" REF="44"> honour, is &s;till the &s;ame, and will re|fre&s;h their Memories as there &s;hall be+cau&s;e. For, though charity mu&s;t re|mit wrongs done to private men, yet the reflection upon the publick may make it a greater charity to do Ju&s;tice on crying crimes. All this notwith|&s;tanding, you are not to conceive that the work of this Fleet, is either re|venge or execution of Ju&s;tice for the&s;e great offences pa&s;t, but chiefly for the future to &s;top the violent Current of that pre&s;umption whereby the Men of War and Free-booters of all Nations (abu&s;ing the favour of His Maje&s;ties peaceable and gracious Government, whereby he hath permitted all His Friends and Allies, to make u&s;e of His Seas and Ports in a rea&s;onable and free manner, and according to his Treaties) have taken upon them the boldne&s;s, not only to come confidently at all times into all his Ports and Rivers, but to convey their Merchants &s;hips as high as his chief City, and then to ca&s;t An|chor clo&s;e upon his Magazins, and to contemn the Commands of his Offi|cers, when they required a farther di|&s;tance:
<PB N="71" REF="44"> But which is more intolerable, have a&s;&s;aulted and taken one another within his Maje&s;ties Chamber, and within his Rivers, to the &s;corn and con|tempt of his Dominion and Power; and this being of late years an ordinary practice which we have endeavoured in vain to reform by the ways of Ju|&s;tice and Treaties, the world I think will now be &s;atisfied, that we have rea&s;on to look about us. And no wi&s;e man will doubt that it is high time to put our &s;elves in this Equipage upon the Seas, and not to &s;uffer that Stage of Action to be taken from us for want of our appearance.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee the general ground upon which our Coun&s;els &s;tands. In parti|cular, you may take notice, and pub|li&s;h as cau&s;e requires, That His Maje|&s;ty by this Fleet intendeth not a Rup|ture with any Prince or State, nor to infringe any point of his Treaties; but re&s;olveth to continue and maintain that happy peace wherewith God hath ble&s;&s;ed his Kingdom, and to which, all his Actions and Negotiations have hitherto tended, as by your own in|&s;tructions
<PB N="72" REF="45"> you may fully under&s;tand. But withal con&s;idering, that Peace mu&s;t be maintained by the arme of power, which onely keeps down War by keeping up Dominion; His Ma|je&s;ty thus provoked, finds it nece&s;|&s;ary even for his own defence and &s;afety, to re-a&s;&s;ume and keep his antient and undoubted Right in the Dominion of the&s;e Seas, and to &s;uf|fer no other Prince or State to en|croach upon him, thereby a&s;&s;uming to them&s;elves or their Admirals, any Soveraign command: but to force them to perform due homage to his Admirals and Ships, and to pay them acknowledgements, as in former times they did. He will al&s;o &s;et open and protect the free Trade both of his Subjects and Alies: And give them &s;uch &s;afe Conduct and Con|voy, as they &s;hall rea&s;onably re|quire. He will &s;uffer no other Fleets or Men of War to keep any guard upon the&s;e Seas, or there to offer violence or take prizes or boo|ties, or to give interruption to any lawfull intercour&s;e. In a word, his
<PB N="73" REF="45"> Maje&s;ty is re&s;olved, as to do no wrong, &s;o to do Ju&s;tice both to his Subjects and Friends, within the li|mits of his Seas. And this is the real and Royal de&s;ign of this Fleet, whereof you may give part as you finde occa&s;ion to our good Neigh|bours in tho&s;e parts, that no Um|brage may be taken of any ho&s;tile act or purpo&s;e to their prejudice in any kinde.

<P N="5">5.

<P N="6"><PB N="97" REF="57">6.

<P>Becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fi&s;her-men dwelling on the Sea-Coa&s;ts did leave off their Trade of Fi&s;hing in our Seas, and went the half-Seas over, and there|upon they did buy Fi&s;h of <HI>Pickards, Flemmings, Normans,</HI> and <HI>Zelanders,</HI> by rea&s;on whereof many incommodities did grow to the Realm, <HI>viz.</HI> the decay of the wealth and pro&s;perity as well of the Cinque-Ports, and Members of the &s;ame, as of other Coa&s;t-Towns by the Sea-&s;ide, which were builded, and inhabited by great multitudes of peo|ple, by rea&s;on of u&s;ing and exerci&s;ing, the craft and feat of Fi&s;hing.

<P>This Act by many continuances was continued from Parliament to Parlia|ment, until the fir&s;t of Queen <HI>Marie,</HI> and from thence to the end of the next Parliament, and then expired.</P>
<P>For Conclu&s;ion, &s;eeing, by that which hath formerly been declared, it evidently appeareth, that the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> by immemorable pre&s;crip|tion, continual u&s;age, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the acknowledgment of all our Neigh|bour-States, and the Municipal Laws of the Kingdom, have ever held the Sovereign Lord&s;hip of the Seas of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and that unto his Maje&s;ty, by rea&s;on of his Sovereignty, the &s;upream command and Juri&s;diction over the pa&s;&s;age, and Fi&s;hing in the &s;ame right|fully apperteineth; con&s;idering al&s;o the natural Scite of tho&s;e our Seas that interpo&s;e them&s;elves between the great Northern Commerce of that of the whole world, and that of the Ea&s;t,
<PB N="100" REF="59"> We&s;t, and Southern Climates, and withal the infinite commodities that by Fi&s;hing in the &s;ame is daily made; It cannot be doubted, but his Maje&s;ty, by means of his own excellent Wi&s;|dom and Virtue, and by the Indu&s;try of his faithful Subjects and People, may ea&s;ily, without inju&s;tice to any Prince or Per&s;on what&s;oever, be made the greate&s;t Monarch for Command and Wealth, and his People the mo&s;t opu|lent and Flouri&s;hing Nation of any o|ther in the world. And this the ra|ther, for that his Maje&s;ty is now ab&s;o|lute Commander of the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> I&s;le, and hath al&s;o enlarged his Dominions over a great part of the We&s;tern <HI>In|dies;</HI> by means of which extent of Em|pire, (cro&s;&s;ing in a manner the whole Ocean) the Trade and per&s;ons of all Nations (removing from one part of the world to the other) mu&s;t of nece&s;|&s;ity fir&s;t, or la&s;t, come within compa&s;s of his power and juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>And therefore the Sovereignty of our Seas, being the mo&s;t precious Jew|el of his Maje&s;tie's Crown, and (next

<PB N="145" REF="81"> numbers, and four hundred of the Chiefe&s;t of them being picked out a|mong&s;t the re&s;t, they were tran&s;ported into an adjacent I&s;land, where having wa&s;hed them&s;elves, accordingly as they had been advi&s;ed, they were all invited to a great dinner, and intreated with many welcomes; they told them, they were heartily &s;orry that they &s;hould &s;o much di&s;tru&s;t them as to fly to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> there being none that de&s;ired their &s;afety and welfare more then them&s;elves, and that they would befriend them again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers; they de&s;ired that all differences what|&s;oever may be ab&s;olutely compo&s;ed, and all former injuries forgotten; to which purpo&s;e, to give them a mani|fe&s;tation of their Re&s;pects, they had tran&s;ported them thither, and provi|ded what for the pre&s;ent could be had for their Refre&s;hment. The Poor In|habitants being much &s;urprized at this unu&s;ual manner of Re&s;pect, having fed heartily, and expre&s;&s;ed their thankful|ne&s;s, prepared for their departure; but the <HI>Dutch</HI> leading them to a window, told them, that they mu&s;t walk to yon|der
<PB N="146" REF="82"> Green, and take their Farewell of them there, for there their Executi|oners &s;tood in a readine&s;s to di&s;patch them; whereat the poor <HI>Bandene&s;es</HI> be|ing much amazed, cryed out, <HI>O Apetow!</HI> which is in <HI>Engli&s;h, O what is this!</HI> Im|mediately they were hurried away to the place of Execution, and by the <HI>Ia|pan</HI> Slaves, the cruel In&s;truments of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they were cut a&s;under in the middle alive, and their divided Quarters were &s;ent &s;ome of them to <HI>Lantore,</HI> &s;ome of them to <HI>Polleroon,</HI> and other I&s;lands belonging unto <HI>Banda.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame year, they put to Death the Chiefe&s;t of the Inhabitants of <HI>Polle|roon,</HI> among&s;t whom was the Chief Prie&s;t of that I&s;land, in who&s;e &s;ide the <HI>Dutch</HI> having cut a hole, they com|manded that Gun-powder &s;hould be put into it, which at that in&s;tant being &s;et on fire, by a new way of torment they deprived him of his life.</P>
<P>It is very ob&s;ervable, that although the&s;e Inhabitants of <HI>Polleroon</HI> were un|der the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Protection, yet their numbers being incon&s;iderable to the &s;trength of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> dur&s;t

<P>And in this place I &s;hall not forget to give you the memorable account of the innumerable Shoales of <HI>Mackerell</HI> which was the Chiefe&s;t thing that &s;up|ported tho&s;e I&s;lands, they came always in their &s;ea&s;on in great Multitudes, and if at any time they appeared not &s;o numerous, they were &s;ure to have arrived within the limits of two or three dayes, and in far greater abun|dance then u&s;ually before; but after that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had left tho&s;e I&s;lands, they did for&s;ake them al&s;o, as places polluted with Blood, and Avarice, or

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide, <HI>The</HI> Dutch <HI>Ty|ranny,</HI> pag. 64.</NOTE>Much about the &s;ame time, Cap|tain <HI>Iourdan</HI> &s;ayling from <HI>Bantham</HI> with two Ships, the one called the <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> the other the <HI>Hound,</HI> to the great I&s;lands of <HI>Burnew,</HI> he di&s;covered three or four <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships &s;tanding in for the &s;ame Port, and being confident that they in|tended no good to him, he gave order to prepare for the Encounter, fully re|&s;olving to fight it out to the la&s;t Man, rather then to yield him&s;elf to the un|merciful hands of his In&s;ulting and Ap|proaching Enemies; the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;um|moned the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to deliver the Ships upon fair Quarter, but Captain <HI>Iourdan</HI> a well complexioned Man, who had a great heart in a little body, ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to yield upon any Condition what&s;oever. The <HI>Dutch</HI> pretending to be unwilling to &s;hed blood, called out to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and told them, that they knew very well that little Cap|tain <HI>Iourdan</HI> was there, and de&s;ired them to per&s;wade him to Parley with
<PB N="149" REF="83"> them; Captain <HI>Iourdan</HI> being inform|ed of it, refu&s;ed to have any conference with them; whereupon they de&s;ired that he would but &s;how him&s;elf upon the Quarter Deck, that by a fair com|plyance they might &s;top the effu&s;ion of blood, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t come to pa&s;s; Whereupon Captain <HI>Iourdan</HI> (thinking that to &s;peak with them could not much prejudice him) did &s;how him&s;elf on the Quarter Deck, &amp; after the exchange of &s;ome few words, told them, that he knew the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e, and the Inju&s;tice of Theirs, and was re&s;olved to fight it out: The <HI>Hollander</HI> alledging that their &s;trength was far greater then his, and it was ra|ther De&s;paratene&s;s then true Valour to fight upon &s;uch a Di&s;advantage; it prevailed nothing at all with Captain <HI>Iourdan,</HI> who told them, he que&s;tioned not his own &s;trength, but was re&s;olved to fight it out, and to leave the &s;uc|ce&s;s unto God. The <HI>Dutch</HI> finding him intractable to their Demands, did hold him &s;till in Di&s;cour&s;e, until a Mu&s;quet Bullet from one of their &s;hips laid him dead upon the Deck, as he was in Par|ley

<P>In the mean time the Governour and the Fi&s;cal intend to lo&s;e no oppor|tunity, in the pro&s;ecution of the fine Plot that was contrived; <HI>Iohn Beaumont,</HI> and <HI>Timothy Iohn&s;on</HI> are &s;ent for from aboard the <HI>Unicorn;</HI> Being come into the Ca&s;tle, <HI>Beaumont</HI> was left with a Guard in the Hall, and <HI>Iohn&s;on</HI> was ta|ken into the place of Torture, where by and by to the great grief and a&s;toni&s;h|ment of his heart and under&s;tanding, <HI>Beaumont</HI> heard him to make a la|mentable Out-cry, and then to be &s;i|lent for a little while, and not long af|terwards to be as loud in his hideous complaints, if not louder then before; After this Torture <HI>Abel Price</HI> the Chy|rurgion, who was fir&s;t of all wracked, was brought in to accu&s;e him; But <HI>Iohn&s;ons</HI> heart being as &s;tout as it was
<PB N="156" REF="87"> innocent, and not confe&s;&s;ing any thing, he was remanded to the Torture again, where <HI>Beaumont</HI> heard him to roar, and cea&s;e from roaring, and then to roar out again, enough to &s;often the harde&s;t &s;tones into compa&s;&s;ion; Having been a whole hour in this Purgatory of Fire and Water, they brought him forth wet all over, and burned in &s;everall places of his body, and &s;o laid a&s;ide in a by-place in the Hall, with a Souldier to watch him that he &s;hould &s;peak to no man. After him <HI>Emanuel Tomp&s;on</HI> was examined in a room adjoyning to that where <HI>Iohn&s;on</HI> had been Tortured, where being an hour and a half in his Examination, and his Torment, he was carried another way, and pa&s;&s;ed not through the Hall, where <HI>Beaumont</HI> attended, and every hour expected the dreadfull &s;ummons; At the la&s;t, <HI>Beau|mont</HI> was called in, and with deep pro|te&s;tations denying what was propound|ed to him, he was made fa&s;t to the Rack, and the cloath being tyed about his Neck, and two men with Jarrs of Water in their hands being ready to pour it on his head, the Governour
<PB N="157" REF="87"> commanded that he &s;hould be taken down again, &s;aying, that he would for|bear him a day or two longer, becau&s;e he was an Old Man.</P>
<P>The next day being Sunday, <HI>Robert Brown</HI> was called in, and being on the Rack, and the Torment of Water gi|ven him, he confe&s;&s;ed all as the Fi&s;cal a&s;ked. After him was <HI>Edward Collins</HI> called in, who&s;e Hand and Feet being fa&s;tned to the Rack, he prayed to be re|&s;pited, &s;aying, he would confe&s;s all; But being let down, with great Oaths and Execrations he prote&s;ted his inno|cency as before, yet told them, that be|cau&s;e he knew that by Torture, they would make him to confe&s;s any thing, though never &s;o contrary to the Truth, they &s;hould do him a great favour to tell him what they would have him to confe&s;s, and he would acknowledge it to avoid the torture; At which the Fi&s;|cal being angry, he was hoy&s;ted up a|gain, and the Torment of Water being given him, he was not able to endure it, but prayed to be let down again to his Confe&s;&s;ion, After which having deliberated a little with him&s;elf, he
<PB N="158" REF="88"> confe&s;&s;ed he had a hand in the Plot for the &s;urpri&s;al of the Ca&s;tle, and being demanded of the Fi&s;cal, whether Cap|tain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> were not an A&s;&s;ociate in the Con&s;piracy; He An&s;wered, No; Whereupon the Fi&s;cal told him, that he lied, for &s;aid he, Did not he call all of you of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factories unto him, and tell you, that the daily Af|fronts and Abu&s;es of the <HI>Dutch</HI> had put a Plot into his head, and that he want|ed nothing but your Con&s;ent and Se|crecy? A <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant &s;tanding by &s;aid; And did not you all &s;wear upon the Bible to be &s;ecret to him? <HI>Collins</HI> with great Prote&s;tations replyed, that he knew nothing at all of it: Being then delivered again into the hands of the Executioner, the &s;en&s;e of the late Torture &s;o prevailed upon him, that he confe&s;&s;ed all to be true which they had &s;poken. Being thus re&s;pited, he was demanded, whether the Pre&s;ident of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Iaccatra,</HI> or Ma&s;ter <HI>Welden</HI> Agent for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Banda</HI> were not privy to the bu&s;ine&s;s; to which he a|gain an&s;wered, No; Afterwards the Fi&s;cal propounded other Interrogato|ries
<PB N="159" REF="88"> unto him, and perceiving that <HI>Col|lins</HI> knew not what an&s;wer to make, he helped him to confe&s;s tho&s;e things which he thought mo&s;t conducing to his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Next to him was <HI>Samuel Col&s;on</HI> brought in, who for fear of the pain when he &s;aw <HI>Edward Collins</HI> come forth, cho&s;e rather to deny nothing that was propounded to him then undergo the Torments of Fire and Water in the Atte&s;tation of his Innocence: But <HI>Iohn Clark</HI> was of another Re&s;olution, he was no &s;ooner brought in by the Soul|diers and Officers, but by and by he was heard to make a hideous and a la|mentable complaint, which continued for the &s;pace of two hours, during which time as they abated or increa&s;ed his Torments, he dimini&s;hed or dou|bled his cryes at the Sen&s;e and horrour of his Sufferings. The two Elements of Fire and Water, although merciles of them&s;elves, by making their Fury more deliberate, were here in&s;tructed to be more unmercifull, whiles accu|rate cruelty did torment even inven|tion it &s;elf to torment the Innocent;
<PB N="160" REF="89"> The Rack ordained for the confe&s;&s;ion of great and grievous Offences is of|tentimes but an unfaithfull di&s;coverer of them; for whiles men are put to tho&s;e torments, which Fle&s;h and Blood are not able to endure, they confe&s;s tho&s;e crimes which their Fle&s;h and Blood were no wayes acce&s;&s;ary to. Two hours was this poor Man under the torment of Fire and Water, yet confe&s;&s;ed not any thing, at which his Tormentors being amazed, they did cut off his hair, thinking belike, that the &s;trength of his Re&s;olution lay in his hair, when indeed it lay in the Ju&s;tice of his Cau&s;e, and the Innocence of his Con&s;cience. Afterwards they hoy&s;ed him up again, and with lighted candles they did burn him in the bottom of his feet, untill the moi&s;ture that dropped from them did put out the candles, yet even then they applyed fre&s;h lights unto him; They burnt him al&s;o in the elbows, and in the palms of his hands, and &s;o horridly under his arm-pits, that his Inwards might evidently be &s;een; At the la&s;t, when they percei|ved that he could make no hand&s;ome
<PB N="161" REF="89"> Confe&s;&s;ion, they led him along with que&s;tions of particular circum&s;tances which they had fra|med of them&s;elves; And being wearied and overcome with Torments, he at la&s;t, according to their own wi&s;hes, made An&s;wer to what&s;o|ever they demanded of him. Being then re|lea&s;ed from his Martyrdom, they &s;ent him out by four <HI>Negroes,</HI> who carried him between them to a Dungeon, where he lay five dayes without any Chyrurgian to dre&s;s his wounds, untill his fle&s;h being putrified great Maggots creeped and dropped from him in a mo&s;t loath&s;om, and noy|&s;ome manner.</P>
<P>In the like manner, the re&s;t were all Exami|ned, but none of them were &s;o heavily Tortu|red, for &s;ome of them to avoid the Torment, made &s;uddain Confe&s;&s;ions, others at the fir&s;t or &s;econd drenching with the water, An&s;wered to all the Interrogatories of the Fi&s;cal. Captain <HI>Tower&s;on</HI> him&s;elf being re&s;erved among&s;t the la&s;t, untill the Torments of tho&s;e that were Ex|amined before him might Rack out &s;omething from them that might Evidence again&s;t Him, was brought into the Court, where the&s;e youn|kers of <HI>Holland,</HI> like another Council of <HI>Reho|boam</HI> &s;ate in Judgement upon Him, he deeply did prote&s;t his Innocence, to Encounter which they produced the Per&s;ons and Confe&s;&s;ions of
