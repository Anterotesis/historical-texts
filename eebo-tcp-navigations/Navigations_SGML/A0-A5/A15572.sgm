Now if thou ha&s;t &s;u&s;tained no lo&s;&s;e thy &s;elfe, perhaps thou wilt not beleeue the&s;e things to be true that I haue written: but if thou wilt or doe&s;t beleeue, then pray to God that it will plea&s;e him to giue them patience that are loo&s;ers, and humilitie that are winners, and giue God thankes that he hath &s;o ble&s;t thee that thou ha&s;t no &s;hare in the&s;e mi&s;|haps. But if thou wilt not beleeue, goe and looke, or el&s;e remaine &s;till in thy vnbeleife.</P>
