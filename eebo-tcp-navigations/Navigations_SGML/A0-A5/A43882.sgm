<HEAD>THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;o many disjointed Relations of Truth, and uncertain Reports hud|led and confus'd one among another, we do here pre&s;ent the Reader with a conti|nued Diary of the whole Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> from the very fir&s;t March of the Army that lay be|fore it, till the end of the Siege, which terminated in the Winning of the Town. The Gentleman that wrote it in <HI>French</HI> was, with|out que&s;tion, an Eye-witne&s;s of mo&s;t of tho&s;e bloody Tran&s;actions, as being an Imperiali&s;t, and upon the Theatre him&s;elf. Nor is it rea|&s;onable to mi&s;tru&s;t the Credit of a Per&s;on, who&s;e Zeal for the Common Cau&s;e makes him &s;o diligent as not to omit the lea&s;t Particular that may contribute to the Honour of &s;o many
<PB REF="3">Renowned Commanders, without detracting in the lea&s;t from the Gallantry of the Defendants. So that the Pa&s;&s;ages of every Day, thus clos'd and join'd together, yields a full Pro&s;pect of the Indu&s;try, Vigilancy, Courage, Re&s;olution, Experience and Conduct of Generals exact in Martial Affairs; and the Indefatigable Con|&s;tancy and Valour of Laborious and well-Di&s;ci|plin'd Soldiers. A Piece, which when the Curious in Hi&s;tory have read, they will find the Story of the mo&s;t Famous Siege in the World; the A&s;&s;ailants equalling, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;ing <HI>Ti|tus</HI> &s;urrounding <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and <HI>Abdi Ba&s;ha</HI> no le&s;s bravely ob&s;tinate in defending his Tru&s;t, than <HI>Villerius</HI> upon the Walls of <HI>Rhodes.</HI> Of which I &s;hall &s;ay no more in the Epi&s;tle, &s;ince the Book is &s;o near at hand.</P>

<HEAD>AN Hi&s;torical De&s;cription OF THE CONQUEST Of the CITY of BUDA.</HEAD>
<P>THE Divi&s;ions and Mi&s;-under&s;tandings that have reign'd among the Chri&s;tian Princes, gave the Mahometans an opportunity to &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome by Policy and Stratagem, others by the force of their triumphing Arms, and to con&s;train &s;ome, that were not in a condition to &s;top the Torrent of their formidable Armies, to put them&s;elves under their Protection, and acknowledge, by the payment of an Annual Tribute, the power of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; which in le&s;s than four Centuries has &s;pread it &s;elf to &s;uch a va&s;t Extent, and become &s;o terrible to all the Earth, that their Chief Sultans would &s;uffer no Superi|ours, nor acknowledge any Equals. True it is, the Po|tent <HI>Tamerlan</HI> King of the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Parthians,</HI> had the
<PB N="2" REF="4">good fortune to tame the Pride and haughty Arrogance of <HI>Bajazet:</HI> But his death, which happen'd in the flower of his Age, reviv'd the dejected courage of the <HI>Turks</HI> in &s;uch a manner, that they not only regain'd the King|doms and Countries which that victorious Prince had wre&s;ted out of their hands, but in proce&s;s of time forc'd the <HI>Parthians</HI> al&s;o and the <HI>Tartars</HI> to do them Homage, to pay 'em Tribute, and &s;ubmit to &s;uch Laws as the <HI>Otto|man</HI> Emperours thought fit to impo&s;e upon 'em.</P>
<P>The&s;e Barbarians have often attempted to bring <HI>Ger|many</HI> under their &s;ubjection; to which purpo&s;e they have &s;everal times, like an Inundation, with all the Forces of the Ea&s;t over-run <HI>Hungary, Au&s;tria,</HI> and the adjacent Countries; and had accompli&s;hed their de&s;igns, had not God in meer pity and compa&s;&s;ion, heard the Prayers of all Chri&s;tendom, and twice miraculou&s;ly delivered the City of <HI>Vienna</HI> from the fury of the Infidels: Fir&s;t, in the year 1529. when <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent with an Army of 300000 fighting Men had reduc'd it to the la&s;t extre|mity, by means of the bloody A&s;&s;aults with which he harra&s;s'd the Defendants without cea&s;ing; yet was con|&s;train'd to rai&s;e his Siege upon the approach of the Empe|ror <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth. The &s;econd time, in the year 1683. when a numerous <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, con&s;i&s;ting of above 200000. Men, under the Command of the Grand Vi&s;ier <HI>Cara Mu&s;tapha,</HI> attack'd that important Bulwark of <HI>Germany,</HI> with &s;o much fury, during a Siege of three Months, carried on with the greate&s;t vigor and ob&s;tina|cy that had been known for many Ages pa&s;t; &s;o that the place was driven to its la&s;t &s;hifts, and had certainly been forc'd to undergo the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Yoke, had not the God of Battels rais'd the <HI>Polonians, Bavarians, Saxons,</HI> and other Subjects of the Empire, to follow their &s;everal Princes, to the Succour of the capital City of <HI>Au|&s;tria;</HI> where they all equally &s;har'd the honour of fight|ing tho&s;e Infidels, and putting them to a &s;hameful flight,
<PB N="3" REF="4">with the lo&s;s of all their Baggage, Riches, Artillery, and a prodigious quantity of warlike Ammunition and Pro|vi&s;ions; and above fifty thou&s;and of their number &s;lain.</P>
<P>Since which time God approving the ju&s;tice of our thrice Illu&s;trious and Invincible Emperour's Cau&s;e, has in &s;uch a manner ble&s;t his victorious Armies, under the Conduct of the Brave and Generous Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the mo&s;t Serene Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> through the great Victories they have gain'd, and the glorious Con|que&s;ts they have made, during the whole cour&s;e of four <HI>Campagnes</HI> together, that they have &s;truck a Terror over all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire: So that the people not knowing where the fault lay, have mi&s;erably put to death the principal Mini&s;ters of the Port, and the be&s;t Officers of their Armies, imputing to them the cau&s;e of God's wrath, as now intending to de&s;troy their Empire, and exterminate the Law of their Prophet, for engaging them in an unju&s;t War, contrary to the opinion of their <HI>Mufti,</HI> who is the Oracle of the <HI>Turks,</HI> and to whom tho&s;e Infidels give as much credit, as the Chri&s;tians do to the Traditions and Writings of the true Prophets, and Doctors of the Church. This <HI>Mufti,</HI> who is the Inter|preter, and Di&s;pen&s;er, and con&s;equently the Head of the Mahometan Law, was the only per&s;on in the <HI>Divan,</HI> who endeavour'd to di&s;&s;wade the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> from entring into a War with the Emperor, in favour of <HI>Tecke|ly,</HI> foretelling him the cur&s;es that would fall upon his head, the hazard he would run of lo&s;ing his Empire, and &s;eeing it &s;har'd among the Chri&s;tian Princes; &s;aying withal, That God would never endure, that the <HI>Mu&s;&s;el|men,</HI> who had always been &s;o punctual in the ob&s;erva|tion of their Treaties, &s;hould violate a League two years before its expiration, and enter into an unju&s;t War, which would infallibly draw upon their heads the anger of the Almighty. And indeed he mi&s;s'd but little of moving the credulous People, and rou&s;ing up in their
<PB N="4" REF="5">minds an aver&s;ion to a War &s;o fatal and ruinous to their Repo&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to remedy &s;o many di&s;orders, and prevent the mi&s;chiefs threatned him from his own Sub|jects, u&s;ed all the means imaginable to put an end to this Bloody War; to which end he offer'd to make a Peace with the Emperour upon Articles favourable to Chri&s;tendom; and the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> having rejected his Propo&s;itions, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Republic of <HI>Venice,</HI> to bring 'em to a particular accommodation, and to break that Sacred League which our Holy Father <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. &s;o politick|ly contriv'd, and carry'd on at the expence of the Trea&s;ures of the Church, for the good of the Cau&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the Propagation of the True Faith.</P>
<P>In the mean time the great War-like preparations which the Emperour made in his Hereditary Countries, and other parts of <HI>Germany</HI> were carry'd on &s;o vigo|rou&s;ly, that all things were ready by the time appointed, to thunder in upon the Turki&s;h Garri&s;ons. The Artil|lery, the va&s;t number of Bombs, Granado's, Shells, and Fire-works, the inventions of a <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Monk, and the Sieur <HI>Gonzales,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ingineer, were &s;o dreadful, that well there could not any doubt be made of the happy i&s;&s;ue of one of the mo&s;t glorious and daring En|terpri&s;es that had been undertaken in a long time: And though the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> were in vain attempted in the year 1684. at what time it co&s;t us the blood of 10000. Chri&s;tians, the di&s;appointment of one Cam|pagne, and the expence of &s;o much Trea&s;ure; yet was not the Imperial Court di&s;courag'd from a &s;econd at|tempt, well knowing that upon the Conque&s;t of that important Capital, depended all the re&s;t of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the neighbouring Countries.</P>
<P>True it is, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> was not more &s;ucce&s;|ful in the fir&s;t Siege, than tho&s;e other Generals which
<PB N="5" REF="5">had preceded him in that Enterpri&s;e; however he fail'd not to acquire great honour, and made it apparent, that he might be compar'd with the mo&s;t renowned Captains, which pa&s;t Ages have admir'd, by that noble re|treat which he made in the face of a numerous Garri|&s;on, and an Army of the Enemies, little inferiour to his own; who dur&s;t not make the lea&s;t attempt upon his Rear, for fear of having no better &s;ucce&s;s than at the time of the Siege, during which the Duke had three times beaten the Sera&s;quier's Army; and had it not been that the Winter was already come, which caus'd a &s;carcity of Forrage, and other nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of the Armies, and &s;ome little mi&s;-under&s;tandings among the Generals, perhaps there might have been no need of a &s;econd Siege.</P>
<P>In the Council of War that was held the la&s;t year in pre&s;ence of the Emperor, to con&s;ult what was to be done the next Summer, there were &s;ome who pre&s;ently pro|pounded the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> and to keep the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> blockt up, that &s;o it might be compelled to yield of it &s;elf; which was rejected by others, who were of opinion, That Thorn was fir&s;t to be pulled out of the foot, and that the Expedition of <HI>Buda</HI> was to be re&s;erv'd for the pre&s;ent year, as was done. In the mean time there were &s;everal Councils of War, wherein the Sentiments of the Generals were very much divided; the mo&s;t part affirming, That it was fir&s;t requi&s;ite to be Ma&s;ters of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> to prevent the Turks from ma|king u&s;e of it as a place of Retreat, and &s;heltering their Army under the Cannon of that Fortre&s;s, as the Sera&s;|quier had done at the la&s;t Siege, to the great vexation of our Forces. Others were for marching directly to the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> taking that City, and then lea|ving a part of the Army for the pre&s;ervation of that important Pa&s;&s;age; to wa&s;t all the Enemies Country, and &s;o to &s;it down before <HI>Buda.</HI> Others were for the
<PB N="6" REF="6">Recovery of <HI>Agria,</HI> and the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Mongats,</HI> there|by to exterminate the Remainder of that Arch-Rebel <HI>Teckely</HI>'s adherents; of which, the Reduction of tho&s;e two places would clear all the <HI>&V;pper Hungary.</HI> Some propos'd to act with two Armies apart: That the Ele|ctor of <HI>Bavaria</HI> &s;hould march into the <HI>&V;pper Hungary,</HI> and draw one part of the Enemies Forces that way, while the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> Be&s;ieg'd <HI>Alba Regalis;</HI> and that the <HI>Croatian</HI> Army under General <HI>Schultz</HI> &s;hould march toward the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck.</HI> There were very few that concluded po&s;itively for the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> which was neverthele&s;s the Enterprize that the Emperor and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had re&s;olv'd to put in Execu|tion whatever it co&s;t 'em, that they might have the re&s;t of <HI>Hungary</HI> at a cheaper rate, keep a door open to <HI>Bel|grade,</HI> and Winter fifty or &s;ixty thou&s;and <HI>Germans,</HI> in the Kingdom, where the year before they could not Winter above twenty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>This De&s;ign thus concluded upon, was kept very &s;e|cret, even from the Generals them&s;elves, to whom the Emperour upon their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion declar'd, that he would &s;end his Re&s;olution what he would have done to the general Rendezvous, which was appointed to be in the Plains of <HI>Barkan,</HI> upon the thirtieth of <HI>May.</HI> But be|cau&s;e the Auxiliary Forces of <HI>Bavaria, Brandenburgh, Saxony,</HI> and the <HI>Circles,</HI> could not be there &s;o &s;oon, they were delay'd for &s;ome days. In the mean time the For|ces march'd from all parts to the place a&s;&s;ign'd, as well by Water as Land; &s;o that it was a lovely &s;ight to &s;ee the <HI>Danube</HI> cover'd with &s;uch an infinite number of Barks and Barges laden with Soldiers, great Guns, Ammuni|tion, and Provi&s;ions, Bullets, Bombs, Granado's, Carca&s;|&s;es, Shovels, Pick-Axes, and other In&s;truments fit for the Siege of a Town.</P>
<P>Upon the 20th. of <HI>May</HI> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> arriv'd at <HI>New&s;tadt,</HI> to which place the whole Court was
<PB N="7" REF="6">come from <HI>Vienna</HI> &s;ome days before. There his E|lectoral Highne&s;s, together with the Arch-Dutche&s;s his La|dy were received by their Imperial Highne&s;&s;es, with all the Marks of a tender Affection, be&s;eeming the near Relati|on between Per&s;onages of that illu&s;trious Quality, the Cannon of the Garri&s;on being three times di&s;charged up|on their Entrance.</P>
<P>Upon the 23d. being A&s;cen&s;ion-Day, the Elector went to vi&s;it the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who was come to <HI>Oldenburgh,</HI> though &s;omewhat indi&s;po&s;ed, and returned the &s;ame E|vening to <HI>New&s;tadt:</HI> Where his Electoral Highne&s;s ha|ving had &s;everal Conferences about the opening of the <HI>Campaign,</HI> and taken leave of their Imperial Maje&s;ties, and the Electre&s;s his Wife, he departed the &s;econd of <HI>June,</HI> with the Acclamations of the whole Court, and People, and the Prayers and good Wi&s;hes of all, That God would be plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve the Life of that young Prince, who was going &s;o generou&s;ly to expo&s;e his own, and the Lives of his Subjects in &s;uch a Holy War, again&s;t the &s;worn Enemy of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>After that his &s;aid Electoral Highne&s;s arriving at <HI>Comor|rha,</HI> was there received by the Commanders, and Magi|&s;trates of the City, with Peals of Cannon, and three Vol|leys of &s;mall Shot, ranged in double Files, and &s;o con|ducted to the Lodging prepared for him. The next day the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who had put him&s;elf at the Head of the Imperial Army, near <HI>Barkan,</HI> came to give a vi|&s;it to his Electoral Highne&s;s, and view the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Ar|my, which was to that purpo&s;e drawn up in Battle-Array in the Fields, near <HI>Comorrha,</HI> where Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Ba|den</HI> commanded next under his Electoral Highne&s;s, in the quality of General of the Cavalry, Count <HI>Serini</HI> in quality of General of Artillery. The Marque&s;s <HI>de la Vergne,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Fontaign,</HI> acted there as Lieutenant-General Mar&s;hals of the Camp; the Count <HI>d'A&s;premont,</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugenius</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> &s;erved as Generals of <HI>Battalia's.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">The Baron of <HI>Beck,</HI> who was al&s;o nominated to &s;erve under his Electoral Highne&s;s, lying &s;ick at <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> of a dangerous Feaver, was di&s;penc'd with; but his Regi|ment of Infantry, which was in the number of tho&s;e which the Emperour had made choice of to re-inforce the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> fail'd not to be there under the Command of the Lieutenant Colonel.</P>
<P>The 10th of <HI>June</HI> Count <HI>Straatman,</HI> great Chancellour to the Emperour, arriv'd at the general Rendezvous near <HI>Barkan,</HI> to compo&s;e certain differences that were ri&s;en a|mong the Generals upon certain Punctilio's of Command, and allotment ordain'd of who and who to &s;erve in the &s;eparate Armies of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> This Mini&s;ter of State, who is one of the mo&s;t dextrous Per&s;ons, and profounde&s;t Politicians of his Age, caus'd a Council of War to be call'd, where he &s;o well manag'd the di&s;po&s;itions of the Generals, that he gave them all the &s;atisfaction imaginable: Which done, he &s;hew'd them the Imperial Commi&s;&s;ion, containing the Emperour's orders to begin the Campagne with the Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> exhorting them withal to behave them&s;elves ac|cording to their Qualities in an Enterprize of &s;uch great importance, upon which depended not only the pre&s;er|vation of his Conque&s;ts, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his Crown Imperial, and the welfare of Chri&s;tendom, but al&s;o the Ruin of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which after the lo&s;s of &s;o con&s;iderable a place could not prevent the other Cities of <HI>Hungary</HI> from returning under the Obedience of their Lawful Sovereign, nor &s;top the progre&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Arms. So that though the Generals expected po&s;itive Or|ders to be&s;iege <HI>Agria,</HI> or <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> it is not to be ex|pre&s;s'd how much overjoy'd they were when they heard that the Emperour was re&s;olv'd they &s;hould &s;it down be|fore <HI>Buda.</HI> And this News being &s;pread among the Of|ficers and Soldiers of both Armies, they te&s;tify'd their particular &s;atisfaction, and the eager de&s;ire which they
<PB N="9" REF="7">had to ha&s;ten to the place where they &s;hould have &s;uch noble opportunities to give &s;ignal proofs of their Valour, and revenge the death of their Comrades, which had laid their bones in the Trenches of the former Siege. The Volunteers, which were already numbred to be above &s;ix thou&s;and that re&s;orted to this Stage of War, from <HI>Germany, Spain, Italy, France, England,</HI> the Low-Coun|tries, and all part of <HI>Europe,</HI> of all Qualities and Con|ditions, to win honour under the Imperial En&s;igns, mani|fe&s;ted the greate&s;t heat and zeal imaginable to &s;ignalize their Courage in &s;o glorious an Enterprize.</P>
<P>The Auxiliaries of <HI>Saxony</HI> commanded by the Prince of <HI>Saxen-Hall,</HI> and Major-General, the Count <HI>de Trautman&s;|dorf,</HI> who had taken their march through <HI>Moravia,</HI> be|ing by this time al&s;o arriv'd at the Rendezvous, the Generals re&s;olv'd to decamp, without &s;taying any longer for the Forces of the Circles, or tho&s;e of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> who having cho&s;en the way of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and the narrow &s;treights of <HI>Jabluncka,</HI> march'd but &s;lowly, and could not arrive &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>Thereupon the Armies di&s;lodg'd the 12th of <HI>June,</HI> be|ing <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> Eve, by break of day: The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> taking the Road that led to the Bridge of <HI>Gran,</HI> which his Army pa&s;s'd the 13th. The Troops of <HI>Saxony</HI> keeping the Van. The Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> held his march on this &s;ide the <HI>Danaw,</HI> that he might make him&s;elf Ma|&s;ter of the City of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> before he &s;ate down before <HI>Buda.</HI> While the two Armies march'd thus on both &s;ides the <HI>Danaw,</HI> the Count of <HI>Rabata,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary-General, caus'd a prodigious number of Gabions and Bavins to be em|bark'd, for making of which the Soldiers were &s;till em|ploy'd, as they came to their Rendezvous, to keep 'em from idlene&s;s, which were all &s;ent with the great Guns, Ammunition, Provi&s;ion, Hay, and other nece&s;&s;ary Provi|&s;ions for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Armies.</P>
<P>The 14th. The Body of the main Army advanc'd &s;o far as till they came under <HI>Vicegrad,</HI> but the &s;maller Artillery,
<PB N="10" REF="8">and the Reer-guard were con&s;train'd to &s;tay behind by rea&s;on of the narrow ways through which they were to pa&s;s. The <HI>Bavarian</HI> Army quarter'd that night near <HI>Vaccia,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danaw.</HI></P>
<P>The 15th. The Imperial Cavalry continu'd their march for an hour beyond <HI>Vicegrad,</HI> followed by the Infantry, and Artillery. And then it was that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent out a commanded Party to di&s;cover the Enemy, who met with a &s;mall Party of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that pre&s;ently betook them&s;elves to flight; but ours had the good for|tune to overtake 'em, and after they had kill'd &s;ome, to make five Pri&s;oners, whom they brought to our Camp. Where being examin'd, they unanimou&s;ly declar'd, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Agria</HI> and <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> fearing a Siege, had &s;ecur'd the be&s;t of their Goods in the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> which together with both the other places were provi|ded both with Men, and all things nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;tain a long Siege, till Relief came.</P>
<P>The 16th. They came within an hours march of <HI>Buda,</HI> none of the Troops of the Garri&s;on appearing all this while to ob&s;erve our countenances.</P>
<P>The 17th. The Cavalry made a halt to re&s;t them&s;elves, and to give the Infantry and the Artillery time to come up. At what time the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> commanded three thou&s;and Men to make &s;ome thou&s;ands of Gabions and Bavins, and began to lay a Bridge of Boats over the Ri|ver, to the I&s;land of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> thereby to joyn together both &s;ides of the <HI>Danaw.</HI></P>
<P>The 18th. The Baron of <HI>Diependael,</HI> General of Batta|lia, inve&s;ted the City of <HI>Buda</HI> with one part of the Ca|valry, while the Infantry came up and took their Po&s;ts about half a League from the place; and then they be|gan the Lines of Circumvallation. At what time a great Party of the Garri&s;on, both Hor&s;e and Foot, &s;hew'd them&s;elves without <HI>Vienna</HI> Gate. But they retreated in|to the City, upon the approach of a detachment of the Imperial Cavalry, which was commanded to charge 'em.
<PB N="11" REF="8">But then the be&s;ieged be&s;towed upon us eight Peals of their Cannon, though without doing any more hurt than only killing one &s;ingle Pioneer, by rea&s;on they &s;hot at too great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The 19th. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> caus'd the Army to advance as far as the hot Baths, of which he made him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter, without any oppo&s;ition, (the <HI>Turks</HI> having a|bandon'd that Po&s;t the day before) and took up his Head Quarters about a quarter of a League from the place. The &s;ame day the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> made him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the City of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> had for|&s;aken, after they had carry'd off their Cannon, Ammuni|tion and Provi&s;ions into <HI>Buda,</HI> and broken down part of the Bridge of Communication between the one place and the other. About the &s;ame time our <HI>Croats</HI> &s;couting up and down met a Turki&s;h <HI>Chaous</HI> with a Convoy of forty Spahi's, who carry'd Letters from the Port to the Grand Vi&s;ier of <HI>Buda:</HI> Him they brought Pri&s;oner to the Camp, where his Letters were read, containing only &s;trict Or|ders to the Vi&s;ier, to be watchful over the Security of the Places that depended upon his Government, and to a&s;&s;ure him of &s;peedy and powerful &s;uccour, in ca&s;e of an At|tack.</P>
<P>The 20th. The Bridg over the <HI>Danaw</HI> was fini&s;hed. Some of the Enemies Cavalry al&s;o the &s;ame Day &s;allied out of the Town, with a de&s;ign to cut off our <HI>Advancd Guards;</HI> but his Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having timely notice thereof, &s;ent 4 Squadrons of Hor&s;e to repel 'em; with whom joined al&s;o &s;everal Volunteers; upon who&s;e approach the Enemy retreated, not daring to en|gage. The &s;ame Day the Artillery arrived in the Camp, and two Batteries were begun to be rai&s;ed again&s;t the low|er Town, which was the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Attack, the Count of <HI>Starenbergh</HI> doing the duty of the Day, as Camp-Mar&s;hal-General. That Evening the Trenches were open|ed; and a <HI>Jani&s;ary</HI> &s;urren dring him&s;elf to our Camp, report|ed as the other Pri&s;oners had done before, that there
<PB N="12" REF="9">were not above eight Thou&s;and Souldiers in the Garri|&s;on; for that the Vizier had &s;ent &s;ome few days before a Reinforcement of two Thou&s;and Men to <HI>Agria,</HI> and an equal number to <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> never dreamt that the Imperiali&s;ts had determined a &s;econd Siege of <HI>Buda,</HI> which had proved &s;o fatal to 'em but two Years ago.

Moreover, that the Vizier <HI>Abdi Ba&s;&s;a</HI> was no great Soldier, fitter to make a Merchant of, than a Governour, and con&s;e|quently de&s;pi&s;ed by the Soldiers. That he had a&s;&s;embled in the public Piazza of the City, all the Captains and Soldiers, and had there with a &s;tudied Harangue, ex|horted 'em to behave them&s;elves according to their Du|ties, and gloriou&s;ly to maintain the honour of the <HI>Tur|bant;</HI> adding withal, that he had Orders from the Grand Signior, to defend the Place to the la&s;t dorp of his Blood; which he was re&s;olved to do, hoping that they would do the like in Expectation of that Relief, which the Grand Signior would infallibly &s;end them. To whom the Jani|&s;aries, and Spahi's replied, that they were ready to &s;acri|fice their Lives in the Service of his Highne&s;s and defence of their Law, upon Condition neverthele&s;s, that the Grand <HI>Vizier</HI> would pay them down upon the Nail, ten Crowns a Head; that he would &s;et at Liberty the Offi|cers and Souldiers detained in the Pri&s;ons, whatever their Crimes might be; and that the Vizier would not hold out to the la&s;t Extremity, le&s;t the &s;ame Misfortune &s;hould befal them, as befel the Garri&s;on of <HI>New-hau&s;el:</HI> all which Conditions the Vizier promi&s;ed exactly to per|form.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t. The Trenches were relieved, upon the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Attack, by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fonck,</HI> Lieutenant Co|lonel of the Regiment of <HI>Souches.</HI> And the &s;ame day, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> having left a &s;ufficient &s;trength in <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge of Boats, to St. <HI>Andrew's</HI> I|&s;land,

The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent all the Imperial and <HI>Bavarian</HI> Cavalry, under the Command of General <HI>Pal&s;i, Gondola,</HI> and others, to Quarter about <HI>Alba Rega|lis,</HI> to con&s;ume the Forrage in tho&s;e Places, and keep that Garri&s;on in continual Alarm, re&s;erving in his Camp no more than a Thou&s;and <HI>Bavarian,</HI> and three Thou&s;and Im|perial Hor&s;e, to &s;ecure the Pioneers. That Night we brought to Perfection a Battery again&s;t the low Town, upon which were planted twelve Pieces of Cannon, which played all that Day, without cea&s;ing: We had five Men Killed, and &s;ome Wounded.</P>
<P>The 23d. By Break of day, we continued Firing with &s;uch good Succe&s;s, that there was a Breach made in the Wall of the Low Town, about twenty Paces broad. All this while the <HI>Bavarians</HI> wrought hard in making their Approaches, of whom there were &s;ome al&s;o Killed and Wounded.</P>
<P>The 24th. The Breach being enlarged, they gave an A&s;&s;ault toward Evening, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Wall, without much re&s;i&s;tance, for that they who were to have defended it, were retired into the High Town, after they had fired only once. In this on|&s;et we had a Captain of Foot, a Lieutenant of Granadeers, four Soldiers, and &s;ix Volunteers Killed, and &s;even or eight Wounded. And from this time forward, they began to attack the City, according to the due forms of Art;
<PB N="14" REF="10">and a re&s;olution was taken, that the Trenches &s;hould e|very day be relieved by a Serjeant General of Battalia, as well upon the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Side, as that of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI>'s: and &s;o upon the 25th. The Count of <HI>Souches,</HI> Lieutenant Camp-Mar&s;hal General, and <HI>Diepen|dael,</HI> General of Battalia, relieved the Trenches: at what time, little el&s;e was done, but only they &s;ecured their Lodg|ing upon the Wall of the Low Town, and re-open'd a Gate, which the <HI>Turks</HI> had clo&s;ed up to the Right hand, at a good di&s;tance from the Breach, where they had taken their Po&s;t; and to the end the Pioneers might work more &s;afely, the Count <HI>de Souches</HI> cau&s;ed &s;ome adjoining Hou&s;es to be fi|red where &s;ome <HI>Fu&s;eleer Turks</HI> were burnt. The &s;ame day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> fini&s;hed a &s;mall Battery upon St. <HI>Gerards Mount,</HI> which the Enemy had abandoned, from whence they &s;hot &s;ome &s;mall Bombs into the High Town, to try the Effect. They al&s;o fini&s;hed another great Battery to beat down the great Roundel that joins the Ca&s;tle to the High Town. The &s;ame day Count <HI>Budiani</HI> pre&s;ented to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ome Colours, which he had won from a Party of <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Cavalry, which convoyed about fourteen or fif|teen Barks, laden with Women and Children, belonging to the Officers of <HI>Buda,</HI> who were endeavouring to make their E&s;cape, with all the wealth of the City, to <HI>Belgrade;</HI> and whom his <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> and <HI>Heydukes,</HI> reinforced with a Par|ty of Imperial Dragoons, had &s;urprized and routed near St. <HI>Margarets</HI> I&s;land, got a rich Booty, and taken Ninety two Women and Children, and among the re&s;t, the Vi|zier of <HI>Buda</HI>'s Wife.</P>
<P>The 26th. They wrought upon &s;everal traver&s;e Lines, and to fini&s;h the Approaches, to &s;ecure our Lodgments in the Low Town, which were furni&s;hed with two Thou|&s;and Soldiers, and a good number of Pioneers, who met with great difficulty to advance their Works, the Ground being very rugged, and Stony. The &s;ame day the Grand Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Teutonic</HI> Order, perceiving that our Workmen in the Low Town might be ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ailed and
<PB N="15" REF="10">beaten by the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;ent to Count <HI>Starenbergh</HI> Camp-Mar|&s;hal General for &s;ome Infantry, who thereupon &s;ent him &s;ix Battalions, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Starenbergh, Newbourg, Mansfield, Souches, Diependael,</HI> and <HI>Tungen,</HI> who were po&s;ted along the Wall, to &s;ecure the Workmen. The &s;ame day al&s;o two De&s;erters, who pretended them&s;elves to be <HI>Hungari|ans,</HI> &s;urrendred them&s;elves, and confirmed what had been &s;aid before, that the Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of no more than eight Thou&s;and fighting Men, and that by the order of the <HI>Vi&s;ier Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> they had begun to take away the Roofs of the Hou&s;es, and to unpave the Streets, on purpo&s;e to prevent the Effects of the Bombs. Toward Evening, between &s;ix and &s;even a Clock, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;allied forth, making hideous outcries, on purpo&s;e to &s;care tho&s;e that were po&s;ted near the Roundel, toward the Water-&s;ide; but they were &s;o well received, that they retired in great Con|fu&s;ion. For Camp-Mar&s;hal General <HI>Starenbergh</HI> came timely in with two Battalions of tho&s;e Men that had been po&s;ted the day before, behind the Wall; which had he not done, the Enemy without doubt had made a great Slaughter of our Pioneers. The Enemy was pur&s;ued about two Hun|dred Paces from the Trenches, and our Soldiers brought off &s;everal of the Heads of the <HI>Turks,</HI> which they pre&s;ent|ed to his Highen&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who cau&s;ed a Ducket in Gold to be given to each Soldier, for every Head. Captain <HI>Burger</HI> of <HI>Starenbergh's</HI> Regiment was there wounded, with ten or twelve Soldiers, and as many &s;lain outright.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> fini&s;hed two Batteries for Bombs, on each &s;ide their Grand Battery. They al&s;o carryed on their Trenches above a Hundred Paces, they al&s;o made three cro&s;s Lines, and a Place for drawing up the Soldiers for the Guard of their Battery. The <HI>Turks</HI> al&s;o fired very furiou&s;ly upon us with their great Guns, but did us no more Mi&s;chief, than only to kill us two Men.</P>
<P>The 27th. Fini&s;hed the Works which they had begun
<PB N="16" REF="11">in the Night; they made new Traver&s;es; &s;ome Mu&s;que|teers were put into the Mo&s;que of the Low Town; a Po&s;t was taken upon the Right hand, near the Gate which makes the Angle of the High Town; they enlarged and deepened their Lines, to render 'em capable of holding more Men; and almo&s;t fini&s;hed the Grand Battery, with|out any Lo&s;s, &s;aving one Man Killed, and &s;ome Wound|ed. That Morning the Enemy &s;hewed them&s;elves in the &s;ame Part as the day before, ranged as if they had de|&s;igned &s;ome Encounter, but perceiving we were ready to receive them, they retired within the Circuit of their Walls, without enterprizing any thing. About eleven a Clock at Noon, they &s;allied out Hor&s;e and Foot to di&s;lodge our Men that were po&s;ted on the Right hand; but having di&s;charged one &s;ingle Volley, and perceiving the Count of <HI>Hoffkirken, Dunewald</HI>'s Lieutenant Collonel, ha&s;tning to the relief of ours, with the Hor&s;e-guard, they regain'd the Ci|ty, leaving twenty of their Men dead upon the Spot, be|&s;ides the Wounded, which they carried along with them. Of ours, there were but two killed, and five or fix wound|ed. The &s;ame day came another De&s;erter, who reported that the Governour was very much perplexed, fore&s;eeing the inevitable lo&s;s of the City, which the Grand Signior had committed to his Charge; as al&s;o for that in his Sal|leys, he lo&s;t the be&s;t and choice&s;t of his Men, without any hopes of ruining our Works; but that nothing griev'd him &s;o much to the Heart, as the taking of his own, and the Wives of the principal Officers of the Garri&s;on, by the <HI>Heydukes, Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> and Dragoons, when they thought they had been in a place of &s;afety. The &s;ame day al&s;o fini&s;hed a Battery on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, levelled again&s;t the Ca&s;tle and the Rondel next the City.</P>
<P>They 29th. They drew a Line of Communication four Hundred Paces in length from the Po&s;t of the Right hand Angle, to the middle Gate, and another Line were made to go to the middle Battery, upon which was Planted twelve Pieces of Cannon. They al&s;o wrought to

<P>The 30. The Forces of <HI>Suabia</HI> and <HI>Franconia</HI> arrived in the Camp, and took the Po&s;ts which had been a&s;&s;igned them.

The Count of <HI>Souches,</HI> who commanded this day in the Trenches, having &s;ent three Granadeers to ob|&s;erve the Di&s;tance between our Approaches and the Roundel, brought word that it was not above three hundred Paces, and that the Enemy was hard at work in making a deep Trench at the Foot of the Roundel, and that having gone a great way forwarder on the left &s;ide, than on the right, they had encrea&s;ed their number of Workemen on the right &s;ide. All night long, Bavins, Gabions, Munition, and Provi&s;ion, were &s;ent to the Camp in great abundance, through the Care of the Count <HI>de Rabata</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary General.

The &s;ame day they fini&s;hed their Works, and made two Redoubts to &s;ecure a Communication with the great Battery. This Night we had but five wounded and one &s;lain; but in the morning Adjutant General <HI>Mercy</HI> was wounded in the Head with a Musket as he was carrying Orders to the Approaches. There was nothing done in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter this day, only they advanced their Works, and their Batteries had made a Breach in the Rampart without: And the &s;ame day the remainder of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Forces arrived, con&s;i&s;ting of 1400 Foot, which were added to the re&s;t of the &s;ame Circle.</P>

The &s;ame day the Troops of <HI>Suabia</HI> began their Line of Circumval|lation, and the next night rai&s;ed a Battery upon the Hill which they po&s;&s;e&s;s.

The &s;ame day the Imperiali&s;ts fini&s;h'd another Line for the defence of their Trenches. They al&s;o fired very furiou&s;ly with their Can|non and Mortar Pieces; &s;o that they not only made a con&s;idera|ble Breach in the Wall, but al&s;o ruin'd the Batteries upon the two fir&s;t Roundels, from whence the Enemy fired without Intermi&s;|&s;ion. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> advanced their Lines to the Ca&s;tle, and rai&s;ed a new Battery on the right hand toward the <HI>Danaw,</HI> upon which they planted nine Mortar Pieces, which did wonderful Execution. Three days before this, they play'd from a Battery of &s;even Demi-Cannons again&s;t the round Tower, while from another of four Pieces they belabour'd the Flanks: they like|wi&s;e rai&s;ed a new Battery of eight Pieces to beat down the left &s;ide of the Roundel. Seven men were kill'd in the Lorrain Attack, and &s;ome wounded. This day in the Afternoon, an En&s;ign of the Jani&s;aries rendred him&s;elf to the Camp, having de&s;erted his own Party for having kill'd a Turki&s;h Officer in a Duel. He a&s;&s;ured us that of true Jani&s;aries, there were not above fifteen hundred in the Garri&s;on; but that what with the <HI>Saphi</HI>'s, <HI>Albanians,</HI> and others, they made up the number of &s;even thou&s;and fighting Men. He ad|ded, that the Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es had already ruined &s;everal Edi|fices, and occa&s;ioned great de&s;truction both of Men and Cattel. That the Be&s;ieged were very bu&s;ie in making a Mine behind the Breach of the Lorrain Attack; and that till that very hour, there had not any per&s;on entred the place. As for General <HI>Dunewald,</HI> he forbore to pro&s;ecute his De&s;ign upon <HI>Palotta,</HI> finding it was provided with a good Garri&s;on; a Party of which had kill'd &s;ome of his Men that went to take a view of the place. Another Par|ry al&s;o of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> had met withal, and routed &s;ome Forragers of the Hor&s;e that were quartered in the Neighbourhood, and kill'd among others Count <HI>Papenheim,</HI> Captain of Hor&s;e in the Bavarian Troops.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="13">
<P><HI>July</HI> 4. They advanced &s;o far with their Approaches in the Lorrain Attack, that they were got within a hundred Paces of the Breach of the Roundel on the right hand. The Enemy al&s;o began to make a Line without the Breach about fifty Paces from our Works, to render the Breach more inacce&s;&s;ible; and though they fired continually all night long with their Mu&s;quets, and &s;lung an infinite number of Stones, we had but thirteen men kill'd and wounded. And now had we fourteen Mortar Pieces planted that &s;hot Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es continually without cea&s;ing. In the Ba|varian Attack, but only what concern'd the &s;ecuring our Works, and advancing the Batteries. This morning a Polonian that &s;erv'd the Turks, render'd him&s;elf to the Camp, and reported that the be&s;ieged were re&s;olv'd to Surrender, if they were not reliev'd within a Month: and another De&s;erter in the afternoon came and declared that the be&s;ieged had the night before landed five Hor&s;e|men a&s;hore on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide, who were to take &s;everal Roads, that one at lea&s;t might get &s;afe to the <HI>Sera&s;quier,</HI> and pre&s;s him to ha&s;ten the Relief that he had promis'd. On the other &s;ide the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent a Detachment of Hor&s;e toward <HI>Voitfar,</HI> to de&s;troy the Gra&s;s and Corn, and watch the Motion of the Enemy. Of this &s;ome Tartars had Intelligence, and &s;napt &s;ome of our Forragers on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Danaw;</HI> they al&s;o took &s;ome Hor&s;es, and two Grooms belonging to Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> who were in St. <HI>Marget</HI>'s I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 5. La&s;t night &s;ixty Granadeers, with &s;ome Pioneers, were commanded to go and ruin the Line which the Enemy had the day before begun before the breach of the Roundel, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that they filled up the breach without the lo&s;s of more than two Soldiers. By this time al&s;o the breaches were made wider and wider, as well where the Lorrainers, as where the Bavarians attacked, and what the Turks repaired in the night, was by us overthrown in the day time. And now all the Bavarians were come up and joyned together in their Quarters; upon whom the Enemy made a Sally in the night time; and though they were bravely received, and purfued to the very Gates of the City, yet they lo&s;t many gallant and &s;tout Men, and among the re&s;t the Son of Camp-Mar&s;hal-General <HI>Dorfeling,</HI> an Ingineer, two Lieutenants, and &s;even and twenty Soldiers, be&s;ides the &s;ame num|ber wounded.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 6. There was a Line of Communication made from the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Attack to that of the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> not above
<PB N="22" REF="14">fifty Paces from the Gate in the middle and about &s;ixty Paces from the breach on the right hand. This morning the Cannon played &s;o furiou&s;ly, that they utterly beat down the two Roundels with the Curtain; and when night came they &s;hot without cea&s;ing Bombs and Granadoes, that kindled a fire near the Roundel, on the right hand, that la&s;ted three hours. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and General <HI>Starenbergh</HI> &s;tay'd till eleven of Clock at night in the Approaches, to encourage the Workmen with their pre&s;ence. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> al&s;o had by this time vigorou&s;ly advanced their Works, their Generals of Battalia alternatively relieving one ano|ther in their Trenches. The Sieur <HI>Fonk,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Souches,</HI> was wounded in the Leg, with &s;ix Soldiers, and two killed. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> had a Captain of Granadeers wounded, with &s;ix Soldiers, and eight &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 7. La&s;t night a great number of Bombs were &s;hot into the Town, which did great Execution, in regard the fire was &s;een to blaze out in &s;everal parts of the City; though greater Execution was expected to be done upon the Arrival of <HI>Gonzales</HI> our Ingi|neer, who was lookt for in the Camp within two or three days, whither the great Guns, Mortar Pieces, Bombs, Carca&s;&s;es, and other Artificial Fire-works were already arrived. This morning the Enemy &s;allied out upon the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Attack with Hor&s;e and Foot, but greatly to their di&s;advantage; being &s;o vigorou&s;ly receiv'd, that they were forced to retire in great di&s;order, being pur&s;ued under the very Walls of the City: there were al&s;o prepa|ring their Batteries to be ready in two days, when they re&s;olved to be heard as loud as the re&s;t of their Friends. Ye&s;terday the Miners began to work upon the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack to widen the breaches, and this night the &s;ame was done upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> At|tack, where they had by this fini&s;h'd two new Batteries, the one of ten, the other of &s;even Pieces of Cannon; and a third was rai&s;ing toward the water &s;ide, to level the attacked Roundel, and a gate through which the be&s;ieged &s;allied out very frequently to get into a clo&s;e way which they had made before the &s;aid Roun|del. Ye&s;terday the <HI>Bavarians</HI> advanc'd their Approaches to the foot of the Ca&s;tle, &s;o that they could approach no nearer till the breach were enlarged. And indeed the Works in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> At|tack were &s;o near the Wall, that they could not advance any nearer without lodging upon the breach. So that there were above fifty men killed and wounded in the three Attacks. Ye&s;ter night the Enemy &s;hot a Bomb, which lighting into a barrel of Powder, kill'd nine of our Cannoneers.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="14">
<P>The 8th was bu&s;ily employ'd upon the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, in rai&s;|ing nearer the Walls two new Batteries of three Demi-Cannons each; and upon the left hand, where we had not carried on our Approaches as upon the left, they advanced their Approaches to the very Wall of the Roundel; which being a work to be done &s;o near the Enemy, co&s;t us five and twenty Soldiers, kill'd and wounded, the mo&s;t part with Stones and Granadoes, among whom was Major General <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ngen,</HI> who was upon the Guard of the Trenches with the Count <HI>de Souches.</HI> The Sieur <HI>Bi&s;choffhan&s;en</HI> Serjcant Major of one of the <HI>Suabian</HI> Regiments, had his Arm broken with a Musket &s;hot; one of <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s Captains was wounded in the &s;houlder, and <HI>Souches</HI>'s Captain Lieutenant in the Foot. As for the Miners that were ordered to &s;app under the right &s;ide of the <HI>Roundel,</HI> had not as yet met with any Mines of the E|nemy. This evening others were &s;et to work upon the left &s;ide of the middle Roundel: and this night Captain <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rger</HI> of <HI>Staren|bergh</HI>'s Regiment, who had been wounded in the Mouth in the Salley upon the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> died of his wound. Some Country|men having found a means to make their E&s;capes out of the City, came the &s;ame night to our Camp, and a&s;&s;ured us that there were not above three hundred men that laboured con&s;tantly in the Mines and the Retrenchment which the Enemies were making behind the Wall, whither to retire in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 9. All night long there was nothing done but &s;hooting of Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es into the City, to keep the be&s;ieged in Action, and to deprive them of their Repo&s;e. But by break of day the Enemy perceiving that we had made a Gallery of Planks to pa&s;s the Miners over to the middle Roundel, rowl'd down &s;everal Bombs, threw Granadoes, and other Fire-works, with all &s;orts of combu&s;tible Materials in &s;uch abundance, that the fire caught hold of the Planks, and reduced the Gallery to A&s;hes, which obliged our Miners to come away, and de&s;i&s;t from their work till the next night. This morning about five a clock the Enemy &s;prung a Mine &s;ome Paces without the Wall, between the middle Roundel and that of the Gate, which &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that it overthrew one of our Mines, where we had &s;even or eight of our Miners, &s;ome kill'd and &s;ome wounded. After that they made a Salley, put our Pioneers into di&s;order, de&s;troy'd &s;ome of our Works, and po&s;ted them&s;elves between the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers.</HI> But the Re&s;erve flying thither from the Main-guard, con&s;trained the Enemy, after a &s;harp Encounter of half an hour, to regain
<PB N="24" REF="15">the City. We had forty of ours kill'd and wounded, and the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> had few le&s;s, among whom was one of their be&s;t Cannoneers, and &s;ome Inferiour Officers. The Enemy left behind them above four&s;core &s;lain, be&s;ides what were wounded. But notwith&s;tanding this rude check to their Succe&s;s, the be&s;iegers went on with the &s;ame vigour as before with their Approaches, their Lines and their Galleries. And the <HI>Bavarians</HI> ye&s;terday ruin'd the little Gate near the Roundel, with a Battery of ten Pieces of Demy-Cannon, &s;o that the breach was already become very broad.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the 10th, In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack the men labour'd all night to repair the Batteries and Approaches ruin'd by the Salley which the Enemy made the day before, and to rebuild the Gallery which they had burn'd, &s;o that they de&s;ign'd to put the Miners to work that evening. On the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide the Miners were &s;et to work under the Pali&s;ado of the Roundel, and under the Wall, in hopes that the Mines would be ready to &s;pring in three days. We had Soldiers kill'd and wounded, among whom tho&s;e of chiefe&s;t note were Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Wachtenheim,</HI> who com|manded in one of the <HI>Suabian</HI> Regiments. At the &s;ame time we had Intelligence by our Spies that the Turks, to the number of &s;even thou&s;and, re-inforced by the Tartars that ramble about the Country, had a de&s;ign to put a new Governour into <HI>Buda,</HI> with a Supply of Men; which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to com|mand &s;ome Infantry to po&s;t them&s;elves on the other &s;ide the <HI>Da|naw,</HI> and joyn in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity with the Cavalry which lay there, and to meet and fight the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 11. This night five Demi-Cannon were planted upon the new Batteries in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, and two Mortar Pieces upon a little Fort adjoyning, with the lo&s;s only of two Soldiers &s;lain, and five wounded. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> planted three Pieces upon a Battery, and the next night they planted a greater number to &s;hoot red hot Bullets into the City. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ecured their Works with two Redoubts. Ye&s;terday in the evening four hun|dred commanded Foot were &s;ent upon <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide to rai&s;e &s;ome De|&s;ences upon the <HI>Danaw</HI> to prevent the putting of any Relief into <HI>Buda.</HI> And now the Command of Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Souches</HI> being vacant by the death of the Sieur <HI>Fonck,</HI> who dy'd ye&s;ter|day of his wound in the Leg, it was conferred upon the Count of <HI>Herler&s;tein,</HI> Serjeant Major to <HI>La Vergne.</HI></P>
<P>The 12. All the Batteries were fini&s;hed, as well in the <HI>Lorrain</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="15">Attack, as in that of the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> and the fir&s;t Lines of the&s;e two Attacks were joyned in &s;uch a manner, that the men might pa&s;s from the one to the other &s;ecure from the Shot of the Enemy. For being &s;o near the Wall as they were, the Be&s;ieged did nothing but throw Granado's, and &s;ling Stones, to di&s;turb the Workmen: But being thus &s;ecured, the damage they did us was incon&s;iderable. The Miners in the Mine on the Lefthand, were already far advanced under the Wall: But in that upon the Right-hand they met with more difficulty, and therefore they re&s;olved to widen the Breach with their Cannon. La&s;t Night the Count <HI>de Souches,</HI> who commanded in the Trenches, cau&s;ed the Breach to be viewed by the Orders of Count <HI>Starenbergh,</HI> and it was found wide enough to make an A&s;&s;ault. The <HI>Brandenburgh|ers</HI> al&s;o this day began to &s;hoot red-hot Bullets and Bombs into the City, with twenty two Cannons and two Mortar-Pieces; but they did no great Execution, in regard the Be&s;ieged had taken away all the Rafters of their Hou&s;es. And yet the Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es invented by the Franci&s;can Fryer, and the Spani&s;h En|gineer, may be &s;aid to work Wonders. Neverthele&s;s the main bu&s;ine&s;s of this day was to widen and level the Breaches; and we had this day nine wounded and three killed, by the Granado's and Stones. As for the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> the Breach which they had made in the great Roundel was by this time wide enough, and the Miners were at work under the Pali&s;ado of the Trench. Ye|&s;terday the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having Intelligence that the Sera&s;|quier was advanced with &s;ome thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> as far as <HI>Hatwan,</HI> commanded Three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and &s;ix Battalions of Infan|try, <HI>Imperiali&s;ts, Bavarians,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> under the Con|duct of General Baron <HI>de Mercy,</HI> to pa&s;s the <HI>Danaw,</HI> and po&s;t them&s;elves on the other &s;ide of the Bridge, to prevent the Enemy from putting any Relief into the Town, with a new Governor, called <HI>Achmet Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> reputed one of the be&s;t Officers that the <HI>Turk</HI> has in his Service.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 13. This morning the Enemy &s;prung a Mine at the mid|dle Roundel near to ours, that was already fini&s;hed, without &s;o much as the lo&s;s of one Man of our &s;ide: Tho on the other &s;ide it did the Execution which ours ought to have done, and overthrew a part of the Roundel, where as yet we had not made any Breach. There were two hundred <HI>Turks</HI> who were ready to have fallen pell mell into our Works &s;o &s;oon as the Mine was &s;prung; but finding it had done an Execution quite contrary to
<PB N="26" REF="16">what they expected, they retir'd. And now all things being in a Readine&s;s for an A&s;&s;ault, to the end they might po&s;t them&s;elves upon the Wall; Count <HI>Starenbergh</HI> directed the Attack in the following manner. Count <HI>Guido Starenbergh,</HI> Lieutenant Collo|nel to the Regiment of that Name, was commanded upon the right hand again&s;t the Roundel: Count <HI>de Herber&s;teen,</HI> Serjeant Major to <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI> was in the middle of the Curtin, and the Count <HI>d' Aver&s;pergh</HI> Lieutenant Collonel to <HI>Mansfield</HI> had the left hand. They had each two hundred and eighty Soldiers: The Engineers, Granadeers, Fu&s;eleers, Carpenters, and Pioneers, were po&s;ted between them and the re&s;t, to the number of two thou&s;and men were divided into three Bodies of Re&s;erve, to &s;up|port and relieve the A&s;&s;ailants. The Volunteers, who had re|que&s;ted that Station, intermixed them&s;elves among the fir&s;t. Be|tween &s;even and eight of the Clock in the Evening the Signal was given to mount the Breaches, with a Peal from all the Bat|teries, and a &s;howre of Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es that were &s;hot again&s;t the City and the Retrenchments of the Enemy behind the breach. Nor could all the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Enemy prevent our men from mounting, where the combat was very ob&s;tinate on both &s;ides, and maintained for the &s;pace of three quarters of an Hour with all the bravery imaginable: At what time the Enemy al&s;o &s;prang a Mine under our fir&s;t Line, which buried Captain <HI>Kalkreiter</HI> of <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s Regiment, and &s;ome Soldiers. But at length, finding we could not get footing for want of Ground, that we could not force the Palli&s;ado'd Retrenchment of the Be&s;ieged behind the Breach, and that our chief Officers were al|ready all either wounded or killed by the continual firing of the Enemy, it was thought convenient to cau&s;e the A&s;&s;ailants to re|treat, who had fought like Lions, and of which five were &s;o va|liant as to throw them&s;elves into the Retrenchment, and yet to bring them&s;elves off and retire with the re&s;t; who, had they been but duly &s;uccoured, perhaps there would have needed no farther work to have lodged upon the Breach. However the Retreat was made in good Order. The Regiments of <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Mansfield</HI> &s;uffered mo&s;t in this Action; and <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s al&s;o was very much damnified. There were about four hundred killed and wounded: but that which was more particularly to be de|plored, was the lo&s;s of &s;o many brave Officers and Volunteers. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Camp-Mar&s;hal-General <HI>Starenbergh</HI> were pre&s;ent at this Action, giving Orders every where as occa|&s;ion
<PB N="27" REF="16">required. Few of the wounded e&s;caped, which is the Rea|&s;on &s;ome believe the Turks do &s;hoot with poy&s;on'd Bullets. A|mong the dead were the Count <HI>de Herber&s;tein</HI> Serjeant Major to <HI>Scherffenbergh,</HI> the Count of <HI>Kuff&s;tein,</HI> a Captain to <HI>Starembergh,</HI> with another Captain of the &s;ame Regiment. The Baron of <HI>Rolle,</HI> the <HI>Sieur Kirchmeyer,</HI> one of <HI>Souches</HI>'s Captains; and two of <HI>Mansfield</HI>'s Captains, with eight En&s;igns and Lieutenants of Infantry. Of the Volunteers that were &s;lain or died of their Wounds, the chief were the Duke of <HI>Vejar,</HI> Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI> who behaved him&s;elf with &s;o much Courage that he was one of the fir&s;t upon the Breach. Prince <HI>Robert</HI>'s Son, with another Engli&s;h Lord, the Baron of <HI>Scheyffer,</HI> the Son of the Count of <HI>Maldegem,</HI> the young Count of <HI>Courmaillon,</HI> a Count of <HI>Donaw,</HI> and &s;even or eight other Per&s;ons of Quality. Among the wound|ed, as well Officers as Volunteers, there was Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Guido de Starenbergh</HI> wounded with the &s;plinter of a Granado in the Shoulder, and a Musket Bullet in the Foot, Lieutenant Col|lonel the Count <HI>d' Aver&s;pergh</HI> in the Foot, but not dangerou&s;ly; and indeed there were few of the re&s;t of the Officers e&s;caped; the Prince of <HI>Veldens,</HI> of the <HI>Palatine</HI> Family, Prince <HI>Picolomine,</HI> two Engli&s;h Lords, the Duke of <HI>E&s;calona,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain;</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Valero,</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Vejar;</HI> the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> and above thirty other Volunteers of Quality. The Spani&s;h and Engli&s;h di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves, and fighting to out|vye one another, endured the main Fury of the Enemy. And indeed the Engli&s;h &s;uffered very much: For of twenty, all Per|&s;ons of Quality, there were not above &s;ix that were not either killed or wounded. The Lo&s;s of the Be&s;ieged was al&s;o very great, for by what we under&s;tood afterwards, they had above two hundred of their chiefe&s;t Men killed and wounded. It was thought the <HI>Bran|denburghers</HI> would have made an Attempt on their &s;ide, but they excu&s;ed them&s;elves, alledging that their Breach was not then wide enough. However the Turks upon the Retreat of our Men, made a little &s;ally upon their Attack; but were repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s of twenty four of their Party. Upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> &s;ide they had made a con&s;iderable Breach in the Roundel, and in the Wall that &s;ecures the Ca&s;tle, which the Be&s;ieged repair'd every Night with Gabions, Pali&s;ado's, and Bavins.</P>
<P>The 14th. All the night and day was &s;pent in burying the dead and repairing the Approaches, in planting more Cannon upon the Batteries, and in carrying on the Mines, the Miners being actually
<PB N="28" REF="17">&s;et to work under Ground on the &s;ide of the great Roundel. Two Galleries were al&s;o built toward the Curtin, between the twelfth and thirteenth Roundel. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> al&s;o having &s;ent for three Regiments of Hor&s;e from near <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> to go and re-inforce General <HI>Mercy,</HI> the Count <HI>de Caprara</HI> detach'd the Re|giments of <HI>Tru&s;ches, Taff,</HI> and <HI>Stirum,</HI> who this morning pa&s;s'd the Bridge on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide. In the evening the be&s;ieged &s;prung a Mine in the <HI>Eavarian</HI> Attack, on the left hand of the Roundel of the Ca&s;tle, which &s;ucceeded very ill. The &s;ame day his Ele|ctoral Highne&s;s having caus'd eight Parapets of thick oaken Planks plaited with Iron, (being a new Invention, found them very pro|per) to be made u&s;e of in A&s;&s;aults and Attacks, every Parapet be|ing &s;ufficient to &s;ecure a hundred armed men. The &s;ame day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> di&s;covered and di&s;appointed five Mines of the Ene|mies.</P>
<P>The 15th. They went on fini&s;hing their Lines, and being to dig under the Wall, they heard the Enemy at work under the breach. This day the Sieur <HI>Gonzales</HI> arriv'd, and &s;hot his Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es into the City, which did great Execution, where five or &s;ix were kill'd and wounded. This day the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ha|ving intelligence that the Convoy of the Enemy which had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Tibi&s;cus</HI> near <HI>Segedin,</HI> lay &s;till encamp'd under the Cannon of the Fortre&s;s of <HI>Hatwan,</HI> his Excellency &s;ent for two Regiments of Hor&s;e more to joyn with General <HI>Mercy,</HI> with a de&s;ign to con|&s;train the Enemy to repa&s;s the River.</P>
<P>On the 16th a new Battery was erected in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack without the Wall of the low Town on the right hand, again&s;t the great Roundel, which was al&s;o battered on the other &s;ide to make the breach the larger. This day a <HI>Ra&s;cian</HI> coming out of the Ci|ty, with a Packet of Letters which the Governor of the place had intru&s;ted him with, to carry to the Governour of <HI>Alba Rega|tis,</HI> rendred him&s;elf in the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Quarters. But in regard the Letters were written in the <HI>Armenian</HI> Language, and for that there was never an Interpreter in the Camp, they &s;ent them to <HI>Vienna</HI> to be deciphered. Some Country People al&s;o making their E&s;cape from the Town, reported that the <HI>Jani|zaries</HI> began to murmur again&s;t the Governour for being &s;o ob&s;ti|nate to let things go to the utmo&s;t extremity; but that by the pu|ni&s;hment of the Mutineers, by means of his Money, and a &s;trong a&s;&s;urance of &s;peedy Succour, he had &s;o well confirm'd the re&s;t in their duty, that they promi&s;ed to hold out to the la&s;t drop of
<PB N="29" REF="17">blood. This evening the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> commanded a hundred and fifty men, &s;econded by a great number, to attack the Pali&s;ado in the Trench at the foot of the Roundel of the Ca|&s;tle, the Lieutenant General the Count of <HI>Fontain,</HI> undertook the Attack on the right hand, and the Count of <HI>A&s;premont</HI> on the left. And this was the fir&s;t time they made u&s;e of three Parapets of Wood, which were very profitable to us; and they attackt that po&s;t &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that they carried it by dint of Sword, and cut to pieces all that were in it; but they &s;old their Lives dear however, for we had there the Count of <HI>Fontain</HI> kill'd, with five and thirty Soldiers and Volunteers. The Count of <HI>A&s;premont</HI> was very much bruis'd in the Head with a Musket-bullet, which &s;trook off his Steel-cap. Baron <HI>Gottalisky</HI> Captain of <HI>Beck</HI>'s Regi|ment, and the Sieur <HI>Vaubon</HI> Captain of the Granadeers of <HI>Baden,</HI> were both dangerou&s;ly wounded, with &s;everal others. However this Po&s;t gave us acce&s;s to the Roundel.</P>
<P>The 17. Ye&s;terday the Enemy began to &s;hoot from a new Bat|tery of four great Pieces which they had rai&s;ed within the inner Wall; but General <HI>Starenbergh,</HI> giving order to the Gunners to play upon it with &s;everal Pieces, they &s;o utterly de&s;troyed that Bat|tery in a &s;hort time, that the be&s;ieged could make no farther u&s;e of it. About noon twenty or thirty <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> &s;hew'd them&s;elves upon the breach of the Roundel on the right hand, but the Soldiers from the Trenches firing upon 'em, they retired immediately. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> arrived in the Camp ye&s;terday in the evening, with Commi&s;&s;ion to be General of the Artillery. This day <HI>Capra|ra</HI>'s and <HI>Newburgh</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e marched to joyn General <HI>Mercy.</HI> As for the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> they did little this day but mind the fini&s;hing of their Works, and fired conti|nually from their Batteries.</P>
<P>The 18. We advanced &s;ome Paces with a new Line to the right, the better to protect our Miners that wrought in two di&s;tinct places under the Curtin, and to make u&s;e of it in the next A&s;&s;ault. The <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> enlarged their great Battery of three Pieces of Cannon. Nor were the <HI>Bavarians</HI> idle, for their Miners were at work under the Wall behind the Pallia&s;ado'd Trench, of which they had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters. As for the Enemy, he &s;eldom now appear'd in the day time; but in the night time they kept &s;iring continually, and kill'd us a great many men, with their Stones and Granadoes, which they flung into our Works.</P>
<P>The 19. The Cannon was planted upon the new Battery, and
<PB N="30" REF="18">the Line was &s;ecured with two little Forts. La&s;t night the Enemy &s;prang a Mine behind our Miners that wrought under the Wall, which damnified our Mine, into which there was a nece&s;&s;ity to make a new Entrance, to make it &s;erviceable again. Some of our Miners were almo&s;t buried in the Earth, but they were all fortu|nately recovered again, except the Sieur <HI>Libert</HI> their Captain, who&s;e Body could not not be found. Mr. <HI>Kerry,</HI> Brother to my Lord <HI>Ouberry,</HI> a Scotch Lord was kill'd in the Approaches with a Musket bullet, together with &s;even or eight Soldiers, and &s;ome wounded. This morning the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> held a Council of War, where were pre&s;ent the Generals of his Army; but the De|termination was kept &s;ecret. Some De&s;erters al&s;o came to the Camp this day, and a&s;&s;ured us that the be&s;ieged would come to no Compo&s;ition, but were re&s;olved to wait the Relief which the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> &s;hould bring them.</P>
<P>The 20. The new Line in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack was fini&s;hed. Three fal&s;e Alarms al&s;o were given to the be&s;ieged only to harra&s;s them, by cau&s;ing certain Granadeers to mount the Breach, who threw Granadoes into the Place, upon which the <HI>Turks</HI> ha&s;tning to make defence, were &s;aluted with &s;everal Cannon-&s;hot, Bombs and Car|ca&s;&s;es that did good Execution. Which &s;ort of Attacks were fre|quently, to keep the Enemy in continual Alarm, and in ignorance of the time of the really de&s;ign'd A&s;&s;ault. Moreover, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">go|rou&s;loy carried on their Mines; a certain <HI>German</HI> undertaking a new one, which he promi&s;ed to fini&s;h in two or three days. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Attacks there was nothing pa&s;s'd con|&s;iderable, only that the Miners hop'd the next night to be under the Roundels. They al&s;o continued battering the Walls with great fury, and &s;hoting red hot Bullets, Bombs, and Carca&s;&s;es into the City, which did very much mi&s;chief. Upon Informati|on given that the <HI>Turks</HI> prepared to relieve the place, the Trench of the Line of Circumvallation was made deeper; and &s;trength|ned with certain Redoubts, the better to &s;ecure the be&s;iegers; to which purpo&s;e two hundred <HI>Heydukes</HI> were added to the number of Pioneers.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 21. The principal Work now carried on was that of the Mines, which were opened in three &s;everal parts. Nor could Captain <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>'s body yet be found, though all diligence has been u&s;ed to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">llow the Earth in that place where his body was by all conjecture lo&s;t. He was an Officer, a <HI>Walloon</HI> by Nation, much lamented by all the Generals, and by all that knew his Experience
<PB N="31" REF="18">in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mining: Our Miners al&s;o heard the Enemy at work, but they went on with their own work for all that. A Battery was likewi&s;e rai&s;ed for four Mortar Pieces, near that of the three Spani&s;h Pieces, which batter the Roundel on the right Hand. Moreover all the Cannons and Mortar Pieces were de|&s;igned to be planted nearer the Breaches, on purpo&s;e to widen them with more ea&s;e, and ruin the Defences of the Enemy, which are behind the &s;aid Breaches: We had in the Lorrain Attack only twenty &s;even killed and wounded, among whom were Ser|jeant Major <HI>Boeneburgh,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Lerneux,</HI> the fifth Captain of <HI>Starenbergh</HI>'s Regiment. The <HI>Sieur Gonzale</HI>'s Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es have had the &s;ucce&s;s which was expected; For by the Report of a De&s;erter, one of tho&s;e Bombs falling ye&s;terday into the City, made its way into a Hou&s;e, into which were retired above a Hundred Per&s;ons of both Sexes, who were all mi&s;erably buried in the Ruins of it. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> fini&s;hed their Battery near the Roundel, and began another toward the water &s;ide, to batter the Flanks of the City on that &s;ide. And now the three Attacks having made their Approaches to the Breaches that now &s;eem'd wide enough, all things were preparing for a general A&s;&s;ault, there being two thou&s;and &s;caling Ladders in a readine&s;s to make fal&s;e Attacks and &s;cale the Walls, while others mounted the Breaches.</P>
<P>The 22. Nothing pa&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, nor in that of the <HI>Brandenburgher:</HI> but the Enemy this morning &s;prang two Mines, which did no other Execution than only ruin a part of the Curtin, where there was no Breach before. The new Battery likewi&s;e of four pieces upon the brink of the Ditch of the Roundel being fini&s;hed, the Turks gave 'em a mo&s;t bloody Serenade by break of day; for &s;allying out in a good number, they &s;tole down into the Trench along the Pali&s;ade, and being come to the &s;aid Battery before they were di&s;covered, through the darkne&s;s of the Night, they &s;et up a mo&s;t dreadful How|ling and Hollowing, nayl'd three pieces of Cannon and a Mortar, and ruined &s;ome part of the Gabions of the Battery: The <HI>Saxons</HI> of the adjoining Po&s;ts ha&s;tning to the Relief of their Friends, were put into &s;ome Di&s;order; but Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Badens</HI> Re|giment, being the Re&s;erve, coming up in time, repelled the Ene|my with the lo&s;s of thirty men &s;tain. Which was but a &s;mall thing in compari&s;on of the Lo&s;s which we &s;uffered, which a|mounted to above a hundred killed and wounded, the mo&s;t part
<PB N="33" REF="19"><HI>Saxons</HI> and <HI>Bavarians.</HI> Among the &s;lain were Collonel <HI>Lehel</HI> of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Forces, and &s;ome inferiour Officers: The Sieur <HI>Ge&s;ch|wint,</HI> Collonel of the Artillery, was al&s;o dangerou&s;ly ga&s;hed and hack'd with a Scimiter. However the <HI>Turks</HI> got no advantage by this Salley; for the Nails being ea&s;ily pull'd out of the Can|non and Mortar, within an hour after they began to play a|gain as if they had never been nail'd. And the revenge which they returned was &s;peedy; for one of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Bombs light|ing into the Magazin of Powder in the Ca&s;tle, the whole Pile blew up into the Air with &s;uch a hideous havock and thundring noi&s;e, as not only &s;hook the whole City, but our Camp likewi&s;e; and by what we afterwards under&s;tood from the De&s;erters, there mi&s;erably peri&s;hed by that blow above a thou&s;and per&s;ons of all Ages, which were buried in the Ruins of the Buildings, the Stones of which were thrown with that violence and va&s;t quantity into the Approaches, that they re&s;embled a &s;howr of Hail, and wound|ed &s;everal of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 23. the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent in the Afternoon the Count of <HI>Conning&s;egg</HI> with an Interpreter to the be&s;ieged, with a Sum|mons to &s;urrender, in regard all the Mines were ready to &s;pring, and all things were prepared for a general A&s;&s;ault: During which time there was a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms on both &s;ides, which was &s;pent in the Interment of the &s;lain. The &s;aid Count, after he had been two hours in the City, returned to the Camp with a Letter from <HI>Abdi Ba&s;&s;a</HI> in a Pur&s;e of red Damask, which he de|livered to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> wherein the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> made him a haughty and arrogant An&s;wer, purporting, That not being nece&s;|&s;itated to a Surrender, he could not dream of &s;uch a vile piece of Cowardice: that he fought for the Glory of his <HI>Prophet,</HI> and the Honour of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;el-men:</HI> that he and his Garri&s;on were re&s;ol|ved to hold out to the utmo&s;t Extremty, and defend it to the la&s;t ga&s;p of Breath: that the place being intru&s;ted to his care by the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> he would pre&s;erve it, or lo&s;e his Life: that when the Duke &s;hould come to wre&s;t it from him, he &s;hould find him upon the Breach ready to di&s;pute his Entrance; and let him order the A&s;&s;ault when he plea&s;ed, he would expect him without &s;tirring afoot.</P>
<P>The Duke having read this in&s;olent An&s;wer, cau&s;ed all the Batteries to fire with greater fury than before, and cau&s;ed all pre|parations to be ha&s;tened to give a general A&s;&s;ault by break of day; to which purpo&s;e he &s;ent for a thou&s;and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Foot,
<PB N="33" REF="19">who had voluntarily offered them&s;elves to mount the Breaches.</P>
<P>So haughty an An&s;wer, and a Defence of the be&s;ieged &s;o ob&s;ti|nate and brave, &s;hews us by Experience that the Characters which the De&s;erters had given us at the beginning of the Siege, of <HI>Abdi Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s conduct, were utterly fal&s;e, in &s;aying he was contemptible to the Soldiery for being more a Merchant than a Soldier; and the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> was to blame in going about to di&s;place him as he had de&s;igned: for it is to be pre&s;umed that hardly any other than he, would have &s;o long eluded the Fury of &s;uch a Potent Ar|my.</P>
<P>This day &s;ome <HI>Bavarians,</HI> that kept the advanced Guards, ob|&s;erving that a <HI>Polonian,</HI> who &s;erved in our Army, had had a pri|vate Conference with two <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;eized upon him at his return to the Camp, and carried him to the Elector, where having been &s;earched and examined, he was found to be a Spy, and that he had di&s;covered to the Enemies all that had pa&s;&s;ed in our Camp; whereupon he was pre&s;ently &s;entenced and executed without any more ado. This evening al&s;o a <HI>Bavarian</HI> Cannoneer was appre|hended, who was going over to the Enemy, and had already pa&s;|&s;ed the Guards.</P>
<P>The 24. This morning, about eight of the Clock, a large Mine was &s;prung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, and three hundred cho&s;en Foot were ordered out to lodg them&s;elves upon the Breach, together with &s;ome hundreds of <HI>Hungarians:</HI> but the effect of the Mine was contrary to all expectation; for it ruined and overthrew a part of our Approaches, and filled our Lines with Earth, be&s;ides that we had a hundred men killed and wounded. Whereupon his Serene Highne&s;s &s;eeing this ill Succe&s;s, ordered the Batteries to redouble their firing to inlarge their Bteaches, and to reduce them to &s;uch a Condition, as to be mounted without making any Mines. The new Battery of the <HI>Bavarians</HI> toward the water &s;ide was fi|ni&s;hed this night; and that other which they had rai&s;ed on the &s;ide of the Ditch, had already broken down a good part of the Wall on the right hand.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent Orders to the Count of <HI>Nigrelli,</HI> who commanded in <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> during the ab&s;ence of the Count of <HI>A&s;premont,</HI> to come to the Army and officiate the place of General of Battalia: by intercepted Letters al&s;o he was in|formed that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> encouraged the be&s;ieged to defend them&s;elves, promi&s;ing that by the eighth or tenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at the farthe&s;t, he would come and relieve them with a formidable
<PB N="34" REF="20">Army. The &s;ame day likewi&s;e General <HI>Caprara,</HI> who commands the Body of the Imperial Forces upon the River <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> &s;ent an Officer to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to give them the news of a great Advantage which he had gained upon the Garri&s;on of <HI>Agria</HI> the fifteenth of this Month, by the means of two Ambu&s;cadoes which he laid for the <HI>Turks;</HI> into which having drawn &s;ix hundred of tho&s;e Barbarians, he utterly defeated 'em, kill'd three hundred upon the place, together with <HI>O&s;man Ba&s;ha</HI> the Governour of <HI>Agria;</HI> and taken ninety Pri&s;oners, among whom he found the <HI>Vice-Ba&s;ha</HI> dangeroully wounded: and that in this Action General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> had behaved him&s;elf with his wonted Gallantry, as had al&s;o done the Sieurs <HI>Pecerha&s;i</HI> and <HI>Sem|&s;ay</HI> with their <HI>Hungarians.</HI></P>
<P>The 25. Nothing was done but only carrying on the Reparati|ons of the Works ruined by the Mine which was &s;prung the day before to our di&s;advantage. The Duke of <HI>Loarrin</HI> ha&s;tened with all the vigour imaginable the preparations for a general A&s;&s;ault, having ordered the making &s;uch parading places as were nece&s;&s;ary within the Lines and Approaches: and the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Bran|denburghers</HI> did the like in their Quarters. Between four and five in the afternoon the be&s;ieged &s;et fire to a little Mine on the right hand of the Roundel; which done, they &s;allied forth with two hundred foot, who were as &s;oon repul&s;ed by our men that were up|on the Guard. The Enemy left fourteen behind them &s;lain, and car|ried &s;ome wounded along with 'em: A while after they &s;alli'd out with a greater number upon the <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> who repelled 'em with the &s;ame ea&s;e: Not long after they returned with a greater number, and put the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Guards into &s;ome di&s;order, which obliged the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to order the Re|&s;erve, that lay po&s;ted at the VVall of the low Town, to advance; which General <HI>Souches,</HI> who commanded the Trenches, divided into three parts; of which one was planted one on the left hand to|ward the water &s;ide; the other entred the Approaches; and the third was ordered to &s;tand firm near the <HI>Mo&s;que.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ordered the Battalions of <HI>Mansfield, Salm, Souches,</HI> to ad|vance on the right hand. The Skirmi&s;h continued &s;ome time, and the Turks retreated &s;everal times, then made Head again, fil|ling the Air with their barbarous Cries. The <HI>Heydukes,</HI> after the fir&s;t di&s;charge, encountred the <HI>Turks,</HI> but gave ground, and caus'd &s;ome confu&s;ion among ours that advanc'd upon the left of the o|ther <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> whence the be&s;ieged fired with their Cannon, yet
<PB N="35" REF="20">without doing any con&s;iderable damage: &s;o that the Enemy &s;ee|ing they could gain nothing but blows, retired into the City. Count <HI>Starenburgh</HI> &s;ignalized him&s;elf in this Action, giving all ne|ce&s;&s;ary Orders to our men; but his <HI>Adjutant</HI> had both his Legs carried away by a Cannon &s;hot. The Battalions of <HI>Souches</HI> and <HI>Mansfield</HI> were but cour&s;ely handled, of whom many were &s;lain. The Baron <HI>d' A&s;ti</HI> was wounded in the Foot, the Baron of <HI>Hoben|warth</HI> &s;lain, and &s;ome inferiour Officers were likewi&s;e kill'd and wounded, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">out an hundred common Soldiers. But the lo&s;s of the <HI>Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> was much more con&s;iderable, as we under&s;tood by a <HI>German</HI> boy who made his e&s;cape out of the City, where he had been ever &s;ince the <HI>Turks</HI> were beaten from <HI>Vienna,</HI> by whom he had been taken and &s;old to an Inhabitant of <HI>Buda.</HI> This boy reported that the <HI>Turks</HI> made great Intrenchments within the Town, and that the Gari&s;on was &s;till five thou&s;and fighting men. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack there was nothing pa&s;&s;ed con&s;idera|ble.</P>
<P>The 26. During the whole Siege never was more diligence u&s;ed in carrying on to perfection the Lines and Approaches than la&s;t night, and all this, as al&s;o for the making of Parading Places, which were by this time fini&s;hed, and every thing prepared for a general A&s;&s;ault, and to lodg them&s;elves upon the breaches of the Roun|dels and Walls, &s;o that at length we might make our &s;elves Ma|&s;ters of that Important Place that had already co&s;t us &s;o much blood. This day likewi&s;e the be&s;ieged made a &s;light &s;alley upon the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Quarters, which proved to their di&s;advantage; for they were con&s;trained, after they had &s;tood the fir&s;t Charge, to retreat back to the City fa&s;ter than they came.</P>
<P>The 27. All things being ready at length for a general A&s;&s;ault, and the Companies that were to &s;erve in this Action being drawn up in their &s;everal Parading Places, as well in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack as in tho&s;e of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> it was re&s;olved that the On&s;et &s;hould be given about five in the Evening, to which purpo&s;e the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had given out his Orders to all the Officers, both Superiour and Inferiour, what they were to do. The Faggots, Gabions, Spades, Pickaxes, Hatchets, and Sacks of Earth were all in a readine&s;s, as well to dig down the In|trenchments of the Enemies, as for the Defence of the A&s;&s;ailants, when they &s;hould be Ma&s;ters of the Breach. The Signal was gi|ven from <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> by the di&s;charge of &s;ome great Guns; and the A&s;&s;ault was managed after the following manner. Forty Grana|deers
<PB N="36" REF="21">under a Captain Lieutenant and Serjeant, were placed fir&s;t at the head of the Right-hand-Roundel, they were followed by fifty Fu&s;eleers, and fifty Souldiers with Hatchets, under a Captain Lieutenant, and Serjeant. The&s;e were fir&s;t to mount the Breach and drive away the Enemy. A Captain, a Lieutenant, and Ser|jeant, with a hundred men carrying Spades and Pickaxes, made the fir&s;t Line, &s;econded by two Captains, two Lieutenants, and two Serjeants, with two hundred Mu&s;queteers, the whole under the Prince of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> grand Ma&s;ter of the Teutonick Order, who had the management of this Attack. That of the middle, toward the Curtin was under the Direction of Lieutenant-General <HI>Souches;</HI> to carry on that, were fifty Granadeers under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant. One hundred Fu&s;eleers under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant; and to &s;econd the&s;e there were two Captains, two Lieutenants, and two Serjeants, with two hundred Mu&s;queteers, divided into two &s;quadrons, followed by a hundred men with Shovels and Pickaxes.</P>
<P>The Attack on the left hand of the little Roundel was ordered by the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> after the following manner.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd Line behind the &s;acks fill'd with Earth, Wool, and &s;uch like materials, were po&s;ted the Arquebu&s;iers, made choice of upon this occa&s;ion, who were not to &s;tir, but to fire continually upon the Turks that &s;hould &s;hew them&s;elves upon the Breaches. The <HI>Heydukes,</HI> commanded by the Deputy-Go|vernor of <HI>Raab,</HI> were po&s;ted toward the Water-&s;ide, where a great part of the Wall was thrown down by the Fire which hap|pened in the Magazine, which had been blown up &s;ome days before. They were only to make a fal&s;e Attack, and were &s;e|conded by a Serjeant Major, with &s;ome &s;elect Companies. The &s;uperior Officers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal Po&s;ts to do the Duty of their Employments. To which purpo&s;e the Marque&s;s of <HI>Nigrelli,</HI> Ge|neral of Battalia, Collonel <HI>Keth,</HI> and the Baron <HI>de Rederer,</HI> and the Serjeant-Major of <HI>Starenbergh</HI> &s;tood by the grand Ma&s;ter of the Teutonic Order. Lieutenant-General <HI>Souches</HI> had for his A&s;|&s;i&s;tants Baron <HI>Diependael,</HI> General of Battalia, the Count <HI>D'Oe|tinghen,</HI> Collonel, Lieutenant-Collonel <HI>Jonger,</HI> and the Serjeant-Major to <HI>Croy.</HI> There were above twelve hundred men for a Re&s;erve in the clo&s;e way, commanded by the General of Batta|lia <HI>Thungen,</HI> under twelve Captains, twelve Lieutenants, and other inferior Officers, with all the Lieutenant-Collonels, and Ser|jeant-Majors to &s;ucceed in the Places of tho&s;e that &s;hould be
<PB N="37" REF="21">kill'd or wounded. Which twelve hundred Mu&s;queteers were to advance in little Bodies in the Lines as the others gained ground. The re&s;t of the Infantry &s;tood to their Arms ready to fight, and the Generals in the Trenches.</P>
<P>In this Order, the Soldiers full of Courage and Gallantry, went to the A&s;&s;ault, and mounted the Breaches, where they &s;ound great Re&s;i&s;tance, e&s;pecially at the great Roundel, where the A&s;|cent to the Breach was high, and the Defendants numerous and well re&s;olv'd. Ours were two or three times repul&s;ed, yet every time renewing the A&s;&s;ault, at length they made them&s;elves ma|&s;ters of the Breach, and made good their Po&s;ts. The <HI>Branden|burghers</HI> got Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the little Wall, among whom were fifty <HI>Heydukes</HI> that behaved them&s;elves very well. The Fight la&s;ted from five till nine at Night, with great Effu&s;ion of Blood, not &s;o much by the Enemies Weapons as by their Mines, and the Powder which they had &s;trew'd in &s;everal places, to which they &s;till &s;et Fire as they were driven from their Po&s;ts. There could be nothing more lamentable than to &s;ee between two or three hundred men at a time blown up into the Air by the force of their Mines, who were partly killed, and partly de&s;perately wounded. Yet for all this the Enemy could not terrify our men, nor by their ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance prevent 'em from lodging upon the Roundels, and upon the Curtin. There was no great good done by the <HI>Heydukes</HI> that were with the Imperiali&s;ts, for they were greatly afraid of Fire, and that Fear di&s;courag'd 'em from making the fal&s;e Attack toward the Water Side. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and Count <HI>de Starenbergh,</HI> &s;tood near the grand Ma&s;ter of the Teutonic Order, with their Swords in their Hands, en|couraging the Officers and Soldiers to do their Duty. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> &s;tood in the middle near the Curtin, where he was wounded.</P>
<P>Night parting the Combat, they fini&s;hed their Lodgments with two Lines of Communication of the Approaches to the Roundels po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and they put the Miners to Work at the Wall or En|trenchment within, where the <HI>Turks</HI> fortified them&s;elves. We cannot &s;ufficiently applaud the martial Valour of the Generals, Officers and Soldiers that were in this piece of Service, who were almo&s;t all wounded, in &s;ight of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> who&s;e Ad|jutant General, the <HI>Steur d' Artein,</HI> was &s;lain as he was carrying Orders. The number of the Slain was not very great, but that of the wounded extraordinary; among whom were the Prince of
<PB N="38" REF="22"><HI>Croy,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Commercy,</HI> General <HI>Diependale,</HI> General <HI>Thun|gen,</HI> the Baron of <HI>A&s;ti,</HI> who notwit&s;tanding he was wounded but two days before, would needs &s;ignalize him&s;elf in this Action, where he received a &s;econd wound, the Serjeant-Major of <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">aren|bergh,</HI> two Captains of the &s;ame Regiment, the Baron of <HI>Redere,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> Serjeant Major <HI>Pini,</HI> Count <HI>Schlick,</HI> Baron <HI>Gera,</HI> and &s;everal other Captains; Lieutenants, and other inferior Officers. On the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> &s;ide, Count <HI>Donaw,</HI> Colonel of Foot, was Slain, as al&s;o the <HI>Sieur Marwitz,</HI> Serjeant-major, and the Prince of <HI>Curland</HI> grievou&s;ly wounded; with &s;everal others.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, the Elector had ordered the On&s;et in this manner. The Pali&s;ado's upon the Breach-being burnt the day before by forty &s;elected Soldiers, his Electoral Highne&s;s command|ed a Lieutenant with twenty Fu&s;eleers, a Serjeant with &s;ix Vo|lunteers and ten Granadeers, a Corporal with &s;ix Carpenters, to cut the Palli&s;ado's: A hundred Mu&s;queteers under a Captain and two Lieutenants, had Orders to Po&s;t them&s;elves at the Enemies Palli&s;ado's, and to Fire continually, the better to &s;ecure the Work|men to make a Lodgment upon the Roundel, among which there were twenty five with Shovels and Pickaxes, and &s;eventy five with Hatchets under a Captain; all which were guarded by a Leiute|nant-Collonel, a Serjeant-Major; and a Captain, with fifty men arm'd with Half-pikes, Halberds and Parti&s;ans, a Lieutenant with thirty Granadeers, and two hundred Mu&s;queteers under two Captains and two Lieutenants. This Order being ob&s;erved as well upon the right Hand as upon the left, the two adjoyning Re|doubts were fini&s;hed with thirty Arquebu&s;iers each, and three Bat|talions of Imperiali&s;ts, <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Saxons,</HI> were to &s;econd the A&s;&s;ailants. The Cannoneers and Bombardeers had order to Fire from all the Batteries, and to throw Bombs and Carca&s;&s;es, with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, into the Ca&s;tle, and between the two fir&s;t Walls towards the Water-&s;ide.</P>
<P>All things thus ordered, they advanced through the Overtures toward the Breach (tho very high and difficult to a&s;cend) on the right and left Hand of the Roundel, as al&s;o of the Curtin, and with that Fury, that they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the Po&s;t, and drave away the Enemy, notwith&s;tanding their continual firing their Muskets, and a &s;howre of Stones, which they threw from the Windows of the Ca&s;tle. They al&s;o made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the <HI>Swinger,</HI> which is a great &s;pace of Ground in form of a Retreating
<PB N="39" REF="22">Place, between the Wall and the Hou&s;es. But this place being commanded by the higher Walls, from which the Enemy did much endamage our men with their Granadoes, Stones, and Bombs, his Electoral Highne&s;s cau&s;ed tho&s;e that had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of it to retire, thinking it &s;ufficient to &s;ecure their Lodgments upon the Roundel and the Wall of the Ca&s;tle, with a Line of Communication from the Gate of the Bridge to the <HI>Swinger-Gate;</HI> to the end they might have the Bridge in their own power; to which purpo&s;e they al&s;o rai&s;ed tran&s;ver&s;e Lines, and two Redoubts. His Electoral Highne&s;s &s;hewed him&s;elf all the while on the fir&s;t Po&s;ts, encouraging his men with his pre&s;ence. All the Generals &s;ignalized their Courage by &s;triving to outvie one another, as did al&s;o the Officers, Volunteers and Soldiers, who fought with all the bravery that could be expected from men of Courage. The <HI>Turks</HI> who defended the Ca&s;tle and <HI>Swinger,</HI> were for the mo&s;t part kill'd and wounded, only &s;ome few that &s;aved them&s;elves by flight. There were found eight pieces of Cannon, and two Mortar Pieces, which were made u&s;e of to batter the &s;econd Wall, or the Enemies Parapet within the City. In this A&s;&s;ault of the <HI>Bavurians</HI> were killed two Lieutenants of the Regiment of <HI>Baden,</HI> and five Cap|tains, one Lieutenant, and three En&s;igns wounded. Of the Re|giment of <HI>Beck,</HI> the Baron of <HI>Welsbergh,</HI> Lieutenant Collonel, five Captains, three Lieutenants, and five En&s;igns wounded. Of the Regiment of <HI>A&s;premont,</HI> the Collonel, Lieutenant Collonel, Count <HI>Nicholas Palfi,</HI> Serjeant Major Count <HI>Zacco,</HI> &s;even Cap|tains, five Lieutenants, and two En&s;igns wounded, and one En|&s;ign killed. Of the Regiment of <HI>Fur&s;tenbergh,</HI> one Captain, one Lieutenant, and one En&s;ign wounded. In the Elector's Regi|ment of Guards, one Captain killed, the Serjeant-Major, one Captain and three Lieutenants wounded. In the Regiment of <HI>Steinau,</HI> the Serjeant-Major and one Lieutenant &s;lain, one Cap|tain, two Lieutenants, and one En&s;ign wounded. In the Regi|ment of <HI>Rummel,</HI> one Captain, and one Lieutenant killed; three Captains and one En&s;ign wounded. In the Regiment of <HI>Seibol&s;torfe,</HI> the Serjeant Major &s;lain, one Captain and two Lieutenants wounded. In the Regiment of <HI>Gallenfels,</HI> the Lieutenant Collonel killed, two Captains and one Lieutenant wounded. The Generals, <HI>La Vergne, Rummel</HI> and <HI>A&s;prement,</HI> are in the number of the wounded; as al&s;o the Duke of <HI>E&s;calona,</HI> a Grandee of <HI>Spain;</HI> and &s;ome other Volunteers of note: In all, what with Officers, what with common Soldiers, One hundred
<PB N="40" REF="23">and &s;eventeen killed, and Nine hundred &s;eventy two wounded. In the <HI>Saxon</HI> Regiments, there was one Lieutenant Collonel, and &s;ome Inferiour Officers killed, one Lieutenant Collonel, two Ser|jeant-Majors, two Captains, one Captain Lieutenant, three En|&s;igns, two Serjeants, and two Corporals wounded: which, toge|ther with the common Soldiers, made up &s;eventy &s;lain, and One hundred ninety nine wounded: So that the number of the &s;lain and wounded in all the three Attacks, during this vigorous on&s;et, &s;omewhat exceeds three thou&s;and.</P>
<P>The 28. There was nothing done in all the three Attacks, their time being &s;pent in burying the dead, and &s;ecuring their Lodg|ments upon the breaches. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> al&s;o cau&s;ed three Mines to be opened under the &s;econd Wall in three &s;everal parts, which was al&s;o done in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> At|tack.</P>
<P>The 29. About &s;even in the morning three Mines were &s;prung under the &s;econd Wall, with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s, that they made a nota|ble breach in it, and filled up one part of the Trench. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> al&s;o advanced on the right hand of the Roundel, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of two Mortar Pieces, which they turn'd upon the be&s;ieged. The &s;ame day the great Cannon were planted nearer to the Town, with a re&s;olution to batter the in&s;ide of the City with a hundred Pieces of Cannon, and forty Mortar Pieces, if the <HI>Turks</HI> per&s;i&s;ted in their Ob&s;tinacy: who neverthele&s;s went on with their Ditches and Intrenchments behind the Wall with great diligence. And now the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> finding that almo&s;t all the Generals of the Foot were wounded, and not in a condition to do Service, ordered for the future that two Generals of the Caval|ry &s;hould do Duty in the Approaches; <HI>viz.</HI> the Count of <HI>Stirum,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Lodron.</HI> Whereupon the former mounted the Trenches this evening with Lieutenant General <HI>Souches,</HI> and was Relieved the next day by the Grand Ma&s;ter of the Teutonic Order, and the Count of <HI>Lodron.</HI></P>
<P>The 30. A Battery of three Demi-Cannons, and another of four Mortar Pieces, were fini&s;hed upon the Curtin; and great diligence was u&s;ed to perfect &s;everal Mines, to the end they might be ready for &s;pringing the next day. Certain <HI>Ra&s;cians</HI> having made their e&s;cape out of the Town, reported, That though the be&s;ieged had re&s;olved to defend them&s;elves to the la&s;t; yet that they began to falter in their Re&s;olutions, and to cry out, That it was but rea&s;onable to prevent the farther effu&s;ion of blood. Up|on
<PB N="41" REF="23">which a Council of War was held, and after a &s;hort Con&s;ul|tation, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent a &s;econd Summons to the Go|vernour to Surrender, while there was yet a Door of Mercy o|pen, and that he might do it upon honourable Terms; which if he refu&s;ed, he would not be an&s;werable for the blood that &s;hould be &s;pilt, if the Place &s;hould be carried by A&s;&s;ault, for that the Soldiers would &s;pare neither Age nor Sex. <HI>Abdi Ba&s;&s;a</HI> kindly received his Highne&s;s's Letter, and de&s;ired a day to con&s;ult with the Officers of his Garri&s;on, which was granted him; and &s;o there was a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Arms. The De&s;erters that left the Town in great numbers, a&s;&s;ured us, that in the la&s;t A&s;&s;ault, meer|ly in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, the <HI>Turks</HI> had three hundred men kill'd, and &s;even hundred wounded. We had Intelligence this evening, that four thou&s;and Turki&s;h Hor&s;e were &s;een four Leagues from the Camp, being &s;ent to di&s;cover the Condition of the Place; but that being afraid of being &s;urpriz'd, they retreated as &s;uddainly.</P>
<P>The 31. About nine of the clock in the morning the Count of <HI>Lamberg,</HI> Adjutant General, was commanded by the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to go with an Interpreter and receive the Governour's An&s;wer; which was to this effect: <HI>That he neither could nor would &s;o ea&s;ily &s;urrender the City which was the Key of the</HI> Ottoman <HI>Em|pire; but that if he would make a general Peace, they would &s;ur|render into our hands &s;ome other Town equivalen.</HI> In the afternoon the Enemy de&s;ired a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, and &s;ent two <HI>Aga's</HI> in Ho&s;tage to his Electoral Highne&s;s, who &s;ent in their place the Baron of <HI>Creux,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel of the Regiment of <HI>Baden,</HI> with an Interpreter. The <HI>Turks</HI> received him with great Ceremony, and all the Civilities imaginable. However, he was not conducted to the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> but into another Hou&s;e, the Streets as he pa&s;&s;ed along being lined with Soldiers in Arms, and in very good order, though not many in number: So &s;oon as he came into the Hou&s;e, he was pre&s;ented with Rice, a roa&s;ted Pullet, and little Pa&s;ties, with Coffee and Wine. The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> Governour &s;ent his Excu&s;e, <HI>That he could not &s;peak with him as yet, until he had con&s;ulted the other Captains of the Garri&s;on, what Propo&s;itions to make him.</HI> In which Interval &s;e|veral Turki&s;h Officers came to vi&s;it the Baron. Half an hour after, the Governour &s;ent word, <HI>That he would take it for a kind|ne&s;s if he would be plea&s;ed to come over to his Hou&s;e;</HI> which the Baron agreed to; and went accompanied with a great number of
<PB N="42" REF="24"><HI>Turks,</HI> of which the two chiefe&s;t took him under the Arm, and &s;o led him before the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> who was in a Lodging of Wood over again&s;t his Hou&s;e, very well adorned, and &s;pread with rich Tape&s;tries; at which time having cau&s;ed a Seat to be &s;et for the Baron, he told him, <HI>That he look'd upon him&s;elf to be very un|fortunate to be in &s;uch a Place, which had been &s;everal times be|&s;ieged without &s;ucce&s;s, and now happened to be &s;o long abandoned without Relief. On the other &s;ide, that he was &s;o earne&s;tly pre&s;t by the Emperour's Son-in-Law, and the Grand Vizier, that he wi&s;hed he were able to give his Re&s;olution touching the Surrender of the Place; but that being an Affair of great Importance, and as much as his Life was worth, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to re&s;olve upon Surrender:</HI> adding withal, <HI>That if they would require any other Place in</HI> Hungary, <HI>it &s;hould be delivered into the Emperour's hands.</HI> To which the Baron an&s;wered, <HI>That he had no Commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;|cour&s;e of Conditions, but to know of the</HI> Ba&s;ha <HI>him&s;elf, whether he would &s;urrender or no: That it behov'd him to con&s;ider that our men were already Ma&s;ters of the City: That it would be too late to Ca|pitulate if he &s;tay'd till another A&s;&s;ault, when it would not be in the power of the Generals to repre&s;s the fury of the Soldiers, nor to prevent this Siege from being no le&s;s Tragical than that of</HI> New|hau&s;el. To which the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> made no other An&s;wer, but only &s;hrugged up his &s;houlders, remaining mute like one that had been Thunder-&s;trook: But as the Baron was going about to depart, he de&s;ird him to go along with him into his Cabinet, whither ha|ving called the <HI>Mu&s;ti,</HI> and three other <HI>Turks</HI> of the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable Quality, he declared to him moreover, <HI>That he could not by any means do the Grand Signior &s;o great a prejudice as to &s;ur|render a Place upon which depended two hundred Leagues of Coun|try, and which was the Key of</HI> Turky; <HI>and then offered again any other City of</HI> Hungary <HI>with its Appendances and Dependencies:</HI> yet at length prote&s;ting farther, <HI>That if he would give him any A&s;&s;u|rances of a general Peace with the Port, that he would then re|&s;olve to &s;urrender the City of</HI> Buda. But the Baron, who had no Commi&s;&s;ion to treat, took leave of the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> only telling him, <HI>That he would communicate, both to the Elector and the Duke of</HI> Lorrain, <HI>the Declaration which he had made: but that he could not a&s;&s;ure him that things would be &s;o concluded.</HI> The <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> de&s;ired him to publi&s;h his Declaration through the Camp in writing, and de&s;ired to be reconducted to the place where he was fir&s;t me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">; which was done with a great deal of Ceremony, being accompa|nied
<PB N="43" REF="24">by &s;everal of the Turki&s;h Officers to the Gate. But it was Impo&s;ible either for the Baron or the Interpreter to expre&s;s the wa&s;te which our Bombs have made in the City, where they have ruined the greate&s;t part of the Buildings. The Truce there|fore that had been ob&s;erved during this Inter-parley, was broken off ye&s;terday in the evening, at what time the great Guns began again to play with greater fury than before.</P>
<P>This day about Noon the Be&s;ieged &s;prang a &s;mall Counter-Mine to ruin our Mine made under their Battery oppo&s;ite to the great Roundel, but without any Execution. Two days after we &s;prang two of our Mines, which were made to fill up the Tren|ches, which &s;ucceeded very well: but in the afternoon Count <HI>Sta|renbergh,</HI> looking out between two Gabions, was unfortunately wounded with a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot in his right Thumb, the Cheek and Shoulder, but not dangerou&s;ly: however he pre&s;ently cau&s;ed his Thumb to be cut off, becau&s;e the Bone was broken. About twen|ty or thirty were this day wounded in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Branden|burghers</HI> Attack.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1. A Battery was fini&s;hed upon the Roundel, upon which were planted two pieces of Cannon. In the Morning was &s;prung the third Mine, near the &s;aid Roundel, but tho' it &s;uc|ceeded well, yet there was no other Attempt made, becau&s;e the Trench was not &s;ufficiently fill'd; whereupon a Re&s;olution was taken to fill it up with Faggots, &s;acks of Earth, and &s;uch like Materials. Our Miners Ye&s;terday &s;melt &s;uch a noy&s;om Stench in one of their Mines that they were &s;carce able to abide at their Work, till they had remov'd two Bodys that were half dead. About Noon we received intelligence that &s;even thou|&s;and Turks were po&s;ted at <HI>Sexaritwan,</HI> thirteen Leagues from <HI>Bu|da,</HI> and that the Grand Vizier had begun to pa&s;s the Bridg of <HI>E&s;|&s;eck</HI> with an Army which he had form'd out of the Gari&s;ons of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and places adjoyning, and other Campanies got toge|ther by force, among which were &s;even thou&s;and men drawn out of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina;</HI> and that of eight thou&s;and Jani&s;aries which the Grand Vizier had brought from the middle of <HI>Turkie,</HI> three thou&s;and had de&s;erted him in his March; that neverthele&s;s he hoped to be at the Head of fifty thou&s;and men, for the Relief of <HI>Buda.</HI> General <HI>Dunewald</HI> return'd this Evening with the Regiments of Hor&s;e, with which he had been &s;couting toward the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ain Intelligence of the Enemy. The Generals <HI>Caraffa</HI> and <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> arrived al&s;o from <HI>Zolnock,</HI> after two days March, with
<PB N="44" REF="25">five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and &s;ome Hungarian Companies. The next day Count <HI>Budiani</HI> arrived with two thou&s;and <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ngarians;</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> &s;ent expre&s;s Orders to General <HI>Scherffen|bergh</HI> to joyn him with his Body of ten thou&s;and Men. About this time his mo&s;t &s;erene Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> had had &s;ome two or three Fits of an Ague: However he failed not to appear every day in the Trenches, and to give all nece&s;&s;ary Orders for the carrying on the Siege: To which purpo&s;e great Preparations were made for a &s;econd On&s;et upon the &s;econd Wall. This Morning the <HI>Bavarians</HI> beat down a great part of the Wall with their Cannon, and by the &s;pringing of a Mine; and made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the &s;econd Swinger, where they al&s;o &s;eized upon the Cannons and Mortar Pieces of the Enemy, which they turned upon the City.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 2. They continued filling up the Trench; and every thing was ready for an A&s;&s;ault, which was delay'd by rea&s;on of the continual Rains that fell. Upon repeated Advice of the Ap|proach of the Grand Vizier, who, as our Scouts a&s;&s;ured us, had pa&s;s'd the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> all nece&s;&s;ary Preparations were made to receive the Enemy, in ca&s;e they attempted to relieve the Town.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 3. A De&s;erter, who affirm'd him&s;elf to be a Dome|&s;tic Servant to one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Officers in the City, &s;urrendered him&s;elf, and declared that the Be&s;ieged had a Mine ready to &s;pring in the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> Attack, and had begun a &s;econd: That they impatiently expected Relief: And that of all tho&s;e whom the Ba&s;&s;a had &s;ent abroad, not one was returned into the City, which very much perplexed him; and that the number of &s;erviceable Soldiers &s;till exceeded two thou&s;and, be|&s;ides the Inhabitants. The Miners could not fini&s;h the grand Mine, by rea&s;on of a Rock which they met with. But upon the Breaches certain little Banks were made, to the end the Soldiers might fire with greater Advantage upon the Be&s;ieged during the A&s;&s;ault, which was ordered after the following manner. About Noon the Trenches were reliev'd, and they that were relieved were to &s;erve as a Re&s;erve. The fir&s;t Attack was on the right Hand of the Roundel, to which were appointed fifty Granadeers under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant, followed by twenty men that carryed great &s;tore of Granado's. They were followed by fifty Fu&s;eleers, under a Captain, a Lieutenant, and a Serjeant; and after them march'd fifty men with Hatchets. The
<PB N="45" REF="25">&s;ame Order was ob&s;erved by the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> on the left Hand. To the third Attack of the midle Curtain, the <HI>Hun|garians</HI> were a&s;&s;ign'd, preceded by thirty <HI>Germans,</HI> and followed by &s;ixty, with nece&s;&s;ary Officers. The On&s;et began between five and &s;ix in the Evening, in the Pre&s;ence of all the Generals, the grand Ma&s;ter of the Teutonic Order commanding the Trench. They forbore to make any fal&s;e Attack, becau&s;e the Mine had not done that Execution that was expected. But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being informed by an Adjutant that the Elector of <HI>Ba|varia</HI> had ab&s;olutely begun the A&s;&s;ault, commanded that the fal&s;e Attack &s;hould be chang'd into a formal On&s;et. The Com|bat la&s;ted two hours, in which three hundred Hor&s;emen that &s;erv'd on foot, behav'd them&s;elves with great valour, as did al&s;o the <HI>Hungarians.</HI> But the Breach being hard to mount, the be|&s;ieged well defended with Pali&s;adoes, and fighting like men in de&s;pair, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> would not hazard more men to maintain the inner Breach, where our men had lodged them&s;elves already, and therefore &s;ounded a Retreat, contenting him&s;elf with making a Lodgment on the right hand of the Roundel of the Angle, where forty men entrenched them&s;elves forthwith. We had few men kill'd by the Enemies firing, but about two hun|dred wounded with Stones and Arrows, which flew like Hail about the A&s;&s;ailants Ears. Count <HI>Leopold</HI> of <HI>Herber&s;tein,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel to <HI>Souches,</HI> was dangerou&s;ly wounded; the Sieur <HI>Bi&s;chop|&s;hau&s;en,</HI> Serjeant-Major in the Regiments of <HI>Suabia,</HI> carrying his Arm in a Scarf by rea&s;on of a former wound, was again wound|ed in the hand. Nor were the <HI>Bavarians</HI> in their Attack le&s;s pe|&s;ter'd with Stones and Arrows, and the Splinters of Bombs which the Enemy rowl'd down upon the Planks out of the windows of the Ca&s;tle, though to little purpo&s;e, &s;o that the lo&s;s on that &s;ide was not very con&s;iderable. The Prince of <HI>Savoy</HI> was wounded in the hand with an Arrow, together with three Captains, &s;ome inferiour Officers, &s;even or eight Volunteers, and ninety Soldiers killed and wounded. Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> going in the morn|ing to vi&s;it the Approaches, received a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, which burnt his <HI>Ju&s;tocore,</HI> and very much brui&s;ed his Brea&s;t, but the &s;trength of his Armour pre&s;erved him from death.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the 4th. They fired with a redoubled Force from all three Attacks to enlarge the Breaches and ruin the Enemies De|fences. The Line of Circumvallation was al&s;o fini&s;hed, and &s;trengthned with &s;everal Redoubts and &s;mall Forts to flank their
<PB N="46" REF="26">Works. The <HI>Imperiali&s;ts, Bavarians,</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> were al&s;o ordered to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of all the higher Grounds, where they might entrench to advantage. The <HI>Heydukes</HI> were po&s;ted all along the inner Wall of the low Town, and thus they continued their Attacks with the &s;ame vigour as before. The <HI>Ba|varians</HI> rai&s;ed a Battery of nine Pieces of four and twenty pound Ball upon the Roundel of the Ca&s;tle, with which they battered the Flanks, and widen'd the Breach; for in regard the Ground is very narrow, the Enemy had the more advantage to di&s;pute the Entrance of our Men. This day our Scouts brought Intelli|gence to the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had actual|ly pa&s;&s;ed the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> and that he had twenty thou&s;and fighting men about his Per&s;on, which, with the Forces that lay near <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> would make between forty and fifty thou&s;and men, for the mo&s;t part <HI>Veteranes</HI> drawn out of the Garri&s;ons of Cities and Fortre&s;&s;es; in who&s;e room he had put his new Levies and forc'd Men. We had al&s;o Intelligence the &s;ame day, that the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Agria,</HI> having drawn together about a thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> out of the Garri&s;ons of <HI>&V;pper Hungary,</HI> was come to <HI>Hat|wan,</HI> where he had commanded a great number of Waggons to be laden with Ferry-boats, to be carried to the <HI>Danaw,</HI> by the means of which he de&s;igned to put in a Reinforcement into <HI>Bu|da,</HI> at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Vizier</HI> a&s;&s;ail'd our Lines on the o|ther &s;ide. Upon which Intelligence all precautions imaginable were u&s;ed to prevent the De&s;igns of the Enemy, and &s;ecure the River on <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>The 5th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack they carried on their Approaches of the great Roundel toward the &s;econd Wall, where they had lodged them&s;elves after the la&s;t A&s;&s;ault. The Miners were al&s;o &s;et to work under the grand Roundel on the right hand of the Breach, to enable us to attack the Enemy in Flank: and in two other parts on the left hand under the Curtin, to blow up the Entrenchments of the Be&s;ieged behind the Breach. The &s;ame day they began to build a Gallery, to give a Pa&s;&s;age to the inner Trench; and the better to &s;ecure the Attack, Pali|&s;adoes were fixed to the Flanks of our Works. This night the Be&s;ieged did nothing but throw Bombs, Granadoes, and Stones to di&s;turb our Workmen; but all the hurt they did, was the kil|ling of three <HI>Heydukes,</HI> and wounding &s;ix or &s;even other Soldiers, In the Afternoon one of their Bombs lighted upon a Barrel of Powder, upon one of the Batteries, which kill'd five, and woun|ded three of our Men.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="26">
<P><HI>The &s;ixth of Augu&s;t.</HI> A new Battery of two Demy Cannons was rai&s;ed in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, behind the great Roundel, by means of which the Defence of the little Roundel was ruined, which had done us great Mi&s;chief. They al&s;o continued filling up the inner Trench with Bavins, Barrels, Sacks of Earth, and the like. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> vigurou&s;ly continued their Approaches; but nothing el&s;e con&s;iderable pa&s;&s;ed this day.</P>
<P><HI>Aug.</HI> 7. La&s;t Night we had &s;everal fal&s;e Alarums, as if the Turks had been at hand to attempt the Relief of the Town; which cau&s;ed us to labor hard in deepning the Trenches round about the Lines, and fortifying the Po&s;ts, to di&s;courage the Enemy from any de&s;ign to force our Camp. The Miners al&s;o were hard at work to get the Mines ready within the next three or four days. The <HI>Heydukes</HI> undertook in twenty four hours time to fill up the Trench of the &s;econd Wall, for a Reward of four thou&s;and Florins, which was promi&s;ed them by the Generals. And now the Breach in the &s;econd Wall was very much en|larged, which made the Generals re&s;olve upon a &s;econd A&s;&s;ault, &s;o &s;oon as the Mines &s;hould be ready. In the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack they met with great Difficulty to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Ca&s;tle, by rea&s;on of the &s;everal Walls and Defences which they had to force, and the ob&s;tinate Oppo&s;ition of the Be&s;ieged, which made the Elector re&s;olve to redouble his Cannon Batteries. And indeed they did nothing el&s;e but batter the Ca&s;tle with &s;everal Batterles; which play'd upon the Flanks and Curtins, that it could not be expected they &s;hould &s;tand long. This day his E|lectoral Highne&s;s having &s;ent abroad a Party of thirty <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> to gain Intelligence of the Enemy, they met an equal Party of the Turks, whom they pur&s;ued for two whole Hours together; but the Enemy was &s;o &s;wift of Heel, that they could only kill one, and take four Pri&s;oners whom they brought to the Camp. A|mong the&s;e Pri&s;oners there was an Aga, that four Years ago had been releas'd out of <HI>Raab</HI> for a Ran&s;om of eight thou&s;and Crowns. The&s;e Pri&s;oners declared that the Seralquier would be at <HI>Alba Regalis</HI> with twenty &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and would be followed by the Grand Vizier who was randevouzing his Army near the bridg of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> which would not be inferior to that which we brought la&s;t year to the Siege of <HI>Gran.</HI> They added likewi&s;e that the Sera&s;quier had Orders not to engage in a Battle with the Chri&s;tians, for fear of lo&s;ing the City of <HI>Buda</HI> and the Army both at once; only that he &s;hould endeavor to put in a
<PB N="48" REF="27">Reinforcement of Men into the Town, upon peril of his Life.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 8. In the Morning four thou&s;and Turks and Tartars, Hor&s;e, &s;hew'd them&s;elves upon a high ri&s;ing Ground, ju&s;t again&s;t the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter, and then retreated after &s;ome &s;light Skir|mi&s;hes with Count <HI>Budiani's Hu&s;&s;ars,</HI> reinforced with &s;ome Com|manded Troops and Volunteers. The Pri&s;oners then taken de|po&s;ed that the <HI>Sera&s;quier</HI> lay encamped under the Cannon of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> with twenty thou&s;and fighting Men, where he expected the Grand Vizier with the Body of the Army. But by the Re|lations of our Spies and Courriers, we were inform'd that the Grand Vizier wavered whether he &s;hould pa&s;s any farther with the whole Army, or whether he &s;hould &s;tay at the Bridge of <HI>E&s;|&s;eck</HI> with the greate&s;t part of his Forces, to make head again&s;t the <HI>Croats,</HI> who might ruin the Bridge if he for&s;ook it, and by that means cut off his Retreat. However it were, to prevent the wor&s;t, we continued fortifying our Camp, and playing with our Cannon and Mortar Pieces again&s;t the City.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 9. Some thou&s;ands of Turks po&s;ted them&s;elves &s;ome Leagues from our Camp in a very advantageous place, as if they intended to make &s;ome Attempt, but we were every way provi|ded for their Coming: Be&s;ides that the Souldiers were very Cou|ragious, and wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to come to Blows with the Enemy. However becau&s;e the Enemy gave us &s;uch frequent Alarums, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> ordered that all the Foot that was not in the Approaches, &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of within the Lines, and particularly in the Spurs of the Fortification. This Morn|ing a Bomb from the Be&s;ieged unfortunately lighting upon a Re|&s;erve of our Granado's, &s;et fire to it, and killed three, and wound|ed thirteen of our Men. This Evening &s;ome of the Turks &s;hewed them&s;elves again upon the right Hand, behind the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Camp. Toward which two Squadrons of the Enemy advanced to outbrave our Men; but &s;ome of our Volunteers &s;allying forth with a Re&s;olution to encounter them, they retreated with the lo&s;s only of one Man &s;lain.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 10. They wrought hard to fini&s;h the third Mine in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, the other two Mines being now ready to play. His Highne&s;s cau&s;ed the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Infantry to be po&s;ted all a|long the Wall of the low Town; from the water-Roundel to the <HI>German</HI> Quarters, where they &s;ecured them&s;elves with a deep Trench and a good Parapet: And becau&s;e the <HI>Danaw</HI> is very deep thereabout, two Barks filled with Stones were ordered to be
<PB N="49" REF="27">&s;unk, and &s;everal Pali&s;ado'd Spurs were rais'd all along the bank of the River, to di&s;courage the Enemy from de&s;igning any Re|lief that way. This morning the Enemy gave us another Alarm in the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter: whereupon all our Cavalry were com|manded to hor&s;e; but the Enemy retreated at the &s;ame time. It &s;eems their de&s;ign was to have forced a Pa&s;&s;age that way; but the <HI>Bavarians</HI> were too well entrenched for them to &s;ucceed in their Enterprize. The Prince of <HI>Croy</HI> being cured of his wounds, re-entred upon the Duty of his Employment, and appeared a|gain in the Approaches. Four <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> very well mounted, ad|vancing toward &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> of the Garri&s;on, made a &s;hew as if they intended to have charg'd 'em, but when they drew near, they talked lovingly together, and &s;hook hands: which being ob|&s;erved by &s;ome of the Mu&s;queteers in the Redoubt adjoyning, they went forth and fired upon the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ars,</HI> who betook them&s;elves to their heels; but one was wounded and taken Pri&s;oner, toge|ther with another of his Companions, the third e&s;caped, and the fourth got into the Town. The Pri&s;oners examined, declared that they only expo&s;tulated with the <HI>Turks</HI> about their holding out; but then they were put off to a more &s;trict Examina|tion.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 11. Some Troops of the Enemy &s;hewed them&s;elves up|on the Hill next to the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, toward the Road to <HI>Alba Regalis.</HI> As yet we could not learn the exact number of the Enemy, though our Spies a&s;&s;ured us that they were forty thou&s;and <HI>Turks,</HI> and twenty thou&s;and <HI>Tartars.</HI> But notwith|&s;tanding all the&s;e hot Alarms, being &s;o well fitted to receive 'em as we were, all things were at the &s;ame time preparing for a vi|gorous A&s;&s;ault of the &s;econd Wall, if the Mines did that execu|tion as was expected.</P>
<P>The 12th. In the morning all things being ready for an On|&s;et, three Mines were &s;prung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, which did no other Execution, than only overthrew &s;ome Pali&s;adoes. For the Miners had not digged deep enough under the Wall of the &s;econd Rampart; which made it apparent that they did not un|der&s;tand their Trade, though the be&s;t were &s;ought out and &s;ent for from &s;everal Parts, the Generals knowing that nothing would contribute more to the Reduction of this Place than well ordered Mines. Thereupon the A&s;&s;ault which was determined to have been given, had the Mines &s;ucceeded, was delay'd, and the Miners were again &s;et to work to make new ones. In the
<PB N="50" REF="28">Skirmi&s;hes which our Men had this Day with the Enemy, there was a <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officer &s;lain, who was no doubt obliged to have got into the Town. For there were Letters found about him, for the Governour of <HI>Buda,</HI> di&s;covering the Method which the Enemy intended to ob&s;erve, for the relief of the Town, which was to force one Quarter, and put Relief into the Town, without ha|zarding a Battle; and that eight Thou&s;and <HI>Tartars</HI> were to range the Country, as far as <HI>Gran,</HI> and cut off Provi&s;ion from our Men, and infe&s;t the Country with continual Inroads Upon which Intelligence, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> called a Council of War. Whereupon it was re&s;olved to leave a part of the Army to guard the Po&s;ts again&s;t the City, and to i&s;&s;ue forth out of the Lines with the re&s;t of the Imperial, and Auxiliary Forces, and go and meet the Enemy, who, as tho&s;e Letters &s;eemed to intimate, was above &s;ixty Thou&s;and Strong. Though the more Ju|dicious would not allow 'em to be above forty Thou&s;and Fighting Men.</P>
<P>The 13th. All the Army march'd out of the Lines, except twenty thou&s;and men that were left for the guard of our Works, and to hinder the Enemy from putting a Recruit into the Place. Com|mi&s;&s;ary-General <HI>Rabata</HI> caus'd a di&s;tribution of Oats and Hay for the Hor&s;es for three days: And be&s;ides we made a &s;hift to form a very noble Body of Volunteers under good Officers. The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> po&s;ted him&s;elf in view of the Enemy, four thou&s;and <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Heydukes</HI> keeping the Van-guard. Never|thele&s;s the Town was no le&s;s vigorou&s;ly batter'd and a&s;&s;ail'd than before. This Evening our Spies and &s;ome De&s;erters a&s;|&s;ur'd us that the night following the Enemy would put them|&s;elves in Battle-Array, to Attack us the next morning by break of day, which oblig'd the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> to di&s;po&s;e all things in readine&s;s for a Battel.</P>
<P>The 14th. Before Sun ri&s;e the Enemy had drawn out a Body of eight thou&s;and Men, part Jani&s;aries, part Spahi's, of the &s;toute&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;olute Soldiers in the Army, which being divided into divers le&s;&s;er Bodies, march'd from &s;ix till eight a Clock in the Morning, turning and winding to and again be|hind the Mountains towards <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> and entred into a Plain, de&s;igning to approach our Camp under the &s;helter of a great Valley. But the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> having ob&s;erv'd this contrivance of the Enemy, and under&s;tanding their de&s;ign, com|manded Count <HI>Dunewald,</HI> General of the Cavalry, to po&s;&s;e&s;s
<PB N="51" REF="28">him&s;elf of the ground on the left hand, with nine Imperial Re|giments, Cuira&s;&s;iers, Dragoons, and Croats, <HI>viz. Caprara</HI>'s, <HI>Pal|fy's, Taff's, Lodron's, Neuburgh's, Fur&s;tenbergh's, Stirum's, Serau's,</HI> and <HI>Schultz's;</HI> to which he added &s;ome <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars;</HI> and General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> had orders to po&s;t him&s;elf with his detachment upon a ri&s;ing ground on the right hand. The <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> next to General <HI>Dunewald</HI> were they that received the fir&s;t Charge, and although they fought with all the bravery imaginable, they were never|thele&s;s forced to give ground; but finding them&s;elves &s;econded by the <HI>Germans,</HI> they return'd to the Charge. The <HI>Turks</HI> having thus made the <HI>Hu&s;sars</HI> give ground, thought they &s;hould have a cheap bargain of the re&s;t. To which purpo&s;e they advanced with great fury, and loud outcries, again&s;t our Men, who recei|ved them without moving a foot: General <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> who had the upper ground, charged them vigorou&s;ly; &s;o that the Com|bat was ob&s;tinate and bloody: for though the Enemies &s;aw them&s;elves attack'd in Flank and Front, they did their utmo&s;t to cut their way through, till at length they were put into di&s;|order, &s;eparated, and con&s;train'd to fly: The &s;laughter that followed was very great; and it was a very plea&s;ant &s;ight to &s;ee the Jani&s;aries drop here and there, who being abandon'd by the Spahi's, and environ'd by ours, threw down their Arms and &s;hifted every one for them&s;elves. They were pur&s;u'd into the Plain; nor would it &s;erve their Turn, to throw them&s;elves among the Bu&s;hes to &s;helter them&s;elves from death; for they were Ma&s;&s;acred like Wild Bea&s;ts that fall into the Hunters Net. The <HI>Turks</HI> had three Thou&s;and Men killed upon the Spot, the mo&s;t part <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and all choice Men, who had undertaken to force a Quarter, and get into the City, or to peri&s;h; and to whom the Grand Vizier had given five Ducats a Head of Twenty, which he promi&s;ed to every one that &s;hould enter the City. They car|ried almo&s;t every one of them three Granadoes apiece, a Pickaxe. and a Shovel, to break down our Entrenchments, and fill up the Trenches. The number of the Wounded was very con&s;iderable; but there were not above five Hundred taken Pri&s;oners. There were taken thirty Colours and En&s;igns, and eleven pieces of Cannon, and ten Waggons laden with Ammunition.</P>
<P>All which co&s;t us but little Blood; we not having above &s;ixty Slain; among which were the Count of <HI>Lodron,</HI> General <HI>Lodron</HI>'s Brother, <HI>Caprara's</HI> Serjeant <HI>Major,</HI> and one of <HI>Dunewald</HI>'s Cap|tains: Of the number of the Wounded were two Captains, and thirty three Soldiers.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="29">
<P>This Fight thus over to our Advantage, the Enemy made &s;everal Motions, and ranged them&s;elves in a Plain that looks to|ward the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarter, and po&s;ting their Wings-upon the ri&s;ing Grounds, made a Shew as if they intended either to come to a Battel, or relieve the Place with all their Forces. There|upon a Council of War, wherein it was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the Enemy, which was undertaken by the Elector of <HI>Bava|ria,</HI> at the Head of his Army: but the &s;hortne&s;s of the time would not permit him to draw up his Men in a formal Array: &s;o that the <HI>Turks</HI> doubtful of his de&s;ign, retired. The two Generals, <HI>Dunewald,</HI> and <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> pur&s;ued the E|nemy beyond the Hills; and the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> al&s;o had a Rencounter with a con&s;iderable Party of the <HI>Turks</HI> that &s;tayed behind to favour the Retreat of the Army. Several Colours and Standards likewi&s;e were found &s;cattered along the Fields, which the Fugitives had thrown away, the better to make their E&s;cape. After this Victory, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> commanded &s;ome Companies to beat the little Woods and Bu&s;hes adjoining, where they found &s;everal <HI>Turks,</HI> who were all put to the Sword. For they had all the Spoil of the Enemy; among whom there was hardly one that had not the five Duckets which the Grand Vizier had given him, be&s;ides his other Mony. The be&s;ieged believing them&s;elves already reliev'd, fired continual|ly upon tho&s;e that guarded the Approaches, and thought to have ruin'd &s;ome of our Works; but in vain, for they were &s;till &s;o briskly receiv'd, that they had no Maw to hazard skirmi&s;h|ing any more. However they made one furious Sally upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, which prov'd very fatal to 'em, for they were not only repul&s;ed by the Regiments of <HI>Baden,</HI> and <HI>A&s;prem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">t,</HI> but their retreat being cut off, there was a great Slaughter made of them. And now the Enemy being retired without daring to come to any deci&s;ion of the di&s;pute, the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain</HI> drew all his Army within the Lines again, and di&s;patched away the young Count <HI>Pal&s;i,</HI> Captain in Count <HI>Pal&s;i</HI>'s Regi|ment, to carry the News to the Emperor, and to lay at his Feet twenty eight Colours and Standards won from the Enemy du|ring the fight. The re&s;t were &s;et up upon the great Roundel, to let the be&s;ieged under&s;tand the defeat of their Succours, which they expected with &s;o much impatience.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="29">
<P>The 15th. The <HI>Germans</HI> and <HI>Hungariaus</HI> that were upon the Scout, brought &s;everal Pri&s;oners to the Camp which they found in the Woods: they a&s;&s;ured us, that though the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had received this Repul&s;e, he would not fail to make other At|tempts to &s;uccour the Town, though he lo&s;t his whole Army by Piecemeals: and in truth, though the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army were a little retreated, yet they fail'd not to Alarm our Camp every night. This afternoon, order was given by the Generals to hang out a Signal, for a Parley by an Interpreter, to let them under|&s;tand by the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> who were Pri&s;oners, the Defeat of their Succours: but whether the Be&s;ieged perceived it, or no; they returned their An&s;wer by the Mouths of their great Guns and Mu&s;quets, with which they broke the Staff of a Turki&s;h En|&s;ign planted upon the great Roundel.</P>
<P>The 16th. They carried on vigorou&s;ly the Works of the three Attacks, and in the morning &s;et fire to the Pali&s;adoes and the Defences which the Be&s;ieged had made upon the Breaches of the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, notwith&s;tanding all the diligence of the Enemy to quench it: On the other &s;ide, while the&s;e things were a doing, the Enemy threw down a mo&s;t dreadful quantity of Stones, Gra|nadoes, Powder-bags, and other artificial Fire-works, upon our men; &s;o that four of tho&s;e that &s;et fire to the Pali&s;adoes were kill'd and burnt. A Recompence of twelve Crowns was given to every Soldier engaged in that Action. But in regard the On&s;et could not yet be given, the Enemy had lei&s;ure to fix new Pa|li&s;adoes, and repair their Defences in the night. On the <HI>Bava|rian</HI> &s;ide they ince&s;&s;antly battered the Ca&s;tle and the great Tower, which by this time were ready to tumble, through the force of the Battery.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI> 17. All things were ready for an A&s;&s;ault betimes in the morning, but the Enemy having repaired their Defences, and put double Pali&s;adoes behind tho&s;e that were burnt the day be|fore, we were con&s;trained to de&s;i&s;t. The Pri&s;oners which our <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> brought to the Camp, report that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was extreamly enraged again&s;t the Commander of the <HI>Spahi</HI>'s, for not having done his Duty, in for&s;aking the <HI>Jani&s;aries:</HI> to which they added, That of ten thou&s;and that were employed in the Attempt, very few were return'd to the Camp.</P>
<P>The 18th. Two great Mines were &s;prung in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> At|tack; but neither did that Execution which our Miners expect|ed, which much retarded the Reduction of the Place. There|upon
<PB N="54" REF="30">the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> finding &s;o little progre&s;s made by the Miners, was re&s;olved upon the <HI>Sapp;</HI> and to that effect great Preparations were made of Bavins, Sacks of Earth, and the like, to fill up the Trench; and certain Engins were likewi&s;e contriv'd to approach the Enemy with le&s;s danger, and to drive them from their Po&s;ts. There was al&s;o a new Battery rai&s;ed to cut off the Pali&s;adoes of the Be&s;ieged with chained Bullets. This day a De&s;erter came from the Turki&s;h Army, who informed us that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was encamped at <HI>Ert&s;chin,</HI> four Leagues from our Camp; but that however he had not given over his de&s;ign of &s;uccouring the Be&s;ieged; and that he Retreated only for want of Forrage. This day the <HI>Bavarians</HI> al&s;o &s;eized a Country-man, who had &s;wam cro&s;s the <HI>Danaw,</HI> with Letters from the Gover|nour of <HI>Buda</HI> for the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> wherein he conjured him by the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to Relieve him; adding, that he would hold out to the la&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>The 19th. The Enemy being thus re&s;olved to hold out to the la&s;t ga&s;p, fired all the day long with their Artillery upon the new Battery rai&s;ed in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack, to beat down the Pa|li&s;adoes fixed upon the Breaches, upon which were planted four Pieces of Canon, and made it un&s;erviceable; &s;o that we were forced to &s;tay till night before we could repair it. The De|tachments of the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Army alarm'd us every night; &s;o that for the greater &s;ecurity of our Camp, we had always &s;ome Regiments upon the Guard, to prevent the De&s;ings of the Ene|my, and to be ready upon all Occa&s;ions. Moreover, it was ve|rily thought that &s;o &s;oon as General <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI> &s;hould arrive in the Camp with his Body of men out of <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> where he had garri&s;on'd &s;ome Ca&s;tles, that the Duke would attack the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> in his Camp, who, by the Report of all the Pri&s;oners and De&s;erters, was not above &s;ix and forty thou&s;and men, of which the one half were forc'd and undi&s;ciplin'd Men. In the mean time he was very vigilant to &s;end out con&s;iderable Parties to ob&s;erve the Motion of the Enemy, who every foot meeting with the Turks, gain'd every day &s;ome remarkable Advantage over 'em.</P>
<P>The 20th. The Grand Vizier de&s;irous once more to try to put Relief into <HI>Buda,</HI> re&s;olved to attempt with a le&s;&s;er Body than before, that he might not be &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;covered, and might approach our Camp before we had notice of it. To this pur|po&s;e he made choice of the &s;toute&s;t Officers of his Army, who
<PB N="55" REF="30">promi&s;ed to obey his Commands, or peri&s;h in the Attempt. The&s;e Men &s;et forward in the Night time with two thou&s;and <HI>Spahi's,</HI> and an equal number of <HI>Jani&s;eries</HI> for the more &s;peed. And this morning by break of day they appeared in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Valley. Where having put them&s;elves in order without being perceived, they came thundring upon our Out-Guards with loud Cries and terrible Yelling, and having ea&s;ily forc'd them, fell upon two Squadrons of <HI>Caprara</HI>'s and <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI>'s Cavalrie, who received 'em briskly, and gave opportunity to others to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and repel the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> who fled as fa&s;t as their Hor&s;es Heels could carry them. The <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> al&s;o, &s;ome of whom were already alighted, with an Intention to break through our Lines and get into the City, were very cour&s;ely entertain'd, be|ing pur&s;u'd by General <HI>Heu&s;ler</HI> to the very Gate, and met by the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Hor&s;e-Guard, who came running in upon the Ala|rum; &s;o that the Slaughter of the Enemy was very great, and very few had the good Luck to enter the City. For tho' &s;ome will have them to be a hundred and fifty, hardly a hundred had that good Fortune, which it was ea&s;y to judg by the Hor&s;es that were quitted, which exceeded not the &s;ame number, and be&s;ides a good part of them were wounded too by the Musket &s;hot of our Souldiers in the Approaches, by which there was a nece&s;&s;ity for 'em to pa&s;s. And indeed had the Out-Guards done their Duty, not a <HI>Turk</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed our Lines. The Enemy had above four hundred &s;lain; and of our Men there were about fifteen &s;lain, and twenty &s;even wounded. General <HI>Heu&s;ler,</HI> who behaved him|&s;elf with an extraordinary Gallantry, received a Wound in the Foot, but not dangerous; but General <HI>Maigret</HI> was very much cut and mangled with a Scirnitar. The Marque&s;s <HI>Santini,</HI> Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> and Captain in <HI>Salleburgh</HI>'s Regiment, was taken Pri|&s;oner in the fir&s;t On&s;et. And now the Be&s;ieged to te&s;tify their Joy for the Relief they had received, hung out three red Colours in &s;ign of Victory, and fir'd three Rounds of all their great and &s;mall Shot. During the Combat &s;ome Squadrons of Hor&s;e of the Grand Vizier's Army, who had followed the re&s;t, to &s;econd them if Occa&s;ion were, &s;hew'd them&s;elves in Battel Array to the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, making a &s;hew as if they intended to try their Fortune on that &s;ide, but they retired without enterprizing any thing. But at ten a Clock at Night they returned again to the &s;ame place where they had attempted to break through in the Morning; but were repul&s;ed by our Men, and retired in Confu|&s;ion.
<PB N="56" REF="31">Within the Lines, the <HI>Bavarians</HI> rai&s;ed a new Battery of four pieces of Cannon in their Attack, and the Be&s;ieged planted a whole Cannon upon the high Wall of the Ca&s;tle, with which they battered all the Covert way, as al&s;o the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Battery upon the great Roundel.</P>
<P>The 21&s;t. This Morning a Redoubt was rai&s;ed in that part which the <HI>Turks</HI> forced the day before, planted with two pieces of Cannon, and &s;trengthened with a &s;ufficient Force to defend the Pa&s;|&s;age. Another Redoubt was al&s;o rai&s;ed upon the Hill upon the left hand, where <HI>Lodron</HI>'s Regiment encamped. This day the Be|&s;ieged fired &s;ome Rounds of great Guns in token of Joy, tho' we could not gue&s;s the rea&s;on, unle&s;s it were for the Celebration of &s;ome Fe&s;tival. This day al&s;o the Sieur <HI>Rummel,</HI> General of the <HI>Ba|varian</HI> Forces, being in the Approaches, was killed with a Mu&s;|ket Shot. He was very much lamented, as being an Officer who all along had given mo&s;t &s;ignal Proofs of his martial Va|lor, and fought di&s;tingui&s;hed upon all Occa&s;ions, where he might win Honour.</P>
<P>The 22d. This Morning the Elector cau&s;ed an A&s;&s;ault to be given to the great Tower, which is in the middle of the Ca&s;tle, and which our Artillery had for the mo&s;t part ruin'd; and made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it after an hours Di&s;pute, which co&s;t us the lo&s;s of &s;eventy three men, and as many wounded, among whom was Duke <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Saxon-Mersbergh.</HI> During this A&s;&s;ault there was a fal&s;e Alarum given in the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack to divert the E|nemy; and the great Guns fired with great Fury upon the De|fences which the Enemy had rai&s;ed upon the Breaches of the in|ner Wall. This Evening about ten a Clock a <HI>Turk</HI> was appre|hended, who having got out of the Town by &s;wimming the Ri|ver, travelled all along the Banks of the <HI>Danaw;</HI> and was got as far as St. <HI>Margetts</HI> I&s;land, where being perceived, he threw his Letters into the River, but neverthele&s;s confe&s;&s;ed that he was di&s;|patched by the Governor to inform the Grand Vizier of the Condition of the Place, and to pre&s;s Relief: Adding withal that there was another got out upon the &s;ame Errand.</P>
<P>The 23d. The Be&s;ieged made an Attempt to recover the great Tower of the Ca&s;tle, which the <HI>Elector</HI>'s Forces had won the day before; but they were repul&s;ed, and pur&s;ued to their In|trenchments. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack four pieces of Cannon were planted upon the old great Battery, with which they began to batter the new Pali&s;adoes upon the Breach of the inner Wall.
<PB N="57" REF="31">La&s;t night the Be&s;ieged made a Salley upon the <HI>Saxons</HI> Quarter but were &s;o &s;martly received and repul&s;ed by Lieutenant Co|lonel <HI>Pletze,</HI> who was upon the Guard with a hundred Hor&s;e, that they had much ado to regain their &s;econd Wall, where this Officer was &s;lain with two Mu&s;quet-&s;hots, the one in his &s;ide, and the other in his head.</P>
<P>The 24th. This morning the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hewed them&s;elves in two di&s;tinct Bodies, one upon the <HI>Lorrain,</HI> and the other next the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, but without making any attempt they Retreated about Noon to their Camp, which they had removed about a League nearer to ours than it was before. This day a De&s;erter a&s;&s;ured us, that the Be&s;ieged began to talk with a great deal of liberty again&s;t the Governour, who neverthele&s;s endeavoured all he could to retain them in their Duty; a&s;&s;uring them that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> daily expected in his Camp one of the chief Mini&s;ters at the <HI>Port,</HI> called <HI>Michtakis,</HI> with full power from the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> to treat and conclude a Peace with the Generals of the Chri&s;tian Army: and that upon his arrival there would be a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Arms; exhorting 'em not to degenerate at la&s;t from the Gallantry and Vertue of true <HI>Mu&s;&s;el-men,</HI> who&s;e Honour they had hitherto &s;o generou&s;ly maintained, and to tarry a few days longer, before they talk'd of a Surrender.</P>
<P>The 25. The D. of <HI>Lorrain</HI> being inform'd the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> might find a Pa&s;&s;age on the &s;ide of the <HI>Danaw,</HI> behind the hot Bathes, to put a Re-inforcement into the City, ordered that there &s;hould be every night &s;ome Squadrons of Hor&s;e ready to &s;econd the Guards, which &s;hould be likewi&s;e doubled; and to render the Pa&s;&s;age more difficult for the <HI>Turks</HI> to force, he cau&s;ed Pali&s;a|does to be fixed in the weaker and mo&s;t defencele&s;s places, and cau&s;ed certain <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Hungarian</HI> Squadrons and Battalions to be there po&s;ted, in &s;uch a manner, that if the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hould make any attempt el&s;ewhere, they might &s;till be ready with Re|lief whereever the Alarm called. There was al&s;o &s;ome alteration made in two Batteries, the better to endamage the Be&s;ieged, and overturn their Parapets, Pali&s;adoes, and other Defences, which they had rai&s;ed upon the Breach of the inner Wall. The <HI>Ba|varians</HI> were forced to win their ground inch by inch, nor could they as yet make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the whole Ca&s;tle; &s;uch was the Oppo&s;ition of a &s;tout and daring Enemy, who did not lo&s;e a foot of Ground, but what he &s;ought to regain by &s;everal Efforts, making u&s;e to that purpo&s;e of Bombs, Granadoes, Stones, Powder-bags, and all tho&s;e other means that Courage
<PB N="58" REF="32">or De&s;pair were capable to invent to the De&s;truction of the A&s;|&s;ailants. In&s;omuch that it co&s;t no &s;mall labour, as fa&s;t as we gained Ground, to fill up the Holes and Caverns which the Ene|my had hollow'd in the Earth for our ruin; which had it not been done, we had never kept our Stations.</P>
<P>The 26th. The Pri&s;oners which our Parties brought to the Camp, as well as &s;ome De&s;erters gave us Information, that one of the Me&s;|&s;engers which the Governour had &s;ent to the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> was &s;afely arriv'd at the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Camp, and had deliver'd him the Governor's Letters, wherein he gave him an account of the Condi|tion of the place, that he could not hold out much longer; that the Chri&s;tians were Ma&s;ters of the Ca&s;tle, and that the next A&s;|&s;ault would &s;urely carry the Place; that at the la&s;t A&s;&s;ault of the Ca&s;tle he had lo&s;t above an hundred of his be&s;t Soldiers; that the la&s;t Re-inforcement was very incon&s;iderable, as not amounting to two hundred men, of which the one half were wounded and unfit for Service; that for his part he had done his duty, in let|ting the Chri&s;tians know by a Defence &s;o ob&s;tinate, during &s;o long a Siege, carried on with &s;o much fury and bravery on both &s;ides, that the <HI>Mu&s;&s;el-men</HI> knew how to defend their <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Glo|ry, of which he claimed to have merited the Honour: Prote&s;t|ing at length that it lay at the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s door to give an account for the ill Succe&s;s of the Siege, and that he was only to be re&s;pon&s;able for the lo&s;s &s;o con&s;iderable, which could not be avoided, if the <HI>Imperiali&s;ts</HI> attempted one more A&s;&s;ault; as al&s;o for the Blood of his valiant Soldiers, and his own, if he any longer delayed Relief. In the &s;ame Letter the Governour de|&s;cribed to the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> the Place mo&s;t proper for him to at|tempt, which was &s;o little dreamt of, that if he ordered his Bu|&s;ine&s;s as he ought to do, he could not fail in his Enterprize. Up|on which Intelligence the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> vi&s;ited him&s;elf the Place mark'd out by the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> to make the Attempt, and put all things in order to prevent the Enemies De&s;ign. The Spies which were &s;ent to the Enemies Camp, reported, That the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> had promi&s;ed forty Crowns apiece to tho&s;e that would undertake to put them&s;elves into the Town, promi&s;ing moreover, that during their Lives, they &s;hould be exempt from going to the Wars, and yet &s;hould enjoy their u&s;ual Pay con&s;tant|ly without doing any duty. About Noon we had Intelligence that the Enemy advanced with twelve Pieces of Canon, and pre&s;ently after they appeared within view of our Camp, drawn up in Bat|tel Array: However no &s;ooner had the Duke Mar&s;hal'd our Ar|my
<PB N="59" REF="32">in a Condition ready to oppo&s;e 'em, but they retreated again.</P>
<P>The 27th. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack was fini&s;hed a certain piece of Workman&s;hip like a Bridge, which was to be run along up|on Wheels to the Enemies Pali&s;ado's in the time of the On&s;et: It was covered with Earth to prevent firing, as the day before they had fired &s;ome Wooden-works of the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> which con&s;train'd 'em to recoil; but this Morning they recovered their former Po&s;ts, and to guard them&s;elves from the Fire, made u&s;e of Planks covered with Tin: But when they thought them&s;elves &s;afe from that devouting Element, the Enemy no le&s;s indu&s;trious to de&s;troy than they to pre&s;erve, flung down in the Evening &s;uch an infinite Quantity of Pitch, Tar, Sulphur, and other combu&s;tible Materials, with that Succe&s;s, that the Fire got to the Planks, and reduc'd 'em to A&s;hes. At the &s;ame time they al&s;o ca&s;t down &s;uch an infinite Quantity of Granado's, Stones, and Arrows up|on the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> that they were con&s;train'd a &s;econd time to quit their Po&s;ts with the lo&s;s of twenty Soldiers.</P>
<P>The 28th. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attack they did nothing but bat|ter the Flanks of the great Breach, as did al&s;o the <HI>Brandenburgh|ers,</HI> to overturn the Defences of the Enemy. So that at length the <HI>Bavarians</HI> recovered their Po&s;t, and &s;ecured it &s;o well that it was not in the power of the Enemy to di&s;lodge 'em any more. Serjeant Major <HI>Stuben,</HI> of the Regiment of <HI>Sebol&s;torff,</HI> who com|manded the A&s;&s;ailants, was &s;lain, with &s;ome common Soldiers; tho' both &s;lain and wounded, did not exceed the number of twenty. Upon the Report of &s;ome De&s;erters, that the grand Vizier was re|&s;olv'd this night to attack us with all his Forces, the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> prepared all things in a Readine&s;s to receive him, and all the Army &s;tood to their Armes in Battalia; but to no pur|po&s;e, for no Enemy appeared.</P>
<P>The 29th. Being the Day of St. <HI>John</HI>'s beheading, which the <HI>Turks,</HI> out of a fooli&s;h piece of Super&s;tition, have always look'd up|on as a day au&s;picious to their Empire, a thou&s;and <HI>Spahi</HI>'s, and two thou&s;and <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> under the command of two <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s, and &s;econded by fifteen hundred <HI>Tartars,</HI> came to try their Fortune on that &s;ide next the Water, but finding tho&s;e Po&s;ts too well provided, and having been &s;aluted with a volley of &s;mall Shot, they retired in great ha&s;t, and thought it more proper to try to break through in that part where the la&s;t Reinforcement had for|ced their way. In &s;hort an hour after they appeared in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Valley, and with terrible Outcries and Yells came thundring up|on the Hor&s;e Regiments of <HI>Mercy, Heu&s;ler,</HI> and <HI>Neuburgh,</HI> who re|ceiv'd
<PB N="60" REF="33">'em with that Gallantry, that they &s;lew a great number of tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> of whom &s;ome were &s;o fool-hardy as to throw them&s;elves into our Lines, where they were all cut to pieces, except 4. who were &s;o fortunate as to get into the Town. We reckoned a|bove 600. <HI>Turks</HI> that were &s;lain in this Action, be&s;ides the Pri|&s;oners, which are not very many. There were al&s;o taken 25. Co|lors of Hor&s;e and Foot, all Red, to &s;ignifie that they would either enter the Town or dye. On our &s;ide there were not above 30. &s;lain and wounded, among which latter was General <HI>Mercy,</HI> having receiv'd two Cuts with a Scimitar, one in the Head, and the other in the Shoulder, tho' nothing dangerous; but his Adjutant-Gene|ral was &s;lain. During the heat of this Action, the Be&s;ieged made a Sally upon the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack; but the <HI>Heydukes</HI> a&s;&s;ailing 'em in Flanck, they had much ado to retire with the lo&s;s of 17. killed upon the Place. All this day the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> &s;hewed him&s;elf on the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Quarters, ready to try the Fortune of a Battle, but perceiving the Arrival of General <HI>Picolomini</HI> in our Camp, with three Regiments of Cuira&s;&s;iers, and two of Dragoons, being the Vanguard of General <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI>'s Body, he retreated in great ha&s;t to his Camp.</P>
<P>The 30th. General <HI>Picolomini</HI> arriving ye&s;terday with the Re|giments of <HI>Saxon Lawenburgh, Picolomini,</HI> St. <HI>Croix, Tettwin,</HI> and <HI>Magni,</HI> making in all 25. Squadrons, was this day followed by Lieu|tenant-General <HI>Scherffenbergh</HI> with the re&s;t of his Body, compo|&s;ed of the Foot Regiments of <HI>Veterani, Getz, Sereni, Spinola,</HI> and <HI>Scherffenberg,</HI> all lu&s;ty proper Men, and well di&s;ciplin'd. The De&s;erters al&s;o a&s;&s;ur'd us that there was a great Scarcity in the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI>'s Army, and that the Souldiers half &s;tarved, had pil|laged certain Barks that brought Provi&s;ions for <HI>Buda,</HI> their Officers not being able to prevent it. The 31th. In the <HI>Lorrain</HI> Attacque a new Po&s;t was taken in the Trench before the Breach of the Inner Wall, which is not above three Fadom di&s;tance from the Pali&s;a|do's of the Be&s;ieged; and in regard the place was very deep, the <HI>Turks</HI> could not annoy us; &s;o that we had not above two men wounded. This Morning the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> accompany'd with all the re&s;t of the Generals, went over to the Elector's Quarters, where he held a Council of War, and after Dinner the Duke re|turn'd to his own Quarters, where he order'd the Works to be enlarg'd and deepn'd, that they might with le&s;s difficulty go on to the General Affault, which was then intended within a day or two.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 1. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;hewed them&s;elves before day by the light of
<PB N="61" REF="33">the Moon near the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Attack, to the number of 3000 Hor&s;e and Foot; but perceiving our men to be in good order, and ready to receive 'em, they retired without making any attempt. Ye|&s;terday the Grand Chancellor, the Count <HI>de Straatman,</HI> being ar|rived at the Camp, with a private Commi&s;&s;ion from the Emperor, he cau&s;ed a Council of War to be call'd, where were pre&s;ent the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and all the Generals, both Imperiali&s;ts and Auxiliaries. The Chancellor then produ|ced his Commi&s;&s;ion, to this effect; That his Imperial Maje&s;ty earne&s;tly de&s;iring an end of that bloody Siege, they were to con|&s;ult the mo&s;t proper and expedient means to do it. Thereupon two Points were propo&s;ed; Whether to fight the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> with the greate&s;t part of the Army, leaving a &s;ufficient Force to guard the Lines; or, whether to give a general A&s;&s;ault to the Place with a greater Force than had yet been made u&s;e of to that purpo&s;e. Which latter Propo&s;al was concluded upon by the great|e&s;t part of the Generals, and &s;o a general A&s;&s;ault being concluded upon the next day, all things were prepared in a readine&s;s, that the Blow might not fail; and to keep the Enemy in ignorance, a Rumor was &s;pread abroad in the Camp, That the next day the General intended to give the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> Battel, which cau&s;ed great re|joycing among the Officers and Soldiers, who de&s;ired nothing more than to &s;ignalize their Valour. Neverthele&s;s they forbore not to play all the day long from all the Batteries to widen the Breaches, and beat down the Enemies Defences.</P>
<P>The 2d. All the Generals got on Hor&s;eback, and the Army was drawn up ready to quit the Lines, and march to the grand Pa|rade, from thence to march toward the <HI>Grand Vizier.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and the Elector vi&s;ited every Quarter, encouraging the Officers and Soldiers valiantly to maintain the Cau&s;e of God and the Emperor's Honour. In the mean time the Infantry rang'd them&s;elves in their &s;everal Battalions, the great Guns were fired with re-doubled Fury from all the three Attacks, and an infinite number of Bombs and chain'd Shot were thundred again&s;t the De|fences of the Be&s;ieged. But when the Army was ju&s;t ready to march toward the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> of a &s;uddain the whole order of the March was chang'd, and about three a Clock in the after|noon the Rean-Guard was commanded to mount the Breaches, all things being &s;o provided before hand, that without di&s;turbing the Order of the Battalions, they might fall on. Which they did in three &s;everal Places; <HI>viz.</HI> In the <HI>Lorrain, Bavarian,</HI> and <HI>Bran|denburghers</HI> Attacks: be&s;ides other fal&s;e Attacks premeditated to
<PB N="62" REF="34">divert the Enemy: But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Precautions to render the A&s;&s;ault more ea&s;ie, &s;uch was the ob&s;tinate Re&s;i&s;tance, that they had much ado to prevail. They defended them&s;elves a|bove three quarters of an hour with their Halbards, Half-pikes, and Parti&s;ans, and &s;lung &s;uch an infinite quantity of Stones, Arrows and Granadoes, that they repul&s;ed us vigorou&s;ly more than once: but at length our men, encouraged by the Pre&s;ence of their Ge|nerals, returned to the A&s;&s;ault with greater Fury, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Breaches in all the three Attacks. The <HI>Turks</HI> defended them&s;elves, retreating from Entrenchment to En|trenchment, &s;o that the &s;laughter was very bloody: for our Soldi|ers having driven the <HI>Turks</HI> from their Defences, entred the City by main force, over-run the Streets, put all to the Sword that en|countred their Fury, &s;paring neither Sex nor Age, &s;o that there was nothing el&s;e to be &s;een but the dead Bodies of the &s;lain. The <HI>Bavarians</HI> al&s;o pur&s;ued their Advantage, and fell upon a thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> who were retired to a little Fort at the Foot of the Ca&s;tle, where they defended them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t, till at length de&s;pairing of their Safety, they hung out a white Flag, and begg'd for Quarter. Which, con&s;idering their ob&s;tinacy, and the &s;laugh|ter they had made of our men, the Duke and the Elector were at fir&s;t unwilling to grant; but recollecting afterwards that their num|ber was great, that they might do us more mi&s;chief, that Night drew on; that the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> was at hand with a Formidable Army, that the Soldiers were tired and wanted repo&s;e, and that the City was on Fire in &s;everal places, they re&s;olv'd to give them their Lives; of which when the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures were a&s;&s;u|red, they flung down their Arms and yielded at di&s;cretion. There were about a thou&s;and <HI>Turks</HI> more, who being retired into Caves and Caverns, obtained the &s;ame favour. The number of the Bar|barians that were &s;lain, amounted to above 3000. be&s;ides the wound|ed, which were not many: &s;o that it appears the Garri&s;on was much &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nger than the De&s;erters reported. The Governour <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> dy'd bravely upon the the Breach, where he defended him&s;elf va|liantly with his Scimiter in his hand, &s;corning to Retreat or de|mand Quarter, that he might not degenerate from the Honour and Heroic Vertue of the ancient <HI>Mu&s;&s;el men,</HI> nor fal&s;ifie the Oath which he had made the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> either to pre&s;erve the Town, or gloriou&s;ly to end his days. The <HI>Vice Ba&s;ha,</HI> being an Of|ficer of high Reputation, defended the Ca&s;tle, but perceiving all was lo&s;t, retir'd fighting into the fore-mentioned Fort at the foot of the Ca&s;tle, which he thought to make good, and give the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI>
<PB N="63" REF="34">lei&s;ure to relieve him; but &s;eeing the de&s;perate condition of Af|fairs, he rather cho&s;e to implore the clemency of the Victors, than to occa&s;ion the Ma&s;&s;acre of tho&s;e that were about him, and &s;o was taken Pri&s;oner with the re&s;t by the <HI>Bavarians,</HI> and pre&s;ented to his Electoral Highne&s;s. The <HI>Aga</HI> of the Jani&s;aries taken by the Im|periali&s;ts, was delivered up to the <HI>D.</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> with &s;ome o|ther Turki&s;h Officers of note. So that the number of the Pri&s;on|ers did not much exceed 2000. Men, of 13000. at the beginning of the Siege, all &s;tout and experienc'd Soldiers, and the very &s;i|news of the Militia of all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. The lo&s;s on our &s;ide was very &s;mall, compar'd with that of the Enemies. For we cannot reckon above 400. kill'd, and about 200. wounded, among whom were &s;everal Volunteers, but very few Officers, Colonel <HI>Spinola,</HI> Marque&s;s of <HI>Arquato,</HI> an Officer of great merit, receiv'd his death's wound at the head of the A&s;&s;ailants; &amp; the Ba|ron of <HI>A&s;ti,</HI> who had been twice wounded before, during the Siege, receiv'd a third wound more dangerous than any of the former, to the great hazard of his life. The booty which the Soldiers got was extraordinary, there being a va&s;t deal of Wealth in the City, which the Inhabitants of other Cities and Places under the domi|nion of the <HI>Turk</HI> had brought thither for Security, as being a place which they thought impregnable. There was found in the Town, Ammunition and Provi&s;ion &s;ufficient for a Siege of two Months longer; a Magazine furni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Arms Of|fen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive for above 30000.

It is impo&s;&s;ible to give you an Inventory of every thing; 'twill be e|nough to &s;ay, that never any City could be better provided to &s;u&s;tain a vigorous Siege, than this was; or ever was defended by a &s;touter Garri&s;on. But if the re&s;i&s;tance met with, were &s;o &s;urprizing, much more mu&s;t be the Glory of &s;o many brave Of|ficers, Volunteers, and Soldiers, that &s;ignalized their valour, and eternized, not only their own Memories, but the Honour of the Emperor, in gaining &s;uch a &s;trong hold, and recovering it into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, to whom it belongs by right of Nature and Succe&s;&s;ion; and which had endured &s;o many Sieges, before it could be reduced under the Subjection of its Lawful Sovereign.</P>

<PB N="64" REF="35">
<P>The D. of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> after he had prevented any farther &s;laugh|ter, and given all nece&s;&s;ary orders to reduce the Soldiers under their Colours, commanded the People to quench the fire that continu'd burning in &s;everal parts, gave the Government of the place to General <HI>Beek,</HI> with a Garri&s;on of 5000. Foot, and 1000. Hor&s;e, till his Imperial Maje&s;ty &s;hould otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of the ab&s;olute Government of this Imperial City; and command|ed between 8 and 10000 Cuira&s;&s;iers and Dragoons, with the <HI>Hu&s;&s;ars</HI> under Count <HI>Budiani</HI> to pur&s;ue the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> who having look'd on, and &s;een the taking of <HI>Buda,</HI> decamp'd with his whole Army to &s;ecure the re&s;t of the Turki&s;h Fortre&s;&s;es, to reinforce the Garri&s;ons, and gain the Bridge of <HI>E&s;&s;eck,</HI> where our General is re&s;olv'd to attack him, if he can overtake him in his march. To which purpo&s;e the Infantry was embark'd upon the <HI>Danaw,</HI> to make the more ha&s;t, while the Cavalry march'd by Land.</P>
<P>Thus was this great and &s;trong City, the Capital City of all <HI>Hungary,</HI> the &s;eat of the Ancient Kings, reduced under the Obe|dience of our mo&s;t Illu&s;trious and Invincible Emperour <HI>Leopold</HI> the fir&s;t, after it had groaned under the Tyrannous Yoke of the <HI>Ottomans</HI> a hundred forty five years, who made u&s;e of it as a place of Rendezvous for their Armies, and a Magazine to furni&s;h all the other Cities in tho&s;e parts under their &s;ubjection, with Men and Ammunition, to which purpo&s;e they always furni&s;hed it with a numerous Garri&s;on, never con&s;i&s;ting of le&s;s than between 8 and 10000 Jani&s;aries and Spain's, whether in Peace or War. And though Sultan <HI>Solyman</HI> won this important place from King <HI>Fer|dinand,</HI> Brother to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, in the year 1529. through the treachery of the <HI>Hungarian</HI> Garri&s;on; never|thele&s;s he put it into the hand of <HI>John Zapolilia,</HI> Prince of <HI>Tran|&s;ilvania,</HI> who had call'd him to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance to pre&s;erve him in the Throne, to which he had been advanc'd by Sedition, and con|trary to Form, by a part of the Nobility, after the death of King <HI>Lewis</HI> &s;lain at the Battle of <HI>Mohaes,</HI> contrary to the Procla|mation of the real King <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> duly elected by the four Or|ders of the States of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>This U&s;urper being thus confirm'd in the enjoyment of one part of the Kingdom, and of the Capital City under the Prote|ction of the <HI>Turks,</HI> King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;ent his General Count <HI>Rog|gendorff,</HI> who had &s;o valiantly defended <HI>Vienna,</HI> under the Command of the Elector Palatine, again&s;t the efforts of <HI>Solyman,</HI> to lay Siege to <HI>Buda;</HI> but he was con&s;train'd to rai&s;e his Siege,
<PB N="65" REF="35">after he had lo&s;t a great part of his Army. General <HI>Fel&s;ius</HI> was &s;ent thither 10. years after. But that Enterpri&s;e &s;ucceeded no better tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> the former; notwith&s;tanding the Death of the U&s;ur|per <HI>Zapolia,</HI> and the Minority of his Son <HI>John Sigi&s;mund,</HI> who was under the Tutelage of the Prince&s;s <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> his Mother, and <HI>George Martinu&s;ius,</HI> chief Mini&s;ter of State to his decea&s;ed Father. However King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> was no way di&s;cou|raged by the&s;e two un&s;ucce&s;sful Attempts, but con&s;idering the Im|portance of the Place for the Support of his Crown, re&s;olv'd upon a third Attempt. To which purpo&s;e he rai&s;ed a more numerous Army than before, and gave the Command of it to <HI>Roggendorff,</HI> who the next Year laid a third Siege to <HI>Buda,</HI> and had made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, if <HI>Solyman,</HI> at the Sollicitation of the Prince&s;s <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> had not ha&s;tned to his Relief; which con&s;trained the Gene|ral to rai&s;e his Siege, not being able to make head again&s;t &s;uch a numerous Army of the Infidels. Thereupon the Sultan politick|ly &s;eized upon the City of <HI>Buda,</HI> &s;ent the young Prince <HI>John Si|gi&s;mund,</HI> with the Prince&s;s his Mother, into <HI>Tran&s;ilvania,</HI> and kept the Town in his own Hands, with a Re&s;olution never to re|&s;tore it, notwith&s;tanding his public Declaration to keep it only during the Minority of the Prince. And to that intent he filled it with a &s;trong Garri&s;on of his own Men, the choice&s;t in his Army, under the Command of a <HI>Beglerbeg,</HI> or <HI>Vice Roy,</HI> who&s;e Authori|ty extends over all the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI>'s of <HI>Hungary.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it was that this Royal City has been ever &s;ince in &s;ubje|ction to the <HI>Ottoman Empire.</HI> The Marque&s;s of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> had|form'd a de&s;ign upon <HI>Buda</HI> in the Year 1542. but having in vain a&s;&s;aulted the City of <HI>Pe&s;t,</HI> which is &s;eparated from it only by the <HI>Danaw,</HI> he retreated without making the lea&s;t Attempt upon the Capital City: So that this Expedition is not to be lookt upon as a Siege, as &s;ome would erroneou&s;ly have it to be. Count <HI>Smarzen|burgh</HI> be&s;ieg'd it in the Year 1598. but was con&s;train'd to rai&s;e his Siege after he had lain thirty days before it, by rea&s;on of the con|tinual Rains when the Year was too far &s;pent. In the Year 1602. General <HI>Ro&s;wourm</HI> lay before it with the Imperial Army, and at|tacqu'd it in vain. Nor was the fatal day for this Place langui&s;h|ingunder the Tyranny of the <HI>Turks,</HI> yet come in the Year 1684. when the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> fir&s;t attacked it. For God had ordain'd the 2d. of <HI>Septemb.</HI> 1686. (the day when it was taken by <HI>Soly|man</HI>) to be the day of his Triumph, when it was again wre&s;ted from the Hands of the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> after this &s;ame 7th. Siege had been carried on with that Heat, Con&s;tancy, Prudence, and Con|duct
<PB N="66" REF="36">of the Couragious D. of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> no le&s;s eminent for all the forementioned Vertues, and &s;everal other Generals of the Emperor, and his Auxiliaries, una|nimou&s;ly con&s;piring the Regaining of this Place, that we have rea&s;on to hope for Conque&s;ts far more Glorious, and more Con|&s;iderable for the Advancement of the Cau&s;e of God, Advance|ment of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Family, and con&s;olation of &s;o great a num|ber of Chri&s;tian Souls as groan'd under the Tyrannous Yoak of Infidels, and the Recovery of an infinite number of <HI>Barbarians</HI> in|to the Bo&s;om of the true Church of God.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have heretofore experienced the Valour of <HI>Huniades</HI> and <HI>Scanderbergh,</HI> who were the Scourges of tho&s;e barbarous Peo|ple: They have trembled at the Courage and Conduct of the D. of <HI>Merceur,</HI> to that degree, that the Grand Signior threaten'd a Rupture with <HI>France,</HI> if the King would not recall him out of the Emperor's Service. They have been apprehen&s;ive of the Pro|gre&s;s of the Valiant Count <HI>Serini,</HI> and &s;everal other famous Cap|tains, every where attended by their good Fortune. But much more Rea&s;on have they to be a&s;toni&s;hed at the Heroic Virtues of our undaunted and martial D. of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> who &s;eems to have been born for the Subver&s;ion of the Mahometan Law, and with whom no Per&s;on living can di&s;pute the Honour of being the greate&s;t Captain of his Age, and the Terror of the <HI>Mu&s;&s;elmen;</HI> who knows not what it is to lo&s;e a Battel, and who may &s;ay with the Invin|cible Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> V. when he &s;wam cro&s;s the <HI>Elb,</HI> vanqui&s;h'd and took Pri&s;oner <HI>Frederic</HI> D. of <HI>Saxony,</HI> crying out, <HI>Veni, vidi, Deus vicit.</HI> For in all Encounters whereever he engaged, during this Holy War, he has miraculou&s;ly triumphed o're his Ene|mies, and born away the Victory. He it was, who during the Seige of <HI>Vienna,</HI> &s;urpriz'd and overcame near <HI>Presburgh</HI> the Re|bellious Army of Perfidious <HI>Teckley,</HI> Reinforced with a Body of <HI>Turks</HI> under the Command of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ein-Ba&s;ha.</HI> He it was that de|feated the <HI>Turks</HI> near <HI>Calenburgh,</HI> and con&s;train'd the Grand Vi|zier di&s;honourably to rai&s;e his Siege from before <HI>Vienna.</HI> He it was that vanqui&s;hed the Enemy near <HI>Barkan,</HI> and re&s;cu'd the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and the Prince his Son, when they were both in iminent Danger, and the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army in Confu&s;ion. He it was that during the Siege of <HI>Buda</HI> three times defeated the Sera&s;quier's Army: Who during the Siege of <HI>Newhau&s;el</HI> relieved the City of <HI>Gran,</HI> and routed the Army of <HI>Zeitan Ibraim Ba&s;&s;a.</HI> And la&s;tly, he it was who won this glorious Conque&s;t, while the Grand Vizi|er <HI>Solyman</HI> looked on with a potent Army of <HI>Barbarians,</HI> twice
<PB N="67" REF="36">or thrice beat his Succors, and tho' at length he came up with all his Forces again&s;t our Lines, gave a general A&s;&s;ault, and by main Force carried this Important Place, guarded &s;till by above 5000. fighting Men; So that it is de&s;ervedly &s;aid of him,</P>
<Q><P>EXPVLIT EX BVDA TVRCAM.</P>
<P><HI>He drave the Turk out of</HI> Buda.</P></Q>
<P>The Conque&s;ts made in <HI>Turkie</HI> are the price of &s;o many Victo|ries, and will doubtle&s;s be attended with many more by the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of the God of Battels, who has hitherto favour'd and ble&s;s'd the victorious Arms of our thrice Illu&s;trious Monarch, under the Conduct of &s;o great a Captain, defcended from the Noble Stock of &s;o many Illu&s;trious Hero's, and particularly from the warlike Conqueror of the Holy Land, <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloign,</HI> who&s;e &s;teps he treads &s;o gloriou&s;ly, that if the Chri&s;tian Princes would but a&s;|&s;i&s;t him with their Forces, and act unanimou&s;ly with him, he might with ea&s;e regain the Kingdom of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> his ancient Patrimony, which the Infidels wre&s;ted from his Ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>Would it might plea&s;e Divine Providence that now the time were come to humble the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, which according to the Progno&s;tications of the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves, has not long to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, it being a Prediction currant among 'em, <HI>That the City of</HI> Con&s;tan|tinople <HI>having been taken by one</HI> Mahomet, <HI>will be re-taken by the Chri&s;tians under the Raign of another</HI> Mahomet. God grant that this may happen under Him at pre&s;ent, who by the lo&s;s of <HI>Buda</HI> has lo&s;t the Key of all his Empire. Nor will it be ami&s;s to add in this place the following Epigram, made by an ingenious Per&s;on upon this Subject.</P>
