<P>_BEing well assured that this your worke (out of your owne protection) would in the end present it selfe to the generall view; and likely enough some one that loues you not so much, nor knowes you at all, might haue the passing of it: I haue put my selfe in the way of your reproofe; and am become a theese of this nature, to steale no more from you then I will againe giue to you. If I could perswade you there were a fault in modesty, you would bid me publish the vertue which you tye vp in too straight bonds. My fault is, I haue done that which would haue beene done; and the offer is so full of loue, that it lookes for a punishment accordingly.</P>

<HEAD>THE SVRVEY OF THE great Dukes State of <HI>Tuscany.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_TVscany,</HI> anciently called <HI>Hetruria,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Clime.</NOTE> lieth vnder the Regiment of <HI>Sol,</HI> in the fift Cli|mate, betweene the Degrees fortie one, and fortie foure: a Countrey almost e|qually distant from the Equinoctiall and North-pole, and therefore by consequent of an ayre temperate, were it not that the Montaines cause some little excesse of both the passible qua|lities, heate and colde. Of this in winter, by reason they bee mantled with snowe, whereby the winde vireth with a more piercing sharpnes: of that in sommer, by the repercussiue force of the Sun-beames from the sides of those Hilles, at the foote whereof are most their Citties seated. Not hauing any valleys so large but that the scituation of the Towne therein, makes it communicate in the passion of both these extreames. For as writers well affirme that the hills <HI>Appennines</HI> are one fourth part of <HI>Italy:</HI> so is it also determined that they &amp; their Spurres, are three fourth parts of <HI>Tuscany.</HI></P>
<P>It is in length, if you measure along the Sea-coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The le~gth.</NOTE> two thousand fiue hundred furlonges, which make three hundred and twelue myles: but if you measure by the <HI>Diameter,</HI> accor|ding to <HI>Ptolomey,</HI> assigning it three Degrees, and forty seauen miles to a Degree, then it is some hundred fortie and odde miles: if according as the ordinarie Roade lies, which is neither somuch about as by the coast, nor so direct as by the <HI>Diame|ter,</HI> it is one hundred and seauenty miles. And thus doth <HI>Le|ander Alberti</HI> the latest and exactest Surueyour of <HI>Italie,</HI> recon|cile the authorities of <HI>Strabe, Plyny,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomey.</HI> But allowing sixtie miles to a <HI>Degree,</HI> it is in length one hundred and nintie miles, which is now the receaued opinion.</P>
<P>It is in bredth, one hundred where least,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The breadth.</NOTE> and in Circuite sixe

<P>It is limitted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The li|mits.</NOTE> West, with the Riuer <HI>Magra,</HI> and Mountaines of <HI>Lyguria,</HI> East, with <HI>Tyber:</HI> North, with the Mountaines <HI>Appennines</HI> and South, with the Sea.</P>

<P>These are the limits set downe by <HI>Polybius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The anti|tiquity.</NOTE> <HI>Plyny, Pomponius, Mela, Solynus, Ptolomey,</HI> and all other ancient writers: neither are we to enlarge this countrey so farre, as they that affirme the <HI>Tuscans</HI> possessed all betweene the <HI>Adriatick</HI> and <HI>Mediterra|nean</HI> Seas, from <HI>Nola</HI> in the kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> to the Moun|taines <HI>Rhesy,</HI> which is now the <HI>Grisons</HI> Countrey, and they say are come of the old <HI>Tuscans.</HI> True it is that these <HI>Tuscans</HI> were a mightie and powerfull people, such as oftentimes forced the <HI>Romaines</HI> to create a Dictator (which but in great extremities they might not do) to defend themselues from them: vntill the foure hundred and seauenth yeare after the foundation of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they were vtterly ouerthrowne at the Lake of <HI>Va|di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one,</HI> as <HI>Lyuie</HI> in his ninth booke affirmeth. Nor did the <HI>Ro|maines</HI> bring home onely glory, triumph and spoiles, from the conquered <HI>Tuscans,</HI> which argued the greatnesse of this nati|on: but they brought with them also (which argueth their an|tiquity) the habite of their youth, called <HI>Pratexta,</HI> the roabe of their elder age called <HI>Toga,</HI> the twelue <HI>Bundles</HI> of <HI>Roddes</HI> and <HI>Axes</HI> carried before the Consuls, called <HI>fasces:</HI> the seate of their <HI>Praetors</HI> and other Iudges carried vpon wheeles, called <HI>Sedes cu|rulis</HI> the <HI>Robe</HI> of the chiefe Magistrate, triumphall ornaments, and many other such ensignes of auncient greatnesse and Ma|iestie; all which were brought thence to <HI>Rome</HI> by <HI>Tarquinius Priscus:</HI> whereof <HI>Syluius Italicus</HI> in his 8 booke reporteth, confirmed by <HI>Dionisius Alicarnosseus.</HI> From this Nation like|wise whom the <HI>Greekes</HI> called <HI>Tirrheni</HI> of <HI>Firsos</HI> their poore

kinde of <HI>Cottage,</HI> and the <HI>Romaines</HI> first called <HI>Hetrusci</HI> of their religious worshipping the Gods, did the <HI>Romaines</HI> also bring many of those rites and ceremonies which they afterward vsed in their religion.</P>
<P>As <HI>Delphos</HI> is called by <HI>Ptolomey Vmbelicus Mundi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Srite.</NOTE> the Na|uile of the world, so may we say of <HI>Tuscani,</HI> that it is <HI>Vmbelicus Italia:</HI> howbeit in a Geometricall proportion, that is, in the middest of the forces of <HI>Italy:</HI> hauing on th'one side the <HI>state Ecclesiasticke,</HI> the kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> and Dutchy of <HI>Frbyne:</HI> and on the other counter-peasable to these, the States of <HI>Ve|nice, Myllan</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> the Dukedomes of <HI>Ferrara, Manto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> and <HI>Parma,</HI> and this State in the middest of the ballance, on which side socuer it inclineth, ouerweighing the other.</P>
<P>This is that which <HI>Guiccardine</HI> saith in the very entrance of his Historie, that the wisdome of <HI>Lorenzo Medici,</HI> and the sci|tuation of the state of <HI>Florence, Mantennero le cose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Italia bilan|ciate,</HI> vpheld th'affaires of <HI>Italy</HI> in equall Ballance. On which ground also <HI>Lodouico Zforza</HI> Duke of <HI>Millan</HI> layeth his foun|dation, for the reason he vseth in the third booke of the said historie: who very iealous of the <HI>Venetians</HI> greatnesse, hauing now vndertaken the protection of <HI>Pisa,</HI> and fearfull withall of the <HI>Frenches</HI> returne into <HI>Italy:</HI> he laboureth the Pope and King of <HI>Aragon,</HI> to enter into a confederation with the <HI>Flo|rentines,</HI> and to re-inuest them of <HI>Pisa,</HI> inferring, that by this meanes the French forces might be diuerted, which otherwise with the helpe of this state (being seated in the middest of <HI>Ita|ly</HI>&punc; might effect matters of preiudiciall consequent to all three: so fitly stands it either to dispeople the enimies forces, or to re|inforce their owne. And therefore <HI>Guiccardine</HI> very iudicially determineth, that it was a powerfull estate, rather <HI>per l'opportu|nit&agrave; del cito, che per la grandezza del Dominio,</HI> by the fitnesse of the scituation, then by the greatnesse of the Dominion.</P>
<P>But if we define the middest of <HI>Italy</HI> in an Arithmeticall pro|portion, that is, the center equally distant from both extreams, it will appeare to be true which <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Varro</HI> report, con|firmed also by <HI>Leander Albert<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> concerning <HI>Lago di p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e del luco,</HI> which <HI>Taci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI> in his first booke calleth <HI>Lacus Velnius, in Sabina</HI>

<P>Concerning the Riuers of worth there be few,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ri|uers.</NOTE> of name ma|ny: for the <HI>Italian</HI> hath a name for euery ditch, whereof if we allow them not <HI>Tiber, Arno</HI> is their chiefe: This Riuer was so named by <HI>Hercule Lybicus</HI> whose surnames were <HI>Libarno,</HI> that is, the Lyon of <HI>Lybia:</HI> and <HI>Musarno</HI> that is, the learned and va|liant, for <HI>Ar</HI> in the <HI>Arabian</HI> tongue signifies a Lyon.

True it is, that <HI>Guicciardini</HI> in the 4. booke of his History, and namely in that part of the booke which by order of th'inquisition is left out of all alow|ed copies, (because in this place, though himselfe were the Popes creature, and had great charge vnder him,) yet he fully, learnedly, and truly sheweth how by little and little, and by bad meanes the Church grew to her greatnesse, how she came not onely to quit her obedience to the empire, but to haue also a power and stroke in the election of the Emperour himselfe, not onely to make the Pope gouernour of Rome, but to in|croach also vpon the Territories and Citties of <HI>Romagna,</HI> the Marquisate of <HI>Ancina,</HI> the Dutchie of <HI>Spoletum</HI> and <HI>Beneuen|tum</HI> the superiority ouer the kingdome of <HI>Naples</HI>&punc; and the pos|session of that part of <HI>Tuscany</HI> (now called the Patrimony of S. <HI>Peter</HI>) he I say, diuideth the Popes state in this Country from the rest of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> thus. <HI>Eterminata dal torrente di Pescia &amp; dal Castello di San Luirico nel Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ado di Siena da vna banda: &amp;

But, I rather tie my selfe to the former limits, for that the <HI>Paglia</HI> is farre beyond Saint <HI>Luirick,</HI> whether the great Dukes state now reacheth. There is also <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cina</HI> which riseth a little aboue the Cittie of <HI>Massa,</HI> and so passing along the Countrey of <HI>Volterra</HI> fulleth into the Sea, with many such other, which in England we rather call Brookes or Riuerets; for of all these there are few sit either for burthen or Boate in Summer, except the <HI>Arno,</HI> yet heere often times scarce water for a Mill, as by their deuises at <HI>Florence</HI> to penne it vp appeareth. The reasons that the waters of this State are so small, be two: the former is, the violence of their downe|fall from the hilles, the better is because their heads are so neare to the Sea as they cannot haue space to be enlarged by the re|ceipt of other lesser Brookes; by which meanes onely all Ri|uers grow great, as namely the <HI>Rheine</HI> and <HI>Danowe,</HI> whereof this last hath from his head, which is in the Forrest <HI>Nera</HI> to the <HI>Mare Maggiore,</HI> where he payeth his tribute aboue two thou|sand miles, and receaueth into his bed by the way three score nauigable Riuers.</P>
<P>The Lakes in this State, are neither many nor great, nothing so faire or fruitfull as those of <HI>Lombardy</HI> namely <HI>Lago di Garda,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lakes</NOTE> <HI>Lago d Ise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, Lago d Como,</HI> and <HI>Lago Maggiore:</HI> the chiefe in <HI>Tuscany</HI> are these, <HI>Lago di Trasimen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> vnder the Pope, who let|teth it out to diuers Farmers for ten thousand Duckets the yeare, which haue the fishing, whereof it is very fruitfull and yeeldeth them also no little gaine.

<P>It is rather to be called a Roade then a Harborough,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liuorno or Ligorno.</NOTE> and to be obserued that this Sea neither ebbeth nor floweth. Here his Highnesse daily buildeth, meaning to make it a Cittie, the walles and fortifications being almost finished. It is in forme sixe square, in circuite a mile three quarters, the length of the Curtaine is two hundred and sixteene paces, the face of the Bulwarke, is one hundred thirtie and eight. From the <HI>Spurre</HI> which is fifteene paces thick, to the <HI>Flanker</HI> which is so many broade, are eighteene paces. The Diameter of the <HI>Piazza</HI> is foure hundred and fiftie. This proportion no doubt swarueth from the strict rules of fortification, neither can I warrant the relation true by the line; I was forced to passe it in hast, and <HI>sanquam aliud agens,</HI> to auoide all ielousie; whereof I thought fit to aduertise the curious Reader, and to preuent the enui|ous detracter. Here is bestowed great cost, being indeed the onely Keye by which all commodities are transported and brought in, not onely for the vse of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> but euen for the most places of <HI>Italy</HI> so that it bringeth in a very great enrate to the great Dukes coaffers, as I must more particularlie and more fitlie aduertise hereafter.</P>

<P>This State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great Dukes state.</NOTE> besides that it is enclosed with the Mountaines as with a wall on three-sides, and with the Sea on the fourth, and so consequently by scituation passing strong: it hath also many Castles and Fortresses, as <HI>Rodicofany, Monte-falcon, Pele|grine,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Castels.</NOTE> <HI>Charole, Sansubastians, Lusignano, Monterisine, Empoli, Ca|strecaro, Saffa,</HI> and diuers others, to the number of thirty, where|in is garrison more or lesse: But of others which stand rather to shew the manner of fortifications in elder ages, and the force of time by which they are ruined, then for any vse of the time present, there are aboue three hundred. By which number may very probably be coniectured their many and diuers States in this small circuite in former times: for as it appeareth by Historie, not onely <HI>Florence, Siena</HI> and <HI>Pisa</HI> (which of late yeares were reduced into one gouernment) but also <HI>Pistoia, A|rezzo, Volterra,</HI> and almost all the Citties now vnder the great Duke, had euery one their seuerall and distinct state. Wherevp|on it was necessary, each State should haue her Castles and Fortes to affront those that confined vpon them.

<P>This Cittie of <HI>Florence,</HI> after many conflicts with the olde Citty of <HI>Fesulae,</HI> (whereof now almost remaineth no memory, but the hilles whereon it stood) getting the vpper hand, and many of that olde towne following the fortune of the winner, comming hither to dwell, it grew to beare the name of a great and rich Cittie: which till then (euer since the time of <HI>Sylla,</HI> by whom they say it was first founded and made a Collony of the <HI>Romaines</HI>) bare rather the name of a Bourough, then otherwise.

to eight <HI>Priori,</HI> and a <HI>Gonfalonier</HI> of Iustice, who was to hold his place for 2. moneths only. Presently after they bought <HI>Arezzo</HI> of <HI>Mastino della sala,</HI> for forty thousand Duckets. And in the yeare 1471. they wan by force <HI>Volterra,</HI> one of the 12. first Citties of <HI>Tuscany</HI> and honoured with the birth of the Poet <HI>Persius.</HI> They got also <HI>Pysa</HI> &amp; the whole State thereof, of whose reuolt, and recouery, what parts taking there was, &amp; what time was spent, and how many Millions it cost them to be reposses|sed thereof, <HI>Guicciardine</HI> very fully discourseth, and were here too tedious to be particularly related. The gouerment of a <HI>Gon|falonier</HI> was altered by <HI>Gualteri Francese</HI> Duke of <HI>Athens,</HI> who at the Citties request requiring aide, was sent thither by <HI>Robert</HI> king of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> and at his first comming deposed the <HI>Gonfalonier</HI> and <HI>Priory,</HI> &amp; vsurped himselfe; but he was quickly expulsed, and the former officer reinuested: till the time of Pope <HI>Alex|ander</HI> the sixt, whose sonne <HI>Casar Borgia</HI> duke <HI>Valentinois</HI> sought to bring in the three banished <HI>Medici, Piero, Giouanni,</HI> and <HI>Gui|liano</HI>; wherevpon the <HI>Florentines</HI> made <HI>Piero Sederini</HI> their <HI>Gon|falonier</HI> perpetuall, as <HI>Buonacorsi</HI> an approued <HI>Italian</HI> writer, &amp; <HI>Guicciardine</HI> in his fist booke doth testifie.

It is heere to be obserued; that these are called Castles, not that they be onely Fortresses and places of strength, but that they be large townes fortified with wall and Bulwarke, and haue their Territories; they onely want Bishops Seas, wherein they differ from Citties. It standeth in the middest of this Valley vpon the riuer <HI>Bisen|tio</HI>; it is in forme sex-angular, at each corner a Bulwarke <HI>alla Moderna</HI> very defensible; the walles in circuite two miles, with an olde peece at the East built (they say) by <HI>Frederico Barba|rossa.</HI> The <HI>Contado</HI> (the Territory) of this Towne is in length eight miles, in bredth foure, in circuite foure and twentie, within which compasse (with those within the Towne) are fiftie nine Churches, eight and thirtie Monasteries, and other religious houses, and of all sorts of people sixteene thousand, whereof two thousand are religious.

the <HI>French</HI> forces passed into <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and so to <HI>Naples,</HI> in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the eight, as by the historie appeareth.

<P>This Towne is famous, or rather in famous, for the two fac|tions of the <HI>Bianchi</HI> and <HI>Nery,</HI> which ruined themselues, and troubled the peace of <HI>Florence</HI> also: it began thus. Two young Gentlemen of the towne falling out, and so proceeding from words to blowes, it chanced one of them receiued a light hurt, The father of the other (because he would kill all motions to a farther quarrell) sends his Sonne to aske pardon of the Father and Parentage of the other whom he had hurt: but he causing his seruants to lay hold on him, commaunded his right hand to be cut off, and sent him away with this answere, <HI>Va dal tuo Pa|dre &amp; digli, che le ferite non si curano con parole ma colferro</HI>; Goe to thy father and tell him, hurts are not cured with words, but with the sworde. Herevpon grew that great and bloudy enmi|tie betweene those two houses, which drew into it all the great families of <HI>Pistoia,</HI> as also them of <HI>Florence,</HI> where the <HI>Donati</HI> banded with the <HI>Neri,</HI> and the <HI>Circhi</HI> with the <HI>Bianchi.</HI> Since which faction, there hath also another risen no lesse dangerous then the former, betweene the <HI>Cancellieri</HI> and the <HI>Panzadici,</HI> scarse yet so composed, but that vpon euery small occasion it is ready to breake out.</P>
<P>This Towne pretendeth to be much priuiledged aboue all other Citties vnder the great Duke, for at the time when they yeelded to the State of <HI>Florence,</HI> it was among other Capitula|cons concluded; that in any <HI>Bando</HI> (Proclamation) whatsoeuer except the Cittie and <HI>Contado</HI> of <HI>Pistoia</HI> were expresly named, it was to be vnderstood exempt &amp; freed from the same, which indeed is still obserued, howbeit a course is taken neuer to leaue

<P>I cannot passe the direct way from hence to <HI>Pisa,</HI> whether the course of this discourse directs me, vnlesse I passe vnder the walles of <HI>Lucca</HI>: which being no part of this State, I know not how I may speake of; that haue vndertaken to write of nothing else: and yet passing so neare, I know not how to auoide some mention thereof, that am likewise to ad|uertise of what I haue seene.

The reasons of these fortifica|tions, garrisons, and prouisions which they make, is the iealous feare they haue of the great Duke, of whom all their State which is somewayes fiftie miles in length is euery way enuiro|ned, whose greatnesse is nothing pleasing to the <HI>Lucchesi</HI> nei|ther can they well digest that his title (<HI>di Toscana</HI>) and therfore the <HI>Signoria</HI> of this State, sending letters of congratulation (they say) but it is more probable about some other their af|faires to <HI>Cosmo Medici,</HI> presently after his creation of great Duke, they stiled their letters thus. <HI>All' Ilsmo e Ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">smo principi Cosmo Medici gran Duca (m) Tuscana.</HI> To which garbro of theirs the <HI>Italia</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rime also alludeth, which saith thus;

Implying that it is no reason he should be intitled great Duke of the whole, hauing no more but the one halfe, But how sooner this towne stand <HI>prouista</HI> as it braggeth, and are able to keepe him out of themselues two or three yeares together, more then probable it is, that the feare of the <HI>Spanish</HI> King, to whose pro|tection it is recommended, doth curbe his desire in attempting the action, watching ouer this prety State with an ambitious and couetous eye, <HI>come Lo sparuicre alla quaglia,</HI> as the Hauke ouer the Quaile, hoping one day for an oppertunitie.</P>
<P>I am now by order-leauing <HI>Lucca</HI> to looke to her selfe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pisa.</NOTE> to passe the Monte <HI>Saint Iulian,</HI> and arriue at <HI>Pisa:</HI> a Cittie in for|mer times very populous as any in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> now so dispeopled
<PB N="22" REF="13">
as there are not iudged aboue fourteteene thousand persons, though in circuite it be little lesse then <HI>Florence:</HI> the Walles for the most part are of Bricke, but in some places of square Stone, the Ramparts conuenient, the Bulwarkes not many nor corre|spondent: the peece of cheefest import is the Castle vpon the South-west of the towne, wherein is a garrison of fiftie, with munition and other necessaries, for the vse as is abouesaid of keeping the Citty in awe. The scite hereof is in a Plaine vpon the Riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> which passeth through the middest therof with one bridge onely, and falleth into the Sea some sixe miles be|lowe; whereby it appeareth that the land hath lately gotten much vpon the Sea on this coast, as we finde in diuers places vpon our coast in England, for that in the time of <HI>Strabo</HI> he re|porteth, it was but twenty furlongs off, which is two miles and a halfe distant from the Sea.</P>
<P>Out of this Riuer is cut a Ditch from this Towne to <HI>Linor|no,</HI> fifteene miles long, for the more conuenient carriage of such wares as arriue in that Roade, and are thence conueyed by wa|ter from <HI>Pisa</HI> vp to <HI>Florence</HI>; and so by land into other places of <HI>Tuscany, Romagna, Lombardia,</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> also. The Boates wherein these wares are carried are but small, in number be|tweene six and seauen hundred, which our English Marchants <HI>Burlando</HI> (gibing) call the great Dukes fleete. The nature of this plaine is for the most part marish, though in times past it was fit either for pasture or tillage, as by the commoditie there|out reaped for the maintenance of the cittie appeareth by <HI>Guic|ciard.</HI> But since that the Cittie being conquered by the <HI>Floren|tines,</HI> and most of the auncient <HI>Pisani</HI> departed, some into <HI>Sici|lia,</HI> other into <HI>Sardegna, Corsica,</HI> and other places, preferring a voluntary bannishment, before a forced subiection: the Towne hath beene so desolate as there haue not beene people suffici|ent to maintaine this plaine against the fury of <HI>Arno,</HI> whereby it hath beene much wasted, as hath partly beene said.</P>
<P>There are, besides the commodity of the seat, lying betweene <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Lyuorno,</HI> three other causes, that this Cittie is fre|quented, otherwise it would be very desolate. The first is the
<PB N="23" REF="13">
especially fauour of the Prince himselfe, who because he was here borne, beareth an extraordinary affection to the place, as by his often comming and long tarrying appeareth. Another is, for that it is the place where properly the order of <HI>S. Stephen</HI> is resident, where the Knights of this order haue their Pallace, Officers, and other dependances. The last, for that there is a studie as they call it in <HI>Italy</HI> (a Vniuersity) erected by <HI>Cosmo,</HI> and is reasonably frequented.</P>
<P>In this Towne among many other Churches and Monaste|ries, is that excellent Fabrick of the <HI>Battisterio,</HI> built (they say) in fourteene dayes: It standeth hard at the West-end of the <HI>Duomo,</HI> which for the beauty thereof might haue compared with that of <HI>Siena</HI> so much commended, had it not by mishap beene burned in the yeare 1595. in October; it is now in the repairing at the great Dukes charges: Howbeit in liew hereof, he hath raised the price of his Salt fiue. <HI>Quatrini</HI> in the pound, throughout this State for the space of ten yeares: and it is to be thought (by examples too many of like nature in other places) that being once grauted, it shall not then be ended. On the North of this Church is the <HI>Campo Santu,</HI> as they call it, their <HI>Golgetha</HI> or place of buriall, the earth whereof was brought in ships from the <HI>Terrasanta,</HI> as their Histories record: &amp; as they affirme, the dead consume there in foure and twenty hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es. Not farre from this place is an old ruinous Tower, called by them <HI>(Torre di fame)</HI> in memory of the mercylesse crueltie of <HI>Ruggiero</HI> the Archbishop, who vpon suspition of treason im|mured therein <HI>Conte Hugolino</HI> a Noble <HI>Pisano,</HI> and his foure children, causing them to be starued: of whom <HI>Dante</HI> the Poet in his 33. chapter <HI>dell'inferno,</HI> very elegantly discourseth, fai|ning, that there for a torment due to such a fact, the <HI>Conte</HI> li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth vpon the Bishops-head with a neuer satisfied greedinesse.

looking for great praise at the Dukes hands for his rare plotte, and finding after that it disliked his Highnesse, in a melancho|lie discontent threw himselfe into the <HI>Arno:</HI> he hath also ano|ther lesser house lately built, wherein are many small Statues of Marble and Mettall, many Medalles and Pictures, some pain|ted, others of Feathers very exquisitely artificiall. Besides pee|ces of Vre vntried both of golde &amp; siluer, Corall vnpollished, whereof yee shall see some growe vpon the Sculles of dead|men, with infinite such like, more delightfull to be seene, then needfull to be related of. Vnto this building is adioyning a Garden of Simples, not much inferiour to that of <HI>Padoa:</HI> But the thing of best vse and greatest cost, and therefore vnfittest to be forgotten, is a Conduict of water vpon Arches into the Towne from <HI>Valdeculci</HI> fiue mile off, where with the better part of the Cittie is serued. Other buildings I remember not, worth the remembring; except the <HI>Campanile,</HI> which Architecture hath this varietie, that the top thereof by a line perpendicularly downe-falling to the ground, and sheweth that it is prominent or hanging ouer the <HI>Basis</HI> ten or twelue foote by the square. As for the Cittie it selfe, it is the greater halfe voide, wherein is no|thing but Gardens of hearbes and rootes; the houses that there be, are for the most part so old and ruinous, as that the great Duke hath lately giuen commandement, that euery one accor|ding to his abilitie should either build new, or at the least re|paire and trim them on the out-sides for the better grace of the towne. So vnlike is <HI>Pisa</HI> to it selfe; which in former times was able to wage battaile at land with the <HI>Florentines,</HI> at Sea with the <HI>Genoese</HI>; yea and with <HI>Venice</HI> also: And before that, to con|quere <HI>Sardigna,</HI> to ouercome the King of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and bring him prisoner to <HI>Rome,</HI> to recouer <HI>Palermo</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> from the <HI>Sarazens,</HI> to assist the <HI>French</HI> with a mighty Nauie in their voy|age to the holy land, to send fortie ships to the recouery of <HI>A|lexandria</HI> for <HI>Almerick</HI> King of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> to aide th'Emperour <HI>Frederick Barbarossa</HI> against the state of <HI>Millan</HI>; besides many other their famous and victorious conquests; wherevpon one saith: <HI>Erat Pisa, altera Roma fuim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Troes, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> Ilium, nunc seges

<P>To speake of the diuers gouerments of this Towne and the many alterations it hath suffered, were a discourse, though not altogether needlesse or impertinent, yet so large or rather tedi|ous, as would be altogether disproportionate to my former bre|uitie: I will leaue it therefore altogether vntouched, and go for|ward my iourney to <HI>Siena.</HI></P>
<P>This Cittie chalengeth the title of much Antiquitie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siena.</NOTE> being built by <HI>Sanesius</HI> the sonne of <HI>Remus, Romulus</HI> his brother, which may seeme to carry some matter of truth, for that the Armes of the Cittie is a Wolfe, with two Infants sucking vpon her: which Armes are to be seene in diuers places of the Towne both in Marble and Mettall. It is called by <HI>Pliny, Colonia Se|nensis,</HI> and by <HI>Tacitus</HI> in the 20. booke of his Historie, but whe|ther it was built by <HI>Sanesius,</HI> or the <HI>Galli Senones</HI> that went with <HI>Brennus</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> I leaue indifferent to the Reader: this last is alleaged out of <HI>Ptolomies</HI> Fables, though I rather subscribe to the former. It is seated vpon the tops of diuers small hils, very neerely meeting together, which with their declinings makes the Scituation very vneuen, and such as I haue not else-where seene: by reason whereof it is iudged infinitely strong, as not hauing any commanding hill neere, whereby it might be pre|iudiced, nor any way by which forces may be brought before it; saue onely at the two gates towards <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Florence:</HI> &amp; yet there so narrow, as there cannot possibly come aboue ten Souldiers <HI>alla filata</HI> in rancke. So that as <HI>Liuorno</HI> is the key by which all forces must passe that by Sea would approach <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> so is <HI>Siena</HI> the Porte or gate by which they must enter, that eyther from <HI>Naples</HI> or the Churches state would come to anoye it. For from the way of <HI>Romagna</HI> or <HI>Bologna,</HI> there is very hard passage for an Armie, so sharpe and inaccessible are the mountaines, which being well considered by <HI>Cosmo</HI> (then Duke) of <HI>Florence,</HI> no maruaile though he neuer rested till he had got the towne and whole state of <HI>Siena</HI> into his hands.</P>
<P>The meanes thus; The Cittie about fortie fiue yeares since, being besieged by the forces of the Pope, <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and

<HI>Cosmo</HI> Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> rendred it selfe at length to the Empe|rour, and receaued a garrison of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but keeping still their manner of gouerment which they before vsed. The Em|perour by earnest sollicitation of the D. <HI>d'Alua,</HI> in whom the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> his purse (they say) had got him great interest, was content to render it into the Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> his possessi|on, for certaine summes of money to be paid, besides a yearely rent, with a recognition that it was holden of him, and certaine other couenants which some say were neuer performed, as also that this contract was made without the consent of <HI>Philip</HI> king of <HI>Spaine</HI> that now is, whereof were not his hands full of acti|ons in other places, it is thought some stirre might arise. So that <HI>Cosmo de' Medici</HI> the second Duke of <HI>Florence</HI> vnited that state with this of <HI>Siena,</HI> which is by estimation bigger then the state of <HI>Millan,</HI> and the most fruitefull part of all <HI>Tuscany.</HI> Wherevp|on he altered his Stile which before was <HI>Dux Florentiae,</HI> and in|tituled himselfe <HI>Dux Florentiae &amp; Senarum.</HI></P>

<P>As for their diligence in digging, setting, sowing, manuring and weeding of their ground, it is such as therewith the Dutch diligence in their Roote grounds may not compare.

<P>These are the fruites of the earth whereof they feed, for of others I speake not: and to giue these their due, many of them be very delicate and pleasant; as their <HI>Vna Moscutella,</HI> and <HI>Ri|maldesca,</HI> their Figs, Apricocks, Musk-mellons, and such like: howbeit considering either the little time they last, or the small quantitie they haue thereof, the benefit is not so great as is ima|gined; for none of these last named lasteth aboue two mo|neths, except it be the grape, whereof some few are hanged vp in the <HI>Palco</HI> roofe, to serue the richer sort in Lent. As for the poorer, their chiefest food is Herbage all the yeare through.
<PB N="32" REF="18">
Indeed for the moneths of August and September, while Grapes be ripe, he keepeth a continuall feast, making them his onely food.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Vine.</NOTE> The Vine which without comparison is the greatest com|moditie of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> if not of <HI>Italy</HI>; hath these vses. Of the Grape they feed, of the iuyce they make Wine; of the shreedings they make small bundles, like our Fagots of gaule in <HI>Cambridge,</HI> &amp; sell them for two <HI>quatrini</HI> a peece for firing: of their leaues they feed their Oxen, or else dung their land; &amp; lastly of the stones they feed their Pigions, which after the Vintage they riddle out of the Grap: being dryed, and these they sell at 20. <HI>soldi</HI> the <HI>Staio.</HI></P>
<P>There are diuers sorts of Grapes, the names of such as I re|me~ber are these; <HI>Vna Canaiola,</HI> good either to eate or for Wine; <HI>Passerina</HI> a small Grape, whereof Sparrowes feed, good onely for Wine; <HI>Trebbiana</HI> the best sort of white Grapes for Wine, whereof they make their <HI>Vin Trebbiano, Zibibbo</HI>; these are dryed for Lent: <HI>Moscatella</HI> with a taste like Muske, not for Wine, but to eate; <HI>Vna grossa</HI> not to eate, but for Wine; <HI>Raue|rutta,</HI> of itselfe neither to eate, nor for Wine, but a few of these put among a great vessell of Wine, giueth it a colour, for which vse it onely serueth; <HI>San Columbana</HI> and <HI>Rimaldesca</HI> a very de|licate Grape, either for Wine or to eate; <HI>Luglisla</HI> which hath his name of the moneth of Iuly wherein it is ripe, better to eate then for Wine; and lastly <HI>Cerisiana,</HI> named for the taste it hath like a Cherry, better for Wine then to eate.</P>
<P>They haue also as many names for their Figs, the best are the <HI>Brugiotti,</HI> which being needlesse to recount, as also to stand thus particularly vpon all the rest, I will omit to speake: onely in a word I will speake of the Mulberry, for that the mention thereof draweth consequently therewithall the discourse of the Silke-worme, which being another of the greatest commodi|ties of <HI>Tuscany</HI> I may not forget.</P>
<P>In the two moneths of May and Iune this worme laboureth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Silke-wormes.</NOTE> the rest of the yeare they be onely seedes kept in some warme &amp; close places, where they may neither be indangered by cold
<PB N="33" REF="18">
nor thunder, for either of these destroyeth them. When she hath wrought her selfe into a bottome, they put it into warme water to finde the end thereof, but if they would preserue the worme for seed, then they finde the end without putting the bottome into water (for this killeth the worme) which being found, and wound vpon a Cane, they suffer the worme to lye vpon a wollen cloath, till growing to a Flie it engender with another, whereof come infinite seeds, which are as is said, kept close all the yeare till the beginning of May, when they are laide in the Sunne and so hatched, but for want of heate, and to haue of them betimes, the women will hatch them in their bo|somes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mulbery.</NOTE> So soone as they be wormes they haue of Mulberie leaues giuen them, whereof they onely feed, to which purpose are daily great store of trees planted: the leafe is sold at foure <HI>quattrini</HI> the pound. Of this sort of trees the great Duke hath planted such plenty along the banckes of <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI> and about the Ditches of townes and other publick places, as it is probably iudged they will within these few yeares be annually worth thirty thousand Duckets. And whereas heretofore the Silke-workers of <HI>Florence,</HI> besides their owne, were vsually wont to buy from <HI>Naples, Lombardie,</HI> and <HI>Greece,</HI> so much silke as year|ly amounted to three hundred thousand Duckets, it is now thought that shortly they shall haue enough of their owne; for yee shall obserue, that they of <HI>Siena</HI> are richer in lands then they of <HI>Florence,</HI> and therefore trade lesse in all Mechanicall professions: <HI>I saulsi ricchi d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> entrada, i fiorentini ricchi per indu|stria:</HI> which is the reason that the <HI>Florentines</HI> exceed the other so farre herein: insomuch as it is thought here are yeerly made of <HI>Florence</HI> Rashes to the worth of two Millions of Duckets, &amp; of Silket and Cloathes of gold and siluer, to the value of three Millions; hence grew this Axiome of <HI>Aristotle; The more bar|raine the soyle, the more rich the Citie</HI>: as he obserued by <HI>Athens</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> and we finde by <HI>Norremburge</HI> in <HI>Germanie.</HI> Good reason they of <HI>Florence</HI> haue to encrease this commoditie, by all possible meanes, without the which I see not how they should be able (not exhausting in few yeares their estate) to be
<PB N="34" REF="19">

<P>Another helpe is their egregious &amp; incredible <HI>Parsimony</HI> in feeding, as also their frugality from extraordinary spending, for should they either fare, or exceed in other charges, as we do in this cou~trey, it were impossible but their state should be ruined.</P>
<P>Concerning Herbage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hearbes &amp; Rootes.</NOTE> I shall not need to speake, but that it is the most generall food of the <HI>Tuscan,</HI> at whose table a Sallet is as ordinary, as Salt at ours; for being eaten of all sorts of per|sons, &amp; at all times of the yeare: of the riche because they loue to spare; of the poore, because they cannot choose; of many Religious, because of their vow, of most others because of their want: it remaineth to beleeue that which themselues confesse; namely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flesh.</NOTE> that for euery horse-load of flesh eaten, there is ten cart loades of hearbes and rootes, which also their open Markets and priuate tables doe witnesse, and whereof if one talke with them fasting, he shall haue sencible feeling.</P>
<P>But for the better proofe of the little flesh here spent, it shall not be amisse to remember what the Chancellor of <HI>Prato</HI> told me concerning this matter, who seemed by his discourse a man of good vnderstanding, &amp; who ought by his office to haue the knowledge hereof very familiar; vpon some conference with him had about the great Dukes impositions and <HI>Gabell</HI> which he had in that state, he tolde me among diuers other matters, which shalbe remembred hereafter, that he had out of <HI>Prato</HI> &amp; the precincts thereof, a thousand Duckets <HI>communibm annis</HI> for
<PB N="35" REF="19">
the flesh there eaten, at the rate of fiue <HI>denari</HI> the pound, for so much he hath. Now if we reduce Duckets to <HI>denari</HI> (which are the fourth part of a <HI>Quattrino</HI>) &amp; deuide that number by fiue, we shall finde the number of pounds of flesh eaten there, after the rate of twelue ounces to the pounds (for so is their weight of all things whatsoeuer) which summe by the rule of three we may reduce to pounds English of sixteene ounces, and then deuiding by fourteene, know how many Stone is there eaten in a yeare. According to which computation we shall finde 18000 Stone: the people there being, as is already said 16000 persons, so that there is little more then a Stone a peece for the yeare: a proportion which in Newgate market, and S. <HI>Ni|cholas</HI>-shambles will hardly be beleeued.</P>
<P><HI>Pythagoras</HI> found by the dimension of the foote the perfect <HI>Rieratte</HI> of <HI>Hercules</HI> &amp; <HI>Phidias</HI> of <HI>Athens,</HI> found by the paw of the Lion, the true proportion of the whole body: so by this small store of flesh spent in <HI>Prato,</HI> may well be conceiued what proportion is spent in the whole state of <HI>Tuscany.</HI> It may here not impertinently be remembred (speaking of flesh) of a kinde of meate which the <HI>Italian</HI> hath out of <HI>Barbaria,</HI> howbeit in no great quantity, which they call <HI>Micista,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Micista.</NOTE> it is a powder made of Beefe dried &amp; sold in their shops; for the nature of the flesh of <HI>Africk</HI> being such not to take Salt, (the <HI>Alarbaes</HI> of that coun|trey) dwelling in tents, which they alwayes remoue when their cattle haue eaten vp the pasture, to some other place, doe bake their flesh in Ouens so drie, till it may be beaten to powder, which done, they barrell it vp, &amp; carry with them for a kind of very good food. And I haue heard also that the <HI>Tartars</HI> bring of this into the warres, wherof they feed, and wherwith putting about two handfuls of it into water, they giue their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ors<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, which without any other prouinder keepeth them fat &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">isty.</P>
<P>As concerning their graine in <HI>Tuscany,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Graine.</NOTE> it is very much in kind &amp; very little in quantity: wherof most years they haue too sen|cible feeling, &amp; are supplied out of other places, as <HI>Sicilia; Sar|digna,</HI> &amp; somtimes <HI>England</HI> &amp; the East-countries: they haue of Wheat more then either Rie or Barley, yet of neither sufficient:
<PB N="36" REF="20">
as for their <HI>Sagina, Panico, Miglio, Surgo Turco,</HI> and such like, they are fine names, but make but course meale and bread only for the poorer sort, who, (might they not want thereof) would thinke their market much amended.</P>
<P>Their haruest is in <HI>Iune,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haruest.</NOTE> they mowe their Wheate and Rie, &amp; reape their Barley, quite contrary to the common course in England: they cut their corne while it is somwhat greene, I take it, least it should shill: they suffer it afterwards to stand in shocks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ill it be well withered and dryed, then making a store on the ground where it grew, they presently thresh it; &amp; stack vp the Strawe for their necessarie vses: the same ground which hath carried this crop, if it be in heart is againe presently tilled, and sowed with <HI>Miglio, Panico, Sagina,</HI> or some pulse or other, which againe they reape in September. They measure their corne by the <HI>Staio,</HI> as we ours by the Strike or Bushell, it con|taineth in weight fiftie fiue pounds, at twelue ounces the pou~d. And as we measure our land by the Acre, so they theirs by the <HI>Staioro,</HI> which taketh his name of the <HI>Staio:</HI> because one of these parcels of land, if it be on the hilles, will aske a <HI>Staio</HI> of corne to feed it, otherwise in the valleys euery measure will ordinarily feed foure <HI>Straiora,</HI> I suppose that six of these make one of our Acres. The country-man will stirre of them (as we call it) eighteene with his two yoake of Oxen; the one yoake feeding while the other laboureth in one day. He hath for his labour foure <HI>Crazie</HI> a peece, which is three-pence starling; so that he and his beasts earne some foure shillings six-pence ster|ling the day: how this agreeth with our rate in <HI>England,</HI> I can|not say, I went not out so good a husband. The <HI>staioro</HI> doth or|dinarily yeeld seauen and eight <HI>staia</HI> crop, which is little short of the proportion of foure quarters an Acre.</P>
<P>The nature of the soile is generally light and sandy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soile.</NOTE> laid in small ridges like the fields of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> which as I take it, argu|eth the lightnesse. But by reason of the Citties &amp; great townes neare, and the number of people, it is much forced, and made more fruitfull. For there are those who all their life time doe no|thing but with their Asse go vp and downe the cities, gathering
<PB N="37" REF="20">
vp the dung in the streetes, and carrying it to the land of those with whom they haue bargained, paying out of euery Asses burthen one <HI>quattrino</HI> to the Duke before they passe the gates, but this is a discourse for another place.</P>
<P>It remaineth to speake of the Salt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt.</NOTE> another co~moditie which they haue here in <HI>Tuscany</HI> in some reasonable manner. It is very white and good, much better then that of the Churches Salt, which hath almost the colour of Saw-dust, or that of <HI>Liguria</HI> which is little better. The two places from whence they haue this commoditie, is the Citty of <HI>Grossetta</HI> in the <HI>Maremma,</HI> and the pits not far from the Citty of <HI>Volterra:</HI> howbeit they make of it at these pits in greater measure; where it is reported are daily made throughout the yeare twenty foure <HI>Moggie,</HI> euery of these measures being foure and twenty <HI>Staia,</HI> that is of our measure some sixteene Strike a peece: so that there are dayly made 48. quarters. They know when it is sufficiently boiled by the throwing in of an Egge, for if it sinck, then is it not yet perfect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sulphurius waters ef|fect.</NOTE> but if it swimmeth (<HI>a galla</HI>) then they boile it no long|er. There are not farre hence (may I digresse so farre) waters of such a scalding and sulphurious nature, as if a Dog or such like creature be tied to a rope and throwne therein for the space of a quarter of an houre, yee pull out nothing but the bare bones. And true it is, that the aire here abouts sometimes of the yeare is so contagious, as the inhabitants abandon their homes. The place being so dangerous, I will dwell no longer vpon the dis|course thereof, but returne to the Salt-pits, out of which the great Duke maketh no small benefit, considering he buyeth it at one <HI>quattrini</HI> the pound, and selleth it againe at twelue, and in some parts of his State at fifteene, which being bought at this rate commeth to two Duckets the <HI>Staio:</HI> Howbeit, it is said of some, that it costeth him fiue <HI>quattrini</HI> the pound, which I rather beleeue, and so his gaine is but two third parts. Sure I am that there is a <HI>Bando</HI> vpon a great penaltie, that none pre|sume to buy but of his officers onely. And seeing here is men|tion made of the great Dukes impositions vpon Salt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I will also annex his gaine raised by Wheate, though I must confesse their
<PB N="38" REF="21">
place more proper when I shall speake of his Reuenew.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Raccolt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Wheat en|grossed.</NOTE> (haruest) when wheate is at the cheapest, a note is taken of euery mans particular croppe, how much he hath, what will seed his ground; and serue his house; the rest the officers will buy at the price of the Market; he is not (as I take it (directly forced to sell it: but a <HI>Bando</HI> is sent forth, that no man shall buy, and so by consequent, because he must needs haue money, with an vnwilling willingnesse he is content they shall haue it. This is bought vnder pretence to haue the Citties well stored, whether it is carryed into the great Dukes Grana|ries, in which places for any accident either of dearth or of warre, (though for the one the countrey is well secured) here is very good store to be found: It was reported in the <HI>Magizini</HI> (Store-houses) at <HI>Pisa</HI> when I was there, there was no lesse then one hundred and fiftie thousand <HI>Staia.</HI> And it was likewise hol|den for certaine, that some yeares of plentie, he buieth eight or nine hundreth thousand, at the rate commonly of foure or fiue <HI>Liuers</HI> the <HI>Staio</HI>; (a <HI>Liuer</HI> is nine-pence sterling) and selleth it againe as this yeare he did for aboue ten. Now by buying such an infinite Masse, and selling it at such a rate, the gaine is easily computed to be almost as many Duckets as were <HI>Staia</HI> bought: His subiects will tell vs of a Millons gaine some yeare, but that were infinite. Now least when the new Corne comes into his Granaries, he should not vent the old, as being sustie, or hauing some other fault, a <HI>Bando</HI> is sent out, that the Bakers shall bake no other. There is another inconuenience stranger then this, a case wherein a man may not serue himselfe of his owne, which had it not beene tolde me by a Gentleman <HI>Sanese</HI> of good cre|dit, I should hardly haue beleeued, much lesse haue aduentured to aduertise thereof. If a Gentleman of <HI>Siena</HI> haue a <HI>Villa</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Mont Alcina,</HI> neare by; and therein good store of Wheate to serue his turne for the maintenance of his house in <HI>Siena,</HI> and whether, it may be with little cost brought, as not being farre off, and where perhaps he cannot well spare money to buy of others: notwithstanding he cannot be suffe|red to bring of his owne to his house, but must there take of the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His stile.</NOTE> Concerning his Stile, it is to be obserued, that since the go|uernment came to the ha~ds of this familie, it hath altered foure times: for first, when by <HI>Clement</HI> the 7. his meanes, who was a <HI>Medici, Alexandro</HI> had obtained the signory of <HI>Florence,</HI> he was entituled Prior perpetuall: after that matching in the house of <HI>Austria,</HI> he was created Duke of <HI>Florence.</HI> The title yet chan|ged twice more in the person of <HI>Cosmo,</HI> father to this great duke now liuing, for hauing vnited the States of <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Siena,</HI> he was entituled, <HI>Dux Florentiae et Senarum:</HI> And after by <HI>Pius Quintus</HI> he was created <HI>Magnus Dux Hetruriae</HI> for some speci|all seruice done to the Church.</P>
<P>This title of Duke is not of any great antiquitie in <HI>Italy</HI>; for although <HI>Titus Liuius</HI> speaketh of <HI>Duces,</HI> yet he meaneth Cap|taines of Souldiers, or rather such as had the leading of an Ar|mie by the Senates appointment, and not such as haue absolute authoritie ouer Citties and Countries. The first bringer in of this name into <HI>Italy,</HI> was <HI>Longinus</HI> King of the <HI>Lombardes,</HI> one hundred sixtie sixe yeares after the declination of the <HI>Ro|maine</HI> Empire. By him at the first were created foure, which bore their title of these places; <HI>Beneuentum, Turine, Fruily,</HI> and <HI>Spoleto</HI>: At which time also were instituted the two Marque|sarts of <HI>Ancona</HI> and <HI>Treuiso,</HI> which still liue in the names, though dead in the persons that should haue them: and it should seeme in some sort, this title of Marquesse was better then that of Duke. For in their language (saith <HI>Biondo</HI>) it signifieth <HI>Perpetuum Magistratum,</HI> because they might leaue their title and Signorie to their heires, which the Dukes could not doe, but by the leaues of the Kings of <HI>Lombardie.</HI> Some say this word of <HI>Marques</HI> is deriued from the <HI>French (Mar|que)</HI> which signifieth a Prouince; as that a <HI>Marques</HI> should signifie the President of a Prouince. Others thinke it is deriued of the Dutch word (<HI>Marchk</HI>) among whom this title is in great honor, &amp; signifieth a <HI>Signor</HI> ouer a Country to some limit or marke, for so <HI>Altimeri</HI> in his <HI>Scholia</HI> vpon <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> interpreteth. As for this title of great Duke, there neuer was any before in <HI>Italy,</HI> nor I thinke in <HI>Europe,</HI> but he of <HI>Musconia:</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="23">
Of Dukes there be diuers in this Countrie of <HI>Italy,</HI> as the Dukes of <HI>Ferrara, Muntoua, Parma, Vrbino</HI>; besides foure and twenty in the kingdome of <HI>Naples.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning his claime and right to the Crowne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His title.</NOTE> it is beyond the compasse of a bare relation, (as this is) to dispute how good it is but rather to discourse what it is, neither to determine how iustly his Predecessors got it, but how lineally it is deuolued from the~ to him. The meanes how this house rose to such supe|rioritie in a co~mon-wealth, where was alwaies maintained such equallitie, is by the <HI>Florence</HI> historie easily discerned to be their popularity &amp; insinuatiue stealing into the peoples good opini|ons; ouer who~ they oftentimes in cases of insolencies &amp; oppres|sions by the nobler sort, vndertooke the Patronage, &amp; became as it were the <HI>Tribunes</HI> of the people in <HI>Rome,</HI> or the <HI>Auogadori del Commune</HI> in <HI>Venice,</HI> who (as I take it) are <HI>Aduocates</HI> &amp; <HI>Inter|cessors</HI> for the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tize~s, preferring their sutes to the Courts. How|beit there is a difference, for this is an office instituted, that was a fauor enchroched vpo~, this is by law limitted, that was by ma~s nature so infinite, as it staid not running on this plausible race till the wished goale was gotten. <HI>Venice</HI> hath beene wise in this case, where it hath been danger for a great man to deserue too well, and be loued too much; for which cause only (as in their <HI>Annals</HI> appeareth) some of the~ haue lost their liues, fearing what this popularitie of theirs might effect, if it were put to the triall: &amp; holding belike that principle good in a co~monwealth, which is a ground in matters of the Church, which saith; <HI>Melius est pe|vire vnu~ qua~ vnione~)</HI> It is better one perish then vnitie: factions being as da~gerous in the one, as schismes in the other. To which purpose <HI>Athens</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> can afford many fit examples, &amp; in|deed so many, as it were needlesse to recount, either that of <HI>Scil|la</HI> and <HI>Marius, Caesar</HI> and <HI>Pompeius, Octavius</HI> and <HI>Anthonius:</HI> or any other particulars, either of the one state or the other. And but that the (colours Noble and Popular) were in seuentie sixe in good time vnited in the Citty of <HI>Genoa</HI>; there had not wanted at this day an example in that Citty also, eyther of the family, <HI>Doria, Spinoli, Grimaldi,</HI> or <HI>Fieschi,</HI> as by <HI>Oberto Foglietta,</HI> a very iudiciall writer of these times is proued.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="24">But to returne to the history of the family <HI>Medici,</HI> it is to be vnderstood, that <HI>Lorenzo</HI> grand-child to the first <HI>Cosmo,</HI> who for his well deseruing of the Common-wealth was sir-named <HI>Pater Patriae,</HI> &amp; vncle to <HI>Clement</HI> the 7. who for deserts cleane contrary merited the title of <HI>Ruina Reipub:</HI> He I say, after the death of his brother <HI>Guigliano,</HI> who was slaine by the families <HI>Saluiati</HI> and <HI>Pazzi</HI> gouerned the State of <HI>Florence</HI> with all wis|dome grauitie and moderation, without respect of any parti|cular aduancement of his house, but onely of the weale pub|lick.

So ordinary and naturall a thing it is in the minde of man, in matter of ambition and greatnesse, to keepe no mediocrity, that when yee giue him the authority and commaund ouer few, and in small matters, he cannot list his vast thoughts within the limits prescribed, but is so carried beyond himselfe with a desire to rule, as without consideration either of vertue by which, or of friends by whom, he was ad|uanced;

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His Court.</NOTE> Concerning his Court, it is the generall opinion, that it is greater then of a Duke, lesse then of a King; which compared with other Dukes of <HI>Italy</HI> is true: howbeit if it be considered either what number of persons are therein, or what prouision there is made, I thinke it may hardly compare with the houses of the Nobility of <HI>England,</HI> comprehending in this nu~ber none but such as liue and haue their dyet in Court, whereof there be very few. For this Court doth yeeld two sorts of courtiers: <HI>della bocca, &amp; della Casa,</HI> (of the mouth and of the house) that is, of such as feede there, and of such as retaine onely. Of the first sort is the great Duke himselfe, the Duke <HI>Bracciano,</HI> their Dutches|ses, their children, and some few seruants besides to the number as I haue creadibly heard not aboue foure and twenty: of the other sort are other officers of Court, which notwithstanding liue at their owne priuate tables, as <HI>Monsignior Puteo</HI> Archbi|shop of <HI>Pisa,</HI> and thereto his Highnesse, by whose counsell he is especially aduised, <HI>Il Signior Piero Vsimbaldi, il signior Caualliere Conci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o, il Signior Beliario Vinta, il Signior Caualliere Serguidi, il signior Piero Conti</HI> his Secretaries, &amp; diuers others his officers.

<P>The order of this discourse requireth that in this place I brief|ly aduertise of the order of <HI>San Stephano,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His order of S. Ste|phen.</NOTE> whereof his highnesse is grand-master, which was first instituted by <HI>Cosmo</HI> his father, and confirmed by <HI>Pius Quintus.</HI> But because the ordinances &amp; statutes therof be very many, aswell concerning the inuestiture as degradation, &amp; for that there is a booke written thereof inti|tled <HI>della Religione di san Stephano:</HI> I will only remember that the <HI>Gran Maestro</HI> conferreth diuers other offices belonging to this order, and of chiefe accoumpt, vpon persons of principall qualitie in his state: as the office of <HI>Gran Comandator, Gran Con|testabile,</HI> and <HI>Gran Priore.</HI> There be three degrees of this order; the first is of <HI>Cauallieri querrieri,</HI> the second are <HI>Ecclesiastichi</HI>; the last <HI>Seruienti.</HI> Of the first sort haue beene made (as in their Pallace at <HI>Pisa</HI> appeareth) about one thousand and twenty. The second are Priests &amp; persons of the church, not so honourable as the former. The last are such as haue baser offices either a|bout the Pallace, or about their lands, and receiue annuall wa|ges for their paines. The <HI>Cognisance</HI> or badge of this order, is a crosse, in forme like that of the knights of <HI>Malta,</HI> but differing in colour, for that of <HI>Malta</HI> is white, this is red. They are bound to weare it alwayes vpon their vpper garment, which the great duke himselfe also obserueth. They are bound also to serue at Sea in the <HI>Grand</HI> Maisters warres for six yeares (as I take it) if need be whereas they of <HI>Malta</HI> are bound to serue against the Turke all the dayes of their life. The Knights of this order may marry, and hold temporall possessions, which they of <HI>Malta</HI> may not. This order is lineally to discend from the father to the eldest sonne, without any more creation, like the Titles of ho|nours in <HI>England,</HI> vnlesse his father vpon demerit be formerly degraded.

in <HI>England</HI> be many times deceiued in the reckoning, finding the accoumpt fall farre short of that the world iudged &amp; they themselues hoped: how easie a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng is it to erre in the valuing of so great a Prince as the great duke of <HI>Tuscany</HI>? Besides if one should vndertake to write of euery thing he hath seene, &amp; giue it the <HI>Italians</HI> valuation (who in matters of their owne, euer speake <HI>alla larga</HI>) I assure my selfe he should be very much de|ceiued, and gaine the imputation of a notable Gull for his cre|dulity, &amp; a notorious Bugiarde for his deliuery, against which, note his farre trauaile neither giues him warrant nor <HI>supersedeas.</HI> I was in a <HI>Florentines</HI> gallery, who hath sometimes beene in our Countrey, where besides one table of Tutch, and three other of Serpentine, Agate, and such like, very curiously wrought and bordered with flowers of their naturall colours (which might be painted for ought I knew): howbeit he protested they were all the naturall colours of the stone, and of the infinite charge it cost to cut so many, before they could finde such as should giue the true lustre of the flower, which surely is there done most liuely: and besides many Statues of Marble, Alabaster &amp; Brasse, he shewed vs a Cupbord of Boxes yet vnfinished (which he said) hath already cost foure and twenty thousand crownes: we see also diuers Medalles, at the least fiue hundred, which he valued some at twenty and thirty crownes the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eece: for the value of his Cupbord I know not, but for his Medalles I am sure that in <HI>Venice</HI> a man may buy as good and as Antique of a <HI>Montibanck</HI> for two gazets a peece, which is not two pence sterling. Now if one had swallowed this Gudgion of one hun|dred and twentie thousand Crownes (for so much he said these toyes in this Gallery did cost) he must needs either haue sur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e|ted of a fulnesse, or else haue discouered his infirmity by vent|ing it to others.</P>
<P>But to returne to the great Dukes riches; in the Gallery at <HI>Florence</HI> where is his <HI>Guarda-roba</HI> his Wardrope, and Armory, there is very much and massie Plate, with one Cupbord of pure gold, the value I cannot estimate. There is also one Table in making for the Emperour, which hath already cost (they say)
<PB N="41" REF="26">
twenty two thousand duckets set with very many &amp; very faire Stones. There is one Deske worth (as they dare affirme) one Million. There are likewise <HI>Rapiers</HI> with hilts of gould, and in their Pomels either the Spheres or Clockes very curiously wrought. There be swords so artificially made, that they may be throwne out the length of three, and being at the full length, it dischargeth a Pistoll: there is the Sword of <HI>Charlemaine</HI> greatly prized. There be Targets which with a Pinne turned make Daggers flie out of all sides. There are besides the diuers weapons of most Nations, with many other things for the rich|nesse and rarenesse worth the remembring, as also the great Dukes chaine of Diamonds, and the great Duchesses chaine of Pearle which they weare dayly, two iewels no doubt of excee|ding value: besides all other their iewels &amp; treasures not seene. But the thing which most argueth his Riches, and whereof he and other Princes haue their daily vses, and whereby they be valued, is ready Money and Coine; which the world (and no doubt vpon good reason) iudgeth to be very great: insomuch as the <HI>Neopolitan</HI> calleth him the King of coine: for in their play at <HI>Primero</HI> (their foure sutes of cardes being <HI>denari, Coppe, Spade, Picche, Coyne, Cuppes, Swords, Pikes</HI>) when (as the manner is) yee aske him for what Carde he pulleth, if he pull for a <HI>Denaro</HI> he answereth; I pull for the great Duke of <HI>Tuscany.</HI> And truely I am of opinion (submitting my selfe to better iudgments) that as in <HI>France</HI> there be foure great Riuers farre excelling the rest of that countrey in generall, and yet one another in some one particular: <HI>Loyre</HI> the greatest, <HI>Rhone</HI> the swiftest, <HI>Sayne</HI> the ri|chest, and <HI>Sone</HI> the sweetest. So in <HI>Italy</HI> there are foure great States, aboue all the other without exception, which notwith|standing in some one particular compared together, exceed one another. The Pope greatest in authoritie, the kingdome of <HI>Na|ples</HI> greatest in land-forces; the <HI>Venetians</HI> mightiest at Sea; and this great Duke mightiest in purse. Of whose present money some let not to say that he hath thirty millions of Duckets, others talke of fiue and twenty, none vnder twenty; but how truely, must be left to euery mans pleasure to iudge, as a thing vtterly vnknowne, except we may guide our coniectures by
<PB N="42" REF="27">
this inference, which may thus be collected.</P>
<P>Duke <HI>Francesco</HI> in the yeare 1576. reported to the <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassador, that his father <HI>Cosmo</HI> dying, left him in debt eight hundred thousand Duckets: for the paiment whereof he was forced to take vp great summes of the <HI>Genoeses,</HI> at vnreasonable interest. Notwithstanding it appeareth by the relation of the said Embassador, that within ten yeares after he was cleared of that debt, and had imbursed to his coffers fiue Millions. It may then be probably argued, that if in ten yeares there were six millions encrease, in twenty years more, there be at least twelue more added. But if it be obiected that Duke <HI>Francesco</HI> in the terme of those ten yeares had many hundred thousand duckets confiscate to his coffers by the treason of <HI>Pucci,</HI> who with his complices had plotted to enuite the Duke, the Cardinall, and <HI>Don Piero</HI> to a feast, and there to murder them all, and so to re|couer their liberty; It may hereto be answered that he was like|wise a Prince of very great expences, and that for instance in that very time, he built the Pallace and water-workes of <HI>Pra|tolino,</HI> which cost him at the least three hundred thousand duc|kets. As for this great Duke now liuing, his expences are small for so great a Prince, as by the small number of them which liue in Court may appeare. And yet euery <HI>Carneuale</HI> time he reti|reth himselfe from <HI>Florence,</HI> where is much to be spent, to <HI>Pisa</HI> where is somewhat to be gained: he saith he doth it for the af|fection he beareth that towne; his people say, for the loue he hath to spare; our English Marchants there say, it is for loue of their commodities, which about that time arriue, and are brought vp by his officers.</P>
<P>It is likewise knowne he hath great summes of money in banck, which must needs bring in their yearely gaine, besides three-score thousa~d duckets entrate, which he yearly detaineth from his brother <HI>Don Piere,</HI> who liueth in <HI>Spaine,</HI> &amp; the gaine of Wheate before remembred; all which with his yearly reuenue may make one strongly perswaded, that his ready money is lit|tle lesse then that which is iudged of them which rate it at the highest. I should surely thinke it an incredible masse, but that I haue read for certaine, that in the yeare 1592, the ready money
<PB N="43" REF="27">
of <HI>Amurath,</HI> father to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third, the great <HI>Turke</HI> now liuing, was at the least fifty millions. And although the dispro|portion of their Entrates may seeme much to weaken the force of this comparison: yet I see not, considering on the other side as great difference in their expenses, but that it may carry some good shew of likelyhood. To conclude this point, it appeareth, that the great Duke hath two Reuenues whereby he groweth rich; that is, great impositions, and great sparing (for sparing is a great reuenue.) There yet remaineth two other meanes to make him absolutely rich, the loue of his subiects, and their pri|uate wealth (for the wealth of the Subiect is the wealth of the king, and where the people is rich, the Prince is not poore. But sure it is that he hath neither the one, nor they the other.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His forces.</NOTE> It is to be thought that he which hath money such store wan|teth no forces (for money is called the sinews of warre) I will therefore to this short discourse of his Riches, adde in a word what is thought of his forces. His strength at Sea is not great, for he hath not aboue six Galleys, neither hath had since the ouerthrowe that the Turkes gaue him at the little Ilands <HI>For|miche,</HI> where he lost two of his best Galleys and one Galleon. In these that remaine he hath besides Munition ordinary, (that is eight or ten a peece,) about two hundred Souldiers and eight hundred slaues. He hath also much good Munition, and a competent number of Souldiers in his Fortes of the <HI>Porto Fer|rario,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Potto Ferario</NOTE> in the Iland of <HI>Elba:</HI> of which place his Father was im|patronized by the Lord thereof, the <HI>Signor di Piombino,</HI> with the consent of <HI>Charles</HI> the fift: both because the Patron therof was not able to defend it against the <HI>Corsari</HI> which daily rob|bed and spoyled it: as also, because for the small defence it had, it might haue fallen into the hands of the Turkes, and so by reason of the Scite (standing very fitly for such a purpose) it might haue preiudiced the whole country of <HI>Italy.</HI> Notwith|standing all the reuenue of the Isle is left free to the Lord of <HI>Pi|ombino,</HI> &amp; vnder his command are all other the towns &amp; vnfor|tified places.

touch, as in a place as necessary, fit, and secure, as are the <HI>Terse|res</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> failing to the West-Indies: so that if he with this Isle had also a good number of Galleis and a purpose to offend, he might very easily infest all the Seas vpon the coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> vpon <HI>Pronence, Lyguria, Tuscania,</HI> and all that side of <HI>Italie,</HI> and in a manner make himselfe Lord of those Mid-land Seas. He hath also (as is reported) one hundred Soldiers, &amp; good Artillerie in a Fort he holdeth at <HI>Marseilles</HI> called <HI>Castle dite</HI>; by the sufferance of which peece the <HI>Genoeses</HI> ship was in <HI>Ianuary</HI> last taken, (wherof the parties grieued complained lately to the great Duke) where besides foure hundred <HI>Spaniards</HI> put to the Gallies, was also found foure hundred thousand crownes, sent thether from <HI>Spaine.</HI> He hath also in those thirty Castles and Fortes before spoken of (wherein are garrisons but very small, as in some fiftie, and in others fiue and twentie, in others not aboue fifteene &amp; in some fewer by reason of the good tearmes he standeth in with his neighbours Princes, or at least by the good fauour of the time, for that they be otherwise diuerted, that would be busie, to the number of six hundred in all. He hath likewise in all his sixteene Citties, garrisons of Souldiers more or lesse, as in the Cyttadell <HI>S.

In all which places he is said to be very well prouided of Munition, Armour, weapons, Powder, shott, and such like military proui|sion; the certaine quantity wherof I cannot certainly enforme, because, but vpon especiall fauour, and by commandement, they dare not let one come into their Fortes. And to write what others say, were to erre himselfe and seduce others. I was by good meanes in the Castle at <HI>Liuorno,</HI> where I told of field pee|ces three-score and foure, whereof (they told me) that twelue were canon, and demi-canon; by which proportion it is to be coniectured that he is very well furnished.</P>
<P>These Souldiers of whom is already spoken, are all in pay; he hath also a <HI>Rassegna,</HI> his trained Souldier (as we in <HI>England</HI> call them) about the number whereof there is great difference, between that which is writte~ by way of relation, &amp; that which
<PB N="45" REF="28">
is by way of conference reported. Relations (the~ which nothing is more false) write that there be thirty six thousand: but I talk|ed with a Captaine, who hath the mustering &amp; charge of three hundred within the precincts of <HI>Prato</HI> (then whom no man should know better) and he tolde me but of fifteene thousand. In this diuersitie of report I haue no other guide to direct me, to whether of these I should giue credit, then by a rateable pro|portion of the part with the whole, to inferre whether of these two commeth nearer to the trueth, in this manner. It is now certainly holden, that the number of people in the States of <HI>Florence</HI> and <HI>Siena</HI> vnited together, are about eight hundred thousand, and that they which recken six in the one &amp; fiue in the other, and so make one million and one hundred thousand, do somewhat ouershoot the true number, much more they that recken 800000. in the state of <HI>Florence,</HI> and 600000. in that of <HI>Siena,</HI> not considering that the people of <HI>Siena</HI> and <HI>Pisa</HI> with their precincts are much decayed, as hath already beene partly said. Now then if sixteene thousand people (the number of the~ within the <HI>distretto</HI> (the precincts) of <HI>Prato</HI>) do allow the great Duke a <HI>Rassegna</HI> of three hundred, which I haue seene foure times trained (for they muster and are exercised once a month throughout his state) then eight hundred thousand will allow fifteene thousand after that rate. But if it be answered that vpon the frontiers of the church and in the <HI>Maremma,</HI> there is a grea|ter <HI>Rassegna</HI> then in other places, and so the proportion not to hold, I reply, to answer this with sufficient recompence, there is no mustering of Souldiers nor any <HI>Rassegna</HI> in the cittie of <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> which is a good part of the whole. So that of this I am sure, that in <HI>Florence, Prato, Pistoia, Pisa,</HI> &amp; their territories, there are not in all aboue two thousand two hundred&punc; I should ther|fore thinke it strange and very disproportionate, that there should be aboue twenty thousand in all. It may be demanded why they of <HI>Florence</HI> are not trained aswell as the rest; the rea|son is, <HI>manet alta mente reposta tyrannis Papae, &amp; consensus Impera|toris,</HI> Pope <HI>Clements</HI> vsurping, and <HI>Charles</HI> the fifts consent, sticks still in their stomacks. For they haue not yet forgot that their fathers were free &amp; commanders ouer others) &amp; therfore
<PB N="46" REF="29">
they are not onely preuented of this meanes which peraduen|ture at sometime or other they might take, but they be also de|barred the hauing of any Armes in their houses, or of wearing any weapon by their sides, except he be a knight of the order, or a trained Souldier, or an officer, or one that hath especiall li|cence for the same, whereof there be many Gentlemen in <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> according to the fauour they haue with the Prince, and as he is secured of them. The like is through the whole state, in|somuch as many will sue to be trained Souldiers (a thing which with vs they would gladly auoide) because they might be pri|uiledged to weare weapon, but especially (which is also a free|dome granted to men of this profession) because they might not be arrested for debt.</P>
<P>His forces at Sea and land are these already remembred, be|side one hundred Launces which he keepeth in <HI>Siena,</HI> &amp; some fiftie light horse in his owne stables at <HI>Florence,</HI> besides foure hundred more in other places of his state.</P>
<P>His <HI>Entrate,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">His entrate</NOTE> is by diuerse men diuersly estimated, some say one Million and a halfe, others one Million and a hundred thousand, and some there be that say it is as much as both these summes. Howsoeuer it may be thought that the least of these is a great matter for so small a State, whether we call it small in regarde of the circuite, the number of the People; or lastly the barrennesse of the soile, out of which the Subiects wealth and Princes Taxes should be raised. This may well be proued by comparing this state with that of the Duke of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> which is not much lesse in continent then this of the great Duke, and the soile generally much more fruitful, yet is the reuenue of this great Duke almost thrice as much as that other. An apparant argument of the ouer-charging of his people by Taxations &amp; impositions more then their neighbours: yet are the subiects of the state of <HI>Venice</HI> lesse charged then these, &amp; they vnder the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> least of all; onely they of the kingdome of <HI>Na|ples</HI> haue as much cause to complaine as the <HI>Tuscanes,</HI> or any other subiects in <HI>Italy</HI> whatsoeuer.

<P>All which together make the summe of 1095000. which within fiue thousand Duckets agreeth with the said sum.</P>
<P>This accompt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hall appeare not to swarue much, if we exa|mine each particular. First for the Toll of the gates of <HI>Florence</HI> and custome out of the <HI>Dogana,</HI> it is apparently knowne that the great Duke lets it out at two hundred thousand Duckets the yeare at the least, reckoning withall of all other impositions one fourth part of that whole State, which is probably suppo|sed to be gathered hereout. There is paid also throughout the whole state, eight <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the hundred for marriages, as if the woma~s portion be a thousa~d duckets, the Prince hath thereout eighty. The like proportion is paid for buying &amp; selling of houses or land. But the letting of houses or land payeth the tenth: for Cattell bought and sold, he hath also a <HI>guiglio,</HI> that is six-pence Sterling in euery two Duckets, and though the Beasts be
<PB N="48" REF="30">
bought and sold twice in one houre, he hath still after the same rate. Furthermore, besides his impositions vpon the Bancks, he hath at euery alienation eight in the hundred&punc; that is, when the father or possessor dieth, the sonne or next heires payeth after this rate for his patrimony left him. He hath also an entrate out of the <HI>Burdello</HI> stewes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burdello.</NOTE> which is thought at the least thirty thou|sand crownes a yeare in <HI>Florence</HI> onely there being some eight thousand Curtizans in the towne, these pay euery moneth a li|uer nine-pence sterling to the great Duke, because heere the market is somewhat quick, though in <HI>Siena</HI> they pay but a <HI>gui|glio</HI> monthly, they pay also a <HI>Liuer</HI> a moneth not to weare the yellow list the badge of their trade, if they stand out of the <HI>Bur|dello,</HI> if they be priuiledged to go to any mans lodging, or if they weare mans apparell, for each of these priuiledges they pay <HI>Gabell</HI> also. The Iewes here also from fifteene yeares vp|ward, pay two Duckets the yeare.</P>
<P>Concerning the <HI>Gabell</HI> vpon bread,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bread.</NOTE> true it is, that he hath vp|on euery Stay that is ground two <HI>Crazie,</HI> three halfe-pence of ours, so that by this rate he hath of euery quarter of our mea|sure, the summe of eighteene-pence of our money. If then it be supposed that euery one in the state of <HI>Florence</HI> eate twelue <HI>Staia</HI> a yeare, which is as before a proportion ordinary, the summe will not much differ from the rate of one hundred and twenty thousand Duckets.</P>
<P>Concerning the flesh,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flesh.</NOTE> it is to be vnderstood, that the great duke hath for euery pound that is eaten fiue <HI>denari,</HI> whereof 20. make a <HI>Crazia,</HI> so that he hath of euery Stone that is eaten of our weight, the value of three-pence of our money.</P>
<P>He hath vpon euery pound of Salt spent, ten <HI>quattrini</HI> gaine, that is three halfe-pence of our money: so that after the rate of foure and twenty <HI>Moggia</HI> the day, for three hundred dayes in a yeare, allowing the other sixtie fiue for holly-dayes, he gaines two hundred and sixteene thousand, seauen hundred sixtie one Duckets, whereof allowing almost one halfe for the state of <HI>Siena,</HI> because there he hath no imposition vpon Salt, the sum will accord very neerely with the particular abouesaid.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="30">As for the <HI>Dogana</HI> of <HI>Lyuorno,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Dogana of Lyuorno.</NOTE> being the Gate as it were through which all marchandize passe into those parts of <HI>Italy:</HI> and for <HI>Siena,</HI> be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng the roade from <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> it is to be credibly supposed, that both the one and the other yeeld no lesse benefit to the Prince then is aboue rated; the like is to be thought of the other Citties.</P>
<P>But ouer and besides all this, it is to be considered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gabel by Pole.</NOTE> that in the whole state of <HI>Siena</HI> he hath a <HI>Gabell</HI> by the Pole as we call it in <HI>England,</HI> that is vpon euery head a certaine rate, (I thinke eighteene-pence) besides an allowance for feeding of their cat|tell, whereof in this State is reasonable good store, much more then in that of <HI>Florence,</HI> whose wants it supplyeth, especially of Swine, by reason of their grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> store of Mast, for which they pay halfe a ducket the Swine, whereas in times past they paide but one <HI>guiglio:</HI> they pay also for the killing eighteene-pence, and other such like impositions. Insomuch as talking with two Gentlemen of <HI>Siena</HI> concerning these matters, men of good qualitie and experience, they auowed that the great Duke had as good as a Ducket vpon euery masted Swine before he come to the owners table. They farther alleaged, that howsoeuer they were exempt from the <HI>Gabell</HI> of the <HI>Macina</HI> as they call it, that is of paying for their Meale, Salt, and Flesh, yet notwith|standing all things considered&punc; their burthen was no whit ligh|ter then their neighbours of the other State, that paid all these. To which purpose they protested, that of their <HI>Villa</HI> which they let to halfe to the <HI>Contadmo</HI> (the labourer) there fell not in the reckoning, (all taxes, tallages, and impositions defalked) aboue one third to themselues, another to the Fermar, and the rest to the Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nce. A strange proportion we may thinke, that liue in such blessed happinesse, and farre beyond all Taxes, Subsidies and Priuy-seales whatsoeuer. But what compare I the heauy <HI>Dinasty</HI> of small <HI>Tuscany,</HI> with the flourishing Mo|narchy, and happy gouernment of great <HI>Brittany.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Camere Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ande, and Inne|keepers.</NOTE> He hath also no small matter of the <HI>Camere Locande</HI> lodg|ings for strangers, and the Innes in the State; of some fortie, of others fiftie, &amp; of some foure-score Duckets, euery third yeare:
<PB N="50" REF="31">
he hath also in some places his Bake-houses, where the Inne|keepers are enioyned to take their bread of him. Though this exaction be so great vpon the Innes at <HI>Florence,</HI> and in the road way to <HI>Rome,</HI> notwithsta~ding in <HI>Pisa</HI> the yoake is not so heauy, there the manner of raising the <HI>Gabell</HI> is thus. At euery three yeares end, all the Inne-keepers in the Cittie are to appeare at a Court in the <HI>Dogana</HI> kept for that purpose. There it is cryed by the Officer, that such, and such an Inne, paide these last three yeares so many Duckets to the Prince, who biddeth more? There is a Candle set vp light and while that lasteth, it is law|full to lone and bid for the same, and he that biddeth most shall haue it. Wherein this one thing may seeme more strange, then that which hath beene already enformed concerning a mans Corne, that in some cases he cannot make his prouision of his owne; for here if another will giue more for the Inne then I, though the house be mine owne, he shall haue it, paying me onely my rent, and I shall be forced to seeke another. I haue onely this priuiledge aboue another, that I offering as much as he, I shalbe first serued. The Inne-keeper of <HI>Pisa</HI> where lye our English Marchants, auowed this to be most true; he paieth for these three yeares forty Duckets. His Highnesse hath also vpo~ all things sold in shops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matricula.</NOTE> a <HI>Matricula</HI> (as they call it) which is not to be paied euery yeare, but onely once, when the shop keeper setteth vp; which in some shops commeth at least to an hun|dred duckets. One that selleth stockings, trusses, shirts, sockes &amp; such trash, told me that at his first beginning he paid his <HI>Ma|tricula</HI> for Wollen cloath twenty <HI>Florens</HI>; for Linnen cloath as much, and for Buttons Silke and Threed as much, which in all commeth to thirty gold crownes. To conclude this point, there is not that trade, nor that man or woman whatsoeuer, but of them this Prince hath his Tribute, more or lesse, not so much but the poore seely widow, which the whole yeare Spinneth, payeth seauenteene Solls, that is about eight-pence Ster|ling.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lazaretto.</NOTE> I haue not heard of any that are free but the <HI>Lazaretton</HI> or Hospidall, &amp; the begger that goeth from doore to doore only;
<PB N="51" REF="31">
for (which hath partly beene said) there is not that poore Asses burthen of dung that go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">th out the gat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, nor that Radish roote that commeth in, that paieth not his <HI>Gabell</HI>; except they haue the cunning to deceiue them that keepe the gates, men whose eyes will pearce what <HI>Veligia</HI> or basket soeuer: and if it chance they be detected, they loose the thing hidden without redemp|tion. I saw a poore <HI>Contadina</HI> Countrey-woman, who com|ming to the gate to pay her tolle for a Basket of Lettice she brought in: one of the foxes who I thinke could smell a goose, for he could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> possible see any, searched vnder the hearbes, and finding one dead without feathers, sent the poore woman away ha'fe dead for sorrow, without her goose. And they told me, that if a Gentleman of <HI>Siena</HI> should come out at <HI>Florence</HI> gates, with a chaine of gold new bought about his neck, how|beit worne betweene his doublet and Ierkin that it might not be seene to saue the <HI>gabell,</HI> that being discouered he should not loose his Chaine onely, but his horse also.</P>
<P>Concerning all the taxes and impositions, certaine it is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imposions and Taxes ordinary.</NOTE> that they which rate the great Dukes <HI>Entrate</HI> at eleuen hundred thousand Duckets, comprehend onely such as are ordinary &amp; certaine but of the rest which stand on casualty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Casualty.</NOTE> and are vncer|taine they cannot determine. And sure I am of this, that besides many particulers heere remembred, as also the Rents and Re|uenues of his proper lands belonging by many descents to him, of others not accounted in this valuation of his yearely <HI>Entrate,</HI> there is yet one thing behinde vntouched or thought of by others, which will appeare no small matter, and is this.</P>
<P>In euery Citty and towne corporate (as I may say) in <HI>Tuscanie</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Co~munita</NOTE> there was before their subiection to the family <HI>Medici</HI> a <HI>Co~mu|nit&agrave;</HI> that is, an <HI>Entrate</HI> in co~mon of the Citty, by which all pub|lick charges were defrayed, all officers maintained, and many other good and charitable workes performed. This <HI>Entrate</HI> arose vpon the Tenths &amp; Tithes of euery mans crop or fruite: (for in <HI>Tuscany</HI> the parish Priest hath them not, he hath onely his offering &amp; Church-rights, with a house and some certaine ground thereto belonging; as yee would say Glebe-land.)
<PB N="52" REF="32">
It grew also vpon the bread and flesh, thus; euery file of bread as they terme it, cost a <HI>quatrino</HI> the signing, euery Bullock cost foure <HI>Liuers</HI> the killing, euery Swine two, euery Weather cost two <HI>guigly,</HI> There were also in times past people of charitable disposition, who dying without children made the <HI>Communit&agrave;</HI> their he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to their goods and land, which they call the <HI>Entrate</HI> of the <HI>Geppo,</HI> that is, the Stock, and is a member of the <HI>Commu|nist.</HI> Now that which did yearely remaine of the <HI>Entrate,</HI> all charges deducted, was put to the common Treasurie for to helpe in time of dearth or warre, or such like publick necessity. An example hereof I will take the towne of <HI>Prato.</HI> Here the <HI>Entrate</HI> of the <HI>Communit&agrave;</HI> is twenty six thousand Duckets the yeare,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceppo.</NOTE> the <HI>Entrate</HI> of the <HI>Ceppo</HI> is eight thousand, in all thirty foure; hereout they allow the <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">desta</HI> one thousand, the Cap|taine of the trained Souldiers, six hundred, the Chauncellor fiue hundred, they allow for a feast euery two moneths among the eight <HI>Pricori</HI> at the choosing of their <HI>Gonfalioniere</HI> twenty duc|kets. They allow their Iudge, who is a Doctor of the Ciuill law, fiue hundred,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Catchpols.</NOTE> also the wages of the <HI>Bargello</HI> and <HI>Sbirri</HI> (as one would say the Vnder-shiriffe and his Sergeants) the wages of the Trumpetters, the stipend of foure Schoole-ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sters, the sa|larie of two Phisitions and two Chirurgions, the keeping often Schollers at the Vniuersitie in <HI>Pisa,</HI> also the maintaining of two Hospitals, one of Bastards th'other of sick, aged, and impotent persons, whereof there are in all to the number of three hun|dred and fiftie: besides the giuing of portions to poore maides that are married from hence, or to young boyes that are put to some occupation, as also the Almes euery Friday of fourteene <HI>Staia</HI> of Corne, two barrels of Wine, and one of Vineger giuen to the poorer sort. And lastly that which they giue to the <HI>Poue|ri Vergognosi,</HI> that is, such housholders as are poore and are a|shamed to beg, whereof there is consideration had by the foure that are in office for that purpose: These and all other their common charges, as trimming of Churches, repairing of Brid|ges, mending of high wayes, and such like, being defrayed, it is certaine, that there yearely remaineth one fourth part' at the
least:<PB N="53" REF="32">
which now goeth not to the common treasure, as in times past, but to the great dukes coffers: the like is to be said of all other places in this Dukedome.</P>
<P>But it is to be obserued, that before this money which resul|teth of the <HI>Communit&agrave;</HI> be carryed to <HI>Florence</HI> to the dukes Ex|chequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monte di Pieta.</NOTE> it is put into the <HI>Monte di Piet&agrave;</HI> the Bancke of Pitty: a place where any poore man may pawne his houshold stuffe, or cloathes, or whatsoeuer els is worth money (prouided al|wayes the gage be worth more then the money) he taketh this money he hath for a day and a yeare after fiue in the hundred. And if at the time he returne not to redeeme the thing enga|ged, it is sold by Trumpet, for what can be gotten where-out the principall and interest being taken, the poore man shall haue the rest. So that the great Duke hauing this ouerplus, for now it is their Prouerbe, <HI>Il'Duca &egrave; la Communit&agrave;</HI> in euery Citty and great towne, and the vse besides for the money, which will amount to a round summe through the whole State (for there be of these Banckes in euery place) it is to be coniectured, that his whole <HI>Entrate</HI> is a greater matter then it is ordinarily taken for, of them who esteeme it at one Million and one hundred thousand Duckets, I should rather condiscend to them, that rate it at one Million and a halfe.</P>
<P>Concerning his expenses it is harder to guesse at,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His expen|ces.</NOTE> then his <HI>Entrate</HI> those of the Duke <HI>Francesco</HI> were supposed about fiue hundred thousand Duckets; these of this Duke they say be much lesser. And as the Duke his brother had diuers Captaines and men of commaund his Stipendaries, who receiued of him some three thousand fiue hu~dred duckets the yeare, some three thousand, some two, and some lesse, according to their nobility, and the qualitie of the place, wherein they had charge, so is it to be thought, that the Generall of the foote, the Collonell of his horse, the generall of his Galleis, and other inferiour Comman|ders, who vpon occasion are bound to serue him in their pla|ces, are with sufficient pension rewarded, each particulers pen|sion, how much it is without more certaine information then I had, I dare not presume to say: choosing rather to be defectiue
<PB N="54" REF="33">
in a generallity, then being too particuler to erre.</P>
<P>As for his expence vpon his troope of horse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His expe~ce on horse.</NOTE> the Lance hath 7. <HI>Piastras</HI> (1. fiue shillings 3. pence a peece) a moneth, the light|horseman hath three now in the time of peace, in warres a bet|ter proportion. The Souldier in all his garrisons hath foure <HI>Pi|astras</HI> a moneth, the officers proportionate, each in his place to this rate. As for the trained Souldier, he is (in peace) no charge to the Duke for he findeth himselfe shot, powder, armour, wea|pon, and all things necessary, and is bound to keepe them in good order; the Captaines and officers of these are paid out of the <HI>Communit&agrave;</HI> as hath beene abouesaid. The charge of his Galleys allowing (as <HI>Don Antonio Doria</HI> in his discourse how to resist the Turke at Sea doth proportion, that is,) each moneth fiue hundred gold crownes a Galley, co~meth in the halfe yeare which time they be commonly at Sea, to the sum of eighteene thousand gold crownes. The charge of his Court, as by the number of persons therein aboue enformed, may be collected, cannot be great. I haue heard one of his seruants say, that the Steward is allowed for <HI>Spezierie,</HI> Spicery, fifteene thousand duckets, &amp; that all other charges may treble so much more. As for all officers of Court, but these few before remembred, they feede at their owne tables; His Pages (which are Gentlemens sonnes of the Citty, or other places) in number as I take it six|teene, are at his charges kept at Schoole &amp; at dyet in the Citty: His <HI>Staffieri</HI> or Footemen are allowed six <HI>Piastras</HI> the moneth, they are about thirty. His guarde of <HI>Swisses</HI> haue foure <HI>Piastras</HI> the moneth; both these and they feed at their owne charge, or soiorne at some place, for they haue no allowance out of the dukes kitchin, not so much but the Cookes as I haue heard, ha|uing done their office, go to their owne houses to meat. A buil|der this duke is not at <HI>Liuorno,</HI> where indeed is very great cost bestowed, &amp; very many daily working: howbeit considering the labour of his Galley-slaues, which all the winter are there imploied, and of many poore men in the country which vpon light faults are thither confined, whose labour he hath paying nothing, it may appeare the charge is not halfe so much as it
<PB N="55" REF="33">
would cost another. There are also to be considered these ex|penses, which they call <HI>spese segrete,</HI> secret charges, &amp; no doubt are very great, for that this Prince maketh his way to many ef|fects of much importance by money; as namly in the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> where although the Pope that now is was chose~ without the good wil, or rather quite against the desire of this Prince, &amp; although the family <HI>Aldobrandini</HI> was alwaies an empeacher of the <HI>Medicies</HI> greatnesse, and though likewise the father of this Prince executed the father of this Pope; and albeit lastly this Pope desireth nothing more, then that by his meanes his natiue countrey might recouer her former liberty yet notwithsta~ding so strong is this Princes faction in that Colledge, and so many his friends by meanes of his money, as he resteth secured from any such danger.

<P>An instance of this we had this Ianuary last past,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The dukes kinde re|spect of the English.</NOTE> which I the rather remember to make knowne, what care his highnesse hath to giue our countrey good satisfaction, of whom all Eng|lish Gentlemen receiue very gracious fauours, as to be admitted to the presence at any <HI>Veglia,</HI> Reuells, or other time of extraor|dinary sight, also to haue the priuiledge to weare Armes, and other such like. An <HI>English</HI> Gent'eman was by a base groome of the house where he lodged, throwne into the <HI>Arno,</HI> for the money he was supposed to haue in his lodging; the offender, vpon suspition being apprehended, and receiuing the <HI>Strappa|do</HI> diuers times, and in the highest degree, notwithstanding per|sisted obstinately in the deniall. The lawe is there that except he confesse the fact he cannot be executed, how pregnant so euer the presumption be against him; insomuch it was thought he should haue beene discharged: wherevpon the court sent to his Highnesse for direction; he returned them order to vse all manner of torments which possible, or in any cases that court could inflict, and if yet he would not confesse to torture him till he dyed. According to this commission they gaue him the <HI>Sueglia,</HI> a kinde of torture, where hauing receiued a drinke to procure sleepe, the Tortures euer when he noddeth whip him with small plummets, he sitteth bare vpon an Yron like the back of a knife and hott Brickes vnder his feete to burne him, if he would ease himselfe that way. It is reported he endured this also, till they came to giue him <HI>L'Arco</HI> the Bowe, at which he confessed. This done he is carried before the court, there freely to say, whether he confessed for feare of torment, or that it is the very truth he said: if he auowe it, they proceed to iudg|ment,
<PB N="58" REF="35">
if otherwise, he is returned to the torture; for this is the onely way to proceed as is before said, how apparent soeuer the matter be, vnlesse it be proued by two witnesses. As for wit|nesse, it is there hard to be had, being holden a dishonourable thing to be a witnesse, or an enformer, a <HI>Spia,</HI> as they terme it. Insomuch as if an offence be committed in the streetes in the view of diuers Gentlemen, though they were not of the action, no nor of the company, notwithstanding they shall haue the <HI>Strappado</HI> to confesse the matter, which rather then doe, they will suffer. So that to haue the <HI>Strappado,</HI> in <HI>Florence</HI> is no dispa|ragement, except the cause make it so. But to returne to this matter, which I haue of purpose reme~bred, to make it appeare how these courts euen in small matters receiue directions from the Prince. After this fellow had auouched to the Court that he did the fact, they sent againe to his Highnesse to know how they should proceed. He returned, that the malefactor should loose his right hand at the doore where was the Gentlemans lodging, and from thence to be drawne to the place of Exe|cution, there to be hanged and quartered, which was accor|dingly performed.</P>
