<P>MY L. <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> arived here on Thur&s;|day la&s;t, to my Lord Generals great comfort, and the whole troupes. Barron <HI>Tilley</HI> &s;trengthened with his fre&s;h &s;upplies, which were 5000. foote and 1000. hor&s;e, marched towardes the Maine, to hinder Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> and Marquis <HI>Baden,</HI> from meeting with the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick.</HI> Now the pa&s;&s;age aimed at on both &s;ides was <HI>A&s;henburge</HI> a Towne of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ments</HI> vpon the Maine, where there is a Bridge. The Count <HI>Mansfeilds</HI> Army came about <HI>Darm&s;tat,</HI> one Thur&s;day was &s;evennight, and there &s;taid the comming of the Mar|quis which was Sunday: to conclude it was Teu&s;day before they marched from their quarters, in the <HI>Lantgraues</HI> Countrey towards this <HI>A&s;henburge,</HI> when beeing by <HI>Dippergen</HI> a &s;mall Towne, which ran&s;om|med it &s;elfe at 15000. <HI>Lor.</HI> adverti&s;ement came of the Barron <HI>Tillies</HI> hauing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed

him&s;elfe of the pa&s;&s;age, and that hee mar|ched directly towards them with a great power, weied to bee (by the coniecture) of the Barron <HI>Anhalts</HI> forces and mo&s;t of <HI>Gon&s;ales</HI> with him 30000. and the hor&s;e ful|ly armed from top to toe as they &s;ay. Our Armie then thought of a faire retrait, and applied to it by the &s;ame way they advan|ced, and lay the &s;ame night in Armes: on Wedne&s;day they retreated towards <HI>Openhe|im</HI> bridg and lodged about <HI>Girah.</HI> On thur&s;|day (which was a very great march) they came on this &s;ide <HI>Ben&s;heim,</HI> The Enemie all this while following without any thing done, on Fryday morning our two Ar|mies hauing &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elues, mar|ched by &s;everall pa&s;&s;ages to <HI>Lore&s;h,</HI> lea&s;t the enemie &s;hould cut betweene them and <HI>Mainhem,</HI> but were no &s;ooner ri&s;en, but the Enemie appeared, and with a body of Cai|ra&s;&s;iers, charged the rereward of the Mar|quis of <HI>Baden,</HI> wher his Lieutenant General Colonell <HI>Gol&s;tein</HI> a man much lamented for his courage and vnder&s;tanding was at the fir&s;t &s;hot &s;laine.

that hee is liuing &s;hot in the head, but not mortally, and his hor&s;e put to the wor&s;e, but the pre&s;&s;e of the enemy was kept vp by the Rereward of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> hor&s;e, the Regiment of Colo|nell <HI>Megant,</HI> and were forced to a di&s;or|derly retreat. Note the enemies foote ne|uer came vp, which if they had, the whole mu&s;t needes haue beene engaged. Thus skirmi&s;hing continued in the rere &s;omewhat &s;harpely by fits, till towardes night: the danger on euery &s;ide was by the Chiefes vigilance preuented, and the e&s;timate of men &s;laine on both &s;ides is betweene 3. or 4. hundred, but till a par|ticular view bee taken of the particular companies by each Captaine, the iu&s;t number of tho&s;e that are wanting can|not be knowne.
