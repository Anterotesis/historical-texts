<HEAD>A TRVE AND particular relation of the Newes &s;ent from <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> the 21. of Fe|bruary, Anno. 1603. <HI>Stilo nouo,</HI> concerning the fight of fiue Dutche &s;hippes, in the Ea&s;t Indies, a|gain&s;t the Portugall Fleete, con&s;i&s;ting of eight great Gallions, and 22. Galleyes, both great and &s;mall: whereof was Ad|mirall <HI>Don Andreas Fartado Mendo&s;a.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SIr, I haue hitherto &s;ignified vnto you tho&s;e Newes (whiche I had heard of &s;undrie per&s;ons) brought by the Pin|nace from the Ea&s;t Indies, but now, fora&s;much as the Mai&s;ter of the Pin|nace him&s;elfe (called <HI>Cornelis Schon|tein</HI>) arriued here ye&s;ternight, certi|fying vs of all by word of mouth, ther|fore I haue written vnto you more certainly and particular|ly thereof. To wit. That the fiue &s;hippes which &s;ayled and departed hence, in the yeare 1601. on the 23. day of A|prill (whereof was Admirall <HI>Wollfert Hermans,</HI>) arriued in the &s;treight of <HI>Sunda,</HI> on Chri&s;tmas day, in the &s;aide yeare 1601. where they were aduerti&s;ed and warranted by a
<PB N="4" REF="3"> &s;mall <HI>Chini&s;h</HI> Shippe, that before <HI>Bantam</HI> laie a Portingall Armade or Nauie, conteining eight great Galleons, and 22. Galleyes, great and &s;mall, which had laine before the Towne a day or two.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Dutche Admirall cau&s;ed his &s;aid fiue &s;hippes to ca&s;t Anker, and tooke coun&s;ell together for their better re&s;olution in their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. And becau&s;e you may knowe what, and how many &s;hippes they had in companie to at|tempt &s;uch, and &s;o great an enterpri&s;e, I will rehear&s;e and &s;et downe their names, and burthen of the &s;ame.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>One &s;hippe of the burthen of 520. tunnes, called <HI>Guelder|land.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One &s;hippe of the burthen of 400. tunnes, called the <HI>Sea|land.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One &s;hippe of the burthen of 240. tunnes, called <HI>Vtrecht.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One &s;hippe of the burthen of 120. tunnes, called the <HI>Watch|ter.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>One &s;hippe of the burthen of 50. tunnes, called the <HI>Doue.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Their re&s;olution was, that they &s;hould a&s;&s;aile and fight with the &s;aid Armade or Nauie with their Ordinance: In handling whereof, our men apter, and farre better practi&s;ed then the Portingalles, determining &s;o to cha&s;e them from their &s;iege: wherevpon they &s;et &s;ayle, and the next day early in the morning, they beganne to fight with the Portingales &s;hippes, and &s;o with great force and re&s;olution on both &s;ides, they maintained this maner of fight with their Ordinance, not only the &s;ame whole day, but 6. or 7. dayes after, vntill the fir&s;t day of Ianuary in the yeare 1602. and tooke the &s;ame time from the &s;aid Portingales, two Galleyes, and thr&eacute;e Galleyes which were wonderfully battered and briu|&s;ed with the &s;hot of our fiue &s;hippes.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>After that they them&s;elues had &s;et them on fire, &s;uffering them to driue downe the Riuer vpon our &s;hippes, meaning thereby to hinder or rather to burne our &s;hippes, but God be prai&s;ed they effected no hurt at all.</P>
<P>Finally, the Portingalles &s;&eacute;eing no good i&s;&s;ue like to fall on their &s;ide, left their &s;iege of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and departed to the Ile of <HI>Ambona,</HI> on the one &s;ide whereof, they haue a Ca&s;tle, which they &s;trongly fortified, and haue cut downe all the Cloues Tr&eacute;es, and pulled them vp by the rootes, or at the lea&s;twi&s;e de&s;troied as many of y^e trees as they could, commit|ting likewi&s;e a mo&s;t great, wicked, terrible, and cruell mur|ther vpon the poore inhabitants of the &s;ame Ile, the right na|ture and condition of Tyrants, which are accu&s;tomed to v&s;e crueltie vpon poore di&s;armed men and naked creatures, when they dare not defend, nor reuenge them&s;elues vpon their enemies. This is the great credit which this victorious <HI>Don Andreas Fartado Mendo&s;a</HI> with his Armade or Nauie hath gotten.</P>
<P>Truly, it is onely the Lorde God which gaue &s;o great courage and magnanimitie to the hearts of our people, with &s;o &s;mall a power of weake men to a&s;&s;aile and ouerthrow &s;o great and mightie a Fl&eacute;ete in compari&s;on of ours, to which mercifull, louing, and omnipotent God, be all laude, prai&s;e and glorie. Amen.</P>
<P>Our &s;hippes remained nine dayes at <HI>Bantam,</HI> proui|ding them&s;elues of all nece&s;&s;aries, where they were wel|come, and with great ioy and gladne&s;&s;e, receiued both great and &s;mall, the rea&s;on thereof was, becau&s;e they thought that the Portingalles were determined to come vpon them, or at lea&s;t to build a Ca&s;tle vpon an Ile, hard by <HI>Bantam,</HI> but the Lord hath confounded their de&s;&s;eignes.</P>
<P>Our &s;aide &s;hippes being appointed to make their voy|age to <HI>Banda</HI> and <HI>Terrenata,</HI> for the remainder of the old ac|count,
<PB N="6" REF="4"> furthered their voiage towards the &s;ame Iles, where they found and &s;awe the cruell actions of the Portingalles, as committed by the &s;aide Portingall Fl&eacute;ete in the Ile of <HI>Aubona,</HI> and were departed thence to <HI>Intidor,</HI> where they al&s;o haue a Ca&s;tle. And howbeit the Ile of <HI>Aubona</HI> is &s;citu|ate betw&eacute;ene <HI>Terrenata</HI> and <HI>Banda,</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding our &s;hippes &s;eperated them&s;elues, the better to furni&s;h their la|ding, whereof two directed their cour&s;e for <HI>Banda,</HI> and thr&eacute;e for <HI>Terreneta,</HI> where they found our Factor or Commi&s;&s;io|ner <HI>Francis &V;erdoes</HI> in good health, being in great fauour with the King there, who &s;hewed him all curte&s;ie and kind|ne&s;&s;e, but he had not any great &s;tore of Cloues, by rea&s;on that the yeare had bene verie vn&s;ea&s;onable and vnfruitfull, and y&eacute;elded but &s;mall increa&s;e, as the like had not bene &s;&eacute;ene in many yeares before. They laded &s;uch &s;mal &s;tore of cloues as they found there, and &s;ayled with the thr&eacute;e &s;hippes from thence towards <HI>Banda,</HI> to the other two, where they al&s;o found our Factor or Commi&s;&s;ioner <HI>Adriaen &V;een,</HI> in good health, where one of the two &s;hippes was alreadie fully la|den with Nutmegges and Maces, al&s;o they laded there the &s;hip called <HI>Guelderland,</HI> (which had bene in <HI>Terrenata</HI>) and the &s;mall Pinnace the <HI>Doue,</HI> with which thr&eacute;e &s;hippes the Admirall <HI>Wollfert Hermans</HI> is now comming home. The Pinnace (being a little on the other &s;ide of <HI>Capo de buona Speranza</HI>) &s;traied, hauing lo&s;t the company of the other two &s;hippes, the <HI>Guelderland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> which we al&s;o daily do expect: They &s;ayled with the&s;e thr&eacute;e &s;hips from <HI>Bantam,</HI> on the 25. day of Augu&s;t. The other two &s;hips, <HI>&V;trecht</HI> and the <HI>Wach&s;ter,</HI> vnder the commaund of the Viceadmirall <HI>Hans Bauwell,</HI> &s;ayled from <HI>Bantam</HI> towards <HI>Terrenata,</HI> to the ende to &s;taie there for the new increa&s;e of cloues, mea|ning therewith to lade the &s;aid &s;hippes.</P>
<P><HI>Iacob van Neck,</HI> with his two &s;hips, to w&eacute;ete the <HI>Am|&s;terdam,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="4"> and <HI>Der Goude,</HI> who we thought &s;hould haue had their lading of Cloues in <HI>Terrenata,</HI> and had bin there long before the other &s;hips, hath effected nothing, by rea&s;on of the great &s;carcitie of commodities. And whereas right ouer a|gain&s;t, or hard by the Ca&s;tle <HI>Tydoro,</HI> there laie two Portin|galles &s;hips, and one <HI>Magelane</HI> &s;hip called the <HI>Fayth,</HI> which they had taken before, the &s;aid <HI>&V;an Neck</HI> purpo&s;ed to driue the &s;aide two Portingall &s;hips from thence (I thinke at the reque&s;t and in&s;tance of the King of <HI>Terrenata,</HI>) but his en|terpri&s;e &s;ucc&eacute;eded not very well, for he lo&s;t 8. or 9. of his men, whereof <HI>Nicholas Corneli&s;on</HI> Mai&s;ter of the &s;hip <HI>Ter Goude,</HI> was one, and he him&s;elfe lo&s;t thr&eacute;e of his fingers of his right hand: he &s;ayled from thence towards a place called <HI>Patana,</HI> &s;cituate after <HI>Cuda</HI> or <HI>Malaua,</HI> where he procured halfe la|ding for one of his &s;hips with Pepper, and was purpo&s;ed to returne to <HI>Terrenata,</HI> or at lea&s;twi&s;e &s;end thither the &s;hippe <HI>Ter Goude,</HI> to the ende to lade her with the great encrea&s;e of the new Cloues.</P>
<P>The Admirall <HI>Iacob Van Heemskercke,</HI> who likewi&s;e &s;ayled out of the&s;e Countries on the 23. of Aprill, 1601. is arriued at <HI>Bantam</HI> with &s;ixe &s;hips, and the &s;euenth (being the Viceadmirall, loo&s;ing the company of the other &s;hips about the lyne) hath bene in <HI>Achein,</HI> and hath laden there &s;ome &s;mall &s;tore of Pepper, wherewith he &s;ayled towards <HI>Ban|tam,</HI> where he found his company of the&s;e &s;euen &s;hips, (fiue being fully laden) departed from <HI>Bantam</HI> homewardes, the 11. of May, in the yeare 1602. which was long before the&s;e thr&eacute;e came thence, they mu&s;t be as we thinke in the Ile of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> becau&s;e they would not willingly fall vpon tho&s;e coa&s;tes in the winter &s;ea&s;on: the Lorde graunt them a pro&s;|perous voyage and &s;afe arriuall.</P>
<P>The Admirall <HI>Iacob Van Heemskerke,</HI> is &s;ayled further off with the two other &s;hips towards the Iles, to the end to &s;&eacute;eke out Negotiation.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>Of the two &s;hippes which went towards <HI>China,</HI> there is no newes, but only that at <HI>Bantam</HI> was a &s;p&eacute;ech which is not good: to wit, That tho&s;e of <HI>China</HI> &s;hould haue hanged 15. or 16. of our people which went there a &s;hoare, but thereof is &s;mall certaintie, we hope that the matter &s;hall not be &s;o badde.</P>
<P>Of the &s;hippes of <HI>Zealand</HI> is no certaintie, but only that there was a flying &s;p&eacute;ech of two &s;hippes which were &s;&eacute;ene in the Iles, and therefore it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the two &s;hippes of <HI>Zealand</HI> were there.</P>
<P>Of the Engli&s;h and French &s;hippes we haue no newes at all.</P>
<P>The fiue &s;hippes which &s;ayled and departed from <HI>Bantam</HI> towards the&s;e countries, on the 11. of May, 1602. are the&s;e following. <HI>Am&s;terdam, Horne, Enckhuy&s;en,</HI> the blacke <HI>Lyon,</HI> the gr&eacute;ene <HI>Lyon.</HI></P>
