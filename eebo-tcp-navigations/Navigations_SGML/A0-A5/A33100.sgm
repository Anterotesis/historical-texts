<P>The Honourable Court of Directors, by their Applications to the la&s;t General A&s;&s;embly, and to us, have been careful to repre&s;ent your De&s;ires to have moe Mini&s;ters &s;ent you, and very forward in contri|buting what was proper for them, to accompli&s;h the &s;ame: And we hope we may &s;ay, it hath been the good Hand of God in an&s;wering their Endeavours, and ours, that we herewith &s;end you Four of our Brethren, Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and our Fellow-Work|ers unto the Kingdom of God; Men who have a great Zeal for you, and have very cheerfully hazarded their Lives, in addicting them|&s;elves unto this Mini&s;try, whom we be&s;eech you to receive, and &s;ub|mit your &s;elves unto in the Lord: Tho' we might u&s;e much boldne&s;s in Chri&s;t with you, as our Spiritual Children, in Recommending them as our Brethren; yet it is under an higher and more augu&s;t Cha|racter they come unto you, and under which you are to receive them, as the Servants of the Living God, as the Emba&s;&s;adours of Chri&s;t, as Men ready to &s;pend and be &s;pent in the Service of your Faith and Joy, and in communicating this Go&s;pel to the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in the Regions beyond you:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 The&s;&s;. 5.12.13.</NOTE> Do you therefore <HI>Esteem them very highly in Love for their Works &s;ake,</HI> entertain their Me&s;&s;age, encourage their Endeavours, and &s;trengthen their Hands: We tru&s;t they &s;hall, through Grace, make full Proof of their Mini&s;try among you;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 10.6.

<P>Remember then in the fir&s;t Place, That God is the Soveraign Lord, and ab&s;olute Proprietor of all the Earth; it's He who hath appointed a Place for you, and carried you &s;afely to it. He it is, even the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who fights your Battles again&s;t tho&s;e who would di&s;turb your Settlement: From Him you derive your Original Right and your Security; acknowledge Him then as your Great <HI>Land-Lord</HI> with Sincere and Upright Souls: All you enjoy is His, all you expect is from Him; Pay therefore unto Him due Homage for all: Serve Him who is your God, and the God of your Fathers, and the God of this Nation to which you belong; and cleave to Him with upright Hearts; <HI>For the Lord is with you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Chron. 15.2.</NOTE> <HI>while ye be with Him; and if ye &s;eek Him, He will be &s;ound of you; but if ye for&s;ake Him, He will for&s;ake you.</HI></P>
<P>You are not left like the blind <HI>Heathen</HI> to grope after Him, as in the Dark;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 17.27.</NOTE> He hath been, and Is nigh unto you, and your Eyes have
<PB N="5" REF="4"> been opened (even all of you, at lea&s;t, by Chri&s;tian Education) to behold him, not only in his wondrous Works, which all Men behold; but in the mo&s;t wonderful of all his Works, in his Glorious Go&s;pel: By this you have been taught that <HI>God is a Spirit,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 4.24. Deut. 12.4, 31.</NOTE> and you mu&s;t <HI>Wor|&s;hip him in Spirit and in Truth: You &s;hall not do &s;o unto the Lord your God,</HI> as the <HI>Heathen</HI> do unto their Gods, who &s;tupidly, and blocki&s;hly Wor|&s;hip their blocki&s;h Idols;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Kings 17.26.27.</NOTE> but you mu&s;t remember <HI>the Manner of the God of the Land</HI> from whence you came, and &s;erve him after his own Manner revealed in his Go&s;pel. There you have been in&s;tructed that in all Places his Eye is upon you, and he ob&s;erves your Hearts and Ways in <HI>Caledonia</HI> no le&s;s than in <HI>Scotland:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 139.9.</NOTE> <HI>The Wings of the Morn|ing, and the uttermo&s;t Parts of the Sea</HI> hide not from him: All are his Territories and under his Dominion: 'Tis there you Learn that in <HI>every Nation</HI> and in every Place, <HI>he that feareth God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts. 10.35. 1 Tim. 2.8.</NOTE> <HI>and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> that <HI>lifteth up holy Hands without Wrath, or Doubting,</HI> is accepted of him; but that the Workers of Iniquity can no where e|&s;cape his Notice, nor get out of the Reach of his Ju&s;tice, but by Fly|ing in to Chri&s;t, and taking Refuge in that ble&s;&s;ed Hope which the Go&s;pel &s;ets before them.</P>
<P>We be&s;eech you to Ponder the&s;e Things with all due Seriou&s;ne&s;s; Let them be ever pre&s;ent to your Minds, with a Practical Influence, and Operation upon your Spirits, and your whole Deportment; that you Reverence, and Serve, Tru&s;t and Adore, Love and Obey that God who&s;e you are, and who&s;e are all your Wayes: To him you owe your pre&s;ent Settlement, and your future Hopes; See and enjoy his Bounty and Kindne&s;s in all: Labour to know and di&s;cern, upon Go&s;pel-Evidence, that he be&s;toweth outward Ble&s;&s;ings upon you from his Love in Chri&s;t: This will make <HI>your Caledonia</HI> to be a Land of Promi&s;e, and a Pledge of that better Inheritance re&s;erved in Heaven for you, where all the Gold and Riches of the Earth, the Things mo&s;t Valued by Men, heap'd together, do make but a faint Metaphor for the Pavement of that mo&s;t Glorious City: And after all the Ac|qui&s;itions of this World, what is a Man Profited if he lo&s;e his own Soul?</P>
<P>Let &s;uch as are yet Strangers to Chri&s;t, repent of all their Sins com|mitted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or &s;ince their Arrival in their New Dwellings, and con&s;ider with A&s;toni&s;hment, with Gratitude, with relenring Sor|row and Shame, how many hundreds of Leagues they have been car|ried fafe, through the Va&s;t Aby&s;s, when there was but the thickne&s;s of a Plank between them and Death, and con&s;equently between them and Hell; How near they have bordered upon the confines of Eternity;
<PB N="6" REF="5"> and how dreadful it will be at la&s;t, if the Waves and Billows of Di|vine Wrath &s;hall go over their Souls for ever. This is the Doom that every Sinner mu&s;t undergo by him&s;elf, if it be not taken off by his Surety; and &s;uch as Fly not to the Go&s;pel-Sanctuary, and Refuge, their Sin will &s;urely find them out, wherever they go.</P>
<P>We do mo&s;t earne&s;tly Intreat and Obte&s;t you the Honourable and Worthy Per&s;ons in who&s;e Hands the Government is Lodged, that you not only be &s;hining Paterns your Selves, in all Sobriety, Holine&s;s and Vertue; But that, with the outmo&s;t Diligence, and vigilant Care, you procure, that the Deportment and Behaviour of all under your Authority and Influence, be &s;uch as becometh the Go&s;pel; by Com|manding every one to do their Duty, by enacting &s;trick and whole|&s;om Laws, and Executing tho&s;e Laws impartially, and &s;peedily; That no Wickedne&s;s be Countenanced, or in the lea&s;t connived at; For why &s;hould you bring Wrath upon your &s;elves, and the Land, and provoke the holy God to bla&s;t all your Undertakings? And why &s;hould you Forfeit his Ble&s;&s;ing and Favour promi&s;ed to Righteous Ru|lers, and make your Selves Partakers of other Mens Sins? For what|ever is committed thro' your Forbearance, and Remi&s;ne&s;s in Govern|ment, is ju&s;tly Chargable on you: Every Man is Guilty of that Sin which he Reproves not, which he does not Te&s;tifie again&s;t, which he can, but neglects to hinder in another; But mo&s;t of all, &s;uch as are Rulers of others, and mu&s;t give an Account of them to God, as well as of them&s;elves.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. 19.17.</NOTE> <HI>Thou &s;halt not hate thy Brother in thy Heart, thou &s;halt in any ways rebuke thy Neighbour, and not &s;uffer Sin upon him:</HI> And in the Margin it reads, <HI>That thou bear not Sin for him:</HI> This is a Law given unto all; But the peculiar End of Magi&s;tracy is, to be a Terror unto Evil-doers, and for the Prai&s;e of them that do Well; To &s;et their Eyes of Favour upon the Faithful of the Land; and to cut off all Wicked-doers from the City of the Lord.</P>
<P>There is yet a &s;pecial Obligation upon you, in the Planting and Erecting of a New Colony, to take Care that Religion and Vertue be planted and thrive in it.

<P>We be&s;eech you, for the Lord's Sake, for your own Souls Sake, and for the Sake of your Country, and of your Po&s;terity, for all that is, and ought to be Sacred, and Dear to Chri&s;tians, or to Men, that you with&s;tand, and prevent the corrupting of <HI>your Infant Colony,</HI> that you Oppo&s;e and Stop the fir&s;t Appearances or Occa&s;ions of Vice a|mong&s;t your People; and keep them clo&s;e to the &s;trict Rules of Chri|&s;tian Morality, and a Go&s;pel adorning Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Can any think but the Divine Maje&s;ty will re&s;ent, and Avenge the Helli&s;h, Unnatural, and Uncreaturly Prophanation of his Dreadful and Holy Name, (a Sin void of Tentation, and full of Horrour) or that ever the <HI>Heathen</HI> will be induced to Adore that God, whom his own Wor&s;hippers Trample upon, and Contemn by prophane Swear|ing? And, whereas Oaths, among&s;t all Nations, are, and ought to be e&s;teem'd mo&s;t Sacred, and binding; What Veneration or Credit will they give to the Oaths of tho&s;e, who Pro&s;titute them, tho' it were

<P>Let not only all Fal&s;hood in Words and Actions be &s;everely puni&s;h|ed, as what is incon&s;i&s;tent with Humane Society, and Enervats and De&s;troys Trade; (Faith, and uprightne&s;s in Dealing, being the Life and Soul of Commerce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 10.9.</NOTE> and the be&s;t Foundation of Succe&s;s, <HI>for he that walketh uprightly walketh &s;urely</HI>) But likewi&s;e Di&s;courage and Di&s;grace Self-&s;eeking, and Narrowne&s;s, to the prejudice of the Publick: Let not every one &s;eek his own Things, to the Detriment of his Neigh|bour, but every one the Good of others, and common Benefit; for

E&s;peci|ally this is to be look'd to, in the beginning of a Settlement, and In|fancy of a Government; where Publick Spiritedne&s;s and Self-denial, as they are Go&s;pel-precepts, &s;o, will be found be&s;t Principles of Poli|cy; whereas Self-&s;eeking hath ever been the Bane and Ruine of ma|ny promi&s;ing Undertakings.</P>
<P>We cannot forget to Recommend to you Brotherly-Love and Con|cord, and that you Live in Peace and Unity among your Selves; a Thing no le&s;s Profitable to you, than Plea&s;ant to the God of Peace, and &s;uitable to the Chri&s;tian Name: This is our Lord's New Com|mandment left by Him in Legacy to all his Followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joh. 13.34, 35.</NOTE> that they <HI>Love one another:</HI> By this ev'n the <HI>Heathen</HI>-Nations &s;hall know that you are the Di&s;ciples of the Prince of Peace. We need not tell you what is the Common-remark on the&s;e of our Nation, that, however Ha&s;ty, Impatient, and Warm they may be in their Debates, while at Home; yet they are Noted as Exemplary to others, in an affectionat Concern in, Sympathy with, and clo&s;e Adherence to one another, when Abroad. We heartily Wi&s;h this may be Verified of you, now when you are far removed from your Native Land, and plac'd amid&s;t envious Neigh|bours, who are waiting for your Halting, and would make it their Work to Improve, to your Hurt, any Difference that might ari&s;e a|mong you.</P>
<P>Let righteous Judgement be Executed betwixt Man and Man; for the Judgement is the Lords. Let it be done Impartially, without vexa|tious Quibbles or dilatory Forms, and Di&s;pen&s;ed either <HI>Gratis,</HI> or u|pon a publick Salary; &s;o as no Magi&s;trat may Gain by Fynes of his own Impo&s;ing; a Practice mo&s;t hurtful in your Native Land; where|by the Covetous are Tempted to Squeeze and Oppre&s;s, and tho&s;e of a more hone&s;t and free Di&s;po&s;ition, to become over Slack, left they &s;hould appear gripping for their own Intere&s;t. And in general, what|ever <HI>Scripture</HI> or <HI>&s;olid Rea&s;on</HI> hath Di&s;covered to you to be Wrong, or of ill Con&s;equence, in the Cu&s;toms you have &s;een at Home or el&s;e where, and in the Errors of other Plantations, let the&s;e Things be carefully Avoided in your New Government.</P>
<P>The Eyes of God, of Angels and of Men are upon you; The World begins to take Notice of you, as a mo&s;t hopeful <HI>Colony,</HI> to the En|vy of your Enemies, and the Joy of your own Country and Friends. Remember, as you are a People of great Expectation, and of great Advantages; So your Honour and Renown, your Temporal, as well as your Spiritual and Eternal Gain &s;hall be Great, if you improve your
<PB N="10" REF="7"> Talent, and Manage the Price put in your Hands, Wi&s;ely and Well; but if otherwi&s;e, your Reckoning mu&s;t be Sore and Heavy, and your End Inglorious.</P>
<P>We again Repeat our mo&s;t earne&s;t Intreaties unto you, our Dear and Honoured Friends, that you be very Exact, Vigilant, and Con&s;cientious in Modeling your New <HI>Colony</HI> to all Vertue, and Godline&s;s; E&s;pecially in the fir&s;t Beginning; which is of va&s;t Im|portance in all great Undertakings; And a due Care of which will render all after Proceedings Ea&s;&s;e, Plea&s;ant, and Succesful; That you bend your outmo&s;t Endeavours, both by Example and Law, to make Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Sobriety, and Godline&s;s appear in the Eyes of others, as they are in them&s;elves, Amiable and Honourable; And all Vice and Impiety, Dete&s;table and Infamous; So as a vitious Per&s;on may look like a Mon&s;ter, and Object of Horrour among&s;t you: Thus, Religion and Vertue will Incorporat into your very Cu&s;toms and Con|&s;titutions, and your Laws and Per&s;ons will be Venerable, without the grievous Nece&s;&s;ity of being Severe; and God will Ble&s;s you, and De|light to Dwell among you;<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. 62.4. Ezek. 43.</NOTE> and your Land <HI>&s;hall be called Hephzi-bah,</HI> and the Name of your Place <HI>Jehovah-&s;hammah, the Lord is there.</HI> But if any will do Wickedly, if Men will be Fooli&s;h and Froward, your Duty to God, and Mercy to the Community, calls for Speedy and Exemplary Ju&s;tice, that you may put the Evil away from among you, and that Others may Hear and Fear.</P>
<P>As we Recommend unto you a Ju&s;t and Chri&s;tian Regard to all Go&s;|pel-Ordinances; So in Particular, a Religious Ob&s;ervance and Sancti|fication of the Lord's Day, the Neglect of which will ly heavy on Governours, the Command being peculiarly giv'n to them, as Per&s;ons that mu&s;t An&s;wer for their Children and Servants, and for the Stran|ger that is within their Gates, as well as for Them&s;elves: If the Sab|bath of the Lord be Prophan'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lev. 26.43.</NOTE> He will cau&s;e your Land <HI>to Enjoy its Sabbaths,</HI> by De&s;olation. But if you Sanctifie the Holy Day of Re&s;t unto the Lord, he will Procure and Maintain Re&s;t for you in your Land.</P>
<P>And as we are hopeful of your Ju&s;t and Faithful Dealings with all Men, whom you may have Occa&s;ion to Negotiat, and Trade with; So we Recommend, not only Equity and Ju&s;tice, but, obliging Kind|ne&s;s towards the <HI>Natives;</HI> That your People may not only have their Conver&s;ation Hone&s;t among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but winning and engaging, by Beneficence; That they, Beholding and Enjoying the Benefit of your Good-Works, may Glorifie God in the Day of your Vi&s;itation. If you Partake of their Temporal Things, are you not bound to Mini|&s;ter unto Them of your Spiritual Things? Verily, their Debtors you
<PB N="11" REF="7"> are; And not only is it the Intere&s;t of your Trade, and your Safe|ty, to keep good Mea&s;ures with them; but 'tis your po&s;itive Duty, for which the Lord &s;eems in a peculiar Manner to have De&s;igned <HI>your Plantation,</HI> as its mo&s;t glorious End; To Propagat the Light of his Go&s;pel among&s;t them, and that Heavenly Wi&s;dom which is more Precious than all Riches, and who&s;e Merchandi&s;e is better than the Gold of <HI>Ophir</HI> or <HI>Darien:</HI> 'Tis by their Con&s;ent that God Confirms your Right, therefore Cheri&s;h them, as your Brethren, of the &s;ame Blood, and Kindred in <HI>Adam;</HI> And Endeavour that you may have them al&s;o your Brethren in Chri&s;t; not only, let no Stumbling-block, or Occa&s;ion of Offence, be laid before them, but all due Encourage|ment giv'n them, to Embrace the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel. Let them &s;ee what Veneration, and Regard you Pay to your Mini&s;ters, as the Servants of the mo&s;t High God, who mu&s;t Labour among&s;t them; and to the Ordinances of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as the Common Means of your and their Salvation.</P>
<P>It will be needful you Study their Genius Well: For &s;ome of the&s;e Nations are Naturally more Sincere, and Simple; Others more Sub|tile, and Treacherous; But, Generally, all of them, E&s;pecially in the Beginning, Su&s;picious and Jealous, Credulous, and Apt to take Ill Im|pre&s;&s;ions, and not Ea&s;ie to Quit them; Al&s;o mo&s;t Revengful, and Cruel, where they can be Ma&s;ters, upon the Apprehen&s;ion of the lea&s;t Injury done them, to which they have got too many Irritations, by other <HI>Europeans,</HI> who have come among them. Therefore, there's need, you be, in the mid&s;t of them, Wi&s;e as Serpents, and Harmle&s;s as Doves: You are always to be very Watchful, and upon your Guard, that you may prevent Surprizals, and be able to Defend your Selves, if they &s;hould take up any Prejudice, and Irritation, Groundle&s;ly, a|gain&s;t you: Be very Concerned to See that none of Yours Injure, or Di&s;oblige Them in the lea&s;t, without Due and Speedy Puni&s;hment, and that more &s;everely Inflicted, than for the&s;e Injuries done by any of you again&s;t another of your Selves. And, be&s;ide the Puni&s;hment you may find Ju&s;t, and Nece&s;&s;ar to Inflict, be &s;ure any Dammage they Su&s;tain be Repay'd, tho' it &s;hould be done by the Publick, when the Offending-Party is not able. By any Means, by continual Conver&s;e, endeavour to Civilize them, and cultivat any Principles of Natural Under&s;tanding, and Rea&s;on, they have, which will indeed require great Prudence, and Dexterity in the Manage|ment: And when they &s;ee Piety, Sincerity and Equity Flouri&s;hing a|mong You; it will be the mo&s;t Effectual, and endearing Tye to Knit them to your Intere&s;t.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P>Be careful in doing Ju&s;tice betwixt Ma&s;ters and Servants: Let their Service be a rea&s;onable Service, and Time allow'd them for their Publick and Privat Wor&s;hipping of God, for they are your Brethren: And when their Time Expires; let them meet with &s;uch Encouragement, as may always Engage them to continue, and Settle among you: where|by, from time to time, you will be Strength'ned, and Increa&s;ed, and O|thers Encouraged to come unto You.</P>
<P>If You &s;hall have Servants for Life, or Slaves, of other Nations; (for the <HI>Natives</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> we con&s;ider as your Confederats and <HI>Allies</HI>) as we Wi&s;h you to be Tender, both of their Souls and Bo|dies, and to Encourage their Conver&s;ion to <HI>Christianity,</HI> by all proper Means; So we do not Urge that their ab&s;olute Liberty, and Freedom from their Service, &s;hould, as in &s;ome other Places, be made the im|mediat Reward of their Profe&s;&s;ing to Receive the Go&s;pel: For this hath tempted Ma&s;ters to withhold them from the Means of their Con|ver&s;ion, le&s;t they &s;hould be Indammaged by the Lo&s;e of their Service; and hath occa&s;ion'd the Slaves to make Counterfeit Profe&s;&s;ions, to gain their Liberty. But we Recommend a Gentle-Rule, a Mild Treat|ment, and that full Acce&s;s and Time be Allow'd for their Chri&s;tian In&s;tru|ction, and let &s;uch Rules be agreed on, as that the&s;e at lea&s;t of them, who &s;hal, not only Profe&s;s the <HI>Chri&s;tian-Religion,</HI> but have &s;uch a Go&s;pel-Adorn|ing Conver&s;ation, as may Recommend them to the Con&s;ciences of the Godly, as Chri&s;tians indeed, may have their full Freedom by &s;uch Means, and upon &s;uch Terms, as may be Safe and Advantagious, both to their Ma&s;ters and Them. Immortal Souls are of great Value, and the Ble&s;|&s;ings of The&s;e, who are ready to Peri&s;h, are not to be De&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>We &s;hall, in the next Place, particularly Addre&s;s our Selves to You, that are in Military-Charge, and have Command over the Souldiery, whether by Land or Sea: It's on you, <HI>Honoured and Worthy Gentle|men,</HI> that a great Share of the Burden of the Publick Safety lyes; you are, in &s;ome Re&s;pect, both the Eyes, and Hands of this Infant <HI>Colony:</HI> Many of you have been lately Engaged in a Ju&s;t and Glorious War, for Retriving, and Defending the <HI>Prote&s;tant-Religion,</HI> the Liber|ties, and Rights of your Country, under the Conduct of a <HI>Matchle&s;s Prince,</HI> And now, when thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord of <HI>Ho&s;ts,</HI> His and Your Arms have procured an Honourable Peace at Home; You, and others with you, have, with much Bravery, embark'd your Selves in a Great, Generous, and Ju&s;t Undertaking, in the Remote Parts of the Earth, for Advancing the Honour and Intere&s;t of your Native-Country: If in this you acquit your Selves like Men, and <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> Your Fame will be Renown'd both Abroad and at Home.
