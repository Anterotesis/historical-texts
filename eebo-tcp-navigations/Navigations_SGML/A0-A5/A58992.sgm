For, there were founded, anciently, in the Church of St. <HI>Pauls,</HI> two Cardinals cho&s;en by Dean and Chapter, out of the twelve petty Cannons, who&s;e Office was to look to tho&s;e of the Quire, to give the Euchari&s;t, to the Mini&s;ter of that Church and his Servants, to hear Confe&s;&s;ions, appoint Penance, and to commit the Dead to convenient Sepulture, and two of them lie buried in the Church of St. <HI>Faiths.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="9">This Cu&s;tom of Cardinal-making was in many other Countries, but afterwards, was appropriated to <HI>Rome,</HI> where they are divided into Bi&s;hops, who are A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with the Popes Prie&s;ts, who are A&s;&s;i&s;t|ants, and Deacons, <HI>Qui &s;erviunt Servo Servorum Dei,</HI> who are Attendants on his Holine&s;s.

<P>Pope <HI>Paul</HI> II. made it Penal, for any beneath their Order, in <HI>Rome,</HI> to wear a <HI>Red hat.</HI> The Cardinal-Bi&s;hops took place of the Emperour before his Co|ronation, and of other Kings. The Popes were to be cho&s;en by, and out of that Order. The Cardinal-Deacons were oftentimes elected to the Popedom before the Cardinal-Prie&s;ts. There is at this day, a Brother of the late Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI> enjoys the Title and Dignity of Cardinal.

<P>Sometimes the place of one's birth is rendred uncertain, when &s;everal places have the &s;ame name. One in&s;tance of many, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham</HI> was the famous Founder of <HI>New Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford</HI>: But how can his Cradle be certainly fixed in any place, when it is equally rock't betwixt <HI>twenty</HI> Villages of the &s;ame Denomination? In inquiries of this Nature and Difficulty, 'tis be&s;t to have recour&s;e to the Cir|cum&s;tances in the Hi&s;tory of &s;uch a controverted Per&s;on. Where two or more places claim the birth of the &s;ame Per&s;on, my u&s;ual expedient is to in&s;ert the Character at large, of the controverted Per&s;on in that County, which produceth the be&s;t Evidence for him, yet &s;o, that I al&s;o enter his name with a reference in the other re&s;pective places, which with probability pretend unto him. But many multiply differences in the places of Mens birth by mi&s;take. The Papi&s;ts can tell you a Tale how the Men of <HI>two</HI> Towns in <HI>Germany</HI> fell out and fought together, whil&s;t one of them was for <HI>Martin,</HI> the other for <HI>Luther,</HI> being but the &s;everal Names of the &s;ame Per&s;on. If one Author affirms Bi&s;hop <HI>Jewel</HI> born at <HI>Buden,</HI> another at <HI>Berinerber,</HI> let none make &s;trife betwixt the&s;e two Writers, the former naming the Hou&s;e and Village, the later the Pari&s;h wherein he was born.</P>
<P>As for the Sons of Mini&s;ters, tho &s;ome unchari|tably think them <HI>generally unfortunate,</HI> by the &s;equel of this Treati&s;e it will plainly appear that they have by <HI>Gods</HI> Ble&s;&s;ing, proved as eminent as any who have rai&s;ed them&s;elves by their own endeavours. For State&s;men, <HI>George Carew,</HI> Privy Councellor of
<PB N="22" REF="18">
<HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and as able a Man, as the Age he lived in, produced, was <HI>Earl</HI> of <HI>Totnes,</HI> the &s;ame place whereof his Father was Arch-Deacon. Sir <HI>Edwin Sandys,</HI> Son to Arch-B&s;hiop <HI>Sandys,</HI> was a Man of &s;uch Merit, that <HI>England</HI> could not afford an Office which he could not manage. For Lawyers, Sir <HI>Th.

For Seamen, Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> that great <HI>Scourge</HI> and <HI>Terrour</HI> to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pride. But the Sons of Mini&s;ters have never been more Succe&s;sfull, then when bred in the Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of their Fathers.

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIV. Of a Two-fold Engli&s;h Gentry, <HI>viz.</HI> by Nation and Profe&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>I Begin with the Ancient <HI>Britains</HI> who Inhabited the <HI>South,</HI> and were &s;ucceeded by the <HI>Saxons</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t.</HI> As for the more Ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> their De&s;cendants are not by any Character di&s;cernable from the <HI>Briti&s;h.</HI> The Off-&s;pring of the <HI>Saxons</HI> are the main <HI>bulk</HI> and body, not of the Gentry but of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. The&s;e, tho pitifully di&s;per&s;ed by the Conqueror, yet by <HI>God's Goodne&s;s,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> I. his <HI>favour,</HI> their own <HI>patience</HI> and <HI>diligence,</HI> put together the Planks of their Ship-wrackt E&s;tates and afterwards recovered a Competent condition. The <HI>Danes</HI> were rather <HI>Inroders</HI> here then Inhabitants, of who&s;e Extraction there are therefore few in our Age, among whom the <HI>Denizes</HI> (often Sheriffs in <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Gloce&s;ter&s;hire</HI>) appear the principal. As for <HI>Fitz-Harding,</HI> the younger Son of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Denmark,</HI> and direct Ance&s;tor of the truly Honou|rable <HI>George</HI> Lord <HI>Berkley,</HI> he came long &s;ince, when he accompanied the Conquerour. They &s;eem to err who are of Opinion, that tho&s;e Names which end in <HI>&s;on,</HI> as <HI>John&s;on, Thom&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. are of <HI>Da|ni&s;h</HI> Origination, &s;ince the <HI>Danes</HI> had no &s;uch Names in u&s;e among them as <HI>John</HI> or <HI>Thomas, &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>Normans,</HI> after the Conque&s;t became the only <HI>vi&s;ible Gentry</HI> of this Nation, and &s;till continue more then a moiety thereof. There are &s;ome Surnames of the good Families in <HI>England</HI> now extant, which tho

<P>As for the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> of any Eminency, their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Inclination</HI> have drawn them to other Countries rather then <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>Italian</HI> Nation, very few have founded Fa|milies in <HI>England,</HI> yet have we a Sprinkling of <HI>Ita|lian Prote&s;tants, Ca&s;tilian,</HI> a Valiant Gentleman of <HI>Bark&s;hire,</HI> the <HI>Ba&s;&s;anoes,</HI> Excellent Painters and Mu|&s;icians

<P>The <HI>High dutch</HI> of the <HI>Hans</HI> Towns, anciently much conver&s;ed in our Land, known by the Name of <HI>Ea|&s;terlings,</HI> invited hither by the large Priviledges our Kings conferred upon them, &s;o that the <HI>Steel-Yard</HI> was the <HI>Gold-yard</HI> unto them; But the&s;e Merchants moved round in their own <HI>Sphere,</HI> matching among them&s;elves, without mingling with our Nation. Only we may pre&s;ume that the <HI>Ea&s;terlings,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Stradlings,</HI> formerly Sheriffs in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and &s;till fa|mous in <HI>Glamorgan&s;hire,</HI> with the <HI>Ne&s;tphalings,</HI> late|ly Sheriffs of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> were originally of <HI>German</HI> Extraction.</P>
<P>The <HI>Low Countrey-men</HI> frighted by Duke of <HI>Alva</HI>'s <HI>long-No&s;e</HI> and longer Sword, flocked hither, under King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. fixing them&s;elves in <HI>London, Norwich, Canterbury</HI> and <HI>Sandwich.</HI> But the&s;e con|fined them&s;elves to their own Church-di&s;cipline, and advanced not forward by <HI>Eminent Matches</HI> into our Nation. Yet I behold the worthy Family of <HI>de la Fountain</HI> in <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> as of <HI>Belgian</HI> original, and have read how the Ance&s;tors of Sir <HI>Simond D'us</HI> in <HI>Suffolk,</HI> came hither under King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. from the <HI>Duna&s;ti</HI> or <HI>D'us</HI> in <HI>Gelderland.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> tho their King <HI>Philip</HI> match|ed with our Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> yet few of any Eminence now extant (if I well remember) derive their Pe|digrees from them; by rea&s;on of their &s;hort Reign and the en&s;uing Change of Religions. Probable it is we might have had more Natives of that Kingdom to have &s;etled and flouri&s;hed in our Nation, had he

obtained a Marriage with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as he de|&s;ired.</P>
<P>Of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> few have fixed their Habitations here, yet is the want of the Number of the&s;e abun|dantly &s;upplyed with the Tran&s;cendent Quality and mo&s;t Noble Vertues of our gracious Queen, who as <HI>Cynthia,</HI> di&s;pen&s;es her <HI>Royal Influence</HI> to the le&s;&s;er Stars, and Strikes with <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Veneration</HI> the <HI>Hearts</HI> of all.

Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> hath prevented my Pains, and given in a Li&s;t of &s;uch Prin|cipal Families. 'Tis admirable, that there is not a great and Numerous Hou&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> wherein there is not one, Anciently or at this day Living, thriving and flouri&s;hing, by the <HI>Study</HI> of the <HI>Law.</HI> E&s;pecially if to them be added tho&s;e who have rai&s;|ed them&s;elves in Courts of Judicature.</P>
<P>The City hath produced more then the Law in Number, and &s;ome as broad in <HI>Wealth,</HI> but not &s;o high in <HI>Honour</HI> nor long la&s;ting in time, who like

Landfloods, &s;oon come, and &s;oon gone, have been dry|ed up before this Generation. Yet many of the&s;e have continued in a certain Channel, and carried a con&s;tant Stream.</P>
<P>The Church before the <HI>Reformation,</HI> advanced many Families. For tho Bi&s;hops might not marry, they preferred their <HI>Brothers Sons</HI> to great E&s;tates, as the <HI>Kemps</HI> in <HI>Kent, Peckhams</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex, Wickhams</HI> in <HI>Hamp&s;hire, Meltons</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Reformation, &s;ome have rai&s;ed their Families to a Knightly and Wor&s;hipful E&s;tate, as <HI>Hutton, Bil&s;on, Dove, Neil,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>The <HI>Civil Law</HI> hath preferred few. The mo&s;t Eminent in that Faculty before the Reformation be|ing Per&s;ons in Orders ab&s;tained from Marriage; &s;ince the Reformation, there are Wor&s;hipful Families rai&s;ed thereby. The profe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Civil Law</HI> were e|qually Contemned with Gods <HI>Mini&s;ters,</HI> during the Civil Wars, the Promoters whereof having a con|&s;tant Pique at all <HI>Civility</HI> and <HI>Order.</HI> But by the <HI>Return</HI> of our <HI>Britti&s;h Sun,</HI> tho&s;e <HI>Clouds</HI> of <HI>Barbarity</HI> are di&s;pelled, and Regularity of Motion and good <HI>Order</HI> is introduced into the va&s;t <HI>Sphere</HI> of his Domi|nion, and the joyful Sea&s;ons of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Plenty</HI> are by his <HI>kindly Influences</HI> re&s;tored.</P>
<P><HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> hath promoted more, and that &s;ince the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> 8.
