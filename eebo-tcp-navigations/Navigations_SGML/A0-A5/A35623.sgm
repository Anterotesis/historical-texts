<HEAD>THE CASE Of many HUNDREDS OF Poor Engli&s;h-Captives, IN ALGIER, <HI><HI>With &s;ome Remedies</HI> To Prevent their Increa&s;e, Humbly Repre&s;ented to</HI> Both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THat there hath been taken, &s;ince their la&s;t breach with us, not le&s;s than an Hundred and Forty Sail of Ships and other Ve&s;&s;els, many of them being richly laden, be&s;ides the great Advance they make upon the per&s;ons they take, there being at this time upwards of 1500, (be&s;ides many Hundreds who have Dyed there of the Plague,) who &s;uffer and undergo mo&s;t mi&s;erable Slavery, put to dayly extream and difficult Labour, but a poor &s;upply of Bread and Water for their Food, &s;tripped of their Cloaths and covering, and their Lodging on the cold Stones and Bricks; but what is more, their extream hard and &s;avage la|ding them &s;ometimes with great burthens of Chains, and &s;hut up in noi&s;ome places, commonly adding &s;ome hundreds of blows on their bare feet, forcing out the very Blood, and &s;ometimes on the Back, &s;ometimes on the Belly, and &s;ometimes on them all, in&s;omuch that ma|ny are long decripit, &s;ome for ever, and &s;ome dying under their hands. But above all, is their frequent forcing of Men and Boys by their exe|crable <HI>Sodomy,</HI> al&s;o their inhumane abu&s;es and force to the Bodies of Women and Girls, frequently attempting <HI>Sodomy</HI> on them al&s;o, &s;ome of whom both Males and Females have been &s;o abu&s;ed as hardly to e|&s;cape with their Lives; All which U&s;age is &s;o notoriou&s;ly known by tho&s;e who have been redeemed thence, that it needs no proof.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P>ANd <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is apparent that that Promoters of all the inhumane u&s;age of Chri&s;tians, are principally the <HI>Jews</HI> there Inhabiting, there being hardly any one Ve&s;&s;el of tho&s;e cruel Pyrates, but the owners thereof are for a great part <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is apparent al&s;o, that all tho&s;e ill-gotten Ships and Goods which they &s;o barbarou&s;ly Rob and take from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Merchants and Marriners, (to the great Impoveri&s;hing of this Nation) the <HI>Jews</HI> are the con&s;tant Buyers of, and &s;o of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-Captives, there being few Slaves in <HI>Algier,</HI> but a <HI>Iew</HI> is their Patroon, or el&s;e hath at lea&s;t a &s;hare in them.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is further evident that the <HI>Jews</HI> are the chief-In&s;tigators of the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> to make tho&s;e poor Chri&s;tian-Captives to deny their Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and it is they who incourage &s;uch on whom they &s;o prevail to turn Runnagadoes, and prefer them to commands and Office in their Pyratical &s;hips.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That it is the <HI>Jews</HI> who inhaunce the price of Chri&s;tian &s;ouls, by Buying them at &s;mall Rates, and then exacting great &s;umms for their Redem|ption, quite contrary to their u&s;age at the taking of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> when Thirty <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;old for a Groat, and po&s;&s;ibly the Chri&s;tians might now be Re|deemed at much lower Rates, were it not for the <HI>Jews</HI> who buy them, and do now exact a Thou&s;and pound for the Redemption of one Captive, when po&s;&s;i|bly he, nor any of his Relations, are not worth half the value.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That the Jews are tho&s;e who &s;tir up the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> &s;o to beat and abu&s;e poor Captives, they not daring to do it them&s;elves, for fear their Blows &s;hould be returned upon them again; &s;o that the Natives of the place are but meer Va&s;&s;als and Slaves to the Jews, and for the Lucre of their Money do Execute all their Cruel and Bloody De&s;igns and projects both abroad and at home; all which will be abundantly proved by many Witne&s;&s;es, when ever they &s;hall be called thereunto.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> It is much to be feared that the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Algier,</HI> have too great cor|re&s;pondency with and countenance from the <HI>Jews</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> and that by their means it is that they in <HI>Algier</HI> have always Li&s;ts of all our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hips, e&s;pecially of the Fleets coming from any of His Maje&s;ties Plantations abroad, and of the very time they are expected to go out or return, with a perfect Ac|count of the quality and condition of all Merchants and pa&s;&s;engers aboard, if any &s;uch there be, by which means they exact &s;uch great &s;umms as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>And this may further appear when it is con&s;idered how little the Dammage is, as well to <HI>England</HI> as to all other parts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> by <HI>Tripoly</HI> or <HI>Tunis,</HI> when ever they make any breach upon us; the true rea&s;on whereof is, the paucity and poverty of the <HI>Jews</HI> in tho&s;e places: And therefore for a Remedy hereof, It is humbly propo&s;ed to the Con&s;ideration of both Hou&s;es of <HI>Parlia|ment,</HI> one or both of the&s;e Two ways following.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By the De&s;truction of this Town of <HI>Algier</HI> (the <HI>Pe&s;t</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom</HI>) and that with no great Force and Charge may be totally Demoli&s;h|ed, with their Mould and Fortifications, as may be ea&s;ily Demon&s;trated were there but a due Incouragement given to &s;uch as are willing to Un|dertake the &s;ame.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Or to make a Law, That whatever Damage or Lo&s;s the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;hall &s;u&s;tain by means or procurement of the Jews in <HI>Algier</HI> or el&s;ewhere, it &s;hall be required and made good to the Loo&s;ers out of the E&s;tates of the Jews here in <HI>England.</HI> Which is Humbly offered for the&s;e Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e &s;uch a Law may &s;ave a great Expence of Trea&s;ure, and al&s;o of Chri&s;tian Blood, which this Nation hath &s;adly felt, and may Effect that Peace and Tranquility to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traders which hitherto Force hath not done.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Becau&s;e the Jews have here the full Exerci&s;e of their Fal&s;e and pernicious Religion and Wor&s;hip, whil&s;t thou&s;ands of poor <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Chri&s;tians differing in no point from the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are daily hara&s;ed and undone, to the great joy and Laughter of the Jews, &s;ee|ing Chri&s;tians thus tear and mole&s;t one another, whil&s;t them&s;elves are pro|jecting to de&s;troy us all abroad, and eating up the Trade of our Engli&s;h Mer|chants at home.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Charity of this Nation may be Imployed on other Good Occa&s;ions, which is now Collected for the Redemption of CAPTIVES, for that it is rather an Incouragement to tho&s;e JEWS of <HI>Algier</HI> Vigorou&s;ly to proceed in their Rapines and Robberies, when they &s;hall &s;ee the Charity of a whole Nation made U&s;e of to rai&s;e Money for the &s;atisfying their Inhumane Exactions on poor Chri&s;tians, and may be ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;ed rather to rai&s;e the Price of their Redemption, then to Le&s;&s;en it.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> It is but <HI>Jus gentium</HI> when a Nation &s;uffers by one &s;ort of Peo|ple, That Reparation and Satisfaction be required of any others of that &s;ort of People wherever they may be found in our Power, for on this Principle onely is grounded all Letters of Mart and Repri&s;al granted by Kings and States. Moreover, it is verily believed, That the JEWS in all places are in a Combination and Society whereby they have Influence on the Proceed|ings of all JEWS in what place &s;oever, and &s;hares in their Profit and Lo&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The very Terror of &s;uch a Law would Ingage tho&s;e Jews in other more Hone&s;t Cour&s;es than this of Inriching them&s;elves by the Ruine and De&s;truction of poor Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> If this or &s;ome other Cour&s;e be not Effectually taken, tho&s;e Jews of <HI>Algier</HI> will by their Robberies and Spoil &s;o Inrich them&s;elves, as to be able to &s;et forth &s;uch Fleets as &s;hall Match or Cope with any of our Kings of <HI>Chri&s;tendom;</HI> witne&s;s, their great and Unparalel'd Bold|ne&s;s of daring to come not onely on our Coa&s;t, but even into our very Channels, to the Ignominy of our Nation, and in De&s;pite and contempt of His Maje&s;ty, who is undoubtedly Soveraign of the Narrow Seas.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly,</HI> By the&s;e means other Princes and States may by our Ex|ample take the &s;ame Mea&s;ures, and make the &s;ame Law, whereby much Trea&s;ure may be &s;aved, which is very often &s;pent in maintaining Fleets in the <HI>Mediteranean</HI> Seas; witne&s;s, that of His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Brittain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> It is more than probable that by this means His Maje&s;ty may more peaceably Injoy his Right in <HI>Tangier,</HI> which hath been &s;o Expen&s;ive to him; for that that War is undoubtedly promoted and Abetted by the Jews of <HI>Algier,</HI> who by their Pur&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t that Barbarous King both with Men, Money, and Amunition; and will be able on all Occa&s;ions &s;till to do the &s;ame, if &s;ome effectual Cour&s;e be not taken to prevent it.</P>
