honour your Worth.</P>
<P>I will not be &s;o vain as to en|deavour

you are &s;ufficiently known to

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT being the manner of tho&s;e who
Write, to acquaint the Reader
with the De&s;ign of the Book;
if I had any in Publi&s;hing this be|&s;ides
your Diverti&s;ement, it was
chiefly to make the <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> and
<HI>Religiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of a People e&s;tee|med
<HI>Barbarous, Rude,</HI> and <HI>Sa|vage,</HI>
to reflect upon their Enor|mities,
who would be reckon'd
for the only <HI>Illuminati</HI> of both.
And to &s;hew that this <HI>Unlick'd,
<PB REF="6">
Uncultivated People</HI> agree with
the <HI>wi&s;e&s;t Nati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s,</HI> in making the
care of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> to
&s;uppre&s;s <HI>Vice</HI> and encourage <HI>Virtue,</HI>
as the only method to make a State
happy.</P>
<P>It was one of the <HI>Pedantick</HI> Va|nities
of the <HI>Grecians</HI> to repute all
<HI>Barbarous</HI> but them&s;elves; and al|beit
there are &s;ome who have the
&s;ame Opinion of every thing that is
diver&s;e from the Manners and Cu|&s;toms
of their own Country, yet tho&s;e
who acknowledge <HI>Humanity</HI> in all
its Habits, may in peru&s;ing the Re|marks
made upon the&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI>
meet with &s;omething that may <HI>civi|lize</HI>
the <HI>Title,</HI> and induce them to
think, that what is commonly call'd
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Barbarous,</HI> is but a different Mode
of <HI>Civility.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Truth of what is writ|ten,
I have us'd an Indu&s;try as
probable to en&s;ure me thereof, as the
nature of the Subject would give me
leave. Having fir&s;t travel'd the
Country, and remark'd as much as
&s;uch an occa&s;ion would afford, and
then retain'd a <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> with
&s;uch Per&s;ons, both <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI>
as I found be&s;t able to encrea&s;e and
amend my fir&s;t Remarks. So that
they are not barely the Occa&s;ionals of
a <HI>Journey,</HI> nor &s;crap'd up from <HI>Ca|&s;ual
Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> but the re&s;ult of
&s;ome Years <HI>In&s;pection</HI> into the Peo|ple
of whom I write; and that I
might not di&s;-ingeniou&s;ly impo&s;e up|on
<PB REF="7">
your Belief, I have not content|ed
my &s;elf with a &s;ingle Te&s;t, but
have rejected &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages which
have not had a &s;ufficient <HI>confirma|tion.</HI>
It being not my intent to be
known for Writing things &s;trange
and <HI>Romantick,</HI> but to be very
<HI>civil</HI> to the World, in putting no|thing
upon them but what is Firm
and Solid.</P>
<P>As for the Dre&s;s wherein they ap|pear
(though perhaps &s;uitable enough
for the matter) I have been therein
&s;o negligent as not greatly to regard
it, except in the Narrative to pre|&s;erve
<HI>coherence.</HI> For I conceived,
I was not to pre&s;ent you with the Cu|&s;toms
of a Nation as <HI>I made them,</HI>
but as they were in <HI>them&s;elves,</HI>
<PB REF="7">
which could &s;carcely be done, but by
expo&s;ing them (thus) <HI>naked.</HI></P>
<P>The Narrative of the late Re|volutions,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> is that for which to
&s;ome I may &s;eem the le&s;s accountable,
becau&s;e I in&s;inuate a want of Pub|lick
Records among the Moors, out
of which it was to have been col|lected.
But there was no &s;uch great
need of tho&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tances in Penning
the Annals of our Age; and the
Narrative a&s;cends no higher then
the Period of the <HI>Xeriffian</HI> Family,
and the Divi&s;ion of <HI>Kiram</HI>'s &V;&s;ur|pation
of the Crown of <HI>Morocco,</HI>
which are very fre&s;h in the minds of
the <HI>Moors.</HI> And yet for the clearer
Certainty herein, I have had the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome Ancient ob&s;erving
<PB REF="8">
<HI>Moors,</HI> who were Actors in the
late Revolves. But my best help
I had, was from an Aged, Inqui&s;i|tive,
noting Per&s;on, an <HI>Hebrew
Sabio,</HI> one <HI>Jo&s;eph Me&s;&s;ias,</HI> who
for many Years had been Secretary
of <HI>Tituan,</HI> and with great dili|gence
had ob&s;erved <HI>Memoirs</HI> of
what a long time had happened in
that part of <HI>Barbary.</HI> In what
concerns the War between <HI>Gaylan</HI>
and <HI>Taffilet,</HI> I confe&s;s I am not ve|ry
particular, becau&s;e much thereof
related to <HI>Tanger;</HI> but what is
here wanting, may be &s;upplyed in
the modern Story of that Ancient
City.</P>
<P>How far I have been from Tran|&s;cribing
<HI>Leo Afer,</HI> which &s;ome may
<PB REF="8">
&s;u&s;pect, will ea&s;ily appear by compa|ring
what is contain'd in the Re|marks
of <HI>We&s;t Barbary,</HI> with his
De&s;cription of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>That I have not &s;poken more large|ly
of their Colleges, needs no other
excu&s;e, than that they now u&s;e none;
and the like may be an&s;wer'd for
my &s;ilence of their Libraries. And
how famous &s;oever <HI>Mauritania Tin|gitana</HI>
hath been in former Ages
for a Race of <HI>Literati,</HI> yet now there
is little hope to &s;ee a Re&s;tauration of
their Studies, if it be con&s;idered
what &s;mall regard the pre&s;ent <HI>Moors</HI>
bear to Learning: Which I under|&s;tood
from <HI>Cidi Abdella, Gaylan's</HI>
Secretary, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renegado of a
bold Capacity; to whom, when I
<PB REF="9">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="9">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB REF="10">
was prai&s;ing the Ancient Learning
of <HI>Fez, &amp;c.</HI> he told me, That now
the <HI>Moors</HI> were not very fond of
Booki&s;h Inclinations, being gene|rally
addicted either to Military or
Mechanick Employments: and when
I read to him out of <HI>Don Diego
Savedra Taxardo</HI> (in the 66th of
his <HI>Empre&s;&s;as Politicas)</HI> how that
a Learned Age might have as little
Valour as Devotion: That all know|ledge
was &s;uperfluous which taught
the People more than to <HI>Obey, en|dure
Travel,</HI> and <HI>Conquer:</HI> That
great Di&s;cur&s;i&s;ts were apt to intrigue
Affairs, di&s;pute the Princes Re&s;olu|tions,
and &s;tir up the People: That
it was the best Obedience, which was
rather Credulous then Inqui&s;itive:
<PB REF="10">
That the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, &s;o much
enrich'd with the Spoils, and ele|vated
with the Trophies of many
Nations, reckon it among their
<HI>Happine&s;&s;es,</HI> not to have their Con|&s;ultations
lime-twigg'd with Quirks
and Sophi&s;ms of Philo&s;ophical Per|&s;ons,
and make Illiterature one of
their chief Engines of Empire:
That the City may be taken, while
the Mathematician is delinea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">g
the Fortification: That Nations,
Provinces, Colonies, have grown
great by Indu&s;trious, and not Poring
Arts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> While I was thus reading
to the attentive di&s;cerning Renega|do,
he broke out into a &s;ort of Ex|ultation,
and call'd <HI>Muley Mahu|med</HI>
to witne&s;s, that he thought
<PB REF="11">
<HI>Savedra</HI> (the Author I read) was
a <HI>Moor,</HI> or otherwi&s;e he could never
have &s;o punctually de&s;cribed the
<HI>Humour,</HI> and <HI>Sentiments of the</HI>
Moors <HI>concerning Learning:</HI> ad|ding
withal, that if they who in their
pre&s;ent Illiterature were &s;o prone to
Sedition, that they would be much
more &s;o, if they were heated with
Booki&s;h Speculations, and had their
Black humour chaf'd and quicken'd
with Subtilizing Studies.</P>
<P>The next thing which may &s;eem
herein omitted, is, that which would
have be&s;t plea&s;ed the <HI>Virtuo&s;i,</HI> an
account of their Libraries, for which
I was once &s;ollicited by a Letter
from a Stranger, in the Year 1664.
who de&s;ign'd an &V;niver&s;al Cata|logue
<PB REF="11">
of Ancient and Modern Wri|ters,
and their Books: And though
he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd me with great hopes of
finding great &s;tore of Books in <HI>Bar|bary</HI>
for his purpo&s;e; yet upon En|quiry,
I met with nothing but Di&s;|appointment,
and that the <HI>Moors</HI>
are &s;o far from having excellent Li|braries,
that they wonder to &s;ee any
Book of Age or Volume in their
own Language. This I under&s;tood
from <HI>Cidi Hamet Cogez</HI> (former|ly
<HI>Alcayd</HI> of <HI>Alcaz&agrave;r)</HI> who when
in <HI>Tanger</HI> coming to &s;ee the Pub|lick
Library that we had Founded
there, where I &s;hewed him a MS.
in his own Character concerning
their Religion, he ki&s;s'd, hugg'd,
laid it to his Brow, upon the Crown
<PB REF="12">
of his Head, lifted it up to Hea|ven,
and in every Circum&s;tance ap|pear'd
therewith &s;o much tran&s;port|ed,
that I could &s;carce re&s;cue it out
of his Embraces.</P>
<P>The &s;ame MS. I &s;hewed to a <HI>Ta|lib</HI>
(who was one of <HI>Tafilets</HI> Em|h&eacute;rkin,
or Me&s;&s;engers of State, &s;ent
to Compliment His Excellency the
Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, The Illu&s;trious
Lord <HI>H. Howard</HI> at <HI>Tanger)</HI> who
e&s;teem'd it &s;o great a Rarity, that
he &s;ollicited the Amba&s;&s;ador to beg or
buy it for him at any Rate. This
Manu&s;cript is now in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> His
Grace. It is the fir&s;t part of the
<HI>Mu&s;tadarif</HI> (or, as the <HI>Talib</HI> Ex|pounded
it) The <HI>Clean Book.</HI> It
<PB REF="12">
was compos'd by <HI>Alfach&igrave; Mahumed
Ebn Ahmed Alchab,</HI> and Copyed
into that fair Letter, wherein it is
now extant, by <HI>Ali Ebn Abd'|alir&aacute;hman
ebn Mahumed,</HI> a Native
of <HI>Suz,</HI> who fini&s;hed it in the &s;econd
Moneth <HI>Giamadi, Anno Hegirae,</HI>
1005.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Stories have betray'd
me to an unintended length, for
which I hope to make &s;ome amends
in what follows; in which I have
endeavour'd, like a merciful Exe|cutioner,
not to protract your Pain.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF NARRATION
Of the late Revolutions in the

of Fez and Morocco.</HEAD>
<P>THIS <HI>Narrative</HI> of the <HI>Revo|lutions</HI>
of <HI>Barbary,</HI> &s;hall not be
derived beyond the <HI>Annals</HI> of
our own <HI>Memory.</HI> For who&s;e
clearer introduction, the contexture of
affaires invites us to &s;tep back to the
notorious <HI>change,</HI> which hapned about
the year 1508. Near which time the <HI>Ma|rine
Familie</HI> approaching to its de&s;ign'd
period and determination, it fortun'd
that a certain <HI>Alfachi,</HI> or <HI>Mori&s;h Priest,</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Dara,</HI> began to grow
into great reputation with the people,
by rea&s;on of his <HI>high pretentions</HI> to <HI>piety</HI>
and <HI>fervent zeal</HI> for their <HI>Law,</HI> illu&s;tra|ted
by a &s;tubborn rigidity of conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="2" REF="14">
and <HI>outward &s;anctity</HI> of life. <HI>His</HI> fir&s;t
name was <HI>Mahumet Ben Amet;</HI> but pre|tending
to be de&s;cended from their <HI>Pro|phet,</HI>
he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be called
<HI>Zeriffe:</HI> A <HI>Title</HI> which the Kindred of
that <HI>Impostor</HI> have appropriated to them|&s;elves,
and made the <HI>character</HI> of that
whole <HI>Family.</HI> The credit of his preten|ded
<HI>Pedegree,</HI> was another <HI>Engine</HI> where|with
he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the peo|ples
likeing, which together with his
&s;eeming &s;everity, made him of no vulgar
e&s;teem with a generation, who from time
to time have been fooled with &s;uch <HI>Moun|tebanks
in Religion.</HI></P>
<P>The great applau&s;e and approbation
his per&s;on met with from the <HI>Moores,</HI>
kindled in him no le&s;s an Ambition then
of making him&s;elf <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Mauritania
Tingitana;</HI> which mu&s;t needs have proved
a very <HI>Hypocondriacal de&s;igne,</HI> had it not
been a&s;&s;i&s;ted with a favourable conjun|cture
of affaires. For the <HI>Mauritanian
Princes</HI> had a long time weakned them|&s;elves
with <HI>civil di&s;cords;</HI> and the <HI>Por|tugals</HI>
taking that advantageous occa&s;ion,
had farr advanced their <HI>Armes,</HI> and arri|ved

<PB N="3" REF="14">
and were &s;till under a daylie &s;ucce&s;s

de&s;irous of <HI>Novelties,</HI> and &s;en&s;ible of op|pre&s;&s;ions,
both from their own and for|reign
<HI>powers,</HI> were &s;ufficiently inclina|ble

<P>This now <HI>Zeriffe,</HI> who wanted neither
<HI>Witt</HI> nor <HI>Ambition</HI> to conduct or enter|pri&s;e
an innovation, found by the <HI>Starrs,</HI>
in who&s;e <HI>Science</HI> his <HI>Legend</HI> makes him
very skilful, that the time was not yet
&s;uitable for &s;o great an <HI>undertaking.</HI> Re|ligion
was his pretence, and nothing
could have been &s;o fit be&s;ide to advance
him in the e&s;timation of <HI>the many.</HI></P>
<P>To facilitate his de&s;igns, he &s;ent his
three Sons, <HI>Abdel, Abnet,</HI> and <HI>Mahumet</HI> in
<HI>Pilgrimage</HI> to <HI>Mecha</HI> and <HI>Medina,</HI> to vi&s;it
and wor&s;hip the Sepulchre of their <HI>Great

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters">uired among the &s;uper&s;titious
<HI>people,</HI> who could hardly be kept from
ki&s;&s;ing their garments, and adoreing them

tragical ge&s;tures, and other pa&s;&s;ionate
<HI>Interjections</HI> of <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> could expre&s;s;

received them with content and joy,
and perceiving the favour and opinion of
the people toward him, to continue the

u&s;e thereof, and thereupon &s;ent <HI>Abnet</HI>
and <HI>Mahumet</HI> to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Fez,</HI> where
they were kindly received by the too <HI>cre|dulous
King,</HI> who made the elder, <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI>
of the famous <HI>Colledge Amadorac,</HI> and the
younger, <HI>Tutor</HI> of his own Sons. <HI>Ad|vanced</HI>
thus in favour at <HI>Court,</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI>

Father, they de&s;ired leave of the <HI>King</HI> to

induceing him to believe, that they would
ea&s;ily draw the <HI>Portugal Moors</HI> to their

Kings brother, re&s;i&s;ted the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">tion,

of <HI>Sanctity,</HI> which being once <HI>Victo|rious,</HI>
might grow <HI>in&s;olent,</HI> and forget|ful

But the King intoxicated with
the Opinion of the&s;e <HI>Pilgrims Sanctity,</HI>
rejected his Brothers nece&s;&s;ary cautions,
and gave them a <HI>Banner</HI> and <HI>Drum,</HI> with
<HI>Letters</HI> of <HI>Credence</HI> to the <HI>Princes</HI> and
<HI>Cities</HI> of <HI>Barbary,</HI> with twenty hor&s;e|men
to attend them. Many Wonderful
&s;ucce&s;&s;es awaited upon their <HI>actions,</HI> and
all things thrived &s;o well under their
conduct, that at la&s;t the King of <HI>Fez,</HI> who
all along applauded his own Victories in
theirs, began to di&s;ta&s;t them. And &s;eeing
they had poy&s;oned the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI>
and made <HI>Amet Zeriff</HI> to be proclaimed
King in his &s;tead, he mi&s;tru&s;ted his own
&s;afety, and began but too late to repent
his approveing of an <HI>armed hypocri&s;ie.
Puft up</HI> with their <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;es</HI> they forgot
their <HI>obedience,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Saints</HI> deny
the King the fifth part of their &s;poyles,
and only &s;ent him &s;ix Hor&s;es and &s;ix Ca|mels,
and tho&s;e lean and ill &s;hapen. The
<HI>King</HI> demands his dues, but they an&s;wer|ed,
That &s;eeing they were lawful &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors
to <HI>Mahumet,</HI> they ought to pay no
<PB N="6" REF="16">
man <HI>Tribute,</HI> and that they had more right
in <HI>Affrica</HI> then him&s;elf; but if he would
re&s;pect them as his <HI>Friends</HI> and <HI>Allies,</HI>
they were not froward to embrace him
under that quality; but if he expected
any more at their hands, they doubted
not, but as they had had power to <HI>offend</HI>
the <HI>Christians,</HI> they &s;hould not be de&s;ti|tute
in defending of them&s;elves; By
which it appeared, that they took up
<HI>Armes,</HI> not out of <HI>Love</HI> to their <HI>Country</HI>
and zeale for their Religion, but out of
a de&s;ire of Rule.</P>
<P>The &s;word by both &s;ides was cho&s;en
to umpire the conte&s;t, which awarded
for the <HI>Zeriffs.</HI> For upon the encounter
of both the Armies, the <HI>Fe&s;&s;an</HI> Forces af|ter
a long and doubtful Battle were de|feated;
and the <HI>Zeriffs</HI> &s;o well impro|ved

Their Rebellions appeared under the
&s;pecious pretences of mending &s;ome

another, under the plea&s;ing di&s;gui&s;e

the power &s;till remained in the &s;ame <HI>Fa|milie,</HI>

left to <HI>Abdalla</HI> &s;on of <HI>Muley Sheck,</HI> who
&s;carce warm'd the throne, till he was vio|lently
pull'd thence by his Uncle <HI>Sidan,</HI>

from the troubles of a <HI>Crown.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Muley Sidan</HI> once more joyned
<HI>Fez</HI> with <HI>Morocco,</HI> and in him&s;elf made
<PB N="8" REF="17">

But he was much infe&s;ted both by Land

two oppo&s;ite <HI>factions</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him at
Land, and the <HI>Pyrates</HI> of <HI>Salla</HI> and <HI>Al|gier</HI>
by Sea. But his great valour main|tain'd
him again&s;t both. For by his own
Arms he pacifyed the tumults at Land,
and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Engli&s;h
Shipping, he de&s;troyed the Pyrats of <HI>Sal|la,</HI>

yet &s;erve only to the benefit
of the world. It is the Excellencie of
our Office, to be In&s;truments where|by
happine&s;s is delivered to the Na|tions.
Pardon me Sir, this is not to

my &s;elf; but I &s;peak this, becau&s;e

a work that &s;hall a&s;cend

I, who much reverence the Peace and

Je&s;us was the Lyon of the Tribe of

<P><PB N="15" REF="20">
The Traders into the <HI>Levant</HI> have rea|&s;on
to bewail, that the condition of his
Maje&s;ties affaires would not give him
leave to entertain this motion: which in
all probability can never be revived with
&s;uch promi&s;ing circum&s;tances, as it might
then have been enterprized; for tho&s;e
Pyrats were then incon&s;iderable to what
they are now; for by the computation
of their encrea&s;e in Shipping and Skill in
Navigation, if not timely &s;ubdued, they in
&s;hort time may bid defiance to the Chri|&s;tian
in the Mid-land Seas. And albeit the
propo&s;al was not embraced, yet it loud|ly
&s;poke <HI>Sidan</HI> a Prince of Generous De|&s;igns,
and Noble Ambitions; and one
who aimed at the Advance and Security
of Trade, the Common intere&s;t of the
World.</P>
<P><HI>Muley Sidan</HI> having reduced the af|fairs
of State to a great degree of Quiet,
he fini&s;h'd both Life and Reign at once,
contrary to the example of the mo&s;t of
his Predece&s;&s;ors, whereof few either
Reigned to the natural length of their
Life, or were &s;uffered to live beyond the
violent &s;hortne&s;s of their Reigne. Upon
<PB N="16" REF="21">
his Death, <HI>Muley Abdelmeleck</HI> his elde&s;t
Son, enter'd upon the fruition of his Fa|thers
Atchievements. He was a per&s;on of
much flegm and indifferency, naturally
fitted for a tame and peaceable Empire,
into which he was happily inaugurated,
but not long continued, for in the &s;e|cond
year of his reigne he was unnatu|rally
a&s;&s;a&s;ined by his &s;econd Brother
<HI>Luellud,</HI> who&s;e ambition broke all
bonds of Nature and Politie to a&s;cend a
Throne. But the infamous fratricide was
pre&s;ently thrown from his u&s;urped great|ne&s;s:
for having by a powerful example
taught the neare&s;t method to weare a
Crown, he was clande&s;tinely Murder'd
by his younge&s;t Brother <HI>Muley Hamet
Sheck,</HI> before he had accompli&s;h'd the
period of twenty Months in his King|dome.
And it is remarkable that <HI>Muley
Shek</HI> pretended to no vengeance of his
elde&s;t Brothers death in that of his &s;e|cond;
but that he acted it only cut of an
itch to obtain the Government, &s;econded
with a &s;u&s;pition of his own &s;afety; which
could not be great, while his Brother
might ju&s;tly fear him as a Rival for the
Kingdome.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="21">
<HI>Muley Sheck</HI> being the la&s;t of the Bro|thers,
and thereby without any to com|petition
him, he &s;tudied to make both
his Government and Per&s;on gratious to
the people. In which artifice he was &s;o
pro&s;perous, that no Sultan in <HI>Barbary</HI>
had equal'd him in a confluence of hap|pine&s;s.
The Skie of his Reigne was for
nineteen years &s;erene: and there were
no progno&s;ticks of alteration in his con|dition,
till <HI>Laella,</HI> one of his Wives,
began to be exorbitant in her appetites,
and to meditate di&s;loyalty to her Hus|band's
Bed. She is reported to have been
a woman of a refined &s;ubtilty, and learn|ed
in the mo&s;t artful methods of &s;teale|ing
her plea&s;ures. But at length &s;he fell
exce&s;&s;ively enamour'd of her own kins|man,
one <HI>Cidi Kirum,</HI> whom the King
had adopted into his <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Conver|&s;ation.</HI>
This <HI>Kirum</HI> was of a popular in|clination,
and skilful in feeding the hu|mours
of the people. He had been at
<HI>Mecha</HI> in Devotion, and of cour&s;e recei|ved
for that <HI>vi&s;itation</HI> the title of <HI>Hadge,</HI>
granted to all that have performed the
<HI>Hage,</HI> or Pilgrimage to their Prophets
Tomb. By this, and a great &s;hew of ex|terior
<PB N="18" REF="22">
Religion, he had with men of all
capacities purcha&s;ed a &s;ignificant repu|tation.
And albeit he was a wel-wi&s;her
to an Innovation, the common de&s;igne
of their pretended Piety, yet the pre&s;ent
face of affaires look'd very di&s;agreeable
upon &s;uch an enterpri&s;e. For the King
&s;o rul'd, that all had cau&s;e to love, and
none to feare him, and the courteou&s;ne&s;s
of his per&s;onal behaviour, had &s;ecured
him a large &s;hare in the wor&s;t of his Sub|jects
bo&s;oms; His cu&s;tom being to puni&s;h
and &s;pare none, who were convict offen|dors
again&s;t their Law, the known Rule
both of their Religion and Politie. And
for the greater di&s;couragement of
all commotions, the <HI>Zeriffian</HI> name
was grown &s;acred with the Moors,
through its long continuance: and they
concluded its pro&s;perity a Divine ap|probation
of its Right.</P>
<P><HI>Kirum</HI> no doubt was &s;till as coveteous
to enjoy the Crown, as <HI>Laella</HI> his Bed;
who&s;e amours at la&s;t grew to that height
of impatience, that nothing could quiet
them, but the embraces of her Paramour
in a Regal State; which &s;he plotted
with a feminine invention. The death of
<PB N="19" REF="22">
the King her Husband was the only &s;e|cure
<HI>Recipe</HI> for her di&s;temper, but alto|gether
of an un&s;afe accompli&s;hment, if
enterpri&s;ed by open violence. Where|fore
&s;he is reported to have e&s;&s;ayed his
Death by Sorcery's; in which wickedne&s;s
(Story tels us) that the Mahumetan Wo|men
have alwaies been dexterous. But
not preci&s;ely to determine, by what way
<HI>Muley Hamet Sheck</HI> came to his Grave,
it is certain that his end was &s;uddain
and unexpected, and that he &s;hut up his
life before he had &s;een the twentieth
yeare of his Reign. His decea&s;e was
much lamented, and the more becau&s;e it
came un&s;u&s;pected. The Government
lineally de&s;cended upon his Son <HI>Muley
Lab&egrave;&s;h,</HI> a child of three years old, whom
his dying Father bequeath'd to the pro|tection
of <HI>Kirum El Hadge,</HI> and other
Grandees of the Kingdome, appointing
them to admini&s;ter the affaires of State
in <HI>Lab&egrave;&s;h</HI>'s name, till he was come to
the age of eleven years. In which time
<HI>Kirum</HI> was &s;o balanc'd with his fellow
Regents, that he dur&s;t not attempt the
lea&s;t alteration. But &s;uch was the crafty
conduct of his demeanor, that he had
<PB N="20" REF="23">
made many of the <HI>Almocadens</HI> among the
<HI>Al&agrave;rbs</HI> to be his <HI>creatures</HI> and ready at
his Devotion, and of who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance
he might rely, when he &s;aw it convenient
to time a Revolution: which he deferr'd
to the entrance of the &s;econd yeare of
<HI>Lab&egrave;&s;h's</HI> reigne, being the thirteenth of
his age. At which time <HI>Kirum</HI> &s;ecretly
retired from Court, and was not heard
of, till he appear'd in the head of a nu|merous
Army of <HI>Al&agrave;rbs,</HI> whom he had al|lured
into Rebellion with the promi&s;es
of large Incoms, the baite di&s;loyalty &s;till
leaps at.</P>
<P><HI>Lab&egrave;&s;h</HI> quickly took the Alarm, and
with con&s;iderable Forces marcht toward
<HI>Kirum,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible to end the Warr in the
place where it was begun. The Moors
highly extol the valour and conduct of
this young King, who forgetting the de|lights
and toys of that age, devoted him|&s;elf
to the &s;everities of Military Di&s;ci|pline,
con&s;tantly watching in the Camp,
or courageou&s;ly fighting in the Battel.
For four years His fortunes and <HI>Kirum</HI>'s
had their vici&s;&s;itudes, for &s;o long they
fought with dubious pre&s;ages of the
event; till Treachery at la&s;t is &s;aid to have
<PB N="21" REF="23">
given <HI>Kirum</HI> that conque&s;t which cou|rage
could not; for <HI>Lab&egrave;&s;h</HI> being invited
by <HI>Kirum</HI> to receive his Recantation,
met with a Barbarous death, where he
hoped to receive a Loyal &s;ubjection.
Others report that <HI>Kirum</HI> &s;lew him with
his own hands in that fatal Battel, which
proved the fini&s;hing overthrow.</P>
<P>After the death of <HI>Lab&egrave;&s;h, Kirum</HI> be|came
too powerful for the re&s;i&s;tance of
his &s;cattered Forces, haveing none left
under who&s;e conduct they might venture
their la&s;t Efforts; &s;o that now all oppo|&s;itions
being removed with the King,
<HI>Kirum</HI> made a quiet march to <HI>Morocco,</HI>
where the Citizens received him with
all the &s;ignifications of &s;ubjection, in
who&s;e imitation the adjoyning <HI>Cav&iacute;las</HI>
brought in the pledges of their Allegi|ance
to <HI>Kirum:</HI> which they did not in|termit,
till by a natural death he re&s;ign'd
the Kingdom to his Son <HI>Muley Boucar,</HI>
who after the &s;hort reigne of three
months was dethron'd by <HI>Taffalete,</HI> of
which Revolution more will be &s;aid in
the &s;tory of that prevailing <HI>Zeriff.</HI></P>

not to depo&s;e <HI>Kirum</HI> from being King,

his Subject. His fir&s;t Mu&s;ters con&s;i&s;ted

to which were daily acce&s;sions of the
Neighboring <HI>Alm&oacute;cadens,</HI> which helpt
to adju&s;t his In&s;urrection. His Forces
being &s;oon increa&s;ed above his hopes,

Metropolis of the Kingdom of that name.
This ancient City was now govern'd by

&s;tole away to <HI>Morocco,</HI> as not daring

it became the ea&s;ie Atchievement

<P><HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI> by his Succe&s;&s;es began to be
the envy of <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> who for &s;ome

him&s;elf with the &s;olitary Domi|nion

Hou&s;e of that name, which for its Reli|gious

or Refuge for Offenders. The In|habitants
of <HI>Z&aacute;wia</HI> are reported to be
very numerous and Warlike, yet by rea|&s;on
of remotene&s;s, they created <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI>
very &s;mall Di&s;turbances; be&s;ides, <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>
was unwilling to refer him&s;elf
to the uncertain Deci&s;ion of the Sword,
which, in all probability, mu&s;t have gi|ven
the Victory to <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi,</HI> by who&s;e

<HI>Saph&iacute;an,</HI> one whom <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI> had not yet
entirely &s;ubdued, by what method their

continuance of his <HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI> from his hand.
Under this Cloak <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI> received him
into his Tent, and thereby gave him the
opportunity of Murthering him, which
he effected with one Stab. The Mur|therer
had his Accomplices ready to
make his E&s;cape, which was the le&s;s dif|ficult,
becau&s;e <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI> had no Guards,

the Twelfth Year of his Revolt, he in|c&egrave;&s;&s;antly
marcht to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
Country, which he found ready at his
Devotion; either becau&s;e the People
<PB N="28" REF="27">
were unprovided for Oppo&s;ition; or,
that they thought <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>'s Superi|ority
was le&s;s obnoxious to exception,

<HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>'s Regiment; onely <HI>Fez</HI> and

their Reduction. But at la&s;t they yield|ed
upon Articles, <HI>Arzila</HI> having fir&s;t
&s;hown them the way. <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>'s next
March was to <HI>Tituan,</HI> govern'd by the
Ancient and Worthy Family of the <HI>Nar|&s;is,</HI>
out of which he had received a Wife,
and by that Relation was welcome to the
Supremacie of that City.</P>
<P><HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> having brought this part

to return to <HI>Z&aacute;wia:</HI> But before he left
the Country, he took from the Grandees
thereof, the be&s;t A&s;&s;urances he was able
for their Obedience and Fidelity. Next,
he di&s;po&s;ed the Towns of greate&s;t Im|portance,
to the Government of his Sons
and Favorites. To his elde&s;t Son <HI>Abdal|la</HI>
he entru&s;ted the Rule of <HI>Salla,</HI> which
he had ob&s;erved proner to Sedition then
<PB N="29" REF="27">
the re&s;t, and yet much addicted to Per|&s;ons
famed for Piety, for which <HI>Abdalla</HI>
was arrived at a Saint&s;hip. To his &s;e|cond
Son <HI>Mahumed,</HI> he committed the
care of <HI>Fez,</HI> to whom he &s;aw the People
thereof have a peculiar Inclination. To
his third Son <HI>Hamet Z&eacute;er,</HI> or <HI>Hamet the
le&s;s,</HI> he gave the command of <HI>Sheh&agrave;ll,</HI> a
Mountain of rude Inhabitants, yet much
addicted to obey a fierce nature, where|with
<HI>Hamet Z&eacute;er</HI> was furni&s;hed. <HI>Arzila</HI>
he left to <HI>Benz&egrave;ir, a Thing of his own
framing:</HI> And <HI>Alcazar</HI> to <HI>Cidi Benz&iacute;an.</HI>
After this Partition, he returned to his
Religious <HI>Z&aacute;wia,</HI> where in great Peace
he enjoyed the fruits of his War, making
the ea&s;ine&s;s of his Yoak an argument
with the People to bear it.</P>
<P>But the memory of <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI>'s trea|cherous
Death (compa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Ben-Bou|car)</HI>
was &s;till fre&s;h in the Bre&s;ts of tho&s;e
Sons, who&s;e Fathers had their Fortunes
thereby depre&s;s'd; which <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI>
as he could not but know, &s;o he could
not but conclude, <HI>That the vindictive
Spirit of a</HI> Moor <HI>would take the first oc|ca&s;ion

of Peace, but as Pledges of his
Care, whom being as yet in their non-age,
he loved to Print with the Chara|cters
of a peaceable acquie&s;cence in his
Authority. Among the&s;e Youths, young
<HI>Gaylan</HI> was mo&s;t con&s;iderable, and in|deed
the only Per&s;on that he detained:
who&s;e Story now &s;ucceeds, in which will
be &s;upplyed what is here wanting of <HI>Ben-Boucar.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Beniworfut,</HI> near to <HI>Arzila,</HI> lived
the Family of the <HI>Gaylans,</HI> which was
of that &s;ort of <HI>Moors</HI> &s;tiled <HI>Barab&agrave;rs,</HI> and
to which through flux of time, the Go|vernment
of that <HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI> was become He|reditary.
This Hou&s;e (though never low
or ob&s;cure) began to be &s;ignally advan|ced
in <HI>Ali Gaylan</HI> the Father, which
proved but a Prophe&s;ie of its downfall
in <HI>El Hader</HI> the Son; who&s;e Ambitio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
lo&s;t what the others Humility had ob|tained.
<HI>Ali</HI> was in great favor with <HI>Hai|&aacute;&s;hi,</HI>
and a chief Engine of his advance|ment,
in which he was ob&s;erved not
much to endeavor his own. But his great|e&s;t
Renown &s;prang from his Zeal for the
<PB N="31" REF="28">
<HI>Mahumetan Law,</HI> an Artifice which &s;el|dom
failes, &amp; a knack with which who|&s;oever
is gifted, cannot want Reverence
among the <HI>Moors. Arzila</HI> being much
moved with his Sanctity, invited him to
a re&s;idence among them, which they re|warded
with con&s;iderable Rents, and
great Te&s;timonies of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>This <HI>Ali Gaylan</HI> &s;pent the la&s;t Scene
of his Life with great &s;atisfaction to
<HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI>'s pro&s;perity, whom at his Death
he left without any threatning Progno|&s;ticks
of an alteration in his State: But
when he grew &s;en&s;ible of the near ap|proaches
of his end, he called for his Be|loved
<HI>El Hader,</HI> to whom he recom|mended
the care of his Family, Govern|ment
of his <HI>Cavlla,</HI> imitation of his
Conver&s;ation and Faith to <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi. El
Hader</HI> was too young for the undertaking
all this when his Father dyed, which
cau&s;ed the provident Parent to leave him
to the careful Tuition of <HI>Hamet Benz&iacute;an,
Almocad&egrave;n</HI> of <HI>Beni-Har&ograve;s,</HI> with whom he
remained, till removed thence by <HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI>
after the reducement of <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi.</HI>
About the xxiii of his Age, this <HI>El Hader
Ben Ali Gaylan,</HI> was married to the
<PB N="32" REF="29">
Daughter of one <HI>Akadim,</HI> a principal
Man in <HI>Beniworfut,</HI> upon which Mar|riage
he had licen&s;e to return home; a
Conce&s;sion that proved very fatal to
<HI>Ben-Boucar.</HI> For <HI>El Hader</HI> being got
to his own Territories, where he received
an affectionate wellcome; there hap|pened
a Commotion in the populous <HI>Ca|v&iacute;la</HI>'s
of <HI>Saphean, Sh&aacute;wia,</HI> and <HI>Hom&agrave;r,</HI>
(all <HI>Alarbes)</HI> which denyed to pay <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI>
the accu&s;tomed Rights, &amp; were &s;o
far from an obedient tender thereof, that
they inhumanely murthered his two Bre|thren,
<HI>Abdelh&aacute;lac</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;s&iacute;nievi,</HI> whom
he &s;ent to demand them.</P>
<P>The news of this In&s;urrection quickly
arrived <HI>El Hader,</HI> who thereupon, with
&s;ome of the be&s;t Hor&s;e of his <HI>Cav&iacute;la,</HI> in|&s;tantly
po&s;ted to <HI>Alcazar,</HI> where accord|ing
to Intelligence he met with <HI>Ali Ben
Hamet, Hai&aacute;&s;hi</HI>'s Murtherer, whom with
his own hand he killed, in revenge of the
Murther he had committed upon his Fa|thers
Friend: In who&s;e death, he pull'd
down one of <HI>Ben-Boucars</HI> be&s;t Support|ers
in this Canton of his Dominion. Next
he &s;peeded to <HI>Arz&iacute;la,</HI> for&s;aken by <HI>Ben-Boucars</HI>
Alc&aacute;yde, who upon the tydings
<PB N="33" REF="29">
of <HI>Hamets</HI> death, and the <HI>Al&aacute;rbes</HI> revolt,
dur&s;t not tru&s;t him&s;elf among a People
whom he &s;aw zealou&s;ly to favor his Ma|&s;ters
Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon this <HI>Gaylan</HI> appeared at <HI>Ar|z&iacute;la,</HI>
which was very acceptable to his
Fathers old Admirers, who readily yield|ed
him their utmo&s;t A&s;si&s;tances, and
were &s;econded with &s;everal of the adja|cent
<HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI>'s. <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> coming to
cha&s;tize the &s;editious <HI>Al&aacute;rbes,</HI> and to a|venge
his Brothers blood, which he &s;pee|dily
di&s;patc'd; his next care was to ren|der
<HI>Gaylan</HI> &s;en&s;ible of his Deportment,
who, upon his advance, took &s;anctuary
in <HI>Arz&iacute;la,</HI> where he lay immured, till &s;uch
time as nece&s;sity forced <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> to
withdraw his Levies. Upon every &s;uch
retreat, <HI>Gaylan</HI> was &s;till at his wonted
di&s;turbances, and yet upon every re|turn
of the Enemy, he betook him&s;elf
to the protection of <HI>Arzila;</HI> Out of
which nothing could fetch him, but a
clo&s;e, tedious, and expen&s;ive Siege, a
thing ill agreeing with the <HI>Moors</HI> Cu&s;tom
and Provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> weary of that Fatigue, in
which for &s;ome Years he had been exer|ci&s;ed,
<PB N="34" REF="30">
and whereof he &s;aw no end, pro|ferr'd
<HI>Gaylan</HI> this Accommodation: That
if he would pay him the accu&s;tomary
Tributes, and an acknowledgement of
&s;uperiority, he &s;hould peaceably po&s;&s;e&s;s
the Government of <HI>Arzila,</HI> and his own
<HI>Cav&iacute;la. Gaylan</HI> was not backward to ac|cept
an Accommodation &s;o favorable to
his pre&s;ent Condition and future De|&s;igns;
being at that time &s;hut up in <HI>Ar|zila,</HI>
and yet entertaining an ambition
of making him&s;elf Lord of the Coun|trey.
This accommodation being rati|fyed,
<HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> returned home, and
<HI>Gaylan</HI> was &s;et at liberty to take his Di|verti&s;ements
in the Countrey, where his
plau&s;ible Fortune and Per&s;onage, Zeal
for their Law, and re&s;ervation of Car|riage,
made the Grandees of the Coun|trey
greatly affected with his Society.
<HI>Gaylan</HI> finding him&s;elf under &s;o favorable
an A&s;pect, thought of Strengthning his
Intentions by contracting Alliances with
the be&s;t <HI>Casts:</HI> whereupon he took him
a &s;econd Wife, a Daughter of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ian
Shot Almocad&egrave;m</HI> of the <HI>Cavila</HI> called <HI>An|gera,</HI>
a Warlike Family, and de&s;cended
of the <HI>Andalu&s;ian</HI> Moors bani&s;hed <HI>Spain.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="30">
His third Wife was the Daughter of <HI>Co|g&egrave;r
Alc&aacute;yde</HI> of <HI>Alcazar,</HI> and a leading
Per&s;on in that part of the Countrey.
His fourth was a Virgin Daughter of
<HI>M&uacute;fadal,</HI> Governor of <HI>Tituan,</HI> which
made up the <HI>legal number</HI> of <HI>four,</HI> &s;o ma|ny
being allowed by their Prophet: up|on
the death of his &s;econd Wife, to keep
up the account, he marryed the Daugh|ter
of one <HI>Me&s;&s;imd,</HI> a popular Per&s;on in
<HI>Titu&agrave;n,</HI> and de&s;cended of a Saint.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Alliances he got an Intere&s;t
both in the Per&s;ons and Places of great|e&s;t
moment in this part of the Countrey,
by which he was animated to break with
<HI>Ben-Boucar:</HI> a de&s;ign of &s;uch nature,
that <HI>Gaylan</HI> dur&s;t not venture thereon
in any open Declaration, but advi&s;edly
di&s;gui&s;ed it under a pretended Enter|pri&s;e
again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, Garri&s;on'd
in &s;everal Towns on the <HI>Barbary</HI> Coa&s;t,
maintained by the Crowns of <HI>Portugal</HI>
and <HI>Spain.</HI> Which to effect the better,
he fir&s;t &s;hewed the <HI>Moors</HI> how their
Prophet, both by his <HI>Example</HI> and
<HI>Doctrine,</HI> had taught them to exerci&s;e
their Revenge again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers of his
<HI>Law;</HI> and that whoever &s;hould dye in
<PB N="36" REF="31">
its Defen&s;e or Propagation, were a&s;&s;u|red
of Paradi&s;e; and then concluded,
how much it would redound to the ho|nor
of that Generation, if they &s;hould
drive the Chri&s;tians out of their Coun|trey,
to <HI>which</HI> and their Religion they
were the <HI>common Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>This Propo&s;al was &s;trangely moving
with People of all capacities, and the
report of <HI>Gaylans</HI> Intentions again&s;t the
Chri&s;tians, induced many to be his Fol|lowers,
who otherwi&s;e would have e&s;|chewed
his Company: But having drawn
in &s;ome by his Affinity, others with fair
Promi&s;es, and the generality with Re|ligious
Pretences, he began a little to
pull a&s;ide the Vail, and &s;hew the naked
Face of his De&s;ign. Having given &s;ome
Te&s;timonies of his Zeal and Valour a|gain&s;t
the Chri&s;tians, and enraged them
to an activity above what they had of late
expre&s;&s;ed: He likewi&s;e laid before them
their nece&s;sity of Union, and that they
&s;hould combine under one Leader, the
better to carry on what they had begun.
He al&s;o &s;et before them their unhappi|ne&s;s
to be governed by one whom <HI>age</HI>
and <HI>distance</HI> render'd &s;o unfit to relieve
<PB N="37" REF="31">
them, in ca&s;e of &s;udden nece&s;sity; and
withall magnifyed his Title to the Go|vernment
of the Country, equal to <HI>Ben-Boucars.</HI>
The People found no rea&s;on
to di&s;pute any part of <HI>Gaylans</HI> Harangue,
in which they could perceive he aimed at
nothing but their &s;afety. Whereupon
the <HI>Alc&aacute;yde</HI> of <HI>Alca&s;ar, El H&agrave;ders</HI> Fa|ther-in-law,
was the fir&s;t that declared
for his Government, who was &s;econded
with &s;everal other Grandees of the
Countrey, &s;o that in &s;hort time all the
<HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI>'s which <HI>Ben-Boucar</HI> had taken
from <HI>Hai&aacute;&s;hi,</HI> left him as they had done
their former Ma&s;ter, and adhered to
<HI>Gaylan.</HI> But <HI>S&aacute;lla</HI> and <HI>Titu&agrave;n</HI> utterly
di&s;&s;ented from the re&s;t, and in&s;tead of
yielding a tame &s;ubmi&s;sion to <HI>Gaylans</HI>
Empire, they altogether re&s;i&s;ted him.
This moved <HI>El Hader</HI> to advance his
Forces fir&s;t again&s;t <HI>Titu&agrave;n,</HI> which he
found very &s;tubborn: for <HI>Abdel Crim
Nac&s;is</HI> (the chief Governor thereof)
would be inclined to no thoughts of <HI>Pa|cification</HI>
or <HI>Surrender,</HI> while he could
cheri&s;h any hopes of being relieved by
his near Relative <HI>Ben-Boucar.</HI> But at
length, de&s;pairing of any Succors, and
<PB N="38" REF="32">
&s;eeing the great &s;poils <HI>Gaylan</HI> was like to
make of their Vineyards, Gardens, and
Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure about the Town,
which the Inhabitants highly valued for
their profit and delight, he &s;ought to
prevent him in that de&s;olation, by a ma|ture
and timely Addre&s;s for Peace:
which was welcome News to <HI>Gaylan,</HI> be|ing
very covetous to be Ma&s;ter of a place
&s;o con&s;iderable for Strength, Riches,
and Traffick. The Articles were &s;oon
concluded, <HI>Gaylan</HI> demanding no more
then their &s;ubjection, a con&s;tant Levy of
Soldiers to &s;erve him on occa&s;ions of
greater moment; and that one of his
own Election &s;hould be equal in the Go|vernment
with <HI>Nac&s;is.</HI> Upon this Paci|fication
with <HI>Tituan, Gaylan</HI> march'd a|gain&s;t
<HI>S&aacute;lla,</HI> which was under the Rule
of that great Saint, <HI>Abdala Ben-Boucar,</HI>
who upon weak Temptations retired to
the Ca&s;tle, leaving <HI>Gaylan</HI> the Signory of
the Town, wherein he placed &s;ome For|ces
of his own, to &s;ecure the Inhabitants
from Apo&s;tacy. But not long after, <HI>Ab|dala</HI>
being &s;ore pre&s;&s;ed for want of Pro|vi&s;ions,
and hopele&s;s of being &s;uccored
by his Father, privily quitted the Ca&s;tle,
<PB N="39" REF="32">
having fir&s;t of all &s;ent away in an Engli&s;h
Frigat, his Wives to <HI>Phed&aacute;lla.</HI></P>
<P>The gaining of this Ca&s;tle made <HI>Gay|lan</HI>
&s;ole Ma&s;ter of this North We&s;t Can|ton
of <HI>Barbary,</HI> beyond which he was
never able to enlarge his Territories; al|beit
he was &s;trugling for more room, as
fore&s;eeing that endeavors after more,
was the means to be &s;ecure of what he
had got already. He often tryed his va|lor
upon the <HI>Xerif, Hamet Boc&aacute;lla,</HI> chief

rai&s;ed him highly in the e&s;timate of his

<P><HI>Gaylan</HI> from his Youth was trained up

in Arms: And for the Adventures he had
made upon <HI>Tanger,</HI> when <HI>Portug&uacute;es,</HI> was
called the <HI>Almocaden</HI> of tho&s;e Fields.
But not to mention any thing of his pro|ceedings
again&s;t the Chri&s;tian (that be|ing
no de&s;ign of this Paper) we find him
con&s;tantly in War with the <HI>Moor. Ben-Boucar</HI>
was &s;till Ma&s;ter of <HI>Fez,</HI> and rea|dy
upon every frail Temptation to en|ter
<HI>Gaylans</HI> Frontiers, which kept them
both in continual Ho&s;tility. The Peo|ple
at length wearied out with the ince&s;|&s;ant
Troubles occa&s;ioned by the&s;e Ri|vals
for the Supremacy, were ready to
adhere to &s;ome third Party, able to &s;et|tle
the Government in &s;uch a &s;ingle Per|&s;on,
as both by Title and Strength &s;hould
be above an ordinary Competitor:
Which unexpectedly came to pa&s;s in the
Sixteen hundred and &s;ixty fifth of the
Crucifixion; for about the entrance of
that Year, <HI>Muley Re&s;hid</HI> fir&s;t appeared
with the Progno&s;ticks of a Revolution,
of whom I here &s;et down this &s;hort Ac|count.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Dara,</HI> in <HI>Numedia,</HI>
the Countrey of <HI>Mahumed Ben Amet,</HI>
Founder of the <HI>Xeriffian</HI> Empire, there
<PB N="45" REF="35">
aro&s;e a <HI>Mul&aacute;tto</HI> (one who&s;e Father was
white, and Mother black) one <HI>Re&s;hid
Ben Mahumed,</HI> a Native of the Town of
<HI>Taffilete,</HI> the place whether <HI>Mahumed</HI>
(the &s;econd Son of <HI>Mahumed Ben Amet)</HI>
the &s;econd of that Family (who was Em|peror
of <HI>Morocco)</HI> had confined his elde&s;t
Brother <HI>Amet,</HI> whom he had taken Pri|&s;oner.
This <HI>Re&s;hid</HI> ripening in Years
and di&s;cretion, began to make him&s;elf
known to the World by the name of the
<HI>Xeriff</HI> of <HI>Tafilete:</HI> By which Title he
made him&s;elf de&s;cended of the <HI>Xeriffian</HI>
Hou&s;e, which &s;o long had enjoyed the
Empire of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and of the Pro|phet
<HI>Mahumet. [Xeriff]</HI> (as was &s;aid)
being a Name peculiar to that Deceiver.
And becau&s;e a re&s;earch into <HI>More&s;co</HI> Ge|neologies
&s;hall have labour for the pains,
I &s;hall enquire no further after <HI>Re&s;hids</HI>
Pedigree, then to ob&s;erve that his Fa|ther
was one <HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> a Prince
of great Authority in <HI>Numedia,</HI> who be|&s;ides
his four legal Wives, had &s;everal
Concubines; of one of which, being
a <HI>Negra,</HI> he begot this <HI>Re&s;hid.</HI> His Fa|ther
dying while he was a minor, he was
committed to the Tuition of his Elder
<PB N="46" REF="36">
Brother <HI>Muley Hamet Ben-Mahumed.</HI>
This <HI>Re&s;hid</HI> having accompli&s;ht his Pu|pillage,
began to look into his Conditi|on,
and to enquire what was left him by
his decea&s;ed Father: For by the <HI>Mo|re&s;co</HI>
In&s;titutes, the Sons of Concu|bines
are equal Sharers in the Patrimo|ny
with tho&s;e of the lawful Wives. While
<HI>Re&s;hid</HI> made him&s;elf the comparative of
his Brother, he was lo&s;t into an Emu|lation,
that &s;purr'd him into the endea|vours
of promoting his Fortunes. He
&s;aw his own Condition, and that of Pub|lick
Affairs, qualified for no other Pro|po&s;al
to effect his de&s;ired Advancement,
but what was to be obtained by the
Sword: Whereupon he con&s;ulted with
his own <HI>Genius,</HI> by what Artifice he might
&s;oone&s;t imbroil <HI>Barbary</HI> in a new War,
and communicated the De&s;ign with &s;ome
few <HI>Moors</HI> of his own Complexion. At
the fir&s;t opening of his Adventure, his
Retinue exceeded not the number of
thirty, and tho&s;e of an inferior Quality,
who yet, by rea&s;on of the contracted|ne&s;s
of their Lots, were di&s;po&s;ed to ex|ecute
any Propo&s;ition that was probable
to enlarge them.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="36">
With this paucity of Adherents, <HI>Re|&s;hid</HI>
&s;ecretly withdrew from <HI>Tafilete</HI> to
<HI>Te&s;&s;a,</HI> a place abounding with Inhabi|tants,
but as poor as numerous. Here
<HI>Re&s;hid</HI> received the Royal Title of <HI>Mu|ley,</HI>
and was Proclaimed King of <HI>Tafilete.</HI>
And in acknowledgement and token of
his Royal Power, the People brought
him Pre&s;ents, as the known Pledges of
their Loyal &s;ubjection. This new <HI>Sul|tan</HI>
manife&s;ted a great di&s;dain of that A|varitious
humour, which had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
the minds of the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Princes,
much inveighing again&s;t the &s;ordid De|votion
of Sacrificing the Wealth of their
Subjects to them&s;elves. He therefore by
a &s;ubtil contrariety refu&s;ed to &s;hrine up
more Money in his Coffers, then might
decently defray Expences, leaving at the
fir&s;t that plea&s;ing bait to be devoured by
his Pro&s;elytes, whereby he purcha&s;ed a
great reinforcement of his Retinue. <HI>Te&s;|&s;a,</HI>
which he elected for his fir&s;t <HI>place</HI> of
<HI>Arms,</HI> &s;warm'd (as was &s;aid) with poor
Inhabitants, who&s;e Labors were too lit|tle
for their Su&s;tenance, which might ren|der
them the readier to take the Impre&s;|&s;ion
of any Coun&s;il that was likely to
<PB N="48" REF="37">
better their Condition. And <HI>Muley Re|&s;hid</HI>
is conceived to have repaired to this
beggerly Colony, to meet with an ea&s;ier
advance of Followers.</P>
<P>By rowling up and down, he had in
&s;hort time gathered &s;o great a Bulk, as
threatned an Inundation where&s;oever it
&s;hould &s;pread it &s;elf. Attended with this
numerous Rabble, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
to his Elder Brother <HI>Muley Hamet,</HI>
in a po&s;ture compounded of Ho&s;tility
and Friend&s;hip, of whom he demand|ed
the E&s;tate left him by his Father,
that he might be the better enabled to
perform &s;omething worthy of <HI>Their
Hou&s;e.</HI> The two Brothers began to wax
hot in the Conference; and it is &s;aid,
that the Language on both &s;ides was &s;o
exa&s;perating, that they had like to have
forgot the di&s;tance of their Condition,
and to have clo&s;ed up their Di&s;cour&s;e
with an unmannerly Combate. Both
were &s;o far tran&s;ported with Anger, that
without the lea&s;t overture of Reconcile|ment,
they fell into declared Ho&s;tility,
and left their private Quarrel to the
publick determination of a War.</P>
<P>In which <HI>Muley Re&s;hid</HI> was &s;o fortu|nate
<PB N="49" REF="37">
as to &s;lay his Brother, and thereby
was left without any to ju&s;tle him in the
Government of <HI>Dara.</HI> This &s;ucce&s;s did
&s;o &s;well <HI>Re&s;hid</HI>'s bo&s;ome, that le&s;s room
could not circum&s;cribe him then a King|dom.
The pre&s;ent Affairs of <HI>Barbary</HI>
were au&s;picious to his Enterpri&s;es: the
Countries being rent into petty Monar|chies,
every <HI>Almocaden</HI> that was able,
having put him&s;elf into a defen&s;ive Po|&s;ture,
aiming to live independent in his
Government. This divi&s;ion much faci|litated
<HI>Muley Re&s;hid</HI>'s De&s;igns: yet no|thing
was more conducing to his &s;ucce&s;s,
then his careful execution of Ju&s;tice, the
want whereof had been a general pre|tended
grievance; every detected Cri|minal
had condign puni&s;hment accord|ing
to demerit, whereby he became both
beloved and feared.</P>
<P>Together with his care for publick
Ju&s;tice, he continued his &s;eeming neg|lect
of Riches; &s;til dividing among his
<HI>Partizans</HI> the e&s;tates of tho&s;e whom their
own ob&s;tinacy made his &s;poils. But tho&s;e,
who gently yeilded to his mercy, he ge|nerou&s;ly
protected both in their Goods
and Per&s;ons. This obliging carryage
<PB N="50" REF="38">
gave wings to his <HI>Fame,</HI> and made him
where ever he came to be received with
acclamations; The common voice was
<HI>Illah Enzur Muley Re&s;hid, i.e.</HI> God ble&s;s
Prince <HI>Re&s;hid</HI> &amp; the vulgar e&s;teem'd him
&s;ent on purpo&s;e to cha&s;tize <HI>oppre&s;&s;ors.</HI></P>
<P>Having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of his
Brothers Territories, he advanced to|wards
<HI>Er&igrave;f</HI> govern'd by the <HI>Alcayd
Arras,</HI> who was his Brothers confede|rate,
and his Father-in-law, and who
in confidence of this relation (if we may
credit report) granted <HI>Muley Re&s;hid</HI> a
peaceable admi&s;&s;ion into his Dominions;
wherein for &s;ome Moons he deported
him&s;elf as a Son. But being a&s;certained
of the <HI>Alcayds</HI> intention to contract a
Friend&s;hip with <HI>Tanger,</HI> and that he had
di&s;patch'd an envoy to the &s;ame purpo&s;e
he concluded that he now wanted no
rea&s;on to declare him&s;elf an enemy to
the <HI>Alcayd's</HI> proceedings, and under this
pretext arm'd again&s;t him. The <HI>Alcayd</HI>
&s;eeing the <HI>X&eacute;riff</HI> attempting to di&s;poil
him of his Territories; and that con|trary
to all <HI>Ingenuity</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Ho|&s;pitality;</HI>
he began to u&s;urp the Country
of his Entertainer, he thought it high
<PB N="51" REF="38">
time to provide for his defence. There|fore
with &s;ome <HI>Extemporary Forces</HI> he
repaired to the <HI>Maritim Bo&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mma</HI> where
he reinforc'd a &s;mall Fort; not out of
any hopes to maintain it again&s;t the
<HI>X&eacute;riff,</HI> but thereby to have the advan|tage
of &s;urrendring it and him&s;elf upon
gentler Articles. <HI>Muley Re&s;hid</HI> advi&s;ed
of the <HI>Alcaids</HI> flight, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
to the pur&s;uit, and overtook him at the
mentioned Fortre&s;s. Which in few daies
the <HI>Alcayd</HI> delivered up to be demo|li&s;h'd
by the <HI>Xeriff,</HI> and him&s;elf his pri|&s;oner.</P>
<P>This Victory, or rather &s;urpri&s;al of
the <HI>Alcayd</HI> was a fair acce&s;&s;ion to <HI>Re|&s;hids</HI>
power, having now &s;ubjected the
only Potentate, whom the re&s;t of the
neighbouring Grandees had &s;o often
Courted for a Confederate.</P>
<P>Having thus obtained the command of
<HI>Er&igrave;f</HI> and the re&s;t of his <HI>Fatherinlaws</HI>
Country, it rai&s;ed in him no le&s;s a&s;pire|ing
hopes then to become <HI>Sultan</HI> of
<HI>Mauritania Tingitana,</HI> at that time rent
into parties. To the accompli&s;hing of
which de&s;ign he &s;aw the gaining of <HI>Fez</HI>
would contribute much to his e&s;teem,
<PB N="52" REF="39">
and give him admi&s;&s;ion into the heart of
the Kingdome. Upon this con&s;ideration
he re&s;olutely march'd to trye his for|tunes
with that ancient and famous Me|tropolis.
This City was lately in the
Government and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Cidi Ma|humed,</HI>
&s;econd Son to <HI>Ben Boucar,</HI> who
was de&s;poiled thereof, together with his
Life, by the cruelty of <HI>Ben&s;&aacute;llah, So|he&igrave;r,</HI>
and <HI>Dor&iacute;edi,</HI> &s;aid all to be <HI>Anda|luzian</HI>
Moors, and who had the Govern|ment
thereof divided among them, when
<HI>Re&s;hid</HI> came again&s;t it. The news of
who&s;e approach no &s;ooner reach'd <HI>Fez.</HI>
but the Governors, whom guilt had made
cowardly, betook them&s;elves to the
&s;tronge&s;t holds of the City, depo&s;iting
the Keys into &s;uch Hands, as they thought
fitte&s;t to be entru&s;ted with the protecti|on
of the Gates. <HI>Re&s;hid</HI> &s;eeing that <HI>Fez</HI>
was likely to co&s;t him dear, if he &s;tayed
to take it by a formal Siege, thought of
having recour&s;e to Stratagem; knowing
that he who a&s;pires after nothing but
Conque&s;t, ought not to binde him|&s;elf
to the Laws of a fair Game&s;ter.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;hid</HI> had &s;o long pre&s;&s;ed the City by
impeding their Markets, that he might
<PB N="53" REF="39">
rea&s;onably imagine there was a want of
provi&s;ion of Cattel; whereupon he re|&s;olved
to lodge &s;ome of his Forces near
the City Walls, and that him&s;elf, with
about &s;ixteen more, would drive &s;ome
Cattel to the Gates of <HI>Fez,</HI> under the
di&s;gui&s;e of Friends come to bring them
Provi&s;ion. This he put in execution in
the Night, and coming with the Cattel
to the Gates, with a Voice counterfeit|ing
ha&s;te and fear, they called to the
Guards for entrance, and de&s;ired that
they would take into their Protection
them and the booty brought for their
&s;uccour. Two were admitted to enter,
whereof the <HI>Xeriff</HI> is &s;aid to have been
one, who in&s;tantly &s;lew the Centinel, and
thereby made way for the re&s;t; who ha|ving
&s;ei&s;ed the Keys, &s;traight a&s;cended a
&s;mall Turret over the Gate, and thence
gave the Signal to his Forces, lodged near
for the purpo&s;e to advance: And the
&s;mall Gun that was placed in the Gate,
he cau&s;ed to be turned upon the City.
The Citizens being mi&s;erably confu&s;ed
and affrighted at the &s;uddenne&s;s of the
action, were not recovered of their Di|&s;tractions
till <HI>Re&s;hid</HI> poured in his Army
<PB N="54" REF="40">
among&s;t them; again&s;t whom being un|able
to make any con&s;iderable oppo&s;iti|on,
their la&s;t and only &s;uccour was a
timely &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which they perform|ed
with &s;uch humility, that <HI>Re&s;hid</HI> had
no temptation to reject it. After they
were received into protection, the <HI>Fez|ans</HI>
were not penurious in complaints a|gain&s;t
their Governors, imputing it to
their wilfull Pride, that the <HI>Xerif</HI> was
not received with &s;uch evidences of Ho|nor,
as they had always born to that Ti|tle.
But not &s;taying at &s;uch u&s;ele&s;s Com|plements,
<HI>Re&s;hid</HI> in the fir&s;t place took
into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the ancient Trea&s;ures
of the Kings of <HI>Fez.</HI> Next, he cau&s;ed
the three Governors to be brought be|fore
him, and having told them of their
great Oppre&s;&s;ions of the People, he com|manded
one of them to be burnt imme|diately,
another to be dragg'd about the

committed to cu&s;tody, and afterward is
&s;aid to have kill'd him with his own

unjustly with the People.</HI></P>
<P>And having thus &s;ubjected the famous

<HI>Ben-Boucar,</HI> whom without much re|&s;i&s;tance
he took Pri&s;oner, and brought
to <HI>Fez,</HI> and there granted him a liberal
Confinement, in token of that re&s;pect
which he bore his Piety and Age. After
this, he went again&s;t the <HI>Xerif</HI> of <HI>Ben|zaru&egrave;l,</HI>
who proved a very re&s;olute E|nemy,
for with the &s;trength of his own
<HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI> he found a Months work for all
<HI>Re&s;hids</HI> Army, but at length was forced
to render him&s;elf Pri&s;oner, and &s;till re|mains
in that Condition.</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;hid</HI> had now &s;o far advanced his
Dominion in the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> that
he had none therein to oppo&s;e him but
<HI>El Hader Ben Ali Gaylan;</HI> who for his
<HI>military Skill, per&s;onal Valour,</HI> and ma|ny
Years of <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> and <HI>Settlement</HI> in his
Government, rendred <HI>Tafilete</HI> dubious
in his Councils how to proceed again&s;t
him. <HI>Tafraught,</HI> a prodigious ridge of
Mountains, &s;o &s;ecured <HI>Gaylans</HI> Fronti|ers,
that no part was left pa&s;&s;able, but
what might ea&s;ily be guarded. And there|fore
to enter <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Dominions by o|pen
violence, <HI>Tafilete</HI> fore&s;aw would co&s;t
him the expen&s;e of more time then his
<PB N="56" REF="41">
Affairs could &s;pare: upon which refle|ction,
he fell to his &s;ucce&s;sful Art of ma|king
a fal&s;e Party in his Enemies Camp,
that he might obtain by <HI>intestine Trea|chery,</HI>
what in this ca&s;e he could not by
his own <HI>Force.</HI> To this end he &s;ecretly
enter'd into corre&s;pondence with <HI>Cidi
La&s;in El Phut,</HI> Governor of <HI>Benittar&ograve;s,
(Gaylans</HI> chief Frontier <HI>Cav&iacute;la)</HI> who was
entru&s;ted with the Avenue that let into
<HI>Gaylans</HI> Country. <HI>La&s;in</HI> was not much
indi&s;po&s;ed to a Revolt from <HI>Gaylan,</HI> be|ing
one of tho&s;e whom he had highly di&s;|plea&s;ed
in not calling them to the ad|jou&s;ting
of the la&s;t Peace with <HI>Tanger,</HI>
nor to partake of its Benefits (which
was very fatal to that juncture of <HI>Gay|lan</HI>'s
Affairs) and becau&s;e he &s;aw the
growing power of <HI>Tafilete,</HI> and that al|beit
for a while they might re&s;i&s;t him, yet
in time he would eat through their <HI>Alps.</HI>
Upon the&s;e Temptations, or what other,
we may imagine operative upon the <HI>wa|ry,
covetous, a&s;piring</HI> and <HI>revengeful</HI> na|ture
of a <HI>Moor, La&s;in</HI> contracted with
<HI>Tafilete, Re&s;hid,</HI> or the <HI>Xeriff</HI> (which in

<PB N="57" REF="41">
attach the Pa&s;&s;age, who to that end had
always a &s;elect Band in readine&s;s. And
when by his own Example <HI>La&s;in</HI> had
taught the Guards to be remi&s;s, and had
got the advantage of <HI>Gaylans</HI> ab&s;ence, he
gave <HI>Tafilete</HI> the Signal, who gain'd the
Pa&s;&s;age, and with &s;uch &s;uddenne&s;s &s;et
upon the Re&s;erves, that they were not
able to make any con&s;iderable re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The news of this Di&s;a&s;ter &s;oon reacht
<HI>Alcazar,</HI> where <HI>Gaylan</HI> was entertaining
him&s;elf with his Relation <HI>Cogez,</HI> who
with &s;ome of his be&s;t Troops march'd to
the &s;uccour of his other Forces, which
otherwi&s;e had been totally de&s;troyed.
<HI>Gaylan</HI> in this Encounter gave great te|&s;timonies
of his Valour, and had, no

At la&s;t, finding him&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed

</LETTER>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Lieutenant Governor
had peru&s;ed the Letter, he re&s;olved to
gratifie <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s de&s;ires, as being glad of
an opportunity to vindicate the <HI>honour</HI>
of the <HI>Engli&s;h Nation</HI> from &s;ome impu|tations,
which <HI>Gaylan</HI> objected to the
Lieutenant Governor (when he was with
<PB N="60" REF="43">
him at <HI>Arzila)</HI> and which was chiefly oc|ca&s;ioned
through &s;ome mi&s;take between
the Great <HI>Tiveot</HI> and <HI>Gaylan,</HI> concerning
the time when the War &s;hould commence
in the Year 1663. For albeit the Earl
of <HI>Tiveot</HI> had &s;ufficiently cleared the Ho|nor
and Ju&s;tice of that Action, yet <HI>Gay|lan</HI>
&s;eeming not &s;o to apprehend it, the
Lieutenant Governor was glad of an oc|ca&s;ion
to let him know, That it was the
mind of his Ma&s;ter, the King of <HI>Great
Brittain,</HI> that all his Mini&s;ters &s;hould be
punctual in the ob&s;ervation of what they
&s;tipulated in his Name. To which end,
in a generous and well-compo&s;ed Let|ter,
the Lieuteuant Governor condoled
<HI>Gaylan</HI>'s mi&s;-fortune, a&s;&s;uring him of his
Friend&s;hip, and that he would exactly
comply with every Article of the Peace
concluded betwixt <HI>Tanger</HI> and his Ex|cellency;
and that if any of his Va&s;&s;als,
Allies, or Dome&s;tiques, &s;hould in any
Exigence make <HI>Tanger</HI> their Sanctuary,
they &s;hould find it no otherwi&s;e, and that
they &s;hould be treated according to their
Quality and Condition. This Letter
was &s;ent by a Kin&s;man of the Lieutenant
Governors, who according to directions,
<PB N="61" REF="43">
confirm'd <HI>Gaylan</HI> in the belief of meet|ing
with all the &s;uccors that he could
rea&s;onably expect from the lately con|tracted
Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>This Me&s;&s;age, who&s;e kindne&s;s was
doubled by its &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s and &s;peed,
put new Spirits into <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s drooping
Concerns, and gave him Courage to
&s;ound the temper of his revolted <HI>Cav&iacute;|la</HI>'s,
which he found well di&s;po&s;ed to
his Service, albeit they were forced to
di&s;&s;emble their Intentions till their Har|ve&s;t
was &s;ecured, lea&s;t otherwi&s;e they
&s;hould &s;econd the War with a Dearth&punc;
for &s;o little is the Provi&s;ion of the
<HI>Moors,</HI> that the lo&s;s or mi&s;carriage of
one Crop, brings a Famine.</P>
<P>But while <HI>Gaylan</HI> was laboring to re|tard,
<HI>Tafilete</HI> was improving his la&s;t Vi|ctory:
and having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of
the Pa&s;&s;age into his Enemies Territo|ries,
he quickly became Ma&s;ter of <HI>Alca|z&agrave;r,</HI>
the chiefe&s;t of <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Inland
Towns, which was de&s;erted by <HI>Cidi Ha|met
Cog&egrave;z,</HI> who for many Years had go|vern'd
there by the Title of <HI>Alcayde.</HI>
The tydings of the <HI>Xerifs</HI> Succe&s;&s;es no
&s;ooner reach'd <HI>Tituan,</HI> but that Town
<PB N="62" REF="44">
declared for him, and with their be&s;t
Solemnity Proclaimed him King. At the
&s;ame time the <HI>Shat</HI> of <HI>Angera,</HI> a prin|cipal
Per&s;on in tho&s;e parts, nearly re|lated
to <HI>Gaylan</HI> by Blood and Marriage,
retired to the Woods in the Bay of that
<HI>Alcaz&agrave;r,</HI> which &s;tands upon the Midland
Sea; where he re&s;olved to conceal him|&s;elf,
whil'&s;t he &s;ent his Dome&s;tiques to
<HI>Ceuta,</HI> a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garri&s;on, and <HI>Tanger,</HI>
to procure <HI>Segur&ograve;s</HI> for him&s;elf and Fa|mily,
in ca&s;e the <HI>Xerif</HI> &s;hould prove im|placable,
and refu&s;e to receive him un|to
fair Quarters.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Shat</HI> of <HI>Angera</HI> tired with his
retreat, and cheri&s;hing &s;ome dull hopes
of <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Recovery, &s;ent in a Bille<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to the Lieutenant Governor of <HI>Tanger</HI>
in <HI>More&s;co,</HI> in which he &s;eemed to in&s;i|nuate,
that he intended no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
to the <HI>Xerif,</HI> which was Tran&s;lated thus.</P>
<P>The Letter of <HI>Alm&oacute;cadem Ca&s;um Shat,</HI>
and his Sons <HI>Alm&oacute;cadem, Abdelcr&igrave;m,</HI> and
<HI>Alm&oacute;cadem Ali,</HI> to the Captain of <HI>Tan|ger,</HI>
whom we honor much. De&s;iring that
he would do them the favour to &s;end them
four Kintals of Powder, four hundred
<PB N="63" REF="44">
Balls, and a Kintal of Lead, with fifty or
more Muskets: and that if the Captain
have any need of Wood or Barley, they will
repay him in that Commodity: This they
&s;ollicit as <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s faithful Friends.</P>
<P>I have in&s;erted this Letter for the &s;ake
of its &s;tile, being the fir&s;t and only Ad|dre&s;s
made in this manner to any of the
Engli&s;h Governors in <HI>Tanger.</HI> But how
hopeful &s;oever the <HI>Shats</HI> Affairs might
appear at the date of this Letter, yet
very &s;hortly after they &s;eem'd to be in
a very langui&s;hing &s;tate, as was ea&s;ily
to be collected by a large account there|of
given to <HI>Cidi Hamet Alg&iacute;lo,</HI> who was
then in <HI>Tanger,</HI> and which is here tran&s;|lated
out of <HI>Arabique</HI> thus.</P>
<P>The Letter of <HI>Taliffo Hamet El Shat,</HI>
which is bid to &s;alute <HI>Hamet Alg&iacute;lo,</HI> and
to give him an account of the Troubles that
have happened here; how that the &s;ame
Night that <HI>Taliffo Hamet El Shat</HI> left
<HI>Angera,</HI> he came into the Fields of <HI>Tan|ger,</HI>
where he killed two Men, and took
away their Goods; and returning to the
<HI>Ald&eacute;a</HI> (or Village) he found not one Per|&s;on
<PB N="64" REF="45">
at his Hou&s;e, neither Man nor Woman,
except <HI>Ali El Hag</HI> in the Hou&s;e of our &V;n|cle
<HI>Abdelcrim:</HI> all our Kinred were fled
to <HI>Ceuta.</HI> But coming to &s;peak with the
People of <HI>Angera,</HI> they de&s;ired us for the
love of God to leave them, whereupon they
al&s;o fled to <HI>Ceuta:</HI> He that did this was
<HI>Ben-Hal&oacute;o.</HI> I thereupon writ a Letter
to the King, to de&s;ire to have pity upon us.
I writ al&s;o to <HI>Almocadem Hamet Ben-L&eacute;efi,</HI>
and now write again for the Kings
An&s;wer, and according to it I &s;hall advi&s;e
both them and thee. Have thou patience,
and within two or three days the An&s;wer
will be come. Moreover, I let thee know,
that we are guarding our Hou&s;es from fire
and mi&s;chief, having every Night twenty
upon the Guard. I endeavour to keep up
my Peoples courage. Know moreover, that
the King hath given to <HI>Abdelh&aacute;der Alfif|toah,</HI>
the Government of <HI>Angera,</HI> but the
People will not receive him, but have writ
to the King about it, though as yet they
have no an&s;wer. Lastly, I give thee to
understand, That the King hath burned
the Village of <HI>Benigerfut,</HI> and taken a|way
their Goods.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="45">
So various was <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Fortunes,
that while at one place he &s;eem'd de&s;pe|rate,
in another he was victorious, and
notwith&s;tanding that at <HI>Angera Taffilete</HI>
was a Conquerour, as his letter inti|mates,
at <HI>Arzila</HI> he was &s;ubdued; for
from thence <HI>Gaylan</HI> a&s;&s;ured his Confe|derates
that all his <HI>Cav&iacute;las</HI> were re|turn'd
to their Obedience, that they had
ma&s;&s;acred tho&s;e <HI>Tafilete</HI> had left to keep
them in awe, and &s;hut him in between
two rocky mountains; and that him|&s;elf
was ha&s;tening thither to &s;ee his e|nemy
and act his Cata&s;trophe, and to
put a period to the war. At the &s;ame
time he gave out that <HI>Titu&agrave;n</HI> was peni|tent
for their Revolt, and weary of the
<HI>Xerifs</HI> exactions, and were ready to joyn
with him to effect the utter overthrow
of that Imperious Invader.</P>
<P>Yet what face &s;oever <HI>Gaylan</HI> put up|on
his condition, it was certain that
<HI>Taffilete</HI> dayly advanced his conque&s;t,
and at the &s;ame time when his ene|my
thus confidently reported his di|&s;tre&s;s;
he was in a flouri&s;hing condition,
for the <HI>Xerif</HI> had then routed all <HI>Gay|lan</HI>'s
fre&s;h recruits, and in dete&s;tation
<PB N="66" REF="46">
of him had taken up the bones of his Fa|ther
and burn'd them, &s;aying, <HI>That he
de&s;erved no better, who was the root
of that bramble, which had &s;o long ty|rannically
rent and torn the poor.</HI></P>
<P>He had al&s;o taken Pri&s;oners &s;ome of
<HI>Gaylan's</HI> neare&s;t relations, and &s;ent them
to <HI>Fez,</HI> and committed great &s;poiles up|on
their goods, whom he found ab&s;ent
from their habitations, and had brought
a con&s;iderable wing within a league of
<HI>Arzila,</HI> where if he had &s;tay'd to &s;treigh|ten
it, want of bread within a few moons
would have con&s;train'd them to &s;urren|der.</P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Titu&agrave;n</HI> was at this time
likewi&s;e &s;o far from re&s;uming <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s
Intere&s;t, that all things there &s;eem'd &s;et|led

&s;o &s;teddily, that the continuance of
his Friend&s;hip could not be &s;u&s;pected
by the one, nor want of di&s;po&s;ition to
contract a new one by the other. <HI>Ta|filete</HI>
could not &s;o much e&s;teem him
his enemy as <HI>Gaylan's Freind;</HI> and his fi|delity
to a <HI>distre&s;&s;ed Confederate</HI> removed
all &s;u&s;picion of being otherwi&s;e to a
<HI>pro&s;perous.</HI> And by this wi&s;e manage|ment
he clear'd up tho&s;e &s;cruples, which
through &s;ome mi&s;happrehen&s;ions of for|mer
proceedings (of the Earle of <HI>Tiveot</HI>

litle to return to <HI>Gaylan,</HI> who had by this
&s;o long contemned the condition of his

an ambiguous intimation of his Enemies

of his own. And however he labour'd
to beget or pre&s;erve his freinds hopes
of his Re&s;tauration, yet it could not
take with tho&s;e who &s;aw <HI>Taffilete</HI>

of <HI>the inte&s;tine</HI> Broyles, wherewith it

But in this e&s;pecially, that there remaines

us with what hath pa&s;s'd, except ru|ines
and deva&s;tations, the Genuine memories
of a De&s;olating war. For to demand of a

or an account of the Traver&s;es that

and thereby affront his adored lite|rature.</P>
<P>Now the likelie&s;t rea&s;on, that can be ren|der'd
of this ignorance, is the neglect of pre|&s;erving
Records of their Tran&s;actions, for

an Account in the foregoing Narrative.
And therefore without the &s;olemnity of any

Narration of the pre&s;ent cu&s;toms of Barbary
in the &s;ucceeding Chapters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The &s;oile, productions, Commodities,

<P><HI>LEo Afer</HI> delivers two Etymologies,
which are &s;o agreable both to the
nature of the <HI>Language,</HI> and Glebe of the
Country, that they may &s;eem to have
bin impo&s;ed by <HI>Adam,</HI> the Primitive No|menclator.
For if we li&s;ten to the Moors
language, <HI>Barbary</HI> &s;eems to be de&s;cended
from <HI>Barbar,</HI> which &s;ignifies an inarti|culate
murmur and grumbling noi&s;e
without accent or harmony, for their
&s;peech is har&s;h, being very guttural:
which is e&s;teemed an argument of its
Antiquity. And indeed it hath gain'd
the vogue of no le&s;s antient a pedigree,
than to be bred of the old <HI>Punic</HI> and <HI>A|rabian.</HI></P>
<P>Another rea&s;on why this Country bears
the name of <HI>Barbary,</HI> may be taken from
the frame and di&s;po&s;ition of the Earth,
which being full of wild and unkindly
<PB N="76" REF="51">
Tumours, well challengeth the name of
<HI>Bar</HI> (a Word not known to the pre|&s;ent
Inhabitants) &s;ignifying a De&s;art,
and the duplicate of the Mono&s;yllable
<HI>Bar-Bar</HI> implyeth that of old, <HI>Bar|bary</HI>
was nothing but a great Solitude.
And for this derivation, <HI>Leo Afer</HI> tells
this Story: King <HI>Iphycus</HI> being driven
out of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> fled into <HI>Aegypt,</HI>
where finding him&s;elf much pre&s;&s;ed by
his Enemies, and dubious what cour&s;e
to run for his &s;afety, he asked his Ad|herents
what they thought was the mo&s;t
probable way to &s;ecure them&s;elves;
whereupon they all, with an unexpect|ed
con&s;ent an&s;wered <HI>Barbar,</HI> meaning
thereby that the hopefulle&s;t method of
Protection was to pa&s;s over <HI>Nilus</HI> into
the De&s;arts of <HI>Africa.</HI> And finding
this Etymologie to bear &s;o fair a Pro|portion
with the Complexion and Sur|face
of the Land, I &s;hall not &s;cruple the
occa&s;ion of its Impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>But when we look from the outward
&s;hape, to the Productions of the Coun|trey,
we &s;ee the uncomeline&s;s thereof
recompen&s;ed in the Fertility, which for|bids
us to judge of Internal Dowries by
<PB N="77" REF="51">
the outward Model: Providence u&s;ual|ly
&s;upplying the defects of the Body
with the abilities of the Mind, it being
the fate of many excellent Parts, like
<HI>Galba</HI>'s, to be ill lodged. The Anci|ents
accounted Wood and Grain, the
more natural and u&s;eful I&s;&s;ues of a Coun|trey,
as having a more immediate ten|dency
to &s;upply Mankind with the
greater Nece&s;&s;ities of Lodging and Diet.
But in this Canton of <HI>Barbary,</HI> the
Woods are &s;carce and mean, and fitter
to warm the Hou&s;e then build it. For
ranging their Groves, I found them con|&s;i&s;t
chiefly of Cork-Trees, which &s;eem'd
to differ but little from the Scarlet-Oak,
excepting the indenture of their Leaves.
Their Fruit is a &s;maller kind of Acorn,
woody within: At the Root of the&s;e
Trees is u&s;ually found the <HI>Lenti&s;co,</HI>
which is generally but a &s;hrub, and of
little other &s;ervice to the <HI>Moors</HI> then to
feed their Goats. The Juice whereof,
mingled with other Ingredients, is u&s;ed
by the Potters to give a faint colour to
their Earthen-ware, which they find to
enhaun&s;e the price, and advance the
&s;ale.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="52">
The next remarkable &s;ort of Wood is
the <HI>Alcar&oacute;be,</HI> a Tree of great Curio&s;ity,
and meriting a larger Note. The <HI>Alcar&oacute;be</HI>
bears a Cod, in quantity&punc; and likene&s;s
much re&s;embling the Engli&s;h Bean; the
inner &s;ub&s;tance thereof is &s;weet, and
lodgeth hard &s;mall Kernels. This Fruit
is eat by the <HI>Moors</HI> of inferior Condi|tion,
and by all at the Fea&s;t <HI>A&s;hor&agrave;h:</HI>
but it is chiefly pre&s;erved for their Hor|&s;es,
to whom it is both Phy&s;ick and re|pa&s;t.
For as a <HI>Moor,</HI> well skill'd in that
Animal, told me, the Fruit of the <HI>Al|car&oacute;be</HI>
hath two excellent Properties, to
Drench, and make their Hor&s;es Fat.</P>
<P>Some have called the Fruit <HI>Locusta,</HI>
and &s;uppo&s;ed that it was the <HI>Baptists</HI>
Food in the Wilderne&s;s: But others con|jecture
that St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s <GAP DESC="foreign">, were
only the tops and extremities of Herbs
and Plants. And there are al&s;o &s;ome
judicious Criticks, who interpret the
<HI>Baptist</HI>'s Locu&s;ts to be a kind of Fly or
Gra&s;hopper, w^c^h in warmer Climates are
very large and many, and were former|ly
dryed and eaten by the Inhabitants.
But they were ob&s;erved to yield but
&s;mall Nutriment, and ever thought fitter
<PB N="79" REF="52">
for Medicine than Alimony. I was told
(but by a Travailer) that in <HI>Aegypt</HI>
the&s;e flyes come in &s;uch clouds, that
they darken the sky where they ap|pear,
and that in a &s;hort &s;pace they con|&s;ume
the fruits of the Earth where they
are permitted to fall. To prevent which
mi&s;chief (he told me that) the people
ob&s;erving the &s;ea&s;on of their coming,
prepare again&s;t them, and keeping them
from &s;etling by di&s;charging Gunns into
the aire where they are di&s;cover'd. That
the&s;e locu&s;ts and Gra&s;hoppers were ea|ten
by the Barbarous Nations, may be
concluded from the Law that made them
forbidden meat to the Jews, <HI>Levit.</HI> 11.
22.</P>
<P>But to leave the Moor to this &s;ort of
flys, whereof he hath no &s;carcity, there
is a greater probability that the fruit
of the <HI>Alcar&ograve;be</HI> is the &s;ame with the Pro|digal's
<HI>Ceratia,</HI> or husks; for it doth ex|cellently
accord with their de&s;cription
&s;et down by that great intelligence of
Divinity in his Note. <HI>B. S. Luke.</HI> XI.</P>
<P>In &s;ome parts of this Countrey there
is great plenty of white Mulberry trees,
nouri&s;hed on purpo&s;e to feed the &s;ilk|worm,
<PB N="80" REF="53">
a creature that doth afford the
curious many delightful &s;peculations;
but the Moor regards it only for its e|molument.
The &s;ea&s;on of the worm be|ing
pa&s;&s;ed, they feed their Cattel with
the re&s;idue of the Mulberry leaves.</P>
<P>The Towns of Commerce, and Con|ver&s;ation,
have plea&s;ant Orchards of
Orange, Lemons and Limes, with Gar|dens
yielding plenty and variety of &s;al|lad.
And that which maketh their Gar|dens
both profitable and delightful is,
that they are always fruitful and re|tain
a refre&s;hing verdure. And this they
effect by keeping the &s;oyle con&s;tantly in
a temperate moi&s;ture: for the water-cour&s;es
are &s;o providently contriv'd
that every Garden receiv's it in due pro|portion,
and at a certain hour; which
running among the little trenches, af|fords
a very equal and fertile irriga|tion.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Sallad ordinary in other
Countreys, they have one &s;ort rarely to
be met with in Europe, which they call
by a word, &s;ounding &s;pani&s;h <HI>Tom&aacute;tos.</HI>
This growes in the common fields, and
when ripe is pluckt and eaten with oyle&punc;
<PB N="91" REF="53">
it is plea&s;ant but apt to cloy. <HI>Bareng&eacute;|nas,</HI>
as in <HI>Spain,</HI> grow creeping like Cu|cumers
upon the Ground; The&s;e are
boyled with Beef and Mutton, and of no
vulgar e&s;timation among the Moors.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Cav&iacute;las</HI> (a divi&s;ion in the Coun|trey
that much re&s;embles that of Coun|ties
in <HI>England)</HI> have large and fruitful
Vineyards, and the bloud of the Grape,
though it be utterly prohibited them by
<HI>Mahumed</HI> their Prophet, yet of late
through the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the times,
it is liberally quaff'd by many of the
Moors. But that they might not herein
give offence to the weaker <HI>Mu&s;ul-men,</HI>
nor betray any contempt of the law, they
are generally cautious in this liberty,
and u&s;e it, as we &s;ay, <HI>&V;nder the Ro&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Plants of this Country are very ob|&s;ervable
for their variety and &s;trange|ne&s;s,
for many are to be found in <HI>Bar|bary,</HI>
which cannot be met with in cold|er
Climes. And &s;ome, which are u&s;ual
in other Countreys, are in this found to
differ much from their de&s;criptions in
Common Herbals.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>D.</HI> H. W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> This I learned from

immortality, and immature death had
not depriv'd the world of that profitable
endeavour.</P>
<P>The Grain in this, differs not from
that in other Countreys, excepting that
here are two &s;orts of Grain, &s;carce well
known in other parts of the world, The
one they call <HI>Pharo&ugrave;k,</HI> which is of a le&s;|&s;er
&s;ize, hungry and cour&s;e, much re|&s;embling,
if not altogether the &s;ame,
with the Spani&s;h <HI>Panizo,</HI> and it is only
the more beggarly Moors that u&s;e this
for bread. The other is known among
them by the name of <HI>Tourki&aacute;,</HI> which is
a larger body than the former, and yields
good flower, whereof bread is made
for the Nobles of the Land. And as the
Barley and Beans are reapt in April,
the wheat in May and June, &s;o is Sep|tember
the u&s;ual &s;ea&s;on for gathering
the other kinds of bread-corn.</P>
<P>The rains are to the Moors, what the
Nile&s;cope is &s;aid to be to the <HI>Aegyptians,</HI>
for according to their plenty or &s;carce|ne&s;s,
they are able to foretell the dearth
and plenty of the year. But there is a
<PB N="93" REF="54">
&s;ort of Religioni&s;ts among them, who
mea&s;ure the products of the earth by the
&s;ins of its Inhabitants, and who divine
of the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of their tillage from the
Ob&s;ervation of their <HI>Ramadan</HI> (or
Lent) and the due celebrating of their
[Ea&s;ter] <HI>H&igrave;d Segu&egrave;r,</HI> or the little fea&s;t
that concludes it.</P>
<P>If the clouds are &s;paring in &s;howers at
<HI>Seed-time,</HI> and Earing, the crop is lit|tle
lean; and in their be&s;t Harve&s;ts,
they &s;eldom reap more than will bring
about the year, &s;o that the failure of
one Crop brings an inevitable dearth
upon the land. The Moors are very ob&s;er|ving
of the <HI>Trade-rains,</HI> (for &s;o they may
not improperly be termed, as never fal|ling
but at &s;uch a time) The former Rain
is call'd by a word importing Ble&s;&s;ing,
and the latter <HI>[Na&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n]</HI> or <HI>Holy-water,</HI>
of which names I could meet with no o|ther
Rationale but Tradition.</P>
<P>There appeares but little indu&s;try in
the Moors husbandry, for their tillage
is &s;o mean, that he that &s;ees it may ju&s;t|ly
wonder, that the Land under &s;uch
&s;mall improvement &s;hould be &s;o fruit|ful.
In mo&s;t parts they plough but with
<PB N="94" REF="55">
two Oxen, carele&s;ly tyed by the horns,
and in &s;ome <HI>Cav&iacute;las</HI> with a like number
of A&s;&s;es, Mules, Camels, and a ba&s;er
breed of Hor&s;es. The plough turns up
no more mold, than &s;ufficeth to bury
the &s;eed: for (&s;ay they) if the fur|rows
&s;hould be deep, and the drought
begin, er'e that the corn hath broken the
Earth, it would not be able to force a
pa&s;&s;age through the &s;tifned clods. They
u&s;e no labour to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Arbale</HI> by ma|nuring
it, except that the Ordure of
their Towns is ca&s;t out, not &s;o much to
enrich the Glebe, as to keep them&s;elves
cleanly. But this painful part of hu&s;|bandry
is &s;upplyed by the Anniver&s;ary
burning of the withered gra&s;s and &s;tu|ble,
which &s;ervs to help the &s;oyle, and
de&s;troy the Vermin, which otherwi&s;e,
e&s;pecially the Scorpion, would render
the Countrey very dangerous for habi|tation.</P>
<P>When the Moors have reapt their corn,
they tread it out with Oxen, Camels, &amp;c,
&amp; winnow it upon the place where it
grows, and then &s;et the chaff on fire; In
which particulars they are an excellent
Comment upon the like, reflected upon
<PB N="95" REF="55">
in <HI>Sacred Writ.</HI> In&s;tead of Granaries,
they have Caves brick'd or wrought with
&s;tone, call'd <HI>Matam&oacute;ras,</HI> in which they
repo&s;ite their Corn, where it is pre&s;erv'd
from the Worm, and other Enemies.
The Straw they chop and keep for their
H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r&s;es, for although there be abundance
of Herbage, yet no part thereof is cured
and pre&s;erved for a Winter &s;tore of Hay,
which I impute to the <HI>Moors</HI> &s;loth, ra|ther
than the needle&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch a Pro|vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>After I had taken this Survey of what
appeared upon the Earth by Nature, or
its Improver, Husbandry, I found &s;uf|ficient
In&s;tigations, both by Curio&s;ity
and Rea&s;on, to dive into its Entrals,
which I have been told are in many pla|ces
as rich as the be&s;t Oars can make
them. And of this Truth there have
appeared large Specimens, about <HI>Tituan,
Alcaz&agrave;r, Gheb&egrave;r, &amp;c.</HI> And the rea&s;on

a Temptation, may be charg'd upon

<P>THe Survey now pa&s;&s;eth one Stair

Creatures, whereof <HI>Barbary</HI> has no le&s;s
plenty, than of Gra&s;s to maintain them,
but looking into their Flocks and Herds,
I found the latter more numerous, yet
not to that quantity as report inform'd
me. And enquiring why the <HI>Moors</HI> were
more for the Stall, than the Fold; they
replyed, That Cows yielded them more
con&s;tant relief than Sheep, and were
more ready to furni&s;h out both their Ta|bles
<PB N="97" REF="56">
and Pur&s;es. Their Hor&s;es are both
few and mean, and for the mo&s;t part
much inferiour to tho&s;e of other Nati|ons,
which at fir&s;t created my wonder,
becau&s;e of the great repute the <HI>Barbary</HI>
Hor&s;es had obtain'd in mo&s;t <HI>European</HI>
Countries. But they have a peculiar
Ca&s;t of Barbs able to maintain this Re|nown,
which the <HI>Moors</HI> carefully pre|&s;erve,
never imploying them in low and
ba&s;e Offices, but keep them only for the
Saddle and Military Service. And to the
great ea&s;e of their Hor&s;es, the <HI>Moors</HI>
have &s;tore of Camels for their &s;ore&s;t
Drudgeries. Now the Camel is a Crea|ture
of &s;trange Bulk and humour, who&s;e
Diet is mean and incredibly little, for
they will Travel great Journeys under
heavy Loads, without further allowance
than the tops of Thi&s;tles, or any mean
Herbage. Nor are they le&s;s ab&s;temious
in their Bevarage, than Meat; being &s;o
patient of Thir&s;t, that they will Travel
four days without touching Water, and
then at one Drinking take in as much as

<P>There is a Pre&s;umption, that the Ca|mels

much enquired after the manner of the
Camels Copulation, but could meet

of Bea&s;ts that are called Wild: Lions,
Leopards, Wolves, Foxes, <HI>&amp;c</HI> with
great plenty of Jackals, &s;o much famed
for Catoring for the Lyon: They u&s;u|ally
hunt in Packs, opening with a &s;hril
yelping noi&s;e, and are de&s;cribed to be
Mungrel Creatures, of an equivocal
Generation, deriving rapaciou&s;ne&s;s from
the Wolf their Sire, and cunning from
the Fox their Dam; they are very ra|venous,
eating Carrion, digging up dead
Bodies, and will feed upon that which a
genuine Fox will not daign to ta&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="58">
Wild Boars are no rarity in this <HI>Dio|ce&s;s,</HI>
which the <HI>Moors</HI> hunt and kill in a

to the Trencher, becau&s;e all

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Divi&s;ion of the Inhabitants,
different manner of living, their
Genius, their entertainment of
Foreign Mini&s;ters.</HEAD>
<P>THe Family of <HI>Noah</HI> (&s;aith the Jewi&s;h
Antiquary <HI>Flav. Jo&s;eph.)</HI> being
jealous of a &s;econd Deluge, dur&s;t not
de&s;cend to Cultivate the Plains, but
dwelt upon the talle&s;t Mountains: till
at length, <HI>Sem</HI> ventured to Inhabit the
Valleys; where they lived in a Clu&s;ter,
and &s;eemed &s;u&s;picious of the Divine
Command, bidding them <HI>di&s;per&s;e and
over-&s;pread the Earth:</HI> fearing that this
might be a De&s;ign to &s;catter them that
they might the more ea&s;ily be de&s;troyed,
for which rea&s;on they long time kept to|gether
in a clo&s;e Neighborhood. Out
of which &s;tory nothing is needful here
to be collected, but that Mountains have
ever proved the Refuges of the Di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed,
and the People that Inhabited them
<PB N="102" REF="59">
valued for their Antiquity above the re&s;t
of the Land. Of which truth, <HI>Barba|ry</HI>
yields a pregnant in&s;tance in the divi|&s;ion
of her Inhabitants, of which there
are two &s;orts known among them, by the
u&s;ual Names of <HI>Al&aacute;rbes</HI> and <HI>Barab&aacute;rs.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Al&aacute;rbes</HI> are u&s;ually by the <HI>Euro|peans</HI>
&s;til'd Mountaineers, from the place
of their greate&s;t re&s;idence. And the&s;e
think them&s;elves the Elder Natives, and
therefore of the better Hou&s;e. They
are not altogether &s;o Civiliz'd as the o|ther,
but live more rudely and rovingly,
&s;hifting from Mountain to Mountain ac|cording
to their Exigences, never con|fining
their rambling humors to any &s;et|led
Man&s;ion. They live in Haimas or
Tents, made of a cour&s;e browni&s;h Cloth,
which the Women work and weave of the
Bark of Palmito's mingled with Goats
hair; and the&s;e Itinerary Habitations
they remove from one place to another,
in obedience to their fickle Humors and
cogent Nece&s;&s;ities. Robbery is their
Ma&s;ter-piece and be&s;t Livelyhood; and
in this E&s;tate they much glory, as coming
&s;o near the condition of <HI>Muley Mahu|m&eacute;ds</HI>
fir&s;t Votaries. About an Age pa&s;t
<PB N="103" REF="59">
they were very numerous, but the late
Civil Wars have made great abatements
of their Mu&s;ters.</P>
<P>The other &s;ort of <HI>Moors</HI> are vulgarly
called <HI>Barab&agrave;rs,</HI> but by a Dialect <HI>Br&eacute;|bers:</HI>
The&s;e have fixed Dwellings, and
live in Neighborhood; and finding Con|ver&s;ation
to be u&s;eful and &s;afe, affording
Comfort and Profit, they are combin'd
into <HI>Ald&eacute;a</HI>'s, or Villages, where their
Cottages are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, that there is
not any con&s;iderable di&s;proportion a|mong
them in re&s;pect of their di&s;tance
from the <HI>Giemma,</HI> or Church.</P>
<P>Over the&s;e <HI>Barab&agrave;rs</HI> are Subordinate
Governors or <HI>Almocadens,</HI> to whom
they pay a dutiful Ob&s;ervance. Their
Vocation is Tillage and Grazing; and
live much after the condition of the <HI>La|barad&oacute;res</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> the Pai&s;ants in
<HI>France,</HI> and the Boors in <HI>Flanders.</HI> The
<HI>Barab&agrave;rs</HI> of late are grown more nume|rous
than the <HI>Al&aacute;rbes,</HI> and for &s;everal
Years have inhabited both the Moun|tains
and Campaigns. But albeit they
have taken the Hills from the <HI>Al&aacute;rbes,</HI>
yet they have left them the reproach of
Robbery, though they them&s;elves are no
Novices in that My&s;tery.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="60">
But notwith&s;tanding their different
Mode of living, they unite in the gene|ral
Character of Body and Humour: For
they are all of a large Stature, &s;trong
Con&s;titution, &s;tately Carriage, and dif|fering
in Complexion according to their
conver&s;ing with the Sun and Air. Tho&s;e
whom for di&s;tinction I mu&s;t call the
Gentry, are according to their Rules of
Chivalry well skill'd in managing of the
Hor&s;e, and dextrous at the Lance, for
they &s;corn all toyl that is not Military,
and account no Employment &s;o noble as
that of a Souldier. They agree like|wi&s;e
in Humour, for both are Jealous
and Revengeful. Their Jealou&s;ie is pal|pable
in their Carriage towards their
Wives, whom they keep in great Subje|ction
and Retirement, which makes A|dultery
a Stranger to their Beds: Nor
can it rea&s;onably be otherwi&s;e, &s;eeing
that the Wife is fully a&s;&s;ur'd that the ve|ry
attempt to pilfer a Plea&s;ure, if di&s;|cover'd,
will co&s;t her her Life. They
are likewi&s;e implacable in their hatred,
and impatient till they have avenged an
Injury; for they are taught by their Pro|phet,
<HI>That Revenge is a Virtue.</HI> But
<PB N="105" REF="60">
leaving the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions to the ju&s;tification
of the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Law and Cu&s;toms, the
<HI>Moors</HI> are guilty of a cen&s;orious Su&s;pi|cion
towards Strangers, which hath no
colour to be excu&s;ed. This I fir&s;t ob|&s;erved
in their carriage toward <HI>Don Die|go
de Palma,</HI> a Cavalier of the Habit of
St. <HI>James,</HI> who being &s;ent to Comple|ment
<HI>Gaylan</HI> from his <HI>Catholick Majesty,</HI>
and chanceing to &s;mile at the <HI>Moors</HI> De|portment,
as not an&s;wering the &s;tarch'd|ne&s;s
of his own Nation; the <HI>Moors,</HI> who
were very circum&s;pect in ob&s;erving eve|ry
tittle of the <HI>Don</HI>'s Deportment, were
&s;o &s;agacious as to find in this ca&s;ual Smile
a deri&s;ion of their Court&s;hip, which they
left not unrevenged in intrigueing his
Errand. Now it is ob&s;ervable, that the
<HI>Moors</HI> are very moro&s;e and ab&s;temious
in point of Laughter, e&s;teeming tho&s;e
who are much thereunto addicted, to be
&s;cornful and fooli&s;h.</P>
<P>And now having promi&s;ed to give an
account of the <HI>More&s;co</HI> manner of re|ceiving
Publick Mini&s;ters, and finding
that they have no &s;olemn &amp; fixed Rites;
I conceive the de&s;cription of their en|tertaining
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Envoy, may &s;erve
<PB N="106" REF="61">
for a Specimen of their Carriage toward
all Per&s;ons of the like Character: which
take as follows.</P>
<P>The Envoy <HI>Don Diego Felippe de Pal|ma,</HI>
having from <HI>Ceuta</HI> (a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gari|&s;on
on the <HI>Barbary</HI>-coa&s;t) advi&s;ed <HI>Cidi el
Hader Ben Ali Gaylan,</HI> that he was come
from the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> on a Me&s;&s;age
to his Excellency (that was <HI>Gaylans</HI> Ti|tle)
and de&s;ired to know when and
where he &s;hould have permi&s;&s;ion and &s;e|curity
to deliver it: <HI>Gaylan</HI> returned
him an&s;wer, concerning the &s;et Day and
Place for the <HI>Don</HI>'s Reception, which
was according to our &s;tile, the tenth of
<HI>September,</HI> in the One thou&s;and &s;ix hun|dred
&s;ixty third Year of Grace, and at a
place equally di&s;tant from <HI>Ceuta</HI> and <HI>Ti|tuan:</HI>
where, to grace the <HI>Entrata, Gay|lan</HI>
appointed a Parade of the be&s;t Hor&s;e
of his own <HI>Cav&iacute;la,</HI> and committed them
to the Conduct of his Brother <HI>Cidi Tobib
Ebn Ali,</HI> who march'd with them from
<HI>Arz&iacute;la</HI> to <HI>Titu&agrave;n,</HI> whither according to
appointment, <HI>Gaylans</HI> Father-in-law,
<HI>Almocad&egrave;m</HI> of the <HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI> of <HI>Anger&agrave;,</HI> had
&s;ent his Sons with about &s;ixty of their
Cou&s;ens, to joyn with <HI>Tobib,</HI> who with
<PB N="107" REF="61">
many more went to receive the Envoy at
the prefixed time and place: Where the
<HI>Moors,</HI> having paid him their Greetings,
they all March'd in this order.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Troop came the two Sons
of the <HI>Almocad&egrave;m</HI> of <HI>Anger&agrave;,</HI> with about
&s;ixty of their Kindred, all bravely mount|ed,
and according to their Gallantry,
richly accoutred: The&s;e in &s;everal Rings
exercis'd the Lance with laudable Agi|lity,
the Mu&s;ick of <HI>Titu&agrave;n</HI> &s;till playing
before them.</P>
<P>In the next rank came <HI>Cidi Tobit,</HI> at|tended
with about fifty Hor&s;e, maintain|ing
a very &s;low march, as if they intend|ed
to revie or deride the Spani&s;h Gravi|ty.
Next to them rode the Envoy, <HI>Don
Diego Felippe de Palma del Habito de San|jago,</HI>
with a &s;ingle Trumpet &s;ounding be|fore
him: Next came led &s;ix &s;tately Hor|&s;es
trapt in blew Cloth: after them four|teen
Mules loaden with Trunks; and in
the la&s;t place rode the Governor of <HI>Ti|tu&agrave;n,</HI>
with the <HI>Al&aacute;rbes</HI> Mu&s;ick tinkling
before him, and attended with a large &amp;
well ordered Train. Va&s;t multitudes
were flockt thither, having no other bu|&s;ine&s;s
but to gaze, being Strangers to &s;uch
a Proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="62">
In this order was <HI>Don Diego</HI> conduct|ed
to his Lodgings in <HI>Titu&agrave;n,</HI> where he
courteou&s;ly received the Chri&s;tians that
came to give him the Parabien to <HI>Barba|ry,</HI>
and declar'd a great readine&s;s to
&s;erve my Camrade and my &s;elf, whom he
knew had no other concern in tho&s;e
Parts, but &s;ecurely to travel and view
the Countrey. After two days refre&s;h|ment
at the <HI>Moors</HI> charge, the <HI>Don</HI> be|gan
his march toward <HI>Arz&iacute;la,</HI> but fir&s;t
cau&s;ed the Hor&s;es to be richly trapt, and
led in State through the Streets of <HI>Titu|&agrave;n;</HI>
which being done, they came into
a Plain a little out of the Town, where
the People made a &s;pacious Circle, in
which the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Cavalleres &s;hewed
their active Hor&s;eman&s;hip, and dexte|rous
darting of the Lance; after which,
about fifty <HI>Negros</HI> and <HI>Al&aacute;rbes</HI> began a
Dance, which they performed with plea|&s;ant
variety of Ge&s;ture, and &s;trange A|gility.</P>
<P>The&s;e De&s;ports being fini&s;hed, the
Envoy advanceth his Journey, and found
the ways crowded with Spectators, invi|ted
thither by <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Politick Friends,
who de&s;igned that the People might take
<PB N="109" REF="62">
notice of the Honor done to <HI>Cidi El Ha|der,</HI>
and that his Friend&s;hip was &s;ought
by one of the greate&s;t of Chri&s;tian Mo|narchs.
But there were many that came
not &s;o much to be Spectators, as to reap
the fruit of a common Report, that the
<HI>Don</HI> would ca&s;t great &s;tore of Realito's
among the poorer <HI>Moors.</HI> But their hopes
were deceived in the rumour of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
Bounty, who did not herein de|generate
from the Nature of his Nation,
which has ever been noted for a back|wardne&s;s
to &s;uch in&s;ignificant Profu&s;i|ons.
The Envoy being &s;afely arrived at
<HI>Arz&iacute;la,</HI> he was lodged in an Apartment
of <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s Place (pardon the Word)
where I leave him to lodge, and eat, if
po&s;&s;ible, wor&s;e then he did at home.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s and de&s;ign of this Em|ba&s;&s;y,
met with diver&s;ity of Conjectures:
by &s;ome it was &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>Don Diego</HI>
was &s;ent to &s;ollicit larger Priviledges for
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garri&s;ons on the <HI>Barbarian</HI>
Coa&s;t. Others concluded that the Duke
of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> envious at the Earl of
<HI>Tiveot</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;&s;es again&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> and
his Truce concluded with <HI>Gaylan,</HI> cau&s;ed
this Me&s;&s;enger (a Creature of his own)
<PB N="110" REF="63">
to be &s;ent with In&s;tructions, to interrupt
and di&s;turb the new Corre&s;pondence
and Amity betwixt <HI>Tanger</HI> and <HI>El Hader.</HI>
But to find out the Riddle, I ploughed
with one of their own Heifers, having
employed a <HI>Moor</HI> ver&s;ed in publick Af|fairs,
(and recommended to me by that
great Lover of the Engli&s;h, <HI>Cidi Abdel|erim
Nac&s;is,</HI> then chief Governor of <HI>Ti|tuan)</HI>
who from the <HI>Spaniard</HI>'s inqui&s;i|tivene&s;s
after the &s;tate and condition of
<HI>Tanger,</HI> the number of the Souldiers,
the quantity of the con&s;tant Guards, the
heighth and &s;trength of the Walls, the
&s;ituation and number of the Guns ready
mounted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with his De&s;ign in a <HI>Mo|re&s;co</HI>
habit to take a narrow view of the
whole place (which in <HI>Gaylan</HI>'s company
within few days after he performed) fil|led
us with Jealou&s;ies that &s;ome mi&s;chief
was purpo&s;ed again&s;t <HI>Tanger.</HI> And it is
very certain, That the fore-mentioned
Duke had an evil Eye upon the Immortal
<HI>Tiveot,</HI> for the Renowned Victories
which under the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King he
atchieved again&s;t his Nations Intere&s;t in
the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> which aged Choler
he found highly inflam'd by the Victories
<PB N="111" REF="63">
gain'd by that <HI>indefatigable Captain</HI> over
his <HI>More&s;co</HI> Neighbors, which in&s;tigated
the Dukes &s;pleen not &s;o much again&s;t
<HI>Tanger,</HI> as its Re&s;torer <HI>Tiveot,</HI> who be|ing
at this time in <HI>England,</HI> took the ad|vantage
of his ab&s;ence to di&s;grace him
(if any &s;uch thing had been po&s;&s;ible) with
his new Confederate <HI>Gaylan.</HI> And ac|quie&s;cing

I pur&s;ue my Province in &s;etting down the

<P>I Have not found any Nation &s;o rude

of all <HI>Rites</HI> of Civility and Re&s;pect:
<PB N="112" REF="64">
for &s;ome tokens of honor &amp; kindne&s;s, &s;ome
terms of di&s;tance &amp; familiarity are u&s;ed
by the mo&s;t uncultivated. And the Moors
though they are very &s;paring in Comple|ments,
yet they u&s;e both words &amp; ge&s;tures
of Re&s;pect. Towards all &s;uperiours they
indifferently u&s;e the Compellative <HI>Cidi,</HI>
which is as exten&s;ive as [Sir;] To wo|men
of better quality they u&s;e <HI>Lala,</HI> &s;ig|nifying
as largely as <HI>Madam</HI> doth now
in <HI>England.</HI> And as to their outward
demon&s;trations of Re&s;pect, there is little
variation; for a grave inclination of the
body, with a putting the right hand fir&s;t
to the heart, next to the forehead, and
then ki&s;&s;ing the two foremo&s;t fingers laid
a cro&s;s the lips, is the exacte&s;t manner
of &s;aluteing the Grandees; who&s;e hand,
knee, or bottome of the Ve&s;t is ki&s;&s;ed
by the Vulgar. Tho&s;e that are familiar,
and of equal rank, at their fir&s;t meeting
&s;trike hands, but &s;hake not, &amp; then lift
them up &amp; lay them to their brea&s;ts. And
their greetings are in the &s;econd per&s;on
&s;ingular, u&s;eing [Thou] to all from the
&s;lave to the King: wherein they ob&s;erve
the Ea&s;tern Cu&s;tom. But in their addre&s;|&s;es
to their Prince no people can te&s;tify
<PB N="113" REF="64">
more &s;ignal tokens of Humblene&s;s &amp; Pi|ety,
for at the entrance into the Royal
pre&s;ence, they bow their bodies to the
ground, &s;aying, <HI>S&aacute;lam All&iacute;g All&aacute; En|&s;or&uacute;ck
Mul&egrave;y,</HI> Peace be to thee, God
pre&s;erve King <HI>Ful&aacute;no;</HI> &amp; the&s;e words &amp;

if any come with petitions they ki&s;&s;e, the
earth when they pre&s;ent them to his roy|al
peru&s;al. The like Reverences are di&s;|charged
when they depart the <HI>Pre&s;ence.</HI>
But I pa&s;s on to view the female Moors,
who if pre&s;erv'd from the injuries of the
Sun &amp; weather, are generally well comple|xion'd
full bodied, &amp; of good &s;ymmetry.
Tho&s;e that live in great Towns, together
with the wealthier &s;ort in the Country,
are enclin'd to palene&s;s, which may be
imputed to their &s;edentarine&s;s, or <HI>want
of motion;</HI> for they &s;eldom &s;tir abroad, ex|cept
it be to vi&s;it the Sepulchers of
their decea&s;ed friends in devotion, to
pray for their felicity, and in the night
time to the Baths for health and cleanli|ne&s;s.
As to their Friday-meetings I &s;hall
&s;peak of it in another Chapter. They
never &s;tep without the thre&s;hold but &s;o
<PB N="114" REF="65">
clo&s;ely vail'd, that no part is vi&s;ible but
an eye. In the &s;tate of Matrimony their
principal &s;tudie is to plea&s;e their hu&s;|bands,
to whom they are taught by their
<HI>Alcoran</HI> to bear a dutiful ob&s;ervancy, and
to omit no art that may render them de|lightful
to their conver&s;ation. Tho&s;e hus|bands
that are able, allow their wives <HI>Ne|gra</HI>'s
or <HI>black-women,</HI> to doe all the &s;er|vile
offices in the Family; but yet there is
no quality that &s;its idle; for the cheif of
the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Dames imploy their time in
&s;ome thrifty hu&s;wifry. And this pre|vents
that cu&s;tom of <HI>expen&s;ive go&s;&s;ippings,</HI>
with which in &s;ome <HI>Nations</HI> &s;o many
wives are debauched, and husbands <HI>beg|gar'd.</HI>
And yet the married women want
not their <HI>friendly conver&s;ations,</HI> for they
vi&s;it one anothers hou&s;es in token of
good <HI>neighbourhood,</HI> but without the com|pany
of their husbands; no male though
he be never &s;o much a relative, can be ad|mitted
into their &s;ociety. And to prevent
it, &s;he that makes the vi&s;it fir&s;t, &s;ends to
know whether the husband be at home
if the an&s;wer be negative, then without
further ceremony &s;he goes &s;traight to her
Go&s;&s;ips apartment, where &s;he is enter|tain'd
<PB N="115" REF="65">
with a liberality that never injures
her husband; who if returning home in
the interim of the vi&s;it, is careful to give
no interruption, but upon notice quickly
departs the hou&s;e; yet they give &s;uch
&s;ignals that he has bin there, as are ea&s;ily
perceived by the <HI>Vi&s;itant,</HI> who thereupon
&s;hortens the Vi&s;it, otherwi&s;e it common|ly
la&s;ts a whole day. But the&s;e being
offices that are &s;eldome in their returns,
may ju&s;tly be pardon'd in their length.</P>
<P>But fore&s;eeing that I &s;hall in another

both from the di&s;cour&s;e and practi&s;e of
tho&s;e with whom I journy'd, who at
their &s;etting out in the morning, would
with zeal and humility look up to hea|ven,
and in a low voice &s;ay, <HI>Bi&s;millah,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="66">
that is, in the name of God; which is al|&s;o
done at the beginning of any labour
or travail. By which they intend that
nothing ought to be enterpri&s;ed, but in
the power and hope of the divine favour
and help. And when the work or jour|ney
is fini&s;hed they &s;ay, <HI>Ham der illah,</HI>
Thanks be unto God; in which words
they deny all a&s;criptions of &s;ucce&s;s to
them&s;elves. When they meet one ano|ther
upon the road, &amp;c. their greetings
at large is this thank&s;giving, <HI>El ham dil|lah
al &s;alam tiq&s;i.</HI> i. e. God be prai&s;ed
that I &s;ee thee well: but in pa&s;&s;ing by one
another the Salutation is u&s;ually this
prayer, if there be no more but one,
<HI>Salam alleq,</HI> if more than one, <HI>Salam al|leq

At the hearing of one another &s;neez,
they &s;ay, <HI>Era hanig allah, Dios tenga

When one Moor goes to &s;ee another at
his hou&s;e, the fir&s;t that receives him &s;aith,
<HI>Mar b&aacute;ba,</HI> or welcom, which if repeated
thrice, is an undoubted marke that they

he requites with &s;aying,

<P>IN the Year of Salvation, 1663. <HI>Sept.</HI>
the &s;ixth, at the going down of the
Sun, we came to an <HI>Ald&eacute;a</HI> called <HI>Anger&agrave;,</HI>
at the utmo&s;t Bounds of a Mountain of
that name; where we repair'd to the
Hou&s;e of <HI>Cidi Ca&s;&s;ian Shat,</HI> whom we
found &s;itting at his Door, environ'd with
about twenty aged <HI>Moors</HI> of the Neigh|borhood.
Alighting from our Hor&s;es,
we deliver'd our <HI>Seg&uacute;ra</HI> or Letters of
&s;afe Conduct, to the Old Man; who
when he had peru&s;ed, return'd them
with a grave Nod, the te&s;timony of his
Approbation, and the &s;ignal of our Wel|come.
This done, we were called to a
little upper Room, which we could not
enter till we had put off our Shoos at
the Thre&s;hold; not for Religion, but
<PB N="124" REF="70">
Cleanline&s;s, and not to prevent our un|hallowing
of the Floor, but defiling the
Carpets wherewith it was curiou&s;ly
&s;pread. At the upper end of the Room
was laid a Velvit Cu&s;hion, as large as
tho&s;e we u&s;e in our Pulpits, and it deno|ted
the mo&s;t Honourable part of the
Room. After we had repo&s;ed about an
hour, there was brought in a little oval
Table, about twenty Inches high, which
was covered with a long piece of narrow
Linnen; and this &s;erved for Diaper. For
the <HI>Moors,</HI> by their Law, are forbidden
&s;uch &s;uperfluous Uten&s;ils as Napkins,
Knives, Spoons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Their Religion lay|ing
down this general Maxim, <HI>That meer
Nece&s;&s;aries are to be provided for:</HI> which
cau&s;ed a preci&s;e <HI>Moor</HI> to refu&s;e to drink
out of my Di&s;h, when he could &s;up Wa|ter
enough out of the hollow of his
Hand. But this &s;traitne&s;s has of late
Years begun to be enlarged, and the pro|hibition
is interpreted to reach no far|ther
then their Church-men, and chief
Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice; &s;o that tho&s;e who
are able to provide hand&s;ome Furniture
for their Tables, have a Di&s;pen&s;ation,
which they &s;eem not prone to make u&s;e
<PB N="125" REF="70">
of, if the humour of the re&s;t may be de|vined
by that of this Grandee: At who&s;e
Hou&s;e the Table was adorned as before,
and for Supper there was placed upon
it an Earthen Pot full of Mutton, Beef,
Cabage, Rai&s;ins, Potato's, Bereng&eacute;nas,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all boyled together, and extream|ly
hot with Dimicuto and Garlick, which
is their immutable Sawce. This hodge|podge
was in imitation of the <HI>Spani&s;h
Olla Podrida,</HI> excepting that it wanted
Bacon, an Ingredient &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ible
to the <HI>Spani&s;h Olla,</HI> that there can be
none without it, which occa&s;ion'd this
Proverb, <HI>No Sermon without St.</HI> Au&s;tin,
<HI>nor</HI> Olla <HI>without Bacon: Ny Serm&ograve;n &s;in</HI>
Ago&s;tino, <HI>ny</HI> Olla <HI>&s;in locino.</HI> But to pro|ceed
in our Bill of Fare: our next Cour&s;e
was a &s;ingle Pullet cloven down the Bel|ly,
with the four Quarters &s;pread out at
large, by a way of Cookery peculiar to
the <HI>Moors.</HI> And the&s;e two Di&s;hes, with
&s;tore of good Bread, made up the Fea&s;t.
Our Drink was &s;trong Wine newly
brought from the Pre&s;s, which &s;tood by
us in a great &s;tone Jar, with a &s;ort of
wooden Ladle in it, out of which we
drunk. Our po&s;ture was laying round
<PB N="126" REF="71">
about the Table, according to the cu|&s;tom
of the Countrey. Our company was
the &s;econd Son of this Family, a debo|nair
Gentile Per&s;on. Having &s;upp'd,
and &s;olaced our &s;elves with muddy Be|verage
and <HI>More&s;co</HI> Mu&s;ic, we all compo|&s;ed
our &s;elves to &s;leep: About twenty
were allotted to Lodge in this &s;mall
Chamber, whereof two were Chri&s;tians,
three Jews, and the re&s;t <HI>Moors:</HI> every
one made his Bed of what he wore, which
made our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con&s;titutions to wi&s;h
for the Morning, which no &s;ooner ap|peared
but we quitted our Lodging, lea|ving
our Entertainer <HI>&s;ans adieu,</HI> not tar|rying
to return thanks for his Ho&s;pitali|ty;
which could incur no di&s;plea&s;ure, as
conforming to the &s;tile of the Countrey.
And this Breviate of <HI>Cidi Ca&s;&s;ian</HI>'s ho&s;pi|table
Hou&s;e-keeping, is an E&s;&s;ay of the
re&s;t, for the <HI>Moors</HI> have all one fa&s;hion of
living, and their Hou&s;es, Diet, and Ap|parel
vary not, but in the matter.</P>
<P>Now that which makes Journying in
<HI>Barbary</HI> &s;o full of Fatigue, is the want
of Hou&s;es of Publick Entertainment
(like the <HI>Venta</HI>'s and <HI>Pos&aacute;da</HI>'s in <HI>Spain;</HI>
the <HI>Caborets</HI> and <HI>Hostelries</HI> in <HI>France;</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="71">
and Inns in <HI>England)</HI> whereby the Tra|vellers
are con&s;train'd to carry their Pro|vi&s;ions
with them. The <HI>Moors</HI> u&s;ual Vi|aticum
are Rai&s;ins, parch'd Beans, Ony|ons,
Garlick, and &s;tore of Bread. They
rely upon the Fountains for their Drink,
which are kept in great decency and
cleanlyne&s;s: at every Fountain there be|ing
a Di&s;h made of Cork, fa&s;tned with a
&s;tring, out of which Man and Bea&s;t drink
for refre&s;hment. Many of the&s;e Foun|tains
are provided with a large &s;mooth
Stone, whereon the <HI>Moor,</HI> after he has
perform'd his preparative Wa&s;hing, ce|lebrates
his <HI>Salla,</HI> or Ori&s;ons. And the
<HI>Bigots</HI> that live near the&s;e Fountains, e|very
day repair thither to pay their <HI>Bi|gotage,</HI>
or Super&s;titious Devotions.</P>
<P>They u&s;ually &s;hut up their Journey at
the going down of the Sun; and if there
be an <HI>Ald&eacute;a</HI> or Village at hand, they turn
thither for Hou&s;e-room, and lodge com|monly
in a Cotage, as mean as that
wherein <HI>Ovid</HI>'s aged Couple entertain'd
the Pilgrim Gods. But if it be Summer,
or the Weather fair, then they repair to
&s;ome &s;hady Tree, under who&s;e prote|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tion
they &s;leep and eat. If the place

be &s;u&s;pected for bad Neighbors, the Tra|vellers
watch by turns, and do the like
in places that are troubled with wild
Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>When I &s;aid that the <HI>Moors</HI> have no
Hou&s;es of Accommodation, it was with
exception of the <HI>Almam&oacute;ra</HI>'s, or Cham|bers
maintain'd by the Revenues of the
Church, built on purpo&s;e to receive
Strangers of any Per&s;wa&s;ion. The&s;e
Hou&s;es afford nothing but room to Lodge
in; but if it happen that Travellers are
in want of meat, the Villagers are ready
to &s;upply them. The <HI>Alfaq&uacute;i,</HI> or Prie&s;t
of the place, hath In&s;pection and Super|intendency
of the&s;e Ho&s;pitals. The
<HI>Moors</HI> have likewi&s;e peculiar Places, re|&s;embling
the Infirmatories or <HI>Lazaret|to</HI>'s
in other Nations, for tho&s;e that fall
&s;ick in their Journeys, whom they treat
with a laudable Care, till they either re|cover
or dye: And if the infirm dye, not
leaving wherewith to bury him, there is
care taken for his Funeral, and a <HI>Mu|l&aacute;to,</HI>
or &s;ome ba&s;er <HI>Moor,</HI> is appointed
to beg the Alms of the place to defray
the Expence of the Strangers Interment.
In the&s;e <HI>Almam&oacute;ra</HI>'s, the Stranger is per|mitted
<PB N="129" REF="73">
to &s;tay till the Weather and his
Health di&s;po&s;e him for his Journey: but
they repine at his abode, when it is not
urged by nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>In later Years, every Town of Tra&s;|fick
hath erected a &s;ort of Inns, called
<HI>Alfand&aacute;ch,</HI> which affords nothing but
Hou&s;e-room for Man and Bea&s;t, the Mar|ket
yielding Provi&s;ion for both. Tho&s;e
that farm the&s;e <HI>Fand&aacute;chs,</HI> cannot exact
above a Blankil a Night both for Man and
Bea&s;t, which is in &s;terling Money about
two pence. The Hor&s;es Lodging co&s;ting
equally with his Riders.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Fand&aacute;chs</HI> were at fir&s;t built by
the wealthier &s;ort of <HI>Moors,</HI> who dying
in a pious humour, gave them to the <HI>Gi|&aacute;mma</HI>
or Church, to hallow, &s;ay the <HI>Mo|re&s;co</HI>
Rabbies, the filthy lucre rai&s;ed by
their employment. However, the <HI>Gi|&aacute;mma</HI>
has its Revenues greatly augment|ed
by &s;uch Donations. And whatever
was the De&s;ign of their In&s;titution, we
find them of late under a great Degene|racy,
being little better then Tipling
Shops, where the <HI>Moors</HI> Quaff the Fruit
of the Vine. But that which herein mo&s;t
rai&s;ed my Admiration, was to &s;ee the In|comes
<PB N="130" REF="74">
of the&s;e <HI>Fand&aacute;chs,</HI> appropriated
to the maintenance of the <HI>Alfaq&uacute;i</HI>'s or
Prie&s;ts, and that that Holy Order, ha|ving
the di&s;po&s;al of &s;uch Hou&s;es, &s;hould
not &s;ee them under a more regular admi|ni&s;tration.</P>
<P>But to go from the&s;e Publick Hou&s;es
to view the <HI>Moors</HI> in their private Roofs,
I find them in their Care&s;&s;es frugal, with|out
Par&s;imoniou&s;ne&s;s, and placing no
Character of good Hou&s;e-keeping in a|bundance
of Viands. They have two
di&s;hes in &s;ingular e&s;teem, the chief where|of
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;cu&s;s&ograve;n,</HI> which is made of Water
and Flower, or grated Bread, boyled
into a Con&s;i&s;tence, into which they put
Butter, or any Kitchin-&s;tuff: And this
they eat without Spoons; for when it is
ready, every one that is admitted to ta&s;te
it, dives into it with his hand, and dance|ing
it in his Fi&s;t, till it be &s;hap'd into a
Ball and cool'd, then ca&s;ts it into his
Mouth. The other di&s;h is known by the
name of <HI>Pill&oacute;w,</HI> vulgarly pronounced
<HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">w,</HI> and it is the &s;ame with that which
I &s;aid has &s;o near a re&s;emblance with the
Spani&s;h <HI>Olla Podrida.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e two
Di&s;hes, the <HI>Moors</HI> of a better allay make
<PB N="131" REF="74">
their Breakfa&s;ts of <HI>Bonu&eacute;lo</HI>'s, or &s;mall
Loaves boyled in Oyl, which they eat
with Sugar, or Honey.</P>
<P>The Countrey <HI>Moors</HI> feed much on
Milk, which they are by their Law for|bidden
to ta&s;te, if it has been touch'd
by a Dog. They have &s;tore of Chee&s;e,
but very cour&s;e and homely. And as for
their Butter, we may &s;u&s;pect their clean|line&s;s
in making it; for they Churn it
in a Sheep or Goat skin, dre&s;&s;ed or fit|ted
for that office, which they &s;hake be|tween
their Hands.</P>
<P>But not much delighted with their
Dary-hou&s;e, I leave it to ob&s;erve their
Reverence to Bread and Corn, which is
both great and general, for from the
Throne to the Plough, if any &s;ee a crum
of the one, or a grain of the other ca&s;t
out, or &s;catter'd, he &s;toops to take it
up, ki&s;&s;eth it, puts it to his Fore-head,
and looking up, &s;aith, <HI>Dill an, It is from

to whom for the Power &amp; Sacredne&s;s of
their Function there have ever bin de|creed
<PB N="133" REF="75">
convenient Ob&s;ervances and Re|venues.
How determinate the <HI>Alchoran</HI>
is in the&s;e particulars, falls not within
the compa&s;s of the&s;e remarkes, but it is
evident to tho&s;e that attentively read it,
that the Author thereof &s;eems not in a|ny
thing to be definitive. But what ever
the mind was of that Impo&s;tor concern|ing
the mentioned Rites, we find his
Sectaries have in all their Dominions
made Provi&s;ion for Solemnity in their
Wor&s;hip. Being guided thereunto ei|ther
by the more la&s;ting and regular
Principles of Rea&s;on, or in imitation
of &s;ome people of an other Per&s;wa&s;ion,
which they e&s;teem'd Wi&s;e and Delibe|rate.
Nor can <HI>Mahumed</HI> be blamed for
not leaving Decretals in the Rights of
wor&s;hip, becau&s;e their nature is of &s;o
great an indifferency, that no Religion
doth acknowledge them to be determi|ned
in every particular by any Law,
meriting, or u&s;urping, the title Divine:
neither is there any thing in them&s;elves
to make them originally nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>And therefore without enquiring in|to
the Motives by which the Moors or o|thers
have been induced to the u&s;age of
<PB N="134" REF="76">
the Acce&s;&s;ories of Religion, I only ob|&s;erve
that the Moors are not therein de|fective;
having Churches, Prie&s;ts, Times,
Revenues, &amp;c. appropriate to the Di|vine
Adoration.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with their Gi&aacute;mma's,
Mo&s;chs or Churches in which this Coun|trey
abounds, and to which the Moors
perform a great Reverence and libera|lity,
never &s;uffering them to be pro|fan'd,
nor to want a competent &s;tock
to keep them in repaires. The manner
ob&s;erv'd in the erection of a new Gi|&aacute;mma
is orderly and laudable, which
is thus: When a con&s;iderable Number
of People have agreed and re&s;olved to
&s;ettle together in neighborhood, they
&s;eek out a piece of ground convenient
for their purpo&s;e, which by mutual con|&s;ent
is divided, every family being al|lowed
&s;ufficient Room, whereof to
rear an habitation. This done their
next care is to &s;et apart a &s;pot of Earth
for the foundation of their Gi&aacute;mma,
with great regard that it have no con&s;i|derable
inequality of di&s;tance from their
&s;everal habitations. After they have
thus fram'd their De&s;igne, the Gi&aacute;mma
<PB N="135" REF="76">
is fir&s;t built, to which Holy work all a|ges,
&s;exes, and qualities of per&s;ons con|tribute
their labours Gratis, every one
valuing it for a peculiar felicity and ho|nour
to have his hands and &s;houlders
wearied in &s;uch a &s;acred imployment.
The fabrick or Gi&aacute;mma being fini&s;h'd,
they dedicate it to no Patronage but the
Publique Wor&s;hip, nor u&s;e any other
ceremony of con&s;ecration, but only
choo&s;e one that is able to read the <HI>Al|coran,</HI>
whom they accompany to the new
Gi&aacute;mma, where &s;ome parcel of their
Law is read, and their Sall&agrave;'s, or offices
perform'd, and from that time it is ac|counted
a Holy place. And the Gi&aacute;mma
being thus rai&s;ed to its full Stature, eve|ry
family begins a Cotage for it &s;elf,
and when they are built, they &s;eek for
an Alfaqui, or Prie&s;t, to Officiate in
their new Church, with whom they a|gree
for a yearly Pen&s;ion.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t re&s;train this cu&s;tome of
building Churches to the <HI>Barab&aacute;rs</HI> who
have fixed Man&s;ions; for the <HI>Al&aacute;rbs</HI> who
retain no place of con&s;tant habitation,
have for their Gi&aacute;mma a large Tent
&s;tanding exactly in the middle of their
<PB N="136" REF="77">
dwelling-Tents, whither they re&s;ort at
Canonical hours to their Ori&s;ons, in
which they are comformable to the o|ther
Moors.</P>
<P>The Gi&aacute;mma's doe all agree in the
fa&s;hion of &s;tructure; being all long and
generally narrow, not running into
Iles, nor branching into Chappels and
Quires. Their &s;ituation is Ea&s;t and
We&s;t, without any windows at all, nor
have their Gi&aacute;mma's doores but on the
North-&s;ide. <HI>[They are without the too
ea&s;ie accommodations of &s;eats, Pews, or ben|ches:]</HI>
the floor of the Gi&aacute;mma is hand|&s;omely
matted, and &s;o are the walls a|bout
two foot high. If the roof be large
and weighty it is &s;upported with pillars,
among which hang the lamps, which are
kept burning all the night.</P>
<P>Every Gi&aacute;mma has a turret, on who&s;e
top is placed a Cre&s;cent, or half Moon
(a <HI>Mahumedan</HI> Cognizance) from this
Turret the <HI>Almud&eacute;n,</HI> or Sexton, with a
loud voice invites the People to Prayers,
which &s;upplies the forbidden u&s;e of
Bells. The Moors keep their Gi&aacute;mma's
in a very Reverend decency, never per|mitting
any dilapidations. None are
<PB N="137" REF="77">
vouch&s;afed to enter them but the Males
of their own Religion, which makes it
dangerous for Chri&s;tians or Jews to
look within them; yet if this happens
they think not the Holy place to be
thereby any way de&s;ecrated. But this
&s;ignal re&s;pect to their Churches, renders
not their Devotions el&s;ewhere perfor|m'd,
to be invalid; yet if po&s;&s;ible they
never faile to be at their Gi&aacute;mm's, attri|buting
much to the Statary prayers made
in the Church.</P>
<P>In greater Towns there are many
Gi&aacute;mma's: in <HI>Titu&agrave;n</HI> fifteen, in <HI>Alc&aacute;zar</HI>
more, in <HI>Arz&iacute;la,</HI> five, and in <HI>Fez</HI> &s;even
hundred. Among which there is a &s;ub|ordination,
for the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma Gheber,</HI> or
<HI>Great Gi&aacute;mma,</HI> being the <HI>Cathedral,</HI> or
Mother-Church, commands the re&s;t, and
is the Cure of the <HI>Alcalib,</HI> or Chief-Prie&s;t.
To the <HI>Giamma Gheber</HI> all the
other Gi&aacute;mma's conforme in the houre
of publique offices, and though all the
re&s;t are hung with Lamps, yet this has
one of a peculiar &s;hape and quantity,
called Ettouria, or the Ma&s;ter-Lamp,
in te&s;timony of the Chutche's Prelacy.</P>

<P>THe Moors have at this day no

<PB N="139" REF="78">
Mo&s;aic Arches and brazen gates) it is
now wholly de&s;titute of Students. And
if the Moors were not carefull to keep
up great &s;tore of Petty Schooles, they
would &s;oon decay and fall into a total
illiterature. In the&s;e Petty Scholes the
<HI>Alf&aacute;qui,</HI> or Prie&s;t, takes in the fir&s;t rudi|ments
of his Learning, without any po&s;|&s;ibility
of climbing higher than to write
and read; and if a Youth be found to|wardly
and capacious, and bearing a
good affection to the Prie&s;thood, when
he has arriv'd to the fir&s;t forme in the
School, he is removed thence, and placed
with one of the be&s;t learned <HI>Alf&agrave;qui's</HI> in
the Town, or <HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI> where the School is
kept. And this new Tutor in&s;tructs his
Pupil to read the <HI>Alcoran</HI> with per&s;picu|ity,
and to under&s;tand the principal
points it containes: The Tutor likewi&s;e
informes him of all the Rites of the Gi|&aacute;mma,
which being both few and ea&s;y,
are quickly obtain'd; and when the
Schollar is deem'd competent both for
age and Learning to be a Prie&s;t, then
his In&s;titutor call's two or three <HI>Al|f&aacute;quis</HI>
more to examine the Candidate,
who being found de&s;erving, they grant
<PB N="140" REF="79">
him Te&s;timonials of his willingne&s;s and
abilities to be an <HI>Alf&aacute;qui:</HI> And this is
all the education and Orders, which I
could ob&s;erve to be be&s;towed upon their
Prie&s;ts. But it is very remarkable, that
among the Moors none are admitted to
this Holy Dignity, but &s;uch as are of a
competent age, and marryed; for the
former they render this rea&s;on, a No|vice
ought not to be admitted to the
Prie&s;thood; but I conceive that their jea|lou&s;ie,
with which they are notoriou&s;ly
gifted, is the fitte&s;t account can be gi|ven
of the later.</P>
<P>The Moors &s;uffer no Gi&aacute;mma to be
vacant, becau&s;e they e&s;teem an <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI>
to be altogether nece&s;&s;ary to exteri|or
Religion; and that Common Per&s;ons,
or the Laity, performing the &s;olemn
offices of Religion, doth make them com|mon.
For Holy Rites are no more to
be di&s;pen&s;ed by all, than the &s;ecular
Laws; and though all men have common
Intere&s;t both in Religion &amp; the Laws,
yet all cannot be Admini&s;ters of either.
And upon this con&s;ideration, that in the
Combinations and Communions of men
Religion cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without &s;ome
<PB N="141" REF="79">
to guide, officiate, and pre&s;cribe the
mini&s;teries thereof, the Moors are dili|gent
to provide an <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> for every Gi|&aacute;mma,
that there may be no vacancy,
nor omi&s;&s;ion in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> the Lay-Moors pay a
&s;ignal Reverence, giving him the more
honourable hand, and place. They
plough his ground, dre&s;s his vineyard,
reap his Corn, &amp;c. to the end that by no
&s;ecular cares he may be interrupted in
his Function; And by this I am guided
to look into the office of the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui,</HI>
which is fir&s;t, to pre&s;erve the Gi&aacute;mma in
decency, and to provide that the &s;tru|cture
be not dilap&s;ed, &amp; that the Lamps
and matts be duely &s;upplyed. But the
Prie&s;t never puts his hand to any &s;er|vile
work, having tho&s;e under him upon
whom all the drudgery is di&s;charged.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part of the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI>'s of|fice
is, to in&s;pect the In&s;titution of the
children; to which purpo&s;e he hath u|&s;ually
under him, one that is fit for the
toyle, and re&s;erves to him&s;elf no more
but the examination of the Childrens
proficiency, which he doth once a week;
and tho&s;e whom he finds remi&s;s, receive
<PB N="142" REF="80">
his Correction, but the diligent, the
marks of his approbation. They have
no free Schools, but pay a weekly &s;alary
to tho&s;e whom the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> doth appoint
to teach, for none can be a School-Ma|&s;ter
without his Licence and approof.</P>
<P>His next care is to take notice who
ab&s;ent them&s;elves from the Gi&aacute;mma,
having power at his own di&s;cretion to
puni&s;h whom&s;oever he ob&s;erves to be
therein delinquent. He is very vigilant
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ick, whom dying he accom|panies
to the Grave. If there happen a|ny
di&s;agreement among the Neighbours,
the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> mediates a reconcilement,
but if the Quarrel exceeds ill language,
and be concerning <HI>Meum</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> he
is not permitted to intermeddle.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> di&s;like his Cure, he hath
liberty of removall, being not confin'd
to any <HI>Parochial</HI> Gi&aacute;mma above a year,
and he &s;eldome contracts for a longer
&s;pace. And for that time he is the Su|perintendent
of the <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> out of who&s;e
Rents he defraies all the Charges for
Reparations, &amp;c. takeing the &s;urplu|&s;age
for him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>And now the remarke pa&s;&s;eth to the
<PB N="143" REF="80">
Revenues of the Gi&aacute;mma, which chiefly
ari&s;e from the Donatives of the dead. In
&s;ome places the Incoms are very large,
in all comfortable; for the Moors ex|erci&s;e
a great benevolence to places de|dicated
to Religion: whereby they re|proach
many &s;tiled Chri&s;tians, who ca&s;t
a&s;ide the lea&s;t &s;heaf for the Tenth, and
who are &s;o far from enlarging the Church|es
Patrimony, that they are ready to
devour the pitiful Remainder that &s;he
&s;till enjoyes.</P>
<P><HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> in his third Com|mandment,
enjoynes his <HI>Mu&s;almim</HI> Li|berality,
and Alm&s;-deeds, which pro|ceeding
from goods hone&s;tly gotten are
according to the <HI>Alcoran</HI> meritorious of
Paradi&s;e. He likwi&s;e prefers private
Almes before the publick, and declares
the Devil to be an inplacable enemy a|gain&s;t
this expre&s;&s;ion of mercy. And in|deed
there are many &s;uch pious do|ctrines
in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but they are but
as &s;o many good eares of corn in a good
field of Tares, or as &s;o many &s;ingle grains
lo&s;t in a heap of chaff: it having been
the &s;ubtilty of the old Serpent in all a|ges,
to guild over his poy&s;onous Pills,
<PB N="144" REF="81">
and to blend Truth with fal&s;hood, that
the latter might be embrac'd for the &s;ake
of the former. Be&s;ides it is an ancient
mi&s;take to think, that Truth and fal&s;hood
are of too great a contrariety and di|&s;tance
to mingle and concorporate;
which makes many when they have found
&s;ome truth in Doctrine, to conclude no
fal&s;hood to be joyned with it. And tho&s;e
truths which are di&s;per&s;ed up and down
in <HI>Mahumed</HI>'s Law, being evident to its
Profe&s;&s;ors, make them credulous of the
whole &s;y&s;tem. And though they are
zealous for all the precepts, yet for
none more than that which concernes
Alm&s;-deeds; for they have their <HI>A&s;ho|r&agrave;h</HI>
which is an Anniver&s;ary Fe&s;tival,
whereat they be&s;tow a certain quanti|ty
of their Sub&s;tance upon the Poore.
But the greate&s;t Bounties are towards
the Gi&aacute;mma, to which every one at his
death leaves a Portion of his e&s;tate, by
which method the Gi&aacute;mma has con&s;ide|rable
endowments, which are under a
continual improvement, and made ca|pable
of no manner of Alienation.</P>
<P>To every Gi&aacute;mma there belongs an <HI>Al|mud&egrave;n,</HI>
or a kind of Sexton, who&s;e of|fice
<PB N="145" REF="81">
is to call the people to Church at the
houres of prayer; which he doth from
the top of the Turret (mention'd a|bove)
crying with a voice articulate
and loud, <HI>Ill&aacute;h Gheb&egrave;r, God is the great;</HI>
and &s;ometimes, <HI>Laill&aacute;h La Mahum&egrave;d Re|&s;&uacute;l
all&aacute;.</HI> There is but one God, and <HI>Ma|humed</HI>
the Me&s;&s;enger of God. And the&s;e
words the <HI>Almud&egrave;n</HI> pronounceth at e|very
corner of the Turret, beginning
at the Ea&s;t, and ending at the point that
looks toward <HI>Mecha;</HI> by which they &s;i|gnify,
that all the corners of the world
&s;hould look towards <HI>Mecha</HI> in wor&s;hip|ing
the Deity, that is be <HI>Mahumedans.</HI></P>
<P>The next office of the <HI>Almud&egrave;n</HI> is, to
open the doores of the Gi&aacute;mma, to trim
the Lamps, and keep the matts in repair
and cleanline&s;s. He al&s;o informes the
<HI>Alf&aacute;qui,</HI> who hath an inherent power
to puni&s;h tho&s;e who can &s;how no good
rea&s;on of their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>But the penalty is very tolerable, be|ing
no more than five or &s;ix pounds of
<HI>Cu&s;cu&s;s&ograve;w,</HI> which the offender brings to
the Gi&aacute;mma, where it is eaten by the
Prie&s;t and the A&s;&s;embly. None are found
to offend therein through contempt, or
<PB N="146" REF="82">
wilfulne&s;s, nor yet through the pur&s;u|ance
of their plea&s;ures; for there is &s;o
&s;trict an ob&s;ervance of the Church-&s;er|vice,
that the husband will leave the &s;ocie|ty
of his wife to be there, if he hears the
<HI>Almud&egrave;n</HI> &s;peaking the <HI>Invitatory.</HI> The la&s;t
branch of the <HI>Almuden</HI>'s office is to di&s;|mi&s;s
the people, which he doth at the
end of the Salla, or Ori&s;ons, in the &s;ame
words that he called them together. And
now before I clo&s;e up this chapter, I
cannot, &s;peaking of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tique
penance, but ob&s;erve that the Moors have
no &s;uch thing as excommunication, &s;o
that they are for no crime debarr'd the
Gi&aacute;mma; but on the contrary the grea|te&s;t
mulct inflicted by the Prie&s;t is for
their ab&s;ence, above three times in twen|ty

&s;olemnities &s;ome of the Moors have
ob&s;erv'd to be of a far different character.
And this I learned from a Moor who had
unluckily been in England to make the
animadver&s;ion, with whome when I di&s;|cours'd
about this point, he told me
with anger and indignation in his looks,
that it was a &s;hame to &s;ee women, Dogs,
and dirty &s;hooes, brought into a place
&s;acred to God's wor&s;hip, and that men
&s;hould walk and di&s;cour&s;e in a <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI>
as in a publick <HI>Bor&s;a</HI> or <HI>Exchange,</HI> and
that they &s;hould have Chaires there to
&s;it in with as much la&s;civious ea&s;e, as at
<PB N="151" REF="84">
home: which with other actions of the
like irreverence he zealou&s;ly repeated to
reproach the Chri&s;tian. And indeed I
was not furni&s;ht with arguments to
(nor could in con&s;cience) excu&s;e any
con&s;iderable part of his Animadver&s;ion:
only I told him; That as for the exclu|&s;ion
of Women from the publick offices
of the <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> it was a doctrine of the <HI>Al|coran,</HI>
grounded upou conceits of imper|fection
peculiar to that &s;ex, which are
not &s;o far to be own'd, as for them to ex|clude
the females from the meanes of
their chiefe&s;t felicity. Be&s;ides this ex|communion
of women, was an Article of
Intere&s;t and Policy, and which <HI>Mahu|med</HI>
adopted into his Religion on pur|po&s;e
to complea&s;e the Jew, who at this
day begins his publick Prayer with a
thank&s;giving to God, <HI>que no le hizo mu|ger,</HI>
that he did not make him a woman,
a creature not allowed to &s;erve him in
the Synagogue, &amp; that &s;eeing we wanted
rea&s;ons which moved the Moors to this
practice, we could incurr no &s;candal by
its rejection. As for his objecting our
bringing Dogs into the Church, I told him
it was an uncomely and irreverend per|mi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="152" REF="85">
&amp; wholly abhorr'd by knowing.
Chri&s;tians; that there was a Provi&s;ion
made again&s;t it, and that it had been his
ill hap to look into a Church, where the
Sanction in that particular met with a
remi&s;s execution. Next, as to our ha|ving
&s;eates in the <HI>Mo&s;ch</HI> (for I was to
&s;peak in his own dialect) and to &s;it at
&s;ome parts of Divine &s;ervice, Cu&s;tom
and innocent convenience were all
that any one could pretend to hollow
it. But as for walking in the Church
in time of Divine Service, or therein
at any time to di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ecular con|cernments,
that it was only the pra|cti&s;e
of profane and ill di&s;ciplin'd
minds, the mi&s;carriage of the rude,
contrary to the Rule, and a certain ar|gument
of a relaxed Di&s;cipline and neg|ligent
Superintendent.
<Q>Pudet haec opprobria&mdash;.</Q>
But I return to the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma,</HI> whither the
<HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> comes not till a con&s;iderable
number of the People are a&s;&s;embled;
who in the Prie&s;ts ab&s;ence &s;pend their
time in a devout repetition of the <HI>Sal|lah,</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="85">
a Word that &s;ignifies the whole
Form of their Prayers. And when the
<HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> is come, he advanceth &s;traight to
the South-&s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> and the
People fall orderly into ranks behind
him. Upon this the Prie&s;t begins the
Prayer in a Voice moderately elevated,
which the People humbly repeat after
him. At the pronouncing of <HI>Illah El
Gheber,</HI> that is, <HI>God is the great,</HI> they
all u&s;e an Elevation both of Hands and
Eyes to Heaven: at the name of <HI>Mecha,</HI>
they all ki&s;s the Ground; but when they
mention <HI>Muley Mahumed,</HI> and the Mer|cies
he procures them, they fall pro&s;trate,
and upon the &s;udden, in a kind of Ra|pture,
rea&s;&s;ume an erect. When the
Prie&s;t hath repeated <HI>la illah Mahumed
Re&s;ul Allah</HI> four times, the <HI>Almuden</HI> di&s;|mi&s;&s;eth
the People. And when they
leave the <HI>Giamma,</HI> the <HI>Alf&aacute;qui</HI> goes fir&s;t,
as a token of his Prelacy above the Peo|ple.
Their <HI>Sall&aacute;h</HI> or Service is very
&s;hort, for if it took up any con&s;iderable
time, the frequency of its return would
take up mo&s;t of their lei&s;ure, and there|by
be a &s;en&s;ible impediment to their
Temporal Vocations.</P>

In the clo&s;ure of this Chapter, I
thought to have &s;poken &s;omething of the
<HI>More&s;co</HI> Mu&s;ick in the <HI>Mo&s;ch,</HI> but this I
found to be a delightful piece of Devo|tion,
wherein they &s;eem to be very igno|rant.
I have been told, that in former

needs be very har&s;h Harmony, if any at
all, in regard of the incapacity that is
in the <HI>Alcoran</HI> Language to fall into Syl|labical
Mea&s;ures and Tuneable Propor|tions.
Be&s;ides, the <HI>Moors</HI> have very
har&s;h and &s;awing Voices, as they will

<P>SOme have laid it down for a great

vi&s;ible in the Grand <HI>Seignior</HI> and the

and the other a <HI>Mustard-Dini</HI> to in&s;pect
the Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Affairs, and to be as
the Oracular Interpreters of the <HI>Mahu|medan</HI>
Law, yet their Election is incom|municably
in them&s;elves. And albeit
that the&s;e Principal Church-men are had
in &s;o great e&s;teem with their Princes,
that their Deci&s;ions are &s;carce ever con|tradicted
<PB N="156" REF="87">
by them, yet when their De|terminations
are not con&s;i&s;tent with the
Intere&s;t of the Publick, the&s;e great O|racles
are di&s;mi&s;t, and others introduc'd,
who are not &s;o &s;crupulous in their Sen|tences.
By which it is evident, that the
<HI>Mahumedan</HI> Princes are in effect the
Heads of the Church, and chief Expo|&s;itors
of Religion. But not much of
this can be ob&s;erved in the <HI>Moors</HI> Church-Government,
who have in every <HI>Cav&iacute;la</HI>
(or County) an <HI>Alcalib,</HI> or High-Prie&s;t,
in who&s;e nomination the &s;ecular Power
doth not at all interpo&s;e, for he is cho|&s;en
out of, and by the <HI>Alfaq&ugrave;is,</HI> over
whom he is inve&s;ted with a Power, where|by
he is enabled to Depo&s;e, or otherwi&s;e
Cha&s;ti&s;e the Offending Clergy. Imme|diately
upon this Arch-Prie&s;ts Election,
he is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma Gheber,</HI> or
Great Church: Wherein upon every
Friday he Expounds &s;ome Text of the
<HI>Alchoran,</HI> unto which Exerci&s;e he always
goes accompanyed with the chief Per|&s;onages
of the Neighborhood. And being
enter'd the Church, he immediatly a&s;|cends
the <HI>Albamb&aacute;r</HI> (which is a Bench a|bout
five &s;teps from the Ground) with a
<PB N="157" REF="87">
tall Staff in his Hand, wherewith he of|ten
beats upon the Bench to expre&s;s his
Zeal, and to awaken the People to a
more &s;ignal attention to what he then
delivers. This Di&s;cour&s;e, Homily, Ex|po&s;ition,
or Sermon, exceeds not an hour
and a quarter in length, and is deliver'd
exactly by heart. And when it is end|ed,
the <HI>Almuden</HI> di&s;&s;olves the Congrega|tion,
and the <HI>Alcalib</HI> returns to his Hou&s;e
accompanyed with the chief of the place,
and in his pa&s;&s;age he receives the cu&s;tom|ary
Tokens of re&s;pect from the People.
And whatever &s;ome Cur&s;ory Review of
this Countrey tell us of the other Prie&s;ts
making Sermons to the People, yet ha|ving
with &s;ome diligence made enquiry
into this particular, I found that the Of|fice
of Preaching was peculiar to the <HI>Al|calib,</HI>
or Chief-Prie&s;t, and that no Ser|mons
were celebrated at any other
Church, but at the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma Gheber</HI> (that
which I may Engli&s;h the Cathedral.)
This eminent Church-man is &s;eldom &s;een
in Publick, but at this Exerci&s;e; for to
make him&s;elf the more Reverenced he
affects retirement, &s;pending his hours in
the &s;tudy of the <HI>Alchoran,</HI> and in re&s;ol|ving
<PB N="158" REF="88">
&s;uch Ca&s;es as the Layity pre&s;ent
him, who e&s;teem his Re&s;olutions infalli|ble.
And this, with a careful In&s;pection
into the deportment of the Inferior
Clergy, doth con&s;titute the Office and
Government of the <HI>Alcalib.</HI> As for his
Revenues, they are &s;uitable to his con|dition:
and as to his Life, it is au&s;tere
and re&s;erv'd, he affecting a peculiar Gra|vity
in all his carriage. Every <HI>Alcalib</HI>
has his di&s;tinct Dioce&s;s, out of which
he has no power, &s;o that the <HI>Alcalib</HI> of
<HI>Beni-Ar&oacute;s</HI> hath nothing to do in <HI>Mink&eacute;l,</HI>
for every one is ab&s;olute in his own <HI>Ca|v&iacute;la.</HI></P>
<P>At the publick In&s;tructions of the <HI>Gi|&aacute;mma,</HI>
none are pre&s;ent but the Males,
for the Women, as I &s;aid, are denyed
admi&s;&s;ion into the A&s;&s;embly, yet are not
wholy de&s;titute of the means of being
taught Religion: for upon every Friday
they repair to the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Alfaqu&iacute;,</HI>
where his Wife is bound to In&s;truct
them: But her Lectures u&s;ually concern
good Hou&s;wifry, and how they &s;hould
demean them&s;elves to their Husbands, in
Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion, and to live
in Peace with their Fellow-wives. All
<PB N="159" REF="88">
the while the Women are at the Prie&s;ts
Hou&s;e, he is not to return home, nor
&s;tir out of the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma,</HI> but hath his
Meat brought him thither. But for what
rea&s;on the Prie&s;t &s;hould be under this re|&s;traint,
I leave any one to imagine, who
has heard of the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Jealou&s;ie. But
now in ca&s;e the Prie&s;t has no Wife, who
&s;eldom wants four; or that by any In|di&s;po&s;ition
&s;he is not able to perform this
Office, then it is di&s;charged by &s;ome
aged Matron of the place: and for a fur|ther
&s;upplement of the Womens being
debarr'd of the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma,</HI> their Husbands
repeat unto them &s;uch Le&s;&s;ons as they
have heard there. And this is all that
on this account I could ob&s;erve of the
<HI>Moors</HI> Women.</P>
<P><HI>Muley Mahumed</HI> &s;tyled Prayer the Key
of Paradi&s;e, and the Pillar of Religion,
that he might the better recommend its
practice to his Converts, who generally
maintain &s;o careful a performance of this
Duty, that no &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s can detain
them from, nor any thing divert them at
their Devotion. I once endeavor'd to
collect their Prayers into an Order, the
better to take a di&s;tinct view of this Pil|lar
<PB N="160" REF="89">
of their Religion, but I found them
reduced to no certain Form extracted
out of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> but were a Collecti|on
of &s;ome incoherent Sentences mag|nifying
the Power and Mercy of God.
Their fir&s;t Prayer, or rather their Creed,
is that which the <HI>Almuden</HI> Proclaims with
a loud voice, when he calls the People to
the <HI>Mo&s;ch;</HI> as there is but one God, and
<HI>Mahumed</HI> his Me&s;&s;enger: and this admits
of no variation. The &s;econd Prayer is
the fir&s;t Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> where|in
there is &s;ome difference according to
Tran&s;lations (in which the <HI>Alcoran</HI> hath
been very unhappy) but tho&s;e which I
have &s;een in <HI>Latin, Spani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>French,</HI>
agree in this Traduction of the Cha|pter.</P>
<P><HI>In the Name of God, Gracious and Mer|ciful,
King of the Day of Judgment: thou
art He whom we adore: it is from Thee
that we require help: guide us in the right
way, in the way of tho&s;e with whom Thou
art plea&s;ed, against whom Thou art not
angry, and we &s;hall not go astray.</HI> This
Prayer is repeated with the former, af|ter
the &s;ame manner as the Papi&s;ts re|peat
their <HI>Pater noster</HI> with the <HI>Ave Ma|ria:</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="89">
For the <HI>Moors</HI> have their <HI>Te&s;&s;erae
Precariae,</HI> or their Beads, wherewith
they number their Prayers. And the
whole <HI>Corona</HI> or <HI>Ro&s;ary</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of nine|ty
eight, which the <HI>Devoti,</HI> or Religi|ou&s;ly
affected, carry always about them.
They have a Cu&s;tom to repeat often to|gether
the fir&s;t Words of the Prayer,
which they conclude to be a great act of
Charity, as &s;upplying by this Repetition
the defaults of &s;uch as are remi&s;s in this
duty.</P>
<P><HI>In the Name of God, Merciful and Gra|cious,</HI>
is the Proeme of every Chapter in
the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and were the fir&s;t Words
that <HI>Mahumed</HI> is &s;aid to have &s;poken
when he came out of his <HI>Epileptick</HI> Fits,
which he made the People believe were
Trances. And with the &s;ame Words
the <HI>Mahumedan</HI> Doctors begin all their
Di&s;cour&s;es, and the Letters written in
<HI>More&s;co</HI> Language, if the Pen-men are
preci&s;e, are likewi&s;e introduced in the
&s;ame Form. There is a Learned Man,
that tells of a Prayer among the <HI>Mahu|medans,</HI>
which is called, <HI>The Prayer of
Je&s;us the Son of Mary,</HI> ending thus, <HI>And
let not &s;uch an one bear rule over me, that
<PB N="162" REF="90">
will have no pity upon me, for thy mercy
&s;ake, O thou most merciful.</HI> But having
diligently enquired, I could not find
that the pre&s;ent <HI>Moors</HI> have any &s;uch Le|tany
in their U&s;es. There are few who
are able to read, that want Manuals of
Private Devotions, which are compo&s;ed
by the <HI>Morabito</HI>'s or <HI>Morabouts,</HI> and are
indeed rather to be termed Charms, then
Prayers. Now the&s;e <HI>Morabito</HI>'s or <HI>Mo|rabouts,</HI>
are a &s;ort of <HI>Al&aacute;rbes</HI> which are
skilled, or &s;o pretend to be, in the Law
of <HI>Mahumed,</HI> &s;evere in their Conver&s;a|tion,
bearing a great o&s;tentation of San|ctity,
pretending to Prophe&s;ie, or Pre|dictions.
They compo&s;e all &s;orts of
Charms, to which the <HI>Moor</HI> is &s;o addict|ed,
that he has one for every occa&s;ion:
I have &s;een a whole Book thereof, con|taining
&s;ome for the Child-bearing Wo|men,
to facilitate their Travel; &s;ome
for the Pa&s;&s;enger, to guide him in the
way; &s;ome for the Soldier; and one
for the Hor&s;e, which is much in the Ser|vice
of the Saddle: This they hang un|der
the Bea&s;ts Neck, and believe that it
keeps him from being blind, or dim|&s;ighted.
They have likewi&s;e Spells to
<PB N="163" REF="90">
keep their Cattel healthy, and make
them fruitfnl, all compos'd by the <HI>Mo|rabouts</HI>
and Prie&s;ts; the latter, of late,
being much given to this &s;ort of Compo|&s;ures.</P>
<P>And now from the&s;e &s;hort Notices of
the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma</HI> and its Appendages, I pa&s;s
to &s;peak of the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Sabbaoth. That
the fifth day of the Week, is the Weekly
Fe&s;tival of the <HI>Mahumedans,</HI> to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
them from the <HI>Jew,</HI> who keeps the
&s;ixth according to our account, and from
the Chri&s;tian who ob&s;erves the &s;e|venth,
is known unto every one that
knows any thing of this &s;ubject. About
the In&s;titution of this Sabbaoth, varie|ty
of Opinions may be met with: For
&s;ome derive its Original from the vene|ration
<HI>Mahumed</HI> bore to the New Moon,
which is &s;aid to have appeared on Fri|day,
the &s;ame day he began his Impo|&s;ture;
and in memory of &s;o happy an
abodement, he &s;et apart this for Solemn
Wor&s;hip. There is another Conjecture
which fetcheth its In&s;titution from &s;ome
Heathen Rites paid on this day to <HI>Ve|nus,</HI>
who&s;e name Friday bears. But
there is little ground of this Opinion,
<PB N="164" REF="91">
further then it may well &s;uit with the
Genius of <HI>Mahumedi&s;m,</HI> to have a day
Sacred to the Godde&s;s of Carnality. But
that Opinion herein &s;eems be&s;t to agree
with the Chronicles of <HI>Mahumed,</HI> which
makes his e&s;cape from the Con&s;piracy
of the Nobles of <HI>Mecha,</HI> to have been
the occa&s;ion of this Sabbaoth, from
which deliverance the <HI>Mahumedan Hegi|ra</HI>
had its Original and Name. And in
this <HI>Mahumed</HI> undoubtedly imitated the
Ancient Chri&s;tians, who took their <HI>Ae|ra</HI>'s
from &s;ome notable Per&s;ecutions.
But whatever was the Original of this
Sabbaoth, I ob&s;erv'd that it has no great
marks of Reverence above other days:
for on it the <HI>Moors</HI> go to Plough, hold
their Markets, open Shops, and omit
little of their Ordinaries, &s;o that I mu&s;t
retract my calling of it a Sabbaoth.</P>
<P>They indeed on this day have an Ex|po&s;ition
at the <HI>Gi&aacute;mma Gheber,</HI> and on
it they put on their white&s;t <HI>Alheics,</HI> dre&s;s
their Locks, and are &s;een in their be&s;t
Accoutrements. The Women likewi&s;e
on this day vi&s;it the Sepulchres, and
and &s;trew the Graves of their decea&s;ed
Friends with green Boughes and Herbs.

<P>IN the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Catalogue of Crimes,
Adultery and Fornication, are found
in the fir&s;t Comma, who&s;e difference in
the Moors Opinion may be collected
from their Penalties. For Adultery, it
<PB N="172" REF="95">
is allways Capital, in&s;omuch that with|out
regard of any Eminence or Quality,
the Convict thereof is certainly &s;ton'd
to Death, which is done with mo&s;t
notorious Circum&s;tances. For fir&s;t the
day of Execution is publi&s;hed, then the
Criminal is brought to the <HI>Calvary,</HI>
where bury'd up to the navel in a <HI>Mat
M&oacute;ra,</HI> or a pit digged for that purpo&s;e,
every one pre&s;ent ca&s;ts one &s;tone, and
no more, at him, &s;aying, this is for thy

the Adulterous be Per&s;ons of Condi|tion,
their Friends have Licence to di&s;|patch
them privily, to prevent the o|pen
reproach to their family.</P>
<P>In the puni&s;hing Fornication they
are le&s;s Rigorous, as finding the mi&s;|chief
thereof not to be of &s;o large a de|rivation,
as that of Adultery. And if
the Per&s;ons convict of this Uncha&s;tity
are in the &s;tate of <HI>Coelibate,</HI> they are on|ly
Cha&s;tis'd with Scourges: but if either
be married, or under matrimonial con|tract,
Death is the certain penance. But
the Moors are no le&s;s &s;olemn in whip|ping
the Fornicator, than in Stoning
the Adulterer. For on Friday, after
<PB N="173" REF="95">

the Offender, if a man, is placed at the

Church, naked down to the mid|dle,
and in the pre&s;ence of the Congre|gation
receives an hundred &s;tripes on his
back from an Officer appointed for that
Purpo&s;e, who has a certain number of
<HI>Blank&eacute;les</HI> (or <HI>More&s;co</HI> twopences,) for his

woman who hath been partner in the

man, becau&s;e the Moors &s;uppo&s;e the Fe|male
to be of a predominant allure|ment
in &s;uch unclean commixtures.</P>
<P>The Moors who live in a Roaving
condition are much addicted to Thieve|ry,
again&s;t which the <HI>Alcadd&eacute;e</HI> proceeds
by the&s;e &s;teps of puni&s;hment; for the
fir&s;t Theft the Convict is publickly
whipt in the <HI>Al&s;&oacute;uck</HI> or Market; for the
&s;econd, he loo&s;eth his hand; for the
third theft he may truly be &s;aid to dye
<PB N="174" REF="96">
<HI>without mercy.</HI> For the Moors ob&s;erve
<HI>Caligula</HI>'s Severity in making the Of|fender
exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible of his death,
which they inflict. Again&s;t the day of
the Theif<HI>'s</HI> Execution, the Youth of the
Place are advertis'd to prepare their
In&s;truments of blood, which are little
dry Canes, made in the fa&s;hion of darts,
accurately &s;harp pointed, the&s;e they
hurle at the naked body of the Malefa|ctor,
till his whole skin be &s;truck ther|with
full of holes, and when they find
him &s;inking under the torture, they
dragg and hang him up by the heels up|on
a gate, or the like, where he breaths
out his la&s;t in torments, and being dead
he is loath&s;omly expo&s;ed to the birds of
prey.</P>
<P>In bodily injuries they ob&s;erve the
law of Retaliation, as an Eye for an Eye,
a tooth for a tooth, &amp;c. but it is in the
power of the maimed party to Receive
a pecuniary reparation, or without any
&s;atisfaction to remit the wrong; but this
is not permitted til the matter hath been
tryed before the <HI>Alcadd&eacute;e,</HI> and the hurt
party publickly declared, that he is wil|ling
either freely to forgive the injury,
<PB N="175" REF="96">
or to accept &s;o much money in full Re|paire.</P>
<P>And however the Municipal Laws of
&s;ome Countreys put a va&s;t difference
between murder and man-&s;laughter,
as appeares in their defin'd puni&s;h|ments,
yet in <HI>Barbary</HI> all homicide, or
killing of a man by a man, is Capitall.</P>
<P>And the Moors have herein two con|ce&s;&s;ions.
The one is to Licence the next
kindred of the &s;lain, to take money for
his blood of him that &s;pilt it. The o|ther
to permit the Relations of the mur|dered
to kill the murderer, without a|ny
judicial proceedure, if he be not al|ready
in &s;afe cu&s;tody; which is no more
then a pur&s;uance of that Po&s;ition, Re|venge
is no &s;inne. Of this there happen|ed
a famous In&s;tance, not many months
before I left <HI>Barbary,</HI> an account where|of,
as it was given me by my old freind
<HI>Cidi Alli Mulud Ben Ali,</HI> take as follows.</P>
<P>A Moor of <HI>Targa</HI> not far from <HI>Titu&agrave;n</HI>
having his Brother treacherou&s;ly mur|der'd
by one of the Voi&s;inage, under|took
to pur&s;ue the fugitive murderer,
with de&s;igne to avenge his Relations
blood, and coming to <HI>Alcazer Gheber,</HI>
<PB N="176" REF="97">
he was inform'd that the Per&s;on he &s;ought
for had &s;ome days before been there,
and that he had put on a Pilgrims habit,
with full re&s;olution to pay a holy jour|ny
to <HI>Mech&agrave;;</HI> upon which the Pur&s;uer
put on the like habit, and in pro&s;ecu|tion
of his de&s;ign purpo&s;ed to per|forme
the &s;ame pilgrimage; bnt being
come to <HI>Morocco,</HI> he overtook &amp; lodg'd
with the murderer in the Pilgrims ho&s;|pital,
where early the next morning he
&s;lew him; whereupon being apprehen|ded
and examin'd upon the fre&s;h cir|cum&s;tances
of the fact, he produced a
Certificate under the hand of the <HI>Alcad|d&eacute;e</HI>
of the place where he liv'd, that his
Brother was &s;lain, and that he had un|dertaken
to avenge his death, the mur|derer
being fled, and likewi&s;e an&s;wered
them, that that was the Homicide whom
he had killed, whereupon he was &s;et at
liberty, and the Corps left to his di&s;|po&s;al,
to which giving a decent Inter|ment,
he returned home to receive the
prai&s;es of his Gallantry.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Alcadd&eacute;e,</HI> whom I
&s;hall here only ob&s;erve in his Revenue,
and office; as to the former it is very
<PB N="177" REF="97">
con&s;iderable, for he &s;igns not a paper
without a Fee; and as to the latter, it is
very honourable, and careful, for all ci|vil
affaires pa&s;s through his hands, and
he dayly &s;itts attending on all qualities
of per&s;ons without varying his re&s;pect
to any. If he be corrupt in his Charge,
the <HI>Alcadd&eacute;e Gueber,</HI> upon mature convi|ction
turns him out of Office, which is
his extreme&s;t penalty.</P>
<P>But indeed the Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice
have no opportunity to be Collu&s;ive, as
being free from the great allurement of
dealing fal&s;ly, for Bribery is not known
among&s;t them. U&s;ury which (I promi|&s;ed
to intimate in this Chapter) is tota|ly
forbidden by their Law, for <HI>Mahumed</HI>
hath made it an irremi&s;&s;able &s;inne, and
the U&s;erer in as bad a condition as the
Divell, leaving him neither will, nor
hope to be &s;aved.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of
the Law, and the &s;uppo&s;ition of this
Crime, the Moors have a Cu&s;tom
which much favours it; for he that bor|rows
mony of another wherewith to
trafique and gain, gives the lender an e|qual
&s;hare of the Profits, and in ca&s;e the
<PB N="178" REF="98">
borrower lo&s;e the whole Principal, he
is obliged to make it good to him that
lends it, but if only part be lo&s;t, the re|mainder
is employ'd to regain it. And
it is u&s;ual with the lender to forbear the
Borrower, till he perceives him fraudu|lent,
Carele&s;s, or Unfortunate.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the &s;inne of U&s;ury is &s;o
notorious among the Jews, the Moors
believe that for it they are oppre&s;&s;ed of
God, and live Exiles from their own <HI>Ca|naan.</HI>
But it is ea&s;y to ob&s;erve a &s;ort
of Antipathie between the&s;e people, not|with&s;tanding
that they are conjoyned
in neighbourhood, commerce, &amp; in very
many rites both civil and Religious. But
the contempt is reciprocal, for if the
Moor by way of Proverb &s;ay, <HI>As deceit|ful
as a Jew,</HI> the <HI>Jew</HI> repayes, as <HI>uvbe|lieving
as a Moor.</HI> And this enmity I
remarked in a <HI>Barab&aacute;r</HI> of my Acquain|tance,
who ob&s;erving the Jews very much
frequent my lodging, he very roundly
reprov'd that Conver&s;ation, and angri|ly
told me, That the Jews were born
to cheat both the Moor and the Chri|&s;tian,
that he was a&s;&s;ured that they were
not de&s;cended of <HI>Adam,</HI> but that they
<PB N="179" REF="98">
were breed of the bone of a dead bea&s;t,
and when he conjectured my incredulity
of his ridiculous Story, by my &s;miling
thereat, he told me in angry zeal, that
he would pledge his head for the truth
of his A&s;&s;ertion; whereupon I demand|ing
what he conceived of tho&s;e Jews who
turned Moors, he an&s;wer'd, that there
was &s;uch efficacy in their religion, that it
made all tho&s;e good who embraced it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The More&s;co opinion of Marriage,

<P>THat marriage is honorable among
all men, if it were not a truth dropt
from an in&s;pired Pen, might be proved
by Induction, and the oecumenical con|&s;ent
of all Nations, which pretend to
any &s;etled Rites in Religion or Policy.
As for <HI>Mahumed,</HI> he had matrimony in &s;o
peculiar an e&s;timation, that he made it
the &s;econd of his eight Precepts, and
<PB N="180" REF="99">
enjoyn'd every Subject of his Law to
marry in the Vigor of his Age, making
the predominant end thereof, the Pro|pagation
and maintenance of his Sect.
He likewi&s;e told them that cha&s;t celibate
was impo&s;&s;ible, and that tho&s;e who pre|tended
to live therin, were ju&s;tly to be
&s;u&s;pected for unclean conver&s;ation. And
hence perhaps it comes to pa&s;s, that
the Moors (who are the Puritans in
Mahumeti&s;m,) are &s;o generally ob&s;ervant
of this commandment; for few among
them are found to live out of the &s;tate of
Wedlock, if they are able to purcha&s;e
a wife. But many are not very prone
to take all the liberty in marrying indul|ged
them by their Prophet; for albeit
he permits them plurality of wives, yet
there are &s;everal families that for many
ages have confin'd them&s;elves to one: &amp;
I have met with tho&s;e who abhor that
filthy po&s;ition father'd upon <HI>Muhumed,
That the more they are &s;piritual, the more
liberty and abilities they have to be car|nal.</HI></P>
<P>Unto the per&s;ons that are to be mar|ried
there is no conver&s;ation permitted
till the Knot be tyed, &s;o that both par|ties
<PB N="181" REF="99">
take one the other upon tru&s;t, and
the man perchance never &s;ees the wo|man
till they be brought to the bride-chamber;
A cu&s;tom that would be ve|ry
hardly di&s;ge&s;ted by the Utopians,
who think it very unrea&s;onable that a
man &s;hould take a wife with le&s;s &s;cru|tiny
than he doth his hor&s;e, and that he
&s;hould bring one to be the perpetual
partner of his life, with le&s;s informa|tion
than he doth a hor&s;e to his &s;table,
which he may part with the next day.</P>
<P>But the Contriver of the New <HI>Atlan|tis</HI>
findes all the&s;e inconveniences avoi|dable
by the cu&s;tom of <HI>Ben&s;alem:</HI> where
(&s;aith he) neare every Town there
is a couple of Pooles (which they call
<HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eves</HI> Pooles;) in the&s;e it is
permitted to one of the Friends of the
man, another of the woman, to &s;ee them
&s;everally both naked. And the Moors
have a cu&s;tom not much differing from
this of <HI>Ben&s;alem,</HI> for upon the de&s;ign of
marriage two of the man's Female
friends, who have lived long enough in
wedlock to under&s;tand its <HI>Perqui&s;ites,</HI>
are appointed to view the intended
Bride, and to give the Suitor an account
<PB N="182" REF="100">
of her bodily accompli&s;hments, and de|fects,
which is exactly entered in the
Contract, and if any infirmity be con|cealed
for which the husband afterward
di&s;liks her, he may put her away; and
this makes them very cautious to omit
nothing in the &s;earch or report; But
there is no &s;uch examination pa&s;&s;ed up|on
the man, becau&s;e he is dayly expo|&s;ed
to a free Cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>If this Inqui&s;ition be pa&s;s'd with &s;a|tisfaction,
then they proceed to frame
the Articles of Marriage, which is al|waies
done by the neare&s;t Freinds or
Relations of the Parties to be contract|ed.
And when they have fini&s;hed them,
they are brought to the <HI>Alcadd&eacute;e</HI> to be
confirm'd under his hand and Seal; for
unle&s;s the bargain be thus ratified, the
woman in ca&s;e of her husband's death,
or her own divorce, cannot recover the
Portion that was promi&s;ed her, or ra|ther
the price that was to be pay'd for
her by the man; For I &s;uppo&s;e that
few are ignorant of the <HI>More&s;co</HI> Cu&s;tom
of buying their wives; When the Paper
containing the Bargain has pa&s;&s;ed the
<HI>Alcadd&eacute;e,</HI> it is carried to the <HI>Alfaqu&igrave;,</HI> who
<PB N="183" REF="100">
having peru&s;ed and declared his ap|probation
of its Contents, he bids
the Man take home the Woman when he
plea&s;eth to be his Wife; and this is all
that is done by the Prie&s;t in this, ac|cording
to their E&s;timate.</P>
<P>And after this &s;hort di&s;patch of Woo|ing,
Contract, and Marriage, the Bride-Grooms
next con&s;ultation is with his
own convenience in order to fetch
home his Bride: in which the warm
Clime &s;uffers him not to be tedious. But
herein he is obliged to ob&s;erve the ap|pointed
Times; for neither all Weeks
in the Year, nor all Days in the Week,
nor all hours in the Day, are free for
this Solemnity. For the taking home
the Bride is altogether prohibited du|ring
their <HI>Ramad&agrave;n,</HI> or Lent: The like,
Prohibition reacheth unto the Tue&s;days,
Wedne&s;days, and Fridays of every Week,
and on the Canonical or Regular Days,
the Afternoon and Evening are the ac|cu&s;tomary
Hours. At the time when
Marriage is Celebrated, they u&s;e all po&s;|&s;ible
&s;ignifications of Joy and Ho&s;pita|lity;
and it is the Cu&s;tom for the Friends
of the Marryed to contribute &s;omething
<PB N="184" REF="101">
to grace their Nuptials. Therefore if
the Marryed Pair live both in the &s;ame
Town, then at their &s;et time the Bride|groom
goes attended with his neare&s;t
Kindred, who coming to the Lodgings
of the Bride are not &s;uffer'd to go in,
but wait at the Door till the <HI>Negra</HI>'s,
which the Husband hath bought or bor|rowed
for that day, bring the Bride
from her Chamber under a Canopy of
<HI>Alh&eacute;icks,</HI> and place her in an <HI>Almaria,</HI>
or clo&s;e Chair (much re&s;embling a Tub)
which they cover with Scarfs and Ri|bons.
And in this manner &s;he is born
through the Streets by Chri&s;tians that
are Captives, and for want of the&s;e by
<HI>Negra</HI>'s, or by a meaner &s;ort of <HI>Whites.</HI>
When they begin their March from the
Brides Hou&s;e to the Bridegrooms, the
Mu&s;ick, Colours, and Drums pa&s;s in the
fir&s;t rank; next to them go &s;ome anci|ent
Women, who have been a long &s;pace
Marryed, all clo&s;ely veil'd: immediate
next after the <HI>Almaria,</HI> or Bride-Chair,
march tho&s;e who carry the Clothes and
Pre&s;ents of the Bride, which have been
made her by her Friends, who follow
immediatly after in a regular di&s;po&s;i|tion.
<PB N="185" REF="101">
When they are come to the Bride|grooms,
the Chair being lighted, the
<HI>Negra</HI>'s take out the Bride, and under
a Canopy of <HI>Alheicks</HI> conduct her to
her Apartment, where &s;he is received
by &s;ome aged Matrons, who in&s;truct her
in the important Offices of a good Wife,
and the rules of that Relation, but they
are wary of betraying any di&s;couraging
Severity, and therefore intermit their
Documents by ta&s;ting the good Cheer
provided for their Entertainment. While

<P>In the interim of this Entertainment,

And this continues till all the Batchelors
have been at the <HI>Corban.</HI> About eight
of the Clock the Company breaks up,
with re&s;olution to rea&s;&s;emble the next

undre&s;&s;es with his own Hands, fir&s;t ta|king

her Drawers, and in every point pre|pares

For about Mid-night he leaves his Bride

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the More&s;co Polygamy, Concu|binage,
Divorce, for what rea&s;ons,
in what ca&s;es it is allowed.</HEAD>
<P>THat the <HI>Muley Mahumed</HI> might the
better complea&s;e the loo&s;e humors
of his fir&s;t Sectaries, he made his Reli|gion
to contain many carnal indulgen|ces,
denying nothing to Believers of his
Doctrin, that had any &s;en&s;ible comply|ance
with their brutal affections. And
of this we meet with an Example in his
conce&s;&s;ion of Polygamie and concubi|nage;
for fir&s;t he granted to every Pro|fe&s;&s;or
of his Religion the liberty of mar|rying
four wives; he likewi&s;e taught
that they might take as many Concu|bines
as they were able to maintain, but
in this al&s;o the more illuminated Moors
confine them&s;elves to one of their own
Per&s;wa&s;ion, e&s;teeming Concubinate with
Infidels (under which name all are com|prized
<PB N="190" REF="104">
that profe&s;s not <HI>Mahumati&s;m)</HI>
to be an unexorable uncleanne&s;s. As
for Polygamy it is looked upon as a Di|vine
In&s;titute, and when any object a|gain&s;t
it, the Moors vindicate it by the
frequent examples and univer&s;al cu&s;|tomes
thereof, in the Patriarchs and
worthies of the Hebrew world. And
I could meet with none who a&s;&s;erted Plu|rality
of wives upon politick con&s;ide|rations,
as that it was coveinent for the
propagation of the Empire, encrea&s;e of
people, and enlargement of their Re|ligion:
but that it proceeded from God,
was u&s;ed by the Holie&s;t of his Servants,
and the oeconomy of the Old Law.</P>
<P>When the inconvenience of the&s;e Plu|ralitie
is objected, and that their Oeco|nomicks
cannot but be much di&s;order'd
by rea&s;on of the inquietudes, and &s;trifes
that will inevitably ari&s;e among &s;o many
female corrivals for one man's affection;
they tell you that this is a di&s;ea&s;e who&s;e
remedy is of a very ea&s;y procurement,
by rea&s;on of that ab&s;olute Dominion,
which the husband hath over his wives,
whom, if they prove di&s;agreeing, he con|fines
to their &s;everal apartments, with|out
<PB N="191" REF="104">
allowing them any further conver&s;a|tion
among them&s;elves, then that their
&s;ociety at meales affords them. And if
this will not cure the unpeaceable hu|mour,
then Divorce proves an infalli|ble
Receit; of which give me leave to
give this briefe account.</P>
<P>When the woman findes her&s;elf aggrie|ved
by her husband, or any of her fellow-wives,
her only reparation and &s;uccour
is to &s;eek a divorce. And in this ca&s;e &s;he
has liberty to addre&s;s her &s;elf to the <HI>Al|caddee,</HI>
who has the &s;ole power of di&s;&s;olv|ing,
as well as of tying, the knot of ma|trimony.
And when the woman has de|clard
her condition, and &s;pread before
the <HI>Alcaddee</HI> the rea&s;ons upon which &s;he
grounds her de&s;ire of Divorce, the <HI>Al|caddee</HI>
pre&s;ently &s;ends for the husband, &amp;
examines him concerning the verity of
the complaint brought again&s;t him by his
wife, if he deny it, then the matter is
decided by the voice of the Neighbours,
but if the husband have a willingne&s;s to
be quit of his wife, then he needs but
confe&s;s that whereof he is accu&s;ed, and
the <HI>Alcaddee</HI> teares in pieces the Bill of
their marriage which he had Confirm'd,
<PB N="192" REF="105">
declares the Marriage void, and certifies
the Divorce under his Seal; and from
hence forward they are both at liberty
for new nuptials. From which the wo|man
is bound to ab&s;tain till it be appa|rent
that &s;he is not impregnate by her la&s;t
husband, who is &s;till obliged, to provide
for the i&s;&s;ue that &s;he &s;hall bring into the
world five months after the Divorce.
But if &s;he cannot tarry &s;o long, then the
<HI>Alcabla,</HI> or Midwife, has her in Exa|mination,
who is bound to return a ju&s;t
&amp; true report upon pain of being &s;toned
to death. The Moors call the Divorce
and widdows by the &s;ame word, and en|joyn
them the &s;ame Laws of &s;econd mar|riage.</P>
<P>The chief cau&s;es of Divorce on the
womans part or either di&s;quiet and fro|ward
carriage to the Family, e&s;pecially
when &s;he will not live in amicable &s;ocie|ty
with the Sharers of the &s;ame Bed: or
when &s;he is unplea&s;ing to her conjugal
embraces, or when &s;he will not indure
his familiarity with his women &s;laves.
But if &s;he be found guilty of adultery,
the injurie is too great for Divorce to re|pair
and in this Ca&s;e &s;he is &s;olely left to
<PB N="193" REF="105">
the plea&s;ure of her husband, who has
Ab&s;olute power both to be her Judge
and Executioner. And albeit the Moors
are not &s;paring in the revenge of their
kinreds death, yet they applaud the
husband who kils their kin&s;women,
whom he has certainly found treache|rous
to his Bed.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ions of Divorce on the hu&s;|bands
&s;ide are his refu&s;al of paying his
wife marital Due; or, &s;ome other &s;ort
of unkind deportment. But after all
the wives complaints, the husband is at
liberty to retain or put her away; and
he may at any time divorce his wife in
ca&s;e he will make good the marriage
Contract.</P>
<P>It is u&s;ually &s;aid, that the wives &s;eek
for Divorce when their husbands deal
unnaturally with them; and albeit this
is &s;aid to be done with a great deale of
mode&s;ty, the crime being &s;ignified by
the turning up of a Shooe, yet in <HI>Barba|ry</HI>
examples of this kind are very unu|&s;ual,
for the Moors abhorre the villany,
believing that it is not in man's Nature
to be &s;o prepo&s;terous; and that it
was at fir&s;t the malitious invention of
<PB N="194" REF="106">
&s;ome vile and impudent Strumpet.</P>
<P>The Children which are begot before
Divorce, follow not the woman, but are
left to the husbands charge. And it is
ob&s;ervable that the <HI>More&s;co</HI> women &s;el|dome
prove unfruitful, for in a town of
above twelve hundred married women,
it was reckon'd for a great rarity that
there was one dyed barren. But the
wife, different from the Jewi&s;h cu&s;tom,
&s;uffers no di&s;honour for her Sterility,
and if the husband takes a &s;econd wife
who proves al&s;o childle&s;s, the husband
beares the imputation. <HI>Mahumed</HI> in the
fourth Chap. of his <HI>Alcoran</HI> advi&s;eth the
husband who&s;e wife is barren, to &s;wear
by her belly, and a&s;&s;erts it a means to
make her Conceive. A devotion which
as I have been told is &s;till in u&s;e among
the <HI>Al&aacute;rbes,</HI> but quite worne out of
fa&s;hion with the other Moors.</P>
<P>In the nur&s;ing of Children the mother
abhors that unnatural pride of &s;uckling
them with other bre&s;ts, while her own
are &s;ufficient for that affectionate &s;er|vice.
And to &s;hew that there is &s;ome|thing
more than common kindne&s;s in
this particular, the Empre&s;s her &s;elf is
<PB N="195" REF="106">
obliged for the fir&s;t &s;even days to give
her child &s;uck.</P>
<P>And now before I di&s;mi&s;s this re|mark,
I cannot but acquaint you with
all the material ceremonies, of the &s;e|cond,
third, and fourth marriages. E|very
former wife upon the introduction
of another, lives &s;even days deprived of
all manner of &s;ociety with her husband,
who for that time devotes him&s;elf en|tirely
to his la&s;t Bride; whom on the
&s;eventh day after marriage he &s;olemnly
brings into the acquaintance and fellow|&s;hip
of his other wives, who&s;e brows the
la&s;t married is bound to ki&s;s, and tells
them that they are not to be angry that
their Holy Law hath entitled her to a
&s;hare in his affection as large as any of
theirs. The husband likwi&s;e exhorts
them all to reciprocal kindne&s;&s;es, a&s;|&s;uring
them that without fraud, or any
partiality, he intends to divide him&s;elf
among them.</P>
<P>Now that which &s;eemes mo&s;t nearly
to concern the wives, and proves the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t incentive of their
wrath is their husbands liberty of taking
as many Concubines as he li&s;ts; which for
<PB N="196" REF="107">
the mo&s;t part are Blacks, the Moors
doting much on that Spani&s;h &s;aying <HI>la
Negra tiene, turmentina en ella.</HI> But
tho&s;e that keep Concubine &s;laves, are
not permitted to a&s;&s;ociate with them in
the night, and if any of them bear, their
Patrons Children, &s;he thereupon re|ceives
her liberty, and the Child is co|heir
with tho&s;e begot in Wedlock.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the More&s;co admi&s;sion of Rene|negados,
Circumci&s;ion, Impo&s;ition
of Names, Sur-names.</HEAD>
<P>EVery Religion have had &s;till &s;ome
Rites appropriated to the admi&s;&s;ion
of &s;uch as undertook its profe&s;&s;ion; and
by which they were characterized and
di&s;tingui&s;hed. Concerning this the Au|thor
of <HI>Mahumati&s;m</HI> was much di&s;tract|ed,
not knowing what inaugurating ce|remony
to Ordain. His two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors
<HI>Sergius</HI> the Monk, and <HI>Abdalla</HI> the Jew,
divided him with their opinions, while
each pleaded for the character of his
<PB N="197" REF="107">
for&s;aken Faith. But the wary Impo&s;tor
(labouring to keep up the credit of his
preten&s;ions, in being &s;ent, to be the re|conciler
of the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,
and to compo&s;e a Law compre|hending
both) to comply with <HI>Sergius,</HI>
who &s;tood &s;tifly for Bapti&s;m, he or|dain'd
daily wa&s;hings to all tho&s;e who be|came
<HI>Mahumetans,</HI> &amp; a&s;cribed thereunto
no le&s;s efficacy than the clean&s;ing of the
Soule. And that he might not di&s;gu&s;t
<HI>Abdalla</HI> the Jew, he made Circumci&s;ion
admi&s;&s;ive of Pro&s;elytes into his Law. But
did not in&s;titute it under any notion of
ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, and indi&s;pen&s;ibly re|quired
of all who undertook the Profe&s;|&s;ion
of his Religion, but made the want
of it no impediment of future happine&s;s.
And therefore in the admittance of a Re|negado,
or the denyer of his fir&s;t Reli|gion,
circumci&s;ion is not exacted of the
Moors, for feare that the undergoing
of &s;uch a painful Sacrament &s;hould de|ter
the Pro&s;elyte. But when any de&s;ires
to be of their per&s;wa&s;ion, they carry the
new <HI>Mu&s;ulman</HI> on hor&s;eback, in a kinde of
triumph through the &s;treets, &amp; proclaims
that &s;uch an one being turn'd Moor,
<PB N="198" REF="108">
de&s;ires the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Prayers
that he may not Apo&s;tati&s;e.</P>
<P>But their male children are initiated by
circumci&s;ion, and becau&s;e the child may
die before it can be circumci&s;ed, there|fore
the lack of this Write in &s;uch a ca&s;e
is concluded to be no hindrance of its
enjoyment of Paradi&s;e. When the child
is &s;even days old, the Moors give it a
name, and the Father of it makes a fea&s;t.
But the impo&s;ition of the Name is done
in the publick a&s;&s;embly; for the Father
at the evening-Sallah carries to the
Church &s;everal di&s;hes of Cu&s;cu&s;&s;ow, of
which he &s;ets one apart for the Prie&s;t,
and the re&s;t to be eaten up by the peo|ple.
And when the Prayers are ended,
the congregation demand of the Father
what he will call his Child, and if the
Name he gives it be not &s;atisfactory to
the People, they decide it by lots what
he &s;hall be called, for every man here
has a Vote in the Nameing of his Neigh|bour's
Child. And when they have a|greed
the point, all pray that the child
may Live, prove Rich and Valiant, and
under&s;tand the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> then they eate
up the Cu&s;cu&s;&s;ow and depart. It is ob|&s;ervable
<PB N="199" REF="108">
that the Prie&s;t neither at the
Nameing, nor circumci&s;ion of the child
has any apppropriate office, of which I
could finde no other rea&s;on, unle&s;s the
Moors e&s;timate of the&s;e Ceremonies,
which they never reckon among the e&s;|&s;entials
of Religion.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome who have a&s;&s;erted,
that there is an inevitable time of circum|ci&s;ion
among all the Mahumetans; But
if they had lived in <HI>Barbary,</HI> they might
have le&s;&s;en'd the propo&s;ition, for the
Moors circumci&s;e their children when
they plea&s;e, being by Law not bound up
to any particular day or hour. But
it is generally grown into fa&s;hion, to
circumci&s;e at the Animadver&s;ary Fea&s;t
called <HI>Mulud,</HI> kept in December in me|mory
of <HI>Muley Mahumed.</HI> And few or
none defer the circumci&s;ion of their
Males at the fir&s;t <HI>Mulud</HI> after their nati|vity.
Now there is no per&s;on &s;et apart
for this office, but the child is circum|ci&s;ed
by any that has a gentle and nim|ble
hand, to whom the parent gives a
bountiful reward.</P>
<P>When the Sonnes arrive to a due ma|turity,
they are di&s;po&s;ed of to Vocations,
<PB N="200" REF="109">
among which the Sword is reckon'd the
mo&s;t honourable, as a Priviledge of Pri|mogeniture
belongs to the fir&s;t born.
The re&s;t betake them&s;elves to &s;uch Cal|lings
as be&s;t agree with their inclinati|ons
and Fathers fortunes. Many of
the wealthier &s;ort put their Sonnes to
to be <HI>Talbyes,</HI> that in ca&s;e they be re|duced
to want, they be in capacity to
be received unto the Prie&s;thood and be
maintain'd by the Church.</P>
<P>The Moors have no &s;urnames, which
want they &s;upply by adding to the
Child's name, either the name of &s;ome
remarkable time when it chanced to be
born, as the <HI>Ramadan, Mulud, A&s;hora,</HI>
and the like; or the name of the Fa|ther
by prefixing <HI>Ben,</HI> as <HI>Hader Ben Ab|dalla:</HI>
being the &s;ame with <HI>Thomas Fits
Williams, &amp;c.</HI> and the higher they de|rive
the pedegree by reckoning up their
Ance&s;tors, it is accounted the mo&s;t ho|nourable.
And in this they follow the
ancient cu&s;tom, for to add to a man's
proper name, the proper name of
his Father by putting [Son] before
it, was of old in &s;tead of that, which we
now call &s;urnames: and in &s;ome parts
<PB N="201" REF="109">
this is not yet worn quite out of u&s;e.
Whether the names now given by the
Moors, are &s;ignificative of any Virtues

them, to be in the Children, hath not
yet fal'n under my comprehen&s;ion.</P>

any thing that is very white about
them, which at other times is a chief part
of their bravery: for they account white
to be no le&s;s a token of chearfulne&s;s
then Innocency, and therefore account
the wearing thereof very improper
<PB N="204" REF="111">
for &s;uch &s;orrowful occa&s;ions. The Men
likewi&s;e (that are of near Alliance to the
Dead) cut not their Beards, but declare
their pen&s;ivene&s;s; they &s;uffer a great
neglect in all tho&s;e Accoutrements, in
which at other times they are very cu|rious;
and by a peculiar Fan&s;ie they
have &s;ome Hairs hanging over their Eyes
in token of a carele&s;s Sorrow. But this
is done chiefly for &s;uch as come to un|timely
ends.</P>
<P>The Women are very loud and dolor|ous
in their Lamentations of the de|parted,
and they intermit not to howl
over the Corps while it is in the Hou&s;e,
which is not long, for as foon as the
Breath is expired, the dead Body is
wa&s;ht with Sope and warm Water, by
tho&s;e of the &s;ame Sex with the departed.
Then the Body is wrapt in white Linnen
and laid in a Coffin (though a Coffin is
but the lot of a few) on the right &s;ide,
with the Face toward <HI>Mecha,</HI> in which
po&s;ture it is al&s;o buryed. When the
Corps is carryed out to Burial, the
Prie&s;t goes next unto it, who coming to
the Grave or Sepulchre, prays that the
Sins of the Defunct may be remitted, and
<PB N="205" REF="111">
that he may have a Portion in the pro|mi&s;ed
Delights. Returning home from
the Buryal, they have a Fea&s;t to comfort
tho&s;e of the Family who are not permit|ted
to dre&s;s any thing while the Corps
are in the Hou&s;e: and this con&s;olatory
Fea&s;t is great or &s;mall, according to the
condition of the Dead.</P>
<P>They account it a great unhappine&s;s
for one of their Faith to want a decent
Interment; and therefore if any dye
without an E&s;tate &s;ufficient to di&s;charge
his Funeral Expences, they &s;upply it by
a Neighborly Contribution. Tho&s;e that
are more Wealthy and Honorable have
Sepulchres, which vary both in Materi|als
and Fa&s;hion: For &s;ome are built of
rough Stone, others of cour&s;e Marble,
but the mo&s;t of Brick: Some in form of
a half Moon, others open upon Pillars;
and &s;ome round and clo&s;e, and to be
enter'd by a Door. But the Vulgar lye
in common Graves, cover'd with green
Turf and Boughs. At the Feet and
Head of tho&s;e that are thus Buryed, they
fix large Stones, in which are writ the
Name of the Interr'd, with the Year of
his Age and <HI>Hegira.</HI> As for Epitaphs,
<PB N="206" REF="112">
they are quite worn out of reque&s;t, yet
they were in great e&s;timation of old, as
may be gather'd from that Collection
which <HI>John Leo</HI> made thereof, and pre|&s;ented
it to a Brother of a King of
<HI>Fez.</HI></P>
<P>Upon every Friday the Women repair
to the Graves of their decea&s;ed Friends,
who&s;e deaths they bewail with a very
loud and bitter Lamentation, recount|ing
the great Satisfaction and Plea&s;ure
which they once enjoy'd in their Socie|ty.
And becau&s;e they believe that on
every Friday the Soul returns to the
Body, they &s;pread the Graves with &s;weet
Flowers and green Boughs on purpo&s;e to
refre&s;h it, and to adorn the Grave. But
there are &s;ome <HI>Moors</HI> which hold this
Rite for a My&s;tery in their Religion,
and therefore pretend not to give any
account of its u&s;age. They have one
thing in Buryal, ob&s;erved no where el&s;e,
which is not to bury another in the &s;ame
Grave where one has been Interr'd be|fore,
and therefore they u&s;e certain
Marks to &s;ecure them from mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>It has been often told me, That the
<HI>More&s;co</HI> Women in their Weekly La|mentations
<PB N="207" REF="112">
of the dead, u&s;e to ask them
what rea&s;on they had to dye, &s;eeing that
they enjoyed loving Friends, wanting
none of the Comforts of this Life, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
But I found this was an idle Story, and a
<HI>Moor</HI> a&s;&s;ured me that they had no &s;uch
Cu&s;tom, and that it could be the Calum|ny
of none but a deceitful Jew.</P>
<P>Neither is that other Story of more
credit, which makes the <HI>Moors</HI> re&s;erve a
vacant Place in the Grave, to give the
dead Carca&s;s room to ri&s;e up and kneel
before two pretty Angels, who come to
confe&s;s the <HI>Departed</HI> concerning the
great Points of the Law; namely, pay|ing
of Tythes, giving of Alms, and ob|&s;erving
of <HI>R&aacute;madon:</HI> for upon mature
Enquiry, I was a&s;&s;ur'd that the <HI>Moors</HI>
had no &s;uch Article in their Creed.</P>
<P>The places of Burial that belong to
great Towns, are in the Fields: but in
the Country they are generally by the
High-ways, which may be to put Pa&s;|&s;engers
in mind of their Mortality. The
Ground which is &s;et apart for this Im|ployment,
is u&s;ually the Donative of
&s;ome devout Per&s;on, or purcha&s;ed with
Legacies bequeath'd for that purpo&s;e.
<PB N="208" REF="113">
And that there might be no fraud pra|cti&s;ed
in this Particular, both <HI>Alfach&iacute;</HI>
and <HI>Alc&aacute;ddee</HI> keep Regi&s;ters of all &s;uch
Donations, which are tran&s;mitted to
Po&s;terity. When the Ground is once
devoted to this &s;ervice, the <HI>Moors</HI> call
it <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> and <HI>Holy,</HI> and accounted its a|lienation
an unpardonable Wickedne&s;s.
Neither the Chri&s;tians, nor any of an|other
Religion, are permitted to tread
within the&s;e Burial Places, unle&s;s they
be their Slaves, whom they admit to any
thing capable of &s;ervice, and u&s;e as &s;ore|ly
as their Dogs. The&s;e Slaves always
wait upon the Women to the Sepulchres,
but for no other intent then to carry
their Flowers and Boughs, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t
them therewith to dre&s;s the Graves.</P>
<P>There is no <HI>Ald&eacute;a</HI> or Village that has
a Church, but it hath al&s;o a peculiar
Burying Place, given or bought as hath
been already mentioned.</P>

have another Fe&s;tival, by them called,

thereof. This Fe&s;tival &s;till commenceth
with a Sermon, which the <HI>Alcalib</HI> or chief
Prie&s;t makes concerning its In&s;titution,
with amplification of its Prai&s;es. Re|turning
home from the Sermon, the
<HI>Moors</HI> fall to killing &s;uch Sheep as they
have made choice of for their Entertain|ment
at this Solemnity, and there is not
the meane&s;t Fortune, but now has his

<HI>Mecha,</HI> and Swearing by <HI>Alquibl&aacute;.</HI>
This done, every Family takes the Heart

dre&s;s it with Saffron, red and black Pep|per;
then, with &s;tore of Bread, they
bring it to their Pari&s;h Church (where
every Quality knows his &s;tation) and eat
it in Communion. Returning from this

and colder in Winter then the Ma|ritine,
which may ea&s;ily be conceived,
by con&s;idering what Neighborhood the
one hath with the Sea, the other with
the Mountains, which from <HI>December</HI>
to the latter end of <HI>February</HI> are co|vered
with Snow; at the Re&s;olution of
which, &s;uch Rivers are cau&s;ed, that
in &s;ome places the Channels will yield
<PB N="222" REF="120">
Water the whole Summer en&s;uing.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants live long, and are
generally Healthy; the Di&s;ea&s;es, when
they happen, are Fluxes, after the Sea|&s;on
of Fruits; and Calentures, when
they immoderately Travel in the Sun.
And what &s;eems herein remarkable, the
Winter (which Sea&s;on con&s;i&s;t of great
Rains) is mo&s;t mortal among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lues Venerea,</HI> or Foul Di&s;ea&s;e
(which the <HI>Moors</HI> call <HI>Bub&egrave;s)</HI> is incident
to tho&s;e who accompany with variety of
Women: and though this may &s;eem to
confine that Di&s;temper to tho&s;e <HI>Moors,</HI>
who live after a more rude and roving
manner, yet it is no &s;tranger to tho&s;e of
a more refin'd and &s;etled Life, the Gran|dees
of late having herein exceeded the
Pai&s;ants.</P>
<P>As to the Plague, they ob&s;erve no &s;et
time of its return, the tenth and fifteenth
Year of its coming being worn out of
Remarks; and in this la&s;t Century it
has hapned very &s;eldom, but in no parts
it doth rage more furi u&s;ly then in <HI>Bar|bary:</HI>
and when they are vi&s;ited, the
Inhabitants take little or no care to a|void
it, holding it to be inevitable.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="120">
In cure of Sickne&s;&s;es, they u&s;e very
plain Medicines, and whatever be the
Di&s;ea&s;e, Cauterizing is fir&s;t practi&s;ed,
which they do with no more Art or Cu|rio&s;ity,
then with a Knife red hot to ga&s;h
and cut the place where the Pain lies. To
cure the Head-ach, they take the Root
<HI>Tauz Argent</HI> and Ro&s;emary, burning
them in an Earthen Pot, over which the
Di&s;ea&s;ed holds his Head for the Fume;
then binding the &s;ame in a Cloth about
the Head, pre&s;ent ea&s;e is given. This
<HI>Tauz Argent</HI> is a Root, much Celebrated
for an excellent and la&s;ting Perfume:
there is great &s;tore thereof about <HI>Sally,</HI>
which is white within, without duski&s;h
and &s;treaked. The <HI>Moors</HI> u&s;e it in Air|ing
and Perfuming their Rooms, but the
&s;cent is much le&s;s durable then has been
reported.</P>
<P>The People, when &s;ick, cure them|&s;elves
with Herbs, in who&s;e Virtues the
common People have a traditional know|ledge.
By this they &s;upply the want of
Apothecaries and Phy&s;itians, of which
Profe&s;&s;ion none are found, except a few
Mountebank ignorant Jews.</P>
<P>The <HI>Moors</HI> have an Herb called <HI>la Ha|lis,</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="121">
which mingled with Honey, they
make up into Balls as big as Pi&s;tol Bul|lets,
and of the&s;e they &s;wallow five or &s;ix
at a time, which they find to procure
Appetite, further Dige&s;tion, and to
make Frolick, Amorous and Witty. <HI>O|pium</HI>
is much u&s;ed by all &s;orts, rather for
Dyet then Phy&s;ick; and a <HI>Moor</HI> will
&s;ooner buy a Pill of <HI>Opium,</HI> then a Cake
of Bread, if his &s;tock be too little to buy
both. And in many places they are &s;o
accu&s;tomed to this Stupefactive, that the
want thereof proves fatal.</P>
<P>In former Times the People were &s;o
exqui&s;ite in mingling Poy&s;ons, that they
had &s;ome would kill by &s;mell: Of late
they are acquainted only with two
kinds, which they call <HI>Rah&aacute;&s;h</HI> and <HI>Ze|him.</HI>
The former is either white or pale,
and more quick in di&s;patching the Per|&s;on
who takes it. But <HI>Zehim</HI> (&s;ignify|ing
any thing that is coutrary to the Pa|lat
or liking) is cured with ince&s;&s;ant
Spitting. As for that Poy&s;on which once
they had the Art to communicate in Let|ters,
to kill tho&s;e who read them, they
are thereof at pre&s;ent totally Igno|rant.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="121">
<HI>Muley Mahumed</HI> having out of Politick
Ends prohibited Printing, made thereby
Writing of a more &s;ingular u&s;e and e|&s;teem;
and the <HI>Moors</HI> of old were noted
to be very excellent at the Pen, but now
in this, as in all other Learning, they are
much deficient of what they were for|merly,
for there are not many that ar|rive
to a higher Proficieney in Letters,
then barely to Write and Read: To
which end they have little Schools,
where the Children are taught after this
manner. The <HI>Moors</HI> having (as I &s;aid)
no Printed Books, when their Children
are &s;ent to School, they take with them
pieces of Boards, or Slats, on which the
School-Ma&s;ter writes &s;o many Letters of
the Alphabet; and when the Child has
learn'd their Names and Figures, the
Ma&s;ter writes them a certain number
more, and &s;o proceeds till the Alphabet
be ended: and then goes on to write
&s;ome Periods of the <HI>Alcoran</HI> (for they
teach no other Book) and continue this
Method till the whole <HI>Alcoran</HI> be wrote
over, which u&s;ually la&s;ts four Years.
When the Child has thus &s;pelt it over, he
begins to get it by heart, which co&s;ts
<PB N="226" REF="122">
eight Years at the lea&s;t; then the Child,
if his Father be able, is taught a little
Orthography. When the Child is come
to certain Periods of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> the
Father is obliged to make him a Congra|tulatory
Pre&s;ent: and when he has
learn'd the whole <HI>Alcoran,</HI> he is brought
home to his Fathers Hou&s;e in Proce&s;&s;ion
on Hor&s;e-back. As he Rides along, he
holds a Table written with <HI>Mahumeds</HI>
Law, whereon he continually fixeth his
Eye, thereby &s;ignifying, That the Ho|nor
conferr'd upon him was for the care|ful
Reading of the <HI>Alcoran;</HI> and when
the Youth, accompanyed with the <HI>Al|faq&ugrave;i,</HI>
School-ma&s;ter, and School-fellows,
hath vi&s;ited all the Churches, they come
to his Fathers Hou&s;e, where they are en|tertain'd,
and the Ma&s;ter rewarded for
the care &s;hewn in the Proficiency of his
Scholar.</P>
