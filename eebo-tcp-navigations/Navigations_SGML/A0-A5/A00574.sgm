<HEAD>CHAP. I. How <HI>Richard Cordelion</HI> King of England, going to the holy Land, &s;lew <HI>Phillip</HI> the Prince of Au&s;tria, and how <HI>Don Iohn</HI> doomed him to a mo&s;t &s;trange puni&s;hment, and of his wo|full lamentation in pri&s;on.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen the true &s;pirits of illu&s;trious atchieue|ments, po&s;&s;e&s;t the Nobility of Europe, and that the Babes of honour, fed vpon the milke of Knightly aduentures, here raigned in Eng|land, a royall minded King, named <HI>Richard Cordelion,</HI> a Prince repleni&s;hed with the commendable re|ports of renowne, in who&s;e gouernement, both Armes and Art flouri&s;hed, warres wrought peace, and peace brought happine&s;&s;e. In this Kings time, the ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate of Gods holy City of Ieru&s;alem, groaned vnder the heauy yoke of Pagani&s;me, and the de&s;pi&s;ed Infidels with pride and tyran|ny &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all her royalties, for recouery whereof, all Chri&s;tendome tooke Armes, and the rumors of warre wrath|fully thundered in all our Northerne Nations.</P>
<P>Fiue Chri&s;tian Kings, (vnder the bloody &s;tanders of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of Bullin,) (that imperious Monarks, and wor|thy of the World) marched. Among&s;t which glorious num|ber, one matchles King, <HI>Richard Plantaginet,</HI> was too aduen|turous forward, for he in the blooming bud of his youth, with the chiefe&s;t Chiualry of England, cloathed in &s;t&eacute;ele, fired with
<PB N="2" REF="3"> fame and full of re&s;olution, left the gouernment of his king|dome to his brother <HI>Iohn,</HI> then Duke of Ireland, and arri|ued in Au&s;tria, the m&eacute;eting place of the&s;e Chri&s;tian Poten|tates.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of this Campe royall, not then in a readine&s;&s;e, ac|cording to the cu&s;tomes of Princes, cau&s;ed King <HI>Richard</HI> to reque&s;t entertainement for him and his Knights. <HI>Don Iohn</HI> then Duke of Au&s;tria, being a Prince &s;o curteous and no|ble, that he could doe no le&s;&s;e then grant it. Now Fame and Fortune in King <HI>Richards</HI> thoughts &s;miled, and the &s;mooth brow of wi&s;hed good &s;p&eacute;ed, bad him and his hundred Knights welcome.</P>
<P>A hundred he had as then for his guard, called Knights of the Bath, a title of dignity fir&s;t giuen by this King: but now while the re&s;t of his Army planted their &s;tanders vpon the downes adioining to the Court, the&s;e Knightly Gallants &s;o reuelled in the Dukes Pallace, that well were they that could purcha&s;e their fauours, and highly graced were all &s;uch as had but the &s;malle&s;t imployment of an Engli&s;h Knight.</P>
<P>So amiable, plea&s;ing, and curteous, were the conditions of King <HI>Richard</HI> and his followers, &s;o truely were their minds deuoted to honour, that they euen inforced loue from all e&s;tates, the haughty minded of their own accords became gentle, the &s;tubborne nature pliable, and the frowne of eue|ry Engli&s;h brow by de&s;ert challenged both cap and kn&eacute;e, <HI>Don Iohn</HI> him&s;elfe began to grow di&s;gracious, his Subiects wa|uering, alegiance waxed cold, and none but the name of Eng|li&s;h <HI>Richard</HI> merited Fortunes high graces: All Au&s;tria e&s;t&eacute;e|med England a happy Nation, by nature the darling of ver|tue, and the only hopes of Chri&s;tendome, &s;o grealy are &s;till the fauors of our Engli&s;h people in the eies of forren kingdoms.</P>
<P>This detracted loue of his &s;ubiects did not a little di&s;plea&s;e <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> and his &s;on Prince <HI>Phillip,</HI> and no little enuy by it were bred in their two fired brea&s;ts, that nothing could quench the increa&s;ing flame therof, but King <HI>Richards</HI> &s;hame and confu&s;ion. Politicke and clo&s;e were their purpo&s;es,
<PB N="3" REF="3"> deadly and diuelli&s;h their intents, and mo&s;t vnhumane and vnchri&s;tian like their proc&eacute;edings, the law of Armes was quite laid a&s;ide, the honor of Princes forgotten, and the dig|nity of Knight hood vilely abu&s;ed, malice, and wrath, the champions of pale death hourely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their two hearts, with a &s;ecret imagination of vengeance, plotted again&s;t the life of royall <HI>Richard,</HI> to murther by violence, would but in|curre di&s;plea&s;ures of forren Nations, to kill innocents offen|deth Heauen, and to betray Princes, hath rewards in hell, a thou&s;and thou&s;ands of di&s;plea&s;ing motions, di&s;quieted their di&s;contented mindes, di&s;honoured as they thought by the vertues of King <HI>Richard,</HI> di&s;grace boyling in her grea|te&s;t heart, could no longer be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but n&eacute;eds the flames of fury mu&s;t breake forth, and a flattering practi&s;e of reuenge|ment mollifie their intollerable torments, and in this man|ner was it accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> the onely &s;onne and heire apparant to <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> the pride and hopes of Au&s;tria, in who&s;e life and good Fortune con&s;i&s;teth his countries honor, like a de&s;perate and prodigall gallant, in a di&s;&s;embling &s;hape of friend&s;hip, challen|ged King <HI>Richard</HI> at a Princely turnament, and in the knightly games of tilting, per&s;onally to combat hand to hand, the Engli&s;h King in the Aprill of his man-hood, no|thing inferior in prowe&s;&s;e to Prince <HI>Phillip,</HI> hauing the &s;parkes of Maie&s;ty glowing in his bo&s;ome, in a mo&s;t prince|ly manner accepted his challenge, and again&s;t the day ap|pointed, prouided al things fitting for &s;o noble an enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Time with his lazy wings, &s;&eacute;emed to fly too &s;lowly, and to cro&s;&s;e the forward attempts of the&s;e youthfull combitants, each minute &s;&eacute;emed an houre, each houre a day, and each day a moneth, till the appointed time came of this royall turna|ment, &s;o bold, forward, and illu&s;trious were the&s;e martiali&s;ts, the one &s;triuing for honor, the other for reuenge.</P>
<P>I n&eacute;ed not here &s;peake of the &s;umptuous preparations, the exc&eacute;eding charge, and co&s;tly habilliments prouided again&s;t that day, numberle&s;&s;e were the eye-witne&s;&s;es of this Court-like
<PB N="4" REF="4"> pa&s;time, ready prepared to bid them welcome with a gracious applau&s;e. To come to the fulne&s;&s;e of this glory, the day approched, the morning Sunne ch&eacute;erefully ro&s;e with a bright &s;mile, the chri&s;tall Skie put on her faire&s;t robe, and the moderate aire &s;&eacute;emed to further their proc&eacute;edings, all things by nature were as furtherers to &s;ummon them to Armes, <HI>Don Iohn</HI> him&s;elfe attended by his greate&s;t Nobility, &s;ate as Vmpiers in the ca&s;e, and each Lady with a prepared eye, was ready to cen&s;ure of their de&s;erts, the tilting place being rayled in quadrangle-wi&s;e, round about be&s;et with lofty gal|leries, whereon people in degrees were placed in &s;uch multi|tudes, as memory it &s;elfe could hardly number: the Sunne beames had not more motes by imagination, then this thea|ter &s;pectators, equally wi&s;hing good fortune to them both, bright honors &s;ceane being ready to begin, the Drums and Trumpets gaue warning of the two combitants approch, in &s;uch a melodious manner, as both aire and earth re&s;ounded, the fir&s;t that entered the li&s;tes, was Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> in a black capari&s;on, his hor&s;e betrapt with &s;able, his beuer clo&s;e, made of the fa&s;hion of a flying Griffon, his Launce and Scutchion borne before him by a naked Indian, all agr&eacute;eable to his blacke de&s;ires: for the &s;t&eacute;eled point of his Launce, and the k&eacute;en edge of his &s;word, were both impoi&s;oned; his motto was, <HI>True honour hath no equall.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately after entered <HI>Richard</HI> of England, mounted vpon a Spani&s;h Gennet, as milke white and &s;potles as were his thoughts, his Armor bright and gli&s;tering, his Helmet of the fa&s;hion of a &s;unne &s;parkeling fire, expre&s;&s;ing both malice and mercy. Vpon his brea&s;t he had the honorable red cro&s;&s;e of England, platted with Arabian &s;ilke, his Motto was; <HI>Ho|nour tainted, in vaine repented.</HI></P>
<P>Thus all things in readines for this royall turnament, the ch&eacute;erefull reports of relentle&s;&s;e Drums and Trumpets, thundred a charge, whereupon the two couragious Princes, fired with re&s;olution, &s;o fiercely a&s;&s;ailed each other, that a &s;trange admiration of their man-hoods po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the be|holders.
<PB N="5" REF="4"> The old Duke <HI>Don Iohn</HI> him&s;elfe, &s;itting with a longing de&s;ire of his &s;onnes victory, was immediatly di&s;|contented wich the &s;pight of Fortune, for after he had woun|ded the Engli&s;h Prince with his impoi&s;oned weapons, to the great danger of life, couragious <HI>Richard</HI> expre&s;&s;ing his Lion-like nature, clo&s;ed Prince <HI>Phillip</HI> with &s;uch a manly power, that with his heauy courtelax, at one blow he broke his necke: Folly it were to re&s;i&s;t de&s;tiny, for euen at that in|&s;tant he y&eacute;elded vp the gho&s;t, and in the &s;ight of his old fa|ther imbraced death.</P>
<P>This &s;udden accident aduanced not &s;o much the honours of King <HI>Richard,</HI> as it &s;etled fury in <HI>Don Iohns</HI> heart, for ha|uing lo&s;t the hopes of his Kingdome, his onely &s;onne and glory of his age, like a man de&s;perate of all good fortune, ioy, and con&s;olation, he raged both again&s;t heauen and earth, bla&s;pheming his Creator, &s;wearing both by God and the world, that the trea&s;ures of Europe &s;hould not redeeme King <HI>Richards</HI> life, nor the vnknowne trea&s;ures of the d&eacute;epe Ocean (were they laid at his f&eacute;et) pre&s;erue him from a di&s;ho|nourable death: for (quoth he) in loo&s;ing my Sonne, the &s;ight of the World di&s;plea&s;eth me, I will pine in griefe, I will fa|mi&s;h with woe, I will liue foodle&s;&s;e, f&eacute;eding vpon nothing, but de&s;ires of vengeance. A&s;&s;i&s;t me thou &s;pirit of de&s;truction, that in wrath I may confound the murtherer of my &s;onne, in who&s;e life I more delighted, then in my royall crown: for in wanting him, I liue as a forlorne, wofull, and depo&s;ed King, exild and bani&s;ht from this worlds royalty: my &s;econd &s;oule adores the &s;malle&s;t drop of thy d&eacute;ere harts blood, &s;hal be quit|tanced with the purple goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e of King <HI>Richards</HI> bo&s;ome. Ha|uing &s;poken the&s;e, or &s;uch like wordes, he commanded the Mar&s;hall of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> to take the Engli&s;h Prince vnto his charge, and to k&eacute;epe him clo&s;e pri&s;oner in a &s;quare Tower of Marble &s;tone, adioining to the vttermo&s;t part of his Court, and likewi&s;e to di&s;charge all the followers of his Countrey, vpon paine of death not any one of them to b&eacute;e &s;&eacute;en in his territories after the date of &s;euen daies. All which
<PB N="6" REF="5"> according to the angry Dukes command, was by the Mar|&s;hall &s;p&eacute;edily accompli&s;hed, the wofull King he to pri&s;on, and his &s;orrowfull followers to their natiue countrey, where his loyall Subiects made not a little moane for his hard mi&s;for|tunes; <HI>Don Iohn</HI> with his Nobility mourned as grieuou&s;ly for Prince <HI>Phillip,</HI> whom in mo&s;t &s;olemne manner they en|terred in a Princely Tombe, where we will leaue him &s;lee|ping in peace, and per&s;euere in this our wofull Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>King <HI>Richard</HI> hauing now neither Crowne, Kingdome, nor liberty, but (by his late receiued wounds, from Prince <HI>Phillips</HI> poi&s;oned weapons,) lay bl&eacute;eding in pri&s;on, to his liues greate&s;t danger, and being de&s;titute of friends, and all hopes of recouery, he dolefully breathed out this lamenta|tion.</P>
<P>Oh vniu&s;t Fortune (&s;aid hee) why in the prime of youth ha&s;t thou thus deceiued me, and by thy flattering promi&s;es of aduancement thus betraied my Knightly aduentures? Tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed warres, where the &s;tandard of Chri&s;t by their incouraging flouri&s;hes, makes cowards inconquerable, mu&s;t by mee bee for&s;aken, and my vnhappy daies by <HI>Don Iohns</HI> vnprincely doome, haue ending, &s;weat with teares.</P>
<P>Oh you ingrateful wals, that with your pittile&s;&s;e bounds cla&s;pes in a royall Prince; mercile&s;&s;e woe like a cruell ty|rant f&eacute;edes vpon my heart, and the &s;unne &s;hine of delightfull con&s;olation is now for euer dimmed with the blacke cloudes of de&s;paire, bani&s;ht be all hopes of liberty, and the freedome that attends on Kings, is curbed with the ba&s;e pennance of captiuity: Farre more fortunate is the humble e&s;tate of the Plow-mans life, he &s;uffers onely the cro&s;&s;e of priuate di&s;gra|ces, when principalities indure the generall &s;candall of di&s;|honour, wherein Kingdomes, and the glory of Diadems, lo&s;e their illu&s;trious dignities. Where are now all my courtly traines of &s;tarre-bright Nobility, my attendant followers, my gardiants, and humble &s;eruitors, my pompous &s;tate, roi|all banquetings, and delightful mu&s;icke, all &s;o my &s;oules eter|nall griefe, now vani&s;hed, and conuerted into continuall la|mentations:
<PB N="7" REF="5"> no fellow&s;hip haue I to comfort me, but di&s;con|tent, &s;ighes, and melancholy di&s;paire: Care is my food, and teares my drinke, nothing but the imaginations of woe, in|tercepts all hopes of fr&eacute;edome.</P>
<P>Oh vnhappy England, thou nur&s;e and mother of my life, di&s;honoured in thy Kings di&s;graces, and made mo&s;t mi&s;era|ble by this iniurious and mo&s;t vnprincely dealings, Heauen I hope with blacke vengeance, deadlier then the feare of hell, will in time &s;pie out a mo&s;t dreadfull quittance, written in the bloody brow of a cur&s;ed <HI>Austria,</HI> &s;tained with inhumane murther of a King, who&s;e death the child as yet vnborne &s;hall rew, and after ages &s;hall &s;peake off: pitty my di&s;tre&s;&s;es thou reuenger of mankind, that my &s;oule may &s;l&eacute;epe in peace, and re&s;t in that ble&s;&s;ed man&s;ion prepared for Monarches.</P>
<P>The&s;e or &s;uch like heart-breaking complaints being brea|thed from his grieued bo&s;ome, the paine of his impoi&s;oned wounds &s;o inraged, and &s;o furiou&s;ly tormented his body yet bl&eacute;eding that (poore King,) he fell into a &s;wound, liuele&s;&s;e, and breathles, &s;auing a little panting breath moued in his brea&s;t, a &s;igne that the &s;parkes of life were not quite extingui&s;hed.

<HEAD>CHAP. II. How the two Engli&s;h Earles of <HI>Arundell</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> di&s;gui|&s;edly comforted King <HI>Richard</HI> in pri&s;on, of the loue be|twixt him, and <HI>Clarabella</HI> the Dukes daughter; how he how hee pulled out the Lyons heart, and thereby came to bee called <HI>Richard Cordelion,</HI> and of other acci|dents.</HEAD>
<P>_ACcording to the heauy and bitter command of the angry Duke, (in reuenge of his &s;onnes death,) the Nobility and Knights of <HI>England</HI> departed <HI>Don Iohns</HI> Kingdome, leauing the wofull King in pri&s;on, as a&s;hamed of &s;o hap|le&s;&s;e a voiage, where being no &s;ooner come, and the reports thereof bruted in the eares of the Earles of <HI>A|rundell</HI> and <HI>Oxford,</HI> but like two Engli&s;h &s;pirited gallants, not able to brooke this forraine di&s;grace, they re&s;olutely de|parted England, prote&s;ting either to bring their Soueraigne Lord &s;afely to his Kingdome, or to leaue their bodies buried in <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> that blood (quoth they) &s;pent in the honour of our King and Countrey, is the &s;weet &s;acrifice of Knight-hood, and the true vermillion colour, that beautifies the rich robes of honour.</P>
<P>Thus nobly minded, they with all &s;peed cro&s;&s;ed the Seas, which they were ioyfull off; &s;o with &s;o glorious a burthen, and the whi&s;ling wind, proud of the&s;e Princely re&s;olued Gentle|men, louing kind, and loyall, &s;et open their gentle portals, and beyond the expectation of man, &s;et them &s;afely vpon the co&s;ts of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> where being no &s;ooner come, but they attired them|&s;elues in the di&s;gui&s;ed habits of Fryers, the mo&s;t &s;ecret, and fitte&s;t pollicy to attaine the wi&s;hed pre&s;ence of their impri&s;o|ned
<PB N="9" REF="6"> King, and by that meanes thought they to relieue him, if his extremity &s;o much required; &s;o comming to the pri&s;on gate in a profe&s;&s;ed zeale, as they &s;aid they had of King <HI>Richards</HI> &s;oules health: they de&s;ired acce&s;&s;e, and that the Lord Mar&s;hall would admit them to the Kings pre&s;ence, who being a man of a curteous nature, could doe no le&s;&s;e then grant their re|que&s;t, being &s;o hone&s;t and vertuous a demand.</P>
<P>Frowning Fortune beganne now a little to &s;mile, and a little to ea&s;e his langui&s;hing &s;orrowes: for no &s;ooner had his gentle eies ca&s;t their dimme &s;ights (almo&s;t blinded with teares) vpon his two deare friends, but a &s;udden reioycing hope a&s;&s;ailed his heart, and like a royotous heire newly po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing his patrimony, &s;urfetted in plea&s;ure, all di&s;pairing pa&s;&s;i|ons by the delightfull pre&s;ence of the&s;e two Engli&s;h Earles, were immediatly conuerted into iollity, their imbraces were as the clo&s;es of new married Dam&s;els, where the extremity of ioy &s;o &s;welled in their bo&s;omes, that euen their eyes di&s;til|led teares, (and their hearts as it were danced.) The&s;e two &s;uppo&s;ed Friers had no other Ori&s;ons, but comfortable re|ports from his loyall Subiects in England: their Bookes were their loues, and their Beades their fealties.</P>
<P>Thus in this &s;ecret manner vn&s;u&s;pected of any, repaired they daily to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed King, expecting hourely his liues metamorpho&s;es, either of liberty or death: Freedome, or con|fu&s;ion, royalty, or captiuity: in which wauering doubt, while the&s;e three &s;ubiects of &s;orrow remained, the di&s;plea&s;ed Duke (&s;till harbouring in his heart blacke malice, called a coun&s;ell of flattering &s;icophants, &s;uch as be &s;till the attendants of Mo|narkes, where again&s;t both the law of Armes and Nations, it was decreed that King <HI>Richard</HI> &s;hould combate with a Ly|on, which if he ouercame, his liberty thereby might be purcha|&s;ed; but being ouercome, he &s;hould endure the &s;harpe puni&s;h|ment of this mercile&s;&s;e bea&s;t, who&s;e greate&s;t fauour were but death: vpon which pittile&s;&s;e doome, this bloody coun|&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l concluded, and thereupon appointed the time and houre, to the extreame griefe of many thou&s;adns, who&s;e

<P>Neuer &s;ince the ten y&eacute;eres warres at <HI>Troy,</HI> did mans eye behold &s;o numberle&s;&s;e a multitude, all valiant, fearele&s;&s;e, and aduenturous; we for the honour of England, they for the honour of Au&s;tria: Seas of blood couered the gr&eacute;ene fields, and the f&eacute;ete of hor&s;es trampled out dead mens braines, the cries of dying &s;ouldiers &s;&eacute;emed like thunder, and the chri&s;t al Aire &s;pread forth her &s;able Canopy, mourning at &s;o wofull a ma&s;&s;acre.

<P>De&s;cend &s;ome vnlucky &s;tarre, fall vpon me you fatall pla|nets, and &s;trike me blinde, that my &s;ightle&s;&s;e eyes may behold no further mi&s;eries.

<P>At the&s;e wordes &s;h&eacute;e offered to teare forth her owne eyes, had not the gentle aduice of the two Earles per&s;waded her to patience, which &s;h&eacute;e willingly imbraced, and &s;o for that time parted company: Sh&eacute;e to her &s;orrowfull clo&s;et, they to the new refined Court, where (after K. <HI>Iohn</HI> had intelligence of

But &s;uch was the indignation of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> and &s;o violent in wrath, that euen death quittanced her fauourites. (Poore mappe of mi&s;ery!) &s;h&eacute;e was forced to for|&s;ake Courtly fa&s;hions, and to exchange her co&s;tly attires in|to beggers w&eacute;eds: &s;h&eacute;e that had wont to f&eacute;ed vpon the varie|ty of dainties, was now &s;ufficed with cour&s;e &s;eruices, no o|therwi&s;e then with tho&s;e things that &s;ati&s;fied hunger-&s;tar|ued hounds: many a little dogge (in the laps of young wan|tons) had more abundance of food then this gallant Lady had. Day by day walked &s;h&eacute;e comfortle&s;&s;e vp and downe the &s;tr&eacute;etes, moning her owne mi&s;fortunes, yet vnpittied, and left to her complaint. Night by night wearied &s;h&eacute;e out the long houres with remembrances of her former life, where euery minutes thought begot new griefe, and euery thought of new griefe almo&s;t &s;plit her heart: &s;ighes were as common obiects to &s;ati&s;fie her di&s;contents, being di&s;plea&s;ed with all things &s;h&eacute;e ca&s;t her eye vpon. Not any comfortable motion could &s;h&eacute;e entertain, wearied &s;h&eacute;e grew of the wanton world, not knowing which way to turne her &s;elfe: Mi&s;ery followed her vp and downe; when &s;h&eacute;e remembred <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> her Fa|thers Kingdome, di&s;obedience cut her heart, when &s;h&eacute;e cal|led to mind her Virginities wracke, a thou&s;and woes (ioi|ned with repentance) ouerwhelmed all in&s;uing hopes, and almo&s;t ca&s;t her into de&s;peration, &s;h&eacute;e &s;uppo&s;ed pitty to be deafe, and the tender remor&s;e of humane gentlenes to b&eacute;e &s;hut vp again&s;t her.

<P>Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> hauing read this &s;uper&s;cription, in pitty rued her e&s;tate, not knowing her to be his mother, for as yet his parents were vnknown to him, yet harbouring in his brea&s;t noble thoughts, he could not choo&s;e but extend cha|rity vnto her, and being the fir&s;t of his aduentures, and the maiden-head of his mercy, the fir&s;t good d&eacute;ed that euer he did, therefore he willingly alighted from his palphrey, and in tender pitty tooke the halfe &s;tarued Lady by the hand, &s;aying; If thou b&eacute;e&s;t de&s;cended royally, as the&s;e letters witnes that thou art, I am bound in all knightly curte&s;ies to defend th&eacute;e, and in maugre of blacke Fortunes &s;pight, &s;uccour thy di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed e&s;tate, as it &s;&eacute;emes now the worlds out-ca&s;t. Tell me faire Lady thy name, thy birth, and abode, and as I am &s;worne true Knight, I will be thy champion, and conduct th&eacute;e &s;afely into thine owne countrey. The&s;e gentle promi&s;es made by Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> a&s;pired new life into her fading body, who with a ch&eacute;erefull countenance &s;pake as followeth:</P>
<P>Deare Knight thy de&s;ert I know not, but &s;urely thou &s;&eacute;eme&s;t to be gracious in all thy proc&eacute;edings, and de&s;ires not I know to inforce a Lady, to &s;peake of that which will breake her heart to remember: Yet becau&s;e thou promi&s;e&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="17"> me thy gentle aide, to deliuer me from this mi&s;erable vale of woe, and &s;et me wi&s;hedly vpon the &s;hore of my natiue kingdome, vilely di&s;honoured by my wilfull follies: Vn|der&s;tand then I was borne in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> my name <HI>Clarabell,</HI> Princely my Father, from whom I di&s;obediently fled for the loue of a Northerne Monarke, vnto whom I y&eacute;elded vp the plea&s;ures of my virginity, the lo&s;&s;e whereof made me, (though no wife) yet an vnhappy mother: for which blacke &s;inne I am now thus puni&s;hed. Que&s;tion no further &s;w&eacute;et Gentleman, for the re&s;t will bereaue me of life, but accor|ding to thy noble di&s;po&s;ition, be my gardian, and conduct me to my natiue countrey, and the rewarder of all good d&eacute;eds, will quittance your curte&s;ies. Ind&eacute;ed faire Lady (quoth he) as our oathes in Knight-hood be &s;o to doe, &s;o in performance thereof I will aduenture my life, though it be to the Kings high di&s;plea&s;ure. So taking her vp behind him vpon his hor&s;e, he carried her to the next towne, and there both chee|red her pining body with comfortable victuals, and after cloathed her in &s;uch garments as befitted the degr&eacute;e of a Gentlewoman, and &s;o &s;et forwards towards Au&s;tria, &s;pen|ding the &s;low time away with plea&s;ing di&s;cour&s;es, little thinking of the n&eacute;ere alliance that was betwixt them two, the one the mother, the other the &s;onne: but heauen meaning to &s;hew a wonder in their liues, would not as yet &s;uffer their kindreds to be brought to light.</P>
<P>So trauelling on as I &s;aid before, they were intercepted by a mo&s;t &s;trange obiect, which were thr&eacute;e mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ed creatures, &s;&eacute;eming by their attires to be weomen, and the thr&eacute;e nur&s;es (in former times) of young <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> which <HI>Clarabell</HI> full well knew, but that &s;h&eacute;e feared to be di&s;|couered. The good Knight being &s;til pittifull, beholding their mi&s;eries, the one dumbe, the next blind, and the third lame. Thr&eacute;e woefull companions, whom age and time had thus cro&s;&s;ed with heauy calamity, hee like a true godly minded man, with that ring which the Fairy Qu&eacute;en had giuen him, cured all their maladies, the vertues of it being &s;o excel|lent,
<PB N="31" REF="17"> that it no &s;ooner touched their di&s;membred bodies, but immediately they were all made perfect, the lame could goe, the blinde &s;&eacute;e, and the dumbe &s;peak: which miracle done by Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> according to the will of heauen, in|forced teares through extreame ioy, to fall from the three recouered Nur&s;es eyes, de&s;iring the maker of all things to reward his curte&s;ies. The good Knight, not onely cured their griefes, but gaue them great &s;tore of gold out of his mo&s;t plentifull pur&s;e, another gift from the Fairy Qu&eacute;ene by him receiued. Now the&s;e thr&eacute;e new reuiued weomen be|ing &s;afe and &s;ound, no &s;ooner departed, but faire <HI>Clarabell</HI> greatly de&s;ired to be Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e of two &s;uch precious Iewels as this Ring and the Pur&s;e was, whereupon in mo&s;t gentle manner &s;h&eacute;e intreated Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> to be&s;tow them vpon her, that for his &s;ake &s;h&eacute;e might were them, a fauour to her heart (as &s;h&eacute;e &s;aid) more inualuable then was the Iewell that <HI>Marke Anthony,</HI> gaue <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Qu&eacute;ene of Egypt, gifts in his imagination, pri&s;ed aboue the worlds Monar|chy, yet being loath to deny her reque&s;t, he mo&s;t willingly gaue her them, and with his owne hand putting the Ring vpon her pretty finger, and tying the rich pur&s;e by her come|ly &s;ide, he &s;aid, Neuer let Knightly prowe&s;&s;e aduance my re|putation, nor record my liues fame in the booke of memora|ble time, but let me die blotted with cowardice, the foule &s;taine of matchle&s;&s;e Knighthood, when I refu&s;e to accompli&s;h the lea&s;t motion of your Lady-&s;hips de&s;ire: for in your coun|tenance &s;hines honourable graces, and promi&s;eth dignified vertue. To whom <HI>Clarabell</HI> with a mode&s;t behauiour an|&s;wered in this &s;ort: And much were I too blame (Sir knight) if I &s;hould not &s;eeke by de&s;ert to requite your kindne&s;&s;e, and vile ingratitude as a di&s;grace to my calling, might be well allotted to my &s;hare: If time and good fortune euer aduance me to my former e&s;tate, I will make thy credit equall Gre|cian <HI>Achilles,</HI> and cau&s;e the worlds famous antiquaries to &s;ignifie thy martiall condition: thou ha&s;t bewitcht mee with thy vertues, and with the chaine of manly carriage bound

Liuing, or dead, great <HI>Ioue</HI> protect him: this is my orizon to heauen, and vp|pon this doe I daily meditate. The&s;e mi&s;ticall &s;p&eacute;eches of hers, might haue lighted the fire of di&s;couery, but that blind fate would not as yet haue them knowne. The&s;e and &s;uch like, were the plea&s;urable di&s;cour&s;es betwixt the&s;e two tra|uellers, with the which they &s;pent away many a long day and weary night, without any aduenture worth the noting. But as Fortune is not alwaies &s;miling, here &s;h&eacute;e beganne a|gaine to frowne, and to cro&s;&s;e their de&s;ires with an vnlookt for chance: For vpon a hot &s;ummers day, when the bright Sunne in his greate&s;t glory &s;hined in the horizon, in a mo&s;t intollerable heat, the poore Lady wearied with trauell, &s;at her downe to re&s;t in a plea&s;ant gr&eacute;ene &s;hade of tr&eacute;es (where dallying with the Ring vpon her lap) &s;h&eacute;e fell fa&s;t a&s;l&eacute;epe, du|ring which &s;w&eacute;et &s;lumber, there came a huge blacke Rauen &s;oaring by, and thinking the yellow Ring to be &s;ome prey, which lay vpon her lap, with her tallents catcht it vp, and therewithall flew quite away, to the great ama&s;ement of Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> &s;tanding by the &s;l&eacute;eping Lady as her gardiant, and being loth to loo&s;e &s;o rare a Iewell, moun|ted vpon his St&eacute;ed, and in mo&s;t &s;wift manner followed the Rauen &s;o farre, that he quite lo&s;t the pre&s;ence of faire <HI>Cla|rabell,</HI> whom (for a while we will leaue &s;l&eacute;eping) and &s;peake what &s;trange aduenture happened to this noble Knight.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. How Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> was found by the Moores, and pre|&s;ented to the King of Morocco. Of his aduentures in that Kingdome. The lamentation of <HI>Clarabell</HI> for her pa&s;&s;ed life: and how in penance thereof, &s;hee builded a Mona&s;tery for the receit of poore Pilgrims.</HEAD>
<P>_NOble minded <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> followed the flight of this rich pri&s;ed Rauen, carrying in his beake the worth of a Kings ran&s;ome, not re&s;ting nor pitching vpon any tr&eacute;e or branch, till &s;h&eacute;e had let the Ring fall into the Sea, which &s;truck &s;uch terrour to the heart of <HI>Fau|konbridge,</HI> (then &s;tanding vpon the &s;hore, &s;&eacute;eing the euent) that he almo&s;t ca&s;t him&s;elfe after it into the waues, but that better graces guided him, and hope of better Fortunes re|&s;trained his de&s;peratene&s;&s;e. Standing thus ama&s;ed, and cal|ling to mind the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Clarabella</HI> (whom he had left com|fortle&s;&s;e behind) &s;l&eacute;eping in a gr&eacute;ene &s;hade of tr&eacute;es, not know|ing how, nor which way to returne backe, belieuing neuer more to behold her Angelicall countenance: Therefore like a mournefull Traueller (loo&s;ing him&s;elfe in &s;ome de&s;art wil|derne&s;&s;e) he breathed out this vnpittied lamentation:</P>
<P>Many and vnlucky are my fir&s;t aduentures (quoth he) at|tended on by cro&s;&s;e chances, and vntoward proc&eacute;edings; no motion of reliefe can I premeditate vpon. For I am come by ill Fortune into a place of de&s;olation, not frequented by the habitation of man: Here liues nothing but gr&eacute;ene bel|lied Serpents, roaring Wolues, and bea&s;ts of fearefull &s;hapes, &s;uch as may well terrifie the proude&s;t courage: Here &s;ounds no other Ecchoes but the croakes of Rauens, night-Owles, cries, and the bellowing of vntamed Tygers, &s;uch as thunders forth nothing but &s;ounds of death and de&s;tru|ction: here is no other food to &s;u&s;taine nature, but wild hem|locks, henbane, and &s;uch impoi&s;oned w&eacute;edes, the onely &s;tore|hou&s;e
<PB N="34" REF="19"> of blacke inchanters, witches, and charmers, the aire &s;&eacute;emes to be corrupted, and the earth ca&s;ts vp putrifying &s;a|uours, wor&s;e then the &s;moaking lake where <HI>Sodome</HI> and <HI>Gomorra</HI> &s;tood. In this manner complained he for the &s;pace of thrice twelue houres, looking euery houre to be deuoured by wild bea&s;ts, but that his Lyon-like garment which hee wore, made them thinke him to bee one of their number, which &s;auage creatures in tame manner lodged by his &s;ide.</P>
<P>As he thus betw&eacute;en feare and hope, expected pre&s;ent death, hee beheld a Turki&s;h galley houering by the &s;hore &s;ide, the Captaine whereof (being a noble minded Gentleman) at the fir&s;t &s;ight of young <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> ca&s;t a Land, where (be|holding his di&s;tre&s;&s;es) tooke him aboord, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nlookt for fa|uour, not a little reioiced him: but being &s;o happily pre&s;er|ued from death, mo&s;t willingly &s;ubmitted to their mercies, they being Moores, he a Chri&s;tian: they mi&s;bel&eacute;euing, he true in faith, they blacke, he faire, two extreame contrarie|ties: yet when the&s;e Heathen people beheld his face &s;tored with &s;uch maie&s;ty, re&s;embling the beauty of his Creator: they admired his Angelike countenance, neuer before that time &s;&eacute;eing a man of his colour, but all blacke like them|&s;elues, therefore &s;uppo&s;ing to haue found &s;ome heauenly An|gell, they pre&s;ented him to their King, as then k&eacute;eping his Court &s;ome foure miles di&s;tance from that place, on the o|ther &s;ide of the Sea, (being but a cr&eacute;eke of the maine Ocean) in a mo&s;t &s;umptuous Pallace, for brightne&s;&s;e like to the Tower of the Sunne.</P>
<P>The Morrocco King with his blacke countenance, ad|uancing him&s;elfe in his royall throne, with great admirati|on receiued Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> not as a Captiue, or a chai|ned Galley-&s;laue, but like the Darling of Maie&s;ty, or as the Paragon of Fame, &s;ent from Heauen to glorifie his Court. Legions of reports might wee make of his entertainement with the Morocco King and his Nobles, who e&s;t&eacute;emed him rather to be &s;ome God, then a worldly man, more dignified honours heaped they vpon his backe, then euer that country
<PB N="35" REF="19"> gaue vnto a &s;tranger. The wealth of that Kingdome made they his trea&s;ury, and ma&s;&s;es of Indian pearles lay &s;till at his commandement, the time of his abode there pa&s;&s;ed on a|pace, and iollity of his life made &s;euen y&eacute;ers but as a month-</P>
<P>Which being ouerpa&s;&s;ed, it was his chance vpon a &s;o|lemne fe&s;tiuall day, which was the birth day of their King, onely once in &s;eauen y&eacute;eres &s;olemnized, to behold the chiefe&s;t of the Kings Nobility in their riche&s;t ornaments, going as it were on proce&s;&s;ion in the honour of their Prophet <HI>Maho|met.</HI> Placing him (as it &s;&eacute;emed in heauen) to the high di&s;|honour of the Chri&s;tians God, who&s;e wrath and indignati|on is the whole Worlds confu&s;ion, and who&s;e fauour the pre&s;eruation of man-kind.</P>
<P>This God and liuing Power, was the Patrone of Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> by who&s;e fauour he hoped to conquer Fats, and &s;ubdue Kingdomes: This God when he &s;aw him thus highly di&s;honoured, fury po&s;&s;e&s;t him, and to the great di&s;pa|ragement of all that heathen Nation, he de&s;perately tore downe the picture of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and with his k&eacute;ene edged Semitary cut it in &s;mall pieces, to the great ama&s;ement of the Kings Nobility, who in gr&eacute;edy reuenge furiou&s;ly &s;et vp|pon him altogether (like a number of whelps vpon a prince|ly Lyon) who &s;o Lyon-like behaued him&s;elfe, that in le&s;&s;e then halfe an houre, hee left breathle&s;&s;e vpon the blood-died earth, more then &s;ixe and twenty of the Kings Nobles, ap|prouing here his vnconquerable valour, proc&eacute;eding from the vertue of his Lion like garment, which the Fairy Qu&eacute;ene had giuen him.</P>
<P>At this bold enterpri&s;e performed with his owne hand, he cau&s;ed the Moores to ring forth their Alarum Bels, and to fire their Beakons, to rai&s;e vp their country forces, thinking that heauen had thither &s;ent a confounder of mankind, and that by his onely meanes their kingdome &s;hould be &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>This matchle&s;&s;e enterpri&s;e performed by noble minded <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> did not a little perplex the King, nor no idle feare a&s;&s;ailed his mind, but &s;uch a fright as made his very &s;oule to tremble: wherefore to rid his kingdom from pre&s;ent
<PB N="36" REF="20"> danger, in mo&s;t kind manner he proclaimed truce, and di&s;|&s;emblingly applauded Lord <HI>Faukonbridg</HI> for this de&s;perate attempt: (and though to his griefe of mind) with faire and princely promi&s;es, he per&s;waded this Engli&s;h Gallant to de|part his Country: and the more to aduance his de&s;erued ho|nours, the King be&s;towed vpon him twelue barrels of good red gold, and withall a &s;hippe well furni&s;hed, to conduct him home into his owne Country. Which kind fauour was mo&s;t gratefully accepted off by noble <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> who leauing the Morocco Kingdome, put him&s;elfe to Sea, committing his fortunes againe to the merciles waues, but making the Pi|lot and Marriners bel&eacute;eue, that the twelue barrels of gold, were but twelue barrels of red lead: a commodity mo&s;t pre|cious in his natiue Countrey. The Pylot &s;uppo&s;ing no otherwi&s;e, &s;ailed amaine with pro&s;perous wind towards the Northerne nations. In which &s;ucce&s;full iourney, we will leaue now Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> and returne to his vnknown Mother (Lady <HI>Clarabell</HI>) whom we left as you heard before, &s;leeping vnder a &s;hade of tr&eacute;es, where Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> beganne to follow the chace, after the vnlucky Rauen.</P>
<P><HI>Clarabell</HI> as we &s;pake of before in her &s;w&eacute;ete &s;leepe, little dreaming of the ab&s;enee of <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> at her awaking, both mi&s;t him, and the ring; two lo&s;&s;es &s;o precious, as euen cau&s;ed &s;orrow to reuel in her bo&s;ome, that Ioy was a &s;tran|ger, and content exiled; diuers were the doubts &s;hee had of his mi&s;aduentures, one while &s;hee &s;uppo&s;ed death like a ty|rant had po&s;&s;e&s;t him, another while &s;hee feared the breach of his promi&s;e, and that he had &s;ecretly fled from her, bearing a|way with him the inchanted Ring: Now one thing, then a|nother, not knowing what to coniecture, but when &s;hee &s;aw her &s;elfe quite bereft of his &s;weet pre&s;ence, the onely pre&s;er|uer of her life, exempted from al hope of his recouery, in great griefe of minde, &s;hee betooke her &s;elfe to trauell, and &s;o with weary &s;teps followed on the fir&s;t path &s;hee found, wherein &s;hee wandred day and night, receiuing little re&s;t, and le&s;&s;e food, making this &s;orrowfull mone vnto her &s;elfe. Oh thou

Surely &s;ome vnlucky euent hath befalne him: therefore, oh my heart &s;ob in griefe, and for his &s;ake make thy life but a pilgrimage of woe, con&s;ume in care, wa&s;te with w&eacute;eping, for I haue lo&s;t the Paragon of Knight-hood, who&s;e countenance promi&s;ed me to aduance my de&s;ired hope, and bring me &s;afely vnto the &s;hoare of my natiue Countrey: but &s;&eacute;eing dole and di&s;content hath cro&s;|&s;ed all my good Fortunes, I will for his &s;ake, with the trea|&s;ure of my neuer emptied pur&s;e, receiued from him, built vp a Mona&s;tery, and in the &s;ame (like a Mona&s;ticke Nunne) &s;pend out my daies in the &s;eruice of that God that hath thus cro&s;&s;ed me, and there be a continuall comforter of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Pilgrims, and warfaring trauellers, hoping that if life be in my d&eacute;ere friend, he will once againe arriue in that hap|py place, and once more &s;ati&s;fie my thir&s;ting eye with his Princely per&s;on. Being thus re&s;olued, &s;h&eacute;e trauelled &s;ome thr&eacute;e moneths iourney from the place, where &s;h&eacute;e lo&s;t her d&eacute;ere friend the Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> and there clo&s;e by the Sea &s;ide, &s;h&eacute;e builded a mo&s;t &s;tately Mona&s;tery, relieuing &s;till the wants of &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ed trauellers as pa&s;&s;ed that way, y&eacute;elding as well lodging, as meat and drinke, to &s;uch as &s;tood in n&eacute;ed thereof: For the maintenance thereof, &s;h&eacute;e had her inchanted pur&s;e &s;till ready furni&s;hed; thither re&s;or|ted people of all degr&eacute;es, thither came Princes, Monarkes,
<PB N="34" REF="21"> and maie&s;ticke Kings, that trauelled in deuotion to the &s;hrine of Chri&s;t in Ieru&s;alem. Thither came worthy cham|pions, Knights errant, and &s;uch as &s;ought for knightly at|chieuements: t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ither came religious Church-men, Pre|lates, and holy minded men, zealou&s;ly &s;&eacute;eking by Pilgrima|ges to wipe away worldly offences, thither came Plowmen, Shepheards, Fi&s;hermen, and &s;uch as were numbred a|mong&s;t the common people, thinking thereby to obtaine ab|&s;olution for their mi&s;d&eacute;eds, euery one offering in zeale vn|to her great &s;tore of riches, whereof &s;h&eacute;e had little n&eacute;ed, ac|counting it meritorious to giue towards the maintenance of &s;o vertuous a cu&s;tome. Among&s;t which number of Benefa|ctors, there was one <HI>Peter</HI> a Fi&s;herman, that in deuotion of minde, pre&s;ented vnto her a mo&s;t dainty Fi&s;h called a Dol|phin, a pre&s;ent more fitter for a Prince, then &s;uch an humble minded woman as &s;h&eacute;e was, who&s;e humility almo&s;t in that Countrey purcha&s;ed her the name of a Godde&s;&s;e: This gift from the fi&s;herman was by her mo&s;t curteou&s;ly receiued, and mo&s;t bountifully requited with great &s;tore of golde, which &s;h&eacute;e tooke from out her inchanted pur&s;e: Herewith was old <HI>Peter</HI> well plea&s;ed, and the Lady better contented, for in the Dolphins belly &s;h&eacute;e found the &s;ame Ring, which the Rauen let fall into the Sea, the &s;ame Ring after which Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> &s;o vnhappily followed, the &s;ame King that by the precious touch of it healed all di&s;ea&s;es.

After this, thou&s;ands of oppre&s;&s;ed people in this place found &s;uccour, Pilgrims and weary trauellers here freely found lodging: Widdowes and &s;uccourle&s;&s;e Children, here ta&s;ted bounties liberality, maimed Souldiers, and &s;uch as lo&s;t their limbes in the &s;eruice of their Countrey, here &s;lept vpon downy beds, more &s;ofter then naples &s;ilke: Blind, deafe, and dumbe, in this place found helpe, not any di&s;ea&s;ed creature went from hence vncured, all which by this vertuous La|dy, was onely done in charity for Gods &s;ake, and to appea&s;e the torments of his &s;oule, that in guiding her to her natiue Countrey, lo&s;t his deere life.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. How Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> lo&s;t him&s;elfe in a barren Iland. His meanes of recouery. The finding againe of <HI>Clarabell.</HI> How the&s;e two were made knowne to each other. And of the great ioies betwixt the mother and her Sonne.</HEAD>
<P>_NOw is it time to report againe of Lord <HI>Fau|konbridge,</HI> and his fortunes on the Sea, and how his &s;hip loaden with his barrels of golde, lay houering on the billowes, many a day ex|pecting a pro&s;perous wind for England, but
<PB N="36" REF="22"> obtained none: For fate and good Fortune cro&s;&s;ed their hopes, and want of victuals &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed them, that hunger almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed their liues, and like a pittile&s;&s;e Tyrant would grant them no remor&s;e: twi&s;e &s;ixe moneths conti|nued this their extremity, to the terror of all good men, a death bringing horror both to man and bea&s;t. At the la&s;t, af|ter they had made many &s;ubmi&s;&s;iue prayers to God for a good winde, <HI>Aeolus</HI> &s;et open his brazen gates, and &s;ent them &s;uch a gentle gale, that they in thr&eacute;e houres &s;ayling, arriued vpon an Iland &s;o barren, that therein they found no other thing to &s;uccour their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and pre&s;erue them from fa|mi&s;hment, but onely fre&s;h water, with the which they &s;uffi|ciently &s;tored their &s;hip, giuing Heauen thankes for &s;o ble&s;|&s;ed a fauour. But this &s;uffi&s;ed not the de&s;ires of noble <HI>Fau|konbridge,</HI> hoping to find better reliefe for him and his men, re&s;olutely aduentured further vp into the Iland, to di&s;couer if he could wherewithall to vittaile his &s;hip. But woe is me to report it, this aduenturous Gentleman tra|uelled &s;o farre, that he lo&s;t his way, not being able to returne backe vnto his company, by which meanes he was con&s;trai|ned to &s;tay all night vpon the top of a tr&eacute;e, for feare of wilde bea&s;ts, whereof the Iland was full. But now marke how vnlucky all things fell out, the &s;ame night the wind ro&s;e, and &s;o violently droue the &s;hip from the &s;hore, that the Pilot was inforced to leaue Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> a Land, and com|mit his Fortunes to the Sea, where before day light they were ca&s;t vpon the coa&s;t where Saint <HI>Peters</HI> charitable Her|mitage was &s;cituated, they being Infidels and Moori&s;h na|tured people, neuer expected the &s;afety of Lord <HI>Faukonbrdge,</HI> being a Chri&s;tian, but left him comfortle&s;&s;e in the barren I|land, and ca&s;t a &s;hore where faire <HI>Clarabell</HI> abode, where com|ming a Land, de&s;ired her for his &s;ake that created her, to affoord them &s;ome reliefe, whereby their liues might be &s;a|ued, and their &s;hip &s;ufficiently repleni&s;hed with food fitting their intended voyage. Pittifull <HI>Clarabell</HI> good Lady&punc; &s;h&eacute;e greatly reioiced that it lay in her power to furni&s;h their
<PB N="37" REF="22"> wants, mo&s;t willingly gaue them entertainement, and y&eacute;el|ded them &s;uch refre&s;hing comforts, as pre&s;erued both their &s;hip and liues from peri&s;hing. Likewi&s;e they meaning to expre&s;&s;e no vngratefull thankes for &s;o kinde a fauour, as an humble &s;igne of good will, curteou&s;ly be&s;towed vpon her, the twelue barrels of gold which Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> reported to be red lead, all which according to her gentle nature, noble minded <HI>Clarabell</HI> receiued. So parting with thankes to each other, the Pilot returned to Morocco, very ioyfull for the riddance of Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> their Countries &s;uppo&s;ed enemy, and &s;h&eacute;e no le&s;&s;e delighted in the performance of her bountifull charity extended to the pre&s;eruation of &s;o many dying men. All this while Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> remained in the barren Iland, almo&s;t hunger-&s;tarued for want of food, in which place was nothing found to &s;ati&s;fie his gentle na|ture, but the fle&s;h of wilde bea&s;ts which hee killed with his owne hands, which (for want of fire) hee ro&s;ted in the &s;un, and with the &s;ame, (to his content) made more plea&s;inger banquets, then when he fea&s;ted in the <HI>Morocco</HI> Court, one|ly patience chiefly guided him, but being thus lo&s;t, and exi|led from the &s;ociety of humane creatures, he liued a long time in the woods, in &s;uch penurie and want, that his &s;trength began to faile, &s;ickne&s;&s;e grew on, and danger of life tormented him for want of naturall &s;u&s;tenance, cau&s;ed a grieuous kind of lepro&s;ie to grow quite ouer his body, in &s;uch &s;ort, that his Princely countenance was &s;uddenly chan|ged into a mo&s;t vgly vi&s;age, and pale death as it were &s;ate perching vpon his heauie brow, betwixt life and death, hee &s;ate him down vpon the root of a dead withered tr&eacute;e, making this complaint vnto him&s;elfe. If euer pitty (quoth he) entred the cele&s;tiall gate of Heauen, or euer remor&s;full mercy ten|derly lookt into the poore e&s;tate of a mi&s;erable Gentleman, then by this my liues ruine, may be &s;&eacute;ene the true patter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e of calamity: woe vpon me, cro&s;&s;e vpon cro&s;&s;e, and extremity vpon extremity, makes a vnity, and all con&s;pires together to worke my good Fortunes confu&s;ion. Here am I now left
<PB N="38" REF="23"> in a wilderne&s;&s;e of de&s;olation, friendle&s;&s;e without comfor|ter, not knowing which way to get forth, but committed to the vile tyranny of vntamed Tygers, euen ready to in|tombe my dying body within their blood-thir&s;ting bowels, a graue mo&s;t vnfit to clo&s;e vp my new created life. In &s;pea|king the&s;e words, he heard from a farre, as it were out of a hollow vaute, a voice &s;ounding forth the&s;e &s;p&eacute;eches: <HI>Faul|konbridge,</HI> ri&s;e vp and follow me: Fate and good chance will pro&s;per th&eacute;e. This &s;&eacute;emed to be the voice of the Fairy Qu&eacute;ene, his old Nur&s;e, being &s;till mo&s;t carefull of his liues pre&s;eruation, as it was ind&eacute;ed; which no &s;ooner ecchoed in the eares of Lord <HI>Faukonbridge,</HI> but he aro&s;e from vnder the tr&eacute;e where he lay, and being ready to goe forward all weake and &s;ickely as he was, he e&s;pied before, one of the Fairy In&s;truments, which was an <HI>Ignis Fatuis,</HI> the fire of de&s;tiny, or a going fire, which by nature fully leadeth wan|dring trauellers out of the way. This as his guide went &s;till before him, he with a &s;low pace followed after, not inter|cepted by any mi&s;aduenture, till hee came to the Sea &s;ide, where being ioyfully arriued, in good time he beheld a Barke &s;ailing by, to which he made &s;hew of entertainement, as one de&s;irous to be taken into their &s;hip, and to be conducted in to &s;ome better re&s;ting place: both his motions and his in|tent the Mariners &s;oone perceiued, whereupon they &s;ati&s;|fied his de&s;ire, and within few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">aies &s;et him &s;afely vpon the next inhabited kingdome, which was the happy place where <HI>Clarabell</HI> affoorded &s;uch bountifull liberality. Being thither come, the Countrey people and &s;uch as beheld his perplexed e&s;tate, led him as di&s;ea&s;ed as he was vnto <HI>Clarabels</HI> Mona|&s;tery, where being arriued, and &s;tanding &s;haking at the gate, he de&s;ired for his &s;ake that pardoneth all &s;innes, and requi|teth all good d&eacute;eds, that &s;h&eacute;e would with the oyle of her &s;kill balme his grieued paines, and with the mercy that &s;h&eacute;e fr&eacute;e|ly be&s;towes vpon di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;oules, cure his malady. Gentle <HI>Clarabell</HI> at this his humble reque&s;t, called him in, leading him vp inio a clo&s;e chamber, prepared onely for the comfort
<PB N="39" REF="23"> of &s;uch wofull creatures, in which place after &s;h&eacute;e had recei|ued his drooping &s;ences, and by the vertues of the &s;ame ring (he in former times had be&s;towed vpon her) recouered his wonted health, &s;h&eacute;e &s;&eacute;eming in his face, that beauty repleni|&s;hed againe, which before that time &s;hee &s;uppo&s;ed to haue &s;&eacute;ene, and calling to remembrance his former Fauour, &s;hee perfectly knew him, whereupon &s;eeking to imbrace him, &s;hee &s;ounded in his armes, and for the &s;udden ioy that he recei|ued by his &s;trange returne, lay for a good &s;ea&s;on in a dying trance: but being by great diligence recouered, they recoun|ted each to other the wonderfull Fortunes pa&s;&s;ed betwixt them, from the fir&s;t loo&s;ing of one another to that houre, Likewi&s;e he &s;pake, how hee neither knew Father nor Mo|ther, nor from whence he de&s;cended, and withall (opening his bo&s;ome) he &s;hewed her the golden Faulkon, by nature pictured vpon his brea&s;t, which when &s;hee beheld, her very &s;oule, as it were eleuated it &s;elfe to Heauen, and more then mortall ioy po&s;&s;e&s;t her heart. By this &s;hee knew him to bee her onely Sonne, begot by King <HI>Richard Cordelion,</HI> King of England, and &s;o made it knowne vnto him. Which when good Lord <HI>Faukonbridge</HI> vnder&s;tood, he in the true duty of a Sonne newly created, downe vpon his kn&eacute;es, craued her ble&s;&s;ing, and in great humility of mind gaue thankes to hea|uen, in that it was his Fortune to defend his mother in an vnknowne Land, from &s;o many dangers, and &s;hee like|wi&s;e made many deuout Orizons to God, that in his mercy had &s;o pre&s;erued them, and in this manner brought them mo&s;t &s;trangely together.</P>
