<P>_THey that a&s;pire to the Attainment of Wi&s;|dom, do not content them&s;elves with the Accurate Search of &s;ublime objects, but al&s;o conde|&s;cend to enquire into lower matters. In like manner, the renowned <HI>Bri|tains</HI> do not confine their contem|plations to their own homes, or to
<PB REF="5">
their neighbour Nations; but en|large their pro&s;pect unto the mo&s;t remote Countries, and with a piercing Eye, diligently pur&s;ue the exact di&s;covery of their &s;tate and condition. To which purpo&s;e, many per&s;ons of honour, and of curio&s;ity, have importun'd me to give &s;ome de&s;cription of the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Ionia,</HI> and the <HI>Aegaean</HI> I&s;lands; and to declare the pre&s;ent Condi|tion of tho&s;e great objects of Pity and Protection, the <HI>Greeks,</HI> now under the cruel Tyranny of the Wicked and Barbarous <HI>Hagarens.</HI> The de&s;ire I had to gratifie their learned curio&s;ity, who&s;e Judge|ments I had rea&s;on highly to e&s;teem, prevail'd with me to undertake a De&s;cription of &s;ome I&s;les of the <HI>Archipebago,</HI> namely, <HI>Samos, Ni|caria, Patmos,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> now called <HI>The Holy Mount.</HI> But becau&s;e this Work may &s;eem to want that Elegance, or depth of learning, re|qui&s;ite for a Book that mu&s;t appear upon the Stage of <HI>England,</HI> it &s;tands in need of &s;helter and protection.
<PB REF="5">
Which put me upon the bold nece&s;|&s;ity of flying to the Shadow of your Royal Highne&s;s's Patronage, to e&s;cape the &s;corchings of Contempt, and with all humble Reverence, to &s;helter it under the umbrage of your Royal Highne&s;s's propitious Name. And I mo&s;t humbly offer it, not as a thing of any merit; but as a mani|fe&s;tation of my <HI>devoir</HI> and gratitude, for tho&s;e great Obligations, which I, and in me all the <HI>Greek</HI> Nation has received. I therefore mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech your Highne&s;s, that as you have thought me worthy of your Bounty, &s;o to continue the &s;ame fa|vourable a&s;pect, in accepting this &s;mall demon&s;tration of my Grati|tude, and by your gracious Patro|nage, to &s;ecure it from their cen&s;ure, who are not &s;o forward to imitate our well intended pains, as to ex|po&s;e our defects. For which unde|&s;erved Favour, we can make Retri|bution only in our daily Prayers to Almighty God for your Highne&s;s's Health and Pro&s;perity in this World, and Eternal Happine&s;s in the World to come.</P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THe habitable Earth, by Di|vine di&s;po&s;al, be&s;tow'd upon the Children of Men, is but one great I&s;land. And tho&s;e Four eminent Parts of it which divide the whole among them, not by equal portions, but by the ca&s;ual in|tervention of Seas, are not totally &s;eparated one from another; but make one perpetual Continent. <HI>Africa</HI> is joyn'd to <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> by no very &s;mall neck of Land betwixt the Mediterranean and the Red Sea: And is no more an I&s;land properly &s;o call'd, than <HI>Peloponne&s;us. Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are joyn'd above the Lake of <HI>Maeotis</HI> with a large &s;pace of ground betwixt the <HI>Hyperborean</HI> Oce|an, and that Lake. And <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is joy|ned to <HI>America,</HI> by the Streights of
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Anian</HI> in all probability. There has nothing yet been di&s;cover'd to the con|trary, and the great Ab&s;urdities that attend the peopling of it are no way &s;o|ea&s;ily &s;olv'd. Be&s;ides this Main Con|tinent which is mounted above the Face of the Waters in one entire continua|tion of parts, there are many le&s;&s;er I&s;lands, entirely &s;urrounded by the Sea, and divided from all other ground. And all the&s;e are but &s;maller Si&s;ters to that great product of Nature, the Main Continent, not differing from it in kind, but in bulk and &s;ize. Whether they owe their birth to the general De|luge, or date their antiquity from the day of the Creation, the Scripture is &s;ilent, and &s;o am I. The Opinion of &s;everal I&s;lands being rent from the Main Continent, by the violent Incur|&s;ion of Seas, has been more forwardly embrac'd, than convincingly prov'd, and owes more to Poetical Fancy, than to any &s;olid Foundations of Philo&s;ophy. However, certain it is, that many I&s;lands are of later Antiquity than either the Creation, or the Flood, as on the contrary, many have either
<PB REF="7">
&s;ub&s;ided, or been over-whelm'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Earthquake does &s;ometimes produce both effects; and the &s;ame time brings Birth to one, and Burial to another. But the&s;e are the irregular mi&s;carriages of nature, labouring un|der a Convul&s;ion Fit, and teach us what may be, not what mu&s;t be; what na|ture may &s;ometimes &s;uffer, not what &s;he always doth. As for the whole Globe of Earth and Water, the admi|rable intermixture of them both for u&s;e and beauty, doth highly be&s;peak the Wi&s;dome of the Maker, and doth no le&s;s merit our contemplation, than the Canopy of Heaven. And that the rather, becau&s;e the inferiour World doth more neerly approach our Sen&s;es, and affords us clearer notice of their &s;tate and condition. Among all the a&s;&s;ociate Collection of I&s;lands, that by rea&s;on of their mutual vicinity, pa&s;s under one common name, there are none more remarkable than tho&s;e of the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, or the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> The&s;e were &s;o eminent in the days of the Prophets of the Old Te&s;tament, that from them all the We&s;tern parts of
<PB REF="7">
the then known World that was plan|ted principally by the Sons of <HI>Japhet,</HI> went under the common name of the I&s;les of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and the I&s;lands of <HI>Chittim.</HI> The <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> the fir&s;t eminent Navigators &s;ince the Flood, and the fir&s;t Planters of Lear|ning and Civility, as well as Colonies, along the &s;hores of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> and <HI>Atlantick</HI> Seas, began their di&s;coveries in the&s;e I&s;lands: And there they have left &s;uch vi&s;ible Foot|&s;teps of their fir&s;t Plantation, that the names they bear to this day are mo&s;t of them of <HI>Phoenician</HI> Extraction. The Colonies planted in the&s;e I&s;lands by the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> gave beginning to all tho&s;e Arts and Sciences for which the <HI>Greeks</HI> were afterwards &s;o famous, and their Language been held in &s;uch admiration to this day. The <HI>Aethio|pick</HI> I&s;lands are known all by <HI>Greek</HI> names; but they are as far inferiour to the <HI>Cyclades</HI> in renown, as they are in number, having neither been the Scene of Actions recorded by &s;uch Im|mortal pens, nor the native Soil of per&s;ons &s;o eminent for Arts and Arms.
<PB REF="8">
The conceit of <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> or &s;uch a future happine&s;s as the <HI>Heathens</HI> dream't of, was thought fit by their Poets to be fix'd upon &s;ome remote I&s;lands; therefore call'd the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> or <HI>Fortunate I&s;lands.</HI> The <HI>He&s;pe|rides</HI> and <HI>Canaries</HI> have been Compe|titors for the Title, and our modern &s;ear|chers into <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Antiquity do &s;train hard to make the <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides,</HI> or the <HI>Scilly</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> and <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> put in for a claim. But the Poets have been more accurate in maintaining the Cha|racter of an earthly Paradi&s;e, and de&s;cribing a felicity of &s;tate beyond that of a <HI>Platonick,</HI> or <HI>Utopian</HI> Commonwealth, than in directing us by any rules of Geography, where it is to be found. And as they have left it indifferent to the Reader to fix the Local Situation of &s;uch I&s;lands where they will, &s;o they have left it impo&s;&s;i|ble to any Reader to find &s;uch a place in the whole World. Indeed it is the high prerogative of great and la&s;ting Wits to affix an e&s;teem and veneration upon tho&s;e places they make the Stage of their Stories, be they true or fal&s;e.
<PB REF="8">
But in this point of credit, the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago</HI> do far &s;urpa&s;s any other in the World. And this is true, not only of the licentious and extra|vagant Fables of their Romantick <HI>My|thologie;</HI> but al&s;o in the graver and more creditable Records of &s;ober Hi&s;tory. They did heretofore in a manner en|gro&s;s the Monopoly of all the Wit and Fancy both of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome:</HI> In&s;omuch, that 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible for a man well vers'd in the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Tongues, to be a &s;tranger to the antient Geography of the&s;e Places: And <HI>Pliny,</HI> who was in nothing le&s;s erroneous, than in this part of his natural Hi&s;tory of the&s;e I&s;lands, does honour the Bay wherein they are &s;ituate, with the Ti|tle of <HI>Sinus claritatis literarum.</HI> A large <HI>Encomium,</HI> and &s;uch as no other aggregate body of I&s;lands had equal right to. The <HI>Japan, Philip|pine,</HI> and <HI>Molucco</HI> I&s;lands in the <HI>Oriental Ocean,</HI> are far beyond the&s;e for number; but the only thing they are &s;ought for is &s;ome natural products peculiar to their Soil and Climate, in which commendation, they do not ex|ceed
<PB REF="9">
the late di&s;coveries in the <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Ocean; but we find not that the World was ever beholding to the one, or the other, for the Propagation of Learning or Civility. Nor is it only fa|mous for the early ri&s;e of Humane Lear|ning and civil Culture, in the days of <HI>Gentili&s;m;</HI> but al&s;o for the early appea|rance of the more glorious Sun-&s;hine of the Heavenly Doctrin of the Go&s;pel. St. <HI>John</HI> the Divine, honoured in the Oracles of God, with the peculiar Title of <HI>the Di&s;ciple whom Je&s;us loved,</HI> was once an Inhabitant of the&s;e I&s;lands; where he founded the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Reli|gion, and writ that Divine and My&s;te|rious Book, which was indeed to him <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> but to all future ages <HI>Apocrypha.</HI> St. <HI>Paul,</HI> that great Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> did often cro&s;s this Sea, to plant the Doctrin of Salva|tion in all the neighbouring Shores of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> And in future ages, when the Divine Providence rai|&s;ed up a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Emperour to protect his Church from per&s;ecution, the&s;e I&s;lands were the very centre of once the mo&s;t Orthodox and learned Church in
<PB REF="9">
the World. To whom we owe not only the tran&s;mitting the Holy Scriptures to our knowledge; but al&s;o the dige&s;ting the Doctrin of them into Articles of Faith, the defence of Truth again&s;t all inva&s;ion of Errour, the faithful Re|cords of mo&s;t pure and primitive Tra|dition, the clear Expo&s;ition of many ob&s;cure pa&s;&s;ages, which without their direction, might have been at this day unintelligible, and the great advan|tage of many bearned and elaborate Volumes of Orthodox Divinity, both Polemical and Practick. And of all tho&s;e many different Sects of <HI>Chri&s;ti|anity</HI> in the Ea&s;t, they have to this day mo&s;t firmly retain'd the ancient Truths, and made the lea&s;t Deviation into Er|rour. If that ignorance which tho&s;e barbarous extingui&s;hers of learning, the <HI>Turks,</HI> keep them in, renders that afflicted Nation obnoxious to be impos'd upon, and incapable of knowing better, it de&s;erves rather our pity, than our contempt and &s;corn. It is rather a Mi|racle of Gods gracious Providence, that under &s;uch tyrannous Ma&s;ters, and &s;uch proud and contemptuous enemies of
<PB REF="10">
the common name of <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> the light of Evangelical Truth is not only dim'd, but utterly extinct, as it has hap|ned in the <HI>Latin</HI> Church in <HI>Africa,</HI> once inferiour to none for purity of Doctrin, and piety and learning in their Profe&s;|&s;ours. Yet this cannot be deny'd them, but that they accord with us in many things wherein we differ from the <HI>Ro|mi&s;h</HI> Church. I may add this more, that in the Sacrament of the Euchari&s;t, the <HI>Greek</HI> Church doth not bear that confor|mity or &s;imilitude with the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church, as the great Champions for <HI>Po|pery</HI> would affix upon them. And that will ea&s;ily appear in the&s;e particulars. 1. They u&s;e not the Elevation of the Ho&s;t. 2. No carrying it in Proce&s;&s;ion. 3. The People &s;tand when they receive it. 4. They give it in both kinds to all. 5. The bread is of a common &s;ort before Con&s;ecration. It is be&s;ides, the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Preface, to enlarge upon the pre&s;ent State of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, which the reverend Author hath in &s;ome mea&s;ure done in his account of <HI>Sa|mos,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos:</HI> And that &s;ubject is more largely handl'd by a late
<PB REF="10">
learned Author <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Smith</HI>'s remarks upon the <HI>Turks.</HI></NOTE> in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongues. All that I &s;hall add is, that &s;carce any part of <HI>Greece</HI> has le&s;s intermixture with the <HI>Turks</HI> than the&s;e I&s;les, where the <HI>Greek</HI> Lan|guage and Religion is le&s;s intrench'd up|on. There are no le&s;s than twenty Bi&s;hops in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> &s;ome with the Title of <HI>Metropolite,</HI> as <HI>Mete|lyn</HI> and <HI>Methymia;</HI> others with the Title of Arch-Bi&s;hop, as <HI>Samos,</HI> and <HI>Andros,</HI> and &s;ome with the bare Title of Bi&s;hop, as <HI>Sciathus.</HI> Yet neither of the two fir&s;t differ from the la&s;t in any thing, but in Title, or priority of Place. Their juri&s;diction is alike, it being ordinary here for a <HI>Metropolite,</HI> and an Arch-Bi&s;hop to be without a <HI>Suffragan.</HI> The rea&s;on is, becau&s;e of the great Revolutions, many of the old Bi&s;hopricks are lo&s;t, and the ancient frame of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Polity much alter'd. The Patriarch continues the Title of <HI>Metropolite</HI> upon all the places that formerly were &s;o, and the litle of Arch-Bi&s;hop, upon tho&s;e that depend immediately upon the Patriarch, with|out any &s;ubjection to a <HI>Metropolite,</HI>
<PB REF="11">
although they have no Bi&s;hop under their juri&s;diction. The following Trea|ti&s;e giveth an account of three I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> and Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> the Great <HI>Academy</HI> for the <HI>Greek</HI> Clergy. In all the&s;e places, he liv'd, and writes nothing, but what he &s;aw, or what he receiv'd from the con&s;tant Tradition of the places: So that as to matters of fact, he may be better rely'd upon than tho&s;e that write of places to which they are great &s;tran|gers. For the Truth of what is rela|ted, is the main <HI>Po&s;tulatum</HI> of an Hi|&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION Of the ISLE of SAMOS: AND <HI>Of its pre&s;ent State at this Day.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_SAmos,</HI> is one of the greate&s;t, and mo&s;t re|markable I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> &s;itu|ate near the Conti|nent of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> It is well known that this was the Coun|try of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and once was Go|vern'd by Kings of her own, and has made &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t <HI>Athens,</HI> what time they both liv'd under a Democratical Government. The ruins which yet are to be &s;een
<PB N="2" REF="12">
there are a Te&s;timony of her former greatne&s;s and wealth. But this I&s;land hath been &s;ubject to great changes and revolutions, even to utter de&s;ertion of Inhabitants for many Years. Yet it being my main intent to give an account of its pre&s;ent State, I &s;hall wave the for|mer Tran&s;actions of Ancient times, whereof there is frequent mention among&s;t Hi&s;torians, and proceed to a &s;urvey of its condition in the&s;e Modern Times, under the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire; how it is now Govern'd; what Revenues it yields, with a Geographical De&s;cription of the Country.</P>
<P>It is certain, that what time it pleas'd God for our &s;ins to permit the <HI>Turks</HI> to &s;ubdue <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> the I&s;land of <HI>Samos</HI> was totally di&s;peopl'd. Af|terwards one <HI>Kilitch Aly Ba&s;ha</HI> ar|rived here, and Landing with a &s;mall Company to Hunt, was &s;o taken with the place, that he was re&s;olv'd to ask leave of the Grand Signior, to re-people the I&s;land:
<PB N="3" REF="12">
Which having done, he tran&s;por|ted &s;everal Families from all the Voi&s;inage e&s;pecially from <HI>Metelyne,</HI> &s;o that by degrees, it became full of Inhabitants, and now counts to the number of 18 Towns and Vil|lages, which I &s;hall now de&s;cribe according to their Situation.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Samos</HI> is 26, or 27 <HI>French</HI> Leagues in compa&s;s, and lies in length Ea&s;t and We&s;t. At the We&s;t end it has the I&s;le of <HI>Nicaria,</HI> &s;ome twelve Miles di&s;tant: The Ea&s;t end is &s;o near the Continent of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that in &s;ome places men can Di&s;cour&s;e one with another from the two Shores. This near|ne&s;s of the Ea&s;t end of <HI>Samos</HI> to the Continent of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> cau&s;es a nar|row Frith about &s;ix Miles in length, no where above 3 Miles in breadth, which by rea&s;on of little I&s;lands in it, is a great Ne&s;t of Pirats, whom no Ships that come into this Strait can e&s;cape, but by putting to Shore on each &s;ide, where they are in equal danger of being made a Prey. The&s;e Pirats for the mo&s;t part are
<PB N="4" REF="13">
either from <HI>Malta, Legorn, Savoy,</HI> or <HI>Sardinia.</HI></P>
<P>At the entrance into this Streight, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Dardbogazy, i. e.</HI> The Mouth of the Streight, lies all along the Mountain for the &s;pace of a Mile, the place where the Old City of <HI>Samos</HI> &s;tood, remarkable<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Old</HI> Samos</NOTE> yet for &s;ome remainders of the Walls and ruins of old Churches, and large Stones, &s;ome 3, &s;ome 4, &s;ome 5 yards long, be&s;ides many Marbles and Pillars, notwith&s;tan|ding the many choice pieces carried away by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> when they were Lords of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI> But the <HI>Greeks</HI> at this day dare not touch a Stone, &s;o much as to Build with, for fear of Impri&s;onment by the <HI>Turks,</HI> under colour of having found a Trea&s;ure in tho&s;e old Ruins.</P>
<P>And being once Impri&s;on'd upon &s;uch a pretence, they are &s;ure to lye fa&s;t till all they have be &s;eiz'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Ruins are no le&s;s than &s;ix miles in compa&s;s. Upon the &s;ame Mountain in the middle of a deep and large Grotto, &s;tands a Church

<P>There are be&s;ides the&s;e three al|ready nam'd, a great many little Villages &s;catter'd up and down through the whole I&s;land, which for the number of Hou&s;es, are lar|ger of extent than tho&s;e in <HI>Samos;</HI> for here every Hou&s;e is environ'd with its proper Garden, Orchard; but the Hou&s;es in <HI>Samos</HI> are com|monly built clo&s;er, and their Gar|dens, and Orchards at a greater di&s;tance.</P>

<PB N="60" REF="41">
and difficulty, they force out of &s;o barren a Soil, that little Corn they have; which is not &s;ufficient to feed the Inhabitants above one half the year; and lays a nece&s;&s;ity upon the <HI>Nicarians</HI> to traffick abroad for &s;upplies el&s;ewhere. But principally they trade to <HI>Scio</HI> for Corn, whither they carry Wood from <HI>Samos,</HI> and the neighbouring parts of <HI>Natolia.</HI> They are very expert in making Boats, and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, which are in &s;uch e&s;teem, that they are bought up by all their Neighbours.

<P>The mo&s;t commendable thing of this I&s;land is their Air and Water, both &s;o healthful, that the People are very long liv'd, it being an ordinary thing to &s;ee per&s;ons in it of an 100 years of Age, which is a great wonder, con&s;idering how hardily they live. There is not a Bed in the I&s;land, the Ground is their Tick, and the cold Stone their Pillow, and the Cloaths they wear is all the Coverlet they u&s;e. They provide no more Apparel than what they wear all at once, when that is pa&s;t wearing any lon|ger, then think of a new Suit. Betwixt their ordinary times of
<PB N="62" REF="42">
Eating, there is not a piece of Bread to be found in the I&s;le. A little before Dinner, they take as much Corn as will &s;erve that Meal, grind it with a Hand-Mill, bake it upon a flat Stone; when 'tis Bak'd, the Ma&s;ter of the Fa|mily divides it equally among the Family; but a Woman with child has two &s;hares. If any Stranger comes in, every one parts with a Piece of his own &s;hare to accom|modate the Stranger. Their Wine is always made with a third part Water, and &s;o very weak and &s;mall. When they drink it, &s;o much as is thought &s;ufficient is put into one large Bowl, and &s;o pa&s;&s;es round. The <HI>Nicarians</HI> are the only I&s;landers of all the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> that nei|ther keep Wine to &s;ell, nor lay it up in Wooden Ve&s;&s;els, but in long Jars, cover'd all over in the Ground. When they have a mind to Tap it, they make a Bung-hole in the top, and draw it out with Canes. Their Hou&s;es are &s;o plain, that all the Furniture you can &s;ee is an

Hand-Mill, be&s;ides this, there is nothing but bare Walls: That little they have be&s;ides is all hid under Ground; not &s;o much for fear of the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> (from whom their Po|verty is a &s;ure guard) as out of Cu|&s;tome. Nor are they all &s;o poor, as not to be able to buy Beds, but cu&s;tom has brought them into a contempt of Beds, as meerly &s;uper|fluous; in&s;omuch, that when they Travel into other I&s;lands, they refu&s;e the offer of a Bed. A Prie&s;t of <HI>Nicaria</HI> coming into <HI>Samos,</HI> was courteou&s;ly entertain'd by tho&s;e of his Order, and at Night was of|fer'd a Bed to lye in; he thank'd them, but refus'd, nor could by any importunity be prevail'd upon, but told them the Earth was his Mother, from whence he would not keep a di&s;tance; be&s;ides he was afraid of being Sick, if he &s;hould lye in a Bed; and therefore if they had a kindne&s;s for him, they mu&s;t give him the liberty of &s;leeping after his own Country way.</P>
<P>When I went to vi&s;it them as
<PB N="64" REF="43">
Arch-Bi&s;hop, and ignorant of the cu&s;tom of the Country, carry'd no Bed. At Night, where I fir&s;t lodg'd, asking for a Chamber, they told me they had no other than that where I fir&s;t came; then asking for a Bed, they told me it was not the Cu&s;tom of the Country; then de|&s;iring to borrow &s;ome Bed Cloaths for Love or Money, all they brought me was one Smock made of cour&s;e Dimity.</P>
<P>They have no great communi|cation one with another, any far|ther than the publick times of Sa|cred Solemnities, or Civil Bu&s;ine&s;s doth cau&s;e them to come together. At other times they keep &s;trictly within the narrow Sphere of their own affairs. Formal Vi&s;its, Treats, and Entertainments, are things un|known. If any bu&s;ine&s;s do put them upon a Vi&s;it to their Neigh|bour, they come not clo&s;e to his Door, but &s;tand off at a great di|&s;tance, and call aloud to him; If he make them an&s;wer, they di&s;|cour&s;e the Bu&s;ine&s;s they came about,

&s;tanding off at the &s;ame di&s;tance; except they be earne&s;tly invited to come in. And this way of di&s;|cour&s;ing at a di&s;tance they practice more in the Fields and Mountains; their Voices being &s;o &s;trong, that 'tis ordinary to talk at a Miles di|&s;tance; &s;ometimes at four or five, where the Valleys interpos'd be|tween two hills, give advantage to the Voice. Sometimes they can di&s;cour&s;e at that di&s;tance, that the carriage of the Sound through the Winding of the Valleys, &s;hall re|quire half a Quarter of an Hours time; and yet they make di&s;tinct, and proper An&s;wers, both audible and intelligible, without the help of a <HI>Stentorophonical</HI> Trumpet.</P>
<P>Their Habit for the Men, is a Shirt, and over it a &s;hort Ca&s;&s;ock, down to the Knees, to which, in Winter they add only a &s;hort Ve&s;t, that reaches a little below the mid|dle. Stockings they never wear. There Shoes are only a piece of thin Copper, bow'd to the &s;hape of their Feet, and every one is his

own Shoe-maker. The Women have nothing but one Smock, but &s;o large, that they wrap it double, or treble down to the Girdle, but below the Girdle &s;ingle. The Prie&s;ts, for greater reverence in the Church, ty two Towels about their Legs, the one is their u&s;ual Bonnet, and the other their Girdle: &s;o that they perform &s;acred Offices un|guirt, as well as uncover'd.</P>
<P>Of all the I&s;les of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> this only admits of no mixture with &s;trangers in Marriage, nor admits any &s;tranger to &s;ettle with them: They being, as they pretend, all de|&s;cended of the Imperial Blood of the <HI>Porphyrogenneti,</HI> mu&s;t not &s;tain their noble Blood with inferiour Matches, or mixtures with <HI>Choriats,</HI> or Pea&s;ants, for &s;o they term all the other I&s;landers.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION Of the ISLE of PATMOS.</HEAD>
<P>THe I&s;le of <HI>Patmos,</HI> now call'd <HI>Patino,</HI> is 36 Miles in com|pa&s;s, 40 Miles from the Continent of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> towards <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> as many Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Samos</HI> North Ea&s;t of it; 30 from <HI>Nicaria,</HI> North; 60 from <HI>Paros,</HI> and <HI>Naxos,</HI> We&s;t; 60 from <HI>Amurgos,</HI> South.</P>
<P>The Figure is neither round nor &s;quare, but irregular, by rea&s;on of unequal Promontories and Bays. It is furni&s;h'd with very commodi|ous Havens, to which it owes its being inhabited, though not &s;o well as in former times, as appears by the many and great Ruins in it.</P>

of <HI>Ne&s;tia,</HI> and named it <HI>Rouvali.</HI> But not liking the place, (and as the Tradition goes, being warned by a Vi&s;ion, and a Voice from Hea|ven,) he quitted that Mona&s;try, and built another in the highe&s;t part of the I&s;land, and fortifi'd it with a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, environ'd with high and &s;trong Walls: And there he built a Church.

In pro|ce&s;s of time, the&s;e Huts were chang'd into fair Hou&s;es, and by Trade and Commerce, became a great Town, to the number of 800 Hou&s;es, and there Inhabited by rich Merchants, that traded in|to all parts. But the many Revo|lutions that have happen'd &s;ince, have eclips'd the former Glory of the place: And their Ships of Mer|chandi&s;e are all dwindl'd into &s;mall Fi&s;her Boats, and the Inhabitants are all extremely poor.</P>

<P>Pa&s;s we now to the Hermitages, which are very &s;mall, but common|ly &s;o neer one another, as to make the appearance of a Village.

by Manufacture, as particularly, the making of Cro&s;&s;es and Figures that repre&s;ent our Saviours Pa&s;&s;ion, and Seals and Marks proper for the con&s;ecrated Bread. The <HI>Caloirs</HI> that are &s;ent abroad to confe&s;s Peo|ple, and to gather Alms for pious U&s;es, buy up all the&s;e Manufactures to pre&s;ent unto people among whom they come. The&s;e Hermits live more retired and melancholly, being not above two or three, &s;ome|times but one in an Hou&s;e. And they do imitate the Lives of tho&s;e antient Monks in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> about <HI>Thebais,</HI> that were imitators of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> who did him&s;elf, as did all his followers, live and main|tain them&s;elves by hand labour and manufactures, though of a very mean &s;ort, yet enough to earn them Food and Raiment. This St. <HI>An|thony</HI> was the fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Monk of the World, his Food was only Bread and Water; yet he liv'd 150 years: His fame was &s;o great, that <HI>Helen,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, did by letters &s;ent to him,

recommend Her &s;elf and her Son to his Prayers. He dy'd in the Wil|derne&s;s. <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 361. 2. <HI>Kera|&s;ia,</HI> another plot of Ground, all &s;trew'd with &s;uch Hermitages as are at St. <HI>Aine,</HI> and they live in the very &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Hermitages that lye &s;o neer in voi&s;inage, there are above 1000 more di&s;per&s;ed up and down the I&s;land, which do all be|long to &s;ome one of the Mona&s;tries. If a Man de&s;ire to live in a Cell, he gives a certain Rate to that Mona|&s;try to which it belongs, and &s;o is empowr'd to enjoy that Cell, and the Land belonging to't for his life: when he dies, it returns to the Mo|na&s;try, and the Mona&s;try is Heir to all that he leaves behind him. There are Cells of all rates, from 5 Dol|lers to 150. One thing is very re|markable, that Idlene&s;s is utterly bani&s;h'd here, no man lives in the I&s;le, who is not &s;ome way employ'd.</P>
<P>As for the maintenance of the&s;e Mona&s;tries, though their Lands be &s;ufficient to &s;eed them, and their
<PB REF="60">
Mountain furni&s;h them with Wine enough to drink; yet as the matter is order'd, they commonly want Money to pay their <HI>Haratch,</HI> or yearly Tribute of 3 Dollers <HI>per</HI> Poll, and buy them&s;elves Cloaths and Furniture for tilling their Land. So that every year they &s;elect &s;ome of their <HI>Caloirs</HI> to go abroad, and beg the Charity of <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> People, towards the relief of the re&s;pective Mona&s;try. And the&s;e are always by two and two together. And the Mona&s;tries agree before-hand to what particular places they will &s;end their re&s;pective Emi&s;&s;aries, who continue ordinarily two or three years in their perambulation. At their coming home, the Money is delivered to the <HI>Skenaphylax,</HI> or the Steward of the Mona&s;try; for it is again&s;t the Rule of their Order, to meddle with Money. He layes it out upon nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, and what is left, is kept to defray the Charge of another Voyage. They have a Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e that be&s;tow any thing, and they pray for
<PB N="100" REF="61">
them con&s;tantly in the Mona&s;try.</P>
<P>When they are cho&s;en to go abroad, the Chief of the Mona|&s;try names one of the <HI>Caloirs:</HI> The Per&s;on named, in token of his obedience, doth pro&s;trate him&s;elf on the Ground before the Superiour of the Mona&s;try, and ri&s;ing, ki&s;&s;es the Superiours hand. Then the Per&s;on fir&s;t nam'd, names tho&s;e that &s;hall go along with him, who in like obedience, fir&s;t pro&s;trate them|&s;elves before the Superiour, and ki&s;s his hand, then do the like to the <HI>Caloir</HI> fir&s;t nam'd by the Con|vent, and own him for their Father and Superiour, to whom they owe all obedience during their mi&s;&s;ion. When they go abroad, they fir&s;t ap|ply them&s;elves to the <HI>Metropolite</HI> of the Dioce&s;e, and &s;hew him their Letters of Obedience from their Superiours. Whereupon the <HI>Me|tropolite</HI> gives them Letters of Per|mi&s;&s;ion to ask Charity, and confe&s;s Penitents throughout his Dioce&s;e. Where they Confe&s;s any, they exact nothing of them by way of pecu|niary
<PB N="101" REF="61">
Penance, but only receive what in charity they freely be&s;tow.</P>
<P>The beginning of Monks in Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> was from the time that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> invaded <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> where the Monks in tho&s;e places enjoying no &s;ecurity of their lives, came into <HI>Gyeece,</HI> and de&s;ired of the Emperour a Place to live in, according to their Mona|&s;tick way. He appointed them Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> &s;ore|mention'd, was the fir&s;t that foun|ded a College here. They profe&s;|&s;ed at fir&s;t the imitation of St. <HI>An|thony</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and St. <HI>Sabas;</HI> but now the Rules of their Order are taken from St. <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI></P>
<P>At their fir&s;t coming to Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> they were a Colony of the Monks of the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> who fol|low'd the Rules of St. <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and St. <HI>Sabas;</HI> but chiefly the Rules of St. <HI>Sabas,</HI> who liv'd long after St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> when Monkery began to alter its mode and fa&s;hion, and from a ca&s;ual Retirement of &s;ome few men to a rude and &s;imple
<PB N="102" REF="62">
way of life in the Wilderne&s;s, to become &s;ubject to Rules and Orders, to incorporate into Societies, to change their Caves into Cloi&s;ters, and to remove from De&s;erts to good dwelling Hou&s;es, and places of better convenience and accommo|dation. This St. <HI>Sabas,</HI> by his emi|nent and &s;ingular &s;trictne&s;s, did highly advance the Fame and Ad|miration of a Mona&s;tick life. He was by birth a <HI>Cappadocian,</HI> of the Village of <HI>Mutala&s;ca,</HI> in the Dioce&s;e of <HI>Cae&s;area,</HI> and being left Heir to a good E&s;tate, under the Care of his Uncle <HI>Hermias,</HI> the perver&s;ene&s;s of his Aunt made him quit that Uncles Hou&s;e, and go to <HI>Scandos,</HI> to live with another Uncle, who&s;e name was <HI>Gregory.</HI> This breeding a Di&s;&s;ention between the two Un|cles, he, to avoid all occa&s;ion of di&s;|cord, betook him&s;elf to the Mona|&s;try of <HI>Flavianae</HI> near <HI>Mutala&s;ca;</HI> whence at the eighteenth year of his Age, he went to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to vi&s;it tho&s;e places which our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviours life and death hath made
<PB N="103" REF="62">
&s;o memorable. At that time the Fame of <HI>Euthymius,</HI> then Abbot of <HI>Laura</HI> by <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> was very great in the <HI>Holy Land.</HI> This enflam'd young <HI>Sabas</HI> with great de&s;ire to be admitted into his Mona&s;try: Wherefore one day as <HI>Euthymius</HI> was going to receive the Sacrament, he fell down at his feet, begging leave to be entred into his College: But <HI>Euthymius</HI> gave him the Repul&s;e, tel|ling him it was not fitting that &s;o young a Man &s;hould be admitted into <HI>Laura;</HI> yet he would recom|mend him to a &s;maller Mona&s;try hard by, where St. <HI>Theocti&s;tes</HI> was Abbot: Where having &s;tay'd ten years, <HI>Euthymius</HI> admitted him in|to a Cave by his own Mona&s;try for five years. Then <HI>Euthymius</HI> &s;elected him, and <HI>Domitian</HI> to vye <HI>asketick</HI> Severities in a &s;olitary Place for four years, which having perform'd to great admiration, about the For|tieth year of his Age he retir'd to a Cave by the Brook of <HI>Siloe.</HI> By that time he had liv'd here five years he had a College of Di&s;ciples, to

the number of 70, among&s;t whom was <HI>John</HI> the Silentiary, Bi&s;hop of <HI>Colonia</HI> in <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> before he en|tred into his Mona&s;tick life, and afterwards Abbot of this College, which was call'd <HI>Nova Laura.</HI> There were afterwards more Mona&s;tries of this name in <HI>Palae&s;tin.

He was eminent in the time of <HI>Ana&s;ta|&s;ius, Ju&s;tinus,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tinianus,</HI> Em|perours of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and dy'd in the 94^t^h year of his Age. His name is yet very remarkable among the Ea&s;tern <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> e&s;pecially at Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> who&s;e fir&s;t Monks were but a Colony of his Di&s;ciples, and who&s;e anciente&s;t College is cal|led <HI>Laura,</HI> from his <HI>Laura</HI> in <HI>Palae&s;tine.</HI></P>
<P>Their con&s;tant morning Prayer is three hours before day; their

<P>They that enter into this profe&s;|&s;ion, are kept &s;ix months Proba|tioners; during which time they are put to all the Exerci&s;e they mu&s;t undergo in their Profe&s;&s;ion.

This God-father brings him to the Church door, where he is &s;trip'd to his Shirt, and pro&s;trates him&s;elf, then he makes a &s;econd pro&s;tration in the middle of the Church, and a third at the Altar, and a fourth to the Superiour.
