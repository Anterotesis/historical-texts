<P>_WHereas the Safeguard and Protection We owe to &s;uch of Our own Subjects, and to all others in League and Amity with Vs, as pa&s;s and repa&s;s the Seas belonging to the&s;e Our Kingdoms, hath been always a principal part of Our Royal Care and Concern; And whereas We find already, that the Freedom and Security of Navigation and Com|merce to and fro Our Ports (in this time of Ho&s;tility between Our Neighbour Princes) hath been much di&s;turbed; Nay, the Reverence due to Our Ports, Harbours, and other Places under Our own immediate Protection, hath been violated by the Piratical Practices, Depredations and In&s;olencies of Private Men of War, and others pretending Commi&s;&s;ion for the pre&s;ent Ho&s;tilities: We have thought fit, by the Advice of Our Privy Council, after an exact view fir&s;t taken of the Rules, Ordinances and Provi&s;ions made upon the like occa&s;ions by Our Royal Progenitors, to re|vive, e&s;tabli&s;h, ratifie and publi&s;h to all the World the&s;e Rules and Ordinances following. Our Royal Will and Plea&s;ure therefore is,</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="I"> That within our Ports, Havens, Roads, and Creeks, as al&s;o in every other Place or Tract at Sea, that may be rea&s;onably con&s;trued to be within any of tho&s;e Denominations, Limits or Precincts, there &s;hall be an inviolable Truce and Ce&s;&s;ation of all Ho&s;tilities between all Per&s;ons and Parties what&s;oever; And that no Force, Violence, Surpri&s;e, or Offence &s;hall be done either from Man of War to Man of War, or from Man of War to Merchant, or from Merchant to Merchant, that happen to be in Ho&s;tility the one again&s;t the other; But that all of what Nation or Party &s;oever, &s;o long as they &s;hall be within Our Ports, Harbours, or other Places reputed to be within Our more im|mediate Protection, and where Our Commanders and Officers are accomptable for the Publick Peace, &s;hall be under&s;tood to be under Our &s;pecial Safe-conduct, and mu&s;t keep the Peace inviolably each with other: And We do further declare, and hereby denounce, That the Ships and Goods of all Aggre&s;&s;ors, Actors and Offenders what&s;oever again&s;t the true meaning of this Our Ordinance and Proclamation, are and &s;hall be <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> Confi&s;cate, and proceeded again&s;t in Our High Court of Admiralty, to Sentence and Condemnation, according to Law, notwith&s;tanding any Commi&s;&s;ion of War, or Letters of Reprizals &s;uch Offenders may have, or pretend to have for their Iu&s;tification.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"> We Will and Command that all Our Officers and Subjects by Sea and Land, do, as much as in them lies, prohibit the Hoving and Hover|ing of Men of War &s;o near the Entry of any of Our Harbours, or Our Coa&s;ts, as that Merchant men homeward or outward bound to or fro any of Our Ports &s;hall apprehend their Pa&s;&s;age to be un&s;afe, or their danger of being &s;et upon and &s;urpri&s;ed apparent, to the hindering and diverting of Trade and Commerce from Our Ports: And We do &s;traitly charge and require Our &s;aid Officers and Subjects to re&s;cue, &s;uccour, and defend all Merchant men and others that &s;hall happen to be &s;et upon or &s;urpri&s;ed &s;o near Our Coa&s;ts, or the Entry of Our Harbours, as may be ea&s;ily con&s;trued to be under Our more &s;pecial Care and Protection; and that they apprehend and &s;ei&s;e all Offend|ers in this kind, in order to bring them to condign puni&s;hment, for di&s;turbing and hindering the Trade and Commerce between Our Subjects and tho&s;e of Our Neighbours and Allies.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P><MILESTONE N="III"> That where it happens that a Man of War of the one party, come into any of Our Ports where there &s;hall be a Merchant-man (one or more) of the other Party, &s;uch Merchant Ship or Ships, if they de&s;ire it, &s;hall be &s;uffered to depart the Port two Tydes before the Man of War, to the intent they may get them&s;elves out of his Reach and Pur&s;uit: And if it happen that any Man of War (one or more) of the one Party do come in, while any Man (or Men) of War of the other Party are in Our Ports or Roads, none &s;hall be &s;uffered to go out to Sea the &s;ame Tyde with his Enemy; but tho&s;e that are mo&s;t likely to pur&s;ue and engage as &s;oon as they are out of Our Ports, &s;hall be &s;tayed and detained two Tydes after tho&s;e of the adver&s;e Party are put to Sea.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="IV"> And We do hereby charge and require all Vice-Admirals, Cu&s;tomers, and other Our Officers in Ports and Maritime Places, that they vi&s;it all Ships and Ve&s;&s;els belonging to Our Subjects, that &s;hall Victual, Furni&s;h or Recruit them&s;elves for Voyages at Sea; And that they &s;tay and detain all &s;uch as they &s;hall &s;u&s;pect by the Provi&s;ion or Furniture to be de&s;igned for any other then Trading, or Fi&s;hing Voyages, until further Order from Vs, or Our Deare&s;t Brother <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> Our High Admiral, in that behalf.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="V"> And We do further &s;traitly command and require all Governours and Officers in Ports and other Maritime Places, not to &s;uffer any Private Man of War Sailing by a Foreign Commi&s;&s;ion, and having any Prize or Prizes (that he may have taken) in his power and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, to &s;tay above twenty four hours in any of Our Ports or Harbours, unle&s;s he be thereto con&s;trained by contrary Winds, blocking up by Enemies, or other Di&s;tre&s;s; yet &s;o that during his &s;tay he do not break Bulk, &s;ell, barter, or leave behind him any of his Prize-goods, upon any terms or pretence what&s;oever: And We further require Our Officers and Subjects, not to interpo&s;e or meddle in the affairs and pro|ceedings of &s;uch Men of War as put into Our Ports upon any Di&s;tre&s;s, with Foreign Commi&s;&s;ions, but to &s;uffer them to carry away their Prizes whither them&s;elves think fit; Provided they have not the Goods or Merchandi&s;es of any of Our own Subjects on Board &s;uch Prizes; which if they happen to have, Our meaning is, That they be upon due proof taken out and re&s;tored to the true Proprietors.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="VI"> We do &s;traitly Require and Command, That none of Our Subjects of what degree or condition &s;oever, do pre&s;ume to Buy, Contract, or deal with any Foreign Men of War, their Officers or Company, or with any other per&s;on coming from Sea, not being a known Merchant, for any Wares, Merchandi&s;es, Victuals, Ammunition, Tackle, Furniture, Provi&s;ions or Goods what&s;oever, not brought in by the cour&s;e of Merchandi&s;e, and the Cu&s;toms and Duties upon them fir&s;t paid, upon pain of forfeiting all &s;uch Wares and Goods, as <HI>Bona Pirata|rum</HI> ought to be, and of being further proceeded again&s;t and puni&s;hed in Our High Court of Admiralty, as Abetters and Complices of Pirates, and as Receivers of Pirates and their Goods, ought to be by the Laws and Cu&s;toms of the Sea in that behalf.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="VII"> And whereas divers of Our Subjects, out of their inclinations to Rapine and Licencious cour&s;es, rather then to Trading Voyages, and other hone&s;t Imployments at home, do engage, &s;ome of the one &s;ide, and &s;ome of the other, in the Quarrels of Our Neighbour Princes now in War, without Our leave or permi&s;&s;ion; We do hereby &s;traitly Command and Require, That no Officer or Mariner what|&s;oever being Our Subject, do pre&s;ume to put him&s;elf into the Martial Service of any Foreign Prince or State, or accept of, and execute any Commi&s;&s;ion of War, or Letter of Marque or Reprizal from any &s;uch Prince or State, or go in any Merchant or Fi&s;hing Voyage, in any other Ship or Ve&s;&s;el then &s;uch as belong to Our own Subjects, without leave from Our Self, or Our deare&s;t Brother <HI>James</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> Our High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> in due form fir&s;t obtained. And We do hereby Charge and Command all Officers, Mari|ners and Seafaring-men what&s;oever, that are now in any &s;uch Service, to leave the &s;ame forthwith, and to get their Appearance and Return to their native Countrey, Recorded in Our High Court of Admiralty, or before &s;ome of Our Officers thereunto Impowered, upon pain of be|ing reputed and puni&s;hed as Pirates. And in ca&s;e any Officer or Mariner neglecting to return upon the&s;e Our Summons, happen at any time hereafter to come into any Port or Place of Our Dominions, We do hereby Charge and Require all Vice-Admirals, and Our Offi|cers in Ports and Maritime places, to apprehend and &s;ei&s;e &s;uch per&s;on or per&s;ons, and him or them &s;o &s;ei&s;ed, to Commit to the next Goal, there to remain until further Order, and the Certificate thereof to return with all &s;peed into Our High Court of Admiralty, to the end that the Offender or Offenders may be proceeded again&s;t according to the Laws of this Our Realm in that behalf provided.</P>
