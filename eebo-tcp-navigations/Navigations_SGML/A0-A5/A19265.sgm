<P>_THough I v&s;e not (more the~ briefe notes) to write my &s;ermons (yet right wor&s;hip|full) for that of &s;ome of your godly religious chil|dren, I was more then earne&s;tly entrea|ted to &s;et downe this Sermon, my &s;imple newyeares gift (be&s;towed in comon a|mong&s;t you) I after lo~ger &s;ute then there was great cau&s;e, graunted, and haue pen|ned downe the &s;ame, &s;o neare as I can
<PB REF="3"> call to my memory the manner of my &s;peche. The order and di&s;po&s;ition I haue exactly ob&s;erued, and not omitted any note or authoritie of &s;cripture by me then alledged. And as it is vnpo&s;&s;ible for him that penneth not his Sermons, to &s;et them downe, euen &s;o, and with the &s;elfe &s;ame words in all places as he &s;pake them: So to all my po&s;&s;ibilitie haue I performed as neare as may be my order and &s;peech. And &s;ome thing haue I ad|ded in &s;ome place, which want of tyme trained me from at that pre&s;ent. And if any le&s;&s;e ye nowe lyke then when you herde the &s;ame, con&s;ider then the diffe|rence betwixt reading &amp; preaching the &s;elfe &s;ame truth, and matter.

<P>_RIght wor&s;hipfull and dearely beloued brethren, it hath from auncient dayes bene receaued, that in the fir&s;t of the newe yeare, eache friende doth &s;alute his other with &s;ome token of friend&s;hip, and ther|with wi&s;heth to &s;uch his friende all helth &amp; good pro&s;peritie in God. Which cyuill cu&s;tome in <HI>Newyeares gyfts,</HI> I do allowe in ciuill &s;ort, and hauing &s;o many freinds here a&s;&s;embled, haue purpo&s;ed, to benefite you all at once, and with &s;uche a &s;peciall gift as of euery of you (the &s;ame being worthely receaued) I &s;hall be deemed to haue &s;ati&s;fied my office belo~ging my bou~|den amitie to you all. The gift I exhibit is a portion of Gods heauenly <HI>trea&s;ure,</HI> fully &s;ufficient from this fir&s;t day of the yeare to enriche you aboue mea&s;ure in Chri&s;t, &s;o that you v&s;e the &s;ame wyth the &s;pirituall in&s;trument of faithfull and obe|dient practi&s;e, continually in your hartes.

<P>I purpo&s;e (hauing thus by prayer cal|led vpo~ god) to giue you the P&s;al. by ver|&s;es, and of euery of them &s;uch comfortable le&s;&s;ons, as the Lorde in mercy &s;hall gyue me to vtter vnto your Chri&s;tian hartes, and with as much breuitie as may be, be|cau&s;e of the extreme cold, that &s;o we may more &s;peedely approche the Lordes holy Table to receiue his heauenly my&s;teries.</P>
<P><HI>The Lord is my &s;heperd. &amp;c.</HI> The prophet
<PB REF="5"> calleth his God a <HI>&s;hepherd,</HI> becau&s;e of his prouident care ouer him one of his cho|&s;en lambes, which word <HI>(&s;heperd)</HI> impor|teth an office of continual feeding, of day|ly care, of ferue~t loue to the flocke vnder his charge, of watching, guiding and de|fending, to the be&s;t &s;afety of his &s;heepe.

<PB REF="5"> I make thine enemies thy foote&s;tole.</HI> In which place Dauid calleth Chri&s;t his lord, which is to h&s;m &amp; to all y^e cho&s;en children of god the appointed &s;heperd of their &s;oules, as Chri&s;t him &s;elfe doth witnes, &s;aying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 10.11.</NOTE> <HI>J am the good &s;heperd,</HI> the good &s;heperde giueth his lyfe for his &s;heepe.

He mu&s;t haue &s;kill in pa&s;turing his &s;heepe, lea&s;t he bring them to rotten &s;oyle, and wa&s;ting gra&s;&s;e. In Chri&s;te is the onely pa&s;ture of mans &s;oule, in whom all &s;afetie of foode is, for his glorious go&s;pel is our heauen|ly foode, his &s;pirite &amp; life is our cele&s;tiall diet, &amp; by the mouth of our faith, this our bread of lyfe is of euery of vs that beleue, firmely eaten, and the &s;ame is &s;o &s;ounde and &s;weete pa&s;ture, that no rot and death can come vnto the worthy fieldes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 5.24.</NOTE> or any le&s;&s;e able is yt then his

Thirdly a good &s;heperde mu&s;t haue will to feede according to his &s;kill, that &s;o his &s;heepe may not be pyned for want of his louing paynes: So Chri&s;t is mo&s;t louing of all others to feede his lambes, who hath not &s;pared to lay downe his lyfe for the foode of his &s;heepe. willing to feede, for he calleth all men to hym for pa&s;ture. mo&s;t carefull of their diet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Io. 10.15.

Further a good Sheperd taketh greate eare ouer his &s;heepe, and vigilantly doth &s;earch if &s;o any of them &s;kabbe, or be in|fected, and finding them faultie, hee ad|dre&s;&s;eth him &s;elfe to their amendment: &s;o Chri&s;te our Lorde doth dearely care ouer his flocke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act. 20.28. Luke. 15.4 5.</NOTE> they be to him as the apple of his eye for them he hath payd the price of their &s;ynne, and deadly di&s;ea&s;e, namely

And now dearely beloued, tyme and place re|quireth to &s;peake &s;omething of y^e &s;heepes propertie, which belong to that &s;heperde

<P>But els the naturall &s;heepe hath qua|lities right good, which are frequented in the children of God, they know their Pa&s;tors why&s;tle, and thereat they yelde vnto his will. So the &s;heepe of Chr&s;te refu&s;ing all &s;traunge voyce, they herken vnto y^e word of our &s;auiour Chri&s;t, &amp; ther|in
