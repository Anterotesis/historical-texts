<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE HENRY LORD
CARY, Viscount of Faulkland, Controller of
his Maiesties household, and one of his Ma|iesties
most Honourable priuie
Councell.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>RIGHT HONOVRABLE:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe Plantation of <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
to which my former Discourse,
(not vnknown to your Lordship)
as a Harbinger hath in part alrea|dy
chalked out the way, and so
farre preuailed with the cleere|nesse
and solidity of your iudge|ment,
that lying on the naturall truth of my reasons, I
am confident there need no second motiues to con|firme
your <HI>Honours</HI> approbation of my first; seeing the
same hath been approued by the Lords of his Maiesties
most Honourable priuie Councell, as a Worke both
profitable and necessary for his Maiesties Kingdomes
in generall: But because the affections and resolutions
of men doe sometimes freeze, in stead of heating, and
most decline, when, to the eye of the world, they seeme
most to aduance; I haue therefore aduentured to forti|fie
and assist my former printed discourse, with this se|cond;
<PB REF="3">
and by vnfolding other reasons vnto all such as
are willing to be Aduenturers in your pretended pur|pose,
whereby to make it apparent that the said Planta|tion
beares its perswasion with it: yea, that it hath all
the grounds, and runnes on all the feet of good pro|babilities,
as <HI>Religion, Honour, Empire,</HI> and <HI>Profit.</HI> For it
wil propagate <HI>Christians,</HI> where there are as yet but few.
It wil adorne the Crown of our Soueraigne with a spa|cious
Continent: yea, it will empty England of many
people, which may so well be spared, and yeerely reple|nish
it with abundance of treasure, which it so much
wanteth. And although my insuing Discourse be plain,
yet I affirmatiuely auerre, it is true: for as I haue de|lighted
in the latitude of matter, and not in the altitude
of words; so I haue written it out of my certaine ex|perience
and knowledge, and not out of any borrowed
speculation; as hauing many yeeres, with much labour,
industry and cost, played the practicke part in that
Countrey, as well as the theoricke: and therfore know
well how to reduce my former contemplation, into fu|ture
action, as it may partly appeare by representing
your Lordships seuerall Circuits of land in that Coun|trey
(to the open view) in her natiue and naturall co|lours,
and by proposing and discouering the meanes
how, and where the Plantation may bee made firme,
flourishing, and profitable, to all such as will aduenture
therein. Now as you haue vndertaken it with much
zeale and iudgement, so I no wayes doubt, but you will
be the meanes to establish and settle it with renowne
and profit. And euen as little Pinnaces doe often looke
when the greater Ships will weigh Anchor, whereby
they may passe with the more safety vnder their con|duct,
vnto their wished Port: So the eyes of many sub|iects
<PB REF="3">
doe reioyce, that your Honour giues spirit and life
to this Plantation, whereby they may bee imployed
therein. For mine owne part, I haue receiued many
testimonies of fauour from your hands, during my long
attendance at Court herein: although, as yet, the
Subiects are not possest with my bookes, whereby they
may bee informed of the validity of the reasons they
containe for the establishing of this Plantation. And
thus I humbly present these my endeuours, as a thank|full
expression and acknowledgement in part of such
great fauours, as I haue already receiued from your
hands, vntill the prouidence of God, and the pleasure
of his Maiesty command mee to make tryall of what
my two discoueries and narrations haue proposed and
promised. Thus with hearty desire vnto the Almighty
for your long life, with increase of great honour, and
happinesse, I will euer remaine.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_GOod Reader, I haue, in my former printed Dis|course,
laid open a discouery of the <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
and purpose (in this my second
labours, to acquaint all Vndertakers of that
Plantation, what particular profit may re|downd
to themselues and posterities, and what honours
(through their industry) will accrew to the English Nation;
Beare therefore, I beseech thee, with my rough stile, and plain
meaning, in which I striue rather to shew truth in her owne
brightnesse, then to heape applause or glory to my selfe. To
crowne that Countrey of <HI>New-found-land</HI> with due praises,
that she may (by the approbation and fauour of his Maiesty)
be iustly called a Sister-land to this great Iland of <HI>Britannia,
Ireland, Virginia, New-England,</HI> and <HI>Noua-Scotia:</HI>
And that she may claime her selfe this bold and honourable
Title, the world, I thinke, will bee on her side, especially be|cause
she, from her owne mouth, doth shew what infinite and
vnspeakable benefits for many yeeres together, the negotiati|on
of our Kingdome with her, hath brought to all our people,
not onely by the increrse of Mariners and shipping, but by
inriching of many a subiect, and so consequently by the re|lieuing
of many thousands of families, which else had liued
in miserable wants for lacke of honest imployments; Our
English Nation, hauing more then fourescore yeeres together,
made thriuing and profitable Voyages to that Countrey, the
possession whereof began in our late Soueraigne of happy me|mory,
Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and so continues more strongly
<PB REF="4">
now in his Maiesty, without the claime, interest, or authori|ty
of any other Prince.</P>
<P>Touching the Iland it selfe: It lyeth a great part thereof
more to the South then 47. degrees of North-latitude, which
is fiue degrees neerer the Equinoctiall line, then the City of
London: the distance of it on this side from the Continent of
America, bearing the same proportion that England doth
to the neerest part of France, and lyeth neere the course, and
halfe the way betweene Ireland and Virginia.</P>
<P>This proper and commodious situation of the place, toge|ther
with the correspondency of benefits, which not only Eng|land,
but Scotland, and Ireland may, and doe receiue from
the same, filles me more with an ardent desire, so to haue her
stiled, a Sister-land. And worthily may that Royalty be be|stowed
vpon her: For as great Brittaine hath euer been a
cherishing nurse and mother to other forraigne sonnes and
daughters, feeding them with the milke of her plenty, and
fatting them at her brests, when they haue been euen starued
at their owne: Euen so hath this worthy Countrey of <HI>New-found-land</HI>
from time to time giuen free and liberall enter|tainment
to all that desired her blessings: and chiefly (aboue
all other Nations) to the English. What receiue wee from the
hands of our owne Countrey, which in most bountious man|ner,
we haue not had, or may haue at hers? Nay, what can
the world yeeld, to the sustentation of man, which is not in her
to be gotten? Desire you wholesome ayre (the very food of
life?) It is there: shall any Land powre in abundant heapes of
nourishments &amp; necessaries before you? There you haue them:
What seas so abounding in fish, what shores so replenished with
fresh and sweet waters? The wants of other Kingdomes are
not felt heere, and those prouisions which many Countryes
want, are from thence supplied. How much is Spaine, France,
Portugall, Italy, and other places beholding to this noble part
<PB REF="5">
of the world for fish and other commodities, it is to be admi|red.
Let the Dutch report what sweetnesse they haue suckt
from her by trade thither, in buying of fish from our Nation.
And (albeit all the rest should be dumbe) the voyces of them
are as Trumpets lowd enough, to make England fall more and
more in loue with such a sister-land. I will not wearie thee
(good Reader) with leading thee to those famous, faire, and
profitable riuers, nor to those delightfull, large and inestima|ble
woods, neither ouer all those fruitfull and inticing hils,
and delightfull vallies, there to hawke and hunt, where there
is neither Clowne, nor sauage people to hinder thy sports.
They are such, that in so small a piece of paper, as now my loue
salutes thee with, I cannot fully set them downe as they de|serue:
and therefore intreat thee, with iudgement, with pati|ence,
and with desire, for the benefit of they Countrey, to reade
ouer this Discourse, which I trust may incourage thee to fur|ther
so hopefull a Plantation, as it appeareth to bee, and also
giue thee ample satisfaction, and iust cause to answere op|posers,
if any out of ignorance, or other sinister respect, shall
seeke to hinder so honourable and worthy designes. So wishing
thee all happinesse, I rest</P>

<HEAD>A LOVING IN|VITATION
TO ALL
his Maiesties louing Subiects,
for their generall good.</HEAD>
<P>_SEeing it hath pleased the Kings most ex|cellent
Maiesty, long since, to grant a Pa|tent
vnto some right Honourable and
right worshipfull persons, and others, for
a Plantation in the <HI>New-found-land:</HI> my
often trauels to that Countrey, and many wrongs
which I receiued there, gaue me cause to take some no|tice,
and obserue the vnfitnesse of the place where the
said Plantation was first begun; as also how in seuerall
yeeres, Pirates, and erring Subiects were there entertai|ned;
which as I conceiued, was a dishonour to his
Maiesty, an abuse to the Vndertakers of that worthy
purpose; as also a generall wrong to all his Maiesties
subiects which aduenture thither. And likewise often
seeing great abuses committed there yeerely by the tra|ders
thither, I was thereby imboldened to compile my
former discouery of that Countrey as now it is. The
which when I had so done, I did not trust onely to my
owne iudgement, that the same was fit to be presented
vnto his Maiesty, vntill I had the approbation of some
iudiciall Lords, and other right worshipfull Knights,
that it was a businesse of worth to bee so presented, as it
<PB N="2" REF="6">
hath been. Since which time, I have not seene any rea|son
to the contrary in my selfe, neither haue I hitherto
found any iudiciall contradiction in others, but that to
inhabite and plant seuerall Colonies of his Maiesties
subiects in that Countrey, will be both honourable and
profitable to them all in generall. Whereunto seeing
your Honor is led by your own proper vertues and ge|nerosity:
as also the right Honorable Sir <HI>George Caluert</HI>
Knight (one of the principall Secretaries to his Maie|sty)
and diuers others right worshipfull Knights and
Esquires in some other seuerall parts there, whereby it
appears that your Honours, nor any of the other Vn|dertakers
are dis-heartened therein, by reason the
same hath not been as yet so orderly proceeded on as
yee both intend. For there is no doubt, but that other
mens errours will make you and yours the more curi|ous
in the conduction thereof; like expert Pilots, who
by the discouery of rockes and shelues, know how to a|uoyd
them, and by sight of other mens shipwracks,
perfectly know how to preuent their owne. Of which
Countrey, considering his Maiesty, out of his Princely
care and vnderstanding, hath taken such deepe and
singular notice; by which both yee, and diuers others
are, as also partly by my discoueries, incouraged there|unto
to make it famous vnto all posterities; And sith
Plantations as well as reformations begin by degrees:
so you haue all the pregnant reasons of the world to
rest assured; that when you have begun to settle your
directions and designes well therein, you have halfe
ended: and because the attempt and enterprize heereof
is as full of assurances, as hopes, the issue thereof will
vndoubtedly proue fortunate, and the successe glorious.
And although your iudgements &amp; reasons haue alrea|dy
<PB N="3" REF="6">
made you, not onely credulous, but confident here|of,
yet to informe and prepare the knowledge of those
who shall be willing to assist the same with you both, in
the honours and profits which will accrue thereby, I
haue aduentured to compile and divulge this ensuing
Treatise, which tends and leads that way; although I
know well, that the worke deserues a more curious pen
to make it passe currant with the iudicious Reader:
Yet my sincerity and integrity in penning it, will, I
trust, supply the defects, or at least the truth thereof;
which is indeed the only proper foundation, structure,
and ornament herein. And thus fearing, lest I should
make this my introduction ouer tedious: I will pro|ceed
and lay open the matter and reasons for the per|formance
thereof, to the sight and censure of whomsoe|uer
hath seene that Countrey, or shall be willing to as|sist
your so noble and worthy designes.</P>
<P>The two seuerall circuits of land in that Countrey,
which is so granted vnto your Lordship, &amp; your heires
in fee for euer, I haue heere plainly expressed in what a
temperate Climate it lyeth; As also in what manner the
bounds thereof extend: Likewise the commodious
lying of some good Harbours, Bayes, and Roades with|in
the same; where great store of Shipping hath long
time vsed to ride at Anchor, for making of their fish|ing
Voyages: As also partly the pleasantnesse of some
parts of the said seuerall Circuits: And what the parti|cular
charge may amount vnto, for victualing forth a
Ship of one hundred Tun burthen to that Countrey
with forty persons, prouided with all necessaries for the
fishing voyage, and for the good of the said Plantati|on:
As also what yeerely benefit may accrue vnto the
Aduenturers thereby: And withall, by Gods assistance,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
the said Plantation to be proceeded on with much fa|cility:
As also in what liberall manner you will be plea|sed
to entertaine such as shall be willing to aduenture
with you therein. The reasons which I shall deliuer,
to performe what I haue written herein, I humbly sub|mit
vnto your fauour and iudgement: the defects
and things needlesse, to your honourable censure and
pardon. So shall I not feare, any who hath seene
that Countrey, shall bee able iustly to disproue the
same.</P>
<P>The Southmost part of your Circuit in that Land,
which is now called by the name of South-Fawlkland,
lyeth neere in forty sixe degrees and a halfe of Nor|therly
latitude, beginning on the East side of that I|land,
at a certaine Harbour called Renowze: And from
thence West vnto a certaine Bay in that Iland, called
by the name of Pleasaunce: And from the foresaid har|bour
of Renowze towards the North, so farre as halfe
the way betweene another certaine Harbour there,
called Agafort, and another Harbour called Formosa:
And from thence towards the West, so far as the fore|said
Bay of Pleasaunce: And so from the said West
line towards the South, vnto the abouesaid West line,
which commeth there from the aforesaid Harbour of
Renowze: And all that which is inclusiuely within the
said Circuit.</P>
<P>From the said Harbour of Renowze, vnto the middle
way betweene the said Agafort and Formosa: it is in
breadth South and North, aboue 6. English miles:
And in length no lesse then 50. East and West.</P>
<P>Formosa is a Harbour fit for any Ship, of what bur|then
soeuer, there to ride well at Anchor, and stretch|eth
towards the West from the entrance thereof, neere
<PB N="5" REF="7">
foure miles; into which Harbour there yeerely comes
aboue 20. saile of English Ships, which haue commo|dious
places to salt and dry fish on: and also diuers
Portugall Ships; It is a Harbour that with small charge
may be well defended, so as no Pirats might come in
there, but by leaue. The Land on the North side of the
said Harbour, neere a mile in length by the Harbours
side, is fit for drying of fish, and other purposes; the
rest of the North side of the said Harbour, to the inner|most
part thereof, by the Harbours side, is something
rocky, where grow store of Firre and Spruise trees, and
other fruits. There are diuers commodious places on
the South side of the said Harbour, for salting and dry|ing
of fish, and building of houses, and many more such
conuenient places may very fitly be made there, when
people begin to inhabite that place. For the fertility of
the soyle, in diuers places betwene Formosa and Re|nowze,
I thinke it to be so good as any other Land in
all that Countrey, not onely for the pleasantnesse ef
the Climate it lyes in; but also for the goodnesse, com|modious
and leuell lying of many hundred acres in
large valleyes of good deepe earth, open and cleane,
without rocks and trees, which (questionlesse) is fit for
Wheat, Rye, Barley, and other graine: As also for Flax,
Hempe, Woad, Tobacco, and many other purposes.
How the goodnesse of that Circuit is towards the
West, from the innermost parts of these two harbours,
I cannot directly write of; more then fiue miles. The
which Land further into the Countrey, as I did often
obserue it, standing on the hils, it seemed to me, so far
as I could descry, to be very pleasant, and promise well.
There are large ponds, and a faire, broad, and long ri|uer
of deepe fresh waters vpon the hils, betweene the
<PB N="6" REF="8">
said two harbours; wherein are store of good Trowts
taken some times; And the Firre and Spruise trees
growing round about the said Ponds and Riuer fresh
and greene, Winter and Summer, with such flagrant
shewes, as no trees in such a Clymate can make a more
delightfull sight of greennesse, then those doe there;
wheron the Thrush, Thrussels, Nightingales, and other
birds doe often sit and sing so pleasantly, as if they were
neuer pincht with cold, or want of food, as such birds
are in England diuers winters.</P>
<P>Betweene the harbours of Formosa and Renowze,
it is three English miles, where wayes may be commo|diously
and easily made both for man and beast, to tra|uell
from one of the said harbours to the other: And
in my opinion (which I submit to better censures) the
fittest place within that Circuit, first to settle a Colony,
is neere vnto the harbour of Renowze, which lyeth fiue
degrees more towards the South, then the City of
London; which is is no lesse then 280. English miles:
It is a very pleasant place for that purpose, hauing seue|rall
large valleyes, which are more then three hundred
acres of good open land, deepe earth, cleane without
rockes and trees, lying vnder the hils on the Northside
of them very commodiously; which are fit to bee im|ployed
(with little labour) for corne, meddowes, pa|sture,
or whatsoeuer. And there are seuerall brookes of
fresh water which fall into the said harbour, where
comes yeerely great store of good Salmons, Salmon-peales,
Trowts, and other fish, of which kinds there are
taken great store.</P>
<P>Looke into the woods, and open lands neere vnto
Renowze; there comes often great store of Deere, and
other beasts, which are fit for profit and delight: As al|so
<PB N="7" REF="8">
in and neere thereunto infinite numbers of land-fowle,
and sea-fowle: and in Summer time, there are
abundance of fruites, as there are not better of such
kinds else-where: As also herbes, and pleasant flowers
which grow there naturally very plentifully. And di|uers
Fishermen haue carried thither seeds, and sowed
them in conuenient places; whereby they haue often
had good Cabbage, Lettice, Beetes, Carrets, and
such like, very faire and good: and for Turneps, I neuer
saw better then there, both for greatnesse, rellish, and
goodnesse; I esteeme them to be equall with any Po|tato
roots which are growing else-where. There is also
store of Spruise, Firre, Pine, and Birch trees fit for many
seruiceable purposes: And many long rushes which are
fit to couer houses withall, as the reed of wheat or rye,
wherewith diuers mens houses of good ability are co|uered:
And I am also of opinion, vpon some proofe
which I made, that there are lime stones, which is a
speciall necessary to begin a Plantation withall.</P>
<P>There come yeerely to that harbour of Renowze a|boue
twenty saile of English Ships, to fish, besides other
Nations, and there are commodious places for them all
to salt and dry fish on; and much better, in time, may
those places bee made for that purpose: And there
come also into those two harbours, Ships and Barkes
yeerely from England, and other places, to load fish,
and traine oyle, from the Fishermen: In which Ships
great store of people and prouisions; as also beasts
may be cheaply carryed thither.</P>
<P>There is a small Iland of stones and Beach, at the in|nermost
part of the harbour of Renowze, whereon a
ship of sixty tunne burden may well labour to make his
fishing voyage on; which is neere the circuit of two
<PB N="8" REF="9">
acres of ground, and it doth ebbe and flow in and out
by both sides of the said Iland, sixe foot of water vp|right
euery tide, and that tide runnes halfe a mile aboue
the said Iland, where it is very deepe water, and of a
good breadth: diuers Ships doe yeerely salt, and dry
their fish, aboue the said Iland on both sides of that Ri|uer;
although there is not water for any Boate to passe
in or out by the said Iland at euery low water, for the
space of more then an houre. And there may be com|modiously
a Bridge made on either side, in lesse then
halfe a day, fit to passe at al times, both for man &amp; beast,
from one side of the harbour to the other, vpon any oc|casion,
which is a greater commodity, for that purpose,
then any other harbour in that land, which I know that
hath the like. And from thence to the harbours mouth,
a peece of Ordnance will shoote a Bullet leuell; and so
the like aboue, to euery place where men vse to salt and
dry fish: so that if a sortification be made in that Iland,
where the fresh Riuers are so pleasant, it will not only
offend any enemie, from comming into that harbour;
but also defend such Ships and men which come yeere|ly
there a fishing, or to trade.</P>
<P>And if any enemies should at any time come thither
by land from any other place, to pretend hurt to any
man there; he cannot be at any place on either side of
the said harbour, where men vse to labour about their
fish; but that a peece of Ordnance, being placed on
that Iland, will shoote a Bullet to any such; so that by
such a fortification, euery man which comes there, may
in more security reape the benefit of their labours,
then some men haue done in that Countrey in
former times. And then there may fitly be some shel|ters
builded, whereby to succour such Beasts as are car|ried
<PB N="9" REF="9">
thither at the first, so as no deuouring beast of that
Countrey may spoile them by night: and in the
day time, they may feede in the pleasant valleys, and
vpon the hils, euen close by the said Iland, on both sides
of the said harbour, where a peece of Ordnance will
shoote a Bullet vnto them if there be cause.</P>
<P>There vsually come euery yeere in the fishing trade,
vnto the harbours of Formosa, and Renowze, aboue
eight hundred English men; which men may, to assist
one another vpon any occasion, come together in lesse
time then two houres warning, either by Sea or Land.
And there is yeerely all the Summer time, great fishing
neere vnto both the said harbours mouthes, where men
may, when they thinke good, stand vpon the land, and
call vnto the Fishermen to come into the said harbors
vnto them; which is also such a good commoditie for
securitie, as few harbours in that land haue the like.</P>
<P>In both which harbours, there is store of Lobsters,
Crabbes, Muscles, and other Shell-fish; And aboue the
foresaid Iland, it is the most commodious place for
Geese, Ducks, and other Water-fowle, winter and sum|mer,
as there is not the like in any other harbour on
the East side of that Land, to the Southward of the Bay
of Conception; whereof those men, which I left there
all the winter season, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1618. made good proofe,
and so likewise the winter before that time, and
sithence.</P>
<P>THus hauing expressed a part of the commodi|ousnesse
of the Land and Sea, neere vnto the
harbours of Formosa and Renowze; I will also
relate a part of the commodiousnesse, and great hope of
good, which may come vnto such as will be Aduentu|rers
<PB N="10" REF="10">
with your Lordship, in your other circuit of
Lands in that Countrey, now called by the name of
<HI>Trinity Land,</HI> which beginneth at the middle way of
the entrance into the Bay of Trinity in 48. degrees,
and two terces of Northerly latitude; and from thence
towards the West, vnto the inmost part of the said Tri|nity
Bay, and from the inmost part of Trinity Bay,
vnto the bounds of the Sea, on the West side of that
Land. And from the foresaid latitude, at the entrance
into the said Trinity Bay, directly from thence to|wards
the North, so farre as the Northmost part of a
certaine small Iland, lying neere the latitude of 51. de|grees,
called by the name of <HI>Penguin Iland;</HI> And from
thence to the Westermost part of the <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
in that latitude; And from that latitude on the West
side of the sayd <HI>Trinity Land,</HI> so farre to the South, as
the foresaid West line, which commeth from the in|most
part of the foresaide Trinity Bay; And all the
Lands, Harbours, Bayes, Roades, Ilands, and what|soeuer,
which is inclusiuely within the said circuit.</P>
<P>The Cape <HI>Bona vista,</HI> is the head land on the North
side of the entrance into Trinity Bay, and there is a
reasonable good harbour, where Ships doe yeerely vse
to fish, called the harbour of <HI>Bona vista,</HI> and diuers small
Ilands are neere thereunto; where yeerely breed great
aboundance of diuers sorts of Sea-fowles, of which
birds and their egges, men may take so many of them
as they list; and from the harbour of <HI>Bona vista,</HI> vnto a
little harbour called S. <HI>Catalina,</HI> on the North side of
Trinity Bay, where fisher Boates doe often harbour,
vpon some occasions; it is neere sixe leagues West
South-west in, towards the said Bay; And from thence
vnto a Roade for Ships, called <HI>English Harbour,</HI> towards
<PB N="11" REF="10">
the North-west, it is two leagues, where some yeeres
6. or 7. saile of good Ships haue made their fishing
voyages; And from thence to the North-west, halfe a
league, lieth a harbour, called <HI>Salmon Coue,</HI> wheresome
yeeres 10. saile of good Ships haue made their voyages;
And from thence to the West a league, lieth a good
Roade, called <HI>Robin Hoods Bay,</HI> where some yeeres 6.
good Ships haue made their voyages; From thence vn|to
the West, halfe a league, lye the best harbours in
that Land, called by the name of <HI>Trinity Harbour,</HI> where
some yeeres, aboue 20. saile of good Ships haue made
their fishing voyages; And from Trinity harbour to|wards
the West two leagues, lieth the harbour of <HI>Bona|uenter,</HI>
where some yeeres, 5. or 6. good Ships make
their voyages; And from thence to the West neere two
leagues, lyeth a Riuer or Inlet nauigable, fit for any ship
to saile in, stretching towards the North, which I may
well call the Riuer of <HI>Bonauenter,</HI> because it is supposed
to runne into the Bay of Flowers, which lyeth on the
North side of Trinity harbour; At the entrance of
of which Riuer, some yeeres, diuers Ships hau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> rid there
at anchor, to make their voyages; And from thence
West 4. leagues, lieth a harbour called <HI>Hartsease,</HI> where
diuers good Ships haue made their voyages; And be|tweene
the foresaid Riuer of <HI>Bonauenter,</HI> and the said
harbour of Hartsease; there is a very good harbour,
stretching towards the North, aboue 6. leagues, called
<HI>Hayleford Hauen,</HI> where Ships doe not vse to fish, by rea|son
there are no conuenient places to dry their fish on,
neere the entrance into the said harbour. And aboue
the said harbour of Hartsease, to the Westermost part
of Trinitie Bay, it is no lesse then twelue leagues: And
there is also good fishing farre into the Bay, within
<PB N="12" REF="11">
the said harbour of Hartsease, as by good proofe hath
beene often made.</P>
<P>Betweene the said harbour of Hartsease, and the
foresaid English harbour, there are many delightfull
and fruitfull Ilands, none of them aboue a mile from
the Land; And the Bay of Trinitie is in breadth, at the
neerest place, which is right ouer against the harbour
of Hartsease, aboue 5. leagues; And those that fish on
the South side of the said Bay, doe yeerely send their
Boates to the North side, for baite to take their fish
withall; because such baite is there in great aboun|dance;
And on those foresayd Ilands, there yeerely
breed innumerable store of Geese, Ducks, Gulls, and
other Sea-fowle, to which places the natiues of the
Countrey doe often come from the North, and fetch
those Fowles and their egges, as they haue beene often
seene so to doe.</P>
<P>There haue diuers yeeres been aboue sixty saile of
good Ships fishing in the foresaid Trinity harbour, and
those foresaid Bayes, Roades, and harbours, and they
haue all made as great thriuing voyages there, as any
other Ships haue made at any other place in that
Countrey; all that North side of Trinity Bay lyeth
pleasantly against the South, being neere in the latitude
of 49. degrees, by which it may be well conceiued, the
Climate of it selfe should be very pleasant, considering
that the City of London is more then three degrees to
the North, then that place, which is no lesse then 180.
English miles; and there is all such fruits in great a|bundance,
as are formerly recited in my discouery of
that Countrey, and all such sorts of fish of what kind
soeuer, so plentifull, as in any other part to the South|ward
on that Coast; and the Firre, Spruise, Pine, and
<PB N="13" REF="11">
Birch trees are there much greater, and longer, and the
Countrey fuller of woods, then it is to the South|ward;
and if some people doe once begin to inhabite
there, questionlesse, there is great hope in doing much
good, not onely in fishing, and manuring of land, but
also in sawing of boords, and squaring of Timber, fit
to be transported from thence into other Countries; as
also for making of Iron, Salt, Sope, Pitch and Tarre;
whereby good profit may be gotten; considering what
commodities in all Europe do more decay then wood,
whereof there is no likelihood (in the opinion of man)
euer to be any want thereof in that Countrey. So that
it may be well conceiued, it is a good neighbor Coun|trey
to lay hold on, seeing it may be possessed so fitly.</P>
<P>Thus according to my certaine knowledge, I haue
partly shewed how your seuerall Circuits lye in that
Countrey; and partly the great hope whereby it may
incourage diuers worthy men to become suiters vnto
your Honour, to bee Aduenturers to further the same,
when they shall also bee made acquainted with such
bountifull conditions, as you will bee pleased to grant
vnto euery such Aduenturer.</P>
<P>Which conditions, are as it hath pleased your Lord|ship
something to acquaint me withall, That any who
will aduenture 100. pounds to settle a Colony neere
vnto the foresaid harbour of Renowze, and towards the
setting forth of such shipping thither yeerely in the fi|shing
trade, as it may please you; and such as shall ad|uenture
therein to thinke good, wherby to aduance the
said Plantation, and also to defray the charge in setting
forth such shipping with good profit.</P>
<P>So that such shipping so imployed, shall carry peo|ple
yeerely, and prouisions, for all such as shall continue
<PB N="14" REF="12">
there, and such beasts, and all other necessaries as may
be thought fit, and not to hire any other Ship for that
purpose onely: And that any Aduenturer shall not
onely haue his equall part, proportionably of the bene|fit
which may bee yeerly gotten there, by the fishing;
but also such part of the benefit as may be gotten by the
labours and industry of those which shall yeerely bee
sent to remaine there, as seruants to you and the Ad|uenturers,
who are to prouide for them.</P>
<P>And also any such shall likewise haue (which ad|uentures
100. pounds to be imployed as aforesaid) the
one halfe part and preogatiue of one of the foresaid
Harbours, Bay, or Road on the Northside of Trinity
Bay, and the circuit of two thousand acres of such land
and woods as is next adioyning thereunto, in fee for e|uer
to be holden of your Lordship, by the rent of a pen|ny
by the yeere for euery such hundred acres of land
and woods, which is twenty pence by the yeere for
two thousand acres.</P>
<P>And also he shall haue in fee for euer, to him and his
assignes, a conuenient place to build a Stage, and neces|sary
roomes to salt fish on, and to build a dwelling
house, and other conuenient houses, neere vnto the har|bours
of Formosa and Renowze, with a sufficient cir|cuit
of ground to dry fish on, and for some other purpo|ses,
fit for a Ship of fouresore Tun burthen.</P>
<P>So that any such vndertaker doe within a fit time li|mited,
settle and maintaine there to inhabite eight per|sons
at least: and so many more as he shall think good;
and take the benefit of their labours to his owne par|ticular
account, which may bee worth yeerly a great
profit to any such Aduenturer, and to pay for the same
as a rent by the yere 10.s. And for default of not conti|nuing
<PB N="15" REF="12">
there yeerely, after a fit time limited, eight per|sons;
or for non payment of the foresaid rents of ten
shillings by the yeere; and the abouesaid rent of twen|ty
pence by the yeere: then any such vndertaker shall
forfeit his right, title and interest in all such land and
woods; and likewise in the said place for salting and
drying of fish (but not the benefit of such a summe as
he shall so aduenture.) And if any such aduenturer, or
any of his seruants or assignes, shall at any time finde
within your said lands there, any mines of gold, siluer,
or what metall soeuer, hee shall yeeld vnto your Lord|ship
or assignes an indifferent part thereof.</P>
<P>And whosoeuer will aduenture 200. pounds, may
not onely haue a whole Harbour, Bay, or Road to him|selfe
in fee for euer, and foure thousand acres of land,
and woods thereunto adioyning on the North side of
Trinity Bay; but also a conuenient place, and ground
to build Stages and houses, and for drying of fish fit for
a Ships fishing voyage of 160. tunne burthen, neere
vnto the harbors of Formosa and Renowze; so that any
such Vndertaker, or his assignes doe, within such a con|uenient
time as shall bee set downe in his grant, main|taine
there sixteene persons, as his seruants or tenants,
and to pay double so much rent by the yeere, as whoso|euer
aduentures but 100. pounds as aforesaid: And
likewise he shall receiue double so much of the benefit
and good, which may come by the aduenture of any
such summe, in setting forth of such shipping as are to
be imployed as aforesaid; and also the like by the la|bours
of those which shall be imployed in the intended
Plantation.</P>
<P>And whosoeuer shall aduenture lesse then 100. li.
be it 80. li. 60. li. 50. li. 30. li. or 20. li. shall haue lesse pro|portionably
<PB N="16" REF="13">
in euery respect, what hee shall haue that
aduentures 100. pounds: And whosoeuer shall aduen|ture
200. pounds or a greater sum, or but 100. pounds
or a lesse summe, should disburse the one moity or
halfe part thereof this first yeere, whereby to make pro|uisions
for the fishing voyage, and shipping to bee in
perfect readinesse in fit time.</P>
<P>And any man which shall thus aduenture 200. pounds
or a greater or lesse summe, hee should bring in the o|ther
halfe part of such a summe as he doth promise, and
subscribe to aduenture the second yeere at conuenient
time, wherby to make fit prouisions in readinesse of all
necessaries, as shall be then thought fitting for the yeere
following, and then by Gods assistance, there is great
hope of gaine to bee made, and good proceedings in
the said Plantation.</P>
<P>Some of those which will be Aduenturers in this
manner, may bee as Committees, to giue their best
opinions, what they should conceiue to be most fitting
in euery respect; whereby there may bee the more or|derly
proceedings therein, and whatsoeuer any 4, 5, 6,
or a more number of them may think fit: one, or more
of them may at conuenient times acquaint your Ho|nour
withall, whereby it may the more speedily bee put
in action, and you so little troubled withall, from your
other waighty occasions as possible may bee: And so
one of the said Committees to be as Treasurer, who
may keepe the bookes of accounts, of whatsoeuer may
be so aduentured, and likewise to bee receiued, which
will giue a good content to euery Aduenturer.</P>
<P>And as concerning the manner how Ships and men
should bee imployed in this intended Plantation, I
shall as followeth acquaint you; whereby there may be
<PB N="17" REF="13">
hired some industrious men, which are most pliable for
the fishing voyage, agreed withall in time to faile in
such shipping, and with such men some others may goe
to be as Seruants in the voyage, which may be Trades|men,
and their wiues; who will labour fitly in the fish|ing,
whiles it lasteth, and afterwards continue there to
plant.</P>
<P>It is to be vnderstood, that a Ship which vsually car|rieth
there in an ordinary fishing voyage 30. men and
boyes, and returnes yeerely with them, should not,
that is thus imployed, carry aboue 34. men, women
and some Youths of 13. or 14. yeeres of age, whose
victuall and wages, for more then three quarters of the
yeere, will be euen defrayed vpon the ordinary charge
of the fishing voyage; for any such Ship may well be
sailed thither, and home againe, with lesse then twenty
men; So that those other fourteene may be accounted
vnprofitable passengers to be carryed, and so recarryed
from thence as vsually is done.</P>
<P>And therefore it is requisite, that such as shall re|maine
there to inhabite, should bee agreed withall in
time, whereby to prepare themselues for that purpose,
and not to seeke after such in haste, for then should you
not onely haue those which are not so fit as I doe wish,
for that purpose; but also they will be much more dea|rer
(as I haue often proued what they will be) if they
be taken when they proffer their seruice.</P>
<P>And he that is either a fit house-Carpenter, Mason,
Smith, Brick-maker, Lime-burner, Turner, Tyler, Hus|bandman,
Gardener, or what trade soeuer, and will car|ry
his wife with him, should be so agreed withall at first;
so that notwithstanding their trades, they should help
to fish, and labour diligently about the same, when time
<PB N="18" REF="14">
serues for all building of houses, which is a thing will
fitly bee done at all times, very commodiously, with
little labour and lesse charge, when the fish faileth.</P>
<P>And if any Aduenturer will send thither a kinsman,
friend, or seruant, to be imployed in the said Plantati|on,
which will take paines, hee may haue a fit hire al|lowed
him by the yeere, as the Treasurer, and one, or
more of the Aduenturers may thinke fit: And any such
so imployed, may see such lands and woods allotted out
for his said Master or friend, and yeerely certifie him
from thence what fit proceedings there are in the said
Plantation.</P>
<P>And also any that shall serue their 5. yeeres industri|ously,
may not only be well paid, as hee shall be agreed
withall, but you will then also giue him 100. acres of
land and woods in the South part of that Countrey in
fee for euer to him, his heires and assignes, if he will
continue there to liue, or any other man for him;
which is to be holden of your Honour, paying at the
sealing of his Deed, 8. shillings, and euer after but a pen|ny
rent by the yeere for the said hundred acres: which
will be a good incouragement to such as will go there
to liue; and be also a fit meanes to people the Coun|trey,
with such as may be well spared from all his Maie|sties
Kingdomes. And thus in time they may finde out
diuers good commodities there, which as yet lye vn|discouered,
wherof there is great hope in some speciall
thing, which I omit to write of.</P>
<P>By this it may be partly vnderstood, what great hope
of good there may come vnto his Maiesty, and all his
Maiesties Kingdomes, by settling people to inhabite
there, seeing it is a Countrey already so well approo|ued,
to be so healthy and warme in winter as England,
<PB N="19" REF="14">
and yeelds yeerly, as the trade is now in fishing onely
aboue 150000.li. into this Kingdome, besides the great
maintenance and increase of shipping, and Mariners;
and the relieuing of many families, the which trade
onely may well, in little time, be worth double so much
yeerely to his Maiesties subiects, then now it is, besides
the great hope of gaine which is there to be gotten o|therwaies.</P>
<P>In the yeere of our Lord God 1615. being there
with a Commission directed vnto me out of his Maie|sties
high Court of Admiralty, for the reformation of
abuses, and settling of fit orders amongst such as yere|ly
trade to that Countrey, wherein I did spend much
time, and was at great charge; and then sailing from
harbour to harbour; I found the masters of English
Ships then there, willing to haue such abuses reformed,
and thereunto aboue 170. of them being impanelled
in seuerall inquests for that seruice, they did deliuer vn|to
me their seuerall presentments vnder their hands &amp;
seales, to the vse of the Kings Maiesty; which were the
first Iuries that euer were impanelled there, to the vse
of any Christian Prince; In which presentments are
contained diuers orders, which vpon my returne
from thence, I did present into the high Court of Ad|miraltie;
in which seruice I tooke notice there was
on that Coast aboue 250. saile of Ships great and small
of our Nation, with aboue 6000. Subiects in them.</P>
<P>Now if it may please his Maiestie, and that but 200.
of such Ships which yeerely saile thither a Fishing, will
leaue there in the end of the yeere, when their voyages
are made, but foure persons from euery of them, there
to inhabite with fit prouision for them, vntill the next
Summer that the said Owners Ships repaire thither
<PB N="20" REF="15">
againe, and take the benefit of their labour in that time:
then after that proportion there will be aboue 800. per|sons
fitly and cheapely left there, and maintained the
first yeere: and so euery yeere some people so left, both
men and women, will not onely bee a great ease to
this Kingdome, but also saue a great charge in carrying
thither, and in returning yeerely from thence so many
persons, and they will be also worth vnto such Aduen|turers,
as will so leaue them there, in diuers labours,
whiles the Ships are wanting from thence, a great be|nefit,
and also the greater security vnto euery such Ship
and company, that haue people so left in the Countrey,
to prouide against their comming; whereby they need
not then saile thitherward bound so timely in the yere,
and in such casuall and so desperate a manner, as yeere|ly
now they vse to doe. And if such a beneficiall course
be taken for peopling of that Land, how may there be a
fitter Plantation settled there, or elsewhere, let any man
iudge; and so fit to be vnited vnto his Maiesties other
Kingdomes, without charge, bloodshed, or vsurpation.
Any man that will thus aduenture, shall not only haue
a great quantity of land there to him &amp; his heires, with
many other priuiledges, vpon fit conditions; but also
he shall haue the yeerely benefit of such a summe as he
shall so disburse, for the setting foorth of any such ship|ping,
and the labours of such as shall be so imployed;
so that your Lordship intends not to haue the bene|fit
of any such summe, as shal be thus aduentured there|in
by any other man, but only your equall part, of such
a great summe as you pretend, by Gods assistance, to
aduenture therein likewise.</P>
<P>Then who will not be willing to imploy a part of his
estate, or to goe himselfe, or send a friend to inhabite
<PB N="21" REF="15">
that Countrey, though he haue but small meanes; or
but onely his merit to aduance his fortune, there to
tread and plant that Land, he shall so purchase by his
good indeuours, if hee haue the taste of vertue and
magnanimity? What to such a mind can be more plea|sant,
then building a foundation for his posteritie, so to
bee gotten without preiudice to any, if hee haue any
zeale in Religion? What can he doe lesse hurtfull to any,
or more agreeable to God, then to seeke to conuert the
poore Sauages (which liue in the North part of that
Country) to know their Creator and Redeemer? What
so truely suites with honour and honestie, as by infor|ming
the ignorant, and reforming things vniust, tea|ching
vertue, and gaine to our natiue mother Country,
another Kingdome, neere as spacious as Ireland to at|tend
her, where there may bee found imployments for
those that now liue idlely? Which is so far from wrong|ing
any, as to cause posterity to remember them, and
remembring them, euer to honour that remembrance
with prayse.</P>
<P>Then who would liue at home idlely, that may bee
there imployed, or thinke himselfe worthy to liue, only
to eate, drinke, and sleepe, and so die; hauing consumed
that carelesly, his friends got worthily, or by vsing
that talent miserably, which may thus maintaine ver|tue
honestly?</P>
<P>Now my hope is, that gaine will make some to affect
that, which Religion, charity, and the common good
cannot: I hauing for my owne part no other purpose
herein, but for the generall good of all his Maiesties
Subiects, and not any desire to perswade any man to
aduenture thither, but for honour and profit: neither
is my purpose by these perswasions, to draw children
<PB N="22" REF="16">
from their parents, men from their wiues, nor seruants
from their masters; but onely such as with a free con|sent
will goe, or may bee spared from such Cities and
Parishes, that will but apparell some of their father|lesse
children of foureteene or fifteene yeeres of age;
and some such yong married people, as haue but small
meanes, to set themselues forth; who by their good in|dustry,
may liue there pleasantly, and grow rich in little
time; And if any man, which shall be willing to aduen|ture
thither, desire to be further satisfied, they may reade
my discouery of that Countrey, &amp; what defect is found
in either, they shall find supplied in me to further their
good desire therin, that haue thus freely thrown myself,
with my mite, into the treasury of my Countrys good,
which I esteeme worth much more then <HI>Columbus</HI>
could certainly giue the Spaniards at his first enterprise
of any such certainties of great wealth, by his designes
in the West Indies, as since hath bin there found: and al|though
I cannot now at first promise to haue such
Mines of gold in <HI>New-found-land,</HI> yet let vs in that Plan|tation
something imitate our neere neighbors the Hol|landers,
whose wealth and strength gotten in few yeeres
only by fishing, are good testimonies, wherby they haue
in little time gotten their wealth &amp; strength; and if the
Plantation at <HI>New-found-land,</HI> be orderly proceeded on,
the trades thither, &amp; at other of his Maiesties Westerne
Plantations, would questionlesse in time afford yeerly a
greater quantity of gold and siluer into all his Maiesties
Kingdomes, then all the Mines of the West Indies doe
now yeerly yeeld to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and with lesse ha|zard,
&amp; more certainty &amp; felicity. And thus I descend to
the charge of victualling forth a Ship of 100. Tun, with
40. persons, to bee imployed for the more orderly pro|ceeding
in the said Plantation.</P>

plant; of which number, if but ten persons remaine
there, they may wel haue reserued for the~ of the former
victuals &amp; prouisions, these particulars following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>Fiue hundred waight of the Bisket bread, fiue
hogs-heads of beere, or sider, half a hogs-head of beefe,
foure whole sides of dry bacon, foure bushels of pease,
halfe a firkin of butter, halfe a hundred waight of

and the iron workes appertaining to them, in perfect
readinesse there, from yeere to yeere; and many of the
other small necessaries, when the fishing voyage is
made, as pikes, nayles, and such like, which may serue
to helpe build houses, cleanse land, and such like serui|ces
fitly for the Inhabitants to labour withal in the win|ter
time, whiles the Ships are wanting from them.</P>
<P>Now to make an estimate what fish all the 40. per|sons
fit for such a voyage, may well take, and keepe eight
<PB N="28" REF="19">
fishing boats all the Summer time there at Sea, with
three good Fishermen in euery of the said boats; and so
many men doe vsually kill aboue twenty fiue thousand
fish for euery boat, which may amount vnto two hun|dred
thousand, sixe score fishes to euery hundred: and
diuers Ships being so well prouided, haue yeerly taken
there aboue thirty fiue thousand, for euery boat: so as
they not onely load their Ship, but also sell great quan|tities,
besides their loadings yeerly to Merchants; and
if such Ships which are so well manned for that pur|pose,
cannot make sale of such fish as they take ouer and
aboue their loading; then they giue ouer taking of any
more in diuers yeeres, when there is great abundance
easily to be taken, because there are no fit houses to lay
vp the same in safety for another yeere.</P>
<P>Now to make an estimation but of twenty fiue thou|sand
of fish, for euery of the eight boats, it will amount
vnto two hundred thousand; which may bee a fit quan|tity
to fill and load a Ship of an hundred Tun burthen,
if the fish be not very small; if it be large, a Ship of that
burthen will not load so much, besides the water, wood;
victuall, and other prouisions, fit for so many men as
shal saile in the said Ship from thence, to make sale and
imployments of the said fish, which, as I conceiue, will
be a fit course so to doe, and thereby great charge, and
some aduenture will be saued in carrying the same di|rectly
to a market, in regard what it would bee, if it
should be returned home into England, and then after|wards
relade the same againe and send it to a market.</P>
<P>Wherein my opinion is, that the said Ship, hauing
her voyage at <HI>New-found-land,</HI> should saile from thence
directly to <HI>Marseiles</HI> or <HI>Talloon,</HI> which places lying with|in
the Straits of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> in the French Kings domini|ons,
<PB N="29" REF="19">
where the customes vpon Fish are but little, and
the Kentall lesse then ninety English pounds waight;
and the price of such Fish there I haue not knowne, to
be sold for lesse at any time, then twelue shillings of
currant English payment for euery Kentall, and com|monly
a farre greater price; and there speedy sales are
vsually made of such Fish, and good returnes had: and
if any man will returne his money from thence, he may
haue sure bills of exchange, for payment thereof here
in London, vpon sight of any such bills.</P>
<P>The foresaid two hundred thousand of Fish, loa|ding
the said Ship, it wil then make at Marseiles aboue
two and twenty hundred Kentalls of that waight;
which being sold but at twelue shillings the Kentall,
amounts to thirteene hundred and twenty pound ster|ling,
and is&mdash;1320. pounds.</P>
<P>A Ship of that burthen to serue the voyage, being
hired by the moneth, when she is there vnloaded, may
be then there paid for her hire, and so discharged; or
being hired for a longer time, may returne from thence
vnto some other place in Spaine, to be reloaded home
with some Marchandize, which may bee well perfor|med,
&amp; the said Ship returne in fit time to saile againe
vnto <HI>New-found-land</HI> the yeere following, with lesse
charge then the first yeere; and then greater hope of
benefit it wil be to the Aduenturers then the first yeere,
when people are there before-hand, and all things in
fit readinesse against their comming.</P>
<P>There may well bee of the foresaid two hundred
thousand of Fish, twelue Tun of traine Oyle, or a grea|ter
quantity, the which being sold and deliuered in
<HI>New-found-land</HI> at ten pounds the Tun, as commonly
it is the price there, it will amount to the summe of six
<PB N="30" REF="20">
score pounds, and is&mdash;120. pounds.</P>
<P>And also there may bee well made ouer and aboue
the foresaid quantity of two hundred thousand dry fish,
ten thousand of large greene fish; which being solde
in <HI>New-found-land,</HI> but at fiue pounds the thousand, it
will amount to the summe of fifty pounds; I say, 050. l.
which greene fish being brought into England, it may
yeeld aboue tenne pounds the thousand; and the
twelue Tunne of traine Oyle, being likewise brought
home, is vsually solde at some places in this King|dome,
for aboue eighteene pounds the Tunne, and
sometimes at twenty; which ouer-prices of the said
Oyle and greene fish, I doe here omit to sum the same,
what it may be more.</P>
<P>Now if the foresaid two hundred thousand of Fish
may be solde at Marseiles, at sixteene shillings the
Kentall, as often such Fish is, and much dearer; the
two thousand two hundred Kentals, will then amount
to the summe of seuenteene hundred and threescore
pounds.&mdash;1760. pounds.</P>
<P>And it is very likely that the foresaid eight fishing
boates being well manned, and stay continually fishing
in the Country, vntill the 15. day of October, as they
may wel, they may then take aboue thirty fiue thousand
of Fish for euery boat, as diuers yeeres many men haue
done: which will then amount to fourescore thousand
more then the former two hundred thousand.</P>
<P>The which fourescore thousand so gotten ouer and
aboue the Ships loading, may be otherwise disposed
of at <HI>New-found-land;</HI> be it more or lesse, it may yeeld
there foure pounds the thousand, allowing to that
price all the traine Oyle and greene Fish which may
come thereof: so that there may be well gotten ouer
<PB N="31" REF="20">
and aboue the Ships loading, fourescore thousand of
Fish, and much more; the which at foure pounds the
thousand, will amount to the summe of-0320.li.-s.-d.</P>
<P>Adding thereunto the former sum of-1320.-0.-0.-0.</P>
<P>And also for the aforesaid Oyle.&mdash;-0120.-0.-0.-0.</P>
<P>And also for the 10000. greene Fish.-0050.-0.-0-0.</P>
<P>And also for the ouer-price at Marseiles, being
solde at sixteene shillings the Kentall, it will bee some
&mdash;0440.-0.-0.-0.</P>
<P>Totall Summe&mdash;2250.-0.-0.-0.</P>
<P>OF which summe, be it more or lesse, whatso|euer
is gotten in the voyage; if victuals, Salt,
and the other former prouisions, be prouided
at reasonable cheape prices: Then the Master and
Company haue a third part thereof, allowing some
smal matter from the same, towards the victualing; and
there is another third part likewise to be allowed, to|wards
the Ships trauell and charge, deducting some|thing
likewise thereof towards the Master of the Ship,
for taking the charge, and for some other of the better
sort of men, which they vsually haue ouer and aboue
their shares of the former third: and the other third
remaines vnto the Victualers forth of the Ship.</P>
<P>So that the voyage amounting as aforesaid, to the
summe of two thousand, two hundred &amp; fifty pounds:
A third will bee the summe of seuen hundred and fifty
pounds for the victualling part; from which deducting
the former charge of 420.li.&mdash;01.s.&mdash;04.d. which is
to be for the victualling forth of a Ship with forty per|sons;
there may remaine to the Aduenturers for the
bearing the Aduenture, and all Charges discharged,
the summe of&mdash;331.li.&mdash;11.s. And in some yeeres,
<PB N="32" REF="21">
when salt, bread and beere is deare bought; the victu|alling
part is allowed the one moity or halfe part of
what is gotten in the voyage, and the Company and
Ship the other halfe part.</P>
<P>Now omitting to write of any greater price, which
may be gotten vpon the sales of the two hundred thou|sand
of Fish at Marseiles, or the benefit which may be
made vpon the returnes of the money for the same
from thence, or what may be gotten by the imploy|ments
of the foresaid summe, at the place where the
sales are made:</P>
<P>Likewise what may be more gotten vpon the traine
Oyle and greene Fish, if it be not sold in <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
but brought home, and sold heere at the best
hand:</P>
<P>And if a Ship be hired by the moneth to performe
this voyage, which may be ended in lesse then nine
moneths, the Ship to be free at Marseiles, when the
Fish is vnloaden there; and being hired at forty pound
a moneth or much cheaper; it may then be esteemed
what may be gotten by hiring of a Ship in that man|ner,
if the Fish and traine Oyle amount vnto the prices,
as it is valued: if it yeeld more, then the greater be|nefit
will come by hiring of a Ship; if lesse, after the
rate accordingly.</P>
<P>And if Pans be prouided for the making of Salt in
the <HI>New-found-land,</HI> as fitly and cheapely it may be,
then will the charge in setting forth of any Ship by the
Aduenturers, be much lesse, and the benefit much the
greater.</P>
<P>Now whereas there are but twenty foure men of the
forty nominated to fish; the other are to labour the
Fish at land, (of which sixteene) seuen are to be skilfull
<PB N="33" REF="21">
headders, and splitters of fish; two boyes to lay the fish
on a table, and three to salt the fish, which labour, three
women may fitly doe; three men may fetch a-land salt,
and tend to wash fish, and dry the same; which may be
two house Carpenters and a Mason, the other may bee
a woman, which makes vp sixteene to bee a-land,
who may be fit to prouide meate, and to wash, and dry
fish so well as men, and other labours also.</P>
<P>And those persons which remaine there, should be
hired by the yeere, whose yeerely wages will not bee
aboue 8. or 9. pounds a couple one with the other, and
apparell themselues; which apparell the aduenturers
are to prouide; and those which are thus hired, to allow
for the same againe out of their yeerely wages. The
which yeerely wages, for euery couple of those which
should continue there, will bee borne yeerely on
that part of the fish and oyle, which may come to the
Companies part, as aforesaid, if the businesse be order|ly
carried; So that the victuals of those persons which
should remaine there to plant, from the 20. day of
March, vnto the 20. day of Nouember; and their whole
yeeres pay should euery yeere be, as it were charged and
raised out of the Companies third part, from yeere to
yere; Neither should the aduenturers be any other way
charged for them, but onely for some fit quantitie of
Meale, Mault, Beefe, Porke, Butter, Cheese, <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI>
and some other fit things to serue them in winter, vn|till
the Ships returne to them againe, in the beginning
of euery Summer; and then they are to be againe as of
the Ships company.</P>
<P>In which time of winter, their labours vpon the
land, in building of houses, sawing of boords, squaring
of timber, manuring of land, and doing other seruices,
<PB N="34" REF="22">
may well defray the said charge, with good benefit
ouer and aboue the same.</P>
<P>And then the second yeere, euery of those persons,
which so shall remaine there, may haue their equall
shares with the Fishermen, which may well pay their
wages and charge that the Aduenturers should bee at
for them.</P>
<P>This is the order and course, which I haue long time
had an opinion, that an orderly and beneficiall Planta|tion
in the <HI>New-found-land,</HI> is to be at first proceeded
on, and not by carriage of beasts thither to till the land,
before such time as prouisions bee made for them to
liue in winter, which will require some time to fit Med|dowes
at first for hay, and fit houses for them.</P>
<P>A Ship of a hundred Tun burthen, being thus im|ployed,
may also well carry in her the first yeere for in|crease,
Hogs, Goates, and Poultry, which will not bee
chargeable, nor pester much roome in the Ship, and
they will prooue and increase exceeding well there, as I
haue often prooued, and be at very little or no charge
in keeping of them there; And after the first yeere, the
said Ship sailing thither with a lesse number of people,
prouision being made there in readinesse, she may carry
in her great store of Beasts and prouision for them.</P>
<P>And for the better proceeding in this Plantation, it
will bee good for the Aduenturers to hire two small
Barks, neere the burthen of 30. Tun apiece by the mo|neth,
to bee victualled and manned by them, which
should serue as in a fishing voyage, with ten persons in
each Barke, and they should haue in euery of them, all
prouisions fit to keepe two Fisher boates at Sea, either
of them all the summer, and then those Barks may also
well carry some beasts for increase; and they should de|part
<PB N="35" REF="22">
hence before the Ship of a hundred Tun burden,
for some speciall seruices, and then the Ship of a hun|dred
Tun, with 40. persons, neede not depart out of
England, before towards the end of March, which
Barks being there timely in the yeere, may be in many
respects worth much more, for the good of the fishing
voyage, and the said Plantation, then their hire by the
moneth will amount vnto, as for many reasons which I
can deliuer.</P>
<P>And then taking that course, there may be some sales
made before-hand of a hundred thousand of fish or a
greater quantity to some Merchants, to be deliuered in
<HI>New-found-land,</HI> and to receiue mony for the same here
in London, vpon Bills of Exchange; All which, by Gods
assistance, may be well performed, and the bigger Ship
also, well loden, to saile from thence to some good mar|ket,
to make sales of the same.</P>
<P>And then one of those Barks may loade all such
traine oyle as may be gotten in the voyage, and returne
with the same, where it may be thought best to make
sale thereof; And the other Barke may then load all such
greene fish as may be made, and returne home to Eng|land
or elsewhere to dispose thereof.</P>
<P>Thus it may be all well performed, and store of fish
left for the prouision of those which are to stay in the
Countrey to inhabite: and also for the hogs and water|fowle
to feed on in winter when there is cause.</P>
<P>Now whether it may be best to buy a Ship of 100.
Tun burden, or bigger, to serue for the said voyage, or
to hire such a one by the moneth, for that purpose; I
leaue it to the consideration of your Lordship, and the
other Aduenturers.</P>

THus I haue shewed in what a temperate cli|mate
your seuerall circuits of land doe lie in
that Countrey, as also how the bounds thereof
extend; and also partly what good Harbours, Bayes,
and Roads for shipping to ride safe at Anchor, are with|in
the same; as also such conditions as you will be plea|sed
to grant vnto any that will bee an Aduenturer
with you therein; and also partly the great hope, both
of honour and profit to all those that shall bee wil|ling
to bee Aduenturers with you, to further the
same.</P>
<P>Whereby it may be well vnderstood, that by an or|derly
settling of the said Plantation, it will be for the
generall good of all his Maiesties Subiects, and not
hurtfull to any; And it will be also a most speciall bene|fit,
and good for all those which yeerely trade there in
fishing, what now it is, though they settle no people
there to plant, whereby to keepe and maintaine their
certaine places, there to salt and dry their fish on: by
reason that those vvhich shall inhabite there, vvill vpon
request, and some small gratuity, preserue their fishing
Boates yeerely from spoiling, so as they may haue them
and their Stages, and all commodious and necessary
roomes in such perfect readinesse, yeerely against their
comming thither, which may vndoubtedly bee worth
vnto them in their fishing voyages, many thousands of
pounds more yeerely then now it is, as it cannot be de|nied
by any that knowes the manner and order of these
<HI>New-found-land</HI> voyages.</P>
<P>Now hauing thus plainly expressed with what faci|lity
this Plantation may bee orderly proceeded on; I
will also make knowne my opinion and certaine know|ledge,
how some such Aduenturers to that Countrey,
<PB N="37" REF="23">
of his Maiesties subiects may yeerely make much grea|ter
benefit of trade, in returning from thence, then any
man that I haue euer heard of, or knowne, which hath
as yet put in practice, leauing it to those that will make
triall thereof.</P>
<P>IT is well knowne, that from the foresaid harbour of
Renowze, vnto a place called the Banke, which lyeth
East from thence towards England, neer 25. leagues
in the like altitude as the said harbour of Renowze is,
which Banke is a sand, in most places neere twelue
leagues broad; and in length Northeast, and South|west,
aboue 100. leagues; on which Banke, there is no
lesse then 20. fadome of water at any place: &amp; there fish
aboue 100. saile of French Ships, Winter and Summer,
some of them making two voyages there in a yeere, and
another voyage to some other place also in the same
yeere.</P>
<P>I haue often (sailing towards the <HI>New-found-land</HI>)
met with some French Ships, comming from thence,
deepe loden with fish, in the first of Aprill, who haue
taken the same there, in Ianuary, February, and March,
which are the sharpest moneths in the yeere for stormes
and cruell weather.</P>
<P>To which Banke our Nation may doe great good in
fishing, such as will saile from the <HI>New-found-land</HI> in the
later part of the Summer, when the fish begins to draw
from that coast, as commonly it doth when the Winter
comes on; I meane, such shipping as are to be imploy|ed
by whomsoeuer may vndertake to plant there, and
likewise any other Ships that saile thither a fishing, as
now they vse to doe, who hauing disposed away such
fish and traine oyle as they take there in the Summer
<PB N="38" REF="24">
time vnto Merchants, as vsually euery yeere some haue
done, they may then (salt being made there) as it may
be fitly and cheaply, take in thereof a fit quantity, and
fresh-water, wood, fresh fowles great store, and other
victuall, and likewise a sufficient quantity of Herrings,
Mackerell, Capeling, and Lawnce, to bait their hookes
withall for taking of fish; because such bait the French|men
are not able to haue, that saile purposely to fish at
the said Banke, but are constrained to bait their hookes
with a part of the same Codfish they take there, where|with
they load their Ships.</P>
<P>The which fish so taken there, are larger, thick|er,
and sweeter, then the same kind of fishes that are
taken on the coast of <HI>New-found-land.</HI> Whereby it may
be well vnderstood to be more necessary, for such as wil
saile there to fish, to carry such kinde of bait as afore|said,
with them, and then they shall more speedily load
their Ships then the Frenchmen doe, who haue there
no such bait to take fish withall, neither any other fresh
victuall of flesh kinde, wood, or fresh water to dresse
their meate withall, but onely such as they carry with
them from France.</P>
<P>Whereby it may be well conceiued, that the fishing
which the Frenchmen haue there, is a very profitable
trade; seeing they not onely saile thither in the hardest
time of Winter, which is aboue 650. leagues distance
from the neerest part of France; and in all which time
to liue vpon the Sea in a cold place, with but little
wood, wherewith to make sometimes a good fire to
dresse their meate, and to sit by to warme themselues.</P>
<P>All which hardnesse of liuing so on the said Banke,
the gaine which they make by the said fishing trade,
doth make them delight therein: whereby it may be
<PB N="39" REF="24">
well vnderstood, to be a farre better trade for our Na|tion:
such as fish the Summer time at <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
and do prouide for that purpose, they may there reload
their Ships againe with good fish, in twenty dayes,
comming thither, so well prouided as aforesaid: and
so they may then at times sit by a good fire, when they
haue laboured hard all day; whereby they will be the
better able to take more fish in a day, then so many
Frenchmen shall be able to take in two.</P>
<P>And thus may any performe the said voyage home|ward
bound in fit order, &amp; be at no charge about trim|ming
of any Ship, which shall serue in such a voyage,
but onely as is vsed euery yeere for the <HI>New-found-land</HI>
voyage onely, and with a small addition of bread and
beere to be allowed more thereunto.</P>
<P>Neither neede the Masters and Saylers of any Ships
that will vndertake the said voyage, prepare themselues
with any other apparrell or necessary prouisions, then
they yeerely vse to doe for the <HI>New-found-land</HI> voyage
onely.</P>
<P>Which voyage, I am of opinion, diuers men will
gladly vndertake, when those Plantations, now lately
intended, are orderly settled; which is likely to proue
very profitable, for any that will prepare themselues
for that purpose, seeing it will be vnto such, as a double
voyage, and all vnder one charge.</P>
<P>And whosoeuer will so imploy Ships, they may saile
with their loading so gotten there, vnto Fraunce, Por|tugall,
or Spaine, where that kinde of fish doth vsually
sell at a great price; and returne loaden from thence
(by Gods assistance) yeerely against Christmasse, with
some Salt, Oyle, Wine, Fruit, and some Royalls of
Plate; and so make foure voyages in three quarters of
<PB N="40" REF="25">
a yeere, and all vnder one setting forth.</P>
<P>And then such may afterwards spend the time at
their homes, vntill it be towards Aprill in euery yeere,
which is timely enough to set forth againe in the said
voyages.</P>
<P>And if any Ship so imployed, doe returne from
thence directly home to England, that kinde of fish
will sell so well here, and is so good as any powdered
Cod which is taken in the North Seas, or vpon the
coast of England or Ireland.</P>
<P>Thus briefely and plainely, but not curiously, I haue
runne thorow my intended taske of my second mo|tiues
and reasons, which leades to the aduancement of
his Maiesties most hopefull Plantation in the <HI>New-found-land;</HI>
not that my resolution is any way to insi|nuate
with the capacity, either of the highest, or mea|ner
sort of people, thereby to inuite them to the setting
forth of this great and happy enterprize, further then
the sollidity of the truth, and well grounded probabili|ties,
shall direct and leade them; but rather to informe
their iudgements of the naturall state, condition, be|nefits,
and trade to that Countrey, which promiseth
so many hopes; and these hopes so much assurance of
a most flourishing and succesfull issue, that indeede, to
vse but few words for all, wee neede onely desire to
know the <HI>New-found-land,</HI> and to loue it as wee
should.</P>
<P>But as the smallest terrestriall action cannot possibly
prosper, without Gods diuine assistance, to perfect and
finish it: so this great worke, so pious and noble of it
selfe, as tending to the propagation of so many Chri|stian
soules to God, will (by his eternall prouidence
and great mercy) be both furthered and blessed in the
<PB N="41" REF="25">
attempt, preseruation, and establishing thereof.</P>
<P>As for my selfe, who out of mine owne experience,
and the integrity of my thoughts, am confident, that
the end will crowne the beginning of this most hope|full
Plantation, I shall euer, like a true hearted English|man,
and his Maiesties humble and faithfull Subiect,
religiously desire, and wish to see it in a faire forward|nesse
and good proceeding: howsoeuer, as vertue is
subiect and incident to be crossed, and maligned by
the followers of vice; and that we sometimes see many
excellent and noble proiects strangled or made abor|tiue
in their birthes: Euen so this great worke may
(perhaps) be either blasted by nipping whirle-windes
at home, or decay and die, through some fatall and
disasterous misfortune, in the miscarrying or vnskilful|nesse
of such as may seeke, and be imployed in the ma|naging
and conduction thereof, as many worthy at|tempts
haue beene, by taking vnfit agents and procee|dings.</P>
<P>And if it should so happen (which God defend) ei|ther
in your Lordships good purpose therein, or the
right Honourable Master Secretary <HI>Caluerts:</HI> who ha|uing
already (partly by my information) sent some
people there to plant; and that shortly yee both intend
to send greater numbers thither to your seuerall Co|lonies:</P>
<P>That then, for the better proceeding in both your
good resolutions, it ca~not be gain-said but that it may
doe well, that those people which are to be sent thither
at first, are to be directed by such as well vnderstand
how to imploy euery seuerall person there at all times;
not onely in the fishing trade, when the times serue;
which (indeede) is the onely instrument and sinew that
<PB N="42" REF="26">
is best like at first to giue comfort, and hold life vnto
this so pious worke: For euen as it is a speciall good
rule, and most fit, in time of Haruest, to be industrious
and carefull to reape and gather the sheaues into some
places of safety: So is it also requisite, that a prouident
course be taken with all those which are to be imployed
to that Countrey, that they should be either skilfull in
such things as shall be fitting, when time serues, or di|rected
by those which are well experienced therein;
Because that in the Summer time, when those great
Shoales of the Cod-fish draw to that coast to spawne,
and take his fill on multitudes of smaller fishes, which
they follow there close to the cliffes and sands; com|monly
thirty dayes together, before they hale off from
the shore againe, and in such manner, there come
three seuerall Shoales of the Cod-fishes in the Summer
time: The one of them followes on the Herrings: the
other followes the Capling, which is a fish like the
Smelt: And the third followes the Squid, which is a
fish something like the Cuddell.</P>
<P>Now at those times there vsually goe many Boates
forth a fishing from that coast, onely with three men in
each Boat; And those three being fit Fishermen, will
daily take at those times aboue 1200. of those Cod-fishes,
six score to the hundred, and euery of those fishes
with the Oyle which comes of them, being valued but
at a penny for euery such fish, which is a cheape rate, it
wil amount to be worth six pound starling, being split|ted,
salted, and dried, as the same ought to be; where|in
there is good industry, experience, and much iudge|ment
to be vsed; otherwise there is but little hope that
such fish can be taken and fitly preserued, whereby to
defray the charge, and bring profit withall to both
<PB N="43" REF="26">
your Honours, and all other Aduenturers with you, as I
much desire that yee and they all may haue.</P>
<P>By this it may be well vnderstood, it is good angling
with the hooke and line there, when a single man may
take in that imployment aboue forty shillings worth of
fish a day: for I haue often seene there, that those who
are most industrious in taking and well handling of
such fish, haue certainely been most willing, fittest and
readiest to build, and doe any other seruice there, at
such times whilest the fish failes; when some others
that are vnskilfull in the one, will stand and talke with
their hands in their Gloues or Pockets, and doe but
little to any purpose in the other; like those that come
on the Stage to act their part in a Comedy, but per|forme
it not sufficiently: so that they are not onely
scoffed and hist at; but also those which are at the
charge, and chiefe Actors thereof, receiue some dis|grace
and wrong thereby: for I haue often knowne
there some proper men, which haue not beene well ac|quainted
with those affaires; yet haue had some other
good parts in them, and would speake well when they
haue come from thence, yet neuer performed any thing
there worthy of great commendations.</P>
<P>THus I haue endeuoured with much trauaile,
great expence, and losse of time, to make
it plainely appeare, that it will be pleasing,
honourable, and beneficiall vnto all those that shall be
willing to aduance the said Plantation; which, praised
be God, is now partly by my seuerall relations, come
vnto a faire forwardnes.</P>
<P>And although I haue but little hope to receiue any
benefit by the said Plantation to my selfe; or for my
<PB N="44" REF="27">
endeuours, great expence, and losse of time herein: yet
by Gods blessed assistance, I shall, among many other
great losses and discontents which I haue had, as it is
well knowne, beare this one content to my graue, that
I haue euer beene a true louing Subiect to my Prince
and Countrey; and in the sollicitation by these my two
seuerall Treatises, and otherwise, I haue dealt truly
with his Maiesty, carefully and vprightly with either
of your Honours, and sincerely with all those which
shall be willing to assist either of your good purposes
therein.</P>
<P>Now if any which shall not be willing, or is not able
to performe a part, for the perfecting of this great and
most hopefull worke, should dislike that I haue thus
laid open a gap into those grounds, which some doe
seeme to challenge, and appropriate, as it were vnto
themselues, and so would not haue all others of his
Maiesties Subiects made acquainted with the trade
and benefit, which is there like to be obtained:</P>
<P>Such (as I conceiue) may be compared to be some|thing
like vnto <HI>Esops</HI> dog, which could eate no Hay,
neither would hee suffer the hungry Asse to feede
thereon.</P>
<P>Yet my hope is, that such may well vnderstand by
what I haue written, that my true desire is, to shew vn|to
any of them, that by the said Plantation and trading
to that Countrey, being so well followed, as it may or|derly
be, that all his Maiesties Kingdomes, which now
are beholding vnto other Countreys for some necessa|rie
commodities, might not only be furnished with the
like from thence, but also in taking of such fish, as those
Seas do yeeld at an easier rate then now we vse to haue
them: wherby we may serue <HI>France, Spain, Portugall, Italy,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="27">
and other places, much cheaper with that sort of fish,
then any of these other nations shall be able to fetch
the same from thence, and thereby haue and retaine all
the trade of that Countrey, vnto his Maiesties Subiects
hands onely.</P>
<P>For whereas there saile yeerely to that Countrey a|boue
250. saile of Ships from England only, with aboue
5000. English men in them; by whose labours, there is
yeerely gotten into this Kingdome, aboue the sum of
150000. li. and also thereby many families set on worke
and relieued: then it may bee well vnderstood, what a
great benefit and strength it will be, when there shall
faile thither 500. saile of Ships, &amp; aboue 10000. seruice|able
Subiects in them, which will be able to gaine, with
the helpe of such numbers of other men, women, and
children, as may yeerely bee so commodiously car|ried
thither few yeeres, when the Subiects are made
acquainted with such an orderly course, as both your
Honours haue already taken for the aduancement of
the said Plantation.</P>
<P>Whereby there may be thus yeerely gotten, not
onely much wealth, but also great strength against such
time, as any other Prince should breake league with his
Maiestie, that then to haue in such readines 500. saile of
his Subiects Ships, so ready to come from thence, with
more then 10000. seruiceable Sea-men in them, in lesse
time then 15. dayes warning, if the wind serue, which
is so short a time, as Saylers may be prest in some part
of this Kingdome, and be able to come from thence
vnto his Maiesties Nauy Royall at Chattam, vpon any
occasion of seruice.</P>
<P>The like strength by Sea, there is not any other
Prince in the world able to call home vnto him in so
<PB N="46" REF="28">
short a time of his owne subiects, from any one place of
trading, if he haue neuer so great occasion.</P>
<P>Thus, God blessing the said Trade and Plantation,
it will be, not onely a great augmentation to his Maie|stie
in his reuenues and customes, but also a generall
good vnto all his Highnesse Kingdomes and Subiects,
both in inriching of aduenturers in particular, and also
in strengthening the wall of defence, which God hath
set about our natiue nest, <HI>Great Brittaine,</HI> namely, Na|uigation,
which must needes be much cherished and
furnished by this Seminary of Fishers, imployed in
such Colonies, and out of that shoale, will be alwayes
in readinesse &amp; of ability to be translated higher, from
fishing vessels, into fighting Ships Royall; and so are
alwayes vsefull for peace or warre, merchandize or de|fence,
as the occasions of our estate and welfare shall re|quire.</P>
<CLOSER>And so I leaue the successe thereof to the good
pleasure of God: to whom be all the glory.
