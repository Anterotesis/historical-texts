<HEAD>A
LETTER
Writ from
ROME,
To one in Holland, concerning the
QUIETISTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_YOur desire of being informed
particularly by me, of the state
of <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI>
and chiefly here at <HI>Rome,</HI> has
quickned my curiosity, and has
set an edge upon a humour that is of it self
Inquisitive enough: and tho I am not so
much in lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> with writing, as to delight in
transmitting you long <HI>Letters,</HI> yet I find
I have matter at present for a very long one;
chiefly in that which relates to the <HI>Quietists:</HI>
for you observe right, that the short hints
that <HI>Dr. Burnet</HI> gave of their matters in his
<HI>Letters,</HI> did rather increase the curiosity of
<PB N="2" REF="10">
the <HI>English,</HI> than satisfy it. He told as much as
was generally known in <HI>Rome</HI> at that time,
concerning them; but as a longer stay might
have discovered more particulars to him, so
there have fallen out since that time such
new and surprising accidents, that there is
not more hearkning after new <HI>Evidence</HI> in
<HI>England,</HI> upon the breaking out of <HI>Plots,</HI>
than there was at <HI>Rome</HI> upon the Impri|sonment
of so great a number of persons in
<HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> last; the number alone
of 200 <HI>persons,</HI> was enough to raise a great
curiosity; but this was much encreased by
the quality of the persons that were clapt
up, who were both for Rank, for Learning,
and for Piety, the most esteemed of any in
<HI>Rome.</HI> So I was pusht on by my own Incli|nations,
as well as by your Entreaties,
to take all the pains that was possible for me,
to be well Informed of this matter. The
particular Application with which I had read
some of the Books of Devotion writ in this
method, and the pleasure, and, I hope, pro|fit,
that I had found in it, made me still
the more earnest to know this matter to the
bottom. It is true, it was hard to find it out:
for those who have been in <HI>Rome,</HI> know with
how much caution all people there talk of
matters that are before the <HI>Inquisition:</HI> those
are like the Secrets of state elsewhere:
of which a man cannot talk much without
<PB N="3" REF="10">
incurring some Inconvenience; and there is
no Inconvenience that is more terrible at
<HI>Rome,</HI> than the falling into the hands of the
<HI>Inquisitors:</HI> for besides the Danger that a
man runs, if the suspitions are well founded,
the least ill effect that this must have, is the
cutting off all a mans hopes of Preferment;
for what a Suspition of <HI>High Treason</HI> is else|where,
the Suspition of <HI>Heresy</HI> is at <HI>Rome;</HI>
and where there are many Pretenders, and
there is so much to be expected, you may
imagine that Hope and Fear working at the
same time so powerfully, it must be very hard
to ingage such persons as probably know the
secret of things, to trust themselves upon so
tender a point, to strangers. The truth is,
<HI>Learning</HI> is so low in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the Opinion
that they have of the Learning of <HI>Strangers,</HI>
chiefly of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> is so high, that they do
not willingly enter either on Subjects of <HI>Lear|ning</HI>
or of <HI>Religion</HI> with them; and on the
other hand a <HI>Stranger</HI> and a <HI>Heretick,</HI> who is
considered as a <HI>Spye,</HI> or a fair Enemy at best,
will not find it convenient to thrust on
such subjects of conversation, as are tender
and suspitious. All this is to prepare you
for a relation which you will perhaps think
defective, yet is as full a I could possibly ga|ther,
out of all the Hints and Informations
that some moneths stay at <HI>Rome</HI> procured
me.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">
The first thing that surprises a <HI>stranger</HI>
in <HI>Rome,</HI> is the very unequal mixture of
<HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>Poverty,</HI> that he sees here, as well
as in all the parts of <HI>Italy;</HI> yet it is more con|spicuous
here, than elsewhere: for as the
<HI>Wealth</HI> of the <HI>Churches, Palaces</HI> and <HI>Convents</HI>
is astonishing, so the <HI>Poverty</HI> of the <HI>Inhabi|tants,</HI>
and the meanness of the ordinary Buil|dings,
is extremely unsuteable to the magni|ficence
of the other. When a man sees what
<HI>Italy</HI> was an Age or two ago, not to go back
so far as to remember what <HI>Rome</HI> was once;
he can hardly imagin how such a fall, such
a dispeopling, and such a poverty could be|fall
a <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Climate,</HI> that Nature has
made to be one of the richest of the world, or of
<HI>Europe</HI> at least; if the PRIESTS had not at
the same time a secret to make the <HI>Natives</HI>
miserable, in spite of all that Abundance
with which Nature has furnished them. It
were not able to withstand even an ordinary
Enemy, and it can scarce support it self. Those
<HI>Italians</HI> that have seen the Wealth and
Abundance that is in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI>
tho their <HI>Sun</HI> is less favorable, and their <HI>Cli|mate</HI>
is more unhappy, and that come home
so see their <HI>Towns</HI> deserted, and their <HI>Inha|bitants</HI>
in Raggs, speak of this sometimes
with an Indignation that is too sensible to
be at all times kept within bounds. They
speak of the difference betweeen <HI>Holland</HI> and
<PB N="5" REF="11">
<HI>Italy,</HI> like men affected when they compared
the <HI>two</HI> soils and Climates together. The
one is a <HI>soil</HI> divided between <HI>sand</HI> and <HI>turff,</HI>
preserved from the Innudations of <HI>Land-floods,</HI>
and the overflowing of the <HI>sea,</HI> at a
vast Charge, suffering often such losses as
would ruin other <HI>states,</HI> and paying great
and constant Impositions: and yet with all
these Inconveniences, and all the disadvan|tages
of a feeble <HI>sun,</HI> a stagnating and phleg|matick
<HI>Air,</HI> violent <HI>Colds,</HI> and moderate,
or at least very shorts <HI>Heats,</HI> this <HI>Countrey</HI> is
full of <HI>Wealth</HI> and <HI>People;</HI> and there is in it
such an abundance of great <HI>Towns</HI> and con|siderable
<HI>villages,</HI> and in all these there appear
so many marks of <HI>plenty,</HI> and none at all of
<HI>Want:</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> has a kind <HI>sun,</HI> long and
happy <HI>Summers,</HI> and mild <HI>Winters:</HI> a fruit|ful
and rich <HI>soil,</HI> and every thing that the <HI>In|habitants</HI>
can wish for on Natures part, to ren|der
them the Envy of the World: whereas
they are become the <HI>Scorn</HI> and contempt
of all that see them. And as much as the
<HI>Dutch</HI> seem to have acted in spite of Nature
on the one hand, in rendring themselves
much more considerable than she has Intended
they should be; so the Government of <HI>Italy</HI>
seems to have reversed the design of Nature
as much on the other hand, by reducing
the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> to such a degree of Misery,
in spite of all her Bounty: upon this subject
<PB N="6" REF="12">
the <HI>Italians</HI> will talk more freely than upon
matters of <HI>Religion:</HI> and do not stick to say,
that it flows from the share that PRIESTS
have in the Government, and that not only in
the <HI>Popes</HI> Territory, but in all the other
<HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> where they have the main
stroke. They will tell you, that <HI>Priests</HI>
have not Souls big enough, nor tender
enough, for Government: they have both a
narrowness of spirit, and a sourness of mind,
that does not agree with the Principles of
human Society: Their having so short and
so uncertain a time of governing, makes
them think only on the present, so that they
do not carry their prospect to the Happiness
of, or misery that must be the consequences
of what they do, at any considerable di|stance
of time: nor have they those Com|passions
for the Miserable with which wise
<HI>Governours</HI> ought to temper all their Coun|sells;
for a stern sourness of temper, and an
unrelenting hardness of heart, seems to be|long
to all that sort of <HI>men</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> What|soever
advances their present Interests, and
inriches their families, is preferred to all
wise, great or generous councells. Now tho
the <HI>Natives</HI> dare not carry this matter fur|ther,
yet a <HI>stranger,</HI> that thinks more freely,
and that has examined matters of Religion,
in a more Inquisitive manner, sees plainly
that all these errors in <HI>Government,</HI> are the
<PB N="7" REF="12">
effects of their <HI>Religion,</HI> and of that authori|ty
which they believe is lodged in the <HI>Pope,</HI>
chiefly and of which every <HI>Priest</HI> has so con|siderable
a share, that he is easily able to
make himself master of every mans Consci|ence
that lets him into it, and that believes
those <HI>three</HI> great branches of their power:
that <HI>they can pardon their sins, make their
God,</HI> and <HI>secure them both from Hell and Pur|gatory.</HI>
These are things of such a mighty
operation, that if it is not easy to imagine how
they should be so easily believed, yet suppo|sing
once the belief of them, all other
things flow very naturally from thence: men
are not convinced of these errors till it is too
late to come and undeceive others. It is true,
many of the <HI>Italians</HI> believe these things
as little as we do; yet this is in them rather
an effect of a loose and libertine temper, than
of study and enquiry, in a <HI>Countrey</HI> where
not only <HI>Heretical books</HI> would endanger a
man, but the bare reading even of a <HI>Latin</HI>
New <HI>Testament</HI> would give some suspition.
But the thinking men among them are led to
doubt of all things, rather from a principle of
<HI>Atheism,</HI> than of searching into matters of
Controversy: the one is much less dangerous
there, than the other would be. And indeed
as soon as a man becomes a little familiar with
any of the <HI>men</HI> of freer thoughts here, he will
soon see that the belief of their <HI>Religion</HI> has
<PB N="8" REF="13">
very little power over many of those who are
the most zealous to support it, only because
their Interest determins them. When a man has
lived some time at <HI>Rome,</HI> and has known a lit|tle
of the Mysteries of the <HI>Conclave,</HI> with the
<HI>Character</HI> both of the present and the late <HI>Popes,</HI>
particularly the weakness and Ignorance of <HI>him</HI>
that now <HI>reigns,</HI> who does not so much as
understand <HI>Latin;</HI> when a man sees how mat|ters
are carried in that <HI>Court,</HI> what are the <HI>Ma|ximes</HI>
they go by, and the <HI>Methods</HI> that they
take; when he sees what a sort of men the <HI>Car|dinals</HI>
are, men indeed of great Civility, and
of much Craft; but as to the matters of <HI>Reli|gion,</HI>
men of an equal sise both of Ignorance
and Indifference: when a man sees how all
preferments are obtained, but chiefly how the
<HI>purple</HI> is given, and how men rise up to the
<HI>Triple Crown:</HI> when, I say, a man has seen
and observed all this a little, he cannot wonder
enough at the <HI>Character</HI> that so great a part of
the World sets on that <HI>Court.</HI> The plain and
simple Arguments of Common sense work so
strong, that <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> it self is not har|der
to be believed, than that this man is Christs
<HI>Vicar,</HI> a man of <HI>Infallibility,</HI> and the source or
channel at least of divine <HI>truth.</HI> So that a
man that has given himself the opportunities
of observing these matters Critically, will feel
a persuasion of the falsehood of those preten|sions
formed so deep in him, that all the Sophi|stry
<PB N="9" REF="13">
of Argument will never be able to over|throw
it: for the plain sense of what he has
seen will apparently discover the delusion of
those Reasons, which perhaps he is not lear|ned
enough to answer: for let men say what
they will, it is no easy matter to believe in a
Contradiction to the clear Evidence of sence:
and I cannot make my self so much as doubt,
but that as <HI>Cato</HI> was wont to wonder how it
came that every one of the <HI>Heathen Priests</HI> did
not laugh when he saw another of the <HI>Trade,</HI> so
the <HI>Cardinals</HI> when they look on one another,
and a <HI>Pope</HI> even as Ignorant a one as the <HI>present
Pope</HI> is, when he receives the submissions that
are offered him by all who are of that <HI>Com|munion,</HI>
must laugh within himself when he
sees how lucky that Imposture is, which has
subdued the World into so much respect for
him, and to so great a dependance on him.
A <HI>man</HI> who sees all these things upon the place,
and is of an Age capable of making solid
Reflections, and has a due portion of Lear|ning,
must return amased, not so much at those
who being already under the <HI>Yoke,</HI> have nei|ther
knowledge nor courage enough to shake
it off, nor at those who go into it because they
find their account in it, and so hope to have a
good share of the spoil, as at <HI>those</HI> who have
shaken off the Yoke, and have got into more
<HI>Liberty</HI> and more <HI>Knowledg,</HI> and feel the hap|py
Influence of their deliverance even in their
<PB N="10" REF="14">
<HI>Civil Liberties</HI> and other <HI>Temporal</HI> Concerns, if
they should ever come so much as to delibe|rate
whether they ought to return and serve
their old and severe <HI>Masters,</HI> or not. For
my part, I speak freely to you, that I could
sooner bring my mind to believe that there
is no such thing as <HI>Instituted Religion;</HI> and
that it is enough for men to be just and honest,
civil and obliging, and to have a general re|verence
for the <HI>Deity,</HI> than ever to think that
such <HI>Stuff</HI> as the <HI>men</HI> of the <HI>Mission</HI> would im|pose
on the World can be true. Chiefly in
that part of it which relates to the <HI>Popes
Authority,</HI> after all that I have seen and
known.</P>
<P>You will perhaps think, that this is a long
digression, or at least a very improper intro|duction
to that which I told you I would
offer to you, since the relation that all this
has with the matter of the <HI>Quietists,</HI> does not
appear to be so very proper. Yet you will
perhaps change your mind, when I tell you,
that the Miseries of <HI>Italy,</HI> that the Aversion
that all men of sense there have to the Ar|tifices
of their <HI>Religion,</HI> and chiefly to the
conduct of the <HI>Regulars,</HI> and above all, of
the <HI>Iesuites,</HI> is believed the true reason that
led such numbers of <HI>men</HI> of all sorts to be
so favourable to <HI>Molinos:</HI> to which this was
rather to be ascribed, than to any Extraordi|nary
Elevation of Piety or Devotion, of which
<PB N="11" REF="14">
so little appears in that Country, that nothing
which touches only upon that Principle can
have great effects among them. Men that
are sick, turn to all sorts of remedies: and
those who are discontented, do naturally go
into every new thing that either promises re|lief,
or that wounds those that displease them.
The present state of things in <HI>Italy</HI> being such
as I have described it, you need not wonder
to find so many ready to hearken after any
thing that seemed both <HI>new</HI> and <HI>safe.</HI> For
as the Novelty gave that curiosity which
might draw in many, so the safety that see|med
to be in a Method of Devotion in
which so many of the Canonised <HI>Saints</HI>
had gone before them, and which appeared
at first authorised by the Approbation of so
many <HI>Inquisitours,</HI> made them apprehend
that there could be no danger in it. In the
recital that I am to give you, I do not pre|tend
to tell you all the whole affair: nor
will I assure you of the truth of all that you
will find here. For in matters of this nature,
in which Interest and Passion are apt to
work so strongly, there are alwayes so ma|ny
false Reports spread, and matters are so
often aggravated on the one hand, and dimini|shed
or denied on the other, that I will not say
but there may be some things here that upon
a stricter inquiry will perhaps appear not to
be well founded; yet of this I will assure
<PB N="12" REF="15">
you very positively, that I have Invented
and added nothing my self. I leave those
arts to the <HI>Italians,</HI> and the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Rome:</HI>
therefore I will tell you things nakedly
and simply, as I found them, without adding
so much as one Circumstance out of my
own Invention. I also made as much use
of my Judgment as was possible for me to do,
both in considering the Circumstances of those
with whom I talked on those heads, and the
things themselves that they said to me; so I let
pass all that seemed to be the effect of Pas|sion
or Prejudice, and only marked down
that which seemed to be true, as well as that
which I had from men whom I had reason to
believe. My <HI>Informers</HI> were men of Pro|bity
and of Sense; they were not indeed ea|sily
brought to talk of this <HI>Subject,</HI> and they
spoke of it with great Reserves: so that
there may be many defects, and possibly
some mistakes in the account that I am to offer
you; yet you must be contented with it;
for it is all that I could gather; and it is
not corrupted with any mixture of my
own.</P>

<HI>Priests Ordors,</HI> but had never any Ecclesiasti|cal
<HI>Benefice:</HI> so that he seemed to have dedi|cated
himself to the service of the <HI>Church,</HI>
without designing any Advantage by it to
<PB N="13" REF="15">
himself. He passes in <HI>Italy</HI> for a man both
of <HI>Learning</HI> and of good <HI>Sense.</HI> His course
of life has been exact, but he has never practi|sed
those Austerities that are so much mag|nified
in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and among the
Religious <HI>Orders:</HI> and as he did not affect to
practise them, so he did not recommend
them to others; nor was he fond of those
poor <HI>Superstitions</HI> that are so much magni|fied
by the trafficking men of that <HI>Church</HI>
But he gave in to the Method of the <HI>Mystical.
Divines,</HI> of which, since your studies have
not perhaps lien much that way, I shall give
you this short account.</P>
<P>That sublime, but mysterious way of <HI>De|votion,</HI>
was not set out by any of the first
<HI>Writers</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI> which is indeed a
great Prejudice against it: for how many
soever they may be, who have followed it in
the latter Ages, yet <HI>Cassians Collations,</HI>
which is a work of the midle of the <HI>fifth</HI>
Century, is the antientest Book that is writ
in that strain: for the pretended <HI>Denis</HI> the
<HI>Areopagite</HI> is now by the consent of all learned
men thought no Elder than the end of the
fifth or the beginning of the sixth Century.
Yet after these <HI>Books</HI> appeared, very few
followed the elevated strains that were in
them: the latter was indeed too dark to be
either well understood or much followed. So
that this way of <HI>Devotion,</HI> if it was practised
<PB N="14" REF="16">
in <HI>Religious Houses,</HI> yet was not much set
out to the World before <HI>S. Bernards</HI> time,
whose melting strains, tho a little too much
laboured and affected, yet have something
in them that both touches and pleases: after
him many began to write in that sublime
strain; such as <HI>Thauler, Rusbrachius, Har|phius,
Suso,</HI> but above all <HI>Thomas a Kempis.</HI>
And when for some considerable time that
way of <HI>writing</HI> was discontinued, it was again
raised up in the last Age, with much luster
by <HI>S. Teresa;</HI> and after her by <HI>Baltasar Alva|res</HI>
a <HI>Iesuit:</HI> and as <HI>England</HI> produced a <HI>Car|thusian</HI>
in King <HI>Henry</HI> the sixths time, one
<HI>Walter Hilton,</HI> who writ the <HI>Scale of Perfe|ction,</HI>
a Book Inferior to none of these I
have cited, and more simple and natural than
most of them; so of late F. <HI>Cressy</HI> has published
out of F. <HI>Bakers</HI> Papers, who was a <HI>Benedi|ctine,</HI>
a whole body of that method of <HI>Divini|ty</HI>
and <HI>Devotion.</HI> The right notion of this
way of Devotion is somewhat hard to be
well understood, by those who have not stu|died
their <HI>Metaphisicks,</HI> and is entangled
with too many of the terms of the School; yet
I shall give it to you as free of these as is
possible.</P>
<P>With relation to <HI>Devotion</HI> they consider a
man in <HI>three</HI> different degrees of Progress
and Improvement: the first is the <HI>Animal,</HI>
or the Imaginative state: in which the Im|pressions
<PB N="15" REF="16">
of <HI>Religion</HI> work strongly upon a
mans Fancy, and his sensitive Powers: this
state is but low and mean, and suteable to
the Age of a Child; and all the <HI>Devotion</HI> that
works this way, that raises a heat in the
Brain, tenderness in the Thoughts, that
draws Sighs and Tears, and that awakens ma|ny
melting <HI>Imaginations,</HI> is of a low form, va|riable,
and of no great force. The second
state is the <HI>Rational,</HI> in which those Refle|ctions
that are made on Truths, which con|vince
ones <HI>reason,</HI> carry one to all suteable
Acts: this they say is dry, and without mo|tion:
it is a Force which the Reason puts
upon the Will, and tho upon a great Variety
of Motives, and many <HI>Meditations</HI> upon
them, the mind goes thro a great many
Performances of <HI>Devotion,</HI> yet this is still a
Force put upon the <HI>will.</HI> So they reckon
that the third and highest state is the <HI>Contem|plative,</HI>
in which the <HI>Will</HI> is so united to
God, and overcome by that Union, that in
one single Act of <HI>Contemplation,</HI> it adores
God, it loves him, and resigns it self up to
him: and without wearying itself with a dry
multiplicity of <HI>Acts,</HI> it feels in one Act of Faith
more force than a whole day of Meditation
can produce. In this they say that a true <HI>Con|templative
Man,</HI> feels a secret Ioy in God,
and an acquiescing in his Will; in which the
true elevation of <HI>Devotion</HI> lies; and which is
<PB N="16" REF="17">
far above either the heats of <HI>Fancy,</HI> which ac|company
the <HI>first</HI> state, or the Subtilty of <HI>Me|ditation,</HI>
that belongs to the <HI>second</HI> state: and
they say, that the perfection of a <HI>Contemplative
state</HI> above the others, appears in this, that
wheras all men are not capable of forming
lively <HI>Imaginations,</HI> or of a fruitful Invention,
yet every man is capable of the simplicity of
<HI>contemplation:</HI> which is nothing <HI>but the silent
and humble adoration of God, that arises out of
a pure and quiet mind.</HI> But because all this
may appear a little Intricate, I shall illustratte
it by a similitude, which will make the diffe|rence
of those <HI>three states</HI> more sensible; 1. A <HI>man</HI>
that sees the exteriour of <HI>another,</HI> with whom
he has no acquaintance, and is much taken
with his face, shape, quality, and meen,
and this has a blind prevention in his favour,
and a sort of a feeble kindness for him, may be
compared to him whose <HI>Devotion</HI> consists in
lively <HI>Imaginations,</HI> and tender Impressions
on his lower and sensible Powers: 2. A <HI>man</HI>
that upon an acquaintance with <HI>another,</HI>
sees a great many reasons to value and esteem,
both his parts and his Vertues, yet in all
this he feels no inward Charm that over|comes
him, and knits his soul to the other;
so that how high soever the esteem may be, yet
it is cold and dry, and does not affect his
heart much, may be compared to one whose
<HI>Devotion</HI> consists in many Acts, and much
<PB N="17" REF="17">
<HI>Meditation.</HI> But 3dly, when a <HI>man</HI> enters into
an entire friendship with <HI>another,</HI> then one
single Thought of his Friend, affects him more
tenderly, than all that variety of reflections,
which may arise in his mind, where this U|nion
is not felt. And thus they explain the
sublime state of <HI>Contemplation.</HI> And they
reckon that all the common methods of <HI>De|votion,</HI>
ought to be considered, only as steps
to raise men up to this state: when men rest
and continue in them, they are but dead and
lifeless Forms: and if they rise above them,
they become Cloggs and Hindrances, which
amuse them with many dry Performances,
in which those who are of a higher Dispen|sation
will feel no pleasure nor advantage.
Therefore the use of the <HI>Rosary,</HI> the daily
repeating the <HI>Breviary,</HI> together with the
common <HI>Devotions</HI> to the <HI>Saints,</HI> are ge|nerally
laid aside by those who rise up to the
<HI>Contemplative</HI> State; and the chief business to
which they apply themselves, is <HI>to keep their
Minds in an inward Calm and Quiet,</HI> that
so they may in silence form simple <HI>Acts</HI> of
Faith, and feel those <HI>inward Motions</HI> and
<HI>Directions</HI> which they believe follow all those
who rise up to this Elevation. But be|cause
a man may be much deceived in those
Inspirations, therefore they recommend to
all who enter into this method, above all o|ther
things, the choice of a <HI>Spiritual Guide,</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="18">
who has a right sense and a true tast of those
matters, and is by Consequence a Competent
Judge in them.</P>
<P>This is all that I will lay before you in ge|neral,
for giving you some tast of <HI>Mo|linos's</HI>
Methods; and by this you will both
see why his <HI>Followers</HI> are called QUIE|TISTS
and why his <HI>Book</HI> is Entitled <HI>il Gui.
da Spiritualc.</HI> But if you Intend to Inform
your self more particularly of this matter,
you must seek for it, either in the <HI>Authors</HI>
that I have already mentioned, or in those of
which I am to give you some account in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">equel of this Letter. <HI>Molinos</HI> having it
seems drunk in the principles of the <HI>Contem|plative
Devotion</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> where the great
Veneration that is payed to S. <HI>Teresa</HI> gives
it much reputation, he brought over with
him to <HI>Italy</HI> a great Zeal for propagating it.
He came and setled at <HI>Rome,</HI> where he writ
his <HI>Book,</HI> and entred into a great commerce
with the <HI>men</HI> of the best Apprehensions, and
the most Elevated thoughts that he found
there. All that seemed to concur with him
in his design for setting on foot this sublimer
way, were not perhaps animated with the
same principles. Some designed sincerly to
elevate the World above those poor and trif|ling
<HI>Superstitions,</HI> that are so much in vogue,
among all the <HI>Bigots</HI> of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>
but more particularly in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and
<PB N="19" REF="18">
which are so much set on by almost all the
<HI>Regulars,</HI> who seem to place <HI>Religion</HI> chiefly
in the exact performing of them. It was
thought that others entred into the design up|on
more Indirect motives. Some perhaps from
the aversion that they bore the <HI>Regulars,</HI> were
disposed to entertain every thing that might
lead mens <HI>Devotions</HI> into other Channells, and
to a conduct different from that prescribed by
<HI>Friers</HI> and <HI>Iesuites.</HI> Some perhaps had under|standings
good enough to see the necess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ty
of correcting many things in their Wor|ship,
which yet they dur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">t not attack as
simply unlawful: so that it might appear
more safe to expose these things to the Con|tempt
of the World, by pretending to raise
men far above them: and thus they might have
hoped to have Introduced a <HI>Reformation</HI> of
many Abuses without seeming to do it. <HI>In
fine,</HI> some who seemed to enter into this mat|ter,
were men that aspired to fame, and ho|ped
by this means to raise a Name to them|selves;
and to have a Party that should depend
upon them: for in such great numbers as see|med
to imbark in this design, it is not to be
imagined that all were acted by the same mo|tives,
and that every man had as good Inten|tions
as it is probable <HI>Molinos</HI> himself
had.</P>
<P>In the year 1675. his <HI>Book</HI> was first pu|blished
with <HI>five Approbations</HI> before it. One
<PB N="20" REF="19">
of these was by the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Rheggio;</HI>
another was by the <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI>
who was likewise one of the <HI>Qualificators</HI> of
the <HI>Inquisition:</HI> another was by Fa. <HI>Martin de
Esparsa</HI> a Jesuit, that had been Divinity <HI>Pro|fessor</HI>
both at <HI>Salamanca</HI> and at <HI>Rome;</HI> and was
at that time a <HI>Qualificator of the Inquisition.</HI>
As for the rest, I refer you to the <HI>Book</HI> it self.
The <HI>Book</HI> was no sooner printed, than it was
much read and highly esteemed both in <HI>Italy</HI>
and <HI>Spain.</HI> It was considered as a <HI>Book</HI> writ
with much Clearness and great simplicity; and
this so raised the Reputation of the <HI>Author,</HI>
that his Acquaintance came to be generally
much desired: those who were in the greatest
credit in <HI>Rome,</HI> seemed to value themselves
upon his friendship. <HI>Letters</HI> were writ to
him from all places: so that a correspondence
was setled between him and those who appro|ved
of his <HI>method</HI> in many different places of
<HI>Europe.</HI> Some secular <HI>Priests</HI> both at <HI>Rome</HI>
and <HI>Naples</HI> declared themselves openly for it:
and consulted him as a sort of an Oracle upon
many occasions. But those who joyned them|selves
to him with the greatest Heartiness and
Sincerity, were some of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the <HI>Ora|tory,</HI>
in particular <HI>three</HI> of the most Eminent
of them, who were all advanced at the last
<HI>promotion</HI> of Cardinals, <HI>Coloredi, Ciceri,</HI> but
above all <HI>Petrucci,</HI> who was accounted his
<HI>Timothy.</HI> Many of the <HI>Cardinals</HI> were also
<PB N="21" REF="19">
observed to court his Acquaintance: and they
thought it no small Honour to be reckoned in
the number of <HI>Molinos's</HI> Friends. Such were
<HI>Cassanata Azolini</HI> and <HI>Carpegna;</HI> but above
all Card. <HI>d'Estrees.</HI> The last you must needs
know, is a man of great Learning: he was Am|bitious
to be thought a <HI>Reformer</HI> of some of
those Abuses, which are among them, that
are too gross to pass upon a man of his freedom
of spirit; who had been bred up in the <HI>Sorbon,</HI>
and had conversed much with Mr. de <HI>Launay.</HI>
He therefore seemed the most zealous of all
others to advance <HI>Molinos's</HI> Design: so that he
entered into a very close commerce with him.
They were oft and long together: and not|withstanding
all the distrust that a <HI>Spaniard</HI>
has naturally of a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> and that all
men have of one another, who have lived long
at <HI>Rome,</HI> yet <HI>Molinos,</HI> who was sincere and
plain-hearted, opened himself without reserve
to the <HI>Cardinal:</HI> and by his means a Corre|spondence
was setled between <HI>Molinos</HI> and
some in <HI>France:</HI> for tho the spirits of those of
that <HI>Nation</HI> go generally too quick for a way
of <HI>Devotion,</HI> that was setled and silent, yet
some were strongly Inclined to favour it even
there. Perhaps it might be considered as a
method more like to gain upon <HI>Protestants,</HI>
and to facilitate the Design of the <HI>Re-union,</HI>
that was so long talked of there. All these
things concurred to raise <HI>Molinos's</HI> Cha|racter,
<PB N="22" REF="20">
and to render his person so considera|ble.
When the <HI>Pope</HI> that now <HI>reigns,</HI> was ad|vanced
to the <HI>Throne,</HI> which was, you know,
in the year 1676. that he took most particular
notice of him: and made it Visibly apparent,
that even in all that Exaltation, he thought
it might contribute to raise his <HI>Character,</HI> if
he were considered as a friend of <HI>Molinos's</HI> and
an Encourager of his Design: For he lodged
him in an Appartment of the <HI>Palace;</HI> and put
many singular Marks of his Esteem on him.
This made him become still the more Con|spicuous,
when he had the advantage of <HI>Fa|vour</HI>
joyned to his other Qualities: tho he nei|ther
seemed to be fond of it, nor lifted up with
it. His Conversation was much desired; and
many <HI>Priests</HI> came not only to form them|selves
according to his <HI>Method,</HI> but to dispose
all their Penetents to follow it: and it grew
to be so much in vogue in <HI>Rome,</HI> that all the
<HI>Nuns,</HI> except those who had <HI>Iesuites</HI> to their
<HI>Confessors,</HI> began to lay aside their <HI>Rosaries,</HI> and
other <HI>Devotions,</HI> and to give themselves much
to the practice of <HI>Mental prayer.</HI> This <HI>way</HI> had
more Credit given to it by the translation of a
<HI>French Book,</HI> that was writ upon the same
subject, which Cardinal <HI>d'Estrees</HI> ordered to
be made. It was writ in the form of a <HI>Dialogue,</HI>
and was printed in <HI>France</HI> in the year 1669. by
the <HI>Approbation</HI> of some of the Doctors of
the <HI>Sorbon.</HI> I am able to give you no other ac|count
<PB N="23" REF="20">
of the <HI>Author,</HI> but that in the <HI>Italian</HI>
Translation he is called <HI>Francis Malleva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">la,</HI>
a blind Clergy-man. The <HI>Book</HI> being chiefly
formed upon the model of <HI>S. Terese,</HI> the
Translation of it was dedicated to the <HI>Discal|ciate
Carmelites</HI> of her Order. This did not
contribute a little for raising the credit of
<HI>Molinos's Method,</HI> since it appeared to be ap|proved
both in <HI>Italy, France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> At
the same time <HI>Fa. Petrucci</HI> writ a great many
<HI>Letters</HI> and <HI>Treatises</HI> relating to a <HI>Contempla|tive
Staete:</HI> yet he mixed in many of them,
so many Rules relating to the <HI>Devotions</HI> of
the <HI>Quire,</HI> that there was less occasion given
for censure in his <HI>Writings:</HI> They are a little
too tedious; but they were writ chiefly for
<HI>Nuns</HI> and others, that perhaps could not have
apprehended his meaning aright, if he had
expressed himself in a closer stile, and in sewer
words. Both the <HI>Iesuites</HI> and the <HI>Dominicans</HI>
began to be alarmed at the progress of <HI>Quie|tism:</HI>
they saw clearly, that their trade was
in a decay, and must decay still more and
more, if some stop was not put to the pro|gress
of this <HI>new Method:</HI> in order to this,
it was necessary to decry the <HI>Authors</HI> of it:
and because of all the Imputations in the
world <HI>Heresy</HI> is that, which makes the grea|test&punc;
Impression at <HI>Rome, Molinos</HI> and his
<HI>Followers</HI> were given out to be <HI>Hereticks.</HI> It
being also necessary to fasten a particular
<PB N="24" REF="21">
Name to every <HI>new Heresy,</HI> they branded
this with the Name of <HI>Quietism.</HI> Books were
also writ by some <HI>Iesuites</HI> against <HI>Molinos</HI>
and his Method; in which there appeared
much of that Sourness and Malignity that is
thought to be peculiar to the <HI>Society;</HI> they
were also writ with their usual candor and
sincerity. One of the Fathers <HI>Segueri</HI> took a
more dectrous Method to decry it. He be|gan
his Book magnifying the <HI>Contemplative
State</HI> highly, as Superiour to all others;
and blaming those who had said any thing
that seemed to detract from it: yet he corre|cted
all this, by saying, <HI>that very few were
capable of it;</HI> and <HI>that none ought to pretend to
it, but those who were called by God to so su|blime
a State:</HI> and by this he seemed only to
censure the Indiscretion of those <HI>Spiritual
Guides,</HI> who proposed this way of <HI>Devotion</HI>
to all persons, without distinction. He also
believed, that such as were at some times
called to it, could not remain long in so high
a state, to which God called men rather for
some happy Minutes, than for a longer con|tinuance:
therefore he thought that such per|sons
as were raised to it, ought not to fancy
that they were now got so far above all their
former helps, as never to need them any more:
so he proposed to them the accustoming
themselves still to <HI>Meditation,</HI> and to support
themselves by that when they could not
<PB N="25" REF="21">
<HI>contemplate.</HI> He censured severely some of
<HI>Molinos's</HI> expressions, such as that, <HI>He who
had God, had Christ;</HI> as if this were an aban|doning
of Christs Humanity: he also insisted
much on that of <HI>a fixed looking on God,</HI> and
the <HI>suspending of all the Powers of the Soul:</HI>
but that on which he insisted most, was
the <HI>Molinos</HI> (whom he never named, tho
he cited his Words, and described him very
plainly) made the Quiet of <HI>Contemplation</HI> to
be a <HI>State</HI> to which a man could raise him|self;
whereas he maintains, that in this Quiet
the <HI>Soul</HI> is <HI>passive,</HI> and as it were in a rapture;
and that she could not raise her self to it, but
that it was an Immediat and Extraordinary
Favour, which was only to be expected
from God, and which an humble mind could
not so much as ask of him.</P>
<P>These Disputes raised so much noise in
<HI>Rome,</HI> that the <HI>Inquisition</HI> took <HI>Notice</HI> of the
whole matter: <HI>Molinos</HI> and his <HI>Book,</HI> and
<HI>F. Petrucci's Treatises</HI> and <HI>Letters,</HI> were
brought under a second and severer Exami|nation;
and here the <HI>Iesuites</HI> were considered
as the Accusers. It is true, one of the <HI>So|ciety,</HI>
as was formerly told, had approved
<HI>Molinos</HI>'s Book; but they took care that he
should be no more seen at <HI>Rome:</HI> for he was
sent away, and it is not known whether, it is
generally believed that he is shut up within
<HI>Four Walls;</HI> but what truth soever may be in
<PB N="26" REF="22">
that, he is no more visible, so careful are
they to have all their <HI>Order</HI> speak the same
Language; and if any speak in a different stile
from the rest, they at least take care that he
shall speak no more; yet in this <HI>Examen</HI> that
was made, both <HI>Molinos</HI> and <HI>Petrucci</HI> justi|fied
themselves so well, that their Books
were again approved, and the Answers
which the <HI>Iesuites</HI> had writ, were censured
as scandalous: and in this matter <HI>Petrucci</HI> be|haved
himself so signally well, that it raised
not only the Credit of the Cause, but his
own Reputation so much, that soon after
he was made <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Iessi,</HI> which was a
new Declaration that the <HI>Pope</HI> made in their
Favours: their <HI>Books</HI> were now more esteemed
than ever, their Method was more followed,
and the Novelty of it, the opposition made to
it, by a <HI>Society</HI> that his rendred it self odious
to all the World, and the new <HI>Approbation</HI>
that was given to it after so vigorous an Ac|cusation,
did all contribute to raise the Cre|dit
and to encrease the Numbers of the Party.
<HI>F. Petrucci's</HI> behaviour in his <HI>Bishoprick,</HI>
contributed to raise his Reputation still
higher, so that his Enemy's were willing to
give him no more Disturbance; and indeed
there was less occasion given for Censure by
his <HI>Writings,</HI> than by <HI>Molino's</HI> little <HI>Book;</HI>
whose succinctness made that some Passages
were not so fully nor so cautiously expressed,
<PB N="27" REF="22">
but that there was room for making Excep|tions
to them: on the other hand, <HI>Petrucci</HI>
was rather excessively tedious, so that he had
so fully explained himself, that he very easily
cleared some small difficulties that were made
upon some of his <HI>Letters:</HI> In short, every body
was that thought either sincerely devout,
or that at least affected the Reputation of it,
came to be reckoned among the <HI>Quietists:</HI>
and if these persons were observed to become
more strict in their <HI>Lives,</HI> more retired and
serious in their mental <HI>Devotions,</HI> yet there
appeared less <HI>Zeal</HI> in their whole deportment
as to the exteriour parts of the <HI>Religion</HI> of
that <HI>Church.</HI> They were not so assiduous at
<HI>Mass,</HI> nor so earnest to procure <HI>Masses</HI> to be
said for their Friends: nor were they so fre|quently
either at <HI>Confession</HI> or in <HI>Processions:</HI>
so that the Trade of those that live by these
things was sensibly sunk: and tho the new
<HI>Approbation</HI> that was given to <HI>Molinos's
Book</HI> by the <HI>Inquisition</HI> stopt the Mouths of
his Enemies, so that they could no more
complain of it, yet they did not cease to
scatter about Surmises of all that sort of men,
as of a <HI>Cabale,</HI> that would have dangerous
consequences; they remembred the story of
the <HI>Illuminated Men</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and said, here
was a Spawn of the same Sect: they insinuated,
that they had ill Designs, and profound Se|crets
among them; that these were in their
<PB N="28" REF="23">
Hearts Enemies to the <HI>Christian Religion;</HI> and
that under a pretence of raising men to a
most sublime strain of <HI>Devotion,</HI> they in|tended
to wear out of their minds the sense of
the Death and Sacrifice of <HI>Christ,</HI> and of the
other Mysteries of <HI>Christianity:</HI> and because
<HI>Molinos</HI> was by his birth a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> it has
been given out of late, that perhaps he was
descended of a <HI>Iewish</HI> or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Race,
and that he might carry in his Blood, or in his
first Education, some Seeds of those <HI>Religions,</HI>
which he has since cultivated, with no less
Art than Zeal: yet this last Calumny has gai|ned
but little Credit at <HI>Rome;</HI> tho it is said,
that an Order has been sent to examine the
Registers of the Baptism, in the place of his
Birth, to see if his Name is to be found in it
or not.</P>
<P>Thus he saw himself attacked with great
vigour, and with an unrelenting Malice. He
took as much care as was possible to prevent,
or to shake off these Imputations; for he
writ a Treatise, of <HI>frequent and dayly Com|munion,</HI>
which was likewise approved by
some of the most learned of the <HI>Regulars</HI> at
<HI>Rome,</HI> among whom one is <HI>Martinez</HI> a <HI>Ie|suite,</HI>
the Senior <HI>Divinity Reader</HI> in their Col|ledge
at <HI>Rome.</HI> This was printed with his
<HI>Spiritual Guide,</HI> in the year 1675. and in the
<HI>Preface</HI> he protests, that he had not writ it
with any design to engage himself into mat|ters
<PB N="29" REF="23">
of Controversy, but that it was drawn
from him, by the most earnest Solicitations
of some Zealous Persons. In it he pressed a
<HI>daily Communion,</HI> by a vast number of Pas|sages
that he cited both out of the Ancient <HI>Fa|thers,</HI>
and the <HI>Schoolmen;</HI> yet he qualified
this and all his other directions in the matters
of <HI>Devotion</HI> by that which he constantly re|peats,
which is the necessity of being con|ducted
in all things by a <HI>Spiritual Guide:</HI> whe|ther
he intended to soften the aversion that
the <HI>Iesuites</HI> had to him, by refuting some
parts of Mr. <HI>Arnaud's</HI> famous Book of <HI>Fre|quent
Communion</HI> or not, I cannot tell, but
in this Discourse he answers some of the Ob|jections
that Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI> had made to <HI>Fre|quent
Communion,</HI> and in particular, to that
which he makes one main ground of restrai|ning
men from it, which was the obliging
them to go thro with their Penitence and Mor|tifications,
before they were admitted to the
<HI>Sacrament;</HI> whereas <HI>Molinos</HI> makes the
being free of <HI>Moral Sin,</HI> the only necessary
qualification. In this Discourse one sees more
of a heated Eloquence, than of severe or so|lid
Reasoning: yet it presses the point of
<HI>daily Communion,</HI> and of <HI>an inward applica|tion
of Soul to Iesus Christ, and to his Death,</HI>
so vehemently, that it might have been ho|ped
that this should have put an end to those
Surmises, that had been thrown out to de|fame
<PB N="30" REF="24">
him; as if he had designed to lay aside
the Humanity of our Saviour, by his way
of <HI>Devotion:</HI> but there is no cure for Jea|lousy;
especially when Malice and Interest
are at bottom: so new matter was found for
censure in this Discourse. He had asserted,
that there was no other Preparation necessary,
but to be free of <HI>Mortal Sin:</HI> so it was given
out, that he intended to lay aside <HI>Confession:</HI>
and tho he had advised the use of a <HI>Spiritual
Guide,</HI> in this, as well as in all other things;
yet the necessity of <HI>Confession</HI> before <HI>Commu|nion,</HI>
was not expressed: so that by this peo|ple
seemed to be set at Liberty from that Obli|gation:
and it was said, that what he advised
with relation to a <HI>Spiritual Guide,</HI> lookt ra|ther
like the taking some general Directions
and Council from ones <HI>Priest,</HI> than the co|ming
alwayes to him as the <HI>Minister</HI> of the
Sacrament of <HI>Pennance</HI> before every <HI>Com|munion;</HI>
and to support this Imputation, it
was said, that all of that <HI>Cabale</HI> had set
down this for a Rule, by which they con|ducted
their Penitents, that they might come
to the Sacrament, when they found themselves
out of the state of <HI>Mortal sin,</HI> without going
at every time to <HI>Confession;</HI> but I will not in|large
further upon the matters of <HI>Doctrine</HI> or
<HI>Devotion,</HI> in which you may think that I
have dwelt too long, for a man of my Bree|ding
and Profession: and I should think so
<PB N="31" REF="24">
my self, if I were not consining my self ex|actly
to the <HI>Memorials</HI> and <HI>Informations</HI> that
I received at <HI>Rome.</HI> You will see by the <HI>Ar|ticles</HI>
objected to the <HI>Quietists,</HI> and censured
by one of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> which I send you
with this <HI>Letter,</HI> what are all the other
points that are laid to their charge. Only I
must advertise you of one thing, that their
Friends at <HI>Rome</HI> say, that a great many of
these <HI>Articles</HI> are only the Calumnies of their
Enemies, and that they are disowned by
them: but that they have fastned these things
on them, to render them odious, and to
make them suffer with the less Pitty: which
is the putting in practice the same Maximes
which we object to their Predecessors, who
condemned the <HI>Waldenses</HI> and <HI>Albigenses</HI> of a
great many Errors of which they alwayes
protested themselves Innocent: yet the Ac|cusing
them of those horrid Opinions and
Practices, prevailed upon the Simplicity and
Credulity of the Age, to animate them with
all the Degrees of Rage against a Sect of men,
that were set forth as Monsters: the same
Maximes and Politicks are still imputed, and
perhaps not without reason to that severe
Court, which if you believe many has as
little regard to Justice as it has to Mercy.
Some have carried their Jealousies so far a|gainst
the <HI>Quietists,</HI> as to compare their
Maxims to those of <HI>Socrates</HI> his <HI>School,</HI> and
<PB N="32" REF="25">
his <HI>Followers</HI> after his death, when they saw
what his Freedom in speaking openly against
the establisht <HI>Religion</HI> had cost him: they re|solved
to comply with the received Customs
in their exteriour, and not to communicate
their <HI>Philosophy</HI> to the Vulgar; nor even to
their Disciples, till they had prepared them
well to it, by training them long in the pre|cepts
of <HI>Vertue,</HI> which they called the <HI>Pur|gative
State:</HI> and when men were well tried
and exercised in this, then they communicated
to them their sublimer Secrets: the meaning
of all which was, in short, that they would
not discover their Opinions in those points
that were contrary to the received <HI>Religion,</HI>
and to the publick <HI>Rites</HI> to any, but to those
of whom they were well assured, that they
would not betray them: and therefore they
satisfied themselves with having true and just
notions of things; but they practised out|wardly
as the Rabble did. They thought it
was no great matter what Opinions were en|tertained
by them, and that none but <HI>men</HI> of
<HI>Noble</HI> and elevated Tempers deserved that
such sublime Truths should be communicated
to them, and that the herd of the <HI>Vulgar</HI> nei|ther
were worthy nor capable of Truth,
which is too pure and too high a thing for such
mean and base minds. The Affinity of the
matter makes me remember a conversation
that I once had with one of the wittiest
<PB N="33" REF="25">
<HI>Clergy-men</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who is likewise estee|med
one of the <HI>Learnedst Men</HI> in it; He said,
<HI>The World could not bear a Religion calculated
only for</HI> Philosophers: <HI>The people did not know
what it was to think&punc; and to govern themselves by
the Impressions that abstracted thoughts made on
their minds: they must have outward things to
strike upon their senses and Imaginations, to a|muse,
to terrify and to excite them: so</HI> legends,
<HI>dreadful</HI> stories <HI>and a pompous</HI> Worship <HI>were
necessary to make the Impressions of</HI> Religion <HI>go
deep into such course souls: for a Lancet,</HI> said
he, <HI>can open a vein, but an Axe must fell
down a Tree;</HI> so he concluded, <HI>that the</HI> Refor|mation
<HI>had reduced the</HI> Christian Religion <HI>to
such severe terms, that among us it was only a</HI>
Religion <HI>for</HI> Philosophers: <HI>and since few were
capable of that strength of thought:</HI> he conclu|ded,
<HI>that if the</HI> Church <HI>of</HI> Rome <HI>had perhaps
too much of this exteriour pomp, those of the</HI> Re|formation
<HI>had stript it too much, and had not
left enough of garnishing, and of the bells and
feathers for amusing the rable.</HI> The speculation
seems pretty enough, if <HI>Religion</HI> were to be
considered only as a contrivance of ours, to be
fitted by us to the tempers and humours of
<HI>People;</HI> and not as a Body of <HI>Divine Truths,</HI>
that are conveyed to us from heaven.</P>
<P>Thus was <HI>Molinos's</HI> method censured or
approved in <HI>Rome,</HI> according to the different
Apprehensions and Interests of those that
<PB N="34" REF="26">
made Reflections upon it. But the <HI>Iesuites</HI> fin|ding
they were not so omnipotent in this <HI>Pon|tificate,</HI>
as they have been formerly, resolved
to carry their point another <HI>way.</HI> I need not
tell you how great an Ascendant <HI>F. la Chaise</HI>
has gained over that <HI>Monarch,</HI> that has been
so long the <HI>terrour of Europe:</HI> and how much
all the <HI>Order</HI> is now in the Interests of <HI>France.</HI>
The <HI>Zeal</HI> with which that <HI>King</HI> has been extir|pating
<HI>Heresy,</HI> Furnishes them with abun|dance
of matter for high <HI>Panegyricks;</HI> since that
which in the opinion of many will pass down
to posterity, for the lasting reproach of a
<HI>Reign,</HI> which in its former parts has seemed
to approach even to <HI>Augustus's</HI> Glory, but
has received in this a stain, which with Indif|ferent
men passes for a blind, poor-spirited and
furious <HI>Bigottry,</HI> and is represented by <HI>Prote|stants</HI>
as a complication of as much Treachery
and Cruelty as the World ever saw; yet
among the <HI>bigots</HI> it is set forth as the brightest
side of that Glorious <HI>Reign:</HI> and therefore it has
been often cited by them with relation to the
cold correspondence that is observed to be be|tween
the <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and that at <HI>Versailles,</HI>
that nothing was more Incongruous, than to
see the <HI>Head of the Church</HI> dispute so obsti|natly
with its <HI>Eldest son</HI> such a trifle, as the mat|ter
of the <HI>Regale,</HI> and that with so much ea|gerness;
and that he shew'd so little regard
to so great a <HI>Monarch,</HI> that seemed to sacrifice
<PB N="35" REF="26">
all his own <HI>Interests</HI> to those of his <HI>Religion&punc;</HI>
It is believed, that the <HI>Iesuits</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> propo|sed
the matter of <HI>Molinos</HI> to <HI>F. la Chaise,</HI> as a fit
reproach to be made to the <HI>Pope,</HI> in that <HI>Kings</HI>
name, that while he himself was Imploying
all possible means to extirpate <HI>Heresy</HI> out of his
<HI>Dominions.</HI> The <HI>Pope</HI> was cherishing it in his
own <HI>Palace:</HI> and that while the <HI>Pope</HI> preten|ded
to such an unyielding <HI>Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Rights</HI>
of the <HI>Church,</HI> he was entertaining a person
who was corrupting the <HI>doctrine,</HI> or at least
the <HI>devotion,</HI> of that <HI>Body,</HI> of which he had
the honour to be the <HI>Head.</HI> But here I must
add a thing which comes very uneasily from
me, and yet I cannot keep my word to you,
of giving you a faithful account of all that I
could learn of this matter at <HI>Rome,</HI> without
mentioning it. I do not pretend to affirm it
is true, for I only tell you what is believed at
<HI>Rome,</HI> and not what I believe my self, nor
what I would have you to believe; for I know
you have so high an esteem of Cardinal <HI>d'E|strees,</HI>
that you will not easily believe any thing
that is to his Disadvantage. It is then said,
that <HI>he</HI> being commanded by the <HI>Orders</HI> that
were sent him from the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> to
prosecute <HI>Molinos</HI> with all possible vigour, re|solved
to sacrifice his old <HI>Friend,</HI> and all that
is sacred in <HI>Friendship,</HI> to the Passion he has for
His Masters <HI>Glory;</HI> finding then that there
was not matter enough for an Accusation
<PB N="36" REF="27">
against <HI>Moliuos,</HI> he resolved to supply that
defect himself; so that he, who was once as
deep as any man alive in the whole Secret of
this Affair, went and Informed the <HI>Inquisition</HI>
of many particulars, for which tho there was
no other evidence but his Testimony, yet that
was sufficient to raise a great Storm against
<HI>Molinos;</HI> and upon this delation, <HI>he</HI> and a
few others of his friends were put in the <HI>Inqui|sition;</HI>
but this was managed so secretly, that
all that is pretended to be known concerning
it, is, that upon a new Prosecution both <HI>Mo|linos</HI>
and <HI>Petrucci</HI> were brought before the
<HI>Inquisition</HI> in 1684. <HI>Petrucci</HI> was soon absolved;
for there was so little objected to him, and he
answered that with so much Judgement and
Temper, that he was quickly dismissed; and
tho <HI>Molinos's</HI> matter was longer in agitation,
yet is was generally expected that he should
have been acquitted. In conclusion, a Corre|spondence
held by him all <HI>Europe</HI> over, was
objected to him: but that could be no Crime,
unless the matter of that Correspondence
was Criminal: some suspitions papers were
found in his Chamber, but as he himself ex|plained
them, nothing could be made out of
them, till Cardinal <HI>d'Estrees</HI> delivered a <HI>Let|ter</HI>
and a <HI>Message</HI> from the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> to
the <HI>Pope,</HI> as was formerly mentioned: and
that the <HI>Cardinal</HI> added, that he himself could
prove against <HI>Molinos,</HI> more than was ne|cessary
<PB N="37" REF="27">
to shew that he was guilty of <HI>Heresy.</HI>
The <HI>Pope</HI> said not a word to this, but left the
matter to the <HI>Inquisitors;</HI> and the <HI>Cardinal</HI>
went to them, and gave other senses of those
doubtful Passages, that were in <HI>Molinos's
Books</HI> and <HI>Papers,</HI> and pretended that he knew
from himself, what his true Meaning in them
was. The <HI>Cardinal</HI> owned, that he had lived
with him in the Appearances of Friendship:
but he said, he had early smelled out an ill de|design
in all that matter; that he saw of what
dangerous consequence it was like to be; but
yet, that he might fully discover what was at
the bottom of it, he confessed, he seemed to
assent to several things, which he detested:
and that by this means he saw into their secret,
and knew all the steps they made, he still cau|tiously
observing all that past among them till
it should be necessary for him to discover and
crush this Cabal. I need not tell you how
severely this is censured, by those who be|live
it. I would rather hope, that it is not
true, how positively soever it may be affir|med
at <HI>Rome;</HI> but tho it is hard to reconcile
such a way of proceeding with the common
rules of human Society and of Vertue, yet at
<HI>Rome</HI> a <HI>Zeal</HI> for the <HI>Faith,</HI> and against <HI>Heresie,</HI>
supersedes all the Bonds of <HI>Morality</HI> or <HI>Hu|mainty,</HI>
which are only the common <HI>Vertues</HI> of
<HI>Heathens.</HI></P>
<P>In short, what truth soever may be in this
<PB N="38" REF="28">
particular, relating to the <HI>Cardinal,</HI> it is cer|tain
that <HI>Molinos</HI> was clapt up by the <HI>Inquisi|tion</HI>
in <HI>May</HI> 1685. and so an end was put to all
Discourses relating to him: and in this silence
the business of the <HI>Quietists</HI> was laid to sleep,
till the ninth of <HI>February</HI> 1687. that of a sudden
it broke out again in a much more surprising
manner.</P>
<P>The Count <HI>Vespiniani</HI> and his <HI>Lady,</HI> Don
<HI>Paulo Rocchi,</HI> Confessor to the Prince <HI>Borg|hese,</HI>
and some of his family, with several
others, in all 70 <HI>persons,</HI> were clapt up. Among
whom many were highly esteemed both for
their <HI>Learning</HI> &amp; <HI>Piety.</HI> The things laid to the
charge of the <HI>Churchmen</HI> were their neglecting
to say their <HI>Breviary;</HI> and for the rest, they
were accused for their going to <HI>Communion</HI>
without a going at every time first to <HI>Confes|sion:</HI>
and in a word, it was said, that they ne|glected
all the exterior parts of their <HI>Religion,</HI>
and gave themselves up wholly to Solitude and
<HI>inward Prayer.</HI> The Countesse <HI>Vespiniani</HI> made
a great noise of this matter; for she said, she
had never revealed her <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Devotion</HI> to
any Mortal, but to her <HI>Confessor,</HI> and so it
was not possible that it could come to their
knowledge any other way, but by his be|traying
that <HI>Secret:</HI> and she said, it was time
for people to give over going to <HI>Confession,</HI> if
<HI>Priests</HI> made this use of it, to discover those
who trusted their <HI>secretest</HI> Thoughts to them;
<PB N="39" REF="28">
and therefore she said, that in all time coming,
she would make her <HI>Confessions</HI> only to God.
This had got vent, and I heard it generally
talked up and down <HI>Rome:</HI> so the <HI>Inquisitors</HI>
thought it more fitting to dismiss <HI>Her</HI> and her
<HI>Husband,</HI> than to give any occasion to lessen
the credit of <HI>Confession;</HI> they were therefore
let out of prison, but they were bound to ap|pear
whensoever they should be called upon.
I cannot express to you, the Consternation
that appeared both in <HI>Rome</HI> and in many other
parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> when in <HI>a months</HI> time about 200
<HI>persons</HI> were put in the <HI>Inquisition:</HI> and that
all of the sudden, a <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Devotion,</HI> that
had passed up and down <HI>Italy</HI> for the highest
Elevation to which mortals could aspire, was
found to be <HI>Heretical,</HI> and that the chief
promoters of it were shut up in <HI>prison.</HI></P>
<P>But the most surprising part of the whole
story, was, that the <HI>Pope</HI> himself came to be sus|pected
as a favourer of this new <HI>Heresy:</HI> so
that on the 13th. of <HI>February</HI> some were de|puted
by the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> to exa|min
him, not in the quality of <HI>Christs Vicar,</HI>
or <HI>St. Peters successor,</HI> but in the single quality
of <HI>Benedict Odescalchi:</HI> what passed in that
Audience, was too great a Secret for me to be
able to penetrate into it: but upon this there
were many and strange Discourses up and
down <HI>Rome:</HI> &amp; while we <HI>Hereticks</HI> were upon
that asking, where was the <HI>Popes Infallibility?</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="29">
I remember a very pretty <HI>Answer</HI> that was
made me. They said, the <HI>Popes Infallibility</HI>
did not flow from any thing that was Personal
in him, but from the care that Christ had of
his <HI>Church:</HI> for a <HI>Pope,</HI> said one, may be a
<HI>Heretick</HI> as he is a private man: but Christ,
who said to <HI>St. Peter, feed my sheep,</HI> will cer|tainly
so order matters that the <HI>Pope</HI> shall never
decree <HI>Heresy,</HI> and by consequence shall never
give the flock <HI>Poyson</HI> instead of the <HI>Bread</HI> of
<HI>Life;</HI> while the <HI>Popes Heresy</HI> was only a perso|nal
thing, it could have no other effect but to
damn himself: but if he decreed <HI>Heresy,</HI> this
corrupted the whole <HI>Church:</HI> and since Christ
had committed all the <HI>flock</HI> to the <HI>Popes</HI> care,
it ought to be believed, that he would never
suffer them to pronounce <HI>Heresy ex Cathedra,</HI>
as they call it. This had some colour in it,
that was plausible: but the shift of which ano|ther
served himself, seemed Intolerable. He
said, the <HI>Pope</HI> could never decree <HI>Heresy:</HI> for
which he argued thus: he must be a <HI>Heretick</HI> be|fore
he can decree it; and upon that he gave me
many Authorities to prove, that in the minute
that the <HI>Pope</HI> became <HI>a Heretick,</HI> he fell <HI>ipso
facto</HI> from his Dignity; and therefore he said,
the <HI>Pope</HI> could not decree <HI>Heresy;</HI> for he must
have fallen from his <HI>Chair,</HI> and have forfeited
his Authority, before he could possibly do it:
so that he was no more <HI>Pope.</HI> This lookt so
like a Juggle of the <HI>Schools,</HI> that I confess it
<PB N="41" REF="29">
made no great Impression on me. Imagine
what a thing it would be, to see a <HI>King</HI> accused
of <HI>Treason</HI> by one of his own <HI>Courts;</HI> and then
you have fancied somewhat that comes near
this attempt of the <HI>Inquisition's:</HI> which being
a <HI>Court</HI> authorised by the <HI>Pope,</HI> yet had the
Boldness to examin himself: and it had cer|tainly
been an odd piece of News, if upon the
<HI>Popes</HI> Answers, the <HI>Inquisition</HI> had stained him
with the Imputation of <HI>Heresy,</HI> and had lodged
him in the <HI>Minerva.</HI> Upon the discourse to
which this gave occasion, I have heard the
Authority of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Inquisition</HI> magnified
to so Extravagant a degree, that some have
asserted, it was in some respects <HI>superiour</HI>
even to the <HI>Pope</HI> himself. Two days after
that, the <HI>Inquisition</HI> sent a Circular <HI>Letter</HI> to
Card. <HI>Cibo,</HI> as the chief <HI>Minister,</HI> to be sent
by him all about <HI>Italy,</HI> of which I send you a
Copy in <HI>Italian:</HI> for tho it ought to have been
writ in <HI>Latin,</HI> yet I do not know how it
came to be writ in <HI>Italian:</HI> for the writing it
in the Vulgar language, was censured not
only as an Indecent thing, but as that which
made the matter more publick; it was ad|dressed
to all <HI>Prelats;</HI> and it warns them,
that wheras many <HI>Schools</HI> and <HI>Fraternities</HI>
were formed in several parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> in which
some persons, under a pretence of leading
people into the <HI>Wayes of the Spirit,</HI> and to the
prayer of <HI>quietness,</HI> they instilled in them many
<PB N="42" REF="30">
abominable <HI>Heresies;</HI> therefore a stricte charge
was given to dissolve all these <HI>Societies:</HI> and
to oblige all the <HI>Spiritual Guides</HI> to tread in
the known Paths: and in particular, to take
care, that none of that sort should be suffered to
have the Direction of the <HI>Nunneries,</HI> Order
was likewise given to proceed in the way of
Justice against those who should be found
guilty of these abominable <HI>Errors.</HI> After this
a strict enquiry was made into all the <HI>Nunne|ries</HI>
of Rome; for most of their <HI>Directors</HI> and
<HI>Confessours</HI> were found to be engaged into this
new <HI>Method.</HI> It was found that the <HI>Carmelites,</HI>
the <HI>Nuns</HI> of the <HI>Conception,</HI> of the <HI>Palestrina,</HI>
and <HI>Albano,</HI> were wholly given up to <HI>Prayer</HI>
and <HI>Contemplation,</HI> and that instead of their
<HI>Beads,</HI> and their <HI>Hours,</HI> and the other Devo|tions
to <HI>Saints,</HI> or <HI>Images,</HI> they were much
alone, and oft in the Exercise of <HI>Mental
Prayer:</HI> and when they were asked, why they
had laid aside the use of their <HI>Beads,</HI> and their
antient <HI>Forms;</HI> their Answer was, that their
<HI>Directors</HI> had advised them, to wean them|selves
from these things, as being but Rude
Beginnings, and Hindrances to their further
progress: they justified also their Practice
from those <HI>Books</HI> that had been lately publi|shed
by the approbation of the <HI>Inquisitors</HI>
themselves, such as <HI>Molinos</HI> and <HI>Petrucci's</HI>
Books. When report was made of this mat|ter
to the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> they sent Orders to take
<PB N="43" REF="30">
out of the <HI>Nuns</HI> hands all those <HI>Boaks,</HI> and
such Forms of <HI>Devotion</HI> as were written in
that strain; and they required them to return
again to the use of their <HI>Beads,</HI> and their other
abandoned <HI>Forms,</HI> which was no small morti|fication
to them. The Circular <HI>Letter</HI> pro|duced
no great effects; for most of the <HI>Italian
Bishops</HI> were either extream unconcerned in
all those matters, or were Inclined to <HI>Molinos</HI>'s
<HI>Method:</HI> and whereas it was Intended, that
this as well as all the other <HI>Orders</HI> that come
from the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> should he kept secret,
yet it got abroad, and <HI>Copies</HI> of it were in all
peoples hands, so that this gave the <HI>Romans</HI>
the more occasion to discourse of these mat|ters,
which troubled the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> ex|treamly,
who love not to have the World
look into their Proceedings, nor to descant
upon them: they blamed Card. <HI>Cibo,</HI> as if
this matter was grown so publick by his means:
but he on the other hand blamed the <HI>Inquisi|tors</HI>
for it, and his <HI>Secretary</HI> blamed both.
It was also said, that the <HI>Pope</HI> was not plea|sed
with Card. <HI>Cibo's</HI> conduct, and that he
thought he had suffered this matter to go too
far, without giving a check to the <HI>Inquisi|tors,</HI>
when it might have been more easily
done; wheras now matters are gone to
that height, that many think they cannot
end without some very great Scandal.
For the <HI>Quality</HI> of the <HI>Prisoners</HI> is considerable;
<PB N="44" REF="31">
some of Cardinal <HI>Petrucci's Domesticks,</HI> and
both his <HI>Secretary</HI> and his <HI>Nephew</HI> were of
the Number; and tho the <HI>Cardinal</HI> himself
came to <HI>Rome</HI> soon after, yet he was there
for some time <HI>Incognito.</HI> It is generally belie|ved,
that both he and the Cardinal <HI>Caraffa,</HI>
and Cardinal <HI>Ciceri,</HI> who is Bishop of <HI>Como,</HI>
are in great apprehensions of a storm from
the <HI>Inquisition:</HI> and the Ceremony of giving
them their <HI>Hats</HI> being so long delayed, was
generally ascribed to some complaints that
it seems the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> made; yet in Conclu|sion
they appeared in <HI>Publick,</HI> and had there
<HI>Hats</HI> given them. The Duke of <HI>Ceri, Don
Livio,</HI> that is the <HI>Popes Nephew,</HI> is believed
to be deeply engaged in the matter: for the
Count <HI>Vespiniani,</HI> who was first seised on, is
his particular Friend and Favorite: and is a
sort of a Domestick of his. <HI>Don Livio</HI> him|self
is likewise a person of a Melancholy
Temper, that is much retired; and this at
present is enough to make a man pass there
for a <HI>Quietist.</HI> He went from <HI>Rome</HI> to a
House he has not far from <HI>Civitavecchia,</HI> to
avoid, as was thought, the falling into the
hands of the <HI>Inquisitors.</HI> The <HI>Pope</HI> writ oft
for him, before he could prevail with him
to return; and it was said, that he did not
think himself secure even after all the Assu|rances
that the <HI>Pope</HI> gave him, that no harm
should come to him; for it might be justly
<PB N="45" REF="31">
enough apprehended, that the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI>
who had been so hardy as to examin the
<HI>Pope,</HI> would make no Ceremony with his
<HI>Nephew,</HI> if they found matter against him.</P>
<P>But among all that were clapt up, Father
<HI>Appiani</HI> was the man that surprised the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
the most: he was seised on the first Sun|day
of <HI>April;</HI> he was esteemed the learnedest
and Eminentest <HI>Iesuite</HI> that was in the whole
<HI>Roman Colledge.</HI> This did not a little morti|fie
the <HI>Society;</HI> one of their <HI>Fathers</HI> had
approved of <HI>Molinos</HI>'s Book, and now ano|ther
was found to be engaged in this matter:
upon which a <HI>Priest,</HI> that was indeed no
Friend to their Order, said to me, <HI>that this
was their true Genius, to have men among them
of all sides;</HI> that so which side soever pre|vailed,
they might have some among them,
that should have a considerable share in the
Honour of the Victorious. And thus if <HI>Mo|linos</HI>'s
Method had been established, then
they would have gloried as much in <HI>Esparza</HI>
and <HI>Appiani,</HI> as they are now ashamed of
them. It is likely that they had not discovered
<HI>Appiani</HI>'s favouring the party, otherwise no
doubt they had been before-hand with the
<HI>Inquisition,</HI> and had shut him up as they did
<HI>Esparza;</HI> and so have covered themselves
from the reproach of having a man that fa|voured
<HI>Heresy</HI> among them. But the Con|fidence
of that <HI>Society</HI> is an Original; and since
<PB N="46" REF="32">
I have this occasion to mention them, I will
here digress a little from the business of
<HI>Quietism,</HI> to give you account of some of their
Practices at <HI>Rome,</HI> with relation to <HI>English
Affairs,</HI> with which I was made acquainted
during my stay there.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Iesuit</HI> belonging to the <HI>English</HI>
House, F. <HI>Cann,</HI> well known in <HI>England,</HI> by
some of his <HI>Writings,</HI> and in particular by
one against the <HI>Oath of Allegeance,</HI> in which
he pleads for the <HI>Popes</HI> Power of deposing
<HI>Princes;</HI> it seems he was sorry to see that the
Discourse which he had writ against the ta|king
that <HI>Oath,</HI> had no better effect, and that
the <HI>Papists</HI> generally took it: so he resolved
to carry this matter further, therefore tho
he had no other Character but that of a <HI>Fa|ther</HI>
of the <HI>Society;</HI> he proposed at <HI>Rome,</HI> that
a formal <HI>Oath,</HI> abjuring the <HI>Oath of Alle|geance,</HI>
should be taken by all who had ta|ken
the other; and that for all that should
be received to be <HI>Students</HI> in that House, in
all time coming, they should be bound by an
<HI>Oath</HI> never to swear the <HI>Oath of Allegeance:</HI>
since he said, a time might come, in which it
should be necessary for their Interests, that
they should be under no such tie to a <HI>Here|tical
Prince:</HI> But because it was not safe for
them to enjoin any new <HI>Oath,</HI> without an
order from the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Rota,</HI> according
to the Forms there, it was necessary to pre|sent
<PB N="47" REF="32">
a <HI>Memorial</HI> for this: and that ought to
come from the <HI>Protector of the Nation con|cerned:</HI>
So he ought to have addressed him|self
to Cardinal <HI>Howard;</HI> but the <HI>Cardinal</HI>'s
temper, and his principles, with relation to
Civil Obedience, were so well known, that
F. <HI>Cann</HI> thought to carry the business without
his having any share in it. Yet he found him|self
mistaken; for the <HI>Iudges</HI> of the <HI>Rota</HI> were
surprised at the Proposition; and gave notice
of it to the <HI>Pope,</HI> who lookt upon it as a
thing of very bad consequence: and askt
Cardinal <HI>Howard,</HI> if it had been set on by
any direction from him; for it seems his Name
was made use of, tho without his know|ledg.
The <HI>Cardinal</HI> was surprised at it, and
highly resented the Impudence of F. <HI>Cann:</HI>
He sent a Complaint of it to the <HI>General</HI> of
the <HI>Society,</HI> who, to give the <HI>Cardinal</HI> some
content, gave <HI>Cann</HI> a Reprimand, and sent
him out of <HI>Rome:</HI> But the <HI>Iesuites</HI> carry a
Grudge in their Hearts to the <HI>Cardinal</HI> for
this, and other things: and this appeared
very visibly during the Earl of <HI>Castlemain's</HI>
Embassay: for tho he lodged for some time in
the <HI>Cardinal's Palace,</HI> yet he gave himself up
so intirely to the Conduct of the <HI>Iesuites,</HI>
that the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was quite shut out of the
Councils: and while Fa. <HI>Morgan</HI> came at all
hours to the <HI>Ambassadour,</HI> even in his night
Gown and Shippers, which was thought
<PB N="48" REF="33">
an unusual thing at <HI>Rome,</HI> where publick
persons live in an exactness of Ceremony:
once the <HI>Cardinal</HI> was made to wait in the
Antichamber, while the <HI>Father</HI> was within
entertaining the <HI>Ambassadour</HI> in this lasy
dress, who coming out in it, the <HI>Cardinal</HI>
was so provoked at this Indignity, that was
done him, and at the <HI>Iesuites</HI> Insolence, that
he threatned to sling him down stairs, if he
ever presumed to come within his House a|gain
in that Habit: and indeed, a <HI>Cardinal</HI>
makes so great a figure in <HI>Rome,</HI> that such an
usage of him was thought a little Extraordi|nary,
but the <HI>Cardinal</HI> is of so mild a temper,
and the <HI>Iesuites</HI> are so violent, as to be rec|koned
the <HI>Horns of the Beast,</HI> that no won|der
if a Sympathy of temper made the
<HI>Ambassador</HI> fall in more naturally with them.</P>
<P>But I will now return to the <HI>Quietists,</HI>
from whom, the particular regard that I hear
to the Order of the <HI>Iesuites,</HI> has diverted me
so long. The <HI>Prisons</HI> of the <HI>Holy Office</HI> were
full, and the Terrour of this matter had
struck so many, that no body could guess
when or where it should stop. It is said, that
the <HI>Inquisitours</HI> have found in some of their
Examinations, that they have to do with
men that are learneder than themselves: and
that their Prisoners are steady and resolute. It
is also said, that their Friends abroad have ex|pressed
a great concern for them, and for
<PB N="49" REF="33">
the cause of their Sufferings, and that many
Letters have been writ to the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI>
wishing them to consider well what they do
to their Prisoners; and assuring them, that
they will maintain their Interests: and that
they are ready to seal them with their Blood.
It is certain, the <HI>Pope</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Cibo</HI> are
much troubled, to see that this matter is
gone so far, and is now so much talked of.
Cardinal <HI>Petrucci</HI> is still much in the <HI>Popes</HI>
favour, and was suffered not long ago to go
visit <HI>Molinos,</HI> with whom he had a long con|versation
all alone, but the subject and the
effects of it are not known: yet a severe Sen|tence
is expected against <HI>Molinos.</HI> Those
that speak the mildest, think he will be a
Prisoner for life: but a little time will shew
more than I can presume to tell you. It is a
terrible thing to have the whole body of the
<HI>Regulars</HI> against one, who according to the
estimate that is made at <HI>Rome,</HI> are about
500000. Persons, and of that number it is
said the <HI>Iesuites</HI> make 40000. In the City of
<HI>Naples</HI> alone it is believed the <HI>Regulars</HI> and
other Ecclesiasticks amount to 25000. so it is
very likely, that when such Bodies, and <HI>Mo|linos</HI>
are in the ballance, <HI>Cajaphas</HI>'s Resolution
may once more take place: <HI>It is expedient that
one man should die, rather than that those Nati|ons
of Regulars should perish,</HI> or their Trade
and Profits be lessned. But to come to an end,
<PB N="50" REF="34">
the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> have prepared the world for any
Judgments that they may pass in this matter,
by ordering one of their number, to draw up
a Censure of 19. Articles, which he pretends
to have collected out of the <HI>Writings</HI> and
<HI>Doctrines</HI> of the <HI>Quietists,</HI> and thus by repre|senting
them so odiously, they have as much
as in them lies, prevented those Compassions
which may perhaps be kindled by the suffe|rings
of those whom they may condemn as
guilty of those censured Opinions. I have
now given you all the Informations that I
could pick up of this matter, with all possi|ble
sincerity; for I have represented this bu|siness
to you, just as it was set before my self,
without making any Additions to it, or inter|posing
my poor judgment in such a matter,
which I leave to you, and to such as you are.
I conclude, referring you for a further light
into this Affair to the Censure of the <HI>Inquisi|tors,</HI>
which I procured in <HI>Italian,</HI> for tho pro|bably
it is written Originally in <HI>Latin,</HI> yet I
could not get a Copy of the <HI>Latin</HI> Censure,
and so was forced to content my self with
this that follows. It appears by it, how low
the study both of <HI>Divinity</HI> and of the <HI>Scrip|tures</HI>
is sunk at <HI>Rome:</HI> some few strictures
will be found on the Margin of the <HI>English
Translation</HI> of this <HI>Censur,</HI> which I have ad|ded,
because some perhaps may desire to see
this, who do not understand <HI>Italian.</HI></P>

<P>In this Article the Snake does not hide him|self
in the Grass, but shews
himself very visibly:<NOTE PLACE="marg">But it is v&egrave;ry poor|ly refuted, certainly <HI>Job</HI> said many very hard things, which God who knew the sincerity of his heart, and the strength of his temtations, did not lay to his charge.</NOTE> since by
this it is plain, that the <HI>Quie|tists</HI>
will be sensual <HI>Libertines</HI>
under the name of Spiritual
and Contemplative Persons.
The Example that they
bring of <HI>Iob</HI> shews clearly
how little they understand
the Scripture. <HI>Iob</HI> did not
sin outwardly, neither
against his Neighbour nor against God in
what he said, cap. 19. ver. 6. as <HI>Pineda (tom. 2.
in Iob 235)</HI> has evidently proved from the
literal sense of the words: he did not sin against
his Neighbour, as appears by the Expositions
of the Holy <HI>Fathers,</HI> from whom we are to
learn the true sense of the Scriptures. And
to end this matter in a few words, that Grace
with which God assists us at all times, is such,
that we co-operating with it, may over|come
all the Temtations of our Enemies. And
Christ has said to all in the person of <HI>S. Paul,
My Grace is sufficient for thee:</HI> therefore a Con|templative
Person cannot be pushed on by any
violence or necessity whatsoever, to any Ex|ternal
Act of Sin.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="53">
It is not easie to judge whether these <HI>Arti|cles</HI>
are faithfully drawn out, or truly repre|sented:
for it is probable, that <HI>Malice</HI> has a
large share in some of them, chiefly in this last,
which leads to down-right <HI>Libertinage;</HI> tho
others have rather suspected, that all tended
to an Elevated <HI>Deism:</HI> yet it is certain, that
if there is much Poison in these <HI>Articles,</HI> the
Antidote of the <HI>Censure</HI> is so feeble, that it
cannot have a strong Operation; and it shews
how little the <HI>Scripture</HI> and true <HI>Divinity</HI> is
understood at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the former <HI>Letter,</HI> I told you all that I
could learn of this matter, during my stay
at <HI>Rome,</HI> but having left in <HI>Iuly,</HI> I prevailed
with one to give me an account of the Con|clusion
of this Affair, of which I send you a
Copy: for tho I know all the <HI>Gazettes</HI> of
<HI>Europe</HI> will be full of the Decision and end
that is believed to be put to the business of
<HI>Quietism,</HI> yet you know too well, how
little one ought to depend on such Relations:
all the news of this matter, will either be
that which is writ by the direction of the
<HI>Inquisition,</HI> or by the Strangers that are there,
and pick up such things as they find among
the <HI>Romans,</HI> who are ever true to the old
<PB N="89" REF="53">
Character that <HI>Iuvenal</HI> gave of that <HI>City,</HI></P>
<P>Sequitur fortunam, ut semper, &amp; odit
Damnator.</P>
<P>Therefore I will give you an account of
this business, on which you may depend, in the
words of a Letter writ me from <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Now this great Affair, upon which men
have so long lookt with so much expectation,
is at an end: and a party that was believed to
be a Million strong, is now either quite extin|guisht,
or at least oppressed with a great deal
of Infamy: and Mr. <HI>Molinos,</HI> who has lived
above twenty years in this <HI>City,</HI> in the highest
Reputation possible, is now as much hated
as ever he was admired: he is not only consi|dered
as a Condemned, and an Abjured <HI>Here|tick,</HI>
but he is said to have been convicted of
much Hypocrisy, and of a very Iewd course
of life; which is so firmly believed by the
<HI>Romans,</HI> that he was treated by them on the
day of his Abjuration, with all possible In|dignities;
but the people as they shewed their
affections to him, by their cries of <HI>Fire, Fire,</HI>
so were ready to have sacrificed him to their
rage, if he had not been well defended by the
<HI>Sbiri</HI> and Guards that were about him. And
it would be a crime enough at present, to re|commend
a man to the care of the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI>
if he should seem to doubt either of his Here|sy,
or of the Scandals of his life. All the
party is extreamly sunk: Cardinal <HI>Petrucci</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="54">
himself lives in <HI>Rome</HI> as if he were in a desert;
for no Body goes to visit him, and he stirs as
little abroad: nor is it thought that he will
escape: there are four sent by the <HI>Inquisition</HI>
to his Diocess of <HI>Iessi</HI> to examin his beha|viour
there: there is also a discourse, that has
lately appeared at <HI>Rome,</HI> that was secretly prin|ted,
of which he is suspected to be the Author,
which is an <HI>Apology for Quietism,</HI> that gives
great offence. It is said, that the <HI>Inquisitors</HI>
had full proofs against <HI>Molinos,</HI> by fourteen
Witnesse; of whom eight indeed came and
offered their Depositions of their own accord,
and the other six were forced to declare the
truth, which raises the Credit of their Testi|mony:
since his Abjuration, it is said that ma|ny
of his Followers have abjured in private,
and that besides the Prisoners that are in their
hands, great numbers come in every day to
accuse themselves, and to offer themselves to
pennance, these are all very gently dismissed
by the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI> who are now as much cen|sured
by the <HI>Romans</HI> for their excessive mild|ness,
as ever they have been blamed by others
for their rigour: and those secret Abjurations
are believed to be all the Severity that they
will practise on this Occasion; for it is said that
even <HI>F. Appiani</HI> the <HI>Iesuite</HI> will be abjured in
secret; tho some say, he is madd, others that
he is become deaf and dumb, and not a few
believe that he is dead: so uncertain are all
<PB N="91" REF="54">
Reports at present. In a word, the hatred of the
present <HI>Pontificate</HI> appears very visibly upon
this Occasion: the <HI>People</HI> affecting to shew a
very extraordinary rage against a person, and a
party, that has been so much favoured and sup|ported
by the <HI>Pope:</HI> so that this matter comes
clearly home to him, and wounds his Repu|tation
extreamly; all this raises the credit of the
<HI>Iesuites,</HI> who value themselves upon the zeal
and the conduct of their <HI>Society</HI> upon this Oc|casion.
All the <HI>Popes</HI> Enemies, the <HI>Iesuites,</HI>
the <HI>French Party,</HI> and the body of the <HI>People,</HI>
that are Malecontented and weary of him,
and his long and dull <HI>Reign,</HI> shew the Plea|sure
they have in aggravating this matter a|gainst
him: they say, this is the first time
that ever any <HI>Heresy</HI> made <HI>Rome</HI> its Seat,
where it choosed to nestle it self; but it is
yet more strange, that it should have conti|nued
there above twenty years, notwithstand|ing
all that multitude of <HI>Spyes</HI> that the <HI>Inqui|sition</HI>
has every where; that the <HI>Pope</HI> should
have shut his Ears against all Complaints,
so that this Doctrine had gained so great Au|thority,
that those who attackt it, passed for
<HI>Hereticks,</HI> or Calumniators at least, and that
even after all the Discoveries that have been
made, that the <HI>Pope</HI> was known to favour
<HI>Molinos</HI> secretly, and was so hardly brought at
last to consent to the Condemnation, in which
it is said, that nothing prevailed on him till
<PB N="92" REF="55">
the <HI>Cardinal's</HI> informed him of the Scandals
of <HI>Molinos</HI>'s Life, that were proved: this
was indeed a matter that could fall within the
<HI>Popes</HI> understanding; for the points of Do|ctrine
are believed to be above it. All these
things concur to increase the Contempt un|der
which the present <HI>Pontisicate</HI> lies; yet as
for those Scandals of <HI>Molinos</HI>'s life, I do not
know what to believe: many will not believe
them, and think they are only Impostures
given out to render him odious; for if they
had been true, and well proved, it is said,
that the <HI>Censure</HI> would have been severer; for
a perpetual <HI>Imprisonment,</HI> and the saying his
<HI>Credo,</HI> and the fourth part of the <HI>Rosary</HI> every
day, are mild Punishments, if he is found
to have been so flagitious a man, and so vile
a Hypocrite, as is given out. His own Be|haviour
at the <HI>Minerva</HI> did not look, either
like a Man, that was much confounded with
the Discoveries that had been made, or that
was very Penitent for them, or for his <HI>Heresy:</HI>
so that the Mildness of the <HI>Censure,</HI> to a Man
that shewed to little humility or repentance,
seems to flow rather from the Defectiveness
of the Proofs, than from the gentleness of the
<HI>Tribunal.</HI> I confess, I was not a Witness to
what passed in the <HI>Minerva;</HI> for as I would
not venture in the Crowd, so both Money
and Favour was necessary to accommodate a
man well on that occasion, where not only
<PB N="93" REF="55">
a general Curiosity brought a vast confluence
of People together, to see the issue of a Busi|ness
that has been so long in suspence, but a
particular Devotion: for the <HI>Pope</HI> had granted
a <HI>General Indulgence</HI> to all that should assist in
that Solemnity: but I will give you the ac|count
as I had it from Eye-witnesses. <HI>Moli|nos</HI>
was well dressed, new trimm'd, in his
Priestly Habit, with a cheerful Countenance,
that as was said by his Enemies, had all the
Charmes on it, that were necessary to re|commend
him to the fair Sex. He was brought
from <HI>Prison</HI> in an open Coach, one <HI>Domini|can</HI>
being with him in it. He was at first
placed for some time in one of the <HI>Corridori of
the Minerva:</HI> he looked about him very freely,
and returned all the Salutes that were made
him: and all that he was heard say, was,
<HI>That they saw a man that was defamed, but that
was Penitent (Infamato ma Pentito.)</HI> After
that he was carried to dinner, where he was
well treated, that being to be his last good
Dinner. After Dinner, he was brought into
the <HI>Church,</HI> as in a Triumph, carried on the
shoulders of the <HI>Sbiri</HI> in an open Chair: when
he was brought to his place, as he made his
Reverence very devoutly to the <HI>Cardinals,</HI> so
there was no shew of Fear or of Shame, in
his whole Deportment. He was chained, and
a Wax Light was put in his hand, while two
strong-lung'd <HI>Fryers</HI> read his <HI>Process</HI> aloud,
<PB N="94" REF="56">
and care had been taken to lay matters so, that
as some of the <HI>Articles</HI> were read, all should
cry <HI>Fire, Fire.</HI> When he came back to <HI>Prison,</HI>
he entred into his little Cell, with great
Tranquillity, calling it his <HI>Cabinet,</HI> and
took leave of his <HI>Priest</HI> in these words, <HI>Adieu
Father, we shall meet again at the Day of Iudg|ment,
and then it will appear on which side
the Truth is, whether on my side, or on yours.</HI> So
he was shut up for <HI>Life.</HI> Yet after all I find
none of the wise men here think that the
thing is at an end; but that the Fire which
seems to be now extinguished, will break
out with more violence; for one of his <HI>Fol|lowers</HI>
had the boldness to tell the <HI>Inquisitors</HI>
to their face, that they were a Company of
Unjust, Cruel, and Heretical men; and
compared their Treatment with that which
Christ had met with, and yet even he has
escaped upon an Abjuration, as is pretended.
The Reasons that are given for this extraor|dinary
Gentleness of the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI> who are
seldom accused for erring on this side, are
both the Numbers of the <HI>Party,</HI> who might
be much irritated by publick Examples, and
also the great Credit that their <HI>Doctrine</HI> has
from the <HI>Mystical Divinity,</HI> that is autho|rised
by so many <HI>Canonisations:</HI> for it is said,
that from several parts the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> have
brought together above twenty thousand of
<HI>Molino</HI>'s <HI>Letters:</HI> whose Correspondence
<PB N="95" REF="56">
was so vast, that some give out, that the
<HI>Post</HI> of the <HI>Letters,</HI> that were brought him the
day in which he was seised on, rise to twenty
Crowns. And I heard a <HI>Divine</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> con|fess,
that they have such <HI>Authorities</HI> for most of
their <HI>Tenets,</HI> that they will never be beat out
of them, by the force of their <HI>School Divinity,</HI>
therefore he thought it was necessary to con|demn
them by a formal Sentence, in which
the Authority of the Church was to be inter|posed.
Most of the condemned <HI>Articles</HI> are
nothing but an Invidious Aggravating of
the Doctrine of <HI>Predestination</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> Ef|ficacious
of it self, and of Immediat Inspira|tion:
for all the hard Consequences that are
pretended to be drawn, either from the one
or the other of these Opinions, are all turned
into so many <HI>Articles,</HI> and condemned as so
many Impious Doctrines; but you will be
better able to judge of this matter when you
see all that the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> will think sit to
print concerning it.</P>

<HEAD>A SECOND
LETTER
Writ from
ROME,
Containing some Particulars, relating
to the
INQUISITION&punc;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY last to you, together with the
<HI>Advertisement</HI> which was sent me
from <HI>Rome,</HI> related wholly to the
Affairs of the <HI>Quietists;</HI> but be|cause
I know your Curiosity will perhaps go
further, and that you expect such <HI>Observations</HI>
from me, as you fancy me capable to make,
in a <HI>Countrey</HI> where I have now made so long
a stay, that it is my own fault, if I have not
been able to see a little further than Common
<PB N="97" REF="57">
<HI>Travellers</HI> do, therefore I will try what I
can say that may please you.</P>
<P>I am, as you know, no Searcher into <HI>Manu|scripts,</HI>
or the Curiosities of <HI>Libraries,</HI> nor
can I bring my self to so dry a study as is that
of <HI>Medals,</HI> or <HI>Inscriptions.</HI> I had rather be
beholding to the Labours of others, for the
Discoveries they have made in those mat|ters,
than wear out my Eyes and spend my
Time in the reading and Deciphering those
<HI>Remains</HI> of Antiquity. I love all that know|ledg,
which, with how much difficulty soe|ver
it may be acquired, feeds the mind with
some useful Ideas: but as for that knowledg
which carrys one no further, then that such
a <HI>Word,</HI> or such a <HI>Hierogliphick</HI> signified such
a <HI>thing,</HI> and that gives the mind no matter to
work on, and raises no game at which it may
fly, it has not charm enough to work on so
lasy a man as I am. I confess, my studies, and
my way of Life would have carried me more
naturally into matters of <HI>Religion,</HI> or into
the <HI>Politicks:</HI> but as to the former, <HI>Italy</HI> is
not a Country, where a man either can or
dare reason upon these Subjects: for their
Ignorance is such, that no man can profit
much by their conversation on those heads:
besides that, it is not safe to do it. The <HI>Ita|lians</HI>
are too well bred, to attack a man on
that Argument; and they know their own
Ignorance so well, and have so high an Opi|nion
<PB N="98" REF="58">
of the <HI>Learning</HI> of the <HI>Hereticks,</HI> that they
are sure never to provoke any of them: and
he were a very bold and Indiscreet man, that
would begin the dispute with them: so after
all, <HI>Newes</HI> and <HI>Politicks</HI> is all that Remains,
and you know I am idle enough both to
think and to talk of these upon occasion: yet
I must confess, that I find so many of my
<HI>Reflections</HI> in Dr. <HI>Burnets Letters,</HI> that I have
got sent me from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> that if I had not
seen these, I had very likely writ you a great
many of those that are already set out by
him, with so much advantage, that I find the
best part of all my <HI>Observations</HI> are already
made by a better Pen: but I, who have as great
an Aversion from copying, as he says he has;
will avoid the saying any one thing that I find
in his <HI>Letters:</HI> and will only speak of those
Places that he did not see, or of those matters
which he had not time enough to enquire af|ter,
or to observe; and since the former <HI>Let|ter,</HI>
contained such a long and serious recital
of a matter, that if it fixed your attention, yet
must have wearied it, I will now divert you
a little, with some <HI>Storys,</HI> that will be more
agreeable; and then I will return to more se|rious
<HI>Subjects.</HI> I will begin with some relating
to the <HI>Inquisition.</HI> I told you in my former
<HI>Letter,</HI> of a great many <HI>Prisoners</HI> in the <HI>In|quisition,</HI>
but among all the <HI>Prisoners</HI> that are
there, none will surprise you so much as
<PB N="99" REF="58">
when I tell you that there is a <HI>Cruxifix</HI> kept
there, which is called, <HI>our Saviour in the In|quisition:</HI>
when this was first told me, I durst
not speak out that which naturally occur|red
to my thoughts, which was, that our <HI>Sa|viour</HI>
and the <HI>Truth of his Gospel,</HI> was indeed
shut up with so much severity by the <HI>Inquisi|tors,</HI>
that it was no wonder if he were recko|ned
among the <HI>Prisoners</HI> of that severe <HI>Court.</HI>
But this story is less serious, and more Comical.</P>
<P>You know that in all the bigotted <HI>Towns,</HI>
the <HI>people</HI> are sorted in several <HI>Fraternities,</HI>
and every one of these, has their peculiar
<HI>Churches, Altars, Images</HI> and <HI>Relicks,</HI> to
which they pay a more extraordinary devo|tion:
so there was one in <HI>Florence,</HI> among
whose favourite <HI>Images</HI> a <HI>Crucifix</HI> hapned to
be one: a <HI>Woman</HI> (that had a fair <HI>Daughter</HI>)
fell sick: and as she had payed many Devo|tions
to that <HI>Image,</HI> so she came to fancy,
that in her sickness she had the Returns of
very extraordinary Favours from it. The
truth of the matter was, that one who had a
mind to have frequent access to her <HI>Daugh|ter,</HI>
made a shift to deceive the poor <HI>sick
Woman:</HI> for he appeared in such a disguise
to her, that she believed it was the <HI>Image</HI>
that came to comfort her. And that which
was the most acceptable part of the Impo|sture
was, that the <HI>Impostor</HI> knew by her
<HI>Daughters</HI> means, every thing that she wan|ted,
<PB N="100" REF="59">
and took care to provide it for her,
so that at every visit that he made her, he
brought along with him, all the things that
she needed: this was sensible; so the credulous
<HI>Woman</HI> believed all this came from her be|loved
<HI>Image:</HI> and she was now as gratefull as
she had been before devout: she told all that
came to see her; how careful and bountiful
that <HI>Image</HI> was to her: and shewed them
how well she was supplied by it. In short,
this came to be generally believed: for when
the least <HI>story</HI> of this kind gets vent, and is
well received by the <HI>Priests,</HI> the <HI>People</HI> run
in so headlong to it, that it would pass for
a Crime capable enough of ruining one in the
Spirit of the <HI>Inquisitors,</HI> to seem to doubt
of it; but much more if one studied to unde|ceive
others: therefore things of this nature
kindle the minds of a superstitious multitude
so quick, that in a few days a whole <HI>Town</HI>
will seem as it was out of its Wits: which
appeared signally on this occasion at <HI>Florence:</HI>
for now the whole <HI>Town</HI> entred into this <HI>Fra|ternity.</HI>
The <HI>Great Duke</HI> himself came into
the number, and all were studying what new
Honours should be done to an <HI>Image</HI> that had
been so kind to one of its <HI>Worshippers.</HI> But some
that were wiser than the rest, saw thro the
Cheat, and Informed <HI>P. Innocent</HI> the <HI>10th.</HI> of
it, who was resolved to put a stop to the cur|rent
of this <HI>Superstition:</HI> yet he saw it was ne|cessary
<PB N="101" REF="59">
to do it with some address: It fell out
to be the year of <HI>Iubily</HI> 1650. so the <HI>Pope</HI> writ
to <HI>Florence,</HI> that he had heard of the <HI>Miracles</HI>
of that <HI>Image,</HI> to which he desired earnestly to
do his own <HI>Devotions,</HI> therfore he intreated
them to bring it to <HI>Rome;</HI> that so the <HI>Image</HI>
might have the addresses of all the <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> as
well as his own made to it. Upon this the
more bigotted of the <HI>Fraternity,</HI> would needs
accompany the Charitable <HI>Image:</HI> so they
carried it in <HI>Procession</HI> to <HI>Rome:</HI> and did not
doubt but that the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Cardinalls</HI> with
the <HI>Clergy</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> would have come out in <HI>Pro|cession</HI>
to meet them and their <HI>Image:</HI> The sur|prise
was no doubt very great, when instead of
all this, they found a Company of <HI>Sbirri</HI> stay|ing
for them at the <HI>Porta dell Populo;</HI> who
took their <HI>Image</HI> from them, and carried it
away to the <HI>Inquisition;</HI> and sent them away
not a little mortified at the Disgrace, that
had befallen their <HI>Crucifix,</HI> who has been
ever since a <HI>Prisoner</HI> in the <HI>Inquisition.</HI></P>
<P>I was told of another <HI>Prisoner</HI> there of a
later date, but not much unlike this. You
know the legend of the <HI>Plague</HI> that was in
<HI>Rome,</HI> as I remember in S. <HI>Gregory the great's</HI>
time, that was stopt by an <HI>Angel,</HI> that as was
pretended came down, and stood over that
<HI>Castle,</HI> which was formerly called <HI>Moles Ha|driani,</HI>
but has carried the name of <HI>Castro S.
Angelo</HI> ever since. The <HI>Fryers</HI> of <HI>Ara Coeli</HI> had
<PB N="102" REF="60">
got a <HI>Stone,</HI> upon which there was an Im|pression
like the print of a <HI>Foot:</HI> so they had
put this in some part of their <HI>Church,</HI> and
gave it out that this print was made by the
<HI>Foot</HI> of that <HI>Angel;</HI> tho one can <HI>hardly</HI> Ima|gine
how they fancied that an <HI>Angel</HI> treads so
hard. This <HI>Stone</HI> had many <HI>Devotions</HI> payed
it. The learned Sig^r^. <HI>Pietro Bellori,</HI> who is
without dispute the best <HI>Antiquary</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI>
being once in that <HI>Chappel</HI> at his Devotions;
observed a great many praying about this
<HI>Stone,</HI> and kissing it with great Respect and
Affection; so he came to look upon it, and
having examined it carefully, he saw clear|ly
it was a fragment of a Statue of the Goddess
<HI>Isis;</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Characters were legible, and
many things concurred to make a man of his
Learning and Exactness conclude, that the
<HI>Devotions</HI> were mis-applied that were payed
it; so he went to one of the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the
<HI>House,</HI> and acquainted him with his Observa|tion:
and wished that they would remove
that mistaken Object of Worship, lest some
of the learned <HI>Hereticks</HI> that passed thro <HI>Rome,</HI>
might discover and reproach the <HI>Church</HI> with
it. But the <HI>Fathers</HI> of the <HI>House</HI> found their
account in this matter, so they were so far
from following his good Advice, that they
aspersed him that had given it, so as to accuse
him of Impiety for diverting the Devotions
of the people: the Imputation was carried so
<PB N="103" REF="60">
far that he was brought before the <HI>Inquisition</HI>
to clear himself, which he did so fully, that
he not only got safe out of their hands, but
which was more, he convinced them that he
was in the right: so the <HI>Stone</HI> was removed,
and keeps the <HI>Crucifix</HI> company in the <HI>Inqui|sition.</HI></P>
<P>But by these two Storys, you will perhaps
imagin that I design to beget in you a good
Opinion of that <HI>Court;</HI> but I will now tell
you another, that will soon bring you back
to your old thoughts of that Tribunal. <HI>Burrhi</HI>
is a man so famous in the World, that one
that has looked into Natural <HI>Philosophy</HI> and
<HI>Chimistry,</HI> could not be long in <HI>Rome</HI> with|out
making an acquaintance with him: but
to tell you truth, I neither found him to
be so great a <HI>Chimist</HI> as he fancies himself to
be, nor so great a <HI>Heretick</HI> as the <HI>Inquisitors</HI>
have made him. I tell you this the more par|ticularly,
that you may upon it judge how
far you are to believe the account that the
<HI>Inquisitors</HI> may give of their proceedings a|gainst
<HI>Molinos:</HI> since you may conclude from
what was done to the <HI>one,</HI> what may be ex|pected
in all cases that are brought before
them. <HI>Burrhi</HI>'s Story is in short this; He is a
Gentleman of the <HI>Millanese,</HI> who was born
to an Estate of 8000. <HI>Crowns</HI> a year: In his
youth he had travelled, and had got into his
head the Notions of the <HI>Now Philosophy</HI> and
<PB N="104" REF="61">
of <HI>Chimistry:</HI> so at his return to <HI>Milan,</HI> he
began to propogate the <HI>new Philosophy,</HI> and
to form a Conference upon those matters:
the <HI>Priests</HI> it seems suspected, that there might
be somewhat under this, so he was put in
the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> but nothing could be made
out against him, he was let out: after that
he went and stayd for some years in <HI>Germany</HI>
and <HI>Holland;</HI> and it is very probable that he
might have expressed himself concerning the
<HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Inquisition,</HI> as a man that had no
great opinion either of their Justice, or of
their Mercy. And as he has gone into all the
high pretensions of the <HI>Chimists,</HI> so it is pro|bable
enough that he has talked of matters
of <HI>Religion</HI> in that Mysterious unintelligible
<HI>Iargon,</HI> that is used almost by all the men
that are of the highest Elevation of <HI>Chimistry,</HI>
but chiefly by <HI>Paracelsus</HI> and <HI>Van Helmont.</HI>
In short, some Accusations were given in to
the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> against him, who complained
of him to the <HI>Emperour,</HI> and had so much cre|dit
in his <HI>Court</HI> that he strained his power to
the utmost, and seised on him, and sent him
to <HI>Italy,</HI> where those good <HI>Fathers</HI> were re|solved
not to give him a second occasion of
boasting, that he had got safe out of their
hands: strange things were objected to him;
and as is pretended, they were proved against
him; as that the <HI>B. Virgin was God equal with
the Son; and that the H. Ghost was incarnate in
<PB N="105" REF="61">
her, as well as the Eternal Word was in her
Son: that the three Persons in the Trinity were
the</HI> first, <HI>the</HI> second, <HI>and the</HI> third <HI>Heavens:
that the Son was from all Eternity discontented
with the Father, for not making him equal to
him: that the Consecrated Hosty had in it the
Body of the Mother as well as that of the Son:
and that the putting the pieces of it together in
the Chalice, demonstrated the Vnion between
the Mother and the Son.</HI> These Opinions were
all proved against him: tho he protests that
he never thought of them, yet he was forced
to abjure them in the year 1668. and was up|on
that condemned to perpetual Imprison|ment;
he continued in the Prison of the <HI>In|quisition,</HI>
till within these five or six years,
that the Duke <HI>d'Estrees</HI> being sick, procured
an Order for having <HI>Burrhi</HI> to come and treat
him; and in gratitude to <HI>Burrhi,</HI> who cured
him, he got his Prison changed to the Castle
St. <HI>Angelo:</HI> where he now entertains himself
with <HI>Chimical</HI> Processes. It is indeed very
probable, that he had provoked the <HI>Inquisition,</HI>
by speaking severely and reproachfully of
them, and this was all his Crime, unless an|other
<HI>Article</HI> against him might be his <HI>Estate;</HI>
for of his 8000. <HI>Crowns</HI> a year, there is but
3000. left him; for the good <HI>Fathers</HI> have
had the Charity to take 5000. to themselves:
and his 3000. is so eat up by them, thro whose
hands it comes to him, that he has not 1500:
<PB N="106" REF="62">
<HI>Crowns</HI> a year payed him: and from this you
may see what credit you ought to give to the
<HI>Processes,</HI> the <HI>Articles,</HI> and the <HI>Abjurations</HI>
that are made before that <HI>Court.</HI></P>
<P>If instead of that Zeal which animates
them against <HI>Heresy,</HI> they would purge their
own <HI>Church</HI> of those Disorders, which they
themselves acknowledg to be corruptions,
they would sooner bring themselves again in|to
credit. The scandalous <HI>Pictures</HI> that are in
many <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> are things that might
deserve their care, if they would turn it to
that hand. Is it not a shameful thing, that
there has not been a great <HI>Master</HI> in <HI>Painting</HI>
who has not put that Complement on his
<HI>Mistress,</HI> as to paint her for the <HI>Virgin?</HI> so
that the most celebrated <HI>Madonna's</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI>
are known to have been the <HI>Mistresses</HI> of the
Great <HI>Painters.</HI> The <HI>Postures,</HI> the <HI>Looks,</HI> and
the <HI>Nakedness</HI> of many of the <HI>Church-pieces,</HI>
are Monstrous Indecent things. The great
design of the <HI>Cupulo</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> is such a Re|presentation
of <HI>Vice,</HI> that all that can be pre|sented
by a defiled Imagination, comes short
of what is to be seen there: and tho the <HI>Scrip|ture</HI>
speaks but of one Apparition of the <HI>Holy
Ghost</HI> in the shape of a <HI>Dove;</HI> one shall find
this Dove on the Head, at the Ear, and the
Mouth of I know not how many of their
<HI>Saints;</HI> and as one finds in many <HI>Pieces,</HI> that
their <HI>Masters</HI> have resolved to perpetuate
<PB N="107" REF="62">
their own Amours in them, so Amours are
every day managed by the same methods: for
while I was at <HI>Rome,</HI> I discovered an Intrigue
between a <HI>Fryer</HI> and a <HI>Nun,</HI> by two <HI>Pictures,</HI>
that were drawn for them: the <HI>Fryer</HI> was
drawn as a S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> and the <HI>Nun</HI> as a S.
<HI>Katherine of Siena:</HI> these they were to ex|change,
and so to feed their passion under this
disguise of Devotion.</P>
<P>But to return to Indecent <HI>Pictures,</HI> there
is nothing more scandalous, than the many
various Representations of the <HI>Trinity,</HI> which
must needs give to all <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI>
as well as to <HI>us,</HI> that pass for <HI>Hereticks,</HI> a
strange horror to a <HI>Religion</HI> that suffers those
odious Resemblances, that give such gross
Ideas of the <HI>Deity,</HI> and of the <HI>Trinity:</HI> and
that which is yet the most scandalous part of
those <HI>Pictures,</HI> is that the Representation of
<HI>God the Father</HI> is often diversified according to
the caprice of the Painter; and he is to be seen
in the Habits of the several <HI>Orders</HI> of that
<HI>Church,</HI> and indeed both Features, Hair, Ha|bit,
and Postures, have all the diversity in
them that is necessary to feed an <HI>Idolatry,</HI> that
is as Extravagant as it is gross.</P>
<P>The Picture of the B. <HI>Virgin,</HI> with the <HI>Or|der</HI>
of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> under her Petticoat, is
not very apt to raise Chast Idea's in those who
look upon it. In short, whereas the Rule of
the Antient <HI>Architecture</HI> of <HI>Churches,</HI> was to
<PB N="108" REF="63">
below and dark, which was thought the most
proper, for the Recollection of a man's Fa|culties,
and by consequence for <HI>Devotion,</HI> is
now quite altered: and great <HI>Cupulos</HI> with a
vast Illumination, are necessary to shew the
Beauty of those rich Pieces, which would be
lost in <HI>Churches</HI> built as dark as the Antient
Ones were.</P>
<P>I confess, those Pictures are charming
things, if they were any where else than in
<HI>Churches:</HI> but the pleasure they give, does so
possess a man that begins to understand them,
that it will kindle any thoughts in him, sooner
than devout ones. I will not here let my
Pen carry me into a Subject that must needs
set all my thoughts on fire; and speak of the
great <HI>Pieces</HI> of <HI>Painting</HI> that are in <HI>Italy,</HI> and
of the many <HI>Masters</HI> that it produced in the
last Age: who as they were such Extraordi|nary
men, so they lived within the Compass of
one Age; as if the Perfection in that amasing
Art had been to dye with them, as well as it
was born with them; this, I say, would make
one think, that there are Revolutions and
Aspects in the Heavens that are favorable or
cross to Arts or Sciences: and that then, the
most favourable Aspect for <HI>Painting</HI> that ever
was, produced those astonishing perfor|mances.
For tho the great decay of Learning
that is every where, may be reasonably e|nough
resolved in this, that whereas in the
<PB N="109" REF="63">
last <HI>Age</HI> many great <HI>Princes</HI> were either <HI>Learn|ed</HI>
themselves, or at least they made it a
Maxim to protect and encourage <HI>Learning;</HI>
but this having at last grown to an excess of
Rudeness and Pedantry, and Princes beco|ming
generally extream Ignorant, it came to
pass for a piece of breeding, to say nothing that
was beyond their pitch, or that seemed to
reproach their Ignorance: and those who
could not hide their Learning, were called
<HI>Pedants:</HI> and pedantry was represented so
odious, that Ignorance being the lasiest as
well as the surest way to avoid this, all men
took that very naturally; and when other
methods are as effectual to raise men to the
highest preferments either of the <HI>Barr</HI> or of
the <HI>Pulpit</HI> as true Learning or reall Merit,
few will choose the long and tedious, and often
the most uncertain way, when the End that
they propose to themselves, may be cer|tainly
compassed by a more effectual and ea|sier
one. Flattery and Submissions are sooner
Learned and easier practised by men of low
and mean souls, than much hard and dry
study: thus, I say, the decay of <HI>Learning</HI> is
very easily accounted for, in the <HI>Age</HI> in which
we live: but as for the Art of <HI>Painting,</HI> it
is still in such esteem, and great pieces go
still at such vast rates, that if the Genius
and capacity for it were not lost, there is
encouragment enough still to set it a going:
<PB N="110" REF="64">
but I leave this subject not without putting
some constraint on my self; for who can think
of such Wonderful men as <HI>Correge, Michael
Angelo, Raphael, Paulo Veronese, Iulio Ro|mano,
Carrache, Palma, Titian</HI> and <HI>Tintoret,</HI>
without feeling a concern at every time that
he reflects on the Wonders of their pencils:
St. <HI>Lukes</HI> pretended work, and even the sup|posed
performances of <HI>Angels,</HI> are sad things
set near their <HI>pieces.</HI> One, whose thoughts are
full of the Wonders of that <HI>Art,</HI> that are to
be seen in <HI>Florence,</HI> goes into the <HI>Annunciata,</HI>
and sees not without Indignation, that ado|red
<HI>picture</HI> of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> which, as the fond
people there believe, was finished by an <HI>An|gel,</HI>
while the <HI>Painter</HI> that was working at it,
and that could not animate it as he desired,
fell asleep, who as soon as he awaked, saw
his piece finished. This fiction of the <HI>painters,</HI>
to raise the credit of his <HI>picture,</HI> is so well be|lieved
at <HI>Florence,</HI> that he <HI>presents</HI> made to
enrich the <HI>Altar</HI> and <HI>Chappel,</HI> where it stands,
are Invaluable: &amp; yet after all, the <HI>Angel's</HI> work
is still no better than the common <HI>painting</HI> of
that time: and that <HI>Angel-painter,</HI> was but a
bungler if compared, to the great <HI>Masters.</HI> In
a word, what can be thought of humane na|ture,
when in so refined a place as <HI>Florence,</HI>
so course an Imposture has been able to
draw to it, such an Inestimable stock of
Wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="64">
All these things are so many digressions
from my main subject, which was, to shew
you how much matter the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> might
find, if they would use any exactness in redres|sing
those Abuses which they themselves will
not defend in common conversation: and yet
tho the smallest thing, that seems even at the
greatest distance to go against their Interest,
is lookt after with a very watchful care; yet
the grossest of all Impostures, that proves
profitable to them, is much encouraged by
them.</P>
<P>The fable of <HI>Loretto,</HI> is so black and so ri|diculous
a piece of Imposture, that I never
saw a man of sense, that cared to enter upon
that subject. I was once in Company where
I took the liberty to propose two modest
Exceptions to it: the one was, that about
200 <HI>years</HI> after the rest of the Angelical La|bour
in carying about that <HI>Cottage</HI> is preten|ded
to have fallen out, <HI>Vincent Ferrrier,</HI>
whom they believe a great Saint, not only
sayes nothing of its being then in <HI>Italy,</HI> but
sayes expresly, that it was then in <HI>Nazareth,</HI> &amp;
that many <HI>Miracles</HI> were wrought about it.
<HI>Antonin</HI> of <HI>Florence;</HI> who is also the most Im|pudent
Writer of <HI>Legends</HI> that ever was, say's
not a word of it some Ages after they say that
it was at <HI>Loretto.</HI> All the answer that I had
to this was, that it was no Article of Faith,
but whether it was true or false, the Devo|tion
<PB N="112" REF="65">
of the People was still entertained by it:
and this, they said, was as much meritorious,
tho founded on a Fable, as the giving of Cha|rity
to one who is believed a fit object, but yet
is indeed a Cheat, is acceptable to God: and
thus he who gives upon a good inward motive,
will be rewarded according to the Dispo|sition
of his Mind, and not according to the
Truth or Falsehood of the <HI>Story,</HI> that wrought
upon him. I durst not press this matter too
far: otherwise I would have replied, that
how excuseable soever the Superstition of
Ignorant <HI>People</HI> may be, yet this does not at
all justify the Cheat that the <HI>Church</HI> puts upon
her so easily deluded children. The truth is,
the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves have not such stiff
notions of all the points of <HI>Controversy</HI> as we
are apt to Imagine: this makes me remember
a conversation that past some years ago, be|tween
an <HI>Abbot</HI> &amp; one of our <HI>Clergymen,</HI> that
was then a Governour to a <HI>Person</HI> of Quality,
that in his <HI>Travels</HI> stayed for some time at
<HI>Rome.</HI> The <HI>Abbot</HI> seeing the <HI>Governour</HI> was con|sidered
as a man of <HI>Learning,</HI> desired to be In|formed
of him, what were the <HI>Points</HI> in diffe|rence
between the <HI>two</HI> Churches: so the Go|vernour
told him, that <HI>we</HI> had our <HI>worship</HI>
in a known tongue; that we gave the <HI>Cup</HI> in
the Sacrament; that we had no <HI>Images,</HI> and
did not pray to <HI>Saints:</HI> all this did not disturb
the <HI>Abbot,</HI> who said, that these were only
<PB N="113" REF="65">
different <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> which might
be well enough born with: when the other
added, that we did not believe <HI>Transubstan|tiation</HI>
nor <HI>Purgatory,</HI> the <HI>Abbot</HI> said, these
were the subtilties of the School: so he was
very gentle till the <HI>Governour</HI> told him, that
we did not acknowledge the <HI>Pope;</HI> then the
<HI>Abbot</HI> was all on fire, and could not compre|hend,
how men could be <HI>Christians,</HI> that did
not acknowledge Christs <HI>Vicar,</HI> and S. <HI>Peter's
Successor:</HI> and it is very plain at <HI>Rome</HI> at this
day, that they consider the <HI>Conversion</HI> of <HI>Na|tions,</HI>
only as it may bring in more profit into
the <HI>Datary Court,</HI> and raise the value of the <HI>Offi|ces</HI>
there; for when I seemed amased in con|versation
with some of them, to see so little
regard had to the <HI>Ambassadour</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> and
to every thing that he proposed; they told me
plainly, that perhaps the Angels in Heaven re|joiced
at the conversion of a sinner upon the
pure motives of perfect Charity, but they at
<HI>Rome</HI> looked at other things. They saw no
<HI>profit</HI> like to come from <HI>England;</HI> no <HI>Bulls</HI>
were called for, and no <HI>Compositions</HI> like to be
made; if those things should once appear, then
an <HI>Ambassadour</HI> from thence would be treated
like the penitent Prodigal, especially if he
were a little less governed by the <HI>Iesuites,</HI>
who were believed to have managed our <HI>Am|bassadour</HI>
a little too absolutely: and here it
will be no unpleasant digression if I tell you
<PB N="114" REF="66">
the true reason that retarded the <HI>Promotion</HI> of
the Cardinal <HI>d'Est&eacute;</HI> so long.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pope</HI> himself saw what the <HI>Vncle</HI> of this
<HI>Cardinal</HI> did at <HI>Rome,</HI> in P. <HI>Alexander</HI> the
<HI>7ths</HI> time, upon the business of the <HI>Corsis,</HI> and
the affront that was put on the Duke of <HI>Crequy,</HI>
which made so much noise. That <HI>Cardinal</HI>
being then the <HI>Protector</HI> of the <HI>French Nation,</HI>
offered first to the D. of <HI>Crequy,</HI> to go with
him, accompanied with 500 Men, that he
knew he could raise in <HI>Rome,</HI> to the Palace of
<HI>Dom Mario Chigi,</HI> and to fling him out at
window: but the D. of <HI>Crequy</HI> thinking that
such a revenge went too far, the <HI>Cardinal</HI>
himself went accompanied with his 500 Men
to the <HI>Palace,</HI> and expostulated the matter
with the <HI>Pope,</HI> and demanded Reparation; and
when the <HI>Pope</HI> put it by in some general an|swers,
he prest him so hard, till the <HI>Pope</HI> threat|ned
to pull his <HI>Cap</HI> from him, but he answered,
<HI>that he would clap a Head-piece on it, to defend
it, and that he would never part with that, till
he had pulled the Tripple Crown from his head:</HI>
This was vigorous, and the <HI>Cardinal</HI> had a
mind to perpetuate the memory of it, for he
made himself be drawn with a <HI>Headpiece</HI> by
him, his hand pointing towards it, which I saw
at <HI>Modena;</HI> and it is plain by their way of spea|king
of this matter, that they were proud of it.
The present <HI>Pope</HI> being at that time a <HI>Cardinal,</HI>
saw this disorder, and so he was resolved never
<PB N="115" REF="66">
to raise one of that <HI>family</HI> to the <HI>Purple:</HI> yet the
earnest and repeated Instances from <HI>England,</HI>
overcame him at last.</P>
<P>But now again I return to that from which I
have digressed so often, which is the work that
the <HI>Inquisition</HI> might find in <HI>Italy,</HI> even with|out
departing from any of their received Prin|ciples.
That scandalous Imposture of the <HI>blood</HI>
of S. <HI>Ianuary</HI> at <HI>Naples,</HI> that seems to be firm &amp;
dry in the <HI>Vial,</HI> and that dissolves and moves
as it is brought near his Head, which is so firmly
believed by all the bigots there, must needs give
an Indignation to all that love Truth, when
they see such gross Deceptions put upon the
World. I will not take upon me to say how
it is managed; but nothing is more easy than
the ordering of this matter may be. For if that
<HI>Vial</HI> be filled with tinctured liquor, the <HI>Vial</HI>
being put in Ice and Salt, will freese in an In|stant;
and it being again in the air, may return
very quickly to its former state, so that there
is no need of any great skill for the conducting
this matter: and it is so much their Interest,
who have the keeping of this pretended <HI>Blood,</HI>
to keep the secret very religiously, that it is
no wonder if it is not discovered. He indeed
who either doubts of it, or would adventure
to discover it, must resolve to go and live some
were else than in <HI>Naples,</HI> where this passes for
the chief Glory, as well as the greatest bles|sing
of their <HI>City:</HI> and the <HI>people</HI> there are so
<PB N="116" REF="67">
extreamly credulous, &amp; the <HI>Priests</HI> are so very
Insolent, that this has appeared of late in such
Instances, that if the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> were
not both a very extraordinary man, and most
excessively esteemed and beloved there, he
could not have stood his ground in the <HI>Dispute</HI>
which is now on foot, and of which tho all the
<HI>Gazettes</HI> make mention, yet I may perhaps
tell you some particulars, that may be new to
you, for I was in <HI>Naples</HI> while this matter was
in its greatest heat.</P>
<P>The business of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Immunities,</HI>
is carried so high here, that the <HI>General</HI> of the
<HI>Horse,</HI> who is by birth a <HI>Flemming,</HI> had almost
felt it to his cost; there were two under him,
that had quarrelled, but were made Friends;
and one of these meeting the other some days
after that, he embraced him with all the shewes
of Friendship, but having a <HI>stiletto</HI> in his hand,
he managed it so fatally, that under all the ap|pearences
of tender Embraces, he killed him
out-right, and presently he took Sanctuary in
a <HI>Church,</HI> that was hard by; the <HI>General</HI> hear|ing
of this, resolved he would make an Exam|ple
of the <HI>Murderer:</HI> but not daring to drag
him out of the <HI>Church,</HI> he set a Sentinel to the
Doors, reckoning that hunger would soon
force him to come out: and tho the <HI>Priests</HI>
that belonged to the <HI>Church,</HI> carried him in
some Provisions, yet that could not serve him
long. But the General was forced to discharge
<PB N="117" REF="67">
the <HI>Sentinels:</HI> for he was Informed, that an
<HI>Excommunication</HI> was coming out against
him, for distrurbing the devotions of those
that went to the <HI>Church:</HI> and he knew that if
the <HI>Excommunication</HI> should be once given
out, no body would so much as talk with him
or come near him after that: so he would not
run that risque: and this <HI>Assassinate</HI> had a fair
occasion given him to make his escape: this
was a good Essay of the Zeal for the <HI>Immunity</HI>
of <HI>places.</HI> Another fell out about the same time
near <HI>Leghorn,</HI> in which the sacredness of ex|empted
<HI>persons</HI> was asserted in a manner that
was no less scandalous; a <HI>Priest</HI> was seised on,
for a most horrid Crime, either a <HI>Rape or</HI> a
<HI>Murder,</HI> I do not remember which: but he
who had no mind to be taken, defended him|self;
and shot one of the <HI>Sbiri,</HI> upon which the
rest run away. So he apprehending that a
stronger party would be sent, that would be
too hard for him, went and retired into a
Wood, with his Fusee; and some being sent
to find him out, he had <HI>shot</HI> six or seven of
them; yet after all the sacred Character was
like to save this execrable man; for while I
was at <HI>Leghorn</HI> I was told that an <HI>Excommuni|cation</HI>
was coming out, against all that should
violate the <HI>Ecclesiastical Immunities</HI> in his
Person: and no doubt the <HI>Great Duke</HI> will
give way to this: for he is so entirely deli|vered
up to his <HI>Priests,</HI> and is become so
<PB N="118" REF="68">
excessively scrupulous, that to deliver himself
from those Troubles of Conscience, which
many things, in the Administration of the <HI>Go|vernment</HI>
are apt to give him, he has found out
an easy receipt, which if all other <HI>Princes</HI> can
be brought to follow, it will be very happy for
their <HI>Ministers.</HI> He then considers, that the only
sure way to be Innocent in the Conduct of Af|fairs,
is not to know them at all: but to devolve
them entirely on his <HI>Ministers,</HI> who do all, with|out
so much as communicating matters to him.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Viceroy</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> is not so very tra|ctable
in those matters, as appears by the vi|gour
with which he has supported the <HI>secular
Tribunal</HI> against the Invasions of the <HI>Ecclesia|stical
Court.</HI> That which gave the rise to the
dispute, was, a <HI>sute</HI> that was between a <HI>Lay+man</HI>
and a <HI>Church-man,</HI> before one of the
<HI>Iudges</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> who decided in favour of
the <HI>Layman;</HI> upon which it was pretended,
that this was a Violation of the <HI>Immunities</HI> of
the <HI>Church:</HI> so the <HI>Iudge</HI> was <HI>Excommunicated;</HI>
And upon it no body would willingly appear
before him, or so much as speak to him, so ter|rible
a thing is that Thunder there: but the
<HI>Viceroy</HI> has shewed on this occasion, that firm|ness
that has appeared in all his other Actions:
and has also received <HI>Orders</HI> from <HI>Spain</HI> autho|rising
him to keep his ground. The <HI>Iudge</HI> is
not only maintained in what he has done, but
continues still to sit on the <HI>bench,</HI> all people are
<PB N="119" REF="68">
forced to bring their causes before him; &amp; his
Sentences are executed with resolution. This
Contempt put on the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Censures
by a <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and at a time in which
the <HI>Pope</HI> is so much in their <HI>Interests,</HI> is a little
Extraordinary. But the affront that the <HI>Vice|roy</HI>
put on an <HI>Auditor</HI> of the <HI>Nuntio's,</HI> was
yet much more provoking, for it was managed
with a particular care to make the Scorn very
wounding as well as it was publick. The <HI>Nun|tio</HI>
is believed to do ill Offices in this matter;
and his <HI>Auditor</HI> was known to be a man of <HI>Li|berties;</HI>
it was found out that he went often to
a <HI>Bordello;</HI> the <HI>Viceroy</HI> therefore gave order to
watch him so carefully, that the <HI>Sbiri</HI> should
be sure to find him in such circumstances, as
should make his shame very Conspicuous: so
he was taken, and carried before the next
<HI>Iudge:</HI> the thing was laid before hand, and the
<HI>Iudge</HI> refusing to medle in it, the <HI>Sbiri</HI> (a sort
of men like our <HI>Bailiffs</HI>) carried him to ano|ther,
and so made the round of all the <HI>Iudges</HI>
in <HI>Naples;</HI> and every one of them refusing to
medle with the <HI>Auditor,</HI> the <HI>Sbiri</HI> let him go,
when the matter was made sufficiently pu|blick,
by their carrying him about to so man|ny
places. The <HI>Nuntio</HI> complained of the Vio|lation
of the Rights of a <HI>Publick Minister,</HI> e|specially
of so sacred a one. But the Reparation
that the <HI>Viceroy</HI> made, was a redoubling of
the Affront: for he ordered the <HI>Sbiri</HI> that had
<PB N="120" REF="69">
taken the <HI>Auditor,</HI> to be carried about all
<HI>Naples</HI> with an <HI>Inscription</HI> writ in Capital
Letters, both on their Breasts and on their
Backs, mentioning the Crime for which
they were thus led about, <HI>which was their
having disturbed the Nuntio's Auditor in his
pleasures.</HI></P>
<P>You will easily imagin that this was consi|dered
at <HI>Rome</HI> as a most outrageous Affront;
and indeed the <HI>Pope</HI> has carried the matter of
the <HI>Regale</HI> in <HI>France</HI> so very far, that it is hard
to tell to what a degree this breach in <HI>Naples</HI>
may be also carried: for tho the <HI>Pope</HI> is most
excessively ignorant in all those Matters, yet
he has another Quality, that is the only thing
that is great in him, and that would indeed
become him very well, if he had a little more
Knowledg to govern it: and that is, <HI>that he
is the wilfullest man alive;</HI> and his temper is
fearless enough to make him shut his Eyes
upon all Danger.</P>
<P>It cannot be denied, but it is the Interest
of the <HI>Pope,</HI> as he is a <HI>Temporal Prince,</HI> to be
of the side that is now the weakest; and that
needs his support the most: and therefore it
is no wonder if he is so favourable to the
Crown of <HI>Spain,</HI> and the House of <HI>Austria:</HI>
but after all, his carrying the business of the
<HI>Regale</HI> so far, against so great a <HI>King,</HI> and
a <HI>King</HI> that has merited so much from that
<HI>Church,</HI> by his zeal against <HI>Hereticks,</HI> is
<PB N="121" REF="69">
somewhat unaccountable: After all the Ha|vock,
that has been made both by <HI>Princes</HI>
and <HI>Popes</HI> of the true Liberties of the <HI>Church,</HI>
and particularly after that shameful Bargain
that was made between them in the <HI>Concor|date,</HI>
it has a very ill grace to see a <HI>Pope</HI> make
this the subject of so great and so long a Di|spute;
and that the factious Clamours of a
few ill-natured and angry <HI>Priests,</HI> should
have been so much considered, as to inter|rupt
the good understanding of the <HI>Courts</HI> of
the <HI>Vatican</HI> and <HI>Versailles.</HI> All this flowed
from the ill opinion that the <HI>Pope</HI> had of the
<HI>Iesuites,</HI> which being known in <HI>France,</HI> the
<HI>Iansenists</HI> thought it was high time for them
to recommend themselves to the <HI>Court</HI> of
<HI>Rome,</HI> in hope of mortifying the <HI>Iesuites:</HI>
yet they could not with any decency carry
the <HI>Papal Authority</HI> high, after they had
with so much force both of reason and lear|ning,
depressed it as they had done: so they
betook themselves to the first thing that of|fered
it self, that they knew would be very
acceptable in <HI>Rome,</HI> which was the asserting
the <HI>Liberties</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and the dispu|ting
the <HI>Kings</HI> Imposing the <HI>Rights</HI> of the
<HI>Regale</HI> (that is, the mean profits of <HI>Bishopricks,</HI>
and the <HI>Collating</HI> to <HI>Benefices</HI> without <HI>Cure,</HI>
during the Vacancy) on the four southern
<HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> I will not say more of
a matter that is so well known, only I will tell
<PB N="122" REF="70">
you, what a <HI>Doctor</HI> of the <HI>Sorbon</HI> said to me
upon this subject; I found he did not believe
the <HI>Pope's Authority</HI> more than I did my self;
and yet he was one of those that indirectly op|posed
the <HI>Articles</HI> of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the con|demnation
that was past on the Bishop of
<HI>Strigonium</HI>'s Censure of those <HI>Articles;</HI> for
his Authority and Learning gave a great turn
to that matter: so when I seemed amased at
this, that a man of his Principles, had acted
as he had done upon that occasion, he told me,
he had no other Consideration before him in
that matter, but to mortify the <HI>Clergy</HI> of
<HI>France,</HI> and to maintain the Dignity of the
<HI>Sorbon.</HI> It was not long since that in the Di|spute
about <HI>Iansenius's</HI> matter, they had
made the <HI>Pope</HI> not only <HI>Infallible</HI> in matters
of <HI>Right,</HI> but of <HI>Fact:</HI> and now because the
<HI>Pope</HI> was not in the Interests of <HI>France,</HI> the
dispute of <HI>Infallibility,</HI> and of the Councils
of <HI>Constance</HI> and <HI>Basil,</HI> were again set on foot;
all which would be given up, and the <HI>Pope</HI>
would be considered <HI>Infallible</HI> to morrow, if
he were once more in the Interests of <HI>France;</HI> &amp;
the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who had neither learning nor vertue,
but made up all Defects, by a slavish Obsequi|ousness,
would be then as forward to magnify
the <HI>Infallibility,</HI> as they are now to depress it.</P>
<P>How far the <HI>Pope</HI> will embroil himself in
this new business of the <HI>Franchises,</HI> I do not
know: he has expressed a great steadiness in
<PB N="123" REF="70">
it; and the truth is, <HI>Rome</HI> is now so sunk
from what it was, and the <HI>Franchises</HI> are so
considerable a part of the City, that their
being covered from the <HI>Execution,</HI> both of
Civil and Criminal <HI>Iustice,</HI> is a most horrible
Disorder: and it seems reasonable enough,
that as in all other Courts, there is nothing
now under the <HI>Ambassadours</HI> Protection, but
that which is within his Gates, so the same
Regulation should be made in <HI>Rome;</HI> where
the extent of those priviledged Places is very
great: yet afterall, if the <HI>French Ambassadour,</HI>
that is now on his way thither, has positive
Orders to maintain them, and has mony e|nough
to list men, if the matter goes on to a
more obstinate Dispute; It will be no hard
matter for him to raise such a Revolt in <HI>Rome,</HI>
that neither the <HI>Popes Guards,</HI> nor those in the
Castle of St. <HI>Angelo,</HI> will be able to subdue
it: and if this matter goes on so far, the
<HI>French</HI> will very probably cut off all <HI>Annates,</HI>
and find a shorter way of granting of <HI>Bulls</HI>
within the <HI>Kingdom.</HI> It is said, that while some
have represented the apparent Inconveniences
of a Rupture with <HI>France</HI> to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and
that he was in no condition to resist that migh|ty
Power: He answered, <HI>that he would suf|fer
Martyrdom in maintaining the Rights of</HI>
St. <HI>Peter.</HI> It must be confessed, that there
was something in this saying that was
more Magnanimous, than prudent. And in|deed
<PB N="124" REF="71">
the <HI>Popes</HI> way of treating with <HI>Am|bassadours,</HI>
has somewhat in it that comes
neerer the simplicity of the Fishermen, the
more modern Politicks. His dry Answer to
our <HI>Ambassadour,</HI> when he threatned him
that he would leave <HI>Rome,</HI> and go back to
<HI>England,</HI> if he were not better used; <HI>Lei e
Badrone; You are Master of that as you please;</HI>
had an air in it that I should have been much
pleased with, if it had fallen on any other than
on the <HI>King's Minister.</HI></P>
<P>His Conduct of the <HI>Revenue</HI> is an unac|countable
thing; for if there is not a vast
<HI>Treasure</HI> laid up, or a most prodigious deal of
<HI>Wealth</HI> secretly conveyed to his <HI>Family,</HI> it is
not to be imagined what has become of all
that <HI>Revenue</HI> that he has raised, in which the
Income is so vastly disproportioned to the ex|pence,
that the most prying men do not know
what is become of it. The War with the
<HI>Turks</HI> has not cost him so much as is believed;
on the contrary, many think that he has got
by it; and that the <HI>Taxes</HI> which he has laid
on the <HI>Clergy</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> amount to more than he
has laid out upon it: It is certain, it has not
cost him very much. He retrenched all Ex|pences
to so great a degree, that even the pu|blick
<HI>Charities</HI> were lessened: for in <HI>Lent,</HI> there
is a weekly Charity of a <HI>Iulio,</HI> or a six pence,
to all the <HI>poor</HI> that come and ask it: and the
poor commonly brought their Children with
<PB N="125" REF="71">
them, so that they got as many <HI>Iulio's</HI> as
they brought <HI>Children;</HI> but the <HI>Pope</HI> limited
this, that no Charity should be given to any
under such an Age, as I remember it was be|low
ten year old. The Administration of the
<HI>Revenue</HI> is indeed the only thing that he un|derstands,
and in which he imploys all his
thoughts: and it was believed, that the true
Secret of the greatest number of the <HI>Cardi|nals</HI>
in the last <HI>Promotion,</HI> was the Advantages
that he made by the sale of the <HI>Offices</HI> which
they held, and that fell to the <HI>Pope</HI> upon their
Advancement; out of which it was thought
that he gained above a <HI>Million:</HI> and upon
this I will tell you, what I have learned con|cerning
the aversion that two of the <HI>Cardinals,
Taia</HI> and <HI>Ricci,</HI> expressed to the <HI>Purple</HI> in the
<HI>Promotion</HI> that was made five year ago; this
was magnified in several Books, that were
printed out of <HI>Italy,</HI> as somewhat that seemed
to approach to the best Ages of the Primitive
Times, when men refused to accept of so
great a <HI>Dignity,</HI> that brought them within a
step of the <HI>Supream Elevation:</HI> but the truth
of this matter was, they were both men of
<HI>Fourscore,</HI> and not like to live long; as they
both died within a year of their Preferment:
they had very good Imployments, which
they had bought, and which by their accep|ting
the <HI>Purple</HI> were to fall into the <HI>Popes</HI>
hands: besides that, the new <HI>Dignity</HI> was not
<PB N="126" REF="72">
to be entred upon without a great Expence:
so all this being considered, the vertue of re|fusing
so chargeable a <HI>Dignity,</HI> in men that
were more concerned for their <HI>Families,</HI> than
for that small remnant of life that was before
them, was not so very Extraordinary.</P>
<P>But since I am upon the discourse of <HI>promo|ting</HI>
of <HI>Cardinals,</HI> I will tell you a remarkable
Instance of a <HI>Promotion,</HI> that I do not remem|ber
to have met with in any <HI>Book;</HI> and the Dig|nity
of the <HI>Person</HI> and of the <HI>Family</HI> descended
from him makes me think it worth the rela|ting;
and the rather because I had it from no
ordinary person, but from one of the exactest
men in <HI>Rome,</HI> and who has taken the greatest
pains to be well Informed in the <HI>Modern Hi|story.</HI>
I had seen several pictures of <HI>Clara Far|nese,</HI>
for there are more than one of them in the
<HI>Palestrina:</HI> so I knowing nothing concerning
her, asked her story, which in short was this:
that she was P. <HI>Paul</HI> the <HI>3d's Sister,</HI> and the
person to whom he owed his <HI>Cardinals Cap,</HI>
and by Consequence all that followed upon it,
tho he rewarded her ill for it; for he <HI>poysoned</HI>
both <HI>her</HI> and his <HI>Mother,</HI> that he might have
all their Wealth; their <HI>Father</HI> was a poor
man, that went about selling <HI>Saucidges</HI> and
such sort of stuff. <HI>Clara</HI> was married young,
and was soon a <HI>Widdow;</HI> she was a lovely wo|man,
but no Extraordinary beauty: her <HI>Bro|ther</HI>
was bred to Letters, and was one of those
<PB N="127" REF="72">
poor <HI>Churchmen,</HI> that was looking about on all
hands where he might find a Patron; when of a
sudden his <HI>Sisters</HI> charms and her artifices toge|ther
raised him to a height, to which he was far
enough from pretending at that time. On a
great occasion <HI>Clara Farnese</HI> was so near P. <HI>A|lexander</HI>
the 6^t^h, and was so much in his Eye &amp;
in his thoughts, that he ordered one that was
about him, to enquire who she was, and where
she lived: Instruments upon such occasions are
never wanting to great Persons: and notwith|standing
the <HI>Popes</HI> great Age, yet his Vices
hung still so close to him, that he could have
no quiet till <HI>Clara Farnese</HI> was brought him.
She resolved to manage her self on this occa|sion,
and to raise her price all that was possi|ble,
so a <HI>Cardinals Cap</HI> to her Brother was
both asked and granted: a promise of it was
made at least, upon which she came and atten|ded
on the old leud <HI>Pope:</HI> yet when the next
<HI>Promotion</HI> came to be in agitation, the Propo|sition
for <HI>Abbot Farnese</HI> was rejected by <HI>Cesar
Borgia</HI> with scorn; he had never been a slave to
his word, and he had no mind that his <HI>Father</HI>
should observe it on this occasion.</P>
<P>The way of a <HI>Promotion</HI> is this, the <HI>Pope</HI>
setles the <HI>List</HI> of the <HI>Cardinals,</HI> and writes
down all their names in a paper with his own
hand; and in a <HI>Consistory,</HI> when all other business
is ended, he throws down the <HI>Paper</HI> on the Ta|ble,
and say's to the Cardinals, <HI>habetis Fratres;
<PB N="128" REF="73">
you have now some Brethren.</HI> One of the <HI>Se|cretaries</HI>
upon that takes up the Paper, and
reads the <HI>Names</HI> aloud; and the <HI>Sbiri</HI> are at
the door, and as soon as one is named, they run
for it, to see who shall be able to carry the first
newes of it to the party concerned.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion, the <HI>Pope</HI> after he had con|certed
the <HI>Promotion</HI> with his <HI>Son,</HI> writ down
all the names. <HI>Clara Farnese</HI> was in great appre|hensions
for her <HI>Brother,</HI> so she being to pass
that night with the <HI>Pope,</HI> rise when the old
man was fast asleep, &amp; searched his Pocket, &amp;
found the <HI>Paper,</HI> but her <HI>Brothers</HI> name was
not in it: then she set her self with great care to
counterfeit the <HI>Popes hand;</HI> and writ her <HI>Bro|thers
name</HI> the first in the <HI>List:</HI> next morning
she kept the <HI>Pope</HI> as long in bed as was possi|ble;
till word was brought him, that the <HI>Con|sistory</HI>
was set, and that the <HI>Cardinals</HI> were all
come: for she reckoned that the less time that
the <HI>Pope</HI> had for being drest, there was the
less Danger of his looking into his <HI>Paper:</HI> So
without ever opening it, he went into the
<HI>Consistory,</HI> and according to Custom, he threw
down the <HI>list</HI> on the Table: but to the great
surprise of him, and of all that were upon his
Secrets, the first name that was read, was that
of <HI>Abbot Farnese;</HI> and it seems the <HI>Pope</HI>
thought it better to let the matter pass, than
to suffer the true secret of the business to break
out. It is well that the Doctrine of the Inten|tion,
<PB N="129" REF="73">
does not belong to the Creation of <HI>Car|dinals,</HI>
otherwise here was a Nullity with a
Witness. Thus begun that long course of
P. <HI>Paul</HI> the <HI>thirds</HI> greatness, who lived above
50 <HI>years</HI> after this, and laid the Foundation of
the Family of <HI>Parma,</HI> which he saw quite
overthrown, his <HI>Son</HI> being assassinated in his
own time; and both his <HI>Grand-children</HI> having
revolted against him, which, as was believed,
precipitated his death, tho he was then <HI>Four|score.</HI></P>
<P>But now I return to the present <HI>Pope;</HI> for I
have writ you a very loose sort of a <HI>Letter,</HI> all
made up of digressions. His aversion to the
<HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Iesuites</HI> is very visible; for he takes
all occasions to mortify them; and every thing
that is proposed to him, thrives the worse
for their sakes, if he believes they are concer|ned
in it; which was given by all at <HI>Rome,</HI> as
the true reason of the cold usage that the <HI>En|glish
Ambassadour</HI> found there. Indeed the
<HI>Pope</HI> is not singular in the hard thoughts that
he has of that <HI>Order:</HI> I never saw an Indiffe|rent
man in all <HI>Italy,</HI> that was of another mind:
they do generally look upon them as a Cove|tous,
Fraudulent, Intriguing, and turbulent
sort of people; who can never be at quiet, un|less
they <HI>reign:</HI> who are men of no Morals,
that will stick at nothing that may raise the
Wealth and Power of their <HI>Order:</HI> and at
<HI>Rome</HI> they do not stick to say, that all the con|cerns
<PB N="130" REF="74">
of the <HI>Roman Catholick Religion</HI> must
needs miscarry in <HI>England,</HI> because the <HI>Iesu|ites</HI>
are so much in credit there. And indeed
the Extravagantly vain <HI>Letters</HI> that they write
to <HI>Rome</HI> out of <HI>England,</HI> are such contextures
of <HI>Legends,</HI> that ever since I saw them, I know
what value I ought to put on their <HI>Letters</HI> that
come from the <HI>Indies</HI> and other remote Coun|treys;
for when they take so great a Liberty
when the Falsehood is so easily found out,
what must me think of the <HI>Relations</HI> that come
from places at such a distance, that they may lie
with more assurance &amp; less hazard of discovery.</P>
<P>The <HI>Letter</HI> that was writ in <HI>February</HI> last
from <HI>Liege</HI> to the <HI>Iesuites</HI> at <HI>Friburg,</HI> of which
so many <HI>Copies</HI> were given, that it got to the
Press at last, was a good Instance of their Va|nity,
and of the small regard that they have
to a <HI>Prince,</HI> that has as they give out, so much
for them. Their representing the <HI>King,</HI> as
so concerned in the <HI>Interests</HI> of their <HI>Order,</HI>
that he espoused them all as if they were his
own, that he was now become a <HI>Son of the
Society,</HI> and that he was received into a com|munication
of the Merits of the <HI>Order,</HI> (tho
a share in their Treasure upon Earth were a
much more considerable thing, than of their
Treasure that is Invisible,) Their setting out
the <HI>Kings Zeal</HI> for their <HI>Religion,</HI> in such high
terms, that they say he is resolved to die a
<HI>Martyr</HI> rather than not to succeed in his de|sign
<PB N="131" REF="74">
<HI>of changing the Religion,</HI> and <HI>converting
the Nation:</HI> and this at a time when the <HI>King</HI>
was declaring himself so much for <HI>Liberty of
Conscience:</HI> and their affirming that the <HI>King</HI>
is become bigotted to so high a degree, as to
refuse to suffer a <HI>Priest</HI> to kneel down and do
the duty of a <HI>Subject</HI> in kissing his Hand,
and to tell him, <HI>that he himself ought rather to
kneel down, and to kiss his Hands:</HI> all these
are such Extravagant strains, that by the
boldness of them it is Evident, that they were
writ by a <HI>Iesuite,</HI> and my <HI>Copy</HI> came to me
from so good a hand, and so near the source,
that how many Falsehoods soever may be
in that <HI>Letter&punc;</HI> I can assure you, it is no Im|posture,
but was really <HI>writ</HI> by those of <HI>Liege.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, all the <HI>Romans</HI> have so very ill
an Opinion of the <HI>Iesuits,</HI> that as soon as any
piece of <HI>Newes</HI> comes from <HI>England,</HI> that is
not favourable to their Affairs, one finds all,
from the highest to the lowest, agree in the
same short reflection; <HI>Thus it must ever be,
where the Iesuites have such a share in the
Councils.</HI> A man long practised in the <HI>Court</HI>
of <HI>Rome,</HI> told me, it was impossible it could be
otherwise, for all the chief men of that <HI>Or|der</HI>
are kept teaching in their <HI>Schools,</HI> till
they are almost forty <HI>years</HI> of age; and by
that means Pedantry, a disputatious and
Imperious humour, and a peevish littleness
of soul, becomes natural to them, so that an
<PB N="132" REF="75">
Eminent man here said to me, <HI>It was Impos|sible
that matters could go better than they did
in</HI> England, <HI>as long as the Morals and the Poli|ticks
of the</HI> Jesuites, <HI>and the Vnderstandings
and Courage of the</HI> Irish, <HI>were so much relied
on.</HI></P>
<P>But besides all these General Considera|tions,
there are some things in the Constitu|tion
of the <HI>Order</HI> of the <HI>Iesuites</HI> that give
those at <HI>Rome</HI> reason enough to be on their
Guard against them. There are two things
peculiar to this <HI>Order</HI> that make it very for|midable;
the one is, that those who have
made the fourth <HI>vow</HI> are capable of no Pre|ferment,
unless it be to be <HI>Cardinals,</HI> and
then they are indeed capable of <HI>Bishopricks.</HI>
In most of the other <HI>Orders,</HI> every man has his
own private Interest, and his particular
views; so that they are not always looking
after the concerns of their <HI>Order.</HI> But a
<HI>Iesuite</HI> can receive no Honour but from his
<HI>Order,</HI> therefore he Consecrates himself to
it, and advances the <HI>Interests</HI> of the <HI>Society</HI>
with all possible zeal, knowing that there
is no other way left him to advance his own
<HI>Interests,</HI> but this. So that Hope being one
of the great Springs of humane Nature, a
<HI>Iesuite,</HI> who hopes for nothing but from his
<HI>Order,</HI> must be extreamly devoted to it. Be|sides
this, a <HI>Iesuite</HI> fears nothing but from
his <HI>Order:</HI> They have not a <HI>Cardinal Pro|tector,</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="75">
as the other <HI>Orders</HI> have, to whom
an Appeal lies from the sentence of the <HI>Ge|neral</HI>
of the <HI>Order:</HI> but the <HI>Iesuites</HI> are a body
more shut up within themselves; for the
sentence of the <HI>General</HI> is definitive, and can
never be reviewed, no <HI>Appeal</HI> lying from it:
whensoever a <HI>Pope</HI> comes that dares mortify
them, he will open a way for <HI>Appeals,</HI> for
till that is done, the <HI>General</HI> of the <HI>Iesuites</HI> is
the most Absolute and the most Arbitrary
Soveraign that is in the World.</P>
<P>All these things concur to Unite almost
all the several <HI>Interests</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> against this
<HI>Society,</HI> which yet is strong enough to sup|port
it self against them all: they have the
<HI>Mission</HI> generally in their hands; for the Con|gregation
<HI>de Propaganda,</HI> payes a small pen|sion
of 20 <HI>Crowns</HI> to all the <HI>Secular Priests</HI>
that are on the <HI>Mission,</HI> whereas the <HI>Iesuites</HI>
bear the expences of their own <HI>Missionaries,</HI>
to whom they allow an 100 <HI>Crowns</HI> a year: &amp;
so those of the <HI>Propaganda</HI> being willing to be
eased of a charge, accept of the <HI>Missionaries</HI>
that the <HI>Iesuites</HI> offer them: and they find
their account in this. Their <HI>Missionaries</HI> are
powerfully recommended, so they are quickly
received into <HI>Families,</HI> especially where there
are yong <HI>children</HI> to be bred up, or <HI>Estates</HI>
to be managed: for in these two lies their
strength: but they never forget their <HI>Order,</HI>
for which they are as so many <HI>Factors</HI> every
<PB N="134" REF="76">
where: and they draw vast Presents from all
places to the <HI>House</HI> that returns them their
Appointments; wheras the poor <HI>Secular Priest</HI>
must make a shift to live out of the small al|lowance
that he has from the Congregation
<HI>de Propaganda fide,</HI> and out of what he can
raise by his <HI>Masses.</HI> Therefore there is nothing
that they desire so much, as to see <HI>Protestant
States</HI> that give a Tolerance to <HI>Popery,</HI> grow
once so wise as to shut out all the <HI>Regulars,</HI> and
above all the <HI>Iesuites;</HI> and to admit none but
<HI>Secular Priests:</HI> for the former, as they are
so many <HI>Agents,</HI> to return all the wealth that
they can possibly draw together, to the <HI>house</HI>
to which they belong, so they are united to|gether
in one Body, under a most strict O|bedience
to their <HI>General,</HI> which may be as
great a prejudice to the Peace and Security of
a <HI>Countrey,</HI> as the other is to its Wealth and
Abundance: on the other hand, the <HI>Secular
Priests</HI> are generally good-natured men, who
are only subject to their <HI>Bishop,</HI> and that have
no designs upon the <HI>Government,</HI> nor the Con|cerns
of any <HI>House</HI> that is in <HI>Forreign Parts</HI>
lying upon them: so that since those of that
Communion have the full exercise and all the
Consolation of their Religion from <HI>Secular
Priests,</HI> even those in <HI>Rome</HI> it self wonder at the
Error of <HI>Protestant States,</HI> who have not
Learned long ago to make this difference in
the Toleration that they allow: And one that
<PB N="135" REF="76">
has been almost <HI>50 years</HI> in the most refined
practices of the <HI>Court of Rome,</HI> said to me
with a very sensible concern, <HI>how happy
would we here reckon our selves, if we
could have a Toleration of our Religion allo|wed
in</HI> England, <HI>tho it were with an Eter|nal
Exclusion of all Regulars and Iesuites?</HI> and
added, that if he saw good grounds for ma|king
it, he himself would go and carry the
Proposition to those of the <HI>Propagan|da.</HI></P>
<P>And now I am sure, I have rambled over
a great Variety of matter, and have made
a shift to bring in to one place or other
of this <HI>Letter,</HI> a great many particulars,
that I could have hardly brought out in an
exactness of Method, without a much grea|ter
compass of words, and a greater stifness of
form: but I thought it was more natural, and
by consequence, that it would be more accep|table
to you, to make them follow one ano|ther,
in an easy and unforced contexture. I
have discoursed all these matters often over
and over again since I came into <HI>Italy:</HI> but
I have read very little concerning them; there|fore
there may be many things here, that
I mention because they were new to me,
that perhaps are no newes to those that are
much more Learned than my self. I have told
you all that I could gather upon these sub|jects
from the wisest and worthiest men that
<PB N="136" REF="77">
I found here: I have writ of all matters
freely to you, because I am in a Countrey
where freedom of discourse, in matters of
<HI>State</HI> especially, is practised in its utmost
extent.</P>
<P>I have yet matter for another long <HI>letter,</HI>
in which the matters of <HI>Religion</HI> will have
no share; for I will end all these in this:
and therfore there is one piece of the <HI>Super|stition</HI>
of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> that affected me too sen|sibly,
not to lead me to bestow a severe cen|sure
upon it. I went through that Coun|try
in <HI>October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> and was often
in great distress, because it was not possible
to find a Glass of <HI>Wine,</HI> that could be drunk,
all being either dead or sour. At <HI>Parma</HI> I
waited on an Eminent <HI>Person,</HI> and lamented
to him the misery of <HI>Travallers,</HI> since no
<HI>Wine</HI> was to be found that could be drunk:
he told me, the <HI>Natives</HI> felt this much more
sensibly than <HI>Strangers</HI> did, with whom it
was soon over, but they were condemned
to suffer that every <HI>year;</HI> and tho he himself
had <HI>Vineyards,</HI> that produced much more
Wine than he could consume, yet he could
not be Master of a good Glass of <HI>Wine,</HI> for a
great many <HI>Months</HI> of the year; since all
the <HI>people</HI> were possessed with this <HI>Superstition,</HI>
that it was Indispensably necessary to mix it
with <HI>Water</HI> in the <HI>Cask,</HI> that by this means
it drunk <HI>dead</HI> or <HI>sour</HI> for so great a part of the
<PB N="137" REF="77">
<HI>year:</HI> and all that could be said could not beat
this out of the heads of those that dressed their
<HI>Wine:</HI> but he added, that the <HI>Priests,</HI> who con|firmed
the <HI>vulgar</HI> in this Conceit, had found
a Device to excuse their own <HI>Wine</HI> from this
hard fate: for they said, it must needs be kept
unmixed, since in the <HI>Sacrament</HI> the <HI>Wine</HI> must
be pure, and is then only to be mixed with
<HI>Water;</HI> and thus in all their <HI>Cellars</HI> good <HI>Wine</HI>
is to be found, where there is not a drop any
where else that can be drunk: one would think
that this is to abuse the Weakness and Credu|lity
of the <HI>People,</HI> a little too grosly, when
they condemn all the <HI>laity</HI> to drink ill <HI>Wine,</HI>
whereas they themselves drink it pure, which
is felt more sensibly by the <HI>Laity,</HI> than the
depriving them of the <HI>Chalice,</HI> and the en|grossing
it to the <HI>Priest</HI> in the <HI>Sacrament.</HI>
Yet the <HI>Excise</HI> that is laid on the <HI>Wine</HI> in
<HI>Florence,</HI> has taught the Inhabitants a point
of Wisdom, that those on the other side of
the <HI>Appenins</HI> are not capable of; for the
<HI>Excise</HI> being raised upon all their <HI>Wine,</HI> the
<HI>People</HI> who have no mind to pay <HI>Excise</HI> for
<HI>Water,</HI> keep their <HI>Wine</HI> pure, so perhaps
some such severity in the Government in
<HI>Lombardy,</HI> may likewise reform them in this
piece of absurd <HI>Superstition,</HI> which I felt too
sensibly with all the effects that naturally fol|low
the drinking of sour Liquor, not to Insist
upon it with some more than ordinary con|cern.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="78">
But since I am upon the point, of the <HI>Arts</HI>
that the <HI>Convents</HI> have to live easy, I will end
this <HI>Letter</HI> with an account of a <HI>House</HI> that
was very Extraordinary, which I saw in my
way to <HI>Italy</HI> thro <HI>Bavaria; Etal,</HI> an Abbey
of <HI>Benedictines,</HI> that by its foundation is
bound only to maintain an <HI>Abbot</HI> and 25
<HI>Monks.</HI> It was founded by <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of
<HI>Bavaria,</HI> that was <HI>Emperour:</HI> the building
is not answerable to the Endowment, which
is so vast, that they keep a <HI>stable</HI> of 150 <HI>horses,</HI>
which is indeed one of the best in <HI>Germany,</HI>
the <HI>horses</HI> are of great value, and well kept:
they hunt perpetually, and live in as great an
abundance of all things as the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Ba|varia</HI>
himself can do; and yet these are
<HI>Religious men,</HI> that are dead to the World.</P>
<P>I cannot forget to tell you a very beau|tifully
diversified <HI>prospect</HI> that we had at
<HI>Burgo,</HI> a little <HI>Town</HI> in the hills of <HI>Trent,</HI> as
we lookt out at window, We saw before
us a lovely <HI>Meadow</HI> in all the Beauty and
Pride of the <HI>Moneth</HI> of <HI>May:</HI> a little beyond
that was a rising <HI>Bank</HI> all covered over with
<HI>Trees</HI> in their full verdure: beyond that the
ground rise higher, and the <HI>Trees</HI> had not
yet put out their leaves, and things lookt
dead and dry, as after Harvest: and beyond that
there was a huge <HI>hill,</HI> all covered on the top
with <HI>snow:</HI> so that here we saw in one pro|spect
all the <HI>seasons</HI> of the <HI>year:</HI> upon which
<PB N="139" REF="78">
one of the Company made this reflection,
that if any <HI>Painter</HI> should in one <HI>Landskip;</HI>
mix all these things, that were then in our
eye, he would be thought a man of an Ir|regular
fancy, whose designes did not agree
with nature; and yet we had them all then
before us. I will make no Excuses nor Com|pliments:
for those things do not mend
matters, and therefore I send you my <HI>Let|ter,</HI>
such as it is, just as it has grown under
my Pen: and so <HI>Adieu.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><POSTSCRIPT>
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>I find I have forgot to mention one very
extravagant piece of <HI>Devotion,</HI> to which
I was a Witness at <HI>Rome,</HI> on the 17 of <HI>Ianuary,</HI>
which is St. <HI>Anthonys day,</HI> that was the great
<HI>Father</HI> of the Monastick <HI>Orders,</HI> whose Life
is pretended to be writ by S. <HI>Athanase;</HI> all <HI>Hor|ses</HI>
and other Beasts of Burden are believed to
be in an especial manner under his <HI>Protection:</HI>
and the <HI>Monks</HI> of his <HI>Order,</HI> have a House
near <HI>St. Maria Maggiore;</HI> thither all the <HI>Hor|ses,
Mulets</HI> and <HI>Asses</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and all round
the <HI>City,</HI> are brought that day to the door of
the <HI>Church,</HI> where some <HI>Monks</HI> stand with a
Broom in <HI>holy water,</HI> and sprinkle it upon
them all: many <HI>Doggs</HI> and <HI>Lambs,</HI> and other
<PB N="140" REF="79">
favorite <HI>Animals,</HI> are also brought to share
in this <HI>Aspersion:</HI> which is believed to have
a most special vertue: the force of this hallo|wing
is believed to be such, that if any should
fail to bring his <HI>Horses</HI> thither, all the Neigh|bourhood
would look on those that have no
portion in it, as accursed <HI>Animals,</HI> upon
whom some unlucky Accident were hanging;
which is so firmly believed, that none would
hire a <HI>Horse</HI> or a <HI>Mulet,</HI> that had not been so
sprinkled. So that from the Popes <HI>Horses</HI>
down to the poorest man in <HI>Rome,</HI> all are
brought thither; but this is not all, the profi|table
part of this piece of Folly is, that every
one brings a Present; the richer sort send
Purses of <HI>Money;</HI> some give great Wax-<HI>Lights,</HI>
all stuck full of <HI>Testons</HI> (a piece of
20 pence) the poorer bring either smaller
pieces of <HI>Money,</HI> or Presents of <HI>Wine, Oyl,
Bread,</HI> or such things as they can afford: but
in a Word, no man comes empty; so that
this is the Market-day of those <HI>Monks,</HI> in
which for some <HI>Gallons</HI> of <HI>Water</HI> and <HI>Salt,</HI>
they get more Presents, than would serve
to maintain them for seven <HI>years:</HI> they quick|ly
convert all that is not necessary for
them into <HI>Money:</HI> and by this means they
are vastly rich. When I saw all this, I
could not but think that <HI>men</HI> must become
first <HI>Beasts</HI> themselves, before things of this
kind could pass upon them: but since I have
<PB N="141" REF="79">
added this in a <HI>Postscript,</HI> rather than give my
self the trouble to make it come in perti|nently
into my <HI>Letter</HI> I will add another par|ticular
that is writ me from <HI>Rome</HI> the sixth of
<HI>October</HI> 1687.</P>
<P>I am told, that men are now more puzled
in their thoughts with Relation to the business
of <HI>Molinos</HI> than ever. It was Visible that his
<HI>Abjuration</HI> was only a pretended thing; for
in effect he has abjured nothing: his party be|lieve,
that they are very numerous, not only
in <HI>Rome, Italy, Spain,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> and in
all these parts of the world, but that they
have many followers even in <HI>America</HI> it self:
one sees now in almost all the <HI>Churches</HI> in
<HI>Rome</HI> some of them <HI>praying</HI> in corners, with
their Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
and all in Tears, and Sighs; which is no
small trouble to those who thought they had
quite routed them: but find they are not so
much quasht as it was thought they would
have been by the mock Triumph that was
made upon <HI>Molinos.</HI> Nor do they believe a
word of those Reports that are spread of his
Leudness: they say, there was no Proof ever
brought of it; and that there are many <HI>thou|sands</HI>
in <HI>Rome,</HI> of both sexes, that conversed
much with him, who have all possible reason
to conclude, that all these stories that were
given out concerning him, are Impudent Ca|lumnies,
set about only to blast <HI>Him</HI> and his
<PB N="142" REF="80">
<HI>Doctrine:</HI> and the truth is, this seems to be
much confirmed by the <HI>Bull</HI> that condemns
his <HI>Books,</HI> and his <HI>Doctrine;</HI> in which no
mention is made of his ill <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI>
which had been very probably done if the
matter had been well proved: since this would
not only have satisfied people, with relation
to him, but would have very much confir|med
the Accusations of those horrid <HI>Opinions</HI>
that are laid to his Charge, Which had ap|peared
with much more Evidence, if it had
been found that his <HI>Life</HI> had agreed with
those <HI>Tenets:</HI> for tho it had not been a just
Inference to conclude him guilty of those
things, because they were charged on him
in the <HI>Bull,</HI> yet one may reckon it almost a
sure Inference, that he is not guilty of them,
since the <HI>Bull</HI> does not tax him for them.</P>

<HEAD>A THIRD
LETTER,
Concerning some of the
STATES
OF
ITALY;
And of their present Interest and
Policy.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Threw into my former <HI>Letter,</HI>
all those general <HI>Reflections</HI> on
the State of <HI>Religion,</HI> and the
Maxims of the <HI>Romans,</HI> con|cerning
it, that I could gather
together during my Stay at <HI>Rome.</HI>
Now I quit that subject, and shall at present
<PB N="144" REF="81">
entertain you with some <HI>Political Observa|tions,</HI>
which will be so much the more accep|table,
because I fancy they will be new to
you.</P>
<P>But before I go so far as <HI>Italy,</HI> I will give
you an account of a very curious <HI>Salt-work,</HI>
that I saw in my way to <HI>Italy,</HI> at <HI>Sode</HI> near
<HI>Francfort.</HI> It belongs to Mr. <HI>Malapert,</HI> and
has been wrought above 60 <HI>years;</HI> but the
present Master of it, as he is a man of great
worth, so he is very Ingenious, and has
much perfected that, which was managed at a
much greater Expence before he undertook it.
There rises at the foot of some little <HI>Hills,</HI>
which produce a very good <HI>Wine,</HI> a <HI>Spring
of Water,</HI> that is so very little brackish to the
tast, that one will hardly think it possible to
fetch much <HI>Salt</HI> out of it; yet it has such a tast
of <HI>Salt,</HI> that there was room for Industry to
prepare this <HI>Water,</HI> so that without such an
expence in Fire as should eat out the profit,
it might turn to a good account; which Mr.
<HI>Malapert</HI> seems to have carried as far as is
possible. The <HI>Meadow</HI> that lies in the levil
with this <HI>Spring,</HI> is Impregnate with <HI>Salt,
Iron, Nitre,</HI> and <HI>Sulphur:</HI> but <HI>Salt</HI> is that
which prevails: <HI>first</HI> then, a Pump is put upon
this <HI>Spring,</HI> which is managed by a Water|mil,
and throws up the Water about fifteen
Foot high; and then it goes by a Pipe into
vast <HI>Machines,</HI> that are made to receive it.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="81">
There is a great piece of ground Inclosed,
in which there are 24 vast <HI>Chests</HI> or <HI>Cisterns</HI> for
the <HI>Water,</HI> in two <HI>stories,</HI> 12 in a story, the
one just over the other; they are about <HI>seventy</HI>
foot long, <HI>twelve</HI> broad, and <HI>two</HI> deep; over
every one of these, there is a roof of boards,
supported by wooden Pillars, of 12 foot high;
which covers them from <HI>Rain</HI>-water, but yet
the water within them is in a full exposition
to the Sun; those roofs are hung with straw,
upon which some that manage the work, are
often throwing up the <HI>Water,</HI> so that a great
deal of the <HI>Phlegme</HI> is Imbibed by the Straw,
and the more fixed parts fall down: according
to the heat of the Season, this Evaporation of
the watry parts, goes quicker or slower; there
is a <HI>Gage,</HI> by which they <HI>Weigh</HI> the Water;
and so they know how the Evaporation
advances; it is of <HI>Silver,</HI> and is so made, that
according to the weight of the <HI>Water,</HI> it sinks
in it to such a depth; &amp; so by the degrees markt
upon it, they know how heavy the <HI>Water</HI> is:
according then to the heat of the season, and
the progress of the Evaporation, they let the
<HI>Water</HI> out of one <HI>Cistern</HI> into another, by a
<HI>Pipe,</HI> and when it has past thro the 12 that are in
the upper story, then it is conveyed down by
<HI>Pipes</HI> into the 12 that are below, and in them
all they continue still to throw up the water
upon the Withs of Straw, that are over head.</P>
<P>In a word, this <HI>Evaporation</HI> discharges the
<PB N="146" REF="82">
<HI>Water</HI> of so much of its <HI>Phlegin,</HI> that the same
quantity of water, that weighed one ounce
when it was drawn from the <HI>Spring,</HI> weighs
six ounces in this last Chest: and all this rolling
about of the Water from Chest to Chest lasts
sometimes not above twenty <HI>day's;</HI> but if
the season is only moderately hot, it will be
longer a doing; sometimes it will not be done
in a <HI>month's</HI> time: after that the <HI>Water</HI> is
brought to a very considerable degree of <HI>Salt|ness,</HI>
it is conveyed into two great <HI>Cauldrons,</HI>
that are 13 foot long, ten broad, &amp; 3&frac12; deep; un|der
which there are vast <HI>Furnaces,</HI> where in a
most violent <HI>Fire</HI> of 11 or 12 hours continuance,
the <HI>Water</HI> receives its last Evaporation; &amp; when
that is done, the <HI>Salt</HI> which is become thick,
but is still moist, is taken up in Baskets of
Willows, and placed about the wall of the
<HI>Furnace:</HI> and so the humidity that remains in
it drops out, and it is brought to its last degree
of perfection: out of it, a <HI>Tyth</HI> is payed; of
which the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Ments</HI> has one half, and
the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Francfort</HI> the other. This <HI>Salt</HI> is
exceeding good and pleasant to the tast. It
is much solider and more like the <HI>Portugal
Salt,</HI> than like our <HI>Newcastle salt.</HI> It ser|veth
very well all the uses of the <HI>Kitchin,</HI>
and <HI>Table:</HI> but it has not strength enough to
preserve things long. There are vast quanti|ties
made of it in hot and dry Summers: for
the <HI>Chests</HI> are always kept full: and thus all
<PB N="147" REF="82">
<HI>Franconia</HI> is furnished with <HI>Salt</HI> of its own
Production at very moderate rates; for there
is so great a lessening of the Expence of the
fire by this conveyance of the water thro so
many Chests, that it is afforded very cheap.
This I thought deserved well that I should
Interrupt the earnestness in which you be, to
hear what I have to tell you concerning <HI>Italy,</HI>
so that I hope you will not be ill pleased with
it, especially if your curiosity after the Histo|ry
of nature is as great as it was.</P>
<P>I now go over in one step all the <HI>Iourney</HI>
that I made from hence to <HI>Italy,</HI> which is cer|tainly
the <HI>highest</HI> scituated Country in <HI>Europe:</HI>
for as the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Danube,</HI> that rise in the
<HI>Alpes,</HI> and run down to the <HI>Ocean</HI> and the
<HI>Euxine,</HI> shewes you that all that tract of
ground to those Seas is a constant descent,
so when one comes to the <HI>Alpes,</HI> either on the
<HI>French</HI> or on the <HI>German</HI> side, he is a great
many days in climbing up those vast <HI>moun|tains,</HI>
but the descent on the <HI>Italian</HI> side is
very Inconsiderable. This appears yet more
sensible when one comes from <HI>Turin,</HI> where
the ascent up Mount <HI>Senice</HI> is but a work of
a few hours: and yet from the height of that
<HI>hill,</HI> one is in a constant descent till he comes
to <HI>Lions.</HI> I will not carry you about <HI>Italy,</HI> to
tell you the remarkable things that are there;
but will only tell you some particulars that
made the greatest Impression on my self, and
<PB N="148" REF="83">
which were not seen by Dr. <HI>Burnet.</HI></P>
<P>In my way from <HI>Parma</HI> to <HI>Mantua,</HI> I past at
<HI>Guastale,</HI> which is half way between them, 18
miles distant from both; where I saw a scene
that surprised me. This <HI>Town</HI> is situated on
the southside of the <HI>Po,</HI> at half a miles distance
from it: It was a considerable branch of the
Territory of <HI>Mantua,</HI> that was given off to one
of the <HI>Cadets</HI> of that <HI>Family,</HI> and was setled in
an intail to the <HI>Heir male.</HI> The best part of
the Revenue of this small <HI>Principality,</HI> was a
Duty that was payed for all <HI>merchandises</HI> that
went or came upon the <HI>Po,</HI> which when the
Trade of <HI>Italy</HI> was in a more flourishing condi|tion
than it is at present, was farmed for above
Threescore thousand <HI>Crowns.</HI> The situation
of this <HI>place</HI> makes it yet much more conside|rable
than it is in it self; for as it lies in the
neighbourhood of the Principalities of <HI>Parma</HI>
and <HI>Modena,</HI> and is not far from the <HI>Popes</HI>
Territory, so if this place is Master of the <HI>Po,</HI>
by crossing it, the detachments that may be
sent out from it are not only in the Territory
of <HI>Mantua,</HI> but they may be also in a very few
hours both in the <HI>Milanese</HI> and in the <HI>Vene|tian</HI>
Dominion; so that <HI>Guastale</HI> in some respect
may be esteemed the <HI>Center</HI> of all the <HI>States</HI> of
<HI>Lombardy.</HI> The Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> married
the Daughter of the last Duke of <HI>Guastal&eacute;,</HI>
who died in the year 1680. and his <HI>Nephew</HI>
Don <HI>Vespasiano Gonzaga,</HI> who was then in
<PB N="149" REF="83">
the <HI>Spanish</HI> service, was acknowledged to be
his undoubted <HI>Heir:</HI> so he came &amp; took peace|able
possession of his <HI>Dutchy:</HI> He was ex|treamly
much beloved by his <HI>Subjects,</HI> and
thought himself at quiet in the enjoyment of
his new Dignity: but all this was soon over|turned;
for one came to him from the <HI>Court
of France,</HI> to let him know, that that <HI>Great
King</HI> could not be wanting to his <HI>Ally</HI> the
Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> to whom <HI>Guastale</HI> be|longed
of right, his <HI>Dutchess</HI> being the
Daughter and <HI>Heir</HI> of the late <HI>Duke,</HI> and that
therefore since he had usurped the just right
of another, the <HI>French King</HI> warned him, that
if he did not withdraw of his own accord, he
would give order to put the D. of <HI>Mantua</HI> in
possession. It was to no purpose to argue
against all this, and to shew the Messenger
that <HI>Guastale</HI> was a <HI>Fee</HI> intailed on the <HI>Heir
male,</HI> of which there had never been the least
dispute: But reasons taken from the equity
of the thing, are seldom thought strong
enough to hold the ballance against reasons
of State: so the poor <HI>Prince</HI> being in no con|dition
to resist so powerful an Enemy, was
forced to abandon his Right, and to with|draw,
and he was again entertained by the
<HI>Spaniards.</HI> For tho there was a sort of a <HI>for|tification</HI>
cast about <HI>Guastale</HI> 50 or 60 year
ago, yet as that was at best an Inconsidera|ble
defence, so even that was now quite rui|ned.
<PB N="150" REF="84">
Upon his retiring there came a detache|ment
of 300 Men from <HI>Cassale,</HI> who took pos|session
of <HI>Guastale,</HI> and continue there to this
day: but this had been no great matter, if it
had not gone further: some years passed
after the new <HI>Duke</HI> was driven away before
the true design of this matter appeared. The
world was first to be laid to sleep. The <HI>Town</HI>
it self is composed of about six or seven thou|sand
<HI>Inhabitants;</HI> and so the small <HI>Garrison</HI> in
it seemed of no great Consequence, and was
rather an Advantage than a prejudice to the
<HI>Town;</HI> they were kept in very good order, and
they payed punctually for every thing that
they called for: only they brought the place in|to
the Method of a <HI>Garrison;</HI> for all must come
in and go out of the <HI>Town</HI> only at one Gate.</P>
<P>But in the beginning of the year 1686. the
mystery of this matter begun to appear: for
Mr. du <HI>Plessis,</HI> a French <HI>Engineer,</HI> came
thither, under the pretence of repairing the
old <HI>Fortifications,</HI> and designed a Noble and a
Regular <HI>Fortification:</HI> It is to be a <HI>Hexagone,</HI>
with all necessary Out-works; and there is a
great <HI>Splanade</HI> that is to be made round the
place, and all the houses or trees that are with|in
a considerable distance are to be beat
down. In a word, the design is great, and will
be executed in all the exactness of the <HI>modern</HI>
Fortification; so that the advantage of the
<HI>situation,</HI> will make it the most Important
<PB N="151" REF="84">
place of <HI>Italy,</HI> and that which will bridle all
<HI>Lombardy,</HI> and be able to put it all under Con|tribution
upon every occasion. The Works
were begun in April 1686. and ever since they
have kept 400 <HI>men</HI> constantly at work, upon
the pay of a <HI>Iulio</HI> a day: another year will go
near to finish it. And yet tho here the justest
ground possible, is given to alarm all <HI>Italy,</HI>
none seems to be so much as concerned at it.
The <HI>Venetians,</HI> that have at all other times,
valued themselves upon their prospect of Dan|ger,
even at the greatest distance, either do
not see this, or dare not own their fear. It
is true, all this is carried on in the name of
the D. of <HI>Mantua:</HI> but it is as certain, that
tho it lies so near him, he has never been at
the pains to go and see it: It has never been
so much as once considered by his <HI>Council;</HI> nor
is his <HI>Revenue</HI> in such a condition as to bear
such an encrease of Expence: and yet it passes
among the people there, that this is a great
strength, that is to be made to keep the <HI>French</HI>
out of <HI>Italy;</HI> and some <HI>Priests</HI> that are corrup|ted
to serve the <HI>French Interests</HI> promote this
Fiction. If the <HI>Venetians</HI> look on till this is fi|nished,
they will do very well to assure them|selves
of their new Conquests in the <HI>Morea,</HI>
for their Antient ones in the <HI>Terra firma</HI> of
<HI>Italy</HI> will probably fail them very quickly.</P>
<P>All those of the <HI>Territory,</HI> who know well
that their <HI>Princes</HI> name is only made use of,
<PB N="152" REF="85">
for the <HI>fortifying</HI> this place, look on with
great regret, while they see a Work advan|cing
so fast, that is to be a <HI>Citadel</HI> upon all their
<HI>Countrey:</HI> of which an Ancient <HI>Person</HI> of <HI>Qua|lity,</HI>
that is there spoke to me with so much
feeling, that he could hardly forbear weeping,
when he shewed me that Yoke of Slavery un|der
which they were falling. I saw, during
my stay in <HI>Mantua,</HI> how much all the sensible
people there, are concerned to see their <HI>Prince</HI>
deliver himself up so blindly to the <HI>French In|terests:</HI>
they told me, that since his <HI>childhood</HI>
he has been so beset with the <HI>Instruments</HI> and
<HI>Agents</HI> of that <HI>Court,</HI> that his Inclinations for
them are become as another nature in him: he
was not out of <HI>Childhood,</HI> when almost all
his <HI>Domesticks,</HI> and his <HI>masters,</HI> both for <HI>Lan|guages</HI>
and <HI>Armes,</HI> were furnished him from
thence. His putting <HI>Cassale</HI> in the hands of
that <HI>Monarch,</HI> was one good Evidence, and
now the business of <HI>Guastale</HI> is another, to
shew that they have gained such an Ascendant
over his Spirit, and have Insinuated them|selves
so much into him, in all those fatal
hours of Liberty which he allows himself, that
it is not thought he will stick at any thing that
they demand of him, unless it be at his own
going into <HI>France;</HI> to which he has been
much solicited: but it is not so much as doubt|ed,
that if he goes once into that <HI>Countrey,</HI>
he will never come out of it again. So he is
<PB N="153" REF="85">
not like to be wrought on so far; and if it
were not for some such apprehension, it is
like enough that he might undertake the
Journey; for he does not love staying in his
<HI>Principality</HI> so well, but takes pleasure to
ramble about; and he devests himself often
of the Ceremonies of his <HI>Greatness,</HI> that so he
may take a freer career in those <HI>Exerci|ses,</HI>
that he loves better than his <HI>Affairs:</HI>
and a <HI>Prince,</HI> whose <HI>Revenue</HI> is none of the
greatest, and whose expence is often Irregular,
who has an active <HI>Envoy</HI> always near him,
and who is ever ready to furnish him with
<HI>Money,</HI> falls naturally into a great dependence
on that <HI>Court.</HI></P>
<P>Of this a very Extraordinary Instance ap|peared
not long ago, in the Disgrace of the
Marquisses of <HI>Cannosse</HI> and <HI>Palliotti:</HI> the first
of these is his <HI>Kinsman,</HI> and has served him
now for many years, with as much Fide|lity
as Affection; the second was <HI>Captain</HI> of
his <HI>Guards,</HI> and <HI>Governour</HI> of the Castle of
<HI>Mantua</HI> which commands the <HI>Town.</HI> These
then had the Courage as well as the Fidelity,
to lay before him the Ruin that he was like
to bring upon himself as well as upon all <HI>Italy,</HI>
by delivering himself up so intirely to the
<HI>French Councils,</HI> and by putting them first
in possession of <HI>Guastale,</HI> and now suffering
then to <HI>Fortify</HI> it, which was in effect the
delivering up of his <HI>Principality,</HI> and of all
<PB N="154" REF="86">
his <HI>People</HI> to them; who looked upon them|selves
as brought already under a <HI>Forreign</HI>
Yoke: they also represented to him the dan|ger
of having almost no other <HI>Domesticks</HI> but
<HI>Frenchmen</HI> about him, who were all as so
many <HI>Spies</HI> upon him, and upon all that were
near him, and that were very exact in giving
the <HI>French Envoy</HI> Mr. <HI>Baumbeau</HI> an account
of every thing that he either said or did. These
Demonstrances made some Impressions on the
<HI>Duke,</HI> and he promised to them to find out
an effectuall Remedy to all those Evils:
But this was not a secret very long; <HI>Money</HI>
and <HI>Spies</HI> find out every thing; and it is possible
that they who gave the <HI>Duke</HI> these faithfull
Advices might have been engaged to it, either
by some Instruments of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI>
or of the Republick of <HI>Venice:</HI> yet the truth
of this is not known, but the <HI>French Envoy</HI>
made a shift to charge them so heavily, that
he got them <HI>both</HI> to be made close <HI>Prisoners;</HI>
in this condition they were when I was at
<HI>Mantua,</HI> and no body durst so much as men|tion
their Names, much less Interpose for
them.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> are as <HI>Absolute</HI>
in their own <HI>Dominions,</HI> and as much de|livered
from all the bonds of <HI>Law,</HI> as some
greater <HI>Kings</HI> are, so their <HI>subjects</HI> are at their
Mercy, both for their <HI>Lives, Liberties,</HI> and
<HI>Estates:</HI> and this is that from which one may
<PB N="155" REF="86">
take a sure measure of the weakness of <HI>Italy.
Subjects</HI> that retain still all the due liberties of
humane nature, and that are not under an
<HI>Arbitrary</HI> but a <HI>Legall</HI> Government; fight for
themselves, as well as for their <HI>Prince;</HI> but if
they are already as miserable as they can be,
so that a change may perhaps put them in a
better condition, but can hardly put them in
a worse, they will not much concern them|selves
in their <HI>Princes</HI> Quarrel, since they only
fight for the continuance, if not for the en|crease
of their Slavery.</P>
<P>But now to return to the Duke of <HI>Mantua;</HI>
the <HI>French Envoy</HI> has since that time stuck
closer to him than ever; he indeed waits
always on him, sometimes acting like an <HI>Officer</HI>
of his Houshold, and at other times like the
<HI>Governour</HI> of his Person: he made the tour of
<HI>Italy</HI> with him this <HI>year,</HI> and waited on him
to <HI>Millan, Genoa, Florence, Rome, Naples</HI>
and <HI>Venice,</HI> where they passed the <HI>Carnavall</HI>
together: and he took a most particular care
that the <HI>Duke</HI> should meet with none in all
those places, that might open his eyes, to
let him see the Ruin that he is bringing upon
himself; yet after all, one of his <HI>Secretaries,</HI>
had still the Integrity and Courage to give
him such faithful Councels, as had been fatal
to others: yet the <HI>Duke</HI> used him better than
he had done the two <HI>Marquisses:</HI> for tho the
<HI>French Spies</HI> discovered him likewise, yet,
<PB N="156" REF="87">
nothing could be done to hurt him in the
<HI>Dukes</HI> good opinion, therefore it was resolved
to take another method to tear so dangerous
a man from him; so he being sent to negotiate
some business at the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Turin,</HI> was often
invited to go a Hunting, which he resisted for
a great while, tho the <HI>French Ambassadour</HI>
pressed him much to it; at last he was over|come,
but his sport was fatal to him; for he
was seised on, and carried by a small <HI>Party</HI>
sent from <HI>Pignarol</HI> as is believed. In short,
he is in the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> and it is said
in <HI>Italy,</HI> that he is clapt up in St. <HI>Margarite</HI> one
of the little <HI>Islands</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean sea.</HI>
This matter was at first highly resented by
the <HI>Duke,</HI> but a little time will shew whether
the earesses of the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France</HI> can soften
him in this matter or not; for if they can lay
him asleep after such an Attempt, then all
persons will conclude that he is so much in
their power, that none will dare to run
the hazard of undeceiving him any more.</P>
<P>Those in the <HI>Mountferrat</HI> feel what a Neigh|bour
<HI>Cassal</HI> is to them; that Imperious way
of proceeding, without having any great re|gard
to Justice, or to Contracts and Aggree|ments,
that is practised in <HI>France,</HI> begins to
be felt here likewise: of which many smaller
Instances were given me, but I will tell you
two that were more remarkable; when the
<HI>Garrison</HI> was first setled in <HI>Cassal,</HI> those of the
<PB N="157" REF="87">
<HI>Mountferrat</HI> held the price of their <HI>Corn</HI> so high,
that it was hard to furnish the <HI>Garrison</HI> with
<HI>Bread:</HI> so some of <HI>Piedmont</HI> undertook to sup|ply
them for two years at 21 <HI>Livers</HI> the <HI>Ra|tion,</HI>
and the bargain being made&punc; they
bought in great stores, and so they quickly
filled their <HI>Granaries:</HI> upon this some in the
<HI>Mountferrat</HI> came and offered to serve the
Garrison at <HI>14 Livers</HI> the <HI>Ration,</HI> upon which
the other bargain tho made as sure as any such
contract can possibly be made, was broke,
and the undertakers were ruined by it. The
other story was, that in order to the building
the <HI>Fortifications,</HI> some <HI>Masons</HI> made a bargain
at <HI>32 Livers</HI> such a measure, so they brought
together a great number of Workmen, and
were at work; when others came and offer'd
to perform the work at <HI>28 Livers,</HI> for which
the others had <HI>32 Livers,</HI> only they deman|ded
a considerable advance; so the first Bar|gain
was presently broken, to the great loss of
the Undertakers: but the 2d Undertakers, that
had <HI>Money</HI> advanced them, found they had
made a Bargain that was too hard for them to
execute, so they ran away with the Money,
to the great joy of the Countrey. He that
told me this, said, that perhaps it surprised the
<HI>Italians,</HI> who were not yet acquainted with
such things; but nothing of that kind would
seem extraordinary in <HI>France,</HI> which was so
much accustomed to such a way of proceeding
<PB N="158" REF="88">
that he gave me a particular account of so
many, that he had reason to know well, as
would fill a Book: but that which touched
him most sensibly, was the <HI>Fonds</HI> that was made
for an <HI>East-India Company,</HI> to which the <HI>King</HI>
gave in <HI>three Millions,</HI> with this positive
Assurance, that all the Losses and Dammage
of the <HI>Company</HI> should fall on that <HI>Stock.</HI> This
was a great encouragment to draw in men, to
put <HI>Money</HI> into the stock, and the <HI>Court</HI> set on
the Project with so much Zeal, that <HI>Letters</HI>
were writ to all the great Bodies and Towns
of <HI>France,</HI> that were considered rather as
Commands than Desires: yet after all were
engaged, upon the first occasion the <HI>Kings</HI>
three <HI>Millions</HI> were taken out of the stock,
and the rest were left to shift for themselves.</P>
<P>But I must here give you an account of a
very Extraordinary Transaction in the <HI>Court</HI>
of <HI>Turin,</HI> which is likewise thought an effect
of the Authority that the <HI>Councils</HI> of <HI>France</HI>
have likewise there. The Marquis <HI>de Pianesse</HI>
the <HI>son</HI> of him that set on the <HI>Massacre</HI> of the
<HI>Protestants</HI> in the Valleys of <HI>Piedmont</HI> 34 years
ago, was in great favour with the late Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> but the war of <HI>Genoa</HI> miscarried so
in his hands in the year 1672 that the <HI>Duke</HI>
could never forgive him that matter; of which
the Resentments were so quick when he
died, that he left a charge on <HI>Madame Royale,</HI>
never to forgive him, nor to Imploy
<PB N="159" REF="88">
him: he upon his Disgrace retired into
<HI>France</HI> and was so well entertained there, that
he had Interest enough to procure a Recom|mendation
from the <HI>King</HI> to the Dutchess of
<HI>Savoy</HI> in his favour; but her Excuse was so rea|sonable,
being founded on the Orders she
had received from the <HI>Duke</HI> on his Death bed,
that there was no reply to be made to it: yet
afterwards a <HI>Nephew</HI> of his, the Count <HI>Massin,</HI>
was so happy in the <HI>Dutchesses</HI> favour, that he
found he only wanted a Head as able as his
<HI>Vncles</HI> was to support him in that credit, which
her favour gave him: and he was so much in
the good graces of <HI>Mad. Royale,</HI> that he at last
prevailed with her to bring his <HI>Vncle</HI> into the
chief <HI>Ministry;</HI> he being certainly one of the
ablest men that belongs to that <HI>Court;</HI> and the
pretence found to bring this about decently,
was, that the <HI>Dutchesse</HI> did secretly Intimate
to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> that she found it ne|cessary
to Imploy the Marq. <HI>de Pianesse,</HI> and
therfore she desired that the <HI>King</HI> would renew
his recommendation of him, which being
done, he was received into the <HI>Ministry,</HI> and
had the chief stroke in all Affairs: he placed
another of his <HI>Nephews</HI> about the <HI>Duke,</HI> and
supported him so that he got very far into his
favour, so Mr. <HI>de Pianesse</HI> observing great
Disorders in the <HI>Government,</HI> and a great and
useless Consumption of the <HI>Revenue,</HI> he In|structed
his <HI>Nephew</HI> that was about the <HI>Duke</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="89">
so well, that he entertained the young <HI>Duke</HI>
often upon these heads, who was not then
15 year <HI>old:</HI> he shewed him how his <HI>Countrey</HI>
was ruined by his <HI>Mothers</HI> ill conduct, and
was always suggesting to him the Necessity
of his assuming the <HI>Government,</HI> and putting
an end to his <HI>Mothers</HI> Regency, which is a
discourse to which all Persons of that Age
have such a natural Inclination, that it was
no wonder if both <HI>Vncle</HI> and <HI>Nephew</HI> came
to believe that the <HI>Duke</HI> hearkned to the Pro|position:
but the <HI>Duke</HI> thought it too hardy
a thing to venture on it, without consulting
it with some wiser heads; upon which Mr.
<HI>de Pianesses Nephew</HI> told him, that he would
bring his <HI>Vncle</HI> to him, who would conduct
the matter for him; for tho he had great obli|gations
to <HI>Madam Royale,</HI> yet his Fidelity
to his <HI>Prince,</HI> and his Affection to his <HI>Countrey</HI>
overcame them all. This was a great sur|prise
to the <HI>Duke,</HI> who looked on Mr. <HI>de
Pianesse</HI> as the person in the World, that
was the most obliged to his <HI>Mother,</HI> and
that was the most in her <HI>Interests:</HI> and it was
believed that the prejudice which this gave
him, blasted this whole design: yet he gave
him several Audiences in secret, and had
concerted with him the whole method, both
of assuming and managing the <HI>Government:</HI>
which was carried on so secretly, that there
was no suspition of the matter, till the day
<PB N="161" REF="89">
before it was to break out, and that the <HI>Duke</HI>
was to withdraw himself from his <HI>Mother:</HI>
but then it was discovered, and the <HI>Duke</HI> to
reconcile himself to his <HI>Mother,</HI> sacrificed
the <HI>Marq. de Pianesse</HI> to her resentments:
he was not only Disgraced, and put in Pri|son,
but his processe was made before the
Court of <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Chambery,</HI> for ha|ving
endeavoured to throw the <HI>Government</HI>
into a Confusion, by sowing of Division be|tween
the <HI>Duke</HI> and his <HI>Mother:</HI> yet he defen|ded
himself so well that he was acquitted, but
he continues still a Prisoner: upon his Dis|grace,
there was none that durst oppose him|self
to <HI>Mad. Royale,</HI> or offer any advices to the
<HI>Duke,</HI> so that the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Turin</HI> was as abso|lutely
governed by the Directions that were
sent from the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> as if the one
had been the <HI>Vassal,</HI> if not the <HI>Subject</HI> to the
other.</P>
<P>I will not prosecute this discourse to tell
you that which all <HI>Europe</HI> knows, of the de|signed
Match with the <HI>Infanta</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> by
which <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Piedmont</HI> would have un|doubtely
fallen into the hands of the <HI>French.</HI>
The breaking of this, and the <HI>Dukes</HI> being
<HI>Poysoned,</HI> as well as his <HI>Father</HI> had been, tho
his youth carried him thro it, are things too
well known, for you to be Ignorant of them.
It is true, those who <HI>Poysoned</HI> the present
<HI>Duke,</HI> have not been yet Discovered and pu|nished,
<PB N="162" REF="90">
as those were who poysoned his <HI>Fa|ther.</HI>
While I was at <HI>Turin,</HI> there was a
discourse, that the <HI>Duke</HI> was reflecting on
the Wise Advices that Mr. <HI>de Pianesse</HI> had
given him, and that he Intended not only to
bring him out of <HI>prison,</HI> but to receive him
again into the <HI>Ministry,</HI> which is confirmed
to me since I left those parts. There is no|thing
more Visible, than that the <HI>Dukes</HI> of
<HI>Savoy</HI> have sunk extreamly in this <HI>Age,</HI>
from the figure which they made in the <HI>last;</HI>
and how much soever they may have raised
their <HI>Titular</HI> Dignity, in having the Title
of <HI>Royal Highness</HI> given them, they have lost
as much in the <HI>Figure,</HI> that they made in the
affairs of <HI>Europe:</HI> and it is now almost too
late to think of a Remedy: for <HI>Pignerol</HI> and
<HI>Cassal</HI> are two very Inconvenient <HI>neighbours.</HI>
The truth is, the Vanity of this <HI>Title,</HI> and the
expenceful humour that their late <HI>Marria|ges</HI>
with <HI>France</HI> has spread among them, have
undone them, for instead of keeping good
<HI>Troops</HI> and strong <HI>places,</HI> all the <HI>Revenue</HI>
goes to the keeping up of the Magnifi|cence
of the <HI>Court;</HI> which is indeed very
splendid.</P>
<P>I will not ingage in a <HI>Relation</HI> of this last
Affair of the <HI>Valleys</HI> of <HI>Piedmont;</HI> for I could
not find particulars enough, to give you that
so distinctly as you may perhaps desire it. It
was all over, long before I came to <HI>Turin?</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="90">
but this I found, that all the <HI>Court</HI> there, were
ashamed of the matter: aud they took pains
upon Strangers, not without some affectation,
to convince them that the <HI>Duke</HI> was very hard|ly
drawn to it: that he was long pressed to it, by
the repeated Instances from the <HI>Court</HI> of
<HI>France;</HI> that he excused it, representing to
the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France</HI> the constant Fidelity of
those people ever since the last <HI>Edict</HI> of <HI>Paci|fication,</HI>
and their great Industry, so that
they were the profitablest Subjects that the
<HI>Duke</HI> had, and that the body of men which
they had given his <HI>Father</HI> in the last War with
<HI>Genoa,</HI> had done great Service; for it saved
the whole Army: but all these Excuses were
without effect; for the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France</HI> having
broken its own <HI>Faith,</HI> that had been given to
<HI>Hereticks,</HI> and in that shewed, how true a
respect it pays to the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Constance,</HI> had
a mind to engage other <HI>Princes</HI> to follow this
new Pattern of <HI>Fidelity</HI> that it set the world:
so the <HI>Duke</HI> was not only pressed to extirpate
the <HI>Hereticks</HI> of those <HI>Valeys;</HI> but this
Threatning was added, that if he would not
do it, the <HI>King</HI> would send his own <HI>Troops</HI> to
extirpate <HI>Heresy;</HI> for he would not only not
suffer it in his own <HI>Kingdom,</HI> but would even
drive it out of his <HI>Neighbourhood.</HI> He who
told me all this, knowing of what Countrey I
was, added, that perhaps he would within a
little while send the like Messages to some o|thers
of his Neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="91">
But to return to the expence that is made
in the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Turin,</HI> I cannot forget a dis|course
that I had on this subject with a <HI>German,</HI>
that was a man of very good sense: he told me,
that nothing ruined the <HI>Empire</HI> so much, as
the great Magnificence which all the <HI>Princes</HI>
affected to keep up in their <HI>Courts;</HI> and the
Luxury in which they begun to live, which
had much corrupted the Antient Simplicity
and Gallantry of that great and Warlike
<HI>Nation.</HI> Not only the <HI>Nobility,</HI> but their very
<HI>Princes</HI> travel into <HI>France;</HI> and are so much
taken with the Splendor &amp; Luxury that they
see there, that they return home quite spoiled
with the ill Impressions that this makes on
them. They carry home with them <HI>French-Cooks,</HI>
and all the contrivances of Pleasure
that are so much studied there, for the vitia|ting
the minds of their <HI>Countreymen:</HI> and by a
vast Expence, they not only exhaust their
<HI>Revenue,</HI> and ruin their <HI>Subjects,</HI> but they
become so liable to corruption, that if their
Income at home cannot support their charge,
both their <HI>Princes</HI> and their <HI>Ministers</HI> are re|duced,
as it were to the necessity of taking
Pensions, from those whose Instruments have
set on this Luxury, and whose Pensions will
still support it, till the <HI>Germans</HI> are suffi|ciently
enervated by the Feebleness into
which all that Luxury must needs throw
them, and then they will despise and trample
<PB N="165" REF="91">
upon them, as much as they do now Court
them. He who told me all this, added, that
the little <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>Empire,</HI> affected now
as much Splendor in their <HI>Courts</HI> as the <HI>Ele|ctors</HI>
did in the last <HI>Age,</HI> and that the <HI>Electors</HI>
lived now in as much Magnificence as
<HI>Crowned Heads</HI> did formerly. But he carried
his Observation further, and having staied
some considerable time both in <HI>Switzerland</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> he added, that Luxury and Ex|pence
were wicked things even in <HI>Monar|chys,</HI>
but they were fatal and destructive when
they got into <HI>Common-wealths;</HI> of which
the History of <HI>Lacedemon, Athens,</HI> and above
all of <HI>Rome,</HI> give proofs that are beyond
exception; for there is a <HI>Humility,</HI> a <HI>Sobriety,</HI>
and a <HI>Frugality,</HI> that is so necessary for their
preservation; that <HI>Kingdomes</HI> can be better-maintained
without <HI>Troops</HI> and strong <HI>Places,</HI>
than <HI>Common-wealths</HI> without these. An E|mulation
in Expence, a Vanity in Clothes,
Furniture, or Entertainments, are so con|trary
to all the principles upon which a <HI>Com|mon-wealth</HI>
must be either built or preserved,
that he said, he thought that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had
lost more of their real Strength, by the Pro|gress
that this Pest makes among them, than
by all the Expence of the <HI>last War,</HI> of
which they complain so much: and indeed
the men of Luxury and Vanity ought to be
driven out of <HI>Common-wealths,</HI> as publick
<PB N="166" REF="92">
Enemies to the Constitution of the <HI>Govern|ment:</HI>
since an irregular Profusion throws
them into Injustice and Oppression, and may
in time expose them to the Corruption of o|ther
<HI>Princes,</HI> and dissolves that Industry and
Application for Affairs by which only they
can subsist: for all the <HI>Maximes</HI> that relate to
a <HI>Common-wealth,</HI> there is none more Indi|spensable,
than <HI>that all men regulate their Ex|pence,
so that it may not exceed their Income:</HI>
and therefore he admired that part of the
<HI>Venetian</HI> Constitution, that regulates the
Expence of their <HI>Nobility;</HI> and concluded,
that if the <HI>States</HI> and the <HI>Cantons</HI> did not put
an effectual stop to the Progress of those Dis|orders
among them, the <HI>Figure</HI> that they had
made in all the Affairs of <HI>Europe,</HI> as it was in
a great degree already Eclipsed among the
<HI>Cantons,</HI> so would sink apace even in the
<HI>States;</HI> and this was all that was wanting,
to set up a <HI>new Monarchy</HI> in the <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P>But I have got such a trick of making Di|gressions,
that I find it is hardly possible for
me to hold long close to a point: there is
something in travelling, I fancy, that makes a
mans thoughts reel; and that leads his Pen to
wander about as much as his Person does: yet
I remember still what drew me into all this
ramble; It was the business of <HI>Guastale,</HI> and the
<HI>Court</HI> of <HI>Mantua</HI> that led me so far about. I
will say no more to you of the rest of <HI>Lombar|dy;</HI>
<PB N="167" REF="92">
nor will I enter into any description of
<HI>Tuscany;</HI> but shall only tell you one thing,
which both touched me much and pleased me
extreamly.</P>
<P>I need not inlarge to you on the Poverty &amp;
Misery that appears in <HI>Pisa,</HI> where there re|mains
yet enough to shew what they once
were, and how much they are now sunk from
what they were while they were a <HI>Free State:</HI>
but all this is much more sensible, when one
goes from hence to <HI>Lucca,</HI> which tho it has
not the advantage of situation that <HI>Pisa</HI> has,
yet is quite another sort of a place. The <HI>Town</HI>
is well built, full of <HI>People,</HI> and as full of <HI>Wealth:</HI>
the whole soil of this small <HI>State</HI> is well Culti|vated
and is full of <HI>Villages,</HI> all the marks and
effects of <HI>Liberty</HI> appear, in an Universal Ci|vility,
&amp; a generous and frank way of living:
This is also the place of all <HI>Italy</HI> that is freest
of all Crimes and Publick Vices; they value
themselves upon nothing but their <HI>Liberty,</HI> of
which the <HI>State</HI> is so Jealous, that the frequent
change of their <HI>Magistrates,</HI> from two
Moneths to two Moneths, &amp; the Restraint
in which they are kept while they bear <HI>Office,</HI>
they being indeed honorable Prisoners all the
while, have preserved that here, which so&punc;
many of their Neighbouring <HI>States</HI> have lost:
and as <HI>Liberty</HI> is engraven in <HI>Capital Letters,</HI>
upon the Publick Buildings of this <HI>State,</HI>
so it appears to be much deeper in all their
<PB N="168" REF="93">
Hearts. One sees the Effects of their <HI>Wealth,</HI>
in all their <HI>Publick</HI> works, as well as in the
<HI>Fortifications</HI> of this place, which are much
better, and better kept than in any place I
saw in <HI>Italy,</HI> except <HI>Genoa.</HI> There is on the
inward side of the <HI>Ramparts,</HI> a noble <HI>Planta|tion,</HI>
which is one of the beautifullest Deco|rations
that belongs to this place; for as there
is a considerable space left void between the
<HI>Ramparts</HI> and the <HI>Buildings,</HI> so this is planted
all about the whole Town, with several
rows of Trees, which afford pleasant Walks,
and a lovely Shade, which is no small mat|ter,
where they are exposed to so hot a
Sun.</P>
<P>I come in the last place to give you an account
of <HI>Genoa,</HI> which tho it is not able now to Com|pete
as it did some Ages ago with the <HI>Repu|blick</HI>
of <HI>Venice,</HI> yet is still a great Body and
full of Wealth; one that comes out of the
<HI>Popes Patrimony</HI> and <HI>Tuscany,</HI> into this nar|row
border that lies between the <HI>Hills</HI> and the
<HI>Sea,</HI> should expect to find as great a diffe|rence
between their abounding in People and
Wealth, as there is between the soil of these
two <HI>Countries:</HI> but he finds the change just
contrary to what in reason he ought to expect:
for all this edge of soil, is so full of <HI>Villages</HI>
and <HI>Towns,</HI> and there is so great a plenty of
<HI>Money</HI> and of every thing else here, that it
Amases a <HI>Traveller</HI> no less, than the abando|ned
state of those other places.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="93">
The numbers of the subjects of this <HI>Repu|blick,</HI>
are estimated to 330000 <HI>Persons;</HI> which
are thus reckoned up; In the Town of <HI>Genoa</HI>
it self there are about 80000. <HI>Persons:</HI> in the
<HI>Villages</HI> and <HI>Towns</HI> that lie <HI>Westward</HI> there
are 120000. and 30000. in those that lie to
the <HI>East:</HI> and the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the Island of
<HI>Corsica</HI> are reckoned to be 100000. They keep
two small <HI>Forts</HI> in <HI>Corsica,</HI> one at <HI>Calvi</HI> on
that end that looks to <HI>Genoa,</HI> and another
at <HI>Boniface</HI> on the other end that looks
to <HI>Sardinia;</HI> for they have let S. <HI>Fiorenza</HI> and
some other small places go to ruin. These
two are considerable in themselves, and com|mand
two very good Harbours; yet as the
building in <HI>Calvi</HI> are too much exposed and
too high, so <HI>Boniface</HI> is under a high Ground,
that is within musket shut of it, and that com|mands
it: these places are now in a sad condi|tion,
ill kept, and ill furnished both with
Men and Animunition, so that they could not
make a great Resistance, there being but
150 men in <HI>Calvi,</HI> and 200 in <HI>Boniface;</HI> and it
is believed, that the reason of their letting
S. <HI>Fiorenza</HI> go to ruin, is, the Greatness of
the Place, and the Expence of keeping it. The
<HI>Corses</HI> are extreamly brave, and have a Rage
in their courage, that would be much more
valueable and usefull than it is if they were
more governable, and could be brought un|der
an exact Discipline: but they are unruly,
<PB N="170" REF="94">
and as apt to Mutiny, when they see no Ene|my,
as to fight well when it comes to that.
The compass of the <HI>Fortification</HI> of <HI>Genoa</HI> is
an amasing thing; for it runs all along the hills
in a compass of many miles, I was told it was
above 15 mile, &amp; in the Expence that has been
laid out on this and on the two <HI>Moles,</HI> chiefly
the new one, one sees that this <HI>State</HI> spares
nothing which Publick safety or the Conve|nience
of Trade do require: these Publick
Works has run the <HI>Republick</HI> into a vast debt;
for they owe above Nine Millions of <HI>Crowns</HI>
that are upon the <HI>Bank,</HI> besides several other
debts, in particular their great Debt to St.
<HI>Georges House;</HI> the greatest part of the <HI>Re|venue</HI>
of this <HI>State</HI> stands engaged for the <HI>In|terest</HI>
that they pay, so that tho the whole
<HI>Revenue</HI> amounts to 1200000 <HI>Crowns,</HI> they
reckon that 900000 <HI>Crowns</HI> of this is engaged,
so that they have only three hundred thou|sand
<HI>Crowns</HI> clear for their whole Expence,
which is so small a matter, that it is no won|der
if they are in a low condition, and can do
little upon so narrow a fond: their <HI>Revenue</HI> rises
chiefly out of an <HI>Excise</HI> that falls so equally
upon all the <HI>Subjects</HI> of this <HI>State,</HI> that they
reckon that every man in <HI>Genoa,</HI> payes six
<HI>Crowns</HI> a year to the <HI>State.</HI> The whole Land
<HI>Forces</HI> of this <HI>State</HI> were but 3500 men, yet
of late they have raised them up to 4000 men;
of which 2500 are the Garrison of the <HI>City,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="94">
and there are 600 in <HI>Savona,</HI> which after the
<HI>City</HI> it self is the most Important place that
belongs to this <HI>State:</HI> the extent of the whole
<HI>Countrey,</HI> that goes by the name of the <HI>River
of Genoa,</HI> is 180 <HI>miles,</HI> of which 120 lie <HI>West|ward,</HI>
and 60 lie <HI>Eastward;</HI> the <HI>Mountains</HI>
that are almost Impassible are thought a suf|ficient
Defence to cover them from their
Neighbours in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and from the Duke
of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and the State of <HI>Millan.</HI> It is true,
they have one <HI>Fort</HI> called <HI>Gavi,</HI> that is 25
miles distant from the <HI>Town,</HI> which has all
the advantages of sitution that are possible for
keeping the Passes thro the Mountains: but
as they keep only a Garrison of 120 men in
it, so all things in it are so neglected, that
it could make no considerable Resistance to
an Enemy that could attack in vigorously.
In short, the strength of this <HI>State</HI> is very
Inconsiderable, their <HI>Souldiers</HI> are ill Disci|plined,
their <HI>Officers</HI> want Experience, and
they have no good <HI>Engineers;</HI> the New <HI>Mole</HI>
is indeed a vast work, built out into the <HI>Sea</HI>
seven fathom deep, and there are an hundred
pieces of <HI>Cannon</HI> on it to defend the Old Mole;
their Naval forces consist in six <HI>Galleys,</HI> and
and two Men of <HI>War;</HI> but these are not kept
as Ships of War, but are Imployed rather as
Merchant-men, so that they not only bear
their own Expence, but bring in an Over|plus
to the <HI>State.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="95">
<HI>Finale,</HI> which is the only Seaport that belongs
to the State of <HI>Millan,</HI> is a poor abandoned <HI>Vil|lage</HI>
without either Fortification or Garrison,
nor do the <HI>Spanish Galleys</HI> come there any
more; but make <HI>Genoa</HI> it self their Step, and
Passage between <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Millan:</HI> so that an
attempt upon <HI>Genoa</HI> was indeed the taking
of all the <HI>Milanese,</HI> since the communication
between <HI>Spain</HI> and it, being now thro <HI>Genoa,</HI>
whensoever this Republick falls into the
hands of the <HI>French,</HI> all the <HI>Millanese</HI> must
fall of it self, or rather indeed all <HI>Italy,</HI> must
needs fall with it.</P>
<P>This is as far as I could understand it the
outward force of <HI>Genoa:</HI> for it can expect
little from its <HI>Allies,</HI> it having none at all be|side
<HI>Spain:</HI> and the Slowness and Feebleness
of that <HI>Court,</HI> are too visible to give any <HI>State</HI>
great Courage that has no other support be|sides
this to depend on: As for their Neigh|bours
in <HI>Italy,</HI> they have no sort of Com|merce
with them; for they pretend to a de|gree
of Precedence, equal to the <HI>Venetians:</HI>
and to have the respect of a <HI>Crowned Head</HI>
pay'd to them, and this cuts off all Commu|nication
with the other <HI>Courts</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> who
consider <HI>Venice</HI> in another manner than they
do <HI>Genoa.</HI> As for <HI>Spain,</HI> they have all possible
Engagements with it: many of the richest Fa|milies
of <HI>Genoa</HI> have great <HI>Estates</HI> in the <HI>Mila|nese,</HI>
and the other Dominions of the <HI>King</HI> of
<PB N="173" REF="95">
<HI>Spain;</HI> so that they must upon their own ac|count
be true to the Interests of that Crown,
and <HI>Spain</HI> is as much concerned in their pre|servation
as in any of its own Provinces,
since it defends their Empire in <HI>Italy;</HI> so
that <HI>Genoa</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> are now inseparably
united to one another, by their mutual In|terests.</P>
<P>But I come next to give you some account
of the Inward state of <HI>Genoa.</HI> It is known,
that the Liberty was restored to them, by the
most earnest Intercession of that great <HI>Cap|tain,</HI>
and gallant Countrey-man, <HI>Andreas
Doria,</HI> whose Statue, in remembrance of this,
is set up in an open place in their <HI>Town:</HI> this
was in the year 1528. yet tho from that time
they had their Government in their own
hands, they were still obliged to let a Squa|dron
of the <HI>Spanish Gallys,</HI> stand in their <HI>Ar|senal,</HI>
who kept then a Fleet of about 80.
<HI>Gallys,</HI> so that till <HI>Spain</HI> was so much sunk
from its former Greatness, that it was no
more a Terrour to any of its <HI>Neighbours, Ge|noa</HI>
was still in great dread of having their
Liberty swallowed up by them, and therefore
they do not reckon their entire Liberty but
from the year 1624. or 1625. that they saw
themselves out of all Danger from any of
their Neighbours: <HI>France</HI> was not then be|gun
to grow strong at Sea, and <HI>Spain</HI> was
strong no where; so that since that time, till
<PB N="174" REF="96">
<HI>France</HI> began to put out great Fleets, and
that they had such a dreadful Neighbour of
<HI>Touloun,</HI> they were safe and at quiet: but they
fell under the common Disease of all <HI>Common-wealths,</HI>
when they are long in Peace, and
while their Commerce flourishes; a Spirit
of Insolence and of Faction began to spread it
self over the whole <HI>Town,</HI> which was grown
to such a height, that in the <HI>Project</HI> that was
offered to the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> shewing the
easiness of this Conquest (of which I have
seen the Copy) the Divisions and Factions
amongst them are proposed, as the chief
ground upon which they founded the Proba|bility
of the ruin of that <HI>Common-wealth.</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>three</HI> sorts of Persons in <HI>Genoa,</HI>
the <HI>Nobility,</HI> the <HI>Citizens,</HI> and the <HI>Inferior
People.</HI> There are two Ranks of <HI>Nobility,</HI> the
one is of the more <HI>Antient Families,</HI> the o|ther
is of those who have been chosen and
raised up to that Dignity of late. It is true,
the Aggreement that was made in the year
1576. between them, is exactly observed, by
which the Government and the Publick Im|ployments
are to be equally divided between
them: but yet there is so great a height of
Pride kept up among the Ancient Families,
that they will not Inter-marry with the other,
and think it a diminution to them, to enter
into any Familiarity with them, and even to
keep them Company: this on the other hand
<PB N="175" REF="96">
kindles an Indignation in those latter <HI>Families,</HI>
when they see themselves so much despised
by the other. The Ancient <HI>Families</HI> have a
necessary Dependence upon the <HI>Crown</HI> of
<HI>Spain,</HI> by the great Estates that they have in
their Dominions; but the others, whole
Estates lie rather in Money, which either is
in the Bank, or that runs out in Exchange
or Trade, they are concerned in nothing but
in the preservation of their <HI>Bank,</HI> and by con|sequence
in their Liberty; for none can
doubt but that if they fell in the power of
another <HI>Prince,</HI> the Debts on the <HI>Bank</HI> would
be but ill payd. Thus the <HI>Nobility</HI> stand di|vided
into two Factions, which discover
their Animosities to one another upon very
many occasions: for <HI>Publick Imployments</HI> are
sought after here, with as much Intrigue as
elsewhere. I will give you only one Instance
of this, because it is both very refined, and
it related to that <HI>Doge,</HI> whose Government
was so unhappy both by the <HI>Bombarding</HI> of
<HI>Genoa,</HI> and by his own going to <HI>Versailles</HI>
to ask Pardon. He himself was a Man of a quiet
temper, that did not aspire; but his <HI>Wife</HI> could
not be satisfied till he was <HI>Doge,</HI> and she <HI>Do|gesse:</HI>
so she set so many Machines at work,
that after the several tours, that the matter
made in the many <HI>Ballottings,</HI> it came to the
fixing of the last <HI>three</HI> out of whom the
<HI>Doge</HI> was to be chosen: and her Husband
<PB N="176" REF="97">
was one of them; but there being one of
the three, of whom she was very apprehen|sive,
she engaged one of her Friends, to seem
so assured of his <HI>Election,</HI> as to lay considera|ble
wagers with several of the <HI>Electors,</HI> who
were likeliest to favour him, that he should be
chosen: now they having a greater mind to
win their Betts, than to promote their Friend,
gave their <HI>Votes</HI> in favour of him, that was
upon that made <HI>Doge.</HI></P>
<P>The 2^d body in <HI>Genoa</HI> is that of the <HI>Citizens,</HI>
who seem to be extreamly weary of the In|solence
of the <HI>Nobility;</HI> and there are many
among them, that think themselves no way
Inferiour to them, neither in the Antiquity,
nor in the Dignity of their <HI>Families.</HI> They
do also complain of a great Injustice done
them by the <HI>Nobility;</HI> for in the agreement
made between the <HI>Nobility</HI> and the <HI>Citizens,</HI>
in the year 1528. one <HI>Article</HI> was, that every
year <HI>ten Citizens</HI> should be according to their
merit received into their body. It is certain,
that if this had been observed, the <HI>Nobility</HI> of
<HI>Genoa</HI> had become by this time so common,
that this would have sunk its dignity ex|treamly:
but instead of doing this <HI>yearly,</HI>
it is now done but once in 30 <HI>years:</HI> so the
<HI>Citizens</HI> complane much, that this Encourag|ment
and Recompence of <HI>Merit</HI> is now with|drawn.
The <HI>Nobility</HI> pretend on the other
hand, that by that Agreement, they are
<PB N="177" REF="97">
only enabled to make an <HI>Annuall</HI> promotion,
but that they are not obliged to it: and I was
told, that the Originall <HI>Record</HI> of that Agree|ment,
could not be found now; and no doubt
it has been destroyed by the Order of the <HI>Se|nate.</HI>
In short, the <HI>Citizens</HI> have so great an
aversion to the <HI>Government,</HI> that it was ge|nerally
thought that they would easily be
prevailed on to shake it oft, and to throw
themselves rather into the Armes of another
<HI>Prince,</HI> who would certainly have very soon
trampled upon them all equally; for it is too
common a thing, to see in all those Intestine
<HI>Factions,</HI> that angry and ill-natured men,
consider the last Injury, more that all other
things: and are ready to sacrifice all to their
Resentments: and are so intent upon their
<HI>Revenges,</HI> that often they will not look
into the Consequences of what they do,
but go on, which way soever the Anger of
the <HI>Faction</HI> drives them: and those who are
wise enough, to make their own Advantage
of those Quarrels, and that are dextrous
enough to manage them artificially, make
commonly those <HI>parties</HI> take their turns in
using one another ill, in which they know
how to find their account: and as this ob|servation
holds often in <HI>Colder Climates,</HI> so
in a <HI>Countrey</HI> where revenges are very much
studied and gratified, no wonder if this was
much relied on. The third rank is of the
<HI>Trades men</HI> and Rabble, who have their chief,
<PB N="178" REF="98">
dependance upon the great <HI>Nobility:</HI> but they
are a Vicious and dissolute sort of <HI>People,</HI> as
any are in the world. And indeed all <HI>Genoa</HI> is
so extreamly corrupt, so Ignorant, and so
brutal, and so little acquainted with the true
Notions of <HI>Government,</HI> that here is a <HI>Com|mon-wealth</HI>
degenerated to such a degree, that
it cannot resist a considerable shock. The <HI>Sub|jects</HI>
are excessively Rich, tho the <HI>State</HI> is
Poor: and this appears both in the Magnifi|cence
of their <HI>Buildings,</HI> which is beyond
Imagination, and in the great <HI>Wealth</HI> that is
in their <HI>Churches</HI> and <HI>Convents,</HI> which see|med
to me to be beyond what is in <HI>Venice</HI> it
self.</P>
<P>A sensible man that I knew there told me,
that as there was among them a sort of Impu|nity
to all Kind of Vice, so their gross Igno|rance
made them Incapable to conduct their
<HI>State;</HI> for while their <HI>Wealth</HI> blew them up,
with that Pride that it commonly produces
in mean Souls, and when their Intrigues
brought them into a considerable share of
the <HI>Government,</HI> they satisfied themselves
with carrying on the Interests of their own
<HI>Cabal,</HI> and depressing those that opposed
them, without opening their minds to so
great a thought, as that of correcting or se|curing
their <HI>Common wealth.</HI> They neither
had Heads nor Hearts capable of a vigorous
Defence: and they knew nothing of what
was doing abroad; but contented themselves
<PB N="179" REF="98">
with minding the Interest of their <HI>City Fa|ctions.</HI>
He added, that when a <HI>Common-wealth</HI>
fell once into this Disease, it was in
a much worse state, than any to which
the Rigour even of an unhappy War, could
reduce it: as a man whose Vitals are In|wardly
corrupted, is in a much worse condi|tion,
than he that has received many Wounds;
Nature may bring him thro the one, tho
he had lost ever so much blood; whereas it
must sink under the other: so all the mischief
that could befall a <HI>Common-wealth</HI> could
hardly destroy it, if it retain'd the Inward
vigour of its first <HI>Maximes</HI> and <HI>Constitution:</HI>
and he did not stick to say, that as high as
the <HI>States of Holland</HI> were now in holding
the <HI>ballance of Europe,</HI> if their <HI>Towns</HI> fell once
into established <HI>factions,</HI> if <HI>Learning</HI> sunk
among them, so that their <HI>Magistrates</HI> grew
Ignorant, chiefly of the <HI>Affairs</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI>
if they came to have a <HI>Magistracy,</HI> that had
not the right understanding of <HI>War,</HI> and the
Courage with which some practice in <HI>Mili|tary</HI>
matters Inspire men, and if their <HI>Wealth</HI>
swelled them up to an Unreasonable Pride,
and that men rise more upon the little In|trigues
of <HI>City Factions,</HI> than upon true merit;
whensoever, he said, the <HI>States</HI> fell into this
disease, then the strength of that <HI>Republick</HI>
was gone; and tho they might subsist after
that longer or shorter, according to the Con|juncture
of Affairs, yet one might reckon
<PB N="180" REF="99">
them to be in their decline, which must end
in a most certain Ruin to them, either within
doors, or from abroad.</P>
<P>I have now told you enough to let you
see how reasonable a Project it was to send a
<HI>fleet</HI> against so feeble a <HI>body;</HI> which without
most prodigious Errors in the management,
could not have miscarried: and this is so clear,
and so confessed by every man in <HI>Genoa,</HI> that
one rather Wonders how they found a way to
conduct it so ill. The <HI>man</HI> that formed the
whole project was <HI>Stiven Valdyron</HI> of <HI>Nismes,</HI>
and a <HI>Protestant,</HI> who is a person of a very good
Understanding, and having lived above 12
years in <HI>Genoa,</HI> had time enough not only to
raise a very good Estate out of his Trade,
but to see into the whole Feebleness of that
<HI>Government.</HI> I conversed long and much with
him: and having since that time been in <HI>Ge|noa</HI>
it self, I have seen so clearly the truth of
all that he told me, that I may now assure
you of all that I learnt from him. He had
a strange affection to his <HI>Great Monarch,</HI>
and fancied that the obligations of raising
<HI>his Glory,</HI> was superiour to all other: and no
doubt he reckoned to find his own account
in it, if he could have been the occasion of
making the <HI>King of France</HI> Master of <HI>Genoa:</HI>
therefore he drew up the whole <HI>Project,</HI> and
shewed both of what Importance the thing
was; and how easily it might be executed:
for I have a <HI>Copy</HI> of the whole <HI>Scheme,</HI> which
<PB N="181" REF="99">
Mr. <HI>St. Olon</HI> sent to the <HI>Court of France,</HI> of
which Mr. <HI>Valdyron</HI> was indeed the <HI>Author;</HI>
the design being entertained, <HI>St. Olon</HI> had
an Intimation given him, to withdraw some
day's before the <HI>French fleet</HI> came before
the <HI>Town.</HI> But <HI>Valdyron</HI> was left to try his
hard fate; for as soon as the <HI>Fleet</HI> began to do
Acts of Hostility, <HI>Valdyron,</HI> who had been
known to be much with <HI>St. Olon,</HI> was clapt
in <HI>Prison,</HI> and while he was in it, a <HI>Bomb</HI>
broke thro his Prison, but did him to hurt,
only the violent noise it made weakned the
Tympan of his <HI>Ear</HI> so much, that he lost
his hearing of one side.</P>
<P>But he, as well as all <HI>Genoa,</HI> fancied they
were lost, and that the <HI>French</HI> must be cer|tainly
Masters of the <HI>Place</HI> in a few hours.
The Consternation and Confusion was so
great, that if at first a great shower of <HI>Bombs</HI>
had been thrown into the <HI>Town,</HI> and a de|scent
had been made, they had certainly suc|ceeded;
for the <HI>people</HI> were in such a disorder,
that the <HI>Magistrates</HI> were not regarded; and
indeed many of them shewed as much fear
as the rabble did. But the <HI>French,</HI> instead
of beginning vigorously at first, threw in
<HI>one</HI> Bomb, and after some hours <HI>another;</HI>
and so went on slowly for a day or two; in
which time, the <HI>People</HI> began to get into or|der,
and to take heart: and now their first
fear, turned to a Rage against the <HI>French;</HI>
so that when they made a descent, they found
<PB N="182" REF="100">
such a Resistance, that they were forced to
go back to their <HI>Ships,</HI> having left behind
them 500 of their best <HI>Men:</HI> and the <HI>Fleet</HI>
continued <HI>Bombarding</HI> the <HI>Town,</HI> till they
had shot all their <HI>Bombs;</HI> and when their
store was spent, they sail'd away, having laid a
great many noble <HI>buildings</HI> in ruines.</P>
<P>The <HI>morality</HI> of this way of proceeding,
was somewhat hard to be found out: the
<HI>Italians</HI> do not stick to say, it was an <HI>As|sassinat,</HI>
when without Warning or procee|ding
in the way of a fair <HI>War,</HI> a <HI>fleet</HI> came
and surprised and burnt a <HI>Town:</HI> but the
Conduct was as extraordinary, as the Action
it self was honorable and worthy of a MOST
CHRISTIAN KING.</P>
<P>It was pleasant to hear a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> that
belonged to the Count of <HI>Melgar</HI> talk of this
matter: he said, that in this, <HI>France</HI> had acted
as it had done on many other occasions, in
which tho it had the favourablest conjuncture
possible, it had done nothing suteable to what
might have been expected; for tho they had
here a calm <HI>Sea,</HI> for four dayes, which is a
very Extraordinary thing in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI>
that is almost alwayes in a <HI>Storm,</HI> and tho they
had surprised the <HI>Town,</HI> that had not the
least apprehension of such a Design, and found
them in a condition not likely to have resisted
a much smaller Force; yet he said, that Feeble|ness
which had appeared upon many other
occasions, shewed it self likewise here, since
<PB N="183" REF="100">
this great Expedition failed, and the Re|proach
of first attempting it, and then
Miscarrying in it, was studied to be carried
off by this, that the design was only to
<HI>Chastise Genoa,</HI> at which there is not a <HI>man</HI>
in the <HI>Town</HI> that does not laugh. He upon
this took a great compass for these last twenty
<HI>years</HI> backwards, to shew that there was no|thing
extraordinary in all this <HI>Reign,</HI> that had
been the Subject of so many <HI>Panegyricks,</HI> un|less
this may be reckoned extraordinary, that
there has been so little progress made, when
they had the fairest opportunities possible: an
Infant <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain,</HI> and a feeble <HI>Council,</HI>
and a Distraction in the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland;</HI> so
that the first Successes that were the Effects
of the weakness and surprise of those that
were attackt, are rather a Reproach than a
Glory to a <HI>Reign,</HI> that has understood so
ill how to serve it self of those advantages,
that had nothing of the Greatness of a <HI>Con|quering</HI>
Genius in it; and where the <HI>Ministry</HI>
shewed rather an exactness in executing little
Projects, than a largeness of Soul in laying
vast ones. I could not but be pleased to see a
<HI>Spaniard,</HI> find somewhat that entertained his
Pride in the Contempt of the <HI>French,</HI> at the
same time that the low estate of their Af|fairs,
made him feel the depression of their
own <HI>Empire</HI> as much as the progress of the
Great Monarch of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But now I cannot but tell you the rest of
<PB N="184" REF="101">
<HI>Valdyron's</HI> Story: as soon as the <HI>French</HI> were
gone, the Government of <HI>Genoa</HI> began to
examin him, but he stood to his denial, and
said, he knew nothing: all his <HI>Effects</HI> were
seised on and dissipated, and he himself was
four or five times put to the strapado, which
was done by tying his hands behind his back,
and fetching them over his Head, which dis|joynted
his Armes and Shoulder-blades, in a
most terrible manner, yet he had the firm|ness
to stand it out: and so they could draw
nothing from him: but as soon as the <HI>Court</HI>
of <HI>France</HI> understood, that both he, and seve|ral
other <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> that lived in <HI>Genoa,</HI>
were put in Prison, the <HI>Resident</HI> of <HI>Genoa</HI>
was clapt up at <HI>Paris:</HI> and when the Over|tures
were made to accommodate this matter,
<HI>Valdyron</HI> was no more ill used, and after
some Months he was set at Liberty: but
his <HI>Estate</HI> was quite lost: yet he came to
<HI>France,</HI> not doubting but that so great a Ser|vice,
and such severe Suffering, would have
procured him some considerable Reward:
but after he had languished there above a
year, he got a <HI>Pension,</HI> that was just enough
to keep him alive, of two hundred <HI>Crowns:</HI>
and even that was stopt, as soon it was known
that he was of the <HI>Religion,</HI> till he changed.
This piece of Gratitude for such a Service,
that had cost him so dear, was no extraordi|nary
Encouragement for others to venture as
he had done. Yet I who knew him well, for
<PB N="185" REF="101">
almost two years, could not but admire the
wonderful Zeal he had for the Glory of his
<HI>King;</HI> for in the midst of all his Misery, and
of all the Neglect he met with, having fallen
from so flourishing a condition, he could ne|ver
be brought to think that he had done foo|lishly:
but was rather proud of it, that he
had formed so sure a Scheme, for putting <HI>Ge|noa</HI>
into his <HI>Masters</HI> hands: &amp; this he said often
to me, when he was so poor, that he did not
know where to dine. The affinity of the
matter, makes me call to mind a conversation
that I had at <HI>Rome,</HI> with two of the Old <HI>Ma|gistrates</HI>
of <HI>Messina;</HI> who had been men that
bore a great stroak in that <HI>Town,</HI> during the
<HI>Revolt:</HI> and were then reduced to the misery
of accepting a Charity. They told us, that
all the <HI>Oaths,</HI> that Mr. <HI>de Vivonne,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>la Fueillade,</HI> swore to them in the <HI>Kings</HI> name,
as well as in their own, never to abandon
them, which were made upon the <HI>Sacrament,</HI>
besides whole Valleys of <HI>Oaths,</HI> that Mr. <HI>la
Fueillade</HI> made them from morning to night,
while he was among them, it seems went for
nothing, but matters of form: yet they said,
they thought the <HI>French Ministry</HI> would have
considered the <HI>Kings Interests,</HI> if they had no
regard to his <HI>Honour.</HI> They added, that if the
<HI>King</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> when he found the War of
<HI>Messina</HI> lay heavy upon him, had sent to <HI>Spain,</HI>
and offered to that <HI>Court,</HI> as a pledge of the
Peace that he was offering them at <HI>Nimmegen,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="102">
to put <HI>Messina</HI> again in to their hands, provided
they would grant an <HI>Indemnity</HI> for what was
past, and a Confirmation of their Antient
<HI>Priviledges,</HI> of which he himself would be
the <HI>Garand,</HI> this they said the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would
have without doubt, accepted as something
come to them from Heaven: and if the mat|ter
had ended thus, as it would have been
highly honourable for the <HI>King,</HI> so it would
have given him the dependance both of <HI>Sicily</HI>
and <HI>Naples,</HI> and have kept them still in a
disposition to throw themselves into his
hands: whereas in the way that their business
ended, if there should be in any time hereafter,
a provocation given in those parts to <HI>revolt,</HI>
they would sooner throw themselves into the
Armes of the <HI>Turk,</HI> if he should be again
in a condition to protect them, than of those
who had abandoned them in so strange a man|ner,
taking no care neither of the <HI>Priviledges</HI>
of the <HI>Town</HI> in general, nor of those particu|lar
<HI>Persons,</HI> who had rendred themselves un|pardonable
to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> It is true, some
were brought away to <HI>France,</HI> the <HI>two</HI> that
I have mentioned were of that number, and
had small <HI>Pensions</HI> assigned them, which were
but ill payed: and because some of them had
not patience enough to bear such an unlooked
for Usage, but complained freely of it, a pre|tence
was taken from thence, to <HI>banish</HI> them
all out of <HI>France;</HI> so that ever since they have
suffered a great deal of Misery. I will not
<PB N="187" REF="102">
digress so far as to give you an account of
that whole <HI>Revolt,</HI> which they justified to us,
from the great <HI>Priviledges</HI> of their <HI>Town,</HI>
which were indeed such as made it a sort of
a <HI>Common-wealth:</HI> that had a right to defend
it self against those manifest Infractions with
which they charged the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> They
told us, that the Confiscations of <HI>Messina</HI> had
amounted to twenty <HI>Millions:</HI> and yet for all
that the <HI>King of Spain</HI> was not much the ri|cher
by their Ruin; for the <HI>Vice-Roy</HI> and
<HI>Government</HI> of <HI>Sicily,</HI> pretended to exhaust all
by a <HI>Citadel</HI> that they are building: and by
some other publick Works. In Conclusion,
the two poor <HI>Messinesses,</HI> seeing a <HI>Dutchman</HI>
in our Company, turned the Discourse to
him, and wished him to warn his <HI>Countrey|men,</HI>
by their Fate, how much some <HI>Courts</HI>
ought to be relied on.</P>
<P>And now I have done with all the <HI>Political
Observations,</HI> that I could make in <HI>Italy.</HI> But
as I begun this <HI>Letter</HI> with one piece of <HI>Na|tural
History,</HI> I will end it with another. The
<HI>first</HI> was a way of preparing of <HI>Salt,</HI> and the
<HI>second</HI> is a new way of preparing of <HI>Vitriol,</HI>
which was lately set up in the <HI>Sulfatara,</HI>
near <HI>Puzzolo.</HI> It has not been long enough
a going, to enable one to judge how it will
succeed; but yet all things are very promi|sing;
and that which gives a good Prospect
of it, is, that all is done without the expence
of any <HI>fire.</HI> The Method of it is this. There
<PB N="188" REF="103">
are several <HI>Cistorns</HI> made in that great Bot|tom
of the <HI>Sulfatara,</HI> of great <HI>stones</HI> Cemented
very close: into these all the <HI>Rain</HI> both of
that Bottom, and of the little Hills that are
round it does fall, which is impregnated
with <HI>Vitriol:</HI> they do also lay a great many
Tiles and Bricks before all those Vents, that
the Fire which is in this Soil makes: and where
the Smoke comes out, with so rapid a vio|lence;
so that this Smoke passing thro these
Bricks, leaves a great deal of <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Vi|triol</HI>
upon them: and these Bricks are washed
in those <HI>Cisterns,</HI> and by this means the <HI>Wa|ter</HI>
becomes impregnated with <HI>Vitriol:</HI> then
they put the Water into <HI>Coppers,</HI> which they
set over those violent hot Eruptions; so that
this serves as a Fire, to evaporate the Phlegm,
and so they find quantities of <HI>Vitriol.</HI> The
revenue of this goes to the <HI>Annunciata</HI> of <HI>Na|ples:</HI>
and they begin to promise themselves
great advantages from it: but a little time
will shew this, as well as greater matters. I
will add no new trouble, to that which the
length of this <HI>Letter</HI> must needs have given
you: so I will conclude, without any other
Formality, but that of assuring you that I
am,</P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE>
<SIGNED>Your most humble Servant.</SIGNED>
<POSTSCRIPT>
<PB N="189" REF="103">
<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>SInce I added a <HI>Postscript</HI> to my <HI>two</HI> former
<HI>Letters,</HI> I intend to make this so far of a
piece with them, as to conclude this likewise
with one; for I find, looking over the little
Notes that I took, a Particular that had esca|ped
me, and yet it seems to deserve to be men|tioned:
and since I have not brought it into my
<HI>Letters,</HI> I have resolved to make a <HI>Postscript</HI>
express for it.</P>
<P>There is a little <HI>Town</HI> in the <HI>Appennins,</HI>
about 25 miles from <HI>Rome,</HI> called <HI>Norcia,</HI>
near which there is a considerable <HI>Abbey,</HI>
which belongs now to a <HI>Cardinal.</HI> This
<HI>Town,</HI> tho it lies within the <HI>Popes</HI> Territory,
yet has such great Priviledges still reserved
to it, that it my pass in some sort for a free
<HI>Common-wealth.</HI> They make their <HI>Lawes,</HI>
and choose their own <HI>Magistrates;</HI> but that
which is the most extraordinary part of their
Constitution, and that is the most exactly
observed, is, that they are so jealous of all
<HI>Priests,</HI> and of their having any share in their
<HI>Government,</HI> that no man that can either
read or write is capable of bearing a share in
their Government: so that their <HI>Magistracy,</HI>
which consists of 4 <HI>Persons,</HI> is alway's in the
hands of <HI>Vnlettered</HI> Men, who are called there
<HI>Li quatri Illiterati:</HI> for they think the least
<PB N="190" REF="104">
tendency to Letters, would bring them under
the ordinary Miseries that they see all their
Neighbours are brought under by the cre|dit
in which both the <HI>Robes</HI> are among
them. And they are so shy of all <HI>Churchmen,</HI>
and so jealous of their <HI>Liberty,</HI> that when
the <HI>Cardinal</HI> comes during the Heats of the
Summer sometimes, to his <HI>Abbey,</HI> they take
no notice of him, nor do they make any sort
of Court to him. One that has been oft
there, told me, that by divers of their Cu|stomes
they seem to be of the race of the old
<HI>Latines;</HI> and that their Situation and their
Poverty had at all times preserved them: yet
they are not such Strangers to the manners
of the rest of the <HI>Italians</HI> as not to take plea|sure
in severe revenges, of which this Instance
was given me. The <HI>Abbot</HI> that was the <HI>Car|dinals</HI>
Predecessor, had an <HI>Auditor</HI> who was
much in his favour, that made love to the
<HI>Wife</HI> of one of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of <HI>Norcia,</HI> which
she discovered to her <HI>Husband;</HI> he ordered her
to give the <HI>Auditor</HI> an Appointment; but
provided a good <HI>Surgeon</HI> and all other things
that were necessary to put the <HI>Auditor</HI> out of
all danger of breaking his Vow of Chastity:
for he was a <HI>Churchman;</HI> and the <HI>Auditor</HI> not
failing to observe his rendezvous, was caught,
and the operation was performed with all pos|sible
care: and he was treated very well till he
was quite cured, and then he was sent back to
his <HI>Patron.</HI> The <HI>Abbot</HI> was highly offended
<PB N="191" REF="104">
with this affront that was done him: and it
may be easily believed that the <HI>Auditor</HI> was not
well pleased with this forced Chastity that was
now Imposed on him: so they sent an Informa|tion
of the matter to the <HI>Rota;</HI> and asked their
opinion: but the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Rota</HI> was wiser
than to suffer a matter of this nature to become
publick. To this I shall add a pleasant thing
that was told me concerning <HI>Priests</HI> that fell
under the misfortune of this <HI>Auditor.</HI> It is
known, that according to the <HI>Canon Law,</HI>
the one Indelible Character defaces the other:
and that a <HI>Priest</HI> so treated can no more say
<HI>Mass:</HI> yet I was told that this distinction was
used, that if the <HI>Priest</HI> had <HI>all</HI> that was taken
from him restored to him, so that he could car|ry
it in his <HI>Pocket,</HI> he was still esteemed <HI>entire,</HI>
and might say <HI>Mass;</HI> but unless he could have
the consolation of carrying those things <HI>dead</HI>
about him, that had been perhaps too <HI>quick</HI>
before, the Character was lost, or was at least
under a totall suspension: If all this is a little too
pleasant and too natural, a little good humour
must be forgiven to a <HI>Traveller,</HI> whose Spirits
are too much in motion, to be so setled and so
grave as they ought to be.</P>
