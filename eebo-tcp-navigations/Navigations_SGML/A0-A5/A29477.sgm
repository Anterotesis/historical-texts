<HEAD>A Brief Relation of the Pre&s;ent State of <HI>Tangier,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HIS <HI>Excellence,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Tiveot</HI> Arrived here &s;afe upon <HI>Jun.</HI> the <HI>14th.</HI> (being <HI>eight</HI> dayes before the expiration of the <HI>Truce</HI> with <HI>Gayland</HI>) where he found that the <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> had obtained a continuance of the <HI>Truce</HI> for <HI>Two Moneths</HI> longer, according to the <HI>Te|nour</HI> of the former <HI>Articles;</HI> which <HI>Gayland</HI> a&s;&s;ured him was done in Civility and Re&s;pect to his <HI>Excel|lence:</HI> for which his <HI>Excellence</HI> &s;ent <HI>Gayland</HI> Thanks, Notifying withall, that it was not in his Power to continue the <HI>Truce,</HI> unle&s;&s;e permitted to Fortifie the Town: having expre&s;&s;ed Orders from the King his <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> for &s;o doing: But however, that in Honour to Colonel <HI>Fitz Gerrards Treatie,</HI> and to &s;hew his Thankfulne&s;&s;e to <HI>Gayland,</HI> he was Con|tent to &s;tick to every point of the <HI>Truce</HI> which was for <HI>Gaylands</HI> Advantage; And yet upon the mayn he was enforced to break immediately. Whereupon <HI>Gayland</HI> a&s;ked Fifteen Dayes to Con&s;ult with his <HI>Grandees,</HI> allowing that in the mean time his <HI>Excel|lence</HI> might <HI>Fortifie</HI> the Places <HI>next the Town,</HI> which was done accordingly. The prefixed time being Expired, <HI>Gayland</HI> &s;ent the <HI>Sheck</HI> of <HI>Anger as</HI> Son, to have a Conference with his <HI>Excellence,</HI> wherein he made appear that the <HI>Mahometan Law,</HI> prohibited them to &s;uffer the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> to build any <HI>Fortifica|tions</HI> in <HI>Affrica:</HI> But that they were contented to
<PB REF="3">make a <HI>War,</HI> and to give good <HI>Quarter;</HI> whereupon his <HI>Excellence</HI> Replyed, that <HI>The Sword &s;hould decyde, whether the</HI> Mahometan Law, <HI>or his</HI> Ma&s;ters Orders <HI>were of Greater Force.</HI> That he would neither take, <HI>nor</HI> give Quarter; withall, that <HI>he was</HI> Gaylands <HI>Humble Servant,</HI> de&s;iring them to &s;end immediately, for the <HI>Powder</HI> that was Stipulated for by the <HI>Deputy Governour.</HI></P>
<P>Next day, was the Foundation laid of a <HI>Horn-work Strong</HI> in the <HI>Walls;</HI> being <HI>Canon-proof;</HI> &s;trong in the <HI>Situation,</HI> being on the <HI>Ca&s;tle-Hill,</HI> every way Advantageous, and Important, becau&s;e it covereth the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> Fenceth above 600. <HI>Akers</HI> of Ground; di&s;covereth the Enemie at a great di&s;tance; and maketh the place Comfortable: Securing the whole Hill for our <HI>Walke,</HI> and <HI>&V;&s;e.</HI> (being, 600. yards from the <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI>) Our other <HI>Lines</HI> and <HI>Trenches</HI> were in a few dayes brought to that Perfection, that the Ene|mie dur&s;t not Attaque us. The great Advantage hereof we have Experienced in &s;everall Di&s;putes with the <HI>Moores,</HI> who on the la&s;t of <HI>Feb.</HI> betwixt 11. and 12. appeared with their whole <HI>Army,</HI> and took up their <HI>Po&s;ts;</HI> The greate&s;t Forces coming up|on the <HI>We&s;t part,</HI> towards the <HI>Sea;</HI> where they con|tinued Pelting for &s;ome hours till they were forced off, with con&s;iderable lo&s;&s;e, and not one of our Men <HI>Killed,</HI> or <HI>Wounded.</HI></P>
<P>The very next day following, and about the &s;ame hour, they came on again, but with greater Num|ber, and Courage; and took up their <HI>Posts</HI> as be|fore; pre&s;&s;ing towards the <HI>New Fort,</HI> which was then a <HI>Half-Bastion:</HI> (built while <HI>Gayland</HI> and his Armie,
<PB REF="3">Con&s;i&s;ting of about, 8000. Men, look't on) and for a long time continued Shooting, yet killed us but <HI>One</HI> Man. Their <HI>Maine Body</HI> &s;tood upon a Hill, hard by us; whence they continually &s;ent <HI>Reliefe:</HI> But at la&s;t, His <HI>Excellence,</HI> taking a fitt opportunity, Or|dred a Party of Hor&s;e, (Commanded by Captain <HI>Witham,</HI>) to Sally out, and bring in their <HI>Red Stan|dard,</HI> which was Pitched neer our Works: This &s;ucceeded according to Wi&s;h, for the <HI>Hor&s;e</HI> brought off the <HI>Standard, Killed</HI> the <HI>Bearer,</HI> with many more, and put the Re&s;t to <HI>Flight,</HI> without Suffering any Damage at all. In&s;tantly, His <HI>Excellence</HI> Comman|ded the <HI>Standard</HI> to be <HI>Di&s;played,</HI> upon that part of the <HI>Fort</HI> that was <HI>Built:</HI> which being &s;een by the E|nemie, they drew off in trouble, concluding the lo&s;&s;e of their <HI>Standard</HI> to be <HI>Ominous,</HI> the like not having been done before. Since this happened, they have not appeared in &s;uch great Bodyes as formerly, coming now only in Loo&s;e Parties, and Working by <HI>Ambu&s;cades;</HI> wherof the mo&s;t con&s;idrable, were tho&s;e of the 13th. and 17th. of <HI>March,</HI> the former was ve|ry &s;trong, con&s;i&s;ting of choyce Men, and the <HI>Chief Leaders;</HI> which on the &s;uddain Encountered our Hour&s;e, and great Courage was Expre&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides. We lo&s;t <HI>One</HI> man, and <HI>Two</HI> wounded; but very many of the <HI>Moores</HI> were Killed and Wounded, and the re&s;t compelled to Retreat. The <HI>Second,</HI> (<HI>March,</HI> 27th.) (being <HI>Sunday morning</HI>) was a &s;trong <HI>Ambu&s;h,</HI> both of <HI>Hor&s;e and Foot,</HI> Planted near Us; But after a Short, and Hott Di&s;pute, the <HI>Moores</HI> ran; <HI>Our Hor&s;e</HI> fell in among Them, and Slew &s;everal, and had done a farr greater Execution, but for the
<PB REF="4">Rocks and di&s;advantages of the Ground. Here we had onely <HI>One</HI> Man &s;hot through the Hand, while many of the Enemie were <HI>Killed: Two</HI> of their dead, His <HI>Excellence</HI> Commanded to be brought off by our men, whereof one by &s;everal things found about him, appeared to be a Per&s;on of Quality. That which makes this Action more Remarkable, was the Signal <HI>Humanity</HI> which his <HI>Excellence</HI> expre&s;t towards the <HI>Dead Bodies;</HI> for after <HI>Divine Service</HI> Celebrated, (it being <HI>Sunday</HI>) and <HI>Sermon</HI> ended in the <HI>Camp;</HI> His <HI>Excellence</HI> Commanded them to be wa&s;hed, while him&s;elf &s;tood by; and <HI>Two Bieres</HI> to be made, and the Dead to be Shrowded in white Linnen, and laid there|on, and &s;trewed with Flowers with all prudentiall decency: appointing afterward a <HI>White Flagg</HI> to be carried before the Bodies, after which, Marcht his <HI>Excellence</HI> on <HI>Hor&s;e-back,</HI> all the Troops attending in <HI>Squadrons,</HI> with Excellent Order and Mode&s;ty; and thus they pa&s;&s;ed to the utmo&s;t of the Bounds a&s;&s;igned us in time of Peace; where the <HI>Moores</HI> met the <HI>Bodies</HI> with a <HI>White Flagg,</HI> and received them with great Expre&s;&s;ions of Satisfaction; taking off their <HI>Caps</HI> and <HI>Sha&s;hes</HI> from their Heads, (a Cere|mony not u&s;ed in their Adorations,) in token of their Re&s;pect and Gratitude to his <HI>Excellence;</HI> much amazed at this unexpected Civility; (which up|braided their former Barbarous behaviour towards tho&s;e of ours, which have at any time fallen into their hands.) This was done with &s;atisfaction to both &s;ides, and without the lea&s;t appearance of En|mity, or ill will: and further to confirm their opini|on
<PB N="7" REF="4">of his <HI>Excellencies Honour</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;&s;e.</HI> This <HI>Truce</HI> was continued till they &s;ought and carried off their Dead Men.</P>
<P>Frequent Alarmes we have had; notwith&s;tanding which, his <HI>Excellence</HI> has not at all omitted to pro|&s;ecute the Fortifications; and it is a great Comfort to &s;ee how Chearfully, from the Highe&s;t to the Low|e&s;t, every man here puts his hands to the Work, in gathering, and bearing Stones, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in all &s;orts of Labour, and Hazzard, toward the perfecting thereof; out of a Generous and Loyal Emulation, to Imitate his <HI>Excellence;</HI> who <HI>Works, Eates,</HI> and <HI>Lodges</HI> in the <HI>Field,</HI> and has &s;carce been in Bed &s;ince the Expiration of the <HI>Truce.</HI> It is not to be Ex|pre&s;&s;ed with what Zeal, and Alacrity every man here does his Duty, under &s;o Exemplary a Gover|nour.</P>
<P>Neither are the <HI>Moores</HI> them&s;elves le&s;&s;e Moved, with the Frank and open Candour of his Behaviour, then they are Amazed at the Irre&s;i&s;tible Cour&s;e of his Succe&s;&s;e: To &s;ee him carry on his <HI>Fortifications</HI> and beat them too, at the &s;ame time; making it, but the one half of his Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to over-throw them; Even when <HI>Gayland</HI> was with his whole Army in the Field, to take away their <HI>Standard</HI> from before their Eyes! To Kill many of their Valiante&s;t Lea|ders, and Rout them upon all Encounters; and la&s;t of all, to Conquer them by <HI>Humanity,</HI> as well as by <HI>Force.</HI> Briefly, the Miracles, which his Lord&s;hip has done, have given the&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> a &s;trange Su|per&s;tition concerning him; Some &s;uppo&s;ing him to Act by the <HI>Devil;</HI> or however per&s;wading them|&s;elves,
<PB N="8" REF="5">that a&s;&s;uredly he is more then <HI>Man:</HI> Others have taken up a report, that he has made <HI>Flying Ships,</HI> and Great Guns to <HI>run alone,</HI> that he never &s;leeps but leaning again&s;t &s;ome part of the Works; and that having &s;caped &s;o many Dangers, and for his whole Life been &s;o Fortunate in Armes, it is in vaine to Re&s;i&s;t, and Impo&s;&s;ible to Wor&s;t him: And one thing more there is, that keeps them at a Di&s;tance, which is, their opinion, that the <HI>Approaches</HI> to this Place are all <HI>Mined,</HI> and that they cannot any where make an <HI>Attaque,</HI> without danger of being <HI>Blown up.</HI></P>
