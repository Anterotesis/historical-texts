<HEAD><HI>To his very Loving Friend</HI> T. G. <HI>in</HI> LONDON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ACcording to your earne&s;t Reque&s;t, you have here a full Account of the E&s;tate of this Country, as much as I have received from very good hands. I wi&s;h that it may give you that &s;atisfaction that you reque&s;t. It is certain that all that have written any thing of <HI>Africa,</HI> have &s;poken of it as blind Men of Colours, by gue&s;s, and by hear&s;ay. The Truth is &s;o mixed with Fables and Tales, that it is not ea&s;ie to di&s;tingui&s;h them. This Part of <HI>Africa</HI> is much changed within the&s;e two hundred years, and the Names of Places and People altered; &s;o that we &s;hall lo&s;e our labour to con|&s;ult the ancient Writers, concerning the pre&s;ent condition of this Country. It might give great &s;atisfaction to the Learned in the Northern Climates, to be informed of all the Tran&s;actions of this unknown World, but that we can never expect whil&s;t Trading is &s;o much neglected here and Strangers, e&s;pecially Chri&s;tians, do run &s;o many hazards when they enter into the Land; it being one of the Articles of the <HI>Moors</HI> Faith, that he that &s;heds Chri&s;tian Blood in
<PB N="2" REF="3">
their <HI>Ramedam,</HI> merits Heaven, and purcha&s;es the Eternal Favour of God with this Sacrifice: So great an invitation to Cruelty, may ju&s;tly &s;top us, that are not weary of our Lives, from running too far among&s;t them, unle&s;s it be upon a good account of Trading or Peace, and then none dares expo&s;e him&s;elf alone to the Peoples mercy without &s;ufficient guard to defend him; yet I have &s;een &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Merchants riding abroad without fear, and return &s;afely: I conceive they were known to the People, who are &s;en&s;ible that the acquaintance with forreign Nations, is very nece&s;&s;a|ry for their more convenient &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jews</HI> are to be &s;een every where in this Country, they are very &s;erviceable to the Inhabitants, for they furni&s;h them for the mo&s;t part with forreign Commodities, and make tho&s;e things that are nece&s;&s;ary for them. They never grow rich, but the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> do accu&s;e them of &s;ome Crime, to have a pretence to &s;eize upon their Trea&s;ure, as it happened lately to a <HI>Jew,</HI> who was grown a petty Prince; he Commanded a Place &s;trong by Situation and Art, called <HI>Darbinme&s;haal,</HI> there was but one a&s;cent, and that &s;o diffi|cult, that without his leave all the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> might have &s;pent their daies in the Siege of it; for be&s;ides that it is impregnable, it contains &s;o much ground within the Moun|tain as might very well nouri&s;h a thou&s;and head of Cattle, and &s;upply them with Corn and Fodder. This <HI>Jew</HI> had won the e&s;teem and favour of the Grandees round about by his courteous behaviour and good ho&s;pitality; for it was his cu&s;tom to invite all the Per&s;ons of Note into his City, and there entertain them very kindly: This dealing made every one, e&s;pecially the <HI>Arabs,</HI> to love him, and got him a great Name. When <HI>Muley Archeid,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Taffaletta,</HI> flung him&s;elf into the protection of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and that they had all owned him for their Prince, he was al&s;o entertained by this courteous <HI>Jew,</HI> and at a &s;mall provoca|tion he was ina&s;&s;acred: <HI>Taffaletta</HI> found one Point in the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to ju&s;tifie the Murder, which was ap|proved
<PB N="3" REF="3">
of, and applauded by the ignorant Multitude. A|nother <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>Jo&s;eph Ben-&s;imon,</HI> a very great Trader, and one that had Corre&s;pondents in many Places, did run the &s;ame Fortune. He &s;upplyed the <HI>Moors</HI> with many Commodities, e&s;pecially with Powder and Shot, Guns and other Weapons, which he conveyed out of <HI>Spain</HI> by &s;tealth. At la&s;t his Wealth made him guilty of Death, for he was accu&s;ed of Adultery, and although common report pro|nounced him innocent, he lo&s;t his Life, and had his E&s;tate &s;eized for the Kings U&s;e. Thus all the Princes of the&s;e Countries do treat this mi&s;erable Nation. When they have occa&s;ion for Money, they force it from the <HI>Jews,</HI> either by right or wrong. <HI>Gayland,</HI> as I am informed, did enter|tain <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Arzilla,</HI> for no other end but to have &s;ome on whom he might prey: He rai&s;ed a con&s;iderable Sum of Money from them on this occa&s;ion: About thirty or forty Families of the <HI>Jews</HI> had managed all the Trade of that part of the Country, and were grown rich; <HI>Gayland</HI> con|&s;ults his <HI>Cadir,</HI> and asks from this deceitful Oracle, whether it was lawful to &s;uffer <HI>Jews,</HI> Infidels, to dwell among&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;ulmans?</HI> He an&s;wered, That it was not lawful, but that if they would not turn <HI>Mahometans,</HI> he was comman|ded by the Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> to puni&s;h that contempt with pre&s;ent Death. This &s;ad News frighted the <HI>Jews,</HI> e&s;pecially when they heard that the day was appointed for their Exe|cution; in the mean whiles they Petition the Sultan, and make their Peace by offering a large &s;um of Money, all they had gathered in many years. This &s;atisfied <HI>Gayland</HI>'s weak Con&s;cience, concerning the bloody clau&s;e of <HI>Maho|mets</HI> Law, and made him free them from the great danger that threatened them. You &s;ee by that what favour Stran|gers may expect from this treacherous People.</P>
<P>But before I begin to inform you of my Journey from <HI>Tangier,</HI> and of the E&s;tate of this Count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">y, I will relate unto you &s;omething of our Pa&s;&s;age thither&punc; and of that fa|mous Garri&s;on: You may know many Particulars from
<PB N="4" REF="4">
them that have dwelt there &s;ome years; but from very few you may learn what I have ob&s;erv'd in that Place: Some things I have taken notice of, which if they were well known in <HI>England,</HI> and minded, might make it a happy City.</P>
<P>At our departure from <HI>England,</HI> we &s;ailed near the <HI>Sylly</HI> I&s;lands, where we met with a North-we&s;t Wind that blew very fre&s;h a day and a night; we made &s;uch Advantage of it, that in that time we were carried near 80 Leagues from the Lands End, into the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay;</HI> a mo&s;t dreadful Sea, at the lea&s;t breath of Wind the Waves &s;well into Mountains: It is a grievous thing to be to&s;t in this Sea by a Tempe&s;t: The danger is able to try the &s;toute&s;t Courage. I know it by our Pa&s;&s;age over this Place, the wind began to turn about, and then we heard that doleful Cry of the Seamen, <HI>No Near</HI> That begat in us a longing to &s;ee the plea&s;ant Shore; but we were not long before the wind favoured us again, which did &s;ometimes to&s;s us till we were come near the Coa&s;t of <HI>Portu|gal,</HI> where we met with the&s;e Particulars that I cannot o|mit:</P>
<P>In a lovely calm Morning, as the Sun began to look up|on us, and vi&s;it us with his Beams, the Air being clear, and the Weather mo&s;t plea&s;ant, we &s;pied a Face of a Ri&s;ing of the Water; the Seamen called it a Spout: I know no other Name for it, unle&s;s I call it the greate&s;t Miracle in Nature; The Figure was like a Pyramide, &s;harp at the top, and large at the bottom, about the compa&s;s of two or three Acres of Ground; the Top reach'd &s;o high, that I could not well di&s;|cover it: I wondred at the &s;ight, &s;o did many of the Sea|men, who profe&s;&s;ed to have never &s;een the like in the Nor|thern Parts. I admired from whence &s;uch a Violence in Na|ture could proceed; That the Water &s;hould leave its own Element, and a&s;cend up into the Air, and in &s;uch great quan|tity, it is not po&s;&s;ible without &s;ome mo&s;t powerful Agent: I began to rea&s;on with &s;ome who e&s;teem them&s;elves of the more refined Souls, and to ask their Judgment about it; but&punc;
<PB N="5" REF="4">
I found their An&s;wers &s;o dull and impertinent, that I quickly di&s;covered their ignorance. We &s;ailed within two Leagues of the Place, and had time to behold it at our lei&s;ure; as we approached nearer, we found a Current turning that way, which, if we had ventured farther, might have endan|gered our Lives; but the wind being pretty fre&s;h, and all our Sails open, the Current at &s;uch a di&s;tance, could not prevail upon us. One thing we took notice of, which &s;eem'd very wonderful; out of the Pyramid of Waters about a hun|dred Yards high, leapt &s;omething that was Bulky; for it made a Plunge in the Water, that appear'd to us, we imagin|ed it to be a Fi&s;h of a con&s;iderable Bigne&s;s, which the vio|lent A&s;cent of the water had &s;ent up in the Air, but then meeting with a le&s;&s;er and a weaker motion, at a di&s;tance from the Sea, it had the power to free it &s;elf from that Cap|tivity from which it was hurried, by ca&s;ting it &s;elf again into the Ocean. This happened &s;everal times, whether it was the &s;ame Fi&s;h, we could not well di&s;tingui&s;h: This Relati|on may &s;eem very incredible, but you may have it confirmed by many that venture to the <HI>Indies,</HI> who do often meet upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiny</HI> with &s;uch Wonders of Nature.</P>
<P>Immediatly after this &s;trange &s;ight, we felt the Wind more violent, and &s;aw the Air darken, and fill'd with many threatning Clouds; therefore we prepared for a &s;torm, which did quickly overtake us to our great advantage; for it drave us with &s;uch violence, that we made &s;ix Leagues in an hour with our Main Sail &s;pread: All that day it conti|nued, and was accompanied with &s;uch grievous Rain that I never &s;avv the like in <HI>England:</HI> It vvas fearful to us that had never expo&s;ed our Lives to the Mercy of the Liquid E|lement, e&s;pecially vvhen vve felt our &s;hip crack under us, and the main Ma&s;t bend as a Bovv. But the Evening deli|vered us from all fear; for then a hand&s;om Gale of Wind &s;ucceeded the Tempe&s;t, and di&s;per&s;ed all the fearful Clouds that did &s;urround us, and the &s;etting Sun took his leave of us with a plea&s;ant countenance.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
The next day we &s;aw afar off a Whale &s;pouting Water in|to the Air very high for its Pa&s;time: And about forty Leagues off on this &s;ide of the Southern Cape, we beheld two Ve&s;&s;els cha&s;ing one another; the Wind being North-we&s;t, and they making towards the Land, we could only di&s;cover their Colours; the one was a <HI>Turks</HI> Man of War, the other a <HI>Hamburger;</HI> the <HI>Turk</HI> overtook his Enemy, and then began a furious Fight, which la&s;ted about two hours; the Guns did thunder on both &s;ides, to our &s;atisfaction that were not engaged in the Peril: We could not di&s;cover how they ended their Quarrel, becau&s;e the Chri&s;tian Ship main|tained a running Fight, and made with all Sail towards the &s;hore.</P>
<P>The next morning we had a &s;ight of the Cape St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> otherwi&s;e the Southern Cape, a noted place to all &s;trangers; we were not long ignorant of the Maritine Cu&s;toms of that Place, which were &s;ignified unto us by the Ship-Company, that demanded their u&s;ual Fees from all that had never been there before. Ile a&s;&s;ure you, Sir, the Joy that we did feel at &s;uch a &s;ight, to be &s;o happily e&s;caped out of the danger of the Sea, made us be liberal of our Pur&s;es, and of our &s;trong Drink; for we were not far from <HI>Tangier,</HI> our Landing-Place, which the next day we di&s;covered, and were mo&s;t joyfully received by the Governour and Inhabitants, that cau&s;ed the Eleven Guns of the Town to proclaim our Arri|val.</P>
<P>Before I go from hence, I will give you a &s;hort Account of this Renowned City. It is &s;ituate upon the Decline of a Hill; the Hou&s;es are &s;o built, that from mo&s;t you have a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect into the <HI>Straights Mouth:</HI> It is almo&s;t triangular, and &s;tretches it &s;elf along the Sea &s;hore: A high Hill overlooks the Town on the North-&s;ide, where a &s;trong Ca&s;tle is built capacious enough to hold a thou&s;and or two thou&s;and men in Garri&s;on. <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> fortified it with high Ba&s;tions of &s;quare Stone: Over a|gain&s;t there is a large Bay, where, &s;ome &s;ay, Coral is to be
<PB N="7" REF="5">
found. Round about on the Land-&s;ide &s;everal little Hills do &s;tand that are now fortified with Lines and Forts for fear of the Enemy. A con&s;iderable Compa&s;s of Ground is enclo|&s;ed within the outtermo&s;t Lines. I had the curio&s;ity to take a view of every part of the Town, and its Dependencies. An Officer of my Acquaintance, Mr. <HI>T.</HI> by name, offered him&s;elf to &s;atisfie me: We entred fir&s;t into the Ca&s;tle, and there I took notice of many Stones that did bear the Names of tho&s;e that governed that Province in the time of the <HI>Romans;</HI> the&s;e were fixed in the Wall of the Governors Hou&s;e. Out of the Ca&s;tle I found an old ruined Building, almo&s;t all buried in its own Rubbi&s;h: A little farther, &s;ome ancient Graves cut out of the hard Rock, about four foot broad, and nine in length; by which I di&s;covered the great diminution in the &s;tature of men, that are nothing near &s;o large and &s;o high as in primitive times, Nature &s;till falls into Decay. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Andaluzia</HI> are the lea&s;t men I have ever &s;een; our Boys of twelve years old are higher. I took notice al&s;o thereby of the great care the Ancients had to pre&s;erve their Dead Bodies and A&s;hes from being di&s;mem|bred and di&s;per&s;ed, which doubtle&s;s did proceed from their Belief of a Re&s;urrection. We continued our Walk farther into the Fields, and there I had an excellent Pro&s;pect over all the Works and Forts built by that great Captain for whom <HI>Tangier</HI> may ever mourn; I mean the Renowned Earl of <HI>Tiveot.</HI> My Friend related unto me his unhappy Death, and &s;hewed me be&s;ides, the Wood in which he was kill'd in the company of 600 &s;tout men, with mo&s;t of the Officers of the Garri&s;on. He was a man of great experience in Martial Affairs, having done &s;o good &s;ervice in the <HI>French</HI> Wars, that <HI>Mazarine</HI> appointed unto him during his Life a yearly Pen&s;ion. The occa&s;ion of his Misfortune was this; He had &s;ent into <HI>Portugal</HI> for Lime and Materials for the Fortifications: The Ships being not yet arrived, and that Par|ty of Men that came from the Guard, wanting imployment, he re&s;olved to make &s;ome execution with them upon a Wood
<PB N="8" REF="6">
that did &s;erve as a Retreat unto &s;ome &s;tragling <HI>Moors,</HI> who from thence did kill our Scouts undi&s;covered. In order to their going out, he di&s;patches &s;everal Run-aways of the <HI>Moors,</HI> that lived in the Town, to di&s;cover if any Party was thereabouts to keep Guard. They returned with this in|formation, that no <HI>Moors</HI> were to be &s;een round about the Country, The unfortunate General believes them, yet he had a pre&s;entiment of his misfortune, and &s;pecially be|cau&s;e it was the &s;ame day of the year, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had lo&s;t &s;ix hundred men, ma&s;&s;acred under their Walls by <HI>Gayland</HI> in per&s;on. Therefore he was often heard that morning to &s;ay, Remember, Gentlemen, that this is the Third of <HI>May;</HI> he did di&s;cover &s;ome kind of apprehen&s;ion, which one Major <HI>Knightly</HI> laboured to overcome, by offering him&s;elf to lead out the Party; but he would not be thought to be le&s;s daring than any man, therefore he adventures out, mo&s;t of his men being fitter to encounter with boughs and &s;hrubs than with an Enemy, for they were more armed with Hatchets than with Muskets. He was no &s;ooner advanced into the Wood, but immediately there appear as many <HI>Al|hags</HI> as Trees. <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Army of Foot and Hor&s;e it &s;eems had marched all night from <HI>Alcazor,</HI> and (as &s;ome &s;ay) he had an intention to conclude a Peace. This appearance &s;trook &s;uch a fear into our men, that they minded more how to &s;ave them&s;elves by flight than to fight; but being about three miles from <HI>Tangier,</HI> and many thou&s;and Hor&s;e in the Valley, they were all cut off to three men, who recovered the Sea, and hid them&s;elves in Rocks, until hunger forced them to adventure to <HI>Tangier</HI> again. According to the <HI>Moors</HI> information, &s;ome of our men did fell their lives at a deer rate; about forty rallied in a place where the Hor&s;e could never come, and began &s;uch a de&s;perate fight with the Foot, that filled the Wood, that as many of their men ended their daies as of ours. Had <HI>Gayland</HI> made u&s;e of his Victory, and a&s;&s;aulted the Town, it had yielded without re&s;i&s;tance, the remainder of the Garri&s;on was &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed
<PB N="9" REF="6">
at this Defeat. Our Hor&s;e, it &s;eems, were then Command|ed by an old Souldier that was grown rich, and knew how to &s;ave his own Pate. Therefore they were not concerned in this fight, but as &s;tanders by and lookers on. Had the three Troops advanc'd out of the Lines, they might have &s;a|ved &s;ome of our Men.</P>
<P>My Friend having ended his Relation, we went from the &s;ight of this unhappy place, unto <HI>Charles</HI> Fort, and to the Decline of a Hill, where he told me that &s;ome of our men, to the number of three or four encountred with a Troop of Moors, and took from them their Colours, a Di&s;honour that had never happened to them before in the &s;pace of twen|ty years. We continued our walk round the outtermo&s;t Lines, and there I took notice of the Wi&s;dom and great Skill of my Lord <HI>Tiveot</HI> in the Art of Fortification: Nothing could be better begun, and were it continued, the City might &s;tand in defiance of any Enemy. We had here very plea|&s;ant &s;ights into the neigbouring Valleys that are all covered with the natural Tape&s;try of Flowers and green Gra&s;s; for this is the fir&s;t Spring of the Year, the time that the dry Land of <HI>Africa</HI> yields mo&s;t excellent Herbs fit for all u&s;es. Now when the fir&s;t Rains do fall, I took notice of nothing el&s;e worthy your knowledge, but of a wild Boar of a &s;trange bigne&s;s, a little after the Rain had wet the ground, he was turning it up, to &s;eek for &s;ome dry Roots fit for food; he was at &s;ome di&s;tance from us, yet I could judge him to be a|bout five or &s;ix foot high; a de&s;perate enemy if angered: &s;ince I have encountered &s;ome of a le&s;&s;er &s;ize, and found them to be full of Courage and Strength. We &s;aw al&s;o &s;ome ruined Walls, the ancient Reliques of <HI>Tangier</HI>'s large extent. It reach'd according to all probability, about five or &s;ix miles in length.</P>
<P>My Friend did entertain me with many excellent Relati|ons of the &s;everal Affairs and Tran&s;actions of this Place, which I will re&s;erve for our next Meeting</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not forget one Story that he affirmed to be true,
<PB N="10" REF="7">
and which I had afterwards from other per&s;ons; That in the fatal year of 66, the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> the Dean and Canons of the Cathedral Church of <HI>Tangier</HI> began to rejoyce and to fea&s;t their Friends in the Moneths of <HI>March</HI> and <HI>April,</HI> and being que&s;tioned about this unu&s;ual Mirth, they &s;aid it was becau&s;e the time was now come when <HI>Don Seba&s;tian</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who was reported to have been &s;lain near <HI>Alcazar;</HI> &s;hould return from his wandring up and down <HI>Africa:</HI> And that he &s;hould enter again by the &s;ame Gate that let him out; it is now &s;topt up, at the Ea&s;t end of the City joining to the Sea. This old Tale they did believe &s;o a&s;&s;ured, that &s;everal of them began to prepare an Entertain|ment for his &s;olemn Reception in their Covent, and did &s;hew their Book of Prophe&s;ies to confirm this Belief; but either the&s;e ignorant Fools are mi&s;taken about the time, or the good Prince hath forgot his way home again; for he hath not yet paid them any Vi&s;it that I could hear of.</P>
<P>I had the Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the Mould in the next place: It is thirty yards broad at the top, and it is built about 300, or 350 yards in the Sea: At the end &s;ome great Guns are planted that command the Harbour, and that carry over the Bay. A Story was told to me by the Serjeant of the guard, that will plea&s;e you. About the Moneth of <HI>April</HI> la&s;t in a dark night, about Eleven of the Clock, the Souldiers upon the Guard heard &s;uch fearful Outcries and Shouts, that they were all a&s;toni&s;hed; for it being at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the Town, and &s;uch &s;trict Guards being kept at all the Avenues that none could pa&s;s to them, they could not imagin what was the matter, until there appear'd unto them a great Gi|ant, attended by le&s;&s;er &s;hapes, &s;ome like Men, others like Cats, others like Dogs. The Centry asks <HI>Who's there?</HI> and is an&s;wered with &s;ilence; he threatens Death with his Gun; but the Appearances remained unmoveable until the Serjeant with his Guard was allarm'd with the Centry's angry Speeches; and then they began to dance about, and to offer them many Affronts, and to fill the Air with fearful &s;hrieks
<PB N="11" REF="7">
and Cries a long while. The next morning all the Guard prote&s;ted before the Governour that it was no Illu&s;ion, and that they had been grievou&s;ly di&s;turbed that night; but none would credit their Relation, until the next night, that there happened &s;o violent a &s;torm that 100 yards of the Mould were carried and wa&s;hed away; a thing almo&s;t incredible: The Waves could never have had that power to de&s;troy &s;o much Work, had they not been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome Infernal Spi|rits; for the Stones of the Mould are very large; be&s;ides, the upper are linked together with Iron Bars; but the Iron and all the Art of man was not able to re&s;i&s;t the fury of the Sea and Wind. That va&s;t heap of Stones &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed and &s;etled, was to&s;t away, and carried at a con&s;iderable di|&s;tance. I leave it to you, Sir, to judge of the true cau&s;e of the wonder: You'll give me leave to offer unto you my thoughts, and to tell you how the thing &s;tands: This Ac|cident did a little di&s;courage the Over&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of the Mould, but yet they continue with great re&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ution to repair the breaches that the violence of the Sea hath cau&s;ed; and maugre all the Infernal Spirits, to build in the middle of the Sea a &s;afe Harbour for our Ships I wi&s;h the &s;ucce&s;s may at la&s;t an|&s;wer their expectation and endeavours.</P>
<P>Now you may expect my Judgment of that Place, which I &s;end to you freely: It is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Seat as is in the world; the Air is pure and refined, the Territory good and fruitful, the Climate very moderate, neither too hot nor too cold, by rea&s;on of the continual Brizes or the <HI>Ete&s;iae</HI> Winds that refre&s;h the Air in the heat of Summer. It were to be de&s;ired that &s;uch indu&s;trious and publick &s;pirited per|&s;ons did inhabit there as might make an improvement of the goodne&s;s of the Soil, and of the Conveniencies of the Place. If wine were prohibited, &s;o many of our Engli&s;h Nation had not found here their Graves. Scarce any die here but by Exce&s;s and Intemperance; &s;ome having brought them&s;elves to that capacity of Drinking as that they will make no difficulty to &s;wallow above a Quart of &s;trong

If this reigning Vice and &s;ome others were re&s;train|ed, I doubt not but that City might flouri&s;h in Engli&s;h hands, as much as it hath done in former Ages; for it is one of the anciente&s;t of the world: it was fir&s;t built by the <HI>Canaanites</HI> that fled from the fury of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and &s;ince it hath always been the Chief Place of that Province; the Seat of a Pro-Con&s;ul when <HI>Africa</HI> did &s;ubmit to the Roman Power. It hath been &s;everal times de&s;troyed&punc; in the time of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> an Earthquake overthrew the old Walls, and tumbled them far into the Sea, where they re|main to this day: &s;ince by the <HI>Saracens</HI> or <HI>Arabs</HI> this City was de&s;troyed by the Sword, and all the Inhabitants ma&s;&s;a|cred, becau&s;e it did re&s;i&s;t the Power of the Infidels, and by a Sally that was made, had kill'd the Generals Elde&s;t Son.

<P>We continued here &s;ome few days, and found a kind En|tertainment, e&s;pecially from the Officers, that are mo&s;t ob|liging Gentlemen. But as my Lord's bu&s;ine&s;s was not to pitch his Tents in this place, He di&s;patcht <HI>C. W.</HI> towards the Emperour, with my &s;elf, and another, as well to give notice of His Excellencies arrival, as to procure from him a Pa&s;port, in order to His Journey to <HI>Fez.</HI> We &s;et forward with a Flag of Truce in Our Hands, and were met by 20 Hor&s;e about a Mile from the Lines. The Commander came up to Us fir&s;t, and askt from us our bu&s;ine&s;s; We told him by our Interpreter, that His Imperial Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> had &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;ador to the great Emperour of <HI>Barbary</HI> his Ma&s;ter, a Per&s;on of a very eminent Quality, and of a mo&s;t Illu&s;trious Family, to Treat with him about the Concerns of both Nations. The Captain &s;eemed to &s;u&s;pect the truth of what we had &s;aid, and asked if we had any Letters; We &s;hewed him &s;ome, but would not part with them: at that He was offended, and lead us about a Mile further behind a Hill where we &s;aw 6 Tents erected for Us, and two old Women mi&s;erably deformed, with half a dozen Lancers to Guard them: There was a great Conte&s;t among them at our fir&s;t appearance; and I thought they had intended to u&s;e their Weapons. As &s;oon as the Commander in Chief, (that was a little behind) was come, all was calm again, We laboured to know the rea&s;on of their conte&s;t; and found by our Interpreter, that they were di&s;puting about a Clau&s;e of the Law of <HI>Ma|homet:</HI> both maintaining their different Opinions and Inter|pretations with much eagerne&s;s. The one was not &s;atisfyed to enjoy his own Fancy, but he was re&s;olv'd to impo&s;e it up|on

his Comrade, and make him &s;ubmit unto it by violence. So general is that madne&s;s among&s;t Men, not to allow what Nature cannot refu&s;e a freedom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">f Judgment; and to be &s;o fond of our Opinions, as to di&s;turb the Publick Peace, rather than to &s;uffer them to be contradicted<HI>:</HI> An un&s;ufferable Pride po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es their minds. Every petty Coxcomb would erect a Soveraignty in the invi&s;ible world of our Fancies, and would &s;ee all Men bowing and rendring homage to his Judgement. I'l warrant you if tho&s;e two na&s;ty Moors had but had a little more breeding, and a little more Authority, they would have been content to have made a Schi&s;m about Trifles, and to have endangered Mens lives, in the maintainance of their mi&s;takes. This particular I could not forget, becau&s;e it re|lates to our own condition at home.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the Commander, who&s;e Name was <HI>Zidi Ab|dala,</HI> was entred into the Tents, and that the Di&s;pute was over, We &s;aw them draw a&s;ide, to con&s;ult what &s;hould be done with Us. The Re&s;olution, as we under&s;tood, was, that we &s;hould remain in cu&s;tody, until one was &s;ent to the new Town, to have the Order of <HI>Taffaletta</HI>'s Lientenant that was then there. In the mean while they entertained us with all civility, and pre&s;ented to us their greate&s;t dainties, moi&s;t Chee&s;e, Butter as thick of Goats Hairs, as our Engli&s;h clay Morter with Straw; &s;ome mu&s;ty Bread, and for our de&s;ert we had &s;ome wild Honey; a &s;ad Food to our Engli&s;h Palats. It is like our Engli&s;h French Beans, but black. It grows upon &s;talks every where in the Country wild. I never was in &s;uch a trouble to eat; for our Interpreter advi&s;ed us not to contemn the Moors kindne&s;s by a refu&s;al. We were long at a &s;tand, but He began by his Example to &s;hew us what We &s;hould do: I deceived them all, for with a Cru&s;t of our Engli&s;h Bread, that I pull'd out of my Pocket, I kept my Teeth a going. Our Lodging was an&s;werable to our Diet. Our Bed was the cold Ground, our covering a pitiful Tent, Our Bedfellows &s;tinking Moors; and that which was wor&s;e than all this; it rained all Night upon us, &s;o that the

They ob&s;erve the Spani&s;h gravity in their pro|ceedings with Chri&s;tians. An expre&s;&s;ion of <HI>Grandeur,</HI> that well becomes this mi&s;erable People. About 2 a clock in the afternoon the next Day, We had a few Hor&s;e-men came to us to be our guides to <HI>Salley,</HI> for that was the place unto which we had Order to go. They intended to remain there all Night, becau&s;e We could not reach <HI>Arzilla</HI> that evening, while it was Day; But our earne&s;t entreaties prevailed upon them, for we pretended our bu&s;ine&s;s to require ha&s;t, to oblige them to &s;et forwards; which accordingly they did 6 in num|ber, about 3 a Clock in the afternoon: as it began to be dusky, we came in &s;ight of <HI>Arzilla,</HI> a place &s;cituate upon the Sea &s;hore in a plain Ground; before it there are yet the Ruines of an old Haven, upon which the main Ocean di&s;|charges the fury of its Waves. It yields a plea&s;ant &s;ight afar off; for the Turrets of the Wall are Painted with many cu|rious colours, and many Storks do make their Ne&s;ts upon the Battlements. So that it appears to the ignorant Beholder a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pallace: but We were never &s;o deceived, as when we entred the Gates, and viewed the next day the curio&s;ities of the Town, the greate&s;t was <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Pallace, and the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Arzilla,</HI> that hath the name of being &s;trong. The Pallace is towards the Sea, and like our old Engli&s;h Hou&s;es; there is a little Court at the entrance embelli&s;hed with Paint|ed Tyles of divers colours: at the left hand, a low Gallery with Rails; before it about 20 Foot long, and to broad, where <HI>Gayland</HI> lay in State to receive the Emba&s;&s;adors of Forreign Princes. The good Prince was content it &s;eems with a mean Lodging, the apartments of his Officers were not better.

State. We were here received with more kindne&s;s than Pomp. The Governour came to vi&s;it us, and &s;ent us from his own Table, &s;uch Victuals as he him&s;elf did eat: here I met with &s;everal <HI>Renegadoes,</HI> one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that had been in the Country, He informed us of &s;everal things. One I mu&s;t not omit: Lately when <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Army was routed, and the <HI>Chack</HI> of <HI>Angiers</HI> Son kill'd. The City of <HI>Tetuan</HI> would not &s;ubmit to <HI>Taffaletta</HI>'s Summons, but &s;eemed wil|ling to endure a Siege, but by his Agents in the Town, He did work &s;o effectually upon the Inhabitants, that they open|ed their Gates, and yielded them&s;elves. This good &s;ucce&s;s was followed by the reducement of all the Country, which hath a great dependency upon the Mart Town. <HI>Taffaletta</HI> places there a Governour for him&s;elf, and appoints one of the City to Rule as our Mayors and Bailiffs. This Gover|nour forgetful of his Benefactor, entertain'd &s;ome corre&s;pon|dency with them of <HI>Argiers,</HI> which gave his Ma&s;ter cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that he intended a Revolt. <HI>Taffaletta</HI> having learnt that by his Spies di&s;per&s;ed in all the Cities of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and how he was affected, conceal'd his intentions, and came with a flying Party of Hor&s;e towards <HI>Tetuan.</HI> The Governour hearing of his coming, prepares for his reception, and with a &s;mall company goes out about a League from the Town, to meet his Soveraign Prince. He met him at the head of his Army, attended by all his Great Officers: according to his duty, he alighted, and ki&s;t the Hem of his Garment, a Ce|remony that &s;ignifies as much as the ki&s;&s;ing our Princes Hands. <HI>Muley Ar&s;heid</HI> commands him to mount upon his Hor&s;e; which being done, He comes clo&s;e to him, and with his <HI>Stab,</HI> a de&s;perate Weapon among&s;t the <HI>Moors,</HI> He cuts off his Head, takes it by the hindermo&s;t lock, and there commands all his Army to pa&s;s by, &s;hewing and &s;haking the Head now and then at &s;uch as he &s;u&s;pected of uncon&s;tancy and unfaithfulnes. This is a &s;ign of his great re&s;olution and courage. The &s;ight of this Head did not a little terrify the re&s;t of his <HI>Grandees,</HI> who are become wonderfully faithful to his Intere&s;t.</P>

Immediately after this Execution He goes to <HI>Tetuan,</HI> ac|quaints the People with the Traitors Guilt, and he wanted not the applau&s;es of the fawning <HI>Moors,</HI> that are for him who hath the greate&s;t Power. <HI>Taffaletta</HI> places over the City another Governour, a Per&s;on mo&s;t intimate with Him, be|cau&s;e it was a place of great Importance: He likewi&s;e incurs his di&s;plea&s;ure by &s;ome misfortune, and ended his days &s;oon after his Predece&s;&s;our, in this manner. A Gentleman ac|companied only by two lu&s;ty <HI>Blacks,</HI> comes to <HI>Tetuan,</HI> and asks for the Governour; the People &s;hew him a little Hill, where he was gone to take the Air: thither He comes with all &s;peed, and falutes the Governour, delivering to him &s;ome Letters from the <HI>Sultan;</HI> which were received with all ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Joy. The poor Governour not thinking that his death was &s;o nigh at hand; He invites the Gentleman to his Hou&s;e, and did not &s;o much as dream of the Mi&s;chief prepared for him. All this while the other keeps his de&s;ign &s;ecret, and being entred with the Governour into the Hou&s;e, and &s;at down upon Carpets, as the manner of that Country is; He di&s;cour&s;ed with him about &s;everal Affairs; and at the con|clu&s;ion, when he &s;aw his opportunity, He pulls out of his Pocket a Sentence of Death Signed by <HI>Taffaletta,</HI> which he bid the Governour read. The&s;e unwelcome Lines did &s;trike &s;uch an amazement into his Mind, that he became unmove|able. The other commanded his <HI>Blacks,</HI> that had been care|ful to follow him to the Chamber door, to come in, and do their Office. They pre&s;ently take the Cord that they had prepared on purpo&s;e; and without delay, fall upon him. The mi&s;erable Governour &s;eeing no remedie, begs on his knees the &s;avour to be Strangled with the Sha&s;h about his Middle. That &s;atisfaction was granted unto him Thus he that was intimate with his Prince, and that did &s;latter him&s;elf in his Pro&s;perity, ended his days when he lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected it The Gentleman goes next into the Streets of the City with his naked <HI>Cimeter,</HI> and cau&s;es it to be Proclaimed by his At|tendants:

That the Prince, for ju&s;t cau&s;e, had commanded the Governour to be put to death; and that he was appointed in his &s;tead to Rule in that City, and that if any would op|po&s;e his Reception, that he &s;hould appear. The Citizens ap|proved the Fact, cur&s;ed the dead Governour, and received the new with all Honour.

He could never have ventured to give &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion, had he not been a&s;&s;ured of the <HI>Moors</HI> con|de&s;cention to his Plea&s;ure. I have &s;ince heard at <HI>Fez,</HI> that there is a Cloud that hangs over this Governour of <HI>Tetuan</HI> al&s;o, which may have the &s;ame effect upon him, as upon the former It is certain, <HI>Taffaletta</HI> removes, de&s;troys, &s;trangles, and bani&s;hes all that he &s;u&s;pects in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>We remained one Night in <HI>Arzilla,</HI> and the next Day we Journeyed through the Country called <HI>Elfas,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>the Plow Land;</HI> It reaches as far as one can di&s;cover from <HI>Tan|giers</HI> a great number of little Hills do appear, upon which, and in the Valleys the be&s;t Corn of <HI>Africa</HI> doth grow. It was the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Moors</HI> in <HI>Gayland</HI>'s time, to repair thither from all parts to Plow and Sow, and every one had a cer|tain Portion of Land appointed for him, which he Manured, and at the Harve&s;t he payed only the tenth part to the King, unto whom all the Land belongs. It is a very fruitful Soil in that part, and yields a great increa&s;e, e&s;pecially of Wheat In our Journey this day, which was the mo&s;t plea&s;ant that we ever had we met with &s;ome few Tents, and out of one came forth a little dirty Rogue about 12 years old, cur&s;ing us becau&s;e we were Chri&s;tians; He &s;poke &s;o much <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> as

<P>We arrived that night at <HI>Alcazar, Gayland</HI>'s unhappy City, where he was overcome, and where four of his Wives were taken for the Conqueror's u&s;e: It is an ancient City, &s;uch as the mo&s;t of that Country are; pitiful for the Build|ings: It hath a few Streets that are &s;traight as a Line at both ends. There are Gates joining to the Hou&s;es, I conceive, to defend them from wild Bea&s;ts; for it is not po&s;&s;ible to &s;hel|ter them from Men; the Gates that are at the end of eve|ry Street are like our good great Barn Doors, &s;o old that they can &s;carce hang upon the Hinges. This is that Famous City where three Kings were kill'd in a day, and the Arch Rebel of <HI>Ireland, Stukely,</HI> created by the Pope, Earl of <HI>Wexford,</HI> and Marqui&s;s of <HI>Lein&s;ter,</HI> died al&s;o, with tho&s;e Troops that were intended for the di&s;turbance of Qu. <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s Dominions: But here Divine Ju&s;tice overtook them, and prevented their bloody De&s;igns. We had the Governours Hou&s;e for our Lodging; for it is the Cu&s;tom in all tho&s;e Countries to repair to the Hou&s;e of the Chief Per|&s;on in the Place, who is prepared for your Entertainment; having, as all the Ea&s;tern People, a Gue&s;t-Chamber or Room to keep Strangers dry. Every one brings his own Provi&s;ion with him. There are no publick Hou&s;es of En|tertainment, or Inns; but he that is a man of any e&s;teem, is bound to receive &s;trangers.

<P>We found here very much Civility, when our Bu&s;ine&s;s was known and divulged, many per&s;ons of quality flock'd to|gether to bid us welcome; for this Country de&s;ires nothing more earne&s;tly than to entertain a good corre&s;pondency with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for whom, above all Nations, they have a par|ticular kindne&s;s and a great e&s;teem, becau&s;e their Slaves are &s;o well treated among&s;t us, and becau&s;e we bow not to Images, which they abhor. Among&s;t tho&s;e that did vi&s;it us while we were at Supper, a famous Negromancer came in to &s;ee us, and bid us be of good chear, and that he de&s;ired to &s;hew his re&s;pect to us by a Dance and Mu&s;ick. He had under his Arm a long In&s;trument with a Wire in&s;tead of a String, up|on which he plaid mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly. He had no &s;ooner be|gun, but in &s;teps an ill &s;hap'd Rogue as black as the Devil, followed by a furious Goat and a Dog; the&s;e three began the Dance, the Goat and Dog &s;triking the Ground accord|ing to the &s;ound of the In&s;trument. The Sport had been plea&s;ant, had we not been informed by a Stander by that the&s;e &s;hapes were not real, but that they were Devils or E|vil Spirits that did thus appear at his Command. This Fan|cy did make us de&s;ire that the Pa&s;time would end a little &s;ooner than otherwi&s;e we would have done. The Negro|mancer perceived it; therefore he concluded; and all the&s;e Appearances vani&s;h'd to our Eyes, the Door being then &s;hut, leaving &s;uch a horrible Stench as made us all ri&s;e to &s;eek the open Air to breath; Which the Negromancer laboured to excu&s;e, telling us we had affronted his Devils, by expre&s;|&s;ing a Di&s;like of their Kindne&s;s, and therefore we might thank our &s;elves if they had left &s;uch an ill Sent to puni&s;h our Contempt: We told him by our Interpreter, that we did not de&s;ire &s;uch Entertainment, and that the Devils Company was never grateful to us. This Accident made us fall to our

Prayers, and be more devout than otherwi&s;e we &s;hould have been: We afterwards inquired what this Fellow was; &s;ome told us, that his Name was <HI>Zidi Lamed,</HI> a man highly e|&s;teemed among&s;t the <HI>Moors</HI> becau&s;e of his Art in Negro|mancy, and his Acquaintance with Familiar Spirits, by which he knows the News of all the world, and foretels ma|ny things to the People which they are de&s;irous enough to know; &s;o that he is con&s;ulted as an Oracle in all urgent oc|ca&s;ions. There are many that &s;tudy the Black Art, but this man was the mo&s;t eminent. As he went from us, he let fall &s;ome threatning words, which we did not under&s;tand till the next day, that we all fell from our Hor&s;es and brui&s;ed our &s;elves. That night we forgot not to &s;ay our Prayers, and to recommend our &s;elves to Gods Protection. And a&s;&s;oon as it was day we departed towards <HI>Saley,</HI> and that night we came to the Mountain called <HI>I&s;tibel,</HI> where one <HI>Beleif</HI> com|mands, as being his Inheritance; I &s;hould be too tedious to write every Accident that happened to us in the way. Our next Stage was <HI>Sar&s;ar</HI> upon the River <HI>Sbom,</HI> where one of our Guides, a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Renegado &s;hewed me the Place where a great Battel had been fought between <HI>Gayland</HI> and <HI>Ham del Hag,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Bembouqua;</HI> in which he told me he did fight for <HI>Gayland,</HI> and was pre&s;ent during the En|counter. The two Princes were at variance for their Limits, which cau&s;ed them to expo&s;e the Lives of their Subjects, and to give many Battels: this that was fought upon the Banks of the River <HI>Sbow,</HI> was a bloudy one, and fatal to <HI>Bembou|qua</HI>'s Intere&s;t through his own eagerne&s;s; for he being with his Hor&s;e and Foot beyond the River, ventured over to charge the Enemy; <HI>Gayland</HI> keeping his men clo&s;e, expecting his Coming, at la&s;t he gave &s;uch a furious On&s;et, that the <HI>San|to</HI>'s men gave back with much lo&s;s; notwith&s;tanding the Ge|nerals Courage rallies them and brings them on again; here Victory was long uncertain; &s;ometimes one Party flies, &s;ometimes the other; and had it not been for a fre&s;h Supply of Men led on by <HI>Gayland</HI>'s &s;econd Brother, which came at

This Succe&s;s of <HI>Gayland</HI> cau&s;ed many of the Saints Subjects to revolt to him, and to &s;et up his Banner in their &s;everal Juri&s;dictions: So that he became by this Battel a mo&s;t powerful Prince, very dreadful to his Neigh|bours. This happened in the Year 1663.</P>
<P>By the way as we pa&s;&s;ed, we had a &s;ight of &s;everal <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garri&s;ons upon the Sea-&s;ide: <HI>Larache,</HI> where <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Power received a very great check by a handful of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who made &s;uch a brisk Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">y upon them, that they kill'd a good number of his Men, took <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Brother, and hang'd him up upon their Walls: A bold Action! that ren|dred them odious to the Country and to <HI>Gayland;</HI> &s;o that he never would have any peace with them.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Mammora,</HI> a noted place in <HI>Spain;</HI> for there they bani&s;h the malefactors. As we were over again&s;t this Gari&s;on, our Company being advanced a little before, there happened an Accident that &s;car'd me more than it hurt me, a Hor&s;eman having &s;poken with our Guides, who told him our bu&s;ine&s;s, and who we were, came up to me, having but one Moor with me, and brandi&s;h'd his Lance as he rid tilt at me; I under&s;tood not his meaning, and thought he had intended Mi&s;chief, yet I was afraid to di&s;cover my Fear, and therefore I would not put my&s;elf upon a po&s;ture of De|fence till I felt his Weapon; but I was &s;urpriz'd, when in &s;tead of a Blow with his Lance, which I expected, &s;eeing
<PB N="23" REF="13">
him gallopping at me, he mo&s;t dexterou&s;ly turn'd the Point, and laid the other end upon the Pommel of my Saddle; a great expre&s;&s;ion of Civility and Kindne&s;s among&s;t them, as I under&s;tood by our Interpreter; re&s;igning by that Action, the Weapon&punc; into the hands of him whom they treat in that manner: When I &s;aw his Intentions were not evil, I &s;alu|ted him according to our fa&s;hion: after a little Di&s;cour&s;e with the Moor, he went his way, and I made up to my Com|pany.</P>
<P>We came through the Country of <HI>Elhalat,</HI> a Plain Ground, &s;o named from that Tribe that dwells there, and within three days we arrived at <HI>Saley:</HI> The City &s;tands very plea&s;antly; it is divided into two parts, a River pa&s;&s;ing in the middle of the City. It is two Miles about, having a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle at one end, with a &s;curvy Harbour for Ships before it. We were led directly to the Governours Hou&s;e, where we met with a kind entertainment, e&s;pecially <HI>C. W.</HI> who was well known to the Town. Here we found many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Slaves, taken in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bottoms by the Py|rates of this place; &s;ome were newly brought in. We gave them all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance our Pur&s;es or Favour could afford, and put them in &s;ome hopes to obtain their Freedom, if my Lord was &s;o happy as to obtain a firm Peace, a joyful news to tho&s;e poor wretches, that had left all hopes of returning home to their beloved Soil.</P>
<P>Here we remained &s;ome days, viewing the ancient Mo|numents of the Town, that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Arabs.</HI> And here we took notice of the mi&s;erable condition of the <HI>Barba|rians.</HI> There are a great number of them in the Country round about, di&s;per&s;ed up and down. The <HI>Arabians</HI> are their Lords, having Power of Life and Death over them. Each <HI>Arab</HI> hath his particular Servants that he &s;ends to Till his Ground, and from him requires &s;o much Tribute either in Corn or Money every year. Sometimes he rides about
<PB N="24" REF="14">
to view his Territories, and then his Tenants are bound to provide him with all nece&s;&s;aries: Be&s;ides, he takes from them what he plea&s;es, and Sells them and their Family, and di&s;po&s;es the poor <HI>Brabbers</HI> as he li&s;ts. For as the <HI>Arabians</HI> are entred into the Country by way of Conque&s;t, they ac|cordingly behave them&s;elves there as Conquerors, treating the Inhabitants as Slaves and Captives. But at the death of the la&s;t King, they freed them&s;elves from the <HI>Arabian</HI> Ty|ranny, and under the Conduct of &s;everal Princes did &s;ubdue the <HI>Arabians</HI> them&s;elves. <HI>Gayland, Bembouqua,</HI> and &s;everal others, had many &s;ucce&s;sful Battles with the <HI>Arabs,</HI> their Ma&s;ters, for near Twenty years; and becau&s;e of &s;ome Divi|&s;ions among&s;t them, and that their Lawful Prince was &s;lain, they could not recover their former E&s;tate, until <HI>Taffaletta</HI>'s late Victories over the <HI>Barbarians, Gayland,</HI> and the re&s;t. When the Governour of this place was acquainted with Our bu&s;ine&s;s, He freely gave us a Pa&s;s through his Government, for he commands much of the Country round about almo&s;t as far as <HI>Fez;</HI> unto which City, We &s;et forward next through a Tribe of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> called <HI>Mouktar;</HI> and by the way we de&s;ired to know the meaning of &s;everal Pillars and Monuments; Our Guards told us, that they were &s;et up by the Army of the <HI>Arabians</HI> that came from the Ea&s;t, when they over ran this Country, in memory of &s;ome &s;ignal Battles given in tho&s;e places again&s;t the Inhabitants; for as among&s;t the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> they give Names to &s;everal places, according to the accidents that happen there. We thus pa&s;t without any mole&s;tation, being &s;ometimes obliged to &s;hew our Pa&s;port to the Chief Men. As we were come about 10 Leagues on this &s;ide of <HI>Fez;</HI> We pa&s;t through a delicate Champaign Ground, over fruitful for &s;uch lazy Inhabitants as the <HI>Moors.</HI> In a plea&s;ant Valley about 2 Leagues further, We pa&s;&s;ed by above a thou&s;and Tents, di&s;tingui&s;ht by their &s;everal Fami|lies, which were &s;eparated at &s;ome convenient di&s;tance, round about many thou&s;and head of Cattle were a feeding. Now the&s;e that live in Tents are the <HI>Arabs,</HI> the People that came
<PB N="25" REF="14">
from <HI>Arabia</HI> by the &s;ollicitation of the ancient <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who made u&s;e of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to recover his Dominions from an U&s;urper, that in his ab&s;ence had revolted from him; &s;ince they have over-&s;pread all this Country: and as their manner is, they live in Tents, and as the <HI>Nomades</HI> remove from place to place with all their Sub&s;tance. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;everal great Tribes, as the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> who&s;e Brethren they are: for they are the <HI>Sara|cens, Aagarens,</HI> or <HI>I&s;hmaelites,</HI> or the Po&s;terity of <HI>I&s;hmael,</HI> the Son of <HI>Abraham.</HI> Their manner of living may be a very good Commentary to &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages of the Old Te&s;tament. The chief Tribes are named <HI>Heldauquella, &V;le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">de&s;ees, Spenet, Elholot, Mouktar, Shregga, Hiaina, Soubba, Dama, Them&s;na, Hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">eela, Elanyad,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The&s;e are divided into Families, Governed by the fir&s;t born, who hath a jurisdiction over the &s;everal Members. They have all a dependency upon him, and received from him their livelihood. He is their Captain in War, their Fa|ther in Peace, their Judge when any difference ari&s;es in his Precinct. Therefore, all their Tents do keep clo&s;e to him; His Tent is planted We&s;terly, being bigger and hand&s;omer than the re&s;t: then the others are erected on both Hands, as a half Moon, open towards the Ea&s;t, a&s;wel that they might &s;alute the Ri&s;ing Sun, for whom they have a great Reverence, as that they might look towards <HI>Mecha,</HI> the place of <HI>Maho|met</HI>'s Birth, for which al&s;o they have a particular Devotion. In the middle of the Tents, there is one which is appointed for their Meeting to Prayer. This Barbarous People have that good In&s;tinct to &s;et apart a place for the Wor&s;hip of God. Where there are many hundred Tents together, a Prie&s;t al&s;o, had in great e&s;teem among&s;t them, is &s;et a part for that Service; unto &s;ome they appoint 100 Dollers, to &s;ome more, to others le&s;s, according to their Number. His Office is to Read Prayers 5 times a day, unto which he calls the People, &s;tanding at the Door of the Tent with his <HI>Alla illa Mahomet re&s;ul all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>

and many other expre&s;&s;ions of Humility and Devotion: His Office al&s;o is to teach the Children to Read and Write <HI>Ara|bick,</HI> and to in&s;truct them in the Law of <HI>Mahomet.</HI> An excellent Cu&s;tom, but ill applyed. By that means, the&s;e <HI>Talouts,</HI> for that is their names, do render them&s;elves &s;er|viceable, and do train up their Children in awe and re&s;pect of their Order, and of Religion, Imprinting in their tender minds tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions, as may make them for ever faithful to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and his Intere&s;t. That is the cau&s;e that every one is &s;o Devout, and that Prophane&s;s finds &s;uch little enter|tainment among&s;t them. It were to be wi&s;ht that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy would practice the &s;ame Cu&s;tom, and take into their tuition the Children of their &s;everal Pari&s;hes; We might then hope that the next Generation of Men would be le&s;s Athei&s;tical and Vitious, and more Devoted to the Service of God, and their Prince. Their con&s;tant Preaching &s;hould not hinder the Catechizing of Youth&punc; I am &s;ure that would be the means to expel Ignorance which reigns in Cities, and Country. It would al&s;o be the means to &s;ettle their Intere&s;t in the Kingdom, and to rai&s;e their Holy Order in the e&s;teem and favour of the People, from whence (it is unhappily fallen by their own mi&s;carriages. Be&s;ides, the&s;e ordinary &s;ort of Prie&s;ts, there are others called <HI>Elftees,</HI> Itinerary Preachers, who are e&s;teemed Learned in the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Law; the&s;e do upon the Solemn Days, and when they are required, a&s;cend up into a Pulpit, and there they Expound a Text of the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> It is wonderful to &s;ee the Veneration, and the re&s;pect that is paid to the&s;e Men. There is nothing too precious for them, no company too Honourable. They are lookt upon as &s;o many Gods among&s;t the People, and re|ceived with the greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of love and kindne&s;s. I did often wi&s;h that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Clergy were as happy as the&s;e Men. But that may be de&s;ired, but never expected in our days.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="15">
Several other &s;orts there are; &s;ome called <HI>Hages,</HI> or <HI>Saints;</HI> they are tho&s;e that have vi&s;ited <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb. Of their other Orders &s;everal have written. Now the chief of every Family appoints a <HI>Thaloub,</HI> to in&s;truct his People, and Pray for them. If any difference ari&s;es between them, or any injury be done, they come before Him: His Sentence is a Law to them; &s;o great is the priviledge of the fir&s;t born. They have no Judges, but in Cities: Tho&s;e that live in Tents, do &s;ubmit to the plea&s;ure of their Chieftain. I &s;aw a Fellow, that in his anger had &s;tab'd his Comerade in the Belly; the Wound was not &s;o Mortal, but he came immediately before the chief of the Family; who pre&s;ently ordred him to be &s;ent for, to pay for his Cure, and 10 Dollers be&s;ides; and then taking a &s;ound Stick, commanded him to lie upon his Belly; which was immediately done, then he gave him 10 blowes upon his Breech. The Fellow having receiv'd his Puni&s;hment, made a profound Reverence, and &s;eemed to be as contented as ever, only for his 10 Dollers; He de&s;ired his Party to compound with him. Another had &s;tollen a Hen from a <HI>Thaloub,</HI> with &s;ome other trifles: the crime being known, He was &s;ent for, and all the &s;tollen Goods, that weighed about 20 Pounds, were hung at his Ears, through which wide holes were made, and he condemned to &s;tand thus at the entry of their <HI>Mo&s;que;</HI> or Tent con&s;ecrated to Prayer. I have &s;een many other Puni&s;hments of the like nature inflicted. Their ordinary is the <HI>Ba&s;tinado</HI> for &s;mall offences; <HI>Empalling</HI> for grievous; and for &s;ome they Burn, they Hang, Strangle, and Poy&s;on. There is another manner of Execution very &s;trange; they put a Fellow naked, only &s;omthing about his middle to hide the Privity, which they can never abide to behold. They &s;hackle his Feet, &s;o that he may only go and then they let loo&s;e upon him the Boys and Chil|dren, who with their &s;harp Canes, do make him bleed to death, pricking him, till he gives up the Gho&s;t: this is the mo&s;t cruel death practi&s;ed among&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="16">
One thing I cannot forget of their Cu&s;toms. If any kills another, the next Brother or the next Kin&s;man is bound to &s;eek the Murderer out, and to kill him where ever he meets him; Be&s;ides, they &s;wear to maintain their Captains, and to die in their Quarrels. So that one Company of Tents many times do fall out with another. For they are di&s;po&s;ed of in the Country of &s;o many little Villages, making the appear|ance of a Town.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Arabs,</HI> by what I have &s;aid, you may perceive that they hate the Government of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and love a free Life. Since the la&s;t Emperour of <HI>Morocco</HI> that was Ma&s;&s;acred by his Servants, never any had any rule over them, but they maintained a kind of an <HI>Ari&s;tocracy</HI> among&s;t them&s;elves, until <HI>Muley Ar&s;heid</HI> ca&s;t him&s;elf into their Protection, when he fled from his elder Brother <HI>Muley Mehammed.</HI> He be|haved him&s;elf &s;o bravely, and did ingratiate him&s;elf &s;o cun|ningly with them, that they made him fir&s;t their General, or Great <HI>Moukadem.</HI> In which Imployment he had won|derful Succe&s;s again&s;t the Ea&s;t <HI>Arabs:</HI> a People that cannot endure the We&s;t. After he led them again&s;t his elder Bro|ther, and enriched many of them with Plunder and Spoil. That made them proceed to this Election, in which he was &s;o happy, that all con&s;ented to make him their King or Em|perour. This was his fir&s;t ri&s;e after the death of his elder Brother, that he took Pri&s;oner, and then kill'd. The chief of the Kingdom of <HI>Taffaletta</HI> made him al&s;o their Soveraign Prince. He hath a younger Brother named <HI>Muley Zidan,</HI> and that he might oblige the People to a greater obedience, and more fidelity, he hath given out, that he is of the Race of their Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and that acording to that Law none ought to Command in Chief, but one lineally de&s;cend|ed from <HI>Mahomet.</HI> This Per&s;wa&s;ion prevails much upon the &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Moors,</HI> and di&s;ables them from re&s;i&s;ting or op|po&s;ing his proceedings, for fear of their Prophet, makes

them revolt from their former Governours, and &s;ubmit to his Dominion. He hath Conquered all <HI>Gayland</HI>'s Country, and the Territories of <HI>Bembouqua,</HI> called <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> Mehamed, Boubquer del <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ago,</HI> the King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> who had been an U&s;urper. The Kingdom of <HI>Sous,</HI> the Countries where the&s;e Tribes do dwell, <HI>Them&s;na, Heldedla, Moukter, Hiania, Widlobar, Elangad, Heldouquella, Uleidezin, Dama,</HI> and many more; all making up 43 Tribes, with the Country of <HI>Hel I&s;hbel:</HI> All the&s;e Kingdoms and Places do acknowledge him for their Prince. Only &s;ome Petty Lords of the Craggy Mountains do re&s;i&s;t his Power. Again&s;t the&s;e he is now marched with his Army, and as we hear, hath reduced &s;ome to Obedience, having executed great Numbers of them in a cruel manner&punc; to terrifie the re&s;t. The&s;e are <HI>Barbari,</HI> the ancient Inhabitants of that Country, who have been forced to &s;ubmit to the yoke of the <HI>Arabians;</HI> yet in the&s;e latter days they were become Ma&s;ters over them, and did u&s;e them very hardly when their la&s;t Emperour was kill'd; for then they fell into Divi&s;ions. <HI>Alcaide I&s;&s;a,</HI> a great man among&s;t them, commanded the chief of their Tribes: Next was <HI>Zidi Douckag,</HI> with <HI>Zidi Boumhedi.</HI> All three had under them <HI>Sheirs,</HI> Governors of Tribes, that they had ingaged in their Parties; but when they fell out a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, <HI>Bembouqua</HI> that commanded the great Country called <HI>Heli&s;hbel</HI> and <HI>Fez,</HI> where the <HI>Barbarians</HI> do live, took the advantage, and made War upon the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and reduced them to Obedience, u&s;ing them in the &s;ame manner as they did before his People, as &s;o many Slaves; which made them put them&s;elves more willingly under one Head, that by his means they might free them&s;elves from the <HI>Barbarian</HI> Bondage. The Ca&s;e here is much like that of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> by <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI>'s means they conquered <HI>Canaan,</HI> and did domineer over the Inhabitants; but tho&s;e of the Sea Coa&s;t could not be driven out: when therefore they &s;aw an opportunity, they did revenge them&s;elves upon the Po&s;terity of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> until <HI>I&s;rael</HI> made <HI>Saul</HI> their King,
<PB N="30" REF="17">
and after him <HI>David;</HI> then they returned to their former Com|mand over the Inhabitants &amp; the Country round. Thus is it with their Brethren the <HI>Arabs;</HI> they conquered all this Country, and made the Inhabitants bear the Yoke; but &s;ometimes tho&s;e that live in &s;trong Places and high Mountains, do revolt from them, and give them no little di&s;turbance, as they have done in the&s;e late years under &s;everal great Command|ers. A memorable Battel was given about <HI>Saley</HI> between them, where ten or twelve thou&s;and <HI>Arabians</HI> were killed, and their Families and Cattel taken by <HI>Bembouqua</HI> at the Ri|ver <HI>Widlobar.</HI></P>
<P>Now the&s;e <HI>Arabians</HI> do never mingle them&s;elves with the <HI>Brabbers,</HI> thinking them&s;elves an abler Generation of men; neither doth one Tribe mix with another: they ob&s;erve in that the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> At the Divi&s;ion of the Land, they had for every Tribe a parcel of Ground appointed, in which they live up and down in their Tents, never going with their Cattel out of their own Limits, unle&s;s &s;ome urgent occa&s;ion calls them; as when they fight: Then all the Tribes join, and form an Army: over which they elect a General. Now every Tribe keeps a Record of all the Members of Per&s;ons that do belong unto it, and therefore every one is able to give an account of his Ance&s;tor; All the Royal Blood pretends to be come from <HI>Haly, Mahomet</HI>'s Son in Law. The <HI>Ara|bians</HI> acknowledge none other for Prince, but he that is be|lieved to be thus de&s;cended. <HI>Taffaletta</HI> or <HI>Muley Ar&s;heid</HI> is &s;o; his Ance&s;tors have long commanded in the Kingdom of <HI>Taffalet,</HI> being entred there with the Conque&s;t of that Coun|try.</P>
<P>In our Journey to <HI>Fez,</HI> we met with many thou&s;and <HI>A|rabs</HI> removing with their Sub&s;tance from place to place, and they were the Tribes of <HI>&V;laidezin Dama Saubba,</HI> among&s;t whom we lodged one night; and were invited by one of the <HI>Sheirs</HI> to Supper: We had a Table &s;pread with all the Va|riety

You may expect an account of this City; but that I re&s;erve for &s;ome other time, when I can write to you. I think this Letter is long enough to weary your Patience.

<P><HI>_AFrica</HI> yields mo&s;t excellent things fit for the u&s;e of man: The Ground may di&s;pute in Fruitfulne&s;s with any part of <HI>Europe:</HI> it only wants Rain to moderate the heat of the Climate; when the &s;howers come, eve|ry where green Herbs appear among&s;t the drie&s;t Sand. Here are excellent Simples &s;it for Phy&s;ick. It hath often been ob&s;erved that many Creatures when offend|ed by their Enemy, and wounded, have &s;ought after &s;ome of the&s;e Herbs that are proper to cure and heal them; Gods Providence hath therefore planted that part of the world with &s;uch good and healing Roots as might oppo&s;e the Malice, and prevent the Mi&s;chiefs of Venomous Creatures, whereof here are a great number, e&s;pecially in the Land; and in the Woods there are great Numbers of Scorpions as black as a Coal, Serpents that ca&s;t them&s;elves from Trees and &s;urprize and wound the unwary Pa&s;&s;enger. Here are venomous A&s;pes, who&s;e lea&s;t touch brings pre&s;ent death, let it be never &s;o &s;mall; for it conveys its Poi&s;on &s;ecretly into the Veins, through the lea&s;t wound, and that infects the next bloud; thus the In|fection &s;preads by degrees until it reaches the heart.

There is al&s;o another kind that cau&s;|eth a pre&s;ent drine&s;s in the Palate a&s;&s;oon as it hath wounded the man, and therefore called by the Ancients <HI>Dip&s;as.</HI> The Inhabitants &s;peak of a new &s;ort of Creature that they &s;ee al|mo&s;t every Year; for when all the Creatures do come to the fre&s;h Springs and Fountains, the heat carries them to unna|tural Copulation, and from the&s;e extraordinary Conjuncti|ons do proceed Mon&s;ters that are of &s;everal Species, which have not the power to propagate or to increa&s;e. Beyond the City of <HI>Fez</HI> there is a great Wilderne&s;s full of wild Bea&s;ts and Fowls. The <HI>Arabs</HI> do live in all the fruitful places; but in the Land nothing is to be &s;een but Mountains of Sand, that are very dreadful in a &s;torm of Wind, becau&s;e it carries and tran&s;ports them from place to place, and buries the Pa&s;|&s;enger under the weight of it alive. The Commodities of this Countrey are very many; it were a happy thing to have a Prince there that did command all the Land, and that were a Lover of Trade; then <HI>Carovans</HI> might go &s;afe from place to place without fear of robbing: But the nature of the <HI>A|rabs</HI> inclines them to thieving and violence; &s;o that although one &s;hould have a Pa&s;port from the Prince, it is a great ha|zard, if you be not provided with a good Guard, that you will be &s;et upon by the&s;e Rogues, who are notwith&s;tanding, in their e&s;teem, the be&s;t Gentlemen, and the noble&s;t in the World. The chief Commodities are Hides, they kill as many wild Bulls and Cows in the Land, as they of the <HI>Ea&s;t&punc;Indies</HI> do in their Plantations. Be&s;ides Goat-skins, <HI>Marok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> or <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Leather, that are excellent, here is great &s;tore of Honey; the Bees do increa&s;e in the Woods and Mountains, and as there are excel|lent Flowers that grow in all the Valleys, &s;o naturally the Country is full of Bees and Wax. There is al&s;o a kind of Silk Stuffe that is made by the Inhabitants of the Sea-&s;hore, of the Bark of Trees. Here is al&s;o Raw Silk; the Countrey breeds &s;ilk-Worms in great abundance about <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Mo|rocco.</HI> Here are many other things u&s;eful to the life of man,

if Peace were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Country, and with our Na|tion, then we might fetch from <HI>Guiny,</HI> and the <HI>Negro's</HI> Country, the rich commoditie of Gold du&s;t.</P>
<P>Now every Month &s;ome of the <HI>Blacks</HI> do adventure to <HI>Fez,</HI> with Camels loaden with that &s;uperfluous Earth, of which they have too much, and carry back other trifles that are e&s;teemed among&s;t them. Some &s;ay that the Sun hath burnt the Sand of the Wilderne&s;s in &s;ome places, and that it is become perfect Gold. It is certain, that in the Sandy De|&s;arts the <HI>Blacks</HI> do gather up Gold; This Gold is the be&s;t in the World, it is as pliable almo&s;t as Paper, and doth not &s;o ea&s;ily con&s;ume and wa&s;te. If &s;ome would adventure in the Land, to &s;earch out the Country, and bring a ju&s;t and a true Report, he might di&s;cover many things which our Traders might improve to their advantage. In the Wilderne&s;s there are great &s;tore of wild A&s;&s;es, Hor&s;es, Lions, Jaccals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is wonderful of this la&s;t, that &s;mells a dead Carka&s;e many Miles; and towards the Night, they run howling out of their Dens and Caves in great numbers right to the place where lies their Prey. The Lions and Leopards, and other furious Creatures are pre&s;ently awakened with the noi&s;e, and there|fore they follow them always. A Jaccal is a kind of a Fox, bigger and longer, ju&s;t of the &s;ame &s;hape, but for the mo&s;t part of a blacki&s;h Gray, as high as a good Ma&s;tiff Dog. In the Night they &s;urround the Tents of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and if they meet any di&s;-armed, he &s;erves to &s;atisfie their hunger; for then &s;uch a company do over power him, that he is over|come, and torn in pieces in a moment. Here are al&s;o many Apes and Baboons. The Apes do dwell in Forre&s;ts and Woods on the tops of Trees: Sometimes they venture down in the Valleys in Troops, 6 or 7 hundred at a time, and do a con&s;iderable execution upon the poor Corn. Many are undone by this &s;curvy Vermin. They never &s;u&s;pect the come|ing of any Creature, but pre&s;ently &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;light at the lea&s;t di&s;covery or appearance of Man or Bea&s;t&punc; It is remarkable, what hath been ob&s;erved of them, that he that

comes fir&s;t to a Tree, he skips, and &s;eizes upon a bow, which he labours to bend to the Ground, then all his com|panions do follow, and run upon the Tree over his Back that comes fir&s;t to the place. Here are many &s;trange In&s;ects, and Birds of divers colours. There is one remarkable, that our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call a <HI>Bee eater;</HI> It is Red, Blew, White, Yellow, Green, and very hand&s;omely painted with divers colours: It appears in the Months of <HI>April, May, June, July,</HI> the hotte&s;t Months of the Year. They pur&s;ue the &s;warms of Bees, and devour them, and have a cry much like a Frogg. They dwell in the Land during the Rains, and come to the Sea-coa&s;t in Summer &amp; Spring. Here are al&s;o excellent Roots, that are brought from the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies</HI> to us, &s;uch as do fill the Shops of our Druggi&s;ts. Were that Country in the hands of an ingenious and laborious People; it is not to be doubted, but that it would furni&s;h the re&s;t of the World with excellent Productions: But &s;ince the Conque&s;t of the Country by the <HI>Arabs,</HI> War and Oppre&s;&s;ions have hindred the Inhabi|tants from the improvement of their Soil.</P>
