Al&s;o you im|pute the cau&s;e of this combu&s;tion of warre wholly vnto Vs.</P>
<P>We had not thought that your Memory could &s;o much haue failed your Maie&s;ty, as to put in Obliuion &s;o many attempts lately undertaken again&s;t vs. For ex|ample, how your field-mar&s;hall came vpon vs in <HI>Pru&s;sia</HI> with a compleat army both of Hor&s;e and Foote, your Eagl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">n En&s;ignes di&s;played, &amp; that vnexpectedly.

In&s;omuch that you cannot accu&s;e vs to be the occa&s;ion or cau&s;e of this warre enterpri&s;ed. For nece&s;&s;ity compells vs to a&s;+&s;ure our owne State at this pre&s;ent, and to wage battaile and rai&s;e forces for our owne &s;urety and &s;afety.</P>
<P>Wherefore it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity follow, that wee are
<PB N="2" REF="3"> excu&s;able in this matter. The rather becau&s;e wee haue made knowne in writing, at two &s;euerall times, as al&s;o declared through our Emba&s;&s;adors, both to the Electors of the Empire &amp; your Generals, that in ca&s;e the&s;e intol|lerable Injuries, &amp; enimicitiall abu&s;es did not cea&s;e, nor were remedied we &s;hould nece&s;&s;arily be con&s;trained, by other lawfull meanes to disburden our &s;elues, and en&s;ure our &s;elues and our e&s;tate. For it is ea&s;ily to be gue&s;&s;ed at, what your warlike preparations doe tend too, euen by your daily enterpri&s;es. Al&s;o the Countrey of <HI>Po|merania</HI> and tho&s;e Prouinces, by wofull experience can too to well te&s;tifie, by their exce&s;&s;iue lo&s;&s;e and &s;uf|fering, what may be expected from your proceeding, although we had neuer ey'd the matter.</P>
<P>If your Imperiall Maie&s;tie obiect, that the&s;e differen|ces might haue beene moderated and allayed, without &s;uch mi&s;erable turmoiles and warlike proceeding, wee cannot but willingly grant; But euen then, and vpon that occa&s;ion you di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and reiected out Commit|ties and Deputies again&s;t all right, rea&s;on, and mode&s;ty, when they appeared at the City of <HI>Lubeck.</HI> For than we were fully re&s;olued to end all manner of di&s;&s;ention, and to come to an accord and hone&s;t agrement.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, your owne Army hath proclaimed vs, (or at lea&s;t) declared vs open Enemies, becau&s;e they &s;hewed all manner of ho&s;tility, and manife&s;t enmity a|gain&s;t vs and ours. As for the pre&s;ent, true it is, you profer vs a treatie of peace (conditionally that we will abandon and lay downe our Armes) when as now the wound is growne incurable, and the rent is torne &s;o great, that 'tis pa&s;t mending. For now we cannot any longer e&s;teeme of the&s;e emminent dangers, as meere
<PB N="3" REF="3"> imaginations and fanta&s;ies, but mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of reall injuries, when as both by Sea and Land We are palpa|bly a&s;&s;aulted, and groane vnder the&s;e kind of grievan|ces. Wherefore you &s;hall excu&s;e Vs, that Wee will no longer tru&s;t to your meerely Verball promi&s;es, but are re&s;olued to entertaine and keepe our Armies in our owne hands, &s;o long till we &s;hall be a&s;&s;ured of a faire Peace, and faithfull agreement.</P>
<P>If therefore in the meane time you &s;hall re&s;olue, and deeme fitting (as in your writing you doe intimate) to afford all your endeavour and be&s;t ayde and a&s;&s;i&s;tance toward the conducting of the Barque of whole Chri|&s;tendome (which now a long time hath beene to&s;&s;ed on the waues of Warre and turbulencie) to the hauen of Peace and tranquilitie, and to that end enter in a Treaty of con&s;onant agreement, You &s;hall find Vs no way re|fractorie, but in euery kind mo&s;t tractable and inclining to &s;o de&s;ireable and whole&s;ome expedition.</P>

That at the taking of <HI>Griffenhagen</HI> and <HI>Gartz,</HI> his Maie&s;tie hath obtained aboue 60. pieces of Ordnance and much munition, it is much to be admired that the Imperiall Army neere vnto <HI>Gartz,</HI> did not bid the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Army head, &s;ince they were 15000. &s;trong.
