<HEAD>A PREFACE, FOR THE Under&s;tanding of <HI>Circles, Zones, Parallels, Degrees</HI> of <HI>Longi|tude,</HI> and <HI>Latitude, Climates,</HI> and other nece&s;&s;ary Things, in the De&s;cription of the U|niver&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we come to a par|ticular Recital of the Six Voyages which I have made during 14 or 15 Years in di|vers Places of <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> I think 'twill not be much ami&s;s (for the more clear Un|der&s;tanding thereof) to &s;peak briefly, by way of Preface, &s;omething of the
<PB REF="5">
Four Parts of the World, and of cer|tain Principles appertaining to the Sphere, and Geography, to the end that the Reader may the more ea&s;ily apprehend &s;uch things as he &s;hall find di&s;per&s;ed here and there in the&s;e my Writings; laying down for certain and nece&s;&s;ary Maxims &s;everal things which I &s;hould otherways have been con&s;train'd, too often, to repeat; tho' but touching as it were upon what might be &s;aid of this Science, the more exact Re&s;earch, and Knowledge of which, I leave to tho&s;e who make Profe&s;&s;ion thereof, and who are more Learned therein than my &s;elf, who de&s;ire to know no more thereof than what may be nece&s;&s;ary for me in the Narration of my Voyages.</P>
<P>Know then that God hath &s;o di&s;po|the Univer&s;e, that he hath joined the Earth and the Sea in one round Ma&s;s, who&s;e Weight repo&s;es in the Centre of the World, as being the lowe&s;t Place, &s;erving for a mo&s;t &s;ure Retreat and convenient Habitation for Man and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth for Man and Bea&s;t.</NOTE> Bea&s;t, in Parts rai&s;ed above the Wa|ters, which have their limited Place
<PB REF="5">
in the Aby&s;ms and Depth of the Earth. Now the&s;e Waters encompa&s;s all the Earth, and &s;eparate it by an admirable Artifice into Three great and &s;pacious Continents, or firm Lands, upon the which (according <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Con|tinents.</NOTE> to the order and &s;ituation of the &s;upe|rior Parts of the World) the Co&s;mo|graphers place Five principal Circles, which are the Equinoctial, the Two Tropicks of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> and the Two Polar-Circles, Artick, and Antartick. The fir&s;t Circle is called Equinoctial, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Circle of the Sphere upon the Earth.</NOTE> becau&s;e the Sun coming underneath the Circle, (which happens Twice in the Year, about the 21&s;t. of <HI>March,</HI> and the 24th. of <HI>September)</HI> cau&s;es, throughout the whole World, Day and Night to be of equal length. It is equally di&s;tant from the Two Poles, and divideth the Terre&s;trial Globe in|to Two Hemi&s;pheres, or equal Parts, one extending towards the North, and the other towards the South.</P>
<P>The Second Circle is the Tropick of Cancer, or Sol&s;tice of the Sum|mer, becau&s;e the Sun arriving there, cau&s;eth Summer to all the Countries on this &s;ide the Equinoctial, the which
<PB REF="6">
happens at &s;uch time as the Sun enters into the fir&s;t degree of <HI>Cancer,</HI> which is about the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Stili no|vi.</NOTE> 22d. of <HI>June;</HI> and then we have the longe&s;t Days, and &s;horte&s;t Nights in the Year. The Circle is di&s;tant from the Equator 23 Degrees and a half towards the Border of the North.</P>
<P>The Third Circle is the Tropick of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> or Sol&s;tice of the Win|ter, where the Sun arriving, which is about the 23d. of <HI>December,</HI> cau&s;eth the &s;horte&s;t Days and longe&s;t Nights with us; for to the other Hemi&s;phere of the South happens the contrary. It has the &s;ame Declen&s;ion of the E|quator towards the South as the other, to wit 23 Degrees.</P>
<P>The Fourth Circle, is the Circle Artick, and the Fifth, Antartick; each of them di&s;tant from its Pole 23 Degrees and a half.</P>
<P>Now by the&s;e Four la&s;t Circles, all the Earth is divided into Five Zones, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Zones.</NOTE> or Girdles, which encompa&s;s and co|ver the Face of the Earth, one of which is called Torrid or Burnt, two Temperate, and two Cold. The Tor|rid is &s;ituated betwixt the Two Tro|picks,
<PB REF="6">
45 Degrees in breadth; one of the Temperate, Septentrional betwixt the Tropick, and Cancer, and the Circle-Artick; the other, Meridional, betwixt the Tropick and Capricorn, and the Circle-Antartick, of 43 De|grees each. The two Cold, are one betwixt the Circle-Artick and its Pole, and the other betwixt the Circle-An|tartick, and its other Pole, each of 23 Degrees.</P>
<P>The Torrid Zone, thus called by the Ancients, in regard of the Opi|nion which they had, that becau&s;e of the Perpendicularity, and ordinary Neighbourhood of the Sun, all the&s;e Countries were uninhabitable, be|cau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive Heats, al&s;o that the cold Zones were &s;o, becau&s;e of the exce&s;&s;ive Cold, cau&s;ed by the great di&s;tance and lowne&s;s of this &s;ame Planet. But the Navigators of ours, and the precedent Ages, have by experience found all the&s;e Coun|tries Habitable and Peopled; &s;o that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Torrid Zone Inhabited.</NOTE> &s;ome of the mo&s;t Wi&s;e and Learned among&s;t the Ancients, have left be|hind them in their Writings more Di&s;|cour&s;e according to Rea&s;on and Sci|ence,
<PB REF="7">
than by Experience<HI>:</HI> For in the Torrid Zone, the Heat of the Day is gently temperated by the Cold, equal with the Night; and in the cold Zones, the Air is mitigated in Sum|mer, by rea&s;on of the long Re&s;idence of the Sun in their Horizon; be&s;ides the Cold there is rendred the le&s;s in|&s;upportable, in regard there being very little or no Winds, and their Bla&s;ts very feeble and weak. 'Tis true, the Countries under the cold Zones are &s;carcely Inhabited, becau&s;e the Earth does not there fructifie as in the Temperate. But as for tho&s;e of the Torrid Zone, there are va&s;t Places wonderfully Peopled, as well for the Commodity of the Waters, as for the Goodne&s;s and Fertility of the Coun|tries, which bear Grain, or Rice, in abundance, like the Countries &s;ubject to the King <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> towards the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope, Angoche,</HI> and the Cape of <HI>Currants,</HI> and the Country of the <HI>Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ines,</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;ter-John,</HI> which extends in Land from <HI>Bomba&s;e</HI> to the <HI>Red-Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Ea&s;tern Coa&s;t you have al&s;o very &s;pacious I&s;lands, as tho&s;e of
<PB REF="7">
St. <HI>Lawrance, Zealand, Maldives, Su|matra,</HI> the <HI>Java's, Moluque's,</HI> and o|thers without Number, extream fer|tile, and abounding in what&s;oever is delectable, and nece&s;&s;ary for Human Life.</P>
<P>Towards the We&s;t, are the Lands of <HI>New-Spain, Bra&s;il,</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and others adjacent, near to the Equator, which are very good. All which clearly &s;hews the Fal&s;hood of the O|pinions of the Ancients concerning the Habitation of the&s;e Zones.</P>
<P>Now the Extent or Breadth of the&s;e Five Zones, from the Equinoctial to each Pole, is divided into Paralells, as their length from Ea&s;t to We&s;t into Meridians; from whence is taken the Longitudes, and Latitudes of divers Countries.</P>
<P>The Parallels are Circles equally di&s;tant one from the other, beginning at the Equator, and fini&s;hing at the Poles. The Meridians are Circles pa&s;&s;ing through the Poles, and cro&s;|&s;ing the Equator; or when the Sun is arrived, it cau&s;eth Noon to tho&s;e who are above the Horizon, and Mid-night to tho&s;e who are underneath.</P>
<P><PB REF="8">
The Latitude of Regions is di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the Parallels from North to South, as the Longitude by the Me|ridians from Ea&s;t to We&s;t: The Me|ridians of equal Extent, gather toge|ther from Two Poles; but the Paral|lels do not &s;o, who are always equally di&s;tant one from the other, tho' &s;ome|times greater, or le&s;s, according to their Approach to the Equator or Poles.</P>
<P>According to the Extent of the&s;e Circles, are taken the Longitudes and Latitudes of divers Countries and Places of the Earth. The Latitude, or Hieght, is counted from the Equino|ctial to the Poles, from one part to another, by 90 Degrees<HI>:</HI> And the Longitudes, beginning at the Meri|dian of the Fortunate I&s;lands, or <HI>Ca|naries,</HI> go from We&s;t to Ea&s;t 360 De|grees quite round the Earth; in which 'tis Remarkable, that the Regions un|der the &s;ame Degree or Latitude what|&s;oever, have in the &s;ame moment the like *Time, as tho&s;e who under divers <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weather or Sea&s;on.</NOTE> degrees have Diver&s;ity, and that in varying, in an Hour's time, by 15 Degrees, &s;ooner or later, according as
<PB REF="8">
you are more Ea&s;t or We&s;t. Thus tho&s;e who are under the &s;ame Degree of Latitude, tho' &s;everal of Longi|tude, have Day and Night equally, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Days and Nights di|vers.</NOTE> the &s;ame Sea&s;ons on the one &s;ide the Equinoctial; for on the other, 'tis quite the contrary: like as if the Winter is in the Septentrional Part, you &s;hall have the Summer in the Me|ridional, tho' in the &s;ame Latitude, as I have remark'd in the Kingdom of <HI>Canary,</HI> and <HI>Goa,</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> where they have their Winter in <HI>June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> contrary to the &s;ame Latitude of our <HI>Europe:</HI> But this Winter con&s;i&s;ts only in Rains, and great Winds coming from the South; and this Rain is very hot, in&s;omuch that the Winter in the&s;e Parts of <HI>Goa,</HI> is rather hotter than our Summer here, the Trees there being continually green, and bearing Fruit in all their Sea&s;ons, as Jaquebar, Anana's, Jan|gomes, Carambola's, Jambo's, and others; for all the Winter is hot and moi&s;t, and then the Sun &s;eldom ap|pears, being hid under thick Clouds, &s;o that it renders the Days very dark. But the Places who have divers Lati|tudes
<PB REF="9">
have inequality of Days and Nights, more or le&s;s, according to their difference, and approaches, or di&s;tance from the Poles: The Day be|ginning from Sun-ri&s;ing to the &s;etting thereof.</P>
<P>In the Countries under the Equi|noctial, they are equal with the Nights, of 22 Hours each; on the contrary, in tho&s;e Places &s;tretching towards the Poles, they lengthen as in the 30th. Degree of Latitude, the longe&s;t Day being 13 Hours 5 Minutes; un|der the 50 Degree, 'tis 16 Hours, 20 Minutes; under the 66 and half, or in the Artick-Circle, 'tis 24 Hours intire; under the 70. the Sun &s;ets not, during 64 Days, and 14 Hours, as in tho&s;e Parts of <HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> as I have heard a <HI>Dutch</HI> Captain &s;ay who has been there, that their longe&s;t Day, without Night, was from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>July,</HI> as in Winter they have Night proportionably; &s;o that it is expedi|ent for the Ships which come from tho&s;e Countries to return in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> except they have a mind to be &s;topp'd by the Ice. The People who inhabit tho&s;e Countries, make,
<PB REF="9">
during the Winter, little Holes in the Ice to take Sea-Wolves, tho' &s;ome|times they are deceiv'd, and caught them&s;elves, as I have been inform'd; &s;o that Multitudes of People have been &s;wallowed up, the Ice coming to break on a &s;udden, by rea&s;on the time or &s;ea&s;on of the Heat approaches &s;ome|times &s;ooner than ordinary, the which has cau&s;ed the&s;e People to be more circum&s;pect for the future.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o Remarkable; That the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Degrees and their Quantity.</NOTE> Degrees of Latitude are always every where equal, each Degree containing 15 <HI>German</HI> Leagues, or 17 and a half of <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> 25 of <HI>French,</HI> or 60 <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Miles: But the Degrees of Lon|gitude are equal with tho&s;e of Lati|tude, under the Equinoctial only; and the more they decline there from, they dimini&s;h, until that under the Poles they are reduced into one Point: For under the Line, the Degree of Longitude contains 60 Miles, whenas under the 60 Degree of Latitude 'tis no more than Thirty, and under the Pole nothing at all. So that it &s;hall
<PB REF="10">
happen, that Two Ships being di&s;tant one from the other 150 Miles, if they &s;ail from the Equinoctial towards the Septentrion, being arrived under the 60 Degree, they &s;hall be no more than 75 Miles di&s;tant, and under the 71 Degree, 31 Minutes, they &s;hall ap|proach to Fifty, and at la&s;t under the Pole &s;hall meet.</P>
<P>The Pilots ought well to ob&s;erve this, in regard of the Currents which are found in certain Parts; &s;o that thinking to make one way, they take another: Al&s;o I advi&s;e 'em to take heed they be not deceiv'd by certain Cards, which commonly are fal&s;e, ex|cept they have been experienc'd by good Pilots. This happen'd to us in our Voyage to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> part|ing from the River of <HI>Cayenna,</HI> where the Caribes are, to the I&s;les of <HI>Santa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ucia:</HI> For we were deceiv'd as well by the Currents, as the Cards we had with us, which were fal&s;e, we find|ing but one which was &s;ure for tho&s;e Parts; for in&s;tead of going to the I|&s;lands afore&s;aid, we pa&s;&s;ed along by
<PB REF="10">
the I&s;le of <HI>Tobaco,</HI> and <HI>Trinidad,</HI> and ca&s;t Anchor at the <HI>White-I&s;land,</HI> where we could find no Water, of which we were in great want. 'Twas no &s;mall A&s;toni&s;hment to me, how &s;uch infi|nite Multitudes of Cabrits, and wild Goats, (be&s;ides other Animals which are there,) could live without &s;o much as a drop of Water: But the Divine Providence has otherways order'd it, (as I have above-touched) by the cool Nights, and the Dew, with which the&s;e Bea&s;ts refre&s;h them&s;elves.</P>
<P>From thence we went to <HI>Margurite</HI> I&s;land, but we found no more Water there than we did at the other, and &s;o to the Mouth of the River of <HI>Cu|mana,</HI> where the People of a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship had told us we &s;hould find &s;ome, as we did at the entrance of the Ri|ver. This &s;hews the Nece&s;&s;ity of ha|ving good Cards, and well rectified.</P>
<P>But to return to the Three Conti|nents, or firm Lands, from the which all the Earth is &s;eparated by Waters: The fir&s;t was by the Ancients divided into Three Parts, to wit, <HI>Europe, A|&s;ia,</HI>
<PB REF="11">
and <HI>Africa,</HI> all joining together. The &s;econd, unknown to the Anci|ents, and di&s;cover'd in our Days by <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus,</HI> in the Year 1492, and by <HI>Americus Ve&s;pu&s;ius,</HI> 1495, is <HI>America,</HI> which for its va&s;t Extent is divided into Two Parts, <HI>Peru,</HI> and <HI>Mexico.</HI> The Third is <HI>Terra-Au&s;tralis,</HI> or <HI>Mag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">llanique,</HI> thus called, becau&s;e of <HI>Ferdinand M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">llan,</HI> who fir&s;t found it out in the Year 1519.

<PB REF="11">
a very boi&s;terous Wind, and approach|ing &s;omewhat nigh, the Wind drove the &s;ulphurous Vapours ju&s;t into our <NOTE PLACE="marg">Europe.</NOTE> Faces, which were very un&s;upporta|ble and &s;tinking.</P>
<P><HI>Europe,</HI> the fir&s;t of the Three Con|tinents, is the lea&s;t in extent, and for her Fertility gives not place to the o|thers; but for Arms, Laws, Policy, Rel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">gion, Sciences, Arts, and all &s;orts of Vertues, &s;he &s;urpa&s;&s;es them by far. And of the Provinces of <HI>Europe, France</HI> alone is the Principal, accord|ing to the Judgment of the Nations her Enemies, whether you con&s;ider the Goodne&s;s, Fertility, and Beauty of her Lands, the Excellency and tem|perature of the Air, Salubrity, and Abundance of her Waters, and Num|ber of Inhabitants; or in regard of the Manners of her People, their Pie|ty, Valour, Erudition, Ju&s;tice, Di&s;|cipline, Liberality, Freene&s;s, Courte|&s;ie, Liberty, and all other Qualities Military and Civil. In &s;hort, the Renown of the <HI>French</HI> has been &s;uch, by their Conque&s;t in the Ea&s;t, that

their Name remains there for an Eter|nal Memory<HI>:</HI> So that to this Day, throughout all <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> they call all tho&s;e who come from <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Name of <HI>Franghi,</HI> let them be of what Country &s;oever.</P>
<P>The Fertility of <HI>France</HI> is &s;uch, that &s;he furni&s;heth abundantly, <HI>Spain, Por|tugal, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Barbary,</HI> not only with Corn, but &s;everal other Com|modities; and I verily think, that eve|ry Year there goes from <HI>Provence, Languedoc, Bretagne, Poitou, Xain|toign,</HI> and <HI>Normandy,</HI> above Six thou|&s;and Ships laden with Corn, and o|ther Merchandi&s;e.

At la&s;t after having viewed us well on all &s;ides, and taking notice of the Port, and fa&s;hion of our Ship, they returned toward their Admiral, who was about 3 or 4.

Our Cap|tain, who was of a great Courage, would not hearken to yielding: Here|upon we went on Board the Flemi&s;h-Ship to know their plea&s;ure. This Flemi&s;h Ship at the fir&s;t di&s;charge of her Cannon, had burnt all her Powder, with which a great number of her Men were di&s;abled and de&s;troyed. They had put their Powder in a piece of Sail, and a Match by chance touched <NOTE PLACE="marg">Accident of Powder.</NOTE> it, which was the cau&s;e of this Di&s;a|&s;ter. I went on Board their Ship to &s;ee their Pilot, who was quite Roa&s;ted, his Belly, Face, and Hands, mighty big and &s;woln; I brought him &s;ome Remedies. I was told that there was 4 or 5 others in a very bad condition, and ready to die: They were Burnt after a pitious and horrible manner. In the end, after we had well con|&s;ulted with them, it was re&s;olved to &s;end a Boat on Board the Enemies, with a Man that under&s;tood their Language, for they were Engli&s;h; which was done accordingly: But

they would be pacified by no means what&s;oever, &s;aying, that they had &s;uffered a great deal of lo&s;s, and that it was not their intention to do any harm to the French, that being ex|pre&s;ly forbidden them by the Queen their Mi&s;tre&s;s: But that our Captain had given them ill Language, and that he him&s;elf mu&s;t come on Board them to excu&s;e him&s;elf, which was done; And they came on Board us, with the Boats of their two Ships, &s;earching in every corner, but they found nothing but Salt: If they had met with our Money, we &s;hould have been in a bad condition; for they had played us a trick of their Trade. At la&s;t, after we had made them &s;ome Pre&s;ents of Victuals, they withdrew them&s;elves. Their Mariners and Sol|diers told us that they had re&s;olved to have fallen&punc; upon us in the morn|ing; and had Drank to one another, and Eaten all the little Refre&s;hment they had, hoping to have more of us; but God by his Mercy delivered us from them.</P>

I had a wonderful de&s;ire to &s;ee tho&s;e Countries: And for this cau&s;e I <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Embarking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> the</HI> VVe&s;t-In|dies.</NOTE> entered my &s;elf with the <HI>Sieur,</HI> and embarked in his Ship in the Haven of <HI>Concale</HI> the 12th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1604. We went to <HI>Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> (which is an I&s;le five Leagues from <HI>Concale)</HI> there to wait for weather for us to put to Sea. We tarried there till the 24th of the &s;ame month, not without having &s;uffered by great Winds; which gave us no &s;mall trouble, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of our Boat; but we &s;oon bought another, and at la&s;t &s;et Sail, bearing South Ea&s;t, and in a little time&punc; we pa&s;&s;ed the Channel. And fora&s;much as our Ship was new, not having as yet been pro|ved in the Sea, we were forced to &s;uffer her to take her Cour&s;e; not be|ing able to bear up Sails; for &s;he veer'd after &s;uch a manner, (her Top-Ma&s;t being high) that &s;he was continually with one &s;ide upon the Water, which was a great inconvenience: Never|thele&s;s, putting our tru&s;t in God, we proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ded on; and at the height of the Cape <HI>de Finibus Terrae,</HI> we found a Ship, and made full &s;ail upon her to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> know what &s;he was.

up to, and being prepared to attack her, and they al&s;o provided to receive us, we found out that it was a French Ship, the Captain of which came up|on the Poop well armed, with his Sword in his Hand, crying out to us to Steer Leeward, or el&s;e he would fire at us; but we conte&s;ting a little thereupon, that we might find out and know of what part of <HI>France</HI> he might be: After having well con&s;idered him and known him for a right French Man, we came up Leewards of him, of which he was not a little Proud, thinking that we had been a Man of War, and dur&s;t not a&s;&s;ault him; for he made &s;igns with his Sword upon the Poop, that we had done well to come up &s;o: But our de&s;ign was not to make War upon our Nation; be|&s;ides, that might have been enough to have broken our Voyage.</P>
<P>Holding then our Cour&s;e, we had &s;o favourable a Wind that we came near to the I&s;le of <HI>Lancelot</HI> the 6th of <HI>February;</HI> upon which day one of our Men fell over-board into the Sea, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Di&s;a&s;ter.</NOTE> it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave him, becau&s;e we had a right Wind. We pre&s;ently

tack'd about upon him; but coming to the place, where he fell. we found nothing but his Breeches. All things that belong'd to him were pre&s;ently put to Sale upon the Deck, and every one Bought what he had occa&s;ion for, as Coats, Linnen, and other Things, with which he was very well furni|&s;hed: For he was of the Rank of the Nobility, and was named <HI>Duvall,</HI> of <HI>Vire</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI></P>
<P>This done, we &s;teered our Cour&s;e towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coa&s;t of</HI> Barbary.</NOTE> next day the 11th of the &s;ame month, we arrived near the Land to find out a Port, and ca&s;t Anchor in a Creek or Bay, putting out our Boat to go on &s;hore: But coming there, we found nothing but De&s;arts, without any thing el&s;e; in&s;omuch, that we re|turned again on Board the Ship to weigh Anchor, and to look out &s;ome other place more proper to &s;tay in, and to fit up our Patache, &s;cowring along this Coa&s;t all the re&s;t of that day and the night following&punc;</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently after, we found out the Mouth of the River <HI>Rio Del Oro,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rio del Oro.</NOTE> where we &s;ent our Boat to Sound the
<PB N="43" REF="77">
depth of it, and to &s;ee if we might enter in &s;o far as a little I&s;land of flat Sand, which tho&s;e in the Boat had perceived. They found but 12 Foot of Water, and our Ship drew already as many&punc; &s;o that the Keel touched Ground; but we had no harm, be|cau&s;e the River was Calm. Coming then to this I&s;land, within the River of&punc; <HI>Rio del Oro,</HI> about five Leagues within from the Mouth, which is not taken notice of in the Map. We named the &s;ame, <HI>Touch I&s;land,</HI> after <NOTE PLACE="marg">Touch-I&s;land.</NOTE> the Sirname of our Commander, the Sieur <HI>de la Ravardiere,</HI> where we ca&s;t Anchor to tarry for &s;ome time. And the 15th of <HI>February</HI> we began to fit up our Patache, which was ready in our Ship, and only wanted Mounting and Chaulking.</P>
<P>During this time we went daily to look for Shells, the fine&s;t in the world, and &s;eemed as if they were enamel'd with Gold: As I put &s;ome of them into my Handkerchief, the Poi&s;on within, (which was like little Snails) &s;tained it into a Purple colour; and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea Purple.</NOTE> perhaps it might be the &s;ame <HI>E&s;pece de Murex,</HI> &s;o celebrated by the Antients,
<PB N="44" REF="78">
and unknown at this time. We ga|thered a great quantity of them for their Beauty. We caught al&s;o with our Nets, as much Fi&s;h as we could well find u&s;e for.</P>
<P>This I&s;land was&punc; full of <HI>Cormorants,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cormorants and their watch.</NOTE> of which we killed a great number with our Harquebus &s;hot. Of the&s;e Birds there is always one that watches when the others take their re&s;t, as 'tis &s;aid of the Cranes. We had much ado to come near them, and were forced to creep along the Ground to take them. But after they began to be a little frighted with the Harque|bu&s;&s;es, they came no more as before.</P>
<P>We tarried near a month in this place without &s;eeing any Man; but about five or &s;ix days before our de|parture, we perceived a Smoak in the Country, about three Leagues from us; which made us conjecture that there were &s;ome <HI>Lybians</HI> and Blacks <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Blacks of</HI> Lybia.</NOTE> come there, becau&s;e towards the Coa&s;t, the De&s;arts of <HI>Lybia</HI> begin. The&s;e Blacks were come a great way out of the Country, to look towards the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oa&s;t to &s;ee if there was any Ship to Traffick for Ambergreece, and car|ried
<PB N="45" REF="78">
their Water in Goat-Skins, cut out for that purpo&s;e. In the night time they creep into the Sand to Sleep, for fear of being &s;melt out by the Li|ons and Tygers, who are there in abun|dance.</P>
<P>It might be properly &s;aid, that the&s;e Men came out of Hell, they were &s;o burnt, and dreadful to look upon: We &s;ent then our Boat to know the cau&s;e of the&s;e Fires &s;een in the Coun|try, and found three of the&s;e Lybians, (of which 2 came on board our Ship) and one of them told me, that he was the Kin&s;man of <HI>Taquide Alforme</HI> of <HI>Cape Blanc,</HI> of whom I enquir'd news, fora&s;much as having heard of him in my former Voyage, towards <HI>Cape Blanc.</HI></P>
<P>This was the time that they fa&s;ted their <HI>Ramadan,</HI> and would not Eat any thing till night. 'Tis a great pity to &s;ee the&s;e People, how poor and mi|&s;erable they are, without Bread or-any other Food. They Eat nothing but O&s;trich Eggs, and &s;ome dried Fi&s;h, be&s;ides &s;ome Fle&s;h of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>He that had &s;tayed alone on Shore, was Son to one of the&s;e other two,
<PB N="46" REF="79">
and came to receive his Father's com|ing out of the Boat, pro&s;trating him|&s;elf before him, and ki&s;&s;ing his Hand&punc; Then his Father gave him &s;ome of the Bi&s;quet that we had given him, of which he was exceeding glad, for he was very Hungry, and had &s;upped but badly in the&s;e De&s;arts; for the mo&s;t part inhabited by Wild Bea&s;ts&punc; which are continually there: And from our Ship we heard &s;ometimes in the night terrible Cries and Roaring.</P>
<P>In all this Coa&s;t we could not find any fre&s;h Water, nor before in the Ri|ver, where we &s;ent our Boat to look for &s;ome, but in vain, all the Coun|try being De&s;art, and quite Barren This I&s;land where we had ca&s;t An|chor, was directly under the Tropick of <HI>Cancer.</HI></P>
<P>Now having fitted up, and put out again our Patache to Sea, we &s;et fail the 10th of <HI>March,</HI> and having born South We&s;t towards the I&s;les of <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;les of</HI> Cape Verd.

<P><PB N="47" REF="79">
All the&s;e I&s;lands are much &s;ubject to Storms and Boi&s;terous Winds, as it happened to us at this I&s;le of <HI>Brava,</HI> where we lo&s;t an Anchor, being ob|lig'd to weigh and drop Anchor &s;o frequently there, when the Wind would drive us &s;ometimes towards Land, pre&s;ently again to the Sea. 'Tis &s;uppo&s;ed that the&s;e Winds are &s;hut up there in &s;ome Gulf, as they come out at certain hours of the day. And what is more &s;trange, is, that a League from thence, the Sea was calm, and without Wind; which made me be|lieve that the&s;e Winds being &s;o &s;hut up, and come out with &s;uch violence, have not the force to penetrate far, being &s;truck back, and repul&s;ed by the Winds which come from the Sea.</P>
<P>We could not find out the Habita|tions of the&s;e I&s;landers; who are Por|tugue&s;e, Me&s;tices, and Blacks: The I&s;land bears Tobacco, abundance of Mace, and other Fruits. The Coun|try is very Mountainous, and there are &s;ome Fig-Trees to be &s;een, with Mulbery-Trees, and others.</P>

After we had well refre&s;hed our &s;elves with &s;weet&punc; Water, dried Fi&s;h, and other things, which the I&s;landers &s;old us, we weighed Anchor to Steer our Cour&s;e, and had the Wind &s;o fa|vourable, that we arrived at the Mouth of the River of the <HI>Amazons</HI> on <HI>Palm.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>River of the</HI> Ama|zons.</NOTE> <HI>Sunday,</HI> about three hours before day.

<P>We &s;eeing our &s;elves as &s;oon as it was morning intangled among&s;t the&s;e roaring Streams and Currents, having &s;carce any Wind, they who were up&punc;on the Watch began to cry out, that we were all lo&s;t, thinking we had been upon the the Shelves&punc; At this noi&s;e every one began to &s;tir him&s;elf to look out for help; and I hearing this word <HI>Lo&s;t,</HI> mounted pre&s;ently upon the Deck to &s;ee if there was any way to &s;wim, and if we were near Land, having no other way to &s;ave our &s;elves but by Swiming till day, hoping to have &s;ight of Land, from

Hereupon the Pi|lot well advis'd, took the Plummet in Hand, and found in Sounding 25 Fa|thom; whereof being very glad, he cried out, that we were in the River <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>River of the</HI> Amazons.</NOTE> of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> which is almo&s;t one Degree on this &s;ide the Line.

<P>On Monday we de&s;cried Land, ve|ry low towards the South We&s;t, and by little and little we app<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oached the Coa&s;t, to have knowledge of the Country, but with fear to run a&punc;ground; for there the bottom is nothing but Mud, which we touched every mo|ment.</P>
<P>As we were thus wandring about, by good chance we perceived a Canoe <NOTE PLACE="marg">Encounter with Indi|ans.</NOTE> with 17 Indians, who came towards us, and went to our Patache which was before us, after that they came on board us: They were all naked,

Their Captain &s;eemed to be a Man of good fa&s;hion, yet he was &s;tark naked, and had only a Lan|goutin, which is a little piece of painted Cotton, to cover his Privities.

On Tue&s;day the 11th of <HI>April,</HI> I went to their Habitations to &s;ee if I could get any more Curio&s;ities, taking &s;ome Knives, and other Pedlars-Ware, to exchange with them.

<P>I believe the&s;e <HI>Caripous</HI> are of all the Indians the mo&s;t &s;weet and mild in Behaviour: They are very curious of Honour, Ambitious to do Kindne&s;s to tho&s;e who vi&s;it them: The Wo|men, Girls, and Children, came very freely on board our Ship, without any &s;hew of &s;hame for their Naked|ne&s;s,

but were continually drawing their Legs clo&s;e, like Half-Moons. There was a little Indian brought me &s;ome Balls of Tobacco, with a little Ca&s;e made of the Bark of a Tree, as wide as a Pocket, and as round as a Ring: It's that which the Men make u&s;e of to bind up their Privy-Parts; they can ea&s;ily change them, or take them away when they plea&s;e. I took two or three of them for curio&s;ity, &s;eeing 'em &s;o ingeniou&s;ly made. All the In|dians round about having heard the di&s;charge of Cannon, came pre&s;ently from every quarter that was nigh, to exchange their Goods with our Knives, Hatchets, and other &s;mall Ware.</P>
<P>When the Cannon had fired, the noi&s;e of it continued near a quarter of an hour in the&s;e rough Woods, &s;o that all the Country, Mountains, and Val|lies, were filled with the Eccho's, which an&s;wered one another with a wonderful noi&s;e, which might be heard as I believe, above 25 Leagues from thence.</P>
<P>As for the re&s;t, the&s;e <HI>Caripous</HI> People are great Enemies to the <HI>Ca|ribes,</HI> who make mortal War one <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes.</NOTE>

the Hair of the Beard, &s;o that it could &s;carce be felt. I gave a little Knife in exchange for it. This Cap|taih who had promi&s;ed me &s;o many Rarities, came to offer me among&s;t other Things, a Tru&s;s of Serpents, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents good to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">at.</NOTE> which were as Fat as a great Conger, and the Skin &s;o &s;peckled with yellow, grey, blue, and other colours, that I had no great mind to try how they reli&s;h'd, though &s;ome living on them, make great Fea&s;ts together: They are prepared in Leaves, and roa&s;ted.

<P>Speaking of this Captain, I will relate in this place a &s;trange and re|markable thing of the&s;e People, that the Nephew of <HI>Anacajoury</HI> told me, to whom the Soveraign Command of this Country belongeth, and becau&s;e of his Youth, his Uncle governed un|til &s;uch time as he &s;hould be of Age to Rule. He told me, That they did Eat neither Fle&s;h nor Fi&s;h until <NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Ceremonies to make Captains.</NOTE> they had killed &s;ome of their Enemies; and when they had killed any one of them in War, they ob&s;erved this Ce|remony, which &s;hould not be other|ways agreeable to our French Cap|tains.

Ground but upon great occa&s;ion, and with Judgment undergo all the hard&s;hips of War, be they never &s;o great; and love the Virtue, Honour, and Reputation of a good and ju&s;t Coptain. VVhen they have fini&s;hed this Di&s;cour&s;e, they take a great Switch in Hand, wherewith every one gives him three great Blows, with all their force, &s;o that the Body is all over Black and Bloody, upon which Bli|&s;ters may be &s;een to ri&s;e as big as ones Finger; and &s;o one after another make him the &s;ame Di&s;cour&s;e, repeating &s;o many Blows with the Switch; which la&s;ts a full Month, 3 or 4 times a Week. In the mean time this poor Patient in all that time Eats nothing but Ca&s;aves and Potates, until he has had all his Ornaments of Virtue. And then they make a great Fire, putting thereon Green Leaves to make it Smoak, and al&s;o to hinder the force of the Flame; Then they have an <HI>Amica,</HI> or Hanging Bed after their manner, in which they put this new Captain, crowning him with Leaves; and there he mu&s;t endure all the Heat and Smoak untill hr Swoon's away,

and &s;eeing he &s;carce Breaths, they let the Bed down, and taking plenty of fre&s;h Water, they ca&s;t it upon him, untill he comes again to him|&s;elf, as from Death to Life. All this being done, he is Honoured as a great Captain, and then they go a Crui&s;ing along the Coa&s;ts to meet their Ene|mies: After being upon their return to their Habitations, they make &s;till Remon&s;trances to this new Captain, and give him each one, three Blows; and from thence forth he may Eat Fle&s;h. Sometime after that, they take another turn in the Sea with their Cannoes; and if they find any of their Enemies, they fail not to return to perfect this Captain, to whom they give three Blows more, and then he may Eat Fi&s;h; and &s;o he is created and admitted into the Office, to bear Command over the others. But that is not done but to tho&s;e who have well behaved them&s;elves in Battle, knock|ing down many Enemies.</P>

<P>As for my part, I &s;aw almo&s;t the like in my return: For we had in our Ship three Indians, whom we brought into <HI>France,</HI> two <HI>Caribes,</HI> Brothers, and one <HI>Caripou,</HI> Nephew to the King of <HI>Yapoco.</HI></P>
<P>Now one of the&s;e Brother <HI>Caribes,</HI> the lea&s;t named <HI>Atoupa,</HI> (we being <NOTE PLACE="marg">Atoupa</NOTE> in the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> where the <HI>Caribes</HI> are) &s;aid, He would go into <HI>France,</HI> but he thought the Ship was <HI>France,</HI> and called it &s;o; but when we were to go away, he &s;trove with all his force to leap into the Sea, to &s;ave him&s;elf on Land; And we being at Anchor in the River, to hinder him we gave him in cu&s;tody to the <HI>Caripou Yapoco,</HI> their &s;worn Enemy; &s;o that at every &s;tep that <HI>Atoupa</HI> took, <HI>Yapoco</HI> took another, following him up and down every where in the Ship, and bid us let him alone, and if at any time he were &s;o bold as to ca&s;t him|&s;elf

into the Sea, he al&s;o would be pre&s;ently after him, and make him Dive his Head to the bottom, to Drink to his Friends. This little <HI>Caribe Atoupa,</HI> not being above 14 or 15 years of Age, one day took a re&s;olu|tion to Drown or Kill him&s;elf, as he could be&s;t have occa&s;ion; and had ca&s;t him&s;elf into the Sea had not he, who, ever had an eye upon him, catched hold of his Legs. When we were in the main Sea, his Brother held him continually Embraced, and in the night he tied him, but he was often found untied; and &s;eeing that he could find no expedient to Drown or Kill him&s;elf, (for he was not &s;uffered to get to any Knives, wherewith he might do him&s;elf a mi&s;chief) one day finding a piece of &s;harp pointed Wood, he &s;truck <HI>Yapoco</HI> &s;uch a blow there|with upon the Throat, that it &s;liced away the Skin from one &s;ide of his Neck; which our General hearing of, cau&s;ed him to be brought upon the Deck, and with a Whip made of Pack thread, tied to a Stick, to be &s;e|verely Whipp'd, but he &s;eemed as if he had not been touched, only &s;hrink|ing

up his Shoulders a little, without either crying out, or &s;peaking one word; which &s;eemed very &s;trange to me, &s;eeing him &s;o marked with the Stripes he had received &s;o &s;everely.</P>
<P>But to return again to our Traffick in this Country of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> having made Exchange of all the Merchandize that could be found there, we took a re&s;o|lution to go to the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cayenne <HI>River.</HI></NOTE> where the <HI>Caribes</HI> are: But before our departure, the King of <HI>Yapoco</HI> came on board our Ship, with his Wife, his Si&s;ter, and his Mother, with the In|dian <HI>Yapoeo</HI> whom we carried away with us, who was his Nephew, his Si&s;ter's Son, in who&s;e room the King <HI>Anacajoury</HI> governed, untill his Majo|rity, which would be in a &s;hort time.

Then he embarked in a little Ship with the Segnior <HI>du Bos,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> who was come from the Voyage that I made with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Ravardiere;</HI> but having been taken by the Pirates towards <HI>England,</HI> he found means afterwards to return into <HI>France,</HI> and went to find out Madam <HI>de la Ravardiere</HI> in <HI>Poictou,</HI> where he had been before, the other Voyage, and told her News of her Husband, who tarried behind at <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI> It happened that one day, a Hog falling into the Ca&s;tle Ditch, this Lady commanded her Servants, and among the re&s;t <HI>Yapoco,</HI> to help to draw him out; but he, though born in the Country of the Savages&punc; di&s;|daining a piece of work &s;o vile and ba&s;e, told her plainly, that he would not do it; upon which, the Lady giving him &s;ome har&s;h Language, he out of Anger went away without a farewel, and came &s;treight to <HI>Rochelle,</HI> where he found &s;ome <HI>Hablois,</HI> who brought him to the <HI>Havre,</HI> and from thence he went to <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="92">
When I had thus met with him, and Care&s;&s;ed him, I carried him to my Lodging, where I treated him as well as I could: After that, I took him to the King, who de&s;ired to &s;ee him: I cau&s;ed him to Kneel before the King, who commanded me to &s;peak to him in his own Language, for I under|&s;tood a little of it; Then he ordered &s;ome Money to be given him.</P>
<P>After that, he was carried to the <HI>Havre,</HI> where Madam <HI>de la Ravar|diere</HI> &s;ent for him by her Servants, and &s;ince I heard no more News of him: Such was the Fortune of this young <HI>Yapoco.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to the&s;e People, Sa|vage <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Good Na|ture of the</HI> Caripous.</NOTE> as they are, they are great Friends to Honour, and of all that which is ju&s;t and true, which they reverence from their Infancy, abhorring all wicked Men and Cheats, as much as they are Friends to the good and ver|tuous. They do not Love a Coward, or a Pultron, but Honour &s;uch as are Valiant and Couragious.</P>
<P>But &s;ince we are &s;till near the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> before we part from thence, it will not be much ami&s;s to
<PB N="73" REF="92">
&s;ay &s;omething of it from what I was able to learn in tho&s;e Parts.</P>
<P>Some have taken the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> or <HI>Oregliane,</HI> for that of <HI>Maragnan;</HI> but others will make two of them, and &s;ay, that their Mouths are di&s;tant &s;ome hundred Leagues; that of <HI>Maragan</HI> making the limits of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> on the Northen Coa&s;t, as the River of Plate, or Silver, makes the other Bounds on the South. All the&s;e Rivers come from the Moun|tains of <HI>Peru,</HI> the highe&s;t, and of the difficulte&s;t acce&s;s of any others in the whole World.</P>
<P>The River of the <HI>Amazons</HI> is very <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>River of the</HI> Amazons.</NOTE> broad in its Mouth, &s;ome 50 Leagues or thereabouts from one Shore to the other, and contains &s;everal great I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Sea there runs at the hours of the Tide, being very &s;wift in its Eb|bing and Flowing, and carries along with it many Trees and Plants it plucks up by the Roots, all along the Coa&s;ts, which are like great Fore&s;ts; for there the Coa&s;t being low, the Sea ea&s;ily enters far up into the Country. The colour of this River inclines to a
<PB N="74" REF="93">
dark grey: We found the Water of it Sweet 30 Leagues within the Sea. Within this River, about 30 or 40 Leagues up, are &s;ome I&s;lands where the&s;e Warlike Women, the <HI>Amazons</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amazons <HI>Warlike Women.</HI></NOTE> inhabit, who make War upon tho&s;e of the Continent of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il;</HI> and on the other &s;ide, where the Indians inhabit, towards the Cape of <HI>Voyanpouc,</HI> are their Friends and con&s;tant Confederates. The&s;e Wo|men for Propagation, have to do every year with the &s;aid Indians in the month of <HI>April,</HI> and give them notice when they de&s;ire to have them come to &s;ee them, all the Days and Hours of that month, and do not &s;uffer the &s;aid In|dians to enter into their I&s;lands more &s;trong than them&s;elves, &s;etting &s;ome to guard the entrance, whil&s;t others pa&s;s away their time, exchanging al|ways the&s;e guards, by their turn, and &s;o imploying all this Month of Love in the &s;oft Care&s;&s;es of Joy and De|light. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Month of Love.</NOTE> At the end of the year, when their Confederates return to them, if they have Conceived in the mean time, they keep the Females, and give the Males to the Men, not keep|ing
<PB N="75" REF="93">
them above a year; And 'tis pro|bable that the&s;e Sons which they give to the&s;e Indians, may afterwards have to do with their Si&s;ters and near Kin&s;-Women; For they have a Cu&s;tom always to &s;eek out the Children of tho&s;e they have had to do with. Now, though the&s;e Indians &s;hould be all Married in the Continent, the&s;e <HI>Ama|zons</HI> &s;erve them only for Friends, and make Pre&s;ents to one another for a &s;ign of Mutual Love and Good Will. As to that which &s;ome &s;ay, that they wear but one Brea&s;t, and Burn off the other, according to the manner of the ancient <HI>Amazons,</HI> who inhabited towards the <HI>Thanais</HI> and <HI>Thermodon,</HI> they are nothing but Fables. 'Tis true&punc; that the&s;e Women do on purpo&s;e lo&s;e the Milk of one Brea&s;t that they may the better draw the Bow; and &s;o perhaps this &s;aying of the Ancients is to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The Son of the King of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> among&s;t other Things, told me, That the&s;e Women wear the Hair of their Privy-Parts very long, Combing them like their Heads, and that they are of a very great &s;tature; adding al&s;o,
<PB N="76" REF="94">
that he had been in their Country with his Uncle <HI>Anacajoury.</HI></P>
<P>We could not go to &s;ee them, as we de&s;ired, becau&s;e the Streams there are too violent for Ve&s;&s;els, and e&s;pe|cially for our Ship and Patache, who drew in already abundance of Water: For the Streams run towards the Coa&s;t, and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to go there except it be with a Boat and Oars, or with the Indians Cannoes, which draw but one Foot of Water.</P>
<P>Behold what I was able to learn of the&s;e <HI>Amazons;</HI> which makes me not to give credit to all that we find writ|ten of tho&s;e antient Women, &s;o famous. 'Tis &s;aid that there are &s;till &s;ome of them in <HI>Africa,</HI> towards the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Monomotapa.</HI></P>
<P>All the Country on the Left Hand, at the entrance into the River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> is comprehended in the great Province of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> fir&s;t di&s;cove|red by <HI>Alvarez Cabral,</HI> a Portugal Captain, in the year 1500, and by <HI>John Vincent</HI> and <HI>Arias Pinco,</HI> who in a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e year 1509. di&s;covered the great River <HI>Maragnan,</HI> reckoned the bigge&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="94">
in the World. Since, <HI>Americus Ve&s;pu|ceus,</HI> and others, made a fuller di&s;co|very of tho&s;e Countries. In the year 1542, the French Captain <HI>Oregliane,</HI> &s;ent by <HI>Gonzale-Pizarro</HI> the Spaniard, found out the River which comes from the Province <HI>Atunquixo,</HI> thirty Leagues from the South Sea. He parted from <HI>Peru,</HI> and followed this River, de&s;cending above 400 Leagues in a &s;treight Line to its Mouth, and more than 1700 with the turn|ings and windings, finding many Peopled I&s;lands.</P>
<P>He was eight months in this Na|vigation, with a thou&s;and Perils and Incommodities; and reported, that he had found (upon a certain Rivulet here) Women Archers, which are of the <HI>Amazons:</HI> The Spaniards had Wars with them.</P>
<P>Before this, <HI>Columbus</HI> in his &s;econd Voyage had di&s;covered the&s;e <HI>Amazons</HI> in an I&s;le, which the Indians call <HI>Ma|dannina</HI> or <HI>Martinina.</HI> This Captain <HI>Oregliane</HI> gave his name to this great River of the <HI>Amazons,</HI> which he took for <HI>Maragnan,</HI> as the modern Navigators &s;eem to agree: And indeed, they who
<PB N="78" REF="95">
were in the year 1612. in the Coun|try of the <HI>Toupinambous,</HI> and in the I&s;le of <HI>Maragnan,</HI> report, That there is no River there of this Name, but only a Creek or Bay, in which is this I&s;le of <HI>Maragnan:</HI> This Name hath perhaps been the cau&s;e that this River towards <HI>Oregliane,</HI> or that of the <HI>Ama|zons,</HI> hath been taken for another River of <HI>Maragnan,</HI> though they are one and the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But to return to our departure from the Country of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> to go towards <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Parting from</HI> Ya|poco.</NOTE> the <HI>Caribes</HI> Man-Eaters, we departed from thence on <HI>Ea&s;ter-Day,</HI> the 15th of <HI>April</HI> in the year 1604. bearing a|long the Coa&s;t, and our Ship running a-ground when&punc; the Tide went out, we were forced to &s;trike Sail, and ca&s;t Anchor until the Sea floated us again. We run all along the Coa&s;t, which is very plea&s;ant, and filled with an infi|nite number of green Trees, which ren|der all the&s;e places very &s;weet and agreeable.</P>
<P>We had no &s;ooner approached the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> than we perceived a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cayenne.</NOTE> Cannoe, which came on board our Ship, and there was in it, one named
<PB N="79" REF="95">
<HI>Yago,</HI> Brother to <HI>Camaria,</HI> King of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes.</NOTE> <HI>Caribes,</HI> who having &s;pied the Nephew <NOTE PLACE="marg">Camaria.</NOTE> of <HI>Anacajoury</HI> whom we had in our Ship, was mightily &s;urpri&s;ed at fir&s;t, not knowing what to think of our coming with this <HI>Yapoco</HI> their Sworn Enemy. Neverthele&s;s, he failed not to guide us in this River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> which is very plea&s;ant, and convenient for Ships to abide in, being 5 or 6 Fathoms deep, in &s;ome places more, add others le&s;s. This <HI>Yago</HI> told us, That he knew well enough the King of <HI>Yapoco</HI> was preparing him|&s;elf to come and vi&s;it them, and that they expected him within 3 or 4 days, as their <HI>Toupan</HI> or Devil had told them; which was true: For while we continued there for &s;ome days, at the end of 'em our General &s;ent &s;ome of his Men into the Country, with <HI>Cama|ria</HI> their King; one of my Servants al&s;o went along with them, to procure me &s;ome of the mo&s;t curious and rare Things he could find. Being come to a place where <HI>Camaria</HI> conducted them, 5 or 6 Leagues from thence, they found out, that <HI>Anacajoury</HI> had been there, with his Naval-Army,
<PB N="80" REF="96">
and had wa&s;ted and burnt the Country, and carried away a great number of the Inhabitants from this Coa&s;t, and &s;aw al&s;o how they &s;erved their Enemies, who had been killed upon the place.</P>
<P>They Eating them Roa&s;ted, an <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cannibals <HI>or Man-Eaters.</HI></NOTE> Indian Woman offered a roa&s;ted Hand to our General, but he angrily refu&s;ed it.</P>
<P>Our General had already&punc; been a|mong&s;t them in the fir&s;t Voyage, but having &s;een &s;ome of their Cruelties, would go there no more, yet he &s;ent &s;ome of his men, as I have &s;aid be|fore:</P>
<P>My Servant being returned, told me, they made great lamentations at <HI>Camaria</HI> for the lo&s;s they had &s;uffered; and that <HI>Camaria</HI> thereupon was trou|bled in &s;uch a manner, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to appea&s;e him; yet he comforted them as well as he could, promi&s;ing to order the Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o as to get into his Hands <HI>Yapoco</HI> the King <HI>Anacajoury</HI>'s Nephew, to make a So|lemn Fea&s;t of him; and that they &s;hould e're long have Revenge upon their Enemies, whom they would with
<PB N="81" REF="96">
Joy Fea&s;t upon at their Plea&s;ure. There was an Indian Woman, who, knowing my Servant was a Surgeon, entreated him to Cure her of a blow of a Sword, &s;he had received upon her Head: But he perceiving that the Skull was &s;plit, and the Brains to be &s;een, told her freely he could give her no help. There were &s;everal others wounded, to whom he did what help he was able.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t he was among&s;t them, he told me, that one Night retiring with them into their Cabbins, (made of Branches of Palms) he &s;aw the Cere|monies ob&s;erved to their Husbands and Friends who had been killed in the fight.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, An Indian Woman, &s;itting upon her <HI>Amica,</HI> or Hanging-Bed, be|gan a Song, very plea&s;ant and agree|able, which continued a long time. That done, &s;he came to reckon up the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies of the Dead.</NOTE> Exploits of her Dead Husband, how he had Loved her, been Valiant again&s;t his Enemies, excellent in Drawing the Bow, able to undergo all the Hard&s;hips of War, and a thou&s;and other Gallantries and Perfections, of
<PB N="82" REF="97">
which &s;he gave a particular account. After that, one of the&s;e Indians rai&s;ed him&s;elf from his <HI>Amica,</HI> and went to de&s;ire the others to lament; where|upon they pre&s;ently fell to Howling &s;o &s;trangely, that one would have thought them to be out of their Wits. The&s;e Lamentations ended, they ro&s;e up to make Merry with the Fle&s;h of their Enemies, with &s;ome Lizards and Crocodiles intermix'd, and all roa&s;ted together, thus Fea&s;ting upon the Graves of their Husbands and dead Friends, thinking them&s;elves thus to have obliged them. Thus much, my Servant told me, he had taken notice of concerning their Ceremonies to their departed Friends.</P>
<P>In the mean time we Equipped our Boat, the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> to go to find out the end of the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and know from whence it comes, and takes its head. We had with us two <HI>Indians,</HI> to &s;hew us &s;ome Bra&s;il, where|of they make their Bows, and having taken with us a Barrel of Liquor, and &s;ome Bi&s;quet for Victuals, we &s;pent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coa&s;t of the River of</HI> Cayenne <HI>and Voyage upon it.</HI></NOTE> all the re&s;t of the day and the night in rowing along the Coa&s;t, which
<PB N="83" REF="97">
is very plea&s;ant; and there are a thou|&s;and &s;everal &s;orts of Birds making &s;uch a noi&s;e, that it is a very dreadful thing to hear them.</P>
<P>There is in every place a great num|ber of Flies, like unto a &s;ort of Gnats, which are very trouble&s;ome, and tor|mented us mightily both night and day, but e&s;pecially in the night time. The next morning we arrived at the end of this River, &s;eeing a violent Stream that de&s;cended from a Moun|tain into a Valley, where it is below like a Lake, then comes to pa&s;s upon a Rock very flat and broad, and from thence falleth down as into a hollow Ditch, which groweth wider by lit|tle and little, until it ca&s;teth it &s;elf into the Sea; the Tide comes up to the place where it beginneth to fall. We found no great matter in this Voyage, except &s;everal &s;orts of &s;trange Creatures, and Indian-Hens of ano|ther &s;ort than tho&s;e of our <HI>Europe:</HI> The old ones carry their young, and would not fly away, &s;eeing us, but were very tame. The&s;e Hens have Feathers upon their Heads which are black and very beautiful, and like
<PB N="84" REF="98">
to tho&s;e of a Heron. We carried &s;ome of them to our Ship, but we could not pre&s;erve them all until we came into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, we found all this Coa&s;t De&s;art; and being returned on Board, we told what we had &s;een in this Voyage: Our General &s;ent us again to di&s;cover another River, which &s;e|parates it &s;elf from that of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> and runs towards the South-Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>We prepared our Boat, with &s;ome Indians, thinking it had not been ve|ry far off, or el&s;e not well under&s;tand|ing our Interpreters, in&s;omuch that we took not Victuals enough with us, only I furni&s;hed my &s;elf with &s;ome Bi&s;quet, acd gave of it to one of our Indians, who was very glad of this Provi&s;ion that I had made.</P>
<P>Having then Rowed a good way up into this River, we found nothing but Branches of Trees, which co|vered in a manner all the pa&s;&s;age, &s;o that we were forced ever and anon to lie all along in the Boat, to pa&s;s un|derneath the&s;e Branches of Trees, which were laded with Oy&s;ters. At la&s;t we came to a certain place where
<PB N="85" REF="98">
there were Trees cut down by the Peo|ple of &s;ome Ships that had been there before us. The&s;e were exceeding <NOTE PLACE="marg">Red-Wood.</NOTE> great, and the Heart very red like unto Bra&s;il, yet it was not &s;o as I have experienced it.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Indian whom I had given the Bi&s;quet to, did not mind to follow our Men, but &s;ought for &s;omething to live upon, and came again pre&s;ently towards me, &s;hewing me by Signs, he had found &s;omething good for us, and went to find out the Wooden-Bowl of the Boat, which &s;erved only to ca&s;t out the Water; &s;o led only me along with him, a good way into the Wood, to a Tree cut down, which was hollow, and had in it a Bee-Hive, the mo&s;t excellent, clear, &s;weet and agreeable that could be imagined. This Honey was of a Jelly, like Oil, and exceeding clear, of a greeni&s;h colour, and enclo&s;ed in Bags, like tho&s;e great Pur&s;es the Mer|chants u&s;e, wherein there is &s;everal lit|tle Leather ones. There the Honey is environ'd with a Membrane or Skin, which is the <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> very clear: When this little Skin is broke, the Honey
<PB N="86" REF="99">
comes out of this only, and not the others; &s;o the Indian broke one after another, throwing the Honey into the Bowl, which he gave me to drink of as a choice Liquor.</P>
<P>Having taken &s;ome of it in this manner, he went to look for Water to mix with it, to the end that we might have the more of it, as al&s;o to quench our Thir&s;t the better.</P>
<P>In the mean time our Companions were in another place, on the other &s;ide of this Wood, &s;eeking for the Bra&s;il-Trees. I &s;aved &s;ome of this Honey in the Bowl, not having el&s;e|where to put it: But our Thir&s;ty Peo|ple returning&punc; from this Wood, and taking the Bowl to Drink, mixed Water with the Honey, and &s;o drank it up; which cau&s;ed me to Quarrel with out Carpenter who had done it on purpo&s;e, like a Man of his Coun|try, where they are born to Envy and Malice. I bore the lo&s;s of this Honey, &s;o excellent, as patiently as po&s;&s;ibly I could, becau&s;e our Lieutenant was there, who had not a mind to do what this bold Carpenter did, but
<PB N="87" REF="99">
had taken Water with his Hand out of the River to Drink.</P>
<P>I could never &s;ince find any more of this &s;weet Liquor, by whatever Signs I could make to the King of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> to cau&s;e him to under|&s;tand what it was; for he did not know the name of it. But what I wondered at mo&s;t, was, that this In|dian could &s;o ea&s;ily find out this Ho|ney in the&s;e Woods, &s;eperating him|&s;elf from the others for that rea&s;on. If I could have &s;aved only 3 or 4 Ounces of it, I would not have parted with it for any thing what&s;omever, but would preciou&s;ly have pre&s;erved it, to make a Pre&s;ent thereof to the late King my dear Ma&s;ter; as I gave him &s;ome of that which I brought from <HI>Africa,</HI> which he found of an excellent Ta&s;te, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Honey of</HI> Africa.</NOTE> and cau&s;ed me to lay it carefully up in his Trunk, as they do in the &s;ame Country from whence I had brought it. This Honey of <HI>Africa</HI> was as white as Snow, clear, and of an ex|cellent good Ta&s;te; al&s;o the King confe&s;&s;ed, that he had never before &s;een any &s;o excellent: But that was but cour&s;e Honey in compari&s;on to
<PB N="88" REF="100">
this of the Country of the <HI>Caribes.</HI> The Bees which make this Honey in the <HI>We&s;t-Indians,</HI> are of a pale and yellowi&s;h colour, little and harmle&s;s, and are not trouble&s;ome at all, as I found out in the place whence I took this Honey, which was like to a mo&s;t precious Balm, and I believe, that as the Honey of <HI>Africa</HI> is excellent for Healing of Wounds, &s;o this of the <HI>Indies</HI> quite exceeds it every way, as in its con&s;i&s;tence, ta&s;te, &s;mell and colour.</P>
<P>Being then returned from this Ri|ver, where we could di&s;cover nothing to &s;erve our turn, our General was re&s;olved to &s;end me vvith the King <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Voyage to the Ca|ribes.</NOTE> of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> to go to their Habita|tions, and look in the Woods, to &s;ee if vve could there find a certain Tree, vvhich is a &s;ort of Wood of Aloes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aloes Wood.</NOTE> called by them <HI>Apariebou,</HI> for vve had found of it in the Country of <HI>Yaposo.</HI> For this effect, I parted the 29th of <HI>April,</HI> vvith <HI>Cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ria,</HI> the King of the <HI>Caribes,</HI> vvho had left in Ho&s;tage for me 7 or 8 of his Indians, and Em|barked in a Cannoe, with vvhich vve entered into a little River, vvhich
<PB N="89" REF="100">
runs about two Leagues up into the Country, and was very narrow, the Branches of Trees quite covering it, &s;o that we had a thou&s;and Inconve|niencies, and much ado to lie flat down in the Boat to avoid 'em. The Indians being &s;tark Naked did not matter it &s;o much; for if the&s;e Branches had made them tumble in|to the River, they knew &s;o well how to Swim, that they would not have much needed to fear: That which did us the mo&s;t harm, was, that &s;ome of the&s;e Branches were laden with cer|tain Oy&s;ters, little, and of the colour <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oysters.</NOTE> of Pearls, of a very good Ta&s;te; for I was willing to try, opening &s;ome before the&s;e Indians, who wondered mightily to &s;ee me open 'em &s;o ea&s;ily, not knowing how to do it.</P>
<P>We went thus Rowing along to find out their Dwellings, that at la&s;t coming to the end of the River, we went on Shore, and about a League and a half from thence, we &s;aw one of their Habitations, and the <HI>Caribes</HI> came about us, offering to their King, Fruit, and other Things to Eat, with which he al&s;o pre&s;ented me&punc; After

that, we left this Habitation and con|tinued our way towards that of <HI>Cama|ria:</HI> When we were come to the foot of a Mountain, this King fell a crying out as loud as he could, and de&s;ired me al&s;o to do the like, which I did, and I believe that it was to call home all tho&s;e who were about the Woods, becau&s;e thereupon they pre&s;ently re|turned to the Habitation; for I &s;aw them run from all parts to their place, which was in a Valley, where being come, I found a great number of <HI>Ca|ribes,</HI> Men and Women; among&s;t the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> King of the</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> others, the Wife of <HI>Camaria,</HI> who was making an Amica or Bed of Cotton. All the&s;e Indians, Men and Women, naked as they were, came running to &s;ee me and my Companion, a young Carpenter of our Ship, who was un|der a mortal apprehen&s;ion that they would Eat him, de&s;iring me mightily to give them &s;omething of that which I had brought to exchange with them&punc; Then I commanded them to make <HI>Ovato Courende,</HI> which is to &s;ay, a good Fire, becau&s;e we had been Wet with the Rain, by the way, which the In|dians did not much matter, being

not much&punc; troubled to dry their own Cloaths: They pre&s;ently made me a a Fire, it being very late at night, &s;o that we were pretty well dried in this great Hall where all the&s;e Indians were; and thus we Supped with the King and his Wife, in the &s;ight of all the others: They made mighty much of us with their Savage Victuals. I had brought a Bottle of Wine and &s;ome Bi&s;quet with me, which was no &s;mall help to us, after &s;o many Fa|tigues by the way, trouble&s;ome with Water and Woods, where &s;ometimes the Indians were forced to carry me upon their Backs in certain places that were very hollow.</P>
<P>After Supper, the King cau&s;ed us <NOTE PLACE="marg">Amacas <HI>or Hanging Beds.</HI></NOTE> to retire into his Hou&s;e, where he or|dered two Amica's or Beds to be hung up for me and my Companion. They had put my Bed &s;o, that it joyned to the King's, and my Companion's a lit|tle higher; and that of the Queen's was on the &s;ame &s;ide with the King's; and all the night there was Guards which kept a Fire near the King and me. Our poor Carpenter did nothing el&s;e but tremble all the night long,
<PB N="92" REF="102">
thinking every moment they were coming to Eat us.</P>
<P>The King <HI>Camaria</HI> in the mean <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>King</HI> Ca|maria.</NOTE> time began to di&s;cour&s;e with me of the King of <HI>Yapoco,</HI> whom he &s;aid he did not fear, and who had come up into one of his Rivers, where he had killed a great number of his People; but that he de&s;ired mightily, (if it was po&s;&s;ible) to have in his Clutches, his Nephew <HI>Yapoco,</HI> who was in our Ship, and that I &s;hould &s;peak thereof to our General, and u&s;e my utmo&s;t Policy and Endeavour to have him delivered up, that he might be Eaten, &s;aying that he would &s;end for all his Subjects and his Friends to be at this Fea&s;t of the <HI>Caripou.</HI></P>
<P>As for my part, when he talked to me after this manner, I would not con|tradict him, but gave him the hearing, and promi&s;ed, if I could, to do all he de&s;ired: And he told me that he would willingly give all he had to have this poor <HI>Yapoco,</HI> and that I would take care to have him delivered up, which I dur&s;t not refu&s;e him.</P>
<P>I thought this Night very long, &s;eeing al&s;o that the Queen, Wife of
<PB N="93" REF="102">
<HI>Camaria</HI> did not &s;leep. I ro&s;e up two or three times to go out of the Hou&s;e, continually &s;u&s;pecting the Malice and Cruelty of the&s;e <HI>Anthropaphages,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Anthropo|phages, <HI>or</HI> Cannibals.</NOTE> Eaters of Human Fle&s;h: Be&s;ides that, I perceived in the middle of this Hou&s;e, a Toad of the &s;trange and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wonderful Toad.</NOTE> mo&s;t horrible bigne&s;s that ever I &s;aw; and I believe that it was rather &s;ome Devil than a Toad, becau&s;e <HI>Camaria</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caribes <HI>&s;peak with the Devil.</HI></NOTE> often &s;poke with the Devil, to know what their Enemies were doing.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as it was day, I pre&s;ently ro&s;e up to know what we had to do, and <HI>Camaria</HI> &s;hewed me his Throat, which was very much out of order by a Cold that he had.</P>
<P>I carried him with me into the Woods to &s;eek for Herbs fit for his Di&s;ea&s;e, and u&s;ed my utmo&s;t to pro|cure &s;ome Honey to compo&s;e a Re|medy for him; but he could neither under&s;tand me, or comprehend what I demanded of him. At la&s;t, having Break|fa&s;ted, we went along with &s;ome In|dians to look for Wood of Aloes. This is a Tree of an extraordinary bigne&s;s, bearing Leaves like a Fig-Tree, but a little greener: The Tree contains in
<PB N="94" REF="103">
its Heart a black Wood, very oiley, &s;harp, and of a very good Odour; And a Tree as big as a Tunn &s;hall have in its Heart but a very little quantity of this black Wood. This Tree is very hard, and where it is black, 'twill &s;ink to the bottom of Water like a Stone. We laded thereof about 35 Tuns, which are 70000 pound weight or thereabouts. We laded Store of 2 or 3 other &s;orts of Wood, one re|&s;embling a Red-Sandal, and the other a Cittern, and partly of the &s;ame Odour. It is of a very &s;weet Scent when fir&s;t cut, but by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of time it comes to lo&s;e its Odour. I have learnt that this black Wood is certainly a &s;ort of Wood of Aloes, but not &s;o &s;weet-&s;cented as that of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> becau&s;e it comes &s;o far upon the Sea, receiving thereby a certain Salti&s;h quality. But at &s;uch time as I was at <HI>Goa,</HI> being in an En&s;arail where the Idolaters Work, I there &s;aw &s;ome Wood of Aloes of the River of <HI>Ganges,</HI> which was &s;weet, and had almo&s;t the &s;ame qualities as that of the We&s;t, as I &s;ince found out by curious <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Virtue of the Wood of</HI> Aloes.</NOTE> Experience. The Gentiles told me
<PB N="95" REF="103">
that this Wood was very excellent and odoriferous, and neither Rotten nor Worm-eaten, and was chiefly a good Remedy for the Head-Ach, or the Ague. For the Head-Ach, you mu&s;t rub this Wood again&s;t a flat Marble, agitating it with Ro&s;e-Water, or com|mon; then rub the Forehead there|with. And for the Ague, drink Water thus agitated, taking 2 or 3 Ounces. This Virtue is not found in that Wood of Aloes which is brought us, becau&s;e it is quite Rotten and Worm-eaten, having in it no other Virtue but for the Perfumes, and very little for Medicine; So that I advi&s;e all curious Apothecaries to chu&s;e for the good and right Wood of Aloes, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>True Wood of</HI> Aloes.</NOTE> which is &s;harp, joined with a certain bitterne&s;s. As for the colour, the be&s;t is that which is black, enclined to grey with Veins, very hard and ponderous, rendering a &s;weet-&s;cent in the burning, and above all very Gummy. The&s;e are the marks of the be&s;t as far as I could take notice of in my Travels. I know very well that the price thereof is a little high, and that is the rea&s;on why it is &s;o
<PB N="96" REF="104">
&s;eldom kept in Shops, where they have in&s;tead thereof the Sandal-Cittern, which is of a quite contrary Faculty and Vertue: And &s;o likewi&s;e of the Turbit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Which is a Root.</NOTE>, of which they chu&s;e more of that which is white, light and falling to Powder in the breaking, (than the grey) which is of a &s;weet &s;cent, gummy and heavy, which is the good and right, as I have &s;een at <HI>Goa,</HI> where they gather it. The Indians them&s;elves never make u&s;e of any other &s;ort than the grey in|clining to white; but one Dram of that will make more in effect than three of the other; and I believe that this white is not the right Tur|bit, never having &s;een any &s;uch in the <HI>Indies,</HI> but that it rather comes from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> becau&s;e 'tis brought from <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Alexandria</HI> by the Caravans which come from <HI>Babi|lon.</HI> Thus much can I &s;ay at pre|&s;ent of the right Turbit. As for the re&s;t, the Indians call this Wood of Aloes <HI>Aupariebou.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="104">
We gathered then together, in the River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> &s;tore of this Wood of Aloes, which was very good and excellent: but the quantity that hath been found thereof, greater than has been hitherto &s;een, hath been the cau&s;e that it is not &s;o much e&s;teemed as formerly; yet neverthe|le&s;s the able and learned Apotheca|ries of <HI>Tours, Poitiers, Angiers, Ro|chelle,</HI> and other Cities, have bought it of me at ten, fifteen, and twenty Sols the Ounce. I believe that if this Wood of Aloes of the We&s;t was dryed and cut twenty or thir|ty years, like that of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> where the be&s;t grows, that it would very much re&s;emble it in Virtue, Colour, and Odour: But in regard I brought it green as it was, the ignorant Apothecaries thought it was not the right Wood of Aloes.</P>
<P>But to return to this River of <HI>Ca|yenne,</HI> there is, in the middle of it, a little I&s;land, about 100 Paces in com|pa&s;s, where a great number of Birds, from all parts thereabouts, come to
<PB N="98" REF="105">
take their re&s;t at night; and among&s;t others, &s;ome of tho&s;e beautiful Birds have Carnation Feathers quite to the Bill: and having a mind to carry &s;ome of them alive with me into <HI>France,</HI> I &s;trewed Bird-lime all over this little I&s;land, (for I had brought 9 or 10 Pounds of it from <HI>France)</HI> and the next day &s;ome of our Men went there, who found a great number of them taken; But as the ill fortune would have it, they tarried not till I could &s;ee them, (for I was then in the Ship) but Eat them all up, like Gluttons as they were, which I was mightily vexed at.</P>
<P>The&s;e Birds are of the bigne&s;s of a Crane, and are at fir&s;t of a Dove co|lour, then in growing, change by lit|tle and little into a Carnation: The Indians make their Garments of them, and Crowns of Feathers for their Heads: And it is a fine &s;ight to &s;ee them thus array'd, painting al&s;o their Bodies with <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Zinzolin, <HI>or Red the colour of the</HI> Indians.</NOTE> a reddi&s;h colour, which is that they u&s;e to Paint them&s;elves withall: This is made of a little Seed inclo&s;ed in a Ve&s;&s;el of the Fa&s;hion of

<HI>Alquequangi,</HI> a little Plant which grows commonly in the Vinyards; They are called <HI>Coquelourdes,</HI> and are filled full with the&s;e little red Seeds, where|with they Paint them&s;elves.</P>
<P>In the mean time, we &s;et the&s;e <HI>Caribes</HI> to work, and employed them in looking out the Wood of Aloes, and gave them a Hatchet or Bill for a piece or two of this Wood; and when they had prepared a piece, they came to give me notice of it, to know if it was neat, and peeled of from the white Wood which is round about it, and hath in it neither Force nor Virtue.</P>
<P>They &s;et &s;everal Men to trail a piece of this Wood to the Sea &s;ide; for it is very heavy: Then they cho&s;e which they liked be&s;t, a Hatchet or a Bill, to exchange for their Wood. I &s;aw one of the&s;e <HI>Caribes,</HI> who was mightily puzzel'd, and in great doubt, which of the two he &s;hould chu&s;e, and was a long time con&s;idering and pau&s;ing with him&s;elf which would be the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for him; at la&s;t,
<PB N="100" REF="106">
after having well con&s;idered and be|thought him&s;elf, he took the Hatchet, &s;eeing he who gave it him began to be angry for his &s;tanding &s;o long about it. They brought us al&s;o, to Sell, an abundance of Fruits, as Anano's and Plantins, which are long Figs, and as big as a Cervela, with Patato's, and other Things good to Eat; Al&s;o &s;ome <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cervelas.</NOTE> Crocodiles, and a &s;ort of an Animal, armed with a Coat, which the Spa|niards call, <HI>Armadille.</HI> I made the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Armadille</NOTE> Di&s;&s;ection of a Crocodile, and Eat &s;ome of it's Fle&s;h, which is pretty good, only it is a little &s;weet and un&s;avory, though I had well Salted and Spiced it.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o in exchange, of them&punc; another &s;ort of a Creature, which is a kind of an Ape or Marmot, but <NOTE PLACE="marg">Apis.</NOTE> more Arch and Rogui&s;h, and with a very long Tail.</P>
<P>The Indians &s;ay that this Bea&s;t carries her young ones upon her Back when &s;he has ca&s;t them out of her Belly, and goes jumping from Tree to Tree with them upon her Reins;
<PB N="101" REF="106">
and when any one of them is ready to fall, &s;he holds them up with her Tail.</P>
<P>This Animal makes &s;uch a noi&s;e about the Woods, that when they are together tho' never &s;o few, you would &s;ay there were a hundred Hogs a kill|ing.</P>
<P>That which I bought was Dead, and co&s;t me a little Horn: It was a Female, having two Teats in the Sto|mach like a Woman. The Indians had taken it with the Bow, and it had a &s;troke with an Arrow in the Belly, and carried one of her young ones upon her Back; which they brought us to Sell for a Hatchet. This little one, being in our Ship, howled after &s;uch manner, that it made us all quite Deaf; it died afterward, for it would not Eat.</P>
<P>There happened to be a Monkey at that time in our Ship, and this Crea|ture catching fa&s;t hold about its mid|dle, griped it &s;o hard, that the poor Monkey could not &s;hake it off, running about the Cordage from one &s;ide to another, and endeavouring with his Paws to make her fall, but in vain.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="107">
We had another Animal, the &s;trange&s;t that can be imagined; for it had a very long Beard, the Head &s;et up very high, and the Legs very long, with three Paws behind and two before: It kept it &s;elf continu|ally in a Ball, not being able to &s;tand upon its Legs. We tied a Rope cro&s;s the Ship, and then put this Bea&s;t up|on it, but &s;he continued always in a round&punc; like a Ball. That which was given it to Eat, &s;he took in her Paw like a Monkey, and &s;o put it in her Mouth. We had many &s;trange Creatures, which it would be too long and tedious, to give a particu|lar account of.</P>
<P>I return then to &s;ome Manners and Fa&s;hions that I have ob&s;erved among&s;t the&s;e <HI>Caribes.</HI> A little be|fore our departure from this River of <HI>Cayenne,</HI> we &s;aw one day the&s;e <HI>Ca|ribes,</HI> leading a new Bride about the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Manner of the</HI> Caribes <HI>in their Marriages.</HI></NOTE> Woods with a very great noi&s;e, and pur&s;ued and killed all that they found about the Fore&s;t. Then they came to the Sea &s;ide to &s;ee our Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="107">
The&s;e are People of a very good Stature, and Plump. They &s;at down upon the Bank of the River to view our Ship at their lei&s;ure&punc; This Bride was there, all alone, with a company of the&s;e Savages, and having continued there &s;ome time to &s;ee us&punc; with Ad|miration, &s;he again ro&s;e up&punc; then the others conducted her about the Woods as before: Thus they lead about their Wives&punc; their Kindred, and Friends. As I kept Watch one night upon the Deck, I &s;aw the&s;e <HI>Caribes</HI> upon a high Mountain keeping al&s;o Watch, and Sounding with a Horn very loud; then all the other Habitations an&s;wered, in the &s;ame manner, every hour of the night&punc; After that they made a clear Fire, which they pre&s;ently put out again&punc; They do all this that they might be thought not to Sleep; for they mightily fear their Enemies the <HI>Caripous&punc;</HI></P>
<P>Now our Ship being laden with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another Voyage of the Author.</NOTE> as many Commodities as we were well able to procure, and being ready to &s;et Sail, I took a Re&s;olution, the 17th of <HI>May,</HI> to go once again towards their Habitations with &s;ome
<PB N="104" REF="108">
&s;mall Ware, as Knives, Combs, and other Things; and gave all the&s;e to an Indian, to carry in a little Basket, who was wonderfully plea&s;ed to fol|low me; but he, being &s;ubtile and &s;ly, would not march before me, &s;ay|ing, that it did not belong to him to go fir&s;t; which made me not a little wonder that this Indian could know what Honour was due to another; But, the Ra&s;cal did it, that he might the more ea&s;ily put his Hand into my Basket and &s;harp &s;omething out; I perceived it happily, turning my &s;elf about, and &s;o caught him in the very act; upon which I &s;hewed him gent|ly that <HI>that</HI> was neither hand&s;ome nor well done: He excu&s;ed him&s;elf as well as he could and then went before me until he found in the Wood a little Way or Path, on the right Hand, which went &s;traight to his Habitati|on, and then he returned me my Bas|ket, not being able to retain him for all I could do; I gave him a Comb, for his Labour, of which he was very glad. I do not know but that he had ca&s;t &s;omething a&s;ide of what he had taken out of my Basket.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="108">
I proceeded on my way untill I came to a high Mountain where there were, a great number of <HI>Caribes,</HI> with their Wives and Children: There by chance I found the Indian, our Inter|preter, who helped me mightily in making my Bargains, for what I wanted, as well for Parrots as other kind of Animals. Having exchanged what I de&s;ir'd the&s;e Indians led me into another Habitation, where I &s;aw, <HI>Yapoira,</HI> the Brother <HI>Caribe</HI> of <HI>Atupa</HI> who was in our Ship: He was upon <NOTE PLACE="marg">Yapoira.</NOTE> the top of one of their Hou&s;es of Palm, and as &s;oon as he perceiv'd me, he ca&s;t him&s;elf down, and came to embrace me, remembring that <HI>I</HI> had given him a Hatchet when he had broke his own in our Service.</P>
<P>He &s;poke to me of his Brother <HI>A|toupa</HI> and that his Mother had no more than this little Boy who was all her Comfort; That the <HI>Caripous</HI> had killed all his Brothers and Si&s;ters, and that, if our General would let him return to his Mother, he him&s;elf was content to go with us into <HI>France. I</HI> told that he &s;hould go along with me, to make his Remon&s;trances, which
<PB N="106" REF="109">
he did: <HI>I</HI> asked him for &s;ome Water, which they call <HI>Tonna,</HI> and pre&s;ently he cau&s;ed his Wife to bring me &s;ome, who was of an extraordinary &s;weet Nature, and very hand&s;ome, though &s;he was &s;tark Naked: Having drank&punc; they cau&s;ed me to enter into a great Hall made of Palms, where they keep them&s;elves in the day time, with their Amaca's, to hold Coun&s;el concern|ing the Affairs of War. Then they led me into a certain Hou&s;e where there was a great many Women and Girls &s;tark naked; and put &s;ome Pa|tato's upon the Fire for me to Eat; and having made &s;ome exchange, as well&punc; for Mace and Patato's, as Gums, which is a black Bitume which they Chaulk <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gums.</NOTE> their Cannoes with, <HI>I</HI> laded 2 or 3 Indians, and &s;o we returned, towards the Port, to our Ship. I had a great deal of trouble in returning back be|cau&s;e the&s;e Savages led me through the Wood where there was a great many Waters to pa&s;s; be&s;ides it rained, and was very bad Weather. After we had gone 2 or 3 Leagues of this bad way, we came to the end of a little River, and found a Cannoe on
<PB N="107" REF="109">
Land that wanted only to be &s;et a Float, but we had no Oars; yet the&s;e Indians looked &s;o&punc; long among&s;t the Herbs that at la&s;t they found out &s;ome that were hid. The&s;e Oars are very little, and like to a Battle-dore which they beat Hemp withall.</P>
<P>Being thus Embark'd, we Rowed &s;o hard that we &s;oon arrived at our Ship, where they waited for me with great earne&s;tne&s;s, not knowing where I &s;hould be kept out &s;o late, and they were to have &s;et &s;ail the next morn|ing, as we did.</P>
<P>But before we come out of this Country, I will not forget, that a|mong&s;t other Rarities that grow there, there are certain Gums to be found, called <HI>Copal,</HI> and <HI>Anime,</HI> and certain <NOTE PLACE="marg">Animes <HI>Gums.</HI></NOTE> Bitum, or black Gum, very Odorife|rous when it is put upon the Fire; It is al&s;o good for the Rhume, by recei|ving the Smoak of it; the &s;ame is al|&s;o the <HI>Anime,</HI> which is a Gum, yellow and tran&s;parent, like the Gums of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and is found in great Tears.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Copal,</HI> it hath not this quality, but it &s;erves for <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Swellings.</NOTE> Apo&s;t|humes, to ripen and heal them, &s;o

they come from a cold Cau&s;e and Phlegm. For, as for tho&s;e which come from Heat and Blood, the <HI>Copal</HI> is not &s;o proper to apply, being it is hot. This <HI>Copal</HI> is a White Gum, en|clining to gray: The Tree which bears it is like to a Lawrel in its Leaves, but 'tis bigger in the Trunk, and hath al&s;o young ones. I picked out &s;ome of this Gum, by making an Inci&s;ion in the Tree; then the next morning, or two days after, I found the Gum pure and clear upon the &s;lit. The <HI>Anime</HI> is gotten after the &s;ame manner, and its Tree al&s;o re&s;embles the other. As for the Bitum, or black Gum, it comes from a place where there are Springs of Water, and it is gathered, mixed with Earth at the foot of certain Trees among&s;t Green Mo&s;s. The Indians make u&s;e of it, in&s;tead of Pitch, to Chalk their Can|noes.</P>
<P>As for the Language of the&s;e Peo|ple, I will only &s;ay, that it is of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Language of the</HI> Ca|ribes.</NOTE> &s;everal &s;orts; and that of the <HI>Caripous</HI> is &s;omething different from that which the <HI>Caribes</HI> &s;peak, and have much ado to under&s;tand other, although they are

not far di&s;tant.

<P>The next morning the 29th of <HI>May</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyage into the I&s;le.</NOTE> we cau&s;ed our Boat to be Equipped to go on Shore, and to &s;eek &s;ome Water: Our Men after Breakfa&s;t, went thus away, with their Muskets and Pikes, without the lea&s;t drop of Water along with them; but they payed dear for it: For after having gone a good way up into this I&s;land, with the heat of the Sun and running after the Goats, they were &s;o wonderful dry and thir&s;ty that, they thought, they &s;hould all have Died for want of a little Water; and returning again with great Trouble and Fatigue, they were forced to carry the weake&s;t upon their Shoul|ders:

The&s;e Creatures, not being u&s;ed to be Hunted after this manner, made a horrible noi&s;e and bellowing; and though they were Shot quit through the Body, yet they did not fall for that, but fled away with a light pace.

<P>We went thus three or four Leagues without finding any Water, at which our Companions were mightily a&s;to|ni&s;hed, and deceived as well as tho&s;e the day before: For we had nothing at all to quench our Thir&s;t, amid&s;t &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive heat of the Sun: As for me, I had carried in my Pocket a Coco's or Palm-Nut, full of Liquor, which was no &s;mall help to me at this time, and I believe without that, I &s;hould had much ado to have returned. Our Carpenter was forced to &s;tay be|hind, earne&s;tly de&s;iring me to tarry with him; But it was not my inten|tion to lie in the&s;e De&s;arts; be&s;ides, the Ship was to &s;et Sail the next morn|ing, which gave me the more courage to return the &s;ame day. After ha|ving thus rambled about, and run from one &s;ide to the other, at la&s;t we came under a great Tree, where we &s;at down in the Shade to take our re&s;t.

As &s;oon as our Men were awake, I gave them an account of what had hap|pened,

and made &s;o many Cour&s;es about this I&s;land, that I caught two of the&s;e Lizards, whereof I made ve|ry good chear, for the Fle&s;h thereof is pretty good; I kept their Skins to carry away with me. This Crea|ture is of a very hard Life, for after having taken, and leaving them for Dead, yet they from time to time come to move and &s;tart up, &s;o that carrying them in a Napkin, I thought to let them fall every moment. After we had repo&s;ed our &s;elves a little un|der this Tree, we took our way to|wards the other &s;ide of the Sea, find|ing a little beaten Path which went towards the&s;e <HI>Cabrettes,</HI> thinking that it was the way, where they went to look for Water to Drink; but after having gone about a League of this way, we found in a flat ground, a great place where the&s;e <HI>Cabrettes</HI> came to take their re&s;t, for the place was mightily beaten. We &s;aw there another Path which went from this place; and hoping that it would lead us to &s;ome Water, we found it brought us to the Sea-&s;ide, where we &s;aw &s;ome Sea-Water upon a Rock, which was

high and flat; it made us glad, think|ing it had been fre&s;h, but ta&s;ting of it we found the contrary, and that it was nothing but the Waves of the Sea which broke again&s;t this Rock, where there always remains &s;ome little of it, be&s;ides the Sun had Congeled it into Salt exceeding clear and pure. Seeing then that we found no Water, it behoved us (tho' with great regret) to take again the way to our Ship, each one &s;eeking the neare&s;t he could, for we went confu|&s;edly, &s;triving who might arrive fir&s;t to quench his Thir&s;t; but the allow|ance we had was not &s;ufficient, not being more than a little Cupfull of Drink, which was &s;ower Citter, with two parts Water, but &s;ome had pro|vided Liquor for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I arrived the third at the Ship, and Bathed my Body in the Sea to refre&s;h my &s;elf, &s;opping al&s;o a little Bisket in the Sea to Eat, and &s;wallowing &s;ome Mouth-fulls thereof. The re&s;t of our Men were tarried behind, and being come there with the Fleming and Scotchman, we called the Boat<HI>:</HI> But the Ship being above a League and a

The morning being come, his Seamen was commanded to take a Shovel, with other Mariners who knew pretty nigh the place where they had left him, and went thus &s;eeking about the&s;e De&s;arts,

</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>BOOK III.</HEAD>
<P>THE Voyage that I had made the former year to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> had left me &s;uch a de|&s;ire to &s;ee al&s;o the re&s;t of the World, that I was re&s;olved to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> if I found any fit opportunity: For this effect, I parted from <HI>Paris</HI> the 12th of <HI>April</HI> 1605. and taking
<PB N="140" REF="126">
my way &s;traight to <HI>Britagne,</HI> I went to Embark at <HI>St. Lezer, (St. Nazare)</HI> in a Ship of <HI>Poligain,</HI> where we were not above twenty Per&s;ons in all.</P>
<P>We were at the beginning of this Voyage &s;o beaten with contrary Winds, that we were forced to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Galice,</HI> a little below Cape <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> Vere.</HI> Having continued there for &s;ome time, we &s;et &s;ail with the Wind, and arrived at <HI>Lisbon</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> at &s;uch time as they were Rejoycing for the Birth of an Infant of <HI>Spain;</HI> which was a very fine &s;ight. For after ha|ving <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rejoycing at</HI> Lisbon.</NOTE> a long time run the Bulls, accor|ding to their manner of Pa&s;time, where there was a great many Hor&s;es maimed, and Cavalliers overturned <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lamed.</NOTE> to the Ground, they laded a Bull with Crackers, but there was &s;uch a great number of them on him, that he fell down under the Burthen; and they were forced to fetch a &s;trong Ox to carry them, and yet he &s;toop'd under &s;o heavy a Load: The&s;e Crackers were fa&s;tened one to another, &s;o that they covered all the Body of this Ox; then there was others tied to his Horns. When the Fea&s;t was ended, fire was
<PB N="141" REF="126">
put to the&s;e Crackers, and then you would have &s;aid, that the Ox flew in the Air, with &s;uch an Impetuo&s;ity, which looked like Lightning; for Ten Thou&s;and Muskets would not have made &s;o great a noi&s;e, each Cracker an&s;wering one another, &s;o that the Ox remained quite roa&s;ted.</P>
<P>I made &s;ome &s;tay at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> upon the hopes that I &s;hould, (as I have &s;aid) <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dutch Ar|my towards</HI> Lisbon.</NOTE> find pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> if the Fleet had gone there that year: But as it was ready to part, the Dutch Fleet came to ca&s;t Anchor about the Bar of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> where they &s;tayed a long time, waiting for the &s;aid Fleet; but the Portugue&s;e were not &s;o fooli&s;h as to venture out. After that, Don <HI>Louis Fajardo,</HI> General of the Army, knowing that the Hollanders were now retired, riged out a Fleet of 35 &s;ail to follow after; and went a good way out into the Sea, &s;ending a little Ship before, called the <HI>Pearl,</HI> (taken from the <HI>Rochellers)</HI> to di&s;cover'em; But this Ve&s;&s;el meeting with the Hollanders, was taken by them, and all the re&s;t returned to the Haven of <HI>Lisbon</HI> without doing any thing.
<PB N="142" REF="127">
Having then lo&s;t this occa&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ing to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> at that time, I was re&s;olved to go to <HI>Barbary,</HI> and for this Cau&s;e Embarked at <HI>Ca&s;cais,</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el belonging to Captain <HI>Poul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t</HI> of <HI>Rochelle.</HI></P>
<P>We bore South Ea&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Voyage in|to</HI> Barba|ry.</NOTE> along by <HI>Azamor,</HI> near to the City of <HI>Lions,</HI> which is a place ruined, having &s;till very high Towers. On Wedne&s;day the 8th day of the month, we ca&s;t Anchor in the Road of <HI>Saffy,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saffy.</NOTE> where I tarried &s;ome time without going on Shore at all: But <HI>Cidi-Hamet Talbe,</HI> or Secretary to the King of <HI>Morocco, Mulei-Boufairs</HI> being come to <HI>Saffy</HI> with his <HI>Almahalle,</HI> or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Alma|halle.</NOTE> little Army, to conduct the Caravan which was come to <HI>Morocco,</HI> and to reconduct the other, which was go|ing there, he &s;ell Sick; and having heard that there was a <HI>Tabibe,</HI> or a Phy&s;itian on board our Ship, he &s;ent &s;ome Moors immediately to fetch me. I went with them on Land, not knowing what they would do with me; and coming there upon the Port, I found this <HI>Cidi-Hamet</HI> &s;itting with a great number of Moors along the
<PB N="143" REF="127">
Walls of the Ca&s;tle; and as &s;oon as he &s;aw me, he ro&s;e up, and taking me by the Hand, led me into his Camp, which was without <HI>Saffy,</HI> in|to his Tent, being very fine, and curiou&s;ly Embroidered with Figures, after the More&s;que. There I found a Jew, which &s;erved for Interpreter in the <HI>Gemique,</HI> (which is Spani&s;h or corrupted Portugue&s;e) which I un|der&s;tood; and having di&s;cour&s;ed with me about his Di&s;ea&s;e, I re&s;olved upon that which I thought be&s;t for his Cure; and for this cau&s;e went on board our Ship to look for Drugs fit for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I Purged him &s;o, that I cau&s;ed him to Vomit up Worms like little Serpents; which made me not a little admire, for they were &s;o very great, and long, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to imagine that &s;uch odious and horrible things could be in Human Bodies: Since that, he was very well and was my great Friend; and he and his <HI>Alcades</HI> &s;hewed me all the kindne&s;s imaginable: He gave me a Hor&s;e to go to <HI>Morocco,</HI> making very much of me by the way.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="128">
Thus we parted from <HI>Saffy</HI> to go to <HI>Morocco,</HI> the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and went to pitch the <HI>Almahalle</HI> near to the <HI>Adouars</HI> or Tents of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and went to &s;ee them with &s;ome Moors their Enemies. The&s;e <HI>Ara|bians</HI> cau&s;ed us to enter into their Tents; then they put &s;ome Carpets&punc; very thick and hairy upon the Ground for us to &s;it upon, and brought us &s;ome Camels Milk to Drink, with I don't know what other things: After that, we retired in the night to the Camp of the Moors, which was not very far from thence.</P>
<P>The next morning we rai&s;ed our Tents, and went to pitch the <HI>Alma|halle</HI> at the <HI>Duguele,</HI> were there is Water. The <HI>Arabians</HI> had made there a great many large and deep Ditches, which they call <HI>Matamores,</HI> in &s;uch manner that it is a very dreadful thing to look to the bottom of them: 'Tis there they find Water; in &s;ome of which there is &s;ome, in others none: And the&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> come to look there for VVater, above 4 or 5 Leagues round about. From the <HI>Puquelle</HI> they come with their Camels, which
<PB N="145" REF="128">
they lade with this VVater, in <HI>Oudres,</HI> or Goat Skins. And when they have Reaped their Corn, they rai&s;e their <HI>Adouars,</HI> or Tents, and go away to &s;ome other place far di&s;tant from thence, leaving this Ground to lie wa&s;te a long time<HI>:</HI> Then afterwards, they return there again, laying their Hou&s;es and Husbandry, VVives and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arabians, <HI>and their manner of Living.</HI></NOTE> Children, upon their Camels, like as the antient <HI>Nomades,</HI> and the <HI>Tartar Hordes,</HI> at this day, and go altogether in a Company, by <HI>Cabilles</HI> or Gene|rations; &s;o that if any one comes to &s;trike one of their Generation, they think them&s;elves all thereby injured, and pre&s;ently Revenge it. There are &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Cabilles</HI> who joyn them&s;elves together to make VVar upon other <HI>Cabilles</HI> that are not their Friends: There are &s;ometimes above Twelve thou&s;and of a <HI>Cabille</HI> or Parentage: For they Marry one ano|ther like Cou&s;ins, and thus con&s;erve the Memory of them&s;elves. The mo&s;t Ancient, and VVi&s;e&s;t among&s;t them, they make Chief, and Obey him in all Things, and every where, as their own Father, with a wonder|ful
<PB N="146" REF="129">
Re&s;pect, as I have &s;een in their <HI>Alcayde-Abda&s;&s;is,</HI> Captain of one of the&s;e <HI>Cabilles,</HI> which conducted us from <HI>Morocco</HI> to <HI>Saffy,</HI> to hinder tho&s;e of his <HI>Cabille</HI> from doing us any pre|judice, for he had taken us in his Cu&s;tody upon his Head, having &s;o promi&s;ed it to the King of <HI>Morocco;</HI> fora&s;much as his People held a good part of the way betwixt <HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Saffy.</HI></P>
<P>But to return to our Voyage; the morning being come, we rai&s;ed the Tents, and in waiting till the Camels were Laded, the <HI>Cavaliers, Moors</HI> and <HI>Arabians</HI> exerci&s;ed them&s;elves at the Lance: And there was, among&s;t o|thers, a young <HI>Alcayde,</HI> who took his Cour&s;e with his Lance again&s;t me, crying out to me in his Language, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Senari <HI>Chri&s;tian.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bara, bara, aben &s;enari,</HI> which is to &s;ay, Guard thy &s;elf, thou Son of a Chri|&s;tian&punc; I &s;purr'd then my Hor&s;e, which was a <HI>Barbe,</HI> very nimble, having two Pi&s;tols at my Saddle-bow, I ran at the Re-incountre with this <HI>Cavalier;</HI> but my Hor&s;e being &s;trong in the Mouth, was very near Precipitating me to the bottom of the&s;e <HI>Matamores,</HI> or Pits of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mata|mores.</NOTE>
<PB N="147" REF="129">
Water, which I have &s;poken of; for the Mouth of them are hid among&s;t the Gra&s;s, and they are there in great numbers: But &s;eeing my &s;elf almo&s;t upon the brink, and my Hor&s;e going to leap to the other &s;ide (which he could never have done without loo&s;ing us both:) I reined him &s;o to the pur|po&s;e, that if the <HI>Alcayde,</HI> which exer|ci&s;ed with me, had&punc; not al&s;o &s;topped, &s;eeing me &s;o near this Precipice, I had infallibly tumbled therein, but never come out again entirely; con&s;idering their great and horrible Depth.</P>
<P>When I &s;aw my &s;elf delivered from this danger, I prai&s;ed God, and re|tired as far as I could from thence, leaving the&s;e <HI>Moors</HI> to exerci&s;e by them&s;elves, not knowing &s;o well as they, where the&s;e <HI>Matamores</HI> are, &s;o dangerous to tho&s;e who are not aware of them.</P>
<P>After that we Travelled all the re&s;t of this Day, and endured extream Heats until toward Evening, then we pitched our Tents along by &s;ome Wa|ter, where all the&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> ca&s;t them|&s;elves to wa&s;h, and refre&s;h 'em, at which I was not a little vexed, for
<PB N="148" REF="130">
I had a great mind to drink of this Water, all muddy and dirty as it was, and be&s;ides a little falti&s;h, yet I was forced to Drink thereof. We pitched then in the&s;e De&s;arts, and the next <NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;arts without Waters.</NOTE> day, early in the Morning we depart|ed, Travelling all the Day in the Heat of the <HI>Sun,</HI> the greate&s;t that can be po&s;&s;ibly imagined, in the&s;e Fields Scorched and Burnt, becau&s;e of the Hot Winds which blew after &s;uch a manner, that we were ready to Die with Thir&s;t<HI>:</HI> At la&s;t, we came into a De&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rt, where we were forced to look for Water a far off. There was there the <HI>Adouars</HI> of the <HI>Arabians,</HI> who <NOTE PLACE="marg">Adouars.</NOTE> helped us to &s;ome Refre&s;hments of water and Camels Milk, which is not very &s;weet, but of a &s;trange ta&s;t to tho&s;e who are not accu&s;tomed to it; but nece&s;&s;ity makes every thing to &s;eem Good, as I have often experienced in all my Voyages.</P>
<P>The next morning going on our way, we perceived &s;everal <HI>Arabs</HI> with their Camels laden with Corn, who came to joyn with us, to go to <HI>Mo|rocco.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="130">
We met al&s;o great Numbers of <HI>Arabians</HI> on Hor&s;e-back with their Launces, who came about us to &s;alute their chief <HI>Abda&s;&s;is,</HI> and others of their kindred who were in our Company; I &s;aw them come with great Humili|ty to ki&s;s the Hands of their General <HI>Abda&s;&s;is</HI> who had Govern'd them a long time.</P>
<P>I went always in their Company, leaving the other Troops behind, for the de&s;ire I had, by following them, to get &s;ome Water of the <HI>Arabs</HI> their Friends, whom we found encamped in a Valley of the De&s;arts; for we went continually with &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a Heat, that I dur&s;t not &s;o much as lift&punc; up my Eyes&punc; Going thus, we met at the bottom of a Mountain &s;ome <HI>Arabian</HI> Shepherds, who kept Flocks of Sheep, Goats, and Cam|els: We went with a number of Cavalliers towards them, to know where we might find &s;ome Water, but they would not &s;hew us: Here|upon one of the&s;e <HI>Arabs,</HI> who came a long with us&punc; commanded one of the&s;e Shephards to give him his Stick; and having it in his Hands, began to
<PB N="150" REF="131">
beat the&s;e poor Wretches with &s;uch <NOTE PLACE="marg">Water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> fury, that I was very &s;orry to &s;ee it, although I was al&s;o very Thir&s;ty. This Savage Treatment made the Shepherds &s;hew us where their <HI>A|douars</HI> were, about a League from thence; where we went with all diligence, and found there one of the&s;e <HI>Arabs,</HI> who came to fetch Water far from thence, in a Goat-Skin. This Water was very Salt and hot; yet every one of the&s;e Cavalliers ca&s;t them&s;elves thereupon, for it was very little for &s;o many Men. I obliged them &s;o, with Money, that I obtained &s;ome of one of the&s;e <HI>Arabs</HI> where we were come. Truly it &s;eemed, that they bereaved the&s;e poor&punc; Wretches of their Lives in taking away their Water they come to look for &s;o far, and be&s;ides there is but little to be found, the Weather being &s;o exce&s;|&s;ive hot; for all their <HI>Matamores</HI> were dried up at that time.</P>
<P>Having a little refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we went to rejoyn the Camp of the <HI>Almahalle,</HI> and pitched our Tents near the River <HI>Ten&s;if,</HI> a little days Journey from <HI>Morocco.</HI> We met a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ten&s;if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">iver.</NOTE>

many <HI>Arabians</HI> all on Hor&s;eback, with their Launces, who came about us, to Salute their General <HI>Abda&s;&s;is,</HI> and others of their Friends, who were in our Company.</P>
<P>I &s;aw them again come with great Humility to Ki&s;s the Hands of this their Chief, <HI>Abda&s;&s;is,</HI> as before. There we quenched our Thir&s;t a little with this Water; though it was very hot. All the Land in the&s;e Countries is various, &s;ome part good, and others bad, but for the mo&s;t part Inculti|vated, except that which is near &s;ome Water, which they Till. This River <HI>Ten&s;if</HI> Breeds the mo&s;t excellent Trouts of any in the World, being very little, and their Fle&s;h red, but of an excellent Ta&s;te, and are mighti|ly e&s;teemed at <HI>Morocco.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning, going a little <NOTE PLACE="marg">Morocco.</NOTE> further, we di&s;covered <HI>Morocco,</HI> in a great Campagne; and this City &s;eems to be &s;ituated near to Mount <NOTE PLACE="marg">Atlas <HI>Mountain.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Atlas,</HI> though it is above 7 Leagues di&s;tant: VVe found by the way &s;ome Chri&s;tians, who came about us.</P>

The&s;e are People that Traffick there, and when they hear that any other Chri&s;tians come with the <HI>Ca&s;ile,</HI> they are very glad, and meet them by the way: They bring with them a little Mule laden with Victuals. Now the mo&s;t part of the Chri&s;tians of this <HI>Ca&s;ile</HI> were Engli&s;h, Pri&s;oners, with Irons upon their Feet, and had been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Engli&s;h Pri&s;oners at</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> Arre&s;ted at <HI>Saffy,</HI> upon the account of an <HI>Alcayde</HI> named <HI>Abdelacinthe,</HI> who was a Portugue&s;e by&punc; Nation, but a Renegado&punc; And for his Capacity and VVorth, he had given him the Com|mand of the <HI>Ca&s;ile</HI> who returned from <HI>Morocco</HI> to <HI>Saffy,</HI> with about 500 Soldiers under his Charge.</P>

As &s;oon as they heard this, pre&s;ently the People of Boat (who were hid in the Bu&s;hes) came to &s;eize upon his Per&s;on, and took him, and carried him away in their Ve&s;&s;el, by which means he &s;aved him&s;elf. The Slave fled to the <HI>Almahalle,</HI> to give them notice of the taking of his Ma&s;ter, at which they were mightily a&s;toni&s;hed, and pre&s;ently retired to <HI>Saffy:</HI> But as the People of an Engli&s;h Boat at the &s;ame time were come on Shore for &s;ome things they had then occa&s;ion for, they were Arre&s;ted, and had Irons

<P>The 23th of the &s;ame month we went to pitch the <HI>Almahalle</HI> clo&s;e by Mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> in a level ground, in which place I went to look for &s;ome Plants and Herbs, and as I returned again into the Camp, the <HI>Alcayde Ab|da&s;&s;is,</HI> Captain of a Cabille of <HI>Arabians,</HI> perceived me, and called me to him, asking me what Herbs the&s;e were that I carried, and what I intended to do with them; after I had &s;atisfied his Demands, I withdrew into our Tent: About 4 or 5 a clock in the evening, going out to walk and to take the fre&s;h Air, I met again with the <HI>Alcayde,</HI> who was al&s;o walking about to vi&s;it his Camp; and having called me, took me by the Hand, and led me without the Camp, giving me account of &s;e|veral things of the Wars of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hi&s;tory of the Battle</HI> of <HI>Don</HI> Se|ba&s;tian <HI>of</HI> Portugal.</NOTE> concerning the Battle of Don <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> at which time he was a young Man, it being 35 years &s;ince: He told me among&s;t other things, how the Chri&s;tians at that time

<P>After this Di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Alcayde,</HI> we withdrew our &s;elves into our Tents until the next morning that we began again to take Journey, and had that day very bad way by &s;teep and inac|ce&s;&s;ible Mountains, not being able to keep any Order for the in&s;upportable Heat; as for fre&s;h Water we had none. I was mounted upon a Mule, and was forced frequently to get down to beat it away on foot, which was no &s;mall trouble for me, in that I had near 6000 Crowns about me, as well in Lignots, as in Tybre, that is Powder, as it comes from <HI>Gago,</HI> and al&s;o in Money, which are Sequins of the Country: I had a great deal of trouble to remount; for it did not behove me to &s;tay behind, for fear of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and of tho&s;e of our Caravan them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed all the hard&s;hips of this Journey, we came to pitch at the

from their Hands: Their de|&s;ign was, (as I believe) to make me quit the Gold and Silver which I car|ried, and then to cut my Throat, and to ca&s;t me in &s;ome Ditch: But I had a good In&s;piration when I was ju&s;t up|on the point of de&s;cending; and as my good Angel would have it, the great Road, through which the Cara|van pa&s;&s;ed was not far from thence, which did facilitate my &s;afety&punc; My too much Diligence, and the great de&s;ire that I had to advance to get to <HI>Saffy</HI> the fir&s;t, had been the cau&s;e of this Accident.

<P>This change of Affairs at <HI>Morocco</HI> happened after my departure from the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Revoluti|ons at</HI> Morocco.</NOTE> City: For <HI>Muley-Boufairs</HI> King of <HI>Morocco,</HI> having lo&s;t the Battle again&s;t his Nephew <HI>Abdalla,</HI> fled away into the Mountains, where he was Robb'd, as I have &s;aid, and <HI>Abdalla</HI> was then in peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Morocco;</HI> But during the Peace, <HI>Abdalla</HI> having di&s;covered that the other hatched &s;ome Trea&s;on to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s him, he Stabb'd him with his own Hands, after having

<P>As for the <HI>Marabous</HI> or <HI>Santons,</HI> they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Santons <HI>dangerous.</HI></NOTE> are very dangerous among&s;t the&s;e Peo|ple, by rea&s;on that the pretext of De|votion and Sanctity of their Law, as in all others, is a great means to Com|motions again&s;t the State, as it is often &s;een, and of fre&s;h memory in him, who within this 100 years hath founded this la&s;t Family, which does Rule there at this day.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Muley-Chec,</HI> who was at <HI>Mo|rocco,</HI> he went into <HI>Spain,</HI> out of a de|&s;ire

to become Chri&s;tian, and indeed he delivered the &s;trong place of <HI>Ara|che</HI> into the hands of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> who for this gave him a Pen&s;ion, and promi&s;ed to re&s;tore him, with an Army, to the Kingdoms of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco:</HI> But tho&s;e of <HI>Fez</HI> would not hearken to that, not agreeing with the Spani|ards; And <HI>Abdalla</HI> his Son returned to <HI>Fez,</HI> who al&s;o hindered him, in&s;omuch, that the <HI>Chec</HI> has been &s;ince con&s;train'd to go back again of his own accord, without gaining any thing of the Spa|niards &s;ave the lo&s;s of putting &s;uch a place into their Hands.</P>
<P>But to return to the Abode that I was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sa&s;&s;y <HI>and its De&s;|cription.</HI></NOTE> forced to make at <HI>Sa&s;&s;y,</HI> I employed my &s;elf in the mean time in viewing this City, and the Parts there abouts<HI>:</HI> 'Tis a little City &s;ituated upon the brink of the Sea, which has no convenient Ha|ven but only a Road, and flat Shore, and has formerly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Portugals: It may be as big as <HI>Cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">eil,</HI> and very well Walled, being in habited by all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ts of People, as Jews, Moors, and Chri&s;tians, and hath a <HI>Douane.</HI></P>

<P>I will add to this, that all the Moors are nothing el&s;e but Captives &amp; Slaves <NOTE PLACE="marg">Moors Slaves to their King.</NOTE> of their King; for they dare not &s;o much as &s;tir out of the Country and Kingdom, without his expre&s;s Licence and Command, as I have taken notice of &s;everal times at <HI>Saffy.</HI> I remember one day, a young Man, a Moor, having by chance ca&s;t him&s;elf into a Boat of the Chri&s;tians, out of curio&s;ity, or to

<P>Being entered into the Channel, we de&s;cried a Ship, making full &s;ail upon us, and believing that it was a Flem|ing, we prepared our &s;elves to receive her, but the night coming on, which was very Stormy, we lo&s;t her, bear|ing more to the N.E.

for tho&s;e of the Gallion knew nothing of the Death of the Count <HI>de la Fera,</HI> nor of the di&s;per&s;ing of the Fleet, they being &s;eparated from us hard by the I&s;le of <HI>Madera:</HI> We weighed Anchor from thence, not finding above 5 or 6 Fathoms Water.

<P>This being thus over, the next day in the evening, the Captain &s;ent one of his Men to take off my Irons, who left me Pri&s;oner below Deck, with 6 Soldiers to guard me, who followed me every where for fear that I &s;hould leap into the Sea to &s;ave my &s;elf.</P>

When I &s;aw my &s;elf a little more at liberty, I a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Secretary <HI>John Bapti&s;to,</HI> with a little Bi&s;cuit cut into little Bits, being black, rotten, and mouldy, and much ado to get that: I rai&s;ed up, as well as I could, the cover of the place where I was enclo&s;ed, and thus gave him &s;ome little Bits, which was no &s;mall help to him.</P>
<P>But as God never for&s;akes his Ser|vants in their Afflictions, the &s;aid <HI>John Bapti&s;to</HI> told me in Latin, that he had found means to open the Pad-Locks of his Irons, and to take them of; and had al&s;o met with a Pipe of Wine, but could not get any of it without a hollow piece of Tinn, which he would u&s;e, putting a Stick through it with &s;ome Tow or Flax at the end, like a Sponge, and thus to draw out the Wine: I di&s;covered this Bu&s;ine&s;s to the <HI>Merigne,</HI> who kept us Pri&s;oners, and who was very well &s;atisfied to have his part thereof, and not to &s;ay a word, getting me a Burrage of Lea|ther, which I gave to the &s;aid <HI>Bapti&s;to</HI> at night, when the Soldiers were bu&s;ie at their &s;ports above us, and be|fore the Lamp was lighted<HI>:</HI> This

<P>About 5 days after, when Don <HI>Louis d' Alves</HI> was gone, <HI>John Bapti&s;to</HI> was taken out from under the Hatches, and was left under the Deck with me, but not without Irons fa&s;tned on his Feet, when, as for me, I had no longer either Collars or Irons: Now one day as I was walking backwards and forwards upon the Deck, I by good fortune found under a Cannon, a Stone Bottle full of Syrop of Gilli-flowers; this I communicated to the <HI>Meregne,</HI> who took and kept it up for us both: I made u&s;e of this Syrop very often, as well to drink as to &s;op a little Bi&s;|cuit therein, and in a little time I perceived my Gumbs to grow better, and my Legs began to &s;tretch, which was no &s;mall comfort to me; in &s;hort, I was quite cured of my Di&s;ea&s;e, al&s;o making u&s;e of &s;ome Remedies which I took out of a Che&s;t full of Medecines which I found one day below Deck quite open.</P>

<P>After that I pa&s;&s;ed by a Pagod or Temple, very well built, and entering therein I found one of the Natives &s;tark-naked, adorning their Idol with Flowers, which had a Head like a

<P>As for the Pay-gods, they have &s;eve|ral <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paygods.</NOTE> &s;orts of them; Some for War, others for Peace, and for Love, where the Maids coming to be Married, are brought to be De&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">oured; and their Idol hath the Privy Parts like a Man. The Dam&s;els, who &s;erve the&s;e Pay|gods like the Ve&s;tal-Virgins, continue there from 10 to 20 years of Age, and Dance all night long, carrying lighted Lamps in their Hands, and go to Sleep round about their Idols. I &s;aw there very beautiful Girls and Women They Marry their Daughters at 8 or 9 years of Age; when they are once pa&s;t 12 or 13, they are not regarded, becau&s;e they believe them to continue no longer Maids, con&s;idering the heat of the Country: At the end of 20 years, the&s;e Religious Women that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indian <HI>Women Re|ligious.</HI></NOTE> have thus &s;erved the Pay-gods, are kept in a certain place the re&s;t of their Lives.</P>
<P>After I had gathered &s;ome Herbs which I had occa&s;ion for, we went to
<PB N="241" REF="184">
a little Habitation of Gentiles, where I demanded by my <HI>Truch-man,</HI> if they had any Victuals to give us for our Money, for there is no Inns or Taverns there; but there were &s;ome little Shops where they &s;old Fruit, and other things fit to Eat: The&s;e Gentiles ha|ving Compa&s;&s;ion on me, there was a Woman, who put me under a Gallery of her Hou&s;e, where there was a Nap|kin full of Leaves and Plantane, ac|commodated with Thorns; then &s;he threw me &s;ome Rice thereupon, with a certain Sauce which they call <HI>Caril,</HI> I Eat all this, and when I was about to Drink out of a little Ve&s;&s;el of Copper that they had given me full of Water, they began to cry out upon me, becau&s;e I touched it in Drinking, for they never touch the Cup in Drink|ing, only heaving it up with the Server whereon it &s;tands, and &s;o Drink.</P>
<P>The Floor and Pavement of their Hou&s;es are compo&s;ed with Cow-Dung, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ants trou|ble&s;ome.</NOTE> which they make look exceeding bright, and think that it keeps away the Ants, which are there in abun|dance; and they can keep nothing free from being de&s;troy'd by the&s;e lit|tle
<PB REF="185">
Animals, to prevent which they have al&s;o Cupboards bore upon Piles, &s;et in Ve&s;&s;els full of Water, where the Ants drown them&s;elves by thinking to mount up. Near to this Habitation I found a great Tree, laden with <HI>Ta|marins,</HI> of which I gathered a few: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tamarins.</NOTE> They had yet nothing but a &s;ower Ta&s;te, I carried away the Husk, which are almo&s;t like French-Beans, but lar|ger and greater.</P>
<P>Now as I returned by a very De|&s;art Place, I &s;aw &s;ome of the&s;e Gentiles running in great ha&s;te; and having cau&s;ed my Truch-man to ask what ailed them, they an&s;wered, that their Fa|ther was gone to Drown him&s;elf, a little after I &s;aw them return, bringing back their Father, and Comforting him after the be&s;t manner they could: He was troubled for &s;ome Misfortune that had happened to him. It is a common thing with the&s;e People to Drown or Poi&s;on them&s;elves, or to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Indians <HI>&s;ubject to Di&s;pair.</HI></NOTE> Die after &s;ome &s;uch way, when any Accident happens to them.</P>
<P>As for the Women, 'tis the Cu&s;tom, that when the Body of their Dead Husbands are Burnt, they ca&s;t them|&s;elves
<PB N="242" REF="185">
into the Funeral Pile, and Burn <NOTE PLACE="marg">Women who burn them|&s;elves.</NOTE> them&s;elves, after being fir&s;t adorned with their riche&s;t Accoutrements and Jewels, Dancing at the Sound of In|&s;truments, and thus Die with a won|derful Con&s;tancy, &s;peaking in the Fire to the very la&s;t: Tho&s;e who do not this are held Infamous &s;o long as they live, not daring to &s;hew them&s;elves before others, nor to appear before their Friends and Kindred. Such as have a weaker Courage Poi&s;on them|&s;elves, &s;eeing their Husband Dead, and are Burnt together with him.</P>
<P>Tis remarkable that the Body of the Woman hath &s;uch an Oyley Pro|perty, that one Body will &s;erve like Oil or Gree&s;e to con&s;ume the Bodies of 5 or 6 men. The Moors and Maho|metans who inhabit the Main-Land of <HI>Goa</HI> towards <HI>Pichelin,</HI> do not allow this &s;ort of Cruelty in the Women; but when they &s;ee they cannot obtain this favour, they Poi&s;on them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom of Burning them&s;elves hath continued, as they &s;ay, ever &s;ince a certain Gentile King, who reigned a|mong&s;t them; who &s;eeing how all the Men of his Kingdom died, and know|ing
<PB REF="186">
that it was their Wives which Poi&s;oned them, to have other Hus|bands; and that tho&s;e who had Chil|dren &s;hould continue alive to take care of them, but without Power ever to Marry again, in&s;tituted this: They ob|&s;erve this very &s;trictly, and do nothing but Groan, Weep and Lament, during the re&s;t of their Life; and at certain hours of the day and night, howl and lament after &s;o &s;trange a manner, that 'tis a great pity to hear them.</P>
<P>As for my part I was &s;ometimes Deafened with the clamours and noi&s;e of &s;ome or other who had lo&s;t Husband or Children&punc; I have heard a <HI>Bramin</HI> &s;ay, (who had turned Chri&s;tian) that they who have lo&s;t a Child, mourn and lament 20 years entire: He told me al&s;o, that a certain Woman&punc; of tho&s;e who us'd to &s;erve the Pay-gods, that after being retired into a Hou&s;e where they pa&s;s their time with Men, &s;he entertained one who heated him&s;elf &s;o with her, that he Died upon the &s;pot, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;olution of a Lover.</NOTE> at which &s;he was &s;o afflicted, that when they Burnt his Body, &s;he Burnt her &s;elf with him, &s;eeing he had Died for Love of her, tho' &s;he was no other than a good Friend.</P>

<P>We departed in a very fine evening, and travelled all night, the Moon &s;hining, in&s;omuch that we arrived at <HI>Pichelin,</HI> a very plea&s;ant City, where is a great number of Gentile Merchants, and belongs to <HI>Dealcan,</HI> it being &s;ome 4 Leagues from <HI>Goa:</HI> We went to the Lodging of one <HI>Manate,&punc;</HI> a Gentile, who received us kindly upon the Acquain|tance he had with our Truch-man, and put me to lie under a little Pent-Hou&s;e, where an Indian Woman brought her Daughter to lie with me, as this <HI>Manate</HI> had coun&s;elled her; but this Girl not above 13 years of Age, &s;eeing I would not touch her, &s;ell to Weeping and Groaning, thinking to

A Portugal Gentleman related to me how he had been thus Robb'd by that &s;ort of People, as he was going to Sup|per; For his Slave having opened the Door upon their telling him they had a word or two to &s;ay to his Ma&s;ter, en|tering in by force, and leaving one at the Door, took at the fir&s;t bout all the Plate which was upon the Table, de|manding of him 200 Cheraphins if he had a mind to have them again, which he gave them, and &s;o they went away. If the Ju&s;tice goes to take them, they have great Bags of Cannon-Powder, with Matches tied about them, threat|ning to throw them among&s;t tho&s;e who offer to approach the Door.</P>
<P>The Portugals are grown &s;o extream jealous of their Wives that you mu&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jealou&s;ie of the</HI> Portu|gals.</NOTE> not &s;o much as look them in the Face; and if they &s;ee them but &s;peak to any one, they pre&s;ently Strangle or Poi&s;on them; and when they have Strangled them, they call their Neighbours to their Succour, &s;aying, that a Swooning Fit has taken their Wife upon the Chair; But they never come again to them&s;elves: Sometimes they &s;end for a Barber to Blood them, &s;aying, that they are not well; When the Barber is
<PB N="250" REF="193">
gone away, they undo the Fillet, and let he Blood run out until the poor mi&s;e|rable Creature dies; and then al&s;o they call in the Neighbours, to &s;ee as they &s;ay, what a &s;ad Di&s;a&s;ter has happened to their Wife in Sleeping.</P>
<P>Others there are who take their Wives with them to Bath in &s;ome Brook or Pond, and there make them Drink their Belly full; and a little while after, &s;end their Slaves to look for their Mi&s;tre&s;s, whom they find Drown'd, which the Husband knowing before, &s;eems to be&punc; mightily a&s;toni&s;hed and grieved at.</P>
<P>Thus in different ways, they make away their Wives, on the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion, and afterwards relate the Story among&s;t one another<HI>:</HI> There are &s;ome who have thus made away 3 or 4 Wives.</P>
<P>But the Women al&s;o, when they think their Husbands entertain any other, rid them&s;elves of them by Poi&s;on, or other|ways, and make much u&s;e of the Seeds of <HI>Datura,</HI> which has a &s;trange Virtue; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Datura <HI>Poi&s;on.</HI></NOTE> This <HI>Datura,</HI> or <HI>Dutroa,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>Stra|monium,</HI> is a great and high Plant, bear|ing white Flowers, like the <HI>Ci&s;ampelos,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ci&s;ampe|los.</NOTE> but larger.

<P>As for the Slaves, 'tis pity to &s;ee the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruel Cha|&s;ti&s;ement to the Slaves.</NOTE> cruel Cha&s;ti&s;ements they give them&punc; For they run them through with dou|ble Irons, then give them with a Cud|gel, 500 blows at a time, and make them lie along the ground on their Bel|ly, and then comes two, who by turns &s;trike the poor Body as a Log of Wood, the Ma&s;ter Portugal or <HI>Metice</HI> being pre&s;ent, counts the Blows with his <HI>Ro&s;aire:</HI> And if by chance they who thus &s;trike are not &s;trong enough to his mind, or have an inclination to &s;pare their Companion, he cau&s;es them to be

<P>As I was in my Lodging at <HI>Goa,</HI> I heard nothing but Blows all the night long, and &s;ome weak Voice, which Breathed a little, for they &s;top their Mouth with a Linnen Cloth, to hinder them from crying out. After they have been well beaten, they cau&s;e their Bodies to be &s;liced with a Razor, then rub it with Salt and Vinegar for fear it &s;hould Fe&s;ter.</P>
<P>They have another &s;ort of puni&s;h|ment which they call <HI>Pingar Viue,</HI> which <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cruelty of the</HI> Portu|gals.</NOTE> is to drop Lard put into a red hot <HI>Pelle,</HI> upon the Body of the poor Patient, &s;tark naked and lying upon his Belly.

<P>I have &s;ometimes &s;een part of the&s;e Barbarous Cruelties which afflicted me &s;o much, that I have &s;till a horrour when I think thereof. There was one day a poor Indian Girl, who came run|ning to my Lodging, crying out for help, and praying me to be a means to obtain Mercy; but I could not &s;ave her, to my great Sorrow; For &s;he was

<P>There was a <HI>Metice</HI> Woman who had by the&s;e horrible Cha&s;ti&s;ements killed 5 or 6 Slaves, which &s;he cau&s;ed to be Buried in her Garden; And one day as &s;he ordered another to be thus puni&s;hed, he who gave her the Blows going to leave off, the mi&s;erable Crea|ture in the mean time Died; and when <NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span">, i.e. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ive it her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ive it her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> an old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">x.</HI></NOTE> he told his Mi&s;tri&s;s that &s;he was Dead; no, no, &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he counterfeits, <HI>Daly Dalyes, Rapo&s;e Veille,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>Lay on, lay on, 'tis an old Fox.</HI></P>

this horrible Famine, the People of the Kingdoms round about being ad|verti&s;ed of this extream nece&s;&s;ity, equip|ped a quantity of Ve&s;&s;els laden with Rice, and other Victuals, which they brought to <HI>Pegu,</HI> and &s;old it there for what they plea&s;ed: Among&s;t the re&s;t, there was a Merchant of <HI>Goa,</HI> who arriving there with a Boat laden with Rice, as he went <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sad History of a</HI> Pegu|an <HI>Dam&s;el.</HI></NOTE> from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e to put off his Mer|chandize, taking for payment, Money, Slaves, or other things they could give him: He happened upon a Hou&s;e where they had not wherewithall to Buy &s;o much as a Mea&s;ure of Rice, and yet ready to Die with Rage and Hunger, but they &s;hewed this Merchant an ex|ceeding Beautiful Woman, whom her Brethren and Si&s;ters had a mind to &s;ell for a Slave for certain Mea&s;ures of Rice; the Merchant offered 2 Mea&s;ures, or Bu&s;hels, and they would have 3, Re|mon&s;trating, that if they killed this Girl, the Fle&s;h would la&s;t them and nouri&s;h them much longer than his Rice; At la&s;t, when they could not a|gree, the Merchant went his way, but no &s;ooner was he gone, than they killed this young Woman, and cut her to pie|ces: But the Merchant being not a lit|tle

<P>Now to return to tho&s;e of <HI>Siam,</HI> the cau&s;e why the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;o barba|rou&s;ly u&s;es the Portugals, is, that they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">lties of the</HI> Por|tugals&punc;</NOTE> u&s;e the &s;ame Treatment towards his Captive Subjects.

<P>The Portugals acquire much Repu|tation of making good Chri&s;tians; for having cau&s;ed them to be Baptized, they thus make them Die mi&s;erably: Al&s;o the <HI>Japans</HI> knowing their Letchery and in&s;atiable Avarice, &s;eem to have had &s;ome rea&s;on for their ri&s;ing again&s;t them: For the&s;e, who are a &s;ubtile and wary Peo|ple, &s;eeing that the de&s;ign of the Portu|gals,

<P>I have found out in the <HI>Indies,</HI> that the Whoredoms, Ambition, Avarice, and Greedine&s;s of the Portugals, has been one of the chiefe&s;t cau&s;es why the <HI>Indians</HI> become not Chri&s;tians &s;o ea&s;ily: This is the Rea&s;on why the People of the Portugal Churches, who are in tho&s;e parts, mightily de&s;ire &s;ome French, Dutch, or Scots to be with them, be|cau&s;e the&s;e People lead a life le&s;s impure and &s;candalous; which is the thing that mo&s;t chiefly maintains and upholds Religion in that part of the World.

<P>But to return to <HI>Goa,</HI> I think it not much ami&s;s to relate what a Portugal Gentleman told me of their Adventures, which was that once going to War towards the South Sea, with the Naval Army of Ga|liots, (which every year go out again&s;t the <HI>Malabars)</HI> about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> when their Winter is pa&s;t, and at the &s;ame time another Army goes out to the North Sea, which is towards the Red Sea.</P>
<P>The Captains of the Army held Coun|cil together to go into a Habitation of the Gentiles, along by the Coa&s;t near to <HI>Co|chin,</HI> to take away by force a Golden Pagod, very great, with other little ones, who were in a certain Temple there: But fora&s;much as the&s;e Gentiles were Confe|derates with the Portugals, they would not do this enterpri&s;e in the day-time, but went one night to go a&s;hore in this little City, not far from the Sea, where the Pagod was, and &s;etting foot on Land, they &s;et Fire in every place to fright the&s;e poor People, and &s;o went &s;traight to the Pagod, but the Fire pa&s;&s;ed &s;o quickly, that before they had Power to take the Idol it forced
<PB REF="210">
them to retire a little fa&s;ter than they came, and had no more time than only to &s;natch the Pendants and Rings from the Ears and Fingers of the&s;e poor Reli|gious Women, who were &s;hut up, Dan|cing all the night in their Pagod, according to their Cu&s;tom: They were near 500, and &s;eeing the Enemy entering, they all a&s;&s;embled them&s;elves together, fa&s;tening their Legs and Arms one within another, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for the Portugals to draw &s;o much as one of them out: But &s;eeing the Fire at their Heels, they only &s;natched away the Jewels from their Ears, their Fingers they cruelly cut off to have the Rings, and they made &s;uch a lamen|table noi&s;e, that 'twas a great pity to hear them: The Portugals flying away from the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, left all the&s;e Religious young Women to be Burnt, none being able to &s;uccour them; and thus cruelly do the Portugals treat their be&s;t Friends and Confederates: He who related to me this pitious Hi&s;tory, was named Don <HI>Louts Lobe,</HI> who was of this enterpri&s;e, and told me, that this uproar moved him from his very Heart to Pity.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the City of <HI>Goa,</HI> and the Country round about, I pretend not here to make an exact and ample Di&s;cription; yet I de&s;ire the Reader to

take notice, that that little which I &s;peak is no more than what my Memory was able to furni&s;h me withall; for being up|on the places, I was &s;o carefully watched, as are all Strangers, and e&s;pecially the French, that I could put nothing in Wri|ting; And this was the principal cau&s;e of my Impri&s;onment at <HI>Mo&s;ambique,</HI> being accu&s;ed of having made a Ruttier of the Sea, which thing the Portugals fear the mo&s;t, not being willing, that the French, Engli&s;h, or Hollanders, &s;hould know any thing of tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>I will &s;ay of <HI>Goa</HI> in a few words, that it is a City excellent well &s;cituated in an I&s;land, environed with the River, &s;ome part level, and other mountainous, and may be about as big as <HI>Tours,</HI> but Peopled with all Nations of <HI>India:</HI> It is very well built, in its Churches, Ho&s;pitals, Colleges, publick Palaces, and particular Hou&s;es of the Portugals and Natives, which are of a reddi&s;h Ba&s;tard Marble, and Free-Stone: The other Hou&s;es of the Indians are like Cabins built with Earth, and &s;ome Stone: They have a great number of Gardens, with <HI>Tanques,</HI> or great Ponds to Bath in, and many Fruit&punc; Trees<HI>:</HI> The Country is good and fertile, bearing Rice twice a year: The Gentiles have liberty of their Religion, but are not &s;uffered to have any

Pagod or Temple within the City, but on|ly in the main-land, and out of the I&s;le.</P>
<P>When the&s;e Gentiles and Idolaters come to Die, if they leave little Children, the Je&s;uits are careful to take and bring them up, and in&s;truct them in the Faith; and therefore for their Pains, they &s;eize upon their Lands, Inheritances, and Goods&punc; My Ho&s;t, a Chri&s;tian Indian, told me, that he had been &s;erved after this manner, without being a jot the better in&s;tructed.</P>
<P>As for the Men of War, they are about 1500 or 2000, according as the Fleets arrive.

I neither knew nor met with any Frenchman there, but a good Father Je&s;uit, named <HI>E&s;tienne de la Croix,</HI> Native of <HI>Roan,</HI> of whom I re|ceived no &s;mall kindne&s;s: I al&s;o &s;aw 3 others, who had e&s;caped from the <HI>Mal|dives,</HI> among&s;t whom was one named <HI>Francois Pirard,</HI> a Briton, who has Writ the Hi&s;tory of his Voyages: I was told that 3 Months before I arrived at <HI>Goa,</HI> there went away from thence, a French Gentleman named <HI>de Feynes,</HI> ho cau&s;ed

him&s;elf to be called the Count of <HI>Mon&s;ert:</HI> He was mighty skillful in the Art of Blowing up places; which was the cau&s;e of his Misfortune; for coming from <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Ormus,</HI> as he was di&s;cour&s;ing there&punc; that he knew the way of Blowing up a Fortre&s;s, was it never &s;o &s;trong, he was pre&s;ently laid hold of as a Pri&s;oner, and carried to <HI>Goa,</HI> where he was kept in Pri|&s;on for fear he would ob&s;erve the For|tre&s;&s;es; and the fir&s;t Fleet that returned to <HI>Portugal,</HI> he was &s;ent therein, and kept Pri&s;oner at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> until Mon&s;ieur&punc; <HI>du Mayne</HI> went into <HI>Spain,</HI> who obtain'd his Deli|verance.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the Fertility of the Land of <HI>Goa,</HI> and what it produces, I remit you to what has been written by the Portugals; only I &s;ay, that the Fruit mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the life of Man, is that of the Palm. This Tree is Spongy, ha|ving little Strings or Veins environed with a Pellicule, and draws its &s;ub&s;tance from the Sandy-Earth, from which it al&s;o draws great abundance of moi&s;ture, which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the greatne&s;s of the Fruit it bears, and the quantity of <HI>E&s;ura</HI> or Wine which this Fruit renders. Of the Nut of this Palm-Tree, &s;o celebrated in the <HI>Indies,</HI> they draw abundance of Meat and Drink.</P>
<P>There a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> plenty of the&s;e Coco's, or

Maldives; but among&s;t others, they re|mark one &s;ort thereof which comes from the bottom of the Sea, the Fruit is bigger than the common Palm; 'tis al&s;o very dear among&s;t the Portugals, who &s;up|po&s;e it to have a great Virtue for the Di&s;|ea&s;e of the Lungs, and for the <HI>A&s;tmatiques,</HI> or Shortne&s;s of Breath, and again&s;t Poi|&s;on. The Nut thereof is very great, long and black, in form of a Gondale; The Tree that bears this Fruit is not to be &s;een, growing at the bottom of the Sea: but when the Sea is agitated, the Fruit is born from the bottom to the top, and is found upon the Shore.</P>

<P>The 15th of <HI>Feb.</HI> we &s;aw the I&s;le of <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> mightily covered with Fog, and bearing about to pa&s;s the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> with a favourable Gale of Wind, we pa&s;&s;ed it the 16th of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>Being at the height of the I&s;le of <HI>St. Helens,</HI> we were in great doubt whether we &s;hould go on Shore to take there &s;ome fre&s;h Water, and the Pa&s;&s;engers and Ma|riners di&s;puted &s;tifly again&s;t the Ma&s;ter and Pilot, but they put it all to the Sieur <HI>Andre Furtado,</HI> who was then mortally Sick, and who &s;aid that he had no Or|ders from the King of <HI>Spain</HI> to go to the &s;aid I&s;le, except it was in ca&s;e of great nece&s;&s;ity, and that he feared to find there &s;ome Enemies, who might give them trouble, it being the place where they

<P>Parting from this Place, we went along by a Rivolet to lodge upon a little Hill within the enclo&s;ure of cer|tain Walls very low, where there was a &s;mall Cottage of the <HI>Arabians:</HI> We lay along the Wall, and pa&s;&s;ed the Night with great fear of the thievi&s;h <HI>Arabs.</HI> We parted from thence be|times in the Morning, and came to <HI>Bailbec,</HI> a very ancient City, where <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bailbec.</NOTE> formerly lived Chri&s;tians, the Ruines of a Church remaining there yet. I went into the City with my <HI>Mouquary,</HI> which was the <HI>Turk,</HI> that furni&s;hed me with a Hor&s;e to ride upon, and there we &s;ought for a little Wine, but privately, it being forbid to &s;ell any: We found &s;ome White, very good, at the Hou&s;e of a <HI>Grecian,</HI> who earne&s;t|ly de&s;ired us to hide it. They failed not to come to &s;earch our Cloaths, and other things, but they could not find it, for we had locked it fa&s;t up.

<P>We di&s;lodged from this Place two or three Hours before Day, pa&s;&s;ing by Rocks, of which the mo&s;t part were <NOTE PLACE="marg">Aquaeducts.</NOTE> broke and thrown down, and the Veins and Pipes bigger than ones Arm are &s;till to be &s;een, through which flowed the Water before they were broke down: There is among&s;t others one of the&s;e Rocks &s;lit in two, about 3 or 4 Leagues from <HI>Dama&s;cus;</HI> and the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> which comes <NOTE PLACE="marg">Jordan.</NOTE> from Mount <HI>Lebanus,</HI> pa&s;&s;es with great &s;wiftne&s;s very near it, there is a Bridge over which we pa&s;&s;ed: Along by this River are places cut like Caves within the Rock, where lived formerly cer|tain Hermits; and truly the Place is very proper for a &s;olitary Life, being exceeding de&s;ert, and of difficult ac|ce&s;s.

<P>Now my <HI>Turk</HI> who &s;ought nothing more than to ea&s;e me of my Money, &s;tirred up two <HI>Arabians</HI> to demand <HI>Al|cafar</HI> of me, or Tribute.

<P>We had there great Rains, which we were forced to endure Day and and Night very patiently, without having any thing to &s;helter us<HI>:</HI> But &s;eeing it continued without cea&s;ing, I placed my &s;elf with the&s;e Three <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Brethren, not tru&s;ting my &s;elf any longer with my <HI>Turk,</HI> and fol|lowed them into the City, with my little Baggage, not knowing then where this my gallant <HI>Mouquary</HI> was.

<P>The Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Tripoly</HI> is a Man very Proud and Cruel; and I was told there, That once he being amorous of a very beautiful young Woman of one of the be&s;t Hou&s;es in the City, and &s;eeing that he could not bring his De&s;ires to pa&s;s by any &s;ort of Artifice, he re&s;olved to u&s;e Violence; and watching his opportunity when &s;he went to the Stoves with her Mother, as it was their Cu&s;tom; where pre|&s;ently going, he took this poor young <NOTE PLACE="marg">Barbarous Cruelty of a Ba&s;&s;a.</NOTE> Woman by force, and having-had his
<PB N="323" REF="42">
Will of her, he took his Gangear, or Knife, made in the form of a Croi|&s;ant, and ript her open quite from the Privy-Parts up to the Neck. Behold how the&s;e Barbarians give Satisfa|ction to their de&s;ires, how horrible and wicked &s;over they be!</P>
<P>I was al&s;o told how that this Ba&s;&s;a, at the Arrival of a certain <HI>French</HI> Ship, called the <HI>Dauphin,</HI> belonging to the Sieur <HI>de Moi&s;&s;et,</HI> had a mind to go on board her, where having been treated with all the Complai&s;ance ima|ginable, at his coming out from thence one of his Favourites reproached him for eating with the Chri&s;tians; at which he was in &s;uch a Fury, that he ca&s;t his Gangear at him, with which he &s;o wounded him, that had not the Surgeon immediately dre&s;&s;ed him, he had died thereof upon the Place. They relate &s;everal other cruel Acts and Violences of this Man, which are very ordinary and common to all the&s;e Race of Infidels.</P>

Queen-Regent, I failed not, &s;o &s;oon as I came to <HI>Paris,</HI> to go do my Re|verence to Their Maje&s;ties, who were very glad to &s;ee my Rarities, and com|manded that a fit Place &s;hould be given me in their Palace of the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cabinet in the</HI> Thuil|leries.</NOTE> there to frame a Cabinet of all &s;orts of Rarities, and other curious things which I had gathered together in all my Travels throughout the World. But after having &s;o well begun what I had at that time in hand, I judged that to pur&s;ue it according to my De|&s;ire, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for me to undertake &s;ome more Voyages, and I had no le&s;s de&s;ign than to encompa&s;s the whole World, fir&s;t by way of the Occident, and from thence by the O|rient to return again into our Occi|dent; an Enterprize, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;o great, that the only Pre&s;umption of &s;o much as ever having it in my Mind, I believe would have gained me Glory enough; and yet I hoped, that by the Grace of him who had al|ways conducted me every where, I &s;hould have been able to have brought it to pa&s;s.

<P><PB N="327" REF="44">

<P>From thence I returned to <HI>Seville,</HI> where the Sieur <HI>Juan Sanche,</HI> the A|pothecary, would have per&s;waded me to tarry with him; but I had my Voyage of the <HI>Indies</HI> &s;o in my Head, that I had no mind to tarry there, but took my way &s;treight to St. <HI>Luear,</HI> and &s;ailed along the River, with a great many other Per&s;ons for Company in a Boat.</P>
<P>We arrived in the Night-time at St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> and I went to lodge with my former Ho&s;t, who was called <HI>Ba|&s;tanuil Bi&s;cain.</HI> I continued there for &s;ome Days to wait for an Occa&s;ion to embark: But my bad Fortune would have it &s;o, that the Ve&s;&s;els which were then in the Port, dur&s;t not ven|ture out, becau&s;e they had Advice, that from <HI>Argier,</HI> and other Places of <HI>Barbary,</HI> were put out to Sea near Fifty Ve&s;&s;els, who guarded the Coa&s;ts,

<P>Seeing my &s;elf thus retained, and without much Commodities to live by, having already &s;pent the mo&s;t part of what I had, I was con&s;trained, in expectation of better Conveniency, to place my &s;elf with an Apothecary of St. <HI>Lucar,</HI> who made me promi&s;e to &s;erve him for &s;ome time.

and Difficulties which I have met withal: For I was but at my Mother's Brea&s;ts in the Year 1576. when my Fa|ther was Impri&s;oned at <HI>Meaux</HI> for being Surety for a Debt, which he was obliged to pay; and whil&s;t he had Permi&s;&s;ion to provide accordingly, it behoved my Mother to &s;upply his Place in the Pri|&s;on with me; and thus began I be|times to re&s;ent the Mi&s;eries of the World, which &s;ince in greater Age <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> have experienc'd more fully, and more roughly, in regard of my almo&s;t-conti|nual Ab&s;ence from my native Country, in &s;trange Lands, and remote Places, devoid of all Comfort, and expo&s;ed to all &s;orts of Mi&s;eries that could befall any Man; and moreover, &s;ince my Re|turn into mine own native Country, I have not been exempted from the like Misfortunes and Calamities, having had but very little Support from Men, a&s;|&s;i&s;ted only by the Providence of my God, who hath never for&s;aken me, but hath cau&s;ed the Afflictions which he hath plea&s;ed to &s;end me, to be an Ob|ject to &s;everal Per&s;ons of Honour to exerci&s;e towards me their Good and Laudable Charities.</P>
