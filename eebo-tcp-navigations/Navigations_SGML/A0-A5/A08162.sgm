<P>_I Am very loath to trouble you with a Pre|face, yet at this time you mu&s;t pardon me; for it is for Gods cau&s;e, to exemplifie his glory &amp; providence, that hath put an hook in the no&s;trils of <HI>Leviathan,</HI> and kept him from devouring poore <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who yet are in Armes to devoure one another: that hath throwne a &s;tone from Heaven to &s;trike the golden Image to powder, which was &s;tretching it &s;elfe, to overlooke and overtopp the <HI>Provinces</HI> of <HI>Europe;</HI> that hath put an Axe to the great tree, and felld it at a blow, which was beginning to over|&s;pread the earth, and be a &s;haddow for the bea&s;ts of the field. What, all <HI>Chri&s;tendome</HI> almo&s;t in Armes, and yet the <HI>Turke</HI> not to take the advantage, but to be pulld &s;hort by the hand of God, and throwne backward into a graue? Where are your dreaming <HI>Gazettes,</HI> and <HI>Coranto's</HI> now, that talkt of &s;uch formidable preparation, and &s;o many hun|dred thou&s;and in an Army? Where is the threatning of <HI>Po|land,</HI> and terrifying the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks</HI> with &s;o many thou&s;and <HI>Tartarians?</HI> Where is their comming into <HI>Hungary,</HI> to be|gin a new Warre there? What all hu&s;ht and quiet? Why, then thine be the honour O God, and all power, and maie&s;tie, and goodne&s;&s;e be attributed vnto thee? For thou ha&s;t taken pitty vpon our afflictions, and wilt &s;et vpright thine owne cau&s;e, when the children of <HI>Edom</HI> and inhabitants of <HI>Babylon,</HI> cry downe with the walls of <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> and in&s;ult with clapping
<PB REF="3"> their hands, to &s;ee the enemies of the Go&s;pell thriue in their outragiou&s;ne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>This then is all I would &s;ay vnto you by the way of Intro|duction, to giue God the pray&s;e, that the great <HI>Turke</HI> is dead &s;o opportunely, whereby there is hope, that <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hall be pre&s;erved from their inua&s;ion, and tho&s;e affrightings. And the &s;ame God, that hath compa&s;sionated the generall di&s;tre&s;&s;es of <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> take pittie likewi&s;e on the parti|cular pa&s;sions of <HI>Princes,</HI> that they rage not in their reven|ges, nor runne too violently forward in their race of bloud and de&s;truction; but admit of peace and pacification to the eternall memory of their vertues, and worthine&s;&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>THE STRANGLING AND DEATH, OF THE GREAT TVRKE, A STRANGE STORY.</HEAD>
<P>_THough I neede not &s;peake a word of former Em|perours of <HI>Turkey,</HI> or their actions, or their liues, or their <HI>Alcharon,</HI> from whence the &s;peciall im|po&s;itions on their Governerment are, fir&s;t, to erect &s;ome Famous <HI>Monument</HI> toward the exalta|tion of their Religion. Secondly, and performe &s;ome memorable enterpri&s;e for the enlarging their <HI>Empire:</HI> yet mu&s;t I name <HI>Mahomet</HI> the third, to keepe my &s;elfe clo&s;er to the Story, that you may know the &s;everall pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;ame. This <HI>Mahomet</HI> left two Sonnes behind him, <HI>Achmet</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;tapha; Achmet</HI> at 15. yeeres old was cho&s;en Emperor, and li|ved &s;ome 15. yeeres longer, or thereabouts and although by rea&s;on of the peace betweene the Emperour <HI>Rodulphus</HI> of <HI>Germany,</HI> &amp; him|&s;elfe, as al&s;o the contract betweene the <HI>Pelomans</HI> &amp; him&s;elfe, wher|in tho&s;e <HI>Antiqua foedera</HI> were renewed, he did little worthy of me|mory, concerning Heroijck enterpri&s;es, and military exploites: yet he had the Fortune to keepe corre&s;ponde~cy with his <HI>Bas&s;hawes,</HI> and <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and tooke a cour&s;e by enlarging their entertainement, and other &s;everall donatiues, to enlarge their heartes, and good li|king towards him: &s;o that he had very &s;eldome mutinies, or inno|vation, becau&s;e the <HI>Viceer</HI> of the Army drew them &s;till into the field in the Summer, and the <HI>Viceer</HI> of the City, afforded them their Aun|cient liberty in the Winter: but at la&s;t there was a rebellion by the <HI>Serivano</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> whom &s;ome confound with the name of <HI>Bas&s;haw</HI> of <HI>Alleppo,</HI> which was fortunately, and wi&s;ely prevented: and in the ende of his Raigne the controver&s;ies of the Princes of <HI>Molda|via,</HI> over wrought the <HI>Polacks</HI> to commi&s;erate the cau&s;e &amp; wrought a mi&s;chiefe, which was not ended without vn&s;peakeable trouble: For the di&s;ta&s;tings beginning in <HI>Achmets</HI> time, could never admit of reconciliation: till <HI>Achmets</HI> Sonne came in per&s;on with terror, and threatnings into the fieldes of <HI>Bogdonia.</HI></P>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<P>Well? <HI>Achmet</HI> dies, leaving 2. young Sonnes behind him, <HI>O&s;man</HI> and another: yet &s;ome will pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that being not aboue 34 yeeres old, he had many Children, and 300 Wiues or Concubines: but before he dyed, to make all &s;ure, he re&s;olues to &s;trangle his bro|ther <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and according to cu&s;tome will leaue no Competi|tors in &s;uch an <HI>Empire.</HI> For which purpo&s;e a Guard of <HI>Capagies</HI> at|tend at the Iron gates of the <HI>Seralio,</HI> and the <HI>Mutes</HI> are placed in a roome accordingly. Now you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that though they haue many wayes to enlarge their cruelties, and di&s;patch offenders, yet none is &s;o affrighting, as the pre&s;enting of the&s;e Officers, for they never come along without death in their company, and gha&s;tlines in their lookes. Sometimes an offender is carried from the <HI>Seralio,</HI> by the Officers of their <HI>Tapinaco,</HI> &s;uch as we &s;ay M^r. of the Ordna~ce, over the Sea, &amp; in the midway a great &s;tone is tyed about his neck, and he is ca&s;t into the bottome, and then according to his greatnes, a greater Cannon is &s;hot off, vnle&s;&s;e the Emperour &s;end a counter|mand; er he be from the water: &s;ometimes an offender is beheaded: &s;ometimes throwne off a rocke: &s;ometimes &s;et vpon by the <HI>Ianiza|ries,</HI> &amp; cut in peeces, as the <HI>Haga</HI> or Captaine is limited, yet in the&s;e ca&s;es as the Emperors fury is leniated, they many times e&s;cape: but when the <HI>Mutes</HI> come in place, all are di&s;placed, again&s;t whom their Commi&s;&s;ion is enlarged. Thus is <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> to be di&s;patched, but &s;ee how the &s;tronger arme puts out the &s;trong men? the &s;ame night <HI>Achmet</HI> had a <HI>dreame</HI> or fearefull <HI>vi&s;ion,</HI> which &s;ome of the <HI>Deruices</HI> would needes pre&s;ume to rumor abroad, in this manner; that hee thought as he was entring into the 7. Towers, the princely pri&s;on of his Predece&s;&s;ors, his brother kneeled downe before him, and cry|ed out, Oh when &s;hal we leaue this horrible cu&s;tome of &s;hedding in|nocent blood? looke among all the Heathens, and &s;ee, how quickly they loathed and ca&s;t away that crying Sin of &s;acrificing of humane fle&s;h? but in &s;teede of replying he drew his Semiter to &s;trike off his head, had not one as hee conceited held it fa&s;t, that hee could not &s;trike; whereupon he demanded angerly, what art thou? I am the good <HI>Genius</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and will not &s;uffer him to peri&s;h, there|fore leaue: and very &s;hortly &s;hall &s;trange things happen in the <HI>Em|pire.</HI> Little thought the great Turke, to haue found a greater Greatne&s;&s;e in his &s;leepe, but &s;uch was the power of God, or as
<PB REF="4"> the Turkes conceited the fortune of <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> that his bro|ther <HI>Achmate</HI> contrary to all expectation the next morning after his Dreame, &s;ent for him into the roome of <HI>State,</HI> where he lay on as &s;tately a Pallet, with all his <HI>Viceroys</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> groueling on the ground, and the principall <HI>Mufty</HI> knee|ling before him reading on a booke. It &s;hould &s;eeme that glad tydings came fir&s;t to the Citie; For hee was taken out of the pri&s;on with great re&s;pect, and ob&s;eruation: hee was admitted to his Gally with high ceremonies, and yet &s;olemne countenances: hee was accompanied on the Sea with thou|&s;ands of boates, and tenne thou&s;and of weeping eyes: hee landed at the Emperours one <HI>Caska</HI> with great re&s;pect and mode&s;t &s;tilne&s;&s;e: hee walked through the Garden of <HI>Cipres</HI> trees, and at la&s;t came to an iron gate, where his owne com|pany left him, except two <HI>Ba&s;hawes,</HI> who led him by the armes: the gate opens and he mu&s;t through a gard of <HI>Cupo|gies,</HI> they bend to the ground, and yet looke cheerefully: till at la&s;t the Prince &s;pake as cheerefully to the <HI>Ba&s;hawes,</HI> &s;aying What need all this quoile and ceremonies to a dying man? or tormenting of my &s;oule, when I goe to the execu|tion of my body? in all extremities there is a curte&s;ie in di|&s;patch, and when a man mu&s;t dye, Oh let him dye at once, and not be more tortured with the feare and circum&s;tances, then with the thing it &s;elfe: they dur&s;t not reply; but brought him into the roome, where the <HI>Mutes</HI> &s;tood: who&s;e pre|&s;ence did no more appall him then the re&s;t, but that hee &s;aw the cruelty confirmed, and their very &s;ight was wor&s;e, then an vnreuer&s;able iudgement: but when hee perceiued no violent hands laid vpon him, and that he mu&s;t yet goe further, he was the more a&s;toni&s;hed, and the more vexed to endure &s;uch a procra&s;tination.</P>
<P>At la&s;t he came where the Emperour lay &s;icke on his Pal|let, before whom his pro&s;titution was as the ordinary &s;laues: but contrary to all expectation he bad him ri&s;e, and comman|ded certaine Per&s;ian Carpets to be &s;pread, &amp; rich Cu&s;hions to be laid; on which, according to their manner, he &s;ate cro&s;&s;e legg'd by him, and when the <HI>Mufty</HI> had rai&s;ed the Emperor
<PB REF="5"> vp a little, with a faint voyce, he thus di&s;couered an vnlookt for louing heart.</P>
<P>Brother (&s;aid hee) I am taught by &s;tory, and the &s;tory of <HI>Galba</HI> among the Romanes, to chu&s;e a Succe&s;&s;or for the com|mon-wealth, and not an heire in my family. This made him looke vpon <HI>Pi&s;o,</HI> as worthy to be an Emperour, becau&s;e hee had experience of his vertues, and not vpon his kindred, be|cau&s;e hee was vnacquainted with their &s;trength to beare &s;o great a burthen: I cannot compare our greatne&s;&s;e with the Romanes, but I am &s;ure wee are too great for children, or fooles: I haue faire i&s;&s;ue of my owne, but &s;o weake armes cannot &s;way the Scepter of our <HI>Othoman</HI> family, and to leaue them vnder <HI>Tutelage,</HI> Who is there worthy to adui&s;e &s;uch Princes, or what account can &s;laues make of the gouern|ment, when their owne vices &s;hall ouerflow their bankes without re&s;traint, and the enuie of others look vpon them ra|ther with di&s;obedience, then ob&s;eruation? therefore to auoid all tumultuous occa&s;ions, and to make thee beleeue, thou art the charge of our <HI>Prophet Mahomet:</HI> in &s;teed of death-like pre&s;ents it &s;elfe in &s;teed of a pri&s;on: this is thy Pallace, and whereas thou cam&s;t in groueling, thou &s;halt goe out trium|phing: the decree of heauen will haue it &s;o, and a voyce from heauen commands it &s;o; only this I mu&s;t conclude, that as I haue remembred thee, thou wilt not forget me and mine, let not cu&s;tome ouerma&s;ter vertue, nor the iealou&s;ie in Soue|raignty be an enemy to thy pitty: but let young <HI>O&s;man</HI> liue as I haue determined, thou &s;halt not dye: yea, the wonder is the greater, that of a captiue I haue made thee an Empe|rour, and in &s;teed of the terrors of affliction, brought thee out to the raui&s;hings of <HI>Maie&s;tie.</HI></P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner done, but he began to faint, and &s;o read them all a le&s;&s;on of mortality by opening a booke, wherein they &s;aw death writ in Capitall letters, and him&s;elfe &s;inking pa&s;t recouery, which made them recouer new Spirits, and pre&s;ently bring his brother out into the <HI>Sophia,</HI> where the principall <HI>Mufty</HI> proclaimed <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Emperour, intima|ting to the Ianizaries the charge of <HI>Achmate,</HI> to the di&s;char|ging

<P>But oh the condition of man, and in&s;tability of terre&s;tiall ble&s;&s;ings!

<P>The&s;e &s;peeches to the turbulent Ianizaries, were like fewell to fire, and the pre&s;ence of the louely youth, made them amazed at their incon&s;tancie: &s;o that by way of penitencie and &s;atisfaction, they quickly altered the acclamation of liue <HI>Mu|&s;tapha</HI> into the cries of, God &s;aue young <HI>O&s;man,</HI> and &s;o with|out further di&s;puting, hee was aduanced into the Throne, and brought into the <HI>Seralio,</HI> when <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> lea&s;t thought of the alteration.

<P>When all thinges were &s;etled, the Tartars after their accu&s;to|med manner with great clamours and outcryes, and with as great multitudes gaue vpon the Polonians, and thought to haue

<P>Now, you that are &s;o powerfull in in&s;olency and tumults, and were &s;o forward to the War, that we mu&s;t either take the Field to &s;pend your humors, and &s;atisfie your impatience, or be taken by you, &amp; &s;uffer the indignity of your outrages, what &s;ay you now to the Warre? what can you doe to the&s;e men? nay, what will you doe for the Emperors Honor, and your own reputation? well, &s;eeing you &s;ee by experience, that the times are changed, and the di&s;cipline of Warre mu&s;t take you out o|ther le&s;&s;ons of fury, leaue your fooli&s;h finding fault with your friends: and &s;pend your courages vpon your enemies? there is now no retiring by Mutinies, but &s;etting forward vpon aduan|tages, you mu&s;t either force the&s;e Trenches, or be enforced to indure a &s;laughter: But I will now an&s;wer for you, what is pa&s;t is remedile&s;&s;e, we come to Fight, and I know, you are re&s;o|lute to play the men, therefore follow me, and I will leade you the way to death or Glory: wherupon without any reply, they came forward with 50000. and vnder the &s;ecurity of a rowling Trench gaue a braue Camizado on the <HI>Polonian</HI> Campe, with many pieces of Ordnance, which they mounted vpon prety bankes, as the Pyoners ca&s;t vp the earth before them.</P>
<P>But as they were in this forwardnes rhe Co&s;&s;ackes came &s;o violently vpon the vnarmed <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they were &s;ubiect to
<PB REF="8"> a great &s;laughter, &s;o that both they and the Ianizaries were glad to retire with lo&s;&s;e, and the young Emperor vnacquainted with the Warre, was yet acquainted with Oathes and Cur&s;es, to chide both him&s;elfe and Fortune. At la&s;t the Ba&s;hawes &s;eeing no remedy and finding &s;o great ob&s;tacles of their attempts, pro|iected the pre&s;eruation of the <HI>Emperors</HI> per&s;on; but it may be to &s;ecure their owne liues, &amp; &s;o entrenched them&s;elues, being (as they &s;aid) the fir&s;t time that euer &s;o great an Army of <HI>Turkes</HI> was enclo&s;ed within walles, by which occa&s;ion, nece&s;&s;ity com|peld them to confe&s;&s;e, they had new worke in hand, and that there was nothing &s;o ea&s;ie, as to cry to the warre, but nothing &s;o difficult as to returne with Victory.</P>
<P>In this manner they lay all the Summer looking vpon one an|other with reuengefull eyes, and taking the aduantage of &s;o many Sallies, that the Turke lo&s;t at lea&s;t in &s;euerall Skirmi&s;hes 50000. men: For many times they met about the &s;eeking of Victuall, and there fought it out: many times they encountred in forraging, and getting proui&s;ion for their Hor&s;es: many times their courages were &s;o exa&s;perated, that with equall incoun|ters and appointed Sallies they returned home againe, finding the i&s;&s;ue nothing but &s;laughter and bloud, and many times they determined to deceiue one another by taking the Riuers and pa&s;&s;ing the Foords, which ended not without de&s;truction, and peri&s;hing of whole Companies. As for &s;et Battails, or one dayes tryall by equall agreement of both parties, it neuer came to &s;o formidable a bu&s;ines, or remarkable aduenture: and therefore I can but wonder at the &s;hamele&s;&s;e reports of &s;trange men, and weake Certificates by <HI>Corantes</HI> from Foraine parts, e&s;pecially to haue them Printed, to talke of &s;o many Thou&s;ands &s;laine, the Prince kill'd, <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> defeated, and the whole Army put to flight, when yet as I &s;aid, there was neuer any &s;uch matter, nor any &s;et Battaile fought.</P>
<P>Yet although the <HI>Polonians</HI> had rather the better, then the Turkes, they did not runne away &s;o fa&s;t with pro&s;perity, but they were &s;ubiect to many inconueniences, and they &s;awe plainely the warres were no May-games: For they endu|^^red both Hunger and Colde, &s;lacknes of payment, and ^^their entertainment came many times &s;hort: The Noble</P>

<P>The noble Generall died in the Campe, the Prince lay &s;icke of a Feuer, their hor&s;e mi&s;carried, and other lamenta|ble effects taught them extraordinary patience, which made them attend good conditions of peace, and when they found they might be entertained, they were not &s;crupulous or thought it any de&s;paragement to propo&s;e the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When the Ba&s;hawes were thus di&s;appointed (e&s;pecially <HI>Mehemet Ba&s;haw</HI>) who was euer an enemy to the <HI>Moldauian</HI> bu&s;ines, and that he &s;aw the yong Emperour euery way di&s;|contented, but e&s;pecially with him&s;elfe, as blaming his owne vnhappine&s;&s;e, that hee &s;hould in the fir&s;t triall of his manhood be &s;o vnfortunate, as to open the doore of Chri|&s;tian apprehen&s;ion; that the <HI>Othoman</HI> fame was now at the highe&s;t, and the Turki&s;h Empire &s;ubiect to diminution: hee went another way to worke, and per&s;waded the yong Prince to make tryall of another time, and peace for the pre|&s;ent: nay he did talke of another countrey, to which when the Turke angerly replyed, he would die fir&s;t, hee enforced the argument that it &s;hould be to his honour, and the <HI>Polack</HI> &s;hould &s;eeke it with great mediation.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, the yong Emperour &s;hed teares, and was more a|fraid of his di&s;ceputation among his &s;ouldiers, then glad of a|ny pacification of the pre&s;ent troubles; yet nece&s;&s;itie had no law, and he was in the end compelled to the propo&s;ed com|po&s;ition. But how? By a polliticke contriuing the bu&s;ines, and &s;ecret workings of more nimble &s;pirits: for pre&s;ently a Prie&s;t of <HI>Moldauia</HI> was &s;et on worke to go among the <HI>Po|lonians,</HI> and by way of generall complaint again&s;t the outra|gious effects of warre, to enlarge the happine&s;&s;e of peace, and inferre what a ble&s;&s;ing it were to procure the &s;ame: whereupon hee was brought to the yong Prince of <HI>Poland,</HI> and commanders of the Army, with whom hee at la&s;t pre|uailed &s;o well, and &s;o farre, that they &s;ent a &s;olemne Emba&s;&s;ie to the great Turke, as he lay entrenched in the fields, to en|treate a peace, and de&s;ire the renouation of the <HI>antiqua pucta,</HI> which had been euer betweene the two nations. The Turke had learnd his le&s;&s;on &s;o well, that hee &s;eemed to make the
<PB N="12" REF="9"> matter &s;trange and of great humiliation, if he &s;hould con&s;ent thereunto, and rather a curte&s;ie granted then a nece&s;&s;itie im|po&s;ed, and &s;o deferred them a while, till at la&s;t (as if he had bin ouer-wrought by the interce&s;&s;ion and mediation of his Ba|&s;hawes) he was contented to capitulate the matter, and after many meetings, and a great deale of conference, articles were drawne, and confirmed with a kinde of &s;olemnity, and pro|claimed by &s;ound of trumpet in both the campes.</P>
<P>But &s;ee the condition of men, and the inconueniences that great Emperours are &s;ubiect vnto? for all the <HI>Ianizaries</HI> them&s;elues neither dur&s;t, nor could maintaine the warre any longer, and were indeed affronted with an ouer-ma&s;tring power, and an ouer-ruling di&s;cipline of warre: yet they ra|ther complained of the Emperor, as being vnfortunate, then their owne cowardice, as being ouer-mated, and &s;o brake vp the campe with a kinde of murmuring and repining. The great Turke tooke ea&s;ie iourneys toward <HI>Andrinopolis,</HI> where he di&s;charged the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and &s;ent mo&s;t of his <HI>Ianizaries</HI> be|fore hand to <HI>Con&s;tantinople.

<P>By Chri&s;tmas <HI>O&s;man</HI> comes home, and had the accu&s;tomed acclamations of the people, with all the ceremonies of his re|turne, whereupon he goes in great pompe to the <HI>Sophia,</HI> and had the v&s;efull guard of his Court <HI>Ianizaries</HI> to attend him: but within &s;hort &s;pace many fearefull accidents appalled them all, and &s;uch a mi&s;chiefe followed, as they could not example by any pre&s;ident.

Secondly, they were afrighted at a great fire hapning among&s;t the <HI>Iewes,</HI> which they pre&s;aged ominous to the gouernment. Thirdly, a &s;ore earthquake made their hearts quake for feare: but this is &s;o v&s;uall in tho&s;e parts by rea&s;on of the a&s;cending vp the hills, and many Cauerns vn|der

Fourthly, the Sea &s;welling extraordinarily, and the winde from the Southwe&s;t driuing the billowes into the corner of the harbour, made &s;uch a noy&s;e and formidable &s;ound, as catching the tackles of the &s;hips and gallies in his whi&s;tling, that they were affraid euen of common accidents.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, and wor&s;t of all, by rea&s;on of the great con|cour&s;e of people, and re&s;ort of &s;trangers, &s;uch a famine happe|ned in the city, and dearth in the countrey, that euery one complained, and though it was remedile&s;&s;e by the pollicy of man, yet was the fault layed vpon Superiours, and the Emperour him&s;elfe did not e&s;cape &s;candall and calumnia|tion.</P>
<P>For while the <HI>&V;iceers</HI> and principall Officers endeuoured the common good, and &s;tudied the Weale publike, which could not be done, but by di&s;charging the Citie of multi|tudes of Inhabitants; all was interpreted to be done for their priuate wealth, and ambitious ouer-ruling of others: but when it came to the di&s;charging of many <HI>Ianizaries</HI> and &s;ouldiers out of the Citie, to liue as it were in garri&s;on in the Countrey, and that the Emperour was &s;lacke in their Dona|tiues, and former allowances out of his Trea&s;urie; they &s;tor|med beyond mea&s;ure, and threatened the <HI>&V;iceers</HI> and <HI>Ba|&s;hawes</HI> to haue a better account of the Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; crying out, they would not be quiet, till they were imployed in one Seruice, or other. To this the <HI>&V;iceer</HI> replyed, that hee wondered at their ba&s;ene&s;&s;e and audaciou&s;ne&s;&s;e, that ha|uing fayled in all their Enterpri&s;es, they dur&s;t yet com|plaine of any accident, more then their owne cowardize.

<P>To come to a conclu&s;ion; neuer was &s;o violent an act &s;o &s;uddenly performed, nor &s;o quickly repented: For the <HI>Iani|zaries</HI> &s;tood amazed at their owne villanie, &amp; by night there was not a man &s;eene, that dur&s;t iu&s;tifie their trea&s;ons; for they fled for the pre&s;ent, no man knew whither, and tho&s;e which remained, were afraid to &s;tand for the glory of the Hou&s;e of <HI>O&s;man,</HI> but they would liue and die in the obedience of a worthy Emperor.</P>
<P>But how this vprore cea&s;ed, or tumult was appea&s;ed: what offendors bee taken, or how puni&s;hed: what <HI>Ba&s;hawes</HI> bee &s;laine, or from whence others are admitted: by what meanes the Doctors of the Law came together againe, or whether they e&s;caped; if you long to know, I long as much to informe you: which (if I may doe) I will doe, ac|cording to the next Certificate that comes.</P>
