<PB REF="6">his death, he took a long Voyage into <HI>Syria,</HI> and there staid till he had perfected his skill in that Language. I may very well here mention, our worthy profe&s;&s;or of the <HI>He|brew</HI> and <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongues in <HI>Oxford, Dr. Edward Pocock,</HI> who was long abroad at <HI>Alep|po,</HI> and other places on the &s;ame account.

The learned works he hath publi&s;hed, give ample Te&s;timony of the skil he attain|ed in the Arabick, e&s;pecially by
<PB REF="6">that long Voyage. The Je&s;uits them&s;elves and others write much, how indu&s;trious the Je|&s;uits were in the propagation of the Chri&s;tian Faith, and how they have &s;own the &s;eed of &s;a|ving truth in <HI>China</HI> or el&s;e|where.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> in the <HI>2d.</HI> part of his last Book of Christiani|ty, <HI>c. 14. p. 488.</HI> &s;aith, The at|tempts of the Je&s;uits in <HI>Congo, Japon</HI> and <HI>China</HI> were a very noble work, and &s;o were the <HI>Portugal</HI> Kings encourage|ments: but two things &s;poiled their &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>First, That when they took down the Heathens Images, they &s;et them up others in their
<PB REF="7">stead; and made them think that the main difference was, but who&s;e Image they &s;hould wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Secondly, But e&s;pecially, that they made them &s;ee, that while they pretended to promote Re|ligion, and to &s;ave their &s;ouls, they came to promote their own wealth, or the Popes Domini|on, and to bring their Kings under a Forein power.</P>
<P>The honest attempts of Mr. <HI>Eliots</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> is much more agreeable to the A|postles way,

<P><HI>Ju&s;tus Heurnius</HI> (&s;on to <HI>John Heurnius</HI> the learned Phy&s;ician) left the &s;tudy of
<PB REF="7">Phy&s;ick, and wholly gave him|&s;elf to the &s;tudy of Divinity, that thereby he might be the better inabled to promote the Conver&s;ion of the Indians, and taking an Evangelical Em|ba&s;&s;ie to the Indies, he there abode above <HI>14</HI> Years, preach|ing to the Indians in their Mo|ther Tongue, Catechi&s;ing them, and admoni&s;hing them pri|vately, and by his &s;ingular in|nocen&s;ie,

<P><HI>Keckerman</HI> in the book and chapter before quoted, &s;aith, a mile is either proper, containing a 1000 paces, which being alwaies u&s;ed in <HI>Italy,</HI> is called <HI>Ita|lian,</HI> or improper, either a league or a <HI>German</HI> mile: A league (&s;aith he) is either old, that is, a proper mile and a half, or new, (which they call a <HI>French</HI> mile) two proper miles. Four <HI>German</HI> mile is either common 4000 paces, or great, 5 thou&s;and paces.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> met out their di&s;tance of places by <HI>Leagues,
