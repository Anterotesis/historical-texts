<HEAD>THE ORATION AND PROPOSITIONS made on <HI>Barnavelt's</HI> and his fellow-Pri&s;o|ners behalfe, by the <HI>French</HI> Kings <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> to the generall E&s;tates of the vnited Prouinces of HOLLAND, &amp;c. at the pre&s;enting of his Maie&s;ties Letters vnto the &s;aid E&s;tates.</HEAD>
<P>_MY Lords, the King our Ma&s;ter commanded vs, to recommend vnto you the &s;ame which we haue heretofore at other times motioned, touch|ing the good, and peace of your e&s;tate: although it hath not bin con&s;ide|red according to the worthine&s;&s;e of the merit of his alliance and amitie: but in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of your affaires, his Maie|&s;tie will not cea&s;e to witne&s;&s;e vnto you, that he hath no le&s;&s;e care thereof, then of the peace and tranqui|litie of his owne Kingdome.</P>
<P>We will therefore proceede to exhort you, to continue &s;tedfa&s;t in the vnion of your Prouinces, as the principall foundation of your e&s;tate, and to be
<PB REF="3">carefull, that the changing of Magi&s;trates and Coun&s;ellors, which hath bin made in diuers of your Townes, doe not breede enmities and di&s;&s;entions among your Citizens, in&s;tead of cea&s;ing them; for that, all mutations and changes of Magi&s;trates, Lawes, and policies are dangerous to publique go|uernements, if they be not made vpon great ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and &s;o profitable for the Commons, that no man may haue cau&s;e to di&s;like them: Therefore it is requi&s;ite for you to take order, that the Magi|&s;trates, by their good and iu&s;t proceedings and be|hauiours, may obtaine and de&s;erue the good-will of the people; and &s;hew them&s;elues &s;o mode&s;t to|wards them that are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, that the incon&s;tant multitude may haue no occa&s;ion to repine at &s;uch alteration; and that tho&s;e that haue bin depo&s;ed from their charges, &s;hould patiently endure and beare that alteration, as being made for the com|mon good of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sinode</HI> which you haue cau&s;ed to be a&s;&s;em|bled, puts vs in good hope that it will be a meanes to procure peace and concord touching tho&s;e points of Religion, which haue bred trouble and &s;chi&s;me in the&s;e Prouinces among you: To make it effectuall and fruitfull, it is requi&s;ite that it &s;hould be free, and &s;ecure for all tho&s;e that &s;hall therein a&s;&s;emble together, and that the points in contro|uer&s;ie &s;hould be examined and di&s;puted of, without pa&s;&s;ion, or for any other con&s;ideration, then onely for the honour of God, and the peace of mens con|&s;ciences.</P>
<P>And certainely, who&s;oeuer taketh vpon him to
<PB REF="3">interpret, or attaine vnto tho&s;e high mi&s;teries and trea&s;ures of diuine wi&s;edome, without great humi|lity and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; &s;hall finde him&s;elfe as farre off from them, as he thinketh he approacheth neere vnto them.</P>
<P>We are likewi&s;e to tell you &s;omewhat from the King, touching your Pri&s;oners, and to &s;hew you, how much it concerneth the honour and reputati|on of your affaires, and generally the peace of your Prouinces, and concord among your &s;ubiects, to admini&s;ter vnto them good and &s;peedy Iu&s;tice. They are accu&s;ed of the mo&s;t inorme and dete&s;ta|ble crimes that can be, as of Trea&s;on again&s;t their natiue Countrey, &s;ecret intelligence with your ene|mies, and for hauing expo&s;ed your Townes vnto the danger of pillage, and effu&s;ion of blood.</P>
<P>If they be culpable of the&s;e di&s;loyalties, the King our Ma&s;ter giueth you coun&s;ell and adui&s;e to exer|ci&s;e the rigour of your Lawes again&s;t them. But as tho&s;e crimes are grieuous, and worthy of mo&s;t great puni&s;hment; &s;o they haue beene reduced to cer|taine points, whereunto good and wi&s;e Princes, and well gouerned common-wealths would not &s;tretch them.</P>
<P>To the contrary, diuers Princes haue &s;hewed them&s;elues ready to pardon, euen &s;uch enterpri&s;es as haue bin done again&s;t their owne per&s;ons: and the free&s;t Common-wealths, alwaies v&s;ed to &s;pare the blood of their Citizens; and that in the greate&s;t malefactors; it being one of the principalle&s;t &s;ignes of liberty and freedome, not ea&s;ily or lightly to touch the life of Citizens.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>Therefore the crime of Trea&s;on ought to be ta|ken and vnder&s;tood in her proper tearmes, with|out drawing it by con&s;equences and inductions to other actions which are not of the &s;ame quality. The contentions which oftentimes ari&s;e and are made in the management of affaires, the iealou&s;ies of power and authority, and ambition which al|waies drawes and driues men to enterpri&s;e and take more vpon them then they &s;hould, are ordi|nary euils in all &s;tates; whereby many inconueni|ences and mi&s;chiefes en&s;ew. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, they were neuer e&s;teemed nor held to be trea&s;on again&s;t the State, becau&s;e crimes and offences are iudged by the will and intent, and not by the euent.</P>
<P>We doubt not, my Lords, but that in your in|tegrities and wi&s;edomes you make di&s;tinction as you &s;hould, of the faith and actions whereof men are accu&s;ed; que&s;tion being made of the liues of your officers &amp; &s;ubiects placed in authority, wher|of one is the aunciente&s;t Coun&s;ellor of your &s;tate, which is <HI>Mon&s;ieur Barneuelt,</HI> &s;o much commended for the good and notable &s;eruices by him done for the&s;e countries, whereof the Princes and States and allies vnto the &s;ame are witne&s;&s;es, that it is hardly to be thought or beleeued, that he &s;hould haue con&s;pired trea&s;on again&s;t his natiue Countrie, for the which you your &s;elues know hee hath taken &s;o great paines: neuerthele&s;&s;e &s;eeing he is called in que&s;tion by order of Law, it importeth the &s;ecu|rity of your e&s;tate, that the truth &s;hould be known; which to doe, you ought both for him, and the re&s;t al&s;o to appoint Iudges that are neither &s;u&s;pected
<PB REF="4">nor pa&s;&s;ionate, that iudge according to the Lawes of the Countrey, vpon cleere and euident proofes, as equitie requireth, and not vpon coniectures and pre&s;umptions, which oftentimes deceiue Iudges; becau&s;e there are many things that are apparant and very likely, which neuerthele&s;&s;e are not true; and others that are true, and yet haue no likeli|ne&s;&s;e thereof: and &s;o by moderate and vpright Iudgement, you &s;hall manife&s;t vnto the world, that you are worthy of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and commande|ment of this e&s;tate, to the gouernement whereof God hath called you.</P>
<P>The coun&s;ell which the King giueth you, touch|ing the&s;e Pri&s;oners, is, not to v&s;e rigour again&s;t them; but rather fauour and clemency, as mo&s;t ac|ceptable vnto God, and fit and conuenient to win the hearts of the people, &amp; to make them obe|dient. It is the &s;ecurity of States, &s;uch as yours is, to revnite your &s;ubiects which are diuided, and to molefie and appea&s;e the di&s;likes and bitterne&s;&s;e, which is among them; wherevnto we haue &s;peci|all charge to adde his Maie&s;ties reque&s;t and recom|mendation, in re&s;pect of the intere&s;t which he hath in the pre&s;eruation of your State, and his know|ledge of the great &s;eruices, which this Pri&s;oner hath done for you; as al&s;o of the affection; which he al|wayes bare to the maintenance of the alliance be|tweene <HI>France</HI> and this State, &s;o notable actions and te&s;timonies of his loyaltie and fidelity, that they &s;eeme to exclude all &s;u&s;pition of trea&s;on and di&s;loyaltie; and whereof as yet, his Maie&s;ty can|not
<PB REF="5">hold or thinke him to be culpable, vntill by euident proofes you make the crime manife&s;t vn|to him.</P>
<P>Now after &s;o many good adui&s;es, which are on the Kings behalfe propounded vnto you, if you, for your parts, rather chu&s;e a rigorous cour&s;e, his Ma|ie&s;tie &s;hall haue &s;ufficient glory and &s;atisfaction, to haue, like a true friend and allie, giuen you whole|&s;ome and &s;ound coun&s;els, whereof the v&s;e and e|uent will be as happy and profitable for your State, as the contrary is hurtfull and dangerous: And his Maie&s;tie cannot chu&s;e but be much offen|ded at the &s;mall re&s;pect which you &s;till make of his coun&s;els, reque&s;ts, and amitie, which thereby may procure as much &s;lackne&s;&s;e, as in times pa&s;t you haue found promptne&s;&s;e and fa|uourablene&s;&s;e in your neede.

<HEAD>The generall <HI>States</HI> an&s;were to the Propo&s;itions, made vnto them by the French KINGS Amba&s;&s;adors.</HEAD>
<P>_THe STATES generall of the vnited Prouinces, hauing in o|pen a&s;&s;embly, heard, and deli|berately perv&s;ed the Propo&s;i|tions of <HI>Me&s;sieurs do Boi&s;si&s;e</HI> &amp; <HI>du Morier,</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors of the mo&s;t chri&s;tian King of <HI>France,</HI> deliuered by word of mouth the 12 of this month, and the next day in writing, by vertue of their Let|ters of Credit, bearing date the 28. of <HI>Nouember.</HI> &s;ignifie and declare, that as they haue had nothing in more &s;ingular recommendation, then by the vp|rightnes of their actions and gouernments, to giue all good meanes and occa&s;ions vnto his <HI>Maie&s;tie,</HI> to moue him to continue his royall fauours and aides (following the example of the late King, of immor|tall memory &amp; incomparable wi&s;dome) vnto them, for the good and maintenance of their Common|wealth: to the which end al&s;o, they haue alwayes carefully, in their need, &s;ought for and imbraced his whole&s;ome coun&s;els, adui&s;es, and fauours, again&s;t the threatnings, deui&s;es and powers of their ene|mies, for the which they are oblieged to giue and yeeld all kinde of thankes and gratefulnes vnto his <HI>Maie&s;tie</HI> and kingdome: So they are exceedingly much grieued, to perceiue them&s;elues to be mi&s;ta|ken, and taxed, not to haue re&s;olued vpon the
<PB REF="6">affaires done for them vpon occa&s;ion of the&s;e la&s;t motions, touching the good of this <HI>State,</HI> according to the merit of his alliance and amitie, becau&s;e they cannot conceiue wherevpon this complaint of di&s;|like &s;hould be grounded; in regard that they haue alwaies had a &s;peciall care, mo&s;t exactly to ob&s;erue and keepe all the points, &amp; Articles of Couenants, which they haue had the honour to haue con|tracted and renewed with his Maie&s;tie, not once neglecting any clau&s;e thereof, whereby the lea&s;t cau&s;e or occa&s;ion of di&s;contentment, or iealou&s;ie might grow or ari&s;e; and therefore the &s;aid <HI>States,</HI> a&s;&s;ure them&s;elues, that continuing the &s;ame cour&s;e for the &s;ecuritie of their &s;tate, which hitherto they haue carefully held and ob&s;erued, in the &s;trict a|mity, and confederation wherewith the two Kings con&s;equently haue vouch&s;afed to honour him, his maie&s;tie will not at this pre&s;ent make any other con&s;truction of their wills, and pre&s;ent carriages, then that which is requi&s;ite to be made of a &s;tate which is mo&s;t thankefull for, and memoratiue of, his fauours and benefits, and no le&s;&s;e de&s;irous to &s;hew the continuance of the mo&s;t &s;trict bond there|of, in all re&s;pects which &s;hall be thought or found to be profitable for the &s;eruice of his Maie&s;tie, and conuenient for their owne &s;ecuritie.</P>
<P>Neuerthele&s;&s;e the &s;aid &s;tates, receiue and accept of, (as a mo&s;t great fauour) the good and whole|&s;ome coun&s;ells which it plea&s;eth his Maie&s;tie to giue them, in this pre&s;ent e&s;tate wherein their affai|res now &s;tand, exhorting them to remaine firme and con&s;tant in the vnion of their prouinces, be|cau&s;e
<PB REF="6">they are altogether conformable to their in|tents; for they haue alwaies had the &s;ame de&s;ire and de&s;igne, &s;pecially to be carefull of the meanes to pre&s;erue and defend their &s;tate again&s;t their ene|mies, and to v&s;e their friends and Allies worthily, according to their quallities and degrees.</P>
<P>They al&s;o &s;ay that they haue not without great &amp; good con&s;ideration beene moued to change cer|taine of their Magi&s;trates, in &s;ome of their Townes: whereof it may be, the report hath beene other|wi&s;e &s;pread abroad, then the ca&s;e requireth, &s;eeing that the remedy was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary &amp; ea&s;ie being wi&s;ely and moderately applyed, without any vio|lence or danger of bloud-&s;hedding, in &s;uch manner that publique authority, vnion by peace, and a&s;&s;u|rance again&s;t di&s;orders are entirely e&s;tabli&s;hed, which certaine ambitious &amp; factious &s;pirits would haue much altered, not without great danger, (if longer forbearance &amp; patience had beene v&s;ed) to ouerthrow and de&s;troy all the &s;tate, and to the ru|ine and de&s;olation of good men, and to the preiu|dice of his Maie&s;tie, &amp; the good of his kingdome.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that, they haue onely made a nece&s;&s;ary change of &s;ome certaine per&s;ons, not once thereby touching or altering the lawes, rights or pollicies of their Townes; neither haue they had any other intent or meaning in their elections of new Magi|&s;trates, then onely to cea&s;e the great partialities that haue crept in among them, by the practi&s;e of factious per&s;ons, which in tho&s;e Townes and fa|milies proceeded &s;o farre as to erect Alter again&s;t Alter: and in the &s;ame changes they haue placed
<PB REF="7">none but &s;uch per&s;ons as are well quallified, faith|full, and affected to their Countrie, who without doubt, by their vpright and iu&s;t behauiour, know full well how to procure and get the good-will of the people, and to pre&s;erue and defend the <HI>State</HI> from all violent alterations or motions; and that in many Townes the proofe of this lenitie alreadie appeareth, in that the order which hath beene re|effabli&s;hed for the protection and defence of Inno|cents, again&s;t the fir&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, is already nota|ble and plea&s;ing, whereby all the members of this <HI>State</HI> con&s;pire and con&s;ent together to ca&s;t off and abandon their bad motions, and to raunge them|&s;elues vnder lawfull obedience, by voluntarie ac|knowledging of their &s;uperiours: And that if this proceeding of their factious &s;ubiects had drawne them vnto any greatextreamity, they would hope|fully haue relied vpon the ordinary good will of his Maie&s;tie, for their &s;upport and meanes, which might haue failed them, by their power to haue re|dre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e confu&s;ions, which by the mercie and goodne&s;&s;e of God they did in time preuent, with|out trouble or extraordinary charge to their allies.</P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Sinode,</HI> which hath beene called and a&s;&s;embled together in the&s;e Prouinces, they al|waies certainely beleeued, that therby &s;ome means of peace and concord concerning, tho&s;e points of religion which haue bin the cau&s;e to admini&s;ter trouble in the Churches of &s;ome of their <HI>Prouinces,</HI> would be found, e&s;teeming it the mo&s;t meet, aun|cient, and lawfull meanes thereunto, v&s;ed in the pri|matiue Church, euen in the time of the <HI>Apo&s;tles:</HI>
<PB REF="7">But what meanes &s;oeuer they haue heretofore v&s;ed to obtaine and publi&s;h that conuocation, it was neuer till now in their power to attaine to that holy and whole&s;ome remedie, to rule and &s;top the differences in their fir&s;t birth: And his <HI>Maie&s;ty</HI> may well call to minde and remember, if it plea&s;eth him, the intreaties and humble motions diuers times made by them vnto him, to be ayded and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this good worke, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of his &s;ubiects, cho&s;en out of the reformed Churches in his Realme; but were cro&s;&s;ed and put off by them, with a &s;mall number of per&s;ons, who contra|ry to all rea&s;on and order of gouernement, neg|lecting their vocation, outwardly made the iu&s;t la|bour of the &s;aid <HI>States</HI> vnfruitfull: but now neuer|thele&s;&s;e that by the goodne&s;&s;e of God, and the mo&s;t wi&s;e and re&s;olute conduction and dexterity of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> they haue a&s;&s;ured their tem|porall &s;tate from pre&s;ent danger, they thought it not conuenient to neglect the care which they ought to haue of the Spirituall: To the which end, the <HI>Sinode</HI> was freely opened, and began to be hol|den in the Moneth of <HI>Nouember</HI> la&s;t, as they de&s;i|red, with this onely pre&s;cription and clau&s;e, not to &s;eeke any other thing thereby, then the honour of God, and the peace of mens con&s;ciences, in the pu|ritie of his word, wherein there is found and a&s;&s;em|bled &s;o great a number of excellent per&s;ons, both for pietie and vprightne&s;&s;e, cho&s;en and appointed thereunto by their &s;uperiours, that the <HI>States</HI> haue good cau&s;e to hope well of their labours; and that al&s;o, by Gods holy grace, the euent will te&s;tifie their iu&s;t and &s;incere intentions, to the content|ment
<PB REF="8">of his Maie&s;tie, the good and peace of their common-wealth, and the confu&s;ion of the authors of this faction.</P>
<P>Further the &s;aid State al&s;o e&s;teeme, weigh, and thinke very well of the rea&s;ons and con&s;iderati|ons formerly &s;et downe by the &s;aid Lords Amba&s;|&s;adours, in fauour of the Pri&s;oners, to admini&s;ter vnto them good and &s;peedie Iu&s;tice, and to v&s;e them fauourably, if they haue not con&s;pired the ruine of their State, with their enemyes: but for that the &s;aid <HI>States</HI> haue beene continually bu&s;ied about &s;etling the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecuritie of their com|mon-wealth, which had been greatly &s;haken by the violent proceedings of &s;uch as a&s;pired to nouelties, by alteration of Religion, Iu&s;tice, and fundamen|tall Lawes of all polliticke orders: and that other|wi&s;e this con&s;piracie grew &s;o great, that nothing was exempted from the infection thereof, they thought it not conuenient to run headlong vpon &s;uch a proce&s;&s;e of &s;o great importance, &amp; that fir&s;t it was mo&s;t fit &s;euerally to gather and collect all &s;uch euidences as might tend vnto, and concerne the &s;ame, for their full in&s;truction therein, clearely to make knowne and manife&s;t the grounds and depth of the cau&s;e, and that &s;uch delay could not be any wayes hurtfull or preiudiciall to the Cri|minells, if they pre&s;umed to haue any aduantage to iu&s;tifie their innocency. Notwith&s;tanding, there hath not therein bin any lo&s;&s;e of time, but things haue bin done orderly and diligently, &amp; haue alrea|dy proceeded &s;o farre, that they are per&s;waded that iudgement &s;hall not long be deferred, and &s;uch without doubt, that at the publication thereof, all
<PB REF="8">their allies, which affect the pro&s;perity of this State, and &s;pecially his Maie&s;tie, who is a iu&s;t and vertu|ous Prince, will commend their vpright dealing, when they &s;hall be better informed of the &s;tate of the con&s;piracie.</P>
<P>In the meane time, they de&s;ire the &s;aid Lords <HI>Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure his <HI>Maie&s;tie</HI> from them, that they will encline them&s;elues &s;o much to clemencie and fauour (wherevnto they, and the condition of their gouernment are naturally addicted) as equi|tie, iu&s;tice, and the pre&s;eruation of their State, may in any wi&s;e permit them: Hoping that his <HI>Maie&s;tie</HI> (in regard of the cau&s;e) will not be per&s;waded to prefer the important and ill-grounded &s;olicitations of certaine particular criminels, or of their fauou|rites, before the generall intere&s;t of the dignitie and worthines of this Common-wealth; but to the con|trary per&s;wade them&s;elues that his <HI>Maie&s;tie</HI> will finde it more expedient for his &s;eruice, &amp; the good of the &s;aid Prouinces, to referre the &s;ame to the &s;aid <HI>States</HI> gouernment and iudgement, which they will take paines to conclude and fini&s;h, with &s;o much equitie and clemencie among them&s;elues, that the obedience of their &s;ubiects &s;hall by their authority be confirmed, and with &s;o great wi&s;dome &amp; re&s;pect of their allies, that his Maie&s;tie &s;hall haue occa&s;ion to content him&s;elfe with the duty which they will &s;hew for the ob&s;eruation and maintaining of his alliance with them, whereof they will truly yeeld him &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>_IT is true, and a common &s;ay|ing, my Lord, that tho&s;e which v&s;e to play, before they begin, &s;hould be &s;ure to make a good match: it is the &s;ame adui&s;e which you your &s;elfe gaue to a turbulent &s;pirit, that &s;ought the di&s;quietne&s;&s;e and ruine of <HI>France:</HI> an adui&s;e which you &s;ugge&s;ted to be conuenient, by the knowledge that you had, that tho&s;e who &s;eeke to &s;et vpon and con&s;pire again&s;t their King, in the end come by the lo&s;&s;e, I meane both of honour and life: And neuerthele&s;&s;e for|getting your owne in&s;tructions, and the examples which time hath produced; you are now fallen in|to the &s;ame crymes, which formerly you abhor|red, and thereby become di&s;obedient and rebelli|ous: Crimes, &s;o much the more to be blamed, as they are committed by a per&s;on, who not onely ought to &s;hun them, but to the contrary, is oblie|ged and bound by all manner of duties, to imploy both his body and goods again&s;t tho&s;e that enter|pri&s;e
<PB REF="10">them. I am &s;o much grieued at your procee|dings, that it moueth me boldly without difficul|ty to tell you, (being culpable as you are) that my adui&s;e is, and in&s;tantly I be&s;eech you, to &s;eeke out meanes to cure your malady, and to procure your owne &s;afety, and therein to take my coun&s;ell, haue|ing heretofore giuen you warning of your former actions, at the lea&s;t, I &s;hall di&s;charge my &s;elfe of the duety which I owe vnto you, for the fauours I haue receiued at your hands, and I call heauen to witne&s;&s;e of my &s;incerity; let me then intreat you, to peru&s;e the&s;e few lines, and &s;uffer the truth therein by me &s;et downe, to worke &s;ome remor&s;e of con&s;cience in you. Vpon what doe you thinke, I be&s;eech you, when you di&s;charge your arrowes again&s;t the Kings Maie&s;ty, and the peace of his e&s;tate? you that haue both the grace and honour to be one of the officers of his crowne, and haue as much charge and commoditie as any other a|bout him? This is not the way, by waxing elder, to grow wi&s;er, but rather to counterfeit the Ape, which the older it groweth, the vnhappier it is. What? in a manner hauing one foote already in the graue, to damne his owne &s;oule, and di&s;obay the King? and not onely to di&s;obay him, but to offend him, in the deare&s;t thing that he hath, and not onely to offend him therein, but to take vpon you to rai&s;e his Subiects to beare armes again&s;t him vnder light pretences, as the truth well &s;heweth; I neither know, nor can conceiue, how a man e&s;tee|med to be wi&s;e, who&s;e beard is gray, and &s;eemeth to be of a &s;tayed iudgement, &s;hould fall into &s;o great
<PB REF="10">folly; pardon me for &s;peaking &s;o freely: A Can|ker mu&s;t be lanched and cut away, your euill is no le&s;&s;e, and mo&s;t dangerous. You are not ignorant, that Kings are the images of the liuing God, that their wils and commandements are Lawes to be &s;pecially ob&s;erued, and that no man can di&s;pen&s;e therewith, without being guilty of high trea&s;on, both diuine and humane, and yet, you haue not onely ventred to di&s;obey them, but al&s;o by a man|ner of new interpretation, haue directly with&s;tood his commandements. The King thought your per&s;onall pre&s;ence to be nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Metz,</HI> and you thought the contrary, and that your abode there would not like you, though you were appointed thereunto; his Maie&s;tie de&s;ired your &s;eruice in tho&s;e parts, and you would perferre certaine par|ticular affaires, to &s;atisfie your owne plea&s;ures and inclinations, as if we were at the Romaines Sa|turnals.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t grant mee this, that there are no examples for your proceedings, and that if in times pa&s;t, there were rebels and di&s;obedient Subiects, they alwaies &s;ought to di&s;&s;emble, and to couer and hide their pretences with nece&s;&s;ity: you v&s;e not any &s;uch meanes, but are rather more hardned, &amp; &s;eeme directly and openly to oppo&s;e your &s;elfe again&s;t his Maie&s;tie: What puni&s;hment thinke you doth &s;uch a crime de&s;erue? One fault willingly and mo&s;t commonly draweth on another. What haue you done &s;ince you came from <HI>Metz?</HI> You haue borne away the Kings Mother, and carried her to <HI>An|gouli&s;me,</HI>
<PB REF="11">where you &s;pread the en&s;ignes of reuolt, and there determine vpon warre, and the &s;ubuer|&s;ion of the State? What audaciou&s;ne&s;&s;e is this, and whatan enterpri&s;e haue you vndertaken, to circum|uent the intents of a good Mother, towards her deare Sonne; to trouble and &s;et at variance the harmony and con&s;ent of their wils; to &s;hake, and as it were to breake the bond of nature, and vio|lently to pull out of &s;o great a Princes bre&s;t, the loue which &s;he oweth to her Sonne, to her King, and to him that &s;pecially loueth her? Mi&s;erable man, (if I mu&s;t needes v&s;e this tearme) what is your pretence? To ruinate his Maie&s;ties affaires, and to ouerthrow and &s;ubuert the publique peace of the Land? It is the conceit of a franticke braine, go|uerned by the author of malice: Doe you not think and per&s;wade your &s;elfe, that rea&s;on once taking place, but that the Queene will condemne your pernicious de&s;ignes, and the proceedings that you haue cau&s;ed her to v&s;e? there is no doubt there|of, your forces cannot altogether breake and di&s;&s;i|pate the principall motions of her &s;ugge&s;tions, which are Nature and the feare of God, able and &s;ufficient to driue away the clouds and fictions wherewith you &s;erue your turne: The common people, manife&s;tly &s;ee it, and cur&s;e you, as often as they behold and looke into the euils which you bring vpon them: They know that his Maie&s;tie is a mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Prince, that he loueth his Mo|ther perfectly well, and that he neuer gaue any iu&s;t cau&s;e to procure this eua&s;ion: They are a&s;&s;ured
<PB REF="11">and otherwi&s;e comforted, that this &s;eparation can|not continue long: Their mutuall de&s;ire already is to &s;ee one another, and to &s;hew the effects of their reciprocall loues: Expect not then to fortifie the weakene&s;&s;e of your cau&s;e, by the detention of the Queenes per&s;on; you &s;hall neuer haue the con|&s;ent of her heart and will, to the ruine of the State, and her owne glory.</P>
<P>But this is not all, I mu&s;t begin againe, and leade you to the execution of that which this burning feuer enduceth in your fanta&s;ie. You haue di&s;o|bayed, &amp; allienated (as you pretend) the Queenes intents, you mu&s;t now blame the gouernement both within and without the Realme, and in all places proclaime warre, and the de&s;olation of your Countrey; wherein &s;pecially your de&s;igne cannot take effect. Forraigne Princes honour, &amp; too much de&s;ire the amity and alliance of our Monarch; they haue &s;eene miracles, as it were, in his actions, and that in his young yeares, with a manly and re&s;o|lute genero&s;itie, he hath danted the mon&s;ters of his Realme, and by an admirable care and wi&s;edome, procured peace to tho&s;e that had warre; which is the cau&s;e, that by a generall con&s;ent they giue him the glorious title of the <HI>Arbitrator of Chri&s;tendome;</HI> and his amity is &s;o de&s;irable and profitable, that &s;uch as are admitted thereunto (how farre di&s;tant &s;oeuer they be) &s;leepe and take their re&s;ts, without any apprehen&s;ion of trouble; how then will they vnder&s;tand your clamours, vnle&s;&s;e it be to blame and condemne them?</P>
<PB REF="12">
<P>The peace that we enioy, is an euident te&s;timo|ny of the piety, iu&s;tice, and prouidence of our King; and therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible that your in|uentions &s;hould de&s;troy the truth, and that which we &s;ee with our owne eyes, in &s;uch manner, that if in long time, there hath beene a happy raigne in <HI>France,</HI> it is now at this pre&s;ent, where all Orders and degrees are &s;eene to flouri&s;h; Vertue therein is commended, and Pietie (the true &s;upport of the State) particularly adored, where our King is as it were, a perfect modell; Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per&s;ons are reuerenced, and called to coun&s;ell in his Maie|&s;ties mo&s;t important affaires, they enioy and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e their reuenewes without trouble; the Nobi|lity are loued and re&s;pected; Iu&s;tice is indifferent|ly and without feare executed; the Commons are not oppre&s;&s;ed nor charged with Sub&s;idies or new impo&s;itions; and all e&s;tates together, haue nothing &s;o much in recommendation, nor &s;o deare, as this good King, for who&s;e health and pro&s;perity they daily make their feruent prayers vnto God. How then &s;hould they be moued to offence? and that to accommodate your humours, they &s;hould &s;et fire on their hou&s;es, and ruinate and &s;poile one the other, after that to expect nothing el&s;e but mi&s;ery in this life, and damnation in the life to come?</P>
<P>I know a&s;&s;uredly, that you &s;pecially build your de&s;ignes vpon the incon&s;tancy of the popularity, as if the con&s;ideration of your per&s;on, or of any others, were of more importance vnto them, then
<PB REF="12">the Kings, and their owne pre&s;eruation: There|in you are deceiued; the loue and obedience that they beare and owe vnto him, are by Gods owne finger ingrauen in their hearts, with a caracter im|po&s;&s;ible to be defaced, and your name is execra|ble, as the &s;worne enemy of their good: they openly report and &s;ay, that it is impo&s;&s;ible that he which is wicked &amp; cruell again&s;t his own children, &s;hould euer be good to others; that he which &s;ee|keth the ruine &amp; &s;ubuer&s;ion of his natiue Country, vnworthy of humaine &s;ociety: that the poy&s;on of your venemous heart hath long time appeared, and that it ought and &s;hould be choaked in the birth; that the &s;pots and vncleanene&s;&s;e of your &s;oule, and the coun&s;els which your actions haue impo&s;ed vpon it, makes you play the la&s;t act of your Tragedy. To conclude and be &s;hort, they are willing to contribute and giue fire and fagot to con&s;ume the author of &s;o many mi&s;chiefes. I di&s;|&s;cribe all the&s;e circum&s;tances vnto you without flattery, to let you &s;ee the &s;tate wherevnto your affaires are reduced.</P>
<P>Tell me now, who hath brought you to the&s;e extreamities? Is it the di&s;contentment of the Queene? &s;he had no other but that onely which you haue procured; and &s;ay that &s;he had, doth it belong to you to intermeddle with the difference that is between Princes? It is not like that of yours: The Sonne and the Mother would &s;oone haue a|greed together, and good endeauour would haue reduced all things to their true ends: Therein you
<PB REF="13">are two-fold culpable; one by &s;hewing your e|uill will; the other by &s;eeking to &s;et diui&s;ion be|tweene the Sonne and the Mother, the Subiect and the King, and a loue which could not be broken, but by the impiteous windes of your &s;i|ni&s;ter coun&s;els.</P>
<P>It may be, ye will alleadge that you are none of his Maie&s;ties priuie-Coun&s;ellours, and your honour is &s;uch that you would know all, that you may enterpri&s;e much; let vs rea&s;on boldly: The coun&s;ell which the King now hath, is the &s;ame that his Father had, who by his valorous actions, and wi&s;e conduction, was called the <HI>wonder of Kings:</HI> That great King, made profit of mens actions, and perfectly vnder&s;tood the mindes of his &s;ubiects, and yet he neuer-made you priuie to the coun&s;ell of his mo&s;t important affaires: He was content to doe you good, and to continue you in the Offices that you enioyed; mu&s;t you then complaine, that the King his &s;onne, and &s;ucce&s;&s;our in his vertues, followeth the &s;ame cour&s;e and coun&s;ell, by the ayde and dexterity whereof, he had giuen vs a ge|nerall peace, and almo&s;t a golden world? Beleeue mee, rather prai&s;e and commend that good King, who in a manner had buried in obliuion the me|morie of that which you know, and which I dare not touch, fearing to offend his indul|gence: I leaue it to the regi&s;ters of the Court of <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>Is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be di&s;contented, that his <HI>Maie&s;ty</HI> affecteth, and doth good to &s;ome
<PB REF="13">one of his Seruitors, more then to you. I thinke you are not at that point; for what other &s;hould that then be, but to &s;hew your &s;elfe vnthankefull for, and to condemne that which <HI>Henry</HI> the third did for you? He loued you mo&s;t particularly, and gaue you all that you enioy, be&s;ides 8000. Franks yearely reuenews. This your great fortune, was much enuyed, and many men &s;pake thereof, to your preiudice, which rea&s;on denyed: I remem|ber that &s;ome in re&s;pect of you &s;aid, that men in Kings hands, are like vnto Counters which they make to value as much as they thinke good: And that there was neuer any Monarch, but that &s;hew|ed &s;ome proofes of particular affections, which in truth are Royall actions, worthy of commen|dation. And it is no &s;mall good, to a great Prince, to make a good choy&s;e of, and to haue faithfull &s;eruitors about him, with &s;ecuritie and famili|arity, to whom hee may di&s;couer and di&s;clo&s;e his heart, and thoughts: Euery one of vs &s;ee it by experience, and finde nothing more plea&s;ing and acceptable, then to impart and vnfold our affaires vnto, and with tho&s;e who&s;e affections and amities are well knowne vnto vs. Our King loueth with great iudgement, hee knoweth and will acknow|ledge the merit and fidelitie wherewith he hath bin &s;erued; I meane, the more he (&s;pecially) whom he loueth, hath amiable quallities and worthy the e&s;ti|mation of a King. I will not particularize them, nor proceed further in this &s;ubiect, only I will &s;ay, that we mu&s;t hold all that for Law, which plea&s;eth the
<PB REF="14">Prince, and that for their &s;ake, we mu&s;t loue tho&s;e whom they loue, much le&s;&s;e ought wee to enuye and hate them: It &s;hould in truth be a mo&s;t hard thing, and without all likelihood or apparance of rea&s;on for Subiects to impo&s;e lawes to their &s;oue|raignes, and to ma&s;ter their plea&s;ures and affecti|ons, they them&s;elues being free in their owne particular hou&s;es, to loue and to doe good to tho&s;e to whom they will; and I &s;ay further, that the fauour and fortune whereof wee &s;peake, alte|reth not that which is due vnto Princes, neither yet abateth any thing of the aduantage and e&s;ti|mation of the Nobilitie, nor v&s;eth any violence or euill entertainement towards others, whereby we may truly &s;ay, that no man can nor may di&s;like or contradict it, but onely of meere enuy, the &s;worne enimy of all good actions, and of the aduancement and greatne&s;&s;e of vertuous men.</P>
<P>This is the Table or Portraiture which I thought good to &s;et before your eyes, without di&s;&s;imulation, to let you &s;ee the greatne&s;&s;e of your faults, and the extreamity whereinto you are falne. It may be you will be grieued that I di&s;play them &s;o openly; I prote&s;t that I haue not &s;et them all downe, and that without doing wrong to you, and to mine owne intent, I could not &s;ay le&s;&s;e. My pur|po&s;e is herein to &s;et downe &s;ufficient to per&s;wade you to the truth, and to &s;earch the wound to the bottome, to the end, that hauing any feeling, you your &s;elfe may &s;eeke how to heale it; you &s;hould doe it while time &s;erueth: This is the aduice which
<PB REF="14">I will giue you. A Lampe goeth out if you put too much moy&s;ture vnto it; acknowledge that your too great e&s;tate hath reduced you to this point of great lo&s;&s;e, and not yours onely, but your chil|drens, whom you cruelly drew into your rebelli|ons. Kings haue Iron armes; for Gods &s;ake &s;tay not till our King lifts vp his, you will &s;urely be bro|ken in pieces with the blow; preuent it by humili|ty, certainely his <HI>Mate&s;ty</HI> is iu&s;t and benigne; hee puni&s;heth and exterminateth ob&s;tinate Rebells, but he pardoneth tho&s;e that aske mercy and for|giuene&s;&s;e. It is the onely hauen wherein you &s;hall finde hope of reliefe, refer your &s;elfe with a good heart freely vnto his bounty, and you &s;hall not be deceiued in your expectation.</P>
<P>Suffer the Queene to be at libertie to revnite and ioyne her affections with her Sonnes; let your children be &s;uerties and pledges of your libertie, let them fall downe at his <HI>Maie&s;ties</HI> feete, to prote&s;t and warrant your amendment, and your mo&s;t humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to full fill all obedience in time to come: Di&s;charge your Souldiers, and let euery place &s;ound the prai&s;e of &s;o compleat a Prince, and your re&s;olution to die in his &s;eruice. I am with|out doubt per&s;waded, that this proceeding will be acceptable vnto him, and that following the example of <HI>Henry</HI> the great, his father, he will im|brace and pre&s;erue you. What glory (my Lord) will it be vnto you to haue appea&s;ed the wrath of &s;o pui&s;&s;ant a Prince? To haue of your &s;elfe reob|tained his fauour? To haue pacified the tumult
<PB REF="15">which you had rai&s;ed in his Realme? To haue procured peace to your owne &s;oule, and re&s;t vn|to your late&s;t daies, and to haue ree&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;tate and fortunes of your Children. I be|&s;eech God gine you grace earne&s;tly to thinke vpon the&s;e things, and to put them in effect: I de&s;ire and wi&s;h it more then any other, that I may &s;ee you re&s;tored, and haue the meanes hereafter to &s;ay, as I haue hether done that I re&s;t</P>
