<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THough occa&s;ion has not hitherto per|mitted me to write to you all this time, yet I hope this will not be unwelcome to &s;uch a well-wi&s;her of their Maje&s;ties and Countreys Intere&s;t as your &s;elf. We ju&s;t now Arrived here &s;afe from <HI>Dublin</HI> Bay, whither our Comman|der Captain <HI>John Jennings</HI> was ordered out la&s;t Week, taking Their Maje&s;ties Ship the <HI>Dover,</HI> Captain <HI>Whitaker</HI> Commander a|long for our A&s;&s;i&s;tance: we Arrived at <HI>Dub|lin</HI> Bay about 11 at Night on <HI>Friday</HI> la&s;t, and came to an Anchor, &s;ent our Boats to and a|gain over the Bay all that Night and to Mor|row after, and did take &s;everal little Ve&s;&s;els with Pri&s;oners, and Prote&s;tants, by whom we were too late informed that four Ve&s;&s;els went richly loaded for <HI>France</HI> &s;ome five or &s;ix hours before we Arrived; but our com|fort is that the <HI>Ruby</HI> and <HI>James</HI> Galley being &s;ent before us to Crui&s;e over again&s;t <HI>Water|ford</HI> and <HI>Salte&s;s,</HI> can hardly be &s;uppo&s;ed to mi&s;s of them. Our taking of &s;o many of their Barks and Ve&s;&s;els did &s;o vex the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that they planted abundance of Great Guns upon one &s;ide of the Bay, and play'd very &s;martly upon us all <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, which our Men were &s;o unconcerned at, that while their Great Shot came very thick about us on all &s;ides, yet all we returned them for &s;ome time were &s;ome few Hollows of deri|&s;ion after every Volley of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Guns. But at length our Commander orders to weigh Anchor, and coming &s;ome nearer to them, returned them &s;o hot Broad-&s;ides that though all the place was full of Men, and convenience to keep our Shot from doing them much hurt, yet of a truth it was plea|&s;ant to &s;ee with what pannick fear and con|fu&s;ion they run every one almo&s;t a different way, in all the World like a company of Mice pur&s;ued by Rats, indu&s;triou&s;ly making tryal of every appearance of a hiding place. The Hor&s;es run as confu&s;edly and di&s;orderly as the Men, and being madded with noi&s;e and di&s;order, trod down numbers of them, for though there were a great number of Hor&s;e|men (for they feared our coming a&s;hore) yet in a little time not a Man was to be &s;een on Hor&s;eback &s;ave the late King <HI>James</HI> en|deavouring to put courage in that Spiritle&s;s Crew; but all he could do was with great difficulty to get their Guns carried off, and was forced to quit his Hor&s;e; upon which our Commander ordered the Boats a&s;hore, and going him&s;elf in Per&s;on, took a little Ve&s;&s;el in the eye of &s;everal Troops of <HI>Dra|goons</HI> that had come fre&s;h from <HI>Dublin,</HI> with whom, as we under&s;tood after, the late King <HI>James</HI> returned; but &s;o &s;oon as our Commander ordered the two Boats
<PB REF="2">Crews a&s;hore, it was plea&s;ant to &s;ee how &s;uch as were on Hor&s;eback did Scamper, and &s;uch as were on Foot did climb upon the Rocks like &s;o many Goats. In fine, it not being &s;afe for &s;o &s;mall a Number as our Boats Crews to advance far, our Comman|der was contented to bring &s;ome of their Hor&s;es on Board of our Ship by the little Ve&s;&s;el he had taken in their eye, for a token of their Cowardize, and the Engli&s;h Cou|rage, among&s;t which was the late King <HI>James</HI>'s own Hor&s;e, which he had quit, it &s;eems, to order and encourage the Dragoons that were on foot. We brought four of the Hor&s;es, and &s;pecially that which was the late King <HI>James</HI>'s to <HI>High-lake,</HI> and &s;et them on Shore. In all the Action, though they lo&s;t &s;everal, as we could vi&s;ibly &s;ee, and Pri&s;oners after taken confirmed, yet we lo&s;t not one Man, though yet there wanted not work for your <HI>In&s;truments,</HI> which an&s;wered my expectation pretty well. There lay a Pri|vateer within the Bar, which we are infor|med does carry Weekly Pacquets to and from &s;ome place of <HI>England,</HI> which we could not come at, our Boats being of too &s;mall Force to attack him, and our Ships of too great Burthen to go over the Bar; be&s;ide, that we was not allowed &s;o much time by our Orders as to Man and Fit one or two of the Barks we took to attack him, el&s;e our Commander had certainly brought him a|long. The Prote&s;tants and Pri&s;oners tell us, That all things are &s;o &s;carce at <HI>Dublin,</HI> that the <HI>French</HI> are like to eat up the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and they irritated to &s;ee the <HI>French</HI> pre|ferred and countenanced, &s;everals &s;pecially of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are daily killed upon the Score. They expected we were to lye in the Bay to hinder them from any commerce by Sea with <HI>France</HI> or other parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> which terrified, and as the Prote&s;tants a&s;&s;ure us, would weaken them exceedingly, and make them quit <HI>Dublin.</HI> 'Tis commonly judged by Papi&s;ts as well as Prote&s;tants at <HI>Dublin,</HI> that King <HI>James</HI> has a mind to &s;ub|mit to our King; Fir&s;t, Becau&s;e he is no|thing &s;o much ca&s;t down, &s;ometime &s;ince he heard of King <HI>William</HI>'s De&s;ign of com|ing to <HI>Ireland;</HI> and of his little concern how things go with his Army. Others judge that he makes his account to quit <HI>Ireland</HI> at la&s;t, becau&s;e he is &s;o earne&s;t in &s;ending off for <HI>France</HI> all the Be&s;t things he can, and tho&s;e al&s;o that are near|e&s;t to him, in the&s;e four Ships I &s;poke of; they tell us of a va&s;t deal of Plate, Gold, and Silver Money, be&s;ide other fine Things; &s;o that hardly any Money but their new Coin is to be &s;een among them. We brought off a great deal of their Coin at this and other Occa&s;ions, whereof I would have &s;ent you a Token, if wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">h the pains. Our Army, as the Pri&s;oners tell us, have taken <HI>Droghedah,</HI> and make ha&s;te towards <HI>Dublin.</HI> All the Pri&s;oners profe&s;s them&s;elves willing and glad to be Taken from the Mi&s;ery that they feared to come upon them. By which you may judge what may be expected if our King were once over. So &s;oon as he goes o|ver, our Ship, with the <HI>Monk</HI> and St. <HI>Al|bans</HI> are order'd to attend the great Fleet, whence I may have Occa&s;ion to &s;end to you for &s;ome <HI>In&s;truments,</HI> and my Friends Mr. <HI>Hul&s;e</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thowlt,</HI> for &s;ome <HI>Me|dicines;</HI> for our Captain has &s;poken to me to provide for a bigger Ship. I &s;hall only de&s;ire you to Pre&s;ent my mo&s;t hearty Re&s;pects to my very good Friends Mr. <HI>Hargrave,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Couley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hul&s;e,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thowlt;</HI> and to plea&s;e, if you can hear of us, to write me how they be, and your &s;elf; as al&s;o how things Rule, e&s;pecially in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Our Crui|&s;ers have been &s;o vigilant, that it is great News to hear of a <HI>French</HI> Ship a|ny where in this Channel. I could write you many more con&s;iderable things, but that I forbear to trouble you too much at one time, being,</P>
