<P><HI>_OF making many books there is no end,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;. 12.10.</NOTE> &s;aid the wi&s;e King, many ages pa&s;t; yet for &s;ome arts and fa|culties, I &s;uppo&s;e (even in this printing age of ours) we may complain of &s;carcitie. For among &s;o many au|thors ancient and modern, which have written of the Art Militarie, is it not &s;trange that hardly any hath fully handled that which concerneth the Cavallrie? Among the ancients, <HI>Aelian</HI> hath &s;omewhat touched upon the manner of ordering the hor&s;e, among the Grecians; and <HI>Vegetius</HI> (where he &s;peaketh of the Romane Cavallrie) lightly pa&s;&s;eth it over, and concludeth in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 3. <HI>cap.</HI> 26.</NOTE> the&s;e words, <HI>De equitatu &s;unt multa praecepta: &s;ed c&ugrave;m haec pars militiae u&s;u exercitii, armorum genere, &amp; equorum nobilitate profecerit, ex libris nihil arbitror colligendum, c&ugrave;m prae&s;ens doctrina &s;uffici|at.</HI> Now the rea&s;on why they (be&s;towing their chief labour about the Infan|terie) left &s;o little direction for the hor&s;e, may be, either becau&s;e that (both with Grecians and Romanes) the<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">Magis reipublicae ne|ce&s;&s;arii pedites; qui po&s;|&s;unt ubique prode&s;&s;e. <HI>Veg. lib. 2. cap. 1.</HI></NOTE> foot were of greate&s;t e&s;teem (as that wherein their chief strength con&s;i&s;ted, and whereon they principally relyed) &amp; &s;o the le&s;&s;e regard was had of the hor&s;e; or el&s;e becau&s;e the &s;ervice of hor&s;e was not<NOTE N="c" PLACE="marg">Eque&s;tris Romaneram militia imperfecta fuit, unde no&s;tra jure potior exi&s;timanda e&s;t. <HI>Scipio Amiratus, Di&s;&s;ert: po|lit. lib. 19.</HI></NOTE> grown to that perfection in tho&s;e times, which it &s;ince attain|ed. For what great effect could be expected of hor&s;e u&s;ing no<NOTE N="d" PLACE="marg">When they were to charge the enemie, they u&s;ed to pull off their bridles <HI>T.

But for modern authors there is not the like rea&s;on: and yet of &s;o many as have written, none have treated of rules and in&s;tructions for the Cavall|rie, untill lately <HI>George Ba&s;ta,</HI> Count of the holy Empire, and <HI>Luys Mel|zo</HI> knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> wrote their books of Cavallrie.

But the&s;e and the like being written in the forrain lan|guages, and among &s;o many of our militarie pamphlets none treating of Ca|vallrie; I have adventured (though altogether unfit for &s;uch a task) to employ &s;ome idle houres in the diligent reading, and conferring of the &s;aid authors to|gether with &s;uch other books and informations as I could obtain out of the Low-countreys and other places, for my better &s;atisfaction herein:<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">Lapides &amp; ligna ab aliis accipio, adificii tamen extructio &amp; forma, no|&s;tra.

For what is there in the&s;e modern warres, which is not borrowed from antiquitie? wherein we follow them &s;tep by &s;tep (<HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> the later inventions of fire weapons, and the u&s;e and dependencie there of onely excepted) not onely in their manner, but even retaining their very words of command; as in this treati&s;e is partly &s;hewed, and would be more manife&s;tly apparent if the &s;ubject were Infanterie; which no way di&s;parageth the modern practi&s;e, but rather (for the antiquitie of it) gives it the more re&s;pect and e&s;timation.</P>
<P>Now, le&s;t the <HI>Tyro</HI> or untutored hor&s;eman &s;hould be deterred, and &s;hould judge his task to be overgreat; I have &s;et down a table of the chapters, that &s;o he may apply him&s;elf, onely to tho&s;e things (at fir&s;t) which are princi|pally nece&s;&s;arie for him to know and practi&s;e.</P>

<P>_FOr the reforming of the Cavallrie, there is more|over required a &s;ingular care, that the compa|nies be &s;upplied with good hor&s;es: wherefore it will be nece&s;&s;arie, that when the Cavallrie is retired from the field, the Captains make &s;ale of &s;uch hor&s;es as be unfit for &s;ervice, and buy better. When the com|panies be entered into garri&s;on, the &s;ouldiers which are on foot mu&s;t pre&s;ently be remounted; that &s;o, in the time of winter, they may at lei&s;ure fit their hor&s;es for &s;ervice: for be|ing only remounted at the time of their going into the field, the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Equos a&s;&s;uluo labore convenit edomari.</HI> Veg. lib. 2. cap. 14.</NOTE> hor&s;es are not fitted for &s;ervice, and being yong and not u&s;ed to the bridle, by any little toile they become un|profitable: be&s;ides, when a man is put (on the &s;uddain) to buy &s;uch as he findeth, they prove not onely the wor&s;er, but the dearer. Moreover, tho&s;e &s;ouldiers which want hor&s;es are of no &s;ervice; and the&s;e are they (u&s;ually) which &s;traggle disbanded, and do mo&s;t mi&s;chief about the quarters. And becau&s;e oftentimes there is not money a&s;&s;igned apart to re|mount the &s;ouldiers, it were good that among the compa|nies there were a brother-hood or fellow&s;hip erected,
<PB N="25" REF="17"> (which the Spani&s;h call <HI>Platta</HI>) which con&s;i&s;teth in making a ca&s;h, wherein the money which is gathered to that end, is kept; as followeth.

To rai&s;e this ca&s;h, the Captain mu&s;t give order, that a crown be defalked out of every &s;ouldiers fir&s;t pay, foure realls out of a third of pay, and eight out of the contributions of a moneth: or el&s;e this proporti|on to be for the fir&s;t beginning, and afterwards the moytie; or more or le&s;&s;e as need &s;hall require.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVII. Of exerci&s;e in particular.</HI> Of managing of the hor&s;e and arms.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Cavallrie being to be exerci&s;ed, mu&s;t be in|&s;tructed how to manage their hor&s;e and their arms.</P>
<P>Concerning the hor&s;e (pre&s;uppo&s;ing him to be of &s;ufficient &s;tature and &s;trength, nimble of joynts, and &s;ure of foot &amp;c.) he mu&s;t (of nece&s;&s;itie) be made fit for &s;ervice, &s;o as you may have him ready at command to pace, trot, gallop, or runne in full careere; al&s;o to advance, &s;top, retire, and turn readily to either hand, and all with alacritie and obedi|ence. Now, to bring him to this readie turning, he is to be ridden the ring, and figure 8, fir&s;t in a great compa&s;&s;e, and &s;o in a le&s;&s;e by degrees; fir&s;t upon his pace, then on the trot, and &s;o to the gallop and careere. The&s;e things he may be taught by u&s;ing the hand, leg and voice. For the hand (ob|&s;erving not to move the arm, but onely the wri&s;t) if you would have him to face to the left, a little motion of the little finger on that rein, and a touch of the left leg) with|out
<PB N="35" REF="23"> u&s;ing the &s;purre) doth it: if to face (or turn) to the left a|bout, a harder, &amp;c. If you would have him to trot, you are to move both your legges a little forward; for the gallop, to move them more forward, and for the careere to yerk them mo&s;t forward, and to move the bodie a little forward with it. After every motion performed, it were good to keep him a while in that motion, as when you bid him &s;tand, to &s;tand a while, &amp;c. Al&s;o it were not ami&s;&s;e, after every thing well done, to give him &s;ome bread or gra&s;&s;e as a reward. For the voice, you may u&s;e the vvords, Advance, hold, turn, or the like, but becau&s;e the voice cannot alwayes be heard, it were good to u&s;e him chiefly to the motions of the hand and leg. It will al&s;o be very u&s;efull to teach him to go &s;idewayes: this he may be brought unto by laying his provender &s;omewhat farre from him in the manger, and keeping him from turning his head towards it. He mu&s;t al&s;o be u&s;ed to the &s;mell of gunpowder, the &s;ight of fire and armour, and the hearing of &s;hot, drummes and trumpets, &amp;c. but by degrees and vvith di&s;cretion. When he is at his oats (at a good di&s;tance from him) a little povvder may be fired, and &s;o nearer to him by degrees. So may a pi&s;toll be fired &s;ome di&s;tance off, and &s;o nearer: in like manner a drumme or trumpet may be u&s;ed. The groom may &s;ometime dre&s;&s;e him in armour, and he may be u&s;ed (novv and then) to eat his oats from the drumme head. It vvill be very u&s;efull &s;ome|time to cau&s;e a musketier to &s;tand at a convenient di&s;tance, and both of you to give fire upon each other, and thereupon to ride up clo&s;e to him: al&s;o to ride him again&s;t a compleat armour, &s;o &s;et upon a &s;take, that he may overthrovv it, and trample it under his feet: that &s;o (and by &s;uch other means) your hor&s;e (finding that he receiveth no hurt) may become bold to approach any object. He may al&s;o be u&s;ed to moun|tanous and uneven vvayes, and be exerci&s;ed to leap, &s;vvimme, and the like. But for further directions for the art of riding and managing the hor&s;e, I referre the reader to<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Be&s;ides many of our owne writers; <HI>Pierre de la No&uuml;e</HI> in his Cavallerie Fran|choi&s;e et Italienne. <HI>al&s;o</HI> In&s;truction du Roy (de France) en l'exercice de mon|ter a Cheval, par Antoyne de Plubi|nel. lately publi&s;hed, and divers others.</NOTE> them vvhich have vvritten of hor&s;e-man&s;hip <HI>ex profe&s;so,</HI> vvho&s;e books are every vvhere obvious.</P>

<P>The manner of carrying the lance, is either advanced, or couched, that is, when it is carried &s;o aba&s;ed, as the enemie can hardly di&s;cover it untill he feel the &s;hock.</P>
<P>The charging of the lance is twofold, either by the right, or left.</P>
<P>The right is, when it is pre&s;ented or charged along by the right &s;ide of the hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The left is, when it is born acro&s;&s;e the neck of the hor&s;e, by the left eare.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is the manner u&s;ed by the Turks and Hunga|rians, and by &s;ome preferred before the other. One rea&s;on which they give for it, is, becau&s;e that in charging by the left, the Lancier mu&s;t incline his bodie to the left, and &s;o &s;itteth the le&s;&s;e &s;ure in his &s;addle.</P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;ta</HI> would have the &s;econd way to be be&s;t. How&s;oever, all agree that a Lancier mu&s;t ever &s;trive to gain the left &s;ide of his enemie, and charge him on the left.</P>
<P>Now there be three wayes of charging; </P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1 By carrying the lance &s;loaped upwards.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2 By charging it levell, in a &s;traight line.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3 By charging it &s;loaping, or inclining downwards.</ITEM>

<P>The &s;econd is, by charging a hor&s;e-man about the middle, (to bear him out of the &s;addle) or on the brea&s;t of the foot.</P>
<P>The third &s;erveth to pierce the brea&s;t of the enemies hor&s;e, or a kneeling musketier, or pike charging at the foot again&s;t hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e three &s;everall wayes mu&s;t be diligently practi&s;ed, and require much dexteritie: to which end a &s;take is to be &s;et up, having an arm (as it were) &s;tretched out from it, and thereunto a white (either of paper or linen) fa&s;tned, at &s;eve|rall heights, which the Lancier mu&s;t exerci&s;e him&s;elf to hit in full careere; al&s;o to take up a glove (or the like) from the ground with the point of his lance, &amp;c.

Again&s;t an armed Lancier, the be&s;t way of char|ging is judged to be, not after the two fir&s;t wayes, but by the third, that is, at the brea&s;t of the hor&s;e, and that towards the left &s;ide of him, where his heart and vitals are; and for this, the charging by the right is held be&s;t.</P>
<P>Having given his charge with the lance, &s;o as it becometh unu&s;efull to him, he mu&s;t betake him&s;elf to his pi&s;toll, in the u&s;e whereof he is to be very skilfull.

<P>But the more compendious way of lading, for the gain|ing of time (which in the in&s;tant of skirmi&s;h is chiefly to be regarded) is by u&s;ing cartouches. Now, the cartouch is to be made of white paper, cut out of convenient breadth and length, and rowled upon a &s;tick, (or the rammer, if it be not too little) fit (according to the bore of the barrell) to contain a due quantitie of powder, &amp; the bullet. The proportion of powder u&s;ually required is half the weight of the bullet; but that is held too much by &s;uch as can judge. Having moul|ded the paper, the one end of it is to be turned in (to keep in the powder) and the due charge of powder to be put into it, at the other end; which powder is to be clo&s;ed in by tying a little thred about the paper: then the bullet is to be put in, and that al&s;o tyed in with a little thred. When the Cuira&s;&s;i|er is to u&s;e his cartouch, he mu&s;t bite off the paper at the head of it, and &s;o put it into the barrell of his pi&s;toll, with the bullet upward, and then ramme it home. By<NOTE N="b" PLACE="marg">For the more &s;peedy lading of the pi&s;toll, and avoiding the trouble of carrying either fla&s;que or touchbox, there is a late invented fa&s;hion of &s;panner or key, (which I have repre|&s;ented in <HI>figure</HI> 1) which contains &s;ix charges of powder (at the lea&s;t) and priming powder &s;ufficient for tho&s;e charges, &amp; for the cartouches where|with the pi&s;toll ca&s;es be furni&s;hed: which the Cuira&s;&s;ier will finde to be of very good u&s;e, when he is u&s;ed thereunto.</NOTE> this means he &s;hall much expedite the lading of his pi&s;toll.

<P>_HAving &s;hewed how every hor&s;e-man is to be exerci&s;ed in the managing of his hor&s;e, as al&s;o in the u&s;e of his particular arms; it follow|eth now that he be taught how to demean him&s;elf, being joyned in a bodie.</P>
<P>And here, before we enter into the motions, it were fit to explain the terms of<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><P>The Graecians and Romanes had the &s;ame order of exerci&s;e, and that in the &s;ame words, which we re|tain to this day.</P>

<P>Their di&s;tances were the &s;ame with us. Their 2 cubits (every cubit being a foot and an half of our mea|&s;ure) agreed with our 3 foot. Their 4 cubits, our 6 foot: and &s;o in|crea&s;ing upon occa&s;i|on. They ordered their hor&s;e-troops at 6 foot di&s;tance be|tween file and file, in march, and 3 foot in fight.</P></NOTE> art therein u&s;ed, and to &s;hew what is meant by a file, a rank, half files, and half ranks; the front, flanks, and reere, and the like. But (for brevitie &s;ake) I pa&s;&s;e them over, referring the reader to the books of Infanterie.</P>
<P>To exerci&s;e the hor&s;e, they are to be drawn up into a bo|die, not by ranks, but by files: and tho&s;e of 5 deep, as mo&s;t affirm, or of 6, as others would have it, and that becau&s;e the number of 5 is not divi&s;ible by 2, and &s;o in doubling of ranks, or half files, or the like, there is alwaies an odde rank. Some would have them (e&s;pecially the Harquebu&s;iers) to be 8 in file, taking the troop to con&s;i&s;t of 64. Being put in <HI>Batta|lia,</HI> that is, ordered into a &s;quare bodie, and &s;ilence &s;trictly commanded; the fir&s;t thing to be taught them, is di&s;tance. And herein authors di&s;agree. Some make clo&s;e order to be 2 paces; open order, 4 paces, and &s;o for double, triple, and qua|druple di&s;tance proportionable. Others make but 2 kindes of di&s;tances: Clo&s;e order, which is 3 foot: and open order, which is 6 foot. But this mu&s;t be under&s;tood <HI>cum grano &s;a|lis:</HI> (as the Civilians &s;peak) for here we mu&s;t ob&s;erve a diffe|rence between the manner of taking the di&s;tance of the Ca|vallrie, and that of the Infanterie: for in the foot, the di|&s;tance is taken from the center of the &s;ouldiers bodie, which here cannot be &s;o under&s;tood, but onely of the &s;pace of ground between hor&s;e and hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Prai&s;&s;ac</HI> is more plain, who would have the di&s;tance between rank and rank (both for the length of the hor&s;e, as al&s;o for the &s;pace between hor&s;e and hor&s;e) to be &s;ix paces, &amp; one pace between file and file.

<P>_THe quarters being thus accommodated, the Commi&s;&s;arie Generall &s;hall depute a Corpo|rall with 12 or 15 hor&s;e, and a trumpet to di&s;cover or &s;cowre the highwayes to|wards the enemies aboad; without which diligence the enemie might charge the Sentinels &s;o &s;udden|ly, and enter with them, as there would be no time for the Corps-de-guard and others to prepare them&s;elves for de|fence. The&s;e do con&s;i&s;t partly of Cuira&s;&s;iers, and partly of Harquebu&s;iers, to give the alarm.

<P>If the Infanterie exceed in number, and &s;o be &s;erried in a gro&s;&s;e body, it will be hard for the Cavallrie to rout them, as hath been found by experience by the Swi&s;&s;es, which &s;till had the better of the hor&s;e, by rea&s;on of their gro&s;&s;e bodies of pikes.</P>

<P>The Sharp pointed (in regard there is but one troop in front and that &s;econded but by two troops on the reare an|gles; then but one troop again, &s;econded as the fir&s;t) &s;eemeth not to be &s;o good as the former, becau&s;e it bringeth few hands to fight, and is very &s;ubject to be<NOTE N="g" PLACE="marg">Whereof <HI>Aelian</HI> &s;heweth the inconve|niences, <HI>cap.</HI> 50.</NOTE> overwinged or overfronted by the enemie, and &s;o to be charged on the flanks.</P>
<P>The Divided, e&s;pecially at &s;o large a di&s;tance, I hold to be dangerous. True it is, that here the Dragons are u&s;ed as foot, but whether &s;o &s;ingle and &s;o extended an order be the be&s;t for them to be placed in, I referre to the judicious.</P>
<P>Now concerning the&s;e &s;ix kindes of battells, they are in deed and in effect but two: that is, the Checquer and the Lunarie, as he calleth them; and from the&s;e grounds the re&s;t be formed.</P>
<P>But the&s;e forms being onely imaginarie, and withall wanting that perfection (in many re&s;pects) which is requi|red in reall battells, I &s;hall now (to give fuller &s;atisfaction to &s;uch as are lovers of militarie knowledge) communicate &s;ome forms of embattellings, which never yet were pub|li&s;hed by any.</P>

<P>For the better under&s;tanding whereof, I have thought fit fir&s;t to put down the&s;e directions following.</P>

(as hath been &s;hewed Part. 2. chap. 3.) Each of which parts is governed by it's particular Officer or Chief; yet &s;o as the ab&s;olute command belongeth to the Generall. The&s;e di&s;tinctions are alwayes &s;o under&s;tood, in the order of marching, to avoid di&s;putes about precedencie; &s;o as they which march foremo&s;t are &s;aid to have the Vanguard, they which march in the middle, the Battell, and they which come la&s;t the Reare. And the&s;e divi&s;ions alter their names according to the place they march in, wherein they ob&s;erve a diuinall change, as hath been &s;hewed in the chapter above mentioned. But if we &s;hall take the meaning of the&s;e words (according to their proprietie and u&s;uall acceptation) in matter of fight or bat|tell, conceiving that that part of the armie which is called the Vanguard &s;hall give the fir&s;t charge; and that which is called the Battell, &s;hall give the &s;econd charge, &amp; the Reare|ward, the la&s;t; it will prove a meere mi&s;take. For we are to know that the fir&s;t charge mu&s;t be given by the fir&s;t troop, or foremo&s;t order of companies which are in front placed as in one rank, extended from the one front-angle of the whole armie, to the other: and &s;o it were impo&s;&s;ible for them to be commanded or directed by one Commander, or Chief of one particular &s;quadron of the armie, by rea&s;on of the large extent thereof: for we &s;ee that the front of the ar|mie embattelled before <HI>Dornick.

(which was farre inferiour to that of late, employed at the &s;iedge of the <HI>Bo&s;&s;ch</HI>) took up<NOTE N="i" PLACE="marg">Six foot make a fa|thom, 100 fathoms a furlong, &s;even fur|longs and a half, a mile. Five foot make a pace, 1000 paces make a mile.</NOTE> 6380 foot of ground (being in their clo&s;e order prepared for fight) which is above a mile and a quar|ter of our mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, if the Vanguard (as it is called) &s;hould give the fir&s;t charge, the Battell (which then mu&s;t &s;econd them) may
<PB N="103" REF="67"> chance to be of a nation not onely differing from the Van|guard, but at variance with them, or el&s;e &s;ome grudge or di&s;|gu&s;t between the Chiefs. And in that re&s;pect they might either neglect or &s;lacken the &s;econding or relieving of tho&s;e of the Vanguard, and not u&s;e that diligence which is re|quired. In con&s;ideration therefore of the&s;e and other incon|veniences, it is be&s;t that every &s;quadron of the armie be &s;o ordered, as each of them may have their fir&s;t, &s;econd, and third troops: by which means every divi&s;ion &s;hall both be commanded by their own Chiefs, and &s;hall al&s;o be &s;econd|ed by tho&s;e of their own &s;quadron, or divi&s;ion; which will give them the more courage and a&s;&s;urance. The manner therefore for the ordering of an armie for battell, is as fol|loweth. That &s;quadron which is called the Battell, is pla|ced in the middle, the Vanguard on the right hand of it, and the Reare on the left: and all the&s;e (u&s;ually) in one front and &s;ingle order; one regiment (or &s;ometimes one compa|nie, e&s;pecially among the hor&s;e as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 10.) flanking the other, as in <HI>Fig.</HI> 12.</P>
<P>From hence the fir&s;t troop of every divi&s;ion is drawn up, and placed in an even front or &s;traight line, from one angle of the bodie to the other. At a convenient<NOTE N="k" PLACE="marg">U&s;ually 300 foot.</NOTE> di&s;tance behinde the&s;e, the &s;econd troop of every &s;quadron is placed, in an even rank, as the former; but &s;o as the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="marg">The Romanes al&s;o ordered their battells in three divi&s;ions, or troops: <HI>viz.</HI> their <HI>Ha|&s;tati, Principes,</HI> and <HI>Tri|arii.</HI> The fir&s;t were called <HI>Acies prima,</HI> and the&s;e were the <HI>Ha&s;ta|ti</HI> which were to give the fir&s;t charge.

Indeed with antiquitie, when the ar|mie was embattelled and readie for combat, it was u&s;uall for the Generall to deliver &s;ome &s;et &s;peech, either from &s;ome higher place of turf or &s;tone, or at the head of the troops; and riding among&s;t the Maniples to encourage his &s;ouldi|ers.

Next to this, they &s;ounded the <HI>Cla&s;&s;icum</HI> (that is) a generall charge; and this was &s;econded by a generall &s;hout of the &s;ouldiers, or a concu&s;&s;ion of their arms.

<P>THus have I breifly (according to my weak abilitie) runne through that part of the Art militarie, which principally concerneth the Cavallrie: Which &s;ubject I have the rather cho&s;en to treat of, becau&s;e it is &s;o little and &s;o &s;paringly handled by tho&s;e that have given us dire|ctions for warre, and le&s;&s;e ob&s;erved in our ordinarie practi&s;e,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Witne&s;&s;e tho&s;e fre|quent and &s;harp repre|hen&s;ions, expre&s;&s;ed in his Maje&s;ties letters, from time to time: a|mong others, <HI>that of the</HI> 21 <HI>of September.</HI> 1628, from <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI> And the continuall &amp; &s;erious callings upon for reformation, by the letter, from the Lords of his Maje&s;ties mo&s;t honourable pri|vie coun&s;ell, and the right honourable the Lords Lieutenants of every county.</NOTE> e&s;pecially in the exerci&s;e of our trained troops here at home.
