<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE Principal Officers OF HIS MAJESTIES Ordnance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Principal Officers of His Maje&s;ties Ord|nance, having to the utmo&s;t of their Power, in both the <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars carried them&s;elves with all Care and Indu&s;try in the Execution of their &s;everal Places, in furni&s;hing His Maje&s;ties Fleets, and
<PB N="4" REF="3">Men of War with good, &s;ufficient and &s;erviceable Gun|ners Stores, and fitted them with early Supplies, at all Times when required; for which they have had the thanks of his Royal Highne&s;s, of his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and his Grace the Duke of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> in the fir&s;t War; and of his Royal Highne&s;s, and his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in this la&s;t War: and although they have met with &s;everal Mi&s;takes of &s;ome Per&s;ons who have re|ported the <HI>Dutch</HI> Guns and Powder to have been better and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of His Maje&s;ties, (who yet have acknowledged their Errours, when by Experience &s;ome of them have &s;een by Proof that His Maje&s;ties Powder is &s;tronger, and by &frac14; better than the <HI>Dutch</HI>) they looked upon &s;uch Reports as the Effects rather of mi&s;informa|tion, than of malicious <SUBST>
<DEL>&s;candal</DEL>
<ADD>&s;lander</ADD>
</SUBST>. But now finding Them|&s;elves and their Actions bla&s;ted and brought upon the Stage in a &s;candalous lying Pamphlet in Print, entitled, <HI>an exact Relation of the &s;everal Engagements, &amp;c. under the Command of Prince</HI> Rupert; and perceiving how that Libel had already influenced &s;everal Per&s;ons to their Prejudice; they have thought fit to manife&s;t to All Per&s;ons, Lovers of Honour and of Truth, in De|fence of them&s;elves, and of the Right Honourable Sir <HI>Thomas Chicheley</HI> Knight, Ma&s;ter General of His Maje|&s;ties Ordnance (by who&s;e Endeavours, Intere&s;t, and un|&s;potted Fidelity, His Maje&s;ties Service in this Office hath &s;o well proceeded) That at no time in any of the&s;e late Wars again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> His Maje&s;ties Fleets were better provided with Canon, Powder, Shot, and all Ammunition, and Stores of War, than that &s;et out this la&s;t Spring under his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI> To which may be added the other great Stores of War, <HI>viz.</HI> of
<PB N="5" REF="3">Granadoes for Morterpieces and Hand, Fire Arms, Pikes, Powder, Shot, Scaling Ladders, Turnpikes, and many other chargeable Stores for Land Service, which by his Highne&s;s Particular Order, were provided and laden upon &s;ix great Ships under the Charge of <HI>Jonas Moore</HI> E&s;quire, who attended upon the Prince, and was on Board with him in the two fir&s;t Engage|ments. And at the la&s;t going out in <HI>July</HI> they provided (be&s;ides the Supply of Gunners Stores for the whole Navy, with all its Tenders) all fitting Stores and Equi|page for the Land Forces, and Train of Artillery then de&s;igned; that is to &s;ay, All manner of Arms, Offen|&s;ive and Defen&s;ive, Ammunition of all &s;orts, Hor&s;es, Tents for 10000 Men, Habiliments of War of all kinds, and other Uten&s;ils and In&s;truments, as well for Intrenchments as Surprizes, in ca&s;e a De&s;cent had been made either upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> or el&s;ewhere. All which to the value of 40000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and upward, have been by them &s;ent out extraordinarily, and upon the Credit of the Office the la&s;t Summer, without one Pen|ny advanced for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This being in general premi&s;ed; they come now to an&s;wer more particularly to &s;uch unju&s;t Accu&s;ations, as this fal&s;e and &s;candalous Libeller hath been plea&s;ed to lay upon them; which are the&s;e that follow.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>The fir&s;t, is in Page the Seventh; wherein he declares (to the Scandal and Infamy of the Stout Brave Seamen and Souldiers of this Nation) <HI>How faint the Hearts of the whole Fleet were</HI> (he mea&s;ured certainly by his own) <HI>for want of Workmen and
<PB N="6" REF="4">Tools, Seamen, &amp; Supplies,</HI> and this before the Fleet engaged.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Second is in Page the Twelfth, where, after the Second Engagement in <HI>June,</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>The Com|manders exclaimed that they had not &s;ufficient Supplies, but were in Want of Powder, Shot, &amp;c.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>The Third is in the la&s;t Page of this Libel, where he enumerates the Difficulties and the Wants the Fleet was in. Of which, <HI>The fayler of Provi&s;i|ons, and Want of Ammunition, and all other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries</HI> are reckoned as Part.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e black and fal&s;e A&s;per&s;ions can no way better (in few Lines) be cleared, than fir&s;t by declaring,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. What Ammunition and Stores were provided and &s;ent on Board the Fleet, from this Office be|fore it went out.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What Supplies were made after the Engage|ments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And la&s;tly, what Ammunition, Powder, Shot, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were remaining on Board the beginning of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, when the Fleet returned, and a General Remain was taken by Order of the Office, as may appear by the Books and Gun|ners Accompts remaining in the &s;aid Office.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And here they cannot but take Notice and declare
<PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y">that in the fir&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> War, forty Rounds (that is Pow|der and Shot to each Gun to be forty Times di&s;charged) was as great a Proportion as the Ships could &s;tow and take in. Some Ships indeed might take in more by rea&s;on of their Built, but tho&s;e were but few.</P>
<P>This Rule will be&s;t be judged of by the Powder, not naming (for Brevities &s;ake) the re&s;t of the Stores.</P>
<P>Twelve thou&s;and Barrels of Powder completed the Proportion of 40 Rounds to tho&s;e 60 Sayl of Ships which were commanded by his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> this la&s;t Summer (many other of His Maje&s;ties Ships at the &s;ame time being el&s;ewhere imployed:) which Propor|tion of 12000 Barrels with Shot and all other Stores an&s;werable, the &s;aid Ships carried out with them in <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, and they had be&s;ide &s;ix Ve&s;&s;els attending them with much Powder and Shot, &s;ent after as is before mentio|ned according to the Princes Order, than which a great|er Proportion, or better, was never before &s;ent. So that as to the fir&s;t Accu&s;ation, there was no Rea&s;on that the Hearts of the whole Fleet &s;hould faint (as doubtle&s;s this Cowardly Libellers did.) And if Succe&s;s had been an&s;werable to their Supplies, this Apology had not needed.</P>
<P>At the Return of the Fleet to the <HI>Buoy of the Nore,</HI> which was the Eighth of <HI>June,</HI> the Officers by dire|ctions of the Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance had provided five thou&s;and Barrels of Powder, with Shot and Ammuni|tion proportionable, and the Tenth of <HI>June</HI> &s;ixteen great Ve&s;&s;els loaden with the &s;aid Powder and Stores,
<PB N="8" REF="5" MS="y">were at Anchor near the Fleet under the Charge of Sir <HI>Jonas Moore,</HI> Ma&s;ter Surveyor of his Maje&s;ties Ord|nance, and <HI>Samuel Fortrey</HI> E&s;quire, Clerk of the Deli|veries; where they found tho&s;e Ships &s;ent along with Stores for Supply of the Fleet returned into the <HI>Swale,</HI> without having Delivered any Part or Parcel of their Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Fleet might have been &s;upplied with Gunners Stores in a few Dayes, but many Ships were to be re|paired, which the Officers and Commi&s;&s;ioners of His Maje&s;ty's Navy (whom this Libeller hath likewi&s;e mo&s;t unju&s;tly a&s;per&s;ed) with all po&s;&s;ible Indu&s;try and Ex|pedition refitted within le&s;s than three Weeks time: So that by the fir&s;t Week in <HI>July,</HI> the Fleet was &s;upplied with 4100 Barrels of Powder, Shot, and other Stores an&s;werable, making up with what they had remaining on Board the entire Complement of forty Rounds: Upon which the Fleet &s;ailed, and fourteen Store-Ships belonging to this Office attending thereon.</P>
<P>By this it appears how fal&s;e his &s;econd Scandal is, for that the Fleet had not &s;pent little above One third of their Stores of War, <HI>viz.</HI> 4100, of 12000 Barrels. And none of the Commanders, except this Malicious Libel|ler, could exclaim for want of Powder and Shot.</P>
<P>At the Return of the Fleet in <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> after the third and la&s;t Engagement, the Officers of the Ordnance &s;ent again another Supply of 5000 Barrels of Powder, and Stores proportionable; but that might have been &s;pared, toge|ther with the great Charge of Freight and Demurrage;
<PB N="9" REF="5">for the Fleet had &s;pent little more than a &s;ixth Part of their Powder and Stores, <HI>viz.</HI> 2000, of 12000 Barrels, as by the Remains in the Office appears, there being above 9000 Barrels of Powder brought back in the Fleet, be&s;ides the Stores &s;ent along, which likewi&s;e re|turned without any Diminution, clearly &s;hewing his la&s;t Accu&s;ation to be as fal&s;e as any of the re&s;t; and it is as plain that in all the three Engagements, not much above half the Stores of War of the fir&s;t Supply were ex|pended.</P>
<P>To give one further &s;atisfactory In&s;tance touching the Expence of Powder, One Ship which was confe&s;&s;ed by all to have been mo&s;t engaged, will afford a clear De|mon&s;tration, <HI>viz.</HI> the Royal Prince. Her fir&s;t Comple|ment was 430 Barrels, the Supply &s;he took in 176 Barrels, in all 606 Barrels. The Gunner brought back and deli|vered in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t 395 Barrels, with Stores an&s;wera|ble, to this Office, which makes the Expence &s;omething above One third. Nay, the <HI>Rupert,</HI> which made mo&s;t complaint, brought back with her two thirds of her Powder and Stores.</P>
<Q><HI>Ab &V;no, di&s;ce Omnes&mdash;</HI></Q>
<P>To conclude; by what hath been &s;aid, no Per&s;on can have rea&s;on to believe this fal&s;e Libeller, but on the con|trary to acquit the Officers of the Ordnance, as having done their Duties, by timely furni&s;hing out, and fully re|&s;upplying His Maje&s;ty's Fleet this la&s;t Summer. And they cannot but with humble Thanks acknowledge the Honour which his Highne&s;s Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> hath done them, by often declaring as much, both publickly and otherwi&s;e.</P>
