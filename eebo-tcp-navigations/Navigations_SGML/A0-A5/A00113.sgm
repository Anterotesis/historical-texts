<P>_TRuelye we finde in the ge&s;tes &amp; faites of the good kynge Charlemayne that vpo~ a time at a fea&s;t of Pentheco&s;te the &s;ayde kyng Charle|mayne kept a ryght great and &s;olemp|ne court at Parys, after that he was come againe fro the partyes of Lom|bardy where he had had a ryght great and meruaylous batayle ayen&s;t the Sara&s;yns, and &s;uche folke as were oute of the beleue, wherof the cheef of the &s;ayde Sara&s;ins was named Gui|thelym the &s;e&s;ne. The whiche the &s;aid kynge Charlemayne by hys prowe&s;&s;e and valyauntnes had dy&s;comfyted &amp; ouercomen. At the which battaylle and dy&s;comfyture dyed greate noble|ne&s;&s;es of kinges, princes, Dukes, Er|les, barons, knyghtes and &s;quyers. As Salamon of bretayne. Huon erle of Mauns, &s;yr yues, &s;yr yuoyre beren|ger, and Haton, &s;yr Arnaulde of Be|aulande, &s;yr walleraunte of Bollon and many valyaunte knyghtes. The Hou&s;e peres of Fraunce were come there and many Almaynes and Eng|ly&s;hemenne. Normans Poeteuyns. Lombardes and Barnyers. And a|monge other Dukes &amp; princes was come thyther. The good and worthye duke Aymes of Ardeyne. And in his felaw&s;hyp his foure fayre &s;onnes, that is to wyt Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nawde, Alarde, Guycharde, and Rycharde, that were wonderfull fayre, wytty, great, migh|tye, and valyaunte, &s;pecyally Rey|nawde whiche was the greate&s;t and the talle&s;t manne that was founde at that tyme in al the worlde. For he had xvi. feete of length and more. Than at this a&s;&s;emble and fea&s;t: &s;tood the &s;ayd kynge Charlemayne on his feete a|monge his prynces and barons, &s;ay|inge in this wy&s;e, barons my brethe|ren and freendes, ye knowe howe I haue conque&s;ted and gotten &s;o manye greate londes by youre helpe and &s;uc|cours. So many of the Sara&s;ins and mi&s;beleuers brought to death, &amp; in my &s;ubieccion, how but late agoe ye haue &s;eene by y^e paynni Guerelym whiche I haue dy&s;comfyted &amp; ouercomen, and reduced to the chri&s;ten faith. Notwith+&s;tandynge
<PB REF="7"> we haue lo&s;te there ryghte greate cheualry and noblene&s;&s;e. And for faute of many of oure va&s;&s;aylles and &s;ubiectes that to vs dayneth not to come, howe be it that we had &s;ent for theym, as the Duke Rycharde of Rou&s;&s;ellon, the duke Dron of Nan|tuell, and the duke Benes of Aygre|mounte, that been all three bretherne Germayne. Wherof vnto you I com|playne me, and tell you that yf it we|re not &s;yr Salamon that worthylye came to &s;uccoure vs with .xxx. thou|&s;ande fygheynge menne, and &s;yr Lam|breyght bernyer and &s;yr Geffraye of Bourdelle with walleraunce of Bul|lon that bare our baner: we were alle dy&s;comfyted and lo&s;t as ye all knowe wel, and this by the defaut of the &s;aid three bretherene that dayned neuer to come to our &s;endynge, nor obey, and aboue all the duke Benes of Aygre|mounte. All be it that they be all oure lyege menne that euer owen to me &s;er|uyce and fydelytie. Now I &s;hal &s;ende hym worde that he come to &s;erue me at this nexte &s;omer with all his po|wer.

And I &s;hall &s;ert all his londes in fyre. Than the good Duke Naymes of Bauyere ro&s;e vp dyligently and &s;aid to kynge Charle|mayne in this wy&s;e. Syr me &s;emeth that ye ought not to angre your &s;elfe &s;o &s;ore. And yf ye will beleue my coun|&s;ell: ye &s;hal &s;ende a me&s;&s;anger to the duke of Aygremount which me&s;&s;an|ger &s;hal be wel and honourably accom+panied.

And for doubte of deathe &s;hall not leue nothynge vn&s;ayd of hys me&s;&s;age to the duke benes, but there was no|ne of them all that oughte an&s;wered. For manye of theim were of Sybbe to hym. As the duke Aymon of Ardeyne that was his brother Germayne.</P>
<P>Thus were the foure brethern of one father and of one mother. Than was kynge Charlemayne ryghte wrothe and angrye.

And I &s;hall depart to morow in the mornyng by the grace of God.</P>
<P>Than &s;hould you haue &s;ene y^e king weepe of pitie for his &s;onne Lohier For he repented him y^t he had char|ged him for to doo this me&s;&s;age, but &s;yn y^t he had &s;o &s;ayd: he mu&s;t doo it. And the morne was come Lohier &amp; his noble company made them re|dy and after lept on hor&s;backe, and came afore y^e kyng. Than &s;ayd Lo|hier to the king his father. Syr here I am redye and all my folke for to fulfyll your wyll. Fayre &s;onne &s;ayd Charlemayne I reco~mend thee vn|to god that on y^e cro&s;&s;e &s;uffred death and pa&s;&s;ion, and hym I be&s;eche to kepe and waraunt thee &amp; al thy fe|law&s;hyp from euyl &amp; from any com|braunce, than departed Lohier and his company, wherof after warde the kynge made great lamentacyon for his &s;onne Lohier, and not wyth out a cau&s;e. For he &s;hal neuer &s;ee hi~ quicke agayne as ye &s;hal vnder&s;ta~d yf ye wyll kerken it. Now go the ge~|till me&s;&s;angers &s;treyght to warde Aygremount, &s;ore thretenynge the duke Benes of Aygremou~t, &s;aying that they &s;hould take the head from the body of hym yf he doo ought to them agayn&s;t his deuoyre. But it &s;hal go all other wy&s;e w^t them. For it haped all contrary to theyr myn|des and purpo&s;e wherof afterward many ladyes abode widowes w^tout hu&s;ba~des, &amp; many gentil wome~ with out a louer. And &s;o many churches de&s;troyed, and &s;o many landes bre~te and wa&s;ted; wherof it is yet pitie for to &s;ee. And thus ridinge &amp; thretynge Benes of Aygremount, a &s;py heard all that they &s;ayd, and came ha&s;telye to Aygremo &s;it to ward Benes that was in his Palays and tolde hym how me&s;&s;a~gers were coming vnto hym from kyng Charlemayne that &s;ore thretened him, and that the &s;o~ne of kyng Charlemayne was there in per&s;on.

Than &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">+ke a good knyght that was called &s;yr Simon, &amp; &s;ayd. My lorde I &s;hal coun&s;el you truly yf ye wyll herken and beleue me. Receyue honourably the me&s;&s;angers of the kynge Char|lemayne. For wel ye wote that he is your ryght wy&s;e lorde, and wit that who y^t warreth again&s;t his &s;ouerayn Lorde: he doth agayn&s;t god &amp; ray&s;on and haue no regarde to your kynne nor to thys that your bretherne Gy|rarde of Rou&s;&s;yllon and the duke of Nantuell wolde not obey hym. For I aduy&s;e you wel that Charlemayn is myghty, and he &s;hall di&s;troye you
<PB REF="8"> of body and of goodes, but yf that ye obey him. And yf ye amiablie go to hym, he &s;hall haue mercy of you. Than an&s;wered the duke that thus he wolde not doo, and that the &s;ayd knight gaue him euill coun&s;ell. For yet &s;ayd he I am not &s;o low brought but that I haue three brythren that &s;hall helpe to &s;u&s;teine and beare out my warre agayn&s;t Charlemayne, &amp; al&s;o my foure neuewes the &s;onnes of my brother Aymes of Dordon y^t ben full fayre knightes, worthy and wel taught in faytes of warre. Alas &s;ayd than y^e duche&s;&s;e. My good lorde beleue your good coun&s;ell. For no men &s;hall pray&s;e you that ye make warre agayn&s;t your right wy&s;e lorde, and wit it well that it is agayn&s;t the co~maundementes of God, &amp; again&s;t all equitie. Wherfore yf ye haue mi&s;|doone any thi~g agayn&s;t hym, doo &s;o much y^t ye be accorded w^t him. And take none heed to your brethern, as &s;yr Symon dothe coun&s;ell you. For neuer good may come therof for to be euyl in fauoure w^t his &s;ouerayne Lorde. Than behelde the duke the duche&s;&s;e in great wrathe and had her that &s;he &s;hould holde her peace in y^e deuilles name, &amp; that &s;he &s;hould ne|uer more &s;peake to hym of this ma|ter. For in certayne he &s;hould not do for the kyng Charlemayne the mou~+tenaunce of a peny. So helde her pe|ace y^e duche&s;&s;e &amp; &s;ayd that &s;he &s;hould &s;peake nomore to hym therof.</P>
<P>GReat was the noy&s;e and the bruyte within the palayce of Aygremount, for &s;ome coun&s;elled the duke, that thus as the duche&s;&s;e &s;ayd: he &s;hould doo, and many other &s;ayd nay. Than &s;ayd the duke vnto them that coun&s;elled him naye and that he &s;hould not accorde nor make peace with the kyng Charlemayne, that he could theym thanke, muche longe they &s;pake of this mater. And the me&s;&s;angers of the Kyng Charle|mayne duryng the &s;ame haue riden &s;o muche that they ben come to Ay|gremount. And the ca&s;tell was &s;ee vpon a roche ryght hye and well en+uyroned with &s;tronge walles thycke highe and wel garny&s;hed with great towres, &s;o that for the &s;trength and &s;ytuacyon of the ca&s;tell, it was im|prenable, but only by famy&s;hynge.</P>
<P>Than &s;ayd Lohier to y^e lordes that were wyth hym. Lordes nowe &s;ee what a fortre&s;&s;e is there, what wal|les what a ryuer te~neth at the foote of it? I beleue verely that in al chri&s;|tendome is not her lyke. It can ne|uer betake by force, but yf it is by fa|my&s;&s;hyng. Tha~ &s;pake a knight that was called Sauary and &s;ayd to Lo|hier his lorde, &s;yr &s;ayde he it &s;emeth me (&s;pekynge vnder correccion) that my lorde the kynge Charlemayne your father hath enterpri&s;ed a great foly, whan he troweth to come to at an ende of this duke of Aygremou~t for in good &s;othe he is right pui&s;&s;au~t And I beleue that he &s;hall make as mani men for to make the warre, as &s;hall my lorde your father yf it cam there to that he wolde make hym warre. It were a fayre thynge yf they myght be accorded together, and of my parte I &s;houlde coun&s;ell the &s;ame yf it myght be doone.</P>
<P>But well I wot that yf your father
<PB N="iii" REF="8"> had hym, al y^e golde in Paris &s;hould not kepe hym, but that he &s;hould do hange hym or els &s;lea hym quycke. So be&s;eche I you ryght deere &s;yr y^t ye &s;peake humbly vnto the duke be|nes of Aygremou~t. For in certayne he is ryght fyers and outragyous &amp; incontinent might haue there a &s;ore meddle betwene you and hym, wher of the lo&s;&s;e &s;hould tourne vpon vs. For we ben to lew folke. Than an|&s;wered Lohier and &s;ayd to hym that he &s;ayd well and wy&s;ely, but alway|es &s;ayd he we doubt hym not of any thynge. We be here al redy an ho~dred knyghtes well appoynted, and for &s;othe yf he &s;ay vnto vs anye thynge vnto our dy&s;plea&s;ure: he &s;halbe the fyr&s;t that &s;hall repent and be &s;ory for it. Than &s;ayd the knight Sauare al &s;oftly to hym&s;elf, that this were not wy&s;ely doone. For wel I &s;were &s;aid he vpon my fayth that yf it hap you to &s;ay any thyng to hym that by any maner &s;hall di&s;plea&s;e hym: he &s;hall make you &s;orye and &s;hall wreke it vpon you bodye. And happelye we &s;hall all be in a waye for to dy. Syr aduy&s;e your &s;elfe well &amp; wyll to pro|cede prudently in your me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>For well I &s;ay vnto you that he is ryght cruell, and of greate worthy|ne&s;&s;e accomply&s;&s;hed.</P>
<P>THus &s;pekyng of one thyng and of other rode &s;o longe the me&s;|&s;angers, that they ben come to the gate of the ca&s;tel which was &s;one &s;het by the porter, then knocked the &s;ayd knightes, and the porter an&s;we+red to them. Lordes what be you?</P>
<P>Freende an&s;wered Lohier open to vs this gate pre&s;ently. For we wyll &s;peake to the Duke Benes of Aigre+mount from the kinge Charlemayn Now abyde you a lytle and ha&s;t you not &s;ayd the porter. And I wyl goe &s;peake redely to my lorde the Duke. So went the &s;ayde porter into the halle where he &s;awe the Duke his lorde. He kneeled incontynent afore him &amp; tolde him howe downe at the gate was a right great company of men of armes. And that they were well an hondred men or more ryght well hor&s;ed &amp; well armed, and with them is the elde&s;t &s;onne of king char+lemayne y^t &s;trongly threteneth you, and al&s;o your folke. My lorde &s;ayde the porter &s;hall I open the gates vn+to the~, yea &s;ayd y^e duke For I doubt them nothynge, and we ben ynough for them. And many worthy knygh|tes and e&s;quyers ben no where able for to defende vs all, were Charle|mayne him&s;elf with them with hys pui&s;&s;au~ce. So ran incontine~t the por+ter downe agayne for to open vnto them the gate. Lohier &amp; his felowes entred w^tin and mounted vp vnto the dongeon of the ca&s;tell where the duke was that &s;ayd to hys barons. Lordes heere cometh the elde&s;t &s;onne of the kyng Charlemayne for to tell me his me&s;&s;age. But (di y^t god y^t &s;uf|fred death and pa&s;&s;yon) Yf he &s;peake wy&s;ely to vs he &s;hal do as &s;age. And yf he &s;ayth any thyng that &s;hall dy&s;|plea&s;e vs, we &s;hall &s;oone &amp; without delaye take vengeaunce therof. So was the duke Benes well accom|panyed &amp; nobly of wel two hondred knyghtes &amp; more. Thys was in the moneth of May that all creatures
<PB REF="9"> humain ought wel for to reioyce the~ and that folke preu and worthy in armes taken hert and hardine&s;&s;e for to defende them &s;elf wel, and warre agayn&s;t theyr enemyes. And this du+ring: Lohier the &s;onne of King char|lemayne entred into the halle of the Palays of Aygremount ryght no|bly armed and his folke al&s;o, and &s;aw the halle ryght well garny&s;hed of fayre folke rychelye arayed. And the duke &s;ittynge right proudlye a|monge his barons, and the duche&s;&s;e hys wyfe next by hym, and before hym his &s;onne Mawgys that was a great may&s;ter of the &s;cience of Ni|gromancy that played afore his fa|ther of his art of nigromancy, wher+in the Lordes that were there tooke great plea&s;ure. And wit it well that in all the worlde was not a wor|thyer chry&s;ten, nor more able, than was the &s;ayd Mawgys. Except on|lye hys co&s;yn Reynawde one of the Sonnes of Aymon, wherof &s;pecyal|ly treateth now this Hi&s;tory. Than marched forthe Lohier and wente in the fyr&s;t of all, and after hym hys folke by good conduyte. And &s;alued the duke B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nes of Agremount in thys wy&s;e, wherby moch great euill happed vnto him at la&s;t. That God that created y^e firmament and made all thynge of nought for the people to &s;u&s;teyne. And on the cro&s;&s;e &s;uffred death and pa&s;&s;yon for all &s;oules to be redemed out of the paynes of hel: keep and &s;aue the king Charlemay|ne Emperour of Aimayne and king of Fraunce and all hys noble lyne and confound thee Duke Benes of Aygremounte.

Where by thy faute were dead there Bawdoyne lorde of Melanke. Ge&s;froi of Bourdel, and many other great Dukes Prynces knyghtes and barons. And yf thou wylt not doo it: I tell thee (duke be|nes) that the kinge &s;hall come vpon thee wyth an hundred thou&s;and men of armes. So &s;halt thou be take and brought into Fraunce.

<P>Doo therfore this that I commau~d thee in the kinges behalfe, for thou knowe&s;t well that thou arte his ma~ va&s;&s;ayle and &s;ubiecte.</P>
<P>WHan the Duke Benes of ay+gremount had heard Lohy|er thus &s;peake: Than yf ye had &s;ene hym chaunged hys coloure pouffe &amp; blowe, as a ma~ cruel, proude and outrageou&s;e, and &s;ayd to Lohier in thys maner.

For I hold nother Ca&s;tell ne Fortre&s;&s;e of hym, but I &s;hall goe vpon him with all my puy&s;&s;aunce, and &s;hall de&s;troy all the lande of Fraunce vnto Parys.

<P>And it the king knew now that thou thretene&s;t hym thus as thou doe&s;t: he &s;hould come incontynent vpon thee, and &s;hould vtterli de&s;troy thee, well thou knowe&s;t that thou arte hys liege man, and that thou canne not &s;ay agayn&s;t it, come than redely and &s;erue thy &s;ouerayne lorde kinge Charlemyan, and beleue me yf thou wyll &s;aue thyne owne lyfe. For if y^u doo it not: I make thee &s;ure and cer|tayne y^t yf he can haue thee by force that he &s;hall make thee to be hanged there as the ayre and the wyndes w^t theyr great bla&s;tes &s;hall dry vp the bones of thee.

I &s;hall &s;ende for my deere bre+therne Gerrade of Rou&s;&s;yllon, and Dron of Natuell, and Garnyer his &s;onne, and than we &s;hal gone vpon kyng Charlemayne, and yf I canne mete with him in any place: we &s;hall de&s;troy hym, &amp; &s;hall doo of hym that he troweth to doo of me. Wene he y^t I am a cowarde? nay by my faythe, for I &s;hould not take all the gold in Parys but that I &s;hould &s;lea y^e me&s;|&s;anger. Euyll was to hym whan he dur&s;t &s;o threten me. And than &s;ayde Lohier, I nether pray&s;e you nor do|ubt you not. Whan the Duke benes of Agremount vnder&s;tode Lohyer: he wexed for great wrathe as red as ony fyre in hys face, and began to ry&s;e vp and to call. Nowe Barons vpon hym, brynge hym to me, for he &s;hall neuer be wraunted but that I &s;hall make hym to dye &s;hamefullye. And the baro~s dur&s;t not &s;ay again&s;t theyr lorde, but drew al theyr &s;wer|des. And incontynent did ren vpon Charlemaynes folke. And Lohier called his baner, and than began he and his folke to defende them &s;elfe &s;harpely. And god knoweth howe many heades and armes were there cut of y^t day. For at the &s;ame houre: began a thynge, wherof afterwarde &s;o manye ladyes and damoy&s;elles were w^t out hu&s;bandes &amp; wythout louers, &s;o many of children father|le&s;&s;e,
<PB REF="10"> and &s;o manye chirches wa&s;ted and di&s;troyed that neuer &s;ythe were repayred. What &s;hal I tel you more? wyt it that they fought there &s;o longe wythin the halle of the Pa|lays: that the noys went through all the towne. Tha~ &s;hould ye haue &s;een the bourgeys, Marchauntes, &amp; men of craft with axes &s;werdes and other wepyns, and came to the Ca&s;tel war+de aboute &s;euen thou&s;and men and more. But the entre of the Palays of Aygremount was narow, and y^e Frenche men were within that kept them well that they entred not in at theyr ca&s;e. Alas what terryble and vnhappy a &s;laughter was there that daye. For the folke of kyng Charle|mayne were but a few to the regard of them of the other parte. And as ye may knowe &s;uche a&s;&s;emble was ryght euyll. So defended them &s;elfe moche noblye and valyauntlye the folke of kyng Charlemayne and &s;o muche that Lohier &s;eynge that, that he and hys folke had the wor&s;e: he &s;mote a knight by fore y^e duke Be|nes of Aygremount by &s;uche a wy&s;e that he ouerthrew hym downe dead forth &s;ayd he gods cur&s;e haue thou, and afterward he &s;ayd pyteou&s;ly in waylyng him&s;elfe. Lorde God that within the holy wombe of the ble&s;|&s;ed vyrgyn Marye tooke thy her|bowrynge and &s;uffred death &amp; pa&s;|&s;yon for to redeme mankynde, wilt defende me thys daye from &s;hame|full death and from tourment, for I wot well, but yt it be that your hygh diuynitie &s;ocoure me this day: I &s;hall not &s;ee y^e king Charlemayne my father no more. Than the Duke called hygh vpon hym &s;ayenge, Lo|hier &s;o helpe me God thys day &s;hall be your la&s;te. It &s;hall not be &s;o &s;ayde Lohyer. And with this he &s;mote the Duke vpon the head, but hys helme &s;aued hym. And the &s;troke de&s;cended to the heele of him &s;o that the bloud ranne out. By God &s;ayd Lohier ye &s;hall not e&s;cape. Than came the du|ke Benes of Aigremount to him as woode and &s;ore an angred, &s;ayinge I &s;hould pray&s;e my &s;elfe full lytle it I might not auenge me vpon thee. So heaued vp the Duke hys brande of &s;teele and &s;mote Lohyer &s;o harde vpon hys bryght helme that he cle|ued hym to the teeth. And Lohyer fell dead afore hym. vpon the paue|ment of the Halle. Ha God what great domage hath done the Duke Benes of Aygremou~t to haue thus &s;layne Lohier the elde&s;t &s;onne of the great kyng Charlemayne. Forafter+warde al the o&s;te of Fraunce was in moche great and innumerable tour+mente therfore and in ryght greate payne continual, and the Duke him+&s;elfe dyed therfore, full &s;oryly. That was the payment that he had for it, as ye here after &s;hall heare yf pea&s;y|bly ye wyll heare me.</P>
<P>NOw is outrageou&s;lye &s;layne the good Lohyer the elde&s;t &s;onne of kinge Charlemayne And y^e duke Benes of Aygremount full of cruelnes tooke the hed from the bo+dy of hym.

They an&s;wered, Syr wee &s;hall doo that, that &s;hall plea&s;e you to commaunde vs. Tha~ the Duke dyd doo make redyly a by|ere, and made the corps of Lohyer to be put wythin the &s;ayd byere. And after he delyuered it to his .x. knigh+tes that were left on lyue and put it in a carte to drawe wyth two hor|&s;es. And the Duke conueyed theym thorough the Towne.

<P>&para; But nowe we &s;hall heere leaue to &s;peake of the me&s;&s;angers and &s;hall tell you of the Kynge Charlemayne that was at Parys.</P>

But by my crowne yf he haue &s;o doone, or any thynge that turneth to dy&s;plea&s;ure or dommage to my &s;ayd &s;onne: I &s;hal go vpo~ him wyth a hundred thou&s;and men and &s;hall make hym to be hanged at a+gybet.

He is your liege man, and ought to &s;erue, pray&s;e and honoure you. Alwayes yf he hath tre&s;pa&s;|&s;ed agayn&s;t you in any manere I am ryght &s;orye for it, and yf ye haue a cau&s;e to be wrothe wyth hym, I haue heare my foure &s;onnes, That

<P>And it is my wyll that ye make the~ to come hether pre&s;ently to the ende that I make them knightes, and I &s;hall gyue to them Ca&s;telles, tow|res and Townes, and Cities ynou+gh. Than &s;ent the duke Aymes In|continent for hys children, and made them to come afore kynge Charle|mayne. And whan the king Charle|mayne &s;aw them: they plea&s;ed him moche, and Reynawde was the fir&s;t that &s;pake and &s;ayd. Syr yf it plea&s;e yon for to make vs knyghtes, we &s;halbe euer redy for to &s;erue you and your noble Lord&s;hyp. Tha~ the king Charlemayne called hys &s;tewarde and &s;ayd to hym. Bringe to me the armes that were the kynge Cedres whyche I haue wyth my handes &s;layne in batayle before Pampelune and &s;hall gyue theym to the gentyll Reynawde as to hym that is as I wene the mo&s;te valyaunt of all, and of other good armes I &s;hall gyue to the other three bretherne. So brou|ght there the &s;tewarde y^e armes that were full fayre and riche, and than were armed the foure gentyl brethre~ children to the good Aimes of dordo~|ne, and Ogyer of Denmarke that was of theyr kynne dyd on theyr &s;purres to the new knight Reynaw+de, &amp; the kynge Charlemayne gyrde hym his &s;wearde, and than doubed him to a Knighte &s;ayinge God en|creace in thee goodnes, honour, and worthines. And than mounted Rei|nawde on hor&s;backe vpon Bayard that was &s;uche a hor&s;e, that neuer was his like in all the world nor ne|uer &s;hall be except Bu&s;ifal the hor&s;e of the great Kinge Alexander.

<P>The &s;ayd Bayard thys hor&s;e was growen in the I&s;le of Boru&s;ca~, and Mawgys the &s;onne of the duke Be|nes of Aygremount had gyue~ to his co&s;in Reynawde, that after made the Kynge Charlemayne full wrothe and &s;ory, as ye &s;hal now heare here after.</P>
<P>REynawde was a hor&s;e backe w^t a Sheelde paynted hangyng at his necke, and thwerled his &s;wer|de by great fyer&s;ne&s;&s;e. And wyt wel that he was a fayre knight woun|derful great and well founded, and of hym was a fayre &s;yght, for well he &s;emed one of the mo&s;te valyaunt Knightes that men coulde fynde in all the worlde.

Neuer was nor &s;hall be &s;ene &s;o fayre a man of ar+mes as Reynawde, god encrea&s;e to hym honour and worthyne&s;&s;e, good|nes and pry&s;e. And after were moche honourably and worthily a|rayed and armed the other three bre|therne of Reynawde, and &s;ith lyght all on hor&s;ebacke vnder Saint Vic|tor nyghe Parys. Than made the kinge Charlemayne to &s;et vp in the

<P>THe Emperour Charlemaine after the Iu&s;tynge was do|one: he retourned to his Palays in Parys.

Nor I &s;hall neuer haue Ioye at my herte. For it is he that I loue be&s;t in this worlde. Syr &s;ayd y^e duke Nay|mes I beleue not &s;uch thinges, nor vnto &s;uche dremes ye &s;hall not gyue no credence, alwayes &s;ayde the king yf he haue doone &s;o: I &s;hall neuer le|ue him the value of a peny, for I &s;hall &s;ende for the Normans, the Bernyge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the Fleminges, the cha~|penoys, the Almaynes, the Bauiers and for Engli&s;hemen, and &s;o &s;hall I goe vpon hym and &s;hall vtterly de|&s;troy hym, and Naymes &s;ayde euer vnto hym that he &s;houlde not fraye hym &s;elfe of nothynge tyll that he knewe the certentye.

Than gaue he leaue to many of hys barons and gentil men that were in his courte at that time &amp; tolde them that eche of them &s;hould go into his countrie for to make them &s;elf redy, and that they &s;hould come agayne to him the next &s;ommer. So was it doone as y^e kynge had commaunded And thus wente the barons and the gentil men from y^e courte into theyr
<PB N="viii" REF="13"> cou~trey, and by them were tydinges brought through all the landes vn|to Rome, that kynge Charlemayne made a great a&s;&s;emble of men of ar|mes, &s;o that the renome therof flou|ghe vnto the duke Benes of Aygre|mountes court, which of that other parte dyd &s;ende for his kyn&s;men and freendes, and in e&s;peciall for his bre+thern Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;ylon, and Dron of Nantuel, &s;o that they were wha~ they came together well foure &s;core thou&s;and fyghtynge men and mo, and as fayre folke as euer were &s;ene, whiche than &s;ayde I beleue yf the kynge be&s;yege the Ca&s;tell: that the wor&s;e &s;hall returne vnto hym. Than &s;ayd the Duke Benes of Ay|gremount to Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;ilon. Brother &s;ayd he be not dy&s;mayed, for I hope to hurte the kyng &s;o &s;ore yf he come vpon vs: that he &s;hal be wery of his bargayn, but let vs goe forth towarde Troy in cha~paygne and there wee &s;hall fyght wyth the kynge vygorou&s;ly. For well I wote that God &s;hall helpe vs agayn&s;t hi~. This was at the begynnyng of the moneth of Maye, and Charlemayn was at Paris, that abode after hys men that &s;hould come, for to go with a great puy&s;&s;aunce vpon the Duke Benes of Aygremount. And bode not longe that Rychard of Norma~|dy came to the kynge wyth .xxx. thou+&s;ande fyghtyng men. And of a no|ther &s;yde came to hym the Erle Guy that had wyth hym a ryght noble &amp; a great company of good men, and after hym came Salamon of Ber|tayne and the Erle Huon. And of al &s;ydes ye &s;hould haue &s;ene come to the Kynge Charlemayne Poeteui~s Ga&s;coyns, Normans, Flemynges, Bernyers, and Bourgoynes, and &s;o many other great Lordes that it was great wonder for to &s;ee, which came all and Lodged them&s;elfe in y^e medowes of &s;aynt Germayne.</P>
<P>THan whan the kyng Charle|mayne knew that this folke was all arryued: he had of it greate Ioye, and incontynent made hys ba+tayles to departe, for to goe to hys enterpry&s;e, and made of Rychard of Normandy, of Valleran of Buyl|lon, of Guydellon of bauyere, of yza+car of Nemours, of Oger the bane. and of E&s;couf the &s;onne of Oedon wyth them .xl. thou&s;ande men hys forewarde. There &s;hould ye haue &s;e~ a ryght noble companye, and manye hardi men, they departed from nigh Parys. And put them &s;elf to y^e way &s;trayght to Aygremounte, and they (th&abus; rydyng after many dayes Iur|ney whiche I can not tel) came there &s;treyght to Ogyer the Dane that was in the forewarde a me&s;&s;anger &s;ore ha&s;tyly rydynge. That a&s;ked to whome was thys noble co~pany, and he an&s;wered to hym that they were kynge Charlemaynes folke. Than &s;ayd &s;yr the me&s;&s;anger that he wolde well &s;peake wyth hym, than went Oger the Dane and &s;hewed hym the kyng. And a&s;&s;one as the me&s;&s;anger &s;aw hym: he made hym due reuere~ce, and the kyng gaue hym agayne hys &s;alute, and him demaunded what he was and fro whens he came? and y^e me&s;&s;anger tolde hym that he was of Troye and y^t vnto him he was &s;ent
<PB REF="14"> fro Aubery the lorde of Troye that was his liege man, whiche be&s;ought hym humbly for &s;ocoures. For the Duke Benes of Aygremount, &amp; his two bretherne Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;yl|lon, and Dron of Nantuel and with theim an hundred thou&s;ande figh|ting men had be&s;yeged him within Troye. And that yf ye came not to helpe hi~, he mu&s;t yelde vp the towne, al&s;o the fayre towre that Iulius Ce|&s;ar dyd buylde there.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne the Em|perour vnder&s;tode that Troi was be&s;yeged by the duke Benes &amp; his bretherne, he was full &s;ory of it and he &s;wore by Saynte Denys of Fraunce, that he &s;hould go there w^t hys army, and that yf he might hold the duke of Aygremounte he &s;hould make hym dye a &s;hamefull death, &s;o called he the Duke Naymes of ba|uyere, Goodebew of fry&s;e, and the Duke Walleran and &s;ayd to theym. Barons ye vnder&s;tande what thys me&s;&s;a~ger &s;ayth, let vs ryde ha&s;telye towarde Troy or it be take, and they an&s;wered to hym ryght gladly that they wolde doo it &s;o. So dyd they ryde a good pace tyll that they came nyghe Troye. And fir&s;te of all came the forewarde with the Oryflame. Of the whyche were gouernours Ogyer the Dane, Rycharde of Nor|mandy, &amp; the duke Walleran, and w^c them fourty thou&s;and men. And the Me&s;&s;anger of Troy that conduyted them. And whan they were come &s;o nyghe y^t they &s;awe Troye afore the~: a me&s;&s;anger came to Gerard of rou&s;+&s;yllon that was afore Troy, &s;aying to hym that the kinge Charlemayne came vpon them for to &s;ocoure Au|bery with a ryght great &amp; pui&s;&s;aunt companye. Than layde Gerarde to hys bretherne, that is to wyte Duke Benes of Aygremount, and y^e Erle Dron of Nantuell that it were good that they &s;hould go agayn&s;te kynge Charlemayne w^t all theyr pui&s;&s;au~ce and that eche of them &s;hould proue him&s;elf a good man. They did &s;o as they had deuy&s;ed, and Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;illon was the fir&s;t in the fore|warde, and they rode &s;o longe till y^t the one partye &s;aw the other. Than &s;ayd Ogier the Dane to Richard of Normandy whan he &s;awe come Ge|rarde of Rou&s;&s;illon &s;e: &s;ayd he howe Gerard of Rou&s;&s;yllon weneth for to fare foule with vs. But now let vs thynke for to defende vs wel, &s;o mo|che that the wor&s;hyp abyde to the Kyng Charlemayne and to vs. And than they let renne theyr hor&s;es fro one parte and fro the other, and Ge|rarde of Rou&s;&s;yllon wente &amp; &s;mote an Almayne wyth his &s;peare &s;o mo+che, that he made it to entre through the body of hym. Whiche fell anon dead to the ground, and Gerard to|oke his baner &amp; cryed with an high voyce Rou&s;&s;yllon Rou&s;&s;yllon.</P>
<P>THan began the batayle &s;ore &s;tronge fell and cruell. And whan Ogyer the dane &s;aw thus his folke dye; he was wood and mad with it. So went he and &s;mote a kni+ght named Pou&s;on by &s;uche a wy&s;e that he put his &s;pere thorough the body of hym whiche fel downe dead afore him. And whan Gerarde had &s;een the &s;ame: he went and &s;mote one of Ogyers men, &s;o that all dead he
<PB N="ix" REF="14"> ca&s;t him afore hym. And then he &s;aid ye haue this for your may&s;ters &s;ake Ogyer. Muche great and meruayl|lous was the &s;toure and the batayle &s;o fiers. For there &s;hould ye haue &s;e|ne &s;o many of &s;heeldes perced and clouen, and &s;o mani a habergeon bro+ken, and &s;alettes and helmes vnbo|kled and &s;ore beten, and &s;o many me~ lying vpon the other dead, that all the earth was couered with y^e bloud of the dead men (and of theym that were hurt there) &s;o y^e it was a great pitie to for to &s;ee. And than came the duke Benes of Aygremounte that &s;purred hys hor&s;e terrtblie, and we~t and &s;mote Enguerran lorde of Pe|roune &amp; of &s;aint Quintine &s;o harde that he ouerthrew him dead afore hi~ and than &s;ayd. Now go goddes cur+&s;e haue thou, and cryed with an hi|ghe voyce Aygremounte, and than came to him his brother the Duke of Nantuell with all his folke, and they went al together vpon Charle|maynes folke, and of the other part came with great pui&s;&s;aunce. Almay|nes poeteuins and Lumbardes al|&s;o y^t were of the parte of kinge Char+lemayne. So medled theym &s;elfe the one party amo~ge the other. And ther was moche harde and horryble a&s;&s;e~|ble. For there were &s;layne many mi|ghty and worthy knightes of bothe &s;ides, and Richarde of Normandye &s;hewed wel there his great prowe&s;&s;e and worthines. For he wente and &s;mote a knight y^t Gerarde of Rou&s;|&s;illon loued moche by &s;uche a &s;tren|gth that he ouerthrewe hym dead from his hor&s;e to the erth afore the &s;ayd Gerarde. Whiche than &s;ayd.</P>
<P>Now am I wel &s;ory and wrothe for hym that now is dead that I loued &s;o &s;ore, certes I &s;hal neuer haue Ioy at my hert but y^t I be auenged ther|of &s;hortlye. Than tooke Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;illon his baner in his fi&s;t. But hys brother Nantuell came anon to hym and &s;ayd, brother I cou~&s;ell you that ye tourne agayne. For here co|meth Charlemayne wyth hys folk, and well I tell you that yf wee a|byde hym: the lo&s;&s;e &s;hall tourne vp|pon vs. And whyle they were &s;pea|kynge thus: Walleran of Bollon &s;mote y^e neuew of Gerarde of Rou&s;|&s;illon &s;o that he foyned at hym, with his &s;werde through the body of hym &amp; fell downe dead to y^e earth. Than trowed Gerarde to haue gone out of his wytte, and &s;ente anon for the duke Benes his brother y^t he &s;hould come &s;oone to &s;uccoure him, and he dyd &s;o as pren and valyaunt that he was. And of the other &s;yde a&s;&s;em|bled there the kynge and hys folke.</P>
<P>&para; So &s;hal you now hear of a thing meruaylous of &s;o greate a nobles y^e at the &s;ame feeld were cruelly &s;layn. This was in the moneth of Maye vpon a mornynge that kyng Char|lemayne did a&s;&s;emble his folke with the folke of the duke of Aygremou~te and of his bretherne. To the whych a&s;&s;emble ye &s;hould haue &s;ene manye fayre harnay&s;es &s;hynynge for the Sunne that fayre and cleare was y^e day, the whyche a&s;&s;emble was wun+derfull &s;tronge. For there were &s;o many feete and heades &s;mytten of &amp; &s;o many good hor&s;es &s;layne, and the other ranne thorough the medowes wherof the may&s;ters lay dead vpon
<PB REF="15"> the gra&s;&s;e. And wyt it for trouthe y^t there were dead that &s;ame day of the one &s;yde and of the other: more than xl. thou&s;and men. A God what &s;lau|ghter, there was muche great nobles dead. The duke Benes &s;ore angred went and &s;mote &s;yr Walter Lorde of Pierrele in his &s;hielde &s;o y^t hys &s;pere went through the body of hym and fell downe dead afore hym. Than cryed he with an hye voyce his baner Aygremounte.</P>
<P>GReat was the preas, and y^e ba|tayle fyers and meruaylous. And there &s;hewed Rychard of Nor|mandy much worthili his great har|dynes. For he Iu&s;ted agayn&s;t y^e duke of Aygremou~t &s;o that he perced hys &s;heelde and dyd hurt hym right &s;ore and &s;ayd to him by God ye &s;hall not thys daye e&s;cape death. It was an euyll daye for you whan ye dyd &s;lea my Lorde Lohier, &amp; with that he did draw out his &s;werde, and &s;mote the duke agayne vpo~ his helme in &s;uch a wi&s;e that if it had not ben a coyfe of &s;teele that made his &s;troke to &s;lide the &s;aid Benes had be dead y^e houre And the &s;troke fell downe vpon the hor&s;e, &amp; cut y^e hor&s;e in two as though it had be nothing. And thus fell the hor&s;e dead vnder hys may&s;ter. Tha~ was y^e Duke Benes &s;ore aba&s;&s;hed whan he thus fou~d him &s;elf a grou~d But he &s;toode vpon his feete redely as he that was preu and valyaunte holdyng his &s;werde in his hande, &amp; went and &s;mote a knight named &s;ir Symon &s;o that he kylled hym &s;terke dead in the place. And than he called wyth an highe voyce. Aygremount his baner. Than came to hym hys two bretherne, the Duke of Rou&s;&s;il|lon and of Nantuell, and of the &s;ide of kinge Charlemayne came Ogyer Naymes, Wallera~ of Bollon, Huo~ lorde of Mauns the Erle Salamon Leon of Fri&s;e the archebi&s;&s;hop Tur+pyn and E&s;coufe the &s;onne of Oedo~ And than &s;hould ye haue &s;ene there at that a&s;&s;emble muche great &amp; mer|uayllous noble&s;&s;e of knyghtes that lay dead vpon y^e erth, the one vpon y^e other that it was a pyteous &s;yght for to beholde.</P>
<P>TO this inhumayne occy&s;ion was come the~perour Char|lemayne cryinge barons if they e&s;ca+pe vs we &s;hall neuer haue honoure, and than he bare vp his &s;pere to the re&s;t and went and &s;mote into the &s;he|elde of Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;yllon &s;o y^t he ouerthrew both hor&s;e and man to the ground, and there had be his la&s;t daye yf it had not ben the Duke Be|nes and Dron his brethern, y^t muche worthely and wyth great dylyge~ce &s;uccoured hym. Of that other party came Ogyer the Dane vpon hys good hor&s;e Broyforte that &s;mote a knyght of the folke of Gerard duke of Rou&s;&s;yllon called Syr Foulquer &s;o that he cloue him to the teeth and fell downe dead vnto the erth. And whan Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;yllon &s;awe thus hys knyght &s;layne he called to god &amp; to our lady &s;aying. Well haue I thys daye lo&s;t my fayre and good knight. And the duke of Aygremou~t was &s;ore aba&s;&s;hed and prayed God al&s;o full pyteou&s;ly y^t it wolde plea&s;e hym to kepe hym from death, and
<PB N="x" REF="15"> from fallynge in to the handes of Charlemayne. Nyghe was the &s;on|ne vnder and it was well aboute co~+plyn tyme &amp; the fyghters of the one parte &amp; of the other were voery &amp; &s;ore chauffed, And &s;o wythdrewe the thre bretherne abacke vnto theyr Tentes with moche wrathe, and in e&s;pecyal Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;yllon that had lo&s;t that day Aymanoy his co&s;yn and a hundred other of the be&s;t Knyghtes of his company. And he &s;ayd in this wy&s;e. An euyll houre it was whan the &s;onne of Charlemain was &s;lain. Than came to hym the duke Benes of Aygremou~t bledyng as he y^t was horriblie wounded. And whan Ge|rarde &s;aw hym: he began to &s;ygh te~|derly &s;ayinge. Fayre brother are ye wou~ded to death? Nay &s;ayd he I &s;hal &s;oone be whole. Than &s;wore Ge|rarde the duke of Rou&s;&s;yllon that to morow at y^e &s;onne ri&s;ing: He &s;hould begyn agayn y^e batayle again&s;t king Charlemayne and hys folke wher|fore thyrty thou&s;ande &s;hal lo&s;e their lyues. Alas for god nay &s;ayd his bro+ther the Duke Nantuell. But yf ye wyll doo my coun&s;ell we &s;hall &s;ende xxx. of the wy&s;e&s;t knightes that wee haue vnto kynge Charlemayne, and by our &s;ayd knyghtes we &s;hall doo hym to wyt and &s;hew hu~bli y^t he haue pitie and mercy of vs, and that the Duke Benes our brother &s;hall a|mende hym the death of hys &s;onne Lohier euen &s;o as it &s;halbe aduy&s;ed by the prynces &amp; barons of hys fe|law&s;hyp and of ours, &amp; ye know wel all redy y^t we ben hys lyege men, &amp; y^t for to warre agayn&s;t hym we doo cruel fal&s;hed, &amp; yet more it is, that yf he had lo&s;te all his folke that he hath here with him, or euer y^t it were a mo+neth pa&s;&s;ed he &s;hould haue recouered twy&s;e as many, &s;o may we nothing doo agayn&s;t hym. And therfore may we nothyng doo again&s;t him, &amp; ther|fore I pray you my brethern, that ye wyll doo thus, &amp; to hym an&s;wered his two bretherne that they wolde doo it, &s;yn that he coun&s;elled the~ &s;o, and co~cluded together y^t they &s;hould &s;ende thyther as &s;oone as it were day. They made that nyght good watche vnto the morning, and than they made redi their me&s;&s;angers for to &s;ende to the kyng Charlemayne, And whan they were redy: Gerarde of Rou&s;&s;yllon &s;ayd to them. Lordes &s;ay wel to kynge Charlemayne that we be &s;ore dy&s;plea&s;ed of the death of hys &s;onne Lohier. and y^t our brother the duke Benes repenteth him &s;elfe of it full &s;ore, &amp; that yf it plea&s;e hym to haue mercy of vs that we &s;hal go &amp; &s;erue hym where it &s;hal plea&s;e him to &s;ende vs wyth .x. thou&s;and fygh|tynge men. And al&s;o ye &s;hall &s;aye to Naymes of Bauyere that we pray hym y^t he wyll enploy hym&s;elfe to|warde the kyng Charlemayne that this accorde may be had.</P>
<P>AFter that the me&s;&s;a~gers had well all alonge vnder&s;tand what they &s;hould &s;aye to the Kynge Charlemaine from y^e three brethern dukes: They lyghted on hor&s;backe eche of them, berynge braunches of Olyue tree in their handes, in token of peace. And cea&s;ed not to ryde tyll that they were come afore y^e tente of the kinge charlemayne. Than &s;pake

And of this right hu~bly they be&s;eche you.</P>
<P>WHan the kynge Charlemayne had thus heard &s;peake y^e me&s;|&s;angers of the three brethern: He fro~ peled his forehead, &amp; knitted his bro+wes, and looked full angrely, and at that houre he an&s;wered to them no|thynge, and than &s;oone after he bega~ to &s;peake in this maner. Bi my fai|th &s;yr Steuen &s;ayde he well had the duke Benes lo&s;t his wittes whan he &s;o &s;hamfully &s;lew my deere &s;onne Lohier, whiche I loued &s;o tenderly. Now is he my man wyll he or not.

<P>Than &s;ayd the kinge of this we &s;hal coun&s;eyll vs, and withdrewe hym a lytle a &s;ide, and called to him duke Naymes. Ogyer the Dane, &s;yr Sa|lamon. Huon of Mauns. Walleran of Bollon.

So coun&s;ell I you that ye pardon them. For they be muche valyaunte, and of great renome.</P>
<P>Wherfore pardon them yf it plea&s;e you.</P>
<P>THan by the Coun&s;ell of the Duke Naymys of Bauyere the kynge dyd pardon the three bre|therne &amp; called to him the .iii. knigh|tes, and &s;aid to them, how he pardo|ned the three dukes the death of his &s;onne Lohier, by &s;uche a condicion that the duke Benes of Aygremou~t &s;hould come for to &s;erue hym at the fea&s;t of Saynt Iohn next comynge wyth .x. thou&s;and fyghtyng men wel arayed, and ye &s;hall tel to them that they &s;urely come nowe to me for to take of theym theyr othe and fayth that they &s;hall fro hens forthe, obey and &s;erue truly.

So tooke y^e noble knyghtes their clothes of, and al naked bare foote and in poore e&s;tate departed from theyr lodges, and well foure thou|&s;ande knightes wyth them all bare fote and in their &s;hertes, and in &s;uch e&s;tate as were theyr may&s;ters.

And wyt wel that in right great humilitie were &s;et the three bretherne for to haue peace and accorde wyth the kyng Charlemain that was wroth to them &s;pecyally to the Duke of Aygremount as more playnlye ye &s;hall heare here after.</P>
<P>WHan the kynge Charlemayn &s;awe thus come y^e three bre|therne wyth theyr barons &amp; knygh|tes: he called to hym the duke Nay|mes &amp; many other barons, and &s;ayd to the~, can ye not tell me what folke ye &s;ee yonder comyng?

<P>Than whan the kynge &s;awe theym thus come humblie towarde hys pre&s;ence in theyr &s;hertes &amp; barefoote and had hearde this that the Duke of Aygremount had &s;ayd to hym: he had of them ryght great pitie, &amp; par|doned them the death of his Sonne Lohier and all his euyll wyll.

<P>HYers was the bataile &amp; right harde to endure, but well ye may wyt y^t the duke of Aygremou~t myght not re&s;y&s;te agayn&s;t &s;o manye folke. For he had not with him but two hundred knyghtes, and the o|ther were more than foure thou&s;and thus were they euyll matched.

For after many chyrches many townes and Ca&s;tel|les were therfore &s;et in a fyre, and &s;o many great nobles full pyteou&s;lye brought to death. So much &s;ped the traytour Guenes agayn&s;t the good duke of Aygremount that the folke of the duke were weke &amp; almo&s;t go~. For of two hu~dred y^t he had brought he had no moe with hym, but fourty Barons: &s;ayd y^e duke Benes of ay|gremount ye &s;e that we ben almo&s;te all dead yf we defende vs not wyth great herte and worthynes.

Thys was at the fea&s;te of Pentheco&s;te after the holy thur&s;daye, that the king Charle|mayne helde a great court at Parys, after that he hadde accorded with the bretherne of the &s;aide duke Benes of Aygremou~t.

No more we &s;hal &s;aide duke Aimon, but wel I pray god to haue mercye of his &s;oule, for he was a right wor|thy knight. The~ came forth Reinaw+de, Alard, Guychard, and Richarde, which rea&s;oned with the kinge, &s;ay|ing in this maner. Sir &s;aid Reinaw|de the faire&s;t of al knights and mo&s;te expert in faites of knighthode, ye ha|ue made me &amp; my brethern that been now afore you knightes, but wit it for very certain that we loue you not &amp; that we haue toward you a greate and a mortall hate for the deathe of our vncle the duke Benes of Aygre|mount, of the whiche deathe ye haue not accorded with vs. Whan the king vnder&s;toode Reinawde: he looked

<P>THus lefte the foure &s;onnes of Aimon the debate and &s;pake no more to the kyng Charlemayn for that tyme of this matter. Fayre was the courte, and the day was ful fayre and bryghte, and fayre was y^e companye as of .xv. kinges .xxx. du|kes, and .lx. erles. They went to the chirch for to heare y^e faire ma&s;&s;e that was &s;onge, and muche rych was the offeryng. And whan they had hearde the ma&s;&s;e: they came agayn to the pa|lays, and a&s;ked after water for to wa&s;he theyr handes, and the dyner was readye, &s;o they wa&s;hed and &s;et theym downe to dyner. And the .xv. kynges were all &s;et, except the king Salamon that &s;erued that daye with the Duke Godfraye. But Reynaw|de at thys dynner myght not eat by cau&s;e that the kynge Charlemayne had rebuked hym &s;o &s;hamefully.

I &s;hal wexe mad. In this wi&s;e &s;orowed the good Reinawd, and his brethern re|comforted him. The baro~s came out after diner for to play &amp; &s;porte theym &s;elfe, and Berthelot the neuewe of Charlemayn called Reynawd for to play with him, wherof grew a great mi&s;cheef for afterward many a good knight died therfore &amp; manye a fayre childe fatherles as here after ye &s;hal herken well.</P>
<P>NOwe was &s;et Berthelot and the worthy Reynawde for to playe at the ches whiche were of y|uory, wherof the boord was of golde ma&s;&s;y, and &s;o longe they played that debate fel betwene them two, by &s;uch maner that berthelot called Reinaw|de hor&s;onne, and tooke vp his hand, and &s;mote Reynawde in the vy&s;age &s;o that the bloud fell to the grounde, and whan Reynawde &s;awe him&s;elf thus &s;hamefully outeraged: he was ryght wroth and &s;ore angred &amp; &s;ware by god him &s;hould yl betyde therfore. Tha~ tooke Reinawd the ches boord and &s;mote Berthelot vpon his head &s;o harde that he cloued hym to the teeth, and thus Berthelot fell down deade to the grounde afore hym, &s;o be+gan the crye at that houre &s;ore &s;trong in the Palays that Reynawde y^e &s;on|ne of Aimon had &s;lain Berthelot the neuewe of kyng Charlemayn. Whan the kynge vnder&s;toode thys: he went nyghe oute of his wyt, and cal|led of heyghte. Barons keep well that Reinawd &s;cape not. For by &s;aint
<PB N="xv" REF="20"> Denis of Fraunce: he &s;hall not e&s;ca|pe quicke yf we maye holde hym, for he hath &s;laine our neuew Berthelor. Than ran &s;oone the knightes vpon Reinawde.

For &s;uche a fray was there neuer &s;een as that daye was in the palays of Pa|rys. Many &s;trokes gaue there Maw+gys the co&s;in of Reinawd, and &s;onne to the duke Benes of Aygremount.

<P>ANd whan themperour Char|lemaine wy&s;t that Reinawd and his bretherne were gone oute of Parys: he made for to be redy wel two thou&s;and knightes for to folow them.

For he was vpon his hor&s;e bayard that goeth as the wynde. So taryed not the foure brethern &amp; theyr co&s;yn tyll that they came vnto Sawmore, and they bay|red theyr hor&s;es of Alarde, Richard and of Guycharde. Thanne began Reynawde to make &s;orowe &s;ayinge. Fayre god that &s;uffred deathe and pa&s;&s;yon, keep thys daye my brethern and my co&s;yn from the deathe, and from combraunce, and from fallinge in the handes of Charlemayne the cruell, and of the other parte cha&s;ed them the frenchemen brochyng with the &s;purres as fa&s;t as theyr hor&s;es myght renne, &s;o muche that a knight that was better hor&s;ed then the other were: ouertooke Reynawde and &s;ayd to hym, ye &s;hall abyde ye vntrue knyghte and I &s;hall brynge you to kinge Charlemayne. And whan Reinawde heard hym: he turned bay|arde ayen&s;t hym and &s;mot the knyght with his &s;pere in his &s;heeld, &amp; rought him with &s;o great a might that &s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ke deade he ouerthrewe him. So &s;ea&s;ed Reinawde the knyghtes hor&s;e and tooke him to his brother Alarde that lyghted anon vpon the backe of him. And after that he was on this good hor&s;e: he went &amp; &s;mote a nother kny|ght with his &s;werd &s;o that he made him fall deade afore him, and &s;o be|tooke this knightes hor&s;e to his bro|ther Guicharde that thanked hym muche for it.

<P>WHan the emperour Charlemai|ne vnder&s;tood this an&s;were: he was &s;o &s;ore an angred that he went almo&s;t oute of his wyt, and tha~ he commau~ded that the ca&s;tel &s;hould be a&s;&s;ayled to the whiche they &s;awe but three gates. Wherof was &s;et afo|re the may&s;ters gate, their Reiner, &amp; Folques of Morylion, the earle of Neuers, and Ogier the dane.

For he &s;ayde to his folke fairelordes I pray you that ye mounte not vpon youre hor&s;e tyl that ye heare the trompet|tes blowe. For I &s;ee wel that Char|lemaines folke ben right &s;ore trauai|led, and nowe while they been thus wery: it were no wor&s;hip to vs for to tenne them vpon, but wha~ they &s;hal be a litill ca&s;ed of their wyrenes: we &s;hall thanne make dyligentlye and worthely our fir&s;t y&s;&s;ue vpon them, and I praye you and require you all in general, that euery man &s;hew than his prowe&s;&s;e and &s;trength, and wyt it that in the ca&s;tell of Mountenford was a faucebray vpon a roche, tho|rough the which Reinawd and hys brethern went out vnder couerte at all tymes that they wolde withoute daunger.</P>
<P>wHan Reynawd &s;aw that it was time fo to goe oute vpon their enmies: he cal|led to him Samp&s;on of bourdelloys, this was a knight a tru&s;ty man that was come there for to help Reynaw|de and his bretherne, and hadde with him an hundred knightes, Reynawd &s;aid to him, &s;it it is nowe tyme that our cumies know what we been, for if we tary lenger: the kinge Charle|main mought wit vs of cowardnes, And whan he had &s;aid the&s;e wordes: he came to his brother Guicharde, &amp; &s;aide to him.

Reynawde &s;aid Ogier the Dane ye &s;ay wel and wi&s;e+ly, &amp; I promyt you I &s;hall &s;hew the &s;ame to the kinge as ye haue &s;ayd, &amp; yf ye will beleue my cou~&s;ell: I en&s;ure you I &s;hall tell hym that ye doo &s;o for ye are not folke for to be &s;et lytel by thus, nor for to be for the courte, for yf the kinge had you nyghe him, he &s;oulde be the better for it.</P>
<P>ALl thus as Reynawde &amp; O|gier &s;pake together, there ca|me Forques of Morillon that cried to Reynawde va&s;&s;ayle yee be but a tool, for certes I haue heard youre wordes well, ye &s;hall leue vs Mou~|taynforde for it is not your herytage and your heades in lykewy&s;e, Foul|ques &s;ayd Reynawde ye haue repre|ued me full often. I know well all y^e harme y^t the Emperour Charlemain wyll to me, is becau&s;e I haue &s;layne Berthelot his neuew with a Che&s;&s;e borde of whome god haue mercye.</P>
<P>Certes I could not doo therto, but I was full &s;ory for it god wot it, It is trouth whan we played together we had &s;ome wordes, by whyche with|out any wordes he gaue me &s;uche a &s;troke vpon my face that the bloud ranne downe at the grou~d. And wha~ I &s;aw my &s;elfe &s;o armed. I myght not be &s;o &s;oft that I could endure y^e great ontrage that he had doone to me with out a cau&s;e. So defended I my &s;elfe to my power. For who let|teth hym &s;elfe to be &s;layne his &s;oule &s;hal neuer haue pardon. And thou knowe&s;t wel Foulques y^e I dyd was in my defe~dyng. But to this mu&s;t be made &s;horte wordes, and if it plea&s;e you, ye &s;hal tel to y^e king charlemain that he taketh vs to mercy, and that we may be freendes. And yf ye doo thys: ye &s;hall doo your honoure.</P>
<P>For as &s;oone may ye be &s;layne there as a nother. Than &s;ayde Foulques by god all thys is nought worth vn|to

And whanne Reynawde had &s;ayd the&s;e wordes: they wente agayne to theyr pauyly|ons. And thus abode the ho&s;te vnto than without any fyghtyng, but the frechemen came agayn wolde they or not, wherfore the kynge Charle|mayne was wrothe.</P>
<P>THan the Emperour Charle|mayne &s;ent for men through all hys lande, and whan they were all come: he &s;ayd to them.

And Mountaynforde is &s;o &s;tronge: y^t bi &s;trength it can neuer be taken, but by famy&s;|&s;hyng. Now tell me what I ought to doo? for I &s;hall doo therin your coun&s;ell, whan the barons heard the complaynt that the kynge made to them of the foure &s;onnes of Aymo~: there was none &s;o hardy y^e dur&s;t &s;ay a worde, but y^e duke Naymes of Ba+uiere that &s;ayd to the king. Syr em|perour yf ye wyll haue good cou~&s;el: I &s;hall gyue you good, yf ye wyl be|leue me. Let vs retourne nto hyghe Fraunce, for we be to nighe the win+ter for to make warre. And whan y^t newe tyme &s;halbe come: ye &s;hal mow come agayne to lay your &s;yege afore Mountaynforde. For I doo you to vnder&s;tond y^t Reynawde is not &s;ore pre&s;ed, but that he goeth in wodes &amp; in riuers at all tymes that he wyl. And a man that may goe out and in at his wil: is not ouer &s;ore be&s;ieged. And of the other parte Reynawde and hys bretherne are &s;uche knygh|tes that they &s;hall not be lyghtly o|uercome.

<P>THen &s;pake Hornier of Sauey+ne, and to him &s;aid, &s;yr I &s;hal gyue you a better coun&s;ell yf ye wil beleue me, gyue me the ca&s;tell and al the hauoyre that is with in and the Lord&s;hyp fyue myles aboute it: and I &s;hall yelde to you Reynawde and al his brethern for pry&s;oners afore a moneth cum to an ende.

But knowe you that Hernyer dyd my&s;&s;e of his enterpry&s;e, for he kept not couenaunt to the kynge as he had promi&s;ed him: for Reinawde tooke hym and made hym to be he|wen all in peces, and made all they that were wyth hym whan he made the trea&s;on to be hanged and &s;layne, as more playnly ye &s;hall vnder&s;tand here after, yf that ye ly&s;te to harken.</P>

<P>HErnier of Saueyn made none other taryenge, but he &s;ayd to kyng Charlemayne in this maner.</P>
<P>Syr co~maunde ye Guyon of Bour|gone that he doo put in array a thou+&s;and knightes well armed, and that to morrow afore the day he goe vpon the mou~tayne fayre and &s;oftly with out noy&s;e, &amp; I &s;hall put hym within the ca&s;tell &s;hortly. Whan he had &s;ayd this: he went to hys tente, &amp; made hi~+&s;elfe to be armed. And whan he was armed: he lyghted a hor&s;backe, and rode to the gate of the ca&s;tell, &amp; &s;ayd to them that kepte warde. Alas for god fayre lordes haue mercye of me if it plea&s;e you let me in, or els I am but dead, for the Emperour Charle|mayne maketh to folow and &s;eke me all aboute, for to make me dye by+cau&s;e I haue &s;aid to him much good of Reynawde, &amp; al&s;o I tell you wel y^t I &s;hall &s;hew to Reynawde a thing wherof he &s;hall he ryght glad yf hys plea&s;ure is to heare me.</P>
<P>WHan they y^t were aboue v+pon y^e gate heard hi~ &s;peak thus they without lo~g ta|ryeng let goe downe the draw bridge and made him come in, &amp; dy&s;aimed him &amp; did to him great honour. But the fal&s;e traytour rewarded the~ full yll for it after that. This hangyng: Charlemayne commaunded Guion to make him redy, &amp; a thou&s;and kni|ghtes with him, and &s;ent them vpon the hylle, without makyng of anye bruyte tyll that the day were come.</P>
<P>And wyt that Guyon had wyth hym of the be&s;t Knyghtes of Charle|mayne.</P>
<P>NOw is Harnyer y^e traytour within the ca&s;tell of Moun|taynforde, vnto whome men made good cheere. And whan Reynawde wy&s;te that a knight of Charlemayn was come: He &s;ayde that he wolde &s;peake w^t hym. And &s;o he was brou|ght afore hym. And whan he &s;awe him: he &s;ayd to hi~. What be you fayre knighte that are come hither? And he an&s;wered, &s;yr my name is Her|nier of Saueyne, &amp; I haue angred kinge Charlemayne for the loue of you and for this cau&s;e I am com hi|ther praying that ye haue me for re|commau~ded, for I wot not whether to goe nowe.

<P>For of &s;uche goodes that God hath &s;ent me ye &s;hall not fayle. Now tell me I pray you how doth the ho&s;te of the Emperour? Haue they anye great plentie fo vytayles. Syr &s;ayd Hernyer they ben &s;car&s;e wyth them. But I tell for very certayne y^t they &s;hall goe theyr wayts within the&s;e fourty dayes, for none of the baro~s wyll no lenger abyde there. Where|fore the kyng Charlemayne is &s;ore an angred with them. And I promit you yf the ho&s;te wente awaye ye mi|ght hurte theym ryght verye &s;ore, and gette verye muche good, yf ye wyll &s;ette then vpon the tayle of them. Freende &s;ayde Reynawde to hym, ye haue comforted me ryght well, yf it is &s;o as ye &s;ay, For yf the king Charlemayne be once ouerthro+wen: he &s;hall not come a nother ty|me vpon vs wyth &s;o good a wyll as he dooth nowe. And then Rey|nawde
<PB REF="30"> had hym wyth hym to hys brethern, that made vnto hym good cheere. And whan the &s;upper was redy: Reynawde and his bretherne &s;et the~ downe vnto theyr meat and &s;upped gladly. And in theyr compa|nye was the traytour Hernier, vnto whom they made good cheere. After &s;upper all the knyghtes wente to &s;lepe. For they were wery of beari~g of theyr Harneys, and they had not cea&s;ed to fyght all that day. And wit that Hernier was well and hone&s;t|ly brought to bed. For Reynawde had &s;o commaunded. And whan all the knyghtes were fa&s;t a &s;lepe: Her|nier as the fal&s;e Iudas &s;lepte not.</P>
<P>But he ro&s;e and tooke hys harneys and armed hym &s;elfe. And whan he was well armed at his ea&s;e: he came to the drawe bridge, and cut the cor|des that kept it vp, and let the draw brydge go downe, and than he went vpon the walles where he found him that made the watche and &s;lew him. And wha~ he had doone this: he came to the gate and opened it. For he had taken the keyes from hym that he had &s;layne, whyche had them in his kepyng.</P>
<P>THan whan Guyon of Bour|goyne &s;aw the gate open: he made no tarying, but came and en|tred into the ca&s;tell, and al hys folke with hym. And began to kylle and flea all the~ that they found. &para; Now &s;hall ye heare of the fayre aduenture how that Reynawde &amp; his brethern were &s;aued from this mortall &s;law|ghter. Wyt that whan the yemen of the &s;table had &s;upped: thei were dro~ke and went to theyr bed, &amp; whan they were a &s;lepe: the hor&s;e of Alarde y^t was &s;o~what proude began to make noy&s;e agayn&s;t the other. And Alarde and Richarde heard the noy&s;e of the hor&s;es, they ro&s;e vp and &s;aw y^e doore of the halle open, and perceyued out of it the harneys y^t gly&s;tered agayn&s;t the moone that &s;hone full bryght.</P>
<P>Than went they to the bedde where they had brought the fal&s;e Hernyer, whyche they fou~d not there. Whereof they were ryght &s;ore aba&s;&s;hed. And than was Reynawde awaked, and a&s;ked who was there that maketh thys noy&s;e. Let our knyghtes take theyr re&s;t, that haue &s;o &s;ore trauay|led all the day it is euyl doone for to go thus &s;tampyng at this houre, tha~ cryed Alarde to Reinawde and &s;ayd. Fayre brother we ben betrayed, for Hernyer that fal&s;e knyght hath put the folke of Charlemayne within thys ca&s;tell, the whiche kyll and &s;lea your folke and put them to a greate matter, whan Reynawde vnde&s;tode this: he made no taryi~g, but he aro&s;e and armed hym&s;elf quickly, and cri|ed vnto his brethern and to his men, Now my freendes let vs beare our &s;elfe worthy, we had neuer &s;o great need, any wyt that Reynawde had w^t hym but .xxx. Knyghtes within the dongeon of that fortre&s;&s;e, for al the other were within y^e ba&s;e courte whi|che was as it had ben a lytle towne well peopled, where as Guyon of Bourgoyne &amp; his folke &s;lew them.</P>
<P>This hanging: Reynawde &amp; his bre|thern had armed them&s;elfe right wel hopynge for to defende theym&s;elfe well.</P>
<PB N="xxv" REF="30">
<P>THan came Hernyer the tray|tour &s;teryng about throughe the may&s;tres &s;trete &amp; with him well an hundred knightes. Tha~ &s;ayd Rei+nawde to hys brethern, fayre Lor|des come forth, for yf god helpe vs not: we are all lo&s;t, &amp; than Reynawde and his brethern came to the gate, &amp; defended &s;o well y^e none dur&s;t pa&s;&s;e but he was &s;layne, what &s;hall I tell you more? the ba&s;e courte began to be &s;ore moued, and the erye was &s;o great, for al them of the dongeon de|fended them&s;elfe valyantlye. Whan the folke of the Emperour Charle|mayne &s;awe that they that were w^t|in the dongeon defended them&s;elfe &s;o well: they &s;et y^e ba&s;e court in a fire and began to brenne, and pul down the hou&s;es and al that they founde. And y^e fyre was &s;oone &s;o great that it tooke the dongeon of the ca&s;tell.</P>
<P>Whan Reynawde &s;aw that he was &s;o taken wyth fyre: he was &s;ore an|gred and &s;ayd to hys brethern what &s;hall we doo here? for yf we tary any lenger we &s;hall all be brent or taken and yf it were not the fyre that thus warreth agayn&s;t vs: I make myne a uowe to god that we &s;hould yet ca&s;te this folke out of thys ca&s;tell, but &s;yn that the fyre is in it: we cannot kepe it no lenger. And than he &s;ayd to his bretherne, come all after me &amp; they went to the fau&s;ebray that was all wayes open, and y&s;&s;ued out he &amp; his brethern &amp; his folke with them, and whan they were out: than were they more aba&s;&s;hed than they were afore for they wy&s;t not whether to goe.</P>
<P>Now heare how they dyd as wor|thy knightes. For wha~ they &s;aw the ca&s;tell brenne: they entred wythin a pyt that was there vnder the erthe, for feare of the fyre &amp; &s;et the dore vp|on them, &amp; there they began to defe~d them&s;elfe &s;o &s;trongly: that none en|tred therein but he lo&s;t anon hys head. And whan Hernyer the tray|tour was aware of y^e &s;ame: he tooke his folke with him &amp; came to y^e pyt &amp; began to a&s;&s;ayle Reynawde &s;harp|ly and his brethern, and al they that were therin with them, &amp; wyt it that there at thentre of the &s;ayd pyt were made great faytes of armes for they of within defended them&s;elf &s;o wel: y^t none myght come in but he were dead anon. &para; Whyle that the foure &s;onnes of Aymon were in y^t pyt vn|der therthe: they hearde the crye that his men made, the whiche Hernyer made to be &s;layne. Than began Rey|nawde to &s;ai to his brethern. Lordes let vs go &s;uccour our folke, for and they &s;hould thus dye: it were to vs a great blame. Syr &s;ayd hys bretherne goe in goddes name whan it plea&s;e you, and whan they were come out of the pitte: the batayle began to be there ful terryble, for ye &s;hould haue &s;een Reynawde &amp; his brethern gyue there great &s;trokes and manye. For Reynawde &s;mote &s;o merueyllou&s;e &s;trokes wyth hys &s;werd Flamberge the whyche did cut al that he rought. For Reynawde was all wrothe, and for great angre he habandoned and Ieoparded both lyfe and gooddes.</P>
<P>And therefore he bare greate hurte and harme to hys enemyes, For he had ca&s;t hys Sheelde ouer hys backe, and helde his &s;werde Flam|berge wyth both his handes &amp; made
<PB REF="31"> &s;o great de&s;truccion of the folke of Charlemaine: that the place was al full of bloud. And whan Reynawde &s;aw that theyr enemyes were &s;ore a|ba&s;&s;hed, and that they dur&s;te not a|byde him: he &s;ayd to his brethern. It was to vs great cowardnes to hyde vs &s;o. Syr &s;ayd Alarde ye &s;ay trou|the. Than &s;ayd Reynawde. My Lor|des my brethern let vs to doo well. For traitours ben good to ouercom they &s;hall not now endure longe a|gayn&s;t vs. And whan he had &s;ayde the&s;e wordes: he came to y^t gate of y^e ca&s;tel, and the fyre was a lytle quen|ched, and maugre al his enemyes he &s;hee the gate of that doungeon, and had vp the draw bridge of the &s;ayde ca&s;tel. And wha~ he had doone this: he came agayne to the batayle, &amp; found his brethern that &s;lewe and beate downe &s;o many knyghtes, and bare them&s;elfe &s;o worthelye: that it was maruayle for to &s;ee. For they &s;mote no &s;troke, but they &s;lew a man.</P>
<P>THan was Hernyer the tray|tour in the medle within the doungeon, whereof Reynawde had locked the gate, and drawen the brid+ge, and the good Reynawde &s;aw that he was &s;afe of the ho&s;te of Charle|mayne, and began to put hym&s;elfe in the medle &s;o &s;harpely that he dyd &s;o muche he and hys brethern: that of y^e folke of Charlemayne that we|re wythin the dou~geon abode of the~ aliue but Hernier and .xii. other, and whan Reynawde &s;aw that they we|re all dead: he and hys bretherne and hys folke tooke Hernyer and the .xii other. And than Reynawde did doo make agybet vpon one of the hygh|e&s;t towres, and there he made to be hanged the .xii. men. And made Her|nier to be bound his foure membres that is to wyt, feete and handes to foure hor&s;e tayles. And &s;o he was drawen all quicke and quartered in foure peeces, as a traytour ought to be doone vnto. And whan Hernier was dead: Reynawde dyd make a great fyre, and made hym to be ca&s;t therein, and as he was al together brent: he made the a&s;&s;hes of hym to be ca&s;t in the ayre to the wynde.</P>
<P>&para; And heere ye may &s;ee how the tray+tours that wolde betraye Reynawde were dead and &s;layne. For they were puny&s;&s;hed as they had de&s;erued.</P>
<P>THan whan king Charlemayne wy&s;t that his folke were thus dead, and y^t he &s;hould not haue Reynawde nor his brethern: he was &s;ore angry therfore, and &s;ayd to him &s;elfe. Ha good God lorde how am I euyll dealed wythall by this foure knyghtes bretherne, I dyd my &s;elfe great harme, whan euer I made the~ knyghtes. And it is often &s;ayd, that men make often a rod for them &s;elf. And that I may well nowe take to me. For theyr vncle &s;lewe my &s;onne Lohyer, and Reynawde my neuewe Berthelot that I loued &s;o deerelye, and yet nowe he hath hanged my men and many of them &s;layne. Well I myght call my &s;elfe vnhappye, whan I that am the mo&s;te puy&s;&s;au~t of the worlde, cannot auenge me of the foure &s;ymple knyghtes. I &s;hall
<PB N="xxvi" REF="31"> neuer departe from hens till that I be auenged, or els they &s;hal ouercom+me, and all mine armye. Syr &s;ayde Folques of Morillo~ ye haue a good cau&s;e why, and Reynawde is a foole that he fereth you not. For if he had doubted you: he &s;hould not haue han+ged your men, but he hath doone &s;o in di&s;pyte of you. Tha~ &s;ayd y^e Duke Naymes of banyer, had ye beleued me: ye &s;hould not haue lo&s;t your men ye wolde beleue Hernier, it is hap|ped of it as ye &s;ee. Now beholde your folke y^e ben &s;haking with the winde.</P>
<P>ANd whan the~perour Char|lemayne vnder&s;toode this y^t the duke Naymes &s;ayde to hym: He knew that he &s;ayd trouth, and wy&s;te not what he &s;hould &s;ay to it, but loo|ked downe all a&s;hamed. This han|ging: Reynawde &amp; hys brethern are gone vpon the walles, and looked a|boute them and &s;awe that the ba&s;e courte of the ca&s;tell brenned there as their vitailes were. Then began rey+nawde to &s;ay to his bretherne, fayre lordes the thinge goeth well, &s;yth y^t we ben &s;cape thanked be god from &s;o perillous and harde auenture. It lacked lytle but that we were al dead by fal&s;e trea&s;on, but the wor&s;te that I &s;ee: is that we haue lo&s;te our &s;tore of vitayles &s;o that we haue nothing to liue vpon, and me &s;emeth that yf we dwell anye lenger heere within: we doone not wy&s;ely. But yf it &s;eme you good, it is tyme that we departe hence. Brother &s;aid Alarde, ye &s;peke well and wy&s;ely, and we &s;hall doo as ye haue &s;ayde. For as longe as the lyfe is in our bodyes: wee &s;hall not leue you. Whan y^e foure brethern were together accorded for to depart thens: they tru&s;&s;ed al theyr harneys, and taryed tyl that it was night, and than they armed them&s;elf, &amp; lyghted on hor&s;ebacke, And whan they were redy: Reynawde &s;ayde to them, Lor|des how many men ben we? We ben an&s;wered Alard well .v. hundred, It is ynough &s;ayd Reynawde. But wot ye what we &s;hal doo? let vs keep our&s;elfes alwayes together without makynge of anye affraye and &s;o goe thorough the lande of Almayne, and yf the folke of Charlemayne hap to a&s;&s;ayle vs: thynke to defende our&s;elf well and &s;myte harde vpon them &s;o that we haue to our wor&s;hip the bet|ter of them, whan it was tyme to li|ght on hor&s;ebacke: Reynawde mou~|ted vpon Gayarde, and the other al|&s;o lyghted vpon theyr hor&s;es. And whan they were all hor&s;ed: they ope|ned the gate, and wente out at theyr ley&s;er wythout makynge any noy&s;e. And whan they were all y&s;&s;ued out: Reynawde behelde and &s;aw the ca&s;|tell y^e brente, wherof he tooke greate pitie, and &s;ayd. Ha god good ca&s;tel it is great domage that ye be thus di&s;|troied and wa&s;ted, goddes cur&s;e haue he that betrayed this good ca&s;tel. It is a goe &s;euen yere that ye were made fyr&s;te. Alas we haue had there in &s;o muche good and &s;o mykyl wor&s;hyp: and nowe we leue you mawgre vs. Certes ye were my tru&s;te after my brethern.

<P>THan whan Charlemayne kne+we we that Reynawde came: he was muche wrothe, &amp; made his co~|mau~demente that euery man &s;hould be armed, &amp; than the ho&s;te began to moue and went incontinent and armed them&s;elfe. whan Alarde and Guycharde that wente afore &s;awe that they myght not pa&s;&s;e, but that they mu&s;t medle: they &s;purred their hor&s;es &amp; ranne vpon Charlemayns folke &s;o &s;harpely that they were all an angred with it, for thei ouerthrew two knightes to the grounde and in continent was there greate a doo.</P>
<P>And whan Reynawde &s;awe that the ho&s;te moued: he called to hym twen|ty knyghtes and bad them take and lede foorthe the caryage afore out
<PB N="xxvii" REF="32"> of the ho&s;te, &amp; he &s;hould go helpe hys bretherne, &s;yr &s;ayd they we &s;hall doo your commaundemente. And than Reynawde &s;purred Bayarde and en+tred amonge y^e thicke&s;t, and began there to make &s;o great meruayles of armes that all the folke of Charle|maine wondred vpon, for he and his bretherne ouerthrew there dead &s;o many knightes that none dur&s;t com afore them, but he was &s;layne.</P>
<P>&para; What &s;hall I tell you? wyt it that the folke of king Charlemayne was &s;o di&s;co~fited for bicau&s;e that it was nyght, and myght not well &s;ee what nombre of folke the foure bretherne were, that Reynawde and hys com|pany pa&s;&s;ed mawgre them of y^e ho&s;te And al&s;o I tel you for certayne that Reynawde and hys brethern dyd &s;o great harme to the folke of Charle|mayne: that he was &s;ory for it mani dayes after. whan Reynawde was pa&s;&s;ed: he fou~d his &s;ommers and his caryage, and his Knightes that con+duyte them, wherof he was glad.</P>
<P>Tha~ he &s;ayde to his brethern. Syrs go on your waye, and they dyd hys commaundement, and Reynawde wyth his brother Rycharde abode behynde, and whan Charlemayne wy&s;te that Reynawde went a way: he was glad by cau&s;e he had left the Ca&s;tell of Mountaynforde, and in|continent he made hym to be folo|wed, and al&s;o the ho&s;te was redelye armed, and whan they were well a|rayed: they tooke theyr way after the foure &s;onnes of Aymon.</P>
<P>NOw ben the foure knyghtes bretherne ryght &s;ory of that they haue thus left theyr fayre ca&s;tel of Mountaynforde, and wit it that Charlemayne folowed them well of nyghe, and &s;ayd that it &s;hould hurt him &s;ore, but yf he might take them. But Reynawde the worthy knyght is not aba&s;&s;hed, but he taketh all his folke and &s;etteth them afore hym, &amp; &s;ayde to hys brother Alarde, Good brother Alarde, take kepe of thys folke betwene you and Guicharde, and yf the folke of Charlemayne a&s;|&s;ayle vs: we &s;hal defe~d vs wel. Syr &s;ayd Alarde as ye haue &s;ayd: &s;o &s;hall it be doone. And than they &s;aw come Charlemayne and Ogyer the Dane the duke Naymes of bauiere, Foul|ques of Moryllon, and many other and whan Charlemayne that came afore well hor&s;ed &s;aw Reynawde &amp; his folke: he cryed to them and &s;ayde So helpe me god glotons ye be now dead, this is the day y^t I &s;hall make you all foure to be all hanged. Syr an&s;wered Reynawde it &s;hall not be &s;o as ye wene, and it plea&s;e God, for yf god gyue me lyfe and health, and to my hor&s;e Bayarde, the pur&s;ucte &s;hall &s;ore dere be bought y^t ye nowe doo. And whan he had &s;ayd the &s;ame he turned Bayarde agayn&s;t Charle|mayne for to &s;mite him. For he we~de well to haue &s;layne him wythout a|ny faute. The kynge Charlemayne was in daunger to dye yf Reynawde had raught hym, but Dampe hughe wente betwene the kynge and Rey|nawde that came with hys &s;pere in y^e re&s;t wylling for to doo great harme And at this coming: he &s;mote Dam|pe hughe thorough the &s;heelde &s;o har+de that he perced his herte wyth the
<PB REF="33"> Iron of his &s;pere, and &s;o he fell downe dead afore the kynge. And whan Reynawde had gyuen that &s;troke he wente hys waye after hys brethern.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemaine &s;aw hughe fall dead: he cryed w^t an highe voyce: Now after lordes after, for if the&s;e glotons &s;cape vs: I &s;hal neuer be mery, &amp; Reynawde came agayne to hys folke and &s;ayd to the~. Lordes doubt you not as longe as I am a lyue, but be al a&s;&s;ured and &s;o ryde on hardly and in good araye. &para; What &s;hall I tell you more? Wyt it y^t .xxiiii myle la&s;ted the cha&s;e, and there was neuer a myle: but that they iu&s;ted to+gether, &amp; many knightes were there ouerthrowe~ &amp; &s;layn. But Reynawde and his folke bare them&s;elf &s;o ma~ly that they lo&s;t, but three of theyr fe|law&s;hip at that tyme, but they rode &s;o longe tyll that they came to the ri|uer. The kynge called to him his ba+rons and &s;ayd to them: Lordes let a loue the cha&s;e, it were foly from he~s forth on for to folow them, for I &s;ee in al our hor&s;es may no more let the~ goe to a hundred thou&s;and deuyls, for yf Reynawde wrought with wit|ch craft he could doo no more, tha~ he doth. Let vs thinke for to lodge vs heere nyghe y^e ryuer. For the cou~trey is good and plea&s;au~nt as me &s;emeth Syr &s;ayd the barons, let it be doone as ye haue commau~ded. Than they vnladed theyr &s;ommers, and pyght there their pauyllions. And whan they were &s;et vp: the king made him to be dy&s;armed. And in the meane whyle the &s;upper was made redye lyghtlye, for all the daye the king had nother eate~ nor dro~ke~, nor none of hys felow&s;hyp. And Reynawde was pa&s;&s;ed ouer the riuer he and his bretherne, and his folke &s;afe &amp; &s;ou~d where as they wolde be by the grace of our Lorde, and whan Reynawde and his brethern &s;aw that the cha&s;e was cea&s;&s;ed and left: they went all &s;oftly, and whan they had gone ferre from the o&s;te of king Charlemayne: they found a fountayne fayre and cleare, and aboute that fountayne was muche fayre gra&s;&s;e and thicke. Wha~ Reynawde &s;aw y^e place was &s;o plea&s;au~t: he &s;ayd to hys folke. Heere is a fayre ground for to lodge vs &amp; for our hor&abis;, Sir &s;aid Alarde, ye &s;ay trouth. And tha~ they vnladed theyr &s;o~mers and theyr cartes, and wyt it the hor&s;e were wery, but the poore knyghtes were euyl lodged, for they had there no meate nor drynke but cleare water. But wyt it that Rey|nawde nor none of his knightes di&s;|armed them not, but made good wat+che all the nyght one after another. And whan they &s;aw the daye come: Reynawde made hys harneys to be tru&s;&s;ed, and they lyghted hor&s;e|backe, and tooke theyr way through the great fore&s;t of Ardeyne, and wha~ they had riden longe they lyghted do+wne afore another fountayne that they that had watched the nyght a|fore &s;hould re&s;t them&s;elfe there.</P>
<P>NOw myght well &s;ay Charle|mayne y^t he can neuer hurte the foure &s;onnes of Aymon. And
<PB N="xxviii" REF="33"> wit that he was lodged vpon the ri|uer where he abode, whan he wolde no more folow after Reynawde, and whan the day was clere: he &s;ayde to the duke Naymes. What thynke ye what we ought to doo? Syr &s;ayd the duke Naymes yf ye wyll beleue me: wee &s;hall tourne backe agayne. For to goe any ferther this waye: it were but a foly, for thys wood is to thick and the riuer ouer muche perillous &amp; al&s;o Reynawde &amp; his brethern are &s;uche knyghtes that they be not for to belyghtly ouerthrowen, &amp; while the king and the duke &s;pake together there came many knyghtes to hym, and whan Charlemayne &s;aw them: he called Vydelon, Reynier, Ogier y^e dane and &s;ayd to them. Lordes I will that ye come agayne to parys wyth me. And whan they vnder&s;tode this: they were glad and &s;ayd to the King, Sir it is the be&s;te coun&s;ell that ye ca~ doo, and after that thei were &s;o accor|ded: Charlemayne made to be cryed that euery ma~ &s;hould returne agayn into his countrey, &amp; that they &s;hould kepe it well, &amp; that he prayed theym &s;o to doo. Syr &s;ayd the barons wee &s;hall doo your commaudement, and whan all was &s;ayde: they made the ho&s;te to de&s;cende &amp; take theyr way, &amp; the king went &s;treyght to paris and the barons in theyr countryes, and whan Charlemayne was come to Paris: he called afore him his baro~s &amp; to them &s;ayd, fayre lordes I am y^e mo&s;te vnhappy kyng of the worlde, whan I haue no power to auenge my &s;elfe of the foure &s;onnes of Ay|mon, and they led me as ye know. I wene they &s;hall returne into theyr countrie or to theyr ca&s;tell, and it be &s;o: I wyll y^t we go there agayne for to ley &s;yege there. Syr &s;ayd the duke Naymes, that &s;hal they not doo, for they are in Ardeyne, And ye knowe y^t the fore&s;t is &s;o great that they &s;hall fynde &s;ome cheuy&s;au~ce. That might wel be &s;ayd the kyng Charlemayne. But where &s;ome euer they go: euell way myght they fynde. And whan he had &s;ayd this: he tourned toward Ogyer, and &s;ayd to him. Take Ge|rarde, Foulques the Almayne, and Dron of Moudidier, and gyue leaue to the frenche men and to the other. Syr &s;ayd Ogyer well &s;hal be doone your commaundement. And then we~t Ogier to Foulques, to Gerard and vnto Dron, and tolde them that y^t Charlemayne had commaunded. And after came to the frenche men, &amp; tolde to the other knyghtes, &amp; gaue them leue. And whan the kynges folke haue had leue: eueri man went to his countrey, not the right waye: But trauer&s;ynge the mountaynes. And thus as Aymon went trauer|&s;ynge the lande towarde hys coun|trie: It happed to him &s;o that he came by the fountayne where hys &s;onnes dwelled. Whan Aymon &s;aw hys chyldren: he was aba&s;&s;hed and ryght &s;ory for it. And then he &s;ayd to his barons. Lordes coun&s;ell me I praye you what I ought to doo a|gayn&s;t mi childre~. For and I a&s;&s;ayle them, and that they ben &s;layne or ta|ken: I &s;hall neuer haue Ioye. And I I let them goe: I &s;halbe for&s;worne to Charlemayne. Whan his barons hearde him &s;peake &s;o: there was ne|uer one that an&s;wered anye worde.
<PB REF="34"> And wha~ Aymon &s;awe that he was coun&s;elled of no man: he &s;ayd agayn to them. Syth it is &s;o that ye wyll gyue me no coun&s;ell: I &s;hall doo af|ter myne owne wyll. For god forbid y^t it be layde to me, that I haue fou~d the~ heere. And haue not fought with them. But well I tell you that it is for my &s;ynne that I haue founde them here. But fro~ hens forth it &s;hal be doone therin as it plea&s;eth God &amp; fortune. Syr &s;ayd E&s;menfraye yf ye a&s;&s;ayle your children ye doo not a|my&s;&s;e for ye &s;ware it to the kynge Charlemayne, kepe &s;yr Aimon y^t ye be not for&s;worne. For a man of your age &s;hould rather dye than he &s;hould doo any trea&s;on. Good freend ye &s;ay well &s;ayd Aymon, and I &s;hall &s;o doe that I &s;hal not be blamed, and than he called two of his knightes, and &s;ayd to them. Go towarde Reinawde and his brethern and defye them in my behalfe. Syr &s;ayd the knightes it is a harde thinge for to be doone, but &s;ythe it plea&s;e you: we &s;hall doo as ye haue commaunded, &amp; than thei wente towarde Reynawde that was &s;ore aba&s;&s;hed, for he knew well that they were of his fathers folke, wher|of he was full &s;ory for it. And after he &s;ayd vnto his bretherne. Lordes now arme your &s;elfe. For a man y^t is well garny&s;&s;hed is not of lyghte ouerthrowen, and of the other &s;yde I know &s;o muche the hardynes of my father: that he &s;hall not feyne to be fyght vs. Brother &s;ayd Richarde ye &s;aw trouthe. Thys hangyng: ca|me the two knightes afore him, and whan Reynawde &s;awe them come nyghe hym: he went agayn&s;t them &amp; &s;aid to them. Lordes what be ye? and what winde driueth you hyther? tha~ &s;pake one of the knyghtes, &amp; &s;ayd to Reynawde. Syr we ben knyghtes of my lorde your father that &s;endeth to you by vs a defiaunce. Lordes &s;ayd Reynawde I wy&s;te it well as &s;oone as I dyd &s;ee you of ferre. But go a|gayne &amp; tel to our father that it wyll plea&s;e hym to gyue vs trewce for he &s;hall not doo wel for to be fight vs y^t are his naturall childre~. Syr &s;aid the knight of the folye ye &s;peake, but thinke to defende your &s;elues well, for he &s;hall a&s;&s;ayle you w^tout doubt.</P>
<P>ANd whan they had &s;ayd the&s;e wordes: hey retourned a|gayne for to reher&s;e to Aymon theyr me&s;&s;age, &amp; how they had defyed hys children. Whan the olde Aymon vn|der&s;tode them: he made none other tarying but &s;purred his hor&s;e with the &s;purres, and ranne the forma&s;te vpon hys &s;o~ne. And whan Reynaw+de &s;awe his father come: he came a|gain&s;t him and &s;aid. Ha father what doo you? we haue none &s;o great a foe as ye be to vs, and I haue great mer|uayle that ye come alwayes vpon vs, ye doo yll &amp; great &s;inne for to doo &s;o. At the lea&s;t yf ye wyll by no wy&s;e helpe vs: be not to vs contrary ne e|nemy yf it plea&s;e you. Thou theefe &s;aid Aymon, ye &s;hal neuer doo good &s;yth that ye begyn to preche. Goe to the wood &s;o &s;hall ye become wylde bea&s;tes, euyll day giue you god. For ye ben not worth an handfull of &s;traw Now thynke to defende your &s;elfe.</P>
<P>For yf ye ben taken: ye &s;hal be put to a great tourmente. Syr &s;ayde Rey|nawde
<PB N="xxix" REF="34"> ye doo vs wronge. I &s;hal de|fende me &s;yth that I mai none other wy&s;e doo. For yf I &s;holde let mi &s;elfe to be &s;laine: mi &s;oule &s;hould be put to paine and tourmente. Whan Aymon &s;aw that: he brought his &s;pere in the re&s;t, and put him&s;elf among his chil+dren, lyke as they had ben &s;trau~gers And whan Reynawde &s;aw that: he cryed to hys men, and &s;ayd, heere is none other but doo wel now. Lordes thi~ke to &s;mite wel, for need co~pelleth vs therto. And whan he had &s;ayd y^e worde: he &s;purred his hor&s;e with his &s;purres, and put hym&s;elf in the thic|ke&s;t. And began to make &s;o great ef|fortes of armes, that all the folke of his father meruayled of it greatlye. &para; What &s;hall I &s;ay? the batayle be|gan &s;o fell and &s;o cruell: that pytie it was to &s;ee. For ye &s;hould haue &s;ene gyue and receyue great and horrible &s;trokes of the one parte, and of the o|ther, and many knightes and hor&s;es dye, many &s;heeldes broken and mani white harneys broken. So manye heades &s;mittes of and &s;o many leg|ges and armes broke~ and &s;ore hurt. And thinke that this batayle was &s;ore &s;tronge and well holden of the one &s;yde and of the other. But to &s;ay the trouth: Reynawde mu&s;t lo&s;e at y^t tyme. For hys Father had three ty|mes as many folke as he had. For of fyue hundred me~ that abode with Reynawde after his ca&s;tel was take which were with him at this bataile: were left on lyue, what hurt &amp; &s;ound but fyfty per&s;ones. But I tell you well for verye certayne that Rey|nawde &amp; his bretherne dyd &s;o great harme to the folke of theyr father: that they &s;lew well halfe of the men that he had. But at y^e la&s;t Reynawde mu&s;t lo&s;e and flee away towarde the mountaynes, and Aymon cha&s;ed hym as well as he could, for he we~d well for to haue taken theym. and whan Reinawde &s;aw them &s;elf vpon the toppe of the mountayne: he &s;ayde vnto his brethern. Let vs not depar+te fro~ hence. For this is a good place for to defende. Wyt that there was great &s;carmy&s;&s;hi~g and iu&s;tyng made and many a knyght dead and verye &s;ore wounded. And there was &s;layne vnder Alarde his good hor&s;e. And whan that Alarde &s;awe him&s;elfe a ground: he lept vpon his feete ryght quickli. And tooke his &s;werde in his hande and began for to defende well his bones. And whan that Rychard &s;awe his brother Alarde a foote: he turned towarde him for to helpe &amp; &s;uccour hym, and Aymon and his folke came there for to take him.</P>
<P>So began the batayle yet agayne more cruel then it had be afore. And wyt that Alarde &s;hould haue ben ta|ken there, yf it had not be the noble and worthy knyght Renawde that came for to helpe him. And whan that he was come there: he &s;mote Bayarde wyth hys Spurres, and wente into the greate&s;t pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e. So that he ouerthrew the Duke Aymon his father doune vnto the grounde, and after he &s;ayd vnto hym. Father ye haue pledged my brother Alarde For ye be now &s;et a foote as he is.</P>
<P>Than was Aymon very &s;ore angry that he lo&s;te almo&s;t his wittes. And
<PB REF="35"> Reynawde &s;et his hand to his &s;werde and began for to departe the pre&s;e in &s;uche a wi&s;e that he brought hys bro+ther Alarde out of the pre&s;e, and af|ter &s;ayd to hym. Fayre brother lepe behinde me vpon Bayarde. For to abyde here any lenger: it were folye. Wha~ Alarde vnder&s;tode his brother Reynawde: he was ryght glad for he was &s;o wery y^t he myght no more and &s;o he mounted vpon Bayarde behynde his brother Reynawde. And whan Bayarde wy&s;te him &s;elf lade wyth two knyghtes: he &s;trengthed hym&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly: that it &s;emed to Reynawde that he was more Ioy|ou&s;e and more mery than he had be of al the daye. Now wit it that Rey|nawde made foure Iou&s;tes vpo~ his hor&s;e Bayarde with hys brother A|larde behinde hym. Whereof he &s;lewe foure knightes of the folke of Char+lemayne that were come with hys father Aymon. And all thus Rey|nawde tooke Alarde out of hys ene+myes handes Mawgre theyr teeth &amp; bare hym&s;elf right worthely y^e &s;ame day, as here after ye &s;hal mow more playnly vnder&s;tande.</P>
<P>NOw ben the foure &s;onnes of Aymon recreaunt &amp; almo&s;te wery, but only Renawde that neuer was the weker for nothing that he dyd in armes. For as he went: he tur+ned him&s;elfe at euerye pa&s;&s;e that he made, and rebuked and kept his ene|myes a backe with his harde &s;trokes that he gaue to them, &s;o that his fol|ke wente afore hym all at theyr ea&s;e and ley&s;er. And whan he &s;awe that his folke were wel ferre from their enemyes: he &s;purred Bayarde and came to his folke (his brother Alarde behinde hym) as lightly as bayarde had be without anye brydell and no &s;adle vpon him. For this hor&s;e was &s;uche that he was neuer werye, and thus as Reynawde went away: than cam &amp; folowed after him E&s;menfray y^t was one of the mo&s;te worthy kny|ghtes of Charlemayne &amp; was vpon a hor&s;e right good and blacke, that Charlemayne had geuen to hym.</P>
<P>And whan he was nighe Reynawde he cried to them. So helpe me God glottons ye ben dead or taken &s;ureli I &s;hal brynge you to Charlemayne. And anon we~t and &s;mote Reynawde in his &s;heelde, wherof Reynawde was muche angry, and Reynawde &s;mote him agayne in &s;uche a wy&s;e and wyth &s;o great a &s;trength: y^t ney|ther for his &s;heelde nor for his good armures of &s;teele he was not kepte, but that Reynawde ouerthrew hym &s;terke dead to the grounde. And wha~ this knight was dead: Reynawde tooke his hor&s;e by y^e bridell and &s;ayd to Alard his brother holde fayre bro|ther, light vpon this Blacke Hor&s;e whiche is good. For I gyue him to you.</P>
<P>ANd whan that Alarde &s;awe the fayre pre&s;ent that his bro|ther Reynawde had doone to hym: he was as glad of the &s;ame, as thou+ghe he had wonne Parys. And tha~ he made none other rarienge: but y^t he lighted downe from Bayard and mounted vpon E&s;menfrays blacke hor&s;e that his brother had giue~ hym &amp; &s;mote him with the &s;purres &amp; went
<PB N="xxvii" REF="35"> and Iu&s;ted agayn&s;t a knyght of his fathers folke that was called anfrai &s;o harde that he ouerthrew him dead to therthe. And &s;hortly to &s;peake af|ter that Alarde was in this wi&s;e &s;et agayne on hor&s;e backe: began the ba|tayle of a fre&s;he &s;ore hard and fell, in &s;o muche that at that houre were &s;layne .xx. of the be&s;t knyghtes that Aymon had with him. Whan Aymo~ &s;aw this: he was &s;ore angry for it, &amp; cryed to hys folke. Halordes yf they &s;cape you I &s;hal neuer haue ioy, for they haue &s;layne E&s;menfray y^e good knyght that king Charlemayne had gyuen to me. Whan the folke of Ay|mon vnder&s;tode the&s;e wordes, &amp; the wyll theyr Lorde: than they dyd ren vpon Alarde &s;o much that thei made hym to leue the place by force, and if it had not be the pa&s;&s;age of a lytle ri|uer that ea&s;ed and holye them great+ly: Reinawde and hys brethern had muche to doo, but I tell you with|out faute that Reynawde and hys brethern made &s;o great occi&s;yon of that folke of theyr father: that it was pitie for to beholde, for there dyed well of them .xxv. at the pa&s;&s;age of the ryuer and yf Reynawde had had wyth him a fyfty knightes more the~ he had at y^e pa&s;&s;age: he &s;hould haue dy&s;comfyted his father and all hys folke but for faute of me~: Reynawde mu&s;t for &s;ake the place and myght not &s;aue with hym but .xiiii. knygh|tes of hys owne. Nowe &s;ee how &s;o|rowfull was the batayle, for of fyue hundred knyghtes that Reynawde had with hym there abode wyth him alyue but .xiii. and ye maye well wit that the olde Aymon had domma|ged his children right &s;ore, but that they pa&s;&s;ed ouer the Riuer, for as it is &s;ayde they had lo&s;te all theyr men wherof they were full &s;orye and wrothe.</P>
<P>&para; Now hath Reynawde &s;o fewe fol+ke that he wot nomore what to doo, but he might not doo therto, wherof the teres fell downe continually fro~ his eyen, and in lykewy&s;e wept Ay|mon hys father at the other &s;yde as the hi&s;torye dooth tell, and whan he had wept ynough: he &s;ayd in this maner. Ha fayre Sonne pane and worthye howe &s;orye am I? for I am the occa&s;yon of your harme and domage, now &s;hall ye all goe as exi|led, for ye haue nought to lyue vpon &amp; I cannot helpe you by anye wy&s;e, wherof I en&s;ure you I am greatlye di&s;plea&s;ed and &s;ory for it.

<P>_IN this party the tale &s;ayth, y^t after that Reynawde had &s;layne E&s;menfray and giue~ his hor&s;e to his brother A|larde: they pa&s;&s;ed ouer the ryuer and went into the fore&s;t of Ardeyn &s;ore deep in it, by cau&s;e they wolde not be aperceyued. And whan they had ben there a lytle whyle: they bega~ to keep the wayes, &amp; all they that came for by them and that bare any vytayles they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by them and ther of they liued, for they dur&s;te not goe to no towne nor to no Ca&s;telles for to bye anye vytaylles, and there|fore they &s;uffred great need &amp; greate dy&s;ea&s;e, for they had nother meate nor drynke, but water. For the mo&s;t parte they eate fle&s;&s;he without anye breade. And knowe that for cau&s;e of thys great &s;uffrau~ce y^t they endured thus, &amp; al&s;o of the great colde y^t they had, for by cau&s;e of the &s;nowes that were there: theyr folke began to dy. And abode nomo liue but Reynawd and his brethern. And thys was be|cau&s;e of the great &s;trength that was in theyr bodies. For no trauayle mi|ght not hinder them. And wit y^t they had but eche of them foure an hor&s;e that is to wit Bayarde and the thre other, but they haue nother Otes nor other Corne for to gyue theym, but they eat only &s;uch as they might fynde in the fore&s;t of rootes and lea|ues. And for this cau&s;e: theyr hor&s;es were &s;o leane that with peyne might they &s;tande, &s;aue Bayarde that was fatte and in good plight, for he could better feede and lyue w^t rootes, than
<PB N="xxxii" REF="37"> the other &s;houlde haue doon with hey andotes. And wyt it well that the foure &s;onnes of Aymon lyued there this life &s;o longe that euery man that pa&s;&s;ed there as they were and kepte theim &s;elfe, e&s;caped not, but he was other &s;layne or di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of &s;uche vy|cailles as he had, &s;o that all the coun|trie aboute them was &s;ore wa&s;ted by theim that it was meruaille. And at the la&s;te the foure knightes were &s;o &s;ore apayred, that they that had &s;eene them afore: &s;houlde not haue knowen them, for their harnays was all ru&s;ty and their &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lles and brydelles all rotten, &s;o that they had made their rei|nes with cordes. And them &s;elf were become all blacke. And it was no meruayle, for they weared alwayes their cote of mayle all rou&s;tye vpon their doublettes, and hadde nother &s;herte nor Iacket but they were all rotten. &leaf; What &s;hal I tel you more? and wyt that Reynawd was douted and feared &s;ore that it was meruail. For nigh there as Reinawd hau~ted: was no man that dur&s;t abide there, but onely within the fortre&s;&s;es. For whan Reynawd was mounted vpo~ Bayarde, and his three brethern vp|on their other three hor&s;es: all their ryche&s;&s;e and power was with them, and yet they wa&s;ted and de&s;troyed all the countrie all about theim. And &s;o the foure poore knightes were &s;o &s;ore di&s;figured, that who &s;omeuer had &s;eene them, &s;hould not haue knowen them. For they were as roughe as beres that been famy&s;hed and were ryght &s;ore lene that euery bodye had of it pytie.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde &s;awe him&s;elfe &s;o porely arayed: he called to him his brethern and &s;ayde, Lordes I meruayle my &s;elfe muche that we take not &s;ome good coun&s;ell what we haue to doo, and me &s;emeth that we ben become yl, &amp; that &s;louthe is amonge vs. For yf we were &s;uch as I crowed: We &s;houlde not &s;uffre the martirdome that we endure and that we haue endured &s;o longe a goe, no we know I that we ben but lytel worth to haue let re&s;te oure enemyes as we haue.

So praye I you all in generall that ye wil tell me what we ought to doo for the be&s;t, for I tel you for very certaine that I had muche leuer die as a knight than for to die heere for hungre &amp; for dy&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>ANd whan Alarde hearde Rey|nawde &s;peake thus: he &s;ayde, brother &s;o helpe me god.

Wha~ the two other knightes hearde the cou&s;eil y^t Alarde their brother had gyue to Reinawde: they began to &s;aye. Brother Alarde we know wel that ye gyue good cou~|&s;eyll to our brother Reinawd. Than &s;ayd Reynawd.

And &s;o longe they rode by nyght and by daye that they came there as they were borne that was nigh the citie of Ardeyn, and whan they were &s;o nigh the citie that they myghte well &s;ee it: they looked vpon it, and they remem|bred the greate ryches wherfro thei were ca&s;t and bany&s;&s;hed, and of the greate pouertye that they had &s;uffred longe. And as they aproched nyghe the cytye. Reynawde &s;ayde to hys brethern we haue doone euyl that we haue not taken &s;uretie of oure father, for ye knowe well that he is &s;o cruell that yf he may take vs: he &s;hal yeelde vs pri&s;oners to Charlemain. Brother &s;aide Rychard, ye &s;aye well but my herte gyueth me not that oure father wolde doo as ye haue &s;aid, and he &s;o dyd: yet haue I leuer die afore Ardeyne: than for greate dy&s;ea&s;e and hungre in the fore&s;t, let vs ryde &s;ure|ly, for I telle you that no bodye &s;hall know vs. And of thother parte if we can &s;et oure feet within Ardeyne: we &s;hal be &s;afe ynough, for we be wel be|loued, and my laid our mother &s;hould neuer &s;uffre that men &s;houlde doo to vs any harme ne dy&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>CErtes fayre brother &s;aide Rey|nawde, ye haue &s;ayde tyght wel and wi&s;ely, and much ye haue recom|fort me. Nowe let vs ryde in a good houre. And whan he had &s;ayd the&s;e wordes: they entred &s;oone after with in Ardeyne, and they tode thorough the may&s;tres &s;treate that they were not knowen of no bodye, &amp; they went &s;treyght to the ca&s;tel without any ta|ryinge. And wyt that whan they pa&s;|&s;ed thoroughe the &s;tretes: the folke that behelde them, merueylled muche of them, for they wy&s;te not what fol|ke they were, and &s;ayd the one to the other, &s;ee what folke ben the&s;e. I trowe that they ben not of oure lawe nor of our beleue. Than they a&s;ked theym, what ben ye lordes that are &s;o countrefaite, are ye Paynemes, or of what countrey ben ye? Syrs an&s;we|red Reynawde ye enquere ouer much &s;ee ye not what folke we been. And whan they were come to the palays they lyghted downe a foote, and too|ke their hor&s;es to keep to their kni|ghtes
<PB N="cxxxlii" REF="38"> that were come of late in their felaw&s;hip, and tha~ the foure brethern wente vp to the halle, and met with no body. For the olde Aymon theyr father was a hawkyng vpon the ri|uer, &amp; the duche&s;&s;e their mother was in her chambre, where &s;he was con|tynually pencyful and &s;ory bycau&s;e y^t &s;he might not heare no tidinges of her childre~. Whan y^u foure brethern were entred wythin the haile: they fou~de no man to whom they &s;hould &s;peake, wherof they were &s;ore mer|uayled and they &s;et them&s;elf downe, the one heere, and the other there, &amp; abode th&abus; a longe whyle that no bo|dy came there. And whan they had caried longe ynoughe: than came the duche&s;&s;e theyr mother out of her chambre, and &s;he looked a longe the hall, where &s;he &s;aw her &s;onnes thus counterfayte whiche &s;he knew not but meruayled her&s;elf greatly what folke they were.

My good freende where wyll ye that the ca&s;tel be made? Syr &s;ayd Reynawde, I wyll yf it plea&s;e you that it be &s;et here in the &s;ame place vpon this ro|che.

<P>ANd whan Reynawde vnder|&s;tode the curte&s;ye &amp; the good|nes of the kyng: he tha~ked him right muche, &amp; he &s;ent thorough all the la~d and made come all the may&s;ters ma|&s;ons and carpe~ters and many other crafty men in &s;uche worke, &s;o muche that they were well two hundred be|&s;yde the labourers, and whan al hys &s;tuffe was redye: he made theym to buylde there a &s;tronge ca&s;tell, wher|of the great hall was fyr&s;t made and after many chambres and than the great tower. And wha~ the doungeo~ was wel clo&s;ed: Reynawde made af|ter all the ca&s;tell to be clo&s;ed rounde aboute w^t double walles hie &amp; thick of hard &s;tones, &amp; many toures vpon that it fered no &s;awtyng of no &s;yde of it, &amp; made to this ca&s;tell foure ga|tes and no mo, and al&s;o he made the portcoly&s;&s;e faw&s;ebrayes &amp; barbaca|nes well defen&s;able &s;o that it myght be no better.

<P>THan wha~ the maryage was made accorded, &amp; made &s;ure of the one parte &amp; of thother: y^e kinge yon came to the cha~ber of his &s;i&s;ter, and found her be&s;y aboute a penoun+cel of a &s;pere, that &s;he made ful fayre for y^e knight Reynawde but &s;he dur&s;t not tell it.

And the kynge wolde make no taryeng therat, but tooke y^e pucel by the hande, and brought her to the churche well honourably, and the by&s;hop of Bordews wedded the~. And whan Reynawde had his wyfe e&s;pou&s;ed: he &s;ente for hys bretherne &amp; for his co&s;yn Mawgys that were at Mountawban, the whiche made great Ioye, and made all Mounta|ban for to be hanged wyth ryche ta|pi&s;&s;ery. And than they mou~ted their hor&s;es all couered wyth &s;endall and wente to Bordews, and met with Reynawde and hys wyfe by the way where as great Iu&s;tinge was made afore the ladyes. And after the Iu|&s;tyng was doone: they came all to Mountawban, and whan they were come there: the Ioye began for to be greate in the ca&s;tell as god had de&s;|cended there. For to &s;ay trouth .viii. dayes la&s;ted the fea&s;t, &amp; many great gyftes were pre&s;ented and gyuen to the lady. And whan the fea&s;t had en|dured as longe as I tell you: The king Yon went againe to Bordews ryght glad of the maryage, that he had made of Reynawde and of hys &s;y&s;ter.

<P>WHan Charlemayne vnder&s;tode the&s;e wordes: he was ryght angry for it and wrothe. And wy&s;t not what he &s;hould &s;aye, and helde hym&s;elf a great whyle that he &s;pake not, and whan he had mu&s;ed a lytle, he &s;ayde to his folke, fayre lordes I &s;hall tell you a wonder. For I haue founde myne enemyes in this lond, that ben the foure &s;onnes of Aymon. Now vp Ogyer and you duke Nay|mes, lyght on hor&s;backe incontinent, and &s;eke &s;o muche kyng Yon that ye fynde hym, and tell hym in my be|halfe that he yelde to me againe the foure &s;onnes of Aymon that be mine enemyes them whiche he hath wyth|drawen and borne out agayn&s;t me.

And wente aboute to vnder&s;tande where kyng Yon was. And &s;o long they a&s;ked after hym that they founde hym at Mountawban euen at the foote of the roche.

Whan the fren&s;hemenne heard Rowla~d &s;peke thus: they &s;aid free knight be not dy&s;maied of no|thyng, for we make no doubte that none of theym &s;hall &s;cape, but they &s;halbe taken or &s;layne.

And whan Rowland &s;aw him: he lighted down from hys hor&s;e, and went and ke&s;t hym &s;elfe to the feet of kyng Char|lemayne his vncle. And anon he made him to ri&s;e vp, and ky&s;&s;ed him &s;weetly: And than Rowlande &s;aid to him. Sir here I deliuer vnto you the king E&s;corfawde, that we haue taken.

And after whan E&s;|corfawde was put in pri&s;on: the king Charlemayne dyd calle to him the Duke Naymes and &s;ayde to him what thinke you by my neuew Row+lande, what dyd he whan the batayl was a&s;&s;embled. Sir &s;ayde the duke Naymes, of Rowlande nedeth not to &s;peke, for neuer &s;ith that god was borne, of the vyrgin Marie: &s;uche a knight was not &s;een. For he alone hath ouercome the &s;ara&s;ins by hys great prowes. And yf he had a hor&s;e that might beare him whan he were armed: I &s;were by my fayth that ye &s;hould neuer haue enmye, but that he &s;hould bring him to your mercye by force of armes. So muche he

And whan thys was done: he made his crown to be &s;ette at the ende of the ly&s;tes, and al|&s;o the fyue hundred marke of &s;iluer and the hundred rolles of &s;ylke, and this hanging: a yeman went to hys countrey in Ga&s;coine, and as he pa&s;+&s;ed thorough Mou~tawba~: he recoun|ted to Reynawde and to Mawgys all the thyng that menne wolde doo at Paris.

And whan the yl rybawde &s;aw com &s;o many folke: he was yet more hardye than he was afore, and wente afore the other, and tooke Reinawde by the bridle of Baiarde. And whan Baiarde &s;awe that: he lifted his fore|foote and &s;mote the ribaude vpon the bre&s;t, that he bra&s;t the herte in his be|lye, &amp; ca&s;ted him all dead to the erthe And wha~ the people &s;aw the &s;troke: thei began all to laugh, and Bayard went forth, &amp; Maugis after that thei were not knowen: &amp; pa&s;&s;ed through the towne to the market. And whan thei were comen there afore the lod|ges: thei founde all the Innes full. Wherof Reynawde was maruailed. And &s;o they lighted at a cordeners hou&s;e, that was of the deuilles &s;ide. For by him was almo&s;te Reinawde and Mawgys taken, and delyuerd to Charlemaine that his bretherne &s;hol|de not haue holpen hym of no thynge. whan they were lyghted and lodged where it is &s;ayde, &amp; that their hor&s;es were well dre&s;&s;ed: Mawgys dyd doo make a bedde for Reynawde and toke a thred of &s;ylke, and &s;ered it well and came to Bayarde, and bounde hym the mowes of the feet there withall well &s;treyte. And the ho&s;te behelde well this, and after &s;aid to him. Why haue you thus bounde this hor&s;e? he &s;hall not conne well goe. But tel me what knighte is he that oweth the hor&s;e?

And than Mawgis came forth|with to the &s;table and &s;adled Bayar|de. And made Reinawde to mounte vpon him, and after him&s;elfe lyghted vpon Morell, and went out of the lod|ges. And whan the wyfe and the chil|dren of the ho&s;te &s;awe thys that Rey|nawde had doone: they began to crye, But Reynawde and Mawgys were &s;oone out of their waye, &s;o that none wy&s;te where that they were become and wente and put them &s;elfe amon|ge the other in the pre&s;e, and they were neuer knowen. But Baiarde wente haltinge, and wente to the gate of &s;aynt Martyne, and there they a|bode all the nighte. And whan it was day: they wente with the other to the chyrche where the kinge hearde his ma&s;&s;e.

And whan all was appa|railled: Thenne &s;houlde ye haue &s;ene knightes leape on hor&s;ebacke. For e|uerye man trowed to haue gotten the price, and the kinge commaunded to the duke Naymes and to Ogyer, vnto Guydellon of Burgoyne and to Ry|charde of Normandy, that they &s;hould take a hundred knyghtes well armed and that they &s;houlde keep well the fea&s;te, that no noy&s;e nor no &s;tryfe were there made, and that none &s;hould wronge the other, and they dyd his commaundemente. And thenne the knyghtes that &s;houlde renne: begane for to beholde Reynawde that was mounted vpon haltinge Bayarde, and &s;o they beganne for to laughe and &s;corne with him.

<P>THan whan themperoure vn|der&s;toode the great wordes y^t the knyghtes &s;ayde to Reynawde: he was wrothe for it, and he &s;aid &s;o high that it was well heard of all. I com|maunde you vpon paine of my grace that ye &s;aye no &s;hame nor yll worde to no maner of knyght. For yf ye doo ye &s;hall anger me &s;ore. But Rey|nawde cared not much of that it was &s;aide to him. Whan the Duke Nay|mes and Ogyer &s;awe that it was ty|me for to renne: they made to &s;owne the trompettes. Then euerye man putted hym &s;elfe for to renne, And whan Mawgis &s;awe that euery man ran: he lighted on foote and vnbound the foote of Bayarde. But or euer he was vnbounde: the other were wel ferre, and whan Reynawde &s;aw that it was tyme for to renne after the o|ther: he &s;purred his hor&s;e, &amp; &s;aid to ba|yarde, we been ferre behynde ye my|ght wel abide. For if ye be not &s;oone afore: ye &s;hall be blamed, whan Bay|arde heard his mai&s;ter &s;peake thus: he vnder&s;toode him as well as thoughe he had been a man. Than he grylled his no&s;ethrels and bare his head vp and made a long necke, and tooke his cour&s;e &s;o fa&s;t that it &s;emed the erthe &s;hould haue &s;onken vnder hym, and within a whyle he was pa&s;&s;ed all the other hor&s;es a ferre waye &s;o that men coulde not &s;ee him for du&s;t that he rei|&s;ed. And whan thei that tooke heed to the cour&s;es &s;awe Baiarde ren thus: they were greatly aba&s;hed with all, &amp; &s;ayde the one to thother beholde that whyte hor&s;e renneth fa&s;t and lyght, and but late he halted &s;ore, he is the be&s;t of all thother that been heere.</P>
<P>ANd whan themperour &s;awe this: he called to him Richard of Normandye, and &s;ayde to hym, &s;awe ye euer &s;o many good hor&s;es to+gither as heere ben now? but y^e whyte pa&s;&s;eth them all, God how is he well like baiarde the hor&s;e of Reynawde? yf he had the heares of Bayarde: I &s;hould &s;aye that it were he hym &s;elfe, and he that &s;ytteth vpon him is al&s;o light and prue. &leaf; Thus wyte it that Reynawde hath doo &s;o muche that Bayarde hath ouercome all the other hor&s;es. And whan he was at the end of the ly&s;tes: he tooke the crowne and put it on his arme, and the &s;yluer and the clothe he left alone, for he day|ned not to take them. And whan he hadde taken the crowne: he returned agayne towarde the kyng Charle|maine all faire and a &s;oft pace, whan the kynge &s;awe hym come towarde hym, he &s;ayde to hym all laughyng. Freend abyde a lytle I praye you, for yf ye wyll haue my crowne ye &s;hall haue it, and I &s;hall geue you for your hor&s;e &s;o greate hauoyre: that ye &s;hall haue

By God &s;ayde Rey|nawde the&s;e wordes &s;hall nought a|uayle you, now haue I well begyled you, for I go doo marchaundi&s;e els where and I holde you for a chylde. I haue &s;o often angred you &amp; of youre men I haue &s;o many &s;layne. I am Reynawde that beareth away your crowne, &s;eke els where for a nother hor&s;e that ye &s;hall giue to Rowland for to ouercome Baiard, for ye &s;hal not haue bayarde nor al&s;o your cro|wne. And as &s;oone y^t he had &s;aid this he &s;purred bayarde wyth hys &s;pur|res and went &s;o fa&s;t a way that it &s;e|med that the tempe&s;t had cha&s;ed hi~. And whan the kynge Charlemayne vnder&s;tode thys y^t Reynawde had &s;ayd to hym: he was wode angry for it that he wy&s;te not what he &s;hould doo &s;o that he myght not of a greate whyle &s;peake a worde. And whan he had recouered his &s;peche: he began to crye with a hye voyce, nowe after lordes after, for it is myne enemye Reynawde the &s;onne of Aymon.</P>
<P>And whan the knyghtes heard thus crye the kynge Charlemayne: they &s;purred theyr hor&s;es with y^e &s;purres and went after Reynawde, but their goynge auayled theym nought. For Bayard was ferre from them with in a whyle &s;o y^t they wy&s;t not where he was become, and Reynawde cam to Sayne and pa&s;&s;ed ouer it al at his ea&s;e with &s;wymynge, for Bayarde was well wonte therto, and al&s;o he had pa&s;&s;ed it afore with more great ha&s;te. And wha~ that Reynawde was thus pa&s;&s;ed the ryuer of Sayne: he lyghted from Bayarde at the banke of it. Thus hanging: the king Char+lemayne and his knightes that folo+wed after hym, came to the ryuers &s;yde, and began to call Reynawde &amp; &s;ayd to hym. Ha true man, &s;oone yel|de me my crowne agayne and I &s;hal gyue thee .x. tymes as muche as it is worthe, and I &s;hall gyue thee tru|ce two yeres, &s;o that thy &s;elfe and thy brethern &s;hall mow go in ardey|ne to &s;ee your mother the which de&s;i|reth &s;ore to &s;ee you, and there is no knyght in my lande that &s;hal &s;ay co~|trary to it, by god &s;ayd Reynawde as for the&s;e wordes auayle you nothi~g, for ye &s;hall neuer haue agayne your crowne. I &s;hall &s;ell it and &s;hall pay my knyghtes withall, and the char|boncle that thus &s;hyneth &s;hal be &s;et hye vpon my pauylyon to the ende that they y^t &s;hall go to &s;aynt Iames in Galyee may &s;ee it the better, and ye &s;hall be blamed of your knyghtes that ye haue lo&s;te your crowne by the hor&s;e Bayarde, whan Charlemayn hearde hym &s;peake thus: he wy&s;t not what he &s;hould &s;ay for angre, &amp; kept him&s;elf &s;tyl like as he had ben dead. And whan Reynawde had &s;ayde &s;o: he mounted agayne vpon Bayarde and put hym&s;elf to the way, but not the ryght way: but rode throughe a lytle pathe whyche he had pa&s;&s;ed a|fore tyme.</P>
<P>NOw &s;hal I tell you of Maw|gys how he dyd for to come out of Parys y^t was mounted vpon his hor&s;e morell. Whan he wy&s;t that Reynawde was pa&s;&s;ed Sayne he i&s;|&s;ued out of Parys and pa&s;&s;ed the ry|uer ouer the brydge as &s;oone as he might. And whan he was without:
<PB REF="56"> he began to looke after Reynawde &amp; as he rode he looked a trauer&s;e and &s;awe Reynawde, &s;o called he after hym as hie as he could, co&s;yn thinke to ryde fa&s;t, for to tary heere no good &s;hall come to vs, co&s;yn &s;ayde Rey|nawde ye &s;aye well and we &s;hall doo &s;o. And &s;o they tooke theyr waye to|warde Myllon. And whan Alarde &s;aw his brother come and Mawgis: he &s;ayd to his folke. Lordes we may well come out of our bu&s;&s;hemente, for I &s;e come my brother Reynawde &amp; Mawgys. Alas &s;ayd Richarde I &s;ee them come wyth greate ha&s;te.

For the longe taryenge might doo to vs harme bicau&s;e that I brynge wyth me the crowne of Charlemayne, the whiche Bayarde hath made me wynne by his pro|we&s;&s;e. And whan Alarde vnder&s;tode his brother &s;peake thus: he was &s;o greatly in Ioye that he wy&s;te not what he &s;hould &s;ay but colled &amp; ky&s;|&s;ed his brother Reynawde w^t greate Ioye. And than incontine~t they put them&s;elfe to the waye and &s;o longe they rode y^t they came to Orleaunce and pa&s;&s;ed the ryuer of Loyre wyth all dylygence, and after they made &s;o muche by theyr Iourneys: y^t they came to Mountawban whole and glad, thanked be god.</P>
<P>THan whan they were at mou~|tawban: the lady came them agayn&s;t &amp; receyued them right glad|ly, and made them ryght great there and all the folke of the Ca&s;tell were ryght glad of the comynge of Rey|nawde and of hys bretherne, and a&s;|ked him how he had doone in his vi|age, lordes &s;ayd Reynawde wel god gramercy.

And whan the trompettes began to blowe for to be+gyn y^e cour&s;e: they that &s;hould renne departed incontinent, and I bode be hinde well the &s;hotte of a bowe, and I tell you well for certayne, there were well twenty thou&s;ande hor&s;es.

But the king Charlemayne began for to make hys mu&s;tres, for to know how much people that he had. And whan the the mu&s;tres were made: they found that they were well .xxx. thou&s;ande knyghtes that had theyr fyr&s;t berdes be&s;yoe the olde knyghtes that were well an hundred thou&s;and. And wha~ that this was doone: the Empe|rour Charlemayne called Rowland his neuew afore him and &s;ayde to hym.

And yf that they brought that were worth a peny: they &s;hould haue two for it. And whan that thys greate armye was come to Bloy they pa&s;&s;ed ouer Gyronde and wente afore the great ca&s;tell of Mountawban. And they lodged them&s;elf there rounde about the place.

And as he was come in, he found the &s;tewarde with an hundred men that wente aboute vi&s;itynge the watches and the war|des. Incotinente the knyght &s;alued hym, and the &s;tewarde rendred hym agayne hys &s;alute and &s;ayd to him. What be ye Gentylman, and what &s;eke you heere wythin? I pray you tell me what folke are yonder wythout &s;o fayre a company. Syr &s;ayde the knyght they ben the folke of the Emperour Charlemaine that is come for to be&s;yege the Ca&s;tell of

For ye knowe well that they be~ folke that may doo to you good &s;eruyce. And yf Rey|nawde be once in peace with you: ye &s;hall be the better beloued and more dred therfore. But &s;ith that your wil cannot accorde to the &s;ame: we maye not doo therto. To a&s;&s;ayle the ca&s;tel I coun&s;el it not.

<P>CHarlemayne vnder&s;tode well the&s;e wordes and knew well that the duke Naymes &s;pake wel &amp; wy&s;ely and &s;ayd to hym. I wil that it be doone thus as ye haue deuy&s;ed it. And tha~ he made crye through his ho&s;te y^t euery man &s;hould lodge hym|&s;elf euyn nighe by the Ca&s;tell, and he him&s;elfe commaunded that his pa|uyllion &s;hould be pight as nighe the gate as coulde be doone. After thys was cryed ye &s;hould haue &s;een wyth in a litle whyle moe than ten thou|&s;and pauillions rounde aboute the Ca&s;tell of Mountawban. Whan the ho&s;te was al lodged: Rowlande de|parted out of the ho&s;te well with two thou&s;and knightes wel armed &amp; wel hor&s;ed and all yonge men of pryme berde, whiche were very fren&s;he born of the douce fraunce, and went at y^e other &s;ide of Mou~tawban, in a place whiche is called Balancon where was a riuer great and deape, in the whych was fi&s;&s;he ynough, and there he dyd pytche his pauillion.

For I promy&s;e you that Mou~tawban &s;hal neuer be taken of vs, ye &s;ay not well &s;ayd Olyuer. For we tooke well by force Lezonne, &amp; al&s;o we ouerthrew downe the great towre and the doun+geon of Sernoble, wherof I &s;aye y^t we &s;hall well haue Mountawban, And yf Reynawde and his bretherne come not and yelde them &s;elfe: they &s;halbe in daunger of death.

For I promy&s;e you that the gentyll Reynawde &s;hall make vs &s;o &s;ore a|ferde that the mo&s;te hardy wolde be at Parys. Reynawde is prue and coragious, and his brethern in lyke+wi&s;e, and al&s;o they haue within y^e ca|&s;tell many noble and worthy knigh|tes. Wherfore I &s;ay and I am of opi+nion, that as lo~ge as they haue vy|tayle they &s;hall neuer be taken. Wha~ y^e pauillion of Rowlande was dre&s;|&s;ed and pight vp: Rowlande behelde the riuer and &s;aw that it was full of byrdes, than he &s;ayd to the By&s;&s;hop Turpyn and to the other Barons, See howe wee are lodged in a good place. Let vs goe in the&s;e Ryuers to let flee our Fawcons. Syr &s;ayde the Bi&s;&s;hoppe Turpin, goe in the name of God. Then lyghted Row|lande on hor&s;ebacke and tooke with
<PB REF="60"> hym wel .xxx. knightes, and no mo. And they tooke their hawkes, &amp; rode the mo&s;te parte of them vpon mu|les all vnarmed &s;aue theyr &s;werdes and came and &s;ported them alonge the ryuer &s;yde, &amp; tooke many byrdes vpon the water, in &s;o great quantitie that they laded a hor&s;e wythall, the by&s;&s;hop Turpyn and Ogyer, wente not there but abode behynde for to keep the ho&s;te, and they were before y^e tentes where they made two aunci|ent knightes to recou~te and tel how the great Troy was taken and dy|&s;troyed, this hangyng: was a &s;pye in the ho&s;te of king Charlemaine, that longed vnto renawde, the whyche he had &s;ent there for to know what they wrought, and howe they dyd &amp; all the fayte of Rowlande, and inco~|tinent the &s;pye departed out of the ho&s;te and wente to Reynawde, and &s;hewed to hym how Rowlande and Olyuer were gone to &s;portynge w^t theyr Hawkes vpon the ryuer, and wyth them thyrtye of the be&s;t of the ho&s;te.</P>
<P>WHan the &s;pye had recoun|ted the&s;e tidynges to Rey|nawde: he was of it ryght glad. Than he called his brethern &amp; Mawgys his co&s;yn, &amp; tolde them how Roulande and Olyuer and .xxx of the be&s;te barons of Charlemayne were gone to hawking vpon the ry|uers in the plaine of Balanco~. What ought we to doo &s;ayd Reynawde? Co&s;yn &s;ayd Mawgys we may well kill the~ if we wyll, for they ben well proude &amp; foly&s;he, reme~bre ye not wel that a me&s;&s;a~ger tolde you a moneth a goe that Charlemayne had left all olde knightes of his Realme, &amp; had taken of the yonge, &amp; that he had de|parted all Ga&s;coyne to the yonge ba+chelers of Fraunce? And by thys bo|ban Rowland &amp; Olyuer ben moun|ted into &s;o great pryde that they trow in al the worlde is no man that dare a&s;&s;aile them nor looke vpon them an grely. But and yf ye wyl beleue me: I &s;hall tell you &s;uche a thynge, that &s;hal make them wrothe &amp; &s;ory. And tha~ reinawde made &s;owne his horne y^e which me~ neuer herde &s;owned but y^t it was need, for whan men hearde it: euery man ran to his armes for to arme hym. And incontynent Rey|nawde and his bretherne, and Maw+gys made them&s;elfe to be armed.</P>
<P>And whan they were al armed and well apparelled: Reynawde lyghted vpon Bayarde his good hor&s;e, and &s;purred hym wyth hys &s;purres, &s;o that he made hym to lepe wel thyrty foote of length. Ha good hor&s;e &s;ayd Reynawde: how ye make your &s;elfe to be beloued. And how wel I mi&s;tre you this dai.

<P>ANd whan Reynawde &s;awe that his folke was wel appa|relled, he wente out with his men at a fal&s;e po&s;terne, that they of the ho&s;te coulde not &s;ee them. And they were wel in his co~pany about foure thou&s;and well hor&s;ed and well ar|med, And a fo&s;ter conduyted them

Than brought he them &s;treyght to Balancon. And whan Reynawde &s;awe the pauylions: he &s;hewed them to his folke, to whome he &s;ayde, be holde what fayre gayne wee haue founde heere yf wee dare &s;et vpon them. Syr &s;ayd his men, let vs goe to it hardelye, for we dur&s;te well a&s;|&s;ayle the deuyl, whan ye be with vs. &para; Nowe &s;hall I tell you of the by&s;|&s;hop Turpin that was a bid to keep the ho&s;te, wherof he had great feare bycau&s;e he wy&s;t well agayn&s;t whom he had a doo, and had a great &s;u&s;pec+cion and heaued vp hys head, &amp; &s;aw the Rauens &amp; the Dawes flee about vpon the fortre&s;&s;e. And from thens they tooke theyr flyght ouer Rowla~|des pauilion. And made great noi&s;e And &s;o was he aferde, for he wende that it had be &s;ome euyll token, and he behelde towarde the woodes that were great, and &s;aw anon hys ene|myes, wherof he was &s;ore afrayde y^t almo&s;te he was be&s;yde hym&s;elfe.</P>
<P>Than he called Ogyer the Dane and &s;ayd to hym, free knyght for goddes loue goe arme your &s;elfe, and let our folke be armed, for heere comen our enemyes. Now ben well Rowlande and Olyuer gone for nought that ar gone to the cha&s;e and haue left theyr ho&s;te thus in great dau~ger. I beleue that thei &s;hal not fayle but they &s;hal repente it &s;ore. Whan Ogyer hearde Turpyn &s;peake in thys maner: he was very &s;ore an angred, &s;o went he in his pauylion and made hym to be armed incontynent for to moue the ho&s;te. And whan that the Frenche|men hearde the trumpettes blowe: they put them&s;elf in ordenau~ce no|bly. Thys hanging: Ogyer was ar|med and mounted vpon hys hor&s;e Brayforde, and founde that a great parte of them was armed and al re|dye.

<P>REynawde was aba&s;hed whan he &s;awe the ho&s;te that moued &s;o: and &s;ayde vnto hys folke, Lordes we ben dy&s;couered, but yet neuerthe|le&s;&s;e let vs go to it and a&s;&s;ayle them they an&s;wered that they were all re|dy for to doo &s;o.

<P>THan whan the kinge yon of Ga&s;coigne &s;aw that y^e mo&s;te party of his coun&s;eil accorded to that he &s;houlde yeelde Reinawde and his brethern to king Charlemyane he be|gan to weep right tenderly, and &s;aid in him &s;elf that no body could here it, by god Reinawd I am &s;ore charged for you, nowe &s;hall departe my loue for you, for ye &s;hall le&s;e the body, &amp; I &s;hal le&s;e therby y^e loue of god &amp; of his

But I tell you that GOD &s;hewed that day for Reinawde a fay|re miracle, for the chambre where the cou~&s;ell was kept that was al white: chaunged colour &amp; became al blacke as a cole. Lordes &s;ayde the kynge yon, I &s;ee well that I mu&s;te yeelde the foure &s;onnes of Aimon, &s;yth that the mo&s;t parte of you accordeth ther|to, and I &s;hall doo it, &s;ith that that ye coun&s;eyl me &s;o. But I wot wel that my &s;oule &s;hall neuer haue therof no pardon. And &s;hall be therfore taken all my life as a Iudas, and than they left the coun&s;eyll, and went oute of the chambre. And whan the kynge was come out of the chambre: he &s;et him downe vpon a benche, and be|gan to thinke &s;ore. And as he was in this thought: he began for to weep &s;ore for greate pitie that he had. And whan he hadde thoughte and wepte ynoughe: he called his &s;ecretary, and &s;aide to him. Come forthe &s;yr Peter and write a letter fro~ me to the ki~g Charlemaine, as I &s;hall tell you. It is that I &s;ende him &s;alutacion with good loue. And yf he wyll leaue me my londe in peace: I promy&s;e hym that afore ten dayes been pa&s;&s;ed. I &s;hall deliuer vnto him the foure &s;on|nes of Aymon and he &s;hal find them in the playne of Valcolours, clothed with &s;carlet, futred with ermynes, and rydynge vpon mules, betynge in their handes floures, and Ro&s;es for a token, for becau&s;e that menne &s;hall better knowe them. And I &s;hal make theym for to be accompanyed of eyghte earles of my realme, and if they &s;cape from him: that he blame me not for it. Than &s;ayde the &s;ecre|tory, &s;yr your commaundement &s;hall be doone, the whiche tooke anon pen and ynke and wrote the letters word for worde as the king had deui&s;ed to hym. And when they were wryten and &s;ealed: the kynge called hys &s;tu|arde and &s;ayde to hym. Now make you ready on hor&s;ebacke, and goe to the &s;yege of Mountawban, and re|comende me vnto the kinge Charle|mayne, and gyue hym the&s;e letters. And tell him yf he wyl quite my lon|de: I &s;hall doo this that is of rea&s;on, and none otherwy&s;e. Syr &s;ayde the &s;tuarde I &s;hall gladly doo your com|maundement, doubte not for it, than went the &s;tuarde in his hou&s;e, and made him readye on hor&s;ebacke, and rode out of Tholou&s;e, and tooke the Heraude of the kinge Charlemaine with him. And whan they were com vnto Mountawban: they fou~de the Emperoure Charlemaine in his pa|uyllion, where the &s;tuarde lyghted down, and went within and &s;aluted the king Charlemayne fro the kynge yon of Ga&s;coygn, and pre&s;ented him the letters fro his behalfe, and &s;ayde vnto hym. Right mighty Emperour the kinge yon &s;endeth you worde by me that yf ye wil en&s;ure his lond: he &s;hall fulfil the tenour of this lettre, and otherwi&s;e he wyl not.</P>
<P>WHan Charlemayne vnder&s;tood the&s;e tydynges: he was ryghte gladde, he tooke the lettre of the me&s;&s;anger, and called Rowlande to him &amp; Olyuer, the by&s;hop Tur|pyn, the duke Naymes. Ogier the

Syr &s;aid they al with a good will. And than they went all out of the pauillion, and whan they were al gone: Charlemayne opened the let|tres and red theim all alonge. And he found therin that whiche he mo&s;t de&s;yred in this worlde, that was the trea&s;on as it was ordeyned, whan Charlemaine had red the lettre: he myghte be no gladder than he was. And of the great Ioye that he hadde of it he began to &s;myle. Syr &s;ayd the &s;tuarde yf ye &s;ee oughte in the lettre that plea&s;eth you not: blame not me for it. For I know not yet what it is. Than &s;ayde Charlemaine to the &s;tu|arde. Your lorde the kinge yon &s;pea|keth ful curteou&s;ly, and if he doo that he dooth me to wyt: he &s;hall be well my good freend.

Syr &s;ayde the &s;tuarde of this that ye &s;ay: ye &s;hal giue me &s;ureties yf it plea&s;e you. Than &s;aid Charlemayne, I wyl doo &s;o gladlye. This I &s;were vpon the &s;onne of the vyrgyn Mary and al&s;o vpon &s;aint Denis of Fraunce who&s;e man I am. Sir ye haue &s;aid all yno|ugh an&s;wered the me&s;&s;anger of king yon, and none other &s;urety I a&s;ke of you.</P>
<P>THan Charlemain called his chamberlayne &amp; &s;aid to hym make a lettre to king yon of ga&s;coy|ne in my behalfe, as I &s;hall deuy&s;e it vnto you. Wryt that I &s;ende him &s;alutacion and good loue, and that it he dooth for me as he &s;ayth I &s;hall encrea&s;e hys realme with fourtene good ca&s;telles and therof I giue him for &s;uretie our lorde and &s;aint denys of Fraunce, and that I &s;end him four manteles of &s;carlette furred with er|mines, for to clothe withall the tray|toures, whan they &s;hall goe to the playne of Valcoloures, and there they &s;hal be hanged if god wil, and I wil not that any other haue harme, but only the foure &s;onnes of Aimon. Syr &s;aid the chambrelain, your com|maundement &s;hal be wel doone, and than he made the lettres, as thempe|roure had deui&s;ed him. And whan he had made them: the emperour Char|lemayn &s;ealed them, and after he cal|led the me&s;&s;ager afore his pre&s;ence, and &s;aide to him. Holde the&s;e lettres and take them to king yon from me, and recommend me to him. And than he dyd gyue hym .x. marke of golde and a Kyng that he tooke of his fyn|ger. Wherof the me&s;&s;anger thanked him much humbly, and incontinente lighted on hor&s;ebacke, and whan he was aryued: he &s;alued the kyng yon of Ga&s;coyn from king Charlemai|nes behalfe and tooke him the letters and the mantelles as Charlemayne had commaunded him.</P>
<P>THan whan the me&s;&s;anger of the king yon was gone Char|lemaine made come afore hym Foulques of Moryllon, and Ogier the dane, and &s;ayd to them. Lordes I haue &s;ente for you. For I wil that ye two knowe a litill of my &s;ecretes.
<PB REF="66"> But I tell you vpon your faith that none other &s;hall know the &s;ame but onely we vs three vnto the time that the deede be accomply&s;hed. Syr &s;ayd Ogier yf ye thinke that we &s;houlde di&s;couer youre &s;ecrete: tell it vs not And if ye tru&s;te vs: declare hardelye your plea&s;ure. Certes &s;aid the empe|roure to Ogier, ye be well worthy to knowe al, for I know you for a good and a tru&s;ty knight. Sir &s;aide Ogier your good gcamercy. But I tell you that I wyll not know nothyng ther|of, but that ye take fyr&s;te mine othe therupon. Lordes &s;aid Charlemaine I take it. Nowe &s;hall ye goe to the plaine of Valcolours with three hu~|dred knightes wel armed, and whan ye &s;hall come there: ye &s;hall finde the foure &s;onnes of Aimon. And thus I commaunde you that ye brynge them to me other dead or quicke, Syr &s;aide Ogier I &s;aw them neuer but armed, howe &s;hall we know theym? Ogier &s;aide Charlemaine ye &s;hal well may knowe theym. For eche of theym &s;hall be clothed wyth a mantell of &s;carlette furred wyth ermynes and &s;hall beare ro&s;es in theyr handes.</P>
<P>Syr &s;aide Ogier that is a good to|ken, and we &s;hal doo your commau~|demente. They made none other ta|ryinge but departed from the ho&s;te of the kinge Charlemaine as pryuelye as they myght doo. And rode to the plaine of Valcolours, and put them &s;elfe in a bu&s;&s;hemente wythin a woode all of &s;erpyn trees, vnto the tyme that the foure &s;onnes of Aimon came to the playne of Valcoloures. Ha god whye knewe not Reynawde and hys bretherne this mortall trea|&s;on? for they wolde not haue come there vpon mules: But they &s;houlde haue come there vpon good hor&s;es, and well armed, as prue and worthy knightes that they were. But &amp; god had not remedied it: thys Reynawde and his bretherne &s;houlde haue been &s;o one taken in a litill &s;pace, for they were in daunger of death. Whan O|gyer y^e dane &amp; Foulques of Moryllo~ were in their bu&s;hement: Foulques called his folke and &s;ayde to theym. Fayre lordes I oughte well to hate Reynawde, for he &s;lewe myne vncle by great wronge. Nowe am I come to the poynt that I &s;hall be auenged on hym, and I &s;hall tell you howe. Nowe wyt it that the kynge you of Ga&s;coyn hath betrayed the~ and they &s;hall come hyther anon all vnarmed &s;auf their &s;werdes. And therfore I praye you all that ye thynke to &s;mite well vpon them, then &s;hall I know who loueth me be&s;t.

<P>NOw &s;hal we telle you of the kynge yon that was at Tho|lou&s;e. Whan he had receyued the let|tres of the kinge Charlemayne: he called to hym his &s;ecretary Godras and &s;aid to him. Looke what this let+tre &s;ayeth. And the clerke brake in continent the &s;eale, and beheld the te|noure of the lettre, and founde howe Reynawde and hys brethern &s;hould be betrayed and liuered to the death, &amp;
<PB N="lxi" REF="66"> whan the clerke had redde the lettre: he began to weep &s;ore tenderlye, and if it had not be for doubt of the king: he wolde gladly haue vttered it, and whan kinge yon &s;aw his &s;ecretarye weep: he &s;aide thus to him, keep wel vpon your lyfe that ye hide nothinge fro me, but tell me all that the let|tre conteineth and what the kynge Charlemayne wryteth to me. By my fayth &s;aid Godras. It is a &s;ore thing for to reherce. Nowe lightely &s;ayde the kyng yon, tell me what the kyng Charlemayne &s;endeth me, &s;yr &s;ayde Godras, I &s;hall tell it you gladlye. And than he beganne to &s;hewe to kyng yon howe Charlemayne &s;ente him worde, that yf he wolde doo as he had wryten vnto him: he &s;houlde encreace his power of fourtene good ca&s;telles more than he had. For the &s;uretie wherof: he &s;wereth it vnto you vpon our lorde god, and &s;aint denys of Fraunce his patrone. And he &s;en|deth you foure mantelles of &s;carlete furred with ermines, that ye &s;hall geue to the foure &s;onnes of Aymon, for to were theym, &amp; thus they &s;hall be knowen. For Charlemaine will not that none take any harme, but on+ly the foure &s;onnes of Aimon. And he dooth you wyt that his folke are with in a bu&s;hement within a woode by the plaine of Valcolours, that is to wyt Foulques of Moryllon and Ogier the dane, with three hundreth men wel hor&s;ed and well armed that abiden there foure &s;onnes of Aimon, the which ye &s;hould deliuer in to their handes. Whan the kinge yon vnder|&s;toode the tenoure of the lettre: he made ha&s;te for to fulfil his promi&s;e. And incontinent he lyghted on hor&s;e|backe, and tooke in his company a hundred men wel arraied, and tooke his waye towarde Mountawban. And as &s;oone as he might: he came &amp; entred with in at the gate fletcher.</P>
<P>And whan he was within: he made his folke to lodge them in the borow And he went vp to the palays as he was wont to doo wha~ he cam there. The~ whan his &s;i&s;ter the wife of Rei|nawd wi&s;t of the coming of the king yon her brother: &s;he came ayen&s;t him and tooke him by the hand, &amp; wolde haue ki&s;&s;ed him as &s;he was accu&s;to|med to doo whan he came there, but the king full of euell trea&s;on turned hys face a &s;yde, and &s;ayde he had the tooth ache, and wolde not &s;peake with her but litill. But he &s;ayde that men &s;hould make him a bedde ready. For he wolde re&s;t him &s;elfe a lytell And whan he was layde: he began &s;ore to thinke, and &s;aide to him &s;elfe. Ha good lord, what haue I wrought ayen&s;t the be&s;t knyghtes of the world that I haue betrayed &s;o fal&s;ly. Now &s;hall they be hanged to morow with|oute faute. I pray god to haue mercy and pitie vpon them? Now maye I well &s;aye that I &s;hall be lykened to Iudas from hence forthe, and I &s;hal haue lo&s;te the loue of god and of hys mother, and al&s;o myne honour. But I mu&s;t needes doo it &s;ith I haue pro|my&s;ed it &s;o, and the wyll of my ba|rons is &s;uch, for thus they haue cou~|celled and haue made me do it. Wher|of I am ful &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>
<PB REF="67">
<P>AL thus as the king yon thou|ghte in the greate trea&s;on that was thus machyned vpon the foure &s;onnes of Aymon: there came in Reinawde from hunting, &amp; al his bretherne with him, and had taken four wild bores &s;ore great, and whan Reinawde was within Mountaw|ban: he hearde the noy&s;e of the hor&s;es and wende that it had been &s;traunge knightes that were come vnto him to take wagis. And than he a&s;ked of a yema~ what folke were the&s;e &s;trau~|geres that were come in withou leue? Syr &s;aid the yeman they ben the fol|ke of king yon that is come within for to &s;peake with you of &s;ome ma|ters. But me &s;emeth by his folke y^t he is not well at ea&s;e of his per&s;one.</P>
<P>THan &s;aid the good Reinawd. Ha God why hath my lorde traueylled him&s;elfe &s;o muche for to come hither? For I wold with a good will haue gone to him. And after whan he had that &s;aide: he called to him a &s;eruaunte of his and &s;ayde to him, goe fet me my horne Boudiere. For I wyll make fea&s;t and Ioye for the coming of my &s;ouerain lorde, and incontinent it was brought to him, and Reynawde tooke it and &s;ayde to his bretherne, Nowe take eche of you his owne and let vs make fea&s;t for the loue of king yon. Than they tooke eche of them his horne and be+gan to &s;owne all foure at ones right high, and made &s;o greate noy&s;e that the ca&s;tel &s;owned of it. For they ma|de &s;o great Ioye for the loue of kinge yon that it was merueyll. Whan the kynge yon heard the trumpettes that thus &s;owned &s;o &s;ore that the cha~+bre where as he laye &s;hooke of it: he aro&s;e vp from the bed and cam to the wyndowe, and &s;aid to him &s;elfe. Ha what euyll haue I wrought ayen&s;t the&s;e knightes? Alas howe make ye Ioye ayen&s;t &s;o greate a combraunce the which I haue purcha&s;ed to you? I haue betrayed you right fal&s;ely, as a wycked and vntrewe kynge that I am. For a man that betrayed hys freend: oughte neuer to haue honoure nother in this world nor in the other but oughte to be lo&s;t bothe body and &s;oule. For he hath for&s;aken god: and hathe gyuen him&s;elfe to the deuyll. And whan he had &s;aied that: he retur|ned agayne vpon his bed &s;ore vexed at the hearte and euell at ea&s;e more than any man might be. Than Rey|nawde and his bretherne came vp to the palace, where thei fou~d the king yon, and whan he &s;awe theym come: he ro&s;e ayen&s;t them, and tooke them by the hande and &s;aide to Reinawd. Be not merueylled that I haue not enbraced nor ky&s;&s;ed you: for I am &s;ore laden with great euyll. And it is wel fourtene daies gone that I could nother eate nor drinke anye thyng<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> that dyd me good. Than &s;aide Rey|nawd &s;ir ye be in a good place where ye &s;hall be tended vpon ryghte well with goddes grace. And I and my bretherne &s;hall &s;erue you to oure po|were, gramercy &s;aide the kinge yon. Than called he his &s;tuarde and &s;ayd to him. Go and bring me the mantel+les of &s;carlet furred wyth ermynes that I haue doone make for my dere freendes. Incontinente the &s;tuarde
<PB N="lxii" REF="67"> dyd the commaundemente of kynge yon. And as &s;one that he was come agayne: the king made the foure bre|thern to put the foure mantelles vp|on them, and praied theim to were them for his loue. Sir &s;aide Alarde this is a gladde pre&s;ente and we &s;hal were theim for the loue of you with very good will. Alas if they hadde knowen how the thing was brought aboute, they &s;houlde not haue borne them, but they &s;hould haue doone al otherwi&s;e. Alas and what &s;orowful harme they hadde of this, that they were thus clothed. For that were the tokens and recogny&s;&s;aunce wherof they were in dau~ger of death, if god had not holpen them of his pitie and mercy. And whan the foure &s;onnes of Aimo~ had their mautelles on: the kyng yon behelde them, and had of them great pitie, and began to weep There was his &s;tewarde that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ray&s;on well wi&s;t, that &s;aide not one word for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ere of king yon. And wha~ the mete was redy: Reynawde pra|yed muche the king that he woulde eate. For he made him to be &s;erued ryght wel. Whan they had eaten: the kyng yon ro&s;e vpon his feet, and to|ke Reynawde by the hande, and &s;aid to him. My faire brother &amp; my frend. I wil tell a coun&s;eyll that ye know not. Nowe wyt that I haue bee at Mountbenden, and I haue &s;poken with king Charlemayne the which charged me of trea&s;on, by cau&s;e that I keep you in my realme, wherof I haue pre&s;ented my gage afore all hys company, and no ma~ was there &s;o hardy that dur&s;te &s;peake ayen&s;te that, that I &s;ayd. After this we had many wordes togither, among whi|che we &s;pake of good accorde and of peace, whereof at the la&s;te the kyng Charlemayne was contente for my loue for to make peace with you, in the maner that foloweth. That is to were that to morow erly ye &s;hal goe to the playne of Valcoloures ye and your brethre~ al vnarmed but of your &s;werdes mounted vpon youre mu|les, and clothed with the mantelles that I haue geuen to you, and that ye &s;hall beare in your handes Ro&s;es and floures, and I &s;hall &s;ende with you eyght of myne earles for to goe more honourably, the which ben al of my lygnage. And there ye &s;hal finde the king Charlemaine, and the duke Naymes of hauyere, and Ogyer the Dane, and all the twelue Peres of Fraunce, and there Charlemayne &s;hall gyue you &s;uertie. And ye &s;hall doo to him reuerence in &s;uch maner that ye &s;hal ca&s;t your &s;elfe to his feet and there he &s;hall pardone, you, and he &s;hall gyue you agayne all youre londes entierly.</P>
<P>THan &s;ayde Reinawde, &s;yr for gods mercy. For I haue greate doubt of the king Charlemaine by cau&s;e he hateth vs to death as ye know. And I promy&s;e you it he hol|dethe vs he &s;hall make vs to die a &s;hamefull death. Good freend &s;aide the traytoure kynge yon, haue ye no doubte at al. For he hath &s;worne vn|to me vpon his faith afore al his ba|ronye. Sir an&s;wered Reynawde we &s;hall doo your commaundements. Ha God &s;ayde Alarde. What &s;aye you my brother? ye knowe well that

Neuer haue god mercy v|po~ my &s;oule, yf I goe there without mine armes, nor without to be as it apperteyneth, brother &s;aid Reinawd ye &s;aye not well. God forbed that I &s;hould mi&s;tru&s;t my lorde the kyng yon of any thing that he telleth me. And than he turned hym towarde the kyng yon and &s;ayde to hym. Sir without any faute we &s;hall be there to morowe earlye in the mornyng, what&s;oeuer happeth of it. Fayre lordes &s;aid Reynawde god hath hol|pen vs wel that we haue peace with the kynge Charlemayne to whome we haue made &s;o longe time &s;o mor|tall a warre, but &s;ith that my Lorde the king you hath made thys peace: I am content to doo to him as much reuerence as to me is po&s;&s;yble. For I am delybered to goe naked in my &s;mall lynen clothes to the Mounte|&s;aynt Michael. And wha~ Reinawd had &s;ayd this word: he toke leaue of kyng yon and went in to the cham|bre of the faire lady his wife, &amp; fou~d there his other two brethren that were with her, &amp; wha~ the lady &s;aw her hu&s;bonde come: &s;he came ayen&s;t hym and tooke him betwen both her armes by great loue and ki&s;&s;ed hym Lady &s;ayd Reynawde I ought wel to loue you by great rea&s;on. For your brother the king you hath trauailed hm &s;elfe right &s;ore for me, and hathe be &s;ore blamed at the courte of Char|lemaine for me, but he hath doone &s;o muche ble&s;&s;ed be god that he hathe made my peace with the king Char|lemaine. And that Rowland and O|liuer. Nor all the twelue Peeres of frau~ce might neuer make: he hathe graunted vs againe all our landes. And all thus we &s;hall be riche, and &s;hal liue al our life in re&s;te &amp; peace, &amp; &s;o &s;hall we mow helpe, and gyue the hauoyre that we haue vnto the poore knightes that haue &s;erued all theyr lyfe truely and wel.</P>
<P>THan &s;ayd the lady. I thanke god greatly therof with al my hert. But tell me where the concor|daunce &s;hall be made, and hyde it not from me yf it plea&s;e you.

By my fayth &s;aid than Guycharde to Alard I am now well whole, &s;ith that our deare brother Reynawde &s;hall be to our helpe, for as longe as he &s;hall be a liue: we &s;hall defende our &s;elfe, but not after, for thoughe I might cho&s;e I wolde not liue after he were dead. And whan he had &s;ayed thys: they medled them&s;elfe amonge theyr ene|mies. Shortly to &s;peake of the foure &s;onnes of Aimon a&s;&s;embled wel a|yen&s;t three hundred good knightes, but their courage were neuerthele&s;&s;e therfore as longe as they had lyfe in the body: but that they &s;hewed vnto their enemies a knightes face, whan Foulques of Morylion &s;awe Rey|nawde come: he &s;purred his hor&s;e with the &s;purres &amp; bare his &s;peare a low, &amp; went &amp; &s;mot Reynawd by the mantell of &s;carlet that was aboute his arme &s;o great a &s;troke that hys &s;pere entred through his thygh and ouerthrewe bothe hym and his mule to the earthe.

Alas we haue lo&s;t Reynawde our brother that was al our hope and our &s;ecour now may we not e&s;cape, but that we &s;hall be dead or taken, and it is better that we yelde vs pry&s;oners at this time: than to defende vs anye more. For &s;ith it is &s;o: oure defence &s;hall helpe vs nothynge ayen&s;t &s;o many folke. And whan Reynawde vnder&s;tod the wordes of his brother, he cryed to him with a loude voyce and &s;ayd. Fie vpon you glutto~ what is that ye &s;ay? I haue no harme yet, but I am al whole as ye be, tha~ked be god, and yet &s;hall I telle me full dere or I die. And whan Reynawde had &s;aied this: he ro&s;e vp quickelye and tooke the &s;pere with both his ha~|des, and pulled it oute of his thyghe with great greef, and after &s;et hande to his &s;werde. And &s;ayde to Foul|ques of Moryllon, knyght if ye will doo like a good man: light a foote as I am. And ye &s;hall knowe what I can doo. Whan Foulques of Moril|lon vnder&s;tode him: he turned vpon him &s;ore an angred, and thought for to haue &s;mitten him on hys heade, but Reynawde drewe a litell a&s;yde, and wente and gaue vnto Foulques &s;uche a &s;troke vpon hys helme: that nother yron nor &s;tele myght not &s;aue hym, but that Renawde cloue hym in to the harde teeth and felled him deade to the catthe.

And whan he was thus &s;et on hor&s;backe: he made his hor&s;e to renne and held his &s;pere alowe, and went and mette with the earle Angenon by &s;uche maner that he put both yron and wood throughe the bre&s;t of him &s;o that he mu&s;t fall down dead fro the hor&s;e to the grou~d afore his foote.

O god &s;ayd he where are my brethren gone? nowe be they well ferre from me, we &s;hall neuer come togither again. And than came there Alarde that in likewy&s;e had wonne a hor&s;e, the &s;heeld and the &s;pere, for he had &s;laine a knight, and had taken his hors, but he was &s;ore hurte.

But Reynawde pa&s;&s;ed throughe them al and broughte him|&s;elfe out of the pre&s;e, and Alarde af|ter hym.

For I tel you that we be no mo but two, and they be &s;o great nombre of folke that wee can doo nothing agayn&s;t them.

Brother &s;ayd Alarde now &s;et your &s;elfe afore &amp; I &s;hal folow you &amp; after my power I wyl helpe you to re&s;cue hym. And whan Reynawde heard y^t: he ca&s;t his &s;heeld behinde him, and habandon|ned his body all boldely as a Lyon, and cared not how the game &s;hould go, for ye &s;aw neuer wood men hew in a fore&s;t, nor make &s;o great noy&s;e as Reynawde made with his &s;werde amonge his enemyes for he cutted &amp; hewed legges and armes by &s;uche wy&s;e that no man &s;hould beleue it, but they that &s;ee it.

Let goe the knyghte ye yll folkes, for ye be not worthye to touche hym, and whan they that led Guycharde &s;awe come Reynawde: they were &s;ore afrayed that they put them &s;elfe to flight &amp; left Guycharde free and &s;ayde the one to the other. here cometh the ende of the worlde. And wha~ Reynawde &s;aw that they fled: the &s;ayd to Alarde. Goe ye fayre brother and vnbinde Guicharde our brother and &s;et him vpon this hor&s;e and gyue him a &s;pere in his hande, &amp; come after me, for the traytours ben dy&s;comfyted. Brother &s;ayd Alarde. I &s;hall goe where it plea&s;e you, but I tell you yf we parte one from the other: we &s;hall neuer come together agayne &s;eyng that we be &s;o few &amp; &s;o yll armed, but let vs keep together, &amp; helpe thone thother. Brother &s;ayde Reynawde ye &s;ay well &amp; wi&s;ely, and we &s;hal doo it. And than they wente bothe together to Guycharde, &amp; vn|bounde
<PB REF="74"> hym, and made him mounte on hor&s;ebacke y^e &s;heelde at the necke, and the &s;pere in the hande. Now goe there the three brethern together, and the fourth fighteth agayn&s;t a greate nombre of folke, that was the valy|aunt Richarde, that was the mo&s;te worthy of all after hys brother Rei|nawde. But men had &s;laine his mu|le vnder hym, and was wounded ryght &s;ore. But he had &s;layne fiue er|les, and well .xiiii. knyghtes, wherof he was &s;o &s;ore trauayled and &s;o we|ry, that he might not all mo&s;te defe~de him&s;elfe no more, but went rounde aboute the roche. And than came ge|rarde of valcome that was co&s;yn to Foulques of Moryllon the whyche he had founde dead, wherof he made great &s;orowe, &amp; &s;ayd. Ha gentyl kni|ght it is great domage of your deth. Certes he that hath brought you to this death he is not my freend. Now &s;hal I auenge me if I maye, &amp; than he came to the roche. And whan he &s;aw Reynawde in &s;o great greefe: he &s;purred his hor&s;e with his &s;purres &amp; bare his &s;pere alowe &amp; &s;mote Ry|charde through the mantell of &s;car|let, that he wrapped aboute his lifte arme &s;o harde that the &s;pere entred ferre in his bodye &s;o muche that he brought hym to the erth, and as he drewe hys &s;pere agayne: the guttes of Richarde came out of y^e body into his lappe, &amp; the wou~de was &s;o great that the lyuer and the lounges appe+red. Than began Gerarde to crye. No ware dy&s;coupled y^e foure &s;onnes of Aymo~, for I haue &s;layne Richard the hardy fighter, all the other &s;hall &s;oone be &s;layne or taken, yf god giue me helth.

<P>THan whan Richarde was come a lytle to his e&s;e: he ro&s;e vp quyckely vpon hys feete, &amp; tooke hys bowelles with bothe his ha~des and put them agayne into his belye and after &s;et hande to hys &s;werde, &amp; came to Gerarde and &s;ayd to hym in great angre. Thou cur&s;ed man thou &s;halt haue thy rewarde anon for that ye haue doon to me, for certes it &s;hal not be vmbrayed to Reynawde that ye haue &s;layne his brother, and wha~ he had &s;ayde thus: he &s;mote Gerarde through the quyras, and throughe y^e &s;heelde &s;o great a &s;trooke, that he he|wed the &s;houldre and the arme with all from the body &amp; felled hym down dead to the erth afore hys feete, and than &s;ayd to him. Certes Gerarde it had be better for you that ye had not come hytherwarde, for to the kynge Charlemayne now &s;hal ye not beare your bo&s;te that ye haue &s;layne one of the foure Sonnes of Aymon. And whan he had &s;ayd that: he fel downe in a &s;wonne, and whan he was come agayne to hym&s;elfe: he began for to wi&s;&s;he after hys brethern, and com|playned them &s;ore, &s;ayinge. O Rey|nawde fayre brother this daye &s;hall departe our company. For I &s;hal ne+uer &s;ee you, nother ye me.

For I wot not where they ben, nor of me they may neyther haue he|lpe nor &s;uccors, for I am all redy for to dye.</P>
<P>NOwe &s;hall I tell you of Rey|nawde of Alarde, and of Gui+charde that faught &s;trongly agayn&s;t theyr enemies, as worthy knightes that they were. But all theyr great faytes of armes &s;hould auayled the~ nothinge yf they had not come to a narowe way of the Roche, where men myght not come to them but a fore. And whan they had be longe there: Reynawde began to &s;ay to his brother Alarde, Brother where is be+come our brother Richarde that we &s;aw not of a good whyle a goe? now thinke none other but that we &s;hall neuer &s;ee him, for I left him heere bi thys &s;apyn tree, whan ye and I had &s;o much to doo. I praye god yf he be dead that he haue his &s;oule. Now I wyl wit tidinges of him yf it be po&s;|&s;ible. Brother &s;ayd Alarde yf ye wyll beleue me ye &s;hall abyde heere, God pardon him if he be dead, for we mai not helpe him the perill is to greate and I beleue that we &s;hould dy afore that eue~ were come. Ha brother &s;ayd Reynawde &s;hall we fayle to our bro+ther Richarde the good knight and worthy? Than &s;ayde Alarde, what will ye that we &s;hall doo therto? for as to me I knowe no remedy to it. Alas &s;ayde Reynawde ye &s;peake fo|ly&s;hly, for I &s;hould not doubt for fe|re of death to wit where he is becom And if I &s;hould goe alone, yet &s;hall I vnder&s;tand &s;ome tidinges of him. Brother &s;aid Alarde I promi&s;e you if we depart the one from the other: We &s;hall neuer &s;ee vs agayne toge|ther. Brother &s;ayd Reynawde other dead or all quicke, I &s;hall finde him where &s;o euer he be it maye none o|ther be, and whan Reynawde had &s;ayde the&s;e wordes: he &s;purred hys hor&s;e wyth his &s;purres, and cam at the other &s;ide of the roche. And wha~ they that had cha&s;ed Richarde there for to &s;lea him &s;aw Reinawde come: they &s;mote hem&s;elfe to flight, &amp; than Reynawde wente a lytle more vp|warde vpon the roche, and founde there his brother Richarde that laye nyghe dead vpon the ground, &amp; helde his bowelles betwene his handes, and about him were a great numbre of folke which he had &s;layne. Whan Reynawde &s;aw him dead and &s;o &s;ore wounded: he had of it &s;o great &s;orow at hys hert that almo&s;te he fell down dead to the grounde but he tooke co|rage and cam nighe his brother and lyghted downe from his hor&s;e &amp; ki&s;|&s;ed him &s;ore weeping and &s;ayd. Ha fayre brother it is great pitie &amp; dom|mage of you and of your death for certes neuer man was worthe you, for yf ye had come to mans age ne|uer Rowlande nor Olyuer were &s;o prue in knighthode, as ye &s;huld haue be. Alas now is lo&s;t our beauty and our youthe thorough greate &s;ynne. O good lorde who &s;hould euer haue thought y^e onye trea&s;on &s;hould haue
<PB REF="75"> entred into the hert of the king yon? Alas my brother Rycharde woe is me for your death, for I am cau&s;e of it. Alas thys daye in the mornynge whan wee departed out of Moun|tawban we were foure bretherne al good knightes, now are we but .iii. that ben perillou&s;li wounded and al vnarmed. Nowe God forbed that I &s;hould &s;cape &s;ythe that ye be dead v|pon the traytours. But I pray god that I may venge your death vpon them or euer I decea&s;&s;e. For I &s;hall &s;et therto my good will, &amp; if god will it &s;halbe &s;o. Euen thus as Reinawde made mone ouer hys brother: he be|helde behynde hym and &s;awe come his brethern Alarde and Guycharde all di&s;comfyted, that cryed vpo~ Rey|nawde. Brother what doo you? com anon and help vs for we haue great need. And whan Richarde heard the voyce of Alarde: he opened his eyen, and whan he &s;aw his brother Rey|nawde afore hym: he &s;ayd to hym. O brother Reinawde and what doo you heere? &s;ee ye yonder that roche which is &s;o hyghe and &s;o &s;tronge, where as ben manye &s;mall &s;tones aboue, yf we myght doo &s;o muche that we cli|med vp there: I beleue that we &s;hold be &s;afe from our enemies, for it can|not be but our co&s;yn Mawgys kno|weth our di&s;ea&s;e by thys: and he &s;hal come to &s;uccour vs. Brother &s;ayde Reynawde wolde god we were there now tell me my fayre brother howe feele ye your &s;elfe? thinke ye that ye maye recouer healthe? yea &s;ayde Ry|charde yf ye &s;cape and els not, for w^t the &s;ore that I haue, I myght well dye for &s;orowe.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde heard Richarde &s;peake th&abus;: he was ryght glad of it. So called he Alard to him and &s;ayde. Brother take Ry|charde vpon your &s;heelde, and lede hym vpon the roche, and Guicharde and I &s;hall rowme the waye a fore you, brother &s;ayde Alarde, doubt not I &s;hall doo my power. And than he lighted downe and tooke vp Richard and layde hym vpon hys &s;heeld, and after he lighted againe on hor&s;backe and Reynawde and Guycharde leyd hym with his brother vpon the hor&s;e necke, and after put them &s;elfe afore to breake the prece of the Frenche|me~. And they did &s;o muche that they came to the roche. But wyt it well that Reynawde made there &s;o great faytes armes, that all hys enemyes were meruaylled with all. For he &s;lewe at that tyme wel thyrty knigh|tes, that neuer wylde Bore, nor ty|gre, nor Lyon, nor Bere dyd y^t Rey|nawde made there of his body. But for to &s;ay the trouthe: Reynawde &s;et|ted nought by his lyfe, and ieoparde him&s;elf al together, for he was as a man de&s;perate. And whan they were come to the roche, Alarde &s;et downe his brother Rychard to the erth. And began to defende quyckly, but I wot not how they might endure, for they had nother Ca&s;tell nor fortre&s;&s;e, but onlye the roche.</P>

Certes knight ye &s;halbe dead wee haue &s;worne your death. This day is the departyng y^t ye &amp; your brethern &s;hall &s;uffre death Ye did as fooles whan ye beleued the kynge You, for he hath put you all to death. Whan Alarde &s;aw &s;o great folke come: he was &s;ore an angred, and &s;ayd to Guycharde. See howe great a &s;orow is heere afore vs, and the great nombre of folke that be re+dy for to &s;lea vs foure knightes. cer|tes yf we were fyue hundred wel ar|med yet &s;hould not we &s;cape, for they ben wel armed and a great quantiti of knightes. Surely &s;ayd Guichard heere is a meruaylou&s;e companye, but yf God helpe vs nowe: wee ben com to y^e ende of our dayes. It is no great dommage of me nother of Ri|charde, but the great dommage is of Reynawde that is the be&s;t knyghte of the worlde. And whan Alarde and Guycharde had &s;poken togyder: they wente to Reynawde and ky&s;&s;ed him full &s;ore wepynge, and &s;ayde vnto hym O brother Reynawde giue vs a gyfte yf it plea&s;e you for the loue of oure lorde God. Lordes &s;ayde Rey|nawde what thynge a&s;ke you of me? ye know wel ynough that I can not helpe you of no thing, and thys day mu&s;te I needes &s;ee you dye before min eyen.</P>
<P>BRother &s;aid Alarde, Herke what we wyll tell you, and yf it plea&s;e you ye &s;hall doo it. Say on hardely &s;ayde Reynawde. Brother &s;ayde A|larde men &s;ayen comenly that it is better to doone one harme: than two I &s;ay thys bycau&s;e y^t if ye dye heere: it &s;halbe great dommage, &amp; the lo&s;&s;e &s;hal neuer be recouered agayne, for none &s;hall auenge your death, but though we dye heere and not you: it &s;halbe no great domage, for ye &s;hal auenge vs wel, and therfore we pray you &s;weet brother for al the plea&s;u|res that ye wolde doo euer to vs, y^t ye wyll goe your wayes, and wee &s;hall abyde heere. And whan y^e death &s;hal come; we &s;hall take it a worthe. This that we &s;ay ye may well doo: for ye be well hor&s;ed, and ye &s;hal wel &s;aue your &s;elfe maugre the Frenche men, yf they goe to Mountawban, &amp; whan ye be at Mountawban: lyght vpon Bayarde well armed, &amp; bringe anon wyth you our co&s;yn Mawgys for to &s;uccour vs. Brother &s;ayd Rei|nawde, ye &s;peake to foly&s;hlye. Cer|tes I wolde not doo &s;o for all the golde of the worlde. I &s;hould be &s;ore bad and full vnkynde yf I dyd &s;o, for I coulde not &s;pyll my &s;elfe &s;ouer than for to leaue you in &s;o great pe|ryll. Other we &s;hall all &s;cape: or els we &s;hal all dye together, for the one &s;hall not fayle the other as longe as we may lyue, now God that &s;uffred death and pa&s;&s;ion &s;aue vs. Thus as Reynawde &s;pake to hys bretherne: came the erle Guymarde to whome God gyue euyl aduenture, and &s;ayd to Reynawde, knight ye be take and ye mu&s;t dye wyth &s;hame vpon thys roche. Whan ye beleued the kynge You ye dyd great foly. He wrought great trea&s;on whan he dyd &s;ell you to the kynge Charlemayne that ha|teth
<PB REF="76"> you &s;o muche, for ye loued hym more, than ye dyd your co&s;in Maw|gys. He hath well rewarded you for the great loue that ye ought to him, tell me Reynawde whether ye wyll yeeld you or defe~de you? Certes &s;ayd Reynawde now &s;peke ye for nought, I &s;hall neuer yeeld me as longe as I am a liue. Reynawde &s;ayd than, O|gyer what wyll ye doo? wee cannot helpe you of nothynge, other gyue your &s;elfe vp: or defende your &s;elfe, Ogyer &s;ayd Reynawde, by hym that made the worlde I &s;hall neuer yeeld me. I was neuer no theefe and ther|fore wyl I not be hanged, I haue le|uer dye like a knyght than to hange lyke a theefe. Lordes &s;ayd Guimard let vs &s;awte them, for they &s;hall not may kepe longe agayn&s;t vs. Lordes &s;ayd Ogyer ye maye well &s;awte the~ if ye wil, but bi my &s;oule I &s;hal doo the~ nothyng, for they ben my co&s;ins nor I &s;hall not helpe theym. For ye &s;hall take them well wythout me. Certes &s;ayd y^e Frenche men, we &s;hall than a&s;&s;ayle them worthely. Than Ogyer drewe hym&s;elfe and all hys folke a &s;yde, wel the length of a bow &s;hot, and began to make &s;o great &s;o|rowe as thoughe all the worlde had fini&s;&s;hed afore hys eyen, and all hys &s;orow was for Reynawde hys co|&s;yn and for hys brethern, and thus as he made his mone: he began for to &s;aye. Ha fayre co&s;in Reynawde it is great pitie of your death. And I vnhappy ma~ that am of your kynne &s;uffre you to dye afore myne eyen, &amp; yet I cannot helpe you, for I haue it promy&s;ed to Charlemayne, nor I ought not for to breake myne othe. But the hi&s;torye telleth that Ogyer duaange him&s;elfe greatly that day, And through his purchace the foure &s;onnes of Aymon &s;caped. For yf he wolde haue put payne to it: they &s;hould not haue &s;caped by no maner but as men &s;ayd. True bloud maye not lye.</P>
<P>BEfore the roche were foure Er|les, for to &s;awte the foure Son|nes of Aymon, and made them mo|che a doo. For theyr folke &s;awted the~ in foure partyes. Wherof Reynawde kepte the two partes: and Alarde &amp; Guycharde kepte the other tweyne. For Richarde lay downe vpon the erth &s;ore wounded, as I tolde you a|fore. And yet was Guicharde wou~|ded &s;ore throughe the thye wherof he had bled &s;o longe y^t ye was feynt and fell downe to the erth. And wha~ he &s;awe that he myght no more de|fend: he began to cal vpo~ Reynawde and &s;ayde. Ha Reynawde fayre bro|ther, let vs yeeld vs I pray you, for I nor Richarde maye no more helpe you. Brother &s;ayd Reynawde what &s;ay you? now &s;hew ye wel that ye be ferdfull, but I let you wyt that yf I trowed to &s;cape other for Golde, or for Syluer or for Citie or for Ca&s;tel+les, or my hor&s;e Bayarde that I lo|ue &s;o muche: I &s;hould haue yeeld me pri&s;oner to daye in y^e mornynge. For ye wot well that yf we ben take that all the golde that is in all the worlde &s;aue vs not fro hangynge, or &s;ome other &s;hamefull death, and therfore I wyll not yeeld me by no maner of wy&s;e. A man that wylbe valyaunte
<PB N="lxxi" REF="76"> ought to defende hym&s;elfe for to be whole. Ha Richarde &s;uccour vs for the loue of Ie&s;us, for wee haue well mi&s;tre: we ben nother Norma~s nor Bretons, but we ben all of one fa|ther and of one mother. Now ought we well to helpe eche other with all our power for our wor&s;hip, for other wy&s;e men &s;hould &s;ay that we ben ba|&s;tardes, and of an yll father. ye &s;aye trouthe &s;ayde Guicharde. But ye wolde not beleue how feble I am, for I am wounded to the death.</P>
<P>Certes &s;ayde Reynawde, I am &s;ory for it, but I &s;hall defende you as longe as life is in my bodi, who had &s;een than the noble knight Reinawd take vp the great &s;tones, and ca&s;t the~ vpon hys enemyes: ye wolde not haue &s;ayd that he had not be wou~ded nor trauayled of nothing. Whan Ri|charde (that lay a ground thus wou~|ded as I haue tolde you aboue) &s;aw and heard the great noy&s;e that they that &s;awted the roche made: he tooke vp his head and &s;ayd to Reynawde. Brother I &s;hall helpe you. But cut me &s;ome of my &s;herte, &amp; I &s;hal binde my &s;yde and wounde &s;o that my bo|welles may not y&s;&s;ue out of my beli and than I &s;hal &s;et me to mi defence and &s;hall helpe you with al my hert. Than &s;ayd Reynawde, nowe art y^u well worthe a true man. And whan Guycharde vnder&s;toode hym: he was a &s;hamed and tooke agayne &s;trength in him beyonde hys power and came to the defence and &s;ayde w^t a high voice Ogier fayre co&s;in what doo you to your lynage? Certes it &s;halbe a great &s;hame to you yf ye &s;uc+cour vs not, for the faute that ye doo to vs: &s;hall be layde vnto you in euery place where ye goe, to let vs dye thus we that ben your kynne&s;|men, the be&s;t of all the worlde, &s;aue Reynawde &amp; ye &s;hall doo like a true man, and as for vs other: it maketh nother le&s;&s;e nother more. Whan O|gier vnder&s;tode the&s;e wordes: he was &s;ory for it, that no man might more, and wolde haue gyue a great thing for to haue deliuered them. And &s;aid that he wolde doo wyth all his herte all that he might doo for them. And tha~ Ogyer &s;purred Brayforde with his &s;purres and came to the roche w^t a &s;taffe in his hande, and &s;ayde to the~ that &s;awted the roche: wythdraw your &s;elfe a litle tyll I haue &s;poken wyth them a litle, for to wyt whe|ther they wyll giue them &s;elfe vp or no. For it is better that we haue the~ quicke than dead. Sir &s;ayd the Fren+che men we &s;hal doo your commau~|dement. But wee leaue them wyth you to keep in the name of the kynge Charlemayne. Ha god &s;ayd Ogier I neuer thought trea&s;o~, nor I &s;hal not begyn yet. And than he came more nighe the roche than he had be, and called to hym the foure Sonnes of Aymon, and &s;ayd to theym. Fayre co&s;yn re&s;t you, and take agayne your brethe, and yf ye be hurt: wrappe vp your woundes, &amp; make good garni&s;|&s;hinge of &s;tones, &amp; &s;o defende youre &s;elfe nobly of al your power, for if y^e king Charlemayne may haue you: ye &s;hall neuer haue pardonne, but he &s;hal make you to be hanged &amp; &s;tran|gled, and therfore ye mu&s;te needes
<PB REF="77"> kepe your &s;elfe well. For I promi&s;e you yf Mawgis know of it: he &s;hall come to &s;occoure you, thus &s;hall ye &s;cape. &amp; other wy&s;e not. Co&s;en &s;ayd Alarde, ye &s;hall haue of it a good re|warde yf euer we may &s;cape, ye &s;aye true &s;ayde Reynawde. For yf I mai &s;cape bi god that &s;uffred death &amp; pa&s;|&s;yon for vs vpon the Cro&s;&s;e, all the golde of the world &s;hal not &s;aue him but I &s;hall &s;lea hym wyth myne own handes, for I hate hym much more than I doo a &s;traunger. For he that &s;hould helpe and defende me agayn&s;t all men it is he that doth me harme Co&s;yn &s;ayd Ogyer I maye not doo therto, &s;o helpe god my &s;oule. For y^e kyng Charlemayne made me &s;were afore all hys barons that I &s;hould not helpe you in no maner of wy&s;e.

And al&s;o it was well trouth that Ogyer was repreued therof for trea&s;on, for char|lemaine called him traitour afore al his barons. Than Reynawde bou~<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e the wou~des of his bretherne as wel as he could. But the wounde of ry|charde was &s;o greefully to &s;ee that it was pitie to beholde, for all the en|trayles appered oute of hys bodye. And whan he had lapped theym al: Alarde wrapped the wounde that Reynawde had in the thyghe, and whan they had re&s;ted them&s;elf a litle Reynawde &s;toode vp and went vpon the roche for to gather &s;tones to de|fende them &s;elf. And garny&s;&s;hed ther w^t theyr defence where his bretherne &s;hould &s;tande. Whan the Frencheme~ &s;awe y^e Ogyer the Dane made there to longe a &s;oiournynge: they began all to call and crye. Ogyer ye make there to longe a Sermon, tell vs yf they wyll yelde them or no, or yf they &s;hall defende them&s;elfe. Naye &s;ayde Ogyer as longe as they haue lyfe in theyr bodyes. By my &s;oule &s;ayde the Frenche men than go we &s;awte them efte agayne. Than &s;ayde Ogier I promi&s;e you I &s;hal helpe them with all my power. Whan the Erle Guy|marde hearde Ogyer &s;peake &s;o: he wente to hym &amp; &s;ayd. We commau~de you in the kinges name of Fraunce that ye come to the batayle wyth vs agayn&s;t the foure &s;onnes of Aymon as ye haue promi&s;ed and &s;worne, &amp; for doubt of you many a lord is here in your company that wyll not fy|ght. Lordes &s;ayd Ogyer for god mer+cy, ye know wel al redy they ben my co&s;yns germanye. I pray you let vs withdrawe our &s;elfe a backe, and let them be in peace, and I &s;hall gyue eche of you large goodes, Ogier &s;aid the frenche men we &s;hall not doo &s;o, but we &s;hall brynge them pry&s;oners to the kynge Charlemayne that &s;hal doo with them hys plea&s;ure, and al|&s;o we &s;hall tell him what ye haue do|one. Wherof he &s;hall conne you lytle thanke all his life. And after whan Ogier vnder&s;tode the&s;e wordes: he was &s;ore an angred &amp; &s;ayde by great wrathe. By the fayth that I owe to al my freendes if there be ani of you &s;o hardy that take Reynawde or any of this brethern for to delyuer them to king Charlemayne I: &s;hall &s;myte of his head, what &s;ome euer come af|ter it. Ogier &s;ayd y^e Erle Gu~ymarde
<PB N="lxxii" REF="77"> we &s;hal not leue therfore for to take them ryght &s;hortly. And whan we haue them: we &s;hal &s;ee who &s;hal take them from vs, for we &s;hall well can &s;hewe this to the king Charlemain. And than they began to &s;awt the ro|che agayne. Wit it that Reynawde &amp; hys brethern defended themfelf full nobly. But whan Reynawde &s;awe this great multytude of folke that came for to &s;awte them: he began to &s;aye. Ha Mawgis my fayre co&s;yn where are ye now that ye knowe not thys my&s;hap? for ye wolde come a|non to helpe vs: but ye know it not, wherof I am euyll contente. For I was a foole and ouer ha&s;ty that I &s;pake not to you of thys matter a|fore that I came heere. Ha Bayarde yf I were vpon your backe I &s;hould neuer entre w^tin this roche for feare of the frenchemen, but y^e king Char|lemayne &s;hould le&s;e heere of the be&s;t knyghtes of his company, &amp; whan he had &s;ayde this: he began to weepe full tenderly for the loue of his bre|thern, y^t he &s;aw &s;o &s;ore wounded and &amp; &s;o werye. Than the Frenchemen &s;awted them efte as &s;tronge agayne &amp; I promi&s;e you if it had not be the greate prowes of Reynawde: they &s;hould haue ben take~ at that time by fine force. Whan the &s;awtinge was fini&s;&s;hed: Reynawde &s;et him&s;elf vpo~ his defence, for he was &s;o wery that if he had gone he &s;hould haue fallen downe to the erthe, &s;o weke he was and that was no meruayle: for they had &s;o &s;ore trauayled him, &amp; had &s;uf|fred &s;o many tormentes and terrible &s;awtes that it was wunder y^t they coulde endure &s;o longe.</P>
<P>ANd whan Ogyer the Dane &s;aw his Co&s;in &s;o &s;ore torme~|ted: he tooke him&s;elf to weepe tender|ly. And thus as he wept: he bethou|ght him &s;elfe of a great wy&s;edome &amp; called to hym a knight of hys that was named Gerarde &amp; &s;ayd to hym, haue for god mercy of me. and but yf ye doo that I &s;hall tel you: I am di&s;|honoured for euer more.

<P>NOw &s;heweth the hy&s;tory that whan Godarde &s;aw Reynaw|de and his brethern go to theyr death thorough &s;o fal&s;e a trea&s;on: he had of it great &s;orowe and pitie, and he was ryght &s;ory for it, for two pryn|cipal cau&s;es, wherof thone was for his may&s;ter the kynge Yon, that had wrought that &s;hamefull trea&s;on: and the other was for the great pitie and domage y^t it was for to make die &s;o pitiou&s;ly &s;uche worthy knyghtes as the foure &s;onnes of Aimon were. So began he to weep pitiou&s;ly, and thus as he wept, came there Maw|gys the co&s;yn of the foure &s;onnes of Aymon that went to the kechyn for to ha&s;te the meate, for the kinge Yon wolde eate, to the whyche men made good cheere, bycau&s;e they knew not the trea&s;on that he had doone. Whan the clerke &s;awe Mawgys: he called hym, and &s;ayd to hym. Ha Mawgys how it is yl with you? for if god put no remedy in you ye haue lo&s;te that

Certes &s;ayd Godarde ye &s;ai trouth. For the lettre &s;heweth that Ogyer the dane and Foulques of Morillon are &s;et in a bu&s;&s;heme~t with a great numbre of folke in the plaine of Valcolours and Reynawde and his brethern are gone thyther al vnarmed by the cou~|&s;ell of kyng Yon, and thus they can|not defende, but they mu&s;te be dead or take~. Wha~ Mawgis vnder&s;toode thys: he was &s;orye for it that he fell downe in a &s;woune to therth, and at the fallyng that he made he brake all hys browes. And whan he was com agayne to him&s;elfe, he was &s;o &s;ory y^t he wy&s;t not what he &s;hould doo. So tooke he a knife and wolde haue &s;ho+ued it in hys bre&s;te, but he myght not for Godarde tooke hym by the hand and &s;ayd to hym. Ha gentyll knyght haue mercye vpon you, kyll not your &s;elfe, for your &s;oule &s;halbe da~p|ned for it, but light a hor&s;backe and take wyth you all the men of armes that ben within and the good hor&s;e bayarde that renneth &s;o fa&s;t, and goe there as your co&s;yns ben gone as &s;oone as ye may. And whan ye com there, ye &s;hal &s;ee anon yf ye can helpe them or not, for yf they ben alyue: ye &s;hall &s;uccour theym ryght wel. Go|darde &s;ayd Mawgys your cou~&s;el is right good, and tha~ he began to weep and &s;aid. Ha noble knight Reynawd it is great dommage yf ye be dead, but I make my vowe to God that if ye and your brethern be dead: I &s;hall neuer liue two dayes after you. And than Mawgys without any noy&s;e or onye worde to be made of this to kyng Yon nor to his &s;y&s;ter the wife of Reynawde: co~maunde all the &s;ol|diours of the ca&s;tell to be redy in ar|mes lightly, and whan the knightes vnder&s;tode hym: they tooke theyr har+neys on in contynent as they were wo~t to doo. And whan they were all armed thei came al to the lowe&s;t part of the palays and pre&s;e~ted them&s;elf, and whan Mawgys &s;aw them: he &s;hewed to them all the trea&s;on that the king you had doone to Reynawde and to his brethern.</P>

And whan Rowland and O|liuer &s;awe come Ogier thus woun|ded and making &s;o euill chere: they trowed that there hadde be a battaile and that Ogier had taken Reynawd and his brethrene, and &s;o they dyd calle the Duke N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">imes, Salomon of Breten, Richarde of Normandye and the earle Guidellon. And whan they were all a&s;&s;embled: they &s;aide the one to the other. Poore vnhappy and what &s;hal we doo? this day &s;hall we &s;ee hanged the foure &s;onnes of Aymon, they be co&s;ins to vs al, and if the king Charlemain maketh the~ to be hanged: we be di&s;honoured for euer. And whan the king Charle|mayne &s;awe come Ogier: he &s;aid to him, Ogier where ben the foure &s;on|nes of Aymon? haue ye taken them, or &s;laine theim, or remy&s;ed theim for pri&s;oners? Sir &s;aide Ogier all fayre and foftlye, wit it that they been no children: but they are the be&s;t knigh|tes of the world, and they be alyue. I tell you &s;ir that we founde them in the plaine of Valcolours, all foure clothed in &s;carlet furred with ermi|nes and vpon mules, and bare in their handes floures, and ro&s;es, wel hath the king of Ga&s;coygne kepte his couenaunt to you, for he hath &s;e~t

And whan Reinawde had goten a hor&s;e: he &s;lew Foulques of Moryllon fir&s;t of all, and mounted vpon his hor&s;e, but at the la&s;t they found a roche cor|uen after the maner of a caue that is a &s;trong place, where they defended them&s;ele a longe while, and Richard one of their bretherne had ben &s;laine, and the other three &s;hould haue be~ o|ther taken or &s;laine, and if Mawgis had not come there to &s;uccoure them mounted vpon bayard and broughte with him .v. thou&s;ande knyghtes which haue di&s;comfited vs and haue &s;laine the Erle Guymarde.</P>
<P>HA &s;aid themperaur Charlemai|ne is it true that they been &s;o &s;caped? &s;ir &s;aid Ogier, yea vere+lye, whan the king vnder&s;toode that Reinawd and his brethern were &s;ca|ped: he was right wroth &amp; ful angry for it and &s;aid. A good lord of glorye, how am I &s;hamed for foure glutto~s? certes this weries me &s;ore, but no force let them doo the wor&s;t that they can for if they haue &s;caped me now: they &s;hal not &s;cape me another time, &s;yr &s;aid Ogier wyt it, but if Maw|gis had not be: they coulde not haue &s;caped, Goddes cur&s;e haue he for it &s;aid Charlemaine and an euyll yere, for often hathe he holpen them ayen&s;t me, and &s;o I wote well that yf I helde Reinawde and hys bretherne within my pry&s;on. Mawgis &s;hould delyuer theym oute, and therfore I hate him to death, wherof I pray out lorde that I die not till I be fyr&s;t a|uenged of it, &s;yr &s;aide Ogier by the faith that I owe to you. Reinawde gaue me &s;o greate a &s;troke that the corner of my helme fel downe wyth|all to the earthe, and I promy&s;e you I was wel glad wha~ I was e&s;caped from his handes, for of three thou|&s;and that we brought with vs: there are come againe but three hundred, &amp; the &s;urples is all &s;laine other taken.

Than &s;ayd he a good rea&s;on as a noble knight. Lordes &s;ayd Reynawde to hys bre|thern &amp; to his knightes, Now heare what I wyll &s;ay to you. Ye knowe how I was di&s;herited at paris wro~|gefully vpon a fea&s;t of Pentheco&s;te that Charlemaine helde open court and full in hys palays, where was a compani of great lordes. For there were .vii. hundred knyghtes all gen|tilmen bothe of name and of armes and a hondred what of Dukes and of Erles, and more than foure &s;core by&s;&s;hopes, and many barons, &amp; that tyme was &s;layne the duke Benes of Aygremount myne vncle that was &s;o good a knyght as men knew wel. I dyd a&s;ke right for him to Charle|mayne afore all hys courte: wherof the kynge rebuked me and called me all to nought, and greate iniurye he &s;ayd to me. And whan I &s;awe that y^e kyng repreued me thus: I was wro|the and right angry for it, &amp; I beheld vpon my brethern and knewe theyr &s;tomackes, and &s;aw myne enemyes before me, &s;o neded not that I &s;hould haue &s;ought them els where. And it &s;uffi&s;ed theym not of that I had be outraged by Charlemayne: but that Berthelot outraged me of newe, he and I playinge at the Che&s;&s;e, wher|of I tooke y^e che&s;&s;e boorde and &s;mote hym with it &s;o greate a &s;troke vpon hys head that I &s;lew hym afore my feet. And Lewes a nother neuew of Charlemayne wolde haue &s;layne my brother Richarde and had hurte hym all redy full &s;ore. But I &s;mote hym in &s;uche wi&s;e with my fy&s;t y^t I feld him downe dead afore me to therth, &amp; whan Charlemayne wy&s;t of it: he wolde haue made me to be killed &amp; hewed into peeces, but my kyn&s;eme~ wolde not &s;uffre it, for there was great medlyng &s;o that many &s;trokes were gyuen. And whan the medling was ended: I mounted vpon Bay|arde &amp; my brethern I made to mou~t al&s;o thone before &amp; the two other be|hynde me, and thus rode we al foure vpon my hor&s;e bayarde, &amp; &s;o came to Ardeyne, where I dyd buylde a ca&s;tell. And there Chaylemane ca|me and be&s;eeged me, and made &s;we|re mi good father Aimon y^t he &s;houl|de neuer helpe vs wyth none of all his goods, and that he &s;hould be vt|terly ayen&s;te vs and in lyke wi&s;e he for clo&s;ed me fro all my kyn&s;men y^t none of them was not &s;o hardy for to haue &s;hewed to vs y^e lea&s;t fauour

For god made neuer &s;o good a man, but that, that he mi&s;doeth by euyll coun+&s;ell &s;omtyme.

Therfore I pray you all that ye wyll make you redy, for I wyll goe &s;uccour him. For it were great repro+che to my chyldren that theyr vncle &s;hould be hanged as a theefe, and it were to vs a great di&s;&s;honour, for he is our lord, and if he had doone euil: we ought to doo well agayn&s;t it, and al&s;o we ought not to forget the bene+faytes that the kynge yon hath doo|ne to vs, and I promi&s;e you that the faute and the trea&s;on that he hath doone is not come through his ma|lyce, but through euyll coun&s;el. For yf it had be onlye by hys mocyon: I wolde &s;ee the hert from the bodye of hym, but I wot wel nay, for Char|lemayne is of &s;o great power that e|uery man feareth him.

For Reinawde fought not, for to loke the better vp|on him. And thenne Rycharde that thought hym &s;elfe neuer wery of ge|uyng of &s;trokes: began to calle vpon his brother, and &s;aide. Reynawde faire brother where ben youre greate &s;trokes gone that ye were wunt for to gyue vpon youre enemyes. Alas &s;mite now vpon them, for they been almo&s;t ouercome, make that the fren|&s;hemen full of pride mocke not with you, and &s;o make we &s;uche a thinge that it be &s;poken of it vnto Parys.

For I feare you not of nothyng, but l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e vs make an ende of our bataylle. And to whome god gyueth the victo|rye: let him haue it. Rowland wolde not doo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word">, but dyd lyke a curteous knighte, and he dyd as the barons had &s;ente him worde. For he tooke a &s;pere and ranne vpon Reinawde as much as he myght. And whan Rei|naude &s;awe he wold none otherwi&s;e doo: he ranne al&s;o with a &s;pere vpon Rowlande, and rought eche other &s;o wonderful hard that they made theyr &s;peres to flee all in peeces, and whan they had broken their &s;peres: they re|countred eche other with theyr &s;heel|des &s;o &s;tronglye that both theyr hor|&s;es, that is to wit Bayard and Me|lantes &s;takered, and were all a&s;toni|ed therwithal. But with that &s;troke Rowland and Melantes were both felled to the grounde on a heape, and Reinawd pa&s;&s;ed forth by the~ cryinge with an high voyce Mountawban. Wherby I tell you for certayne that Rowlande neuer felle downe for no &s;troke of &s;pere: but onely that tyme. but it was no meruaile.

<P>REynawde was not contente whan he vnder&s;toode the ylle wordes of Rowlande, and &s;hooke al for angre, and incontinent ranne vp on Rowlande and gaue him &s;uche a &s;troke vpon his helme: that he all to bru&s;ed it, and the &s;troke &s;lided vpon the &s;heelde &s;o that he cut of it a great quarter, and of the cour&s;et of &s;teele al|&s;o, but he cut nothinge of the fle&s;he. And whan Reynawde hadde gyuen Rowlande that &s;troke: he &s;ayde in maner of a mocke to Rowlande, what &s;aye ye by my &s;werde, doo it cut well or no? for I haue not mi&s;&s;ed at that &s;troke, now keep you well fro me, for I am not &s;uche a childe as ye take me for.

<P>IN this parte &s;heweth the hi&s;|tory that after Reinawd was departed from the bataylle for to goe fight body to body ayen&s;t Rowlande the neuewe of the king Charlemati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the wood of the &s;erpente: Row|land, Olyuer and Ogier the Dane, fought ayen&s;t Alarde, Guycharde, and the litell Rychard, ayen&s;t Maw|gys and ayen&s;t theyr folke, and the batayle was there &s;o &s;harpe and &s;o fell of one parte and of the other, &s;o that greate hurte and &s;cathe was there made of both partes, but at the la&s;te the dy&s;comfyture turned vpon Rowlande, and vpon his folke.

So tooke he hys &s;werde and ranne vpon Ogier for to haue &s;miten him vpon the head. But wha~ that Oliuer &s;aw this: he tooke Row|land by the bridell, and the erle Gui|dellon tooke Ogyer, and thus they

Kni|ght an&s;wered Rowland. I graunte therto by my faith. And than they &s;purred their hor&s;es with their &s;pur|res, and Rowland came ayen&s;t Ry|charde &s;o harde that he ouerthrewe hym and his hor&s;e with all in a hepe to the grounde.

And whan he was on hor&s;e backe he &s;et hande on his &s;werd and defended him &s;elfe nobly again&s;t hys enemy Rowland.</P>
<P>WHan Rowlande &s;aw thys, and that he knewe that it was one of the bretherne of Reynawde: he had &s;o great ioye of it that him &s;e|med that he had been in Parady&s;e, and incontinente he beganne to crye Mountioyc &s;aynt Denys. And &s;aid, vpon him nowe my frendes, for yf he &s;cape vs: I &s;hall tell it to the king Charlemayne. And whan that the fren&s;hemen &s;aw that Rowland wol|de haue taken Richard: they &s;ette al, vpon him, &s;o that they &s;mote hym wyth more then foure &s;werdes al at once, and it happed &s;o that his hor&s;e was kylled vnder hym, and he ouer|throwen to the erthe. And whan that Richard &s;aw his hor&s;e dead a grou~d: he was ryght &s;ory for it, and ro&s;e vp quickelye vpon his feete, and &s;mote the erle Anthony &s;o greate a &s;troke with his &s;werd that he wounded him ryght &s;ore. Humall the breton &s;awe that: &amp; he &s;mot Richard, and Richard recouered vpo~ him with &s;uch a &s;tro|ke that he felled both hor&s;e and man to the erthe. And with this: Guidello~ came from behynde and ouerthrewe Richarde fro the ar&s;ons of hys &s;adle to the grounde. And whan Rowland &s;aw Richard at the ground: he came to hym and &s;ayde. Nowe yeeld you and abyde not that we &s;lea you, for it were great domage, &s;yr &s;ayd than Richard the yonge&s;t &s;onne of Aimon to you Rowlande I &s;hall yeeld me &amp; to none other. For I ca~ not yeeld me to no better man than ye be one. And with this he tooke him his &s;werde, &amp; Rowlande receyued it with a good wyll and made the lytell Rycharde to light vpon a mule. And thus they hadde hym pry&s;oner. Alas and what a domage &s;hall it be yf the prue Ry|charde be hanged? he is well lyke to be, but that god &amp; Mawgys delyuer hym, all this my&s;happe &s;awe a &s;er|uaunte of Richarde.

Syr I bringe you euell tydynges wyt that Rowlande leadeth wyth hym your brother Rycharde for pry|&s;oner well &s;hamefully. Whan Rey|nawde vnder&s;toode the&s;e wordes: he was &s;ore angry for it, that he had al|mo&s;te lo&s;t his wytte, and after he

Syr &s;ayd the ye|man, yea, it is not po&s;&s;yble that ye &s;houlde ouertake theim. And whan Reynawde vnder&s;tood this: he was more angry than he was tofore, and fell from bayarde in a &s;woune to the erthe. And whan he was come again to him &s;elfe: he behelde afore hym. And &s;awe his broher Alarde come with his folke that came after Rey|nawde by the tra&s;e. For they wende that Richarde hadde be gone to hym longe afore them.

Alard &s;ayd Reinawd, ye haue doone ful yl, for I haue left my brother Richarde with you to keep hym, and ye haue lo&s;t him, for Rowland ledeth him with hym as pri&s;oner, and he is all ready &s;o ferre brought that we can nor &s;uc|cour hym, whan Alard, &amp; Guichard vnder&s;toode the&s;e tydynges: they beganne to make &s;uche a &s;orow that it was meruaile for to &s;ee the lamen|tacion that thei made, alas &s;ayd Rei|nawde, what is he that hath parted our company? to day in the morning we were foure bretherne togyther &amp; nowe we been but three. Ha fayre brother Richard it is greate domage of you, for if ye had liued your age: ye &s;hould haue pa&s;&s;ed all your brethern &s;eyng that ye were the yonge&s;t of vs all and yet ye were the mo&s;t hardye, and throughe your hardynes: ye are taken, fayre brother &s;ayd Alarde, all cometh by you that brought vs heere ayen&s;t our wyl for to &s;uccour the ki~g yon.

Brother drawe out your &s;werde &s;o &s;hall we cut of the head of thys traytoure kinge yon therwith, for whome we haue nowe lo&s;t our brother Richarde, brother &s;aide than Reynawde.

And thus as the three bretherne made theyr mone for Ry|charde, came there Mawgys theyr co&s;in y^t folowed them, &amp; when he &s;aw his co&s;ins make &s;uch &s;orow: he was &s;ore a ga&s;t and &s;aid to them.

<P>NOw telleth the hi&s;torye, that whan Mawgys was come againe to Mountawban: he was &s;o much wrothe that he myght no more for y^e loue of Richard that was take. And becau&s;e that Reinawde and his bretherne made therfore &s;o great &s;o|rowe. Incontinente that he was lyghted from hys hor&s;e, he went in to his chambre and made hym &s;elfe to be di&s;armed and after he tooke of all his clothes, and put him &s;elfe all naked, and this doone: he tooke an herbe and eate it, &amp; as &s;oone that he had it: he &s;welled like a padde, and than he tooke an other herbe, &amp; chau|fed it and helde it betwene hys teeth, and anon he became al blacke as a cole in his face os one that is beaten with &s;taues, &amp; his eyen reeled in hys

And thus arayed: he i&s;|&s;ued out of Mountawban.

<P>VA&s;&s;ail &s;aid the kinge Char|lemayn god confounde you for I &s;hall neuer tru&s;te vpon &s;uche a begger as ye be, bycau&s;e of the euyll theef Mawgis, the whiche hath de|ceyued me many times, for whan he wil, he is a palmer a knight or a gri|fon or elles a heremyte, by &s;uche ma|ner that I canne not beware of hym And if it plea&s;e god &amp; his ble&s;&s;ed mo+ther I &s;hal auenge me once vpon him howe that the game goeth. And wha~ Mawgys hearde the Emperoure &s;peake of this maner: he an&s;wered nothynge, and kepte hym &s;tyl a great whyle, and after he &s;ayd to the king. Syr yf Mawgys be a theefe all o|ther poore folke be not &s;o. I haue more need of helthe, than I haue to doo any trea&s;on, and it is well &s;een on me that I am not the bodye that might doo any great harme. Syr I come from Iheru&s;ale~, where I haue wor&s;hypped the holy graue, and ha|ue doone my oblacions in the temple of Salomon, and yet I mu&s;t goe to rome and to &s;aint Iames in galyce &amp; God will. But I dyd pa&s;&s;e ye&s;ter|daye ouer balancon and ouer Giron|de, with .x. men my &s;eruauntes that I ledde alwaies by the waye with me for to keep &amp; defende my bodye.

And after I a&s;|ked of the folke of the countrey what menne they were that &s;o hadde &s;laine my men, and they dyd tell me that they were the foure &s;onnes of Aymo~ and a greate theefe that was called Mawgis with theym. And I a&s;ked them why they wold &s;et them&s;elfe to &s;o foule a craft &amp; vnhappy, &s;een that they were &s;o greate gentilmen born? and the people of the cou~trey an&s;wer|de me that they were con&s;trained for

But I did neuer &s;ee &s;o cruel a man as the &s;ame Mawgys is, for he bounde my han|des behinde my backe whan he had robbed me, and tha~ he bet me &s;o &s;ore: that I weened to haue dyed therof, and hath araied me as ye &s;ee. Syr ye be the be&s;t kynge in the worlde and ye be the lorde of all this land, wher|fore I pray you for god that ye wyl doo me ryght of the&s;e four &s;onnes of Aymon and of Mawgis that greate theefe. And whan Charlemain vn|der&s;tood the&s;e wordes: he ryghted his heade vp, &amp; &s;aid. Pylgryme is it true as thou &s;aie&s;t? yea &s;ir &s;aid Mawgis. Nowe tell me thy name &s;aid Char|lemayne. Sir &s;aid Mawgys, my na|me is Gaidon, &amp; I am borne in Bre|tayne &amp; I am a great man in my con|trey, wherfore I require you in the wor&s;hyppe of the holye &s;epulcre that I haue &s;ought: that ye doo me ryght. Pylgrime &s;ayde Charlemaine I can not haue no ryght of them my &s;elfe, for I promy&s;e thee if I had them: all the worlde &s;hould not &s;aue them, but that I &s;houlde make them dye a &s;ha|meful deathe. Syr &s;ayde then Maw|gys, &s;ith that ye can do me no ryghte of theym: I be&s;eche almightye god that is in heuen that it plea&s;eth him for to doo it. Syr &s;aide the barons thys pilgrime &s;emeth to be a good man and a true as we &s;uppo&s;e. For it is well &s;een on him, geue to hym your alme&s;&s;e yf it plea&s;e you. And thenne the kinge commaunded that men &s;hould giue him twentye pound of money, and Mawgis tooke them and put it in his hoode, and he &s;aide in him&s;elfe, ye haue gyuen to me of your own good but ye haue doon like a foole. I &s;hal rewarde you ryght e|uel for it or euer I departe fro you, &amp; whan he had the &s;yluer: he a&s;ked for &s;ome meate for gods &s;ake, and oure ladyes, for &s;ythe ye&s;terdaye he hadde not eaten as he &s;aid, by my faith &s;aid Charlemaine thou &s;halt haue meat &amp; drinke ynoughe. And anon they did brynge him meate, and he &s;ette him downe and tooke and eate wel of the be&s;t. And the king &s;aide to him nowe eat free good pilgrim. For thou &s;halt be wel &s;erued, and Mawgys eat &s;tyl &amp; an&s;wered neuer a word but beheld onely the king in hys vy&s;age. And the kinge &s;aide to him tell me Pyl|gryme and hide no thynge from me, whi ha&s;t thou loked &s;o on me? &s;ir &s;aid Mawgis I &s;hall tel you with a good wyll. Wyt that I am a wel trauayl|led man, but in no place that euer I was, I &s;aw neyther chri&s;ten man ne &s;ara&s;yn &s;o goodly a prince, ne &s;o cur|teous as ye be one, wherof of all the pardones that I haue wonne in my vyage makinge.

<P>ANd whan Ogier &amp; E&s;torfawd the &s;onne of Oedon, and the duke Naimes &s;aw that Row|land wold goe to the pauilio~ of char|lemaine with Richard: They came to Rowlande and &s;aide to him.

And the&s;e wordes hearde a yoman, that incontinent &s;purred his hor&s;e, and came to the kinges tent, &amp; &s;aid to Charlemayne. Syr I bringe you tydynges &s;ore &s;traunge, we haue foughten by the ryuer &s;yde of Balancon, where that Reinawd the &s;onne of Aymon hath keept his own right well ayen&s;t Rowland your ne|uew, and &s;etteth not a &s;traw by him.

<P>CHarlemayn began than to lepe for Ioye whan he vnder&s;toode the&s;e tydynges, and came out of his tent, and behelde and &s;awe Rychard that Rowlande broughte, and whan Charlemayne &s;awe Richarde: he knewe him well incontinente, and began to crie for greate Ioye that he had.

I feare me not to be hanged as longe as my brother &s;hal may lyght vpon bayard and that Mawgys be alyue, Alarde, and Guicharde my ryghte deare bre|thern, for if ye do to me any outrage: no ca&s;tell, ne town, ne fortre&s;&s;e &s;hal not keep you, but they &s;hal make you dye an euell deathe or two dayes be pa&s;&s;ed. Whan Charlemayne heard Richard &s;peake &s;o proudlye: he was ryghte an angred for it, and tooke a &s;taffe with bothe hys handes and &s;mote Richard therwith vpon hys heade &s;o hard that he made the bloud renne out of it to the earthe, and wha~ Richarde felte him&s;elfe thus woun|ded: he vaunced him &s;elfe, and tooke themperour Charlemain with both the

Syr ye haue doone ouermuche amys, for to beate a pry&s;oner. Certes my lordes &s;aide Richarde it is more dy&s;honoure to the kynge to &s;mite me, than it is to me for to defende my bodye, but he is well wunt to doo &s;uche outrages, for it is not the fyr&s;te that he hathe doone, nor it &s;hall not be the la&s;t. And whan Mawgis &s;awe that Charle|mayn had &s;mytten Rychard: he was &s;ore an angred therfore, that he had al|mo&s;t layed vpon him wyth his pal|mers &s;taffe, but he thought yf he had doo &s;o: bothe Richarde and he &s;houlde haue be dead. And whan Charlemai|ne &s;awe that Richarde &s;pake &s;o bold|ly: he &s;ayde to hym. Rycharde God confounde me, yf ye &s;cape me for all your wickednes, for ye &s;hall &s;oone be ha~ged by the necke. Syr &s;ayd Richard &s;peake more courteou&s;lye yf it plea&s;e you. For I &s;hal &s;ee you &s;ooner be flein quicke than ye &s;hall &s;ee me hange, nor ye &s;hall not be &s;o hardye to doo &s;o, what &s;omeuer ye prate, &s;aye or cra|ke. Charlemayne &s;ayd, ye &s;hall not &s;cape me but ye &s;hall be hanged or nyghte, and wolde God I helde as fa&s;t youre bretherne, and Mawgys that theef as I holde you nowe, for they &s;houlde be hanged wyth you to beare you company, becau&s;e ye &s;hould not be afetde. And thus as Rycharde &s;troue with Charlemayne: he turned hym&s;elfe and &s;awe Mawgys behin|de hym that helde him &s;elfe &s;tyll le|nynge vpon hys &s;taffe, and he knew hym well wherof he was wel gladde for he wy&s;t well he &s;houlde not dye &s;yth Mawgys was there. And wha~ Richarde had &s;een Mawgis: he was &s;ure of his lyfe, and &s;ayde to Charle|mayne. Syr where &s;hall I be han|ged tell me? certes &s;ayd Charlemaine at the gybet of Mountfawcon &amp; there &s;hall your brethern maye &s;ee you, and Mawgys youre co&s;yn. Syr it is no rea&s;on that &s;uch a ma~ as I am &s;hould be hanged, but make peace with vs &amp; ye &s;hal doo wy&s;ly, and yf ye doo not &s;o: ye &s;hall &s;ore repente it as I trowe. And whan Mawgis had hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e all that he wolde heare: he made no lon|ger taryinge, but he went out<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the pauyllion and &s;ayde no worde, and whan he was out of it: he beganne to walke &s;o greate a pa&s;e that no hor&s;e myghte not haue folowed hym, and pa&s;&s;ed throughe the wood of the &s;er|pent and dyd &s;o muche that he came to Mountawba~, where he found Rei|nawde and his folke that wayted for him. And whan Reinawd &s;awe him come without Richarde: he was full &s;ory &s;o that he fell do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ne in a &s;wou|ne. And Alard and Guycharde tooke hym vp and &s;aide to him. Fayre bro|ther ye doo as a chylde, ye oughte not to make &s;uche a &s;orowe. Holde your peace traytours &s;ayd Reynawd for ye haue lo&s;t the be&s;t knyghte of the worlde, for I &s;ee Mawgis come alone, wherfore I beleue that Richa|rde is deade, for yf he were a lyue: Mawgys wolde haue broughte hym with him. For he neuer my&s;&s;ed of no
<PB REF="98"> thing that he tooke in hand. And wha~ Alard, &amp; Guychard vnder&s;tood the&s;e wordes: they tooke therof &s;o greate a &s;orowe that they fell both downe in a &s;woune to the earthe, and whan they were come againe to theim &s;elfe they made &s;o great &s;orow that it was pytie for to &s;ee. And this ha~ging: cam there Mawgis. And whan he &s;awe the great &s;orow that his co&s;yns made: he was wrothe for it, and &s;ayde to them. What eyleth you faire co&s;yns that ye make &s;o euill cheere. Alas Mawgys &s;aid Reinawd, what is doone of oure brother Richard. Co&s;yn &s;ayd Maw|gis Richard is yet in pri&s;on, but Char+lemaine hath &s;aide that he &s;hall make him to be ha~ged at the gybet of mou~t|fawcon, and hathe &s;ayde that ye &s;hall not keepe him longe a liue le&s;te ye and I &s;hould re&s;cue him, and heere is .xx. li. of money that Charlemayne hathe gyue me in his pauillion and made me haue both meat, and drynke, at my plea&s;ure. Nowe &s;hall it be &s;een yf ye loue Richard, &amp; if ye be a good knight or not, for ye mu&s;t &s;uccour and deliuer him by force of armes or elles he &s;hal die, for all the world &s;hal not keep him otherwi&s;e therfro.</P>
<P>REinawd was wel recomforted whan he heard Mawgis &s;pea|ke: and after he &s;ayd, &s;ith that it is &s;o y^e Richarde is yet aliue: if I had but my &s;elfe, my brethern, and Mawgis, yet &s;hould I keep Richard fro death maw+gre the power of Charlemayne, &amp; tha~ Mawgis without any longe abiding tooke of his cope &amp; his hod, and tooke an herbe &amp; eat it, &amp; anon the &s;wellinge went fro him, &amp; whan he was armed: he pre&s;ented him&s;elf to Reinawd, and incontinent all his brethern put them &s;elfe in armes, and anon they tooke their way toward mountfawco~. And whan they were come to a bowe &s;hot nyghe fro it: Reynawde &s;ayde to hys folke. Lordes if ye euer loued me: thin+ke for to doo nowe &s;o muche that my brother Richard may be re&s;cued from this &s;hamefull death. For I promy&s;e you that I &s;hal brynge hym with me, or els I and my bretherne and Maw|gys &s;hall die with him. Syr &s;ayde his men doubte not of vs, for we &s;hal doo oure deuoyre.

<P>HOw they were &s;ent to y^e plaine of Valcoloures ye haue well hearde, and the paine that reynawd &amp; his bretherne &s;uffred and than howe they wente and &s;uccoured kynge yon of Ga&s;coyn that had betrayed theim.

<P>NOw &s;hal we tel you of Char|lemaine that was in his pa|uyllio, he called to him the duke Nai|mes and Richard of Normandy and &s;aide to them. Lordes what coun&s;eil gyue you me? ye knowe that Richard the &s;oone of Aymon is of great pow|er, I feare me that Reynawde &s;hall come to &s;uccoure hym, whan I &s;hall &s;ende him for to be hanged, and ther|fore I mu&s;t &s;end company for to with &s;tande Reynawde, his bretherne and Mawgis. And thus as the king and the duke Naymes &s;pake togither: he looked before him &amp; &s;awe Berenger of valoys, and called him and &s;aid to him. Berenger ye are of my men for ye holde of me &s;cotlande &amp; Wales, ye oughte to come &s;erue me in Fraunce with all youre power euery yere once whan I haue need.

And yf reynawd com there for to re&s;cue hym: I praye you that ye wil take in hand my quarell. Syr &s;aid Berenger I &s;ee well now that ye loue me but a lytell, whan ye &s;ende me to doo &s;uche a deed, it were to me a great &s;hame yf I dyd it, for nothynge that is to my dy&s;wor&s;hippe I wyll not doo wyth my good wil, and al&s;o ye ought not to coun&s;eyll me to it nor &s;uffre me to doo &s;o, yet haue I leuet to &s;erue you as my dutye is for to doo, than that I &s;hould doo the &s;ame that ye wolde put me to. And whan Charlemaine &s;awe that Be|renger wolde not doo it: he called to therle Guydellon &amp; &s;aid to him. Gui|dellon ye be my man and holdeth Ba+uyere of me, and ye ought to &s;erue me at any time that I call you with three thou&s;and men, yf ye will goe hange Richard the &s;onne of Aymon: I &s;hall make you free, and &s;hall giue you the citie of Ma&s;con. I wil not doo it &s;aid therle Guydellon. But I tell you for certeine that Richarde &s;hall haue no harme if I may help him fro it to my power. Than &s;aide Charlemayn goe oute of my &s;ighte for ye be no good men. And than he &s;aide to Rycharde by god yet &s;hall ye be hanged in di&s;|pyte of theym. Than called Charle|mayne Ogier the dane, and &s;aide to him Ogier ye be my man, it is &s;hew|ed vnto me that ye did the other daye trea&s;o~ ayen&s;t me in the plain of Val-colours for loue of Reynawde, nowe &s;hall it be &s;eene if it is true or not. Yf ye wyll goe hange Richarde: I &s;hall gyue you the cite of Lion, and I &s;hall gyue you quit of al the &s;erui&s;e that ye owe me &amp; youre heyres al&s;o for euer|more.

<P>THan called Charlemayne Sala|mon of breton &amp; &s;aid to him, Sa|lamon ye knowe well that ye be my man and that ye holde Breten of me, I &s;hal giue you the duchie of An|&s;om yf ye will hange rycharde the &s;onne of Aymon.

The whiche thinge all the xii. peeres promi&s;ed hym with a good wyll. And whan typus hadde taken the othe of the .xii. peeres of fraunce for his &s;uretye: he went to his owne tente, and made him to be armed, And whan he was armed: he lyghted on hor&s;ebacke, and came before kyng Charlemain.

And than came the duke Naymes, with the other peeres of Fraunce before the kyng Charle|mayne, and &s;aid to hym. Sir we wil be &s;uretie for Mawgys vpon our ly|ues &amp; vpon our landes that we holde of you that he &s;hall not goe a waye without your leaue, &amp; al&s;o of al your company, and we &s;hall deliuer hym agayne to you to morow in the mor|nynge for to doo with hym what ye wyll. My lordes &s;aide the king &s;ith that ye wyll be his &s;uretie: I remy&s;e him in to your keepynge, by &s;uche a condicyo~, but that I haue him to mo|row in the morning erly: ye &s;hal lee&s;e all your londes. And ye &s;hall ne|uer maye returne in to douce fraun|ce again. Sir &s;aid Oliuer we graunt it as ye haue &s;ayd. Lordes &s;ayde the duke Naymes &s;ith that this is doon: lette vs goe recomforte Mawgys, for he is well &s;ory. Lordes &s;ayd than Mawgis to them againe. Sith that ye haue doon me one good turne: doo me a nother. I pray you get me &s;ome meate, for I am yl a hungred. Whan Charlemayne vnder&s;toode Mawgis &s;peake: he looked vpon hym, and &s;aid all laughinge. And &s;halte thou eate &s;ayde Charlemaine? yea, &s;aid Maw|gis if I can haue any meate. Nowe heare &s;aid Charlemaine, what it is of this deuil heere y^t a&s;keth for meate and &s;o lytell a terme he hath to lyue. For &amp; I were in his plyght: I &s;hould not nowe haue courage for to eate. Syr &s;ayd the duke Naymes ye &s;aye yll, for who hath eaten well: he is the better at his ea&s;e wherof I pray you that ye let him haue &s;ome meat. And thenne the kinge wa&s;hed his handes for to goe to &s;oupper and &s;aid, where &s;hall Mawgis be for to eate? &s;yr &s;aid Rowlande, he &s;hall well be by you.

And than the kinge was &s;ette at the table, and he made Mawgys to &s;yt nexte hym, and &s;er|ued hym at the table, for as longe as the &s;upper la&s;ted: he dur&s;te not eate nor drynke, lea&s;t that Mawgys

And whan Charlemayne hadde ordeyned this: he &s;et him downe vp|on his bedde, and he made Mawgis to &s;it downe by hym. And of that o|ther parte Rowlande, Olyuer, Ogi|er the Dane, and all the twelue pee|res rounde aboute the bedde. Syr &s;ayde then Mawgys, where &s;hal I &s;leep. What &s;ay ye &s;aid Charlemain wyll ye &s;lepe? yea, &s;ayde Mawgys full fayne, if plea&s;e you to &s;uffre me.

And wha~ Row|lande &s;aw Reynawde and hys bre|thern at that time of the night come into his chambre: he was meruayl|led. Neuerthele&s;&s;e he &s;ent for all hys felawes, as Reynawde hadde tolde hym. And whan they were al come: Reynawde &s;toode vp and &s;ayd. Lor|des ye ben all my freendes, god gra|mercy and you, wherof I wyll not hyde nothynge from you. Yee mu&s;t know y^t I haue heere within a pry|&s;oner by whome I &s;hal haue peace &amp; all myne herytaunce agayne. Rey|nawde &s;ayd Rowla~d, I pray you tel me what he his. For heere is no ma~, but that wolde fayne ye &s;hould doo wel. By my &s;oule &s;ayd Reynawde it is the great emperour Charlemayn
<PB N="cxviii" REF="123"> to whome al frau~ce belongeth. And whan Rowland vnder&s;tode the&s;e ti|dinges: he was &s;ore maruayled of it &amp; &s;ayd. Reynawde ye tell me nowe a wunderfull thynge, Howe haue ye taken myne vncle &s;o lyghtly? tell me &amp; it plea&s;e you, how ye had him heere within? haue ye taken hym by force of armes? nay verely &s;aid Reynawd Tell me then how I pray you &s;ayd Rowlande? wit it &s;ayde Reynawde that I wot not howe Mawgys my co&s;yn did to night, but well I wot y^t he hath brought the king heere with|in out of his pauilion, and hath laide him in a bed, in a chambre where he is now fa&s;t a &s;lepe.</P>
<P>WHan Rowland and al his felawes heard the&s;e tidin|ges: they were greatly a|ba&s;&s;hed, how it myght be that maw|his &s;hould bringe the kynge there. I meruayle much ther of &s;ayd the duke Naymes, for ye knowe well that the king made hym&s;elfe for to be kepte bothe night and day well &s;ure. Lor|des &s;ayde than Ogyer, all this hath doone our Lorde for the loue of rey|nawde, bycau&s;e he &s;etteth hym al to mi&s;cheif again&s;t Reynawde and that the warre hath la&s;ted to longe y^e whi|che &s;hal now be left, wherof I tha~ke God for my parte. For manye good knightes haue lo&s;te their lyues for it. And whan Ogier had &s;ayd thus: Reynawde tooke Rowland and the other, and brought theym alwayes &s;peakinge vnto the chambre, where Charlemayne laye &s;o fa&s;te a &s;lepe, that they coulde not awake hym, for nothing that they could doo to him, For Mawgys had charmed hym &s;o harde. And whan the barons &s;awe y^e kinge &s;o harde a &s;lepe: they wundred full &s;ore vpon it, &amp; they were great|ly aba&s;&s;hed of it. Than &s;pake Row|la~d fyr&s;t and &s;ayde Reynawde where is Mawgis that hath wrought &s;o well to night. I praye you let hym come heere, and that he awake mine vncle Charlemaine out of this &s;lepe And whan he &s;hall be awaked: wee &s;hall all fall at hys feete, and &s;hall crye hym mercy. And &s;o I pray you that thoughe yf ye holde mine vncle in your handes, that ye wyll not be the prouder for it in youre wordes, by my fayth &s;yr Rowland &s;ayd Rey|nawde. I wil that ye know I &s;hould rather dye than I &s;hould &s;ay &s;o my &s;ouerayne lorde a foule worde. But I &s;hall put me, my goodes, and all my brethern to his wyll, to the ende that it wyl plea&s;e hym to graunt vs peace wyth him. And I wyll go fet|che Mawgys to you, therto doo with hym what ye wyll. And than Rey|nawde wente and &s;ought Mawgys the whiche he coulde not finde, wher of he was full &s;ory. And whan that the porter wy&s;t that Reynawde &s;ou|ght after Mawgys: he came to hym and &s;ayd. Syr ye &s;eeke hym for nou|ght, for he wente his wayes out ri|ght now. And how knowe&s;t thou of it &s;ayd Reynawde? Syr wyt it that this night he made me open the gate and he we~t out vpo~ your hor&s;e bay|arde. And he had not taryed longe: whan he brought a great man a big+ge vpon the hor&s;e necke afore hym, &amp; went in I wot not where. And &s;oone after he came agayne vpon another
<PB REF="124"> hor&s;e, and he had clothed hym &s;elfe poorely. And than he made me to o|pen the gate, and he wente oute, and he came not &s;ith againe. And al this is trouth that I tell you now.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde had vnder&s;tande the&s;e wordes he was &s;o wrothe y^t he wi&s;t not what to &s;ay nor doo. For he knewe well by hym&s;elf that Mawgys was gon his wayes bycau&s;e he wolde no len|ger abyde the wrathe of Charle|mayne. Than began Reynawde for to weepe full tenderly for hys co&s;in that was thus gone. And all wee|pynge he came againe vnto the bar|ons, and &s;ayde to them how Maw|gys was gone away wythout his knowledge wher of he was &s;o worth and &s;o &s;ori that he went almo&s;te out of his minde. And wha~ Alarde, Guy+charde, and Rycharde had well vn|der&s;ta~de thys: they bega~ for to make great moue, and &s;orowed full &s;ore. And than Richarde began for to &s;ai, Ha my fayre co&s;yn Mawgys what &s;hall we doo from hens forthon? &s;ith that we haue lo&s;te you: we may wel &s;ay y^t we be di&s;comfited. For ye were our &s;aluacyon, our &s;uccours, &amp; oure hope, our coun&s;el, our refute, our de|fence, and al&s;o our guyde. For it is not yet longe ago that I &s;hould haue dyed an euyll death yf I had not be~ &s;uccoured through your helpe. Alas all the heuynes y^t ye bere of the wra|the y^t the kinge Charlemayne hath agayn&s;t you cometh onli by vs. And whan he had &s;ayd &s;o: he knacked his teeth for angre, and &s;ayde. wee ben nowe well all lo&s;t &s;yth that we haue lo&s;t Mawgis. And with this: he &s;et hande to his &s;wearde, &amp; wolde haue &s;layne the Emperour Charlemayne but Reynawde drew him a &s;yde. And the duke Naymes and Ogyer &s;ayde than vnto hym. Rycharde Richarde refrayne your courage. For it were not wel doone for to kyll a man that &s;lepeth. And al&s;o afore that we &s;hal departe hence: we &s;hall &s;et all at one and God wyll. &para; Shortelye for to &s;peake: Olyuer and the Duke Nay|mes &s;pake &s;o fayre vnto Rycharde y^t they made him promi&s;e them that he &s;hould doo no harme to the Kynge Charlemayne. Neuerthele&s;&s;e Ry|charde left not to make great &s;orow for his co&s;yn Mawgys that he had lo&s;t. For al them y^t &s;aw him make &s;o great mone had pitie for to &s;e him. It was no meruayle if Richarde made &s;orowe for Mawgis: For I promi&s;e you he had greate need of hym not longe after. And &s;o had all his bre|thern, as ye &s;hall heare heere after.</P>
<P>ALl thus as the foure &s;onnes of Aymon made theyr moue for the loue of theyr co&s;in Mawgis: The duke Nymes began to &s;peake &amp; &s;ayde in this wi&s;e. By god, lordes ye doo not wel for to make &s;o great &s;orowe. I pray you leue this heuy|nes. And let vs begyn to &s;peake of your peace that mu&s;te be made with the Emperour Charlemayn that an ende maye be hadde of thys warre, that hath endured &s;o longe. By god &s;ayd Rowlande ye be pa&s;&s;ynge &s;low therupon. And al&s;o we mu&s;te fyr&s;te
<PB N="cxix" REF="124"> haue his mercy or euer we moue any thing of the peace. For ye wot wel y^t I left him bycau&s;e that peace &s;hould be made. Syr &s;ayd y^e duke Naymes ye &s;peake wy&s;ely and well, but howe &s;hal we &s;peake wyth hym wythout Mawgys were heere? we cannot a|wake hym. And but yf god remedy|eth it: we &s;hal neuer &s;peke wyth him. But al thus as the barons &s;pake in thys wy&s;e: The charme that Maw|gys had &s;et vpon Charlemayne was come at an ende, and the &s;trength of it was pa&s;&s;ed. And &s;odenly Charle|maine began to moue hys body, and aro&s;e anon vpon his feete, and right &s;ore aba&s;&s;hed looked al aboute him. And whan he &s;aw y^t he was at mou~|tawban in y^e &s;ubieccion of Reynawd the &s;onne of Aymon: he was &s;ore an angred, and made &s;uche &s;orowe for it, &s;o that al they that were there tro|wed that he had ben mad and from hym&s;elfe. And wha~ his wittes were come agayne: he knew wel y^t Maw|gys had doone it vnto hym &amp; &s;ware that as longe as he were manne on liue: he &s;hould make no peace tyl that he were out of Mountawban, and that men had brought Mawgys to hym. And wha~ Rycharde vnder&s;tode this that Charlemayne &s;ayd: he be|gan to &s;aye in this wy&s;e. Howe the deuill dare ye thus &s;peake? &s;yr ye &s;ee well that ye be our pry&s;oner. And yet ye threte~ vs. I make to god mine a vowe and to Saynte Peter, were not that I haue promy&s;ed, that I &s;hal not doo to you no harme at this tyme: I &s;hould &s;trike the head from the bodye of you. Holde your pea&s;e &s;ayd Reynawde, let the kynge Char|lemayne &s;aye his wyll, ye are ouer be&s;y in your wordes. And let vs all pray hym that he wyll pardon vs. For the warre hath la&s;ted to longe, cur&s;ed be he that began it. For great euyles and harmes the whiche are happed therby.</P>
<P>REynawde was wy&s;e, and wel taught for to &s;tylle thus hys brethern, to whome he &s;aid. My lor|des my brethern, yf it plea&s;e you, ye &s;hal come with me, for to cry mercy vnto our &s;ouerayne lorde the Empe|rour Charlemayne. Reynawde &s;aid Alarde, we &s;hall doo all that ye wyl. By mi faith &s;aid the duke Naimes, My lordes ye doo ryght wi&s;ely, and I promy&s;e you that all good &s;hall come to you therof. Than Reynawd and all hys brethren, and Rowland and Oliuer, and Ogyer the Dane, the duke Naymes, the bi&s;&s;hop Tur|pin, and E&s;coufe the &s;onne of Oedo~ began all for to fall on theyr knees, before the emperour. And Reinawde &s;pake fyr&s;te, and &s;ayd in this maner of wi&s;e. Noble Emperour haue mer+cy of vs, for I and my brethern wee yeeld vs to you to doo your plea&s;ure of vs, &amp; your will be &s;o y^t our lyues ben &s;aued: &amp; there is nothinge but y^t we will doo it for the loue of you if it plea&s;e you to graunt vs peace w^t you. And for that piti &amp; pardon that God gaue vnto Mary Magdelene whan &s;he wa&s;&s;hed hys feete in the hou&s;e of Simeon, good &s;yr haue pity of vs. And yf it plea&s;e you not for to pardon me: at y^e lea&s;t pardon my bre+thern. And take them agayne theyr landes, and I &s;hal gyue you Moun|tawba~,
<PB REF="125"> and Bayarde my good hor&s;e And &s;o &s;hall I goe into the holy la~de I &amp; Mawgis, where we &s;hal &s;erue to the Temple of our Lorde. And whan the kinge Charlemain heard Reynawde &s;peake thus: he bla&s;tred all for angre, and &s;ayd by that good lorde that made me, yf all the worlde &s;peake to me therof, yet &s;hould I ne|uer co&s;e~t me to no peace, but I haue Mawgys in my handes for to doo my wyll vpon hym. Alas &s;ayd than Reynawde, now haue I hearde that worde bytynge, wherof I am al de&s;|perate. For I &s;hould rather let my &s;elfe be hanged, tha~ that I &s;hould co~|&s;ente to the death of Mawgys my good co&s;yn. For he hath not de&s;erued towarde vs, that we &s;hould betraye hym, but rather he were worthy by rea&s;on for to be lorde aboue vs. Rey+nawde &s;ayd tha~ Charlemaine, thi~ke not thoughe I am your pry&s;oner y^t ye &s;hall make me doo anye thynge a|gayn&s;t my wyll, &s;yr &s;ayd Reynawd wyte it that myne entente is for to meke my &s;elf toward you for I haue leuer that we &s;uffre wronge of you, than ye of vs, now tell me &s;yr how I &s;hall delyuer you Mawgys that is our life, hope, &s;ucours, our comfort, &s;heeld, our &s;pere and al&s;o our &s;werde our brede, our wyne and our fle&s;&s;he, al&s;o our refute, our may&s;ter our gu|yde, and our defence in all places, wherby &s;yr I tell you that yf ye had all my brethern in your pry&s;on, and that ye &s;hould make them to be han|ged, and that Mawgys were with in my power and with me: yet wold I not yeelde hym vnto you for to quyte wythall my brethern. And al|&s;o I &s;were you vpon my fayth that I wot not where that he is gone, god wot it. Ha &s;ayd the Emperour char|lemayne, goddes cur&s;e haue he, for I am &s;ure he is heere within you, he is not &s;ayd Reynawde I take it vpon my bapty&s;me. And than Rey|nawde turned him&s;elf toward Row|lande and all the other barons and &s;ayd to them. Lordes I be&s;eche you for God that it wyll plea&s;e you for to pray our &s;ouerayne lorde y^e kinge that he wyll haue mercye of me and of my bretherne, to the ende y^e peace maye be had in Fraunce yf it plea&s;e hym. And than Naymes that was kneelinge vpon his knees, and that heard that Reynawde had &s;ayd and wy&s;te well that he &s;pake but well: &s;ayde to the Emperour in this wi&s;e, Syr I pray you that ye wyll not be dy&s;plea&s;ed of that I &s;hall tell you, ye know &s;yr y^t I am &s;uretie for Rey|nawde, and &s;o is Ogyer y^e dane, but me &s;emeth that we ought now to be di&s;charged therof, &s;ith that ye be here pre&s;ente within his ca&s;tell, but ano|ther thynge I wyll tel you, me thin|keth that ye ought to take, that the erle Reynawde proffereth to you or y^t any more harme come to you ther|of, and &s;o helpe me God ye &s;hall doo wel. And al they of your courte &s;hal be glad of it. And whan the barons hearde this that Naymes had &s;ayde to the kinge Charlemaine: they &s;po|ke all and &s;ayde. Syr doo that the duke Naymes hath tolde you, for he hath gyuen you good coun&s;ell and true. And yf &s;o be that ye doo it not: ye &s;hall come to late for to repente you of it.</P>
<P>But
<PB N="Cxx" REF="125"> WHan Charlemayne vnder&s;tode this that y^e duke Naimes had &s;ayd to him: he was ryght wroth of it. For his herte was &s;o harde a&s;to|nyed with great angre: that he tooke no hede of good cou~&s;el, and he &s;ware by &s;aynt Denys of Fraunce that he &s;hould not doo it for no man but yf he had fyr&s;t Mawgys in hys handes for to doo hys wyll ouer hym. And whan Reynawde hearde the&s;e wor|des: he blu&s;tered in his face for an|gre, and ro&s;e vp from kneelinge his bretherne and all the other barons al&s;o. And then Reynawde &s;ayde to Rowlande and to all the other Lor|des that were there. Syr I wyl wel y^e Charlemaine know my wil &amp; my entente, y^e whiche I &s;hall &s;hew afore hym vnto you. Wyt it that &s;yth I ca~ fynde no mercy in him: I praye you that ye wyll not blame me fro~ hence for thou, yf I &s;eeke my ryght. For I &s;hall &s;eeke it in all the maners that a true knight ought to doo. And wha~ Reynawde had &s;ayd this: he turned him towarde the kynge, and &s;ayd to hym. Syr ye maye goe hens whan it plea&s;e you, for by my &s;oule ye &s;hal haue no harme of me now, for ye be my &s;ouerayne lorde, &amp; with good wil we &s;halbe in good peace wyth you.</P>
<P>THe barons of frau~ce y^t were there: wundred &s;ore of the great kindenes of Reynawde. Tha~ &s;ayd y^e duke Naymes, haue ye heard the great humilite of the noble kni|ght Reynawde? By &s;oule &s;ayd row|lande. Reynawde &s;ayth meruaylou|&s;ly. I wolde not haue trowed that he &s;hould euer haue fared &s;o fayre w^t Charlemayne. And whan Rychard vnder&s;toode y^t, that his brother Rei+nawde had &s;ayde: he &s;pake in thys wi&s;e, brother Reinawde I holde you mad. What wyll ye doo? ye &s;ee that we haue in our handes this vengea|ble kyng the whiche we may kyll or els &s;uffre hym to lyue, &amp; yet he is &s;et &s;o &s;ore to pryde that he wyll doo no|thing that his good coun&s;ell telleth hym, but he threteneth vs alwayes more and more, and ye wil let him go thus a waye: &s;urely brother if he &s;ca+peth vs &s;o: he &s;hal yet angre vs right &s;ore, and I promi&s;e you yf he hadde vs as we now haue hym: he &s;hould make vs all to dye &s;hamefullye, not al the golde in the worlde &s;hould not &s;aue vs therfro. And therfore I tell you that ye doo greate folye to let him go thus away. For and ye wyl, ye &s;hall now make our peace, but me &s;emeth, ye &s;eeke none other but your death, wherof I pray god yf ye &s;uf|fre him thus to goe awaye: that he maye make you to dye a &s;hamefull death. And wha~ Reynawd heard his brother &s;peke &s;o: he was wroth &amp; &s;ayd to hi~ in angre. Holde your peace bro+ther for he &s;hall goe his wayes quite will you or no, and the peace &s;hal be made whan he wyll and no &s;oner it &s;hal not be, for there vnto he &s;hal not be compelled of me, and go you hens from me, for your great wordes di&s;|plea&s;eth me.</P>
<P>WHan Reynawde had &s;ayde this: he dyd call a gentylman of hys to whome he &s;ayd, go lightly without any taryenge to the yoman of min hor&s;es, &amp; byd him bringe me
<PB REF="126"> my hor&s;e Bayarde. For I wyll that my &s;ouerayne lorde ryde vpon hym vnto his ho&s;te, for he rode neuer vpo~ no better hor&s;e. And whan Richarde heard this: he we~t fro thens al &s;wel|linge with angre as a fyer&s;full lyon bycau&s;e he knew that Charlemayne &s;hould goe &s;o. And wit it that y^e king Charlemayne hearde and vnder&s;tode well all the&s;e wordes, but he dur&s;te not &s;aye nothyng, &s;o &s;ore he feared y^e fier&s;nes of the yong Richard. This hangyng: came there agayne y^e gen|tilman that was gone for Bayarde whiche he brought with him, &amp; than Reynawde tooke his good hor&s;e bai+arde &amp; came to Charlemayne, &amp; &s;aid to hym, &s;yr ye maye lyght whan it plea&s;e you, and goe at your lybertye, for to comforte your folke, whiche I am fure ben full &s;ory for the taking of you. And whan Charlemayn &s;aw this he lighted anon vpon Bayarde &amp; went out of Mountawban for to goe to his ho&s;te, and Reynawde con|ueyed him to the gate of Mountaw|ban, &amp; whan the kinge was gone: he made the gate to be &s;het anon. And the frenche men that &s;awe their king come agayn: they were right gladde and receyued hym worthely, &amp; after they a&s;ked hym how it we~t with him and yf he had graunted y^e peace lor|des it is wel with me, God gramer|cy, but of peace I haue made none nor neuer &s;hall as longe as I am man a lyue for no man y^t &s;hal &s;peake to me of it, but yf I haue the tray|tour mawgis for to doo with him mi wyll. Syr &s;ayd &s;ome of his barons how haue ye be delyuerd. By my fay|th &s;ayd charlemayn, Reynawde hath delyuerde me agayn&s;t that the wyll of hys bretherne all quite at my ly|bertie. Syr &s;ayd the barons haue ye not &s;een Rowlande, Olyuer, y^e duke Naimes the bi&s;&s;hop Turpin, Ogier the dane nor E&s;couf the &s;onne of oe|don? yea &s;urely &s;ayd Charlemayne, but they haue all for&s;ake me for the loue of Reynawde, wherof by y^t god that hynge vpon the cro&s;&s;e yf I can haue them agayne: I &s;hall &s;hew the~ that they haue not doone well, and whan he had &s;ayd thus: he lyghted from Bayarde and made him to be brought agayne to Reynawde.</P>
<P>ANd whan Reynawde &s;awe bayarde, that Charlemayne had &s;ent hym agayne: he called row|land and his felawes &amp; &s;ayd to the~, fayre lordes I know well that ye be not in the grace of the greate kynge Charlemaine for the loue of me, but I wyll not that ye haue mawgre for me nor for my brethern, and therfore fayre lordes I quyte you all quarel|les that I maye lay vpon you, and gyue you leue to goe whan it plea&s;e you. And whan the Duke Naymes vnder&s;tode the kindnes of the hert of Reinawde that was &s;o noble: he tha~|ked hym hyghly, and ky&s;&s;ed and en|bra&s;ed hym for great loue, &amp; wolde haue kneeled downe afore hym, but Reynawde wolde not &s;uffre hym.</P>
<P>Than the duke Naymes began to &s;aye, let vs thynke to goe after the kyng Charlemayne your vncle, &s;ith it plea&s;e Reynawde to gyue vs leue Naymes &s;ayd Rowlande, how can we doo this, &s;hall we leue Reynawde the whiche ye &s;e myne vncle wyl dy|&s;troye

Certes &s;yr Naymes &s;ayd the barons ye &s;peake wy&s;ely, and ye giue ryght good coun&s;ell. And whan they were accorded to the coun&s;ell of the Duke Naymes: Rowlande a&s;ked after his hor&s;e, and eche of the other barons al&s;o. And whan they were redye for to lyght on hor&s;backe: there came mi lady Clare the wyfe of Reynawde that ki&s;&s;ed Rowlande, Olyuer and all the other barons, and after &s;he &s;ayde to them in this maner.

Madame &s;ayde y^e duke Naymes doubt not. For and god be plea&s;ed the peace &s;halbe made with in the&s;e three dayes. And than they lighted al on hor&s;backe, and the three brethern of Reynawde conueyed the~ to the gate, and Reynawde taryed after them vpon the brydge, &amp; whan they were come to the &s;ayde brydge Reynawde &s;ayd to them, My lordes I commende you to God. I maye no lenger goe with you, prayinge that ye wyl haue me in your reme~brau~ce.

Syr &s;aide the &s;tuarde ye &s;aye well. For ye haue doone &s;o muche ayen&s;te them that al the worlde blameth you therof, but incontinente I &s;hall doo your commaundement. And than y^e &s;tuard went and made the three en|gins to be filled with vittailles, and after he bad the gouerner to ca&s;t the~ in to Mountawban. And ye mu&s;te wyt that many of the ho&s;te blamed Aymon &s;ore, that he made hys en|gynes to be ca&s;te ayen&s;t hys chyldren for they wende it had be &s;tones, and whan the nighte was pa&s;&s;ed &amp; that Reinawd was vp: he went heere and there within the ca&s;tel, &amp; found foi&s;on of vittailes that his father had ca&s;t, wherof he was right glad and &s;ayde Good lorde ble&s;&s;ed be you, now &s;ee I wel that they that haue their tru&s;t in you can not fare amis, &amp; than he cal|led his brethern his wife &amp; his chil|dre~ &amp; &s;aid.

<P>NOw mu&s;t we vnder&s;tond y^t Charlemain had &s;ome know|lege howe the olde duke Aimon had giuen vittailes to his childre~, wher|of he was &s;ore an angred &amp; made Ai|mon to come incontinente afore him &amp; &s;ayd to hym.

Sir &s;aid the duke Aimon, I wil not denie it, for I tell you truely if ye &s;hould make me dye or be brente in a fyre: I will not fayle my chyldren as longe as I maye helpe them. For my children be no theues traytours nor no murderers, but they been the mo&s;t valiaunt knightes of the world &amp; the true&s;t, &amp; ween not you to &s;lea my chil|dren in &s;uche maner, ye haue to longe wrought your foly yf it wolde &s;uffi&s;e you. whan Charlemayne heard Ay|mon &s;peake thus: he was angrye with it, &amp; for great wrath he loked as fire &amp; Almo&s;t he &s;mote Aimon, &amp; wha~ the duke Naimes &s;aw this: he auau~|ced him forth &amp; &s;aid. Sir &s;ende home Aimon for ye haue kepte hym heere to lo~g, ye ought well to vnder&s;tande that Aymon wil not &s;ee his children to be dy&s;troyed, and therfore ye ought not to blame him nor &s;mite him, after that Charlemayne hearde the duke Naimes &s;peake: he &s;ayd to him. Nai|mes &s;yth that ye haue iudged it: ye &s;hall not be gayn&s;ayd, &amp; than he tur|ned him towarde the duke Aymon &amp; &s;ayde to hym. Now goe forth out of myn ho&s;te, for ye haue doon me more domage than profyte, &s;ir &s;aid the du|ke Aimon. I &s;hal gladly doo your co~|maundemente. And anon he went &amp; lighted on hor&s;ebacke, and after &s;aid to the peeres of fraunce. Lordes I pray you al that ye wil haue my chil|dren for recomme~ded, for they be~ com of your bloude, &amp; let the king &s;ee well to, for yf he make my children to dye by &s;uch great vengeaunce as he hath &s;ayd: if I &s;houlde become a &s;ara&s;yn &amp; dwel in Affryque al the dayes of my lyfe: I &s;hal &s;tryke of his head, for no|ne other gage I wyll not take. And whan Aimon had &s;aid thus: he went out of tho&s;t into fraunce to his coun|trye wel heuy bicau&s;e that he left his children in &s;o great pouerty, &amp; Char|lemayne that &s;awe Aymon goe thus quite, and that he hadde garny&s;hed Mountawban of vitaylles: he was full angrye for it. So &s;tudyed he vp|on this a longe whyle. And whan he had &s;tudyed longe ynoughe: he was &s;o &s;ory that none myght be more &s;ori|er, and returned hym &s;elfe towarde hys Barons, and &s;ayde Lordes I commaund you that ye breake al our engynes.

For if ye were with vs we &s;houlde doubte nothinge nor I &s;houlde not &s;uffre this great di&s;tres that I haue. All thus as Reinawde complained hym&s;elfe: than came Alard that was &s;o feble that with payne he mighte &s;tande vpon his feete, and &s;ayde to Reynawd.

<P>IN this party &s;hewed the hi&s;to|ry that whan the kynge Char|lemaine was at y^e &s;iege before Mou~|ntawban &s;ore an angred y^t he coulde not take Reinawd nor his brethern.

And whan he &s;aw that: he was aba&s;&s;hed of it, &amp; came to the pauilyon, and &s;ente In|continent for all hys barons. And whan they were come: he &s;ayd to the~ Lordes it is wel nyghe eyght dayes age y^t I &s;aw no body vpon the wal|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s of Mountawban, wherefore I beleue that all they of it be dead. Syr &s;ayde the Duke Naymes, it were good that men wy&s;t the trou|the of it: &s;ende thether &s;yr if it plea&s;e you. Whan Carlemayne hearde thys: he lyghted anon on hor&s;backe and all hys Barons wyth hym, &amp; wente to Mountawban. And whan they were come vnto the gate: they made &s;emblaunte to giue a &s;awt to the Ca&s;tell, but Reynawde was to ferre for to defe~de it. And than Char+lemayne wende verelye that Rey|nawde and all hys had ben dead for hungre &amp; great di&s;tre&s;&s;e, he made to be brought thether a longe ladder and righted it to the walles. And in|contynent Rowlande mounted vp fyr&s;t of all, and after him Ogyer, O|liuer, and the Duke Naymes. And whan they were vpon y^e walles: thei
<PB N="cxxx" REF="135"> behelde within, and they &s;aw nother man nor woman, and &s;o they wente downe from the walles, and yede &amp; opened the gate, and made Charle|mayne to come in and all his folke. But wyt it that Charlemayne we~t in as angry as any man myght bee. And whan he was within &amp; founde no body: he was &s;o &s;ore merueyled that he wy&s;t not what he &s;hould &s;ay nor doo. So wente he vp to the dun|geon and he founde there no bodye, wherof he was more meruayled tha~ he was afore, and than he began to &s;ay. By my &s;oule Lordes heere is great meruayles and wel the deuyl|les werke. Wyt it that Reynawde is gone and all hys brethern, and all hys folke al&s;o. And all this hath doon that theef Mawgys that hath ben here within, for it can none other wy&s;e be.</P>
<P>AFter that Charlemayne had &s;ayd the&s;e wordes: he began to walke within the Ca&s;tell &s;ekynge all aboute to &s;ee yf he might finde Reynawde or any of his bretherne. And &s;o longe he wente thus heere &amp; there that he founde the waye there as they went out, &amp; whan the kynge Charlemayne &s;aw the caue: he was &s;ore aba&s;&s;hed with it and called O|gyer the dane &amp; &s;ayd to him. Ogyer heere is the way where thoroughe y^e traytours are gone awaye, and all this hath doone me Mawgis. For he hath made this caue in dy&s;pite of me wherof he maketh my hert to breke in my bely. Syr &s;ayd the duke Nay|mes, ye blame Mawgys, but thys Caue &s;heweth not that it had be vn|made this hundred yeres pa&s;&s;ed, and I tell you for certayne that &s;ara&s;ins made it fir&s;te. Whan Charlemayne hearde the&s;e wordes: he beganne to &s;mile with an angri fare, and cur&s;ed them that made the Caue, and was meruaylou&s;li an angred, for he knew well that Reynawde and all his co~|pany were gone out at the &s;ame hole and &s;o he was di&s;my&s;&s;ed of his pur|po&s;e, he &s;ayd then to his folke.

And wha~ Rowland vnder&s;tode Charlemain: he put hym &s;elfe wythin the Caue, and made lyght a great many of tor|ches for to &s;ee in it, and after Row|lande went plentie of Frenthe men that folowed hym, and they wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o longe til they came at the ende of the caue, &amp; founde them&s;elf in the wood of the Serpente.

Wit that Rey|nawde and his folke are &s;caped you and they haue Bayarde with them for heere ye may &s;ee the path. And whan the king Charlemayne knew the trouth how Reynawde and hys co~pany were gone: he was &s;o great|ly an angred y^e none might be more, and the &s;ame houre he &s;ent his me&s;|&s;angers in all his landes and coun|treis for to wit yf he might vnder|&s;tande any tidinges where Reinawd and his brethern were become. And whan he had doone thys: he co~mau~|ded that his ho&s;te &s;hould dy&s;lodge, &amp; that they &s;hould come all to Moun|tawban. And whan y^e barons heard the king: they did his commaunde|ment, and came al to Mountawban &amp; lodged them as wel as they could, &amp; abode wel there &s;ix dayes making great Ioye that Reynawde and hys bretherne were thus expelled out of it. And as the barons were deui&s;ing wythin Mountawban there came a me&s;&s;anger to fore Charlemayne, and &s;alued him as to him apperteyned, and to him he &s;aid in this wi&s;e. Sir wyt it that I haue &s;eene Reynawde Alarde, Guieharde, and Richarde lo+kynge great to ye with great compa+ny of knightes, keping a great cour+te within the citie of Ardeyne, where as Reynawde gyueth great gyftes to euery one. And I am &s;ore meruey|led where he hath gotten &s;o greate trea&s;ur. And al&s;o is there with him the kyng Yon of ga&s;coygne and that more is I tell you for certayne that Reynawde hath made a great a&s;&s;e~|ble of folke for to defend hym agai~&s;t you if ye go in any wi&s;e for to a&s;&s;aile hym.</P>
<P>THe kinge was muche angry wha~ he heard his me&s;&s;angere &s;o &s;ware he by &s;aynt denis he &s;hould neuer lye in no bed tyll he had be&s;ye|ged Ardeyne. And whan he &s;ayd &s;o: he commaunded to his barons that euery ma~ &s;hould tru&s;&s;e his baggage and they &s;hould take on theyr waye &s;treyght to Ardeyne. And whan the barons heard Charlemayne &s;peake &s;o: they tooke on theyr way without any more taryinge towarde Ardein and rode &s;o longe tyll that they cam to mountarg weil, y^t was not ferre from Ardeyne, for men might &s;ee from thens the &s;teples of the towne There was lodged the ho&s;te of char+lemayne that nyght, and I promi&s;e he did doo make good watche, for doubt of the foure &s;onnes of Aymon And wha~ the day was come Charle+mayne did &s;et his folke in good orde|naunce, &amp; with his baner dy&s;played they rode towarde Ardeyne. And whan Reynawde wy&s;t that Charle|maine was come for to be&s;iege them within Ardeyn: he began to &s;were y^t he &s;hould not let him be&s;ieged as he had doone within Mountawban. For rather he wolde fight w^t Char|lemayne. And if it may &s;o falle that he come in his handes: he &s;hall not haue pitie of him as he had to fore tyme bycau&s;e he had founde him &s;o cruell and without pitie.

And whan his army was a&s;|&s;e~bled in the feeldes: it was a noble thynge for to &s;ee, and than he ordey|ned hys batayles bi good ordenau~ce as a wi&s;e fighter. And after he had doone &s;o: he called his brethern and &s;ayde to them. My fayre bretherne this daye is the day that we &s;hal die or els doo &s;o muche that we &s;hall bringe the warre at an ende.

<P>NOw &s;heweth the hi&s;tory that whan Mawgys was in his hermitage, &amp; had watched &s;o longe about hys prayers to God: he fell a &s;lepe, and him &s;emed in his &s;lepe that he was at Mountawban and &s;awe Reynawde and his brethern y^t came agayn&s;t him, and made theyr com|playnt

And than he &s;ware our Lorde he &s;hould neuer cea&s;&s;e to goe tyll he had &s;een Reyna|wde and hys brethern his good co|&s;yns. And whan Mawgis had &s;aid &s;o: he made none other tarying, but he &s;het the doore of hys chapell, and tooke his weede and hys &s;taffe, and went on his waye al&s;o &s;oone as he myght. And about y^e houre of noone he founde hym&s;elfe in a great wood where he founde two men makyng euyll cheere and great &s;orow, &amp; wha~ Mawgys &s;awe them: he cam to the~ and &s;ayd?

Good Syrs &s;ayde Mawgys what eyleth you y^t ye &s;peake &s;o. Good man &s;ayd y^e one of the two, a litle before you: are the|ues y^t hath robbed vs of our clothe and haue &s;layne one of our felawes bycau&s;e he &s;peake to them angrely. Whan Mawgys heard thee&s;e poore marchau~t&abis; &s;peke thus: he had great pitie of them and &s;ayd to them. My freendes come with me, I &s;hal pray the theeues in our Lordes behalfe y^t they wyll delyuer you agayne your goodes, and yf they wil not doo it: I &s;hall be wrothe with the~, &amp; &s;o I &s;hall fight w^t the~ wel as I can w^t my &s;taffe for to wit yf theyr heades ben &s;oft or harde. Whan the marchau~tes hearde Mawgis &s;ay &s;o: they began to looke vpon hym if they could know him, but they might not knowe what he was. Then &s;pake to hym one of the~ in this maner, and what deuyll is that ye &s;ay? thou art but a man alo|ne all naked and they ben all armed and al&s;o ye can &s;cantlye heaue vp your &s;taffe.

And whan Mawgys &s;aw the marchaunt &s;peke thus to him: he &s;ayde. Brother thou doo&s;te not wel to &s;peake to me &s;o, for by force thou cannot get ought of me. And thus departed Mawgys from the marchauntes, &amp; went hys way &s;o muche y^t he ouertooke y^e thee|ues and &s;ayd to them. Lordes God &s;aue you. I pray you tell me whye ye take a way y^e goods from the&s;e mar+chauntes? ye know well y^t it is not yours, wherfore I pray you let the~ haue agayne theyr goodes and their marchau~di&s;e, &amp; god &s;hall conne you thanke. Whan y^e theeues heard maw+gis &s;peake to them thus: they were angry for it. And behelde vpon maw+gis from ouer the &s;houlder as he had be a Sara&s;yn.

<P>ANd whan the marchauntes &s;aw this that Mawgys had doone: they were right glad of it. So came they towarde Mawgys and kneeled before hym and cryed mercy of that they had &s;aid to him.

Stande vp tha~ &amp; take with you your goodes agayn and god be with you, but I pray you tell me or ye go yf ye wot not, where is Charlemayne. Syr &s;ayd the mar|chauntes, we wot wel that Charle|maine hath taken Mou~tawban, but we promy&s;e you he hath not yet ta|ken none of the foure &s;onnes of Ay|mon: for they were gone out w^t their folke through a caue vnder the erth, that they found vnder the walles of the Ca&s;tel vnto the Citie of Ardeyn where as they ben now. And Charle|mayne hath layde there his &s;yege a|fore them, &amp; will not make no peace with Reynawde nor wyth his bre|thern. Certes &s;ayd Mawgys I am &s;ory for the~, for they ben good knigh+tes and true. Whan Mawgis vnder &s;toode that Charlemayne had be&s;ye|ged Reynawde within Ardeyn: he co~+mended the marchauntes to God &amp; tooke his way towarde Ardeyn, and &s;o muche he went that he came into the ho&s;te of Charlemayne, and went &s;treyght towarde the Citie, &amp; made &s;emblaunt to be &s;ore feble, for he we~t lenynge vpon his &s;taffe. And whan the folke of the kynge Charlemayne &s;awe Mawgys goe thus: they loo|ked &s;ore vpo~ him and &s;ayd thone to the other, that pilgrim is lyke for to goe ferre, he cannot &s;tande vpon his feete. By my othe &s;ayd another it might well be Mawgis that is &s;o dy&s;guy&s;ed, for to dy&s;ceyue vs. It is not &s;o &s;aid y^e other. Mawgis is not aliue. And while y^t thei deui&s;ed thus together: Mawgys came neere to y^e wicket of the gate, and founde the meanes that he gat in anon. And whan he was within Ardeyn: he we~t vnto the Palays. Where he founde
<PB REF="141"> Reynawde and the duche&s;&s;e his wife and bothe theyr children Aymonet and Yonnet, and their vncles his co+&s;ins, w^t a great meyny of noble kni|ghtes that were all at theyr meate. Whan Mawgis had looked a while vpon them, he lened agayn&s;t a piller that was in the middes of the halle afore Reynawde. Than began he to looke agayne vpon his fayre co&s;yns y^t he loued &s;o muche aboue all thinge of the worlde. And whan the Mar|&s;hall of the halle &s;aw Mawgys, we|ning to him y^t it had be a poore here|mite: he commaunded that he &s;hould be &s;erued of his dinner for Goddes &s;ake. And whan Mawgis &s;awe the meat that was brought him, he &s;aid my lordes I be&s;eche you for the loue of God that it wil plea&s;e you for to bringe me &s;ome browne bread and water in a trene di&s;&s;he, and thus I &s;halbe &s;erued as vnto me appertey|neth. For I dare not take none other meat. And whan y^e &s;tewarde of Rey|nawde &s;aw that, he made him anon to be brought al that he wolde haue. Than tooke Mawgys the browne bread and made &s;oppes in water, &amp; eate of it with a good appetite. And whan y^t Reynawde &s;awe thys poore man afore him that liued &s;o poorely and was &s;o lene and &s;o pale: he had of him great pitie. So tooke he a di&s;he that was before him that was full of veny&s;on, and &s;ent it to hym bi a &s;quier of his that pre&s;ented it to hym &s;ayinge thus, holde good man the duke &s;endeth you this, god yelde him &s;ayd Mawgys, and than he too|ke and &s;et the dy&s;&s;he afore hym, but he eat nothing of it. And whan Rey|nawde &s;awe that: he was greatlye meruailed, &amp; &s;aid to hi~ &s;elf. god who is that good man that liueth &s;o hard a life, if he were not &s;o leue: I &s;hould &s;ay that it were my good co&s;in maw+gys, but a nother thing &s;heweth me that it is not he. For he wolde not hyde hym&s;elfe from me in no wy&s;e.</P>
<P>REynawde behelde &s;til Maw|gys &s;o muche that he left his mete for to looke vpo~ him. And wha~ the tables were taken vp, &amp; that e|uery man had eaten at his ea&s;e: they went to their warde for to defende the towne as they were wonte for to doo, in theyr harneys. And wha~ Rey+nawde &s;awe that euerye man was gone, and that there was no body w^t in the halle for whome he wolde leue for to &s;ay hys will: he went to maw|gys and &s;ayd to hym, good heremite I pray you for the reuerence of that God that ye &s;erue that ye tell me yf ye be Mawgys or no, for ye are well lyke him. Wha~ Mawgys heard Rei|nawd &s;peake thus to hym: he could hide him&s;elfe no lenger, and &s;ayd al on hye. Co&s;yn I am Mawgys wythout doubt.

And whan Reinawde &s;awe them: he was glad and ky&s;&s;ed them thone after the other, and after he tolde them al that the king Charlemayne had giue him to knowe, and whan the brethern of Reynawde vnder&s;toode it: they mer|uaylled of it, brother &s;aide Rycharde doubte not, for the mater &s;hall come better than ye weene of, by the grace of god. I coun&s;eyll that we goe to the court of the kyng Charlemayne. For whan we &s;hall be there we &s;hal &s;oone vnder&s;tonde the kinges mynde, and what his will is towarde you, and I promi&s;e you, yf he hathe doone anye wronge to our neuewes your childre~ god neuer haue mercye on my &s;oule, but I &s;hal &s;lee him, what hap therof Brother &s;aide Reinawde I wyl wel that we goe to Paris, and whan we &s;hal be there, we &s;hal wel vnder&s;tond how the kinge Charlemaine bereth him&s;elfe toward my chyldren. Bro|ther &s;ayd Alard, ye &s;peake well &amp; wi|&s;elye, &amp; me &s;emeth after myne adui&s;e that we ought to goe thither without anye longe taryinge. And whan they were there to accorded: they departed fro Mou~tawban with a right noble company, and &s;o muche they rode by their Iourneys that they came to the citie of parys. And whan they were come there: al the .xii. peeres knew a|non of their coming, and went ayen&s;t them, and brought with them Aymo|net &amp; yonnet, and receyued Reinawd &amp; his bretherne with great ioye &amp; ho|nour. And whan Reynawd &s;aw his two fayre &s;onnes: he &s;aid to them in this wi&s;e. My children now &s;hal it be &s;een if ye be my &s;onnes or no. For and ye be my chylderne, ye &s;hall auenge me of that great &s;hame that the&s;e trai+toures put vpon me without a cau&s;e. Father &s;aid the chyldren: doubte not therof, for &amp; they were .x. ayen&s;t vs, yet &s;hall we ouercome theym by the grace of god. For euerye man know|eth well that ye be as true a knyghte as any is in the worlde. And whan the kynge Charlemaine knewe the comyng of Reinawd that was come &s;o well accompanyed: he was gladde of it, and &s;ent worde to Reynawde that he &s;hould come to him, the which thynge Reynawde dyd, and whan the kyng &s;aw him he made him good chere and with good hearte, and al&s;o to his brethern. And whan Reinaw|de had be with the king a longe whi|le: he tooke leue of him &amp; went to his lodges again, and wha~ he was there he callede his bretherne and his chil|dren &amp; &s;aid to them. My &s;onnes come hither, tell me how the kynge Char|mayn bereth him&s;elfe towarde you, &amp; what he &s;ayth of this quarell that ye haue vndertake. I mu&s;te knowe
<PB REF="167"> the trouth of it.

And than they tolde him how he had ma|de them knightes, and how he &s;u&s;tei|ned their quarell ayen&s;t the traytou|res, and all other.</P>
<P>WHan Reinawde and his brethern heard the childre~ &s;peake thus: they were glad of it, for they doubted le&s;t Char|lemaine wolde haue faten euell with them. And whan Reynawd of mou~|tawban wi&s;t that the king had borne hym&s;elfe &s;o wel toward his &s;onnes: he &s;aide that he &s;houlde &s;erue hym e|uermore as his &s;ouerayne lorde. And on the morowe Reinawde went for to &s;ee the king at his ri&s;yng from his bed and thanked him muche of the greate wor&s;hyp that he had doone to his chyldren. Than &s;aid Charlemai|ne to him. Reinawde euer &s;yth that I &s;awe that ye dyd my commaunde|mente with good wil, &amp; that ye were obeynge to me: I dyd ca&s;te all myne angre from me, and all the euyll wyll that I had ayen&s;t you, and I wil that ye wit that I am wel yours, and &s;hal be as longe as I lyue in this worlde, for I take you for one of my be&s;t freendes. And whan Reinawd heard y^e debonairtie and the kinde wordes of the king: he ca&s;t him&s;elf to the feet of him, and in lykewi&s;e dyd all hys bretherne, and thanked him muche, &amp; wyt that Reinawd &amp; his bretherne abode in parys with greate Ioye and plea&s;ure vnto the daye of the batayll that &s;houlde be of his childerne. And this hangyng: Reynawde had doon make good harnays for his chyldren and had pourueyed two good hor&s;es for them.</P>
<P>THan whan the day of the ba|tayll was come: the chyldren of Foulques of Moryllon came and pre&s;ented them afore the kynge redy for to fyght. And whan the kyng &s;aw them: he &s;aide to theim.

For I am &s;ure, it &s;hall repent you, but this is not the fir&s;t faut that your lygnage hath doon, nor it &s;hall not be the la&s;t. I feare me of it. And whan the earle Guanellon &amp; al they of y^e lygnage of Foulques of morillon heard the king &s;peake &s;o: they were &s;o greatlye aba&s;|&s;hed, y^t thei wi&s;t not what thei &s;hould doo, but kept al their peace, &amp; a&s;we|red no word. And than &s;aid Con&s;ta~s to the king. Syr we pray you for god that ye wyll telle to vs the place where we &s;hall fight ayen&s;t our ene|mies. Than &s;tood vp the duke Nay|mes of bauyere, &amp; &s;aid, &s;yr Con&s;tans &s;peaketh well, ye mu&s;t deui&s;e the pla|ce, and where they &s;hall fyght two a|yen&s;t .ii. or one ayen&s;t a nother alone. Naymes &s;ayde the kyng, I wyl that ye Iudge this matter, &s;ir &s;ith that it plea&s;e you &s;o: I &s;hal be&s;peake it with a good will. Syr &s;aid the duke Nay|mes, me &s;emeth, bycau&s;e that Con|&s;tans hath called the &s;onnes of Rey|nawd to batayl both for one mater: that they ought to fight two ayen&s;t
<PB N="clxii" REF="167"> nawde to battayl both for one matter that they ought to fyght two ayen&s;t two, and al foure togyther. Syr &s;ayd Reynawde, the duke Naymes &s;ayth ryght well. By my fayth Reinawde &s;ayde the kinge Charlemayne, and I graunt it &s;o, but I wyll that the ba|taylle be made in the y&s;le of our ladye within &s;auoine to morow in the mor|nynge. And whan the kynge Char|lemayne had &s;ayde thus: the barons tooke leue of him, &amp; eche of the~ went to their lodges, and Reinawde al&s;o the which tooke his two &s;onnes with him, and the two &s;o~nes of Foulques of Moryllon went al&s;o with theyr freendes. Whan Reinawde and his bretherne had &s;ouped, and had made good there: he made brynge harneis ynoughe, and made Alarde and Ry|charde, and hys two chyldren aymo|net, and yonnet, to be armed. And tha~ he made to be &s;hewed to Aymonet and to yonnet howe they &s;houlde de|fende them&s;elf of their enemies, and in what maner they &s;houlde a&s;&s;aylle them. And wha~ that this was doon: Reynawde dyd &s;ende hys chyldren to &s;ainte Vyctoure and the traytoures went to &s;aynt Germayne for to wat|che that nyghte. And whan the daye came: a by&s;hop that was of the lyg|nage of Con&s;tans and of rohars &s;an|ge ma&s;&s;e afore his co&s;ins, &amp; the by&s;|&s;hoppe Turpyn &s;aid ma&s;&s;e affore the &s;onnes of Reinawd, which was with them at &s;aint Victoure, and al&s;o the tuelue peeres of Fraunce. And whan the yonge knightes had hearde the ma&s;&s;e: they came al in their harnays to the palays before the kynge Char|lemayne. And whan the kynge &s;awe them: he called his neuew Rowland and Olyuer, the duke Naimes of ba|uyete, and Richarde of Normandye, and &s;ayde to them. Lordes ye ben all my menne. I commaunde you vpon the trouthe that ye owe to me, that ye goe keep the feeld by &s;uch maner that my honoure be &s;aued by it, and that ye keep to euery man his ryghte. For by the fayth that I owe to god, yf the+re be any man &s;o hardy that wyll doo any outrage: I &s;hall angre hym right &s;ore. Wherfore I wyll that ye pa&s;&s;e the water of Sayne, in to the ylle wyth the fyghters and that ye beare wyth you the halowes, for to make theym &s;wete there vpon, a fore they &s;hall entre in to the feelde, that they goe to it all in good quarell truly. Sir &s;aide the barons, we &s;hall doo youre commaundemente, and al&s;o we &s;hall keep therin well your honour, for we ben bounde therto. Lordes &s;ayde the kynge Charlemayne, ye &s;peake wel, but ye mu&s;t take good heede well to all. For there &s;hall be great folke ga|thered of the one parte, &amp; of the other, wherfore I feare me that &s;ome med|lynge &s;hall happe amonge them. For Rohars is full of greate trea&s;on, and all his freendes I know it well. And of the other parte. Reynawde &amp; hys bretherne are ryghte puy&s;&s;aunte and wi&s;e, and thei haue great power with them, and they wyl not &s;ee them&s;elfe wronged, and namely Rycharde the brother of Reinawd, for &amp; if he be ons angrye: he &s;pareth nother kynge nor erle. And therfore I feare him mo&s;t of all the other, for he wolde once haue &s;layne me, I am yet remembred ther|of. Of Reynawde I doubte not for
<PB REF="168"> he is in euery thyng rea&s;onable. Sir &s;aide the duke Naymes be not dy&s;|mayed of nothyng, for we &s;hall keep well youre ryght and your honoure without to doo any wronge to any body. This hanging: the children of Foulques of Moryllon went to the &s;aid y&s;le, where as the king Charle|main had told them that they &s;hould fight. And whan they were pa&s;&s;ed o|uer the riuer in to the y&s;le with their hor&s;es: they bounde theim and than they &s;et theim &s;elfe downe vpon the faire gra&s;&s;e, waytinge after theyr aduer&s;e partie. Now heare what the traitoures had ordeyned, ye ought to wyt that whyle the kynge Charle|maine had &s;poken with his Barons as ye haue heard: Berenger, Ardock and Griffon of haute braunche dyd put them&s;elfe in a bu&s;he, nygh by the &s;aide y&s;le of oure lady, and purpo&s;ed that yf the &s;onnes of Reynawde had the better of the feelde ayen&s;t the two other &s;onnes of Morillon: that than they &s;houlde y&s;&s;ue oute vpon theym, with a right great numbre of folke, for to &s;lea them &s;hamefully.</P>
<P>WHan that Reinawd &s;aw that it was time that hys &s;onnes &s;houlde goe to the y&s;le for to accomply&s;h their battaille: he called Aymonet, &amp; &s;aid to him, com hither faire &s;onne ye be the elde&s;t, and therfore ye ought to be honoured afo|re the yonger brother, holde I gyue you flamberge my good &s;werde, by the whiche ye &s;hall take vengeaunce of the&s;e traytours. For ye been in the righte, and they in the wrong, father &s;aid Aymonet, ye may be in a &s;uretie that ye &s;hal &s;ee this day &s;uche a thing that &s;hal be to youre hertes ioye, for we &s;hall bring the traitours to their &s;hamefull death, &amp; it plea&s;e god. And whan Reinawd heard hys &s;onne &s;o valiauntly &s;peake: he was glad, and ki&s;&s;ed him. And than he gaue hym his benediccion, and in lykewi&s;e to yonnet. And whan he had doon this: he broughte his bretherne &amp; his chil|dren to the y&s;le of our lady. And wha~ they were ouer: he and his bretherne came again towarde the kynge. But as they wolde haue gone: there came a me&s;&s;engat that a&s;cried to Reinaw|de as loude as he might. Reynawde haue mercy on thy children. For yf thou &s;ee not wel to them: they be lo&s;t. wyt that Griffon of haute braunche is embu&s;&s;hed with a greate numbre of folke by the ille for to &s;lea thy chil|dren. And whan Reynawde vnder|&s;toode the&s;e wordes: he blu&s;tred red in his face all for angre, and &s;ayde. Ha &s;weet fraunce, that it is great do|mage that ye may neuer be withoute traytoures. And whan he &s;aid this: he called his brother Richarde, and &s;aid to him. Faire brother goe wyth|out tarying, and arme your &s;elfe, and doo arme al our folke, and than bring theym to the y&s;le and if the fal&s;e trai|toure Griffon of hautbraunche come for to greue my childerne: &s;lea hym incontinence. And whan ye be there: doo that ye maye be &s;een of both par|tyes. And for God keepe well yf the &s;o~nes of Foulques of morillon haue the better: that ye help not in no wi&s;e my childerne, but let theym dye if it come &s;o. For it were greate dy&s;ho|noure for vs: yf ye dyd otherwi&s;e,

And whan Richarde had &s;ayd &s;o: he departed fro his bre|thern, and went and armed hym and all his folke, and then they lyghted on hor&s;ebacke, &amp; went anon there as Reynawd had &s;ayd.

<P>WHan the foure Champions were vpon theyr hor&s;es: thei made none other taryenge: but gaue the &s;purres to theyr hor&s;es, and ran one again&s;t an other and &s;mote eche other in theyr &s;heeldes &s;o &s;ore: y^t the &s;peres flew in peeces without y^t any of them fell on the ground. And wha~ they had broken their &s;peres: thei &s;et hande vnto their &s;werdes. Than Aymonet that helde Flamberge in hys hande &s;ayde vnto Yonnet hys brother. I pray you brother thynke to doo well. For if ye helpe me, they &s;halbe vtterly &s;hamed and di&s;comfi|ted as traytours as they ben. Bro|ther &s;ayd Yonnet doubt not, for I &s;hall neuer fayle you to the death, &amp; al&s;o we ought to recomfort vs. For we ben in the ryght, and they be in y^e wronge. Whan the two brethern had &s;poke ynoughe: they went bothe at ones vpon theyr enemyes, wyth theyr &s;werdes in theyr handes. And than Aymonet ouertooke Con&s;tans with flamberge his &s;werd, and gaue him &s;uche a &s;troke that the &s;werde &s;lyded vpon the vi&s;er, and kut it and his no&s;e a &s;under. And whan Aymo|net &s;awe that the no&s;e of his enemie fall to the erth: he mocked him &amp; &s;aid to him. By god Con&s;tans it is wor|&s;e with you than it was afore, for ye &s;hall neuer ben without a mocke, for that, that this &s;troke hath doone vn+to you, for Flamberge &s;lew your fa|ther, and &s;o &s;hal it doo you &amp; it plea&s;e god. And whan Rohars &s;awe that his brother was &s;o &s;ore wounded: he ranne vpon Yonnet and gaue hym &s;o mighty a &s;troke vpon hys helme: &s;o that yf it had not ben of good fine &s;teele: he had &s;laine hi~ without fayle. This hangyng: Aymonet ranne a|gayne vpon Con&s;tans and gaue hi~ &s;uche a &s;troke vpon hys helme, that he made him for to bowe hys backe vpon the &s;adle, &amp; for the great might of the &s;troke: the hor&s;e mu&s;te for veri need fall down vpon his knees, and &s;mote his mu&s;&s;ell into the erth. And whan that the hor&s;e felt that &s;troke: he ro&s;e lightly vp agayne all afray|ed, and began for to runne thoro|ghe y^e medowes maugre of his mai|&s;ter as mad, nor Con&s;tans had not the myghte for to rule hym: bycau&s;e he was a ma&s;ed and a &s;tonied of that &s;troke, that he had receyued. And than Aymonet and Yonnet wente bothe vpon Rohars, and beganne to fare foule with him, and whan Rohars &s;awe hym&s;elf &s;o &s;harpelye

Co~+&s;tans that ranne throughe the me|dow was comen agayne to him&s;elf and apea&s;ed his hor&s;e a litle heard his brother crye. So came he agayn to hym: and &s;mote Aymonet vpon his helme a great &s;troke, but the hel|me was good, and dommaged hym not. And whan that Con&s;tans &s;awe that he had not &s;layne Aymonet w^t his &s;troke: he wend to haue gone out of his wit, &amp; of y^e other part: he &s;aw the place that was al couered with y^e bloud of his brother, &s;o wy&s;t not co~|&s;tans what to doo.

<P>THys hanging: Yonnet tooke Rohars bi the helme, &amp; wolde haue &s;tra~gled him by fyne force. But whan Con&s;tans &s;aw that: he &s;pur|red hys hor&s;e with the &s;purres, and &s;houed him betwene Rohars &amp; Yon|net, &s;o that it was force to yonnet to let goe hys pri&s;e wolde he or no. And whan Aymonet &s;aw that Con&s;ta~s had deliuered Rohars from the ha~|des of yonnet: he went &amp; ra~ne vpon Con&s;tans and &s;mote him with flam|berge vpon the &s;heelde &s;o harde that he made of it two peeces. Shortlye to &s;peake: the chyldren of Reynawde ha&s;ted &s;o muche the two &s;onnes of Foulques that they began to le&s;e place, &amp; were &s;o werye, that they a&s;|ked none other thyng: but for to re&s;t them&s;elfe.

And whan Con&s;tans had &s;o|iourned a litle: he came vpon Aymo|net and gaue him &s;uche a &s;troke: &s;o that he made him a great wounde, but no dead wounde. And wha~ Ay|monet &s;aw him &s;o wounded: he gaue Con&s;tans &s;o great a &s;troke vpon y^e eare: that he bare it away withal the iawe bone, whan charlemayne &s;aw that great &s;troke: he might not for|beare, but he &s;aid. By god now is he wor&s;e arayed tha~ he was before, for the two &s;onnes of Foulques of mo|rillon be~ &s;hamed and confu&s;ed. Sir &s;ayd Reynawde they haue well de&s;er+ued it, for they haue for&s;worne the~ &s;elfe fal&s;ly. This hanging: Yonnet went vpon Rohars, and gaue him &s;o great a &s;troke vpon hys helme: y^t he brake it, and made his &s;werde to entre in his head a finger deep. Wyt it that the batayle la&s;ted longe the one agayn&s;t the other, and it happed y^t by force of fighting, y^e one again&s;t the other: they were fyghtyng two &amp; two together, wel a bowe &s;hot from eche other, and &s;o made they two batayles, for aymonet fought agai~&s;t Con&s;tans, &amp; yonnet faught agayn&s;t Rohars, which was fore greued, for Yonnet had brought hym to the erth And whan yonnet &s;awe that he had brought downe rohars: he &s;ayd that it were &s;hame to fyght with hym on hor&s;backe agayn&s;t him on foote, &s;o lighted he downe for to fyght wyth Rohars.

But I &s;e well that Yonnet hath brought Ro|hars &s;o lowe that he may no more. whan Rohars &s;aw that he myght no more endure the great &s;trokes of Yonnet: he began to crye and &s;ayde Ha fayre brother Con&s;tans, where are ye y^t ye come not &amp; helpe me y^t are &s;o good a knight, and that toke fir&s;t the quarell in hande, wherof it goeth full euyll with vs. For yf ye &s;uccour me not now: I &s;hall dye incontinent And whan Con&s;tans heard his bro+ther crye thus: he left Aymonet, and went towarde Yonnet, for to helpe hys brother, but wyt it well that he went not very &s;ounde from Aymo|net, for he had made hym moe than xx. woundes. And whan Con&s;tans was come to hys brother: Inconty|nent he ranne vpon Yonnet wyth his hor&s;e. And whan Aymonet &s;aw that: he began to crie after Con&s;ta~s and &s;ayd.

Ye hore&s;ons fal&s;e traytours, ye haue &s;layne y^e good man, &s;ay ye y^e trouth, for if ye deny it: I &s;hal proue it vpon you. And whan y^e labourers heard y^e mai&s;ter ma&s;on &s;peke thus: they bega~ to crye, and &s;ayd. By God may&s;ter, we haue doone it without doubt for enuy that we had at hym. And ther|fore let vs be drowned, ha~ged or dra|wen, or what iu&s;tice ye wyll. For we haue well de&s;erued for to be puny&s;|&s;hed. And whan the archeby&s;&s;hop hearde the traytours &s;peake &s;o: he began for to weepe ful tenderly, and al his colege al&s;o. And the archebi&s;|&s;hop was coun&s;elled that he &s;hould let go the murderers at theyr auen|ture for to do penaunce for theyr &s;in|nes, the whiche thynge the archeby&s;|&s;hop dyd wyth a good wyll. Than was the body of Reynawde brought to lande, and was put vpon a carte for to beare hym to the church, wher as he was had wor&s;hypfully wyth fayre proce&s;&s;ion. And whan y^e corps was in the church: the archeby&s;&s;hop made him redy for to &s;yng the ma&s;&s;e by great deuocion. And whan that y^e &s;eruice was doone: the archeby&s;&s;hop wolde haue gone a proce&s;&s;yon with the corps aboute the churche, &amp; com|maunded foure lordes y^t were there that they &s;hould bere the corps. And than the barons wolde haue doone hys commaundement, but whan they came therto: they coulde not moue the corps by no &s;trength that they could put therto. Sore mer|uayled were the barons, whan they &s;aw that, and &s;ayd vnto eche other. Now may we well knowe that we be not worthy for to touche this ho|ly corps. For we be wicked &s;ynners wherfore let vs go for to &s;hriue vs &amp; put our &s;elfe in good e&s;tate. And while that they &s;pake thus together: the corps ro&s;e vp of hym &s;elfe, and was borne, no man knoweth howe out of the churche into the carte, whi|che anon moued and went his way|es &s;treyght out of the citie, wherof they were al greatly meruayled, and whan the carte was out of Coleyne: he went a pace all the hye waye. And whan the people &s;aw that: they bega~ all to wepe bycau&s;e y^e corps wolde not abyde. Than &s;ayd the archeby&s;|&s;hop vnto them. Syrs now may ye well &s;ee that this is a holy corps by the great myracles that our Lorde &s;heweth by him now, and al this day afore vs all. Wherfore let vs goe af|ter him for to wor&s;hip him. For it
<PB N="clxxii" REF="177"> were not very well doone for to let hym go thus alone. My lorde &s;ayd y^e people, ye &s;ay wel, &amp; than al the cler|gie and al the comyn people litle and great that myght go: folowed y^e cor|ps. And ye ought to wit that in all the citie of Coleyn abode nother ma~ nor woman, but went with y^e corps and all the clergy folowed after &s;in|gyng in great deuocion. So muche went the carte that he came to a ly|tle towne that is called Croyne, and there he abode &s;tyll. And ye mu&s;t wit that our lorde dyd &s;hew there many fayre myracles for the loue of the ho|ly body, for al &s;ycke people of what &s;yckenes it was that came there for to wor&s;hyp the holye bodye: Were whole incontinent. This happed of the noble knight Reynawde of mou~+tawban, as ye haue hearde. And ye ought to wyt that the renome of the holy body was &s;o &s;pred all aboute, that folke came to Croyne where it abode from ferre wayes for to &s;eeke hym, and he made there &s;o fayre my|racles: that of all the Realme and of almayne folke drewe thether. And &s;o muche were worthe the offringes that were done there within a &s;hort while: that of a litle chapell there as the bodye re&s;ted, whiche was of our lady, is now a royall churche and a great. And whan the holy body was abyden in this lytle chapell as it is &s;ayd, where god made contynually miracles: the archeby&s;&s;hop of Co|leyn &amp; al the clergi came to the corps &amp; vncouered his vi&s;age that euerye body &s;hould &s;ee him y^t came there, yf haply y^e ony man or woman myght know hym for to haue his name, for none coulde name hym, but the holy corps. But there came no man that could know. And whan the archebi&s;+&s;hop &s;aw y^t no body could &s;ay what he was: he was &s;ory for it, for yf he had knowen his name: he wold haue put him in a &s;hrine of golde, bicau&s;e of the great miracles that he made dayly, for he made the defe to heare, y^e blynde to &s;ee, the lame to go &amp; ryght many that were dombe he made to &s;peake, &amp; often times apered tapres of wexe brennyng aboute the corps.</P>
<P>NOw &s;hall ye heare howe the noble Reynawde was kno|wen. Yee ought to wyt that the bre|thern of Reynawde, that is to wyt Alarde, Guicharde &amp; Richarde were on a daye vpon mountayne &s;o &s;orye that they could heare no tidinges of theyr brother Reynawde. Than cam a Pylgrime forth by that &s;alued the barons. Pylgrime &s;ayde Alarde, fro whe~s come ye? yf ye wot any tydin|ges tel it vs I pray you. Lordes &s;aid the pilgrime w^t a good wyll I &s;hall tell you that I know. Wyt it that I come out of Almaine, from a towne that is called Croyne by Coleyne v|pon the ryne, where I haue &s;een ma|ny great miracles doone of god, for the loue of a man that came to the Citie but late ago, the which was &s;o great that euery body &s;aid there that he was a Giaunte. And wyt ye that whan he came there: y^t he &s;awe men make the churche of &s;aynt Peter, &s;o dyd he pre&s;ent there hys &s;eruyce to the may&s;ter ma&s;on, the whiche retey+ned
<PB REF="178"> hym gladly. Shortly for to &s;ay: this great man dyd wonder of bea|ryng of &s;tones and of morter. For he bare more at ones: than .xv. other of the labourers that were there with him, and he was all day w^tout meate &s;aue at euyn: he tooke a peny that he gate, for no more he wolde haue for hys laboure a day, and therwyth he bought hym a peny lo&s;e, and dranke none other to it, but water, and tha~ he went to his re&s;t vpon a litle &s;traw vnder a great vaute. And ye mu&s;te wyt, that this great man was well loued of the may&s;ters ma&s;ons of the &s;ayd churche, whyche wolde often haue gyuen him meate and wyne, &amp; more money. But he wolde neuer take nothyng but a peny onely by y^e day, for to bye hym &s;elfe a peny lofe as I told you afore. He &s;erued &s;o wel all the ma&s;ons there that they were more contente of hym alone: then of the other labourers. And whan the labourers &s;aw that they were &s;o ly|tle &s;et by for y^e loue of this great ma~: they were &s;ore an angred, and tooke great enuy at hym and con&s;pired to|g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ther for to &s;lea hym &s;hamefully.</P>
<P>So dyd they a&s;pye hym where as he &s;lept vnder the vaute, whyle that y^e may&s;ter ma&s;ons were gone to theyr dyner: and then one of theym came to hym with great hamer in his ha~d and brayned him, then they put hym in a &s;acke and caryed him in a carte to the Ryuer of the Ryne, where they ca&s;t hym. And wyt it that wha~ they had doone &s;o: our lorde &s;hewed there a great myracle. For al the fi&s;|&s;hes of the Ryne a&s;&s;embled them a|boute the corps, and made it abyde in one place aboue the water. And whan that the nyght was come: aun|gelles were hearde there, whyche &s;onge melodiou&s;ly the &s;eruyce of the dead &s;o hye: that all they of the Citie might haue heard them, and it &s;emed that al y^e water about hym had ben in a fyre of the greate lyght that was &s;een there. Than came the archebi&s;|&s;hop of Coleyne wyth all his colege and made the corps to be taken and brought in a Carte to the Churche. And whan he was there: the Arche|by&s;&s;hop &s;onge ma&s;&s;e, for this was in the mornyng, and whan that the &s;eruyce was doone: the Acheby&s;&s;hop &s;ayd to foure Lordes whyche were there, that they &s;hould take vp the corps for to haue him into his graue wyth fayre pro&s;e&s;&s;yon. But the&s;e foure barons coulde neuer moue hi~ from y^e place where as he was. But the corps incontynent to euery bo|dies &s;ight, that was there, was brou+ght into the carte agayne, wyth the twynkelyng of an eye, and &s;odeynly the carte departed, and wente away alone out of the towne, as good a pace as thoughe ten hor&s;es had dra|wen at it, whyche was &s;ore agayn&s;t the wyll of the people that wept ful tenderly, bycau&s;e that it wolde not a byde with them. But all they of the Cytye, bothe lytle and great went a proce&s;&s;yon after it, vnto a lytle town where the corps of the great man a|bode &s;tyll whyche is called Croyne in a lytle chapell of our lady, where he doth now many a fayre myracle, for I en&s;ure you y^t al the &s;icke folkes
<PB N="clxxii" REF="178"> y^t &s;eeke him there be made whole, &amp; returne to their home in good helth. And &s;o I haue left there the archebi&s;+&s;hop of Coleyne, and all the clergye that hath doo make of y^e offerynges that ben gyuen there vnto thys holy corps a fayre place and a roial chur|che, there as the &s;ayd chapell of oure lady was afore.</P>
<P>WHan Alarde, Guicharde and Rycharde, heard the pilgry|me &s;peake &s;o: they began all three to weepe ful &s;ore for pitie that they had of theyr brother reynawde, for well they knew, it was he of whome the Pylgryme &s;pake of. Alas my bre|thern &s;ayd Rycharde. Now ben w^t well de&s;troyed, and vndoone for euer more. For I know wel that it is out deere brother that we haue &s;ought &s;o longe. Wyt it y^t the three brethern made there &s;o great &s;orowe, that it cannot be reher&s;ed. And whan they had made this greate &s;orowe: they tooke leaue of the pilgrime and tha~|ked hym, and went to make them re|dy, &amp; than tooke theyr waye toward Croyne, by Coleyne vpon the Ryne. And they dyd &s;o muche by theyr iour+neys: that they came vnto Croyne.</P>
<P>And lyghted before the churche they and theyr folke, where they found &s;o great flowyng and gatheryng of the people and &s;o great pre&s;e of folke: y^t wyth great payne they myght entre wythin the Churche. And whan the knyghtes were within: they wente nyghe the holye corps that was v|pon a fayre bere all vncouered, and &s;aw &s;o great lyght aboute the corps as there had ben an hundred torches Than wente they as nyghe hym as they coulde for to looke hym in the face and anon thei knew that he was theyr brother, &amp; with that they loked vpon hym: they fell downe in a &s;wo|une to the erth. And whan the arche+by&s;&s;hop &s;aw that: he was &s;ore aba&s;|&s;hed and &s;ayd to &s;ome of his Colege. Syrs I beleue that wee &s;hall &s;oone know that we haue de&s;yred &s;o long. For I wene that the&s;e lordes knowe wel this holy corps. This hanging: were the three brethern come~ agayn to them&s;elfe, and began to crye and fare as they had ben mad, than &s;ayd Alarde al weepynge in thys maner, Alas what &s;hall we nowe caytyfes knyghtes doo, poore of honour and of al wele, &s;yth that we haue lo&s;t our brother by whome we were &s;o &s;ore doubted and dred? Alas deere brother who was &s;o hardy to laye hande on you? I beleue that he knew not your debonayrtie &amp; kindnes, for he wolde not haue &s;layne you &s;o crueltye. And than he turned hym towarde hys two brethern and &s;ayd. My fayre bre+thern we ought wel to be &s;ory, &s;yth y^t we haue lo&s;t our brother Reinawde that was all our hope our tru&s;t and comfort. Alas &s;ayde Rycharde, bro|ther Reinawde whi had ye euer that courage for to habandone vs as ye did: &s;eyng that ye loued vs &s;o mu|che? Alas ye &s;tale awaye your&s;elf by night, for to come amonge y^e handes of the murderers, that haue &s;layne you &s;o cruelly. Alas they wy&s;t not y^e great domage that is of your death.
<PB REF="179"> whan the three brethern had wepte ynoughe in great &s;obbynges and la|mentacions, for y^e loue of theyr deere brother Reynawde: they went &amp; ki&s;|&s;ed the corps on the mouth, the one after the other, and with this thei fel downe agayne in &s;woune. And wha~ they were come agayn to them&s;elfe: Rycharde began to crye and &s;aye. A|las fayre brethern, now ben we lo&s;te for euer. For we &s;hall no more be &s;et by, nother doubted, nor dred more than children, wherefore I &s;ay that we &s;hould &s;lea our &s;elfe, to the ende that we may be with you, for we ou|ght not to liue after your death. Wit it y^t who had be there he &s;hould haue had an harde hert but he &s;hould haue wept for to &s;ee y^e three brethern make theyr mone.</P>
<P>WHan the archebi&s;hop and y^e Burgeys that were there &s;aw the great &s;orowe that the three knightes made: the good Archeby&s;|&s;hop came to them and &s;ayd, Lordes be ye not dy&s;plea&s;ed of that I &s;hall &s;ay to you. Syrs to my &s;emynge, ye doo not wel for to make &s;o great &s;o|row nor to di&s;comfort your &s;elfe &s;o muche as ye do, but rather ye &s;hould make great ioy, and be glad for your brother that is a &s;aynt in heuen, the whyche had &s;uffred martyrdom in y^e &s;eruice of our lorde, wherof ye may &s;ee that he rewardeth him wel for it. For ye &s;ee now before your eyen the great miracles y^t he dooth, wherfore I pray you that ye wyll recomforte your &s;elfe. And tell vs yf it plea&s;e you what ye ben, and howe is thys holy body named, and what hys na|me was wha~ he liued in this worlde to the ende that his name be wryten aboute his tombe? And whan his bre+thern heard the archeby&s;&s;hop &s;peake thus: they began a lytle to leue theyr &s;orow. And than Alarde that was thelde&s;t after Reynawde &s;ayd to him Lorde &s;ythe it plea&s;e you to knowe what we be and howe this corps is called: I &s;hall tel it you w^tout faute. Ye mu&s;te wyt that this corps was called (whan he was amonge vs ali|ue) Reynawde of Mountawban the ryght worthy knyght, and we three that ben heere are his brethern, and wel I wot that ye haue heard &s;peake of the foure &s;onnes of Aymon, the whiche Charlemayne the great king of Fraunce warred &s;o longe. Than whan the archeby&s;&s;hop and the peo|ple hearde that they were the foure &s;onnes of Aymon, of the whyche all the worlde &s;pake, and that the holy corps was the goood Reynawde of Mountawba~ the noble and valiant knight: they began all to weepe for pitie and for ioye, bycau&s;e they &s;awe al before them the mo&s;te noble &amp; wor+thie&s;t knyght of the worlde, that in his lyfe was more to drede than any man alyue, that was dead in the &s;er+uy&s;e of our lorde, doinge penaunce. After that the&s;e three bretherne had thus left a lytle theyr &s;orowe: they made theyr brother to be layde in his tombe, that was right riche, that the archebi&s;&s;hop had doone make where the holy corps re&s;teth yet at this day as euydently is knowen, and he is called &s;aynt Reynawde the martyr.
<PB N="Clxxiiii" REF="179"> The memory of him was that time put in wrytyng auctentykly, &amp; eueri yere is there kept for him great &s;ole~p+nitie and fea&s;t. And after the &s;epul|turyng of the holye corps: the bre|thern went agayne into theyr owne Countrie.</P>
<TRAILER>MY fayre lordes who that this pre&s;ent booke &s;hall rede or heare, we &s;hall pray our lorde god &amp; the gloryous Saynt Reynawde the marter, that he giue vs grace to per|&s;euer, and continue our lyfe in good workes, by the whiche we may haue at our endyng the life that euer &s;hal la&s;t.
