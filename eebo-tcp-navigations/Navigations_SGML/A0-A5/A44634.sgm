<HEAD>To my Honored Friend <HI>E. H.</HI> E&s;q;</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an age, when books had better be burnt for Hereticks, than pre|&s;ume to appear with|out the dull formality of an Epi&s;tle; &s;uch a notable de|fect would pre&s;ent them in as rediculous a <HI>Querpo,</HI> as a Courtier without the pro|perty of his Sword, though to both equally u&s;ele&s;s; therefore, lea&s;t I &s;hould be taxed with too much ignor|ance
<PB REF="3"> or pre&s;umption, to you who are our petty Heroes particular friend, and the depo&s;itary of his greate&s;t &s;e|crets. To you, who have been an eye witne&s;s of &s;ome of the mo&s;t remark|able inconveniences that his natural curio&s;ity, re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition, Amours, Incli|nation, and fiery nature have plung'd him in: finally to you, that by con&s;equence can be&s;t di&s;cerne what fruits are of his own growth, from what he may have borrow|ed from his neighbours Or|chards, I dedicate the&s;e fol|lowing &s;heets. I am &s;en&s;ible
<PB REF="3"> that now I &s;hould proceed to the &s;etting forth of your prai&s;es, and humbly &s;uppli|cate for your generous pro|tection, but really I am &s;o lit|tle accu&s;tom'd to the flatter|ing &s;tile of a Dedication, that I know not what more to &s;ay, therefore would glad|ly take the opportunity to end with the general con|clu&s;ion of, Sir, your mo&s;t humble &s;ervant, <HI>B.</HI></P>
<P>But then, what would the Book&s;eller &s;ay? who yet does expect &s;o much &s;cribbling as mu&s;t fill up &s;ome empty pages of the la&s;t &s;heet? why Faith to
<PB REF="4"> plea&s;e all parties (if it be po&s;&s;ible) <HI>I</HI> will make bold to lay you a&s;ide, and &s;peak a word or two to the Cur|teous Reader, and that I hope will do the jobb.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, <HI>I</HI> will let him know, that he will find here &s;uch varieties of humours, as, I hope, will plea&s;e him, provided he adds not a number among&s;t the peripatetick Cinicks. To &s;uch I mu&s;t confe&s;s the&s;e things would prove eye&s;ores, at lea&s;t if not a <HI>Scanda|lum Magnatum,</HI> but to the Gay, Ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and witty &s;ort this may be u&s;eful while
<PB REF="4"> they leave the knoty points of the more moro&s;e part of learning to be cleav'd in &s;un|der with the Beetles of the &s;owr Philo&s;ophers under|&s;tanding.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t part you will meet with &s;uch accidents as wild young Travellers are apt to fall into, and if you plea&s;e, you may make good u&s;e of them; In the &s;econd you will be diverted with the extravagant conceits of a <HI>Ro&s;ycrucians</HI> chymereal Philo&s;ophy, and &s;ublime learning in the ob&s;truce Sciences. In the third your imagination will be tickled
<PB REF="5"> (e&s;pecially if ever you have put your no&s;e in a chymical Author) with &s;ome quaint expo&s;itions of the mo&s;t di&s;|ficult points, on all things &s;uch as the envious malice or con|ceited ignorance of &s;ome Writers have left to po&s;teri|ty, wrapp'd up in tho&s;e mi|&s;terious riddles, that mo&s;t wonderfully do puzle this age, and will fit the next for New <HI>Bedlame.</HI> But <HI>I</HI> advi&s;e you not to pin your Faith on all I &s;ay, for it may not in every point prove to be Madam truth in its <HI>puris naturalibus.</HI> And why you &s;hould expect to find more
<PB REF="5"> reality in a Romantick &s;tory then in the Alchymi&s;ts re|ligiou&s;ly grave Vollumes, <HI>I</HI> know not, except, <HI>Ridendo dicere verum,</HI> come in your mind, and delude you into the fooles Paradice. Well take your chance friend, while I inform you, that in the fourth part you will meet with the fruits and re&s;ults of ra&s;h youth, when once it makes its own &s;word a Law, and every indifferent object the &s;ub|ject of his affections.</P>
<P>Now Curteous Reader, but that I think you wi&s;er than my &s;elf, I would ad|vi&s;e
<PB REF="6"> you to follow what is good in the whole, (If you can find any) and &s;o to take warning by others harms, as to go to bed in a whole skin, and the next morn|ing &s;ing to the tune of &s;ome new Ballad.</P>

<HEAD>THE English Mon&s;ieur <HI>A Comical Novel.</HI> The Fir&s;t Part.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Chief City of <HI>England</HI> there dwelt a married Cou|ple, who, though they had nor &s;uch Fortune as to rai&s;e them to the fir&s;t Rank. They enjoy'd a &s;ufficient E&s;tate to maintain them&s;elves in a hand&s;ome mediocrity above the Vulgar.</P>
<P>One only Child had been the re|&s;ult of their twenty years Love, on whom they had be&s;towed an Educa|tion rather beyond their Rank then &s;utable to it. <HI>Noble</HI> was his Name,
<PB N="2" REF="8"> he had not attained to his Nine|teenth year, when his Parents were forced to part with their onely Joy, and all their hopes, by &s;ending him beyond Sea, thereby to reclaim and wean him from &s;ome company very unfitting his Age and condition, with whom he had unhappily acquainted him&s;elf, but all other means having been endeavour'd in vain, there was none left but that, which had &s;o well &s;ucceeded to the Father, when about his Sons years, that they hop|ed for the &s;ame good &s;ucce&s;s towards the Son.</P>
<P><HI>Noble</HI> was of an indifferent &s;ize, &s;mall timber'd not very &s;trong, con|&s;equently quick, active, of &s;anguine fair complexion, and of a Re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition; he had an inclination to travel, and being of a quick appre|hen&s;ion, and agreeable conver&s;ation, it rendred him acceptable to all com|panies of either Sex, e&s;pecially a|mong&s;t the Female, his natural con|&s;titution inclining him to <HI>Venus</HI> her wor&s;hip, to the neglect of <HI>Bacchus</HI> his &s;ervice.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="8">
<P>He had gone through the Rudi|ments of the Latine Tongue, attain|ed to a perfection in the French, and received &s;ome in&s;tructions from Eminent Ma&s;ters in Mu&s;ick, the Ma|thematicks, Drawing, Fencing and &s;uch like gentile Exerci&s;es, when he forced his Parents to this Re&s;olution, &s;o contrary to their de&s;igns, and &s;o a|greeable to his own Genius.</P>
<P>Our young Traveller, was fitted with all things nece&s;&s;ary for his Voy|age, and an a&s;&s;urance of a Compe|tent yearly allowance, &s;o long as they &s;hould hear of his civil Conver&s;ation, and the following of his exerci&s;es: The day of his departure, Letters of Recommendations were given him to divers per&s;ons of Note and Re|pute in <HI>Paris,</HI> with a Bill of Ex|change for a &s;upply of monies, to &s;et him in the French mode &s;o &s;oon as arrived. The tender Mother's tear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, with her private Golden ble&s;&s;ing ended the Adieus. The next morn|ing, very early, up gets our Stripling, and directs his cour&s;e towards <HI>Dover,</HI> where he met with a favourable pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="4" REF="9"> to <HI>Calis,</HI> there having joyn'd him|&s;elf to the company of the Stage Coach (though on a &s;tout Gelding) they &s;et forward for <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t day of their journey the Coach found it very difficult to pa&s;s o|ver a certain &s;mall brook, which was overflown by a &s;udden fall of Rain, which made the Company re&s;olve to take up in &s;ome place on this &s;ide <HI>Paris,</HI> rather than hazard the pa&s;&s;age. They therefore de&s;ired our young Gal|lant to ride before to a certain Vil|lage, which they pointed at, and be|&s;peak a good Supper for the whole Company. <HI>Le Noble</HI> glad of any op|portunity to oblige his fellow Travel|lers, gives no An&s;wer, but flacking the Reins of his Bridle, made with a good &s;peed towards the place, lights at an Inn, where having taken care of his Bea&s;t, he be&s;peaks a hand&s;ome Sup|per for &s;even or eight per&s;ons, which would a&s;&s;uredly be there within an hour at &s;urthe&s;t. In an in&s;tant mine Ho&s;t gives out the Orders unto all the Officers under him, and they Execute them with dilligence eve|ry
<PB N="5" REF="9"> one according to his Station.</P>
<P><HI>Noble,</HI> mean time having e&s;py'd a young Maid, who was preparing of Candlos to light this new come Gue&s;t to his Chamber, and perceiving that &s;he had a certain Ayr and Meen, which was more plea&s;ing than in &s;uch ordinary per&s;ons is commonly found, began a di&s;cour&s;e, whereby to try, whether her Wit was an&s;werable to her pritty out&s;ide. He had but ju&s;t found out by her quick, yet mode&s;t reparties, that &s;he was &s;omething more than a Inn-Keepers Chamber|maid, when &s;he was call'd to her bu|&s;ine&s;s, which broke off the di&s;cour&s;e, but it had been &s;oon renewed again by our young Traveller, who would have found out &s;ome opportunity to have acco&s;ted her again, had not two Mendicant Friers diverted him from it by demanding his Charity, in a pritty kind of obliging Dialect: He having formerly heard that &s;uch per|&s;ons are very plea&s;ing and agrocable Company, did de&s;ign to divert him|&s;elf with the&s;e two good Brothers till Supper time; and leave his other
<PB N="6" REF="10"> Game till after Supper; with that he falls in di&s;cour&s;e with them, and de&s;ires their Company till Supper time, that then they &s;hould not on|ly have their &s;hare of it, but carry the re&s;idue along with them. For, good Reader, you are to know, that tho&s;e kind of Mendicants never car|ry money about them, it being con|trary to the Rules of their Order to ask for, or receive any. The good Friers accepted <HI>Le Nobles</HI> kind offer, and after a Gla&s;s or two of Wine, began to be in their u&s;ual witty and mode&s;t Mirth; and then came out a multitude of very plea&s;ant Stories: of which tho&s;e per&s;ons are alwaies as well provided, as are our Coun|try Fidlers with Songs, &s;utable to all humours and Companies, though ever accompanied with more mode&s;ty. This made the time pa&s;s merrily a|way, and the Coach not &s;eem &s;o long in coming, though it had pa&s;s'd it's hour. While they were all on their jokes, in comes mine Ho&s;t fuming and puffing, &s;wearing by all the fiery Gods, that the meat was almo&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="10"> &s;poil'd, and yet no News of the Com|pany, while the Ho&s;t was thus venting that heat, which he had contracted at the fire, in comes a Me&s;&s;enger, with notice, that the Coach, having found out a by way was gone directly to <HI>Pa|ris;</HI> the&s;e news one would think, &s;hould have &s;truck our Traveller in|to a con&s;ternation, but nothing le&s;s appear'd in his looks; on the contra|ry, having bid the Ho&s;t to &s;erve up Supper, he told the Friers that he was glad to have met with their good Company, which with that of his Ho&s;t, would be &s;ufficient to divert him from Reflecting on this cro&s;s ad|venture, which concern'd him no fur|ther, than the not meeting with &s;ome friends, that would expect him that night at <HI>Paris.</HI> But it matters not, continued he, I &s;hall be there early in the morning, mean time Gentle|men, the &s;atisfaction I receive by your good Company, makes a &s;uffi|cient return for my &s;tay here this night; this Complement ended, while the good Friers were making &s;ome excu&s;es, up come the fore-runners of
<PB N="8" REF="11"> the Fea&s;t, and according to the French dilligence, in a moment the Cloth was laid, the Di&s;hes placed in order, the Wine &s;et in Tubs of water to Cool, the Gla&s;&s;es wa&s;h'd, and in a word all in a decent readine&s;s, no|thing wanting to begin the on&s;et, but the word of Command, which is u&s;ually expre&s;s'd by a Benedicite. The Company had not been long &s;et but news was brought up to the Ho&s;t, that the Curate was below that would &s;peak with him, at which the Ho&s;t &s;aid, Sirs, this Curate of our Pari&s;h here, is the be&s;t Company of the World, he is for all humours and con&s;titutions, will you be merry, no man hath better Stories, will you be &s;erious, he is a Saint, would you play, he knows all Games and tricks, would you drink, that is his Ele|ment. In &s;hort, Sir, he is for what any Company plea&s;es, and I a&s;&s;ure you, you will receive a &s;ingular &s;a|tisfaction in his Company if you p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;e to admit him into yours. <HI>Le Noble</HI> needed no further inducement, he quickly gave order that he &s;hould be
<PB N="9" REF="11"> brought up: the Curate was no &s;ooner enter'd the Chamber, but he &s;ets him&s;elf down, and having &s;aid, Gentlemen, you may think &s;trange at my abrupt intru&s;ion into your Company, without the lea&s;t Complement, but you mu&s;t know, that be&s;ides my natural anti|pathy towards them, I find, that in the po&s;ture you all are, I &s;hould pre|judice my &s;elf very much in delaying to carry on the work of the day, e&s;peci|ally it being &s;o near a conclu&s;ion, with that he fell on, every fift or &s;ixt bit cal|ling for Wine, which he would take mo&s;t di&s;dainfully from the Waiter, if no brimmer, and &s;poke not a word more till the Cloath was taken away. Du|ring the Supper, the two good Friers re|lated divers pritty plea&s;ant Stories and all freely took their Cups. After Supper the Curate did highly recom|pence his long &s;ilence, there was no talk but for him, which he made up &s;o plea&s;antly with Songs and Ralle|ries, that no time could be more plea&s;ingly &s;pent. Among&s;t the re&s;t of his Stories, I &s;hall give you here an account of his la&s;t, which he U&s;her'd
<PB N="10" REF="12"> in with this preamble to the two good Friers (who were then filling their Bugdets with the re&s;idue of the Meat according to <HI>Le Noble</HI>'s order.) Brothers, &s;aid he, I &s;ee you are now providing for your March, and I think it is high time, lea&s;t you find the Gates of your Covent &s;hut again&s;t you, and &s;o be obliged, not much a|gain&s;t your wills, to take up your nights Lodgings at &s;ome good neigh|bouring hou&s;e, to the good mans di|&s;turbance, though peradventure with the good liking of the Wife, her Daughter, Maid, or all three, rather than di&s;oblige any of them. But before you go, pray give me leave to relate what a pritty kind of Confe&s;&s;i|on, one of your Order required from a pritty young, but very &s;illy woman. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, (an&s;wer'd one of the good Friers) that we were wondring that you had &s;pared us &s;o long, contrary to your u&s;ual Cu&s;tome, but do your wor&s;t, we will give you a <HI>Rowland</HI> for your <HI>Oliver,</HI> and begin when you plea&s;e.

<HEAD>The Curate<HI>'s</HI> Tale.</HEAD>
<P>A Certain Good man, who had lately married a young Wo|man, again&s;t a good time was telling his Wife, that he de&s;ign'd to go to Confe&s;&s;ion, and that he would have her to do the like, &s;he excus'd her &s;elf by informing her Husband, that &s;he having never yet been at Confe&s;&s;ion, did not know the manner of it, nor knew &s;he to whom &s;he &s;hould addre&s;s her &s;elf, &s;weetheart, &s;aid the good man to his Wife, in the Mona&s;tery of the <HI>Car|melites,</HI> there is a certain Religious man of my acquaintance, to whom I will recommend you, for my &s;ake he will in&s;truct you, and will &s;hrive you very well, &s;o giving his Wife the name of the Frier, he &s;ends her to the Covent. The good woman got thither inquires after the Frier, and &s;he is ordered to wait for him in the Church; not long after comes unto her the party, who inquires what &s;he de&s;ired; to which with a Curte&s;ie, &s;he made An|&s;wer, that her Husband, &s;uch a one
<PB N="12" REF="13"> had &s;ent her to him to confe&s;&s;ion, knowing that he was a godly man, and &s;he young and unexperienc'd in &s;uch matters. At this the Frier pricks up his ears, and within his heart thanks his good fate, for pre&s;enting him with &s;o good a Fortune, with that he takes her to an ob&s;cure place of the Church, where he us'd to confe&s;s others, and there, he holding her by the hand, began his Interrogations, and through his diligent Care and good In&s;tructions, he made the Innocent Creature an&s;wer very directly unto all his que&s;tions. The Frier by this time having found by the &s;illine&s;s of her own An&s;wers, that &s;he was much Fairer than Wife, he re&s;olv'd to bear up clo&s;e to her, continuing his di&s;|cour&s;e in this manner. My dear Child, hitherto you have an&s;wer'd very punctually to all my que&s;tions, and accordingly I &s;hall ab&s;olve you, but there is yet remaining one thing in which you mu&s;t be very ju&s;t, or you will commit a very great Sacriledge. Therefore be &s;ure to give me a very exact account of what I am going to
<PB N="13" REF="13"> ask of you. The poor &s;illy Creature having made an&s;wer with a yea, Sir, and a &s;hort Curte&s;ie, he drawing her &s;till more in the dark, &s;o that they could be perceived! It is my kindne&s;s to you, &s;aid he, which makes me lead you &s;o in the dark, that you may with more freedom an&s;wer to what I &s;hall ask you, and with that holding her by the hand with one hand, and under the Chin with the other, dear Child, continued he, how often has your Husband lain with you? Be &s;ure you An&s;wer me ju&s;tly, and hid nothing from me? At thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;illy young thing, an&s;wer'd with a great &s;igh, truly &s;o often with|in the compa&s;s of the half year they had been married, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for her to know the number. At this An&s;wer, the Frier &s;eeming much &s;urpriz'd, how &s;aid he, not know the number, how can the Church have the Tithe then? And how can you hope for an ab&s;olution &s;o long as you withold the Church of its rights; I am very &s;orry, continued he, that you are in &s;o dangerous a condition, and for the Love I bear you, and by rea&s;on
<PB N="14" REF="14"> of your want of knowledge in &s;uch matters, I would gladly find out &s;ome way to redre&s;s this great error, thus went the Frier on &s;till aggravating each Circum&s;tance, which &s;o affright|ed the poor &s;illy woman, that &s;he fell trembling upon her knees at the Fri|ers feet, and all in Tears and Sobs earne&s;tly begg'd, that he would con|trive &s;ome way to ab&s;olve her from this &s;o hainous a &s;in, &s;eeing that &s;he had committed it out of meer ignorance, and that her Husband was very much to blame, that he had not given her timely notice of it; and humbly intreated him to take the Tithes him&s;elf, as much as he thought fit, and rather more than le&s;s, that &s;he might be ab&s;olutely freed and ab&s;olved from that grievous &s;in. The good Frier did what he could to appea&s;e her, and having &s;etled her mind a little by his comfortable &s;ay|ings, he told her, that for the pre|&s;ent, he would be contented with &s;ome &s;mall part of the Tithes, but that he would take a longer time to com|pute what was due in all, for as he
<PB N="15" REF="14"> would not have the Church to lo&s;e any advantage, neither would he for the World wrong her good Husband of the worth of a pin, with that he takes her by the Arm and conveys her by a &s;ecret pa&s;&s;age into his Chamber, where he took what part of the Tithe he pleas'd, which having done and ki&s;&s;ing the young Woman, go, my Child, &s;aid he, and be chearful, I &s;hall come &s;ometimes at your hou&s;e, to take the re&s;t of the Tithes, but one thing more I mu&s;t inform you of before you go, know that is a mortal &s;in for any one to reveal any the lea&s;t part of Confe&s;&s;ion, therefore you mu&s;t be &s;ure not to declare, by any means &s;oever, either to your Husband or any body e&s;le, what has pa&s;s'd between you and me, for if you do, you will be damn'd for ever without redemption. To which the Penitent woman having an&s;wer'd, that &s;he would be &s;ure to keep &s;ilence, and de&s;iring him once more to take a larger quantity of the remaining Tithes, lea&s;t any evil &s;hould happen to her or her Husband, by detaining them any longer, he to

<P>His fir&s;t dayes journy had nothing in it remarkable, but the next will afford us &s;omething worth taking notice of: it happened that in the evening, he took up his lodgings at an Inn, were three or four Coaches meeting that very day, the hou&s;e was extream full, and he coming late, and every body having &s;upped, he was fore'd to be&s;peak a Supper for him|&s;elf: mean time, while his Supper was getting ready &s;eeing among&s;t the re&s;t
<PB N="58" REF="36"> of the&s;e Companies that were not yet retired into their Chambers, a pritty brisk young Woman that was very frolick, he acco&s;ts her, and falls in|to di&s;cour&s;e with her, he found her of a very fine humour and plea&s;ant conver&s;e which had made him pa&s;s an hours time very agreeable, had it not been interrupted &s;ometime by an impor|tant Husbands calls; which having not been regarded, though often re|peated, the Husband came down &s;ome &s;teps, and told his Wife, that if &s;he did not come pre&s;ently, he would come and fetch her; &s;he regarding it not did continue her di&s;cour&s;e with <HI>Le Noble,</HI> &s;eeming as well plea&s;ed with his good Company and gay&s;ome hu|mour as he was with hers.</P>
<P>This &s;et the goodman in &s;uch a fury, that he came ha&s;tily down in his night Cap and flippers, and taking his Wife by the Arm, he pull'd her off from her &s;eat giving her &s;uch a &s;wing as had like to have fling her on the flour, &s;aying, is this a time o'th'night to be tattling with a young&s;ter, &s;o that, you cannot li&s;ten to your Hus|band,
<PB N="59" REF="36"> when he calls you? get you up to your Chamber, or I'le &s;end you up with a witne&s;s, &s;he recovering her &s;elf, told him, that &s;he knew her own time without his advice, that if he had &s;uch mind to his bed, he might go if he pleas'd, for her part &s;he had not, and that &s;he would &s;tay till &s;he had a mind to it. Mean time it is very &s;trange, continued &s;he, that you can|not forbear &s;hewing your bruti&s;h hu|mour in publick, e&s;pecially in pre&s;ence of a Gentleman &s;o civil, and of &s;o plea&s;ing a conver&s;ation; upon this the Husband going to take her again, by the Arm, <HI>Le Noble</HI> offer'd to enter|po&s;e in a civil manner, de&s;iring the Husband to forbear all har&s;h u&s;age to|wards a per&s;on, who doubtle&s;s, had no further intentions then to pa&s;s an hour or two in a chearful conver&s;a|tion. At which the angry Husband, did &s;nappi&s;hly an&s;wer, who are you, pray? That thus undertake to teach me? When I want a Ma&s;ter, I &s;hall &s;end for you, mean time meddle with own bu&s;ine&s;s. Go and get you a beard before you undertake
<PB N="60" REF="37"> to in&s;truct a man of my years. Here his Wife interrupted him, intreating <HI>Le Noble</HI> to take no further notice of his impertinance, a&s;&s;uring him that if it were not that &s;he would detain him no longer from his Supper, &s;he would in &s;pight of her Husbands ill humour, &s;tay as long as &s;he pleas'd; but that &s;he did hope to recompence this lo&s;t time the next day, if it was her good fortune to travel the &s;ame way. With that &s;he made him a Curte&s;ie and retired, follow'd by her angry Husband, who did re&s;olve to break their mea&s;ures, telling them, that they did reckon without their Ho&s;t, and that he would prevent their coming together again.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble</HI> could not forbear laughing at this Jealous man's actions, though vex'd that he had &s;o &s;oon lo&s;t his pretty companion. Supper being ready he fell to it, with a re&s;olution to have another bout with his Gentlewoman the next morning. Having &s;upp'd he ask'd for a Chamber it was an&s;wer'd, that he might have one if he pleas'd, but that there was ne're a bed empty, the hou&s;e being &s;o full, that every bed had two in it,
<PB N="61" REF="37"> except one Gentleman, that lay &s;ingle, that if he pleas'd to accept of part of his bed, they would go de&s;ire the Gentleman to &s;pare it him. It be|ing late there was no remedy, &s;o that <HI>Le Noble</HI> was forced to go to bed to that Gentleman, who did very civily receive him.</P>
<P>In the dead of the night there was a great out cry heard of fire, which made all the people of the hou&s;e to ri&s;e to know what was the matter. <HI>Le Noble</HI> and his bed fellow among&s;t the re&s;t, &s;o did the trouble&s;ome Hu&s;|band, who lay in the next Room to them. The inquiry made, it was found to be &s;ome &s;mall harm, that an ill extinct Candle had done, which being perceiv'd by a per&s;on between &s;leep and awake, which made him apprehend it to be wor&s;e than it was, had cryed out fire; but that all was well again. This made every one to retire to bed again in the dark, as they had got out of them.</P>
<P><HI>Le Noble,</HI> not long after he was in bed, heard his bed fellow &s;igh and &s;ay, &s;ure never poor woman was trou|bled
<PB N="62" REF="38"> with &s;uch a Husband as I am, at this <HI>Le Noble,</HI> con&s;idering where he was, did &s;tretch forth his hand, that it might &s;erve him in the dark in&s;tead of Eies, and feeling about, he laid it upon a head, which he imagin'd did belong to a woman, by the dre&s;s and &s;liding his hand a little lower, he found by a plump, round pair of brea&s;ts, that he was not deceived, with this he con|cluded that this was his la&s;t nights com|panion, which he had &s;o fortunately met with by mi&s;taking her Chamber for his; and hearing no body &s;tirring, he concluded al&s;o that her Husband by a|like mi&s;take, might be got to his bed, This having enboldned <HI>Le Noble,</HI> he took the liberty to embrace his bed fellow, and to whi&s;per in her ear, who he was, and how he had come thither, de&s;iring her to make no noi&s;e, and after &s;ome little bu&s;le which &s;he made at the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;al, he had time to tell her. Seeing in &s;pight of her Jealous Husbands ill humour, it had pleas'd fortune to bring them in bed together, &s;he was to conclude that the fates had decreed it &s;o. The rather
<PB N="63" REF="38"> too, becau&s;e her Husband did give them &s;o fair an opportunity, by his ab&s;ence, though, he &s;uppo&s;ed, much again&s;t his will, that therefore &s;he was not to refu&s;e him, what his good fortune had &s;o bountifully be|&s;towed upon him, &s;he made &s;ome &s;light re&s;i&s;tance, and pleaded much the un|ju&s;tice of the action, to which <HI>Le Noble</HI> having made &s;uch an&s;wers as brought her to &s;ay, but Lord what would my Husband &s;ay &s;hould he know it, he found by that, that the fort was yielding, therefore, after &s;ome more few kind words and Care&s;&s;es, he made u&s;e of this op|portunity, to revenge him&s;elf upon the Wife, of the Husbands rude|ne&s;s to him.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;tay with her &s;he would have had <HI>Le Noble</HI> gone, but he plead|ed, he knew not whither he &s;hould go, thus naked as he was, for there was no que&s;tion but her Husband having got to bed to his bedfellow, who he had doubtle&s;s taken for her, he was fa&s;t enough till morning; and that &s;o &s;oon as day &s;hould but ne'r
<PB N="64" REF="39"> &s;o little appear, he would leave her, though to his very great regret, with that they renewed their Care&s;&s;es, &s;o that they were very well &s;atisfied with one anothers Company.</P>
<P>A little before break of day, as they had concluded it, between them, <HI>Le Noble</HI> having taken leave of his kind bedfellow, he goes out of the Cham|ber leaving the door open after him to &s;hift for him&s;elf till the door of his Chamber was opened, but pa&s;&s;ing by it, he could not forbear trying whe|ther it was open or not, having lift|ed the latch, the door yielded to him, he pre&s;ently gets in, and makes &s;ome kind of noi&s;e on purpo&s;e, that it &s;hould he heard, but the fir&s;t time falling of his expectation, he made &s;uch a noi&s;e, that our jealous man being awakened by it, who thought pre|&s;ently, that it was &s;ome body to rob him of the jewel his Wife, or to &s;teal &s;omething el&s;e, with &s;uch like thoughts, he gets out of lied, and having cry'd, <HI>qui Va la:</HI> he pre&s;ently makes towards the door, which find|ing clo&s;e &s;hut, but neither lockt nor

<P>Not long after day appear'd, and pre&s;ently comes one up kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">king at every Chamber door, to give notice that it was time to ri&s;e, in&s;tantly the Window Curtains began to be drawn in every Chamber, and a noi&s;e heard, which &s;till encrea&s;ed as pa&s;&s;engers were ri&s;ing and getting ready.</P>
<P>You may imagine that <HI>Le Noble</HI> was none of the la&s;t, for the ha&s;t he
<PB N="66" REF="40"> had to bid his &s;weet fellow, good mor|row, he gets him&s;elf ready, and goes out of his Chamber: our Jealous Hu&s;|band was the fir&s;t that <HI>Le Noble</HI> met with in the pa&s;&s;age, they bid one ano|ther good morrow, <HI>Le Noble</HI> told him, that he hoped that he was not &s;o angry with him as he &s;eem'd to be the night before, the Husband (who&s;e anger was over) an&s;wer'd him, that he begg'd his pardon, but that it was her cro&s;s humour, and ob&s;tinacy, that had &s;et him &s;o out of humour: <HI>Le Noble</HI> return'd him his Comple|ment, and told him that for his part, he never us'd to carry &s;uch things long in his mind, for proof whereof he would de&s;ire him and his bed-fellow, to take part of a breakfa&s;t, with him and his bed-fellow, the good man, who was as covetous as Jealous, (tho&s;e two pa&s;&s;ions commonly go|ing together) return'd him ma|ny thanks, and told him, that &s;o &s;oon as his Wife were ready, they would both wait on him in his Chamb|er, and that he would go in, to awak|en her, <HI>Le Noble</HI> de&s;ired him to for|bear,
<PB N="67" REF="40"> telling him it was yet early e|nough, that it was the Coaches Cu|&s;tome, alwaies to call two hours for their Pa&s;&s;engers before their Hor&s;es were ready, and that peradventure &s;he had not &s;lept well that night, he made an&s;wer, that to his knowledge, &s;he had &s;lept all night like a Town Top, and not &s;o much as &s;tirr'd, with that he retires into his Chamber, and <HI>Le No|ble,</HI> goes down &s;tairs into the Kitch|ing, to be-&s;peak a breakfa&s;t, &s;o re|turning to his Chamber again, he found his Chamber fellow ri&s;ing, hav|ing bid him good morrow, he return'd him thanks for his kindne&s;s, when he was de&s;titute of a bed, after &s;ome more Complements of the &s;ame na|ture, according to the French cu&s;tome, what &s;hall we have for breakfa&s;t, &s;ayes the Gentleman.

<PB N="68" REF="41"> night by fire, which might have been of very evil con&s;equence, near &s;o ma|ny &s;tables, had it not been &s;o happi|ly prevented, with that they reflected on an hundred accidents that are apt to befal Travellers, not only in their Inns, but on the Rode al&s;o, to which was added the churli&s;h and dogged humours of Coachmen, and they concluded, with the unrea&s;onable|ne&s;s of the Ho&s;ts in their reckon|ing.</P>
<P>By this time they were ready, and <HI>Le Noble</HI> hearing the Gentlewomans voyce, after the French airy manner which he had naturally, <HI>Bonjour, Bon|jour, Madamoi&s;elle,</HI> &s;ayes he aloud, what is it not breakfa&s;t time with you yet? I fear you have not had a good nights re&s;t, continued he, you &s;peak &s;o faintly this morning, to which &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he never had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> more plea&s;ant night, and &s;uch re&s;t as &s;he wi&s;h'd &s;he might enjoy often; which &s;he believ'd was caus'd partly by her &s;itting up late, and the &s;atisfaction which &s;he had la&s;t night in his agreeable con|ver&s;ation, for proof whereof, &s;he was
<PB N="69" REF="41"> almo&s;t dre&s;s'd, and ready to take a good &s;hare of that breakfa&s;t, which her Husband had inform'd her that he had invited them unto. By that, both the Companies being ready, they met in the pa&s;&s;age, where they re|new'd their di&s;cour&s;e, in a plea&s;ant way of raillery upon the la&s;t nights acci|dent, and the di&s;order it would have &s;et them all in, had it continued long|er, every one giving his &s;en&s;e upon it, according to his fancy, with this a Servant comes up, to know where they would have the Cloath laid, they not agreeing in who&s;e Chamber, they all went down into the Parler, where they found their breakfa&s;t waiting for them, pre&s;ently they fell to it, and forks being wanting, the Gentlewoman de|&s;ired her Husband to fetch down hers and her Spoon, which &s;he commonly carryed with her, when &s;he Travell'd, which the Husband did accordingly, they had in that Interval, a little more lea&s;ure to contemplate one another, by day light, though amorous glances, had not been wanting between them, all the while before, &s;ome blu&s;hes, which

Among&s;t the re&s;t of my Suiters, for I had many and of all &s;orts, there was one that the good man did approve of; he was an ill bred Chip of an rough hewen block: And doubtle&s;s, directly de&s;cended from the ancient family of the Clowns, and nearly allied to that of the <HI>La Fooles:</HI> But he was very rich, and a thriv|ing man, and con&s;equently e&s;teem'd a very fit match for me, by my good Unkle, who did not con&s;ider that it was very rea&s;onable if he would cut that I &s;hould choo&s;e, however I was of

<P>He was a Scotchman by Birth, a &s;hirk by Education, a Pedant by Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, a Bea&s;t in manners, and a Knave by nature.
