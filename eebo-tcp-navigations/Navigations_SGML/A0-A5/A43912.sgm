<HEAD>FOR LUCINDA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Poem of <HI>Tarquin</HI> and <HI>Lucretia</HI> challenges your Patronage and Protection: for I'le a&s;sure you, had it not been for your &s;trict Injunctions, it had never &s;een the light. But &s;ince the &s;ub|ject was of &s;o virtuous a Lady as <HI>Lucretia,</HI> and &s;o inge|nuous a Per&s;on laid her commands on me to Publi&s;h it; I was re&s;olved to give way whatever were the hazard of it, and let <HI>Lucretia</HI> come to ki&s;s your hands in that in|nocent Garb &s;he us'd to wear, and that mode&s;t Behave that us'd alwayes to accompany her Port aire and acti|ons. But I must beg pardon for all the faults, for being on another more &s;erious &s;ubject, I could not review it as I would; neither do I but by accident make Ver&s;e my &s;tudy, yet for diverti&s;ements from my unhappy troubles which you know attend me, I &s;ometimes u&s;e to make it my re|creation. I de&s;ign'd this Poem as I was walking one Morn among the little Trees of my Wilderne&s;s, and writ
<PB REF="3">mo&s;t if it down the &s;ame day, and &s;o as it is, &s;end it you. What errors there are, pray tell me, and I will amend it in the next Edition, and that's fair. In the mean time you must needs be my Champione&s;s to defend me again&s;t the cen&s;ure and malice of the Age, and then I doubt not but this Poem will find favour among all the Courtly and Generous world, as <HI>Lucretia</HI> her &s;elf mu&s;t needs oblige the concern of your &s;elf, and compa&s;&s;ion of all the cha&s;t and well di&s;po&s;ed. A virtuous di&s;po&s;ition is commendable in all, but mo&s;t in tho&s;e who&s;e great beauty renders them lyable to many temptations, but yet &s;corn to be allured by the guilded folly and gaudy non&s;ence of the times, but their affections are wrought upon by brave temper, honour, and worthine&s;s. How far doth our <HI>Lucretia</HI> differ from the lewdne&s;s of the world, who&s;e aiery Nimphs e&s;teem wantonne&s;s, well manag'd, the be&s;t part of their Portion; when doubtle&s;s, &s;weetne&s;s and mode&s;ty, added to native Beauty, are infinitely the be&s;t accompli&s;hments in a wo|man, under&s;tanding how to value a noble friend&s;hip be|yond vitious extravagances. Poor <HI>Lucretia</HI> de&s;erves the concern of all for her Misfortune, and vindicati|on of all for her Affection and Loyalty: which mu&s;t not be judged as wholly impeach'd, though &s;ullyed by this Rape; but yet much redeemed by her Trouble, Angui&s;h, and Death. For &s;uch Accidents may inevitably fall out &s;ome times, though women &s;tand on never &s;o strict a Guard; though they are genuinly of never &s;o virtuous a temper, yet their tender natures are lyable to be frighted into &s;e|veral inconveniencies they were unwary off. Poor <HI>Lu|cretia</HI>'s floods of Tears had expiated her Crime, if that could be called a Crime, which could not be help'd, but by killing her &s;elf fir&s;t, which though &s;he had better have done before than after, So that by this di&s;aster, the
<PB REF="3">Ladies of our times may learn to be fore-witted. A Wife that is constant, and abominates di&s;loyalty, as did <HI>Lucretia,</HI> de&s;erves the Love of her Husband, Defence of Nations, and Warrs of Kingdomes for her; but tho&s;e that &s;hall voluntarily unvail their Mode&s;ty, and profane their &s;acred Vowes at the Altar, and joyn in Con|federacy again&s;t Loyalty. no puni&s;hment is too bad for them; but &s;uch low and mean &s;pirits, de&s;erve the &s;corn of all mankind: Though their vice is clothed with never &s;o much Grandeur, yet they appear too ba&s;e and unworthy for the Heroick world to own or regard them: Their whole Lives being infamous, and their Actions black and fooli&s;h: Their Beauty it &s;elf afterwards proves but the Trumpet to make known their di&s;grace; &s;o much the more I would have all Ladies e&s;teem their Honor, and put a value on Chastity in a Cottage, before the glorious Addre&s;&s;es of Crowns and Empires with Di&s;honesty: For the Lines of their Faces are by it &s;o altered, that after|wards all their Garb, Paint, and Impudence, can never &s;et them right again in the view of the world: And their Deport makes thou&s;ands of others &s;ober and harmle&s;ly free women fare the wor&s;e for them. But whither do I run? Dear Madam, I hope you'l pardon this Digre&s;&s;ion. For the honoured value I have for your Sex, makes me (being on a &s;ubject tending this way) give a word or two of caution to the wilder &s;ort. For Love ought either not at all to be pretended, or if it be, to be maintained with the greate&s;t Piety and Con&s;tancy in the world. I under&s;tand no Plea&s;ure on Earth, but Philo&s;ophy and Love; one for the &s;erious part of Life, the other for the merry. For all the Grandeurs we have, tend to this of Love at the la&s;t. What &s;ignifies all the Riches, fine Hou&s;es, fine Coaches, Garb, Splendor, and Equipage,
<PB REF="4">but to endeer and entertain the Per&s;ons they Love. And as Love is that which cau&s;eth mo&s;t plea&s;ure and &s;atisfacti|on, &s;o women are the proper and natural Centure of it. What dull Sports are all the Exerci&s;es of Hawks, Hounds, Hor&s;es, and Drinking, to this of adoring your Sex. Society is the Life of Life, and Women the Life of all Society. And lovely women that are virtuous, the very Angels of this world. Wherefore I would have them do nothing that may render them otherwi&s;e than the Starrs and Lu&s;tre of the Creation, but wearing Souls stampt with the Glory of the Antient Heroes, may like little Deities &s;oar above the ordinary Rank of Mortals: When others chaining their Lives to dark and crocked wayes, live clouded and &s;can|dalou&s;ly, and at la&s;t, &s;neak out of the world pittifully; while the truly Virtuous and Gallant per&s;ons, are happy in them&s;elves, good to others, merit the Lawrels of the wi&s;e, and ride triumphant on the Acclamations of the whole world. And after they have by the odours of their virtues perfum'd the Age they live in, Immortal Story remembers them to Posterity by Deeds truly Heroick and Honourable. But no more of this now, le&s;t I make my Epistle &s;well into a Volumne, though all I have &s;aid, Ma|dam, is but to Come to you at la&s;t, who &s;hew your good In|clinations, by having &s;uch a Concern for this excellent Lady. And as the brave&s;t temper is to be plea&s;ant in all Conditions whatever, yet not in&s;en&s;ible of the nature of any Condition. To be one can reach at Crowns, or dwell in an Hermitage. So you, Madam. under&s;tand all the Modes and Meanders of women, and remain at la&s;t ge|nerous; having the gift al&s;o to be lively and well plea&s;ed at all times; and can be complei&s;ant when you ought to be &s;o, and at other times re&s;erved. You can be merry, when you may do it with Conveniency, or otherwi&s;e, be
<PB REF="4">as well contented to be contriving your Hou&s;hold affairs. I know al&s;o you hate penuriou&s;ne&s;s as one of the De|vils on Earth, e&s;teeming it meer madne&s;s to live &s;or|didly to dye rich. I dare &s;ay this is much your humour, and &s;o I'le leave you at the pre&s;ent in the mid&s;t of all your happine&s;s and plea&s;ant de&s;ign.</P>
