<HEAD>A Brief Account of the Province of <HI>Penn&s;ilvania</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> lately granted under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>William Penn,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THe King having been favourably plea&s;ed after a long Solicitation, in Right of my Fathers Services, and a con&s;iderable part of his E&s;tate, to confer and &s;ettle upon me, and my Heirs, a Tract of Land in <HI>America,</HI> by the name of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania;</HI> with the powers requi&s;ite to the well government thereof; I thought good to publi&s;h this abreviated account of the former Relation, as le&s;s trouble&s;om to Send or Read, for their Satisfa|ction, that are &s;oberly de&s;irous and re&s;olved for tho&s;e parts of the World.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> Something of the Place.</HEAD>
<P>The Place lies 600 Miles nearer the <HI>Sun</HI> than <HI>England,</HI> for <HI>England</HI> begins at the 50th. Degree and ten Mi|nutes of <HI>North</HI> Latitude, and this place begins at 40. which is about the Latitude of <HI>Naples</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> or <HI>Mom|pellier</HI> in <HI>France:</HI> I &s;hall &s;ay little in its prai&s;e to excite de&s;ires in any; whatever I could truly write as to the Soil, Air and Water, this &s;hall &s;atisfie me, that by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, and the Hone&s;ty and Indu&s;try of man, it may be a good and Fruitful Land.</P>
<P>For Navigation, it is &s;aid to have two Conveniencies, the one by lying Nine&s;core Miles upon <HI>Delaware</HI> River, that is to &s;ay, about 70 Miles, before we come to the Falls, where a Ve&s;&s;el of 200 Tuns may Sail, (and &s;ome Creeks and &s;mall Harbours in that di&s;tance, where Ships may come nearer than the Rivers in the Country) and above the Falls for Boats, the other Convenience is through <HI>Che&s;papeak-Bay,</HI> the head falling within this La|titude.</P>
<P>For Timber &amp; other Wood, there is Variety for the u&s;e of man, as <HI>Oak, Che&s;nut, Wallnut, Popler, Cedar, Beech,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>For <HI>Fowl, Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Wild Deer,</HI> they are reported to be plentiful in tho&s;e parts, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Provi&s;ion grows there, and is to be had at rea&s;onable Rates: The Commodities that the Countrey is thought to be capable of, are <HI>Silk, Flax, Hemp, Wine, Sider, Wood, Madder, Liquori&s;h, Tobacco, Pota&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Iron;</HI> and it doth actually produce <HI>Hides, Tallow, Pipe&s;taves, Beef, Pork, Sheep, Wool, Corn,</HI> as <HI>Wheat, Barly, Rye,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Furrs,</HI> as your <HI>Beaver, Peltree, Mincks, Racoons, Martins,</HI> and &s;uch like; &s;tore of which is to be found among the <HI>Indians,</HI> that are profitable Commodities in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The way of Trading in tho&s;e Countries, is thus, they &s;end to the <HI>Southern</HI> Plantations, <HI>Corn, Beef, Pork, Fi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Pip&s;taves,</HI> and take their Growth and bring for <HI>England,</HI> and return with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods to their own Countrey; their <HI>Furrs</HI> they bring for <HI>England,</HI> and either &s;ell them here, or carry them out again to other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where they will yield a better price: And for tho&s;e that will follow Merchandize and Navi|gation, there is conveniency, and <HI>Timber</HI> &s;ufficient for Shipping.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> The Constitutions.</HEAD>
<P>For the Con&s;titution of the Countrey, the Patent &s;hows. <HI>First, That the People and Governour have a</HI> Le|gi&s;lative <HI>Power; &s;o that no Law can be made, nor Money rai&s;ed, but by the peoples con&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>That the Rights and Freedoms of</HI> England (the be&s;t and large&s;t in <HI>Europe) &s;hall be in force there.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>That making no Law again&s;t Allegiance</HI> (which &s;hould we, twere by the Law of <HI>England</HI> void of it &s;elf that Moment) <HI>we may Enact what Laws we plea&s;e for the Good, Pro&s;perity and Security of the</HI> &s;aid Province.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. That &s;o &s;oon as any are Ingaged with me, we &s;hall begin a Scheam or Draught together, &s;uch as &s;hall give Ample Te&s;timony of my &s;incere Inclinations to Encourage Planters, and &s;ettle a Free, Ju&s;t and In|du&s;trious <HI>Colony</HI> there.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III. The Conditions.</HEAD>
<P>My Conditions will relate to three &s;orts of People. <HI>1&s;t.</HI> Tho&s;e that will buy. <HI>2dly.</HI> Tho&s;e that take up Land upon Rent. <HI>3dly.</HI> Servants. To the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> The &s;hares I &s;ell &s;hall be certain, as to number of Acres; that is to &s;ay, every one &s;hall contain five thou&s;and Acres, free from any <HI>Indian</HI> Incumbrance, the Price a Hundred Pounds, and for the Quit Rent but one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shilling, or the value of it yearly for a hundred Acres, which &s;uch as will may now or hereafter buy of to an Incon&s;iderable matter; but as I hold by a &s;mall Rent of the King, &s;o all mu&s;t hold of me by &s;ome Rent, for their own Security, and the &s;aid Quit Rent not to be paid till <HI>1684.</HI> Or &s;uch as can only reach to &s;mall parcels, may ten of them buy, each <HI>500</HI> Acres, or any other part of a &s;hare, &s;o they be added together to make a Town&s;hip. To the <HI>&s;econd</HI> &s;ort that take up Land upon Rent, they &s;hall have liberty &s;o to do, paying yearly one Penny <HI>per</HI> Acre, not exceeding two hundred Acres. To the <HI>third</HI> &s;ort, to wit, Servants that are carried over, fifty Acres &s;hall be allowed to the Master for every Head, and fifty Acres to every Servant when their time is expired, as well Women as Men: And becau&s;e &s;ome Ingage with me that may not be di&s;po&s;ed to go, it were very advi&s;able for every four Sharers to &s;end an Over&s;eer, which would well pay the Cost.</P>
<P>The Divident may be thus, if the Per&s;ons concern'd plea&s;e, a Tract of Land &s;hall be &s;urvey'd; &s;ay fifty thou&s;and Acres to a hundred Adventurers, in which &s;ome of the be&s;t &s;hall be &s;et out for Town, or Cities, and there &s;hall be &s;o much ground alloted to each in tho&s;e Towns as may maintain &s;ome Cattle, and produce &s;ome Corn: Then the Re|mainder of the fifty thou&s;and Acres &s;hall be &s;hared among the &s;aid Adventurers, whereby every Adventurer will have a con&s;iderable quantity of Land together; likewi&s;e every one a proportion by a Navigable River, and then backward into the Countrey The manner of Divident I &s;hall not be &s;trict in; we can but &s;peak roughly of the matter here, but let men Skilful in Plantations be con&s;ulted, and I &s;hall leave it to the Majority of Votes among the Adventurers when it &s;hall plea&s;e God we come there, how to fix to their own content.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>IV.</HI> The&s;e Per&s;ons that Providence &s;eems to have mo&s;t fitted for Plantations, are</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Indu&s;trious Husbandmen, and day Labourers, that are hardly able (with extream Labour) to main|tain their Families and Portion their Children.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, Laborious Handicrafts, e&s;pecially Carpenters, Ma&s;ons, Smiths, Weavers, Taylors, Tanners, Shoe-makers, Ship-wrights, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where they may be &s;pared, or are low in the World; and as they &s;hall want no en|couragement, &s;o their Labour is worth more there than here, and their Provi&s;ion Cheaper.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. A Plantation &s;eems a fit place for tho&s;e Ingenious Spirits, that being low in the world, are much Clog'd and Oppre&s;&s;ed about a Livelyhood, for the means of Sub&s;i&s;ting being ea&s;ie there, they may have time and opportunity to gratifie their Inclinations, and thereby improve Science and help Nur&s;eries of People.</P>
<PB REF="2" MS="y">
<P N="4">4thly. A fourth &s;ort of men to whom a Plantation would be proper, takes in tho&s;e that are younger Brothers of &s;mall Inheritances; yet becau&s;e they would live in &s;ight of their Kindred in &s;ome proportion to their Quality, and can't do it without a Labour that looks like Farming; their Condition is too &s;traight for them, and, if married, their Children are often too numerous for the E&s;tate, and are frequently brought up to no Trades, but are a kind of hangers on, or retainers to the Elder Brothers Table and Charity; which is a mi&s;|chief, as in it &s;elf to be lamented, &s;o here to be remedied; for Land they have next to nothing, which (with moderate Labour) produces Plenty of all things nece&s;&s;ary for Life, and &s;uch an Increa&s;e as by Traffique may &s;upply them with all Conveniencies.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there are another &s;ort of per&s;ons not only fit for, but nece&s;&s;ary in Plantations; and that is, men of univer&s;al Spirits, that have an eye to the good of Po&s;terity, and that both under&s;tand and delight to promote good Di&s;cipline and ju&s;t Government among a plain and well-intending people; &s;uch Per&s;ons may find room in <HI>Colonies</HI> for their good Coun&s;el and Contrivance, who are &s;hut out from being of much u&s;e or &s;ervice to great Nations, under &s;ettled Cu&s;toms.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>V.</HI> The Journey and its Appurtinances, and what is to be done there at fir&s;t coming</HEAD>
<P>Next let us &s;ee, what is fit for the journey and place, when there, and al&s;o what may be the Charge of the Voyage, and what is to be expected and done there at fir&s;t That &s;uch as incline to go may not be to &s;eek here, or brought under any di&s;appointment there, the Goods fit to take with them for u&s;e, or &s;ell for profit, are all &s;orts of Apparel, and Uten&s;ils for Husbandry and Building, and Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff. And becau&s;e I know how much people are apt to fancy things beyond what they are, and that imaginations are great flatterers of the minds of men: to the end that none may delude them&s;elves with an expectation of an immediate amend|ment of their Conditions; &s;o &s;oon as it &s;hall plea&s;e God they arrive there, I would have them under&s;tand, That <HI>they mu&s;t look for a Winter before a Summer comes;</HI> and they mu&s;t be willing to be two or three years without &s;ome of the Conveniencies they enjoy at home: And yet I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, That <HI>America</HI> is another thing than it was at the fir&s;t Plantation of <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>New-England;</HI> for there is better Accomodation, and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Provi&s;ions are to be had at ea&s;ier rates. However I am inclin'd to &s;et down particulars, as near as tho&s;e inform me that know the place, and have been Planters both in that, and in the neighbouring <HI>Colonies.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The pa&s;&s;age will come for Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to about five Pounds ten Shillings a Head, for Ser|vants five Pounds a Head, and for Children under &s;even years of age fifty &s;hillings, except they &s;uck, then nothing.</P>
<P>Next being (by the Mercy of God) &s;afely Arrived in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> two men may clear as much Ground by Spring (when they &s;et the Corn of that Country) as will bring in that time twelve Month for|ty Barrels, which amounts to two Hundred Bu&s;hels, which makes twenty five Quarters of Corn; &s;o that the fir&s;t year they mu&s;t buy Corn, which is u&s;ually very plentiful: They may &s;o &s;oon as they come, buy Cowes, more or le&s;s, as they want, or are able, which are to be had at ea&s;ie Rates; For Swine, they are plentiful and Cheap, the&s;e will quickly Increa&s;e to a Stock, &s;o that after the fir&s;t year, what with the Poorer &s;ort, &s;ometimes labouring to others; and the more able Fi&s;hing, Fowling, and &s;ometime buying, they may do very well, till their own Stocks are &s;ufficient to &s;upply them and their Families, which will quickly be and to &s;pare, if they follow the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Husbandry, as they do in <HI>New-England,</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> and get <HI>Winter</HI> Fodder for their Stock.</P>
<P>To conclude, I de&s;ire all my dear Country Folks, who may be inclin'd to go into tho&s;e parts, to con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly the Premi&s;&s;es, as well the pre&s;ent inconveniencies, as future Ea&s;e and Plenty, that &s;o none may move ra&s;hly. nor from a Fickle, but Solid Mind, having above all things an Eye to the Providence of God in the di&s;po&s;al of them&s;elves: And I would further advi&s;e all &s;uch, at lea&s;t to have the Permi&s;&s;ion, if not the good liking of their near Relations, for that is both Natural, and a Duty Incumbent upon all, and by this means will Natural Affection be pre&s;erved, and Friendly and Profitable Corre&s;pondence be maintained be|tween them; in all which I be&s;eech Almighty God to direct us, that his Ble&s;&s;ing may attend our Hone&s;t In|deavour, and then the Con&s;equence of all our Undertaking will turn to the Glory of his great Name, and the true Happine&s;s of us and our Po&s;terity, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
