<P>THe wi&s;e Creator of the univer&s;all Globe, hath placed a golden meane betwixt two extreames: I meane the temperate Zones, betwixt the hote and cold; and every Creature, that participates of Heavens ble&s;&s;ings, with in the Compa&s;&s;e of that golden meane, is made mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="7">apt and fit, for man to u&s;e, who likewi&s;e by that wi&s;e|dome is ordained to be the Lord of all. This globe may be his gla&s;&s;e, to teach him how to u&s;e modera|tion, and di&s;cretion, both in his actions and intentions. The wi&s;e man &s;ayes, give mee neither riches nor po|verty; why? Riches might make him proud like Nebuchadnezar, and poverty de&s;paire, like Iobs wife; but a meane betweene both.<NOTE PLACE="marg">V&s;e of vege|tatives.</NOTE> So it is likewi&s;e in the u&s;e of Vegetatives, that which hath too much Heate or too much Colde, is &s;aid to be venenum, &s;o in the u&s;e of &s;en&s;itives, all tho&s;e Animals, of what ge|nus or &s;pecies &s;oever they be, if they participate of heate or cold, in the &s;uperlative, are &s;aid to be <HI>Inimi|ca naturae,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;h poy&s;o|nous about the I&s;le of Sall.</NOTE> as in &s;ome Fi&s;hes about the I&s;le of Sall, and tho&s;e Ilandes adjoyninge, betweene the Tropickes, their participatinge of heate and cold, in the &s;uperla|tive is made mo&s;t manife&s;t, one of which, poy&s;oned a whole Ships company that eate of it. And &s;o it is in Vipers, Toades, and Snakes, that have heate or cold in the &s;uperlative degree.</P>
<P>Therefore the Creatures that participate of heate and cold in a meane, are be&s;t and hol&s;ome&s;t: And &s;o it is in the choy&s;e of love, the middell Zone be|tweene the two extreames is be&s;t, and it is therefore called <HI>Zona temperata,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zona tem|perata, the Golden meane.</NOTE> and is in the golden meane; and all tho&s;e Landes lying under that Zone, mo&s;t requi&s;ite and fitt for habitation. In Co&s;mography, the two extreames are called, the one
<HI>Torrida Zona,</HI> lying be|tweene the Tropickes, the other <HI>Frigida Zona,</HI> lying neare the Poles: all the landes lying under, either of the&s;e Zones, by rea&s;on, they doe participate too
<PB N="13" REF="7">much of heate or cold, are very inconvenient, and are accompanied with many evils. And allthough I am not of opinion with Ari&s;totle, that the landes un|der <HI>Torrida Zona,</HI> are alltogether uninhabited, I my &s;elfe having beene &s;o neare the equinoctiall line, that I have had the Sunn for my Zenith, and &s;eene proofe to the contrary, yet cannot I deny, but that it is accom|panied with many inconveniences, as that Fi&s;h and Fle&s;h both will taint in tho&s;e partes, notwith&s;tanding the u&s;e of Salt which cannot be wanting there, ordai|ned by natures hande-worke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt aboun|deth under the Tropicks.</NOTE> And that is a great hinderance to the &s;ettinge forth and &s;upply of naviga|tion, the very Sinewes of a flori&s;hing Common|wealth. Then barrenne&s;&s;e, cau&s;ed through want of raines, for in mo&s;t of tho&s;e partes of the world it is &s;eldome accu&s;tomed to raine, untill the time of the Tornathees (as the Portingals phra&s;e is, who lived there) and then it will raine about 40. dayes toge|ther,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Raine <HI>40.</HI> dayes about Augu&s;t be|tweene Can|cer and the Line.</NOTE> which moi&s;ture &s;erveth to fructify the earth for all the yeare after, duringe which time is &s;eene no raine at all: the heate and cold, and length of day and night, being much alike, with little difference. And the&s;e raines are cau&s;ed by the turning of the windes, which el&s;e betweene the Tropickes, doe blow Trade, that is allwayes one way. For next the Tropicke of Cancer it is con&s;tantly North-Ea&s;t, and next the Tro|picke of Capricorne it is Southwe&s;t; &s;o that the windes comming from the Poles, do keepe the aire in tho&s;e partes coole, and make it temperate and the partes habitable, were it not for tho&s;e and other inconve|niences.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="8"> This <HI>Torrida Zona</HI> is good for Gra&s;hoppers: and <HI>Zona Temperata</HI> for the Ant and Bee. But <HI>Frigida Zona</HI> good for neither, as by lamentable experience of Captaine Davis Fate, is manife&s;t, who in his in|que&s;t of the Nortwe&s;t pa&s;&s;age for the Ea&s;t India trade was frozen to death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. Davis froze to death.</NOTE> And thefore for <HI>Frigida Zona,</HI> I agree with Ari&s;totle, that it is unfit for habitation: and I know by the Cour&s;e of the caele&s;tiall globe, that in Groeneland many Degrees &s;hort of the Pole Articke, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Groene Land too cold for habitation.</NOTE> the place is too cold, by rea&s;on of the Sunns ab&s;ence almo&s;t &s;ix monethes, and the land under the continuall power of the fro&s;t; which thinge many more Navigators have prooved with pittifull expe|rience of their wintringe there, as appeareth by the hi&s;tory, I thinke, they will not venture to winter there againe for an India mine.</P>
<P>And as it is found by our Nation under the Pole Articke, &s;o it is likewi&s;e to be found under the Antar|ticke Pole, yet what hazard will not an indu&s;trious minde, and couragious &s;pirit undergoe, according to that of the Poe~t. <HI>Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos per mare pauperiem fugiens, per &s;axa, per ignes.</HI> And all to gett and hord up like the Ant and the Bee, and yet as Salomon &s;aith, hee cannot tell whether a foole or a wi&s;e man &s;hall enjoy it. Therefore let us leave the&s;e two extreames, with their inconveniences, and indeavour to finde out this golden meane, &s;o free from any one of them. Behold the &s;ecret wi&s;e|dome of allmighty God, and love unto, our Salomon to rai&s;e a man of a lardge hart, full of worthy abilities to be the Index or Load&s;tarre, that doth point out
<PB N="15" REF="8">unto the Engli&s;h Nation, with ea&s;e and comfort how to finde it out. And this the noble minded Gentle|man, Sir Ferdinando Gorges Knight, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir Ferdi|nando Gorges the originall cau&s;e of plan|tinge New England.</NOTE> zealous for the glory of God, the honor of his Maje&s;ty, and the bene|fit of the weale publicke, hath done a great worke for the good of his Country.</P>
<P>And herein this, the wondrous wi&s;edome and love of God, is &s;hewne, by &s;ending to the place his Mini&s;ter, to &s;weepe away by heapes the Salvages, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages dyed of the Plague.</NOTE> and al&s;o giving him length of dayes, to &s;ee the &s;ame per|formed after his enterpri&s;e was begunne, for the pro|pagation of the Church of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>This judicious Gentleman, hath found this goul|den meane, to be &s;cituated about the middle of tho&s;e two extreames, and for directions you may proove it thus: Counting the &s;pace betweene the Line and ei|ther of the Poles, in true proportion, you &s;hall finde it to be 90. Degrees: then mu&s;t we finde the meane, to be neare unto the Center of 90. and that is about 45. Degrees, and then incline unto the Sotherne &s;ide of that Center, properly for the benefit of heate, re|membringe that <HI>Sol &amp; Homo generat hominem;</HI> and then keepe us on that fame &s;ide, and &s;ee what Land is to be found there, and we &s;hall ea&s;ily di&s;cerne that new Eng|land is on the South &s;ide of that Center.</P>
<P>For that Country doth beginne her boundes at 40. Degrees of Northerne latitude,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Engl. is placed in the golden meane.</NOTE> and endes at 45. Degrees of the &s;ame latitude, and doth participate of heate and cold indifferently, but is oppre&s;&s;ed with neither: and therefore may be truly &s;ayd to be within the compa&s;&s;e of that golden meane, mo&s;t apt and fit
<PB N="16" REF="9">for habitation and generation, being placed by All|mighty God the great Creator, under that Zone, cal|led <HI>Zona temperata,</HI> and is therefore mo&s;t fitt for the generation and habitation of our Engli&s;h nation, of all other, who are more neere neighbours to the Nor|therne Pole, who&s;e Land lyeth betweene 50. and 54.

Degrees of latitude, <NOTE PLACE="marg">New Eng|land <HI>10.</HI> De|grees neerer the line then old England.</NOTE> yet doth not this exceede that other in heate or cold, by rea&s;on of the cituation of it; for as the Coa&s;t lyeth, being circular|ly Northea&s;t and Southwe&s;t, oppo&s;ite towards the Sunnes ri&s;inge, which makes his cour&s;e over the O|cean, it can have litle or no reflecting, heat of the Sun|beames, by rea&s;on of the continuall motion of the waters, makinge the aire there the cooler and the con&s;tanter: &s;o that for the temperature of the Climent, &s;weetne&s;&s;e of the aire, fertility of the Soile, and &s;mall number of the Salvages (which might &s;eeme a rubb in the way off an effeminate minde,) this Country of new England is by all judicious men, accounted the principall part of all America, for habitation and the commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Sea, Ships there not being &s;ubject to wormes, as in Virginea and other places, and not to be paraleld in all Chri&s;tendome.

<P>THis is a thinge not onely ob&s;erved by mee, and diver&s;e of the Salvages of New England, but al&s;o, by the French men in Nova Francia, and therefore I am the more incouraged to publi&s;h in this Treatice my ob&s;ervation of them, in the u&s;e of theire &s;ences: which is a thinge that I &s;hould not ea&s;ily have bin induced, to beleeve, if I my &s;elfe, had not bin an eie witne&s;&s;e, of what I &s;hall relate.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages have the &s;ence of &s;ee|inge better then the Eng|li&s;h.</NOTE>I have ob&s;erved, that the Salvages have the &s;ence of &s;eeing &s;o farre beyond any of our Nation, that one would allmo&s;t beleeve they had intelligence of the Devill, &s;ometimes: when they have tould us of a &s;hipp at Sea, which they have &s;eene,
<PB N="48" REF="25">&s;oener by one hower, yea two howers &s;ayle, then any Engli&s;h man that &s;tood by; of purpo&s;e to looke out, their &s;ight is &s;o excellent.</P>
<P>Their eies indeede are black as iett; and that co|ler is accounted the &s;tronge&s;t for &s;ight. And as they excell us in this particular &s;o much noted, &s;o I thinke they excell us in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This I am &s;ure, I have well ob&s;erved, that in the &s;ence of &s;melling, they have very great perfection: which is confirmed by the opinion of the French, that are planted about Canada, who have made relation, That they are &s;o perfect in the u&s;e of that &s;ence, that they will di&s;tingui&s;h between a Spaniard and a French|man by the &s;ent of the hand onely.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Salvages that will di&s;tingui&s;h a Spaniard from a french man by the &s;mell of the hand.</NOTE> And I am per|&s;waded, that the Author of this Relation has &s;eene very probable rea&s;ons, that have iuduced him, to be of that opinion; and I am the more willing to give credit thereunto, becau&s;e I have ob&s;erved in them &s;o much, as that comes to.</P>
<P>I have &s;eene a Deare pa&s;&s;e by me upon a neck of Land, and a Salvage that has pur&s;ued him by the view.</P>
<P>I have accompanied him in this pur&s;uite; and the Salvage, princking the Deare, comes where hee findes the view of two deares together, leading &s;everal wayes. One hee was &s;ure, was fre&s;h, but which (by the &s;ence of &s;eeing) hee could not judge, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Deare pur|&s;ued by the view of the, foote, hee was found and killed.</NOTE> therefore, with his knife, hee diggs up the earth of one; and by &s;melling, &s;ayes, that was not of the fre&s;h Deare: the diggs hee up the other; and viewing and &s;melling to that, concludes it to be the view of the fre&s;h Deare, which hee had pur&s;ued, and thereby followes the cha&s;e and killes that

<P>ALthough the&s;e Salvages are found to be without Religion, Law, and King (as Sir William Alex|ander hath well ob&s;erved,) yet are they not altoge|ther without the knowledge of God (hi&s;torically) for they have it among&s;t them by tradition, that God made one man and one woman, and bad them live to|gether, and get children, kill deare, bea&s;ts, birds, fi&s;h, and fowle, and what they would at their plea&s;ure; and that their po&s;terity was full of evill, and made God &s;o angry: that hee let in the Sea upon them, &amp; drowned the greate&s;t part of them, that were naughty men, (the Lord de&s;troyed &s;o.)</P>

For indeed in the grave of the more noble, they put a planck in the bottom for the corps to be layed upon; and on each &s;ide a plancke, and a plancke upon the top in forme of a che&s;t, before they cover the place with earth. This done, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man|ner of Mo|numents.</NOTE> they erect &s;ome thing over the grave in forme of a hear&s;e cloath, as was that of Cheekatawbacks mother, which the Plim|mouth planters defaced, becau&s;e they accounted it an act of &s;uper&s;tition.

<P><PB N="52" REF="27"> It was a thing very offen&s;ive to them, at our fir&s;t comming into tho&s;e parts, to a&s;ke of them for any one that had bin dead; but of later times it is not &s;o offen&s;ively taken, to renew the memory of any de|&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, becau&s;e by our example (which they are apt to followe) it is made more familiare unto them; and they marvell to &s;ee no monuments over our dead, and therefore thinke no great Sachem is yet come into tho&s;e parts: or not as yet deade, becau&s;e they &s;ee the graves all alike.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVIII.</HI> Of their Cu&s;tome in burning the Country, and the rea&s;on thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THe Salvages are accu&s;tomed, to &s;et fire of the Country in all places where they come; and to burne it, twize a yeare, vixe at the Spring, and the fall of the leafe. The rea&s;on that mooves them to doe &s;o, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salva|ges fire the Country twice a yeare.</NOTE> is becau&s;e it would other wi&s;e be &s;o over|growne with underweedes, that it would be all a cop|pice wood, and the people would not be able in any wi&s;e to pa&s;&s;e through the Country out of a beaten path.</P>
<P>The meanes that they do it with, is with cer|taine minerall &s;tones, rhat they carry about them: in baggs made for that purpo&s;e of the &s;kinnes of little bea&s;tes which they convert into good lether; carry|ing in the &s;ame a peece of touch wood (very excellent
<PB N="53" REF="27">for that purpo&s;e of their owne making. The&s;e mi|nerall &s;tones they have from the Piquenteenes (which is to the Southward of all the plantations in New Eng|land) by trade and trafficke with tho&s;e people.</P>
<P>The burning of the gra&s;&s;e de&s;troyes the under|woods, and &s;o &s;corcheth the elder trees, that it &s;hrinkes them, and hinders their grouth very much: So that hee that will looke to finde large trees, and good tymber, mu&s;t not depend upon the help, of a woodden pro&s;pect to finde them on the upland ground; but mu&s;t &s;eeke for them, (as I and others have done) in the lower grounds where the grounds are wett when the Country is fired: by rea&s;on of the &s;now water that remaines there for a time, untill the Sunne by continuance of that hath exhaled the vapoures of the earth, and dried up tho&s;e places, where the fire (by rea&s;on of the moi&s;ture) can have no power to doe them any hurt: and if he would endevoure to finde out any goodly Cedars, hee mu&s;t not &s;eeke for them on the higher grounds, but make his inque&s;t for them in the vallies, for the Salvages by this Cu&s;tome of theirs, have &s;poiled all the re&s;t: for this cu&s;tome hath bin continued from the beginninge.</P>
<P>And lea&s;t their firing of the Country in this man|ner; &s;hould be an occa&s;ion of damnifying us, and in|daingering our habitations; wee our &s;elves have u&s;ed carefully about the &s;ame times; to ob&s;erve the winds and fire the grounds about our owne habitations, to prevent the Dammage that might happen by any ne|glect thereof, if the fire &s;hould come neere tho&s;e how&s;es in our ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="28"> For when the fire is once kindled, it dilates and &s;preads it &s;elfe as well again&s;t, as with the winde; bur|ning continually night and day, untill a &s;hewer of raine falls to quench it.</P>
<P>And this cu&s;tome of firing the Country is the meanes to make it pa&s;&s;able, and by that meanes the trees growe here, and there as in our parks: and makes the Country very beautifull, and commodious.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIX.</HI> Of their inclination to Drunkenne&s;&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>ALthough Drunkenne&s;&s;e be ju&s;tly termed a vice, which the Salvages are ignorant of, yet the bene|fit is very great, that comes to the planters by the &s;ale of &s;trong liquor to the Salvages, who are much taken with the delight of it, for they will pawne their wits, to purcha&s;e the acquaintance of it, yet in al the co~merce that I had with them, I never proffered them any &s;uch thing; nay I would hardly let any of them have a drame unles hee were a Sachem, or a Winnaytue, that is a rich man, or a man of e&s;timation, next in degree to a Sa|chem, or Sagamore: I alwayes tould them it was a|mong&s;t us the Sachems drinke. But they &s;ay if I come to the Northerne parts of the Country. I &s;hall have no trade, if I will not &s;upply the~ lu&s;ty with liquors, it is the life of the trade, in all tho&s;e for parts, it &s;o happened, that thus a Salvage de&s;perately killed him&s;elfe, when hee was drunke, a gunne being charged and the cock up, hee &s;ets the mouth to his bre&s;t, and putting back the tricker with his foote, &s;hot him&s;elfe dead.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XX.</HI> That the Salvages live a contended life.</HEAD>
<P>A Gentleman and a traveller, that had bin in the parts of New England for a time, when hee retor|ned againe in his di&s;cour&s;e of the Country, wondered (as hee &s;aid,) that the natives of the land lived &s;o poorely, in &s;o rich a Country, like to our Beggers in England: Surely that Gentleman had not time or lea&s;ure whiles hee was there, truely to informe him&s;elfe of the &s;tate of that Country, and the happy life the Salvages would leade weare they once brought to Chri&s;tianity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salvages want the art of navigation</NOTE></P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e they want the u&s;e and benefit of Navigation (which is the very &s;innus of a flouri&s;hing Commonwealth,) yet are they &s;upplied with all manner of needefull things, for the maintenance of life and lifelyhood, Foode and rayment are the cheife of all that we make true u&s;e of; and of their they finde no want, but have, and may have, them in a mo&s;t plen|tifull manner.</P>
<P>If our beggers of England &s;hould with &s;o much ea&s;e (as they,) furni&s;h them&s;elves with foode, at all &s;ea&s;ons, there would not be &s;o many &s;tarved in the &s;treets, neither would &s;o many gaoles be &s;tuffed, or gallou&s;es furni&s;hed with poore wretches, as I have &s;eene them,</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="29"> But they of this &s;ort of our owne nation, that are fitt to goe to this Canaan are not able to tran&s;port them&s;elves, and mo&s;t of them unwilling to goe from the good ale tap; which is the very load&s;tone of the lande by which our Engli&s;h beggers &s;teere theire Cour&s;e: it is the Northpole to which the flowre-de|luce of the compa&s;&s;e points; the more is the pitty that the Commonalty of oure Land are of &s;uch leaden capacities, as to neglect &s;o brave a Country, that doth &s;o plentifully feede Maine lu&s;ty and a brave, able men, women, and children that have not the meanes that a Civilized Nation hath to purcha&s;e foode and rayment: which that Country with a little indu&s;try: will yeeld a man in a very comfortable mea|&s;ure; without overmuch carking.</P>
<P>I cannot deny but a civilized Nation, hath the preheminence of an uncivilized, by meanes of tho&s;e in&s;truments that are found to be common among&s;t civile people, and the uncivile want the u&s;e of, to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of tho&s;e ornaments, that make &s;uch a glorious &s;hew, that will give a man occa|&s;ion to cry, <HI>&s;ie tran&s;it gloria Mundi.</HI></P>
<P>Now &s;ince it is but foode and rayment that men that live needeth (though not all alike,) why &s;hould not the Natives of New England be &s;ayd to live richly having no want of either: Cloaths are the badge of &s;inne, and the more variety of fa&s;hions is but the greater abu&s;e of the Creature, the bea&s;ts of the forre&s;t there doe &s;erve to furni&s;h them at any time, when they plea&s;e: fi&s;h and fle&s;h they have in greate abundance which they both roa&s;t and boyle.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="29"> They are indeed not &s;erved in di&s;hes of plate with variety of Sauces of procure appetite, that needs not there. The rarity of the aire begot by the me|dicinable quality of the &s;weete herbes of the Country, alwayes procures good &s;tomakes to the inha|bitants.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs commend them in this particular, that though they buy many commodities of our Nation, yet they keepe but fewe, and tho&s;e of &s;peciall u&s;e.</P>
<P>They love not to bee cumbered with many uten|&s;illes, and although every proprietor knowes his ownes, yet all things (&s;o long as they will la&s;t,) are u&s;ed in common among&s;t them: A bi&s;ket cake given to one; that one breakes it equally into &s;o many parts, as there be per&s;ons in his company, and di&s;tributes it. Platoes Commonwealth is &s;o much practi&s;ed by the&s;e people.</P>
<P>According to humane rea&s;on guided onely by the light of nature, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They leade a happy life, being voyd of care.</NOTE> the&s;e people leades the more hap|py and freer life, being voyde of care, which torments the mindes of &s;o many Chri&s;tians: They are not de|lighted in baubles, but in u&s;efull things.</P>
<P>Their naturall drinke is of the Cri&s;tall fountaine; and this they take up in their hands, by joyning them clo&s;e together. They take up a great quantity at a time, and drinke at the wri&s;ts, It was rhe &s;ight of &s;uch a feate, which made Diogenes hurle away his di&s;he, and like one that would have this principall confirmed. <HI>Natura paucis contentat,</HI> u&s;e a di&s;h no more.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="30"> I have ob&s;erved that they will not be troubled with &s;uperfluous commodities. Such things as they finde, they are taught by nece&s;&s;ity to make u&s;e of. they will make choi&s;e of; and &s;eeke to purcha&s;e with indu&s;try &s;o that in re&s;pect, that their life is &s;o voyd of care, <NOTE PLACE="marg">They make u&s;e of ordi|nary things, one of an|others as common.</NOTE> and they are &s;o loving al&s;o that they make u&s;e of tho&s;e things they enjoy (the wife onely excepted) as common goods, and are therein, &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate that rather than one &s;hould &s;tarve through want they would &s;tarve all, thus doe they pa&s;&s;e away they time merrily, not regarding our pompe (which they &s;ee dayly before their faces) but are better con|tent with their owne, which &s;ome men e&s;teeme &s;o meanely of.</P>
<P>They may be rather accompted to live richly, wanting nothing that is needefull; and to be commen|ded for leading a contented life, the younger being ruled by the Elder, and the Elder ruled by the Powahs, and the Powahs are ruled by the Devill, and then you may imagin what good rule is like to be among&s;t them.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. X.</HI> Of the Great Lake of Erocoi&s;e in Nevv England, and the commodities thereof.</HEAD>
<P>WE&s;twards from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;ets bay (which lyeth in 42. Degrees and 30. Minutes of Northerne latitude) is &s;cituated a very &s;pa|cious Lake (called of the Natives the Lake of Erocoi&s;e) which is farre more excellent, then the Lake of Ge|nezereth in the Country of Pale&s;tina, both in re&s;pect of the greatnes and properties thereof; and likewi&s;e of the manifould commodities it yealdeth: the circum|ference of which Lake is reputed to be 240. miles at the lea&s;t: and it is di&s;tant from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;ets bay 300. miles, or there abouts: wherein are very many faire I&s;lands, where innumerable flocks of &s;everall &s;orts of Fowle doe breede, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowle innu|merable.</NOTE> Swannes, Gee&s;e, Ducks, Widgines, Teales, and other water Fowle.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="49"> There are al&s;o more abundance of Beavers, Deare, and Turkies breed about the parts of that lake, then in any place in all the Country of New England; and al&s;o &s;uch multitudes of fi&s;h, (which is a great part of the foode, that the Beavers live upon,)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Multitudes of Fi&s;h.</NOTE> that it is a thing to be admired at: So that about this Lake, is the prin|cipall&s;t place for a plantation in all New Canaan, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The prime place of New Canaan.</NOTE> both for plea&s;ure and proffit.</P>
<P>Here may very many brave Townes and Citties be erected which may have intercour&s;e one with an|other by water, very commodiou&s;ly: and it is of many men of good judgement, accounted the prime &s;eate for the Metropolis of New Canaan, From this Lake Northwards is derived the famous River of Canada, (&s;o named of Mon&s;ier de Cane a French Lord, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Canada, &s;o named of Mon&s;ier de Cane.</NOTE> that fir&s;t planted a Colony of French in America, there called Nova Francia, from whence Captaine Kerke of late, by taking that plantation, brought home in one &s;hipp (as a Seaman of his Company, reported in my hearing) 25000. Beaver &s;kinnes.</P>
<P>And from this Lake Southwards, trends that good|ly River called of the Natives Patomack,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Patomack.</NOTE> which di&s;|chardgeth her&s;elfe in the parts of Virginea, from whence it is navigable by &s;hipping of great Burthen up to the Falls (which lieth in 41. Degrees, and a halfe of North latitude:) and from the Lake downe to the Falls by a faire current. This River is navi|gable for ve&s;&s;els of good Burthen; and thus much hath often bin related by the Natives, and is of late found to be certaine.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="50"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Great heards of Beasts as bigg as Cowes</NOTE>They have al&s;o made de&s;cription of great heards of well growne bea&s;ts, that live about the parts of this Lake, &s;uch as the Chri&s;tian world (untill this di&s;covery) hath not bin made acquainted with. The&s;e bea&s;ts are of the bigne&s;&s;e of a Cowe, their Fle&s;h being very good foode, their hides good lether, their fleeces very u&s;e|full, being a kinde of wolle, as fine almo&s;t as the wolle of the Beaver, and the Salvages doe make gar|ments thereof.</P>
<P>It is tenne yeares &s;ince fir&s;t the relation of the&s;e things came to the eares of the Engli&s;h: at which time wee were but &s;lender proficients in the language of the Natives, and they, (which now have attained to more perfection of Engli&s;h, could not then make us rightly apprehend their meaninge.</P>
<P>Wee &s;uppo&s;ed, when they &s;pake of Bea&s;ts there|abouts as high as men, they have made report of men all over hairy like Beavers, in &s;o much as we que&s;tio|ned them, whether they eate of the Beavers, to which they replyed Matta, (noe) &s;aying they were almo&s;t Beavers Brothers. This relation at that time wee concluded to be fruitles, which &s;ince, time hath made more apparent.</P>
<P>About the parts of this Lake may be made a very greate Commodity by the trade of furres, to inrich tho&s;e that &s;hall plant there; a more compleat di&s;co|very of tho&s;e parts: is (to my knowleadge) under|taken by Henry Io&s;eline E&s;quier &s;onne of Sir Thomas Io&s;eline of Kent Knight, by the approbation and ap|pointement of that Heroick and very good Com|mon wealths man Captaine Iohn Ma&s;on E&s;quier, a

<P>It is well knowne, they aime at that place, and have a po&s;&s;ibility to attaine unto the end of their de|&s;ires therein, by meanes, if the River of Mohegan, which of the Engli&s;h is named Hud&s;ons River (where the Dutch have &s;etled: to well fortified plantations al|ready. If that River be derived from the Lake as our Country man in his pro&s;pect affirmes it to be, and if they get and fortifie this place al&s;o, they will gleane away the be&s;t of the Beaver both from the French and Engli&s;h, who have hitherto lived wholely by it, and very many old planters have gained good e&s;tates out of &s;mall beginnings by meanes thereof.</P>
<P>And it is well knowne to &s;ome of our Nation that have lived in the Dutch plantation:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutch have a great trade of Bea|ver in Hud|&s;ons River.</NOTE> that the Dutch have gained by Beaver 20000. pound a yeare.</P>
<P>The Salvages make report of 3. great Rivers that i&s;&s;ue out or this Lake 2. of which are to us knowne, the one to be Patomack, the other Canada, and why may not the third be found there likewi&s;e, which they de&s;cribe to trend we&s;tward, which is conceaved to di&s;|charge her&s;elfe into the South Sea. The Salvages affirme that they have &s;eene &s;hipps in this Lake with 4. Ma&s;ts which have taken from thence for their la|dinge earth? that is conjectured to be &s;ome minerall &s;tuffe.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="51"> There is probability enough for this, and it may well be thought, that &s;o great a confluxe of waters as are there gathered together, mu&s;t be vented by &s;ome great Rivers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pa&s;&s;age to the East-Indies.</NOTE> and that if the third River (which th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> have made mention of) proove to be true as the other two have done: there is no doubt but that the pa&s;&s;age to the Ea&s;t India, may be obtained, without any &s;uch daingerous and fruitle&s;&s;e inque&s;t by the Norwe&s;t, as hetherto hath bin endeavoured: And there is no Traveller of any re&s;onable capacity, but will graunt, that about this Lake, mu&s;t be innumerable &s;pringes, and by that meanes many fruitfull, and plea&s;ant pa&s;tures all about it, It hath bin ob&s;erved that the in|land part (witnes Neepnet) are more plea&s;ant and fer|tile then the borders of the Sea coa&s;te.

<P>Ad therefore it would be adjudged an irrepa|rable over&s;ight to protract time, and &s;uffer the Dutch (who are but intruders upon his Maje&s;ties mo&s;t hope|full Country of New England) to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them&s;elves of that &s;o ple&s;ant and commodious Country of Ero|coi&s;e before us: being (as appeareth) the principall part of all New Canaan for plantation, and not el&s;e|where to be paralelld in all the knowne world.</P>

<P>Oedipus is generally receaved for the ab&s;olute reader of riddles who is invoaked: Silla and Caribdis are two dangerous places for &s;eamen to incounter, neere unto vennice, &amp; have bin by poets formerly re|&s;embled to man and wife. The like licence the author challenged for a paire of his nomination, the one la|menting for the lo&s;&s;e of the other as Niobe for her children. Amphitrite is an arme of the Sea, by which the newes was carried up and downe, of a rich widow, now to be tane up or laid downe.

Many aimed at this marke; but hee that played Proteus be&s;t and could comply with her humor mu&s;t be the man, that would carry her, &amp; hee had need have Samp&s;ons &s;trenght to deale with a Dal|lila: and as much patience as Iob that &s;hould come there, for a thing that I did ob&s;erve in the life time of the former.</P>

<P><PB N="138" REF="70"> Many threatening &s;peeches were given out both again&s;t his per&s;on, and his Habitation, which they divulged &s;hould be con&s;umed with fire: And taking advantage of the time when his company (which &s;ee|med little to regard, theire threats) were gone up into the Inlands, to trade with the Salvages for Beaver.</P>
<P>They &s;et upon my hone&s;t ho&s;t at a place, called We&s;&s;agu&s;cus, where (by accident) they found him.

<P>It appeares, they were like beares whelpes in for|mer time, when mine ho&s;ts plantation was of as much &s;trength as theirs, but now (theirs being &s;tronger,) they (like overgrowne beares) &s;eemed mon&s;terous.

<HEAD>THE ILLVSTRATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>NOw to illu&s;trate this Poem, and make the &s;ence more plaine, it is to be con&s;idered that the Per|&s;ons at Ma-re-Mount were &s;eaven, and they had &s;ea|ven heads and 14. feete, the&s;e were accounted Hi|dra with the &s;eaven heads; and the Maypole with the Hornes nailed neere the topp, was the forked tayle of this &s;uppo&s;ed Mon&s;ter, which they (for want of &s;kill) impo&s;ed: yet feared in time (if they hindred not mine Ho&s;t) hee would hinder the benefit of their Beaver trade, as hee had done (by meanes of this helpe) in Kyny back river finely, ere they were a wares; who comming too late, were much di&s;maide to finde that mine Ho&s;t his boate had gleaned away all before they came; which Beaver is a fitt companion for Scarlett: and I beleeve that Ia&s;ons golden Fleece was either the &s;ame, or &s;ome other Fleece not of &s;o much value.</P>
<P>This action bred a kinde of hart burning in the Plimmouth Planters who after, &s;ought occa&s;ion a|gain&s;t mine Ho&s;t to overthrowe his undertakings, and to de&s;troy his Plantation, whome they ac|coumpted a maine enemy to theire Church and State.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="76"> Now when they had begunne with him, they thought be&s;t to proceede: for a&s;much as they thought them&s;elves farre enough from any controule of Iu|&s;tice; and therefore re&s;olved to be their owne carvers: (and the father, becau&s;e they pre&s;umed upon &s;ome incouragement they had from the favourites of their Sect in England:) and with fire and &s;word nine in number pur&s;ued mine Ho&s;t; who had e&s;caped theire hand sin &s;corne of what they intended, and betooke him to his habitation in a night of great thunder and lightening, when they dur&s;t not follow him, as har|dy, as the&s;e nine worthies &s;eemed to be.</P>
<P>It was in the Moneth of Iune, that the&s;e Mar|&s;halli&s;ts had appointed to goe about this mi&s;cheifous project, and deale &s;o crabbidly with mine Ho&s;t.</P>
<P>After a parly, hee capitulated with them about the quarter, they proffered him, if hee would con|&s;ent to goe for England, there to an&s;were (as they pretended) &s;ome thing they could object again&s;t him principall to the generall: But what it would be hee cared not, neither was it any thing materiall.</P>
<P>Yet when quarter was agreed upon, they con|trary wi&s;e, abu&s;ed him, and carried him to theire towne of Plimmouth, where (if they had thought hee dur&s;t have gone to England) rather then they would have bin any more affronted by him, they would have di&s;patched him, as Captaine Shrimp in a rage, profe&s;t that hee would doe with his Pi&s;toll as mine Ho&s;t &s;hould &s;et his foote into the boate. How|&s;oever the cheife Elders voyce in that place was more powerfull than any of the re&s;t; who concluded
<PB N="151" REF="76">to &s;end mine Ho&s;t without any other thing to be done to him. And this being the finall agreement, (con|trary to Shrimpe and others,) the nine Worthies had a great Fea&s;t made, and the furmity po t was provided, for the boats gang by no allowance: and all manner of pa&s;time.</P>
<P>Captaine Shrimpe was &s;o overjoyed in the per|formance of this exployt; that they had, at that time, extraordinary merriment; a thing not u&s;uall among&s;t tho&s;e pre&s;i&s;ians) and when the winde &s;erved, they tooke mine Ho&s;t into their Shallop; hoy&s;ed Saile, and carried him to the Northen parts; where they left him upon a I&s;land.</P>

<P>THe Church of Plimmouth having due regard to the weale publike, and the Brethren, that were to come over; and knowing that they would be bu&s;i|ly imployed to make provi&s;ion for the cure of Soules, and therefore might neglect the body for that time: did hold them&s;elves to be in duety bound, to make &s;earch for a fitting man that might be able, (if &s;o neede requir'd) to take the chardge upon him in that place of imployment:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Councell called.</NOTE> and therefore called a Coun|fell of the whole Synagoge: among&s;t which company they cho&s;e out a man, that long time had bin nur&s;t up in the tender bo&s;ome of the Church: one that had
<PB N="152" REF="77">&s;peciall gifts: hee could wright and reade, nay more: hee had tane the oath of abjuration, which is a &s;pe|ciall &s;tepp, yea and a maine degree unto perferment, Him they weane: and out of Phaos boxe fitt him with &s;peciall guifts of no le&s;&s;e worth: they &s;tile him Doctor and forth they &s;end him to gaine imployement and o|pinion.</P>
<P>What luck is it I cannot hit on his name: but I will give you him by a periphra&s;is, that you may know him when you meete him next.</P>
<P>Hee was borne at Wrington in the County of Somer&s;et, where hee was bred a Butcher. Hee weares a longe beard, and a Garment like the Greeke that beggd in Pauls Church. This new made Do|ctor comes to Salem to congratulate: where hee findes &s;ome are newly come from Sea, and ill at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Hee takes the patient, and the urinall: vies the State there: findes the Cra&s;is Syptomes, and the at|tomi natantes: and tells the patient that his di&s;ea&s;e was winde, which hee had tane by gapeing, fea&s;ting, o|ver board at Sea, but hee would quickly ea&s;e him of that greife, and quite expell the winde. And this hee did performe, with his gifts hee had: and then hee handled the patient &s;o hand&s;omely, that hee ea|&s;ed him of all the winde, hee had in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>And yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if hee were made a fitting Plant for Heaven.</P>
<P>How hee went to worke with his gifts is a que&s;tion: yet hee did a great cure for Captaine Littleworth, hee cured him of a di&s;ea&s;e called a wife: and yet I hope this man may be forgiven, if &s;hee were made a fitting plant for heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="77"> By this meanes hee was allowed 4. p. a moneth, and the chirgeons che&s;t, and made Phi&s;ition gene|rall of Salem: where hee exerci&s;ed his gifts &s;o well, that of full 42. that there hee tooke to cure, there is not one has more cau&s;e to complaine, or can &s;ay black's his eie. This &s;aved Captaine Littleworths credit, that had truck'd away the vittels: though it brought forth a &s;candall on the Country by it, and then I hope this man may be forgiven, if they were all made fitting plants for Heaven.</P>
<P>But in mine opinion, hee de&s;erves to be &s;et upon a palfrey, and lead up and downe in triumph throw new Canaan, with a coller of Iurdans about his neck, as was one of like de&s;ert in Richard the &s;econds time through the &s;treets of London, that men might know where to finde a Quack&s;aluer.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXVII.</HI> Of the practi&s;e of their Church.</HEAD>
<P>THe Church of the Seperati&s;ts, is governed by Pa&s;tors, Elders, and Deacons, and there is not

<PB N="173" REF="87">any of the&s;e (thouh hee be but a Cow keeper) but is allowed to exerci&s;e his guifts, in the publik a&s;&s;embly on the Lords day; &s;o as hee doe not make u&s;e of any notes for the helpe of his memory: for &s;uch things they &s;ay &s;mell of Lampe oyle, and there mu&s;t be no &s;uch un&s;avery perfume admitted, to come into the congregation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are all publike preachers. There is among&s;t the&s;e people a Deakone&s;&s;e made of the &s;i&s;ters, that u&s;es her guifts at home in an a&s;&s;embly of her &s;exe, by way of repetition, or exhortation: &s;uch is their practi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Pa&s;tor (before hee is allowed of) mu&s;t di&s;|claime his former calling to the Mini&s;try, as hereticall; and take a new calling after their fanta&s;ticall inven|tions: and then hee is admitted to bee their Pa&s;tor.</P>
<P>The manner of di&s;claimeing is, to renounce his calling with bitter execrations, for the time that hee hath heretofore lived in it: and after his new e|lection, there is great joy conceaved at his com|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>And theire Pa&s;tors have this preheminence above the Civile Magi&s;trate: Hee mu&s;t fir&s;t con|&s;ider of the complaint, made again&s;t a mem|ber: and if hee be di&s;po&s;ed to give the partie complained of, an admonition, there is no more to be &s;aid: if not; Hee delivers him over to the Magi&s;trate to deale with him, in a cour&s;e of Iu&s;tice, according to theire practi&s;e, in ca&s;es of that na|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="88"> Of the&s;e pa&s;tors I have not knowne many: &s;ome I have ob&s;erved; together with theire carriage in New Canaan: and can informe you what opinion hath bin conceaved of theire conditions, in the perti|culer. There is one who (as they give it out there, that thinke they &s;peake it to advaunce his worth) has bin expected to exerci&s;e his gifts in an a&s;&s;em|bly, that &s;tayed his comming, (in the midde&s;t of his Iorney) falls into a fitt (which they terme a zealous meditation) and was 4. miles pa&s;t the place appointed, before hee came to him &s;elfe, or did remember where abouts hee went. And how much the&s;e things are dif|ferent from the actions of mazed men, I leave to any indifferent man to judge: and if I &s;hould &s;ay, they are all much alike, they that have &s;eene and heard, what I have done will not condemme mee altogether.</P>
<P>Now, for as much as by the practi&s;e of theire Church every Elder or Deacon may preach: it is not ami&s;&s;e to di&s;cover their practi&s;e in that perticuler, be|fore I part with them.</P>
<P>It has bin an old &s;aying, and a true, what is bred in the bone, will not out of the fle&s;h, nor the &s;tepping into the pulpit that can make the per&s;on fitt for the imployment. The unfitnes of the per&s;on undertaking to be the Me&s;&s;enger, has brought a blemi&s;h upon the me&s;&s;ages,

<P>But what was the i&s;&s;ue? Hee behaved him&s;elfe &s;o

<P>Socrates &s;ayes, <HI>loquere ut te videam.</HI> If a man ob|&s;erve the&s;e people in the exerci&s;e of their gifts, hee may thereby di&s;cerne the tincture of their proper cal|ling, the a&s;&s;es eares will peepe through the lyons hide. I am &s;orry they cannot di&s;cerne their owne infirmities I will deale fairely with them; for I will draw their pi|ctures cap a pe, that you may di&s;cerne them plainely from head to foote in their po&s;tures that &s;o much be|witch (as I may &s;peake with mode&s;ty,) the&s;e illiterate people to be &s;o fanta&s;ticall, to take Ionas ta&s;ke upon them without &s;ufficient warrant.</P>
<P>One &s;teps up like the Mini&s;ter of Iu&s;tice with the ballance onely, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Grocer.</NOTE> not the &s;word for feare of affrighting his auditory. Hee poynts at a text, and handles it as e|venly as hee can; and teaches the auditory, that the thing hee has to deliver; mu&s;t be well waied, for it is a very pretious thing, yet much more pretious then gold, or pearle: and hee will teach them the meanes how to way things of that excellent worth: that a man would &s;uppo&s;e, hee, and his auditory were to part &s;takes by the &s;cale; and the like di&s;tribution they have u&s;ed about a bag pudding.</P>
<P>Another (of a more cutting di&s;po&s;ition) &s;teps in his &s;teed; and hee takes a text,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">A taylor.</NOTE> which hee devides into many parts: (to &s;peake truly) as many as hee li&s;t. The fag end of it hee pares away, as a &s;uperfluous remnant.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="89"> Hee puts his auditory in comfort, that hee will make a garment for them: and teach them how they &s;hall put it on; and incourages them to be in love with it, for it is of &s;uch a fa&s;hion as doth be&s;t become a Chri|&s;tian man. Hee will a&s;&s;uer them that it &s;hall be armor of proffe again&s;t all a&s;&s;aults of Satan. This garment (&s;ayes hee) is not compo&s;ed as the garments made by a carnall man, that are &s;owed with a hot needle, and a burning thread; but it is a garment that &s;hall out la&s;t all the garments: and (if they will make u&s;e of it, as hee &s;hall direct them) they &s;hall be able (like &s;aint George) to terrifie the greate Dragon error; and defend truth which error with her wide chaps, would devoure: who&s;e mouth &s;hall be filled with the &s;hredds, and parings, which hee continually gapes for under the cutting bourd.</P>
<P>A third, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Tapster.</NOTE> hee &s;upplies the rome: and in the exerci&s;e of his guifts begins with a text that is drawne out of a fountaine, that has in it no dreggs of popery. This &s;hall proove unto you (&s;ays hee) the Cup of repentance; it is not like unto the Cup of the Whore of Babilon, who will make men drunk with the dreggs thereof: It is filled up to the brim with comfortable joyce, and will proove a cordiall, a comfortable cordiall to a &s;ick &s;oule, (&s;ayes hee,) And &s;o hee handles the matter as if hee dealt by the pinte, and the quarte with Nic and Froth.</P>
<P>An other (a very learned man indeed) goes an|other way to worke with his auditory;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Cobler.</NOTE> and exhorts them to walke upright, in the way of their calling, and not (like carnall men) tread awry. And if they &s;hould

<P>But &s;o to handle the matter, that they may be found to wax better and better, and then they &s;hall be doublely rewarded for theire worke: and &s;o clo&s;es up the matter in a comfortable manner.</P>
<P>But &s;tay: Here is one &s;tept up in ha&s;te, and (being not minded to hold his auditory in expecta|tion of any long di&s;cour&s;e,) hee takes a text; and (for brevities &s;ake,) divides it into one part: and then runnes &s;o fa&s;t a fore with the matter, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A very pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">|rick.</NOTE> that his audito|ry cannot follow him.

<P>Well, if you marke it, the&s;e are &s;peciall gifts in|deede: which the vulgar people are &s;o taken with, that there is no per&s;wading them that it is &s;o ridiculous.</P>

<PB N="181" REF="91">as it &s;tood now. They could debate upon it; and e&s;pe|cially upon two difficult points, whereof one mu&s;t be concluded upon.

<P>So that it &s;eemes (by theire di&s;cour&s;e about the matter) they &s;tood betwixt Hawke and Bu&s;&s;ard: and could not tell which hand to incline unto. They had &s;ounded him &s;ecretly: hee was content with it, goe which way it would. Nay &s;hackles him&s;elfe, (who was imployed in the burning of the how&s;e, and therefore feared to be caught in England) and others were &s;o for|ward in putting mine Ho&s;t <HI>in &s;tatu quo prius,</HI> after they had found their error, (which was &s;o apparent that Luceus eies would have &s;erved to have found it out in le&s;&s;e time) that they would contribute 40. &s;hillings a peece towards it; and affirmed, that every man accor|ding to his ability that had a hand in this black de&s;igne &s;hould be taxed to a Contribution in like nature: it would be done exactly.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XXX.</HI> Of Sir Christopher Cardiner Knight, and hovv hee &s;pedd among&s;t the Seperati&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>SIr Chri&s;topher Gardiner, (a Knight, that had bin a traveller, both by Sea and Land; a good judicious gentleman in the Mathematticke, and other Sciences u&s;efull for Plantations Kimi&s;try, &amp;c. and al&s;o being a practicall Enginer) came into tho&s;e parts, intending di&s;covery.</P>
<P>But the Seperati&s;ts love not tho&s;e good parts, when they proceede from a carnall man (as they call every good Prote&s;tant,) in &s;horte time had found the meanes to pick a quarrell with him. The meanes is, that they pur&s;ue to obtaine what they aime at: the word is there the meanes.</P>
<P>So that when they finde any man like to proove an enemy to their Church, and &s;tate, then &s;traight
<PB N="183" REF="92">the meanes mu&s;t be u&s;ed for defence. The fir&s;t pre|cept in their Politiques is, to defame the man at whom they aime. and then hee is a holy I&s;raelite in their opi|nions, who can &s;pread that fame brode&s;t, like butter upon a loafe: no matter how thin; it will &s;erve for a vaile: and then this man (who they have thus depra|ved) is a &s;potted uncleane leaper: hee mu&s;t out, lea&s;t hee pollute the Land, and them that are cleane.</P>
<P>If this be one of their guifts, then Machevill had as good gifts as they. Let them raife a &s;candall on any, though never &s;o innocent; yet they kow it is never wiped cleane out: the &s;taind marks remaines: which hath bin well ob&s;erved by one, in the&s;e words of his:
<Q><L><HI>Stick Candles gain&s;t a Virgin walls white back:</HI></L>
<L><HI>If they'l not burne yet at the least they'l black.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And thus they dealt with Sir Chri&s;topher: and plot|ted by all the wayes, and meanes they could, to over|throw his undertakings in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>And therefore I cannot chu&s;e, but conclude, that the&s;e Seperati&s;ts have &s;peciall gifts: for they are given to envy, and mallice extremely.</P>
<P>The knowledge of their defamacion could not plea&s;e the gentleman well, when it came to his eare, which would cau&s;e him to make &s;ome reply, (as they &s;uppo&s;ed) to take exceptions at, as they did again&s;t Faire cloath: &amp; this would be a meanes, they thought, to blow the coale, and &s;o to kindle a brand that might fire him out of the Country too, and &s;end him after mine Ho&s;t of Ma-re-Mount.</P>
<P>They take occa&s;ion (&s;ome of them) to come to his how&s;e when hee was gone up into the Country: and
<PB N="184" REF="93">finding hee was from home) &s;o went to worke, that they left him neither how&s;e, nor habitation, nor &s;er|vant, nor any thing to help him, if hee &s;hould retorne: but of that they had noe hope (as they gave it out) for hee was gone (as they affirmed) to leade a Salvage life; and for that cau&s;e tooke no company with him: and they, having con&s;idered of the matter, thought it not fit that any &s;uch man &s;hould live in &s;o remoate a place, within the Compas of their patent. So they fired the place; and carried away the per&s;ons, and goods.</P>
<P>Sir Chri&s;topher was gone with a guide (a Salvage) into the in land parts for di&s;covery: but, before hee was returned, hee met with a Salvage that told the guide, Sir Chri&s;topher would be killed: Ma&s;ter Tem|perwell (who had now found out matter again&s;t him) would have him dead, or alive. This hee related; and would have the gentleman not to goe to the place ap|pointed, becau&s;e of the danger, that was &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P>But Sir Chri&s;topher was nothing di&s;maid: hee would on, what&s;oever come of it; and &s;o met with the Salvages: and betweene them was a terrible &s;ker|mi&s;h: But they had the wor&s;t of it, and hee &s;caped well enough.</P>
<P>The guide was glad of it, and learnd of his fel|lowes that they were promi&s;ed a great reward, for what they &s;hould doe in this imployment.</P>
<P>Which thing (when Sir Chri&s;topher under&s;tood,) hee gave thanks to God; and after (upon this occa&s;ion, to &s;ollace him&s;elfe) in his table booke, hee compo&s;ed this &s;onnet, which I have here in&s;erted for a memo|riall.</P>

Yet hee thought hee would make one good meale, before hee died: like the Colony &s;ervant in Virginea, that before hee &s;hould goe to the gallowes) called to his wife to &s;et on the loblolly pot, and let him have one good meale before hee went; who had committed a petty crime, that in tho&s;e dayes, was made a cappitall offence.</P>
<P>And now mine Ho&s;t being merrily di&s;po&s;ed, on went the peeces of porke, where with hee fea&s;ted his body, and cheri&s;hed the poore Sailers: and got out of them what M^r. Wethercock, their Ma&s;ter purpo&s;ed to doe with him that hee had no more provi&s;ion: &amp; along they &s;ailed from place to place, from Iland to Iland, in a pittifull wether beaten &s;hip; where mine Ho&s;t was in more dainger (without all que&s;tion) then Ionas, when hee was in the Whales belly; and it was the great mer|cy of God that they had not all peri&s;hed. Vittelled they were but for a moneth when they wayd Ancor, and left the fir&s;t port.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="94"> They were a pray for the enemy for want of powther, if they had met them: be&s;ides the ve&s;&s;ell was a very &s;lugg, and &s;o un&s;erviceable, that the Ma&s;ter called a coun&s;ell of all the company in generall, to have theire opinions, which way to goe, and how to beare the helme, who all under their hand affirmed the &s;hipp to be un&s;erviceable: &s;o that in fine the Ma&s;ter, and men, and all were at their wits end about it: yet they im|ployed the Carpenters to &s;earch, and caulke her &s;ides, and doe theire be&s;t whiles they were in her. Nine moneths they made a &s;hifte to u&s;e her, and &s;hifted for &s;upply of vittells at all the I&s;lands they touched at; though it were &s;o poorely, that all tho&s;e helpes, and the &s;hort allowance of a bi&s;ket a day, and a few Lymons taken in at the Canaries, &s;erved but to bring the ve&s;&s;ell in view of the lands end.</P>
<P>They were in &s;uch a de&s;perat ca&s;e, that (if God in his greate mercy had not favoured them, and di&s;|po&s;ed the windes faire untill the ve&s;&s;ell was in Plim|mouth roade,) they had without que&s;tion peri&s;hed; for when they let drop an Anchor, neere the I&s;land of S. Michaels not one bit of foode left for all that &s;tarving allowance of this wretched wethercock; that if hee would have lanched out his beaver, might have bought more vittells in New England then he &amp; the whole &s;hip with the Cargazoun was worth, (as the pa&s;&s;ingers hee carried who vittelled them&s;elves affirmed,) But hee played the mi&s;erable wretch, &amp; had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his men with the contrary; who repented them of waying an|chor before they knew &s;o much.</P>
<P>Mine Ho&s;t of Ma-re-Mount (after hee had bin in
<PB N="188" REF="95">the Whales belly) was &s;et a &s;hore to &s;ee if hee would now play Ionas, &s;o metamorpho&s;ed with a longe voy|age, that hee looked like Lazarus in the painted cloath.</P>
<P>But mine Ho&s;t (after due con&s;ideration of the premi&s;&s;es) thought it fitter for him to play Ionas in this kinde, then for the Seperati&s;ts to play Ionas in that kinde as they doe. Hee therefore bid Wethercock tell the Seperati&s;ts, that they would be made in due time to repent tho&s;e malitious practi&s;es, and &s;o would hee too; for hee was a Seperati&s;t among&s;t the Sepera|ti&s;ts as farre as his wit would give him leave; though when hee came in Company of ba&s;ket makers, hee would doe his indevoure to make them pinne the ba&s;ket, if hee could, as I have &s;eene him. And now mine Ho&s;t being merrily di&s;po&s;ed, haveing pa&s;t many perillous adventures in that de&s;perat Whales belly, be|ganne in a po&s;ture like Ionas, and cryed Repent you cruell Seperati&s;ts repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouch&s;afe to thunder, Charter and the King|dome of the Seperati&s;ts will fall a &s;under: Repent you cruell Schi&s;maticks repent. And in that po&s;ture hee greeted them by letters retorned into new Canaan; and ever (as opportunity was fitted for the purpo&s;e) he was both heard &amp;c &s;eene in the po&s;ture of Ionas again&s;t the~ crying repent you cruel Seperati&s;ts, repent, there are as yet but 40. dayes if Iove vouch&s;afe to thunder. The Charter and the Kingdome of the Seperati&s;ts will fall a &s;under: Repent you cruell Schi&s;maticks repent; If you will heare any more of this proclamation meete him at the next markettowne, for <HI>Cynthius aurem vellet.</HI></P>
