<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SAint <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> in the Province of
<HI>Guipo&s;coa,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> is a free Town, in man|ner of a Republick; &s;ubjected to the Crown <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> on Conditions approved on by the Kings of <HI>Spain:</HI> And in all their Writings, they &s;tyle it,</P>
<P><HI>The Most Noble and Most Loyal City of Saint</HI> Seba&s;tian.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Spain,</HI> have given them this Ti|tle for &s;ervices they did the Crown.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Guipo&s;coa</HI> enjoys great Frivi|ledges, and do not obey the Kings Orders, when that which is required of them, is contrary to<PB N="2" REF="5">the Priviledges and Liberties of the Province. Which is Governed thus,</P>
<P>Every Year there is a Convocation or A&s;&s;em|bly, whether every Town does &s;end their De|puties to Concert Affairs relating to their County or province. Their Meeting is in four different places by turns, and they are call'd.</P>
<P>Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian, Toloza, A&s;peytia</HI> and
<HI>A&s;coytia.</HI></P>
<P>The head or chief of &s;uch that are cho&s;en for the Governing this Province, is a Judge Call'd <HI>Cor|rigidor,</HI> who is as Lord
<HI>Lieutenant</HI> of a County, or <HI>Intendant</HI> of a Province. It's to him the King &s;ends his Orders to be Executed in the County. Be&s;ides this
<HI>Corrigidor,</HI> There is cho&s;en for the Governing the &s;aid Province a
<HI>Deputation</HI> (&s;o cal|led by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>) con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal re|pre&s;entatives of the &s;everal places in the &s;aid Pro|vince, who have Power of refu&s;ing the Kings Orders &s;erved to them by the
<HI>Corrigidor,</HI> if that any &s;uch Orders or Commi&s;&s;ion pre&s;ented them are again&s;t the Rights of the <HI>Deputation,</HI> or pla|ces whom they repre&s;ent; But if the Kings Com|mi&s;&s;ion or Orders to the
<HI>Corrigidor,</HI> does not con|tradict the Rights of the
<HI>Deputation,</HI> they let him put them in Execution to the full. For Ex|ample,</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5">When the King asks of the &s;aid province to &s;upply him with a certain number of Men, ei|ther Landmen, or Seamen; The
<HI>Corrigidor</HI> &s;erves the Kings Orders to the Province and acquaints the
<HI>Deputation:</HI> They tell him they are a free People, and that they cannot oblidge any Inha|bitant to leave his Family to &s;erve the King: But when they find that the demand is not again&s;t their Liberties and Rights, they are &s;o civil to give the King leave to order Drum to be beat, and they will not oppo&s;e it; otherwi&s;e they do as in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Corrigidor</HI> Duke <HI>Cor&s;ano</HI> a few years ago, who requiring of this province of
<HI>Guipo&s;coa,</HI> and in particular of the City of Saint
<HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> &s;ome things contrary to their Priviledg|es (which I &s;hall not mention) They pre&s;ent|ed their <HI>Leij Secundo,</HI> or Charter in one hand and a Sword in the other, with Orders to him in four hours to leave the Province, the Duke was fain to &s;cowr for it.</P>
<P>The Government of the City of Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> who&s;e Magi&s;trates are cho&s;en once a Year, about a week before
<HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> is thus.</P>
<P>There is about an hundred Electors, who mu&s;t be qualified as you'll hear hereafter (for no bo|dy can be of the Government of Saint
<HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI><PB N="2" REF="6"><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page"><PB N="3" REF="6"><GAP DESC="duplicate" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="4" REF="7">nor of the province, nor indeed of the lea&s;t Vil|lage, till he has proved his <HI>Higuidalquir, Viz.</HI> (That he is Noble).</P>
<P>Their Magi&s;trates are cho&s;en thus.</P>
<P>There is a great Silver Bowl, into which is put confu&s;edly all the Electors Names: The fir&s;t eight that a Boy (like one of our Blew Coat Boys) takes out, are tho&s;e who are to be <HI>Alcai|jde, Subalcaijde, Syndect,</HI> Magi&s;trates and Jurates for the following Year.</P>
<P>The&s;e eight Name every one of them, one to be <HI>Alcaijde</HI> and <HI>Subalcaijde,</HI> the fir&s;t two of the&s;e eight, the Boy takes out, are <HI>Alcaijd</HI> and <HI>Subalcaijde,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Alcaijde,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Subal|cajde,</HI> and &s;o after the &s;ame manner of the
<HI>Syn|dect</HI> and other Officers.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this fair way of choo&s;ing their Magi&s;trates, there is Faction and Intere&s;t made to get in their friends into the Magi&s;tracy, they are generally very poor, di&s;pi&s;ing Indu&s;try and Arts; and when they come to Govern or to be <HI>Alcaijde,</HI> have opportunities of exacting even up|on their own people as well as &s;trangers, and which they make no &s;cruple of doing in the face<PB N="5" REF="7">of the World. I could relate &s;everal particulars to my Knowledge, but that I &s;hould expo&s;e them too much: and indeed, it would hardly be be|lieved that &s;uch tricks and little things were pra|cti&s;ed in <HI>Spain,</HI> where every one from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, value them&s;elves on their Families, Nobility and
<HI>Punctilio's</HI> of Honour.</P>
<P>In order to be thus qualified to get into the Government (as I &s;aid before),</P>
<P>They mu&s;t be Noble.</P>
<P>Their Nobility is thus, not to have had any of their Kindred a
<HI>Jew, Moor, Turk,</HI> or <HI>Here|tick.</HI></P>
<P>And to prove this, the Per&s;on that would be of the Government, pre&s;ents a reque&s;t to the Pro|vince of <HI>Guipo&s;coa,</HI> in which is explained his in|tention, and asks to be a <HI>Cavallero Dillegenzero, Viz.</HI> That his Birth and E&s;tate may be enquired into, in order to his being made a Noble|man.</P>
<P>The Province or Town orders their <HI>Syndect,</HI> who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to enquire into his Family (and for which he has a Pi&s;tol a day) to go to<PB N="6" REF="8">the place of his Birth along with him, and there take both private, as well as publick informati|ons of his Family, which afterwards he reports to the Province or Magi&s;trates of the place, where &s;uch a one would be of the Government; if the report is allowed, the
<HI>Cavallero Dilligenzero,</HI> is declared Noble.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e qualifications already mentioned.</P>
<P>There is one yet very remarkable and with|out it, if they were de&s;cended from <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> or <HI>A|chilles</HI> Race, they cannot be Noble, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>If they live, or are to live in Town, they mu&s;t have a Hou&s;e of their own, or el&s;e they mu&s;t have Land enough in the Province where|on they have two Thou&s;and Apple-Trees, or whereon they may rai&s;e two Thou&s;and Apple-Trees, and then the <HI>Cavallero Dilligenzero,</HI> is ad|mitted and made Capable of being admitted into the Government. No Man can be Noble by his Wife, or by her E&s;tate:</P>
<P>The Town of Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> is &s;eated, as you &s;ee by the Draught, on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide, and at the bottom of a high Hill of Free&s;tone in a &s;quare form, the Town is hid by the Hill as you make
<PB N="7" REF="8">towards the Land and is not to be &s;een, till you are in the Road.</P>
<P>There are two Gates, that of the <HI>Peer,</HI> and the other that's called the <HI>Pa&s;&s;age Gate,</HI> from which, goes a Road to
<HI>Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> a Noble Harbour; There is a Horn work with a Ravelin before it that co|vers the <HI>Pa&s;&s;age Gate,</HI> and but very ordinary and in ill repair, and out of all due Propor|tion.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle upon the top of the Hill &s;tands prettily, a Noble Pro&s;pect from it all along that part of the <HI>Bay</HI> of
<HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> from <HI>Cape Martinchauco</HI> to <HI>Arka&s;on</HI> and
<HI>Cabritton</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> The going up, or acce&s;s to this Ca&s;tle is difficult, which adds to the &s;trength of it, and I think all that can be &s;aid ju&s;tly of this Ca&s;tle is this, and that is all Altho the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are extream Proud of it, and quote you <HI>Charlequin,</HI> who &s;aid in Prai&s;e of it (if you'll believe them) that if he &s;hould loo&s;e all <HI>Spain,</HI> and had only the Ca&s;tle of Saint
<HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> he would recover it.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle was blown up by the <HI>Maga&s;ines</HI> ta|ing fire, but is now rebuilt and in good repair; all the Water in the Ca&s;tle is rain Water, which is Conveyed into a Well by Leaden Pipes from<PB N="8" REF="9">the Roof of the Guard Room, and <HI>Barraques,</HI> which are indeed very fine and capable of Lodg|ing two Thou&s;and Men Conveniently.</P>
<P>The Garri&s;on at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts of a Sergeant and &s;ix Men, which by detachment from the main Guard (which does not con&s;i&s;t of above twelve, be&s;ides a Governour, Captain, Lieutenant and En&s;ign) is relieved every day by the like num|ber, and by &s;ometimes a le&s;&s;er. The Souldiers are all beggars, and if a &s;tranger refu&s;es to give them &s;omething, they contrive to do him mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>There are two Platforms mounted with Guns, I &s;uppo&s;e de&s;igned to &s;ecure the Harbour and Play on Ships that would force them&s;elves into the Road, they are too high to be of any u&s;e to them, as well as the Ca&s;tle for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mouth of the Harbour there is a Hill called Saint
<HI>Claire,</HI> where there was three months ago a <HI>Hermit</HI> of the order of Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> who tells twenty Legends and Stories, and helps to fill the Casks with Wine, as he mud live by begging, &s;o the Poor old fellow will be every day as drunk as a beggar; for this rea&s;on they &s;ay, they turned him out of his. Cell, but it's believed<PB N="9" REF="9">rather it was to make room for one that is now there, a Gentleman of a con&s;iderable E&s;tate in the Kingdom of <HI>Castile,</HI> for rea&s;ons, he has his E&s;tate Men from him, and is confined to this <HI>I&s;land</HI> as a <HI>Hermit,</HI> to beg his Bread for four|teen Years, and then returns to his E&s;tate again: The Church and Clergy enjoys his E&s;tate in the mean time.</P>
<P>All that Dye <HI>Hereticks</HI> are buried here; when the Corps is carried out of Town to be waft|ed over to this <HI>I&s;land</HI> to be Buried, the Mob of Men and Women follow In&s;ulting over the Corps, Crying aloud,
<HI>He goes to Hell.</HI> The <HI>Hermit</HI> has the benefit of the ground on his <HI>I&s;land</HI> and &s;ells it as he thinks fit.</P>
<P>To give the Clergy their due, they are not &s;o trouble&s;ome to &s;trangers when they are &s;ick and a dying, altho <HI>Hereticks,</HI> with their extream Unction and Wafers as in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The coming into the Road, and over the <HI>Bar</HI> of Saint
<HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> is difficult, unle&s;s with a leading Wind, a great Rock lies under Water in the middle of the <HI>Bar.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="10">But to run no hazard, the Pilots will force them|&s;elves on board of you, which is commendable e|nough if it was not on de&s;ign to impo&s;e upon you, and make one pay what they plea&s;e and no help for it, nor no Ju&s;tice done if you complain. The <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> and
<HI>Merchant</HI> &s;trangers re&s;iding at Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> have brought them to &s;ome bet|ter rea&s;on and to Compo&s;ition, but for all that, it is &s;till as they plea&s;e, every Fi&s;herman looks upon him&s;elf as good as <HI>Signior Alcaijde</HI> him&s;elf; So that a Man mu&s;t &s;it down under all affronts and hard&s;hips and be quiet.</P>
<P>Their way of living at Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian.</HI></P>
<P>People that are of the better &s;ort and di&s;tingui&s;h|able, after having enjoyed the Mu&s;ick of <HI>Serenading</HI> little before day, they get up and drink Chocolet, without which they would not &s;tir abroad if their hou&s;e was on fire, then they take, both Men and Women, a great deal of pains with their hair, dre&s;s them&s;elves and go to Church, they and their Prie&s;ts under&s;tand what they Pray to God for much alike, for not one of twenty of their Clergy under&s;tands <HI>Latin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">After Ma&s;s the Men go to the <HI>Peer,</HI> where they tarry till eleven of the Clock, then they go to the middle of the Town called the four <HI>Corners,</HI> where they &s;tay till twelve, after it has &s;truck, if it was to &s;ave the Town they would not &s;tay a minute longer, and oftentimes break off in the middle of a Story or &s;entence, to go home to their <HI>Olio.</HI> The fir&s;t thing pre&s;ented at their Tables is a Chocolet Cup of Soup, or the gravey of meat boiled and Bread crumbled into it, &s;erved upon Earthen Platters, then comes the Roa&s;t Meat, then the Boiled, and at la&s;t the de&s;ert.</P>
<P>They give this rea&s;on of bringing the Roa&s;t Meat before the Boiled (which &s;eems plau&s;ible e|nough) the be&s;t of the Boiled Meat &s;ay they is in the broth, and there is more &s;ub&s;tance and nouri&s;hment in the Roa&s;t than in the Boyled, for that rea&s;on, this would pa&s;s if they did not &s;poil their Roa&s;t Meat and Fowl by over-doing of them, and Roa&s;ting them dry as they do their Boiled Meat, by Boiling it to Pieces.</P>
<P>But mo&s;t People think it's rather in oppo&s;ition to the re&s;t of the World, for they &s;how it almo&s;t in every little thing el&s;e; Syder they have cheap, and abundance of &s;weet Apples very large all
<PB N="12" REF="11">round the Country. The Corn of the Country is
<HI>Indian</HI> Corn and no other, with Wheat they are &s;upplied from the
<HI>Sound</HI> and &s;ometimes from <HI>Bar|bary,</HI> and often from
<HI>England;</HI> They have been &s;o hard put to it this la&s;t Year, that they have been forced to make Bread of Che&s;nuts, which is the rea&s;on they are Prohibited to be Exported. They have extraordinary good Rabbits of
<HI>Na|var</HI> and Wild Fowl plenty, their Pidgeons are much e&s;teemed, and their red Partridge of <HI>Arra|gon,</HI> are excellent and large.</P>
<P>Fi&s;h they have plenty and of good &s;orts, if they'll be at the pains to catch it, and if the Sea, (which with a <HI>North-West</HI> blowing wind flyes high on the <HI>Bar,</HI> and even up almo&s;t to the top of the
<HI>I&s;land</HI> Saint <HI>Clair,</HI> about &s;ix hun|dred Foot) will permit; the Sea oftentimes in the Harbour flyes to the top of the Walls forty Foot high and more.</P>
<P>When the Fi&s;hermen come from Sea with their Boats, their Wives are &s;itting on die <HI>Peer</HI> with their Husbands Cloaks and long Spadas, or long Rapiers, the Husband walks in State into the Town, and his Wife carries the Basket of Fi&s;h on her head to the Market place and &s;ells them. Billing&s;-gate Language and Noi&s;e is nothing to<PB N="13" REF="11">what the Fi&s;her-Men and Apple-Women make at Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> they are always Quarrelling and will Cuff heartily, and will not be friends under a Week. Their common language is <HI>Ba&s;que,</HI> which is as much different from <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> as <HI>Welch</HI> from <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Their Hou&s;es are Lofty and Stately, only covered with Pan-tiles, and becau&s;e of great unexpected Squales of Wind which happen here often, they lay great &s;tones on the Pan-tiles to keep them fa&s;t, &s;ometimes both Stones and Pan-tiles are fetched down by Storms of Wind, and their &s;treets being narrow, it is dan|gerous then to walk the &s;treets. Their rooms are large, but only one Chimney in a Hou&s;e of five rooms of a floor, and four or five &s;tories high, and that at the top of the Hou&s;e. They live all Winter in the up|per Stories to enjoy the benefit of the Sun, and in the lower Rooms in Summer. It is very hot here, the re|flection of the Sun from the Ca&s;tle Hill on one hand, and from the Sand in the Vale on the other, is the cau&s;e that it is hotter here than in many places of a more <HI>Southern</HI> Latitude. Their Beds are finely Carved and Gilded, but very hard to lye on, their Curtains, are of Linnen Laced at every half yard broad, but not wide enough to draw round the Bed, they have few or no Gla&s;s Windows, only Latices, their Beds &s;tand all in <HI>Alcoves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="12">Merchant &s;trangers unle&s;s Married with a
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman, have not the Liberty to hire Hou&s;es, but mu&s;t get one of the Town to hire them, and live in it with him, and they generally go &s;nacks with the Merchants in their profits.</P>
<P>From Dinner they go to &s;leep till two or three, and then go out of Town between die <HI>Horn-Work</HI> and the <HI>Town Wall,</HI> there they tarry all the After|noon, either Playing, or looking on tho&s;e that play at Tennis and Ninepins: Their Tennis Court is in the open Air and rough Paved, yet they are very expert in to&s;&s;ing the Ball.</P>
<P>In the Winter they pa&s;s their time till eight of the Clock at Night in private Hou&s;es, or at an A&s;&s;em|bly, where every one that comes in, Pays &s;ix pence; he may either pick up a party to Play at Cards, or &s;it and &s;ee others Play, and Talk, and Call for three or four Gla&s;&s;es of Wine; if they &s;tay beyond eight, the Mayor &s;ends his <HI>Algo&s;ins,</HI> and makes Money of the Company, as well as of him that entertains them after &s;uch an hour. Sometimes the Clock &s;trikes eight when it is but &s;even, if the Mayor wants a little Money.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="12">The Men are very tight in their
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Garb, their long Spadas, their &s;ilk &s;tockings and &s;la&s;h'd &s;hoes; the Women mode&s;tly and odly attired, all of them go Vailed, their Vails very large, gathered at the bottom in &s;uch a manner, that as they walk their Vails &s;it as full blown about them as the Sails of a Ship before the Wind; their petticoats are proportionable, and the Ladies, who generally all &s;it on the ground or floor, have &s;uch an addre&s;s when they &s;it down to &s;ling their Petticoats out in a round, that mode&s;tly &s;peaking, they take, up more room than any Mil|&s;tone in <HI>England</HI> does in circumference, and the Wind gathered under their Coats by the turn they make, is &s;o long of getting out, that by degrees as their Coats fall, they find a cool bree&s;e that is very refre&s;hing to them in &s;o hot a Climate: They &s;el|dom &s;tir abroad, the better &s;ort but to Church, and even then without a great deal of Jealou&s;ie of an ill natur'd Husband; they have pretty Faces, black Eyes, and would look about them, as Women do in other Countreys if they dur&s;t.</P>
<P>The Prie&s;ts are the only happy Men that enjoy the Ladies Company; Who are about eighty in all, their revenue is but &s;mall, they live merry lives, eat and drink of the be&s;t, in private Hou&s;es, where they are
<PB N="16" REF="13">always welcome, few or none of them, but have three or four Children and no reflection on them.</P>
<P>When a Prie&s;t would lay with a Woman, he ob|&s;olves her from the great &s;cruple Women make of Whoredoms being a great &s;in, he tells her he'll take that &s;in to him&s;elf; as for the other &s;cruple that Wo|men have of loo&s;ing their reputation and &s;poiling their fortunes, there is no &s;uch thing among&s;t them, for if a Man gets a Woman with Child, that does not pa&s;s for a Pro&s;titute, he is only to keep the Child and give the Wench a Portion (if &s;he has nothing of her own) who Marries and is not a bit the wor&s;e looked upon.</P>
<P>Women have another advantage in this Coun|trey, for after they are Contracted and all mat|ters &s;ettled, and the day of Marriage agreed on; &s;he has the Liberty to de&s;ire her Bridegroom to come and &s;how him&s;elf a Man: and if &s;he does not find him to her &s;atisfaction the Contract is void, and &s;he's a good Maid &s;till.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="13">They bring up &s;ome of their Young Women to Play on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Harp, for which they let their Nails grow &s;o long that it looks &s;trange|ly.</P>
<P>They do not allow of any Bawdy Hou&s;es, but e|very &s;treet, in a dark Night, &s;erves their turn, and he mu&s;t look to him&s;elf that di&s;turbs them, or &s;poils &s;port.</P>
<P>Every Sunday and Holiday, the ordinary &s;ort of them have a Dance on the Market Place, thus,</P>
<P>There are three Drums and Pipes, the Drum Major who has the bige&s;t Drum, which is about the bigne&s;s of a childs Drum, is the common Hangman; there they whi&s;tle with one hand, and beat their Drums with the other, till there is a Ring made, when one of the nimble&s;t of the fellows goes into the middle of the Ring, a &s;hows his Activity, takes out of the Ring a Wench, &s;he her Mate, and &s;o it goes round; the fir&s;t fellow leads the brandle, and all Dance and &s;how their Parts for an hour. The Coopers, who are numerous here, on Saint <HI>Andrews-Day</HI> their Pa|tron, go a Maskquerading all Day, and Play twenty tricks ridiculous enough, and would not work that
<PB N="18" REF="14">day for any reward, but they make it up at other times, for they are at work before day.</P>
<P>The Country all round abounds with Oak, proper for the Staves, and Che&s;nut Trees, of which they make the Hoops, for Cask; there is al&s;o great Numbers of Cask made in the Country, and at <HI>Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and brought to Saint <HI>Scha&s;tian</HI> empty on Mules.</P>
<P>There is near to the Town the Convent of Saint <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> a Nunnery of Women, where there is to be &s;een the Corps of a Woman dean hun|dreds of years ago, her Arms, Legs and Face, ap|pers as full as if &s;he had been Buried but ye|&s;terday; &s;he looks Tawny, and I believe has been &s;erved <HI>Mummey</HI>-like; when they were digging the Foundation of this Mona&s;tery they found this Corps, which they pray to.</P>
<P>The chief Trade of the Town is Iron, Wine and Oyl.</P>
<P>Their Iron Mills are near to the Town, and their Iron Bars are brought to the Town on Hor&s;es or Mules, on Crook&s;addles to the publick
<HI>Maga&s;ine,</HI> which is under the Town, Hall, where<PB N="19" REF="14">con&s;tant attendance is given for receiving it out of the Country, and delivering and weighing it to the Buyer. Our Tin Men in <HI>Cornwall</HI> are here &s;upplyed with their &s;tamps, and other Uten&s;ils for the carrying on their work.</P>
<P>All other Merchandi&s;es, except Iron, are drawn on Sledges, by two Oxen, in and out of the Town.</P>
<P>They deal &s;omewhat in train Oyl and Whale|bone, they have &s;ome Ships that go to the <HI>North-ward</HI> a Whale fi&s;hing, be&s;ides they catch &s;ome in &s;ight of the Ca&s;tle; and in order to this, &s;ome Months in the Year, they hire a Man that looks out continually from the top of the Hill, betwixt Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> who when he &s;ees a Whale or Bottleno&s;e, makes a &s;ign to the Ca&s;tle, the Sentinal from the Ca&s;tle adverti&s;es, by his Bell, the Town, immediately the Fi&s;hermen upon that go forth to the Prey; There was a Botleno&s;e, about the bigne&s;s of that which was brought up to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> brought in to Saint
<HI>Se|ba&s;tian</HI> in <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, out of whom they got a great quantity of that which they call <HI>Sperma Ceti;</HI> the fle&s;h was boy led to Oyl.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="15">They have al&s;o &s;ome Trade to <HI>Newfound Land,</HI> but with that &s;ort of Fi&s;h (<HI>Cabelau</HI> they call it) they are better &s;upplyed from other Nations than by their own Ships.</P>
<P>The great quantity of <HI>Pilchards</HI> caught on the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Galicia,</HI> is a mighty help to this part of <HI>Spain,</HI> of which they are great <HI>Lovers,</HI> and are in more e&s;teem with them than
<HI>Herrings.</HI></P>
<P>But the more remarkable Trade of the Town at pre&s;ent, and that which brings mo&s;t Money to the Town, is the Wine Trade.</P>
<P>The late War with <HI>France,</HI> from whence we were &s;upplyed with their excellent <HI>Grave Medoc</HI> and <HI>Pontack</HI> Wines, occa&s;ioned our Parliament to put &s;uch a great Duty on <HI>French</HI> Wines, and o|ther Liquors of the Growth of <HI>France;</HI> that Mer|chants have looked out how to be &s;upplyed o|therwi&s;e, that they may pay ea&s;ier Duties; and luckily they have light upon a &s;pot of ground, Called the
<HI>Spani&s;h Navar,</HI> of which <HI>Panplone, Ab|litas</HI> and <HI>Villa Franka,</HI> are the chief Towns, that affords us as good Wines as any
<HI>French</HI> Wines; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of late both at Saint
<HI>Seba&s;tian, Pa&s;&s;age, Fonteravia</HI> and <HI>Guitaria,</HI> finding &s;uch a<PB N="21" REF="15">demand for Wines, and con&s;iderable profit by them, have improved their Vineyards to &s;o great a degree, both in quantity as well as quality of good Wines, that their improvement equals, if not exceeds that of <HI>Portugal;</HI> which before the War was not able to furni&s;h us with above three or four hundred Pipes in a Year, and now there is above ten Thou&s;and Pipes a Year Imported from thence, which appears from the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e Books.</P>
<P>This will not be allowed by &s;ome, but it is ve|ry true: one &s;hall fee at Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> Mules by hundreds Loaded with Wine in Hogskins, three skins upon a Mule containing ten Gallons each, come every day into Town (Sunday not excep|ted) all this is unloaded in the
<HI>Maga&s;ines</HI> and &s;or|ted, and next day put into Cask, the Mules car|ry away the empty skins into the Country for more.</P>
<P>This is not only done at Saint <HI>Seba&s;tian,</HI> but al&s;o at
<HI>Fonteravia, Pa&s;&s;age,</HI> and <HI>Guitaria,</HI> from the&s;e places they come to Saint <HI>Sebastian</HI> in <HI>Bar|ques,</HI> and <HI>Bargo Longos,</HI> (becau&s;e of the Conveni|ency of Sea Carriage) in Cask, and are Lodged in Merchants Cellers ready for the buyer.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="16">The truth of all this is &s;o well known in
<HI>England,</HI> from the care the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Cu&s;toms took, in &s;ending over two of their Officers to examin into the truth of it, and from &s;ome Tryals at the <HI>Exche|quer Bar,</HI> that it cannot be further que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, for all wines Ship'd off from Saint
<HI>Seba|&s;tian,</HI> the Ma&s;ters of Ships are obliged to take Cer|tificates from the Mayor and Con&s;ul, as a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony that their wines are of the Growth of <HI>Navar,</HI> in his Catholick Maje&s;ties Dominions, given under the great Seal of the</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;t Noble and Mo&s;t Loyal City of Saint</HI> Seba&s;tian.</P>
<P>And unde&s;igned by their Sworn Matter Cooper, <HI>Signior Nicola</HI> and his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, that the very Cask are made by them.</P>
