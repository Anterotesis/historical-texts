<HEAD>THE LIFE OF ABRAHAM ORTELL, COSMOGRAPHER TO PHILIP THE SECOND, LATE KING OF SPAINE, written fir&s;t in Latine by <HI>Francis Sweert</HI> of Antwerpe, his familiar <HI>and louing friend, and now tran&s;lated into Engli&s;h by</HI> W. B, <HI>as great a louer of his learning and vertues.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THe &s;tocke of the ORTELS flouri&s;hed not long &s;ince, and liued in good &s;tate and credit at Au&s;purg in Bayern, (<HI>Augu&s;tam vindelicorum,</HI> the Latines called it.) From that family came WILLIAM ORTELL, who about the yere of our Lord 1460 left his natiue country, and &s;eated him&s;elfe in Antwerpe, (at that time one of the famou&s;e&s;t Mart-townes of the world) where he did many notable things worthily de&s;eruing great commendation: among which that is mo&s;t memorable, that of his owne proper co&s;t and charges he cau&s;ed a goodly cro&s;&s;e of free &s;tone to be &s;et vp without the Emperours gate, in that place where the malefactours are v&s;ually woont to be executed and put to death. Beneath this cro&s;&s;e, at the ba&s;e or foot of the &s;ame, &s;tood Mary and Iohn, and be&s;ide them, a little farther off, hung the two theeues; the one vpon the right hand and the other vpon the left, vpon their &s;euerall gibbets. This <HI>William</HI> died vpon the &s;euenth day of Ia|nuary in the yeere of our Lord God 1511, and was buried in the cloi&s;ters of the Franci&s;cane Friers in Antwerpe, leauing his &s;onne LEONARD ORTELL &s;ole Executor, and heire, not only of his goods and &s;ub&s;tance, but al&s;o of his vertues and good qualities: For they report that he was a man &s;o deuout and religious, that it was an hard matter to finde him from his booke, &s;erious meditation on heauenly matters. This <HI>Leonard</HI> maried ANNA HER|VVAYERS, and by her had i&s;&s;ue two daughters, and one &s;ome named ABRAHAM, (who&s;e life we heere pur|po&s;e to de&s;cribe) borne vpon the &s;econd day of Aprill, in the yeere of our Lord God 1527. Hee was euen in his child-hood of &s;ingular towardne&s;&s;e, great capacity and pa&s;sing quicke conceit, and, that which is very &s;trange in youth, hee was neuer giuen to the reading of any trifles or idle vanities. Wherefore his father purpo&s;ing to make him a &s;cholar, began fir&s;t him&s;elfe to in&s;truct him priuatly at home in his owne hou&s;e in the Latine and Greeke tongues: (For the old man was very learned in both the&s;e languages.) But &s;ee how the&s;e good purpo&s;es were &s;oon cro&s;&s;ed by the vntimely death of his mo&s;t louing and kinde father! who departing this life, in the yeere of Chri&s;t 1535, left this his &s;onne to be further informed and taught abroade by &s;trange &s;choolema&s;ters, who&s;e care and diligence to profit him, what&s;oeuer their learning were, was nothing &s;o great and painfull: notwith&s;tanding euen vnder the&s;e he made &s;uch profit in the Artes and liberall Sciences, that he was not much inferiour to the be&s;t of his degree and time: For, as I &s;aid before, no vaine plea&s;ure, or trifles, pa&s;times (which commonly are the ouerthrow of many yongue men) could euer with-draw him from his &s;etled purpo&s;e, or alienate his minde from his booke. Yet his greate&s;t delight and commendation con&s;i&s;ted in the knowledge of the Mathematicall &s;ciences, which for the mo&s;t part he &s;tudied and practi&s;ed without an in&s;tructor, or teacher, atteining, only by his owne paines and indu&s;trie, to the great admiration of others, euen to the vnder&s;tanding of the greate&s;t and deepe&s;t my&s;teries of the &s;ame. In the thirtieth yeare of his age, hauing many great matters in his head, and loathing to liue idly at home in his owne natiue country, he began to entertaine a conceipt of trauelling into diuers and &s;undry forreine parts and countries of the world. To Frankford vpon the Main, by rea&s;on of the great Marts or Faires, there held at two &s;euerall times euery yere, he went very often. In the yeere of our Lord 1575, he went with <HI>Iohn Viuian</HI> of Valence, a Marchant, but a great louer of learning, and <HI>Hierome Scoliers</HI> of Antwerp, to Leige, Trier; Tungren and Mentz: of which iourney and peregrination of theirs, there is at this day a booke of his ex&s;tant in print, wherein he hath lear|nedly de&s;cribed the particulars ob&s;erued by them. In the yeere of Chri&s;t 1577, with <HI>Immanu&euml;l Demetrius</HI> of Ant|werpe, hee trauelled beyond the Seas, into England and Ireland. Italy, that nource of great wits, that worker of &s;trange woonders, that mother of reuerend antiquities and ancient monuments, hee vi&s;ited thri&s;e. The third time that he went thither, which was in the yeere 1578, he went in company of <HI>George Houfnayle</HI> of Antwerp, who was &s;o excellent a painter that he was greatly e&s;teemed and beloued of the illu&s;trious princes, <HI>Albert</HI> and <HI>VVilliam,</HI> Dukes of Bayern: of <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> Duke of Au&s;trich; yea and of <HI>Rudolphus</HI> him&s;elfe, at that time Emperour of the Germanes. But this his con&s;ort, to the great greefe of his friends and &s;uch as loued his &s;ingular qualities, left his life at Prage in Bohemia, vpon the thirteenth of Ianuary in the yeere of our Lord, 1600. This man was woorthy of longer life, if the Fates would re&s;pect men for their great parts and excellent vertues. But &s;o it is, that Death, like as the &s;ythe in Harue&s;t, cutteth downe, without di&s;tinction, a&s;well the yongue as old. There was nothing either in Germanie or in France, that was woorth the &s;eeing, that this our authour had not &s;eene and viewed with a cen|&s;orious and iudicious eie. At length, hauing ouercome &s;o many tedious and toil&s;ome trauels, he returned againe to Antwerpe his natiue &s;oile. There and then he began to apply him&s;elfe to benefit &s;uccedent ages, to write of
<PB REF="3"> tho&s;e countries by him viewed and &s;eene, to &s;et out in Charts and Mappes diuers places both of Sea and Land vn|knowen to former ages, to de&s;cribe the tracts and coa&s;ts of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, South and North neuer &s;poken of nor touched by Ptolemey, Pliny, Strabo, Mela or any other hi&s;toriographer what&s;oeuer: and la&s;tly to bend all his forces to the framing of that his THEATER, which now is beheld and read with &s;uch admiration and applau&s;e of all men: in which worke of his he was &s;o generally well liked and approued of all, that Philip the Second, that renowmed King of Spaine, graced him with the honour and title of <HI>The Kings Co&s;mographer.</HI> He wrot al&s;o his GEOGRAPHICALL TREASVRE, a very learned and plea&s;ant worke, in which the ancient names or appel|lations, (yea and oft times the new, by which they are now called and knowen at this day,) of Mountaines, Hils, Promontories, Woods, Ilands, Hauens, People, Cities, Townes, Villages, Seas, Baies, Creekes, Straights, Riuers, &amp;c. are at one view in&s;tantly to be &s;eene. Moreouer, out of ancient coines, for the benefit and delight of &s;uch as are louers and &s;tudious of antiquities, he &s;et out The HEADS OF THE GODS AND GODDESSES, which afterward were illu&s;trated with an hi&s;toricall narration or di&s;cour&s;e done by Francis Sweert the yonger. In the yeere of Chri&s;t 1596, he &s;et forth THE IMAGE OF THE GOLDEN WORLD, that is, A treati&s;e de&s;cri|bing the life, Maners, Cu&s;tomes, Rites and Religion of the ancient Germans, collected and gathered out of diuers and &s;undry old writers of both languages. By the&s;e his labours and trauels he hath gotten and purcha&s;ed vnto him&s;elfe an immortall name and credit among&s;t the learned of all &s;orts. In company he was of an excellent di&s;|creete cariage, pa&s;sing courteous, merry and plea&s;ant. Such was his &s;ingular humanity, that it was &s;trange to &s;ee how he did winne and retaine the loue and fauour of all men where&s;oeuer he became. His enemies he cho&s;e rather to ouercome with kindne&s;&s;e, or to contemne them then to reuenge him&s;elfe of their malice. He did &s;o much hate vice, euen in his owne kindred, that he rather reuerenced vertue in his enemies and &s;trangers. Vaine que&s;tions, and &s;ubtill di&s;putations of diuinity, or matters of religion, as dangerous and pernicious, hee did alwaies greatly dete&s;t and abhorre. A deepe in-&s;ight and &s;ound iudgment in any kinde of matter, he preferred before glo&s;ing elo|quence and quaint termes. Pre&s;ent aduer&s;ity and daungers he alwaies endured with more patience then feare of &s;uch as were comming on and neere at hand: and tho&s;e which were bitter, more ea&s;ily then &s;uch as were doubtfull and vncertaine of euent. He was a man which in his life time did &s;et as little by him&s;elfe as any man could: For he neuer &s;et his minde much vpon the wealth of this world, or ought of tho&s;e things in the &s;ame, hauing alwaies in memory that his learned poe&s;ie CONTEMNO ET ORNO, MENTE, MANV, <HI>I &s;corne and trimme, with minde, with hand.</HI> For &s;urely this man was led with &s;ome heauenly &s;pirit, which did &s;o with-draw his minde from tho&s;e earthly cogitations, that he neuer tooke any thing in his life more vnkindly then when he was drawne from his bookes, which he alwaies preferred before all other things in the world be&s;ide. The&s;e great learned men follow|ing were his familiar friends, and &s;uch as he did greatly loue and reuerence. In Spain <HI>Benedictus Arias Montanus,</HI> that great lingui&s;t and graue Diuine; and the reuerend father <HI>Andrew Schotte,</HI> borne in Antwerp, a learned Ie&s;uite. In Italy, <HI>Fuluius Vr&s;inus, Franci&s;cus Superantius,</HI> and <HI>Iohannes Sambucus.</HI> In Germany, <HI>Gerard Mercator,</HI> that famous Co&s;|mographer, <HI>Iames Monaw, Marke Vel&s;er, Ioachim Chamberlin, Ionas Grutterus</HI> of Antwerp, and <HI>Arnold Milius.</HI> In France, <HI>Petrus Pithoeus,</HI> and others. In the Low-countries, <HI>Iu&s;tus Lip&s;ius, Laeuinus Tormencius, Nicolaus Rockoxius, Cornelius Pru|nius, Baltha&s;ar Robianus, Ludouicus Perezius, Iohannes Brantius</HI> a ciuillian, recorder to the &s;tate of Antwerp, <HI>Iohannes Bo|chius,</HI> &s;ecretarie to the &s;ame city, <HI>Francis Raphalengius, Chri&s;topher Plantine, Iohn Moret, Philip Gally, Otho Venius</HI> that famous painter, and <HI>Francis Sweert</HI> the yonger. In England, <HI>Humfrey Lloyd,</HI> the only learned courtiour of his time, and <HI>VVil|liam Camden,</HI> now Clarenceux, the painfull and iudicious antiquary of our land. With all the&s;e and many other he was familiarly acquainted. To the&s;e he wrot often, and from the&s;e he often receiued mo&s;t kinde and louing let|ters. He was a great &s;tudent of antiquities, and &s;earcher out of rare and ancient things. He had at home in his hou&s;e, Images, Statues, Coines of Gold, Siluer and copper both of the Greeks, Romans and others: Shelfi&s;hes brought from India and our Antipodes: Marble of all kinde of colours: Tortei&s;es &s;helles of &s;uch wonderfull big|ne&s;&s;e, that tenne men, &s;itting round in a circle, might eate meat out of them at once: Others againe &s;o little and narrow, that they were skarce &s;o bigge as a pinnes head. His Library was &s;o maruellou&s;ly well &s;tored with all &s;ort of Bookes, that his hou&s;e might iu&s;tly haue beene termed, A &s;hoppe of all manner of good learning, vnto which men flocked from diuers places, like as in former times they did to Plato's Academy, or Ari&s;totle's Lyceum. This <HI>Erne&s;t</HI> and <HI>Albert,</HI> returning conquerour from the battaill at Hul&s;ten, with other great Princes, and men of all &s;orts, came in troops to &s;ee and behold. While he was thus bu&s;ied, and hauing now liued aboue threeskore and eleuen yeeres, he fell &s;icke in Iune in the yeere of our Lord 1598, and growing euery day wor&s;e and wor&s;e, at length, he yeelded to nature and died vpon the 28 day of the &s;ame moneth. The Phy&s;icians affirmed that he died of an vlcer of the reines, which Hippocrates writeth will hardly euer be cured in old men. He was of &s;tature tall and &s;lender; the haire of his head and beard was of a yealow colour. His eies were gray, and his forehead broad. He was very courteous and affable. In &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;&s;es he was very graue and &s;ober, but without any &s;hew of arrogant di&s;|daine: in mirth and ie&s;ting he was as plea&s;ant, yet with that moderation, that all was guided by the rules of Chri|&s;tian piety and mode&s;ty. This decea&s;ed bachelour, Anna Ortell, a virgine his &s;i&s;ter, who liued not long after this her brother Abraham, (for &s;he died in the yeere of Grace 1600) cau&s;ed to be buried and intombed in Saint Mi|cha&euml;ls, the Abby of the Praemon&s;traten&s;es in Antwerp. He might well want the honour of a gorgeous and co&s;tly tombe, who by the generall con&s;ent of all men, had for his rare and &s;ingular vertues de&s;erued an euerla&s;ting fame and reputation. Francis Sweert, the yonger, gathered together the mournefull ver&s;es of tho&s;e poets and friends of his, which did bewaile his death, &s;et them foorth, and dedicated them to the State and citizens of Antwerp. Iu&s;tus Lip&s;ius, at the in&s;tant reque&s;t of his heires, and for a perpetuall memoriall of their con&s;tant loue and friend&s;hip wrote that Epitaph which is in capitall letters ingrauen vpon his tombe.</P>

<HEAD>ABRAHAM ORTE|LIVS CITIZEN OF ANT|werpe, and Geographer to Philip the &s;econd, King of Spaine, to the cour|teous Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_SEeing, that as I thinke, there is no man, gentle Reader, but knoweth what, and how great profit the knowledge of <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> doth bring to tho&s;e which are &s;erious &s;tudents therein; I doe verily beleeue and per&s;wade my&s;elfe, that there is almo&s;t no man, be it that he haue made neuer &s;o little an entrance into the &s;ame, and touched them neuer &s;o lightly, that is ignorant how nece&s;&s;ary, for the vnder&s;tanding of them aright, the knowledge of <HI>GEOGRA|PHY</HI> is, which, in that respect therefore is of &s;ome, and not without iu&s;t cau&s;e called <HI>The eye of Hi&s;tory.</HI> For thou &s;halt meet with many things in the reading of Hi&s;tories, (I will not &s;ay, almo&s;t all) which, except thou haue the knowledge of the countreys and places mentioned in them, cannot onely not bee well conceiued and vnder&s;tood, but al&s;o oft-times they are cleane mi&s;taken and otherwi&s;e vnder&s;tood then they ought to bee: which thing commeth to pa&s;&s;e in many di&s;cour&s;es: but especially in the expeditions and voyages of great Kings, Captaines and Emperours: in the diuers and &s;undry &s;hiftings of Nations from one place to another: and in the traueils and peregrinations of famous men, made into &s;undry countreys. But &s;eeing that this is a matter which euen experience it &s;elfe doeth teach vs to be true, there is no rea&s;on why I &s;hould &s;tand long vp|on the proofe of the &s;ame. This &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a knowledge of <HI>Geography,</HI> as many worthy and learned men haue te&s;tified, may very ea&s;ily be learn'd out of <HI>Geographicall Chartes</HI> or Mappes. And when we haue acquainted our &s;elues &s;omewhat with the v&s;e of the&s;e <HI>Tables</HI> or Mappes, or haue attained thereby to &s;ome rea&s;onable knowledge of <HI>Geography,</HI> what&s;oeuer we &s;hall read, the&s;e <HI>Chartes</HI> being placed, as it were certaine gla&s;&s;es before our eyes, will the longer be kept in memory, and make the deeper impre&s;sion in vs: by which meanes it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that now we do &s;eeme to perceiue &s;ome fruit of that which we haue read. I omit here, that the reading of <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> doeth both &s;eeme to be much more plea&s;ant, and in deed &s;o it is, when the Mappe being layed before our eyes, we may behold things done, or places where they were done, as if they were at this time pre&s;ent and in doing. For how much we are holpen, when as in the Holy Scripture, we read of the iourney of the I&s;ra&euml;lites, which they made from <HI>Egypt,</HI> through the Red &s;ea, and that &s;ame huge Wilderne&s;&s;e, into the Land of promi&s;e, when as looking vpon the Mappe of <HI>Pale&s;tina,</HI> we doe almo&s;t a&s;well &s;ee it as if we were there, I thinke any &s;tudent in Diuini|tie, or that Hi&s;tory hath oft made triall. Which things being &s;o, how much tho&s;e which are &s;tudents and louers of <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> are combred, hindred and &s;tayd, yea, &amp; many times, euen while they are in their race and continued cour&s;e, drawne backe, it is an ea&s;ie matter to conceiue, when either the de&s;cription of all countreys cannot be gotten, or if they may be gotten, they are dea|rer then that euery mans money will reach and attaine vnto especially tho&s;e that are but poore, or none of the wealthie&s;t. For there are many that are much delighted with <HI>Geography</HI> or <HI>Chorography,</HI> and especially with Mappes or Tables con|tayning the plotts and de&s;criptions of Countreys, &s;uch as there are many now adayes extant and euery where to be &s;old: But becau&s;e that either they haue not that, that &s;hould buy them: or if they haue &s;o much as they are worth, yet they will not lay it out, they neglect them, neither do they any way &s;atisfie them&s;elues. Others there are who when they haue that which will buy them, would very willingly lay out the money, were it not that by rea&s;on of the narrowne&s;&s;e of the roomes and places, broad and large Mappes cannot &s;o be opened or &s;pread, that euery thing in them may ea&s;ily and well be &s;eene and di&s;cern'd. For, that I may &s;peake that which is the trueth, tho&s;e great and large <HI>Geographicall</HI> Maps or Chartes, which are folded or rowl'd vp, are not &s;o commodious: nor, when any thing is peraduenture read in them, &s;o ea&s;ie to be look'd vpon. And he that will in or|der hang them all along vpon a wall, had need haue not only a very large &amp; wide hou&s;e, but euen a Princes gallery or &s;pacious Theater. This I hauing oft made triall of, I began to bethinke my &s;elfe, what meanes might be found to redre&s;&s;e the&s;e di&s;com|modities, which I haue &s;poken of, and either to make them &s;omewhat le&s;&s;e, or, if po&s;sibly it might bee, to take them all cleane away. And at length me thought it might be done by that meanes which we haue ob&s;erued and &s;et downe in this our booke, to which I earne&s;tly wi&s;h that euery &s;tudent would affoord a place in his Library, amongst the re&s;t of his bookes.</P>
<P>But that thou maye&s;t the better vnder&s;tand, what it is that wee haue done in this our Theater, and what it is that thou mu&s;t ex&s;pect and looke for in the &s;ame; I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e in few wordes briefly here to declare vnto thee. First
<PB REF="4"> my purpo&s;e was to repre&s;ent vnto thy view what&s;oeuer heretofore thou had'&s;t, or new ha&s;t, in any <HI>Geographical</HI> or <HI>Choro|graphicall</HI> Chartes here and there lately or long &s;ince &s;et out that euer came to my handes, or were po&s;sibly to bee gotten for loue or money. Of all countreys who&s;e de&s;criptions are &s;et out in <HI>Geographicall</HI> Tables, we haue &s;elected one (for of &s;ome there are diuers) which in our iudgement &s;eemed to bee the best and most exact: Which, notwithstanding that it were, by the first draught of the Authour &s;omewhat large and broad, we haue brought into that &s;mall forme, as might agree with this our worke, and that the whole Mappe might be contein'd in one leafe: or, which &s;ometime thou &s;halt ob&s;erue we haue done, as thou may'st &s;ee, that in one leafe many might bee contein'd and expre&s;sed: yet &s;o as nothing, no neuer &s;o &s;mall a thing, is either omitted or altered that was to bee found in the greater: except it be this, which oftentimes thou &s;halt finde, that the names of places and other things, which in the first Copies could hardly be read, in the&s;e our Mappes we haue &s;o expre&s;sed, that they may perfectly be read of any man. And &s;ometime, where occa&s;ion did &s;erue, or need require, and the place would permit, vnto the moderne and v&s;uall names of certaine places, wee haue added the ancient names mentioned by old writers, but now vulgarly vnknowne. Which, as we doubt not, we haue done with the good-leaue and liking of the Authours them&s;elues: &s;o I hope it will be a thing very well plea&s;ing to all &s;uch as are readers and &s;tudents of old Histories and Antiquities. In tho&s;e Mappes, which haue their Authours names written vpon them, we haue, as I &s;aid, altered nothing at all, excepting two or three of the Marine tracts of the <HI>Low-countreys,</HI> which the Sea hath much changed &s;ince the time that their de&s;criptions were first &s;et foorth: As for examples &s;ake, in <HI>Flaunders,</HI> ouer against <HI>Zeland,</HI> not farre from the towne <HI>Wateruliet,</HI> where by the goodne&s;&s;e and great benefit of Almighty God, long after that the de&s;cription of this Countrey was first &s;et out, the Maine-land was much enlarged and had gotten an aduantage of the Sea: wee there haue altered the forme of that Mappe, according as the place is found to be at this day. The de&s;cription of which plot of ground we obteined of Master <HI>Marke Lau|rine,</HI> the Lord and owner thereof, a braue gentleman, greatly renowmed both for the noble &s;tocke from whence hee is de&s;cen|ded, as al&s;o for his wi&s;dome and great experience. But in other Mappes, which had no name of the Authour &s;ub&s;cribed vnto them, we were &s;omewhat more bold: for in the&s;e, in &s;ome places, at our di&s;cretion, where we thought good, wee haue al|tered &s;ome-things, &s;ome-things we haue put out, and otherwhere, if it &s;eemed to be nece&s;&s;ary, we haue put in. Of &s;ome Coun|treys al&s;o, that we might, as much as in vs did lye, make vp our iust number and fill vp our ranke, we haue made &s;ome Mappes of our owne, that there might as few Mappes be wanting as po&s;sibly might be. In the abridgement and bringing of tho&s;e Mappes, which had as I &s;aid the names of the Authours added vnto them into a le&s;&s;er forme, we haue v&s;ed that faithfulne&s;&s;e and diligence, that we hope to de&s;erue thankes not onely of the Reader, but al&s;o euen of the Authours them&s;elues, or at least we haue dealt &s;o in them, that no man need be a&s;ham'd of the&s;e of ours what&s;oeuer they be; yea he may a&s;well acknowledge and take this little one of ours, for his owne, as that greater one first &s;et out by him&s;elfe. For wee haue endeuoured to the vttermost of our power in this our worke, if it were po&s;sible, to de&s;erue thankes of the Authours, if not, yet by no meanes to displea&s;e them: Not to follow or imitate that bad custome of &s;ome men in the&s;e our dayes, who, that they may &s;eeme to the world to &s;et foorth &s;ome new thing, doe nothing els but alter the workes and labours of other men, and oftentimes, out of tho&s;e which are good, to &s;elect that which is not good, and to &s;ell it commonly for the best: Sometimes by adding &s;omething at their plea&s;ure, and in &s;ome places againe taking out and detracting &s;omething and withall either by concealing the right Authors names, or &s;etting to their owne, or feyning a name of &s;ome one or other, they thinke to plea&s;e the vulgar &s;ort with nouelties, that that their worke may &s;ell the better; and they may rake money together they care not how: For we were not mooued to vndertake this labour by any couetous de&s;ire of getting much by it, but euen of a willing and forward minde that wee had to helpe and further tho&s;e that had a loue and affection to the&s;e &s;tudies, not any whit respecting the gayning of any vaine glory and commendation by other mens labours. For what need we to make new Mappes, when as the old Mappes of other men, now extant, would &s;erue our turne? Some there are peraduenture, which will looke to finde in this our Theater more de|&s;criptions of particular Countreys, (for euery man naturally, for the loue that he beareth to his natiue &s;oile, would, I doubt not, wi&s;h that it were here &s;euerally de&s;cribed among&s;t the rest:) but let them know, that tho&s;e which are here mi&s;sing, are not left out and omitted, either by our negligence, or for that we were lothe to be at that cost and charges: but becau&s;e that ei|ther we neuer &s;aw any &s;uch, or at leastwayes for that there neuer came any &s;uch to our hands. If there be any man, which either hath any &s;uch, or knoweth where there may be had, him we would earne&s;tly entreate, that he would be the meanes to helpe vs vnto them, a&s;&s;uredly promi&s;ing him, that we will, at our owne co&s;t and charges, not without great thankes to him, and a mo&s;t honourable mention of his name, cau&s;e them to be cut and imprinted apart and by them&s;elues, that hereafter they may be in&s;erted into this our Booke, either in their owne place, el&s;ewhere, as any man &s;hall like be&s;t.</P>
<P>Of the Order al&s;o by vs here ob&s;erued in the placing of the&s;e our Mappes, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e, gentle Reader, to &s;peake a word or two, and to acquaint thee with our purpo&s;e: that if peraduenture there be any man, which doeth thinke that they ought to haue bene placed otherwi&s;e, we may either &s;atisfie him, if we may, or els excu&s;e our &s;elues, which is all, I thinke, that can be looked for at our hands. Fir&s;t of all, we pre&s;ent vnto thy view an <HI>Vniuer&s;all Mappe</HI> of the whole world: Then, the foure quarters or principall parts of the &s;ame; to wit, <HI>Europe, A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America:</HI> in this following dame Na|ture, in which alwayes before the parts can be, the whole, whereof they be the parts, mu&s;t of nece&s;sitie fir&s;t be. Next after the&s;e we haue put the &s;euerall and <HI>particular Countreys</HI> of the&s;e parts, beginning at the We&s;t part of the world, in this fol|lowing <HI>Ptolemey</HI> the Prince of Geographers, and almo&s;t all others that haue written of this argument: And &s;o the Pro|uinces and <HI>particular countreys of America</HI> do fir&s;t put foorth and &s;hew them&s;elues: next to the&s;e do follow the <HI>Britti&s;h Iles,</HI> after them <HI>Spaine,</HI> and then <HI>France.</HI> From hence we pa&s;&s;e to <HI>Germany:</HI> who&s;e Countreys being after our maner dili|gently &s;urueyed, from <HI>Heluetia</HI> or <HI>Switzerland</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed ouer the Mountaines into <HI>Italy,</HI> which is the next countrey vnto it Ea&s;tward, purpo&s;ing al&s;o to view all the Prouinces thereof &s;euerally. From thence we cro&s;sed the Sea and &s;ayl'd into <HI>Greece.</HI> Whereupon going into <HI>Slauonia,</HI> we &s;urueyed all the Countreys &s;euerally which do vulgarly &s;peake the Slauonian
<PB REF="5"> tongue, (to wit, <HI>Hungary, Tran&s;&s;yluania, Polonia, Scandia,</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;sia.</HI>) Thus hauing fini&s;hed <HI>Europe,</HI> we come vn|to the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> or Straight land, which is betweene the head of the Riuer <HI>Tanais</HI> and the North &s;ea, which is in deed the bound of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> from it we &s;tep into <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Which, after we haue a while beheld, we left, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> by the Streights, or narrow piece of the Mainland, which runneth betweene the Bay of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and the gulfe of <HI>Damiata, (Sirbonis lacus)</HI> made by the ouerflowing of the Midland-&s;ea. From thence pa&s;sing through <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Barbary</HI> wee came vnto the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> which we cro&s;&s;ed, and at length came home againe to our owne natiue countrey from whence we first &s;et foote; like vnto a trauailer or a Pilgrime, which hath viewed and trauailed through many and &s;undry &s;euerall Nations and Countreys, pa&s;sing out of one into another, orderly as they lay and were &s;ituate one by another, ouer|skipping none, at last returneth &s;afely and ioyfully from whence he first &s;et foorth.</P>
<P>Thus farre of the Mappes them&s;elues: Now let vs &s;peake a word or two of the back&s;ide of the &s;ame. Becau&s;e we thought it would be a thing nothing plea&s;ing to the Reader or Beholder, to &s;ee the backe&s;ides of the leaues altogether bare and empty we determined there to make a certaine briefe and &s;hort declaration and Historicall di&s;cour&s;e of euery Mappe, in the &s;ame maner and order as we &s;aid we ob&s;erued in the Mappes them&s;elues; omitting nor concealing any mans name, that we had oc|ca&s;ion to v&s;e. Moreouer to the&s;e al&s;o we haue added a Table of the names of all the Authours, that euer wee knew or had; out of which, tho&s;e that are &s;o dispo&s;ed, may fetch a more ample and larger di&s;cour&s;e and de&s;cription of the &s;euerall Countreys handled by them. Wherefore the &s;tudents of <HI>Geography</HI> &s;hall haue here, in the Authours thus named in order, and in the Catalogue of the Authours of the Geographicall Tables or Mappes, which we haue &s;et before this our worke, and lastly in the&s;e Tables them&s;elues, a certaine &s;hoppe, as it were, furni&s;hed with all kinde of instruments nece&s;&s;arily required in &s;uch like bu&s;ine&s;&s;e: out of which, if peraduenture there may &s;eeme any thing wanting, in his iudgement, either to the fini&s;hing of any Booke of that argument, or more fuller de&s;criptions of any Countreys what&s;oeuer, very ea&s;ily, or in deed without any la|bour at all he may &s;ee, from whence it may by and by be fetched.</P>
<P>The&s;e things they are which I thought good to admoni&s;h the Reader of. It remaineth now, that wee doe entreate euery man, to take this our labour and entertaine it, with no other minde then it was by vs both begunne and fini&s;hed, and at length &s;et out and Imprinted. Farewell, and wi&s;h well to <HI>Francis Hogenberg, Ferdinand,</HI> and <HI>Ambro&s;e Ar&s;en,</HI> by who&s;e skil|full hands and extraordinary great paines and diligence almost all the&s;e Mappes were engrauen and cut.</P>

<P>_THIS Map next en&s;uing containeth and repre&s;enteth the portraiture of the whole earth, and of the maine Ocean that enuirons &amp; compa&s;&s;eth the &s;ame: all which earthly Globe the Ancients (who were not as then acquainted with the New world, not long &s;ince de|&s;cried) diuided into three parts; namely, <HI>Africa, Europe,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> But &s;ince that di&s;couery of <HI>America,</HI> the learned of our age haue made that a fourth part, and the huge Continent vnder the South pole, a fifth. <HI>Gerardus Mercator</HI> the Prince of moderne Geographers in his neuer-&s;ufficiently-commended vniuer&s;all Table or Map of the whole world, diuides this Circumference of the earth into three Continents: the fir&s;t he calles that, which the Anci|ents diuided into three parts, and from whence the holy Writ beares record, that mankinde had their fir&s;t origi|nall, &amp; fir&s;t was &s;eated: the &s;econd, is that which at this pre&s;ent is named <HI>America</HI> or the <HI>VVest Indies:</HI> for the third, he appoints the South maine, which &s;ome call <HI>Magellanica,</HI> as yet on very few coa&s;ts thorowly di&s;couered. That this orbe or ma&s;&s;e of the earthly Globe containes in circuit, where it is large&s;t, 5400 German or 21600 Italian miles, antiquity hath taught, &amp; late Writers haue &s;ub&s;cribed to their opinion. <HI>And the&s;e &s;o manifold portions of earth</HI> (&s;ayth <HI>Plinie</HI> in the 11. booke of his Naturall hi&s;torie) <HI>yea rather, as &s;ome haue termed them, the pricke or center of the world (for &s;o &s;mall is the earth in compari&s;on of the whole frame of the world) this is the matter, this is the &s;eat of our glorie.

And to let pa&s;&s;e the publike tumults of the world, this in which we force the borderers to giue place and remoue farther off, and where we incroch by &s;telth vpon our neighbors lands: as he that extends his lands &amp; lord&s;hips farthe&s;t, and cannot abide that any &s;hould &s;eat them&s;elues too neere his no&s;e, How great, or rather how &s;mall a por|tion of earth doth he enioy?

<P>_WHy <HI>Europe</HI> &s;hould be &s;o called, or who was the fir&s;t Authour of this name, no man as yet hath found out; vnle&s;&s;e (&s;ayth <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his fourth booke) we &s;hould thinke that the whole region borrowed this name from <HI>Europa</HI> daughter to the King of <HI>Epyrus.</HI> This <HI>Plinie</HI> calleth the Nur&s;e of the victorious and conquering people of all other nations of the world, mo&s;t beautifull and farre &s;urpa&s;sing the re&s;t: and &s;o it is &s;ome|times compared to <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> not for his greatne&s;&s;e and compa&s;&s;e, but for his might and power. Certaine it is, that this part, being mo&s;t plentifully inhabited, is for multitude of nations inferiour to neither of the other. The North and We&s;terne &s;ides hereof are bathed by the Ocean; the South coa&s;t is di&s;ioyned from <HI>Africa</HI> by the Mediterranean &s;ea. Then Ea&s;tward by the Aegaean &s;ea (now called <HI>Archipelago</HI>) by the Euxin &s;ea (named at this pre&s;ent <HI>Mar Maggiore</HI>) by the lake of <HI>Maeotis</HI> (now termed <HI>Mar delle Zabacche</HI>) by the riuer Tanais (commonly called <HI>Don</HI>) and by the I&s;thmus or &s;traight of the maine land, which is from the head or fountaine of this riuer directly vnto the North Ocean; it is diuided from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> according to the opinion of <HI>Glarean.</HI> And thus it beares the &s;hape of a Penin&s;ula (which &s;ignifies a place of the earth almo&s;t di&s;ioyned and cut from the Conti|nent, and &s;o well neere on euery &s;ide enuironed with waters) as in the Table it &s;elfe is ma|nife&s;t. The head hereof <HI>Rome,</HI> was whilome conquere&s;&s;e of the earth.</P>
<P>The regions thereof (as they are now called) are <HI>Spaine, France, Germanie, Italie, Sla|uonia, Greece, Hungarie, Poland</HI> with <HI>Lithuania, Mo&s;couia,</HI> or more &s;ignificantly <HI>Ru&s;sia;</HI> and that Penin&s;ula which conteineth <HI>Norway, Sweden,</HI> and <HI>Gotland.</HI> Among the I&s;les thereof the fir&s;t place is due to <HI>Britany</HI> conteining <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland;</HI> then followes <HI>Ireland, Groenland, Fri&s;land,</HI> and <HI>I&s;land:</HI> all &s;ituate in the maine Ocean. In the Mediter|ran &s;ea it hath <HI>Sicilia, Sardinia, Cor&s;ica, Candia, Maiorica, Minorica, Corfu, Negro|pont;</HI> and others of le&s;&s;e note, the particular names and &s;ituations whereof are to be &s;eene in the Table.</P>
<P>This our <HI>Europe,</HI> be&s;ides the Roman Empire reuerenced of all the world, hath in all (if you adde tho&s;e foureteene, which <HI>Damianus &agrave; Goes</HI> reckens vp only in <HI>Spaine</HI>) eight and twentie Chri&s;tian Kingdomes: whereby you may e&s;timate the worthine&s;&s;e of this region. It is a place out of mea&s;ure fruitfull: and the naturall di&s;po&s;ition of his aire is ve|ry temperate. For all kindes of Graine, for Wine, and abundance of Woods, it is infe|rior to none, but comparable to the be&s;t of the others. It is &s;o plea&s;ant, and &s;o beautified with &s;tately Cities, Townes and Villages, that for the courage and valour of the people and &s;euerall nations, although it be le&s;&s;e in quantitie and circuit, yet might it well be ac|counted, and indeed of all ancient Writers hath it euer beene accounted &s;uperiour vnto the other parts of the World: mo&s;t renowmed al&s;o hath it beene both in regard of the Macedonian Empire, and the great command and power of the Romans. The prai&s;es thereof you may reade in <HI>Strabo,</HI> who in his third booke, and &s;euen bookes fol|lowing, hath mo&s;t learnedly and excellently de&s;cribed it. Peru&s;e al&s;o other ancient Ge|ographers. Of late Writers, among&s;t other things by the way, <HI>&V;olateranus, Sebastian Munster, Dominicus Niger, Georgius Rithaimerus,</HI> in their Geographies, haue en|deuoured to paint it out in his colours. But <HI>Pius</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Chri&s;topher Cella</HI> and <HI>An|&s;elmus</HI> his brother haue de&s;cribed it a part and by it &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Diuers Iournals ouer all <HI>Europe</HI> in a maner, together with the di&s;tances of places, haue beene committed to writing by <HI>Cherubin Stella, John Herbacius,</HI> and <HI>George Mayerus.</HI> The like hath beene done by <HI>William Gratarolus</HI> in the end of his booke, which is entitled, <HI>De regimine iter agentium,</HI> or <HI>A direction for trauellers.</HI></P>

<P>_THis the Ancients haue diuer&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed; but at this pre&s;ent it is diuided by <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> of <HI>A|frica,</HI> into foure chiefe parts; <HI>Barbarie, Numidia, Libya,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Negros.</HI> BARBARIE, which is accounted the be&s;t, they circum&s;cribe with the Atlantick &amp; Mediterranean &s;eas; with mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> &amp; with the region of <HI>Barcha</HI> bordering vpon <HI>Aegypt.</HI> NVMIDIA, called by the inhabitants <HI>Biledulgerid,</HI> and abounding with Dates (for which cau&s;e the Arabians call it by no other name, but the Date-bearing region) is bounded We&s;tward by the Atlantick Ocean; Northward by mount <HI>Atlas;</HI> it &s;tretcheth Ea&s;t as farre as the citie <HI>Eloacat,</HI> which is an hundred miles di&s;tant from <HI>Aegypt;</HI> and the &s;andie De&s;erts of <HI>Libya</HI> embrace it on the South. LIBYA the third part, is named in the Arabian tongue <HI>Sarra,</HI> which word &s;ignifies a De&s;ert. It beginnes Ea&s;t from <HI>Nilus,</HI> and thence runneth We&s;t as farre as the Atlantick &s;ea; <HI>Numidia</HI> lies to the North of it, and the Land of <HI>Negros</HI> to the South. Now followeth the fourth part, which they call NIGRITARVM <HI>terra,</HI> either from the inhabitants, which are of a blacke colour, or from the riuer <HI>Niger,</HI> that runneth thorow the countrey. It is confined North by <HI>Libya;</HI> South by the Aethiopick Ocean; We&s;t by <HI>Gualata;</HI> and Ea&s;t by the Kingdome of <HI>Gaoga.</HI> And here we are to note, that according to this their diui&s;ion all <HI>Africa</HI> is included within the Mediterran, Atlantick, and Aethiopick &s;eas and the riuer <HI>Nilus;</HI> wherefore <HI>Aegypt</HI> and <HI>Aethiopia</HI> are accounted parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which we notwith&s;tanding thinke more properly to belong to <HI>Africa:</HI> For the true <HI>Aethiopia</HI> containes at this day <HI>Presbyter Iohns</HI> Empire, which by all late Writers is a&s;cribed to <HI>Africa.</HI> We therefore with <HI>Ptolemey</HI> iudge that it ought to be bounded by the Mediterran and Ocean &s;eas, rather than by any riuer what&s;oeuer; and &s;o it hath the forme of a Penin&s;ula, being ioyned to <HI>A&s;ia</HI> by an I&s;thmos or &s;mall neck-land, which lies betweene the Mediterran &s;ea and the gulfe of <HI>Arabia.</HI> The South part here|of was vnknowen to our ance&s;tours, till the yeere 1497, whereas <HI>Va&s;co de Gama</HI> fir&s;t doubling the Cape <HI>de buona &s;pe|ranza</HI> or <HI>of good hope,</HI> and &s;ailing about <HI>Africa,</HI> came to <HI>Calicut</HI> in <HI>East India.</HI> This Southern part by the Per&s;ians and Arabians is called <HI>Zanzibar.</HI></P>
<P>At the fore&s;ayd Cape of good hope the inhabitants are exceeding blacke; which we thought in no wi&s;e to omit, becau&s;e all men &s;uppo&s;e the cau&s;e of blackne&s;&s;e to be heat, and the nearene&s;&s;e of the Sunne; wheras here the Sunne &s;corcheth no more, than about the Streight of <HI>Magellan</HI> (if we mea&s;ure the heat of the place, according to the po&s;iti|on of the heauens and di&s;tance from the Equinoctiall line) where notwith&s;tanding the people are reported to be maruellous white. But if we will needs a&s;cribe this blackne&s;&s;e to the &s;corching heat of the Sun, let vs con&s;ider, what makes the Spaniards and Italians looke &s;o white, whenas they are equally di&s;tant from the Equinoctiall with the in|habitants of the fore&s;ayd Cape; namely the one towards the South, and the other towards the North. <HI>Presbyter Iohns</HI> people are of a browne colour; in <HI>Zeilan</HI> and <HI>Malabar</HI> the inhabitants are coale blacke, yet all in one &amp; the &s;ame di&s;tance from the aequator, and vnder the very &s;ame parallele of the heauens. * And on the contrary, why did <HI>He|rodotus</HI> and <HI>Pindarus</HI> de&s;cribe &s;uch as inhabited the &s;ame climate with them&s;elues, namely <HI>Colchis,</HI> to be of a blacke colour, and curled haire? <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his <HI>Thalia</HI> makes the Indians blacke like the Aethiopians: which the experi|ence of our times confirmeth. I know <HI>Herodotus</HI> will haue the cau&s;e hereof to be the &s;eed of the parents, which he &s;ayth is not white, as that of other people, but blacke. To whom <HI>Po&s;tellus</HI> al&s;o &s;ub&s;cribeth, and imputeth the origi|nall of this blackne&s;&s;e vnto <HI>Chams</HI> cur&s;e. Again&s;t which opinion I haue nothing to allege. Let the trueth of the mat|ter re&s;t vpon the authours credit. But this a man may thinke more &s;trange; that in all <HI>America</HI> there were no blacke people found be&s;ides a few, only in one place called by them <HI>Quareca.</HI> What then is the efficient cau&s;e of this colour? Is it the drine&s;&s;e of the heauen, or of the earth? Is it perhaps &s;ome hidden propertie of the &s;oile? Or a kind of qua|litie inherent to the nature of men? Or is it all the&s;e vnited in one? But the&s;e things we leaue to be con&s;idered by them, who do more curiou&s;ly &s;earch into the &s;ecrets of nature.</P>
<P>This portion of the world is called by the Greeks <HI>Libya,</HI> and by the Latines <HI>Africa,</HI> becau&s;e it is not mole&s;ted with extremity of colde: or (if we may credit <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI>) from <HI>Afer</HI> one of <HI>Abrahams</HI> po&s;teritie. Another deriuation of the name you haue &s;et downe by <HI>Iohn Leo in the beginning of his fir&s;t booke of the De&s;cription of</HI> Africa, <HI>who deriueth it from the Ara|bick theme</HI> Faraka, <HI>&s;ignifying to di&s;ioine or &s;eparate; becau&s;e it is di&s;ioyned from</HI> Europe <HI>by the Mediterran &s;ea; from</HI> A&s;ia, <HI>as he &s;aith, by the riuer</HI> Nilus, <HI>or rather as the be&s;t authours haue taught, by the Arabian gulfe called of the Greeks</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, Mare rubrum <HI>the red &s;ea: of the Hebrewes</HI> <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> iam-&s;uff, mare algo&s;um vel iunco&s;um <HI>the &s;edgie &s;ea: of the Arabians the neere inhabitants</HI> Bahci 'lkulzom <HI>the &s;ea alkulzom.

<HEAD>The New World, commonly called AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>_THat all this Hemi&s;phere or halfe-rundle (which is called <HI>America,</HI> and in regard of the large exten&s;ion, <HI>The New world</HI>) &s;hould lie concealed from our ance&s;tours, till the yeere of Chri&s;t 1492, at what time <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus</HI> a Genoway fir&s;t di&s;couered the &s;ame; is a matter &s;urpa&s;&s;ing the mea&s;ure of human admiration. For con&s;idering both the diligence of ancient Geographers in de&s;cribing the World, and the commodious opportunitie of mo&s;t large Empires for the &s;earching out of new Regions, then al&s;o the in&s;atiable auarice of mankinde, leauing nothing vnattempted for the attaining of Golde and Siluer, wherewith the&s;e Countries incredibly abound; I haue often wondered, how it could &s;o long haue beene hidden from our World. Some there are which &s;uppo&s;e that this Continent was de&s;cribed by <HI>Plato</HI> vn|der the name of <HI>Atlas:</HI> my &s;elfe al&s;o am of opinion, that <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;peaking of the face in the bodie of the Moone, makes mention thereof vnder the name of a Maine continent. Some thinke that <HI>Seneca</HI> raui&s;ht with a Poeticall furie, pre&s;aged the di&s;couerie hereof in the&s;e Propheticall ver&s;es <HI>in the very end of the</HI> 2. <HI>Act. of</HI> Medea:</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;venient annis</L>
<L>Secula &s;eris, quibus Oceanus</L>
<L>Vincula rerum laxet &amp; ingens</L>
<L>Pateat tellus, Typhi&s;&abque; nouos</L>
<L>Detegat Orbes,</L>
<L>Nec fit terris vltima Thyle.</L></Q>
<P>In Engli&s;h thus:</P>
<Q><L>Long hence tho&s;e yeeres will come,</L>
<L>When th'Ocean &s;hall di&s;&s;olue</L>
<L>Natures fa&s;t bonds and barres.</L>
<L>Then &s;hall huge lands appeare,</L>
<L><HI>Typhis</HI> &s;hall then detect</L>
<L>New worlds; nor <HI>Thyle</HI> then</L>
<L>Shall bound the paths of men.</L></Q>
<P>Like to tho&s;e Sibyllin ver&s;es, which (as <HI>Iacobus Nauarchus</HI> writeth) were found at the foot of the promontorie of the Moone (commonly called <HI>Rochan de Sinna</HI>) vpon the Ocean &s;ea-&s;hore, ingrauen vpon a foure-&s;quare pillar, in the time of <HI>Don Emmanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> to this or the like purpo&s;e:</P>
<Q><L>Voluentur &s;axa literis &amp; ordine rectis,</L>
<L>C&ugrave;m videas Occidens Orientis opes.</L>
<L>Ganges, Indus, Tagus, erit mirabile vi&s;u,</L>
<L>Merces commutabit &s;uas vterque &s;ibi.</L></Q>
<P>In Engli&s;h thus:</P>
<Q><L>The &s;tone with my&s;tick letters, row'ld &s;hall bee,</L>
<L>When We&s;t the trea&s;ures of the Ea&s;t &s;hall &s;ee.</L>
<L>The Portugals and Indians (a thing admir'd)</L>
<L>Shall truck their wares, on either part de&s;ir'd.</L></Q>
<P>Howbeit, that the&s;e ver&s;es are not ancient, but grauen in our times; nor part of <HI>Sibylles</HI> Prophe&s;ies, but counterfait; I was ad|uerti&s;ed (being in hand with the &s;econd edition of this my <HI>Theatrum</HI>) from <HI>Rome,</HI> by <HI>Cae&s;ar Orlando</HI> a Ciuilian, in his letters, out of &s;ome printed works of <HI>Ga&s;par Varerius,</HI> in which &s;ince that I my &s;elfe haue read the &s;ame. And afterward I found it confirmed by <HI>Amil. Re&s;ende</HI> in his Antiquities of <HI>Portugale:</HI> namely, that in the time of <HI>Don Emmanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugale,</HI> one <HI>Hermes Caiado</HI> of the &s;ame countrey, cau&s;ed them to be ingrauen and buried in the earth: and when he &s;uppo&s;ed that the marble began to corrupt with the moi&s;ture of the ground; pretending &s;ome cau&s;e of recreation, he inuites his friends to a countrey-hou&s;e of his, neere vnto which this fained Prophe&s;ie lay hid. Wherefore being all &s;et at meat, in comes his Bailiffe with newes, that his Labourers had by chance digged vp a &s;tone engrauen with letters. They all immediatly runne forth, they reade it, they admire it, they highly e&s;teeme it, and are ready to adore it, &amp;c. See how apt <HI>Caiado</HI> was to delude his friends. <HI>Marinaeus Siculus</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Spaine</HI> writes, that there was found in Gold-mines an ancient piece of coine with <HI>Augustus Cae&s;ars</HI> image vpon it, and for the more confirmation of the matter, that it was &s;ent by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Con&s;ance</HI> to the Pope. But I am of opinion, that it was there lo&s;t by the &s;ame fa|milie which fir&s;t found it. <HI>Io&s;ephus Aco&s;ta</HI> in his booke <HI>De Natura noui orbis</HI> indeuours by many rea&s;ons to proue, that this part of <HI>America</HI> was originally inhabited by certaine Indians, forced thither by tempe&s;tuous weather ouer the South &s;ea which now they call <HI>Mare del Zur.</HI> But to me it &s;eemes more probable, out of the hi&s;torie of the two <HI>Zeni,</HI> gentlemen of <HI>Venice</HI> (which I haue put downe before the Table of the South &s;ea, and before that of Scandia) that this New world many ages pa&s;t was entred vpon by &s;ome i&s;landers of <HI>Europe,</HI> as namely of <HI>Groenland, I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Fri&s;land;</HI> being much neerer thereunto than the Indians, nor di&s;ioy|ned thence (as appeares out of the Map) by an Ocean &s;o huge, and to the Indians &s;o vnnauigable. Al&s;o, what el&s;e may we conie|cture to be &s;ignified by this word <HI>Norumbega</HI> (the name of a North region of <HI>America</HI>) but that from <HI>Norway,</HI> &s;ignifying a North land, &s;ome Colonie in times pa&s;t hath hither beene tran&s;planted? But why in mine opinion the maine Ocean was neuer &s;ailed by ancient Nauigatours, I haue declared in my <HI>The&s;aurus Geographicus,</HI> &s;peaking of OPHIR.</P>
<P>All this part of the World, (except the North tract thereof, who&s;e Coa&s;ts are not yet di&s;couered) hath in the&s;e la&s;t times beene &s;ailed round about. From North to South it &s;tretcheth in forme of two Penin&s;ulae or Demi-i&s;les, which are &s;euered by a very nar|row I&s;thmos or neck-land. The Northermo&s;t of the two conteineth <HI>New Spaine,</HI> the prouince of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the countrey of <HI>Florida</HI> and <HI>New-found-land.</HI> But the Southermo&s;t (which the Spaniards call <HI>Terra firma</HI>) containes <HI>Per&uacute;</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il.</HI> A de&s;cription of all which regions the &s;tudious in Geography may reade in <HI>Leuinus Apolonius,</HI> in the Decads of <HI>Peter Martyr,</HI> and in <HI>Maximilianus Tran&s;siluanus,</HI> who writ all in Latine. Al&s;o to this purpo&s;e you haue many things worthy the ob&s;eruation in the Ie&s;uites Epi&s;tles, and in <HI>Maffeius</HI> his &s;tory of the Indies. <HI>Postellus</HI> al&s;o promi&s;eth Di&s;cour&s;es of We&s;t-Indie-matters: and &s;o doth <HI>Fredericus Furius Caeriolanus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The peaceable or the &s;outh &s;ea, called by the Spaniards MAR DEL SVR.</HEAD>
<P>_THis &s;ea albeit vnknowen, yet was it not vnnamed by ancient writers: for <HI>Plinie</HI> calles it <HI>Ecum,</HI> and <HI>Oro&s;ius Orientale,</HI> that is, The Ea&s;t &s;ea. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> fal&s;ly termes it SINVM MAGNVM, A great bay; whereas he &s;hould haue nam'd it MARE MAG|NVM, A great &s;ea. For of all the &s;eas in the world it is the greate&s;t and the wide&s;t. In <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> it is de&s;cribed vnder the name of <HI>Mare Cin, (that is, as I interpret it out of Nubien&s;is Arabs,</HI> Bahci'ltzni vel alkini, Mare Sinarum, <HI>The &s;ea of China</HI>) and in <HI>Haithon Armenus</HI> (whom el&s;where we more truly call <HI>Antonie Curchino</HI>) by the name of <HI>Mare Cathay.</HI> Well therefore might it be named by the ancient and middle-age writers; but neuer was it fully knowen and di&s;couered, till <HI>Fernando Magel|lan</HI> a Portugale &s;ailed thereupon. Seene it was indeed, and as it were &s;aluted in the yeere 1513, by <HI>Va&s;co Nunnez,</HI> from the coa&s;t of <HI>Per&uacute;.</HI> But <HI>Magellan</HI> in the yeere of our &s;aluation 1520. hauing pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treight by him found, and called after his owne name (which it hitherto retaineth, for euery common Mariner calles it The Streight of <HI>Magellan</HI>) with an heroick and Herculean courage entred this &s;ea, which vncertaine it is, whether any &s;hippe before his had euer &s;temmed. For meditating a voyage to the i&s;les of the <HI>Moluccos,</HI> whereunto the Portugals v&s;ually &s;ailed from We&s;t to Ea&s;t; and intending to make thither a &s;horter cut from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, he came at length vnto them by this &s;ea: in one of which i&s;les called <HI>Machian,</HI> he was &s;laine in a skirmi&s;h. The cour&s;e of his voyage was this: Departing from <HI>Siuil</HI> with fiue &s;hips, whereof one being his owne, was called by a name of good pre&s;age <HI>Victoria,</HI> he came to the fortunate or <HI>Canary-i&s;les;</HI> then to the <HI>Gorgones</HI> or <HI>He&s;perides,</HI> now termed The i&s;les of <HI>Cape verde;</HI> and thence to the Streight abouenamed: which when he had found and pa&s;t thorow, he enters into this &s;ea; where with a fre&s;h and pro&s;perous gale hauing &s;ailed vpon the maine 40. dayes together, and beholding nothing but &s;ea on all &s;ides, and &s;till the &s;ea; when he had cro&s;&s;ed the South tropick he de&s;cried two &s;mall barren and vnhabited i&s;les: where notwith&s;tanding, becau&s;e they found good fi&s;hing, they &s;taied two dayes &amp; then departed, calling them the Vnfortunate i&s;les. Now, they are knowen by the name of <HI>Tuberones,</HI> and the i&s;les of <HI>S. Peter.</HI> Then he proceeds on his nauigation, &amp; in the &s;pace of 3. moneths and 20. dayes, hauing &s;ailed ouer this va&s;t Ocean 2400. leagues, he attained at length to the Aequinoctiall, and thence to the de&s;ired <HI>Molucces.</HI> And becau&s;e (as we haue &s;aid) he had for the mo&s;t part a pro&s;perous &amp; no tempe&s;tuous wind, he named this <HI>Pacificum</HI> or The peaceable &s;ea, now called by the common Mariner, The South &s;ea, or <HI>Mar del Sur.</HI> Tho&s;e that haue written of the New world, &s;ay, that this &s;ea about tho&s;e vnfortunate i&s;les, is mo&s;t exceeding deepe, and that neere vnto the coa&s;t of <HI>Per&uacute;</HI> it yeeldeth pearles, and that there are in it 7449. i&s;les, &s;o that &s;ome in our times not vnfitly haue called the We&s;tern part thereof <HI>Archipelagus</HI> or A &s;ea thicke &s;et with i&s;les: &s;eeing this, like the Aegean &s;ea (which is planted all ouer with the <HI>Cyclades,</HI> the <HI>Sporades,</HI> and many other i&s;lands, and is called in the Italian tongue <HI>Archipelago</HI>) is al&s;o with i&s;les mo&s;t nota|bly repleni&s;hed. In the bottome of this &s;ea <HI>Francis Vlloa</HI> and <HI>Antonie Digafetta</HI> do report, that there growes a weed of 14. or 15. fathoms high within the water; and that it ri&s;eth out of the water to the height of &s;ome 4. or 5. fathom: &s;o that &s;ometimes you &s;hall &s;eeme not to &s;aile thorow a &s;ea, but rather thorow a greene medow. The place of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his booke <HI>De Admirandis</HI> &amp;c. doth not much di&s;agree from this; where he writes of the Phoenicians which inhabited <HI>Gady|ra,</HI> that when they had &s;ailed a while without the pillars of <HI>Hercules,</HI> they arriued at certeine regions abounding with weeds and &s;lime, which were ouerflow|ed with the tides of the &s;ea. The very &s;ame affirmeth <HI>Iornandes</HI> in the beginning of his Geti&s;h hi&s;tory; where he writes, that none could &s;aile thorow the O|cean, being impa&s;&s;able in regard of weeds or turfs, and for that cau&s;e vnknowen. Yea <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Antigonus</HI> out of <HI>Mega&s;thenes</HI> haue left recorded, that all the Ea&s;t Ocean growes full of woods. And that the &s;ea neere <HI>Portugale</HI> &s;hould beare Okes laden with ma&s;t, <HI>Polybius</HI> reporteth in <HI>Athenaeus.</HI> Al&s;o, that the Bay-tree growes in the Red &s;ea, the &s;ame authour affirmes vpon the credit of <HI>Pythagoras.</HI> Hereunto you may adde that of <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> in his 4. booke of the hi&s;tory of Plants, <HI>cap.</HI> 7.8.9. and the te&s;timony of <HI>Aelianus, lib,</HI> 13. <HI>de Animal. cap.</HI> 3. and <HI>Strabo, lib.</HI> 16. and <HI>Plinie, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 103. <HI>lib.</HI> 6. <HI>cap.</HI> 22. and <HI>lib.</HI> 13. <HI>cap.</HI> 25. and <HI>Plu|tarch</HI> in his naturall que&s;tions concerning the face in the orbe of the Moone. All the&s;e are in &s;ome &s;ort confirmed by <HI>Platoes</HI> fables or hi&s;tories in his <HI>Timaeus</HI> concerning the i&s;le <HI>Atlantis;</HI> who&s;e &s;ea he affirmes to be vnnauigable by rea&s;on of the &s;lime or oaze remaining of the &s;ame i&s;les inundation. But concerning the &s;hip called <HI>La Victoria</HI> learne thus much: it is not &s;ayd ami&s;&s;e: <HI>Bare names oft times things named doe re&s;emble:</HI> Manife&s;t it is by this &s;hip, which vnder this happy name, the fir&s;t voyage that euer &s;he made, was the only &s;hip that caried away the victory of &s;ailing quite ouer the maine Ocean, for &s;o many ages before. For departing from <HI>Spaine,</HI> by the Streight of <HI>Magellan,</HI> to the <HI>Moluccos,</HI> thence hauing doubled the Cape of <HI>Buona E&s;peran&ccedil;a,</HI> and returned, whence &s;he fir&s;t put forth, &s;he was the fir&s;t of all &s;hips and inall ages, that euer circumpa&s;&s;ed the whole earth. The &s;ame &s;hip made out of <HI>Spaine</HI> a &s;econd voyage as farre as <HI>S. Domingo</HI> and home againe. Thither al&s;o &s;he made a third voyage; but in her returne &s;he was quite lo&s;t; neither was it euer knowen what became of her. Anti|quity would haue thought &s;he had beene taken vp into the skies, and placed among the Con&s;tellations, like another <HI>Argo.</HI> Nor had this propheticall ver&s;e of the peerele&s;&s;e Poet beene vnfitly alleged in her commendation: <HI>Then comes another</HI> Tiphys, <HI>another gold-fleeced</HI> Argo. Let <HI>Plinie</HI> now cea&s;e to maruell, that out of a &s;mall hemp-&s;eed &s;hould grow that, which was of force to cary vp and downe the globe of [his] earth. We in our age haue &s;eene with the very &s;ame thing this world of [ours, much greater than his] nauigated round about. Ours, I &s;ay: which that you may more perfectly vnder&s;tand, do but compare the fir&s;t Table of our Theatre with the fir&s;t of our Parergon or By-worke, and you &s;hall &s;ee the difference.</P>
<P>And here, I &s;uppo&s;e, I &s;hall not be&s;tow my labour altogether in vaine, by adding certaine particulars not commonly knowen, concerning the fir&s;t di&s;couery hereof. Which by all our late Writers is not vnworthily a&s;cribed to <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus.</HI> For in the yere 1492, he was the fir&s;t man that laid it open, &amp; made it knowen, and communicated the v&s;e and benefit thereof to the Chri&s;tian world. Howbeit I finde, that the North part of <HI>America</HI> (which lieth neere&s;t vnto <HI>Europe,</HI> and to &s;ome of our European i&s;les, namely, <HI>Groenland, I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Fri&s;land;</HI> and is called <HI>E&s;totiland</HI>) was long &s;ince di&s;couered by certaine Fri&s;landi&s;h fi&s;hers, driuen by tempe&s;t vpon that coa&s;t: and afterward about the yere 1390, that it was reui&s;ited anew by <HI>Antonie Zeno,</HI> a gentleman of <HI>Venice:</HI> and that by the authority of <HI>Zichmi,</HI> then King of the &s;aid i&s;le of <HI>Fri&s;land,</HI> a Prince in tho&s;e times very valiant, and ouer all that &s;ea, for his warres and victories mo&s;t re|nowmed. Concerning this his expedition there are extant in Italian certaine Collections or briefe extracts drawen by <HI>Francis Marcolino</HI> out of the letters of <HI>Nicolas</HI> and <HI>Antonie Zeno</HI> gentlemen of <HI>Venice,</HI> who liued in the&s;e parts. Out of which Collections I adde this that followes touching the de&s;cription of this region. <HI>E&s;totiland</HI> (he &s;aith) abounds with all things nece&s;&s;ary for mankind. In the mids therof &s;tands an exceeding high mountaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">That you many bet|ter vnder|&s;tand this relation, peru&s;e our Table of <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Scan|dia.</HI></NOTE> from whence i&s;&s;ue foure riuers that water the whole country. The inhabitants are witty, and mo&s;t expert in all kind of handicrafts. A language and letters they haue peculiar to them|&s;elues. Howbeit in this Kings Library there are certeine Latine books, no whit vnder&s;tood by them, which might perhaps before that time be there left by &s;ome of their European neighbors that had traffique with them. They haue all kinds of mettall, but &s;pecially gold, wherewith they mightily abound. They exerci&s;e trade of merchandize with the people of <HI>Greenland;</HI> from whence they fetch hides, pitch, &amp; brim&s;tone. The inhabitants &s;ay, that towards the South there are countries rich of gold, and repleni&s;ht with inhabitants. There are al&s;o many &amp; great woods; out of which they haue matter for the building of their &s;hips and cities; whereof and of fortre&s;&s;es there are great numbers. Of the load&s;tones v&s;e in nauigation they are vtterly ignorant. They al&s;o make mention of <HI>Drogeo,</HI> a region toward the South, inhabited by Canibals, and &s;uch as are delighted to eat mans fle&s;h; for want whereof, they liue with fi&s;hing, which they very much v&s;e. Beyond this there are large countries and another New world; but the inhabitants are barbarous, and go naked: howbeit again&s;t the cold of Win|ter they arme them&s;elues with bea&s;ts skinnes. The&s;e haue no kind of mettall: they liue by hunting. For weapons they v&s;e long and &s;harp-pointed &s;taues and bowes. They make warres one vpon another. Gouernours they haue, and lawes wherto they yeeld obedience. Southward of this place they liue in a more temperate climate, hauing cities and idol-temples, wherin they &s;acrifice liuing men, who&s;e fle&s;h they afterward deuoure. The&s;e haue the v&s;e of gold and &s;iluer. Thus much concerning this tract of land, out of the fore&s;aid collections or extracts; wherein this al&s;o is worthy the ob&s;eruation, that euen then our Europe|an Pilots by meanes of the load&s;tone &s;ailed tho&s;e &s;eas. For I am of opinion, that there is not to be found in any hi&s;tory a more ancient te&s;timony touching the fore&s;ayd v&s;e of this &s;tone. And the&s;e things I was the willinger to adioyne to this Table, becau&s;e I &s;ee none of them that haue written the hi&s;tories of the world &s;o much as once mention this matter.</P>
<P>But concerning the load&s;tone or &s;ea-compa&s;&s;e you are to vnder&s;tand, that the fir&s;t inuentour therof was <HI>Iohn Goia</HI> a citizen of <HI>Melfi,</HI> whom <HI>Alexander Sardus</HI> in his booke <HI>De inuentoribus rerum</HI> calleth <HI>Flauius Campanus.</HI> For &s;o write the Italians, and &s;o much is confirmed by <HI>Antonie Panormitanus</HI> in this one ver&s;e of his: <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Melfi <HI>Sailors taught, the load&s;tone how to v&s;e,</HI> and that in the yere of our Sauior 1300. This <HI>Melfi</HI> called <HI>Amalphis</HI> in Latine, is a towne &s;ituate vpon the &s;ea-&s;hore of <HI>Lucania. Goropius</HI> a&s;cribes the finding out of this &s;ecret to our Danes or Dutchmen; being per&s;uaded hereunto, becau&s;e the names of the 32. winds written vpon the compa&s;&s;e, are by all Pilots and Mariners, be they French, Spaniards, or of what nation &s;oeuer, expre&s;&s;ed in the Dutch tongue: which I confe&s;&s;e to be true, if you except the Italians only: for they both write and &s;peake of the&s;e winds in their owne mother-language. Howbeit &s;eeing all our na|uigatours of <HI>Europe,</HI> be they Spaniards, French, Engli&s;h, or Dutch, do expre&s;&s;e them in our language, I am verily of opinion, that as it was fir&s;t found and v&s;ed by the Amalfitans or Italians e&s;pecially within their owne Mediterran &s;ea: &s;o was the knowledge therof from them deriued vnto our Netherlanders, and mo&s;t of all to tho&s;e of <HI>Bruges;</HI> who&s;e city at that time (before all traff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">que was reduced to <HI>Antwerpe</HI>) was a famous mart-towne, and frequented by Italians, e&s;peci|ally of <HI>Venice,</HI> as the fore&s;aid <HI>Zeni</HI> report: and according to the te&s;timony of <HI>Peter Quirini, Chri&s;topher Fiorouanti,</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Michele,</HI> who in this our Ocean &s;uffered that horrible &s;hipwracke which we reade of in the Italian volumes: witne&s;&s;e al&s;o <HI>Lewis Cadamosta,</HI> who in his Epi&s;tles written about the yeere 1454, affirmes this city of <HI>Bruges</HI> to be a Mart inferiour to none el&s;e in all the North parts of the world. Wherefore, that the citizens of <HI>Bruges</HI> receiued the v&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the &s;ea-compa&s;&s;e from the Italians, and out of Italian tran&s;lated the names of the winds into their owne language, and that from them the other nations be|fore mentioned borrowed this knowledge, I &s;ee not well, how it may be denied. Of the nature and admirable vertue of the load&s;tone you may reade many notable things in <HI>Liuius Sanutus</HI> his de&s;cription of <HI>Africa,</HI> printed in Italian at <HI>Venice.</HI></P>

<P>_THis Prouince was about the yeere 1518 forcibly &s;ubdued to the Spani&s;h gouernment, vnder the command and conduct of <HI>Fer|nando Corlez:</HI> who with the great &s;laughter of his owne people, but farre greater of the inhabitants fighting for their liberty, con|quered the &s;ame. It is a region rich of &s;iluer and golde: for it hath very many riuers yeelding &s;ands or graines of perfect gold. Vpon the coa&s;t of this countrey are many commodious fi&s;hings for pearle. Salt lakes here are diuers, the water whereof through the heat of the Sunne is conuer|ted into excellent &s;alt. Here is great abundance of <HI>Ca&s;sia fi&s;tula,</HI> and a kind of fruit in the Mexican language called <HI>Cacao,</HI> &s;omewhat re&s;embling an Almond: which is with them very highly e&s;teemed; for hereof they make a kinde of drinke, to their owne ta&s;te mo&s;t delicate. The &s;eas and riuers belonging to this countrey abound mightily with fi&s;h. Their riuers al&s;o breed Crocodiles, who&s;e fle&s;h is food to the inhabitants. In the&s;e places this creature is for the mo&s;t part aboue twenty foot long. It is a countrey very mountainous and be&s;et here and there with mo&s;t lofty and cragged rocks. So great is the diuer&s;ity of languages in the&s;e regions, that one cannot vnder&s;tand another without an Interpreter. The principall Colonies to be &s;eene in this Table, which in <HI>New Spaine</HI> haue been planted by the Spaniards, are fir&s;t <HI>Compo&s;tella,</HI> the &s;eat of a Bi&s;hop, and of one of the Kings coun&s;els. <HI>Colima,</HI> by another name called the city of the Purification. <HI>Guadalajara,</HI> a towne mo&s;t fa|mous, and head of the Kingdome of <HI>New Gallicia. Mechoacan,</HI> a Bi&s;hops &s;ea al&s;o. <HI>Sacatula,</HI> the city of Angels, a mother-towne and a Bi&s;hoprick. <HI>Mexico,</HI> a Kingly city, or rather Queene of all the cities in the New world; &s;ituate vpon the banke of a lake, or rather of a fenne: yea the very ground-plot of this city is &s;o fenny, that you cannot come thither, nor depart thence but ouer bridges and caw&s;eys. The lake adioyning is &s;alt, being &s;ix leagues long and fiue broad. Fi&s;hes it hath none, but very &s;mall ones; which more aptly may be called wormes than fi&s;hes: of who&s;e putrefaction, which is there cau&s;ed by the heat of Summer, the aire is &s;ome|times &s;o infected, that it is mo&s;t vnhole&s;ome dwelling there: yet is it as much fre|quented with inhabitants and merchants, as any mart-towne in <HI>Europe.</HI> It is a large city; for in compa&s;&s;e it containeth about three leagues. The other lake adioining to this, is fre&s;h water, and very plentifull of fi&s;h; wherein al&s;o &s;tand many townes. There are likewi&s;e a great number vpon the banks of either lake. In this city (as <HI>Ierome Giraua</HI> reporteth) there was by Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the third e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;eat of an Archbi&s;hop, in the yeere 1547.</P>
<P>This citie was taken by the Spaniards 140 yeeres after the fir&s;t foundation thereof; <HI>Montezuma</HI> at the &s;ame time being King, the ninth in number. A won|der, how in &s;o few yeeres it &s;hould grow to &s;uch largene&s;&s;e and magnificence. The nature, &s;ituation, and cu&s;tomes of this citie and of the territory adiacent, who de&s;ires more perfectly to know, may reade the relations of <HI>Fernando Cortez.</HI> Ex|tant they are in the volume intituled <HI>Nouus orbis;</HI> and in the volume of Nauiga|tions printed at <HI>&V;enice</HI> in Italian: but e&s;pecially <HI>John Gon&s;aluo,</HI> who in his little booke of <HI>China</HI> hath a mo&s;t large de&s;cription of this region.

<HEAD>The Prouince of CVLIACAN.</HEAD>
<P>_THis Prouince of CVLIACAN is part of the kingdome of <HI>New Gali|cia.</HI> It was di&s;couered vnder the gouernment of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, in the yeere 1530. In this region is one only colonie of Spaniards called, The towne of <HI>S. Michael.</HI> Villages here are very many, built by the inhabi|tants; all which before the Spaniards arriuall were at their owne liber|tie: yeelding obedience to no King or Gouernour. The region is in|differently furni&s;hed with things nece&s;&s;ary. Out of the mountaines is digged great abun|dance of &s;iluer. The inhabitants are addicted to war and robbery. They that dwell vp|on the coa&s;t, employ mo&s;t of their time in fi&s;hing; but the vplandi&s;h people liue by hun|ting. They goe naked, couering only their priuities with a piece of Cotton. They haue many languages. They lodge for the mo&s;t part in the open aire. They are a mo&s;t beg|gerly nation.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CVBA and HISPANIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>_THis I&s;land of <HI>Cuba</HI> is &s;o called by the naturall inhabitants; but by the Spaniards <HI>Fernandina,</HI> and <HI>Joanna;</HI> and (as <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> reports) <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega.</HI> In length it extendeth Ea&s;t and We&s;t 300 Spani&s;h leagues: containing in bredth fifteene, and in &s;ome places twenty of the &s;aid leagues. The land is very moun|tainous, but rich of gold, and excellent copper. Madder, which the Apothecaries, becau&s;e it is very apt to die wooll and leather, call Diers-madder, is heere found in great abun|dance. It is in all places beautified with thicke woods, with riuers and pooles of fre&s;h wa|ter: albeit there are lakes naturally &s;alt. The woods breed vp Hogges and Kine in great plentie: the riuers &s;ometimes yeeld graines of gold. It containes &s;ix colonies or townes of Spaniards: the principall whereof called <HI>Sant Jago,</HI> is the &s;eat of a Bi&s;hop. But <HI>Hauana</HI> is the chiefe mart and hauen towne of all the I&s;le. Two wonderfull things <HI>Gon&s;aluo de Ouie|do</HI> de&s;cribes in this I&s;le: one, a valley extended betweene two mountaines &s;ome three Spani&s;h miles in length: (the Ancients would haue named it, as in <HI>Gallia Narbonen&s;i,</HI> now called <HI>Prouence, The &s;tony field</HI>) which bringeth forth round &s;tones in &s;o great abun|dance, that a man may lade whole &s;hippes with them, being by nature framed &s;o exactly round, that no Turner can amend them. The other is a mountaine not farre from the &s;ea, whereout i&s;&s;ueth a kind of Bitumen or Pitch in &s;o great a quantity, that it runnes into the &s;ea, and there floats farre and wide, according as it is carried by the waues or windes. This Pitch, they &s;ay, is very commodious for the calcking and braying of &s;hips.</P>
<P>HISPANIOLA lies to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Cuba.</HI> This I&s;le by the fir&s;t inhabitants was called <HI>Qui&s;quaeia,</HI> afterwards <HI>Haiti,</HI> and <HI>Cipanga</HI> likewi&s;e. But the Spaniards name it <HI>Hi|&s;paniola,</HI> and (of the principall city) <HI>San Domingo.</HI> The compa&s;&s;e hereof is 350 leagues. It is an I&s;le rich in Sugar, and it hath many Gold-mines. It is very &s;trange that is reported concerning a little flie very common in this I&s;land, called by the inhabitants <HI>Cucujo,</HI> and as big almo&s;t as one of the ioynts of a mans finger, hauing foure wings, two very thin, and the other two greater and harder, wherewith the thin ones are couered. This &s;hineth in the night as glowe-wormes doe with vs. The force of this light is not only in his eyes, &s;parckling like fire, but al&s;o in his &s;ides, &s;o that by lifting vp his wings, he &s;hines more fly|ing, than when he lies &s;till. By the naturall curte&s;ie of this little creature, all their cham|bers, they &s;ay, are &s;o light&s;ome euen in the darke&s;t nights, that a man may reade and write very plainly without the helpe of any other light. This light of theirs is augmented by their number; &s;o that many will giue a greater light than a few. Who&s;o de&s; res a larger de|&s;cription of the&s;e I&s;lands, let him reade the hi&s;tory of the New world written by <HI>Jerome Benzo, Peter Martyr</HI> his Decads of I&s;lands lately di&s;couered, and other writers of <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>_THe Spaniards diuide the South part of <HI>America</HI> into fiue regions, namely, <HI>The golden Ca&s;tilia, Popaian, Per&uacute;, Chili,</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il. Per&uacute;</HI> in times pa&s;t before the Spaniards comming thither was much larger, vnder the gouernment of the Ingas, than at this pre&s;ent, as <HI>Giraua</HI> and o|thers write. Now they confine it with <HI>Quito</HI> on the North, and with <HI>Puerto de Plata</HI> on the South. It was thus named from a riuer &amp; hauen named <HI>Per&uacute;.</HI> At this pre&s;ent they diuide it, according to the &s;ituation thereof, into three parts; into <HI>Sierras, Andes,</HI> and <HI>Plaines.</HI> The plaine countrey they call that which lieth next the &s;ea; <HI>Sierras</HI> are the mountaines; and <HI>Andes</HI> a region beyond the mountaines toward the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The head-city of this countrey of <HI>Per&uacute;</HI> is <HI>Lima,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>La ciadad de les Reges,</HI> where the Kings &s;eat, and the Chancerie of the whole Kingdome remaines. Al&s;o it is the &s;ea of an Archbi&s;hop, who vnder his iuri&s;diction hath the&s;e Bi&s;hopricks following; <HI>Quito, Cu&s;co, Guamanga, Arequipa, Paz, Plata, Trugillo, Guanuco, Chacapoia, Puerto viejo, Guajaquil, Popajan, Charchi, S. Michael,</HI> and <HI>S. Francis.</HI></P>
<P>That this is the riche&s;t of golde of all the countreys in the world, be&s;ides many other, the&s;e few arguments do euidently demon&s;trate. <HI>Francis Xeres</HI> writeth, that in <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> there were hou&s;es, who&s;e pauement, walles &amp; roofes were couered quite ouer with plates of golde. <HI>Giraua</HI> reports, that the inhabitants of the prouince <HI>Ancerna</HI> go to warres all armed in gold from head to foot: their habergions, their bre&s;t-plates, their leg &amp; thigh harne&s;&s;e, con|&s;i&s;t wholly of gold. The &s;ame authour affirmes, that out of certeine gold-mines neere <HI>Quito</HI> is digged more gold than earth. Tho&s;e that haue written the &s;torie of King <HI>Atabalipa,</HI> do agree in this, that he offered &s;o much golde to the Spaniards for his ran&s;ome, as the roome wherein he was pri&s;oner would containe. It was two and twenty foot long, and &s;euenteene foot broad: this he offered to fill &s;o high as he could reach vpon the wall with his longe&s;t finger; or if they thought better (marke al&s;o the infinite quantitie of &s;iluer in this region) he offered to fill it twi&s;e with &s;iluer euen to the very roofe. It is al&s;o recorded, that the Spaniards at their fir&s;t entrance vpon this countrey, &s;hod their hor&s;es with gold and &s;iluer &s;hoes.</P>
<P>This region in times pa&s;t was gouerned by Ingas (which word &s;ignifieth Kings, or &s;upreme Gouernours) of whom I finde this catalogue or pedegree in <HI>Simon Fernandez.</HI> The fir&s;t was MANGOCAPA; him the Peruuians denie to haue been borne of a man, &s;uppo&s;ing that he was made out of a certaine rocke, which is to be &s;eene nere <HI>Cu&s;co.</HI> This man of his wife <HI>Mama Guaco</HI> begat a &s;onne named SICHEROCA. He being more warlike than his father, &s;ubdued many bordering nations, and enlarged the limits of his Empire. Of his wife <HI>Mama Cura</HI> he had i&s;&s;ue LOCVCOPANGVE, the third Inga. This King thought it better to keepe that which his father had got, than with new conque&s;ts to augment his dominions. Being very aged he tooke to wife <HI>Mama Anauerque;</HI> which brought him forth a &s;onne, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, called MAYTACAPA. This &s;ucce&s;&s;or of his ioyned the prouince of <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> to his fathers Empire. Of his wife <HI>Mama Yacchidela</HI> he begat a &s;onne named CAPAC YVPANGVE who atchieued nothing worthy of memory. He had al&s;o by his wife <HI>Mama Cagna,</HI> a &s;onne called INGA RVCA. But neither did he in all his life any memorable act; &s;aue that he tooke to wife <HI>Mama Micay,</HI> of whon he begat many &s;onnes; concerning one of which named <HI>Yaguar Guacinga Iupangue,</HI> they report this &s;tory: Being a childe of three moneths old, he was conueyed away by a certain Cacique to be murdred; but while they were con&s;ulting whe|ther they &s;hould kill him, or no; it came to pa&s;&s;e that drops of bloud trickled from the infants weeping eyes: which they expounding as a matter prodigious, &s;urcea&s;ed their intent of murdering him. In the meane time be|ing found by a &s;tranger, and re&s;tored to his father, he proued a mo&s;t valiant and warlike Prince; in&s;omuch that he &s;ubdued many bordering nations.

Concerning the&s;e Ingas, and their memorable acts <HI>Pedro Cie&ccedil;a de Leon</HI> promi&s;ed a peculiar volume: whether he hath performed it I know not. Sufficeth thus much to haue been &s;poken of the Kings. Now let vs out of three worthy eye-witne&s;&s;es adde &s;omwhat concer|ning the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of the people. <HI>Ierome Benzo</HI> of <HI>Millan,</HI> who liued many yeeres in tho&s;e countries, in his booke of the New world dedicated to Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the fourth, writeth that the inhabitants of <HI>Per&uacute;</HI> are natu|rally indued with a more &s;harpe and &s;ubtile wit, than any other Indians &s;ubdued by the Spaniards. The &s;ame author (&s;peaking of them in another place;) Marke my words (&s;aith he:) I can by no meanes be induced to be|leeue that which &s;ome report of them; namely, that they are addicted to theft, and that by their lawes, the lea&s;t robberies de&s;erue hanging. But who can imagine them to be theeues, whenas they are neither couetous nor rich, e&s;teeming nothing more ba&s;e than &s;iluer &amp; gold? Of which, it they had a minde vnto the &s;ame, they might without controlment take as much as they would out of the Mines, like water out of the fountaine. Vnle&s;&s;e per|haps they haue learned of the Spaniards to play the thieues, who haue planted their colonies in that country, &amp;c. <HI>Bartholmew de las ca&s;as</HI> a Spaniard of the order of <HI>Dominick,</HI> and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chiapa,</HI> a great city of the New world, in that volume which he entitled <HI>The de&s;truction of the Indies,</HI> and dedicated to King <HI>Philip;</HI> he calleth them a peace|able, humble, gentle, and harmle&s;&s;e nation: and in another place, a &s;imple, plain-dealing people, void of all ma|lice, mo&s;t obedient and faithfull, not only to their owne naturall Princes, but al&s;o to Chri&s;tians that haue any command ouer them. And if there be any in all the world, then the&s;e are of a mo&s;t quiet di&s;po&s;ition, not giuen to brauling or tumults, nor greedy of reuenge. Frier <HI>Iodocus de Reijcke,</HI> by order a Franci&s;can, born in <HI>Mechilin,</HI> who in <HI>Quito</HI> a city of this region, erected the fir&s;t mona&s;tery of his order, writeth in his letters (which I my &s;elfe haue read) to the Guardian of the Franci&s;cans at <HI>Antwerpe:</HI> All the&s;e Indians (&s;aith he) thir&s;t after the Go&s;pell, and al|beit they are barbarous, and without learning, yet nature hath taught them an excellent kinde of gouernment, and behauior. Among them there was not a begger found, notwith&s;tanding they are all poore in food and ap|parell. And a little after; With the&s;e people was found &s;o great iu&s;tice and integrity of life, that therein they ex|cell euen tho&s;e which abound with books and learning. The &s;ame in another letter to the Friers of his order in <HI>Flanders:</HI> It is (&s;aith he) a witty, bold, and warlike nation, giuing vs hope of their ea&s;ie conuer&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, if they be not di&s;couraged therefrom by the Spaniards auarice. The&s;e letters, I thinke are not printed: The very originals of them, according to his &s;ingular humanity and fauor to the&s;e my &s;tudies were be&s;towed vpon me by the worthy citizen <HI>Adrian Mar&s;elar,</HI> Senatour of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> being the &s;aid <HI>Iodocus</HI> his kin&s;man by the mothers &s;ide.

In <HI>Lennox,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth <HI>Lelgouia, (Lelannonia,</HI> as I conceiue out of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> but I thinke our authour meant <HI>Selgouiae,</HI> which is farre from this place) there is a very great lake, which they call <HI>Loumond,</HI> aboue twenty foure miles long, and eight miles broad; It conteineth thirtie Ilands, where|of diuers haue villages well inhabited, with Churches and Chappels dedicated to the &s;eruice of Almighty God. In this three things are e&s;pecially worth the ob&s;eruation. For the fi&s;hes there, mo&s;t whole&s;ome and good, haue no &s;innes. The water oft times, when the winds are mo&s;t calme and &s;till, is &s;o boi&s;terous and rough, that it affraieth the be&s;t experienced watermen from putting forth to cro&s;&s;e the &s;ame: For the wind being alaied the boates are taken in their midde-cour&s;e, and are to&s;&s;ed with &s;uch danger, that except &s;ome com|modious hauen &s;hall fortune to be neere hand, many times they are ouerturned and ca&s;t away. La&s;tly, there is an iland in it, very good pa&s;ture for the feeding of cattell, which &s;wimmeth and moueth euery way as the winds driue. It is credibly reported, that there is a &s;tone which groweth in <HI>Argadia (Argathelia</HI> or <HI>Argile</HI>) which if it be couered but a while with &s;traw or flax, it will &s;et it on fire. At <HI>Slanis,</HI> a ca&s;tle in <HI>Buquhan,</HI> there is a caue of a &s;trange nature. For the water that droppeth into it in continuance of time is turned into a very white &s;tone; and if within a certaine number of yeares they &s;hould not be taken out, it would haue been long &s;ince filled vp with them. In this prouince there is no ratte euer &s;eene; and if &s;o be that any &s;hould be brought in thither, it will not by any meanes liue there. In the countrie of <HI>Fife</HI> great &s;tore of a kind of blacke &s;tone is digged out of the earth, (we call it &s;ea-coale) a mo&s;t excellent kind of fuell. At the mouth of the riuer <HI>Forth,</HI> in the maine &s;ea there is a very high rocke, out of who&s;e toppe a &s;pring of fre&s;h water, (a great miracle of nature) doth runne abundantlie. About two miles di&s;tant from <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> is a &s;pring, vpon the toppe of who&s;e water, dropps of oile, do continually &s;wimme, in &s;uch &s;ort, that if you take none from off it, there will be neuer the more: and if you take ought from thence, there will be neuer the le&s;&s;e. This oile is good again&s;t the roughne&s;&s;e of the skinne. Thus farre of the &s;trange thinges of this Realme. <HI>Scotland</HI> in the countrie of <HI>Dri&s;daile</HI> hath a mine of <HI>Gold,</HI> in the which al&s;o is found that which they commonly call <HI>Lazure.</HI> It hath al|&s;o mines both of Iron and Lead.</P>
<P>The inhabitants which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the South part, on this &s;ide the mount <HI>Grampius,</HI> are more ciuill and humane: and do &s;peake the En|gli&s;h tongue. Tho&s;e which dwell in the North parts, are a rough and more hard kind of people (they call them The wild-Scottes) and do weare mantles and skirts died with Saffron after the Iri&s;h fa&s;hion, and go barelegged. They &s;peake the Iri&s;h tongue. And as the Language of <HI>Scotland</HI> is of two &s;orts, &s;o are their maners as diuers. The&s;e <HI>Marianus Scotus</HI> calleth High-land-men, the other, I meane the wild-Scottes, they call Low-land-men.</P>
<P>The chiefe city of <HI>Scotland</HI> is <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> there is the kings &s;eat, and the ca&s;tle of Maidens, often mentioned in hi&s;tories. Saint <HI>An|drew,</HI> and <HI>Aberdon</HI> are two Vniuer&s;ities. The city <HI>Gla&s;ow</HI> is the Archbi&s;hops &s;ea. The towne of <HI>Perth,</HI> commonly called S. <HI>Iohns-toun,</HI> is the onely towne in <HI>Scotland</HI> that is walled about. Of the wood <HI>Caledon,</HI> (whereof <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and other ancient writers haue recorded.) There is &s;carcely any mention to be found, onely about the towne of <HI>Sterling,</HI> there remaineth &s;ome &s;hew of the name. Thus farre of the kingdome of <HI>Scotland:</HI> now it will not be ami&s;&s;e to &s;peake &s;omewhat of the ilands, that lie round about the &s;ame, and do belong vnto that crowne.</P>
<P>The HEBRIDES, (commonly called the <HI>We&s;t-iles,</HI>) both for bigne&s;&s;e and number do excell the re&s;t. <HI>Hector Bo&euml;thus</HI> &s;aith that they be in number 43. But heere he reckoneth vp the ile of <HI>Man</HI> as one of them, which is not &s;ubiect to the kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but is vn|der the allegeance of the King of <HI>England;</HI> neither do I thinke that it was euer accounted of the ancients among the <HI>Hebrides.</HI> The fir&s;t of the <HI>Hebrides</HI> is <HI>Aran,</HI> (otherwi&s;e called <HI>Bo&euml;th</HI>) then <HI>Hellaw</HI> and <HI>Rothes.</HI> Not farre from the&s;e is <HI>Alize,</HI> where are great plenty of Bar|nacles, which they call <HI>Soland-gee&s;e</HI> The greate&s;t of all and the mo&s;t famous is <HI>Ile,</HI> a fertile &s;oile for corne, and rich for veines of mettall. Then <HI>Cumber</HI> and <HI>Mule.</HI> Neere vnto the&s;e is <HI>Ione,</HI> memorable for the tombs of Kings long &s;ince buried there. Next vnto this is <HI>Lewis,</HI> la&s;t of all is <HI>Hirth</HI> &s;ituate in the 43. degree of latitude. Thus <HI>Boethus</HI> calleth them. But <HI>Iohn Maior</HI> the Scot nameth them thus, <HI>Argila, Aranea, Awyna, Butha,</HI> or <HI>Roth&s;aya,</HI> and <HI>Leui&s;ora.</HI> In the&s;e ilands are tho&s;e gee&s;e, which they call <HI>Clakes, (Gyraldus</HI> calleth them <HI>Berna|cles</HI>) which <HI>Bo&euml;thus</HI> affirmeth to breed of the &s;ea and of rotten wood; and not to grow vpon trees, as the common &s;ort beleeue and haue publi&s;hed in their writings. For if you &s;hall ca&s;t, &s;aith he, a peece of wood into that &s;ea, in continuance of time, fir&s;t wormes do breed within the wood, which by little and little become to haue heads, feet &amp; wings: at the la&s;t being fledge and growen to their full growth, to the bignes of a goo&s;e, they attempt to flie, and do &s;omtimes &s;wim and &s;ometimes v&s;e their wings as other Sea-foule do. Beyond the <HI>Hebrides,</HI> are the ORCHADES, (or the <HI>Orkeney iles,</HI>) of which the be&s;t is <HI>Pomona,</HI> famous for the Bi&s;hops-&s;ea, a goodly Church, and two &s;trong ca&s;tles. One of the&s;e <HI>Iohn Maior</HI> calleth <HI>Zeland,</HI> which is 50. miles in length. In the&s;e grow no manner of trees, nor any wheat, and yet otherwi&s;e of all other &s;orts of graine they are very fertile. It breedeth no &s;erpent or venimous bea&s;t. In <HI>Scotland</HI> they buy the barrell'd butter: the inhabitants hauing abundance of Barley whereof they make a mo&s;t &s;trong kind of drinke, and are very great drinkers; yet, as <HI>Bo&euml;thus</HI> &s;aith, you &s;hall neuer &s;ee a drunken-man, or madde man, one be&s;traught or a naturall foole among&s;t them. The &s;ame authour affirmeth the like of the inhabitants of the iles of <HI>Scetland:</HI> but this is no wonder, among&s;t them that drinke nought but water. All the wealth and commodities of the&s;e Scetland-men con&s;i&s;t in Stockfi&s;h, and hides of bea&s;tes. In the <HI>Hebrides</HI> they v&s;e the Iri&s;h tongue: in the iles of <HI>Orkeney</HI> they &s;peake the Gotti&s;h language. M. <HI>Iordanus</HI> in his mappe of <HI>Denmarke</HI> &s;aith that the <HI>Orchades</HI> are &s;ubiect to the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke:</HI> yet we know them to belong to <HI>Scotland</HI> vnder the title of a Dukedome.

<HEAD>Of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_THe South part of the Iland of <HI>Britaine,</HI> is, as we haue &s;aid before, diuided into two parts. That part which is toward the Ea&s;t, abutting vpon the German Ocean, is of the Angles, a peo|ple of the Saxons which &s;eated them&s;elues there, in their language called ANGLIA, or <HI>England,</HI> that is, the Angles land. The We&s;t part, which is &s;euered from that other by the riuers <HI>Seuern</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> and doth v&s;e the ancient Britti&s;h tongue, is of the &s;ame Angles or En|gli&s;hmen called, WALLIA or <HI>Wales:</HI> yet the Brittan or Wel&s;hman calleth him&s;elfe <HI>Cumro;</HI> and his country <HI>Cumria;</HI> the Engli&s;h <HI>Sai&s;&s;ons;</HI> and their country, <HI>Lho&euml;gria:</HI> neither do they know, or at lea&s;t they will not acknowledge, what <HI>England</HI> or an Engli&s;hman doth meane: So great difference there is betweene the languages of the &s;euerall nations of this Iland.</P>
<P>All this South part, <HI>England,</HI> I meane, and <HI>Wales,</HI> hath their proper king, vnto whom many Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earles, Barons and great Noblemen are &s;ubiect and obedient. It is a countrie at all times of the yeare mo&s;t kind and temperate. The Aire is thicke, and &s;o it is much &s;ubiect to windes, clowdes and raine: and therefore in regard of thickne&s;&s;e of the aire it is neither oppre&s;t with too much heat or too much cold. For it is found true by ex|perience that although it be more Northerly than <HI>Brabant, Flanders,</HI> and other forrein countries, yet heere the winter is neuer &s;o bitter nor the fro&s;t &s;o eger as in tho&s;e parts. It hath euerie where many hilles, (without wood and water,) which notwith&s;tanding do bring forth very &s;mall and &s;hort gra&s;&s;e, an excellent feed for &s;heepe: and therefore infinite flockes of &s;heepe do be&s;pread them, which either by rea&s;on of the kindne&s;&s;e of the aire, or goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, do yeeld mo&s;t &s;oft wooll farre finer than tho&s;e of other countries. And for that this country breedeth neither woolues nor any rauenous bea&s;t, you &s;hall &s;ee in diuers places flocks of &s;heepe vpon the hilles, and dales, greene pa&s;tures, commons, fallowes, and corne fields; into which after the crop is off, euery man, by a certaine ancient cu&s;tome doth put in his cattell in common, to wander heere and there without a &s;hepheard. This indeed is that <HI>Golden fleece,</HI> in which e&s;pecially the riches of the in|habitants doth con&s;i&s;t: for an huge ma&s;&s;e of gold and &s;iluer, is by Merchants, which thither flocke from all quarters for &s;uch like wares, yearly brought into the Iland, and there doth continually re&s;t, for that it is by proclamation forbidden that no man may carry any money out of the Realme. It aboundeth al&s;o with all &s;orts of cattell, except a&s;&s;es, mules, ca|mels, and elephants. There is in no place of the world greater and larger dogges, nor better.</P>
<P>The &s;oile is very fatte and fertile, and naturally bringeth foorth, be&s;ide all &s;orts of corne and pul&s;e, all maner of things, onely the firre-tree, and, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aith, the beech tree, although that now it hath in diuer&s;e places plenty of beeches. The ay-green Bay tree doth in the&s;e Northren countries no where thriue better. Such abundance of Ro&s;emary heere doth grow in all places and that &s;o high, that they oft times do fence their gardens therewith. Wine they haue none, for the grapes &s;eldome heere do ripen, and is among&s;t them planted rather for &s;hade and plea&s;ure, then for his fruit and profit. There is in no country in Chri&s;tendome more Crowes than heere, a kind of fowle very harmefull: for it doth not onely &s;poile the ripe and &s;tanding corne, but a&s;&s;oone as it is &s;hotte they will &s;tocke and digge it vp with their billes, &s;o that the husbandmen are faine at that time of the yeare to &s;et Boies in the fields with bow and arrowes (for they are not afraid of mens voices) to skarre them away.</P>
<P>The Ocean or maine &s;ea, which beateth vpon the coa&s;t of this Iland, aboundeth with all maner of Fi&s;h: of which the <HI>Lucius,</HI> or <HI>Pike,</HI> as they commonly call it, they e&s;teeme as a deinty di&s;h, and therefore they oft take it out of fenny pooles and riuers, and put it into their fi&s;hponds and weares; where being purged and cleared from that muddy &s;auour, feed with eeles and other little fi&s;hes, he groweth exceeding fatte and of a hole&s;ome and plea&s;ing ta&s;t. This fi&s;h (which is a very &s;trange thing) being brought aliue into the fi&s;hmarket to be &s;old, they open his belly with a knife, to &s;hew how fatte he is: if he be not &s;old, yet of that wound he dieth not, but the &s;litte being &s;ewed vp, and pre&s;ently put into the pond, a|mong&s;t the &s;limie tenches, it is by and by healed againe. There are no where in all the world either more daintie Oi&s;ters, or greater &s;tore.</P>
<P>It yeeldeth al&s;o Gold, Siluer, Copper, and Iron, although no great quantitie of either &s;ort: but of Lead, and Tinne, (the Latines call that <HI>Plumbum nigrum,</HI> this <HI>Plumbum album</HI>) in their kind the be&s;t, is heere found in great abundaunce, and from thence is tran&s;ported to forrein nations.</P>
<P>The people are tall of &s;tature, well fauoured and faire countenanced, for the mo&s;t part gray eied, and as in maner of pro|nunciation they much re&s;emble the Italian, &s;o in proportion and feature of body and maners they little or nothing differ from them. They &s;hape their apparell much-what after the French fa&s;hion. The women mo&s;t faire and beautifull, do go very decently and comlily attired. They feed mo&s;t-what on fle&s;h. The drinke which they v&s;e, and do make of malt, is indeed very good, hole&s;ome and plea&s;ant; much &s;ought after in the Low countries, and therefore conueied thither in great abundance. At their meales both dinners and &s;uppers they fare well, daintilie, liberallie, and are very merrie and plea&s;ant. In warre they are courageous and hardie, good archers, and cannot abide delaies and lingring; and therefore when they ioine battell and come to blowes, one part &s;hall &s;oone be vtterly ouerthrowne, for the conqueror &s;ei&s;eth all in|to his hands. They build no Ca&s;tles; yea tho&s;e which their aunce&s;tours haue built in former ages, and now are decaied, ruinous and readie to fall, they care not for the reedifying and vpholding of them. Cities they haue, and many faire townes, goodly hamlets, &s;treets, and villages. The chiefe City, mart-towne, and imperiall &s;eat of their Kinges is LON|DON, &s;ituate vpon the riuer of <HI>Thames:</HI> ioined with a faire &s;tone bridge of twenty piles, very goodly arched. Vpon this bridge are hou&s;es &s;o built on ech &s;ide, that it &s;eemeth almo&s;t to be a continuall &s;treet, not a bridge. This of the nature of the &s;oile, temperature of the aire, manners and behauiour of the people, we haue for the mo&s;t part gathered out of <HI>Poly|dore Virgill</HI> his hi&s;torie of <HI>England:</HI> for he hath very curiou&s;ly there de&s;cribed this Iland. In <HI>England</HI> the&s;e things are fa|mous and worth the ob&s;eruation, as this ver&s;e &s;heweth, <HI>Mons, &amp; fons, &amp; pons, eccle&s;ia, femina, lana:</HI> Of riuers, and moun|taines, &s;tone bridges and wooll: Faire women, and Churches, <HI>England</HI> is full.</P>
<P>IRELAND, is &s;ubiect to the crowne of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o are diuers other le&s;&s;er iles, as <HI>Wight, Man, Angle&s;ey,</HI> (the ancient &s;eat of the Druydes, the Wel&s;hmen call it, <HI>Tirm&ocirc;n mam Gumry, Man</HI> the mother of <HI>Wales,</HI> the Latines, this MONA, that other MENAVIA) and tho&s;e which now we call the <HI>Sorlinges</HI> (the Greeks called them CASSITERIDES.) <HI>Gern&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Ger&s;ey</HI> with other &s;mall ilands about them, although they be hard vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> yet they do belong vnto <HI>Eng|land. Humfrey Lhoyd</HI> hath &s;o curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed <HI>England</HI> together with the Antiquities thereof, that others before him may iu&s;tlie &s;eeme to be accu&s;ed of great negligence. Him did <HI>Alexander Neuill</HI> follow in his hi&s;torie of the Rebellion in <HI>Norffolke,</HI> which he intituleth <HI>Norwicus. Daniel Rogers</HI> my kin&s;man hath written a booke of the maners, lawes and cu|&s;tomes of the ancient Brittans.

<P>_THe di&s;cour&s;e of this prouince, we haue compo&s;ed out of a certaine fragment of our &s;ingular good friend <HI>Humfrey Lhoyd,</HI> which not long &s;ince wee cau&s;ed <HI>Birkman</HI> to imprint, for the benefit of tho&s;e that are &s;tudents of Geography. CAMBRIA, &s;aith he, the third part of <HI>Britaine,</HI> is diuided from <HI>Lho&euml;gria,</HI> (or <HI>England</HI> if you plea&s;e &s;o to call it) by the riuers <HI>Seuern</HI> and <HI>Dee,</HI> otherwi&s;e it is on all parts confined with the Iri&s;h &s;ea (the Geographers commonly call it <HI>Oceanus Vergiuius</HI>) it was &s;o named (as they dreame) of <HI>Camber,</HI> the third &s;onne of <HI>Brute.</HI> The Wel&s;hmen call it <HI>Cymri,</HI> the Engli&s;h <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Latin WALLIA. This part only of this whole Britti&s;h iland doth &s;til enioy the mo&s;t an|cient inhabitants being indeed the true naturall Brittans: and do yet retaine the Britti&s;h tongue, and cannot &s;peake one word of Engli&s;h, which is a language made e&s;pecially of the mi&s;ture of the Dutch and French tongues. <HI>Wales</HI> they do at this time diuide into three prouinces, <HI>Venedoth, Powis-land,</HI> and <HI>Dehenbarth.</HI> Vnder <HI>Venedoth</HI> the ile <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> (famous long &s;ince, and accounted for the ancient &s;eat of the <HI>Druides,</HI>) is conteined. The inhabitants in cour&s;e of life and fa&s;hion of apparell do follow the Engli&s;h: and are an idle people not willing to labour or take pains, bragging much of their gentilitie, and do giue them&s;elues rather to the &s;eruice of Noblemen and to follow the court, than to trades and occupations. Heere hence it is that you &s;hall find few Noblemen through out all <HI>England,</HI> which hath not the greate&s;t part of his followers &amp; &s;eruants (in which thing Engli&s;hmen do &s;urpa&s;&s;e any other nation what&s;oeuer) Wel&s;hmen borne: for being men that are fed with whitmeats or butter &amp; chee&s;e, they haue nimble &amp; able bodies, fit for any maner of &s;eruice. Moreouer being men of haughty minds, and in extreme penury and beggery challenging vnto them&s;elues to be nobly de&s;cended, they delight rather to go brauein apparell (like vnto the Spaniard) then to get goods or pamper their bellies, and do &s;oone learne courtlike behauiour, and therefore they are of the Engli&s;h Nobility for &s;er|uice preferred before the Engli&s;h. Yet of late heere they haue v&s;ed them&s;elues to dwell in cities, to learn occupations, to trade as merchants, to go to plough, and to do any maner of bu&s;ine&s;&s;e good for the common-wealth as well as the En|gli&s;h: nay in this thing they excell them, that there is no man &s;o poore among&s;t them, but for a while will &s;et his &s;onnes to &s;chole to learne to write and read, and tho&s;e whom they find to be apt, they &s;end to the Vniuer&s;ities, &amp; cau&s;e them for the mo&s;t part to giue their minds to the &s;tudy of the ciuill law: Heere hence it is that the greater part of tho&s;e, which in this kingdome doe profe&s;&s;e the Ciuill or Canon law, are Wel&s;hmen borne. You &s;hall find al&s;o very few of the common and meaner &s;ort of people but can read and write his owne language, and after their fa&s;hion play vpon the Wel&s;h harpe. Now al&s;o they haue the Bible, and common praier booke printed in their owne tongue, a language, as we &s;aid, v&s;ed of their ance&s;tors and wholly different from the Engli&s;h. And as in old time long &s;ince be|ing a people (as <HI>Tacitus</HI> reporteth) impatient of the lea&s;t wrongs that might be offered, they were alwaies together by the eares and cutting one anothers throates; &s;o now for feare of law, (to which they are more obedient, then any other nation) they will wrangle and contend one with another, as long as they are worth a groate. The&s;e few ob&s;eruations we haue gleaned out of <HI>Lhoyd,</HI> to whom we &s;end the Reader that de&s;ireth more of the particulars of this country. <HI>Sylue|&s;ter Gerrard,</HI> a Wel&s;hman hath de&s;cribed <HI>VVales</HI> in a &s;euerall treati&s;e. Read al&s;o the Iournall of <HI>VVales.</HI> Moreouer <HI>VVilliam</HI> of <HI>Newbery</HI> in the 5. chap. of his 2. booke hath many things of the nature of this country, &amp; maners of the people. To the&s;e you may adioine <HI>Polyd. Virg.</HI> &amp; tho&s;e things which <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> hath written in the &s;umme of his 2. booke, <HI>de re Gallica.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Cymri,</HI> or (as the Engli&s;h call it) <HI>VVales</HI> belongeth (that we may heere by the way &s;ay &s;omething of this) by an ancient decree, to the King of Englands elde&s;t &s;onne, or daughter if he faile, to the Kings heire, I meane, who is to &s;uc+ceed next after him: and he is called a&s;&s;oone as he is born, <HI>The Prince of VVales:</HI> and that in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, as in <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Portugall</HI> they call the Kings heire, The Prince; and in <HI>France,</HI> The Dolphin.</P>
<P><HI>Ieffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> writeth, that in the&s;e parts of <HI>VVales</HI> neere the riuer of <HI>Seuern,</HI> there is a poole which the country peo|ple call, <HI>Linligune.</HI> This, &s;aith he, when the &s;ea floweth into it, enterteineth the waters like a bottomle&s;&s;e gulfe, and &s;o drinketh vp the waues that it is neuer full, nor euer runneth ouer. But when the &s;ea ebbeth, the waters which before it had &s;wallowed do &s;well like a mountaine, which then do da&s;h and run ouer the banks. At which time if all the people of that &s;hire &s;hould &s;tand any thing neere the poole, with their faces toward it, &s;o that the water &s;hall but da&s;h into their clothes and apparell, they &s;hall hard be able to auoid the danger, but that they &s;halbe drawne into the poole. But if ones backe &s;halbe toward it, there is no danger at all, although he &s;hould &s;tand vpon the very edge of the &s;ame. This is the &s;tory, I haue nam'd the authour, let him approue the truth of the &s;ame. Of <HI>Mona</HI> the iland vpon the &s;hore of this country thou ha&s;t the opinion of <HI>Humfrey Lhoyd</HI> in his epi&s;tle which we haue adioined to the end of this booke. Of this al&s;o <HI>Iohn Leland</HI> in his <HI>Genethliacon</HI> of <HI>Edward</HI> Prince of <HI>VVales,</HI> thus writeth: <HI>This Iland &s;aith hee, being conquered by the Engli&s;h, changed the name, and was called</HI> Angle&s;ey, <HI>that is; the iland of Engli&s;hmen.</HI> Polydore Virgill, <HI>a man of great reading, and good iudgement in many matters, is of another opinion. Hee laboureth with all his forces to proue</HI> Menauia <HI>to be</HI> Mona. <HI>If the name, which yet it retaineth: If the citie</HI> Caernaruon, <HI>which is ouer again&s;t it vpon the maine, do take his denomination from hence and is called</HI> Aruon <HI>for</HI> Ar-mon: <HI>If that &s;ame very &s;hort cut ouer, of which the Roman writers do &s;peake: If the ne&s;&s;e or promontorie</HI> Pen-mon, <HI>that is, as the word &s;ignifieth, The head of</HI> Mon: <HI>If the huge bodies of trees, and rootes couered ouer with &s;and, which daily are digged out of the &s;hore of</HI> Tir-mon: <HI>If the firre-trees of maruailous length, which in &s;qually grounds are heere and there found within the earth in this Iland, do not &s;ufficiently proue that that was anciently called</HI> Mona, <HI>which now we call</HI> Angle&s;ey, <HI>I know not what to &s;ay more then that I haue read this in the</HI> 14. <HI>booke of</HI> Cornelius Tacitus <HI>his Annales,</HI> Exci&s;i&abque; luci &s;aeuis &s;uper&s;titionibus &s;acri, &amp;c. <HI>Felling the woods con&s;ecrated to &s;uper&s;titious &s;eruices, &amp;c.

<HEAD>IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P>_IRELAND, which the Greekes and Latines call HIBERNIA, others IVERMA and IERNA, the Iri&s;h them|&s;elues call <HI>Eryn.</HI> From hence &s;trangers, taking it from the mouth of the Engli&s;h, which pronounce <HI>e,</HI> the &s;econd vowell with the &s;ame &s;ound that other nations do &s;ound <HI>i,</HI> the third vowell, haue made, as it &s;eemeth <HI>Irynlandt,</HI> compounded, as is apparent, of the Iri&s;h <HI>Erin,</HI> and the Saxon or Dutch <HI>Landt,</HI> which after|ward was contracted, for more commodity of &s;peach and roundne&s;&s;e of pronunciation, into <HI>Irland,</HI> from whence the Latines framed IRLANDIA. The fir&s;t inhabitants which &s;eated them&s;elues in this Iland came hither, as may be ea&s;ily demon&s;trated from <HI>Brittaine</HI> or <HI>England,</HI> not from <HI>Spaine,</HI> as &s;ome mo&s;t ab&s;urdly haue written. For the abridgement of <HI>Strabo</HI> doth flatly call the&s;e ilanders, <HI>Britaines:</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;aith that <HI>Irin</HI> is a part of <HI>Britaine:</HI> wherefore it was iu&s;tly of all old writers called, INSVLA BRITANNIA, One of the Britti&s;h iles. About the yeare of CHRIST, 400. in the daies of <HI>Honorius</HI> and <HI>Arcadius</HI> the Em|perours, at what time the Roman Empire began to decline, the Scottes, a &s;econd nation entered <HI>Ireland,</HI> and planted them&s;elues as <HI>O|ro&s;ius</HI> writeth, in the North parts, whereupon it was of them called, SCOTLAND. <HI>Sylue&s;ter Gyraldus Cambren&s;is</HI> about 400. yeares &s;ince de&s;cribed this Iland in a &s;euerall treati&s;e. But becau&s;e that this booke as yet is not &s;et forth and therefore not common and euery where to be gotten, we will out of it gather &s;o much as this narrow roome may conteine, not doubting but we &s;hall worthily de&s;erue great thankes at the readers hand for the &s;ame. Li&s;ten therefore to his words:</P>
<P><HI>Ireland,</HI> next after <HI>England</HI> the greate&s;t Iland of the knowne world, hath the greater <HI>Britaine</HI> vpon his Ea&s;t &s;ide, vpon the We&s;t on|ly lieth the va&s;t and wide Ocean; on the North three daies &s;aile from the coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland</HI> lieth <HI>I&s;land,</HI> of all the Northren iles by far the greate&s;t. <HI>Britaine</HI> is almo&s;t twice as great as <HI>Ireland:</HI> for &s;eeing that the length of both runneth the &s;ame way from South to North; that is, about 800. miles long, and about 200. miles broad: this from <HI>Brendam</HI> hilles to the iles <HI>Columbine</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Thorach,</HI> is about eight daies iourney, that is 400. miles long at the lea&s;t. <HI>Ireland</HI> conteineth in all 176. Canweds. The word <HI>Canwed</HI> is a compound word, v&s;ed a&s;well of the Welch as Iri&s;h, and &s;ignifieth a circuite of ground conteining within it 100. villages.</P>
<P>The &s;oile of <HI>Ireland</HI> is vneuen, full of hilles and dales, &s;oft and &s;qually, full of woods, bogges and fennes. Vpon the toppes of the highe&s;t and &s;teepe&s;t hilles you &s;hall oft find great ponds and bogges: yet it hath in &s;ome places mo&s;t goodly plaines and champion, but in re&s;pect of the woods they are very little. The ground is very fatte, and fertile for Corne. The mountaines abound with &s;heepe, the woods are full of Deere: and the whole ile generally is better for pa&s;ture, then for eareable ground, much better I meane, for gra&s;&s;e then corne. For the kernelles of wheat are heere &s;o dwined and &s;mall, that they may hardly be dre&s;&s;ed with any manner of fanne. That which the Spring-time doth bring forth and flouri&s;heth for a while in Summer, the dripping and watery Autumne will hardly &s;uffer kindly to ripen or tidily to be inn'd. For this Iland is more &s;ubiect to blu&s;tering winds, outragious &s;tormes of raine and floods, then any other country vnder the cope of heauen. It is very rich of honie and milke. <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>I&s;idore</HI> affirme that it hath no Bees: but by their leaue if they had more diligently examined the matter, they might haue on the contrarie written, that it wanteth vines, but is not altogether void of Bees. For this Iland neither now hath, nor euer had any vines: But of Bees it hath, (as any other country) great plenty: which notwith&s;tanding would heere, as I thinke, &s;warme in farre greater number, if it were not for the venemous and &s;owre ewgh-trees which in all places of the Iland do grow in great abundance.</P>
<P>The Iland is euery where cro&s;&s;ed and watered with many goodly riuers; of which the principall are the&s;e: <HI>Auenli&s;&s;,</HI> runneth by <HI>Dublin: Boand</HI> (or <HI>Boine</HI>) through <HI>Methe: Banna,</HI> through <HI>Vl&s;ter: Linne,</HI> by <HI>Connagh: Moad,</HI> by <HI>Kenelcunill, Slechey,</HI> and <HI>Samayr: Mo|darn</HI> and <HI>Furne,</HI> by <HI>Keneleon:</HI> There are al&s;o very many other riuers, whereof &s;ome i&s;&s;uing forth of the bowels of the earth and from their cleare fountaines, other immediatly ru&s;hing forth of lakes and fennes wandring heere and there diuide and part the Iland into ma|ny goodly prouinces and &s;hires. For vnder the foot of <HI>Bladina</HI> hill (now called <HI>Bliew Blemy</HI>) three famous riuers do ari&s;e, commonly called, <HI>The three Si&s;ters,</HI> (for they beare the names of three &s;i&s;ters:) <HI>Berne, (Birgus,</HI> now <HI>Barrow</HI>) which runneth by <HI>Lechlin: Eoyr, Ne|orus,</HI> they call it <HI>Nore,</HI> by <HI>O&s;sire:</HI> and <HI>Swyre,</HI> by <HI>Archfine</HI> and <HI>Trebagh;</HI> neere <HI>Waterford</HI> they kindly &s;alute one another, and &s;o falling into one channell they quietlie toward the &s;ea. <HI>Slane,</HI> runneth by <HI>Wexford: Boand,</HI> by <HI>Meath: Auenmore,</HI> by <HI>Li&s;more:</HI> and <HI>Simen,</HI> by <HI>Limiricke.</HI> And indeed among&s;t all the riuers of <HI>Ireland, Sinnen</HI> bear'th the bell, not only for his goodly greatne&s;&s;e, long and diuers wandrings through the country, but al&s;o his great plenty of dainty fi&s;h. For it ari&s;eth out of a very large and goodly lake, which diui|deth <HI>Connagh</HI> from <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and &s;preadeth it &s;elfe into two branches running two contrary waies: one of them tending toward the South, pa&s;&s;eth by the city <HI>Kelleloe,</HI> and then enclo&s;inge round the citie <HI>Limiricke,</HI> with a direct cour&s;e and large &s;treame for an hundred miles and vpward, running between the two mountaines, emptieth it &s;elfe into the <HI>Brendan</HI> &s;ea. The other not much le&s;&s;e then the for|mer, diuiding <HI>Meath</HI> and the farther parts of <HI>Vl&s;ter</HI> from <HI>Connagh,</HI> running with a crooked cour&s;e turning this way and that way, at la&s;t hideth it &s;elfe in the Northren ocean: So that this riuer doth &s;eparate the fourth and We&s;t part of the Iland from the other three, like a midland &s;treame running from &s;ea to &s;ea. For this Iland in former ages was diuided almo&s;t into fiue equall parts, namely into <HI>North Moun&s;ter, South Moun&s;ter, Lein&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Connagh.</HI></P>
<P>This country hath diuers goodly Lakes. The &s;ea coa&s;t aboundeth plentifully with all maner of &s;ea-fi&s;h on all &s;ides: the Riuers and Lakes are &s;tored with great variety of fre&s;h-fi&s;hes: e&s;pecially with the&s;e three &s;orts, Salmons, Trouts, and Eeles. The riuer <HI>Shynen</HI> &s;warmeth with Lampreyes. But there are wanting many other &s;orts of good fre&s;h-fi&s;h of other countries, as Pikes, Perches, Gogeons, and almo&s;t &s;uch fi&s;h as come not from the &s;ea or &s;alt waters. On the contrary the Lakes of this Iland haue three kinds of fi&s;h, which are no where els to be found. For they are &s;omewhat longer and rounder then Trouts, very white fle&s;hed, pa&s;&s;ing &s;auery and plea&s;ant, very like vnto the <HI>Hallibut, (Vmbra</HI> our authour calleth it) but that they are much bigger headed. There is another kind very like to herrings, a&s;well for proportion and bigne&s;&s;e, as al&s;o for colour and ta&s;t. There are a third &s;ort, in all points like trouts, but that they are not &s;potted. Yet the&s;e &s;orts of fi&s;h are only &s;een in the Summer, in the Winter they neuer appeare. In <HI>Meath,</HI> neere <HI>Foner</HI> are three Lakes not farre di&s;tant one from another, ech of which hath certaine fi&s;h proper to it &s;elfe, not found in any of the other two; neither do they I meane, euer come one at another, although there be mo&s;t conuenient pa&s;&s;ages by rea&s;on of the riuer which runneth from one to another: nay if it &s;hall chance that the fi&s;h of one lake be caried to another, either it dieth within a while after, or returneth vnto his own lake againe.</P>
<P>This Iland breedeth greater &s;tore of Falcons, Hobbies, and &s;parrow-hawkes, then any other countrie what&s;oeuer. Heere Eagles are as common, as kites are in other countries: and they flocke together in &s;uch companies, that oft times you &s;hall find an hundred in one companie. Heere are al&s;o great &s;tore of tho&s;e fowles which they call <HI>Bernacles,</HI> which nature bringeth forth in a &s;trange and woonder|full maner: they are like the wild goo&s;e, but &s;omewhat le&s;&s;e. For they are bredde of the firre blocks, which are to&s;&s;ed along by the &s;hore in this maner: Fir&s;t vpon the blocks you &s;hall &s;ee as it were a certaine gelly: then the reeds and other &s;ea-weeds &s;taying the logges, being inclo&s;ed in &s;hels, (for the better fa&s;hioning and &s;afe pre&s;eruing of them) they hang by the billes, vntill in proce&s;&s;e and continuance of time they wax of a competent bigne&s;&s;e, and be couered with feathers, either they fall into the water, or by the benefit of their wings they lift vp them&s;elues aloft into the open aire. I my &s;elfe haue many times and often &s;eene with the&s;e &s;ame eies many very &s;mall bodies, of the&s;e kind of birds hanging vpon on blocke on the &s;ea coa&s;t, enclo&s;ed in &s;hells and fully fa&s;hioned. The&s;e tread not as other fowles do, they ley no egges, they neuer &s;itte. And therefore in certaine places of <HI>Ireland</HI> in Lent and vpon other fa&s;ting daies, it is lawfull to eat the&s;e fowles, as if they were not fle&s;h, nor come of fle&s;h. There are al&s;o heere great &s;tore of a kind of fowle of a doubtfull &s;hape, or dou|ble nature, which they call an <HI>Aurifri&s;e,</HI> le&s;&s;e then an Eagle, but greater then a hawke, hauing vpon one foot &s;harp talants, clouen and griping: the other whole footed, not made to cletch or carry any thing, but only fit for &s;wimming; a &s;trange and admirable worke of &s;porting nature. Heere are certein birds which they call Martiners, le&s;&s;e then a blacke bird, cut tail'd like quails, but differing from them in this that their bellies are white and their backs blacke. A &s;trange thing it is to tell of the&s;e birds: that if they being dead &s;halbe kept

<PB REF="34"> in a drie place, they will neuer &s;tinke: and being laid among&s;t apparell or other woollen things they will keepe them &s;afe from the moth. And that which is much more admirable, being dead and hang'd vp in &s;ome drie place, euery yeare they &s;hed their old feathers, and new come vp in their &s;tood. In the North part of <HI>Ireland</HI> they haue great &s;tore of Swans. Storks through out all the Ile are very rare, and tho&s;e which they haue are blacke. They haue no Partridges, Phe&s;ants, Magge-pies nor Nightingales. It hath almo&s;t all kind of wild bea&s;ts. The Stagges beere are &s;o fatte, that they are &s;carcely able to runne: and tho&s;e which are the lea&s;t among&s;t them in bigne&s;&s;e of body, do excell others in &s;tateline&s;&s;e and goodly branching of their hornes. We neuer in any place &s;aw greater plenty of Bores. They haue al&s;o many hares, badgers, and wea&s;ils. The bodies of their cattell, bea&s;ts, deere, and fowles, are in their kind le&s;&s;e then in other places. Hallow deere, goates and hedgehogs they haue none at all; as al&s;o Moles, or if any, they are very rare: but of mice they haue &s;uch infinite plenty, as no where more. Of wolues and foxes they haue many; but no maner of venemous creatures. For the Spiders and Nents heere are neither venemous nor hurtfull. The country is neuer &s;haken with Earth-quakes, and &s;carce once in a yeare &s;hall on heare it thunder.</P>
<P>From the&s;e naturall things let vs pa&s;&s;e vnto tho&s;e &s;trange wonders which nature worketh in the&s;e out-countries of the world. In North <HI>Moun&s;ter</HI> there is a lake wherein are two Ilands, a greater and a le&s;&s;e: the greater hath a Church, the le&s;&s;er a Chappell. Into the Greater neuer any woman, or liuing creature of the female kind might euer come, but it would die by and by. This was often proued by bitches, cattes, and other creatures of that &s;ex. In the le&s;&s;er no man did euer die, or could die of a naturall death. In <HI>Vl&s;ter</HI> there is another Lake in which there is an Iland of two diuers qualities; one part of it hauing a church con&s;ecrated to the &s;eruice of Chri&s;tianity is very beautifull, goodly and plea&s;ant. The other very rough, ouer growne and vnplea&s;ant, is &s;aid to be bequeathed to Diuels and euill &s;pirits. This part hath in it nine caues or trenches, in any of which if a man do chance to &s;leepe all night, he is pre&s;ently a&s;&s;aulted by the euill &s;pirits, and all the night &s;o greeuou&s;ly tormented and vexed, that by the morning hee &s;hall &s;carce be able to breath and will be almo&s;t halfe dead. This place is called of the country people, <HI>The purgatory of S. Patricke.</HI> There is al&s;o a &s;pring or fountaine in <HI>Moun|&s;ter,</HI> with who&s;e water if any man &s;hall wa&s;h him&s;elfe, he will pre&s;ently become hoary or gray-headed. I my &s;elfe &s;aw a man who wa|&s;hed the one halfe of his beard with this water, and the haire became white, the other remaining blacke as it was before. On the con|trary there is in <HI>Vl&s;ter</HI> a fountaine, in which if any man wa&s;h his haire, he &s;hall neuer be horay or gray-headed. In <HI>Connagh</HI> there is a fountaine of fre&s;h water vpon the toppe of a very high mountaine, which ebbeth twi&s;e in 24. houres, and floweth as oft, in this imita|ting the vncon&s;tant motion of the &s;ea. There is a fountaine in the farder and North part of <HI>Vl&s;ter,</HI> which by rea&s;on of the great cold|ne&s;&s;e of it, in &s;euen yeares &s;pace turneth &s;ticks and wood ca&s;t into it, into &s;tone. In <HI>Connagh</HI> there is a fountaine only kind and whole&s;ome for men: but for cattell and other &s;uch kind of bruite bea&s;ts pe&s;tilent and dangerous. There is a fountaine in <HI>Moun&s;ter,</HI> which if any man &s;hall touch, by and by the whole country wilbe ouerflowed by &s;torms of raine.</P>
<P>The people of this countrie do weare cour&s;e blacke mantles or rugges (for the &s;heep of this Iland are blacke) and they put them on as rudely and vnhand&s;omely. They v&s;e al&s;o little hoods which hang down to their &s;houlders. In riding they v&s;e no &s;addles, boots, nor &s;purres: but with a rod &s;harpe and tapered at one end, they pricke forward their hor&s;es, and make them runne. Their bridles are &s;uch as do &s;erue both for bitte and reigne, &s;o made as their hor&s;es only v&s;ed to gra&s;&s;e, are neuer hindred from eating. They go into the field to warre, naked and altogether vnarmed. They v&s;e three kind of weapons, long &s;peares, darts, and battell-axes. The people is wild and very vnciuill: they delight in nothing more then to liue idly, and libertie they preferre before great riches. I only ob&s;erued the people to delight much in mu&s;icall in&s;truments and in that to de&s;erue &s;ome commendation. The&s;e briefly we haue gleaned heere and there out of the hi&s;torie of <HI>Gyraldus Cambren&s;is,</HI> diligently retaining the tenor of his owne phra&s;e: which we haue thought good to tran&s;late word for word as they are deliuered by our Authour, that &s;uccedent ages might &s;ee, either the credulous &s;implicity of former times, or how time doth alter countries, people and maners of men. And becau&s;e we haue &s;poken before of <HI>S. Patricks</HI> purgatory, it &s;hall not be ami&s;&s;e to adde to tho&s;e former this di&s;cour&s;e of it, taken out of the twelfth booke of <HI>Cae&s;arius,</HI> his hi&s;torie of Things worth the remem|bring. When as S. <HI>Patricke,</HI> &s;aith he, conuerted this nation to Chri&s;tianity, and they made a doubt and beleeued not that men &s;hould be puni&s;hed for their &s;innes in the world to come, hee by earne&s;t praier obtained this place at the hand of God: the maner of the place is thus: There is a deepe pit or trench, enclo&s;ed round with a wall; there are al&s;o certaine Regular Canons: No man is &s;o great a &s;inner, to whom they enioine any greater penance, then to abide all one whole night in that purgatorie. If any man be de&s;irous to enter in, fir&s;t, making his confe&s;&s;ion, they admini&s;ter the &s;acrament vnto him, they anoint him, perfume him and in&s;truct him, thus: Thou &s;halt &s;ee this night &s;ay they, the a&s;&s;aults of the Deuill, and the horrible paines of hell, but they &s;hall not hurt thee, if thou haue but the name of Ie&s;us alwaies in thy mouth: But if thou &s;halt yeeld to the flattering enticements, or terrible threatnings of the Deuill, and &s;o &s;halt cea&s;e to call vpon the name of Ie&s;us, thou art &s;urely but a dead man. Then in the euening putting him into the pit, they &s;hut vp the dore, and comming againe in the morning, if they pre&s;entlie find him not, they looke no farther for him. Many haue died there, and many haue gone home againe, who&s;e vi&s;ions haue been written of the fore&s;aied friers, and are &s;hewed to &s;uch as are de&s;irous to &s;ee them.</P>

<HEAD>The I&s;les of the AZORES.</HEAD>
<P>_SOme are of opinion, that the&s;e I&s;les &s;ituate in the Atlantick or We&s;t Ocean, are &s;o named by the Spaniards, from a kinde of Hauks which they call <HI>Azor.</HI> And in the plurall number <HI>A&ccedil;ores.</HI> One writes, but fondlie, that they are &s;o called from the French word <HI>E&s;&s;orer,</HI> which &s;ignifieth to drie or wither. In Latin a man may call them <HI>Accipitrarias,</HI> or the I&s;les of Hauks, and in Greeke <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. Our Netherlanders terme them <HI>De vlaem&s;che eilanden,</HI> that is, The flemi&s;h I&s;lands, becau&s;e they are thought fir&s;t to haue beene di&s;couered by certaine Flemi&s;h Marchants of <HI>Bruges.</HI> At that time (they &s;aid) they could find nothing vpon them but trees (e&s;peciallie great &s;tore of Cedars) and woods, and foules, of diuers &s;orts; and thither they &s;ent inhabitants to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e and manure the &s;aid I&s;les. Afterward they &s;ubmitted them|&s;elues to the <HI>Portugales,</HI> vnder who&s;e gouernement they yet remaine. <HI>Lewes Marmolius</HI> fol. 38. reports that they were di&s;couered about the yeare 1455. Vndoubtedly auncient writers knew them not: yet might they name them perhaps. For whether they &s;pecified them vnder the name of <HI>Ca&s;siterides,</HI> I cannot be a&s;&s;ured. The Spani&s;h fleets laden with <HI>Indian</HI> commodities, doe v&s;ually in their returne touch at the&s;e I&s;les, before they ariue at <HI>Lisbone,</HI> or <HI>Cales.</HI> One &s;trange thing haue I heard concerning the &s;oile, or the heauenly influence, or (if I may &s;o &s;ay) the <HI>Genius</HI> of the&s;e I&s;les: For &s;ailing from the&s;e parts of the world towards <HI>America,</HI> &s;o &s;oone as you are pa&s;t the &s;aid I&s;les, you are freed from gnats, fleas, lice, and all kinde of noi&s;ome vermin, which beyond the <HI>A&ccedil;ores</HI> doe immediately die, and come to nothing.

The Inhabitants are greatly inriched by their <HI>Madder,</HI> wherewith clothes are died red. In this I&s;le growes plenty of this commodity, e&s;pecially about the places commonly called <HI>Los Altares,</HI> and <HI>Falladores.

<P>_THis I&s;le was &s;o named from a mountaine therein ri&s;ing &s;harpe in forme of a round Pyramis or Sugar-loafe. For what&s;ouer is naturally of that &s;hape is by the Portugals called <HI>Pico.</HI> This hill is three miles high: within it is hollow, and full of darcke caues. At the foote of this mountaine Ea&s;tward, there is a &s;pring of fre&s;h water, which &s;ometimes di&s;chargeth fierie &s;treames, and &s;tones burning hoat; and that with &s;o great force and violence, that it &s;ends them packing as it were with a current, by &s;teepe and lower places, euen to the &s;ea, whereas of the multitude of the&s;e &s;tones is made a promontory or headland commonly called <HI>Mi&s;terij.</HI> It is di&s;tant from the &s;aid fountaine 12. miles. At this pre&s;ent it &s;tretcheth a mile and halfe further into the &s;ea, in regard of the continual increa&s;e of this heape of &s;tones.

<P>Three memorable things (as writeth <HI>Nauagierus</HI>) are prouerbially &s;poken of <HI>Spaine:</HI> the fir&s;t, A bridge, ouer which the water runneth (whereas it runnes vnder all other bridges) namely the water-conduct at <HI>Segouia:</HI> the &s;econd, a city compa&s;&s;ed with fire, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Madrid,</HI> becau&s;e the town-walles are of flint: and the third, a bridge, whereon are daily fed ten thou&s;and head of cattel; whereby is &s;ignified the riuer <HI>Guadiana,</HI> which hiding it &s;elfe vnder ground for the &s;pace of &s;euen miles, doth then breake forth againe. Albeit this la&s;t is a thing &s;prung rather out of the peoples vulgar opinion, than out of truth; as <HI>Don George</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> Gouernour of <HI>Harlebeck,</HI> an eye-witne&s;&s;e mo&s;t worthy of credit, hath informed me, being a man conuer&s;ant in all kinde of hi&s;tory, and a a wonderfull &s;earcher and admirer of naturall Philo&s;ophie.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands belonging vnto <HI>Spaine,</HI> wherof ancient writers haue made mention, at the Celtick promontory, or Cape Fini&s;ter, are the <HI>Ca&s;siterides,</HI> which at this pre&s;ent are not to be found in the ocean. Al&s;o <HI>In&s;ulae Deorum,</HI> other|wi&s;e called <HI>Cicae,</HI> and of late times <HI>I&s;las de Bayona: Londobris</HI> named al&s;o <HI>Erythia,</HI> and now the <HI>Burlings: Gades</HI> in olde time dedicated to <HI>Hercules,</HI> now commonly called <HI>Cales.</HI> All the&s;e are in the Ocean. In the Mediterran &s;ea you haue <HI>Ophiu&s;a</HI> now called <HI>Formentera.</HI> As likewi&s;e the two <HI>Gymne&s;iae,</HI> or <HI>Baleares,</HI> at this pre&s;ent called by di&s;tinct names, the one <HI>Maiorca,</HI> and the other <HI>Minorca.</HI> The coa&s;t of <HI>Minorca</HI> is be&s;et round about with huge mountaines: but at the entrance of the hauen the roots of the&s;e mountaines are leuelled into a plaine, till they meet, at &s;o nar|row a di&s;tance, on the other &s;ide of the &s;hore, that no &s;hips can enter the harbor, but with a gentle gale of wind. The hauen is named <HI>Mahon,</HI> being a mo&s;t beautifull, and commodious place; for it &s;tretcheth almo&s;t foure miles in length, with many inlets, all which &s;erue for the harboring of &s;hips. From hence ari&s;eth a perpetuall ridge of mountaines, on which the inhabitants cut downe great plenty of wood. At the vtmo&s;t part therof on the moun|tain-tops is built a city. Contrariwi&s;e the greater I&s;land hath a plaine &s;hore, and mo&s;t high and barren moun|taines in the midde&s;t.

<HEAD>The Kingdome of PORTVGALE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_PORTVGALE</HI> is vnproperly called <HI>Lu&s;itania;</HI> for neither is all <HI>Portugale</HI> com|prehended in <HI>Lu&s;itania,</HI> nor all <HI>Lu&s;itania</HI> in <HI>Portugale:</HI> yet can it not be denied, that the better part of <HI>Lu&s;itania</HI> is &s;ubiect to the King of <HI>Portugale. Portugale</HI> is diuided into three regions, <HI>Tran&s;tagana,</HI> or that which lies beyond or South of <HI>Tagus,</HI> the riuer of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> as far as <HI>Guadiana; Ci&s;tagana</HI> &s;ituate on this &s;ide or North of <HI>Tagus,</HI> as far as the riuer <HI>Douro;</HI> and <HI>Interamnis. Tran&s;tagana</HI> border vpon that part of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> which from the riuer <HI>Guadiana</HI> extendeth to the limits of <HI>Ca|&s;tilia Nuoua. Interamnis</HI> I call that which lies between the riuers <HI>Douro</HI> and <HI>Minho,</HI> a region no le&s;&s;e plea&s;ant than fruitfull. This <HI>Interamnis</HI> or Riuer bounded prouince, is wholly out of the limits of <HI>Lu&s;itania;</HI> vnle&s;&s;e reiecting the former de&s;cription, we will rather incline to <HI>Strabo,</HI> who &s;aith that the greate&s;t part of <HI>Lu&s;itania</HI> is inhabited by the <HI>Callaici.</HI> The length of this region is twelue leagues, and the bredth, where it is large&s;t, is twelue leagues al&s;o; being in other places but &s;ix or foure leagues ouer. And in this &s;o &s;mall a portion of ground, be&s;ides the Metropolitan church of <HI>Braga,</HI> the Cathedrall of <HI>Porto,</HI> and other fiue Collegiate churches, there are aboue <HI>130.</HI> mona&s;teries, the greater part whereof are endowed with mo&s;t ample reuenues: and al&s;o to the number of <HI>1460.</HI> Pari&s;h churches, as one writeth. Certaine it is, that within the peculiar Dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Braga</HI> there are accounted <HI>800.</HI> Whereby you may ea&s;ily coniecture both the fruitfulne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, and the ancient deuotion of the inhabitants. But of the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e what need we &s;peake, whenas within this one prouince are found aboue fiue and twenty thou&s;and &s;pringing fountaines; bridges mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly built of &s;quare &s;tone almo&s;t two hundred; and hauens for &s;hipping to the number of &s;ix? The&s;e things therefore I thought not vnfit to be remembred, becau&s;e the goodne&s;&s;e and woorth of this Prouince is in a maner vnknowen. To the East hereof adioy|neth the prouince called <HI>Tran&s;montana,</HI> that is to &s;ay, on the other &s;ide of the mountaines; it aboun|deth with excellent Wheat, and &s;trong Wine, and containes within it the city <HI>Bragan&ccedil;a,</HI> which is the head of a mo&s;t large Dukedome. Thus much out of <HI>Va&s;eus. Peter de Medina</HI> reckoneth and nameth in this Kingdome of <HI>Portugale</HI> &s;ixty &s;euen cities or walled townes.</P>
<P>To the Kingdome of <HI>Portugale</HI> at this pre&s;ent belongeth the Kingdome of <HI>Algarue,</HI> which is no|thing els, but the South part of the whole Kingdome towards the &s;ea. For the King entitles him&s;elfe <HI>King of Portugale, of Algarue, of Guinie, of Aethiopia, Per&s;ia and India.</HI> This Kingdom fir&s;t began about the yeere <HI>1100.</HI> For vntill then, as al&s;o in ancient times, it went altogether vnder the name of <HI>Spaine. Marinaeus</HI> thus writeth of it: One <HI>Henry</HI> Earle of <HI>Loraigne,</HI> a man of most vndoubted valour, comming out of <HI>France</HI> atchieued great exploits again&s;t the <HI>Moores.</HI> In regard wherof <HI>Alon&s;o</HI> the &s;ixt, King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> gaue him in marriage his ba&s;e daughter called <HI>Tire&s;ia;</HI> and a&s;signed for her dowry part of <HI>Gallicia</HI> contained in the kingdome of <HI>Portugale.</HI> Of this marriage afterwards was born <HI>Alphon&s;us,</HI> the fir&s;t King of <HI>Portugale,</HI> he that recouered <HI>Lisbon</HI> from the <HI>Moores.</HI> Who hauing vanqui&s;hed fiue of their Kings in one battell, left vnto po&s;terity, as a monument of this exploit, his armes con&s;i&s;ting of fiue &s;cutchions. <HI>Oliuer &agrave; Marca</HI> in his Chronicle publi&s;hed in French, more particularly blazeth the armes of this kingdome. At fir&s;t he &s;aith, it was a plaine &s;iluer &s;cutchion without any portra|ture; afterwards in regard of the fiue vanqui&s;hed kings there were fiue &s;cutchions impo&s;ed; and in euery of the fiue &s;cutchions fiue &s;iluer circles, in remembrance of the fiue wounds of our Sauior <HI>CHRIST,</HI> which in time of the battell miraculou&s;ly appeared vnto <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> in the skies; or (as others report) for that being wounded with fiue mortall wounds, by the prouidence of Almighty God he e&s;caped death.</P>
<P>Reade al&s;o <HI>Ierome O&s;orius, Marinaeus Siculus,</HI> and <HI>Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter.</HI> Of the originall of this Kingdome reade the fir&s;t chapter of <HI>Iohn Barros</HI> his Decades of <HI>A&s;ia. Athenaeus</HI> in his eighth booke and fir&s;t chapter writeth &s;omewhat of the fruitfulne&s;&s;e of this Region, and the excellent tempera|ture of the aire. <HI>Lisbon</HI> the chiefe city of the Kingdome, <HI>Damianus a Goes</HI> de&s;cribeth in a peculiar Treati&s;e. Concerning the antiquities of <HI>Portugale</HI> there is a booke written by <HI>Andrew Re&s;ende.</HI></P>
<P>The Portugales Dominions at this pre&s;ent are very large; for they extend euen from the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> along all the Sea Prouinces, and the I&s;lands adiacent, as farre as <HI>China,</HI> and the I&s;les called <HI>Lequios.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Dioce&s;&s;e of SIVILL, being part of ANDALVZIA.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Dioce&s;&s;e of the Church of <HI>Siuill</HI> is &s;ituate in that prouince of <HI>Spaine,</HI> which in rich com|modities, and a kinde of fruitfull and peculiar brauery excelleth all the re&s;t. This beautifull prouince the ancients, of the riuer <HI>Baetis,</HI> called <HI>Baetica:</HI> but late Writers haue named it <HI>VVandalicia,</HI> or <HI>Andaluzia</HI> of the Vandals, who about a thou&s;and yeres pa&s;t ouerran the &s;ame. The &s;aid Dioce&s;&s;e or territory, of all the regions and territories in <HI>Spaine,</HI> is rightly e&s;tee|med the mo&s;t happy, both in regard of the multitude and ciuility of the inhabitants, and of their riches, and ouerflowing abundance of all things; this being confirmed euen by the ver&s;es of the Grecians, who attribute the Elizian plea&s;ures and delights vnto this tract, which bordereth vpon the We&s;t Ocean. This territory containeth here &amp; there almo&s;t 200. principall townes, be&s;ides a great number of villages; &s;o that there are now more townes vnder the iuri&s;diction of this one dioce&s;&s;e or conuent, than there were of old in all foure together: for (as <HI>Plinie</HI> writeth) they pre&s;cribed lawes but only to 175. townes. And how &s;mall a number will the&s;e &s;eeme to be, if tho&s;e hundred thou&s;and villages be accounted, which only in the territory of <HI>Siuill,</HI> called by the Arabians <HI>Axarafi,</HI> were by King <HI>Ferdinand</HI> receiued into loyall allegeance together with the city it &s;elfe? which notwith&s;tanding after the departure of the Moores, became the greate&s;t part of them de&s;olate: howbeit the limits of this as they differ much from the ancient precincts of Spa|ni&s;h dioce&s;&s;es; &s;o do they come neerer to the forme pre&s;cribed by King <HI>Vamba</HI> vnto all the Cathedrals of <HI>Spaine.</HI> For this dioce&s;&s;e hath on the Ea&s;t the territory of <HI>Corduba;</HI> We&s;t the frontiers of <HI>Algarue;</HI> North it lieth ouer a|gain&s;t that part of <HI>Portugale</HI> which is called The gouernment of <HI>Saint Iago:</HI> but the re&s;idue toward the South is in|clo&s;ed with the dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Cadiz</HI> and the Ocean &s;ea. Principall townes here are very many, e&s;pecially the royall city of <HI>Siuill,</HI> mo&s;t largely and plea&s;antly &s;ituate vpon the banke of <HI>Baetis,</HI> and enuironed with beautifull and &s;tately walles. This famous riuer <HI>Baetis</HI> or <HI>Guadalquibir</HI> &s;pringing out of the fore&s;t called in times pa&s;t <HI>Saltus Tugi|en&s;is,</HI> and holding on his cour&s;e by the chiefe cities of his adopted prouince, doth from this noble city, knowen of olde by the name of <HI>Colonia Romulea,</HI> continue his &s;treames in a chanell nauigable and abounding with fi&s;h, to the We&s;terne Ocean, for the &s;pace of three&s;core miles, the banks on both &s;ides flouri&s;hing with Oliuets, Vine|yards, and mo&s;t admirable &s;weet Gardens, perfumed with the delectable and fragrant odour of Citrons.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Siuill</HI> both for churches and hou&s;es is the gallante&s;t city in all <HI>Spaine,</HI> and for the neat attire of the Citi|zens, and a kinde of &s;eemeline&s;&s;e to them only peculiar, is inferiour to no city in all the world. Here religion, the &s;tudy of liberall arts and the practi&s;e of gentlemanlike exerci&s;es are in their prime. And &s;o infinite are the riches and trea&s;ures included within the walles of this city, as neuer the like in olde time could be found in any King|dome or Empire how great &s;oeuer, the Roman only excepted. For this being the riche&s;t of all the cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> largely di&s;tributes ouer all Chri&s;tendome that vn&s;peakable wealth, and before the&s;e la&s;t times neuer dream't of, which it fetcheth as it were from another world, that from hence was fir&s;t di&s;couered. Wherewith al&s;o it abun|dantly furni&s;heth the very barbarous and &s;auage nations, inhabiting the inmo&s;t part of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> It is mo&s;t apparent, that for certaine yeeres together in the account-books of the <HI>Indies-contractation-hou&s;e,</HI> there was mo&s;t faithfully regi&s;tred an hundred &amp; more millions of gold. So that hence a man may coniecture, that &s;o much more was concealed by tho&s;e that brought it, for feare le&s;t the King for &s;ome certaine time &s;hould haue borrowed it. What may we then thinke of the infinit &amp; incredible ma&s;&s;e of riches which from their fir&s;t di&s;couery of <HI>America</HI> till this pre&s;ent, hath hither been tran&s;ported; two fleets yeerely returning into <HI>Spaine,</HI> laden in a maner with no other kind of merchandi&s;e, but gold and &s;iluer, and for the mo&s;t part bala&s;ted with both? But the&s;e (you wil &s;ay) are forren and far-fetcht commodities. It is &s;o rich therefore of it &s;elfe, that it payes for yeerely tribute vnto the King, to whom it is mo&s;t loyally deuoted, a million and an halfe of golde: &s;o much as many Princes can &s;car&s;e rai&s;e out of their whole kingdomes. Here re&s;ide for traffike innumerable multitudes of &s;trangers, be&s;ides whom of late yeres there haue been found 24000 Citizens hou&s;holders, diuided into 28. wards. The fir&s;t of the&s;e wards is famous both in regard of the name, and the church of <HI>S. Mary,</HI> than which all Chri&s;tendome hath not a more excellent, if you con&s;ider the large and magnificent building with the beauteous and admirable ornaments, and the &s;teeple likewi&s;e of exceeding higth, from whence &s;ignes are giuen at certaine houres, wherein &s;tands a lofty pinacle of mo&s;t curious workman&s;hip, out of which you may behold a mo&s;t glorious pro&s;pect ouer all the city, and the fields adiacent. What &s;hould I here de&s;cribe the royall magnificence of the kings ca&s;tle; than which the Kings of <HI>Spaine</HI> haue none more gorgeou&s;ly built, or plea&s;antly &s;ituate? Or to what purpo&s;e &s;hould I recount the &s;umptuous palaces of Dukes, Earles and Nobles; or the neat hou&s;es of Citizens, with their cry&s;tall fountains, greene arbours, and odoriferous gardens? with &s;ilence I omit the ancient water-&s;treames di&s;fu&s;ed by arches tho|row all parts of the city; and tho&s;e later ones, which by the infinit co&s;t, and indu&s;try of the Senatours &amp; Citizens of <HI>Siuill,</HI> haue for publicke delight beene conueyed to the place commonly called <HI>Hercules pillars;</HI> where by plan|ting of trees they haue conuerted a large fenny quagmire into a mo&s;t beautifull groue, leauing faire and broad &s;paces for men to walke, run, and di&s;port them&s;elues in. Now the gardens without the city, fraught with all vari|ety of plea&s;ures, and tho&s;e &s;tately hou&s;es in the fields, bordering vpon <HI>Baetis,</HI> who can &s;ufficiently commend? Out of which they may dayly behold &s;hips comming in both from the old and new world. For <HI>Siuill</HI> the queene of the Ocean, being placed as a mediatre&s;&s;e between both, conioines them together by pro&s;perous nauigations, and rich trafficks. Tedious it were to &s;et forth the maie&s;tie of the Kings palace, or of his ca&s;tle at <HI>Triana.</HI> This <HI>Triana</HI> is a faire &s;uburbe on the farther &s;ide of <HI>Baetis,</HI> inhabited almo&s;t with three thou&s;and Citizens, and ioyned to the city

For oile, corne, and wine <HI>Con&s;tantina, Ca&ccedil;alla,</HI> and <HI>Maronio</HI> do principally excell: <HI>Nebri&s;a</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ituate at the mouth of <HI>Baetis,</HI> the mo&s;t happie natiue &s;oile of <HI>Aelius Antonius,</HI> the re&s;torer and author of the Latin tongue in <HI>Spaine,</HI> is famous for antiquity, and inferiour to none in plenty of Corne.

Other principall townes of this Dioce&s;&s;e for breuities &s;ake I omit.</P>
<P>The &s;oile in all this tract is mo&s;t miraculou&s;ly plentifull of wheat, wine, and oile, and of all kinde of graine, where|with it &s;upplieth remote and forrein countreies: and how de&s;eruedly might <HI>Plinie</HI> haue preferred this part before <HI>Italie,</HI> had not he, an Italian, caried a greater affection to his owne countrey? yet <HI>Spaine</HI> by him: where&s;oeuer it borders vpon the &s;ea, is commended: which prai&s;e of his we vnder&s;tand e&s;pecially of that part of <HI>Andaluzia,</HI> which pertaines to the Dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Siuill,</HI> becau&s;e it lies open to the maine Ocean, and to the gentle bla&s;ts of the we&s;t.

It is commonly called Old <HI>Siuill,</HI> the va&s;t ruines thereof being now &s;car&s;e extant, a wofull &s;pectacle of the mutability of humane things, by &s;o much the more to be lamented, in that the forlorne fragments of that mo&s;t beautifull and large <HI>Amphitheatrum,</HI> which now lie &s;cattered and di&s;iointed, renew a more &s;ad memory of the ancient greatne&s;&s;e and magnificence.</P>

Sufficeth that we do gather out of their own audits &amp; accounts, that the archbi&s;hops yerely reuenues amount to aboue 100000. duckets. The princi|pall of the church vnder him haue cleerely more than 30000: the whole &s;ociety of the church is allowed 120000. which are diuided among 40. Canons, 11. priuileged prie&s;ts, 20. fellow-portionaries or pen&s;ioners, and &s;o many halfe-pen&s;ioners; yet &s;o, as the Canons and priuileged prie&s;ts haue &s;uch daily allowance, as by the yeere comes to 2000. duckats a man, the pen&s;ioners haue le&s;&s;e than &s;o much by a fourth part, and the halfe-pen&s;ioners are allowed only a third part. Next vnto the Archbi&s;hop the greate&s;t authority remaines in the Deane, who&s;e dignity is e&s;tee|med worth 5000. duckats a yeere. Be&s;ides, here are in this church 20. ma&s;&s;e-prie&s;ts, which from their number we call <HI>Vicenarios;</HI> who for their nightly and daily orizons, are allowed euery day among&s;t them all 200. duckats and a|boue: al&s;o there are 200. other prie&s;ts, who out of their priuate chapels do rai&s;e &s;tipends &s;ufficient for their mainte|nance. Rich benefices in this dioce&s;&s;e there are to the number of 600, many whereof are valued at 1000. &s;ome at 2000. duckats by the yeere: and of le&s;&s;er cures, which are called chapels or chanteries, almo&s;t 2000. Here are like|wi&s;e many cloi&s;ters of monks and nunnes, wherein their religion and the &s;tudy of their diuinity flouri&s;heth, mo&s;t of them in yeerely reuenues being able to di&s;pend 6000. duckats. There &s;tands a mona&s;tery of Carthu&s;ians mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly built vpon the banke of <HI>Baetis</HI> within view of <HI>Siuill,</HI> which hath 25000. duckats by the yeere. Long it were to recken vp all their ho&s;pitals, whenas within <HI>Siuill</HI> only there are aboue 120. very richly indowed, many with 8000. and &s;ome with 15000. duckats of yerely income.

(Plinie</HI> al&s;o mentions the people <HI>Sede|tanos,</HI> and the region <HI>Sedetania,</HI> but diuers from the&s;e; as appeareth out of his third booke and third chapter.) In this tract &s;tands the city of <HI>Valentia,</HI> albeit <HI>Ptole|mey</HI> a&s;cribes it to the <HI>Cote&s;tani,</HI> a nation bordering not farre off. From this city, as from the principall, all the whole region is denominated, and it containes the ancient <HI>Hedetania, Cote&s;tania,</HI> and part of <HI>Ilercaonia.</HI> This prouince put on the title of a kingdome, about the yeere of our Lord <HI>788.</HI> as you may reade in <HI>Peter de Medina,</HI> and <HI>Peter Antonie Beuthero.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;ituate vpon the Mediterran &s;ea, and is refre&s;hed with the &s;treames of <HI>Turia,</HI> a riuer &s;o called by <HI>Salu&s;t, Pri&s;cian,</HI> and <HI>Vibius:</HI> by <HI>Pomponius Mela, Durias,</HI> and by <HI>Plinie, Turium.</HI> Now they call it <HI>Guetalabiar,</HI> which is an Arabicke name impo&s;ed by the Moores, and in Engli&s;h is as much to &s;ay, as pure and cleare water. It is a riuer not very deepe; but in regard of the euerflouri&s;hing banks, be|decked with ro&s;es and &s;undry kinds of flowers, mo&s;t exceeding plea&s;ant. It is on both &s;ides from the very fountaine to the outlet, naturally clad with beautifull and &s;hadie woods: euery where you may behold the Withy, the Plane, the Pine-tree, and other trees, neuer di&s;robed of their leaues: &s;o that <HI>Claudian</HI> wrote mo&s;t truly of it; <HI>Faire</HI> Duria, <HI>with flowers and ro&s;ie banks adorn'd.</HI> There is al&s;o the riuer <HI>Sucro,</HI> which by a new name they call <HI>Xucar.</HI> Two hilles here are among the rest, one called <HI>Mariola,</HI> and the other <HI>Pennagolo&s;a,</HI> that is, The rocke of dainties; wherunto from other places re&s;ort great &s;tore of Herbali&s;ts &amp; Phy&s;icians: for vpon the&s;e hilles grow great abundance of very rare plants and herbs. They haue al&s;o a &s;iluer-mine at a place called <HI>Buriol,</HI> in the way from <HI>Valentia</HI> to <HI>Torto&s;a.</HI> In a place likewi&s;e named <HI>Aioder</HI> are found certaine &s;tones interlaced with golden veines. At Cape <HI>Fini|&s;trat</HI> there are yron-mines, and &s;o are there by <HI>Iabea.</HI> About <HI>Segorbia,</HI> there is yet mention of a quar|rey, from whence Marble was wont to be conueyed to <HI>Rome.</HI> In <HI>Picacent</HI> they dig Alaba&s;ter, and all the countrey ouer Allume, Oker, Lime, and Plai&s;ter in great abundance. But the greatest riches of this countrey con&s;i&s;teth in earthen ve&s;&s;els, which they call Porcellan: which may perhaps be the &s;ame that ancient Writers call <HI>Va&s;a Murrhina.</HI> The&s;e are made in diuers places of this kingdome &s;o curiou&s;ly, and with &s;uch arte, as the be&s;t Porcellans in <HI>Italie,</HI> (whereof in all countreys &s;uch reckening is made) can hardly be preferred before them. Who de&s;ires to know more of the excellency of this region, and how fertile it is of all things, e&s;pecially of Sugar, Wine and Oile; let him reade the <HI>9. 12.</HI> and <HI>13.</HI> books written by <HI>Bernardine Gomez,</HI> concerning the life of <HI>Iames</HI> the fir&s;t, King of <HI>Aragon.</HI></P>
<P>Among the cities of this kingdome, <HI>Valentia</HI> is the principall, and the &s;ea of a bi&s;hop; which bi&s;hop (as <HI>Marinaeus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Damianus a Goes</HI> do report) may di&s;pend <HI>13000.</HI> duckats by the yeere. Amongst all the Valentias of <HI>Europe,</HI> this (&s;aith <HI>Bernardin Gomez</HI>) is called by the French, <HI>Valen|tia</HI> the great: for it containeth <HI>12000.</HI> hou&s;es, be&s;ides the &s;uburbs &amp; gardens, which haue as many hou|&s;es almo&s;t as the city it &s;elfe. <HI>Peter de Medina</HI> writeth, that in this city there are aboue <HI>10000.</HI> welles of fountaine water. An exact de&s;cription thereof you may reade in <HI>Iohn Mariana</HI> his <HI>12.</HI> booke and <HI>19.</HI> chap. It is &s;o beautifull, as the Spaniards in a common prouerbe &s;ay, Rich <HI>Bar&ccedil;elona,</HI> Plentifull <HI>Sara|go&ccedil;a,</HI> and Faire <HI>Valentia. Plinie</HI> cals it a colonie of the Romans. He &s;aith, it is three miles di&s;tant from the &s;ea. That this city of ancient time was called <HI>Roma</HI> of <HI>Romus</HI> the king of <HI>Spaine, Annius</HI> out of <HI>Manethon,</HI> and <HI>Beutherus</HI> out of the Annales do report: let them&s;elues auow it. In an ancient in&s;cription it is named <HI>COLONIA IVLIA VALENTIA.</HI> It retained the name of <HI>Rome</HI> (&s;aith the &s;ame <HI>Beutherus</HI>) vntill the Romans &s;ubdued it. Who hauing inlarged &amp; beautified the &s;ame, called it <HI>Va|lentia,</HI> a name &s;ignifying the quality of the place. Here was a councell held in the yere of our Lord <HI>466.</HI> It is a city of venerable antiquity, where euen till the&s;e our dayes remaine many ancient marbles with in|&s;criptions of the Romans grauen vpon them, whereof &s;ome are in the cu&s;tody of the &s;aid <HI>Beutherus</HI> and <HI>Ambr.

<P>The territory of this city is for the greate&s;t part inhabited by a people de&s;cended of the Moores, re|taining as yet the &s;peech and conuer&s;ation of their fathers and grandfathers, which I learned of that mo&s;t worthie and famous man <HI>Frederick Furius Caeriolanus</HI> naturall of <HI>Valentia.</HI></P>

<P>_VNder the name of <HI>Gades, Strabo, Plinie,</HI> and &s;ome other Writers giue notice of two i&s;lands. <HI>Mela, Solimus, Dio|ny&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey</HI> make mention but of one, which together with the city, they call <HI>Gadira.</HI> They that will haue two <HI>Gades,</HI> call the one, <HI>The greater,</HI> and the other, <HI>The le&s;&s;er.</HI> This (as writeth <HI>Plinie</HI> out of <HI>Phili&s;tides, Ti|maeus,</HI> and <HI>Silenus;</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> out of <HI>Pherecides</HI>) was named <HI>Erythia,</HI> and <HI>Aphrodi&s;ea,</HI> and they call it al&s;o <HI>Iunoes</HI> I&s;land. By the inhabitants al&s;o it was properly called <HI>Erythia,</HI> and <HI>Cotinu&s;a,</HI> by the Carthaginians <HI>Gadir,</HI> and the Romans named it <HI>Tarte&s;&s;on,</HI> as the &s;ame <HI>Plinie</HI> writeth. At this pre&s;ent there is but one only i&s;le (and that verie much dimini&s;hed by the oceans violent waues) which the Spaniards call <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Caliz,</HI> and our countrymen (I know not vpon what ground) <HI>Calis-Malis.</HI> In the le&s;&s;er of the two fore&s;aid i&s;les &s;tood the towne of <HI>Gades;</HI> and in the greater, <HI>Iulia Gaditana Augu&s;ta;</HI> which before, as appeareth out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> was called <HI>Neapolis.</HI> Now they call both towne and i&s;land <HI>Cadiz.</HI> It is the &s;eat of a Bi&s;hop, who al&s;o is intitled Bi&s;hop of <HI>Alger.</HI></P>
<P>This I&s;le was fir&s;t di&s;couered and inhabited by certaine Phoenicians of <HI>Tyrus,</HI> as is euident out of mo&s;t ancient records. Vpon this i&s;le &s;ome are of opinion, that the Geryones afterward planted them&s;elues, who&s;e droues the Aegyptian or Tyrian <HI>Hercules</HI> forcibly draue away. At one corner of the i&s;le &s;tood the temple of this <HI>Hercules,</HI> famous both for builders, &s;uper&s;tition, riches and antiquity. Why it &s;hould be holy (&s;aith <HI>Mela</HI>) his bones there buried are a &s;ufficient cau&s;e. Vpon the other corner <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmes the temple of <HI>Saturne</HI> to haue been ere|cted. In the &s;aid temple of <HI>Hercules, Cae&s;ar</HI> found the image of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, as <HI>Suetonius</HI> in his life reporteth. A fountaine there was very hol&s;ome to drinke, which with a &s;trange kind of contrariety dimini&s;hed at the floud, and increa&s;ed at the ebbe of the &s;ea. In this temple (as the &s;ame author affirmeth) were certaine brazen pillars of eight cubits, wheron were ingrauen the co&s;ts be&s;towed in building of the &s;ame. Here al&s;o the &s;ame author out of <HI>Artemidorus</HI> acknowledgeth a temple dedicated to <HI>Iuno. Diony&s;ius</HI> de&s;cribes therein the temple of Age and of Death, and tels of certaine altars con&s;ecrated to the Yere, to the Moneth, to Arte, and to Pouerty. <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars are here extant (&s;aith <HI>I&s;i|dore</HI>) and here growes a kind of tree like a palme, with the gum whereof the gla&s;&s;e of <HI>Epyrus</HI> being mingled, is turned into a precious &s;tone.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of old were famous for their skill in nauigation, and from this their ancient trauer&s;ing of the &s;eas, they do not as yet dege|nerate. But their principall gaine con&s;i&s;teth in making of Salt, and in catching of Tunies: for which they haue euery yeere an ordinary fi&s;h|ing. The&s;e fi&s;hes being cut in pieces, pouldred and barrelled, are di&s;per&s;ed all <HI>Europe</HI> ouer.</P>
<P>This i&s;le was e&s;teemed by antiquitie the worlds extreame We&s;terne limit; whereupon &s;aith <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> in his fir&s;t booke, <HI>And</HI> Gades <HI>the vtmost bounds of men, &amp;c.</HI> Al&s;o in his 17. booke: Gades <HI>lands farthe&s;t end; And</HI> Calpe, <HI>bounding</HI> Hercules;

Belgica</HI> which is enuironed by the Ocean &s;ea, and the riuers of <HI>Rhene, Marne,</HI> and <HI>Senie,</HI> v&s;ing mo&s;t part the Dutch tongue, and at this pre&s;ent called the <HI>Low-countries. Celtica</HI> or <HI>Lugdunen&s;is,</HI> which is comprehended within the riuers <HI>Garomne, Marne, Senie,</HI> and <HI>Rho&s;ne.</HI> It is now called <HI>France.</HI> For the <HI>Celtae</HI> were &s;ubdued by the Francks of <HI>Germany:</HI> &s;o that at length they were named We&s;terne Francks, from whom the prouince it &s;elfe is denominated. <HI>Aquitanica</HI> before named <HI>Aremorica,</HI> which extendeth from the riuer <HI>Garomne</HI> to the Ocean, and to the Pyreney mountaines. We&s;t and by North it is confined with that part of the Ocean which is called the Bay of <HI>Aquitane.</HI> We&s;tward. it hath <HI>Spaine:</HI> North, <HI>Celtica</HI> or <HI>France</HI> properly &s;o called: and South, the country of <HI>Prouence.</HI> It is now called <HI>Ga&s;coine,</HI> and the inhabitants differ both in &s;tature, and language from the re&s;idue of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the ancient limits of the Gaules. Howbeit the countrey of the French, which at this day beares the title of a Kingdome, and is commonly called the Kingdome of <HI>France;</HI> hath not &s;o large ex|ten&s;ion: but towards the North only is &s;o much the narower, as it is cut off by an imaginary line from <HI>Strasbourg</HI> vpon <HI>Rhene</HI> to the port of <HI>Calais;</HI> and it comprehends all that tract of land, which is con|teined within this line, the Ocean &s;ea, the Pyreney mountaines, the &s;ea Mediterran, and the <HI>Alpes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Po&s;tellus</HI> in his booke of the whole world, reckons vp the peculiar Shires, or Prouinces of this King|dome in maner following: In the Ea&s;t it hath <HI>Prouence, Sauoie, Swi&s;&s;erland, Bre&s;sia, Borgogne, Lorraigne, Champanie, Henault, Cleue,</HI> and <HI>Flanders:</HI> on the North, <HI>Picardy, Normandy,</HI> and <HI>Bretaigne:</HI> on the We&s;t, <HI>Bre|taigne, Aniou, Poictou, Xantoigne,</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;coigne:</HI> and on the South, <HI>Ga&s;coigne, Bearne, Rou&s;sillon, Dauphnie, Vellay, Fore&s;t, Auuergne, Limo&s;ni, Perigort,</HI> and <HI>Angole&s;me.</HI> Ea&s;t of <HI>Poictou</HI> lie the prouinces of <HI>Bourges, Bour|bon, Beaioulois, Lionnois,</HI> the Countie of <HI>Burgundy, Auxerrois, Niuernois, Berry, Tours, Vendo&s;me</HI> beyond <HI>An|iou, le Beaul&s;e, Ga&s;tinois, Valois</HI> beyond <HI>Sens,</HI> and not farre off <HI>le Perche, Drui&s;e,</HI> and <HI>le Mans</HI> neere <HI>Bretaigne.</HI> And thus at this pre&s;ent are the&s;e Prouinces named. But albeit <HI>Po&s;tellus</HI> accounteth <HI>Sauoy, Swizzerland, Loraigne, Henault, Cleue,</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI> among the Prouinces of <HI>France,</HI> yet are they not now vnder the go|uernment of this Kingdome: for all of them haue peculiar princes, not &s;ubiect to the crowne of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the French King, <HI>Villa Nueua</HI> reports two memorable things: Fir&s;t, That in the Church of <HI>Rhemes</HI> there is a ve&s;&s;ell full of neuer-decaying oile, &s;ent from heauen, to anoint the Kings of <HI>France</HI> at their coronation. Secondly, That the &s;ame Kings doe heale the di&s;ea&s;e called in Engli&s;h, <HI>The Queenes euill,</HI> only with touching the place affected.</P>
<P>All <HI>France</HI> is de&s;cribed in a large volume, by <HI>Robert Caenalis;</HI> reade al&s;o concerning the &s;ame argument <HI>Gilbert Cognatus Nazorenus; Iohannes Marius; Cha&s;&s;anaeus</HI> in his twelfth booke <HI>De gloria mundi; Po&s;tellus</HI> in his booke Of the whole world; <HI>Aimon</HI> in the beginning of his &s;torie of the Franks; <HI>Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter; Belle|fore&s;t; Theuet;</HI> and other De&s;cribers of the world. Touching this region al&s;o, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants, you may learne &s;omewhat out of the &s;econd booke of <HI>Laonicus Chalcocondylas</HI> of <HI>Athens.</HI> Of ancient Writers <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his fifth booke, and <HI>Ann. Marcelinus</HI> in his fif|teenth booke haue many notable things concerning this region.

<HEAD>BRETAIGNE and NORMANDY.</HEAD>
<P>_THis Table repre&s;enteth that part of <HI>Gallia Lugdunen&s;is</HI> which &s;tretcheth toward the We&s;terne Ocean. The ancients named it <HI>Armorica.</HI> Heere &s;tandeth <HI>Neu&s;tria,</HI> corruptly &s;o called of late yeeres for <HI>Ve&s;tria</HI> or rather <HI>We&s;tria,</HI> (according to &s;ome, <HI>We&s;tra&s;ia</HI>) as much to &s;ay, as a We&s;terne region. The occa&s;ion of this errour both in pronunciation and writing, was for that the French wanting a double V, doe alwayes in &s;tead thereof write a &s;ingle V: and becau&s;e u in this &s;mall forme differs not much from n, hereupon it is likely that <HI>We&s;tria</HI> was prodigiou&s;ly changed into <HI>Neu&s;tria.</HI> In which <HI>Neu&s;tria</HI> at this pre&s;ent are &s;ituate the regions of <HI>Bretaigne</HI> and <HI>Normandie,</HI> which in this Table we pre&s;ent vnto your view. NORMANDIA &s;o called of the Northerne peo|ple that ouer-ranne it (for <HI>Nord</HI> in Dutch &s;ignifieth North, and <HI>mannen</HI> men) which Northerne people were Danes and Noruegians: who hauing by force &s;ubdued this region, planted them|&s;elues here in the time of <HI>Lotharius</HI> the Emperour. Concerning the &s;ituation and nature of this place, the&s;e are the words of <HI>Gaguinus</HI> in his &s;euenth booke: <HI>Normandie</HI> is adorned and fortified with one Metropolitan, &s;ix cities, and ninetie foure &s;trong townes and ca&s;tles: mo&s;t of their villages al&s;o being built citie-like: thorow which Prouince a &s;peedie traueller &s;hall hardlie pa&s;&s;e in &s;ix dayes: it aboundeth with fi&s;h, cattell, and plentie of corne; being in all places &s;o fraught with peares and apples, that the people make all their drinke of the &s;ame; and yet &s;end great quantitie to other countreys. They exerci&s;e clothing, and are notable quaffers of cyder. They are naturally a wilie people; &s;ubiect to no forren lawes; liuing after their owne fa|&s;hions and cu&s;tomes, which they mo&s;t ob&s;tinately maintaine: cunning they are in &s;leights and &s;utes of law; whereupon &s;trangers are loth to haue any dealings with them; being otherwi&s;e well addicted to learning and religion. Moreouer, they are very apt and valiant in the warres, many of who&s;e worthy acts again&s;t &s;trangers are recorded. Thus farre <HI>Gaguinus.</HI> Of the qualitie of this region you may more largely informe your &s;elfe out of <HI>Henry Alti&s;siodoren&s;is</HI> his fifth booke of the life of <HI>S. German.</HI> It aboundeth, as <HI>Caenalis</HI> makes report, with all things nece&s;&s;ary for mans life, wine only excepted, which the &s;oile doth not yeeld. The chiefe city is <HI>Rouen</HI> (in Engli&s;h commonly called <HI>Roan</HI>) which hath a mo&s;t learned Senate, or Court of Parliament, that execute iu&s;tice, and decide the controuer&s;ies of the whole Prouince. Heere are al&s;o great Mer|chants, by meanes of who&s;e trafficke the citie is knowen farre and neere. In this citie there is a church dedicated to the Vir|gin <HI>Mary,</HI> beautified with a mo&s;t lofty &s;teeple, wherin hangs the greate&s;t bell in all <HI>France,</HI> weighing forty thou&s;and pounds, as the&s;e French ver&s;es grauen thereupon do te&s;tifie.</P>
<Q><L>Ie &s;uis nomin&eacute;e <HI>George</HI> d' Amboi&s;e,</L>
<L>Qui plus que trente &s;ix mil poi&s;e:</L>
<L>Et &s;i qui bien me poy&s;era</L>
<L>Quarante mil y trouuera.</L></Q>
<P>In Engli&s;h:</P>
<Q><L><HI>George</HI> de Amboi&s;e my name rightly &s;ounds,</L>
<L>I weigh more than thirtie &s;ix thou&s;and pounds:</L>
<L>Who&s;o poi&s;eth me well</L>
<L>Fortie thou&s;and may tell.</L></Q>
<P>This <HI>George,</HI> after who&s;e name the bell is called, was Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Roan,</HI> about the yeere 1500. who con&s;idering that in his Dioce&s;&s;e (&s;uch was the &s;car&s;itie of oile, as it would hardly be &s;ufficient for the time of Lent) granted to his Dioce&s;&s;ans in &s;tead thereof the v&s;e of butter, conditionally that they &s;hould pay &s;ix halfepence Tournois a piece: with which &s;umme of money he cau&s;ed the &s;aid &s;teeple to be built; which thereupon is yet called <HI>Latour de beur;</HI> that is, The &s;teeple of butter. The antiquities, and other memorable matters of this city, <HI>F. Noel Taillipied</HI> hath de&s;cribed in French in a peculiar Trea|ti&s;e. Thus much of <HI>Normandie.</HI></P>
<P>BRETAIGNE bordering vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>Normandie,</HI> is the vtmo&s;t prouince of <HI>France</HI> toward the Ocean. Some thinke that this was of old called <HI>Aremorica.</HI> Sure I am that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> de&s;cribeth cities which he calleth <HI>Aremericas</HI> vpon this coa&s;t. But <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Sidonius</HI> do name the inhabitants <HI>Britannos,</HI> placing them vpon the riuer of <HI>Loire.</HI> The Middle-age writers call them <HI>Brittones,</HI> which name they yet retaine. <HI>Plinie</HI> mo&s;t aptly calles this region, The godlie&s;t Penin&s;ula of <HI>Gallia Lugdu|nen&s;is.</HI> In a fragment of the Frankes hi&s;tory I reade that it was once called <HI>The horne of France;</HI> from the &s;hape thereof, as I &s;uppo&s;e. <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> is of opinion, that the Brittons being named <HI>Hermiones,</HI> tooke occa&s;ion by way of allu&s;ion vnto this name, to make choi&s;e of tho&s;e armes which they now beare, commonly called <HI>Ermines,</HI> with wea&s;els tailes, and the natiue colour of blacke in a field argent &amp;c. This region he &s;aith is &s;omewhat drie, and not very fruitfull; more apt to beare millet than wheat. Their fields (&s;aith he) they call lands. It &s;eemeth more properly to be named <HI>Eremorica</HI> than <HI>Aremorica.</HI> For they make larger leagues betweene towne and towne, namely of three miles; which is no &s;light argument of a barren &s;oile. Hereof the coniecture &s;eemes not improbable, that it was called <HI>Brutannia,</HI> of nouri&s;hing or feeding brute bea&s;ts. So many of their townes (as antiquity reports) are denominated from flocks and droues: as for example, <HI>Pullinaicum, &agrave; pullis equinis,</HI> from hor&s;e-coltes; <HI>Filicieriae,</HI> now called <HI>Fulgeriae,</HI> alias <HI>Foulgeres,</HI> of braky grounds; al&s;o <HI>Rhedones, &agrave; Rhedis,</HI> that is to &s;ay, of carts which cary commodities long and tedious iourneys: which I rather beleeue, than that it fir&s;t borrowed the name from <HI>Brutus.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Caenalis:</HI> let the trueth thereof &s;tand or fall vpon his credit. More concerning the&s;e countries you may reade in the &s;ame authour, and in <HI>Belleforest;</HI> but e&s;pecially in <HI>Bertrard Argentr&eacute;,</HI> who hath publi&s;hed a large volume of the &s;ame in French.

Poictou</HI> is now diuided into the Lower and the Vpper: The Lower <HI>Poictou</HI> we call that which ends We&s;tward vpon the &s;ea of <HI>Aquitaigne:</HI> and the Vpper, which lieth Ea&s;tward towards <HI>Tourain</HI> and <HI>Berry:</HI> South it confines vpon <HI>Xantoigne, Angole&s;me,</HI> and <HI>Limo|&s;in:</HI> and North vpon <HI>Brettaigne</HI> and <HI>Aniou.</HI> It is a countrey mo&s;t fertile of corne and cattell; rich in wheat and wine; and abounding with fi&s;h.

<P>In the yeere of the worlds creation 1791. one <HI>Gomer</HI> of the nation of the Gaules, bringing a Colonie into this region of the Bituriges, planted the &s;ame in the chiefe citie, the name of <HI>Ogygis</HI> being by <HI>Noah</HI> his grandfather impo&s;ed for honours &s;ake vpon the inhabitants: which by them for the fauor and loue they bare to their foun|der de&s;cended of <HI>Ogygis,</HI> was afterward changed: and they named them&s;elues <HI>Bito|gyges,</HI> which in the Armenian tongue &s;ignifies, <HI>The po&s;teritie of</HI> Ogygis.

Concerning euery of which I will &s;peake more largely, hauing &s;aid &s;omwhat of the Metropolitan: whereunto belong the third part of Bi&s;hop-townes, which in times pa&s;t were vnder the ancient iuri&s;diction of <HI>Lugdune.</HI> For vnder the third receiued diui&s;ion of Dioce&s;&s;es apperteining to the Primacie of <HI>Lugdune</HI> or <HI>Lions,</HI> are comprehended <HI>Tours, La Mans, Angiers, Rhenes, Nants, Cornevaile, Vannes, S.

He therefore hauing ended his warres, and put his legions in gari&s;on among the Carnutes, Andes, and Turones, which were cities neere vnto the&s;e places, departed for</HI> Italie. Hence you may gather, that they were not enemies to the Romans, but rather <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> followers. <HI>Gregory Turonen|&s;is</HI> often calles them <HI>Senatores Romanos,</HI> for they enioyed the libertie of Free-denizens, which was granted to none but &s;uch as were the Romans deere friends, and linked vnto them in mo&s;t firme league. The Touranois are held to be one of the riche&s;t people in all <HI>France,</HI> both for the fruitfulne&s;&s;e of their fields (which they de&s;eruedly call <HI>The Kings garden</HI>) and al&s;o for their excellent maner of gouernment, and the indu&s;try of their Citizens, who are e&s;pecially addi|cted to traffique, for which purpo&s;e their nauigable riuer &s;tands them in great &s;tead.

<P>_THis Cart conteineth the de&s;cription of that North-we&s;tern part of <HI>France,</HI> which the Engli&s;h were ma&s;ters of from the yere 1347. vntil the yere 1557. At what time the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> Lieutenant for the French King tooke it by force of armes. The townes of <HI>Calais, Gui&s;nes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres</HI> the Engli&s;h from time to time haue furni&s;hed with able gari&s;ons. And <HI>Calais</HI> hath heretofore beene the Staple for Woolles and other Engli&s;h commodities. Concerning the tract of <HI>Boulongne,</HI> thus &s;aith <HI>Robert Caenalis,</HI> in his 2. book, and 3. Perioche <HI>De re Gallica.</HI> Of <HI>Ge&s;&s;oriacum,</HI> a port of the <HI>Morini,</HI> I may well &s;ay with <HI>Meierus,</HI> that it is now truely called <HI>Boulongne</HI> vpon the &s;ea &s;hore, from whence there is a very &s;hort cut to <HI>Douer</HI> on the Engli&s;h coa&s;t. But the Docke or place for building &s;hips (called <HI>Nauale Ge&s;&s;oriacum,</HI> which <HI>Bilibaldus</HI> fal&s;ely affirmes to be <HI>Gaunt</HI>) I thinke rather to be <HI>Ca|&s;tellum,</HI> now named <HI>Ca&s;&s;ell.</HI> Some by another name call it <HI>Petre&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Scalas,</HI> com|monly <HI>Scales.</HI> Moreouer, by the &s;ituation of <HI>Boulongne</HI> one may ea&s;ily coniecture, whether it were <HI>Portus Iccius</HI> or no. Wherein that no man may doubt, let vs learne this one thing out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> That the &s;ea between <HI>Portus Iccius</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> was iu&s;t 320. <HI>&s;tadia</HI> or furlongs ouer: which make in all 40. miles. But the later Maps containe betweene <HI>Boulongne</HI> and <HI>Douer</HI> 17. Engli&s;h, which are longer than Italian miles, and from <HI>Calais</HI> 18. Whereby it is manife&s;t, that from <HI>Boulongne</HI> to <HI>Douer</HI> it is but a very &s;hort cut: wherefore <HI>Portus Ge&s;&s;oriacus</HI> the hauen, and <HI>Na|uale Ge&s;&s;oriacum</HI> the docke, are not all one: which docke who&s;o thinketh &s;tood where <HI>Calais</HI> now &s;tands, I will not greatly contradict him. Thus farre <HI>Caenalis.</HI></P>
<P>This very place of <HI>Boulongne</HI> is de&s;cribed by <HI>Arnoldus Ferronius</HI> (who continu|ed the French hi&s;tory of <HI>Paulus Aemilius</HI> till his owne time) in maner following. There is (&s;aith he) <HI>Ba&s;e Boulongne,</HI> and <HI>High Boulongne.</HI> The ba&s;e towne was vn|walled before the comming of the Engli&s;h. There &s;tands the church of <HI>S. Nicho|las,</HI> and a cloi&s;ter of Franci&s;cans: the Engli&s;h &s;ea beateth vpon this towne. Neere vnto this Frierie, which is not farre from the &s;ea, there is a very commodious place to pa&s;&s;e for <HI>England.</HI> It is di&s;tant from the higher <HI>Boulongne</HI> about 100. pa&s;es or &s;omewhat more. But <HI>Boulongne</HI> the higher is inuironed with mo&s;t &s;trong walles, and with high ditches compa&s;sing the walles. All this region is full of that &s;and, which tho&s;e that dwell on the coa&s;t call hot &s;and. Whereupon they will haue the name of <HI>Boulongne</HI> to be deriued of the French word that &s;ignifies &s;uch kinde of &s;and, notwith&s;tanding we know it out of <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> to be an ancient name.

<HEAD>PICARDIE.</HEAD>
<P>_THe name of <HI>Picardie,</HI> as all that write of <HI>France</HI> do affirme not to be ancient; &s;o the originall or deriuation thereof none of them can render. <HI>Caenalis</HI> dares not &s;ay, that it was &s;o called of the Be|gardes. <HI>Belleforest</HI> flatly denies it, &s;uppo&s;ing the Picardes to be &s;omewhat ancienter than the Begardes. Some thinke that they were &s;o named of the warlike weapon called the Pike; which, as they imagine, was here fir&s;t inuented. Certaine it is, that the prouince of <HI>Picardy</HI> was larger in times pa&s;t: for we reade that <HI>Artois,</HI> with a part of <HI>Flanders,</HI> as farre as the riuer <HI>Lis,</HI> and the countie of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> were all comprehended vnder the name of <HI>Picardy.</HI> The region which is now properly called <HI>Picardy,</HI> extends not &s;o farre as the Map it &s;elfe.</P>
<P>This Region is part of <HI>Gallia Belgica,</HI> whilom inhabited by the Ambiani, Bel|louaci, and Veromandui, or (as <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calles them) Romandui. The riuer <HI>Somme,</HI> which &s;ome thinke to be <HI>Ptolemey</HI> his Phrudis, refre&s;heth the wole coun|trey, and makes it mo&s;t fertile of all kinde of graine, and the townes and cities to abound with all nece&s;&s;aries: for it yeeldeth &s;uch plentie of wheat, as it is called by an v&s;uall prouerbe, The Barne or Granarie of <HI>Paris.</HI> It hath no vineyards; which defect &s;ome thinke is rather to be imputed to the &s;loth of the inhabitants, than to the intemperature either of the &s;oile, or of the climate.</P>
<P>The cities here, of principall note, are <HI>Amiens,</HI> in Latine <HI>Ambianum,</HI> famous both for antiquitie and the Epi&s;copall &s;ea. It is enuironed around with the riuer <HI>Somme.</HI> Wherefore &s;ome fondly thinke it to be named <HI>Ambianum, ab ambitu aqua|rum,</HI> becau&s;e it is compa&s;&s;ed with waters. It is one of the &s;tronge&s;t townes in all <HI>France.</HI> The vulgar &s;uppo&s;e it to haue beene built by the &s;ouldiers of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great. Vnder the dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Amiens</HI> is <HI>Abbeuile,</HI> the name whereof is new, as appeareth by the deriuation, which in Latine is <HI>Abbatis villa,</HI> that is, The Abbats towne: for out of an Abbey it increa&s;ed at length to the greatne&s;&s;e and forme of a citie. It is now the head citie of the county <HI>Ponthieu;</HI> which region is &s;o called, <HI>&agrave; multitudine pontium,</HI> of the multitude of bridges; becau&s;e it is in diuers places pe&s;te|red with Mar&s;hes and Fennes. <HI>Picquenie</HI> &s;tands in this prouince al&s;o; built as the common &s;ort imagine by one <HI>Pignon</HI> a principall &s;ouldier of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great. Likewi&s;e in <HI>&V;ermandois</HI> you haue the towne of <HI>S. Quintins,</HI> which many &s;uppo&s;e to haue beene <HI>Augusta &V;eromanduorum,</HI> being the ancient &s;eat of the Earles of <HI>Ver|mandois,</HI> and the head of that region. <HI>Peronne</HI> &s;o often &s;poiled in warres, who can be ignorant of? <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> al&s;o &s;eemes to be a Fort again&s;t <HI>Lutzenburgh.</HI> Hence the Gui&s;ian familie deriue their name. Other cities there be of le&s;&s;e moment, as <HI>Corbie, Roye, Nelle, Hen, Cattelette, Mondidier,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In a little French pamphlet intitled <HI>Chemins de France,</HI> or the wayes of <HI>France, Picardy</HI> is diuided into three parts; The Lower, The Higher, and <HI>Picardy</HI> pro|perly &s;o called: wherein are contained the Regions of <HI>&V;ermandois, Retelois, Tarte|nois,</HI> and <HI>Tira&s;&s;e.

If we may credit <HI>Bellefore&s;t,</HI> it beareth &s;ugar about the towne of <HI>Yeres. Manna</HI> is here gathered, as the &s;ame authour affirmeth. The principall cities of this prouince are <HI>Ma&s;silia,</HI> commonly <HI>Mar&s;eille,</HI> which was the ancient <HI>Ionica Colonia,</HI> of the Phocaean Greeks, being as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> 5. <HI>Ciuil.</HI> re|ports, compa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ea on three &s;ides; and on the fourth &s;ide, hauing a pa&s;&s;age to the land. <HI>Strabo</HI> writes, that the hauen is in forme of a Theater, and that within compa&s;&s;e thereof they haue docks for the building, and a &s;torehou&s;e for the furni&s;hing of &s;hips. Here was a temple of the Ephe&s;ian <HI>Diana,</HI> and ano|ther of <HI>Apollo Delphicus.</HI> The citizens were treble-tongued, &s;peaking Greeke, Latine, and French, as S. <HI>Ierome</HI> reporteth out of <HI>Varro.</HI> Of this citie reade more largely in the 43. booke of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> and in a Pane|gyricke &s;peech vttered before <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the great by <HI>Anonymus</HI> or one vnnamed.

Now it may well be called &s;ingle <HI>Arelas,</HI> looking of a farre other &s;hape, and all &s;ituate vpon that &s;ide of the riuer which is towards <HI>Italie.</HI> This, <HI>Ammianus</HI> makes the renowme of many cities. And <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;aith, that heere was a Romane colonie planted by <HI>Tiberius</HI> the Emperor his father. <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmes, that it was heretofore the head citie of the Burgundians. Next followes <HI>Aquae Sextiae,</HI> &s;o called (&s;aith <HI>Strabo</HI>) becau&s;e that very <HI>Sex|tius</HI> which &s;ubdued <HI>Salyes,</HI> built this citie after his owne name, and after the name of certaine hot bathes in the &s;ame place. Now it is corruptly called <HI>Aix.</HI> The&s;e bathes <HI>Strabo</HI> in his time &s;uppo&s;eth to haue turned colde, and &s;o <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> at this pre&s;ent affirmeth, that they haue lo&s;t their ancient vertue. The Parlia|ment of the whole prouince is here re&s;ident. Of this citie <HI>Gabriel Simeonius</HI> writeth, that he neuer &s;aw either a more plea&s;ant place, or a more courteous people. Then haue you the citie <HI>Cabellio,</HI> now called <HI>Cauaillon. Tara&s;con</HI> retaining &s;till the ancient name. <HI>Carpentoracte</HI> commonly <HI>Carpentras. Va&s;io</HI> now <HI>Voiton:</HI> the &s;ame with <HI>Forum Vocontiorum,</HI> as &s;ome thinke. <HI>Taurentum</HI> and <HI>Telo Martius,</HI> which &s;ome now interpret to be <HI>Tou|lon. Forum Iulij,</HI> now <HI>Frejus. Olbia</HI> which perhaps is <HI>Yeres. Antipolis, Antibe. Segu&s;teron, Ci&s;teron. Vintium, Venze. Glanatica, Glandeues. Dinia, Digne. Tecolata</HI> thought to be <HI>S. Maximines. Grinicen&s;is, Gra&s;&s;e.</HI> All famous for an|tiquitie. Moreouer, here is the towne of <HI>S. Baume,</HI> &s;ituate vpon a craggie hill, in which is a caue; where, the inhabitants hold opinion, that <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> did penance, and ended her dayes. Likewi&s;e at the mouth of <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> the reader may &s;ee on the one &s;ide the field called <HI>La Craux;</HI> and on the other &s;ide <HI>La Camargo</HI> This la&s;t named (they &s;ay) is miraculou&s;ly fertile of wheat.

The i&s;les adiacent to this prouince are the Stoechades, di&s;per&s;ed, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> writeth, from the &s;hore of <HI>Liguria</HI> or <HI>Genoa</HI> as farre as <HI>Mar&s;eille. Plinie</HI> makes them three in number, naming ech. And <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith there are three of importance, and two &s;mall ones, not worthy to be mentioned. About the&s;e i&s;les growes mo&s;t excellent Corrall, as <HI>Plinie</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, which <HI>Belleforest</HI> reporteth &s;till to continue. In commendation of this prouince, <HI>Petrus Quinqueranus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sens,</HI> hath written a peculiar volume.</P>
<P>On this &s;ide the riuer <HI>Durance,</HI> this Region bordereth vpon that part of the Popes iuri&s;diction, which is commonly called <HI>Conte de Venacin,</HI> in Latine <HI>Comitatus Venuxinus,</HI> and <HI>Veneticus,</HI> wherein &s;tands the Citie and Vniuer&s;itie of <HI>Auignon,</HI> which in times pa&s;t was the Papall &s;ea, namely from Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the fift in the yeere 1300. till <HI>Gregorie</HI> the &s;econd, for the &s;pace of 60. yeeres. <HI>Petrarch</HI> then called it The French and We&s;terne <HI>Babylon.</HI> Be&s;ides other notable things in this citie, &s;euen there are, &s;euen times told, right worthy the admi|ration; namely, &s;euen Palaces, &s;euen Ho&s;pitals, &s;euen Pari&s;hes, &s;euen Nunries, &s;euen Colleges, &s;euen Frie|ries, and &s;euen gates.

Hereupon a certaine Nobleman hauing obtained it of the Emperour vnder the title of a Dukedome, expelled by force of armes all the &s;aid theeues and robbers, and made the way mo&s;t &s;ecure for trauellers.

<HEAD>LORRAIN.</HEAD>
<P>_THE bounds of <HI>Lorrain</HI> in times pa&s;t extended much farther, for it comprehended in a maner all the whole region lying betweene the riuer <HI>Rhene,</HI> and <HI>Scheld,</HI> and the mountaine <HI>Voga&s;us.</HI> All which was diuided into the higher, and the lower. The lower <HI>Lorrain</HI> contained <HI>Brabant, Ha&s;pengow, Guelders,</HI> and <HI>Cleue.</HI> In the higher were the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Liege,</HI> with the coun|ties of <HI>Lutzenburg,</HI> and <HI>Limburg:</HI> as likewi&s;e the duchy of <HI>Mae&s;land,</HI> the countie Palantine vpon <HI>Sur,</HI> and the territorie of <HI>Hund&s;ruge:</HI> together with this pre&s;ent Dukedome of <HI>Lorrain</HI> retaining as yet the ancient name <HI>Lotharingia,</HI> impo&s;ed by <HI>Lotharius</HI> &s;onne to <HI>Ludouicus Pius,</HI> vnto who&s;e &s;hare it befell: lying in the mid&s;t between <HI>We&s;tra&s;ia</HI> (or as &s;ome vnskilfully call it <HI>Noa&s;tria</HI>) which fell to <HI>Charles,</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia</HI> to <HI>Lewis Lotharius</HI> Brethren. This therefore I thinke not ami&s;&s;e more largely to de&s;cribe, not in mine owne wordes, but in the wordes of <HI>Symphorianus Campeg|gius,</HI> &s;ometimes a famous Phy&s;ition of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> LORRAIN (&s;aith he) ioineth Ea&s;t vpon <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> commonly <HI>El&s;as,</HI> South vpon <HI>Burgundy,</HI> We&s;t vpon <HI>Champaigne,</HI> &amp; North it is bounded vpon the Fore&s;t <HI>Arduenna.</HI> This region albeit compa&s;&s;ed with loftie Alpes, is notwith&s;tanding &s;o fat and fertile, as it need no &s;upply from the neighbour-prouinces: it abounds with cattell great and &s;mall, with meadowes, corne, wine, fi&s;hpooles, high woods, healthfull bathes, &s;altpits, yron, copper, lead, tinne, &s;iluer, precious &s;tones, looking gla&s;&s;es, Calcidons, and is watered by &s;undrie riuers: foure whereof are famous aboue the re&s;t. <HI>Mo&s;a</HI> the fir&s;t of the&s;e foure &s;pringing out of mount <HI>Voge&s;us</HI> (of which mountaine a great and a good part of <HI>Lorraine</HI> is named <HI>Le bois,</HI> and <HI>Le fore&s;t de Voige</HI>) and running along by <HI>Neufcha&s;teau,</HI> a towne very commodious both for plea&s;ant &s;ituation, and whole&s;ome ayer: diuideth the duchie of <HI>Barre</HI> from <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and ca&s;teth it &s;elfe into one of the chanels of <HI>Rhene,</HI> before it falleth into the &s;ea. <HI>Mo&s;ella</HI> the &s;econd beginneth Southea&s;t, not far from the towne of <HI>Rimere|mont;</HI> wherein is a mona&s;tery of Nunnes, all gentlewomen, endowed with large reuenues. About &s;ix miles from hence are certaine hot-bathes whereunto re&s;ort great multitudes of people to cure them&s;elues of &s;undrie di&s;ea&s;es. Then runnes it along with &s;wift &s;treames to the townes of <HI>E&s;pinall, Charmes, Toul</HI> (which in olde time was called <HI>Leuca</HI>) and <HI>Mediomatrices,</HI> now called <HI>Metz:</HI> not farre from whence it falls into the <HI>Rhene,</HI> at a city of <HI>Germany</HI> called of olde <HI>Confluentia,</HI> and now <HI>Cobolentz.</HI> Betweene the&s;e two riuers neere the towne of <HI>Vitell,</HI> is a double fountaine &s;euered like a mans no&s;ethrills, from whence the &s;mall riuer <HI>Vena</HI> i&s;&s;ueth: which &s;ometimes is &s;andy, and &s;ometimes miry, and for the mo&s;t part very vn&s;eemely and forlorne: the waters whereof are commonly dried vp in <HI>Iune,</HI> except the pooles, which the &s;welling and violent &s;treames haue made &s;o deepe. <HI>Murtha</HI> the third riuer falling from certaine rockes of &s;iluer-mines, holdeth on his cour&s;e through the valley of <HI>S. Didier,</HI> wherein is <HI>S. Godeberts</HI> fountaine, which is generally reported to be medicinable for many di&s;ea&s;es. The &s;aid riuer runnes along by the towne of <HI>S. Didier,</HI> and then by the townes of <HI>Raon</HI> and <HI>Luneuill:</HI> all which both for naturall &s;ituation, and for rampiers, and walles are places of &s;ingular defence. Then followes the towne of <HI>S. Nicholas</HI> ge|nerally famous both for abundance of marchandi&s;e, and multitudes of miracles. Lower downe the riuer &s;tands <HI>Nancey,</HI> the principall towne of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> a place for munition, and fortification of great importance. Fir&s;t it is compa&s;&s;ed with two ditches of exceeding depth, and a double wall: al&s;o it hath foure mo&s;t admirable bulwarks, with plenty of warlike engins and artillery. <HI>Murtha</HI> falles into <HI>Mo&s;ell.</HI> And <HI>Sartha</HI> the fourth riuer running along the confines of <HI>We&s;tereich,</HI> a prouince &s;ubiect to <HI>Lorraine</HI> towards the Ea&s;t, holdeth on his cour&s;e by the townes of <HI>Sarburg, Saralben, Sarprucke,</HI> with others, and then falles into <HI>Mo&s;ell.</HI></P>
<P>Now whereas <HI>Lorraine</HI> aboundeth all ouer with &s;peciall commodities; many of them we will omit, and &s;peake only of the mo&s;t principall. Fir&s;t therefore the mountaines of this prouince doe in all kind of mineralls excell euen the <HI>Pyreney</HI> mountaines: wherein, not to &s;peake of the re&s;t, there are diuers &s;iluer-mines, &s;o abounding with that kinde of mettall, as it is incredible what commoditie it yeelds to the whole countrey.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;alt-mines, out of which is digged mo&s;t pure, &s;auorie, and &s;now-white &s;alt: which yeeldeth yerely to the Duke, all charges deducted, 100000. francks.</P>
<P>Heere is found likewi&s;e a kind of matter, whereof they make looking gla&s;&s;es and drinking gla&s;&s;es, the be&s;t, by all mens confe&s;&s;ion, in <HI>Europe:</HI> nor is there in any place the like to be had.</P>
<P>Al&s;o <HI>Calcidons</HI> of &s;o extraordinarie bigne&s;&s;e, that I my &s;elfe &s;aw at the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Toul,</HI> a great cuppe made of one whole piece.</P>
<P>Item, the <HI>Lazul</HI> (or <HI>Azure</HI> &s;tone) repre&s;enting mo&s;t excellent colours. A minerall out of which the miners rai&s;e exceeding gaine.</P>
<P>In the valley of <HI>Voige</HI> are fountaines (a matter memorable, and not to be omitted) &s;o abounding with a kinde of pearles, and precious &s;tones, as the greater part of <HI>Germanie</HI> doth v&s;e them: which all Lapidaries and Iewellers of other countries do not only approue, but al&s;o preferre before the &s;tones and pearles of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>There is a lake of foureteene miles in compa&s;&s;e, &s;tored with carps of huge bigne&s;&s;e; for they are generally of three foot long, and a foot broad; which for plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of ta&s;te, are (in mine opinion) to be preferred before all other &s;tanding-water-carps in <HI>Europe.</HI> The lake is fi&s;hed with nets euery third yeere; the fi&s;hing whereof (as euery man knowes) yeeldeth the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> 16000. francks.</P>
<P>Moreouer, <HI>Lorrain</HI> aboundeth with wheat, wine, cattell of all &s;orts, woods, excellent hor&s;es, which &s;urpa&s;&s;e the Tur|ki&s;h hor&s;es in courage, the Spani&s;h in &s;wiftne&s;&s;e, and the Engli&s;h in &s;tature. In briefe, for tall men and beautifull women; and all things nece&s;&s;ary for mans life, it is inferiour to no other countrie. Thus farre <HI>Symphorianus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Francis Ro&s;eus</HI> very lately wrote a large volume of the pedegree, and famous acts of the Dukes of <HI>Lorraine.</HI> And I my &s;elfe in mine <HI>Itinerarium,</HI> or Iournall, haue publi&s;hed &s;ome things of this Region not vnwoorthie the remembrance.</P>

The cities of the lower <HI>Burgundie</HI> are: SALINS, a large citie, &s;o named in regard of certaine &s;alt and high fountaines; for here is excellent white &s;alt made, which is carried hence in carts to the neighbour countries, and yeelds great reuenue to this region: SCODINGA, &s;ituate in a long &s;treight valley, extending in length betweene a double ridge of high mountaines, which beare vines in &s;uch places as are mo&s;t open to the Sunne: it is ex|ceeding &s;trong, being fortified with two ca&s;tles, and diuers loftie turrets.

It is &s;eated on the bancke of <HI>O&s;carus</HI> (com|monly <HI>Ou&s;ch</HI>) a riuer abounding with fi&s;h, in a fertile and plentifull &s;oile, the moun|taines adiacent yeelding &s;trong and excellent wines: as the &s;aid <HI>Turonen&s;is</HI> reporteth, who mo&s;t learnedly de&s;cribes it. Some thinke it was built by the Emperour <HI>Aurelian;</HI> but others affirme it to be much ancienter. It is a citie both by arte and nature mo&s;t &s;trongly fortified again&s;t all ho&s;tile attempts, certaine new forts being lately added. <HI>Belna</HI> (commonly <HI>Beaulne</HI>) is the &s;econd citie of the Dukedome, famous for the wines of <HI>Beaulne,</HI> which all men commend. This Citie is fairely built, being impregnable in regard of a Ca&s;tle which <HI>Lewis</HI> the twelfth erected here. It hath an ho&s;pitall comparable for building to any Kings Palace. Here al&s;o is the &s;eat of the high court of Chancery. In the territorie adiacent was built by Duke <HI>Otho</HI> about the yeere of our Lord 1098. the abbey of <HI>Cistertium;</HI> in a woody and clammy &s;oile, which &s;ome thinke was &s;o called in regard of certaine Ci&s;ternes there digged. Vnder the iuri&s;diction of this Mona&s;terie <HI>Belleforest</HI> reporteth, that there are 1800. other Mona&s;teries of Friers, and as many of Nunnes.</P>
<P>Next followes <HI>Augu&s;todunum</HI> (which &s;ome, though vpon no &s;ufficient grounds of antiquitie, &s;uppo&s;e to haue beene called <HI>Bibracte</HI>) now <HI>Auttun.</HI> That this citie of ancient times was mo&s;t large and populous, it is euident out of &s;undry authours, and e&s;pecially out of <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> Here are yet extant mightie ruines of a Thea|ter, of Statues, Pillars, Water-chanels, Pyramides, and many other monuments of antiquitie. Likewi&s;e here are dayly digged vp coines, little ve&s;&s;els, and other &s;uch ancient fragments. This citie hath endured two memorable ouerthrowes: one by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his French warres; and the other about the time of <HI>Galienus</HI> the Emperour. But it was afterward reedified by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Claudius,</HI> as the Panegyrick of <HI>Eu|menius,</HI> calling it <HI>Flauiam Heduorum,</HI> doth te&s;tifie. And at this very day it is adorned with &s;tately temples, and other buildings for publicke v&s;es.</P>
<P>Then haue you <HI>Mati&s;cona Cae&s;aris,</HI> or <HI>Mati&s;conen&s;e ca&s;trum Antonini,</HI> where he placeth in garri&s;on the tenth Roman legion. It is now called <HI>Ma&s;con.</HI> Of olde it was graced with the title of an Earledome. It ioyneth the bancks of <HI>Araris</HI> by a bridge. Here, the Lords day of the Chri&s;tians began fir&s;t to be hallowed, as <HI>Pa|radine</HI> reporteth out of the Edict of <HI>Guntram.</HI> The relation of the citie of <HI>Ma&s;con, Philip Bugnonius</HI> hath ele|gantly, and briefly &s;et downe. <HI>Cabilonum,</HI> now <HI>Chalon,</HI> vpon the bancke of <HI>Araris</HI> al&s;o, anciently called <HI>Or|bandale,</HI> as reporteth <HI>Peter Sanjulian.</HI> By <HI>Antoninus</HI> the foureteenth Roman legion was here put in garri&s;on. It was of olde the royall &s;eat of <HI>Guntram,</HI> which notwith&s;tanding afterward <HI>Lotharius</HI> &s;onne to <HI>Ludouicus Pi|us</HI> &s;o de&s;troyed and aboli&s;hed with fire, as he left no mention at all of a citie: yet now it is very rich, and a place of great trafficke. Al&s;o toward the North you haue <HI>Semur,</HI> a faire towne built vpon an high ground. As like <HI>Ca&s;tillon, Flauigni, Soloigne, Noiers,</HI> with others, the de&s;cription whereof, becau&s;e this page cannot well containe, I referre the Reader to <HI>Bellefore&s;t,</HI> a diligent Surueyer of the&s;e parts. Only one thing I will adde out of the fore&s;aid <HI>Sanjulian.</HI> He again&s;t the opinion of all other Writers, deriueth this word <HI>Burgun|die,</HI> not <HI>&agrave; burgis,</HI> that is, from the boroughs or incorporate townes built in this region, but from one parti|cular place called <HI>Burg Ogne.</HI> In the territorie of <HI>Langren</HI> about the riuer <HI>Tille,</HI> betweene <HI>Luz</HI> and <HI>Tille-castle,</HI> he &s;aith there is a plaine which the inhabitants call by no other name but <HI>Val d'Ogne:</HI> where in times pa&s;t &s;tood a famous borough or city. Hence without all que&s;tion he affirmes, that the Burgundians, or as they are commonly called <HI>Burgognons,</HI> do borow their name; and holds tho&s;e Writers much deceiued, that re|port them, as vagabond people, to haue come out of <HI>Sarmatia, Scandia,</HI> or the fennes of <HI>Maeotis</HI> to inhabit this region; indeuouring to per&s;uade all men that they were the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ancient inhabiters of this countrey.</P>

<HEAD>GERMANIE.</HEAD>
<P>_GERMANIE, the greate&s;t and large&s;t countrey of <HI>Europe,</HI> is di&s;tingui&s;hed by many names: the limits whereof by authours, according to euery ones &s;euerall time, are &s;o diuer&s;ly de&s;cribed, as they &s;eeme, applying them&s;elues to the pecu|liar ages wherein they liued, to giue notice of a threefold <HI>Germanie;</HI> namely, the ancient, that of middle ages, and <HI>Germanie</HI> as it is now taken. The ancient is that of <HI>Bero&s;us,</HI> which he circum&s;cribeth by the <HI>Rhene,</HI> the Ocean, the riuer <HI>Tanais,</HI> the Euxine &s;ea, and the riuer <HI>Danubius.</HI> That of middle ages is the &s;ame which <HI>Taci|tus, Ptolemey,</HI> and <HI>Plinie,</HI> all of one time acknowledged: whereof, becau&s;e it is &s;uf|ficiently knowen out of the authours them&s;elues, I hold it needle&s;&s;e in this place to make any de&s;crip|tion. But <HI>Germanie</HI> as it is now taken, we do confine by the German or Dutch tongue; which learned <HI>Goropius Becanus</HI> in his volume of the antiquities of nations, mo&s;t wittily and learnedly &s;heweth to be the anciente&s;t language in the world. Wherfore all tho&s;e countries which at this day v&s;e the &s;ame lan|guage, we comprehend vnder the name of <HI>Germany.</HI> And &s;o the greate&s;t length thereof &s;tretcheth from <HI>Calais</HI> on the We&s;t to the riuer <HI>Vi&s;tula</HI> or <HI>VVixel</HI> Ea&s;tward: and the large&s;t bredth from the German and Baltick &s;eas to the Alpes. The names of the &s;euerall regions are the&s;e, <HI>Flanders</HI> (the mo&s;t We&s;terly) <HI>Brabant, Zeland, Holland, Fri&s;land, Denmarke, Meckleburgh, Pomerland, Pru&s;sia,</HI> which extendeth beyond the riuer <HI>Vi&s;tula</HI> towards the Baltick &s;ea: as likewi&s;e the ancient and new Marque&s;ates, <HI>Saxonie, VVe&s;tphalia, Gelders, Cleueland, Iuliers,</HI> the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Colen, He&s;&s;en, Turingen, Mi&s;nia, Lu&s;atia, Sile&s;ia, Morauia, Bohe|mia, Franconia,</HI> the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Mentz, Lutzenburg,</HI> the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Triers,</HI> the Countie Palatine, <HI>El&s;as, VVertenberg, Sueuia, Bauaria, Au&s;tria, Stiria, Carinthia, Tirolis,</HI> and <HI>Switzerland</HI> next vnto <HI>France.</HI> There be al&s;o more names of pettie regions, but &s;uch as are either of no great moment, or comprehended vn|der the former. And albeit <HI>Bohemia</HI> &s;peaketh not the German but the Sclauonian tongue, yet becau&s;e it is &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of <HI>Germanie,</HI> and the King thereof is one of the Prince-electours, it is al&s;o num|bred among&s;t the German prouinces.</P>
<P>This countrey of <HI>Germanie,</HI> which for the pre&s;ent is adorned with the title of the Roman Empire, is &s;o repleni&s;hed with beautifull and &s;trong cities, ca&s;tles, villages and inhabitants, as it is no whit inferi|our to <HI>Italie, France,</HI> or <HI>Spaine:</HI> for corne, wine, and riuers abounding with fi&s;h, it may compare with the mo&s;t fruitfull regions Here are fountaines of water, hot bathes, and &s;alt-mines in abundance: and for plentie of mettals, namely, gold, &s;iluer, lead, tinne, bra&s;&s;e, and iron, no countrey &s;hall euer go beyond it. Moreouer, you &s;hall no where finde more courteous and ciuill behauiour, more hone&s;t and com|ly attire, more skill and furniture for the warres, nor greater &s;tore of nobilitie. This is the place that whilome (as <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> affirmeth) was either darkened with woods, or drowned with fennes. <HI>Such changes can &s;ucceeding times affourd,</HI> as &s;aith the Poet.</P>
<P>Of late Writers it hath beene diligently de&s;cribed by <HI>Beatus Rhenanus, Munster</HI> in his Co&s;mography, <HI>Franci&s;cus Irenicus, Iohannes Auentinus</HI> in his Chronicle of <HI>Lyonnois:</HI> Briefly by <HI>Bilibaldus Pirkeimerus, Iohan|nes Bohemus Aubames: Gerardus Nouiomagus, Conradus Peutingerus, Conradus Celtes</HI> a Poet, <HI>Iacobus VVimfelingius</HI> of <HI>Slet&s;tade, Aimon</HI> in the beginning of his French &s;torie, and <HI>Henry Pantalion</HI> at the entrance of his fir&s;t booke of <HI>Pro&s;opographia. Seba&s;tian Brand</HI> hath &s;et downe many iourneys, di&s;tances of places, and cour|&s;es of riuers in this countrey. The riuer <HI>Rhene</HI> is de&s;cribed by <HI>Bernard Mollerus</HI> in ver&s;e, and by <HI>Mag|nus Gruberus</HI> in pro&s;e. <HI>Iohn Herold</HI> hath written two &s;hort Treati&s;es of this region: one of the Romans mo&s;t ancient &s;tations in olde <HI>Germanie;</HI> and another of certeine colonies of theirs on the &s;hore of <HI>Rhae|tia. Ga&s;par Bru&s;chius</HI> publi&s;hed a volume of the mona&s;teries of <HI>Germanie.</HI> Of ancient writers <HI>Cornelius Ta|citus</HI> mo&s;t exactly de&s;cribed it in a peculiar Treati&s;e: whereon <HI>Andraeas Althamerus, Iodocus VVillichius,</HI> and lately <HI>Iu&s;tus Lip&s;ius</HI> haue written mo&s;t learned Commentaries. Diuers other Writers of <HI>Germanie,</HI> which we haue not as yet &s;eene, are reckened vp by <HI>Francis Irenicus,</HI> in the fir&s;t booke and &s;econd chapter of his Expo&s;ition of <HI>Germanie.</HI> But here I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to alledge the te&s;timonie of <HI>Laonicus Chalco|condylas</HI> a &s;tranger, namely of <HI>Athens,</HI> concerning this countrey and the inhabitants. Thus therefore he writeth in his &s;econd booke: <Q REND="inline">This nation is gouerned with better lawes than any other of tho&s;e regi|ons or peoples that inhabit towards the North or We&s;t. It hath many noble and flouri&s;hing cities, which v&s;e their owne lawes, mo&s;t agreeable to equitie. It is diuided into &s;undry principalities, and is &s;ubiect to Prie&s;ts and Bi&s;hops adhering to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome.</HI> The mo&s;t famous and wel-gouerned cities in the vpper and lower <HI>Germanie,</HI> are <HI>Norinberg</HI> a rich city, <HI>Stra&s;burg, Hamburg,</HI> &amp;c. The nation is very populous and mighty; ruleth farre and wide all the world ouer; and in greatne&s;&s;e is &s;econd to the Scythians or Tartars. Wherefore if they were at concord and vnder one Prince, then might they well be deemed inuincible, and the mo&s;t pui&s;&s;ant of nations. As touching their bodies, they are verie healthfull, and want nothing. Nor is there any nation that I know gouerned by better lawes. Thus much and more concerning this people and countrey, who li&s;t may reade in the &s;ame authour.</Q></P>

<HEAD>GERMANIE on this &s;ide RHENE, commonly called THE NETHERLANDS or THE LOW COVNTRIES.</HEAD>
<P>_THis Table repre&s;enteth not all the Lower <HI>Germanie,</HI> but only that part which King <HI>Philip,</HI> &s;onne to <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, challenged by right of inheritance. And it conteineth the&s;e 17. Prouinces; the Dukedomes of <HI>Brabant, Limburgh, Lutzenburg,</HI> and <HI>Guelders;</HI> the Earledomes of <HI>Flanders, Artois, Henault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, Zutfen;</HI> the Marque&s;at of the &s;acred Empire; the Signiories of <HI>Fri&s;land, Mechlin, Vtreight, Oueri&s;&s;ell,</HI> and <HI>Groemingen.</HI> Regions as ciuill and as well manured as any in the world; wherein (according to <HI>Guicciardin</HI>) are to the number of 208. cities fortified with walles, rampiers, or ditches; and villages with churches aboue 6300, be&s;ides a great number of hamlets, ca&s;tles and forts. And this tract (beginning from the Ea&s;t maretine part at the riuer <HI>Ami&s;us,</HI> commonly <HI>Eems,</HI> the bound hereof towards the Ocean) hath the&s;e bordering Princes: the Earle of Ea&s;t <HI>Friez,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Munster,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Cleue,</HI> the Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Colen</HI> and <HI>Triers,</HI> and the French King, along the Southwe&s;terne &s;hore as farre as the riuer <HI>Aa,</HI> the extreame We&s;terne bound of the&s;e Prouinces. The aire, though it may &s;eeme ouer-moi&s;t, is notwith&s;tanding mo&s;t healthfull, and agreeable to the con&s;titution and dige&s;tion of the inhabitants; who are heere very long liued e&s;pecially in <HI>Kempenland,</HI> the Northermo&s;t part of <HI>Brabant.</HI> It is euery where watered with riuers; and &s;ufficiently adorned with woods and groues, either for pa&s;time of hunting, or beautifull pro&s;pect. Mountaines it hath none, &s;aue only about <HI>Lutzenburg, Namur,</HI> and in <HI>Henault,</HI> where it ri&s;eth in &s;ome places into hilles. It aboundeth with corne and fruits of all &s;orts, and medicinable herbs. Here al&s;o groweth great plentie of that graine, which commonly is called <HI>Buckwey,</HI> but the people corruptly pronounce it <HI>Bockwey;</HI> as if you would &s;ay, The Beech-herbe: for the &s;eed or graine (albeit le&s;&s;e in forme) is three-&s;quare, altogether like the nut of the Beech. So as it may truely be called Beech-ma&s;t, or if you will <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. Whether this &s;imple were knowen of ancient times, let Herbali&s;ts enquire. Howbeit, in &s;ome &s;andie places, which the inhabitants, in regard of abundance of heath or linge, call Heath-ground; as in <HI>Kempenland</HI> the North part of <HI>Brabant,</HI> it growes not in &s;uch plentie. But this kinde of heath yeeldes &s;uch excellent feed for cattell, as (by the confe&s;&s;ion of neighbour-countries) their fle&s;h is as plea&s;ant and delectable to a mans ta&s;te, as any other. This region I &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Plinie</HI> in his 17. booke and 4. chapter mo&s;t truely de&s;cribeth, when he &s;aith: <HI>What better feed than the pa&s;tures of</HI> Germanie? <HI>And yet vnder a thin flag you haue immediatly a mould of barren &s;and.</HI> It bree|deth no creatures hurtfull to mankinde.</P>
<P>All the fore&s;aid regions, the greate&s;t part of &s;trangers (mo&s;t ignorantly mi&s;taking part for the whole) call by the name of <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the inhabitants Flemings, whereas <HI>Flanders</HI> is but a part only, and but one Prouince of the &s;euenteene; as in the Table you may plainly &s;ee. The&s;e therefore are in as great an error, as if a man, to &s;ignifie <HI>Spaine,</HI> &s;hould name <HI>Ca&s;tilia, An|daluzia,</HI> or any other particular Prouince: or &s;peaking of <HI>Italie,</HI> &s;hould mention <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> or <HI>Calabria</HI> &amp;c. or di&s;cour&s;ing of the whole kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould nominate only <HI>Normandy</HI> or <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o &s;hould imagine him&s;elfe to haue &s;po|ken of all <HI>Spaine,</HI> all <HI>Italie,</HI> or all <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e regions <HI>Iohn Goropius Becanus</HI> in his <HI>Becce&s;elanis</HI> hath mo&s;t learnedly de&s;cribed, as likewi&s;e <HI>Peter Diuaeus</HI> of <HI>Louaine,</HI> and <HI>Hubert Thomas</HI> of <HI>Liege. Iohannes Caluetus Stella,</HI> a Spaniard, writ in his owne language a Iournall of King <HI>Philips</HI> pro|gre&s;&s;e thorow all the&s;e Prouinces; wherein you &s;hall finde many particulars worth the reading, that giue great light to the knowledge of the&s;e countries and cities. But who&s;o de&s;ires to haue more full and ab&s;olute in&s;tructions of the&s;e places, let him peru&s;e <HI>Guicciardin;</HI> and he will then thinke, that he hath not read of the&s;e Prouinces, but &s;eene them with his eyes. Late|ly al&s;o <HI>Dauid Chitraeus</HI> in his Saxon hi&s;torie hath written both largely and learnedly of the &s;ame argument.</P>
<P>Whereas the inhabitants in mo&s;t places &s;peake both the Dutch and French languages, and the countrey for traffique and other occa&s;ions is frequented by Spaniards and &s;trangers of &s;undry nations; hence it is that diuers cities, townes, and riuers, are called by more names than one: for euery man calles them according to his owne language, by a name much differing from the proper name v&s;ed by the inhabitants. The ignorance of which multiplicitie of names hath made &s;ome authours (o|therwi&s;e not to be di&s;commended) to fall into intolerable errours: and among&s;t the re&s;idue, <HI>Dominicus Niger</HI> in his Geogra|phie; who puts downe <HI>Anuer&s;a</HI> in &s;tead of <HI>Tarauanna;</HI> and <HI>Antorpia</HI> (which notwith&s;tanding in the copie printed by <HI>Hen|rick Peter&s;on</HI> he corruptly calles <HI>Antropicia</HI>) he placeth vpon the banke of <HI>Tabuda,</HI> thirty leagues from <HI>Tarauanna;</HI> whereas all men know, that <HI>Antorpia</HI> and <HI>Anuer&s;a</HI> &s;ignifie one and the &s;ame citie of <HI>Antwerpe.</HI> Likewi&s;e <HI>Machelen</HI> and <HI>Malines, Leodi|um</HI> and <HI>Liege, Nouiomagum</HI> and <HI>Nieumeghen, Traiectum</HI> on the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Trait</HI> (for which he fal&s;ly writes <HI>Trecia</HI>) he &s;uppo|&s;eth to be two &s;euerall townes, ech couple; whereas in very deed they &s;ignifie but one. The citie <HI>Raremutium</HI> al&s;o he mo&s;t gro&s;ly affirmeth to be called <HI>Liege:</HI> and in another place he will needs haue the &s;ame <HI>Raremutium</HI> to be named <HI>Rhamon:</HI> but by his de&s;cription I coniecture, that he meanes by his <HI>Raremutium</HI> and <HI>Rhamon</HI> nothing els but the towne of <HI>Ruermond.</HI> So <HI>Rhenen</HI> a citie of Guelders &s;tanding on the banke of the riuer <HI>Rhene,</HI> in regard of the affinitie of name, he takes to be all one with the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Rhemes</HI> in the Prouince of <HI>Champaigne</HI> in <HI>France.</HI> But being vtterly vnacquainted with the &s;tate of our countries, his errors may &s;eeme the more pardonable. Howbeit, le&s;t others, &s;tudious in Geography, &s;hould fall into the like ab&s;urdities, I thought good to annex vnto this page the co~mon &s;ynonymas or &s;undry names of certaine particular places.</P>

<HEAD>The Dukedome of LVTZENBVRG.</HEAD>
<P>_THis region as we &s;ee many others, is &s;o named of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> the princi|pall citie: but why it &s;hould be thus called, we cannot ea&s;ilie coniecture. At fir&s;t it went vnder the title of an Earledome, and afterward was ad|uanced to the dignitie of a Dukedome, and &s;o till this pre&s;ent continueth. Some &s;ay it was thus aduanced by <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> King of the Romans; others, by <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth: howbeit <HI>Conradus Vercerius</HI> a&s;cribes it to <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;euenth, the first Romane Emperour of that family. I finde in ancient manu|&s;cripts, that the first Earle of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> was one <HI>Sigisfridus,</HI> and that he was the &s;onne of <HI>Tacuinus</HI> Duke of <HI>Mae&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>In former times <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> was part of <HI>Triers.</HI> It &s;tretcheth from the wood <HI>Arduen|na</HI> to <HI>Mo&s;ella</HI> (a riuer by <HI>Au&s;onius</HI> much celebrated.) The countries bordering vpon this Prouince, are part of <HI>France, Loraigne, Metz, Triers, Mamure,</HI> and <HI>Liege.</HI> It is in most places mountainous and woodie; but here and there al&s;o well manured: and of late we &s;ee their woods euery where turned vp and conuerted into most fruitfull fields. The people are for the greatest part Dutch, and yet their countrie ioyneth hard vpon <HI>France,</HI> and they are accustomed to the language and fa&s;hions of the <HI>French.</HI> This Dukedome conteineth in com|pa&s;&s;e, as &s;aith <HI>Guicciardin,</HI> &s;euentie of our Flemi&s;h miles. Within it are &s;euen Earledomes, many Baronies, and great &s;tore of gentlemen. Cities there are with &s;tone walles to the number of twentie three, be&s;ides tho&s;e that the furie of warre hath layd de&s;olate: with <HI>1168.</HI> villages, and &s;undrie castles of importance.</P>
<P>The principall citie is called <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> or <HI>Lucemburg;</HI> for I find it both wayes writ|ten, but without any choice: becau&s;e both the true maner of writing and the deriuation is vn|certaine. Some thinke of the riuer <HI>Elza</HI> running by this citie (which perhaps was <HI>Antoni|nus</HI> his <HI>Alizontia</HI>) that it might be called <HI>Elzenburg,</HI> and corruptly <HI>Lelzenburg.</HI> Others referre it to the fabulous historie of the Inchantre&s;&s;e <HI>Melu&s;ina.</HI> But my purpo&s;e is neither to proue nor di&s;proue &s;uch opinions. Here re&s;ideth the chiefe Coun&s;ell, and the highest Court of iustice. The citie is of &s;ufficient force, but vnequally &s;ituate: for &s;tanding partly on a hill, and partly in a lowe and &s;teepe valley, it appeares of a very vneuen &s;hape. Then haue you <HI>Arlune</HI> &s;tanding on the top of a hill, a towne very beautifull, where at this pre&s;ent are found &s;undry monuments of antiquitie, which <HI>Count Peter Erne&s;tus</HI> hath cau&s;ed to be tran&s;ported to his &s;tately Palace in the citie of <HI>Lutzenburg.</HI> Some are of opinion that the Moone in time past was here after a Gentili&s;h maner adored, and that it was called <HI>Arlune, qua&s;i Ara lunae,</HI> that is, the altar of the moone. Others imagine, that the&s;e cities following borowed their names al&s;o from the re&s;idue of the planets; as <HI>Iuo&s;ium</HI> (commonly <HI>Iuoix</HI>) from <HI>Ioue</HI> or <HI>Iupiter; Sathenacum</HI> (now <HI>Soleure</HI>) from <HI>Saturne; Virtonium</HI> (alias <HI>Verton</HI>) from <HI>Venus; Maruilla</HI> (or <HI>Maruille</HI>) from <HI>Mars; Malmedium (Malmedi)</HI> from <HI>Mercurie.</HI> Some interpret <HI>Malmedi, Montem maledictum,</HI> The accur&s;ed mountaine; &s;aying that it was &s;o called, becau&s;e here the Emperour <HI>Valentinian</HI> lo&s;t his armie.

<P>_GVELDERLAND the &s;eat of the ancient <HI>Sicambri</HI> (as mo&s;t Writers are of opini|on) hath to the North thereof <HI>Fri&s;land,</HI> together with an inlet of the German &s;ea, commonly called <HI>Suiderzee;</HI> Ea&s;t it confineth vpon the Duchy of <HI>Cleue;</HI> South vpon <HI>Gulick;</HI> and We&s;t it affronteth <HI>Brabant</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> It is a champian coun|trey, de&s;titute of mountaines, but all ouer repleni&s;hed with woods and groues. It aboundeth with all nece&s;&s;aries, e&s;pecially with corne; and their greene ranke medowes yeeld &s;uch plentie of feed for cattell, as euen out of the farthe&s;t part of <HI>Denmarke</HI> they bring hither their &s;tarued droues for &s;uccour. It is watered with three famous riuers, namely <HI>Rhijne, Mae&s;e,</HI> and <HI>VVaele.</HI> It conteineth the countie of <HI>Zutphen</HI> and the re|gion called <HI>De Veluvve.</HI> The <HI>Veluwe</HI> is almo&s;t an i&s;le, which being &s;ituate betweene a branch of <HI>Rhijn</HI> that runnes by <HI>Arnhem,</HI> and the riuer <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> &s;tretcheth to the Suyder &s;ea; it is meanly fruitfull and not al|together void of woods, mountaines, and hilles. Some thinke that the inhabitants of this place were woont to be called Caninfates.</P>
<P>The Dukedome of <HI>Guelders</HI> hath two and twentie cities compa&s;&s;ed with walles and ditches, and a|boue three hundred villages. <HI>Nieumegen</HI> vpon the <HI>VVaele</HI> is the Metropolitan; a citie very populous, and gallantly built, &amp; famous in regard of the mint that is there. The greate&s;t part of the citizens v&s;ing trade of merchandize are exceeding rich. The territory of this citie is adorned with the title of a King|dome. Next followes <HI>Ruremonde,</HI> &s;ituate where the riuer <HI>Roer</HI> falles into the <HI>Mae&s;e.</HI> It hath in my re|membrance beene a Bi&s;hopricke. <HI>Zutphen,</HI> at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Berkel,</HI> where it di&s;chargeth it &s;elfe into <HI>Y&s;&s;el.</HI> It beares the title of an Earledome. It hath a rich College of Canons, and is vnder the iuri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Munster. Arnhen</HI> &s;tands vpon the banke of <HI>Rhijne.</HI> This is the &s;eat of the high Court of iu&s;tice, and of the Chancery. The Clergie of this towne are &s;ubiect to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Vtrecht.</HI> HATTEM a towne well fortified vpon the riuer <HI>Y&s;&s;el.</HI> ELBVRG on the &s;hore of the Zuyder &s;ea. HARDERVVIIK, vpon the &s;ame &s;hore. Heere likewi&s;e you haue WAGENING, TIEL, BOMMEL, BRONCHORST, DOESBVRG, DOTECHEM, SHEERENBERG, gouerned by a peculiar prince vnder the name of an Earledome; LOCHEN, GROLL, BREDEVORD, GELRE which perhaps gaue name to the whole region; STRAELEN, VENLO, a towne vpon the banke of <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> fortified both by arte and nature; WACHTENDVNCK, of ancient times the city of <HI>Her|cules,</HI> in the Dukedome of <HI>Iuliers.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e there are other &s;mall townes of note; which though now either by furie of warre, or iniurie of time, they are vnwalled; yet they doe enioy the freedomes and priuileges of cities. Their names be <HI>Keppel, Burg, Genderen, Bateburg, Monteford, Echt, Culeburg,</HI> and <HI>Buren;</HI> both which haue a peculiar Lord as <HI>Bateburg</HI> al&s;o. Vnder Earle <HI>Ottho</HI> the third, this region was mightily inlarged; for he compa&s;&s;ed with walles, and endowed with priuileges the townes of <HI>Rure|mond, Arnhem, Harderwijk, Bemel, Goch,</HI> and <HI>VVagening,</HI> which till that time had remained villages. In the Chronicle of <HI>Iohn Reiger&s;beg</HI> written in Dutch, I finde this region in the time of <HI>Carolus Caluus</HI> to haue beene called by the name of <HI>Ponthis;</HI> and that it was by him in the yeere 878. erected to a Signiorie. Then in the yeere 1079. this Signiorie of <HI>Ponthis</HI> was by <HI>Henrie</HI> the third adorned with the title of an Earledome, and called the Earledome of <HI>Guelders:</HI> and the fir&s;t Earle thereof was <HI>Otto &agrave; Na&s;&s;au.</HI> It went vnder the name of an Earledome till <HI>Reinhold</HI> the &s;econd. But whenas this <HI>Reinhold</HI> not only for his va|lour and mightine&s;&s;e grew terrible to his neighbours, but renowmed in regard of his iu&s;tice, his piety and fidelity towards the Roman empire; he was at <HI>Frankford</HI> in a &s;olemne and royal a&s;&s;embly by <HI>Lewes</HI> the Emperour con&s;ecrated Duke; in pre&s;ence of the King of <HI>England,</HI> the French King, and the Princes Electours, in the yeere of our Lord 1339.</P>
<P>Some &s;ay, that in the time of the Emperour <HI>Carolus Caluus,</HI> towards that place where the towne of <HI>Gelre</HI> now &s;tandeth, there was a &s;trange and venimous bea&s;t, of huge bigne&s;&s;e and mon&s;trous crueltie, feared all the countrey ouer, which lay for the mo&s;t part vnder an Oake. This mon&s;ter wa&s;ted the fields, deuoured cattell great and &s;mall, and ab&s;tained not from men. The inhabitants affrighted with the noueltie and vncouthne&s;&s;e of the matter, abandoned their habitations, and hid them&s;elues in de|&s;ert and &s;olitarie places. A certaine Lord of <HI>Ponth</HI> had two &s;onnes; who partly tendring their owne e|&s;tate, and partly al&s;o the di&s;tre&s;&s;e of their neighbours, a&s;&s;ailed the bea&s;t with &s;ingular policie and cou|rage, and after a long combat &s;lew him. The &s;aid Lord therefore not farre from the Mae&s;e vpon the banke of <HI>Nier&s;on,</HI> for the perpetuall memorie of his &s;onnes exploit, built a ca&s;tle which he called <HI>Gelre;</HI> becau&s;e when the bea&s;t was &s;laine, he often yelled with a dreadfull roaring noi&s;e, <HI>Gelre, Gelre:</HI> from whence they &s;ay, began the name of the Guelders. Thus much out of the Chronicle of <HI>Henry Aquilius</HI> a Guelder borne. More concerning this Prouince you may reade in <HI>Francis Irenicus;</HI> but a mo&s;t large de&s;cription hereof you &s;hall finde in <HI>Guicciardin.</HI></P>

<P>_IT is a common and con&s;tant opinion, that tho&s;e which we now call <HI>Leodien|&s;es</HI> or <HI>Ligeois</HI> are a German people named of old <HI>Eburones.</HI> A relique or monument of which ancient name remaineth as yet in the village <HI>Ebure,</HI> a German mile di&s;tant from the city of <HI>Liege.</HI> And this very place (as I &s;up|po&s;e) is de&s;cribed by <HI>Dion lib. 40.</HI> vnder the name <HI>Eburonia.</HI> Howbeit certaine it is, that the iuri&s;diction of <HI>Liege</HI> &s;tretcheth much farther than that of the Eburones did of olde. Of the Eburones mention is made by <HI>Strabo, Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Florus. Dion</HI> calles them <HI>Eburos:</HI> and late Writers barbarou&s;ly terme them <HI>Eburonates.</HI> Them&s;elues in their mother tongue (which is a kinde of broken French) they call <HI>Ligeois:</HI> but in high Dutch <HI>Lutticher,</HI> and <HI>Luyckenaren.</HI> The deriuation of Eburones &amp; Leodien&s;es, who&s;o de&s;ires to know, I re|fer him to the antiquities of <HI>Goropius Becanus,</HI> and to a &s;mall pamphlet of <HI>Hubert Leodius.</HI></P>
<P>This region taketh vp a great part of ancient <HI>Lorraigne:</HI> for it containes vnder the name of the dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Liege,</HI> the dukedome of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> the marque&s;at of <HI>Franckmont,</HI> the countie of <HI>Ha&s;pengow,</HI> and Loots, and many Baronies. In this region be&s;ides <HI>Mae&s;tright,</HI> halfe wherof is &s;ub|iect to the Duke of <HI>Brabant,</HI> there are foure and twentie walled cities, a thou&s;and &s;euen hundred Villages, with Churches and many Abbeys and Signiories. The names of the cities are the&s;e fol|lowing; <HI>Liege</HI> vpon <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> the &s;eat of a Bi&s;hop, after which all the whole countrey is named: <HI>Bouillon Franchemont, Loots, Borchworm, Tungeren, Huy, Ha&s;&s;elt, Dinant, Ma|&s;ac, Stoch, Bil&s;en, S.

More|ouer <HI>Placentius</HI> writeth, that part of <HI>Mae&s;tright</HI> was added to this dioce&s;&s;e by the donation of <HI>Pori</HI> Earle of <HI>Louaine.</HI> The territorie of this citie is called the countie of <HI>Mae&s;land</HI> in the an|cient records of <HI>Seruatius</HI> abbey, built here by King <HI>Arnulphus</HI> in the yeere <HI>889.</HI> Now this countie is v&s;ually called <HI>Ha&s;pengow.</HI></P>
<P>It is a region exceeding plea&s;ant and fertile of all things, e&s;pecially on the North part, where it ioyneth to <HI>Brabant;</HI> for there it aboundeth with corne and all kinde of fruits, and in &s;ome pla|ces it yeeldeth wine. But on the South frontiers towards <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> it is &s;ome|what more barren, mountainous, and ouer&s;pred with woods; here yet being &s;ome remainder of <HI>Ar|duenna</HI> the greate&s;t fore&s;t in all <HI>France,</HI> as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> writeth. This is the outward hiew of the coun|try; but in the entrals and bowels thereof it is enriched with mettals and &s;undry kinds of marbles; as al&s;o with &s;ea-coales, which they burne in &s;tead of fewell; and all the&s;e &s;o &s;urpa&s;sing good, as in a common prouerbe they v&s;ually &s;ay, that they haue <HI>bread better than bread, fire hotter than fire, and iron harder than iron.</HI> By their iron (than which all the prouinces around v&s;e nei|ther better nor indeed any other) they rai&s;e a great reuenue. Nor with any other more forcible fire do the Smithes and Bearebrewers in all this part of the Low countries heat their furnaces than with the&s;e minerall coales of <HI>Liege;</HI> which are of &s;o &s;trange a nature, as water increa&s;eth their flame, but oile puts it out. The &s;mell of this fire or &s;moke, though it be &s;omewhat loath&s;ome to tho&s;e that are not accustomed with it, yet &s;alt being cast thereupon, it &s;melleth either but a little, or not at all.

<P>This region they &s;ay was conuerted to the faith by <HI>S.

<P>_THe Dukedome of <HI>Brabant</HI> is in &s;uch &s;ort circum&s;cribed by the riuers <HI>Mae&s;e, Scheld, Sambre,</HI> and <HI>Dender,</HI> as it no where ouerpa&s;&s;eth them; nor doth it in all places &s;tretch &s;o farre: for on this &s;ide the <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> lies a great part of the Prouince of <HI>Liege.</HI> But (that we may de&s;cribe the bounds hereof more perfectly) it hath to the North, <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Guelders;</HI> Ea&s;t, the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Liege;</HI> South, the counties of <HI>Namure</HI> and <HI>Henault;</HI> and We&s;t it is diuided From <HI>Flanders</HI> by the riuer <HI>Scheld.</HI> It is a goodly and plea&s;ant country, exceeding fertill, and abounding with come and fruits of all &s;orts, e&s;pecially to the South of the riuer of <HI>Demer.</HI> For the North part thereof, namely <HI>Kempenland,</HI> is &s;omewhat more barren and &s;andy. Howbeit, this part is not altogether fruitle&s;&s;e: for <HI>Iacobus Spie|legius</HI> writing to <HI>Guntherus</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> affirmeth that the husbandmen of <HI>Brabant</HI> are &s;o indu&s;trious, as they make the drie&s;t &s;andes to beare wheat. Al&s;o to head-cattell and &s;heepe, the greate&s;t part whereof (as we reade in <HI>Homer</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Libyan</HI> &s;heepe) are horned; it yeelds mo&s;t plea&s;ant and plentifull pa&s;ture. And now by the indu&s;try &amp; vnce&s;&s;ant labour of the husbandmen it is dayly &s;o manured; that where in times pa&s;t there was nothing but vnprofitable &s;and-heaps, you may at this pre&s;ent beholde, to the great benefit of the inhabitants, mo&s;t fruitfull corne-fields. On the Ea&s;t part of this Prouince there is a kinde of bogge or quagmite called <HI>Peele,</HI> the ground whereof (as <HI>Plinie</HI> reporteth of the fields <HI>Gabien&s;is</HI> and <HI>Reatinus</HI>) trembleth vnder a mans foot; neither can it be pa&s;&s;ed by hor&s;es or wagons, but only in Winter, when the vpper cru&s;t thereof is hardened with fro&s;t.</P>
<P>This region containes the Marque&s;at of the &s;acred Empire (the chiefe citie whereof is <HI>Antwerpe</HI>) as likewi&s;e the Marque|&s;at of <HI>Bergis,</HI> the Dukedome of <HI>Ar&s;chot,</HI> the Earledomes of <HI>Hoch&s;traten, Megen,</HI> and that of <HI>Cantecroy</HI> lately erected by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, &amp;c. It hath al&s;o woods and fore&s;ts, abounding with wilde bea&s;ts of &s;undry kindes: the principall whereof are <HI>Grootenhout, Grootenheyst, Meerdael, Zauenterloo</HI> and <HI>Soenien</HI> the greate&s;t of all, conteining in it for the &s;pace of &s;euen miles compa&s;&s;e &s;undry villages &amp; mona&s;teries. Hunting and hawking (except in the&s;e fiue woods, which are re&s;erued for the Princes owne game) are free for all men. The people are &s;o iocund, as they &s;eeme &s;car&s;e to feele the inconueniences of olde age; which frolike di&s;po&s;ition of theirs hath giuen occa&s;ion to their neighbours round about to v&s;e this ie&s;t: <HI>The longer the Brabanter liues, the more foole he.</HI> The aire is exceeding hol&s;ome: for when the plague hath beene mo&s;t vehement in all the regions adiacent, <HI>Brabant</HI> hath often mo&s;t wonderfully remained free.</P>
<P>This Dukedome of <HI>Brabant</HI> hath &s;ix and twentie cities enuironed with walles and ditches. And they are the&s;e following: ANTVVERPE &s;ituate vpon <HI>Scheld,</HI> the mo&s;t famous mart not only of <HI>Germanie,</HI> but of all <HI>Europe;</HI> and one of the &s;tronge&s;t cities in the world; being much beautified with the &s;teeple of <HI>S. Maries</HI> built an incredible height of white marble. The pa|lace lately built, is &s;car&s;e to be matched in all <HI>Europe.</HI> BRVSSEL, abounding with &s;weet fountaines. Here for the mo&s;t part re&s;ideth the Prince; and therefore is this towne &s;o much frequented by Nobles and Courtiers. LOVAIN, a large city, con|teining Gardens, Vineyards, and Pa&s;tures within the walles: well may you call it The habitation of the Mu&s;es; for which purpo&s;e in the yeere 1426. <HI>Iohn</HI> the fourth Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed here an Vniuer&s;itie, which flouri&s;heth with all kind of learning. The territorie of this citie makes <HI>Brabant</HI> to glory of her vintage. Then followes MACHELEN, famous for the court of Parliament there in&s;tituted by Duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Burgundie</HI> in the yeere 1473. HERTOGENBOSCH, a towne of no &s;mall importance, conteining an excellent Grammar &s;choole, and inhabited in times pa&s;t with a mo&s;t warlike people. TIE|NEN vpon the riuer <HI>Ghette,</HI> from whence are brought great &s;tore of chee&s;es. Here &s;tands the church of <HI>S. Germans,</HI> whereun|to belongs a college of Canons. LEVWE, where the noble ale is brewed. NIVELLE. In this citie there is a chanterie of Nunnes, whereinto none but ladies of great nobilitie can be admitted. The Gouerne&s;&s;e of this chantry the Nunnes them|&s;elues chu&s;e by voices, yet with the con&s;ent of the Prince, and the Bi&s;hops approbation; and &s;he is called the ladie of <HI>Niuella.</HI> Al&s;o the temporall and eccle&s;ia&s;ticall iuri&s;diction of the towne and adioyning territory &s;oly belongeth vnto her. ARSCHOT, &s;ituate on the riuer <HI>Demer,</HI> bearing at fir&s;t the title of a Marque&s;at, but &s;ince by <HI>Charles</HI> the fift aduanced to a Dukedome. BERGEN <HI>ap Zoom,</HI> &s;o named of a &s;mall riuer that runnes thorow it; a towne heeretofore of good traffique, but now by the neighbourhood of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> not &s;o frequented of forren merchants. MEGHEN, &s;ituate vpon the <HI>Mae&s;e.</HI> BREDA, a towne mo&s;t fairely built. Here &s;tands the Palace of the Earles of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> &s;o gallantly begun by a mo&s;t skilfull architect, that being once fini&s;hed, it may (I thinke) be preferred before all the Princes hou&s;es in this region. MAESTRIGHT, a large, populous, and rich citie; which though it &s;eemeth to lie without the bounds of <HI>Brabant,</HI> acknowledgeth the Duke of <HI>Brabant</HI> as her &s;ouereigne Lord. STEENBERGEN vpon the &s;ea-&s;hore. In times pa&s;t it was a flouri&s;hing mart towne; but now it is almo&s;t brought to nothing. LIERE, &s;o beautifull and plea&s;ant a towne, as many noble men make choi&s;e thereof as a place of recreat and &s;olace. VILVORDEN. Here is a &s;trong fortre&s;&s;e, and the ca&s;tle of the Duke. GEMBLOVRS. The Abbat of this towne beareth the greate&s;t &s;way in cau&s;es both eccle&s;ia&s;ticall and temporall. IOVDOIGNE for the hole&s;omne&s;&s;e of the aire in times pa&s;t the nur&s;erie of the yong Princes of this region. HANVT, heretofore reported to haue beene an Earledome, &s;ituate in a mo&s;t fertile place. LANDEN, e&s;teemed of &s;ome the mo&s;t ancient towne in all <HI>Brabant.</HI> HALEN, almo&s;t vtterly ruinated by warres.

<P>_THe region of <HI>Namur</HI> is at this pre&s;ent endowed with the title of an Earledome. Whether it was thus named of the principall citie, or that the city a&s;&s;umed this name from the region, remai|neth as yet vncertaine; as likewi&s;e the originall of the word it &s;elfe. The inhabitants call it <HI>Namur,</HI> and the high Dutch <HI>Namen,</HI> but the true &s;ignification of the word they are vtterly ignorant of. For tho&s;e that affirme that an Idol called <HI>Nanus,</HI> was of old wor&s;hipped, and deliuered an&s;wers and oracles vpon the &s;ame hill whereon now the ca&s;tle of <HI>Na|mure</HI> is &s;ituate, and that afterward, when Chri&s;tian religion began to &s;hine, this Idol waxing mute or &s;ilent, the whole region of <HI>Namure</HI> was &s;o named of <HI>Na|nus mutus;</HI> do (I thinke) report fables, without the authority of any approoued writers. <HI>Meierus</HI> affirmeth, that anciently it was called <HI>Neumur,</HI> as much to &s;ay in Latine as <HI>Nouus murus,</HI> a new wall.</P>
<P>Vpon this region do border the prouinces of <HI>Liege, Brabant, Henault,</HI> and <HI>Lut|zenburg.</HI> It is watered by <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Sambre,</HI> two nauigable riuers. The country is neither mountainous nor plaine; but rai&s;ed here &amp; there into little hilles, and depre&s;&s;ed into valleys: the woods, whereof the greate&s;t is called <HI>Marlaigne,</HI> yeeld plenty of game for Gentlemen. It abounds with things nece&s;&s;ary for mans life. Here are many yron-mines. Here al&s;o they digge a kinde of &s;tony or minerall coles, which in Dutch we call <HI>Steenkolen:</HI> the inhabitants, as likewi&s;e the Ligeois (for they are found with them al&s;o) terme them <HI>Hoille;</HI> the learned call them <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, as much to &s;ay as <HI>Stone-coles.</HI> The nature of the&s;e &s;tones is mo&s;t wonder|full: for whereas oyle increa&s;eth the flame of all other fewell, the&s;e burne more vehemently by ca&s;ting on water, and are quenched with oyle. With the&s;e coles the inhabitants and bordering nations (for they are tran&s;ported hence into other countries) do make lu&s;ty fires: and Black-&s;mithes do &s;often their yron bet|ter with this, than with any other fiering. Here are quarries al&s;o, out of which are cut marbles of exceeding hardne&s;&s;e, both blacke, browne, and particoloured; wherewith the churches &amp; hou&s;es of the regions adiacent are maruellou&s;ly ador|ned. By meanes of which marbles the people of <HI>Namure</HI> reape no &s;mall benefit.</P>
<P>This county hath foure walled townes: <HI>Namure, Bouuignes, Charlemont,</HI> and <HI>&V;allencure.</HI> NAMVRE, as hath beene &s;aid, is the principall city, and of late is be|come the &s;ee of a Bi&s;hop: it is right commodiou&s;ly &s;ituate, namely at the conflu|ence or meeting of the riuers <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Sambre:</HI> it hath bridges to pa&s;&s;e ouer both riuers. Here is the chiefe tribunall of iu&s;tice for the whole region. BOVVIG|NES &s;tands vpon the We&s;terne banke of <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> a towne in times pa&s;t glorious for building, and populous for inhabitants; but now &s;o deformed and ruined with often warres, as it hath lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of her beauty. CHARLEMONT is a mo&s;t impregnable ca&s;tle, &s;o named and built by <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, neere the banke of <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> on the top of an hill, by a village called <HI>Giuet.</HI> Neither is VALEN|CVRE a towne of &s;mall moment. Al&s;o within this county, be&s;ides diuers Ab|bies, there are 82. villages, of which <HI>Floreu, &V;a&s;cie, Sam&s;on,</HI> and &s;ome others, are &s;o large and beautifull, as they may well be compared with townes. This region of old bare the title of a Marque&s;ate: but about the yere 1200. it was conuerted into an Earledome. The people are very warlike, and mo&s;t loyall to their Prince. They &s;peake French. This region (as the re&s;t of the Lowe countries) is exactly de&s;cribed by <HI>Guicciardine.</HI></P>

Another deriuation al&s;o of the name of this countrey is produced by <HI>Carolus Bouillus</HI> in his di&s;cour&s;e of the variety of vulgar languages.</P>
<P>To the We&s;t of this Prouince by <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Artois;</HI> on the North <HI>Brabant;</HI> and <HI>Brabant</HI> againe with part of <HI>Namure</HI> and <HI>Liege</HI> vpon the Ea&s;t; and South it is bounded by <HI>Champaigne</HI> a Prouince of <HI>France.</HI> A country as plea&s;ant, and as well &s;tored with woods, lakes, fountaines, medowes, and pa&s;tures, as any other in all the&s;e parts.

Their liber|tie or freedome they v&s;ually boa&s;t of in a common prouerbe, &s;aying: <HI>Pays de Hainault tenu de Dieu &amp; du &s;oleil,</HI> that is, <HI>The Prouince of Henault holds of God and of the &s;unne.</HI> Which prouerbe <HI>Nicolaus Brontius</HI> in a di&s;cour&s;e of his publi&s;hed in commendation of this region, interpreteth in two Latine ver&s;es to this effect:
<Q><L>Star-guiding Ioue and Phoebus bright,</L>
<L>Of this place only challenge right.</L></Q> In length it conteineth about twenty, and in bredth &s;ixteene miles. In which &s;pace (as <HI>Guicciardin</HI> reporteth) it comprehends foure and twenty townes, and aboue nine hundred and fiftie villages or hamlets. <HI>Robert Caenalis</HI> reckons vp in this Prouince two thou&s;and two hundred petie villages with Churches and &s;teeples. At this pre&s;ent it beareth the title of an Earledome: and it containes within it one Princedome, eight inferi|our Earledomes, twelue Peeres, two and twentie Baronies, &s;ix and twentie Abbeys, with other titles of dig|nitie, which are to be &s;eene in <HI>Guicciardine.</HI></P>
<P>The principall cities are <HI>Mons</HI> and <HI>Valenchienes:</HI> the la&s;t whereof &s;ituate vpon the riuer <HI>Scheld,</HI> where it be|gins to be nauigable for boats and barks, is a towne very large and &s;trongly walled. The towne&s;men for the mo&s;t part imploy them&s;elues in trade of merchandi&s;e; and reape exceeding gaines by a kinde of cloth which they call <HI>Fu&s;&s;ets,</HI> great quantitie whereof is wouen in this citie, and carried from hence to the furthe&s;t parts of the world. <HI>Mons</HI> &s;tandeth vpon the little riuer <HI>Trouille,</HI> almo&s;t in the very mid&s;t of all the region. A towne very &s;ufficiently fortified again&s;t all ho&s;tile attempts. The citizens enrich them&s;elues by a kinde of &s;tuffe commonly called Saye, whereof great abundance is here made. Here are be&s;ides the townes of <HI>Condet, Halle, Angie, Maubeuge, Aue&s;ne, Beaumont, Chimay, Quercey,</HI> the retiring place of <HI>Mary,</HI> &s;i&s;ter to Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, who built there a mo&s;t &s;tately and &s;umptuous Palace, which was then highly e&s;teemed; but afterward by the French King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd quite burned and defaced. Here al&s;o is <HI>Bauacum</HI> commonly called <HI>Bauais,</HI> which &s;ome thinke to be <HI>Baganum</HI> or <HI>Bagacum</HI> mentioned by <HI>Ptolemey.</HI> Others are of opinion, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his commentaries calles it <HI>Belgium.</HI> Howbeit <HI>Hubert</HI> of <HI>Liege</HI> thinks it not to haue been &s;o migh|tie in <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> time, but rather mo&s;t of all to haue flouri&s;hed vnder <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Emperour: which he ga|thereth by the ancient coines here dayly digged vp in great quantitie, with the &s;aid Emperours image vp|on them. In the market-place of this towne &s;tands a pillar of &s;tone, at the foot whereof the inhabitants &s;ay that all tho&s;e wayes begin, which with an high and direct pa&s;&s;age extend from hence to all parts of <HI>France.</HI> The&s;e wayes (they &s;ay) were made by <HI>Brunchild.</HI> And euen till this day they are called after his name.

Al&s;o vpon the frontiers of this region towards the riuer <HI>Mae&s;e,</HI> in the way to <HI>France,</HI> you haue <HI>Charlemont, Marieburg,</HI> and <HI>Philippeuille,</HI> mo&s;t &s;trong garri&s;ons again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the French: being built and &s;o named by Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, by <HI>Mary</HI> his &s;i&s;ter, and by K. <HI>Philip</HI> his &s;onne.</P>
<P>This region aboundeth with iron and lead-mines.

Likewi&s;e here is digged great plentie of lime. Al&s;o a kinde of &s;tony and blacke coales, hardened in the nature of pitch, which the inhabitants v&s;e for fewell in &s;tead of wood.

<P>_THat the Atrebates were not the meane&s;t people of <HI>Gallia Belgica, Cae&s;ar</HI> him&s;elfe is witne&s;&s;e. They are and haue beene a warlike nation, retaining as yet their ancient name. The head citie called in Latine <HI>Atrebatum,</HI> was of olde the Metropolitan al&s;o of <HI>Flanders;</HI> now it is named in French <HI>Arras,</HI> whereof the region adiacent and all the whole Prouince is called <HI>Artois,</HI> as if you would &s;ay <HI>Arratois,</HI> ca&s;ting away the middle &s;yllable. Hereupon by a new Latine name they call it <HI>Arte&s;ia.</HI> The whole region was by <HI>S. Lewis</HI> the French King adorned with the title of an Earledome: and the fir&s;t Earle thereof was <HI>Robert</HI> the &s;ame Kings brother, as writeth <HI>Vignier.</HI> It is very large, extending from the frontiers of <HI>Cambre&s;is, Picardie, Henault,</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> euen to the Ocean &s;ea. It was in times pa&s;t &s;ubiect to the Crowne of <HI>France;</HI> but now by meanes of the peace betweene Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, and <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t the French King, concluded 1529, it is an ab&s;olute &s;tate of it &s;elfe. It hath two fa|mous cities, namely, <HI>Arras</HI> and <HI>S. Omer:</HI> the principall townes be <HI>Ayre, He&s;din, Lens, Bethune, Bappames, S. Paul, Lillers,</HI> and <HI>Perne;</HI> all which places are &s;ubiect to the King Catholike. The cities of <HI>Boulogne, Calais, Gui&s;nes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres</HI> (which are al&s;o within the bounds of this Countie) are the French Kings: for <HI>Pontieu</HI> is now aboli&s;hed. It hath al&s;o diuers fortre&s;&s;es and &s;trong holds, be&s;ides an incredible number of noblemens ca&s;tles, which they v&s;e for dwelling hou&s;es. It contained of olde two famous bi&s;hopricks, namely <HI>Arras</HI> and <HI>Ponthieu:</HI> but &s;ince, <HI>Ponthieu</HI> in the yere 1553. was vtterly de&s;troyed, the iuri&s;diction thereof was di&s;tributed to three Epi&s;copall &s;eas; namely, <HI>S. Omer,</HI> and <HI>Ypre</HI> for the one halfe, and <HI>Boulogne</HI> for the re&s;idue. Bailiwicks or Hundreds, being the principall members or parts of the whole Countie, it hath nine; namely, that of <HI>Arras,</HI> of <HI>S. Omer,</HI> of <HI>Ponthieu,</HI> of <HI>Ayre, He&s;din, Lens, Bappames, Auen, Bredenard,</HI> and <HI>Aubignie.</HI> Vnder the Baili|wicke of <HI>Arras</HI> are comprized <HI>Boulogne, S. Paul, Perne, Bethune,</HI> and <HI>Lilers;</HI> but <HI>Calais, Gui&s;nes,</HI> and <HI>Ardres</HI> doe by ancient right belong to <HI>S. Omer.</HI> Likewi&s;e the Earle of <HI>Artois</HI> had other inferiour Earles to his va&s;&s;als, as namely, the Earle of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> of <HI>S. Paul,</HI> of <HI>Arcques,</HI> of <HI>Blangie,</HI> of <HI>Faukenberge,</HI> and of <HI>Syneghen.</HI> Now al&s;o it is augmented with the Princedome of <HI>E&s;pinee,</HI> and the Marque&s;ate of <HI>Renty.</HI> But how <HI>Boulogne</HI> fir&s;t exempted it &s;elfe from the iuri&s;diction of <HI>Artois,</HI> it is manife&s;t out of hi&s;tories: for after a certaine Earle of <HI>Boulogne</HI> was attainted of trea&s;on again&s;t the French King, the King vpon that occa&s;ion &s;eizing vpon his Earldom, it euer &s;ince denied homage vnto <HI>Artois.</HI> Wherefore the Earle of <HI>Artois</HI> lo&s;ing the one halfe of his right, a&s;&s;umed directly to him&s;elfe homage or fealty ouer the county of <HI>S. Paul</HI> (which before was feudatarie to the Earle of <HI>Boulogne</HI>) &s;aying often times, that he would not be depriued both of his homage and vnder-homage: &s;o that hitherto the Princes on both &s;ides haue v&s;ed this cu&s;tom; namely, that <HI>Boulogne</HI> no more acknowledgeth <HI>Ar|tois,</HI> nor <HI>S. Paul Boulogne.</HI> Howbeit about this point in the latter treaty of peace 1559. there was &s;ome variance; wherefore the matter being referred to Commi&s;sioners, remaines as yet vndecided, the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hol|ding &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;sion. It is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Calais</HI> (the next port of the continent vnto <HI>England</HI>) was by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> called <HI>Portus Iccius,</HI> from whence he &s;ailed out of <HI>France</HI> thither. But if we more thorowly con&s;ider the matter, we &s;hall finde it to haue beene another Port, namely, the towne of <HI>Saint Omer,</HI> which that it was of old an hauen and a mo&s;t large inlet of the Ocean &s;ea, euen the high cliffes, which in a maner enuironing the citie, do plainly demon&s;trate, be&s;ides infinit other arguments and reliques of antiquitie, which (though no man &s;hould affirme it) do mo&s;t euidently conuince, that the territorie adiacent was in times pa&s;t coue|red with &s;ea; the trueth whereof is till this day al&s;o confirmed by common and con&s;tant report. Yea <HI>Sithieu</HI> the ancient name of the citie (for who knowes not that the name of <HI>S. Omer</HI> is but new) manife&s;teth the &s;ame. As if it were deriued of <HI>Sinus Itthius</HI> or <HI>Iccius.</HI> Al&s;o that the &s;aid haue was in the prouince of the <HI>Morini,</HI> which <HI>Virgil</HI> and <HI>Lucan</HI> doe call the farthe&s;t people. And that this is mo&s;t true, an attentiue Reader may by many arguments ea&s;ily gather both out of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> his entrance and returne from <HI>England.</HI> Neither can the &s;pace of thirtie miles or thereabout, which he &s;ayth the i&s;land is there di&s;tant from the maine, hinder my beliefe in this point; whenas the violence of the &s;ea (e&s;pecially in &s;o narrow a place) may ea&s;ily either adde or dimini&s;h. Nor doth the di&s;tance of the &s;ea there from the maine to the continent much differ. Sufficeth thus much to haue beene &s;aid concerning <HI>Portus Iccius.</HI> Whether we haue hit the trueth or no, let others iudge. Moreouer, this Prouince hath three Bi&s;hopricks, to wit, <HI>Arras, S. Omer,</HI> and <HI>Boulogne;</HI> one and twen|tie Abbeys, and &s;euen Nunries; be&s;ides many Couents and Ho&s;pitals. It hath many riuers al&s;o; the prin|cipall whereof are <HI>Lys, Scarpe, Aa, Canche,</HI> and <HI>Authy,</HI> be&s;ides others that are nauigable.</P>
<P>Great is the number of villages and hamlets thorowout the whole prouince. The &s;oile is mo&s;t fertile and abundant of all corne, and e&s;pecially of wheat. Wherefore in the ancient French tongue &s;ome write it was called <HI>Atrech,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>The land of bread.</HI> Nor is it de&s;titute of woods and groues, e&s;pecially towards the South and We&s;t. The garments of the Atrebates or Arte&s;ians <HI>S. Ierome</HI> in his &s;econd booke again&s;t <HI>Io|uinian</HI> noteth for precious. Al&s;o the Arte&s;ian mantles <HI>Vopi&s;cus</HI> celebrateth in the life of the Emperour <HI>Cari|nus.</HI> Likewi&s;e the &s;ame <HI>Ierome</HI> and other authours affirme, that in his time it rained wooll in this prouince.

It abounds with butter and chee&s;e; and yeeldeth wheat in abundance. The inhabitants are most of them merchants: and of flax (wherof they haue in <HI>Flanders</HI> great plenty, &amp; excellent good) and wooll (which is brought them out of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>England</HI>) they make great quantity of linnen and woollen cloth, which they di&s;per&s;e farre and wide. This Prouince of <HI>Flanders</HI> hath <HI>28.</HI> walled cities, <HI>1154</HI> villages, be&s;ides fortre&s;&s;es, castles, and noble mens hou&s;es. Among which <HI>Gaunt</HI> is the greatest citie. Whereof <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> of <HI>Roterdam</HI> in his Epistles writeth in maner following: I am of opinion (&s;aith he) if you looke all Christendome ouer, you &s;hall not finde a citie comparable to this, either for largene&s;&s;e and &s;trength, or for the ciuill gouernment and towardline&s;&s;e of the people. So far <HI>Era&s;mus.</HI> It containeth in compa&s;&s;e three Dutch miles. It is watered by three riuers, which diuide it into twenty inhabited i&s;les. For multitude and beauty of hou&s;es <HI>Bruges</HI> excelleth almost all the cities of the Netherlands; &s;o famous a mart in times past, as (&s;aith <HI>Iacobus Marchantius</HI>) by that meanes the name of <HI>Flanders</HI> ob&s;cured all the regions round about. <HI>Yperen</HI> &s;tands vpon the riuer of <HI>Yperlee,</HI> very commodious for Fullers. By clothing it grew in times pa&s;t to an huge big|ne&s;&s;e, till the Engli&s;h and men of <HI>Gaunt</HI> be&s;ieging it, ca&s;t downe the large &s;uburbs, and greatly dimi|ni&s;hed the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As it is &s;ayd in a common prouerbe, that <HI>Millan</HI> for a Dukedome excelles all Christendome; &s;o doth <HI>Flanders</HI> for an Earledome. It hath certaine prerogatiues: for the Prince thereof writes him|&s;elfe Earle of <HI>Flanders</HI> by the grace of God: which clau&s;e is proper to the &s;tile of Kings. For it is giuen <HI>(&s;aith Meierus)</HI> to no Duke, Marques, or Earle in Chri&s;tendome, but only to him of <HI>Flan|ders:</HI> whenas all others v&s;ually adde, <HI>By the clemency,</HI> or <HI>By the a&s;si&s;tance of God,</HI> &amp;c. He had in times pa&s;t &s;undry officers peculiar to a King; as namely his Chancellour, his Ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, his Chamberlain, and his Cupbearer; al&s;o two Mar&s;hals and ten Peeres, as in <HI>France.</HI> The armes of this region in times past were a &s;cutcheon Azure, diuided by fiue Cro&s;&s;e-barres of golde with another &s;mall red &s;cutcheon in the midst. Now it is a blacke lion in a golden field; which &s;ome are of opinion, he tooke for his armes, together with the other Netherlandi&s;h Princes, when they &s;et forth on their expedition towards <HI>Syria</HI> in the company of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>El&s;as:</HI> for at that time the princes of <HI>Flanders, Louaine, Holland, Lutzenburg, Limburg, Brabant, Zeland, Fri&s;|land, Henault,</HI> &amp;c. changing their ancient armes, a&s;&s;umed to them&s;elues lions of diuers colours.</P>
<P>The greater part of <HI>Flanders</HI> was from the beginning vnder protection of the French Kings; but now it is at libertie, and ab&s;olute of it &s;elfe; being relea&s;ed by Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fift, Earle of <HI>Flanders:</HI> who in the treatie of <HI>Madrid</HI> quite &s;hooke off the French yoke. This region <HI>Guic|ciardine</HI> hath most diligently de&s;cribed, and <HI>Iacobus Marchantius</HI> mo&s;t learnedly.

<P><HI>_LEuinus Lemnius</HI> of <HI>Zirichzee,</HI> in his booke <HI>De occultis naturae miraculis,</HI> Of the bidden &s;ecrets of Nature, among&s;t other things writeth thus of <HI>Zeland,</HI> his natiue country: That this Marine tract, &s;aith he, was notvnknowne vnto the ancients, it may out of <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> ea&s;ily be gathered; although not by the &s;ame name, that at this day it is knowne by: but of a cu&s;tome and common kind of &s;alutation and &s;peaking one to another, which acquaintance and friends of this prouince do v&s;e at their meetings: therefore he calleth them by the name of <HI>MATTIACI,</HI> when he thus writeth: <HI>In the &s;ame iuri&s;diction are the</HI> Mattiaci, <HI>a nation very like the</HI> Bataui, <HI>but that tho&s;e, in re|gard of the &s;ituation of their countrie, are more de&s;perate and couragious.</HI> Whereby he giueth to vnder&s;tand, that although they are next neighbours and do border vpon the <HI>Bataui</HI> or Hollan|ders, (&s;o called of the hollowne&s;&s;e and lowne&s;&s;e of the ground) &s;o that they might iu&s;tly be ac|counted one and the &s;ame people, yet are only di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of their cu&s;tomary &s;aluation; and being neerer the Sea, are more hardie and audacious; (as indeed they are,) and for manhood, witte, policy, craft, deceits, cunning in buying and &s;elling, and diligence in getting, and waies to enrich them&s;elues, they do farre excell them. And in that hee calleth them <HI>Mattiaci,</HI> I conceiue it, that they were not &s;o named either of any place or captaine, but of that fellowlike &s;alutation, as I &s;aid, and v&s;uall maner of &s;peaking one to another v&s;uall among&s;t them, to witte, of <HI>Maet,</HI> which in common &s;peach and friendly meetings, &s;ignifieth a fellow and companion in all our actions, bargaines, contracts, and dangers; of all our purpo&s;es, coun|&s;ailes, labours and trauailles: a copartner and con&s;ort in any thing what&s;oeuer we take in hand or go about, &amp;c. For the name of <HI>Zeland</HI> is not ancient, but is lately inuented, and made of Sea and Land, as who would &s;ay <HI>Sea-land,</HI> a country or land bordering vpon the &s;ea: for it is enclo&s;ed round with the ocean, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteene Ilands, although it be not long &s;ince the raging Sea did great hurt in this country, by who&s;e violence and ouerflowing, a good part of <HI>Zeland,</HI> (his dammes, walles and banks being rent and broken downe,) was ouercome of the &s;alt-water and laid leuell with the &s;ea: notwith&s;tan|ding certaine of them do remaine, of which e&s;pecially three do continually wre&s;tle with the boi&s;terous billowes of the &s;ea, and do very hardly defend them&s;elues with infinite co&s;ts and charges again&s;t this rude and vnruly element. Of the&s;e fir&s;t <HI>Wal|cheren (Walachria)</HI> doth offer it &s;elfe to the eie of &s;uch as do &s;aile to the&s;e coa&s;ts; &s;o named either of him that fir&s;t entered and inhabited in it, or (as I ge&s;&s;e) of the Gaulls <HI>(Galli)</HI> which much frequented this country; who of the Low-countrie-men are yet called <HI>Walen;</HI> or of that part of <HI>Brittaine</HI> which lieth vpon the We&s;t &s;ide of it, and is called <HI>Wales,</HI> the mo&s;t gentleman|like and braue&s;t nation (you may beleeue him,) among&s;t the Engli&s;h, and de&s;cended al&s;o from the Gaulles, which their lan|guage as yet doth manife&s;t &amp;c. From hence Northward or &s;omewhat declining toward the Ea&s;t is <HI>Scouwen <HI>Scaldia,</HI></HI> the Latines call it of the riuer <HI>Sceldt,</HI> which runneth by it and heere falleth into the &s;ea &amp;c. <HI>Suytheuelandt,</HI> &s;o named of the &s;itua|tion of it toward the South (to di&s;tingui&s;h it from another di&s;tant from it Northward and therefore called <HI>Noortheuelandt</HI>) a large and mo&s;t goodly tract of ground, coa&s;ting along the &s;hore of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> although of late yeares hauing &s;uf|fered great dammage and lo&s;&s;e, it is now much le&s;&s;e and narrower. Thus farre <HI>Lemnius. Tritthemius</HI> in the Annalles of the Franks nameth <HI>Middleborough</HI> the chiefe city of the&s;e Ilands <HI>Me&s;oburgus Meyer;</HI> calleth it <HI>Mattiacum,</HI> more like a Latini&s;t, then a true Geographer. More of the&s;e thou mai&s;t read in the forenamed <HI>Lemnius,</HI> who hath mo&s;t excellently well de&s;cribed all the Ilands of <HI>Zeland,</HI> and the cities of the &s;ame. To the&s;e if thou wilt, thou mai&s;t adioine <HI>Lewis Guicciardine,</HI> and I know not what els thou can&s;t &s;eeke for further &s;atisfaction. There are al&s;o certaine Annalles of the&s;e Ilands, written in the mother tongue by <HI>Iohn Reygersberg.</HI> But for an incomme, thou mai&s;t al&s;o to the&s;e former adde the de&s;criptions of the cities of the Low-countries, done by <HI>Adrian Barland.</HI> Of the people of this prouince the&s;e ver&s;es are commonly &s;poken:

<L>The wor&s;e they wax, as they grow old;</L>
<L>In Zelanders this rule doth hold.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e Ilands are &s;ituate between the mouthes of the riuers <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Sceldt,</HI> bordering on the North vpon <HI>Holland,</HI> on the Ea&s;t vpon <HI>Brabant,</HI> on the South vpon <HI>Flanders;</HI> on the We&s;t vpon the Germane &s;ea. <HI>Iames Meyer</HI> thinketh that <HI>Proco|pius</HI> calleth the&s;e <HI>Arboricas.</HI> Yet <HI>Petrus Diuaeus</HI> is of opinion that this place of <HI>Procopius</HI> is corrupt, and for <HI>Arborichas</HI> it ought to be read and written, <HI>Abroditos.</HI></P>
<P>That the&s;e are tho&s;e Ilands, I do verily beleeue, vnto which <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> in his &s;ixth booke <HI>De bello Gallico,</HI> affirmeth that he for|ced a part of the army of <HI>Ambiorix</HI> Prince of the <HI>Eburones:</HI> which, as his owne words do giue to vnder&s;tand, did hide them|&s;elues in Ilands, which the continuall motion, or ebbing and flowing of the &s;ea had made. It is al&s;o very probable that <HI>Lu|cane</HI> in his fir&s;t booke aimed at the&s;e I&s;les, in the&s;e his ver&s;es: <HI>Qua&abque; iacet littus dubium, quod terra fretum&abque; Vendicat alter|nis vicibus, c&ugrave;m funditus ingens Oceanus, vel c&ugrave;m refugis &s;e fluctibus aufert.

And that which the &s;ame Authour in his ninth booke &s;ometime did &s;peake of the <HI>Syrtes</HI> or Quick&s;ands, one may now not altogether vnfitly applie to the&s;e Ilands, where he thus &s;peaketh, &mdash; <HI>Primam mun|do Natura figuram Cum daret, in dubio terrae pelagi&abque; reliquit: Nam ne&abque; &s;ub&s;edit penitus quo &s;tagna profundi Acciperet, nec&s;e defendit ab aequore tellus: Ambigua &s;ed lege loci iacet inuia &s;edes.</HI> When as this ma&s;&s;ie world by Nature fir&s;t was fram'd, A doubtfull ca&s;e it &s;eem'd how God would haue it nam'd: For neither could the earth receiue the ocean deep, Nor land well able was his owne from &s;ea to keep: The place &s;o dangerous is, that none to it dare go; And whether &s;ea or land it be, men skarce do know. Yet now the&s;e our Ilands are habitable, and ea&s;ie and &s;afely to be come vnto, by the indu&s;trie and labour of man, and not by the benefit and nature of the place.</P>

<HEAD>HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_THus <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> of <HI>Roterodam,</HI> an Hollander doth de&s;cribe <HI>Holland,</HI> his natiue country: Mo&s;t learned men, &s;aith he, do agree in this, and that vpon great probabil ty, that that iland of the Rhein vpon the maine &s;ea, which <HI>Tacitus</HI> maketh mention of in his 20. booke, is the &s;ame that now they call HOLLAND. A land that I mu&s;t alwaies both highly commend &amp; reue|rence, as to whom indeed I owe my life and natiuitie: And I would to God that it lay in my power to do it againe as great credit, as it hath done me honour and good, for the which I am much bound to prai&s;e the Lord. For in that that Martiall doth accu&s;e this nation <HI>ru&s;ticitatis,</HI> of clowni&s;h &s;implicity; and that in that <HI>Lucane</HI> calleth the &s;ame <HI>trucem,</HI> rough and vnciuill, either it is nothing to vs, or els I deeme both to be interpreted as a great commendation vnto the &s;ame. For what nation in former times hath not been &s;omewhat rude and vnciuill? or when were the Romanes more to be com|mended, then when they knew no other art or my&s;terie but husbandrie and di&s;cipline of warre? If &s;o be that tho&s;e things which then were &s;aid of the Hollanders, &s;ome man &s;hall &s;tand in they may be verified of them now; what greater prai&s;e can be attributed to <HI>Holland,</HI> my natiue country, then if it may truly be &s;aid to loath tho&s;e ie&s;ts of <HI>Martiall,</HI> which he him&s;elfe calleth <HI>nequitias,</HI> knaueries? And I would to God that all Chri&s;tians had &s;uch eares, as the&s;e Hollanders had, that they might either not enter|taine tho&s;e pe&s;tilent conceits of that Poet, or at the lea&s;twi&s;e would not be delighted with them. If any man plea&s;e to call this clowni&s;hne&s;&s;e, we do wil|lingly beare that &s;landerous reproch, as being a thing common to vs with the good Lacedemonians, with the old Sabines &amp; the worthy Catoes, &s;o much commended. And <HI>Lucane,</HI> as I thinke, called the Hollanders <HI>truces,</HI> rough, in no other &s;en&s;e then <HI>Virgill</HI> calleth the Romane <HI>acer,</HI> &s;tout and hardie. Other|wi&s;e if any man do re&s;pect their homely and plaine maners, there is no nation more prone to ciuility and curteous humanity, in which there is le&s;&s;e cruel|ty or &s;urly &s;ternne&s;&s;e; they are of a good nature, plaine, void of all trechery and guile, inclined to no notorious vices: only they are a little too much giuen to their plea&s;ure, e&s;pecially in banquetting: the rea&s;on of which I iudge to be the wonderfull plenty of all maner of things prouoking them thereunto: and that partly by rea&s;on of the forrein commodities brought vnto them, for that not only it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the two mouths of the goodly riuers <HI>Mae&s;e</HI> and <HI>Rhein,</HI> but al&s;o for that the greate&s;t part of this We&s;t coa&s;t is continually wa&s;hed with the maine &s;ea: partly by rea&s;on of the naturall fertility of the countrie, which euery where is watered with many great and nauigable riuers well &s;tored with fi&s;h, and &s;o hath abundance of pa&s;torage and mo&s;t fatte meadowes. Moreouer the fennes and woods affoord infinite &s;tore of wild-foule: and therefore they con&s;tantly affirme that there is no country in the world, which in &s;o little compa&s;&s;e and plot of ground conteineth more cities and townes, not very big in quantity and circuite, but for &s;tate of common|wealth and gouernment excellent. For cleanline&s;&s;e and near keeping of their hou&s;es, the Hollanders do beare away the bell from all other nations what&s;oeuer, by the iudgement of Merchants which haue trauelled ouer the greate&s;t part of the world. Of meane learned men there is no where greater plenty. The rea&s;on why many of them come not to the height of that exqui&s;ite learning, e&s;pecially of the ancients, is their wanton and riotous life, or for that they e&s;teeme more of hone&s;ty and vertue, then great learning: For it cannot be denied but that they haue good wits, as is manife&s;t by many argu|ments: although indeed it doth not appeare by me, who&s;e gift that way is not great, as in nothing els. Thus farre <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> in his <HI>Chiliades.</HI></P>
<P>This country of <HI>Holland</HI> almo&s;t wholly enclo&s;ed like a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> with the &s;ea, and the mouths of the riuers <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Rhein,</HI> is not very large, as being in compa&s;&s;e not more then 60. Dutch miles: yet it comprehendeth 29. walled cities, which are the&s;e, DORDRECHT, about an hundred yeares &s;ince by a deluge and ouerflowing of the &s;ea made an iland: by this 4. riuers do runne. It is a mightie city, inhabited of very wealthy citizens, and beautified with mo&s;t gallant buildings both publike and priuate. Heere is a great concour&s;e of Merchants: for in it is held the &s;taple of Rheni&s;h wine, corne, timber, and other wares and merchandice which are brought downe by the <HI>Maes</HI> and <HI>Rhein</HI> into the&s;e countries to be &s;old. HAERLEM; this is the mo&s;t &s;tately and greate&s;t citie of all <HI>Holland,</HI> &s;ituate in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant place. Hard without the town walls is a very fine groue, whither the citizens vpon fe&s;tiuall daies, do withdraw them&s;elues, for their plea&s;ure and recreation, after their labour and toile&s;ome bu&s;ines. This town is famous for clothing, where it is cer|taine that there are tenne or twelue thou&s;and clothes yearely made. Heere the citizens do per&s;wade them&s;elues the my&s;terie of printing was fir&s;t inuented and practi&s;ed. DELET, &s;o named of <HI>Delft,</HI> which in their language &s;ignifieth a ditch. Heere al&s;o the towne&s;men v&s;e clothing. Moreouer in this city, they brue good beere, which from hence in great plenty is tran&s;ported into <HI>Zeland.</HI> This towne in the yeare 1536. &s;uffered great lo&s;&s;e by fire, the greate&s;t part of it being vtterly defaced. LEIDEN, vpon the <HI>Rhein,</HI> not far from his mouth where it &s;ometime did fall into the &s;ea, which now you may perceiue to be &s;topped &amp; choaked with &s;and. It is thought to be the mo&s;t ancient city of this prouince: for &s;ome do thinke it to haue beene &s;o named of a Roman legion which &s;ometime wintered in this place. Certaine antiquities are heere yet to be &s;eene to this day. GOVDE vpon the riuer <HI>I&s;el,</HI> in that place where it meeteth with the riuer <HI>Goude</HI> or <HI>Gouwe,</HI> whereof the city tooke his name. It is very populous. AMSTELREDAM, mo&s;t &s;tately built vpon the inlet or bay called <HI>Tie,</HI> the mo&s;t populous and frequent Mart towne of all the&s;e parts. In euery &s;treet almo&s;t, like as in <HI>Venice,</HI> a man may pa&s;&s;e from place to place, by boate a&s;well as by foot, to di&s;patch his bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. Heere daily from <HI>Norway, ku&s;&s;ia,</HI> and other Northren countries, as al&s;o from <HI>Spaine, France, England,</HI> &amp;c. great &s;tore of &s;hippes do arriue and ancher; &s;o that &s;ometimes you &s;hall &s;ee at once two hundred or three hundred faile of Mer|chants &s;hippes (<HI>hulks</HI> they call them) to ride heereat anchor. Therefore this city for traffique, is commonly held to yeeld to none but <HI>Antwerp.</HI> EN|CKHVISEN, vpon that &s;ea, which they vulgarly call in their language <HI>Suyderzee.</HI> Famous euen in forren countries for the building of great &s;hippes. HOORN, &s;ituate al&s;o vpon the &s;ame bay. Heere in May is kept a faire, where there is &s;old &s;uch infinite &s;tore of butter and chee&s;e, as is wonderfull. ALKMAER; this place for plenty of butter and chee&s;e doth excell all other cities of this prouince. PVRMERENDE, famous for the ca&s;tle or palace of the Count <HI>Egmond.</HI> EDAM, for building of &s;hippes and good chee&s;e, de&s;erueth al&s;o to be remembred among&s;t the re&s;t. Moreouer MVNNEKENDAM, WEESP, NAERDEN, and WEERT may not be forgotten. OVDEVVATER, heere groweth great &s;tore of hemp, &s;o that heere they make almo&s;t all the nets, ropes and cables which the Hollanders and Zelanders do v&s;e in fi&s;hing. SCOONHOVEN; as who would &s;ay, At the faire Orchards. Here is continuall fi&s;hing for Salmons, where al&s;o is held a Staple of this commodity, as we &s;aid there was of wine at <HI>Dordrecht.</HI> Next after the&s;e do follow I|SELSTEIN, VIANEN: Item LEERDAM, ASPEREN, and HVEKELEN, three little cities round in a circle vpon the riuer <HI>Lingen,</HI> not about 500. pa&s;es one from another. GORICVM and WORICHVM, &s;ituate, vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Wael,</HI> one ouer again&s;t another. <HI>Gorichum</HI> hath a very goodly and beautifull ca&s;tle. A man may iu&s;tly call this town a city of &s;tore of all maner proui&s;ion: &s;uch a market is heere daily kept of &s;uch things as are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;u&s;tenance of mans life, which are from thence tran&s;ported by &s;hippe vnto other countries, but e&s;pecially to <HI>Antwerp:</HI> La&s;tly, there are HVESDEN, ROTERODAM, SCHIEDAM, and both the MOVNTS, the one known by the name of <HI>S. Gertrude,</HI> the other of the number of Se|uen; <HI>Seuenbergen</HI> I meane, and <HI>Geertruydenberge,</HI> for &s;o they call them. Other towns there are, which &s;ometime were walled: which although at this day we do now &s;ee them to want, either by the rage of violent warre, or by rea&s;on of other misfortunes, yet they &s;till enioy their old liberties and fredoms. Of this &s;ort <HI>Medenblick Beuerwijck, Muiden, Neuport, Vlaerdingen,</HI> and <HI>Graue&s;ande.</HI> Moreouer in this prouince there are aboue foure hundred villages, among&s;t the which the <HI>Haghe,</HI> (which they call <HI>Earls Haghe</HI>) doth farre excell the re&s;t.

Neere vnto is a darke or thicke grone, which by rea&s;on of the &s;inging of birds, and &s;ight of Deere, is both to the eares and eies mo&s;t plea&s;ant and delightfull.

<P>_THat the <HI>Frisij,</HI> a mo&s;t ancient nation, did long &s;ince inhabit along the &s;ea coa&s;t, neere the mouth of the riuer of <HI>Rhein,</HI> where al&s;o at this day they dwell, it is very apparant out of the records of ancient writers. For <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth them aboue the <HI>Bu&s;actores</HI> (or <HI>Bu&s;acteri,</HI> the people of that prouince which now is called <HI>We&s;tfalia,</HI> as &s;ome thinke) between the ri|uers <HI>Vidrus,</HI> (they call it <HI>Regge</HI>) and <HI>Ama&s;ius,</HI> now called <HI>Eems. Tacitus,</HI> who reporteth that they were of good account among&s;t the Germanes, and along by the &s;ea coa&s;t to dwell on ech &s;ide the <HI>Rhein:</HI> diuideth them according to their power and greatnes of command, into <HI>Maiores</HI> and <HI>Minores,</HI> the Greater and the Le&s;&s;er: hee moreouer affirmeth that they dwell round about certaine huge Lakes, &s;uch as were capable of the Roman fleet. The &s;ame authour nameth certaine <HI>Fri&s;ios Tran&s;rhenanos,</HI> Frie&s;landmen, dwelling beyond the <HI>Rhein:</HI> which he &s;aith did rather mi&s;like the auarice of the Romanes then their command. <HI>Iulius Capitolinus</HI> in the life of <HI>Clo|dius Albinus</HI> the Emperour, &s;aith, that the&s;e Tran&s;rhenane Frie&s;landers were by the &s;ame <HI>Clodius Albinus</HI> di&s;comfi|ted and ouerthrowne. <HI>Pliny</HI> mentioneth certaine Ilands of the Frie&s;landers <HI>(in&s;ulas Fri&s;iorum)</HI> in the riuer of <HI>Rhein:</HI> and the <HI>Eri&s;ciabones,</HI> a kind of people between <HI>Helium</HI> and <HI>Fleuum,</HI> two mouthes of the <HI>Rhein,</HI> where it emptieth it &s;elfe into the maine &s;ea.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t therefore that the <HI>Frisij,</HI> anciently did not pa&s;&s;e the riuer <HI>Eems:</HI> but at this day they are further &s;pred Ea&s;tward, almo&s;t as farre as the riuer <HI>We&s;er,</HI> (the old Geographers called it <HI>Vi&s;urgis.</HI>) Who al&s;o otherwi&s;e of them &s;ometime, were de&s;igned by the name of the <HI>Chauci;</HI> (or <HI>Cauchi,</HI> for diuers authours write it diuer&s;ly) it is out of all doubt. And be&s;ide the&s;e vp higher, euen in <HI>Denmarke,</HI> in the confines of the little prouince <HI>Dietmar&s;h,</HI> there dwell a people vulgarly knowne by the name of <HI>Strandt Vrie&s;en,</HI> that is, Frie&s;landmen inhabiting vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t. The&s;e it may be were tho&s;e which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth <HI>Sigulones. Saxo Grammaticus,</HI> and <HI>Albertus Crantzius,</HI> calleth this <HI>Fri&s;iam Eydoren&s;em,</HI> (of the riuer <HI>Eider</HI> vpon which it bordereth) and <HI>Fri&s;iam Minorem,</HI> the Le&s;&s;er <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> both of them ma|king it a branch &s;prung from tho&s;e ancient <HI>Frisij. Cornelius Kempius</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> diuideth the whole country into &s;euen <HI>Zelands,</HI> that is, marine &s;hires, you may terme them. The fir&s;t is vpon the We&s;t of the riuer <HI>Fleuus</HI> or <HI>I&s;el,</HI> and now is called <HI>Waterlandt:</HI> Then <HI>We&s;tergoe,</HI> as who would &s;ay, The We&s;t-land: The third <HI>Oe&s;tergoe,</HI> that is, The Ea&s;t-land. The&s;e three he &s;aith are commonly known and conteined vnder the name of WEST FRIESLAND. The fourth is about the riuer <HI>I&s;el,</HI> where the cities <HI>Dauenter, Swool, Ha&s;&s;elt, Steenwijck</HI> and <HI>Wollenhoue</HI> are &s;eated. The fifth conteineth the liberties of <HI>Groeningen:</HI> The &s;ixt that part which they call Ea&s;t-<HI>Frie&s;land.</HI> The &s;euenth is from the riuer <HI>We&s;er,</HI> beyond <HI>Elbe,</HI> euen vnto the little riuer <HI>Eyder.</HI> Otherwi&s;e this country of the <HI>Frisij,</HI> is vulgarly diuided into three parts, Ea&s;t <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> We&s;t <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> and Middle <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> which of &s;ome is called <HI>Groningen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ptolemey</HI> nameth three towns of the <HI>Frisij, Manarmanis, Phleum,</HI> and <HI>Siatutanda: Fleum Ca&s;tellum</HI> in <HI>Tacitus</HI> is the &s;ame as I thinke that <HI>Phleum</HI> is in <HI>Ptolemey:</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Tacitus</HI> al&s;o maketh mention of <HI>Cruptoricis &s;tipendarij villa</HI> the Mannor of <HI>Cruptorix</HI> the &s;tipendary: Item, the groue of <HI>Baduhenna,</HI> where he greatly lamenteth that 900. Romans had their throats cut, and where another &s;upplie of 400. men, after that they had a &s;u&s;picion of trea&s;on, did one kill another. The &s;ame authour writeth that in his time <HI>Hercules</HI> pillars were heere &s;till remaining. <HI>The braue couragious minde of this nation and high conceit of their owne valour, is manife&s;t by the hi&s;tory of</HI> Verritus <HI>and</HI> Malorix, <HI>two of their princes. For the&s;e (as</HI> Tacitus <HI>reporteth) going to</HI> Rome, <HI>and finding</HI> Nero <HI>the Emperour bu&s;ied about other matters, amongst o|ther things which were v&s;ually &s;hewed to barbarous people, they came into</HI> Pompeys <HI>theatre, that they might behold the greatne&s;&s;e of it. While they &s;ate idly there vpon the &s;caffolds (for they were not caried away altogether with the &s;ight of the pa&s;times, as if they neuer had &s;een &s;uch before) they question about the differences of e&s;tates, what or who was a knight, and where &s;ate the Senatours, they ob&s;erued &s;ome to &s;it in the Senatours rooms in a &s;trange habit: and demanding who they were, after they heard, that that honour was giuen to the Emba&s;&s;adours of tho&s;e nations which for valour, and amity with the Ro|mans did excell others, they cried out with a loud voice,</HI> THERE ARE NO PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, THAT FOR PROVVES AND FIDELITY DO GO BEFORE THE GERMANES: <HI>and thereupon they left their places &amp; placed them|&s;elues in the Senatours roome: and it was well taken of the beholders, as a token of their ancient &s;pirit and earne&s;t emulation of vertue.</HI> Nero <HI>made them both freemen of the city of</HI> Rome.</P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> writeth in the third chapter of the fifth booke of his naturall hi&s;torie, that among&s;t the Frie&s;landers there grow|eth an hearb which they call <HI>Britannica,</HI> hauing long blacke leaues; and a blacke roote. The iuice of this herb is pre&s;&s;ed al&s;o out of the roote. The flowres by a proper name they call <HI>Vibones:</HI> which being gathered before any thunder is heard, and eaten, do wholly pre&s;erue a man from that danger. This herb is not only good and medicinable for the &s;inews, and di&s;ea&s;es of the mouth, but al&s;o again&s;t the Golne or Squinancy and biting of Serpents. Whether this herb be at this day certainly knowne, and by what name, I de&s;ire to be informed of our learned Herbati&s;ts.</P>
<P>Whether that the inhabitants of this prouince be tho&s;e &s;ame <HI>Frisij,</HI> or whether happily they tooke their beginning and name from the Phrygians of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as &s;ome would haue it, or from others of other places, (for <HI>Strabo</HI> acknowled|geth al&s;o certaine <HI>Phrygi</HI> in <HI>Illyria,</HI> about the <HI>Ceraunian</HI> hilles) I leaue to the learned to determine. The idle fables of tho&s;e men I cannot cho&s;e but laugh at, which do thinke that the&s;e <HI>Frisij</HI> came into this country from <HI>Fre&s;ia,</HI> a prouince of <HI>India.</HI> If I were delighted with fables, I had rather with <HI>Hanibald</HI> fetch the name of this people from their king <HI>Fri|&s;us,</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Clodio.</HI> The writers of middle age, e&s;pecially the French, do call them, as I haue ob&s;erued, <HI>Fri&s;ones,</HI> by a name framed of the French word <HI>Fri&s;ons,</HI> by which the Frenchmen at this day vulgarly do call the people of this prouince. They retaine euen to this day the ancient name. For they are commonly, among&s;t them&s;elues in their own language, called <HI>Frie&s;en,</HI> by which name al&s;o they are known throughout all <HI>Germanie.</HI></P>
<P>They were conuerted vnto Chri&s;tianitie by S. <HI>Boniface</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz,</HI> at that &s;ame time when <HI>Zacharie</HI> was Pope of <HI>Rome.</HI> There is a &s;trange hi&s;torie of <HI>Rabod</HI> Duke of <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> who when he &s;hould by Bapti&s;me haue beene con&s;ecrated and adopted into the number of Chri&s;ts flocke, he demanded to what place his Grandfathers and Great|grandfathers were gone before him: and when he vnder&s;tood that they were all gone to Hell, he returned backe again &s;aying, that he had rather be with his ance&s;tors. Whether of this <HI>Rabod</HI> our word <HI>Rahoudt,</HI> whereby in our Mother tongue we &s;ignifie a knaue and a wicked fellow, were deriued, I cannot tell. <HI>Suffridus Petrus Fri&s;ius</HI> hath written ge|nerally of the <HI>Frisij,</HI> in a &s;euerall and peculiar treati&s;e dedicated wholly to this argument: <HI>Cornelius Kempius</HI> and o|thers haue done the like: But <HI>Vbbo Emmius Fri&s;ius Greten&s;is</HI> of all hath done the &s;ame mo&s;t learnedly.</P>

<P><HI>_FRie&s;land</HI> at this day is by the riuer <HI>Eems</HI> diuided into We&s;t-<HI>Frie&s;land</HI> and Ea&s;t-<HI>Frie&s;land.</HI> We&s;t <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> who&s;e de&s;cription we heere do offer vnto thy view, doth by a mo&s;t ancient right chalenge vnto it &s;elfe the name of <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> and was alwaies e&s;teemed the better. For this country had his proper king, vn|till the daies of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: after who&s;e death this prouince was di|uer&s;ly vexed and &s;uffered many greeuous &s;torms of frowning fortunes ire, although indeed before that time al&s;o it had often been a&s;&s;aulted and batte|red by the Danes and Norweies. Yea and the raging Ocean, a continuall and mo&s;t noi&s;ome enemie of this countrie, by ouerflowing, beating vpon it, tearing and rending his walls and banks hath much mole&s;ted the &s;ame, and yet it will not &s;uffer it to be quiet. La&s;tly, how it hath of later daies been troubled by the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Vtrecht</HI> and Earles of <HI>Holland,</HI> I thinke there is no man but doth well remember. But at length, in the daies of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, a very peaceable prince, it enioied peace and re&s;t from all former troubles. At this day they do diuide it into three parts; <HI>We&s;tergoe, Oe&s;tergoe,</HI> and <HI>Seuenwolden:</HI> which againe are di&s;tingui&s;hed into 29. <HI>Gre|tanies,</HI> (as they vulgarly call them in their mother tongue) Courts or principall places appointed for the executing of iu&s;tice. Moreouer in this mappe there is de&s;cribed the territory of the renow|med city <HI>Groningen:</HI> as al&s;o that tract which they call <HI>Ommeland:</HI> to the&s;e are adioined <HI>Ouery&s;el, Drent,</HI> and <HI>Twent,</HI> countries of a fatte and fertile glebe, well inhabited, full of villages and hamlets, bree|ding al&s;o great plenty of cattell.</P>
<P>The cities of We&s;t <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> are thirteen, GROENINGEN, the more famous for that it brought forth the learned <HI>Rodolphus Agricola:</HI> DAM, LIEVVERDT with a faire ca&s;tle: heere is kept the Court or place of Parliament and Chancerie, as they commonly call it: DOCKVM, the place where the famous Mathematician <HI>Gemma Fri&s;ius</HI> was borne: FRANICHER, a common palace, and place of retreit whither the Noblemen and Gentry of this country do for their plea&s;ure retire them&s;elues: BOLSART, SNEECK, where <HI>Ioachim Hopper</HI> a very learned and worthy man, was borne: ILST, SLOTEN, HARLINGEN, vpon an arme of the German ocean; (which they call <HI>Suyderzee,</HI>) hath a commodious hauen; garded with a &s;trong ca&s;tle to defend it from the impechment and a&s;&s;ault of the enemie: WORCKVM and HINDELOPEN, vpon the &s;ame bay: La&s;tly, STAVEREN, which in time pa&s;t hath been a mighty city, but now hauing endured many bitter &s;torms and in|undations of the &s;ea, it is nothing &s;o renowmed nor great. There are be&s;ide the&s;e 490. villages or pari&s;hes, of which diuers are endowed with great priuiledges, and haue many rich farmours: It hath many Mona&s;teries; &s;o that for the beauty of their townes, husbandrie of the land, and &s;tately Abbeies, <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> giueth place to no other country what&s;oeuer. That in this prouince are many gentlemen de&s;cended from honourable families, hauing their hou&s;es and farms in diuers places of the &s;hire, and no Barons or free Lords, the cau&s;e is partly by rea&s;on of the fore&s;aid ca&s;ualities, and partly for that they being contented with their own e&s;tate and liberty, haue not followed the courts of forrein Princes.</P>
<P><HI>Petrus Oliuarus</HI> in his annotations vpon <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> where he &s;peaketh of We&s;t <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> wri|teth, that within &s;o little a circuite of ground he neuer &s;aw &s;o many pari&s;h Churches. There were, &s;aith he, which do alleadge this to haue been the cau&s;e of that multitude of Churches: they report that there aro&s;e a great contention among&s;t the nobility of this country about their places in tho&s;e Churches, euery one contending for the highe&s;t &s;eat: and when as this contention grew euery day wor&s;e and wor&s;e, they determined, as many as were able, to build them &s;euerall Curches, eue|ry man vpon his owne demaines: and &s;o euery man might take the highe&s;t roome in his own &s;eat: and heere grew the cau&s;e of building &s;o many Churches. Thus farre <HI>Oliuarius,</HI> where al&s;o thou mai&s;t &s;ee many things els worth the reading. Moreouer read <HI>Albertus Crantzius,</HI> his <HI>Saxonia.</HI> But he that de&s;ireth a more ample knowledge of this prouince, let him haue recour&s;e vnto the de&s;cription of the Low countries done by <HI>Lewis Guicciardine. Ael&s;ius Edouardus Leon Fri&s;ius</HI> hath de&s;cribed this country in Heroike ver&s;e, dedicated to D. <HI>Viglius Zwichemus: Cornelius Kempius,</HI> and <HI>Suffridus Petrus</HI> haue done the &s;ame at large in peculiar treati&s;es.

<P>_THat the <HI>Frisij,</HI> did not in former times inhabit this tract, but the <HI>Cauchi,</HI> there is none, I thinke, that doubt. Be&s;ide <HI>Strabo, Dion, Suetonius, Paterculus,</HI> and <HI>Ael. Spartianus, Ptolemey,</HI> (who di|&s;tingui&s;heth them into <HI>The Greater,</HI> and <HI>The Le&s;&s;er,</HI>) doth make mention of this people. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth the <HI>Greater Cauchi,</HI> between the riuers <HI>Wei&s;er</HI> and <HI>Elbe:</HI> the Le&s;&s;er, between <HI>Eems</HI> and <HI>Wei&s;er,</HI> where now the&s;e Frie&s;landers, which we call <HI>Ea&s;t-Frie&s;landers,</HI> at this day do dwell. Of the <HI>Cauchi, Pliny</HI> in the fir&s;t Chapter of his &s;ixteenth booke, thus &s;peaketh: <HI>In the North we haue &s;eene, &s;aith he, the countries of the</HI> Cauchi, <HI>the Greater and the Le&s;&s;er, (as they are termed) altoge|ther void of wood and trees. For by an huge in-let there, twi&s;e euery day and night by cour&s;es, the &s;ea runneth in amaine, confu&s;edly couering what&s;oeuer generally the earth bringeth forth; leauing it doubtfull which is &s;ea, and which is land. There the &s;illy di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people get them vp to the toppes of high hills, or mounts rai&s;ed, by labour and indu&s;trie of men, (according to the height of the highe&s;t tide, as they find by experi|ence,) and thereon they build their poore cottages: where they dwell like &s;ailers floting on the waters, when the ocean flowing en|clo&s;eth them round: or like tho&s;e which haue &s;uffered &s;hipwrake, when the waters ebbing returne backe againe: and then they go out to fi&s;h about their cabbines, when they ob&s;erue the fi&s;h to follow the tide. They haue no cattell, they liue not vpon milke and whit-meats as their neighbours do, they hunt not any wild bea&s;t, as being farre from any &s;hrubs or bu&s;hes where they may hide their heads. Of Reike, a kind of &s;eaweed, and ru&s;hes growing vpon the wa&s;hes and boggy places they twi&s;t cords, whereof they make their fi&s;hing nets: and taking vp a kind of muddy earth with their hands, drying it rather with the wind, then with the &s;unne, they v&s;e it for fuell to dre&s;&s;e their meat, and heat their limmes, &s;tarke and &s;tiffe with the cold bla&s;ts of the Northren winds. They haue no other drinke but raine water, which they catch and keep in ditches in the porches of their hou&s;es. Yet the&s;e nations, if they be at this day conquered by the Romanes, they count it no other but &s;lauery and bondage. So it is indeed, fortune is fauourable to &s;ome to their owne hurt and hinderance.</HI> Thus <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth of this people; who wondereth that they preferred liberty, be|fore the tyrannous command of the Romanes, or rather, as I thinke, he enuieth that they were freed from their yoke. For neither is it yet &s;o wonderfull a thing as he would make it, for a free nation, before all things els what&s;oeuer, to maintaine their liberty: which is excellent a thing in his iudgement, &ocirc; <HI>Pliny,</HI> whom thou thy &s;elfe doe&s;t highly commend before all other, who per&s;wadeth vs to maintaine the &s;ame with the vttermo&s;t hazard of our life: and affirmeth it worthily to be de&s;ired and preferred not only of man, but al&s;o of brute bea&s;ts, before all things in the world be&s;ide.</P>
<P>This country in former times was diuided into many Signiories; which &s;euerally were gouerned by their &s;euerall and proper Princes, euen vnto the time of <HI>Fredericke</HI> the third, Emperour of <HI>Rome;</HI> who gaue this whole country vnto one <HI>Vl|ricke,</HI> and created him Earle of the &s;ame, in the yeare after Chri&s;ts natiuity 1465.</P>
<P>The &s;oile of this tract is &s;o rich of all nece&s;&s;arie things, that it &s;eemeth not greatly to &s;tand in need of the help of neighbour countries. Yea it doth &s;o plentifully abound with diuers things, as Hor&s;es, Oxen, Cattell, Hogges, Wool, Butter, Chee&s;e, Barley, Oates, Wheat, Beanes, Pea&s;e, and Salt, that from hence euery yeare they conuey great &s;tore of the&s;e com|modities vnto forrein countries. This County hath but two walled cities, namely, <HI>Eemden</HI> and <HI>Awricke.</HI> Of which EEM|DEN, &s;ituate at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Eems,</HI> is the common Mart-towne of the whole prouince, for concour&s;e of Merchants e&s;pecially famous, which indeed is cau&s;ed by the commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e and opportunity of the hauen, which doth thru&s;t it &s;elfe &s;o farre vp into the heart of the city, at &s;uch a great height and depth, that it doth ea&s;ily receiue and entertaine great &s;hippes, full laden, with &s;ailes &s;tricken into the very midde&s;t of the &s;ame. This city is much beautified with the &s;umptuous palace of the Prince, a gorgeous Church, the Yeeld hall, and the goodly hou&s;es of the priuate citizens. AVRICK, by rea&s;on of the woods and groues which on all &s;ides almo&s;t do inclo&s;e it, is inhabitd for the mo&s;t part of Gentlemen and Noblemen, where they recreate and delight them&s;elues with Hawking and Hunting. In the territorie of this city, there is, as <HI>Kempius</HI> reporteth, a place called <HI>Iyl,</HI> enclo&s;ed round with a wall, be&s;et with bu&s;hes, a commodious dwelling for Hares and Deere: in which as in a Parke or warrein they maintaine a great number of the&s;e kind of bea&s;ts, which none dare take vnder a great penalty: but they are re&s;erued for the Earles di&s;port and pa&s;time when he is di&s;po&s;ed to recreate him&s;elfe with hunting. In the confines al&s;o of this city <HI>Awricke,</HI> is a little hill ri&s;ing &s;omewhat high, (commonly they call it <HI>Ob&s;talsboom</HI> or <HI>Vp&s;talsbom</HI>) where the &s;eat of Iu&s;tice or Court leet for the whole &s;hire is ordinarily held. Heere they were wont euery yeare, out of all the Zelands, to meet in the open and wild fields, and there by the mo&s;t skilfull and approued lawiers, &s;uch as be&s;t knew their cu&s;toms and lawes, to end and determine all controuer&s;ies ari&s;ing between man and man. In this precinct al&s;o are diuen ca&s;tles, villages and farms. Of hamlets and end-waies, &s;uch is the number, that oft times one doth touch another. The greate&s;t part of which both for beauty of their hou&s;es and &s;treets, as al&s;o for multitude of inhabitants and &s;trangers, do &s;o excell, that they may foe honour and greatne&s;&s;e contend with diuers cities of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>The people do giue them&s;elues either to traffique as Merchants, or to get their liuings by occupations and handy-crafts, or by playing the husbandmen and tilling the ground. With their neighbours and forreners they &s;peake in the Dutch tongue, among&s;t them&s;elues they v&s;e a peculiar language, proper to that nation and not vnder&s;tood of &s;trangers. They are comely apparelled, yea euen the very country people, &s;o that a man would take them to be citizens. The women weare a kind of attire and apparell much differing from that of other nations. They bind vp all the haire of their had into one locke, and that, &s;et out with diuers &s;iluer and gilt &s;pangles and buttons, they let to hang behind their backe. Their head they bind vp in Summer with a caull of red coloured &s;ilke, behung with &s;iluer &s;pangles, but in the Winter they weare an hood of green cloth, wherewith they do &s;o couer their whole head, that skar&s;ely one may &s;ee their eies: this kind of attire they call an <HI>Hatte.</HI> Their vpper garment (<HI>huick</HI> of loo&s;e gowne) which they weare abroad, from the head to the foot is pleited with many &s;mall pleits, and is &s;o &s;tiffe with &s;iluer and gilt wire or plate wouen into it, that when it is put off, it will &s;tand vpright. This &s;ome|time is made of red, &s;ometime of green cloth. In this country of <HI>Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land</HI> there are al&s;o two other counties, the one called <HI>E&s;ens,</HI> the other <HI>Ieueren,</HI> bearing the names of their chiefe towns.

<P><HI>_SAxo Grammaticus</HI> hath thus de&s;cribed <HI>Denmarke:</HI> DENMARKE, &s;aith he, parted in the midde&s;t by the boi&s;terous &s;ea, conteineth a few &s;mall parts of the maine continent, &s;euered and di&s;ioined one from another by the breaking in of the ocean winding and turning it &s;elfe diuers waies. Of the&s;e IVTIA, <HI>Iuitland,</HI> is, in re&s;pect of the greatne&s;&s;e and beginning, in the enterance of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Which as it is in &s;ituation fir&s;t, &s;o running out further, it is placed in the vtmo&s;t borders of <HI>Germany.</HI> From who&s;e company it being parted by the intercour&s;e of the riuer <HI>Eydor,</HI> it runneth with a larger breadth toward the North, euen to the banke of the frith of <HI>Norwey</HI> (he calleth it <HI>Fre|tum Noricum.</HI>) In this is the bay of <HI>Lemwicke, (Sinus Lymicus)</HI> abounding with &s;uch &s;tore of fi&s;h, that it alone yeeldeth as much proui&s;ion of victuall to the inhabitants, as all the whole country be|&s;ide. To this is adioined FRESIA, <HI>(Strand Frie&s;en)</HI> a prouince much le&s;&s;er, which lying more low then <HI>Iuitland</HI> in plaine and champion fields, receiueth from the &s;ea ouerflowing it, great &s;trength and heart, and is very &s;et|tile for come. Who&s;e inundation or violent tide, whether it do bring to the country people more profit or dammage, it is hard to &s;ay: For in tempe&s;tuous weather the Sea breaking in through the creeks wherein the water was wont to be contained, &s;uch a world of waters oft times doth follow and come into the country, that diuers times it runneth ouer not only the fallow fields, but drowneth al&s;o whole families with their goods and cattell. After <HI>Iuitland,</HI> the ile FIONIA, <HI>(Fuinex)</HI> doth follow vpon the Ea&s;t, which a narrow arme of the ocean &s;ea doth &s;euer from the maine land. This iland as vpon the We&s;t it looketh toward <HI>Iuitland,</HI> &s;o vpon the Ea&s;t it hath the ile SEELAND, (<HI>Sialandia,</HI> he calleth it) an iland much commended for the great abun|dance of all maner of nece&s;&s;ary things that it yeeldeth: which for plea&s;ant &s;ituation is thought to excell all the prouinces of this kingdome, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the midde&s;t of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> indifferently &s;ituate between the one end of the &s;ame, and the other. Vpon the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this, an arme of the ocean runneth between it and SCONE, (<HI>Scania, Scandinauia, Ba&s;ilia</HI> and <HI>Baltia</HI> called by diuers authours) a part of <HI>Norwey</HI> or <HI>Swedland.</HI> This &s;ea yearely affoordeth great gaine to the Fi&s;hermen. For this whole bay or gulfe of the &s;ea, is &s;o full of all &s;orts of fi&s;h, that the fi&s;hermen oft times do catch &s;uch &s;tore and therewith they &s;o fraight their boats, that they haue no roome to &s;tirre their oares: neither do they heere v&s;e any nets or other meanes to take the fi&s;h, but many times they are taken only with the hand. Moreouer HALLAND and BLIEKER, (<HI>Blekingia</HI> he nameth it) two prouinces, i&s;&s;uing forth from the maine land of <HI>Scone,</HI> like two armes from one and the &s;ame body of a tree, are, by many &s;paces and by-corners, adioined and knitte to <HI>Gotland</HI> and <HI>Norwey.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Saxo Grammaticus.</HI> See al&s;o <HI>Albert Crantzius, Seba|&s;tian Mun&s;ter,</HI> and the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall hi&s;tory of <HI>M.

<P>The kingdome of NORVVAY, is &s;ubiect to the crowne of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> as al&s;o the ile GOTLAND: <HI>Item,</HI> (if you will giue cre|dit to <HI>Marke Iordane</HI> in his mappe of <HI>Denmarke</HI>) the ilands <HI>Groenland, I&s;land, Hetland, Feroa,</HI> and the <HI>Orkneys.</HI> Yet we haue &s;aid before that the Orkney iles do belong vnto the kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> vnder the name and title of a Dukedome. <HI>Olaus</HI> al&s;o &s;aith, but fal&s;ly as I per&s;wade my &s;elfe, that the ile <HI>Gotland</HI> doth belong vnto the kingdome of <HI>Swedland.</HI></P>
<P>GOTHIA, or the ile <HI>Gotland</HI> is a good ground for the feeding and bringing vp of cattell, hor&s;es and oxen. There is plentifull fi&s;hing, fowling and hunting. It is very rich of a kind of faire marble, as al&s;o of all maner of things nece&s;&s;ary for the mainte|nance of mans life. In it is the goodly towne <HI>Visbui,</HI> &s;ometime the mo&s;t famous and frequent Mart of all <HI>Europe.</HI> There are yet remaining certaine ruines of marble, &s;ufficient te&s;timony of his ancient greatne&s;&s;e and beauty: at this day it is now renowmed for the faire Abbey of Benedictine Friers; and the Library there containing about 2000. bookes of &s;undry authours, rare and ancient manu&s;cripts.

<P>_OF <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> thus <HI>Crantzius</HI> in the &s;euen and twentieth Chapter of his fifth booke of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Sa|xony: Hol&s;tatia</HI> tooke the name of a vulgar word of thar language: for that the country is woody and full of forre&s;ts, to di&s;tingui&s;h between the&s;e parts and the other neere adioining, which are moori&s;h and green pa&s;ture grounds. The Saxons call the inhabitants <HI>Hol&s;aten,</HI> that is, people dwelling a|mong&s;t the woods: on the contrary tho&s;e which dwell in fenny countries they call <HI>Mer&s;tude.</HI> There|of the Latines haue formed he names <HI>Hol&s;ati, Hol&s;atia, (Hol&s;aten</HI> and <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI>) like as the French and Italians are from their own languages wont to enrich the Latine tongue. Vpon the Ea&s;t, this country is bounded by the riuer <HI>Bilene,</HI> on the We&s;t by <HI>Store,</HI> on the South by <HI>Elbe</HI> or <HI>Elue;</HI> on the North by <HI>Eydore,</HI> which in time pa&s;t was the furthe&s;t bound of <HI>Denmarke.</HI> From this riuer Ea&s;tward the <HI>Wandalles</HI> or <HI>Vandalles</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Wagers</HI> did inhabit: of whom that prouince was named WAGRIA, of an ancient (and &s;ometime a populous) city of that name, now a poore village little inhabited, without wall, trench, rampart or fence: the hou&s;es are couered with reeds gathered in the fennes, homely and country like: it runneth out Ea&s;tward as farre as the riuer <HI>Trauenna.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding that part of the country, which from the riuer <HI>Bilene</HI> by <HI>Elbe</HI> decli|neth toward the riuer <HI>Store,</HI> and of that riuer is called <HI>Stormare,</HI> leaueth but a little ground to the old <HI>Hol&s;atia,</HI> from <HI>Store</HI> to <HI>Ey|dore.</HI> For the Dietmar&s;hers a people inhabiting in mourni&s;h and fenny places, do claime a freedome and priuiledge from the iu|ri&s;diction of any other Prince. This <HI>Crantzius</HI> in his time wrote of the &s;tate of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> then. Whereupon it is apparant that <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> was diuided into <HI>Thietmar&s;h, Wagria,</HI> and <HI>Stormare.</HI> The &s;ame <HI>Crantzius</HI> and others, do al&s;o call the&s;e Hol&s;aters, <HI>Tran|&s;abianos</HI> and <HI>Nordalbianos,</HI> as &s;ituate beyond and vpon the North-&s;ide of the riuer <HI>Elbe,</HI> called of the Latines <HI>Albis.

For he affirmeth that <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> as now it is called, generally doth comprehend the Dukedome of <HI>Sle&s;wicke, Wagria, Stormare, Dietmar&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Iuitland,</HI> with certaine other le&s;&s;er countries and ilands; as namely, <HI>Angle-land, Swant-land,</HI> and <HI>Wen&s;u&s;&s;et</HI> anciently called <HI>Cimbrica Cher&s;one&s;us.</HI> But this limitation is &s;omewhat too large: for the &s;ame authour doth pre&s;ently after write, that <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> properly is bounded with tho&s;e foure riuers, within which <HI>Crantzius</HI> doth re&s;trein it. Although that <HI>Annonius</HI> the Monke, as he citeth there, in &s;teed of the riuer <HI>Eyder</HI> doth place vpon the North, the wall and trench which the country people call <HI>Denwerk.</HI> And this is that <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> which this our Mappe pre&s;enteth vnto thy view. That the <HI>Cimbri</HI> a warlicke people did long &s;ince inhabit this tract, it is very apparant out of the writings of mo&s;t approved authours.</P>
<P>In <HI>Wagria</HI> or <HI>Wagreland, Crantzius</HI> reckoneth vp the&s;e cities; <HI>Oldenburgh, Luthenburgh, Nie&s;tade</HI> or <HI>Nige&s;tad, Tode&s;to, Ze|gebergh, Plone &amp;c.</HI> In <HI>Stormare, Hamburgh, Reinoldesborgh, Itzeho, Niemun&s;ter &amp;c.

<HEAD>THIETMARSIA, or DIETMARSH.</HEAD>
<P>_OF the MARSI, de&s;cended from <HI>Mar&s;us, Strabo</HI> the ancient Geographer &s;peaketh: and &s;aith that many yeares &s;ince they went from the coa&s;ts about the <HI>Rhein,</HI> into a low and moori&s;h country. Of the&s;e are come the THEVTOMARSI, or, as they commonlie pronounce the word, the <HI>Thietmar&s;i,</HI> (the Dietmar&s;hers) who about 400. yeares agone, were gouerned by the mo&s;t ancient family of <HI>Staden,</HI> many of which they treacherou&s;ly &s;lew, and &s;o at length they made them&s;elues free, by killing &amp; bani&s;hing all their Nobility. <HI>Henry,</HI> &s;urnamed the <HI>Lion,</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> &s;ubdued them: but he being out-lawed by the Emperour <HI>Fredericke, Walemare</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke</HI> &s;eized vpon the country, and when as he v&s;ed their helpe again&s;t <HI>Adolph</HI> Earle of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> and the Lubeckers, they reuolted vnto the enemies, by whom the king was ouercome at the village <HI>Bornhouet.</HI> Thus againe being re&s;tored vnto their liberty, lea&s;t they might &s;eeme to be <HI>Anarchi,</HI> &s;ubiect to no Iuri&s;diction, they &s;hrowded them&s;elues vnder the patronage of the Arch|hi&s;hop of <HI>Breme,</HI> and him they acknowledged for their Prince: but yet they would neuer pay him tribute or &s;ub|&s;idie, nor euer would be obedient to his lawes or commands. Often the Dukes of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> haue attempted wars again&s;t them, and alwaies they &s;uffered the repul&s;e. <HI>Fredericke</HI> the third, Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> gaue the country to <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the fir&s;t, king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> vnder the title of a Dukedome: who&s;e &s;onne <HI>Iohn,</HI> making war vpon them in the yeare 1500. lo&s;t the day, all his forces being ouerthrowen, him&s;elfe with a very few hardly e&s;caped by flight, leauing behind him the greate&s;t part of the nobility of <HI>Hol&s;tein.</HI> After that, they grew more in&s;olent by this victory, and oft greatly troubled and mole&s;ted the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein. Adolph</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Fredericke</HI> king of <HI>Den|marke,</HI> heire to the kingdome of <HI>Norway,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Sle&s;wicke</HI> and <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> not being able to endure their male-part in&s;olencie, in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1559. mu&s;tereth his men, gathereth a great army, to whom <HI>Fredericke</HI> the &s;econd, king of <HI>Demnarke,</HI> and <HI>Iohn</HI> his brother, ioine their forces. The&s;e armies thus vnited, &s;et forward, and pre&s;ently take <HI>Meldorp,</HI> with all the South part of the prouince. Then after a few daies re&s;pite, they ledde their forces along by <HI>Tilenbrugge,:</HI> again&s;t whom the Dietmar&s;hers out of <HI>Hemmingstade</HI> make head with all their pow|er, and met the enemy before the towne <HI>Heyde;</HI> entending to force the &s;ouldiers to retire being wearied with a tedious march: but oft repelled, and yet charging againe afre&s;h, at length they are beaten downe, killed, forced to flie, and the towne is taken and fired. There were &s;laine that day about 3000. Dietmar&s;hers. Duke <HI>Adolph</HI> labouring like a valiant captaine, to keep his men in aray, and to bring them on againe which began to flie, re|ceiued an hurt. This battell was fought vpon the thirteenth day of Iune. The Dietmar&s;hers hauing receiued this ouerthrow, &s;ubmitted them&s;elues to the King and the Dukes, and obteining pardon, they were againe re|ceiued to grace: and thus <HI>Dietmar&s;h,</HI> which for many ages together by force of armes had defended and main|tained their liberty, became &s;ubiect to the Dukes of <HI>Hol&s;tein.</HI> This the authour of this Mappe, which heere we haue in&s;erted into our Theater, hath written of this country. See al&s;o <HI>Albert Crantzius</HI> his Chronicle of <HI>Saxony. Chri&s;tianus Silicius,</HI> a Dane, hath lately &s;et forth a little Treati&s;e, in which he hath de&s;cribed the&s;e warres between the Danes and the Dietmar&s;hers, and other things which do much make for the better vnder&s;tanding of this tract.</P>

<P>_THis country tooke his name from <HI>Oldenburg,</HI> the chiefe city. <HI>Albertus Crantzius</HI> in his <HI>Metropolis</HI> in the fifteenth chapter of the third booke, writeth that this is one of the mo&s;t ancient Earledomes of <HI>Germany:</HI> for in the thirty chapter of his &s;econd booke, he reckoneth <HI>Widekind,</HI> Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, among&s;t the Earles of this country. <HI>Iraenicus</HI> affirmeth that this city was repaired by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, who al&s;o there dedicated a church to S. <HI>Iohn Bapti&s;t,</HI> con&s;ecrated by <HI>Edalgarge</HI> the Bi&s;hop.

<P>_ALthough this Mappe do beare the title of <HI>Saxony,</HI> notwith&s;tanding it conteineth not all <HI>Saxony:</HI> for the true and ancient <HI>Saxony</HI> was comprehended in former times between the riuers <HI>Elue</HI> and <HI>Rhein,</HI> according to his vttermo&s;t length: the breadth of it was re&s;trained by the Germane &s;ea, and the riuer <HI>Eydore,</HI> and the borders of <HI>He&s;&s;en</HI> and <HI>Thuringen. Brun&s;wicke</HI> was almo&s;t in the center and midde&s;t of it. But now it is not bounded with tho&s;e or &s;uch like naturall bounds, &s;uch as riuers and mountaines are; but it is confined by other Princes &s;igniories and countries. Therefore <HI>Saxony</HI> at this day is diuided into the Vpper and Neather. The Vpper or High <HI>Saxony</HI> is that which this Mappe doth repre&s;ent, and is graced with the title of a Dukedome: who&s;e Duke al&s;o is one of the Princes Electours, which haue their voices in the choo&s;ing of the Empe|rour. The chiefe townes of this prouince are <HI>VVitteberg</HI> and <HI>Torga.</HI> Of <HI>Saxony</HI> and the antiquities of the &s;ame, <HI>Albert Crantz</HI> hath written a whole volume.

Pet. Albinus Niuemontius</HI> very lately, and <HI>Dauid Chytraeus,</HI> haue written very learnedly of this prouince.</P>
<P>Of the Marque&s;ate of BRANDENBVRG, LVSATIA, <HI>(Lau&s;&s;nitz)</HI> and VOITLAND, countries which we haue al&s;o de&s;cribed in this Chart, take the&s;e few lines; The Marque&s;ate of BRANDENBVRG, one of tho&s;e prouinces which in old time were inhabited of the <HI>Wandalls,</HI> is diuided at this day into the Old and the New; by this runneth the riuer <HI>Oder,</HI> by that <HI>Elue, Albis</HI> the Latines call it. In the old Mar|que&s;ate the chiefe city is <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> whereof the whole country tooke his name. The New hath the city <HI>Franckford:</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Franckford</HI> vpon <HI>Oder,</HI> to make a difference between it and that which is &s;ituate vpon the riuer <HI>Meyn.</HI> Heere is an Vniuer&s;itie, and a great Mart kept twi&s;e euery yeare. At <HI>Berline;</HI> is the Princes court ordinarily kept. Him, of the Marque&s;ate they commonly call the <HI>Marque&s;&s;e:</HI> he al&s;o is one of the Prince Electours.</P>
<P>VOITLAND is a little &s;hire &s;ubiect to the Marque&s;&s;e. This <HI>Aeneas Syluius</HI> calleth <HI>Aduocatorum terram,</HI> and <HI>Praetorianam,</HI> the Sollicitours or Controwlers land, framing a word from the Etymologie or true meaning of the Germaine name; for <HI>Voyt,</HI> in the Dutch tongue &s;ignifieth a Sollicitour or Controwler. So called for that &s;ometime the Prince of this country was one of the foure controwlers of the Roman Empire. The townes of better note are the&s;e, as <HI>Ga&s;per Bru&s;chius</HI> thus reckoneth them vp in Mun&s;ters Co&s;mographie: <HI>Curia Regnitiana, Renitz</HI> court, commonly called <HI>Hoff,</HI> (&s;o named of the riuers which runne by it and there falling into <HI>Sala,</HI>) a great city and very populous, beautified with the goodly and &s;tately Church of S. <HI>Michael,</HI> a large Mona&s;tery of Nunnes, and two rich Ho&s;pitalls. <HI>Plauhenium,</HI> or <HI>Plaun;</HI> a city with a ca&s;tell. <HI>Ol&s;nitz,</HI> which the ca&s;tell <HI>Voytzberg,</HI> neere adioining. <HI>Adorff,</HI> and <HI>Weidonium, (Weyda</HI> as I thinke) a faire towne, with certaine Abbeies about them, <HI>Milford</HI> and <HI>VVhite-crowne, Geraw Scletz,</HI> and what&s;oeuer is between the <HI>Hoff</HI> and <HI>Cygney,</HI> &s;tanding vpon the riuer <HI>El&s;ter, (Halle&s;tra,</HI> the Latines call it.)

VVolfangus Iob&s;tius</HI> hath written a curious de&s;cription of the Marque|&s;ate of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI></P>
<P>LVSATIA, <HI>Lau&s;&s;nitz,</HI> is diuided into <HI>Ober Lau&s;&s;nitz,</HI> and <HI>Nider Lau&s;&s;nitz,</HI> the Vpper, and the Neather: it is al&s;o is a part of <HI>Saxony,</HI> as <HI>Rithaymer</HI> te&s;tifieth.

Sometime it was a part of <HI>Mei&s;en, (Mi&s;nia,)</HI> and was adioined to it: but the Bohemi|ans; who laboured by all meanes to enlarge the bounds of their kingdome and command, at length &s;eized it into their hands. The people in maners, conditions and language do not much differ from the Sile&s;ians: only they are di&s;tinct from them by name, and iuri&s;diction, as gouerned by &s;euerall Princes. The name and appellation of <HI>Lu&s;atia,</HI> is &s;omewhat neere in &s;ound to the name of <HI>Elysij,</HI> or <HI>Lygij,</HI> which it is certaine, as <HI>Ioachinus Cureus</HI> writeth, &s;ometime dwelt heere about.

Heere al&s;o is <HI>A&s;cher leuben,</HI> which in their language is as much to &s;ay, as, <HI>The hou&s;e of A&s;chenez.</HI> There is al&s;o a lake, which of A&s;cenez, is called <HI>A|&s;cher&s;lebi&s;che &s;ee.</HI> This countrie hath vpon the Ea&s;t, the riuer Sala, the territories of the Archbi&s;hopricke of Magdeburg, and the Dioce&s;&s;e of Mer&s;eburg: on the South lieth, Turingen; on the We&s;t, the Counties of Swartzburg, and Stolberg, the Principalities of Sangerhou&s;e, Anhalt, and A&s;&s;eburg. So that the&s;e Earles of Mansfield (which are al&s;o called, <HI>The noble Lords of Heldrungen</HI>) haue the&s;e princes their neere neighbours: the Archbi&s;hop of Magdeburg, the bi&s;hop of Mer&s;eburg, the Prince Electour of Saxony, the Landgraue of Thuringia, the Duke of Saxony, the bi&s;hop of Halber|&s;tade, the Prince of Anhald, the Lord of Bernburg, the Earles of Swartzburg and Stolburg, the Lords of Werther and A&s;&s;eburg.</P>
<P>When, or by whom, this prouince was graced with the title of an EARLDOME, Andrew Hop|penrode, in his booke, which he hath written &amp; &s;et forth of the Petigrees of the Saxon Princes, plainly confe&s;&s;eth that he is altogether ignorant. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;ame authour, and with him Syriacus Spangeberg, do auerre it to haue beene very ancient, by this, that an Earle of this country, called Her|ger, did liue in the daies of Great Arthur, that renowmed king of the Britans, and was one of tho&s;e, which together with the re&s;t of the worthies of this king, were fir&s;t made <HI>Knights of the order of the Round Table.</HI> Now this king Arthur, we know liued about 542. yeres after the incarnation of our Sauior Chri&s;t. But if there be any man that &s;hall thinke and obiect, that this &s;torie of the Round Table is too fabulous to confirme this our a&s;&s;ertion, yet this is certaine and cannot be doubted of, that in England, almo&s;t in the midde&s;t of the kingdome, there is a towne called Mansfield, &s;ituate betweeene the riuers of Trent and Rotheram, not farre from the city of Nottingham.</P>
<P>This county containeth al&s;o foure other counties: namely, ARNSTEDT, WIPRA, WETHIN and QVERNFVRT, all which in former times had their proper and peculiar Earles, but now at this day be&s;ide the counte Mansfield they haue not any one. In this county al&s;o there is the county Palatine of Saxony. Moreouer there are be&s;ide the&s;e certaine other Lord&s;hips and Principalities, as thou mai&s;t &s;ee in the Mappe. The chiefe and principall cities are MANSFIELD, EYSLEBEN, WIPRA and LEIMBACH.</P>
<P>This country is very full of Mettall-mines.

<P>There is a Lake in this country, which, by rea&s;on of the &s;altne&s;&s;e of the water, they call <HI>Ge&s;altzen,</HI> in|to which, if the fi&s;hermen &s;hall ca&s;t in their nets ouer deepe, they will pre&s;ently be &s;ienged &amp; &s;chorched euen as if they had beene burnt or drawne through the fire, as Seuerinus Gobelinus, in his hi&s;tory of Amber, reporteth.

<HEAD>The Principality of HENNENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>_THe terrirory and precinct of the Princes of HENNENBERG, a part of Ea&s;t France, how large and wide it was, you may &s;ee by this our Chorographicall Mappe; the buts and bounds of it are thus: Vpon the We&s;t and North it hath Thuringen, and the great fore&s;t, which of this countrie is called <HI>Durynger Waldt;</HI> (who&s;e head on the&s;e parts doth diuide Thuringen from Frankenland) on the South it is confined with the riuer of Meyn, and the bi&s;hoprickes of Bamberg and Wuitzburg. Moreouer the Ea&s;t part is enclo&s;ed with that great mountaine which the country people do call, <HI>Die Rhon,</HI> or <HI>Ro&s;n:</HI> vpon the &s;ame &s;ide al&s;o it hath the Dioce&s;&s;e of Fulden, and the prouince of He&s;&s;en. This country is wonderfully &s;tored with deere, wild fowle, fi&s;h and &s;uch other things nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of mans life. It hath al&s;o &s;ome Mines of mettals, e&s;pecially of iron, whereof great &s;tore is yearely from hence, to the great gaine and commodity of the inhabitants, tran&s;ported into forren countries. It is watered heere and there with many and diuers fountaines, heads, or &s;prings of the riuer <HI>Vi&s;urgis,</HI> which in the&s;e parts they call <HI>Die Werra,</HI> but mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e properly, it is of &s;ome in other places called <HI>Die We&s;&s;er,</HI> which indeed the name of the Abbey <HI>Ve&s;&s;er</HI> doth &s;eeme to approoue for truth: which Francis Irenicus and Wolfgangus Lazius do verily beleeue to haue beene &s;o denominated of <HI>Wa&s;&s;er,</HI> which in the Ger|mane is as much to &s;ay, as <HI>water,</HI> in the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Of the fir&s;t beginning and originall of this hou&s;e or family of Hennenberg, by rea&s;on of the negligence of the writers and Hi&s;torians of tho&s;e times, we can determine nothing for certainty, be&s;ide this, that in the time of Attila and Charles the Great, &s;ome authours do make mention of the Princes of Hennenberg, which al&s;o were Earles of Frankland and Burggraues of Wurtzeburg. So againe in the time of Henry the fir&s;t, Empe|rour of Germany, Gottwald and Otto of this hou&s;e of Hennenberg, &s;erued valiantly in defence of the Empire again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults and inrodes of the <HI>Vgri.</HI> Item the <HI>Boppones,</HI> two learned men of this family, in the yeares of Chri&s;t 941. and 961. were bi&s;hops of Wurtzeburg, and gouerned that &s;ea with the great applau&s;e and prai&s;e of all men. But the true pedigree of the&s;e Princes is deriued from BOPPO, who in the yeare of our Lord 1078. following Henry the fourth, the Emperours &s;ide, in the battell fought betweene him and Rudolph the Switzer, neere to the city Mel|rich&s;tadt, valiantly fighting was honourablie &s;laine in the field. After him &s;ucceeded his &s;onne GOTTEBALD, fir&s;t founder of the Abbey of Ve&s;&s;er, for the Monkes of the order of the brotherhood of the Praemon&s;traten&s;es: After him followed his &s;onne BERTHOLD; then BOPPO the Second, next him BOPPO the Third, all which &s;ucceeded one after another in a right line. This Boppo the Third had by his &s;econd wife <HI>Iut|ta,</HI> of Thuringen, HERMAN, who&s;e &s;onne BOPPO the Fourth died, leauing no i&s;&s;ue behind him: But by his fir&s;t wife <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> of the familie of the Princes of Saxony, he had HENRY, who had i&s;&s;ue HENRY the Second, HERMAN the Second, and BERTHOLD the Second: Hen|ry had i&s;&s;ue BOPPO the Fift; who&s;e &s;onne BERTHOLD the Third died without i&s;&s;ue. But after Herman the&s;e Princes, HENRY the Second, HERMAN the Third, FREDERICK the Fir&s;t, GEORGE the Fir&s;t, and la&s;tly FREDERICK the Second lineally de&s;cended one from ano|ther, &s;ucce&s;&s;iuely gouerned this prouince. This Fredericke had i&s;&s;ue HERMAN, who by his wife <HI>Margaret,</HI> of the family of Brandenburg had two &s;onnes, BERTHOLD the Fourth, and ALBERT, both which died in the yeare of our Lord God, 1549. and left no i&s;&s;ue behind them. Then of the line of Berthold the Second, third &s;onne of Henry the Fir&s;t, &s;ucceeded BERTHOLD the Fift, who for his &s;ingular virtues, wi&s;edome, expe|rience, and excellent gifts other waies, was in the yeare after Chri&s;ts incarnation, 1310. by Henry of Lutzelburg the Emperour, with the generall con&s;ent of the whole company of the Electours, in&s;talled one of the Princes of the Empire. And after that, for the &s;ame his virtues, and for that he was in managing all maner of bu&s;ine&s;&s;es a mo&s;t prudent, faithfull and fortunate man, by Lewis the Fourth, the next &s;ucce&s;&s;our in the Empire, much &s;et by and greatly e&s;teemed. In his time, this whole prouince as it is heere &s;et out, in this our Chorographicall Chart, was &s;ubiect to him and to o|ther Princes and Earles of Hennenberg then liuing. But HENRY his &s;onne dying without i&s;&s;ue male, the greate&s;t part of this countrey, by the marriage of his three daughters, KATHARINE, SOPHIA, and ELIZABETH, fell vnto the Marque&s;&s;es of Mi&s;nia, Burggraues of Noriberg, and Princes of Wurtenburg, which two la&s;t &s;elling their portions, the bi&s;hop of Wurtenburg did much enlarge his dioce&s;&s;e. IOHN, the &s;econd &s;onne of Berthold the fir&s;t, by his wife <HI>Adelheida</HI> of the hou&s;e of He&s;&s;en, had by <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of the family of Luchtenburg, a &s;onne named HENRY the Fourth, who by <HI>Mechtilda,</HI> or Mawd, daughter to the Marque&s;&s;e of Bath, WILLIAM the Fir&s;t, who by his wife <HI>Anna</HI> of Brun&s;wicke, had WILLIAM the Second, which by <HI>Katharine,</HI> Counte&s;&s;e of Hanaw, had i&s;&s;ue WILLIAM the Fourth, begotten of his wife <HI>Margaret</HI> daughter to the Duke of Brun&s;wicke. This William had by his wife <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ia,</HI> daughter of Albert, Prince Electour of Brandenburg, &s;euen <HI>&s;onnes,</HI> and &s;ix <HI>daughters,</HI> namely WILLIAM, and CASPAR, which died in their infancy: IOHN, Abbot of Fulden: WOLFGANG and CHRISTOPHER, which two died bachelours: GEORGE ERNEST and BOPPO the Sixt: This Boppo, after the death of his fir&s;t wife <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter to the Marque&s;&s;e of Brandenburg, maried <HI>Sophia,</HI> daughter to the Prince of Luneburg; he died vpon the fourth of March in the yeere of our Lord 1574. leauing no i&s;&s;ue behind him. He was a very godly, prudent, magnanimous and curtuous Prince. That other, George Erne&s;t, after the death of his wife <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter to the Duke of Brun&s;wicke, maried <HI>Elizabeth</HI> daughter to the Prince of Wurtenburg, and at length vpon the &s;euen and twentieth day of December in the yeare of our Lord God 1583. yeelded to Nature and died in the &s;euentie and third yeare of his age, being the la&s;t Prince of that &s;tocke or family. The de&s;cription of this prouince of Hennenberg, as heere it is &s;et downe, at this day is &s;ubiect vnto diuers Princes: the greate&s;t part of it, belongeth to the Duke of Saxony, the re&s;t to the bi&s;hop of Wurtenburg and the Landtgraues of He&s;&s;en. A more large and exact de&s;cription of this Stocke and Family, if any man be de&s;irous to haue, may be learned out of the Genealogy or Pedigree of M.

<P>_THis <HI>Prouince</HI> was &s;ometime a <HI>Kingdome,</HI> at this day it is onley graced with the title of a LANDTGRAVY. It is &s;eated betweene the two riuers Sala and Werra.

In this narrow compa&s;&s;e, (as I remember not long &s;ince Hugh Brinkhor&s;t, an Engli&s;hman, a citizen of Erford, my good friend, did tell me) there are 12.

It is a pa&s;sing fertile country, and of wheat and &s;uch like corne it yeeldeth greater plenty than any other country of Germany what&s;oeuer. Whereupon George Agricola doubted not to call it <HI>Sumen Germaniae,</HI> The Sweet-bread of Germany. Heere yearely groweth great plenty of woad (<HI>I&s;atis,</HI> the Latines call it) which from hence is tran&s;ported into other countries, to the great gaine and commodity of the inha|bitants: It is an herbe or weed much v&s;ed of Diers, to &s;et the more perfect and durable colour in wooll or wollen cloth.

<HEAD>The Dukedomes of BRVNSWIICK and LVNENBVRG.</HEAD>
<P>_THe&s;e two regions are at this pre&s;ent &s;ubiect to one Prince. They are both named of the principall cities, <HI>Brun&s;wijck</HI> and <HI>Lunenburg.</HI> The city of <HI>Brun&s;wijck</HI> was about the yeere 860. built by <HI>Bruno</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Ludolphus,</HI> who (as <HI>Crantzius</HI> &s;aith) fir&s;t erected a &s;treet or borough, calling it <HI>Brunonis vicus,</HI> whereupon the whole citie hath euer &s;ince beene called <HI>Brun&s;wijck.</HI> A place of great renowme, &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Onadri,</HI> which falles into the <HI>We&s;er.</HI> The beginnings of this towne were &s;mall. Howbeit in proce&s;&s;e of time, and by degrees, it is now growen to &s;uch &s;tate, ri|ches, and &s;trength, as the Princes thereof are worthily called Dukes of <HI>Brun&s;wijck.</HI> But it was very long fir&s;t. For of an|cient times they bare only the title of Lords: but vnder <HI>Frederick</HI> the Emperour, in the yeere 1235, renewing their &s;tile, they were ordained Dukes. This is one of the &s;euentie Han&s;e-townes. From which &s;ocietie, by a generall Councell of all the &s;aid townes held at <HI>Lubeck anno</HI> 1381, they were excluded, in regard of a mo&s;t cruell and bloudy &s;edition, where|in the greate&s;t part of their Aldermen they &s;lue, and the re&s;t they bani&s;hed. And &s;o they were depriued of the benefit of the &s;aid &s;ocietie for eight yeeres, vntill they had done publike penance and &s;atisfaction. From which time they were ad|mitted anew into the &s;aid incorporation of the Han&s;e: that is to &s;ay, to be partakers of all priuileges granted by Princes and gouernours of former times to all that were free of the &s;aid &s;ocietie, in tho&s;e foure famous marts; to wit, <HI>London</HI> in <HI>England, Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flanders, Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> and <HI>Nouogrod</HI> in <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ia.</HI> Their tutelary &s;aint or protectour they holde to be <HI>S. Anthor</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, whilome Bi&s;hop of <HI>Triers.</HI> For the honour of who&s;e body, becau&s;e it could not be brought within their city walles, they erected a mona&s;tery vnder the title of <HI>S. Giles,</HI> then neere vnto the walles; but now (the city being in|larged) within the &s;ame. Thus much out of <HI>Crantzius</HI> his &s;tory of <HI>Saxonie</HI> and <HI>Wandalia.</HI> The prai&s;e of this citie you may finde in <HI>Aeneas Siluius</HI> his 23. chap. of <HI>Europe.</HI> The citie of LVNEBVRG, built about the yeere of Chri&s;t 1190. vpon an hill named <HI>Calcarium,</HI> was &s;o called, not (as the ignorant imagine) from <HI>Idolum lunae</HI> the idol of the moone, which <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar,</HI> or I wot not who, did there con&s;ecrate; for this is but an old wiues tale;) but from a place not farre off by the riuer <HI>Elmenou</HI> called <HI>Luna,</HI> where there hath for many yeeres continued a cloi&s;ter of Nunnes. It is a citie of great &s;trength, en|uironed with ditches and walles. The citizens greate&s;t traffique is for &s;alt: for here are mo&s;t plentifull and rich &s;alt-pits, out of which they rai&s;e exceed|ing gaines. For &s;alt is here boiled in great quantitie, and vented from hence both by &s;ea and land to <HI>Hamborough, Lubeck,</HI> and other places. The&s;e &s;alt-mines were fir&s;t found in the yeere of Chri&s;t 1269. This city of <HI>Luneburg</HI> with the territory adiacent, is in a peculiar Treati&s;e de&s;cribed by <HI>Lucas Lo&s;&s;ius.</HI> Of <HI>Hilde&s;heim</HI> fiue miles di&s;tant from <HI>Brun&s;wijck, M.

<P>In this Table vpon the riuer <HI>We&s;er</HI> or <HI>Vi&s;urgis</HI> &s;tands the citie of <HI>Hamelen;</HI> concerning which, the learned and famous Phy&s;itian <HI>D. Arnold Fretaghius</HI> wrote to me in a letter the &s;tory en&s;uing; his words be the&s;e: I chanced of late to light vpon a Saxon, and a Chronicler of <HI>Saxonie.</HI> <Q REND="inline">He reports, that 130. yeres ago the citie of <HI>Hamelen,</HI> vnder the iuri&s;diction of Duke <HI>Ericus,</HI> being exceedingly pe&s;tered with mice, there came a iugler that offered his &s;eruice to the townes-men to driue them away: this offer was mo&s;t acceptable vnto them, becau&s;e they could keepe nothing in &s;afetie from tho&s;e mi&s;chieuous vermine. Being agreed with the townes-men, by the &s;ound of a bell he drawes all the mice out of the citie. Then he demandeth his promi&s;ed hire. They denie it him. Well, in a great rage he departs the citie, and within a yeere after returneth; and &s;ounding the &s;ame bell which before he had v&s;ed to con|iure the mice, he drew after him vnto an hill not farre off, a great number of the citizens children; whither being come, both they and he immediatly va|ni&s;hed. A girle of the company, either for wearine&s;&s;e, or by Gods appointment, &s;tayeth a good di&s;tance behinde: who returning home, and being a&s;|ked what &s;he &s;aw, makes report, that her fellowes were gone vp the hill with the iugler. Then euery man runnes to &s;eeke his childe; but in vaine: for from that time forward they could neuer know what was become of them. Hauing read this, I iudged it either to be a fable, or (as it is in very deed) a mo&s;t wonderfull and &s;trange narration. Di&s;cour&s;ing therefore with certaine citizens of this place, I made mention heereof. They all affirmed it to be true, and &s;ayd, that the yeere, the day, and the number of children that were lo&s;t, was regi&s;tred in the records of the citie of <HI>Hamelen:</HI> and it is yet a cu|&s;tome among them, in their bonds and couenants which they write in an ancient hand, to v&s;e this forme or clau&s;e of &s;peech, <HI>Don on&s;er kinder au&s;gangh,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>From the departure of our children.</HI> And they &s;ay, that the way or &s;treet thorow which they were led, for the perpetuall memorie of their mi&s;|hap, was called by the inhabitants, <HI>Die Bungloe&s;e &s;trae&s;s:</HI> and that it is not lawfull thereto ring a bell. If you haue perhaps read this &s;torie heretofore, I doe now call it to your remembrance. If you know any thing that may &s;tand me in &s;tead, I pray you impart it as lea&s;ure and occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erue.

<P>_OVt of <HI>Pighius</HI> his <HI>Hercules Prodicius</HI> I haue thought good to &s;et downe the originall and de&s;cription of this place: his words be the&s;e: When the barbarous <HI>Hunnes</HI> ouerran a great part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and oppre&s;&s;ed al&s;o the people <HI>Norici</HI> inhabiting <HI>Bauaria,</HI> certaine princi|pall families of them for &s;helter and refuge fled vnto the forre&s;t <HI>Hercynia,</HI> planting them&s;elues in a commodious place by the riuers of <HI>Pegnitz</HI> and <HI>Regnitz;</HI> and &s;o vpon an hill by nature &s;trongly &s;ituate, and free from ho&s;tile incur&s;ions, they built them a rude and homely ca&s;tle, as the Chronicles of <HI>Bauaria</HI> doe beare record. Within a while their number was increa&s;ed by the neighbour-husbandmen and the &s;hepheards of the forre&s;t <HI>Hercynia:</HI> and &s;o of a medley of diuers &s;orts and profe&s;sions of people, they grew at la&s;t to the bigne&s;&s;e of a towne. But giuing them&s;elues to a ba&s;e and di&s;&s;olute kinde of life, without gouernours, without lawes, and continually mole&s;ting the neighbour Pro|uinces with riots and robberies, it &s;eemed good to the German Emperours to &s;end thither a colonie of olde &s;ouldiers, which might &s;erue in &s;tead of a ga|ri&s;on for the place, to bridle their outrages, and to pre&s;cribe vnto them lawes of ciuilitie. Some report, that <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Bauaria</HI> fir&s;t brought it into the forme of a citie, adorned it with the church of <HI>S. Giles,</HI> enacted lawes, and enuironed the ca&s;tle with a larger wall. Al&s;o, that <HI>Conradus</HI> the &s;econd ioined it to the Empire: for at the beginning it was a popular e&s;tate. One onely ciuill di&s;cord in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth, changed it into an <HI>Aristocratia,</HI> or gouernment of a few principall per&s;ons: by which meanes the whole authoritie came into the hands of the Senatours; who euer &s;ince haue v&s;ed &s;uch equitie and moderation in their gouernment, as there hath not at any time in &s;o great a multitude of common people, and diuer&s;itie of nations, growen any notable &s;edition or pernitious mutinie. In the citie there are three degrees of people, that is to &s;ay, Senatours, Merchants, and Artizans. Ancient and honourable families there are 28. out of which alwayes are &s;upplied new Senatours: who all of them are &s;ix and twentie in number. Thirteene of the&s;e, called Burgoma&s;ters, doe con&s;ult of matters of E&s;tate: and the other thirteene they call Scabins, who being alwayes a&s;si&s;ted by three &s;tipendarie lawyers, doe vpon Court and Leet dayes execute iu&s;tice and decide controuer&s;ies among the citizens. It is forbidden by their ancient lawes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">S.W. Her|berts opi|nion con|firmed.</NOTE> that any profe&s;&s;ed lawyer, or any that beares the title of a Doctour, &s;hould be admitted to their &s;enate, or to the gouernment of their Common wealth. Out of either of the &s;aid halfes or thirteenes they chu&s;e euery Lunar moneth or new moone a new Con&s;ull; &s;o that euery yeere the chiefe magi&s;tracie falles by turnes for the &s;pace of a moneth to euery man of both the fore&s;aid thirteenes. Fiue there are of the &s;ame company, that in criminall cau&s;es do make in|quiry, giue &s;entence, and allot puni&s;hment to malefactours. They haue likewi&s;e a Iudge or Pre&s;ident for their &s;uburbs, who executes iu&s;tice among the pe&s;ants and villageois. Out of the &s;ame company al&s;o, they yerely elect two Trea&s;urers, men of &s;ufficient yeeres, credit, and hone&s;ty, who take charge of the cu&s;tomes and reuenues of the whole citie, and haue the receit and disbur&s;ing of the &s;ame. All the &s;aid magi&s;trates, and others that haue any au|thoritie, are cho&s;en only out of the fore&s;aid number of Senatours. Two hundred there are yeerely nominated out of the three E&s;tates and the whole citie, who once a yeere, or vpon any vrgent occa&s;ion, being a&s;&s;embled by the magi&s;trates, do &s;it in common coun&s;ell. The State or company of mer|chants, albeit very great and honourable, are freed notwith&s;tanding from all publike offices, and endowed with mo&s;t ample priuileges: wherefore fol|lowing their priuate traffike, they do in this citie, as in a common ware-hou&s;e, hoord vp the riches not only of <HI>Europe,</HI> but of the mo&s;t remote coun|tries and i&s;lands in the world. The labourers and artizans, which are the la&s;t and meane&s;t degree, are &s;uffered to haue no conuenticles nor meetings priuate or publike in the citie; no &s;olemne banquets nor fe&s;tiuall a&s;&s;emblies of many together, vnle&s;&s;e it be for a matter of religion or &s;ome great fune|rall: for they hold it a thing pernicious to the publike tranquillitie, hauing found by often experience, that mo&s;t dangerous factions and &s;editions haue growen of &s;uch popular meetings, where people in their drunkenne&s;&s;e di&s;pute of the Common-wealth: and that the like tumults haue bereft many ci|ties of their libertie, and brought great calamities vpon them. Now if any quarrell or di&s;&s;ention ari&s;e among the common &s;ort, it is not referred to the Ma&s;ters or Wardens of their crafts and my&s;teries, but to the Senatours them&s;elues; who pre&s;ently appoint two arbitratours, to &s;earch into the cau&s;e, and to do their be&s;t to compound it. If they can not bring it to agreement, then it comes before the Senate; who hauing awarded the matter, do vnder a grieuous penaltie impo&s;e &s;ilence to both parties. With great &s;eueritie they puni&s;h fightings, brawles, iniuries, and priuate quarrels, for the mainte|nance of publike peace: in&s;omuch as a man would thinke, that <HI>Minos</HI> and <HI>Rhadamanthus</HI> gaue dayly &s;entence vpon their iudgement &s;eats. Thus farre <HI>Pighius</HI> concerning the originall, the magi&s;trates, and the common wealth of this citie. More you may reade in the &s;ame authour. The territories ad|iacent being naturally barren and &s;andie are by the indu&s;trie of the people made fruitfull. In the &s;ame territorie &s;tands <HI>Altorff,</HI> where not many yeeres &s;ince the States of <HI>Nurenburg</HI> in&s;tituted an Vniuer&s;itie. <HI>Nurenburg</HI> is watered by the riuer <HI>Pegnitz,</HI> which it cro&s;&s;eth with many &s;tone-bridges. In com|pa&s;&s;e it containeth eight miles. It is compa&s;&s;ed with a double wall, whereon are 183. turrets, be&s;ides ca&s;tles and fortre&s;&s;es. Concerning the originall, &s;i|tuation, maners and cu&s;tomes of this citie, you haue a notable di&s;cour&s;e written by <HI>Conradus Celtis</HI> a Poet laureat.</P>

<HEAD>FRANKENLANDT.</HEAD>
<P>_FRANKENLANDT is partly plaine, and partly mountainous: the mountaines are not very &s;teepe, nor the plaines very fruitfull; be|ing for the mo&s;t part &s;andy. In many places the hilles be &s;et with vines, do yeeld plea&s;ant and delicate wine; e&s;pecially about <HI>Wirtz|burg.</HI> There are great &s;tore of woods, and much hunting. The country is &s;ubiect to many gouernours: notwith&s;tanding they call the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Wirtzburg</HI> Duke of <HI>Frankenlandt.</HI> The Bi&s;hops of <HI>Mentz</HI> and of <HI>Bam|berg</HI> haue many places here. And the Count Palatine enioyeth a great part. Here the Marque&s;es Orantes are &s;eated. And here are many imperiall cities al&s;o.</P>
<P>As touching <HI>Norimberg,</HI> it is doubtfull whether it belongs to <HI>Frankenland</HI> or <HI>Ba|uaria:</HI> by the name, <HI>Bauaria</HI> &s;hould &s;eeme to chalenge it. For <HI>Norimberg</HI> is as much to &s;ay, as <HI>Mons Noricus,</HI> The Norick hill: whereby it appeareth, that it was the city of the <HI>Norici.</HI> And after the <HI>Norici</HI> &s;ucceeded the <HI>Boiari</HI> or Bauarians: and now that portion of countrey that lies betweene <HI>Danubius</HI> and <HI>Norimberg,</HI> is called <HI>No|ricum.</HI> Howbeit the city is in the dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Bamberg,</HI> which belongeth to <HI>Franken|landt.</HI> The inhabitants of <HI>Norimberg</HI> will be accounted neither Bauarians nor Frankes; but a nation differing from both. It is a &s;tately city, with churches, ca&s;tles, and hou&s;es, mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;ly built. It &s;tands vpon the riuer <HI>Pegnitz,</HI> in a barren and &s;andy place, which increa&s;eth the peoples indu&s;try: for they are all either arti|zans or merchants: &s;o that they are exceeding rich, and beare a great name in <HI>Ger|many.</HI> It is a place mo&s;t fit for the Emperours court, a free city, and &s;eated almo&s;t in the mid&s;t of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Betweene <HI>Bamberg</HI> and <HI>Norimberg</HI> lies <HI>Forchaim,</HI> a towne famous for &s;now-white bread. The inhabitants &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Pilate</HI> was here borne. Thus farre <HI>Aeneas Sil|uius</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Europe.</HI> Reade al&s;o <HI>Iohannes Aubanus, Hermannus Comes Nuenarius, Tritthemius</HI> the Abbat, and <HI>Iohn Auentinus,</HI> who thinks that the princi|pall city thereof <HI>Wirtzburg</HI> was of old called <HI>Poeonia.</HI></P>

<P>_OF this Bi&s;hopricke thus writeth <HI>Seba&s;tian Munster</HI> in his Co&s;mogra|phy. <HI>Charlemaine</HI> erected a third Bi&s;hopricke in the mid&s;t of <HI>Saxonie,</HI> now <HI>Westphalia,</HI> in <HI>Myningrode,</HI> a place which afterward in regard of a famous Mona&s;tery there founded, was called <HI>Munster;</HI> and there he ordained as Bi&s;hop one <HI>Ludgerus</HI> borne in <HI>Fri&s;land.</HI> Who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;our <HI>Hermannus</HI> con&s;ecrated the Mona&s;tery and Church on the other &s;ide the water, to the honour of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary.</HI> Which Mona&s;tery in &s;hort time &s;o migh|tily increa&s;ed, and became &s;o famous, that it gaue name both to the City and Bi|&s;hopricke; &s;o that the old name of <HI>Myningrode</HI> being aboli&s;hed by little and little, it began to be called the City and Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Munster,</HI> which name remaines euen till this pre&s;ent day.

<HEAD>BOHEMIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_IOannes Dubrauius</HI> in his Bohemian &s;tory de&s;cribeth this region in maner following. <HI>Bohemia</HI> is &s;itu|ate in <HI>Germanie.</HI> Ea&s;t it extendeth to <HI>Morauia</HI> and <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> and we&s;t to <HI>Bauaria. Au&s;tria</HI> bordereth to the South, as <HI>Saxonie</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;nia</HI> do Northward. It is in forme of a <HI>Theater</HI> enuironed around by the fore&s;t or woods of <HI>Hercynia.</HI> Wherefore there is no great difference between the length and the bredth, containing not much aboue 200. miles a piece. <HI>Charles</HI> king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> who afterward was Empe|rour, diuided it into 12. regions, of which one only he named after the riuer <HI>Vultaw</HI> that runneth through <HI>Prage:</HI> the other eleuen he called by the names of their principall townes; &s;ome of them being &s;o har&s;h of pronunciation, that a man &s;hall hardly &s;peake them, vnle&s;&s;e he be a Bohemian borne or very skilfull in the language. The chiefe Bohemian townes lying towards <HI>Morauia</HI> are <HI>Mutha, Chrudima, Konignigretz, Pardubitz, Litomitz.</HI> Towards <HI>Bauaria</HI> you haue <HI>Glatow, Domazlitz, Mi&s;a</HI> and <HI>Tachow.</HI> On the &s;ide towards <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> the principall towne is <HI>Buduitz,</HI> with <HI>Cromlawe, Trebon, Hradeck:</HI> as likewi&s;e on the <HI>Mi&s;nian</HI> &s;ide &s;tand <HI>Pons, Cadana, Chomutawe, Au&s;tia:</HI> and on the Sile&s;ian quarter <HI>Iaromir, Glacitz, Curia,</HI> and &s;ome others. In the heart of the countrey the principall townes of note are <HI>Cuttenberg, Kolim, Pel&s;in, Veron, Zateckz, Launa, Slana, Lytomerick,</HI> and <HI>Tabor.</HI> But the head citie of all is <HI>Prage,</HI> being &s;o great, as it containeth three faire cities within it, namely, the new, the old, and the little towne, which is di&s;ioyned from the two former by the riuer <HI>Vultaw.</HI> Their Buildings both Publique and priuat are &s;tately and magnificall. This city hath two ca&s;tles; one called <HI>Vi&s;&s;egard,</HI> whilom the Kings palace, but now wa&s;te and almo&s;t de&s;o|late, by meanes of ciuile warres. Again that other ca&s;tle that ouer looketh the little towne, as it is named, &s;o it well de&s;erueth the title of the Royal or princely ca&s;tle. For it re&s;embleth rather a city then a Ca&s;tle; filling vp &s;o great a roome with the wals and buildings. Of publique edifices, the Church built by King <HI>Charles</HI> before mentioned; and the Ca&s;tle erected by K. <HI>Vladi&s;laus,</HI> late decea&s;ed, are the mo&s;t memorable. And as <HI>Prage</HI> of all their Cities hath the preeminence; &s;o hath <HI>Elbe</HI> (called by Tacitus re|nowmed and famous) of all their riuers. Howbeit concerning the fountaine of this riuer Tacitus writeth skarce &s;oundly, namely that it &s;pringeth in the region of the <HI>Hermonduri.</HI> For it ari&s;eth not among the <HI>Hermonduri,</HI> but rather out of certaine Bohemian mountaines lying open to the North, vpon the frontiers of <HI>Morauia,</HI> which the ancient Bohemians call <HI>Cercone&s;si.</HI> From which mountaines this riuer refre&s;heth and watereth the greater and better part of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> and then hauing augmented his &s;treames by the influence of <HI>Vultawa, Egra, Satzawa, Gitzera,</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;a</HI> his neighbour-riuers, continueth his cour&s;e and name through <HI>Mi&s;nia</HI> and <HI>Saxonie</HI> to the maine Ocean, being all that way enriched with abundance of Salmons. But the &s;maller riuers and fre&s;hets of <HI>Bohemia</HI> yeeld in &s;ome places graines of gold, and in others &s;hell-fi&s;hes containing pearle. Heere al&s;o you haue certaine hot bathes both plea&s;ant and medicinable. And all the whole countrie &s;o aboundeth with graine, as it affoordeth plenty to the neigh|bour-regions. Wines there are no great &s;tore: and tho&s;e of the countrey &s;o weake, as they la&s;t but a very &s;mall time. Howbeit they haue &s;affron of the be&s;t, excelling both in colour, &s;mell, and moi&s;ture, three principall properties to chu&s;e that commoditie by. There are &s;iluer-mines &s;o exceeding rich, that were it not for &s;ome &s;mall quantitie of flint that in&s;inuates it &s;elfe into the veine, you &s;hould haue nothing but perfect &s;iluer: whereas in other countries tho&s;e mines are e&s;teemed of high price, that hold a quarter or a fift part, or at the vtmo&s;t one halfe of good &s;iluer. They find al&s;o plenty of gold-ore in certaine mines which take their name of a place called <HI>Giloua.</HI> It is reported that the Kings of <HI>Bohemia</HI> haue had graines of pure gold brought from thence weighing tenne pound a piece. Neither are they de&s;titute of ba&s;er metall: namely, tinne, lead, copper, and yron. And &s;ome|times they finde in tho&s;e mineral rockes, the carbuncle, the Saphyre, and the Amethi&s;t. Next vnto their mines there is nothing of greater account to the Bohemians then their waters repleni&s;hed with carps: which I haue declared more at large in a peculiar booke treating of fi&s;h-pondes. Now let vs decypher the di&s;po&s;ition of the inhabitants. In briefe therefore, both in maners, habit, and &s;tature of body the Bohemians re&s;emble the Lion king of bea&s;ts, vnder who&s;e con&s;tillation they are &s;ubiect; that is to &s;ay, if you con&s;ider either the largene&s;&s;e of their limbs, their broad and mightie brea&s;tes, their yellow &s;hag-haire hanging ouer their &s;houlders, the har&s;hne&s;&s;e of their voice, their &s;parkling eies, or their exceeding &s;trength and courage. The Lion carries a kind of contempt and di&s;dainefull pride ouer other bea&s;tes, and hardly &s;hall you vanqui&s;h him, if you a&s;&s;aile him by force. Neither doth the Bohemian in this re&s;pect degenerate but &s;oone &s;hewes his contempt towards other nations both in word and deed, and di&s;|couers his arrogancie both in his gate, ge&s;ture, and pompe. Being &s;et light by, he growes impatient; in any enterprize he is as bold as a Lion, and mo&s;t firme and con&s;tant till he hath brought it to execution, but not without a touch of ambition and vaine glory. Moreouer like a lion he is greedie of his meat, and very curious in the dre&s;&s;ing and &s;ea&s;oning thereof. And their neigh|bours the <HI>Saxons</HI> haue taught them to carou&s;e both day and night. And by rea&s;on of their neighbourhood the Bohemians differ not much from the Germans in other qualities. Hitherto <HI>Dubrauius,</HI> by whom al&s;o the originall and ancient dwelling place of this nation is de&s;cribed. They brew excellent ale in this countrey, calling it Whiteale. They &s;peake the Sclauon tongue, calling them&s;elues <HI>Czecks,</HI> and the Germans <HI>Niemecks.</HI> Vnder the &s;tile of this kingdome are al&s;o comprized the regions of <HI>Morauia, Sile&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;atia.</HI> Likewi&s;e in the yeare 1315. the city <HI>Egra</HI> became the warehou&s;e or principall mart towne of the Bohemians. Con|cerning the region it &s;elfe you may read more largely in <HI>Aeneas Siluius;</HI> and of the people, in the fir&s;t booke of <HI>Martinus Cro|merus</HI> his Polonian &s;tory. Vnto the&s;e you may adde <HI>Mun&s;ter, Rithaimer, Crantzius</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Wandalia,</HI> and <HI>Sabellicus En.</HI> 10. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Panthaleon Candidus</HI> wrote of late &s;euen books entitled <HI>Bohemaidos. Prage</HI> the head citie of this Kindome, is peculi|arly de&s;cribed by <HI>Georgius Hand&s;chius.</HI> The Map it &s;elfe we borowed out of the Table of <HI>Ioannes Crigingerus,</HI> publi&s;hed at <HI>Prage</HI> 1568.</P>
<P>The diuers appellations of certaine cities in this Kingdome we thought good here to put downe out of <HI>Mun&s;ter.</HI> For the names of all their cities, are by the Bohemian pronounced after one maner, and by the German after another.</P>

<HEAD>SILESIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_JOhn Crato</HI> one of the Emperours coun&s;ellers, and his principall Phy&s;ician, hath for the benefit of the &s;tudious in Geography, out of his relations of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> imparted thus much vnto vs.</P>
<P>That we may not be &s;crupulous about the name of the Sile&s;ians, nor (as &s;ome haue done) deriue it from the Ely&s;ian fields: we are out of ancient writers to vnder&s;tand, that the &s;ame region which they now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, was formerly inhabited by the Quadi. For <HI>Quad</HI> in the Saxon or old German tongue, hath the &s;ame &s;ignification that <HI>Siletz</HI> hath in the Polonian or Sclauon. For they were a people that re&s;orted hither out of &s;un|dry places, more addicted to warre than peace, de&s;troyers rather than builders, and im|patient of all &s;uperioritie. The fir&s;t King that bare rule ouer them was <HI>Bole&s;laus</HI> a Po|lacke. He was borne in the yeere of our Lord 967. his mother a Bohemian, neece to Duke <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> by the brothers &s;ide. A &s;onne of his called <HI>Mie&s;laus,</HI> in the yeere 1001. was married to <HI>Rixa</HI> daughter of <HI>Erenfrid</HI> County Palantine, neece to the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the third, by his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Melchitis:</HI> and this man was the fir&s;t that receiued the kingly diademe from <HI>Otho</HI> the third. But after his decea&s;e the Polonians hauing by &s;edition expelled out of their kingdome the Emperours niece and his &s;onne <HI>Ca&s;imire, Conradus</HI> the Emperour re&s;eruing to him&s;elfe a certaine tribute, annexed <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> to the crowne of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> This Emperour was an Vrati&s;lauian borne, and perhaps gaue the name of <HI>Vrati&s;lauia</HI> to his natiue citie, which is now commonly called <HI>Bre&s;law.</HI> But hereof I cannot certainly affirme ought. This one thing is not to be doubted, that the Sile&s;ians had no affection towards the Polonians, whenas by the practi&s;e and indu&s;try of <HI>Iohn</HI> the fir&s;t king of <HI>Bohemia</HI> father to the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fourth, they vnited them&s;elues to the Bohemians. Some there are (by what authority or opinion I know not) which affirme that in the &s;ame place where <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> now &s;tands, was built in times pa&s;t by a Prince called <HI>Liguis,</HI> the city of <HI>Budurgis</HI> mentioned in <HI>Ptolemey.</HI> For it is apparent out of hi&s;tories, that <HI>Mie&s;laus</HI> Duke of <HI>Poland,</HI> who was fir&s;t created King by the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the third, and in the yeere 965. embraced Chri&s;tianitie, did <HI>anno</HI> 1048. erect a woodden church or chapel to the honour of <HI>S. Iohn Bapti&s;t.</HI> Whereby you may gather, that in tho&s;e dayes there was no great matter of building at <HI>Bre&s;law.</HI> Moreouer, <HI>Gotefridus</HI> the fir&s;t Prelate of that church being an Italian, preferred the village of <HI>Smogra</HI> before the citie of <HI>Bre&s;law,</HI> hauing there his Schole and College. Likewi&s;e about this time it is thought that the foundations of other the principall cities of <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> namely of <HI>Lignitz, Glogaw, Lu|ben,</HI> &amp;c. were layd: for out of monuments and Annales no certainty can be gathered, whenas the anciente&s;t wri|tings in all <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> are the letters of the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the &s;econd, which were written in the yeere 1200. all the re&s;idue being con&s;umed and lo&s;t, either by fires or inua&s;ions which haue beene very terrible in the&s;e parts. But by the good indeuour of <HI>Frederick Barbaro&s;&s;a, Sile&s;ia</HI> was both pacified, and &s;o di&s;tributed among the &s;onnes of <HI>Vladi&s;laus</HI> king of <HI>Poland,</HI> that it &s;eemed not altogether to be di&s;membred from that crowne. But when the Poloni|ans perceiued that <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> grew full of Germans, and that the Princes began to fauour them; reiecting the lawfull heires, they aduanced to the kingdome of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> one <HI>Vladi&s;laus Locticus,</HI> a cruell enemy to the Germans. This was the occa&s;ion that they betooke them&s;elues to the protection of <HI>Iohn</HI> king of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> who being &s;onne to the Em|perour <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;euenth, married the daughter of <HI>Wence&s;laus</HI> king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and was inue&s;ted into the king|dome 1302. Wherefore after the decea&s;e of this <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Lucelberg, Sile&s;ia</HI> was &s;ubiect to twelue Bohemian kings one after another, &s;ix whereof were Emperours, one a Bohemian, another an Hungarian, fiue of the hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> two Polacks, but de&s;cended from <HI>Austria</HI> by the mothers &s;ide. Of the Polonian race remained as yet in <HI>Si|le&s;ia</HI> the Princes of <HI>Lignitz</HI> and <HI>Te&s;chnitz:</HI> for tho&s;e of <HI>Mun&s;terberg</HI> deriue their pedegree from <HI>George</HI> king of <HI>Bo|hemia. Vrati&s;lauia</HI> the head-city of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> being burnt to a&s;hes in the yere 1341, began then &s;o &s;tately to be built of &s;tone, as at this pre&s;ent both for order and beauty of hou&s;es and largene&s;&s;e of &s;treets, it is little inferiour to any of the cities in <HI>Germanie.</HI> Concerning other more true ornaments of a Common-wealth, I &s;hall not need to &s;peake, &s;eeing it is manife&s;t to all <HI>Germanie,</HI> that &s;car&s;e in any other region there are to be found &s;o many Schooles, &s;uch numbers of learned Profe&s;&s;ours, and of excellent wits. It be&s;eemes me not to &s;peake too gloriou&s;ly of my coun|treymen; yet thus much I may boldly &s;ay, that there is almo&s;t no Princes court, nor any famous common-wealth, where the vertue and learning of the Sile&s;ians findes not entertainment. The gentlemen likewi&s;e albeit addicted to tillage and good husbandry, yet are they &s;o warlike withall, that no indifferent Iudges can deny, but that by their valour the remainder of <HI>Hungarie</HI> is defended. It is a region very fruitfull of corne, e&s;pecially in one place aboue the re&s;t, which is mo&s;t carefully manured by our people. It aboundeth with fi&s;h-pooles. The famous riuer <HI>Odera</HI> confineth it Ea&s;t and North, and South it is diuided from <HI>Bohemia</HI> by <HI>Sudetes.</HI> But the &s;ituation be&s;t appeareth in the Map. Of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> you haue &s;omewhat written by <HI>Aeneas Syluius,</HI> and by others which are ignorant of the coun|trey. But <HI>Laurentius Coruinus</HI> could haue brought more certainties to light, had not the age wherein he liued been fatally ouerwhelmed in ignorance. Thus much <HI>Iohn Crato</HI> concerning his natiue countrey <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI> It containeth twelue Dukedomes; one Bi&s;hoprick, the Bi&s;hop whereof hath his re&s;idence at <HI>Nei&s;&s;e,</HI> and &s;ometimes at <HI>Bre&s;law:</HI> for there is a Cathedrall church and a College of Canons. Heere are foure Baronies al&s;o. In this region about <HI>Striga</HI> and <HI>Lignitz</HI> is found a kinde of medicinable earth, commonly called <HI>Terra &s;igillata,</HI> like that of <HI>Lemnus,</HI> and of equall force; &s;ome quantitie whereof <HI>Iacobus Manouius</HI> Citizen and Senatour of <HI>Bre&s;law</HI> hath often be&s;towed vpon me.</P>
<P>The Chronicles of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> were of late written by <HI>Ioachimus Curius,</HI> wherein he hath &s;o curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed the &s;ituation and the antiquity of their townes and cities, the gouernment of their &s;tate, and their memorable acts, that the &s;tudious may here finde an ab&s;olute hi&s;tory.

<HEAD>MORAVIA.</HEAD>
<P>_MORAVIA is thus de&s;cribed by <HI>Ioannes Dubrauius</HI> in his Bohemian &s;tory: <HI>Morauia</HI> was called of olde <HI>Marcomania,</HI> becau&s;e it confined vpon <HI>Germany</HI> at that place, where <HI>Dariubius</HI> en|treth <HI>Hungary.</HI> For <HI>Mark</HI> in high Dutch &s;ignifies a limit or confine, and thereupon <HI>Marco|manni</HI> are &s;uch as inhabit the borders of a countrey. Concerning the&s;e people <HI>Arrianus</HI> in his relation of <HI>Germany,</HI> the farthe&s;t of the&s;e nations (&s;aith he) are the <HI>Quadi</HI> and <HI>Marcomanni,</HI> then the Iazyges a people of <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> after the Getes, and la&s;tly a great part of the Sarma|tians. Howbeit, at this pre&s;ent, becau&s;e it is bounded by the riuer <HI>Mora,</HI> from the &s;ame riuer the inhabitants are called <HI>Moraui,</HI> and the countrey <HI>Morauia.</HI> On three &s;ides, as it now &s;tands, it is diuided by mountaines, woods, fore&s;ts, or riuers; on the Ea&s;t from <HI>Hungary,</HI> We&s;t from <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and North from <HI>Sile&s;ia:</HI> for on the South part towards <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> it is plaine, being &s;ome where &s;eparated therefrom by the riuer <HI>Thay&s;a,</HI> and in other places by another ob&s;cure riuer. The principall riuer in <HI>Morauia</HI> is <HI>Mora,</HI> which en|uironeth the chiefe city called <HI>Olmuntz,</HI> and from thence running into <HI>Hungary,</HI> di&s;chargeth him&s;elfe with his tributary &s;treames into the chanell of <HI>Danubius.</HI> For <HI>Mora</HI> receiuing into his bo&s;ome the riuer <HI>Nigra;</HI> and that of <HI>Switta,</HI> whereon &s;tandeth the city <HI>Brin</HI> next in dignity to <HI>Olmuntz;</HI> al&s;o <HI>Thay&s;a,</HI> which glideth along by the city <HI>Znaim</HI> famous for the death of <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> the Emperour; and la&s;tly <HI>Igla</HI> pa&s;sing by the city <HI>Igla;</HI> rendreth vp his owne and his neighbours &s;ub&s;tance to the great and renowmed <HI>Danubius.</HI> But the riuer <HI>Odera</HI> &s;pringing not far from <HI>Olmuntz,</HI> retaineth his name to the Ocean &s;ea. Some thinke it is called by <HI>Ptolemey Viadrus. Odera</HI> is &s;o na|med of a word borrowed from fowlers, which call their watch-towers for the &s;pying and taking of birds, <HI>Odri;</HI> and &s;uch towers you haue now in <HI>Morauia</HI> at the fountaine of <HI>Odera.</HI> Neither mu&s;t we heere omit the riuer <HI>Hana,</HI> which albeit &s;ometimes &s;cant of water, yet doth it &s;o moi&s;ten the neighbour-fields, being thereby the fer|tile&s;t in all the region, as the husbandmen in regard of their plentifull increa&s;e, call them the fat of <HI>Morauia.</HI> Here al&s;o more than in other places are found the &s;iluer and gold coines of <HI>M. Antoninus,</HI> of <HI>Commodus,</HI> and other Em|perours. Which is a manife&s;t argument of ancient warres betweene the forces of the Empire and the Marco|mans in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>This one thing is mo&s;t worthy the admiration, that in <HI>Morauia</HI> there is a kind of Frankincen&s;e &amp; Myrrhe, not di&s;tilling out of trees as in other countries, but digged from vnder the ground, in one place only called <HI>Gradi&s;co,</HI> where till this pre&s;ent is found not only Frankincen&s;e called Male frankincen&s;e in regard of the re&s;emblance it hath with the priuie parts of man; but al&s;o in the &s;hape of other members both of man and woman. And of late <HI>VVence&s;laus</HI> of the noble family &s;urnamed <HI>&agrave; Quercu,</HI> as he was making a foundation for the banke of a fi&s;h-poole in his field of <HI>Sterenberg,</HI> he found the intire body of a man, con&s;i&s;ting all of Myrrhe, the which di&s;tributing vnto his friends, and remembring me among the re&s;t, be&s;towed on me more than halfe an arme, which I v&s;ed often for a perfume.</P>
<P>The inner part of the region is arable, an exceeding fertile and fat &s;oile, and mo&s;t apt for corne: as the hilles for vines, being more fauourable to <HI>Bacchus</HI> than the hilles of <HI>Bohemia;</HI> wherefore it excelleth for abundance of good wine. And it is &s;o generally manured, and hath &s;uch plentie of husbandmen, that vnle&s;&s;e it be in fore&s;ts and de&s;ert places, heere is no pa&s;ture at all for the feeding of cattell. For the re&s;t, both in &s;peech, fa&s;hions and cu&s;tomes, they are like the Bohemians. Hitherto <HI>Dubrauius.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeere 895. the people of this region were in&s;tructed in the Chri&s;tian faith by <HI>S. Methodius,</HI> at the pro|curement of <HI>Arnulphus</HI> the Emperour. Vnder the Emperour <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the yeere 1086. this countrey, together with <HI>Lu&s;atia</HI> and <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> was annexed to the kingdome of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> Their language is mixt, for the grea|te&s;t part &s;peake Bohemian, and the high Dutch is v&s;ed only in cities among per&s;ons of be&s;t account. This Pro|uince (as <HI>Dubrauius</HI> writeth) yeelds plentie of wine, but not of the &s;tronge&s;t; &s;uch (&s;aith <HI>Rithaimerus,</HI> and I my &s;elfe haue &s;o found it by experience) as exempteth not the drinker quite from care. <HI>Duglo&s;&s;us</HI> in his Polonian &s;to|rie &s;aith that the name of the riuer <HI>Odera</HI> &s;ignifies in the Henetian tongue, inundation or robbery. <HI>Olmuntz</HI> the head citie of this region, and the &s;eat of a Bi&s;hop, is de&s;cribed by <HI>Stephanus Taurinus</HI> in his <HI>Stauromachia.</HI> Concer|ning <HI>Morauia,</HI> be&s;ides <HI>Dubrauius,</HI> reade <HI>Aeneas Siluius</HI> in his Bohemian &s;tory.</P>
<P>This Map of <HI>Morauia</HI> fir&s;t drawen by <HI>Fabricius,</HI> but afterward corrected by diuers gentlemen of the countrey was &s;ent me by <HI>Iohn Crato</HI> Coun&s;eller and principall Phy&s;ician to the Emperour <HI>Maximilian</HI> the &s;econd a bounti|full fauourer of the&s;e my &s;tudies.

<P>The &s;oile is good and fertile of all maner of corne, and is &s;uch as is manured and tilled with &s;mall charge.

<P>Of the originall and rea&s;on of the etymologie of the name of this countrey, this report <HI>Lazius</HI> in his Commentaries of <HI>VVien</HI> doth giue.

<P>This region long &s;ince was fir&s;t gouerned by Marque&s;&s;es, then by Dukes; and la&s;tly by Archdukes; to whom it is now &s;ubiect: as is more at large to be &s;eene in the &s;aid Commentaries of <HI>Lazius.</HI> The an|cient armes of this countrey were fiue Larkes Ore, in a field Azure: but <HI>Lupold</HI> the Marque&s;&s;e, the fift of that name, of an accident or euent that befell him, was licenced by the Emperour to alter his coat, and to beare a field Gules with a fe&s;&s;e argent: for that in the &s;iege and a&s;&s;ault of <HI>Accon</HI> he was all ouer em|brued with bloud, onely his girdle excepted.

The Fennes yeeld pa&s;tures; the Mountaines hawking and hunting. But this citie hauing long &s;ince flouri&s;hed for a few yeres, in the time of <HI>Attila</HI> the King of the Hunnes, &s;u&s;teined many inrodes and incur&s;ions, and was mi&s;erably wa&s;ted with fire and &s;word. Afterward about the yeere of Chri&s;t 520, whenas <HI>S.

Peter.</HI> Al&s;o by the bountifull magnifi|cence of the &s;ame Duke, he erected a Mona&s;terie of the order of <HI>S. Bennet,</HI> and gouerned the Bi|&s;hops &s;ea foure and fortie yeeres &amp;c.

This is combred with many mari|&s;hes, huge lakes, &s;wift &s;treames, darke and fearefull woods. Be&s;ides beares, bores, and &s;uch like wild bea&s;ts, it hath many heards of &s;tags of an hundred yeeres old, which no man may hunt without the Princes leaue, but vnder a great penaltie. It is a good &s;oile for pa&s;torage, and for the feeding of cat|tell. It yeeldeth yeerely great plentie of Apples, Barley, Oats, and &s;uch like corne, although not of all &s;orts: it is inhabited but here and there. The cities of this countrey are <HI>Munchen</HI> vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>I&s;ara,</HI> a mo&s;t goodly and famous citie, and the Dukes &s;eat. This citie continually main|teineth Lions.

<P>_THe other part of <HI>Bayern</HI> which is on the other &s;ide <HI>Donaw,</HI> and runneth out be|yond the Bohemian wood, is called in our time (and long &s;ince was) <HI>Nortgoia,</HI> ha|uing <HI>Noremberg</HI> for the chiefe citie, from whence the country, as &s;ome men thinke, tooke his name. And although that <HI>Noremberg</HI> be no ancient citie, yet his ca&s;tle, &s;ituate vpon the toppe of an hill, is very ancient. This region hath many townes, mona&s;teries and villages, e&s;pecially <HI>Amberg,</HI> which in the yeere of Chri&s;t 1300. was enclo&s;ed with a wall. <HI>Awerbach, Sultzpach, Ca&s;tell Mun&s;ter,</HI> (where in old time the Princes of <HI>Nortgoia</HI> haue held their Court) <HI>Eger, Beierut, Eister, Napurg, Newen&s;tadt, Rewenkelm, Kemnat, Kru&s;en, Greuenwerdt, E&s;chenbach, VVeiden, Pernaw, Plei&s;tein, Her&s;pruck, Rurbach, Neumarckt, Tur&s;enrut, Elbogen, Cham, Schon&s;ee, Kun&s;perg, Stauff, &amp;c.</HI> Which for the mo&s;t part do belong vnto the Pala|tine Princes. For <HI>Lewis</HI> the Emperour and Duke of <HI>Bayern,</HI> in the yeere of CHRIST 1339. made &s;uch a diui&s;ion, that of the whole prouince of <HI>Bayern,</HI> the prouince of <HI>Nortgoia</HI> &s;hould be &s;ubiect vnto the Pala|tine Princes, except only certaine townes which &s;hould belong to the Emperour: and many al&s;o that did appertaine to the crowne of the Empire, in time pa&s;t haue beene pawned to the Princes of <HI>Bayern.</HI></P>
<P>In this Prouince, betweene <HI>Bamberg</HI> and <HI>Neremberg,</HI> in the Ea&s;t, toward the towne <HI>Eger,</HI> there is a great mountaine called <HI>Fichtelberg,</HI> out of which do i&s;&s;ue foure riuers, <HI>Meane, Nabe, Sala</HI> and <HI>Eger.</HI> This moun|taine conteineth in compa&s;&s;e about &s;ix miles, it bringeth forth diuers kinds of mettals: it yeeldeth the be&s;t blew colour, which commonly they call Azure. In the toppe of the mountaine there is al&s;o found Tinne, and many caues, out of the which in former times mettals haue beene digged: generally all that whole prouince euery where &s;welleth with mines, e&s;pecially of iron, by which meanes the Nortgoians do yeerely reape great profit. Otherwi&s;e the &s;oile is hard and rough, although in &s;ome places it doth bring forth good &s;tore of graine, and is excellent pa&s;ture ground. This Prouince of <HI>Nortgoia</HI> conteineth one of the foure Earledomes or Landtgrauies, which long &s;ince were erected by the Emperors, namely, <HI>Luchtenberg,</HI> which taketh his name of the ca&s;tle <HI>Luchtenberg,</HI> notwith&s;tanding that the Princes of that iu|ri&s;diction doe keepe their Court in the towne of <HI>Freimbd,</HI> and &s;ometime in <HI>Grun&s;felden,</HI> the &s;ituation of which towne thou maye&s;t &s;ee in the Mappe. The Earle which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the place, is called <HI>George,</HI> it I be not deceiued, de&s;cended from his progenitours <HI>Albert</HI> and <HI>Fredericke.</HI> This Earledome hath not growen vnto &s;uch greatne&s;&s;e as the other three, which in proce&s;&s;e of time are much enlarged, both in po&s;&s;e&s;sions and command, and e&s;pecially the Landtgrauie or Earledome of <HI>He&s;&s;en.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Seba|&s;tian Mun&s;ter.</HI> See al&s;o <HI>Pius</HI> the &s;econd.

And therefore the iuri&s;diction of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> can not more fitly take his begginning, than where <HI>Nicher</HI> ari&s;eth, which &s;pringeth from a &s;mall fountaine out of the high hilles of <HI>Arbona</HI> in the Dukedome of <HI>VVirtemberg,</HI> neere vnto the villages <HI>Schwenningen,</HI> in the confines of the towne <HI>Villing,</HI> not much more than fiue hundred pa&s;es from the fountaine of <HI>Donaw.</HI> Not farre from his fountaine it pa&s;&s;eth by <HI>Rotwell,</HI> and leauing vpon the left hand the head of <HI>Blacke-wood,</HI> vpon the right, <HI>Switzerland</HI> Alpes, runneth by the Duchie of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> with a wandering and crooked cour&s;e (&s;o &s;aluting here and there certaine noble mens ca&s;tles, and townes of the Roman Emperours) from his fir&s;t ri&s;e the &s;pace of fiue dayes iourney more or le&s;&s;e, being with diuers little &s;treames from &s;undry places encrea&s;ed and laden, and &s;o made nauigable, at <HI>Heydelberg</HI> falleth very &s;wiftly into the <HI>Rhein.</HI></P>
<P>The whole countrey, by rea&s;on of the nature of the &s;oile, whether for tillage or otherwi&s;e in re&s;pect of the fertility, is not euery where alike. For that part where <HI>Nicher</HI> ari&s;eth, and which bordereth vpon the <HI>Blacke-wood,</HI> as al&s;o that which is abbuttant vpon the Alpes of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> (&s;ituate betweene <HI>Donaw</HI> and <HI>Nicher</HI>) is &s;omewhat rough, vnapt for vines, but yeelding indifferent good pa&s;ture for cattell. The &s;oile within the Alps is &s;tony, yet very good for corne: in like maner by the &s;ides of <HI>Blacke-wood,</HI> the land is &s;andy of a red colour, which notwith|&s;tanding is rea&s;onable good corne ground. Euery where the nation is much giuen to breed and bring vp cattell. Nere vnto the fore&s;t of <HI>Blacke-wood</HI> there are recorded to be the&s;e Lord&s;hips, &s;ubiect vnto the Duchy of <HI>VVirtem|berg: Hornberg, Schultach, Dorn&s;tad, Nagold, VVildberg, Kalbe, VVilde bath, Newen&s;tade.</HI> By the Alps, or neere vnto them, the&s;e Lord&s;hips, <HI>Baling, VVrach, Blawbeyren, Heidenheim, Tuthing</HI> vpon the banke of <HI>Donaw,</HI> by the which, as by a certaine trench, they are &s;euered and diuided. But euery where the confines of the iuri&s;diction of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> do gather them&s;elues into a ring, as it were, enclo&s;ed with a large band, to the places neere to <HI>Nicher.</HI> But where|as <HI>Nicher</HI> doth &s;pread it &s;elfe into the champian fields, there it is not only more kinde for temperature of the aire, but al&s;o the &s;oile is more fit for tillage. Euery where are riuers well &s;tored with fi&s;h, hole&s;ome &s;prings, plea&s;ant lakes, goodly valleys. Euery where hilles be&s;et with Vines, well-gra&s;ing pa&s;tures and medowes, fertile fields, fore&s;ts of woods and groues, in the which are great &s;tore of Beeches, many Okes, innumerable companies of Deeres, large pa&s;tures, abundance of cattell: in all places plenty of Wine, Corne and Apples.</P>
<P>Vpon the brinke of crooked <HI>Nicher,</HI> here and there, are many goodly cities; &s;ome of them of rea&s;onable greatne&s;&s;e, others not &s;o bigge; but for building and beautie very glorious. In the higher countrey, vpon <HI>Ni|cher</HI> doe &s;tand <HI>Hernberg, Tubing, Nurting, Kurch:</HI> then <HI>Stutgard,</HI> which being built as it were in the center of the prouince, is the chiefe citie and the palace of the princes of <HI>VVirtemberg,</HI> and excelleth all the other cities in buil|dings, multitude of people and greatne&s;&s;e. About the lower coa&s;t of <HI>Nicher</HI> at this day doe flouri&s;h <HI>VVabling, Schrondorff, VVinida, Bachanauge, Brackenauge, Binnicke, Be&s;sicke, Bieticke, VVinsberg, Megimill, Lauff, Greining, VVahing.</HI> Next vnto <HI>Statgard</HI> are <HI>Bebeling, Lenberg, Canno&s;tade:</HI> all which cities haue their &s;euerall Lord&s;hips, many &s;trong villages, men and munition. Moreouer, generally the people of this countrey is for their manhood, humanitie, con&s;tancie and religion very renowmed. The townes (as I &s;aid before) are not &s;o great, but are &s;umptuou&s;ly built; whereof &s;ome are &s;ufficiently fortified by nature and benefit of the place; other &s;ome by the indu&s;trie and labour of man. The villages are &s;o well inhabited, that they are not much inferiour to prety townes: their hou&s;es are of timber, but very artificially built. The ca&s;tles are fortified by nature and &s;ituation, as al&s;o by the ingenious arte of fortification, and &s;o are not ea&s;ie to be &s;urpri&s;ed: &s;o that a man would thinke that another <HI>La|conia</HI> were yet extant among&s;t the Switzers; &s;uch is the excellencie of the men both at home and abroad.</P>
<P>This Dukedome hath his name of <HI>VVirtemberg</HI> an ancient beacon, which now is &s;ituate in the mid&s;t of his ter|ritory, not very farre from <HI>Stutgard,</HI> yet vpon &s;omewhat a ri&s;ing ground &amp; hilly place, is neither for his &s;trength nor building any terrour to the enemy. But according to the cu&s;tome of their ance&s;tours, who tru&s;ted rather to their &s;words of &s;teele, than walles of &s;tone, it was notable for the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of the place, only commendable now for his antiquitie, hauing a mo&s;t goodly pro&s;pect round about; aboue are the woods of Beech, beneath are the fertile hilles of Vines &amp;c. The late Dukes of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> for many ages pa&s;t, held their Court in this tower, taking from thence their name, their &s;tocke, and their armes, as is to euery man very apparent. There are which thinke, that the Dukes of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> haue had their of&s;pring from the Tu&s;cans or Rhaetians: others from the French. Whether of the&s;e opinions are more probable, I much regard not, for in a thing altogether vncertaine I affirme nothing con&s;tantly. It is certaine that they were &s;trangers: whether they came fir&s;t forth of <HI>Italie</HI> or from <HI>France,</HI> that as yet is not certainly knowen, &amp;c. Thus farre <HI>Iohn Pede.</HI></P>

<P>_THey which diuided the Empire of <HI>Germany</HI> into certeine Bands or Circles (<HI>Kreis</HI> they com|monly call them) they made <HI>Switzerland</HI> the fourth in order, now in all they record tenne: it is certaine, as approued hi&s;tories do mention, that at fir&s;t <HI>Switzerland</HI> was a Kingdome, but afterward reduced vnto a Dukedome. Notwith&s;tanding at this day there is none of the Princes of <HI>Germanie</HI> which is graced with the title of Duke of <HI>Switzerland:</HI> for it is now diuided among&s;t many Princes. One part hath accrued by lot of inheritance vnto the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;trich:</HI> the duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> enioyeth the greate&s;t part: in it there are many free cities, and &s;uch as do belong vnto the crowne of the Empire: many are &s;ubiect vnto the Duke of <HI>Bauiere.</HI> There is none of the old writers which doth not make report of this Nation, as of the mo&s;t noble and anciente&s;t of all <HI>Germany.</HI> It is cleere out of <HI>Ptolemey, Strabo,</HI> and other authours, that heretofore they were &s;eated vpon the riuer <HI>Sweue</HI> and <HI>Albis.</HI> But now at this day it is the vtmo&s;t prouince of all <HI>Germany,</HI> for it ab|butteth vpon the Alpes. It is bounded by <HI>Bayern, Frankenland</HI> and <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> or <HI>El&s;as,</HI> on euery &s;ide round about. In olde time this countrey was called <HI>Alemanie,</HI> of the lake <HI>Lemanus</HI> (vulgarly now called <HI>Lac de Lo&s;anne</HI> or <HI>Lac de Ge|neue,</HI> the Germans call it, <HI>Ienfferlee</HI>) as &s;ome thinke.</P>
<P>The countrey, as <HI>Iohn Auban</HI> in that worthy worke of his, <HI>De moribus gentium,</HI> de&s;cribeth it, is partly champian, partly hilly. The &s;oile is fruitfull, of which there is no part which lieth vntilled, excepting that which Lakes, Mountaines or Woods do po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e. In it are many woods; and therefore the nation is giuen much to hunting and hawking: they haue abundance of corne, and great &s;tore of cattell. The whole prouince by rea&s;on of the hol&s;omne&s;&s;e of the aire is euery where repleni&s;hed with goodly cities, villages, ca&s;tles and bulwarks &s;trongly fortified a&s;well by nature as arte. About the mountaines it yeeldeth iron, &s;iluer, and other mettals. The nation is populous, &s;tout, audacious, and warlike: and therefore <HI>Plutarch</HI> calleth it, The mo&s;t excellent nation of all the Germans. Who&s;e renowme is recorded to be &s;uch and &s;o to be enlarged, that for valour and feats of armes it &s;eemeth to haue de&s;erued the Empire of the whole world: which indeed it hath mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly for the &s;pace of &s;omewhat more than an hundred yeeres enioyed. Thus farre out of <HI>Iohn Auban,</HI> where thou maye&s;t at large &s;ee the cu&s;tomes and maner of life of this nation.</P>
<P><HI>Augusta Vindelicorum, Augspurg</HI> vpon the riuer <HI>Lech,</HI> and <HI>Vlm</HI> vpon <HI>Donaw,</HI> are the mo&s;t famous cities of this pro|uince at this day. There are al&s;o <HI>Campodun, Memmingen, Werd, Nordling,</HI> and others, of which thou maye&s;t reade in <HI>Munster. Donaw,</HI> the greate&s;t riuer of all <HI>Europe,</HI> here taketh his beginning, and pa&s;&s;eth thorow the midde&s;t of the countrey. This riuer, laden with three&s;core &s;treames (which <HI>Cu&s;pinian,</HI> according to the report of <HI>Collimitius,</HI> de&s;cribeth by name and order) emptieth it &s;elfe into <HI>Pontus Euxinus</HI> (the Greeks now call it, <HI>Maurothala&s;&s;a;</HI> the Ita|lians <HI>Marmaiore;</HI> the Turkes, as <HI>Busbequius</HI> affirmeth, <HI>Cara-denis,</HI> that is, The blacke-&s;ea) by &s;ix huge mouthes.

<P>_THe <HI>Heluetij</HI> (which as <HI>Eutropius</HI> &s;aith were in time pa&s;t called <HI>Quadi) Cae&s;ar</HI> writeth to haue been diuided into foure <HI>Pagi.</HI> At this time they diuide it into thirteene parts, which they call <HI>Cantones</HI> or <HI>Angules. Heluetia</HI> they now call <HI>Switzerland</HI> and <HI>Eydg|no&s;chafft,</HI> of the league and confederacie which they haue made betweene them|&s;elues.</P>
<P>Some men doe thinke this countrey to be the highe&s;t of all <HI>Europe,</HI> for that it is wholly almo&s;t &s;ituate within the Alpes, the highe&s;t mountaines of the &s;ame <HI>Europe,</HI> and becau&s;e the greate&s;t riuers of the &s;ame, <HI>Rhein, Rhodan</HI> or <HI>Ro&s;ne,</HI> and <HI>Po,</HI> &s;pringing from hence as from a very high place, do runne into diuers coa&s;ts of the world. This countrey is euerie where full of &s;teepe hilles, deepe valleys, great lakes, cleere &s;prings and brooks. The&s;e mountaines do ap|peare white with continuall &s;now, &s;o that to tho&s;e which behold them afar off, they &s;eeme to be nothing but hard &s;tone: yet notwith&s;tanding the Medowes after they haue beene burnt, are found to be very fat. In them are fed &s;heepe and kine, from whence great profit ari&s;eth vnto the inhabitants. For from thence whey, (as <HI>O&s;waldus Molitor</HI> writeth) chee&s;e, butter, and other white meats are made in &s;uch abundance, that not only <HI>Switzerland</HI> is glutted with &s;uch things, but al&s;o the nations nere adioyning are from thence very plentifully &s;erued. For they are tran&s;ported from hence into <HI>Sweueland,</HI> beyond the mountaine <HI>Iura</HI> into <HI>Italie,</HI> and into diuers other places. And that which may hardly be beleeued, as the &s;ame man affir|meth for certaine, that of twentie kine the yeerely profit is one hundred crownes, and all charges borne which is be&s;towed vpon hou&s;e-keeping, men-&s;eruants, and maid-&s;eruants. Here-hence it is, that &s;o great a people is po&s;sibly able to liue and be mainteined in &s;o &s;trait a place and little plot of ground.</P>
<P>The thirteene Cantones of this countrey (as we &s;aid they are commonly called) are, as <HI>Glarean</HI> recko|neth them vp, <HI>Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Wry, Schwitz, Siluan, Tugi, Glaron, Ba&s;ell, Friburg, Solodurn Schafhu&s;en,</HI> and <HI>Kei&s;er-&s;tul.</HI> The gouernment and charge generally of the whole countrey is in the hands of tho&s;e Cantones: for the rule or gouernment of <HI>Heluetia</HI> is an <HI>Anarchia,</HI> and is not &s;ubiect to the command of any Prince. The&s;e, when there is any thing that falleth out which concerneth the whole countrey or gouern|ment of the &s;ame, do meet all ioyntly together, and do determine vpon that which they thinke meet: o|therwi&s;e &s;euerall magi&s;trates do gouerne the &s;euerall cities. The&s;e cities therefore are linked together by a certaine bond of friend&s;hip and league, whereupon they are called <HI>Eydtgno&s;&s;en,</HI> that is, ioyned in one couenant. Tho&s;e of <HI>Rotweill, Sangall, Doggenburg,</HI> and <HI>Lepont,</HI> haue combined them&s;elues al&s;o to tho&s;e thir|teene Cantons, with the like bond of amitie.</P>
<P><HI>Heluetia</HI> is &s;ituate (that we may de&s;cribe it in the plaine&s;t maner) betweene the riuer <HI>Rhein, S. Claudius</HI> mountaine, the lake of <HI>Geneua,</HI> (which of the Latine writers is commonly called <HI>Lacus Lemanus</HI>) and <HI>Italie.</HI> Vpon the Ea&s;t it hath the countie of <HI>Tiroll:</HI> vpon the South, the Duchie of <HI>Millan,</HI> and the countrey of <HI>Pei|mont:</HI> vpon the We&s;t it bordereth vpon <HI>Sauoy:</HI> the other part of it lieth vpon <HI>Burgundie, France,</HI> and <HI>High Germanie.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;aid, that <HI>Switzerland</HI> among&s;t the mountaines doth conteine many valleys: of which &s;ome there are, that do tend from the tops of the Alps toward <HI>Italie,</HI> inhabited of diuers kinds of men. For <HI>Giles Schude</HI> writeth, that tho&s;e which do inhabit the vale of <HI>Augusta</HI> or <HI>Val de Osta,</HI> where in times pa&s;t the <HI>Sala&s;si</HI> dwelt, are for the mo&s;t part all Merchants factors. In <HI>Ce&s;ie</HI> vale they are almo&s;t all Stone-cutters and Ma&s;ons. From <HI>O&s;cell</HI> vale do come Cutlers or Smithes, which do make &s;word-blades, and kniues, and &s;uch as doe turne woodden di&s;hes and trenchers. All the inhabitants of the vale <HI>Vege&s;e</HI> are Chimney-&s;weepers, and &s;o that &s;louenly kinde of men, which liue by &s;weeping of chimneys, and are wont to wander vp and downe thorow <HI>Germany, France, Italie,</HI> and euen as farre as <HI>Sicilia,</HI> are bred here. In the vale <HI>Galanch</HI> they are all ei|ther dre&s;&s;ers of Ro&s;en, or Basket-makers. But the&s;e like beggers wander from countrey to countrey: yet all the re&s;t do liue vpon their trades.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that which <HI>Cae&s;ar, Strabo</HI> and other ancient writers haue written of this countrey, thou may&s;t reade many other things in <HI>Giles Schude, Vadian, Francis Niger</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ana, Mun&s;ter, Henry Glarean,</HI> and <HI>O&s;wald Molitor</HI> in the commentaries vpon him; as al&s;o in <HI>Iohn Stumpe,</HI> who hath written an huge volume of this nation.

<HEAD>The Countie of TIROLL.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Earledome of <HI>Tyroll</HI> was adioyned vnto the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;trich,</HI> in the yeere after Chri&s;ts birth 1360. by <HI>Rodulph</HI> the &s;onne of Duke <HI>Albert.</HI> This Countie is &s;o rich in Siluer mines, e&s;pecially neere the towne of <HI>Schwatz,</HI> that it may not onely be preferred before a rich Dukedome, but al&s;o may iu&s;tly &s;eeme to compare with a large Kingdome. For it payeth yeerely vnto the Prince (as <HI>Cu&s;pinian</HI> in his hi&s;torie of <HI>Au&s;trich</HI> reporteth) three hundred thou&s;and crownes of golde. Moreouer in it is found ab&s;olutely the be&s;t bra&s;&s;e, when as &s;car&s;e other where not any is found that will abide the hammer. This prouince is &s;ituate almo&s;t within the Alpes, betweene <HI>Bauiere</HI> and <HI>Italie.</HI> The chiefe cities in it, are <HI>Oenipons,</HI> now commonly called <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> where the Princes Court of this region is ordinarily kept, where al&s;o the Coun|cell-table and Parliament for this prouince and for <HI>Au&s;trich</HI> is held. There al&s;o did we behold with admiration the hou&s;e of the Lord Maior, vpon the roofe all guilt ouer with infinite co&s;t and charges. Next vnto it is <HI>Bolzan</HI> the Mart-towne; and the ca&s;tle of <HI>Tyroll,</HI> of which the whole countrey tooke his name. Then <HI>Trent,</HI> famous for the generall Councell held there within our remembrance. This is &s;ubiect vnto the Dukes of <HI>Au&s;trich,</HI> yet partly vnto the Bi&s;hops of that &s;ea, and is placed in the confines of <HI>Germanie</HI> and <HI>Italie,</HI> whereupon almo&s;t all the inha|bitants doe vnder&s;tand and &s;peake both the languages.

The Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Brixia,</HI> and the towne of <HI>Briomeck,</HI> with a ca&s;tle which belongeth vnto the &s;ame Bi&s;hop.

<P>There is a place in this Map, which the inhabitants call <HI>Czyrcknitzer&s;ee,</HI> of a little towne neere vnto it, called <HI>Czyrcknitz, Lazius</HI> &s;aith that <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth it the Mere of <HI>Lugey,</HI> it is &s;ituate in the prouince of <HI>Carnioll.</HI> This place (&s;o I call it; for whether I may more truly terme it a lake, a parke, or a field, I know not) as the &s;ame <HI>Lazius</HI> hath, euery yeere yeeldeth corne, fi&s;hing and hunting. But here I thinke it be&s;t fir&s;t to &s;et downe his de|&s;cription out of <HI>George Wernher</HI> a little more at large: It is enclo&s;ed, &s;aith he, on euery &s;ide with mountaines, and is in length about a mile and a halfe, but in bredth &s;omewhat le&s;&s;e. In many places it is eighteene cubits deepe, and where his depth is lea&s;t, it is equall vnto the full height of a tall man. Out of the hilles round about on euery &s;ide certeine &s;mall brooks do runne, ech from his &s;euerall channell; from the Ea&s;t coa&s;t three; from the South, foure. Euery one of the&s;e the farther they runne, the le&s;&s;e water they containe; for the earth &s;o continually &s;oa|keth it vp, that at la&s;t it is wholly con&s;umed by certeine &s;tonie ditches, &s;o framed by nature, as they do &s;eeme to haue beene made and cut out by the arte and indu&s;trie of man. <HI>Lazius</HI> thinketh them to be certeine &s;ignes and arguments of the &s;ailing of the Argonautes vnder the earth. Heere the waters doe &s;o mightily &s;well, that by no meanes they may be receiued: whereupon it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that the ditches doe in &s;uch maner &s;well backe againe, that neither they only doe not receiue the water, but al&s;o what they haue receiued, they powre backe againe &s;o exceeding &s;wiftly, that a nimble hor&s;eman by running &s;hall hardly be able to auoid the violence of the &s;treame. Therefore which way &s;oeuer the waters &s;hall finde any way out, they i&s;&s;ue forth and &s;pread them|&s;elues &s;o broad, that they make a great lake. The&s;e waters do returne almo&s;t as &s;wiftly as they came, yet not by tho&s;e ditches only; but the ground euery where almo&s;t doth &s;o receiue them, as if they were powred thorow a &s;ieue. This when the inhabitants do perceiue will come to pa&s;&s;e, they by and by &s;topping the greater pa&s;&s;ages to the vttermo&s;t they may, they runne thither to fi&s;h by great troops: which is not only a plea&s;ant pa&s;&s;e-time to them, but al&s;o is very gainfull and profitable. For the&s;e fi&s;hes being &s;alted, are carried out in great plentie vnto the neighbour-regions round about. Then the lake being dried, &s;ucceedeth an harue&s;t, on that part where the &s;oile is &s;owen; and the &s;ame is &s;owen againe before the next floud It is &s;o fertile of gra&s;&s;e, that euery twentie dayes it may be mowen. Who is it, that which here doth not admire the wonderfull works of &s;porting nature?</P>

But the commendation of this country, &s;et out by <HI>Plinie,</HI> with as great a maie&s;ty of words, as that countrey doth excell the re&s;t of the countreys of the world, I cannot but I mu&s;t needs, before I pa&s;&s;e from it, &s;et downe in this place by way of digre&s;sion; for &s;o he &s;peaketh of it in his third booke and fift chapter: ITALIE <HI>the nur&s;e and mother of all nations, cho&s;en by the prouidence of God, to adde a lu&s;tre to the very heauens them&s;elues, to vnite di&s;per&s;ed kingdomes, to temper and mollifie their rude and vnciuill maners, to draw the di&s;&s;onant, barbarous and &s;auage langua|ges of &s;o many diuers people, by the entercour&s;e of one refined &s;peech to a conference and parley, to teach ciuilitie to men, and briefly to make this one a common countrey for all the nations of the world. But what &s;hall I &s;ay more? Such is the excellencie of all places, that any man &s;hall come vnto, &s;uch is the maie&s;tie of all things, and of all people which do po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it. The citie of</HI> Rome, <HI>which in it &s;ee|meth only to excell, and to be a worthy face for &s;o glorious a necke, with what words or eloquence may I expre&s;&s;e it! How beautifull is the countenance of</HI> Campania <HI>by it &s;elfe! how great and many are the glorious plea&s;ures and delights of the &s;ame! That it is manife&s;t that in this one place nature hath &s;hewed all her skill in a worke wherein &s;he meant e&s;pecially to delight. And now indeed &s;uch is the vitall and continuall hol&s;omne&s;&s;e of the temperate aire, &s;uch fertile plaines and champian grounds, &s;uch &s;unny banks, &s;uch harmle&s;&s;e fore&s;ts, &s;uch coole and &s;hady groues, &s;uch fruitfull and bountifull kinds of woods, &s;uch fertility of corne, vines annd oliues, &s;uch goodly flocks of &s;heepe, &s;uch fat beeues, &s;o many lakes, &s;uch &s;tore of riuers and fountaines euery where watering and bedrenching it, &s;o many &s;eas, hauens or ports as it were bo&s;omes of the land euery where open and ready to entertaine and receiue the traffique of all lands, and it &s;elfe running into the &s;ea as it were willingly offering it &s;elfe and earne&s;tly de&s;iring to helpe and &s;uccour mortall men di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame. I doe omit to &s;peake of the fine wits, natures and maners of the people of the &s;ame, as al&s;o of the &s;euerall nations ouercome by it partly by valour, and partly by humanity.

<P>_THe originall of the name of <HI>Forum Iulij, Leander</HI> &s;aith, diuers writers haue diuer&s;ly &s;ought and cen&s;ured. Some doe thinke it &s;o called of <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar. Blondus</HI> &s;eemeth to affirme it to haue tooke his name of the citie <HI>Forum Iulij.</HI> Antiquities do te&s;tifie that this region hath beene called <HI>Aquilegia,</HI> of <HI>Aquilegium</HI> his chiefe or metropoli|tane city. La&s;tly, it is certaine that it is called <HI>Patria</HI> of the Venetians: which name as yet al&s;o it reteineth to this day. <HI>Blondus</HI> &s;aith, that it was long &s;ince called <HI>Li|burnia:</HI> but from whence, when, or for what cau&s;e it was &s;o called, he &s;heweth not. The fir&s;t that had here ought to doe, were the <HI>Euganei, Veneti, Troiani, Galli;</HI> and after tho&s;e, the Romans: vnder whom it did continually per&s;i&s;t, &s;o long as the fortune and maie&s;tie of the Roman Empire did &s;tand &s;ound and whole: which at la&s;t declining, it came into the hands and iu|ri&s;diction of the barbarous nations which oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Italie,</HI> e&s;pecially the Lombards, and &s;o remained vnto the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the great. After that, the gouernment thereof was in the power of the Patriarch of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> vntill at length the Venetians (de&s;irous to enlarge their territories on this &s;ide) reduced it wholly vnder their iuri&s;diction, who at this day po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the region is thus: It beginneth from a plaine abbuttant vpon the &s;ea, and &s;o by a little and little encrea&s;ing, fir&s;t it ri&s;eth vp in little hilles, and then into very high mountaines, which almo&s;t on euery &s;ide &s;o enclo&s;e his borders, that this plaine enuironed about with the toppes of moun|taines as with a wall, &s;heweth like a Theater, it is open but at one narrow &s;traight, by the which, as by a gate, ferrying ouer the riuer <HI>Sontio</HI> from <HI>Tarui&s;io,</HI> it may only be entred. The other borders of it, the Alpes on euery &s;ide doe limit: and therefore not to be come vnto but by the &s;ea-ports or valleys of the mountaines, or els ouer their tops. It hath vpon the &s;ea-coa&s;ts very many hauens. In this mo&s;t good|ly countrey are large champians watered with many plea&s;ant &s;treames, and tho&s;e fields exceeding fer|tile: for it aboundeth with vines, yeelding a kinde of wine, which <HI>Plinie</HI> reckoneth and commendeth for the be&s;t, and calleth it <HI>Vinum Pucinum,</HI> of the place. The mountaines of this countrey are very rich almo&s;t of all &s;orts of mettals; to wit, of Iron, Lead, Tinne, Bra&s;&s;e, Quicke-&s;iluer, Siluer and Golde. They haue al&s;o Marble, white, blacke, and party-coloured: Pretious &s;tones; as Carneols, Berylls, &amp;c. and cry&s;tall. Here are all &s;orts of fruits, and apples of a mo&s;t excellent ta&s;te: Woods both for fuell, tim|ber, and hunting, mo&s;t &s;tately: plea&s;ant and beautifull meddowes, and pa&s;tures mo&s;t excellent pa&s;tu|rage for cattell. The aire is temperate. The fields of them&s;elues doe abound with all things nece&s;&s;ary for the v&s;e of man, as al&s;o for plea&s;ure and delight. The people of this countrey are mo&s;t apt not only vnto all artes and liberall &s;ciences, but al&s;o for all merchandi&s;e and &s;uch other trades of life. The mo&s;t famous cities in it are <HI>Aquileya,</HI> adorned with the title of a Patriarchy. This citie <HI>Mela</HI> nameth, The rich: In times pa&s;t it was the &s;eat of the Emperours, and therefore it was called, Another <HI>Rome,</HI> and was in compa&s;&s;e twelue miles. In it there haue beene accounted long &s;ince an hundred and twentie thou&s;and citizens. The great pro&s;peritie and flouri&s;hing e&s;tate of this citie, e&s;pecially grew by the great throng|ing hither of Merchants; for that from all quarters almo&s;t of the world, by rea&s;on of the great com|modiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the place, ea&s;ie and &s;afe entrance vnto it a&s;well by land as by &s;ea, merchandi&s;e were conueyed to this citie as to a common ware-hou&s;e. That great trade of merchandi&s;e ended together with the fortune of the citie, the Venetians growing mightie, and drawing vnto them&s;elues all meanes of trade and traffique: &s;o that now of a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and populous city, it is almo&s;t wa&s;t and de&s;ert. <HI>Vtina,</HI> which al&s;o is called <HI>Vtinum</HI> (the Italians vulgarly call it, <HI>Vdene;</HI> the Dutch <HI>Weyden</HI>) &s;ituate in a plaine, hath a &s;trong ca&s;tle built vpon the toppe of an hill, rai&s;ed by the labour and indu&s;trie of man, contein|ing at this day fortie furlongs in compa&s;&s;e. <HI>Tergeste Trieste</HI> vpon the &s;ea &s;hore, a colonie of the Romans. <HI>Goritia,</HI> &s;ometime (if I be not deceiued) called <HI>Noreia.</HI> Here are many monuments of great antiquitie to this day remaining.

<P>The liberties or ground belonging to this citie is in length, from the little towne <HI>Baruchello,</HI> vnto <HI>Riua</HI> (which is on the farther &s;ide of <HI>Lago de Garda</HI>) &s;ixtie fiue miles: in bredth, which beginneth at <HI>La torre delle confine,</HI> vnto <HI>Riuoltella,</HI> for|tie miles: and conteineth in all 1443378. fields (&s;o the common people of <HI>Italie</HI> call the mea&s;ure whereby they mea&s;ure their lands, <HI>Seardeonius</HI> interpreteth it Akers) whereof 1223112. are fertile, 220266 are barren: which notwith&s;tanding dayly (by the indu&s;try and diligence of the husbandmen) are made more fruitfull.</P>
<P>There is in this tract a very high mountaine (the Mappe placeth it betweene <HI>Lago de Gardo</HI> and the riuer <HI>Ade&s;e</HI>) which they call <HI>Baldo.</HI> This hill is very well knowen to Herbori&s;ts and Apothecaries, which flocke hither from all quarters, and do gather many kindes of herbs and roots nece&s;&s;ary in Phy&s;icke, and good and hole&s;ome for the v&s;e of man.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o here in a certaine vale called <HI>Policella,</HI> a place named <HI>Negarina:</HI> where there is a very hard &s;tone to be &s;eene, hauing vpon it teats carued to the iu&s;t fa&s;hion and proportion of a womans brea&s;ts; out of the which pappes water doth continually di&s;till and droppe; wherewith if a nur&s;e or a woman giuing &s;ucke doe wa&s;h her brea&s;ts dried vp by &s;ickne&s;&s;e or any other mi&s;chance, it pre|&s;ently draweth downe the milke againe.

<P><HI>_LEander</HI> in the de&s;cription of <HI>Italie,</HI> (after a long di&s;cour&s;e of the gouernment of this Duchie) maketh this relation of <HI>Millane</HI> his chiefe citie: The citie <HI>Millane,</HI> &s;aith he, is &s;o conueniently &s;eated, that be&s;ides the great &s;tore of fruite which the ground of his territories do yeeld, out of <HI>Gallia Ci&s;alpina</HI> or <HI>Lombardie,</HI> all things, a&s;well for plea|&s;ure and delight as for profit and nece&s;&s;arie v&s;e in mans life, may be ea&s;ily tran&s;por|ted thither. It is &s;o great, that it may well compare with the greate&s;t cities of all <HI>Europe.</HI> It hath very longe and large &s;uburbes, by which it is greatly augmented &s;ome of them &s;o huge, that they may contend for bigne&s;&s;e with other great cities of <HI>Italie.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding of late yeares they &s;uffered great wrecke, by rea&s;on of the mortall warres and continuall troubles betweene <HI>Charles</HI> the fift and the French and Venetians. By which they were by fire and &s;word almo&s;t vtterly ouerthrowne and de&s;troied, although now by great diligence and indu&s;trie of the citizens they are reedified againe. Wide and deepe diches full of water do compa&s;&s;e both the citie and &s;uburbes: by which on euery &s;ide by boate and barge &s;uch great &s;tore of proui&s;ion is brought vnto it, that there is not any thing heere which is not to be bought at a rea&s;onable rate. It is very admi|rable in my conceite, to record the great aboundance and plenty of all things nece&s;&s;ary for the v&s;e of man. So many there are and &s;uch diuer&s;e &s;orts of Artificers here, and &s;o great a concour&s;e, as is wonder|full and may &s;carcely be told: whereupon that common by-word of the vulgar &s;ort did ari&s;e, <HI>He that would repaire all Italie, mu&s;t fir&s;t pull downe Millane:</HI> to wit, that by this meanes out of his holes and ne&s;ts the &s;warmes of Artificers might be di&s;pear&s;ed into all quarters of <HI>Italie.</HI> The citie hath very &s;tately and beau|tifull buildings: e&s;pecially the gorgeous and &s;umptuous edifice, which they call <HI>The hou&s;e,</HI> reered with in|finite charge, and &s;uch wonderfull workeman&s;hip, that there is but a very few Churches of the whole world that may be compared, vnto it, whether you re&s;pect the huge greatne&s;&s;e, and ingenious Archite|cture, or the price of the Marble and rare worke of the &s;ame: for that not onely euery way within and without it is beautifully trimmed and pargetted ouer with white marble, but al&s;o it is bedecked with a wonderfull imagery, wrought in Marble with exceeding cunning. Be&s;ide very many famous Chur|ches and Chappels e&s;pecially Grace church, and Praechers church, &s;ituate ouer again&s;t the mo&s;t &s;trong Ca&s;tle of <HI>Porta Iouia:</HI> hauing an <HI>Hemi&s;phere</HI> made by <HI>Lewis Sfortia</HI> the Duke of <HI>Millane:</HI> vnderneath the which hee together with his wife lie buried, enclo&s;ed in a tombe of the be&s;t marble. To this Church is adioy|ned the &s;tately Abbey of the Friers Predicant, with a goodly Librarie and a very faire Chamber or Hall trimmed about with the &s;torie of the &s;upper of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, an admirable peece of worke, done by the hand of <HI>Leonardo Vincio</HI> a Florentine &s;ufficiently approuing the great skill and cunning of the ingenious workeman, by the iudgement of all men experienced in the Art of painting. There are very many gorgeous hou&s;es of priuate citizens euery where to be &s;eene within the citie. The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Porta Iouia,</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t contriued fortification in all Chri&s;tendome, which hitherto could neuer be &s;urprized and forcibly taken by any enemie. There are be&s;ides the&s;e very many excellent buildings in <HI>Millane,</HI> which heere I mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e ouer with &s;ilence. Thus farre <HI>Leander,</HI> who doth excellently de&s;cribe the re&s;t of the townes and places of his territories of this citie. See al&s;o <HI>Volateran</HI> in his Geography, <HI>Geor|gius Merula, Bernard Arlun,</HI> and <HI>Bonauenture Ca&s;tillion,</HI> who hath written a &s;euerall Treati&s;e of the <HI>In&s;ubres,</HI> of their auncients &s;eats and antiquities. Moreouer <HI>Bernardine Corius</HI> hath written the Millane hi&s;torie in the Italian tongue. <HI>Laonicus Chalcocondylas</HI> al&s;o &s;peaketh &s;omething of the happy e&s;tate of this citie, and a|mong&s;t other things he doth excellently de&s;cribe and &s;et out the fable of the Dragon, which made this citie de&s;olate in the time of the <HI>Mariangeli,</HI> from whence the armes and cogni&s;ance of this city were deui|&s;ed, as is very likely. But it will not be ami&s;&s;e to adioine to the&s;e the opinion of <HI>Procopius,</HI> who writeth that this city doth &s;urpa&s;&s;e the city of <HI>Rome</HI> in greatne&s;&s;e, multitude of citizens, and other great ble&s;sings of God.</P>
<P><HI>Liguria</HI> al&s;o, which in this Chart is wholly de&s;cribed, is bounded with the riuers <HI>Varo</HI> and <HI>Magra,</HI> the Apenine mountaines and the Ligu&s;ticke &s;ea, (a branch of the Mediterranean &s;ea) now called <HI>Leonino.</HI> This now they call <HI>Riuiera di Genoa,</HI> of <HI>Genua</HI> his chiefe citie.

<P><HI>_CRema</HI> a towne in the confines of <HI>Millane,</HI> is a Ca&s;tle &amp; place of garri&s;on of the Venetians. This, as <HI>Lean|der</HI> affirmeth, vnder the gouernment of the &s;ame Venetians; hath &s;o incre&s;ed in multitude of citizens, and goodly buildings, that it may well be accounted among&s;t the mo&s;t famous places of all <HI>Italie.</HI> Wherefore they v&s;e to &s;ay in a common prouerb, in their vulgar tongue, <HI>Barleta</HI> in <HI>Puglia, Pratum</HI> in <HI>To&s;cana, Crema</HI> in <HI>Lombardia:</HI> &s;ignifying the excellency, &s;tateline&s;&s;e, and riche&s;&s;e of the&s;e three places. The Veneti|ans haue often a&s;&s;aied to adorne the towne with the title of a city: but the citizens, fearing that whereas now it is accounted among&s;t the be&s;t townes, it &s;hall then be reckoned among&s;t the meane&s;t cities, haue hitherto with|&s;tood that their purpo&s;e. It is &s;eated in a plea&s;a~t plaine, in compa&s;&s;e large &amp; wide, fortified with a &s;trong wall, fa|mous for wealth, very populous, and abounding with all things nece&s;&s;ary: for the &s;oile of the territorie and li|berties of this towne is very fertile, and yet by the great diligence and indu&s;trie of the husbandmen, it is dailie bettered and amended. Many brookes, well &s;tored with diuers &s;orts of fi&s;h, do euery where water this prouince. <HI>Blondus</HI> writeth, that after that <HI>Fredericke Barbaro&s;&s;a</HI> had &s;poiled <HI>Cremona,</HI> hee built <HI>Crema</HI> in &s;corne, to hinder and di&s;grace it.

Liuy</HI> &s;aith, that it is the chiefe city of the Cenomanes. <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Epi&s;tles of this writeth thus vnto <HI>Iunius Mauricus, Brixia</HI> is that city which con|&s;tantly retaineth as yet much of that graue mode&s;ty and old frugalitie of our auncient Italians. It hath beene graced with the title of a Duchie, for &s;o I find written in <HI>Diaconus</HI> his 5. booke of <HI>Lombardie</HI> in the 36. Chapter. But becau&s;e that none of the late writers, (that I may &s;ay nought of the more ancient) haue de&s;cribed this citie more learnedly and eloquently, than <HI>Pighius</HI> in his <HI>Hercules Prodicius,</HI> thou &s;halt heare him &s;peake in his owne termes. <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> which is &s;eated at the foot of the mountaines, may contend with mo&s;t of the cities of <HI>Italie,</HI> for antiquitie and &s;tateline&s;&s;e of buildings, <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar Scaliger,</HI> a famous Poet of our age, hath thus de&s;cribed it in this Epigramme; <HI>Thou</HI> Brixia <HI>great which proudly ouerlook'st the boornes and lowlie plaine, by due de&s;ert now iustlie mayst the &s;oueraigne Empire claime.

The &s;hire is very fertile of oile, wine, corne, and mo&s;t excellent fruites of all &s;orts. It hath al&s;o &s;ome rich veines of Mettalls, but e&s;pecially of Iron and Copper; whereof ari&s;eth to this citie great gaine and commodity. <HI>Liuie</HI> and other good authors report, That <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> was built by the <HI>Galli Cenomanes,</HI> about the time of the Romane kings, which afterward the Romanes, hauing &s;ubdued all that part of the countrey of the <HI>Gaules</HI> which lieth beyond the riuer <HI>Po,</HI> reduced vnder their iuri&s;diction. It is ap|parant out of <HI>Liuie,</HI> how firme it &s;ometimes &s;tood with the Romans, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e mo&s;t dangerous warres between them and <HI>Hanniball.</HI> Some would haue it to haue beene made a Colonie pre&s;ent after the end of the League-warre, when as <HI>Cneius Pompeius Strabo,</HI> the father of <HI>Pompey</HI> the great, planted colonies in <HI>Verona</HI> and other cities beyond the riuer <HI>Po.</HI> Not long after, by the fauour of <HI>C.

<P>The riuer <HI>Mela</HI> or <HI>Mella;</HI> of which <HI>Virgil</HI> maketh mention, doth runne through the midde&s;t of this &s;hire; as al&s;o <HI>Catullus</HI> in this ver&s;e affirmeth, <HI>Brixia Cygnaea po&s;itus in &s;pecula, Flauus quam molli percurrit flumine Mella.</HI> Old <HI>Brixia</HI> plac'd amidde the brookes, as gardian of the Swans, The riuer <HI>Mella</HI> kindly greet'th, and watereth all his lands. This riuer retaineth the name of <HI>Mella</HI> vnto this day. Notwith&s;tanding it runneth not by it now, as you may &s;ee, although not farre off from thence it pa&s;&s;eth through his liberties. The little riuer which runneth along by the city, is now called <HI>Garza:</HI> but I thinke that in old time it was al&s;o called <HI>Mella.</HI> And I thinke I may truly affirme, that the riuer <HI>Mella,</HI> when it approacheth neere vnto the city, &s;preadeth it &s;elfe into two channells, both of them retaining the &s;ame name, do make a riuer-iland, (like as <HI>Nilus</HI> maketh <HI>Heracleopolites,</HI>) and then againe falling into one &s;treame &s;till keepe the name of <HI>Mella,</HI> and hauing &s;o, heauily laden, runne for many miles toge|ther, at length it vnladeth it &s;elfe into the riuer <HI>Ollio.</HI></P>
<P>But before I fini&s;h the di&s;cour&s;e of this Mappe, I haue thought good to &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Lakes of the &s;ame. The lake <HI>Benacus</HI> (called of the poet <HI>Catullus, Lydius) Capriolus</HI> thinketh to haue been &s;o named of the city <HI>Benaco,</HI> &s;ometime &s;eated vpon his brinke, a mention of which to this day remaineth &s;till in a village called <HI>To&s;colano,</HI> which thou &s;ee&s;t vpon his we&s;t &s;ide, &s;tan|ding vpon a brooke of the &s;ame name. A memoriall of this city is pre&s;erued in an auncient monument, who&s;e in&s;cription <HI>Ma|nutius</HI> &s;etteth downe in his Orthographie. This lake is now called <HI>Garda,</HI> of the ca&s;tle <HI>Garda</HI> placed oppo&s;ite vnto <HI>Benaco</HI> vpon his ea&s;t banke. This lake, as <HI>Alexius Vgonius</HI> writeth in a letter of his to <HI>Cardinall Poole,</HI> aboundeth with &s;tore of fi&s;h, which for goodne&s;&s;e do far &s;urpa&s;&s;e all others. It is enclo&s;ed on euery &s;ide with mo&s;t plea&s;ant hilles: into it from all quarters the cleare fountaines flow. Goodly meddowes, vines, oliues, beeches, laurell, and cedars; be&s;ides townes, furni&s;hed with all maner of nece&s;&s;arie proui&s;ion, like a crowne be&s;et it round on euery &s;ide: &s;o that nothing at all of tho&s;e things may further be de&s;ired, which may make a champion country either beautifull to the eie, or commendable for profit and commodities &amp;c. While I was writing of this, there came into my mind what &s;peech I once had of this lake, with that mo&s;t learned good man <HI>Benedi|ctus Arias Montanus,</HI> (for we both had &s;eene the &s;ame, although not at the &s;ame time) in which we both did prote&s;t either to other, that we neuer in all our liues had &s;eene a place either more plea&s;ant for &s;ituation, or more delight&s;ome to the eie, &s;o that it was no maruell that <HI>Catullus</HI> did &s;o highly commend in his Epigrammes, that his <HI>Sirmion,</HI> and the waters of this lake. The other lake in this Cart is <HI>Sebinus</HI> or <HI>Seuinnus</HI> (for <HI>Plinie</HI> v&s;eth both) made by the riuer <HI>Ollio.</HI> This now they call <HI>I&s;eo,</HI> of a town of the &s;ame name &s;ituate vpon his banke. There is al&s;o another lake which they call <HI>Idro;</HI> by what name it was called of the auncients, or whether by any, I doe not certainly know. I know, that a certaine learned man doth hold it to be <HI>Brigantinus La|cus,</HI> whereof <HI>Plinie</HI> &s;peaketh; but why I am not of his opinion, I haue &s;hewed rea&s;ons in my Geographicall trea&s;ure.</P>

<HEAD>The Dukedome of PIEMONT.</HEAD>
<P>_THat prouince which was formerly called <HI>Taurinorum regio,</HI> is now termed <HI>Piemont</HI> or <HI>Pedemont,</HI> for that it is &s;eated at the bottome of the Alpes, which do diuide <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sauoy</HI> from <HI>Italie,</HI> and &s;o is as one would &s;ay, The pro|uince at the foot of the hilles. The bounds of this country are thus: on the Ea&s;t, the riuer <HI>Po:</HI> on the South, the Alpes of <HI>Liguria:</HI> vpon the We&s;t, the Alpes of <HI>France:</HI> on the North, <HI>Riuiera di Duria:</HI> It hath many good|ly fields full of plea&s;ant and fruitfull hilles, which yeeld corne and o|ther &s;orts of graine, excellent wines and fruite great &s;tore. It is well reple|ni&s;hed with Cities, Townes, and Villages.</P>
<P>Vnder the gouernment of the Lombardes it was called, The Dukedome of <HI>Taurine,</HI> (&s;o named of the city <HI>Taurin.</HI>) By them it was fir&s;t reduced into the forme of a prouince, vnder the iuri&s;diction of a Duke. The gouernment of the Lombardes being come vnto a period, it was made &s;ubiect to the Kings of <HI>Italie,</HI> who were alwaies cho&s;en by the Emperours: after that it was gouerned by diuers Petie Kings: and long &s;ince, in later ages it was accounted as part of the iuri&s;diction of the Princes, Earles, and Dukes of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> vntill the yeare 1536. when as <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t King of <HI>France</HI> tooke a great part of it: and now it is againe re&s;tored to the Duke of <HI>Sauoy.</HI> The chiefe city of this Prouince is <HI>Turin,</HI> &s;eated at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Dorra,</HI> where it falleth into <HI>Po.</HI> This citie <HI>Ptolemey, Plinie</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> call <HI>Augu&s;ta Taurinorum.</HI> That this citie in old time was a very famous citie, it may ea&s;ily appeare, in that it was a colonie of the Romanes. It lieth at the foot of the mountaines, it is foure &s;quare, and hath foure goodly gates. It is very famous for the rich I&s;le and &s;tate of the citizens, and is adorned with many goodly buildings, among&s;t the which the Cathe|drall Church is mo&s;t beautifull. It hath an Vniuer&s;itie of all maner of goodly learning: and is very well &s;erued with all &s;orts of proui&s;ion of victuall. The countrie is of a very good and fertile &s;oile, e&s;pecially toward the Ea&s;t and South, hauing Vallies mo&s;t rich for veines of Iron. <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> affirmeth that <HI>Taurin</HI> was the &s;eat of the Lombardes: vnto whom it was &s;ubiect vntill <HI>De&s;iderius</HI> their king was ouercome and taken by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great: and then it was brought vnder the &s;ub|iection of the Kings of <HI>Italie,</HI> Emperours, Countes, Montferrate and Marchions, and Dukes of <HI>Sauoy;</HI> to whom at this time it is obedient. Neere the head of the riuer <HI>Po</HI> toward <HI>Ripell</HI> (or <HI>C. de Reuell</HI>) and <HI>Pai&s;ana,</HI> are quarries of mo&s;t excellent Marble.</P>
<P>Vpon the North &s;ide of the fountaine of the riuer <HI>Po,</HI> beginneth a certaine plea&s;ant valley cal|led the Vale of <HI>Po,</HI> or (as the inhabitants terme it) the Vale of <HI>Lu&s;erna,</HI> of the towne <HI>Lu&s;erna</HI> which &s;tandeth in it.

The people of this place are commonly called, <HI>The Chri&s;tians,</HI> but in &s;ome maners and cu&s;tomes which they v&s;e, they &s;car&s;e follow the &s;trickt rules of Chri&s;tianity: nay they do ob&s;erue mo&s;t vngodly and wicked rites and ceremonies: among&s;t which this is one; That once in a moneth they ob&s;erue one day, in the which all meeting in a Church, after a collation made by their filthie and wicked Superintendent, at night, the Candles being put out; without any choice or regard, they fall like bruite bea&s;tes vnto their bea&s;tly Venerie. This we haue taken out of <HI>Leander,</HI> where thou mai&s;t read, if thou plea&s;e&s;t, many other &s;uch like things. <HI>Dominicus Niger</HI> al&s;o hath written of this Country.</P>

Of which the more ancient are, <HI>Q. Fabius Pictor, Sex. Rufus</HI> and <HI>P. Victor.</HI> Of the later writers, <HI>Blondus</HI> in his <HI>Italia, Fabius Caluus</HI> of <HI>Ra|uenna, Bartho.

<P>_THe bounds of <HI>Tu&s;cia,</HI> (which in time pa&s;t was called <HI>Hetruria</HI>) are on the Ea&s;t, the riuer <HI>Tyber:</HI> on the We&s;t, <HI>Macra:</HI> on the South, the Mediterran &s;ea: on the North, the Apen|nine mountaines. It is a mo&s;t goodly, beautifull and plea&s;ant country. The people are very ingenious and of a &s;ubtile witte, indifferently fitte either for peace or warre: for all maner of humane litterature, or for trades and merchandi&s;e. The nation hath alwaies been &s;uper&s;titious and much giuen to deuotion in religion, as is apparant out of ancient writers. The &s;ea coa&s;t toward the <HI>Tyrrhen</HI> or Mediterran &s;ea, is for the mo&s;t part in this our age full of Forre&s;ts, as al&s;o it was in the time of <HI>Vopi&s;cus,</HI> as he witne&s;&s;eth in the life of <HI>Aurelian;</HI> e&s;pecially a little beyond the riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> vntill one come beyond <HI>Plumbino.</HI> The inner part of the country is almo&s;t as much oppre&s;&s;ed with Mountaines.</P>
<P>In it are the&s;e cities, more famous than the re&s;t, <HI>Florence, Siena, Luca, Perugia, Pi&s;a, Viterbo,</HI> &amp;c. FLORENCE, or as they call it <HI>Fiorenza,</HI> is &s;ituate vpon ech &s;ide of the riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> conioined by foure faire bridges: it is a mo&s;t goodly and beautifull city, whereupon commonly they call it <HI>Fiorenza la bella, Florence</HI> the faire: as if indeed it might &s;eeme to bee the flower of all <HI>Italie.</HI> For it is adorned with &s;tately buildings, a&s;well Churches and religi|ous hou&s;es, as of priuate citizens. Among&s;t all other the Church of <HI>S. Maria Florida,</HI> wholly ouerlaid with Mar|ble, arched with a roofe of an admirable workeman&s;hip, neere to which is built a goodly &s;teeple for the bels, all of fine marble: not farre from which &s;tandeth the ancient Temple of <HI>Mars,</HI> of forme round very ingeniou&s;ly built, and of a cunning workeman&s;hip, now dedicated to <HI>S. Iohn Bapti&s;t.</HI> The dores of this Church are of ca&s;t bra&s;&s;e; a very rare and curious peece of worke: e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are next to the Church of <HI>S. Maria Florida,</HI> are &s;uch that all men of iudgement and experience mu&s;t ab&s;olutely confe&s;&s;e that in all <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ide, the like are no where to be &s;eene. But to reckon vp all the worthy buildings of this citie, a&s;well &s;acred as profane it were too tedious and would require more paper than this our purpo&s;ed di&s;cour&s;e will beare; He therefore that de&s;ireth to know more of the particulers more at large, let him reade <HI>Leander.</HI></P>
<P>SIENA lieth vpon the top of an hill, round begirt with high rocks of Tophus-&s;tone, gorgeou&s;ly bedecked with many noble mens hou&s;es: among&s;t the which is the great and large Church of our Lady, equall to the &s;tatelie&s;t and &s;umptuou&s;e&s;t Churches of all <HI>Europe;</HI> whether you re&s;pect the worth and price of the Marble whereof it is built: or the excellencie of the worke and workeman&s;hip of him that made it. Be&s;ides that there is a mo&s;t &s;tately hou&s;e of tree &s;tone built by Pope <HI>Pius</HI> II. with many other goodly hou&s;es. Worthy of commen|dation and record is the large and beautifull market place, with <HI>Branda</HI> the plea&s;ant fountaine alwaies full of mo&s;t cleare water.</P>
<P>PERVGIA is &s;eated vpon the mountaine Apennine, the greate&s;t part of the countrie ari&s;ing with goodly plea&s;ant hilles, fertile of &s;trong Wines, Oiles, Figges, Apples, and other &s;orts of mo&s;t excellent fruits. Beneath the citie at <HI>A&s;i&s;ia,</HI> as al&s;o toward <HI>Tuder,</HI> neere <HI>Tiber,</HI> the plea&s;ant champion fields do &s;pread them&s;elues, yeelding plenty of wheat and other kind of graine. The city by rea&s;on of the nature of the place is very &s;trong, adorned with gorgeous buildings both of religious hou&s;es and churches as al&s;o priuate citizens: together with a famous and large fountaine in the midde&s;t of the citie. It is very populous and the citizens are very ingenious and of couragious &s;tomackes, apt indifferently either for any maner litterature or for &s;eruice in the field.</P>
<P>PISA, long &s;ince hath beene a famous citie and many waies richly ble&s;&s;ed, not onely before the flouri&s;hing e&s;tate of the Roman Empire, but euen when it was at the full height: as al&s;o many yeares after. Many famous Marine-conque&s;ts, which it hath made, by which it brought the Ile <HI>Sardinia</HI> &s;ubiect to their command, do a|uouch this to be true. <HI>Panormo</HI> a faire citie of <HI>Sicilia</HI> they won from the Saracens: and of the bootie and &s;poiles taken in that warre, they began to build the great Church, which they call DOMNVM, as al&s;o the beautifull palace of the Bi&s;hop. It hath an Vniuer&s;itie or Schoole of all maner of Liberall Arts and Sciences, who&s;e foun|dation was laid in the yeare of CHRIST 1309.</P>
<P>VITERBO lieth in a plea&s;ant and &s;pacious champion hauing the Cyminian hilles (now of this citie called <HI>Mont Viterbo</HI>) vpon his backe&s;ide, &s;tately for many faire buildings and works of rare Art, among&s;t which is a fa|mous fountaine, from whence i&s;&s;ueth water in &s;uch abundance as is wonderfull.</P>
<P>LVCA is &s;eated in a plaine, not farre from the hilles foot, a city of goodly buildings. The people are neat, wi&s;e and ingenious; which haue mo&s;t di&s;creetly retained and kept their libertie of a long time whole in their owne hands, although they haue been often a&s;&s;aulted by their neighbours.

<HEAD>The Signiory of FLORENCE.</HEAD>
<P>_OF the city of <HI>Florence</HI> read <HI>Blondus,</HI> who in his view of <HI>Italie</HI> reporteth thus of it: They commonly af|firme, &s;aith he, that this citie was fir&s;t begonne by <HI>Sylla's</HI> &s;ouldiers, vnto whom this part of the countrie was by <HI>Sylla</HI> a&s;signed: and becau&s;e they fir&s;t began to &s;eat them&s;elues <HI>ad Arna fluenta,</HI> about the riuer <HI>Arno,</HI> they then intituled it by the name of FLVENTIA. And indeed <HI>Pliny,</HI> who of all the old writers fir&s;t mentioneth this place, &s;aith that the <HI>Fluentini</HI> were &s;eated neere the riuer <HI>Arno.</HI> The&s;e &s;ouldiers came hither about the yeare after the building of the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> 667. whereupon it appeareth that <HI>Florence</HI> was founded about 83. yeares before the birth of Chri&s;t. This city &s;uffered much wrecke in the time of the warres of the Gothes. Yet was it neuer, either by <HI>Totilas,</HI> or any other of tho&s;e ragings Tyrants, vtter|ly ra&s;ed or &s;poiled: And therefore that which &s;ome do write of the repairing of <HI>Florence</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, I can by no meanes allow when as the hi&s;tories of <HI>Charles</HI> written by <HI>Alcuinus</HI> his &s;choolema&s;ter, do only mention his keeping of Ea&s;ter heere at two &s;euerall times, as he went by this way toward <HI>Rome.</HI> It was pre&s;erued from a great hazard of vtter ouerthrow, which it was like to haue fallen into, by the manhood of one <HI>Farinata Vber|tino,</HI> when as they of <HI>Pi&s;a, Siena,</HI> and others of <HI>Tu&s;cane,</HI> meeting at a market in a con&s;ultation by them held, hauing generally deter|mined to ra&s;e <HI>Florence</HI> to the ground, &s;aid &s;toutly: That while he liued, he would neuer &s;uffer his deare Mother, which brought him vp, by them to be &s;poiled. Therefore <HI>Florence</HI> partly taking by force, and partly by other meanes drawing to their part the Fe&s;ulanes, about the yeare of Chri&s;t, 1024. was much enlarged in wealth and authoritie: at which time al&s;o <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> built the goodly Church of S. <HI>Miniate</HI> neere the walles of <HI>Florence.</HI> This city was twi&s;e within a little while, in the yeare 1176. mi&s;e|rably defaced, by ca&s;ualty of fire. From which time it fir&s;t began to be gouerned as now it is by the <HI>Priori,</HI> (the ma&s;ters of the twelue companies) and a Standard-bearer, <HI>Gonfalonerio,</HI> they call him. One of the fir&s;t Gonfalonerios was <HI>Stroza,</HI> a nobleman borne, of a great hou&s;e. The goodly <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> which in our time, by the ingenious direction of <HI>Philippo Brunalitio,</HI> a Florentine, was mo&s;t &s;tately arched, and dedicated to our Lady, was begun in the yeare of our Lord 1294. Foure yeares after that was that gorgeous Palace, where now the <HI>Priori,</HI> or Aldermen do keepe, fir&s;t founded. And fiue yeares after that was the <HI>Pomoerium,</HI> (the pro&s;pect, or wa&s;t ground, round about the city) leuelled and the walles of the city enlarged. <HI>Pi&s;torio</HI> was the fir&s;t city that the Florentines &s;ubdued vnder their command, as <HI>Leander,</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Italie,</HI> affirmeth vpon the te&s;timony of <HI>Aretino:</HI> where al&s;o he hath the&s;e words, of the diuers forms and different maner of gouernment of the &s;ame; After that it was repaired, &s;aith he, by <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, they yearely cho&s;e two Con&s;uls or Sheriffes, who with the a&s;si&s;tance of 100. Senatours or Aldermen, &s;hould gouerne the city. This forme of com|monwealth being altered, they created the <HI>Decemuiri,</HI> the tenne, called of them <HI>Antiani,</HI> about the yeare of Grace, 1220. as <HI>Volaterran</HI> affirmeth, or as <HI>Blondus</HI> &s;aith in the yeare 1254. After that in the yeare 1287. hauing redeemed their freedome of the Emperour <HI>Ru|dolfe</HI> for 60000. crownes, as <HI>Platina</HI> writeth, the <HI>Decemuiri,</HI> (the tenne) were reduced to <HI>Octouiri,</HI> (eight) and were called the <HI>Priori,</HI> (the mai&s;ters of the companies) ouer whom was &s;et the Standerd-bearer, called by them <HI>Gonfalonerio di Giu&s;titia,</HI> the Lord chiefe Iu|&s;tice; which office they were to hold but two monethes, and then others were to be elected. This forme of policy, for as much as I can gather out of hi&s;toriographers, was &s;ince that time thri&s;e altered. Fir&s;t in the yeare 1343. when the Florentines bought <HI>Luca</HI> of <HI>Ma&s;tino Scaligero</HI> for 5000. crownes; their forces being ouerthrowne by the enemie, they were con&s;trained to demand aid of <HI>Robert</HI> King of Naples, and obtained <HI>Gualterio Gallo</HI> a captaine of <HI>Athens</HI> for their generall, who by great &s;ubtilty and cunning getting the rule of the city, went to the Court and there depo&s;ed the <HI>Priori,</HI> and other Magi&s;trates from their office. Yet he enioied not his v&s;urped authority long, for the people at the per&s;ua&s;ion of <HI>Angelo Accieuolo</HI> Bi&s;hop of the &s;ea a Frier predicant, ro&s;e vp in armes, and depo&s;ing the Tyrant, re&s;tored the <HI>Priori</HI> and <HI>Confalonerio</HI> to their places againe. The &s;econd alteration of this Common-wealth happened in the time of <HI>Alexander</HI> the &s;ixth Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> when as his &s;onne <HI>Cae&s;ar Borgia,</HI> Duke of <HI>Valence,</HI> (neuer labouring to bring home a|gaine <HI>Peter, Iohn</HI> and <HI>Iulian,</HI> the &s;onnes of <HI>Laurence Medices,</HI> who but lately had beene bani&s;hed) at length brought the matter &s;o a|bout that the office of the <HI>Gonfalonerio</HI> &s;hould be giuen to <HI>Peter Soderine</HI> for a perpetuall and &s;tanding office: who together with the <HI>Priori</HI> cho&s;en euery two moneths, after the ancient cu&s;tome, mo&s;t wi&s;ely behaued him&s;elfe and orderly gouerned that Common|wealth: vntill at length being expelled by <HI>Raimundo Cordona</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour of <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the King of <HI>Arragon</HI> and Naples, (who was to re&s;tore <HI>Iohn Cardinall Medices,</HI> and his brother <HI>Iulian,</HI>) in the yeare of Grace 1412. and erecting the ancient maner of gouernment, which continued vntill the yeare 1530. In the meane time, although the city were commanded, at the di&s;cretion and direction of the Popes <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, (which was <HI>Iohn Medices,</HI>) and <HI>Clement</HI> the &s;euenth, (which was <HI>Iulius Medices</HI>) the ba&s;tard &s;onne of <HI>Iulian,</HI> the fir&s;t Cardinall <HI>Cortone&s;&s;e,</HI> hauing the ward&s;hip, and being Gardian to <HI>Hippolytus</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Iulian</HI> the &s;econd) &amp; of <HI>Alexander,</HI> the ba&s;tard &s;onne of <HI>Laurenznio,</HI> the nephew of <HI>Peter</HI> the &s;econd. Yet notwith&s;tanding the ancient Magi&s;trates were cho&s;en after the cu|&s;tome formerly v&s;ed. In that &s;ame yeare therefore, when as three yeares before, the Emperours &s;ouldiers be&s;ieging <HI>Clement</HI> the &s;e|uenth in <HI>Hadrians</HI> ca&s;tle, the city &s;haking off the yoke of bondage, obteined freedome, and endeuoured by all meanes to retaine the &s;ame, <HI>Philip</HI> the Prince of <HI>Aurange</HI> leading the armie of the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. <HI>Clement</HI> entreating that <HI>Alexander</HI> his ne|phew, whom before he had intituled Duke of <HI>Penna,</HI> to be brought againe into the city, forced it being much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of vi|ctuall to yeeld to the obedience of the Emperour. <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour at the reque&s;t of <HI>Clement</HI> the Pope pre&s;ently created <HI>Alex|ander</HI> perpetuall Priour: and thus the offices of the <HI>Priori</HI> and <HI>Gonfalonerio</HI> were vtterly taken away. Then, when the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> had created <HI>Alexander</HI> Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> and giuen vnto him in mariage <HI>Margaret</HI> his ba&s;tard daughter, in the yeare of our Sauiour, 1535. and two yeares after that, before the &s;euenth day of Ianuarie, <HI>Laurence Medices,</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Peter Francis,</HI> that he might &s;et his natiue country at liberty, as he pretended, had mi&s;erably &s;laine him. <HI>Co&s;mus Medices</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Iohn Medices</HI> was created Duke in his roome. Thus farre <HI>Leander,</HI> vnto which I may adioine the&s;e words of my kind friend M. <HI>Iohn Pinadello:</HI> When it was known &s;aith he, to <HI>Pius</HI> the fifth Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> that <HI>Co&s;mus Medices,</HI> Duke of <HI>Florence,</HI> had at that time taken great paines for the maintai|nance of the Church and Religion, and &s;pared no co&s;t in the warres again&s;t the hereticks, in the yeare 1570. in the moneth of Febru|arie comming to the city, crowned him in <HI>Aula Regia,</HI> the Kings hall (a place in <HI>Vaticana</HI> &s;o named) and gaue him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ours, the title of, The great Duke. In who&s;e Crowne the Pope cau&s;ed the&s;e words to be engrauen, PIVS QVINTVS <HI>Pont. Max. ob exi|miam dilectionem, &amp; Catholicae religionis zelum, praecipuum&abque; iu&s;titiae &s;tudium donauit.</HI> that is, Pius <HI>the fifth Bi&s;hop of</HI> Rome, <HI>in token of great loue, earne&s;t zeale of Catholique religion, and con&s;tant maintainance of true Iu&s;tice gaue this.</HI> Thus farre in few words of the Offices, Policy and Iuri&s;diction of this city.</P>
<P>I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e here to adioine another &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e, becau&s;e it is rare, and not altogether from the purpo&s;e: It is thus as <HI>Syffridus Pre&s;byter</HI> reporteth in <HI>George Fabricius</HI> his hi&s;torie of <HI>Mi&s;nia. Otho</HI> the third Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> lying at <HI>Mutina</HI> with his wife, the Empre&s;&s;e fell in loue with a certaine Earle: but when as he by no meanes would con&s;ent vnto her, &s;he &s;o diffamed him vnto her husband, the Emperour, that he commanded him to be beheaded before euer he had examined the matter. Who before he was beheaded, entreated his wife, that after his death by the triall of Hoate Iron, &s;he would approue to the view of the world, how wrongfully he was put to death. The day came, when as the Emperour &s;ate to heare the cau&s;es and complaints of widdowes and Or|phanes. Together with the&s;e came the late Counte&s;&s;e, bringing in her hand the Earles head: and demandeth what death that Iudge is worthy of, that had put a man to death wrongfully? The Emperour an&s;wered, He is worthy to lo&s;e his head. She &s;aith, Thou art the &s;ame man, who at the fal&s;e &s;ugge&s;tion of thy wife did&s;t vniu&s;tly cau&s;e my husband to be beheaded. The which when as the widdow approued vnto him by the maner of triall by hoat iron, the Emperour yeelded him&s;elfe into the hands of the widdow, willing to abide his de&s;erued puni&s;hment. Notwith&s;tanding by the mediation of the Bi&s;hop and the Nobility, he obtained of the Counte&s;&s;e re&s;pite for tenne daies, then for eight, then for &s;euen, la&s;tly for &s;ix. After the end of which daies, the Emperour hauing examined the matter, and being a&s;&s;ured of the truth, gaue &s;entence again&s;t his wife, that &s;he &s;hould be burned at a &s;take, and giuing foure ca&s;tles vnto the widdow, redeemed his life. The&s;e ca&s;tles are in the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Luna</HI> in <HI>Hetruria</HI> or <HI>Tu&s;cane,</HI> and they are called after the names of the daies of repreeue, The tenth, The eighth, The &s;euenth, and The &s;ixth. Thus farre <HI>Syffridus,</HI> which I thought good to &s;et down in this place, for to my knowledge no man els hath left any record of the&s;e ca&s;tles: neither are they named in this Mappe by our Au|thour, notwith&s;tanding that he hath de&s;cribed the country mo&s;t curiou&s;ly.</P>

<P><HI>_IOhannes Campanus</HI> writing of this country, affirmeth that although he had trauai|led and viewed many countries, yet he neuer &s;aw in all his life a more plea&s;ant country, and better manured then the country of <HI>Perugia.</HI> All things &s;eeme wa&s;t and wild to tho&s;e that are farre off, but if you &s;hall come more neere, nothing may be found more glorious either in re&s;pect of the husbandry of the land, or whole&s;omne&s;&s;e of the aire, or fertility of the &s;oile. The riuer of <HI>Tiber</HI> runneth through the midde&s;t of this country, and kindly watereth the &s;ame. Not farre from which is the city <HI>Perugia,</HI> &s;ituate vpon the Mount <HI>Apennine,</HI> built long &s;ince (as <HI>Trogus Pompeius</HI> affirmeth) by the Achaians; and of the twelue cities of <HI>Hetruria</HI> it is the chiefe. It was called <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> as the Capitall letters halfe a yeard &s;quare, grauen vpon the gate, do declare. This city, in regard of the nature of the place, is inuincible, richly beautified both with religious and priuate buildings of great &s;tate, and is very populous. This city aboue all the cities of <HI>Italie</HI> hath been euermore mo&s;t fortunate and happie, hauing retained the &s;ame &s;tate and gouernment little or nothing altered, which it enioied before the building of <HI>Rome;</HI> and that which afterward it had, (in the time when <HI>Rome</HI> was ruled by Kings, Con&s;uls, Emperours and Tyrants) at this time it reteineth. Yet it hath endured many and diuers greeuous and bitter &s;torms. For in the time when <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> was Con&s;ull, as <HI>Liuie</HI> reporteth, 4500. of his citizens were &s;laine. In the daies of the <HI>Triumuiri, Augu&s;tus</HI> be&s;iedged it, and forced it to great di&s;tre&s;&s;e for want of victualls, tooke it and ra&s;ed it to the ground, and was wholly defaced with fire, except only the Temple of <HI>Vulcane,</HI> as <HI>Appian</HI> recordeth. Afterward it endured the &s;euen yeares &s;iedge and batterie of the cruell Tyrant <HI>Totilas,</HI> and at length was &s;acked and &s;poiled &amp;c. Now it is &s;ubiect to the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and hath a famous Vniuer&s;itie, which was erected about the yeare of CHRIST, 1290. as <HI>Middendorpius</HI> hath written. Heere in the time of our grand|fathers, flouri&s;hed the mo&s;t renowmed Ciuilians, <HI>Bartholus</HI> and <HI>Baldus.</HI></P>
<P>In the precincts of this city is <HI>Lago di Perugia,</HI> the lake of <HI>Perugia,</HI> anciently called LACVS TRA|SVMENVS, famous long &s;ince for a great ouerthrow heere giuen by <HI>Hanniball</HI> to the Romanes; <HI>Appianus</HI> calleth it <HI>Lacus Ple&s;tinus,</HI> but for what rea&s;on I know not. It is in compa&s;&s;e, as the fore&s;aid <HI>Cam|panus</HI> writeth, about thirtie miles. The water of it is very cleare and pure, there are no riuers which runne into it, neither hath it any i&s;&s;ue forth, yet is his water &s;o exceeding &s;weet, that any man would thinke it were fedde from &s;ome running fountaine. It hath in it three I&s;les, whereof two, which are to|ward the North, are clo&s;e together; the one called the Greater, the other the Le&s;&s;er: (<HI>Maiores</HI> and <HI>Mi|nores</HI>) This is wa&s;t and not in habited, only it hath a Church &s;ituate vpon the toppe of an hill. The other, which is neere to the liberties of <HI>Cortona,</HI> conteineth about 200. families. The third, which is toward the South, and is bigger then the other two, is very populous and well inhabited. The inhabitants almo&s;t giue them&s;elues wholly to Fi&s;hing; they &s;ow little Corne: yet they do not neglect to plant vines. For wood, fuell and fodder they go out into the fields and woods neere adioining. Among&s;t the records of <HI>Lewis</HI> fir&s;t Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> there is mention of the&s;e three Ilands, where he nameth them MAIOR MINOR and PVLVENSIS, (now <HI>Polue&s;o</HI>) where I perceiue that they yet retaine their ancient names. No boggs, fennes, or &s;puing meeres do impech the &s;hore: this is full of Oliue gardens, which vpon the hills on euery &s;ide do adorne the Lake, and are for their wonderfull fertility very beautifull. In the plaine which is between the Lake and the Hilles, there is &s;uch abundance of Hempe and Flax, &s;o that in all <HI>Hetruria</HI> or <HI>Tu&s;cane,</HI> there is not more. No country yeldeth better Wines or &s;weeter Apples. The kinds of Fi&s;hes in the lake are not many, but the abundance is wonderfull; in which it farre excelleth all other Lakes of <HI>Italie:</HI> heere al&s;o the fi&s;hing continueth all the yeare long, yea euen in the dead of winter, which no other Lake in all <HI>Italie</HI> affoordeth. The&s;e fi&s;h in the winter are caried into <HI>Tu&s;cane, Vmbria,</HI> and <HI>Picenta:</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> al&s;o they driue much cattell daily to be &s;old. The &s;ame <HI>Campanus</HI> affirmeth, that heere they take a pickerell partly coloured, &s;potted with diuers green &s;pecks, of the which he reporteth &s;trange wonders: namely, that it doth engender with &s;erpents, and from thence it getteth tho&s;e &s;trange colours. (The common people, &s;aith <HI>Iacobus Greumus,</HI> in the twentieth chapter of his fir&s;t booke, verily be|leeueth that lampreies do engender with &s;erpents, which <HI>Plinie</HI> holdeth for a fable, notwith&s;tanding that hee often &s;eemeth to be much delighted in writing of fables. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> al&s;o writeth, out of the re|port of one <HI>Andreas,</HI> that the&s;e Lampreies which are bred of the viper, if they bite, the wound is deadly, which opinion he afterward reclaimeth as fal&s;e.) Againe he telleth of a Pike that lying vpon the drie land, which when a fox a&s;&s;aied to catch, one of his feet&s;tooke fa&s;t in his teeth; and both were found dead. <HI>Plinie</HI> in his &s;econd booke, chap. 107. te&s;tifieth that once this whole Lake did burne.</P>

<HEAD>The territories of the city of SIENA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_CAe&s;ar Orlandius</HI> a famous Ciuillian of <HI>Siena,</HI> &s;ent from <HI>Rome</HI> this Mappe, together with a briefe hi&s;tory of the city, taken out of a larger worke of his, (as he confe&s;&s;eth in his priuate letters to me, written of the originall of the &s;ame, to be in&s;er|ted into this our Theater of the World.</P>
<P>The city of <HI>Siena,</HI> &s;aith he, is &s;o ancient, that of his fir&s;t beginning there is nothing to be found in any approued old wri|ters. For that &s;ome do report it to haue beene built by the <HI>Galli Senones,</HI> which vnder the conduct of <HI>Breanus</HI> their ge|nerall, about 363. yeares after the building of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the &s;pace of &s;euen moneths (as <HI>Polybius</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> haue recor|ded) wan the city, it cannot be proued out of any good authour. For <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Sali&s;bury,</HI> which fir&s;t broached this opinion, (who for that he intituled his hi&s;tory by the name of <HI>Polycraticon,</HI> is therefore called <HI>Polycrates,</HI> or of others <HI>Polycarpus,</HI>) in the &s;euenteenth chapter of his &s;ixth booke, bringeth no authority for this his a&s;&s;ertion. And him&s;elfe confe&s;&s;eth in the twenty and fourth chapter of his eighth booke, that he was not familiarly known to Pope <HI>Adrian</HI> the fourth. Now it is apparant to all the world that <HI>Adrian</HI> the fourth &s;ate in the Papall &s;eat, but from the yeare of Chri&s;t, 1154. vnto the yeare 1159. and therefore the te&s;timony of <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Sale&s;bury,</HI> concerning the building of <HI>Siena,</HI> &s;o many yeares before he was borne, is of no validity at all.</P>
<P><HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> in his twentieth booke of his Annales, calleth this city <HI>Colonia Senen&s;is.</HI> Which words of his can by no meanes be vnder&s;tood of the other <HI>Sena,</HI> (which at this day al&s;o is in the country <HI>Piceno,</HI> and is vulgarly called <HI>Senegallia,</HI>) as &s;ome haue fondly imagined. For in the time of <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> that city of <HI>Piceno,</HI> was not euer called <HI>Sena,</HI> but <HI>Senogallia,</HI> or <HI>Senogallica,</HI> or <HI>Senogallia,</HI> as is mo&s;t manife&s;t out of the words of <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Ptole|mey.</HI> For <HI>Plinie</HI> reckoneth <HI>Coloniam Senen&s;em,</HI> among&s;t the mid land Colonies of <HI>Hetruria;</HI> and not many lines after he placeth <HI>Senagallia</HI> in the &s;ixth region of <HI>Italie. Ptolemey</HI> not only in the Latine copies printed, but al&s;o in mo&s;t ancient manu&s;cript Greeke copies, placeth <HI>Sena</HI> among&s;t the mid-land cities of <HI>Hetruria,</HI> but <HI>Sena Gallica,</HI> (for &s;o he termeth it) among&s;t the cities of the <HI>Senones,</HI> neere <HI>Ancona</HI> and the Temple of Fortune.</P>
<P>When this city fir&s;t was made a Bi&s;hops &s;ea, although as yet it be not certainly knowne, yet this is certaine, that among&s;t the 46. Bi&s;hops, or there a|bout, all of them neighbours to the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> (which in the fir&s;t Romane Synod in the time of S. <HI>Hilary</HI> Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> and fir&s;t of the name, a&s;&s;em|bled together in the yeare of Chri&s;t 465.) <HI>Eu&s;ebius Epi&s;copus Senen&s;is,</HI> was one of them.

Bi&s;hops, who &s;ub&s;cribed vnto the Epi&s;tle of <HI>Agatho</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> which the Legate &s;ent vnto the &s;ix generall Councill at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> held in the yeare 573. caried with them, this &s;ub&s;cription is found, <HI>Vitalianus epi&s;copus S. eccle&s;iae Senen&s;is.</HI> Whereupon it is manife&s;t that no man may cauill and &s;ay, that <HI>Epi&s;copus Senen&s;is,</HI> is the &s;ame that <HI>Epi&s;copus Senogallien&s;is:</HI> or that for <HI>Epi|&s;copetus Senatis,</HI> it &s;hould be written and read, <HI>Epi&s;copus Cae&s;enatis.</HI> As al&s;o for that out of <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> before mentioned, it is plaine, that euen in their daies, that <HI>Sena</HI> of <HI>Picenum;</HI> was not called <HI>Sena,</HI> but <HI>Senogallia:</HI> Moreouer al&s;o becau&s;e in the forenamed Councill of <HI>Lateran,</HI> not only <HI>Epi&s;co|pus Senatis,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Cae&s;enatis</HI> and <HI>Senogallien&s;is,</HI> named by one and the &s;ame name, &s;ub&s;cribed &s;euerally.

<P>Furthermore Pope <HI>Pius</HI> the 2. borne in <HI>Siena,</HI> in the yeare 1459. (which was the yeare of his creation) aduanced the Church of <HI>Siena</HI> from a Bi&s;hops &s;ea vnto the dignity of an Archbi&s;hopricke, and a&s;signed the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Suano, Clu&s;ino, Cra&s;&s;etano,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;ano</HI> Suffraganes to the Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Siena,</HI> and their Churches &s;ubiect to that &s;ea.</P>
<P>This hath <HI>Cae&s;ar Orlandius</HI> written, of the originall and antiquity of <HI>Siena,</HI> his natiue country, to be publi&s;hed, for no other cau&s;e, as he prote&s;teth, then that the fond opinion of <HI>Blondus,</HI> and others which haue written otherwi&s;e of it then the plaine truth is, might wholly be ra&s;ed out (if it were po&s;sible) of the minds of all men.</P>
<P><HI>Claudius Ptolemeus Senen&s;is,</HI> in his &s;ixth booke of epi&s;tles to <HI>Gabriel Cae&s;ano,</HI> hath mo&s;t elegantly de&s;cribed <HI>Monte Argentario.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MARCA ANCONA.</HEAD>
<P>_IN former times this region was called <HI>Picenum,</HI> now they call it <HI>Marca Ancona,</HI> of the head city of the &s;ame. Sometime it was called <HI>Marca Firmiana,</HI> of a town in this prouince, as <HI>Blondus</HI> hath giuen out. It lieth between the riuers <HI>I&s;aurus,</HI> (now called <HI>Foglia,</HI>) and <HI>Trento,</HI> and betweene the Hadriaticke &s;ea, and Mount Apennine. It is manife&s;t by ancient records that the <HI>Piceni, Vmbri</HI> &amp; <HI>Senones,</HI> were long &s;ince &s;eated in this tract. The country is a fertile &s;oile, yeelding in great plenty all maner commodities, but e&s;pecially for fruit trees &amp; corne it doth farre excell other places. <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> doth highly commend it e&s;pecially for oliues.</P>
<P>The head city, as we haue &s;aid, is <HI>Ancona,</HI> &s;o called of his &s;ituation, for that being &s;eated vpon the promontory <HI>Comerano,</HI> it lieth out into the gulfe of <HI>Venice</HI> like an arme or elbow. Whereupon the ancient comes of this city, (which heere oft times are found within the earth) are ob&s;erued to be &s;tamped, with an arme holding a penne in the hand. The Hauen of this mo&s;t ancient city, was made by <HI>Traian</HI> the Emperour, as an in&s;cription in Marble doth giue to vnder&s;tand. Heere is al&s;o <HI>Aelia Ricina,</HI> otherwi&s;e &s;ince that called <HI>Rici|netum,</HI> (and at this day now, <HI>Recanati</HI>), is a towne &s;ituate vpon the toppe of an hill, where we &s;aw the Mart or Faire (which there is kept at certaine times of the yeare) vnto which they come almo&s;t from all quarters of the World. Not farre from hence is the Church of S. <HI>Maria Lauretana,</HI> with the hamlet <HI>Loreto,</HI> enclo&s;ed with a very &s;trong wall. The gorgeou&s;ne&s;&s;e of this church and holine&s;&s;e of the place is &s;uch, that &s;o &s;oone as one &s;hall &s;et foot within the dores, it will &s;trike him into a great admiration. This Church is well furni&s;hed with all maner of weapons and engins, both for offence and defence a|gain&s;t the a&s;&s;ault of Pirates. The village is inhabited almo&s;t of none els but Cooks, O&s;tlers, Shoemakers and &s;uch like fellowes, which attend heere ready to do any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, for &s;uch as re&s;ort hither almo&s;t all the yeare long in great numbers for deuotion: and to prouide and &s;erue them with &s;uch things as they want. Heere is al&s;o the town and ca&s;tle called <HI>Fabriano,</HI> who&s;e inhabitants do almo&s;t altogether liue by making of Paper, which thereof is called <HI>Charta Fabriana.</HI> There are al&s;o many other goodly towns in this prouince, which are excellently de&s;cribed in <HI>Leander. Franci&s;cus Pamphilus</HI> hath al&s;o written in ver&s;e a de&s;cription of this Shire.</P>
<P>The Mount Apennine in this place hangeth ouer this country with craggy topps exceeding high, in which is that huge caue that they call <HI>Sibyllas caue,</HI> (in their language <HI>Grotta de la Sibylla</HI>) and which the poets faine to be the <HI>Ely&s;ian fields.</HI> For the common people do dreame of one <HI>Sibylla</HI> to be in this caue, which heere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth a large kingdome full of gorgeous buildings and Princely palaces, be&s;et with plea&s;ant gardens, abounding with many fine wanton wenches and all maner of plea&s;ures and delights: all which &s;he will be&s;tow vpon them, which through this caue (which is alwaies open) will go vnto her: and after they haue been there the &s;pace of one whole yeare, they haue free liberty giuen them by <HI>Sibylla,</HI> (if they plea&s;e) to depart, and from that time, being returned vnto vs, they affirme that they liue for the re&s;t of their time, a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and happy life. This caue is knowne al&s;o to our countrie-men by the name of <HI>Vrow Venus bergh,</HI> that is, The Lady <HI>Venus</HI> mount. Whereupon they vulgarly &s;ing certaine Dutch rimes of one little <HI>Daniel</HI> (for &s;o the ballad calleth him) who after that he had liued a whole yeare in this caue, at la&s;t it repented him of this kind of life, therefore heere he leauing his Loue departeth, goeth to <HI>Rome,</HI> commeth to the Pope, confe&s;&s;eth his &s;inne, and de&s;ireth to be ab&s;olued. The Pope not deeming the &s;inne to be veniall, the &s;taffe which by chance he had in his hand, (withered and drie) &s;ticking it into the ground, &s;aid, that his &s;innes &s;hould then be pardoned when this &s;taffe &s;hall beare Ro&s;es. <HI>Daniel</HI> by this an&s;weare de&s;pairing of his &s;aluation, went away very heauy and di&s;content, and pre&s;ently taking two of his nephewes, his &s;i&s;ters &s;onnes with him, returneth againe vnto his Paramour. Within three daies after the &s;taffe was ob&s;erued to put forth blo&s;&s;omes: <HI>Daniel</HI> was &s;ought for vp and down, but could no where be found: For they do beleeue that he &s;pent the re&s;t of his life in this caue. But the &s;tory of this ballade is a worthy matter for a poeticall head, and to be deemed as true as the re&s;t of their fictions.</P>

<P>_IN the kingdome of <HI>Naples</HI> there is a prouince which they call <HI>Abruzzo,</HI> the Latines anciently named it, <HI>Aprutium:</HI> why it was &s;o called, as it is vncertaine, &s;o, that it tooke not his name of the <HI>Brutij,</HI> as &s;ome haue been of opinion, I make no que&s;tion.

The greater and bet|ter &s;ort of writers do beleeue that in it &s;ome part of the ancient name of <HI>Praetutiana</HI> doth as yet remaine. For <HI>Volaterranus, Blondus, Domi. Niger, Leander</HI> and <HI>Scipio Mazella</HI> do per&s;wade them|&s;elues, that the <HI>Samnites,</HI> (and among&s;t them the <HI>Praetutiani</HI>) the <HI>Peligni, Marucini, Ferentini, Ve&s;tini; Mar&s;i, Caraceni</HI> and <HI>Alben&s;es,</HI> haue formerly inhabited the&s;e places.

Scipio Mazella</HI> in his curious de&s;cription of the kingdome of Naples, affirmeth that this country is by &s;ituation and nature of the place very &s;trong, and inhabited by a &s;tout and &s;turdy nation; and the &s;oile is very fertile of wines and cattell. The chiefe cities of it are, <HI>Aquila, Interamna</HI> or <HI>Teramo, Amatrice, Atri, Pinne:</HI> and long &s;ince heere haue &s;toode <HI>Amiterno,</HI> and <HI>Furconio,</HI> both now defaced, yet of their ruines and a&s;hes is rai|&s;ed <HI>Aquila</HI> &s;ome fiue miles off, built vpon the toppe of an hill, as <HI>Volateran</HI> and others haue writ|ten.

The fields before this citie, do yeeld &s;uch great plenty of Saffron, that thereof yearely they make 40000. ducates. Heere is once a yeare kept a great Faire. It hath 110. Churches. Neere this city, as <HI>Blondus</HI> &s;aith, is a &s;tone, from vnder the which runneth a &s;treame of oile, which they call Oile of peter, or <HI>Petro|leum:</HI> and is de&s;ired and &s;ought for of many, but of the Almaines and Hungarians it is more e&s;teemed, then of the Italians. The &s;ame authour recordeth that the country people &s;hewed him a Peare-tree growing vpon an hill not farre from the head of the riuer <HI>Pe&s;cara</HI> or <HI>Aterno,</HI> &s;hooting vp in &s;uch a &s;ort, that the water falling vpon it, diuideth it &s;elfe into three parts, which become three great riuers, <HI>Velino, Tronto</HI> and <HI>Pe&s;cara,</HI> running three diuers waies. <HI>Ami|terno,</HI> in former times a goodly city, famous in hi&s;tories, and the natiue country of <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> the no|ble hi&s;torian, can hardly be di&s;cerned where it &s;tood: yet <HI>Blondus</HI> &s;aith, that they do yet &s;hew &s;ome pieces of the Theater, Temples, and Turrets. <HI>Mazella</HI> affirmeth that there yet do re|maine the Temple of <HI>Saturne,</HI> the tombe of <HI>Dru&s;us</HI> daughter, and a triumph of the Samnites engrauen in marble, a memoriall of their happie victory obtained again&s;t the Roman army, <HI>ad furcas Caudinas. Teramo</HI> long &s;ince called <HI>Interamnia,</HI> for that it is &s;ituate between three riuers, <HI>Fiumicello, Trontino</HI> and <HI>Vitiole,</HI> is the head city of this prouince; who&s;e Bi&s;hop is graced with many titles and dignities, and the lord of the &s;oile is called by the name of the Duke of <HI>Teramo. Adria</HI> the ancient colonie of the Romanes, is now called <HI>Atri.</HI> Some do thinke that the Empe|rour <HI>Hadrian</HI> was borne heere, and of it tooke his name, as al&s;o the Hadriaticke &s;ea, now called <HI>Mare &s;uperum,</HI> the higher &s;ea, the Gulfe or Bay of <HI>Venice. Furconium</HI> &s;ometime hath been a famous Bi&s;hopricke, who&s;e Bi&s;hops are often mentioned in the Councels and Synods held 800. yeares &s;ince, at <HI>Rome</HI> or other places of <HI>Italie.</HI> At this day only &s;ome &s;mall mention is to be &s;een of it: for it was de&s;troied by the Lombardes, and the Bi&s;hops &s;ea, was by Pope <HI>Alexander</HI> the fourth, from thence tran&s;lated vnto <HI>Aquila.</HI> The arms of this country, as <HI>Scipio Mazella</HI> writeth, is an Eagle argent crowned, &s;tanding vpon three mounts ore, in a field <HI>Azure.</HI> He that de&s;ireth to vnder&s;tand more of this country let him repaire to the forenamed Authours, who I doubt not will &s;atisfie him to the full.</P>

<HEAD>The kingdome of NAPLES.</HEAD>
<P>_THis kingdome generally comprehended between the Adriaticke and Mid-land &s;eas, from the riuer <HI>Fronto</HI> and <HI>Fundi,</HI> a city &s;ituate vpon the lake <HI>Fundano,</HI> vnto the Frith <HI>Me&s;sina,</HI> (the Latines call it <HI>Fretum Mamertinum</HI> or <HI>Me&s;&s;anae,</HI> the Italians <HI>el faro di Me&s;sina</HI>) conteineth nine mo&s;t rich and goodly countries of <HI>Italie:</HI> namely the&s;e; A part of <HI>Latium, Campania felix, Lucani, Calabria, Magna Graecia, Salentini, Apuli Peucetij, Apuli Dauni,</HI> and <HI>Aprutium.</HI> The gal|lant city <HI>Naples,</HI> which gaue the name to the whole kingdome, &s;eated between the &s;ea &s;hore and the foote of mo&s;t plea&s;ant mountaines; hath a temperate and whole&s;ome aire, with mo&s;t &s;weet fields about it: and therefore in this our age, Princes, and Noblemen do re&s;ort hither, a&s;much as euer heeretofore: for almo&s;t all the Nobility of this whole kingdome do &s;pend mo&s;t of the yeare in this city, and all for the mo&s;t part haue heere mo&s;t beautifull and &s;tately hou&s;es: &s;o that the fre|quent throng of Princes, Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earles, Knights, Doctors, Barons, and Noble-men, is heere &s;o great, that there are very few cities of the world which in my iudgement, in that re&s;pect may compare with <HI>Naples.</HI> The city in compa&s;&s;e is very large and wide, gorgeou&s;ly built and &s;eated, as I &s;aid, between the &s;ea, and the goodly plea&s;ant hils, &s;trongly walled and fortified, e&s;pecially that part which was done of late daies at the commandement of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. The buildings either of Churches or priuate citizens hou&s;es are mo&s;t beauti|full and &s;tately, with diuers Ca&s;tles and Towers almo&s;t inuincible. But among&s;t the re&s;t, the hou&s;e of the Duke of <HI>Grauina,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Salerno,</HI> do farre excell. The &s;treets of the city are very faire and &s;traight. There are foure Courts, which they call Seats, <HI>Capuana, Nida, Montana,</HI> and <HI>S. Georgio,</HI> where the Princes, Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, and other of the Nobility do meet to con&s;ult of waighty matters and publike bu&s;ine&s;&s;es. The &s;trong Ca&s;tels are the&s;e; <HI>Ca&s;tello nouo,</HI> which <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> the fir&s;t rai&s;ed and entrenched with very great charges and expences, &s;o that now it may be accounted one of the mo&s;t defencible fortification of all <HI>Europe.</HI> Next to this is <HI>Ca&s;tello Capuano;</HI> which now is emploied for place of meeting for the &s;tate in con&s;ultation, for matters of the kingdome and city: Then is, <HI>Ca&s;tellum oui,</HI> a little di&s;tance without the city, &s;tanding vpon a rocke (the ancients called it <HI>Meagrum</HI>) compa&s;&s;ed round with the &s;ea. Be&s;ide the&s;e is <HI>Ca&s;tellum Santemeren&s;e,</HI> vpon a cliffe, looking ouer the walls of the city, lately fortified very &s;trongly by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth. Without the wals, vpon the South &s;ide of the city, there is a Block-hou&s;e in the &s;ea, a worke of wonderfull art and cunning workeman&s;hip, built for the defence and &s;afe|gard of the Hauen, continually full with &s;hippes almo&s;t from all quarters of the world. Heere al&s;o is an Vni|uer&s;itie where all maner of Arts and Liberall Sciences are taught and profe&s;&s;ed, vnto which there is great con|cour&s;e of &s;tudents from all places of the kingdome. Thus farre <HI>Vbertus Folietta,</HI> in a Treati&s;e of his, which he wrote and intituled <HI>Brumanum.</HI></P>
<P>Without the wals of this mo&s;t &s;tately city, there are mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;weet fields, yeelding all maner of things nece&s;&s;arie, not onely for the maintainance of man and bea&s;t, but al&s;o &s;uch as &s;erue for plea&s;ure and delight: E&s;peciallie with all maner of Corne and Graine, and of rich and &s;trong Wine &s;uch plenty, that he that hath not &s;eene the great &s;tore both of Corne and Wine that one Aker of ground doth yeeld, may hardlie be made to beleeue it. The Hilles and Mountaines in this place are very fertile, and full of mo&s;t excellent fruits: and &s;ome of them, enclo&s;ing the lowly plaines in manner of a Theater, do affoord plentie of Deere and game for the Nobilitie. Moreouer about <HI>Naples</HI> are mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fine Orchards, planted with Medicinall plants, and &s;uch like goodlie fruite trees, euerie where re&s;ounding with a mo&s;t &s;weet noi&s;e of brookes and &s;treames running to and fro: euery where mo&s;t fragrant and odoriferous &s;melles do offer them&s;elues vnto your &s;en|&s;es, &s;uch is the abundance of Myrtill, Laurell, Gel&s;emine, Ro&s;emarie, Ro&s;e-trees, &amp;c. in euerie corner. To be &s;hort, the beauty, delight&s;omne&s;&s;e, and elegancie of all places round about is &s;uch, as it doth almo&s;t exceed the capacitie of mans witte: no man need to wonder why in former times, as well as now, the Noble|men &s;o much delighted to dwell heere. This we haue taken out of <HI>Leander,</HI> where manie other things may be read of, who hath de&s;cribed the whole kingdome, this Citie, and the Liberties thereof, very curiou&s;lie, that indeed it is not nece&s;&s;arie to &s;end the Reader vnto any other Authour but <HI>Scipio Mazzella,</HI> (which in a &s;euerall and peculiar Treati&s;e, hath with extraordinarie paines, and diligence, &s;et out, in the Italian Tongue, a de&s;cription of this kingdome. There is al&s;o in Print a little booke, written by <HI>Alexander Andreas,</HI> of the warre betweene <HI>Philippe</HI> King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> the fourth Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI> out of which the Reader which is not &s;atis|fied with this di&s;cour&s;e of ours, may heere and there picke out &s;omething, concerning this kingdome, worth the noting and not triuiall.

Iohn Bapti&s;ta Caraffa, Pontanus,</HI> and <HI>Pandulfus Collenutius,</HI> haue written the hi&s;tories and chronicles of the kingdome of <HI>Naples:</HI> in the which they in diuers places &s;peake much of the &s;ituation of this country. <HI>Gabriel Barry,</HI> hath very curiou&s;ly de|&s;cribed <HI>Calabria,</HI> his natiue country, as <HI>Sanfelicius</HI> hath done <HI>Campania.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APVLIA, now called PVGLIA, or TERRA DI OTRANTO.</HEAD>
<P>_WE haue compo&s;ed this di&s;cour&s;e following of this countrey, out of the treati&s;e of <HI>Antony Galatey,</HI> which he wrote of the &s;ituation of <HI>Iapigya</HI> now called <HI>Terra di Barri.</HI> This country, &s;aith he, in re&s;pect of his &s;ituation, is &s;eated in the mo&s;t temperate place of the world. Of diuers authours it hath beene diuer&s;ly called by &s;undry names. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Herodotus</HI> called it <HI>Iapygia,</HI> others, <HI>Peucetia,</HI> others, <HI>Me&s;apia:</HI> others, <HI>Magna Gracia,</HI> Great <HI>Greece:</HI> others, <HI>Apulia:</HI> others, <HI>Calabria:</HI> (for that which now is called <HI>Calabria,</HI> was anciently called <HI>Brutia.</HI>) The corne, hearbs, and fruits of this country are of the be&s;t. The oats of this &s;oile, is as good as the barly of other countries: and the barly, as good as their wheat. Melones of a mo&s;t plea&s;ing ta&s;te, and Pome|citrons do euery where grow in great plenty. Phy&s;ick herbs of greater force then other where, are here in all places very common. The aire is very whole&s;ome, the &s;oile is neither drie, nor &s;qually or moori&s;h. But the&s;e &s;o great gifts and ble&s;&s;ings of God are intermedled with &s;ome mi&s;chiefe and danger: for heere nature doth breed a mo&s;t venemous and pernicious kind of &s;pider, (the Greeks do call it <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> or <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, the Latines <HI>Phalangium</HI> and <HI>Araneus</HI>) who&s;e poi&s;onous bite is onely cured by Mu&s;icke or Tabret and Pipe. Heere is al&s;o the venimous &s;erpent which the Greeks call <HI>Cher&s;ydros,</HI> the Latines <HI>Natrix terre|&s;tris,</HI> the Land &s;nake; we call it, if I be not deceiued, <HI>an Adder:</HI> and heere is a kinde of Locu&s;t, which hurt and mar all things they light vpon. The cities of this country, long &s;ince more famous, were, <HI>Tarentum,</HI> now <HI>Taranto,</HI> proudly &s;eated between two &s;eas exceedingly &s;tored with fi&s;h, in forme &s;omewhat like a long Iland. This city in all mens iudgement is inuincible. <HI>Callipolis</HI> (now <HI>Galipoli, Pliny</HI> cal|led it <HI>Anxa</HI>) is a city &s;ituate in the end of a promontorie or forland, &s;hooting farre out into the &s;ea, but with &s;uch a narrow I&s;thmos or necke-land, that in &s;ome places there is &s;carce &s;o much as a cartway. It is very &s;trong and round be&s;et with high cliffes; from the maine land there is only one entrance, in the which is a very &s;trong Ca&s;tell. <HI>Hydruntum,</HI> of them called <HI>Otranto,</HI> is the chiefe city, and (which is &s;omewhat more,) Metropolitan of the whole <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> or Demi-ile, and that not without cau&s;e: for whether you re&s;pect the anti|quity of it, the vertue and humanity of the citizens, ioined with valour and great magnanimity, it hath euer been of them accounted for a very famous and worthy city. It hath a very good and capacious hauen, but again&s;t the raging bla&s;ts of the North wind not &s;o &s;afe. It was &s;ometime very &s;trong and defencible, but now it lieth almo&s;t leuell with the ground. The fields adioining are very fruitfull; full of &s;prings and alwaies green. From hence <HI>Montes Cerauni,</HI> certaine hills of <HI>Epirus,</HI> (now called <HI>Cimera</HI> and <HI>Canina</HI>) may ea&s;ily be de&s;cried. Heere is the end of the Hadriaticke and Ionian &s;eas, as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth. <HI>Brundu&s;ium</HI> now called <HI>Brindi&s;i,</HI> a famous city, hath as notable a hauen as any in the world els where; the inner hauen is enclo&s;ed with ca&s;tles and an huge chaine: the outer hauen is heere and there be&s;et with rocks and &s;mall Ilands; but his mouth is by <HI>Alphon&s;oes</HI> meanes, &s;o &s;topped and dette vp, that there is no entrance, but for little &s;hippes and barges. It hath beene in former time a very populous city, now it is little inhabited. The&s;e are the chiefe marine ci|ties. He that would know more particularly of the ancient names, &s;ituation, antiquities, and priuate &s;tories of the mid-land cities and townes, we refer him to the learned di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Galatey,</HI> written of this his natiue country: to which if he plea&s;e to adioine the de&s;crip|tion of <HI>Leander,</HI> I per&s;wade my &s;elfe the thir&s;tie Reader &s;hall not know what els he may demand.</P>

<HEAD>CALABRIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_GAbriel Barrius Franci&s;canus</HI> hath very curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed <HI>Calabria</HI> in fiue bookes: which are imprinted at <HI>Rome</HI> with as lit|tle heedfull diligence. Out of him we haue culled the&s;e particulars following: CALABRIA, &s;aith he, a country of <HI>Italie,</HI> in forme and fa&s;hion not much vnlike a tongue, lieth between the vpper and neather &s;eas. It beginneth at the neather &s;ea, (the Greeks call it the <HI>Tyrrhen</HI> &s;ea, the Latines the Mediterran or Mid-land &s;ea,) from the riuer <HI>Talao,</HI> which runneth into the Bay of <HI>Polica&s;tro:</HI> at the vpper &s;ea (the <HI>Ionian</HI> &s;ea, the Grecians terme it) from the riuer <HI>Siris</HI> (otherwi&s;e &s;ometime cal|led, <HI>Senno</HI>) and coa&s;teth along vntill it come to the &s;treights of <HI>Faro di Me&s;&s;ano,</HI> and the city <HI>Regio:</HI> and &s;o being diuided longwi&s;e by the mount <HI>Apennine</HI> (heere they call it <HI>A&s;pro monte</HI>) it endeth in two capes or promontories, the one called <HI>Leucopetra,</HI> (of them <HI>Capo de Leocopetra</HI>) the other <HI>Lacinium</HI> (vulgarly of them called <HI>Cabo delle colonne,</HI> or <HI>Cabo dell' Alice.</HI>) Not only the plaines and champions, but euen the hillie places, like vnto <HI>Latium</HI> or <HI>Campania,</HI> are well &s;erued with water. What&s;oeuer is nece&s;&s;ary for the maintainance of mans life, this country doth yeeld in great abundance, it needeth no forraine commodities, but is able to liue of it &s;elfe. <HI>Calabria</HI> gene|rally is a good and a fertile &s;oile, it is not combred with Fennes, Lakes or Bogges, but is alwaies green, affoording good pa&s;torage for cattell, and excellent ground for all &s;orts of graine. The fountaines and brooks are many, and tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ing cleare and whole&s;ome. The &s;unnie hills and mountaines, open to euery coole bla&s;t of wind, are wonderfull fertile for corne, vines, and trees of diuers kinds, whereof ari&s;e great profit to the inhabitants. The valleies are plea&s;ant and fruitfull. The &s;hady groues and woods do affoord many plea&s;ures and delights. The goodly meddowes and pa&s;tures are richly decked with herbs, and &s;weet-&s;melling flowres, and euer-running &s;treames. And among&s;t other, heere is great plenty of Medicke fodder, wherewith they feed and fatte their cattell. Heere al&s;o grow many excel|lent phy&s;icke hearbs of &s;oueraigne vertues again&s;t diuers and &s;undrie di&s;ea&s;es. It bringeth forth diuers plants, as the Plane tree, <HI>Vitex</HI> or <HI>Agnus ca&s;tus,</HI> the Turpentine tree, the Oliue tree, <HI>Siliqua Silue&s;tris,</HI> Arbute or Strawberry tree, wild Saffron, Madder, Liquiri&s;e, Tube|ra or Sowbread. It hath al&s;o &s;ome hoate baths, continually di&s;tilling from their fountaines, which do cure aches and many other like maladies. In diuers places there are &s;prings of &s;alt water, whereof they make a kind of brine or pickle. It is well watered with many fine riuers, and tho&s;e &s;tored with &s;undrie &s;orts of fre&s;h fi&s;h. The &s;ea al&s;o on ech &s;ide yeeldeth great plenty of fi&s;h, both tunies, &s;word-fi&s;hes, and lampreies. There in many places is found the be&s;t Corall, both white and redde. Heere is mo&s;t plea&s;ant hunting and hawking: for in the&s;e quarters diuers and &s;undrie &s;orts of wild bea&s;ts do lodge; and as many birds and fowles do breed and build: wild boares, harts, hindes, goates, hares, foxes, lynces, otters, &s;querrells, martens, badgers, ferrets, porkupines, tortu&s;es, both of the waters and of the mountaines. Of fowles, phe&s;ants, partridges, quailes, wood-cocks, ring-doues, crowes, &amp;c. as al&s;o of many kinds of hawks it is euery where full. It maintaineth &s;ome herds of cattell and flocks of &s;heep and goats. It breedeth excellent hor&s;es, very &s;wift and of great &s;tomacke. Mettals heere were found in old time, and now al&s;o it aboundeth at this day with diuers kinds of mineralls: hauing indeed euery where mines of gold, &s;iluer, iron, &s;alt, marble, alabla&s;ter, cry&s;tall, marcha&s;ite, red-lead, or vermillion, copperas, alume, brim|&s;tone &amp;c. many kinds of corne, wheat, &s;iligo, beerbarly, rie, trimino, (we call it, I thinke, Turky wheat) barly, ri&s;e, and of &s;e&s;amum infinite &s;tore. It aboundeth al&s;o with all kind of pul&s;e, (<HI>legumina</HI> the Latines call them,) oile, wine and hony, and tho&s;e in their kinds the be&s;t. There are heere euery where orchards thicke &s;et with oranges, limons, and pome cittron trees. Heere al&s;o is made great plenty of excellent &s;ilke, farre better then any kind of &s;ilke made in other places of <HI>Italie.</HI> The Cotton tree <HI>(Go&s;sipium,)</HI> groweth heere plentifully. But what &s;hall I &s;peake of the kind temperature of the aire? For heere the fields both winter and &s;ummer are continuallie green. But aboue all things, there is nothing that doth argue the &s;ame more &s;oundly then that airy dew or heauenly hony, which they call <HI>Manna,</HI> that euery where di&s;tilleth from aboue, and is heere gathered in great abundance. So that that which the I&s;raelites in the wildernes did admire and hold for a &s;trange wonder, heere kind nature doth affoord of her own accord. It is adorned al&s;o with many goodly market towns, where marts and faires are kept at certaine times of the yeare. Heere in &s;ome places &s;till is ob&s;erued the ancient cu&s;tome of the Romanes v&s;ed at funerals and buriall of the dead, where a chiefe mourner (<HI>Praefica,</HI> they called her) is hired to go before the re&s;t of the mourners and &s;he to guide their mournefull ditties and to keepe time in their howling lamentations. The funerall being done and all ceremonies performed, the dead mans friends and kindred, bringing their meat and iunkets, do banquet altogether at the dead mans hou&s;e. The women of this country naturally, for mode&s;ty, and for that the waters of the&s;e places are good and whole&s;ome, drinke naught but water. It is a &s;hame for any women to drinke wine, except &s;he be very old, or be in child-bed, &amp;c. See more in the &s;ame authour. <HI>Cas&s;iodore</HI> al&s;o in his <HI>Variar.</HI> hath in diuers places many things of this country.</P>

In <HI>Plinies</HI> time there were 72. cities: at this day they report it to containe twelue Bi&s;hopricks, of great iuri&s;diction and large dioce&s;&s;es.

<HEAD>The Ile ISCHIA.</HEAD>
<P>_THat this Iland hath been in former times called AENARIA, ARIMA, INARIMA, and PITHECVSA, <HI>Homer, Ari&s;totle, Strabo, Pliny, Virgill, Ouid,</HI> and other good writers are &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es. Now it is called ISCHIA of the name of the city there, built vpon the top of an hill, in forme &s;omewhat like the Hucklebone, as <HI>Her|molaus Barbarons</HI> te&s;tifieth, which of the Greeks is named <HI>I&s;chia:</HI> or rather of the &s;trength and defenciblenes of the place, as <HI>Volaterranus</HI> thinketh. Although it be &s;ure that the&s;e be but &s;ynonymes of one and the &s;ame iland, yet <HI>Mela, Liuie,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> do &s;eeme to make <HI>Aenaria</HI> and <HI>Pithecu&s;a</HI> two di&s;tinct iles: as al&s;o <HI>Ouid</HI> may be thought to do in the&s;e ver&s;es: <HI>Inarimen Prochitam&abque; legit, &s;terili&abque; locatas Colle Pithecu&s;as, habitan|tum nomine dictus.</HI> By <HI>Inarime</HI> he &s;aileth, by <HI>Prochyte</HI> ile, by barren <HI>Pithecu&s;e,</HI> A town on toppe of loftie cragge, where wilie Apes do v&s;e. Where by <HI>Pithecu&s;as,</HI> as I thinke, he vnder&s;tandeth the city ancientlie, (as al&s;o now it is,) of the &s;ame name with the whole iland. Which, although now it be ob&s;erued to be ioi|ned to the Ile, yet in former ages it was called <HI>Gerunda,</HI> and was apart and di&s;ioined from the ile, as <HI>Pontanus,</HI> a man of good credit, doth te&s;tifie in his &s;econd booke which he wrote of the warres of <HI>Naples:</HI> where he affirmeth, that in his time it was ioined vnto the Iland by a cau&s;way made between them. <HI>Prochita</HI> not farre di&s;tant from hence, (which <HI>Plinie</HI> doth write to haue been &s;euered from <HI>Pithecu&s;a</HI>) doth &s;hew that this was &s;ometime adioined to, and &s;ometime di&s;ioined from this Iland. The &s;ame authour doth affirme, (which <HI>Strabo</HI> al&s;o doth approue,) that all the&s;e &s;ometime were cut off from the maine continent, and to haue been part of the cape <HI>Mi&s;eno.</HI> This doth the forenamed <HI>Pontanus</HI> in his &s;ixth booke confirme, in the&s;e words: That <HI>Aenaria,</HI> &s;aith he, was cutte off, from the maine continent, many things do demon&s;trate: namely, The torne rocks, The hollow ground full of caues, The nature of the &s;oile, like vnto that of the continent, leane, drie, and &s;puing out hotte &s;prings and fountaines. It breedeth flaming fires in the midde&s;t of the earth, wherefore it is manife&s;t that it conteineth much Alume. <HI>Andreas Baccius,</HI> in that his famous worke of the Bathes of the whole world, writeth, that this iland doth counterfait <HI>Campania,</HI> (of which it was &s;ometime a part) not only in re&s;pect of the fertility of the &s;oile, but al&s;o for like|ne&s;&s;e, and &s;imilitude of the bathes. <HI>Erythraeus</HI> vpon the 9. booke of <HI>Virgills</HI> Aeneiads, doth thinke it to be called <HI>Arima,</HI> of a kind of people or bea&s;ts &s;o named: and that <HI>Virgill</HI> was the fir&s;t, that when he tran&s;lated that of <HI>Homer,</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, of the Ionicke prepo&s;ition <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, and <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> altering the declen&s;ion and number, did make the new word <HI>Inarime.</HI> Yet <HI>Plinie</HI> in the 6. chapter of his 3. booke and <HI>Solinus</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>Polyhi&s;tor,</HI> are of a contrary opinion, which do affirme it to be of <HI>Homer</HI> al&s;o called <HI>Inarime.</HI> And as the &s;ame <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, it was cal|led <HI>Aenaria,</HI> for the &s;hips of <HI>Aeneas</HI> put into harborough heere: &amp; <HI>Pithecu&s;a,</HI> not of the great &s;tore of Apes there found, but of Coopers &s;hops or warehou&s;es. But this opinion the &s;ame <HI>Erythraeus</HI> in the fore&s;aid place laboureth to ouerthrow, as not altogether con&s;onant to the truth, for that of tunnes made for this purpo&s;e, he prote&s;teth that he hath not read of in any authour what&s;oeuer. Yet <HI>Seruius</HI> in my iudgement &s;eemeth vpon the forcited 6. of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneads, to &s;tand for <HI>Pliny,</HI> where he &s;aith, that by <HI>Cumae</HI> there was a certaine place named <HI>Doliola,</HI> that is, if we &s;hould interpret it, <HI>Tunnes.</HI> And it is more likely, that this Iland &s;hould take the name from that place, with which &s;ometime it was vnited, according to the opinion of the&s;e good authours, rather then of apes, (for I regard not the fable of <HI>Ouid</HI>) of which bea&s;ts none are heere, or euer were. That this Iland from the beginning hath been &s;ubiect to earth-quakes, flames of fire, and hot waters from thence oft breaking out, we are certified by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny.</HI> The mountaine which <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth <HI>Epomeus,</HI> and <HI>Pliny Epopos,</HI> now they call it S. <HI>Nicolas mount,</HI> which for the &s;ame cau&s;e they report to haue burned inwardly at the bottome: and being &s;ha|ken with an earthquake to haue &s;omtimes ca&s;t out great flakes of fire. Heere hence aro&s;e that fable of <HI>Typhon</HI> the giant, (wherof you may read in <HI>Homer, Virgill, Silius Italicus,</HI> (who calleth him <HI>Iapetus) Lucane</HI> and others) as the &s;ame <HI>Strabo</HI> interpreteth, which they fable to lie vnderneath this hill, and to breath out fire and water. That it is on euery &s;ide wonderfully fertile, of the la&s;t writers, <HI>Io. Ely&s;ius, Fran. Lombardus, Io. Pontanus, Solenander, Andreas Baccius,</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>Ia&s;olinus</HI> the authour of this map, hath &s;hewed abundantly: who in it doth reckon vp, be&s;ide the 18. naturall bathes which others haue written of 35. other, fir&s;t di&s;couered by him&s;elfe. The &s;ame author al&s;o be&s;ide the&s;e baths doth make mention of 19. &s;toues or hot hou&s;es, (<HI>fumarolas</HI> they call them) and 5. medicinall &s;ands, &s;oueraigne in Phy&s;ick for the drying vp of raw humours. Of this fire heere in the bowels of the earth, <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his booke of the Miracles of Nature, affirmeth that heere are certaine &s;toues, which do burne with fierie kind of force and exceeding feruent heate, and yet neuer do bur&s;t out into flames: But <HI>Ely&s;ius, Pandulphus</HI> and <HI>Pontanus</HI> do report the contrary. There is a place in this Iland <HI>I&s;chia,</HI> about a mile from the city of the &s;ame name, which, of the raging fire that happened heere in the time of <HI>Charles</HI> II in the yeare 1301. is at this day called <HI>Cremate.</HI> For heere the bowels of the earth cleauing in &s;under, by the fla&s;hing fire that flamed out, a great part of it was &s;o con&s;umed, that a &s;mall village being fir&s;t burnt down, was at the la&s;t vtterly &s;wallowed vp. And ca&s;ting vp into the aire huge &s;tones, intermedled with &s;moke, fire, and du&s;t, which falling againe by their own force and violence, &s;cattered heere and there vpon the ground, made a mo&s;t fertile and plea&s;ant iland, wa&s;t and de&s;olate. This fire continued the &s;pace of two moneths, &s;o that many, both men and bea&s;ts were by it de&s;troied: and many &s;hipping them&s;elues &amp; their goods forced to flie either to the ilands neere adioining, or to the maine continent. Yet this iland for many things is very fruitfull: for in it there are excellent good wines and tho&s;e of diuer&s;e kinds, as that which they call Greeks wine, Latine, Sorbinio and <HI>Cauda caballi.</HI> It beareth good corn about S. <HI>Nicolas</HI> mount. In it the Cedar, the pomecitron, and the Quince tree, do grow euery where mo&s;t plentifully. Alume and Brim&s;tone are found deep within the earth: it hath had long &s;ince &s;ome veines of gold, as <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ely&s;ius</HI> haue written, and now hath as <HI>Ia&s;olinus</HI> affirmeth. About the hill, (commonly called <HI>Monte Ligoro</HI>) there is great &s;tore of phe&s;ants, hares, conies, and other wild bea&s;ts: neere the cape of S. <HI>Nicolas</HI> they take much fi&s;h, and withall find much Co|rall. Not farre from thence is the hauen <HI>Ficus</HI> or <HI>Fichera,</HI> where the water boileth &s;o hot, that in it fle&s;h or fi&s;h are &s;odden in a &s;hort time, and yet notwith&s;tanding it is of a plea&s;ant ta&s;t and very &s;auory. There is a fountaine which they call <HI>Nitroli,</HI> in which this is admi|rable, that be&s;ides his great vertues for the cure of certaine di&s;ea&s;es, if you &s;hall lay flax in it, within three daies at the mo&s;t it will make it as white as &s;now. Whereupon the authour of this Table &s;aith, that this ile for bigne&s;&s;e, good aire, fertility of &s;oile, mines of mettall, &s;trong wines, doth far &s;urpa&s;&s;e the other 25. ilands which are in the bay of <HI>Naples.</HI> Betweene the foreland called <HI>Acus,</HI> the needle, and that other named <HI>Cephalino,</HI> there is a great caue, or &s;afe harborough for &s;hips, e&s;pecially for pinnaces &amp; tho&s;e le&s;&s;er &s;orts of &s;hips. Heere it is like that <HI>Aeneas</HI> landed, of which <HI>Ouid</HI> &s;peaketh: as al&s;o <HI>Pompey,</HI> when as he &s;ailed from <HI>Sicilia</HI> to <HI>Puteoli,</HI> whereof <HI>Appian</HI> writeth in his 5. booke of Ciuill wars. In this &s;ame Iland ouer again&s;t <HI>Cumae,</HI> there is a lake in which there is continually great plenty of Sea|mews or Fenducks (<HI>Larus</HI> or <HI>Fulica</HI>) the&s;e are very gainfull and profitable to the inhabitants. The words of <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;peaking of this iland are worth the noting. In the &s;ame, &s;aith he, a whole town did &s;inke: and at another time by an earthquake the firme land became a &s;tan|ding poole, <HI>&s;tagnum</HI> he calleth it: (although that the ancient printed copies for <HI>&s;tagnum</HI> haue <HI>&s;tatinas;</HI> in which place the learned <HI>Scaliger</HI> had rather read <HI>&s;tatiuas,</HI> meaning &s;tanding waters.) The &s;ame <HI>Pliny</HI> hath left in record, that if one heere &s;hall cut down a Cedar tree, yet it will &s;hoot forth and bud againe. <HI>Liuy</HI> &s;aith that the <HI>Chalciden&s;es</HI> of <HI>Euboea</HI> did fir&s;t inhabit this iland: yet <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith they were the <HI>E|retrien&s;es.</HI> But the&s;e al&s;o came from the ile <HI>Euboea.</HI> I am of opinion that <HI>Athenaeus</HI> in his 9 booke, although he nameth it not, yet he mea|neth this iland, which he affirmeth he &s;aw, (as he &s;ailed from <HI>Dicaearchia</HI> vnto <HI>Naples</HI>) inhabited by a few men, but full of copies. There is al&s;o neere vnto this, <HI>Prochyta,</HI> an iland &s;o named, not of <HI>Aeneas</HI> his nur&s;e, but becau&s;e it was <HI>profu&s;a ab Aenaria,</HI> &s;euered from <HI>Aenaria,</HI> or as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his 5. booke affirmeth from <HI>Pithecu&s;ae.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding in his I. booke he writeth that it was &s;undered from <HI>Mi&s;eno:</HI> yet both may be true: for a&s;well this, as that by inundations and tempe&s;tuous &s;torms were rent off from the maine land. The poets &s;ame that <HI>Minas</HI> the giant lieth vnder this Iland, as <HI>Typhon</HI> doth vnder <HI>I&s;chia.</HI> Of which <HI>Horace</HI> in his 3. booke of Poems writeth to <HI>Calliope. Andreas Baccius</HI> writeth thus of this ile; It is a little ile, &s;aith he, but very plea&s;ant, rich of mettals and hot bathes, notwith&s;tanding for the continuall fires, which the continuall tides of the &s;ea do kindle in it, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, it neuer was much inhabited. It retaineth &s;till the ancient name; for they now call it <HI>Procida.</HI> Of this iland you may read more in <HI>Scipio Mazella,</HI> in his additions vnto the tract of <HI>E|ly&s;ius</HI> of the Bathes of <HI>Puteoli.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CANDIA, &s;ometime called CRETA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_CReta,</HI> which now they call <HI>Candia,</HI> is bigger then <HI>Cyprus,</HI> but le&s;&s;er then <HI>Sicilia,</HI> or <HI>Sardinia:</HI> vnto which ilands only in the Mediterran &s;ea it is inferiour. Yet for worth and fertility it is equall to the be&s;t. Ancient Hi&s;toriographers do affirme that once it was famous for one hundred cities, and therefore was called <HI>Hecatompolis.</HI> In the time of <HI>Pliny</HI> it had not aboue forty. At this day, as <HI>P. Bellonius</HI> te&s;tifieth it hath not aboue three of any account, that is, <HI>Candy,</HI> a colonie of the Venetians, (whereof the whole iland is now named,) <HI>Canea</HI> and <HI>Rhetimo.</HI> The compa&s;&s;e of the iland is about 520. miles. It is euery where full of mountaines and hils, and therefore the inhabitants are much giuen to hunting. There is in it neuer a riuer that is nauigable, nor any venemous or hurtfull bea&s;t. The ex|cellent wine, which they heere call <HI>Malua&s;ia,</HI> and is from hence tran&s;ported almo&s;t into all countries, hath made this iland famous all the world ouer. This kind of wine old writers called <HI>Pramnium,</HI> as <HI>Bellonius</HI> recordeth. <HI>Vola|terran</HI> is of opinion that it is called <HI>Malui&s;ia,</HI> for <HI>Arui&s;ia,</HI> by the addition of one letter. And he furthermore addeth, that that kind of vine was fir&s;t brought into <HI>Creta</HI> from the cape <HI>Arui&s;ium</HI> in the ile <HI>Chios,</HI> (now <HI>Scio</HI>) and therefore the wines were called <HI>vina arui&s;ia.</HI> Heere is great &s;tore of <HI>Cypre&s;&s;e</HI> trees, (whereof they make their &s;hips,) which are of &s;uch great height, as <HI>Dom. Niger</HI> reporteth, that it is a mo&s;t goodly fight to behold. In this iland was the Maze or Labyrinth built by <HI>Daedalus</HI> after the patterne, as <HI>Plinie</HI> &s;aith, of that in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> A mention of which, as <HI>George Alexander,</HI> the Lieutenant of this iland for the Venetians, affirmeth in <HI>Volaterran,</HI> do re|maine vnto this day.</P>
<P>There is a mountaine, &s;aith he, cut through, hollow euery way with many windings and turnings, and hath one onely narrow and &s;traite en|trance. The guide, a man that well knoweth the place, goeth before with a burning torch, directing the way in and out, and &s;hewing the &s;trange cranks in the darke corners. But <HI>Peter Bellone,</HI> a curious &s;earcher of ancient monuments and antiquities, and one that in our age diligently viewed this iland, &s;aith that this in old time was a quarry of &s;tone, not a Labyrinth. (Notwith&s;tanding that the people of the country do &s;o call it) which indeed is more probable, &s;eeing that <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmeth that in his time there remained no &s;igne of it. But of this place take this de&s;cription of <HI>P. Bellone,</HI> There is a place between <HI>Gno&s;ium</HI> and <HI>Cortina,</HI> which hauing been ob&s;erued to be verie conuenient for the cutting and digging out of &s;tone, the country people made there a Stone-mine <HI>(lapidicinam)</HI> out of which when as many &s;tones were digged there were many windings and turnings left, &s;o that he which by him&s;elfe will venture to go vp and downe in this &s;tone-pit, he &s;hall light vpon many crooks and by-waies, and may ea&s;ily loo&s;e him&s;elfe. Neere to the riuer <HI>Leth,</HI> is this fal&s;ly-&s;uppo&s;ed-labyrinth, the which if any be de&s;irous to &s;ee, he mu&s;t needs v&s;e the help of &s;ome one or other of the country people of the next village, to go in before him with candle to guide and direct him. But in it &s;uch a number of Battes do lodge, that except a man do take great heed they will by their flying vp and downe, put out the candle with their wings. In the bot|tome of the pitte are found great heaps of Battes dong, and their little yong ones yet hanging vpon the &s;ides and wals. The dammes when they can no longer flie, do not cleaue and &s;ticke to the wall, nor &s;tand vpon their feet, but there they hang vpon the beams and rafters, as our Battes do in the clifts of timber and holes of walles. Thus farre <HI>Bellonius.</HI> (The like &s;tory vnto this, altogether as <HI>Bellonius</HI> reporteth it, in my mind I haue &s;een, when as for recreation I trauelled from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Ho&s;tia,</HI> and in my iourney at the hauen of <HI>Traiane</HI> I went vnder the ground, fir&s;t hiring mine ho&s;t to go before me with a light, that I might view the ruines of the &s;ame.) It was anciently dedicated to <HI>Iupiter,</HI> becau&s;e that heere, old folks did thinke, he was bred, and brought vp, and at length buried. <HI>Bordonius</HI> affirmeth that vpon the North &s;ide of this iland there is a great caue vnderneath the earth, made by the labour and indu&s;trie of man, forty cubites in length, and foure in breadth: which at this day they call <HI>Iupiters tombe,</HI> and that vpon the head of it yet to this day his Epitaph remaineth written in great Capitall letters.</P>
<P><HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that the people haue been long &s;ince accounted for the be&s;t Mariners, as being wholly inuironed with the &s;ea: and from thence aro&s;e that by-word, <HI>Creten&s;is mare ne&s;cit,</HI> A Cretian hath no skill in &s;ailing. They haue of old been very infamous for their leuity, deceit, lying, and other &s;uch like vices: Heere hence &s;prong the&s;e prouerbs, <HI>Cretiza cum Creten&s;i, Creten&s;is Creten&s;em, Creten&s;is cum Aeginate, E Creta raptus. &amp;c.</HI> of which thou mai&s;t read in <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> his Chiliades. Wherefore they are al&s;o ill reported of by S. <HI>Paul</HI> for the &s;ame faults. But I feare me lea&s;t that which hath commonly been &s;poken of the Cretian, may indeed be truly verified of many other Nations, nay I would to God that all Nations where&s;oeuer all the world ouer were not in this of kinne to the Cretians.</P>
<P><HI>L. Caecilius Metellus Creticus</HI> fir&s;t brought this iland vnder the command of the Romans, about the yeare 685. after the building of <HI>Rome:</HI> Af|terward it was &s;ubiect to the Emperours of <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> Then it was giuen to <HI>Bonifacius</HI> of <HI>Monteferrato:</HI> by whom it was &s;old to the Venetians, in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1194. to whom at this day it doth belong. Among&s;t the ancient Geographers <HI>Strabo</HI> hath curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed this iland: Among&s;t the latter writers <HI>Domi. Niger, Volaterran, Vadian, Zieglerus,</HI> and <HI>Bened. Bordonius,</HI> haue done the like. But mo&s;t excellently of all o|thers and exactly <HI>Iodocus Ghi&s;telius</HI> in his iourney to <HI>Hieru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Bellonius</HI> in his ob&s;eruations. <HI>Iodocus &agrave; Meggen,</HI> al&s;o hath &s;omething of this Iland, in his Peregrination to <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> worth the ob&s;eruation and reading. We are beholding to that braue nobleman, The Honourable <HI>Sign. Franci&s;co Superantia,</HI> a Gentleman of <HI>Venice,</HI> not only a louer of the Mathematicks and earne&s;t &s;tudent of Geographie, but a worthy e&s;teemer of all maner of learning.</P>

<HEAD>Certaine Ilands in the &s;ea ARCHIPELAGO.</HEAD>
<P>_THe <HI>Aegaean</HI> &s;ea (now called <HI>Archipelago</HI>) conteineth many ilands, as the <HI>Cyclades, Sporades</HI> and diuers others, of which, &s;ome of the chiefe we haue de&s;cribed in this plotte. NEGROPONTE, &s;ometime called <HI>Eubooea:</HI> his chiefe city then was called <HI>Chalcis,</HI> now they call it <HI>Negroponte,</HI> whereof the whole iland tooke the name. It was not long &s;ince wholly &s;ubiect vnto the Venetians: from whom it was taken by the Turks about the yeare of Chri&s;t 1471. It yeeldeth great plenty of oile, corne and wine, and is of all things that the earth bringeth forth, very fertile, e&s;pecially it affoordeth very good wood for the making of &s;hippes and gallies, as <HI>Anonymus</HI> reporteth, who wrote of the &s;acking and taking of it. The inhabitants (which is almo&s;t generally true in all the iles of this &s;ea) are partly Greeks, and partly Turks: but each v&s;eth his owne language and religion. NICSIA, in old time <HI>Naxos,</HI> is accounted one of the mo&s;t fertile ilands of this &s;ea. It yeeldeth good &s;tore of Wine. Some do thinke that heere is a veine of Gold, but &s;uch is the &s;louth and negli|gence of the people, that yet it is not knowne where about it is. Heere is a kind of Wa&s;pe who&s;e &s;ting they report to be deadly. Heere are very many Battes. It was &s;ometime belonging to <HI>Iohanni Quirino,</HI> a nobleman of <HI>Venice:</HI> afterward it came into the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of a certaine captaine named <HI>Iacobo Cri&s;po,</HI> whom <HI>Solimus</HI> the Turke draue from hence. Therefore it is now inhabited by Turks and Iewes.</P>
<P>SANTORINI, of the ancients called by the name of <HI>Thera&s;ia.</HI> This Iland ri&s;eth by little and little euen from the &s;hore vnto the midde&s;t, vntill it become an high mountaine, vpon who&s;e toppe is placed the ca&s;tle <HI>Scaro.</HI> The people for the mo&s;t part liue by fi&s;hing. This al&s;o, as the other, is vnder the command of the great Turke. SCIO, the old writers called it <HI>Chios,</HI> is all full of trees and mountaines: it is watered with many &s;mall brooks. <HI>Vinum arui&s;ium,</HI> (they now call it <HI>Malua&s;ia</HI>) was from hence fir&s;t tran&s;ported into <HI>Candia.</HI> This iland only breedeth the Ma&s;tiche-tree, who&s;e gumme from hence is conueied all Chri&s;tendome ouer. <HI>Andronicus Palaeologus</HI> the Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> gaue it to the Genowaies, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it vntill the yeare 1465. when as <HI>Soliman</HI> by a wile gatte it from them. The women of this ile are commended aboue all other for fauour and beauty. Of this you may read in <HI>Laonicus</HI> his tenth booke. RHODVS, &s;till retaineth the ancient name. It hath a city of the &s;ame name, very &s;trong and defen&s;ible, with a very large and capacious hauen. It is the more famous for the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> of the &s;unne, a &s;tatue or image &s;euentie cubites high, which being broken off at the knees by an earth-quake, was ouerthrown &amp; fell to the ground. Certaine Egyptians, as <HI>Domi. Niger</HI> re|porteth, in the time of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> the Emperour, pa&s;sing the &s;ea from <HI>Alexandria</HI> to <HI>Rhodus,</HI> among&s;t other things, ouerthrew this <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> brake it in pieces, and with the bra&s;&s;e did lade away 900. camels. It was giuen by <HI>Emanuel</HI> Emp. of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> vnto the knights of <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> which for a long time and often did valiantly defend it again&s;t the furious a&s;&s;aults of the Turks, vntill in the yeare 1522. when as <HI>Solyman</HI> be&s;ieging it round by &s;ea and land; they were forced to yeeld it vp, and to flie into the ile <HI>Melita.</HI> Of the&s;e &s;ee more in <HI>Theodoricus Adamaeus.</HI> STALAMINE, this the Gretians in old time called <HI>Lemnos.</HI> Of it read that which we &s;hall write in the de&s;cription of <HI>Cyprus.</HI> MILO, former ages long &s;ince cal|led it <HI>Melos.</HI> In it is a mine of Siluer, where al&s;o is found the Sardoine, a pretious &s;tone. METELLINO, old writers called it <HI>Le&s;bot.</HI> It hath a city of the &s;ame name, &s;haken and ruined by an earth-quake. They are vnder the gouernment of the Turke, as the other, yet they retaine their old language and religion. CERIGO, in old time they called it <HI>Cythera.</HI> SCARPANTO, the ancients named it <HI>Carpathus,</HI> or as <HI>Homer</HI> writeth it <HI>Crapathus:</HI> whereupon the &s;ea about this place was called <HI>Mare Carpathium.</HI> It is &s;ituate almo&s;t in the mid-way between <HI>Candia</HI> and <HI>Rhodus.</HI> It is in compa&s;&s;e forty, or as others affirme, fifty miles. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> in his commentaries vpon <HI>Homer,</HI> &s;aith that it is craggy and euery where mountai|nous and full of hils, and was called <HI>Porphyris</HI> in old time of the great abundance of Purples, (a kind of fi&s;h, whereof commeth the purple colour) found in this &s;ea: and <HI>Tetrapolis,</HI> of the foure cities in this iland. From this iland &s;prong that prouerbe, <HI>Carpathius leporem,</HI> as the &s;ame <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> deliuereth out of <HI>Iulius Pollux.</HI> It is &s;poken of tho&s;e which do &s;o do a thing, that afterward being done, they do repent them of it. Becau&s;e the&s;e Ilanders fir&s;t brought in hares into this country, and within a little while after, when they perceiued how they eat and &s;poiled their corne, they de|&s;troied them againe. It hath many Hauens, but tho&s;e very narrow, &s;hallow and dangerous. The inhabitants do &s;peake the Greeke tongue, and profe&s;&s;e the Religion of the Greeke Church, but are &s;ubiect to the iuri&s;diction and gouernment of the Signiory of <HI>Venice.</HI> You may read more of the&s;e ilands in <HI>Bordonius</HI> and <HI>Porcacchius,</HI> which in the Italian tongue haue written peculiar treati&s;es of Ilands.</P>

<HEAD>CYPRVS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_CYprus</HI> doth iu&s;tly challenge his place among&s;t the greater Ilands of the Mediterran &s;ea. The forme of the Iland is much longer than it is broad. The Metropolitan or chiefe city is <HI>Nico&s;ia. Famago&s;ta</HI> al&s;o is a mo&s;t goodly city, the Mart-towne of the whole Ile, and very rich in regard of the commodious hauen and great cu&s;tomes and toles there paid. It is inferiour to no Iland that I know: for it yeeldeth plenty of wine and oile: it hath al&s;o &s;uf|ficient corne to find it &s;elfe. Moreouer it hath had &s;ome veines of Bra&s;&s;e or Copper, in which veines there was al&s;o found <HI>Vitrioll</HI> and <HI>Rubigo aeris,</HI> the ru&s;t of bra&s;&s;e, &s;imples of &s;o|ueraigne vertue in the practi&s;e of Phy&s;icke. In it doth grow in great plenty, the &s;weet cane <HI>(canna mellis)</HI> out of which they do boile Sugar. It affoordeth an excellent kind of &s;trong wine, as good as that of <HI>Candy,</HI> which they call Malme&s;ey. There is a kind of &s;tuffe made there of goates haire, which now we call <HI>Chamelett,</HI> the Italians <HI>Zambelloto.</HI> This Iland &s;endeth ouer diuers commodities into other countries, where|of they yearely rai&s;e great profit and gaines; it doth not much &s;tand in need of any forrein commodities or mer|chandi&s;e. The aire is not very whole&s;ome nor healthfull. The people generally do giue them&s;elues to plea&s;ures, &s;ports and voluptuou&s;ne&s;&s;e: the women are very wanton, and of light behauiour. The fruitfulne&s;&s;e of it is &s;o great, that in old time they called it <HI>Macaria,</HI> that is, The Ble&s;&s;ed Iland; and the la&s;ciuiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the nation &s;uch, that vulgarly it was &s;uppo&s;ed to haue beene dedicated to <HI>Venus</HI> the Godde&s;&s;e of loue. It is 427. miles about, and 200. long, as <HI>Bordonius</HI> hath recorded. The Venetians do hold it by right of inheritance, and is vnder them gouerned by a Lieutenant or Praetor. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his 16. booke &s;aith, that in this iland were nine good|ly cities, which had their &s;euerall petie Kings, by whom they were gouerned; all notwith&s;tanding &s;ubiect to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Inferiour townes al&s;o were commanded by their proper Kings.</P>
<P>But that the fertility of this ile may better appeare, I thinke it good to &s;et downe that commendation of <HI>Am|mianus Marcellinus,</HI> which he hath left behind him of it; <HI>Cyprus,</HI> &s;aith he, is &s;o fertile and aboundeth with &s;uch va|riety of all things, that without the help of any forrein commodities, only of them&s;elues it is able to build a &s;hip from the keel to the toppe &s;aile, and &s;end it to the &s;ea ridged and furni&s;hed with all things nece&s;&s;ary what&s;oeuer. <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> al&s;o hath the&s;e words of it; <HI>Cyprus;</HI> famous for wealth and great riches, tempted the poore and needy Romanes to inuade it, &s;o that we held the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of that iland iniu&s;tly and rather for gaine, then for any right we had vnto it. But this, &ocirc; <HI>Rufus,</HI> is not, as they &s;ay, mercenary commendation of the Roman valour.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the ancient writers, <HI>Strabo, Mela,</HI> and other Geographers haue de&s;cribed this Iland: Of the latter, <HI>Benedictus Bordonius</HI> in his treati&s;e of Ilands: <HI>Vadianus, Pius</HI> the &s;econd Pope of <HI>Rome, Domin. Niger, Sabellicus, Vola|terran,</HI> and <HI>Iacobus Zieglerus</HI> pa&s;sing well: <HI>Stephanus Lu&s;ignanus,</HI> hath in the French tongue written a peculiar booke of this Iland.</P>

<HEAD>STALAMINE, &s;ometime called LEMNOS.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_LEmnos,</HI> an Iland of the Aegean &s;ea, lieth ouer again&s;t <HI>Thrace, (Romania)</HI> between the Penin&s;ula or Neck-land of <HI>Thrace,</HI> and the mount <HI>Athon</HI> of <HI>Macedonie.</HI> Famous long &s;ince for <HI>Vulcanes</HI> &s;hoppe, and now as much talked of for the medicinall earth (which of the Phy&s;itions is called <HI>Terra Lemnia</HI>) that heere is digged out. At this day this ile, is called of the Turks and Italians, <HI>Stalamine.</HI> It is 100. miles about, as <HI>Bordonius</HI> affirmeth: And is a plaine and champion country, in re&s;pect of the Ilands round about it. On the Ea&s;t &s;ide, as <HI>Bellonius</HI> reporteth, it is leane and no good corne ground: between the South and We&s;t parts, where it is more moi&s;t, it is much more fertile. Anciently it had two cities, <HI>Myrina</HI> and <HI>Ephe&s;tias:</HI> this latter is wholly de&s;ert and not inhabited, is now called <HI>Cochino.</HI> That at this day is a towne of &s;mall account, &s;ituate in a Demy-ile or Penin&s;ula, ioined to the Iland by a narrow necke or I&s;thmos; at this day it is called <HI>Lemno.</HI> In this iland, as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth, there was a Labyrinth, the third in e&s;timation from that of <HI>Aegypt.</HI> But <HI>Bellonius</HI> narrowly &s;ee|king for his foundation, could not find any mention of it: nor any of the country that could &s;hew him any more then certaine pieces of it. The &s;ame authour affirmeth that there are yet remaining in it 75. villages. The earth which anciently was called <HI>Sphragida</HI> and <HI>Terra Lemnia,</HI> commonly <HI>Terra &s;igillata,</HI> is now, (as in old time it was wont) digged out of the ground not without a certaine kind of &s;uper&s;titious ceremony, euery yeare vpon the &s;ixth day of Augu&s;t; and at no time els. For vpon paine of death, it is decreed that no man either priuately or openly &s;hall go thither to digge out ought. The place where it is digged out, they call <HI>Vulcanes mount.</HI> Of the kinds of hearbs, &s;erpents, and fi&s;hes which are heere very common: and of the ceremonies and with what adoe the earth, that is called <HI>Terra Lemnia,</HI> is taken out of the ground, and of diuers other peculiar things of this iland, read the fir&s;t booke of <HI>P. Bellonius</HI> his Ob&s;eruations. <HI>Andreas Matthiolus</HI> al&s;o, out of the letters of <HI>Albacarius,</HI> vnto <HI>Angerius Busbechius,</HI> hath a curious de&s;cription and di&s;cour&s;e of the ceremonies v&s;ed in the digging out of <HI>Terra &s;i|gillata,</HI> in tho&s;e his learned commentaries vpon <HI>Dio&s;corides.</HI> Of this al&s;o read <HI>Hodoeporicum Bizantium Hugoris Fa|uolij.</HI> He that de&s;ireth the old ceremonies of digging out of the &s;ame, let him haue recour&s;e to <HI>Galen</HI> his nienth booke and &s;econd chapter, <HI>De Medicam. &s;implic.</HI></P>

<HEAD>GREECE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_GReece,</HI> which &s;ometime was as it were the mother and nurce of all good learning and di&s;ci|plines, of a rich and wealthy country, and which by his valour and magnanimity was Em|pre&s;&s;e &amp; Prince of the better halfe of the world, is at this day driuen to that &s;tate (&s;uch is the mutability and vncon&s;tancy of fortune, which turneth all things vp&s;ide downe) that there is no part of it but either it is &s;ubiect to the Turke and enthralled to his &s;laui&s;h &s;eruitude, or els it is vnder the command of the Venetians, or tributary to them. The Turke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the greater part: the Venetians do only enioy certaine ilands in that &s;ea. Tho&s;e which are vnder the Venetian gouernment are in better &s;tate, in re&s;pect of Religion, than tho&s;e which are &s;ubiect to the Turke. Tho&s;e which are vnder the obedience of the Turke, do conforme them&s;elues to their maners, as likewi&s;e tho&s;e which are commanded of the Venetians; doe imitate the behauiour of the Venetians. Yet all of them do liue in &s;uch great darkene&s;&s;e of ignorant blindne&s;&s;e, that in all <HI>Greece</HI> now there is not one Vniuer&s;ity or &s;choole of liberall &s;ciences: neither are they de&s;irous to haue their chil|dren taught &s;o much as to write and read. And all of them generally do &s;peake their ancient language, but much cor|rupted, although &s;ome of them do &s;peake more purely then others. Yet their moderne language doth come more neere to the old Greeke, then the Italian to the Roman or Latin tongue. Tho&s;e which dwell in cities &s;ubiect to the Venetian iuri&s;diction, do &s;peake Greeke and Italian: but the country people only Greeke: tho&s;e which dwell in cities comman|ded by the Turke, do &s;peake Greeke and the Turki&s;h tongues; tho&s;e in the villages and vpland places, only Greeke. They haue al&s;o at this day, as (al&s;o they had in former ages) diuers and different dialects; for the people of one prouince do &s;peake more pure; they of another &s;hire more barbarou&s;ly and rudely: whereupon that happeneth to this country, which is incident to other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> that one doth mocke and &s;coffe anothers pronunciation, which to his eares &s;eemeth rude and clowni&s;h: &s;o that the Boies of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> do mocke and laugh at the forreners; for their pronun|ciation and diuers accenting of words different from them. Much like as the Italian, which &s;peaketh the Tu&s;cane: or the French which &s;peaketh French: or the Spaniard, which &s;peaketh the Ca&s;tillian languages, do flout and hi&s;&s;e at tho&s;e which are brought vp in other countries of the &s;ame kingdomes.</P>
<P>But that we may &s;et out in the be&s;t maner the whole cour&s;e of life of this nation, I thinke it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h the Nobility and citizens from the common people and ba&s;er &s;ort of men: for they which are of greater reuenews and of better credit, do v&s;e the habit and fa&s;hion of apparell of tho&s;e Princes to whom they are &s;ubiect, &s;o that tho&s;e which are gouerned by the Venetians, do imitate the Venetians: tho&s;e that are &s;ubiect to the Turke, the Turkes. But the com|mon people vnder who&s;e iuri&s;diction &s;o euer, a&s;well within the maine land, as the ilanders, do yet retaine &s;omething of the old cu&s;tomes of the Greeks: for, for the mo&s;t part all of them do weare the haire of their head long behind, and &s;hort before: and do v&s;e great double cappes. The Ilanders in the forme of diuine &s;eruice, all of them both in rites and ceremonies, a&s;well as in Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall gouernment, do not any whit vary one from another. All the Greeks general|ly, after the Turkes maner, haue not much hou&s;hold &s;tuffe, neither do they lie vpon feather-beds, but in &s;teed of them they v&s;e certaine pillowes, &s;tuffed with flocks or wooll. All of them do hate delaied wine, that is, wine mingled with water, and to this day they keepe their old cu&s;tome of carou&s;ing and liberall kind of drinking, e&s;pecially the Creets. Yet in this they differ from the Germanes; in that the&s;e prouoke one another to drinke whole cuppes, tho&s;e do &s;ippe and drinke, &s;maller draughts. Whereupon <HI>Graecari,</HI> was then (and now &s;till is) v&s;ed, for <HI>Inebriari,</HI> to be drunken. But becau&s;e that in drinking they v&s;e certaine lawes or ceremonies, I cannot pa&s;&s;e them ouer with &s;ilence. Fir&s;t, their tables are very low, and they drinke by turnes, no man euer skipping his cour&s;e: &s;o that if any man &s;hall call for wine out of order, that is, before his turne come about, it is held for a very vnmannerly part. He that can fill wine be&s;t, holdeth the wine potte, and he alone filleth out for the re&s;t in order as it commeth to their cour&s;e. In tho&s;e their drinkings they v&s;e a certaine little kind of gla&s;&s;e without a foote, &s;o that it cannot be &s;et downe but euery man mu&s;t drinke all out, and may not leaue one drop in the gla&s;&s;e. Sometime they challenge one another to drinke after the Dutch fa&s;hion, and then they embrace one another, and hold hands, and one ki&s;&s;eth the hand of him to whom he drinketh, and fir&s;t layeth it vpon his forehead, then he &s;troaketh and ki&s;&s;eth both his cheeks: but in this kind of drinking they ob&s;erue no order as afore. And becau&s;e they drinke a very &s;trong wine, and that in &s;mall draughts, and &s;o do heate them&s;elues very much, they haue alwaies by them a great tankerd full of water, whereof they drinke euery foote large draughts to coole them|&s;elues againe: for otherwi&s;e they &s;hould &s;car&s;ely be able to alay their thir&s;t. No women may be pre&s;ent at their drinke|ings. The old cu&s;tome v&s;ed of the heathen of mourning for the dead, is &s;till ob&s;erued at this day all ouer <HI>Greece,</HI> and countries neere adioining: which is a very fooli&s;h maner: for as &s;oone as one is dead, the women meet together in a certaine place; and at the breake of day they begin a kind of lamentation or howling, &s;triking their brea&s;ts, tearing their cheekes, twiching and pulling their haire, they keep a pitifull and ruefull adoe to &s;ee to. And that the&s;e ceremonies may be done more &s;olemnely, they hire one woman aboue the re&s;t with a mo&s;t &s;hrill loud voice, to lead the re&s;t and guide their voices, that their re&s;ts, or pau&s;es as they call them, and the accents may better be di&s;tingui&s;hed: and in this mourn|full &s;ong they &s;et out the prai&s;es and vertuous qualities of the party decea&s;&s;ed, from his cradle euen to the la&s;t houre of his death. &amp;c. The&s;e we haue taken out of the fir&s;t booke of <HI>P. Bellonius</HI> his ob&s;eruations, where thou maie&s;t &s;ee many things more worth the noting.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the old writers, <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> de&s;cribed this country, but <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> more curiou&s;ly and with greater di|ligence.

<P><HI>_ILlyricum,</HI> or, (which plea&s;eth others better) <HI>Illyris,</HI> is a country vpon the coa&s;t of the Hadri|aticke &s;ea, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Italy.</HI> The bounds of this prouince according to diuers authours, are diuers. For <HI>Pliny</HI> doth a&s;&s;igne it but a narrow roome between the riuers <HI>Ar&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Titius.</HI> And <HI>Ptolemey</HI> he extendeth the confines of it as farre, namely from <HI>Hi&s;tria,</HI> vp as high as <HI>Macedonia,</HI> all along by the &s;ea coa&s;t: and his vpland or more inner parts, he maketh to reach euen vnto the skirts of <HI>Pannonia</HI> and <HI>Moe&s;ia</HI> the higher. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius Ale|xandrinus</HI> do yet make it farre greater, a&s;cribing to <HI>Illyricum</HI> all that tract of the Hadriaticke &s;ea that is between <HI>Terge&s;tum</HI> and <HI>Montes Ceraunij,</HI> and affirmeth withall that the <HI>Illyrij</HI> do dwell beyond the riuer <HI>Danaw.</HI> For <HI>Mela</HI> doth account the riuer <HI>Danaw</HI> among&s;t the riuers of <HI>Illyricum. Strabo</HI> al&s;o in his &s;euenth booke of his Geography, &s;aith that the <HI>Illyrij,</HI> do border vpon <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thracia.</HI> But <HI>Appianus Alexandrinus</HI> doth yet make it more large then any of tho&s;e for|mer writers: for thus he writeth of the <HI>Illyrij.</HI> The Greeks, &s;aith he, do call all tho&s;e <HI>Illyrij,</HI> which dwell between <HI>Chao|nia,</HI> and <HI>The&s;protis,</HI> (beyond <HI>Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thracia</HI>) vp as high as the riuer <HI>I&s;ter:</HI> for this is the length of this prouince. The breadth of it is the &s;pace betwixt <HI>Macedonia</HI> and the mountaines of <HI>Thrace,</HI> euen vnto <HI>Paeonia</HI> and the Ionian &s;ea, and &s;o butteh vpon the Alpes, which is about fiue daies iournies length. His length is thri&s;e as great as the breadth &amp;c. And a little after, the &s;ame authour hath the&s;e words: The Romans do generally comprehend vnder that of the <HI>Illyrij,</HI> not only tho&s;e before cited, but al&s;o the <HI>Paeones</HI> beyond them, together with the <HI>Rhoeti, Norici,</HI> and <HI>Mysij</HI> which inha|bit <HI>Europe,</HI> and what&s;oeuer Nations els do border vpon the&s;e, which they leaue vpon the right hand that &s;aile vp the riuer <HI>I&s;ter:</HI> and againe that they may di&s;tingui&s;h the Hellines from the Greekes, they call them by their &s;euerall and proper names: otherwi&s;e generally they are by one name called <HI>Illyrij:</HI> For euen from the head of the riuer <HI>I&s;ter</HI> vnto the Ponticke &s;ea, they commonly terme them <HI>Illyrici.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Appianus. Suetonius,</HI> in the life of <HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar</HI> te|&s;tifieth in like maner that the bounds of <HI>Illyricum</HI> are thus large at the left.</P>
<P><HI>Sextus Rufus,</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Emperour, a&s;cribeth &s;euenteen prouinces to <HI>Illyricum:</HI> Two of the <HI>Norici,</HI> the two <HI>Pannonies, Valeria, Sauia, Dalmatia, Moe&s;ia,</HI> the two <HI>Dacias, Macedonia, The&s;&s;alia, Achaia,</HI> two <HI>Epirus, Praeualis</HI> and <HI>Creta.</HI></P>
<P>Some do thinke that the&s;e countries were &s;o named of <HI>Illyrius</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Polyphemus:</HI> others of <HI>Illyrius</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Cadmus. Strabo</HI> writeth that all the &s;ea coa&s;t of <HI>Illyricum,</HI> with the ilands adioining, is furni&s;hed with many good ha|uens: when as contrariwi&s;e the whole coa&s;t of <HI>Italie</HI> ouer again&s;t this, hath none at all. It is a hot country, as <HI>Italy</HI> is, and very fertile of many &s;orts of graine, famous for oliues and vines: except certaine places which are altogether rough and vntoiled. The high country which is aboue this is altogether mountainous, cold and &s;nowie, e&s;pecially that which is toward the North. The country people in old time were much giuen to robberies and theeuing, but now they be &s;omewhat more ciuill. They dwell for the mo&s;t part in hou&s;es of timber, thatcht with &s;traw, excepting only a few marine cities, in which their buildings are a little better. Thus farre <HI>Strabo.</HI> Among&s;t the which the chiefe is <HI>Ragu&s;i,</HI> anciently called <HI>Epidaurus,</HI> a city famous for the Mart, a&s;well as for the politicke gouernment of their common-wealth. Not long &s;ince it was a free city, now it is tributary to the Turkes, and for that (as <HI>Nicolaus Nicolaius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth in his Ob&s;eruations) it paieth yearely to the great Turke 12000. ducates of Gold. A de&s;cription of this you may read of in the tenth booke of <HI>Martin Barlet</HI> of the life of <HI>Scanderbeg.</HI></P>
<P>Thus farre generally of <HI>Illyricum:</HI> now I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to &s;peake &s;omething of this our Mappe which doth not comprehend all <HI>Illyricum</HI> according to the iudgement of the forenamed authours, <HI>Pliny</HI> only excepted who doth re&s;traine the bounds of it, as we &s;aid, into a more narrow roome. There are in this Chart <HI>Hi&s;tria, Slauonia, Dalmatia, Bo&s;nia, Carinthia,</HI> part of <HI>Carniola,</HI> and part of <HI>Stiria:</HI> all almo&s;t tributary vnto the kingdome of <HI>Hungary,</HI> except a few prouinces abuttant vpon the &s;ea, which belong to the Venetians. The Turke hath &s;ubdued the greate&s;t part of them to his obedience. All which countries almo&s;t are de&s;cribed in their &s;euerall Tables in this our Theater, and therefore in this place we &s;peake nothing at all of them. Only I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to adde this one &s;tory of <HI>Stiria,</HI> That this country doth breed tho&s;e <HI>Strumo&s;i,</HI> that is, a kind of people &s;ubiect to wennes, and that there are often &s;eene &s;ome with &s;uch huge great wennes, that they do hinder their &s;peach: and a woman giuing &s;ucke (as <HI>Aubanus</HI> writeth) doth ca&s;t it ouer her &s;houlder like a &s;acke or wallet, lea&s;t it &s;hould let the child from taking the brea&s;t. And indeed we in the yeare 1558. iournied from <HI>Fri&s;ach</HI> by <HI>Vienna</HI> to <HI>Venice,</HI> where we &s;aw to our great admiration, a man who&s;e chin beginning at his eares was almo&s;t as broade as from &s;houlder to &s;houlder, and hung downe euen to his brea&s;t. I &s;ay, not without great admiration, again&s;t that of <HI>Inuenall, Quis tumidum guttur miretur in Alpibus?</HI> It is no wonder great, to &s;ee the wenne among&s;t the Alpes. They commonly attribute the cau&s;e of the wenne to the water and aire which heere the inhabitants do v&s;e, and draw into their bodies. <HI>Rithmaimer</HI> this country-man borne, in his treati&s;e of the &s;ituation of the World, hath a peculiar de&s;cription of <HI>Stiria.</HI> Of <HI>Bo&s;ina</HI> read <HI>D. Chytraeus</HI> his Chronicle of <HI>Saxony.</HI> Of the&s;e Illyrians read more at large in <HI>Dominicus Niger, Volaterran,</HI> and <HI>Lewis Verger</HI> in the Co&s;mography of <HI>Seba&s;ti|an Mun&s;ter,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Laonicus Chalcondylas,</HI> who in his tenth booke <HI>Notiliar,</HI> hath written &s;omething of this countrie worth the reading. All this tract, except tho&s;e &s;hires which border vpon <HI>Germanie,</HI> doth &s;peake the Slauonian tongue: which, (that I may &s;ay &s;omething of it by the way) of &s;ome is now called <HI>Windi&s;h,</HI> was thought to be that, which the Latines called <HI>Lingua Illyrica,</HI> the Illyrian tongue, and at this day is very farre &s;pread, as being generally &s;po|ken of all the nations inhabiting between the Gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the North &s;ea. For the inhabitants of <HI>I&s;tria, Dal|matia, Bo&s;na, Morauia, Bohemia, Lu&s;atia, Polonia, Lithuania, Pruthenia, Scandinauia, Bulgaria,</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;sia</HI> that wide and large kingdome, and many other neighbour counrries, vp as high almo&s;t as <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> do &s;peake that tongue; &s;o that it is al&s;o much v&s;ed among&s;t the Turkes:</P>

<HEAD>The Dukedome of CARINTHIA, or KARNTEN, and the County Palatine of GORCZ.</HEAD>
<P>_THis Dukedome of <HI>Carinthia,</HI> (which as <HI>Rithmayer</HI> affirmeth &s;hould rather be written <HI>Carnithia</HI>) hath vpon the Ea&s;t and North <HI>Steyrmarcke,</HI> vpon the We&s;t and South the Alpes and <HI>Friuli. Carniola</HI> is part of this prouince. In this country are many valleies and hilles very good wheat grounds: many Lakes and Riuers; among&s;t the which the chiefe is <HI>Drauus,</HI> or as they now call it <HI>Dra.</HI> The more fa|mous cities of this tract are, <HI>S. Veit, Villach,</HI> and <HI>Clagenfurt. S. Veit</HI> the Metropolitane city, is a city of good note, hauing a very faire large market place, wherein &s;tandeth a goodly conduite of running wa|ter, which we &s;aw in building in the yeare 1558. The diameter or breadth of the ce&s;terne we tooke to be about &s;euen foote ouer. This ce&s;terne made of one whole &s;tone of white marble, and there a|mong&s;t other monuments of antiquity digged out of the ground, was a thing worth the &s;eeing. As they go out of the city toward <HI>Clagen-furt,</HI> there is a very wide champion that offereth it &s;elfe, as yet be&s;trewed with many ruines of ancient buildings, they commonly call it <HI>Solfeldt: Paracel&s;us</HI> in that his Chronicle of this coun|try (if &s;o be it be his) nameth it, I cannot tell vpon what ground, <HI>Liburnia.</HI> I do rather iudge <HI>Soluen&s;e oppidum,</HI> the towne <HI>Solue,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> maketh mention of in <HI>Carina,</HI> to haue long &s;ince &s;tood heere. This is that place, where the princes are wont to be crowned abroad in the open aire, a &s;trange and vnu&s;uall kind of ceremony curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed by <HI>Pius</HI> the &s;econd, in his <HI>Europa. Villach,</HI> a towne, who&s;e hou&s;es in their forefront gorgeou&s;ly painted and &s;et out with hi&s;tories and variety of colours yeeld a beau|tifull and goodly &s;hew to the beholders. It is &s;eated vpon the riuer <HI>Dra,</HI> in a plaine, enclo&s;ed with very high &s;teepe rocks, with a great &s;tone bridge ouer the riuer. <HI>Clagen-furt,</HI> a &s;trong city anciently called, as <HI>Lazius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, <HI>Claudia.</HI> Some there are that write, that the citizens of this city are &s;o hardly bent again&s;t theeues, that vpon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of &s;u&s;picion of theft a man &s;hall there without examination be hanged, and then the third day after that he is hanged, they &s;itte vpon the triall; if &s;o be that they find him to haue been vniu&s;tly executed, they bury him very honourably: if iu&s;tly, they let him hang &s;till. But <HI>Rithmayer</HI> &s;aith, that this is but a meere fable. Moreouer <HI>Fri&s;ach,</HI> a very ancient towne <HI>S. Lionhart, Wolf&s;perg, &amp;c.</HI> are townes al&s;o of this coun|try. In former times the <HI>Iapydes</HI> were thought to haue dwelt heere abouts. The &s;oueraignty and &s;ecular iuri&s;diction of this coun|try doth belong vnto the Dukes of <HI>Au&s;trich:</HI> but as concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall iuri&s;diction it partly belongeth to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Salczburg,</HI> and partly to the Patriarch of <HI>Aquileia,</HI> as <HI>Paracel&s;us</HI> affirmeth in his forecited Chronicle. But in the &s;ame place he hath a mo&s;t ridiculous etymologie of the name of this prouince, which he faineth to be fetched from the Latines, namely, that it &s;hould be named <HI>Carinthia,</HI> as who would &s;ay, <HI>Caritas intima,</HI> Intire loue and affection. As if the fir&s;t inhabitants who &s;eated them&s;elues heere &s;hould haue been de&s;irous to haue their country named by a name fetcht from a forrein nation and &s;trange lan|guage, not vnder&s;tood of them. The Reader not &s;atisfied with this heere &s;et downe by vs, let him haue recour&s;e vnto <HI>Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter, Sabellicus, Pio</HI> II. &amp;c.

<P><HI>Goritiae palatinatus,</HI> The county palatine of <HI>Gorcz,</HI> belonging to the Duke of <HI>Au&s;trich,</HI> is &s;o named of <HI>Goercz,</HI> the chiefe city of this country, called of the Italians (for it &s;tandeth in <HI>Italie</HI> beyond the Alpes) <HI>Goricia,</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey Iulium Carnicum,</HI> as <HI>Leander</HI> thinketh. <HI>Ama&s;aeus,</HI> as the &s;ame <HI>Leander</HI> &s;aith, gathereth by diuers antiquities heere found and remaining, that <HI>Noteia</HI> &s;ometime was &s;eated heere about.

The whole country is not very leuell and plaine, yet the mountaines are neither very high, &s;teep nor barren, but plentifully repleni&s;hed with vines, oliues, and other fruit-trees, corne, pa&s;tures and cattell: only in that part which bendeth toward the bay, <HI>Golfo di Quernero,</HI> &s;ometime called <HI>Flanatico</HI> or <HI>Fanatico,</HI> it hath a very high mountaine, which they commonly call <HI>Monte maior.</HI> This fir&s;t pre&s;enteth it &s;elfe to the eie of the &s;eamen which &s;aile hither|ward; in who&s;e toppe there ari&s;eth a very goodly &s;pring of fre&s;h-water. It yeeldeth many rare hearbs and plants of &s;ingular ver|tues, which do make Phy&s;itions, farre dwellers from hence, to re&s;ort hither in time of the yeare, and with great toile and danger to clamber vp the &s;ame. The riuers of <HI>Hi&s;tria</HI> are three, <HI>Fornio, Naupertus</HI> and <HI>Ar&s;ia:</HI> the fir&s;t the country people call <HI>Ri&s;ano:</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Quieto:</HI> the la&s;t <HI>Ar&s;a,</HI> which falleth into the bay <HI>Quernero</HI> or <HI>Fanatico,</HI> and is now the vtmo&s;t bound of <HI>Italie.</HI> The ci|ties of <HI>Hi&s;tria</HI> are <HI>Mugia, Iu&s;tinopolis, I&s;ola, Pitano,</HI> (or <HI>Piran</HI> as I thinke it is named in the mappe) <HI>Pumago, Hemonia, Parenzo, O|&s;ara, Rubino, Pola, S.

<P><HI>_HVngaria,</HI> (which it is certaine was &s;o named of the <HI>Hunni</HI> or <HI>Hungari,</HI> a people come out of <HI>Scythia,</HI> which now inhabit it) conteineth almo&s;t both the Panno|nies, the countries of the <HI>Iaziges,</HI> and the <HI>Daci,</HI> now comprehending <HI>Tran&s;&s;ylua|nia, VValachria</HI> and <HI>Moldauia.</HI> On the South it beginneth at the riuer <HI>Dra:</HI> on the North it is bounded by <HI>Sarmatia Europaea,</HI> now called <HI>Polonia;</HI> and <HI>Getia,</HI> at this day named <HI>VValagria:</HI> on the We&s;t it hath <HI>Au&s;trich,</HI> &s;ometime the head of the Higher <HI>Pannonia:</HI> vpon the Ea&s;t it is confined with <HI>My&s;ia,</HI> which at this day they call <HI>Rhetia. Donaw (Danubius)</HI> of all the riuers of <HI>Europe</HI> by farre the greate&s;t, run|neth through the midde&s;t of it, and &s;o diuideth it into two parts, the Heather and the Farder. The HEATHER HVNGARIA, is that which formerly were the Pannonies, the Vpper and Neather: this is &s;euered from the further <HI>Hungaria</HI> by the riuer <HI>Dra:</HI> from <HI>Au&s;trich</HI> and <HI>Bayern,</HI> by the foote of the mount <HI>Caecius;</HI> from <HI>Slauonia</HI> by <HI>Dra:</HI> from <HI>Bo&s;na</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;cia,</HI> by <HI>Saw.</HI> The head and chiefe cities of this part is <HI>Buda,</HI> (often they call it) the imperiall &s;eat of their kings. Other townes of great account are, <HI>Alba Regalis, (Stulwei&s;&s;enburg)</HI> famous for the coronation and tombes of their kings; <HI>Strigonium, (Gran)</HI> the Metropolitan or Archbi&s;hops &s;ea, <HI>Quinqueeccle&s;iae (Fun&s;kirchen,</HI> the Turkes call it <HI>Pet&s;cheu)</HI> a bi&s;hop|ricke; <HI>Sopronium, Taurunum</HI> (the Germanes call it <HI>Griechwei&s;&s;enburg,</HI> the Hungarians, <HI>Nandor alba;</HI> the Ita|lians <HI>Belgrado:) Sabaria, (Zombatel)</HI> or <HI>Szombath hely</HI>) the place where S. <HI>Martine</HI> was borne: and <HI>Stridon, (Sdrigna,)</HI> the natiue &s;oile of S. <HI>Hierome.</HI> It hath many goodly riuers; and two very famous lakes, <HI>(Ba|laton)</HI> and <HI>(Fertou).</HI> To this part of <HI>Hungary,</HI> as &s;oone as thou art ouer the riuer <HI>Dra,</HI> is annexed <HI>Slauonia,</HI> &s;ometime a part of the vpper <HI>Pannonie,</HI> lying between the riuers <HI>Saw</HI> and <HI>Dra;</HI> although indeed it doth extend it &s;elfe farre beyond the <HI>Saw,</HI> as farre as the riuer <HI>Huna,</HI> (for &s;o it is at this day called) where <HI>Cro|atia</HI> beginneth. After it followeth <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> coa&s;ting along by the Hadriaticke &s;ea, partly &s;ubiect to the Turke, partly to the Venetian. The lea&s;t part of it now is vnder the king of <HI>Hungaria:</HI> the vpland country is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Bozners,</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;cians,</HI> which anciently were called <HI>Moe&s;i &s;uperiores.</HI> The chiefe city of <HI>Slauonia</HI> is <HI>(Zagrabia)</HI> of <HI>Croatia, (Bigihon)</HI> is now, but in former ages <HI>Fumium</HI> was the chiefe. The FARTHER HVNGARY, or <HI>Hungary</HI> beyond <HI>Donaw,</HI> is &s;euered from <HI>Morauia, Sile&s;ia, Polonia,</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;cia</HI> by the <HI>montes Carpathij,</HI> (called now by the Germanes <HI>(Schneberg)</HI> which do begin a little aboue <HI>Po&s;onium, (Presburgh)</HI> and from thence by many long and tedious windings, pa&s;&s;e between this coun|try vntill they end at the <HI>Euxine</HI> &s;ea or <HI>Marmaiore,</HI> at that place where there is the country which now they call <HI>Maromaru&s;ia.</HI> There now other mountaines and woods, from that place bending toward <HI>Se|uerinum,</HI> a city &s;ituate vpon <HI>Donaw,</HI> do diuide it from <HI>Tran&s;&s;yluania</HI> and <HI>VValachria tran&s;alpina.</HI> The riuer <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> well &s;tored with diuers &s;orts of fi&s;h, ari&s;ing out of the mountaines of <HI>Maromaru&s;ia,</HI> runneth through the midde&s;t part of <HI>Hungary.</HI> It hath many goodly townes, as <HI>Po&s;onium, (Presburg) Tirnauia, (Dijru) &amp;c.</HI> on the We&s;t: <HI>Colacia, Bachia, Zegedinum, (Zeged,) &amp;c.</HI> on the South: <HI>Varadinum, Dedrecinum, &amp;c.</HI> beyond the riuer <HI>Tibi&s;cus,</HI> where al&s;o are the mines of gold and &s;iluer; At <HI>Seuerinum,</HI> is yet to be &s;een a mention of the bridge, long &s;ince built by <HI>Traiane</HI> the Emperour, and other townes and things worth the remembrance, which in this place, the &s;hortne&s;&s;e of our entended di&s;cour&s;e doth force me to omit.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants do &s;peake the Scythian language, a tongue much different from any language &s;poken by any of their neighbours round about them. It giueth place to no country of the World, for valiant and &s;tout men; &s;tore of cattell, fertility of &s;oile, and rich veines of mettalls: but for tempera|ture of the aire, whole&s;ome and plea&s;ant &s;ituation, it may iu&s;tly be preferred before any what&s;oeuer that I know. The earth is plentifully endowed by nature with all maner of things nece&s;&s;ary and com|modious: Gold, Siluer, Salt, Precious-&s;tones, Mineralls for colours are heere digged vp in great abun|dance. It yeeldeth great &s;tore of corne, graine, fodder for cattell, apples and fruites of diuers &s;orts. They haue many riuers well &s;tored with fre&s;h fi&s;h. They haue great plenty of Coppar. In the mo&s;t of their riuers there are often found certaine &s;hiuers of the be&s;t and fine&s;t gold: yea euen in their vines, (&s;uch is the nature of this golden &s;oile) they do extract great plenty of Gold.</P>
<P>This we haue gathered out of the little treati&s;e of <HI>Steeuen Broderith,</HI> and the Decades of <HI>Hungary</HI> writ|ten by <HI>Antony Bonfinius:</HI> to whom the &s;tudious Reader for further &s;atisfaction may haue recour&s;e.

<P>_THis &s;econd de&s;cription of <HI>Hungary</HI> more exact and true, as the famous learned man <HI>Iohn Sambuke,</HI> this countrie|man borne, maketh me beleeue, (for euery man, as <HI>Pli|ny</HI> in his Naturall hi&s;tory mo&s;t truely witne&s;&s;eth, de|&s;cribeth the plot and &s;ituation of the country be&s;t where|in he him&s;elfe was bred and borne) we haue thought good in this place to adioine vnto the former, and that be&s;ide our purpo&s;e: when as our promi&s;e was of ech countrie, to &s;et out but one Mappe. But becau&s;e I thinke neither of them to be of it &s;elfe ab&s;olute inough for the worth of this &s;o goodly a country, I haue thought it behouefull to the Reader, to &s;et out both in this our Theater. He that &s;hall compare them one with the other, &s;hall find oft times great variety in the &s;ituation of places, and turnings and windings of the &s;treames and riuers: and yet there is no rea|&s;on why pre&s;ently any man &s;hould condemne the authours of want of skill or diligence in de&s;cribing it: but let him iudge of it, as <HI>Strabo</HI> mo&s;t truely doth of Hi&s;tory: for he doth not by and by thinke that hi&s;tory to be reiected, when they that haue &s;et it forth, do not altogether agree in the de&s;criptions of places: when as the truth of the whole hi&s;tory is many times by that di&s;agreement more plainly demon&s;trated. Let therefore the diligent Reader and &s;tudent of Geography, for who&s;e good we do what&s;oeuer we po&s;sibly can, v&s;e one or both at his di&s;cretion, &s;eeing that we are forced to do what we may, not what we would.</P>

<P><HI>_STeuen Broderith,</HI> in his Treati&s;e printed at <HI>Ba&s;ill,</HI> together with the Hungarian hi|&s;tory of <HI>Antony Bonfinius,</HI> de&s;cribeth this country thus: <HI>Tran&s;siluania,</HI> &s;aith he, was &s;ometime a part of <HI>Dacia.</HI> His chiefe city is <HI>Alba Iulia, (Wei&s;&s;enburg)</HI> &s;o called ei|ther of <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar,</HI> or rather of <HI>Hiula</HI> a certaine prince of the Hunnes. It hath many other goodly townes, among&s;t the which are <HI>Cibinum, (Herman&s;tadt)</HI> called of the Hungarians <HI>(Seben)</HI> &s;ituate vpon the riuer <HI>Cibin, Bra&s;&s;ouia, (Chron&s;tadt) Co|lo&s;ium, (Clau&s;enburg) Bi&s;tricia, (Be&s;tereze)</HI> and many other built and inhabited by a people of high <HI>Germany,</HI> which we call Saxons. In this country are the <HI>Siculi,</HI> a fierce and warlike Nation: among&s;t which there is neither clowne, nor gentleman, all men are in de|gree equall, like as among&s;t the Switzers <HI>Tran&s;siluania</HI> is very fertile of all maner of things, e&s;pecially of Gold, Siluer, and other mettalls; as al&s;o of Salt digged out of mountaines. It breedeth excellent Hor|&s;es, and hath great plenty of Wine, although not &s;o good as <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Slauonia.</HI> The two Walachies <HI>VValachia Tran&s;alpina, Walachie</HI> beyond the mountaines, and <HI>Moldauia,</HI> do enclo&s;e <HI>Tran&s;siluania:</HI> that re&s;t|eth vpon the riuer <HI>Donaw,</HI> this vpon the Euxine &s;ea, or <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> as the Italians call it; both of them together with <HI>Tran&s;siluania</HI> do now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e that part of <HI>Europe,</HI> which anciently was called DACIA. Thus that whole tract beyond <HI>Donaw,</HI> which doth not only conteine the higher <HI>Hungary,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>Tran&s;siluania</HI> together with both the Walachies, is enclo&s;ed round on euery &s;ide with <HI>Donaw,</HI> the Car|pathian hills, (<HI>Crapacke,</HI> as &s;ome thinke) the Euxine &s;ea, and againe with the &s;ame <HI>Donaw.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Broderith.</HI></P>
<P>But I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to &s;et downe heere the de&s;cription of it out of <HI>Antony Bonfinius</HI> his I. decade of the fir&s;t booke of his hi&s;tory of <HI>Hungary.</HI> Beyond the Carpathian mountaines, &s;aith he, is the vtter|mo&s;t prouince of <HI>Dacia,</HI> extended euen vnto the riuer <HI>Axiaces.</HI> This now vulgarly is knowen by the name of TRANSSILVANIA, they call it <HI>Sibenburghen,</HI> the Hungarians <HI>Herdel.</HI> It is a mo&s;t fertile coun|try of cattell, wine, and corne: al&s;o of Gold and Siluer: where certaine riuers do driue downe &s;hiuers of Gold, and pieces &s;ometime of a pound and an halfe weight; being euery way round be&s;et with &s;teep hills in maner of a crownet. In the woods are kine or beeues with long manes like hor&s;es; buffs and wild hor&s;es, both very &s;wift and light in running: but the hor&s;es haue long manes hanging down to the very ground: tho&s;e which are tame and brought vp for &s;eruice, naturally haue a very fine ea&s;ie kind of amble. This country is inhabited partly by Scythians, partly by the Saxones and Dakes: the&s;e are more humane and ciuill, tho&s;e more rude and churli&s;h. In old time before the breaking in of the Gothes and Hunnes, all <HI>Dacia</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Roman and Sarmatian colonies, <HI>&amp;c. George</HI> of <HI>Reichter&s;dorff</HI> hath de&s;cribed this country in a peculiar Treati&s;e. See al&s;o <HI>George Rithaymer, Peter Rantzan, Pius</HI> the &s;econd in his de&s;cription of <HI>Europe, Iohn Auentine,</HI> and <HI>Martine Cromer</HI> in his twelfth booke of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Poland.</HI> This country vulgarly is called <HI>Sibenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Zip&s;erland,</HI> as <HI>Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter</HI> hath giuen out. More of the knowledge and di&s;couery of this prouince are to be &s;ought for, in the fir&s;t chapter and &s;econd &s;ection of the twelfth booke of <HI>Wolfangus Lazius</HI> his Romane common-wealth, and in <HI>Laonicus</HI> his fifth booke: La&s;tly, in the protrepticke oration of <HI>Iohn Cu&s;pinian.</HI></P>

<P><HI>_POlonia</HI> or <HI>Poland,</HI> &s;o named of the champion plaines of the &s;oile, (which yet in their language they vulgarly call <HI>Pole</HI>) is a va&s;t and wide country, on the We&s;t bordering vpon <HI>Schle&s;ia,</HI> on the other &s;ides it re&s;teth vpon <HI>Hungaria, Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;sia.</HI> It is diuided into the Greater and the Le&s;&s;er. The <HI>Greater Poland,</HI> is that which lieth toward the We&s;t, and conteineth the goodly cities <HI>Gue&s;na</HI> and <HI>Po&s;nauia.</HI> The <HI>Le&s;&s;er Poland</HI> lieth toward the South, and hath the famous city <HI>Cracow,</HI> &s;eated vpon the head of the riuer <HI>Vi&s;tula,</HI> (the Germanes call it <HI>De Wixel,</HI> the Polanders <HI>Drwencza,</HI>) which runneth through the midde&s;t of the country: the o|ther cities are not very great nor beautifull. Their hou&s;es for the mo&s;t part are all built of &s;tone, and &s;ome are dawbed with clay. The country is very moori&s;h, full of fens and woodes. The common drinke the people v&s;e is Beere: wine they &s;eldome drinke, neither do they know how to dre&s;&s;e and manure the vine. They are counted excellent Hor&s;emen for &s;eruice in the warres. The &s;oile is fertile, they haue many heards of cattell, many deere, game and pa&s;time for the Noblemen. It hath great plenty of Hony. Salt heere is digged out of the earth in great abundance. In the mountaines which they in their language call <HI>Tatri,</HI> they haue mines of Bra&s;&s;e and Brim&s;tone. <HI>Cromer</HI> writeth, that the Polanders are of the Hungars called <HI>Lengel,</HI> of <HI>Leech</HI> the captaine or father of the Nation.</P>
<P>Vnder the kingdome of <HI>Polonia</HI> are comprehended <HI>Lithuania, Samogitia, Ma&s;ouia, Volhinia, Podolia</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;sia,</HI> which is called <HI>South-Ru&s;sia,</HI> and of &s;ome <HI>Ruthenia:</HI> as al&s;o all <HI>Pru&s;sia,</HI> except that part which hath a peculiar Duke by whom it is gouerned. <HI>Lewenclay</HI> writeth that in the yeare 1570. the king of <HI>Poland</HI> tooke the Prince of <HI>Moldauia</HI> to his protection.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of LITHVANIA, is moori&s;h and full of Bogges, for the mo&s;t part woody, and therefore not ea&s;ilie entered, trauelled or come vnto; it is better trading with the Lithuans in the winter then at other times: for that the moores and lakes being couered either with thicke ice or deep &s;now, the Marchants may pa&s;&s;e from place to place more ea&s;ily. In <HI>Lithuania</HI> there are few townes, and the villages are little inhabited. The chiefe wealth of the country people are cattell and rich skins of diuers &s;orts of wild bea&s;ts, wherewith the whole country is wonderfully &s;tored. They haue great plenty of wax and hony. This prouince breedeth the <HI>Bugle,</HI> a kind of bea&s;t which they call <HI>Suber,</HI> the Germanes <HI>Vr-ochs,</HI> &s;uch as was to be &s;eene at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> in the yeare 1570. From hence al&s;o commeth that kind of bea&s;t which the Latines call <HI>Alces,</HI> the Dutch <HI>Elandt.</HI> The people &s;peake the Slauonian tongue, like as al&s;o the Polanders do. Their chiefe city is <HI>Vilna,</HI> a Bi&s;hop &s;ea, and is as bigge as <HI>Cracow:</HI> but the hou&s;es in it do not &s;tand clo&s;e together or touch one another: but like as in the country, gardens and orchyeards are between hou&s;e and hou&s;e. All that Oke-timber which we call <HI>Wagen&s;chott,</HI> of which almo&s;t all the buildings carpenters worke, and ioiners worke, as well publicke as priuate, is made in the Low-countries, as al&s;o the greate&s;t part of their furniture and hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe, is feld in the&s;e parts, and from thence is through the Ea&s;t &s;ea, (the Latines call it <HI>Mare balticum,</HI> the Dutch <HI>Oo&s;t&s;ee,</HI> the Ru&s;sians <HI>Wareczkouie mo|rie</HI>) and Germane ocean, tran&s;ported into the&s;e countries.</P>
<P>In SAMOGITIA, (which in their language &s;ignifieth <HI>Low-land</HI>) the people are tall and of a goodly &s;tature, but rude and barbarous in their maners and behauiour, v&s;ing a &s;paring and homely diet. The Ru&s;sians call this prouince <HI>Samotz|ka&s;emla.</HI> Heere is no maner of faire buildings, but their hou&s;es are like houels or poore cottages; made of wood and couered with &s;traw or reed. From the bottome vpward by a little and little their buildings are made le&s;&s;e and le&s;&s;e, like the keele of a &s;hip, or great helmet. In the toppe it hath one window, letting in the light from aboue, vnderneath which is the hearth or chimney where they dre&s;&s;e their meat. In that hou&s;e they hide them&s;elues, their wiues, children, &s;er|uants, maides, &s;heep, cattell, corne and hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe altogether. <HI>Sichardus</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Germany</HI> writeth that the people of <HI>Samogitia</HI> are de&s;cended from the Saxons: and therefore although they be &s;ubiect to the kingdome of <HI>Polonia,</HI> yet the Saxons challenging it to be a part of their iuri&s;diction, they do affirme it to pertaine to the precinct of <HI>Saxony.</HI></P>
<P>MASOVIA, is a &s;hire held of the king of <HI>Poland,</HI> in homage. The chiefe or Metropolitane city of this prouince is <HI>War|&s;ouia,</HI> where they make the excellent mead, a kind of drinke made of hony &amp;c.</P>
<P>VOLHINIA, a country abounding with all maner of things, a very fertile &s;oile, full of townes and ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>PODOLIA, is of &s;uch a fruitfull &s;oile, that the gra&s;&s;e in three daies will couer a &s;ticke being ca&s;t into it. It is &s;o ranke and groweth &s;o fa&s;t, that a plough, being left in it vpon the head-lands or gra&s;&s;ie places of the field, in a very few daies, wilbe &s;o couered ouer that you &s;hall hardly find it againe. Heere al&s;o is great &s;tore of hony. The head city is <HI>Camyenetz.</HI></P>
<P>RVSSIA, yeeldeth great plenty of Hor&s;es, Oxen, and Sheep of very fine wooll. Their drinke is mead, which they make of hony. Wine al&s;o is brought hither from <HI>Pannonia, Moldauia</HI> and <HI>Walachria.</HI> The chiefe city of this prouince is <HI>Leunpurg,</HI> the Latines call it <HI>Leopolis,</HI> Lion-city,</P>
<P>MOLDAVIA is a part of <HI>Walachia,</HI> who&s;e metropolitane city is <HI>So&s;&s;ouia,</HI> commonly called <HI>Sot&s;chen.</HI> The inhabitants of this country are a fierce and cruell people, but very good &s;ouldiours, and therefore they are at continuall enmity with the Tran&s;siluanians. As the cu&s;tome of the Thracians was in old time to marke the Noblemens children with a hot iron: &s;o they report that the Lords of <HI>Moldauia</HI> to this day do v&s;e, to marke their children, a&s;&s;oone as they be borne, with &s;ome kind of marke: lea&s;t a que&s;tion might ari&s;e whether they were the right and lawfull heires or not: and that aliens and &s;trangers might be excluded from inheritance among&s;t them; as <HI>Reinerus Reineckius</HI> in his di&s;cour&s;e of noble families hath written. Many other things of th&s;e countries thou maie&s;t read of in <HI>Matthias</HI> of <HI>Michow</HI> in his di&s;cour&s;e of the Sar|maties, <HI>Albert Crantz</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Wandalia, Bonfinius</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Laonicus Chalcondylas</HI> in his fir&s;t and third bookes.

<P><HI>_GRomer</HI> in his de&s;cription of <HI>Poland,</HI> de&s;cribeth this country on this maner: Among&s;t many other nations of <HI>Sarmatia</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> the <HI>Boru&s;&s;i</HI> by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> are placed very farre North in that coa&s;t, where now, as I thinke, the Liuonians and Mo&s;chouites do dwell, beyond the riuer <HI>Cherni&s;h,</HI> next neighbours to the Ryphaeans. Tho&s;e, with <HI>Era&s;mus &s;tella</HI> I iudge, to haue pa&s;&s;ed further South and We&s;t and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great part of <HI>Sar|matia,</HI> which is vpon the Ea&s;t adioined to the Ru&s;sians and Mo&s;chouites, and is enclo&s;ed on the South with woods and the Hercynian forre&s;t, and all that coa&s;t along by <HI>Pautzkerwicke</HI> or <HI>Fri&s;h-haff,</HI> as &s;ome thinke, (<HI>Ptolemey</HI> calleth it <HI>Sinus Venedicus, Pliny Clylipenus</HI>) the Balticke, and Ea&s;t &s;eas, euen vnto the riuers <HI>Vi&s;tula, (Wixel</HI> or <HI>Wei&s;&s;el</HI>) and <HI>O&s;&s;a;</HI> and to be called <HI>Boru&s;&s;i</HI> or <HI>Pru&s;&s;i,</HI> by names not much different. In this compa&s;&s;e now do inhabit the Liuonians, Lithuans, Samagites, and the Prui&s;&s;en yet retaining the ancient appellation, nations di&s;tinct in re&s;pect that they are &s;ubiect to diuers &s;tates and gouerned by different lawes and policies, but v&s;ing altogether the &s;ame language vulgarly, wholly differing from the Slauonians, yet hauing diuers Latine words intermedled and mixt among, but for the mo&s;t part corrupt, and formed rather after the Italian and Spani&s;h termination, than after the Latine. Notwith&s;tanding the Dutch and Germanes of late yeares, conquering that part which lieth vpon the &s;ea, and is cal|led <HI>Sprui&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Liuonia,</HI> haue planted their colonies there. Heere hence it is that the Dutch tongue is more familiar and v&s;uall to the&s;e people, than that ancient and vulgar language, e&s;pecially in the cities and townes. Which al&s;o is v&s;uall among&s;t the Lithuans, who by rea&s;on of their neighbourhood and entercour&s;e with the Ru&s;sians, and colonies from thence enterteined, do much what &s;peake the Ru&s;sian language. For in that <HI>Duglo&s;&s;us</HI> deriueth the name and originall of this nation from <HI>Pru&s;ias</HI> the king of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> it is altogether fabulous, and not worth the confuting. Some do thinke that the <HI>Boru&s;&s;i,</HI> in the German tongue were &s;o called, for that they were neere the <HI>Ru&s;&s;i:</HI> but whether truly, or fa&s;ly I li&s;t not heere to di&s;pute. When and how the Latine tongue did intermedle it &s;elfe with the vulgar language of the Boru&s;sians, Lithuanians, and Liuonians we dare not con&s;tantly affirme. <HI>Era&s;mus Stella</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>Boru&s;&s;ia, (Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Spru&s;e</HI>) was rather a&s;&s;aulted by the Romanes, then conquered; and alleadgeth <HI>Pliny</HI> for his authour: whereupon that followeth that together with the Em|pire, the Latine tongue could not there be &s;pread and planted. But <HI>Duglo&s;&s;us</HI> he telleth vs, that in tho&s;e ciuill warres between <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Pompey,</HI> a certaine band or company of Romanes, for&s;aking <HI>Italie,</HI> their natiue country in tho&s;e trouble&s;ome times, &s;eated them&s;elues in the&s;e coa&s;ts, and to haue built a city there, and to haue called it ROMOVE, after the name of <HI>Rome</HI> their mother: which city for a long time was the Metropolitane of that country. If this opinion of <HI>Duglo&s;&s;us</HI> be true, who may iu&s;tly &s;u&s;pect, (alwaies re&s;erued, if there be any cau&s;e of doubt of the truth of the hi&s;tory) that that band of Romanes, lead by &s;ome captaine named <HI>Libo,</HI> to haue come vnto the &s;ea coa&s;t neere <HI>Fri&s;ch-haff,</HI> toward the Ea&s;t, and doth border vpon the Ru&s;sians, driuen hither either by tempe&s;tuous weather to haue landed in this place, or being followed by the conquerours, to haue withdrawen them&s;elues into the&s;e quarters for &s;helter again&s;t the raging tyranny of <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> &s;ouldiers: and &s;o the <HI>Libones, Liuones</HI> or <HI>Liuonians</HI> to haue receiued their name and appellation from the &s;ame <HI>Libo:</HI> La&s;tly entending their bounds further and &s;preading them&s;elues euery way, &s;ome to haue been named <HI>Lithuanians,</HI> by a name deriued from the &s;ame, but much altered and corrupt, and others to haue retained &s;till the ancient appellation of the <HI>Pru&s;&s;i.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding al&s;o a great part of <HI>Pomerland,</HI> and <HI>Culmi&s;chland,</HI> and the skirts of <HI>Michelaw,</HI> after that they came to be &s;ubiect to the &s;ame iuri&s;diction with <HI>Spru&s;e,</HI> and were vnder the command of the Knights of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;&s;e, (Teutones Crucigeri)</HI> began to be called by one name, <HI>Spru&s;e:</HI> yet indeed, that is properlie and truly called <HI>Spru&s;e,</HI> which is comprehended between the riuers <HI>Wei&s;&s;el, (Vi&s;tulo) Dribentz, O&s;&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Nemen,</HI> and the bay <HI>Fri&s;ch-haff,</HI> (which we &s;poke of before) and from <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;ouia</HI> is diuided by thicke woods full of Meeres and Bogges. Thus farre out of <HI>Cromer.</HI> I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e al&s;o to &s;et down heere the ancient diui&s;ion of this country of <HI>Spru&s;e</HI> into particular &s;hires, as <HI>Ca&s;per Henne|berger</HI> hath written, who&s;e words are the&s;e.</P>
<P>VIDIVVTO, or, as he is called of &s;ome, VIDINITVS, king of <HI>Boru&s;&s;ia,</HI> in the yeare of Chri&s;t 573. when he was 116. yeares old, be|fore he together with his brother BRVTENOCRIBE, did ca&s;t him&s;elfe, for a &s;acrifice to his Gods, into the fire, thus diuided his po&s;&s;e&s;si|ons vnto his &s;onnes. Hee had, as they report 12. &s;onnes. The I. was LITPHO, or as others call him LITALAN, to whom he gaue <HI>Lituania the Lower,</HI> &amp; made him king &amp; &s;oueraigne of the re&s;t, but he, for the murder of CRIBE, a Bi&s;hop of theirs &s;o called, was reiected of his brethren. Among&s;t the other eleuen he diuided the country of <HI>Spru&s;e.</HI> Of the&s;e the fir&s;t called ZAMO, obtained that tract, which of him to this day is named <HI>Zambia, (Samland)</HI> hauing vpon the We&s;t &amp; North the &s;alt &s;ea; vpon the Ea&s;t the lake <HI>Curi&s;ch-haff, (Curonen&s;is lacus)</HI> and the riuer <HI>Deme:</HI> vpon the South the riuer <HI>Pregel:</HI> it is a receiued opinion among&s;t them that he dwelt in the mount GALTAGARE. II. SVDO, got for his portion that part of the country where now are <HI>Oletzo, Stradaun, Lick.</HI> part of the precincts or liberties of <HI>Iohani&s;burg, Letzen, Angerburg</HI> and <HI>In&s;terburg:</HI> and hath vpon the Ea&s;t, <HI>Lituania:</HI> on the South, <HI>Ma&s;ouia</HI> and <HI>Galindia:</HI> on the North-We&s;t, <HI>Barthonia, (Barthenerland)</HI> on the North, <HI>Schalauonia.</HI> This country they called, after his name, <HI>Sudauia.</HI> Which name afterward, when this whole tract was &s;poiled and laid wa&s;t by the <HI>Crucigeri</HI> (the knights of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;&s;e,</HI>) it vtterly lo&s;t: and therefore whether this country was called <HI>Sudauia,</HI> or not, the latter writers are wholly ignorant, and they do thinke it to haue beene in <HI>Sambia,</HI> where now is the canton called <HI>Der Sudawi&s;che winkel oder der Bru&s;ter ort,</HI> but they are deceiued: For for their treachery they were of the <HI>Crucigeri</HI> tran&s;lated thither. III. NADROO, was &s;eated between <HI>Sambia, Scalauonia,</HI> and <HI>Barthonia,</HI> where there are many riuers, forre&s;ts, and va&s;t wilderne&s;&s;es, and is called <HI>Nadraw,</HI> (NADRAVIA.) In this prouince are <HI>Tapiaw, Taplaucken, Salaw, Georgenburg &amp;c.</HI> &s;trong and defen&s;ible ca&s;tels. IIII. SCALAVONI, had tho&s;e places giuen him which are on either &s;ide of the riuer <HI>Memel,</HI> (the old writers called it <HI>Cronon</HI>) and therefore his portion was na|med, <HI>Scalauonia,</HI> after his own name. V. NATANGO, got that part which of him was called <HI>Natangen,</HI> and hath vpon his North &s;ide the riuer <HI>Pregel,</HI> vpon the Ea&s;t, <HI>Alla.</HI> VI. BARTHO, enioyed <HI>Barthonia, <HI>Barthenerland.</HI></HI> It was diuided into the Greater, the Le&s;&s;er, and <HI>Plick Barthen;</HI> but now tho&s;e diui&s;ions are forgotten and out of v&s;e. VII. GALINDO, that tract from <HI>Ma&s;ouia,</HI> vnto the riuer <HI>Alla,</HI> and the lake <HI>Spirding,</HI> of him was named <HI>Galindia,</HI> and conteineth many huge de&s;erts: a great part of it doth belong to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Var|mia,</HI> and is now accounted as part of <HI>Ermeland.</HI> VIII. VARMONI, for his portion was a&s;signed VARMIA, lying between the countries <HI>Galindia, Natangia,</HI> and <HI>Poge&s;amia.</HI> But he not liuing long after his father, this prouince &s;oone againe lo&s;t that name, and of his mother was named by a Germane name <HI>Ermeland.</HI> IX. HOGGO, his Lord&s;hip was &s;euered from <HI>Ermeland,</HI> by the riuer <HI>Pa&s;&s;erg:</HI> from <HI>Pome&s;a|mia,</HI> by the riuer <HI>We&s;eck</HI> and the lake <HI>Drau&s;en:</HI> but now of the Germanes it is called <HI>Hockerland,</HI> but by the Latines, of POGIA, his daugh|ter, it is named <HI>Poge&s;ania.</HI> X. POMESO, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Pome&s;ania,</HI> (denominated of him) bounded by the riuers <HI>Wei&s;&s;el, Wee&s;eck, O&s;&s;a</HI> or <HI>Moc|kra.</HI> XI. CHELMO, obtained for his portion <HI>Culmigeria,</HI> or <HI>Hulmigeria</HI> (they call it <HI>Colmi&s;hland:</HI>) a prouince lying between the riuers <HI>Wei&s;&s;el, Mockra,</HI> or <HI>O&s;&s;o</HI> and <HI>Dreuentza,</HI> well repleni&s;hed with ca&s;tels and cities. Heere is another &s;hire worth the remembrance which they call <HI>So&s;&s;aw: Item</HI> another called LOBOVIA, <HI>(Lobaw)</HI> belonging to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Culm.</HI> HVNTAVV, al&s;o a very little prouince, but well inhabited. There is al&s;o an iland about <HI>Margeburg</HI> (or <HI>Marienburg</HI>) enclo&s;ed round with a bancke or wall by the <HI>Crucigeri,</HI> the knight of the <HI>Holy Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> again&s;t the inundations and breaking-in of the riuers <HI>Wei&s;&s;el</HI> and <HI>Nogot,</HI> and it is called <HI>The Greater ile, <HI>Gros Werder.</HI> The Le&s;&s;er ile, <HI>Das klein Werder,</HI></HI> is in <HI>Pomerell,</HI> about <HI>Dantzk.</HI> La&s;tly, MARIANA by <HI>Marienwerder,</HI> an Iland &s;o called, which is not in|habited, but re&s;erued for pa&s;ture and meddow yeelding yearely great profit.</P>
<P>This authour promi&s;eth a peculiar Treati&s;e of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> with a further di&s;cour&s;e of this his mappe.

<P><HI>_LIuonia,</HI> (as <HI>Lewenclay</HI> writeth) extendeth it &s;elfe along the &s;ea coa&s;t aboue 4000. furlongs, and where it is nar|rowe&s;t it is 1300. furlongs broad. The Pru&s;sians, Lithuanians, and Ru&s;sians dwell round about it, the re&s;t the Liuonian Gulfe doth bound. <HI>Liuonia</HI> conteineth the CVRONES, ESTHENI, and LETTI, nations different both in maners and language. In the cities and townes they v&s;e the Saxon or German tongue. The country is full of wood, plaine and champion without hils or mountaines, for the mo&s;t part lying lay and vnhusbanded, notwith&s;tanding that the &s;oile is good and fertile. For if you &s;hall except wine and oile, and &s;ome few other &s;uch things which nature yeeldeth to &s;ome countries that are &s;ituate in a more temperate cli|mate, (for the&s;e only are brought in hither vnto them) other things more nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of mans life, are heere found in &s;uch great plenty, that they do liberally communicate them to &s;trangers and for|reiners. They haue great plenty of Fi&s;h and Deere. <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> affirmeth, that the Hares in this country do in euery &s;ea&s;on of the yeare change their colour: for in the winter they are white, and in the &s;ummer they are gray. From hence, wax, hony, a&s;hes, &s;tone-pitch, <HI>(pix arida)</HI> liquid pitch, (the Dutch call it <HI>Ther,</HI> we, <HI>Tarre</HI>) and that kind of corne which the Latines call <HI>Secale,</HI> the Germanes <HI>Rogghe,</HI> and we <HI>Rie,</HI> is yearely brought vnto vs in great abundance.</P>
<P>It hath certaine cities very large and finely built; of them the chiefe&s;t is RIGA, a colonie of the Germanes of the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Breme,</HI> commodiou&s;ly &s;eated vpon the riuer <HI>Duin.</HI> It is a goodly Mart towne, and the Metropolitane of the whole prouince. RIVALIA, (they vulgarly call it <HI>Reuel,</HI> the Ru&s;sians <HI>Roliua,</HI>) built by <HI>Waldemare</HI> king of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> famous for his goodly hauen vpon a bay of the Balticke or Ea&s;t-&s;ea. This for traffique is not le&s;&s;e frequented or populous then <HI>Riga.</HI> DORPATVM, <HI>(Derpt)</HI> neere neighbour to the Ru&s;sians, which call it <HI>Iuriongorod.</HI> The riuer <HI>Becke</HI> runneth by the walles of this city, very commodious for traffique with the Ru&s;sians. This riuer is caried in one channell into the &s;ea, which running violently with a great fall from &s;teep rocks, worketh the &s;ame effect to the people neere adioining, as <HI>Lewenclay</HI> &s;aith, that the cataracts or fals of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> did to the Aegyptians, which in continuance of time by little and little grow to be deaffi&s;h and thicke of hearing. Be&s;ides the&s;e cities there are certaine le&s;&s;er townes, fortified with goodly &s;trong ca&s;tles; VENDA, <HI>Wenden,</HI> the more honourable for that heere the Grand-captaine or Ma&s;ter of the order, keepeth his court. It is &s;ituate in the midde&s;t of the country: Then VELINVM, <HI>Welum, Parnaw,</HI> vpon the &s;ea, <HI>Wolmer, Ve&s;eburgum,</HI> (I thinke they call it <HI>Y&s;eborg) Witte&s;tein, Narua,</HI> and others. <HI>Willichius</HI> and <HI>Cureus</HI> do thinke that the <HI>Efflui</HI> and <HI>Limouij</HI> did &s;ometime dwell in the&s;e quarters.

Before Chri&s;tianity was entertained here, they &s;pake the Wandall language, and followed their fa&s;hions and maner of life, vntill &s;uch time as they were &s;ub|dued vnder the command of the Roman Emperours, for then together with Religion they began to v&s;e the Saxon tongue, which to this day they retaine. Thus farre <HI>Artopoeus. Pomerye,</HI> in the Wandalian language, which is the &s;ame with the Slauonian tongue, &s;ignifieth no|thing els, as <HI>Herber&s;tein</HI> affirmeth, but neere the &s;ea or a marine coa&s;t. The banke or &s;ea-wall of this country is &s;o &s;trongly fortified by na|ture with &s;uch a &s;trong rampart, that heere is no feare of the &s;ea breaking in to ouerflow them. The more famous cities vpon this coa&s;t, be|&s;ides, &s;ome other &s;ituate further within the land, are, <HI>Stetin, Newgard, Stargard, &amp;c.</HI> STETIN &s;ometime was but a &s;mall village inhabited by a few poore fi&s;hermen, but after that Chri&s;tianity was planted heere about, <HI>Wineta</HI> vtterly de&s;troied, and the mart was remoued hither, it begun pre&s;ently &s;o to flouri&s;h, that now it is become the Metropolitan of the whole country. It is mo&s;t plea&s;antly &s;eated vpon the banke of the riuer <HI>Oder,</HI> from the which it ari&s;eth by little and little higher vpon the &s;ide of an hill. It is enclo&s;ed with a &s;trong wall and deep trench. GRYPSVVALD, is a towne in the Dukedome of <HI>Wolga&s;t,</HI> which others do call the Dukedome of <HI>Barth:</HI> this towne being long together much afflicted with ciuill warres, was much hindered and impaired: but in the yeare 1456. by erecting and placing of an Vniuer&s;ity there, it began againe by little and little to lift vp the head. IVLINVM, a towne &s;ometime not inferiour vnto the goodly cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> whether you re&s;pect the wealth of the citizens or &s;tately buildings of the &s;ame. This was &s;ometime a famous mart towne of the Wandalls. Such a multitude of merchants did flocke hither, from <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia, Saxony, Lau&s;&s;nitz, Mei&s;en,</HI> and all parts of <HI>Wandal-land,</HI> in &s;uch troopes, that in all <HI>Europe,</HI> except <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> there was &s;carce &s;uch a mart to be found: but it was &s;o &s;haken by the violent warres of the Danes, that at la&s;t it was almo&s;t wholly brought to nothing; &s;uch is the mutability of vncon&s;tant fortune alwaies delighted in change. Now they call it <HI>Wollin.</HI> STRALSVND, vpon the &s;ea &s;hore. It hath had &s;ometime his proper prince, viz. the Duke of <HI>Barth.</HI> It is a city very populous and greatly frequented by Merchants. WINETA, this &s;ometime was al&s;o a city of good reckoning, peraduenture it is now called <HI>Archon</HI> or <HI>Iulinum, (Wollin.)</HI> For the cities of <HI>Wandal-land,</HI> according to the diuer&s;ity of languages of &s;undry nations, had their diuers names. That which the Wandalls called <HI>Stargard,</HI> the Saxons named <HI>Aldenburg,</HI> and the Danes <HI>Banne&s;ia</HI> as <HI>Crantzius</HI> affirmeth. But I thinke it good to &s;et down the de&s;cription of this country, which the &s;ingular learned man, M. <HI>Peter Edling</HI> &s;ent me from <HI>Colberg,</HI> in this maner: <HI>Pomerland</HI> at this day hath forty cities, enclo&s;ed with walls and ditches; be&s;ides certaine goodly ca&s;tles and mona&s;teries. Among&s;t the which the&s;e are the chiefe: <HI>Stral&s;und, Stettin, Gryp&s;wald, Stargard, Colberg</HI> and <HI>Anglame.</HI> Fiue hundred yeares &s;ince, before the enterteinment of Chri&s;tian religion, which was in the yeare 1124. and when they left the Slauonian tongue, <HI>Pomerland</HI> was greater, and not much inferiour to a kingdome.

<HEAD>SCANDIA, OR THE NORTHREN <HI>Kingdomes.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THis Mappe conteineth almo&s;t all the Northen tract of the knowen world: but e&s;pecially the Neck-land or <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> knowen vnto the old writers by the&s;e names, <HI>Scandia, Scandinauia, Bal|tia</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ilia,</HI> but to them neuer throughly di&s;cried: which in regard of his greatne&s;&s;e they haue called <HI>Another World,</HI> and the Shoppe of men, and as it were the &s;cabberd from whence &s;o ma|ny Nations haue been drawen. But of the diuers names of this country, read that which we haue written at the mappe of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> as al&s;o in our Trea&s;ury of Geography, in the word BASILIA. This Neckeland in this our age conteineth three kingdomes, <HI>Norwey, Swedland</HI> and <HI>Gotland;</HI> with a part of the kingdome of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and many other prouinces, as <HI>Bothny, Finmarke, Finland Lappland, &amp;c.</HI> who&s;e &s;euerall de&s;criptions we will heere &s;et downe out of <HI>Iames Ziegler.</HI></P>
<P>NORVEGIA, <HI>Norway,</HI> if you would interpret it, is as much to &s;ay, as the Northren tract, or Northren way. This was &s;ometime a mo&s;t flouri&s;hing kingdome, and comprehended <HI>Denmarke,</HI> and <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> with the circumiacent Ilands, vntill &s;uch time as the kingdome was gouerned by an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of kings. Afterward the line failing, in the time of vacancie, by the con&s;ent of the Nobility it was decreed, that the kings &s;hould be cho&s;en by electi|on. At this day it is vnder the iuri&s;diction of the kings of <HI>Denmarke,</HI> who do not only take the lawfull reuenews iu&s;tly due to the crowne, but impo&s;ing intolerable exactions, and by &s;craping and raking all commodities into their hands, they con|uey all the wealth of this country into <HI>Denmarke.</HI> Neither is this aggreeuance alone, but with all the di&s;aduantage and con|dition of the place doth much hurt the &s;ubiects: for all the hauens, roads, &amp; &s;hipping are at the command of the king of <HI>Den|marke:</HI> &s;o that neither they may without his leaue v&s;e the &s;ea or tran&s;port their merchandi&s;e into forren countries. This kingdome either for the temperature of the aire, goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, or benefit of the &s;ea is not of meane e&s;timation and account. This doth tran&s;port into other parts of <HI>Europe</HI> a fi&s;h which is a kind of codde, &s;litte and &s;pread vpon a po&s;t and &s;o dried and hardened with the fro&s;t and cold: and thereupon the Germanes call it <HI>Stockfi&s;h.</HI> The be&s;t time of the yeare to catch them is in <HI>Ianuary,</HI> when as the weather is colde&s;t to drie them: tho&s;e which are taken when the weather is more mild, they &s;hrinke or rotte away, and are not fit to be tran&s;ported any whither. All the &s;ea coa&s;t of <HI>Norway</HI> is very calme and temperate: the &s;ea free&s;eth not: the &s;now continueth not long.</P>
<P>SVECIA, <HI>Sweden</HI> or <HI>Swedland,</HI> is a kingdome rich of &s;iluer, copper, lead, iron, corne and cattell. Wonderfull plenty of fi&s;h is heere taken both in riuers, lakes, and creekes, a&s;well as in the maine ocean. Heere are many Deere and wild bea&s;ts. <HI>Stockholme</HI> is the kings &s;eat and chiefe mart towne, a city fortified both by nature, by art, and indu&s;trie of the ingenious Ar|chitect. It &s;tandeth in a fenne, like <HI>Venice:</HI> and thereof it took the name, for that being &s;ituate in the waters it is built vpon piles, which they call <HI>Stockes.</HI></P>
<P>GOTHIA, <HI>(Gotland)</HI> that is, the Good land, is &s;ubiect to the king of <HI>Sweden.</HI> In it is the port and mart towne <HI>Calmar,</HI> a great city. Heere is a goodly Ca&s;tle which for ingenious Architecture or Fortification, as al&s;o for large compa&s;&s;e and con|tent is not much inferiour to that of <HI>Millane</HI> in <HI>Italie.</HI> Neere <HI>Tinguallen</HI> are mines of excellent iron. Thus farre <HI>Ziegler.</HI></P>
<P>Of DENMARKE and the BRITISH ILES we will &s;peake nothing in this place, &s;eeing that we entreated of them at their proper and &s;euerall mappes. In this chart there is de&s;cribed al&s;o ISLAND, an Iland as famous as any other for &s;trange mira|cles and &s;ecret works of nature. <HI>Item</HI> GROENLAND, another Iland knowen to very few. Heere al&s;o is FRIESLAND, a third iland altogether vnknowen to ancient writers; neither is it once named of the latter Geographers or Hydrographers; only <HI>Nicolao Zeno,</HI> a Venetian, who, in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1380. to&s;&s;ed with many continuall bitter &s;tormes in this &s;ea, at la&s;t rent and weather-beaten, arriued in this Ile. This authour affirmeth that this iland is &s;ubiect to the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> and to be greater then <HI>Ireland,</HI> and that the chiefe towne is of the &s;ame name with the Ile it &s;elfe; la&s;tly, that the country people do for the mo&s;t part liue by fi&s;hing. For in the hauen of this towne they catch &s;uch abundance of all &s;orts of fi&s;h, that from thence they lade whole &s;hippes, and tran&s;port them into other ilands neere adioining. The &s;ea next to this iland vpon the We&s;t, full of &s;helues and rocks, as he writeth, is of the inhabitants called <HI>Mare Icarium, Icarus</HI> &s;ea: and an iland in it, he &s;aith is named ICARIA. Of GROENLAND he writeth, that the winter heere is 9. moneths long, and all that time it neuer rain|eth, nor the &s;now which falleth in the beginning of winter euer di&s;&s;olueth vntill the latter end of the &s;ame. But that is mo&s;t wonderfull which he telleth of the Mona&s;tery of the order of Frier Predicants, dedicated to the honour of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> in this Iland: namely, that there is not farre from it a mountaine, which like vnto <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> doth at certaine &s;ea&s;ons burne and ca&s;t out huge flakes of fire, and that there is in the &s;ame place a fountaine of hot or skalding waters, wherewith not only all the chambers of this mona&s;tery are warmed in the maner of Stones, and hot-hou&s;es, but al&s;o all kind of meat and bread is &s;odden and dre&s;&s;ed, and with no other fire. All the mona&s;tery is built of a kind of hollow light &s;tone, which the flames of that burning mountaine do ca&s;t forth. For the&s;e burning &s;tones, being by nature &s;omewhat fat and oily, are &s;olid and firme, but being quenched with this water, they become drie, full of holes and light; and the water wherewith they were quen|ched is turned into a clammy kind of &s;tuffe like <HI>bitumen,</HI> wherewith the&s;e &s;tones are laied, in &s;teed of mortar, when they are to v&s;e them in building: and thus they make a &s;ure worke again&s;t the iniury of all weathers, Their orchyeards al&s;o and gar|dens watered with this water are alwaies green and do flouri&s;h almo&s;t all the yeare long, with all maner of flowres, kinds of corne and fruits. This Priory &s;tandeth vpon the &s;ea &s;hore, and hath a rea&s;onable capacious and large hauen; into which the forenamed fountaine emptying his waters, doth make it &s;o warme that it neuer free&s;eth, in the harde&s;t and egere&s;t froa&s;t that euer was knowen. Whereupon heere is &s;uch abundance of fi&s;h, which do flocke hither from more colde places, that not only the&s;e Monkes, but al&s;o the neighbours round about are furni&s;hed from hence with proui&s;ion of victuall. The&s;e thinges among&s;t many others <HI>Zenus</HI> hath written of the&s;e Ilands, who, being made by <HI>Zichimnus,</HI> king of certaine Ilands heere about, high Admirall of his nauy, di&s;couered all the&s;e Northren coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>The ile FRIESLAND, now againe in the&s;e our daies was de&s;cried by the Engli&s;hmen, and was by them called by a new name WEST ENGLAND. In old writers there are but few records left of the&s;e Ilands. Among&s;t the new writers <HI>Olaus Magnus Gothus, Epi&s;copus Vp&s;alien&s;is, Albertus Crantzius, Saxo Grammaticus, Iacobus Zieglerus, Sigi&s;mundus ab Herber&s;tein</HI> in his commentaries of <HI>Mo&s;couia,</HI> haue de&s;cribed the&s;e countries: And <HI>Nicolas Wimman</HI> hath &s;et forth the nauigation of the Northren &s;ea. See al&s;o a little di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Antony</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Zenis,</HI> two brethren, of the ilands &s;ituate vnder the North pole, together with the &s;hipwracke of <HI>Peter Quirinus,</HI> written by him&s;elfe and <HI>Chri&s;tophero Fiorauante,</HI> as al&s;o by <HI>Nicholas Mighel,</HI> in the Italian tongue. There is al&s;o a di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e Northren parts written by <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabato,</HI> who in the yeare 1557. fir&s;t &s;ailed into the&s;e quarters. But aboue all the hi&s;tory of <HI>Saxony</HI> lately written and &s;et out by <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> is not to be forgotten.</P>

<P>_I Do find in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall hi&s;tory lately &s;et forth and imprinted vnder the name of M. <HI>Adams:</HI> That the people of this Iland came vnto <HI>Adelbert</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Breme,</HI> earne&s;tly entreating him to appoint them &s;ome learned diuines that might be able to preach the Go&s;pell and plant Chri&s;tianity among&s;t them. Neither do I thinke that there is a|ny mention of this Nation in any other more ancient writer than he. Although I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, that <HI>Sigebertus Gemblacen&s;is</HI> hath left record, that Great King <HI>Arthur,</HI> about the yeare of Chri&s;t 470. &s;ubdued this iland and redu|ced the people to his obedience. This I take as a fable, not for any true hi&s;tory. For I do certainly know that this was neuer written by <HI>Sigebert,</HI> but &s;huffled in, as many things els, by &s;ome other. For a very faire Manu&s;cript copy of mine owne, as al&s;o another in parchment of my friend, haue it not.) Now this <HI>Adelbert</HI> died about the yeare af|ter Chri&s;ts incarnation 1070. And that the name <HI>Thule,</HI> oft &s;poken of almo&s;t by all old writers a&s;well Poets and Hi&s;torians as Geographers, doth not pertaine to this Iland (again&s;t the opinion well neere of all the learned men of our time) but rather to <HI>Scone (Scandia Penin&s;ula)</HI> a neck-land of <HI>Norway,</HI> not only the authority of <HI>Procopius;</HI> a graue di&s;creet writer; but al&s;o for that a note and remnant of that name yet remaineth to this day in <HI>Scone,</HI> in that part which is oppo&s;ite to the Or|keney iles; namely in a place of <HI>Norway</HI> where the famous Mart of the <HI>Belgae</HI> is &s;eated. For among&s;t other &s;hires of <HI>Norway</HI> there is one in this place which they call <HI>Tilemercke,</HI> that is, the March or &s;hire of <HI>Tule.</HI> The ilands al&s;o ouer again&s;t this &s;hore which vulgarly are called <HI>Hetland</HI> and <HI>Shetland,</HI> the &s;eamen, as I vnder&s;tand out of <HI>England</HI> by the relation of my good friend M. W. <HI>Camden,</HI> are commonly called <HI>Thylin&s;el,</HI> where|by I conceiue that this Iland tooke the name from the next maine land oppo&s;ite vnto it. For what els is <HI>Thilen&s;el,</HI> but the iland of <HI>Thile?</HI> This opinion of mine not only <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> doth confirme, who writeth that <HI>Thule</HI> was oppo&s;ite to the &s;ea coa&s;t of the <HI>Belgae;</HI> (he directly &s;aith, I &s;ay <HI>Belgarum,</HI> not <HI>Britannorum littori,</HI> the &s;ea coa&s;t of <HI>Britaine</HI> where indeed <HI>I&s;land</HI> is &s;ituate, not <HI>Thule:</HI>) but al&s;o <HI>Ptolemey</HI> the prince of all Geo|graphers and writers in that argument, who placeth <HI>Thule</HI> vnder the 29. degree of Longitude, and 63. of Latitude. Which po&s;ition and calcula|tion of degrees doth exactly and preci&s;ely fall vpon <HI>Tilemarke.</HI> And as for <HI>I&s;land</HI> there is no man that hath looked with halfe an eie into Geogra|phicall Mappes and Charts, but doth know it to lie vnder the fir&s;t degree of Longitude, and the &s;ixtieth degree of Latitude. And I per&s;wade my &s;elfe euen <HI>Arngrimus Ionas</HI> him&s;elfe, an I&s;lander borne, in that his Treati&s;e of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> where he &s;aith that the latitude of this Iland is about 44. de|grees and 45. minutes was much deceiued. It is therefore as cleare as the noone day, as he &s;aith, that <HI>I&s;land</HI> is not the &s;ame that <HI>Thule</HI> was: and the &s;ame <HI>Procopius</HI> &s;aith, that it is inhabited by thirteen Nations, and gouerned by &s;o many Kings, and to be tenne times as great as <HI>Brittaine:</HI> &s;o that not without good cau&s;e <HI>Stephanus</HI> giueth it the title of Great; when as it is certaine that <HI>I&s;land</HI> is much le&s;&s;e than <HI>Brittaine.</HI> The &s;ame <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmeth that the <HI>Scritifinni,</HI> a kind of people &s;o called, did inhabite <HI>Thule;</HI> the&s;e <HI>Diaconus</HI> nameth <HI>Strictofinni:</HI> and &s;peaketh of them in <HI>Scandia;</HI> as doth al&s;o <HI>Iornandes</HI> in his hi&s;tory; notwith&s;tanding he corruptly calleth them (that I may note this by the way) <HI>Crefennae.</HI> Thus, gentle Reader, thou &s;ee&s;t that which they name <HI>Scandia</HI> or <HI>Scone,</HI> he calleth <HI>Thule:</HI> and the &s;ame nation to this day dwelleth in the &s;ame <HI>Scandia,</HI> called by the &s;ame name no whit corrupted. For they are called vulgarly <HI>Scrickefinner,</HI> and do dwell in <HI>Scandia,</HI> and not in <HI>I&s;land.</HI> In <HI>Thule Procopius</HI> writeth, that there be huge great woods: in <HI>I&s;land</HI> all the world knoweth there are none at all. And &s;o <HI>I&s;acius</HI> vpon <HI>Lycophron</HI> &s;aith truly, when he affirmeth that <HI>Thule,</HI> is vpon the Ea&s;t of <HI>Brittaine,</HI> not vpon the North, as is <HI>I&s;land.</HI> Contrary to that which <HI>Strabo</HI> (a mo&s;t worthy and diligent Geographer, by the &s;ound iudgement of all the learned) &s;aith of it, but from the relation, as there he addeth of <HI>Pytheas,</HI> a &s;hamefull lying hi&s;toriographer, who&s;e cu&s;tome was, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in his &s;econd booke writeth, to counterfait and coine fables &s;o cunningly that ordinarily they pa&s;&s;ed for true &s;tories. This is that <HI>Thule,</HI> which <HI>Tacitus</HI> reporteth, when the Romane nauy &s;ailed round about <HI>Brittaine</HI> was &s;een and viewed by them, but not regarded, and therefore not entered as is probable. This could not be <HI>I&s;land,</HI> which is much farther off, and out of kenning. But this is enough in this place of <HI>Thule</HI> or <HI>Scandia.</HI> We will addre&s;&s;e our &s;elues to &s;peake of <HI>I&s;land,</HI> an iland altogether vnknowen, and not once named in any ancient writer.</P>
<P>ISLAND, or, the <HI>Fro&s;en</HI> or <HI>Icie land,</HI> which is all one, was &s;o named of the ice which lieth continually vpon his North &s;ide: for there now be|ginneth the Fro&s;en-&s;ea, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> writeth. It was called SNELAND, of the Snow which all the yeare long doth heere in &s;ome places continue: <HI>Item</HI> GARDARSHOLM, that is, <HI>Garders ile,</HI> &s;o called, as <HI>Arngrimus</HI> him&s;elfe being an I&s;lander borne writeth, of one <HI>Gardar</HI> a man &s;o named who fir&s;t found it or inhabited the &s;ame. This iland is an hundred Germane miles in length, as commonly mo&s;t writers do hold; but the fore&s;aid <HI>Arn|grimus Ionas</HI> &s;aith it is 144. miles long. For the mo&s;t part it is not inhabited, but is wa&s;t and mountainous, e&s;pecially toward the North part: by rea&s;on of the bitter bla&s;ts of the South winds, which will not &s;uffer, as <HI>Olaus</HI> teacheth, &s;o much as any low &s;hrubbe or bu&s;h once to put forth his head. It is &s;ubiect to the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> and &s;o hath continued euer &s;ince the yeare of Chri&s;t 1260. at what time fir&s;t, the &s;ame <HI>Arngrime</HI> affir|meth, they did their homage to that Crowne. Whereupon the king of <HI>Denmarke</HI> euery yeare &s;endeth thither a Lieutenant, by whom they are now gouerned, as in times pa&s;t they were by certaine Bi&s;hops of their owne; by whom they were, as we &s;aid before, conuerted vnto Chri&s;tianity, in the time of <HI>Adelbert</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Breme.</HI> In the raigne of <HI>Harald</HI> with the faire lockes, (<HI>Pulchricomus, Harfagro</HI> they vulgarly called him as <HI>Ionas</HI> writeth) who was the fir&s;t Monarch of <HI>Norway,</HI> it was fir&s;t begun to be inhabited, as &s;ome would faine per&s;wade: namely, when he had ouercome the pety kings and had bani&s;hed them out of <HI>Norway,</HI> they being driuen to &s;eeke their dwelling in &s;ome other place, they for&s;ooke their owne natiue country, &s;hipped them&s;elues together with their wiues, children, and whole families, landed at the length in this iland, and heere &s;eated them&s;elues. This &s;eemeth to me to haue happened about the yeare of Chri&s;ts incarnation 1000. but the forenamed authour <HI>Arngrimus Ionas</HI> &s;aith that it was in the yeare 874. who al&s;o there &s;etteth downe a Catalogue and names of all their Bi&s;hops. The fir&s;t Bi&s;hop, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> writeth, was <HI>I&s;leff.</HI> That it was &s;ubiect to the command of the &s;ame Norweies about 200. yeares, I find in the abridgement of <HI>Zenies</HI> Eclogs, where I find that <HI>Zichmi</HI> king of <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> attempted warre again&s;t this iland, but in vaine, and was repelled by a garri&s;on of &s;ouldiers placed there by the king of <HI>Norway,</HI> to defend the &s;ame from the a&s;&s;ault of enemies. It is diuided into foure parts or prouinces according to the foure quarters of the World: namely, into <HI>We&s;tfiordung, Au&s;tlendingafiordung, Nordlingafiordung</HI> and <HI>Sundlendingafiordung,</HI> as to &s;ay as the We&s;t quarter, Ea&s;t quarter, North quarter and South quarter. It hath but two Bi&s;hops &s;eas, <HI>Schalholdt,</HI> and <HI>Hola;</HI> with certaine &s;choles adioined vnto them. In the dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Hola</HI> are the Mona&s;teries <HI>Pingora, Reme&s;ted, Modur,</HI> and <HI>Munketuere.</HI> In the dioce&s;&s;e of <HI>Schalholdt</HI> are <HI>Videy, Pyrnebar, Kirkebar</HI> and <HI>Skirda.</HI> Yet by the letters of <HI>Velleius,</HI> the authour of this chart, which he wrote vnto me, I do vnder&s;tand that there are heere nine mona&s;teries: and be&s;ides them 329. churches. They haue no coine of their owne, nor cities: for the mountaines are to them in &s;teed of cities, and fountaines for plea&s;ure and delights, as <HI>Crantzius</HI> te&s;tifieth, who affirmeth that for the mo&s;t part they dwell in caues, making their lodgings and roomes by cut|ting and digging them out in the &s;ides of hilles. The which al&s;o <HI>Olaus</HI> doth te&s;tifie, e&s;pecially in the winter time. They build their hou&s;es of fi&s;h bones, for want of wood. Contrariwi&s;e <HI>Ionas</HI> he &s;aith, that heere are many churches and hou&s;es built rea&s;onably faire and &s;umptuou&s;ly of wood, &s;tone and turffe. Wares they exchange with Merchants for other wares. Forrein dainties and plea&s;ures they are not acquainted withall. They &s;peake the Cimbrian language, or the ancient Germane tongue, into which we &s;aw this other day the holy Scriptures tran&s;lated, and imprinted at <HI>Hola</HI> (a place in the North part of this iland) in a mo&s;t goodly and faire letter, in the yeare of our Lord 1584. I &s;ay, in the old Germane tongue: for I do ob&s;erue it to be the &s;ame with that, in which a little booke that is imprinted vnder the name of <HI>Otfrides Gospels,</HI> is written in. <HI>Ionas</HI> him&s;elfe confe&s;&s;eth that they haue no maner of cattell be&s;ide Hor&s;es, and Kine. <HI>Velleius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth that they haue no trees but Berch and Iuniper. The &s;oile is fatte for pa&s;torage and the gra&s;&s;e &s;o ranke, that all men that haue written of this iland do iontly and with one con&s;ent affirme, that except they do &s;ometime fetch their cattell from the pa&s;ture and moderate their feeding, they wil be in danger of being &s;topped vp with their owne fatte. Yet all in vaine oft times, as the &s;ame <HI>Arngrime</HI> affirmeth. The &s;oile is not good for corne or for eareable ground, and &s;o it beareth not any ma|ner of graine, therefore for the mo&s;t part they liue altogether on fi&s;h. Which al&s;o being dried and beaten, and as it were ground to meale they make into loaues and cakes, and do v&s;e it at their tables in &s;tead of bread. Their drinke in former time was faire water, but now of corne, brought vnto them from forren places, they haue learned to brew a kind of beere: &s;o that after they began to trade with &s;trangers re&s;orting to them, they began al&s;o to loue better liquours and haue left their drinking of water. For as <HI>Georgius Bruno</HI> maketh me beleeue, the Lubekers, Hamburgers and Bremers do yearely re&s;ort to this iland, which thither do cary Meale, Bread, Beere, Wine, Aqua vitae, cour&s;e Engli&s;h clothes and other &s;uch of low prices, both Wollen and Linnen, Iron, Steele, Tinne, Copper, Siluer, Mony both Siluer and Gold, Kniues, Shoes, Coifes and Ker|cheifes for women, and Wood whereof they build their hou&s;es and make their boats. For the&s;e they exchange the <HI>I&s;land</HI> cloth, (they commonly call it <HI>Watman</HI>) huge lumps of Brim&s;tone, and great &s;tore of dried fi&s;h, <HI>Stockefi&s;h</HI> we call it. All this out of the We&s;t and South parts of the &s;ame. Out of the Ea&s;t and North part of the iland, where there is great plenty of gra&s;&s;e, they tran&s;port into other countries, Mutton and Beefe, butter and

Their oxen and kine are all heere polled and without hornes: their &s;heepe are not &s;o. <HI>Saxo Grammaticus</HI> and <HI>Olaus Magnus</HI> do tell of many wonders and &s;trange works of God in this iland, whereof &s;ome it will not be ami&s;&s;e to receit in this place. But e&s;pecially the mount <HI>Hekla,</HI> which continually burneth like vnto <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicilia,</HI> although alwaies tho&s;e flames do not appeare, but at certaine times, as <HI>Arngrimus Ionas</HI> writeth, and affirmeth to be recorded in their hi&s;tories, as namely in the yeare 1104. 1157. 1222. 1300. 1340. 1362. 1389. and 1558. which was the la&s;t time that the fire brake out of this hill. Of the like nature is another hill, which they call <HI>Hel|ga&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ll,</HI> that is, the Holy mount. Of the which mountaine the forenamed <HI>Bruno,</HI> a laborious &s;tudent, and for that his worthy worke which he hath &s;et out of all the cities of the World, famous and knowen farre and neere all the World ouer, hath written in his priuate letters vnto me, that in the yeare 1580. (<HI>Ionas</HI> &s;aith it fell out in the yeare 1581.) not in <HI>Hecla,</HI> but in another mount, namely, in <HI>Helge&s;el,</HI> fire and &s;tones were ca&s;t out with &s;uch crackes, thundering and hideous noi&s;e, that foure&s;core miles off one would haue thought great ordenance and double canons had been di&s;|charged heere. At this hill there is an huge gulfe, where &s;pirits of men lately departed, do offer them&s;elues &s;o plainely to be &s;eene and di&s;cerned of tho&s;e that &s;ometime knew them in their life time, that they are often taken for liuing men of &s;uch as are not aware that they are dead: neither do they perceiue that they were deceiued, vntill the Gho&s;ts be gone. (<HI>Ionas</HI> accounteth this for a fable.) There are al&s;o certaine &s;pirits or gho&s;ts, which do &s;hew them&s;elues apparantly to be &s;een in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of mortall men, or of &s;uch as came to their end by &s;ome violent mi&s;chance, as <HI>Olaus</HI> reporteth. They call the&s;e <HI>Drols,</HI> as <HI>Rithmayer</HI> te&s;tifieth. (Now <HI>Drol,</HI> is a giant of the mountaines, if we may beleeue <HI>Arngrime Ionas</HI> an Ilander by birth and bringing vp.) Heere is a &s;pring which by rea&s;on of a filthy &s;moaking water which runneth from it, killeth any thing that na|turally the earth bringeth forth: and what&s;oeuer is be&s;mered with this &s;mokie fume, in continuance of time becommeth as hard as a &s;tone, yet &s;till retaining the &s;hape that it had before. There is al&s;o a &s;pring of pe&s;tilent waters, which who&s;oeuer &s;hall ta&s;t or drinke of, will pre&s;ently be as if he had drunke poi&s;on. Heere al&s;o are certaine waters that are in propertie and ta&s;t &s;omewhat like drinke that is made of mault. There are fires heere, that will not burne or con&s;ume flax, yet they will quite drie vp and con&s;ume water. They haue beares, crowes, and white hares. As al&s;o Eagles with white tailes, as our authour <HI>Ionas</HI> the I&s;lander whom we haue often cited, doth witne&s;&s;e. The&s;e <HI>Pliny</HI> (as he there alleageth) calleth <HI>Pygargos,</HI> I thinke we call them <HI>Wringtailes.</HI> But tho&s;e that are de&s;irous to know all the &s;trange wonders of this iland let them read <HI>Albert Crantz, Saxo Grammaticus, Iohannes Magnus,</HI> and <HI>Olaus Magnus,</HI> whom they may beleeue or not beleeue, according as they &s;hall find cau&s;e. To tho&s;e they may adioine that which <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> in his Saxon hi&s;tory hath written of this iland. Except I be deceiued, the fable which <HI>I&s;acius</HI> vpon <HI>Lyco|phron</HI> reciteth, of a certaine iland of <HI>Brittany,</HI> whither he &s;aith the &s;oules of dead men are tran&s;ported, doth perteine to this iland.

<HEAD>A declaration of the Markes and Letters of this Mappe.</HEAD>
<P>A. Is a fi&s;h which they commonly call <HI>Nahual.</HI> If any man eat of this fi&s;h, he dieth pre&s;ently. It hath a tooth in the forepart of his head, &s;tanding out &s;euen cubites. This diuers haue &s;old for the Vnicornes horne. It is thought to be a good antidote and &s;oueraigne medicine again&s;t poi&s;on. This Mon&s;ter is forty elles in length. B. The <HI>Roider,</HI> a fi&s;h of an hundred and thirty elles in length, which hath no teeth. The fle&s;h of it is very good meat, whole&s;ome and tooth&s;ome. The fatte of it is good again&s;t many di&s;ea&s;es. C. The <HI>Burchualur,</HI> hath his head bigger than all the body be&s;ide. It hath many very &s;trong teeth, whereof they make Che&s;men or Tablemen. It is three&s;core cubites long. D. The <HI>Hyena,</HI> the &s;ea hogge, a mon&s;trous kind of fi&s;h, of which thou maie&s;t read in the 21. booke of <HI>Olaus Magnus.</HI> E. <HI>Ziphius,</HI> (it may be he meaneth <HI>Xi|phius,</HI> the &s;word fi&s;h) an horrible &s;ea mon&s;ter, &s;wallowing the blacke &s;eale at one bitte. F. The Engli&s;h whale, thirty elles long: it hath no teeth, but the tongue of it is &s;euen elles in length. G. <HI>Hro&s;hualur,</HI> that is as much to &s;ay as the Sea-hor&s;e, with a mane hanging downe from his necke like an hor&s;e. It often doth the fi&s;hermen great hurt and skare. H. The greate&s;t kind of Whales, which &s;eldome &s;heweth it &s;elfe; it is more like a little iland, than a fi&s;h. It cannot follow or cha&s;e the &s;maller fi&s;hes, by rea&s;on of the huge greatne&s;&s;e and waight of his body, yet he praieth vpon many, which he catcheth by a naturall wile and &s;ubtilty which he v&s;eth for to get his food. I. <HI>Skautuhvalur,</HI> this fi&s;h altogether full of gri&s;tles or bones; is &s;omewhat like a ray or skaite but an infinite deale bigger: when it appeareth, it is like an iland, and with his &s;innes ouerturneth &s;hips and boates. K. <HI>Seenaut,</HI> &s;ea cowes, of colour gray: they &s;ometimes come out of the &s;ea and do feed vpon the land many in a company toge|ther. They haue a little bagge hanging at their no&s;e, by the helpe of which they liue in the water: that being broken, they liue altogether vpon the land, and do accompany them&s;elues with other kine. L. <HI>Steipereidur,</HI> a mo&s;t gentle and tame kind of whale; which for the defence of the fi&s;hermen fighteth again&s;t other Whales. It is forbidden by Proclamation that no man may kill or hurt this &s;ort of Whale. It is in length an hundred cubites at the lea&s;t. M. <HI>Staukul,</HI> the Dutchmen call it <HI>Springual;</HI> he hath beene &s;eene to &s;tand a whole day together vpright vpon his taile. It is &s;o called of leaping or skipping. It is a very dangerous enemy to &s;eamen and fi&s;hers; and greedily &s;eeketh after mans fle&s;h. N. <HI>Ro&s;tunger,</HI> (which al&s;o is otherwi&s;e called a <HI>Ro&s;mar,</HI>) is &s;omewhat like a &s;ea-calfe: it goeth in the bottome of the &s;ea vpon foure feet, but very &s;hort ones. His skinne may &s;carcely be pearced with any weapon. Hee &s;leepeth twelue houres together hanging by his two long teeth vpon &s;ome rocke or cliffe. Ech of his teeth are at the lea&s;t an elle long, but the length of his whole body is foureteen elles long. O. <HI>Sperma ceti,</HI> par|macitty, or a ba&s;e kind of amber, they commonly call it <HI>Hualambur.</HI> P. Blockes and Trunkes of tree by force of winde and violent tempe&s;t blowne vp by the rootes from off the cliffes of <HI>Norway,</HI> to&s;&s;ed to and fro and pa&s;sing through many &s;tormes at length are ca&s;t vp, or do re&s;t again&s;t this &s;hore. Q. Huge and maruailous great heaps of ice brought hither with the tide from the frozen &s;ea, making a great and terrible noi&s;e; &s;ome pieces of which oft times are fourty cubites bigge; vpon the&s;e in &s;ome places white beares do &s;itte clo&s;ely, watching the &s;illy fi&s;h which heere about do play and &s;port them&s;elues.</P>

<HEAD>RVSSIA, Or rather THE EMPIRE OF THE GRAND DVKE OF MOSCOVIA.</HEAD>
<P>_THis Mappe comprehendeth not all <HI>Ru&s;sia;</HI> for heere are wanting <HI>Polonia</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> which generally are conteined vnder the name of <HI>Ru&s;sia:</HI> But the whole Empire of the Grand Duke of <HI>Mo&s;couia;</HI> which is bounded on the North by the frozen Sea; on the Ea&s;t, vpon the Tartars; on the South, vpon the Turkes and Polanders; on the We&s;t; it abutteth vpon <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Sweden:</HI> all who&s;e countries and prouinces <HI>Sigi&s;mundus Baro</HI> of <HI>Herber|&s;tein</HI> hath &s;euerally and particularly de&s;cribed; vnto whom we &s;end the thir&s;tie Reader for further &s;atisfaction. Of the Religion, habite, manners and kind of life of this Nation; we haue out of him very willingly for thine ea&s;e &s;elected the&s;e few things. In their Religion they do for the mo&s;t part follow the rites and ceremonies of the Greeke Church. Their Prie&s;ts are maried. They haue Images in their Churches. When their children are baptized, three times dipped all ouer into the water; and the water in the font is &s;euerally con|&s;ecrated for euery child. Although by their con&s;titutions and canons they haue a kind of Auricu|lar Confe&s;sion, yet the common people thinketh it to belong only to Princes and Noblemen, and little to pertaine to them. Confe&s;sion being ended, and penance enioined according to the qua|lity of the offence and fault, they &s;igne them in the forehead with the &s;igne of the cro&s;&s;e, and with a loud mournefull voice they crie, Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, thou &s;onne of God, haue mercy vpon vs. This is their common forme and maner of praier: for few can &s;ay the <HI>Pater no&s;ter.</HI> They do communi|cate in the &s;acrament of the &s;upper both kinds, mingling the bread with the wine, or the body with the blood. They admini&s;ter the Lords &s;upper to children of &s;euen yeares old: for then they &s;ay a man doth &s;inne. The better &s;ort of men, after the communion ended, do &s;pend the day in drunkenne&s;&s;e and riot; and do rather reuerence the &s;ame with braue apparell than inward deuo|tion: the ba&s;er &s;ort of people and &s;eruants; for the mo&s;t part, do labour and worke as at other times; &s;aying, that to make holy day to be idle and to leaue their worke, is for gentlemen and ma&s;ters; not for poore folkes and &s;eruants. <HI>Purgatory</HI> they do not beleeue, yet they make pray|ers and do other &s;eruice and ceremonies for the dead. No man doth be&s;prinkle him&s;elfe or &s;uffer any other to ca&s;t holy water vpon him; except the Prie&s;t him&s;elfe will do it. In the Lent they fa&s;t &s;euen whole weekes together. They marry; and do tolerate bigamy or permit a man to haue two wiues, but they make a que&s;tion whether it be a lawfull matrimony or not. They grant di|uorces and &s;eparations. They take it not to be adultery, except one man take another mans wife. The &s;tate of women in this country is mo&s;t mi&s;erable: for they thinke, except &s;hee like a &s;naile do carry her hou&s;e ouer her head, and be continually mewed vp in her clo&s;et, or &s;o watched, that by no meanes &s;he may &s;tart out of doores, none po&s;sibly can be hone&s;t. It is a wilie and deceit|full people, and is rather delighted to liue in &s;eruitude and &s;lauery, than at large and in liberty. All of them do acknowledge them&s;elues to be the Princes &s;eruants. They are &s;eldome quiet: for either they mu&s;t make warres vpon the Lithuans, the Liuonians, or Tartars: or if they be not em|ployed in any &s;eruice in forren warres, they are placed in garri&s;ons about the riuers <HI>Don (Tanais,</HI> the ancients called it) and <HI>Occan,</HI> to repre&s;&s;e the robberies and inua&s;ions of the Tartars. They weare long cleit gownes, without any pleits, with &s;traite &s;leeues after the Hungarian fa&s;hion: bootes al&s;o, for the mo&s;t part red and &s;hort, &s;uch as &s;car&s;e come to their knees, and &s;hoes or clogges clouted and hobbed with iron nailes. They tie their girdles not about their wa&s;ts, but beneath their bellies as low as their hippes. They do &s;euere iu&s;tice vpon freebooters and &s;uch as robbe by the high way &s;ide. Pilfering and man&s;laughter is &s;eldome puni&s;hed by death. Their &s;iluer coines or money, are not round, but &s;omewhat long, of an ouall forme or fa&s;hioned like an egge-like figure. The country aboundeth with tho&s;e rich and pretious skinnes or pelts, which from hence are tran&s;ported and caried all <HI>Europe</HI> ouer; it is almo&s;t euery where full of huge woods. All the&s;e particulars we haue drawen out of the aboue named <HI>Sigi&s;mund.</HI> Many things more of this country thou mai&s;t read of in <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Micou, Alexander Gaguine,</HI> his tract of the <HI>Sarmatiaes, Albert Crantz</HI> his <HI>VVandalia, Paulus Iouius</HI> of the Emba&s;&s;age of the Mo&s;chouites to <HI>Clement</HI> the eight. <HI>Albertus Campen&s;is</HI> vpon the &s;ame, and in the Per&s;ian iourneies of <HI>Ambro&s;io Contareno.</HI> But I would wi&s;h thee al&s;o for farther &s;atisfaction heerein to read ouer the fir&s;t and &s;econd bookes of <HI>Bonfinius</HI> his fir&s;t <HI>Decade</HI> of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Hungary:</HI> as al&s;o the fir&s;t booke of the life of <HI>Ba&s;ilides</HI> written by <HI>O|derborne,</HI> together with the Chronicle of <HI>Saxony</HI> done by <HI>Dauid Chytraeus.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TARTARIA, OR THE EMPIRE OF THE MIGHTIE CHAM.</HEAD>
<P>_HE that will take vpon him to de&s;cribe TARTARIA; he mu&s;t needes &s;peake of a great number of nations, farre a&s;under and remote one from another. For all that huge tract and portion of the Maine land is now called <HI>Tartaria,</HI> that is between the Ea&s;t &s;ea, (or as he calleth it <HI>Mare Mangicum,</HI> the &s;ea of <HI>Mangi</HI> or of <HI>Sin,</HI> a country all the World ouer, and vulgarly knowen by the name of <HI>China</HI>) and the South countries, <HI>Sin</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> that part of <HI>India</HI> which is beyond <HI>Ganges,</HI> the country of the <HI>Saci,</HI> the riuer <HI>Iaxartes,</HI> (now they call it <HI>Che&s;el</HI>) the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> &s;ea, <HI>Mar delle Zabacche (Maeotis palus,</HI> it was called of the ancient writers) and We&s;tward vp as high almo&s;t as the Mo&s;couites. For all the&s;e countries well neere the Tartars did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, and in the&s;e places they were &s;eated. So that it comprehendeth that country which the old Hi&s;toriographers called <HI>Sarmatia</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> both the <HI>Scythiaes</HI> and <HI>Seria,</HI> the country where the <HI>Seres</HI> dwelt, which now I take to be named <HI>Cataio.</HI></P>
<P>The name of this Nation was neuer heard of in <HI>Europe</HI> before the yeare after Chri&s;ts incarnation 1212. They are diuided (in &s;tead of &s;hires) into <HI>Hordaes,</HI> that is, as the word among&s;t them doth &s;ignifie, into companies or couents. But as they do inhabite large and wide countries farre di&s;tant and remote one from another, &s;o in manners and kind of life they are as farre different. They are well limmed men, broad and fatte faced, &s;cowling countenanced and hollow eied, &s;hauen all but their beards, which they neuer cut low: they are &s;trong and of able bodies, and do eat hor&s;e fle&s;h and other bea&s;ts how&s;oeuer they come to their deaths: only hogges excepted, from which they wholly ab&s;taine; they can more ea&s;ily endure hunger and thir&s;t than other men, a little &s;leepe doth &s;erue them: moreouer when they ride, if they be very hungry and thir&s;ty, they v&s;e to pricke the veines of their hor&s;es vpon which they ride, and by drinking of their bloud to &s;lacke their hunger and thir&s;t. And becau&s;e they roue vp and downe and haue no certaine place of abode, they guide their cour&s;e and iourney by the &s;tars, e&s;pecially by the ob&s;eruation of the North pole &s;tarre, which they in their language call, as <HI>Sigi&s;mund Herber&s;tein</HI> te&s;tifieth, <HI>Seles nicol,</HI> that is, the iron clubbe naile, or &s;terne. They &s;tay not long in one place, taking it to be a &s;igne of ill fortune to dwell long vpon one plotte. They ob&s;erue no maner of iu&s;tice or law. The people, e&s;pecially the poorer &s;ort, are very rauenous and couetous; alwaies gaping after other mens goods. They haue no maner of v&s;e either of gold or &s;iluer.</P>
<P>In this country thou &s;ee&s;t TANGVT, a prouince from whence all the <HI>Rheubarbe,</HI> that is &s;pent and v&s;ed in all the world, is brought vnto vs and other places. Heere al&s;o is the country CATAIA, who&s;e chiefe city is <HI>Cambalu,</HI> which, as <HI>Nicolaus de Comitibus</HI> writeth, is eighteen Italian miles about, or as M. <HI>Paulus Venetus,</HI> thirty two. It is of a &s;quare forme, in ech of who&s;e corners there are ca&s;tles built, foure miles in compa&s;&s;e, where continually the Emperours garri&s;ons are kept. But <HI>Quinzai,</HI> a city of the prouince <HI>Mangi,</HI> which is from hence Ea&s;tward, vpon the Ea&s;tern &s;ea, is thought to be farre big|ger than this: For this as the &s;ame M. <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> affirmeth, who dwelt there about the yeare af|ter the birth of Chri&s;t 1260. is in compa&s;&s;e an hundred miles. The &s;ame is al&s;o auouched by <HI>Odericus</HI> of <HI>Friuli (de foro Iulio)</HI> who nameth it <HI>Can&s;ay.</HI> It is &s;ituate in a lake of fre&s;h water. There are in it 1260. bridges, whereof many are of &s;uch great height, that &s;hippes full laden may go vnder them and ne|uer &s;trike &s;aile Heere the Great <HI>Cham</HI> hath a &s;tanding garri&s;on of 12000. trained &s;ouldiers continu|ally re&s;ident. It is a wonderfull &s;tately and plea&s;ant city, whereupon it obtained that name, for <HI>Quinzai,</HI> they interpret, The city of <HI>Heauen.</HI></P>
<P>The Tartars call their Emperour <HI>Cham,</HI> which &s;ignifieth the &s;ame that <HI>Princeps,</HI> a Prince: hereupon <HI>Cambalu</HI> is interpreted, The &s;eate or city of the Prince. <HI>Sigi&s;mundus</HI> of <HI>Herber&s;tein</HI> writeth, that the Tartars do call them&s;elues <HI>Be&s;ermanni.</HI></P>
<P>The Tartars, together with their manner and cour&s;e of life, are mo&s;t liuely de&s;cribed by <HI>Sigi&s;|mund</HI> of <HI>Herber&s;tein</HI> and <HI>Martine Broniouius:</HI> as al&s;o in the Hi&s;toricall Gla&s;&s;e, or Mirour of hi&s;tories, writen by <HI>Vincentius Beluacen&s;is,</HI> in the 30. 31. and 32. bookes of the &s;ame. See al&s;o the commentaries of <HI>Hungary,</HI> written by <HI>Antonio Bonfinio:</HI> M. <HI>Paulus Venetus,</HI> who it is certaine liued long there among&s;t them; and the Iournall or Trauells of <HI>Io&s;apha Barbarus</HI> a Venetian. Of their originall, read <HI>Matthias</HI> of <HI>Michou, Haiton</HI> the Armenian, <HI>Caelius &s;ecundus Curio</HI> his Saracen hi&s;tory, and the letters of <HI>Iacobo Nauarcho</HI> a Ie&s;uite. Of the Tartars there be many things worth the reading in the trauells of two Fri|ars, which about the yeare 1247. were &s;ent into the&s;e quarters, by Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the fourth, in the thirtieth chapter of <HI>Nicephorus</HI> his eigteenth booke. <HI>Laonicus</HI> al&s;o hath many things, in diuers places of his workes, of the Tartars vnder the name of the Scythians: the like hath <HI>Gregoras</HI> another Greeke writer. La&s;tly, <HI>Dauid Chytraeus</HI> in his Saxon chronicle hath written much of this nation. But no man hath more fully and amply &s;et out the maners and life of the Tartars then <HI>William Rubricius,</HI> a Friar of the order of S. <HI>Francis,</HI> a copy of who&s;e trauells into the&s;e parts, in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1253.

<HEAD>CHINA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_BErnardinus Scalantus</HI> hath in the Spani&s;h tongue &s;et out a peculiar de&s;cription of this country in a &s;eue|rall tract, out of whom we haue gathered the&s;e few lines. This huge kingdome of <HI>China,</HI> the inhabi|tants do call TAME, and them&s;elues TANGIS: but of the bordering nations it is named CHINA, and is that <HI>Tein</HI> or <HI>Sin,</HI> which <HI>Auicenna</HI> &s;o many hundred times mentioneth, and commendeth for rare &s;im|ples and plants of &s;oueraigne v&s;e in Phy&s;icke: and is the &s;ame no doubt with SINAE or <HI>Sinarum regio,</HI> a country for rich commodities much talked of among&s;t all ancient Co&s;mographers. This country on the Ea&s;t bordereth vpon the Ea&s;t &s;ea: (vulgarly called <HI>Mare Cin,</HI> the &s;ea of <HI>China</HI>) on the South, vpon the prouince <HI>Cauchinchina:</HI> on the We&s;t, it is bounded by <HI>Bramas:</HI> on the North, it hath the <HI>Tartars,</HI> a warlike and &s;tout people, from whom it is defended and &s;euered partly by an artificiall wall, made by the hand and labour of man, partly by a naturall mountaine which runneth for many hundred miles together between the countries. It is a country very fertile of all maner of things nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of mans life, cau|&s;ed not only by the goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, and temperature of the aire, but e&s;pecially by the husbandry and indu&s;try of the people. For the men heere are not giuen to idlene&s;&s;e, but are very laborious and painefull. To be idle heere it is counted a &s;hamefull thing. It hath wonderfull &s;tore of Gold, Siluer, and Rheubarbe. The &s;ea which beateth vpon this coa&s;t, and the riuers which runne through the midde&s;t of this country, do abound with all &s;orts of fi&s;h. Vpon the mountaines, vales and meddowes infinite flocks of cattell do feed and are maintained. The woods, forre&s;ts and groues are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with Bores, Foxes, Hares, Conies, Zebellines, Martens, and diuers other &s;uch kind of bea&s;ts, who&s;e skins are much &s;et by for facings for gownes. Of all kinds of birds it yeeldeth maruallous plenty, e&s;pecially of water-foule, as is manife&s;t by this, that in <HI>Canton,</HI> which is one of the lea&s;t cities of this prouince, there are &s;pent euery day vpon their Tables tenne or twelue thou&s;and Ducks and Gee&s;e. They &s;ow the drier ground with wheat and barly: the wet, plaine or moori&s;h grounds, withe ri&s;e: which they cut or reap foure times in a yeare: this is their chiefe&s;t diet and liuing. The higher and &s;teep places and &s;ides of hilles are be&s;et with Pine-trees: among&s;t the which they &s;ow panicke, and pul&s;e or hor&s;ecorne. There is no place therefore, no field, no plot of ground vnfruitfull. Euery where are Or|chards, Gardens, Fruits, Ro&s;es, Floures, of all &s;orts yeelding a mo&s;t fragrant and plea&s;ant &s;mell and goodly &s;hew to the beholders. They plant flax in great abundance euery where, whereof they make diuers &s;orts of linnen, whereof they make their apparell: but e&s;pecially Sugar canes, (which heere groweth in maruellous great abundance) and the Mulbery trees for the feeding of their &s;ilke wormes which are maintained with the leaues of this tree. Tor <HI>Silke</HI> is the chife&s;t merchandi&s;e and commodity, whereof they rai&s;e yearely an infinite gaine and profit. There are in this kingdome 240. goodly cities, the names of which do all generally end in the &s;yllable <HI>fu,</HI> which in their language &s;ignifieth a city; as <HI>Cantonfu, Panquinfu.</HI> The townes whereof there is infinite number, they likewi&s;e end in <HI>Cheu.</HI> Villages which are not to be numbred, by rea&s;on of the continuall husbandry and tillage, are very po|pulous and wonderfully inhabited. All their cities for the mo&s;t part, are &s;ituate vpon the banke of &s;ome great and nauigable &s;treame, fortified with broad and deep ditches, and very high &s;trong walles. The&s;e wals from the foundation vpward, are made of &s;tone; toward the toppe and battlement, with bricke, laid in &s;teed of lime and mortar, with lome or potters clay, the &s;ame &s;tuffe, I meane, whereof the <HI>China</HI> di&s;hes, &s;o much e&s;teemed of among&s;t vs, are made. The height of them and thickne&s;&s;e is &s;o great, that fiue or &s;ix men may walke a brea&s;t vpon the toppe of them. Vpon the wall are placed heere and there certaine high towers and bulwarkes, out of which they may &s;ee all the fields ouer farre and neere round about. On ech &s;ide of the wals &s;o much vacant ground (<HI>pomoerium</HI> the Latines call it) is lea&s;t, that hor&s;emen may pa&s;&s;e them &s;ix and &s;ix in a rancke in battell aray. The&s;e wals are &s;o clo&s;e and &s;oundly wrought without any rifts or chinks, that one would thinke them to haue been but newly made, when as their hi&s;tories do te&s;tifie them to haue been built two thou&s;and yeares &s;ince. The entrance into the cities is by great gates mo&s;t won|derfully and &s;tately built. Their &s;treets are as &s;mooth and preci&s;ely plaine, as if they were altogether made by line and leuell, and are &s;o large and broad that tenne yea fifteene hor&s;emen may ride a brea&s;t through them, which in many and &s;undry places are par|ted and &s;euered with &s;tately triumphall arches, gracing the cities beyond all mea&s;ure. Certaine Portugals do report that they &s;aw in the city <HI>Fucho</HI> a turrette, &s;tanding vpon forty marble pillars, who&s;e height were forty hand breadth, and the thickene&s;&s;e twelue after the mea&s;ure which the Architects v&s;e. This, (they affirme in their iudgement) for greatne&s;&s;e, for exqui&s;ite workeman&s;hip, beauty and co&s;tline&s;&s;e, doth farre exceed all the &s;tately buildings of all <HI>Europe.</HI> The greatne&s;&s;e of their cities we do gather by this, that they &s;ay the city <HI>Canton,</HI> which we &s;aid was one of the lea&s;t of their cities, is twelue Engli&s;h miles in compa&s;&s;e; be&s;ide 355. &s;uburbes which do belong to it, very great and populous. The people are broad and round faced, thinne haired, flatte no&s;ed, and &s;mall eied: although there be &s;ome among&s;t them rea&s;onable well fauoured and hand&s;ome men. The colour of their faces is &s;ome|what like that of tho&s;e which inhabite <HI>Europe,</HI> yet tho&s;e which dwell about <HI>Canton</HI> are of a browne complexion. They &s;eldome or neuer trauell further than their owne country, neither will they ea&s;ily &s;uffer a &s;tranger to dwell among&s;t them, e&s;pecially in the vpland places, except they be publikely &s;worne to be true vnto the King and Country. The wealthy and better &s;ort of men haue all their apparell made of &s;ilke of diuers and &s;undry colours. The ba&s;e and meaner &s;ort do weare a kind of &s;tuffe made of white or blacke cotton, and &s;ometime linnen coloured or &s;tained with party colours; for as yet in the&s;e parts they know not how to make wollen cloth. The men there, as women do heere, do weare their haire long, which they winde vp in a knot to the crowne of their head, where they bind and fa&s;ten it with a &s;iluer bodkin. The women comb their haire very trimly, and do behang and &s;et it out with gold &s;pangles and diuers kind of pearles and pretious &s;tones. They paint and be&s;meare their faces with complexion, &s;uch as the Spani&s;h women do commonly v&s;e. They neuer once looke out of dores, except they be carried in their littars vpon mens &s;houlders, and attended by all the family.</P>
<P>It is lawfull for the men to marry many wiues, of which they keep but one in the hou&s;e, the other they maintaine at boord a|broad in other places. Tho&s;e which are conuict of adultery, are put to death. Within the city there may be no &s;tewes, the courti|zanes do liue altogether in the &s;uburbes without the wals. Weddings are alwaies kept in the new moone or beginning of the moneth, and that for the mo&s;t part on the fir&s;t day of <HI>March,</HI> which is their New-yeares-day, or fir&s;t day of the yeare. The&s;e fea&s;ts they &s;et out, like as we al&s;o do, very &s;umptuou&s;ly and with as great preparation and proui&s;ion as may be gotten and diui&s;ed. Their chambers are hanged and &s;pread with hangings of &s;ilke and rich tape&s;try, flowres are &s;trewed and ca&s;t in euery corner. This fea&s;t is held and continued for many daies together. At them they haue mu&s;icke and all &s;orts of in&s;truments, with Interludes and &s;tage plaies. At the&s;e bankets they eat and drinke &s;o &s;oundly, that in this euen the very Dutchmen and Flemings them&s;elues do not much exceed them. Their meat they do not touch with their hands, but with a &s;iluer forke or hooke they put it into their mouthes. They &s;it at their meat or tables in chaires or on &s;tooles, as heere we do in <HI>Europe,</HI> not vpon the ground, as the re&s;t of the A&s;ians v&s;e. It is a very witty and ingenious people, &s;o that they haue deui&s;ed and framed certaine waggons, which they can skil|fully guide in the fields and champion plaines, driuen and forced by &s;ailes and windes, like as &s;hippes are vpon the &s;ea. The&s;e peo|ple haue had the v&s;e and art of Printing of bookes, long before it was knowen to vs heere in <HI>Europe,</HI> the We&s;t part of the world. And there being in this country, by rea&s;on of the largene&s;&s;e of the &s;ame, many and &s;undry people &s;peaking di&s;tinct and different languages, one vnder&s;tanding another no more than the Ca&s;tilliand th the Bi&s;caines, or the Germane doth the Frenchmen; yet by their maner of writing and characters which they all in common do v&s;e, they do one know anothers mind pa&s;&s;ing well. Therefore all the inhabitants of the prouinces of this kingdome, as al&s;o tho&s;e of <HI>Cauchinchina,</HI> and in the <HI>Lequeio's</HI> (certaine ilands vpon this coa&s;t) do v&s;e one and the &s;ame alphabet (as they call it) or rather a kind of draught of letters (not much vnlike the <HI>Hiero|glyphickes,</HI> of the Egyptians) whereby they do mo&s;t cunningly and readily expre&s;&s;e euery thing and phra&s;e or maner of &s;peech.

For they haue in that their alphabet aboue fiue thou&s;and characters of things and words. <HI>Ga&s;par Balbus,</HI> in his Iournall of <HI>India,</HI> writeth, except he ie&s;t, that they haue &s;ixty thou&s;and &s;undry characters. In writing or printing they do not begin at the left hand and &s;o go on to the right, as we do: nor contrariwi&s;e, as the Iewes and Arabians v&s;e; but they begin at the toppe and &s;o write down in a &s;traight line vntill they come to the bottome of the page. This kingdome hath an infinite number of all &s;orts of gallies, boats and barges, whereby they pa&s;&s;e ouer riuers and armes of the &s;ea: &s;o that when they will brag of their Kings wealth and &s;hew his power and command, they v&s;e in a prouerbe to &s;ay, that he can make a bridge of &s;hippes &s;o long that it &s;hall reach from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Malacha:</HI> which are more than 500. leagues a&s;under. For the country abutring vpon the &s;ea, and being euery way and in many places watered and cro&s;&s;ed by diuers great and nauigable riuers, there are almo&s;t as many people that dwell in boats vpon the water, as there do in hou&s;es vpon the land. Some there are, which neuer go out of their boats or barges, but continually &s;taying in them, do by fi&s;hing and fowling get their liuing all the yeare long: for, as we &s;aid before: the abundance of fi&s;h and fowles heere in this country is admirable. Although this prouince be beyond all mea&s;ure fertile of all maner of liuing creatures, yet they do helpe this fertility by art and this &s;trange inuention: In the Spring time they couer two or three thou&s;and egges with hor&s;e dung, (like as they v&s;e in <HI>Alcairo</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI>) by the heat of which, in a certaine time, go&s;lings and chickins are hatched and brought &s;orth. The like they do in the winter, but then they lay them not in dung, but putting them into a basket made of reeds, &amp; &s;o &s;etting them ouer a &s;oft and moderat fire, which they keep continually burning in the &s;ame temper, whereby, in a certaine number of daies, they bring the &s;ame to pa&s;&s;e as afore. They haue al&s;o this kind of fi&s;hing: in tho&s;e cities which &s;tand vpon the bankes and &s;ides of riuers (as almo&s;t all the cities of this kingdome do) they keep a great number of Cormorants or &s;ea-guls (the Latines call them <HI>Mergi,</HI> the Spaniards <HI>Sea crowes</HI>) in cages or coupes: the&s;e, when they li&s;t to go a fi&s;hing, they put into their boats, and carying them to the deepe&s;t places of the riuer, and there binding their necks lightly with cords (lea&s;t that the fi&s;hes which they catch &s;hould go into their bellies) they ca&s;t them by multitudes into the water, where they let them &s;tay &s;o long, vntill they &s;ee their croppes to be filled with fi&s;hes, and then they returning to their boats, they are let in and there they ca&s;t vp at their ma&s;ters feet all the fi&s;h they haue caught. This they do as oft as the fi&s;hermen plea&s;e: and then being brought vnto their coupes, their neckes are vntied, and their ordinary meat is giuen to eat while they will. All this whole country is &s;ubiect to one King, (as to a Mo|narch) whom they call <HI>The Lord of the World,</HI> and <HI>The Sonne of Heauen. Paquin,</HI> a city in the North parts of this kingdome, toward the confines of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> is the &s;eat of their King, where he ordinarily keepeth his Court. Out of this he neuer goeth, except in time of warre. His predece&s;&s;ours did &s;ometime keep their court in the city <HI>Manquin,</HI> for a remembrance whereof a golden Table is there very religiou&s;ly pre&s;erued. In this the name of the King, which now raigneth, is written: before it is hanged a very rich curtaine, which is neuer drawen but vpon fe&s;tiuall and holy daies, when as they do reuerence it very &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly, as if it did indeed repre&s;ent the very Maie&s;ty of the King him&s;elfe. They report that when he maketh warre at any time again&s;t the Tartars, that he leadeth out into the field at the lea&s;t three hundred thou&s;and footmen, and two hundred thou&s;and hor&s;emen: yet this al&s;o they adde, that it is no very warlike Na|tion. The King hath vnder him a gouernour, as it were a lieutenant, whom they call <HI>Tutan.</HI> This lieutenant is the iudge and determi|ner of all cau&s;es and controuer&s;ies ari&s;ing between man and man through-out the whole kingdome. In the execution of iu&s;tice he v&s;eth great &s;euerity. Theeues and murderers are kept in perpetuall impri&s;onment, vntill they end their liues either by whipping, hunger or cold. Although they be condemned to &s;uffer the greate&s;t puni&s;hment that their law doth inflict (which for the mo&s;t part is whipping) yet the execution of the &s;entence is &s;o &s;low, that the greate&s;t part of the&s;e condemned men do die in pri&s;on and neuer come to execution. Hence it is that there euery where in all their cities &s;uch an infinite number of pri&s;oners, &s;o that in <HI>Canton,</HI> one of their lea&s;t cities is there are oftentimes more than fifteen thou&s;and men in pri&s;on at once. Robberies, (than which fault, in the&s;e countries, there is none coun|ted more odious) are puni&s;hed by a cruell kind of whipping. The maner of this whipping is thus: They &s;et the party to be whipped, with his face downe-ward, and his hands bound behind him: then he is beaten with a whippe, made of a reed or cane, vpon the calues of his legges, with &s;uch mighty blowes, that the bloud for the mo&s;t part followeth at the fir&s;t &s;troke; the &s;econd blow doth &s;o torment the party to be puni&s;hed that he cannot po&s;&s;ibly &s;tand vpon his feete any longer. Seuerall hangmen do whip, one one legge, and another another; and that &s;o hard that many do die of the fifteenth or &s;ixteenth la&s;h: for all their &s;inewes are by this time bur&s;t a&s;under. The Portugals do affirme that euery yeare in this country there die aboue two thou&s;and of this kind of death. This whippe is fiue fingers broad, and an inch thicke, which euery foote they dippe in water, to make it the more pliant, and to &s;trike the greater blow.</P>
<P>Concerning the faith and religion of this nation, it is thus: They do beleeue all earthly creatures and all things in the World, and the gouernment and di&s;po&s;ition of them, to depend of <HI>Heauen</HI> and Heauenly powers. For they do thinke that <HI>Heauen</HI> is the greate&s;t of all Gods; and therefore the character of it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the fir&s;t place of their alphabet. They wor&s;hip the Sunne, the Moone and the Stars, yea the very Diuell him&s;elfe, (which they paint in the &s;ame forme, as wee do heere in <HI>Europe</HI>) that hee may do them no hurt, as they &s;ay. They haue &s;tately and &s;umptuous Churches, a&s;well in the country, as in their cities. They haue al&s;o two &s;orts of Prie&s;ts: the one &s;ort go in white, with their heads &s;hauen, and liue by begging, as our Friars do: the other goeth in blacke, wearing their haire long, and dwell by them&s;elues, as our Prie&s;ts v&s;e to do heere in <HI>Europe.</HI> Neither of them may marrie, yet they liue very wantonly and licentiou&s;ly. Thus farre out of <HI>Scalantus.</HI> It will not be ami&s;&s;e to the&s;e to adde &s;ome things out of others. <HI>Iohn Barry</HI> in his A&s;ian Decades giueth out, that this king hath vnder him fifteen very great and large countries; which they call Gouernments. And moreouer he addeth, that this King alone doth farre &s;urpa&s;&s;e all the re&s;t of the Princes of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> round about him: and that his yearely renenews do exceed all the riches and wealth of all <HI>Europe.</HI> For handy-craft trades and occupations they do excell all men liuing, their works are &s;o finely and cun|ningly made, that one would iudge them to haue been framed by nature, and not by art and indu&s;trie of man. At the city <HI>Nimpo,</HI> which others call <HI>Liampo,</HI> he &s;aith it hath been ob&s;erued that &s;ome of the Portugals in the &s;pace of three moneths, haue bought and &s;hipped a|way 166000. pounds of &s;ilke. <HI>Odoardus Barbo&s;a</HI> writeth, that the people are very kind and humane, and go apparelled much like the Dutchmen, whom al&s;o they do much re&s;emble in pronunciation and maner of &s;peech. Tho&s;e cleare and tran&s;parent ve&s;&s;els, or di&s;hes as white as the drift &s;now, which among&s;t vs are of &s;uch great e&s;timation, are heere made in this maner: They mingle certaine cochle|&s;hels eg-&s;hels &amp; other things together, which they knead &amp; make into a pa&s;te. This pa&s;te they hide in the earth, where they let it li for the &s;pace of foure&s;core, or an hundred yeares, before they &s;tirre it or looke to it again, leauing it, as a great inheritance or pretious iewell, vnto their heires. That pa&s;te they v&s;e which their grandfathers or great grandfathers haue laied vp for them. And they do ob&s;erue duely by an ancient cu&s;tome, that he which taketh away the old pa&s;te, do put new pre&s;ently in his place. <HI>Antony Pigafetta,</HI> calleth this King the mo&s;t mighty Prince of the whole world. He &s;aith that his palace, or hou&s;e where he keepeth his Court, is enclo&s;ed with 7. wals; and that he hath alwaies 10000. &s;ouldiers for his gard continually there attendant vpon him: and that 70. crowned Kings do homage vnto him and are &s;ubiect to his gouernment and command. The &s;ame authour affirmeth that <HI>Muske</HI> is from hence tran&s;ported into diuers parts of the world. <HI>Andrew Cor&s;alis</HI> he likewi&s;e &s;aith that the greate&s;t &s;tore of <HI>Rheubarbe</HI> and <HI>Pearle</HI> that is brought hither to vs in <HI>Europe,</HI> doth come from hence.</P>
<P>In the Ie&s;uites Epi&s;tles lately &s;et forth in print, many things well worth the ob&s;eruation are heere and there &s;et downe of this country. That of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> the&s;e people were called SINAE, the &s;ituation doth plainly proue, neither doth the name yet retained much differ from that. For the Spaniards and Portugals do write it <HI>Ch na,</HI> yet they pronounce it <HI>Sina.</HI> Of the &s;ituation and nature of this country, the be|hauiours and maners of the people, you may read in a worke of <HI>Iohn Gon&s;alis</HI> &s;et forth of this argument.

<HEAD>The Ile IAPAN, OR IAPONIA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_IOhn Peter Maffey,</HI> in the twelfth booke of his hi&s;tory of <HI>India</HI> doth thus write of this iland: They are e&s;pecially three greater ilands, with many other &s;maller round about them, di&s;ioined one from another by very narrow &s;traits or armes of the &s;ea, that are called by the name of IAPAN or <HI>Iaponia.</HI> The fir&s;t and the greate&s;t is diuided into three and fifty &s;igniories or kingdomes: the head and chiefe city of this is <HI>Meaco,</HI> whereof this whole iland taketh his name. The &s;econd is named <HI>Ximen,</HI> and conteineth nine kingdomes: the more famous cities of the kingdome of <HI>Bungo,</HI> are <HI>Vo&s;uqui</HI> and <HI>Funay.</HI> The third iland is called <HI>Xicocum:</HI> it conteineth not aboue foure kingdomes or &s;ignio|ries: it is beautified with the goodly city <HI>Ton&s;a (To&s;a</HI> he calleth it) of the &s;ame name with the king|dome: Thus the regiments or kingdomes of <HI>Iapan</HI> are in all generally &s;ixty and &s;ix; be&s;ide diuers other iuri&s;dictions which cannot iu&s;tly be called kingdomes. The length of the whole maine land is, as they &s;ay, almo&s;t two hundred leagues: the breadth is nothing &s;o much: for in &s;ome places it is not aboue tenne leagues broad: at the mo&s;t it is not aboue thirty leagues ouer. Of the compa&s;&s;e there is nothing certainly written that I know of. It runneth out from the South toward the North from the thirty degree of latitude almo&s;t to the thirty and eight. Vpon the Ea&s;t it is oppo&s;ite to <HI>New-Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ne,</HI> remote from it not aboue 150. leagues. Vpon the North it hath the Scythians or Tartari|ans, and other &s;uch people exceeding rude and barbarous. On the We&s;t lieth <HI>China, (Sinarum regno)</HI> in &s;ome place neerer, in &s;ome place further off, according to the diuers windings and bendings of the &s;hore: for from the city <HI>Liampo,</HI> which is the vt|termo&s;t bound of <HI>China,</HI> toward the We&s;t, vnto <HI>Gotum, (Ogoto,</HI> I thinke) which is the fir&s;t Iland of all <HI>Iapan</HI> that offereth it &s;elfe to the view of tho&s;e which &s;aile from thence hitherward, is not aboue three&s;core leagues but from <HI>Amacan,</HI> a mart town in the We&s;t, where the Portugals for the mo&s;t part do altogether v&s;e to trade, vnto the &s;ame <HI>Gotum,</HI> the cutte is 297. leagues ouer. On the South, neere hand it hath naught but the va&s;t and wide Ocean; further off, certaine lands and countries not yet de&s;cried or knowne, out of which, the report goeth, that certaine &s;ailours came once by chance vnto <HI>Iapan,</HI> and neuer put off from thence any more to returne backe to their natiue &s;oile. The country for the mo&s;t part is full of &s;now all the yeare long, bleake and cold, and therefore not very fertile. In September they cut downe their ri&s;e, in &s;ome places they reap their wheat in May: (for this generally is the v&s;uall food throughout the whole country) yet they make no bread of it, as we v&s;e heere in <HI>Europe,</HI> but a kind of pudding or pappe, which they eat in &s;tead of bread. The temperature of the aire is very kind and whole|&s;ome: their fre&s;h waters are pa&s;&s;ing good: they haue al&s;o &s;ome bathes or &s;prings of hot waters of &s;oueraigne vertues in Phy|&s;icke, as &s;ome do con&s;tantly report. High and &s;teep mountaines they haue many heere and there, but two are e&s;pecially fa|mous, the one of which, who&s;e name I know not, doth continually burne and ca&s;t out flames of fire, as <HI>Aetna</HI> in <HI>Sicilia</HI> was wont to do, and as <HI>Hecla</HI> in <HI>I&s;land</HI> now v&s;ually doth at certaine times. In the toppe of this mountaine, the Diuell, enclo&s;ed in a white clowd, &s;heweth him&s;elfe to certaine men, after that for deuotions &s;ake they haue long fa&s;ted and pined them&s;elues. The other, called <HI>Figenoiama,</HI> ari&s;eth vp certaine leagues aboue the cloudes. The people do digge &s;undry &s;orts of mettals out of the bowels of the earth, whereby they intice forren Nations to come from farre vnto their quarters. Trees they haue both for plea&s;ure and for profit or fruit not much vnlike ours heere in <HI>Europe:</HI> yet there is one tree, which doth much re&s;emble the Palme-tree, who&s;e nature is very &s;trange: for, as they affirme, it is afraid of any maner of moi&s;ture: and if &s;o be by chance it happen to be wette, it &s;hrinketh together, and as if it had been infected with the plague, &s;mitten or bla&s;ted, it withereth and dieth immediately. The helpe and meanes to recouer it againe, is to plucke it vp by the roots and to drie it in the &s;unne: then to lay it in a dry ditch or empty pit, and to couer it all ouer, either with the ru&s;t of iron beaten to powder, or el&s;e with &s;and: there, after it is planted and &s;et into the ground againe, it groweth and buddeth as afore, and &s;o it flouri&s;heth and becommeth as trimme and beautifull as euer it was: the boughes al&s;o that fall off, or are broken off, if they be fa&s;tened with a naile vnto the &s;tocke or body of the tree, they will grow and ioine to the &s;ame a&s;well as if they had beene grafted into it. Heere are euery where great &s;tore of Cedar trees, of &s;uch height and thickene&s;&s;e, that hereof the carpenters make &s;ummers for hou&s;es, pillars and columnes for &s;tately buildings, and the &s;hipwrights ma&s;ts for the tale&s;t and greate&s;t &s;hippes of burden that in tho&s;e quar|ters they v&s;ually make. Sheep, hogges, hennes, ducks, gee&s;e, and &s;uch other filthy kinds of liuing creatures they &s;eldome or neuer keep at home about their hou&s;es: if they plea&s;e to eat fle&s;h meat, they only eat veni&s;on, and &s;uch as they catch abroad in the wild fields. The fields are be&s;pread with many heards of cattell, as kine and hor&s;es for &s;eruice in the warres: in the forre&s;ts, woods and bu&s;hie grounds, woolues, conies, bores, &s;tagges and other deere do wander vp and downe: they haue plenty of phe&s;ants, wild ducks, &s;tock-doues, quailes and wild hennes: fi&s;hes of diuers &s;orts, but e&s;pecially of riuer trouts, (or &s;ilares as &s;ome call them) as al&s;o of &s;ea troutes which is not vnlike that kind of fi&s;h which <HI>Au&s;onius</HI> nameth <HI>Alo&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Pliny Clupea</HI> or <HI>Clypea,</HI> in the fifteenth chapter of his ninth booke: this they &s;et great &s;tore by and do account it for a dainty di&s;h. They know not what butter meaneth; oile of oliues they haue none; but they make a kind of artificiall oile of the Whales which they catch or are ca&s;t vp vpon this &s;hore: the common &s;ort of people do v&s;e mo&s;t what boughs or &s;ticks of pine-trees, in &s;ome place &s;traw and hawme, in &s;teed of candles. If any one be tall or properly made, he is not a little proud of it. Many of them liue long, and are &s;trong and lu&s;ty euen to the la&s;t, &s;o that the mo&s;t of them are fit for the warres till they be three&s;core yeares old. They weare their beards &s;hort: but in the re&s;t of their haire they are very curious and haue diuers and &s;undry cuttes: they &s;haue them not, but plucke them off with pulle&s;ans or pin&s;ers; the Boies do bare their heads from the forehead euen vp to the crowne: the ba&s;er &s;ort of people and the clownes, the one halfe of the &s;ame: the gentlemen and noblemen, almo&s;t all ouer, onely leauing a few haires behind about the nape of the necke, which they hold for a great di&s;grace if any man &s;hall lay hand vpon, or once offer to touch. Hunger, thir&s;t, heat, cold, labour and &s;uch like inconueniences, that do much trouble other men, they can well away withall and mo&s;t patiently endure. As &s;oone as euer they be borne and come into the world, al|though it be in the midde winter, they be &s;traight caried to a riuer to be wa&s;hed: being weaned and taken from the brea&s;t, they are exerci&s;ed in hunting, and are kept apart in rough and craggy places farre from their mothers and nurces wings; for they thinke that there is nothing that doth more effeminate the minds of men, than too tender and delicate bringing vp. They be&s;pread and couer the floores of their hou&s;es with fine and neat mattes, ri&s;ing and &s;welling as matrices or flockebeds. Vpon the&s;e, laying a &s;tone or blocket vnder their heads, in &s;teed of a pillow, they &s;leep and take their re&s;t: and vpon the &s;ame, kneeling vpon their knees and &s;itting vpon their legges, they dine and &s;uppe. They are as neat and cleanly as tho&s;e of <HI>China:</HI> at their meat they do &s;o cunningly put their meat into their mouthes with two little pricks or forkes, that they neuer droppe or let ought fall be&s;ide, nor need once to wipe their fingers. They put off their &s;hoes when they go to meat, lea&s;t they &s;hould &s;oile their carpets by treading vpon them The poorer &s;ort, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that dwell vpon the &s;ea, do liue by herbs, ri&s;e, and fi&s;h: the wealthier &s;ort do &s;et out their banquets richly and with great variety of di&s;hes: at euery me&s;&s;e ech mans trencher

<PB REF="226"> made of Cedar, or Pine-wood, of an handfull thicke, is changed without table-clothes or napkins. The meats, when they are to be &s;et vpon the table, are built, or laid vpon another informe of a &s;teeple or pyramis, be&s;trewed with gold, and &s;tucke and &s;et out for a &s;hew with branches of the Cypre&s;&s;e tree, like as we v&s;e to do with Ro&s;e-mary. Many times whole fowles are brought to Noblemens tables, with their bils and legs gilt all ouer. They intertaine their friends and gue&s;ts very kindlie and bountifullie. They haue many orders and lawes of fea&s;ting and drinking, which are performed very curiou&s;lie &amp; with &s;trange and exqui&s;ite ceremonies. They haue no manner of wine, nor vines among&s;t them. A kind of artificiall wine they make and pre&s;&s;e out of ri&s;e: yet they are e&s;pecially delighted, more than with any other kind of liquor, to drink water almo&s;t &s;calding hot, putting it into the powder of an hearb which they call <HI>Chia,</HI> (it is a very whole&s;ome hearb of &s;oueraigne vertues) this kind of drinke they v&s;e often and are curious in the making of it; &s;o that many times Princes and Noblemen, will dre&s;&s;e, prepare and mingle it with their owne hands, for an honour and grace vnto their friends: and they haue certaine places in their hou&s;es a&s;&s;igned to this purpo&s;e: in which there is a furnace or fire kindled at all times readie, with a kettle of ca&s;t iron continually hanging ouer the &s;ame: from hence they fetch drinke to entertaine their friends at their fir&s;t comming to their hou&s;e, and for their farewell at their departure: when their gue&s;ts are to depart, they &s;hew them all their trea&s;ure and hou&s;hold-&s;tuffe which they do e&s;pecially e&s;teeme; which for the mo&s;t part is nothing el&s;e but tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els and in&s;truments belonging to the making of the drinke which I &s;pake of before, namely the furnace or hearth, the panne or kettle with the trefeet, the tunnell, the drink|ing cuppes or earthen pots, the &s;poones, and the boxes wherein they keep the hearb and the powder made of the &s;ame. The&s;e things they &s;et little le&s;&s;e &s;tore by, than we do heere in <HI>Europe</HI> by rings be&s;et with pretious &s;tones or bracelets of the be&s;t and mo&s;t orient pearles. Their hou&s;es for the mo&s;t part are framed of timber, to auoid the danger of earth-quakes, which heere are very frequent and often, although that &s;ome haue their hou&s;es very artificially and &s;tately built from the foundation vpward of a very faire kind of &s;tone. They haue many goodly Churches, and Mona&s;teries both of men and wo|men, very rich and &s;umptuous. The language of all the&s;e ilands is one and the &s;ame, but &s;o diuers and manifold, and of &s;uch different dialects, that it may not vniu&s;tly be &s;aid to be many. For they haue of one and the &s;ame thing diuers and &s;undrie names, of which &s;ome are v&s;ed in &s;corne and bad &s;en&s;e, others in good &s;en&s;e and honourable v&s;age: other phra&s;es and words are v&s;ed by the Nobility, others by the common people: others are &s;poken by the men, others by the women. Moreouer, they &s;peake otherwi&s;e than they write: and in their writing there is a great variety, for they write their priuate letters vnto their friends one way, and bookes and &s;uch like another way. They haue diuers bookes, very fairely written, both in ver&s;e and in pro&s;e. Againe, their letters are &s;uch, as in one and the &s;ame character they do expre&s;&s;e and &s;ignifie &s;ometime one word, &s;ometime two or more. La&s;tly, the Iaponian language is, of indifferent iudges, preferred before the Latine, either in re&s;pect of the elegancy and &s;moothne&s;&s;e of pronunciation, or copy and variety of the &s;ame: therefore it requireth both great time and labour to learne it. They are a very warlike people and much giuen to follow that kind of life: the chiefe men of dignitie, which haue the command of the kingdome and gouernment of the &s;ame, they generally call <HI>Tonos;</HI> although among&s;t tho&s;e there are al&s;o certaine degrees, as there are among&s;t our Nobility, Princes, Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earles, and Barons. Another &s;ort of men there are among&s;t them, which haue the charge and managing of matters of their Church: the&s;e are &s;hauen all ouer both head and beard: the&s;e may neuer marrie, but do vow perpetuall cha&s;tity. There are diuers and &s;undrie &s;ects of the&s;e religious per&s;ons among&s;t them: &s;ome there are which after the maner of the Knights of the Rhodes, do iointly profe&s;&s;e armes and religion together, but they are generally called by one name, <HI>Bonzij.</HI> They haue in many places diuers great &s;chooles, &s;uch as we call Vniuer&s;ities. The third &s;tate or &s;ort of people among&s;t them, are the citizens and other degrees of gentry: next vnto the&s;e are the retalers, huck&s;ters, factours, and &s;hop-keepers: with artificers and handiecraft-men, of diuers occupations, very ingenious and skilfull in their trades. They haue many kinds of armours and warlike weapons, made of &s;undrie makings, and excellent temper. They haue al&s;o the v&s;e of Printing with letters and &s;tamps, not much vnlike our ma|ner inuented and practi&s;ed heere in <HI>Europe.</HI> The la&s;t &s;ort and &s;tate of people in the&s;e ilands, are the husbandmen and labou|rers. Generally it is a very &s;ubtile, wittie and wi&s;e Nation, and of &s;ingular endowments and good parts of nature, both for acute iudgement, aptne&s;&s;e of learning, and excellency of memorie. It is no &s;hame or reproach to any to be accounted poore. Slaunderous and railing &s;peeches, theeuing, robberies and that vngodlie kind of ra&s;h othes and &s;wearing, with all kind of di|cing and gaming, they do vtterly abhorre and dete&s;t. Any offendours again&s;t the Law, of what degree &s;oeuer, are puni&s;hed by no le&s;&s;e puni&s;hment, than bani&s;hment, confi&s;cation of goods or death. Tho&s;e which are to be executed are for the mo&s;t part beheaded &s;uddenlie before they are aware. Notwith&s;tanding it is the maner in &s;ome places to cary, &s;uch as are taken for robberies, in a certaine kind of carre round about the city, in the face of all the people, and to hang them vp without the wals of the towne. In the &s;eruice of God, which is the chiefe point of iu&s;tice and vertue, they do mi&s;erably erre and &s;warue from the right tract. Their guides and great ma&s;ters of religion to informe the re&s;t, are tho&s;e which I &s;ay they name <HI>Bonzij.</HI> A|mong&s;t their &s;aints which they wor&s;hip, the chiefe are tho&s;e which they call <HI>Amida</HI> and <HI>Xaca:</HI> other idols they haue of le&s;&s;e e&s;timation and note among&s;t them, whom they pray vnto for health, recouery in &s;ickene&s;&s;e, children, money, &amp; other things belonging to the body: the&s;e they call <HI>Camis.</HI> All <HI>Iaponia,</HI> or the people of that name, were &s;ubiect in time pa&s;t vnto one Em|perour, whom they called <HI>Vo</HI> or <HI>Dair,</HI> (this was his title of honour and dignity) vntill &s;uch time as he growen effeminate and giuen to plea&s;ures and ea&s;e, became to be &s;corned and contemned by the Lieutenants and Nobility, e&s;pecially of the <HI>Cubi</HI> (for &s;o they called the two chiefe&s;t Princes vnto whom the gouernment of the country was committed, of which afterward the one did kill the other) therefore the Lieutenants of the &s;euerall &s;hires, with the military men, hauing for a time endured &s;uch a carpet Knight, by and by began to loath his gouernment, and at la&s;t wholly &s;haking off the yoke of &s;ubiection, &s;ei&s;ed euery man into his owne hand the prouince ouer which he was &s;et as gouernour vnder the Emperour: &s;o at an in&s;tant that vnited body and maine Empire of &s;o large command, was &s;hattered as it were into many parts and pieces: yet &s;o as notwith&s;tanding a kind of &s;oueraigne authority doth euen to this day remaine in the <HI>Dair,</HI> of di&s;tributing and giuing the titles of honour to the Nobility, which eft&s;oones are altered according to the diuer&s;ity of the degrees, and are de&s;igned by certaine notes and bad|ges. The chiefe and mo&s;t mightie of all the Princes of <HI>Iaponia</HI> is he that gat either by force or policy <HI>Meacum,</HI> and the be&s;t kingdomes neere to the &s;ame, which they generally by one name do vulgarly call <HI>Ten&s;a.</HI> Tho&s;e places were lately po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by <HI>Nubunanga,</HI> that tyrant which I &s;pake of before: this King being &s;laine by trea&s;on about two yeares before, and his chil|dren murdered or bani&s;hed, one <HI>Faxiba</HI> a chiefe captaine of the rebels, by force and violence &s;tepped into his regall throne, and tooke vpon him to &s;way the &s;cepter of that kingdome.</P>
<P>The honour and credit of the fir&s;t entrance of this Iland certaine Portugals do challenge and take vnto them&s;elues, but I do rather giue credit to <HI>Antonio Gaualno,</HI> who reporteth, in that booke which he wrote of the de&s;cries of the New-found world, that <HI>Anton<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">o Mota, Franci&s;co Zeimoro,</HI> and <HI>Antonio Pexoto,</HI> in their iourney as they &s;ailed from the city <HI>Dodra</HI> in <HI>Sion,</HI> to pa&s;&s;e for <HI>China,</HI> they were caried by a contrary wind to the Ilands of the Iaponians, about two and forty yeares before that time. All this we haue extracted out of the forenamed <HI>Maffeius,</HI> who handleth them more at large, with many other things of the&s;e Ilands of <HI>Iaponia.</HI> Of the &s;ame there are heere and there many things in the Ie&s;uites Epi&s;tles.</P>

<HEAD>INDIA.</HEAD>
<P>_THat there is not a more goodly and famous country in the world, nor larger, comprehen|ded vnder one and the &s;ame name than INDIA, almo&s;t all writers iointly with one con|&s;ent haue affirmed. It was &s;o named of the riuer <HI>Indus.</HI> The whole compa&s;&s;e of <HI>India</HI> by the iudgement of <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> is thus limited: vpon the We&s;t, it hath the riuer <HI>Indus;</HI> on the North, the great mountaine <HI>Taurus;</HI> on the Ea&s;t, the Ea&s;tern &s;ea, wherein tho&s;e fa|mous Ilands, the <HI>Moluccaes,</HI> do lie; on the South, it hath the Indian &s;ea. In the midde&s;t it is diuided into two large prouinces by the goodly riuer <HI>Ganges.</HI> Of which that which is on the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Ganges,</HI> is called <HI>India intra Gangem, India</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Ganges:</HI> that on the Ea&s;t, <HI>India extra Gangem, India</HI> beyond <HI>Ganges.</HI> That in holy Scripture it is called EVILAT or <HI>Hauila:</HI> this latter &s;ome writers call SERIA, the country of the <HI>Seres,</HI> as <HI>Dominicus Niger</HI> te&s;tifieth. M. <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> &s;eemeth to diuide it into three prouinces, the <HI>Greater,</HI> the <HI>Le&s;&s;er,</HI> and the <HI>Middlemo&s;t;</HI> which he &s;aith they name <HI>Aba&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>This whole country generally, not only for multitude of nations (of which, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> writeth, it is mo&s;t populous and be&s;t &s;tored of any country in the world) and for townes and villages almo&s;t infinite, but for the great abundance of all commodities (only bra&s;&s;e and lead excepted, if one may giue credit to <HI>Pliny</HI>) is mo&s;t rich and fortunate. It hath very many riuers, and tho&s;e very great and faire. The&s;e running to and fro and in many places cro&s;sing and watering the &s;ame, do cau&s;e it, as in a moi&s;t &s;oile, where the &s;unne is of force, to bring forth all things mo&s;t plentifully. It &s;toreth all the world with Spices, Pearles and Pretious &s;tones, as hauing greater plenty of the&s;e commodities than all the countries of the whole world be&s;ides.</P>
<P>There are neere vnto this country many goodly ilands, which heere and there lie &s;cattering in the maine Ocean, &s;o that it may iu&s;tly be tearmed the <HI>World of Ilands.</HI> But e&s;pecially IAPAN, which M. <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> calleth <HI>Zipangri,</HI> &s;ituate in this &s;ea, is worth the noting: which, becau&s;e it is not many yeares &s;ince that it was knowen to few or none, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to &s;ay &s;omething of it in this place. It is a very large and wide iland, and hath almo&s;t the &s;ame eleuation of the Northren pole and po&s;ition from the South with <HI>Italy.</HI> The Ilanders and people heere inhabiting, are much giuen to learning, wi&s;edome and religion: and are mo&s;t earne&s;t and diligent &s;ear|chers out of the truth in naturall cau&s;es. They v&s;e to pray and &s;ay &s;eruice oft, which they do in their Churches in the &s;ame maner as the Chri&s;tians do. They haue but one King, vnto whom they are &s;ubiect and do nothing but according to his behe&s;ts and lawes. Yet he al&s;o hath one aboue him, whom they call <HI>Voo,</HI> to whom the or|dering of Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall matters &amp; gouernment of the &s;tate of the Church is &s;oly committed. This peraduenture we may not vnfitly compare to the Pope, as their King to the Emperour. To their Bi&s;hop they commit the &s;al|uation and care of their &s;oules. They wor&s;hip only one God, protraitured with three heads, yet they can &s;hew no rea&s;on of this act. They baptize their infants: by fa&s;ting, in token of penance, they labour to bring downe their bodies. They cro&s;&s;e and ble&s;&s;e them&s;elues with the &s;igne of the cro&s;&s;e, again&s;t the a&s;&s;ault of Satan: &s;o that in religion, certaine ceremonies, and maner of liuing they &s;eeme to imitate the Chri&s;tians: yet notwith&s;tanding the order of the Ie&s;uites labour by all meanes po&s;sibly they can, not refu&s;ing any paines and trauell, to reduce them wholly to Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Heere are al&s;o the MOLVCCAE, certaine ilands famous for the abundance of &s;pices which they yearly yeeld and &s;end into all quarters of the world. In the&s;e is bred the <HI>Manucodiatta,</HI> a little bird which we call the bird of Paradi&s;e, a &s;trange fowle no where els euer &s;een. More neere the coa&s;t of <HI>India,</HI> is SVMATRA, or rather <HI>Samotra,</HI> for &s;o the King him&s;elfe of that country, writeth it, in his letters vnto his Maie&s;ty: this Iland was knowen to the ancient Geographers and Hi&s;torians by the name of TAPROBANA. There are al&s;o diuers other Ilands heere|about of great e&s;timation and fame, as <HI>Iaua Maior, Iaua Minor, Borneo, Timor &amp;c.</HI> as thou mai&s;t &s;ee in the Mappe, but we cannot in this place &s;peake of euery thing particularly and to the full. Thus farre the religion of Maho|met is profe&s;&s;ed, and from <HI>Barbary</HI> ouer again&s;t <HI>Spaine,</HI> euen vnto this place is the Arabicke language &s;poken or vnder&s;tood. The Moores from <HI>Marrocco,</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours to our late Queene &s;ome fiue yeares &s;ince, we &s;aw and heard them &s;peake that tongue naturally, in which al&s;o their commi&s;sion or letters patents were written: From <HI>Achem</HI> in <HI>Samotra,</HI> and <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>Iaua Maior</HI> our Merchants, this other day brought letters vnto his Highne&s;&s;e, &s;o fairely and curiou&s;ly written in that character and language, as no man will &s;carcely beleeue but he that hath &s;een them, e&s;pecially from &s;o barbarous and rude a Nation.</P>
<P>Of the ancient writers <HI>Diodorus Siculus, Herodotus, Pliny, Strabo, Quintus Curtius</HI> and <HI>Arrianus</HI> in the life of <HI>Alexan|der,</HI> haue de&s;cribed the <HI>Indies.</HI> So hath <HI>Apuleius</HI> al&s;o in the fir&s;t booke of his <HI>Floridorum. Dion Pru&s;aeus</HI> in his 35. ora|tion hath written much of this country, but very fabulou&s;ly. There is al&s;o extant an Epi&s;tle of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, written to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> of the &s;ituation of <HI>India.</HI> Of the latter writers <HI>Ludouicus Vartomannus, Maximilianus Tran&s;|&s;iluanus, Iohannes Barrius</HI> in his Decades of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Co&s;mas Indopleutes,</HI> whom <HI>Petrus Gyllius</HI> doth cite, haue done the &s;ame. But &s;ee the Ie&s;uites Epi&s;tles, where thou &s;halt find many things making much for the di&s;couery of the ile <HI>Iapan.</HI> But if thou de&s;ire a full and ab&s;olute de&s;cription of the &s;ame, I would wi&s;h thee to haue recour&s;e vnto the twelfth booke of <HI>Maffeius</HI> his Indian hi&s;tory. <HI>Iohn Macer,</HI> a Ciuillian hath al&s;o written bookes of the hi&s;tory of <HI>India,</HI> in which he hath much of the ile <HI>Iaua.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Ca&s;tagnedo</HI> a Spaniard, hath written in the Spani&s;h tongue a di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Indies.</HI> Of the ilands which lie &s;cattering heere and there in this ocean, read the twentieth booke of the &s;econd Tome of <HI>Gon&s;aluo Ouetani,</HI> written in like maner in the Spani&s;h tongue.</P>

<P>_THe Empire of the Per&s;ians as it hath alwaies in former ages been mo&s;t famous, &s;o at this day &s;till it is very renowmed, knowen farre and neere, and conteineth ma|ny large and goodly prouinces: For all that whole tract of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> comprehended be|tween the great riuer <HI>Tigris,</HI> the Per&s;ian gulfe, the Indian (which of old writers was called <HI>mare Rubrum,</HI> the Red &s;ea) the riuers <HI>Indus</HI> and <HI>Iaxartes</HI> (they now call it <HI>Che&s;el</HI>) and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, is now in the&s;e our daies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Sophies,</HI> the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> All which tract of ground <HI>Pliny</HI> in the 27. chapter of his 6. booke of the hi&s;tory of Nature, by the iudgement of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> a&s;signeth to the Medes, Parthians, and Per&s;i|ans.

<P>Of the originall of the SOPHIES, the&s;e particulars following, <HI>Caelius Secundus Curio,</HI> hath tran&s;lated in his Saracen hi&s;tory, out of the Decades of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> written by <HI>Iohn Barrius:</HI> In the yeare of Chri&s;t 1369. there was a certaine pety king among&s;t the Per&s;ians, named <HI>Sophi,</HI> who held the city <HI>Ardenelim</HI> in his po&s;&s;e&s;sion. This man bragged that he was de&s;cended lineally by his ance&s;tours from <HI>Mu&s;a Cazino,</HI> nephew of <HI>Alij Muha|med.</HI> He, the Chalife of <HI>Babylon</HI> being dead, &amp; the contrary faction maintained by the Turkes, &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the Tartars, began more boldly and freely to broach his opinions of religion: and becau&s;e that <HI>Hocemus,</HI> the &s;onne <HI>Aly,</HI> from whom he draweth his pedigree, had twelue &s;onnes, minding to &s;et &s;ome marke or badge vpon his &s;ect and di&s;ciples, whereby they might be di&s;tingui&s;hed and knowen from others, he ordained that they that would follow him, and be of his religion, &s;hould weare a tire vnder the vaile, which all the Turkes do wind about their heads (they call it <HI>Tulibant</HI>) &s;hould be of a purple colour, and &s;hould hang out at the midde&s;t of the <HI>Tulibant</HI> twelue hand breadth. After his death <HI>Guines</HI> his &s;onne &s;ucceeded in his &s;teed: who did purcha&s;e vnto him&s;elfe &s;uch an opinion of learning, religion and holine&s;&s;e throughout all the Ea&s;tern countries of the World, that <HI>Tamerlanes,</HI> that worthy and famous Emperour of the Parthians, (who ouercame <HI>Bayazet,</HI> the great Turke, and defeating all his forces, tooke him captiue) trauelling through <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> determined to vi&s;ite him as a mo&s;t holy and religious Saint. To <HI>Guines, Tamerlanes</HI> freely gaue thirtie thou&s;and captiues, which he brought thither with him: the&s;e <HI>Guines</HI> afterward trained vp in his religion; who&s;e &s;eruice <HI>Secaidar</HI> his &s;onne, e&s;pecially v&s;ed in his warres: For he, after that <HI>Guines</HI> his father was dead, made warre vpon the Georgians, his neighbours bordering vpon his kingdome and countries, a kind of people of <HI>Scythia,</HI> but Chri&s;tians by profe&s;sion, and by the help of the&s;e Mu&s;&s;ulmanes, grieuou&s;ly vexed them many kind of waies &amp;c. Let this &s;atisfie thee in this place to be &s;poken of the originall of the <HI>Sophies.</HI> The&s;e do make continuall warre with the Turkes about the Mahumetane religion: for becau&s;e the <HI>Sophies</HI> do follow one interpretour of the Alkora'n and Mahometan religion, and the Turkes another, which in|terpretours and expo&s;itours do much di&s;&s;ent and vary one from the other, &s;o that the Sophians by the Turkes are counted but as Heretiques, and contrariwi&s;e the Turkes are e&s;teemed for no le&s;&s;e by the Sophi|ans. It is by nature a Gentleman-like and honourable Nation, very ciuill and curteous, louing learning and liberall &s;ciences, and withall do much e&s;teeme of Nobility and Noble-men: in that are cleane contrary and oppo&s;ite to the Turkes, which do not acknowledge or regard any difference of bloud or de&s;cent from fa|mous ance&s;tours and great hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the&s;e countries, the maners, cu&s;tomes and behauiour of the people of the &s;ame, thou mai&s;t read of in <HI>Aloy&s;ius Iohannes Venetus, Io&s;aphat Barbarus, Ambro&s;ius Contarenus, Iohannes Maria Angiolellus,</HI> and a certaine Merchants trauels, who&s;e name I know not, together with them imprinted.

<HEAD>The Empire of the Great TVRKE.</HEAD>
<P>_OF the originall and beginning of the Turki&s;h Empire, the encrea&s;ing and grow'th of the &s;ame, vntill it came by little and little to that greatne&s;&s;e that now it is of, whereby it is fearefull to all nations round about, we haue gathered the&s;e few lines out of the be&s;t Hi&s;toriographers of our time. In the yeare of Chri&s;t 1300. one OTTOMAN|NVS a Turke, the &s;onne of <HI>Zichi,</HI> a man of meane parentage, began for his pregnant witte and great experience in feats of armes and di&s;cipline of warre, to grow famous and renowmed among&s;t the Turkes. Of this man the &s;tocke of the Turki&s;h Empe|rours fir&s;t tooke their name and beginning, and he was the fir&s;t that ordeined a king ouer the Turkes. He raigned &s;euen and twenty yeares, in which &s;pace he conquered all <HI>Bithynia</HI> and <HI>Cappa|docia,</HI> and &s;ubdued many &s;trong holds neere vnto <HI>Mar Maiore,</HI> or the great &s;ea; &s;o now the Italians call that &s;ea which the old writers call <HI>Mare Ponticum</HI> and <HI>Sinus Euxinus,</HI> the Greekes now <HI>Maurothala&s;&s;a,</HI> and the Turkes <HI>Caradenis,</HI> that is, the Blacke &s;ea. After him &s;ucceeded his &s;onne ORCHANES, who wonne the great and &s;trong city <HI>Pru&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Pru&s;a,</HI> (now called, as <HI>Bellonius</HI> writeth <HI>Bource,</HI> and was &s;ometime named <HI>Zellia</HI> and <HI>Theo|politana</HI>) which he made the head of his kingdome and place of re&s;idence for his Court. He was &s;laine in an vnfortunate battell which he fought again&s;t the Tartars, in the 22. yeare of his raigne, and left AMVRATHES his &s;onne to rule the kingdome after him: who fir&s;t, (the Grecian Princes falling at variance and calling him in) &s;ailed with an huge army out of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe:</HI> he in a &s;hort &s;pace &s;ubdued almo&s;t all <HI>Greece,</HI> and <HI>Pho|cis</HI> a part of <HI>Bulgaria,</HI> but him&s;elfe at la&s;t being ouercome and taken by <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> died and ended his daies mo&s;t di&s;honourably. The father being taken, CALEPINVS his &s;onne &s;tepped into the throne, and tooke po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the kingdome. But hauing in battell vtterly ouerthrowen <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> and his forces, and begun to wa&s;t and &s;poile the borders and territories of the Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> died in the floure of his age, when he had raigned but &s;ix yeares. <HI>Heere note by the way that,</HI> Adolphus Venerius <HI>doth not reckon this</HI> Calepine <HI>amongst the Turki&s;h Emperours. For immediately after</HI> Baiazeth, <HI>he placeth</HI> Mahomet. <HI>And that I may giue euery man his right, the &s;ingular learned man, my good friend,</HI> Georgius Bruno Agrippinen&s;is <HI>hath taught me that the very Turkes them&s;elues do not account him for an Emperour.</HI> After him MAHOMETES tooke vnto him the crown of the Em|pire, who made fierce warres vpon the Walachians: &s;ubdued a great part of <HI>Slauonia:</HI> fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed with an armie ouer the <HI>Donaw:</HI> conquered <HI>Macedonia:</HI> and pearced through the country euen as low as the Ionian &s;ea. He tran&s;lated his Court from <HI>Pru&s;ias</HI> in <HI>Bithynia,</HI> vnto <HI>Adernopoli</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> where he died in the four|teenth yeare of his raigne. After him AMVRATH the &s;econd &s;ucceeded in the kingdome. This man con|quered <HI>Epirus, Aetolia, Achaia, Boeotia, Attica</HI> and <HI>The&s;&s;alonica,</HI> (now <HI>Salonichi</HI>) a city belonging to the &s;tate of <HI>Venice.</HI> After him MAHOMET the &s;econd tooke vpon him the Diademe, he ouerthrew <HI>Athens</HI> the mo&s;t renowmed Vniuer&s;ity of the World. He wonne by battery the great city of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> vpon the nine and twentith day of <HI>May</HI> in the yeare after the birth of Chri&s;t 1452. He &s;ubdued the kingdome of <HI>Trapezon|da</HI> vnder his command. He tooke <HI>Corinth.</HI> He forced the ilands <HI>Lemnos (Stalamine</HI> they now call it) <HI>Euboea (Nigroponte)</HI> and <HI>Mitylene</HI> to yeeld to his obedience. He got <HI>Capha,</HI> a city belonging to the Signiory of <HI>Genua;</HI> and at <HI>Geiui&s;en</HI> a city of <HI>Bithynia</HI> died in the 32. yeare of his raigne. BAIAZETH the &s;econd, after his death po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the crowne. He made warre vpon the Venetians, and wanne from them <HI>Naupactus (Lepanto,</HI> or, as the Turkes call it, <HI>Einebachti) Methona, (Modon</HI> or <HI>Mutune,</HI> a city in <HI>Pelopone&s;us) Dyrrachium (Durazzo)</HI> and &s;poiled all <HI>Dalmatia.</HI> He was poi&s;oned by a Iew his Phy&s;ition. After whom SELYMVS his &s;onne &s;ucceeded in the Emperiall throne. He wanne <HI>Alcairo,</HI> the &s;tronge&s;t city of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and killing the Souldan, &s;ubdued <HI>Alexan|dria</HI> and all <HI>Aegypt</HI> vnder his obedience. He tooke al&s;o <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> in <HI>Syria.</HI> SOLYMANNVS the only &s;onne of <HI>Zelimus,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;sing his fathers roome, wanne <HI>Belgrad,</HI> tooke <HI>Buda</HI> the Princes &s;eat, and &s;poiled <HI>Strigonium</HI> and almo&s;t all <HI>Hungary.</HI> He gatte the <HI>Rhodes</HI> by compo&s;ition, and vtterly ra&s;ed <HI>Quinqueeccle&s;ias</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> (the Turkes call it <HI>Pet&s;cheu,</HI> the Dutch <HI>Funfkirchen</HI>). Hauing &s;urprized the city, he be&s;ieged <HI>Zygeth,</HI> where he ended his life. ZELIMVS the &s;econd his &s;onne, continued the battery, wanne it and &s;acked it in the yeare of Chri&s;t 1566. And thus vnder 11. Emperours, in 260. yeares, a great part of <HI>Africa,</HI> a greater of <HI>Europe</HI> and the mo&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> was by Turki&s;h tyranny, brought vnder their yoke. But he that de&s;ireth a more ab&s;olute knowledge of the hi&s;tories of the Turks, let him read <HI>Paulus Iouius, Chri&s;tofer Richer, Cu&s;pinian, Bapti&s;ta Egnatius, Gilbertus Nozorenus, Andreas Lacuna, Pius</HI> the &s;econd in the fourth chapter of his <HI>Europa,</HI> and others that haue written of the Turki&s;h affaires; but no man hath &s;et out the&s;e hi&s;tories either with greater diligence or more amply than M. <HI>Richard Knolles,</HI> our learned countryman my &s;ingular good friend. <HI>Laonicus Chalcondylas</HI> hath curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed the pedigree of the <HI>Ottomans</HI> together with the originall of the Turks. <HI>Iohn Leonclaw</HI> hath very lately imprinted the Annalles of the Souldan <HI>Otthomans,</HI> written by the Turks in their owne language, and interpreted by him into the Latine tongue. Of their ancient maner of life, behauiour and cu&s;tomes, thou mai&s;t read in the eighteen chapter of <HI>Leo</HI> the Emperour, of Warlike preparation: as al&s;o in <HI>Bartholo|mew Georgieuiz,</HI> who hath written a &s;euerall treati&s;e of that argument: but e&s;pecially the Annalles of the Tur|ki&s;h Souldans and the hi&s;tory of the Mu&s;ulmans, both written by the &s;ingular learned <HI>Iohn Leonclaw,</HI> &s;hall &s;a|tisfie thee to the full.</P>

<HEAD>The HOLY LAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_THat which the ancients called</HI> Pale&s;tina <HI>and</HI> Phoenicia, <HI>all the Europeans generally now call The</HI> HOLY LAND, <HI>vnder which name they comprehend that whole country which God gaue vnto the I&s;raelites by the name of the</HI> Land of Promi&s;e, <HI>to them and their &s;eed to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e and inhabite for euer, and which after the death of</HI> Solomon, <HI>we read, was diuided into two kingdomes,</HI> IVDAH, <HI>conteining two tribes</HI> Iudah <HI>and</HI> Beniamin, <HI>who&s;e cheife or Metropolitan city was</HI> Ieru&s;alem: <HI>and</HI> SAMARIA <HI>or</HI> ISRAEL, <HI>which comprehended the other tenne tribes, together with the city</HI> Seba&s;te <HI>or</HI> Samaria. <HI>A latter de&s;cription of the modern &s;ituation of this country, very curious &amp; exact, done by</HI> F. Brocard <HI>in a &s;euerall treati&s;e (vnto whom we &s;end the Reader for further &s;atisfaction) we offer in this Mappe: for the former tables did pre&s;ent vnto thy eie the ancient face and more beautifull countenance of this land. To him they may adioine, that plea&s;e, the treati&s;e of</HI> William Tyrius <HI>en|tituled,</HI> The Holy warres, <HI>and other authours that haue written their Peregrinations to</HI> Hieru&s;alem, <HI>of which &s;ort there is a great number written and imprinted in diuers languages. For many Chri&s;tians not only out of &s;undrie parts of</HI> Europe, <HI>but from all quarters of the world, haue in former times and now do daily trauell vnto</HI> Hieru&s;alem, <HI>for deuotion to vi&s;ite the holy &s;epulchre of our Lord and Sauiour Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, and are there &s;ometimes by the Franci&s;cane Friars, dubbed Knights, who thereof are named</HI> Knights of the Sepulchre: <HI>the order &amp; ceremonies of making the&s;e Knights, we haue thought not altogether impertinent from our purpo&s;e, to de&s;cribe in this place, as it is &s;et out by</HI> Iod. a Megge~, <HI>an ei-witnes of that, in the</HI> 12 <HI>chap. of his treati&s;e intituled,</HI> Peregrinatio Hieru&s;olymetana. <HI>And thus he hath down the maner of it:</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all therefore the Knight that is to be made, prepareth him&s;elfe vnto his deuotions, that he may receiue the fauour of the degree of the holy order, and making his confe&s;sion (hauing heard Ma&s;&s;e &amp; receiued the Sacrament) he is admitted into the roome where the holy &s;epulchre is, and then they begin on this manner: Fir&s;t, all being gathered together within the holy &s;epulchre, they &s;ing this P&s;alme, <HI>Come holy &s;pirit &amp;c.</HI> Then this, <HI>Send forth thy &s;pirit &amp;c. The An&s;wear.</HI> And renew &amp;c. Lord heare &amp;c. <HI>Let vs pray,</HI> Thou Lord, which know'&s;t the harts of the faithful &amp;c. Then the Gardian demandeth of him, what woulde&s;t thou haue? <HI>He an&s;weareth vpon his knees,</HI> I do de&s;ire to be made a knight of the order of the Holy &s;epulchre of our Lord and Sauiour Ie&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Of what &s;tate and condition of life art thou of? <HI>An&s;wear.</HI> A noble man, borne of honou|rable parents. <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Ha&s;t thou &s;ufficient liuing whereby thou mai&s;t liue and maintaine the e&s;tate and dignity of knighthood, without the help of merchandi&s;e or v&s;e of any mechanicall or handie-craft occupation? <HI>An&s;wear.</HI> I haue, thankes be to God, &s;ufficient liuing and maintenance by lands and reuenews. <HI>Que&s;tion.</HI> Art thou prepared to &s;weare with hart and mouth, to keep and ob&s;erue, to the vttermo&s;t of thy power, tho&s;e mi|litarie &s;acraments and orders which &s;halbe heereafter inioined thee, namely the&s;e which follow? Fir&s;t, a knight of the holy order of the &s;epulchre mu&s;t euery day, if opportunity be offered, heare a ma&s;&s;e or diuine &s;eruice. Secondly, when need requireth, viz. when there is any generall warre again&s;t the Pagans or Infidels, he mu&s;t aduenture both body and goods in the quarrell of the Church; that is, he is bound either to go in his owne per&s;on, or to &s;end thither of his charges, &s;ome one &s;ufficient man or other. Thirdly, he is bound by that oath to defend and free, in as much as in him &s;hall lie, the holy Church of God, and all the members of the &s;ame, from their per&s;ecutors, and from the enemies of Chri&s;tianity. Fourthly, he mu&s;t altogether &s;hunne vniu&s;t warres, filthy lucre and hire, fencing, iu&s;ts, torneaments, combats and &s;uch like, but only for exerci&s;e and making of him&s;elfe more fit for the &s;acred warre. Fifthly, he mu&s;t procure peace and concord between faithfull Chri&s;tian people, do his be&s;t to grace and enlarge the bounds of his country, defend orphanes and widdowes, he mu&s;t carefully take heed of cur&s;ed oathes, periuries, bla&s;phemies, rapes, v|&s;urie, &s;acriledge, murther, drunkenne&s;&s;e, &s;u&s;pected places, infamous per&s;ons, and to &s;hunne and keep him&s;elfe, (as from the deadly plague) from all tho&s;e vices of the fle&s;h that mortall man by nature is &s;o much &s;ubiect vnto: and that he do &s;o cary him&s;elfe, that in the iudgement of men he &s;hall not be blame worthy, but &s;hall &s;hew him&s;elfe worthy of that honour that he is called vnto, by frequenting the Church &amp; procuring the honour and glory of God in what he can. <HI>It is therefore demanded of him,</HI> whether he be ready with hart &amp; voice to prote&s;t, &s;weare &amp; performe all the&s;e things? <HI>An&s;wear.</HI> IN. do prote&s;t and promi&s;e before our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> his mother, that I will, to the vttermo&s;t of my power, ob&s;erue all the&s;e things. The&s;e being done, the Sword is ble&s;&s;ed or con&s;ecrated by the Gardian, according to the ble&s;sing beneath pre|&s;cribed, if it be not otherwi&s;e con&s;ecrated before: but if it be ble&s;&s;ed, then after that ble&s;sing or con&s;ecration, calling one of tho&s;e that are to be made Knights, and cau&s;ing him to kneell downe before the holy &s;epulchre, the Gardian putteth his hand vpon his head and &s;aith: Thou N. be thou a faithfull, true, &s;tout, good and braue &s;ouldiour of our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, and of his holy &s;epulchre, whom we pray to vouch&s;afe thee his heauenly glory with his cho&s;en Saints, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then the father Gardian giueth him a paire of gilded &s;purres, which he mu&s;t put vpon his heeles, &s;tanding vpon the ground. Afterward he giueth the naked &s;word to the Knight: &s;aying, Take thou N. the holy Sword, In the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Amen.</HI> (making withall 3 cro&s;&s;es vpon the &s;ame) V&s;e it for thine owne defence, &amp; for the defence of the holy Church of God, to the offence and confu&s;ion of the enemies of the cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t and Chri&s;tian faith, and to thy vttermo&s;t power thou &s;halt hurt no man wrongfully with it: which he vouch&s;afe to grant, who with the Father and the holy Gho&s;t raigneth one God both now and for euer, <HI>Amen.</HI> Then the Sword is put vp into the &s;cabberd, &amp; the Gardian girdeth the Sword about the Knight &s;aying, Be thou N. mo&s;t valiant, girded with thy Sword vpon thy thigh, in the name of our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t: and ob&s;erue, that the Saints haue conquered kingdomes not by their &s;wordes, but by faith. The Knight thus girded with the Sword ari&s;eth, and re&s;ting vpon his knees and leaning his head vpon the holy Sepulchre, he is dub'd by the Gar|dian, 3 times &s;miting the Sword vpon the &s;houlders of the Knight, and &s;aying thri&s;e the&s;e words, I ordain &amp; make thee N. a Knight of the holy Se|pulchre, of our Lord Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, in the name of the Father and of the Sonne and of the holy Gho&s;t, <HI>Amen.</HI> (making as afore 3. cro&s;&s;es.) Then he ki&s;&s;eth him, and putteth vpon his necke, according to the old maner, a chaine of Gold with a cro&s;&s;e hanging vpon it; La&s;tly, the Knight ki&s;sing the Sepulcher, re&s;toreth all the&s;e ornaments, goeth a&s;ide, and another is called, which is to be dubbed with the like ceremonies: In the meane time the Knight fir&s;t made mu&s;t &s;tay in the hall of the holy Sepulchre, vntill &s;uch time as all the re&s;t that are to be preferred to this dignity, haue obtained the &s;ame. When they are all made, then <HI>Te Deum</HI> is &s;ong by the Friars, and from thence they go to the chappell of the Minorites, or el&s;e there they &s;tay &s;till, as the Gardian &s;hall plea&s;e or appoint. Then the&s;e words following are &s;poken in the &s;ingular number, if there be but one: if there be many, in the plurall. In the &s;ingular it is &s;aid, Thou more beautifull than the &s;onnes of men, thou N. gird &amp;c. with thy &s;word vpon thy thigh, o thou mo&s;t mighty. If there be many it is &s;poken in the plurall number. <HI>The Ver&s;icle.</HI> Lord heare &amp;c. <HI>An&s;wear.</HI> And let my crie come vnto thee. The Lord be with you. And with thy &s;pirit. <HI>Let vs pray.</HI> Grant vnto thy Church, mo&s;t mercifull God, that being gathered together in the Holy Gho&s;t, it may no manner of way be di&s;turbed by the a&s;&s;ault of the enimy. Almighty and euerla&s;ting God, powre the grace of thy ble&s;|&s;ing vpon this thy &s;eruant (or the&s;e thy &s;eruants) which at this in&s;tant de&s;ireth to be girded with the glorious &s;word, cau&s;e him, being defended by the power of thy right hand, to be continually garded with a garri&s;on of heauenly &s;ouldiers again&s;t all aduer&s;aries, whereby he may not be mole|&s;ted in this world with any tempe&s;tuous &s;tormes of bitter wars, by Chri&s;t our Lord, &amp;c. La&s;tly, the Gardian and others, if they plea&s;e, do embrace him. <HI>The ble&s;&s;ing of the &s;word.</HI> Hee that ble&s;&s;eth it mu&s;t hold the &s;word naked before him and &s;ay, Our help is in the name of the Lord &amp;c. <HI>Let vs pray.</HI> Li&s;ten, we pray thee o Lord, vnto our praiers, and vouch&s;afe with the right hand of thy Maie&s;ty to ble&s;&s;e this &s;word, wherewith this thy &s;er|uant de&s;ireth to be armed, to the end that he may be a defendour of the Church, of widdowes, orphanes, and of all &s;uch as &s;erue God, again&s;t the fury of the Paganes and Infidels; and a terrour and dread to &s;uch as &s;hall a&s;&s;ault or go about to hurt him, a&s;&s;uring him of the certain effect of iu&s;t &amp; lawfull defence and offence, by Chri&s;t our Lord, <HI>Amen. Let vs pray.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed Lord, holy Father almighty, and eternall God, by the inuocation of thy ble&s;&s;ed name, by the comming of thy &s;onne Ie&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, and by the gift of the holy Gho&s;t, ble&s;&s;e this &s;word, that this thy &s;er|uant, which this &s;ame day, by thy bounteous fauour, is to be girded vnto him, may ouerthrow and beat downe all thy enemies both vi&s;ible and inui&s;ible, and he getting the vpper hand may continually abide void of all danger, by Chri&s;t our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI> The ble&s;&s;ed Lord, my rocke, which teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to warre: my large&s;&s;e and my ca&s;tle, my high tower, and my deliuerer, my protectour in whom I haue put my tru&s;t, is he that &s;ubdueth my people that is vnder me. Glory be to the Father and to the Sonne &amp;c. Saue thy &s;eruant o Lord God, which putteth his tru&s;t in thee. Be thou, o Lord, vnto him a tower of &s;trength: from the face of his enemie. Lord heare our praier. The Lord be with you &amp;c. <HI>Let vs pray.</HI> O holy Lord, father almighty, who only do&s;t gouerne and rightly di&s;po&s;e&s;t all things, who ha&s;t by thy gratious prouidence granted to man, in this world, the v&s;e of the &s;word to repre&s;&s;e the malice and audacious lewdne&s;&s;e of the wicked, and to maintaine right and e|quity; and woulde&s;t that the order of knighthood &s;hould be in&s;tituted for the &s;afegard and protection of thy people, who al&s;o cau&s;e&s;t it to be pro|claimed by Saint <HI>Iohn Bapti&s;t,</HI> to the &s;oulders which came vnto him into the wilderne&s;&s;e, that they &s;hould &s;mite no man, but be content with their owne wages: we do humbly be&s;eech thy gratious goodne&s;&s;e, that as thou gaue&s;t to thy &s;eruant <HI>Dauid</HI> power to ouercome <HI>Goliath,</HI> and made&s;t <HI>Iu|das Marcabeus</HI> to triumph ouer tho&s;e fierce nations which called not vpon thy name: &s;o al&s;o to this thy &s;eruant N. who lately hath &s;ubmitted his necke to the yoke of knighthood, grant for thy mercies &s;ake power &amp; &s;trength to defend faith and iu&s;tice, giue vnto him the encrea&s;e of faith, hope, and charity, and in him order all things aright that pertaine to thy feare and loue of thy holy name, to true humility, per&s;euerance, obedience, and patience, that he may hurt no man wrongfully with this &s;word or any other, &amp; that he may with it defend all things that are iu&s;t and right: and like as he now is promoted from a low and mean degree, vnto this new and honourable e&s;tate of knighthood, &s;o he putting off the old man with all his affections, may put on the new man, that he may feare and reuerence thee aright, as he ought to do, may &s;hunne the company of the wicked mi|&s;creant Infidels and may extend his charity vnto his neighbour, be truely obedient in all things to him to whom he is &s;ubiect, and do his duty vp|rightly in all things that he &s;hall be emploied in, by Chri&s;t our Lord, <HI>Amen.</HI> The forme of the oth which they mu&s;t take before they may be admit|ted to take this holy order of knighthood vpon them, thou mai&s;t &s;ee in the Orientall iournall written by <HI>Leonard Rauwolph,</HI> in the Dutch tongue.</P>

That <HI>Nilus,</HI> the riuer which runneth through the midde&s;t of it and watereth all the country, doth empty it &s;elfe into the Midland &s;ea only by foure mouthes, again&s;t the opinion of all ancient wri|ters, <HI>Gulielmus Tyrius</HI> doth teach vs, who is a man worthy to be beleeued in this ca&s;e: for he was both an eie-witne&s;&s;e, and a mo&s;t diligent &s;earcher out of the truth of the &s;ame. I haue a Mappe, which I thinke was made by the pen in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which mentions &s;o many, neither doth it point out more that are worth the &s;peaking of. <HI>Haithon</HI> writeth that in this whole country there is be&s;ide <HI>Ale|xandria</HI> and <HI>Cairo,</HI> neuer a &s;trong city or any that is fortified with ditch, wall or rampart. Yet it is apparant out of the de&s;cription of this prouince done by <HI>Iohn Leo Africanus,</HI> that there be diuers other cities be&s;ide the&s;e, although they be not very &s;trong. For in his eighth booke of the de&s;cription of <HI>Africke,</HI> he reckoneth vp thirty and two, be&s;ide certaine other villages, which he de&s;cri|beth according to their name and &s;ituation.

<P>_THe &s;ame whom we in <HI>Europe</HI> call <HI>Pre&s;byter Iohn,</HI> or <HI>Prie&s;t Iohn,</HI> the Moores call ATICI ABASSI. them&s;elus, that is, the Aby&s;sines or Ethiopians, ACEGVE and NEGVZ, that is, Emperour and King, for his proper name is arbitrarily giuen him (as heere we v&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI>) at the di&s;cretion of the parents. It &s;eemeth al&s;o that at his coronation he chan|geth his name, (like as the Popes of <HI>Rome</HI> v&s;e at this day to do) and together with his crowne to take vnto him ano|ther proper appellation: for he which in our remembrance po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the throne and made a league of amity with the King of <HI>Portugall,</HI> was called before his coronation <HI>Atani Tingal,</HI> but after he had taken vpon him the Emperiall diademe he was named <HI>Dauid.</HI> This <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn,</HI> out of doubt, in this our age, is one of the greate&s;t Monarches of the World, who&s;e kingdome lying between the two Tropickes, reacheth from the Red-&s;ea almo&s;t vnto the Ethi|opian ocean: and that we may &s;omewhat more preci&s;ely &s;et downe the bounds of this Empire, (for as much as we can gather out of the &s;urueihgs of the &s;ame, made and &s;et forth by &s;ome learned men of our time) it hath vpon the North <HI>Egypt,</HI> (which now is vnder the command of the Turke) on the ea&s;t it abutteth vpon the Red &s;ea and <HI>Bar|baricum &s;inum (Pliny</HI> calleth it <HI>Troglodyticum &s;inum;</HI> others <HI>A&s;perum mare,</HI> the rough &s;ea; the &s;eamen at this day vulgarly, <HI>Golfo de Melinde:</HI> on the South it is &s;trongly by nature fen&s;ed and enclo&s;ed by <HI>Montes Lunae,</HI> the mountaines of the Moone: on the We&s;t it is confined by the kingdome of <HI>Nubia</HI> and the riuer <HI>Nilus.</HI> The&s;e bounds do &s;eeme to containe that prouince which old writers called <HI>Ethiopia</HI> beneath <HI>Egypt,</HI> together with <HI>Troglodytis,</HI> &amp; <HI>Cinnamomifera regio,</HI> (the country where in tho&s;e daies Cinnamon grew mo&s;t plentifull, with part of the inner <HI>Libya.</HI> The&s;e countries now are diuided into many &s;maller prouinces, and are called by diuers and &s;undrie names, as thou mai&s;t &s;ee in the Mappe. The&s;e countrie people are at this day generally of all our moderne Hi&s;toriographers called ABYSSINI, or, as them&s;elues with the Arabians round about them, pro|nounce the word <HI>Hhabas,</HI> and with <HI>Al,</HI> the Arabicke article or pronoune, prefixed, <HI>Alhabas,</HI> as <HI>Beniamin</HI> reporteth; and <HI>Abexim,</HI> as <HI>Garcias ab Horto</HI> affirmeth: all which wordes indeed originally are the &s;ame, and do only differ either in &s;ound or maner of writing: for the Ea&s;tern <HI>Hheth,</HI> (a letter I meane proper to tho&s;e nations, and barbarous to vs borne in <HI>Europe,</HI> the We&s;t part of the World) is diuer&s;lly expre&s;&s;ed by diuers, (as they do well know which know ought in the Hebrew, Arabicke, Syrian, and Ethiopicke languages) &s;ometimes by our &s;ingle <HI>h,</HI> &s;ometime by the double <HI>hh,</HI> otherwi&s;e by <HI>ch,</HI> others do wholly omit it, as not finding any letter, in that language in which they write, that is of that nature and pow|er, whereby they may truly expre&s;&s;e the &s;ame. Again the la&s;t letter of the &s;ame word which the Hebrewes and Arabians call <HI>Schin,</HI> is &s;ometime ex|pre&s;&s;ed by <HI>&s;h,</HI> &s;ometime by <HI>&s;&s;,</HI> or by the Spani&s;h <HI>x,</HI> (which they &s;ound almo&s;t like our <HI>&s;h</HI>) and &s;ometimes by <HI>s</HI> or <HI>z.</HI> For thus I find the word writ|ten often in the holy Scriptures tran&s;lated into Arabicke and <HI>Haba&s;hi</HI> and <HI>Alhaba&s;&s;i, P&s;alm.</HI> 68.32. and 74.14. <HI>Item</HI> in <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.13. where <HI>Ardzi' lhabas,</HI> the land of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> is the &s;ame that <HI>Auicenna</HI> in the 283. chapter of the &s;econd tract of his &s;econd booke, calleth <HI>B'ledi'lhhaba&s;hah,</HI> the country of the Aby&s;sines, or as our fathers named it, <HI>India Occidentalis,</HI> the We&s;t <HI>Indies;</HI> the interpetour <HI>Gerardus Cremonen&s;is</HI> hath <HI>Terras al|habes, Bellunen&s;is</HI> hath <HI>Terras Indiae minoris,</HI> the countries of the Aby&s;sines, or of the le&s;&s;er <HI>India.</HI> Heere al&s;o it is worth the ob&s;eruing that this word, out of all doubt, had his originall from the Hebrew &shin;&vav;&kaf; <HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> whereby they did long &s;ince call this nation and people, as it is apparant out of <HI>Gen.</HI> 10.5. and 2.13. by the iudgement of all Interpreters, Grammarians and Iewi&s;h Rabbines. For the Hebrew &vav;, or <HI>vaw,</HI> which indeed, and in his owne nature is the &s;ame with our <HI>w,</HI> is pronounced of &s;ome nations in &s;ome ca&s;es like the Germane <HI>v,</HI> or <HI>v</HI> con&s;onant, as they call it, &s;omewhat like the &s;ound of <HI>b,</HI> altogether the &s;ame with that pronunciation of the Hebrew <HI>Beth,</HI> when it followeth a vowell, as the modern Grammarians and Iewi&s;h Rabbines do now teach. According to which cu&s;tome it is not vnlikely but that this word &shin;&vav;&kaf;, which the Iewes &s;ounded <HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> &s;ome other nations might pronounce and vowell thus, &shin;&vav;&het; <HI>chaua&s;h, chabaas, habas,</HI> or <HI>Aby&s;&s;i.</HI> And indeed, the A&s;ians generally, and they them&s;elues, as <HI>Ortelius</HI> citeth out of <HI>Io&s;ephus,</HI> do call them&s;elues <HI>Chu&s;aeos,</HI> and, as he reporteth from the relation of the reuerend <HI>B. Arias Montanus Hi&s;palen&s;is,</HI> they are euen to this day of the Portugals &s;till called <HI>Cu&s;sij</HI> of <HI>Cu&s;h,</HI> I make no que&s;tion. The people are blacke, or of a deep tawny or blacki&s;h co|lour: and blacke, we &s;ay in our common prouerbe, will take none other hue. Whereupon the Prophet <HI>Ieremy</HI> in the 23. ver&s;e of the 13. chapter of his prophecy &s;aith thus: Can &yod;&shin;&vav;&kaf; <HI>Cu&s;hi,</HI> (the Aby&s;sine or Blacka-moore) change his skinne? or the leopard his &s;pots? For the &s;ame rea&s;on al&s;o the learned Diuines do iudge that <HI>Dauid</HI> in the title or &s;uper&s;cription of the &s;euenth P&s;alme, by <HI>Cu&s;h</HI> did meane <HI>Saul,</HI> for that his deadly hate was &s;uch toward him, that by no good meanes that he might v&s;e, he could make him change his mind, more than an Indian doth his skinne, as <HI>Kimchi</HI> the great Rabbine doth interpret this place. The people are by profe&s;sion Chri&s;tians, as appeareth by the letters of the &s;aid <HI>Dauid,</HI> written vnto Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the &s;euenth. Of who&s;e manner of life, cu&s;tomes and religion, we haue gathered the&s;e few lines, out of the trauels of <HI>Francis Aluares,</HI> written and imprinted in the Italian tongue.</P>
<P>In the&s;e countries there are very many Mona&s;teries and Religious hou&s;es, both of men and women: Into the Mona&s;teries of the men, there is neither woman, nor any liuing creature of the female &s;ex, that may enter or once looke within the gates. Their Monkes, which heere do hold their Lent for fifty daies together, do fa&s;t for the mo&s;t part only with bread and water. For in the&s;e countries there is &s;mall &s;tore of fi&s;h, e&s;pecially in the vpland places: for although the riuers are well &s;tored of fi&s;h, yet they giue not their mind to fi&s;hing, becau&s;e they know not how to catch them; there is none skilled in that art. In time of Lent, certaine of the&s;e Monkes do not eat any bread at all, only they liue vpon rootes and herbs: &s;ome of them for all that time do neuer go to bed, nor &s;leepe but as they &s;it in the water vp to the chinne. In their Churches they haue bels as we haue, but for the mo&s;t part made of &s;tone. Their Mini&s;ters and Prie&s;ts are married. They &s;ay Ma&s;&s;e, and do go in proce&s;sion with cro&s;&s;es and cen&s;ers like as they v&s;e in &s;ome Churches in <HI>Europe.</HI> The Friars do weare their haire long, but their Prie&s;ts do not &s;o: neither of them weare any &s;hoes, nor any man, neither Churchman nor Layman, may once enter within the Church dores, with &s;hoes on his feet. They keep Sundaies and Holy-daies, vpon which they do no manner of worke. They are all circumci&s;ed, both men and women: but they are al&s;o bapti&s;ed in the name of the Father and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Gho&s;t, yet not vntill the fortith day after their birth: they which liue not till this day, are buried vnchri&s;tened: to all tho&s;e that are baptized the holy communion or Euchari&s;t, as they call it, is at the &s;ame in&s;tant admini&s;tred, powring a great deale of water into the childes mouth, that he may &s;o much the more ea&s;ily get it downe. The proper names which then are giuen them, are all of &s;ome &s;ignification. They affirme that they were conuerted vnto Chri&s;tian religion by <HI>Candaces,</HI> (a Queen of this country, &s;poken of in the 27. ver&s;e of the 8. chapter of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles) who&s;e proper name they thinke was <HI>Iudith.</HI> They haue a booke diuided into 8. parts, (this they call <HI>Manda</HI> and <HI>Abetilis</HI>) which they do verily beleeue was written by all the Apo&s;tles being iointly for that purpo&s;e gathered together at <HI>Hieru&s;alem:</HI> all the contents of this booke they do mo&s;t diligently and &s;trictly ob&s;erue. The ba&s;er &s;ort of people do without any controwlement or feare of pu|ni&s;hment marry 2. or 3. wiues, according to their ability and as they can tell how to maintaine them: but the&s;e are excommunicated, and forbid|den by the Cleargy to enter into the Church. Their lawes do tolerate diuorcements. The Noble-men do e&s;teem raw beefe, &s;erued in with fre&s;h or hot bloud, in manner as we v&s;e our boiled meats with pottage or &s;tewed broth, for a great and dainty di&s;h.</P>
<P>In all the kingdome of <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn</HI> they haue no manner of bra&s;en or copper money, but in &s;teed of it they v&s;e pure gold vncoined of a certaine weight. In like manner &s;alt, (yet not only in the&s;e prouinces, but al&s;o generall throughout all <HI>Africa</HI>) is v&s;ed in exchange and buying and &s;elling in &s;tead of money. In &s;ome places &s;mall pieces of iron bright and burni&s;hed do &s;erue that turne. But pepper among&s;t the&s;e people is of &s;uch great price, that what&s;oeuer a man will buy, he may ea&s;ily obtaine it for that merchandice. The&s;e countries haue almo&s;t all &s;orts of bea&s;ts and fowles; as Elephants, Lions, Tygres, Lo&s;&s;es, (<HI>Lynces</HI> the Latines call them) Badgers, Apes and Stagges, (contrary to the opinion of the old writers, which haue generally denied that <HI>Africa</HI> doth veeld this kind of bea&s;t) but in all that &s;ix yeare which <HI>Aluares</HI> this our authour, dwelt in the&s;e countries, he writeth that he neuer &s;aw any Beares, Conies, Linnets, Magpies, or Cuccoes. Yet <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> an African borne, in his 9. booke &s;aith, that in <HI>Barbary</HI> there is wonderfull &s;tore of Conies.</P>
<P>The Locu&s;ts do more vex and hurt this country, than any place of the World be&s;ide, &s;o that this plague is almo&s;t proper and peculiar to them. Such oftentimes is the number and abundance of them, that as they flie they do &s;eeme to darken the aire and &s;hadow the earth: they flie together in &s;uch great flockes and thicke troupes that they do vtterly &s;poile and con&s;ume the fruits &s;ometime of one prouince &s;ometime of another; wholly almo&s;t deuouring all their corn vpon the ground, eating vp the leaues and barkes of the trees, leauing their meddowes and pa&s;tures bare of gra&s;&s;e, &s;o that the people do oftentimes leaue their natiue &s;oile where they were bred and borne, and are forced, for want of victuals, to go &s;eeke &s;ome other place to dwell in.</P>
<P>There is in the&s;e quarters a city named <HI>Ca&s;&s;umo,</HI> &s;ometime the &s;eat (as their hi&s;tories do record) and place of the Queen of <HI>Saba, Maquedam,</HI> (that is, as I thinke, <HI>Anti&s;tes,</HI> a Prouo&s;t or Pre&s;ident) they &s;ay &s;he was called. By whom they affirme that <HI>Salomon</HI> King of <HI>I&s;ra l,</HI> had a &s;onne named <HI>Meilech,</HI> (that is, <HI>The King.</HI>) In this city they are per&s;waded that the Queen <HI>Cand ces</HI> did afterward dwell. But it is be&s;t that the Reader that is de|&s;irous of further &s;atisfaction, to haue recour&s;e to the &s;ame <HI>Francis Aluares,</HI> who hath very curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed tho&s;e thing which he did mo&s;t dili|gently ob&s;erue in that his Amba&s;&s;age into the&s;e countries. <HI>Item Iohn Bermundes,</HI> who &s;et foorth his Amba&s;&s;age vnto the Aby&s;sines, in the Portugall language. Let him al&s;o read a little treati&s;e of <HI>Damianus &agrave; Goes,</HI> which he wrot out of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and <HI>Sabellicus</HI> his 10. <HI>Enneas</HI> of his 8. booke.

<HEAD>BARBARY, and BILEDVLGERID.</HEAD>
<P>_THe later writers, which haue diuided <HI>Africa</HI> into foure parts, do name this <HI>Barbary</HI> for the chiefe: and they do thus bound it; On the Ea&s;t toward the ri&s;ing of the &s;un it hath the de&s;erts of <HI>Marmarica</HI> (at this day they call it <HI>Barcha</HI>) euen as farre as that part of the mount <HI>Atlas,</HI> which now is vulgarly called <HI>Meies,</HI> which part peraduen|ture was de&s;cribed by <HI>Strabo</HI> vnder the name <HI>Aspis.</HI> This mountaine (which runneth all along by the &s;ide of it from the Ea&s;t vnto the We&s;t, euen to the maine &s;ea which of it is called <HI>Mare Atlanticum,</HI> the Atlanticke &s;ea) doth bound it vpon the South. On the We&s;t it abutteth vpon the &s;aid Atlanticke &s;ea. On the North coa&s;t the Me|diterran &s;ea doth beat: therefore all that whole tract of <HI>Africa</HI> which formerly conteined both the <HI>Maurita|nies, Africa,</HI> properly &s;o called, and <HI>Cyrene,</HI> is generally by one name called BARBARIA; all which tract, as <HI>Suidas</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, was vnder the command of King <HI>Ma&s;mi&s;&s;a.</HI></P>
<P>This now is held for the be&s;t and mo&s;t famous part of all <HI>Africa,</HI> and is diuided into foure kingdomes, or, if you like that terme better, foure prouinces: namely, <HI>Marroccho, Fe&s;&s;e, Tele&s;ine,</HI> and <HI>Tunete.</HI> The people generally of this whole country are of a browni&s;h or tawny complexion. They which dwell in cities, are very ingenious in Architecture and &s;uch like Mathematicall inuentions: which a man may ea&s;ily gather by their rare and artificiall workman&s;hip &s;hewed in their buildings. They are (if we may beleeue <HI>Iohn Leo Africanus</HI>) mo&s;t &s;ingular hone&s;t men: without any deceit or couen: not only making a &s;hew of &s;implicity and true dealing outwardly and in word, but al&s;o approouing the &s;ame by their actions to be &s;o indeed and in hart. They are very &s;tout and &s;trong men; but e&s;pecially tho&s;e which dwell in the hils and moun|taines. There is no Nation vnder Heauen that is more zealous, &s;o that they had rather die, than to put vp any wrong or di&s;grace offered by their wiues. They are very couetous of wealth and as ambitiou&s;ly giuen to &s;eeke after honour and preferment, and therefore they trade and traffique almo&s;t into all quarters of the World. They which dwell in tents, that is, &s;uch as follow gra&s;ing and do liue by cattell, are very kind men, courageous, patient, curtuous, good hou&s;ekeepers, and as great louers of vprightne&s;&s;e, as any men in the whole world el&s;ewhere. But &s;eeing the &s;tate of the world is &s;uch, that there is no man altogether ble&s;&s;ed, none but haue their faults, the&s;e al&s;o are not without their vices: for the citizens, which before we &s;pake of, are exceeding haughty and proud, ha&s;ty and fumi&s;h, &s;o that the lea&s;t iniury or indignity that may be offered, they do, as the common &s;aying is, engraue in marble, they will neuer forget it. The coun|try or vplandi&s;h people are &s;o clowni&s;h and of &s;uch rude behauiour, and that &s;o deepely imprinted in their mindes, that they will hardly be wonne to acquaint them&s;elues with any &s;tranger, he &s;hall hardly e|uer winne their fauour. They are &s;o plaine and &s;imply minded, that they are ea&s;ily drawne to beleeue things told them, although almo&s;t incredible. Of naturall Philo&s;ophy they are &s;o ignorant, that they hold all things done by the naturall force and operations of Nature, to be wholy &s;upernaturall. They are &s;o ha&s;ty and cholericke that one &s;hall hardly in the day time walke the &s;treets but he &s;hall &s;ee two or three either quarrelling or together by the eares. They neuer &s;peake but ha&s;tily, aloud and as if they would eat one another. Thus farre of the quality and behauiour of the people, now it remaineth that we &s;hould &s;peake &s;omewhat of the nature of the &s;oile and country.</P>
<P>That part of the country which is toward the Mediterran &s;ea, is full of hils and mountaines. From the&s;e mountaines euen vnto famous <HI>Atlas,</HI> it is plaine and champion, yet heere and there ri&s;ing with knols and hils. Heere are very many goodly &s;pringes, and therefore it is well watered with diuers plea&s;ant brookes and riuers. It yeeldeth great &s;tore of Dates and Pomegranates: it is not very fertile for corne and graine: but of figges, and oliues with &s;uch like fruites it affoordeth yearely great plenty. Mount ATLAS, verie cold and barren, on all &s;ides full of woods, and couered ouer with &s;now, breedeth almo&s;t all the riuers of <HI>Africke.</HI> Yet the cold heere is neuer &s;o great and &s;harp that one need to de&s;ire to come to the fire to warme him. The later end of Autumne, all the Winter and a great part of the Spring haue many boi&s;terous and bitter &s;tormes of wind and haile: and oftentimes they are in the&s;e places much vexed and affrighted with terrible thundrings and lightning: in &s;ome places they haue great and deep &s;nowes, &amp;c. But <HI>Iohannes Leo Africanus</HI> hath de&s;cribed the&s;e countries and people very curiou&s;ly and at large, who will &s;atisfie thee at the full; to whom it thou plea&s;e&s;t thou maie&s;t adioine what <HI>Ludouicus Marmolius,</HI> and <HI>Fazellus</HI> in the fir&s;t chapter of the &s;ixth booke of the latter decade of his hi&s;tory of <HI>Sicily,</HI> haue written of this prouince. <HI>Caelius Augu&s;tinus Curio</HI> hath &s;et out the de&s;cription of the kingdome of <HI>Marocho</HI> in a &s;euerall treati&s;e, to him, he that plea&s;eth, may adioine <HI>Diego de Turribus,</HI> who in the Spani&s;h tongue hath written a booke of the Originall and Succe&s;sion of the <HI>Xariffes.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The kingdomes of FESSE and MAROCCHO.</HEAD>
<P>_THat part of <HI>Africa,</HI> which of old was called MAVRITANIA TINGITANA, at this day comprehendeth the kingdomes of <HI>Fe&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Maroccho,</HI> which heere we pre&s;ent vnto thy view in this Mappe. Of the which MA|ROCCHO, taketh the name of <HI>Maroccho</HI> (they call it <HI>Marox,</HI> the Spaniards <HI>Marwechos</HI>) the chiefe and metro|politane citie of the &s;ame. The territories round about this city, and generally the &s;oile and fields of the whole kingdome, as <HI>Iohn Leo Africanus</HI> writeth, are mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile, euery where be&s;pread with heards of cattell, flockes of &s;heep and diuers &s;orts of deere and wild bea&s;ts: in all places are green and goodly pa&s;tures, mo&s;t plentifully yeelding what&s;oeuer is nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of mans life, what&s;oeuer may recreate the &s;en&s;es by plea&s;ant &s;mels, or plea&s;e the eies with delight&s;ome &s;hewes. The whole kingdome is almo&s;t no|thing el&s;e but one large champion, not much vnlike <HI>Lombardy,</HI> the Paradi&s;e of <HI>Italy.</HI> The hils that are (which are but very few) are exceeding bleake, cold, and barren, &s;o that they will beare nothing but barly. <HI>Maroccho</HI> which we &s;aid was the chiefe city of this kingdome, is accounted one of the greate&s;t cities of the whole world: for it is of &s;uch a won|derfull bigne&s;&s;e, that in the raigne of <HI>Haly</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Io&s;eph</HI> their king, it had more than an hundred thou&s;and families. It hath about it 24. gates. The wall of a maruelous thickne&s;&s;e, is made of a kind of white &s;tone and chalke vnburned. There are heere &s;uch abundance of Churches, Colledges, &s;toues or hothou&s;es and innes, as iu&s;tly more may not be de&s;ired. Among&s;t the Churches, there is none more artificially and gorgeou&s;ly built, than that which &s;tandeth in the midde&s;t of the city built by the fore&s;aid <HI>Haly.</HI> There is another be&s;ide this fir&s;t, rai&s;ed by <HI>Abdu'-lmumen,</HI> his &s;ucce&s;&s;our, and enlarged by <HI>Man&s;or,</HI> his nephew: and la&s;tly more richly &s;et out with many good|ly columnes, which he cau&s;ed to be brought out of <HI>Spaine.</HI> He made a fountaine or ce&s;tern vnderneath the Church, as large and wide as the whole Church it &s;elfe. The roofe of the Church he couered all ouer with lead. At euery corner he made &s;poutes, by which the raine water falling vpon the roofe might runne into the ce&s;tern vnderneath. The &s;teeple made of a very hard kind of &s;tone, like that of the Amphitheater of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> is higher than that towre of <HI>Bononia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI> The gree&s;es or &s;taiers, by which they go vp to the toppe of it, are euery one nine handfull thicke, but in the out&s;ide of the wall are tenne. This tower hath &s;euen roomes or lofts one a|boue another. Vpon the toppe of it is &s;et another turret or &s;pire like a pyramis, &s;harpe toward the top. This hath three lofts one aboue another, into which they go vp from one to another by &s;taires or ladders made of wood. On the toppe of this &s;pire vpon a &s;haft of iron, in &s;teed of a weather-cocke, doth &s;tand a mo&s;t goodly Moone of pure gold, with three golden globes &s;o put vpon the iron &s;haft, that the greate&s;t is lowe&s;t, the lea&s;t highe&s;t of all. If any man from the toppe of the &s;teeple &s;hall looke downe toward the ground, the talle&s;t man that is &s;eemeth no bigger, than a child of a yeare old. From the toppe al&s;o of this the cape or fore-land which they call <HI>Azaphy,</HI> being an hundred and thirty miles off, may ea&s;ily be de&s;cried. And although one &s;hould skarcely find a greater Church if one &s;hould trauell all the world ouer, yet the place is almo&s;t wholly de&s;ert: for none do euer v&s;e to come hither but vpon Fridaies. Vnder the cloi&s;ters of this Church they report that there were wont to be an hundred Stationers, and as many ouer again&s;t them on the other &s;ide of the Churchyard, which daily heere kept &s;hoppe, where as now I do not thinke that all this whole city can affoord at this time one booke-&s;eller. Hardly the one third part of the towne is inhabited. Heere hence it is that within the wals there are many vineyeards, large gardens of palme-trees and other fruites, with goodly corne fields mo&s;t fertile and well manured: for without the wals they can|not till the ground by rea&s;on of the frequent inrodes of the theeui&s;h Arabians. This one thing is mo&s;t certaine, that this city is &s;uddenly growne old before the time: for it is not aboue fiue hundred and &s;ix yeares, &s;ince it was fir&s;t built. There is al&s;o in this city a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, which in re&s;pect of the large bigne&s;&s;e, the great thickene&s;&s;e and compa&s;&s;e of the wals, the high and many towers, or la&s;tly, the goodly and &s;tately gates built of the riche&s;t Tiburtine marble, may iu&s;tly be accounted for a faire towne. Within this ca&s;tle is a mo&s;t beautifull Church with a very high &s;teeple, vpon who&s;e toppe is a golden moone, with three golden globes of different bigne&s;&s;es, all of them weighing 130. crownes. There haue been &s;ome kings of this country, who, moued with the loue and valew of the gold, haue attempted to take the&s;e globes downe and to put them into their pur&s;es, but alwaies &s;ome &s;trange euent or misfortune or other did hin|der their purpo&s;e and cro&s;&s;e their de&s;ires. So that it is now commonly among&s;t the people held for a very ominous thing for any man but once to offer to touch the&s;e globes with his hand. Let this be &s;ufficient to haue &s;poken of this city in this place: he that de&s;ireth a larger di&s;cour&s;e both of the city and ca&s;tle, let him haue recour&s;e vnto <HI>Leo Africanus,</HI> who in his 2. booke will &s;atisfie him to the full. In this kingdome al&s;o is the city TARADANT, (the Moores call it <HI>Taurent</HI>) a very great and goodly city built by the ancient Africanes. It conteineth about 3000. hou&s;es or families. The people are more ciuill and curtuous than in other places heere about. Heere are many artificers of diuers and &s;undry occupations. The towne&s;men do yearely rai&s;e a great profit by keeping of a gard to defend merchants, that from hence do trauell vp higher into the country, from the a&s;&s;ault of theeues and robbers, and to conduct and lead them the neere|e&s;t and be&s;t way: for it is a place of great re&s;ort of &s;trangers a&s;well of Chri&s;tians as others. There are al&s;o other cities, as the mappe doth &s;hew: among&s;t the which is MESSA, hauing a Church not farre from the &s;ea, which they do mo&s;t religiou&s;ly reuerence. For there are &s;ome heere that mo&s;t fondly do beleeue and affirme that the Prophet <HI>Ionas,</HI> when he was &s;ent of God to preach vnto the Niniuites, was at this place ca&s;t vp of the fi&s;h, which before had &s;wallowed him. The &s;parres of this Church and the beames are made of whale bones: for it is a common thing, for the &s;ea to ca&s;t vp heere dead whales of maruailous bigne&s;&s;e. Vpon the coa&s;t al&s;o of this country is found that kind of Amber, which we call <HI>Amber-gree&s;e.</HI> Not farre from this city is TEINT, a towne where all tho&s;e rich skinnes are dre&s;&s;ed, which are commonly called <HI>Maroccho</HI> pelts. More of this kingdome thou mai&s;t read of in <HI>Leo Africanus, Marmolius,</HI> and in the Saracen hi&s;tory of <HI>Caelius Augu&s;tinus Curio,</HI> where he hath a &s;euerall treati&s;e of this prouince. Thus farre of <HI>Maroccho:</HI> it remaineth now that we &s;hould &s;peake likewi&s;e of <HI>Fe&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>FESSE, like as <HI>Maroccho,</HI> is a kingdome &s;o called of the chiefe city and metropolitane of the &s;ame. This city is &s;ituate in the hart and midde&s;t of the kingdome. It was built as they affirme about the yeare of our Lord 786. Neither is it only the head city of this king|dome, but it is e&s;teemed, <HI>The Metropolitane of all Barbary,</HI> and is vulgarly called, as <HI>Marmolius</HI> te&s;tifieth, <HI>The Court of all the We&s;t part of the World.</HI> Some there are which do thinke it to haue been named <HI>Fe&s;&s;e</HI> of a ma&s;&s;e of gold, that heere was found when fir&s;t they began to lay the foundations of the &s;ame: for <HI>fes</HI> in Arabicke &s;ignifieth an heap or ma&s;&s;e. The greate&s;t part of the city &s;tandeth vpon hils, only the midde&s;t of it is plaine and leuell. The riuer vpon which it is &s;eated entreth it at two &s;undry places, (for the one is diuided into two parts) and being entered within the wals it &s;preadeth it &s;elfe almo&s;t into infinite branches, and is by and by, in channels, troughs, and pipes conueighed almo&s;t to euery priuate hou&s;e, church, colledge, inne and ho&s;pitall. La&s;tly, running through their vault, fewers and &s;inkes, it carieth with it all the ordure and &s;oile of the city out into the maine riuer, and by that meanes keepeth it continually near and cleane. The greate&s;t part of their hou&s;es, built of bricke and coloured &s;tones, are very beautifull and do make a goodly &s;hew to the be|holder. Moreouer the open places, galleries and porches are made of a kind of party-coloured bricke or pauement, much like vnto tho&s;e earthen di&s;hes which the Italians call <HI>Maiorica.</HI> The roofe or &s;eelings of their hou&s;es they ouerlay with gold and other mo&s;t orient coloures very finely and gorgeou&s;ly. The toppes of their hou&s;es on the out &s;ide are couered ouer with boord a dare made plaine, &s;o that in the &s;ummer time they may be ouer&s;pread with couerlets and other clothes: for heere in hot weather they v&s;e to lie and &s;leepe all night. <HI>Item,</HI> for the mo&s;t part euery hou&s;e hath a turret &s;euered into many roomes and lofts, whither the women, being toiled and wea|ry, may with-draw them&s;elues, to recreate and refre&s;h their mindes: for from hence they may almo&s;t &s;ee al-ouer the city. Churches and Chappels they haue in this city to the number almo&s;t of 700. whereof 50. are very large and goodlie, mo&s;t &s;umptuou&s;lie built of free

The greate&s;t and chiefe church in this city called <HI>Carrauen,</HI> is of that greatne&s;&s;e that it is &s;aid to be almo&s;t a mile and a halfe about. It hath one and thirty gates of mar|uellous bigne&s;&s;e and height. The &s;teeple of this Church, out of which the people with a very lowd and thundering voice are called to Church, (like as we do v&s;e by the towling of a bell) is very high. Vnderneath this is a cellar or vault, where the oile, lights, lampes, mats and &s;uch other things nece&s;&s;arily and ordinarily v&s;ed in the Church, are kept and laid vp. In this Church there are euery night in the yeare 900. lamps lighted at once. Moreouer, in this city there are more than an hundred Bathes: <HI>Item,</HI> two hundred innes, euery one hauing &s;ix skore chambers apeece at the lea&s;t: for diuers of them haue many more. Euery inne hath a well or fountaine of water priuat to it &s;elfe.

All things which are to be &s;old, haue their &s;euerall market places appointed out for them. There is al&s;o a place a&s;&s;igned as proper to the Merchants, which one may iu&s;tly call a lit|tle city, enclo&s;ed round with a bricke wall.

Notwith&s;tanding heere are about fiue hundred and twenty weauers &s;hops, be&s;ides an hundred &s;hops built for the whiting of thread. Heere is a goodly ca&s;tle, equall in bigne&s;&s;e to a prettie towne, which in time pa&s;t was the Kings hou&s;e where he v&s;ed to keep his court. The&s;e particulars we haue heere and there gathered out of the third book of <HI>Iohn Leo</HI> his de&s;cription of <HI>Africa,</HI> where thou mai&s;t read of very many other things of this city, both plea&s;ant and admirable. <HI>Item Iohn Marmolius</HI> hath written &s;omething of the &s;ame.

<P><HI>_OF Congi</HI> this kingdome of <HI>Africa</HI> (which others corruptly call <HI>Manicongo;</HI> for this word properly &s;ignifieth the king of <HI>Congi,</HI> and cannot he &s;poken of the country alone) my good friend <HI>Philippus Pigafetta,</HI> the authour of this Mappe, wrote a booke in the Italian tongue, this other day imprinted at <HI>Rome.</HI> Which he penned from the mouth and relation of <HI>Odoardo Lopez,</HI> a Por|tugall, who had him&s;elfe been a long time a dweller there, and &s;o a man very skilfull of the &s;tate and &s;ituation of this country, and an ey witne&s;&s;e of that which heere is &s;et downe, out of whom we haue drawen the&s;e few particulars: This kingdome is diuided into the&s;e &s;ix prouinces: <HI>Bamba, Sogno, Sundi, Pango, Batta</HI> and <HI>Pemba.</HI> The fir&s;t of which is inhabited and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a warlike and ve|ry populous nation: &s;o that this one by it &s;elfe is able, if need be, to make <HI>40000.</HI> fighting men. The chiefe city of this prouince, and &s;eat of their Kings, is <HI>Ban&s;a,</HI> which now they call <HI>Citta de S. Saluador.</HI> All this whole prouince is very rich of &s;iluer and other mettals, e&s;pecially about the iland <HI>Loanda,</HI> where al&s;o they catch abundance of tho&s;e &s;hell fi&s;h which breed the pearles: the&s;e they do v&s;e in this kingdome for exchange in buying and &s;elling in &s;teed of money: for heere there is no manner of v&s;e of coine: neither do they much e&s;teeme of gold or &s;iluer. Heere is al&s;o great trafficke for &s;laues, &s;o that the Portugals do yearely buy and carry from hence aboue <HI>5000.</HI> Negroes. This country doth breed great &s;tore of Elephants, which they in their language call <HI>Manzao.</HI> There is al&s;o found in the&s;e quarters a kind of wild bea&s;t, which they call <HI>Zebra,</HI> of the bigne&s;&s;e and fa&s;hion of a mule. But that it is not a mule, it is apparent, in that this bea&s;t is not barren, as the mule is: for this doth breed and bring forth yong, as other bea&s;ts do. The pelt or hide of it is different from tho&s;e of other liuing creatures of like &s;ort: for it is &s;traked with &s;trakes of three diuers colours, namely, blacke, white and yeallow or lion tawny as they call it. It is &s;o wonderfull &s;wift of foote and &s;o wild that by no meanes it may be tamed or be made &s;eruiceable for any v&s;e of man: whereupon they commonly v&s;e this for a prouerbe, <HI>As &s;wift as the Zebra.</HI> There are al&s;o, as in other places, Lions, Tigers, Woolues, Hartes, Hares, Conies, Apes, Chamaeleons with diuers and &s;undry kindes of Serpents: be&s;ide hogges, &s;heep, goats, hennes and parrattes. Crocodiles, which they terme <HI>Cariman,</HI> are heere very plentifull. But hor&s;es, oxen and other bea&s;ts fit for &s;uch kind of &s;eruices and v&s;es for mankind, they haue none at all. Heere doth grow great &s;tore of Palme-trees. Of the leaues of this tree they make and weaue almo&s;t all kind of &s;ilke garments and apparell. For the v&s;e of the &s;ilke-wormes, which in other places is well knowen, is heere altogether vnknowen. The maner of their po&s;ts, or maner of trauell from one place to another (for as we haue &s;hewed before, they haue no hor&s;es) I thinke it well worth the while to &s;et downe in this place, out of the <HI>15.</HI> booke of <HI>Maphey</HI> his Indian hi&s;tories, who affirmeth that they haue no other but wooden hor&s;es; which &s;tory he thus laith downe. Vpon a rafter or beame, &s;aith he, about nine inches thicke, and eight foot long, they &s;pread a piece of a buffe hide of the breadth and compa&s;&s;e of a &s;addle; vpon this the traueller &s;itteth &s;tradling: two men beare the bayard vpon their &s;houlders, and if the iourney be long, then other two do &s;hift and ea&s;e them of their burden. The forena|med authour <HI>Pigafetta,</HI> de&s;cribeth another kind of carying of pa&s;&s;engers from place to place, yet it is not very much different from this. Vpon the North part of this kingdome do abutte the <HI>Anzicanes,</HI> a mankind nation, a people I meane that eateth mans fle&s;h: &s;o that heere mans fle&s;h is openly &s;old in their &s;hambles and fle&s;h markets, as beefe and mutton and other meat is amongst vs. That al&s;o which they report of <HI>Loanda,</HI> an iland vpon the coa&s;t of this country, I thinke it worth the noting in this place; namely, that they &s;ay it lieth &s;o exceeding flatte and low, that it is &s;carcely &s;eene aboue the water, and that it is a made ground compounded of the mudde and &s;and, which the riuer again&s;t which it lieth, ca|&s;teth out into the &s;ea. La&s;tly, that if any man &s;hall digge but two or three handfuls deepe within the ground, he &s;hall find fre&s;h water, very whole&s;ome and good to drinke: and that which is mo&s;t wonderfull, this &s;ame water when the &s;ea ebbeth will he &s;alt, but at full &s;ea only it is fre&s;h. How this nation was by the meanes of King <HI>Iohn,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the yeare of Grace <HI>1491.</HI> conuerted vnto Chri&s;t anity, and with what &s;ucce&s;&s;e they haue continued and gone forward, and yet &s;till con&s;tantly do per&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame, any man that li&s;t, may read of in the forenamed authours; <HI>Pigafetta</HI> in his &s;econd booke: <HI>Maphey,</HI> in his fir&s;t booke of the hi&s;tory of <HI>India:</HI> and <HI>Iohn Barros</HI> in the third chapter of the third booke of his fir&s;t decade of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Before the entrance of the Portugals into this country, the people had no proper names; but were called by com|mon names, &s;uch as al&s;o &s;tones, trees, herbs, birdes, and other creatures amongst them were called by.</P>

<HEAD>THE GEOGRAPHY OF HOLY WRITERS.</HEAD>
<P>_THat which we haue promi&s;ed, behold now, ye &s;tudents of Diuinity and Holy writte, at length we offer to your view, namely, a Map of Sacred Geography, or of &s;uch places as are named by holy writers in the bookes of the Old and New Te&s;taments, whether &s;o ex|actly as the matter requireth and thou doe&s;t looke for, I know not: but that it is done with my be&s;t ability &amp; skill (to which in any matter, and therefore in this e&s;pecially, I dare not much rely.) I know and can truly prote&s;t. Yet notwith&s;tanding, that I haue not bereaued the learned of their due commendation in doing the like; I do acknowledge and do wil|linly confe&s;&s;e, we haue done what we could, &s;eeing that we might not performe what we would. Therefore what heere we offer it is rather our will, than our wi&s;h. Two things, mo&s;t kind Reader, we de|&s;ire thee to ob&s;erue and marke, before thou iudge and cen&s;ure this our labour. Fir&s;t, that in the Geographicall names of places, we haue followed the tran&s;lation of Septuagints: becau&s;e that is but one and vniforme. The Latine tran&s;lations as they are many, &s;o al&s;o they are different, and in naming of places they vary much and di&s;|&s;ent one from another: &s;o that that word which one doth interpret properly, another otherwi&s;e doth tran&s;late it according to the &s;en&s;e and meaning. Which is, that I may v&s;e <HI>Varroes</HI> phra&s;e, to make a noune appellatiue of a proper name: and contrariwi&s;e of proper names to make appellatiues. Examples of which thou mai&s;t &s;ee in the annotations of <HI>Emauel S&agrave;,</HI> as al&s;o in our Geographicall Trea&s;ure. Therefore where we &s;ticke as doubtfull, which of the&s;e different readings and writings of proper names we may take, we runne vnto the 72. interpretours as vn|to a &s;ure ground. It any man be de&s;irous to know how otherwi&s;e the Latine interpretors do call the&s;e proper names, let him haue recour&s;e to our Trea&s;urie, and he &s;hall without any great difficulty ea&s;ily &s;atisfie his de&s;ire. For in this he &s;hall find all the Synonymes of places dige&s;ted according to the order of the Alphabet. The other thing, gentle Reader, which I would haue thee to ob&s;erue, and nece&s;&s;arily ought to be done, lea&s;t preiudice do go before &s;ound iudgement; is this, the &s;eats of all places of <HI>Pale&s;tina</HI> are not &s;et downe in this our Mapp, but a few of tho&s;e that are more famous, according to the capacity of the table: (for thou &s;ee&s;t how &s;traite and nar|row it is:) what heere is wanting may be &s;upplied out of the Tables following; two of <HI>Tileman Stella;</HI> the third in|tituled the <HI>Peregrination of S. Paul,</HI> and the fourth intituled the <HI>Peregrination of the Patriarch Abraham.</HI> For if all the&s;e &s;hould haue been portraitured and ioined together in one and the &s;ame Mappe, it would grow too much too great: yea it would be &s;o great and huge that it would exceed this, which heere we giue; an hundred times; and &s;o by rea&s;on of the greatne&s;&s;e, it would not only be trouble&s;ome in v&s;e, but al&s;o vnplea&s;ant to the eie. In the hart and midde&s;t of the plotte; where thou &s;ee&s;t <HI>Syria,</HI> as it hath been &s;ufficiently repleni&s;hed and filled with places, &s;o in places round about vpon the coa&s;ts on all &s;ides, it is mo&s;t empty and barren: &s;o that it would appeare like a &s;mall iland in the va&s;t ocean, and would &s;oone haue growen into a great, burden&s;ome and chargeable bigne&s;&s;e to no purpo&s;e or profit at all.</P>
<P>We haue vpon the &s;ide in a void place &s;et the Mappe of the whole World, whereby the diligent &s;tudent of Diuinity by conferring might ea&s;ily &s;ee, what and how great a portion of the &s;ame, the holy hi&s;tory doth men|tion and comprehend: and at once; iointly with the &s;ame labour to find out the &s;ituation and po&s;ition of two famous places mentioned in the holy Scriptures: namely of the &s;ituation of the country <HI>Ophyr</HI> and the earthly <HI>Paradi&s;e.</HI> Of the which although many men do write many and diuers things, and the opinions of the learned be different, yet we haue al&s;o &s;et downe our iudgement, willingly giuing leaue to the learned Reader, in his di|&s;cretion, to take which him plea&s;eth: and he may read, if he thinke good, that which in our Geographicall Trea|&s;urie, we haue written more at large of <HI>Ophyr.</HI> Of <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> al&s;o there is the like controuer&s;ie and que&s;tion a|mong&s;t the Diuines. The mo&s;t men do place it in the Ea&s;t, others in <HI>Syria; Po&s;tellus,</HI> vnder the pole Arcticke. Some there are which do ge&s;&s;e it to haue been vnder the Equinoctiall line. <HI>Goropius,</HI> our countrieman, is per&s;wa|ded by many arguments that it was in <HI>Indo&s;cythia,</HI> a prouince of <HI>India</HI> in the Ea&s;t, abutting vpon the riuer <HI>Indus.</HI> Some of the old writers did imagine it to reach as high as the &s;phere of the moone: others do place it in other places. <HI>Cae&s;arius</HI> the brother of <HI>Nazianzene</HI> in his Dialogues, in what place he &s;uppo&s;eth it to be, I cannot deui&s;e: for he maketh <HI>Donaw</HI> one of tho&s;e foure riuers; namely, that which &s;acred antiquity called <HI>Phi&s;on:</HI> this Saint <HI>Hie|rome</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> do vnder&s;tand to haue been <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> others <HI>Ganges</HI> in Ea&s;t <HI>India:</HI> S. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> again&s;t the Manicheies hath this opinion: <HI>Beatam vitam, Paradi&s;i nomine &s;ignificatam exi&s;timo:</HI> By <HI>Paradi&s;e</HI> I do thinke the ble&s;&s;ed life to be vnder&s;tood. Others more later, which purpo&s;edly haue written of the &s;ituation of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> are <HI>Mo&s;es Bar Cepha,</HI> in the Syriacke tongue, and tran&s;lated by the learned <HI>Ma&s;ius; Pererius</HI> vpon <HI>Gene&s;is; Iohn Hopkin&s;on,</HI> an Engli&s;hman, in a peculiar treati&s;e, where al&s;o thou mai&s;t &s;ee a Geographicall Mappe of the &s;ame. Others al&s;o haue done the like, as <HI>Beroaldus</HI> in his Chronicle; <HI>Vadianus</HI> in the de&s;cription of the three quarters of the World; and <HI>Ludouicus Nugarola</HI> in his booke intituled <HI>Timotheus</HI> or <HI>Nilus &amp;c. Phi&s;on</HI> one of the riuers of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> which &s;ome do expound to be <HI>Ganges,</HI> which runneth too farre toward the Ea&s;t; this Mappe by rea&s;on of his narrow|ne&s;&s;e, cannot by any meanes containe: the &s;ituation of which thou mai&s;t &s;ee in another Mappe of ours in this our by-worke, intituled <HI>Aeui veteris Geographiae tabula,</HI> A Geographicall chart of the old World.</P>

<P><HI>_CANAAN,</HI> The mo&s;t ancient name of this country was <HI>Canaan,</HI> which it tooke of <HI>Chanaan</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Cham,</HI> who&s;e po&s;terity diuided it amongst them&s;elues and first inhabited it. Their names were the&s;e, <HI>Sidon, Heth, Iebu&s;y, Emory, Gerge&s;y, Heuy, Arky, Siny, Aruady, Semary,</HI> and <HI>Hamathy,</HI> Gen. <HI>10.15.16.17.18.</HI> Euery one of the&s;e gaue his owne name to that part of the country of <HI>Canaan,</HI> which he enioied for his por|tion and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and of them mention afterward is made <HI>Gen. 13.14.15.23.24.25.27.34.36.38.49.50.

Ezech. 16.27.</HI> This country was called by the name of the <HI>Land of Canaan,</HI> vntill the I&s;ra&euml;lites, hauing partly &s;laine and partly &s;ubdued all the po&s;terity of <HI>Canaan,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame: from which time it be|gan to be called the <HI>Land of I&s;rael,</HI> which name was by the Angell giuen to the Patriarke <HI>Iacob,</HI> for that he had wre&s;tled with God; and from thence the country grew to be called by that name, <HI>Gen. 32.28.</HI> For the word <HI>I&s;ra&euml;l</HI> in the Hebrew tongue &s;ignifieth, to preuaile with God, or a mighty man preuailing again&s;t the mighty God. Heere hence were the &s;onnes and of&s;pring of <HI>Iacob</HI> named <HI>I&s;ra&euml;lites,</HI> and the country wherein they dwelt the <HI>Land of I&s;ra&euml;l;</HI> as is apparant out of the booke of <HI>Iud.</HI> and the <HI>1.</HI> booke of the <HI>Kings.</HI> Although the whole land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> were indeed generally called <HI>I&s;ra&euml;l,</HI> yet neuerthele&s;&s;e the portion or iu|ri&s;diction of euery Tribe, which &s;euerally <HI>Io&s;ua</HI> a&s;&s;igned to euery one of the twelue Patriarkes, receiued a proper appellation of the chiefe of that family, as is apparant by diuers places of Holy Scripture.</P>
<P>The names of the Tribes were the&s;e, <HI>Ruben, Simeon, Iuda, Zebulon, I&s;a&s;char, Dan, Gad, A&s;er, Nephtali, Beniamin, Mana&s;&s;e, Ephraim:</HI> and &s;o the name of euery one of the &s;onnes of <HI>Iacob,</HI> remained in his po&s;terity and place of abode in the &s;ame, &s;o that the whole land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> was diuided into twelue parts, as the holy Scripture doth te&s;tifie.</P>
<P>Then vnder <HI>Roboam,</HI> when as <HI>I&s;rael</HI> and that kingdome was rent into two parts, the Tribes of <HI>Iuda</HI> and <HI>Beniamin,</HI> being vnited, retained the name of <HI>Iuda:</HI> and that for the&s;e rea&s;ons: Fir&s;t, for that of the two it was the mightie&s;t: Secondly, by rea&s;on that out of it the Me&s;&s;ias was to come, it was the more famous, and the name of the whole was taken from the mo&s;t honourable. But the other tenne Tribes, which were commanded by the Kings of <HI>Samaria,</HI> &s;till retained the ancient name, and were called <HI>I&s;ra&euml;l.</HI></P>
<P>Againe, the later part, after the captiuity of <HI>Babylon,</HI> was diuided into two prouinces, <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Galilee. Samaria</HI> the Metropolitane or chiefe city (of which the country tooke the name) was the &s;eat of the Kings of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> But <HI>Galilee</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and inhabited by forreners and &s;trangers, <HI>3. King. 9.</HI> and <HI>4. King. 17.</HI> and therefore grew to be much enuied and de&s;pi&s;ed of the re&s;t of the Iewes: &s;o that they did v&s;e to &s;peake all villany and reproachfull &s;peaches of the people of this prouince. The North part of this in &s;corne was called <HI>Galiley of the Gentiles,</HI> and in re&s;pect of the &s;ituation, the <HI>Higher Galiley:</HI> the other part of it, toward the South, was called the <HI>Lower Galiley.</HI> Therefore after|ward euen vnto the time of Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles, and &s;o foorth, the land of <HI>Chanaan</HI> or <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was diuided into three parts, and called by three di&s;tinct names. The Higher country toward <HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Tyre,</HI> they called <HI>Galiley;</HI> the Middle, <HI>Samaria;</HI> the Lower, toward the South and <HI>Arabia Petraea,</HI> was properly called <HI>Iudaea,</HI> Iewrie, as is manife&s;t out of the &s;econd chapter of Saint <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the fourth of Saint <HI>Iohn.</HI> This later did containe onely two Tribes, <HI>Iuda</HI> and <HI>Beniamin.</HI> Although al&s;o all the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> euen as high as the mountaines of <HI>Thra|con</HI> neere <HI>Antioch,</HI> and the country of <HI>Ammon,</HI> was called <HI>Iudaea,</HI> as is euident by the ninteenth chapter of Saint <HI>Matthew,</HI> and the tenth of Saint <HI>Marke:</HI> and therefore al&s;o <HI>Pliny</HI> mentioneth <HI>Iudaea citerior, Iewry</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Iordan. Strabo</HI> in his &s;ixteenth booke, and <HI>Lucane</HI> in his &s;econd booke do al&s;o call the &s;ame <HI>Iudaea:</HI> which name, as we &s;aid before, had the originall from the Tribe of <HI>Iuda. Ptolemey</HI> and others call it <HI>Palae&s;tina,</HI> of the <HI>Palae&s;tini,</HI> which according to the propriety of the Hebrew pronunciation in the Holy Scriptures are named <HI>Phili&s;tiim,</HI> (Pheli&s;tines) this Nation indeed both for their great command and warres made with their neighbours for certaine yeares together, were very famous. <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Polymnia</HI> and <HI>Dion</HI> in his &s;euen and twentieth booke, calleth that part of <HI>Syria</HI> which is next to <HI>Aegypt, Syriam Pa|lae&s;tinam, Palae&s;tina</HI> of <HI>Syria. Ptolemey</HI> calleth it <HI>Palae&s;tinam Iudaeam, Palae&s;tina</HI> of <HI>Iewrie,</HI> or <HI>Palae&s;tinam Syriae, Palae&s;tina</HI> of <HI>Syria:</HI> Becau&s;e that <HI>Palae&s;tina</HI> is a part of <HI>Syria,</HI> as <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> thinketh, who calleth it <HI>Syriam Iudaeae, Syria</HI> of <HI>Iudaea.</HI> Many places of this <HI>Palae&s;tina</HI> are expre&s;&s;ed in that his Mappe: and therefore heere they are omitted.</P>
<P><HI>OF AEGYPT.</HI> The country &s;ituate between <HI>Syene,</HI> or the <HI>Catarractae Nili,</HI> the fall or mouthes of <HI>Nilus;</HI> through the midde&s;t of which this riuer runneth, and by his yearely inundation and ouerflowing, watereth all the grounds of the &s;ame, in old time was called <HI>CHAM,</HI> of <HI>Cham</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Noe,</HI> to who&s;e lot this country fell when the world was diuided pre&s;ently after the confu&s;ion at <HI>Babel; P&s;alm. 78. v. 51. &amp; 105. v. 23.</HI> and <HI>106. v. 22.</HI> Afterward it was called <HI>Mi&s;raim,</HI> of <HI>Mi&s;raim</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Cham, Gen. 5.</HI> and <HI>10. Io&s;ephus</HI> in the twelfth chapter of his fir&s;t booke calleth it <HI>Mer&s;in,</HI> which name doubtle&s;&s;e is made of <HI>Mi&s;raim,</HI> either by contraction or &s;hort kind of &s;peaking, depraued by cu&s;tome, or fault of the writer. <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Euterpe</HI> affirmeth, that <HI>Aegypt</HI> was &s;ometime named <HI>Thebes.</HI> Of &s;ome it was called <HI>A&euml;ria,</HI> or <HI>A&euml;tia,</HI> as &s;ome copies write it. <HI>Marmolius Theuer,</HI> and <HI>Pinetus</HI> affirme that the Turkes, and country people in and about <HI>Aegypt,</HI> do now call this country <HI>Chibth, Elchibet</HI> or <HI>Elchebitz.</HI> And indeed the Arabs that turned <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> the fir&s;t booke of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> into Arabicke, in the <HI>45.</HI> and <HI>46.</HI> chapters, for <HI>Aegypt</HI> hath <HI>Elchibth,</HI> from whence no doubt, the Greekes and Latines fetched their <HI>Aegyptus:</HI> like as of <HI>Phrat,</HI> the Hebrew name is made <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aegypt</HI> had three &s;peciall prouinces or &s;hires; the Higher, which was called <HI>Thebaica,</HI> the Middle and the Lower. <HI>Thebaica</HI> and the Middle&s;hire of <HI>Aegypt</HI> which the mountaines of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and the vtter &s;ection or parting of the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> at <HI>Sebemytus</HI> do define, are cal|led the <HI>Higher Egypt;</HI> through the midde&s;t of which the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> doth iointly runne in one maine channell: and is both vpon the Ea&s;t and We&s;t enclo&s;ed with high and &s;teep mountaines. The other Prouince, from thence euen vnto the Aegyptian &s;ea, is called the <HI>Lower Egypt.</HI> This al&s;e they call <HI>Delta:</HI> for that this country or part of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which is conteined between the parting of the riuer at <HI>Sebemytus, Canopus</HI> and <HI>Pelu&s;ium,</HI> or the two mouthes of the &s;ame riuer where it falleth into the Mediterran &s;ea, neere the&s;e townes, is in fa&s;hion three cornered, or triangular repre&s;enting the forme of the Greeke Capitall letter &Dgr;.</P>
<P>The&s;e countries by the di&s;creet adui&s;e of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, were diuided into &Ngr;&Ogr;&Mgr;&Ogr;&OHgr;&Sgr;, that is, Shires: for by <HI>Nom&ograve;s, Nom&edot;</HI> and <HI>Nomarch&iacute;a,</HI> the Greekes do vnder&s;tand a &s;hire and ward, ouer the which is &s;et <HI>Nom&aacute;rches,</HI> a Lieutenant or Lord-warden. <HI>Thebes</HI> com|prehended tenne &s;hires, and the middle prouince &s;ixteen &s;hires: &s;o that in all, the Higher <HI>Egypt</HI> conteined &s;ix and twenty &s;hires. But in the Low|er <HI>Egypt</HI> or <HI>Delta</HI> there were onely tenne.</P>
<P><HI>Egypt</HI> is very often mentioned in the holy Scripture: and the places where it is &s;poken of, are very famous and memorable: <HI>Gehon,</HI> that is, as &s;ome do expound, <HI>Nilus, Gen. 2.13. Beth&s;hemeth,</HI> the Sunnes hou&s;e, <HI>Heliopolis</HI> the Greekes call it, <HI>Gen. 41.</HI> and <HI>46. E&s;a. 19.</HI> This al&s;o is called <HI>On, Ezech. 30.

<P><HI>OF ARABIA.</HI> This country the Hebrews call <HI>Arab,</HI> that is, a mi&s;ture, hotchpotch or dwelling of diuers and &s;undrie Nations together in one and the &s;ame country, as is probably to be gathered out of the &s;ix and twentith chapter of the &s;econd booke of Chronicles.

It &s;ometime did belong to the Edomites and Amalechites, and was a part of their lands and country. Whereupon the I&s;raelites by the commandement of God were con&s;trained to pa&s;&s;e by this country. Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> &s;aith that <HI>Petra</HI> the city, is of the Hebrews called <HI>Iacteel,</HI> and of the Syrians <HI>Recem.</HI> This country by rea&s;on of the pa&s;&s;age of the children of I&s;rael through it, and the great workes and wonders of God done in it, is very famous and oft mentioned in the holy Scriptures. The places of it oft &s;poken of in the booke of God, are the&s;e: The Red &s;ea, <HI>Exod. 13.14.15.23. Num. 11.14.21.33. Deut. 1.2.11. Io&s;u. 2.24. P&s;alm. 77.105.113. Act. 7.1. Cor. 10.

The wilderne&s;&s;e of <HI>Sin, Exod. 16.

Raphidim, Exod. 17.19. Horeb, Exod. 3.17.</HI> Ob&s;erue in this place, that <HI>Horeb</HI> was part of tho&s;e moun|taines which the Greekes call <HI>M&eacute;lanas,</HI> that is, the Blacke hils; which are of &s;uch a wonderfull height, that vpon the toppe of them the &s;unne may be de&s;cried at the fourth watch of the night, that is, about three of foure of the clocke in the morning, an houre or two before her appearance to tho&s;e which dwell in the plaine. But <HI>Sinay</HI> was the Ea&s;t part or ridge of mount <HI>Horeb.</HI> This is proued by the&s;e places of Scripture, <HI>Exod. 33. Deut. 4.5.9.10.29. P&s;alm. 105. Actor. 7.</HI> In <HI>Deut. 33.

Which man&s;ions, and encamping places of theirs, were greatly famou&s;ed with many miracles and wonderfull workes of God, which he wrought there in the &s;ight of that peruer&s;e and froward generation. The&s;e places were not remote one from another by equall di&s;tances, as is very probable by the&s;e places of the Old Te&s;tament, <HI>Exod. 14.15.19. Num. 10.14.33.</HI> Neither did the people of <HI>I&s;|rael,</HI> being led through this wilderne&s;&s;e vp and downe, euer cro&s;&s;e the fir&s;t way which they had gone before: but by winding &amp; turning this way and that way, they came thri&s;e to the Red-&s;ea: as may ea&s;ily be demon&s;trated out of the three and thirtieth of <HI>Numbers,</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>Deuterono|my,</HI> and the eleuenth of <HI>Iudges.</HI> The&s;e do nece&s;&s;arily appertaine to the vnder&s;tanding of the tract of that their iourney and orderly placing of tho&s;e for&s;aid man&s;ions and re&s;ting places.</P>
<P>Of <HI>SYRIA</HI> and <HI>PHOENICIA.</HI> Although in old time the name of <HI>SYRIA,</HI> and the bounds thereof were more large: yet that is pro|perly called <HI>Syria</HI> which is enclo&s;ed within the mount <HI>Amanus, (Monte Negro, Po&s;tellus</HI> calleth it) a part of the riuer <HI>Euphrates, Iudaea,</HI> and the Phoenician &s;ea. <HI>PHOENICIA</HI> a part of <HI>Syria,</HI> famous by many rea&s;ons and accidents, amongst his more notable cities had <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon:</HI> But the chiefe or Metropolitane city of <HI>COELESYRIA, (Hollow Syria</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> in <HI>Syria</HI> we may call it) lying Ea&s;tward from <HI>Iudaea,</HI> was <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> oft mentioned both in holy and prophane writers.

For <HI>Sidon</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Canaan</HI> built the city <HI>Sidon.</HI> And in the tenth chapter of <HI>Gene&s;is,</HI> the land of <HI>Canaan</HI> is &s;o de&s;cribed, as it is certaine that it contained all that whole tract of ground which afterward the I&s;raelites did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, from <HI>Iordan</HI> euen vnto the &s;ea, and &s;o along as farre as <HI>Aegypt.</HI> There as yet was no di&s;tinction between the <HI>Phili&s;tiim</HI> and <HI>Canaan.</HI> For <HI>Canaan</HI> al&s;o was ancienter than <HI>Phili&s;tiim,</HI> which was not borne of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but of <HI>Mi&s;raim.</HI> Yet afterward when the power and iuri&s;diction of the Nation of the Phili&s;tines grew to &s;ome heigth and greatne&s;&s;e, they cau&s;ed the country, e&s;pecially all along the &s;ea coa&s;t, beneath <HI>Tyre</HI> Southward, to be called after their name <HI>PALESTINA.</HI> And in the <HI>13.</HI> chapter of the booke of <HI>Io&s;ua</HI> there are reckoned vp <HI>5.</HI> cities of the Phili&s;tines, <HI>Azotus, Accaron, A&s;calon, Geth</HI> and <HI>Gaza.</HI> When therefore the Canaa|nites for that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the places neere <HI>Iordan,</HI> were almost vtterly de&s;troied, their name by a little and little began to peri&s;h and to fade away. And although al&s;o the Phili&s;tines, which greatly enlarged their bounds and territories in that countrie, which afterward was giuen to the tribes of <HI>Iuda, Beniamin, Simeon, Mana&s;|&s;es,</HI> and <HI>I&s;a&s;char,</HI> were driuen from thence, and were for the mo&s;t part con&s;umed: yet they retained, as I &s;aid, certaine &s;trong cities vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t beneath <HI>Tyre,</HI> and &s;o &s;omewhile they greatly flouri&s;h and were lords ouer others: within a while after they grew weaker and were commanded of others. In the time of <HI>Abraham</HI> the &s;eat and court of <HI>Abimelech</HI> was at <HI>Gerar,</HI> who in the <HI>26.</HI> chapter of <HI>Gen.</HI> is named King of the Phili&s;tines. The city <HI>Gerara</HI> was &s;ituate in that country which af|terward the tribe of <HI>Iuda</HI> did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, not farre from <HI>Hebron:</HI> and was indeed placed between <HI>Hebron</HI> and <HI>Gaza.</HI> It is therefore to be conceiued that the name of <HI>Cananaea, Canaan</HI> is &s;omewhat more ancient, and comprehending more Nations, than the name of the Phili&s;tines, which neuer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all that tract and compa&s;&s;e of ground which afterward the I&s;raelites enioyed. But notwith&s;tanding becau&s;e the Phili&s;tines had certaine great cities vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t, the name of <HI>Palae&s;tina</HI> was, by rea&s;on of their traffique, more famous and better knowen to the Greeke writers, than <HI>Canaan</HI> or <HI>Cananaea. Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Polymnia</HI> &s;aith, that the Phoeni|cians and Syrians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>Palae&s;tina</HI> &s;ent <HI>300.</HI> &s;aile of &s;hips to <HI>Xerxes,</HI> and afterward he addeth that the whole country, euen from the skirtes of <HI>Aegypt</HI> vnto <HI>Phoe|nicia,</HI> was called <HI>Pale&s;tina.</HI> And therefore al&s;o afterward the Greekes, as <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> vnder the name of <HI>Palae&s;tina</HI> haue comprehended <HI>Iudaea, Samaria</HI> and <HI>Gali|ley,</HI> when as notwith&s;tanding the Phili&s;tines did not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e all that large &s;pace and compa&s;&s;e of ground. But often times names are giuen to countries of &s;ome principall prouince of the &s;ame, that doth in power and command &s;urpa&s;&s;e the re&s;t. The Grammaticall interpretation and rea&s;on of the Etymology of the word <HI>Phili&s;tim,</HI> is thought to be, for that this nation inhabiting along the &s;ea coa&s;t, where earthquakes are very frequent, and &s;o whole townes and cities are couered with &s;and, be&s;prink|led and &s;oiled with du&s;t and dirt. For the word in the Hebrew tongue &s;ignifieth Sprinklers, or be&s;prinklings, as when any thing is be&s;prinkled and foiled with du&s;t: or it &s;ignifieth otherwi&s;e Batteries and &s;hakings, as when a building is violently &s;haken and mooued by an externall force, whereby it is in danger and ready to fall. Like as <HI>A&s;calon</HI> and <HI>Azotus</HI> hauing their names giuen them of <HI>E&s;h,</HI> fire. <HI>CAPERNAVM,</HI> that is, a plea&s;ant and delightfull village. Heere Chri&s;t fir&s;t began to publi&s;h his Go&s;pel, <HI>Matth. 4.

Therefore of Chri&s;t and his Di&s;ciples they demanded there a didrachma for poll mony, as of the re&s;t of the citizens and dwellers in this city. Of this city mention is made <HI>Matth. 8.11.17. Marc. 1.2.5.9. Luc. 4.7. Io. 2.6. DALMANVTHA,</HI> that is, the poore mens habitation. Chri&s;t with his Di&s;ciples came al&s;o into this country. <HI>Matth. 16. Marc. 8.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DAMASCVS.</HI> It is di&s;tant from <HI>Ieru&s;alem 42.</HI> Germane miles. <HI>Breitenbach</HI> writeth that <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> is <HI>6.</HI> daies iourney from <HI>Ieru&s;alem.</HI> The map &s;heweth the &s;ituation of it to be in the mount <HI>Antilibanas.</HI> It is a very ancient city, which al&s;o at this day is very populous and much frequented by merchants. Diuers etymo|logies and rea&s;ons of the impo&s;ition of this name, diuers men do curiou&s;ly &s;eeke; I do hold this for the likelie&s;t, The &s;acke of blood: becau&s;e the old opinion is, that in this place <HI>Abel</HI> was &s;laine by his brother <HI>Cain.</HI> Surely it is very probable and generally agreed vpon, that our fir&s;t parents <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eue</HI> did fir&s;t dwell not farre from this place. <HI>DECAPOLIS,</HI> the name of a prouince in the vttermo&s;t skirtes of <HI>Phoenicia</HI> and <HI>Galiley,</HI> which comprehended tenne cities: the&s;e, although tho&s;e au|thours, which write of them, do not wholly agree which they &s;hould be, it is certaine by the iudgement of all men, were neighbour cities. And it is that country which is conteined between <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> and <HI>Sidon:</HI> and between the Lake <HI>Gene&s;areth</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;area Philippi.</HI></P>
<P><HI>EMMAVS,</HI> afterward it was called <HI>Nicopolis.</HI> And in my iudgement the Greek name is but an interpretation &amp; &s;en&s;e of the Hebrew name, which &s;ignifieth the mo|ther of &s;trength &amp; fortitude or victory. Others haue giuen out that the interpretation of it is, the Mother of coun&s;ell. <HI>EPHRATA,</HI> which al&s;o is otherwi&s;e called <HI>Beth&aacute;|chem</HI> or <HI>Bethl&eacute;hem,</HI> as our bookes vulgarly haue. <HI>Ephrata,</HI> &s;ignifieth abundance, fertility; a fertile &s;oile plentifully bringing foorth all maner of fruites. For in the whole earth there was no place more fruitfull than <HI>Ephrata,</HI> that is, than <HI>Bethl&aacute;chem,</HI> where <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> the Lord of <HI>Heauen</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and Redeemer of all mankind, was borne: whom the Proph t <HI>Micheas,</HI> in his fift chapter, did foretell &s;hould be borne in this place. And therefore was it called <HI>Bethlachem,</HI> that is, The hou&s;e of Bread. In the &s;ame place was al&s;o &s;eated <HI>Bethhacaris, (Beth-haccarem,</HI> I thinke he meaneth) that is, the hou&s;e of vineyeards. <HI>Bethlachem</HI> was the na|tiue &s;oile of <HI>Dauid,</HI> where he was annointed king of <HI>I&s;rael, 1. King. 16.17. GALGAL,</HI> this word &s;ignifieth a wheele, or a wheeling and turning about, the trundling of any thing that is round. It may be that this name was giuen to that place and ro&s;e vpon this occa&s;ion, for that <HI>Io&s;ua</HI> the captaine and generall of the I&s;raelites, out of the camp heere and &s;tanding garri&s;ons, did v&s;e to draw new &s;upplies and armies, wherewith he conquered and ouercame the enemies, and by chacing vp and down and continually vexing the nations round about, at length vtterly con&s;umed them. Heere the royall army and campe was continually re&s;ident, vntill &s;uch time as the whole land was diuided into <HI>12.</HI> tribes, and &s;o was quietly and freely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and inhabited of the I&s;raelites. The&s;e were the fir&s;t campes that the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> had in <HI>Iudaea,</HI> the land of promi&s;e, and heere the Manna cea&s;&s;ed. For now they began to eat and liue vpon the fruites of the land. Heere al&s;o the Pa&s;&s;eouer was celebrated, and all tho&s;e almo&s;t were heere circumci&s;ed which had pa&s;&s;ed ouer <HI>Iordan.</HI> For they which had been circumci&s;ed in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> they were dead long &s;ince in the wildernes, <HI>Io&s;. 4.5.</HI> The &s;ame <HI>Galgala</HI> is me~tioned in the <HI>1. king 11.15 2. king. 19 4 king. 4.

<P><HI>GAZA, AZOTVS, ASCAION, GETH, ACCARON.</HI> The expo&s;ition of which names it thus: <HI>Gaza</HI> or <HI>Aza</HI> &s;ignifieth &s;trength or might. <HI>Azotus</HI> or <HI>A&s;|dod</HI> a robbing or &s;poiling, or el&s;e, the fire of the beloued: or rather in my iudgement, a fortification, bulwarke, blockhou&s;e or muniment: for &s;o the Arabicke, a neere dia|lect of the Hebrew tongue, doth most properly &s;ignifie.

Hebron,</HI> oft mentioned in diuers places of Holy Scripture had many more ancient names. Of which one was <HI>Cariath-arbe,</HI> that is, <HI>Tetrapolis,</HI> Foure cities. For antiquity diuided the principall and Metropolitane cities into foure parts: (wardes we would call them) The fir&s;t was the court of the Prince, where al&s;o the Coun&s;ell, the Nobility and Princes did keep: The &s;econd, was for the &s;ouldiers and military men: The third, was re&s;erued for the hu&s;bandmen: In the Fourth, the artificers and tradesmen dwelt. There al&s;o was the vale of <HI>Mamre,</HI> &s;o called of an Ammonite who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, <HI>Gen. 14.</HI> and made a league with <HI>Abraham.</HI> Heere three gue&s;ts who went to de&s;troy <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrhe,</HI> were interteined of <HI>Abraham.</HI> There <HI>Abraham</HI> buried <HI>Sara</HI> his wife, <HI>Gen. 23.</HI> And therefore &s;ome thinke it was cal|led <HI>Ciriath-arbe,</HI> that is <HI>tetrapolis,</HI> the city of <HI>4</HI> great men; for that heere were buried <HI>4.</HI> Patriarkes, <HI>Adam, Abraham, I&s;aac,</HI> and <HI>Iacob, Gen. 25.35.49. IA|BOC,</HI> the riuer <HI>Iaboc,</HI> that is, of emptine&s;&s;e, or &s;cattering or wre&s;tling. The things done heere, and the hi&s;tories recorded are agreeable to the etymologie and rea&s;on of the name: for heere <HI>Iacob</HI> wre&s;tled with the Angell, and therefore he was after that named <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> that is, a Prince of God, or preuailing with God. But the place where he wre&s;tled, <HI>Iacob</HI> called <HI>Penuel,</HI> that is, &s;eeing God, or the face of God.</P>
<P><HI>IERICHO.</HI> Some do expound it, his moone, others his mon'ths, or his &s;mell. We do approue the later expo&s;ition of &s;melling, rather than either of the two former: and that for the plea&s;ant and fragrant &s;mell which partly i&s;&s;ued from the gardens and orchyeards of the rare and &s;oueraigne Bal&s;am, a plant only growing in this place: and partly from the Palmetrees, which heere do grow in greater abundance, than any where el&s;e in the world be&s;ide. And therefore in the <HI>34.</HI> of <HI>Deut.</HI> it is called the <HI>City of Palme trees. IERVSALEM,</HI> that is, The vi&s;ion of peace. It enclo&s;ed two mountaines, vpon the which it &s;tood: the name of the one was <HI>Sion,</HI> vpon the which &s;tood the ca&s;tle or palace of <HI>Dauid.</HI> Now <HI>Sion</HI> &s;ignifieth a watch tower, a beacon. The name of the other was <HI>Moria,</HI> vpon which the temple of <HI>Salomon</HI> was built. For the very name al&s;o doth &s;hew, that the fathers in old time did &s;acrifice in that place. And <HI>Abraham</HI> lead his &s;onne <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> to &s;acrifice him to the Lord, to this moun|taine. As concerning the etymologie of <HI>mor-iah,</HI> we are contented with that deriuation of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who nameth it, God &s;hall &s;ee. Therefore let this be receiued that <HI>mor-iah</HI> &s;ignifieth, the beholding or the demon&s;tration of God. Yet other etymologies and deriuations, are not altogether from the purpo&s;e and to be reiected, as the&s;e, the illumination of God, or the feare of God. <HI>IORDANIS.</HI> A famous riuer running through the midde&s;t of the country, ari&s;ing out of the foot of the mount <HI>Libanus.</HI> It hath two fountaines or heads, like vnto our riuer of <HI>Thames;</HI> one called by the name of <HI>Ior,</HI> which name in the Hebrew tongue &s;ignifieth a brooke: the other by the name of <HI>Dan.</HI> The&s;e meeting and running together in one channell, they are called by one name <HI>Iordan,</HI> compound of the names of the &s;euerall heads.</P>
<P><HI>MACHANAIM,</HI> that is, two camps, <HI>Gen. 23.</HI> The&s;e are the campes of God, as <HI>Iacob</HI> him&s;elfe nameth this place.

Whereupon he called this place <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> the tents or camp of God, that is, the pre&s;ence and gard or garri&s;on of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>NAIM,</HI> a city &s;o called of the plea&s;ant &s;ituation of it, as &s;eemeth by the etymologie of the word: for <HI>Nahim,</HI> &s;ignifieth plea&s;ant, delight&s;ome. Our Sauiour Chri&s;t going from <HI>Capernaum,</HI> entreth into <HI>Naim,</HI> and in the very gate and entrance of the city, he rai&s;eth the only &s;onne of a widdow from death to life, and &s;o turneth the heauine&s;&s;e and mourning of the mother into ioy and gladne&s;&s;e.</P>

<P>_THere is no man of meane learning but doth know, that the knowledge of Geography and skill of Mappes and Chartes, is nece&s;&s;ary for the vnder&s;tanding of the hi&s;toricall bookes of holy Scrip|ture: and if they will not confe&s;&s;e it, yet the thing it &s;elfe doth &s;ufficiently approue it to be &s;o.

For we haue made it to be a valley lying between the moun|taines, watered all along from one end to the other, by the riuer <HI>Iordan,</HI> in which then &s;tood the&s;e fiue citities, <HI>So|dom, Gomorrhe, Admah, Zeboim</HI> and <HI>Segor.</HI> Which place why and how afterward it was conuerted into a lake, the holy Scriptures do at large and copiou&s;ly de&s;cribe. <HI>Io&s;ephus,</HI> in the 5. chapter of his 5. booke of the warres of the Iewes, thus di&s;cour&s;eth of it: It is, &s;aith he, a &s;alt and barren lake, in which by rea&s;on of the great lightne&s;&s;e, euen the heauie&s;t things that are, being ca&s;t into it, do &s;wimme vpon the toppe of the water: to &s;inke or go downe to the bot|tome a man &s;hall hardly do, although he would. La&s;tly, <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> the Emperour, who came thither of purpo&s;e to &s;ee it, commanded certaine fellowes that could not &s;wimme, to haue their hands bound behind them and to be ca&s;t into the midde&s;t and deepe&s;t place of it; and it came to pa&s;&s;e that all of them did flote vpon the toppe of the water, as if they had been forced vpward by the aire or &s;pirits ari|&s;ing from the bottome. Moreouer the diuer&s;ity of the colours of this lake, which changeth and turneth the toppe of the water thri&s;e in a day, and by diuers po&s;itions and falling of the &s;unne beames vpon it, giueth a lu&s;ture round about, is mo&s;t wonderfull. In many places it &s;peweth foorth blacke lumpes of <HI>bitumen,</HI> which do &s;wimme aloft vpon the toppe of the lake in forme and bigne&s;&s;e of blacke oxen without heads. But when tho&s;e that farme the lake do come, finding a lumpe &s;o clotted together, they draw it to their &s;hippes: and becau&s;e it is tough, being full, they cannot breake them off: but as it were binding to the boate it hangeth to the knoll, vntill it be di&s;&s;olued by the men&s;trues of women, or with vrine, <HI>this</HI> Pliny <HI>in the fifteenth chapter of the &s;euenth booke of his Naturall hi&s;tory, attributeth to a threed &s;tained with a womans men&s;trues.</HI>] It is good not only for the &s;topping of the ioints of &s;hippes, but is al&s;o mingled with many medicines v&s;uall in the cure of di&s;ea&s;ed bodies. The length of this lake is 580. furlongs, extending it &s;elfe euen vp to <HI>Zoara</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI> The breadth of it is 150. furlongs ouer. [Diodorus Siculus <HI>maketh it but</HI> 500. <HI>furlongs in length, and three &s;core in breadth.</HI>] The land of <HI>Sodome,</HI> &s;ometime a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and happy prouince for all kind of wealth and commodities, but now all burnt vp, being indeed, as ancient records make mention, for the wickedne&s;&s;e of the inhabitants con&s;umed by fire from heauen, was not farre from this place. La&s;tly, as yet &s;ome remnants of that wrathfull fire, both in the foundations and plots of tho&s;e fiue cities, and the a&s;hes grow|ing vp together with the fruites of the earth (which to &s;ee to are like vnto good whole&s;ome fruites, but being touched they pre&s;ently vani&s;h into &s;moake and a&s;hes) are to this day to be &s;eene. Thus farre out of <HI>Io&s;ephus. Tacitus</HI> in the fifth booke of his hi&s;tories reporteth almo&s;t the &s;ame of it <HI>Verbatim,</HI> but that he affirmeth, that the heaps and lumps of <HI>bitumen</HI> after that they are drawen to the &s;hore, and are dried partly by the heat of the &s;unne and partly by the vapours of the earth, are cleft and hewed out with axes. Moreouer he addeth, that this lake, in &s;hew like the &s;ea, but much more corrupt and &s;tinking both in ta&s;t and &s;mell, is pe&s;tilent and vnwhole&s;ome vnto the neighbours round about: againe, that it is neuer moued or driuen to and fro with the wind, nor &s;uffereth any fi&s;h, or water foules to liue in it, as in other waters: yea it entertaineth no manner of liuing creatures, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> and <HI>Hege&s;ippus,</HI> in the fourth chapter of his eighteenth booke, do write; &s;o that, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, buls and camels do &s;wimme and flote aloft vpon the toppe of the water of this lake. The &s;ame things <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, but vnder the name of the lake <HI>Sirbon,</HI> very fal&s;ly: for it is another lake in this country different from this. <HI>Diodorus</HI> te&s;tifieth that the water of it is bitter and &s;tinking: <HI>Item,</HI> that it beareth vp all things that haue breath, except tho&s;e things that are ma&s;&s;y and &s;olide, as gold, &s;iluer, and &s;uch like, although euen tho&s;e al&s;o do heere &s;inke more &s;lowly than in other lakes. See more of this in the &s;ame authour in his 2. and 19. bookes. That all vegetable things that liue not, do &s;inke to the bottome: and that it will beare vp no &s;uch thing except it be be&s;mered ouer with <HI>bitumen, (alumen,</HI> &s;ome copies haue) <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> doth te&s;tifie in the 36. booke of his hi&s;tory. That a lamp or candle light, will &s;wimme aloft; but being out, will &s;inke, <HI>I&s;idorus</HI> hath &s;et down, as a truth, by the relation of others. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in the &s;econd booke of his Meteorologicks doth write, that the water of this lake doth white cloths, if one &s;hall but &s;hake them well, being only wette in the &s;ame. Of the fruites like vnto tho&s;e which are whole&s;ome and good to be eaten, yet in|deed do vani&s;h into a&s;hes, be&s;ide the forenamed authours, <HI>Solinus, Io&s;ephus, S. Augu&s;tine</HI> and <HI>Tertullian,</HI> do witne&s;&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding they do all affirme it of apples, not generally of all fruites. <HI>Hege&s;ippus</HI> to the&s;e addeth clu&s;ters of grapes, in &s;hape and fa&s;hion not in &s;ub&s;tance. <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth that this falleth out not only to all naturall things ari&s;ing out of the earth of their owne accord, but al&s;o to artificiall things made by hand and ingenious inuention of man. This then is the nature and re&s;emblance of this place now, which was &s;ometime as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> te&s;tifieth, <HI>Gen.</HI> 13.10. to &s;ee to, as glorious as the garden or Paradi&s;e of God.</P>
<P>To the&s;e we thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to adioine the opinion of <HI>Nubien&s;is</HI> the Arabian, as he hath &s;et it downe in the fifth Section of the third Climate of his Geographicall garden, imprinted in the Arabicke language, at <HI>Rome</HI> in the yeare of our Lord 1592. <HI>The place, &s;aith he, where</HI> Lot <HI>with his family dwelt, the &s;tinking &s;ea and</HI> Zegor, <HI>euen vp as high as</HI> Ba&s;an <HI>and</HI> Tiberias <HI>was called the</HI> Vale, <HI>for that it was a plaine or bottome between two hils &s;o low that all the other waters of this part of</HI> Soria <HI>do fall into it and are gathered thither.</HI> And a little beneath in the &s;ame place he addeth. <HI>All the brookes and &s;prings do meet and &s;tay in the lake of</HI> Zegor, <HI>otherwi&s;e called the lake</HI> of Sodom and Gomorrha, <HI>two cities where</HI> Lot <HI>and his family dwelt, which God did cau&s;e to &s;inke, and conuerted their place into a &s;tinking lake, otherwi&s;e named</HI> The Dead lake, <HI>for that there is in it nothing that hath breath or life, nei|ther fi&s;h, nor worme, or any &s;uch thing as v&s;ually is wont to liue or keepe in &s;tanding or running waters: the water of this lake is hot and of a filthy &s;tinking &s;a|uour: yet vpon it are little boates in which they pa&s;&s;e from place to place in the&s;e quarters, and carry their proui&s;ion. The length of this lake is</HI> 60. <HI>miles, the breadth not aboue</HI> 12. <HI>miles.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Aben I&s;aac,</HI> who in like maner wrote in the Arabicke tongue, a treati&s;e of Geography (certaine frag|ments of which I haue by me, for which I am beholding, as al&s;o for many other fauours to Ma&s;ter <HI>Edward Wright,</HI> that learned Mathematician, and &s;ingular louer of all maner literature) thus &s;peaketh of this place: <HI>The &s;ea</HI> Alzengie, <HI>&s;aith he, is a very bad and dangerous &s;ea: for there is no liuing creature can liue in it by rea&s;on of the vnwhole&s;omne&s;&s;e and thickne&s;&s;e of his waters: which happeneth by rea&s;on that the &s;unne, when it commeth ouer this &s;ea, draweth vp vnto it, by the force of his heat, the thinner and more &s;ubtill parts of the water which is in it, and &s;o doth leaue the thicke and more gro&s;&s;e parts be|hind, which by that meanes al&s;o become very hot and &s;alt: &s;o that no man may &s;aile vpon this &s;ea, nor any bea&s;t or liuing creature liue neere it.</HI> Item, <HI>the &s;ea</HI> Sauk, <HI>as</HI> Ari&s;totle <HI>&s;peaketh of it, which al&s;o is in the&s;e parts, and doth reach vp as high as</HI> India <HI>and the parched</HI> Zone (<HI>&s;o I thinke the word</HI> Mantakah, <HI>that is, a girdle or belt, which heere he v&s;eth, doth &s;ignifie) that there is not in it any liuing creature at all, of any &s;ort what&s;oeuer: and therefore this &s;ea is called</HI> The Dead &s;ea, <HI>becau&s;e that when&s;oeuer any worme or &s;uch like falleth into it, it mooueth no longer, but &s;wimmeth vpon the toppe of the water; and when it is dead it putrifieth and then &s;inketh and falleth to the bottome: yet when there falleth into it any &s;tinking and corrupt thing it &s;inketh immediatly and &s;wim|meth not vpon the water at all.</HI> Thus farre out of <HI>Aben I&s;aac.</HI> This &s;ea is of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> called ASPHALTITES, the lake <HI>A&s;haltites,</HI> of others <HI>A&s;phal|tes,</HI> of the <HI>bitumen</HI> which it doth yeeld in great plenty; of the Iewes, MARE PALAESTINORVM, ORIENTALE, SOLITVDINIS, <HI>&s;iue</HI> DESERTI, the <HI>Sea of Palae&s;tina,</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t Sea,</HI> the <HI>Sea of the de&s;ert</HI> or <HI>wilderne&s;&s;e,</HI> of the &s;ituation and po&s;ition of it vnto the land of <HI>Iewry: Item,</HI> MA|RE SALIS, the <HI>Salt-&s;ea,</HI> of the hot and fiti&s;h &s;altne&s;&s;e of the &s;ame, aboue other &s;alt-waters, which the Arabian iu&s;tifieth to be true: <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> that ancient and famous hi&s;torian of the Greekes: and <HI>Iu&s;tine</HI> the abridger of the large volume of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> call it MARE MORTVVM, the <HI>Dead &s;ea,</HI> of the effect: (there is &s;aith <HI>Iu&s;tine,</HI> a lake in that country, which by rea&s;on of his greatne&s;&s;e and vnmoueablene&s;&s;e of his waters, is called the <HI>Dead &s;ea,</HI> for it is neither mooued with the wind; the heauy and lumpi&s;h <HI>bitumen,</HI> which &s;wimmeth vpon the toppe of the water all the lake o|uer, re&s;i&s;ting the violence of the greate&s;t bla&s;ts: neither is it &s;aileable, for that all things that are void of life do &s;inke to the bottome: neither doth it &s;u&s;taine any thing that is not be&s;mered with <HI>bitumen</HI>) to the&s;e both my Arabians do &s;ub&s;cribe: of <HI>Galen,</HI> the Prince of Phy&s;itions, it is called LA|CVS SODOMAEVS, the <HI>Lake of Sodome:</HI> for him <HI>Nubien&s;is</HI> doth &s;tand, who neuer nameth it <HI>Bahri,</HI> a &s;ea; but <HI>Bahira,</HI> a lake or &s;tanding poole: yet contrariwi&s;e <HI>I&s;aac</HI> termeth it <HI>Bahri,</HI> not <HI>Bahira,</HI> and by this name it is generally knowen to all the Europeans. <HI>Solinus</HI> calleth it TRISTEM SINVM, the <HI>Sad-bay,</HI> like as the gulfe of <HI>Milinde</HI> is of &s;ome named ASPERVM MARE, the rough or boi&s;terous &s;ea, like as <HI>I&s;aac</HI> my authour, calleth this &s;ame lake, <HI>Tzahhib,</HI> the churli&s;h and dangerous &s;ea. <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> in the tenth chapter of his fir&s;t booke of the Antiquities of the Iewes, &s;aith, that this place where now is the <HI>Dead-&s;ea,</HI> was before named the <HI>Vale of bitumen pits.

<HEAD>A draught and &s;hadow of the ancient GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<P>_THou ha&s;t, gentle and curtuous Reader, in this Mappe a draught (a plot or patterne I might call it) of the whole world, but according to the de&s;cription &amp; ruder Geography of the more ancient authours &amp; of tho&s;e of middle age. For this our globe of the earth was not then further knowen, (a wonderfull &s;trange thing) vntill in the daies of our fathers, in the yeare 1492. <HI>Chri&s;tofer Columbus</HI> a Genoway, by the commandement of the king of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> fir&s;t di&s;couered that part of the We&s;t, which vnto this day had li|en hid &amp; vnknowen. After that, the South part hitherto not heard of, togther with the Ea&s;t part of <HI>A|&s;ia,</HI> much &s;poken of, but neuer before this time entered, was de&s;cried by the Portugals. That part which lieth toward the North, we haue &s;een in this our age to haue been fir&s;t found out by the Engli&s;h mer|chants and nauigatours; a particular view and proofe of which, thou mai&s;t &s;ee at large, in that worthy worke of the <HI>Engli&s;h Nauigations,</HI> compo&s;ed with great indu&s;trie, diligence and charge, by my &s;ingular good friend Ma&s;ter <HI>Richard Hacluyt.</HI> By him <HI>England</HI> &s;till &s;hall liue, and the name of braue Engli&s;hmen &s;hall neuer die. The o|ther countries which as yet do lie ob&s;cured within the frozen Zones and vnder both the Poles, are left for &s;ucceding ages to find out. Peraduenture, ancient writers that liued many hundred yeares &s;ince, haue named &s;ome country or &s;ome one place or other, out of this our continent; but they haue not written ought of the &s;ituation of the &s;ame, as being indeed altogether vnknowen vn|to them. In this continent and circuite, curtuous Reader, (that thou bee&s;t not caried away with a vaine and fal&s;e per&s;wa&s;ion of the knowledge of things done in the whole world) or if you plea&s;e &s;o to call it, within the compa&s;&s;e of that part of the world de&s;cribed by the old Co&s;mographers, all ancient HISTORIOGRAPHY, both SACRED and PROPHANE, is comprehended: in the&s;e all famous acts of mortall men, which from the beginning of the world euen vnto the daies of our fathers, haue been regi&s;tred by learned men, haue been done and performed. For euery &s;torie, before the forenamed <HI>Columbus,</HI> written in Latine, Greeke or any other language, exceeded not the limits of the Roman Empire, or the conque&s;ts of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, (if you &s;hall only except the tra|uels of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus</HI> by land, into <HI>China:</HI> and the nauigation of <HI>Katherino Zeni,</HI> by the ocean &s;ea, into the North parts, of which we haue &s;poken in the di&s;cour&s;e to the Mappe of <HI>Mare del zur</HI>) which I make no doubt all learned hi&s;torians and others will ea&s;ily grant me. Whereupon we may &s;ee how maimed and vnperfect the hi&s;tory of the world is, when as it is very apparant that this part of the earth then knowen, is &s;car&s;e the one quarter of the whole globe of the world that is now di&s;couered to vs. And (which is e&s;pecially to be con&s;idered, rather than to be commended) we may truly &s;ay that now, which <HI>Cicero</HI> in his third oration again&s;t <HI>Verres</HI> wrote then mo&s;t fal&s;ly: when he &s;aid of that age; <HI>There is now no place within the va&s;t ocean, none &s;o far remote and di&s;tant from vs, none &s;o ob&s;cure or hidden, whither, in the&s;e our daies, the couetous and bad minds of our men, doth not cau&s;e them go.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The ROMANE WORLD, OR The ROMANE EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_AMmianus Marcellinus</HI> thus writeth in his foureteenth booke: At &s;uch time as triumphant <HI>Rome</HI> (which &s;hall flouri&s;h as long as men do liue vpon the earth) began fir&s;t to grow into credit and honour in the world, that it might &s;till ri&s;e by degrees and lofty &s;teppes into a firme league of eternall peace, vertue and fortune (which often times iarre) did fully con&s;ent and agree. For if either of them had oppo&s;ed them&s;elues, it &s;urely had neuer come to that ab&s;olute height and greatne&s;&s;e. The people of this city from the fir&s;t infancy euen vnto the la&s;t of childhood, which was limi|ted almo&s;t within the compa&s;&s;e of three hundred yeares, abode the bitter a&s;&s;aults and warres of their neighbours round about them: then hauing growen to a &s;triplings age and pa&s;t the rodde, after many outragious furies of <HI>Mars,</HI> it pa&s;&s;ed the Alpes and narrow &s;ea. Being come to mans e&s;tate and be&s;t yeares, from all quarters of the wide world, it brought away the laurell the &s;igne of conque&s;t and triumph: but now being old and beginning to dote, and &s;ometime only bearing the name of conquerour rather than winning ought indeed, it hath betaken it &s;elfe to a more quiet kind of life. Therefore this city, reuerend for &s;o many glorious conque&s;ts of &s;tout and fierce nations, and for &s;o many good and whole&s;ome lawes which it hath enacted, hath now at la&s;t, like a kind and thrifty father, both wi&s;e and wealthy, committed her patrimo|ny and po&s;&s;e&s;sions to the Emperours, as vnto her naturall &s;onnes, to be ruled and gouerned. And lately, although the tribes and wardes be idle, the hundreds and wapentakes &s;till and qui|et, and there be no di&s;&s;en&s;ions in the Senate hou&s;e, but that the more &s;ecure and calmer times, &s;uch as <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> liued in, were come againe: yet in all parts of the world where&s;oeuer, it is regarded as a Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e and Queen, in all places the reuerend gray haires of the graue Sena|tours, euery where the very name of the Roman Nation is greatly e&s;teemed and honourable. Thus farre <HI>Ammianus.</HI> Moreouer this you &s;hall find in <HI>Sulpiciaes</HI> Satyricke poeme; Two things there are which rai&s;ed great <HI>Rome</HI> to that height, valour in warre and wi&s;dome in peace. As this Romane Empire, in the iudgement of all men, was e&s;teemed very great and large, &s;o al&s;o in|deed it was; e&s;pecially if you &s;hall compare it with tho&s;e which haue been in former ages, as that of the A&s;&s;yrians, Per&s;ians and Grecians: <HI>Item,</HI> with tho&s;e which &s;ince their fall haue &s;prong vp in their places, as namely, that of the <HI>Othomans,</HI> among&s;t the Turkes: the <HI>Sophies,</HI> among&s;t the Per&s;ians: of the great <HI>Cham,</HI> ouer the Tartars in <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> and of <HI>Pre&s;ter Iohn,</HI> as we call him, o|uer the Aethiopians or Aby&s;sines in <HI>Africa.</HI> But if you &s;hall compare it with that Monarchy which <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> within the memorie of our fathers, e&s;tabli&s;hed in di|uers parts of the world, and <HI>Philip</HI> his &s;onne in our age hath enlarged, and &s;hall by looking in|to an vniuer&s;all mappe of the Earthly globe, conferre and mea&s;ure the greatne&s;&s;e of this with tho&s;e others, by the eie you &s;hall plainly and truly di&s;cerne, that this for largene&s;&s;e may not only be preferred farre before all tho&s;e other forenamed, but al&s;o euen before that of the Ro|manes. The kingdome of the Portugals, after that by diuers nauigations they had &s;ubdued vnder their obedience the marine tracts and &s;ea coa&s;ts of Ea&s;t <HI>India,</HI> together with the ilands there about, if it did reach and were extended vp as farre within the land, as it commandeth a|bout the &s;hore, it might doubtle&s;&s;e be accounted none of the lea&s;t Empires. Seeing now there|fore that this al&s;o at this day is vnder the obedience of the &s;aid K. <HI>Philip,</HI> who doth not &s;ee that this Empire is the greate&s;t that euer was in the world?</P>
<P>Of the Empire of <HI>Rome,</HI> as it &s;tood in his daies, <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his booke <HI>De Pallio,</HI> &s;peaketh thus honourably: <HI>Reuera Orbis culti&s;simum huius Imperij rus e&s;t;</HI> that is, In very deed the whole world is nothing el&s;e but a farme well &s;tocked and &s;tored, belonging to this Empire. La&s;tly, <HI>Ouid,</HI> in his &s;econd booke <HI>De Fa&s;tis,</HI> thus writeth of it: <HI>Gentibus e&s;t aliis tellus data limite certo, Romanae &s;pacium e&s;t vrbis &amp; Orbis idem.</HI> All other nations, in the Earth their certaine bounds may name; The com|pa&s;&s;e of the World and <HI>Rome,</HI> they only are the &s;ame.</P>

<P>_IN the diui&s;ion of the world, diuers haue placed <HI>Africa</HI> in the third part: &s;ome few haue made no more but <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Eu+rope</HI> only; and <HI>Africa</HI> they make a part of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Salu&s;tius.</HI> This is that which S. <HI>Paulinus</HI> in <HI>Antonius,</HI> out o the opinion of the &s;ame <HI>Salu&s;t,</HI> thus writeth of: <HI>Europam A&s;iamqu&egrave; duo vel maxima terrae Membra, quibus Lybiam dubi&egrave; Sallu&s;tius addit, Europae admixtam: po&s;tit quum tertia dici: Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> va&s;t, the Earthly globe between them &s;hare. Yet whether <HI>Africke</HI> &s;hould a part of this our <HI>Europe</HI> be; or make a third part by it &s;elfe, <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> doth doubt I &s;ee. But <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> al&s;o in <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> doth diuide the world into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> yea <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> him&s;elfe, in his <HI>Pane|gyricos.</HI> Moreouer in <HI>Varroes</HI> booke <HI>De lingua Latina</HI> the&s;e words are read; As all the world is diuided into <HI>Heauen</HI> and <HI>Earth:</HI> &s;o <HI>Heauen</HI> is &s;euered into his quarters: and the <HI>Earth</HI> into <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> Againe the &s;ame authour in his booke of Hu&s;bandrie writeth thus: Fir&s;t, when as the world, by <HI>Erato&s;thenes,</HI> was very fuly and naturally diuided into two parts, the one toward the South, [<HI>A&s;ia</HI> doubtle&s;&s;e he meaneth] the other in the North [<HI>Europe</HI> we call it.] S. <HI>Augu|&s;tine</HI> in his <HI>16.</HI> booke <HI>De Ciuitate Dei: Lucane</HI> in his <HI>9.</HI> booke: and <HI>Oro&s;ius</HI> in the fir&s;t booke of his hi&s;tory, haue the like wordes to the &s;ame &s;en&s;e. Notwith&s;tanding cu&s;tome &s;ince hath preuailed with all Hi&s;toriographers and Co&s;mographers which haue written either in Latine or Greeke, iointly to diuide the globe of the earth into the&s;e three parts: <HI>A&s;ia, Africke</HI> and <HI>Europe:</HI> the la&s;t of which we haue taken vpon vs to de&s;cribe in this place, not only in forme of a mappe or chart, like a Geographer: but in this pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, like an hi&s;torian. Concerning the forme of it therefore, it is manifold, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth. It is a <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> or demy-ile, and not an iland; although <HI>Silenus,</HI> as <HI>Elianus</HI> writeth, did &s;ometime to <HI>Midas</HI> &s;o relate of it. For it is on all &s;ides, as you may &s;ee in the mappe, bounded and beaten with the &s;alt &s;ea, but only vpon the Ea&s;t, where it is by a &s;mall necke ioined to the greater <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Yet by what limits they are there di&s;tingui&s;hed, the ancient and the later writers do not altogether agree. For tho&s;e which are more ancient as <HI>Ari&s;totle, Plato, Herodotus,</HI> and others which do follow their opinion, do diuide <HI>Europe</HI> from <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> by the riuer <HI>Pha&s;is,</HI> (a riuer of <HI>Colchis</HI> falling into the Euxine &s;ea, <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> or <HI>Maurothala&s;&s;a,</HI> as the Greeks call it) neere <HI>Trapezonda:</HI> &s;ome mappes do now call that riuer <HI>Fa&s;&s;o,</HI> others <HI>Phaz|zeth:</HI> the Scythians, (as <HI>Theuet</HI> reporteth, <HI>Debba&s;&s;ethca</HI>) or which is all one, by that <HI>I&s;thmos</HI> or neckland which is between the fore&s;aid <HI>Mar maiore</HI> or <HI>Pontus Euxinus,</HI> and the Ca&s;pian &s;ea (<HI>Mar de Cachu,</HI> the ancient called it <HI>Mare Hyrcanum,</HI> the Hyrcane &s;ea) which formerly all old writers thought to be but a bay or gulfe of the Scythian or Northren ocean, as <HI>Strabo, Pliny, Mela, Diony&s;ius, Plutarch</HI> (in the life of <HI>Alexander</HI> and in his di&s;cour&s;e of the face in the &s;phere of the Moone) and <HI>Iornandes</HI> a more late writer, haue left recorded. Yet all of them were deceiued. Only <HI>Herodotus</HI> truly (as this our latter age doth approue and find to be &s;o) doth affirme this to be a &s;ea of it &s;elfe, and to haue neither in-let nor out-let, or to be intermedled with any other &s;ea. <HI>Diony&s;ius, Arrianus, Diodorus, Polybius, Iornandes</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey</HI> haue diuided it from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> by the riuer <HI>Tanais (Don</HI> or <HI>Tana,</HI> as now the Italians name it) who thinketh that both the ri&s;e of this riuer, and the land Northward from whence it commeth, are both vnknowen and vncertaine. All doubt where to place and lay their bounds: as indeed who neuer perfectly knew tho&s;e places toward the Ea&s;t and North, not being then di&s;couered, but only de&s;cribed by them, from the fabulous reports of others: as for example, the <HI>Riphaean</HI> and <HI>Hyperboraean</HI> mountaines, which are feined inuentions of the Greekes, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth: together with <HI>Aluani montes,</HI> heere de&s;cribed by <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> where now not only the&s;e mountaines, but al&s;o no other at this day, are to be &s;eene: but in their places diuers huge and va&s;t woods, great fennes and bogges, or large champion plaines. <HI>Orpheus</HI> al&s;o long &s;ince de&s;cribed in this part of the continent I meane, between <HI>Maeotis palus,</HI> the fenne <HI>Maeotis,</HI> (now called <HI>Mar delle Zabacche,</HI> and <HI>Mar della Tana</HI>) and the &s;ea <HI>Cronium,</HI> an huge wood. Likewi&s;e, <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer</HI> heere abouts placeth an <HI>Infinite wood,</HI> as he termeth it, from whence he &s;aith <HI>Tanais</HI> or <HI>Don</HI> doth &s;pring, which after many windings and turnings at la&s;t falleth into the forenamed fenne <HI>Maeotis. I&s;idorus</HI> heere hath the <HI>Riphaean woods,</HI> in which he &s;aith <HI>Tanais</HI> doth fir&s;t take the beginning. That <HI>Donaw (Danubius)</HI> doth diuide <HI>A&s;ia</HI> from <HI>Europe, Seneca</HI> in the &s;ixth booke <HI>Natural.</HI> doth manifestly affirme; of which his opinion, what we do thinke, we will, God willing, &s;et downe in the di&s;cour&s;e to the Mappe of <HI>Dacia.</HI> Hitherto we &s;ee the forenamed au|thours to doubt and di&s;agree between them&s;elues of the limittes of the&s;e two parts of the world: If therefore they &s;hall find me a meet vmpier and arbitratour in this matter, I would, not vnfitly, and as I hope to the liking of all parties, decide the controuer&s;ie thus: I would make the bounds, to be <HI>Tanais,</HI> or the ri|uer <HI>Don;</HI> the &s;traights or narrow peece of the maine land that is between this riuer and the riuer <HI>Rha, (Athel)</HI> which emptieth it &s;elfe into the Ca&s;pian &s;ea: the Ea&s;t branch of the &s;ame <HI>Athel:</HI> then from his head vnto the riuer <HI>Oby,</HI> and &s;o euen vnto his mouth or fall into the Northren &s;ea: For by this mouth, I do ea&s;ily per&s;wade my &s;elfe, that antiquity did verily beleeue that the Ca&s;pian &s;ea did vnlade it &s;elfe into the maine Ocean. For that the name of this riuer <HI>O|by</HI> is ancient, it is very likely, for that <HI>montes Obij,</HI> certaine mountaines called <HI>Obij</HI> are placed heereabout in this tract, by <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> which he &s;aith for|merly were called of the ancients <HI>montes Riphaei,</HI> the Riphaean hils: but then in his daies <HI>montes Alpes,</HI> the Alpes. Againe <HI>Iornandes</HI> in this continent, not farre from hence, de&s;cribeth <HI>Ouim,</HI> or <HI>Obim,</HI> a Scythian nation or family. And that the&s;e fore&s;aid mountaines, are in this place (not where <HI>Ptolemey</HI> and <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> haue placed them) very many men, of great credit and learning in the&s;e our daies, &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es do &s;toutly auouch. Amongst which <HI>Baro Herber&s;tein,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Mo&s;couy,</HI> is one: <HI>Paul Oderborne,</HI> in his treati&s;e written of the life of <HI>Ba&s;ilides,</HI> is another: la&s;tly, <HI>Antony Wied,</HI> in his mappe of <HI>Mo&s;couy</HI> may be the third. Now they name it vulgarly by diuers and &s;undrie names, but commonly they call it <HI>Cingulum mundi,</HI> The girdle of the world, as the &s;aid <HI>Herber&s;tein</HI> doth affirme. In a Mappe of the&s;e countries &s;et out by Ma&s;ter <HI>Ienkin&s;on,</HI> an Engli&s;hman, who trauelled through the&s;e parts, it is called <HI>Zona Orbis,</HI> The girdle of the Earth. Moreouer I haue in &s;ome &s;ort for this diui&s;ion, <HI>Iornandes</HI> and <HI>Aethicus,</HI> vpon my &s;ide, where they &s;ay that the Riphaean mountaines do part <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> Againe the&s;e &s;elfe &s;ame hils, yea, and in this tract, are the <HI>montes Hyperbo|rei;</HI> not where <HI>Ptolemey</HI> placeth them. And they are the &s;ame with <HI>montes Riphaei, Obij</HI> and <HI>Alpes.</HI> Thus farre of the diui&s;ion of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> from <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pliny</HI> calleth this part of the world, <HI>The Nurce of all Nations; Mardonius,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> doth tell of him, auoucheth it to <HI>Xerxes, To be by farre the beautifulle&s;t of all places of the World, to be a mo&s;t goodly and gallant country, yeelding all maner of fruites and fruitfull trees, and tho&s;e in their kindes the be&s;t; and to be &s;uch that it were pity that any king in the World &s;hould haue ought to do in but he. Varro</HI> in his bookes <HI>De re Ru&s;tica,</HI> of Hu&s;bandrie writeth, <HI>That it is a more temperate and healthfull &s;oile than</HI> A&s;ia. <HI>Statius</HI> in his <HI>Achilleidos,</HI> more than once or twice calleth it, <HI>The Mighty prouince of the World. Maxima terra viris &amp; foecundi&s;&s;ima doctis Vrbibus, Europe</HI> for multitude of warlike men and &s;cholers deeply learned, doth farre excell &mdash;: thus <HI>Mamilius</HI> writeth of it. <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> the prince of Philo&s;ophers, maketh the inhabiters of this part of the world, to be, <HI>A very &s;tout and couragious people.</HI> The &s;ame authour affirmeth, that, <HI>All kind of bea&s;ts and cattell heere, are in their kind, greater and &s;tronger than in</HI> A&s;ia <HI>and</HI> Africke. But of the nature of this country, the maners and cu&s;tomes of the people, let vs heare what <HI>Strabo</HI> that excellent Geographer &s;aith in his &s;econd booke; <HI>This part is mo&s;t fertile of valiant and prudent men. It is all generally habitable, excepting only a very &s;mall portion toward the North, and abutting vpon the</HI> Hamaxici, <HI>which dwell vpon</HI> Tanais, (Don) Maeotis palus (Mar delle Zabacche) <HI>and</HI> Bory&s;thenes (Nieper <HI>or</HI> Dne&s;ter) <HI>which place, by rea&s;on of the extream cold, is not habitable. Yet certaine bleake and mountainous places inhabited, although in re|&s;pect of the nature of the &s;oile they are tilled and manured with greater difficulty, yet hauing gotten good skilfull and indu&s;trious husbands, tho&s;e al&s;o are tamed and much bettered, which heeretofore were badly v&s;ed, and kept only by theeues and out-lawes. And indeed the Greekes when they dwelt vpon the rocks and mountaines, dwelt well and conueniently, by rea&s;on of their wi&s;e cariage in ciuill matters, arts, &s;ciences and knowledge of tho&s;e things, which nece&s;&s;arily are required to the maintenance of mans life. In like maner the Romanes, hauing brought many &s;auage and fierce Nations vnder their &s;eruile yoke, &s;eated, I meane, in places not very conuenient to dwell in, in re&s;pect of the nature of the coun|try, either for that it was rough and craggy, or wanted hauens, or was too bleake and cold, or for other cau&s;es, taught them to v&s;e merchandi&s;e before vnknowen, and haue brought them from a &s;auage and bruti&s;h life, to liue ciuilly and more humanely. But tho&s;e parts which are &s;ituate in an equall and temperat climate, there nature admini&s;treth all things nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of man and bea&s;t. Now when as tho&s;e Nations which do inhabite and dwell in fertile and rich countries, are maintainers of peace and quietne&s;&s;e; and tho&s;e which are &s;eated in barren and vn|fruitfull countries, are mo&s;t hardy and &s;tout: it commeth to pa&s;&s;e that both are helpfull one to another; while the&s;e do v&s;e their weapons for their countries defence, tho&s;e againe do help and maintaine them by the profits that they rai&s;e out of the earth, by their arts and my&s;teries, as al&s;o by their learning, wi&s;edome and policy: euen as in like maner al&s;o the dammage is mutuall and either &s;ide feeleth a &s;en&s;ible hurt, when the one part doth not helpe the other: yet the e&s;tate of the &s;ouldier and warlike man is &s;omewhat better, if they be not one come with multitude. And the nature of</HI> Europe <HI>&s;erueth very fitly for this purpo&s;e: for it is all diuer&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;hed by lofty mountaines and lowly plaines; &s;o that euery where the husbandmen and &s;ouldiers; the politicians and the martiall warriers do dwell together: yet &s;o as the greate&s;t number are peaceable men: which kind of life they enioy e&s;pecially by the meanes and labour of their captaines, fir&s;t of the Greekes, then of the Macedonians; and la&s;tly of the Romanes. Therefore both in peace and warre it is &s;ufficient of it &s;elfe to maintaine and defend it &s;elfe: for it hath great plenty both of &s;tout &s;ouldiers, painfull husbandmen, and politique &s;tate&s;men. In this al&s;o it doth excell, that it bringeth foorth pa&s;&s;ing good fruits, &s;uch I meane, as are nece&s;&s;ary for the maintenance of mans life: with all &s;orts of mettall, for what v&s;e &s;oeuer. Spices or &s;weet &s;melling things and preti|ous &s;tones, are brought hither from forren countries, WHICH THINGS VVHOSOEVER HAVE NOT, THEY LIVE NEVER A VVHIT WORSE THAN THOSE DO THAT HAVE THEM. Moreouer this is e&s;pecially worth the noting, that hauing wonderfull &s;tore of cattell, &s;heep and oxen; it breedeth very few dangerous wild bea&s;ts.</HI> Thus farre the learned <HI>Strabo.</HI> Many other things thou mai&s;t read of this <HI>Europe,</HI> together with the nature and condition of the people of the &s;ame, in that treati&s;e which <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the prince of Phi&s;itions, wrote of the care and waters. This <HI>Europe</HI> al&s;o, and not any other place of the world be&s;ide, doth yeeld <HI>Succinum</HI> or <HI>Electrum,</HI> (Amber we call it, the Germanes, <HI>Gle&s;lum</HI>) yet it is not found in <HI>Eridianas,</HI> a riuer falling into &s;ome Northren &s;ea, as <HI>Herodotus</HI> doth fabulou&s;ly report: or in <HI>Padus,</HI> a riuer of <HI>Italy (Po)</HI> as the poets ie&s;tingly af|firme: nor in the <HI>Electrides,</HI> certaine fained ilands in the Hadriaticke &s;ea, as &s;ome men of better credit, and more diligent &s;earchers out of the truth, as <HI>Pliny</HI>

<PB REF="261"> &s;aith, haue &s;eriou&s;ly thought: nor in <HI>Spaine,</HI> as <HI>Ae&s;chylus</HI> beleeued: nor in certaine rockes at the further end of the gulfe of <HI>Venice, (mare Hadriaticum)</HI> as &s;ome more &s;ober men haue giuen out: nor in <HI>Liguria,</HI> as <HI>Sudinus, Metrodorus,</HI> and <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> would haue men thinke: nor in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> neere <HI>Iu|piter Ammons</HI> temple, or in <HI>Scythia,</HI> as <HI>Philemon</HI> imagined: nor in <HI>Britaine,</HI> as <HI>Socatus:</HI> nor in the <HI>Gle&s;&s;ariae,</HI> ilands in the Germane occan, as <HI>Pliny</HI> hath taught: nor in <HI>Bannonia</HI> or <HI>Baltia,</HI> (a certain iland) as <HI>Timaeus</HI> ha h broached: nor in a certain riuer, as <HI>Dion Pru&s;aeus</HI> hath taught: but neere vnto the neckland or penin&s;ula <HI>Hae&s;tarum</HI> in the bay <HI>Pautzkerwicke</HI> and <HI>Fri&s;ch-ha&s;t, (Sinus Clilipenus)</HI> in the Balticke or Ea&s;t &s;ea, not farre from <HI>Dantzk</HI> in <HI>Pomerell</HI> or <HI>Spre&s;e:</HI> where hitherto it hath been taken (a thing wholly hidden from the ancients) to the great gaine and enriching of the Nations neere inha|biting: and not many other place of the world be&s;ide. In the &s;ame <HI>Europe</HI> are there many goodly and &s;tately cities, amongst the which the mo&s;t famous, in all ages, are <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> (which afterward was called <HI>New-Rome</HI>) and now are <HI>London, Venice</HI> and <HI>Paris.</HI> The riuers of greater note are <HI>Rhein, I&s;ther</HI> or <HI>Donaw,</HI> and the <HI>Thames:</HI> the woods more notable are <HI>Ardene</HI> in <HI>Gallia, 500.</HI> miles of length, reaching from the riuer of <HI>Rhein</HI> vn|to <HI>Tourney</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and <HI>Hercynia</HI> in <HI>Germany, 40.</HI> daies iourney long, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> writeth, and <HI>9.</HI> daies iourney broad, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his Commen|taries reporteth: a greater wood than which, or more va&s;t, there is no hi&s;tory maketh mention of. Thus much of <HI>Europe.</HI> But whereof it tooke the name and was &s;o called, or who fir&s;t gaue it that name, I thinke &s;aith <HI>Herodotius,</HI> there is no man vnder heauen doth certainly know or can vpon any probalibity ge&s;&s;e, except one &s;hould thinke it &s;o called of <HI>Europa Tyria.</HI> But wherefore it &s;hould &s;o of her be named, I am wholly ignorant, and I per&s;wade my &s;elfe and do verily beleeue, that no man in the world doth truly know. For that &s;he, as we read in the fabulous &s;tories of the poets, was violently taken out of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> a country of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and caried from thence into <HI>Cyprus,</HI> or as others write, into the iland <HI>Creta (Candy)</HI> all men do know well enough: where, as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> his Chronicle doth witne&s;&s;e, being taken of <HI>A&s;terius</HI> king of <HI>Creta</HI> to wife, &s;he bare him <HI>Minoes, Rhadamanthus</HI> and <HI>Sarpedon:</HI> from whence &s;he went not into <HI>Europe,</HI> but into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> hath left recorded. But what is that to <HI>Europe</HI> this part of the world? One might ea&s;ilier beleeue it to haue been &s;o named of <HI>Europus,</HI> who, as <HI>Trogus Pompeius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, &s;ometime in the&s;e parts po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large kingdome: which al&s;o I do &s;ee to be auouched by <HI>Eu&s;ta|thius</HI> vpon <HI>Lycophron,</HI> who maketh this <HI>Europus</HI> to be the &s;onne of one <HI>Himerus. Pau&s;anias</HI> &s;aith that one <HI>Europa</HI> was king of <HI>Sicyonia,</HI> a prouince of <HI>Peleponne&s;us</HI> in <HI>Greece:</HI> to him <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his Chronicle doth a&s;cribe, who maketh him equall to the Patriarke <HI>Abraham,</HI> &amp; to haue liued aboue <HI>3550.</HI> yeares &s;ince, about <HI>1950.</HI> yeares before the birth of Chri&s;t. There be &s;ome, as <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> writeth, that thinke it &s;o named of the <HI>beautifulne&s;&s;e and excellency of the country.</HI> The&s;e we are &s;ure are fabulous or vncertaine: may we not therefore, as they haue formed of <HI>Phrat, Euphrates,</HI> and of <HI>Koft, Aegyptus</HI> (as we haue &s;hewed before) thinke that of <HI>Riphath</HI> (the &s;onne of <HI>Gomer, Iapheths</HI> &s;onne, to whom this part of the world was pre&s;ently after the confu&s;ion at <HI>Ba|bel,</HI> a&s;&s;igned) they haue likewi&s;e formed <HI>Europa?</HI> And &s;urely the name <HI>Riphath,</HI> doth very manife&s;tly &s;hew it &s;elfe in <HI>Riphaeis montibus,</HI> the Riphean hils: item in <HI>Riphaeo fluuio,</HI> now called the riuer <HI>Oby,</HI> in <HI>Ripe,</HI> a city of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> in <HI>Rhiphataeis,</HI> the people of <HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> as <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> writeth. <HI>Pto|lemey</HI> in the &s;econd booke of his <HI>Quadripartite,</HI> in my opinion much more truly, writeth that it was &s;ometime called by a common name, <HI>CELTICA,</HI> name|ly of a principall Nation that fir&s;t did inhabite it. For there is almo&s;t no prouince in all this part, in which in time pa&s;t the <HI>CELTAE</HI> did not inhabit. For in <HI>Spaine toward the We&s;t, and beyond</HI> Hercules <HI>pillars are the</HI> Celtae as <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirmeth. <HI>Item, about the riuer</HI> Baetis, as <HI>Strabo</HI> auoucheth, <HI>the</HI> Ciltica Prae&s;amarci, <HI>are in the prouince of</HI> Lucen&s;is, <HI>and others otherwi&s;e named</HI> Nerij, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith: <HI>Dion</HI> and <HI>Xiphilinus</HI> do &s;hew that <HI>the</HI> Canta|bri <HI>and</HI> A&s;tares <HI>are the &s;ame with the</HI> Celtae: <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth the city <HI>Celtica, in the prouince</HI> Hi&s;palen&s;is. <HI>Antonius</HI> hath the <HI>Celti: item</HI> Celticum promontorium, <HI>is the &s;ame that</HI> Cantabrum promontorium, which now is called <HI>Cabo de finis terre.</HI> What Geographer or Hi&s;torian is he amongst the anci|ents that hath not made mention of the <HI>Celtebri?</HI> In <HI>France were the</HI> Celtae <HI>and</HI> Celtogalatae: and from thence are tho&s;e in <HI>Britaine.</HI> For that this iland was fir&s;t peopled from hence, lying &s;o neere ouer again&s;t it, it is a common opinion and very probable. That <HI>the Gauls Germanes were vulgarly called</HI> Celtae, all Hi&s;toriographers do iointly agree: and indeed <HI>Dion</HI> doth affirme, that <HI>the</HI> Celtae <HI>did dwell vpon either &s;ide of the riuer</HI> Rhein: <HI>the</HI> Celtae <HI>dwelt in</HI> Gal|lia Ci&s;alpina <HI>(Lombardy)</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Appianus</HI> writeth. And againe <HI>vpon the Ionian &s;ea,</HI> (that is, the <HI>Hadriaticke</HI>) which al&s;o <HI>Strabo</HI> doth auerre. <HI>Silius Italicus</HI> placeth them <HI>about the riuer Eridianus (Po). In Epirus &s;ometime dwelled the Celtae,</HI> as <HI>Antonius Liberalis</HI> hath giuen out: <HI>Stepha|nus</HI> placeth the &s;ame <HI>about the mount</HI> Haemus: Arrianus, <HI>neere the mouth of the riuer</HI> Donaw: as al&s;o <HI>Strabo</HI> in <HI>Moe&s;ia.</HI> The &s;ame authour writeth, that <HI>the Celtae are intermedled with the Illyrij and Thraces.</HI> Who al&s;o placeth them <HI>vpon the riuer</HI> Bory&s;thenes. Moreouer Ari&s;totle in his booke De mundo, <HI>ioineth the Celtae with the Scythians.</HI> Heere hence the &s;ame Strabo and Plutarch do make their <HI>Celto&s;cythae.</HI> In Plutarch, in the life of Camil|lus, I read that <HI>the Galatae</HI> (which he maketh to haue come of the &s;tocke of the Celtae) <HI>pa&s;&s;ing the Northren &s;ea came vnto the Riphaean mountaines.</HI> Againe out of the forenamed Strabo I learne that <HI>the Nations dwelling Northward were in his time called Caltae.</HI> The which al&s;o their ancient lan|guage, which is called the <HI>Celticke or Germane tongue,</HI> doth at this day &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate: which is the &s;ame (only differing a little in dialect) with that <HI>which is v&s;ed in the ilands neere adioining</HI> to the&s;e places, as in I&s;land, Groenland, Frie&s;land and others in this ocean. Plutarke in Marius wri|teth, that <HI>Celtica doth begin at the outmo&s;t &s;ea</HI> (that is, the Atlanticke &s;ea) <HI>and &s;o &s;tretcheth it &s;elfe out farre into the North and from thence vn|to the fenne Maeoris,</HI> (Mare delle Zabacche.) Pomponius Mela calleth <HI>the Ca&s;&s;iterides</HI> (which in another place we haue proued to belong to great Britaine, or to be of the number of tho&s;e which are named Brittanicae) <HI>Celticke Ilands.</HI> What is this el&s;e, I pray you, than plainly to affirme that <HI>THE CELTAE DO POSSESSE ALL EVROPE?</HI> Which indeed is that which <HI>Ephorus</HI> in <HI>Strabo</HI> did &s;ee &s;o many yeares &s;ince: when as he diuiding all the world into <HI>4.</HI> quar|ters, &s;aith that, <HI>That part which is toward the Ea&s;t, is inhabited of the</HI> Indians: <HI>that which is in the South, of the</HI> Aethiopians: <HI>the North parts, of the</HI> Scythians: <HI>and the We&s;t, of the</HI> Celtae. The &s;cholia&s;t of Appollonius nameth <HI>the Hadriaticke &s;ea, Mare Celticum,</HI> the Celticke &s;ea. And Lyco|phron de&s;cribeth <HI>Celtos, a certaine poole, about the mouth of the riuer I&s;ter.</HI> Item he placeth <HI>Leuce an iland of Mar maiore</HI> (Pontus Euxinus) <HI>o|uer again&s;t the mouth of the riuer Donaw.</HI> May we not therefore properly, as they call tho&s;e that inhabit A&s;ia, A&s;ians: and tho&s;e which dwell in Africa, Africanes: call the&s;e which dwell in Celtica, Celtickes? He that out of all ancient &s;tories, penned either in Latine or Greeke doth not know that the Celtae are the Germanes, let him haue recour&s;e to the <HI>22.</HI> chapter of Hadrianus Iunius his Batauia, and I doubt not but, hauing throughly waied tho&s;e many &s;ound ar|guments, and &s;ufficient te&s;timonies of ancient graue writers, &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied and &s;weare to our opinion. If not, let him li&s;ten to the Dutchmen, and he &s;hall heare them call one another in their familiar communication, <HI>Kelt.</HI> The French al&s;o or Gauls I call a German nation. And I can proue by good arguments, if it were a matter pertaining to this our purpo&s;e, that the Germane or Dutch tongue is the ancient language of the <HI>Celtae,</HI> and to be the &s;ame which hitherto they haue v&s;ed in all places and now is &s;poken, except in &s;ome places where the power of the Romanes &s;o preuailed, that they bani&s;hed this, and &s;eated theirs in the roome. It is likely therefore that the etymology and rea&s;on of the deriuation of the word <HI>Europe,</HI> which was vnknowen vnto the old writers, is to be &s;ought and fetched from no other language el&s;e, but from that which was mo&s;t v&s;uall in this part of the world. For that the inhabitants of any country &s;hould take the name of their natiue &s;oile from &s;trangers, it is &s;o ab&s;urd and hard to be beleeued, that there cannot any thing more fooli&s;h or contrary to truth be inuen|ted or deui&s;ed. Wherefore I thinke it good, concerning this matter, heere to lay downe the iudgement of <HI>Goropius Becanus,</HI> our countryman, who thinketh it to be &s;o named, not of a woman, (which it is probable, either neuer was, or neuer came heere) but <HI>&agrave; latitudine videndi,</HI> of the largene&s;&s;e of his pro&s;pect (as he &s;peaketh) namely, becau&s;e (I do cite his owne words out of the <HI>9.</HI> booke of his <HI>Origines</HI>) it doth not only looke toward A&s;ia, on the Ea&s;t and South: Africa, on the South and We&s;t: but al&s;o the New-found-world beyond the Hyperborei, on the We&s;t and North. Neither &s;hall any man per&s;wade me, that <HI>Europe</HI> had the name from <HI>Greece</HI> or the Greeke language, &s;eeing that it was fir&s;t inhabited of the Cimbers (<HI>Cimmerij,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>Gomer,</HI> the elder brother) before it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Greeks (<HI>Iones,</HI> come from <HI>Iawan</HI> a yonger brother, &amp; but the <HI>4.</HI> &s;on of <HI>Yapheth</HI>) we make a dipthong by &s;etting the <HI>5.</HI> vowel of the Latins before the <HI>2.</HI> which neither the Latins nor Greeks do admit. Therefore if &s;o be at any time they would change the words in which this did light, for <HI>We,</HI> they put <HI>Eu;</HI> turning it backward. Therefore our men do term it <HI>Verop,</HI> not <HI>Europ,</HI> whereby they vnder&s;tand a worthy <HI>company of men:</HI> for <HI>Wer</HI> (a mono-&s;yllable pronounced like a dipthong) &s;ignifieth <HI>lo&s;ty, great, excellent &amp; that which is be&s;t in euery kind of thing:</HI> which notwith&s;tanding &s;ome do write <HI>ur,</HI> without a dipthong, yet with a long vowell. Therefore, as of <HI>Terues,</HI> they formed <HI>Tereus,</HI> &s;o of <HI>Werop,</HI> the Latines &amp; Greeks haue made <HI>Europe:</HI> &s;o named of the excellency of the Nation, which doth farre &s;urpa&s;&s;e all other men of the World. For <HI>Hop,</HI> as I haue &s;hewed before, &s;ignifieth a company or multitude of men. More of this word thou mai&s;t &s;ee in his <HI>8.</HI> booke Thus farre out of his workes which are foorth in print: that which followeth, is taken out of a booke of his which he al&s;o hath &s;et foorth, yet not imprinted, but &s;uch as he v&s;ed priuatly, and hath many additions in &s;undrie places in the margin written with his owne hand, which he had prepared again&s;t the &s;econd edition. But I waighing, &s;aith he, and comparing this name with that which I haue read in holy Scripture, a|nother rea&s;on farre more excellent, and better commeth into my mind. We &s;ee that to <HI>Yaphet</HI> was promi&s;ed enlargement or a farre &s;preading of his po&s;terity, or as &s;ome other interpret the word, ioy and gladne&s;&s;e: which then he truly had enioied, when as Chri&s;t had redeemed vs by his death and pretious bloud (which ble&s;&s;ing doth agree to this part of the world, rather than to any other vnder heauen be&s;ide: and therefore all other countries generall do call <HI>Europe: THE KINGDOME OF THE CHRISTIANS:</HI> and the Europeans, are called of the Turkes and Arabians, <HI>GIAVVR,</HI> that is, Chri&s;tians.) <HI>E,</HI> therefore doth &s;ignifie a lawfull contract and mariage: <HI>VR,</HI> excellent: and <HI>HOP,</HI> hope: whereupon it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ignifieth <HI>The excellent hope of a lawfull mariage.</HI> which is proper to this portion of the world which <HI>Noah</HI> gaue to <HI>Iapheth</HI> his &s;onne to inhabite. For although that the po&s;terity of <HI>Sem</HI> was by <HI>Abraham,</HI> for many ages wedded to God, yet at length he put her away and diuorced her from him. But the wedlocke whereby God, by Chri&s;t is wed|ded to <HI>Europe</HI> his Church, &s;hall neuer be di&s;&s;olued: &s;o that <HI>Europe</HI> may mo&s;t properly be &s;aid to be <HI>Iaphets</HI> portion. But of this word we will &s;peake more in our <HI>Francica.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Goropius.</HI> Which I haue very willingly communicated to the curtuous Reader, leauing it to the cen&s;ure of the learned to be iud|ged. Yet I know that the&s;e things haue been very bitterly skoffed at already by a certaine learned man, but one wholly ignorant of this tongue, and therefore of le&s;&s;e iudgement in this argument. There are &s;ome which do thinke that this <HI>Europe</HI> was in the holy Scripture called <HI>IAPETIA.</HI> Thus farre of <HI>Europe,</HI> to which before I do altogether leaue, I will ad out of <HI>Herodotus</HI> in his <HI>Polymnia,</HI> the words of <HI>Mardonius</HI> to <HI>Darius</HI> &s;poken of this country. <HI>That it is a country mo&s;t goodly and beautifull, bearing all maner of excellent fruitefull trees, and tho&s;e in their kind the be&s;t: and to be &s;uch that it were pi|ty that any man but a king only &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The BRITISH ILES, Now, THE EMPIRE OF <HI>Great Britaine.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>_PLiny</HI> &s;aith that in the Atlanticke ocean, there be many ilands named <HI>BRITANNICAE INSVLAE, The Briti&s;h ilands;</HI> but the two greater <HI>ALBION</HI> and <HI>HIBERNIA, (Ireland)</HI> are properly &s;o called. Of the&s;e, <HI>ALBION,</HI> in regard that it is both the greate&s;t, and as it were commander of the re&s;t, is mo&s;t properly called <HI>BRITANNIA.</HI> And I might ea&s;ily be drawen to beleeue, that all the&s;e ilands were recorded in the ancient monuments of the Greekes, before they were once named or knowen to the Romanes; and to haue generally been called <HI>CASSITERIDES,</HI> as who &s;ay, <HI>The Stannaries,</HI> and that properly <HI>CASSITERA,</HI> which the Romans call <HI>Britannia.</HI> And although I am not ignorant, that <HI>Ca&s;&s;itera</HI> is held of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Stephanus</HI> to be <HI>Indica In&s;ula,</HI> an Indi|an an iland, or, an iland belonging or neere adioining to <HI>India,</HI> yet I am not a whitte moued from that my opinion. For I do verily thinke that this was deliuered by them rather of ignorance, than of &s;ound knowledge grounded vpon the skill of Geography: and we know that this is al&s;o a common errour in the&s;e our daies, to call all countries and ilands vnknowen or farre remote and di&s;tant from vs, <HI>Indian iles;</HI> by which name, not without a manife&s;t ignorance of the truth, they call all that whole continent of the <HI>New world,</HI> together with the circumiacent ilands fir&s;t di&s;couered and found out in the daies of our grandfathers; and &s;uch al&s;o as daily are de&s;cried, they call by that name. On my &s;ide is <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> a man out of all doubt, of good iudgement and credit, who calleth them <HI>CELTICAS, Celtickeiles;</HI> as if they were neere neighbours to the <HI>Celtae.</HI> I do know that the&s;e <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides,</HI> are of others otherwi&s;e de&s;cribed; as of <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> a little aboue <HI>Lu&s;itania (Portu|gall)</HI> of <HI>Pliny,</HI> oueragain&s;t <HI>Celtiberia, (Valentia)</HI> neere <HI>Artabrum promontorium (cabo de finis terrae)</HI> by <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey:</HI> where now there are no ilands at all; (and therefore not the&s;e) nor euer were any: whereupon it is apparant that the&s;e ilands were rather known to the ancients by name, than true &s;ituation. Now all men do iointly commend the&s;e ilands for the great abundance of <HI>Tinne</HI> and <HI>Lead,</HI> which they yearely did yeeld: <HI>Strabo</HI> al&s;o maketh the&s;e ilands rich in <HI>Hides</HI> or Leather. Do not then the&s;e three, who&s;e plentifull &s;tore, hath made <HI>ENGLAND</HI> at this day &s;o famous all the world ouer, manife&s;tly proue that they all pointed and aimed at <HI>Britaine?</HI> For what country or prouince is there in the whole globe of the Earth, that is &s;o rich in <HI>Pelts</HI> and <HI>Leather:</HI> or hath &s;uch plenty of fine wooll, as <HI>ENGLAND</HI> hath? The &s;ame <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth, that in the <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides</HI> they digge not very deep for mettals. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith that they are found in the very &s;ourd of the earth. That the&s;e do &s;peake both of the &s;ame thing, who doth not &s;ee? By the&s;e I gather, That the Phoenicians in times pa&s;t, and Spaniards, did for trafficke &s;aile through the &s;traights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> vnto this iland; and for Tinne, Lead and Pelts bring in for exchange Bra&s;en ve&s;&s;els and Salt: like as afterward the Romanes, when <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> had &s;ubdued it, v&s;ed to do the next way ouer land by <HI>France.</HI> Therefore it was then fir&s;t knowen to the Romanes, by the name of <HI>Britannia,</HI> which before that, certaine ages pa&s;&s;ed, was very famous amongst the Phoenicians by the name of <HI>Ca&s;&s;itera. Appianus</HI> a reuerend authour, who liued about the time of <HI>Hadrian</HI> the Emperour, writeth that the Spaniards did forbeare to trauell vpon the We&s;t and North ocean, but when they were forced into <HI>Britaine,</HI> by the violence of the tide. That heere he nameth <HI>Britaine, Ca&s;&s;itera,</HI> I make no que&s;tion: but that name was then worne out of v&s;e, and this, as I thinke it very likely, was growen in request and better knowne. Let the learned &s;ee, and at their better lei&s;ure con&s;ider, whether that <HI>Sextus Rufus Auienus</HI> doth not de&s;cribe the&s;e ilands vnder the name of <HI>OESTRYMNIDVM?</HI> Surely I am of that opinion he doth. For he &s;aith that the&s;e <HI>Oe&s;trymniades,</HI> are very rich of lead and tinne: and that the country people do make &s;hippes of Leather, in which they &s;aile vpon the maine &s;ea. What is this el&s;e then that which <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, That the Britanes do go to &s;ea in &s;hippes made of wickers and couered ouer with raw hides? and doth not <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his fir&s;t booke <HI>de Bello ciuili,</HI> affirme that the Britans did v&s;e to make the keele and ribbes of their &s;hips of &s;ome light wood, the other part being radled with o&s;iers or roddes was couered with leather? This iland the Romanes, as <HI>Dion</HI> and <HI>Xiphiline</HI> do te&s;tifie, diui|ded into the <HI>HIGHER,</HI> containing all that part which is toward the South: and the <HI>LOVVER,</HI> toward the North. In the Almage&s;t of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> this is called <HI>MINOR, The Le&s;&s;er:</HI> and that <HI>MAIOR, The Greater:</HI> and that about the time of <HI>Seuerus</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome.</HI> But in the raigne of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Em|perour, I find in <HI>Sextus Rufus,</HI> that it was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the&s;e names, <HI>BRITANNIA PRIMA,</HI> The Fir&s;t, <HI>BRITANNIA SECVNDA,</HI> The Second, <HI>BRITANNIA MAXIMA,</HI> The Greater, <HI>CAESARIENSIS</HI> and <HI>FLAVIA.</HI> The booke of Remembrances <HI>(Notiar)</HI> and <HI>Ammianus</HI> do adde <HI>VALEN|TIA;</HI> which others, as <HI>Oro&s;ius, Claudian</HI> and <HI>Hege&s;ippus</HI> call <HI>SCOTIA, Scotland. Xiphilinus</HI> in <HI>Seuerus</HI> referreth the people generally to the&s;e two nations, <HI>MAEATAI</HI> and <HI>CALEDONII:</HI> for the names of the re&s;t may, as he &s;aith, welnigh be reduced to the&s;e two. (Yet this mu&s;t needes be fal&s;e except he meane it par|ticularly of <HI>Valentia,</HI> the later part.) He that de&s;ireth to know the &s;euerall Nations of this iland as then it was inhabited, let him haue recour&s;e to <HI>Ptolemeys</HI> Geo|graphy, and this our Mappe, into which we haue packed tho&s;e things which we haue gathered heere and there di&s;per&s;ed in <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> Commentaries, <HI>Tacitus, Pau&s;ani|as</HI> and <HI>Ammianus;</HI> and he &s;halbe &s;atisfied to the full. But wilt not thou be deceiued? take the learned M. <HI>Camden</HI> for thy guide: and then I will warrant thy &s;afe conduct. Thus farre of the names of the&s;e ilands: now let vs &s;peake in like manner of the iles them&s;elues, and fir&s;t of the greatest of them which we &s;aid was called <HI>Britannia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> vnto <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great writeth, <HI>That this ile for greatne&s;&s;e doth exceed the re&s;t. Tacitus</HI> te&s;tifieth, <HI>That it is the greate&s;t of all ilands that the Romanes euer had notice of.</HI> It is &s;o great, as <HI>Appian</HI> writeth, that it might &s;eeme to be <HI>ANOTHER CONTINENT.</HI> And <HI>Hege&s;ippus</HI> calleth it <HI>A|NOTHER WORLD. Cae&s;ar, Diodorus, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> do make it to be <HI>Three cornered:</HI> and &s;o it may a&s;well as <HI>Sicilia</HI> be called <HI>TRINACRIA. Taci|tus</HI> out of <HI>Liuy</HI> and <HI>Fabius Ru&s;ticus</HI> do liken it to a <HI>Swingling &s;tocke,</HI> or the warlike weapon <HI>Bipennis,</HI> a twall, or battle-axe. <HI>Iornandes</HI> &s;aith, It is fa&s;hioned like a <HI>Conus,</HI> that is, to a Geometricall body, which like a taper, is broad at the bottome and &s;harpe at the toppe. <HI>Nubien&s;is</HI> the Arabian, who wrote about fiue or &s;ix hundred yeares &s;ince, likeneth it to <HI>the head and necke of</HI> Alnaama, <HI>an o&s;trich.</HI> This Iland was fir&s;t de&s;cried and made knowen to the Romane Empire in the time of <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar</HI> the tyrant, <HI>who fir&s;t of all men</HI> (I vnder&s;tand it of the Romans) <HI>entered it with a thou&s;and &s;aile of &s;hippes,</HI> as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> in his &s;ixth booke hath left re|corded. For <HI>before that,</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> in his <HI>39.</HI> booke te&s;tifieth, <HI>whether there were &s;uch an iland or not, it was vncertaine.</HI> The later writers made a doubt whether it were a part of the maine land, or an ile apart by it &s;elfe: and of this argument they haue written much on both &s;ides, who indeed knew nothing for certaine of it (them|&s;elues hauing neuer &s;een it, or learned by the inhabitants what it was) but only by ge&s;&s;e had written of it coniecturally, as euery one had more lea&s;ure or learning. In pro|ce&s;&s;e of time, fir&s;t when <HI>Agricola</HI> was vice-praetor (which I vnder&s;tand by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> was vnder <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI>) then againe, in our daies, &s;aith <HI>Dion,</HI> vnder <HI>Seuerus,</HI> it was manife&s;tly found to be but an iland, and not of the Continent. Before the comming of the&s;e men, the iland had neuer borne the yoke of any forren Prince, as <HI>Dio|dorus Siculus</HI> teacheth. It was gouerned by many princes: the common people for the mo&s;t part bore the &s;way and had a kind of &s;oueraignty, as we learne out of <HI>Cae|&s;ar, Strabo, Xiphiline,</HI> and <HI>Tacitus:</HI> who al&s;o moreouer doth adde, that by their princes they are drawne to many factions and taking of contrary parts: and that they neuer haue any common coun&s;ell for the &s;tate of the whole common-wealth: &s;o that while they fight &s;euerally, they are &s;euerally conquered. <HI>The temperature of the aire,</HI> &s;aith Cae&s;ar, <HI>is more mild than in</HI> France, <HI>the fro&s;ts and cold are not &s;o eger. Tacitus</HI> affirmeth, That heere is neuer any bitter cold weather. <HI>Stra|bo</HI> writeth, that the aire is rather &s;ubiect to clowdes than &s;now. <HI>Herodian</HI> teacheth, that the aire is thicke and foggie: and he thinketh the rea&s;on, to be the heat and vapours which do a&s;cend vp out of the fennes and mar&s;hes. In <HI>Britaine,</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Minutius Felix,</HI> the diuine) the heat of the Sunne is not great, but it is comforted and hartened by a warme and hot &s;treame of the &s;ea, which inuironeth it on euery &s;ide. The &s;ame forenamed <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith, that the mo&s;t part of the iland is plaine and cham|pion, be&s;et with woods and groues: to haue al&s;o &s;ome earthy hils, but very craggie, and drie without water, as <HI>Xiphiline</HI> writeth: moreouer &s;ome plaines, de&s;ert and full of fennes and bogges. This la&s;t <HI>Herodian</HI> auoucheth to be true, who &s;aith that by rea&s;on of the frequent ouerflowing of the &s;ea, it is fenny and moori&s;h in diuers pla|ces. Notwith&s;tanding the <HI>Panegyricus</HI> maketh it a very fertile and fruitfull &s;oile for <HI>Corne;</HI> yet it is better for gra&s;&s;e than corne, and is more kind to bea&s;t than man, as <HI>Mela</HI> affirmeth: and therefore heere is infinite &s;tore of cattell, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> hath left recorded. Yet it beareth <HI>Wheat</HI> and <HI>Rie,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> te&s;tifieth, and that by the meanes of their great &s;tore of marle: for this, <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, doth a&s;&s;ure the Britans of greater fertility: which in the time of the Emperour <HI>Iulian,</HI> was &s;o luxurious and &s;uperabundant, that as <HI>Marcelline</HI> in his eighteenth booke iu&s;tifieth, they haue &s;ent ouer corne and proui&s;ion into <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Germany.</HI> The &s;ame hi&s;tory <HI>Zozimus</HI> doth approue. It yeeldeth all maner of commodities other things as <HI>France</HI> doth, (excepting the <HI>beech</HI> and <HI>firre</HI> tree) yea Hares, Hennes and Gee&s;e, as the forenamed <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> doth te&s;tifie. <HI>Xiphiline</HI> out of <HI>Dion</HI> doth highly coommend it for wonderfull &s;tore of all &s;orts of <HI>Fi&s;h: Solinus</HI> as much for the great variety and plen|ty of <HI>Mettals.</HI> All the world did euer admire it for the infinite abundance of <HI>Tinne</HI> and <HI>Lead.</HI> E&s;pecially vp higher within the country, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> would haue it. Who&s;e opinion <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in a maner doth gaine&s;ay: who affirmeth that mettals are plentifully found in <HI>Cornewall,</HI> neere the promontory which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> called, <HI>Antiue&s;taeum</HI> and <HI>Bolerium:</HI> the &s;ame <HI>Diodorus, Belerium: Nubien&s;is Tarfi'lgarbey mina'lgiezira;</HI> The outmo&s;t bound of the iland toward the We&s;t: or as our &s;eamen call it, <HI>The lands end,</HI> and <HI>The cape of Cornewall.</HI> Be&s;ide the&s;e mettals, the &s;ame authour &s;aith, that it yeeldeth al&s;o <HI>Iron,</HI> but not in any great quan|tity, and that in like maner toward the &s;ea coa&s;t. <HI>Item, Pliny</HI> doth te&s;tifie, that it affoordeth <HI>Lead</HI> in great abundance euen in the vpper &s;ourd of the earth. It hath al&s;o &s;ome veines of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Siluer,</HI> if we will beleeue <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> two authours of good credit. <HI>Item,</HI> the prophecies of <HI>Sibylla</HI> do auouch it to be rich in Gold: peraduenture, &s;aith <HI>Ortelius,</HI> in re&s;pect of that plenty that is brought in thither: for <HI>Cicero</HI> vnto <HI>Trebatius</HI> writeth, that the ile of it &s;elfe doth not yeeld one dramme of Gold or &s;iluer: and that nothing is to be caried from thence, nor any maner of booty to be expected, more than that which may ari&s;e of &s;laues. But <HI>Cicero</HI> heere &s;pake like a lawyer, not like a Philo&s;opher, and louer of the truth. For our hi&s;tories do approue that there haue been mines, of both tho&s;e mettals informer a|ges, found both in <HI>England, Wales</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> and the like no doubt we now might find, if we would &s;eeke for them with the like diligence. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> do write that heere are many and great riuers which do affoord both pearle and pretious &s;tones. The&s;e pearles are the be&s;t in value and e&s;timation, next to tho&s;e of <HI>In|dia,</HI> in the iudgement of <HI>Aelianus:</HI> the hope and gaine of the&s;e. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, fir&s;t moued <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> to a&s;&s;ault this iland. <HI>Heliodorus</HI> doth highlie commend the <HI>Ame|thy&s;t</HI> of <HI>England.</HI> I read in <HI>Solinus</HI> that heere are hot baths (<HI>fontes calidi,</HI> Bathe, I vnder&s;tand) very curiou&s;ly carued and trimmed for the v&s;e of man: the&s;e

Heere al&s;o is the <HI>Agath (gagares)</HI> the be&s;t in his kind, as <HI>Solinus</HI> and the old interpreter of <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> do iointly te&s;tifie. <HI>Pliny,</HI> many yeares &s;ince, it &s;eemeth had heard of our <HI>Engli&s;h Outers:</HI> which one commended who thus wrote of them; &mdash; <HI>Rutupinoqu&egrave; edita fundo, O&s;trea callebat primo deprehendere mor&s;u.</HI> The Poet <HI>Gratius</HI> doth highly commend the <HI>Engli&s;h Dogges,</HI> which are tran&s;ported from hence, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, for the excellent quality which naturally they haue for their &s;ure hunting: which al&s;o <HI>Neme&s;ianus</HI> was not ignorant of, when he thus wrote of them, &mdash; <HI>Diui&s;a Britannia mittit Veloces, no&s;tri&abque; Orbis venatibus aptos. Britaine</HI> that <HI>Other World,</HI> hath alwaies borne the name, For &s;wifte&s;t hounds, and be&s;t for hunters game. <HI>Symma|chus</HI> writeth vnto <HI>Flauianus</HI> his brother, that in time pa&s;t the Romanes did greatly admire the Engli&s;h dogges: and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth that the Gauls did v&s;e their helpe in the warres. There is a kind of the&s;e which are le&s;&s;e than the common &s;ort, which I find de&s;cribed in <HI>Oppianus</HI> his booke of hunting: <HI>Aga&s;&s;ae|us,</HI> he calleth it, a beagle, or ga&s;e-hound: See M. <HI>Camdens Britannia.</HI> Whether in former times it hath had wine or not (for <HI>Tacitus</HI> flatly denieth that it will beare vines or oliue trees) I dare not affirme: yet I vnder&s;tand by <HI>Vopi&s;cus,</HI> that <HI>Aurelianus</HI> the Emperour did &s;uffer the Britans to plant vines, and to make wine. <HI>Item,</HI> the <HI>Panegyricus,</HI> an oration made to <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, doth atttribute to this ile &s;o great a fertility of corne and all &s;orts of graine, that it hath &s;ufficient both bread corne and drinke corne to maintaine it &s;elfe. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth that <HI>Sotacus</HI> verily beleeued that Amber <HI>(Electrum)</HI> heere dropped out of certaine trees, which they therefore called <HI>Electrides,</HI> amber trees, a feigned &s;tory inuented by the old writers: as al&s;o this perhaps which <HI>Clemens</HI> in the &s;ixth booke of his <HI>Stromaton,</HI> writeth from the relation of <HI>Heruetus:</HI> they which write hi&s;tories, do report that in <HI>Britannia (Britannice,</HI> the Greeke copy hath) there is a certaine caue vnderneath an hill, in who&s;e roppe is a chincke or rift: when the wind driueth into the caue, and beateth a|gain&s;t the &s;ides of is, there is heard a &s;ound, as it were of cymbals making a melodious harmony. Like as that of <HI>Solinus</HI> al&s;o is, who writeth, that there is an altar <HI>(ara)</HI> in a by-place, or odde corner in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> a part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which by the in&s;cription written in Greeke letters, doth manife&s;tly &s;hew that <HI>V|ly&s;&s;es</HI> had landed there to performe &s;ome vow that he had made. And whether euer this ile were ioined to the maine continent or not, as <HI>Seruius</HI> is per&s;wa|ded I dare not affirme. Now it remaineth that we in like maner do &s;peake &s;omething of the people of the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> do giue out that it is wonderfull populous: But from whence the people and fir&s;t inhabitants came, whether they were home|borne <HI>(indigenae)</HI> or come from other countries, it is not knowen as <HI>Tacitus</HI> hath written. The inner partes, higher within the land, are inhabited of tho&s;e which they &s;ay, were borne and bred there: the &s;ea coa&s;ts are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e which came thither from <HI>Belgium</HI> (the Low countries) all of them almo&s;t are called by the names of tho&s;e cities and prouinces from whence they came, and where they were bred, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> reporteth. This his opinion <HI>Ptolemey</HI> doth con|firme, who in this ile al&s;o doth name and de&s;cribe the <HI>Belgae</HI> and <HI>Attrebates. Tacitus</HI> auoucheth that in that the <HI>Caledonij,</HI> (a people in <HI>Scotland</HI>) are red haired and bigge limmed, it is a manife&s;t argument that they are come of the &s;tocke of the <HI>Germaines.</HI> Their well coloured complections, curled heads, and country oppo&s;ite to the coa&s;t of <HI>Spaine,</HI> do proue that the ancient <HI>Iberi,</HI> in former times had cro&s;&s;ed the &s;ea and &s;eated them&s;elues heere. That the <HI>Galli</HI> or <HI>Gauls</HI> did enter vpon tho&s;e coa&s;ts neere to their country, it is very probable by their ceremonies, &s;uper&s;titious opinions, and &s;imilitude of languages. <HI>Zozi|mus</HI> in his fir&s;t booke writeth that the Emperour <HI>Probus,</HI> &s;ent into this iland all the <HI>Burgundians</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> that he could &s;uppre&s;&s;e and take aliue, that heere they might dwell and &s;eat them&s;elues. The <HI>Saxons</HI> and other nations which entered this land, I do of purpo&s;e omit: becau&s;e the&s;e were of later times and but the other day: we only determined to touch tho&s;e things that were of greater antiquity. Generally the inhabitants of this ile, in tho&s;e daies, were all vnciuill and rude: and as they were more farther remote from the maine continent, &s;o they had le&s;&s;e knowledge of forren wealth and were le&s;&s;e de&s;irous of the &s;ame. <HI>That the Britans were more valiant and hardy than the Gauls,</HI> we learne out of Tacitus: <HI>that they were more taller of &s;tature than they,</HI> Stra|bo doth affirme: <HI>That they v&s;ed &s;trangers di&s;curteou&s;ly,</HI> Horace reporteth: <HI>Claudianus</HI> the poet nameth this ile <HI>&s;aeua Britannia,</HI> tyrannous <HI>Britaine.</HI> And the &s;ame authour in his <HI>Panegyricus,</HI> for the Con&s;ul&s;hip of <HI>Honorius,</HI> calleth the people <HI>&s;aeuos Britannos,</HI> cruell Britans. <HI>Quid</HI> in his &s;econd book of Loue, nameth them <HI>virides Britannos,</HI> the green Britans: in the fifteenth booke of his Metamorpho&s;is, <HI>Aequoreos Britannos,</HI> the Britans of the &s;ea. They weare their haire long, all their body in what part &s;oeuer being &s;hauen, be&s;ide their head and vpper lippe. The &s;ame authour &s;aith that for nature and quality they are for the mo&s;t part all alike, yet &s;ome are more plaine and &s;imply minded, others more rude and barbarous: &s;o that although they haue great &s;tore of milke, yet they know not how to make chee&s;e: others are wholly ignorant of &s;owing, planting, grafting and of &s;uch other points of hu&s;bandrie. In their cari|age and conuer&s;ation they are, as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;peaketh of them, plaine, &s;imple and vpright, farre remote from the wily &s;ubtillies and crafty deuices of our men which liue more neere the Court. They fare ba&s;ely and feed vpon gro&s;&s;e meats, and are wholly e&s;tranged from wealth and gorgeous life and mainte|tenance: and as <HI>Mela</HI> &s;aith of them, they are only rich in cattell, and great lands and compa&s;&s;e of ground. For they do not hold it lawfull to eat either hare, henne or goo&s;e: notwith&s;tanding they keepe them, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> writeth, for game and pa&s;time. Yet they haue a kind of gee&s;e heere, which they call <HI>chenerotes, (bernacles)</HI> which they e&s;teeme for great dainties, &s;o that in <HI>England</HI> they haue not a daintier di&s;h, as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth. They feed vpon milke and fle&s;h meat, as the &s;ame authour &s;aith. They lay their corne vp in their barnes in the eare of &s;heaffe vnthra&s;hed: from whence they fetch and thra&s;h as much as &s;hall &s;erue them from day to day. Of their temperate and &s;paring diet, together with their patience in aduer&s;ity and affliction, <HI>Dion</HI> in the life of <HI>Nero</HI> will teach thee. That they did make their drinke, which they called <HI>Curmi,</HI> (or as now they pronounce it <HI>Courow,</HI> ale) of barley, <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> that famous phy&s;ition, or in|du&s;trious and painfull &s;tudent and &s;earcher out of the true nature of medicinall &s;imples, &s;o many hundred yeeres, hath left recorded. <HI>Zonaras</HI> writeth that they did v&s;e to make a kind of meat, of which if any man &s;hould take but the quantity of a beane, he &s;hould neither be an hungred or a thir&s;t for a great time. Beleeue him that li&s;t. Of the &s;ame Britaines, <HI>Herodian</HI> thus writeth: they weare no kind of garment: onely about their neckes they cla&s;pe a piece of iron, thinking that to bee as great a iewell and &s;igne of wealth, as other barbarous nations do by gold. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aith that they be clad in skins and leather. They v&s;ed to haue tenne or twelue wiues common amongst a certaine company of them: e&s;pecially brothers with brothers and fathers with their &s;onnes were thus co-partners: but if any of them were gotten with child, who&s;oeuer got it, it was accounted to be his who fir&s;t maried her when &s;he was a maide. Thus <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his time wrote of them. That many of them had but one wife onely, <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his &s;euenth booke <HI>de Praepar. euangel.</HI> hath giuen vs to vnder&s;tand: which al|&s;o <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> in his <HI>9</HI> booke <HI>Recognitionum,</HI> doth auerre. <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;aith that they do ordinarily liue till they be an hundred and twenty yeares old. They v&s;e bra&s;en money or iron rings made of a certaine weight and poi&s;e, in &s;teed of gold or &s;iluer coines. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith that they v&s;ed to weare rings vpon their middle finger. In <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> I read, that their hou&s;es did &s;tand thicke and clo&s;e together: but as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, they were for the mo&s;t part made of reeds, or timber. They dwell in woodes like as we do in cities. For they call that a towne, when they haue with a banke or ditch enclo&s;ed or fortified a comber&s;ome wood, whither they may flocke and re&s;ort, to auoid the inua&s;ion and a&s;&s;ault of their enemies: as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his commentaries doth giue vs to vnder&s;tand: and there, as <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith they make cabbines or cottages for them&s;elues, and &s;tables for cattle, &s;uch as may &s;erue them for that pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. <HI>Herodian</HI> cal|leth them a very warlike and bloudy nation. They fight not only on hor&s;ebacke and foote, but al&s;o with coches and waggons, armed after the maner of the Gauls; <HI>Couinos</HI> they call them, who&s;e axeltrees or linces were armed with hookes made &s;omewhat like to the Welch bils now adaies v&s;ed, as <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> affirmeth; they v&s;e likewi&s;e in their warres a great multitude of waines, as <HI>Cae&s;ar, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> do tell vs. They fight with huge great &s;words, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ignifieth: the&s;e &s;words, <HI>Herodian</HI> &s;aith, hang clo&s;e downe by their bare skinne: only &s;heathed in a &s;treight peece of leather. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> writeth that they v&s;ed to adorne the pommels of their &s;words with the teeth of certaine &s;ea fi&s;h. They know not what a brigandine, iacke or head-peece meane: the&s;e peeces of armour they neuer v&s;e, accounting them to be but a trouble and hinderance to them when they are to pa&s;&s;e ouer any bogges or fennes. For they v&s;e to &s;wimme, runne through or to wade vp to the twi&s;t ouer tho&s;e fennes and mari&s;hes, and many times being bare-legged they &s;pare neither thicke nor thinne: yet afterward we learne out of <HI>Dion</HI> by the oration of <HI>Bunduica,</HI> their queen, that they were wont to arme them&s;elues, for defence with helmets, habergions and greaus: when they gaue the on-&s;et vpon their enemies the &s;ame authour teacheth vs, they v&s;ed to make a great noi&s;e and to &s;ing terrible and threatning &s;ongs. They make warre manie times vpon &s;mall occa&s;ions and for wantonne&s;&s;e: and very often they inuade and annoy one another of &s;et purpo&s;e; e&s;peciallie for a de&s;ire of further command and couetou&s;ne&s;&s;e of enlarging their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. <HI>Tacitus</HI> moreouer affirmeth, that they al&s;o go in the field vnder the leading and conduct of women: for a manife&s;t proofe of which he bringeth in (in the foureteenth booke of his Annals) <HI>Boudicea</HI> with her daughters. <HI>Dion</HI> affirmeth the &s;ame: but he calleth her <HI>Bunduica: item Tacitus.</HI> in the life of <HI>Iulius Agricola,</HI> writeth her name <HI>Voadica. Corpora inficiunt vltr&ograve;;</HI> they purpo&s;edly &s;taine and paint their bodies: (there is a very learned man who thinketh that for <HI>vltr&ograve;,</HI> heere &s;hould be read <HI>nitro:</HI> with &s;altpeter) but wherefore or to what end they did it, that is vncertaine: <HI>Mela</HI> and <HI>Iornandes</HI> do thinke they did it for ornament and to &s;et out them&s;elues: or that they might &s;eeme more terrible vnto their enemies in time of &s;ight, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;aith: who ouermore addeth that they thus paint their bodies with wood (<HI>Luteum,</HI> he calleth it) which will make a blew or skie-colour. Others heere for <HI>Luteum,</HI> do read <HI>Gla&s;tum:</HI> on who&s;e &s;ide <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;eemeth to &s;peake, but that he affirmeth this only of the women: where he writeth that the Britans wiues and women did v&s;e to be&s;mere all their body ouer with <HI>gla&s;tum,</HI> (woad, an hearb like plantaine) and to go &s;tarke naked to &s;ome certaine &s;olemnities, when they were to performe &s;ome rites and ceremonies: in this imitating the Blackamoores. (But why I &s;hould not reteine the ancient reading, which in <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> was <HI>gla&s;to:</HI> for that which now they would haue <HI>luteo;</HI> I &s;ee no rea&s;on: &s;eeing that out of a fr gment of a de|&s;cription of <HI>Britaine,</HI> done by my good friend M. <HI>Humfrey Lhoyd,</HI> I vnder&s;tand, that amongst the We&s;t Britans in the ancient Britti&s;h tongue, which they &s;till &s;peake euen to this very day, by the word <HI>glas,</HI> they vnder&s;tand the blew or skie-colour, as al&s;o by the &s;ame they &s;ignifie the hearb <HI>I&s;atis,</HI> th t is, woad) which is very like the plantaine.) And that the men al&s;o did not onlie &s;taine their bodies with &s;ome kind of colour, but al&s;o to marke them with diuers kinds of pictures, and counterfeits of &s;undrie &s;orts of liuing creatures, and to go naked, lea&s;t they &s;hould hide this their painting, I read in <HI>Herodian.</HI> Li&s;ten, thou &s;halt heare <HI>Solinus</HI> &s;peake the &s;ame wordes: The countrie is partly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a barbarous and wild people, which euen from their childhood, haue by certaine cutters, men skilfull that way, diuers images and pictures of liuing creatures, drawen and rai&s;ed vpon their skinne, and &s;o imprinted in their fle&s;h, that as they
<PB REF="263"> grow vnto mans e&s;tate the&s;e pictures together with the painters &s;taines, do wax bigger and bigger: neither doth the wild people endure any thing more patient|ly and willingly, than that their limbes by meanes of tho&s;e deep cuts and &s;la&s;hes, may &s;o deepely drinke in the&s;e coloures, that they may &s;ticke long by them. A|mongst the Godde&s;&s;es, as I learne by <HI>Dion,</HI> they wor&s;hipped <HI>Andates;</HI> (for &s;o they call <HI>Victoriam,</HI> victory) who had a temple and &s;acred wood, where they v&s;ed to do &s;acrifice, and performe their religious &s;eruice and wor&s;hip to her.

Fro~ them, doubtle&s;&s;e, this nation had their knowledge of the &s;tate &amp; immor|tality of the &s;oule after this life: for this was the opinion of tho&s;e <HI>Druides,</HI> as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and others haue written of them. But of the <HI>Druides,</HI> we will, God willing, &s;peake more in our <HI>Old France,</HI> or <HI>Gallia</HI> as it &s;tood in <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> time. That the Britans did &s;o greatly e&s;teeme and wonderfully extoll the art Magicke, and performe it with &s;uch &s;trange ceremonies, that it is to be thought that the Per&s;ians had it from hence, I haue <HI>Pliny</HI> for my patron, who mightily per&s;wadeth me. The forenamed <HI>Bunduica,</HI> al&s;o doth &s;eeme to iu&s;tifie the &s;ame: who, as &s;oone as &s;he had ended her oration vnto her army, ca&s;t an hare out of her lappe, by that meanes to ge&s;&s;e what the i&s;&s;ue of that iourney would be: which after that &s;he was ob&s;erued to goe on forward, all the company iointly gaue a ioifull &s;hout and ac|clamation. To &s;acrifice and offer the blood of their captiues vpon their altars, and to &s;eeke to know the will and plea&s;ure of their Gods by the entrails of men, as the Romans did by the bowels of bea&s;ts, the&s;e people held it for a very lawfull thing.

The latter writers, as S. <HI>I&s;idore,</HI> and the reue|rend <HI>Beda,</HI> our countriman, call it <HI>SCOTIA,</HI> of the <HI>Scottes</HI> which &s;eated them&s;elues in the We&s;t part of this ile, about the yeare of our Lord <HI>310.</HI> from whence within a very few yeares after, being called in by the Picts, they came into <HI>Brittane:</HI> and indeed <HI>Paulus Oro&s;ius, Beda</HI> and <HI>Egeinhardus,</HI> authors of good credit, wrote that it was inhabited of the <HI>Scots.</HI> It is in length from South to North <HI>400.</HI> miles; in breadth &s;car&s;e <HI>200.</HI> The &s;oile and temperature of the aire, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> affirmeth, is not much vnlike that of <HI>England.</HI> It breedeth no &s;nake or &s;erpent, nor any venemous creature: fowle and birds heere are not very plentifull, and as for bees, no man euer &s;aw one in the whole country: yea if &s;o be that any man &s;hall &s;trew du&s;t, grauell or &s;mall &s;tones brought from hence, amongst the hiues, the &s;warmes will pre&s;ently for&s;ake their combes, as <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth. (Yet we know by experience that this is all fal&s;e: for &s;uch is the in|finit number of bees in this country, that they are not only to be found heere in hiues and bee-gardens, but al&s;o abroad in the fields in hollow trees and holes of the ground.) The temperature of the aire (&s;aith <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI>) is very vnkind and vnfit for the ripening of corne and graine: but the &s;oile is &s;o good for gra&s;&s;e, not only great and ranke, but al&s;o &s;weet and whole&s;ome, that their heards and cattell do fill them&s;elues in &s;o &s;hort a time, that if they be not driuen out of the pa&s;ture, they will feed while they bur&s;t. <HI>Solinus</HI> affirmeth the &s;ame, but in fewer words. Furthermore he calleth it an inhumane and vnciuill country, by rea&s;on of the rude and har&s;h manners of the inhabitants. And <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> termeth the people a di&s;ordered and vnmannerly nation, le&s;&s;e acquainted with any &s;ort of vertue then any other people what&s;oeuer: yet they may in &s;ome re&s;pect be &s;aid to be louers of vertue: in regard that they are very religious and deuout. <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith, that they are more ru&s;ticall and vnciuill then the Britans: <HI>Solinus</HI> calleth it a mercile&s;&s;e and warlike nation: <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that they are great eaters: <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;aith, they did v&s;e to eat mans fle&s;h: and <HI>Solinus</HI> he addeth, that tho&s;e which are conquerers in warre, v&s;e fir&s;t to drinke the bloud of tho&s;e which are &s;laine, and then with the &s;ame to be&s;mere their face. Yea they do account it, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, for a commendable thing to eat the bodies of their parents when they be dead: and to lie men and women with one another openly, not regarding who &s;tand and looke on: and that not only with o|ther women, but al&s;o euen with their mothers, and owne &s;i&s;ters: accounting this for an indifferent thing, neither good nor bad, as <HI>Iulius Solinus Polyhi&s;tor</HI> writeth. Moreouer he affirmeth, that if a great bellied woman &s;halbe brought to bed of a &s;onne, &s;he cau&s;eth the fir&s;t meat which he eateth to be laid vpon his fathers &s;word, and &s;o vpon the point of the &s;word &s;he gently putteth it into the infants mouth: and with certaine heatheni&s;h vowes and praiers, &s;he wi&s;heth that he may neuer die but in the warres or vpon his enemies &s;word. They which would be more finer and gallant than others, do &s;et out the handles and pommels of their &s;words with the teeth of certain &s;ea-fi&s;h: for they are as white as any iuory: and the chief: delight of the men is in the brauery of their weapons. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his Chronicle &s;aith, that in this Iland <HI>Galba</HI> cau&s;ed him&s;elfe to be proclaimed Emperour: but it is a fault of the writer, who for <HI>Hiberia,</HI> wrote <HI>Hibernia:</HI> for that this was done in <HI>Spaine.</HI> Thus farre of the&s;e two greater Ilands, which were properly called <HI>Britannicae:</HI> now let vs go on with tho&s;e which are le&s;|&s;er, and do lie about the coa&s;t of the&s;e.</P>

It is very neere the coa&s;t of <HI>Britaine,</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> &s;aith: yea &s;o neere that from the main, by &s;wimming ouer the flattes and &s;hallow places, <HI>Iulius Agricola,</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, conueied in thither both hor&s;emen and foot|men, to &s;uppre&s;&s;e certaine rebels that held it again&s;t the Romans. But of this iland there is in this our Theater, a whole di&s;cour&s;e written by <HI>Humfrey Lloyd,</HI> a learned gentleman, &amp; painfull &s;tudent in the Briti&s;h &s;tories. Vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>Wales</HI> al&s;o lieth <HI>BERDSEY,</HI> that is, <HI>The birds Ile,</HI> called of the Britans <HI>Enhly:</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey, Edry;</HI> of <HI>Pliny, Andros</HI> or <HI>Adros:</HI> a plaine and champion country toward the We&s;t, but in the Ea&s;t very hillie and mountainous. Then <HI>GRES|HOLME,</HI> and <HI>STOCHOLME</HI> excellent pa&s;torage, pa&s;&s;ing plea&s;ant by rea&s;on of the &s;weet &s;mell of the wild Tyme which heere groweth euery where in great abun|dance. Next to the&s;e is <HI>SCALMEY,</HI> as fertile as any, called of <HI>Pliny, Silimnus:</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey, Limi:</HI> and in the catalogue of Martyrs, <HI>Lemeneia In&s;ula.</HI> In the mouth of <HI>Seuern,</HI> lie the <HI>Holmes,</HI> or as the Welchmen call them, the <HI>Echni, FLATHOLME</HI> and <HI>STEEPHOLME (Reoric,</HI> in Welch) <HI>Item, BARREY, SILEY, CALDEY</HI> and <HI>LONDEY,</HI> &s;mall Ilands, but very fertile. Thirty or forty miles off We&s;t from the Cape of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> which the &s;eamen commonly call, The lands end, lie the <HI>SORLINGS</HI> or the <HI>SYLLY;</HI> called by <HI>Sulpitius Seuerus, Sillinae;</HI> of <HI>Antonine, Sigdeles:</HI> of <HI>Solinus, Silurae,</HI> or <HI>Silurum In&s;ulae:</HI> the Grecians, of their &s;ituation, named them <HI>He&s;perides,</HI> the We&s;t iles: and of their rich commoditie of Tinne <HI>(Ca&s;&s;iteros)</HI> which they yeeld, <HI>Ca&s;&s;iterides,</HI> the Stanneries: but why <HI>Fe&s;tus Auianus</HI> &s;hould name them <HI>O&s;trimnides,</HI> I know not. They are in all <HI>145.</HI> be&s;ide craggie rockes which are innumerable. There are <HI>10.</HI> of them, which al&s;o <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> doth te&s;tifie: <HI>S. Mary, Annoth, Agnes, Samp&s;on, Silly, Brefer, Ru&s;co,</HI> (or <HI>Tri&s;craw) S. Hellen, S. Martine</HI> and <HI>Arthur,</HI> with <HI>Minanwitham,</HI> and <HI>Minui&s;i&s;and,</HI> greater and more famous then the re&s;t for their rich veines of Tinne: from whence, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Medacritus</HI> fir&s;t brought <HI>Lead</HI> or <HI>Tinne</HI> into <HI>Greece.</HI> Many of them are good <HI>corne ground:</HI> all of them infinite &s;tore of <HI>Conies, Cranes, Swannes, Herons,</HI> and other <HI>Sea-fowle.</HI> The&s;e are tho&s;e ilands as <HI>Solinus</HI> writeth which a tempe&s;tuous frith, of two or three houres &s;aile ouer, doth part from the outmo&s;t end of <HI>Corn|wall (Danmoniorum ora)</HI> who&s;e inhabitants doe &s;till ob&s;erue the ancient cu&s;tomes: they keepe no faires or markets: they care not for mony: they giue and receiue &s;uch as one another haue neede of: they rather regard more to get nece&s;&s;ary things for exchange, than tho&s;e of high price and great valew: they are ve|ry deuout in their religious &s;eruices to their Gods: and both women and men in like manner do hold them&s;elues to be very skilfull in foretelling of things to come.</P>
<P>Vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> ouer again&s;t <HI>Normandy,</HI> are <HI>GERSEY (Cae&s;area, Antoninus</HI> calleth it) a fertile &s;oile, good corne ground, and rea&s;onable pa&s;torage: it hath <HI>12.</HI> pari&s;hes, wel inhabited and very populous: <HI>Item, GARNSEY, SERKE, ALDERNEY, ARME,</HI> the <HI>QVASQVETS</HI> and others, which although the ancients did neuer reckon amongst the number of the Britti&s;h iles, yet we know that they are now &s;ubiect to the crowne of <HI>England,</HI> and euer haue beene &s;ince the yere of our Lord <HI>1108.</HI> at what time they were by <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, annexed to this kingdome. They are all in the dioce&s;&s;e and iuri&s;diction of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Clo&s;e to the &s;hore of <HI>England</HI> is the ile of <HI>WIGHT, (Ptolemey</HI> calleth it <HI>Wicte&s;is; Pliny</HI> &amp; <HI>Suetonius, Vectis;</HI> the <HI>Panegyricus</HI> &amp; <HI>Eutropius, Vecta; Diodorus, Icta,</HI> all deriued from the Britti&s;h word <HI>Guith,</HI> which &s;ignifieth a deui&s;ion, or &s;eparation; for that it was once ioined, as then they vulgarly held, vnto the maine land: like as <HI>Sicilia</HI> was to <HI>Italy.</HI>) It is <HI>20.</HI> miles long, &amp; <HI>12.</HI> miles broad. <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> fir&s;t brought it vnder the obedience of the Romans, in the raigne of the emperor <HI>Claudius,</HI> as <HI>Suetonius</HI> writeth in the fourth chapter of his <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ianus:</HI> yet <HI>Eutropius</HI> affirmeth it to be done by <HI>Maximianus</HI> the emperor. It is by the &s;ea, which entreth vp high within the land, diuided into two prouinces: <HI>Fre&s;h-water ile</HI> and <HI>Binbridge ile.</HI> In <HI>Bedaes</HI> time it conteined but <HI>1200.</HI> families, now it hath <HI>36.</HI> pari&s;hes, villages &amp; ca&s;tles, which do belong all to <HI>Hant&s;hire,</HI> and are of the dioce&s;&s;e <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> The &s;oile is very fertile either for corne or cattel. Be&s;ide many flocks of &s;heep of pa&s;&s;ing fine wool, it is wonderfully &s;tored with <HI>Conies, Hares, Patridges</HI> &amp; <HI>Phe&s;ants.</HI> In the time of <HI>William</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>William Fitz-osbern</HI> was intituled <HI>Lord of Wight,</HI> and after that <HI>Henry Beauchamp</HI> Earle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> was by King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, crowned <HI>King of Wight.</HI> See more of it in <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> and <HI>Beda.</HI></P>
<P>The ile <HI>TENET,</HI> lying hard to the coa&s;t of <HI>Kent,</HI> of eight miles length, &amp; fower miles breadth, is a chalkie &s;oile, and pa&s;&s;ing good corne ground. <HI>Solinus</HI> calleth it <HI>Thanatos,</HI> or as &s;ome copies haue, <HI>Athanatos,</HI> &amp; thus he writeth of it: The ile <HI>Thanatos (Tenit)</HI> wa&s;hed by the French ocean: &amp; di&s;ioined from <HI>England,</HI> the main continent, by a narrow frith, is a very rich corne ground &amp; fat &s;oile: neither is it only good and kind to it &s;elfe, but al&s;o to other places: for as in it no &s;nake or venemous &s;erpents do breed or liue, &s;o the earth &amp; du&s;t, caried from thence, to what place of the world &s;oeuer, doth naturally kill &s;uch vermine: Thus far <HI>Soli|nus</HI> then: but that which he &s;pake of it concerning Serpents, we now in our daies know by experience to be fal&s;e. Neere to this is that &s;hallow &s;andy place, &s;o dangerous to &s;ea-men, commonly called <HI>GOODVVINS SANDS,</HI> an iland &s;ometime the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Earle <HI>Goodwin,</HI> which as our hi&s;tories report, did &s;inke in the yeere of our Lord <HI>1097.</HI> This &s;hould &s;eeme to be <HI>Toliapis,</HI> of <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> but that he placeth it neere to E&s;&s;ex or the <HI>Trinobantes,</HI> when as this lieth a great deale more neere the <HI>Cantij.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Thames mouth are yet other two ilands, one vpon Kent &s;ide, which now we call <HI>SHEPEY,</HI> that is, <HI>the ile of &s;heep,</HI> but how it was called of the an|cients we certainly know not: The other vpon E&s;&s;ex &s;ide, which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in his time called <HI>CAVNA, CONVENNOS</HI> or <HI>COVNOS</HI> (&s;uch is the variety of copies) is &s;till called <HI>Conway.</HI> It lieth &s;o flat and low that it is &s;ometime all ouerflowen, excepting &s;ome little knols and hils whither the cattle do ordinarily flie in &s;uch like danger. It feedeth yerely four thou&s;and &s;heepe at the lea&s;t, who&s;e fle&s;h is of a mo&s;t &s;weet and plea&s;ant ta&s;te &s;urpa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of other places. Thus hauing pa&s;|&s;ed &s;o many trouble&s;ome and dangerous &s;eas, and now being come within kenning of mine owne natiue country, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to put into harbrough heere for awhile, to re&s;t our wearied limmes, and purge vs from tho&s;e bracki&s;h humours which in this tedious iourney we drunke in. Thus farre then of the ilands de&s;cribed and named in this Mappe. Yet there are certaine others mentioned in &s;ome authours of good note. And <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the life of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> giueth out, that there are many ilands neere to <HI>Britain,</HI> wa&s;te and de&s;ert: whereof &s;ome, he &s;aith, are dedicated to the gods and famous worthies. Amongst the&s;e there is one, in which he &s;aith, they report, <HI>Saturne</HI> lulled a &s;leepe by <HI>Briareus,</HI> is kept as pri&s;oner in chaines: he is bound, I &s;ay, with &s;leep in &s;ted of a chaine: and hath many Angels and demy-gods for &s;eruants to wait and attend vpon him. Whether this be that which that <HI>Auienus</HI> calleth <HI>Pelagia,</HI> and affirmeth to be con&s;e|crated to <HI>Saturne,</HI> I dare neither con&s;tantly affirme, nor peremptorily deny. Moreouer, of the&s;e &s;ame thou mai&s;t read &s;omething worth the while as not altoge|ther vnplea&s;ant, though doubtle&s;&s;e meerly fabulous, in the &s;ame <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his booke intituled <HI>De defectu Oraculorum,</HI> of the cea&s;ing of oracles: as al&s;o in <HI>I&s;acius Tzetzes,</HI> vpon <HI>Lycophron. Artimedorus</HI> in <HI>Straboes</HI> Geography &s;aith, that there is an iland neere <HI>Britaine,</HI> where they offer &s;acrifice to <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> in the &s;elfe &s;ame manner and with like ceremonies, as they do in <HI>Samothrace. Apollonius,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of &s;trange and wonderfull things, affir|meth out of <HI>Cytinus Chius,</HI> that there is a certaine Britti&s;h ile (not <HI>Britaine</HI> it &s;elfe, as <HI>M. Camden</HI> vnder&s;tandeth him) <HI>400.</HI> furlongs in compa&s;&s;e, where fruits doe grow without &s;tones or kernels: for you &s;hall neither find a &s;tone in the oliue, nor kirnell in the grape: which al&s;o happeneth not only to the&s;e <HI>2</HI> fruites, but al&s;o to all other of tho&s;e kinds. But this is more like a feigned tale, then a true &s;tory. Moreouer <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer</HI> nameth the <HI>NESIADES,</HI> the &s;eat and ha|bitation of the <HI>Ammitae,</HI> among&s;t the number of the Britti&s;h iles: but I would rather iudge the&s;e to be ilands vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> than Britti&s;h iles, and that by the authority of <HI>Strabo.</HI> If any man do de&s;ire to know the&s;e better, let him repaire to the learned <HI>Claurencieux Camden,</HI> my &s;ingular good friend, who hath in that his <HI>Britannia,</HI> (a worthy worke compo&s;ed by him, with infinte paines and trauell) &s;o learnedly and diligently de&s;cribed and &s;et downe their anci|ent forme, cu&s;tomes, maners, places and cities, together with tho&s;e of later times, and of the&s;e our daies, that they rather &s;eeme to be expre&s;&s;ed to the eie in their true colours, by the pencill of a skilfull painter, then by the pen of a painfull &s;tudent. But &s;ome man may &s;ay, this is written in the Latine tongue, a language that I vnder&s;tand not. Be patient a while. Thou &s;halt heare him &s;peake &s;hortly good <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Of mine owne knowledge he is already put to &s;choole, for that purpo&s;e into the country to the learned <HI>Philemon Holland.</HI> If thou knowe&s;t him not: that learned Doctor of Phy&s;icke, who lately taught the great Philo&s;o|pher <HI>Pliny</HI> of <HI>Como;</HI> &amp; the renowmed Hi&s;torian, great <HI>Liuy</HI> of <HI>Padua;</HI> two Italians that neuer could &s;ound a word of ours before, to &s;peake Engli&s;h &s;o plainly and well, as neuer none better. No &s;tranger, nay no man, euer &s;pake more properly, none more eloquently. When he beginneth (I know it will not be long) we ruder clownes, will hold our peace. But we cannot forget the worthy paines of the learned <HI>M. Ver&s;tegan,</HI> who hath giuen vs good cau&s;e to remember him with thanks, for that his <HI>Re&s;titution of decaied intelligence,</HI> in antiquities concerning the renowmed Engli&s;h Nation, lately imprinted and dedicated to his mo&s;t exellent Maie&s;ty.</P>

<HEAD>SPAINE.</HEAD>
<P>_THis is that warlike Spain, famous I mean, for worthy men &amp; braue &s;ouldiers, as Florus &s;peaketh of it, the fir&s;t country of the maine continent of Europe vpon the We&s;t, inuironed round about with the &s;alt &s;ea, but only on that part where it bor|dereth vpon France, from which it is &s;euered by the Pyreney mountaines, as it were by a naturall wall or rampart. Some there are which do thinke that it was fir&s;t called <HI>IBERIA;</HI> of the riuer <HI>Iberus,</HI> or, as others would haue it of a king of this country of that name. Auienus deemeth it to haue beene &s;o named of <HI>Ibera,</HI> (of which you may read in Liuy) a city of the prouince Betica, &s;ituate vpon the riuer <HI>Iberus,</HI> different from that other of the &s;ame name in Hi&s;pania Tarraco|nen&s;is. But I could more ea&s;ily be drawen to thinke that both this country and the riuer did take their name of <HI>Iberia,</HI> a country in A&s;ia, from whence this people fir&s;t came and had their originall, where al&s;o there is a riuer called <HI>Iberus,</HI> as Pliny te&s;tifieth. That it was al&s;o called <HI>HESPERIA,</HI> of king <HI>He&s;perus,</HI> be&s;ide the great Poet Virgil, Honorius and the faigned Bero&s;us, farre latter writers, would faine make me beleeue. But truth will ea&s;ily enforce any wi&s;e man to be|leeue, that it rather tooke that name of <HI>He&s;perus,</HI> which in Greeke &s;ignifieth the We&s;t, or the Euening &s;tare: for indeed Spaine, of all the maineland of the whole world, as farre as the auncients knew, lieth farthe&s;t into the We&s;t. And therupon Horace nameth it <HI>He&s;peria vltima,</HI> The farther He&s;peria, to make a di&s;tinction betweene this and that other He&s;peria, I meane Italie, which Virgil calleth <HI>He&s;peria magna,</HI> The great He&s;peria. For as the Greeks haue called this country He&s;peria, by rea&s;on of the &s;ituation, being indeed from them We&s;tward, &s;o the Italians for the &s;ame cau&s;e haue intituled Spaine, which lieth betweene them and the We&s;t, by the &s;ame name. But at la&s;t it was generally of all &s;orts of writers in both languages famou&s;ed by the name of <HI>HISPANIA,</HI> and that of one <HI>Hi&s;panus,</HI> except Trogus Pompeius be deceiued. Whether it hath &s;ometime beene called <HI>PANNONIA,</HI> as Stephanus, in his booke of cities, hath giuen out, I am not able to &s;ay. That it was once knowen by the name of <HI>PANIA,</HI> it &s;ee|meth to be probable out of the fir&s;t chapter of the third booke of Pliny his Naturall hi&s;tory. Where he &s;aith that <HI>Lu&s;a</HI> gaue the name and appellation to that part of Spaine which was called <HI>Lu&s;itania:</HI> (now Portugall) and <HI>Pan,</HI> who was &s;ometime gouernour of that country, cau&s;ed the whole to be denominated after his name. Of this opinion al&s;o is So&s;thenes, cited by Plutarch, in his third booke of the hi&s;torie of Iberia; where he writeth that this country of Pan, was fir&s;t named Pania, but afterward of &s;uccedent ages it was corruptly called <HI>SPANIA.</HI> S. Hierome, vpon the &s;ixtie and fourth chapter of the Prophet E&s;ay calleth it Spania, and that the Chaldaeans did call it <HI>Spamia,</HI> (peraduenture for Spania) Benedictus Arias Montanus, a man worthy of eternall fame, in his Commentaries vpon Obadiah, doth plainly te&s;tifie. And &s;ome there are, which, in the <HI>28.</HI> ver&s;e of the fifteenth chapter of Saint Paul vnto the Romanes, for <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, do read <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, as you may &s;ee by the edition of Henry Steeuen, and the Syrian copie which Raphalengius v&s;ed: although &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions of Plantine, and that of Albert Widman&s;tade haue the contrary. For <HI>Hi&s;pania,</HI> as commonly it is read in the printed copies of Trogus, in the manu&s;cripts I do find <HI>Spania.</HI> And &s;o the be&s;t and mo&s;t ancient copies of Quintus Curtius haue, as the &s;ingular learned Bongar&s;ius hath noted. Thus al&s;o the name of this country was alwaies wont to be written aboue &s;euen hundred yeares &s;ince, as the worthy gentleman Ambro&s;ius Moralis, a man of great credit, and a mo&s;t diligent &s;earcher out of Spani&s;h antiquities, in more then one or two places in his Commentaries vpon the Eulogium, doth teach vs. An ancient Glo&s;&s;ary vpon the Poet Iunenall &s;aith, that <HI>Tagus e&s;t fluuius Spaniae,</HI> that is, Tagus is a riuer of Spaine. In an ancient Greeke Lexicon &s;et out by Henry Steeuen, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, is put for <HI>Hibera,</HI> and <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, for <HI>Hi&s;pania.</HI> Galen, the prince of Phy&s;icians in the fourth chapter of his &s;ixth booke of Simples, writeth that there is an oile brought out of Iberia <HI>(Spaine)</HI> called amongst the Apothecaries <HI>Oleum Spanum, i. Hi&s;panum,</HI> that is, Spani&s;h oile. In a little manu&s;cript treati&s;e of the Prouinces belonging to the Romane Empire, I found <HI>Spania,</HI> in that very place where Schonhouius, who fir&s;t &s;et this booke out in Print, hath <HI>Hi&s;pania.</HI> The inhabitants of this country, which to this day do name it <HI>E&s;pan~a,</HI> or <HI>Spania,</HI> do confirme this writing. For E&s;pan~a and Spania do differ only in maner of writing, not in &s;ound or pronunciation. For the Spaniards v&s;ually do put E before any Latine words which do begin with S, and &s;o make the Spani&s;h. Examples heereof thou mai&s;t find in our The&s;aurus, at the word <HI>Iberia.</HI> Moreouer it was &s;ometime called <HI>CELTIBERIA,</HI> as Appian and others do te&s;tifie. Heerehence it is that the people of this country were anciently called <HI>Celtiberi</HI> and <HI>Celto&s;cythae,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Iglerae,</HI> as Strabo the worthy Geographer hath left recorded. Of the Iewes it is called <HI>SEPHARAD,</HI> as the forenamed Montanus, and William Po&s;tell do teach vs. But of the name and appellation let this &s;uffice: it remaineth now that in like maner we &s;peake &s;omewhat of the countrie it &s;elfe. Di|ony&s;ius Afer and Strabo do affirme that this country is in forme like vnto an Ox hide: Trogus &s;aith that it is &s;quare: Aethicus, an authour of &s;mall cre|dit, in my iudgement, maketh it Three-cornered. In the decree of Con&s;tantine, which Io&s;eph Scaliger hath &s;et out with Au&s;onius, it is graced with the title of <HI>Specio&s;a,</HI> The beautifull. Stephanus diuideth it into the <HI>GREATER,</HI> and the <HI>LESSER.</HI> And an ancient in&s;cription maketh mention of Spaine the <HI>LOVVER (Inferior.)</HI> Learned antiquity did diuide it into <HI>CITERIOREM</HI> and <HI>VLTERIOREM,</HI> or <HI>EXTERIOREM,</HI> The Hi|ther and the Further or Outter Spaine. Since that certaine yeares, it was di&s;tingui&s;hed into three prouinces, called by other different names. For that which they called Citerior, was by them named <HI>TARRACONENSIS;</HI> that part of the Vlterior which lieth We&s;tward, <HI>LVSITANIA;</HI> and the o|ther which declineth toward the South, <HI>BAETICA.</HI> Afterward in the time of the Romane Emperours it was diuided into &s;ix &s;hires or prouinces, who&s;e names out of Sextus Rufus are the&s;e: <HI>TARRACONENSIS, CARTHAGINENSIS, LVSITANIA, GALLICIA, BAETICA,</HI> and <HI>TRANSFRETANA,</HI> which otherwi&s;e al&s;o they called <HI>TINGITANA.</HI> Yet the Mappe &s;heweth that this latter prouince is no part of true Spaine, but a portion of Africa, beyond the &s;treights. Moreouer to the&s;e the booke of Records addeth <HI>INSVLAREM</HI> or <HI>Balearium,</HI> The Baleares, Malorca and Menorca with other ilands in the Mediterran &s;ea, belonging to this country. All Spaine, thus generally defined, was by the Romanes diuided into four|teen Iuri&s;dictions <HI>(conuentus iuridici;)</HI> For in Lu&s;itania Pliny teacheth vs that there were three, to wit, <HI>EMERITENSIS, PACENSIS,</HI> and <HI>SCALABITANVS,</HI> and in them were fiue and forty townes: In Tarraconen&s;is or Hither Spaine, there were the&s;e &s;euen, <HI>CARTHAGINENSIS, TARRACONENSIS, CAESAR AVGVSTANVS, CLVNIENSIS, ASTVRVS, LVCENSIS,</HI> and <HI>BRACARVS:</HI> in which there were <HI>294.</HI> townes. In Batica were the&s;e foure, <HI>GADITANVS, CORDVBENSIS, ASTIGITANVS</HI> and <HI>HISPALENSIS,</HI> and in them <HI>175.</HI> townes. So that the whole &s;umme of all the townes in Spaine is <HI>514.</HI> And although Strabo doth &s;eeme to make the number &s;omewhat greater, yet hee thinketh that they do but cog, which &s;ay that in Spaine there be more then a thou&s;and: and that they do account great villages for good townes: and with|all he affirmeth that the country is not capable of many cities, by rea&s;on of the drine&s;&s;e or barrenne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, and barbarous rudene&s;&s;e of the people, ex|cept it be only along by the coa&s;t of the midland &s;ea. For the Spaniards for the mo&s;t part are wild, and do dwell in villages. That Spaine is all ouer inhabi|ted, one may perceiue by Pomponius; who &s;aith, That it is wonderfully repleni&s;hed with men. And Cicero, in a certaine oration of his, writeth, That the Romanes ouercame them not by multitudes, but by religion and policy. Pliny out of Varro teacheth vs, That they which inhabited this country were the <HI>IBERI, PHOENICIANS, PERSIANS, CELTAE</HI> and <HI>POENI.</HI> The &s;ame al&s;o is auerred by Appianus Alexandrinus. And I to tho&s;e may well ioine the <HI>ROMANES,</HI> who que&s;tionle&s;&s;e, after they had from hence driuen out the Poeni or Carthaginians, did &s;eat them&s;elues and plant their colo|nies heere. But to &s;peake a word or two of the nature, maners and cu&s;tomes of the inhabitants of this country, and to annex vnto the former, what I find noted of that matter in the writings of the be&s;t hi&s;torians, for that I doubt not but it will be a matter both plea&s;ant and plea&s;ing vnto the Reader, I thinke it will not be ami&s;&s;e. Calpurnius Flaccus doth attribute vnto them <HI>flauam proceritatem,</HI> talne&s;&s;e of body, but tawny complexions. Iulius Firmicus &s;aith, that by rea&s;on of the elimate and con&s;titution of the heauens there, The Spaniards are impudent proud braggards. Yet this he in the &s;ame place addeth, That this foule fault is well left of many of them. Florus &s;aith, that the whole Nation generally is vnruly and will by no meanes be commanded or kept in any due obedience. Diony&s;ius Afer calleth it <HI>Nationem magnanimem,</HI> A courageous people: Martiall the Poet, <HI>Trucem,</HI> Grimme: Oppianus, <HI>Su|perbam,</HI> Proud: Tibullus, <HI>Audacem,</HI> Bold: Vopi&s;cus, <HI>A&s;tutam,</HI> Wilie: Trogus and Liuy, <HI>Feram &amp; bellico&s;am,</HI> Fierce and Warlike, and withall very actiue and nimble of body: men of vnquiet &s;pirits, alwaies de&s;irous of newes and alterations in &s;tates and common wealths: of nature more like to wild bea&s;ts, than ciuil men. Vegetius the warriour, &s;aith that, They are lu&s;tier men of body and farre &s;tronger than the Romanes. Virgil in his Georgickes calleth them <HI>Iberos impacatos,</HI> Turbulent Spaniards: for that, as Seruius interpreteth the word, they are ranke riders and great &s;tealers of cattell: or for that, as Iunius Philargyrus vnder&s;tandeth it, they hold robbing and burglary to be the be&s;t kind of life. Their bodies are fit for all maner of labour and hard&s;hip, of &s;uch &s;tomackes that they will venture life and limme vpon the lea&s;t cau&s;e that is, as Valerius Maximus and Trogus doe te&s;tifie: whereupon Silius Italicus writeth thus of them, <HI>Prodiga gens animi, &amp; properare facillima mortem, Namque vbi tran&s;cendit florentes viribus annos, Impatiens aeui, &s;pernit noui&s;&s;e &s;enectam, Et fati modus in dextra e&s;t, &amp;c.</HI> A de&s;perat nation Spaniards are, They care not for their bloud: A&s;&s;oon as e're they come to grow'th, And yeares of mans e&s;tate, To liue vnto a doting age, They &s;corn't as thing not good: Therefore ech man will be the meanes To ha&s;ten on his fate &amp;c. They are &s;o deuoted and addicted to their kings, as Seruius in his Commentaries vpon the fourth booke of Virgils Georgickes, citeth out of Salu&s;t, that They will de&s;ire to liue no longer then they do. To their enemies they are very cruell, but toward &s;trangers pa&s;&s;ing humane and kind. For trauellers or forreners &s;uch as come to them, they do mo&s;t curtuou&s;ly entertaine: &s;o that oft times they do one &s;pite another and contend for that honour and credit, as Diodorus Siculus reporteth. Ptolemey in his Quadripartite writeth, That they are a very neat and cleanly people. This al&s;o is a|uouched by Diodorus, yet he in this one thing mi&s;liketh them for this one &s;louenly and filthy tricke, to wit, for that they do ordinarily v&s;e to wa&s;h their bo|dies all ouer, and their teeth with vrine, taking it to be an excellent Phy&s;icke and pre&s;eruatiue for the body: yea and the &s;ame authour writeth that they do &s;aue and keepe it in ce&s;ternes vntill it be &s;tale for that purpo&s;e. Yet Strabo the learned Geographer a&s;cribeth this to the Cantabri and their nere neigh|bours onely. Catullus the Poet attributeth it as proper vnto the Celtiberi. Apuleius in his fir&s;t Apologie which he wrot in his own defence, maketh men|tion of the wa&s;hing of their teeth. We read in Diodorus Siculus, that at their meales they eat lu&s;tily vpon &s;undry di&s;hes, that they make their drink of hony,

<PB REF="266"> and do buy all the wine they drinke. Yet peraduenture this is meant and to be vnder&s;tood only of tho&s;e which dwell vpon the coa&s;t of the Midland &s;ea. For Flo|rus and Pliny do write that they v&s;ed ordinarily a kind of drinke made <HI>ex frumento &s;oluto,</HI> of a kind of bread corne ground or beaten &s;mall, (which drinke of theirs Pliny calleth <HI>Caelia</HI> and <HI>Caeria</HI>) yea and of Barly too, as Dio&s;corides in the <HI>110.</HI> chapter of his &s;econd booke writeth. <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. that is, Moreouer that kind of drinke which they call <HI>Curmy,</HI> made al&s;o of Barley, v&s;ually drunke in &s;ome places in &s;tead of wine, maketh the head ake, breedeth ill bloud and hurteth the nerues and &s;inewes. Such kind of drinkes al&s;o are made of wheat in the We&s;t part of Spaine and in England. Thus farre Dio&s;corides. This kind of drinke the Welchmen do euen to this day call <HI>Cwrw,</HI> by the &s;ame name very little or nothing altered, as we haue &s;hewed before, and is that which the Saxons call <HI>Ale.</HI> Strabo affirmeth that the Lu&s;itani or Portugals did drinke a kind of drinke which they called <HI>Zy|thum,</HI> (made al&s;o of Barley but much different from Curmi, as the &s;ame Dio&s;corides at the &s;ame place teacheth) for they haue, &s;aith he, &s;mall &s;tore of wine. And that little which they haue, they &s;pend by and by in banquetting and making merry with their friends and kinsfolke. This their drinke made of &s;teeped corne, as the forenamed Pliny in the <HI>22.</HI> chapter of his <HI>14.</HI> booke writeth, will endure to be kept long, and is the better for the age. For this cau&s;e it was perad|uenture that Athenaeus in his Deipno&s;ophi&s;ton, accounteth the Spaniards amongst tho&s;e nations that will ordinarily be drunke. The &s;ame al&s;o doth Plato write of the Celtiberi. That they had but &s;mall &s;tore of wine in Straboes time, it is very probable, becau&s;e that Vopi&s;cus hath left recorded, that Probus the Empe|rour was the fir&s;t that euer gaue licence to the Spaniards to &s;et and plant vines, and to make wine. Trogus &s;aith that they be hard and very niggardly. And al|though they be very wealthy, as Athenaeus te&s;tifieth, yet they will drinke water, liue &s;paringly, dine and &s;uppe alone, that they may go braue and hang the more vpon their backs. Nay as Trogus affirmeth, vpon their greate&s;t fe&s;tiuall daies they neuer v&s;ed to make any great preparation or extraordinary cheere. Dio&s;cori|des writeth that they v&s;ed wild rocket &s;eed in &s;ted of mu&s;tard &s;eed. Pliny writeth, That in his time they did account akorns &amp; ma&s;t for a dainty di&s;h: and Strabo &s;aith, that of the flower of them they did v&s;ually make their hou&s;hould bread. And Pliny he affirmeth that this kind of bread was lighter than any other &s;ort of bread, becau&s;e they did leauen it. That they did v&s;e to lie vpon the bare ground, the &s;ame Pliny doth te&s;tifie. They did weare a &s;hort blacke garment, as Dio|dorus Siculus writeth. I&s;idorus in the <HI>23.</HI> chapter of the <HI>19.</HI> booke of his <HI>Origines,</HI> nameth a certaine kind of garment, worne by the Spaniard, <HI>Striges.</HI> They had rather haue warres, than re&s;t and peace. When they haue no enemy abroad, they &s;eeke for him at home, if one may beleeue Trogus the Hi&s;toriographer. In warre not only the hor&s;emen, but al&s;o the footmen, are farre &s;tronger, harder, and able to endure any manner of labour and paines then any other nation what|&s;oeuer. They giue the on&s;et and beginne the battell with &s;ongs and poeticall rymes, as the &s;ame authour with Silius Italicus doth te&s;tifie; <HI>Ritu iam moris Ibe|ri Carmina pul&s;ata fundentem barbara cetra,</HI> Then like as Spaniards v&s;e, In &s;tead of drumme they targets &s;ounds, And warlike &s;ongs do tune. And lea|ning or re&s;ting them&s;elues vpon two &s;words, hauing beaten and di&s;ordered the enemies hor&s;emen, they light off from their hor&s;es, and doe adioine them&s;elues to their footmen: which very &s;ame thing Suidas &s;peaketh of the Celtiberi. The&s;e &s;words, as it is apparant out of Liuy and Polybius, by rea&s;on of their &s;hortne&s;&s;e were very nimble, and more fit for clo&s;e fight: they had al&s;o &s;harpe points, &s;o that in &s;ight they did rather v&s;e foines and thru&s;ts, then downe right blowes. Not|with&s;tanding Suidas in that commendeth the excellency of the &s;words v&s;ed by the Celtiberi, that their fight is hot and de&s;perate and that they will abide a mighty &s;troke with both the hands. Athenaeus al&s;o &s;heweth that they in fight v&s;ed the French weapon called <HI>Ge&s;um,</HI> where he telleth vs that the Romanes v|&s;ed to fight with that kind of weapon, and learned to handle it of the Spaniards. And they, as it is very probable out of Iulius Pollux, tooke it of the Africanes, for he calleth it <HI>Gae&s;am Lybicam,</HI> and termeth it an iron &s;peare or parti&s;an. They weare head-pieces made of bra&s;&s;e. Their legges they wrappe vp in a kind of bootes made of haire, as Diodorus Siculus te&s;tifieth. Strabo, the great Co&s;mographer, writeth, That in battell they v&s;e to beare a light kind of armour, targets, darts, and &s;lings. They did fight, as Polybius &s;aith, being apparelled in linnen garments garded or laid about with a purple welt, and in long &s;ide coates as white as the drift &s;now. And although they did weare tragicall robes or gownes, and were clad with many coates, and tho&s;e, when they went abroad, hanging downe to their feet, yet, as Athenaeus te&s;tifieth, they were not by that meanes one whit the more vnwealdy in fight, cowardlike, or le&s;&s;e valiant and courageous. This was their armour and warlike habite. But this one thing, which you &s;hall find in the <HI>7.</HI> booke of Ari&s;totles Politickes, I do thinke may not be omitted, to wit, that he there recordeth that &s;o many columnes or pillars were wont to be pitched vp about the graues or &s;epulchres of the dead, as they had killed enemies. Nor this of Silius Italicus in his <HI>13.</HI> booke may be forgotten, <HI>Tellure, vt perhibent, is mos antiquus, Ibera Exanima ob&s;coenus con&s;umit corpora vultur,</HI> vpland, they &s;ay, an ancient cu&s;tome t'is, That carren crowes and rauening kite &s;hould pray and quite con&s;ume the fle&s;h Of Spaniards braue departed hence. Yet Aeli|anus affirmeth this peculiarly of the Barcaei, and that of tho&s;e only which did die in the field or were &s;laine in the warres: but tho&s;e which died in their beds, of any naturall &s;ickne&s;&s;e, were as he &s;aith burnt to a&s;hes. Cae&s;ar writeth that they are all by nature giuen to &s;wimming, and to practi&s;e to &s;wimme ouer deepe and broad riuers, and that it is a thing generally &s;o common amongst them, that no man will heere goe into the field or campe without his bladders or water bouget &s;eruing to that purpo&s;e. In the fragments of Salu&s;t I read that it was their maner, that when yong men were fir&s;t trained, and were to go to the warres, their mothers did recite vnto them all the valiant acts of their ance&s;tours. Trogus affirmeth, That many of them did more e&s;teeme of their armour, and great hor&s;es which had &s;erued in the warres, then they did of their owne liues. They were wont al&s;o, as Strabo teacheth vs, to prepare for them&s;elues <HI>Toxicum,</HI> that is, a kind of confection that killeth a man without any maner of griefe or paine. This they made of a certaine herb like to &s;mallage, <HI>(apium)</HI> that they might haue it al|waies by them in a readine&s;&s;e, what cro&s;&s;e luck or misfortune &s;oeuer &s;hould betide them. Florus &s;aith that they do for this purpo&s;e draw a certaine poi&s;on out of the yewgh-tree <HI>(taxus.)</HI> Pliny al&s;o &s;peaketh of this cu&s;tome of theirs, but he &s;aith that they make it of the berries of the yewgh-tre. And thus much hitherto of the nation in generall: now a word or two of &s;ome of them particularly. The <HI>LVSITANI</HI> or <HI>Portugals</HI> were more valiant and better &s;ouldiers than the re&s;t, but they were very infamous for pilfering &amp; theeuery, they giue not the~&s;elues to hu&s;bandry or tillage of the ground, they are not able fellowes for &s;cowts &amp; ambu&s;hes, very nimble, light and quicke of retraict. For their drinke they did v&s;e <HI>Zythum,</HI> as we &s;aid before. <HI>Butter</HI> doth &s;erue their turne in &s;tead of oile. Their di|&s;hes and &s;uch like ve&s;&s;els were made of wax. Their boates were made of leather, vntill the time of Brutus. Yet afterward they had hoies and &s;uch like &s;hips of burden, as it is manife&s;t out of Strabo, who doubteth not to equall the number and greatne&s;&s;e of them with tho&s;e of the Africanes. This al&s;o is iu&s;tified by Sidoni|us, in his Panegyricke oration made to Maiorianus. Amongst this people, as Pliny reporteth, was the <HI>Carba&s;&s;us,</HI> a kind of linnen for &s;ailes of &s;hips, fir&s;t inuen|ted. Such was the life of the&s;e Lu&s;itaui. The <HI>CALAICI, ASTVRES,</HI> and <HI>CANTABRI,</HI> euen vp as high as the <HI>VASCONES</HI> and the Pyrenaean mountaines did liue much like the Lu&s;itani, as Varro in his booke of Hu&s;bandry, Dion Ca&s;&s;ius, Io&s;ephus the Iew, and Strabo the great Co&s;mographer do te&s;tifie, in whom and in Diodorus Siculus thou mai&s;t read many other things of this people. Sextus Auienus calleth the inhabitants a churli&s;h and rough people; Item, <HI>Gens i&s;ta dura, gens fera venatibus, Lu&s;tri&s;que inhaerens,</HI> This nation's hard and &s;tout, All woodmen wild and giuen to hunt, and range the woods about. But of the <HI>CANTABRI,</HI> heare what Silius Italicus, the worthy Poet in his <HI>3.</HI> booke reporteth: <HI>Cantaber ante omnes hyemi&s;&abque; ae&s;tu&s;&abque; fami&s;&abque; Inuictus, palmam;&abque; ex omni ferre labore. Mirus amor populo, cum pigra incanuit aetas Imbelles iamdudum annos praeuertere &s;axo: Nec vitam &s;ine Mar|te pati, quippe omnis in armis Lucis cau&s;&s;a &s;ita, &amp; damnatum viuere paci.</HI> In effect thus much in Engli&s;h; The Cantaber can endure the chilling cold of winter, the heat of parching &s;ummer, hunger, labour or any maner of toile, better than any other nation of all Spaine. It is a &s;trange thing to &s;ee how this people is delighted; a&s;&s;oone as euer they begin to grow in yeares and to be gray-headed, and &s;o no longer fit for labour or any manner of &s;eruice, they'll make an end of them&s;elues. No man heere de&s;ireth to liue out of the warres, for euery one thinketh that he is borne for no other purpo&s;e, all generally condemning peace and the idle life. Strabo calleth the <HI>CELTIBEROS, togatos,</HI> peaceable men, and &s;aith that they were &s;ometime held to be the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t barbarous and in|humane people of all Europe, but now it is a populous and wealthy nation. The &s;ame Strabo deemeth the <HI>TVRDETANOS</HI> to haue beene the learned&s;t people of Spaine. For that they did v&s;e the Grammar, and had certaine monuments of antiquity, recorded and kept amongst them in writing, and withall their lawes and &s;tatutes were written and pre&s;erued in ver&s;e, and certaine poeticall meeter. The &s;ame authour termeth the <HI>CARPETANOS, VACCAEOS, LA|CETANOS,</HI> and <HI>CALLAICOS, nobiles gentes,</HI> noble and braue nations. But of the&s;e la&s;t I cannot but againe cite the words of the forenamed Silius, where he thus &s;peaketh of them; &mdash;<HI>Mi&s;it diues Gallecia pubem, Barbara nunc patrijs vlulantem carmina linguis, Nunc pedis alterno percu&s;&s;a ver|bere terra Ad numerum re&s;onas gaudentem plaudere cetras. Haec requies, ludu&s;&abque; viris, ea &s;acra voluptas. Caetera femineus peragit pudor: ad|dere &s;ulco Semina, &amp; impre&s;&s;o tellurem vertere aratro. Segne viris quicquid duro &s;ine Marte gerendum e&s;t. Callaici coniux obit irrequieta ma|riti.</HI> And becau&s;e that he &s;peaketh heere al&s;o of the women, hearken what Trogus &s;aith of them: The women, &s;aith he, do manage all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es at home and with|in doores, they looke vnto the hu&s;bandrie and plowing of the ground: the men giue them&s;elues wholly to follow the warres, to robbe and &s;teale. The &s;ame doth Strabo report of them, who be&s;ides addeth that when they are deliuered of child, the hu&s;bands at their reque&s;t &s;hall keepe their beds, and they will &s;crue thcm. And while they are at work oft times they wa&s;h their litle ones, and making them ready, do lay them to &s;leepe vpon the brinke of &s;ome brooke or riuer. Once euery yeare they lay all their webs which they haue &s;punne in open &s;ight to bee viewed of all men, and &s;hee which in the iudgement of mo&s;t men hath laboured harde&s;t, beareth away the bell and greate&s;t commendation, as Stobaeus, in the chapter of Temperance, out of one Nicolaus, hath left recorded. Amongst the Cantabri the hu&s;band giueth a dowry to the wife, and the daughters are made heires of their fathers lands and goods, and by them the brethren are be&s;towed in mariage. The fa&s;hion of the apparell and maner of attire of the&s;e women, is de&s;cribed by the &s;ame authour, as you may read in Artimedorus. The buildings and hou&s;es of this country were made, as we may vnder&s;tand by Vitruuues, the famous Architect, of timber, roads, &s;traw, reeds and leaues. Wals they haue which they call <HI>formaceos,</HI> or as &s;ome read <HI>fornaceos,</HI> for that being enclo&s;ed round in maner of a form on both &s;ides with two boords, they were rather &s;tuffed then workmanly built, as Pliny in the <HI>14.</HI> chapter of his <HI>13.</HI> booke doth te&s;tifie. Of the religion of the ancient Spaniards I find little ob&s;erued by any good authours: and that which is noted of that argument you &s;hall find in Strabo: to wit, That the <HI>LVSITANI,</HI> did &s;acrifice a goat to Mars, and be&s;ide that, their pri&s;oners taken in the warres, and their great hor&s;es. Item, That they v&s;ed to diuine and foretell of things to come by the entrails of their captiues and pri&s;oners. Item, That after the maner of the Greeks they held certaine &s;olemne fea&s;ts which they call <HI>Hecatombas,</HI> wherein an hundred bea&s;ts were &s;acrificed at once. Item, Certaine ga|mings, in maner of their Olympiackes. That they were not altogether vnskilfull of that kind of diuination, made by the ob&s;eruation of the entrails of bea&s;ts &s;acri|ficed, called by the Romanes <HI>Aru&s;picina,</HI> we may &s;ee by that &s;aying of Lampridius &s;poken of Alexander Seuerus, to wit, in that he &s;aith, That he was more skil|full in that art, than they. In Macrobius I find that the <HI>ACCITANI,</HI> did wor&s;hip and do diuine honour vnto Mars, which they in their language call <HI>Necys.</HI> Some haue reported, That the <HI>CALLAICI</HI> had no maner of perceiuerance at all of any god. But the <HI>CELTIBERI,</HI> and their neere neighbours in the North
<PB REF="266"> parts, did wor&s;hip a certaine vnknowen god at night in the full moone, dancing and making merry, before the gates with all their families and hou&s;holds all nightlong. Yet it is apparant out of Pliny that in old time many yeares ago the <HI>Saguntim,</HI> did reuerence and diuine wor&s;hip vnto Diana, brought thither by tho&s;e of Zacynthus <HI>(Zante) 200.</HI> yeares before the de&s;truction of Troy. Thus far of the nation. But that we may &s;hew a little more plainly the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of this people, I think it not ami&s;&s;e out of the be&s;t Hi&s;torians to &s;et downe &s;ome few other ob&s;eruations which we haue noted concerning this argument. At what time the <HI>VETTONES</HI> came fir&s;t to be &s;ubiect to the command of the Romans, &amp; did ob&s;erue certain captains &amp; lieutenants for recreation &s;ake to &s;tray &amp; wander vp &amp; down the fields, they &s;uppo&s;ing them to be be&s;ide them|&s;elues, tooke them and led them home to their cottages or dwelling places. For they thought that either they were to &s;it &s;till in peace at home, or el&s;e to fight it out. This was an argument of their &s;implicity. See the <HI>5.</HI> chapter of the <HI>2.</HI> book of Aelians <HI>de varia hi&s;toria.</HI> In the wars between the Romans and the Cantabri, the mothers killed their owne children, left they &s;hould fall into the enemies hands. <HI>A</HI> child at the commandement of his father, with a &s;word killed his father, mother and brethren being taken cap|tiues by the enemy. And againe, a woman in like maner killed her children and hu&s;band with others taken with her. One being called into the company of &s;waggering to&s;&s;e-pot drunkards leapt into the fire and burnt him&s;elfe. The&s;e were arguments of their great loue of liberty. Others of them, being taken in the field and nailed to the pillory, they report, did &s;ing triumphantly as if they had gotten the victory. This was an argument of their contempt of death. Thus much out of Strabo: tho&s;e which follow are taken out of Trogus. In the Punicke wars the patience of that &s;eruant is highly commended, who reuenging his ma&s;ters death, in the midde&s;t of all his torments did laugh hartily, and with a merry plea&s;ant countenance did ouercome the cruell executioners. This is a notable example of true fortitude and valour. Oft times diuer&s;e of them haue been tormented to death for that they would not bewray &s;uch things as were told them in &s;ecret: &s;o that they made greater account of fidelity and &s;ecrecie, than of their liues. Many &s;uch examples as the&s;e, might, out of ancient authours, be referred to this place. But of the nature of this nation let the&s;e few things &s;uffice. Now let vs addre&s;&s;e our &s;elues to &s;peake &s;omething of the country it &s;elfe and nature of the &s;oile. And fir&s;t of the fertility of the &s;ame. Trogus maketh Spaine to be far more fertile than Africa or France. Being neither &s;o much parched as that, with the heat of the Sunne; nor toiled as this, with continuall raging winds: but indifferent between them both: &s;o that partly by rea&s;on of the temperature of the aire, and partly by rea&s;on of the moderate &s;howres and raine which heere do fall, it is mo&s;t fertile of all maner of corne and graine. For, as Philo&s;tratus hath left recorded, heere the temperature of the aire is &s;uch, as it is ordinarily in Autumne at Athens in Greece. Whereupon that in Solinus Polyhi&s;tor is trulie &s;poken of this country. This climate or tract of ground, for goodne&s;&s;e, may iu&s;tly be compared to the be&s;t country in the world, it is in|feriour to none whether you re&s;pect the great plenty of <HI>corne</HI> heere growing, and goodne&s;&s;e of &s;oile, or whether you re&s;pect the number of choice <HI>vines</HI> and <HI>fruit trees,</HI> which heere do naturally come vp of them&s;elues, with the great commodity that ari&s;eth of them. It aboundeth with all things, that are either richly pri&s;ed and greatly e&s;teemed, or found to be nece&s;&s;ary for v&s;e. <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Siluer</HI> if you will &s;eeke for them, they are heere to be found: it neuer failed the <HI>Smithes:</HI> it giueth place to none for <HI>Vines;</HI> it excelleth any other country for &s;tore of the be&s;t <HI>Oiles.</HI> There is no place of it vacant ground, none barren and altogether vnfruitfull. What place &s;oeuer it be through|out this whole country that will not beare &s;ome kind of corn or other good fruit, that is good meddow or pa&s;ture. Yea euen tho&s;e places that &s;eem to be drie &amp; barren, do beare hempe or &s;uch &s;tuffe &s;eruing to make cables for &s;hips. This is al&s;o confirmed by Pomponius Mela, in the&s;e words: It is, &s;aith he, &s;o fertile and well &s;tored with <HI>men, hor&s;es, iron, lead, &s;iluer</HI> and <HI>gold,</HI> that if there be any place of it, which by rea&s;on of want of water, be barren and not like it &s;elfe, yet there it beareth <HI>Hempe, Flaxe,</HI> and a kind of &s;hrubbe called <HI>Spartum,</HI> whereof they made cables for &s;hips. Yet Strabo doth exempt from hence Tudetania, or Batica, who affirmeth that this place hath &s;uch wonderfull plenty of both, I mean of <HI>Mettal</HI> and of <HI>Corn,</HI> that it is impo&s;&s;ible to giue it &s;uch due commendations as for the worthine&s;&s;e of it it doth de&s;erue. Nay it is &s;o fertile of all the&s;e commodities, that as the &s;ame Trogus reporteth, it yeeldeth not &s;ufficient for the v&s;e of the inhabitants only, but be&s;ides that it &s;erueth all Italy and the populous city of Rome. And thus much generally of the nature of the &s;oile and commodities of this country. But Strabo doth &s;omewhat more particularly handle this argument. For he &s;heweth that all the prouinces and &s;hires of Spaine are not alike fertile and good: and tho&s;e countries which haue greate&s;t plenty of mines and mettall are good for lit|tle el&s;e. A great part of it al&s;o is but meanly inhabited, by rea&s;on of the mountaines and woods, with &s;patious and wide champion barren fields, where the &s;oard or earth is very little or none at all. Neither hath it in all places water inough to &s;erue it, as about Carpentania or Celtiberia, and almo&s;t all the North part of it abuttant vpon the &s;ea: which places are not very well inhabited by rea&s;on of the craggine&s;&s;e of the mountaines and bleake coldne&s;&s;e of the aire. This part beareth no maner of corn at all. (Per|aduenture Iuuenal in his <HI>3.</HI> Satyre meant this tract, when he &s;aith, <HI>Horrida vitanda e&s;t Hi&s;pania,</HI> Rough Spaine mu&s;t carefully be &s;hunned.) Yet the skirts of it where it bordereth vpon the Midland &s;ea aboundeth with <HI>Oliues, Figges, Vines,</HI> and other &s;uch like plants and fruit trees, notwith&s;tanding the vpland countries are not alto|gether void and de&s;titute of the&s;e commodities. So that I may not without good cau&s;e heere apply that &s;aying of Silius Italicus, an authour &s;o often by me cited and named: <HI>Nec Cereri terra indocilis, nec inho&s;pita Baccho, Nullaque Palladia &s;e&s;e magis arbore tollit.</HI> Ceres heere hath taught her trade, God Bacchus heere was lodg'd: For choi&s;e&s;t oiles and &s;igges as good, This country well may boa&s;t and bragge. In Lu&s;itania al&s;o, that part e&s;pecially which lieth between the riuer Tagus and the Ariabri, is a very good &s;oile both for corne and gra&s;&s;e. Moreouer it yeeldeth great plenty of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Siluer,</HI> and &s;uch like things. Athenaeus, in the <HI>8.</HI> booke of his Deipno&s;ophi|&s;ton confirmeth the &s;ame. Item, All that part of the country that lieth vpon the South, as Pliny te&s;tifieth, is very good: to wit, all that which they call Baetica is more popu|lous, better manured, a richer &s;oile, more fertile and plea&s;ant than any other country of all Spaine. In this prouince the gra&s;&s;e is &s;o wonderfully ranke, that except the cat|tell be leazed and &s;ometime brought home out of the pa&s;ture and re&s;trained from feeding, they will bur&s;t them&s;elues, as Trogus reporteth. But not only the land, but euen the &s;ea which beateth vpon the coa&s;t of this Turdetania, is al&s;o as fertile: For it is wonderfully &s;tored with all kind of <HI>Oi&s;ters, Shelfi&s;hes, Tunies</HI> and <HI>Purples,</HI> (a kind of &s;helfi&s;h whereof that colour is made) which are very gainfull vnto tho&s;e that will labour to take them. And be&s;ides that, they do &s;alt much of it and pre&s;erue it in pickle. Thus farre therefore of the vpper &s;oard of the earth: Now let vs &s;peake a word or two of the admirable rich mettals of this country, which lie hid vnder the &s;ame. That Spaine is all ouer be&s;trewed with <HI>Gold, Siluer, Iron, Lead, white</HI> and <HI>red,</HI> Pliny and Strabo do iointly te&s;tifie. Of the great plenty of <HI>gold</HI> and <HI>&s;iluer</HI> heere found the Holy &s;cripture in the <HI>8.</HI> chapter of the <HI>1.</HI> booke of the Machabees doth affirme. This al&s;o is auouched by Io&s;ephus in the <HI>16.</HI> chapter of his <HI>2.</HI> booke of the Iewes wars. But it yeeldeth the greate&s;t &s;tore in the drie&s;t and mo&s;t barren mountaines, vpon which nothing el&s;e will grow or thriue. Yet by rea&s;on of the gold, as Pliny witne&s;&s;eth, they are forced and made fruitfull. Such are tho&s;e which do inclo&s;e Ba&s;tetania and Oretania, in which Strabo &s;aith there are &s;ome veines of <HI>Gold ore.</HI> The &s;ame authour writeth, That in mount Argent, not farre from Ca&s;tulon by Ilipa and both the Si&s;apoes there is a veine of <HI>&s;iluer.</HI> Polybius &s;aith that this veine runneth along by the city Babyla. In the confines of Mile&s;&s;ia, where the city Oringis &s;tandeth, Liuy writeth that the inhabitants do find good &s;tore of <HI>&s;iluer.</HI> Neere vnto the riuer Tagus al&s;o, in the moun|taines are mines of <HI>mettall.</HI> At Cotinas are found both <HI>copper</HI> and <HI>gold,</HI> as the &s;ame Strabo te&s;tifieth. The prouince of Gallecia (this Trogus affirmeth) is wonderous full of <HI>copper</HI> and <HI>lead:</HI> it is al&s;o very rich of <HI>gold,</HI> &s;o that oft times euen the plough doth turne vp &s;ome clots of <HI>gold ore.</HI> Pliny doth affirme that the &s;ame Gallecia, A|&s;turia, and Lu&s;itania, are as fertile of all maner of <HI>mettals.</HI> Stabo hath left recorded that amongst the &s;parkes of gold ore heere found &s;ome haue beene tried to waigh more then halfe a pound weight. Diodorus Siculus out of Phalereus reporteth the &s;ame, who &s;aith, that &s;ome of tho&s;e which heere do dig in the mines do euery three daies find as much in weight as an Euboian talent, which of Troy weight amounteth to aboue <HI>36.</HI> pound. Stephanus mentioneth the city Ibilla, where he &s;aith there are mines both of <HI>&s;iluer</HI> and <HI>gold.</HI> But the greate&s;t &s;iluer-mine is neere new Carthage, di&s;tant from the city about <HI>20.</HI> furlongs, where <HI>40000.</HI> men are emploied and &s;et on worke; and euery day throughout the yeare, the people of Rome, as Strabo te&s;tifieth, receiued from hence <HI>25000.</HI> drams of &s;iluer. The &s;ame author writeth that there was a pit of &s;iluer cal|led Bebelus, which did find Hanniball daily <HI>300.</HI> pound weight of &s;iluer. That this pit was about the Pyreney mountaines, one peraduenture may ge&s;&s;e by that, which he withall affirmeth, that the Aquitani do fetch their water from hence. The great abundance of &s;iluer which did runne from the Pyreney mountaines, being by ca&s;ualtie &s;et on fire (which &s;tory you &s;hall find in Strabo and Diodorus Siculus) was &s;uch that the Phoenicians when they tran&s;ported it from hence, and yet &s;till there being left more than their &s;hips could carry, in &s;tead of lead they put it vnder the ancors, or, as Ari&s;totle thinketh, about Tarte&s;&s;us they made their ancors of it. It is ob&s;erued by Strabo that the Turdetani did make their cribs (<HI>prae&s;epia,</HI> yet the learned Cau&s;abone doth rather thinke that the Greeke word in this place &s;hould &s;ignifie <HI>Lacunaria,</HI> a &s;ommer or maine beame in an hou&s;e) and hog&s;heads, of &s;iluer. Yea and that certaine riuers of this country do yeeld &s;ome &s;parkes of gold, amongst which Tagus in Lu&s;itania was one, there is none of the old writers but did con&s;tantly affirme for truth. Whereupon the Poets of former times haue highly commended Spaine for this matter, to wit, Iuuenall and Sta|tius: Item Silius Italicus in this ver&s;e: <HI>Hic certant Pactole tibi Duria&s;&abque; Tagu&s;&abque;,</HI> Rich Pactolus now may yeeld, to Dwere and Tayo &s;tout. The great abundance of mettals which this country did yeeld may ea&s;ily be proued by the many triumphs of the Romanes, and maruellous &s;tore of gold and &s;iluer by them carried and tran&s;ported from hence; which you &s;hall read of in Liuy, a plentifull witne&s;&s;e and of good credit, in many and &s;undry places of his Decades, whereof for examples &s;ake I thinke it not a|mi&s;&s;e to produce one or two: Marcus Heluius, &s;aith he, brought from hence into the Exchequer at one time of vnwrought &s;iluer <HI>14732.</HI> pound weight. Of coined &s;iluer, bea|ring the &s;tampe of a waggon drawen with two hor&s;es, <HI>17023.</HI> Of Hue&s;ca &s;iluer <HI>(O&s;cen&s;e argentum) 120438.</HI> Cneius Cornelius Lentulus brought from hence of gold <HI>1515.</HI> pound weight: of rough &s;iluer <HI>1000.</HI> of &s;iluer coine, <HI>34550.</HI> denaij, valuing of our money wel-neere <HI>1728.</HI> pound &s;terling. That which the &s;ame doth report of Marcus Portius Cato, Quintus Fuluius Flaccus, Quintus Minutius, Lucius Stertinius, Tiberius Gracchus, Cayus Calpurnius, Lucius Quinctius Cri&s;pinus, Marcus Fuluius Nobilior, Albinus, and others, let them read, who li&s;t to admire the wonderfull &s;tore of mettals of this country. Whereupon Antonius Augu&s;tinus might well &s;ay, That Spain in tho&s;e times was vnto the Romanes the &s;ame, that now the We&s;t Indies are to the Spaniards. But now, le&s;t I be too tedious, I will addre&s;&s;e my &s;elfe to &s;peake of other things which heere are found in as great abundance, as namely, <HI>hor&s;es, dogs, conies, pearles,</HI> and diuer&s;e other &s;uch things. That in Spain there are great &s;tore of <HI>conies,</HI> Strabo, Pliny, and Aelianus do teach vs. The &s;ame is auerred by this ver&s;e of the worthy poet Catullus, <HI>Cuniculo&s;ae Celtiberiae fili,</HI> My &s;onne, in conny-borrow'd Spain ybred. Item, the coyn of Hadrian Emperour of Rome doth te&s;tifie the &s;ame: vpon which this little bea&s;t is &s;tamped as a cogni&s;ance of this country. The <HI>wooll</HI> al&s;o of this country (I meane the blacke fleece, is of better e&s;timation than that of the Coraxici, inhabitants of mount Taurus) the <HI>flax</HI> (wherof mo&s;t excellent nets are made as Gratius witne&s;&s;eth) <HI>Spartum,</HI> a kind of &s;hrubbe like broome, whereof they made their cables, <HI>coccum,</HI> or graine wherewith they die skarlet, <HI>pitch, hony, wax, &s;alt,</HI> digged out of the earth, <HI>(Sal fo&s;&s;ile) Alume, Boras (Chry&s;ocolla) gla&s;&s;e, vermilion,</HI> of no le&s;&s;e e&s;timation then Sinople <HI>(Sinopica terra) purple (purpuri&s;&s;um)</HI> and other colours, <HI>Cry&s;tall,</HI> the <HI>Load&s;tone,</HI> the Gla&s;&s;e-&s;tone, <HI>(lapis &s;pecularis) vitrum ob&s;idianum,</HI> the <HI>Ceraunij</HI> and <HI>Hyacinthi,</HI> certaine pearles and precious &s;tones, are highly commended by Pliny, Strabo, Varro, Diodorus, Florus, Trogus; Dio&s;corides writeth that Spaine doth yeeld <HI>red oker, Cadmia, Schi&s;tus,</HI> and <HI>Sory.</HI> Pau&s;anias in his Arcadica &s;aith, that in Spaine, Cinoper <HI>(Cinnabaris)</HI> is commonly found in the &s;ame mine with gold. Theophra&s;tus teacheth vs that the <HI>Corke-tree</HI> groweth plen|tifully in the Pyreney mountains. Gellius, from the relation of Varro, doth wonderfully extoll the <HI>ma&s;t</HI> of Spaine. Heliodorus mentioneth the Spani&s;p <HI>Amethy&s;t.</HI> The Nar, of the Corritani, a kind of fi&s;h called of the Latines <HI>perna,</HI> is by Strabo preferred before tho&s;e of the Cantabri. Gellius commendeth the <HI>Lampreies</HI> taken neere Tarte&s;&s;us. of the maruellous fat <HI>Swine</HI> of this country Varro in the <HI>11.</HI> chapter of his <HI>2.</HI> booke of Hu&s;bandry, telleth a &s;trange tale: to wit, that the skin did hang ouer their mouthes, a foot and three fingers. Oppianus and Iulius Pollux do greatly commend the <HI>Hounds</HI> of Spaine. So doth Neme&s;ianus. <HI>Quorum proles de &s;anguine manat Ibero:</HI> Tho&s;e whelps the hunt&s;man mo&s;t commend'th, That Spani&s;h race doth yeeld. The &s;ame Varro and Oppianus with Strabo the great Co&s;mographer doe as highly extoll the
<PB REF="267"> <HI>wild hor&s;es</HI> of this country. Of the&s;e I thinke Olympius Neme&s;ianus did &s;peake in the&s;e his ver&s;es: <HI>Quin etiam gens ampla iacet trans ardua Calpes Culmina, cor|nipedum lat&egrave; foecunda proborum &amp;c. Aut inconcu&s;&s;o glomerat ve&s;tigia dor&s;o, Aut molli pacata celer trahit e&s;&s;eda collo.</HI> A mighty nation dwell'th beyond the &s;tately tops of <HI>Calpe</HI> high, Which &s;tore of Hor&s;es good doth breed, e&s;teem'd throughout the world &s;o wide. Some pace it well and amble fine, they neuer hotch nor &s;hake at all: Some draw in plough or cart as well, and runne vp hill as &s;wift as wind. Item, Silius Italicus, an authour often in this hi&s;tory cited by me, reporteth the &s;ame, in the&s;e ver&s;es of his, <HI>Martius hic &s;ompes campos hinnitibus implet, Hinc iuga cornipedes euecti bellica captant;</HI> The warlike &s;teed with mighty noice doth fil the champi|on fields. Martiall al&s;o thus &s;peaketh of them, <HI>Hic breuis ad numerum rapidos qui colligit vngues, Venit ab armiferis gentibus A&s;tur equus.</HI> This little nag that trot'th &s;o fine, and tread'th the mea&s;ures round, Did come from warlike A&s;tures, t'was bred in Spani&s;h ground. The forenamed Silius in another place &s;peaketh thus of a|nother kind: <HI>Hic parus &s;onipes, nec Marti notus.</HI> This little api&s;h tit, For warlike &s;eruice is not fit. Of this kind peraduenture Gratius &s;peaketh thus: <HI>Non tamen Hi&s;pano Martem tentare minace au&s;im,</HI> I dare not for my life to &s;erue in field, vpon the weake-limm'd Spani&s;h tits. Perhaps this is that kind of hor&s;e which Pliny cal|leth <HI>Thieldones,</HI> and <HI>A&s;turcones,</HI> Nags, Hobbies or Gennets, very &s;mall of bone and grow'th. Which in their trauell haue not an ordinary pace, as other hor&s;es, but by gathering vp their feet round do amble gently, which Plautus termeth <HI>tollutim incedere.</HI> Senec&agrave; in his Epi&s;tles calleth them <HI>A&s;turcones &amp; mannos tollutares,</HI> Ambling nags or gennets. Of the coach-hor&s;es (<HI>equi curules,</HI> or, <HI>quadrigales</HI>) bred heere, and for their extraordinary &s;wiftne&s;&s;e much e&s;teemed farre and neere. Quin|tus Aurelius Symmachus maketh a long di&s;cour&s;e. Hee termeth this country <HI>equini pecoris diuitem,</HI> rich in multitude of good hor&s;es. Silius Italicus, the worthy poet &s;aith, that the&s;e hor&s;es are &s;o &s;wift, that they will out &s;trip the winds. Of mares got with foale by the wind, (neere the maine &s;ea about Li&s;bone, or, as Silius writeth a|mongst the Vettenes) in mount Sintra, <HI>(Tagrus)</HI> as Varro &s;aith, or Cabo S. Vincente <HI>(mons &s;acer)</HI> as Columella would haue it) many men haue written many things, and more peraduenture then is true. All generally do attribute this to the nature and quality of the We&s;t wind in tho&s;e parts. Varro and Columella do affirme that the colts or foales bred by this meanes do not liue aboue <HI>3.</HI> yeares: yet Silius &s;aith that they will liue well till they be <HI>7.</HI> yeares old. Columella writeth, that it is a thing well knowen to euery man to be true: Varro telleth it for an incredible matter, yet very true; and withall affirmeth that mares do there conceiue by meanes of the wind, as heere hens doe: who&s;e egs by him are called <HI>Hypenemia,</HI> or, <HI>Subuentanea,</HI> by Pliny <HI>Zephyria,</HI> that is, wind-egs. Ari&s;totle in the <HI>5.</HI> and <HI>6.</HI> books of his hi&s;tory of Liuing creatures &s;peaketh of the&s;e egs. And although Iulius Solinus, and S. Augu&s;tine, in his booke <HI>de ciuitate Dei,</HI> do write, that the &s;ame commeth to pa&s;&s;e, to the mares in Cappadocia; and Homer would make the world beleeue that the North wind makes the mares of Erichthonius with foale, and that I am not ignorant that Aelianus in the <HI>25.</HI> chapter of his <HI>7.</HI> booke <HI>de Animalibus,</HI> doth thinke that euen the winds do make mares more fruitfull; yet I do rather thinke with Trogus that this did ari&s;e of the maruellous fruitful|ne&s;&s;e of the mares and &s;wiftne&s;&s;e of the hor&s;es, which is &s;uch that in that re&s;pect there is iu&s;t cau&s;e to deeme them to haue beene begotten by the wind. Of the&s;e our Silius I|talicus, him&s;elfe a Spaniard borne, writeth thus: <HI>Et venerem occultam genitali concipitaura,</HI> By &s;ecret meanes they do conceiue, The wind doth make them big. And peraduenture Virgil in the&s;e his ver&s;es aim'd at this &s;tory. <HI>Omnes ore ver&s;ae in Zephyrum &s;tant rupibus altis, Exceptant&abque; leues auras, &amp; &s;aepe &s;ine villis Coniu|gijs vento grauidae, (mirabile dictu.)</HI> Be&s;ide the&s;e there are al&s;o certaine other miracles and &s;trange things to be &s;eene and ob&s;erued in Spaine. In Cadima (<HI>ager Car|rinen&s;is,</HI> or, <HI>Catinen&s;is,</HI> as &s;ome copies haue it) there are two &s;prings, whereof the one &s;walloweth vp all things that are ca&s;t into it, the other ca&s;teth them out. In the &s;ame prouince there is another which maketh all the fi&s;hes that are in it to &s;eem as if they were of a golden colour: yet they being out of the water do nothing at all differ from tho&s;e of other waters. In Cantabria the three Tamaricke fountaines (<HI>fontes Tamarici,</HI> Pliny nameth them) <HI>8.</HI> foot di&s;tant one from another, are ordinarily euery day <HI>12.</HI> times drie, and &s;ometime <HI>20.</HI> times, &s;o cleane that you can &s;carce di&s;cerne whether euer they had water in them or not. When as notwith&s;tanding there is another large fountain hard by them that runneth continually; thus farre out of Pliny. Suetonius in Galba &s;aith that a thunderbolt fell into a lake of Cantabria, and that there were <HI>12.</HI> hatchets <HI>(&s;ecures)</HI> found there. In Spaine there is a riuer which at the fir&s;t &s;ight differeth nothing from other waters: but if you li&s;ten but a little while, you &s;hall heare the water make a fine whi&s;tling noice. For a&s;&s;oone as neuer &s;o little wind &s;hall but moue the pooles or deeper places, the water re&s;oundeth melodiou&s;ly like a mu&s;icall in&s;trument. The wind &s;triketh in manner of the quill, the water &s;erueth in &s;tead of the cittron, as Achilles Statius writeth in his <HI>1.</HI> booke <HI>De Amoribus.</HI> In the confines of Gallecia there is a mountaine called <HI>Mons Sacer,</HI> (Pico Sagro, the Spaniards do yet to this day call it) which it was not lawfull to dig or &s;trike with any iron toole: but if at any time by fall of thunderbolt the ground were broke~, which in the&s;e countries is an ordinary thing, the gold which by that means &s;halbe di&s;couered, is gathered by tho&s;e which come next, as if it were a &s;peciall gift and fauour of God, as Trogus in the <HI>44.</HI> booke of his Hi&s;tory te&s;tifieth. Strabo writeth that in Lu&s;itania (now Portugall) there is a kind of <HI>Salt</HI> found which is of a purple colour. Sidonius in Ore&s;ius affirmeth, That there is another kind of Salt digged out of the mountains of Tarracon, which is &s;weet and of a plea|&s;ant ta&s;t. Amongst the Hi&s;pani Albini about Iberus, Gellius out of Varro de&s;cribeth a great mountaine all of cleane &s;alt: from which looke how much &s;oeuer you &s;hall take from it, &s;o much within a while it will wax and grow againe. Lucian in his vowes, maketh mention of Spani&s;h pickle, or &s;altfi&s;h. Pliny writeth that vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t of Cantabria there is a very &s;teep high hill that is all nothing el&s;e but clean iron. Tho&s;e which fall &s;ick at Caliz <HI>(Gades)</HI> as Philo&s;tratus reporteth, cannot die, their &s;oules can|not depart from them, &s;o long as the tide doth drowne or ouerflow the country. And thus much hitherto of old Spaine, <HI>terris omnibus terra foeliciore, cui excolendae at&abque; adeo ditandae impen&s;ius qu&aacute;m caeteris gentibus</HI> (as Latinus Pacatus &s;aith) <HI>&s;upremus ille fabricator indul&s;it,</HI> that is, This land for goodne&s;&s;e of &s;oile excelleth all lands in the whole world be&s;ide: about the trimming and furni&s;hing of which, and &s;o con&s;equently for the enriching of the &s;ame, almighty God creator of all, be&s;towed more time and care then ordinarily he did for other countries. The de&s;cription of which I purpo&s;e to fini&s;h and clo&s;e vp with that commendation, wherewith Pliny concludeth his Naturall hi&s;tory: <HI>Ab Italia, exceptis Indiae fabulo&s;is, proxim&egrave; quidem dixerim Hi&s;paniam, quocum&abque; ambitur mari,</HI> that is, Next after Italy, excepting al|waies tho&s;e fablous reports of India, I giue Spaine the commendations, vpon tho&s;e &s;ides e&s;pecially which do butte vpon the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Without the limits of the maine land or continent of Spaine, there is a part of this country called <HI>INSVLARIS,</HI> or <HI>BALEARIVM,</HI> that is, The Spani&s;h iles, or, the Baleares. For this part of Spaine con&s;i&s;teth altogether of ilands. The names of tho&s;e which do lie in the Ocean or Maine &s;ea, are the&s;e, <HI>GADES</HI> (now <HI>Caliz) IV|NONIS in&s;ula, GERYONIS monumentum, (S. Pedro,</HI> a little ile betweene Caliz and the maine land) <HI>LONDOBRIS,</HI> ouer again&s;t Portugall, now knowen by the name of <HI>Barlinguas; CORTICATA, AVNIOS, DEORVM in&s;ulae,</HI> peraduenture tho&s;e which they now call <HI>I&s;las de Baiona;</HI> and the faigned <HI>CASSI|TERIDES,</HI> in this tract. For the&s;e famous ilands are indeed tho&s;e which our &s;eamen call <HI>The Sorlings,</HI> belonging to the crowne of England, as we haue &s;hewed before. In the Midland &s;ea are the&s;e following: the two <HI>BALEARES,</HI> the Greater and the Le&s;&s;er <HI>MALLORCA</HI> and <HI>MENORCA:</HI> the two <HI>PITYVSAE,</HI> to wit, <HI>EBV|SVS,</HI> (now <HI>Yuica,</HI> or as &s;ome terme it <HI>Ibi&s;&s;a</HI>) and <HI>OPHIVSA; SCOMBRARIA (Cabo di Palos) COLVBRARIA, (Moncolobrer) CAPRARIA (Cabre|ra) TIQVADRA (Coneiera) PLVMBARIA, PLANESIA,</HI> and <HI>MAENARIA,</HI> all of them, except only the Baleares and Gades, &s;mall ilands and of none ac|count. Gades was much renowmed and famous long &s;ince by meanes of the fables of Hercules and Geryon feigned by Poets to haue been acted heere, as al&s;o for that the long liued king Arganthonius, who was before his death <HI>300.</HI> yeares old, did &s;ometime keepe his court heere. The Baleares were much talked of, by rea&s;on the Ilanders were counted good &s;lingers, be&s;t experienced and skilfull in that weapon called by the Romanes, <HI>Funda.</HI> But e&s;pecially it was much &s;poken of by meanes of the great famine and dearth that there was cau&s;ed by conies: of which there was &s;ometime in the&s;e Ilands &s;uch wonderfull &s;tore and abundance, that old &s;tories do te&s;tifie, that the country people were forced to entreat of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar a military aid and band of men to helpe to de&s;troy them, keepe them from breeding and &s;preading any further. Pliny compareth the winds of the&s;e Ilands with the be&s;t that are made of Italian grapes. I do verily beleeue that Seruius vpon the <HI>7.</HI> booke of Virgils Aeneids did mi&s;take the matter, when he writeth that Geryon did rule as king of the Baleares, and the Pityu&s;aes. For all other writers do affirme, that he reigned and kept his court about Gades. Except in de|fence of Seruius one &s;hould alledge this &s;aying of Trogus: <HI>In parte Hi&s;paniae quae ex in&s;ulis con&s;tat, regnum penes Geryonem fuit:</HI> that is, In a part of Spaine which con&s;i&s;teth altogether of ilands, Geryon &s;waied the &s;cepter, and ruled as &s;oueraigne king. But that he &s;pake this of Gades, and the iland, not farre from it in the maine &s;ea, the wonderfull pa&s;torage and rankene&s;&s;e which he a&s;cribeth to the&s;e is a &s;ufficient argument and proofe; which by no meanes may be verified of the Baleares. Againe, Solinus plainly te&s;tifieth for me that Bocchoris, and not Geryon, did reigne in the Baleares. But his owne words may perhaps plea&s;e thee better; therefore li&s;ten, thus he &s;peaketh: <HI>Bocchoris regnum Baleares fuerunt, v&s;&abque; ad euer&s;ionem Phrygum cuniculis animalibus quondam copio&s;ae. In capite Baeticae, vbi extremus e&s;t NOTI OR|BIS terminus, in&s;ula &agrave; &s;eptingentis pa&s;&s;ibus &s;eparatur, quam Tyrij &agrave; Rubro profecti mari, ERYTHRAEAM, Poeni &s;ua lingua GADIR, id e&s;t, &s;epem nominarunt. In hac Geryonem habita&s;&s;e plurimis monumentis probatur, tamet&s;i quidam putent Herculem boues ex alia in&s;ula abduxi&s;&s;e, quae Lu|&s;itaniam contuetur.</HI> Thus rudely in Engli&s;h. The Baleares where Bocchoris, vntill the ouerthrow of the Phrygians, raigned and held his court, were &s;ometime won|derfully full of Conies. In the entrance and head of Baetica which is the outmo&s;t bound of the <HI>KNOVVEN WORLD,</HI> there is an iland which is di&s;tant from the maine land three&s;core and tenne pa&s;es. This the Tyrians, come from the Red&s;ea, called <HI>ERYTHRAEA,</HI> or, The Red iland: but the Poeni or Carthaginians in their language named it <HI>GADIR,</HI> that is, The hedge. Heere Geryon did &s;ometime dwell, as monuments and antiquities do &s;trongly prooue; although &s;ome do thinke that Hercules did cary the Oxen from another iland, which lieth ouer again&s;t Lu&s;itania. Thus farre Solinus. Ob&s;erue heere that <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Gader,</HI> in the ancient language of the Iewes, and</P>
<P><HI>Giadir,</HI> in the moderne tongue of the farre-conquering Arabians, doth &s;ignifie an hedge, enclo&s;ure, or fence. Be&s;ide the&s;e forenamed ilands knowen to the an|cient and be&s;t writers Sextus Rufus Auienus reciteth others by the&s;e names: <HI>OESTRYMNIDES, ARCHALE, POETANION, AGONIDA, CARTARE, STRONGILE</HI> and <HI>LVNAE.</HI> The&s;e becau&s;e no man el&s;e doth &s;eeme to know or take notice of, peraduenture may be &s;ome of tho&s;e which Pliny termeth <HI>mari vado&s;o par|uas,</HI> Small ilands or &s;helues in the &s;hallow &s;ea, and are in number well neere twenty. What if to the&s;e I &s;hould adioine <HI>CROMYVSA</HI> and <HI>MELVSSA,</HI> certaine ilands vpon the coa&s;t of Spaine, as Stephanus citeth out of Hecataeus his Co&s;mography?</P>
<P>Of <HI>TRANSFRETANA</HI> or <HI>TINGITANA Hi&s;pania,</HI> that other part, I meane, of Spaine, beyond the &s;treights, called Tingitania, (becau&s;e it did only in name and v&s;urpation, not indeed and of right belong to Spaine: as al&s;o for that it is, thus Pomponius Melawriteth of it, <HI>Regio ignobilis, &amp; vix quidquam illu&s;tre &s;ortita, paruis opidis habitatur, parua flumina emittit, &s;olo quam viris melior, &amp; &s;egnitiae gentis ob&s;cura,</HI> Aba&s;e country, and hath &s;carce any good thing in it worth the &s;peaking of. It hath no famous cities but &s;mall ragged townes and villages. The riuers which runne through it are very &s;mall and not nauigable: yet the &s;oile is better than the men. For the &s;louththfulne&s;&s;e and cowardice of the people hath made the country the more ob&s;cure:) I will &s;peake nothing of in this place.</P>

<HEAD>GALLIA, (now FRANCE) as it was in the time of STRABO <HI>and the re&s;t of the ancient Geographers.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_ALl that tract of the earth, which the Ocean, the midland &s;ea, the Pyreney mountaines and the riuer Rheine do containe and compa&s;&s;e, is cal|led of old wtiters GALLIA or GALACIA, and the inhabitants CELTI or CELTAE. Whereupon Ptolemey properly named it CEL|TOGALACIA. We haue demon&s;trated and &s;hewed at large in the olde map of Europe, that the name <HI>Celtes</HI> was more generall in times pa&s;t: and that <HI>Gallia</HI> did reach beyond the Alpes as farre as the riuer Rubicon; becau&s;e indeed that part of Italy (as we know) was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and in|habited by them. But we purpo&s;e heere onely to de&s;cribe that which is properly and truly called <HI>Gallia,</HI> who&s;e bounds we haue &s;et downe to be the Ocean, the Rhine and the mountaines. This the Romanes diuided into GALLIA TRANSALPINA, that is, Gallia beyond the Alpes and GALLIA CISALPINA, that is, Gallia on this &s;ide the Alpes. Mela and Plinic diuided it into two parts, the one lying Northward, the other Southward: this Pliny and his imitatour Solinus by the two hils Gebenna and lura: Mela by the hill Gebenna and the riuer Rho&s;ne: after whch maner alio Entropius and Suetonius do di&s;tingui&s;h it. They call that part, which is toward the North GALLIA COMATA; be|cau&s;e the inhabitants did weare long haire: the other toward the South GALLIA BRACCATA, of a &s;hort kind of coat, which the people of that countrie did commonly goe in. The whole is diuided of Cae&s;ar into three parts: of the which one (&s;aith he) is inhabited by the BEL|GAE, another by the AQVITANI, and the third by them, who in their tongue are called CELTAE, and in ours GALLI. The riuer Ga|ronde parteth the Celtes from the Aquitanes, and the riuers Seine and Marne doe diuide them from the Belgae. But GALLIA NARBO|NENSIS is not mentioned in this diui&s;ion: which part Pliny and Pomponius Mela do de&s;cribe &s;euerally by it &s;elfe, and Cae&s;ar comprehendeth it vnder the name of PROVINCE. Notwith&s;tanding Ptolemey in his de&s;cription, and Ammianus, who followeth him, doth attribute it vnto Gallia, and diuide the whole into foure parts, to wit, AQVITANIA, LVGDVNENSIS (the very &s;ame with <HI>Celtica</HI>) BELGICA and NARBONENSIS. But all doe not limite this diui&s;ion with the &s;ame bounds. For Cae&s;ar placeth the <HI>Heluetians</HI> next to the Gaules or Celtes, whom Pliny and the fore&s;aid Ptolemey place in Belgica. Cae&s;ar maketh Belgica to reach from the Rhine to Marne, Pliny from the riuer Scaldis to the Seine. Cae&s;ar placeth the riuer Garonde as the bound betweene the Celtes and the Aquitanes, &s;o likewi&s;e doth Pomponius Mela; but Strabo boundeth it with the riuer Loire, and that according to the pre&s;cript of Augu&s;tus, with whom al&s;o Ptolemey doth agree. The fore&s;aid Strabo (following I know not what authors) &s;aith that the Belgae inhabite be|tweene the Rhine and the Ocean and among&s;t them numbreth the Veneti, the vtmo&s;t people that dwell towards the We&s;t &s;ea. But I feare much, le&s;t in that place in &s;ted of Belgae he &s;hould haue &s;aid Celtae, &s;eeing that according to all Geographers and Hi&s;toriographers the people Veneti are placed in Gallia Celtica or Lugdunen&s;is. Succeeding ages diuided the whole country of Gallia into many parts, as we may read in Sextus Rufus, Ammianus, a booke intituled Liber Notitiar: and another called Dignitatum Libellulus, which authors doe reckon all the parts and regions thereof to bee &s;euenteene; all which we offer to thy view in this our map. But afterward in proce&s;&s;e of time, to wit, after the time of Charlemaine it was diuided only into two parts the one AVSTRASIA, that is, Ea&s;t France, the other NEVSTRIA (as they corruptly write it) or <HI>Ve&s;tria</HI> or rather <HI>We&s;tria,</HI> that is, We&s;t France. And &s;o much concerning the name of this countrie, the limitation and the bounds, which Suetonius in the life of Iulius affirmeth to containe in compa&s;&s;e 32. hundred miles. Now it remaineth that we write &s;omewhat in like maner of the nature, temperature and commodities of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Claudian writeth that it is a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and a happy country in re&s;pect of the &s;ituation of it. And Cae&s;ar in his third booke of Ciuil wars reporteth it to be mo&s;t healthful. Seneca in his third of Naturall Que&s;tions &s;aith it is full of brookes and riuers. Solinus recordeth it had in times pa&s;t &s;acred and vaporous fountaines. Strabo de&s;cribeth it to be all well watered and moi&s;tned with brooks and riuers, and that the places, along which they runne, are for the mo&s;t part champion grounds (for Sidonius &s;aith, that heere are large and o|pen) or el&s;e &s;mall ri&s;ing hils. The &s;ame authour recordeth that it beareth great &s;tore of graine, millet, and ma&s;te, and that it breedeth all maner of cattell. [The forementioned Sido|nius in Maioranus his Panegyricke writeth that it is plentifully &s;tored with cattel.] There is in it nothing &s;uperfluous, vnle&s;&s;e it be, where it is either marri&s;h or fenny, or ouergrown with wood. Trebellius in his Bali&s;ta maketh it to be fruitfull of graine, which &s;ame thing Cicero affirmeth to be true in his oration for Marcus Fonteius: where hee wrireth that great &s;tore of corne was woont to be carried out of this country by the Romanes, and we may read in Cae&s;ars third booke of his Commentaries and in Dions 39. booke how they did v&s;e to &s;end their Amba&s;&s;adours for proui&s;ion of corne vnto the Veneti, a people of this country. But Pliny te&s;tifieth that this corne was the lighte&s;t and wor&s;t kind of all tho&s;e &s;orrs of corne that were v&s;ually brought to Rome. The &s;ame authour in another place hath left in writing that the people of Aquitane did eate panicke. Solinus extolleth France for a fortunate country in re&s;pect of the fatne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, and many rich commodities, in many places al&s;o repleni&s;hed with vines and orchards &amp; ble&s;&s;ed with &s;tore of all things nece&s;&s;arie for the behoofe of man. But let vs heare al&s;o what Pomponius Mela &s;aith of this countrie. It is a land verie fruitfull, chieflie of gra&s;&s;e and corne, and plea&s;ant to behold and beautified with many great and goodly forre&s;ts. Any kind of corne, that cannot well away with cold, the country yeeldeth not euery where, neither is there heere any great &s;tore of hurtfull and noi&s;ome bea&s;ts. Let vs heere al&s;o what Iulian the Emperour in his Mi&s;opogones, an eie-witne&s;&s;e &s;aith of this country: The winter there is mo&s;t milde, by rea|&s;on of the heat of the Ocean as it is thought, or el&s;e it may be becau&s;e there bloweth thence a certaine &s;oft gale of winde: and the &s;ea water &s;eemeth to bee warmer than the fre&s;h water. Whether it be therefore for this rea&s;on, or for any other vnknowen to me, I cannot tell, yet of this I am &s;ure that this is true. The Winter of that land is verry temperate and milde to the inhabitants: moreouer the be&s;t vines do grow there: and many al&s;o by their art and indu&s;trie haue now made fig-trees to grow there, which in winter they are faine to couer ouer with wheat &s;traw or &s;tubble and &s;uch like things, as it were with clothes, thereby to defend them from the violence and iniuries of the aire. Thus farre out of Iulian. It is true indeed that the cold, (becau&s;e the country, according to Cae&s;ar in his fir&s;t booke of Commentaries lieth farre North) is woont to &s;tay and &s;lacke the ripene&s;&s;e of corne. Wherefore we may fitly adde to this place that, which Varro hath &s;et downe in his fir&s;t booke of husbandrie: In Gallia Tran&s;alpina (&s;aith he) there are &s;ome regions bor|dering vpon the Rhine, where neither vine, nor oliue, nor apples would grow, vnle&s;&s;e they did dung their grounds with a kind of white chaulke digged out of the earth, which Pliny calleth <HI>marga,</HI> that is, marle. but Claudian termeth it <HI>Galliam niue feratem,</HI> France fertile of &s;now: and Lucian &s;peaketh of French ice: and hence commeth that prouerbe in Petronius Arbiter, <HI>Colder than French &s;now.</HI> In&s;omuch that Diodorus confe&s;&s;eth, that when the riuers are frozen ouer, they are not only pa&s;&s;able to few, but euen to whole armies, with their carts and waggons. He addeth likewi&s;e, that in &s;teed of water it is repleni&s;hed with &s;now. Heerehence it is, if I be not deceiued, that Ari&s;totle reporteth among&s;t his wonders, that France breedeth no a&s;&s;es. Seneca in his third booke of Naturall que&s;tions affirmeth it to be windie. The North-We&s;t winde <HI>(Circius)</HI> (&s;aith he) annoieth France: to it, notwith&s;tanding that be ready to ouerthrow their hou&s;es and buildings, they giue thankes, as to whom they attribute their healthfulne&s;&s;e, which peraduenture might &s;eeme fal&s;e and fabulous, if the &s;ame author did not in that very place adde the&s;e words following: Augu&s;tus (who was afterward made a god) erected and dedicated a temple to this wind, at &s;uch time as he &s;oiourned in France. Of this wind you may reade more in Aulus Gellius his 2. booke 22. chapter, but I take it to be that Northen winde, which infecteth tho&s;e places called <HI>Campi lapidei</HI> Stondon, (whereof we &s;hall &s;peake heereafter) where the&s;e things are knowen to be true euen to this day. Cicero in his oration <HI>De prouineijs con&s;u|laribus,</HI> moued (as it &s;eemes) with the &s;harpne&s;&s;e of this aire, cried out truly or fal&s;ly. What can be found more &s;harpe or rough, than tho&s;e places? What more de&s;olate than their townes? What more barbarous than their nations? What more large than their Ocean? Yet for all that, the nature of the aire and &s;oile neuer letted or hindered, but that they learned either of Rome from her cradle, (as Macrobius witne&s;&s;eth in his 2. booke vpon <HI>Somnium Scipionis,</HI> or of the Ma&s;&s;ilians as reporteth Trogus 43. to plant both vines and oliues. Pliny noteth that one Elico, a Swi&s;&s;er or Heluetian (hauing beene entertained at Rome for his skill in &s;miths worke and carpentrie) at his returne againe into his country, brought ouer with him drie figs and rai&s;ons, oile &amp; wine. From which time afterwards there was &s;uch plenty of vines, that Columella doth as it were complaine, that the Italians did lay vp their vintage here: and Plutarch recordeth that they did v&s;e to &s;end to Rome from Vienna in France that wine, which of a kind of ta&s;te that it had of pitch was called <HI>vinum Pica|tum,</HI> a&s;&s;oone as it began to be in reque&s;t there. Therefore I would gladly vnder&s;tand what Vopi&s;cus and Eu&s;ebius &s;hould meane, who deliuer that the Emperour Probus was the fir&s;t that granted the Gauls to plant and &s;et vines. Shall any man thinke that vntill his time there were no vines in any part of France, &s;auing onely in Prouince? Yet Pliny maketh mention of the vine of Berrie, likewi&s;e of the vine of Auuergne. I mu&s;t needs confe&s;&s;e my &s;hallowne&s;&s;e of vnder&s;tanding heerein. Iulian the Emperour writeth in his Mi&s;opogones, that in his time there was an excellent vine at Paris, and I&s;idorus commendeth the vine of Berrie. Strabo plainly &s;heweth that there were heere mettals both gold and &s;iluer and the be&s;t &s;ort thereof in the mountaine Cemmenus, now called <HI>Mountaignes de' Auergne,</HI> or, <HI>de Ceuennes,</HI> as Poldus affirmeth. That there were al&s;o excellent gold-mines among the Tar|belli, and iron mines in Perigort and Berrie. Athenaeus writeth that gold was digged vp in &s;ome part of Celtica. Au&s;onius calleth Tarne, a riuer of Aquitane, the golden floud. Diodorus in his fifth booke reckoneth vp in it diuers golden riuers: from hence it commeth, as we reade in Procopius, that the Gauls did coine gold found in their own natiue &s;oile, which was not &s;tamped like other money, with the picture of the Romane Emperours, but only with a &s;tampe of their owne. Ca&s;&s;iodorus in his &s;euenth booke, and 37. &s;ection of his <HI>Variar.</HI> maketh mention of their coine in the&s;e words: <HI>Gallis auctoribus &s;ine aliquo adhuc &s;igno ad metalla tran&s;lata e&s;t;</HI> Hence it aro&s;e, as &s;eemeth that of Manilius Gallia is tearmed rich; of Dion, flouri&s;hing in wealth: of Io&s;ephus, the rich Galles: and in Sibyls oracles, the Galles wealthy in gold. And how&s;oeuer Diodorus writeth that they haue no &s;iluer, yet Athenaeus reporteth that a wood by a mi&s;chance being &s;et on fire &s;o inflamed the Pyreney mountaines that there i&s;&s;ued and ran foorth great &s;treames of melted &s;iluer. Moreouer Strabo reporteth that there were &s;iluer mines among the Rutheni and Gabali, certaine nations and people of Aquitane: and Cae&s;ar &s;peaketh of certaine mines of bra&s;&s;e in diuers places. It is ob&s;erued by Pliny that the Amethy&s;t, a kind of ia&s;per, is found in France; as al&s;o Corall, neere Mar&s;iles about the Ilands Stoechades. There is al&s;o found Amber, in a riuer of the Celtae, if we may beleeue Dion Pru&s;aeus. For as I thinke it to be true if he meant it of the Celto-Germanes, &s;o I deeme it fal&s;e, if he meant it of the Celto-Galles. There grow heere al&s;o, as Pliny affirmeth, the purple <HI>vaccinia</HI> or whortles, wherewith they did v&s;e to die clothes for their &s;eruants and &s;laues. In another place he attributeth to this coun|try tho&s;e rich tinctures of &s;carlet, purple and tyrian, which were in &s;uch high e&s;timation at Rome. To the &s;ame doth Vitruuius a&s;&s;igne another &s;ort of &s;carlet die. It is true by the te|&s;timony of Galen that Nard (which tne Apothecaries v&s;ed for to make treacle withall) was wont to be brought out of France. Pliny &s;heweth that the be&s;t &s;ort of firre that were, grew vpon the mountaines Iura and Voge&s;us: and el&s;ewhere, that birch fir&s;t came out of France, which they did v&s;e to boile and out of it to draw a glutinous and clammy &s;lime, which &s;erued in &s;teed of bitumen: Item, that the herbe hyacinth or crow-toe do grow and pro&s;per there exceedingly: that they &s;ow line or flaxe, wherwith being &s;pun and wouen (as Strabo writeth) they make &s;ailes, although Cae&s;ar auoucheth that the Veneti people of America or Britaine did v&s;e skinnes or leather in &s;teed of &s;ailes. That there did grow the citron-tree may be gathered out of Paterculus, who affirmeth that Iulius Cae&s;ar made preparation for his French triumph of the citron-tree. But as there are in this country the&s;e and &s;uch like herbs and trees, for the profit and v&s;e of man: &s;o are there tho&s;e that be venemous and pernicious to mans nature. Of which &s;ort is the yew tree, and thereof, accor|ding to the te&s;timony of Cae&s;ar, very great plenty, which Dio&s;corides doth deliuer to be in Narbone of &s;o deadly a poi&s;on, that who&s;oeuer do either &s;leepe vnder it, or &s;hall &s;it and re&s;t them&s;elues in this &s;hade, they be not only hurt, but oft times they do catch their death by it. Concerning which tree Pliny addeth this much, that it hath beene found by ex|perience, that in France the wine bottles made thereof for wayfaring men and trauellers haue killed and poi&s;oined tho&s;e that drunke out of them: And Cae&s;ar witne&s;&s;eth, that one Cat uulcus king of the Eburones made away him&s;elfe with the iuice of the yew tree, whereof (&s;aith he) there was great abundance in France. Ari&s;totle among&s;t his wonders ma|keth mention of a kind of poi&s;on which is found in this country, called of them <HI>xenicon,</HI> the Greeke copy hath <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. But heereof, heereafter we &s;hall haue occa&s;ion to &s;peake in another place. And this much concerning things without life: now concerning liuing creatures by your patience we will in as few words as we may, &s;et down what we haue read and ob&s;erued written by all ancient writers. Trebellius in the life of Claudius the Emperour maketh mention of a famous breed of mares in this country. The infinite number of dogs of this nation be not only highly commended by the Poets, Ouid, Oppian and Gratius; but euen al&s;o by Pollux the Grammarian, and Euphrada the oratour. Pliny &s;aith that he &s;aw with his owne eies in the grand cirque of Pompey the great a hart-woolfe <HI>(Lupus ceruarius)</HI> brought out of France. Their &s;wine, according to the relation of Strabo, be no|table for their bigne&s;&s;e, &s;trength and &s;wiftne&s;&s;e, which are to him that is not v&s;ed to them, as dangerous as the fierce&s;t wolues. For which cau&s;e it cannot be denied but that Athe|naeus wrote very truly that they had the be&s;t bacon, and that (the afore&s;aid Strabo bearing witne&s;&s;e) in &s;uch plenty, that from hence they did therewith furni&s;h not only Rome, but al&s;o mo&s;t places of Italy. I ob&s;erue out of Varro his tract <HI>de lingua Latin&acirc;,</HI> that is, of the Latin tongue, that there be heere very great hares: in which authour al&s;o there is mention made of French wooll, which according to Strabo is very cour&s;e. If any credit be to be giuen to the forceited Pliny, there is found in the vpper coa&s;ts of France towards the North Ocean fowle like to a &s;wan called <HI>Onocrotalus:</HI> item, as he &s;aith, there is found fre&s;h Saln on: in the French Ocean a mighty &s;ea fi&s;h called <HI>Phy&s;eter,</HI> or a whirlepoole, rai&s;ing him|&s;elfe vp aloft out aboue the &s;ea, in maner of a great columne or pillar, higher then the very &s;ailes of &s;hips, &s;pouting out as it were a deluge of waters, ready to drowne and &s;inke euen very tall &s;hips: likewi&s;e there are, as the &s;ame authour &s;aith, mearmaids, elephants and &s;ea-rammes. In the riuer Sone, as Stobeus gathereth out of Cali&s;thenes, there breedeth a huge kind of fi&s;h, called of the inhabitants therabouts <HI>Clupea,</HI> which while the moone increa&s;eth, &s;eemeth white of colour: and the &s;ame decrea&s;ing groweth blacke and when his body groweth to be of an extraordinary bigne&s;&s;e, he is killed of his owne chines or bones. In the head of this fi&s;h is found a &s;mall &s;tone, not vnlike to a graine of Salt, (Plutarch in his booke <HI>de Montibus,</HI> affirmeth it to be like a crumme or little quantity of Frankincen&s;e) which is a &s;peciall remedy again&s;t the quartane ague, if in the wane of the moone it be but applied to the left &s;ide of the body. Glycas out of Ana&s;ta&s;ius tearmeth this fi&s;h <HI>Clopia,</HI> but Plutarch, in the place before quoted, nameth it, <HI>Scolopidon.</HI> It is almo&s;t incredible what a maruellous multitude of frogs be heere: &s;uch was, I &s;ay, the abundance of them, that the inhabitants of a certaine city were driuen out and forced to &s;eeke another place to dwell in. Yet Pliny, of whom we haue &s;o often &s;poken, auoucheth it to be true, citing Varro for his authour; and Trogus in his 15. booke confirmeth it, affirming the like thing to haue hap|pened to the Abderites, a certaine people of Thrace. But let vs come to other more wonderfull things of this region: and fir&s;t the hi&s;tory of fi&s;hes digged out of the ground, is as &s;trange as any, of which Pomponius Mela v&s;eth the&s;e very words: In Gallia Narbonen&s;is is the fountaine Sal&s;ula, which &s;hedeth water not &s;weet but more bracki&s;h than the water of the &s;ea. Hard by is a field all greene and couered ouer with &s;hort and &s;lender reeds, yet otherwi&s;e it &s;wimmeth and floteth aloft vpon a pole that beareth it vp. That it is &s;o, the middle part of it plainly prooueth, which being cut off from the re&s;t about it, &s;wimmeth like an Iland, and &s;uffereth it &s;elfe to be &s;houed and drawne to and fro.

<PB REF="269"> places al&s;o that are cut and digd quite through, appeareth the &s;ea &s;headed vnderneath it. Whereupon, whether it were through ignorance of the truth, or that they were purpo&s;ely di&s;po&s;ed to make a lea&s;ing, it liked is well our authours as al&s;o the Greeks, to leaue in writing vnto &s;uch as &s;hould come after, fi&s;h was digged out of the whole ground in that country, which indeed comming out of the deepe &s;ea thither, and there being, killed by &s;uch as bobbed for them, was drawen dead out of the afore&s;aid holes. This much out of him. Now whether Strabo and Athenaeus be to be numbred among&s;t tho&s;e Greeke writers, who&s;e credit Mela doth extenuate heerein, I know not. For Strabo in his 4. book de|liuereth, that about the riuer Ru&s;cino (in the very &s;ame prouince that Mela there de&s;cribeth) there is a lake not far from it, and a little farder off from the &s;ea a wateri&s;h fenny piece of ground, full of &s;alt pots, wherein are mullets, which are woont to be drawen and taken out of the earth. For as &s;oone as a man diggeth 3. or 4. foot deepe into the ground, thru&s;ting an eel-&s;peare into the mud, a man &s;hall &s;ometime chance to &s;ticke or kill the fore&s;aid fi&s;h, being of a rea&s;onable growth and bigne&s;&s;e. This kind of fi&s;h, like the eele, is bred and li|ueth in the mudde. Thus writes he. Athenaeus in his 8. booke, out of Polybius his 34. booke of hi&s;tories &s;aith thus: that from the Pyreney mountaines vntil you come to Narbon, the fields, all along through the wh ch the riuers Iliberis and Ru&s;cino do runne, be plaine and champion, in which fields are found tho&s;e fi&s;hes which they tearme fo&s;&s;iles, that is, digged out of the ground. For the &s;oile of that place is &s;oft and greene, much gra&s;&s;e growing thereon: vnderneath the gra&s;&s;e, the earth being for two or three cubites deepe &s;an|dy, you &s;hall find water that hath &s;oaked thither and i&s;&s;ued foorth out of the riuers, in which fi&s;hes doe wander through tho&s;e &s;treames for their food, being exceedingly delighted with the roots of the gra&s;&s;e. All that coa&s;t is full of fi&s;hes vnder the ground, which a&s;&s;oone as the earth is ca&s;t vp, they take. And D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">lechampius vpon Athenaeus hath ob&s;erued that this maner of fi&s;hing doth as yet in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hat place continue euen to this day. I haue beene alwaies of this mind, that that little hi&s;tory which Ari&s;totle hath left in writing in his booke of wonders may fitly be referred hither: how that in the borders of the Mar&s;eilles nere the Ligu&s;ticke &s;ea, there is a lake, which bubbling and &s;treaming foorth ca&s;teth out an infinit multitude of fi&s;hes, exceeding all beliefe &amp;c. Pliny in his 9. booke, chapter 17. &s;aith, that if in that &s;ea&s;on, when mullets v&s;e to ingender, in the prouince of Narbone, a man take a milter out of their pooles where they are kept, and draw a long &s;tring or line through the mouth and guils and &s;o tie it fa&s;t and then put him into the &s;ea, holding the other end of the line &s;till in his hand, if he pull him againe vnto him, he &s;hall haue a number of &s;pawners or females follow him hard at the taile to the bankes &s;ide. Semblably, if he do the &s;ame with the female in &s;pawning time, he &s;hall haue as many milters follow after her. In the very &s;ame prouince, after the &s;ame authour, is there a famous well named <HI>Orge,</HI> within the very head wherof grow certaine herbs, &s;o much de&s;ired and &s;ought for by kine and oxen, that to &s;eeke and get a mouthfull of them, they will thru&s;t in their whole heads ouer their eares, vntill they meet therewith. In another place of Pliny I read this following: There is a city of Gallia named Tungri, much renowmed for a noble fountaine, which runneth at many pipes: a waft it hath re&s;embling the ru&s;t of iron, howbeit this ta&s;te is not perceiued but at the farewell and when you haue done drinking only. this water is purgatiue and driueth away tertian agues, expelleth the &s;tone and cureth the &s;ymptomes attending thereupon: Set this water ouer the fire or neere vnto it, and you &s;hal &s;ee it thicke and troubled; but at the la&s;t it will become red. Moreouer this prouince, as it is de&s;cribed of S. Augu&s;tine in his booke <HI>De ciuitate Dei,</HI> hath a fountaine about Gratianopolis, or Grenoble, very like the holy well in Epyre, which, if you dip a burning torch therein, it pre&s;ently quencheth it, and if you hold it a good way off without any fire on it, of it owne nature kindleth it againe. Artimedorus is authour, that vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t of France there is a lake, which is called <HI>Lacus duorum coruorum,</HI> that is, the lake of the two crowes, in which he &s;aith two crowes were ordinarily to be &s;eene, each of them hauing their right wings white of colour. Hither repaire all tho&s;e that haue any matter in controuer&s;ie, and vpon a table &s;et on high, each party for him&s;elfe layth downe a cake. When the crowes flie thither, they deuour one cake, and the other they breake all to crums: but he obtaineth the cau&s;e again&s;t his aduer&s;ary, who&s;e cake is broken and ca&s;t downe. But Strabo iudgeth this hi&s;tory to be but a meere fable. Ari&s;totle al&s;o among&s;t his wonders reckoneth the high way called in his time <HI>Heraclea via,</HI> which is reported to haue reached from Italy euen to the Celto-Galles, or Celtiberi. On this way all pa&s;&s;engers whether Greekes or homeborne are carefully looked vnto, or guarded by the inhabitants, le&s;t any harme by mi&s;chance befall them in their iourney. For they in who&s;e borders the harme is done, are by law puni&s;hed or bound to make good the lo&s;&s;e. Vitrunius writeth, that in Mar&s;iles tiles are made, which being ca&s;t into the water do &s;wim and not &s;inke. I may now fitly among&s;t the&s;e wonders de&s;cribe that field which is called <HI>Campus lapideus,</HI> that is, Stondoun, or Stone-field. Geographers do place it betweene Mar&s;iles and the mouth of the riuer Rhone: Pliny calleth it the me|moriall of Hercules his battels: becau&s;e that Hercules in this place fighting again&s;t Albion &amp; Bergion the &s;ons of Neptune, and hauing &s;pent all his artillery, called vpon his father Iupiter, who powred downe a &s;hewre of &s;tones for his defence and aid: and a man would verily beleeue that it had rained &s;tones indeed, there lie &s;o many, heere and there, and tho&s;e &s;o farre be&s;pread euery way. This fable al&s;o is confirmed by Mela, Solinus, Higinus and Martianus: yet before them all I willingly preferre the opinion of Strabo, who de|&s;cribeth it: There is a plaine di&s;tant from the &s;ea about an hundred &s;tadia or furlongs, about &s;o much ouer from one &s;ide to the other, and it is in compa&s;&s;e round. It is of the euent called the &s;tony plaine. For it is full of &s;tones, as big as a man can gripe, vnderneath which groweth gra&s;&s;e, yeelding great &s;tore of pa&s;ture for cattell: but within the mid&s;t thereof there is water, &s;altpits and &s;alt. The whole region that bordereth vpon it vpwards, lieth open to winds: but vpon this plaine chiefly lieth and bloweth the violent and impetuous Northerne winde, wherewith, men &s;ay, &s;tones are hoi&s;ed vp and whirled in the aire and men blowen down out of waggons and with the force thereof &s;tript both of armour and apparrell. The &s;ame authour al&s;o bringeth this probable rea&s;on of Po&s;&s;idonuis, who &s;aid that it had &s;ometimes beene a lake, which when it was dried vp by rea&s;on of the conti|nuall to&s;&s;ing and drift of the water this way and that way, was thereby parted into many &s;tones, re&s;embling &s;omewhat tho&s;e pebble &s;tones on the banks of riuers, or &s;ea-&s;hoare ve|ry like one another in greatne&s;&s;e and &s;moothne&s;&s;e &amp;c. Ari&s;totle in his 2. booke of Meteors and 8. chapter affirmeth it to haue beene made &s;o &s;tony by an earthquake and nameth it the <HI>Phlegraean plaine.</HI> Diodorus de&s;cribeth the very &s;ame plaine (although not by the &s;ame name) together with the wind infecting it. The forre&s;t of Ardrine is heere al&s;o (in Belgica I meane) of which Tacitus, in his 5. booke of Annals, writeth thus: They &s;ought tho&s;e forre&s;ts, which were named <HI>Arduenna.</HI> Are there then many of this name? Can it be proued to be &s;o out of Pomponius Mela, becau&s;e that in one place he &s;aith that Gallia is plea&s;ant to behold by rea&s;on of many goodly great forre&s;ts? I cannot thinke it to be true: con&s;i|dering that in all old hi&s;tories (for as much as I know) there is mention made only of one wood or fore&s;t of this name. Notwith&s;tanding I am per&s;waded that it was &s;cattred both in length and breadth and happily one part di&s;ioined from another, yet all vnder one and the &s;elfe &s;ame name. For Cae&s;ar auoucheth it to be of a huge bigne&s;&s;e: and indeed euen the greate&s;t fore&s;t in all Gallia, as that which extendeth it &s;elfe from the riuer Rhine through the middle of the country of the Treuires vnto the entrance of the borders of Rhemes, and then declined towards the place, where the riuers Skeld and Maze meet together: &s;o that it was more than 500. miles in length. The&s;e 500. miles (allowing eight &s;tadia for a mile) do amount vnto 4000. &s;tadia, which number Strabo doth a&s;&s;igne it, but out of authours (as he &s;uppo&s;eth) not worthy to be beleeued, if that place of his be vncorrupt. For the learned Cau&s;a bonus, the glory of France, and honour of that his countrey, in his learned Commentaries vpon the &s;aid writer, &s;car&s;e thinketh the place to be without error. Neither doth it &s;eeme to me likely to be true, that Cae&s;ar, who was an ey-witne&s;&s;e of this fore&s;t, was ignorant of the mea&s;ure thereof. That Diana was &s;irnamed Arduenna of this fore&s;t, is proued out of an old monument of marble, whereof we &s;hal &s;peake more at large heereafter. And thus farre concerning the region. Now it followeth to treat of the people. Pau&s;inias maketh it a populous region: and Liuy, fruitfull of men. Polybius al&s;o in his 2. booke of ciuill wars, witne&s;&s;eth the &s;ame. For he writeth that Cae&s;ar &s;ubdued 400. diuers people of this realme of France. Iornandes &s;aith that they exceed the co~mon &s;tature of men. Their bodies according to Hirtius are to be maruelled at for their mighty lims &amp; great|ne&s;&s;e, and according to Ammianus they were tall of &s;tature. And that they are of exceeding talne&s;&s;e aboue other nations, it is apparant out of Cae&s;ar, when he &s;aith, that in re&s;pect of their owne talne&s;&s;e and goodly per&s;onages, all the Gauls for the mo&s;t part accompt the Romanes but very dwarfes. Moreouer that they were tall of &s;tature, tender and &s;oft fle|&s;hed, and very faire complexioned, Strabo plainly te&s;tifieth. That they were whitely coloured and &s;nowt-faire the&s;e words of Petronius vnto Gyrton do &s;eeme to approue, <HI>Increta facies, vt Gallia &s;uos ciues putet:</HI> Their faces were painted, that France might thinke them to haue beene French men borne. Namely, that by that meanes they might counterfet the naturall beauty and whitline&s;&s;e of the Gauls: and not, as my &s;ingular good friend, in that his mo&s;t learned and exact de&s;cription of England writeth, who thinketh that the Gauls were wont to cleare their faces to make them looke more beautified: which cannot be proued out of any ancient authour, if I do not forget my &s;elfe. And no maruell, &s;eeing that nature it &s;elfe hath voluntarily be&s;towed vpon them this beauty and whitene&s;&s;e. From hence it is, that the Poet &s;aith that the Gauls had <HI>Lactea colla,</HI> that is, white necks. That they did v&s;ually weare their haire long (for which cau&s;e one part of Gallia was termed <HI>Comata</HI>) I haue for my authours Strabo and Clemens Alexandrinus: as al&s;o Agathias, who writeth that it was an ordinarie cu&s;tome among&s;t the kings of France neuer to be cut or polled but to continue vn&s;hauen from their cradle to their dying day, and to haue their locks hang|ing trimly vpon their &s;houlders, with their haire before curiou&s;ly &s;headed, and falling downe vpon either &s;houlder. This their haire Liuy deliuereth to haue beene long and yellow. Diodorus &s;aith it was naturally reddi&s;h, and yet they augment this colour by art. For according to Leopardus the interpreter in his emendations they wa&s;hed their haire continu|ally with a lie made of chalke and turned it vp from the forehead toward the crown and noddle, to the end that they might be con&s;picuous and eminent, and that their looke might &s;eeme to be mo&s;t like to Panes and Satyres. They likewi&s;e made their haire &s;o thicke, that it differed nothing from the manes of hor&s;es. Was this the rea&s;on then that Claudian happily &s;aith <HI>Gallia crine ferox,</HI> that is, The Frenchman grim of countenance by rea&s;on of his long haire? Pliny affirmeth that &s;ope was an inuention deui&s;ed by the French for to co|lour the haire of their head yellow: in &s;omuch that Claudian &s;aith, that the Frenchmen haue <HI>aureos vertices,</HI> that is, yellow heads: and Virgil &s;aith, they haue <HI>aureas cae&s;aries,</HI> that is, golden lockes. To this purpo&s;e al&s;o are tho&s;e words, which Tertullian v&s;eth in his booke <HI>De cultu Foeminarum,</HI> that is, of the ornaments of women, where he deliuereth that &s;ome of them did v&s;e to colour their haire with &s;affron. To the very like rea&s;on Ammianus calleth the French <HI>Candidos &amp; rutilos,</HI> whiti&s;h and ruddy, borrowing their denomination from their skin and haire. I read in Liuy that they all weare long beards. Diodorus &s;et it them out in their true colours, thus. Some &s;aith he, &s;haue their beards, other &s;ome let them grow, although not ouer long. The gentle men and noblemen &s;haue their cheekes, but they &s;uffer their beards to grow on their chin &s;o long, vntill they couer their bodies. Whereby it commeth to pa&s;&s;e, that when they eate, they are euery foot full of crummes and meat: and when they drinke, the drinke will run down as it were through a pipe or channel. They v&s;e all meanes that can inuent, that they grow not too fat and gorbellied: and if any yong man exceed the pre&s;cript and &s;et mea&s;ure of his girdle, he is (as Strabo recordeth) amer|ced for it. And &s;o much concerning their outward forme and fauour. Now it remaineth to &s;peake &s;omewhat of their nature and di&s;po&s;ition, whereof becau&s;e no writer is more skilfull for knowledge and more ancient for writing than Cae&s;ar; take the&s;e his words, as they lie &s;cattered heere and there in &s;undrie places of his Commentaries: The coun&s;els &s;aith he, of the Gauls be ha&s;ty and &s;udden: in their con&s;ultations they be variable and for the mo&s;t part de&s;irous of alteration. This is a common cu&s;tome among them, to compel euen wayfaring men to &s;tay whether they will or no, and to enquire what newes any man either hath heard, or knoweth of any matter what&s;oeuer. And the common people v&s;e to come flocking about the merchants in cities and do vrge them to tell out of what countries they come, and what things they know of there. And being moued with the&s;e light re|ports and heare&s;aies, they fall to coun&s;ell oftentimes euen of mo&s;t weighty matters: whereof they mu&s;t needs repent them by and by after, &s;eeing they are &s;o fondly led by vncer|taine rumours, and &s;eeing al&s;o that diuers per&s;ons do tell them forged newes to feed their fancies withall. Thus farre Cae&s;ar. Moreouer of the&s;e people we may read the very &s;ame things almo&s;t in Polybius, Oro&s;ius, Trebellius and Vopi&s;cus. But this peculiar cu&s;tome of theirs, which they haue in their councels and a&s;&s;emblies, is not to be omitted, which is (as Strabo reporteth) thus: if &s;aith hee, any man among them with noi&s;e or other tumult troubleth him that is &s;peaking, the &s;ergeant commeth vnto him with a naked &s;word or knife in his hand, and commandeth him to hold his peace, threatning him therewith: thus he doth three times, and then if the party holdeth not his peace, and be not quiet, he cutteth off &s;o much of h s ca&s;&s;ocke, that all the re&s;t &s;halbe good for no v&s;e at all. Diodorus and Strabo affirme them to be &s;harpe witted, and not without &s;ome &s;mattering know|ledge of learning: So likewi&s;e doth Symmachus, who commendeth their &s;tudies in good lettets. Polybius more maliciou&s;ly bent again&s;t them is not a&s;hamed to &s;ay that they nei|ther apply them&s;elues to learning nor to any maner of trade. But now heare what Hirtius reporteth of them: They be plaine dealing men, and no way deceitfull, they v&s;e to fight their battels by prowe&s;&s;e and not by treacherie. Likewi&s;e Strabo thus commendeth them: they be of an hone&s;t di&s;po&s;ition, without fraud or guile, and no whit malicious or &s;pite|full. Is it not for this cau&s;e thinke you, that of the &s;ame authour in another place they are called <HI>Simplices,</HI> &s;imple? of Seruius, <HI>Pigrioris ingenij,</HI> of a dull wit? of Firmicus, <HI>&s;tolidos,</HI> foo|li&s;h? of Iulian, <HI>Stupidos &amp; ru&s;ticitatem amantes,</HI> blocki&s;h and affecting a certaine kind of clowni&s;hne&s;&s;e? But on the contrary &s;ide, hearke what Lucius Florus writeth: Let no man only cal the French fierce or &s;tout; for they are crafty fellowes and can do what they entend, very politickely. Is this fal&s;ly? Or is it true, and likely that they learned it afterwards of the Romanes? Who (as Trogus recordeth) had &s;ent Seruilius into Africa and had giuen him a priuy charge, if by any meanes he could, to make away Hanniball through the helpe of tho&s;e, who mo&s;t of all enuied his greatne&s;&s;e. But neither was this true, being improued by Iulian the Emperour, that was an eie-witne&s;&s;e, and daily conuer&s;ant among&s;t them, and therefore the rather in this ca&s;e to be beleeued, who not only after the afore&s;aid Florus, but al&s;o after all ancient writers what&s;oeuer, giueth this commendation of them: to wit, that they know not how to Hatter: they liue hone&s;tly and &s;imply without deceit or di&s;&s;imulation with all men, according to the lawes of iu&s;tice and equity: they only intertaine Venus, the godde&s;&s;e of marriage, for wedlocke and i&s;&s;ue; and Bacchus, the authour of mirth, that they may haue a &s;ufficient competency of wine to drinke. Aelian reporteth that of all men liuing they are the readie&s;t to vndergo dangers: Florus &s;aith, that they be <HI>Immani&s;&s;imos,</HI> mo&s;t &s;auage: Cicero and Eumenus, <HI>Immanes &amp; barbaros,</HI> cruell and barbarous: Lucane, Trogus and Hege&s;ippus, <HI>Feroces,</HI> fierce: Auienus and Seneca, <HI>Truces,</HI> &s;tern or grin: Ca&s;&s;iodorus, <HI>Crudeles,</HI> cruell: Lucan, <HI>Sanguineos,</HI> bloudy: Lampridius &s;aith that they haue <HI>Duras &amp; retrogradas mentis,</HI> hard and back&s;liding fal&s;e harts. Vopi&s;cus affirmeth that they be, <HI>Gentium omnium inquieti&s;&s;imos,</HI> of all nations the vnquiete&s;t: Liuy and Polybius, <HI>Molles &amp; effoeminatos,</HI> delicate and effeminate and the &s;ame Polybius in another place, faithle&s;&s;e and giuen much to &s;urfettings and drunkenne&s;&s;e; which &s;ame thing al&s;o Diodorus Athe|naeus and Clemens Alexandrinus doe confirme to be true. The afore-cited Liuy &s;ayth, that they are exceedingly prone to anger, which this nation is not able to bridle or mode|rate, and withall they are very couetous. Mela writeth that they be proud and &s;uper&s;titious: Silius, <HI>Vaniloquos,</HI> vaine bablers and Plutarch in his Pyrrhus, that they are exceeding co|uetous of money. Such like prai&s;es hath this nation, but all of them proceeding from a deadly &s;ore, and therefore let them approoue and iu&s;tifie the truth of the&s;e their a&s;&s;ertions. Neuerthele&s;&s;e there be extant, among&s;t other, the&s;e two examples of their cruelty: the one of them in T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ogus, who writeth that in their warre and fight again&s;t Antigonus, when by diuination by the inwards of bea&s;ts offered in &s;acrifice, their vtter de&s;truction and ouerthrow was foretold; they not ca&s;t into any amazement or feare, but rather rapt with furie and madne&s;&s;e, killed their wiues and children, beginning the hopefull &s;ucce&s;&s;e of this warre with a mo&s;t vnnaturall murder &amp;c. The other example you may &s;ee in Lucius Flo|rus, who deliuereth that &s;ome of them taken pri&s;oners in battell, did a&s;&s;ay to bite and gnaw atwo the chaines they were bound withall, and that they did cut one anothers throats. Vnle&s;&s;e a man would rather thinke that the&s;e were proofes and examples of their loue of liberty. For both Oro&s;ius and Leo the Emperour haue left in writing that this people is mo&s;t de&s;irous of liberty. Notwith&s;tanding Pau&s;anias in his Phocicam, &s;heweth their great valour in that battell at Thermopilae. I cannot but woonder in my mind at Marcus Victorinus, who calleth the&s;e men da&s;tards, cowards and &s;uch as put more tru&s;t in their heels than in their hands, whom Claudian calleth couragious; and Salu&s;t, warl ke, pui&s;&s;ant, mighty in armes and feats of warre before the Romanes. Or doth this Victorinus happily interprete thus the&s;e words of Cae&s;ar? As their courage is forward and ready to enterpri&s;e and begin warre, &s;o haue they womani&s;h and faint harts to &s;uffer and endure calamities? or the&s;e of Liuy? In the fir&s;t on&s;et or a&s;&s;ault the Gauls are more &s;tout than men, but at la&s;t they are more faint-harted than women: or the&s;e words of the &s;ame authour? Often v&s;e hath proued this to be true; If you can endure and &s;u&s;taine the fir&s;t on&s;et, which they make in hot bloud and de&s;perate fury, their bodies faint with &s;weat and wearine&s;&s;e, &s;o that they are not able to beare vp their weapons &amp;c. or this in like maner of Flo|rus? It hath beene found true by experience, that like as their fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault is more than mens, &s;o their la&s;t are le&s;&s;e than womens.</P>
<PB REF="269">
<P>They agree in this one property with the &s;now of their country: for a&s;&s;oone as they are hot in battell, pre&s;ently they &s;weat extremely. And if they &s;tirre ne|uer &s;o little they melt like &s;now in the Sunne. Or, this of Dion? The Gauls are carried with vn&s;atiable lu&s;t to performe all matters what&s;oeuer they go about, in &s;o much that they know no meane either of boldne&s;&s;e or of feare, but one while they fall of a &s;udden from boldne&s;&s;e into fearefulne&s;&s;e; and by and by from feare into de&s;perate ra&s;hne&s;&s;e. Or this iudgement of Strabo which he giueth of them? It is a warlike and fierce nation, very forward in fight. Therefore being pro|uoked to battell they fight vpon heapes thronging together and do lie very open: and that very vncircum&s;pectly. Whereby it commeth to pa&s;&s;e that they are ea|&s;ily entrapped, it their enemy v&s;ing but &s;ome &s;tratageme, at his be&s;t aduantage, doe traine them out to ioine battell, being appointed and armed with nothing be&s;ide &s;trength and de&s;peratene&s;&s;e. Leo the Emperour in his booke <HI>De Bellico apparatu,</HI> determineth of them farre otherwi&s;e. The Frenchmen (&s;aith he) are &s;tout of courage, valiant in warre. To be faint harted and to giue ground neuer &s;o little they account a great di&s;grace, and do e&s;teeme it no better than running a|way &amp;c. Now then if this nation be &s;o womani&s;h and cowardous, &s;o vnpatient of labour, &s;o vncon&s;tant and vnable to hold out in battell, doe but tell me (O thou Romane) why Cicero in his oration <HI>Pro Prouincijs Con&s;ularibus,</HI> did write that this Gallia was &s;o terrible vnto thee? Why did Salu&s;t affirme that all Italy did tremble and quake for feare of this people; in &s;o much, that the Romanes did not v&s;e to contend with them for glory and ambition, but only for &s;afegard of their liues and country? How happeneth it, that in Trogus we find the&s;e words of the kings of the Ea&s;t? There was &s;o great a terrour of the French name, and of their &s;ucce&s;&s;e in all warres &s;o pro&s;perous; that the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elues neuer able to keepe either their maie&s;ty out of danger, nor to recouer it againe, being decai|ed or lo&s;t, without the helpe of the French valour and prowe&s;&s;e. And why doth Appian, in his &s;econd booke of Ciuill warres, &s;ay, that they did &s;trinke &s;uch a ter|rour to the Romanes, that in the law, wherein freedome from &s;eruice in warre was granted to Prie&s;ts and old men, the French warres were only excepted? So|&s;ipater, out of Varro his &s;econd booke of Antiquities, gathereth, that the Gauls did mo&s;t ingeniou&s;ly affect two things, to wit, militarie knowledge, and elo|quence. From hence is that of Iuuenal: <HI>Gallia ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> potius nutricula can&s;idicorum.</HI> Whether France &s;hould France intituled be or Lawyers nur&s;e I know not certainly. Item in another place: <HI>Gallia cau&s;idicos docuit facunda Britannos.</HI> The prating Frenchmen fir&s;t did teach, The Engli&s;hman to plead at barre. Was this true in Iuue|nals time? or did he rather prophecie of times to come? For this mi&s;ery our nation neuer felt till the daies of William the Fir&s;t. Columella in his fir&s;t booke of Husbandrie &s;aith, that <HI>Sine cau&s;idicis &s;atis felices olim fuere futurae&abque; &s;unt vrbes.</HI> Saint Ambro&s;e, in his Epi&s;tle vnto Ru&s;ticus, highly extolleth the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;tudies of France; and the copiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the French tongue; and Claudian in his fourth Panegyricke of the con&s;ul&s;hip of Honorius, commendeth the learned inhabi|tants of France. Concerning their warefare take the&s;e few things gathered out of ancient writers: and fir&s;t out of Cae&s;ar. This is the maner of the Gals (&s;aith he) when they begin any warres they appoint a generall mu&s;ter, to which by a common law, all the yong &s;triplings are compelled to come in their armour: and he that commeth la&s;t of all, is in the open &s;ight of all the re&s;t, with all kind of mo&s;t cruell torments, put to death. Out of Strabo: Their armour according to their &s;tature is a long &s;word hanging on the right &s;ide, along target, &s;peares &s;utable thereunto (which Diodorus reporteth to bee headed with iron, a cubite or &s;ome|what more in length, and little le&s;&s;e than two handfuls broad) and a kind of iaueling called <HI>Meris,</HI> or rather, as &s;ome learned men do affirme, <HI>Materis,</HI> and to bee the &s;ame with that kind of weapon which Cae&s;ar calleth <HI>Matara.</HI> Some of them al&s;o v&s;e bowes and &s;lings. They haue moreouer another weapon of wood in forme of a dart, which they fling not with a thong fa&s;tned to the middle, [as the Iri&s;hmen at this day v&s;e] but meerly with the bare hand, &amp; yet for all that they will throw it further than an archer can &s;hoote. Nonius out of Varro maketh mention of a kind of weapons, proper to the Frenchmen, called <HI>Ge&s;a,</HI> in the&s;e words: <HI>Qui gladijs cincti &s;iue &s;cuto cum binis ge&s;is.</HI> That is, which were armed with &s;words and bucklers with two Ge&s;aes. Concerning them al&s;o Virgil writeth thus: &mdash; <HI>Duo Qui&s;&abque; Alpina corru&s;cant Ge&s;a manu.</HI> Two Ge&s;es weapons which the Frenchmen v&s;e to brandi&s;n did ech party chu&s;e. Seruius in his Comments vpon this place doth interprete them, <HI>Ha&s;tas viriles,</HI> manlike &s;peares: and addeth moreouer that valiant &s;ouldiers were woont to bee called in the French tongue <HI>Ge&s;i.</HI> But it ought in|deed to be written with <HI>ae</HI> the dipthong, <HI>Gae&s;a:</HI> (of which you may &s;ee what we haue deliuered in the old mappe of Spaine, or M. Clarencieux Camden his Bri|tannia, where hee hath learnedly handled this argument, and for this word, among&s;t the re&s;t, &s;hall &s;atisfie thee to thy fill.) From hence, it may bee, it is that a kind of people there were named <HI>Gae&s;ati,</HI> becau&s;e they did weare and v&s;e the&s;e Ge&s;es. Touching which I haue written more at large in my The&s;aurus. The fore&s;aid authour affirmeth that their hor&s;emen be better than their footmen: and that the&s;e hor&s;emen did v&s;e to come to the field with many carts and great car|riages. Liuy al&s;o and Pomponius Mela do deliuer that they skirmi&s;h in chariots and waggons. The &s;ame likewi&s;e doth Strabo affirme of them, but that he cal|leth the&s;e waggons, <HI>E&s;&s;eda,</HI> which is all one. Out of the&s;e charriots (&s;aith Diodorus) they fir&s;t throw a dart at their enemy comming again&s;t them: then after|ward for&s;aking their chariots they fight on foot with their &s;words. I do vnder&s;tand out of Vegetius that in skirmi&s;hes they did v&s;e to fight in troupes and &s;euerall bands containing in number &s;ix thou&s;and armed men apiece. <HI>Cateruas,</HI> he calleth them: Of which word, as al&s;o of <HI>E&s;&s;edum,</HI> &s;ee M. Camdens Britannia. They were naked all aboue the nauill, &s;aue only that they couered their bodies, although very meanly god woot, with a long target, which was not broad inough for the largene&s;&s;e of their bodies, as Liuy and Polybius do te&s;tifie. Likewi&s;e Gauls were <HI>Scutis protecti corpora longis:</HI> &s;hielded their bodies with long targets, as Virgil reporteth. The&s;e targets being about the heigth of a man in length, were, as euery man thought fit, adorned with certaine formes and pictures of liuing creatures, embo&s;&s;ed and &s;omewhat bearing out higher than the &s;urface of the target it &s;elfe, as Diodorus writeth: who addeth in another place that they defended or ar|med their heads with a bra&s;en helmet higher then ordinary, wherein were ingrauen either hornes or portraitures of birds or bea&s;ts. The &s;ame authour witne&s;&s;eth that they v&s;ed trumpets in their warres. Their &s;words &s;aith Polybius, were heauy; and very long, as Liuie writeth, and without points, as Strabo telleth vs: made onely for this purpo&s;e, that they might wound the enemie with downe-right blowes: whereupon Virgil, (as Seruius noteth) writeth, <HI>Alt&egrave; con&s;urgit in en&s;em,</HI> that is, he lifteth vp his &s;word on high to giue the greater blow: with which if they did hit, they cut off the heads of their foes at one &s;troke. Yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;words were made without art and of a &s;oft kind of iron, as Polyaenus affirmeth in his eigth booke. Wherefore of the&s;e &s;ame weapons thus gathereth Sui|das out of Polybius. They are &s;o made that at the fir&s;t on&s;et they giue one blow, and then pre&s;ently are &s;o crooked and bended both in length and breadth, that vnle&s;&s;e you grant them &s;pace immediately to retire and to &s;trengthen them with their feet, the next &s;troke can do no hurt. Diodorus termeth them <HI>Spathae,</HI> and &s;aith that they hang by a bra&s;en chaine on the right &s;ide. Neuerthele&s;&s;e Iulius Pollux commendeth this French &s;word, calling it by the Greeke name <HI>(machaera.)</HI> Polybius, Strabo and Diodorus do teach that they wore about their neckes gold chaines, (which gaue occa&s;ion to Virgil to &s;ay &mdash;<HI>Lactea colla Auro innectuntur</HI>&mdash;. Their lilly white neckes adorn'd with gold.) and about their armes and hands, co&s;tly bracelets: and tho&s;e among&s;t them that were in place and authority, did weare garments died and garded with gold, (<HI>Atque aurea ve&s;tis,</HI> golden garments the French did weare, &s;aith Virgil.) They did adorne, &s;aith Pliny, and &s;et out their &s;words, &s;hields, and head-peeces with corall. Some of them al&s;o &s;aith Diodore, gilded their iron brea&s;t-plates. When they go to battell there is among them &s;uch &s;inging, howling, &s;howting, dancing, &s;uch noi&s;e of targets, which they &s;hake after their countrie fa&s;hion and the fearefull clattering of armour &s;o great, that all places round about did &s;eeme to ring therewith, as Polybius and Liuy do iointly te&s;tifie. Strabo al&s;o and Diodorus affirme, that they did fight again&s;t the enemie with dogs. Moreouer they carried with them to the wars (if we may beleeue Po&s;&s;idonius in Athenaeus) para&s;ites, whom they would haue to &s;ing &s;ongs in their honour and commendation: and indeed the &s;ame thing is auouched by Diodorus. If they haue got the vpper hand of their enemies in battell, they are woont to &s;acrifice their captiues vnto their Gods, as Athenaeus, vpon the te&s;timonie of So&s;ipater verilie thinketh. When they returne from battell, (heere what Strabo reporteth of them) they hang the heads of their enemies vpon the manes of their hor&s;es and &s;et them vp vpon the towne gates, to be viewed and &s;eene of of all men. But the heads of Noblemen, (heare Diodorus) embalmed with &s;pices, they lay vp in ca&s;es with the greate&s;t care that may bee; &s;hewing them to &s;trangers, and will not part with them, either to their parents or to any other their friends, for any money. Liuy writeth, that they did offer vp in triumph, the &s;poiles of dead bodies, and the head being cut off from the body, in their temple, which is held in greate&s;t reuerence among&s;t them. Afterward, the head being clean&s;ed, as their maner is, they gild the skull, and that they e&s;teeme for an holy ve&s;&s;ell, wherein they drinke at &s;olemne fea&s;ts and &s;acrifices. And this is the cup of the Prie&s;ts and rulers of the temple. Whereupon Silius writeth thus: <HI>At Celtae vacui capitis circumdare Sueti O&s;&s;a (nefas) auro &amp; men&s;is ea pocula &s;eruant.</HI> But this vile cu&s;tome do the Celtes ob&s;erue The heads from carca&s;e of their foes to pull: Which &s;et in gold mo&s;t curiou&s;ly they carue, And in &s;teed of cuppes doe quaffe in dead mens &s;cull. Of the ordering of their Hor&s;e battell which they call <HI>Trimarci&s;ia,</HI> read Pau&s;anias in his Phocica. Likewi&s;e of their <HI>Silodunes,</HI> as Athenaeus, or <HI>Soldures,</HI> (&s;ouldiers) as Cae&s;ar termeth them, reade the&s;e aforenamed authours, and, if you plea&s;e, ad vnto them tho&s;e things which Leo the Emperour hath writ|ten in his eighteenth booke <HI>De Bellico apparatu,</HI> in the eighty and eight &s;ection. Now it remaineth that we &s;peake &s;omething al&s;o of their common maner of liuing. Throughout all Gallia, (&s;aith Cae&s;ar) there be but two &s;orts of men, that are made account of, and had in any great e&s;timation; the one are the <HI>Druides,</HI> the other are their <HI>Knights.</HI> The&s;e knights (of the Druides we haue &s;poken at large in our mappe of Gallia de&s;cribed by Cae&s;ar) when need is and when any warre chanceth, giue them&s;elues altogether to feats of armes. And among them, as any man is of greate&s;t birth and ability, &s;o hath he about him more &s;eruants and retainers. The Druides are occupied about holy things: they haue the charge of publike and priuate &s;acrifices; and do interpret and di&s;cu&s;&s;e matters of religion &amp;c. For the communalty is kept vnder in maner like &s;laues: and the noble men may lawfully deale with them in all points as with their &s;laues. They do not &s;uffer their &s;ons to come in their pre&s;ence openly, vntill &s;uch time as being men growen, they be able to &s;upply the roomes of &s;ouldiers: and they count it a &s;hame, that the &s;onne as long as he is a boy, &s;hould be &s;eene abroad in his fathers company. Looke how much money the men do receiue with their wiues in name of their dowry, they make an e&s;timate of their owne goods and lay &s;o much in valew thereunto: all the which is occupied together in one &s;tocke, and the increa&s;e thereof is re&s;erued, and which of them &s;oeuer ouerliueth other, the &s;tocke with the encrea&s;e of the former yeares falleth to the &s;uruiuer. The men haue ouer their wiues, like as ouer their children, authority of life and death, &amp;c. Thus much wee haue collected out of the &s;ixth booke of Cae&s;ars commentaries, where thou mai&s;t reade of many other things to this purpo&s;e, well worth the ob&s;eruation. Diodorus Siculus affirmeth that their women are very goodly per&s;onages, and for bigne&s;&s;e of bone and &s;trength, little inferiour to the men: they are very fruitfull and good nources, or, as Strabo reporteth very good breeders and bringers vp of children. They, as Plutarch in the eigth booke of his Sympo&s;ion, writeth, did v&s;ually bring, when they went to the bath to wa&s;h them&s;elues, together with their children and little ones, the skillet and pappe wherewith they v&s;ed to feed them. A notable example of their worth and valour, thou &s;halt find in his booke of vertues, where hee &s;heweth that it grew into a cu&s;tome among&s;t them, that both for matters at home in time of peace, and abroad in time of warre, they v&s;ed the coun&s;ell and adui&s;e of their wiues, and what&s;oeuer was done it was partly done by their appointment. Polyaenus al&s;o in his &s;euenth booke reporteth the very &s;ame thing of them. Notwith&s;tanding that their women are mo&s;t beautifull, yet, as Athenaeus and Diodorus do both affirme, they are much giuen to buggery and to loue boies be|yond all mea&s;ure. But whether this be true or not I cannot tell. I would rather beleeue that it was not generally affirmed of all the Gauls; but rather &s;pecially of tho&s;e which did inhabite that part of the countrey which was called Gallia Braccata, where the Ma&s;&s;ilyans, a people de&s;cended from the Greekes, did dwell, who&s;e wantonne&s;&s;e, and effeminate maners, tho&s;e adagies or prouerbes cited by Suidas, <HI>Ma&s;&s;iliam venis,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;&s;iliam nauiges</HI> do manife&s;tly reproue for this fault. Hither al&s;o I do referre that which I haue read in the ninth booke of Clemens his Recognitions, &s;poken as I &s;uppo&s;e vpon this very &s;ame occa&s;ion: There was an ancient law or cu&s;tome among the Gauls, &s;aith he, which did ordaine that to a new married man boies &s;hould be giuen openly and in the &s;ight of all the compa|ny, which was accounted no maner of &s;hame or di&s;hone&s;ty among&s;t them. And I verily thinke that Strabo &s;pake of this their v&s;age, in the&s;e his words: It was held for no maner of vn&s;eemely thing among&s;t them, if they did commit buggery with yong men of one or two and twenty yeares old. Of the Celtae al&s;o this &s;aying of Stobaeus is not to be omitted: where he writeth, that it was a more hainous crime &amp; offence among&s;t the~ more &s;euerely puni&s;hed, if one did kil a &s;tranger, than if one &s;hould kill one of his owne countrey men: for this was but bani&s;hment, the other was death. But was not this thinke you a law only again&s;t &s;uch mur|thers as were committed in via Heraclea? Their apparrell they did ordinarily weare, as Strabo te&s;tifieth, was a kind of ca&s;&s;ocke &s;omewhat like the Spani&s;h cloake (<HI>Saga</HI> it is called of the Latines) of which Virgil in the&s;e words maketh mention, <HI>virgatis lucent &s;agulis:</HI> Trimme they &s;hine in &s;trip'd rugs: They were wouen of a cour&s;e kind of wooll, and were called in their language <HI>Laenae,</HI> (yet the iudicious Ca&s;aubone in his learned commentaries vpon this place of Strabo, thinketh that the place is corrupt, and that we ought rather to reade <HI>Chlenas,</HI> than <HI>Laenas</HI>) They did al&s;o weare breeches, (<HI>braccae,</HI> they call them) &s;et out and bumba&s;ted, or loo&s;e, as Lucane &s;aith. In &s;teed of coates they v&s;ed a &s;lit &s;leeued garment which came downe to their twi&s;t and buttockes: and as Martiall &s;aith <HI>Dimidia&s;&abque; nates Gallica palla tegit:</HI> A curtalled pall the Gauls did weare, that &s;carce would hide their taile. This kind of garment is &s;till in v&s;e heere in the Low countries, made in the very
<PB REF="270"> &s;elfe &s;ame forme and fa&s;hion and is called in our language a <HI>Pallatrocke;</HI> for <HI>Rocke</HI> with the Flemings, is a&s;much as <HI>Ve&s;tis</HI> in Latine, a weed, or ve&s;ture. Ari&s;totle in the &s;euenth booke of his Politickes, in my iudgement, &s;peaketh of this kind of garment, when he &s;aith that the Gauls did weare a kind of &s;hort gabbardine. The forenamed Martiall doth &s;peake of a kind of weed v&s;ed among&s;t the Gauls which he calleth <HI>Bardocucullus Santonicus,</HI> The hooded cloake of Xantoigne. But Pliny be&s;ide the&s;e, maketh mention of another kind of ve&s;ture v&s;uall among&s;t them, in the&s;e his words: Wooll of it &s;elfe, driuen together and wrought in maner of a felt, doth make a knid of cloath: and if in the making of it, you do worke it with vineger, it will be &s;o &s;tiffe and &s;olide that you &s;hall not be able to pierce it with the &s;troake of a &s;word: this I thinke was fir&s;t inuented by the Frenchmen. The &s;ame authour reporteth that the&s;e people did fir&s;t make that cloth that is damasked with &s;cutcheons or loze~ge-work. In I&s;idorus, out of Plautus the&s;e words are cited, <HI>Linnae cooperta e&s;t textrino Gallia.</HI> For the &s;e~&s;e of which I refer to the author him&s;elf, for the copies of I&s;idorus are here very corrupt. Diodorus Siculus &s;aith that they did v&s;e to weare rings vpon their fingers: yet Pliny reporteth that they wore them only vpon the middle finger. Cae&s;ar te&s;tifieth that they tooke plea&s;ure in oxen, and &s;uch kind of labouring bea&s;ts. Now in like maner we will &s;peake &s;omewhat of their diet and maner of liuing. They v&s;ed in their &s;eruices earthen ve&s;&s;els, very thicke and &s;trong, and goodlily &s;et out with flowres. At &s;upper they generally all of them &s;it, not vpon &s;tooles, but on the ground vpon woolues skinnes or dogges skinnes &s;pread vpon the &s;ame. Strabo &s;aith that at their meat they &s;it vpon beds or pallades lying vpon the ground. They are &s;erued at their tables with little boies. Hard by them is the fire, where the pots with boiled meats hang &s;ee thing, and &s;pits full of roa&s;t meat are continually going, as Diodorus reporteth. Their meats for the mo&s;t part are porke and bacon; yea and &s;ometime they eate anie other kind of fle&s;h what&s;oeuer, and that oft times is dre&s;&s;ed with milke, as Strabo hath left recorded. But Athenaeus words, which hee citeth out of Po&s;idonius, are worth the noting: The Celtae make their drinkings vpon tables of wood, with a little hay &s;trowed vnderneath; the&s;e tables be not very high from the ground. They haue bread, (which, as Pliny writeth, they make light with leauen) but of it they haue no great quantity: their meat is a great deale of fle&s;h &s;odde in water, broiled vpon the coales, or roa&s;t vpon &s;pits. This, when it is brought to the boord, they take vp whole in both their hands, and like rauening lions doe teare it with their teeth: but if there be any of it &s;o tough that they cannot ea&s;ily gnaw it, that they cut in &s;maller pieces with a little knife. Their bankets they v&s;e to furni&s;h with all kind of fi&s;h, both fre&s;h-fi&s;h, &s;ea-fi&s;h, and &s;hel-fi&s;h, what&s;oeuer kind, I meane, that either the fre&s;h riuers, or bracki&s;h &s;eas do affoord. The&s;e they broile and dre&s;&s;e with &s;alt, vineger and cummin &s;eed, which things al&s;o they v&s;e to put into their pots. If many do meet at one table together, they &s;it round in maner of a circle. The be&s;t man alwaies &s;itteth in the midde&s;t: him I terme the be&s;t man, that either for martiall prowe&s;&s;e, nobility, or wealth doth excell the re&s;t. The &s;eruitoures, skinkers, or &s;uch as do waite at the boord, do carrie drinke to the table in pots like pitchers, either of potters mettall, or el&s;e of cleane &s;iluer. Of the &s;ame mettall are their di&s;hes and platters, in which they &s;erue in their meat. Yet &s;ome of them haue them of bra&s;&s;e: other &s;ome in &s;teed of platters do v&s;e ba|skets, made of twigs or o&s;iers. The wealthier &s;ort do drinke wine brought from Italy, or from the country neere about Mar&s;eilles, and that for the mo&s;t part is of the pure grape, yet &s;ometime they allay it or brew it with a little water: <HI>dercoma,</HI> they call it. They &s;uppe it vp by a little and little out of the &s;ame cuppe, being euery foot &s;ipping and bibbing. A boy carrieth about the pot in both his hands. But Pliny te&s;tifieth that they made a kind of drink, of &s;teeped corne, &s;o &s;trong that it would make a man drunke. Diodorus Siculus writeth that they had a kind of drinke, which they call <HI>Zythum,</HI> (we now cal it <HI>Ale,</HI> the Britans as Dio&s;corides te&s;ti|fieth called it <HI>Curmi,</HI> or <HI>Curw</HI> as now the Welchmen pronounce the word.) Item the &s;ame authour &s;aith that they made another kind of drink of the water wherein they had wa&s;hed or &s;od hony combes, (this now we call <HI>Mead:</HI>) yea and Ammianus Marcellinus &s;aith that they did make and inuent euery day many new kinds of drinke in de&s;pite of wine, to counterfet it &s;o neere as they could. I reade al&s;o in Diodorus Siculus that they did v&s;e to eate mans fle&s;h. But whether is this to be vnder&s;tood of their enemies fle&s;h only, and of &s;uch as they ouercome in battell? For that they did thus at the field fought at Thermopylae, Pau&s;anias doth flatly affirme. Or, whether do you thinke that he &s;o &s;pake of them in regard that they &s;acrificed men vnto their gods? For this was done, as Pliny reporteth, in &s;uch &s;ort, that it was &s;omwhat like as if they had gnawen them. Notwith&s;tanding in Sextus Rufus we reade of the Scordi&s;ci Galli, that they v&s;ed to drinke mans bloud, out of the skuls of their enemies which they had conquered in the field. Moreouer Diodorus writeth that they v&s;ed to bid &s;trangers &amp; trauellers to their tables, &amp; after &s;upper or dinner then to ask what they are, wherfore they come, whence they are, and whether they will. They v&s;ed al&s;o when they had filled their bellies, fal|ling into talk vpon any argument as occa&s;ion &s;hould offer it &s;elf, to fal out, and &s;o to ri&s;e and challenge one another into the fields, no whit re&s;pecting their liues or limmes: and that in this manner, as Po&s;idonius in Athenaeus reporteth: They being armed, &s;aith he, challenge one another to fight aloofe, cla&s;hing onely the points of their &s;words, neuer comming neere there by the length of their weapons, as if they were afraid to hurt one another: yet notwith&s;tanding &s;ometime it falleth out that one of them is hurt; and then except the &s;tanders by doe part them, and keepe them a &s;under, they will not giue ouer till it hath co&s;t one of them his life: whereupon peraduenture Horace &s;aid, <HI>Non pauentis funera Galliae,</HI> And de&s;perate France that fear'th no death. In old time al&s;o it was an ancient cu&s;tome among&s;t them, that when the quarters and ioints of mutton were &s;et vpon the table, the &s;tronge&s;t and talle&s;t man of them would take the legge, which if &s;o be any other would challenge as due to him, and would offer to take it out of his hand, it mu&s;t co&s;t one of them his life. Others do take vp in the theater gold, or &s;iluer, or a certaine number of hogges-heads of wine: and a&s;&s;oone as they haue bound them&s;elues with an oath that they will endure that, for which they had receiued the&s;e gifts: then taking them, and di&s;tributing them vnto their mo&s;t inward and deare&s;t friends, they &s;tretch them&s;elues out &s;traight vpon their backes, and lay them downe vpon their &s;hields, one &s;tanding by that is to &s;tabbe them in their throat and cut off their necke with a &s;word. They lie downe to &s;leepe on gra&s;&s;e or ru&s;hes &s;trowed vpon the ground, as Polybius te&s;tifieth: or vpon deares skinnes, as Diodorus recordeth. In the thirteenth booke of Athenaeus, where you &s;hall find the&s;e words, in my iudgement, &s;poken of Braccata Gallia, (They lie vpon skins betweene two Ganimedes:) For I am verily per&s;waded, and I thinke all wi&s;e men with me, that he meant the Grecians of Mar&s;eilles, and not the true and ancient Gauls who&s;e maner it was, as before we haue noted out of Iulian the Emperour, that they v&s;ed that act only for the procreation of children. Their hou&s;es and habitations, &s;aith Cae&s;ar, for the mo&s;t part were in woods, or vpon the bankes of brookes and riuers, thereby to &s;helter them&s;elues from the violence of the Sunne, and heat of Sommer: and tho&s;e, Vitruuius writeth, were made and couered ouer with oken &s;hingles, or el&s;e with &s;traw. Strabo affirmeth that they are built in a maner round, of planks and hardles, couered with a great roofe, made taper-wi&s;e or &s;ugar loafe fa&s;hion: this roofe, as Pliny writeth, was of &s;tubble. Their gates, if we may beleeue Nicolaus in Stobaeus, did continually &s;tand open. Iulianus the Emperour, in his Mi&s;opogonus, relateth a tale, whereby we gather that they had the v&s;e of hot-hou&s;es or &s;toues, &s;uch as &s;till to this day are v|&s;ed in &s;ome places of this countrie. Villages they haue, as Polybius noteth, without any wals or rampart for defence again&s;t the a&s;&s;ault of the enemies: For Tro|gus reporteth that they learned of them of Mar&s;eilles, to enclo&s;e their townes with wals and ramparts. The maner of building and fa&s;hion of which wals thou mai&s;t vnder&s;tand out of the &s;euenth booke of Cae&s;ars commentaries: where moreouer thou &s;halt find this that followeth: when any great or notable mat|ter falleth out they giue notice of it through the fields and countries by lowd cries or proclamations one vnto another, and &s;o &s;till forwards, like vnto our hue and cries, vntill it &s;tay at the outmo&s;t border of the kingdome. Ammianus in his fiue and twentieth booke &s;aith that they gaue them&s;elues much to &s;wimming. In hunting, as I gather out of Cornelius Cel&s;us, they were woont to &s;trike the deere with a venomed arrow. Item Aulus Gellius out of Pliny citeth the&s;e words of the &s;ame argument: The Gauls when they went on hunting, were woont to dippe their arrow heads in the iuice of hellebore, verily beleeuing that the fle&s;h of &s;uch deere as were &s;troken and killed with them, was farre more tender than otherwi&s;e it would be: but by rea&s;on of the venome of the hellebore, they &s;ay they did v&s;e to cut off round about, a great deale of the fle&s;h where the arrow went in. Item Pliny al&s;o maketh mention of the hearb <HI>limeum,</HI> wherewith they made a kind of ointment, which they call <HI>venenum ceruarium,</HI> Hart-poi&s;on, with which in hunting they do be&s;meare their arrowes. Ari&s;totle in his <HI>Admiranda,</HI> &s;heweth that among&s;t the Celtae there is a kind of poi&s;on found, called by them <HI>Toxicum,</HI> (the Latine interpreter did read <HI>Xenicum,</HI> that is, &s;trange) which infecteth and kil|leth &s;o &s;peedily, that the hunters of that country when they haue &s;tricken a deere with an arrow dipped in the iuice of this herb, they runne with all &s;peed, and do pre&s;ently cut out all that fle&s;h neere round about where the arrow went in, le&s;t the venome &s;preading it &s;elfe further and further, the whole deere &s;hould putrifie and &s;o be marred and good for nothing &amp;c. Pliny maketh me beleeue that this confection or poi&s;on was made of the yeugh-tree (<HI>taxus,</HI> they call it) where hee &s;aith that tho&s;e poi&s;ons, which we now call <HI>toxica,</HI> wherewith they did be&s;mere their arrowes, were &s;ometimes called <HI>taxica.</HI> Of the poi&s;on and venemous na|ture of the yeugh-tree, we haue entreated before. But there was a tree which grew among&s;t the Celtae much like vnto a figge-tree, who&s;e fruit that it bare, was fa&s;hioned like vnto the chapter of the Corinthiacke pillar. This fruit being cutte doth yeeld a iuice, wherein if any man &s;hall dippe his arrowes, what&s;oeuer hee &s;hall &s;trike therewith, will pre&s;ently die of that wound, as Strabo affirmeth from the report of others. That the Gauls did not feare the danger of Earth-quakes, Ari&s;totle and Plutarch do plainlie te&s;tifie. But whether it be true or fal&s;e, I dare not affirme. Another notable example (except one &s;hould thinke it to be a feined and forged tale) of great boldne&s;&s;e or rather of de&s;perate ra&s;hne&s;&s;e, I find in Aelianus his <HI>varia hi&s;toria,</HI> which is thus: They do account it, &s;aith he, &s;o fowle and &s;hamefull a thing to flie or runne away, that oft times they will make no ha&s;t to get from vnder hou&s;es that they &s;ee are ready to fall vpon their heads, nay they will hardly out of tho&s;e hou&s;es that are on fire, &s;o that many times they be burnt to a&s;hes in the flame. Many of them al&s;o will &s;tand &s;till vntill the waues and tide of the &s;ea do runne quite ouer them. Moreouer &s;ome of them will ca&s;t them&s;elues into the &s;ea in their armour, and with their &s;words drawne, and &s;haking of their &s;peares, daren the tide, as if they could either fraie or wound the &s;ame. Let the credulous Iew beleeue this, if he will, I beleeue neuer a word of it, although I know that Stobaeus, and before him Nicolaus, did verily beleeue it all to be true. Heere I do by experience find, that &s;aying of Pliny to be very true, that There is hardly any greater di&s;paragement to the truth, than when a fal&s;e told is told by a graue authour. But may not one thinke, that I may requite one tale with another, that this was that &s;ight, which Lucian in his Apologia writeth, that his friend Sabinus went as farre as the We&s;t ocean to &s;ee? Their funerals according to their maner and &s;tate are very gorgeous and co&s;tly: all things that the dead men in their life time did e&s;pecially loue and affect, yea euen &s;uch liuing creatures as they be&s;t e&s;tee|med, were ca&s;t into the fire and burnt: and not long &s;ince, within the memory of our forefathers, euen their &s;eruants and followers, whom they loued extraor|dinarily well, when all ceremonies of the funerall were done, were ca&s;t into the fire and burnt together with their Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; thus Cae&s;ar reporteth of them. To this Pomponius Mela addeth, That with the dead they burne and burie in the ground all things that they commonly v&s;ed when they were aliue: their accoumpts and debts were deferred till doomes day. Some there were of them which would willingly ca&s;t them&s;elues into the fires and graues of their friends, verily per&s;wading them&s;elues that they &s;hould &s;till liue together with them: Item Diodorus Siculus reporteth, that &s;ome of them would ca&s;t into the fire where their friends decea&s;ed were burnt to a&s;hes, their letters, verily beleeuing that they would reade them there: For that opinion of Pythagoras, of the immortality of the &s;oule, had taken footing and deepe root among&s;t them: being per&s;waded that afterward, the bodies being dead, in proce&s;&s;e of time they &s;hould againe returne into other bodies. Li&s;ten al&s;o what Valerius Maximus &s;aith of this matter: It was an ancient cu&s;tome &s;aith he, among&s;t the Gauls, as old records do verifie, v&s;u|ally to lend money in this world, to be paid againe in the world to come. Which the forenamed authour termeth <HI>Philo&s;ophiam foeneratoriam,</HI> A couetous or mi|&s;erly kind of Philo&s;ophie, practi&s;ed then by &s;ome v&s;urers. But can you tell where now a man may borrow an hundred pounds, vpon good &s;ecurity, till that day? I doubt whether there be any pale-faced cut-throat v&s;urer, glorious &s;mooth-tongued gold-&s;mith, crafty mocke-lawyer Scriuener, or any rag-merchant broker, in this our city, that was euer Pythagoras &s;choller. This Iewi&s;h &s;ect are all, I thinke by their practi&s;e, of the opinion of the Sadduces, who thought and taught that there was no re&s;urrection of the &s;oule to be expected after this life. It is no wonder or &s;trange matter to thinke that the Gauls were of this opinion, if &s;o bee that be true, that one Alexander in Clemens Alexandrinus doth tell of, namely, that Pythagoras did trauell into France. Tertullian out of Nicander doth write that they v&s;ed to he abroad all night vpon the graues and tombes of valiant men: and there to expect the an&s;weare of &s;ome of oracle. I care not an halfe penny for that opinion of the great Orateur Tully, in that his oration which he made for Marcus Fonteius, where he writeth that The Gauls are hardly addicted to follow any religion at all: For Liuy, although in other things he be partiall and dealeth hardly with this nation, yet he plainly affirmeth that they be not very backeward in religion: And Cae&s;ar, in his &s;euenth booke of the warres of France, who throughly well knew this people, &s;aith, that they were much giuen to religion, and &s;eruice of &s;ome god or other. Item he &s;aith, That they did e&s;pecially wor&s;hip god Mercury, of whom there were among&s;t them many images and &s;tatues, they affirming him to be the authour and inuentour of all arts and &s;ciences: him al&s;o they hold to be their guide and leader in all iourneies and waies through which they are to trauell: him they &s;uppo&s;ed to haue a great power and &s;troke in all maner of trafficke and gainfull trade for money: to him they offered mans fle&s;h in &s;acrifice, as Minutius Felix writeth. Be&s;ides him they did al&s;o wor&s;hip Apollo, Mars, Iupiter and Minerua. Of the&s;e their gods they held the very &s;ame opinion,
<PB REF="270"> that other nations of the world did: viz. That Apollo being praied vnto, did driue away all di&s;ea&s;es. Minerua fir&s;t taught the grounds of all arts and occupations: Iupiter, did rule and moderate the motion of the heauens: Mars, was pre&s;ident and guardian of the warres: That the Celtae did honour Iupiter, who&s;e image or &s;tatue was a mo&s;t goodly tall oake, Maximus Tyrius doth plainly te&s;tifie. Of Mercury heare what Pliny in the &s;euenth chapter of his fowre and thirtieth doth write: Zenodorus, &s;aith he, in our time did in the city Clermont or Auvergne (<HI>Aruerniae,</HI> the ancients called it) make the greate&s;t and mo&s;t gorgeous &s;tatue that euer was made in the world: who there for tenne yeares together working vpon the &s;tatue of Mercury, had for his hire H S. CCCC. that is, as &s;ome men reade it, fowre hundred thou&s;and &s;e&s;tertioes; which do amount in our money to 3333. pounds, &s;ixe &s;hill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs and eight pence. Strabo doth te&s;tifie that Diana, the E|phe&s;ian Godde&s;&s;e, had a temple at Mar&s;eils. Item, Polyaenus witne&s;&s;eth, that the French-greekes <HI>(Gallo-graeci)</HI> did wor&s;hip Diana: which Plutarch, in his booke of the Fortitude of women, doth auouch to be true. But be&s;ide this Diana, they wor&s;hip another by them &s;irnamed <HI>Arduenna,</HI> as is verified by an ancient in&s;crip|tion in marble, of which we &s;hall &s;peake more anone. This godde&s;&s;e by all probability &s;eemeth to haue beene wor&s;hipped in the forre&s;t Arduenna. For although it be there written DEANAE ARDVENNAE, yet I thinke there is no man meanly &s;eene and trauelled in ancient in&s;criptions, that is ignorant that by it is meant <HI>Dianae Arduennae:</HI> For the ancient Romanes did oft times v&s;e <HI>I,</HI> for <HI>E,</HI> and contrariwi&s;e <HI>E,</HI> for <HI>I,</HI> as the learned can beare me witne&s;&s;e. And in honour of her was this forre&s;t Arduenna con&s;ecrated and made holy, or rather as I thinke heere was &s;ome temple erected and dedicated to her &s;eruice, built either by the an|cient Gauls, &s;o deuout and religiou&s;ly giuen, as before is &s;hewed, or, if you like that better, by the Romanes them&s;elues, as in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t renowmed fore&s;t or wood within the compa&s;&s;e of their whole Empire, a place mo&s;t worthy and be&s;t be&s;eeming this godde&s;&s;e. And what maruell I pray you? being, I &s;ay, a place mo&s;t fit and conuenient for this godde&s;&s;e Diana, to inhabite and make her abode in? For &s;he is called of all ancient heathen writers <HI>Venatrix, Nemoralis, Nemorum &amp; &s;yluarum Dea, virgo &amp; cu&s;tos;</HI> The godde&s;&s;e of hunting, the godde&s;&s;e of the woods, cha&s;es and fore&s;ts; and the maiden keeper of the &s;ame: Lactantius, Lucane and Minutius Felix do affirme that they had three gods which they in their language called <HI>E&s;us,</HI> or <HI>He&s;us, Teutates,</HI> and <HI>Taranus:</HI> But the learned, for the mo&s;t part, by them do vnder&s;tand Mars, Mercury and Iupiter: See M. Camdens Britannia. In Au&s;onius there is mention made of a god of theirs which they na|med <HI>Belenus:</HI> whom Herodian, by the iudgement of the learned Iulius Scaliger, calleth <HI>Belis:</HI> And whether this be the &s;ame with <HI>Tibilenus,</HI> whereof Tertullian maketh mention, Petrus Pithaeus in his Aduer&s;aria doth mo&s;t learnedly di&s;pute; and doth there interprete it to be the &s;ame that Apollo is to the Greekes. More|ouer <HI>Abellio</HI> was one of their gods, as the forenamed Scaliger, at the &s;ame place, out of an ancient in&s;cription, doth teach vs. The &s;ame authour al&s;o maketh men|tion of <HI>Onuana,</HI> a godde&s;&s;e of theirs. Saint Au&s;ten, in his bookes of the city of God, doth affirme that they had certaine vncleane &s;pirits or diuels, called by them <HI>Dusij,</HI> in the catalogue and number of their gods. But whether they did wor&s;hip the god <HI>Serapis,</HI> (the &s;ame peraduenture with Pluto) the aboue-mentioned P. Pi|thaeus, out of certaine words, of the &s;ixteenth booke of Ammianus Marcellinus his hi&s;tory, doth in the third chapter of his Aduer&s;aria, at large and learnedly di|&s;cour&s;e: to whom I referre thee for farther &s;atisfaction. Out of Florus al&s;o we learne that they wor&s;hipped <HI>Vulcane</HI> for a god: who writeth that they did promi&s;e to giue him the armour and weapons of the Romanes their enemies. Athenaeus &s;aith that they turned their faces toward the right-hand when they did their &s;er|uice to their gods. Of this matter, Plinie in the &s;econd chapter of his eight and twentieth booke, writeth thus: In wor&s;hipping of the gods wee offer to ki&s;&s;e the right hand, and withall we wind and &s;way about the whole body: which the Gauls did hold to be more religious, if it were done toward the left hand. To the&s;e they did offer in their &s;acrifices, men and other things, but e&s;pecially vnto Mars, as Cae&s;ar te&s;tifieth, who thus writeth of them: To him, (namely to Mars) when they haue fought any battell, for the mo&s;t part they do bequeath tho&s;e things that they haue wonne in the field: tho&s;e bea&s;ts and liuing creatures that they conquere and take they kill and offer them for &s;acrifice: all other things what&s;oeuer they bring into one place: In diuers cities, in certaine holy and con&s;e|crated places, you may &s;ee great heapes of the&s;e things: and you &s;hall hardly euer find any man &s;o backward in religion or &s;o vngodly, that either will hide and conceale &s;uch things as he hath gotten in the field, or that will dare to take away ought that hath beene once con&s;ecrated and laid vp in tho&s;e &s;acred and religious places: and if &s;o be that any man be either &s;o prophane, or hardly that dareth take ought away, he is to bee puni&s;hed, by their lawes, with mo&s;t cruell tortures. Diodorus Siculus reporteth the very like of them, They doe keepe, in the chappels and temples of their gods, &s;aith he, great &s;tore of gold, which hath from time to time beene offered to them, lying &s;cattering heere and therein euery corner: and yet no one man for his life, (&s;uch is their great &s;uper&s;tition) dareth bee &s;o bold as to touch one piece of it. But Cae&s;ar goeth on forward in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e: They, &s;aith he, which are &s;icke or much di&s;ea&s;ed, and &s;uch as are in any great danger, or are to follow the warres, for their &s;acrifices do either kill and offer other men, or el&s;e doe vow hauing obtained their purpo&s;e to &s;acrifice them&s;elues: and in the&s;e their ceremonies they doe v&s;e the adui&s;e, direction and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Druides: And this they doe for this rea&s;on: namely, for that they doe verily beleeue that for the life of man pre&s;erued, the immortall gods can no way be &s;atisfied and plea&s;ed but with the life and bloud of man: And therdfore for that pur|po&s;e they haue certaine &s;acrifices appointed to be publickly &s;olemnized and done. Others haue certaine images of an huge and mighty bigne&s;&s;e: who&s;e limmes and parts of the body, being made of o&s;iers wreathen and roddled one within another, they fill full of liue men; the&s;e images being &s;et on fire, the men within them are &s;moothered and at length with them burnt and vtterly con&s;umed to a&s;hes. The death and puni&s;hment of &s;uch as are apprehended for murther, or fello|ny, or any other odious crime, they thinke to be much more plea&s;ing to the gods, than the death and &s;acrifice of other men: but when there do want a &s;ufficient number of &s;uch wicked men to furni&s;h this tragedy, then hone&s;t guiltle&s;&s;e men mu&s;t be forced to play a part, and to vndergoe that puni&s;hment that they neuer de|&s;erued. Thus farre Cae&s;ar. The &s;ame almo&s;t, but much different in words, Strabo doth write of them: Some, &s;aith hee, in their diuine ceremonies they &s;hoot through with arrowes, or el&s;e doe hang them vp by the neckes till they be dead: and then making an huge colo&s;&s;us or &s;tacke of hay, and &s;ticking vpright a long pole in the mid&s;t of it, they burne altogether, &s;heepe and all kind of bea&s;ts and cattell, yea and rea&s;onable creatures, men and women. Item Diodorus Siculus writeth of this matter thus: Condemned men, which they keepe for the &s;pace of fiue yeares together continually bound to a &s;take, at length together with other goods and cattels they &s;acrifice and burne in an huge bonne-fire. Minutius Felix al&s;o doth te&s;tifie, that to their god Mercurie they did v&s;e to &s;acrifice men. Ter|tullian in Apologetico, &s;aith, that <HI>Maior aetas, Mercurio pro&s;ecatur,</HI> The ancienter &s;ort are hewed in pieces and &s;acrificed to Mercury. So, that, it had beene much better for the Gauls, as Plutarch in his booke of Super&s;tition, writeth, that they had neuer had any maner of knowledge of the gods at all, then to haue beleeued that they might no otherwi&s;e be plea&s;ed and &s;atisfied, then with the liues and bloud of mortall men: and to thinke that this is the be&s;t and only &s;olemne &s;acrifice and oblation that euer was v&s;ed by any. Solinus al&s;o plainly affirmeth that this kind of &s;acrifice and dete&s;table cu&s;tome, was no maner of wor&s;hip and &s;eruice plea&s;ing to the gods, but rather a great iniurie and wrong done to religion, much offending them. This cu&s;tome of killing of men, was not v&s;ed only when they offered &s;acrifices to their gods, but euen in their diuinations and &s;orceries. For they tooke tho&s;e men that were appointed for the &s;acrifice or ceremonies, and &s;triking them vpon the backe, by the panting of their bodies, they did ge&s;&s;e and diuine of the euent of that action intended, as Strabo doth witne&s;&s;e of them. When they do deliberate or con&s;ult of any great matter, they do ob&s;erue, &s;aith Diodorus, a woonderfull and &s;trange kind of cu&s;tome and ceremonious &s;uper&s;titi|on. For going about to kill and &s;acrifice a man they &s;trike him vpon the midriffe with a &s;word. But without the aduice and pre&s;ence of one of their Druides, they may not offer any maner of &s;acrifice at all. And although that the&s;e butcherings and ma&s;&s;acres of men were forbidden by Tiberius Cae&s;ar, as Pliny te&s;tifieth, yet Eu&s;ebius in his fourth booke de Praepar. Euang. doth greatly lament that they were &s;till practi&s;ed in his time, who liued, as all men know, in the daies of Con&s;tan|tine the Great. It is recorded by Pliny, that the&s;e people did v&s;e, in their &s;orceries, coniurations and an&s;wering to demands in maner of prophe&s;ying, the hearb verueine. And thus much of the three Galliaes in generall. Of which thou mai&s;t reade many other things in Cae&s;ar, Liuy, Ammianus, Strabo, Diodorus, Poly|bius and Athenaeus. Something al&s;o might haue beene &s;aid of euery part particularly, if &s;o bee that the &s;malne&s;&s;e of this &s;heet, had beene capable of &s;o large a di|&s;cour&s;e: as al&s;o much might haue beene &s;aid of Gallia Narbonen&s;is, the fourth part, which was a prouince of the Romanes, much differing from the other three in nature of &s;oile, temperature of the aire, and quality of the inhabitants and people; which was, as Pomponius Mela writeth, better manured, inhabited, and more fertile, and therefore was al&s;o a farre more plea&s;ant and goodly countrie than any of the re&s;t. But of this we haue &s;poken in another place, apart by it &s;e&s;fe. Behold the in&s;cription, which we &s;pake of before, and promi&s;ed to acquaint thee withall. DIS. MANIBVS. Q. CAESIVS. Q. F.

<HEAD>IVLIVS CAESARS GALLIA: That is, FRANCE, as it &s;tood in Iulius Cae&s;ars <HI>time.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_SO I intitle this Mappe: For it is merely <HI>Cae&s;ars,</HI> that is, portraitured and drawen only by that which he hath layd downe in his Commentaries: we haue not added one word or any one place out of any other author: neither haue we, to our knowledge, omitted any place there mentioned by him: Thus much I thought good to aduerti&s;e thee of, gentle Reader, le&s;t in vaine thou &s;houlde&s;t in this Map &s;eeke for tho&s;e things which other ancient writers haue written of <HI>Gallia.</HI> Of the nature of the country &amp; people there inhabiting, I will not in like maner, which otherwi&s;e I v&s;e to do, adde to the&s;e any one word out of any other wri|ter: becau&s;e euery one that li&s;teth may do this out of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> alone, which is an authour very common, and to be found ordi|narily in euery &s;cholars &s;tudy. For why &s;hould I do this out of others, when as the Map is only framed out of him? But in &s;ted of this I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e here to compo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e following of the <HI>Druides,</HI> &s;elected out of all ancient hi&s;torians.</P>
<P><HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in his &s;ixth booke of the warres of <HI>France</HI> hath left recorded, that in <HI>France</HI> there were two &s;orts of men which were in e&s;timation and credit aboue the common &s;ort: One of the&s;e, &s;ayth he, were the <HI>DRVIDES,</HI> the other were the <HI>KNIGHTS, (Equites.) Strabo</HI> nameth the&s;e three, the <HI>Bardi, Vates</HI> (Prophets) and <HI>Druides:</HI> like as <HI>Lucane</HI> doth in the&s;e ver&s;es, <HI>Laudibus in longum VATES dimittitis aeuum: Plurima &s;ecuri fudi&s;tis carmina BARDI: Et vos Barbaricos ritus mor&eacute;m&abque; &s;i|ni&s;trum Sacrorum DRVIDAE &amp;c.</HI> You <HI>Vates</HI> graue, of worthy men long tales do tell: For rymes and ver&s;e you carele&s;&s;e <HI>Bardi</HI> eke do beare the bell. Of barbarous rites in things diuine you holy <HI>Druides</HI> write &amp;c. <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> affirmeth the &s;ame, but that tho&s;e which <HI>Lucane</HI> calleth <HI>Vates,</HI> he nameth <HI>Eubages. Diodorus Siculus</HI> maketh mention of the <HI>Bardi</HI> &amp; <HI>Druides</HI> only; but the latter &s;ort he calleth <HI>Saronides,</HI> by another &amp; diuers name, yet of the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and &s;ignification. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;eemeth often times to terme them generally by one name <HI>Magi. Lucianus</HI> in <HI>Hercules Ogmios</HI> calleth them <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> So much of the name: now &s;omewhat of the per&s;ons them&s;elues. The <HI>KNIGHTS, (equites)</HI> &s;ayth <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> when need requireth, and any occa&s;ion of warre falleth out, do all go to warfare: and euery one of them, as he is of greater birth or reuenues, &s;o he hath a greater retinue and number of &s;er|uants attendant vpon him. Other honour and dignity than this they know none. The <HI>BARDI</HI> are Poets, as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> ioyntly te&s;tifie, and did v&s;ually &s;ing &s;ongs and hymnes made in the commendations of famous and worthy men. They are mu&s;icall Poets, which do &s;ing to the harpe or other in&s;tru|ments of mu&s;icke, &s;ongs to the prai&s;e and commendations of &s;ome, and to the di&s;prai&s;e and di&s;grace of others. <HI>Fe&s;tus Pompeius</HI> al&s;o affirmeth that the&s;e men did v&s;ually &s;ing ballads made in commendations of the valiant acts of worthy men; and withall he &s;aith that <HI>Bardus,</HI> in the Gauls language, &s;ignifieth a Singer. <HI>Marcellinus</HI> of the&s;e Poets &s;peaketh on this maner: The <HI>Bardi</HI> did v&s;e to &s;ing to the harpe, in very &s;weet &amp; plea&s;ant tunes, &s;ongs compo&s;ed in heroicall ver&s;e, of the valiant acts of martiall men. In <HI>Strabo</HI> I ob&s;erue that the&s;e are called <HI>Vates,</HI> (Prophets) and did v&s;e to offer &s;acrifice, and to &s;tudy naturall philo&s;ophy. <HI>Ammianus</HI> (who termeth them <HI>Eubages</HI>) writeth thus of them: The&s;e men &s;earched deeply into the &s;ecrets of Nature, and laboured to lay them open and plaine. The learned <HI>Petrus Pithoeus</HI> thinketh that all the&s;e words, <HI>Bardi, Vates, Eubages, Semnothei,</HI> and <HI>Saronides,</HI> are but &s;ynonymes of the <HI>Drui|des.</HI> And for that I &s;ee what&s;oeuer of diuers writers are attributed to all the&s;e &s;euerally, doe agree to that one of the Druides only, (as is very apparent by that which followeth) I am ea&s;ily drawen to be of his opinion.</P>
<P>The <HI>DRVIDES</HI> therefore or <HI>Druidae,</HI> (for in good authours I finde it thus diuer&s;ly written) were, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;aith, Philo&s;ophers and Diuines. <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;ayth that their di&s;cipline and maner of learning was fir&s;t found out and inuented in <HI>England,</HI> which al&s;o <HI>Tacitus</HI> in the <HI>14</HI> booke of his Annals &s;hew|eth and auoucheth to be true, and withall affirmeth that from thence it was tran&s;lated into <HI>France,</HI> and that they that de&s;ired to be more skilfull in the &s;ame, for the mo&s;t part went thither to &s;choole to be better in&s;tructed. But let vs de&s;cribe them out of <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> owne words, for no man hath done it more plainly, no man knew them better: They are pre&s;ent at diuine &s;eruice, they prouide the &s;acrifices both publike and priuate, they expound the articles of their religion and do &s;hew the v&s;e of their ceremonies: To the&s;e great troups of youth, of all &s;orts, do flocke from all quarters, to be in&s;tructed in any matter of learning: the&s;e men are greatly e&s;teemed and honoured of all men; for they doe end and determine almo&s;t all maner of controuer&s;ies, both priuate and publike: what&s;oeuer is committed ami&s;&s;e again&s;t right and rea&s;on, whether it be of any murther that is done, or of any quarrell ari&s;ing about any title of inheritance, &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or bounds of land betweene neighbour and neighbour, they do decide the controuer&s;ie; they do &s;et and appoint all rewards and boones for &s;uch as haue de&s;erued well of the &s;tate, and likewi&s;e puni&s;hments for &s;uch as are malefactours, and haue in ought offended the law. If there be any man what&s;oeuer, whether it be one priuate man, or a whole multitude and &s;ociety, that will not &s;tand to their arbitrement, they pre&s;ently &s;u&s;pended him from their &s;acrifices: this puni&s;hment amongst them is e&s;teemed the greate&s;t that may be inflicted vpon any man. They v&s;e not to follow the warres, neither do they pay cu&s;tomes and &s;ub&s;idies as o|ther men do. They are freed and priuiledged from the warres, and from any impo&s;ition and taske what&s;oeuer. Whereupon (moued thereto by &s;o many great inducements, liberties and immunities) many of their owne heads do go to them to &s;choole, others are &s;ent thither by their parents and kinsfolke: there they are &s;aid to learne &amp; con by heart an infinite number of ver&s;es; &s;o that &s;ome of them do &s;tay at &s;choole twenty yeres at lea&s;t, before they can attaine to the height of that knowledge. Neither do they hold it lawfull to commit tho&s;e things to writing, when as almo&s;t in all other matters, both in priuate and publike bu&s;ine&s;&s;es they do v&s;e the Grecke letters. This they &s;eeme to me, to haue done for two cau&s;es: Fir&s;t for that they would not haue that kind of learning to be made common and to come into the hands of the vulgar &s;ort: Secondarily, becau&s;e they would not haue tho&s;e which learne, to tru&s;t too much to their bookes, and &s;o by that meanes not to regard their memories &s;o much as they ought to do: for indeed for the mo&s;t part it falleth out, that tho&s;e which relie too much vpon the helpe of their booke, do learne more loo&s;ely and negligently, and withall do dull and greatly weaken their memories. This is the fir&s;t thing that they would beat into their &s;cholars heads, namely, That the &s;oules of men are immortall; that they do not die together with the body, but that after death they do pa&s;&s;e from one to ano|ther: and this they thinke to be a great inducement (by neglecting the feare of death) to moue their minds to follow vertue and true magnanimity. Moreouer they di&s;pute of, and teach to the yong frie, their &s;cholars, many things of the &s;tarres and their motion; of the compa&s;&s;e and greatne&s;&s;e of the world and earthly globe; of the nature of all things vnder the cope of heauen; and of the might and power of the immortall gods. Thus far <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> But for thy farther in&s;tru|ction, we will to the&s;e adioine that which other men haue written of the &s;ame. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> thus &s;peaketh of them: The&s;e men do profe&s;&s;e them&s;elues to know the compa&s;&s;e of the world and greatne&s;&s;e of the earthly globe; the motions of the heauens and radiant &s;tarres both fixed and planetary: yea to know what the gods them&s;elues do know and do. They teach the nobility, and better &s;ort of men of their nation, many things for twenty yeeres together, &s;ecretly in caues or thicke woods and fore&s;ts. One thing, of all other that they haue taught them in &s;ecret, is blazed abroad amongst the common people; namely, to make them the more fit for the warres; That the &s;oules of men are immortall, and that there is another life after this amongst the gho&s;ts. In <HI>Marcellinus</HI> I reade this of them: The <HI>Druidae,</HI> men of more lofty &s;pirits and deepe conceits, much addicted to brother like meetings, are giuen to the &s;tudy and &s;peculation of hidden and high matters: and contemning the world, do peremptorily affirme that the &s;oules of men are immortall. <HI>Diogenes La&euml;rtius</HI> writeth that they v&s;ed to vtter their opinions of the my&s;teries of their arte very ob&s;curely in few words and &s;hort &s;entences: <HI>videlicet:</HI> That God is to be wor&s;hipped: That we ought to doe nothing that is euill: and, That we mu&s;t exerci&s;e our &s;elues in feats of armes and true fortitude. But let vs heare what <HI>Strabo,</HI> in the fourth booke of his Ge|ography, reporteth of them: The <HI>Druidae,</HI> &s;aith he, be&s;ide their earne&s;t &s;tudy of naturall philo&s;ophy, do di&s;pute many things of the Ethicks or morall vertues. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="5 letters">en had a reuerend opinion of them for their &s;euere iu&s;tice: in&s;omuch that both priuate and publike execution of iu&s;tice was committed to them alone: yea and &s;ometime two armies being in the field ready to ioyne battell, they haue by their mediation made peace betweene them: but e&s;pecially the ca&s;es of mur|ther are committed to their cen&s;ure. And being found true by experience, that they haue alwayes the greate&s;t crops and &s;tore of fruits, they do verily beleeue, that the&s;e men can obtaine at Gods hand plenty and fertility at their plea&s;ure. The&s;e, and al&s;o the other, haue determined, that the &s;oule of man, and the hea|uens or world, are both immortall: yet &s;o as that the time &s;hall come, that &s;ometime the fire and &s;ometime the water &s;hall haue the victory and vpper hand. Out of <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> take this ob&s;eruation of them: They do moreouer v&s;e &s;ooth&s;ayers, which, &s;aith he, amongst them, foretelling things to come by di|uination and &s;acrifices, are of great e&s;timation and account, all the vulgar &s;ort and common people being at their obedience and command. When they con&s;ult of any great matters, they do ob&s;erue a very wonderfull and &s;trange cour&s;e: for they, for that purpo&s;e killing a man, do &s;trike him with a &s;word vpon the mid|riffe; and by his fall tearing and &s;cattering of the parts of his body, and running of the blood, by a certaine old experiment and ob&s;eruation, do know what will fall out hereafter. It is an ancient cu&s;tome duely kept amongst them, that no &s;acrifice may be done without the pre&s;ence of a Philo&s;opher: for they doe thinke that &s;acrifice ought only to be done by &s;uch as well knew the nature of heauenly things: as if the&s;e were indeed the true and be&s;t interpreters of the heauenly language v&s;ed of the gods them&s;elues: and by their interce&s;&s;ion and mediation they deeme all good things to be &s;ought and demanded at Gods hand. By their adui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e and coun&s;ell, they do all things that are done, either in war or time of peace. Of this their &s;laying of a man, the forenamed <HI>Strabo</HI> in the &s;euenth booke of his Geography maketh m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ntion where he calleth them <HI>Vates.</HI> Poets are amongst them of &s;uch account, that when the field is pitcht &amp; their &s;words drawen, hauing ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> armies are ready to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ome to handy blowes, not only their friends, but euen al&s;o their enemies and the aduers part, at their intreaty and meditation do leaue off fighting, and will not off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">r to &s;trike one &s;troke more.

Thus far <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> Now let vs in like maner li&s;ten to <HI>Dion Pru&s;aeus,</HI> who thus reporteth of them: The <HI>Cel|tae</HI> haue their <HI>Druides,</HI> a &s;ort of men amongst them much giuen to diuination and the &s;tudy of Philo&s;ophy, without who&s;e aduice and coun&s;ell it is not lawfull for their kings to doe ought, yea or once to goe about to con&s;ult what is be&s;t to be done: &s;o that if a man &s;hould indeed &s;peake that which is trueth, they rule as kings, and beare all the &s;way: when as their kings are but the &s;eruants, mini&s;ters, or executioners of their will and plea&s;ure, although otherwi&s;e they &s;it in golden thrones, dwell in great and &s;tately hou&s;es, and dayly fare mo&s;t daintily, and eat and drinke of the be&s;t that may be bought for money. Here al&s;o it is not ami&s;&s;e to alledge that of the Poet <HI>Lu|cane: Et vos barbaricos ritus morem&abque; &s;ini&s;trum Sacrorum Druidae po&s;itis repeti&s;tis ab armis. Solis no&s;te Deos, &amp; coeli numina vobis, Aut &s;olis ne&s;cire datum. nemora alta remotis Incolitis lucis, vobis autoribus vmbrae Non tacitas Erebi &s;edes, Diti&s;que profundi Pallida regna petunt, &amp;c.</HI> Ouer all the&s;e Druides, as <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> te&s;tifieth, there is one that is placed as chiefe, and hath a command and authority ouer the re&s;t: after his death, if any man amongst them excelleth the re&s;t for his worth and vertue, he is by and by cho&s;en to &s;ucceed in his place: but if there be many that are of equall value and dignity, then he is elected by the grea|ter number of voices of the Druides a&s;&s;embled together for that purpo&s;e. Sometime the controuer&s;ie is &s;uch as they fall to blowes about, and that &s;ouereignty is tried by dint of &s;word. They, once a yeere, vpon a certaine time, in the confines of Chartraine or Chartres <HI>(Carnutes)</HI> (neere the riuer <HI>Leire,</HI> if one may giue any credit to the comedy called <HI>Querulus,</HI> which goeth vnder the name of <HI>Plautus,</HI>) which is accounted to be the middle prouince of all <HI>France,</HI> do meet and keepe court as it were in a place con&s;ecrated to that purpo&s;e: hither do come all &s;uch as haue any controuer&s;ies from all quarters round about: euery man referring his cau&s;e to their hearing, and being content to &s;tand to their arbrurement and cen&s;ure. (In Chartraine to this day, a certeine memoriall &amp; note of the name <HI>Druides</HI> doth &s;eeme to remaine, in a place called <HI>Dreux.) Gabriel Simeon</HI> in his <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> newly reuiued, (<HI>Cae&s;ar renouatus,</HI> a worke of his &s;o intitled) writeth that he hath &s;eene, in a fore&s;t of this tract, a mention of an olde plot of the palace of the <HI>Druides.</HI> And thus much of the&s;e Druides, who&s;e arte magicke and cu&s;tome of killing of men, <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth did continue euen vnto his time, and withall addeth that it was abrogated, and they forbidden to v&s;e it any more, by proclamation from <HI>Tiberius Cae&s;ar. Suetonius</HI> in <HI>Claudius</HI> aff rmeth that it was fir&s;t inhabited by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> yet not generally, but to the citizens: and was at length vtterly taken away by the &s;ayd <HI>Claudius:</HI> wich al&s;o <HI>Seneca</HI> in his treati&s;e intituled <HI>Claudij ludus,</HI> doth auouch to be true. Yet notwith&s;tanding the name of the Druides was not then cleane extinct, as <HI>Tacitus,</HI> in the fourth booke of his H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;torie, plainly &s;heweth: where he writeth, that by the burning of the Capitoll, which hapned in the reigne of <HI>Ve&s;patian,</HI> the Druides in vaine made men beleeue was &s;ignified that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and command of the whole world &s;hould now come vnto the nations inhabiting beyond the Alps. <HI>Aelius Lampridius</HI> writeth, that <HI>Alexander Seuerus</HI> the Emperour going to warre again&s;t the <HI>Galli,</HI> a woman Druide cried out in the Gauls language with a loud voice, Thou goe&s;t into the field, but looke not to get the victory, tru&s;t not thy &s;ouldiers, they will faile thee. Neither was &s;he deceiued, for in tho&s;e warres he was &s;laine. <HI>Flauius Vopi&s;cus</HI> re|porteth, that <HI>Aurelianus</HI> asked coun&s;ell of the women Druides of <HI>France</HI> about his Empire, whether it &s;hould remaine vnto his po&s;terity, or not. The &s;ame authour te&s;tifieth, that when <HI>Diocletianus</HI> was yet but a priuate &s;ouldier, it was at <HI>Tongeren</HI> foretolde him by a Druide woman, that he &s;hould one day be Emperour of the whole world. Neither is there after him any mention of them in any hi&s;tory, to my remembrance, except one &s;hould &s;traine that of <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his fourth booke <HI>De Proepar.</HI> (for he liued in the time of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great and <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> his &s;onne) where he writeth that the Celtae euen to his time, did &s;acrifice men vpon their altars. <HI>Pliny</HI> noteth this of the Druides, that there is nothing which they do e&s;teeme more holy than mi&s;&s;elto, (which they call <HI>dryos hyphear</HI>) and &s;o likewi&s;e they account of the tree vpon which it groweth, e&s;pecially if it be an oke: They cho&s;e, &s;ayth he, groues of the&s;e trees apart by them&s;elues, neither do they any diuine &s;eruice or &s;acrifice without a branch of this tree: &s;o that they may very well be thought to be called <HI>Druidae,</HI> of the Greeke word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, <HI>an oke,</HI> as one would &s;ay, <HI>Oke-prie&s;ts.</HI> And indeed what&s;oeuer groweth vpon the&s;e trees, they do verily beleeue it to be &s;ent downe from heauen; and that it is a manife&s;t &s;igne that God hath cho&s;en this tree, and &s;anctified it to him&s;elfe. They call it in their language <HI>All-heale.</HI> The &s;acrifices and bankets being duely prepared and &s;et ready vnder this tree, they bring two white bulles, who&s;e hornes were neuer bound before. The Prie&s;t putting on a white garment, getteth vp into the tree ordeined for that &s;eruice, and with a golden hooke pruneth and loppeth off all the boughs. The&s;e are caught in a white ve&s;ture, like a &s;ouldiers ca&s;&s;ocke, before they come to the ground. Next after this they kill the buls prepared for the &s;acrifice, and withall make their prayers to God that he would ble&s;&s;e that his gift to the good of euery one that he there did vouch&s;afe to giue it. They are per&s;uaded that what bea&s;t &s;oeuer, though otherwi&s;e barren, &s;hall drinke of a potion made of it, &s;hall pre&s;ently become fruitfull: and that it is a mo&s;t &s;oueraigne anti|dote again&s;t all maner of poi&s;on what&s;oeuer. The &s;ame authour in the <HI>3.</HI> chap. of his <HI>29.</HI> booke, telleth a &s;trange tale of a &s;erpents egge, which he affirmeth he &s;aw ex|perimented and prooued before his face: I my &s;elfe, &s;ayth he, haue &s;eene one of the&s;e egges, which was about the bigne&s;&s;e of a prety round apple, couered with a gri&s;tly or cartilaginous &s;hell, indented with many concauities like vnto the hollow places wherein the legs of the fi&s;h called a polypus do re&s;t: This is the armes or cogni&s;ance of the Druides. It is wonderfully commended of them to be a great and &s;ecret experiment again&s;t all maner of contentions and brawles, procuring him that beareth it the vp|per hand, as al&s;o the fauour and ea&s;ie acce&s;&s;e to princes and great &s;tates, &amp;c. Item, he recordeth that the Druides did fir&s;t manife&s;t vnto the world that the herbe Sa|uin had an e&s;peciall vertue again&s;t all dangers &amp; pernicious accidents which ordinarily betide mortall men. Moreouer, they gather, with the left hand fa&s;ting, neuer loo|king behinde them, an herbe which they call <HI>Samolus,</HI> and affirme it, as he te&s;tifieth, to be a &s;oueraigne remedy again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es of hogs or &s;wine. The &s;ame authour &s;peaketh thus of another herbe called <HI>Selago:</HI> like vnto this herbe &s;auine is that which they call &s;elago: it mu&s;t not be cut vp with any knife or in&s;trument of iron, but mu&s;t be gathered with the right hand wrapped in the skirt of his coat, which mu&s;t be rent off with the left hand, as if he came to &s;teale it: he that doth this feat mu&s;t be clad in a white garment, barefooted, but &s;o as his feet be very cleane wa&s;hed and cleered from all filth: he mu&s;t fir&s;t offer &s;acrifice with bread and wine, before he ga|ther it: la&s;tly, it mu&s;t be caried home in a new napkin. This herbe thus gathered the Druidae of the Gauls do hold to be a great pre&s;eruatiue and defen&s;atory again&s;t all dangerous accidents and occurrences that v&s;ually happen to mortall men: moreouer they affirme that the fume thereof is good again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es of the eies. Such is the woonderfull &s;uper&s;tition of many nations in the world, and that for the mo&s;t part in friuolous and fooli&s;h things, as the &s;ame <HI>Pliny</HI> witne&s;&s;eth at the <HI>44.</HI> chapter of his <HI>26.</HI> booke. He that is de&s;irous to know more about the etymologie of the name of the <HI>Druides,</HI> let him repaire to <HI>Goropius</HI> his <HI>Gallica,</HI> where he fetcheth this name from a Dutch word, and proueth that it &s;ignifieth a teacher of truth, or a wi&s;eman continually bu&s;ied in the diligent &s;earch of the &s;ame. <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> al&s;o maketh them to be <HI>Magi&s;tros &s;apientiae,</HI> teachers and informers of others in Philo&s;ophy and all maner of humane wi&s;dome. I could be content to &s;ay that the word &s;hould &s;ignifie a Diuine or &s;tudent in the knowledge of God and heauenly things, (as <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> calleth them) for that I do &s;ee that <HI>Druthin,</HI> in the old Germaine tongue, doth &s;ignifie God: and that in <HI>Otfrides</HI> go&s;pels, a booke imprinted and to be had in diuers mens &s;tudies, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are louers of antiquities: and be&s;ides that I know that the I&s;landers, a people which &s;peake the Germaine tongue, although in a dialect farre different in many things from that which now is commonly &s;poken in High-Germany, (which al&s;o is incident to the Danes, and inhabitants of <HI>Norwey</HI> and <HI>Swedland,</HI> with other countries nere neighbours and bordeing vpon the Dutch) do yet to this day call God, by the name of <HI>Druthin. Diogenes Laertius</HI> al&s;o &s;eemeth to fauour this opinion, who, out of the authority of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> writeth that they were termed <HI>Semnothei,</HI> that is, religious and holy men, &s;uch as wholly gaue them&s;elues to the wor&s;hip and &s;eruice of God. In that laborious and learned worke of my &s;ingular good friend <HI>M. William Camden,</HI> which he wrote of the antiquities of <HI>England,</HI> and intituled by the name of <HI>Britannia,</HI> I reade that one <HI>Albricus</HI> hath written that the Saxons did call a <HI>magus. <HI>Drij,</HI></HI> (by a word that &s;ignifieth in that language as much as a Diuine or Philo&s;opher) and indeed <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth the&s;e Dru|ides, <HI>Magi,</HI> that is, wi&s;e men, as the word is often v&s;ed and expounded by the interpreters of the &s;econd chapter of S. Matthewes go&s;pell. For that they were not &s;o de|nominated of the oke, he him&s;elfe doth in a maner confe&s;&s;e; when he addeth in the &s;ame place, that they &s;eeme to be deriued from a Greeke word &s;ignifying an oke or mi&s;&s;elto. (Now there is no man that knoweth not, that to &s;eeme to be &s;o, and to be &s;o indeed, are two diuers things.) Againe, how can they haue their denomination of the Greeke word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, when as <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> a very &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;e, te&s;tifieth plainly, that their arte and di&s;cipline was fir&s;t inuented in <HI>England;</HI> where neuer any colony of the Greeks, for ought I know, was &s;eated: for that voyage of <HI>Vly&s;&s;es,</HI> (and &s;o of his comming into this iland) is counted for a fable, and no true &s;tory, of all men of &s;ound iudgement and di&s;cretion in this kinde of learning. Neither will I euer with <HI>Erato&s;thenes</HI> be made to beleeue the &s;ame, vntill &s;ome man or other &s;hall &s;hew me him that &s;ewed together his bagge full of windes. And that the Germane tongue was &s;poken here, there is no man can deny, but he that thinketh that the authority of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> is of no great validity. For <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> hath flatly in the &s;ame place left recorded, that out of <HI>Belgium</HI> (The Low-countries, where he al&s;o affirmeth that the <HI>Germani Ci&s;rhenani</HI> dwelt) certaine colonies pa&s;&s;ed ouer &s;ea into this ile, and &s;eated them&s;elues here. He auoucheth that <HI>Caledonia</HI> (a great part of this ile) was inhabited of a people which came thither from <HI>Germany.</HI> And becau&s;e there is nothing more &s;acred, in the iudgement of the&s;e Druidae, than the Oke and Mi&s;&s;elto, as we haue &s;hewed out of <HI>Pliny;</HI> and for that that <HI>Iupiter</HI> was here of them repre&s;ented in the forme of a mighty high oke, as <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> teacheth vs; I do &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Diodorus</HI> called them by another name, or els of the &s;ame &s;ignification, although improperly, <HI>Saronides,</HI> (except euen in this place al&s;o we are to read <HI>Druidae:</HI> which we haue at large handled in the &s;econd edition of our <HI>The&s;aurus</HI>) I know that <HI>Annius,</HI> out of his forged Bero&s;us, doth write that the&s;e <HI>Druides</HI> were called by tho&s;e diuers and &s;undry names, of <HI>Druius, Barrus, Sarron,</HI> certaine kings of the ancient Gauls. But as for the&s;e men, let them defend their credit them&s;elues: I know it is &s;hrewdly crackt. Some there are that do thinke that this by-word, <HI>Au Gui l' an neuf:</HI> With mi&s;&s;elto commeth in the new yeere: which to this day euery yeere, vpon the la&s;t of December, is commonly v&s;ed openly to be &s;ung in <HI>France,</HI> came from them. peraduenture of this of <HI>Ouid, Ad vi&s;cum Druidae, Druidae can|tare &s;olebant.</HI> which are at large handled by <HI>Goropius</HI> in his <HI>Gallica, Vinetus</HI> vpon <HI>A&s;onius,</HI> and <HI>Vigenereus</HI> vpon <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> Commentaries. <HI>Conradus Celtes, Irenicus, Althamer,</HI> and <HI>Auentine,</HI> do witne&s;&s;e with me that the&s;e Druides, being driuen hence by <HI>Tiberius</HI> and <HI>Claudius</HI> Emperours of <HI>Rome,</HI> went beyond the Rhein, and &s;eated them&s;elues in <HI>High Germany;</HI> and here hence amongst them euen to this day remaineth that &s;ame kinde of night-bug, commonly called the Phi|lo&s;ophicall &s;hoe, or as they terme it <HI>druttenfu&s;&s;.</HI> And it is in forme (as the learned <HI>Ioachimus Camerarius</HI> the yonger hath &s;ignified vnto me by his letters) fiue cor|nered, like vnto the emblem and hieroglyphicke of <HI>Hygeia,</HI> or, good health. This they engraue vpon their cradles, &s;uppo&s;ing that by that meanes the yoong infants are &s;afely garded from the fairies, hobgoblins, and night-walking &s;pirits. <HI>Conradus Celtes</HI> de&s;cribeth certaine ancient &s;tone images at the foot of the Pine-bearing moun|taine (<HI>Vichtelberg</HI> they commonly call it, in the mid&s;t and center of all <HI>Germany</HI>) which as he &s;ayth he &s;aw in a certaine Abbey there. The&s;e he thinketh to re&s;emble very liuelily the true counterfet of the&s;e Druides. They were in number &s;ix, &s;ayth he, &s;et in the wall at the church dore, &s;euen foot high a piece, barefooted, and bare|headed, ech of them had on a Spani&s;h cloake with a hood, and a &s;crip: a long beard downe as low as his girdle, and about his no&s;trils parted and &s;hod this way and that way: ech of them in his hand had a booke and a walking &s;taffe: they were of countenance &s;ad and grim: their heads leaned &s;omewhat toward one &s;houlder, hauing their eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly fixed vpon the ground. That de&s;cription of <HI>Iames Scepper,</HI> which he maketh of them, in his Corography of <HI>Germany,</HI> in my iudgement is fond and fooli&s;h: for he adorneth their necks, wre&s;ts, and fingers, with gold chaines, bracelets, and rings: moreouer to the&s;e he addceh a paire of buskins, &s;uch as the ancient Phi|lo&s;ophers were &s;ayd to weare, with party-coloured garments. From whence he had this de&s;cription I know not: for <HI>Pliny</HI> doth plainly affirme that they wore white garments; as we haue &s;hewed before: and <HI>Strabo</HI> in his &s;euenth booke, (where he calleth them by the name of <HI>Va es,</HI> Prophets) de&s;cribeth them in white ve&s;tures, with fine linnen frocks put ouer them, fa&s;tened together with a button, girt with a bra&s;en girdle, and bare footed.</P>

<P><HI>Of the originall and rea&s;on of the word</HI> Belgium <HI>and</HI> Belgica, <HI>the opinions of &s;undrie writers are diuers.

<P>Cae&s;ar, <HI>in his 1. booke of the warres of</HI> France, <HI>thus &s;peaketh:</HI> All <HI>GALLIA</HI> is diuided into <HI>3.</HI> parts: of the which the <HI>Belgae</HI> do inhabite one: the <HI>Aquita|ni</HI> another: the third, tho&s;e which in their language are called <HI>Celtae,</HI> but in the Latine <HI>Galli: Againe, within a few lines after:</HI> Of all the&s;e the <HI>Belgae</HI> are mo&s;t &s;tout and hardy: becau&s;e that being further off from the quaint behauiour and maners of the prouince: and for that they haue no trafficke with merchants, or &s;uch as do bring in tho&s;e things which effeminate mens mindes: againe becau&s;e they are next neighbours to the Germanes, which dwell beyond the <HI>Rhein:</HI> with whom they make warre continually. <HI>Item, in the &s;ame page he thus de&s;cribeth the &s;ituation of their country:</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> do dwell in the skirts of <HI>Gallia:</HI> they do belong to that part which is within the riuer <HI>Rhein:</HI> they are vpon the North and Ea&s;t &s;ides of it. <HI>The &s;ame authour in his 2. booke hath the&s;e words:</HI> Cae&s;ar found that many of the <HI>Belgae</HI> came from the Germanes, which long &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed ouer the <HI>Rhein</HI> and &s;eated them&s;elues there by rea&s;on of the great fertility of the place: and that they had driuen out the Gauls, which formerly had dwelled there: and that the&s;e were the onely men, which in the daies of our fathers, all <HI>Gallia</HI> being &s;ore troubled, kept the Teutones and Cimbres from entering within the li&s;ts of their territories: whereupon it came to pa&s;&s;e, that the memoriall and record of the&s;e their famous acts haue made them to take much vpon them, and to be highly conceited of their great &s;tomacks and skill in martiall affaires. <HI>Suet. in Tib. 9.</HI> In the German war he &s;ent ouer <HI>40000.</HI> voluntaries into <HI>Gallia. Again in the 8. booke of Cae&s;. Com.</HI> The <HI>Belgae,</HI> who&s;e valour was great. <HI>Strabo in the 4. booke of his Geography &s;aith:</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> weare ca&s;&s;ockes or cloakes, their haire long, and &s;ide breeches about their loines. In &s;teed of coates or ierkins they v&s;e a kind of &s;leeued garmert &s;lit, hanging down to their twi&s;t, or as low as their buttockes. Their wooll is very cour&s;e and rough, yet is it cut off clo&s;e to the skinne: of that they weaue their cour&s;e thick ca&s;&s;ocks, which they call <HI>laenas,</HI> rugges or mantles. Their weapons accordingly, are long &s;words hanging down along by their right &s;ide, a long target, lances an&s;werable, and a iauelin (<HI>meris</HI> or <HI>materis,</HI> as &s;ome read) a kind of &s;hort pike with a barbed head: &s;ome v&s;e bowes and &s;linges: others haue a &s;taffe like a dart, which they do not cast with a loop or thong, (as our Iri&s;h do) but with the hand only; yea and that further than one can well &s;hoot an arrow: this they e&s;pecially v&s;e in hunting and fowling. They do all for the mo&s;t part, euen to this day, v&s;e to lie vpon the ground; they dine and &s;uppe &s;itting in their beds. Their meat generally is made of milke and all kind of fle&s;h, e&s;pecially porke, both fre&s;h and powdered. Their hogs do lie abroad in the fields night and day: the&s;e for bigne&s;&s;e, &s;trength and &s;wiftne&s;&s;e of foot do &s;urpa&s;&s;e tho&s;e of other countries; and if a man be not v&s;ed to them they are as dangerous to meet withall as with a rauening woolfe. They build their hou&s;es with boords, planks and hardles, couered ouer with a very great roofe. They haue &s;o many and great herds of cattle and hogs, that they do not only &s;erue <HI>Rome</HI> with tho&s;e fornamed ca&s;&s;ocks or rugs, powdered beefe and bacon, but al&s;o many other places of <HI>Italy.</HI> The mo&s;t of their cities and commonwealths are gouerned by the Nobility and gentry: informer times the common people v&s;ed yearely to choo&s;e one Prince, and one Generall captaine for the wars. They are for the mo&s;t part &s;ubiect to the behe&s;ts of the Romans. They haue a kind of cu&s;tome in their councels proper and peculiar to them&s;elues: for if any man do interrupt or trouble another by loud &s;peaking, or by making any tumult, the &s;ergeant commeth to him with a naked knife in his hand and threatneth him if he hold not his peace: this he doth the &s;econd and third time: if then he will not be quiet, he cutteth off &s;o much of his ca&s;&s;ocke, that the re&s;t may be good for nothing. This is a common thing to them with many other barbarous nations, that the &s;eruices or of|fices of men and women are ordered clean contrary to the cu&s;tomes &amp; maners which heere we v&s;e. <HI>Item, in another place.</HI> The Gauls the neerer they are to the North and to the Sea. &s;o much the more hardy and valiant they are. They do e&s;pecially commend the <HI>Belgae,</HI> who are diuided into <HI>15.</HI> nations (in <HI>Cae&s;ar!</HI> find <HI>31.</HI> mentioned) &s;o that the <HI>Belgae</HI> alone &s;u&s;teined the a&s;&s;ault of the Germans, Cimbers and Teutones. What an infinite number of men they were able to make, may h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ere hence be ga|thered, that long &s;ince there were mu&s;tered of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> only of able men fit for the war, <HI>300000.</HI> (this number <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in the beginning of the <HI>2.</HI> booke of the wars of <HI>France,</HI> encrea&s;eth by <HI>27000.</HI> more) <HI>Item,</HI> &s;ome there are which diuide the Gauls into <HI>3</HI> nations: namely, the <HI>Aquitani, Belgae</HI> and <HI>Celtae. Item,</HI> The <HI>Belgae</HI> do po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e the places neere the Sea, euen as low as the mouth of the <HI>Rhein: Dio. Sic. in his 6. booke.</HI> A nation for the mo&s;t part &s;ituat in tho&s;e places toward the North: it is a cold country, &s;o that in winter time in &s;teed of water, it is all couered ouer with deep &s;now. The ice al&s;o in this country, is &s;o great and thicke, that their riuers are frozen &s;o hard that they may go ouer them; and that not only &s;ome few in a company together, but euen whole armies with hor&s;es, carts and cariage. <HI>Plutarch in the life of Cae&s;ar.</HI> But after that news came that the <HI>Belgae,</HI> the mo&s;t mighty and warlike nation of the Gauls, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the third part of all <HI>Gallia,</HI> had gathered together many thou&s;ands of armed men, purpo&s;ing to make head, he goeth again&s;t them with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, <HI>&amp;c.

<HEAD>GERMANIE.</HEAD>
<P>_I Thinke there is no man, &s;tudious of ancient hi&s;torie, that is ignorant, that this countrey was called of the mo&s;t ancient writers, e&s;peci|ally the Graecians, <HI>CELTICA,</HI> and the people therof <HI>CELTI</HI> or <HI>CELTICA.</HI> From whence the word <HI>Kelt</HI> doth remaine amongst them; whereby they yet do v&s;ually call one another in their familiar &s;peech and communication. Some there are which thinke them to be called by <HI>Io&s;ephus ASCHANARI,</HI> whenas notwith&s;tanding he &s;ayth that the&s;e are interpreted of the Graecians to be the <HI>Rhegini:</HI> better perhaps and more truly, <HI>Rheini,</HI> as it were the borderers vpon the <HI>Rhene,</HI> who al&s;o of Stephanus are called <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. Tacitus reporteth that the word <HI>GERMANIA</HI> had not beene long v&s;ed, and to be but lately heard of. The &s;ame authour ad|deth, that this name was inuented by them&s;elues. Wherefore I do more ea&s;ily a&s;&s;ent to them, which deriue the originall of this word from the etymon of the countrey it &s;elfe, than from the Latines. For it is much more likely that a nation &s;hould impo&s;e a name vpon it &s;elfe deriued from that language which it vnder&s;tood, than from a forren and &s;trange tongue whereof it was altogether ignorant. I thinke therefore they erre which thinke this name to be made <HI>&agrave; germine,</HI> that is, of buds or yong &s;prouts; by rea&s;on of the great fer|tilitie and plenty of all things here growing. Of this opinion are Fe&s;tus and I&s;idorus. Tho&s;e al&s;o which deriue the name from the Latine word <HI>germanus</HI> &s;ignifying a <HI>brother,</HI> as Strabo doth, as who would &s;ay, brethren to the Gauls or French men, from whom, as he &s;ayth, they little differ, in my conceit are as farre wide from the trueth. Our countrey man, as Rhenanus and others doe thinke it to be compounded of <HI>gar</HI> and <HI>man,</HI> to wit, <HI>garman,</HI> that is, <HI>all man</HI> or <HI>manlike.</HI> Our Goropius of <HI>ger</HI> and <HI>man</HI> (comming neerer to the writing or letter) of <HI>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en,</HI> which &s;ignifieth <HI>to gather,</HI> as &s;craping together a booty or pray. And the &s;ame man in another place deriueth it of <HI>ger,</HI> which, &s;aith he, amongst our ance&s;ters &s;ignifieth <HI>warre:</HI> which I &s;ee al&s;o plea&s;eth Iu&s;tus Lip&s;ius be&s;t. I know that <HI>gerre</HI> (or rather <HI>guerre</HI>) in the latter French tongue &s;ignifieth <HI>warre;</HI> but whether it &s;ignifieth &s;o in our ancient Germane tongue, I know not. I doe ea&s;ily be|leeue that this nation fir&s;t wrote and named it &s;elfe <HI>werman,</HI> of <HI>wer,</HI> with <HI>e</HI> long, a mere Germane word, which &s;ignifieth any weapon whereby we &s;mite or offend our enemie. From hence <HI>weren</HI> &s;ignifieth to defend him&s;elfe again&s;t the enemie: and we call euery man fit to beare armes, <HI>weerman</HI> or <HI>weerbaerman,</HI> (that is, a war|likeman.) In&s;omuch that they all called them&s;elues <HI>wermanos,</HI> or, <HI>wermannos,</HI> that is, warlike men. And Ce&s;ar and Tacitus, be&s;ides others, are mo&s;t &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es, that this name doth altogether agree with the nature and di&s;po&s;ition of this nation. As al&s;o Diony&s;ius Afer, who &s;urnameth the&s;e Martiali&s;ts or warlike men <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. But the cau&s;e is plaine why the&s;e do call and write them&s;elues <HI>Germanes;</HI> becau&s;e they, wanting the digamma or <HI>W,</HI> in &s;tead of it haue &s;ub&s;tituted the <HI>G.</HI> which al&s;o we &s;ee el&s;where done of them in the like ca&s;e: as, for Wilhelmus, they write Gulielmus; for Waltherus, Galtherus; for Walfridus, Galfridus, &amp;c. So al&s;o it is likely that for <HI>Walli,</HI> they wrote and pronounced <HI>Galli.</HI> For euen we Germanes, on this &s;ide Rhene, retaining the ancient language, doe yet name the&s;e <HI>Galli</HI> by no other name than <HI>Walen.</HI> The <HI>Galli</HI> al&s;o them&s;elues romanizing (the libertie and ancient tongue being lo&s;t) doe vnto this very day imitate this change of letters. The&s;e few words out of many are for an example: for they v&s;ually both write and pronounce, <HI>vin</HI> for <HI>wijn, <HI>Gue&s;p</HI></HI> for <HI>We&s;p, <HI>Gand</HI></HI> for <HI>Wandt, <HI>Guedde</HI></HI> for <HI>Weedt,</HI> by which they meane Wine, a Wa&s;p, a Gloue, and Woad. So al&s;o I finde in a manu&s;cript <HI>Guandali</HI> for <HI>Wandali.</HI> If any man &s;hall obiect that Strabo, Di|ony&s;ius Afer, Ptolemaeus, and &s;ome other Graecians, who knew the digamma Aeolicum, that is, the <HI>W,</HI> haue notwith&s;tanding written it with a &s;ingle <HI>V,</HI> I an&s;wer, that this nation was knowen to the&s;e men in times pa&s;t only vnder the name of Celtae, and that this word <HI>Germane</HI> was fir&s;t v&s;ed of Ce&s;ar or the other Latines in their writings: from whom the Grecians, imitating this writing, haue tran&s;lated this word into their language. But if any man de&s;ireth to reade more of the etymology and rea&s;on of the word <HI>Germanie,</HI> let him peru&s;e H. Iunius his Batauia in the one and twentieth chapter. There are &s;ome hi&s;torians that doe verily beleeue that all the <HI>Germanes</HI> were in latter times called <HI>Alemanes,</HI> Vopi&s;cus &s;o per&s;uading them in the life of Proculus. Yet it is manife&s;t out of Aelius Spartianus (who repor|teth that Antoninus Caracalla the Romane Emperour, both nations by him being &s;ubdued, tooke him the &s;urname of them both, and was intituled both by the name of <HI>GERMANICVS</HI> and <HI>ALEMANNICVS</HI>) that the&s;e were two diuers nations. Moreouer, this &s;ame thing is to be &s;eene in the marble in&s;criptions of the Empe|rours, Valens, Valentinian, and Gratian: as al&s;o in the titles of Iu&s;tinian the Emperour. Againe, Ammianus in his <HI>26</HI> booke writeth, that the Almanes brake thorow the borders of Germanie, whereby it is as clere as the noone day that they were diuers. But that was the name of one family or people, this of the whole &s;tocke or nation. Notwith&s;tanding, although this Alemannie of Stephanus, Ammianus, and other writers of that age was accounted only a part of Germanie, namely of that which lieth about the riuer Aleman (commonly called <HI>Altmul</HI>) yet all men of other countries, ignorant of the Germane tongue, do v&s;e the word Alemanie for all Germanie, and by Alemanes, do meane all the Germanes. But the inhabitants at this day name them&s;elues <HI>Teut&s;chen, <HI>Tui&s;iones:</HI></HI> whether of god <HI>Tui&s;ius,</HI> &s;onne of the earth, of whom Tacitus maketh mention, or of <HI>Tui&s;co,</HI> No&euml; his &s;onne, of whom P&s;eudobero&s;us &s;peaketh; I leaue to the iudgement of the learned reader, for to me it is vncer|taine. And thus much of the name. Ouid writing to Liuia, doth grace it with a very heroicall &s;urname and honourable titles, when he calleth it <HI>ORBEM GER|MANVM, ORBEM NOVVM, &amp; ORBEM IGNOTVM: The Germane world, The new world,</HI> and <HI>The vnknowen world.</HI> Ptolemey &s;urnameth it <HI>THE GREAT.</HI> Pliny in the third booke of his Epi&s;tles vnto his friend Macer, calleth it <HI>LATISSIMAM, A mo&s;t wide and &s;pacious countrey.</HI> Learne the forme of it out of Diony&s;ius and Pri&s;cian his interpreter, or as &s;ome call him, Rhemnius, in his periege&s;is in this ver&s;e: <HI>Haec tergo &s;imilis taurino dicirur e&s;&s;e:</HI> In forme, they &s;ay, it's &s;omewhat like vnto a large buffe hide. (but fal&s;ly: for this is truly &s;poken of Spaine, as Arid. Papius, before me, hath well ob&s;erued.) The &s;i|tuation and limits of this countrey are diuers and &s;undry wayes de&s;cribed, according to the diuer&s;itie and alteration of times. Plutarch in Marius, doth extend it from the Exterior or Outmo&s;t &s;ea, and the Northern parts, to the ri&s;ing of the Sunne neere the fenne Moeotis <HI>[Mar delle Zabbache]</HI> where it toucheth the Ponticke Scy|thia. Pomponius Mela al&s;o, and P&s;eudobero&s;us, do confine it with Sarmatia Europoea. And Martian &s;tretcheth it fron Hi&s;ter <HI>[Donawe]</HI> to the Ocean, euen vp as high as the de&s;erts of Sarmatia: (But the word <HI>Armeniae</HI> is fal&s;ly read for <HI>Sarmatiae,</HI> that I may with Pintian, by the way correct this fault in this authour.) Dio|ny&s;ius Apher al&s;o placeth the Germanes at the fenne Moeotis. Yea and P. Diacono in his fir&s;t chapter, vnder the name of Germanie, comprehendeth al&s;o all Scandie or Scone in Denmarke, where he de&s;cribeth that denne or caue neere the Scric&s;inners, in which &s;euen men &s;lept. And this I thinke to be that Exteriour Germanie which Eu&s;ebius in his &s;ixt booke <HI>De Praepar. Euang.</HI> de&s;cribeth toward the North. I&s;idore therefore rightly placeth the Riphaean mountaines at the head of Germa|nie. Others haue made the &s;ea, the Alpes, Vi&s;tula (the riuer <HI>Wixell</HI>) and the Rheine, to be the limits of the &s;ame. But Tacitus taketh from it what&s;oeuer is be|tweene Donawe and the Alpes. For he confineth it within the&s;e limits: namely, the Rhene, Donawe, the Dacia's (<HI>Tran&s;&s;yluania</HI> and <HI>Walachia</HI>) and the Sarma|tia's, <HI>(Ru&s;&s;ia)</HI> with whom al&s;o Ptolemey the prince of Geographers con&s;enteth. But Strabo and Pomponius do notwith&s;tanding extend it euen to the very Alpes, and &s;o by the&s;e mountaines do diuide it from Italy, as it were by a certeine naturall rampart or bulwarke. And this is yet at this day the true and naturall Germanie: which on the North &s;ide is circum&s;cribed with the &s;ea, on the South with the Alpes, on the We&s;t with the Rhene, and on the Ea&s;t with Vi&s;tula <HI>(Wixell)</HI> or Odera. Moreouer, Suetonius, Tacitus, and Dion do diuide this true Germanie into the <HI>VPPER</HI> and <HI>LOWER:</HI> they call that the <HI>VPPER GERMANIE</HI> which is neerer the fountaines or head of the Rhene; that the <HI>LOWER</HI> which reacheth from thence to the Ocean. But beyond the Rhene al&s;o, namely in <HI>Belgia,</HI> Ptolemey hath other two Germanies, to wit, a <HI>SVPERIOR</HI> and <HI>INFERIOR.</HI> To whom agreeth Marcellinus, who nameth this the <HI>SECOND,</HI> that the <HI>FIRST.</HI> But I do not iudge the&s;e to pertaine to the true Germanie: but that it was &s;o improperly called of the Germanes, who, as Dion witne&s;&s;eth, afterward po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and fixed their &s;eats there. And fir&s;t of the <HI>Tungri,</HI> who as Tacitus writeth, fir&s;t of all other pa&s;&s;ed ouer the Rhene. Item we read in Ce&s;ar of certaine <HI>Belgae,</HI> &s;prung from the Germanes. Hence it is that he witne&s;&s;eth that the <HI>Neruij, Aduatici, Atrebates, Ambiani, Morini, Menapij, Caletes, Veroca&s;&s;es, Veromandui, Catuaci, Condru&s;i, Eburones, Caere&s;i, Paemani, Segni,</HI> were generally <HI>GERMANI TRANSRHENANI, the Germans beyond Rhene.</HI> Tacitus &s;aith that the <HI>Van|giones, Triboci,</HI> and <HI>Nemetes</HI> were called Germanes. Suetonius recordeth that <HI>Tiberius</HI> the Emperour placed fortie thou&s;and Germanes in France neere the banke of the Rhene. Eutropius writeth that there were of them foure hundred thou&s;and. Item by the te&s;timony of Pliny we are made to beleeue that the Germane na|tion did dwell euen as high as the riuer Scaldis <HI>(the Sceldt.)</HI> And that at this day the Germans are &s;eated beyond Scaldis, vp as high as the &s;traits of the Ocean, the language which they v&s;e, doth manife&s;tly proue. So that Dion in his <HI>53</HI> booke hath truely related, that they haue &s;pread them&s;elues as farre as the Briti&s;h ocean, vp to the citie Bononia or <HI>Boloigne:</HI> which Zo&s;imus calleth a citie of Lower Germanie.</P>
<P>But let vs omit the&s;e things, and returne to the de&s;cription of the true and ancient Germanie, which we haue &s;et forth in this table. Seneca reporteth, that there is a continuall Winter, vnplea&s;ant aire, and barren &s;oile. Pomponius writeth that it is troubled with many riuers, rough and vneuen by rea&s;on of many mountaines, and for the mo&s;t part not to be trauelled or pa&s;&s;ed thorow, by rea&s;on of the great woods and fennes. Frontinus affirmeth the &s;ame, where he writeth, that the Germans were woont to a&s;&s;ault the Romans out of the&s;e places, as out of ob&s;cure couerts, and thither &s;afely to retire them&s;elues againe. Tacitus &s;ayth that it is euery where be &s;pread and couered with hideous woods, and loath&s;ome and &s;tincking fennes, the land or countrey is vnplea&s;ant, the aire is &s;harpe, it is hard to be plowed, and ill fauoured to behold. It is moister towards the Galliae <HI>(France;)</HI> windier towards Noricum <HI>(Bayern)</HI> and the Pannoniae. <HI>(Au&s;tria and Hungary.)</HI> The cau&s;e I adde, becau&s;e here the Alpes are oppo&s;ite, which entertaining the boi&s;terous Northern winde, do by their extraordinary height beat it backe againe, and &s;o redoubleth the violence of the bla&s;t. (The copy here is &s;ound &amp; good, although a great &s;cholar doth thinke it faulty.) There, becau&s;e the ocean is neerer, Ouid and Horatius call it hideous cruell and &s;auage. Manilius &s;ayth, that it is &s;it only for wilde bea&s;ts: which indeed is wholly occupied by the Hercynian forre&s;t, being not inferior to any for greatne&s;&s;e and fame (as Pliny reporteth.) For this Hercynianwood, (which Erato&s;thenes, Apollonius and Ptolemaeus, being Grecians, name <HI>orcynium</HI>) of all others by farre the greate&s;t, is three&s;core dayes iourney in length, as Mela &s;ayth. Which, &s;eeing that no man hath more diligently de&s;cribed this wood than Ce&s;ar, we will here &s;et downe his words, which are the&s;e: The bredth of this Hercynian wood is nine long dayes iourney ouer. It beginneth from the borders of the Heluetians and Nemeti, and Rauraci, and &s;o running along directly by the riuer Donawe, it commeth vp clo&s;e by the confines of the Dacia's. From hence it windeth Northward, or toward the left hand, leauing the cour&s;e of the riuer, and by rea&s;on of the huge greatne&s;&s;e of the &s;ame, toucheth the bounds of many nations. Neither is there any man of all this Ger|manie, which can &s;ay that he hath either heard of, or gone to the end of that wood, when he had beene in it three&s;core dayes together: there is not any man that euer

<PB REF="278"> hath heard in what place it beginneth, &amp;c. Plinie hath the&s;e words of the &s;ame wood: The hugene&s;&s;e of the okes of the Hercynian wood, neuer lopt or cut &s;ince the world was made, doth almo&s;t for their immortality exceed all other miracles. That I may omit other things which would not be beleeued; it is ma|nife&s;t, that the little hilles are eleuated by the mutuallil encounter or cro&s;&s;ing of the roots one within another: but where the earth is hollow and not fa&s;t, there they ri&s;e with arches euen vp to the boughs, and &s;triuing as it were among them&s;elues, are crooked like broad gates, that whole troups of hor&s;emen may go vn|derneath them. Suidas out of Iulian de&s;cribeth the roughne&s;&s;e hereof: If any man, &s;ayth he, &s;hall con&s;ider the vnpa&s;&s;able Tempe of The&s;&s;alie, or the narrow &s;traights of Thermopylae, or the great and &s;teepe hie mountaine Taurus, it is nothing to this; they are not &s;o difficult and hard to doe, as to pa&s;&s;e thorow this Hercynian wood. And thus much of this groue or fore&s;t, inacce&s;&s;ible, as Florus writeth of it. Nay, but Plinie addeth that the other part of Germanie is al|&s;o full of woods. Item Tacitus in the fourth of his Annals, &s;ayth that abroad they haue forests of huge bea&s;ts, &amp; at home herds or droues of &s;maller cattell. We reade in the &s;ame authour, that the ground of Germanie is &s;andie couered ouer with a very thin laine of turfes, yet their pa&s;tures are very commendable. Tacitus maketh it to be rea&s;onably well &s;tored with cattell, but impatient of fruitfull trees. Herodian reporteth, that the Germans haue few buildings of &s;tone or bricke; and that they rather delight to abide in arbours and bowers made in thicke woods, by coupling and fa&s;tening the boughs together. They haue no habitations or hou&s;es but &s;uch as wearine&s;&s;e maketh for a day. Seneca in the booke of Gods prouidence reporteth that they defend them&s;elues from &s;torme and tempe&s;t by the couerture of reeds or leaues. Tacitus &s;ayth that they make caues vnder the earth, and couer them ouer with dung, and v&s;e them for pla|ces of refuge, to which they may in danger retire them&s;elues. From who&s;e opinion a place in <HI>Strabo</HI> doth not farre &s;eeme to differ: where he &s;ayth they dwell in cottages made for one day, that &s;o they may with more ea&s;e change their &s;oile, and putting their hou&s;ehold-&s;tuffe into carts, may depart whither they be&s;t like. For Eu&s;ebius m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">keth them ignorant both of Geometrie and of Architectrie. So that the &s;ame Tacitus doth mo&s;t truly deny that the Germanes do v&s;ually inhabit or d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ell in cities; or can abide by any meanes to ioyne hou&s;e to hou&s;e clo&s;e together, but to haue them di&s;ioyned or &s;euered, as &s;hall fall out by rea&s;on of &s;ome brooke, field, or wood. I al&s;o will adde this, that they haue anciently had few cities: for in all ancient hi&s;tories of ech tongue, I &s;ee &s;car&s;e one or two na|med before Ptolemies time. Neither &s;ince him is there any mention of them in any other writer. Capitolinus writeth of Maximinus the Emperour, that he burned three or foure hundred villages: but there is no mention of cities. Strabo (as diligent a writer as any in that kinde) remembreth only <HI>Bouia&s;mus,</HI> the palace or court of Maroboduus. Tacitus, to whom Germanie was be&s;t knowen, maketh mention of <HI>Matium, Arenacum, Batauodurum,</HI> and one or two ca&s;tles neere the mouth of the Rheine, which any man would &s;ooner iudge to be a&s;cribed to France than to Germanie. In other writers, there is not one word of any cities. And thus much in generall of the &s;ituation of the &s;oile, the forme and nature of this countrey. Now &s;ome things peculiar to it, are to be con&s;ide|red: and fir&s;t I will &s;peake of the riuer Rheine, that which I haue read in a certaine epi&s;tle of Iulian the Emperour to Maximus the Philo&s;opher; his words are the&s;e: Rheine doth violently carry away ba&s;tard-infants as a reuenger of the vncha&s;te bed: but tho&s;e that are borne in wedlocke of cha&s;te parents, it bea|reth aloft vpon the top of the water, and re&s;toreth them againe to the trembling hands of the mother: and by the pre&s;eruation of the infant doth pay as it were the true and incorrupted te&s;timony of cha&s;te and laudable wedlocke. Nazianzene, Nonnus in his Diony&s;iacks, and an ancient Greeke Epigram doe al&s;o auer this to be true. There are other al&s;o which do giue another, and in mine opinon, a truer cau&s;e of this dipping of children in the Rheine, which we will by and by relate. There is a fountaine among the Mattiaci, which, being drawen, doth boile three dayes together: and about the brinke the waters make pumei&s;e &s;tones, as Pliny witne&s;&s;eth. The &s;ame authour de&s;cribeth in Fri&s;land, a fountaine of &s;weet water, whereof if one &s;hall drinke, within two yeeres after his teeth will all fall out of his head: and that the herbe called Britannica, there found, is a pre&s;ent remedie again&s;t that danger. As in Nilus &s;o in Donawe or I&s;ter (as Suidas reporteth) there are great falles of water, like a mountaine, growing vnder the water, according to the whole breadth of the riuer, again&s;t which the &s;treame falling doth with great &amp; terrible noi&s;e &s;well backe againe; and fir&s;t making a rumbling amongst the rocks, at length mounting ouer them cau&s;eth, the &s;tearme by the violent fall being forced to turne round, whirlpooles, troublous motions, and dangerous gulfs. Strabo al&s;o maketh mention of the &s;ame. Germanie hath the be&s;t <HI>Amber</HI> (which as Tacitus writeth, they call <HI>Glo&s;&s;e</HI>) which they gather betweene the &s;hallow foords and the &s;ea &s;hores); Bra&s;&s;e ore, or the bra&s;&s;ie &s;tone, which they call <HI>Cadmia,</HI> cry&s;tall, the callais, a precious &s;tone, which they prefer before that of Arabia, the onyx, and a white kinde of tho&s;e &s;tones com|monly called <HI>Ceraunia,</HI> which if you holde in the open aire doth dimini&s;h the glittering of the &s;tarres; witne&s;&s;e Plinie and Soline. Here al&s;o is found the A|damant, if Scep&s;ius, in this &s;ame authour, doth &s;peake the trueth; and the Topaze (except there be &s;ome fault in the copy, in the fourth and eight chapters of the &s;euen and thirtieth booke: for &s;ome books read in this place, Carmania for Germania.) Tacitus dares not denie but that Germanie hath veines both of &s;iluer and golde: and he reporteth that Curtius Rufus dambd vp a caue in the field of Matium, to &s;earch for veines of &s;iluer. Plinie reporteth that mines of bra&s;&s;e were found but the other day in Germanie. I finde in the &s;ame Tacitus that the Gothini did dayly worke in yron mines. Lycophron de&s;cribeth the hog fi&s;h with foure feet in Donawe. And about the head or fountaines hereof Pliny &s;peaketh of a kinde of blacke fi&s;hes, which being eaten are pre&s;ent death. The &s;ame authour mentioneth the <HI>E&s;ox,</HI> a fi&s;h proper to the riuer Rheine: (&s;ome read <HI>Exo&s;&s;em;</HI> againe, for Rheine they reade Donawe: for I know the fi&s;h <HI>Exo&s;&s;is,</HI> that is, a fi&s;h that hath no maner of bones, no not the backe bone, which liueth in Donawe, as Iornandes te&s;tifieth with me, not in the Rheine: of who&s;e clammy fle&s;h, not vnlike to the &s;auour of yoong porke, we &s;ometimes ta&s;ted at Vienna in Au&s;tria, but much again&s;t our &s;tomacke. They call it <HI>Hau&s;en,</HI> namely of the greatne&s;&s;e, &s;hewing it &s;elfe in the water like little hou&s;es. Ca&s;&s;iodor in his twelfth booke attributeth the Carpe to Donawe. The riuer Maemus (Aelianus calleth it Danubius) affoordeth the fi&s;h called Silurus: the be&s;t goo&s;e feathers, especially tho&s;e next the body: the radi&s;h roots, as great as little children: the herbe <HI>Corruda</HI> a kinde of &s;perage, as Pliny te&s;tifieth; who confe&s;&s;eth al&s;o that he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">here an hony combe eight foot long. The &s;ame authour with Solinus and Ce&s;ar doth a&s;cribe the&s;e bea&s;ts as proper to this place, the alcen, the buffe, the vrus, and the machlis. Ca&s;&s;iodor in the third booke of his <HI>Variar.</HI> chap. <HI>50,</HI> &s;ayth that the Alemanes oxen are more precious than tho&s;e of other places, by rea&s;on of their great bodies. Ce&s;ar al&s;o in the &s;ixt booke of the French warres mentioneth a kinde of oxe, of which he thus &s;ayth: There is an oxe in &s;hape and proportion like to an hart; from the mid&s;t of who&s;e fore|head there groweth betweene the eares, one horne higher than the re&s;t, and &s;traiter than any of tho&s;e hornes which we know: from the top thereof they &s;pread abroad like the boughs of the palme-tree. There are birds in Hercynia who&s;e feathers doe &s;hine in the night like fire, as Pliny reporteth, or who&s;e quilles, as Solinus &s;ayth, doe gli&s;ter and &s;hine in the darke, yea although the night be neuer &s;o darke and ouerca&s;t: in&s;omuch that the men of that place do often times &s;o appoint their nightly out goings, that they may v&s;e them as lights for the directing and finding of their way: and hauing ca&s;t them before in the darke wayes, do &s;ee which way to go, by the marke of the glittering feathers. Of the&s;e very &s;ame &s;peaketh Pri&s;cian, or who&s;oeuer els was the interpreter of Diony&s;ius his Pe|riege&s;is, <HI>Et pa&s;cit volucres mirum fulgentibus alis, Quies ducibus noctu cernuntur flexa viarum.</HI> Here liueth the golden feathered fowle, A woonder tis to tell, Who&s;e quilles being &s;trew'd in darke&s;t wayes, Do guide men pa&s;&s;ing well. Pliny hath left written, that there is &s;eene in Germany, especially in Win|ter the <HI>turdus</HI> or felfare. Plutarch in his le&s;&s;er parallels writeth that there are two altars in Germanie, which yerely vpon a certaine day do &s;ound like trumpets in memorie of the daughter of C. Marius &s;acrificed long &s;ince in that place. Now let vs &s;peake &s;omething of the Nation. Columella &s;ayth it is a land of mo&s;t tall men: Pliny and Solinus who imitated or followed him, &s;ay that it is a rich countrey for men, full of very many big and boi&s;terous people. Sidonius calleth the Alemans cruell and fierce: Ca&s;&s;iodor, a proud and innumerable nation. Pau&s;anias in his Arcadia reporteth the &s;ame. Ce&s;ar, Arrianus, Appianus, He|rodotus, Polyaenus, Vegetius, and Columella do all ioyntly affirme, that they are all tall of &s;tature and very big limm'd men. Diony&s;ius calleth them, White Germanes: Calpurnius Flaccus, Ruddy: Tacitus, Blew eyed: Iuuenal, Yellow hair'd: others, Red hair'd. Martiall and Seneca de&s;cribe them with their haire wreathed and bound vp in a knot. Tertullian in his booke <HI>De Virginibus velandis,</HI> doth highly commend their goodly locks. Appian &s;ayth that they are very crabbed in maners, and cruelly minded. Ce&s;ar calleth them barbarous and cruell: Io&s;ephus in the &s;econd booke of the Iewi&s;h warre, chap. <HI>16,</HI> &s;tout and hardy: Diony&s;ius Afer, very warlike and martiall: Hege&s;ippus, boi&s;terous and inuincible: Arrian and Diony&s;ius, &s;ouldierlike: his olde interpreter, &s;terne and &s;urly: Arrianus, proud and arrogant. There is no man more couragious than a Germane, none more eager or hot to giue an on&s;et or a&s;&s;ault, none more de&s;irous of warres; as Seneca, in his booke of Anger, writeth. Herodian calleth it a nation very couetous of money: Ouid, faithle&s;&s;e and trecherous: Ce&s;ar, fal&s;e traitours and deepe di&s;&s;emblers: Paterculus, mo&s;t crafty in their greate&s;t cruelty and borne to lie. (But who can expect better commendations and report of an enemie prouoked to the full, beat backe and forced to flie with great lo&s;&s;e and &s;laughter more than once or twice?) Tacitus, who liued among them, in the third booke of his hi&s;tories, &s;peaketh more vprightly, when he &s;ayth, That the &s;ouldiers are mo&s;t fierce and desperate: and that the nation deligh|teth much in warre, is nothing wily or crafty, but &s;uch as ea&s;ily layeth open the &s;ecrets of their hearts, di&s;clo&s;ing their mindes one to another, and &s;uch as no man may better tru&s;t vpon their credit. The &s;ame authour &s;ayth, that Iulian the Emperour in his Mi&s;opogonos, who writeth that he hath learned by expe|rience, that it is a nation which can not flatter, but &s;uch as loueth to liue freely and plainly with all men. Ptolemaeus in the &s;econd booke of his Quadripartite teacheth that they are by nature and con&s;titution of body temperate, and milde in condition, by rea&s;on of the qualitie of the region wherein they dwell. Thus much of their nature and qualities: now a word or two of their rites and maners. A&s;&s;oone as their children are borne, they cary them to the riuer, (layed vp|on a &s;hield, &s;ayth the Greeke epigram) as they come warme from their mothers wombe, as Galen and Ari&s;totle in the eight booke of his Politicks, doe t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="4 letters">e: and there dipping them as the Smith doth his hot yrons into the colde water, do make triall both of the hardne&s;&s;e of their nature, and by this meanes withall they do much &s;trengthen the body. This is that which Claudian &s;ayth, <HI>Na&s;centes explorat gurgite Rhenus.</HI> The riuer Rhene trieth tho&s;e that are new borne. And this I thinke to be the more likely cau&s;e: fora&s;much as the Poet attributeth the &s;ame to his Italians: for he &s;ayth, <HI>Natos ad flumina prim&ugrave;m Deferimus, &s;aeuo&abque; gelu duramus &amp; vndis.</HI> The babes new borne to riuers cold, In fro&s;t and &s;now we bring, To harden them again&s;t all &s;tormes, Into the mid&s;t we &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng. Which is the &s;ame that Sidonius writeth of the Thracians in the&s;e words: <HI>Excipit hic natos glacies, &amp; matris ab aluo, Artus infantum
<PB REF="278"> molles nix Cambrica durat.</HI> Al&s;o Val. Flac. <HI>6.</HI> of the Scythians, <HI>vbi tam &s;aeno durauimus amne, Progeniem, nato&s;&abque; rudes, &amp;c.</HI> Suidas, in the word Lycurgus, teacheth, that this was proper to the Lacedaemonians: as al&s;o Seneca <HI>in Sua&s;orijs,</HI> who moreouer &s;ayth that the riuer Eurota doth harden tender youth, to make them able to abide the better the mi&s;eries of warfare. (This cu&s;tome doth yet continue amongst the Iaponians, as Mapheius witne&s;&s;eth.) Cae&s;ar &s;ayth they giue them&s;elues to hardne&s;&s;e from their childhood. If he were borne in Germany (&s;ayth Seneca) he would forthwith being but a child, know how to handle a little iauelin. Yong men, who make it but a pa&s;time, do ca&s;t them&s;elues naked, &s;ayth Tacitus, among &s;words and dangerous &s;peares. The yoong men doe long ab&s;taine from venerie; and Cae&s;ar reporteth that they e&s;teeme it a mo&s;t filthy thing to know a woman before they are twentie yeeres of age. Their marriages are &s;euere, they are content with one wife apiece; except a very few, which are oftener married for nobility than for lu&s;t. The hu&s;band offereth for a dowry to the wife, oxen and an hor&s;e ready bridled and &s;adled, with a buckler, iauelin, and &s;word. She is admoni&s;hed by the&s;e &s;ignes of matrimony, that &s;he commeth as a companion or con&s;ort of all labours and perils; both in peace and warre, that &s;he is to &s;uffer and attempt one and the &s;ame thing with her hu&s;band. Adulteries were very few, and tho&s;e thus pre&s;ently puni&s;hed: The hu&s;band (&s;ayth Tacitus) thru&s;teth his wife out of doores &s;tarke naked before her friends and kinred, with her haire quite cut off; and thus he whip|peth her cleane thorow the towne: whereupon it is manife&s;t that Sextus Empyrus lieth loudly, or at lea&s;t Gent. Heruetus his interpreter, where he writeth, that it is no &s;hame nor di&s;hone&s;ty amongst the Germans, but an ordinary thing, to commit ince&s;t and buggery. They giue not their mindes to hu&s;bandry, but all their life is hunting, that is their chiefe delight; yet Pliny writeth, that they v&s;ually &s;owe oats, and ordinarily v&s;e to eat no other pul&s;e. Tacitus wtne&s;&s;eth, that in Winter they &s;it all day long by the fir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ide. Cae&s;ar teacheth vs, that the greater part of their food con&s;i&s;teth of milke, fle&s;h and chee&s;e; and Appian &s;ayth, that in pouerty and di&s;tre&s;&s;e they are content with greene herbs and &s;allets. Mela addeth, that they feed al&s;o vpon raw fle&s;h. At dinner, as witne&s;&s;eth Athenaeus, they bring fle&s;h ro&s;ted in little pieces or gobbets; and vpon it they drinke milke and wine. Their di&s;hes are &s;imple and plaine, as veni&s;on new killed, wildings, and ca&s;t creame. Their drinke, &s;ayth Tacitus, is a liquor made of barley or wheat. Neither is there any nation more riotous in their Innes and dayly meetings. It is accounted a &s;hamefull thing and a great di&s;courte&s;ie to driue any man out of doores, or forbid any man to come to their hou&s;e: neither is it a di&s;grace for a man to &s;it tipling and drinking whole dayes and nights together. Yet this is now no woonder, &s;eeing, as Pliny &s;ayth, drunkenne&s;&s;e reigneth in euery corner of the world. I maruell that Athenaeus doth not name the Ger|mans in that his catalogue of to&s;pots and drunken nations, or are the&s;e &s;ober men in re&s;pect of tho&s;e? The richer &s;ort v&s;e no loo&s;e garments, but &s;o &s;trait and clo&s;e to their bodies, that one may tell their ribs and mu&s;cles, if they do but &s;tirre: the re&s;t do weare the skinnes of wilde bea&s;ts, which the ex|terior ocean or the vnknowen &s;ea begetteth. The very &s;ame is witne&s;&s;ed by Salu&s;t, who &s;ayth that they couer their bodies with garments of skinnes: as al&s;o by Cae&s;ar: but he with Tacitus addeth, that a great part of their bodies are cleane naked. This is manife&s;t out of the&s;e words of I&s;idore, <HI>Rheno|nes</HI> are certaine ve&s;tures or couerings for the &s;houlders and brea&s;t downe as low as the nauill, made like a rugge of cour&s;e wooll and haires, that they will keepe out a good &s;howre of raine. Varro perhaps &s;peaketh of the&s;e kinde of garments where he &s;ayth, that <HI>Rheno</HI> is a French garment: and Ser|uius vpon that of Virgil <HI>3.</HI> Georg. <HI>Et pecudum fuluis velantur corpora &s;etis, Rhenonibus,</HI> Their vpper parts are clad in rugge, or Rhenones made of cour&s;er wooll; iu&s;tifieth the &s;ame. For as Salu&s;t &s;ayth in his hi&s;tories, garments made of skinnes or pelts are called <HI>Rhenones.</HI> It &s;eemeth in Per&s;ius to be a kinde of bea&s;t, in this ver&s;e, <HI>E&s;&s;ed&aacute;que ingentes locat Cae&s;onia Rhenos.</HI> Interpreters vpon this place do vnder&s;tand by it the Ger|mans, becau&s;e, as they &s;ay, they do inhabit neere Rhene. But if it may be lawfull for this nation to take denomination from a riuer, it &s;hould be lawfull for them to be called rather Danubij, which runneth thorow their countrey, than of the Rheine, which belongeth as well to the French men as to the Germans. And that it is the name of a liuing creature, the &s;iluer money of C. Rhenius doth in a maner per&s;wade, in which a chariot with two wheeles is drawen of two bea&s;ts like goats. Olaus de&s;cribeth the <HI>Reynen</HI> certaine bea&s;ts &s;o called, which of Herber&s;teinius are named <HI>Rhen.</HI> Thus much by me concerning the&s;e bea&s;ts called <HI>Rhenones,</HI> let other men iudge otherwi&s;e if they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>Plutarch in <HI>6. Conuiual.</HI> writeth that they weare apparell only again&s;t fro&s;t and colde of Winter. Pomponius writeth, that the men do couer them|&s;elues with barkes of trees. And the &s;ame man with Tacitus writeth, that they all v&s;e a ca&s;&s;ocke for a couering, fa&s;tened together with a button or thorne, and that in their childhood they go naked, euen in the greate&s;t colde and dead of Winter. Neither is there any other habit for women than for men, but that the women oft times do couer them&s;elues with linnen garments. Pliny hath noted that they al&s;o &s;owe flax, and that the women make cloth of it; neither do they know any finer garment than that: and that they mingle it with purple. Euery mother giueth &s;ucke to her owne childe, neither are they committed to bondmaids and nur&s;es. We learne out of Eu&s;ebius &s;ixth booke <HI>de Praeparat.</HI> and out of S. Clements ninth booke <HI>de Recog.</HI> that they giue not them&s;elues to childi&s;h things, or any thing which they thought to be vnprofitable, as namely, to &s;tage-playes, painting, or mu|&s;icke. Yet they haue giuen them&s;elues to making of ver&s;es, but &s;uch as are rude and &s;imple, as witne&s;&s;eth the forenamed Iulian in the &s;ame <HI>Mi&s;opogo|nos.</HI> And this is one kinde of memoriall or Chronicle with them, as Tacitus witne&s;&s;eth. Otherwi&s;e they &s;pend their whole life in warlike and milita|ry exerci&s;es. We reade in Cae&s;ar, that robbery is not accounted as any infamy. And Seneca &s;ayth, they take care for nothing more than for armour and weapons. In the&s;e they are bred and borne, in the&s;e they are nouri&s;hed. If their countrey haue long peace, they do voluntarily go and offer their &s;er|uice to tho&s;e nations which do wage warre vpon any other, as Tacitus witne&s;&s;eth. They procure their mothers, children and wiues to bring vnto them being in fight, incouragements and meat and drinke, neither do they feare to &s;ucke and dre&s;&s;e their wounds. They begin the skirmi&s;h with &s;inging, &s;ound or cla&s;hing of their weapons, and dancings. They animate and encourage one another with &s;houting and loud hallowings. In battell they v&s;e long &s;peares and pikes, the weapons of the Alemans or <HI>Teutones,</HI> as Lucan in his &s;ixth booke affirmeth. To leaue his armour behinde him in the field was accounted the greate&s;t di&s;grace that might be, in&s;omuch that many after their returne home from the warre, haue ended that infamie with an hal|ter. Hence perhaps is that of Eu&s;ebius and S. Clement, which report, that many of the Germans do hang them&s;elues. Dion and Herodotus &s;ay that they v&s;ually &s;wimme ouer riuers: for the lightne&s;&s;e of their armour and the talne&s;&s;e of their bodies doth lift them vp, and beare them aboue the wa|ter, as Tacitus witne&s;&s;eth. Pliny teacheth that the pirats do &s;aile in &s;euerall hollow trees, whereof &s;ome one doth beare thirtie men apiece. The &s;ame man &s;ayth that there is yet a cu&s;tome with them, that the conquered giue an herbe to the conquerours. Appianus Alexandrinus &s;ayth they contemne death, by rea&s;on that they are per&s;waded that they &s;hall returne to life againe. Perhaps for that cau&s;e peraduenture it is, that Tacitus &s;peaketh thus of them: They de&s;ire no great funerals: that only is ob&s;erued, that the bodies of famous and better &s;ort of men may be burnt with &s;ome certeine kinde of wood. They heape vpon the fire neither garments nor any &s;weet &s;auours. Euery mans armour, and &s;ome mans hor&s;e al&s;o was ca&s;t into the fire. The &s;epulchre is rai&s;ed with turfs, &amp;c. They haue al&s;o a certaine kinde of puni&s;hment only v&s;ed here, as Tacitus &s;ayth, who writeth, that they hang traitours and runnagates vpon trees, but idle and lu&s;tie fellowes (Lip&s;ius readeth, big-limmed and lazie lubbers) they throw into puddles and fennes, ca&s;ting an hardle or grate ouer them. (Cae&s;ar in his &s;ixt booke <HI>de bello Gall.</HI> makes me imbrace that reading of Lip&s;ius, where, if I be not deceiued, he maketh them &s;lothfull, whom they account in the number of runnawayes, cowards and traitours: neither do I &s;ee how the&s;e differ; to accu&s;e a man for idlene&s;&s;e, and to make him infamous for &s;lothfull dulne&s;&s;e.) This is that diuer&s;itie of puni&s;hment, according to the diuer&s;ity of offences. They v&s;e not any &s;acrifices: and they count them only in the number of gods (if we may beleeue Cae&s;ar) whom they &s;ee, as the Sunne, the Moone, and Vulcan. But afterwards, as it is manife&s;t out of Tacitus, who liued vnder Verna the Emperour, they got them&s;elues other gods al&s;o, as Mercury, Hercules, (whom, if we may credit Lucian, they did call <HI>Ogmion</HI>) Mars, I&s;is, and the mother of the gods; be&s;ide one named Alcis. The &s;ame Tacitus ad|deth, that they accounted al&s;o Velleda and Aurinia amongst the number of their gods. Suidas mentioneth this, but that he readeth <HI>Beleda</HI> for <HI>Vel|leda.</HI> Theodo&s;ius out of Dion writeth, that the virgin <HI>Ganna</HI> gaue out oracles. He al&s;o heere maketh mention of the temple of <HI>Tanfannae.</HI> He &s;ayth that the <HI>Sueui</HI> (which is the greate&s;t nation of all Germany) did wor&s;hip the mother Earth, which (as Lip&s;ius readeth) they call <HI>A&euml;rtha,</HI> which yet is called <HI>Aerde.</HI> But they haue no images. Tertullian in his <HI>Apolog.</HI> writeth (if the reading be vncorrupt) that <HI>Belenus</HI> is the god of the No|rici. Plutarch, and out of him Clemens Alexandrinus, teacheth that they haue certaine holy women (Tacitus calleth them <HI>Agathias</HI> &amp; <HI>Polyaenus,</HI> Fortune-tellers, Prophete&s;&s;es) who did tell of things to come by the roaring, wirlings, and circumuolutions of riuers. It is very like that Cae&s;ar meant the&s;e &s;ame people, which he reporteth &s;ayd to Arioui&s;tus, that it was not lawfull for the Germans to ouercome, if they fought before the new moone. Hither are tho&s;e things to be referred which Strabo &s;peaketh of the Prophete&s;&s;es of the Cimbrians (people of Germanie) in his &s;euenth booke. Aeli|an in the &s;econd booke of his <HI>Var. hi&s;t.</HI> chap. <HI>31.</HI> hath noted that they foretell things to come, euen by birds, entrals of beasts, &s;ignes, and fore&s;peakings. Tacitus is witne&s;&s;e, that they made experimentall diuinings, euen by the neying of their hor&s;es. It is manife&s;t out of Suetonius his Domitian, that they had al&s;o Diuiners, which foretell by looking into the entrals of bea&s;ts. We reade in Tacitus, that at an appointed time they publikely &s;acrificed tho&s;e men, and that in their con&s;ecrated groues, and by calling on the names of their gods: which I al&s;o gather out of Claudian his fir&s;t booke of the prai&s;e of Stilicon, who calleth the&s;e woods, cruell by rea&s;on of their ancient religion. Tacitus al&s;o attributeth vnto the&s;e a certaine kinde of ca&s;ting of lots. Io&s;ephus in his eighth booke of Antiq. chap. <HI>8.</HI> doth tell a prety tale worth the reading, of a captiue &s;ouldier, concerning their skill in diuination by birds. And thus of many things we haue &s;elected the&s;e few particulars of Olde Germany, which hath now a new face, farre other fa&s;hions, rites and maners than at that time it had. Cae&s;ar will affoord more to the greedy Reader, but e&s;pecially Tacitus in his peculiar booke written of the Ger|mans. Moreouer, &s;ome things thou maye&s;t finde in a Panegyricke &s;peech made to Aurelius Maximianus the Emperour. The Epitome of Liuie in the <HI>104.</HI> booke, witne&s;&s;eth that he wrote of the &s;ituation and maners of Germanie. Caecilius reporteth, that Plinius Secundus his vncle wrote twentie books of the warres of Germanie. Agathias witne&s;&s;eth that A&s;inius Quadratus did mo&s;t curiou&s;ly de&s;cribe the e&s;tate of Germanie. But we hitherto
<PB REF="279"> want all the&s;e books of Pliny and Liuy. Notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome men of no reputation, which bragge that they haue tho&s;e bookes extant by them, and do &s;uffer them to lie hid and fight with wormes to the great iniurie and dammage to learnings common-wealth. Of this vanqui&s;hed, and yet inuincible Germanie, the&s;e men tooke their names or &s;urnames, to wit, Nero, Claudius, Dru&s;us, (of whom Ouid thus &s;peaketh, <HI>Et mortem &amp; nomen Dru&s;o Germania fecit:</HI> Great Dru&s;us was of Germane named, and there he li'th intomb'd.) Germanicus Cae&s;ar this mans &s;onne, Tiberius Cae&s;ar, C. Cae&s;ar, Nero, Vitellius, and Domitian; as Suetonius, Dion, Tacitus, and their coines do witne&s;&s;e. Item, Nerua, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Traian, M. Aurelius Antoninus, Commodus, Carocalla, Maximinus, Maximus his &s;onne, Gallienus, and Claudius; as their ancient coines doe plainly teach. Aurelian al&s;o, Maximilian, Valentinian, Valens and Gratian, as ancient &s;tones and in&s;criptions do te&s;tifie. La&s;tly, Valerius Maxi|minus and Eu&s;ebius in his ninth booke <HI>de Hi&s;tor. Eccle&s;.</HI> do auouch the &s;ame. In&s;omuch that the mo&s;t learned Iu&s;tus Lip&s;ius hath rightly ob&s;erued and noted vpon the fir&s;t booke of Tacitus Annals, that almo&s;t all the Emperours &s;ince Tiberius haue taken their &s;urnames from this mo&s;t warlike na|tion. I haue a piece of bra&s;&s;e money in which is the picture of M. Aurel. Antoninus, with this in&s;cription: <HI>M. ANTONINVS AVG. TR. P. XXV.</HI> on the backe &s;ide is a firre tree, neere which &s;tandeth <HI>Victorie,</HI> with a &s;hield in which is written <HI>VIC GER.</HI> and about the verge or skirt, <HI>IMP. VI. COSS. III.</HI> It is no maruell that Germanie &s;hould be &s;ignified, by the firre tree, for it is very common and familiar to this region: and Pliny de&s;cribeth the be&s;t of them all to be in the Alps; in that part or &s;ide as I coniecture which looketh toward Germany. For we haue ob&s;erued that few or none do grow, &s;car&s;e in any tract of the Alps, on that &s;ide toward Italie. And this is that Germanie, with which the Romane nation waged war from the yeere &s;ix hundred and fortie after the building of Rome, Caecilius Metallus and Papirius Carbo being Con&s;uls, euen vnto the yeere one thou|&s;and one hundred and &s;ixtie foure: at what time it was taken of the Goths, a people of Germanie, in the reigne of Honorius the Emperour. So long was this Germanie winning, that I may &s;o &s;peake with Tacitus, who doth freely confe&s;&s;e, that it was rather triumphantly conquered, than ba&s;ely van|qui&s;hed. That the di&s;po&s;ition of the countrey might the better be vnder&s;tood, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to adde the&s;e few hi&s;tories to the former. Of the <HI>SIMPLICITY</HI> of the&s;e people, out of Suetonius <HI>de Claudio.</HI> He being moued with the &s;implicitie and affiance of the Germans &s;uffered their am|ba&s;&s;adours to &s;it in chiefe roomes of the Theatre, for that being brought into the places where the comminaltie and common &s;ort v&s;ed to &s;it, they mar|king the Parthians and Armenians to &s;it amongst the Senatours, they boldly on their owne accord &s;tepped to tho&s;e higher places, affirming that their valour and eondition was nothing inferiour to theirs. Here al&s;o Tacitus in his 13. Annal. &s;peaking of the Fri&s;ian Germans, and being gone to Rome, while they wait and attend Nero's lea&s;ure, who was bu&s;ied about other matters, among tho&s;e things which are v&s;ually &s;hewed to Barbarians, they come to Pompies theatre, to &s;ee the great multitude of the people there a&s;&s;embled. There &s;itting idle (for they were delighted with playes like fooles) inqui|ring about the &s;itting in the li&s;ts, differences of &s;tates, demanding which is the gentleman, which is the Senatour, they ob&s;erued &s;ome in &s;trange appa|rell in the &s;eats of the Senatours: and asking who they &s;hould be, they vnder&s;tood, that that honour was giuen to the amba&s;&s;adours of tho&s;e nations which did excell in vertue and friend&s;hip with the Romans, they cried out aloud, <HI>NO MORTALL MEN MAY BE PREFERRED BEFORE THE GERMANS FOR VALOVR AND FIDELITIE:</HI> they &s;tep a&s;ide, leaue their &s;eats, and place them&s;elues among the Senatours: which was well taken of all the beholders: being held for a token of their ancient &s;pirit and courageous &s;tomacke. Nero made them free of the citie of Rome. Of their <HI>SECVRITIE, ex Arria. 1. Alexand.</HI> Alexander asked the Celtae (or Germans) what thing all the world mo&s;t feared? thinking that the greatne&s;&s;e of his power and name had pierced as farre as the Celtae, yea and farre beyond them, that they would haue an&s;wered, that they feared him aboue all men in the world be&s;ide. But the Celtae an&s;wered him farre otherwi&s;e than he expected: to wit, that they feared le&s;t heauen &s;hould fall vpon them, becau&s;e they liued farre from Alexander, and dwelt in places hard to come to, and that they &s;aw him make expedition another way. Ale|xander calling them friends and entertaining them into the number of his friends and confederates, &s;ent them home againe, adding this one thing, That the Celtae are proud and arrogant fellowes. Of their <HI>CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OVVNE STRENGTH, ex Cae&s;ar. Comment. lib. 4.</HI> The Germans &s;ayd that they did neither fir&s;t beginne warre with the Romans, neither do they refu&s;e to an&s;wer them, if they be prouoked, and to meet them where they will a&s;&s;igne; becau&s;e this is a cu&s;tome of the Germans continued from their ance&s;tours, to an&s;wer him who&s;oeuer &s;hall proclaime war again&s;t them, and neuer to offer conditions of peace vnto their enemies. Yet to &s;ay this, that they came vnwillingly thither, being that they were ca&s;t out of hou&s;e and home: if the Romans de&s;ired their friend&s;hip and amity, they might be able to &s;tand them in&s;tead and do them good &s;eruice: or els let them giue them lands, or at lea&s;twi&s;e &s;uffer them to hold tho&s;e which they haue gotten with their &s;words. They yeeld them&s;elues inferiour to none, but to the Sueui only, to whom they thinke the immortall gods are not equall: otherwi&s;e in earth, there is no nation whom they can not ouercome. Of their <HI>MAGNANIMITY ex L. Flor. lib. 3.</HI> What was the pride of Arioui&s;tus king of the Germans? When the amba&s;&s;adours &s;ayd, Come to Cae&s;ar: he an&s;wered, But who is Cae&s;ar? And if he will, let him come, &s;ayth he, him&s;elfe, what needeth he care how our Germanie doth? Doe I meddle with Romans?

<P>_IN <HI>Dion,</HI> an authour of good credit, and who &s;ometime, it is certaine, was Pre&s;ident of this country, I read that the <HI>PAN|NONES</HI> were &s;o named for that they v&s;ed to were &s;leeued coats made <HI>ex pannis,</HI> that is of patches or pieces of wollen cloth, cut and &s;la&s;hed after their manner and fa&s;hion, not v&s;uall in other countries.

In <HI>Hygenus</HI> I reade that a price and cu&s;tome was impo&s;ed vpon the&s;e lands accor|ding to the fertility and goodne&s;&s;e of euery aker: for there were fields of the fir&s;t and &s;econd price; woods yeelding yearely great plentie of maste; woods of the meane&s;t &s;ort of feed and pa&s;torage. &amp;c.

Yet he &s;aith they are a mo&s;t &s;tout and hardy people, but hauing nothing woorthy the name of hone&s;ty and ciuility, being generally very ha&s;ty and bloudy minded, killing and &s;laying without any re&s;pect or feare of God or man, and that vpon euery cro&s;&s;e word and light occa&s;ion. <HI>Solinus</HI> auoucheth the &s;ame to be true, &s;aying, that this country is very &s;trong and well furni&s;hed with couragious and &s;tout men. <HI>Tibullus</HI> in his fourth booke, &s;aith that they are a wily and crafty people. <HI>Statius</HI> and <HI>Paterculus</HI> called them, <HI>Feroces,</HI> fierce and cruell.

Euangelica,</HI> giueth out that the&s;e people, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that dwelt about <HI>Noricum, (Bauaria,</HI> or <HI>Bayern)</HI> did fir&s;t finde out the v&s;e of copper or bra&s;&s;e. <HI>Herodian</HI> &s;aith, that they are bigge bodied, very tall, ready to fight, and to kill and &s;lay vpon euery occa&s;ion: but of &s;o dull a conceit and &s;imple, that they doe not ea&s;ily perceiue whether one deale or &s;peake ought craftily and &s;ubtilly, or meane well and plainly. The Panegy|ricke of <HI>Mamertinus</HI> nameth this <HI>Pannony</HI> the Empre&s;&s;e of all nations for valour, and, like as <HI>Italy,</HI> renowmed for ancient honour. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith that this countrey yeeldeth great plenty of mast or akornes. The &s;ame authour al&s;o, in his historie of Nature hath left recorded, as if it were a matter of &s;ome mo|ment, that heere the herbe <HI>&s;aliunca,</HI> a kinde of lauender, doth naturally grow of it owne accord. <HI>Oppian</HI> commendeth the Pannonian dogges, which <HI>Ne|me&s;ianus</HI> in this ver&s;e affirmeth to be good hunters: <HI>Nec tibi Pannonicae &s;tirpis temnatur origo:</HI> The hounds heere bred are not the woor&s;t that ere I &s;ee. The Pannonian cappes made of bea&s;ts skinnes or furres, &s;uch as &s;ouldiours v&s;e to weare, <HI>Vegetius</HI> in his booke of warre doth highly commend. This country afterward <HI>Probus</HI> the Emperour permitted to haue vines, and by the helpe of the &s;ouldiers him&s;elfe did plant them in mount <HI>Almus (Arpatarro)</HI> neere <HI>Sermium (Sirmi&s;ch)</HI> the place where he was borne, as al&s;o vpon mount <HI>Aureus (Meczek)</HI> in <HI>Moe&s;ia &s;uperior (Seruia)</HI> as <HI>Sextus Aurelius Vi|ctor,</HI> in his life, doth te&s;tifie. In <HI>Paeonia,</HI> a prouince heere, abbuttant vpon mount <HI>Rhodope</HI> toward <HI>Macedony</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> the &s;oile is rich and fertile of golde, that many men haue found lumps of golde-ore of more then a pound weight. And in the confines of this country <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Admiranda</HI> doth write, that oftentimes the earth or vpper &s;oard being by continuall &s;howers wa&s;hed away, that kinde of golde which they call <HI>apyrum,</HI> (quicke-golde, if I may &s;o call it, &s;uch as haue not touched the fire) is found without digging or any other labour. But heere againe I doe al&s;o ob&s;erue an error very frequent amongst the Greeke writers, mi&s;taking <HI>Paeonia</HI> for <HI>Pannonia:</HI> For <HI>Pannonia</HI> or <HI>Hungary</HI> euen to this day is &s;o rich of golde, that it is wonderfull and &s;car&s;e to be belee|ued of &s;uch as haue not &s;eene it, as <HI>Bonfinius, Broderith,</HI> and <HI>Ranzan</HI> doe iointly affirme, who do all write that they haue &s;eene very many golden twigges of vines, &s;ome as long as ones finger, others of halfe a foote long: but of the richne&s;&s;e of <HI>Paeonia</HI> for mines of golde, I haue neuer heard nor read in any authour to my remembrance. <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> in the life of <HI>Pyrrhus Elien&s;is</HI> hath noted, that the <HI>Paeones</HI> doe v&s;e to ca&s;t the bodies of dead men into pondes or deepe pooles. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> in his eight and thirtieth oration writeth, that the <HI>Paeones</HI> did wor&s;hip the Sunne, and that the &s;igne or idoll of the &s;ame, which they adored; was a little di&s;h, put vpon the end of along pole and &s;et vpright. But whether this be meant of them, or of the <HI>Pannones</HI> (for that this authour is a Grecian) I know not, I leaue it to the con&s;ideration of the learned. The like is that place of <HI>Aelianus</HI> in the twelfth chapter of his &s;euenth booke <HI>de Animalibus,</HI> where he writeth a di&s;cour&s;e of the laborious painfulne&s;&s;e of the women of this countrey, well worth the reading and ob&s;eruation. <HI>Tzetzes</HI> al&s;o, in the three hundred and eighteenth chapter of his tenth Chiliade, nameth the <HI>Paeones</HI> for the <HI>Pannones,</HI> where he hath &s;omething perteining to this our purpo&s;e. <HI>Antigonus</HI> in his booke <HI>de Mirabilibus,</HI> writeth that in <HI>Illyria</HI> and <HI>Pannonia</HI> is that kinde of bea&s;t which they call <HI>Monychos: Aelianus</HI> termeth it <HI>Monops:</HI> Others, <HI>Bona&s;us. Diaconus</HI> in the eighth chapter of his &s;econd booke of the hi&s;torie of <HI>Lombardie</HI> writeth that <HI>Pannonia</HI> breed|eth great plenty of Buffes or Bugles, <HI>(Bi&s;ontes)</HI> and that he heard of an hone&s;t old man, that fifteene men haue beene knowen to lie together vpon one buffe hide, noting thereby the huge greatne&s;&s;e of this beast. And thus much of both tho&s;e <HI>Pannonia's:</HI> now it remaineth that in like maner we &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Illyris.</HI></P>
<P>This country is called of <HI>Ptolemey ILLYRIS:</HI> of <HI>Stephanus ILLYRIA, ILLYRIAE</HI> and <HI>ILLYRIVM:</HI> of Hi&s;torians and Geographers <HI>IL|LYRICVM. Valerius Maximus</HI> writeth, that one <HI>Alexander</HI> wrot a whole booke of the de&s;cription of this country. It was &s;o called, if we may giue credit to <HI>Appianus Alexandrinus,</HI> of <HI>Illyrius</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Polyphemus:</HI> or <HI>Cadmon,</HI> as <HI>Apollodorus</HI> and <HI>Stephanus</HI> doe thinke. The bounds of this prouince are by diuers diuer&s;ly a&s;&s;igned. For <HI>Ptolemey</HI> confineth it with the Hadriaticke &s;ea, <HI>I&s;tria,</HI> the two <HI>Pannonies,</HI> and mount <HI>Scardus, (Marinai,</HI> they now call it.) <HI>Pliny</HI> endeth it at the city <HI>Li&s;&s;us (Ale&s;io.) Pomponius</HI> maketh it to begin at <HI>Terge&s;tum, (Trie&s;te,</HI> a city of <HI>Friuli,)</HI> and to end at the riuer <HI>Aea,</HI> which is neere <HI>Apollonia, (Si&s;&s;opoli,</HI> a towne of <HI>Macedony</HI> in <HI>Greece.) Martianus</HI> extendeth it yet further, namely euen vp as high as the Ceraunian mountaines, as in like manner <HI>Strabo</HI> doth. <HI>Suetonius</HI> in the life of <HI>Tiberius</HI> writeth thus of the bounds of this country; <HI>ILLYRICVM,</HI> which lieth betweene <HI>Italy,</HI> and the kingdome of <HI>Noricum; (Bayern) Thrace,</HI> and <HI>Macedony,</HI> the riuer <HI>Donawe</HI> and the gulfe of <HI>Venice.</HI> And <HI>Ap|pian</HI> he maketh it yet more large, &s;tretching it out in length from the head of the riuer <HI>I&s;ter, (Donawe</HI> euen vnto the Ponticke &s;ea, <HI>(Mar Maiore.) Sex|tus Rufus</HI> who liued in the time of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the Roman Emperour comprehendeth vnder the name of <HI>Illyricum</HI> the&s;e &s;euenteene prouinces: Tho&s;e two of the <HI>Norici,</HI> the two <HI>Pannonies, Valetia, Sauia, Dalmatia, Moe&s;ia,</HI> the two <HI>Dacia's, Macedonia, The&s;&s;alia, Achaia,</HI> the two <HI>Epiri, Praeualis</HI> and <HI>Creta.</HI> Thus much of the name and limits of this country out of diuers authours.</P>

<P>We in this Mappe haue expre&s;&s;ed only <HI>Ptolemey's Illyricum,</HI> which hee diuideth into two parts, namely into <HI>LIBVRNIA</HI> and <HI>DALMATIA, Liuy</HI> in his &s;ixe and fortieth booke, according to the people and inhabitants of the &s;ame, diuideth it into three parts: of the nature of which prouince <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth in this maner: All the &s;ea coast of <HI>Illyricum</HI> is well furni&s;hed with fit and commodious hauens: both the maine land, I meane, and the ilands neere adioyning to the &s;ame. The &s;oile is very fertile of all maner of fruits and rich commodities, e&s;pecially of oliues and &s;trong wines. The countrey that is &s;ituate about this, is wholly mountainous, colde, and couered with &s;nowe; &s;o that vines are heere very rare, either in the high grounds or plaines and vallies. Where|upon <HI>Propertius</HI> not altogether vnfitly called it <HI>Gelida Illyria,</HI> Bleak and frozen <HI>Illyria: Appian</HI> nameth the people <HI>Incolas bellico&s;i&s;imos,</HI> a most warlike and couragious people. <HI>Liuy</HI> &s;aith that they are a very hardy nation both by &s;ea and land: <HI>Florus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh them cruell and bloudy men, and much giuen to robbe and &s;teale. <HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperor in his di&s;cour&s;e <HI>de Cae&s;aribus,</HI> te&s;tifieth plainly that they are one of the &s;toute&s;t and valiante&s;t nati|ons of all <HI>Europe. Vegetius</HI> recordeth that there were alwaies re&s;ident in <HI>Illyria</HI> two legions called <HI>Martiobarbuli:</HI> the&s;e <HI>Diocletian</HI> and <HI>Maximinian</HI> Emperours of <HI>Rome</HI> named afterward <HI>Iouiani,</HI> and <HI>Herculei:</HI> and they were preferred before all other legions what&s;oeuer. <HI>Illyricis &s;udant equitatibus alae;</HI> as <HI>Claudian</HI> reporteth in the commendations of <HI>Serena. Lampridius</HI> maketh them well &s;eene and renowmed for their skill in &s;ooth&s;aying, and diui|ning of euents to come, when he writeth, that <HI>Alexander Seuerus</HI> excelled this nation in that skill. <HI>I&s;ogonus</HI> in <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth that there be a kinde of men amongst the&s;e which doe bewitch with their eies, and doe kill &s;uch as they doe beholde and looke vpon any long while together: e&s;pecially &s;uch of them as haue firie eies, like tho&s;e which are moued with anger, and the&s;e kind of people haue two &s;ights in ech eye. <HI>Aelianus</HI> &s;aith that they are great wine bibbers, and, as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> reporteth, very much giuen to drunkenne&s;&s;e. Of the maidens and wiues of this countrey &s;ee <HI>Varro</HI> in the &s;ixteenth chapter of his &s;econd booke. <HI>Claudian</HI> in his &s;econd panegyricke to <HI>Stilico</HI> &s;ignifieth that they were permitted about the raigne of the latter Emperours, to haue vines, where he thus writeth: <HI>Exectis inculta dabant quas &s;ecula &s;yluis, Re&s;tituit terras, &amp; opacum vitibus I&s;trum Con&s;erit.</HI> Which was done, as &s;eemeth, about the time of the Emperour <HI>Probus.</HI> In <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> I finde mention made of <HI>Sabaia,</HI> the drinke of the poorer &s;ort of people, which they made of barley or wheat turned into a liquour or kinde of woort. <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> in his fir&s;t booke of his Stromaton, hath recorded that the&s;e people fir&s;t found out that weapon which the Romans called <HI>Pelta,</HI> a kinde of &s;hield or target. The kine heere euery yeare doe bring two or three calues a piece, and &s;ome foure; yea &s;ome fiue or more at once: and doe giue &s;o much milke at a meale, that euery day one cowe yeeldeth more then a large gallon. Againe, the hennes doe not lay only once a day, but &s;ome two or three egges a peece euery day, as <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Admiranda</HI> plainly affirmeth. <HI>Aelianus</HI> writeth that he had heard by re|port from others, that their goats heere are whole footed, not clouen as in other places. <HI>Pliny</HI> recordeth that heere groweth the be&s;t <HI>Gentian,</HI> a kinde of bit|terwoort, or hearbe, who&s;e root is of great vertue and reque&s;t in phy&s;icall v&s;es. The &s;ame authour commendeth the cockles of <HI>Illyria</HI> for their extraordinarie greatne&s;&s;e. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> te&s;tifieth that heere in the high countrey far from the &s;ea, groweth the be&s;t and goodlie&s;t Lychnis, or Ro&s;e campaine. <HI>Ouid</HI> in his &s;e|cond booke <HI>de Arte Amandi,</HI> doth much commend the Illyrian pitch. <HI>Theophra&s;tus, Cornelius Cel&s;us, Ouid,</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius Vticen&s;is,</HI> doe mention the Illyrian flower-de-luce, an hearbe, be&s;ide his beauty, of &s;oueraigne v&s;e in Phy&s;icke: the be&s;t of which, and that which is of greate&s;t e&s;timation, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, groweth in the wildes and woods about the riuers <HI>Drilo (Drino,</HI> or <HI>Lodrino)</HI> and <HI>Narona,</HI> now called <HI>Narcuta.</HI> In <HI>Illyria,</HI> if one may beleeue <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> in the word <HI>Hippius,</HI> euery ninth yeare they were woont to throw foure hor&s;es into the &s;ea, as a &s;acrifice to <HI>Neptune,</HI> great commander of the &s;ame. <HI>Diony&s;ius Vticen&s;is</HI> and <HI>Caelius Apitius</HI> doe &s;peake of <HI>oleum Liburnicum,</HI> a kind of oile made heere. The &s;ame author telleth vs of a cold &s;pring or well in <HI>Illyria,</HI> ouer which if a man &s;hall &s;pread any clothes they will burne, and at length be cleane con&s;umed. And thus much generally of <HI>Illyria:</HI> now it remai|neth that we &s;peake a word or two of <HI>Liburnia</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the &s;euerall parts of the &s;ame: who&s;e beginning and ending, as <HI>Florus</HI> thinketh, is at the ri|uer <HI>Titius, (Cercha,</HI> or <HI>Poli&s;cha:)</HI> or at the city <HI>Scardona (Scardo)</HI> &s;ituate vpon the banke of that riuer, as <HI>Ptolemey, Dio&s;corides, Galen</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> do thinke. <HI>Liburnia</HI> is renowmed for tho&s;e kinde of &s;hippes which heere were fir&s;t made and v&s;ed, and therefore were named <HI>Naues Liburnicae:</HI> they &s;eeme to haue beene like vnto our pinnaces or foi&s;ts, light and &s;wift of &s;aile, and therefore were good for pirates and &s;ea-robbers: and <HI>Vegetius</HI> in his booke of warre writeth that they were held to be the be&s;t kinde of &s;hippes for &s;eruice and fight vpon the &s;ea, and therefore in warre to be preferred before any other kinde of &s;hipping what&s;oeuer: this al&s;o <HI>Appian</HI> doth confirme, who &s;aith that for lightne&s;&s;e and &s;wiftne&s;&s;e they did farre &s;urpa&s;&s;e any other. And <HI>Zo&s;imus</HI> writeth that they were as quicke of &s;aile as tho&s;e gallies that were forced and rowed with fifty oares: but in this he is deceiued, that he thinketh them to haue beene &s;o named of a certaine city in <HI>Italy. Apitius</HI> telleth vs, as we &s;aid before, of a Liburnian oile, v&s;ed, as &s;eemeth, about &s;ome &s;eruices in the kitchin. Of the iron mines in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> &s;ee <HI>Ca&s;&s;iodore</HI> in his third booke <HI>Variarum,</HI> dedicated to <HI>Symeon.</HI> The&s;e ver&s;es of <HI>Statius</HI> in his <HI>Siluae,</HI> doe &s;hew that it hath al&s;o &s;ome veines of golde: <HI>Quando te dulci Latio remittent Dalmatae montes, Vbi Dite vi&s;o Pallidus fo&s;&s;or redit, eruto&abque; Concolor auro.</HI> So doth the poet <HI>Martiall</HI> in the three&s;core and eighteenth Epigram of his tenth booke vnto <HI>Macer,</HI> in the&s;e words: <HI>Ibis littoreas Macer Salonas: Felix auriferae co|lone terrae:</HI> yet <HI>Strabo</HI> plainly te&s;tifieth that they v&s;ed no maner of mony or coines either of &s;iluer or golde. Moreouer, he affirmeth that euery eighth yeere they make a new diui&s;ion of their lands. There are in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> as <HI>Cicero</HI> to <HI>Vatinius</HI> writeth, twenty ancient townes, which al&s;o haue gotten vnto them more than three&s;core other townes. The rape roote and per&s;nep do grow of their owne accord about <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> without &s;etting, &s;owing or manuring, as <HI>Athe|naeus</HI> in his ninth booke Deipno&s;ophi&s;ton, out of the authoritie of <HI>Po&s;idonius,</HI> affirmeth. For &s;o <HI>Delachampius</HI> tran&s;lateth the Greeks word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, not v&s;ed of any other writer to my knowledge. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his often cited <HI>Admiranda,</HI> giueth vs to vnder&s;tand that the <HI>Taulantij,</HI> a people of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> did v&s;e of hony to make a kinde of wine: for taking the hony-combes and powring water vpon them, they pre&s;&s;e and wring out the liquor, which they pre&s;ently &s;eethe in a great kettle and caldron, vntill the one halfe of it be con&s;umed, then they put it into earthen ve&s;&s;els and &s;o let it &s;tand for a certaine time: la&s;tly, they tunne it vp into barrels or treene ve&s;&s;els, and &s;o they keepe it for a long time, vntill it get the true and perfect ta&s;te of a &s;trong kinde of wine. The &s;ame authour in the &s;ame place writeth, that amongst the <HI>Ardiaei,</HI> a people of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> in the confines neere to the <HI>Autariatae,</HI> there is a great mountaine, and neere to that as great a valley, out of which water runneth in great abundance; yet not at all times, but in the &s;pring time only: which in the day time they powre in|to a ve&s;&s;ell, and keepe it clo&s;e within the hou&s;e, at night they &s;et it abroad in the open aire vncouered: which being done for &s;ix daies together, at la&s;t it congea|leth, and becommeth as fine &s;alt as may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;eene. <HI>Pliny</HI> in the skirts of <HI>Dalmatia</HI> placeth a caue which he calleth <HI>Senta,</HI> with a wide deepe mouth, into which if one &s;hall ca&s;t any thing though neuer &s;o light, and in a day neuer &s;o calme, pre&s;ently there ri&s;eth a &s;torme like to a whirlewind. Hither peraduenture belongeth that fable of the two rocks of which <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer</HI> &s;peaketh. In the &s;ame countrey there is a hole called <HI>Diana's</HI> caue, in which, if one may be|leeue <HI>Phlegon Trallianus,</HI> there are many dead bodies, the ribbes of which are more then &s;ixteene eles long a piece. Giue him the whet&s;tone. Thus farre of this countrie and the people of the &s;ame, collected out of the mo&s;t ancient authours that are extant and haue come to our hands. Latter writers haue na|med this <HI>Illyria, SLAVONIA,</HI> and the people or inhabitants of the &s;ame, <HI>SLAVONES, Slauonians:</HI> by which name, being reclaimed from the barba|rous inciuility of other nations, and by holy bapti&s;me incorporated into the body of Chri&s;ts Church, in the time of <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and his &s;onne <HI>Leo,</HI> who &s;ucceeded him in that Empire, they are de&s;cribed in the eighteenth chapter of that his booke <HI>de Bellico apparatu,</HI> where he thus &s;etteth out their nature and manner of life: It is a populous nation, able to indure all maner of mi&s;eries; heat, colde, raine, nakedne&s;&s;e, want of meat, drinke and other &s;uch like nece&s;&s;ary things, they can ea&s;ily abide. They were woont to be humane &amp; courteous to &s;trangers: which ho&s;pitality they do very diligenly mainetaine and keepe euen to this day: for they alwaies v&s;ed to &s;hew them&s;elues gentle and kinde to trauellers and &s;trangers, to entertaine them friendly and courteou&s;ly, and to goe with them and conduct them from place to place, to defend and keepe them &s;afe and &s;ound from all hurt and danger. So that if a traueller were wronged by the negligence of his ho&s;t, they pre&s;ently made warre vpon him, as again&s;t a publike enemy. For they held it for a great argument of fidelity, if the wrong done to a &s;tranger were righted or any kinde of way reuenged. Moreouer, this al&s;o doth &s;hew them to be humaine, in that they do not binde their cap|tiues to a perpetuall &s;eruitude, but rather they detained and kept them with them as captiues, and pre&s;cribed them a certaine &s;et time of their &s;eruitude, after which being expired, paying a certaine fine or peece of mony, they might if they plea&s;ed returne home to their owne countrie againe: or, if they thought good, &s;tay &s;till among&s;t them as frinds and freemen. Their women are &s;aid to be very mode&s;t aboue tho&s;e of other countries: for many of them doe take the death of their hu&s;bands &s;o heauily, that they will die with them, and one way or other make an end of their liues with them: for they cannot abide to liue as widowes alone after their hu&s;bands death, and to marry the &s;econd time that is counted a foule &s;hame. Their ordinary fare is millet: they are very temperate and &s;pa|ring in their diet. Other toiles of hu&s;bandry they cannot away withall: for they loue to liue more freely and gentlemanlike: by no meanes they will be drawen with great labour and trauell to prepare great and &s;umptuous banquets and dainties, and then when they haue done, to eat and drinke them vp. In warre they arme them&s;elues with two iauelings or darts a peece.

<P>_THey which v&s;e to compare the &s;ituation of countries to other things do liken <HI>Italy</HI> to an oken leafe, as <HI>Pliny, Solinus</HI> and <HI>Rutilius</HI> haue done: or to an iuy leafe, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius.</HI> The later writers do more truly liken it to a mans legge. One in our time hath de&s;cribed all <HI>Europe</HI> in the form of a maiden, in who&s;e right arme <HI>Italy</HI> is portraitured: and not vnfitly, in my opinion, if one do exactly con&s;ider the nature of the country and famous acts done in the &s;ame: for euen as the &s;trength of the body doth for the mo&s;t part &s;hew his force and ability in this member; &s;o this prouince in times pa&s;t de|clared to the world by this his arme, of what power all <HI>Europe</HI> the whole body is likely to be.</P>
<P>That <HI>Italy</HI> hath had diuers inhabitants, partly Barbarians and partly Grecians, it is manife&s;t out of the ancient records both of Latines and Greekes. For at the fir&s;t it was inhabited by the <HI>Aborigi|nes, Siculi, Pela&s;gi, Arcades, Epei, Troiani, Morgetes, Au&s;ones</HI> and <HI>Oenotri.</HI> And therefore it was cal|led by diuers and &s;undry names: as, AVSONIA, OENOTRIA, of the people and nations po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it: IANICVLA, of <HI>Ianus:</HI> SATVRNIA, of <HI>Saturne:</HI> and la&s;tly, ITALIA (which it &s;till retaineth) of <HI>Italus</HI> their King, or as <HI>Varro</HI> witne&s;&s;eth of buls or oxen: for the ancient Gretians did in tho&s;e daies call buls, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">: and becau&s;e that this country did breed and maintaine many goodly buls, it was of them called <HI>Italia:</HI> or, (as others affirme, which more regard poeticall fables) for that <HI>Hercules</HI> from <HI>Si|cilia</HI> hither followed a worthy bull, which was named <HI>Italus.</HI> Of the Greekes al&s;o it was named HESPERIA, of <HI>He&s;perus,</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Atlas:</HI> or, which plea&s;eth others better, of <HI>He&s;perus</HI> the euening &s;tarre: whereof al&s;o in old time <HI>Spaine</HI> was called <HI>He|&s;peria.</HI> For, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that <HI>Italy</HI> was &s;ometime of the Grecians called <HI>He&s;peria,</HI> was <HI>Spaine</HI> of the Latines called <HI>He&s;pe|ria.</HI> Yet for di&s;tinction &s;ake, <HI>Virgil,</HI> in the fir&s;t and &s;euen bookes of his Aeneiads, calleth <HI>Italy, He&s;periam Magnam,</HI> Great <HI>He&s;pe|ria.</HI> But it was al&s;o by others named by other names. For I &s;ee that of <HI>Macrobius, Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus, Marcus Cato, I&s;aac Tzetzes &amp;c.</HI> it was called APENINA, ARGESSA, CAMESENA, TVRSENIA, SALEVMBRONA and, TAVRINA. <HI>Stepha|nus</HI> writeth that it was called CHONIA and BRETTIA. A part al&s;o of it was called by writers of good note MAGNA GRAE|CIA, <HI>Great Greece,</HI> of the Grecians that &s;ometime dwelt in it. They report, as <HI>Aelianus</HI> writeth, that there haue dwelt heere &s;o many and &s;undrie nations (more than in any other country of the world) by rea&s;on e&s;pecially, that all times and &s;ea&s;ons of the yeare are very mild and temperate: againe, for that the goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile is excellent, well watered, and very fertile of all maner of fruites, and yeeldeth great &s;tore of pa&s;torage: <HI>Item,</HI> becau&s;e it is cro&s;&s;ed with many riuers, and hath the &s;ea very com|modious lying round about it, and the &s;ea coa&s;t on all &s;ides open, and cut into &s;undrie baies, inlets, creekes and hauens, &s;eruing very fitly for the entertainment and harborough of goodly tall &s;hippes. La&s;tly, the extraordinary kindne&s;&s;e and humanity of the people inhabiting it, hath been a great meanes to draw others to &s;eat them&s;elues heere. The Italians were euer, as <HI>Iulius Firmicus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, very famous for their princely curte&s;ie and gentlemanlike behauiour.</P>
<P><HI>Aethicus</HI> calleth this country <HI>Heauenly Italy,</HI> and <HI>The Queen of the World; Rutilius, Rerum dominam,</HI> The mi&s;tre&s;&s;e of all Nations: <HI>Dion Pru&s;aeus, The mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed and happie country of all</HI> Europe: <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> in his fir&s;t booke, &s;aith, that for many rea&s;ons, <HI>It is the be&s;t country of the whole World. Strabo</HI> &s;aith, <HI>That none may &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;e in wordes the due commendati|ons of this country, according to the worth of the &s;ame.</HI> But I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to &s;et out the prai&s;es of this country by this one commendation of <HI>Pliny,</HI> wherewith he concludeth that his famous worke which he wrote of the hi&s;tory of Nature. <HI>In the whole World,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>the cope of heauen,</HI> Italy <HI>is the mo&s;t beautifull country, and of all things it doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the &s;oueraignty: it is another nurce and mother of the World, for men, women, captaines, &s;ouldiers, &s;eruants, famous arts and occupations, worthy wittes and inuentions, commodious &s;ituation, whole&s;omene&s;&s;e and temperature of the aire, ea&s;ie acce&s;&s;e of all nations, many &s;afe hauens, kind bla&s;ts of windes, &s;ufficient good water, plea&s;ant and healthfull woods, goodly hils and mountaines, great &s;tore of deere and wild bea&s;ts, and tho&s;e harmele&s;&s;e, fertility of &s;oile, and multitude of people. What&s;oeuer is nece&s;&s;arily required for the main|tenance of man and bea&s;t is heere to be found, and no where better. Corne, Wine, Oliues, Wooll, Linnen, Woollen and Bullockes. Neither did I euer &s;ee better hor&s;es, or more e&s;teemed at the runnings or hor&s;e-races, than tho&s;e bred in our owne country. For met|tals, as Gold, Siluer, Copper and Iron, (&s;o long as they plea&s;ed to &s;earch for them) it was inferiour vnto none, all which it &s;till re|taineth in her wombe. Now it yeeldeth all maner of liquors of &s;undrie force and vertue, together with all &s;orts of graine and plea&s;ant tooth&s;ome fruites.</HI> Thus farre <HI>Pliny.</HI> You may adde to the&s;e, if you plea&s;e, that which the &s;ame authour writeth in the fifth chapter of his third booke: <HI>Item,</HI> that of <HI>Polybius</HI> in his &s;econd booke: of <HI>Varro</HI> in the &s;econd chapter of his fir&s;t booke of Hu&s;|bandrie: of <HI>Strabo</HI> neere the end of his &s;ixth booke; and la&s;tly of <HI>Virgil</HI> in diuers place. <HI>Si factum certa mundum ratione fate|mur, Con&s;iliumqu&egrave; Dei machina tanta fuit:</HI> If that we &s;hall confe&s;&s;e that heauen by heauenly skill was rai&s;'d, And in the &s;ame the ma&s;&s;ie globe by due proportion pai&s;'d: as <HI>Rutilius</HI> in his &s;econd booke &s;peaketh of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Octauianus Augustus,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth, diuided this country into eleuen &s;hires: <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, as <HI>Rubeus,</HI> in his &s;econd booke of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Rauenna,</HI> &s;aith, into &s;euenteen. Or, into eighteen, as I read in the one and twentieth chapter of the &s;econd booke of <HI>Diaconus</HI> his hi&s;tory of <HI>Lombardy. Aelianus</HI> writeth that it was beautified in his time, with 1197. cities. This is that &s;ame countrie, which, when word was brought of the ri&s;ing of the Gauls, at what time as <HI>L.

<HEAD>ITALY of the GAVLS.</HEAD>
<P>_THis part of <HI>Italy</HI> in times pa&s;t was called <HI>Gallia.</HI> For the old writers did extend the borders of <HI>Gallia</HI> from the ocean &s;ea ea&s;tward euen to the riuer <HI>Rubicon (Runcone</HI> or <HI>Rugo&s;o)</HI> There|fore the Alpes running through the midde&s;t of it diuideth it into two parts: this they call TRANSALPINA, and <HI>Gallia vlterior, Gallia</HI> beyond the Alpes, or the further <HI>Gallia:</HI> this which we haue heere &s;et out in this mappe, CISALPINA, <HI>Subalpina</HI> and <HI>Citerior, Gallia</HI> on this &s;ide the Alpes, vnder the Alpes, or the hither <HI>Gallia. Au&s;onius</HI> nameth it <HI>Gallia the Old;</HI> &s;o doth <HI>Solinus,</HI> where he writeth that the <HI>Vmbri</HI> are an ancient i&s;&s;ue and branch &s;prong from the old Gauls. <HI>Liuy</HI> in his 45. booke nameth it <HI>Gallia,</HI> without any addition. And for that all this part, in proce&s;&s;e of time was comprehended vnder the name of <HI>Italy:</HI> therefore of <HI>Appian</HI> in his <HI>Annibalica,</HI> it is called by a fit name, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from that other part, ITALIA GALLICA. The booke of records of the Prouinces nameth it, ITALIA MEDITERRANEA <HI>Midland Italy.</HI> In this part was al&s;o conteined that prouince, which was called GALLIA TOGATA. Moreouer this was named ARI|MINIVM, as you may read in the 28. booke of <HI>Liuies</HI> Decades, except the place be corrupt. <HI>Silius Italicus,</HI> in his 9. booke, calleth the people of this place, <HI>Celtes, dwelling vpon the riuer Eridanus</HI> or <HI>Po.</HI> In this circuite of ground (which <HI>Tacitus</HI> nameth the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing &s;ide of <HI>Italy</HI>) are the Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Eleuenth &s;hires of <HI>Italy,</HI> according to the diui&s;ion of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> This &s;elfe &s;ame tract is of the riuer <HI>Padus (Po)</HI> which watereth it, and diuideth it in the midde&s;t, diuided into two parts, namely, GALLIA TRANSPADANA and CISPADANA, <HI>Gallia beyond the Po,</HI> and <HI>Gallia on this &s;ide the Po.</HI> This later, <HI>Ci&s;padana</HI> alone, in <HI>Ptolemey</HI> doth conteine that which otherwi&s;e was called <HI>Toga|ta.</HI> Vnder this diui&s;ion were the <HI>Ligures</HI> comprehended: who, as we haue ob&s;erued in ancient writers, long &s;ince dwelt vp as high as the riuer <HI>Po.</HI> If there be any credit to be giuen to the <HI>Origines,</HI> a booke which commonly goeth vnder the name of <HI>Cato,</HI> this &s;ame prouince was al&s;o called AEMILIA, FELSINA, AVRELIA and BIANORA. <HI>Polybi|us</HI> &s;aith, that the forme of this whole tract of <HI>Gallia,</HI> is triangular or three cornered: who&s;e toppe or <HI>vertex,</HI> as the Geo|metricians call it, is made by the meeting of the Alpes and Apenninus, that mountaine that runneth through the mid|de&s;t of <HI>Italy</HI> from one end to the other. The ba&s;e or ground line, is the Hadriaticke &s;ea <HI>(Golfo di Venetia).</HI> Moreouer he addeth that in it are the greate&s;t champion plaines and mo&s;t fertile fields of all <HI>Europe.</HI> It is euery where full of woods, good pa&s;torage for the feeding of cattell, and well watered with many plea&s;ant brookes and riuers, and hath had in it twelue great and goodly cities, &s;o built and &s;eated that they had all things nece&s;&s;ary either for the enriching of them|&s;elues conueniently, or maintenance and proui&s;ion for to liue gallantly, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> doth witne&s;&s;e in the life of <HI>Camillus.</HI> The &s;ame al&s;o <HI>Pliny</HI> doth affirme, who in like maner &s;aith that it is three cornered: and as in <HI>Delta,</HI> a prouince of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the riuer <HI>Nilus:</HI> &s;o heere <HI>Po,</HI> doth emptie it &s;elfe and falleth into the ocean &s;ea. Which riuer <HI>Po,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith, doth water this plaine, maketh it fertile, and al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;heth it by many mo&s;t fruitfull hils, into diuers and &s;un|drie parts. This is that riuer which antiquity called <HI>Eridanus,</HI> famous for the poeticall or fabulous &s;tory of <HI>Pha&euml;ton. Virgil</HI> calleth it, <HI>The king of Riuers. Claudian</HI> giueth it the title of <HI>Oloriferus,</HI> the &s;wanne-bearing &s;treame. <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth it <HI>Auriferum,</HI> the golden &s;treame, and moreouer &s;aith, that for clearene&s;&s;e it is not inferiour to any riuer what&s;oeuer. It i&s;&s;ueth out of the bo&s;ome of <HI>Ve&s;ulus, (Ve&s;o)</HI> the highe&s;t hill of all the Alpes: where fir&s;t ari&s;ing out of many &s;mall fountaines, it draweth to head, then hiding it &s;elfe or running vnderneath the ground for many furlongs together, at la&s;t ri&s;eth againe not farre from <HI>Forum-Vibij</HI> or <HI>Vibi Forum.</HI> From thence (many huge lakes emptying tnem&s;elues into it) accompanied with thirty other riuers, it vnladeth it &s;elfe by manie mouthes into the Hadriaticke bay or Gulfe of <HI>Ve|nice:</HI> into which it falleth &s;o &s;wiftly and with &s;uch violence, that forcing backe the billowes and tide, it keepeth his own channell in the &s;ea, and, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> &s;peaketh, maketh the waters fre&s;h and potable amid the bracki&s;h &s;urges of the &s;ame. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, that in the Ligurian language it was named <HI>Bodincus,</HI> that is, (as <HI>Scep&s;ius</HI> there doth interpret it) Bottomle&s;&s;e. In the&s;e quarters, among&s;t others, the Gauls did &s;ometimes dwell, who fir&s;t of all mortall men made war vpon the Romanes, tooke the city of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;acked and burnt it, the Capitoll onely being pre&s;erued vntouched. This is that part of <HI>Italy,</HI> which, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth to his familiar friend <HI>Iunius Mauricus,</HI> retaineth euen to this day much of that ancient frugality and good husbandrie of our ance&s;tours. In the fifth booke of <HI>Straboes</HI> Geographie, and in the &s;econd booke of <HI>Polybius</HI> hi&s;tory you haue an excellent and large de&s;cription of this country. Of <HI>Venice,</HI> a &s;hire of this prouince, read <HI>Ca&s;siodore</HI> in the foure and twentieth &s;ection of his twelfth booke. <HI>Bonauentura Ca&s;tilloneus</HI> and <HI>Gauden|tius Merula,</HI> borne heere, in this our age haue much graced and painted out this part in their learned writings, and &s;e|uerall tracts written of the &s;ame. They which are delighted with tales and fables, let them repaire to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who, in his booke intituled <HI>Admiranda,</HI> hath certaine things of the <HI>Electrides,</HI> (a few &s;mall ilands &s;uppo&s;ed by the ancients to be in this Gulfe, but fal&s;ly as we haue &s;hewed before) and of Dawes or Choughs which do &s;tocke vp the &s;eed new &s;owen. Of the&s;e al&s;o <HI>Theopompus</HI> &s;peaketh in the &s;ixteenth chapter of the &s;euenteenth booke of <HI>Aelian de Animalibus.</HI></P>
<P>Of LIGVRIA, heere &s;ome thing might well be &s;aid, if &s;o be that this mappe did containe it all: but becau&s;e a piece of it only is heere expre&s;&s;ed (for in time pa&s;t as good authours do record, it extended his borders beyond <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> and the riuer <HI>Eridanus,</HI> or <HI>Po</HI>) therefore of it we will &s;urcea&s;e to &s;peake much in this place. Only I will &s;et downe an ancient in&s;cription cut in a plate of bra&s;&s;e, found in this prouince long &s;ince, for that it conteineth many names of places of the precinct of <HI>Genua,</HI> mentioned in this mappe and no where el&s;e read in any authour what&s;oeuer. And for that the anti|quity of it (although I &s;u&s;pect that al&s;o) is the greate&s;t matter to be admired, I will only &s;et it downe in the &s;ame maner as it was deliuered by <HI>Ortelius.</HI> Thus it is expre&s;&s;ed word for word by <HI>Stunica:</HI></P>

<P>_THe length of this country is bounded by two riuers; with <HI>Tiber</HI> on the Ea&s;t: and <HI>Macra (Magra)</HI> on the We&s;t: on the South it hath the Tu&s;cane &s;ea (<HI>Mare Tu&s;cum,</HI> or <HI>Tyrrhenum;</HI> now <HI>mar To&s;co</HI>) For although, as <HI>Liuy</HI> and <HI>Polybius</HI> do te&s;tifie, before the Romane Empire it was more large, and extended his bounds beyond the Appenine mountaines, euen as farre as <HI>Atria (Atri)</HI> whereof the Atreaticke &s;ea, (<HI>Hadriaticus &s;inus,</HI> the bay of <HI>Hadria, Golfo di Venetia</HI>) tooke the name: yet afterward being expelled and driuen from thence by the Gauls, it was conteined within the&s;e bounds. Of tho&s;e eleuen prouinces into which all <HI>Italy</HI> was by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> diuided, as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth, this was the &s;euenth. The <HI>Origines,</HI> a booke which commonly goeth vnder <HI>Catoes</HI> name, do diuide this countrie into the <HI>Maritima,</HI> (that part which coa&s;teth along the &s;ea, and is of <HI>Vopi&s;cus</HI> in the &s;tory of <HI>Aurelia|nus</HI> &s;aid to be fertile and full of woods) the <HI>Tran&s;ciminia,</HI> beyond the mount <HI>Ciminus (Monte viterbo)</HI> and the <HI>Lartheniana,</HI> &s;o named of the city <HI>Larthenium. Iornandes</HI> and <HI>Ammianus</HI> in his 26. booke doth make mention of <HI>Anno|naria Etruria,</HI> about the towne <HI>Pi&s;torium (Pi&s;toia.)</HI> Moreouer, <HI>Lib. de Limitib.</HI> &s;peaketh of <HI>Etruria Vrbicaria.</HI> Was not this a|bout the city of <HI>Rome? Diony&s;ius Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> in his &s;ixth booke writeth that it was diuided into 12. Dukedomes: <HI>Liuy</HI> in his fir&s;t booke calleth them people (<HI>populos</HI> hundreds, tribes) at which it &s;eemeth <HI>Virgill</HI> did aime, where he thus writeth, <HI>Gens illi triplex populi &s;ubgente quaterni.</HI> Three Nations great <HI>Etruria</HI> do po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, foure tribes ech nation it contein'd. Out of the which chu&s;ing one king in common, ech people &s;ent their &s;euerall &s;ergeants, to attend vpon him. <HI>Seruius</HI> nameth them <HI>Lucumones,</HI> at the &s;econd booke of <HI>Virgils Georgickes,</HI> and would haue the word to &s;ignifie kings: yet <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> &s;aith that they are men &s;o called of their madne&s;&s;e, for that they make all places where they come vnluckie and vnfortunate. In the forenamed <HI>Origines,</HI> they are called twelue colonies; and are thus recited in order, <HI>Ianiculum, Arinianum</HI> vpon <HI>Tiber, Phe&s;ulae,</HI> and another <HI>Arinianum</HI> vpon <HI>Arnus, Phregenae, Volce Volaterra, Cariara</HI> otherwi&s;e named <HI>Luna</HI> vpon the &s;hore, <HI>Ogygianum, Aretium, Ro&s;ellae,</HI> and <HI>Vol|&s;inium</HI> within the land. <HI>Volaterranus</HI> reckoneth them vp by the&s;e names and in this order: <HI>Luna, Pi&s;ae, Populonia, Volaterra, A|gyllina, Fe&s;ulae, Ru&s;&s;ellana, Aretium, Peru&s;ia, Clu&s;ium, Faleria</HI> and <HI>Vul&s;inia.</HI> An ancient monument of &s;tone, yet remaining at <HI>Vul&s;inium (Bol&s;ena)</HI> as <HI>Onyphrius</HI> affirmeth, maketh mention of fifteen Hundreds of <HI>Etruria.</HI></P>
<P>The country hath been called by diuers names. For out of <HI>Pliny</HI> we learne that it was fir&s;t named VMBRIA: who withall af|firmeth that the <HI>Vmbri</HI> were throwen out of it by the <HI>Pela&s;gi,</HI> and thereupon it was called PELASGIA. The&s;e the <HI>Lydi</HI> did expell as the &s;ame <HI>Pliny</HI> with <HI>Trogus</HI> doth witne&s;&s;e, of who&s;e king <HI>Tyrrhenus</HI> it was intituled TYRRHENIA, as <HI>Paterculus, Halicarna&s;|&s;aeus, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Liuy</HI> haue left recorded. Soone after that, of the ceremony of &s;acrificing, it was called in the Greeke tongue TVSCIA. It was al&s;o named, as the &s;ame <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> writeth RASENA, of a certaine Duke or Generall of that nation: In <HI>Myr&s;ilus,</HI> if I be not deceiued, it is corruptly written <HI>Ra&s;enua.</HI> Moreouer it was called COMARA and SALEVMBRONE, if we will beleeue the feined <HI>Bero&s;us, Annius,</HI> and &s;uch like fabulous writers. The <HI>Phocen&s;es,</HI> as <HI>Herodotus</HI> in <HI>Clio</HI> writeth, &s;ometime po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. The fragment of <HI>Antonius</HI> neere the lake <HI>Arnus</HI> maketh mention of the Phocen&s;es, and the lake Phocen&s;is. <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> al&s;o in his fir&s;t booke &s;aith that the <HI>Siculi</HI> did inhabite it before the entrance of the <HI>Pela&s;gi.</HI></P>
<P>The nature of the &s;oile is very fertile of all maner of things, yea of vines e&s;pecially, as <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> hath giuen out. The large champion plaines, diuided into &s;euerall by-hils and mountaines, are well manured and very fruitfull, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> witne&s;|&s;eth. It is very woody, good pa&s;torage and well watered with many plea&s;ant &s;treames, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> iu&s;tifieth. <HI>Martianus</HI> &s;aith that for fertility of &s;oile it was euer renowmed and of great e&s;timation: which fertility is no &s;mall meanes to draw the people to giue them&s;elues ouermuch to plea&s;ure and ea&s;e: for they are, as the &s;ame <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> writeth, very fine in their apparell and dainty in their diet both at home and abroad: who indeed be&s;ide things nece&s;&s;arie, do carrie about with them, euen when they go to warre, diuers fine things mo&s;t curiou&s;lie wrought onlie for plea&s;ure and delight. <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> calleth it a robbing, cruell and vnciuill nation. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his 2. booke <HI>de praeparati. Euang.</HI> &s;aith that they were much giuen to Necromancie. <HI>Arnobius</HI> in his 7. booke <HI>contra Gentes,</HI> maketh it the mother and nurce of &s;uper&s;tition. They were alwaies counted very religious, and &s;o were the fir&s;t that found out &s;acrifices, diuinations, and &s;ooth&s;ayings, from whom al&s;o the Romanes receiued the&s;e vaine and &s;uper|&s;titious arts: as al&s;o the <HI>Sella curulis</HI> (coach of e&s;tate) <HI>paludamenta, trabea,</HI> (the rich robe) <HI>toga pretexta, toga picta, fa&s;ces, &s;ecures,</HI> (hatchets) <HI>litui, apparitores, curcules, annuli, annuli,</HI> (rings) mu&s;ick, &amp; the <HI>ludiones</HI> (whifflers.) La&s;tly, all their orname~ts of triumph &amp; robes of the Con&s;uls, or rather, (that I may v&s;e the words of <HI>Florus</HI>) all the brauery &amp; badges wherewith the honorable e&s;tate of the Empire was graced &amp; &s;et out. <HI>Ca&s;siodore</HI> in the 15. &s;ection of his 7. book doth attribute to them the inuentio~ of the ca&s;ting and working of &s;tatues of bra&s;&s;e. Heere hence it aro&s;e that the Romans fir&s;t committed their children to the <HI>Etru&s;ci,</HI> to be taught &amp; brought vp, as afterward they v&s;ed to do to the Grecians, as you may read in <HI>Liuy, Strabo</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus.</HI> That the flute <HI>(tibia)</HI> was the inuention of the <HI>Tyrrheni,</HI> by which they did not only fight, but al&s;o whip their &s;eruants, yea and to &s;eeth, <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> doth cite out of <HI>Ari&s;totle.</HI> Of them <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the 8. booke of his <HI>Conuiual.</HI> writeth, that by an ancient &s;tatute they v|&s;ed to di&s;per&s;e their couerleds and blanckets when they ro&s;e out of their beds in the morning. <HI>Item,</HI> taking of their pots off the fire, they left no print thereof in the a&s;hes, but did alwaies rake them abroad. They neuer would &s;uffer any &s;wallowes to come within their hou&s;e. They might not go ouer a broome. They would keep none in their hou&s;e that had crooked nailes vpon his fingers. Yet <HI>Thimon,</HI> in the 12. booke of <HI>Athenaeus,</HI> his <HI>deipno&s;ophi&s;ton,</HI> calleth them voluptuous and licentious liuers, and none of the be&s;t report for their conuer&s;ation: heereof you may &s;ee manie examples if you take anie delight in &s;uch &s;tories. The like you may read in his 4 booke. But I cannot omit this one thing which <HI>Heraclides</HI> in his Politicks doth recite: namely, that if anie man be &s;o farre in debt that he is not able to paie, the boies do follow him holding vp vnto him, in mockery, an emptie pur&s;e. The <HI>Etru&s;ci</HI> were long &s;ince accounted verie wealthie. They were very &s;trong both by &s;ea and by land: and in warre e|quall in &s;trength to the Romanes. <HI>Liuy</HI> (to whom <HI>Diodorus</HI> doth &s;ub&s;cribe) &s;aith it is the riche&s;t prouince of <HI>Italy</HI> both for men, munition and money. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the life of <HI>Camillus,</HI> &s;aith, that this countrie did reach from the Alpes Northward as high as the Hadriaticke &s;ea, and Southward as low as the midland &s;ea. That there were 300. cities of the <HI>Vmbri,</HI> battered and taken by the <HI>Tu&s;ci,</HI> we find recorded, &s;aith <HI>Pliny.</HI> Such was the wealth and command of <HI>Etruria,</HI> that it did not onlie filll the land with an honourable report and fame of their name, but al&s;o euen the &s;ea all along from one end of <HI>Italy</HI> to the other. <HI>Liuy</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> do affirme that <HI>Mantua</HI> and <HI>Atri</HI> were colonies of the <HI>Tu&s;ci; Pomponius</HI> and <HI>Paterculus</HI> do &s;ay the like of <HI>Capua:</HI> as al&s;o of <HI>Nola,</HI> although that <HI>Solinus</HI> doth a&s;cribe this to the Tyrians (where I thinke the copie is corrupt, and for <HI>Tyrijs,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be written <HI>Tyrrhenis) Trogus</HI> and <HI>Silius Ital cus</HI> do affirme it to haue been built and fir&s;t peopled by the <HI>Chaldicen&s;es.</HI> Yea <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his treati&s;e of famous women, and againe in his Gretian que&s;tions, &s;aith, that the&s;e <HI>Etru&s;ci,</HI> in old time did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e <HI>Lemnos, (Stalamine)</HI> and <HI>Imbrus (Lembro)</HI> certaine ilands in the <HI>Archipelago</HI> or Aegean &s;ea.</P>
<P><HI>Tu&s;cus vicus,</HI> a &s;treet in <HI>Rome: Tu&s;culum</HI> and <HI>Tu&s;culanum,</HI> in <HI>Latium (Campagna di Roma)</HI> tooke their names from hence; Againe <HI>mare Tu&s;cum,</HI> called otherwi&s;e <HI>mare Inferum, Notium, Tyrrhenum,</HI> and <HI>Liburnum,</HI> (the Neather &s;ea, or South &s;ea, in re&s;pect of the Hadriaticke &s;ea which is called <HI>mare Superum,</HI> the vpper &s;ea, and is vpon the North from this countrie) as we find in <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Cicero.</HI> About <HI>Puteoli (Pozzole)</HI> as <HI>Dion</HI> recordeth, there is a creeke of the &s;ea called <HI>Tyrrhenus &s;inus,</HI> the bay of <HI>Tu&s;cane.</HI> But there are al&s;o other <HI>Tu&s;ci,</HI> diuer&s;e from the&s;e in <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> as <HI>Ptolemey</HI> noteth: as al&s;o other Tyrrheni, in the ilands belonging to <HI>Attica,</HI> if you will beleeue <HI>Mar&s;ylus Lesbius.</HI></P>

<HEAD>LATIVM.</HEAD>
<P>_LATIVM, which the excellent Poet Virgil &s;yrnameth The Great, The Faire, and The We&s;tern, by the de&s;cription of Augu&s;tus, who, as Pliny te&s;tifieth, diuided Italy in eleuen &s;hires, the chiefe and principall of the re&s;t, was twofold, to wit, Latium The New, and Latium The Old. LATIVM VETVS, <HI>Olde Latium,</HI> beganne at the riuer Tiber, and extended it &s;elfe euen vp as high as the Circaeian mountaines (or to Fundi, as Seruius &s;ayth.) LATIVM NOVVM, <HI>New Latium,</HI> from hence &s;tretched it &s;elfe vnto the riuer Liris, as Pliny and Strabo do ioyntly te&s;tifie: yea and farther, as they both affirme: For euen as low as Sinue&s;&s;a, (which was otherwi&s;e al&s;o called Sinope) being in that part which is named <HI>Adiectum Latium,</HI> the &s;ame Pliny calleth Latium beyond the Liris, which is indeed a part of Campania. Which peraduenture was the rea|&s;on that moued Seruius to extend this Latium as farre that way as the riuer Vulturnus. So that the bounds of this Latium are the Tyrrhen &s;ea, the mount Apenninus, the riuers Tiber, Anio, and Liris. The neighbour Nations inhabiting round about it are the <HI>Tu&s;ci, Sabini, Mar&s;i, Samnites, Praegutiani,</HI> and the <HI>Campani.</HI> It was &s;o named of the Verbe <HI>Lateo,</HI> &s;ignifying To lurke or Lie hid; for that Saturnus here did hide him&s;elfe, as Seruius writeth: and in trueth before him Herodianus, Eutropius, Cyprianus, and Minutius Felix do plainly affirme the &s;ame; yea and that Poet, which in all mens opinions is counted the be&s;t, in the&s;e his ver&s;es. <HI>Primus ab aetherio venit Saturnus Olympo, Arma Iouis fugiens, &amp; regnis exul ademptis. Is ge|nus in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">oc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">, ac d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;per&s;um montibus altis, Compo&s;uit, leg&egrave;&s;que dedit, Latium&abque; vocari Maluit, his quoniam latui&s;&s;et tutus in oris.</HI> Thus Engli&s;hed by M. T. Pha&euml;r: Fir&s;t from Olympus mount (right neere the skies) good Saturne old, When he from Ioue did flie, &amp; from his kingdome outlaw'd &s;tood, He fir&s;t that wayward skitti&s;h kinde di&s;per&s;t in hilles and wood, Did bring to thrift, and gaue them lawes, and all the land this way Did Latium call, for &s;afely here long time he lurking lay. The &s;ame, another Poet, as famous as he, both for his eloquence and long exile, relating the words of god Ianus, thus reporteth: <HI>Multa quidem didici, &s;ed cur naualis in aere Actera &s;ignata e&s;t, altera forma biceps? No&s;cere me duplici me po&s;&s;is in imagine, dixit: Nivetus ip&s;a dies extenua&s;&s;et opus. Cau&s;&s;a ratis &s;upere&s;t: Tu&s;cum venit ra|te in amuem, Ante pererrato falcifer orbe deus. Hac ego Saturnum memini tellure receptum, Caelitibus regnis &agrave; Ioue pul&s;us erat. Inde diu genti man&s;it Saturnia nomen: Dicta quo&abque; e&s;t Latium terra latente Deo. At bona po&s;teritas puppim formauit in aere, He&s;pitis aduentum te&s;tificata Dei.</HI> Prudentius al&s;o, the Chri&s;tian Poet, in his booke which he wrote again&s;t Symmachus, thus writeth of Saturnus: <HI>Num melius Saturnus auos rexi&s;&s;e Latinos Creditur? edictis qui talibus informauit Agre&s;tes animos &amp; barbara cor|da virorum? Sum D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">us, aduenio fugiens, praebete latebras. Occultate &s;enem, nati feritate tyranni Deiectum &s;olio: placet hic fugitiuus &amp; exul, Vt lateam, genti atque loco Latium dabo nomen.</HI> Is't thought that Saturne did the Latines better rule, Who taught them fir&s;t when as they were as wilde as hor&s;e or mule? A god I am indeed, &s;hew where I may me hide; For I haue lo&s;t my regall crowne, by Ioues vntimely pride; And &s;till I feare his power, I dare him not abide. If that you'll grant me leaue with you to hide my head, Latium this countrey &s;halbe call'd long after I am dead. So that Solinus Polyhi&s;tor did not without iu&s;t cau&s;e make this demand: <HI>Who is he that knoweth not, that of Saturnus this countrey was named both Latium and Saturnia?</HI> But if any man &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e reports to be fabulous and mere Po&euml;ticall fictions, let him heare the learned Varro &s;peake, an authour farre more ancient than all tho&s;e aforenamed, who affirmeth it to haue been &s;o named, <HI>qu&ograve;d lateat inter Alpium &amp; Apennini praecipitia,</HI> for that it is hid, enclo&s;ed or conteined betweene the &s;teepe and craggie cliffes of the Alpes and A|penninus. But what &s;hire, I pray you, in all Olde Italy is there, <HI>quae non aequ&egrave; latet?</HI> that is not thus inuironed? If I poore goo&s;e might dare to keake among&s;t the&s;e well tun'd &s;wannes, I &s;hould rather thinke it to haue gotten this name, not <HI>&agrave; latendo,</HI> of lurking, but <HI>&agrave; latitudine,</HI> of the bredth of it: For there is no other countrey of the right and ancient Italie, that betweene the &s;ea and tho&s;e mountaines doth &s;pread it &s;elfe more broad and wide euery way than this doth: and that the Geographicall charts and mappes of this prouince doe &s;ufficiently approoue. But let antiquity be &s;till beleeued, I poore foole will not impeach their credit, le&s;t at la&s;t it turne to mine owne di&s;credit. There are &s;ome, as Hieronymus Columna, writing vpon the fragments of the famous Poet Ennius, reporteth, which thinke that this name <HI>Saturnus</HI> is a meere Syrian word, and in that language to &s;ignifie the &s;ame that <HI>latens</HI> (that is, one that playeth lea&s;t in &s;ight) doth in Latine: And hereupon tho&s;e ancients, as it were, interpreting the word, haue called that &s;hire and countrey where the Latines dwelt, LA|TIVM Trueth it is, and all learned in the&s;e orientall tongues can beare me witne&s;&s;e, that the Hebrew thema <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Sathar,</HI> &s;ignifieth to lurke, or hide ones &s;elfe from the pre&s;ence or &s;ight of others: which &s;ignification it con&s;tantly reteineth both in the Syrian or Chaldey, and Arabicke dialects. From hence al&s;o may analogically be formed <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Sithron,</HI> (from which by adding <HI>us,</HI> the Latine termination, is made <HI>Saturnus</HI>) like as of <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Pathar,</HI> to interpret, is made <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Pithron,</HI> an interpretation, and of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Rahama,</HI> to be mercifull or pitifull, is made <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Rahman,</HI> in the Arabian, or <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Rahmana</HI> in the Syrian tongue, a pitifull hearted man: and of <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Thirgem,</HI> to interpret out of one language into another, is framed al&s;o <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Thurgmana,</HI> an interpretour; v&s;ed likewi&s;e by the Chaldey Paraphra&s;t at the &s;euenth P&s;alme: as al&s;o by the Arabian interpretour of the New Te&s;tament, at the 28. ver&s;e of the 14. chapter of the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle of S.

That the inhabitants or people of this countrey were called <HI>Latini,</HI> Strabo with all the an|cient writers of the Romane hi&s;tories doth plainly teach vs, denominated of <HI>Latinus</HI> a king of this prouince, according to that of Virgil &mdash; <HI>genus vnde Latinum,</HI> From whom the Latines tooke their name. Pliny al&s;o maketh mention of the <HI>Latinien&s;es,</HI> a nation of this prouince; but extinct &s;omething before his time, as he there addeth. The&s;e were called <HI>Pri&s;ci,</HI> as Halicarna&s;&s;eus and Fe&s;tus doe te&s;tifie. Of the nature of this countrey Strabo in the fifth booke of his Geo|graphy writeth thus: All Latium, &s;ayth he, generally is a very good &s;oile and fertile of all maner of things, except only &s;ome certeine places neere the &s;ea coa&s;t, which are mori&s;h and very vnhealthfull; as namely the fields about Ardea, and what&s;oeuer is betweene Lauinium and Antium, euen as farre as Po|metia, with &s;ome places about Setia; and others neere Tarracina and Circeium; be&s;ide all tho&s;e fields that are &s;tony and mountainous; although euen the&s;e grounds are not altogether idle and vnfruitfull: all of them hauing either &s;ome good pa&s;tures and large woods, or doe yeeld great abundance of fenny and mountainous commodities. Caecubum, a place in this fenne, doth yeeld a kinde of vine which groweth vp in height like a tree, who&s;e wine is counted to be the be&s;t of all Italy. Heare al&s;o what Theophra&s;tus writeth of this prouince in the fift booke of his hi&s;tory of Plants, at the ninth chapter of the &s;ame booke: <HI>Latinus ager,</HI> the countrey of Latium, &s;ayth he, hath great plenty of water. The champion plaines haue great &s;tore of laurell and myrtle trees: item they yeeld a wonderfull kinde of beech (<HI>&s;ci&s;&s;ima,</HI> he calleth it, or <HI>oxea,</HI> as others terme it) of that maruellous length, that one tree may &s;erue for a whole keele for &s;uch kinde of &s;hips as they commonly v&s;e in Etruria. The hilly and mountainous places doe beare the pine and firre trees. Pliny doth highly commend the wines of Latium, <HI>(Latinien&s;ia vina.)</HI> The &s;ame authour affirmeth that their chiefe meat was <HI>far,</HI> that is, a kinde of bearded or redde wheat; and withall, te&s;tifieth that it is certaine that the Romans for a long time together liued with <HI>puls,</HI> by which they vnder&s;tand all maner of corne be&s;ide wheat and barley, not with bread. How populous this countrey was, how many cities and people it conteined, the &s;ame authour doth teach vs, where he writeth that in Old <HI>Latium</HI> only three and fiftie nations are vtterly decayed and extinct without any mention at all remaining of their names. Item, that <HI>Pomptina palus,</HI> the fen Pontina (now called <HI>Aufente palude</HI>) a part al&s;o of this countrey, had in former times in it three and twentie cities. Of all the cities of Latium, in olde time Alba longa was the chiefe and metropolitan: but afterward Rome, which grew to that greatne&s;&s;e and power that it was not only the head of this prouince, but al&s;o euen of the whole world be&s;ide. Who&s;e other name, becau&s;e it is held an vnlawfull thing to &s;peake that which is concealed and enrowled in cere|monious my&s;teries, I will not vtter, le&s;t with Valerius Soranus, I be worthily puni&s;hed for the &s;ame. Yet the &s;yrnames, epithets, and commendable titles where with it was graced and &s;et out by the be&s;t writers of all nations, if I &s;hall here reckon vp, I hope there is no man, that is an indifferent Iudge, that will blame me.

<HEAD>CIRCAEIVS MONS, Now MONTE CIRCELLO.</HEAD>
<P>_PLiny and Pomponius Mela call this mountaine CIRCEIVM MONTEM: Strabo and Ptolemey CIRCAEVM. but an ancient in&s;cri|ption in this &s;ame place calleth it CIRCAEVM, denominated as ancient writers affirme of <HI>Circes,</HI> the famous &s;orcere&s;&s;e, who &s;ometime dwelt here, as they verily beleeued. Whereupon Mela and Solinus, as al&s;o Ouid him&s;elfe, nameth it <HI>Circes domum,</HI> Circes hou&s;e. Item Ap|pollonius in like maner calleth it Circes habitacle, &amp; Ae AE AE <HI>portum,</HI> (with three diphthongs, as Seruius ob&s;erueth in Virgil) the Aeaean hauen. It was &s;o called, as the &s;ame Grammarian writeth, of a contemptuous word v&s;ed by tho&s;e which pa&s;&s;ed by that way, which they vttered in contempt of tho&s;e her witchcrafts &amp; &s;orceries, whereby &s;he turned men into &s;wine, practi&s;ed in this place. This was long &s;ince an iland, and inuironed round with the ocean &s;ea, but now by continuance of time it is ioyned to the continent, as Solinus te&s;tifieth. The like doth Pliny affirme of it; It was, &s;ayth he, &s;ometime inclo&s;ed round with the maine &s;ea, as Homer &s;eemeth to thinke, but now it &s;tandeth vpon the firme land. But was not Homer deceiued? &s;urely &s;o Procopius, in the fir&s;t booke of his <HI>Gothica,</HI> &s;eemeth to thinke. Of the mountaine <HI>Circeius,</HI> &s;ayth he, where they report Vly&s;&s;es had conference with the enchantre&s;&s;e <HI>Circe,</HI> as I thinke, they &s;peake many things that are not true: except that peraduenture one might &s;ay that this mountaine was therefore an iland, for that it &s;hooteth out an huge way into the va&s;t ocean &amp;c. And although that Homer heere hath Theophra|&s;tus, in his hi&s;tory of Plants, and Seruius in his Commentaries vpon Virgils Aeneides, vpon his &s;ide, as Patrons of fabulous antiquity, yet that I &s;hould rather leane vnto Procopius, the opinion of the learned M. I&s;aac Ca&s;aubon, who in tho&s;e his laborious Commentaries vpon the Geography of Strabo hath ob&s;er|ued, that oft times among&s;t the be&s;t Geographers, Ilands and Promontories are confounded, and one put for another: &s;o that that which one authour termeth a promontory, another calleth by the name of an ile or a neckland. Therefore I do willingly preferre the de&s;cription of Strabo of this place, before tho&s;e de&s;criptions of any other authours what&s;oeuer, as more true and probable. From Antium, &s;ayth he, two hundred foure &s;core and ten furlongs, is &s;itu|ate mount Circello <HI>[Circaeum]</HI> an hill inuironed partly with the &s;ea and partly with moori&s;h fennes and bogges. Tho&s;e things al&s;o which the Poets do tell of the witchcraft of the &s;orcere&s;&s;e Circe, and that fabulous tran&s;mutation and changing of men into diuers and &s;undry formes or &s;hapes, with Seruius I doe ra|ther attribute to the force of nature, than to magicke or witchcraft. namely, of the horrour of tho&s;e which pa&s;&s;e by that way, whereby men do &s;eeme to be changed into bea&s;ts. and with Pliny I may &s;ay, How infinite are tho&s;e fables that are tolde of Medea of Colchis, and others, but e&s;pecially of our Italian Circe, who for her excellent skill in the arte magicke was canonized for a godde&s;&s;e? And be it farre from me, and from euery Chri&s;tian man, that we &s;hould beleeue tho&s;e things which it were wicked and profane to thinke or imagine. For I haue read in the Ancyrane councell, that they are woor&s;e than Pagans and infidels, who doe beleeue that any creature may by any man be turned and transformed into any other &s;hape or &s;imilitude, than by the Creatour him|&s;elfe, who fir&s;t gaue them that forme and fa&s;hion. Therefore let all other men &s;ay what they will, and per&s;wade what they can, they &s;hall neuer make me be|leeue the&s;e fables. It &s;eemeth that the fable aro&s;e of the nature and quality of the place. for tho&s;e places which lie out into the &s;ea, as this promontory doth, are woont to be in more danger of &s;torme and windes than any other places what&s;oeuer. Which bla&s;ts, accompanied with the waues, ebbes and tides of the &s;ourging &s;ea, falling vpon the rocks, cliffes and hollow places, do cau&s;e &s;uch &s;undry &s;ounds and noices, that &s;uch as doe &s;aile by this way, not without a great horrour and trembling, doe &s;eeme as if they heard at one in&s;tant men mourne, lions roare, wolues howle, dogs barke, hogs grunt, and beares to make a noice. Hither do tho&s;e words of Lucan in his &s;ixt booke belong; <HI>Omnia &s;ubducit Circaeae vela procellae.</HI> That this promontory is full of trees, e&s;pecially of okes, myrtles, and bay-trees, Theophra&s;tus writeth from the relation of others. Strabo &s;ayth that it aboundeth with diuers &s;orts of roots: peraduenture, as there he addeth, they affirme this of it, that they may the better apply it in all re&s;pects vnto the fable of Circe. And do you not thinke that this &s;aying of Ari&s;totle the Prince of Philo&s;ophers, in his <HI>Admiranda,</HI> did ari&s;e from hence? They report, &s;ayth he, that in the mount Circello there groweth a deadly poi&s;on, of &s;uch great force, that &s;o &s;oone as euer it is taken, all the haire of the body immediatly falleth off, and it &s;o weakeneth all the parts and members of the &s;ame, that they wex &s;o litly and dwined, that outwardly they beare the &s;hew of dead carkei&s;es, &s;uch as it would grieue any man to beholde. Strabo writeth that in this mountaine was an altar dedicated to Minerua. and withall there is to this day to be &s;eene a certeine goblet or bowle of Vly&s;&s;es. but this latter he affir|meth to be from the opinion and report of the vulgar &s;ort only. But pa&s;&s;ing ouer the&s;e fables, let vs returne againe vnto the hi&s;toricall narration of &s;uch things as in trueth are either here found or haue happened in this place. Horace hath left recorded, that the &s;ea vpon this coa&s;t yeeldeth great &s;tore of good oi&s;ters, which thereof are called <HI>O&s;trea Circaeia.</HI> Suetonius reporteth that Marcus Lepidus was by Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar for euer confined and bani&s;hed into this place. Plutarch writeth that Iulius Cae&s;ar had a purpo&s;e, hard beneath the city, by a deepe channell to conuey the riuer Tiber another way, and to turne the cour&s;e thereof toward this <HI>Circaeium promontorium,</HI> and &s;o to haue cau&s;ed it to fall into the &s;ea, at the city Anxur: by which meanes tho&s;e which for trade and trafficke were by &s;hip to trauell vp to Rome, he meant to make their pa&s;&s;age more ea&s;ie and &s;afe; but being preuented by death, performed not what he had purpo&s;ed. Here al&s;o was the city CIRCAEIVM or <HI>Circaeia,</HI> or as Strabo termeth it <HI>Circes towne.</HI> That it was made a colony of the Romans by Tarqui|nius, Liuy, Halicarna&s;&s;eus, Cicero and Plutarch, do ioyntly te&s;tifie. Strabo &s;ayth that it hath a good and conuenient hauen. I would thinke that the menti|on or plot of this ancient citie <HI>Circaeia</HI> doth &s;till remaine in this mountaine in that place where in this de&s;cription thou &s;ee&s;t certeine ruines and foundations of the walles, as it were of a city ra&s;ed long &s;ince and layd leuell almo&s;t with the ground: which place at this day is called by the name of <HI>Citta vecchia,</HI> that is as much to &s;ay, as, The old citie. Certeine remnants of this name doth yet remaine to be &s;eene engrauen in the top of this &s;ame mountaine, as Angelus Bre|uentanus, a man of good credit, the authour of this de&s;cription, and a mo&s;t diligent &s;earcher out of the Romane antiquities, doth from his owne know|ledge plainly te&s;tifie, yet much defaced, as he al&s;o affirmeth, and worne out with continuance of time, to wit, in this forme;

<HEAD>MAGNA GRAECIA, OR GREAT GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>_THat a great part of the true and ancient <HI>Italy</HI> (if not all of it) together with all <HI>Sicily</HI> was &s;ometime called by the name of GREAT GREECE, I thinke there is no man meanly &s;een in Geographie that maketh any doubt: for the <HI>Grecians</HI> did in former times po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, as <HI>Trogus</HI> writeth, not only a part, but welnigh all <HI>Italy.</HI> Li&s;ten what <HI>Pliny,</HI> in the fifth chapter of his third booke, &s;aith, Of it the Gre|cians, a Nation very prodigall in commending them&s;elues, haue giuen their verdict, in that they haue named a great part of it <HI>Great Greece.</HI> Hither al&s;o pertaine tho&s;e wordes of <HI>Fe&s;tus. Italy</HI> was cal|led <HI>Great Greece,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Siculi,</HI> &s;ometime pa&s;&s;ed it, or for that many and the greate&s;t cities of it, were built by the Grecians. <HI>Seruius</HI> in his Commentaries vpon the fir&s;t of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneids, writeth thus: <HI>Italy</HI> was termed <HI>Megale Hellas,</HI> Great <HI>Greece,</HI> for that all the cities from <HI>Taranto, (Tarentum)</HI> euen vnto <HI>Cumae,</HI> were fir&s;t founded by the Grecians. And therefore it was not altogether vnfitly of <HI>Plautus</HI> in his <HI>Menechmis,</HI> called <HI>Graecia exotica,</HI> outlandi&s;h <HI>Greece. Seneca,</HI> in his Con&s;olation, thus &s;peaketh of it: All that &s;ide of <HI>Italy,</HI> which coa&s;teth along with the Neather &s;ea <HI>(Mar To&s;co)</HI> was called <HI>Great Greece.</HI> That <HI>Campania (Terra di lauoro)</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Grecians, <HI>Pliny</HI> doth plainly affirme. <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> in his &s;ix and twentieth Oration de&s;cribeth <HI>Auernus lacus,</HI> the lake of <HI>Tipergola,</HI> in <HI>Campania,</HI> to be within the compa&s;&s;e of <HI>Great Greece.</HI> And that the&s;e authours &s;peake truth, <HI>Trogus</HI> par|ticularly &s;heweth in the twentith booke of his hi&s;tory, in the&s;e wordes: The <HI>Tu&s;ci</HI> which dwell along by the coa&s;t of the Neather &s;ea, came from <HI>Lydia: Item,</HI> the Venetians <HI>(Veneti)</HI> which now we &s;ee to be &s;eated neere the vpper-&s;ea, <HI>(Golfo di Venetia,</HI> the Hadriaticke &s;ea) <HI>Troy,</HI> when it was taken and &s;acked, &s;ent thither vnder the conduct of <HI>Antenor:</HI> moreouer, the city <HI>Adria (Atri)</HI> which fir&s;t gaue name to the Adriaticke &s;ea, neere neighbour vnto the Illirian &s;ea, is a city built by the Greekes: <HI>Diomedes,</HI> after the ouerthrow of <HI>Troy,</HI> built the city <HI>Arpi, (Sarpi,</HI> or <HI>Monte S. Angelo</HI> a city in <HI>Apulia)</HI> being him&s;elfe and his company caried thither by violence of &s;torme and tempe&s;t. And <HI>Pi&s;ae in Liguria, (Pi&s;a in Riuiera di Genoa)</HI> was fir&s;t begun by the Grecians: as al&s;o in <HI>Tu&s;cane</HI> the <HI>Tarquinij, (Tarquene)</HI> came from the The&s;&s;alians and Spinambrians: and the <HI>Peru&s;ini (Perugia)</HI> from the Achaians: what &s;hall I &s;ay of the city <HI>Caere (Ceruetere?)</HI> what of the <HI>Latini?</HI> which do &s;eeme to haue had their beginning from <HI>Aeneas:</HI> now the <HI>Fali&s;ci, Nolani, Abelani,</HI> are they not generally held for to be no other but colonies deriued from the <HI>Chalci|den&s;es</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the Le&s;&s;e? what &s;hall I &s;peake of the whole &s;hire of <HI>Campania?</HI> of the <HI>Brutij</HI> and <HI>Sabini?</HI> of the <HI>Samnites</HI> and <HI>Ta|rentini?</HI> haue we not heard oft that they came from <HI>Lacedaemonia,</HI> and were commonly called <HI>Spurij?</HI> They report that <HI>Philo|ctetes</HI> built the city of the <HI>Thurini, (Terra noua)</HI> where to this day his tombe is to be &s;eene: as al&s;o the arrowes of <HI>Hercules,</HI> which were the bane of <HI>Troy.</HI> The <HI>Metapontini, (Torre di mare)</HI> al&s;o do &s;till re&s;erue, in the temple of <HI>Minerua,</HI> the tooles wherewith <HI>Epeus</HI> (from whom they are de&s;cended) made the Troiane hor&s;e, whereby the city was betraied. Whereupon all that part of <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> was called GREAT GREECE. Thus farre <HI>Iu&s;tine</HI> out of <HI>Trogus Pompeius.</HI> Whereby we gather, that the plea&s;ant poet <HI>Ouid</HI> in the fourth booke of his <HI>Fa&s;torum,</HI> did &s;peake but the truth, when he &s;aid: <HI>Itala nam tellus Graecia Maior erat:</HI> For <HI>Grecia</HI> Great, that land was called, which now <HI>Italia</HI> hight: and &s;o foorth, as followeth in the &s;ame place. The &s;ame almo&s;t that you haue heard out of <HI>Trogus.</HI> Of this &s;ame Great <HI>Greece</HI> I cannot but adde that which I haue ob&s;erued contrary to the opinion which &s;ome ve|ry learned men in our time, haue written of it: namely, that euen as <HI>Sicilia,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his &s;ixth booke te&s;tifieth, was compre|hended vnder the name of <HI>Great Greece;</HI> &s;o contrariwi&s;e al&s;o this <HI>Great Greece,</HI> was now and then vnder&s;tood by the name of <HI>Si|cilia:</HI> for proofe heereof con&s;ider the&s;e authorities: Saint <HI>Hierome</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>Rhegium Iulium Brutiorum, (Reggio</HI> in <HI>Calabria</HI> the Lower) is a city of <HI>Sicilia: Aelianus</HI> and <HI>Suidas</HI> affirme the &s;ame of <HI>Tarentum</HI> in <HI>Calabria:</HI> the &s;ixth Coun&s;ell of <HI>Con&s;tantino ple,</HI> held in the time of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, doth the like of <HI>Baiae</HI> in <HI>Campania: Stephanus</HI> de&s;cribeth <HI>Sinue&s;&s;a,</HI> a towne of <HI>Campania; Caulonia, (Ca&s;tro veto)</HI> of the <HI>Locri, Lagaria,</HI> of the <HI>Thurini;</HI> and <HI>Mataurus,</HI> of the <HI>Brutij;</HI> by the name of places of <HI>Sicilia:</HI> the like doth <HI>Eu&s;tathius,</HI> by <HI>Crathis (Gratti)</HI> a riuer in <HI>Calabria:</HI> the Scholia&s;t of <HI>Theocritus,</HI> by <HI>Neaethus,</HI> a riuer of the <HI>Crotoniatae,</HI> a people of <HI>Vmbria. Item, Liuy</HI> an Italian borne, a man of &s;ingular iudgement, and more ancient than tho&s;e, hath <HI>Siculas vrbes in Campania,</HI> cities of <HI>Sicilia</HI> in <HI>Campania.</HI> Yea <HI>Pliny</HI> hath left recorded, that <HI>Togata Gallia,</HI> the furthe&s;t prouince of <HI>Italy</HI> toward the VVe&s;t, before &s;uch time as the Gauls came thither, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Siculi. Thucydides</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Siculi</HI> being expelled by the <HI>Opici,</HI> a people of <HI>Campania,</HI> &s;eized vpon this iland. And if we will not giue credit vnto <HI>Seruius,</HI> yet again&s;t <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus</HI> a writer of good credit, we cannot except, who hath written the very &s;elfe &s;ame thing: namely, that the <HI>Siculi,</HI> a people borne and bred in <HI>Italy,</HI> and did fir&s;t of all nations what&s;oeuer inhabite and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the Romane &s;oile. La&s;tly, that this prouince, called <HI>Great Greece,</HI> was inhabited of the <HI>Siculi, Strabo</HI> in the fith booke of his Geography doth te&s;tifie out of <HI>Antiochus.</HI> Thus farre of that ancient <HI>Great Greece,</HI> or, if you plea&s;e &s;o to call it, of <HI>Sicilia:</HI> all which we haue not de&s;cribed in this Mappe, but only the outter part of it; in which, be&s;ide <HI>Calabria, Apulia,</HI> the <HI>Brutij</HI> and <HI>Locri:</HI> there is <HI>Great Greece,</HI> properly &s;o called by <HI>Ptolemey, Liuy, Polybius, Athenaeus</HI> and <HI>Valerius Maximus:</HI> and that, as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his &s;ixth booke, and <HI>Cicero</HI> in his 2 booke of his Oratour, thinke becau&s;e <HI>Pythagoras the Grecian Philo&s;opher</HI> dwelt &s;ometime in the&s;e quarters; or, as <HI>Syne&s;ius</HI> in his oration <HI>de Dono</HI> wri|teth, for that it alwaies maintained and brought foorth <HI>&s;chollerlike and militarie men.</HI> Yet I rather relie vpon the iudgement of <HI>Atheneus,</HI> who writeth that it was &s;o called of the <HI>infinite number of Grecians</HI> which v&s;ually dwelt in this prouince. And that <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Trogus</HI> are of this opinion, I haue partly &s;hewed before. The&s;e forenamed countries of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;aeus,</HI> are compre|hended vnder the name of EAST ITALY. <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth them, <HI>The front of Italy:</HI> which, as <HI>Mela</HI> &s;aith, is diuided into <HI>two hornes,</HI> called in the fragments of <HI>Salu&s;t, two promontories,</HI> ne&s;&s;es, capes, or forelands, namely, <HI>Brutium, (Capo di Sparto vento,</HI> or, <HI>Capo de Larme)</HI> and <HI>Salentinum</HI> (now of &s;ome called <HI>Capo de S. Maria:</HI> of others, <HI>S. Maria de fin terre:</HI> and <HI>Capo de Leuca; item Stalat.</HI>) In the &s;econd booke of <HI>Straboes Epitome,</HI> they are termed <HI>coryphae,</HI> toppes: and are named <HI>Leucopetra,</HI> and <HI>Iapygium:</HI> (for the&s;e are &s;ynonymes with <HI>Bruttium</HI> and <HI>Salentinum.</HI>) But <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> calleth them <HI>Hornes:</HI> this <HI>The left horne,</HI> that, <HI>The right.</HI> For <HI>Salentinum,</HI> we read <HI>Lacinium,</HI> in <HI>Pliny:</HI> but whether it be a fault of the writers, or an errour of the authour, let the learned iudge, I determine nothing. The &s;ame <HI>Pliny</HI> compareth this tract to the forme of the <HI>Amazonian &s;hield,</HI> that is, to the <HI>halfe moone,</HI> as <HI>Seruius</HI> expoundeth it, at that ver&s;e of the fir&s;t booke of <HI>Virgils</HI> Aeneides, <HI>Ducit, Amazonidum lunatis agmina peltis.</HI> There is in the&s;e quarters, the <HI>wood Sila (La Sila)</HI> of which <HI>Salu&s;t, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Vibius</HI> haue made mention. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that it is &s;euen hun|dred furlongs in length: full of goodly tall trees and well &s;tored with good water. <HI>Ca&s;siodorus</HI> in the twelfth booke of his <HI>Varia|rum,</HI> vnto <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ius,</HI> doth highly commend the <HI>chee&s;e</HI> made heere about.

<HEAD>SICILIA, OR TRINACRIA.</HEAD>
<P>_THat this was &s;ometime a <HI>penin&s;ula,</HI> or demy-ile, adioined to <HI>Italy,</HI> as a part of <HI>Brutium</HI> in <HI>Calabria</HI> neere to <HI>Rhegium (Rhezzo)</HI> and afterward was by violence of tempe&s;t &s;euered from the &s;ame (and of that accident the city <HI>Rhegium</HI> tooke the name) it is a generall opinion of all antiquity. But when, or at what certaine time, this diui&s;ion happened, there is not any memoriall, for ought I know, remaining in any ancient writer. <HI>Strabo, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> do write that it was cau&s;ed by an earthquake: <HI>Silius</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;siodorus,</HI> do thinke it to haue been done by the rage and violence of the tide and &s;urges of the &s;ea. They which lend their li&s;tening eares to fables, do attribute the cau&s;e of it to <HI>Neptune</HI> (as <HI>Eu&s;tathi|us</HI> witne&s;&s;eth) who, with his three-tined mace, in fauour of <HI>Ioca&s;tus,</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Aeolus,</HI> diuided it from the maine land, and &s;o made it an iland, which before was but a demy-ile; that by that meanes he might the more &s;afely inhabite and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the &s;ame. <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> moued by the authority of <HI>He&s;iodus,</HI> a&s;cribeth to <HI>Orion:</HI> who, that he might be compared to <HI>Hercules,</HI> cutting through the rockes and mountaines, fir&s;t ope|ned the Sicilian &s;treights, as he did of <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Therefore <HI>Trinacria quondam Italae pars vna fuit; &s;ed pontus &amp; ae&s;tus Mutaue|re &s;itum, rupit confinia Nereus Victor: &amp; ab&s;ci&s;sos interluit aequore montes, &amp;c.</HI> They which e&s;teeme the ilands of the midland &s;ea, according to their quantity and content, do make this the greate&s;t, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> who affirme this not only to excell the re&s;t for bigne&s;&s;e, but al&s;o for goodne&s;&s;e of &s;oile. As concerning the forme of this iland, <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> &s;aith it is like that Ca|pitall letter of the Greekes, which they call <HI>Delta.</HI> That the whole iland was con&s;ecrated to <HI>Ceres</HI> and <HI>Libera,</HI> that is, <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> all old writers do generally with one con&s;ent affirme: to <HI>Ceres</HI> it was dedicated, becau&s;e it fir&s;t taught the rules of &s;etting &amp; &s;owing of corne: to <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> not &s;o much for that &s;he was from hence violently taken by <HI>Pluto,</HI> as for that (which <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Diodo|rus</HI> do report for truth) <HI>Pluto,</HI> as &s;oone as &s;he vncouering her &s;elfe fir&s;t &s;hewed her&s;elfe to be &s;eene of him, gaue it her for a boone; which kind of gifts and fauours the Greekes call <HI>anacalypteria.</HI></P>
<P>Of the fertility and riches of this country, there is a famous te&s;timonie, written by the learned Oratour <HI>Cicero,</HI> in his &s;econd ora|tion again&s;t <HI>Verres,</HI> where he &s;aith that <HI>Marcus Cato</HI> did call it, <HI>The garner and &s;torehou&s;e of the Romane common wealth, and the nurce of the vulgar &s;ort.</HI> The &s;ame <HI>Cicero</HI> doth adde in that place, that it was not only the &s;torehou&s;e of the people of <HI>Rome,</HI> but al|&s;o it was accounted for a well furni&s;hed trea&s;urie: for without any co&s;t or charge of ours &s;aith he, it hath v&s;ually clothed, maintai|ned and furni&s;hed our greate&s;t armies with leather, apparell and corne. <HI>Strabo</HI> in his 6. booke reporteth almo&s;t the &s;ame thing of it. What&s;oeuer <HI>Sicilia</HI> doth yeeld, &s;aith <HI>Solinus,</HI> whether by the kindne&s;&s;e and temperature of the aire, or by the indu&s;try and labour of man, it is accounted next vnto tho&s;e things that are of be&s;t e&s;timation: were it not that &s;uch things as the earth fir&s;t putteth forth are ouergrowen with <HI>Centorui</HI> &s;affron <HI>(Crocus Ceturipinus). Ari&s;totle</HI> in his <HI>Admiranda,</HI> writeth, that about <HI>Pelorus (Cabo de la torre del Faro)</HI> &s;affron groweth in &s;uch abundance, that any man that li&s;teth may load and carie it away by whole cart loads. But <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> doth affirme, that that which groweth about <HI>Centuripinum</HI> (a towne now called <HI>Centorui</HI>) is much weaker and of le&s;&s;e force, than that which groweth in other places. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;aith, that in the fields neere <HI>Leontium, (Lintini)</HI> and in diuers other places of this iland, wheat doth grow of it &s;elfe, without any labour or looking to of the husbandman. That this iland was made a prouince fir&s;t before any other forren nation, among&s;t other <HI>Cicero</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> haue left recorded. <HI>Martianus</HI> &s;hew|eth that there were in it 6. colonies, and 60. cities. <HI>Pintianus,</HI> at the 8. c. of <HI>Plinies</HI> 3. booke, readeth 73. free colonies &amp; cities. <HI>Silius</HI> in his 14. booke, and <HI>Ouid</HI> in diuers places reckoneth vp the names of many of them: but this our mappe &s;peaketh of many more.</P>
<P>That it was in the beginning po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and inhabited by <HI>Giants, Lae&s;trigones, Anthropophagi,</HI> and <HI>Cyclopes</HI> barbarous and vnci|uill nations, all hi&s;tories and fables do iointly with one con&s;ent auerre. Yet <HI>Thucydides</HI> &s;aith that the&s;e &s;auage people dwelt only in one place of the iland. Afterward the <HI>Sicani,</HI> a nation of <HI>Spaine,</HI> &s;o called of the riuer <HI>Sicanus,</HI> (or as <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>Bero&s;us,</HI> haue giuen out, of their king <HI>Sicanus</HI>) driuen out of their country by the <HI>Ligures,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. That the&s;e <HI>Sicani</HI> were not bred in the ile (although &s;ome do &s;o thinke) <HI>Thucydides</HI> and <HI>Diodorus</HI> do con&s;tantly auouch. Of the&s;e it was named SICANIA. The <HI>Elymi</HI> and &s;ome of the <HI>Pho|cen&s;es,</HI> &s;eated them&s;elues heere: after them &s;ucceeded the <HI>Phryges</HI> driuen from <HI>Troy,</HI> as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> thinketh: and the <HI>Morgetes</HI> expel|led out of <HI>Italy</HI> by the <HI>Oenotri,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth. In <HI>Plutarch</HI> his <HI>Conuiual. Quae&s;t.</HI> and <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> his 2. booke <HI>de Manibus,</HI> I read that the <HI>Dores</HI> &s;ometime did inhabite it. La&s;tly, it was all conquered by the <HI>Siculi,</HI> a people of <HI>Italy</HI> ouerthrowen &amp; ca&s;t out of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by the <HI>Opici,</HI> and of them it was called SICILIA; when as before it was knowen by the name of TRINACIA, as <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> wri|teth: or TRINACRIS, as <HI>Ouid:</HI> or TRINACRIA and TRIQVETRA, as <HI>Pliny</HI> reporteth, of the triangular forme. Whereupon the Romans in their money were wont to counterfait or expre&s;&s;e this prouince by 3. legs ioined together about the vpper end of the thigh, (not much vnlike tho&s;e armes of the E. of <HI>Darby,</HI> as I thinke,) <HI>Lycophron</HI> for the &s;ame rea&s;on giueth it the title or epithite of TRICERVIX, 3. necked: and <HI>Pindarus</HI> in like maner calleth it TRICVSPIS, 3. pointed. <HI>Homer</HI> the prince of poets nameth it CYCLOPVM TERRA, the land of the <HI>Cyclopes,</HI> being peraduenture in his time not knowen by any proper name. <HI>Iulius Firmicus,</HI> &s;aith that the <HI>Siculi,</HI> the people of this iland, are acute and nimble witted: <HI>Quint.</HI> in his 6. booke of his <HI>Orat.</HI> &s;aith that they are la&s;ciuious and full of words.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides many famous acts done by the&s;e people both at home and abroad, a&s;well in peace as in war there be many other things which haue made this iland very renowmed: the birth of <HI>Ceres,</HI> the raui&s;hing of <HI>Pro&s;erpina,</HI> the Giant <HI>Enceladus,</HI> the wonderfull mathematician <HI>Archimedes,</HI> the famous geometrician <HI>Euclide,</HI> the painfull hi&s;torian <HI>Diodorus, Empedocles</HI> the deep philo&s;opher, the ingenious architecture of <HI>Daedalus,</HI> the tombe of <HI>Sibylla Cumana, Syracu&s;ae</HI> the famous <HI>tetrapolis,</HI> or as <HI>Strabo</HI> &s;aith, a <HI>pentapolis</HI> (one city made of 4. or 5. cities: like as <HI>London,</HI> in re&s;pect of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Southwarke,</HI> may be &s;aid to be a <HI>tripolis</HI>) the foun|taine <HI>Arethu&s;a,</HI> the lake <HI>Palicus,</HI> the mount <HI>AEtna, Scylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis,</HI> and the notorious harlot <HI>Lais.</HI> Be&s;ide many miracles and wonderfull workes of nature, which thou mai&s;t read of in <HI>Solinus, Trogus</HI> in his fourth booke, <HI>Antigonus de Mirab. l.</HI> and <HI>A|chilles Statius</HI> in his 2. booke of <HI>Loue: Item</HI> &s;tatues co&s;tly images, for art and curious workeman&s;hip of great e&s;timation; which are de&s;cribed by <HI>Cicero</HI> in his orations again&s;t <HI>Verres. Athenaeus</HI> commended highly the chee&s;e, doues and diuers &s;orts of garments of <HI>Sicilia. Antigonus</HI> writeth that the <HI>Cactos</HI> (a kind of thorne) doth grow in this ile, and not in any other place of the world be|&s;ide: as <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> affirmeth: vpon which if a &s;tagge &s;hall tread and pricke his foote, his bones will yeeld no &s;ound, and there|fore they wilbe naught to make pipes of. Heere al&s;o, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, is found the <HI>Smaragde,</HI> a kind of pretious &s;tone, of great e&s;ti|mation in tho&s;e daies: in the &s;ea, the &s;ame authour affirmeth, that Corall is gotten by &s;uch as do &s;eeke for it. <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> doth write, that this iland had at fir&s;t no hares, but &s;uch as were brought in by <HI>Anaxilas Rhegnius</HI> The Sicilian &s;ea, which beateth vpon this ile on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, was al&s;o called <HI>Au&s;onium mare,</HI> and was the deepe&s;t of all the Mediterran &s;ea, as <HI>Strabo</HI> te&s;tifieth. There is another iland in this &s;ea neere to <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> called <HI>Sicilia,</HI> as <HI>Stephanus</HI> reporteth. The ile <HI>Naxus (Nic&s;ia,</HI> it is now called in the <HI>AEgean</HI> or <HI>Archipelago, Pliny</HI> &s;aith, was &s;ometime named <HI>Sicilia minor, Sicilia,</HI> the le&s;&s;e. <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> al&s;o &s;peaketh of <HI>Sicilia</HI> a little hill not farre from <HI>Athens</HI> in <HI>Greece.</HI> Moreouer there is a place in the Palace of <HI>Rome,</HI> of that name, as <HI>Capitolinus</HI> hath left recorded in the life of <HI>Perlinax</HI> the Emperour. But the&s;e are by-matters nor &s;o directly to our purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Diuers adagies, prouerbs, or by-words haue &s;prong from hence: as <HI>Siculi&s;&s;are,</HI> &s;poken of one that is &s;ullen or tetchie: <HI>Siculum mare,</HI> the Sicilian &s;ea, meaning that which is dangerous: <HI>Siculus miles,</HI> A Sicilian &s;ouldier, that is, a mercenary or &s;tipendary: <HI>Si|culae gerrae,</HI> and <HI>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare charybdim,</HI> He falleth vpon the rockes that laboureth to &s;hunne the quicke &s;ands; &s;poken of him that coueting to e&s;cape one danger falleth into a wor&s;e.

<HEAD>DACIA, and MOESIA.</HEAD>
<P>_THe inhabitants of DACIA, the Greekes called DACI: the Latines GETAE; as <HI>Pliny, Dion, Ste|phanus</HI> and others do te&s;tifie: (This al&s;o <HI>Cotti&s;o,</HI> &s;ometime the King of that nation, doth confirme: whom <HI>Suetonius</HI> nameth, <HI>The king of the Getes;</HI> Horace calleth him, <HI>Dacum:</HI> a Dake) <HI>Item, Ior|nandes</HI> &s;aith, that the Romanes indifferently called them DACI, or GOTHI. I do ob&s;erue that <HI>Herodotus</HI> and the writers about that age haue generally comprehended them vnder the name of the SCYTHAE, <HI>Scythians:</HI> to whom al&s;o the fore&s;aid <HI>Iornandes</HI> doth wholly a&s;&s;ent and agree, <HI>Item,</HI> the abouenamed <HI>Stephanus</HI> nameth them DAOS and <HI>Strabo</HI> DAVOS, <HI>Daces,</HI> or <HI>Dawes,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding maketh this di&s;tinction betweene them: that the <HI>Getae</HI> were tho&s;e which were &s;eated farther Ea&s;tward; the <HI>Daci,</HI> tho&s;e which dwelt more into the We&s;t: Notwith&s;tanding they &s;peake one and the &s;ame language: namely, the Duche tongue, v&s;ed al&s;o by the <HI>Thracians,</HI> as may be demon&s;trated out of <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Iornandes.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Arrianus</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Getae</HI> were al&s;o called APATHONI|ZONTES: but it is to be amended: and out of <HI>Herodotus</HI> fir&s;t booke, to be written ATHANATIZONTES, as who &s;ay, <HI>Immor|tall:</HI> for they do verily beleeue, that they &s;hal neuer die: but after their departure out of this life, go pre&s;ently vnto one <HI>Zamolxis,</HI> a Saint or Idol which they e&s;pecially wor&s;hip and adore. But of this their Saint and ceremonie you may read more in the &s;aid authour. <HI>Suidas</HI> &s;heweth that in his time the&s;e people were knowen by the name of the PATZINACITAE. That tho&s;e Dakes did inhabite on either &s;ide of the riuer <HI>Donaw (Danubius)</HI> euen vp as high as mount <HI>Haemus,</HI> I do find recorded by <HI>Dion:</HI> whom I do perceiue, vnder that name, to conteine al&s;o the <HI>Moe&s;i.</HI> And indeed we &s;hall heereafter proue that the &s;ame Dakes were often tran&s;lated afterward into the&s;e Moe&s;iaes. Therefore Saint <HI>Paullinus,</HI> for that rea&s;on, maketh this &s;ame DACIA twofold, in his treati&s;e Of the returne of <HI>Nicetas,</HI> in this ver&s;e; <HI>Et Getae currunt, &amp; vterque Dacus:</HI> The Getes in troupes doe throng, both Dakes they do the like. In the Dige&s;ts of the ciuill law mention is made of two Daciaes. But of the Moe&s;iaes we will &s;peake heereafter, this place we haue a&s;&s;igned to the true DACIA, properly &s;o called, who&s;e bounds <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> the Prince of all Geographers, maketh to be the riuers <HI>Donaw (Danubius) Tei&s;&s;a (Tibi&s;cus</HI> or <HI>Pathi&s;&s;us,</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> nameth it) <HI>Pruth (Hiera&s;us)</HI> and the mount <HI>Carpates.

Aurelius Victor, Eutropius, Marcellinus, Comes,</HI> the booke of Remembrances, and the Mi&s;cellan &s;tory, do diuide this country into two prouinces, MEDI|TERRANEA and RIPENSIS: There are &s;ome (of which <HI>Lazius</HI> is one) that to tho&s;e do adde a third called ALPESTRIS, vp|on what ground and proofe, I know not. VANNIANVM REGNVM, of which <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> do &s;peake, was, as &s;eemeth heere abouts. This is properly that prouince of <HI>Dacia,</HI> which <HI>Eutropius</HI> &s;aith did conteine in circuite a thou&s;and miles. The chiefe city of this part was <HI>Zarmi&s;ogethu&s;a,</HI> which afterward was called COLONIA VLPIA TRAIANA AVG. DACIC. ZARMIS. as we find in certaine in&s;criptions in Marble, and was &s;o named of <HI>Vlpius Traianus</HI> the Emperour. For he fir&s;t by conquering ouercomming their king <HI>Decebalus,</HI> made it a prouince. Of which warre, made by <HI>Traiane</HI> again&s;t the Dakes, (for the hi&s;tories of it, written by him&s;elfe, cited by <HI>Pri&s;cian</HI> the Grammarian, are lo&s;t) you may read in <HI>Dion</HI> in the life of this Emperour. Behold al&s;o and view the columne &s;et vp by the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Traianes</HI> market place, which yet to this day re|maineth whole and &s;ound. This columne, <HI>Hieronymus Mutianus</HI> the famous painter, &s;haddowed out with his owne hand and imprinted at <HI>Rome,</HI> in 130. tables. The &s;ame hath <HI>F. Alphon&s;us Ciacconus</HI> &s;o liuely expre&s;&s;ed and declared with &s;uch a learned and laborious Commentary, that in it a man would thinke that he had rather &s;een this battell fought, than to haue read or heard ought of the &s;ame, from the relation of others. <HI>Florus</HI> writeth, <HI>that this country doth lie amid the mountaines. Item,</HI> he calleth it, <HI>a cop&s;y country, full of woods and forre&s;ts.</HI> For he affirmeth that <HI>Curio</HI> came vp as high as <HI>Dacia,</HI> but dur&s;t go no fur|ther, for feare of the dreadfull darke woods. <HI>Strabo</HI> in the &s;euenth booke of his Geographie, and <HI>Virgil</HI> in the third of his Ge|orgickes, do &s;peake of the de&s;erts and wilderne&s;&s;es of the Getes. The &s;ame authour calleth it, <HI>Gentem indomitam,</HI> an vnruelie nation. <HI>Statius</HI> &s;aith, that they are <HI>hir&s;uti,</HI> hairie, <HI>inton&s;i,</HI> vn&s;horne, <HI>pelliti,</HI> furred or clad in skins, inhumane, &s;turdy, &s;tern, <HI>braccati,</HI> wearing long &s;ide breeches and mantles, like to our Iri&s;hmen. I read in <HI>Pliny</HI> that they v&s;ed <HI>to paint their faces</HI> [like vnto our Britans.] That there is not a more &s;tern nation in the World, <HI>Ouid</HI> the Poet, who did not only &s;ee the country, but al&s;o dwelt among&s;t them and &s;aw their manners, very truly wrote of them. <HI>Vegetius,</HI> who wrote of the Art of warre, &s;aith that it is <HI>a very warlike people:</HI> Hauing indeed, as the Prince of Poets te&s;tifieth, god <HI>Mars for their Lieutenant and Gouernour.</HI> Of <HI>Claudian,</HI> it is named, <HI>Bellipotens,</HI> a mighty nation for warlike men. <HI>Philargyrius,</HI> out of <HI>Aufidius Mode&s;tus</HI> writeth, that when they go to warre, they will not &s;et forward, before they drinking downe a certaine mea&s;ure of the waters of the riuer <HI>I&s;ter (Donaw)</HI> in the maner of hallowed wine, do &s;weare that they would neuer returne home againe into their owne country, vntill they had &s;laine their enemies. Whereupon <HI>Virgil</HI> called this riuer <HI>I&s;trum Coniuratum,</HI> coniured <HI>Donaw. Trogus</HI> wri|teth, that this nation, with their king <HI>Orotes,</HI> (another copy hath <HI>Olores:</HI> in <HI>Dion</HI> I read, <HI>Roles</HI>) did fight again&s;t the Ba&s;tarnae, with very ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e: in reuenge of which cowardi&s;e, they were by their king enioined, when they go to bed, to lie at the beds feet: or to do tho&s;e &s;eruices to their wiues, which they were wont to do for them. They were in times pa&s;t &s;o &s;trong, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that they were able to make an army of 200000. men. Of them al&s;o peraduenture this &s;peech of <HI>Silius Itali|cus</HI> is to be vnder&s;tood: <HI>At gente in Scythica &s;uffixa cadauera truncis, Lenta dies &s;epelit putri liquentia tabo.</HI> Io&s;ephus in his &s;e|cond booke again&s;t <HI>Appian</HI> writeth there are a certaine kind of Dakes commonly called <HI>Pli&s;ti,</HI> who&s;e manner of life he com|pareth to the cour&s;e of life of the <HI>E&s;&s;enes.</HI> The&s;e I do verily beleeue are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which <HI>Strabo</HI> calleth <HI>Pli&s;tae</HI> and were of the &s;tocke of the <HI>Abij.</HI> And thus much of <HI>Dacia,</HI> now the <HI>Moe&s;i</HI> do follow, who, as <HI>Dion Pru&s;aeus</HI> noteth out of <HI>Homer,</HI> were &s;ometime named <HI>My&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>By the name of MOESIA was all that country vulgarly called, which the riuer <HI>Saw (Sauus)</HI> falling into <HI>Donaw,</HI> aboue <HI>Dal|matia, Macedonia</HI> and <HI>Thracia,</HI> doth diuide from <HI>Pannonia.</HI> In the which <HI>Moe&s;ia,</HI> be&s;ide diuers other nations, there do inhabit tho&s;e which anciently were named the <HI>Triballi,</HI> and tho&s;e which now are called <HI>Dardani.</HI> The&s;e are the wordes of <HI>Dion Ni|caeus.</HI> It is by <HI>Ptolemey</HI> enclo&s;ed and bounded with the &s;ame limits. <HI>Pliny</HI> al&s;o doth extend the coa&s;ts of it from the meeting of the riuer <HI>Saw</HI> with <HI>Donaw,</HI> euen vnto <HI>Pontus (Mar maiore)</HI> Ea&s;tward: and <HI>Iornandes</HI> maketh it to reach as farre as <HI>Hi&s;tria,</HI> We&s;tward. We haue &s;aid before, that MOESIA was &s;ometime called DACIA: for proofe whereof I could alledge <HI>Flauius Vopi&s;cus:</HI> who writeth that <HI>Aurelianus</HI> the Emperour, borne heere, did bring certaine people out of <HI>Dacia,</HI> and placed them in MOESIA and to haue named it DACIA AVRELIANA, after his owne name, which is now that prouince that diuideth

And <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> &s;heweth, that by the &s;ame Emperour, there were two <HI>Da|ciaes</HI> made of the countries of <HI>Moe&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Dardania:</HI> whereupon in the Code of the ciuill law the&s;e wordes are read, <HI>Mediter|ranca My&s;ia, &s;eu Dardania:</HI> vpland Moe&s;ia, or Dardania: confounding the one with the other. Vnderneath the name of <HI>Da|cia,</HI> be&s;ide tho&s;e countries abouenamed, was conteined al&s;o PRAEVALITANA, and that part of <HI>Macedonia</HI> commonly called SALVTARIS, as the booke of Remembrances <HI>(liber Notitiarum)</HI> doth manife&s;tly affirme. Of the people heere, brought from other places, <HI>Strabo</HI> likewi&s;e writeth, that in his time (who we know liued in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI>) by <HI>AElius Catus</HI> (or rather, as the learned and indu&s;trious <HI>Cau&s;abon</HI> out of <HI>Dion</HI> would haue vs read, <HI>Licinius Cra&s;&s;us:</HI>) were conueighed of the Getes which dwelt eyond the <HI>Donaw (I&s;ter)</HI> into <HI>Thracia,</HI> more than 50000. men, and were afterward called MYSI, <HI>My&s;ians.</HI> An in&s;cription of an ancient &s;tone, mentioned in <HI>Smetius</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>AElius Plautius</HI> propraetor of <HI>Moe&s;ia,</HI> did tran&s;port into this country, of the people and nations beyond the <HI>Donaw,</HI> more than 10000. men, together with their wiues, children, nobles, princes and kings.

Neither doth this &s;eeme to be altogether fal&s;e or vn|probable; for the name <HI>Waiachia</HI> or <HI>Valachia,</HI> whereby it is knowe~ at this day doth import &s;o much.

To which an&s;weare they replied againe, So you are indeed, if you can conquer vs. <HI>Po&s;idonius</HI> in <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth, that they forbeare the eating of fle&s;h for religion and con&s;cience &s;ake: and do feed only vpon butter and chee&s;e.

Of the <HI>Triballi,</HI> a people of this country take this of <HI>Pliny</HI> as he alleadgeth it out of <HI>I&s;igonus.</HI> They do bewitch and kill with their eies &s;uch as they do &s;tedfa&s;tly looke vpon, any long time together; e&s;pecially if they be angrie: which mi&s;chiefe of theirs, &s;trip|lings are mo&s;t &s;ubiect vnto, and &s;oone&s;t hurt by. But that is mo&s;t notable and worth the ob&s;eruation, that in ech eie they haue two &s;ights apeece.

Gyraldus</HI> in his <HI>Syntagmata Deorum,</HI> affirmeth, that the kings of <HI>Babylon</HI> were wont to re&s;erue certaine of the water of <HI>Donaw</HI> or <HI>I&s;ter,</HI> in ther trea&s;uries among&s;t their pretious iewels. <HI>Cae&s;arius, Nazianzenus</HI> brother, in his dialogues &s;aith, that this is one of the riuers of Paradi&s;e: and to be that which the holy Scripture calleth <HI>Phi&s;on:</HI> which I will ea&s;ily grant him to be true, when he &s;hall per&s;wade me, that by Paradi&s;e is meant the whole world or ma&s;&s;ie globe of this lower element of the earth: which I do verily beleeue he thought to be true. <HI>Seneca,</HI> in the &s;ixth booke of his naturall Philo&s;ophy, &s;aith, that this <HI>Donaw</HI> doth part <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all writers generally both Latines and Greekes, a&s;well ancient as tho&s;e of later times do attribute this to the riuer <HI>Done (Tanais.)</HI> And what is he, I pray you, that euer dreamed that <HI>Germany</HI> which is beyond this riuer &s;hould be a country of <HI>A&s;ia?</HI> Shall we correct the copy? Or &s;hall we retaine that reading in <HI>Horace,</HI> vpon the credit and perill of <HI>Acron</HI> his expo&s;itour? where he &s;aith, that <HI>Tanais</HI> is al&s;o called <HI>Danubius.</HI> I leaue it to the cen&s;ure of the learned. (This we know for a certainty a&s;well <HI>Tanais</HI> as <HI>Danubius,</HI> is of the inhabitants neere about, called <HI>Done:</HI> and &s;urely I thinke that both the Greeke <HI>Tanais,</HI> as the Latine <HI>Danubius,</HI> were made of the barbarous <HI>Done</HI> or <HI>Tane;</HI> which in that language peraduenture for ought I know, may &s;ignifie a riuer or &s;treame: &s;o <HI>Nilas,</HI> as <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> &s;eemeth to affirme tooke his name of <HI>Nuchul,</HI> which generally &s;ignifieth a ri|uer, as all men meanly skild in Hebrew or Arabicke can te&s;tifie with him.) <HI>I&s;idore</HI> al&s;o in the ninth chapter of the &s;euenteenth booke of his <HI>Origines,</HI> &s;eemeth to be of this opinion, where he writeth that <HI>Rhabarbarum,</HI> rhew barbe, groweth in <HI>&s;olo barba|rico,</HI> in a barbarous country, beyond the <HI>Donaw:</HI> For we know at this day, that it groweth neere the riuer <HI>Rha,</HI> which is be|yond the <HI>Donaw</HI> Ea&s;tward. In <HI>Pliny</HI> we read that euery one of his mouthes, whereby it emptieth it &s;elfe into the &s;ea, are &s;o wide and great, that it is affirmed to ouercome the &s;ea for forty miles in length together, and that &s;o farre the waters may be perceiued to be &s;weet amid the bracki&s;h &s;urges of the &s;alt &s;ea. <HI>Polybius</HI> in his fourth booke to the&s;e adioineth, that by the vio|lent and &s;wift fall of the waters of this riuer into <HI>Pontus (Mar maiore)</HI> there are certaine knols, hils, or &s;helfs, which the &s;ea|men call <HI>Stethe,</HI> that is, brea&s;t bones, made of the gathering together of &s;uch things as the riuer bringeth downe with it, and are more than a day &s;aile off from land, vpon which oft times the &s;eamen falling by negligence, are in great danger of &s;hip|wracke. <HI>Strabo</HI> al&s;o maketh mention of the &s;ame. They which de&s;ire to know more of this riuer, his name, nature, quality, fountaine, mouthes, and &s;treames which do runne into it, let him read the commentaries of <HI>William Stuckius</HI> written vpon <HI>Arrianus Periplus</HI> of the Euxine &s;ea: for there he hath mo&s;t plentifully and learnedly de&s;cr bed all the&s;e things.

Procopius</HI> &s;aith that it was &s;ometime named <HI>Tanais,</HI> vnfitly and fal&s;ly, as I thinke. Almo&s;t all ancient writers haue likened this &s;ea (or more truly, this bay or gulfe) vnto a Scythian bow when it is bent: &s;o that the &s;tring doth repre&s;ent the South part of it: namely from the &s;treights of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> vnto the further end of it Ea&s;tward, toward the riuer <HI>Pha&s;is:</HI> for excepting only the promontory <HI>Carambis, (Cabo Pi&s;ello)</HI> all the re&s;t of this &s;hore hath &s;uch &s;mall capes and creekes, that it is not much vnlike to a right line. The other &s;ide or North part doth re|&s;emble an horne that hath two crooked ends, the vpper end more round: the lower more &s;traight: which proportion this our mappe doth very preci&s;ely expre&s;&s;e. This &s;ea al&s;o hath two promontories; one in the South, then called <HI>Promontorium Carambis,</HI> now <HI>Cabo Pi&s;ello:</HI> the other in the North, <HI>Ptole|mey</HI> nameth it <HI>Criou metopon, Arietis frons,</HI> the rammes head: <HI>Paulus Diaconus</HI> calleth it <HI>Acroma,</HI> and now it is knowen by the name <HI>Famar.</HI> The&s;e two capes are oppo&s;ite one again&s;t the other, and are di&s;tant one from another about 2500. furlongs, as <HI>Ammianus</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> do te&s;tifie: which although they do make 312. Italian miles, yet they are di&s;tant only 170. miles, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith: or as <HI>Strabo</HI> reporteth, &s;o much as a &s;hip will &s;aile in three daies: not|with&s;tanding to tho&s;e, which do &s;aile either from the Ea&s;t to We&s;t, or from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, they &s;eeme to be &s;o neere one to the other, that one would thinke that there were the end of the &s;ea, and that <HI>Pontus Euxinus</HI> were two &s;eas: but when you &s;hall come in the midde&s;t between the&s;e two capes, then the other part appeareth, as it were a &s;econd or another &s;ea. The compa&s;&s;e of it round about by the &s;hore <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh to be 25000. furlongs: <HI>Polybius</HI> but 22000. and yet from this <HI>Ammianus</HI> taketh 2000. and that by the authority of <HI>Erato&s;thenes, Hecataeus</HI> and <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> as there he affirmeth. <HI>Herodotus</HI> an eie-witne&s;&s;e of the &s;ame, writeth that he mea&s;ured the length of it and found it to be 11100. furlongs: and likewi&s;e he found the breadth of it (where it was furthe&s;t ouer) to be 320. furlongs. This mea&s;ure <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> in the twelfth chapter of his fourth booke, do more di&s;tinctly, partly out of their owne and partly out of other mens opinions, &s;et downe. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that about 40. riuers do vnloade them&s;elues into it. Yet this our mappe doth &s;hew many more. Antiquity doth hold that this &s;ea, of all our &s;eas, was by farre the greate&s;t; (heere hence I &s;uppo&s;e that the Italians haue giuen it that name of <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> the Great &s;ea) and that heere (as there at <HI>Caliz,</HI> without the &s;traits of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) was the end of the World: and that it was innaui|gable, both for the huge greatne&s;&s;e of it, as al&s;o by rea&s;on of the barbarous nations which daily did annoy the &s;hore, and v&s;e all maner of cruelty and in|humanity toward &s;trangers and aliens. From hence aro&s;e tho&s;e epithites and adiuncts giuen by the ancient poets to this &s;ea of <HI>Pontus; va&s;t and rough, Virgil</HI> and <HI>Catullus</HI> call it: <HI>Ouid, infinite</HI> and <HI>terrible: Lucane, a deuouring</HI> and <HI>dangerous &s;ea; Silius, raging: Statius, an vncertaine</HI> and <HI>&s;welling &s;ea: Valerius Flaccus, perilous: Manilius, horrible, &s;pitefull</HI> and <HI>furious: Seneca, mad</HI> and <HI>churli&s;h: Fe&s;tus Auienus, rauci&s;onum,</HI> making a hoar&s;e ill fauoured noi&s;e. Thus farre of the Names, Forme and bigne&s;&s;e of this &s;ea: of the Situation and Nature of the &s;ame, although <HI>Herodotus, Pomponius, Strabo, Pliny, Ouid</HI> and <HI>Macrobius</HI> (that I may &s;ay nothing of others) haue &s;poken much, yet in mine opinion, no man hath done it more exactly and diligently than <HI>Ammianus</HI> in his 22. booke; whom he that li&s;teth, may adioine to this our di&s;cour&s;e: and if he be not &s;atisfied with the&s;e, he may to them adde a whole booke, writ|ten by <HI>Arrianus</HI> of this &s;ea: together with the large commentaries, of <HI>Struckius,</HI> vpon the &s;ame. As for vs we will content our &s;elues in this place with a few peculiar ob&s;eruations of this &s;ea, gleaned heere and there out of the ancient monuments of learned writers of former ages. <HI>It is &s;weet,</HI> or at lea&s;twi&s;e more &s;weet than other &s;eas: moreouer, <HI>the waters of it are more light than others; and do neuer ebbe and flow,</HI> but alwaies keep one and the &s;ame &s;tint of run|ning one way, as <HI>Lucrece, Macrobius, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Ouid</HI> do witne&s;&s;e. Which I take to be the cau&s;e that &s;ometime it hath all been frozen ouer. For this I re|member I haue read, in <HI>Ouid, Marcell. Comit.</HI> and others, &s;ometime to haue happened. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> in his Problemes writeth, <HI>That it is whiter than other &s;eas:</HI> (yet the Greekes now call it <HI>Maurothala&s;&s;a,</HI> and likewi&s;e the Turkes <HI>Caradenis,</HI> that is, as <HI>Lucian</HI> doth interpret them both, <HI>Mare nigrum,</HI> the Blacke &s;ea. Contrariwi&s;e <HI>mare Aegeum,</HI> the Archipelago, or Mediterran &s;ea, the Turkes call <HI>Acdeniz,</HI> and the vulgar Greekes <HI>A&s;pra thala&s;&s;a,</HI> both &s;ignifying as the learned <HI>Leunclaw</HI> expoundeth them, <HI>Mare album,</HI> the white &s;ea.) <HI>Aelianus</HI> in his <HI>Varia hi&s;toria</HI> writeth, <HI>That it breedeth no tender or &s;oft &s;helfi&s;h,</HI> but ve|ry &s;eldome and tho&s;e very few. <HI>It feedeth no Whales,</HI> only certaine &s;mall &s;eales, and pretty little dolphins &s;ometimes are heere taken, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Morals</HI> hath left recorded. <HI>There is no rauenous creature that praieth vpon fi&s;h doth liue in it,</HI> be&s;ide &s;eales and dolphines, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth. <HI>Strabo</HI> in the &s;e|uenth booke of his Geography &s;aith, <HI>That there are about</HI> 40. <HI>riuers,</HI> which comming from diuers quarters do vnload them&s;elues into it. Yet we, in this our Mappe, do point at a great many more be&s;ide. The cities, vpon the coa&s;t of this &s;ea, more famous, are BYZANTIVM, <HI>(Con&s;tantinople)</HI> of which we will &s;ay nothing in this place, becau&s;e we haue before in the mappe of <HI>Thrace</HI> written of it at large, in re&s;pect of the narrowne&s;&s;e of the place which is a&s;&s;igned for &s;uch like purpo&s;es. Then TOMOS (<HI>Tomi&s;uar,</HI> as <HI>Calcagninus;</HI> or <HI>Kiouia,</HI> as <HI>Ciof&aacute;nus</HI> thinketh) famous by the bani&s;hment and exile of the noble poet <HI>Ouid.</HI> BORYSTHENES, otherwi&s;e called <HI>Olbia</HI> and <HI>Miletopolis, (Strapenor,</HI> a city in <HI>Sarmatia Europaea,</HI> &s;ituate at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Bori|&s;thenes</HI>) of which <HI>Dion Pru&s;aeus</HI> hath &s;poken much (that I may omit others) in his 16. oration. DIOSCVRIAS, which was al&s;o called <HI>Seba&s;topolis,</HI> built, if you will giue any credit to poeticall fables, by the waggoners of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux:</HI> it is yet to this day knowen by the name of <HI>Sauatopoli</HI> or <HI>Saua&s;topoli.</HI> This city was in times pa&s;t &s;o famous, as <HI>Pliny</HI> telleth out of <HI>Timo&s;thenes,</HI> that there ordinarily re&s;orted vnto it 300. &s;euerall nations, &s;peaking &s;o many dif|ferent languages: &s;o that the Romanes for the di&s;patch of all matters for their &s;tate, did maintaine there 130. interpretours. There are heere many other cities, which were nothing &s;o renowmed, as TRAPEZVS (now vulgarly called TREBIZONDA: of the Turkes, <HI>Taraba&s;&s;on:</HI> but of the barbarous nati|ons neere adioining, as <HI>Theuet</HI> reporteth, <HI>Waccamah:</HI> CERASVS (<HI>Chera&s;oda,</HI> or as the barbarous people call it, <HI>Omidie</HI>) PHARNACEA <HI>(Platena)</HI> A|MISVS (<HI>Amid</HI> or <HI>Hemid,</HI> or as <HI>Niger</HI> thinketh <HI>Simi&s;o</HI>) SINOPE (<HI>Pordapas,</HI> yet the Turkes to this day call it <HI>Sinabe</HI>) HERACLEA (<HI>Aupop,</HI> and <HI>Penda|rachia</HI>) and oueragain&s;t <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> where we began, is CHALCEDON (<HI>Chalcidona,</HI> or as the Turkes terme it, <HI>Caltitiu</HI>) a free city and of great com|mand in tho&s;e daies, but now as <HI>P. Gyllius</HI> &s;aith, it is a &s;mall &s;treet without any mention of wals. Vpon the We&s;t &s;ide of this &s;ea, the Thracians did dwell: vpon the South the A&s;ians: as the <HI>Bithynians, Galatians</HI> and <HI>Cappadocians.</HI> The <HI>Colchi</HI> did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the Ea&s;tern coa&s;t. All along generally vpon the North a&s;well in <HI>Europe</HI> as <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> inhabited the <HI>Sarmatians</HI> and <HI>Scythians,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed into diuers and &s;undry nations: among&s;t the&s;e are the <HI>Tauro&s;cythi|ans,</HI> (which tooke their name from thence) and their <HI>Cherronne&s;us,</HI> or demy-ile, vulgarly knowen by the name of <HI>Taurica Cherronne&s;us,</HI> and <HI>Scythica Cherronne&s;us. Appianus</HI> nameth it <HI>Pontica Cherronne&s;us,</HI> the demy-ile of <HI>Pontus:</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, was &s;ometime inuironed round with the &s;ea. For forme and quality it is compared and thought to be much like <HI>Peloponne&s;us. Strabo,</HI> from the mouth or relation of others, hath left written, that it was &s;ometime annexed to the maine land by an <HI>i&s;thmos,</HI> or neckeland of 360. furlongs in length. The country toward <HI>Metopon (Frons Arietis</HI> the rammes head) is rough, mountainous and much &s;ubiect to Northren &s;tormes, cold and violent bla&s;ts. Neere to <HI>Theodo&s;ia, (Caffa</HI> or <HI>Cofe,</HI> as the Turkes write it: a city &s;ituate vpon the &s;ea, who&s;e hauen is &s;o capacious and large, that it is able to entertaine an hundred tall &s;hippes at once) it is a good and fertile &s;oile. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> writeth that <HI>bulbi,</HI> certaine bolled rootes, which do grow heere of their owne accord, are &s;o &s;weet and plea&s;ant that they may be eaten raw. In it al&s;o is the hill <HI>Bero&s;us,</HI> where, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, are three wels, of which, who&s;oeuer drinketh, he dieth without any griefe and without any remedy. <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Tanais,</HI> maketh mention of an oile made in this mountaine <HI>Bero&s;us,</HI> which the country people do pre&s;&s;e out of a certaine plant which they call <HI>Halinda.</HI> With this oile they annoint them&s;elues, and then being once warme they feele not the cold although it be neuer &s;o bitter. The &s;ame authour telleth of the hearb <HI>Phryxa,</HI> which groweth about <HI>Borea antrum,</HI> the caue <HI>Borea,</HI> which if the &s;tepchildren &s;hall haue about them, they &s;hall &s;uf|fer no wrong at their &s;tepmothers hand. This hearb is colder than Snow: yet as &s;oone as euer the &s;tepmothers &s;hall go about to wrong their &s;onne in lawes, it pre&s;ently ca&s;teth out flames of fire: and by that meanes they &s;hunne all eminent dangers and cau&s;es of feare. Thus far of <HI>Cherronne&s;us Taurica.</HI></P>
<P>They which take any plea&s;ure in fables or fictions of poets belonging to this <HI>Pontus</HI> or &s;poken of the &s;ame, let them haue recour&s;e to <HI>Senecan Medra,</HI> or the <HI>Iphigenia</HI> of <HI>Euripides,</HI> and others that haue written of the voiages of the <HI>Argonautes,</HI> or the &s;tory of <HI>Ia&s;ons Golden fleece.</HI> But before I leaue this &s;ea I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to put thee in mind what <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> writeth in the 11. chapter of his 9. booke of the Antiquity of the Iewes. Hee there &s;aith that <HI>Ionas</HI> the Prophet being deuoured and &s;wallowed vp of the whale about <HI>I&s;&s;icus finus (Golfo de Atazzo,</HI> a bay of the mediterran &s;ea, neere to <HI>I&s;&s;us,</HI> a city of <HI>Sili|cia,</HI> which now they vulgarly call <HI>Atazzo</HI>) was after three daies ca&s;t vp againe, into this Euxine &s;ea, aliue vnhurt or any way peri&s;hed. One part of this his relation I will beleeue, if you will beleeue the other. <HI>Robertus Con&s;tantinus</HI> in his &s;upplement of the Latine tongue &s;aith, that <HI>Lamia</HI> was a fi&s;h. Of the fenne MAEOTIS, (<HI>Mar delle Sabacche,</HI> it is commonly called now a daies: the Italians, of a towne abuttant vpon it, name it <HI>Mar della Tana,</HI> and <HI>Mar bianco,</HI> the white &s;ea: of the Scythians it is called <HI>Carpaluc:</HI> of the Arabians <HI>Bohari'lazach,</HI> as <HI>Bapti&s;ta Ramu&s;ius</HI> witne&s;&s;eth) be&s;ide other Geographers, read <HI>Polyb.</HI> in his 4. booke, and <HI>Ari&s;t.</HI> in the end of his 1. booke, and beginning of the 2. of his <HI>Meteor.</HI> The length of it is 6000. as <HI>Themi&s;tius Euphrada</HI> writeth. In this &s;ea there are not many ilands, yet the&s;e are not all inhabited or manured; and the people which dwell in them do liue very poorly: for they v&s;e the fle&s;h of great fi&s;hes, dried in the &s;unne, and then beaten and &s;tamped to powder, in &s;teed or meale for bread: for as <HI>Pomponeus</HI> &s;aith, they yeeld no great &s;tore of proui&s;ion for victuals.</P>

<P>_VNder the name of <HI>THRACIA</HI> many and diuer&s;e countries with &s;undry people are comprehended: for except the Indies it is the greate&s;t country of the world as <HI>Herodotus</HI> doth te&s;tifie: for <HI>Pliny</HI> doth confine it by the riuer <HI>I&s;ter, Pontus, Propon|tis,</HI> the Aegean &s;ea, and the riuer <HI>Strymon.</HI> Yea and <HI>Strabo</HI> in the fir&s;t booke of his Geography, according to the opinion of <HI>Homer,</HI> extendeth it as farre that way as the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> which riuer <HI>Ptolemey</HI> attributeth to <HI>Macedonia. Mar|cellinus</HI> maketh the Scordi&s;ci to be a people of this country. <HI>Appianus</HI> to the&s;e conioineth the Illyrians. So al&s;o doth <HI>Mela</HI> vpon the We&s;t, who moreouer vpon the South to it doth a&s;&s;igne the mount <HI>Athos.</HI> Many of the ancient writers likewi&s;e doe make the penin&s;ula or demy-iland <HI>Pallene,</HI> a portion belonging to this country. Yea if one may credit <HI>Erato&s;thenes,</HI> the hill <HI>Olympus</HI> doth part <HI>Macedonia</HI> from <HI>Thrace.</HI> And the Epitome of <HI>Strabo</HI> in his &s;euenth booke maketh yet a farre other de&s;cription of the bounds of this region. (For in <HI>Strabo</HI> him&s;elfe the de&s;cription of <HI>Thracia</HI> is wholly mi&s;&s;ing.) This Epitome, I &s;ay, &s;euereth <HI>Thrace</HI> from <HI>Macedony</HI> by the mouth of the riuer <HI>Ne&s;&s;us.</HI> Yea and indeed in &s;uccedent ages the compa&s;&s;e of this country was not much le&s;&s;e: for <HI>Ammianus, Procopius, Sextus Rufus,</HI> and the booke of Records <HI>(Notiti|arum)</HI> do diuide it into the&s;e &s;ixe &s;hires or prouinces; <HI>Moe&s;ia,</HI> the Second or Lower, <HI>Scythia, Europa,</HI> (peculiarly calling this part by the generall name of that quarter of the world wherein the whole did &s;tand) <HI>Rhodopa, Haemimontus,</HI> and <HI>Thracia,</HI> properly and &s;pecially &s;o called. Heere hence it is that in <HI>Trebellius</HI> and <HI>Oro&s;ius;</HI> there is mention made of the <HI>THRACIA'S,</HI> in the plurall number. Yet this our Mappe is not &s;o farre extended toward the North. For we haue indeed followed the de&s;cription of <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in butting and bounding it; who &s;euereth it from other Northren countries by the mount <HI>Haemus.</HI> And this true <HI>THRACIA</HI> we do thinke to haue beene &s;o named of the inchanting Nymph <HI>Thraca,</HI> as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> out of <HI>Athenaeus</HI> teacheth vs; hauing been in former times called <HI>PERCA:</HI> And had beene al&s;o &s;ometime, as many do verily thinke, knowne by the names of <HI>ARIA, ODRYSA, CRE|STONIA</HI> and <HI>SCYTONIA. Io&s;ephus</HI> a mo&s;t graue authour affirmeth, that it was of the Iewes called <HI>THYRAS.</HI> The abouenamed <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in it na|meth the&s;e foureteene &s;hires, <HI>Dantheletica, Sardica, V&s;dicefica, Selletica, Moedica, Dro&s;ica, Coeletica, Sapaica, Corpialica, Coenica, Be&s;&s;ica, Bennica, Samaica,</HI> and <HI>Vrbana. Plinie</HI> diuideth it into fifty (or two and fifty, as I remember <HI>Dalechampius</HI> hath) Regiments, <HI>(Strategiae)</HI> &s;hirewickes, I thinke, they call them in &s;ome places of <HI>England,</HI> Hundreds, or Wapentakes I would call them. This <HI>Thracia,</HI> properly &s;o called, <HI>Ammianus</HI> likeneth vnto the halfe Moone: or, to a Theater, who&s;e higher part is enclo&s;ed with high and &s;teep mountaines, which do diuide this &s;ame country from <HI>Dacia;</HI> The lower part openeth toward the Aegean &s;ea.</P>
<P>Of the nature and quality of this country, <HI>Virgil</HI> &s;peaketh on this manner: <HI>Terra procul va&s;tis colitur Mauortia campis:</HI> A martiall country li'th farre off, va&s;t champions it conteinth: <HI>Plutarch</HI> teacheth vs that it hath in it many huge fennes and bogges, and that it is diuided or cro&s;&s;ed this way and that way by diuer&s;e deep and dangerous riuers. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith that the &s;oile of <HI>Thracia</HI> is very fertile for all manner of corne, and commendeth the wheat of the &s;ame, for waight and heauine&s;&s;e: <HI>Item,</HI> for goodne&s;&s;e he affirmeth that this kinde of wheat po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the third place. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> te&s;tifieth that it beareth &s;ome vines, e&s;pecially about <HI>Biblina,</HI> which otherwi&s;e is called <HI>Oe&s;yma. Item, Pliny</HI> highly commendeth <HI>Vinum Maroneum,</HI> the wine of <HI>Marogna,</HI> or <HI>Marolia,</HI> as <HI>Lewnclawe</HI> calleth it. <HI>Homer</HI> al&s;o affirmeth, that the Achiui were wont, by &s;hippe to tran&s;port wines from <HI>Thace</HI> into <HI>Grecce. Xenophon</HI> writeth, that in the mount <HI>Pangeus,</HI> there is a gold-mine: and <HI>Strabo</HI> affirmeth the like to be about <HI>Philippi.</HI> Heere al&s;o is the <HI>Thracian &s;tone,</HI> which is kindled by the water, and quenched with oile, as <HI>Pliny</HI> witne&s;&s;eth. But becau&s;e no man of all the ancient writers, hath better de&s;cribed this countrie than <HI>Pomponius Me|la,</HI> let vs heere him &s;peake: It is, &s;aith he, a countrie that cannot much bragge either of the goodne&s;&s;e of their &s;oile, or whole&s;omene&s;&s;e of their aire: nay indeed, except it be in &s;ome place neere the &s;ea coa&s;t, it is barren, cold, and verie vnkinde to all things generally that are &s;et, &s;owne, or laid into the &s;ame. It &s;eldome beareth any apple-trees or other fruit-trees: yet vines do heere and there grow in diuers places: but the grapes neuer ripen kindly, or come to any perfection, except in &s;ome places where the vine-dre&s;&s;ers do, by the leaues, keepe the cold from them. It is a countrey much more kinde to men: yet they are none of the propere&s;t: for they are very clowni&s;h, vnhand&s;ome and rough hewed fellowes: but otherwi&s;e for number and hardine&s;&s;e (for they are many and tho&s;e very vn|ciuill) this nation farre &s;urpa&s;&s;eth others neere adioining. This latter al&s;o is auerred by <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> who affirmeth it to containe &s;uch wonderfull multitudes of men, that, if you &s;hall except <HI>France (Gallia)</HI> it may for ought that I know, in all likely-hood, for multitude of men be preferred before any countrie in the world. <HI>Item, Herodotus</HI> &s;aith, that next after the Indies, it is the greate&s;t countrey of the whole earth. <HI>Liuy</HI> calleth it a de&s;perate and mo&s;t fierce Nation: and <HI>Solinus</HI> he &s;aith, that they are a verie &s;tout and hardy people: <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> maketh them the mo&s;t cruell and furious people that euer he &s;aw or heard of: which <HI>Florus</HI> well expre&s;&s;eth by this example, when he writeth that certaine of them being taken by the Romanes, and giued as the manner of captii&s;es is, did bite the fetters and manacles with their teeth, and &s;o them&s;elues to haue &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed their owne barbarous cruelty: and that there are of their parents euen from their cradle trained vp to this wild inhumane kinde of life, <HI>Sidonius</HI> doth teach vs in the&s;e words: <HI>Excipit hic natos glacies, &amp; matris ab aluo Artus infantum molles nix cimbrica durat. Pectore vixaliter qui&s;quam, &s;ed ab vbere tractus. Plus potat per vulnus equum, &s;ic lacte relicto, Virtutem gens tota bibit. Creuere parumper, Mox pugnam ludunt iaculis: hos &s;uggerit illis. Nutrix plaga iocos: pueri venatibus apti, Lu&s;tra feris vacuant. rapto ditata iuuentus, Iura colit gladij. con&s;ummat&aacute;mque &s;enectam Non ferro finire pudet. Tali ordine vitae Ciues Martis agunt.</HI> So &s;oone as infant heere is borne, The thing they &s;ay is &s;ure, To fro&s;t and &s;now their tender limmes They pre&s;ently inure. Scarce one of ma|ny thou&s;ands heere, Doth &s;ucke the Nurces teate: Warme blood of warlike hor&s;es heere, For mo&s;t part's infants meat: This diet mak'th them bold and hard. And as they come to growth They learne to to&s;&s;e the speare and pike: Heere no man liueth in &s;lowth. The&s;e are the &s;ports that the&s;e men v&s;e: As &s;oone as boies can ride The fallow deere they learne to cha&s;e: &amp;c. But to the&s;e let vs adde that commendation of them, giuen by the Emperour <HI>Iu&s;tinian</HI> in his <HI>Authentica:</HI> That is mo&s;t certaine, &s;aith he, and for a truth confe&s;&s;ed of all men, That if any one do but name the countrie of <HI>Thracia,</HI> by and by together as &s;oone as the word is out of his mouth, there pre&s;ently entreth into the heart of the &s;tander by, a conceit of manhood and warlike valour fit for all manner of &s;er|uice in the field. For the&s;e things naturally bred in the bone, and as it were proper qualities peculiar to this country onely. <HI>Valerius Maximus</HI> highly commen|deth the valorous wi&s;edome <HI>(Animo&s;am &s;apientiam)</HI> of the Thracians. Yet <HI>Thucydides</HI> &s;aith it was &s;uch, as it was the next doore to barbarous crueltie: where&s;oeuer the Thracian is &s;ecure and thinketh he may &s;afely in&s;ult, there he is mo&s;t bloudy and tyrannous. When it thundereth and lightneth, they &s;hoote their arrowes vp into the aire, threatning euen God him&s;elfe, for that indeed they thinke there is no other God but that whom they adore. The&s;e gods, as <HI>He|rodotus</HI> writeth. <HI>Mars, Bacchus, Diana</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> they wor&s;hip onely and none other. Yet the &s;ame authour in another place nameth <HI>Pli&s;torius,</HI> for a God proper vnto this nation onely. <HI>Ammianus</HI> al&s;o writeth that the&s;e people do wor&s;hip the goodde&s;&s;e <HI>Bellona.</HI> To the&s;e their gods, as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> affirmeth, they &s;lew and &s;acrificed men, before they &s;et forward and attempted to daren battell. In which they v&s;ed, by the report of <HI>Liuy,</HI> two hand &s;words of an huge length. Their &s;alades or head peeces were of woolues skins, euery man wearing his dart, and his target with a &s;hort dagger or poinyard. Euery man heere thinketh it a gallant thing and very honourable to liue by the warres, and by robbing and &s;poiling. An idle fellow heere is accounted for a right honest man: and it is a mo&s;t ba&s;e and contemptible thing to be an hu&s;bandman. <HI>Clemens</HI> in the &s;euenth booke of his <HI>Stromaton</HI> writeth, that the&s;e people are of complexion and colour lion tawney, and wanne, or as it were of a skie colour. <HI>Homer</HI> calleth them <HI>Comatos Thraces,</HI> Long-locked Thracians: <HI>Iulius Pollux, In vertice crinitos,</HI> wearing a long-locke vpon the crowne of the head. It was accounted for an honourable thing amongst them to haue their faces full of skarres: and in|deed <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;aith, that it was no di&s;grace to any man. Yea and <HI>Plutarch</HI> addeth that they v&s;ed to imprinte markes vpon their wiues faces: which <HI>Athe|naeus</HI> in the twelfth booke of his <HI>Deipno&s;ophi&s;ton</HI> iu&s;tifieth to be true. <HI>Heraclides</HI> and <HI>Sextus Empiricus</HI> do iointly affirme, that euery man v&s;ually had more wiues than one. It is very certaine, that they were great drinkers of wine and &s;ound drunkerds, and that they brewed their wine with hony, we learne out of <HI>Pliny.</HI> Yet in <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI> I read that diuer&s;e of them did neuer know what wine meant; but when they meant to be merrie, &s;itting round about the hearth, certaine &s;eedes were &s;trawen vpon the coales, which ca&s;t vp &s;uch a &s;moake or &s;teame, that it made euery man &s;o light-headed and plea&s;ant, as if he had beene cup &s;hot, or had taken a pot or two too much of &s;tronge&s;t beere or wine that might be drunke. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> al&s;o writeth that they had heere a kinde of drinke which they called <HI>Brytum,</HI> made of barly and other kinds of corne. <HI>Suidas</HI> writeth, that what wine &s;oeuer the pot-companions, in their quaffings and carow&s;ings could not drinke out was pre&s;ently powred vpon their heads. The &s;ame authour reporteth, that they are much delighted to eate garleeke, as being indeeed of it &s;elfe very hot, and their country wherein they dwell very bleake and cold. <HI>Iulius Pollux</HI> writeth, that they v&s;ed to exchange &s;laues for &s;alt. Whereupon <HI>Sale empti,</HI> bought with &s;alt, was &s;poken prouerbially of bad &s;eruants and &s;uch as were taken vp at iade-faire. <HI>Item,</HI> he affirmeth, that this nation fir&s;t inuen|ted a kinde of mu&s;icall in&s;trument called <HI>Canthorum.</HI> But of the manners and behauiour of this people, many other things may be ob&s;erued in the reading of tho&s;e authours which before I haue cited, e&s;pecially in <HI>Herodotus, Athenaeus, Solinus, Pomponius Mela,</HI> and <HI>Heraclides</HI> his Policies. The&s;e, although meere Barbarians and vnlearned, yet in this one thing, diuer&s;e of them iudged not ami&s;&s;e, in that they thought and verily beleeued the &s;oule to be immortall: others did thinke that it did die, yet &s;o as that it was in better e&s;tate then when it liued. Heereupon it is, that they morned when women were brought in bed, and wept at the birth of their children. An ancient writer affirmeth, that there was a kind of nation of the Thracians that could not reckon further then the number of foure, any greater number they could not remember. Now it remaineth that we &s;hould, out of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> &s;ay &s;omething of the miracles, and &s;trange things found and ob&s;erued in this countrie. In <HI>Chalcidis,</HI> a prouince heere, there is a place called <HI>Cantharoletron;</HI> for that any bea&s;t that goeth in thither, may come &s;afe and &s;ound out againe: &s;aue only the bea&s;t called <HI>Cantharus:</HI> the&s;e neuer come out from thence aliue, but they pre&s;ently fall a turning

<PB REF="299"> round vntill they die. In this countrie is the riuer <HI>Cochryna,</HI> of who&s;e water if any &s;heepe do drinke, they bring foorth none but blacke lambes. Between <HI>By|zantium (Con&s;tantinople)</HI> and the Cher&s;one&s;us, there is an hill which they call <HI>The holy mount,</HI> neere to which, the &s;ea oftentimes carieth vpon the top of his waters a kinde of &s;limy &s;ub&s;tance called of the Latines, <HI>Bitumen.</HI> In <HI>Agria,</HI> a &s;hire of this country, the riuer <HI>Pontus,</HI> carieth downe in his channell cer|taine &s;tones much like vnto coales: which being kindled, and water ca&s;t vpon them, they burne the better: but being blowne with bellowes, they go quite out. There is no manner of vermine or venemous creatures that can abide the &s;mell of this kinde of &s;iring. Amongst the <HI>Cinchrop&s;o&s;es</HI> there is a fountaine, of who&s;e water, who&s;oeuer &s;hall drinke they die immediately. In <HI>Botiaea,</HI> there groweth a &s;tone, which by the heat or reuerberation of the Sunne beames kindleth, and ca&s;teth foorth &s;parks and flames of fire. <HI>Plutarch</HI> writeth, that there is a &s;pring not farre from the hill <HI>Pangaeus,</HI> of who&s;e waters if one fill one and the &s;ame ve&s;&s;ell, and then weight it, he &s;hall finde it to be twi&s;e &s;o heauy in the winter, as it was in the &s;ummer. <HI>Plutarch</HI> (whom <HI>Tzetzes</HI> calleth, The yonger: another nameth him <HI>Parthenicus</HI>) reporteth certaine things of the herbe <HI>Cythara,</HI> the &s;tones <HI>Pan&s;ilypus</HI> and <HI>Philadelphi,</HI> found in the riuers <HI>Ebrus</HI> and <HI>Strymon:</HI> which, becau&s;e they are more like to fables, than true &s;tories, I do in this place willingly omit. To reckon vp heere the &s;euerall Nations, Moun|taines, Riuers or Cities of this country, I thinke it nothing nece&s;&s;ary: becau&s;e they are at one view better to be &s;eene in the Mappe it &s;elfe. Yet of the city <HI>By|zantium</HI> (now <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>) for that it is &s;ooft mentioned in ancient hi&s;tories, to &s;ay nothing at all, for that we do in &s;ome &s;ort hold it an iniury, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to write the&s;e few lines following, of the de&s;cription of it. The fir&s;t founder of <HI>BYZANTIVM,</HI> which was al&s;o in times pa&s;t called <HI>LYGOS,</HI> was, as <HI>Trogus</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> do thinke, one <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> a Captaine of the Spartanes: and that, as <HI>Ca&s;&s;iodorus</HI> writeth, at &s;uch time as <HI>Numa Pompilius</HI> was king of the Romanes. It was &s;o called of <HI>Byzantes,</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Ceroe&s;&s;as,</HI> a captaine of the Megareans: whom <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> affirmeth, to haue beene the vp|righte&s;t and mo&s;t iu&s;t man that euer the earth did beare. This city is &s;ituate vpon an high cliffe, at the narrowe&s;t place of <HI>Bo&s;phorus, Thracius</HI> (the frith or &s;treights of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>) in a very fertile &s;oile, and vpon a fruitfull and commodious &s;ea <HI>(fertili &s;olo &amp; foecundo &s;alo)</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> writeth. In re&s;pect of which &s;ituation, being &s;trongly fortified by nature, it is thought to be almo&s;t inuincible. Whereupon <HI>Trebellius Pollio</HI> calleth it <HI>clau&s;trum Ponticum,</HI> The blocke-hou&s;e of <HI>Pontus. Oro&s;ius</HI> termeth it, <HI>Principem gentium,</HI> the &s;oueraigne of all Nations; <HI>Sextus Rufus, Arcem &s;ecundam Romani orbis,</HI> The &s;econd bulwarke or fortre&s;&s;e of the Romane Empire: <HI>Procopius, Arcem Europae &amp; A&s;iae obicem ponentem,</HI> The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Europe,</HI> and barre against <HI>A&s;ia: Themi&s;tocles Euphrada, Magnificentiae officinam,</HI> The &s;hop of all manner of brauery and courtlike fa&s;hions: and <HI>Ouid</HI> he calleth it, <HI>Va&s;tam gemini maris ianuam,</HI> The huge gate of the two &s;eas, to wit, <HI>Propontis (Mar di marmora)</HI> and <HI>Pontus Euxinus (Mar maiore.)</HI> For the rampart and wals of it (which <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> and both the <HI>Dions</HI> &s;o highly commend) were &s;o &s;trong that the Athenians v&s;ed in former times, as the &s;ame <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> writeth, to cary all their goods and trea&s;ure thither and there to be&s;tow it, holding it to be a place impregnable and not to be &s;urprized by any enemy what&s;oeuer. Of the great felicity of this city you may read many things worth the ob&s;eruation in diuer&s;e ancient writers; e&s;pecially in <HI>Polybius, Herodian, Xiphiline, Dion Pru&s;ens,</HI> and <HI>Themi&s;tocles Euphrada</HI> in his &s;ixth oration: who deemeth the citizens thereof to be mo&s;t happie men, both for the goodly riuer which pa&s;&s;eth by it, temperature of the aire, fertility of the &s;oile wherein it &s;tandeth, capacious hauen and creeke of the &s;ea, gorgeous church and &s;tately wals of the &s;ame. Heerupon grew that daintine&s;&s;e, luxury, drunkenne&s;&s;e and wantonne&s;&s;e of the&s;e people: which vices of theirs are noted by <HI>Athenaeus</HI> in the tenth booke of his <HI>Deipno&s;ophi&s;ton:</HI> and <HI>Aelianus</HI> in the foureteenth chapter of the third booke of his <HI>varia hi&s;toria.</HI> This city, fortune often frowning vpon it, was &s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Spartans or Lacedemonians: after that it was vnder the command of the Athenians. Then &s;haking off their yoke, it began by a little and a little to chalenge vnto it &s;elfe a kinde of &s;oueraignty and freedome from any forren iuri&s;diction: which it held for a while, vntill <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> the Romane Emperour, &s;ubdued it, and reduced it vnto the forme of a prouince. While it thus &s;toode vnder the command of the Romanes, it was, by <HI>Septimius Seuerus,</HI> who held on <HI>Nigers</HI> &s;ide, a&s;&s;aulted, battered, raced to the ground, and of a goodly flouri&s;hing city, made a poore and beggerly village, and withall was adiudged to belong vn|to the <HI>Perinthij.</HI> But <HI>Antonius Caracalla, Seuerus</HI> his &s;onne, re&s;tored them to their ancient liberties, and was called by the name of <HI>ANTONIA,</HI> as <HI>Eu|&s;tathius</HI> te&s;tifieth. Yet for <HI>Antonia</HI> (that I may note this by the way) an ancient bra&s;&s;e coine, of the Emperour <HI>Seuerus</HI> which I haue, doth teach vs that it ought to be read <HI>Antoninia.</HI> For vpon this peece of money was &s;tamped <HI>&Agr;&Ngr;&Tgr;&Ogr;&Ngr;&Egr;&Igr;&Ngr;&Igr;&Agr; &Bgr;&Ugr;&Zgr;&Agr;&Ngr;&Tgr;&Igr;&OHgr;&Ngr; &Sgr;&Egr;&Bgr;&Agr;&Sgr;&Tgr;&Agr;,</HI> that is, <HI>An|toninia the Emperiall city of the Bizantini.</HI> But after this it was againe wa&s;ted by <HI>Gallienus</HI> the Emperour, and all the citizens and garri&s;on &s;ouldiers thereof &s;laine and put to the &s;word. Yet for feare lea&s;t the Scythians, Getes and other barbarous nations might breake in to the Romane territories on that &s;ide, it was againe reedified, repaired and fortified by the &s;ame Emperour. But <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> worthily in deed and name &s;urnamed the Great, did yet farre more &s;trongly fortifie it: and adorne it with the mo&s;t goodly temple of <HI>Santa Sophia:</HI> and moreouer gracing it with many &s;tately ornaments and curious workes of Architecture which he cau&s;ed to be brought out of <HI>A&s;ia, Africa, Europe,</HI> yea and from <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elfe, and after his owne name by proclamation cau&s;ed it to be intituled and called by the name of <HI>CONSTANTINOPOLIS,</HI> that is, Con&s;tantines city. <HI>Item,</HI> he tooke it from the <HI>Perinthij,</HI> made it a free cor|poration and endowed it with many large and ample priuiledges. After him, as <HI>Themi&s;tius Euphrada</HI> in his &s;ixth oration te&s;tifieth, <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the Great did beautifie it with diuer&s;e gorgeous and costly buildings. Moreouer <HI>Iu&s;tinian</HI> the Emperour, as <HI>Procopius</HI> an eie-witne&s;&s;e affirmeth, adorned it with ma|ny mo&s;t faire and beautifull workes of curious Architecture. But e&s;pecially he graced it by that glorious worke of that &s;tately temple of <HI>Santa Sophia,</HI> which he repaired (being a little before burnt downe, and vtterly defaced by fire) and of it be&s;towed &s;uch co&s;t, that the Emperour him&s;elfe, as <HI>Glycas</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, bold|ly &s;aid that in this edifice he had exceeded euen glorious king <HI>Salomon,</HI> in that his building. Which worke of his, as <HI>P. Diaconus</HI> writeth of it, did &s;o much excell all other buildings, that in the whole world be&s;ide there was not to be found another that might in any re&s;pect be compared vnto it. Whereupon <HI>Corippus</HI> thus &s;peak th of this Church: <HI>Iam Solomoniaci &s;ileat de&s;criptio templi, Cedant cunctorum miracula nota locorum.</HI> That &s;tately worke of <HI>Salomon,</HI> great <HI>Iudahs</HI> glorious king, May now be &s;till and bragge no more: The greate&s;t woonders of the world, may well giue place to this, No eie hath &s;eene the like be|fore. <HI>Con&s;ta. Mana&s;&s;es</HI> calleth it <HI>Orbis ornamentum,</HI> The glorie of the world, which he verily beleeueth the very Seraphim them&s;elues did reuerence and adore. But if any one be de&s;irous to know the fa&s;hion and modell of this building, let him haue recour&s;e to <HI>Procopius</HI> his fir&s;t booke of <HI>Edifices.</HI> Of this church <HI>Paulus Lyrus Florus</HI> wrote a treati&s;e in heroike or hexameter ver&s;e, as <HI>Agathias</HI> in his fifth booke te&s;tifieth. So that it might &s;eeme that there was nothing more that might be wi&s;hed for the further beautifying of this city. <HI>Sozomen</HI> doubted not boldly to affirme, That <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> both for multitude of men, and &s;tore of wealth and money, by all mens ioint con&s;ent, did farre excell euen great <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elfe. Moreouer <HI>Nazianzen</HI> writeth, That <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> for beauty and brauerie, did as much excell all other cities of the world be&s;ide, as the highe&s;t heauens in glory do exceed the lowe&s;t elements. Whereupon of &s;ome it was graced with the&s;e proud titles, <HI>VRBS AETERNAE, VRBS REGIA, NOVA &amp; SECVNDA ROMA, The eternall City, The Emperi|all City; New</HI> Rome, and <HI>Another</HI> Rome. In the prai&s;ing and tax of the chiefe cities of the Romane Empire, this city, in a Councell there held, was placed in the &s;econd degree: but in former times, as <HI>Ege&s;ippus</HI> te&s;tifieth, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the third place. <HI>Zo&s;imus</HI> writeth, that there is no other city what&s;oeuer, whe|ther you re&s;pect the large compa&s;&s;e and circuite of the wals, or great felicity of it euery way, that may iu&s;tly be compared vnto it. The buildings of it are &s;o clo&s;e and neere together and the hou&s;es and &s;treets are &s;o pe&s;tered and thronged, that whether a man keepe home or walke abroad he &s;hall be &s;o crowded and thru&s;t, that &s;carcely he might go without danger, by rea&s;on of the huge throng of men and infinite of multitude of cattle alwaies pa&s;&s;ing to and fro in the &s;ame. He that de&s;ireth to know all the glorious ornaments and woonderfull things worthy of ob&s;eruation to be &s;eene in this city, let him read <HI>George Cedren</HI> his hi&s;torie of the life of <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the Great. Where he doth not onelie receite them all and reckon them vp curiou&s;ly, but al&s;o he doth mo&s;t artificially de&s;cribe them and paint them out in their true colours. This city was taken, in the yeere of Chri&s;t <HI>1453.</HI> by Mahomet the fir&s;t of that name, Emperour of the Turkes, who at this daie do yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it. Manie other things pertaining to the beautie and magnificence of this city are to be &s;eene in the booke of Records of both the Empires, and in <HI>Procopius</HI> his fir&s;t booke <HI>De Aedificijs.</HI> Of the originall and famous buildings of this city, read <HI>George Codinus:</HI> for no man hath handled that argument better than he. But of the later writers, <HI>Petrus Gyllius</HI> hath mo&s;t exactly and learnedly de&s;cribed the &s;ame. Of the Thracians, this one thing in this place I cannot omit; namely, That in former times they bore a great &s;way in forren countries, and were great Lords out of their owne natiue &s;oile. For they conquered and had vnder them a great part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which is &s;ituate ouer again&s;t them, and cau&s;ed it after their name to be called <HI>THRACIA ASIATICA:</HI> yea and toward the South, beyond the bounds of their owne country, vpon the Aegean &s;ea (where <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> de&s;cribed <HI>THRACIA CARIA</HI>) they had long &s;ince placed their colonies. This prouince, <HI>Porphyrogenneta</HI> calleth <HI>THRACESIVM. Xenophon</HI> doubted not to call this kingdome the greate&s;t of all other between the Ionian &s;ea and <HI>Pontus Euxinus.</HI> Moreouer <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh mention, of a certaine nation, dwelling aboue <HI>Armenia,</HI> which were called <HI>Thra|ces Seraperae.</HI> To this <HI>Thracia,</HI> is annexed a <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us</HI> or Neckland, which thereupon was &s;irnamed <HI>THRACIA CHERSONESVS. Suidas</HI> cal|leth it <HI>CHERSONESVS HELEESPONTIACA,</HI> of the &s;ea <HI>Helle&s;pontus,</HI> neere neighbour vnto it. It is al&s;o named <HI>PALLENE</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;eus</HI> and <HI>Stephanus,</HI> who moreouer addeth, that it was inhabited of the <HI>Cru&s;aei. Xenophon</HI> &s;aith, it was a mo&s;t rich &s;oile, and fertile of all manner of things what|&s;oeuer: and withall affirmeth that in it were eleuen or twelue great and goodly townes. But wee out of all ancient Hi&s;torians haue much exceeded this number, as the Mappe doth &s;ufficiently approue. This Neckland or <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us</HI> belonged &s;ometime to <HI>Marcus Agrippa,</HI> after who&s;e decea&s;e, as <HI>Dion</HI> reporteth, it fell vnto <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar.</HI> He that de&s;ireth out of ancient writers, a more ample de&s;cription of <HI>Thracia,</HI> let him read <HI>Wolfangus Lazius</HI> his Hi&s;tories of <HI>Greece: Item,</HI> the fifth booke of <HI>Agathias</HI> a Grecian borne.

<HEAD>GRAECIA, OR HELLAS.</HEAD>
<P>_THat country which the Latines call GRAECIA, <HI>Greece,</HI> of the Greekes them&s;elues general|ly was named HELLAS: yet the out-borders of it are not the &s;ame, according to euery mans de&s;cription and limitation. That was truly and mo&s;t anciently called <HI>Greece,</HI> which <HI>Ptolemey, Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela,</HI> name ACHAIA; in which <HI>Athens,</HI> the fir&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Vniuer&s;ity of the World, and mo&s;t renowmed citie of the&s;e parts was &s;eated. Heere <HI>Iupi|ter</HI> him&s;elfe, as <HI>Athenaeus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, kept his Court. It is a free city, as <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it, and needeth as he &s;aith, no further commendations, &s;o famous and honourable it is, and euer hath been beyond all mea&s;ure or conceipt of man. Yet it is manife&s;t, not only out of the writers of the common &s;ort of Hi&s;toriographers, but al&s;o euen out of <HI>Strabo</HI> him&s;elfe, the prince of Geogra|phers, that many countries are comprehended vnder the name of <HI>Graecia</HI> or <HI>Hellas,</HI> as namely, <HI>Macedonia, Epirus, Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and tho&s;e other prouinces and &s;hires, conteined vnder the&s;e names: &s;o that all <HI>Greece,</HI> as it is gene|rally taken, is on three &s;ides bounded with the <HI>Ionian, Aegean (Archipelago)</HI> and the <HI>Libyan</HI> &s;eas: toward the maine land it abutteth vpon tho&s;e mountaines which do part <HI>Macedonia</HI> from <HI>Thracia, (Romania) My&s;ia</HI> the vpper, (<HI>Ser|uia, Bo&s;na</HI> and <HI>Bulgaria,</HI>) and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> (now it is called <HI>Sclauonia.</HI>) This is that <HI>Greece,</HI> which, as <HI>Manilius</HI> &s;aith, is <HI>Maxima terra viris, &amp; foecundi&s;sima doctis Vrbibus,</HI> &amp;c. Renowmed <HI>Greece,</HI> for warlike men, and &s;chollers deeply learned, doth farre excell&mdash; &amp;c. which, (as <HI>Cicero</HI> writeth in his oration <HI>pro Flacco) for honour, renowme, learning, diuers arts and &s;ciences, ciuill policy in time of peace, and feates of armes and martiall chiualrie abroad, hath euer been famous:</HI> or, as <HI>Tro|gus Pompeius</HI> in his 8. booke &s;aith, was for valour and e&s;timation, <HI>Prince&s;&s;e of the World.</HI> From hence, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, the bright lu&s;ture of all maner of literature and humane learning, fir&s;t call forth his beames, and enlightned the re&s;t of the world on all &s;ides round about.</P>
<P>In this country humanity and letters together with the maner to write and read, how to till the ground and &s;ow corne, was fir&s;t inuented and practi&s;ed, as <HI>Plinius Caecilius</HI> hath left recorded in his epi&s;tle written to his friend <HI>Maximus:</HI> And this is that country, &s;aith he, from whom we had our &s;tatutes: that I meane, which receiued not lawes, as tho&s;e do which are at the command of the conquerour, but willingly and curteou&s;ly did communi|cate them, to &s;uch as did demand them. MACEDONIA, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the greate&s;t part of <HI>Greece.</HI> This long &s;ince hauing conquered the greate&s;t part of the World, pa&s;sing through <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the Le&s;&s;e, <HI>Armenia, Iberia, Albania, Cappa|docia, Syria, Aegypt,</HI> the mountaines <HI>Taurus</HI> and <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> &s;ubdued <HI>Bactria, Media, Per&s;ia</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e Ea&s;tern countries, euen as farre as <HI>India;</HI> (in this following the &s;teps of <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Hercules</HI>) of which al&s;o it became the Empre&s;&s;e, yea thou mai&s;t &s;ay, if thou wilt, of the whole world, an&s;weareable to that of <HI>Manilius, &mdash; &amp; Macedum tellus quae vicerat Orbem:</HI> &mdash; and <HI>Macedonia</HI> &s;tout which all the world &s;ubdued.

But that the name of <HI>Greece</HI> did extend it &s;elfe further than before &s;pecified, on ech &s;ide of the &s;ea, it plainly appeareth out of the records of the be&s;t writers: for how great a portion of <HI>Italy</HI> was in old time called <HI>Magna Graecia,</HI> Great <HI>Greece?</HI> A great part al&s;o of the maine continent in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> beyond the &s;ea ouer again&s;t <HI>Macedonia,</HI> of certaine colonies tran&s;ported thither and &s;eated there by the Greekes, was named al&s;o by this name: who&s;e inhabitants, <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his <HI>Laconica apothegma|ta,</HI> for di&s;tinction &s;ake, nameth <HI>Graecos A&s;ianos,</HI> A&s;ian Greekes.

<P>_THat this iland was &s;ometimes a part of <HI>Syria</HI> and ioyned to the maine land, <HI>Pliny</HI> in his Naturall history doth affirme: and that it &s;hall againe be reunited to the &s;ame, <HI>Apollo</HI> hath prophe&s;ied, as <HI>Strabo</HI> in his Geographie hath left recorded. Amongst tho&s;e ilands of the Midland &s;ea more noted for their greatne&s;&s;e, this doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the &s;ixth place. In re&s;pect of the forme, it is, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> writeth, compared to a &s;heeps skin: or, as <HI>Hyginus</HI> noteth, to a French target. It is longer one way than another, by the iudgement of <HI>Strabo;</HI> who moreouer addeth, that for excellency and goodne&s;&s;e of &s;oile, it is inferiour vnto no iland what&s;oeuer. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> do te&s;tifie, hat in former times nine kings did reigne in it at once. <HI>Herodotus</HI> &s;ayth, that king <HI>Ama&s;is</HI> was of all mortall men the fir&s;t that tooke it, and made it tributary vnto his crowne. It was all ouer &s;omtime &s;o woody and ouergrowen with bu&s;hes and trees, that the ground by no meanes might be ploughed and manured: a great part of which although it was dayly &s;pent in the melting, and refining of copper and &s;iluer, (for the iland is very full of mettals) as al&s;o for the building of &s;hips; yet notwith&s;tanding for all this they neuer were able vtterly to de&s;troy their huge woods and infinite luxuriou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the &s;ame, vntill by proclamation free liberty and licence was giuen and granted to euery man that li&s;t, to fell and cary away what wood and timber they plea&s;ed: Item, that what ground &s;o euer any man had cleared by &s;tocking vp the bu&s;hes and trees, that he &s;hould for euer after hold for his owne by a free tenure. The woonderfull fertilitie of this &s;oile <HI>Elianus</HI> doth be|wray, when as he writeth, that &s;tagges and hindes do oft times &s;wim hither out of <HI>Syria</HI> to fill their bellies: &s;o good is the feed of this ile. The manifold variety and plen|ty of all &s;orts of commodities here, tho&s;e words of <HI>Ammian</HI> in his <HI>14</HI> booke do &s;ufficiently demon&s;trate vnto vs: when he giueth out, That it needeth no maner of forren helpe of other countries, only of it &s;elfe it is able to build a &s;hippe euen from the very keele to the top &s;aile, to rigge it and &s;end it foorth to &s;ea furni&s;hed with all maner of nece&s;&s;aries what&s;oeuer. The great riches of this iland, the&s;e words of <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> do manife&s;tly declare: <HI>CYPRVS famous for great wealth, moued the begger|ly Romans to attempt the &s;ame; &s;o that indeed the intere&s;t that we haue in that iland, we gat rather by violence, than any right we had vnto it. Florus</HI> writeth, That the riches of this iland when it was once wholly &s;ubdued did fill the Exchequer of the city of <HI>Rome</HI> more full, than any other conque&s;t that euer they got where&s;oeuer. <HI>Cary&s;tius lapis, (Cari&s;tium,</HI> I thinke a kinde of greene marble) a &s;tone of great e&s;timation is found here, as <HI>Antigonus</HI> writeth: and as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifi|eth, the Diamond, Smaragd, Opalus, Cry&s;tall, Alume, and a kinde of whet&s;tone, which they call <HI>Naxium.</HI> The &s;ame authour affirmeth, that the Ro&s;en of this iland doth far &s;urpa&s;&s;e that of any other places of the whole world. He al&s;o highly commendeth the oiles and vnguents of the &s;ame for plea&s;ure and delight, as al&s;o their wax and reeds as much for medicines and nece&s;&s;ary v&s;e in phy&s;icke. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> extolleth their pa&s;&s;ing faire doues. Fabulous antiquity did verily beleeue that the godde&s;&s;e <HI>Venus</HI> here fir&s;t came vp out of the &s;ea: for who&s;e honour and memory peraduenture, the women of <HI>Cyprus</HI> (as the &s;ame authour affirmeth) do offer their bodies to be abu&s;ed of euery man that li&s;t. Why it was not lawfull for any Iew to come within the ile of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> reade <HI>Dion</HI> in the hi&s;tory of <HI>Hadrian.</HI> The diuers names of this iland as we haue noted out of &s;undry authours are the&s;e: <HI>ACAMANTIS, AEROSA, AMATHVSA, ASPELIA, CERASTIS, CITIDA, COLINIA, CRYPTVS, MACARIA, MEIONIS,</HI> and <HI>SPHECIA:</HI> of which &s;ee more particularly in our Geographicall trea&s;ury. Of the Cyprians, or people of this i|land, thou mai&s;t reade many things in <HI>Herodotus.</HI> There are al&s;o other three Cyprianiles, called by this name, about this iland, as <HI>Pliny</HI> teacheth.</P>

<P>THis iland is &s;euered by &s;o &s;mall a frith, (thus <HI>Solinus</HI> de&s;cribeth it) from the maine land of <HI>Boeotia,</HI> that it is hard to &s;ay whether it be to be accounted amongst the number of the ilands or not: (Thus &s;ome haue thought of the <HI>Ile of Wight:</HI>) For on that &s;ide, which they call <HI>Euripus,</HI> it is ioined to the continent by a faire bridge, and by the meanes of a very &s;hort &s;caffold one may pa&s;&s;e from the firme lana thither on foot: and, as <HI>Procopius</HI> in his <HI>iiij. Aedifi.</HI> te&s;tifieth, by the laying ouer, or taking away of one rafter or planke, one may go from one to another on foot or by boat as one plea&s;e. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth that it was &s;ometime ioined to <HI>Boeotia,</HI> but was afterward &s;euered from it by an earth-quake: and indeed the whole iland is much &s;ubiect to earth-quakes, but e&s;pecially that frith or <HI>Euripus</HI> which we mentioned a little aboue, as <HI>Strabo</HI> telleth vs; who moreouer addeth that by that meanes a faire citie, of the &s;ame name with the ile, was vtterly &s;unke and &s;wallowed vp of the &s;ea. Of all the ilands of the Midland &s;ea this in bigne&s;&s;e is held to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the fifth place. In diuers authours it is called by diuers and &s;undry names: as <HI>MACRA,</HI> and <HI>MACRIS, ABANTIAS, ASOPIS, OCHE, ELLOPIA, ARCHIBIVM, &amp;c.</HI> Item, <HI>CHALCIS,</HI> of the chiefe and metropolitan city of the &s;ame, &s;ituate vpon the forenamed frith. This, I &s;ay, was the greate&s;t city and metropolitan of all the whole ile, and was of that power and command, that it &s;ent forth colonies into <HI>Macedony, Italy,</HI> and <HI>Sicilia.</HI> In <HI>Lalantus,</HI> that goodly champion, there are, as <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, certaine hot baths, which <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth <HI>Thermas Ellopias,</HI> The baths of Hellopia. They are very &s;oueraigne again&s;t diuers di&s;ea&s;es. Here are, as <HI>Strabo</HI> reporteth, the riuers <HI>Cireus</HI> and <HI>Nileus,</HI> of which the one cau&s;eth &s;uch &s;heepe as drinke of it to be white, the other blacke. <HI>Pliny</HI> doth al&s;o highly commend a kinde of greene marble here which they call <HI>Cary&s;tium,</HI> for that it is digged out of a rocke nere the towne <HI>Cary&s;tus,</HI> in the Ea&s;t corner of this ile, where al&s;o the marble temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> is de&s;cribed by <HI>Strabo.</HI> Copper was fir&s;t found in this iland: here do growe the woor&s;t firre trees, as <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmeth; item, here bloweth olympias, a winde proper to this countrey: againe, that the fi&s;hes taken in the &s;ea here abouts are &s;o &s;alt, that you would iudge them taken out of pickle. Of the <HI>Euripus</HI> (where they &s;ay <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> abode and died) very &s;trange things are tolde by diuers writers; namely that it doth ordinarily ebbe and flowe &s;euen times in a day, and as many times in the night, and that &s;o violently and high that no windes can preuaile again&s;t it, nay and the talle&s;t &s;hips that are, though vnder &s;aile, it driueth to and fro as it li&s;teth. Of all men, <HI>Strabo</HI> in his tenth booke hath mo&s;t curiou&s;ly de&s;cribed this iland. See al&s;o what <HI>Procopius</HI> in his fourth booke <HI>de Aedificijs Iu&s;tiniani,</HI> &s;aith of it. Item, <HI>Wolfgangus Lazius,</HI> in that his Hi&s;torie of <HI>Greece,</HI> hath &s;et out a very large Commentarie of the &s;ame. <HI>Libanius Sophi&s;ta,</HI> in the life of <HI>Demo&s;thenes,</HI> writeth, that it had &s;ometime two and twentie cities.

<HEAD>RHODVS.</HEAD>
<P>THe braue and franke <HI>RHODVS,</HI> was al&s;o of the ancient called <HI>OPHIVSA, STADIA, TEICHINE, AETHRAEA, CORYMBA, POEESSA, A|TABYRIA,</HI> and <HI>TRINACRIA,</HI> yea and by diuers other names al&s;o, as thou maye&s;t &s;ee in our Geographicall trea&s;urie. <HI>Pliny</HI> giueth out that this ile did ri&s;e vp out of the bottome of the &s;ea, hauing beene before all drowned and couered ouer with water: and <HI>Ammianus</HI> he writeth, that it was &s;ometime bedrenched and &s;ow|&s;ed with a golden &s;howre of raine: for the fabulous writers do tell that heere it rained gold, when <HI>Pallas</HI> was borne. Therefore this &s;oile, aboue all other was beloued of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> the mighty king of gods and men, as the poet &s;aith. In <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> we read that it was beloued of the Sun, and made an iland, by the remouing of the water which before had couered it all ouer: for before this it lay hid in the bowels of the &s;ea, or el&s;e was &s;o full of bogs and fennes that it was altogether inhabitable. In memory of which kindne&s;&s;e of louely <HI>Phoebus,</HI> that huge <HI>Colo&s;&s;us of the Sun,</HI> one of the &s;euen wonders of the world, was vulgarly &s;aid to haue beene erected. This, we read, was made by <HI>Chares Lindius, Ly&s;ippus</HI> his &s;choller, and was at lea&s;t &s;euenty cubites high: <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> &s;aith, that it was one hundred and fiue foot high. This image, &s;aith <HI>Pliny,</HI> within &s;ix and fifty yeeres after, was by an earth-quake ouerthrowen and laid along: notwith&s;tanding, as it lay it was a woonderment to the behol|ders. Few men were able to fathom the thombe of it: and the fingers of it were greater than many large &s;tatues. Tho&s;e parts of it that were by any ca&s;ualty broken did gape &s;o wide, that they were like vnto the mouths of hideous caues: within it were huge ma&s;&s;ie &s;tones of great weight, wherewith he ballaced it when it was fir&s;t &s;et vp. It was fini&s;hed in the &s;pace of twelue yeeres: and the bra&s;&s;e thereof waighed three hundred talents. There are be&s;ide in &s;undrie other places of this city, an hundred le&s;&s; r colo&s;&s;es, yet where&s;oeuer any of them were, they did much grace the place. In another place the &s;ame authour writeth that, that there were in it aboue three thou&s;and &s;tatues. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth, that this <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> in his time, was by an earth-quake ouerthrowne and lay along, and was broken off at the knees: after which time the Rhodians were by the oracle of <HI>Apollo,</HI> forbidden to &s;et it vp againe. Of this Earth-quake read <HI>Polybius</HI> in his fifth booke. <HI>The aire is neuer &s;o thicke and cloudy, nor the heauen euer &s;o clo&s;ely maskt,</HI> &s;aith Solinus Polyhi&s;tor, <HI>but the &s;unne doth &s;hine in Rhodes.</HI> Whereupon Manilius writeth thus of it, <HI>Tuqu&egrave; ver&egrave; domus Solis, cui tota &s;acrataes.</HI> And thou who truly &s;acredart, and princely court of glorious Sunne. <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> do commend the <HI>Wines</HI> and <HI>Figges</HI> of <HI>Rhodes</HI> aboue tho&s;e of other countries. <HI>Phylo&s;tratus</HI> in his &s;econd booke of Images affirmeth, that the &s;oile of this ile is very good and fertile of <HI>Grapes</HI> and <HI>Figges.

Moreouer, they &s;ay, that in the confines of <HI>Gno&s;ia, (Cino&s;a)</HI> neere the riuer <HI>Therene,</HI> the manage of <HI>Iupiter,</HI> with <HI>Iuno</HI> was celebrated and kept. The hi&s;tory of <HI>Minoes</HI> the Law-giuer: and <HI>Radamanthus,</HI> the &s;euere Iu&s;ticier, hath made it more talked of, than any other ile in this ocean. That it is very full of mountaines and woods, and hath al&s;o diuers fertile valleies and champion plaines, <HI>Strabo</HI> doth &s;ufficiently witne&s;&s;e. <HI>Solinus</HI> maketh it to be a country well &s;tored with wild goates. <HI>Item,</HI> he &s;heweth that the &s;heep, e&s;pecially about <HI>Gurtyna</HI>) are red and foure horn'd. <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it, The natiue &s;oile of the Cypre&s;&s;e tree: for which way &s;oeuer any man &s;hall goe, or where&s;oeuer he &s;hall offer to &s;et his foote, e&s;pecially about mount <HI>Ida (P&s;iloriti)</HI> and tho&s;e which they call, The white hils, except the &s;oile be planted with other trees, this tree &s;prowth vp, and that not only in any peculiar or made ground, but euery where of it owne accord naturally. <HI>Cornelius Cel&s;us</HI> &s;peaketh of <HI>Ari&s;tolochia Cretica.</HI> That there is heere no Owle, or any mi&s;chieuous and harmefull creature, be&s;ide the <HI>Phalangium,</HI> a kind of perillous Spider, <HI>Plutarch, Pl ny, Solinus, AElianus</HI> and <HI>Antigonius</HI> do iointly te&s;tifie. <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> in his 30. booke, doth commend the dogges or hounds of this iland for excellent hunters. The&s;e <HI>Iulius Pollux,</HI> in the fifth booke of his <HI>Deipno&s;ophi&s;ton,</HI> diuideth into two kindes, <HI>Parippi,</HI> (light foot and his kinde) and <HI>Diaponi (Toyler,</HI> with her whelpes) that is, The one &s;ort excelled for &s;wift|ne&s;&s;e of foote, the other for painefulne&s;&s;e and &s;ure hunting. <HI>Pau&s;anias, Liuius, Aelian, Xenophon</HI> and <HI>Cte&s;ias</HI> commend the in|habitants and people of this ile for the be&s;t Archers. <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;aith, they are a warlike people and very la&s;ciuious: <HI>item,</HI> deceit|full, rauenous and couetous: <HI>Athenaeus</HI> he affirmeth that they be great wine-bibbers, and cunning dancers: S. <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epi&s;tle to <HI>Titus, chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 9. calleth them, by the te&s;timony of <HI>Epimenides</HI> a poet of their nation, <HI>Alwaies liers, euill bea&s;ts, and &s;low bellies.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding <HI>Plato</HI> in his Lawes writeth, that they more regard the &s;en&s;e and true vnder&s;tanding of mat|ters, than words and quaint termes. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> reporteth that the ile was fir&s;t inhabited of the <HI>Eteocretae,</HI> a people bred and borne there <HI>(indigenae)</HI> who&s;e King he calleth <HI>Creta:</HI> yet this king <HI>Solinus</HI> nameth, the king of the <HI>Curetae,</HI> and from hence the iland was called CRETA. But if we may beleeue <HI>Dociades,</HI> whom <HI>Plinie</HI> citeth, it tooke the name of <HI>Creta,</HI> a nymph &s;o cal|led. It was al&s;o named CVRETIS, of the <HI>Cureti</HI> a chiefe nation which did &s;ometime inhabite it: this doth <HI>Plinie</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> te&s;tifie: <HI>Item,</HI> they affirme that it was before that called AERIA, <HI>Item,</HI> MACAROS, Ble&s;&s;ed; and MACARONNESOS, The ble&s;|&s;ed ile; of the temperature of the aire: <HI>Stephanus</HI> calleth it IDAEA and CTHONIA: <HI>Item,</HI> TELCHIONIA, of the <HI>Telchines</HI> the in|habitants, as <HI>Gyraldus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth: <HI>Item,</HI> HECATOMPOLIS, of the hundred cities, which in former times it had, as <HI>Plinie, So|linus</HI> and <HI>Strabo</HI> out of <HI>Homer</HI> reporteth: who otherwi&s;e &s;aith (which <HI>Plato</HI> iu&s;tifieth) that it had only foure&s;core and tenne. Yet I, in this my mappe, out of the writers in both languages, haue gathered an hundred &s;euerall names of cities, and more: many of which, for that I knew not their &s;ituation and place, I haue &s;et apart by them&s;elues, as certaine other places heere men|tioned by &s;ome authours. Among&s;t the greater iles of the midland &s;ea, this, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> te&s;tifieth, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth the fourth place.

<P>_OF tho&s;e &s;euen ilands of the Midland&s;ea, more famous and memorable than the re&s;t for their greatne&s;&s;e, &s;ome there are, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> writeth which make this the third. They which de&s;cribe countries by their formes and proportions, do liken this to the print of a mans foot: whereupon it was &s;ometime named ICH|NVSA and SANDALIOTIS: of the Greekes it was called, of <HI>Sardon, Hercules</HI> his &s;onne, SARDON; of the Latines, SARDINIA. This, by the te&s;timonie of <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> in his <HI>Phocica,</HI> may be compared to tho&s;e iles which, either for greatne&s;&s;e or goodne&s;&s;e of &s;oile, are mo&s;t highlie commended. <HI>Polybius</HI> &s;aith, That for greatne&s;&s;e, multitude of men, and all manner of excellent fruites, it beareth the bell from other ilands in this &s;ea. <HI>AElianus</HI> calleth it, The be&s;t nurce for cattell: <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh it, The be&s;t &s;oile for corne, where|upon <HI>Florus</HI> termeth it, <HI>Annonae pignus,</HI> a pawne for all maner of proui&s;ion. <HI>Prudentius</HI> writeth, That a nauie, which &s;hould bring ouer into <HI>Italy</HI> the &s;tore of graine in <HI>Sardinia,</HI> would bur&s;t all the barnes of <HI>Rome. Saluianus</HI> nameth this iland, <HI>Vitalem vrbis Romae venam,</HI> the vitall artery, or veine wherein the life bloud of the citie of <HI>Rome</HI> doth con&s;i&s;t. <HI>Sidonius in Pane|gyrico Maiorani,</HI> &s;aith that it is very fertile of &s;iluer. It is an iland verie rich and fertile of &s;iluer, as <HI>Pomponius</HI> writeth: <HI>Item,</HI> hee writeth that the &s;oile is much better than the aire: and as it is verie fruitfull, &s;o is it for the mo&s;t part pe&s;tilent and vnwhole&s;ome: the which <HI>Strabo</HI> al&s;o confirmeth, where he &s;aith, That in &s;ommer time it is verie dangerous for &s;ickene&s;&s;es, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e places where it is mo&s;t fertile. To the&s;e di&s;commodities, the hearb <HI>Sardonia,</HI> al&s;o may be adioined, which, as <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> in the foureteenth chapter of his &s;ixth booke, writeth, that if it be eaten troubleth the braine, taketh away a mans memorie, maketh him yawne, and &s;o to die as if he laughed. There is al&s;o the <HI>Solifuga,</HI> (as <HI>Pliny</HI> calleth it, or <HI>Solipungia,</HI> as <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>) a little creature, much like to the Spider, vpon which, who&s;oeuer &s;hall chance to &s;it, he lightlie &s;halbe dangerou&s;lie hurt. The <HI>Mu&s;mo,</HI> a bea&s;t like to a ramme, which <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith is proper to <HI>Cor&s;ica, Strabo</HI> attributeth to this ile: to whom al&s;o <HI>AElianus</HI> in the foure and thirtith chapter of his &s;ixteenth booke <HI>De Animalibus,</HI> doth &s;eeme to giue his voice. <HI>Suidas</HI> &s;aith that heere are bred the be&s;t and fine&s;t purples. <HI>Nonnius Marcellus,</HI> by the authority of <HI>Varro,</HI> in his booke <HI>De genere ve&s;timentorum,</HI> commendeth the Sar|dinian tape&s;trie (except there be a fault in the copie, and for <HI>Sardineae,</HI> it &s;hould be written <HI>Sardianis,</HI> of <HI>Sardis</HI> the citie of <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> which I do rather thinke to be true and more probable: for of the Sardian tape&s;trie we maie read in <HI>Athenaeus</HI> and others.) <HI>Claudianus</HI> in the later end of his treati&s;e <HI>De bello Gildonico,</HI> doth mo&s;t finely de&s;cribe <HI>Calaris, (Calari,</HI> or <HI>Caglire</HI>) the chiefe city of the &s;ame. <HI>Strabo</HI> maketh the depth of the &s;ea heere to be M. elles.

This iland grew to &s;uch great &s;trength and power, as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> writeth, that it &s;ub|dued many other ilands and cities, and brought them vnder their command: <HI>Item,</HI> that it was &s;o &s;trong in &s;hip|ping, that it alone, in the Per&s;ian warre, did &s;et out and furni&s;h three&s;core &s;hippes.

<P>ITHACA, which was al&s;o in old time called NERITIA, of <HI>Neritus</HI> a mountaine, if I be not deceiued, is now vulgarly of the Italians called <HI>Valle di Compare,</HI> and as <HI>Porcaccius</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Teachi:</HI> of the Turkes, as the learned <HI>Lewnclawe</HI> writeth, <HI>Phiachi.</HI> More|ouer in the 10. booke of <HI>Straboes</HI> Geography, I find that there is heere a city called <HI>Ithaca,</HI> which <HI>Plutarch</HI> in his Greeke Que|&s;tions nameth, <HI>Alalcome,</HI> but <HI>Stephanus, Alcomenae. Athenaeus</HI> writeth, that it hath many hauens, but withall is very mountai|nous, rough and craggie: &s;o that it will not ea&s;ily, without great and infinite labour and toile, yeeld any &s;mall or meane profit, vnto the husbandmen, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> telleth vs. In <HI>Porphyry,</HI> out of the writings of <HI>Artimedorus,</HI> I read that this iland, from <HI>Pa|normus,</HI> an hauen of <HI>Cephalina,</HI> lieth Ea&s;tward, and conteineth in compa&s;&s;e 85. furlongs. It is very narrow, but high. In it is, as the &s;ame authour, with <HI>Homer</HI> doth witne&s;&s;e, a caue of the Nymphs. We read in <HI>Antigonius,</HI> that it breedeth no Hares at all. Except it had been the natiue &s;oile, and country where <HI>Vly&s;&s;es</HI> was borne, there had no mention at all of it remained in a|ny recordes of ancient writers.</P>
<P>LEVCAS or LEVCADIA (now <HI>S. Maura</HI>) although <HI>Pliny</HI> maketh it but a <HI>penin&s;ula</HI> or demy-ile, yet <HI>Mela</HI> calleth it flatly an iland. That it was made an iland and was &s;euered from the maine continent, yet afterward by force and violence of windes ioined to the &s;ame againe, <HI>Strabo</HI> doth teach vs. In a very high foreland or promontory of this ile, <HI>AElianus</HI> de&s;cribeth the temple of <HI>Apollo Aelius,</HI> from whence yearely they were wont to tumble &s;ome one or other downe into the &s;ea headlong, thereby to ap|pea&s;e the wrath and fury of their Gods; as <HI>Strabo</HI> hath left recorded.</P>
<P>ECHINADES, (<HI>Echidnae, Seneca</HI> in his <HI>Troas,</HI> and <HI>Euripides</HI> in <HI>Iphegenia</HI> in <HI>Aulide,</HI> call them: but <HI>Stephanus, Echinae</HI>) &s;o named of the great multitude of the <HI>Echini,</HI> Vrchines or Hedge-hogges, which do greatly infect this iland. <HI>Apollodorus</HI> calleth them, STROPHADES; now they are knowen by the name of the <HI>Cozzulari:</HI> they are, as <HI>Ouid</HI> in the 8. booke of his <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> wri|teth, in number 5. the&s;e were al&s;o part of the continent, as <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> in his <HI>Arcadia,</HI> te&s;tifieth; their forme and fa&s;hion is often altered and changed by the ebbing and flowing (if I may &s;o &s;peake) of the mudde of the riuer <HI>Achelous (A&s;pri</HI> or <HI>Pachicolamo</HI>) at who&s;e mouth they &s;tand, as <HI>Strabo</HI> would faine per&s;wade vs. Neere the&s;e are the <HI>Taphiae</HI> and <HI>Acutae,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Thoae.

<P>_AS that part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> which is inclo&s;ed with <HI>Mar Maiore, Archipelago, Midland &s;ea,</HI> and the riuer <HI>Euphrates,</HI> is of the Geographers properly called <HI>A&s;ia:</HI> &s;o this part of <HI>Africa,</HI> aboue all other prouinces of the &s;ame, hath alwayes hither|to beene knowen by the name of <HI>AFRICA PROPRIA.</HI> This al&s;o is worth the ob&s;eruation, that in all ancient &s;tories, when <HI>A&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Africa</HI> are generally or indefinitly named, the&s;e &s;euerall prouinces of tho&s;e greater parts, are only to be vnder&s;tood. The bounds of this prouince of <HI>Africa</HI> on the We&s;t are the riuer <HI>Amp&s;aga,</HI> and the Mauritania's, the coun|tries of the Moores, their next neighbours: on the North, lieth the Midland &s;ea: <HI>Arae Philenorum,</HI> a village betweene it and <HI>Cyrenaica,</HI> is the vttermo&s;t bound of it Ea&s;tward: the <HI>Inner Libya</HI> and the de&s;erts of the &s;ame do confine it vpon the South. This countrey was otherwi&s;e &s;ometime called <HI>ZEVGIS</HI> and <HI>ZEVGITANA.</HI> It comprehendeth with|in this compa&s;&s;e the&s;e three &s;hires, <HI>NVMIDIA</HI> (named of &s;ome <HI>MASSYLIA) BYZACIVM</HI> and <HI>TRIPOLI|TANA. Diodorus Siculus</HI> diuideth this prouince into foure nations, the <HI>Poeni, Libophoenices, Libyi,</HI> and the <HI>Nu|midae.</HI> At &s;uch time as the Romans bore a &s;way here, and <HI>Scipio Aemilianus</HI> commanded their legions in the&s;e parts, this <HI>Africa</HI> was diuided into two prouinces: that neere <HI>Carthage,</HI> they called <HI>OLDE AFRICA:</HI> that which conteined <HI>Numidia, NEW AFRI|CA,</HI> as <HI>Pliny, Appian</HI> and <HI>Dion</HI> do ioyntly te&s;tifie. <HI>Numidia,</HI> and <HI>Byzacium,</HI> were vnder the command of the Con&s;uls; that wherein <HI>Carthage</HI> &s;tood, belonged to the iuri&s;diction of the Procon&s;uls, as <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> reporteth. (And this diui&s;ion they made, as <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, by a certaine ditch drawen betweene them.) In the fir&s;t booke of <HI>Iu&s;tinians Code,</HI> and in the &s;euen and twentieh title of the &s;ame, thou &s;halt finde another maner of diui&s;ion of this countrey, and a farre other maner of gouernment of it by Pre&s;idents and Lieutenants. <HI>Numidia,</HI> be&s;ide the great &s;tore of Marble there found, called by the name of Numidian marble, and the maruellous plenty of Deere and wilde bea&s;ts which it yeeldeth, hath nothing worth the remembrance, as <HI>Pliny</HI> affirmeth. <HI>Liuy, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> do giue it the prai&s;e for the be&s;t hor&s;men for &s;eruice in the warres, of any countrey what&s;oeuer. They doe as highly commend the fat &s;oile of <HI>Byzacium;</HI> which is &s;uch that it yeeldeth an hundred for one: yea, it hath beene knowen, that one bu&s;hell of wheat being &s;owen, hath yeelded at harue&s;t the increa&s;e of an hundred and fifty bu&s;hels againe. The Lieutenant of this place &s;ent from thence vnto <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome,</HI> forty eares of corne &s;prung and growen vp from one root, and one graine, as was probable. Item there were &s;ent likewi&s;e to <HI>Nero</HI> from thence three hundred and forty &s;talks with eares of corne come vp of one and the &s;ome graine. To this al&s;o may be adioyned the goodne&s;&s;e of the &s;oile, which is &s;uch, as <HI>Columella</HI> reporteth of it, that the hu&s;bandman, after he hath layd his &s;eed in the ground, from &s;eed-time to harue&s;t, neuer looketh to his fields, nor once medleth with it more, for that &s;ear&s;e any weed or other &s;uch thing, which v&s;ually hindereth the growth of corne, doth here come vp of it owne accord, except it be either &s;et or &s;owen by hand. <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;eus</HI> al&s;o maketh mention of this great fertility of <HI>Africa.</HI> But <HI>Titus</HI> the Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> in one word, doth &s;ufficiently declare the woonderfully fruitfulne&s;&s;e and plenty of all things here, in an Oration of his written vnto the &s;editious and mutinous Iewes, where he nameth it, <HI>Altricem orbis terrarum,</HI> The nour&s;e of all nations of the world. Yea and <HI>Saluianus</HI> in his &s;euenth booke ter|meth it, <HI>Animam Reipublicae Romanae,</HI> The &s;oule of the Romane Common-wealth, or politicke body there; where thou may&s;t reade many other things worth the ob&s;eruation, of the riches, command and power of this countrey. <HI>Herodian</HI> maketh it a country very fertile of men. <HI>Polybius</HI> on the other &s;ide doth as much commend it for the great abundance of cattell and all &s;orts of liuing creatures that it breedeth. So that for multitude of Hor&s;es, Oxen, Sheepe, and Goats, it doth farre &s;urpa&s;&s;e almo&s;t all the re&s;t of the world be&s;ide. And that which is mo&s;t woonderfull of all other, it is no &s;trange thing here (as <HI>Columella,</HI> out of <HI>Diony&s;ius, Mago,</HI> and <HI>Marcus Varro,</HI> telleth vs) to &s;ee Mules to breed, and bring forth yoong: &s;o that the inhabitants do as oft &s;ee the foales of Mules there, as we do of Mares here. The &s;ame authour in the fir&s;t chapter of his fourth booke &s;ayth that the people are very ingenious and witty. <HI>Hirtius</HI> calleth it, <HI>Gentem in&s;idio&s;am,</HI> A treacherous nation: <HI>Maternus</HI> nameth it, <HI>Gentem &s;ubdolam,</HI> A wily and crafty people: &s;o that <HI>Vlgetius</HI> doubted not to &s;ay, That for wiles and wealth the Romans were alwayes inferiour to the Africans. <HI>Iuuenal</HI> the Poet termeth it, <HI>Cau&s;idi|corum nut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">iculam,</HI> The nur&s;e of prating petifoggers. <HI>Athenaeus</HI> recounteth the Carthaginians amongst tho&s;e nations which delight much in qua&s;&s;ing and carow&s;ing, and v&s;e to be often drunke. <HI>Saluianus</HI> in his &s;euenth booke <HI>De Prouidentia,</HI> &s;ayth that they are generally &s;o inhumane, &s;uch drunkards, &s;o deceitfull, fraudulent, couetous, treacherous, di&s;loyall, leud, lecherous, and vncha&s;te, that he that is not &s;uch an one, he &s;urely is no Africane. Lastly, there is, as he there addeth, no maner of wickedne&s;&s;e or villany that they are not giuen vnto. All hi&s;tories do make mention of the vnfaithfulne&s;&s;e and fal&s;e-heartedne&s;&s;e of this nation: which indeed is &s;uch, and they for the &s;ame &s;o greatly noted and famous, that they grew for it into a common by-word among all &s;uch nations as had any conuer&s;ation or ought to do with them. And thus much of this <HI>Africa,</HI> a land, as the Poets terme it, mo&s;t rich for triumphs; the fortre&s;&s;e or ca&s;tle, as <HI>Cicero</HI> calleth it, of all Prouinces belonging to the Romane Empire. The Ilands neere adioyning and belonging to this country, more famous and of better note, are, <HI>Melita, Menyx, Co&s;ura</HI> and <HI>Cercina;</HI> be&s;ide &s;ome other le&s;&s;er ones, and of le&s;&s;e account: of which, as al&s;o the people, ri|uers, mountaines, townes, and cities, &s;ee this our Table. That <HI>Sardinia,</HI> that goodly iland which lieth ouer again&s;t <HI>Genua,</HI> did &s;ometime belong to this <HI>Africa, Iu&s;tinian</HI> doth te&s;tifie in the &s;euen and twentieth Title of the fir&s;t booke of his Code. But of <HI>CARTHAGE,</HI> the chiefe and metropolitane citie of this prouince, although <HI>Salu&s;t</HI> &s;ayth it is better farre to &s;ay nothing at all of it, than to &s;peake little: yet notwith&s;tanding I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to adde &s;omewhat of that al&s;o in this place. This city of the Latines was called <HI>CARTHAGO,</HI> of the Greeks <HI>CHARCHEDON. Solinus Polyhi&s;tor</HI> repor|teth that it was fir&s;t called <HI>CARTHADA,</HI> which word, &s;ayth he, in the Phoenician tongue, (of neere affinity to the Hebrew and Arabicke) &s;ignifieth <HI>Ciuitatem nouam,</HI> The new city. And indeed, truth it is, that <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Arabicke dialect, and <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Kariat had&aacute;tha,</HI> in the Syrian doth &s;ignifie, <HI>A new city,</HI> or <HI>ca&s;tle.</HI> Hereupon it is that <HI>Stephanus</HI> nameth it <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, <HI>NOVAM VRBEM,</HI> The new city. He moreouer calleth it <HI>OENVSSA, CACABE,</HI> and <HI>CADMEIA,</HI> but vpon what ground and authority I know not. <HI>Cadmeia,</HI> peraduenture, it was named of the Hebrew <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, which in that language (as al&s;o in the re&s;t of the orientall tongues deriued from hence) &s;ignifieth, <HI>the Ea&s;t;</HI> or, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>chiefe&s;t:</HI> both which may well agree to this city: for the fir&s;t inhabitants, who built it, and enclo&s;ed it with an huge wall and ditch, were Ea&s;terlings, <HI>Cadmonim,</HI> or &s;uch as came thither from <HI>Kedem,</HI> the Ea&s;t. Againe, in re&s;pect of the greatne&s;&s;e, power, goodly beauty and lu&s;ture of it, it might iu&s;tly (and indeed &s;o it did, as we &s;hall &s;hew in that which followeth) de&s;erue the name of <HI>Cadmia,</HI> that is, the chiefe and principall metropolitane city: and it may be that for the &s;ame rea&s;on it was al&s;o of them called <HI>Cacabe, Stellaris,</HI> the gli&s;tring &s;tarre; of <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Caucabi,</HI> a &s;tarre: an&s;werable to <HI>A&s;teria,</HI> or <HI>A&s;teris,</HI> an iland in the Midland&s;ea: <HI>A&s;terius</HI> the name of a place in the ile <HI>Tenedos: A&s;tron,</HI> or <HI>A&s;trum,</HI> a riuer of <HI>Troas,</HI> i&s;&s;uing out of the mount <HI>Ida,</HI> as <HI>Pli|ny</HI> te&s;tifieth: Item, a great and goodly city of <HI>Argia</HI> in <HI>Peloponne&s;us:</HI> with diuers other places in <HI>Greekland,</HI> of the like denomination; all deriued from <HI>A&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>A&s;trum,</HI> which in the Greeke tongue &s;ignifie A &s;tarre. There are many learned men, which do thinke, that in the Holy Scripture this ci|ty is called and de&s;cribed by the name of <HI>THARSIS.</HI> And thus much of the ancient names and appellations of this city: for in &s;uccedent ages it hath beene called al&s;o by diuers others be&s;ide the&s;e, as we &s;hall &s;hew hereafter. Yea and ancient writers haue graced it with diuers honorable titles and epithites: calling it <HI>Cel&s;am</HI> and <HI>Almam,</HI> The Stately and Honourable city <HI>Carthage: Apuleius</HI> nameth it, <HI>Romani imperij aemulam, terrarum orbis aui|dam; Prouinciae magi&s;tram venerabilem; Africae Mu&s;am coele&s;tem; Camaenam togatorum;</HI> The great enuier of the Romane &s;tate, and yet it &s;elfe de&s;iring all the &s;ouereignty of the world; The honourable mi&s;tre&s;&s;e of the Prouince; The heauenly Mu&s;e of <HI>Africa;</HI> The delight and paradi&s;e of the gentry of the land. Of <HI>Solinus</HI> it is intituled, <HI>Alterum po&s;t vrbem Romam terrarum decus:</HI> Next after the goodly city of <HI>Rome</HI> the only glory of the world. Of <HI>Ptolemey, Manilius</HI> &amp; <HI>Pliny</HI> it is called <HI>Magna,</HI> The great city. Of <HI>Victor Vticen&s;is</HI> &amp; <HI>Suidas, Maxima orbis terrarum,</HI> The greate&s;t city of the whole world. And that not without iu&s;t cau&s;e: for <HI>Oro&s;ius</HI> te&s;tifieth that it was twenty miles about within the walles, almo&s;t round enclo&s;ed with the &s;ea.

And thus it continued for the &s;pace of one hundred and one yeeres: when by the commandement and pre&s;cript of the Se|nate it was againe reedified, who, &s;ending thither certeine people to inhabit and dwell there, made it a Romane colony: and this was the fir&s;t colony of the Romans that euer was tran&s;ported foorth of <HI>Italy.</HI> It was of <HI>Cayus Gracchus</HI> called <HI>IVNONIA,</HI> as it is recorded by <HI>Appian, Solinus,</HI> and <HI>Dion;</HI> who al&s;o addeth that it was afterward by <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar</HI> againe the &s;econd time made a Colony: becau&s;e that when <HI>Lepidus</HI> had wa&s;ted a great part of it, and left it de&s;titute and without inhabitants, he in maner &s;eemed to haue di&s;&s;olued the right and priuiledge of the Colony. Therefore this city began againe to flouri&s;h, and vnder the Romane Emperours, to be renowmed vnder the name of <HI>The &s;econd Carthage.</HI> So that that city which lately was re|nowmed for &s;eats of armes and martiall prowes, was now, as <HI>Martianus</HI> writeth, as honourable for worldly felicity and all maner of earthly ble&s;&s;ings. It ta&s;ted al&s;o of the beneuolence and bounteous magnificence of the Emperour <HI>Hadrian,</HI> and thereupon it was of him called <HI>HADRIANOPOLIS,</HI> that is, <HI>Hadrians city,</HI> as <HI>Spartianus</HI> hath left recorded. Item, the Romane Emperour <HI>Antoninus Pius</HI> did much grace it with many &s;umptuous and &s;tately buildings as you may reade in <HI>Pau&s;anias. Lampridius</HI> writeth, that in re&s;pect of the fauourable kindne&s;&s;e of the Emperour <HI>Commodus</HI> toward this ci|ty, it was in like maner of him named <HI>ALEXANDRIA COMMODIANA TOGATA.</HI> But, (as the &s;tate of all things vnder the cope of heauen is vncon&s;tant and variable) the &s;ame city vnder <HI>Gordianus</HI> the Emperour, was, as <HI>Herodian</HI> te&s;tifieth, by one <HI>Capellianus</HI> Lieutenant of <HI>Mauritania</HI> taken the &s;econd time, and &s;poiled, about &s;ix hundred and foure &s;core yeeres after it fir&s;t had &s;ubmitted it &s;elfe to the command and iuri&s;diction of the Ro|mans. In the reigne of <HI>Honorius</HI> the Emperour it was by treachery the third time taken, &s;acked, and vtterly defaced, by <HI>Gen&s;erichus</HI> king of the Wan|dals, in the foure hundred and thirty yeere after the incarnation of <HI>CHRIST</HI> our Sauiour. The like it &s;uffered of certeine mutinous &s;ouldiers vnder one <HI>Salomon</HI> a lieutenant of the <HI>Mauru&s;ij,</HI> or <HI>Barbary,</HI> as <HI>Procopius</HI> hath recorded. From the&s;e it was woon by <HI>Beli&s;arius,</HI> in the yeere of <HI>CHRIST</HI> fiue hundred thirty eight, in the time of <HI>Iu&s;tinian</HI> the Romane Emperour, who cau&s;ed it to be repaired, and fortified with a &s;trong wall and deepe ditch; who moreouer beautified it with many goodly publike buildings, of mo&s;t curious architecture, as Cloi&s;ters, Galleries, the Theodorian Bathes, the gorgeous Church of our Lady, the chiefe Saint, and others which are reckoned vp by the &s;ame <HI>Procopius.</HI> After this it continued vnder the Romans vntill the time of <HI>Heraclius</HI> the Emperour, when as it was conquered and &s;urpri&s;ed by the Per&s;ians, about the yeere of <HI>CHRIST</HI> &s;ix hundred and &s;ixteene. It was taken, &s;acked, and &s;poiled by the Egyptians, three &s;core and &s;ix yeeres after that, as <HI>Procopius</HI> and others do con&s;tantly witne&s;&s;e. Neither was this the la&s;t mi&s;ery of this city: for it being &s;poiled, ra&s;ed almo&s;t to the ground, layed wa&s;te, and left di&s;peopled and void of inhabitants, by the Mahumetanes; &s;o continued vnto the dayes of one <HI>Elmahdi</HI> a Bi&s;hop, who, as <HI>Iohannes Leo Africanus</HI> reporteth, gaue it vnto certeine people of that countrey, which were in number &s;o few, that they did not repleni&s;h aboue the twentieth part of it. The &s;ame authour, an eye witne&s;&s;e of that which he wrote, affirmeth that of all this greatne&s;&s;e and glory, be&s;ide certeine ruines of the walles and a part of the Conduit, there remaineth at thus day not any whit or mention at all. This now in the&s;e our dayes is the fate and forme of this mo&s;t goodly city. This is that city, which, as <HI>Herodian</HI> te&s;tifieth, in time pa&s;t for wealth, mul|titude of people, and greatne&s;&s;e of circuit, did only yeeld it &s;elfe inferiour to <HI>Rome;</HI> and with <HI>Alexandria</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> long contended for the &s;econd place. Item, this is it which long &s;ince was of that power that it commanded all the &s;ea coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> from <HI>Arae Philenorum,</HI> all along as far as to the Straights of <HI>Gibraltar:</HI> ouer which they pa&s;&s;ing by &s;hip, conquered all <HI>Spaine,</HI> euen vp as high as the Pyreny mountaines. So that <HI>Appian,</HI> a graue writer, doth deeme the Empire and command of this city, of equall value to the power of the far-commanding Greeks, or wealth &amp; riches of the braue Per&s;ian: which were an ea&s;ie matter for one to iu&s;tify out of <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> two authours of good credit. For this man affirmeth, that this city commanded in <HI>Africa</HI> alone three hundred cities; and it &s;elfe conteined &s;euenty thou&s;and men, dayly inhabitants within the walles of the &s;ame. Item, <HI>Scipio</HI> hauing conque|red this city, tran&s;ported from thence vnto <HI>Rome</HI> foure hundred and &s;euenty thou&s;and pound weight of &s;iluer. Of this city, (which, as long as it &s;tood out, and was ma&s;ter of it &s;elfe, as <HI>Trogus</HI> witne&s;&s;eth, was e&s;teemed as a godde&s;&s;e; and in <HI>Africa,</HI> as <HI>Saluianus</HI> writeth, was accounted as another <HI>Rome</HI>) there remaineth now no more but the bare name onely. Of the nation of the Africans, from whence they came into this country, and what they were, <HI>Pro|copius,</HI> in the eleuenth booke of his Hi&s;tory of the Wandals, hath written &s;omewhat worth the ob&s;eruation.</P>
<P>Of Heauen-walke, <HI>(Via coele&s;tis)</HI> which we in a word touched before, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e here in this place to &s;peake &s;omewhat more at large. In <HI>Victor Vticen&s;is</HI> the&s;e words following are read in all copies that euer I &s;aw: <HI>Nam &amp; hodi&egrave; &s;i qua &s;uper&s;unt, &s;ubinde de&s;olantur, &s;icut in Carthagi|neo Theatro aedem Memoriae &amp; viam quam Caele&s;tis vocitabant, funditus deleuerunt.</HI> For <HI>viam,</HI> I make no question but the authour did write <HI>etiam,</HI> that it might be referred to <HI>aedem,</HI> (or <HI>templum,</HI> as <HI>Iulius Capitolinus</HI> in <HI>Pertinax,</HI> doth call it) that is, a chapell, temple or church. Further|more, of this <HI>Caele&s;tis dea,</HI> Heauenly godde&s;&s;e, as <HI>Capitolinus</HI> in <HI>Macrinus</HI> and <HI>Trebellius Pollio</HI> in <HI>Cel&s;us tyrannus,</HI> do call her a godde&s;&s;e peculiar to <HI>Africa,</HI> there are here and there diuers things to be ob&s;erued in diuers authours. <HI>Aelianus</HI> writeth that the Egyptians doe call <HI>Venus, Vrania,</HI> that is, Heauenly. <HI>Venus caele&s;tis</HI> (which is all one) is expre&s;&s;ed in an ancient piece of coine which I haue of <HI>Iulia So&euml;mia's. S. Augu&s;tine</HI> in his booke <HI>De ci|uitate Dei</HI> doth &s;peake of the Heauenly Virgine <HI>(Virgo caele&s;tis)</HI> meaning doubtle&s;&s;e the Heauenly godde&s;&s;e: but by that epithite, I &s;uppo&s;e, he had a purpo&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h her from that other; I meane that wanton, which <HI>Iulius Firmicus</HI> calleth <HI>Venerem virginem. Herodian</HI> nameth her <HI>Vrania;</HI> and addeth moreouer, that of the Phoenicians &s;he is called <HI>A&s;troarche. Alilat, Herodotus</HI> &s;ayth &s;he was named, and affirmeth that it is the Moone. <HI>S. Hierome</HI> in his treati&s;e again&s;t <HI>Symmachus</HI> writeth that the Per&s;ians call her <HI>Mithra. idque pro diuer&s;itate nominis, non pro numinis varietate;</HI> all the&s;e different names &s;ignifying, as <HI>S. Ambro&s;e</HI> &s;ayth, one and the &s;ame godde&s;&s;e. <HI>Apuleius</HI> in the &s;ixth booke of his Golden A&s;&s;e, witne&s;&s;eth that all the nations of the Ea&s;t countreys do generally call her <HI>Zigia.</HI> There is a notable record of this godde&s;&s;e, this <HI>Caele&s;tis Venus,</HI> in the eleuenth booke of the &s;ame treati&s;e of <HI>Apuleius:</HI> which he there calleth both by the name of <HI>Regina caeli,</HI> The Queene of heauen; and <HI>Syria dea,</HI> the Syrian godde&s;&s;e. Of who&s;e diuers and manifold forme or &s;hape, the great variety of di&s;tinct and different names of the &s;ame, if any man be de&s;irous to know more particularly, let him haue recour&s;e to this fore&s;ayd authour, as al&s;o to Lucians treati&s;e intituled <HI>De Dea Syria;</HI> to which if he &s;hall adioyne certeine coines of the Emperours, <HI>Seuerus</HI> and <HI>Antoninus</HI> his &s;onne, he &s;hall vnder&s;tand that in this one idoll, almo&s;t all the diuinity of the ancient Gentiles is comprehended. <HI>Phila&s;trius,</HI> who wrote of the here&s;ies of former times, &s;ayth that this godde&s;&s;e was of certeine hereticall Iewes named <HI>Fortuna caeli,</HI> Heauenly fortune. I might ea&s;ily be drawen to beleeue, that this very godde&s;&s;e is that idoll which <HI>Ieremy</HI> in the foure and fortieth chapter of his Prophe&s;ie, doth terme The Queene of heauen. To whom the wicked I&s;raelites did offer &s;acrifice, and reuerence as to the immortall God. For it was not hard for this nation, &s;o prone and inclined to idolatry, out of their next neighbour <HI>Hierapolis,</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> (where <HI>Lucian</HI> te&s;tifieth this godde&s;&s;e was mo&s;t religiou&s;ly wor&s;hipped) to tran&s;port this idoll into their countrey <HI>Palae&s;tina,</HI> as the Phoenicians did out of the &s;ame <HI>Syria</HI> conuey her beyond the &s;ea to <HI>Carthage:</HI> vnder the conduct and leading, as is probable (and which <HI>Herodotus</HI> iu&s;tifieth to be true) of Queene <HI>Dido, Agenors</HI> daughter. Many other things of this godde&s;&s;e, out of diuers other authours, might heere to the&s;e be adioyned: but we at this time are content, with <HI>Plato</HI> to demon&s;trate that there were two <HI>Venu&s;es:</HI> of which, one, whom the Carthaginians did wor&s;hip, was this which hitherto we haue &s;poken of: that &s;ame, I meane, which was called <HI>Dea Syria,</HI> or <HI>Venus A&s;&s;yria,</HI> as <HI>Oppian</HI> in his fir&s;t booke of Hunting calleth her. This, I do vnder&s;tand out of the &s;ixt booke of <HI>Apuleius,</HI> was the &s;ame that <HI>Iuno</HI> was, where he termeth her <HI>Vecturam leonis,</HI> The burden or cariage of the lion: and whom they report, Did loue olde <HI>Carthage</HI> more than all the world be&s;ide: for here her charet alwayes &s;tood, her weapons here did lie; as the Poet writeth of her: whereupon I make no que&s;tion, the city <HI>Carthage</HI> was for the &s;ame rea|&s;on al&s;o called <HI>Iunonia:</HI> for &s;o I finde it recorded by <HI>Plutarch</HI> and <HI>Solinus.</HI> By her <HI>Charet,</HI> I vnder&s;tand the <HI>Lion,</HI> vpon which &s;he rode: by her <HI>wea|pons,</HI> the <HI>thunderbolt,</HI> with the other en&s;ignes of the gods and godde&s;&s;es, which in tho&s;e forenamed coines are expre&s;&s;ed. <HI>Saluianus</HI> in his booke <HI>De Prouidentia,</HI> maketh mention of an Heauenly god <HI>(Deus caele&s;tis)</HI> an idoll al&s;o of the Africans. <HI>Vlpianus</HI> in like maner, in the Tit. <HI>qui haeredes in&s;titui po&s;&s;unt, &sect; deo haeredis,</HI> &s;peaketh of <HI>Caele&s;tis deus Salinen&s;is Carthaginen&s;is.</HI> But this is nothing to this our godde&s;&s;e. And peraduenture, we, purpo&s;edly &s;peaking of Geography, haue &s;ayd too much of this godde&s;&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>_AEgypt</HI> is the gift and fauour of <HI>Nilus:</HI> For antiquity did verily thinke that all that whole tract, which now this countrey doth po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e, was &s;ometime a creeke or bay of the Midland &s;ea; and by the oft ouerflowing and tides of the &s;ame, was at length filled vp, and &s;o made firme land.

It vnladeth it &s;elfe, as mo&s;t men thinke, and all antiquity hath con&s;tantly affirmed, into the Midland &s;ea by &s;euen mouthes or very great floudgates. <HI>Ptolemey</HI> in his time made mention of nine, but of them, two were fal&s;e gates (<HI>p&s;eudo&s;tomata,</HI> he termeth them) then almo&s;t quite &s;topped vp. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;peaketh of eleuen, of which foure were fal&s;e gates, the other &s;euen were great and more renowmed. <HI>Herodotus</HI> al&s;o mentioneth two fal&s;e gates, but in all he &s;peaketh not of more than &s;euen: with him <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> word for word agreeth. And that which of the&s;e mouthes or falles are of this man held for a trueth, in others are held for fal&s;e and contrariwi&s;e. The like difference there is about the names and proper appellations of the&s;e mouthes, euen in the be&s;t approoued authours. <HI>Pliny</HI> ma|keth <HI>Heracleoticum</HI> to be a diuers and di&s;tinct mouth from <HI>Canopicum:</HI> in which notwith&s;tanding, it &s;eemeth, he is much deceiued: yea and <HI>Diodo|rus Siculus</HI> doth flatly deny it, affirming that <HI>Canopicum</HI> is otherwi&s;e named <HI>Herculeum,</HI> or <HI>Heracleoticum.</HI> All this difference about the names, number, and nature of the&s;e mouthes, if I mi&s;take not the matter, aro&s;e in continuance of time, from the change and alteration of places. For euery man de|&s;cribeth them according to the &s;ituation of the &s;ea coa&s;t, as it then was in that time wherein he liued, which by violence of tide and inundatious, drifts of &s;and and &s;hifting of the &s;ame backe againe, in proce&s;&s;e of time haue &s;ometime one forme, &s;omtime another, as is very likely, and they do very well know which dwell neere to the &s;ea; who do neuer wonder to &s;ee riuers change their channels and leaue their ancient cour&s;e: to &s;ee their mouthes &s;ometime to be quite dette vp with &s;and, and to &s;eeke new i&s;&s;ues and channels, where neuer none were before: or to &s;ee them which in former times were not nauigable, but full of flats and &s;helfs, afterward to become deepe and able to entertaine &s;hips of good burden. <HI>Galen</HI> &s;ayth, that this riuer, for goodne&s;&s;e of water, hath but few peeres. <HI>A|rethaeus</HI> the Cappadotian &s;ayth that the water is thicke: <HI>Plutarch</HI> in the eighth booke of his <HI>Conuiual.</HI> calleth it <HI>turbidam</HI> troubled, and muddy: <HI>Statius</HI> in his fourth booke <HI>Amor.</HI> &s;ayth that it is &s;weet, and coole without any vnplea&s;antne&s;&s;e in ta&s;te: and therefore he addeth in the &s;ame place that the Egyptians do neuer feare any want or dearth of wine. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;ayth, that for &s;weetne&s;&s;e it doth &s;urpa&s;&s;e all other riuers in the whole world be&s;ide: which opinion of his, <HI>Pe&s;cennius Niger,</HI> an Emperor, did long &s;ince auouch to be true, when he thus an&s;wered his garri&s;on &s;ouldiers, demanding wine of him, Haue ye <HI>Nilus,</HI> and yet do ye demand wine? A de&s;cription of this riuer thou mai&s;t &s;ee in <HI>Claudian.</HI> Of his inundation and ouerflowing euery yere, be&s;ide others, reade <HI>Stra|bo,</HI> and the Panegyricke oration pronounced before <HI>Traian</HI> Emperour of <HI>Rome.</HI> Item <HI>Achilles Statius</HI> and <HI>Heliodorus.</HI> He that li&s;teth and hath more vacant time, to the&s;e may adde <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his treati&s;e of mountaines. Mountaines of <HI>Egypt,</HI> be&s;ide tho&s;e which <HI>Ptolemey</HI> mentioneth; namely, <HI>Mon|tes Libyci, Troicus, Alaba&s;trinus, Porphyritis, Smaragdus, Aiaces, Acabes, Niger, Ba&s;anites,</HI> and <HI>Pentadactylus,</HI> are diuers, as <HI>Nitria, Pherme, Sinopius, Climax, Eos, Lacmon, Crophi,</HI> and <HI>Mophi.</HI> They haue many Fennes, yet the&s;e two only, <HI>Moeris</HI> and <HI>Maria,</HI> are of name.</P>
<P>Ancient writers haue diuided this countrey into many <HI>Nomous, (Pliny</HI> expoundeth it Shires or Counties, ech hauing a Shiriffe or Lieutenant ouer it) of which <HI>Herodotus</HI> mentioneth but <HI>18. Diodorus Siculus</HI> &s;ayth that there were of them <HI>36.</HI> and <HI>Ptolemcy</HI> &s;peaketh of <HI>46.</HI> and reckoneth them vp all by their &s;euerall names: and &s;o many or more <HI>Pliny</HI> telleth vs of. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth of <HI>36.</HI> and thus generally pointeth them out: <HI>Thebais,</HI> &s;aith he, conteined <HI>10. Delta</HI> as many: and <HI>Middle Egypt 16.</HI> But we out of all &s;orts of olde writers haue found aboue <HI>60.</HI> decyphered by their &s;euerall names and &s;ituation, and haue brought them within the compa&s;&s;e of this Mappe. But with <HI>Pliny</HI> we find by experience, that the names of them oft times are changed, and one place put for another: of which we haue &s;poken more fully in our Geographicall trea&s;urie. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> writeth that in this one countrey there were more cities, than in all the whole world be&s;ide. <HI>Egypt,</HI> be&s;ide their brag of great antiquity, boa&s;teth, that in the time of <HI>Ama&s;is</HI> their king, it had <HI>20000.</HI> cities: and now it hath very many, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;ayth, although they be but &s;mall and of no great account. Of the&s;e, there &s;tood but <HI>3000.</HI> vnto <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> his time. We, although

<PB REF="309"> we haue mo&s;t diligently &s;ought the names of them out of all maner of writings and monuments of antiquity, yet we could not finde mention of many more than <HI>300.</HI> as this Mappe doth giue thee to vnder&s;tand. Thus mighty <HI>Ioue</HI> doth &s;port him&s;elfe in earthly things.</P>
<P>The Mappe doth &s;hew the &s;ituation of this countrey, and therefore I &s;hall not need to &s;peake ought of that. What the great fertility and richne&s;&s;e of &s;oile of this prouince was, that worthy commendation vulgarly &s;poken of it, wherein it is &s;ayd to be, <HI>The common barne of all the world,</HI> doth &s;ufficiently &s;hew. For, although it neuer raineth here, yet it breedeth great plenty of men and bea&s;ts, with all maner of cattell what&s;oeuer. But this indeed their riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> by his inundation euery yeere, bringeth to pa&s;&s;e: wherupon, as the poet <HI>Lucan</HI> writeth, this is <HI>Terra &s;uis contenta bonis, non indiga mercis, Aut Iouis: in &s;olo tanta e&s;t fiducia Nilo:</HI> A land that of it &s;elfe is rich enough, It need'th no forren aid, Ioues helpe it &s;corn'th: &s;o much it &s;tand'th, vpon the bounty of the Nile. Yea they were woont proudly to vaunt, as <HI>Pliny</HI> te&s;tifieth, that they caried in their hands the dearth or plenty of the Romans tho&s;e mighty conquerours. The riches and wealth of this countrey one may ea&s;ily e&s;teeme, by that of <HI>Diodorus,</HI> who writeth that the Kings of <HI>Egypt</HI> v&s;ed yerely to haue, of <HI>Alexandria</HI> only, a Sub&s;idie of aboue twelue thou&s;and ta|lents; item, out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> in whom I reade that <HI>Auletes,</HI> father to <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> leuied yeerely in <HI>Egypt</HI> a Sub&s;idie of twelue thou&s;and and fiue hundred talents (which doth amount, according to <HI>Budey</HI> his estimation, to &s;euenty fiue hundred thou&s;and French crownes:) and that, as he there addeth, vnder a very loo&s;e and bad kinde of gouernment. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his &s;econd booke <HI>de Praepar. Euang.</HI> reporteth that <HI>O&s;iris</HI> their king did erect and make, for <HI>Iupiter</HI> and <HI>Iuno</HI> his parents, and for other gods, temples and &s;hrines of beaten gold and &s;iluer: a maruellous &s;hew of their woonderfull wealth and riches Of the golde-mines of this countrey <HI>Agathar|cides</HI> hath written &s;omething. But &s;o many endle&s;&s;e and immortall works yet extant, hauing hitherto euen to this day abode all a&s;&s;aults and iniury of time, do &s;uffici|ently &s;hew what their great command and power in former times hath beene; as namely, are tho&s;e huge <HI>Pyramides,</HI> &s;o many <HI>Obelisks</HI> of &s;olid marble of one whole &s;tone of &s;uch woonderfull height, <HI>Colo&s;&s;es, Sphinges, Statues,</HI> and <HI>Labyrinths:</HI> &s;o many gorgeous <HI>Temples,</HI> of which this one countrey could &s;hew more than all o|ther countreys be&s;ide what&s;oeuer, as <HI>Herodotus,</HI> who him&s;elfe was an eye-witne&s;&s;e of the &s;ame, doth plainly affirme. The infinite number of people and inhabitants (which <HI>Philo,</HI> in his booke of Circumci&s;ion, a&s;cribeth vnto it) gather out of <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Ege&s;ippus,</HI> who writeth, that be&s;ide the citizens of <HI>Alexandria</HI> (which as <HI>Diodorus</HI> te&s;tifieth, were three hundred thou&s;and free men) there were &s;euenteene hundred and fifty thou&s;and enrolled and made free-deni&s;ons of <HI>Rome</HI> at once.</P>
<P>It is a very prudent and wi&s;e nation, as we may vnder&s;tand by diuers hi&s;tories; very ingenious in the finding out of any maner of artes and &s;ciences: very quicke of conceit in the &s;earch of any inuention what&s;oeuer, as <HI>Aulus Gellius</HI> hath left recorded. They are fit and able to attaine to the vnder&s;tanding of all maner of diuine knowledge, as <HI>Macrobius</HI> affirmeth; who al&s;o calleth <HI>Egypt, The mother of all artes.</HI> But <HI>Trebellius Pollio,</HI> in the life of <HI>Aemilianus</HI> the Tyrant, &s;ayth that it is a furious and outragious nation, ea&s;ily mooued to &s;edition, tumults and rebellion vpon euery light occa&s;ion. And <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> &s;ayth that they are a light hea|ded and giddy brained people, more fit to &s;et matters abroach, than to follow them wi&s;ely, when they are once afoot. <HI>Hadrianus</HI> the Emperour, as <HI>Flauius Vopi&s;cus</HI> in the life of <HI>Saturninus</HI> reporteth, calleth it, <HI>Gentem leuem, pendulam, &amp; ad omnia famae monimenta volitantem:</HI> A light and vncon&s;tant nation, hanging as it were by a twin'd thread, and mooued at the lea&s;t bla&s;t and puffe of newes that might &s;tirre. <HI>Seneca</HI> to <HI>Albina</HI> calleth it <HI>Infidam,</HI> A faithle&s;&s;e nation. <HI>Vento|&s;am &amp; in&s;olentem.</HI> A bragging, proud and in&s;olent nation. <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his Panegyricke to Traian the Emperour, termeth them: <HI>Nequitias tellus &s;cit dare nulla magis:</HI> No countrey in the world I am &s;ure, More vilder knaues did ere endure, &s;ayth the Poet <HI>Martiall. Philo</HI> in his booke of Hu&s;bandry &s;ayth that they haue <HI>Innatam &amp; in&s;ignem iactantiam,</HI> that is, that, they it bred in the bone that an Egyptian &s;hould be a famous bragger. Yet he &s;ayth that they are withall wi&s;e and in|genious. <HI>Apuleius</HI> termeth them <HI>Eruditos,</HI> Learned Egyptians: and <HI>Themi&s;tius Euphrada, Sapienti&s;&s;imos homines,</HI> Very wi&s;e and cunning fellowes. <HI>Philo|&s;tratus</HI> &s;ayth, that they be much giuen to Theology and &s;tudy of heauenly things. <HI>Strabo</HI> hath left recorded, that they were no warlike people. Of famous knaues they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the middle ranke, according to that olde prouerbe, <HI>Lydimali, &s;ecundi Aegyptij, tertij Cares. The Lydians are the great knaues, The Egyptians meane knaues be, The clowni&s;h hobs of Caria are The lea&s;t knaues of the three:</HI> as <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> vpon <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer</HI> reporteth. Of the cu&s;tomes and maner of life of this nation, <HI>Porphyrius</HI> &s;peaketh much in his fourth booke, intituled, Of ab&s;tinence from fle&s;h meats. The mo&s;t famous cities, which we haue read of in the ancient writers of both languages, are the&s;e: Fir&s;t, <HI>ALEXANDRIA,</HI> which <HI>Athenaeus</HI> nameth The beautifull and golden citie: the Councell of <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> The great citie: <HI>Marcelline,</HI> The head of all cities in the world: <HI>Eunapius,</HI> Another world. <HI>Dion Pru&s;aeus</HI> &s;ayth, that it is the &s;econd citie of all that are vnder the cope of heauen. The chiefe temple heere called <HI>Seba&s;teum</HI> (or <HI>Augu&s;teum,</HI> that is, Princely, or, Emperiall) hath no peere. This thou may&s;t &s;ee de&s;cribed by <HI>Philo Iu|daeus</HI> in his booke <HI>De vita contemplatiua.</HI> The <HI>Serapium,</HI> another &s;tately building in this citie, &s;o adorned and beautified with diuers goodly galleries, many gor|geous and lofty columnes and pillars, &s;et out with mo&s;t liuely imagery, and diuers and &s;undry other rare works and deuices, the be&s;t that the mo&s;t excellent Architects of the world might inuent, that next after the Capitoll, of which reuerend <HI>Rome</HI> doth &s;o much glory, the whole world it &s;elfe hath neuer &s;eene ought more rich and &s;umptuous, at <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> writeth of it. <HI>Strabo</HI> in the &s;euenteenth booke of his Geography, doth mo&s;t brauely de&s;cribe the whole citie. The like doth <HI>Statius Alexandrinus</HI> in his fifth booke of Loue: and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> in the <HI>17</HI> booke of his hi&s;tory. Item, <HI>Hirtius</HI> in his booke <HI>De bello Alexandrino. THE|BAE</HI> was the next citie of great note, famous for the multitude of gates that &s;ometimes it had: and thereupon it was otherwi&s;e called <HI>Hecatompylos,</HI> Hundred-gate; and <HI>Dio&s;polis,</HI> Gods-towne: item, <HI>Bu&s;yris:</HI> and <HI>Thebe&s;tis,</HI> as <HI>S. Hierome</HI> affirmeth. <HI>MEMPHIS,</HI> an ancient towne, renowmed by rea&s;on that their kings ordi|narily kept their Court here, was accounted one of the greate&s;t cities of this kingdome. <HI>COPTOS,</HI> a great Mart-towne, well frequented with Arabian and Indian merchants. Of this city the whole prouince tooke the name, as we haue el&s;where &s;hewed before. <HI>ABYDVS,</HI> the Court and Emperiall &s;eat of <HI>Memnon</HI> their king, fa|mous for the temple of <HI>O&s;iris.</HI> I omit <HI>SYENE</HI> with diuers others: for it were more than needeth here to recken them vp all; becau&s;e they offer them&s;elues at an in|&s;tant, to him that &s;hall but ca&s;t his eye on the Map. Be&s;ides that, <HI>Herodotus, Diodorus, Pliny, Io&s;ephus, Marcellinus, Philo&s;tratus, Eu&s;ebius,</HI> and diuers other good authours, yet extant, and in many mens hands, haue mo&s;t eloquently and diligently de&s;cribed them, and &s;et them out in their true and liuely colours.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of this countrey, the riuers, mountaines, cities and &s;trange things there to be &s;eene, we haue already de&s;cribed, according as the capacity of the place a&s;&s;igned, would permit. Now it remaineth that with like breuity al&s;o we do, out of <HI>Diodorus, Herodotus, Strabo, Athenaeus, Aelianus, Plutarch, Philo, Eu&s;e|bius, Pliny, Heliodorus, Lucian, Ammian, Clemens, Athana&s;ius, Prudentius,</HI> and others, &s;peake &s;omething of their religion. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his fir&s;t booke <HI>De Praepar. Euang.</HI> teacheth me, that the Egyptians were the fir&s;t men, that euer honoured the Sunne, Moone and the re&s;t of the Starres, for immortall Gods. But not only the Holy &s;cripture, but euen profane authours al&s;o doe plentifully te&s;tifie that they were euer from the beginning the vaine&s;t men of the world, and in this their di|uine &s;eruice, and choice of gods, of all other mo&s;t fond and fooli&s;h: for be&s;ide the gods of the Gentiles, as <HI>Iupiter, Iuno, Vulcane, Venus, Bacchus,</HI> and &s;uch others, which they had and wor&s;hipped common with all the world, (yet by their &s;euerall and different names, as <HI>I&s;is, O&s;iris, &amp;c.</HI>) they moreouer, as <HI>Artemidorus</HI> and <HI>Ci|cero</HI> in the third booke of the Nature of gods do te&s;tifie, con&s;ecrated all kinde of bea&s;ts and liuing creatures. <HI>Herodotus</HI> affirmeth, that they accounted all maner of bea&s;ts which they had in <HI>Egypt,</HI> as &s;acred and holy; &s;o that, as <HI>Dion</HI> reporteth, they farre &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all nations of the world in multitude and variety of gods. Nei|ther did they only reuerence the&s;e as gods, but al&s;o <HI>Anubis, Orus, Typhon, Pan</HI> (whom they called <HI>Mendon</HI> and painted him with a goats head) and the Satyrs. Item another, which, as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>O&s;iris</HI> writeth, they called <HI>Cneph.</HI> Moreouer, <HI>Minutius Felix</HI> &s;ayth, that they wor&s;hipped a man, and in the city <HI>Anabis</HI> did all maner of diuine &s;eruice vnto him, as vnto an immortall God, as <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> auoucheth; who furthermore addeth, that they had another peculiar god, which they cal|led <HI>Canopus,</HI> and expre&s;&s;ed in the forme of a pot. (This <HI>Bembus</HI> hath de&s;cribed in his Hieroglyphicall table.) <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> and <HI>Heliodorus</HI> doe te&s;tifie, that they accounted the water, but e&s;pecially <HI>Nilus,</HI> for a god. Of foure footed bea&s;ts, the Crocodile, the Oxe, the Mneuis, the Lion, the Beare, the Cat, the Hee-goat, the Monkey, the Ape, the Bull, the Ramme, the Shee-goat, the Hogge, the Dogge, the Ichneumon or Indian rat, the Woolfe, the Sheepe, the Weazell, and the Shrew|mous, they put into the inuentory of their gods. Of fi&s;hes, the Oxyrinchus, the Lepidotus, the Latus, the Phagrus, the Maeotis (fi&s;hes proper to the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI>) and the Eccle: be&s;ide the Cantharus, as <HI>Porphyrius</HI> in his booke <HI>De &s;acrificijs</HI> te&s;tifieth. Of birds, the Eagle, the Ibis, and the Hawke: be&s;ide the Ow&s;ell or Blacke-bird, if we may beleeue <HI>Hyginus:</HI> and the Vulture and Rauen, as <HI>Aelianus</HI> affirmeth: with the Sparrow, as <HI>Porphyrius</HI> in his Treati&s;e <HI>De Ab&s;tinentia,</HI> maketh vs be|leeue. <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> in his &s;econd booke again&s;t <HI>Appion</HI> &s;ayth that they wor&s;hip the Ferrit. They had be&s;ide the&s;e, the Dragon, (or &s;erpent) the A&s;pis (which they na|med <HI>Thermathis</HI>) and the Beetle. The counterfets of the&s;e for the mo&s;t part they adored and wor&s;hipped as gods; yet &s;ome delighted rather to honour the very beast them&s;elues aliue: &s;o that it was felony for a man to kill any of them, although it were by chance. And if &s;o be that one of them &s;hould fortune to die of any di&s;ea&s;e, they v&s;ed to bury it with mourning and great &s;olemnity. Item certaine vegetable things without life, as Onions, Leekes, and Garleeke, they did adore with diuine ho|nour, as <HI>S. Hierome,</HI> again&s;t <HI>Iouinian,</HI> te&s;tifieth of the <HI>Pelu&s;iotae.</HI> Nay they did not content them&s;elues with the&s;e naturall things, but euen certeine mon&s;ters, &s;uch as were neuer &s;eene in the world, they did in like maner con&s;ecrate for gods: as the Cynocephalus, with a dogges head, wor&s;hipped of the Hermopolitani: and Cepus, honoured of the Babylonians. To the&s;e you may adde out of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> the Serpenticipites, idols with &s;erpents heads: and A&s;inicipites, with a&s;&s;es heads. Moreo|uer, in the villages and vpland townes, <HI>Lucian</HI> reporteth, (I know not whether in ie&s;t or earne&s;t) that &s;ome held the right &s;houlder for a god: but tho&s;e that dwelt o|uer again&s;t them, the left. Some did &s;acrifice to the one halfe of the head: others to a Samian cup or di&s;h. <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> reporteth, (I blu&s;h to &s;peake it) that they accounted the priuy parts for a god. <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> in the &s;econd booke <HI>De praeparat.

Clemens</HI> in the fifth booke of his <HI>Recognitionum</HI> addeth (blu&s;h fooli&s;h idolaters, for I will tell it, and let another &s;ay &s;urreuerence) that the Egyptians wor&s;hipped the Iakes and a Part for their gods; which al&s;o is auerred and iu&s;tified by <HI>Minutius Felix.</HI> This is that which <HI>Lactantius</HI> reporteth of them, that they reuerenced certaine bea&s;tly and &s;hamefull things. <HI>Philo Iudaeus</HI> &s;ayth, that all things vnder the cope of heauen are con&s;ecrated and enrowled amongst the number of their gods. And <HI>Sextus</HI> the Philo&s;opher &s;ayth of them, that there was not any thing which they did not hold for &s;acred. Thus much of their gods: more thou maye&s;t &s;ee of this matter in <HI>Clemens,</HI> but e&s;peci|ally in <HI>Iuuenall</HI> the Poet.

Afterward, when the light of the Go&s;pell began to &s;hine forth, here great &s;warmes of Monkes and Heremites were bred, and from hence were &s;pred and &s;cattered all Chri&s;tendome ouer, as we finde in the Records of the Primitiue Church: &s;o that a man may iu&s;tly terme this countrey The Seminary or Nur&s;ery of all religions.

<HEAD>The VOIAGE of ALEXANDER THE GREAT.</HEAD>
<P>_IF Archelaus the Chorographer, whom Diogenes La&euml;rtius affirmeth to haue de&s;cribed all that part of the earthly globe or maine continent conquered by Alexander the Great, that famous king of Macedony: or Beton [<HI>Baeton,</HI> Athenaeus calleth him] and Dio|genetus, whom Pliny writeth were the mea&s;urers of the iourney of the &s;aid Alexander: or if the Commentaries of Strabo, which he &s;aith that he compo&s;ed of the hi&s;tories and famous acts of that great Conquerour, were now extant, it would out of all doubt haue beene an ea&s;ier matter for vs to haue made this map which heere we purpo&s;e to &s;et foorth to the view and benefit of the &s;erious &s;tu|dent of Geography, of the VOIAGE OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT: But being de&s;titute of tho&s;e helpes, fir&s;t we haue laid the plot of it out of Ptolemey, and &s;ome other later writers. Then we haue &s;et downe in it all tho&s;e particular places which Quin|tus Curtius, Arrianus and Plutarch doe make mention of in the hi&s;torie of this expedition. For the&s;e three, of all tho&s;e which haue at large written of his life, and are come to our hands, haue of purpo&s;e handled this his voiage and expedition. To the&s;e, as helps, we haue adioined what we finde making for this our purpo&s;e, in Strabo, Diodorus, Trogus, Oro&s;ius and Plutarch, in that his booke which he hath intituled, Of the fortune and pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e of Alexander, for the&s;e men, although they haue not purpo&s;edly intended that argument, yet notwith&s;tanding by the way they haue &s;hewed them&s;elues, in the &s;etting out of his memorable acts, very diligent and faithfull authours. Item Philo&s;tratus, Solinus and Pliny haue in like maner done vs &s;ome &s;eruice heerein. And while I looke ouer all maner of hi&s;tories written either in Greeke or Latine, by any other authours what&s;oeuer, be&s;ide tho&s;e aboue named, I could picke very little or nothing out of them, that might &s;erue vs in this our argument to any &s;ted at all. For although &s;ome things may be ob&s;erued in the reading of Liuy, Valerius Maximus Polybius, Athenaeus, Polyaenus, Aelianus, Seneca, Stobaeus, Quintilian, Apuleius, Dion Pruiaeus, Maximus Tyrius, Theon Sophi&s;ta, Plutarch in his treati&s;e of Moun|teins, and the Panegyricke made to Maxim. and Con&s;tant. yet tho&s;e doe rather &s;eeme in my iudgement, to concerne his priuate life, naturall inclination, maners, ver|tues, and vices, then this his voiage and expedition. Francis Iuret, in his annotations vpon Symmachus, doth confe&s;&s;e that he hath by him the life of Alexander the Great, written fir&s;t in the Greeke tongue by one Ae&s;ope, and &s;ince that tran&s;lated into Latine by Iulius Valerius. This authour as yet we haue nor &s;eene, and therefore of him we &s;ay nothing. We haue therefore (in the de&s;cription of this Empire of the Macedonians, the greate&s;t, as Liuy in his fiue and fortieth booke nameth it, of all the whole earth, begunne by this our Alexander) performed what we could, not what we would. To this we haue cau&s;ed the plot and portraiture of Iupiter Ammons o|racle, famous, as Pomponius Mela writeth, for the certainty of his predictions, to be adioined for an auctuarie and ornament; and for that it is &s;o often named &amp; men|tioned in all ancient hi&s;tories: as al&s;o for that this our Alexander in this his expedition, went vnto this place, to demand of the Oracle what the i&s;&s;ue and euent of this his iourney &s;hould be. La&s;tly Curtins and Trogus do iointly affirme that he commanded that his body, after his death, &s;hould heere be buried although it be certaine that this was not performed: for his corps was interred at Alexandria in Egypt. Of it therefore out of &s;undrie authours we haue collected that which followeth.</P>

<HEAD>The ORACLE of Iupiter Ammon.</HEAD>
<P>THe place where the temple of Iupiter Ammon &s;tood hath round about it va&s;t and huge wilderne&s;&s;es, great heapes of hungry &s;and, round enclo&s;ed on euery &s;ide with wa&s;te and barren grounds, places wholly vnmanured and vnhabitable. Heere are diuers large fields, as Arrianus, Curtius and Diodorus Siculus doe de&s;cribe them, cleane couered ouer with &s;and, like as we oft times &s;ee low-meddowes ouerflowed by the breaking in of &s;ome great riuer. The midde&s;t of this place (Silius Itali|cus calleth it <HI>Lucus fatidicus,</HI> The fate-telling wood) which conteineth but a little plot of ground (for where it is broade&s;t, it is, as Arrianus writeth, but forty furlongs, or at mo&s;t, as Diodorus would haue it, not aboue fifty furlongs ouer) is be&s;et with diuers &s;orts of fruitfull trees, namely, as Arrianus te&s;tifieth, with oliues and dates: or, as Theophra&s;tus writeth, with a kinde of Cypre&s;&s;e, or &s;weet &s;melling aromaticall tree, which he calleth <HI>Thuia</HI> (our herbori&s;ts call it, The tree of life) and with the <HI>Paliurus,</HI> a kind of very &s;harpe thorne, very plentifully growing in Pale&s;tina, wherewith &s;ome learned men do verily thinke that our Sauiour Chri&s;t was crowned by the Romane &s;ouldiers, and thereupon is of &s;ome called <HI>Chri&s;ts thorne:</HI> Yea, as Diodorus Siculus reporteth, here doe grow all manner of goodly trees, but e&s;pecially all &s;orts of fruit-trees, mo&s;t plentifully. Pliny al&s;o doth highly commend the goodly palme trees of this place. It is watered with diuers plea&s;ant and hole&s;ome wels, &s;prings and brookes; and by that meanes it is inhabited, by the Ammonij, a people which dwell in cottages heere and there &s;cattering a good way di&s;tant one from another. In the midde&s;t of this place there was a tower enclo&s;ed with three wals, whereof the fir&s;t compa&s;&s;ed about or defended the ancient pallace of their kings (<HI>tyrannos,</HI> Cur|tius calleth them) within the &s;econd were kept their wiues, children and concubines: heere al&s;o &s;tood the temple or Oracle of that god. Within the third and inner wall the guard and armed men did keepe and giue their attendance. Diodorus Siculus reporteth that before the Oracle there was a fountaine, in which, all things what&s;oeuer were to be offered to the god, were fir&s;t wa&s;hed and purified. And thus farre of the naturall &s;ituation of this Oracle, and the maner of the building and ar|chitecture of the &s;ame: now it remaineth that we &s;hould in like maner &s;peake &s;omething of the forme and &s;hape of this Libyan god, as Diony&s;ius Afer termeth him; whom they painted not, as we v&s;ually do, ca&s;ting of thunderbolts, but with a paire of rams hornes vpon his head, as Arnobius, Ouid, Macrobius and others haue left recorded: and tho&s;e very crooked and wreathen, as Lucian and Ouid haue written. Lucian &s;aith that they expre&s;&s;ed him in the forme and &s;hape of a ramme: yet Hero|dotus &s;eemeth to vnder&s;tand it only of his head and face: In Martianus he is painted with a paire of rammes hornes and a iagged or fringed coat: this al&s;o is that which Atheneus meaneth when he calleth it <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, as Natalis and Dalechampius do both vnder&s;tand the word. Yet Quintus Curtius doth &s;et him out after another ma|ner, in this his de&s;cription of him; That which is wor&s;hipped for a god, hath not the &s;ame &s;hape and &s;imilitude, which commonly arti&s;tes and workemen haue attri|buted to gods: it was like a bo&s;&s;e (<HI>vmbilicus,</HI> he calleth it) made of &s;maragds and orient pearls. This idol, when an an&s;wer was demanded of it, was carried by the Prie&s;ts in a golden boate or &s;hippe, with diuers and &s;undrie &s;iluer goblets and peeces hanging round about on each &s;ide of the &s;ame. Immediately after it did follow a great company of old women and yong maidens, &s;inging in that their language a rude and homely &s;ong: whereby they doe verily beleeue they doe much plea&s;e their god, and do winne him to giue a good and certaine an&s;wer to the demand that then is made vnto him. The like doth Diodorus Siculus report of it, who moreouer addeth, the Prie&s;ts daily attendant heere were in number foureskore at the lea&s;t. Why he was painted with rammes hornes among&s;t others, Germanicus and Hyginus in Ariete, doe plainly teach vs: when they write that this temple was fir&s;t erected by Bacchus, in honour of the ramme, ( <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Hamil,</HI> the Arabians, Dutch and Spaniards call him) wh ch was his guide and conducted him, (being him&s;elfe with his whole army in great di&s;tre&s;&s;e, and almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of drinke) through the&s;e de&s;ert and &s;andy wilderne&s;&s;es, vnto this place well &s;erued with water and abounding with diuers whole&s;ome wels and &s;prings. Yet I am not ignorant that He|rodotus doth bring another rea&s;on of the &s;ame. This temple (in which, as Plutarch in his booke intituled, Of the cea&s;ing of Oracles, writeth, a lampe did burne continually) was fir&s;t erected, as Herodotus giueth out, by Thebana Aegyptia, an Aegyptian woman, a Prie&s;t of Thebes. Diodorus Siculus teacheth vs that it was built by Danaus an Egyptian. Pau&s;anias he writeth that it was &s;o called of a certaine &s;heepeheard, which fir&s;t built a temple heere to Iupiter. Virgil in his fourth booke of his Aeneides, &s;eemeth to a&s;cribe the building of it to Hiarbas King of the Getuli, and &s;onne of Iupiter. All other ancient authours for the mo&s;t part do deriue the name from the Greeke word <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, which &s;ignifieth the &s;and; &s;o that Iupiter Ammon, &s;hould bee nothing el&s;e but Sandy Ioue: yet Plutarch contrary to all men, in O&s;iris, writeth that of the Egyptians it was called <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> (or <HI>Thamos,</HI> as Plato in his dialogue intituled Phaedrus, affirmeth) which word in that language he there moreouer addeth, doth &s;ignifie an hiding, or any thing that is hid and &s;ecret, for proofe whereof he bringeth in Manethon Sebennites, an Egyptian borne, for a witne&s;&s;e: affir|ming withall that this idol is corruptly and fal&s;ely called Ammon. And indeed the learned doe know that in the Chaldey tongue, (a language of neere affinity vnto the Egyptian) <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Hama,</HI> doth &s;ignifie to hide, or to conceale from the &s;ight of other mens eies: in the eight and twentieth chapter of Iob: item, to e&s;cape, and be|take him&s;elfe to &s;ome place of refuge, to take &s;anctuary: except the copies in tho&s;e places be corrupt and faulty. But this is certaine that <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Tham,</HI> or <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Tamtam,</HI> in the &s;ame language doth &s;ignifie, to &s;hut vp, to locke vp or hide from the &s;ight of others; as men doe their trea&s;ures, an&s;wering directly to the Hebrew theme <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Thaman.</HI> I cannot but woonder when I call to mind the in&s;cription of an Egyptian obeliske or &s;tatue erected in the city Thebes by king Rame&s;&s;es, where there is oft mention made of Ammon, as thou mai&s;t read in the &s;euenteenth booke of Ammianus Marcellinus. This Oracle, although it was of all heathen nations far and nere round about, had in great reuerence, and held for mo&s;t certaine and true: yet Strabo the famous Geographer, who liued in the daies of Tiberius Cae&s;ar, at &s;uch time as Chri&s;tian religion began more cleerely to &s;hine forth; and Plutarch, who liued in the time of Traiane the Emperour, do iointly and plainly te&s;tifie, that in their times it was very much neglected. Prudentius, the Chri&s;tian poet, who wrot about the reigne of Theodo&s;ius, iu&s;tifieth the &s;ame in this his ver&s;e: <HI>Nec re&s;pon&s;a refert Libycis in &s;yrtibus Ammon:</HI> God Ammon on the Libyan &s;ands, now an&s;wer'th no demands at all. In the daies of Iu&s;tinian, it &s;eemeth by Procopius in the &s;ixth booke <HI>Aedificior.</HI> that it was altogether de&s;ert and vnfrequented. Whether this be that &s;ame place which is de&s;cribed by Clemens Alexandrinus in his Stromaton, and by Eu&s;ebius in his booke <HI>De praeparat. Euangel.</HI> vnder the name of <HI>Gerandryus,</HI> placed by them in the&s;e &s;ands, I would gladly learne of tho&s;e that are more learned than my &s;elfe. About this Oracle which we haue hitherto de&s;cribed, there is on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, a fore&s;t or groue, Curtius calleth it <HI>nemus,</HI> Solinus, <HI>lucus:</HI> but Diodorus &s;aith it is a chappel: <HI>templum.</HI> within which there is <HI>Aqua Solis,</HI> or, as others terme it <HI>Fons Solis,</HI> the fountaine of the Sunne: who&s;e water is, as Ouid writeth, at noone as cold as &s;tone, at eeuen and morne as hot as heat of Sun. This fountaine is thus de&s;cribed by Pomponius Mela: This fountaine, &s;aith he, a&s;&s;oone as any man &s;hall but touch it with his hand, it pre|&s;ently beginneth to &s;well, and &s;o to to&s;&s;e vp the &s;and and to ri&s;e in great billowes like vnto the maine &s;ea in tempe&s;tuous weather. At mid-night it boileth: by and by, it beginneth by a little and little to coole, vntill at length about the breake of day it becommeth key-cold: Then as the Sunne ari&s;eth, &s;o it waxeth by degrees colder and colder, vntill at noone it becommeth as cold almo&s;t as ice. After noone it beginneth againe to waxe warme, and at night it becommeth very hote; and &s;o as the night pa&s;&s;eth it groweth &s;till hotter and hotter, vntill at la&s;t about midnight it become almo&s;t &s;calding hot. The very &s;ame doth Curtius, Diodorus, Herodotus, Pliny, and Lucretius write of this fountaine. The &s;ame Lucretius in his &s;ixth booke doth yeeld the rea&s;on of this &s;trange miracle. Item, S. Augu&s;tine and Solinus doe &s;peake the like almo&s;t word for word of it. But Solinus and al&s;o I&s;idorus do make mention of another &s;pring not far from th s place: who&s;e water, as they &s;ay, doth binde toge|ther the du&s;t and clods, and pre&s;ently turneth embers &amp; a&s;hes into firme ground and &s;olide turffe: Or as Lucane in his ninth booke writeth, <HI>Qui putria terrae alligat, &amp; do|mitas vnda connectit arenas:</HI> which rotteth and turneth all things to fertile &s;olid ground: and &s;cattering &s;ands in ma&s;&s;ie lumps of &s;tone it tieth. Againe Antonius Liberalis maketh mention of another &s;pring, which he &s;aith, at Sun&s;et doth congeale and as the Sunne commeth toward it againe doth &s;tand &s;t ll. Item Pliny telleth of another &s;pring in the country of the Troglodites, a people nere inhabiting to this place, which about noone is &s;weet and coole, but at midnight it boileth &amp; groweth to be very bitter. I will &s;urcea&s;e to &s;peake any one word more of the&s;e things, after that I haue added that which I haue read in a certaine epi&s;tle of Syne&s;ius, vnto his friend Euopti|us, of the inhabitants and people dwelling nere this temple of Ammon, namely that the women haue heere &s;uch great paps, that they do not giue their children &s;ucke as heere they v&s;e, but do ca&s;t their brea&s;ts ouer their &s;houlders and do giue them &s;ucke behind their backs. And le&s;t any man &s;hould doubt of the truth heerof, hear &s;ee what Iuuenall writeth of the &s;ame in his Satyres; <HI>In Meroe~ cra&s;&s;o maiorem infante mamillam.</HI> In Mero&euml; the teat oft times is found much bigger than the &s;ucking child. Thus much therefore of the Oracle of Iupiter Ammon, and the fountaine of the Sunne. In the 30. chapter of the booke of Iob, in the originall text <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Hamma</HI> is v&s;ed of the Holy gho&s;t for the Hebrew <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Semes,</HI> the Sunne, which in the 19. P&s;alme doth &s;ignifie drought or a parching heat, &s;uch as is in tho&s;e countries nere the tropicks of the Sunne: Item <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Hamam,</HI> in the Arabicke tongue &s;ignifieth an hot bath, &s;uch as this fountaine is, by the authority of many authors de&s;cribed to be. Why then may we not &s;ay (a&s;well for that this Oracle or temple was built neere vnto this fountaine, as al&s;o for the ioy and comfort, as is &s;aid before, that Bacchus and his con&s;orts enioied by meanes of the &s;ame) that this god and his temple tooke the name of Ammon, not of the Sand, but of the Sunne <HI>(Hamma)</HI> whereof the well or &s;pring did beare the name; or otherwi&s;e of <HI>Hammam,</HI> a bath? Surely the analogy is proper, and in regard of the affinity of the languages, by ods the etymology more pro|bable. For I cannot ea&s;ily be per&s;waded that the names of places heere were fetched from Greece. But of this argument we &s;hall haue occa&s;ion, God willing, offered to &s;peake more fitly and more co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">ou&s;ly. Pau&s;anias in his Eliaca, among&s;t the godde&s;&s;es of Libya, reckoneth vp <HI>Iuno Ammonia,</HI> which was wor&s;hipped in her haire, but this is be&s;ide our purpo&s;e. It remaineth onely that we &s;peake a word or two of <HI>Memnon,</HI> which, Quintus Curtius reporteth, Alexande had al&s;o a great de&s;ire to &s;ee. In

<PB REF="311"> the 4. booke of Quintus Curtius you &s;hall find the&s;e words &s;poken of Alexander. He had an earne&s;t de&s;ire (and not without great rea&s;on although there were al&s;o &s;ome rea&s;ons to the contrary) to &s;ee not only the high country of Egypt, but euen Ethiopia it &s;elfe. The &s;tately pallace of king Memnon and Thiton, famous for the great antiqury o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">, did force him to venture that way almo&s;t beyond the tropicke of Cancer. Thus farre Curtius. Strabo, Solinus and Pliny, in the fifth booke of his hi&s;to|ry of Nature, doe de&s;cribe this palace of Memnon to haue beene in the city Abydus. Yet the &s;ame Pliny in his 36. booke writeth that it was in Thebes which opinion Pau&s;anias and Diony&s;ius Afer doe confirme to be true. But heere by Thebes I vnder&s;tand Thebais, or the country of Thebae: for both Thebae and Abydus, were ci|ties of this prouince. In this palace was the image or &s;tatue of the &s;aid Memnon, as Pliny calleth it: Strabo &s;aith it was a Colo&s;&s;us: and Tacitus termeth it <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">xiam offigi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">a,</HI> a counterfet cut in &s;tone. For, as Strabo te&s;tifieth, it was made of one &s;olide &s;tone: of colour blacke, as Philo&s;tratus affirmeth: or red, as Tzetzes, I know not vpon what ground and authority, would make vs beleeue. Pau&s;anias and Philo&s;tratus doe write, that it was the image of a king &s;itting in his chaire of e&s;tate. Moreouer the &s;ame Philo&s;tratus &s;aith that it did repre&s;ent the forme of a beardle&s;&s;e yong man. Strabo recordeth that in his time he &s;aw the vpper part of this image broken off aboue the &s;eat vpon which it was placed. Which Pau&s;anias al&s;o doth te&s;tifie to be true, affirming that he him&s;elfe had &s;eene the &s;ame. the other part, he &s;aith, is yet to be &s;eene &s;itting. Philo&s;tratus writeth that it re&s;teth it &s;elfe, or lying groueling vpon the hands, &amp; beareth the &s;hape of a man that would willingly rai&s;e him&s;elfe being downe. This image, all the forenamed authors do affirme, euery day at &s;un ri&s;ing (and, as Philo&s;tratus reporteth, as long as the &s;un beames touched the &s;ame) did make a noi&s;e at the mouth, much like to the &s;ound of an harpe; which is al&s;o auouched by Pau&s;anias: although we are not ignorant that Tacitus writeth that it did &s;peake and counterfet the voice of man. Pliny &s;aith that it did but crackle. It is apparent that Lucian doth but &s;coffe and ie&s;t, (which is an ordinary thing in him) when as he writeth that hee heard th s image &s;peake, and that not after a vulgar maner making a fooli&s;h and vaine babling, but to vtter an oracle in meter of 7 ver&s;es long. I do in like maner hold that of Tzetzes, in 64. &s;ection of his 6. Chiliade (as al&s;o many other things in him in other places) to be but a meere fable, when as he reporteth, that this image in the day time did v&s;ually &s;ing a plea&s;ant &s;ong, but in the night a very mournfull and lamentable dittie. Peraduenture he had this from Calli&s;tus, who writeth that this image when the Sun came toward it, did make a plea&s;ant noi&s;e, but when it went from it, it made a heauy and &s;orrowfull &s;ound. But of this noi&s;e or &s;ound let vs heare Strabo, a graue authour, a man of great credit and a diligent ob&s;eruer of this &s;trange woonder: I my &s;elfe, &s;aith he, was pre&s;ent with Aelius Gallus, together with a great mul|titude of his friends and &s;ouldiers that were with him, about one of the clocke in the day, and I heard a &s;ound, but whether it came from the ba&s;is, or from the colo&s;ies, or image it &s;elfe, or from &s;ome of tho&s;e that &s;tood about it, I was not able to di&s;cerne, nor dare not for truth affirme: &s;eeing that by rea&s;on of the vncerainty of the cau&s;e, I had rather &s;u&s;pect any thing, than to beleeue and teach that &s;tones laid and ioined together in that maner &s;hould make a &s;ound Eu&s;tathius vpon Diony&s;ius Aier doth ob&s;erue that this was ordinarily done by a kind of in&s;trument: but I dare not giue much credit vnto him, who is oft times him&s;elfe too light of beliefe. Pau&s;anias writeth that the Thebenes do flatly denie this to be the &s;tatue or image of Memnon the Aethiopian, but to be indeed the counterfet of Phanemophes, a natural Egyp|tian borne. Item, that the heard &s;ay of &s;ome that it was the image of Se&s;o&s;tris. Strabo writeth that there be &s;ome which thinke Memnon to haue beene called of the E|gyptians I&s;mandes. Dion Pru&s;aeus in his 31. oration writeth that it had no maner of in&s;cription or letters written about it at all. But it &s;eemeth to haue beene the &s;tatue of Memnon, in regard that Heliodorus, among&s;t the gods, wor&s;hipped by the Ethiopians, doth al&s;o reckon Memnon for one. Mention is in like maner made of this image in that ver&s;e of Iuuenall: <HI>Diminio magicae re&s;onant vbi M-mnone chordae;</HI> Where curtall'd Memnons harpe, by magicke skill, with mu&s;icke &s;weet and warbling &s;ound the eares doth fill. <HI>Dimidium,</HI> curtall'd, hee calleth it, as I thinke, becau&s;e the vpper part, as wee heard before, was broken off from the re&s;t of the body, which Pau|&s;anius &s;aieth vpon Cambyles: but Strabo rather thinketh it to be done by an earthquake. Vpon the forenamed ver&s;e of Iuuenall, an ancient glo&s;&s;e writeth thus, (I deli|uer it for no truth; only take it as it is, corrupt and fal&s;e) The &s;tatue, &s;aith he, of Memnon, made of bra&s;&s;e, holding an harpe in his hands, at certaine houres made a plea|&s;ant &s;ound. This king Caubis (Cambyles, I thinke he meaneth) cau&s;&s;ed to be broken vp, &s;uppo&s;ing that there had beene within it &s;ome engine or mechanicall auto|maton, that had made this &s;ound yet notwith&s;tanding the &s;tatue which had beene made and con&s;ecrated by art magicke, after it had beene opened, did &s;till at certain times make a noice as afore. But the&s;e are meere fooleries: as al&s;o the&s;e following are, out of another ancient interpreter of the &s;ame poet, as they are alleadged by Ia|nus Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> in his commentaries vpon Catullus; namely, that this &s;tatue or image did v&s;uallie in plaine words &s;alute both the Sunne and the King: but after that Cam|by&s;es had broken or cut off a peece of it, it &s;aluted the Sunne onely, but not the King. The Chronicle of Eu&s;ebius relateth, from the opinion of the common people, th t it &s;pake vntill the comming of our Sauiour Chri&s;t. And thus much of this &s;tatue of Memnon, which Curtius &s;aith Alexander had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee: the rea&s;on of who&s;e &s;trange miracle, Tacitus reporteth, Germanicus Cae&s;ar did much labour to conceiue: and which, Spartianus te&s;tifieth, Septimius Seuerus the Emperour did verie diligently view, and behold with great admiration.</P>
<P>By that de&s;cription of Iupiter Ammon in Curtius, it &s;eemeth that he meant to expre&s;&s;e vnto vs two formes of it: viz. one which was accounted to bee his image or counterfet, the other was that which was wor&s;hipped for a god: that had the &s;hape of a ramme, this the forme of a bo&s;&s;e <HI>(vmbilicus)</HI> For I vnder&s;tand by the word <HI>vm|bilicus,</HI> any high thing that &s;teeketh out (as the nauil in a man) in maner of a pyramis, or conus round or &s;quare: Like as in books almo&s;t fini&s;hed, as Porphyrius te&s;tifieth, they ordinarily v&s;ed to doe either for ornament or &s;ome &s;peciall purpo&s;e; yea and yet to this day &s;till they are put vpon the out&s;ide in forme of a round globe. For men of ancient families were wont, as we do gather by many circum&s;tances, oft times in this rude manner to point at their gods, rather then truely to expre&s;&s;e them in their true forme and proportion. In the temple of Delphos, as Strabo in the 6. booke of his Geography reporteth, there was a bo&s;&s;e pre&s;erued, curiou&s;ly lapped vp in skarfes and ribbends, to demon&s;trate and &s;hew vnto the world, that this place was in <HI>Vmbilico,</HI> that is, in the midde&s;t or center of the whole earth: and it was made, as Pau&s;anias writeth, of pure white marble. For the &s;tatue or image of the godde&s;&s;e Venus, which was to be &s;eene at Paphus in Cyprus, as Tacitus reporteth, was a continuall cir|cle, broad at the bottome, with a thinne edge or brim, ri&s;ing vp narrower and narrower by degrees, in manner of a pyrarnis. Maximus Tyrius in his 38. oration &s;pea|keth the &s;ame of it, almo&s;t word for word: but that he &s;aith it was like a white pyramis. The &s;ame authour in the &s;ame place writeth, that the Arabians portraitured their god in forme of a &s;quare or cubicall &s;tone: and as Suidas affirmeth, it had no manner of carued worke vpon it at all. But this he &s;peaketh of the Arabians of Pe|tiaea, and withall addeth that this their god is called Mars. Minutius Felix maketh the &s;ame god to be but a rough &s;tone, vnhew'd or vnpoli&s;h't. Liuy al&s;o te&s;tifieth that the Pe&s;&s;inuntij, a people in Phrygia, did honour a &s;tone for the mother of the gods. Arnobius in his 6. booke &s;aith that it was a flint &s;tone, of no great bigne&s;&s;e, of co|lour blacke or very darke and duski&s;h, verie craggy, rough and vneuen. Prudentius al&s;o in his 7. booke &s;aith, that it was of colour browne or inclining to blacke. He|rodianus reporteth almo&s;t the &s;ame of the forme of the &s;tatue of the Sunne or Elagabalus, that Quintus Curtius doth of his god Ammon: The&s;e are his words as you may read in his 5. booke: They haue no image carued and made by arte of man, after the manner of the Greekes or Romanes, to expre&s;&s;e the &s;imilitude of that god: But there is a very great &s;tone, round at the bottome, and tapred vpward almo&s;t in manner of that Geometricall body which the Mathematicians do call <HI>Conus.</HI> The Sicyonij, citizens of Sicyona city in Peloponne&s;us in Greece, as Pau&s;anias writeth, did make their Iupiter Milichius in forme of a pyramis or taper. The Semni, a &s;ect of Philo&s;ophers in India, as Clemens Alexandrinus reporteth, did adore and do religious &s;eruice to a pyramis. Hither peraduenture that &s;igne of the profane Sa|crament mentioned by Firmicus, is to be referred. Yea and the Romanes them&s;elues vnder this forenamed figure doubtle&s;&s;e did meane to expre&s;&s;e &s;ome god or other, as appeareth by that &s;caffold or chaire, de&s;cribed by the fore&s;aid Herodian, made in manner of a turret or lanterne, in which their Emperours were crowned and en|&s;talled, and was indeed of them enrowled among&s;t the number of their gods or &s;aints as you plea&s;e to terme them. For this al&s;o was &s;o built that it did ri&s;e from the bottome vpward le&s;&s;e &amp; le&s;&s;e by degrees, vntil at length it came to the highe&s;t &amp; la&s;t roome, which was the lea&s;t and narrowe&s;t of all. Hither al&s;o are to be referred tho&s;e obeliskes or pyramides of the Egyptians, built in forme not much vnlike tho&s;e <HI>Vmbilici,</HI> before mentioned, dedicated al&s;o to the Sunne. Item tho&s;e &s;pires <HI>(metae)</HI> in the theaters dedicated to the Dio&s;curi or Tyndarides. The fire (which &s;ignifieth the godde&s;&s;e <HI>Ve&s;ta,</HI> <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>E&s;ta,</HI> the Chaldees call the fire) al&s;o was expre&s;&s;ed in this forme, who&s;e temple was built round, and tapered vpward. All which do come very neere to the forme of a bo&s;&s;e <HI>(Vmbilicus)</HI> or that Geometricall body called by them <HI>Conus.</HI> Out of the&s;e I gather that the ancient reading in the old imprinted copies of Quintus Curtius, which haue <HI>Vmbilico &s;imilis,</HI> like a bo&s;&s;e, is much better and more probable, than that late edition &s;et out the other day by a learned man, which readeth, <HI>Vmbilico tenus arieti &s;imilis,</HI> to the nauill like a ramme. But all the&s;e will appeare more plaine and cleare to the reader by the compari&s;on of certaine monies and coines, as may be &s;eene in tho&s;e authours which haue of purpo&s;e written of the ancient Romane coines. Moreouer certaine nations al&s;o (although this be not altogether to our purpo&s;e, yet I take it not ami&s;&s;e to adde a word or two of it, by the way) were woont to attribute no great beauty to their gods. For Arnobius writeth that the Scythians for the &s;igne or idol of their god did v&s;e a skene or &s;hort &s;word. The The|&s;pij, citizens of The&s;pia, a city in Boetia in Greece, did adore and do diuine honour to a bough of Progne: The Romanes for Quirinus (or Romulus, as &s;ome thinke) to a &s;peare. The Samij did reuerence a well for Iuno: and the Carij, a rough and vnhewed peece of timber, for Diana. Pau&s;anias witne&s;&s;eth that the Sicyonij honou|red Diana Paetroa, vnder the forme of a columne or rude pillar rough and vnpoli&s;hed. Maximus Tyrius reporteth that the Celtae did do reuerence to a very high oke as vnto the &s;igne or image of mighty Ioue. The &s;ame authour te&s;tifieth that the Paeones for the Sunne, did diuine honour to a little di&s;h or platter put vpon the toppe of a long pole. Tertullian telleth vs that Pallas Attica, and Ceres Farrea were put vpon the end of an ill-fauor'd pole, rugged &s;take or rough peece of wood. Faria, or Pharia, which Lip&s;ius liketh better, to whom al&s;o I a&s;&s;ent, for that in a certaine coine which Antonius Augu&s;tinus &s;etteth out in his Dialogues, together with the image and picture of this godde&s;&s;e, there is this in&s;cription ISIS PHARIA. &s;eeing that al&s;o as Herodotus and Plutarch doe te&s;tifie, that this &s;ame godde&s;&s;e is the &s;ame that I&s;is, which is wor&s;hipped of the Egyptian, is: item that I&s;is is the &s;ame that Dea Pe&s;&s;inuntia is, and this the &s;ame that Cybele. So that <HI>Pharia,</HI> as he would haue it, &s;hould be the &s;ame with <HI>Aegyptia,</HI> vnder&s;tanding thereby I&s;is of Aegypt. Moreouer Minutius Felix maketh mention of Pharia I&s;is. Pau&s;anias in his Achaica writeth that in times pa&s;t it was an ordinary thing generally practi&s;ed by all the Grecians to wor&s;hip rude and vnpoli&s;hed &s;tones for their gods. Item, Herodotus in Clio doth writne&s;&s;e that the Per&s;ians were not woont to make any images, to reare any temples or to build any altars to their gods. We read al&s;o that it was the cu&s;tome of &s;ome nations ne|uer to make any image, portraitures or pictures of their gods at all. For Tacitus writeth that the Syrians neuer made any &s;imilitude or temple to their god Carmel, only they built him an altar, and did adore him with a religious wor&s;hip. The &s;ame authour &s;aith, That the Germanes did make no &s;imilitudes of their gods: nor did euer attribute vnto them the &s;hape and feature of any mortall man: and moreouer he addeth, that they did &s;ee them onely in their deuotions. Strabo &s;aith that the Per&s;ians did neither erect images nor altars to their gods. Silius Italicus &s;peaketh thus of the chappell of Hercules at Caliz: <HI>Sed nulla effigies, &s;imulacr&aacute;ue nota Deorum, Ma|ie&s;t ite locum &amp; &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ro impleuere timore.</HI> Yea and the Romanes them&s;elues, as Varro telleth the tale, for more then an hundred and fifty yeares together, did wor&s;hip their gods without any images or idols at all. And indeed Pliny plainly affirmeth, that it is the weakene&s;&s;e of mans nature to &s;eeke for any &s;imilitudes or counterfets of them. But becau&s;e there is nothing more ab&s;olute and perfect than God, it is very probable that the Gentiles did reuerence him vnder that forme, wherewith in all their acti|ons, when they come to perfection, they are ordinarily beautified, as with a mo&s;t rich and co&s;tly ornament. Why they v&s;ed to carrie this god Ammon in a boate or pinnace, peraduenture we may vnder&s;tand by that of Cornelius Tacitus: where he teacheth that the Sueui were woont to make the image of I&s;is in manner of a &s;mall barke or pinnace: thereby to &s;hew that their religion and manner of &s;eruice of their gods v&s;ed by them, was brought from beyond the &s;ea from forrein countries. Pau&s;anias hath left recorded that the Cyreneans did at Delphos dedicate their God Ammon &s;itting in a waggon [<HI>Vehiculum,</HI> the interpreter calleth.] <HI>Sic bona po&s;teritas</HI> [Romana &s;cilicet] <HI>Puppim formauit in aere, Ho&s;pitis aduentum te&s;tificata Dei.</HI> So Romanes old for loue did make This &s;hippe, of pure&s;t bra&s;&s;e, To te&s;tifie that this their god A farre borne &s;tranger was: this Ouid in this fir&s;t booke of his <HI>Fa&s;ti,</HI> &s;peaketh of the Romane god Ianus. So that what the Romanes meant by this their &s;hippe, <HI>[puppis]</HI> that they meant by their pinnace or wagon <HI>[nauigium,</HI> or <HI>vehiculum.]</HI> Moreouer, among&s;t the Germanes al&s;o in an iland of the maine &s;ea, as Tacitus te&s;tifieth, there was a place which he calleth <HI>Ca&s;tum nemus,</HI> in which there was a waggon con&s;ecrated and &s;anctified, couered ouer with a cloth, and adored as a &s;aint. But peraduenture we haue beene too tedious in this argument.</P>
<P>As we haue out of old and ancient hi&s;tories laid downe two diuers and &s;undry formes of this god Ammon; &s;o out of the &s;ame it is very probable that hee had two diuers temples: For Diodorus in his &s;euenteenth booke in the de&s;cription of this temple, doth &s;ay that it was built by Danaus the Egyptian. And the &s;ame authour a|gaine, in his fir&s;t booke &s;aith, that Ofiris al&s;o erected a temple for Iupiter Ammon, in Thebes a city in Egypt: which was all of beaten gold, cleane contrary to that which we haue de&s;cribed before, as appeareth out of the&s;e ver&s;es of Lucane in his 9. booke: <HI>Non illic libyeae po&s;uerunt ditia gentes Templa, nec Eois &s;plendent donariagemmis.</HI> In E|gypt it was, not in Libya, as is manife&s;t out of the &s;econd booke of Herodotus. Where you &s;hall find this de&s;cription of it; Iupiter being not willing that Hercules, who came to vi&s;it him, &s;hould &s;ee him, yet at length by importunity being ouercome, v&s;ed this deuice to deceiue him; He tooke a ram, flead him and cut off his head: this fell, with the head, wool and all, he put vpon him, and thus &s;heweth him&s;elfe to Hercules. Wherupon the Egyptians haue decreed to make the image of Iupiter and to picture him with a rammes head. For him euery yeare, vpon a certaine day, they kill a ramme in like manner as before is &s;hewed, and the skinne they put ouer the image of the &s;aid &amp;c. And becau&s;e the temple of this god Ammon was in the city Thebes, which thereupon is of good writers called <HI>Dio&s;polis,</HI> that is, Ioues towne; I was of o|pinion that the Holy &s;cripture did al&s;o in &s;ome place or other &s;peake of it. And indeed in the thirtieth chapter of Ezechiel the &s;eptuagints for the Hebrew <HI>No,</HI> haue <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;polu.</HI> and againe in the third chapter of Naum, for No Amon, they haue <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. It is very probable therefore that Amon (<GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, <HI>Hamon,</HI> which in the Hebrew tongue &s;ignifieth a multitude) was the proper name of this place.</P>

Therefore it is to be thought that the Poet fained this of his owne head, or els &s;pake it in loue and commendations of this riuer. Neither was it a voyage of &s;euen yeeres, but of two at the mo&s;t, as <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;eus</HI> doth plainly affirme: <HI>Solinus</HI> out of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius Hemina</HI> auoucheth the &s;ame. There are &s;ome, as <HI>Strabo</HI> in the thirteenth booke of his Geography witne&s;&s;eth, which do thinke all this voyage to be a fained tale and fiction of the Poets: and that <HI>Aeneas</HI> &s;tayed &s;till in <HI>Troy,</HI> and &s;ucceeded in the kingdome after his father, as likewi&s;e his childrens children did after him for many generations. Of this opinion <HI>Homer</HI> doth &s;eeme to be. <HI>Xenophon</HI> in his booke of hunting, telleth this tale another way, where he writeth, That <HI>Aeneas</HI> manfully defending his father, and carefully pre&s;eruing the gods of his father and mother, gat him&s;elfe a great reputation and credit amongst all &s;orts of men, for that his piety and religion; in&s;omuch that euen the very enemies them&s;elues, granted to him only, aboue all other which they had taken captiue in the &s;urprizing of <HI>Troy,</HI> that in the &s;acking of the &s;ame no man &s;hould &s;poile or lay hand of ought that was his. Moreouer, that that his voyage vnto <HI>Carthage</HI> is not mentioned by any approoued hi&s;torian, but fained by the poet, <HI>Macrobius</HI> doth plainly teach. Item, <HI>Appian,</HI> a writer of good credit, doth much di&s;credit that &s;tory of his meeting and communication with Queene <HI>Dido,</HI> who writeth that <HI>CARTHAGE</HI> was built by the &s;ame <HI>Dido</HI> fiue hundred yeeres before the de&s;truction of <HI>Troy.</HI> Againe, the graue hi&s;toriographer <HI>Trogus,</HI> in his eighteenth booke doth make a relation of the life and death of this <HI>Dido</HI> or <HI>Eliza</HI> farre different from this. But the poet, as it &s;eemeth, had a purpo&s;e to di&s;grace this citie and to &s;trike a deepe impre&s;&s;ion of the fatall hatred which it alwayes bare towards the Romans, like as long before, <HI>Homer</HI> vnder the per&s;on of <HI>Helen</HI> had &s;hewed how much the Greeks in heart did malice the Troians. Whereupon not vnfitly, I thinke, this Epigram of <HI>Au&s;onius</HI> which he wrote vpon the counterfet or picture of Queene <HI>Dido</HI> may heere to tho&s;e former be adioined: <HI>Illa ego &s;um</HI> Dido <HI>vultu, quam con&s;picis ho&s;pes, A&s;&s;imulata modis pulchra&abque; miri|ficis. Talis eram, fed non, Maro quam mihi finxit, erat mens: Vita nec ince&s;tis laeta cupidinibus. Nam&abque; nec</HI> Aeneas <HI>vidit me</HI> Troius <HI>vnquam: Nec Libyam aduenit cla&s;&s;ibus Iliacis. Sed furias fugiens, atque arma procacis Iarbae, Seruaui, fateor, morte pudicitiam, Pectore transfixo: ca&s;tos quod pertulit en&s;es.

<HEAD>The PEREGRINATION of VLYSSES.</HEAD>
<P>_THe manifold wandring voiages of Vly&s;&s;es (<HI>Errores,</HI> Au&s;onius in diuers places calleth them) were from all antiquity &s;o fa|mous and renowmed amongst all men, that <HI>The Peregrination of Vly&s;&s;es,</HI> grew into a by-word, and to be &s;poken prouerbially of any hard and difficult trauell that any man did vndergoe, as Apuleius, in the &s;econd booke of his Golden A&s;&s;e, doth te&s;tifie. Therefore for the benefite of the Readers and Students of that hi&s;tory, and at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of &s;undrie learned men, my friends, I haue thought good out of ancient Hi&s;torians, to de&s;cribe the <HI>twenty voyages</HI> of this famous Captaine, who, as Tzetzes writeth, with <HI>twelue &s;hippes,</HI> &s;et forward from <HI>TROY,</HI> (or, as the Greekes call it, <HI>Ilium,</HI>) a city of Troia or Troas, a prouince of A&s;ia Minor, continually wandring vp and downe vntill at la&s;t he came to <HI>ITHACA,</HI> an iland in the Ionian &s;ea, where hee was borne, now called, as Sophianus and others do te&s;tifie, <HI>Valle di Compare,</HI> or <HI>Teachi,</HI> as Porcacchius affirmeth; but of the Turkes <HI>Phiachi,</HI> as Leunclaw witne&s;&s;eth. Therefore after the tenne yeares &s;iege, taking and &s;acking of Troy by the Greekes, <HI>Vly&s;&s;es</HI> or <HI>Ody&s;&s;eus</HI> as they call him, hauing a pur|po&s;e to returne home to his owne country, &s;hipped him&s;elfe and his company, put foorth to &s;ea, and arriued within a few daies vpon the coa&s;t of the <HI>CICONES,</HI> a people of Thracia in Europe, who&s;e chiefe city <HI>ISMARVS, (Zimarus,</HI> Dictys Creten&s;is fal&s;ly calleth it) hee &s;acked and &s;poiled. This city, as Suidas, He&s;ychius, and Tzetzes do te&s;tifie, was called <HI>MARONEA,</HI> now <HI>Marogna,</HI> as Sophianus and Niger both do peremptorily affirm, or, <HI>Marolia,</HI> as Leunclaw writeth. In Hyginus fables it is fal&s;ly written <HI>Marathonia.</HI> And that it &s;hould be amended &amp; written Ma|ronea, it is very manife&s;t, for that the wine wherewithall Vly&s;&s;es afterward made the great lubber Polyphemus drunk was fetched from hence, as hee there writeth, and which Euripides in his Cyclops doth iu&s;tifie to be true. Moreouer <HI>Vinum Maroneum,</HI> the wine of Maronea, hath beene in old time much e&s;teemed of and was as famous as any other &s;ort what&s;oeuer. Therefore after the &s;acke of this city, and as Suidas reporteth, Hecuba, ending her daies, neere the &s;ea, being there intombed in &s;tone in a place commonly called by the name of <HI>CYNOSSEMA,</HI> he was a&s;&s;aulted by the Cicones a &s;turdy and rough kind of people inhabiting amongst the mountaines of Thrace; and &s;o by that meanes was forced with great lo&s;&s;e and &s;laughter of his men to hor&s;e &s;aile and put off to &s;ea againe. And directing his cour&s;e toward <HI>MALEA, (Cabo Malio,</HI> or <HI>S. Michaels wings)</HI> a promontory or foreland of Peloponne&s;us, the weather growing very foule, he was &s;ore troubled and his &s;hips rent and torne mo&s;t grieuou&s;ly, as Homer te&s;tifieth. But first it is very probable that he put into <HI>DELOS (Sdiles)</HI> an iland in the Archipelago, lying directly in his way, and where they write, that before the altar of Apollo, Vly&s;&s;es &s;aw a tall and &s;lender <HI>Palme-tree</HI> grow: which, Cicero in his booke of Lawes affirmeth, was &s;till to be &s;eene in his time: and it is likely was the very &s;ame, which Pliny reporteth in his time had remained from the daies of Apollo. Homer al&s;o and Pau&s;anias do &s;peake of this palme tree. From <HI>Malea,</HI> he came to the ile <HI>CYTHERA (Cerigo)</HI> in the Ionian &s;ea not farre from the coa&s;t of Peloponne&s;us, and from thence he went to the <HI>LOTOPHAGI.</HI> The <HI>Lotophagi,</HI> a kind of people which liue e&s;pecially by the fruit of the lote tree, are by Hi&s;toriographers placed in Africa, yea and that heere and there in diuer&s;e and &s;un|dry places of the &s;ame. But tho&s;e Lotophagi vnto whom the con&s;orts of this our Vly&s;&s;es came, I am of opinion with I&s;aac Tzetzes, that they dwelt neere <HI>Hyperia,</HI> a city of Sicilia, or were next neighbours to <HI>Camarina,</HI> a city there &s;till knowen by the name of Camarana. Neither can I bee per&s;waded that the&s;e Lotophagi are to be &s;ought for in Africa: &s;eeing that it is apparant euen out of Homer him&s;elfe that the next day they went from the Lotophagi vnto the <HI>CYCLOPES,</HI> which out of Africa, &s;o farre remote from Sicilia, they could by no meanes haue done. Item I haue Au&s;onius in his Periocha, vpon my &s;ide, who there te&s;tifieth that the&s;e Lotophagi did butte vpon the ile of the Cyclopes. Now almo&s;t all authours which haue written of this argu|ment do iointly affirme that &s;ome of his con&s;orts, much delighted with the &s;weetne&s;&s;e and plea&s;ant ta&s;te of the fruit of the Lote tree, &s;taied heere &s;till and would by no meanes euer returne backe againe. This I thought good, gentle Reader, to admoni&s;h thee of, le&s;t thou &s;houlde&s;t in vaine in this our Mappe thinke to find any part of the continent of Africa. Moreouer in Pau&s;anias I reade, that Vly&s;&s;es in this his iourney did build the <HI>ATHFNEVM,</HI> that is, the chapell of Minerua, in Arcadia. From <HI>Cythera,</HI> he went to <HI>CACRA,</HI> a porte towne of Sicilia, which the forenamed Tzetzes te&s;tifieth was of him afterward named <HI>Vly&s;&s;is portus,</HI> Vly&s;&s;es hauen, and had beene al&s;o &s;ometime called <HI>Engyon,</HI> now knowen by the name of <HI>Longina.</HI> From hence hee went to the <HI>ILE</HI> of the Cyclopes, and &s;o to the <HI>CAVE</HI> of Polyphemus; where he offered &s;acrifice and performed all due religious ceremonies vnto the gods, as Athenaeus te&s;tifieth. Now this <HI>Caue,</HI> as Vibius Seque&s;ter &s;heweth, was vpon the brinke of the riuer Acis, now called <HI>Freddo.</HI> Heere making Polyphemus drunke with the forenamed Maronean wine, and putting out his eies, he went vnto the <HI>AEOLIAE,</HI> or, as the Gods call them, the <HI>Planetae,</HI> certaine ilands continually ca&s;ting foorth &s;parkles and flames of fire. Heere of Aeolus, king of the&s;e ilands, he had giuen him a bottle or bagge made of an oxe skin, wherein all the winds, but Zephyrus the We&s;t wind (or, if we may giue credit to Agatharchides, none but the North and South windes onely) were conteined and enclo&s;ed. For the We&s;t wind for tho&s;e that &s;aile with a &s;trait cour&s;e from Sicilia to Ithaca, is the be&s;t that can blow. With this pro|&s;perous gale of wind, in nine daies, as Ouid reporteth, they comming within &s;ight and kenning of the ile Ithaca, while Vly&s;&s;es was a&s;leepe, his con&s;orts vp|on the tenth day, as the fore&s;aid authour writeth, opened the bagge, which they had alwaies hitherto beene verily per&s;waded was full of gold and &s;iluer. By this meanes contrary winds and &s;tormes ari&s;ing, they are forced backe againe, and redoubling their cour&s;e, (yet an ancient Lyricall Poet, &s;aith it was but the bottle that went backe againe) to come the &s;econd time to the <HI>AEOLIAN ILANDS:</HI> where being by Aelous, as contemners of the Gods, and skorners of all religion, for bidden to land, they came vnto the <HI>LAESTRYGONES,</HI> a &s;auage people, that v&s;ed to eat men, (like as they now write of the Canibals of America) who &s;et vpon them, as enemies, neere to the city <HI>Lamus,</HI> and the fountaine <HI>Artacia.</HI> From hence with one &s;hip onely (the other e|leuen, as Ouid and Au&s;onius do te&s;tifie, being &s;unke by the Lae&s;trygones) he came vnto the ile <HI>AE AE AE,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Circeia,</HI> (Hyginus in his fables doth fal&s;ly call <HI>Aena</HI>) the place of abode, where <HI>Circes,</HI> (called after her death, as Lactantius writeth, <HI>Marica</HI>) the daughter of Sol, or the Sunne, a woman famous for her Sorcery, pa&s;&s;ing skilfull in all maner of Magicke and witchcraft: by who&s;e conduct and direction he went to <HI>AVERNVM,</HI> (Ce|drenus nameth it <HI>Neciopa</HI>) a lake in Italy now called <HI>Lago di Tripergola;</HI> where amongst the &s;oules that are in Purgatory <HI>(apud Inferos)</HI> hee hath conference with his mother Anticlia, and of her and by her meanes he vnder&s;tood many things concerning his iourney that now he was to take. This done comming backe againe to <HI>Circeia,</HI> he found Elpenor one of his con&s;orts whom he had left with Circes, as al&s;o Tire&s;ias the wi&s;ard or &s;ooth-&s;aier, with di|uer&s;e other worthies and braue men, dead and buried. From thence he returned to the <HI>SVPERI,</HI> and entred there the <HI>Ocean.</HI> La&s;tly, he made a fu|nerall and performed all ceremonies as he had promi&s;ed to do, for his friend Elpenor, and withall built him a &s;tately tombe. And thus much of that mat|ter. Of this his nauigation through the va&s;t Ocean, although many things by diuers authors are diuer&s;lie reported: (as of <HI>Vly&s;&s;ea,</HI> and <HI>Vly&s;&s;ipona,</HI> certaine cities of Spaine, &amp;c. built by this our Vly&s;&s;es: Of an altar in <HI>Caledonia,</HI> mentioned by Solinus, a prouince of Great Britaine, hauing an in&s;cri|ption vpon it written in Greeke letters, there con&s;ecrated and dedicated to &s;ome God who&s;e gratious fauour he had largely ta&s;ted of in this his iourney: Of <HI>A&s;ciburgium,</HI> a city built by him, as Tacitus writeth, vpon the brinke of the riuer Rheine, and of an altar there con&s;ecrated to his &s;eruice:) yet that they are altogether fained and meere fables, there be many things that do &s;trongly proue. And indeed Aulus Gellius, in the &s;ixth chapter of his foureteenth booke, &s;heweth, that long &s;ince this voiage vpon the Ocean &s;eas was doubted of and called in que&s;tion: videlicet, they made a que&s;tion whether Vly&s;&s;es wandred through the maine Ocean, as Ari&s;tarchus would haue it: or whether he neuer went out of the inner &s;ea, (&s;o Strabo and Pliny do call the Medi|terran or Midland &s;ea) as Cratetes would per&s;wade vs. And truely in Au&s;onius his Periocha there is not a word of this nauigation through the Ocean. Item, Vly&s;&s;es him&s;elfe relating vnto his wife the &s;umme of all his peregrination, doth not once name the Ocean. Neither doth Dares Phrygius, Hyginus in his fables, or I&s;acius vpon Lycophron, mention any &s;uch thing: and yet euery one of the&s;e men doe make a large di&s;cour&s;e of that his wandring voiage. Againe tho&s;e things which we find in Strabo of this matter, as he him&s;elfe plainly confe&s;&s;eth, were taken out of Po&s;&s;idonius, Artemidorus, and A&s;clepiades (euery one of which authours it is certaine liued many a day &s;ince Homer) and not out of Homer him&s;elfe. Item, the wi&s;e Seneca in the <HI>88.</HI> chapter of his &s;euenth booke, calleth it <HI>Angu&s;tum iter &amp; errorem longum,</HI> A &s;hort iourney, but long in regard of many turne-againes, before it was ended. But becau&s;e it was al&s;o before me, by the learned Iohn Brodey, a man of good iudgement and quicke conceit, accounted for a meere fable, I will heere, out of the third booke of his Mi&s;cellanea, &s;et downe his opinion in his owne words, which in Engli&s;h are thus: They, &s;aith he, who thinke that Vly&s;&s;es euer &s;ai|led vpon the Maine Ocean, do labour to prooue that their opinion, out of this ver&s;e of Homer, in the tenth booke of his Ody&s;&s;es, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, But when thou &s;halt by &s;hip haue pa&s;&s;'d the Ocean &s;eas: Of which opinion although I do find the learned Strabo to bee, yet I &s;ee no rea&s;on, why I may not freely propo&s;e to the cen&s;ure of the learned what I doe thinke of the &s;ame. When I doe con&s;ider the fa&s;hion and maner of building of

<PB REF="315"> Vly&s;&s;es &s;hippes de&s;cribed by Homer, to be open, without deckes and hatches, I doe perceiue them to haue beene much too weake and too low, to abide the bil|lowes and &s;tormes of the maine &s;ea: which for three moneths of the yeare galleies and tall &s;hippes, well and &s;trongly built of the be&s;t timber, and well &s;ea&s;o|ned can hardly be able to &s;u&s;taine. That any man &s;hould thinke that A&s;typyrgium, (or, A&s;ciburgium, which wee &s;pake of a little before) was built by Vly&s;&s;es, as &s;ome men haue gathered out of Cornelius Tacitus, it were extreame madne&s;&s;e. For if one would pa&s;&s;e the Spani&s;h, French and Engli&s;h &s;eas, and then at length to returne backe againe through the Germane Ocean, and in diuers places, on Gods name, vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t to build and erect altars, he had need haue a nauy of many tal &s;hips &s;trongly built &amp; wel appointed, he mu&s;t not think to do it with one little bark or rotten barge rowed to &amp; fro with oares and &s;trength of men. But authours of good credit do make mention of Vly&s;&s;ipo, and of other famous monuments of him to be &s;eene in Portugall. What then? Whether that any thing of Vly&s;&s;es his doing be there to be &s;eene or euer were I greatly doubt: and if there be, yet that it was made by this Vly&s;&s;es, who&s;e life &amp; famous acts Homer did de&s;cribe, I flatly deny. And yet it is not incredible to beleeue, that as we do &s;uppo&s;e that there were many Hercule&s;&s;es, &s;o that there were in like maner more Vly&s;&s;e&s;&s;es then one: which in mine opinion &s;eemeth very probable and likely to be true. Thus farre Brodey. To tho&s;e arguments of his I adde, fir&s;t, That Ody&s;&s;opolis is; by Cedrenus and the Hi&s;toria Mi&s;cella, de&s;cribed, to be neere Pontus in A&s;ia. And who is &s;o madde to beleeue that this city was &s;o named of this our Ody&s;&s;us or as the Latines call him Vly&s;&s;es? And &s;eeing that I do &s;ee that Homer him&s;elfe doth not make mention of any one place vnto the which he did put in or landed in all this his trauel vpon the Ocean &s;ea: I am ea&s;ily per&s;waded that this notable Poet doth, not only in this ver&s;e, but euen in diuers other places al&s;o by the Ocean, poetically mean the &s;ea. For example, neere the end of the <HI>10.</HI> book of his Ody&s;+&s;es &amp; ni the beginning of the <HI>11.</HI> a&s;&s;oone as euer he is returned from the <HI>Inferi,</HI> pre&s;ently Homer maketh him to enter the Ocean. But you will &s;ay he entred the Ocean, neere wherabout the <HI>Cimmerij</HI> did dwell, as appeareth plainly by that which he writeth in the beginning of the <HI>12.</HI> book of his Ody&s;&s;es: True. But where I pray you, did the&s;e <HI>Cimmerij</HI> dwell? No where &s;urely, but in Italy, within a little of the ile Circeia, &amp; being returned from thence, he burieth, according to his promi&s;e, the body of Elpenor. The body I mean, after &s;o many moneths, or, which is more probable, &s;o many yeres (for tho&s;e nauigations in old time were not the next way through the midde&s;t of the &s;ea, but much further about, as we haue &s;hewed in our The&s;aurus at the word <HI>OPHIR,</HI> along by the &s;hore within &s;ight of land) corrupt, or, which is more likely turned to du&s;t and a&s;hes, or quite con&s;umed to nothing. If any man &s;hall againe obiect (with Ouid in the fir&s;t booke of his Tri&s;tium, who &s;aith that <HI>illius pars maxima ficta laborum e&s;t:</HI> The mo&s;t part of Vly&s;&s;es toile, was forged in Poets braine) and &s;ay that this whole hi&s;tory, and not only this nauigation vpon the Maine Ocean, was but a feined tale. I an&s;wer, that all the &s;tory, except this part of his nauigation by the va&s;t Ocean only, is &s;omewhat probable, and nothing in it impo&s;&s;ible but might haue beene done. In this voiage by the Ocean &s;ea, I haue &s;tated the longer, le&s;t the Reader might &s;u&s;pect that either through negligence or ignorance it were left out in this our Mappe. Now let vs, if you plea&s;e, go on forward with our intended iourney. Vly&s;&s;es departing from the iland <HI>Aeaea,</HI> and taking his leaue of his ho&s;te&s;&s;e Circes, by whom, hauing kept with her by the &s;pace of an whole yeare, he begat his &s;onne Telegonus, he went his way &s;afe and &s;ound. For Mercury had giuen him the hearb <HI>Mo|ly</HI> (&s;o the Gods do call it) a &s;ure antidote and pre&s;eruatiue again&s;t all maner of inchantments and witchcraft. And &s;ailing along by the <HI>SIRENVM IN|SVLAE, (the Mirmaides ilands)</HI> he built the temple of Minerua <HI>(Fanum Mineruae)</HI> in <HI>CAMPANIA</HI> in Italy, as Strabo writeth. In this tract al&s;o, videlicet, in <HI>LVCANIA,</HI> as the &s;ame authour recordeth, he built the chapell of Draco <HI>(Sacellum Draconis)</HI> one of his companions in that his voiage. From thence he &s;ailed along by the &s;hore, and at length landed at <HI>TENESSA,</HI> a city of the Bruttij; (I&s;acius vpon Lycophronfal&s;ly writeth, that he landed in England, mi&s;taking <HI>Britannos,</HI> for <HI>Bruttios,</HI> or ignorantly confounding <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> with <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">:) as Pau&s;anias hath left recorded: Item, Suidas out of Pau&s;anias affirmeth the &s;ame, but withall he addeth that heere one of the &s;ailers did raui&s;h a virgin, and for that vild act was by the towne&s;men &s;toned to death. Neere to this towne the chapell of Politas, <HI>(Fanum Politae)</HI> one of Vly&s;&s;es con&s;orts, by Strabo is de&s;cribed to haue &s;tood. From hence it is likely out of Pliny, that he came to the iles <HI>ITHACEIAE,</HI> or, as otherwi&s;e they are called, <HI>Vly&s;&s;es &s;pecula,</HI> that is, Vly&s;&s;es beacon or lanterne. From hence &s;etting forward, and warily auoiding the dangerous <HI>Scylla,</HI> and <HI>Charybdes,</HI> (although not altogether without the lo&s;&s;e of &s;ome of his company) he came againe into <HI>TRINACRIA,</HI> or the Iland of the Sunne, <HI>(In&s;ula Solis)</HI> twi&s;e, as Horace &s;aith, or as Au&s;onius writeth, often lo&s;ing his way, and failing of his cour&s;e: where while he him&s;elfe was a&s;leep, &s;ome of his company killed certaine &s;heep of Sol, the gouernour of that place, out of his flocke, which, as Appianus Alexandrinus in the fifth booke of his Ciuill warres writeth, did feed neere Artemi&s;ium, a towne in Sicilia, which Barrius at this day thinketh to be called <HI>Agatha:</HI> for which their villanie and foule act committed by them, they were all ca&s;t away and &s;unke. Vly&s;&s;es him&s;elfe alone, getting vp vpon the ma&s;t of the &s;hip, e&s;caped and was carried into the ile <HI>OGYGIA,</HI> where hee dwelt &s;euen yeares, as Homer writeth, or &s;ix yeare, as Ouid te&s;tifieth: or tenne yeares, as Seruius would make vs beleeue, with the Nymph Calyp&s;o, by whom he gate his &s;onne Au&s;on. After all this, building a &s;hip with his owne hands, he &s;hippeth him&s;elfe and &s;etteth &s;aile all alone, for meere naturall loue of his country (preferring it before im|mortality, which the godde&s;&s;e had promi&s;ed if &s;o be he would &s;tay with her) committing him&s;elfe to the &s;ea, out alas he feeleth againe the &s;econd time the waight of Neptunes wrath, for that, as we haue &s;hewed before, he had put out the eies of his &s;onne Polyphemus. For the eighteenth (or, as Ouid writeth, the eightith) day after his fir&s;t &s;etting out, when as he came &s;o neere Ithaca, that he might ea&s;ily de&s;cry the &s;moke of the chimneies (mark the cro&s;&s;e lucke) tempe&s;tuous winds and raging &s;tormes do on euery &s;ide ari&s;e, &s;o that his &s;hip was ouerturned, and him&s;elfe throwen into the &s;ea, but, as God would haue it, ri&s;ing againe in&s;tantly he caught hold of the &s;hip. The Nymph Leucothea, (<HI>Nau&s;icaa,</HI> others call her) &s;eeing him thus toiled and wandring in the mid|de&s;t of the &s;ea, tooke compa&s;&s;ion vpon him, and pre&s;ently relieued him: &s;he adui&s;eth him to let go the &s;hip, to put off his apparell, and to commit him&s;elfe naked to the &s;ea only; and withall &s;he giueth him her fillet or haire-lace wherewith her head was bound vp: which he tying about his middle, &s;wom vntill he came vnto the country of the <HI>PHAEACES,</HI> (Cedrenus, fal&s;ly, hath Phoenices) where he arriued neere vnto the riuer Callirho&euml;. The fore&s;aid Ce|drenus writeth that he was carried from hence into <HI>Creta</HI> to Idomeneus; and by him conuieghed thence into <HI>Corcyra,</HI> vnto Alcinous. But let vs pro|ceed. With this fillet of Leucothea, he being tied vnto the &s;hip and hanging at it, (except heere Philo&s;tratus which is ordinary with him, doe tell a tale,) with his owne &s;trength, v&s;ing his hande in &s;teed of oares, he &s;womme through the midde&s;t of the &s;ea. Yet that the &s;hippe came thus farre and further, it &s;eemeth out of Pliny to be not altogether improbable: becau&s;e he writeth that about Phalacrum, a promontory or foreland of Phaeacia, or Corcyra, this &s;hip was turned into a rocke: which rocke Martianus &s;aith is in fa&s;hion and proportion like a &s;hip: although fal&s;ly hee in that place calleth this foreland Phalarium for Phalacrum. But if any man &s;hall &s;ay that he doth requite one tale with another, I will not greatly gain&s;ay him. From Phaeacia, by Alci|nous king of that country, who had mo&s;t honourably intertained him, he was at length conueighed to <HI>Ithaca</HI> his natiue country, who&s;e &s;moake he had ma|ny times and often de&s;ired before this to &s;ee. Where killing the woers, which were in number, if one may beleeue Athenaeus, an hundred and eight, or as Dictys Creten&s;is &s;aith but thirty onely, he embraceth and kindly &s;aluteth his louing wife Penelope. And this is the end of all the&s;e wandring peregrina|tions, in which, as Ouid &s;aith, <HI>Iactatus dubio per duo lu&s;tra mari:</HI> Tenne yeares he wandred vp and downe in &s;eas vnknowen. Signifying that the re&s;t of the yeares were &s;pent in trauels and troubles endured vpon the land. Of which the &s;ame authour al&s;o thus &s;peaketh, <HI>Ille breui &s;patio multis errauit in annis, Inter Dulichias Iliaca&s;&abque; domos.</HI> In trauell many yeares he &s;pent, his iourney was not farre, Betweene the iland Zante and Troy, that fa|mous towne of warre. I&s;acius vpon Lycophron te&s;tifieth that Vly&s;&s;es, by the coun&s;ell of Minerua, went to <HI>TRAMPYA,</HI> a city of the Eurytanes, a people of Epyrus or Aetolia, there to offer &s;acrifice vnto the Gods: and withall this our authour there addeth, that the&s;e people are the very &s;ame that Homer in the eleuenth booke of his Ody&s;&s;es &s;peaketh of in the&s;e words, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, that is, vntill hee came amongst tho&s;e men, that ne'r heard tell of Ocean &s;ea. Againe the &s;ame authour moreouer affirmeth that in this city Vly&s;&s;es was wor&s;hipped as a god, and that hee had an oracle there. Not farre from hence amongst the&s;e people al&s;o Stephanus placeth the city <HI>BVNIMA,</HI> fir&s;t founded by Vly&s;&s;es. That he was reuerenced as a god, I do find by a certaine &s;peech of Seneca that he v&s;eth of him vnto Serenus: and therefore it is no maruell that he &s;hould giue foorth an&s;wers and oracles. And that I may omit nothing of his labours, Dares Phrygius amongst diuers other of his dangerous attempts writeth that hee put in to harborough at <HI>MONVCHA.</HI> Ca&s;&s;iodorus in the twelfth booke of his <HI>Variar.</HI> writeth that the towne <HI>SCYLLACIVM</HI> was al&s;o built by him. That he erected a chap|pell vpon the toppe of mount <HI>BOREVS</HI> in Peloponne&s;us, to Neptune and Minerua So&s;pita, I do find in Pau&s;anias his: Arcadica. Apollodorus, as Strabo citeth, writeth that Vly&s;&s;es in this his voiage came to the ile <HI>CANNVS,</HI> but which this &s;hould be I know not. For of this name there are diuers, as thou &s;halt find in our The&s;aurus. And peraduenture it is not vnlikely to be true, that Vly&s;&s;es was to&s;&s;ed to and fro to diuers and &s;undry places; which Era|to&s;thenes, as Strabo alledgeth, &s;aith he will then find out, when it &s;halbe his chance to meet with the cobler which &s;ewed the bottell wherein he carried the windes which Aeolus gaue him. And thus much generally of the wandring voiage of this Captaine, which happened to him as he pa&s;&s;ed <HI>inter Dulichi|as Iliaca&s;que domos,</HI> Betweene the iland Zante and famous Troy, as Ouid reporteth. <HI>Sed perlege Ody&s;&s;eam omnia no&s;&s;e volens,</HI> But read o're learned Homers workes, He telleth this tale at large: as Au&s;onius in his Epitaphs coun&s;elleth. Yet of this our Vly&s;&s;es I cannot with &s;ilence pa&s;&s;e ouer that of Plutarch in his Morals; namely, for that he had killed tho&s;e Suters, it was by Neoptolemus decreed again&s;t him that hee mu&s;t leaue his country and be &s;eene no more in Ithaca, Dulichium and Zacynthus. So that in this his bani&s;hment he went againe into <HI>Italy.</HI> But where he left his life, it is vncer|taine.
<PB REF="315"> I&s;acius vpon Lycophron, an authour oft cited by vs, affirmeth out of Theopompus, that hee died in <HI>GORTYNIA,</HI> a city of Tyrrhenia in Italy. Yet Dictys Creten&s;is toward the latter end of his &s;ixth booke (whom al&s;o thou maie&s;t read if thou thinke&s;t good) &s;aith, that he died in <HI>ITHACA.</HI> All men for the mo&s;t part generally report, that he was &s;laine vnawares by his &s;onne Telegonus (holding &s;till in his hand a cuppe, as Athenaeus telleth the tale) with an iron dart, headed by his mother Circe, with a puffens quill <HI>(pa&s;tinaca marina,</HI> they call it) but for another purpo&s;e, as Oppianus in the &s;econd booke of his Halieutica writeth, namely to kill his enemy, not his father. Hyginus in the <HI>127.</HI> fable recordeth that a&s;&s;oone as he was dead hee was carried into the ile Aeaeato Circe, and was there by her interred. Some there are, as I&s;acius te&s;tifieth, that do report that Circe by her &s;orceries re&s;tored him a|gaine to his former life. More peraduenture might haue beene &s;aid of this our Vly&s;&s;es, if Cratinus Comicus, whom Athenaeus reporteth to haue written <HI>De Vly&s;&s;ibus,</HI> were now extant and to be gotten. Notwith&s;tanding, after this larger di&s;cour&s;e of the wandring voyage of this famous Captaine, I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to &s;peake a word or two of Vly&s;&s;es him&s;elfe, becau&s;e I verily per&s;wade my &s;elfe that it cannot but bee a matter that the Reader will very well like of. In a certaine &s;iluer coine or piece of money of Caius Mamilius Limetanus, who, as the report goeth, (thus te&s;tifieth Liuy) was lineally de&s;cended from Vly&s;&s;es, and the godde&s;&s;e Circe, was &s;tamped vpon one &s;ide the head of Mercury, and therefore it had, as is very probable, on the other &s;ide the &s;ig|net or counterfet of Vly&s;&s;es: which may be ea&s;ily prooued out of tho&s;e particulars and te&s;timonies that doe heereafter follow. Plutarch in the life of Cato the Elder, doth giue out that Vly&s;&s;es had a purpo&s;e to haue gone backe againe to the caue of Polyphemus, for no other cau&s;e but to demand his Cappe and Girdle, which there he had left behind him &amp; forgotten. Therfore, it is here hence apparant that he did v&s;ually weare a Cap and a Girdle. Yet we reade in Pliny that Nicomachus the painter did fir&s;t paint Vly&s;&s;es with a cappe vpon his head. And to be painted wearing a Cappe was a cogni&s;ance and badge of nobility, as Soranus in the life of Hippocrates doth plainly affirme: item, Dion Pru&s;aeus in his foureteenth oration &s;eemeth to intimate as much. Again, by an ancient cu&s;tome of the old Romanes they were woont by putting on a Cappe vpon a mans head, to make tho&s;e that were &s;laues, free. Whereupon they v&s;ed this phra&s;e of &s;peech <HI>Ad pileum vocare,</HI> To call a man to the Cappe, for <HI>Ad libertatem vocare,</HI> To make one a freeman. That this Cappe af Vly&s;|&s;es was in fa&s;hion round, it is manife&s;t out of the&s;e words of Saint Hierome, <HI>Rotundum pileolum, quale in Vly&s;&s;eo con&s;picimus,</HI> A round Cappe, &s;uch a like one as we do &s;ee vpon the counterfet of Vly&s;&s;es. I may al&s;o adde this one thing although &s;omewhat farre fetched, That they were called <HI>Pileati,</HI> as Iornandes te&s;tifieth, which amongst the Goths were accounted of greater birth and nobility, or of deeper reach and experience then the common &s;ort of men were of, becau&s;e they went with their heads couered with a kinde of bonnet or cappe. Moreouer he carried in his hand a &s;taffe, wherewith he &s;taid him|&s;elfe where the waies were &s;lippery, and defended him&s;elfe from &s;uch as in his trauell did a&s;&s;ault or mole&s;t him; as Homer te&s;tifieth of him in the fourteenth booke of his Ody&s;&s;es. He had al&s;o a dog, as the &s;ame authour affirmeth, which after twenty yeares ab&s;ence, at his returne home knew his ma&s;ter. Now the name of this dogge, as we read in the &s;ame authour, was Argus. Which al&s;o Plutarch, in his booke of the tranquillity of the mind, doth auouch to be true. And withall addeth this moreouer, that he wept for his dogge when he died. Pau&s;anias in his <HI>Phocicis,</HI> de&s;cribeth this our Vly&s;&s;es with a cor&s;let or coat-armor vpon his backe. Homer in the fifteenth booke of his Ody&s;&s;es &s;aith that he was bald or very thinne haired. Which is to be vnder&s;tood of his latter daies when he grew in yeares. For Suidas out of the afore&s;ayd authour &s;heweth, that his haire was blacke and curled. Be&s;ide that, he &s;aith that he was &s;omewhat hog-backed or &s;toup-&s;houldred. That he bare in his &s;hield or &s;cutcheon a Dolphin, and why, thou mai&s;t read in Plutarch in his book of the Com|pari&s;on of liuing creatures. But &s;ome man may aske me, why Mercury, wearing a broad brimmed hatte, with his verge or mace in his hand, was &s;tamped vpon the backe&s;ide of Vly&s;&s;es coine? If it be lawfull for me to ge&s;&s;e and interpo&s;e mine opinion, I an&s;wer, For the e&s;peciall and &s;ingular loue and fauour of this God aboue the re&s;t, &s;hewed at &s;undrie times toward this braue Captaine. For when in that his peregination all the Gods well neere were &s;et and oppo&s;ed again&s;t him, only Mercury was found to fauour him and to &s;ticke clo&s;e vnto him. For he only gaue him an antidote or pre&s;eruatiue again&s;t the &s;orceries and inchantments of the mi&s;chieuous witch Circe. And indeed we read that this God of all others was wont e&s;pecially to be honoured in any maner of magicall &s;eruices what&s;oeuer, as we may &s;ee in the fourth booke of Papirius his Thebaidos. Item, of this God he obtained leaue to depart, and that he might bee no longer detained by the nymph Calyp&s;o &amp;c. And peraduenture there may be al&s;o another cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned; namely for that Vly&s;&s;es, whom Homer and other authours do highly commend for a mo&s;t eloquent oratour, and one that could &s;peake mo&s;t wi&s;ely and to the purpo&s;e in any kind of matter, did take this god Mercury (whom the Gentiles did make the pre&s;ident of orators and eloquence) for his guardian and protector, thinking thereby to bind him &s;o much the more neerely vnto him. Pau&s;anias &s;aith that in <HI>Motya,</HI> a city of Sicilia there was the &s;tatue or counterfet of this our Vly&s;&s;es, but by Nero the Emperour it was from thence tran&s;ported to Rome in Italy. And thus much of this braue Captaine, <HI>Qui mores hominum multorum vidit &amp; vrbes,</HI> who, as the Poet writeth of him, &s;aw many mens maners and knew many cities. Of whom al&s;o thus &s;peaketh Ouid, <HI>Si min&ugrave;s erra&s;&s;et, notus min&ugrave;s e&s;&s;et Vly&s;&s;es?</HI> If great Vly&s;&s;es had not &s;trai'd, he had beene more ob&s;cure. But of him I will &s;peake no more: le&s;t peraduenture with the Grammarians, I bee hit in the teeth with that of Diogenes: who &s;aid that while they did &s;earch diligently to know all the cro&s;&s;es and euils that befell Vly&s;&s;es, did forget their owne. And moreouer that worthy admonition of wi&s;e Seneca, where he &s;aith, <HI>Quid proderit inquirere vbi Vly&s;&s;es errauerit, qu&agrave;m ne nos &s;emper erremus?</HI> What &s;hall it auaile vs to &s;eeke where and which way Vly&s;&s;es wandred, more then to re&s;traine vs that we do not in like maner alwaies wander as he did? And now it is high time to take penne from paper. As for tho&s;e coines which we haue &s;poken of before, I wi&s;h thee to repaire to Goltzius and others which haue at large and peculiarly handled that argument.</P>

<HEAD>A de&s;cription of the RED SEA, now vulgarly called, <HI>The</HI> INDIAN SEA.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_MARE ERYTHRAEVM,</HI> or, as the Latines call it, <HI>MARE RVBRVM, The Red Sea,</HI> which heere we offer to thy view in this Mappe, for as much as we can gather out of ancient writers, &s;tretcheth it &s;elfe from the We&s;t, as Liuy writeth along by the coa&s;t of A|frica or Aethiopia, euen vnto India in Ea&s;t, yea and beyond that, I know not how farre, as Arrianus te&s;tifieth: whereupon Ptolemey, Pliny and Melado call it <HI>MARE INDICVM, The Indian Sea.</HI> But Herodotus calleth it <HI>MARE PERSICVM, The Per&s;ian Sea.</HI> Which Pliny doth &s;eeme to iu&s;tifie to be true, where he &s;aith, That the Per&s;ians do dwell along by the coa&s;t of the Red Sea, between the coa&s;t of Africa, and the iland Taprobana. Strabo that worthy Geographer, he calleth it <HI>MARE MAGNVM, The Great &s;ea,</HI> who moreouer doth affirme it to be a part of the Atlanticke &s;ea, and that truly. A part of this &s;ea, to wit, where it toucheth the coa&s;t of that Aethiopia which lieth beneath Aegypt, Pliny, of the countrie Azania (which at this day &s;ome do thinke to bee called <HI>Xoa</HI>) nameth it <HI>MARE AZANIVM.</HI> Where it ioineth with the Bay of Arabia, it is of Ptolemey named <HI>HIPPADIS PELAGVS,</HI> now called of &s;ome <HI>Archiplago di Maldiuar.</HI> Item, of the &s;ame Ptolemey it is otherwi&s;e called <HI>BARBARICVS SINVS, The Barbarian bay:</HI> I meane in that place where it beateth vpon Aethiopia, and the iland Menuthe&s;ia, now of the &s;eamen generally called, <HI>The iland of Saint Laurence,</HI> but of that country people <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and of Theuet <HI>Alba|gra.</HI> There are two Baies or Gulfes, as the Italians and Spaniards terme them, of this &s;ea much talked of in all ancient hi&s;tories: to wit, <HI>SINVS PER|SICVS, The Per&s;ian Bay,</HI> and <HI>SINVS ARABICVS, The Arabian Bay,</HI> which &s;ome, not well read in old writers, do for the mo&s;t part call <HI>Ma|re Rubrum,</HI> The Red Sea. Very improperly, being indeed but a part of that &s;ea, properly called the Red &s;ea, which we haue hitherto &s;poken of. But why it was of the Greekes named <HI>Erythraeum,</HI> and of the Latines <HI>Rubrum,</HI> Red, it is a great que&s;tion amongst the learned not yet decided. Some there are which do deeme it to haue beene called, The Red Sea, of the colour of the water: but this, of all late writers, trauellers, &s;eamen, and other eie-witne&s;&s;es of good credit, which haue in this our age, &amp; euery day do &s;aile through this Sea, &amp; haue diligently viewed the &s;ame, is improued and found to be altogether fal&s;e. Moreouer Qu. Curtius amongst the ancients doth plainly te&s;tifie that it differeth no whit in colour from other &s;eas. Some there are as Pliny writeth, which do thinke that, by rea&s;on of the reuerberation of the Sunne beames, it &s;eemeth to ca&s;t vp &s;uch a like colour to the &s;ight of the beholders. Others doe thinke that this is cau&s;ed by rea&s;on of the colour of the &s;and or earth in the bottom of the &s;ame: others do affirm it to be the very nature of the water. Some do write that it was &s;o named of king Erythrus, Per&s;eus &s;onne, who&s;e tombe, as Quintus Curtius writeth, did in his time remaine in a certaine iland of this &s;ea not farre di&s;tant from the maine land: (Strabo calleth this iland, <HI>Tyrina:</HI> Pliny and Pomponius Mela, <HI>Ogyris:</HI> Arrianus, <HI>Oaracta:</HI>) or el&s;e of a certaine Per&s;ian named Erythras, as the forenamed Strabo giueth out. Who, as Pliny with him te&s;tifieth, in a &s;mall barke or barge fir&s;t &s;ailed through this &s;ea and di&s;couered the &s;ame. Which &s;tory al&s;o is at large handled by Agatarchides. Yet our authour calleth him Hippalus, who fir&s;t found out the cour&s;e to &s;aile through the midde&s;t of this &s;ea. Pliny by that name calleth the wind by which they make their iourneis through this &s;ea. (So called as is ve|ry probable of the inuentour.) Which wind the &s;ame authour in the thirteenth chapter of his <HI>6.</HI> booke, maketh the &s;ame that Fauonius is vnto the Latines. Mela &amp; Agatarchides do call it a tempe&s;tuous, &s;tormy, rough and deepe &s;ea. Pliny, Philo&s;tratus, Elianus, &amp; Athenaeus do giue it the title of <HI>Margaritife|rum,</HI>
<PB REF="316"> the pearle-bearing &s;ea. And the &s;ame Pliny maketh it <HI>Arboriferum,</HI> a tree-bearing &s;ea. For he writeth in the fiue and twentieth chapter of his thirteenth booke, that it is full of groues and tall woods: the toppes of who&s;e high trees he affirmeth are &s;eene much aboue the waters, and therfore at high tide they v&s;e to fa&s;ten their &s;hippes vnto the toppes, and at the ebbe vnto the roots of the &s;ame. Item, the &s;ame authour, in the two and twentieth chapter of the &s;ixth booke of his Naturall hi&s;torie, writeth that about Colaicum, (which al&s;o is called Colchi) or as Solinus affirmeth about Tapobrana, an iland not farre hence, the &s;ea is of a very greeni&s;h colour, and &s;o full of trees that their toppe boughes are barked and bru&s;hed with the rudders or &s;terne of tho&s;e &s;hips that &s;aile this way. Moreouer that trees do grow in this &s;ea Mega&s;thenes, out of Antigonus <HI>de Mirabilibus,</HI> doth affirme, which Plutarch in his Naturall que&s;tions, and againe in his booke <HI>de facie Lunae,</HI> doth auouch to be true: where he doth particularly nominate &s;ome of them, to wit, Oliue-trees, Bay-trees, and Plocamus, which otherwi&s;e they call I&s;idis Capillus. This al&s;o Strabo in the &s;ixth booke of his Geography iu&s;tifieth to be true: &s;o doth the forenamed Pliny, who teacheth vs that it is a plant much like to corall without leaues. Agatarchides &s;aith that it re&s;embleth much the blacke ru&s;h. Athenaeus out of Philonides the Phy&s;ician writeth, that the vine was fir&s;t brought from the Redde-&s;ea and planted in Greece. In the eigth chapter of the fourth booke of Theophra&s;tus his hi&s;tory of plants, you may reade of diuer&s;e other kinds of trees and herbs which do naturally grow in this &s;ea. Pom|ponius &s;heweth, that this &s;ea hath more and greater mon&s;ters that do liue and breed in it then any other &s;ea in the world be&s;ide. Quintus Curtius affir|meth that it is full of whales, <HI>(balaenae)</HI> of &s;uch an huge bigne&s;&s;e that they are in bulke equall to the greate&s;t &s;hippes or ve&s;&s;els that are. Solinus &s;aith that one of them will couer two akers of ground. The &s;ame authour doth there de&s;cribe vnto vs certaine blew wormes, which haue their forelegges not le&s;&s;e then &s;ix foot long. The&s;e are of that wonderfull &s;trength that oft times they do with their clawes lay hold vpon Elephants comming thitherto drinke, and by maine force pull them into the &s;ea. Item, he telleth of certaine whirle-pooles, <HI>Phy&s;eteras,</HI> he calleth them, of that huge bigne&s;&s;e, that they are to &s;ee to like vnto great and ma&s;&s;ie columnes, the&s;e doe many times rai&s;e them&s;elues vp as high as the cro&s;&s;e-ma&s;t, from whence they &s;pout out &s;uch abundance of water out of their gullets, that oft times by the violence of the &s;torme the ve&s;&s;els of tho&s;e which &s;aile and pa&s;&s;e by that way are &s;unke and ca&s;t away. Strabo hath left in writing, that Amazenas, the admirall of the Indian fleet, did there &s;ee a whale of fifty foot in length. Arrianus in his Indica de&s;cribeth cer|taine <HI>balaenas,</HI> whales or whirlepooles, of an huge and wonderfull bigne&s;&s;e, with three &s;orts of great and terrible kind of Serpents, which as Solinus wri|teth will couer more then two akers of lands. It is recorded by Pliny that the Hydri, certaine &s;ea-monsters of twenty cubites in length, did much affright the nauy of Alexander the Great. Item, he telleth of tortei&s;es of &s;uch a maruellous bigne&s;&s;e, that the &s;hell of one of them will make a couer for a prettie hou&s;e: and againe, That they v&s;ually do &s;aile in the&s;e &s;hels vpon this &s;ea, like as they v&s;e in other countries in &s;hippes and boates. Yea, as Agatarchides affirmeth, the&s;e fi&s;hes do &s;erue tho&s;e which dwell vpon this &s;ea coa&s;t, in&s;tead of hou&s;es, boats, di&s;hes and meat. About the iland Taprobana, now called as generally all learned do thinke, Samotra, there are certaine fi&s;hes, which do liue partly vpon &s;ea and partly vpon land, whereof &s;ome are like oxen, others like hor&s;es, and other &s;ome are like other foure footed bea&s;ts, as Strabo in his fifteenth and &s;ixteenth bookes hath left recorded. And thus much of the name, &s;ituation and nature of this Redde-&s;ea, which Liuy in his <HI>45.</HI> booke tearmeth, <HI>Finem terrarum,</HI> The outmo&s;t bound of the world. He that de&s;i|reth to know more of this &s;ea, let him haue recour&s;e to Agatarchides and Arrianus in his Indica. Item, let him con&s;ult with Bapti&s;ta Ramu&s;io, who tran|&s;lated this <HI>Periplus,</HI> or di&s;couery, into the Italian tongue, and hath enlarged the &s;ame with a di&s;cour&s;e, as hee calleth it, of his owne, of the &s;ame argu|ment. And I would wi&s;h him not to omit Stuckius, who al&s;o tran&s;lated the &s;ame into the Italian tongue, and hath illu&s;trated it with his mo&s;t learned and laborious Commentaries. La&s;tly, Athenaeus in the fourteenth booke of his Deipno&s;ophi&s;ton, maketh me beleeue that Pythagoras that great and famous Philo&s;opher, did write a booke of the Redde &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>HANNO'S PERIPLVS, OR, Di&s;couery of the Atlanticke Seas and Coa&s;ts of Africa.</HEAD>
<P>_THis Periplus of Hanno king of Carthage, was fir&s;t tran&s;lated out of Greeke into Latine by Conradus Ge&s;nerus, a man that hath very well de&s;erued of all &s;orts of &s;cholars &amp; &s;uccedent ages, &amp; hath illu&s;trated the &s;ame with his mo&s;t learned and painfull Commentaries. But before him Bapti&s;ta Ramu&s;io turned it into the Tu&s;cane tongue, and hath to it adioined a di&s;cour&s;e, as he termeth it. Of the ancient writers Pomponius Mela in the &s;econd chapter of his third booke, &amp; Pliny in the fir&s;t chapter of the fift book of his hi&s;tory of Nature, who there calleth him a captaine of Carthage, not king of Cathage, haue made mention of this Periplus or Di&s;couery. But he calleth this di&s;cour&s;e by the name of Commentaries, not of a Periplus. The &s;ame Pliny in the one and thirtieth chapter of his &s;ixth booke calleth him an Emperour. Yet Solinus in the la&s;t chapter of his worke, out of Xenophon Lamp&s;acenus, maketh as if hee had beene a king of the Poeni. Arrianus al&s;o toward the latter end of his Indian &s;tories mentioneth this Periplus. Moreouer Pliny in the &s;ixteenth chapter of the eighteenth booke of his Naturall hi&s;torie, and Aelianus in the fiftieth chapter of his fifth booke <HI>De Animalibus,</HI> do make mention of one Hanno, who was the fir&s;t man that euer was heard of in the world that dur&s;t handle, and take vpon him to tame a Lion. But whether he be the &s;ame with this our Hanno, I am not able to determine. For there haue beene many of that name: of which, if any man be de&s;irous to know more, let him repaire to the Commentaries of the forenamed Ge&s;ner, which he wrot vpon this Periplus. The&s;e words in Pliny and Martianus in very deed are meant of another Hanno, diuers from this of whom wee haue hitherto &s;poken. Hanno, &s;ay they, at &s;uch time as the Punicke Empire &s;tood in flouri&s;hing e&s;tate, &s;ailed round about by the coa&s;t of Barbary, and &s;o from thence South-ward all along by the &s;hore, vntill at length after a long and tedious iourney he came to the coa&s;ts of Arabia. More|ouer that &s;tudent that is de&s;irous to know more of this Periplus or Di&s;couery, may adde to the&s;e collections of ours, &s;uch things as Iohn Mariana hath writ|ten of it, in the latter end of his fir&s;t booke of his hi&s;tory of Spaine.</P>

<HEAD>ARGONAVTICA, That is, IASONS voyage for the GOLDEN FLEECE.</HEAD>
<P>_THere is none almo&s;t of the ancients which hath not as it were by the way touched the &s;tory of the ARGONAVTES, that is, of IASON, or of the GOLDEN FLEECE: but among&s;t tho&s;e which of &s;et purpo&s;e haue handled that matter as <HI>Cleon, Herodotus, Pi&s;ander, Diony&s;ius, Mile&s;ius, Varro At|tacinus,</HI> and <HI>Epimenides</HI> (who, as <HI>Laertius</HI> recordeth, &s;et out the &s;ame at large in 6500. ver&s;es) there are only three remaining at this day, that haue come to our handes; namely, <HI>Valerius Flaccus, Orpheus</HI> and <HI>Apollonius Rhodius.</HI> In all which three, the iourney foorth-ward of tho&s;e Argo|nautes (that is, of <HI>Ia&s;on</HI> and his con&s;orts which &s;ailed with him in the &s;hip named the <HI>Argo</HI>) is rea&s;onably alike de&s;cribed, but in the returne of them homeward they differ very much one from another in their relations: For <HI>Flaccus</HI> bringeth them backe from <HI>Colchis,</HI> by the North &s;hore of the <HI>Euxine &s;ea, (Mar maiore)</HI> and &s;o vnto the mouth of the riuer <HI>I&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Danubius (Done</HI> or <HI>Donaw)</HI> and there he leaueth them; being preuented by death, as he peraduenture &s;uppo&s;ed. <HI>Apollonius</HI> bringeth him vp again&s;t the &s;treame of the &s;aid riuer, and &s;o out of it by the riuer <HI>Sabus (Saw)</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Trogus</HI> do thinke, into the Hadriaticke and Ionian &s;eas: not farre off from <HI>Terge&s;te (Trie&s;te,</HI> in <HI>Friuli)</HI> but as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, they were forced out of the way by the riuer <HI>E|ridanus (Po)</HI> into <HI>Rhodanus (Rho&s;ne)</HI> vnto the <HI>Stoechades (I&s;les de hyerres)</HI> certaine ilands in the Ligu&s;ticke &s;ea <HI>(Mar di Leone)</HI> ouer-again&s;t <HI>Narbone</HI> in <HI>France:</HI> out of which &s;ailing through the Midland and Aegean &s;eas, they came &s;afe home to the place from whence they fir&s;t &s;et out. But <HI>Orpheus</HI> he telleth the &s;tory with a farre greater circum&s;tance, and maketh them to fetch a larger compa&s;&s;e about, namely, by the riuer <HI>Tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> (Don)</HI> and that huge wood (as he calleth it) or endle&s;&s;e, as <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer</HI> termeth it: and that not without iu&s;t cau&s;e: for I deeme it to be the greate&s;t wood of the whole world that yet to vs is de&s;cried. (The&s;e latter ages call'd by one proper name <HI>Orcynium,</HI> or <HI>Hercynia.</HI>) Then by the North &s;ea, called of them <HI>Croni|um</HI> (named by <HI>Seneca</HI> in his tragedie, intituled <HI>Medea, Vr&s;ae vetitum mare</HI>) and by the Atlanticke &s;ea vnto <HI>Hercules pillars</HI> (the &s;treights of <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) compa&s;&s;ing round all <HI>Europe,</HI> came at la&s;t home &s;afe againe to their owne hou&s;es. This voyage there|fore we haue in this our Mappe, framed out of tho&s;e three forenamed authours: which will ea&s;ily and plainly appeare to him that &s;hall examine the &s;ame with the &s;tories &s;et downe by them. Be&s;ide tho&s;e places named by them, we haue added certaine other, out of other authours, neuer touched by them, yet pertaining to this their purpo&s;e: as namely, <HI>Salmyde&s;&s;us</HI> in <HI>Thracia,</HI> where <HI>Apollodorus</HI> &s;aith they landed or put into harborough. <HI>Item, AEmonia,</HI> a towne built by the Argonautes in that place where they laying the <HI>Argo,</HI> their &s;hip, vpon ingines [their &s;houlders, as <HI>Pindarus</HI> and <HI>Trogus</HI> haue giuen out, and &s;o <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, the be&s;t authours affirme] caried it from the &s;hore 400. furlongs: or, which is all one, 50. miles, euen vnto the coa&s;tes of the <HI>The&s;&s;alians (Italians, Zozomen</HI> readeth: differing in word and maner of writing, not in truth of &s;tory: for they were The&s;&s;alians by birth and parentage, now &s;eated in the land of <HI>Italy</HI>) as we find recorded in <HI>Zo&s;imus</HI> and others. There is the city <HI>Pola,</HI> a worke begun and perfected by the <HI>Colchi,</HI> who, being &s;ent to pur&s;ue <HI>Medea,</HI> vp to the riuer <HI>Done, (I&s;ter)</HI> vp as high as the ilands then called <HI>Ab&s;yrtides,</HI> where, being fru&s;trate of their purpo&s;e, they &s;taid: and of the riuer <HI>I&s;ter,</HI> vp which they &s;ailed: they called the country through which it runneth <HI>I&s;tria. Phla,</HI> or if you plea&s;e <HI>Phila,</HI> an iland in the lake <HI>Triton,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> where <HI>Herodotus</HI> writeth that <HI>Ia&s;on</HI> arriued, and the North wind blowing &s;tiffe again&s;t him was driuen to <HI>Malea,</HI> a promontory or foreland of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and there to haue giuen his <HI>tripos,</HI> (or <HI>treuet</HI>) to <HI>Triton.

This &s;elfe &s;ame Temple <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> nameth the Temple of the Argonautes. In <HI>Pau|&s;anias</HI> and <HI>Varro,</HI> we read that the &s;ame <HI>Ia&s;on</HI> dedicated a Temple to <HI>Iuno,</HI> in the ile <HI>Samos, (Samo.) Item,</HI> to <HI>Iuno Argiua in agro Picentino, (Principato,</HI> or <HI>Co&s;ta de Ainalfe)</HI> as <HI>Pliny</HI> hath left recorded. And that hee erected altars neere the riuer <HI>I&s;ter, (Done</HI> or <HI>Donaw)</HI> where it diuideth it &s;elfe into two &s;treames, emptying his waters partly into <HI>Pontus (Mar maiore)</HI> and partly into <HI>Adria,</HI> (the Gulfe of <HI>Venice) Ari&s;totle</HI> teacheth in his <HI>Admiranda.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he meant this of the <HI>Cauca&s;ian rockes, (Caucasij &s;copuli.)</HI> Fabulous antiquity verily beleeued that the riuer <HI>I&s;ter</HI> had i&s;&s;ue out into the <HI>Hadriaticke &s;ea.</HI> Perad|uenture mooued by that which <HI>Pliny</HI> in the fifteenth chapter of his fourth booke, hath mo&s;t fabulou&s;ly written, that certaine fi&s;h called Tunies, breed in the Euxine &s;ea, <HI>(Pontus Euxinus Mar maiore)</HI> do &s;wimme vp the riuer <HI>I&s;ter,</HI> and from thence do pa&s;&s;e, by &s;ecret pa&s;&s;ages vnder the ground into the Hadriaticke &s;ea. And thus farre of this gadding and rouing voiage by &s;ea, which from their fir&s;t &s;etting forward vntill their returne, as <HI>Apollodorus</HI> reporteth out of ancient recordes, was performed in the &s;pace of foure moneths. Which in my iudgement &s;eemeth not very probable: I beleeue he dreamed when he wrote this &s;torie. For &s;o many moneths would &s;carce be &s;ufficient for one to &s;aile vp the riuer <HI>I&s;ter,</HI> again&s;t the &s;treame, from his mouth where it falleth into <HI>Mar maiore,</HI> vnto <HI>Terge&s;te, (Trie&s;te)</HI> vpon the Gulfe of <HI>Venice,</HI> much le&s;&s;e could they be able in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace to go &s;o long and tedious a iourney as this was de&s;cribed to be. More true and likely by farre are tho&s;e wordes of <HI>Hyp&s;ipula</HI> to <HI>Ia&s;on,</HI> (for &s;he intertained him into her hou&s;e at the ile <HI>Lemnos</HI> (now it is named <HI>Stalamine.)

<HEAD>TEMPE THESSALICA, OR The PARADISE of THESSALY.</HEAD>
<P>_BEing admoni&s;hed in my &s;leepe by the Godde&s;&s;e <HI>Fe&s;&s;onia,</HI> (which they were wont to adore and pray vnto, that by rea&s;on of any great labour or farre trauell were faint and weary <HI>(fe&s;si)</HI> that after this long and tedious peregrination ouer the whole world, I &s;hould bethinke my &s;elfe of &s;ome place of re&s;t, where the painfull &s;tudents, faint and wearied in this long and weari&s;ome iourney, might recreate them&s;elues; I pre&s;ently, as &s;oone as I awaked, went about it: and while I &s;urueigh all the quarters of the huge globe of the Earth, behold the noble TEMPE, famous for their &s;acred groues, by the leading of <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> that renowmed Geographer, do offer them&s;elues to my view and con&s;ideration: tho&s;e therefore &s;haddowed out in their true and liuely colours with the be&s;t art of painters pencill: and rudely de&s;cribed by our more vnskilfull penne we haue annexed to the end of the&s;e our labours. They are &s;i|tuate in AEMMONIA, as <HI>Ouid</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> do te&s;tifie: or THESSALIA, which is all one in the iudgement of <HI>Solinus</HI> and <HI>Liuy.</HI> But in regard that the riuer <HI>Peneus (Pezin,</HI> or <HI>Salampria)</HI> doth part <HI>The&s;&s;aly</HI> from <HI>Macedony,</HI> they &s;eeme ra|ther to be &s;ituate in the confines of both the&s;e countries, than to be conteined wholly within the bound of one. <HI>Strabo Pliny, Herodotus, Liuy</HI> and <HI>Theon,</HI> the petifogger, by the iudgement of <HI>Theopompus,</HI> do place the&s;e <HI>Tempe,</HI> or this large and plea&s;ant plaine (through the midde&s;t of which the goodly cleare riuer <HI>Peneus</HI> doth runne) between the two &s;tately mountaines <HI>O&s;&s;a, (Olira,</HI> or <HI>Co&s;&s;ouo)</HI> and <HI>Olympus,</HI> now called <HI>Lacha. Solinus</HI> al&s;o is of the &s;ame opinion, as appeareth by the&s;e his wordes: <HI>Peneus</HI> the riuer, which running between the mountaines <HI>O&s;&s;a</HI> and <HI>Olympus,</HI> with the goodly hils ri&s;ing and falling gently by degrees, and woody vales, doth make the plea&s;ant <HI>Tempe</HI> in <HI>The&s;&s;alia; Tempe, quae &s;yluae cin|gunt &s;uper impendentes,</HI> The <HI>Tempe</HI> which the ouer-hanging groues do round inclo&s;e, as <HI>Catullus</HI> the poet in his <HI>Argo|nautickes,</HI> hath left recorded. It is, as <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, about three lands breadths ouer, <HI>(&s;e&s;qui iugerum, AElianus</HI> calleth it <HI>Plethrum.)</HI> The length (which they do define to be from the mouth of the riuer <HI>Gannum,</HI> euen vnto the bay, now vul|garly called <HI>Golfo di Salonichi,</HI> then <HI>Sinus Thermaeus</HI>) is as <HI>Liuy</HI> te&s;tifieth fiue miles, or as <HI>AElianus</HI> &s;aith, which is all one, forty furlongs. The&s;e mountaines, <HI>Liuy</HI> writeth are &s;o high, &s;teepe, and craggy on all &s;ides, that a man may &s;carce looke downe from off the toppe of them, without a dazling of the eies, and giddine&s;&s;e of the braine. The noi&s;e al&s;o and depth of the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> which runneth through the midde&s;t of the valley, is very terrible. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith that the &s;tately toppes of the&s;e mountaines, on euery &s;ide do ri&s;e by little and little vp higher into the aire, than a man may well di&s;cern. Within the&s;e hils the goodly riuer <HI>Peneus</HI> doth runne; which for his cry&s;tall waters, rowling ouer the &s;mooth pebbles; the goodly meddowes and gra&s;&s;e alwaies fre&s;h and green vpon the bankes: the ouerhanging groues and trees continu|ally re&s;ounding with the melodious harmony of &s;weet &s;inging birds, is &s;o plea&s;ant and delight&s;ome as any in the world be&s;ide. But becau&s;e all the&s;e authours haue &s;poken of it, as it were by the way, and not of &s;et purpo&s;e: I thinke it not a|mi&s;&s;e to &s;et downe in this place, the de&s;cription of it, done by <HI>AElianus</HI> as you may read in the fir&s;t chapter of his third booke <HI>De varia hi&s;toria,</HI> where it is mo&s;t curiou&s;ly and ab&s;olutely &s;et out in his true and liuelie colours. The&s;e therefore are his wordes.</P>
<P>There is a place between <HI>Olympus</HI> and <HI>O&s;&s;a,</HI> the two loftie&s;t mountaines of all <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> di&s;ioined one from another, by the diuine prouidence of eternall God, by a faire plaine or leuell running between them: the length of this plaine or valley is fortie furlongs: It is from one &s;ide to the other in &s;ome places, two or three lands breadths ouer, in &s;ome places it is &s;omewhat broader. Through the midde&s;t of this valley runneth the riuer <HI>Peneus:</HI> into which al&s;o other riuers fal|ling and mingling their waters with his, do much encrea&s;e the &s;treame of <HI>Peneus.</HI> This place is mo&s;t plea&s;ant and de|light&s;ome, by rea&s;on of his great varietie of all &s;orts of alluring and inticeing plea&s;ures, neuer made by any art or indu&s;try of man, but by nature it &s;elfe, &s;hewing all her skill in the beautifying of this valleie, at &s;uch time as it was fir&s;t made. There is in this place great &s;tore of iuie alwaie green and flouri&s;hing, alwaie budding and putting forth his plea&s;ant &s;lowres, euer clinging and winding in maner like the goodlie vine, about the talle&s;t trees, and clambring vp by little and little vn|till it come euen to the verie toppe. In the &s;ame places grow the aie-green yeugh-tree, which lifting vp it &s;elfe aloft vpon the rockes, &s;haddoweth the caues, holes and cliffes, which beneath lie lurking in the vale. All other things what&s;oeuer do flouri&s;h, blo&s;&s;ome, and beare flowers are there to be &s;eene: this is a mo&s;t gallant and glorious &s;hew for the eies to be|hold. In the plaine, when the &s;unne is at his height in &s;ummer, you &s;hall haue manie goodlie &s;haddowie groues and di|uers places of &s;helter, into which trauellers, de&s;irous for to refre&s;h their wearied limmes from the violence of the heat and their noi&s;ome &s;weat, do betake them&s;elues, as into the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and delight&s;ome&s;t innes and harboroughs that are in the world. Moreouer of ouerflowing wels and plea&s;ant &s;prings of mo&s;t coole and fre&s;h waters running heere and there in &s;undrie places of this valleie, there are verie manie and diuers: which if we &s;hall beleeue the report of our fathers, haue been verie whole&s;ome and &s;oueraigne to &s;undrie &s;orts of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons that haue wa&s;hed them&s;elues in the &s;ame. Againe, diuers birds heere and there di&s;per&s;ed in the&s;e groues and woods, do make the gue&s;ts great mirth at their ban|quets, with their &s;weet &s;inging and plea&s;ant tunes: e&s;pecially tho&s;e which haue the lowde&s;t and &s;weete&s;t voices, do &s;o plea&s;e and hold the eares of the heares, that tho&s;e which pa&s;&s;e by this waie are &s;o raui&s;hed and delighted with this their mu&s;icke, that they in&s;tantly forget all their trauels and bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. On ech banke of the riuer &s;uch are the delights, plea|&s;ures and recreations for the wearied trauellers, as before we haue mentioned. Yet the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> going on lea&s;urely, and &s;moothly like an oile, runneth quietly through the midde&s;t of the <HI>Tempe.</HI> About this riuer, by rea&s;on of the trees which grow vpon the bankes, and their farre-&s;preading boughs, is a mo&s;t goodly &s;hade: &s;o that &s;uch as row in boates, vp and downe vpon this &s;treame, for almo&s;t a whole day together, may &s;aile in the plea&s;ant &s;hade free from the violence and &s;chorching heat of the &s;unne. The people which dwell vpon this riuer, do oft times meet in companies, &s;ometimes in one place and &s;ometimes in another. Hauing done diuine &s;eruice and ceremonies in due forme and maner, they ban|quet and make merrie. Therefore tho&s;e which do the&s;e &s;eruices and performe the&s;e ceremonies being very many, it is no maruell though &s;uch as come hither to walke for recreation, tho&s;e which trauell by this way or &s;aile vp or downe this riuer vpon what occa&s;ion &s;oeuer, do continually &s;mell a mo&s;t &s;weet and fragrant &s;auour. In this maner this place was con&s;ecrated with great honour &amp; religious &s;eruices. The&s;e things and many other hath <HI>Aelianus</HI> written of the&s;e <HI>Tempe.</HI></P>

<P>Of the&s;e al&s;o <HI>Procopius</HI> (although he nameth them not by name) hath written in his fourth booke <HI>De Aedif. Iu&s;tiniani Imperatoris.</HI> There is a braue de&s;cription of the&s;e places in <HI>Catullus</HI> his Argonauticks. But I thinke it good here to &s;et downe out of diuers writers certaine &s;euerall things of the&s;e <HI>Tempe,</HI> as they are here and there di&s;per&s;ed in their works. <HI>Maximus Tyrius,</HI> in his xxxix. oration, hath left recorded, that diuine honour in olde time was done to the riuer <HI>Pe|neus,</HI> for his maruellous goodly beautie and farre-&s;urpa&s;&s;ing cleere waters. <HI>Pliny</HI> writeth, that this riuer doeth admit into his channell the &s;treame of the brooke <HI>Eurotas,</HI> but &s;o as it &s;wimmeth aloft like oile; and hauing caried it &s;o for a certaine &s;pace, ca&s;teth it off againe, as refu&s;ing to quaint and intermeddle his &s;iluer &s;treame with his filthy &s;tincking troubled waters. The &s;ame authour &s;ayth, that here groweth great plentie of Laurell, Polypody, Dolichus (a kinde of beane) Wilde-time, and Water-lilly: but this hath a blacke flower, if we may beleeue <HI>Apuleius. Pau&s;anias</HI> in his <HI>Pho|cica,</HI> writeth that the temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> at <HI>Delphos</HI> was built of Laurell boughes which grew in this place. <HI>Mela</HI> and the Poets do &s;peake of <HI>O&s;&s;a,</HI> the mountaine memorable for the fabulous &s;torie of the Giants: who al&s;o doe report, that the <HI>Lapithae</HI> a people of <HI>The&s;&s;aly,</HI> did &s;ometime dwell here. In the &s;ame mountaine I reade in <HI>Polyaenus</HI> his fourth booke, that <HI>Alexander</HI> King of <HI>Indica,</HI> (for &s;o I do rather yeeld to haue it read, than <HI>India,</HI> as hitherto the interpretours haue &s;et foorth, &s;eeing that <HI>Indica</HI> is a countrey hard by <HI>Pontus,</HI> as <HI>Stephanus</HI> directly auerreth) by hewing downe the craggie cliffes of this mountaine, did make certaine &s;mall &s;taires, which &s;equent ages called <HI>Alexanders ladder.</HI> Nere the&s;e <HI>Tem|pe</HI> there is a water de&s;cribed by <HI>Seneca</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> which is &s;o ilfauoured and filthy, that it will make any man affrayd to looke into it; and which, they &s;ay, will eat and con&s;ume both bra&s;&s;e and yron. <HI>Vitruuius</HI> al&s;o in the third chapter of his eighth booke &s;aith, That in <HI>Te&s;&s;aly</HI> there is a well or &s;pring of running water, whereof no cattell will drinke, nor any ma|ner of bea&s;t will once come neere; hard by this fountain is a tree which beareth a purple flower. Thus far <HI>Vitruuius.</HI> Of the mount <HI>Olympus</HI> (which <HI>Homer,</HI> in the &s;econd booke of his <HI>Ody&s;&s;es,</HI> calleth <HI>The &s;eat of the Gods) Solinus</HI> out of the &s;ixt booke of <HI>Varro, De lingua Latina,</HI> citeth, That it ri&s;eth vp &s;o exceeding high into the aire, that the people neere adioyn|ing do call his lofty top, <HI>Heauen. Lucane</HI> &s;aith that <HI>it is higher than the clouds.</HI> For <HI>it is tenne furlongs high,</HI> as <HI>Plutarch</HI> in <HI>Aemilius,</HI> by the authority of <HI>Xenagoras,</HI> who mea&s;ured it, hath left recorded. <HI>No bird nor fowle doth flie higher than the toppe of this hill,</HI> as <HI>Apuleius</HI> in his booke intituled <HI>De Deo Socratis,</HI> doth affirme. In the very toppe of it there is an <HI>Altar built and con&s;ecrated to Iupiter,</HI> where if any of the entrals of bea&s;ts &s;acrificed be left, they are neither blowen a|bout by the blu&s;tring bla&s;ts of the roughe&s;t windes, nor di&s;&s;olued by the dampi&s;h aire or wa&s;hing &s;tormie raines: but the next yeere after, that time twelue-moneth, looke how they were left, &s;o they &s;hall finde them: and at all times and &s;ea&s;ons of the yeere, what&s;oeuer is there once con&s;ecrated and offered to that God, is pre&s;erued from all putrefaction and corruption of the aire: Letters al&s;o written and drawen in the a&s;hes doe &s;o remaine vntill the next &s;olemnity of the like rites and ceremonies the yeere following.

Of this mountaine, <HI>Varro,</HI> in his &s;ixth booke <HI>De lingua Latina,</HI> noteth that the Mu&s;es were named <HI>Olympiades.</HI> And thus far generally of the&s;e <HI>Tempe,</HI> which from the beginning had not this forme and goodly countenance as all ancient writers doe con&s;tantly with one con&s;ent affirme: but the riuer <HI>Peneus,</HI> being inclo&s;ed with mountaines, and entertaining many riuers into it, did all ouerflow the valley, making it to &s;tand full of water like a fenne or pond: and afterward when the mountaines <HI>Olympus</HI> and <HI>O&s;&s;a,</HI> which &s;ometime did touch one another, were di&s;ioyned and rent a&s;under (which happened by rea&s;on of an earthquake, as <HI>Strabo, Seneca,</HI> and <HI>Athenaeus</HI> haue written: others, as <HI>Herodotus, Claudian,</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;tratus,</HI> do a&s;cribe it to <HI>Neptune:</HI> others, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> and <HI>Lucane,</HI> to <HI>Hercules</HI>) and &s;o by that meanes <HI>Peneus</HI> found an i&s;&s;ue and way to vnload it &s;elfe into the maine ocean; whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e that the valley was emptied and cleane dried vp. By <HI>Stephanus</HI> in his booke of Cities, I finde that this tract and plot of ground was fir&s;t called LYTAE, before it was disburdened of tho&s;e waters. <HI>Eurypides</HI> in his tragedy intituled <HI>Troades,</HI> calleth it <HI>Semnan choran,</HI> the &s;acred and honourable countrey. Among&s;t the poets there is euery where much &s;peech of this mo&s;t goodly coa&s;t: to wit, in <HI>Virgill, Ouid, Horace, Catullus, Clau|dian, Statius, Lucan, Flaccus</HI> and <HI>Seneca,</HI> where you may ob&s;erue the&s;e epithites attributed and &s;poken of it; &s;ome cal|ling it <HI>Tempe The&s;&s;ala, Peneia, Heliconia, Phthiotica;</HI> others, <HI>Tempe Frigida, Tenebro&s;a, Nemoro&s;a, Opaca, Grati&s;sima, Lucentia, Oloria,</HI> and <HI>Teume&s;sia.</HI> The paradi&s;e of <HI>The&s;&s;aly, Peneus, Helicon, Phthiotis:</HI> the colde, &s;hadowy, woody, coole, kinde, &s;wanny and Teume&s;&s;iam paradi&s;e; although this latter, with the &s;ingular learned man <HI>Hermolaus Barba|rus,</HI> I doe thinke not to belong properly to this place, but rather vnto another mo&s;t delightfull place in <HI>Boeotia,</HI> where we learne out of <HI>Pau&s;anias, Strabo, Stephanus</HI> and <HI>He&s;ychius,</HI> that the mountaine <HI>Teume&s;&s;us</HI> is &s;eated.

But take this larger de&s;cription of it, out of <HI>Sozomen:</HI> It is a place, &s;ayth he, round be&s;et and &s;hadowed with many Cypre&s;&s;e trees, [and tho&s;e of infinite height, as <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> reporteth] yet here and there it is bedecked with &s;undry o|ther &s;orts of goodly trees: by rea&s;on of the thickne&s;&s;e of who&s;e boughs and leaues, which by no meanes &s;uffereth the Sunne-beames to come vnto the ground, it is all clo&s;e couered ouer with a &s;hadow as it were with a roofe. Vnder the trees, the earth, according to the &s;ea&s;ons of the yeere, bringeth forth of all &s;orts, mo&s;t plea&s;ant and &s;weet-&s;melling flowers, one after another. Item, it is a place, both for the great plenty and plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of the waters [<HI>Strabo</HI> calleth them, Running waters; <HI>Philo&s;tratus,</HI> Still or &s;tanding waters:] as al&s;o in re&s;pect of the temperature of the aire and kinde &s;ea&s;ons of the yeere; la&s;tly, in regard of the coole bla&s;tes and gales of windes which here doe ordinarily blowe, (yeelding al&s;o, as <HI>Cali&s;tus</HI> addeth, a &s;weet and plea&s;ant whi&s;tling noi&s;e) mo&s;t dele|ctable, and for all maner of plea&s;ure and recreation, pa&s;&s;ing fit and commodious. Here is al&s;o a &s;pring, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to fetch his waters from <HI>Ca&s;talius,</HI> a &s;pring by <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> in <HI>Greece:</HI> wherefore &s;ome men haue attributed to it the vertue and power of diuination, and doe verily per&s;wade them&s;elues, that it was of equall force and nature with that at <HI>Delphos.</HI> The vulgar &s;ort and common people to the&s;e do adde this fable; namely, That the daughter of <HI>Ladon (Ouid</HI> hath <HI>Peneus)</HI> a riuer in <HI>Arcadia,</HI> did flie hither from her louer, and here was transformed into a tree. Yet <HI>Apollo</HI> not thus quieted in minde, but crowning him&s;elfe with the boughes of that tree which he e&s;pecially delighted in, and embracing the tree, and the place where it &s;tood, beloued of him aboue all places in the world be&s;ide, did honour and grace it more than euer any other what|&s;oeuer. <HI>Gulielmus Tyrius,</HI> in the tenth chapter of his fourth booke, doth make mention of a fountaine or &s;pring called <HI>Daph|nis;</HI> which, he &s;ayth, by deuices and pipes into diuers places is &s;o cunningly conueyed, that it affoordeth, at certeine &s;et times, great plenty of water. The &s;ituation therefore and nature of the place, the argument and matter of the fabulous &s;tory, which was altogether of loue, and applied vnto wantonne&s;&s;e, oft times did imprint in the mindes of corrupt and ill di&s;po&s;ed yoong men (taking this &s;light occa&s;ion) twi&s;e &s;o great a de&s;ire of this wanton life as by nature they had before. For they, repeating tho&s;e matters, &s;poke of in tho&s;e fables, as it were in defence and excu&s;e of their follies, were the more inflamed and pricked forward to the &s;ame: &s;o that, ca&s;ting off all &s;hame and hone&s;ty, they are in the&s;e their la&s;ciuious acts caried with &s;uch heat and violence, that by no meanes they are able to temper them&s;elues, nor abide to &s;ee here any mode&s;t man in company with them. The nature therefore of this place being thus, it was held for a vile thing and great di&s;grace, for any hone&s;t and ciuill man to be &s;eene in it. For if any men, of tho&s;e places neere adioyning, were by chance &s;eene heere without his wench, he was counted for a very clowne or &s;ot, a man of no bringing vp, or good maners, nor fit for any gentle-mans company. Thus farre <HI>Sozomen.</HI> It was a defencible place, enclo&s;ed with a &s;trong wall or rampart, as appeareth out of the &s;euen and twen|tieth booke of <HI>Trogus Pompeius,</HI> who writeth that <HI>Beronice</HI> betaking her &s;elfe to this place for a refuge, was be&s;ieged by <HI>Se|leucus,</HI> but might by no meanes be taken. Item, he maketh mention of the Enginers of <HI>Daphne, (Balli&s;tarij Daphnen&s;es.)</HI> Moreouer, it was al&s;o, as <HI>Metaphra&s;tes</HI> writeth in the life of <HI>Artemius,</HI> graced with many <HI>goodly buildings, hou&s;es</HI> and <HI>bathes.</HI> In it was a <HI>chapell</HI> of very gorgeous and co&s;tly workeman&s;hip, wherein &s;tood the braue &s;tatue or image of <HI>Apollo Daphneus,</HI> or, of the Daphneian god, as <HI>Iulian</HI> the Emperour termeth it; equalling, as <HI>Ammianus</HI> &s;ayth, the greatne&s;&s;e of the counter|fet of <HI>Iupiter Olympius.</HI> Heere al&s;o was <HI>a temple and &s;anctuarie of Diana,</HI> as <HI>Strabo</HI> te&s;tifieth. Item, heere <HI>Germanicus Cae&s;ar</HI> kept his Courts, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> hath recorded: and here afterward, &s;aith <HI>Suidas, Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great built a palace, where he &s;et vp the &s;tatue of <HI>Helena</HI> his mother: (<HI>Augu&s;tale,</HI> he calleth it; which is, that I may note this by the way, as <HI>Quintilian,</HI> in the &s;econd chapter of his eighth booke of his In&s;titutions, doth interpret it, <HI>Tabernaculum Ducis,</HI> The pauilion of the generall.) The &s;ame <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> cau&s;ed this place to be named after his name, CONSTANTINIANA DAPHNE. <HI>Calli&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Grego|ras</HI> do report, that one <HI>Mamianus,</HI> in the time of <HI>Zeno</HI> the Emperour, did build that place which was called ANTIFORVM. Here al&s;o was the church of <HI>Saint Euphemia,</HI> where <HI>S. Thomas</HI> the Abbat was buried. Item, the church of <HI>S. Michael,</HI> which, as <HI>Procopius</HI> in his &s;econd booke of the Per&s;ian hi&s;tory writeth, was burnt by <HI>Co&s;roes.</HI> That this was a mo&s;t plea&s;ant place, be&s;ide tho&s;e things heere alledged, other hi&s;tories al&s;o doe plainly &s;hew: for <HI>Eutropius</HI> hath left recorded, That <HI>Cneus Pom|peius</HI> being delighted with the plea&s;antne&s;&s;e of the place, and great plenty of water, gaue vnto the Daphnen&s;es a certeine plot of ground, that they might there farther enlarge the &s;ame. <HI>Iulius Capitolinus</HI> writeth, That <HI>Verus,</HI> that voluptuous Empe|rour, did v&s;ually &s;pend the Summer in <HI>Daphne,</HI> the re&s;t of the yeere at <HI>Antiochia. Lampridius</HI> &s;ayth, That <HI>Alexander Seue|rus</HI> executed &s;ome of the Tribunes of his legions or companies, for that by their negligence they had &s;uffered diuers &s;ouldi|ours to keepe riot and take their plea&s;ure too much in <HI>Daphne.</HI> In <HI>Volcatius</HI> I reade of <HI>Auidius Ca&s;sius,</HI> That he cau&s;ed procla|mation to be made, that euery man &s;hould repaire to his Ancient, and to haue cau&s;ed billes to be &s;et vpon euery wall, That if any man were found in <HI>Daphne</HI> armed, <HI>(cinctus)</HI> he &s;hould returne from thence di&s;armed <HI>(di&s;cinctus.)</HI> (For <HI>Seruius</HI> at that place of <HI>Virgill, Di&s;cinctus Mulciber Afros,</HI> doth interpet the word, <HI>Di&s;cinctus, id e&s;t, militiae inhabilis.</HI>) Notwith&s;tanding, it was of the Gentiles had in no le&s;&s;e reuerence and e&s;timation for the certeinty of tho&s;e Oracles, which, as <HI>Suidas</HI> reporteth, were vttered and giuen forth in a coole and &s;oft bla&s;t, breathed forth of the waters there. For they &s;ay that <HI>Hadrian</HI> who af|terward was Emperour, before &s;uch timeas he was called to any publike office, hauing in a fountaine here dipped a Cypre&s;&s;e leafe, did together with the water &s;ucke in a certeine faculty of diuining things to come. <HI>Iulianus</HI> in his <HI>Mi&s;opogonos</HI> writeth, That he had &s;o many times and oft gone vnto this Oracle, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly call to mir de how oft. In his time al&s;o, <HI>Sozomen, Theodoret,</HI> and <HI>Saint Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI> do write, that this Oracle cea&s;ed to giue any an&s;wer at all. For <HI>Gallus</HI> the brother of this <HI>Iulian,</HI> being elected <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> by his father <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> becau&s;e he was by profe&s;&s;ion a Chri&s;tian, determined to clean&s;e and purge this place of that heatheni&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, and that by this meanes: He commanded the coffin of <HI>Saint Babyla,</HI> that con&s;tant Martyr, and of others, which in the per&s;ecution of <HI>Numerianus</HI> &s;uffered martyrdome with him, to be brought from <HI>Antiochia</HI> thither: by who&s;e pre&s;ence onely, which <HI>Gallus</HI> before had truely deemed, that diuell at an i&s;tant became wholly dumbe. But the fore&s;ayd <HI>Iulianus</HI> purpo&s;ing to make warre vpon the Per&s;ians, and according as his maner was, comming with great deuotion to this his <HI>Daphne,</HI> and killing many oxen and other cattell for &s;acrifices, demanded of the Oracle what the euent of this his warre would be; an&s;wer was made him, by the idoll, that by rea&s;on of the neerene&s;&s;e of the dead bodies

<PB REF="322"> (meaning <HI>Babyla</HI> with the re&s;t, although he named them not) he was neuer able any more hereafter to an&s;wer ought of things to come. <HI>Iulianus</HI> taking this hardly, commanded the Chri&s;tians to cary away the coffin of <HI>Babyla</HI> from thence into another place: which was &s;traightway accordingly performed. Not long after (the very next night, as one authour affirmeth) by chance the chapell was &s;et on fire, which con&s;umed the roofe of the &s;ame, and burnt the image to a&s;hes. This was the end of this <HI>Apollo</HI> of <HI>Daphne,</HI> as al&s;o of his temple. <HI>Saint Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI> writeth, that in his time there &s;tood one columne or pillar of it firme and &s;ound, which neither any violent tempe&s;t of winde and weather, or trembling earth-quake had &s;haken or ouer|throwen; &s;o that he &s;uppo&s;ed that it expected and looked to be amended and repaired againe by &s;ome &s;uccedent Emperours or others: And although <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmeth that this temple was reedified by <HI>Iu&s;tinian</HI> the Emperour, yet <HI>Cedrenus</HI> (who li|ued long &s;ince <HI>Saint Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI>) &s;ayth, that in his time there remained neither &s;ticke nor &s;tone of it. Which al&s;o my good friend <HI>M. Ioachimus Axonius Grauianus,</HI> a man for diuers and &s;undry farre trauels vndertaken and performed by him, and e|&s;pecially for his skill in diuers &s;trange languages very famous and honourable, an eye-witne&s;&s;e of this &s;ame place, doth iu&s;tifie to be true: for he being by my &s;elfe demanded of the moderne e&s;tate of this place, plainly an&s;wered, that be&s;ide certaine trees, there is not any thing of it at all to be &s;eene. But of the firing and burning downe of this temple, the report of diuers writers is diuers. <HI>Saint Chry&s;o&s;tome</HI> &s;ayth that it was done by the diuell. Many affirme it to haue beene kindled by thunder and lightning from heauen. The infidels commonly did father this act vpon the Chri&s;tians. <HI>Iulianus</HI> the Emperour in his <HI>Mi&s;opogonos</HI> writeth, that it was defaced by the negligence of the warders or watchmen, and the de&s;perate ra&s;hne&s;&s;e of &s;ome wicked and ba&s;e fellowes. But the Sextens, Church-keepers, and Prie&s;ts, as <HI>Theodoret</HI> te&s;tifieth, when they were whipped for their negligence, &s;ayd plainly, that the fire began not at the ground or bottome, but at the top, and &s;o con&s;equently by all likelihood did fall from heauen. And the clownes and countrey-people which dwelt not farre off, affirmed that they &s;aw lightning fall from heauen vpon that place. But of this let vs heare <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus,</HI> who in his two and twentieth booke hath the&s;e words of it: <HI>Iulianus</HI> had the Chri&s;tians in a iealou&s;ie for the fact, moued thereunto, as he thought, by enuy and malice. But the &s;ame was, although but lightly reported and of &s;mall credit, that this chapell was fired vpon this occa|&s;ion: <HI>A&s;clepiades</HI> the Philo&s;opher comming to &s;ee <HI>Iulianus</HI> the Emperour, &s;taying in the&s;e &s;uburbs, was woont whither&s;oe|uer he went to cary about him a little &s;iluer image of the heauenly godde&s;&s;e <HI>(Dea coele&s;tis)</HI> which he &s;et below vnderneath the feet of this idoll; and lighting torches and waxe candles, as the maner was, went his way: whereupon about mid-night, when no man could be there nor at hand to helpe, the &s;parkles flying vp gat hold vpon the old rotten timber, and the fire be|ing kindled and increa&s;ing greatly by rea&s;on of the drine&s;&s;e of the fewell, &s;treamed vpward and caught hold vpon what&s;oeuer it might reach, yea indeed were it neuer &s;o high, and burnt it cleane downe to the ground. Notwith&s;tanding, we learne out of <HI>Nicephorus Calli&s;tus,</HI> That this &s;ame place from that time was not altogether for&s;aken and contemned, but was woont of a long time after to be frequented, and that games, playes and &s;hewes were v&s;ually held and kept there.</P>
<P><HI>Aethicus</HI> (or, more truly, <HI>Iulius Orator</HI>) accounteth this <HI>Daphne</HI> (yet fal&s;ly and vntruely he calleth it <HI>Daphe,</HI> not <HI>Daphne</HI>) among&s;t the mo&s;t goodly and famous townes of the Ea&s;t &s;ea. <HI>Metaphra&s;tes</HI> al&s;o, in the life of <HI>S.

<P>And thus much of the name, &s;ituation, &amp; nature of this place: now there do yet remaine &s;ome things &s;omewhat pertinent to this matter, which I thought good to adioyne to tho&s;e former. <HI>Saint Hierome, Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his Chronicle, and <HI>Sextus Rufus</HI> do write, that <HI>Pompey</HI> the Great, returning from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> con&s;ecrated this groue, and thereto adioyned a goodly large forre&s;t. <HI>Ammianus</HI> attributeth the building of the temple to <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes: Sozomen,</HI> and <HI>Calli&s;tus,</HI> to <HI>Seleucus: Theodoret</HI> &s;aith, that the image or &s;tatue, within was of wood, but on the out&s;ide gilt all ouer: this al&s;o <HI>Simon Metaphra&s;tes,</HI> in the place before cited, doth iu&s;tifie to be true: where he maketh a large de&s;cription of the &s;ame: <HI>Cedrenus</HI> affirmeth, that this image was the workman&s;hip of <HI>Bryxides,</HI> or, <HI>Bryaxides,</HI> as I had rather reade with <HI>Vitruuius, Clemens Alexandrinus, Columella;</HI> and <HI>Pliny,</HI> who writeth that he was one of the foure that carued the <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> that is, the tombe of <HI>Mau&s;olus</HI> king of <HI>Caria,</HI> made by his wife <HI>Artemi&s;ia.</HI> It was inhibited by proclamation, That no Cypre&s;&s;e tree &s;hould be taken from hence, or cut downe, and that who&s;oeuer &s;hould fell any of them, was to be grieuou&s;ly puni&s;hed by an act made by <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI> the Emperour. The&s;e Cypre&s;&s;e trees were pre&s;erued here, as <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> writeth, in memory of <HI>Cypari&s;&s;us,</HI> a yong man of <HI>A&s;&s;yria,</HI> turned in|to this tree. <HI>Suidas</HI> recordeth, that this place was the natiue &s;oile of <HI>Theon</HI> the Philo&s;opher and Stoicke, who wrote a defence of <HI>Socrates.</HI> I doe al&s;o remember, that I haue read in &s;ome good authour, who&s;e name I haue forgotten, that there was one of the <HI>Sibylla's</HI> borne here. <HI>Ammianus</HI> telleth of a mon&s;ter borne here, as he him&s;elfe both &s;aw with his eies, and heard with his eares from the relation of others: namely, of a childe hauing two mouthes, two teeth, a beard, foure eies, and two very &s;hort or little eares. In <HI>Strabo</HI> I finde recorded from the relation of <HI>Nicolaus Dama&s;cenus,</HI> that from <HI>Porus,</HI> a King of <HI>India,</HI> certaine Amba&s;&s;adours came hither to <HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar. Procopius</HI> in the &s;econd booke of his Per&s;ian &s;tories writeth, that <HI>Co&s;roes</HI> the king of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> did here &s;acrifice to the Nymphes. With what pompe and traine <HI>Antiochus Epiphanes</HI> did once come to this place, what &s;hewes and bankets he made here, as al&s;o one <HI>Grypus</HI> at another time, if any man be de&s;irous to &s;ee, let him reade <HI>Athenaeus</HI> his fifth and tenth books, and I doubt but he will greatly woonder. Of this <HI>Daphne,</HI> I would to God that worke of <HI>Protagorides,</HI> which he wrote of the Daphnen&s;ian Playes, Fea&s;ts, and A&s;&s;emblies, whereof <HI>Athenaeus</HI> maketh mention in his fourth booke; together with that oration written by <HI>Libanius</HI> the Sophi&s;ter, which <HI>Iulian</HI> in his epi&s;tles &s;pea|keth of, and &s;o highly commendeth, were extant. <HI>Agathias</HI> in the prooeme to his hi&s;torie affirmeth that he wrote the hi&s;to|ries of this <HI>Daphne</HI> in Hexameter ver&s;e. I &s;ayd before out of <HI>Tacitus</HI> that <HI>Germanicus Cae&s;ar</HI> kept his Court in this forre&s;t, in whom, at this day in the 11 booke of his Annals, we reade the&s;e words: His tombe was at <HI>Antioch,</HI> where his corps was burnt: his court he held at <HI>Epidaphne,</HI> in which place he ended his dayes. Here for <HI>Epidaphne</HI> I reade <HI>Daphne,</HI> or, at <HI>Daphne:</HI> For of <HI>Epidaphne,</HI> for the name of a place, I finde no mention in any hi&s;tory, be&s;ide in <HI>Pliny,</HI> in his one and twentieth chapter of his fifth booke, where thou ha&s;t the&s;e words: <HI>Antiochia libera, Epidaphnes cognominata:</HI> as if this were a &s;ynonyme or equi|ualent to <HI>Antiochia;</HI> yet being indeed as corrupt and fal&s;ly written as that other, and ought to be thus amended, <HI>Antiochia libera apud Daphnen, Antioch</HI> by <HI>Daphne</HI> is free. That this is true, <HI>Strabo, Plutarch, Ammian,</HI> and others do &s;ufficiently te&s;ti|fie, as we haue &s;hewed more at large in the &s;econd edition of our Geographicall trea&s;urie, in the word ANTIOCHIA.</P>

<P>_AFTER that IVLIVS CAESAR had by continuall warres appea&s;ed almo&s;t all tho&s;e broiles and &s;editious quarels which for certaine yeeares pa&s;&s;ed had much troubled the Romane &s;tate, and had &s;ent Pompey and tho&s;e other vnfortunate enuiers of his valour and pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e in martiall affaires, either dead vnto the Diuell, or aliue by bani&s;hment had remooued them farre off into forren countries, as a valiant Conquerour of all entereth triumphantly into ROME: where challenging and a&s;&s;uming vnto him&s;elfe a &s;oueraigne authority and honour aboue all (him&s;elfe indeed as a Monarch at his plea&s;ure commanding all) was the fir&s;t that began the FOVRTH MONARCHY, which of the place where it fir&s;t &s;eated it &s;elfe, was &s;irnamed, <HI>The Romane Monarchy.</HI> In this dignity, which was the greate&s;t that could be giuen to any mortall man, carrying him&s;elfe mo&s;t tyrannou&s;ly and proudly (for he commanded that his &s;tatue or image &s;hould be &s;et vp among&s;t the odious and wicked kings, and that his chaire of E&s;tate &s;houd be made of beaten gold, and withall reque&s;ted the Citizens to giue vnto him diuine honour; and to wor&s;hip him as a god) certaine Al|dermen or Senators, loathing that his lordly gouernment in the Senat hou&s;e wounded him in three &amp; twenty &s;euerall places, whereof he died, in the yeare 709. after the building of the city of Rome. Notwith&s;tanding he being thus made away, the chiefe authority and Empire cea&s;&s;ed not to re&s;ide among&s;t the Romanes, for AVGVSTVS, the &s;ole adopted heire of Cae&s;ar, pre&s;ently &s;teppeth into the Imperiall &s;eat, and by force of armes layeth hold vpon the &s;oueraigne dignity and what&s;oeuer el&s;e his predece&s;&s;our had by hooke or crooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and en|ioyed. Vnder his gouernment all things being &s;till and hu&s;hed, there being now not &s;o much as the lea&s;t noice of tumultuous warres &s;tirring in the world, all men generally admiring this ble&s;&s;ed and happy peace, do withall in like maner of all policies, highly extoll the monarchy, as authour and pre&s;eruer of the &s;ame. Vnder the name of this title, the Romanes alone for many ages together mo&s;t honourable and fearefull to others, were victours and conquerours where&s;oeuer they became; vntill at length certaine idle and cruell minded men being promoted vnto that dignity, did choo&s;e rather tyrannou&s;lie to &s;hew their force and power at home again&s;t their kinsfolke, friends, &s;ubiects, and be&s;t men of all &s;orts, then abroad a|gain&s;t the publicke enemy and di&s;turber of the &s;tate. The&s;e men by all maner of vnlawfull meanes &s;ucceeding one another, at la&s;t the Empire and managing of the common-wealth was onely in the hands of Tyrants and V&s;urpers: neither was there any man now that euer would once trouble him&s;elfe to defend the &s;ame from the furious a&s;&s;ault of the raging enemy: and no maruell. For euen the Empire it &s;elfe, and what&s;oeuer did of right belong vnto the &s;ame, was by the &s;ouldiers bought and &s;old for money, or giuen for fauour and affection. While all things &s;tood thus in the Roman Empire, ODOACER, king of the <HI>Hunnes,</HI> with a mighty army inuadeth the &s;ame, and in all places where&s;oeuer he became, ouerthroweth and beateth downe the Romane forces and garri&s;ons: for at this time in the idle and di&s;&s;olute &s;ouldiers there remained neither &s;trength nor true fortitude. AVGVSTVLVS the Emperour, hearing of the&s;e newes, being &s;mitten into a great feare, flieth, and that he might the better e&s;cape vn|knowen, in the flight throweth off his imperiall robes and ornaments. In the meane time Odoacer &s;peedeth him&s;elfe toward Rome, be&s;iegeth it, taketh it, and within a few daies after he was wholly and quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, changeth the name of it, and after his owne name cau&s;ed it by pro|clamation to be called ODOACRIA: but together with the ancient name this city leaueth the former beauty and lu&s;ture, there is nothing now heere to be &s;eene but mi&s;erable de&s;truction and ruine. This pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e and ea&s;ie inua&s;ion of the city of Rome by Odoacer, within foure|teen yeares after, giueth occa&s;ion to THEODORICVS, king of the <HI>Gothes,</HI> who was then in Thrace, to attempt the &s;ame. Therefore mu&s;tering his men, with many thou&s;ands of Goths, he entreth Italy, driueth Odoacer out of Rome, and again the &s;econd time neere to Verona &s;etteth vpon him, and putting him &amp; his forces to flight, followeth him to Rauenna, where he be&s;iegeth him continually for the &s;pace of three yeares together, but at length being forced to yeeld the city he was by him taken and put to death. Neither did this &s;atisfie frowning Fortune that Rome was thus once or twi&s;e taken, &s;acked and con&s;umed with fire, except the LONGOBARDI, <HI>Lombardes,</HI> a &s;trange and cruell people do al&s;o inuade Italy, to deface and ouerthrow all things what&s;oeuer the former enemies had left vntouched and &s;tanding. All things are now deformed and ca&s;t downe what&s;oeuer in former times were mo&s;t beautifull and glorious, the Romane citizen is compelled to for&s;ake that ancient and famous title &s;o long en|ioied by them, and by meanes of this &s;o irrecouerable a dammage the name of an Emperour was for euer bani&s;hed out of Italy. The ca&s;e thus &s;tan|ding with the Romanes, de&s;titute of all helpe at home, and in vaine expecting the &s;ame from the Greeks, (who for their Empire contented them|&s;elues only with Con&s;tantinople) the Pope of Rome for defence of the Church was forced in this great di&s;tre&s;&s;e to entreat aid of Charles, king of the Frankes, who afterward was &s;irnamed CHARLES THE GREAT. This good king pricked on forward with a godly zeale for the mainte|nance of Chri&s;tian religion, pa&s;&s;ing with a great army ouer the Alpes, putteth the Lombards to flight, taketh their king De&s;iderius with his wife and children, vtterly ouerthroweth their kingdome and cleane extingui&s;heth that impious race. The Pope ob&s;eruing his inuincible courage, and his &s;iugular loue that he bare to the Church and religion, with the generall con&s;ent and admirable applau&s;e of all men, in the yeare after Chri&s;ts in|carnation 801. crowneth him with the Imperiall diademe, and giueth him the title of AVGVSTVS and GREAT EMPEROVR of the We&s;t. This king was the fir&s;t that of the Dutch was called Emperour, and that tran&s;lated that dignity from the Greekes vnto the Germanes. He valiantly a&s;&s;ailed the Hunnes, and at la&s;t with continuall wars &s;o afflicted them that they were neuer after able to gather head againe. The Normanes, Frei|&s;es, Danes, Angles, Saxons, and others mole&s;ting the Empire, he wonderfully vexed and weakened. Hauing on all &s;ides greatly enlarged his Em|pire, and for the &s;pace of fowreteene yeares &s;waied the &s;cepter quietly at home, void of tumults and noi&s;e of warre, he committed the gouernment of the &s;ame to his &s;onne Lewis, &s;irnamed the Religious, and ended his life at Aqui&s;gran. After the reigne of this Charles, the digni y and title of the Empire remained not among&s;t the Germanes without continuall warres and bloud&s;hed, diuers kings coueting to annex the &s;ame to their crowne and nation, by dint of &s;word a&s;&s;aied by all meanes to bring their purpo&s;e to pa&s;&s;e. To &s;eat it among&s;t the French, Charles the Bald, &s;pareth no co&s;t, ventureth life and limme, and &s;etteth all the world together by the eares: yet the Germanes valiantly fighting for the Imperiall ti le and dignity; do after many &s;ore conflicts quite and cleane driue him out of Germany. Lewis the Fourth mo&s;t furiou&s;ly &s;etteth vpon Berengarius an v&s;urper lately proclaimed Emperour in Italy, ouercommeth him in the field, and forceth him to betake him to his heeles. The Italians oft de&s;ired that this dignity once lo&s;t might againe be re&s;tored to them. (and no maruell: &s;eeing that euery nation doth account it a mo&s;t honourable thing to haue the name of an Empire re&s;ident among&s;t them.) Yet maugre all externall &s;pite this dignity for many ages together remained in the hands of the Germanes, the Princes of this country manfully defending and pre&s;eruing it by force of armes from all iniuries and forren inua&s;ions what&s;o|euer. Vntill at length the forenamed Princes, fore&s;eeing what was be&s;t for the &s;tate and good of the Empire, did chu&s;e for their Emperor, Otto the Fourth, the naturall &s;onne of Otto the Third, a yong man brought vp at Rome, &amp; had been &s;omtime in the cu&s;tody and tuition of Henry Duke of Bayern. This Emperor perceiuing that it would not be an ea&s;ie thing to appea&s;e and end the warres and controuer&s;ies that did ari&s;e about the ele|ction and choice of the Emperor, except by &s;ome other meanes &amp; order this choice were made, did therefore inuent a certaine order and maner of election, whereby heereafter all cau&s;e of di&s;&s;ention and tumult, was wholly taken from all men, and by which for euer it might quietly be retai|ned among&s;t the Germanes. This order is heere expre&s;&s;ed in this Mappe, and is in effect thus much: In the fir&s;t ranke are the Seuen PRINCE ELECTOVRS and Officers of the &s;acred Romane Empire, in&s;tituted by Otto the Third: whereof the Three vpon the right hand, are Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|call per&s;ons or Churchmen, to wit, the ARCHBISHOP OF TRIER, (a city &s;ituate vpon the riuer Mo&s;elle) chiefe Chancellour for the Empire in the kingdome of France: The ARCHBISHOP OF COLEN, vpon the Rhein, Chiefe Chancellour in Italy; and the ARCHBISHOP OF MENTZ, Chiefe Chancellour in Germany: The other Foure vpon the left hand, are Secular or Lay men: the Fir&s;t, is the KING OF BOHE|MIA, the Cup-bearer: the Second is the COVNTY PALATINE of Rhein, the Sewer: the Third is the DVKE OF SAXONY, the Sword-bearer: the Fourth is the MARQVESSE OF BRANDENBVRG, the Lord Great Chamberlaine to the Emperour. In the Second ranke doe follow, fir&s;t the Foure Dukes of the Empire, to wit, the DVKE OF SVVITZERLAND, the DVKE OF BRVNSVVICKE, the DVKE OF BAYERN, and the DVKE OF LOREIN. Then vpon the left hand, the Foure MARQVESSES, <HI>videlicet,</HI> the MARQVISSE OF MEIS|SEN, the MARQVESSE OF MORAVV, the MARQVESSE OF BADEN, and the MARQVESSE OF BRANDENBVRG. In the Third and la&s;t ranke do follow the Eight EARLES of the Empire: whereof the LANDTGRAVE OF DVRINGEN, the LANDGRAVE OF HESSEN, the Earles of LVCHTENBVRG, and of ALSATIA, are Earles Prouinciall: the other Foure, MEIDENBVRG, NVRVBERG, RENECK, and STOMEBVRG, are Earles Mar&s;hall or of the field.</P>

<HEAD>Of the FOVNDATION and ORDER of the GERMANE EMPIRE in the We&s;t. THE SECOND MAPPE.</HEAD>
<P>_OTTO the Fourth, or, as &s;ome haue written, OTTO the Third, of whom wee haue &s;poken in the former Mappe, vnder&s;tanding that Gregory the Fifth, Pope of Rome, whom he had not long &s;ince promoted to that dignity, was driuen out of his Sea, and Cre&s;centius a Con&s;ul or Alderman of Rome by the Romanes made Emperour, pa&s;&s;eth the Alpes with a great power, furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;aulteth Italy, forceth the Romanes, and any other cities that had &s;tood out again&s;t him for the aduer&s;e part, to &s;et open their gates and to yeeld them&s;elues to his mercy. Cre&s;centius, when he heard that the enemy was receiued into the city, was ex|ceedingly amazed, and therefore betaketh him&s;elfe with Pope Iohn, the v&s;urper which he had promoted to that dignity, vnto Adrians ca&s;tle, which not long before he had fortified and repaired, for their la&s;t re|fuge and &s;uccour. But being not able to &s;u&s;taine the batterie and violent a&s;&s;aults which dayly the Empe|rours &s;ouldiers made again&s;t him, at length yeeldeth the ca&s;tle and him&s;elfe to Otto: who pre&s;ently com|mandeth Cre&s;centius the authour of this commotion to haue his eies put out, his no&s;e cut off, and to be caried on hor&s;ebacke round about the towne with his face to the hor&s;etaile: This being done his iudgement was to haue his hands and feet to be cut off, and at the townes end to be hanged vpon a paire of gallowes, where, before he was altogether dead, the &s;ouldiers do pitifully wound and man|gle him from top to toe. Moreouer Pope Iohn, the v&s;urper, being di&s;placed, Gregory vpheld and maintained by Otto, the Empe|rours authority, climbeth vp againe into the Papall throne, from which before he had mo&s;t iniuriou&s;ly, by Cre&s;centius, beene expel|led. Then Gregory to requite the kindne&s;&s;e of the Emperour and his Germanes, and withall that he might &s;ufficiently reuenge him|&s;elfe of the Romanes for the intolerable wrongs that they had done vnto him, con&s;ulteth with the Emperour about a new law and forme of election of the Emperour, to be made by the Princes of Germany, that this choice might only and for euer remaine in their power, and againe that they &s;hould alwaies choo&s;e one of their corporation or body, as it were, vnto that dignity, which cu&s;tome remaineth euen to the&s;e our daies duely kept and ob&s;erued. By vertue of this their choice, he is by and by vpon that their election to be called only, CAESAR and KING OF THE ROMANES, but hauing receiued the Imperiall diademe from the hands of the Pope, he was euer after to beare the title of IMPERATOR AVGVSTVS. But before the&s;e ordinances were publi&s;hed, Otto calling toge|ther the Princes and States of Germany, &s;hewed them how confu&s;edly and di&s;orderly the choice and election of the Emperor had hi|therto beene made, and how many there haue beene, which haue a&s;&s;aied by all meanes po&s;&s;ible to preferre their friends and kinsfolke vnto that dignity, which thing cannot but in continuance of time, breed great di&s;&s;ention and danger to the Chri&s;tian common|wealth: and that it were therefore good that &s;ome of the Princes of Germanie were cho&s;en, which might haue the whole power and authority of this election; and withall admoni&s;heth them, that the fewer there were of tho&s;e Electours, &s;o much le&s;&s;e the contention would be that &s;hould ari&s;e about the choice. Moreouer he endeuoured to per&s;wade them that the&s;e Electours might bee appointed and taken out of the Peeres and Officers of the Empire, for that they of all other be&s;t knew what was good for the body and &s;tate of that kingdome and empire. All men generally liking of that cour&s;e and coun&s;ell by him propo&s;ed, the Emperour and the Pope nomi|nated vnto them fir&s;t, <HI>Three eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Princes,</HI> bi&s;hops of Germany, which they wi&s;hed might be the Lord Chiefe Chancellours of the Empire, to wit, <HI>The bi&s;hop of Mentz,</HI> for all matters in Germany; <HI>The bi&s;hop of Colen,</HI> for Italy; <HI>The bi&s;hop of Trier,</HI> for France; To the&s;e they adioined <HI>Foure Secular Princes,</HI> which &s;hould in all things aid the Emperour, attend vpon his per&s;on, and that &s;hould acknowledge him for their Lord and Monarch of the World: viz. <HI>The Duke of Saxony,</HI> Sword bearer to his Maie&s;ty, &s;ignifying that hee is the fountaine of Iu&s;tice: <HI>The Marque&s;&s;e of Brandenburgh,</HI> Lord Great Chamberlaine: <HI>The County Palatine of Rhein,</HI> Sewer: and <HI>The K ng of Bohemia,</HI> Cup-bearer: the&s;e were to attend vpon the Emperour and to gard his per&s;on. By the&s;e the King of the Romans was cho&s;en, the Cae&s;ar (or he that was next to be Emperour) was appointed: in their hands the whole right, intere&s;t and authority of choo&s;ing that king re&s;ided, le&s;t any man heereafter, as heeretofore had beene v&s;uall, &s;hould challenge this dignity vnto him&s;elfe as due by inheritance from his ance&s;tours. Charles the Fourth many yeares after this compri&s;ed this in&s;trument or act into a bullion or tablet of gold, which to this day is extant, wherein hee explaned euery particular more expre&s;ly and &s;ignificantly. It is reported that this ordinance was decreed vpon, and made in the yeare of Grace 1001 and did much di&s;content the Frenchmen, who tooke it hei|nou&s;ly as a great indignity offered vnto them. Yet be&s;ide the&s;e there were then, and afterward in &s;uccedent ages were, made many and &s;undry other ordinances and decrees in the Romane Empire, and diuers other Offices appointed and erected for the &s;tate and greater maie&s;ty of the Empire. For be&s;ide the&s;e &s;euen <HI>Electours,</HI> there were appointed, Foure <HI>Dukes,</HI> Foure <HI>Marque&s;&s;es,</HI> Foure <HI>Landt|graues,</HI> Foure <HI>Burggraues,</HI> Foure <HI>Earles,</HI> Foure <HI>Barons,</HI> Foure <HI>Knights</HI> of the field, Foure <HI>Cities,</HI> Foure <HI>Villages,</HI> and Foure <HI>Yeomen</HI> or Ru&s;ticks, all which offices we haue expre&s;&s;ed in their true characters in the&s;e two mappes appointed for that purpo&s;e only. Notwith|&s;tanding other Emperours following, not content with the&s;e con&s;titutions and ordinances, haue daiely made new Dukes and Earles, yea and many that were but Earles before they haue aduanced to the title and honour of Dukes. To the&s;e forenamed dignities, that they might, as much as was po&s;&s;ible, &s;trengthen the &s;tate of the Empire, they haue adioined certaine other new officers, to wit the&s;e which follow: Foure HIGH MARSHALS, as <HI>Bappenheim, Gulich, Mei&s;&s;en,</HI> and <HI>Vni&s;tingen:</HI> Foure LORDS OF THE SOILE, <HI>Mil|lan, Scala, Padua,</HI> and <HI>Mirandula:</HI> Foure BORROVGHS of the Empire, <HI>Aldenburgh, Meidenburgh, Rotenburgh,</HI> and <HI>Mecklenburgh:</HI> Foure KNIGHTS or Seruants, <HI>Waldeck, Hirten</HI> of Fulchen, <HI>Arn&s;perg,</HI> and <HI>Rabnaw:</HI> Foure SOVLDIERS, <HI>Andlaw, Meldingen, Stron|decke,</HI> and <HI>Fornberg:</HI> Foure LORD ABBOTS, <HI>Fulden, Campidon, Wi&s;&s;enburgh,</HI> and <HI>Murbach:</HI> Foure HVNTSMEN, <HI>Hurn, Vrach, Scomburgh,</HI> and <HI>Met&s;ch</HI> neere to Curia: Foure VILLAGES, <HI>Ingelheim, Altdorff, Lichtenaw,</HI> and <HI>Deckendorff:</HI> Foure MOVNTAINS of the Empire, <HI>Nun&s;terberg, Friedberg, Heydelberg,</HI> and <HI>Nurnberg:</HI> Foure OFFICES hereditary to the Dukedome of Switzerland, <HI>The Sewer of Waldprugh, The Cupbearer of Radach, The Mar&s;hall of Merkdorff, and The Chamberlaine of Kemnat.</HI> Yer many of the&s;e di|gnities are altered and changed into others, or wholly aboli&s;hed and extinct by the death of tho&s;e which held them, as it is at large to be &s;eene in Mun&s;ters Co&s;mography. If any man be moreouer de&s;irous to know the names of the Imperiall cities, let him repaire to the &s;ame authour, he &s;halbe &s;atisfied to his full content. Item Charles the Fourth, Emperour of Germany did make be&s;ides the&s;e many other con&s;titutions. When the Emperour &s;itteth in his Maie&s;ty and chaire of E&s;tate then the Archbi&s;hop of Trier &s;itteth ouer again&s;t him, the Archbi&s;hop of Mentz vpon his right hand, and the Archbi&s;hop of Colen on his left: The King of Bohemia taketh his &s;eat vpon the right hand of the Archbi&s;hop, and by him the County palatine of Rhein placeth him&s;elfe, the Duke of Saxony &s;it|teth vpon the left hand of the Archbi&s;hop, and by him the Marque&s;&s;e of Brandenburgh. But of the&s;e offices, diuers authours do write diuer&s;ly; wherefore it being not our purpo&s;e to make a large di&s;cour&s;e of this matter, we &s;end the Reader, for further &s;atisfaction heer|in, to the forenamed Seba&s;tian Mun&s;ter and other Hi&s;toriographers of Germany, who haue handled this argument more amply.</P>

<HEAD>The KINGS MONASTERY of Saint Laurence, for Friars of the order of Saint Hierome, <HI>in E&s;curiall in Spaine.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_OLd &s;tories do much talke of &s;euen wonders of the World, whereof hitherto it hath much bragged, yet notwith&s;tanding they, (&s;uch is the mutability of fortune) at this day are all con&s;umed, and by tract of time; brought to nothing, &s;o that now there remaineth not any monument or mention of them at all. This our age al&s;o hath certaine wonders and &s;trange things equall or &s;uperiour to the mo&s;t of tho&s;e. Spaine, among&s;t other, hath a mo&s;t &s;tately and princely building, a worthy worke of the Catholike King, of in|finite co&s;t and charges con&s;ecrated to holy and religious v&s;es; to wit, a Church, not &s;uch as that was in A&s;ia, &s;ometime dedicated to the Ephe&s;ian Diana, and at la&s;t &s;et on fire and defaced by Hero&s;tratus, but one as gorgeous and &s;umptuous as that, con&s;ecrated to Saint Laurence, that zealous Martyr and glory of the Spani&s;h nation, of whom they crake &s;o much. The cau&s;e of the dedication, as they &s;ay, was a vow. For in the voiage vnto Saint Quintins, the Metropolitane and chiefe city of Vermandois, vndertaken by the Catholike King, Philip the &s;econd, of the hou&s;e of Au&s;trich, again&s;t Henry the &s;econd, the French King, there was a notable battell fought betweene the Frenchmen and the Burgundians, in the yeare of our Lord 1557. Vpon the tenth day of Augu&s;t, in which the flower of chiualrie and chiefe Nobility of France being &s;lain and ouercome, the victory fell vnto Philip and his Burgundians: which victory was &s;uch, as I am not able to &s;ay whether the hou&s;e of Au&s;trich euer &s;aw a greater or not. This day euery yeere is kept holy for Saint Laurence the Martyr, to whom and his good praiers this good Prince doth thinke him&s;elfe beholding for this victory. There|fore, the King, a&s;&s;oone as he was returned home, remembring his vow, tooke care for nothing more then to performe his promi&s;e made to God and his holy Martyr Saint Laurence. Therefore he performeth the &s;ame very magnificently, and mo&s;t bountifullie laieth on co&s;t, be&s;toweth many yeares and almo&s;t infinite trea&s;ures vpon this worke: &s;o that now it is not onely one, and that a mo&s;t gorgeous and &s;tately Mona&s;tery, but foure, according to the number of the corners of the building, be&s;ide a maruellous princely Palace with a Library well &s;tored with diuers and &s;undry ancient manu&s;cripts and rare bookes. The village, which by rea&s;on of the great multitudes of labourers and workemen which re&s;orted thither of all trades, now is become a pretty towne, commonly called ESCVRIAL (<HI>E&s;curiacum,</HI> in Latine) is fiue miles from Madrid, an ancient city which Ptolemey in his time called <HI>Mantua Carpeta|norum.</HI> Round about it are diuers very &s;teepe and high hils, out of which almo&s;t all the &s;tone was digged, that was v&s;ed about this building. The Friars which do inhabite and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the&s;e Mona&s;teries are of the order of Saint Hierome, who very deuoutly euery day at nine of the clocke in the quire of that Church do &s;ing P&s;almes and powre out their praiers to Almighty God for the health and pre&s;eruation of all Chri&s;tian Princes. There al&s;o the King hath erected an Vniuer&s;ity, and hath allowed large maintenance not onelie for the Profe&s;&s;ors and Readers of Diuinity, Philo&s;ophy and other liberall &s;ciences: but al&s;o for the &s;cholars and &s;tudents of the &s;ame. Yet it is a place of no great re&s;ort, being of purpo&s;e built a good way di&s;tant from the high rode way, le&s;t the great re&s;ort thither of &s;trangers, which oft times commeth to pa&s;&s;e, &s;hould corrupt the maners and minds of the &s;tudents, or alienate them from their books. But let vs come to &s;ome particulars heere well worth the ob&s;eruation. Within the inner Court, on the fore&s;ide of this building, you &s;hall &s;ee a goodly cloi&s;ter or walke couered ouer head, which beginning at the We&s;t &s;ide of the Abbey, runneth all along by the North &s;ide, paued with &s;mall &s;tones partly round and partly &s;quare. The fore&s;ide and chiefe &s;hew of this Abbey is toward the We&s;t, and in the foure corners of this building there are foure turrets. Ouer the fore-dore of this Church, vpon their &s;euerall foot&s;tals doe &s;tand the &s;tatues or counterfets of the &s;ixe kings of I&s;rael carued out of white marble and blacke touch&s;tone, each of them being eigh|teene foot high. The great porch of this Abbey vpheld and &s;tanding vpon pillars of Ionicke and Doricke worke is all of Geat or blacke Agate. Vpon the North &s;ide there is a Courtyard, through which they go to the Kings palace, the foure walkes of the Col|ledge and the Vniuer&s;itie: all which are built vpon this North &s;ide. Here al&s;o you &s;hall &s;ee &s;ome of the &s;hops and worke-hou&s;es of tho&s;e handicrafts, trade&s;men and others that do belong a&s;well to the Church and Colledge as to the Mona&s;terie. On the South &s;ide al&s;o are certaine gardens, orchardes, the walke belonging to the Ho&s;pitall, certaine Stilling hou&s;es, with an Apothecaries &s;hop and a gallery by which they pa&s;&s;e from the Mona&s;tery vnto the gue&s;&s;en parlour. Let vs come now vnto the inner ornaments of this &s;tate|ly peece of work. And fir&s;t, with the &s;taires by which they go vp from the great doore of the Church, a goodly gallery, which leadeth vnto the open walke which is betweene the Colledge and the Mona&s;tery, doth offer it &s;elfe to thy view. In this gallery you may go vp by a broad paire of &s;taires to go into the Church, and from thence you come vnto another floore, which leadeth to the cro&s;&s;e en|try which is before the Church, from whence they of the Mona&s;tery go one way, tho&s;e of the Colledge another way, into the church, and &s;o from thence into the lower roome of the Quire. The place or platforme of this Quire is &s;quare, hauing within the &s;quare three Cloi&s;ters. By this place of the lower Quire on each &s;ide there is an open Court, from whence the lower Quire and the two Chap|pels &s;ituate by this Court, do receiue their light. In this Quire there are two &s;tately Altars. Ouer this Quire, which is arched, there is another Church with a Quire belonging to it. Which Church be&s;ide the great Chappell, the Inner and Outter roomes of the Quire, is &s;quare, &s;tanding vpon foure pillars, and other nece&s;&s;arie &s;taies and vpholders. In it are two paire of Organes, each of them hauing, as they terme them, two and thirty Regi&s;ters. Moreouer in this Churh are &s;ix and thirty Altars, with a mo&s;t &s;tately Dore, by which they go vnto the great lower Vault, at &s;uch time as praiers are &s;aid. This Church is thirty foot higher then the lower Quire: and the vpper Quire is as many foot higher, then the Church it &s;elfe. The floore is laid checkerwi&s;e with white marble and a kind of blacke &s;tone, in like maner as the floores of the outter and inner Quires are: Heere are to be &s;eene diuers and &s;undry Seruice bookes and Ma&s;&s;e bookes, both written and printed, with others many belonging to &s;uch Church bu&s;ine&s;&s;es. In the roofe of this Quire the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres and all the hoa&s;t of heauen are mo&s;t curiou&s;ly painted, like as al&s;o vpon the wals of the &s;ame the coun|terfets of diuers vertues are &s;o cunningly portraitured as one would thinke them to be liue per&s;ons, be&s;ide certaine hi&s;tories of Saint LAVRENCE and S. HIEROME. The Seates are made of very fine wood, carued and &s;et out with turned pillars of Corinthiacke worke mo&s;t artificially. Vpon the South &s;ide of the Church is the Porch doore beautified and adorned with diuers and &s;undrie goodly pi|ctures. In this Porch is a Fountaine made of diuers kinds of ia&s;per and marble, running at &s;euen cockes for the v&s;e and benefit of &s;uch as are purpo&s;ed to go to Ma&s;&s;e there. The floore is paued and garni&s;hed with blacke and white marble. The Ve&s;trie al&s;o is a very &s;tately place, and richlie adorned, in which are diuers coffers and che&s;ts wherein are laid vp and kept the copes, ve&s;tments and other ornaments belonging to the altars and Prie&s;ts which they put on when they &s;ay Ma&s;&s;e. Out of this ve&s;try they go vp to the high altar which &s;tandeth vp a loft in the vpper end of the Church. The place where this altar &s;tandeth is paued with the be&s;t ia&s;per &s;tone of di|uers colours. To this are adioning certaine Chappels and clo&s;ets where the Noblemen and Princes do &s;it to heare ma&s;&s;e. This way

<PB REF="328"> they goe into the chappell which is vpon the North &s;ide of the church, where diuers pretious reliques of Saints are kept inclo&s;ed in their &s;euerall che&s;ts and boxes. Such another there is for all the world vpon the South &s;ide. Hard by the high altar there is a little roome mo&s;t richly adorned, where the holy communion is admini&s;tred. Within this roome by the high altar there is a clo&s;et, where the Sacrament is kept and re&s;erued, &s;et out mo&s;t &s;tatelily with &s;euen pillars, of the be&s;t ia&s;per, and the &s;tatues of the twelue Apo&s;tles, as curiou&s;ly wrought as arte might deui&s;e. The Doores of this clo&s;et made of the be&s;t and pure&s;t Cry&s;tall, which they call Cry&s;tall of the mountaine, are enclo&s;ed and hanged in certaine hinges of ca&s;t mettal double gilt and laid ouer with gold. This work is thought to be the mo&s;t curious and artificiall that el&s;ewhere is to be &s;eene in all the world. The &s;uruey or and famous architect of this building, Ma&s;ter Ieames Trezzo, was &s;ixe whole yeares at the lea&s;t in cutting and poli&s;hing of the ia&s;per which was v&s;ed in this worke onely. Moreouer the high altar is a worke as co&s;tly and curious as this, made in like maner of ia&s;per and marble, and garni&s;hed with &s;undry &s;tately pictures and &s;tatues.</P>
<P>The MONASTERIE, or place of re&s;idence for the monkes and friars, hath a very goodly <HI>Steeple</HI> wherein doe hang a fine ring of <HI>Bels,</HI> with a <HI>Clocke</HI> and <HI>Diall,</HI> with an Index &s;hewing the Naturall and Planetary howres. The Wardrope, Hall or Roome where the monkes and friars do v&s;e to dine and &s;uppe, with the &s;pittle, are mo&s;t goodlily built with Sollers, Galleries and Walkes. Moreouer heere is a faire Cloi&s;ter or Square, where publike praiers are daily read: In the midde&s;t of this &s;quare is a very fine garden mo&s;t artifi|cially diuided into beds and curious knots. In the midde&s;t of it is a goodly piece of worke, built eight &s;quare in maner of a temple, with fountaines of the be&s;t ia&s;per. To this Cloi&s;ter is adioining the Chapter-hou&s;e, with another roome very like vnto it. The Seats of the monkes are round about by the &s;ides: but the Seat of the Priour doth farre excell the re&s;t, a famous piece of worke made of marble, gloriou&s;ly &s;et out with pictures, and curiou&s;ly arched ouer the head. The LIBRARY which is vpon the toppe of the Abbey, is 185. foot long, and 32. foot broad. It hath three &s;undrie roomes; In the fir&s;t are all the Liberall Sciences protraitured. At the feet of euery picture, are the Bookes of that facultie very orderly and finely placed, all of them gilt, and bound alike. Heere al&s;o is an huge Parchment booke, wherein all manner of liuing creatures that are in all the whole world, el&s;ewhere to be &s;eene, are mo&s;t curiou&s;lie drawen and expre&s;&s;ed in their true and liuely colours. In the Second are onely manu&s;cript Latine, Greeke and Hebrew bookes of Di|uinity. In the beginning of euery booke is &s;et the picture and counterfet of the authour of the &s;ame. In like maner the third roome is furni&s;hed only with manu&s;cript copies of &s;undrie writers, and different argument in diuers languages, to wit, Hi&s;toriographers, Po|ets, Mathematicians &amp;c. The&s;e al&s;o haue, where they might po&s;&s;ibly be gotten, the liuely portraitures and counterfets of their au|thours &s;et before them. This Library was much augmented by the addition of the Library of Didacus Hurtadus Mendoza, who ha|uing &s;ometime beene Amba&s;&s;adour for Charles the fifth, Emperour of Rome, vnto the Venetians, receiued from the High country of Greece a &s;hip full of manu&s;cript Greeke copies: &s;o that excepting the Vaticane in Rome, which is the Popes Library, there is not, as mo&s;t men thinke, a more &s;tately and better furni&s;hed library then this in all Europe.</P>
<P>I come now to the VNIVERSITY, and the KINGS PALLACE, both which are vpon the North &s;ide. In the VNIVERSITY there are three &s;euerall Schooles or Hals, where the three mo&s;t famous and worthy artes <HI>Diuinity, Law</HI> and <HI>Phy&s;icke</HI> are read by their &s;euerall and proper Lecturers, be&s;ide the other liberall Sciences which together with them are there taught and expounded vnto the yonger &s;ort of &s;tudents. To this is adioined a Free Schoole for Grammar &s;cholars, with &s;undry other court yards, and hals or dining roomes.</P>
<P>The PALACE is &s;o &s;ituate, that from thence you may ea&s;ily goe vnto the Church, the Colledge and mona&s;tery. It were a long di&s;cour&s;e particularly to de&s;cribe the &s;euerall lodgings of the King, the Amba&s;&s;adours, Comptroulers, Chamberlaines, Noblemens, Pen&s;ioners, Yeomen of the guard and other Officers belonging to the Court. The Kings Gallery openeth toward the North &s;ide of the Church, vpon who&s;e wall is painted the battell at Higueruela, in which King Iohn the Second ouercame the Moores of Grana|do. Which picture doth &s;o liuelily expre&s;&s;e the whole &s;tory and euery thing in it as it was done, as it is wonderfull. It &s;heweth in what order, and how the maine battell was &s;et, where the Hor&s;emen, the Footmen, the Pikemen, the Targeters, the Archers, which then were in great reque&s;t, did &s;tand, and how and where they &s;euerally charged the enemy. This piece of worke was made at the commandement of Philip the &s;econd, king of Spaine, by an old patterne drawen in a piece of linnen cloth of an hundred and thirtie foot long, found in the old Towre of Segouia, which was fir&s;t drawen at that time that this battell was fought. Moreouer vpon the Ea&s;t and South &s;ides of this building there is a mo&s;t goodly and plea&s;ant Garden, which is an hundred foot broad, and is &s;et out and beautified with diuer&s;e knots, rare hearbs, floures and fountaines. To this garden is adioined an Orchard planted and &s;et with all ma|ner of trees. Within the precincts of this mona&s;tery there are more then forty fountaines. Such is the wonderfull number of Keies and Lockes about this hou&s;e, which do amount vnto certaine thou&s;ands, that there is a &s;eueral and proper Officer for to looke to them onely, called, The ma&s;ter of the Keies. The forme of the mona&s;tery is foure-&s;quare, and euery &s;ide is two hundred and twenty foure pa&s;es long; only that &s;ide except that is next to the Pallace, which of purpo&s;e was made &s;horter then the other three, that the compa&s;&s;e or externall forme of the Abbey might repre&s;ent the fa&s;hion of the &s;quare of a gridiron, for that S. Laurence, to whom this hou&s;e was dedicated, was broiled to death vpon a gridiron. The Monkes which are in number three hundred, and as I haue &s;he|wed before, of the order of S. Hierome, do inhabite not pa&s;t the third part of this whole building. Their yearly reuenews do amount to 35000. Duckets. The other part of the reuenewes they doe be&s;tow vpon the king and his family. That I may conclude, it is fur|ni&s;hed with &s;o many Hals, Parlours, Chambers and other clo&s;ets and roomes for nece&s;&s;ary v&s;es in an hou&s;e, that there is roome inough to entertaine and lodge fowre Kings and their Courts at once, to that it may worthily challenge the fir&s;t place among&s;t the greate&s;t miracles of the whole world.</P>

<P>_GIraldus Cambren&s;is, a good Writer, that liued in the time of Henry the Second, &amp; wrote aboue 400 yeeres &s;ince, de&s;cribeth IRELAND on this maner: HIBERNIA, &s;aith he, <HI>po&s;t Britan|niam, in&s;ularum maxima, vnius contractioris diei nauigatione vltra Britannicas VVallias, in occidentali Oce|ano &s;ita e&s;t. Intra tamen Vltoniam &amp; Scoticas Galwedias duplo fer&egrave; angu&s;tiore &s;pacio mare coarctatur. Vtra&abque; ver&ograve; vtriu&s;que terrae promontoria, hinc di&s;tinctius, illinc ratione di&s;tantiae confu&s;ius, &s;atis apert&egrave; &s;ereno tempore per&s;pici po&s;&s;unt &amp; notari. In&s;ularum occidentalium haec vltima. Hi&s;paniam, ab Au&s;tro, trium dierum naturali|um nauigatione, collateralem habet: Britanniam Maiorem, ab Oriente: Solum Oceanum, ab Occidente: Ab Aqui|lonari ver&ograve; parte, trium dierum velifico cur&s;u, borealium in&s;ularum maxima I&s;landia iacet.</HI> That is: IRE|LAND, the greate&s;t iland of the world but Britaine, lieth in the maine &s;ea, di&s;tant We&s;tward from Wales about a dayes &s;aile: but betweene Vl&s;ter and Gallaway, a prouince of Scotland, the Sea is not much more than halfe &s;o farre ouer. The promontories, capes, or forlands (as you plea&s;e to call them) of both the&s;e countries, may very ea&s;ily, in a bright &s;unne-&s;hinie day, from hence be &s;eene and de&s;cried: yet the&s;e more plainer, tho&s;e, by rea&s;on they are farther off, more ob&s;curely. Of all the ilands of Europe this lieth farthe&s;t into the We&s;t. Vpon the South &s;ide it hath Spaine, di&s;tant from it about three dayes and three nights &s;aile. Vpon the Ea&s;t lieth Great Britaine. On the We&s;t &s;ide of it is nothing but the va&s;t Ocean &s;ea. Vpon the North, three daies iourney off, lieth I&s;land, which of all the Northren iles is by farre the greate&s;t. Againe, a little beneath he addeth: <HI>Hibernia quant&ograve; &agrave; caetero &amp; communi Orbe terrarum &s;emota, &amp; qua&s;i</HI> ALTER ORBIS <HI>e&s;&s;e digno&s;citur: tant&ograve; rebus quibu&s;dam, &s;olito naturae cur&s;u, incognitis, qua&s;i peculiaris eiu&s;dem</HI> NATV|RAE THESAVRVS, <HI>vbi in&s;ignia &amp; pretio&s;iora &s;ui &s;ecreta repo&s;uerit, e&s;&s;e videtur.</HI> Looke by how much Ireland is di&s;ioy|ned from the re&s;t of the knowen world, and in that re&s;pect is commonly holden to be as it were ANOTHER WORLD: &s;o, for certeine things, by the common cour&s;e of Nature, to others vnknowen, it &s;eemeth to be a &s;pe|ciall and peculiar Trea&s;urie or STOREHOVSE OF NATVRE, where it hath be&s;towed and layed vp her mo&s;t excellent and rare&s;t &s;ecrets. Oro&s;ius (and I&s;idore from him) reporteth, That Ireland is much le&s;&s;e than England, but by rea&s;on of the &s;ituation, and temperature of the aire here, it is generally more fertile than England. Yea and reue|rend Beda, our country man, he &s;ayth, That the aire in Ireland is more healthfull and cleare than it is in England. <HI>(Hi|berniam tum a&euml;ris &s;alubritate, qu&agrave;m &s;erenitate multum Britanniae prae&s;tare.)</HI> Yet Giraldus denieth the latter. For (&s;ayth he) as France for thinne&s;&s;e and clearne&s;&s;e of the aire doth far excell England, &s;o England for the &s;ame doth as far excell Ire|land. For, this is certaine, the farther you go Ea&s;tward, looke by how much the aire is more &s;ubtile, pure and thinne, &s;o much is it more fierce, &s;harpe and piercing. On the contrary, the farther you go toward the South and We&s;t parts of the world, by how much the aire is more thicke, cloudy and foggy, by &s;o much it is more temperate, kinde and healthfull. For this countrey, lying in the mid&s;t indifferently &s;eated betweene frozen I&s;land, and parched Spaine, and by that meanes getting a meane temperature betweene hot and cold, a&s;well in re&s;pect of that temperature and hole|&s;omne&s;&s;e of the aire, is a mo&s;t goodly &amp; fertile iland. The champion fields do yeeld great &s;tore of corne; the moun|taines do feed many heards of cattell, the woods affoord many Deere and other kind of wild bea&s;ts, the lakes and ri|uers great variety and plenty of good fi&s;h. Yet the &s;oile of this iland is better for Pa&s;torage than Arable-ground; for Gra&s;&s;e than Corne. <HI>Multam fruges in Hibernia,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>plurimam in culmis, minorem in granis &s;pem promittunt. Abund&egrave; &s;atis &amp; campi ve&s;tiuntur, &amp; horrea farciuntur, &s;ola ver&ograve; granaria de&s;tituuntur.</HI> Here their corne, as long as it is in the gra&s;&s;e (for <HI>Hiber|nia</HI> I read <HI>herba</HI>) is maruellous good, but much better it &s;eemeth to be when it is &s;hot vp and &s;pindled, only it faileth when it commeth to the thre&s;hing, then it is &s;eldome found to be ca&s;ty. In the field it maketh a goodly &s;hew, yea ordinarily it is as thicke as may &s;tand vpon the ground, their barnes are crammed full and mowed vp to the top, only their garners are empty. Thus farre Giraldus: and becau&s;e we haue handled the generall de&s;cription of this iland in another place of this our worke, we will conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with a briefe de&s;cription of &s;ome few of their cities and principall townes, as we haue learned of that worthy gentleman Richard Stanihur&s;t, this countreyman bredde and borne. DVBLIN, &s;ituate vpon the riuer Liffe, in the countie of Dublin, the Metropolitan and chiefe citie not only of Leyn&s;ter, but al&s;o of all Ireland, for goodly faire buildings, multitude of people, ciuility, for &s;weet aire and &s;i|tuation, doth as farre excell all the other cities of this ile, as the lofty cypre&s;&s;e doth the lowe&s;t &s;hrubs. The <HI>Cathedrall church</HI> of S. Patricks was fir&s;t founded by Iohn Cinim Archbi&s;hop of Dublin, in the yere of our Lord God 1197. That great and goodly &s;trong <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> was built by Henry Loundres Archbi&s;hop al&s;o of Dublin, about the yere of our Lord 1220. This city is very ancient, and was in Ptolemeys time (as learned men thinke) called <HI>Ciuitas Eblana,</HI> The city Eb|lan. The next city in order and dignity is WATERFORD, a well gouerned towne, and one that hath been alwaies faithfull to England. It is very populous and ciuill, and (for that the hauen here is far better and more &s;afe than that of Dublin) much re&s;orted vnto for trade and trafficke, by merchants of forren countreys. The &s;treets of it are very narrow and darke. Here no cutthroat-Iewi&s;h v&s;urer is permitted to v&s;e his diuelli&s;h occupation, that is, as Cato &s;ayd, to kill men, or to liue by the &s;weat of other mens browes. The third is LIMMERICK, which in regard of the good|ly riuer Shenyn whereupon it is &s;eated and &s;tandeth, as al&s;o for the commodious &s;ituation of the &s;ame, might iu&s;tly challenge the fir&s;t place. For this riuer is the greate&s;t and goodlie&s;t of all Ireland, who&s;e depth and channell is &s;uch, that notwith&s;tanding the city &s;tandeth at the lea&s;t three&s;core miles from the maine &s;ea, yet &s;hips of great burden doe come vp euen to the towne walles: be&s;ides that it is woonderfully &s;tored with great variety of fre&s;h fi&s;h. King Iohn did like the &s;ituation of this city &s;o well, that he cau&s;ed there a goodly ca&s;tle and faire bridge to be built. The la&s;t and lea&s;t is CORCK, &s;ituate vpon the riuer Leigh. This hauen is one of the be&s;t in all Ireland, and therefore the citizens are very wealthy and great merchants. The&s;e three latter are all within the prouince of Moun&s;ter. But if thou de&s;i|re&s;t a larger di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e particulars, I wi&s;h thee to repaire to the fore&s;ayd authour Richard Stanihur&s;t, he &s;hall &s;atisfie thee to the full.</P>

<P>^e The fir&s;t inhabitants which &s;eated them&s;elues heere pre&s;ently after the vniuer&s;all floud in the dayes of Noe, came hither from France, as Necrene&s;&s;e of place, Likene&s;&s;e of maners, Gouernment, Cu&s;tomes, Name and Language, doe very demon&s;tratiuely prooue and euince. And thereupon they call them&s;elues <HI>Cumro,</HI> as come from <HI>Gomer</HI> the &s;onne of Iapheth (called of Hi&s;toriographers <HI>Cimber</HI>) from whom are de&s;cended the <HI>Celiae</HI> or ancient Gauls, the inhabitants not only of France, but generally of all the Northwe&s;t parts of Europe. What thinke you then of that &s;tory of Brute? Mary I thinke he wanted hone&s;ty that fir&s;t inuented that fable, and he wit that beleeueth it. But Iohn Wheatham&s;ted, &s;ome|time Abbat of S. Albans, a graue learned man and of good iudgement, &s;hall &s;peake for me; <HI>Totus i&s;te proce&s;&s;us,</HI> &s;aith he, <HI>de Bruto, po&euml;ticus e&s;t potius qu&agrave;m hi&s;toricus, opinatiuu&s;&abque; magis propter varias cau&s;as, qu&agrave;m realis:</HI> That whole di&s;cour&s;e of Brute, is rather to be accounted as a fable and fiction forged in poets braine, then a true hi&s;tory, done and acted indeed. Item William of Newbury, a writer of good credit, and one that liued at the &s;ame time with this Geffrey of Munmouth, did accu&s;e him to his face of forgery, and challenged him for the &s;ame. For fir&s;t, for the name of Bri|tons they neuer knew what it meant vntill the entrance of the Romans, and was then as har&s;h vnto the&s;e <HI>Cumbri,</HI> as the name of <HI>Welchman,</HI> is to them at this day; which it is certeine diuers of the vpland people do not acknowledge nor vnder&s;tand what it &s;hould meane. Againe, Ludouicus Vines, Hadrianus Iunius, Buchanan, Polydore Virgil, Bodine and other great men, do all iointly confe&s;&s;e that there was neuer in the world any &s;uch man as this Brutus. Moreouer, That pre&s;ently after the confu&s;ion at Babell, in the infancy of the world, when the iles of the Gentiles were diuided into their lands, as the Scripture &s;peaketh, euery man after his tongue, after their families in their nations, that is, That &s;uch men as by rea|&s;on of difference and diuer&s;ity of language, did &s;eparate them&s;elues from &s;uch as they vnder&s;tood not, and therefore could not conuer&s;e withall, into their &s;euerall companies and hords, did beare the name and denomination of their father and prince of that family, it is very plaine and mani|fe&s;t: but that any nation was named or called after the name of the chiefe leader and conductour of a colony, I yet find not auouched by any good authour. It is mo&s;t certaine and without all controuer&s;ie true, That diuers countries haue beene called by &s;undry names, by forreners and &s;tran|gers, neuer knowen nor acknowledged of the nations them&s;elues. Do you thinke that the ancient inhabitants of Spaine did euer know what <HI>He|&s;peria</HI> meant? None &s;urely euer called that countrey by this name, but the Graecians only. <HI>Albion</HI> and <HI>Britannia</HI> doubtle&s;&s;e were names as barba|rous vnto the&s;e our <HI>Cumbri,</HI> and neuer heard of before the entrance of the Romans. There is no Colony, although neuer &s;o &s;mall and few, but will reteine much of their owne countrey language, either wholly vncorrupt, or els manife&s;tly to be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the phra&s;e and proprietie of &s;peech. Tho&s;e few Flemmings who (their countrey being by the breaking in of the &s;ea ouerflowen and drowned) obteined of King Henrie the fir&s;t, a part of Penbrooke &s;hire in Wales which the Welchmen call Ro&s;&s;e, lying betweene two riuers, not farre off from Milford hauen, are they not to this day di&s;tingui&s;hed, from their neighbours round about them by their &s;peech and language? And becau&s;e their &s;peech doth much re|&s;emble the Engli&s;h, is not their countrey commonly called, of tho&s;e which inhabit neere vnto them, <HI>Little England beyond Wales?</HI> The like you &s;hall ob&s;erue by the Briti&s;h colony, which aboue eleuen hundred yeeres &s;ince tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that part of France, which of them euer &s;ince hath beene knowen by the name of Britaine: Of the colony of the Scots in Ireland, and of the Iri&s;h in Scotland. If any man will &s;ay that there is the like re&s;emblance betweene the Welch tongue and the Greeke or Latine, I will iu&s;tifie it that there is as great affinitie betweene the Welch and Arabicke, and againe that the&s;e are as like the one to other as an apple is to an oi&s;ter. Moreouer, this entrance of Brute was an ab&s;olute con|que&s;t, the giants (if there were euer any &s;uch) being vtterly de&s;troyed or quite chaced out of the land, and therefore there is no rea&s;on to the con|trary but they &s;hould haue, for the &s;pace of &s;euen hundred yeeres, kept their language from corruption, as well as they haue done &s;ince, being &s;ince the entrance of the Romans &s;ixteene hundred yeeres and more. The Latines or Greeks &s;o prodigall alwayes in their owne commendation, would doubtle&s;&s;e not haue forgotten to record the &s;etting forth of &s;uch a famous colony. Could this affinity haue beene hid from Cae&s;ar? would they not, thinke you, haue claimed kindred of the Romans? Con&s;tans and Con&s;tantius Emperours of Rome were the fir&s;t, by the te&s;timony of Iu|lius Firmicus, that euer dur&s;t venture thorow the&s;e &s;eas. How then did this Brutus, &s;o many hundred yeeres before, in &s;uch &s;mall barks, &s;o &s;lightly built, pa&s;&s;e the &s;ame? Aeneas, they report, of his many &s;hips lo&s;t all but one before he could get home, in the Midland &s;ea, which is nothing &s;o dangerous and trouble&s;ome. Can it be thought credible that &s;uch a warlike nation as the&s;e Troians, hauing &s;o lately got footing and &s;eated them|&s;elues in &s;o goodly a countrey as Italy, would &s;o &s;uddenly remoue &s;o farre off, to a place vnknowen? The Romans hauing &s;uch dangerous warres, and &s;uch occa&s;ion to v&s;e men and braue commanders, would neuer haue &s;uffered them in &s;uch troopes to pa&s;&s;e out of their countrey. If it had tooke the name of Brutus, it &s;hould doubtle&s;&s;e haue been called Brutania, not Britannia, as Cae&s;ar nameth it, nor Bretania, Pretanice, or Pretanis, as the Greeks do write it. But li&s;t what Cae&s;ar &s;ayth of this matter, <HI>Britania pars interior,</HI> &s;ayth he, <HI>ab ijs incolitur, quos natos in in&s;ula ip&s;i memoria pro|ditum dicunt. Maritima pars ab ijs, qui praedae ac belli inferendi cau&s;a ex Belgio tran&s;ierant.</HI> The inner part of the ile is inhabited of &s;uch people as were bred and borne there, as they them&s;elues do report from their ance&s;tours. The &s;ea coa&s;t is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch as haue come thither from Flanders and thereabout, to robbe and &s;poile the countrey. If this were all that was then knowen, and that Gildas Sapiens and Venerabilis Beda knew no|thing to the contrary, how came this our authour, &s;o many hundred yeeres after them, to the knowledge of this &s;o ab&s;olute an hi&s;tory, where not only per&s;ons, places, and actions are &s;o di&s;tinctly &s;et downe with their preci&s;e difference of time, as if they had beene done but ye&s;terday? The hi&s;torian, for things done in his owne time, or not long before, is beleeued vpon his owne word, but for &s;uch things as were done many ages be|fore he was borne, he mu&s;t bring his author to iu&s;tifie his a&s;&s;ertion. If there had beene any &s;uch tradition commonly deliuered from man to man, it would que&s;tionle&s;&s;e haue beene intimated to Cae&s;ar. Records can not be pre&s;erued but by writing; and that knowledge came in with the Ro|mans. But if it be a que&s;tion whether there were euer any &s;uch city as that Troy, &s;o much renowmed by meanes of that learned po&euml;me of the fa|mous Po&euml;t Homer, what will become of the &s;tories of Aeneas (which, if I mi&s;take him not, the great Hi&s;toriographer Titus Liuius doth make a doubt of) and of this our Brutus neuer patronaged by any great learned wi&s;e man? I know that is improued by &s;ome, and I thinke it may be de|mon&s;trated. For further &s;atisfaction I referre thee to M. Camdens Britannia, where this argument is handled at large and mo&s;t learnedly. Only in defence of Gaulfridus, le&s;t any man &s;hould thinke that I haue all this while &s;poken again&s;t his per&s;on, I conclude with this &s;ayng of a learned man of our time; <HI>Cardanus ait,</HI> &s;ayth he, <HI>illius aetatis &s;criptores tantopere mendacio &amp; fabulis fui&s;&s;e delectatos, vt in contentionem venerint quis plura con|fingeret.</HI> Cardane &s;ayth, That the Hi&s;torians and Writers of tho&s;e times (betweene foure hundred and fiue hundred yeeres &s;ince) were &s;o much delighted with fables and lies, that they &s;troue who &s;hould lie fa&s;te&s;t, and win the whet&s;tone. It was, you &s;ee, the fault of the time and age where|in he liued, not of the man. The learned Oratour Tully, in the &s;econd booke of his Offices, as I remember, thus de&s;cribeth the vertues of a true
<PB REF="332"> Hi&s;toriographer: <HI>Ne quid fal&s;i &s;cribere audeat; Ne quid veri non audeat; Ne quam in &s;cribendo &s;u&s;pitionem gratiae; Ne quam &s;imultatis o&s;tendat.</HI> A good Hi&s;torian may not dare to write any thing that is fal&s;e; He may not be afrayd to write any thing that is true; He mu&s;t not &s;hew any partiality or fauour in writing; He ought to be void of all affection and malice. Learned Antiquaries follow this good coun&s;ell of the graue Philo&s;opher; Sell vs no more dro&s;&s;e for pure mettall; Refine what you reade and write; Euery tale is not true that is tolde: Some authours want iudgement; others hone&s;ty: Let no man be beleeued for his antiquity: For you know what Menander &s;ayd, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">; Grayhaires are not alwayes a &s;igne of wi&s;dome and deepe vnder&s;tanding; olde men do &s;ometime dote, and will lie as well as others.

And how hard a matter it is to remoue one from a &s;etled opinion, though neuer &s;o fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, any man meanly experienced doth very well know.</P>
<P>^f Yet Cae&s;ar &s;aith that <HI>Britanniae Loca &s;unt temperatiora, q&ugrave;am in Gallia, remi&s;&s;ioribus frigoribus:</HI> The temperature of the aire in England, is better then in France, the cold is nothing &s;o bitter. That is, as the authour of the Panegyricke oration made to Con&s;tantius the Emperour doth inter|pret it, <HI>In ea nec rigor e&s;t nimius hyemis, nec ardor ae&s;tatis:</HI> In it neither the cold of winter, nor the heat of &s;ummer is very exce&s;&s;iue. And Minutius Felix hee writeth that, <HI>Britannia &s;ole deficitur, &s;ed circumfluentis maris tepore recreatur.</HI> In England the Sunne &s;hineth not very hotte, but that de|fect is repaied by a certaine &s;teame or hot vapour which a&s;cendeth vp out of the &s;ea that inuironeth this iland on all &s;ides round.</P>
<P>^g What place this &s;hould be, I dare not for truth con&s;tantly affirme, Perhaps he meaneth <HI>Vit&s;am,</HI> or as we call it <HI>Whit&s;an,</HI> a little towne in the country of Bolloine &s;ome fiue or &s;ix miles from Calais, &s;ituate vpon the &s;ea coa&s;t, built at the mouth of a &s;mall riuer, which peraduenture he cal|leth <HI>Shant:</HI> For in the Arabicke tongue <HI>Wadi-&s;hant,</HI> importeth &s;o much.</P>
<P>^h This is fal&s;e and by him&s;elfe contradicted: for in another place, if I be not deceiued, he maketh it twenty fiue miles ouer: wherefore I doubt not but for a mile the authour did put a para&s;ange, which conteineth three Engli&s;h miles: And this is &s;omewhat neere the mark.</P>
<P>^i I take it that he meaneth <HI>Cerce&s;ter,</HI> in Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, which vulgarly they now call <HI>Ciceter.</HI> It is an ancient city called of Ptolemey <HI>Corinium,</HI> of Antonine <HI>Durocornouium,</HI> of the Saxons <HI>Cyrencea&s;ter,</HI> taking the denomination from the riuer <HI>Corinus,</HI> or <HI>Churne,</HI> vpon which it is &s;ituate. The tract of the decaied wals of it which are two miles about, doe te&s;tifie that it was &s;ometime a very great citie. Many antiquities and auncient mo|numents doe plainly &s;hew that in the time of the Romans it was a place of good rekoning. Now it is nothing &s;o populous and well inhabited.</P>
<P>^k From the Seuerne, I vnder&s;tand it, which at euery floude enterteineth the &s;alt water a great way vp into the countrey.</P>
<P>^l <HI>Warham,</HI> is a &s;ea towne in Dor&s;et&s;hire, &s;trongly fortified by nature, vpon the South and North with two riuers, Ware, and Trent (this now they call Piddle) and with the maine &s;ea, vpon the Ea&s;t, only vpon the Wew it lieth open to the a&s;&s;ailaunt. Yet it was in times pa&s;t defended with a faire wall, and a &s;trong Ca&s;tle. It was very populous, well inhabited, and graced with the Kings mint, for the refining and coining of his mo|ny, vntill the time of Henry the Second: &s;ince who&s;e daies by rea&s;on of ciuill warres, ca&s;ualty by fire, and &s;topping of the hauen, it is much decaied, and hath lo&s;t much of that former beauty.</P>
<P>^m This di&s;tance is much too great, whether he meaneth the lands end in Cornwall, or the farther part of Wales We&s;tward, which I rather in|cline to. But ob&s;erue this once for all, that there is no great heed to be taken to tho&s;e his accounts of miles and di&s;tances.</P>
<P>^n <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> an hauen towne in Deuon&s;hire, &s;ituate vpon a little hill running out into the &s;ea, at the mouth of the riuer <HI>Dart</HI> or <HI>Dert,</HI> as &s;ome write it. The hauen is defended with two &s;trong Ca&s;tels or Block-hou&s;es. It is very populous, well frequented with Merchants, and hath many goodly tall &s;hippes belonging to it. King Iohn granted them certaine priuiledges and euery yeere to chu&s;e a Maior for their &s;upreme magi&s;trrate and gouernour in ciuill cau&s;es vnder the King.</P>
<P>^o Thus our &s;eamen cal it at this day: The Arabian termeth it <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Tarfi'lgarbi mina'lgiezira,</HI> The We&s;terne bound of the iland. Ma&s;ter Camden, in his Scotland, that I may note this by the way, affirmeth that <HI>Taurus,</HI> in Welch, doth &s;ignifie the end or limbe of any thing. Heere in Arabicke, thou &s;ee&s;t, it &s;ignifieth the &s;ame. And in Engli&s;h wee call, if I be not deceiued, the brimmes of an hatte, The tarfe.</P>
<P>^p SALISBVRY or rather SARISBVRY a &s;weet and plea&s;ant city, within the County of Wilt, &s;ituate in a plaine at the meeting of the riuers Auone and Nadder. It is not that ancient city <HI>Sorbiodunum,</HI> mentioned by Antoninus in his Iournall, but built of the ruines of it, as &s;eemeth very probable. For this old towne being often di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for want of water, and at length &s;poiled and ra&s;ed to the ground, by Swein the Dane, in the yeare of our Lord 1003. (although it reuiued againe a little after, about the time of William the Fir&s;t) was for&s;aken and abandoned by the citi|zens, who laid the foundation of this new citie about 400. yeares &s;ince, at what time Richard the Fir&s;t was King of England. That mo&s;t &s;tately Cathedrall Church, which they report hath as many doores as there be months in the yeare; as many windowes as the yeare hath daies; and as many pillars as there are houres in the yeare; was at the &s;ame time begunne by Richard, Bi&s;hop of Sarum, in a mo&s;t goodly plot of ground, which vulgarly was called MERIFEILD, and in fourty yeares with infinite co&s;t and charges, it was by him and others fini&s;hed and brought to that per|fection which it is at now at this day.</P>
<P>^q SOVTH-HANTON (we now call it,) built vpon an arme of the &s;ea betweene two riuers, is enclo&s;ed with a double ditch and a faire &s;tone wall. For the better defence of the Hauen Richard the Second cau&s;ed a very goodly ca&s;tle to be built all of free &s;tone. It is a pa&s;&s;ing fine city, ve|ry populous, rich, and well frequented of Merchants. <HI>Clau&s;entum,</HI> that ancient city mentioned by Antoninus, and &s;tood &s;ometimes in that field which at this day is called Saint Maries, was often &s;poiled and &s;acked by the Danes, and at length, in the time of Edward the Third was vtterly con&s;umed and burnt downe to the ground by the French-men: Of who&s;e ruines this New city was built in a place much more better and com|modious.</P>
<P>^r This riuer, peraduenture, was anciently called WENT, and thereof the citie <HI>Wentche&s;ter,</HI> happily tooke the name: like as the cite <HI>Colnche|&s;ter</HI> in E&s;&s;ex, was &s;o called of the riuer Colne, vpon Which it &s;tandeth.</P>
<P>^&s; WINCHESTER, A very auncient citie, well knowen to the Romanes, and is oft mentioned in old hi&s;torians. Afterward in time &s;o the Saxon Heptarchie, the We&s;t Saxon Kings ordinarily kept their court heere. Straite after the entrance of the Normans, and peraduenture &s;ome|what before, the Records for the whole land were here be&s;towed and laied vp. It was once or twi&s;e much defaced by ca&s;ualty of fire, and oft &s;poi|led and &s;acked by vnruly &s;ouldiers in time of ciuill warres: but Edward the Third, to &s;alue the&s;e damages and hinderances of the citizens and towne&s;men, placed heere THE STAPLE, or marte for wooll and cloth. At this time it is very populous and well inhabited. The wals of this citie are about a mile and an halfe in compa&s;&s;e. It hath &s;ix faire gates, and very large Suburbes adioyning to euery one of them.</P>
<P>^t SHORHAM, an ancient Borough and hauen towne in Su&s;&s;ex, fir&s;t called, as Ma&s;ter Camden writeth, CIMENSHORE of <HI>Cimen,</HI> the bro|ther of <HI>Ci&s;&s;a,</HI> who together with <HI>Aella</HI> their father, landed a greater multitude of their Saxons. But in continuance of time a greate part of that towne being eaten vp with the &s;ea, and the mouth of the hauen with beech and &s;and det vp, of a goodly towne it is become a &s;mall village, at this day knowen by the name of OLD SHOREHAM, the decay of which gaue occa&s;ion of the building and name of another not farre off from it, commonly called NEVV SHOREHAM.</P>
<P>^u Heere Athel&s;tane King of the We&s;t-Saxons, who made a lawe that no man &s;hould be &s;o hardy as to dare to coine money out of great townes priuiledged by the King for that purpu&s;e, erected a Minte for the coyning of his Siluer and other mettals, by which means it became &s;o famous that in the time of the Saxons it de&s;erued the name of a city and was then called by them HASTINGACEASTER. In a plaine, before this towne, that bloody battaill betweene William, the ba&s;tard, Duke of Normandy, that cruell tyrant, and Harold the v&s;urper, &s;onne of Earle Good|win, was fought vpon the fourteenth day of October, in the yeare of our Lord 1066. It is one of the cinque ports.</P>
<P>^w DOVER, before the entrance of the Saxons was called <HI>Dubris,</HI> as Antoninus in his Iournal te&s;tifieth, who nameth it <HI>Portus Dubris,</HI> The ha|ven Dubris. Vpon that &s;ide next the &s;ea that was &s;ometime defended with a &s;trong wall, whereof &s;ome part is to be &s;eene at this daie. Victred King of Kent did heere erect a goodly Church, which hee dedicated vnto Saint Martines. The ca&s;tle which &s;tandeth vpon the toppe of an exce|ding high cliffe, and is thought to be the &s;tronge&s;t holde of all England, and therefore called by Matthew Paris <HI>Clauis &amp; repagulum Angliae,</HI> The key and barre of England, was begunne, as is probable, by the Romans; yet not by Iulius Cae&s;ar, as they would faine make men beleeue. Vpon another rocke or cliffe, ouer again&s;t this on the other &s;ide of the towne, there was, as &s;eemeth, a lanterne or watch-tower (<HI>Pharus,</HI> they call it) oppo&s;ite and an&s;werable to that which the Romans had built at Bollein, beyond the &s;traights in Fraunce, which afterward being decaied was re|paired by Charles the Great, and at this day is called by the French, <HI>Tour d'order,</HI> by the Engli&s;h, THE OLD MAN OF BVLLEN.</P>
<P>^x This is that famous pa&s;&s;age <HI>(traiectus,)</HI> from the Continent vnto this Iland, by which Cae&s;ar and the Romans alwaies entred and had acce&s;&s;e hither: For vntill the time of Con&s;tans and Con&s;tantine Emperours of Rome, it was thought almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to come hither from Rome, with a nauy thorough the maine Ocean: And &s;ince that long, it was, in time of Chri&s;tianity, by proclamation forbidden, that, what&s;oeuer hee were, borne within the alleageance of England, that had a minde to goe beyond the &s;eas for religion or pilgrimage, it &s;hould not be lawfull for him to take &s;hipping any where el&s;e but heere. The Frenchmen vulgarly call it <HI>Le pas de Calais,</HI> but the Engli&s;h call it <HI>The &s;treights of Douer.</HI></P>
<P>^y <HI>London,</HI> (we now call it) but of the French and Strangers it is commonly called <HI>Londres</HI> or <HI>Londra.</HI> Yet Tacitus, Ptolemey, Antonine, and Ammianus Marcellinus doe with one con&s;ent write it LONDINVM or LONGIDINVM, &s;o named of the Britons, as is probable, of <HI>Llong,</HI>
<PB REF="333"> Ships, and <HI>Dinas,</HI> a Citie: an&s;werable to tho&s;e places of Graecia <HI>Naupactus, Naupactus, Nau&s;tathino,</HI> &amp;c. denominated of Ships. It is doubtle&s;&s;e a very anci|ent citie, as Ammianus Marcellinus te&s;tifieth, who twelue hundred yeares &s;ince called it <HI>Vetu&s;tum oppidum,</HI> An ancient towne. Yet Iulius Cae&s;ar neuer mentioneth it in all his writings. Cornelius Tacitus, who liued in the daies of Nero, that bloody Emperour, was the fir&s;t, if I be not decei|ued, that euer wrot of it, calling it by the name of <HI>Oppidum, copia negotiatorum, &amp; commeatu maxime celebre,</HI> A Towne very famous both for traf|ficke and great concour&s;e of Marchants, as al&s;o for victualls and all manner ot proui&s;ion what&s;oeuer. Nay he that made the Panegyricke oration to Con&s;tantius the Emperour, and Marcellinus who liued after him, giue it no better title. Yet at this day it is An abridgement or breefe view of the whol iland, The Imperiall &s;eate of the Britti&s;h iles, <HI>Regum&abque; Angliae camera,</HI> and The chamber of the Engli&s;h Kings: and therefore it may now iu&s;tly a&s;&s;ume that title of AVGVSTA, The roiall city, which Ammianus &s;o many hundred yeeres &s;ince gaue vnto it. And being &s;ituate vp|on the ri&s;ing of a little hill, in a mo&s;t whol&s;ome and healthfull aire, in the midde&s;t of the riche&s;t countries of the land, all a long vpon the North &s;ide of the Thames, one of the goodlie&s;t riuers of Europe, it is at this day as famous a Marte, for all manner of trade and trafficke as any in the whole world be&s;ide. The wals of this citie, which are about three miles in compa&s;&s;e, are not ancient, although &s;ome doe write, that at the entrea|tie of Queene Helena, Con&s;tantine the Great cau&s;ed them to be built. Be&s;ide tho&s;e many and large Suburbes without the wals, there is ioined to it, vpon the We&s;t the citie of WESTMINSTER, and vpon the South by a faire &s;tone bridge the BOROVGH OF SOVTHVVARKE, equall for bigne&s;&s;e and multitude of people to many great and good cities: So that London in this re&s;pect may iu&s;tly be called <HI>Tripolid' Angliterra.</HI> This <HI>Bridge</HI> was begunne fir&s;t of timber, and afterward in the time of King Iohn it was made all of Free-&s;tone. The foundation of that goodly Myn&s;ter or Cathedrall Church of Saint Paul was fir&s;t laid by Ethelbert King of Kent.</P>
<P>^z <HI>Yarmouth,</HI> as we now call it, a very goodly &s;ea towne in the county of Norffolke, &s;ituate at the mouth of the riuer Gerne <HI>(Garienis,)</HI> whereof it tooke the name, and was fir&s;t called <HI>Giernemouth,</HI> and then by corruption in proce&s;&s;e of time <HI>Garmouth,</HI> and <HI>Yarmoth.</HI> It is inclo&s;ed almo&s;t on all &s;ides with water, vpon the We&s;t with the riuer afore&s;aid: vpon the South and Ea&s;t with the maine &s;ea: only vpon the North it lieth open to the firme land, vpon which &s;ide it is defended from the a&s;&s;ault of the enemy by a very &s;trong wall, which together with the riuer doe make a kinde of Square figure longer one way then an other. On the Ea&s;t &s;ide &s;tandeth a Block-hou&s;e, well furni&s;hed with great ordinance to defend the ha|uen and towne from pirates and &s;ea robbers. It hath but one Church, but that is a marueillous faire great one with a very high Spire, &s;eene far off both by &s;ea and land.</P>
<P>^a What this towne &s;hould be, and where it &s;hould &s;tand I cannot &s;ay for certaine. The letters in the Arabicke, and the proportion of di&s;tance from Yarmouth and Grynsby, doe directly point at Drayton in Northhampton-&s;hire. But becau&s;e it is too far off from the &s;ea, and was neuer greater then now it is, and for that I finde him &s;o often faulty in tho&s;e accounts, I doe not beleeue that he meant that place. The name commeth very neere to <HI>Tork&s;ey,</HI> which is &s;ituate vpon the Trent, and, as Ma&s;ter Camden &s;ath, although now it be but a &s;mall towne, yet in times pa&s;t it hath beene much greater and more famous. For in time of William the Fir&s;t, as appeareth by Doome&s;day booke, it had two hundred citizens, and enioyed many great and large priuileges.</P>
<P>^b <HI>Grim&s;by,</HI> in Lincoln&s;hire, &s;ometime a very great Marte towne, much re&s;orted vnto from all quarters both by Sea and Land, &s;o long as the ha|uen lay open ready to entertaine Ships of any rea&s;onable burden. But as the hauen did in continuance of time decay, &s;o the glory of the towne, by little and little vani&s;hed, and re&s;igned vp her trade vnto King&s;ton vpon Hull, her ouerthwarte neighbour, which euer &s;ince the time of Rich|ard the Second, hath greatly flouri&s;hed, in who&s;e daies of a &s;mall village and a very few poore Fi&s;her-mens cottages it began to grow to that great|ne&s;&s;e, that of a &s;udden it was not much inferiour to many prety cities.</P>
<P>^c <HI>Yorke,</HI> a very goodly citie, &s;ituate vpon the riuer Ou&s;e. For beauty, greatne&s;&s;e, &s;trength, riches and plea&s;ure it is inferiour to none in all Eng|land, but London only. Old writers call it EBORACVM, the Welchmen <HI>Ebrauc,</HI> or <HI>Effroc:</HI> the Saxons <HI>Eferwic:</HI> And therefore I &s;u&s;pect that this my authour did write it <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Efferwic,</HI> not <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Effradic:</HI> but I alter nothing. It is a very ancient citie oft mentioned in Roman Coines and hi&s;tories, whereby it is manife&s;t that <HI>Legio &s;exta victrix,</HI> the &s;ixth conquering legion, did ordinarily re&s;ide in this city. The Emperours Seuerus and Con&s;tantius, father to Con&s;tantine the Great, &s;o long as they abode in this ile, did keepe their court heere, and dying in the&s;e parts, were bu|ried, in this city. This Con&s;tantius being a very godly and religious Chri&s;tian Prince; made it fir&s;t as our hi&s;tories report, a Bi&s;hops &s;ea, which Ho|norius Bi&s;hop of Rome, afterward aduanced vnto the dignity of a Metropolitane, or Archbi&s;hopricke, which, be&s;ide the large iuri&s;diction that it had heere in England, had al&s;o vnder it all Scotland.</P>
<P>^d <HI>Wi&s;ke,</HI> it is called at this day. It ri&s;eth in Richmond-&s;hire not farre from Wharleton Ca&s;tle, as Chri&s;topher Saxto maketh me beleeue.</P>
<P>^e I finde no mention at all of this place, either in Ma&s;ter Camden, or any other. Onely in the &s;ame Saxton vpon the fore&s;aid riuer, &s;ome two or three miles aboue Northaluerton, I finde <HI>Danby Wiske:</HI> but whether our authour meant this or not I cannot tell. But I would gladly learne of what place the Lord of <HI>Ve&s;cy,</HI> tooke his name.</P>
<P>^f <HI>Lincolne,</HI> a large and faire city, &s;ituate now vpon the North &s;ide of the riuer Witham, called by Ptolemey and Antonine LINDVM, by Beda <HI>Lindecollinum,</HI> by the Normans, as Ma&s;ter Camden te&s;tifieth, <HI>Nichol.</HI></P>
<P>^g This is very fal&s;e: For this riuer hauing hitherto, from his fountaine, bent his cour&s;e Northward as if it meant indeed to vnload it &s;elfe at Grimesby, doth notwith&s;tanding heere alter that determination, and turning it &s;elfe cleane another way at length falleth into the &s;ea at Bo&s;ton; a place almo&s;t full South both from Lincolne and Grimesby.</P>
<P>^h <HI>Durham,</HI> &s;ituate vpon the top of an hill, by the riuer Weare, which runneth almo&s;t round about it, and thereupon was called by the Saxons <HI>Dun-holme,</HI> that is, if we &s;hall interpret it into Engli&s;h, The hill-ile, is no ancient city: For the fiir&s;t &s;tone of it, as our hi&s;tories report was laid by the Monkes of Lindesferne, in the yeere of our Lord 995. before that we find no mention of it. William the Fir&s;t built the Ca&s;tle vpon the top of the Hill, which &s;ince that time was the Bi&s;hops palace.</P>
<P>^i <HI>Ireland,</HI> the greate&s;t iland in the&s;e Seas, Brittain only excepted: for it runneth out in length from South to North about foure hundred miles: and where it is narrowe&s;t it is well neere two hundred miles ouer. But of this we haue &s;poken in another place.</P>
<P>^k <HI>Denmarke,</HI> (we now cal it) is for the mo&s;t part inuironed and wa&s;hed with the &s;alt &s;ea: and therefore he doth not greatly erre, in that he termeth it An Iland.</P>
<P>^l <HI>I&s;land</HI> (if I be not deceiued) which Solinus in the thirtie fiue chapter of his Polyhi&s;tor, &s;aith, is two daies &s;aile from Cathne&s;&s;e, the North cape of Scotland: His words are the&s;e, <HI>A Caledoniae promontorio Thulen petentibus bidui nauigatio e&s;t.</HI> Tho&s;e that doe trauell betweene the cape of Caledonia or Cathne&s;&s;e and Thule, doe make it two daies &s;aile. Item in the &s;ame chapter, a little beneath, he writeth that, <HI>Ab Orcadibus Thulem v&s;&abque; quin&abque; dierum &amp; noctium nauigatio e&s;t.</HI> From the Orkney iles, to Thule are fiue daies, and fiue nights &s;aile. Yet I&s;land is not that ancient Thule, as Ma&s;ter Camden, in his Britania, proueth at large. The po&s;ition and di&s;tances an&s;wer well to Thule, but the quantity or bigne&s;&s;e argueth that he meant I&s;land, which is much farther off either from the coa&s;t of Norway, or borders of Scotland, as we &s;hall by and by &s;hew more plainly.</P>
<P>^m So it is written apparently: But ob&s;erue heere, That of the Arabicke letters, diuer&s;e in forme and &s;hape of body, are the very &s;ame, and are onely di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another by pricks or points, placed either ouer their heads or vnderneath them. Heereupon it is that that Arabicke word which heere I call <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Zanbaga,</HI> (&s;uppo&s;ing only one letter to be mi&s;placed, which might be the fault of the printer) may indifferently be either <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Norbaga,</HI> or <HI>Norwega,</HI> as the Danes call it: or <GAP DESC="blank" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Neriga,</HI> or <HI>Nerigon,</HI> whereof Pliny &s;peaketh; which is all one in effect. For Pomponius Mela &s;aith that <HI>Thule Bergarum</HI> (thus the learned Clarencieux readeth, not <HI>Belgarum) litori appo&s;ita e&s;t:</HI> that is, Thule is vpon the coa&s;t of Norway, oueragain&s;t the citie Bergen. And it is out of all que&s;tion, &s;aith the &s;ame authour, that by Nerigon Pliny did vnder&s;tand that &s;ame country which at this day we call Norway.</P>
<P>^n That our authour did meane I&s;land, if there were no other argument, this one were alone &s;ufficient to prooue it. For I doe not remember that any one of the ancient writers euer tooke vpon him to define Thule according to his length and breadth: only Ptolemey and tho&s;e other au|thours haue pointed at it, as we haue &s;hewed before, and haue told vs whereabout it lieth in the Sea by the longitude and latitude of it, as al&s;o by the &s;ituation of it from Scotland, The Orkeney iles, and Bergen in Norway. Whereas he &s;aith that the length of Ro&s;land is 400 miles, it is, I &s;ay, apparant that he meant I&s;land. For Ortelius in his I&s;land thus writeth of it: <HI>Patet haec in&s;ula in longitudiue centum milliarium Germanicorum, vt vul|gus &s;criptorum habet:</HI> The length of this Iland, as the common &s;ort of writers doe te&s;tifie, is one hundred Germane miles: Now that a common or ordinary Dutch mile, doth containe foure Engli&s;h or Italian miles, it is a thing &s;o commonly knowen that it needeth no proofe. But hauing hand|led, Gentle Reader, the particulars, for the mo&s;t part before in their &s;euerall places, lea&s;t I be too tedious in a thing not greatly needfull I cea&s;e to trouble thee any longer.</P>

<HEAD>GALIZIA, a kingdome of Spaine.</HEAD>
<P>_THe kingdome of GALIZIA is bounded vpon the We&s;t and North, with the Ocean &s;ea; vpon the Ea&s;t, with the A&s;turias and the kingdome of Leon: vpon the South, with the riuer Min~o, and the Kingdome of Portingall. It was &s;ometime, as Ferdinand Oiea, the authour of this Mappe, writeth, much greater then now it is at this daie, and was then held to be one of the lar|ge&s;t kingdomes of all Spaine: For it extended it &s;elfe Ea&s;tward vp as farre as the mountaines of Bi&s;caya, and the head of the great riuer Duero, (<HI>Durius</HI> Pliny calleth it) and &s;o from thence it ranne all along by the banke of this riuer euen till where it falleth into the maine &s;ea, as our &s;aid authour prooueth, by the te&s;timony of Marius Aretius in his de&s;cription of Spaine, of Annius Viterbius, and Floriano de Campo in the 40. chapter of his fourth booke; and likewi&s;e in the third chapter of his fourth booke. It is very vneuen, and mounteinous, or euery where full of dry barrein hils and dales; and therfore much of it, by rea&s;on it wanteth water, is wa&s;te and not inhabited. Their Villages and townes, (e&s;pecially the greater and better &s;ort of them,) are &s;ituate vpon the Sea, or vpon &s;ome great riuer not farre from thence, except San|tiago, Lugo, and Mondon~edo with one or two more. Yet, which is very &s;trange, heere are bred &s;uch woonderfull &s;tore of hor&s;es, that that fable, which reporteth that hereabouts in Spaine the mares conceiue with foale by vertue of the winde, may &s;eeme to be &s;omething probable. Yea and this our authour Fernandez Oiea, &s;aith, that it hath great &s;tore of cattell, and of all manner of Deere a&s;well for nece&s;&s;ary proui&s;ion and mainteinance of the hou&s;e, as for game and di&s;porte for the nobility and gentry of the land. But of Fi&s;h heere taken, not only in the Sea but al&s;o in the fre&s;h riuers, there is &s;uch va|riety and woonderfull &s;tore that it is from hence conueighed to mo&s;t places throughout all Spaine. It hath many hot bathes, and other &s;prings and waters of rare and &s;oueraigne vertues. It yeeldeth great plenty of wine, and that &s;o good, e&s;pecially that which is made about Oren&s;e and Riuadauia, that it is tran&s;ported from hence farre and neere into all coun|tries Chri&s;tian. It offordeth much good fruite of all &s;orts, but e&s;pecially of Limons and Orenges. Silke and Flax, are ve|rie great and gainefull commodities vnto the inhabitants. Heere were &s;ometime, as Pliny te&s;tifieth, very rich Mines of gold. And Niger writeth that, among&s;t the Artabri, (who inhabited not farre from Cape fini&s;ter,) the riuers and brooks did bring downe, after any great &s;tore of raine, Earth mingled with Siluer, Tynne and Gold-ore: yea and that the &s;oile heere was &s;o fertile of Gold, Copper and Lead, that ofttimes the husbandmen with their ploughes did turne vp great cloddes of good gold. Yet we know now, &s;aith Maginus, that the Mines of this country at this day are of no great ac|count. It hath al&s;o &s;ome quarreis of fine marble. Pedro de Medina reckoneth vp three&s;core Cities and townes of note in Galizia, of which the&s;e following are the mo&s;t famous and renowmed, and therefore the more worthy the &s;peaking of in this place. COMPOSTELLA, a goodly city &s;ituate betweene the two riuers Sar, and Sarela, is now commonly called and knowen by the name of SANTIAGO, <HI>Saint Ieame&s;es,</HI> for that the body of the glorious Apo&s;tle Saint Iames, elder brother to Iohn the Euangeli&s;t, who fir&s;t preached the go&s;pel heere and planted Chri&s;tianity among&s;t the Spaniards, lieth heere interred: and in honour of this ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle, by the con&s;ent generally of all, Prince, Nobles and Prelates, it was long &s;ince adorned with the title and dignity of Metropolitan. This by-word is common among&s;t the Spaniards, That there be three Apo&s;tolicall Churches in the world mo&s;t renowmed and famous. Saint Peters in Rome, Saint Ieam&s;es in Spaine, and Saint Iohns in Ephe&s;us. They commonly hold, that the fir&s;t Church that euer was built in Spaine, was that of our Lady in Sarago&s;a, the &s;econd was this of Saint Iames. Heere al&s;o is a goodly Vniuer&s;ity and &s;choole of good lear|ning, where all the Liberall Sciences are profe&s;&s;ed and taught, and many &s;tudents are brought vp and maintained vntill they come to be of age and abilitie for publike &s;eruice either in the Church or Commonwealth. The GROINE, is a very goodly towne, &s;ituate in an i&s;thmos or demy-ile, betweene two baies or creeks of the &s;ea, whereof the one is held to be one of the be&s;t hauens of the world: And therefore heere for the mo&s;t parte of the Kings &s;hips, in time of peace doe lie at anchor. LVGO, one of the principall cities of all Galizia, &s;tandeth vpon the Min~o, not farre from Ca&s;tro de Rey where this riuer ari&s;eth. It is very ancient, and was out of doubt, knowen to the Romans, at &s;uch time they bore the &s;way in the&s;e parts: yet there be &s;ome which doe thinke it to haue beene built by the Vandals, long &s;ince the decay of that e&s;tate. MONDONNEDO is a faire city &s;eated vpon a little riuer toward the Northren &s;ea coa&s;t, not farre from Riuadeo. It was aunciently called <HI>Glandomiro.</HI> ORENSE, &s;ituate vpon the riuer Min~o, is a very great and large citie. The wines that are heere made, are counted to be of the be&s;t, and equall to tho&s;e of Riuadauia. Some thinke that it was in old time called <HI>Auria,</HI> yet the Romans, as it is probable, called it <HI>Aquas Calidas,</HI> of the hotte bathes, which heere are founde, and are now of the Spaniards called <HI>Burgas.</HI> TVY, or, as &s;ome write it, <HI>Tuyd,</HI> built al&s;o vpon the riuer Min~o, not farre from the maine Sea, was fir&s;t founded, as they fable by certaine Greeks, who came hither from Troy with Diomedes. Lucius Marineus Siculus maketh BVRGOS to be a city of Galizia. His words are the&s;e: Burgos, &s;aith he, is a very famous and ancient city of Galizia in Spaine. It was &s;ometime, as &s;ome authours reporte, called <HI>Ma&s;burgi, Liconitiurgis, Brauum,</HI> and <HI>Auca,</HI> or as Pliny writeth it, <HI>Ceuca.</HI> It is a very rich and populous citie, much re&s;orted vnto by Gentlemen and Mar|chants: of the one &s;orte for plea&s;ure, of the other for profit; and therefore it is euery day greatly enlarged with goodly and &s;umptuous newe buildings. If thou de&s;ire more of this city, I wi&s;h thee to repaire to George Braun his Theater of the chiefe cities of the world: If more of this kingdome, read Peter de Medina his <HI>Las Grandezas yco&s;as notabiles de E&s;pan~a,</HI> of the &s;trange and memorable things of Spaine; and I make no doubt, if not with truthes and good hi&s;toricall di&s;cour&s;es, yet with tedious tales and fables, thou &s;halt haue thy belliefull.</P>

<P>_FRANCE (or GALLIA, as the Latines called it,) at this day one of the goodlie&s;t and greate&s;t Kingdomes of Europe, hath notwith&s;tanding in forepa&s;&s;ed ages, beene much larger then now it is. For in Iulius Cae&s;ars time it conteined all that We&s;terne part of the Maineland inhabi|ted and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Belgae, Aquitani, Celtae</HI> and <HI>Heluetij,</HI> bounded vpon the North by the Rhein, vpon the We&s;t by the maine Ocean &s;ea, vpon the South with the Pyreney mountaines, and vpon the Ea&s;t with the &s;tately Alpes. For thus he writeth in the Fir&s;t booke of his Com|mentaries of the warres of France: GALLIA <HI>e&s;t omnis diui&s;a in partes tres: Quarum vnam in|colunt</HI> BELGAE, <HI>aliam</HI> AQVITANI, <HI>tertiam qui ip&s;orum lingua</HI> CELTAE, <HI>no&s;tra</HI> GALLI, <HI>ap|pellantur. Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen, &agrave; Belgis Matrona, et Sequana diuidit.</HI> All FRANCE is diuided into three parts: whereof the one is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the <HI>Belgae,</HI> the other of the <HI>Aquitani,</HI> the third of tho&s;e people which they in their language call <HI>Celtae,</HI> wee in ours <HI>Galli.</HI> The <HI>Galli</HI> (or <HI>Gaules</HI>) are diuided from the Aqui|tanes by the riuer Garonne; and from the <HI>Belgae</HI> by the Marne and Seine. Item a little beneath hee &s;aith that, GALLIA beginneth at the riuer Rho&s;ne, and it is bounded with the Garonne, the Ocean &s;ea, and Belgium; moreouer toward the Sequani and Heluetij it abbutteth vpon the Rhein: It bendeth &s;omewhat Northward. BELGIVM beginneth at the out|mo&s;t borders of Gallia; and from thence it co&s;teth along by the inner &s;ide of the riuer Rhein: It lieth North and by Ea&s;t from the re&s;t of Gallia. AQVITANIA ari&s;eth at the riuer Garonne, and &s;o from thence it falleth downe to the Pyreney mountaines, and the Spani&s;h &s;eas: It lieth We&s;t and by North from the re&s;t of France. Nay be&s;ide this diui&s;ion, there was yet another much more large, extending the bounds of France beyond the Alpes which did include a good part of Italy, and therefore it was of the Romans named GALLIA CISALPINA, Fraunce on this &s;ide the Alpes, or <HI>Italia Gallica,</HI> France in Italy. But of the&s;e and the like diui&s;ions we haue in the former &s;poken plentifully, and therefore we now &s;urcea&s;e to repeat them againe in this place. And we are not ignorant how much of this large compa&s;&s;e heere de&s;cribed is at this day &s;euered from the crowne of France, and hath the&s;e many yeeres beene gouerned by &s;euerall Lords and Princes. A great part of Gallia Belgica, as namely Flaunders, Brabant, Artois, Limburgh and other) belongeth vnto the King of Spaine; Holland, Zeland, with the re&s;t of the Low-countries are gouerned by the States: Zuittzerland, Cleue, Lorrain, Al&s;as, Sauoy, Piemont, and &s;ome other prouinces are held of the Emperour, and are &s;ubiect to their proper Princes: and no one foote, for ought I know, of Italy beyond the Alpes doth belong now to the crowne or kingdome of France. The &s;euerall Shires or Prouinces of this kingdome are very many, whereof the mo&s;t principall are the&s;e, Boulennois, Ponthieu, Caux, Picardy, Normandy, Fraunce, Beau&s;&s;e, Bretaigne, Aniow, Le Maine, Poitow, Lymo&s;in, Santoine, Guien, Ga&s;|coigne, Perigot, Quercy, Champaine, Berrey, Ga&s;tinois, Sologne, Auuergne, Niuernois, Lyomois, Charrolois, Bour|bonois, Maine, Daulphein, Prouince, Languedocke, Bloys, or Bla&s;ois, Forram, Burgundy, La Franche Conte, Verman|dois and &s;ome few others mentioned in this Mappe. The whole land generally is very fertile and withall pa&s;&s;ing plea&s;ant and healthfull: and thereupon they v&s;e to &s;ay that Lombardy is the garden of Italy, and France is the garden of Europe. Yet &s;ome places are more fertile for &s;ome one commodity then others are. Picardy, Normandy, and Languedocke are as goodly countries for Corne, as any in all Chri&s;tendome be&s;ide. Some places doe afforde great &s;tore of fruits, &s;ome as great plenty of Wood: In &s;ome places Flax and Hempe doe grow in great abundance, in other places they make as great a commoditie of their Woad. The whole countrey generally in all places affordeth much wine, but the be&s;t is made in Beau&s;&s;e about Orleans. They haue &s;ome mines of Iron, but many of Salt. Whereupon La No&uuml;e &s;aith, that the Corne, Wine, Salt and Woad that is from hence tran&s;ported into forraine Countries, doth bring in yeerely to the &s;ub|iects and crowne of France twelue hundred thou&s;and pounds of currant mony. And Iohn Bodine affirmeth that Such &s;prings of Corne, Salt and wine doe heere flow &s;o copiou&s;ly, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to empty them or drawe them quit dry. Another, a country man of ours, a worthy gentleman and of as good iudgement, as the be&s;t of them, &s;aith that in the prouince of Limo&s;in, are the be&s;t Beeues: about Orleans, the be&s;t Wines: in Auuergne, the be&s;t Swine; and in Berry, the choi&s;e&s;t Mutton, and greate&s;t &s;tore of Sheepe. In France there are twelue Archbi&s;hoprickes: and one hun|dred and foure Suffraganes, or Bi&s;hops. Bodine &s;aith that there are in France twentie &s;euen thou&s;and and foure hundred Pari&s;h Churches, counting onely euery city for a Pari&s;h. The cities and walled townes in this country are very many, but of them all PARIS is the chiefe, which doth as much excell the re&s;t, as the lofty cedar doth the lowe&s;t &s;hrubbes: And I haue heard &s;ay, if my memory faile me not, that the King of France, being demaunded by an Emba&s;&s;adour, how many cities there were in all that his whole country and kingdome, reckoned vp a great number, and among&s;t them made no mention at all of Paris: and being againe asked the rea&s;on why he did not account that for one among&s;t the re&s;t, an&s;wea|red that Paris was another world. This towne is &s;eated in the Ile of France vpon the riuer Sein, in as plea&s;ant and fertile a place as el&s;ewhere may be found in this whole kingdome. It is a very ancient city, called by Cae&s;ar <HI>Lutetia,</HI> by Ptolemey <HI>Lucotecia,</HI> and by Iulianus in his Mi&s;opogonus, Leucetia. Zo&s;imus nameth it <HI>Pari&s;ium,</HI> and Marcellinus, <HI>Ca&s;tellum Pari|&s;iorum,</HI> The ca&s;tle of the Pari&s;ij: For this prouince which now they call properly France, or The Ile of France, was the ancient &s;eat and habitation of the Pari&s;ij. The riuer Sein, <HI>(Sequana)</HI> parting it &s;elfe into two &s;treames, diuideth this towne into three parts, to wit, The <HI>Burge</HI> vpon the North &s;ide: The <HI>Vniuer&s;ity,</HI> vpon the South: and The <HI>Ville,</HI> in the midde&s;t, in the ile afore&s;aid, which &s;eemeth to be the old towne mentioned by Cae&s;ar. For thus he writeth in the &s;euenth booke of his Commentaries of the warres of France: <HI>Id oppidum (Lutetia</HI> hee meaneth) <HI>Pari&s;iorum, po&s;itum in in&s;ula fluminis Sequanae.</HI> Lutetia that towne of the Pari&s;ij, is &s;ituate in an iland in the riuer Sein. It is, as our learned country|man reporteth, tenne Engli&s;h miles about by the wals. The Vniuer&s;ity was founded by Charles the Great in the yeere of our Lord eight hundred. For other particulars I wi&s;h thee to looke backe to that which we haue written before gene|rally of France, or particularly of diuers and &s;undry &s;euerall Prouinces of the &s;ame. And be&s;ide tho&s;e authours before named, thou maie&s;t adioine that our learned countriemam, who not long &s;ince &s;et out a di&s;cour&s;e of this kingdome inti|tuled, The view of France.</P>

<HEAD>The Duchie of LIMBORGH, in the Low Countries.</HEAD>
<P>_GERMANIA INFERIOR, or, as we now call it, The Low countries, is at this day diuided into the&s;e &s;euenteene prouinces: to wit, foure <HI>Duchies,</HI> Brabant, Limbourgh, Lukenburgh &amp; Guel|derland: &s;euen <HI>Counties,</HI> or <HI>Earldomes,</HI> Flanders, Artois, Heinault, Holland, Zeland, Namur, and Zurphen: one <HI>Marqui&s;ate,</HI> commonly called The Marqui&s;ate of the Sacred Empire: fiue <HI>Grand Signeories,</HI> Frizeland, Mechlin, Vtreckt, Ouer-i&s;&s;el, and Groninghen. Of the mo&s;t of the&s;e we haue in the former &s;poken &s;euerally and at large, onely of Limborgh, which although it be one of the lea&s;t, yet in honor and dignity not the lea&s;t, we haue hitherto &s;poken little or no|thing. The Dukedome of LIMBOVRGH, therefore, is a very little prouince, &s;ituate in the mid|de&s;t betweene the Duchie of Gulich, Gelderland, the Bi&s;hopricke of Leege and Lutzenburge: The citie Limburgh, or as they vulgarly call it <HI>Lympurch,</HI> the chiefe towne of this prouince and whereof it tooke the name, &s;tandeth vpon the riuer We&s;&s;e, or We&s;do, as they name it, and is di&s;tant from Aix three leagues, but from Leige it is foure at the lea&s;t or &s;omewhat more. It is a very &s;trong towne both by nature and arte: For being built vpon the ri&s;ing of a &s;tony hill, it is enclo&s;ed round with a very defen&s;ible wall, garded heere and there with di|uers &s;trong towers, be&s;ide a goodly large Ca&s;tle all of free &s;tone vpon the toppe of the hill. The &s;ituation and pro&s;pect of this citie is mo&s;t plea&s;ant and commendable. For at the foote of the hill, at the townes &s;ide, runneth the riuer, vnto which adioineth a goodly fertile plaine where daily great &s;tore of cattell are kept and mainteined to the great commodity and gaine of the inhabitants round about. This city is not ancient, nor once mentioned by any old writer, as D. Remacle Fu&s;ch, a learned Phy&s;ician, this countriman borne, plainly confe&s;&s;eth, and yet he &s;aith that hee had diligently &s;earched and turned ouer all authours, who either of &s;et purpo&s;e, or by the way, haue handled that kind of argument. The &s;oile is very good and fertile, both for corne and pa&s;ture, e&s;pecially about Heruey, a fine village not farre from Clermont. Onely wine it yeeldeth none at all; but in &s;ted of that, they make of barley &s;teeped and &s;odden, a kinde of very &s;trong drinke, which will a&s;&s;oone make the to&s;&s;e-pot drunke, as the &s;tronge&s;t wine in France. Lewis Guicciardine writeth that, about halfe a Dutch mile off, from this towne, there is a Mine or quarry of &s;tone, that is very like to mettall: of Pliny, in the 10. Chapter of the foure and thirtieth booke of his Naturall hi&s;torie it is called <HI>Lapis aero&s;us, Cadmia,</HI> and <HI>lapis calaminaris</HI> (if I be not deceiued) The bra&s;&s;e &s;tone, or Copper ore. D. Fu&s;ch te&s;tifieth that it hath al&s;o diuer&s;e veines of Lead and Iron. A kinde of blacke &s;tone cole, like vnto that which we heere call Seacoale, of a &s;ulphurous nature, a good fuell and much v&s;ed of Farriers and Smithes, is in diuers places of the country digged out of the ground in great abundance. Moreouer heere are found diuers &s;orts of &s;tone, not much vnlike to Marble or Ia&s;per party coloured, very beautiful and good for buil|ding. This countrey at the fir&s;t was no more but a County or Earldome: vntill that Fredericke, &s;urnamed Barbaro&s;&s;o, in the yeere of our Lord 1172. graced it with the title and dignity of a Duchie. The fir&s;t Duke that enioied this honor was Henry the Fir&s;t, lineally de&s;cended from Henry the Fourth, that valiant and religious Emperour. At length Henry the Second Duke of Limburgh, dying without heire male, Iohn the Fir&s;t Duke of Brabant, about the yeere after Chri&s;ts in|carnation 1293, by right of inheritance claimed the &s;ame, and by dint of &s;worde, driuing out Reynold Earle of Gelderland, the V&s;urper, obteined it, &s;ince who&s;e daies it hath beene quietly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Brabant. Therefore for iu&s;tice in ciuill cau&s;es, not only Limburg, but al&s;o Faulconburg, Dalem and other liberties and free townes beyond the Mo&s;e, do come to the courts of Brabant, which ordinarily are held at Bru&s;&s;els: otherwi&s;e for eccle&s;ia&s;ticall iuri&s;diction they doe be|long to the dioce&s;&s;es of that Bi&s;hop of Leige. But be&s;ide this dukedome of Limburgh there are diuers other Iur&s;dictions and Signiories de&s;cribed in this Charte; of the which the&s;e following are the chiefe, whereof it &s;hal not be ami&s;&s;e to &s;peake a word or two. <HI>Faulconburgh, (Valckembourg</HI> it is called of the Dutch, but of the French, <HI>Fauquemont</HI>) is a very prety towne, which hath iuri&s;diction and command ouer a large circuite of ground conteining many fine villages. It is three great Dutch miles from Aix, and but two &s;mall miles from Ma&s;tricht. It was conquered and taken by Iohn the third, Duke of Brabant; who ouercame Ramot the Lord of Faulconburgh, a trouble&s;ome man, that at that time laid &s;eege to Ma&s;tricht and had much and oft vexed the country round about him. DALEM is a prety fine towne, with a Ca&s;tle, but of no great &s;trength. It is three long miles from Aix, and two from Liege: It was honoured with the title of an Earldome, and had iuri&s;diction and command ouer many villages and a great circuit of ground vp as high as the riuer of Mo&s;e. Henry the Se|cond, Duke of Brabant conquered it and adioined it to his dominions. ROIDVCK, or, as Guicciardin calleth it <HI>Rhode|le-duc,</HI> is an ancient little towne with an old Ca&s;tle, about one long Dutch mile, as the forenamed authour would haue it, from Faulconburg: yet this our Mappe maketh it about two. AIX or AIX LACHAPELLE, if we may beleeue Mun|&s;ter, was that which the Latines called <HI>Aqui&s;granum</HI> &s;o much &s;poken of and mentioned in the &s;tories of Charles the Great and others of tho&s;e times. Others would haue it to be that which Ptolemey in the 9 chapter of the &s;econd booke of his Geography calleth <HI>Veterra,</HI> and where he &s;aith the thirtieth Legion, called <HI>Vlpia legio</HI> did re&s;ide. Limprand nameth it <HI>Pa|lais de Grau,</HI> Rheginon, <HI>Palais de eaux,</HI> that is, the Water palace; which in my iudgement &s;eemeth mo&s;t probable; be|cau&s;e I find that that city in Prouence in France which the Romans called <HI>Aquae Sextiae,</HI> the Frenchmen do at this day call <HI>Aix.</HI> This city is &s;ituate betweene Brabant, Limburgh, the Duchie of Gulicke, and the Bi&s;hopricke of Liege. Some thinke that it was de&s;troied and laid leuell with the ground by Attila king of the Humes: others thinke that it was fir&s;t founded by Charles the Great. But to leaue all the&s;e as doubtfull, this is certeine that it &s;tandeth in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant plaine and as healthfull and &s;weet an aire, as any may be el&s;where found in the&s;e parts. That faire Church, of our Sauiour and the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin his mother, was built by this Emperour, and by him was endowed with great lands, priuiledges, ma|ny holy and precious reliques brought thither from &s;undry places of the world. Beatus Rhenanus writeth that Charles the Great made it the head and chiefe city of the kingdome of France, and generally of all the whole Empire, the ordinary Court and place of re&s;idence for the Emperour in the&s;e We&s;terne parts of the &s;ame. Moreouer he ordained that heere the Emperour &s;hould, by the Bi&s;hop of Collen, Metropolitan of this prouince, be crowned with a crown of Iron: at Millan, with a crowne of Siluer; and at Rome with a crowne of Gold. Ouer one of the doores of the Towne-hou&s;e are written the&s;e &s;ix Latine ver&s;es, <HI>Carolus in&s;ignem reddens hanc condidit vrbem, Quam libertauit po&s;t Romam: con&s;tituendo, Qu&ograve;d &s;it trans Alpes hic &s;emper regia &s;edes: Vt caput vrbs cuncta colat hanc, &amp; Gallia tota. Gaudet Aqui&s;granum prae cunctis munere clarum, Quae prius imperij leges nunc laureat almi.</HI> And ouer another doore, the&s;e two, <HI>H&icirc;c &s;edes regni trans Al|pes habeatur, Caput omnium ciuitatum, &amp; prouinciarum Galliae.</HI> This famous Emperour hauing reigned ouer the French|men 47. yeares and worne the imperiall diadem 14. ended his life in the yeere of our Lord 813. and was heere enterred in a tombe of Marble, in our Ladies Church with this plaine epitaph; <HI>Caroli Magni Chri&s;tiani&s;simi, Romanorum Imperatoris Corpus hoc conditum e&s;t &s;epulchro.</HI> That is, the body of Charles the Great, Emperour of the Romans, lieth heere inter|red in this tombe. Thus farre Guicciardine, to whom I wi&s;h thee to repaire if thou de&s;ire a larger di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e par|ticulars.</P>

<P>_TO &s;atisfie your reque&s;t concerning the Name and &s;ituation of the ile MONA, mo&s;t learned Ortell, and to &s;et downe in writing what I haue ob&s;erued of that argument in the reading of ancient and moderne authours, what I haue found by experience and trauell, and what I haue gathered by the knowledge of the Briti&s;h tongue which to this day is &s;poken vulgarly by the inhabitants of this iland, were but &s;o much as I confe&s;&s;e is due to your kinde loue and manifold courte&s;ies, whereby you haue many wayes eternally bound me vnto you: Notwith&s;tanding in &s;o doing I am &s;ure to be &s;euerely cen&s;ured of many, condemned of &s;ome, and generally to be &s;ubiect and op|po&s;ed to the obloquy, and &s;candalous &s;peeches of the ba&s;er &s;ort, &s;uch I mean as haue no maner of learning or &s;ound iudgement. For a preiudicate opinion, though neuer &s;o fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, nay euen the gro&s;&s;e&s;t errors if they be once receiued and &s;etled in the heart, will hardly euer be remoued, e&s;pecially being patro|naged and defended by the authority of Polydore Virgil, a graue learned man, and one that for tho&s;e times was accounted very eloquent. But by their leaue I may &s;ay, That this man hath &s;tuffed his Hi&s;tories with many manife&s;t errours, <HI>mille mendis &amp; mendacijs,</HI> with a thou&s;and faults and fal&s;hoods; which he fell into, not only for that he wanted the knowledge of the Briti&s;h tongue, (which now the Engli&s;h, after the maner of the Germans, call Wel&s;h, that is, Strange or Barbarous) without which euen the very name of the iland can by no meanes be truely vnder&s;tood: But al&s;o either for that he neuer read the be&s;t of our Authours, or els for that he bearing a proud &s;plene and malice again&s;t the Britons, (whom the be&s;t and mo&s;t honorable of all the Romane Emperours did loue and greatly e&s;teeme) little weighed their authority, and haughtilie attributing too much to his owne, neglected the better, and followed the &s;teps, poore blinde man, of one William Little, little in name and little in e&s;timation and credit, as blinde a foole as him&s;elfe. But let this bra&s;en faced dimini&s;her of the Britons honour, bur&s;t him&s;elfe if he will, and do what he can to the vttermo&s;t of his might and malice, &s;o long as Diodorus Siculus, Dion Ca&s;sius, twi&s;e Con&s;ul of Rome, Herodian, Plu|tarch, Pau&s;anias, Ptolemey and Strabo, are extant among&s;t the Greekes; Cae&s;ars Commentaries, Tacitus his Annals, Eutropius, Suetonius, Oro&s;ius, Aelius Spartianus, Iulius Capitolinus, Aelius Lampridius, Flaui|us Vopi&s;cus, Aurelius Victor, Ammianus Marcellinus, Sextus Rufus, The Panegyricks of Mamertinus and others, Pliny, Antonine, Mela and Solinus, among&s;t the Latines; be&s;ide the Annals of the three Gilda&s;es, Ninnius, and diuers other very learned men, written many hundred yeres &s;ince in the Briti&s;h tongue, who before the comming of the Engli&s;h, (which our countreymen to this day call by their ancient name, <HI>Sax|ons</HI>) haue learnedly penned the hi&s;tories of this their natiue countrey: and be&s;ide A&s;&s;erius, Obbern, Felix Monumeten&s;is, Henricus Huntingtonen&s;is, Malmesburien&s;is, Annouillanus, I&s;canus, Neccham, Gyraldus Pari&s;ien&s;is, Trenetus, and infinite others, which &s;ince tho&s;e Saxons conquered that part of the iland, (which they call England, but we, reteining the old name Lho&euml;gria,) haue done the like. Let, I &s;ay, this proud Italian bur&s;t him&s;elfe, and let him &s;narle at the worthy acts of the Britons, while &s;o many, and &s;uch ancient authours do liue to &s;ound the trumpe of their honour, no impudent lying fellow &s;hall euer be able with his calumnies to ob&s;cure the bright lu&s;ture of the Britons glory, to impeach the honourable fame of their re|nowmed deeds, &s;pread abroad by &s;uch worthy men, or to fa&s;ten the lea&s;t infamy vpon them. But now it is time to come to our propo&s;ed argument, and to &s;peake more particularly of MONA, which Polydore Virgil, taking vpon him more than he well might, hath depriued of the ancient name, and leauing it name|le&s;&s;e, hath giuen both it and Menauia, to the Ile of Man, as may thus be proued both out of the Greeke, La|tine, and Briti&s;h writers, as al&s;o out of the language which here to this day is &s;poken by the inhabitants. It is apparent out of Cae&s;ar, Tacitus, and others, that MONA was an iland very neere to the coa&s;t of Bri|taine, betweene it and Ireland: In which Sea there are but two (be&s;ide the Hebrides) that are of any note and bigne&s;&s;e: Therefore it mu&s;t needs follow, that one of tho&s;e two is that MONA which is &s;o often men|tioned in ancient hi&s;tories: Wherefore I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e to &s;et downe before your eyes the po&s;ition of them both, and how they do lie from the coa&s;t of England &amp; other ilands round about them, that by that meanes that which followeth may the better be vnder&s;tood. The fir&s;t of the&s;e, which Polydore calleth ANGLESEY, is very neere to that part of Britaine, which we call <HI>Cumry,</HI> and the Engli&s;h, <HI>Wales,</HI> from which it is &s;euered by a very narrow frith or bay of the &s;ea, (the countrey people call it <HI>Menai</HI>) which ouer|again&s;t the midde&s;t of the iland, is hardly a mile ouer. Vpon the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this ile there is a very &s;trong ca&s;tle, and a prety fine citie, called Beaumari&s;h, <HI>(Bellum mari&s;cum)</HI> both built by Edward the Fir&s;t, King of
<PB REF="340"> England. On the other &s;ide of the iland, oppo&s;ite to this city, there is a maruellous conuenient place to take &s;hipping for Ireland, and therefore it is much for that purpo&s;e re&s;orted vnto and frequented by the Engli&s;h. They call it <HI>Holy-head,</HI> but of the Wel&s;h men it is called <HI>Ca&euml;rgybi,</HI> that is, Gubche&s;ter, or, The citie of Kybi. In this iland is <HI>Aberfraw,</HI> which within the&s;e three or foure hundred yeeres was the chiefe &s;eat where ordinarily the King of Northwales, (<HI>Gwynedia,</HI> or as &s;ome barbarou&s;ly write it <HI>Venedocia</HI>) did re&s;ide and keepe his Court. This iland, for the bigne&s;&s;e of it, mainteineth and breedeth much <HI>cattell</HI> and <HI>&s;heepe.</HI> It yeerely yeeldeth &s;uch plentie of <HI>wheat,</HI> that in re&s;pect of that fertility it is commonly called, <HI>The mother of Wales.</HI> They haue little wood here growing: yet euery day the bodies of huge trees, with their roots, and &s;irre trees of a woonderfull length and bigne&s;&s;e, are heere by the inhabitants found and digged out of the earth in diuers places, in low grounds and champion fields. The people &s;peake the Wel&s;h tongue, and for the mo&s;t part they do not vnder&s;tand one word of Engli&s;h: notwith&s;tanding they haue for the&s;e three hu~|dred yeeres and more beene &s;ubiect, as the re&s;t of Wales hath beene, to the Kings and Crowne of England. But now let vs come to the other iland, to which al&s;o Polydore Virgil hath not long &s;ince without any ground or good authoritie, giuen the name of MONA. That &s;tandeth in the midde&s;t of the maine &s;ea, di&s;tant from the neere&s;t place of England at the lea&s;t fiue and twentie miles. It is almo&s;t as bigge as that o|ther, but it is farre more barren and wa&s;te, and tho&s;e men that are borne and bred there, are weake and no|thing &s;o fit for the warres and &s;eruice in the field, only tho&s;e excepted that are &s;ent thither by the Earle of Darbie, to whom this ile doth by right of inheritance from his ance&s;tours belong. They do &s;peake the Scoti&s;h language, or the Iri&s;h, as you plea&s;e to call it, for they be both one. The one is as farre from Ire|land as the other. The&s;e things being taught and conceiued, let vs now heare what the Romans haue writ|ten of <HI>Mona.</HI> The fir&s;t authour that euer made mention of it, as I remember, was Cae&s;ar; next after him, Pliny and Dion Ca&s;sius: But they doe but name it only, and withall affirme it to be &s;ituate in the maine &s;ea betweene England and Ireland. Thus much we both confe&s;&s;e. Cornelius Tacitus, a very learned man, and one that by meanes of Iulius Agricola, his father in law, very well knew the &s;tate of Britaine then, of the &s;ituation and di&s;tance of Mona from the Continent, teacheth vs many things making much to this our purpo&s;e. Therefore let vs li&s;ten awhile to that which he &s;peaketh in the foureteenth booke of his Annals: <HI>But then was Paulinus Suetonius Lieutenant of Britaine, one that for his great experience and knowledge of militarie matters, popular fame, and e&s;timation amongst the meaner &s;ort of men, (which for the most part &s;uffereth no man of rare virtues and qualities to liue without a compere) did alwayes contend with Corbulo, labouring by all meanes po&s;siblie to match that his honou|rable &s;eruice in conquering Armenia, by ouercomming and quieting tho&s;e Rebels which in the&s;e parts did &s;tand out against the Romans. Therefore he maketh great preparation, and prouideth all things nece&s;&s;arie for the a&s;&s;ault and taking of the iland</HI> Mo|na, <HI>a place not only by nature, but al&s;o by rea&s;on of the multitude of people which do there inhabit, very &s;trong and defencible, and is indeed the &s;anctuarie and place of common refuge for all &s;uch as runne away from their Capteines or Commanders. He cau&s;ed boats to be made with flat bottomes, becau&s;e the &s;ea there neere the &s;hore is verie &s;hallow, and euerie where full of flats and &s;helfs. Thus they conueyed ouer the footmen, the hor&s;men followed them partly wading thorow the foords and &s;hallow pla|ces, and partly &s;wimming where the waters were more deepe. Vpon the &s;hore, to empeach our landing, a very great armie, ve|rie well appointed and armed for all a&s;&s;aies, &s;tood clo&s;e thronging together, intermedled with women running to and fro betweene the ranks with torches in their hands, in mourning gownes and their haire about their eares, of all the world like to the Furies or madde women. The Druides al&s;o on euerie &s;ide with hands lifted vp to heauen, powring out many bitter cur&s;es and deadlie im|precation, with the &s;trangene&s;&s;e of that &s;ight &s;trooke the &s;ouldiers into &s;uch a dampe, that they &s;tood &s;tone &s;till, not once moouing their bodies, as if they had willingly offered their throats to the enemie: yet at length by the exhortation and encouragement of the Generall, and one animating and heartening on another, that they might not &s;eeme to be afrayd of a companie of &s;eelie women and other frantike people, they aduance forward the &s;tanderd, display their banners, and &s;uch as offered to re&s;ist, they beat to the ground, and force them to runne into their owne fires. This being done, he placed garri&s;ons in their townes and villages, and cau&s;ed their woods to be cut downe and vtterlie de&s;troyed; which, by rea&s;on of their cruell ceremonies and &s;uper&s;titious &s;acrifices there offered, were by them e&s;teemed holy. For they accounted it lawfull to embrue their altars wth the blood of their captiues, and to &s;eeke to know the &s;ecret coun&s;ell of the eternall God and euents to come by the entrailes and bowels of men.</HI> Thou heare&s;t, gentle Reader, how the footmen followed the hor&s;men in the foords and &s;hallowes, and where the water was more deepe, they &s;womme ouer with the hor&s;es. The &s;ame Authour al&s;o, &s;etting forth, in the life of Iulius Agricola, the &s;ame Agricola's voyage into this iland, writeth on this maner: MONAM <HI>in&s;ulam, cuius po&s;&s;e&s;sionem reuocatum Paulinum, &amp;c.</HI> Thus tran&s;lated by the learned Sir Henrie Sauile (for I know not whe|ther Great Tacitus &s;corneth any other interpretor or no) <HI>He deliberated to conquer the iland</HI> Mona: <HI>from the po&s;|&s;e&s;sion whereof, as before I haue rehear&s;ed, Paullinus was reuoked by the generall rebellion of Britanie: But as in a purpo&s;e not purpo&s;ed before, &s;hips being wanting, the policie and re&s;olutene&s;&s;e of the Captaine deui&s;ed a pa&s;&s;age, commanding the mo&s;t choi&s;e of the Aides, to whom all the &s;hallowes were knowen, and who after the v&s;e of their countrey were able in &s;wimming to gouerne them&s;elues with armour and hor&s;es, laying a&s;ide their cariage, to put ouer at once, and &s;uddenly to inuade them. VVhich thing &s;o ama&s;ed the enemie, attending for &s;hips and &s;uch proui&s;ion by &s;ea, that &s;urely beleeuing nothing could be hard or inuincible to men which came &s;o minded to warre, they humbly intreated for peace, and yeelded the Iland. Thus Agricola at his fir&s;t entrance into his prouince (which time others con&s;ume in vaine o&s;tentation and ambitious &s;eeking of ceremonies) entring withall into labours and dangers, became famous indeed and of great reputation.</HI> Here thou &s;ee&s;t againe, how the &s;ouldiers gat into Mo|na by &s;wimming without the helpe of any &s;hips or boats. Neither did this our authour heare this from the
<PB REF="340"> report of any ob&s;cure fellow of little knowledge and le&s;&s;e vnder&s;tanding in the&s;e matters, but euen from the mouth of Agricola him&s;elfe, his wiues father, a man very famous, and one that was the Generall and chiefe commander in this voyage. But marke, I pray you, how Polydore Virgil an&s;wereth all this: For thus he writeth in the fir&s;t booke of his Hi&s;torie of England. This &s;ometime (he &s;peaketh of Mona) was &s;euered from Britaine by a very narrow arme of the &s;ea, &s;o that &s;o oft as the &s;ea did ebbe, which heere at all times maketh very high tides, it was &s;o neere to the Continent, that men might go thither without boats. And againe, a little beneath he writeth thus of it: See, &s;ayth he, what continuance of time can bring to pa&s;&s;e, That iland is now fiue and twentie miles from any part of England, which &s;ometime was &s;car&s;e one mile from it. What will not malice, and a cro&s;&s;e humour alwaies oppo&s;ing it &s;elfe again&s;t other mens opinions, although neuer &s;o much turning to his owne di&s;grace and di&s;credit, yea euen in the be&s;t wits, force a man to do! This Italian dreameth of a &s;trange inundation and ouerflowing of the &s;ea, whereof neuer any Hi|&s;torian, Latine, Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h or Scoti&s;h euer &s;pake, I dare auouch, one word: and that which is mo&s;t &s;trange of all, the countrey people neuer haue heard, as &s;eemeth, from their ance&s;tours, of any &s;uch kinde of drowning. He complaineth al&s;o of the &s;traightne&s;&s;e of that other iland, and of the &s;car&s;itie of Corne and Wood. Where al&s;o I could wi&s;h that the Authour had had a little more di&s;cretion and hone&s;tie: For this iland (I meane his Angli&s;ea, which indeed is the true Mona) is about fiue and twentie Engli&s;h miles long, and &s;ixteene miles ouer, euery mile containing one thou&s;and and two hundred Geographicall pa&s;es. Therefore it conteineth in compa&s;&s;e well neere three&s;core and twelue Italian miles: For in &s;ome places it is not full &s;ixteene miles ouer. That which he &s;peaketh of the &s;car&s;itie of wood here, it is very true: For Ta|citus reporteth that the woods were cut downe and de&s;troyed by the Romans, an infinite number of the bodies of which, as I haue &s;hewed before, couered with earth and hid within the ground, are at this day by the countrey people found in &s;undry places of the ile. And that there haue beene woods here within the&s;e foure hundred yeeres or thereabouts, it is very manife&s;t by our hi&s;tories. Of the barrenne&s;&s;e of this Iland I know not well what to &s;ay, &s;eeing that he is not a&s;hamed to write that which all men do know to be mo&s;t fal&s;e: For &s;uch is the fertilitie of this iland, that our people v&s;e to &s;ay prouerbially, that Angle&s;ey is the mother of Wales <HI>(Mon mam Gymry.)</HI> Moreouer, the inhabitants (for their proportion, and &s;tate of our coun|trey) are verie wealthie, and withall, &s;tout and valiant, as appeareth out of the Engli&s;h Hi&s;toriographers: For the Engli&s;h men haue oft times a&s;&s;aulted this iland by &s;ea, and laboured to get the po&s;&s;e&s;sion thereof, but all in vaine: For they haue been alwaies there &s;laine, or put to the wor&s;t. This, Hugh Earle of Shrew&s;|burie and Arundell there &s;laine, can te&s;tifie to be true. This al&s;o Henrie the naturall &s;onne of Henrie the Fir&s;t, with many noble men with him there &s;laine can well te&s;tifie. [How true this is I can not tell; but this I finde, that two Hughs of the Norman blood, the one Earle of Che&s;ter, the other Earle of Shrewsbu|rie, did enter this iland, greatly vexe the inhabitants; and that they might the better retaine them in due obedience, did build the ca&s;tle at Aber Lhienioc: and of the&s;e two, Hugh Earle of Che&s;ter was indeed there &s;laine: but how? not in the entrance or a&s;&s;ault of the ile, but in the defence of it after he had gotten quiet po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the &s;ame? yet not by the Wel&s;h men, but by the Norweighians, who vnder the conduct of Magnus their Generall landed heere, &s;lew many of the people, robbed the countrey, and departed with great &s;poile. Of that Henrie I finde not one word in others.] What &s;hould I &s;ay more? Polydore Virgils Mona di&s;tant from the coa&s;t of Britaine twentie fiue miles, no whit bigger than this, but much more bar|ren, and &s;uch as breedeth a weaker kinde of men de&s;cended from the Iri&s;h, euen by the iudgement of Poly|dore him&s;elfe, doth now renounce the title of Mona. But what other men al&s;o do thinke of this matter, let vs heare in few words. Ptolemey the Prince of Geographers, vpon the Ea&s;t &s;ide of Ireland placeth foure i|lands, MONARINA (or as other copies do reade, <HI>Monaida</HI>) MONA, ADROS and LYMNOS. The two latter are very well knowen vnto vs at this day; for that indeed they doe &s;till reteine tho&s;e auncient names. Adros of our countrey men is called <HI>Ynys ador,</HI> that is, as the words doe &s;ignifie, <HI>The iland of birds.</HI> Lymnos they now call <HI>Enlli,</HI> which the Engli&s;h men call <HI>Barde&s;ey,</HI> that is, as he would faine interpret it, <HI>In&s;ula Bardo|rum,</HI> The Bardes iland. [But I doubt whether our Saxons did euer vnder&s;tand what the Britons <HI>Bardi</HI> meant: yet of this I am &s;ure, that the learned M. Camden in his Britannia is of another opinion.] Of the other two then, the one mu&s;t of nece&s;sity be our Mona, the other Polydores Mona. Monaria is by Ptolemey placed much farther Northward than Mona, and Mona hee maketh to lie &s;omewhat more Ea&s;terly than Monaria: For this, Monaria, I meane, or Monaoeda, as Ptolemeyes copies vulgarly haue it, lieth, as he wri|teth, from the Canaries Ea&s;tward 17 degrees and 40 minutes, but vp &s;o high into the North, that the pole there is eleuated aboue the horizont 61 degrees and 30 minutes: when as the other, to wit, Mona, lieth from the Canaries but 15 degrees, and from the North but 57 degrees and 40 minutes. Polydores Mona leaneth both more toward the North and Ea&s;t than ours doth: Therefore it is Ptolemeys Monaria that he &s;peaketh of, not Ptolemeys Mona. And this our Mona &s;hall &s;till reteine that ancient name of Mona, which Ptolemey gaue vnto it in his time. This we haue collected out of forreine hi&s;tories: Now let vs come to our owne Writers, who I thinke, in a matter of names of places in their owne country and language ought rather to be beleeued than an Italian, a meere &s;tranger borne and brought vp beyond the &s;eas, farre from this our countrey. But that the&s;e things may the better be vnder&s;tood, &s;ome few lines are here by the way to be in&s;erted. All men do know and confe&s;&s;e this to be true, that the Britons, before the entrance of the
<PB REF="341"> Engli&s;h or Saxons did po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e this whole iland: vntill &s;uch time as being by them conquered and &s;ubdued, they were forced to abandon the better part of the &s;ame, leauing it to the po&s;&s;e&s;sion of their enemies; and to content them&s;elues with the We&s;tern parts only: And they being thus &s;eated, were called by the names of the places were they dwelt, as for example tho&s;e which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Cambria, were named <HI>Cambri:</HI> tho&s;e which inhabited <HI>Cornouia,</HI> were knowen and called by the name of the <HI>Cornouij.</HI> Yet the Engli&s;h men did, after the maner of the Dutch (who name the French and Italians, <HI>VVel&s;h</HI>) call them all generally <HI>VVel&s;hmen:</HI> Adding for difference &s;ake the names of the countries, as it is manife&s;t by tho&s;e hi&s;tories, which yet are ex|tant, written in the Saxon tongue. For tho&s;e our <HI>Brits,</HI> are in them called <HI>VValae:</HI> and the Cornouij, <HI>Corn|walae;</HI> not, as the vnlearned do thinke, <HI>Cornugalliae.</HI> Neither can I with &s;ilence ouerpa&s;&s;e that &s;hamele&s;&s;e im|pudencie of Polydore, who braggeth that he was the fir&s;t that euer found this out, and committed the &s;ame to writing; when it is mo&s;t certeine that he &s;tole this etymologie and rea&s;on why this our countrie was cal|led Wales, out of Sylue&s;ter Giraldus. But, that I may returne vnto that where I left, the Wel&s;hmen being thus cooped vp into a corner, did notwith&s;tanding reteine the ancient Briti&s;h tongue: &s;o that the Coun|tries, Cities, Riuers, Ilands, and people of Britaine, are by the Wel&s;hmen called by tho&s;e names whereby they were knowen and called at &s;uch time as they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the whole. For our countrey people, &s;uch I meane as are borne and brought vp farre within the land, do not know what the name of an Engli&s;h man doth meane, but all the Engli&s;h they do generally terme <HI>Sai&s;&s;on,</HI> that is, Saxons, (for they haue no <HI>x</HI>) Eng|land they call by the ancient name <HI>Lho&euml;ger:</HI> Wales, <HI>Cambri:</HI> Cornwall, <HI>Corniw:</HI> Scotland, <HI>Alban:</HI> Ireland, <HI>Yuerdhon:</HI> and indeed &s;ome old Writers do write the name of this iland not <HI>Hibernia,</HI> but <HI>Iuernia,</HI> as M. Cam|den &s;heweth at large in his Britannia. So al&s;o we doe &s;till call all the Cities of England by tho&s;e names whereby they were &s;ometime called before the entrance of the Saxons. But let vs come againe to Mona. Our countreymen and the inhabitants of this ile (&s;peaking now at this day the ancient Briti&s;h tongue) doe know no other name of it than MON, for &s;o they all generally call it. Polydore Virgil calleth it ANGLE|SEA, that is, The Engli&s;h ile. I grant that this iland being &s;ubdued by the Engli&s;h men, was beautified and graced with their name, and that the Engli&s;h men do &s;o call it I do not denie. But, I pray thee, did the Eng|li&s;h men fir&s;t de&s;crie this iland, was it neuer &s;eene before, or had it no name at all before their comming? Heare&s;t thou Polydore, bethinke thy &s;elfe; thou maye&s;t a&s;well &s;ay that England is not that land which was &s;ometime called Britannia, nor that was not Gallia, which now we call France. Nay, which is a greater mat|ter than this, and more &s;trange, the inhabitants of this ile (notwith&s;tanding they be &s;ubiect to the crowne of England) do neither know what England or an Engli&s;h man doth meane: For an Engli&s;h man they call <HI>Sais,</HI> (but in the plurall number &s;peaking of more than one, <HI>Sai&s;&s;on</HI>) and this their natiue countrey they name <HI>Mon.</HI> Moreouer, that faire citie built vpon that arme of the &s;ea or frith, aboue mentioned, on the o|ther &s;ide ouer again&s;t the We&s;t part of this iland, is called <HI>Caeraruon,</HI> that is, The citie vpon Mon: For Caer, in our language &s;ignifieth a walled towne; (<HI>Kir,</HI> in Hebrew is a wall, and <HI>Kartha,</HI> in tho&s;e Ea&s;terne tongues is a walled citie:) <HI>Ar,</HI> is as much to &s;ay, as Vpon: and as for the <HI>v,</HI> in the la&s;t &s;yllable, for <HI>m,</HI> that is the pro|prietie of the language in &s;ome ca&s;es: for in all words beginning with <HI>m,</HI> in con&s;equence of &s;peech, that let|ter, after &s;ome certeine con&s;onants is changed into <HI>v,</HI> for which our nation doth alwayes v&s;e <HI>f:</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>v,</HI> with them is euermore a vowell: So we call Wedne&s;day <HI>(Diem Mercurij) Die Mercher,</HI> but Wedne&s;day night <HI>Nos Fercher.</HI> Mary, we call <HI>Mair;</HI> but for our Ladies church we write and pronounce <HI>Lhanuair.</HI> Nei|ther is this citie only thus named, but euen that whole tract of the continent of Britaine that runneth along by it is called <HI>Aruon,</HI> that is, Oppo&s;ite or ouer again&s;t Mon. But let it be, that this iland was not that Mona &s;o oft mentioned by the ancients, then ought Polydore for his credits &s;ake haue found another name for it, and not to haue left it wholly namele&s;&s;e. Now let vs come vnto the other, which our countreymen do call MENAW: and which all the inhabitants generall, as al&s;o the Engli&s;h and Scots (reteining the Wel&s;h name, but cutting it &s;omewhat &s;horter) MAN. Therefore there is no man, for ought I know, be&s;ide this proud Italian, and one Hector Bo&euml;thius, a loud liar, that euer called this iland by the name of Mona. But leauing the&s;e demon&s;trable arguments, which indeed do make this matter more cleere than the noone day, let vs come vnto authorities and te&s;timonies of learned men, which in &s;ome ca&s;es are rather beleeued than any o|ther arguments what&s;oeuer: by the&s;e I doubt not but the true and proper name &s;hall be giuen to ech of the&s;e ilands, and the controuer&s;ie decided without any maner of contradiction. There is a piece of Gildas Britannus, that ancient writer, a man euery kinde of way learned, at this day remaining, in the Librarie of the illu&s;trious Earle of Arundell, the only learned Noble man of his time; in which he hath the&s;e wordes: England hath three ilands belonging to it: Wight, ouer again&s;t the Armoricanes, or Bretaigne in France: The &s;econd lieth in the midde&s;t of the &s;ea betweene Ireland and England. The Latine Hi&s;torians doe call it <HI>Eubonia,</HI> but vulgarly in our mother tongue we call it MANAW. Thou heare&s;t, gentle Reader, a natu|rall Wel&s;h man &s;peaking in the Wel&s;h tongue: For thus we call Polydore Virgils Mona in our natiue lan|guage euen at this day. Moreouer, the reuerend Beda, that worthy Engli&s;hman, famous thorow all Chri|&s;tendome in his dayes for all maner of literature and good learning, in the ninth chapter of the &s;econd booke of his Hi&s;torie writeth thus: At which time al&s;o the people of Northumberland <HI>(Nordan Humbri)</HI> that is, all that nation of the Angles which did inhabit vpon the North &s;ide of the riuer Humber, with Ed|win their king, by the preaching of Paulinus (of whom we haue &s;poken a little before) was conuerted vnto
<PB REF="341"> the faith of Chri&s;t. This king in taking of good &s;ucce&s;&s;e for his enterteinment of the Go&s;pel, did grow &s;o mightie in Chri&s;tianitie and the kingdome of heauen, and al&s;o had that command vpon the earth, that he ruled (which neuer any king of the Engli&s;h did before him) from one end of Britaine to the other, and was king not only of the Engli&s;h but al&s;o of all the &s;hires and prouinces of the Britons. Yea and he brought vn|der his &s;ubiection, as I haue &s;hewed before, the iles of Man <HI>(in&s;ulae Menaniae.)</HI> Here I do thinke, that for <HI>Me|nauiae,</HI> it ought to be written <HI>Menauiae:</HI> &s;eeing that there is &s;uch &s;mall difference betweene an <HI>n</HI> and a <HI>u,</HI> that they may ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken, and one put for another. Moreouer, Henry Archdeacon of Huntingdon, a worthy Hi&s;toriographer, who wrote about the yeere of our Lord 1140, one that followed Beda in many things almo&s;t foot for foot, doth &s;eeme al&s;o to correct this fault, and cleere the doubt. For he &s;etting forth the great command and conque&s;ts of this Edwine King of the Northumbers, bru&s;teth out into the&s;e words: Eduwyn the king of the Northumbers ruled ouer all Britaine, not only ouer that part which was inhabited of the Engli&s;h, but ouer that al&s;o which was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Britons, Kent only excepted. More|ouer, he brought the ile <HI>Menauia,</HI> which lieth between Ireland and Britaine, and is commonly called MAN, vnder the obedience of the Kings of England. Here ob&s;erue, that this Engli&s;h man did giue al&s;o to this i|land (which Polydore Virgil fal&s;ly calleth Mona) the Engli&s;h name: for it is commonly, &s;ayth he, called <HI>Man:</HI> by which name it is knowen &amp; called at this day of all the Engli&s;h. Be&s;ides this al&s;o Ranulph of Che|&s;ter in the foure and fortieth chapter of the fir&s;t booke of his Polychronicon, doth thus &s;peake of tho&s;e i|lands which are neere neighbours vnto Britaine: Britaine, &s;ayth he, hath three ilands lying not farre off from it (be&s;ide the Orkney iles) which doe &s;eeme to an&s;wer vnto the three principall parts of the &s;ame: For WIGHT lieth hard vpon the coa&s;t of <HI>Lo&euml;gria,</HI> which now is called England <HI>(Anglia:)</HI> MONA which the Engli&s;h call Angli&s;ea, perteineth vnto <HI>Cambria,</HI> that is, to Wales: But the ile EVBONIA, which hath two other names, <HI>Menauia</HI> and <HI>Mania,</HI> lieth oueragain&s;t Scotland. The&s;e three, Wight, Man, and Angli&s;ea <HI>(Vecta, Mania, Mona)</HI> are almo&s;t all of one bigne&s;&s;e, and conteining the like quantitie of ground. Thus farre Ranulph of Che&s;ter. The rea&s;on why Gildas and others haue called this iland <HI>Eubonia,</HI> I take to be this; becau&s;e it was fir&s;t inhabited of the &s;ame nation (to wit, the Iri&s;h) of the which the <HI>Euboniae,</HI> the We&s;t iles, commonly of the Hi&s;torians called <HI>Hebrides,</HI> are. The reuerend Beda and Henry Huntington, in that they write it <HI>Menauia,</HI> do &s;eeme to allude to the Wel&s;h name <HI>Manaw:</HI> but this is it which we would haue thee di|ligently to ob&s;erue, that none of them do call it Mona. By the&s;e arguments and te&s;timonies it is manife&s;t that <HI>Mona</HI> is that iland which the inhabitants (as I haue &s;hewed before) doe at this day name <HI>Mona,</HI> or Mon, acknowledging no other name, and is that which of the Engli&s;h is called Angli&s;ea: but the other, which Polydore Virgil, and &s;uch as doe loue with him to wallow in the mire, rather than to &s;eeke for the cleere &s;treames, doe call Mona, is of Gildas called <HI>Eubonia,</HI> of Henry Huntington <HI>Menauia,</HI> and of others <HI>Mania.</HI> Here I will conclude this di&s;cour&s;e with this one te&s;timonie, which may indeed woorthily &s;tand for many; to wit, this of Sylue&s;ter Girald a Wel&s;h man borne, a man no le&s;&s;e famous for his learning, than for his no|ble birth: For he was de&s;cended from that noble hou&s;e of the Giralds, to whom the Kings of England are beholding for that footing which they haue in Ireland. Moreouer, he was greatly beloued of Henrie the &s;econd King of England, and was afterward Secretarie to King Iohn his &s;onne; who&s;e name al&s;o is very fa|mous and oft mentioned in the Popes Decretals: For being but bi&s;hop of S. Dauids in Wales, he did not|with&s;tanding contend with the Archbi&s;hop of Canturburie about the prerogatiue &amp; primacy: This man, I &s;ay, in that his booke which he intituled <HI>Itinerarium Balwini Archiepi&s;copi Cantuarien&s;is, crucem in infideles per Cam|briam praedicantis,</HI> The Iournall or trauels of Baldwin Archbi&s;hop of Canturbury, when as he preached the Go&s;pell and cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t again&s;t the Infidels thorowout all Wales (who&s;e company he neuer for&s;ooke in all that peregrination) writeth thus of the ile MONA. On the morrow we pa&s;&s;ed by the ca&s;tle of Caer|aruon, and from thence thorow the valleys and &s;teepe hilles and mountaines we came vnto Bangor, where we were mo&s;t kindly enterteined of the bi&s;hop (who&s;e name was Gwian, who was almo&s;t con&s;trained to take vp the cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t) with a great lamentation and &s;hout of all &s;orts of people both men and wo|men. From thence, cro&s;sing a vety narrow arme of the &s;ea, we pa&s;&s;ed ouer to MONA, an iland lying a|bout two miles off from the maine land. Here Rothericke the yonger &s;onne of Owen came very deuout|ly with all the people of that ile and of the countreys round about him, to meet vs. There they making as it were a theater of the craggie rocks, by the preaching of the Archbi&s;hop, and of Alexander the Archdea|con of that place, many were wonne vnto the cro&s;&s;e and to beleeue in Ie&s;us Chri&s;t, but certeine yong men, lu&s;tie-bloods, of the &s;eruants and followers of Rothericke, which &s;ate oueragain&s;t vs, would by no meanes be drawen to beare the cro&s;&s;e. Of the&s;e &s;ome, within a little while after, following certeine theeues or free-booters, being &s;laine outright, others hurt and dangerou&s;ly wounded, did of their owne heads lay a world|ly cro&s;&s;e one vpon anothers backe. Rothericke was married to Prince Ree&s;e's daughter, who was allied to him in the third degree: her, by no admonitions, he could be made to put away from him, hoping that by her meanes he &s;hould the better be able to defend him&s;elfe again&s;t his brothers children, whom he had di&s;herited and put by their lands and po&s;&s;e&s;sions: notwith&s;tanding it fell out contrary to his expectation, for within awhile after they recouered all againe out of his hands. This Iland hath three hundred three and fortie villages or farmes, yet it is e&s;teemed but at three Cantreds. Britaine hath three ilands lying not farre off from it, all almo&s;t of like quantitie and bigne&s;&s;e: <HI>VVight,</HI> vpon the South; <HI>Mon,</HI> vpon the We&s;t;
<PB REF="342"> and <HI>Man,</HI> vpon the Northwe&s;t. The two former are very neere to the continent, the armes of the &s;ea by which they are &s;euered from England, being but very narrow and not farre ouer. The third which is called Man, lieth mid way betweene Vl&s;ter, a prouince of Ireland, and Gallawey of Scotland. Mona, or Mon, of the inhabitants, by rea&s;on of the great plenty of wheat which it yeeldeth ordinarily euery yeere, is called The mother of Wales. And a little beneath, the &s;ame Authour writeth thus of this iland: Hugh Earle of Shrewsbury and Arundell, with Hugh Earle of Che&s;ter, entring this iland by force, did &s;hut dogs all night in the church of Fefridanke, which the next morning were found all &s;tarke madde; and he him&s;elfe after|ward by the inhabitants of the Orkeney iles, comming thither as pirats and &s;ea-robbers, vnder the leading of Magnus their captaine, being &s;hot in the eye (which part of his body only was vnarmed and &s;ubiect to the enemies weapon) fell &s;tone dead from the decke of the &s;hippe into the &s;ea: which Magnus beholding, cried out in the Dani&s;h language, <HI>Leit loope,</HI> that is as much to &s;ay in Engli&s;h, Let him leape. Moreouer, Henry the Second, going into North-Wales with an armie of men, ioyned battell with the aduer&s;arie at Cale&s;hull in a narrow &s;traight betweene two woods, and withall &s;ent a &s;aile of &s;hips into Mona, which &s;poi|led the fore&s;ayd Church with other places there: wherfore they were almo&s;t all &s;laine, taken, dangerou&s;ly wounded, or put to flight by the inhabitants of that ile. There were in this company two noble men, and his vncle which wrote this &s;tory, with other mo &s;ent hither by the King, to wit, Henry the &s;onne of Henry the Fir&s;t, and the vncle of Henry the Second, begotten of the honourable lady Ne&s;ta, daughter of Ree&s;e, Theodore's &s;onne, borne in the confines of South-Wales, I meane in the skirts of it next vnto Deme|tia or We&s;t-Wales, and the brother of Steuen, brother to Henry by the mothers &s;ide, but not by the fa|thers, a man that fir&s;t in our dayes, breaking the way for others, not long after this, attempted the entrance and conque&s;t of Ireland, who&s;e worthy commendations the prophicall hi&s;tory doth at large &s;et foorth. Henry being too venturous, and not being &s;econded in time, was killed at the fir&s;t encounter with a pike. But Robert di&s;tru&s;ting his owne &s;trength and doubting whether he &s;hould be aided or not, fled, and being &s;ore wounded, very hardly recouered the &s;hippes. This iland outwardly appeareth as if it were barren, rough, and ouergrowen, like as the countrey of Pebidion neere Menauia doth, although indeed it be very fertile of many things in diuers places. Thus farre Gyraldus. What could euer be &s;poken or written more plainly and euidently of the name, &s;ituation, fertility and valourous inhabitants of Mona; as al&s;o of the &s;i|tuation and name of that other iland? The &s;ame authour in his de&s;cription of Wales, thus &s;peaketh of this Iland: In North-Wales betweene Mona and Snowdon hilles is Bangor the bi&s;hops &s;ea. As of all Wales, the South part about Cardigan &s;hire, (<HI>Cereticam regionem,</HI> he calleth it) but e&s;pecially euery where in We&s;t-Wales, <HI>(Demetia)</HI> by rea&s;on of the champion plaines, and commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the marine coa&s;ts, are farre the more plea&s;ant and better: &s;o North-Wales <HI>(Borealis Venedotia)</HI> is knowen to haue many countries and places farre more &s;trong and better fortified by nature and &s;ituation, many more goodly braue men, euerie where to haue much better and more fertile ground: For like as Snowdon hilles are thought to be able to finde pa&s;ture for all the cattell in Wales if they were all driuen thither, &s;o it is reported that the ile Mona <HI>(Angli&s;ea)</HI> may for a time finde all Wales bread-corne; &s;uch is the woonderfull &s;tore of wheat that it doth yeerely yeeld. What man is he that is &s;o blocki&s;h and void of vnder&s;tanding, that &s;hall read and con&s;ider the&s;e arguments and allegations, that will make any doubt whether Polydore's Angli&s;ea be the true Mona, that ancient &s;eat of the Druides, &s;o renowmed by the Romane warres, and oft mentioned in their hi&s;tories? Moreouer, who can doubt, whether that other Iland, which the Wel&s;hmen call <HI>Manaw,</HI> and the Engli&s;h <HI>Man,</HI> which he and &s;ome other learned men (chu&s;ing rather to drinke puddle water from a neere channell, than to &s;eeke farther for a cleere &s;treame or pure fountaine) haue fal&s;ly named <HI>Mona,</HI> or whether we ought not rather with Ptolemey to call it <HI>Monaria,</HI> or <HI>Monaida; Eubonia,</HI> with Gildas; <HI>Menauia,</HI> with Beda and Henrie Huntington; or <HI>Mania,</HI> with Gyraldus?</P>
<P>Many more arguments and te&s;timonies of learned men I could in this place haue alleaged: but le&s;t I &s;hould be too tedious and trouble&s;ome to the Reader, I will at this time with the&s;e content my &s;elfe: no|thing doubting but the&s;e, to any learned man, or any one well acquainted with the Wel&s;h hi&s;tories, &s;halbe thought &s;ufficient to &s;top the mouth of the &s;candalous aduer&s;ary, and to an&s;wer all the cauils of the maliti|ous enuiours of the Britons glory. Therefore I mu&s;t entreat thee, mo&s;t learned Ortell, for that thy kind|ne&s;&s;e and humanity which thou art wont to &s;hew to others, to take this in good part, and in that thy good|ly Theater, to &s;et out this our Mona, in the ancient colours, to the publicke view of the world: And I hope before it be long to &s;end you a more ab&s;olute de&s;cription, not only of this our Mona, but al&s;o of all Wales, illu&s;trated both with the ancient names v&s;ed by the Romans and Britons, and al&s;o with the moderne Eng|li&s;h, whereby they are knowen at this day of that nation. Moreouer, I haue a Geographicall Chart or Map of England, de&s;cribed according to the moderne &s;ituation and view, with the ancient names of riuers, townes, people and places, mentioned by Ptolemey, Pliny, Antonine and others, that tho&s;e gro&s;&s;e and &s;hamele&s;&s;e lies of Hector Boothe may by that means the ea&s;ilier be de&s;cried: again&s;t which Hector Boothe our Leland, that famous and learned Antiquary wrote this mo&s;t worthy Epigramme: <HI>Hectoris hi&s;torici tot, quot mendacia &s;crip&s;it, Si vis vt numerem, Lector amice, tibi; Me iubeas etiam fluctus numerare marinos, Et liquidi &s;tellas connumerare poli. Would'st haue me, gentle Reader, tell I he lies that Hector Boothe did write? I may a&s;well count &s;and of &s;ea, Or &s;tarres of heauen in cleere&s;t night.</HI> I haue al&s;o a very exact de&s;cription of the marine tract or &s;ea coa&s;t of Scot|land:
<PB REF="342"> all which when I &s;hall come vp to London (which God willing &s;hall be before the end of April next) I will &s;end vnto you: Whereby the manife&s;t and palpable errours of certeine learned men &s;hall be di&s;coue|red: who in their Geographicall Chart, tru&s;ting too confidently to certeine vnlearned mens relations and writings haue mo&s;t fal&s;ly and erroneou&s;ly &s;et downe the names of diuers places, cities and riuers, to the great preiudice and danger of &s;uch as &s;hall giue heed vnto them. In the meane time I bid you heartily farewell, be&s;eeching you, of all loues, if there be any thing wherein I may plea&s;ure you, not to entreat it, but to command it, by the law of friend&s;hip and league of lear|ned &s;cholars. Richard Clough, a verie hone&s;t man, and one that was the cau&s;e and procurer of this our loue and acquaintance, a&s;well your friend as mine, &s;hall both bring your letters from you to me, and mine to you, that intere&s;t I know we both haue in him. Againe farewell, mo&s;t kinde ORTELL: from <HI>Denbigh</HI> in <HI>Guynedh</HI> or North-Wales this fifth of April, in the yeere of our Lord God M.D.LXVIII.</P>
