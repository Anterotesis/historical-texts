<OPENER><DATELINE>From on Board the <HI>Hannibal,</HI> <DATE>Aug. 14. 1689.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN continuance of my Advice, the&s;e are to in|form you, That on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 3^d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> we weighed at three in the morning, and &s;tood out from <HI>Ou&s;ely</HI> Bay, the Wind we&s;terly. About Ten we got into the <HI>Downs;</HI> and di&s;covered on to the Leeward, the <HI>High-Land</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Good|win.</HI> About Two in the afternoon we came to an Anchor before <HI>Deal,</HI> where we di&s;covered off of the Foreland two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, which appear'd to be &s;ome that went before, and promis'd to meet us in <HI>Dover</HI> Road. The Captain of one of them came aboard about Three, and brought us News that a little Dutch Pri|vateer had that &s;ame week brought Eleven Prizes into this place; &s;ome pretended Hamburgers, one Iri&s;h, but all freighted with French Goods.</P>
<P>About Five the Pur&s;er went a&s;hore for fre&s;h pro|vi&s;ions. The Captain intended to &s;ail again the &s;ame night for <HI>Dover,</HI> and toward the <HI>I&s;le of Wight:</HI> He fired the Gun accordingly, preparing to &s;tand away, &s;everal of the Fleet being already under &s;ail. But while we &s;taid for the Pur&s;er, the Wind chopt about more to the we&s;terly; on which he chang'd his Re&s;olution, and moor'd in <HI>Deal</HI> Road.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> the 4th. the Wind continued &s;till at the &s;ame points, or rather came about more &s;outherly: So we were forc'd to &s;tay here all day.</P>
<P>After Evening Service, came up the brave Captain <HI>Pottinger,</HI> in his little <HI>Fantau,</HI> which we &s;o long want|ed; who came aboard us, and gave us an account that the <HI>Dragon</HI> Sloop lies yet about <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> or the <HI>Hope,</HI> and &s;tays for Orders.</P>
<P>Here we fir&s;t heard the News that the <HI>Toulon</HI> Squa|dron of French Men of War was got into <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> And the pretty pa&s;&s;age of the great <HI>Galeon,</HI> one of the riche&s;t Laden of all the Spani&s;h Fleet, then homeward bound, which being &s;eparated from the re&s;t, put into a little Creek ju&s;t at that In&s;tant that the French went by; and being ju&s;t got in, di&s;covered them; on which, you'll believe, &s;he lay very clo&s;e, till they all pa&s;t by without &s;eeing her, and &s;o the prey got out of their clutches, and they got &s;afe into their own Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> morning <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5. at Two a Clock, we had a fair Ea&s;terly Wind came up, with which we &s;et &s;ail from the Downs.</P>
<P>We hear here we are de&s;ign'd, after we get to our Port at <HI>High-Lake</HI> by <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> for <HI>Loughfoyl</HI> and <HI>Lon|don Derry;</HI> whence I hope to give you an account of more material pa&s;&s;ages, our Men being all as re&s;olv'd and chearful as &s;o good a Cau&s;e can make 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t 14. High-Lake</HI> near <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, You had heard &s;ooner from me according to promi&s;e, but that we toucht no where after we left <HI>Deal,</HI> till we came to an Anchor at our Port of <HI>High-Lake,</HI> and the Boat went away before I had fini&s;hed my la&s;t; &s;o you've now two together.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 5. As I told you in my la&s;t, we &s;et &s;ail from the <HI>Downs</HI> about Two in the morning, but after Din|ner, the Wind &s;lackning, we were almo&s;t becalm'd, and &s;o came to an Anchor in <HI>Dover</HI> Road over again&s;t <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Between 3 and 4 we &s;aw a Gale coming; &s;o weigh'd again, and by 8 in the morning <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 6. rais'd the I&s;le of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>About the &s;ame time we &s;aw a Sail toward the Coa&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ent off the <HI>Navy</HI> Yacht, one of our Hoys, and the <HI>Fantau</HI> to &s;peak with her, who about 10 came up with her, and found her an O&s;tender, but loaden from <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> for <HI>Bruges</HI> with French Wines &amp; Brandy: They had been taken &s;ome days before off of the Lands end by a Dutch Privateer, who had put Four or Five of their Men aboard her. However, not knowing but 'twas a trick to get from us, we kept 'em till we came over again&s;t <HI>Plymouth,</HI> where meeting the
<PB REF="2"> Privateer who took 'em, and they confirming what had before been &s;aid, we turn'd her off <HI>for Plymouth,</HI> having before taken her in a Tow; but this happen|ed not till <HI>Friday Augu&s;t</HI> the 9th.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day Augu&s;t</HI> 7. We rais'd the Beak of <HI>Port|land,</HI> and the Shores of <HI>Dort&s;et&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> morning. <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 8. About 4 in the morning we &s;aw two Sail to the Leeward and &s;u&s;|pected 'em French-men, they &s;till keeping off, and having no Colours out. About 7 Captain <HI>Pottinger,</HI> and Captain <HI>Pet.</HI> of the Navy Yacht came aboard, having the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions. At 8 we &s;pread our Colours on our Ancient Staff, and they not an&s;wering with theirs, we concluded without more adoe they were Enemies. We &s;aw they were men of War, and Stout Ships &s;o prepared for an engagement in earne&s;t. We gave the &s;ignal, and the Commanders came a|board. We &s;tay'd our Cabins, cut down our Ham|macks, heav'd Che&s;ts over board, and the Seamen made all ready with the greate&s;t briskne&s;s and courage imaginable. And after having cleared our Ship, &s;hot|ted all our Guns, nail'd down our Hatches, and done what's u&s;ual in &s;uch ca&s;es, bore up towards &s;ome of our Fleet, who were run a head of us, and being with|out defence, would &s;oon fall into the Enemies mouth. We ha&s;t ju&s;t got up our &s;mall Arms, and every man to his Quarter, bearing away to 'em as fa&s;t as all the Sail we could make wou'd carry us when they both lowr'd their Top-Sails, and put out Orange Colours on which our Seamen were all very Melancholy having lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a fair occa&s;ion of trying their valour, when they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ought they were now &s;ure of it beyond di&s;ap|point<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">nt. This happened about &s;even or eighth Leagurd to the We&s;tward of <HI>Portland.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning we di&s;covered another Sail a great way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tern of us, after which we &s;ent two of our Catches&punc; but &s;he out-&s;ail'd 'em both, came under our Lee, and lowr'd her Top-Sail, but did not care to &s;peak with us&punc; On which we fir'd a Gun, and brought her under our Stern, with Trumpets &s;ounding and Drums beatin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Which we an&s;wered with what Mu|&s;ick we had when they came up with us, they appear|ed to be a D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 chunk"> Privateer, with fourteen Guns, and &s;ix Petereero <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 chunk">d eighty two men. They gave us three Guns and a cheer which we returned, and &s;o parted they told us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">y were bound for <HI>the Sea,</HI> which was all the acco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> we could get of 'em.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">orning. <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 10. One of our Catches took a &s;mall Boat bound from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Galloway</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> loaden with Salt. He had been taken by the &s;ame Flu&s;hinger we met on <HI>Thur&s;day,</HI> who had taken the fir&s;t, who had al&s;o &s;ome men aboard her. There were in her <HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> (I think her Ma&s;ter) told us that he came from before <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> &s;ome few days pa&s;t, where he &s;aw the <HI>French</HI> Fleet ready to leave it, about twenty already being got out of the Harbour: And &s;ay they were about &s;eventy Sail. We let him go again, and doubled&punc; the Lizzard point, and got into <HI>Mountsbay,</HI> and di&s;covered the Mount about twelve at Noon.</P>
<P>In the afternoon as well as all the day before we heard &s;everal Broad-&s;ides, and a great many hundred Guns to the Coa&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> About four a Clock we heard a great blow the &s;ame way, and immediately after &s;aw a huge Pile of &s;moak ri&s;e from the place where we heard the blow. This was &s;een by mo&s;t of our Fleet, and is concluded &s;ome Ship or other blown up.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Monday</HI> we made the be&s;t of our way towards our Port, with fair Winds, and fine Weather.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> in the afternoon, about 3 a Clock, we &s;aw the <HI>Welch Land,</HI> and two &s;trange Ships ahead of us; on which we tackt, for the re&s;t of our Fleet, and to get the Weathergage. About 6 we came up with 'em, and found 'em a Yacht and a Smack, who confirm'd the happy News we heard from <HI>Weymouth,</HI> of the Relief of <HI>Derry:</HI> They al&s;o told that Admiral <HI>Herbert</HI> and our Fleet, about Eighty Sail, were of off the old Head of <HI>King&s;ale,</HI> whence they lately came, and were now again going to 'em.</P>
<P>In the evening we came up with &s;ome little I&s;lands; and about 12 at night pa&s;t the Bi&s;hop and his Clerks, without any of all tho&s;e Bugbears <HI>Hickeringall</HI> talks of. We found 'em very peaceable Rocks; they let us all go by without touching us, though had we had a fancy to try hard-heads with 'em, 'tis ten to one we had got the wor&s;t on 't.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> we &s;aw <HI>Bardley</HI> I&s;land, and the main Land of <HI>Wales,</HI> and a parcel of Mountains, one would think high enough to break the Goats necks that clamber to the tops of 'em. In the evening we came up with <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> whither in the night mo&s;t of our Fleet &s;tole away from us, and got to an Anchor in <HI>Beaumarys</HI> Bay.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> 14. We took a Pilot on board, got round the Sand-bank, and came to an Anchor in our Port of <HI>High-Lake.</HI> In working our Ship about to get her into the Harbour, the Wind being &s;omewhat again&s;t us, one of our Men was beaten again&s;t the &s;ides of the Ship with a Rope, and taken up for dead, but he recovered, and is like to do well; all the misfortunes we yet met with in our Voyage.</P>
<P>They tell us here that Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> went off for <HI>Ireland</HI> with a fair wind, on <HI>Munday</HI> la&s;t, with about 13000 men, and the re&s;t we find Shipping to follow him as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. There is now with us at <HI>High|lake</HI> the <HI>Dartmouth</HI> Frigot, which fired again&s;t <HI>Kilmore,</HI> while relief went into <HI>Derry,</HI> there is upon the &s;hore ju&s;t ready to embark for <HI>Ireland</HI> my Lord <HI>Lucas</HI> his Regiment, and other Soldiers.</P>
