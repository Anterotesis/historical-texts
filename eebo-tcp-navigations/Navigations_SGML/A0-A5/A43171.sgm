<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEING A PERFECT RELATION OF THE Late Di&s;covery, and Wonderful Di&s;-inchant|ment of an I&s;land on the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Have received yours of the 12th of <HI>February,</HI> and the Printed Re|lation of the certain Death of that Arch-Pirate Captain <HI>Cu&s;acke;</HI> of who&s;e Death, all our Mer|chants here in <HI>Ireland,</HI> are very glad; e&s;pecially my Cou&s;in <HI>Mat|thew Calhoon,</HI> from whom, <HI>Cu&s;acke</HI> took the la&s;t Ve&s;|&s;el; which, it &s;eems, brought him to his de&s;erved fa|tal end. And in requital of your News concerning <HI>Cu&s;acke,</HI> I &s;hall acquaint you with a Story no le&s;s true; but I believe much more &s;trange and wonderful, con|cerning the Di&s;covery of that long-talk't-of I&s;land <HI>O-Brazile,</HI> which (I believe) you have often heard of.</P>
<P>I know there are, in the World, many Stories, and Romances, concerning Inchanted I&s;lands, Ca&s;tles and
<PB N="4" REF="3">Towers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that our King's Dominions may in nothing be inferiour to any other Nation, we have had an Inchanted I&s;land, upon the North of <HI>Ireland,</HI> long talkt of. And, indeed, when I went fir&s;t into the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland</HI> to live, and heard tho&s;e many Stories, which were common in every Mans mouth, concerning the I&s;land of <HI>O-Brazile,</HI> (as they call'd it) which multitudes reported often to be &s;een upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>&V;i&s;ter</HI> in that Kingdom; yet I lookt up|on it as a perfect Romance, and many times laught the Reporters to &s;corn: Though many Sober, and Religious per&s;ons, would con&s;tantly affirm, That in bright days, (e&s;pecially in Summer-time) they could perfectly &s;ee a very large ab&s;olute I&s;land; but, after long looking at it, it would di&s;appear. And &s;ome|times one Friend and Neighbor, would one call an|other to behold it, until there would be a con&s;idera|ble Number together; every of which, would not be per&s;uaded but that they perfectly &s;aw it: and &s;ome of them, have made towards it with Boats; but when they have come to the place where they thought it was, they have found nothing. And many old Peo|ple in the Countrey, would tell many old probable Stories, how it came fir&s;t to be Inchanted. I confe&s;s there were (in tho&s;e days) two things made me a little to wonder:</P>
<P N="1">1. How it came to be in&s;erted into many of our both Ancient and Modern Maps, (as you, or any Man may find it is) by the name of <HI>O-Brazile.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The other is, What moved your Cou&s;in, (that, you know, dyed but within the&s;e four or five years at <HI>Gla&s;s-lough</HI>) who was a wi&s;e Man, and a great Scholar, to put him&s;elf to the charges and trouble,
<PB N="5" REF="3">(in the late King's time) to take out a Patent for it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>There is nothing more certain, than that a Patent was taken out for it in the late King's dayes.</HI></NOTE> when&s;oever it &s;hould be gained: Certainly he, and tho&s;e that coun&s;elled him to it, lookt upon it, as &s;ome Inchanted (if any &s;uch thing there be) Kingdom or I&s;land, that, in time, might be recovered. And &s;ince the Happy Re&s;tauration of His Maje&s;ty that now Reigns, many Reports have been, That it hath been Di&s;-inchanted, or Taken. Yea, in the time of the Sitting of the la&s;t Parliament in <HI>Dublin,</HI> (in the year 1663.) one coming out of <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;e of Commons, (whereof he was a Member) That the Inchantment was broken, and it gained: but it proved not &s;o. And about two years after, a certain Quaker pretended that he had a Revelation from Heaven, that he was the Man ordained to take it, with a new Ship built by his In&s;piration, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And in order thereunto, he built a Ve&s;&s;el. But what became of him, or his En|terprize, I never heard; it &s;eems the full time was not then come. I a&s;&s;ure you (dear Cou&s;in) I was not then &s;o unwilling to believe it, as now I am certain of it, from very good hands. But whether (in the Ori|ginal) it have been a Trick of <HI>Rome,</HI> one of the Works and My&s;teries of <HI>Babylon,</HI> I cannot &s;ay, neither dare I di&s;pute: But this I am &s;ure of, That the Time, or Inchantment, (or what you plea&s;e to call it) is now out, and the I&s;land fully di&s;covered, or taken, And the manner, briefly, thus:</P>
<P>There is one Captain <HI>John Nisbet,</HI> who lived formerly at <HI>Li&s;neskey</HI> in the County of <HI>Fermanagh;</HI> this Man left <HI>Li&s;neskey</HI> &s;even or eight years &s;ince, and came to live at <HI>Killebegs</HI> in the Barony of <HI>Boylagh</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="4"><HI>Bannagh,</HI> in the County of <HI>Dunnegall,</HI> in <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> (a Cor|poration you know right well.) This Man, Captain <HI>Nisbet,</HI> &s;ince he came to <HI>Killebegs,</HI> hath fraught out &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> &amp;c. with &s;uch Merchandize as that Countrey afforded. And in <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, he fraught out a Ve&s;&s;el of about 70 Tuns, laden with Butter, Tallow, and Hydes, for <HI>France,</HI> which was to bring back French Wines. Which Ve&s;&s;el being returning, and near the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Ireland</HI> (as they thought) upon the &s;econd of this in&s;tant <HI>March,</HI> 1674. after a mo&s;t clear fro&s;ty Night, in the Morning about the time of Sun-ri&s;ing, of a &s;udden, there fell a mo&s;t terrible thick Mi&s;t or Fog, upon the Sea round about them; which continued the &s;pace of about three hours and then cleared up again, very bright. But when the Mi&s;t was vani&s;ht, they found them&s;elves upon a certain Coa&s;t, clo&s;e by the &s;hore; and of a &s;udden al&s;o, a very high wind, driving them &s;till nearer to the Land. When the Ma&s;ter, and the re&s;t with him (who were but eight per&s;ons in all, <HI>viz. James mac Donnel</HI> the Ma&s;ter, <HI>Alexander John&s;on</HI> Skipper, <HI>James Ro&s;s</HI> Carpenter, and five Mariners) &s;aw them&s;elves &s;o near an unknown &s;hore, and could not imagine what place it &s;hould be; for though they knew mo&s;t of the &s;hores of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet they could not po&s;&s;ibly give any gue&s;s where they then were. Finding them&s;elves therefore &s;o near Land, and &s;ome little Rocks not far off them, the Ma&s;ter gave orders to &s;ound what Wa|ter they had; and finding it not three Fathoms, they thought it was the be&s;t cour&s;e to &s;trike Sail, and drop an Anchor, (which accordingly they did) until they might inform them&s;elves where they were.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<P> And having ca&s;t Anchor, they re&s;olved to &s;et four of their eight Men a&s;hore, to &s;ee if they could learn where they were; and how to get off: which, after they had ta|ken down their Boat, they did. The Per&s;ons that were to goe were the Carpenter <HI>James Ro&s;s,</HI> and three Marriners, who took with them Swords and Pi&s;tols. Pre&s;ently af|ter Landing, they pa&s;t through a little Wood, and with|in le&s;s than an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile, in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant green Val|ley (wherein were many Cattel, Hor&s;es and Sheep feeding) they &s;aw a very &s;trong-like Ca&s;tle appearing, unto which they repaired, and called, thinking to find &s;ome that might direct them where they were, and what to do: but after they had long knockt, and &s;aw, nor heard any creature, (not &s;o much as a Dog) an&s;wer, they concluded it was &s;ome wa&s;te place, and therefore left it. And go|ing farther up a mo&s;t plea&s;ant green Hill, they &s;aw multitudes of black Rabbets, about a mile from the Ca&s;tle: but when they came to the height thereof, look which way they plea&s;ed, they could &s;ee neither Man, Woman, Child, nor Hou&s;e. At la&s;t, having ranged 2 or 3 hours about the Countrey, and lighting of none to enquire of, they returned again to their Boat, and told their fellows aboard, what &s;ucce&s;s they had had; whereupon their fellows calling for the Boat, re&s;olved to come a&s;hore al&s;o, all but one Mariner; which they did, and dividing them&s;elves into two parts, one part took to the right-hand &s;hore, the other to the left; both parties wandring up and down, until toward 4 of the clock in the afternoon, but neither of them &s;aw any people to enquire of; but much Cattel, Dear, Rabbets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But afar off in the Countrey, they &s;aw great Woods, into which they dur&s;t not venture: &s;o that both parties re|turned again to their Boat, At la&s;t the weather being ve|ry
<PB N="8" REF="5">cold, and drawing towards night, finding abundance of old dry Wood, in the &s;ide of the above-named little Wood, near unto the &s;hore, they re&s;olved to make a great Fire, again&s;t a great old Oak, that was fallen down with age; and in order thereunto, &s;ome brought Wood, and &s;ome others &s;truck fire: at la&s;t, having made a row|zing Fire, and &s;itting warming them&s;elves, di&s;cour&s;ing, and taking Tobacco; of a &s;uddain they heard a mo&s;t ter|rible, hideous noi&s;e, towards that place; e&s;pecially where they &s;aw the old Ca&s;tle, and almo&s;t all over the I&s;land, which did &s;o terrify and amaze them, that they pre&s;ent|ly left their Fire, took their Boat, and went all aboard as fa&s;t as they could; where they continued in great fear all night: yet neither could, nor dur&s;t &s;tir out to Sea; becau&s;e when they &s;ounded again, they had not two fa|thoms of Water, and the wind directly again&s;t them.</P>
<P>The next morning, as &s;oon as the Sun was ri&s;en, they &s;aw a very antient grave Gentleman, and ten Men fol|lowing him bare-headed (as if his &s;ervants) coming to|wards the &s;hore where the Ship lay, and being come clo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">o the water &s;ide, the old Gentleman calling to the Ma|&s;ter (in the old Scotch Language) who with the re&s;t &s;tood upon the Deck, askt him, from whence they came? whither they were bound? and with what they were laden? The Ma&s;ter an&s;wered, They came from <HI>France,</HI> were laden with <HI>French</HI> Wines, with which they were bound to <HI>Killy-beggs,</HI> in the County of <HI>Dunegall</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> if it plea&s;ed God to give them leave; then the old Gentleman askt them, how they came thither? and whether they knew where they were? or how to get forth? The Ma&s;ter told him, that before the great Fogg fell upon them ye&s;terday, they thought they were near the coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland:</HI> but where they now were, or how
<PB N="9" REF="5">to get off, he knew not in the lea&s;t, Then the grave Gentleman told them, if they would plea&s;e to come a&s;hore again, they &s;hould be courteou&s;ly entertained, told where they were, well rewarded, and guided to their own coa&s;t. Then the Ma&s;ter askt whether they &s;hould have no wrong or harm done to them&s;elves, nor Ve&s;&s;el, if they came a&s;hore? the old man promi&s;ed they &s;hould not: whereupon, the Ma&s;ter and the re&s;t, &s;eeing no Arms with them, re&s;olved, &s;ix of them &s;hould come a&s;hore, well armed.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oon as they were landed, the old Gentleman em|braced them one by one; telling them, they were the mo&s;t happy &s;ight that I&s;land had &s;een &s;ome hundred of years; that the I&s;land was called <HI>O Brazile;</HI> that his Ance&s;tors were &s;ometimes Princes of it; telling them al&s;o, that he and &s;everal other per&s;ons of quality, by the malicious, diabolical Art, of a great Negromancer, had been tyrannically &s;hut up in the Ca&s;tle they knockt at ye&s;terday, in which, &s;everal of their Progenitors had ended their mi&s;erable days; and the whole I&s;land, a Re|ceptacle of Furies, made (to Mortals) un&s;erviceable, and invi&s;ible, until now, that the cur&s;ed time was expired; which (&s;aith he) continued until the la&s;t day of the la&s;t month, but 3 or 4 days &s;ince. Being asked, why none an&s;wered in the Ca&s;tle ye&s;terday, when the Marriners knockt &s;o long? he an&s;wered, that though the wicked time was expired, and that now the I&s;land was vi&s;ible, and any might come upon it; yet he and the re&s;t had neither power to an&s;wer any that &s;poke to them, nor free them&s;elves from impri&s;onment, until Fire was kindled upon the I&s;land by &s;ome good Chri&s;tians. Be|ing askt, whether it was now ab&s;olutely free, and would never be inchanted again? he told them, it was now ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="10" REF="6">free; and &s;hould never be troubled again: but all the powers of darkne&s;s, when they heard that hideous noi&s;e, were finally departed.</P>
<P>After which words, he led them towards the &s;aid Ca|&s;tle; (the chief Tower being, as it were demoli&s;hed) where met them &s;everal other grave per&s;ons, both Men and Women: who all embraced the Ma&s;ter, and the re&s;t, giving them many thanks; then the other two were fetcht out of the Ve&s;&s;el, and all nobly Fea&s;ted, and Richly rewarded, and &s;hewed the Glory and Riches of the &s;aid I&s;land, which they &s;ay is above 60 miles in length, and above 30 in breadth; abounding with Hor&s;es, Cows, Sheep, Staggs, Rabbets, but no Swine, and all &s;orts of Fowls; and rich Mines of Silver and Gold, but few Peo|ple, and little or no Corn: there have been Cities and great Towns, but all con&s;umed.</P>
<P>The Men being richly rewarded, were conducted to their Ve&s;&s;el; and &s;hewed the way out of the Harbor, and directed the way to their own Coa&s;t; and came the next day at night to <HI>Killy-beggs,</HI> where they acquainted the Mini&s;ter of the Town, and many other per&s;ons of quality in the Countrey, who gave no extraordinary credit to their words at fir&s;t, until the Ma&s;ter and the re&s;t &s;hewed them many of the pieces of Gold and Silver, which were given them there, which were large, and of a mo&s;t antient &s;tamp, &s;omewhat ru&s;ty, yet pure Gold; the Ma|&s;ter al&s;o offering immediately, to carry any Gentlemen to the &s;aid I&s;land, that de&s;ired to know the further truth. Whereupon &s;ome Gentlemen of the Countrey, within three days after, &s;ent out another Ve&s;&s;el, and the above|named <HI>Alexander John&s;on,</HI> Skipper, and &s;ome of the for|mer Marriners to guide her, to prove whether it were true or no; who brought them to the &s;aid I&s;land; where
<PB N="11" REF="6">they were nobly entertained, and returned in &s;afety, with &s;everal Gifts, which were be&s;towed upon them: as al&s;o &s;ome further Relation of the nature of the Countrey. Since then, &s;everal Godly Mini&s;ters and others, are gone to vi&s;it, and di&s;cour&s;e them (but at the writing hereof, I heard nothing of their return) who, doubtle&s;s, will bring a more perfect relation. Dear Cou&s;en, you need not be afraid to relate this, for I a&s;&s;ure you, be&s;ide the general di&s;cour&s;e of the Gentlemen in the Countrey, I had it from Captain <HI>Ni&s;bet</HI> his own mouth, (who&s;e the Ve&s;|&s;el, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> was) &s;ince which, &s;everal Gentlemen have &s;ent an expre&s;s, with the true Relation of it, under their Hands and Seals, to &s;ome eminent per&s;ons in <HI>Dublin.</HI> Thus not troubling you any further at pre&s;ent, I re&s;t,</P>
