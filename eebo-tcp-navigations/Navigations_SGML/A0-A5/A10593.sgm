<P>TO declare to the World the hourely and minutely griefe of Con&s;cience and grieuances for the Religion which wee haue had, were almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible and al&s;o vnnece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince it is, alas, too well knowne to this Land, to the Em|pire, and to a great part of the World; yet ne|uerthele&s;&s;e we will rehear&s;e a few.</P>
<P N="1">1. Fir&s;t, by priuiledge, and good will of the illu&s;trious Arch-Duke <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> of famous memory, our gracious Lord and Prince, was granted to the profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pell, many &s;peciall Mini&s;ters in principall Townes as in <HI>Gratz, Indenburgk, Clagenfourt,</HI> and <HI>Labach.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Item,</HI> their Colledges and free Schooles of learning, for in&s;tructing Noblemens, and others Children, were admitted and granted them, in the fore&s;aid Townes of <HI>Gratz, Cla|genfourt,</HI> and <HI>Labach,</HI> all which priuiledges are mo&s;t violently taken from them.</P>
<P N="3"><PB REF="3">3. <HI>Item,</HI> in the Countrey of <HI>Stiria,</HI> were many Cathedrall and other Pari&s;h Churches al&s;o violently taken from them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Al&s;o many priuiledged Churches, pulled downe, and blowne vp with Gunpowder.</P>
<P N="5">5. One hundred Preachers and Mini&s;ters commanded vpon paine of death to depart the prouince of <HI>Stiria.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. A great many more Schoole-ma&s;ters, and Teachers of the Youth, mo&s;t pittifully bani&s;hed.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Item,</HI> many Church-yards, and re&s;ting places for the dead bodyes of the faithfull, being walled and paled about, were mo&s;t bar|barou&s;ly pulled downe, and made leuell with the ground.</P>
<P N="8">8. The bodies of the faithfull digged vp, and giuen to be deuoured by Dogs and Hogs; as al&s;o the Coffins taken and &s;et by the high|way &s;ide, &s;ome burnt with fire; a worke both barbarous and inhumane.</P>
<P N="9">9. Al&s;o vpon the buriall places of the faithfull, were erected Gibets and places for execution of malefactors. Al&s;o vpon tho&s;e places where Prote&s;tant Churches &s;tood, or where the Pulpit &s;tood, or the Font-&s;tone, were erected alwaies mo&s;t filthy &s;pectacles mo&s;t vg|ly to behold.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Item,</HI> many thou&s;and of godly and re|ligious bookes, among which were many hun|dred
<PB REF="3"> Bibles, the witne&s;&s;es of Gods mo&s;t holy Word, vtterly burnt with fire.</P>
<P N="11">11. Moreouer, (a griefe aboue all griefes) many thou&s;ands that profe&s;&s;ed the Go&s;pell, were mo&s;t cruelly and &s;hamefully tormented and tortured, and by the &s;ame torments com|pelled &s;hamefully, to denie and renounce the truth of Chri&s;ts Euangell.</P>
<P N="12">12. Compelling tho&s;e of the Religion to &s;weare vpon their &s;aluation neuer to renounce that damnable Popi&s;h Idolatrie, the which they were now forced to by torments.</P>
<P N="13">13. The poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people, were al&s;o compelled to their extreame co&s;t and char|ges, to vphold and maintaine a &s;trong gard of Souldiers, for tho&s;e cruell Commi&s;&s;aries owne obedient <HI>mancipia</HI> and <HI>e&ugrave;otoria.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. The con&s;tant Confe&s;&s;ors and Profe&s;|&s;ors of Chri&s;ts mo&s;t holy Word and Go&s;pell, together with their Wiues, and innocent Babes, were mo&s;t cruelly compelled to leaue their dwellings and habitations (whether it were in Cities, Townes, or Villages) at the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e barbarous Co~mi&s;&s;aries; and the longe&s;t terme of their abode was, &s;ix weekes and three dayes, &s;ometimes but eight dayes, and &s;ometimes they mu&s;t be gonne be|fore Sun-&s;etting, and &s;ometimes in the colde&s;t time of Winter, in Fro&s;t and Snow: although it be manife&s;t by the peace of Religion, gran|ted
<PB REF="4"> in the yeere of God 1555. (as appeares by the <HI>Formalia</HI>) that all Subiects or Tenants vn|der Prince, or Noble-man, who were per&s;e|cuted for Religion, might freely choo&s;e the time of their departure out of the Countrie.</P>
<P N="15">15. They were not admitted time and lei|&s;ure, to make &s;ale of their Lands and Goods, but (as may appeare by that cruell <HI>Edict &s;pe|cialis</HI>) they were con&s;trained &s;hamefully to &s;ell them, to their vn&s;peakeable lo&s;&s;e, yea, and &s;ometimes compelled to giue them; notwith|&s;tanding, that it mo&s;t manife&s;tly appeares al&s;o, by the fore&s;aid peace of Religion, that there &s;hould be no compul&s;ion, in &s;elling or giuing of Goods or Lands, excepting only, in <HI>amore Chri&s;tianae Religionis.</HI></P>
<P>And if they did &s;ell their Goods or Lands, they were compelled to giue the tenth Penny thereof, as by way of taxation; alledging that in Electorall Princes and States Lands of the Empire they did the like. But, as it appeares plainely by the afore&s;aid peace of Religion, it is &s;aid, tho&s;e Countries &s;hall pay the tenth Penny, who formerly did doe the &s;ame; but the&s;e our Countries haue euer beene free of tho&s;e taxations. We omit to remember that tho&s;e Iewes who were iu&s;tly expelled not long &s;ince, were freely pardoned this taxation.</P>
<P N="16">16. Notwith&s;tanding, tho&s;e Iewes were bound by bond, to pay the tenth Penny, at
<PB REF="4"> their departure out of the Land <HI>per modum Compen&s;ationis;</HI> but tho&s;e poore Chri&s;tian Ex|iles mu&s;t be bani&s;hed &amp; troubled, and forced not only to quit their Countrey, Friends, al|liance &amp; acquaintance; not only debarred the fruits of their labours, but al&s;o mu&s;t be bereft of that little money appointed for their main|tenance, in this their wofull bani&s;hment.</P>
<P N="17">17. And this was not a bani&s;hment with moderation to tho&s;e deuout and mo&s;t faithfull Chri&s;tians and our beloued Patriots, but they were exiled vnder paine of death neuer to re|turne. A bani&s;hment mo&s;t infamous and mo&s;t lamentable, that a man mu&s;t bee con&s;trained neuer to returne to the place of his natiuitie, there, where &s;o many yeeres he had dwelt with honor and re&s;pect; there where are the &s;epul|chers of his dead predece&s;&s;ors. Although it be expre&s;ly &s;et downe in the often &s;poken of peace of Religion, that it &s;hall not be preiudi|ciall for any man, freely to vi&s;ite his Countrie, and friends, from whom hee is bani&s;hed for Religion.</P>
<P N="18">18. Al&s;o the Noble-men, and others of tho&s;e Prouinces being Prote&s;tants, were not exempted this infamy, but were put by their hereditary offices of State, onely becau&s;e they were of the Religion; and others were placed in their offices, being men of no qualitie or merit, and only becau&s;e they were of Romi&s;h
<PB REF="5"> Religion. Our Prote&s;tant Noble-men, were al|&s;o hindred from being Admini&s;trators, or exe|quutors to their friends or their children, al|thoug they deale neuer &s;o faithfully: Which &s;hewes mo&s;t plainely, that the&s;e wrongs done vnto them, was not for the in&s;ufficiencie of their per&s;ons, births, or qualities, but only becau&s;e they were Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P N="19">19. Al&s;o the Noble-men and Gentrie of tho&s;e Prouinces being Prote&s;tants, were mo&s;t grieuou&s;ly taxed and cau&s;ed to pay great and grieuous &s;ummes of money, ouer &amp; aboue the tenth penny; notwith&s;tanding that they had quitted their Churches, Schooles, Preachers, and Schoole-ma&s;ters: yea, euen tho&s;e that wil|lingly would &s;ometimes goe out of the Coun|trey for deuotion, to heare a Sermon, or com|municate, were con&s;trained to pay the tenth penny, being out of his Highne&s;&s;e Countries; although it be manife&s;t <HI>de iure,</HI> that <HI>nemo ex|tra territorium &s;uum</HI> can puni&s;h any man. All the&s;e iniuries are directly again&s;t his High|ne&s;&s;e (now Emperour) owne Edict, giuen to tho&s;e of the Religion the la&s;t of Aprill, 1599.</P>
<P N="20">20. The&s;e great and grieuous troubles and tyrannicall vexations, which wee haue beene and are plagued withall, were not &s;o much to be pittied, if there were any hope of our ea&s;e, or reliefe. But alas! the vnmercifull an&s;wer and re&s;olution of his Highne&s;&s;e (now
<PB REF="5"> Emperour) giuen to the Prote&s;tants the eighth of December 1609. which was plainely told tho&s;e of the religion, That he would ne|uer yeeld to their demandes, and that hee would continue in this his re&s;olution euen till his graue; and that before he would yeeld for any of the lea&s;t of their demands, concerning their Religion, he would rather aduenture the lo&s;&s;e of all that euer he had of God, and with a white Staffe, goe barefooted out of all his Countries. Al&s;o his Highne&s;&s;e (now Empe|rour) did threaten mightily the Prote&s;tant E|&s;tates, vowing that he would be reuenged on them, for &s;eeking any tolleration; alleadging that it was again&s;t his princely Authoritie.</P>
<P N="21">21. To conclude, this la&s;t is the wor&s;t of all, that his Highne&s;&s;e (now Emperor) will not heare his Nobility &amp; Gentry, nor one of tho&s;e of the Religion, but he oftentimes co~manded them vpon paine of their liues to keepe per|petuall &s;ilence: as in Anno 1598. the thirtyeth of September; the fifth of May 1599. the fifth of March 1601. and this la&s;t time, the eighth of December 1609. Al&s;o it is mo&s;t manife&s;t in that Edict, in the yeere 1599. hee ab&s;olutely forbids vnder the paine of death, that no man of what degree or qualitie what&s;oeuer, &s;hould entertaine any Preacher or Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pell; vowing al&s;o that hee will not heare any more of their grieuances: Which is, <HI>dura
<PB REF="6"> &amp; acerbavox regnantis, non velle audire &amp; &s;cripta accipere, contr&agrave; qu&agrave;m Vetula illa obijciebat Regi Macedonum</HI> Philippo <HI>audi|entiam recu&s;anti: Si non vis audire, noli er|go Regnare.</HI> The abu&s;es in Religion is no new thing, e&s;pecially of the &s;pirituall &s;ort, but if the Spiritualitie did commit any ex|ce&s;&s;e, or gaue any euill example, it was to be &s;eene into by their temporall Princes and Lords, as we haue a fine example in the Hi|&s;tory of <HI>Stiria</HI> (fol. 81,) in the yeere of God 1518. When Doctor <HI>Luther</HI> had gotten the vpper hand, he gaue in a long <HI>Catalogue</HI> of Complaints and abu&s;es of the Clergie to the Emperour <HI>Maximilian,</HI> complayning of the abu&s;es of their Benefices, their neglect of Gods Seruice, the in&s;olencies commit|ted in their Dioce&s;&s;e, the carele&s;ne&s;&s;e of their &s;aluation, of the euill gouerning of Church liuings, and of the too many idle per&s;ons, that were maintained to the heauie burthen of the Countrey, as &s;undry &s;orts of <HI>Abbots, Canonicats, Prebendes, Commendats,</HI> and many others: his Imperiall Maie&s;tie graci|ou&s;ly did promi&s;e a redre&s;&s;e, giuing com|mand to all Dukes and Lords, to &s;ee a re|formation. But at this time there is greater cau&s;e of redre&s;&s;e of abu&s;es, &s;ince it is to bee plainely &s;eene, that wickedne&s;&s;e hath gotten
<PB REF="6"> the vpper hand, and alas! there is no hope of helpe, or redre&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>If this Prince deales &s;o hardly with his owne, much more cruelty is to be looked for at his hands, if he can haue the vpper hand of o|thers.</P>

<HEAD>The mo&s;t humble Supplication of cer|taine of the States of lower <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> made vnto the Emperour: Wherein is &s;hewed the mo&s;t terrible, inhumane, and barbarian tyrannyes, committed by the Emperours Souldiers, by the <HI>Ca&s;ockes</HI> and <HI>Wallons</HI> in the &s;aid Countrie.</HEAD>
<P>MO&s;t gracious Prince, the vn&s;peakeable &s;poyling, de&s;truction, mi&s;erie, trou|ble, calamitie, and &s;ubiection of the&s;e countries, wrought and effected by the accur|&s;ed Co&s;ackes and others your Maie&s;ties Soul|diers brought into the &s;ame, together with the robbings, murtherings, &s;ackings, bur|nings, ma&s;&s;acrings, and other barbarian cru|elties v&s;ed and committed therein, mooueth and prouoketh vs in the name and behalfe of our principall Lords &amp; the whole Countrey, to take and haue our recour&s;e, next vnto God, to your Emperiall Maie&s;tie, with &s;ighes and teares to renew our former complaints. In regard that the &s;ame (in the lea&s;t degree) are not yet redre&s;&s;ed, neither hath your Imperi|all Maie&s;ty, nor you Generals granted any me&s;&s;age, nor Mandate in writing for their &s;afe conducts; and to obtayne &s;ome reliefe therein for your poore &s;ubiects. For although your Maie&s;ty hath heretofore oftentimes beene certified and adui&s;ed, how and in what manner
<PB REF="8"> the Countrie in generall is &s;poyled and de|&s;troyed, both the Gentil-men and Commons rob'd and ran&s;ackt, &s;ome of the Pe&s;ants kild, and &s;ome of them driuen from hou&s;e &amp; home into the Woods, and Mountaynes; Vines and earable Lands &s;poyled and laid wa&s;te, huma|nitie &s;et a&s;ide; vertue, mode&s;tie, hone&s;tie, po|licy, law and right hindred and neglected, and an innumerable company of &s;innes, and &s;hame|full and horrible actions are daily committed, and cruelly exerci&s;ed by the Souldiers. Your Maie&s;tie hauing mo&s;t graciou&s;ly granted and promi&s;ed, to take &s;peedy order for the redre&s;|&s;ing and preuention thereof; and to that end vouch&s;afed your Gracious Commi&s;&s;ion to the Generall of your army, for the cea&s;ing and &s;tay of the &s;ame: being compelled thereunto by meere nece&s;&s;itie and force, your poore and humble Subiects are againe vnited to renew their &s;aid complaints, and to let your Maie&s;ty know, that the &s;aid in&s;olencies are not by any meanes cea&s;ed, nor yet le&s;&s;ened, but rather from day to day, and continually, are &s;till com|mitted, and more and more encrea&s;ed and wax &s;tronger, yea, and in &s;uch barbarian, vnchri|&s;tian, and inhumane manner, that we are a&s;to|ni&s;hed and aba&s;hed to thinke thereon, and in a manner haue a dete&s;tation to name them to certifie your Maie&s;ty thereof. Therefore &s;ith the vnruly Souldiers, &s;pecially the Co&s;ackes,

Wee, being vpon more then a &s;ure ground, for that we are certainely per&s;waded in our con&s;ciences, that it cannot be an&s;we|red before God, together with the States, who&s;e Officers are re&s;pectiuely to maintaine the Countrie, moued with no &s;mall griefe and inward vexation of mind to behold the mi&s;e|rable &s;tate of the country-people, &amp; being go|uernours and fathers of the &s;ame, (as the du|ty of euery Gouuernor and State&s;-man bind|eth him) mo&s;t heartily and earne&s;tly de&s;iring and wi&s;hing to &s;ee a remedie therein. Hoping that your Imperiall Maie&s;tie, will not in any wi&s;e be offended, nor take it in euill part, that in &s;ome &s;ort we make the &s;ame knowne vnto your Maie&s;ty, only to the end, that your &s;aid Maie&s;ty, as a Chri&s;tian Potentate, and a mo&s;t gracious Prince of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, may the rather with all &s;peede &s;eeke to remedy, and take ayde for the diuerting of the&s;e great, mo&s;t enorme, and mi&s;chieuous proceedings.</P>
