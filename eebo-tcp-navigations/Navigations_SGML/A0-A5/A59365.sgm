<HEAD>The <HI>Petition of divers Courtiers, Citizens, and Trade&s;mens wives concernig the &s;taying of the Queenes intended Voyage into</HI> Holland. <HI>&s;heweth,</HI></HEAD>
<P>THat your petitioners, their Husbands, their Children, and their Families, amounting to many thou&s;and &s;oules, have lived in plentifull and good fa&s;hion, by the exerci&s;e of &s;eve|rall Trades, and venting of divers workes: For learning whereof, many of them have &s;erved Apprenti&s;hips, others taken hou&s;es and &s;hops both in the Citie and Suburbs, and al&s;o in the Exchanges at very great rents: All depending wholy for the &s;ale of their com|modities, (which is the maintenance and very exi&s;tence and being of them&s;elves, their Husbands, and Families) upon the &s;plendor and glory of the Engli&s;h Court, and principally upon that of the Queenes Maje&s;ty; By occa&s;ion of who&s;e Royall pre&s;ence we have hitherto had ready utterance for our commodities, and were there|by enabled to pay currents, and live in good repute: But upon late notice that her Maje&s;ty is re&s;olved in&s;tantly to depart the Kingdom, we cannot but thereby fore-&s;ee an utter ce&s;&s;ation &amp; decay of all our Trading; So &s;hall we become utterly di&s;abled to pay our rents, &s;upport our &s;elves, or our families; and can apprehend nothing but di&s;traction, penury, and ruine: Or that our eminent and inevitable nece&s;&s;ities will produce &s;ome violent effect. And your Petitioners have cau&s;e to feare that this &s;udden re&s;olution in her Maje&s;tie is oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome ju&s;t di&s;ta&s;te taken at divers unu&s;uall and tumul|tuous a&s;&s;emblies, to the affright of her Royall per&s;on, and at the un|puni&s;ht printing of many licentious and &s;candalous pamphlets, &s;ome covertly, &s;ome plainly, wounding her &s;acred Maje&s;ty in the opinion of the vulgar, as an Abbettor or Coun&s;ellor of &s;uch de&s;ignes, which are preten|ded to di&s;turbe the peaceable government both of this Kingdome and <HI>Ire|land:</HI> Whereas your Petitioners are confident She was not only a &s;oli|citous Mediator for the a&s;&s;embling of this gracious <HI>Parliament,</HI> but that &s;ince Her coming into this Kingdome She never did ill office to any par|ticular Subject, but hath oft been an In&s;trument of many Acts of mercy and grace, to multitudes of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people.</P>
<P>And your petitioners likewi&s;e con&s;idering the great happine&s;&s;e brought to this Nation in her princely I&s;&s;ue, of which native com|fort this Nation hath been barren now almo&s;t a hundred yeeres; are the more encouraged,</P>
<P>Humby to pray, <HI>That this Honourable A&s;&s;emby would give &s;ome &s;peedy a&s;&s;u|rance to her Maje&s;ty, that the Anthors and In&s;tigators of &s;uch &s;editious tumults and &s;candals &s;hall be &s;trictly inquired after, and puni&s;h'd; and that &s;hee may re|ceive &s;uch publique vindication by the Parliament, again&s;t all &s;uch calumners of her &s;acred Maje&s;ty; and give Her that due honour and reverence wee are &s;ure She merits, and joyne with us in Petition for her continuall re&s;idence among&s;t us: whereby &s;he re receiving full a&s;&s;urance of the love and fidelity of Her Subjects in this Kingdome; your Petitioners may with &s;ome comfort addre&s;&s;e them&s;elves to Her Maje&s;ties compa&s;sion of her affectionate people, humbly to pray her &s;tay,,</HI></P>
