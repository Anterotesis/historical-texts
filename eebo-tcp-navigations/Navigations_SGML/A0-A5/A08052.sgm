<P>Now when they enterpri&s;e any attempt with their Gallies, they make a mo&s;t hideous noy&s;e with crying, calling, hooping, hallowing, playing on Drums, and Ba&s;on, as if they were all out of their wittes: the Gen|tlemen (&s;tanding aloft in the Gallie with their weapons in their hands) make many crooked leapes, &s;pringing this way &amp; that way: he which can &s;pring be&s;t, thinkes him&s;elfe the trimme&s;t fellow, and is not a little proud thereof.

They al&s;o brought an other wo|man with them, but they cut her in the midle in two pee|ces with a Sable or Curtlar, in &s;o much that they liued mo&s;t bea&s;tly with the people, whereby we might &s;ee that they were a mo&s;t bloody &amp; tyranicall nation. But not con|tented that they had thus butcherly prayed vpon their neighbours, and murthered them, 5. or 6. dayes after in de&s;pight of their enemies, they went vp &amp; downe the &s;treets bragging, with their weapons yet red with the blood of their enemies, for in &s;uch bloody actions they take a mer|uelous pride, e&s;pecially that they had &s;o well effected this bloody &s;tratagem: yet not with&s;tanding this their mortal hatred, they buried the heads of their &s;layne enemies very honourably, the order whereof was thus.

<P>_THE manners and policie v&s;ed in <HI>Ban|tam</HI> are very &s;trange, for when a man dyeth, leauing behinde him any goods, whether he haue children or none, the King &s;eazeth vpon the widow, chil|dren, and goods, appropriating all to him&s;elfe: making the Mother his &s;laue: and if a man of <HI>China</HI> de&s;ire to buye the Mother or daughter, he &s;elleth them, and if afterwards they chance to haue children betw&eacute;ene them, it happeneth to her a|gaine as it did after her fir&s;t hu&s;bands death, if the King doe vnder&s;tand of any goods left by the decea&s;ed: &s;uch as haue any wealth, haue no other meanes to preuent this mi&s;chiefe, but onely to marrie their children while they are young, whereby they may inherite their Parents goods: wherefore they are married when they are but twelue or thirt&eacute;ene yeares of age and younger, if they be of very rich Parents: and (which is more &s;trange) &s;ome|times &s;uch rich children haue two or thr&eacute;e Wiues, accor|ding as they abounde in wealth, and this is done to pre|uent the King of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of their goods after they are dead.</P>
<P>In their trade and traffike, they are meruailous th&eacute;e|ui&s;h, both the people of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>lava,</HI> in &s;o much that they let not to helpe them&s;elues with fal&s;e waights, fal|&s;efying and mingling their Pepper with blacke &s;and and &s;mall &s;tones, to make it weigh heauie: they are al&s;o fal&s;e

of their word or promi&s;e, and giuen to man-&s;laughter: for if it &s;o chaunce that two fight, and the one killeth the o|ther, he which liueth (knowing that he mu&s;t dye) will &s;tab and kill euery one where he can or may, &s;paring net|ther man, woman, nor childe, no not the children &s;ucking the Mothers brea&s;t, &s;o long vntill he be ouercome by force and multitude of people: then is he brought before the Gouernour, who pronounceth &s;entence vpon him, and after &s;uch iudgement giuen, hee is thru&s;t into the brea&s;t with a dagger, that he falleth to the ground: but it chaunceth &s;eldome that &s;uch an one is apprehended al&s;ue, for commonly they are &s;laine before they be taken.</P>

<P>The &s;ixt&eacute;enth day about noone wee had &s;ight of the I&s;land of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> wherewith wee were all greatly comforted.</P>
<P>The 17. day in the morning we had &s;ight of a Carrack n&eacute;ere vnto the land, being the Admirall of the Portugals Fl&eacute;ete, &s;ayling into the roade of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> where lay at anchor thr&eacute;e other Carracks, whereby wee were forced to put into the old Roade, which is the fir&s;t valley that you come vnto after you are pa&s;&s;ed the Northwe&s;t cor|ner, or necke of the land, and the Roade where the Car|racks lay is the third valley beyond the &s;ayd necke of the land, &s;o that we lay within Sakar or Minion &s;hot of each other: wee &s;ent vnto them foure men to parley with them, but I cannot write what communication pa&s;&s;ed.

<P>The 18. day foure of our men went vp into the land at S. <HI>Helena,</HI> it is a very high hillie land, beautified and in|riched with very faire and plea&s;ant valleys, with great aboundance of Goates, and &s;ome &s;tore of Swine: wee meant to prouide our &s;elues there of fre&s;h water, but the Portugales would not &s;uffer vs, &s;o that we were with|out

hope to make any proui&s;ion of water at this place: for they had ordained a &s;trong watch on the &s;hore, which was the onely cau&s;e that wee could not here refre&s;h our &s;elues.</P>
<P>The 21. being <HI>A &s;cention</HI> day, wee &s;ailed thence (with God his helpe) homewards, and being vnder &s;aile, w&eacute;e de&s;cried another Carrack making towards the Roade, which was the &s;ixt Carrack that we had now &s;eene, w&eacute;e directed our cour&s;e Northwe&s;t and by We&s;t.</P>
<P>Furthermore, touching the I&s;land of S. <HI>Helena,</HI> the &s;ame is a very fruitful and an health&s;ome land, with &s;uch incredible multitude of fi&s;h in the Roade, that it may &s;eeme a thing hardly to be bel&eacute;ued, the mo&s;t part Mac|kerell, and &s;ome other &s;mall fi&s;hes, as Breames, and o|ther &s;orts which haue great eyes like vnto Haddocks, but their bodies more flat.</P>
<P>The 25. of the &s;ame moneth wee were in thirt&eacute;ene de|gr&eacute;es, with a Northe&s;t winde, but it la&s;ted not long be|fore it turned againe to the Southe&s;t, and &s;o it continued for the mo&s;t part after we were pa&s;t the <HI>Cape.</HI></P>
<P>The 30. day in the morning we had &s;ight of the I&s;land called <HI>A&s;cention,</HI> which lieth eight degr&eacute;es Southward the Line, and the &s;ame euening we ca&s;t our anchors ne&eacute;re to the &s;hore thereof.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night we &s;et men a&s;hore to take view of the place, and the next morning wee &s;ent more of our people to &s;earch and view all places, but found no fre&s;h water, no not &s;o much as one draft. This I&s;land is full of &s;tonie rocks &amp; holes, like vnto the &s;inders of Sea-coales which are thorowly burnt: wee &s;aw &s;ome Swine al&s;o in this I&s;land, not without great marueile how they could there liue, for there is neither tr&eacute;e, leafe, nor gra&s;&s;e, and that much more is, a man is not able to de&s;cribe the bad|nes and barrennes of the ground: but a man may there

There was al|&s;o &s;ome rea&s;onable &s;tore of fi&s;h to be taken.</P>
<P>The la&s;t day of May in the euening wee wayed our anchors, hoy&s;ed our &s;ailes, and departed from the I&s;land <HI>A&s;cention,</HI> with God his helpe, &s;ailing homewards with a fine gale from the Southe&s;t, &s;haping our cour&s;e North|we&s;t and by We&s;t.</P>
<P>In the end, after great paynes, trauaile, and &s;icknes, which we &s;pecially &s;uffered for want of fre&s;h water, the&s;e two &s;hips arriued in the <HI>Texell,</HI> and afterwards being di&s;charged of our lading, we came with great comfort to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to the incredible ioye of the owners and Marchants (as may well be thought) &s;eeing now all the eight &s;hips were with great profit &s;afely returned to to their wi&s;hed home, which had b&eacute;en &s;ent out the fir&s;t day of March 1598. in companie to the I&s;lands of the Ea&s;t Indes.
