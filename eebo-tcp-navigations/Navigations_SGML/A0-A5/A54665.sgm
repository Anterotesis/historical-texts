<P>_I Have at la&s;t demoli&s;hd tho&s;e difficulties which in|tercepted this Work, in that progre&s;s it endevoured to make, to offer it &s;elf up both to yours and the pub|lick view. Yet I do not deny, in a Peice made rugged with &s;o many knots, &s;everal Mi&s;takes and Omi&s;&s;ions mu&s;t (through Inad|vertency and Mi&s;-information) have &s;lip'd in; &s;ome of which had their fir&s;t extraction from the Pre&s;&s;e, and &s;ome their birth from my Pen: All which I have collected into a Table of <HI>Addenda,</HI> which is imme|diately &s;ub&s;equent to the Preface, whither the Rea|der may retire to di&s;per&s;e all &s;cruples.</P>
<P>Secondly, I have not added any Numerical Al|phabet, to direct the Reader, &s;ince the Book is &s;o Alphabetically dige&s;ted, that the Work is a Dire|ctory Beam or Ray to it &s;elf: To which I have an|nex'd, as an Appendage, a particular De&s;cription of all the circumambient <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I have not &s;o tyed my &s;elf up to tho&s;e &s;everer Di&s;cour&s;es which I have extracted from either publick or private Record, but that I have embroi|der'd this Peice with Di&s;cour&s;es of a &s;ofter com|plexion;
<PB REF="3">as at <HI>Bil&s;ington,</HI> I have unfolded the Cau|&s;es of the Depravation of the ancient Clergy, both in Doctrine and Manners; at <HI>Birling</HI> I have di&s;co|vered the nature of that Tenure, <HI>Antiquity</HI> call'd <HI>Tenure per Baroniam;</HI> at <HI>Ewell</HI> I have unravell'd the fir&s;t In&s;titution of the <HI>Knights Templers,</HI> and the probable cau&s;es of their total extirpation; at <HI>New|ington Lucies</HI> I have di&s;cours'd largely of <HI>&V;rne En|terment;</HI> at <HI>Rodmer&s;ham,</HI> no le&s;s of the In&s;titution of the <HI>Knights Ho&s;pitallers;</HI> at <HI>Werth</HI> I have trea|ted of the <HI>Antiquity</HI> of <HI>Seals;</HI> at <HI>Wymings Would,</HI> of the <HI>Ancient Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Pileus;</HI> and have at &s;everal other places enterlac'd this Work with colla|teral Di&s;cour&s;es of the &s;ame tincture.</P>
<P>What&s;oever this Peice may appear in the whole Frame and Bulk of it, I do a&s;&s;ure you it was not born without your Influence, it is ready to die at your Command, and cannot live but by your Ac|ceptance. But I know you have both Art and Can|dor; and as I cannot but hope, but that a merciful Interpretation will be emergent from the fir&s;t, &s;o I cannot doubt but the la&s;t will give &s;o noble an Allay to your Ju&s;tice, that if it cannot totally ab&s;olve, yet it may at lea&s;t excu&s;e</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>Preface</HI> to the READER.</HEAD>
<P>ANtiquity is the great Luminary of Time, which di&s;pels tho&s;e Clouds, that like a gloomy Skreen, interpo&s;ing between the object and the under&s;tanding, ca&s;t it into Error and Mi&s;apprehen&s;ion: And not onely of Time but of Hi&s;to|ry too; Hi&s;tory, that faithful Regi&s;ter of things pa&s;t, That great Informer of the pre&s;ent, and certain Prophet of the Future; By it we may di&s;cover the Print which former Ages made, and treading that, know how to decline the crooked and Irregular Paths of Danger and Misfortune. Antiquity is like the lamp in <HI>Tullia</HI>'s Urne, that repre&s;enting to our view by Grains and by Scruples the Re|liques and du&s;t of our long-&s;ince expired Ance&s;tors, which perhaps lay &s;catter'd in the Wilderne&s;s of their own Di&s;per&s;ion, erects a Monument to their Re|membrance, &s;o inacce&s;&s;able to all the on&s;ets and impre&s;&s;ions of age and oblivi|on, that then onely it &s;hall langui&s;h into Decay and di&s;&s;olution when Nature her &s;elf, and Time, the moth of Nature, &s;hall lye ga&s;ping in their own ruines, and the Univer&s;e it &s;elf &s;hall confe&s;s its A&s;hes.</P>
<P>And certinly, among&s;t all tho&s;e Trophies which antiquity hath fix'd upon the face of this I&s;land, there is none more Copious, if we con&s;ider them for quan|tity; nor more Con&s;picuous, if we repre&s;ent them in their quality, than tho&s;e that it hath left &s;catter'd upon the Continent of <HI>Kent:</HI> and this mu&s;t be obvious to the mo&s;t ea&s;ie Intellect, when it &s;hall di&s;cover that in all the Eruptions of forain Invaders upon this I&s;land, the fir&s;t track of that Thorough-fair hath been laid in, or very near, this County, by which they have farther penetrated into the Bowels of this Nation. We will wave that fiction of <HI>Brute</HI> and a partie of Fugitives (originally) as the <HI>Legend</HI> in&s;inuates of <HI>Trojan</HI> Extraction, and di&s;|carded from <HI>Italy</HI> for &s;ome Mi&s;demeanor there acted) fixing here, as likewi&s;e that Series of the Kings Sub&s;equent to him, being wholy obtruded upon us by &s;educed and mi&s;guided Hi&s;tories; the brain indeed of <HI>Jeffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> being both the Forge and the Anvill from whence tho&s;e &s;parks brake forth at fir&s;t, which made up that <HI>Ignis Fatuus</HI> after which the world &s;o long hath wandered.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then the <HI>Roman</HI> Eagles endevoured to &s;urprize and &s;ei&s;e on the Domi|nion of this I&s;land, though they were once or twice &s;o rudely grip'd by the <HI>Britains</HI> neare <HI>Chilham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and &s;ome of their noble&s;t Plumes torn from them, that they were forc'd to fly back into <HI>Gaule</HI> to new impe their Feathers but breaking in again with a recolected and multiplied &s;trength, the Liberty of this Nation &s;toop'd, and became a prey to their victorious Tallons, And now it was ordered that all Pleas, E&s;cripts, Decrees, Edicts, and other things of publique Cogni&s;ance &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued out in the <HI>Roman</HI> Dialect, that &s;o the roughne&s;s of the <HI>Britains,</HI> which their warlike inclinations had &s;o long entitled them to, might not onely by degrees be fil'd off, but that likewi&s;e being &s;uppled and &s;oftned by the <HI>Roman</HI> Culture, they might without any regret or re&s;ent|ment
<PB REF="6">&s;upport that load of &s;lavery that &s;at &s;o heavy on their &s;houlders, and &s;o at la&s;t become wholy riveted and incorporated into the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But this was onely in intention, for the accompli&s;hment and perfection of it, was &s;uper&s;eded by the Inroad of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> which like an Inundation in many &s;ignal conflicts had almo&s;t &s;wept away the Imperial dignitie, and &s;o torn the whole Bulk of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, that its very Spirit was ready to ebb out at tho&s;e breaches. So that in fine, the Emperour was forced to re|trive the Guards and Stationary Legions &s;cattered o're this I&s;land, with the&s;e like a new &s;tock of &s;pirits to improve and fortifie the Heart of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire, which was ready to bleed out its life at tho&s;e wounds that the hands of the&s;e Barbarous Nations had inflicted on it.</P>
<P>And now the &s;pirits of the <HI>Britains</HI> (a &s;tronger Buttere&s;s again&s;t the Eruptions of the <HI>Picts</HI> than the Wall erected by the <HI>Romans</HI>) being by the Engines of a long and habituated Servitude, cowed and broken into a degenerate Effe|minacie, they lay open to all the A&s;&s;aults and impre&s;&s;ions of the in&s;olent In|vader; &s;o that they were forced either to re&s;ign up them&s;elves to the fury and inclemency of the Sea, or el&s;e offer them&s;elves up to the Rage and Bar|barity of a Savage enemie: And now, being deve&s;ted of all protection at home, and all hope of &s;upply from abroad, being forelaid and intercepted by the In|va&s;ion of the <HI>Goths</HI> on the Empire, they made their addre&s;&s;es to the <HI>Saxons,</HI> a Martial People then inhabiting that nether part of <HI>Germany,</HI> which is wa&s;hed by the Rivers of <HI>Elve, Wea&s;er,</HI> and <HI>Rhine,</HI> who in&s;tantly upon Covenant and a&s;|&s;urance of a va&s;t Guerdon to ballance their &s;ervices, under the conduct of <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;a,</HI> embarqued for <HI>Britain</HI> and landed in the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet,</HI> and &s;hortly after with &s;uch vigour and animo&s;ity repre&s;&s;ed the in&s;olencies of the <HI>Picts,</HI> that they &s;hut them up within the Cloi&s;ters and Rece&s;&s;es of their own Mountains. But it might be &s;aid of them, as it was anciently of Religion; <HI>Religion brought forth Riches, and the Daughter devoured the Mother:</HI> So the&s;e <HI>Saxons,</HI> from A&s;&s;ertors and Protectors of the <HI>Britains,</HI> became at la&s;t Invaders of them; for they repre&s;enting to the other <HI>Saxons</HI> the health|fulne&s;s of the Air, and the temperatene&s;s of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Clime, who were over-&s;tocked and cloyed with exce&s;s of People, and were willing to evacuate that &s;urcharge of Inhabitants into forain Colonies, they in&s;tantly attaqued any advantage that might put them into Ho&s;tilitie with the <HI>Britains;</HI> and pre|tending that that Compact &s;o &s;olemnely &s;tipulated and tran&s;acted between them and <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> was infringed and violated, they poured them&s;elves in like a <HI>Cataract</HI> upon this I&s;land, &s;o that the <HI>Britains</HI> to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the fury of this Deluge, after many vigorous attempts to make it flow back a|gain, &s;hut up them&s;elves within the Solitudes and Rece&s;&s;es of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> while&s;t on their ruines their adver&s;aries erected and fixed their <HI>Saxon Heptarchie;</HI> which again, after many mutual encounters, wherein almo&s;t every Turfe of this I&s;land was be&s;patter'd and bedewed with Blood, found a publique Tombe in the <HI>We&s;t-Saxon</HI> Monarchie.</P>
<P>But &s;carce was the Ba&s;is of it e&s;tabli&s;hed, who&s;e Ciment was &s;o much Blood and Tears; But God, who corrects the Ambitious by retaliation and cha&s;ti&s;es the in&s;olencies of one Invader by ca&s;ting another into Competion with him, put the <HI>Dane</HI> into Ballance with the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who like a whirlewind threw him&s;elf upon this I&s;land &s;o that all blooming Glories of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Greatne&s;s did wither and &s;hrivell up, being &s;uddenly nipt and bla&s;ted by this Northern tempe&s;t. I &s;hall not di&s;cypher the long, many, and impetuous encounters between the&s;e two fierce Nations, with the effu&s;ion of Blood
<PB REF="6">and the ruine and Depredation that di&s;complexioned every part of the Land; indeed, they are of &s;o di&s;ordered a Memory, and then &s;o blended and con|founded in the Per&s;ons, Times, and Places, upon which the Scene of the&s;e de|formed Tragedies is intricately fixt, that it would be (as one well ob&s;erves) ano|ther war to the Reader to over-look them. In brief, after a &s;ignal combat per|&s;onally commenced between <HI>Edmund Iron&s;ide</HI> and <HI>Canutus,</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Atheleny,</HI> both armies on either &s;hore, being Spectators, the <HI>Saxon</HI> Diadem was by reciprocall compact to be devided between them: which after the decea&s;e of <HI>Edmund Iron&s;ide</HI> at <HI>Oxford;</HI> which, whether it were Naturall or Artificiall, is yet a controver&s;ie, wholly inve&s;ted the Temples of <HI>Canutus.</HI></P>
<P>But alas! upon what a frail and incertain Pede&s;tal is all humane greatne&s;s &s;etled? For the lu&s;tre of this new erected Monarchy had no &s;ooner di&s;played its beams in <HI>Canutus,</HI> but like an unthrifty Taper it began to glimmer in <HI>Har|old,</HI> and ab&s;olutely expired in <HI>Hardiknute,</HI> who dying i&s;&s;uele&s;s, the current of Royalty ran back again into the chanel of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Blood, which flow'd in the veins of <HI>Edward</HI> Sirnamed the <HI>Confe&s;&s;or;</HI> who likewi&s;e decea&s;ing with|out I&s;&s;ue, <HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy</HI> upon a pretended Donation from the la&s;t <HI>Edward</HI> entitles him&s;elf to the right and intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Diadem.</P>
<P>But this certainly was invail'd, for no Te&s;tamentary collation can ravell or di&s;order &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which with an indi&s;&s;olueble link is chain'd and fa&s;tned to the neare&s;t of Blood, and of which the Nation is to take the &s;ole and proper Cogni&s;ance:) And to a&s;&s;ert his title (which was fixt on the point of his &s;word) he arives in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> with a numerous Army, to check who&s;e farther Progre&s;s in this I&s;land, <HI>Harold</HI> advances likewi&s;e with a con&s;iderable Army (who&s;e body had before evapourated its be&s;t and noble&s;t Spirits at tho&s;e wounds which it before had received in a bloody encounter comenc'd with <HI>Harold Har&s;anger</HI> King of <HI>Norwey:</HI>) And nere that place where afterwards was founded the Abby of <HI>Battell,</HI> puts his claim to the Scepter, likewi&s;e to the Deci&s;ion and Umpirage of the Sword, and after a fierce di&s;pute found the Tombe of his new purchas'd Royalty in the carriage of this Field, upon who&s;e ruines, <HI>William</HI> now a Con|querour, climbs up the A&s;cent of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t de&s;ign (after he had &s;catter'd all tho&s;e clouds of di&s;content that might have po&s;&s;ibly have enwrapt the rays of acquired Maje&s;ty in &s;ome new umbrage,) was to take a Survey of each mans particular intere&s;t and Patrimony, which was inroll d and recorded in a publique Regi&s;ter commonly called <HI>Doom&s;|day</HI> Book; upon pretence, that from a generall computation of the Revenue of the Nation, he might di&s;cern what &s;trength might be collected to intercept the violent attempts of any forain Invader upon this I&s;land. But indeed to make a &s;trict inqui&s;ition into the Forfeitures of the Lands of tho&s;e that had been in Ho&s;tility under the En&s;ignes of <HI>Harold</HI> again&s;t him, that with tho&s;e he might not onely endear and gratifie his Parti&s;ans, but likewi&s;e by reinve&s;ting the chiefe&s;t of his adver&s;aries in tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which were by their Enmity e&s;cheated, oblige them to maintain his Title and Scepter. Yet it is ob&s;erve|able, that he engag'd all tho&s;e that had receiv'd any Lands or Demea&s;nes of him, either by any new conce&s;&s;ion or re-inve&s;titure to hold them in E&s;cuage, that is by Knight Service, by which they were oblig'd when&s;oever either publique nece&s;&s;ity or his Commands did exact it of them, to attend his Per&s;on, either actually or virtually, that is by Proxie with Hor&s;e and Armes; and by this art he had always a power in re&s;erve to repre&s;s and &s;catter all Solleviations or &s;ud|den In&s;urrections at home, and contradict all the Attempts and Animo&s;ities of Adver&s;aries from abroad; that &s;o he might become con&s;iderable to his enemies,
<PB REF="7">and u&s;efull to his Friends. Thus have I compendiou&s;ly wound up the &s;everall Inva&s;ions made on this I&s;land, in which <HI>Kent</HI> was &s;o much concern'd. But there is another Inva&s;ion that I have not yet numbred, which hath been more ruinous and di&s;tructive to the noble&s;t Families of this I&s;land than any of tho&s;e above recited: and that is the Riot and Exce&s;s, that like an Infectious Cloud, who&s;e noy&s;ome wombe drops nothing but di&s;ea&s;e and Pe&s;telence, hath lately broke in upon this Nation, and &s;o withered the Root of the mo&s;t ancient Gentry, that they have &s;hrunk into their own ruines, and faln negelcted and forgotten: Indeed our modern Luxury is like the Poy&s;on of the Viper, it bla&s;ts invi&s;ibly, and di&s;troys in&s;en&s;ibly, and they that are &s;oftned with it are like a Tree, that feeds tho&s;e wormes that mu&s;t devoure it; or like Iron, that &s;upplyes that ru&s;t which will corode it. Indeed 'tis ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e Families have continued in their &s;plendor longer who&s;e &s;eats and habitations have engag'd them to a remoter di&s;tance from the Verge and Sphere of the City, than tho&s;e who&s;e Revenue and Patrimonie hath confin'd upon a place infected with &s;o much Debaucherie, and let loo&s;e into &s;o great exce&s;s. Yet, 'tis remarkable that the cadets, or younger &s;lips i&s;&s;ued out from &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;tems, who by their own vitious exorbitancie have crumbled into an inreparable decay, by being inoculated upon other Families, have by this tran&s;plantation contracted new&s;ap and verdure, and again &s;prouted out and flori&s;h'd. For Families are like the River of <HI>Arethu&s;a,</HI> they &s;ometimes &s;ink in one place or County, and again ri&s;e in another.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now take the County of <HI>Kent</HI> under Survey or Pro&s;pect, and repre|&s;ent to the publique view, tho&s;e &s;everal Antiquities which in my &s;earch I found to lie wrapt up either in common Records, or &s;hut up in the private Muniments, E&s;cripts, and Regi&s;ters of particular Families; from whom I have endevour'd to pluck off the veil that they may for the future &s;tand as an Alpha|bet to point out tho&s;e Families that are yet in being, that are totally exingui&s;h'd or that lye entomb'd in other Names and Extractions, which by Mariage have &s;wallowed up the Heir generall: In the pur&s;uit of which I confe&s;s I have not cloi&s;ter'd my &s;elf up in the nice re&s;traints of any preci&s;e or particular Method, becau&s;e that flood, both of private and publique inteligence, which like a Torrent broke in upon me, &s;wept away what&s;oever my bu&s;ie fancy had built upon the &s;ands of any curious or Methodical invention; But 'tis here, as in &s;ome Rivers who though they wander in a crooked and irregular chanell, yet are they the &s;ame Streames &s;till, as long as they hold corre&s;pondence with their fir&s;t Fountain and original.</P>
<P>I &s;hall remit all to the Ju&s;tice and Candor of the Reader, with the fir&s;t he may arraigne and cen&s;ure, with the la&s;t ab&s;olve and excu&s;e</P>

Be&s;ides, every Lord and Ma&s;ter &s;tood Borough for all his Family, whereof if any &s;ervant were cal'd in que&s;tion, the Ma&s;ter was to &s;ee him an&s;wer it in the HUNDRED where he was accus'd; if he fled, the Ma&s;ter was to re&s;igne &s;uch goods as he had to the King: If him&s;elf were accus'd to be aiding or privy to his Servants flight, he was to clear him&s;elf by five men, otherwi&s;e to forfeit all his Goods to the King, and his man to be Outlawed. The&s;e Links thus intermutually fa&s;tned, made formerly &s;o &s;trong a chain to hold the whole frame of the State toge|ther in Peace and order, as all the mingled policies upon Earth, all the inter-leagued Societies of Men cannot repre&s;ent a &s;traiter Form of combination.</P>
<P>As touching the other Cu&s;tomes of <HI>Kent,</HI> they have been &s;o fully di&s;cu&s;s'd by Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> in his <HI>Kenti&s;h Perambulation,</HI> that I &s;hall not much in&s;i&s;t in the di&s;cove|ry of them: only I &s;hall &s;omething winnow the word <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> becau&s;e from that it is pretended the Tenure it &s;elf is derived. Fir&s;t, it is &s;ugge&s;ted, that the word <HI>Gavelkind</HI> is ama&s;s'd together of three <HI>Saxon</HI> Mono&s;yllables, that is to &s;ay, <HI>Goef ele Kent:</HI> but how this Cu&s;tome &s;hould be originally e&s;tabli&s;hed on three Syllables by the corruption of Time thus crouded and &s;hut up in one word, is altogether ambi|guous and my&s;terious: For, if we &s;hall unvail the word of its <HI>Saxon</HI> Habit, and put it into an Engli&s;h dre&s;s, it will &s;ignifie thus much, <HI>Give all Child;</HI> and how much non&s;en&s;e lurks in that expre&s;&s;ion, I think is ea&s;ily di&s;cernable: Indeed the phra&s;e &s;hould be, if we would attempt to &s;pin any thing of advantage out of it, <HI>Goef ele Kendern, Give all Children,</HI> But how much of incongruitie and non-coherence lies wrapt up even in this, I beleeve is obvious enough; yet admit there were none, how four Syllables all of different vowels in their termination, &s;hould at length by the depravation of Language be all confu&s;edly &s;huffled and &s;tiv'd into this one word <HI>Gavelkind,</HI> will certainly appear to the mo&s;t ea&s;ie apprehen&s;ion di&s;putable enough.</P>
<P>For my own particular, I'm convinc'd (with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to cleerer &s;peculations) that this word <HI>Gavelkind</HI> is derived from the <HI>Saxon</HI> word <HI>Gabel,</HI> which in the Latin we render <HI>Cen&s;us,</HI> and put into Engli&s;h &s;ignifies &s;ome Rent-Service, or Tribute i&s;&s;uable from &s;uch and &s;uch Land, on which it is fixt as a &s;olemn evidence of &s;ome homage due to the Prince or &s;upreme Magi&s;trate, for that &s;ecurity which is received both in life and propriety by his defence and tuition. And certainly this is &s;ome|thing proportionate to Rea&s;on; for all <HI>Gavelkind</HI>-Land is held in the Tenure of free-Soccage, which is charg'd with this manner of Rent-charge or impo&s;ition; and &s;o in &s;everal Latine Records is repre&s;ented under the Notion of <HI>Terra Cen&s;ualis.</HI></P>
<PB N="3" REF="8">
<P>'Tis true, that by the ancient cu&s;tome of <HI>Germany,</HI> cal'd <HI>Land-Skiftan,</HI> the Lands of the decea&s;ed was by equal portions to be di&s;tributed among&s;t all the Sons; but then it is as probable that this Tribute or <HI>Gabel</HI> did accompany it, becau&s;e the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial part of this Cu&s;tome hath through the Channel of many hundred years flow'd down to this pre&s;ent Age, and is in force in &s;undry places in <HI>Germany</HI> at this in&s;tant: For though the Hernelickheis or Lord&s;hip, as they &s;tyle it, de&s;cend Patrimonially <HI>per Jus Dominatus,</HI> by the right of Signorie to the elder Son, yet all the Land ex|clu&s;iely from that is equally divided between the Cadets or younger Brothers, on|ly returning &s;ome incon&s;iderable Rent-Service to the Prince, as a character of that Fealtie thy owe him for &s;heltring them in their &s;everal Patrimonies by his mutual &s;upport and protection.</P>
<P>Certain it is when <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> tran&s;ported his <HI>Saxons</HI> fir&s;t into <HI>Britain,</HI> that Cu&s;tome of <HI>Land-Skiftan</HI> was wafted over with them, and was by him allow'd to his Abet|tors and Parti&s;ans when they were inve&s;ted in their new Acqui&s;ts and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>Kent,</HI> as all other Franchi&s;es and Immunities were, which before in <HI>Germany</HI> they were by pre&s;cription endow'd with, that they might more vigorou&s;ly improve his de&s;ignes upon this I&s;land; yet &s;till it is po&s;&s;ible he re&s;erved out of tho&s;e <HI>Demea&s;nes</HI> thus by Grant couveyed to his complices, &s;ome Annual Tax or Gabel (though per|haps of a low and narrow value) as a &s;ignal acknowledgement that the Superiori|ty or Soveraignty was &s;olely lodg'd in him.</P>
<P>There are two other Cu&s;tomes which are properly calculated for the Meridian of <HI>Romeney Mar&s;h,</HI> and perhaps through inadvertency were not recited by Mr. <HI>Lambert,</HI> and they are the&s;e: Fir&s;t, the King had anciently no Wa&s;t there, and &s;econdly he had no Wracks, but they were appropriated to tho&s;e Mannors of the <HI>Mer&s;h</HI> that con|fin'd on the Sea; and &s;urely if we fathom their original we &s;hall find their foundati|on e&s;tabli&s;hed on much of Rea&s;on. For fir&s;t, how could the Crown entitle it &s;elf to any Wa&s;t there, where the Sea by its impetuous encroachments did engage the Inha|bitants to ca&s;t up Mounts, and erect Banks in any place which they &s;hould find mo&s;t proportionate to their defence again&s;t the fury of &s;o formidable an adver&s;ary? For the &s;econd, it is very equitable that they that are intere&s;&s;ed in an expence of that va&s;t|ne&s;&s;e in which the Publique (by the obligation of nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences) is &s;o much concern'd and wrapt up, &s;hould have &s;omething of Emolument indulged to them by the careful Munificence of the Prince, to poi&s;e and ballance tho&s;e important di&s;|bur&s;ements which the ill neighbourhood of the Ocean does oblige them to, in fortifying the <HI>Mer&s;h</HI> with perpetual Defences and Dams again&s;t its a&s;&s;aults and eruptions. Having thus di&s;covered &s;omething in relation to the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Kent,</HI> before I advance farther into the Land, I &s;hall repre&s;ent what care our former Kings have embarqu'd them&s;elves in, to &s;ecure the Sea, by fixing Sea-watches and other Military Guards upon all the Avennues and Inlets of the Coa&s;t, to repre&s;&s;e and check the attempts of any bold Intruder, as if their own &s;afety and indemni|ty were folded up in the &s;ecurity of this County.</P>
<P>Touching then Sea-watches upon the Coa&s;t, there are three Pre&s;idents, and a Mandate from the King to the Sheriff in a time of a more modern in&s;cription for performing the like &s;ervice. The fir&s;t containing the watch by night in Record is &s;tyled <HI>Vigiliae minutae,</HI> which are due of right and cu&s;tome to be made by the Men of certain HUNDREDS, as by the Title thereof, and the Writ for Exe|cution of the &s;ame may appear.</P>
<P>The &s;econd concluding the Day-watch, hence called <HI>Wardan</HI> is arbitrary, and at the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e which in time of war and common danger had authority to appoint them, of the&s;e there are three examples, one of the 9 of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. (which I intend principally to trace, as being the original to the other) which year he made preparation to invade <HI>France,</HI> and to vindicate his Title to the Crown, and the other the 20. of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3. in which year he &s;ailed into <HI>France</HI> and triumphed in the Signal battail of <HI>Cre&s;cey.</HI></P>
<P>The third de&s;cribeth to who&s;e charge &s;everal parts of the &s;hore were a&s;&s;ign'd for defence, in the 29, of <HI>Fdward</HI> the 3. At what time he pa&s;t into <HI>France</HI> and was victo|rious in the Encounter of <HI>Poictiers.</HI> It di&s;covers al&s;o what parts of the Shire were to re&s;ort to the Coa&s;t for protection of the &s;ame. This order is arbitrary al&s;o,
<PB N="4" REF="9">as they that in the Record are &s;tyl'd <HI>Rectores Comitatus</HI> (that is, Lieutenants of the Shire) &s;hall think meet to appoint.</P>

<P>Becau&s;e there hath been frequent mention of <HI>Hobilers</HI> in the above&s;aid di&s;|cour&s;e, I &s;hall di&s;cover to the Reader a brief portraiture of them, as I have copied it by that Original which hath been pencil'd out by the learned indu&s;try of Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> in his <HI>Glo&s;&s;arie.</HI></P>
<P>The word <HI>Hobiler,</HI> &s;ayes he, is derived from the French word <HI>Hobill,</HI> which imports as much as a light quilted Ca&s;&s;ock; and indeed all the Latine Records &s;ay they &s;hould be <HI>Wampa&s;a armati,</HI> which &s;ignifies or denotes a Jack; and in &s;ome parts both of <HI>Germany</HI> and the Low Countreys, at this day <HI>Wampas</HI> is us'd to expre&s;s a Doublet or a &s;hort Ca&s;&s;ock: and if you will know with what Hor&s;e they were equip'd or furni&s;h'd for &s;ervice, the above&s;aid Author will tell you, that every <HI>Hobiler</HI> &s;hould be <HI>Mediocri eque in&s;tructus, &amp; ad omnem motum agili;</HI> a Hor&s;e of no great proportion, but light, and fitted for all manner of &s;ervice.</P>

<P>As for that Officer called the Serjeant of the Horn, be it under&s;tood as an ancient note of the Ports tenure by Cornage, from King <HI>Canutus</HI> time, by which, as the be&s;t Cu&s;tomals of the Cinque Ports inform me there Moots and publick A&s;&s;emblies are &s;ummoned, <HI>Sonitu Cornu.</HI></P>
<P>Having entred into a Di&s;cour&s;e of the Cinque Ports, I &s;hall take a farther prop&s;ect of tho&s;e privileges they were inve&s;ted with, from or before the Con|que&s;t, e&s;pecially by that &s;ignall Charter, which was granted to them in the 20 year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t. Fir&s;t, then they were exempted from all Taxes and Tallages, that they might with more vigor and alacriry be encouraged and emboldened to attend the publique Service.</P>
<P>Secondly, they had <HI>Sac</HI> and <HI>Soc, Sac</HI> is a privilege to take Cogni&s;ance of cau&s;es either Criminal or Civil within their own Courts, <HI>Soc</HI> is a power planted in them to compel all per&s;ons which live within the Confines of their Liberties, to plead in their Courts, and from hence anciently they were called <HI>Socmanni,</HI> that is, Suiters to that Court, where they were forced to plead.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they had <HI>Toll</HI> and <HI>Theam, Toll</HI> was a Liberty of buying and &s;el|ling within their own juisdiction, and a power to receive the <HI>Toll</HI> or <HI>Gabel</HI> impo&s;ed on commodities there vended. <HI>Theam</HI> is both a civil and coercive power or jurisdiction &s;ettled in them by Charter, over all tho&s;e who are inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or any of the limbs or members of them.</P>
<P>Fourthly, they had <HI>Bloodwith</HI> and <HI>Fledwith, Bloodwith</HI> is a power to puni&s;h the effu&s;i|on of Blood; <HI>Fledwith</HI> is an authority to puni&s;h tho&s;e who having committed any mi&s;demeanor or outrage, and &s;eeking to &s;ecure them&s;elves by flight, are again &s;ei&s;ed upon, and offered up to de&s;erved Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Fifthly, they had <HI>Pillorie</HI> and <HI>Tumbrell, Tumbrell</HI> was an Engine much re&s;embling our Cucking-&s;tool, and was in&s;tituted to re&s;train the fury of loud clamorous and impetu|ous Women.</P>
<P>Sixthly, they had <HI>Infangetheof</HI> and <HI>Cutfangetheof,</HI> that is a power to impri&s;on, and
<PB N="11" REF="12">upon ju&s;t and legal evidence (which is the Lanthorn of the Law) to execute all tho&s;e, though Forainers and Aliens which &s;hould commir any felony in places &s;ubject to their juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>Seventhly, they had <HI>Mundbriech;</HI> that is, a priviledge to rai&s;e banks and mounds on any per&s;ons land what&s;oever, who&s;e proprietie lay within their juri&s;diction, to &s;ecure the common Intere&s;t from the eruptions and ca&s;uall Inundations of the Sea&punc;</P>
<P>Eightly, they had <HI>Waives,</HI> called by a generall name in old Law-Latin <HI>Weveragium,</HI> and <HI>Strays Waives</HI> was a word of a common latitude, u&s;ed to &s;ignifie all tho&s;e things, either wandering Chattel, or other goods, which being waved or lo&s;t, and not claimed within a year and a day, were to be po&s;&s;e&s;t by tho&s;e within who&s;e juri&s;diction they were &s;eis'd, according to that of the Civill Law, <HI>Quae nullius juris &s;unt, &amp; pro derelictis habentur, cedunt occupanti.</HI> Strays is a word of a more circum&s;crib'd and re&s;trained &s;en&s;e, relating only to &s;tragling Cattel; to whom if none did entitle them&s;elves by claim in a year and a day, their propriety was inve&s;ted in tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;t them.</P>
<P>Ninthly, they had <HI>Wa&s;te</HI> and <HI>Strep,</HI> or E&s;trepment Wa&s;te was that parcell of common earth which by pre&s;cription and cu&s;tome belonged to the Crown, but by Charter was en&s;tated on them. <HI>Strip</HI> or <HI>E&s;trepment</HI> is a power granted to them to cut down Trees within their own juri&s;diction, without impeachment of wa&s;te.</P>
<P>In the tenth place, they had the grant of <HI>Flot&s;om, Jet&s;om, Wit&s;om: Flot&s;om</HI> were goods upon &s;ome vi&s;ible wrack floating to the &s;hore <HI>Jet&s;om,</HI> were goods in a &s;torme thown over board to pre&s;erve the Ship, and &s;inking did again buoy up them&s;elves, anr were again by the agitation of the waves thrown on the Strand. <HI>Wit&s;om</HI> were goods driven to the &s;hore, when there had not been for &s;ome &s;pace any wrack vi&s;ible; from whence they were anciently &s;tyled Goods of Gods mercy; <HI>Wit,</HI> in old Engli&s;h importing as much as <HI>Mi&s;ericordia</HI> in Latin.</P>
<P>Their eleventh priviledge was to be a <HI>Guild,</HI> that is a Fraternity or Combination of men that had all the Franchi&s;es of Court-Leet and Court-Baron annex'd to them; as likewi&s;e they were endow'd with a power upon emergent occa&s;ions to improve the common intere&s;t, to lay A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements and Taxes upon the Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports and their Members; the word <HI>Guild</HI> being extracted from an old Latin word called <HI>Geldo,</HI> which &s;ignifies to tax.</P>
<P>Their twelfth Franchi&s;e was, to a&s;&s;emble at <HI>Shepway,</HI> which was anciently called the Portmote or Parliament of the Cinque Ports; there they puni&s;h'd the infringers of their priviledges, and amerc'd all tho&s;e who being Inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, or of tho&s;e Towns which were circum&s;crib'd within their Juri&s;diction, &s;ued out of tho&s;e Courts which were properly e&s;tabli&s;hed to hear and determine all cau&s;es ari&s;ing within their Liberties; here likewi&s;e they had Authority, by Royall Conce&s;&s;ion, to make By-Laws and Ordinances, for the common good and profit of the Cinque Ports, and for the better Regulating (as the exigency of Affairs might &s;eem to exact) the Herring|fi&s;hing at <HI>Yarmouth;</HI> and that this Court in the power of it might appear to be the Coun|terpane of that great Original of Power, the high Court of Parliament, all appeals from the inferior and &s;ubordinate Courts of the Cinque Ports were tran&s;mitted and transfer'd to this of <HI>Shepway.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, the Barons of the Cinque Ports claim by inherent Cu&s;tome and Pre&s;cription, which is grown up and confirm'd by a tacite con&s;ent between them and the King, to &s;upport the four Staves of the Canopy that covers the Kings Head at his Coronation, and after to dine at the uppermo&s;t Table in the great Hall, on his right hand.</P>
<P>There are other Franchi&s;es and priviledges circum&s;crib'd within the Verge and Cir|cumference of the above-recite a Charter, as the taking cognizance of the A&s;&s;ize of Bread and Beer, and &s;ome others; which becau&s;e they are not of that importance or con&s;ideration as tho&s;e which before were rehear&s;ed, and moreover finding that they are calculated for the Meridian of many other Corporations be&s;ides that of the Cinque Ports, I have at pre&s;ent forbore any farther Recital of them.</P>
<P>Now if any one will enquire what the Cinque Ports were to act by way of recom|pence or retribution for the&s;e &s;o &s;olemn and &s;ignall Characters and Demon&s;trations of royal favour; To this I an&s;wer, That they were to find fifty and &s;even Ships at their own Charge, for the &s;pace of fifteen days, to attend the King when&s;oever he &s;hould pa&s;s the Seas; whereof <HI>Ha&s;ting</HI> was to find one and twenty, <HI>Sandwich</HI> five, <HI>Hieth</HI> five, <HI>Romney</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="13">five, and <HI>Dover</HI> one and twenty; each of which was to be furni&s;hed with one and twenty men, and a <HI>Garcion</HI> or Boy, the Ma&s;ters &s;tipend was to amount to 6^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Con&s;tables to a Sallary of the &s;ame value, and each vulgar Mariner was to have three pence <HI>per diem;</HI> and if the obligation of affairs &s;o requir'd it that they at|tended the King beyond the extent of fifteen days, then they were for the time fol|lowing to be &s;upported in their expences at the charge of the Crown. Now be|cau&s;e the wi&s;dome of after-times thought this too va&s;t and burden&s;ome an expence, to be &s;olely and wholly &s;u&s;tain'd by the Cinque-Ports, therefore there were &s;everal other Towns and Villges that lay &s;catter'd in the Body of this Nation, that were made Mem|bers and Limbs of the Cinque-Ports, and inve&s;ted and fortified with the &s;ame Im|munities and Liberties, that they might by con&s;equence be enwrapt and engag'd in the &s;ame common expence. The Names of tho&s;e which are &s;ituated in <HI>Kent</HI> are as followeth: <HI>viz. Sandwich</HI> had the Addition of <HI>Fordwich, Sarre, Ram&s;gate, Deal, Walmer,</HI> and <HI>Stonor. Dover</HI> had <HI>Fever&s;ham, Birchington,</HI> St. <HI>Johns,</HI> St. <HI>Peters, Ridlings|would,</HI> and <HI>Folkstone. Hieth</HI> had We&s;t-<HI>Hieth. Romney</HI> had old <HI>Romney, Lydde, Prom|hill, Dengemer&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Orwel&s;ton. Ha&s;tings</HI> and <HI>Winchel&s;ey</HI> had in <HI>Kent</HI> as their Appen|dages, <HI>Bekesbourn, Grench,</HI> and <HI>Tenterden.</HI> As a L'envoy to the Cinque-Ports, I &s;hall repre&s;ent a Summary, or Bedroll of all tho&s;e Per&s;ons of e&s;teem that have had the Ho|nour to have been dignified with the Title of Lord Wardens of the Cinque-Ports; which Scroll or Regi&s;ter I have collected out of an ancient Manu&s;cript, and are in their <HI>Series</HI> or Succe&s;&s;ion as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Egbert</HI> having thus broken the Kenti&s;h Forces, and inoculated the Scepter of <HI>Kent</HI> upon that of his own, the Title of King was for ever entomb'd in the Ruines and Tomb of the &s;laughter'd <HI>Baldred;</HI> nor was this County dignified with any Title at all, untill the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, and then that Prince created <HI>Godwin</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent;</HI> a man of &s;o low and ob&s;cure an extraction, that the concurrent Te|&s;timonie of all Authors does affirm he was <HI>Bubulci Filius,</HI> the &s;on of a Cowherd: yet notwith&s;tanding, he made him&s;elf &s;o con&s;iderable by his Eruptions on &s;everal parts of this I&s;land by Land, and his depredations by Sea, that our Engli&s;h &s;tory &s;wels with the rehear&s;al of his Acts of Deva&s;tation and Piracy. Now if you would know from whence the Latine word <HI>Comes</HI> deduces its original, that is, the <HI>Ge|nus</HI> both to the French word <HI>Count,</HI> and the Saxon word <HI>Earle</HI> or <HI>Eorlederman,</HI> (for that was the more antient term;) I &s;hall in a brief Model repre&s;ent it to you. The ma|king of <HI>Counts</HI> anciently, as is affirmed by <HI>Trebellius Pollio</HI> in the life of <HI>Macrianus,</HI> was in <HI>Contubernium Imperatoriae Maje&s;tatis ad&s;ci&s;cere,</HI> to take &s;ome &s;elect Per&s;ons into the Chamber and fellow&s;hip of the Imperial Maje&s;ty: that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had &s;ome &s;uch, is mo&s;t certain; for, <HI>Suetonius</HI> in his life mentions <HI>Comites Largitionum expeditionumque;</HI> who&s;e fir&s;t in&s;titution is by <HI>Seneca</HI> in his &s;ixth Book <HI>de Bene. Cap.</HI> 34. refer'd and a&s;crib'd to <HI>Gracchus</HI> and <HI>Livius Dru&s;us;</HI> they, &s;aith he, <HI>apud nos primum in&s;tituerunt &s;egregare Tur|bam &s;uam, &amp; alios in &s;ecretum recipere:</HI> and then again, <HI>Habuerunt itaque i&s;ti amicos pri|mos, habuerunt &amp; &s;ecundos;</HI> and it is recorded of <HI>Alexander Severus</HI> by <HI>Lampridius,</HI> that <HI>Amicos non &s;ol&ugrave;m primi ac &s;ecundi loci</HI> (which were certainly tho&s;e per&s;ons which he had &s;eparated from the vulgar ma&s;&s;e of men) <HI>&s;ed etiam inferiores aegrotantes vi&s;eret.</HI> And <HI>Tacitus</HI> in his Book de <HI>Bello Germanice</HI> relates, that the Prince had <HI>duodecem Co|mites,</HI> or twelve Companions a&s;&s;ign'd him, who tran&s;acted the great Affairs both of War and Peace; from which Model it is probable the 12 Peers of <HI>France</HI> had their fir&s;t original. In Ages of a lower &s;tep, the&s;e <HI>Comites</HI> were frequently call'd <HI>Reguli.</HI> In <HI>Can|tia,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Malmsbury, Omnis ju&s;titia laborabat &s;ub cuju&s;dam Gorongiregimine, qui tamen &s;i|cut omnes Reguli in&s;ulae Vortigerno &s;ub&s;ternebantur.</HI> Afterwards when <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> had e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
<PB N="15" REF="14">his Kenti&s;h Kingdome, the Title of Earl began to commence in <HI>Otho</HI> and <HI>Ebu|&s;a,</HI> Brothers to the above&s;aid <HI>Hengi&s;t,</HI> as the &s;ame <HI>Malmesbury</HI> ob&s;erves in his Tract <HI>de Ge&s;tis Regum Cap.</HI> 3. And the Title of Earl was anciently expre&s;&s;ed by the word <HI>Comes</HI> among&s;t the Saxons, for to King <HI>Ethelberts</HI> Charter for the foundation of the <HI>Abby</HI> of St. <HI>Augu&s;tins,</HI> cited by <HI>Reynerus,</HI> there are the&s;e &s;ub&s;criptions, <HI>Ego Hamigi|lus Dux laudavi,</HI> and then, <HI>Ego Ocea Comes con&s;en&s;i, Ego Graphio Comes benedixi;</HI> and there is an old Epitaph quoted by Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI> the &s;ub&s;tance of which is this; that <HI>Alwain</HI> which was Founder of <HI>Ram&s;ey-Abby,</HI> was <HI>Comes &amp; Al|dermannus totius Angliae:</HI> but in decur&s;ion of Time, this word <HI>Eolderman</HI> being u&s;ed by others be&s;ides tho&s;e to whom it was proper and analogical, it began to langui&s;h into di&s;u&s;e, and the Title of <HI>Thane</HI> and <HI>Earl</HI> was a&s;&s;umed, which la&s;t hath re|mained in force untill this day: Now the relief of a <HI>Thane</HI> (who was certainly an Earl by office, rather then Title) if he were of the fir&s;t rank, that is, had the cu&s;tody of &s;ome County under the King, which he paid to the Crown, was four Hor&s;es two &s;ad|led and two un&s;adled: two Swords, and four Spears, and as many Shields; And if he were of the &s;econd rank, he paid two Hor&s;es, one &s;adled and one un&s;adled, one Sword, two Lances, as many Shields, and fifty Marks in Silver; &s;ometimes, if he were a <HI>Thane</HI> of an inferior rank, he paid eight-pound, and frequently three-pound. The relief which an Earl paid con&s;tantly to the Crown after the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t was (as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI> does demon&s;trate out of &s;everall Records) was an Hundred pound.</P>
<P>Now the benefit which did accrue to the <HI>Count</HI> or <HI>Earl,</HI> be&s;ides a Barren and na|ked Title to &s;upport the dignity of his Per&s;on in its due Magnificence and Splen|dor, was the third penny ari&s;ing out of the Profits of the County. <HI>Algar</HI> Earl of <HI>Merc|land</HI> (as <HI>Dooms-day</HI> Book informs us) had the third penny of the County of <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> and the Borough of <HI>Stafford</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or. And <HI>Mawde</HI> the Em|pre&s;&s;e when &s;he created <HI>Milo</HI> Earl of <HI>Hereford,</HI> a&s;&s;igned to him for the &s;upport of his Honor, the third penny of that County: Many examples of the like condition are di&s;coverable in Mr. <HI>Selden's Titles of Honour,</HI> whither I refer the Reader. And as they had the third penny, &s;o they had frequently the Ca&s;tle of the County annexed to their Title, but when by experience the Kings of <HI>England</HI> were in&s;tructed how fatally per|nicious it was to have &s;o many local powers concurrent with theirs, that by the &s;trength of their retreat, and the number of confederates and Parti&s;ans, &s;eem'd even to out|poi&s;e the Royal Authority, it was by a Statute made in the 13^t^h^. year of <HI>Richard</HI> the 2^d^. for the future interdicted and prohibited.</P>
<P>Now if you will enquire when Earls or Counts from being ab&s;olute became Feu|dal, Sr. <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> in his <HI>Glo&s;&s;arie</HI> will tell you that it was <HI>Tempore Othonum, &amp; &s;ub exce&s;&s;u Merovinae &s;tirpis in Galli&acirc;,</HI> that is, about the year onet hou&s;and.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the En&s;igns of Inve&s;titure, with which the Earl was created, it was anciently only with the Cincture of a Sword, but about the latter end of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the fir&s;t, the Coronet began to be in u&s;e, for <HI>Aymer de Vallence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrook</HI> who died in the 16^t^h^. year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2^d^. had one, as appears by an in&s;trument of <HI>William de Lavenham,</HI> cited by Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> in his <HI>Titles of Honour,</HI> by which he acknowledges the receit of it from Sr. <HI>Henry Stacheden</HI> in the 12^t^h^. year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 2^d^. <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> died in the 49^t^h^. year of <HI>Edward</HI> the 3^d^. and by his la&s;t Will dated the fifth of <HI>December,</HI> gives his Noble&s;t and Riche&s;t Coronet to his Son the Lord <HI>Richard Fitz-allan,</HI> his &s;econd to the Lady <HI>Joan</HI> his elde&s;t, and the 3^d^. he be|queaths to the Lady <HI>Alice</HI> his younge&s;t Daughter.</P>
<P>What the <HI>Counts Palatine</HI> were I &s;hall now demon&s;trate: they were taken immedi|ately <HI>&agrave; Palatio,</HI> from whence they a&s;&s;um'd their name; and were cu&s;tomarily &s;uch as had the neare&s;t relation to the Prince, either by friend&s;hip or Affinity, and to who&s;e care and admini&s;tration, he did entru&s;t &s;uch or &s;uch a Province; and the more to improve and enable them in the di&s;charge of their Duty, did unite &s;ome pri|vileges and Franchi&s;es to their office; as erecting Courts of Judicature, appointing Judges to &s;it in them, and determine by &s;ignal deci&s;ion upon cau&s;es both Criminal and Civil, and others of the like nature, that were of that luxutiant latitude, that they had the Stamp and Character of &s;omething which re&s;embled Regality fixt upon them. He that will di&s;cover by example more of this honorary Title may read Mr. <HI>Sel|dens
<PB N="16" REF="15">Titles of Honor</HI> whither, to decline all &s;uperfluity of di&s;cour&s;e, I refer to the Reader.</P>
<P>I have now done with the Title, I &s;hall now proceed to unwind the Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e who were Earls of <HI>Kent</HI> &s;ub&s;equent to Earl <HI>Godwin.</HI></P>

<P>Having repre&s;ented in Pro&s;pect the <HI>Comites</HI> and <HI>Con&s;ules,</HI> the Earls and Con&s;uls which were originally to manage tho&s;e Provinces &s;ubordinate to the Romane Go|vernment; I &s;hall now take cogni&s;ance of tho&s;e which were anciently &s;tyl'd <HI>Vice Co|mites &amp; Procon&s;ules,</HI> and had care of the Provincial revenue (in relation to which they were term'd <HI>Que&s;tores Provinciarum</HI>) and the juri&s;diction of &s;ome Cau&s;es only (as our Sheriffs have of divers Actions <HI>Vi&s;contiel</HI>) and inquiry of Cau&s;es Criminal, but not determination of them. In the Saxon times they were &s;ometimes call'd <HI>Ealdor|men,</HI> and in Latine <HI>Vice Comites,</HI> which was applyed to them, not as they were &s;ub|&s;ervient to the Earl, but as they admini&s;tered ju&s;tice when he was either dead or ab&s;ent. 'Tis true, if we di&s;&s;ect the word <HI>Earldom,</HI> we &s;hall di&s;cover the la&s;t &s;yllable: <HI>Dome</HI> is deduc'd from <HI>Dominion,</HI> and implies that the Mar&s;hal and Civil Government be|ing anciently &s;ubordinate to Counts and Earls, there was &s;ome Analogy and re|&s;emblance in the Official Dignity of an Earl, and a Sheriff, and certainly the word <HI>Sheriff</HI> imports no le&s;&s;e, a word contracted from the Saxon word <HI>Schyregereve,</HI> or <HI>Schyregrave.</HI></P>
<P>The word is be&s;t interpreted by the Laws, intituled <HI>the Confe&s;&s;ors,</HI> where we read thus, <HI>Sicut modo vocantur Greves qui &s;uper, alios Praefecturas habent ita apud Anglos anti|quit&ucirc;s vocabantur EALDORMEN, qua&s;i &s;eniores non propter Senectutem cum qui|dem adole&s;centes e&s;&s;ent &s;ed propter &s;apientiam:</HI> they were call'd anciently <HI>EALDOR|MEN,</HI> &s;ay tho&s;e Laws, not in re&s;pect of years, but wi&s;dome. And we find <HI>Henry</HI> the 3^d^. made his Son Prince <HI>Edward</HI> the five la&s;t years of his Reign, Sheriff of <HI>Bedford</HI> and <HI>Buckingham.</HI> The black Prince was often Sheriff of <HI>Cornwall</HI> under <HI>Edward</HI> the 3^d^. And Prince <HI>Henry</HI> in the life of his Father <HI>Henry</HI> the 4^t^h^. is found to have been Sheriff of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and it was done by the&s;e Sagacious Princes, with this intent, that their Sons, when they &s;hould a&s;cend the Throne, might be more dexterous in the Cour&s;e and Conduct of the revenue of the Crown. And as the&s;e Princes were inve|&s;ted with this Office, &s;o we find both Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Abbots, Earls, and Ba|rons held this Dignity; nay, &s;ometimes Queens and Counte&s;&s;es, Dowagers too, with an allowance of a Shire-Clerk, which after re&s;olv'd into him, we call the under-Sheriff. And it was u&s;ual long &s;ince, as the Statute-Law now likewi&s;e a&s;&s;erts it, that the <HI>Cen|&s;us</HI> or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome <HI>Demea&s;ne</HI> in the County, admits a capacity to hold the office, and an&s;wer the King the Profits of the County; otherwi&s;e, they are illegal
<PB N="17" REF="15">and lyable to exception; and in this re&s;pect, &s;ometime the King committed four Counties to one man, if he were po&s;&s;e&s;t of Lands in them all, as <HI>Hubert de Burgo</HI> was at one time Sheriff of <HI>Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> and was allow'd a meet per&s;on to be his Sub&s;titute or Shire-Clerk in the ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P>If any &s;hall demand how long there have been Sheriffs under this quallified No|tion, as I have before repre&s;ented and pourtray'd them, I mu&s;t remit them to King <HI>Alfred</HI> the Founder of <HI>Englands</HI> peace, and the divider of it into Shires and Pro|vinces; not to <HI>Gervas</HI> of <HI>Tilbury,</HI> who&s;e definition of the Name is very deficient, making the office meerly &s;uppletory to the Count or Earl, nor to <HI>Polidore Virgil,</HI> who being by birth an <HI>Alien,</HI> would obtrude a fal&s;e opinion upon us, that the offi|ces of the Chancellors and Sheriffs were in&s;tituted &s;ince the <HI>Norman</HI> Conque&s;t; For evidence to the confutation of him, we may read the Te&s;timonies remembred by the mo&s;t learned <HI>Selden,</HI> in the &s;ub&s;cription of King <HI>Edreds</HI> Charter, to the Abby of <HI>Crow|land</HI> there after Abbots, Dukes and Counts follow, <HI>Ego Afor vice Comes audivi.</HI> &cross; And in another Saxon Charter, to the &s;ame Abby there is this clau&s;e in&s;erted, <HI>Ego Livingus Clericus i&s;tud Chirographum manu me&acirc; &s;ub&s;crip&s;i, &amp; Domino meo Theroldo tra|didi;</HI> which Records do indi&s;putably, I think &s;ubvert his A&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>The next Annotation upon our procon&s;ulary Officer, is the continuation of tho&s;e that in elder time held it many years together; as for example, the <HI>Cornhills</HI> did in <HI>Kent,</HI> whereby their own Sirname was di&s;continued, and the officiary Name <HI>le Sheriff, &amp; le Vi&s;count</HI> &s;wallowed up the other, and the relict of Reginald <HI>(de Cornhill) le Vi&s;count,</HI> in a Conce&s;&s;ion of Land to the Chappel of <HI>Lukedale</HI> in <HI>Littlebourn,</HI> is &s;tyl'd in the Latine In&s;trument <HI>Vice Comiti&s;&s;a Cantii,</HI> and a Mannor of his in <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Thanet,</HI> has from this Sirname obtain'd the Title of the Sheriffs Court. But when it was found inconvenient for one man to hold the place any long time, in regard of his Account, and other enormities emergent; provi&s;ion was made by Statute that none &s;hould &s;erve two years together, but &s;hould be two years at lea&s;t deve&s;ted of the Office ere he &s;erved again in the &s;ame County.</P>
<P>Touching the Sheriffs Letters of attendance, injoyning all Arch-Bi&s;hops, Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;counts, Bi&s;hops, Barons, &amp;c. to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, it &s;hews in <HI>Lankskip</HI> and <HI>Per&s;pective</HI> afar off, the Latitude anciently of his authority; but &s;ince the in&s;titution of Lords-Lieutenants, the Beams of his power have &s;hone forth with a more dim and contracted light: So much &s;hall &s;uffice for the explication of its Name, as it is Officiary. Now a word or two how it became Honorary, becau&s;e as from the Con|&s;ul or Count, Time and Royal Authority hath extracted the Princely Dignity of Earl, which being for the mo&s;t part en&s;tated in elder times on the Kings kindred, hath cau&s;ed the u&s;e of that addition ever &s;ince to all of that rank: So likewi&s;e the State and Degree of a <HI>Vicount,</HI> hath a participation of that Attribute, and are call'd Cou&s;en by the Soveraign, and in the Scrutiny made by the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter at every Fea&s;t of St. <HI>George,</HI> during the time of <HI>Ve&s;pers,</HI> if there were any &s;tall void; A <HI>Vi&s;count</HI> is admitted as the lowe&s;t degree of Princes. The fir&s;t that under this Ti|tle had Parliamentary Dignity and Precedency of all Barons with us, was <HI>John de Beaumont</HI> created <HI>Vi&s;count-Beaumont</HI> in the 18^t^h^. year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth without any re|lation to the Office.

<P>I &s;hall now take a Pro&s;pect of all the Pari&s;hes, Villages, and Mannors, which are circum&s;cribed, within the circle of this County; but before I wade farther in this Di&s;cour&s;e, I &s;hall repre&s;ent upon what rea&s;ons or foundations Mannors were fir&s;t in|&s;tituted and e&s;tabli&s;hed, by example and re&s;emblance of the King's policy in the in|&s;titutions of Tenures, (&s;aith Sir <HI>Francis Bacon:</HI>) The great men and Gentlemen of this Realm did the like, &s;o near as they could; as for Example, when the King had given to any of them two thou&s;and Acres of Lands, this party propo&s;ing in this place to make his Dwelling, or (as the old word is) his Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, or his Man|nor-hou&s;e, did devi&s;e how he might make his Land a compleat Habitation to &s;upply him with all manner of nece&s;&s;aries; and for that purpo&s;e, he would give of the utter|mo&s;t parts of the&s;e two thou&s;ands Acres, one hundred, or two hundred Acres, or more or le&s;s, as he &s;hould think meet, to one of his mo&s;t tru&s;ty Servants, with &s;ome re&s;erva|tion of rent to find a hor&s;e for the wars, and go with him when he went with the King to the wars, adding vow of Homage, and the oath of Fealty, Ward&s;hip, Marriage and Relief. This Relief is to pay five pounds for every Knights Fee, or after the rate for more or le&s;s at the entrance of every Heir: which Tenant &s;o created and placed, was, and is to this day called a Tennant by Knights Service, and not by his own per&s;on; but of his Mannors, of the&s;e he might make as many as he would; then this Lord would provide that the Land which he was to keep for his own u&s;e, &s;hould be plowed, and his harve&s;t brought home his Hou&s;e required, his Park pailed, and the like; and for that end he would give to &s;undry other of twenty, thirty, forty or fifty Acres; re|&s;erving the &s;ervice of plowing a certain quantity, or &s;o many dayes of his Lands, and certain Harve&s;t works, or dayes in the Harve&s;t to labour, or to repair the Hou&s;e, Park, Pail, or otherwi&s;e; or to give him for his provi&s;ion, Capons, Hens, Pepper, Commin, Ro&s;es, Gilliflowers, Spurs, Gloves, or the like; or to pay him a certain Rent, and to be &s;worn to be his faithful Tenant, which Tenure was called a Soccage Tenure, and is &s;o to this day; howbeit, mo&s;t of the plowing, and Harve&s;t &s;ervices are turned into Money Rents: the Tenants in Soccage at the Death of every Tenant, were to pay Relief, which was not as Knights Service is, five pound a Knights Fee; but it was and is &s;till one years Rent of the Land, and no Ward&s;hip or other profit to the Lord. The remainder of the two thou&s;and Acres he kept to him&s;elf, whith he u&s;ed to ma|nure by his Bondman, and appointed them at the Courts of his Mannor how they &s;hould hold it, making an Entry of it into the Roll of the Remembrances of the Acts of his Court; yet &s;till in the Lords power to take it away, and therefore they were called

<P><HI>Addington</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkfield,</HI> was as high as any Track of Evidence can tran&s;port me to di&s;cover, the Inheritance of a noble Family called <HI>Mandeville,</HI> and divers Deeds of a very venerable Antiquity, being without date, and now in the hands of Mr. <HI>Watton,</HI> do atte&s;t <HI>Roger de Mandeville</HI> in tho&s;e elder Times to have been Lord of the Fee; but before the end of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, this Family was vani&s;hed, and had &s;urrendred the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place to <HI>Robert At Checquer,</HI> in whom the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was but of a narrow Date, for hee not long after alienated his Intere&s;t in it to <HI>Nicholas Dagworth,</HI> as is evident by this Record regi&s;tred in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> kept in the <HI>Exchequer, De Nicholao de Dagworth pro uno Feodo Militis, quod Roberius de Scaccario. tenuit in Addington de Warreno de Montecani&s;io</HI> 40. s.

<P><HI>Dean Court</HI> in this Pari&s;h was the Man&s;ion of a Family who borrowed their Sir|name from this Town, and were called <HI>Apledore,</HI> and &s;ealed with a Pile &s;urmounted with a Fe&s;&s;e, which was their paternal Coat, but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir, for <HI>Thomas de Apledore,</HI> dying witout I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Elnith</HI> his only Si&s;ter entituled her husband <HI>William Roper</HI> to his E&s;tate here, and in the confining Mar&s;h; and by an uninterrupted Right derived from this Alliance, hath the title of this place been &s;upported in the Family of <HI>Roper,</HI> for &s;o many De&s;cents, that it is now at la&s;t devolved to the right honorable <HI>Chri&s;topher Roper</HI> Baron of <HI>Tenham,</HI> in whom it is at this in&s;tant re&s;ident.</P>

<P>The Rectory of <HI>Brenchley</HI> was given by <HI>Richard de Clare</HI> to the Canons of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and compounded with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> with this Provi&s;ion re&s;erved, that the Rector for the Time being &s;hould pay two wax Tapers of four pound Weight to the Priory of <HI>Tunbridge</HI> at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen.</HI> The Mannor which was annexed to this Rectory, was upon the Di&s;&s;olution of this Cloi&s;ter in the thirty fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth granted to <HI>Paul Sidnor,</HI> and he not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>William Waller</HI> E&s;quire, from which Family not many years &s;ince it was by Purcha&s;e inve&s;ted in the Family of <HI>Courthop.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Moatlands</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family who extracted their Sirname from hence, and were called <HI>Brenchley,</HI> a Branch of which was Sir <HI>William Brenchley</HI> Lord Cheif Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, who founded a Chauntry or Chappel in the Navy of the Cathedral at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and dyed in the year 1446 without I&s;&s;ue; nor did the&s;e Lands continue much longer in the Name, for in the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth I find them in the Tenure of <HI>More,</HI> who had matched with the Heir Generall, and here the Propriety of this place remained interwoven, with the Inheritance of this Family untill that Age which fell under our Fathers Remembrance, and then it

<P>There are two other Seats in this Pari&s;h, which may de&s;erve our notice; the fir&s;t is <HI>Cats-Place,</HI> which gave Seat to <HI>Hugh de Cat,</HI> and in Recompence took its Denomination from him, and after the Title of it had lodged in this Name many De&s;cents, even until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Tilden,</HI> of <HI>Tildens Place</HI> in <HI>Marden;</HI> and after the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had &s;ome Ages been united to their Intere&s;t, it was &s;ome few years &s;ince unfa&s;tned, and the Propriety of it carried over to <HI>Ba&s;&s;age.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Vanes,</HI> which yielded both Seat and Sirname to as Illu&s;trious a Family as any in this Track, <HI>Robert Vane</HI> or <HI>Fane</HI> (for they are proimi&s;cuou&s;ly &s;o written in ancient Rolls) paid re&s;pective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and is from him by a continued Series &s;till tran&s;ported along in the Demea&s;n of this Name and Family; &s;o that here (if my Light fail me not) &s;hould I look for the original of that Noble Name and Family, that &s;ince hath &s;o fairly &s;pread into &s;o many &s;everal Branches i&s;&s;ued primitively from this fir&s;t original Stem.</P>

<P>There is a place in this Pari&s;h called <HI>Mans,</HI> as being in elder Times a Man&s;ion of that Name, as Deeds both of an ancient and modern Date do inform me, which whether it were the ancient Seat of the <HI>Mans,</HI> who have &s;ince been tran&s;planted to <HI>Canterbury,</HI> is un|certain; onely it is very probable, becau&s;e it had Proprietaries of that Denomination, that this was the Fountain whence this Family i&s;&s;ued forth.</P>

<PB N="81" REF="47">year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, but for two Knights Fees and an half; from all which reci|ted pa&s;&s;ages is evinced that this Title of Baronage flowed only from the Favour and Indulgence of the Prince, who by his Writ or Summons called tho&s;e who had meri|ted well by &s;ome worthy undertakings to this Dignity and Title, and not from the va&s;tne&s;s of their Patrimony, though this did very much concurre afterwards to &s;up|port their Baronage in its true Value and Lu&s;tre.

<P><HI>Challock</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill</HI> hath two places in it, which may de&s;ervedly come within the Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e Mannors which are in this Survey to be recorded: The fir&s;t is <HI>Otterpley,</HI> which was an eminent Seat belonging to the ancient Family of <HI>Apulderfield.</HI> The fir&s;t that I find of Note in any publick Record to have po&s;&s;e&s;t it, was <HI>Henry de Apulderfield,</HI> who had the Grant of a Market and Fayre to his Mannor of <HI>Apulderfield</HI> in <HI>Coldham,</HI> in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Hen.</HI> the third; and this mans great Grandchild <HI>Henry de Apulderfield</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the fiftieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Challock.</HI> His Hou&s;e was near <HI>Ea&s;t-well</HI> in the Earl of <HI>Winchel|&s;eys</HI> upper Park, called <HI>Apulderfields Garden,</HI> which is now &s;o ob&s;cured in its own Ruins, that we now with Difficulty trace out its Sepulcher, made up of its own complicated Rubbi&s;h; but this Mannor, as to &s;ome Proportion of it, was pa&s;&s;ed away before he was Sheriff, to <HI>Edmund de Hant,</HI> who held it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; but neither of the&s;e Families la&s;ted longer then the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd; for then I find it entirely inve&s;ted in <HI>Richard</HI> Lord <HI>Poynings,</HI> who in the eleventh year of that Prince was po&s;&s;e&s;t of it at his Death, and left it to his Sole Heir, <HI>Eleanor</HI> matched to <HI>Henry Percy</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> in who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors the Right was con&s;tantly fixed, until the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed by <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney, William Wal&s;ingham,</HI> and <HI>William Fitz-Williams,</HI> and they immediately after re-conveyed it to Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Hales,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>James Hales</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth alienated it to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> by who&s;e Daughter and Co|heir <HI>Katharine,</HI> it came to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> unhappily Ship|wract by <HI>New-Haven</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> a Per&s;on who de&s;erved a longer Life, and not &s;o dark a Fate; from whom by paternal De&s;cent it is now tran&s;mitted to the right honourable <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> now Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Loringden</HI> and <HI>Deane</HI> are places in <HI>Challock</HI> worthy of Con&s;ideration. There is a Tradition very frequent among&s;t the Country people in this Track, that <HI>Loringden</HI> now altogether de&s;olate and full of &s;olitude, was once the Man&s;ion of Gentlemen of this Name, one of which &s;hould have waged Combate with one of the <HI>Apulderfields</HI> of <HI>Otterpley</HI> not far di&s;tant, about building a Chappel in the Valley, which was pretended by <HI>Loringden</HI> to be erected on Land that was of his Fee-&s;imple; but becau&s;e this without &s;ome more &s;olid Foundation to &s;upport then Fame and Vulgar Report, will appear but legend, I will re-pre&s;ent to you what the original Muniments and Evidences have di&s;covered to me in Relation to tho&s;e who were Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this place. That there was a Family which bore the Name of <HI>Lourdingden</HI> or <HI>Loringden,</HI> is mo&s;t certain, for there is a place in <HI>Challock</HI> which yet continues the Name of <HI>Lo|rindens Fore&s;tal;</HI> but when I con&s;ulted the private Evidences of this place, I found upon a &s;erious Di&s;quition they reached no higher then <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in his
<PB N="98" REF="56">Reign, it acknowledged it &s;elf to be of the Propriety of <HI>Cadman,</HI> a Family grown into a reverend e&s;teem by a long Pre&s;cription in this Track; but the Name of <HI>Dean</HI> con|tinued in being till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and was in very ancient Deeds, &s;ome of which are not limited with any Date, written <HI>At Dean</HI> and <HI>A Dean,</HI> and in that Princes Reign was by Sale pa&s;&s;ed away to the above mentioned Family of <HI>Cadman;</HI> in which Name both <HI>Loringdean</HI> and <HI>Dean</HI> remained clap&s;ed up, till the entrance of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then by a Sole Daughter and Heir they went over to <HI>Plomer,</HI> who almo&s;t in our Memory transferred his Right in both of them by Sale to <HI>Peirce.</HI></P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Challock</HI> being fallen down, was new erected by the <HI>Apulderfields,</HI> as the Gla&s;s windows and Stone work in divers places, embroider'd and diaper'd with the <HI>Voided Cro&s;s,</HI> which was their paternal Coat Armour, do more then &s;ufficiently te&s;tifie.</P>
<P><HI>Cranebrook</HI> gives name to the Hundred wherein it is &s;eated, a Town very po|pulous, in re&s;pect it was one of the fir&s;t places where the Manufacture of Clothing was profe&s;&s;ed and practi&s;ed, being brought into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Edward</HI> the thirds Reign, who by propo&s;ing rewards, and granting many Immunities, trained <HI>Flemings</HI> into this Nation in the tenth year of his reign, to teach the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that Art of Draperie, or Weaving and making woollen Cloth, which is e&s;teemed at this day, one of the Buttere&s;&s;e which &s;u&s;tains the Common-wealth; and certainly for making durable Broad clothes with very good Mixtures and perfect Colours, <HI>Cranebrook</HI> doth with the mo&s;t that way excell.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place of note in it, which obviates the eye, is <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t;</HI> but more properly and truly written <HI>Saxenhur&s;t;</HI> and as <HI>Bittenden,</HI> not far di&s;tant derives its Name from the <HI>Brittons,</HI> &s;o in mo&s;t probability did this take and a&s;&s;ume its Denomination from the <HI>Saxons.</HI> In <HI>Te&s;ta de Nevil,</HI> a Book kept in the Exchequer, which is a memorial of tho&s;e who holding their Lands in the Knights Service paid relief in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> third, towards the Marriage of the Kings Si&s;ter. There is mention of <HI>John de Saxenhur&s;t</HI> who was taxed for his Lands here at <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> which certain|ly was this <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t,</HI> with the two little Mannors of <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone;</HI> which had al|wayes the &s;ame Owners with <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t:</HI> In times of a more modern Character, the <HI>Berhams</HI> by the Female Heirs of <HI>Saxenhur&s;t</HI> were Lords of <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t,</HI> with its two adjuncts <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone; Richard de Berham</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third was here re&s;ident, and is written of this place; and <HI>Henry de Berham</HI> this mans Father paid re&s;pective Aid at the making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, for &s;undry parcels of Land which he held in <HI>Kent,</HI> and among&s;t the re&s;t, for his Lands at <HI>Cranebrook;</HI> and in this Family was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, with that of <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone</HI> concentered till the lat|ter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and then part of <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t</HI> with <HI>Copton</HI> and <HI>Stone</HI> was &s;old to Mr. <HI>Tho. Baker</HI> Father to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Attorney General, and of the Privy Coun&s;el to Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and likewi&s;e Chancellor of the Exchequer, and under-Trea|&s;urer, who purcha&s;ed the re&s;idue, and rai&s;ed that Magnificent Pile within the Park, which now charmes with &s;o much Delight the eyes of the Spectators; and from this man by the channel of paternal and lineal De&s;cent is the Inheritance of <HI>Si&s;ing|her&s;t, Copton,</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> emptied into Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, the in&s;tant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Gla&s;tenbury</HI> is not to be forgotten, &s;ince it is of &s;o great a Name el&s;ewhere, and is called as the other is from <HI>Gla&s;tney</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> Idiome of <HI>Inis Witrin,</HI> the Watry or Gla&s;&s;ie place. The Hou&s;e which &s;tands in a Park is moated about, and hath been for many Generations the capital Man&s;ion of the ancient Family of <HI>Rokchur&s;t,</HI> ever &s;ince <HI>Stephen Rokehur&s;t</HI> or <HI>Roberts</HI> of <HI>Curte&s;den,</HI> and in old Records &s;ometimes written <HI>Rokehur&s;t Den</HI> in <HI>Goudher&s;t,</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth married <HI>Joan</HI> Sole Heir of <HI>William Tilley</HI> of <HI>Gla&s;tenbury,</HI> (who&s;e Ance&s;tors had flouri&s;hed at this place, as private Evidencs in&s;truct me, ever &s;ince the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t) and in right of that Alliance became Lord of this Man&s;ion. This <HI>Stephen Roberts, ali&agrave;s Rokehur&s;t,</HI> was Grand-child of <HI>William Roberts, ali&agrave;s Rokehur&s;t,</HI> and that <HI>William</HI> was great Grand-child of <HI>William de Rokehur&s;t,</HI> who in the reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conque|rour, as the Evidences of this Family inform me, came out of <HI>Anandale</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> in|to
<PB N="99" REF="56"><HI>England;</HI> and to pre&s;erve the memory of this man, did the Family till the Govern|ment of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, write <HI>Roberts alias Rokchur&s;t,</HI> till in the Ea&s;t window of the North Chancel of the Church of <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> which was built by <HI>Walur Roberts</HI> E&s;q; in that Princes Reign, as al&s;o in mo&s;t of his Deeds and Conveyences the <HI>alias</HI> was left out.</P>
<P><HI>Cour&s;ehorne</HI> finds place to be remembred in the Map of <HI>Kent,</HI> and then mu&s;t not be forgotten here; it hath been for above three hundred years (as appears by private Records) the Inheritance of <HI>Henley,</HI> in an E&s;cheat Roll taken in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and marked with the number 92. After the death of <HI>Richard Haudloe,</HI> who it &s;eems had Lands at <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> there is mention of one <HI>Gerva; Henley</HI> that was one of the Jury and concerned in the Inqui&s;ition: But that which much improves the Fame of this Man&s;ion, is, that it was the Cradle of Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Serjeant at Law, a man of eminent repute in this County in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and by his three Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> married to ....... <HI>Waller</HI> of <HI>Grome-bridge, Hellen</HI> fir&s;t matched to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgbury,</HI> &s;econdly to Sir <HI>George Somer&s;ett,</HI> and thirdly to <HI>Thomas Vane</HI> of <HI>Bur&s;ton;</HI> and la&s;tly <HI>Ann</HI> wedded to <HI>Richard Covert</HI> of <HI>Slaugham</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> knit tho&s;e Noble Families together in one Alli|ance, but <HI>Cour&s;ehorne</HI> did by De&s;cent come over to his Brother <HI>Gervas Henley</HI> E&s;quire, from whom Sir <HI>Thomas Henley</HI> now of <HI>Cour&s;ehorne</HI> is lineally extracted.</P>
<P>Another ancient place there is in <HI>Cranebrook,</HI> called <HI>Hartridge,</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in times pa&s;t of a worthy Family of that Sirname, among them chiefly to be remembred is <HI>Thomas Hartridge,</HI> for he was one of the Con&s;ervators or Ju&s;tices of Peace in this County in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, when there was but eight only in the whole Shire. It hath been &s;ince much honoured by the <HI>Will fords,</HI> who by <HI>James Willsford</HI> a mo&s;t worthy Senator of <HI>London,</HI> derive them&s;elves from the right ancient Family of <HI>Willsford</HI> of <HI>Willsford</HI> in <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> and are fairly &s;pread from hence into many Branches both in this County, and el&s;ewhere; and after it had thus for divers De&s;cents been re&s;ident in this noble Family, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was in our Fathers remem|brance united by purcha&s;e to the Patrimony of <HI>Tindall,</HI> now of <HI>Sutton Valence.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly <HI>Betenham</HI> is not to be pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, which is a Note worthy Place in this Pari&s;h, that gave both Seat and Sirname to the <HI>Betenhams,</HI> but when the elde&s;t Line had only three Daughters and Coheirs, matched to <HI>More, Dering,</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;her,</HI> who divided the Patrimony, this in his Wifes right was annexed to the Demea&s;n of <HI>More,</HI> and this after <HI>More</HI> had alienated his Intere&s;t in it, came to acknowledge for Sole Owners the <HI>Roes,</HI> of which Family was the right Noble Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> Knight, Chan|cellor of the mo&s;t Noble Order of the Garter, and of the Privy Councel to the late Kidg <HI>Charles,</HI> and &s;everall years Emba&s;&s;ador to the Great <HI>Mogor,</HI> Great <HI>Turk,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and la&s;tly to the Princes of the Prote&s;tant Union in <HI>Germany,</HI> in the year 1642. After which Negotiation mo&s;t prudently tran&s;facted, he returned, and died; but in this Family it remained not long, for in the remembrance of that Age our Fathers lived in, it was by Sale demi&s;ed to <HI>Mansfield,</HI> in whom the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is at this pre|&s;ent &s;etled.</P>
<P>There are two places more which may be regi&s;tred in this Inventorie. The fir&s;t is <HI>Plechinghur&s;t,</HI> which was an ancient Seat belonging to the <HI>Sharpeighs</HI> of <HI>Sharpeigh,</HI> a Family of deep rooted Antiquitie in this Track; <HI>Robert de Sharpeigh</HI> flouri&s;hed here at <HI>Cranebrook</HI> about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and was witne&s;s to a Deed of <HI>William de Brindens</HI> of <HI>Brinden:</HI> In this Pari&s;h formerly the <HI>Linds,</HI> and now the <HI>Hol|dens;</HI> but this Deed is without Date: another <HI>Robert Sharpeigh</HI> of <HI>Sharpeigh</HI> and <HI>Crane|brook,</HI> as I find by an ancient Roll was in Commi&s;&s;ion as Ju&s;tice of the Peace about the latter end of the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh: But as all &s;ublunary things are cru&s;hed and overturned by the wheel of an incon&s;tant Vici&s;&s;itude, &s;o by Con&s;e|quence are our Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions likewi&s;e; for, after this place had been for &s;o many De&s;cents the Inheritance of this ancient Family, it was almo&s;t within the Verge of our Re|membrance, fir&s;t alienated to <HI>Martin,</HI> and by him not long &s;ince by Sale de|mi&s;ed to <HI>Walter.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Buckhur&s;t,</HI> which is the la&s;t place of Account within the circuit of this Pari&s;h. If we go to trace the Antiquity of th&s;e Families, who were the ancient Proprietorrs of it, we &s;hall find that it acknowledged <HI>Hadloe</HI> and <HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI> for its elder
<PB N="100" REF="57">Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, that the fir&s;t had &s;ome concernment here, not only the private Deeds and Muniments of this place do evince to us, but likewi&s;e by an Inqui&s;ition taken after the decea&s;e of <HI>Richard de Hadloe,</HI> by which it is evident he held &s;ome E&s;tate here in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 32. And that the &s;econd Family had &s;ome Intere&s;t here, not only the Authority above&s;aid doth ju&s;tifie, but the Name it &s;elf doth tacitly in&s;inuate that this Man&s;ion formerly gave Seat and De|nomination to the Family of <HI>Buckhur&s;t;</HI> in times of a lower &s;tep, that is, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, I find it in the Tenure of <HI>Drayner;</HI> but how it devolved to this Family, I cannot di&s;cover; It is enough that it continued united to their Dimea&s;n, untill the beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to <HI>Alexander Coach|man,</HI> in who&s;e De&s;cendant the Signorie and Intere&s;t of it hath ever &s;ince been con|&s;tantly re&s;ident.</P>
<P><HI>Cranebroke</HI> had the Grant of a Market to be ob&s;erved weekly there on the <HI>Saturday,</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, as appears <HI>Cart. Edw.</HI> 1. <HI>Num.</HI> 92.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to tell you that there is a place in this Pari&s;h called <HI>Holden,</HI> which with <HI>Hawkeridge</HI> hath for &s;ome Centuries of years acknowledged the <HI>Holdens</HI> for its Proprietaries, and are &s;till united to the Patrimony of this Name and Family, which for &s;uch a va&s;t Succe&s;&s;ion of time hath been planted at <HI>Cranebroke.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Chappell at a place called <HI>Milkhou&s;e,</HI> in the Ea&s;tern part of this Pari&s;h founded and endowed by <HI>John Lawle&s;s,</HI> about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, which upon the generall Di&s;&s;olation of Chantries and all other Religious Fraternities by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was by that Prince about the latter end of his Rule granted to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t</HI> not far di&s;tant, who&s;e Revenue is yet in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>There was another Chappell founded at <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t</HI> (as the Evidences of that place do in&s;inuate) by <HI>John de Saxenhur&s;t;</HI> which was reedified by the late Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> and by a Deed delivered to <HI>John Bancroft</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Oxford</HI> devoted to the Service of God, and dedicated as it was before to St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;t:</HI> After the reception of this In&s;trument, which was in the year 1637. it was by the &s;ame Bi&s;hop Con&s;ecrated; fir&s;t, by a Prayer at the entrance of the Chappell, then by others made at the Seats, Pulpit, and Communion Table; the effect of all which was, that God would accept of it for a Hou&s;e, and likewi&s;e of the Prayers and Devotions that in that Oratorie were offered up by the faithful People of God to his Honour and Service.</P>
<P><HI>Charing</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill,</HI> is in <HI>Saxon</HI> written <HI>Cering,</HI> and by that Name King <HI>Kenulf</HI> in the year 799. made Re&s;titution of it to <HI>Chri&s;t Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> at the humble reque&s;t of Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Athelard,</HI> for King <HI>Offa</HI> had taken it away from that Church in the time of Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Janibert;</HI> and being thus regained to the See, it continued &s;o till the great Exchange made in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth with that Prince by Arch-Bi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer;</HI> the Fee-&s;imple was planted in the Crown: In the time of the Conque&s;t in the Notitia of the Arch-Bi&s;hop and Cathe|drals Lands, becau&s;e they held it in ancient Demea&s;n (that is, they had po&s;&s;e&s;t it long before the Conque&s;t) and a Mannor-hou&s;e or Palace there, it was called <HI>Proprium Manerium Archiepi&s;copi.</HI> In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or it went for eight Sul|lings or Plough-Lands, but in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour it was rated in <HI>Dom&s;day</HI> Book at &s;even Sullings, becau&s;e one Plough-Land was laid into his Demea&s;n. The Church dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> was anciently famous by a tra|ditional relation, (which I am not much moved with, for it wants the &s;tamp of venera|ble Authority) which did affirm, that the Block on which St. <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;ts Head was cut off, was brought into <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, and kept in this Church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place of &s;ecular Intere&s;t which doth occurre, is <HI>Pett,</HI> the Evidences of this place now in the hands of Sir <HI>Robert Honywood</HI> do mention the <HI>Petts</HI> to be in Ages of a very high A&s;&s;ent, that is, about the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, Proprietaries of it but publick Records reach no farther than <HI>Newcourt</HI> Lord of the Mannor of <HI>Newcourt</HI> not far di&s;tant; <HI>Jeffrey de Newcourt</HI> Son of <HI>Walter de Newcourt</HI> paid re&s;pective Aid in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third for his Lands at <HI>New|court</HI> and <HI>Pett.</HI> After the <HI>Newcourts</HI> were gone out, the <HI>Hatches</HI> were by Purcha&s;e

<P><HI>Stilley</HI> is another little Mannor lying within <HI>Charing,</HI> and was anciently enwrapt in the Revenue of <HI>Frene, John de Frene</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, is mentioned in <HI>Te&s;ta de Nevill,</HI> a Book collected in the twentieth year of that Prince, to have paid Aid at the Marriage of the Kings Sider, for Lands which he po&s;&s;e&s;t at <HI>Charing;</HI> after in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, there is a recital in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> of Sir <HI>Thomas de Brockhull</HI> Son of Sir <HI>William de Brockhull,</HI> who paid an Auxiliary &s;upply at the making of the Black Prince Knight for his Lands which he held at <HI>Saltwood, Calehill, Charing,</HI> and other places in this County; but after this the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was not long re&s;ident in this Family, for <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> this mans &s;econd Son, to whom the&s;e Mannors of <HI>Stilley</HI> and <HI>Newland</HI> were a&s;&s;igned for livelyhood, about the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, tran&s;mitted them by Sale to <HI>John Darell</HI> E&s;quire, Son of Sir <HI>William Darell,</HI> who was extracted out of the right ancient and Knightly Family of the <HI>Darells</HI> of <HI>Se&s;ay;</HI> from whom Sir <HI>John Darell</HI> of <HI>Calehill,</HI> and Lord of this Mannor of <HI>Stilley,</HI> is originally and lineally i&s;&s;ued out.</P>
<P><HI>Wickins</HI> is another Mannor circum&s;cribed within the Limits of this Pari&s;h, it was originally the Patrimony of <HI>Brent,</HI> a Family well endowed in this Track, and cer|tainly was as ancient a Seat of this Family as any which lay involved in their Re|venue, for <HI>John Brent</HI> Son of <HI>Robert de Brent</HI> of <HI>Charing</HI> paid re&s;pective Aid for Lands which he held here in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>William Brent</HI> who was Son of <HI>Hugh Brent</HI> of <HI>Charing,</HI> made his Will the twenty &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and di&s;po&s;ed of this place to his Son <HI>Hugh Brent;</HI> and this <HI>Hugh</HI> had I&s;&s;ue <HI>William Brent,</HI> who compo&s;ed his Te&s;tament in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh; and this <HI>William</HI> was great Grandfather to <HI>Thomas Brent,</HI> in whom the Male Line determined, &s;o that <HI>Margaret</HI> his Si&s;ter became his Sole Heir, who by matching with <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Newland</HI> is another eminent Mannor in <HI>Charing,</HI> which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family &s;o &s;tyled: Sir <HI>John de Newland</HI> lived here in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and &s;ealed with an <HI>E&s;collop</HI> upon a <HI>Cheveron</HI> for his Coat, which is yet vi&s;ible in ancient Regi&s;ters, and other venerable Monuments of Antiquity; but before the latrer end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was extingui&s;hed at this place, and then it became parcel of the noble Family of <HI>Brockhull</HI> of <HI>Cale-Hill,</HI> and continued folded up in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion untill the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away by Deed from <HI>Henry Brockhull</HI> to <HI>John Darrell</HI> E&s;quire, from whom it is by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Devolution now tran&s;ported to his Succe&s;&s;or Sir <HI>John Darrell</HI> of <HI>Cale-Hill</HI> Knight.</P>
<P><HI>Ever&s;ley</HI> next courts us to a Remembrance, it lies partly in <HI>Charing,</HI> and partly in <HI>Stacefield,</HI> and though now ob&s;cure, yet in elder times was made eminent by being one of the Man&s;ions of <HI>Brian de Ever&s;ley,</HI> a Man very eminent in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third and <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and is mentioned in the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> to have been a Benefactor to that Covent; but his Piety could not &s;ecure the Title to his Po&s;terity, for about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find it planted in the Po&s;|fe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Peiferer,</HI> by the Heir General of which Family called <HI>Julian,</HI> it came to be the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Thomas St. Leger,</HI> and he died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and bequeathed it to <HI>Mary</HI> his Daughter and Coheir, e&s;pou&s;ed to <HI>Henry Aucher,</HI> from whom it was wafted down by de&s;cendant Right to his Succe&s;&s;or Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher,</HI> who about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> alienated it to

<P><HI>Broughton</HI> is a Mannor which is likewi&s;e circum&s;cribed within the Limits of <HI>Charing,</HI> and had Owners likewi&s;e of that Sirname. <HI>Adam de Broughton</HI> and &s;ome|times written <HI>Brocton,</HI> flouri&s;hed here about the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and his De&s;cendants enjoyed the Proprietie of it untill the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and then it was alienated to <HI>Paun&s;her&s;t, Thomas Paun&s;her&s;t</HI> made his Will in the year of our Lord 1472, and gave it to <HI>Thomas Paun&s;her&s;t</HI> his Son, and he made his Will in the year 1503, and di&s;po&s;ed of it to his Daughter <HI>Joan Paun&s;her&s;t,</HI> and in Defailance of her I&s;&s;ue, to his Kin&s;man <HI>Thomas Paine;</HI> She decea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue, and &s;o the Remainder devolved to be the Inheritance of <HI>Paine,</HI> in which Name it remained untill times of our remembrance, and then it was alienated to the Father of the in|&s;tant Proprietary, <HI>Withick.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Clavertie</HI> is the la&s;t place in this Pari&s;h, which may exact our mention: it did belong before the Suppre&s;&s;ion to the Knights Ho&s;pitallers, and was one of tho&s;e places, in this Track, which was a Commaundry to the more general Seminary of this Order planted at <HI>Edwell.</HI> Upon the Di&s;&s;olution of this Order, here in <HI>England,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who condemned their Di&s;order and Luxury, only to improve his own, like the <HI>Lapwing,</HI> who cries mo&s;t when &s;he is farthe&s;t off from her Ne&s;t, this was added to the Demea&s;ne of the Crown: and King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth granted it to <HI>Peter Heyman</HI> E&s;quire, who was one of the Gentlemen off his Bedchamber, and great Grandfather to Sir <HI>Henry Hamon</HI> Baronet, who was the late Proprietarie of this Mannor of <HI>Claverty,</HI> a per&s;on to whom if I &s;hould not affirm my &s;elf &s;ignally and extraordinarily engaged, I de&s;erved to be repre&s;ented to Po&s;terity under the darke&s;t Complexion of Ingratitude.</P>

After this Family was gon out, the <HI>Gays</HI> a Family of no mean Account in this Track, were incorporated into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, de&s;cen|ded originally out of <HI>France,</HI> where there is a Family which even at this Day is known by the Name of <HI>Le-gay,</HI> and is planted in <HI>Normandy,</HI> from whence tho&s;e of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Gerne&s;ey</HI> are extracted, a Branch of which is tran&s;planted into <HI>South-Hampton,</HI> and there for ought I know flouri&s;hes at pre&s;ent. And to ju&s;tifie the Truth of this their Extraction, in the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Horton</HI>-Priory, there is mention of one <HI>John le Gay</HI> who was a Benefactor to their Hou&s;e, and though they are called at this day, only, without the Addition, <HI>Gay;</HI> yet this hath happened by Di&s;u&s;e and Intermi&s;&s;ion, by not adding it in their Cu&s;tomary writing and af|fixing it to their Name. But to proceed: <HI>Evington Court</HI> though it was not ori|ginally erected by this Family, yet certainly it was much inforced by Supple|ment, and additionall Building; for diver&s;e places of the Hou&s;e are in Relation to the Name, adorned with No&s;e-Gays. In Conclu&s;ion, after it had owned many of this Name of no vulgar Ranck for its Proprietaries, it was, about the begin|ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, by <HI>Chri&s;topher Gay,</HI> alienated to <HI>John Honywood</HI> E&s;quire, of the elde&s;t Family of the <HI>Honywoods;</HI> from whom in a direct Line, <HI>Edward Honywood</HI> E&s;quire, Son and Heir of Sir <HI>John Honywood,</HI> lately decea&s;ed, is extracted, and is now inve&s;ted in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place.</P>

<P>But to return into that Track, from whence this Digre&s;&s;ion hath made me wander; after it remained Cloi&s;tered up in the Revenue of the Church, for diver&s;e Ages, untill the Title was by the Generall Di&s;&s;olution di&s;lodged, and in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was by Royall Conce&s;&s;ion from that Prince, inve&s;ted in Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Serjeant at Law, and a Man under an eminent Character in tho&s;e Times; from whom, about the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, it pa&s;&s;ed a|way by Sale to <HI>Linch,</HI> a Family of good Antiquity in <HI>Kent,</HI> from whom the <HI>Linches</HI> of <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI> are primitively de&s;cended, and have been for &s;ome De&s;cents &s;eated at <HI>Linch Knock,</HI> a Ca&s;tle in that Province.

<P><HI>Bedenwell</HI> in this Pari&s;h had formerly the Repute of a Mannor, when it was the Inheri|tance of a Family called <HI>Boreford</HI> or more vulgarly <HI>Burford: Ro&s;e de Burford</HI> held it at her Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

And afterwards I find <HI>James de Burford</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Bedenwell</HI> in <HI>Erith,</HI> in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After this Family was expired, which was before the end of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, it came to be the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Draper,</HI> de&s;cended from an ancient Family of that Name in the County of <HI>Notingham,</HI> who concluded in a Female Heir. For <HI>William Killom</HI> matched with the &s;ole Daughter of <HI>John Draper,</HI> by whom he obtained <HI>Bedenwell;</HI> but with this Provi&s;o that he &s;hould change his Name to <HI>Draper,</HI> which hath been ever &s;ince both by <HI>Draper</HI> of <HI>Crayford,</HI> and <HI>Draper</HI> of <HI>Hering-Hill</HI> in <HI>Erith</HI> punctually performed.

<P><HI>Hering-Hill</HI> is a place not to be forgotten, having been in elder Times the Re&s;idence of a Family called <HI>Abell.</HI> The fir&s;t whom I find repre&s;ented to us, under a Cha|racter of e&s;timate, was Sir <HI>John Abell,</HI> who was in the Li&s;t of the Kenti&s;h Knights, which were A&s;&s;i&s;tant to King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, at his Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scot|land; John Abell</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or was a Judge (as is manife&s;t by the patent Rolls, of the <HI>Tower</HI>) in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and it is very probable, that it was either this <HI>John Abell</HI> or his Father, that obtained a Charter of Free-warren to the Mannor of <HI>Catford</HI> in <HI>Lew&s;ham</HI> (which was after &s;old to <HI>William de Monta|cute</HI>) in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t. In the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth: I find, by the Regi&s;ters of the Crown Office, one <HI>Edward Abell</HI> to have been in Commi&s;&s;ion for the Peace, and he lyes enter'd in <HI>Erith</HI> Church, not in the Coemitery or Church-yard: though I confe&s;&s;e, upon a large &s;quare Plate of Wood, there is a Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e accurately enrolled, who were Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of <HI>Hering-Hill,</HI> from <HI>John Abell</HI> the Judge, down to another <HI>John Abell</HI> who dyed po&s;&s;e&s;t of it about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> but the date is &s;o violated by Time and the Impre&s;&s;ion of the injurious Elements, that it is hardly vi&s;ible, much le&s;&s;e intelligible; the la&s;t of this Family at this place, was <HI>John Abell,</HI> who about the year 1611, joyning with his Father <HI>Samuell Abell,</HI> alienated his Concernment here to Mr. <HI>William Draper,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or Mr..... <HI>Draper,</HI> now of the County of <HI>Oxford,</HI> is the in&s;tant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Le&s;nes Abby</HI> was founded by <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England</HI> un|der <HI>H.</HI> the &s;econd, in the year 1179 and dedicated to St. <HI>Thomas</HI> the Martyr, the Saint of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who as he had been above the Kings Will on earth, was now above his Faith in Heaven, being after his, but early Canonization, grown into &s;uch Ve|neration and E&s;timate, that Ori&s;ons and Prayers, Shrines, and Altars, Abbyes and Tem|ples, were offered up to his Name, of which this was none of the lea&s;t, being a Hou&s;e of black Canons, or Canons of St. <HI>Augu&s;tins.</HI> This <HI>Richard de Lucy</HI> the Founder, was Son of <HI>Richard,</HI> who was Son of <HI>Roger de Chilham,</HI> and he was Son of <HI>Fulbert de Dover,</HI> who entred into <HI>England</HI> with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, and changed his Name of <HI>Lucy</HI> to <HI>Dover,</HI> (of which, fir&s;t, there is not only a Signiory or Lord&s;hip, but likewi&s;e a Family at this in&s;tant remaining in <HI>France</HI>) becau&s;e he was one of tho&s;e eight, to whom certain Knights-Fees were a&s;&s;igned by <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, to be A&s;&s;i&s;tant to <HI>John de Fiennes,</HI> in the Guard of <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle; thus much for his Extraction.

Yet notwith&s;tanding he de|ve&s;ted him&s;elf of that Pomp and Pageantry, the&s;e great Offices had made him glitter with (which Conque&s;t, that he made upon him&s;elf within, was of more Importance, then any he could have atchieved without) and clouded him&s;elf in a Monks Cowle, and became the Prior to that Covent, he him&s;elf had erected, and there likewi&s;e found his place of Sepulture: And it is probable, that tho&s;e Coffins, with Pourtraictures in&s;culped, which were di&s;covered in a Grotto or Vault, upon the breaking down the Foundation of this Hou&s;e, in the Government of King <HI>James,</HI> were the Exchequers which trea&s;ured up, not only the Reliques of this Sir <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> but likewi&s;e the remains of others of the &s;ame Family: But to proceed, the Prior of this place was in that Repute, that it was cu&s;tomary for him (as the Records of the Church of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> tell us) to have his Indu|ction into this place, either by the Bi&s;hop immediately, or el&s;e by &s;ome Proxie, who repre&s;ented the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>'s Per&s;on. And in this State it continued, untill Cardinall <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI> laid the Foundation of his eminent Colledge of <HI>Chri&s;tchurch</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and thenwith the con&s;ent of the pre&s;ent Abbot, in the year 1525, it was &s;uppre&s;t, and the Revenue of this Cloi&s;ter, being found in the Hands of the above&s;aid Cardinal at his Death, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, united to the Income of the Crown, where it dwelt, untill it was gran|ted to <HI>William Brereton</HI> E&s;quire, who being engaged in the fatall Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ka|tharine Howard,</HI> was attainted, and executed, upon who&s;e Tragedy, it returned to the Crown; and was in the thirty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to Sir <HI>Ralph Sadler;</HI> and he not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to Mr. <HI>Henry Cook;</HI> in who&s;e Suc|ce&s;&s;ors, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was re&s;ident, untill almo&s;t our Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to Sir <HI>Thomas Gainsford</HI> of <HI>Crowher&s;t</HI> in <HI>Surrey;</HI> who not many years &s;ince, demi&s;ed his Right in it to Mr. <HI>Haws</HI> of <HI>London;</HI> who dying lately with|out I&s;&s;ue, hath &s;etled it for ever, on the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Bartholomews</HI> in <HI>Smithfield.</HI></P>
<P>In the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badele&s;mer,</HI> obtained the Grant of a Market to <HI>Erith,</HI> on the Thur&s;day, and a three Days Fair at St. <HI>Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> and another three Days Fair, the Monday, Tue&s;day, and Wedne&s;day in Whit&s;on Week.</P>

Which his Holyne&s;s de&s;crying, wrapt them up in tho&s;e pre|tended Crimes, as the Roman Per&s;ecutors did the ancient Chri&s;tians, in the skins of Bea&s;ts, that they might more ea&s;ily be devoured.

This Mans Son and Heir was <HI>John Fremingham,</HI> who was one of the Con&s;ervators of the Peace of this County, in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the &s;econd year of that Prince, and afterwards had the Cu&s;tody of this County again, in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, but dyed without I&s;&s;ue; &s;o that <HI>Ann</HI> his Si&s;ter, matched to <HI>Roger I&s;ley,</HI> of <HI>Sundrich,</HI> became his Heir: and &s;o <HI>Farningham,</HI> was with her, brought to acknowledge the Intere&s;t of this Family, from whom it devol|ved to <HI>John I&s;ley,</HI> who&s;e Widow <HI>Alice I&s;ley,</HI> dyed po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>Farningham,</HI> in Right of Jointure, in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and from her it devolved to her Son <HI>Thomas I&s;ley,</HI> and he dyed &s;ei&s;ed of it in the eleventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and it was found at his Decea&s;e, that it was held in Knights Service of <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle, by the payment of a Rent-&s;ervice, of twenty one Shillings <HI>per An.</HI> and had the E&s;timate of a whole Knights Fee. After him his Son Sir <HI>Henry I&s;ley,</HI> &s;ucceeded in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, and being infortunately convicted of high Trea&s;on in the &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Mary, Farningham</HI> and <HI>Chartons</HI> e&s;chea|ted to the Crown: and that Prince&s;&s;e, in the &s;ame year, granted it back to his Son <HI>William I&s;ley</HI> E&s;quire, and he in the third and fourth of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> by a Deed enroll'd in Chancery, pa&s;&s;es away <HI>Farningham</HI> and the Moiety of <HI>Chartons,</HI> to <HI>William Roper</HI> E&s;quire, Grandfather to Sir <HI>Anthony Roper,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry Roper,</HI> from whom upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2+ words"> a Will made by his Brother Sir <HI>Anthony Roper,</HI> wherein he demi&s;es the Fee-&s;imple to Sir <HI>John Cotton</HI> of <HI>Cambridge-Shire,</HI> it is by Verdict taken away, and en&s;tated on the above mentioned Per&s;on.</P>
<P>The other Moiety of <HI>Chartons,</HI> gave Sirname to a Family, who held it as appears by <HI>Te&s;ta de Nevill,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. In Times of a lower De&s;cent, it was the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a good old Family, called <HI>Grove|her&s;t. William de Groveher&s;t</HI> paid re&s;pective Aid for it, at making the Black Prince Knight; and from him it devolved to his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Richard Groveher&s;t,</HI> who in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, determined in three Daughters and Coheirs, e&s;|pou&s;ed to <HI>Richard Tickhill, Richard Hextall,</HI> and <HI>John Petit,</HI> who about the Begin|ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, pa&s;&s;ed one Moiety of it to <HI>John Martin,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or and De&s;cendant <HI>Edward Martin</HI> above-mentioned, pa&s;&s;ed it away with <HI>Franks,</HI> men|tioned in <HI>Horton, Kirkby,</HI> in who&s;e Revenue it lyes now couched, about the be|ginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to Alderman <HI>Bathur&s;t,</HI> from whom, with <HI>Franks,</HI> it is now de|volved by De&s;cent, to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Edward Bathur&s;t,.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ralph de Fremingham,</HI> obtained a Weekly Market to his Mannor of <HI>Farningham,</HI> on the Tuesday, and a Fair yearly to continue for four Days, the Vigil, the day of St. <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and two days after, by Grant from <HI>Henry</HI> the third in the fifty fifth year of his Reign, <HI>Pat. An.</HI> 55. <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. <HI>Memb.</HI> 12. Which Grant was renewed and confirmed to <HI>John de Fremingham,</HI> in the &s;eventh and eighth years of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd.</P>
<P><HI>Chimbham</HI> is another Mannor in this Pari&s;h, which did give Name to a Family of
<PB N="152" REF="84">that Appellation, for I find in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> that when <HI>John de Fremingham,</HI> pays Aid for his Mannors of <HI>Farningham</HI> and <HI>Chimbham,</HI> there is a Recitall of <HI>Lawrence de Chimbham,</HI> which formerly held it in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. But it is evident both by that Record, and by the Inqui&s;ition taken after his Death which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: that <HI>John de Freming|ham</HI> held it, and tran&s;mitted it to his Son <HI>Ralph de Fremingham,</HI> who&s;e Son and Heir <HI>John Fremingham,</HI> dying without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Ann</HI> his Si&s;ter entred upon the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this, as his next Heir, and brought it with her to her Husband <HI>Roger I&s;ley</HI> of <HI>Sundridge.</HI> And &s;o this Family became concerned in it, and kept their Intere&s;t here until the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Sibill</HI> of <HI>Littlemoat</HI> in <HI>Ainsford:</HI> in which Name the Propriety had not been long wrapt up, when this Family, found its Sepulcher in a Female Heir. For <HI>Ed. Sibell,</HI> the la&s;t of this Name, re&s;olved into a Daughter and Heir, matched to <HI>Hide:</HI> and he not many years &s;ince, conveyed it by Sale, to Alderman <HI>Bunce</HI> of <HI>Lon|don.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fairfield</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Langport,</HI> was given to the Church of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> by St. <HI>Edm.</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and Chancellor of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> about the year 1238, and more to fortifie the Donation, affixed his Seal, (<HI>Sigillo &s;uo confirmavit,</HI> &s;ay the Records of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI>) to the originall Grant. This upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion, was upon the In&s;titution of the Dean and Chapter of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, confirmed by Grant to them.</P>
<P><HI>Faukham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Ac&s;tane,</HI> was the Seat, and gave the Sirname to an ancient Family called <HI>Faukham.</HI> The fir&s;t whom I find upon Record is <HI>Walle|ran de Faukham,</HI> who flouri&s;hed here in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, as appears by the Book called <HI>Nova Feoffamenta,</HI> taken in that Princes Reign, and kept in the Exchequer. Afterwards in Times of a more modern date it acknowledged the Signory of the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on,</HI> Baron of <HI>Ferneborough,</HI> and <HI>Otho de Grandi&s;on,</HI> is &s;aid, in the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> with <HI>Gilbert de Kirkbie,</HI> to have held one Knights Fee in <HI>Faukham</HI> of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> which <HI>Ro&s;e de Faukham</HI> and <HI>William de St. Clere</HI> of <HI>Ford</HI> in <HI>Wrotham</HI> formerly held, and this <HI>Otho</HI> Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the thirty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

So that his E&s;tate here and in other places, was divided between his Si&s;ters and Coheirs; whereof this, came to be po&s;&s;e&s;t by Sir <HI>John Northwood,</HI> in Right of <HI>Agnes</HI> one of his Si&s;ters, from whom by a con&s;tant Line of Succe&s;&s;ion, it was guided down to his Son Sir <HI>Roger Northwood,</HI> who was extingui&s;hed in a Female Heir called <HI>Albina Northwood,</HI> matched to <HI>John Diggs</HI> of <HI>Diggs Court</HI> in <HI>Berham</HI> E&s;quire: who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and &s;o in her Right, this Mannor devolved to this Family, and lay couched in their E&s;tate until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Barham</HI> of <HI>Ber|ham-Court</HI> in <HI>Te&s;ton.</HI> In which Name the Propriety had not been long re&s;ident, when <HI>Thomas Barham</HI> E&s;quire, concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Ann,</HI> who was e&s;pou&s;ed to Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler,</HI> who ca&s;t this into his Revenue, from whom it is now come down to Sir <HI>Oliver Boteler</HI> Baronet, only Son of Sir <HI>William Boteler,</HI> &s;lain at <HI>Cropready</HI> Bridge, in a&s;&s;erting the Royall Quarrell.</P>
<P><HI>Frendsbury</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> hath &s;everall places in it worthy of our Cogni&s;ance. The fir&s;t is <HI>E&s;lingham,</HI> which was given to the Church of St. <HI>An|drews</HI> in <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> by <HI>Kenulfus</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> as the Book called <HI>Textus Roffen|&s;is</HI> informs me: But by the Regi&s;ters of that Church, I find that <HI>John de St. Clere,</HI> held it in Lea&s;e of the Covent, about the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and after him a Family called <HI>Neal,</HI> who had large Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions about <HI>Higham,</HI> were Le&s;&s;ees to the Cloi&s;ter. In the &s;ixth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, I find <HI>John Rykeld</HI> held it, and kept his Shrievalty at this place: after him a Family called <HI>Frogenhall,</HI> was by Right of Lea&s;e in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, po&s;&s;e&s;t of
<PB N="153" REF="84">it, but upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion of this Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this Mannor was found to be Lea&s;e to <HI>Audley</HI> and <HI>Fi&s;her;</HI> and then the Fee-&s;imple in Rever&s;ion was granted to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Crom|well</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex:</HI> who, being by the Malice of his Enemies, who had rai&s;ed all their Black Engines of Mi&s;chief upon him, a&s;per&s;ed with the Calumnious Re|proach of high Trea&s;on, was attainted in the thirty &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and made a Peace-offering to the Fury of his irreconcileable Adver&s;a|ries; then this, by E&s;cheat, returns back to the Crown; after which that Prince, by his Royall Conce&s;&s;ion, makes it the Inheritance, of Sir <HI>Will. Drury</HI> of <HI>Nor|folke,</HI> in which Family it remained, untill Times of our Knowledge and Remem|brance, and then the Intere&s;t was by Sale, tran&s;lated into <HI>Henry Clerk</HI> E&s;quire, Serjeant at Law, and late Recorder of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> from whom it is now come down to his Son and Heir <HI>Francis Clerk</HI> E&s;quire, collaterally de&s;cended from that eminent Souldier Sir <HI>John Clerk</HI> of <HI>Willoughby</HI> in <HI>Warwick-&s;hire,</HI> who took <HI>Lewis de Orleans</HI> Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> Pri&s;oner, in that memorable Encounter commenced between <HI>Bomy</HI> and <HI>Spours,</HI> Villages not far di&s;tant from <HI>Terowan</HI> or <HI>Terwin,</HI> in the fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which was Signally te&s;tified by that Prince, when by his Favour and Command, there was annexed this Augmentation to his pater|nall Coat <HI>viz,</HI> upon a <HI>Canton Azure</HI> a <HI>Demy Ram</HI> Saliant Argent, armed <HI>Or,</HI> between two <HI>Flower de Lis</HI> of the la&s;t, over all a <HI>Batton</HI> or <HI>Truncheon</HI> (which intimates to us, that that Captive-Duke, was one of the Mar&s;halls of <HI>France</HI>) <HI>Dexterways</HI> in <HI>Bend,</HI> of the Second.</P>
<P><HI>Chaddington</HI> is a &s;econd place of Account, and repre&s;ents to our Remembrance, the Lords <HI>Cobham,</HI> who were in elder Times, Lords of the Fee. <HI>John de Cobham</HI> dyed &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Goddington</HI> is a third place, which calls for our Con&s;ideration: It was parcel of the Patrimony of the ancient Family of <HI>Charles. Robert Charles,</HI> who was po&s;&s;e&s;t of Land about <HI>Hilden</HI> in <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> and was Bailiff of the Forre&s;t or Cha&s;e there to <HI>Robert de Clare</HI> Earl of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> was &s;ei&s;ed of it at his Death, which was in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot.

From whom it devolved to <HI>Nicholas Charles,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue in the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Alice</HI> one of his Si&s;ters and Coheirs brought this to be the Inheritance of <HI>William Snaith,</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the ninth year of K. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, de&s;cended from <HI>William de Snaith,</HI> who was made Chancellor of the Kings Exchequer, during Plea&s;ure, in the fifty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but this Family likewi&s;e going out in a Daughter and Heir, &s;he by matching with <HI>Watton,</HI> who&s;e Ance&s;tor held Lands at <HI>Rydley</HI> nere <HI>A&s;h,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, annexed it to the Incom of that Family, in which Name the Title hath ever &s;ince, by an even and permanent Succe&s;&s;ion re&s;ided.</P>
<P><HI>Wain&s;cot</HI> is the la&s;t place of any Eminence. It was a Branch which was en|grafted upon that Demea&s;ne which fell under the Signiory of the <HI>Colepepers</HI> of <HI>Alresford. Walter Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Pre&s;ton</HI> in that Pari&s;h, held it at his Death, which was in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 80. And into the Patrimony of this Family did the Right of it, by a Succe&s;&s;ion of many De&s;cents, even &s;eem to have bin riveted, having continued con&s;tant to this Name, from the a|bove mentioned <HI>Walter Colepeper,</HI> untill the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Randolph,,</HI> from which Family in Times which were within the Circle of our Fathers Remembrance it pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale to <HI>Somers,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>William Somer,</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth who held much Land in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> who&s;e Son not many years &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed it away, to Mr. <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Fren&s;ted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was honored anciently, by being parcel of the Pa|trimony of the noble Family of <HI>Crombwell,</HI> written &s;o in elder Times, though &s;ince a &s;of|ter pronunciation hath been quilted into the Name, &s;o that in Times of a more mo|dern A&s;pect, it hath been written <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who had here a Seat called now <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> but in elder Orthography written <HI>Mereham</HI> Court. The fir&s;t of this Family whom I find po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, was <HI>John de Crombwell,</HI> who in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, as Sir <HI>Henry Spelman,</HI> in his Glo&s;&s;ary, in the Word <HI>Ban|neretus,</HI> cites the Record out of the Office of the <HI>Pell,</HI> was written <HI>Banneret.</HI> Now what the&s;e <HI>Bannerets</HI> were, I &s;hall briefly unfold: they were formerly called <HI>Vex|illiferi,</HI> becau&s;e their Inve&s;titure anciently, was, by delivering to them a <HI>Guidon,</HI> which was nothing but a <HI>Pennon</HI> cut off at the end, which before flowed out into an acute Angle, and now was fa&s;hioned and compo&s;ed into a Square. And as an|ciently, thirteen Knights Fees, did in the vulgar E&s;timate, make up a Tenure <HI>per Baroniam;</HI> &s;o did ten Knights Fees compo&s;e a <HI>Banneret,</HI> out of which he was (when&s;oever the Affairs of the Prince did require) to bring into the Field twelve or &s;ixteen Chevaliers or Hor&s;emen, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons of no cheap or incon&s;idera|ble Account, but &s;uch as could (as Sir <HI>Henry Spelman</HI> notes, <HI>ex Praediis &amp; Peculio proprio</HI>) out of their own Patrimony, Equipp, Hor&s;e and furniture of Armes, pro|portionate to the Service they were to be embarked in.</P>
<P>But to proceed: <HI>Ralph de Crombwell,</HI> Son of the above&s;aid <HI>John,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, obtained a Charter of Free-warren, to his Lands here at <HI>Fren&s;ted</HI> and <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> but his Family, after the Grant of this Franchi&s;e, did not long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their Inheritance here; for <HI>Richard de Crombwell,</HI> this mans Son, about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Hugh Girund,</HI> in whom the Title was as &s;ickle and volatile: for he determining in <HI>Mawd</HI> his Sole Daugh|ter and Heir, &s;he by matching with <HI>Henry de Chalfhunt,</HI> made it his Patrimony, and he in his Wifes Right, was &s;ei&s;ed of it at his Death, which was in the forty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 14. And in this Family, did the Propriety of <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> and other Lands at <HI>Fren&s;ted,</HI> continue inve&s;ted untill the Entrance of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth; and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Hadde,</HI> now called <HI>Hadds,</HI> and <HI>William Hadde</HI> held <HI>Meriam Court,</HI> and the Land annexed to it here at <HI>Fren&s;ted</HI> at his Decea&s;e, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and in this Family was the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion con&s;tantly re&s;ident, untill that Age which fell within the Circle of our Grandfathers Knowledge; and then it was conveyed to <HI>Archer,</HI> from which Family &s;ome few years &s;ince, it went off by Sale to <HI>Thatcher.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Yokes Court</HI> is another ancient Seat in <HI>Fren&s;ted,</HI> which, as high as any Beam, either of Publick Record, or private Muniments, can conduct me to a Di&s;cove|ry; I find, acknowledged the noble Family of <HI>Northwood,</HI> and owned the In|tere&s;t of that Family, untill the thirty fifth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and then <HI>Roger de Northwood</HI> dying without I&s;&s;ue-male, bequeathed it to his only Daughter and Heir, <HI>Albina Northwood;</HI> who by matching with <HI>John Digge</HI> of <HI>Diggs Court</HI> in <HI>Berham,</HI> united this Seat to the Intere&s;t of that Name and Family, and they to keep Life in her Memory, (a &s;mall Preferment beyond the Fate of humane Frailty,) that had improved their Paternal Inheritance with &s;o great a Supplement of Ad|ditional E&s;tate, erected a fair Monument over her A&s;hes in <HI>Berham</HI> Church, and adorned it with a French Epitaph, which in&s;tructs the Reader, who&s;e Du&s;t &s;leeps beneath the Marble Repo&s;itory. Indeed in this Act, this Family &s;eemed to be Corrivalls with the Egyptians, who expended more upon the Structure of their Tombs then Hou&s;es, becau&s;e they knew they were to dwell longer in them. But I have digre&s;&s;ed. I now proceed: Thus have you &s;een how this Seat fell under Signiory of <HI>Diggs,</HI> and the &s;ucceeding Records of this Family will inform you, that the Title made its aboad in this Name, untill allmo&s;t that Age we call our Fathers; and then it was tran&s;mitted by Sale to <HI>Archer,</HI> from whom not many years &s;ince, a Fatality like the former, hath now brought it to bee the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Thatcher.</HI></P>
<PB N="155" REF="85">
<P><HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> affords a Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed. In the year 812, in the Charter of <HI>Kenulf</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> it is called the Kings little Town. It &s;eems it was of no bigg Dimen&s;ion then, though it be multiplyed and &s;wolne into a greater Bulk &s;ince; yet, as &s;mall as it was, <HI>Athel&s;tan</HI> in the year 903, held a publick Moot or great Coun&s;ell here, (which A&s;&s;emblies &s;ince the Normans entring here were termed Parliaments) and enacted &s;everall Laws, in this Convention. Probably enough, it belonged to the Crown in elder Times, and was a Mannor-hou&s;e of the Kings: for <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour (as the Records of St. <HI>Au&s;tins</HI> te&s;tifie) gave the Advow&s;on of the Church, to that Abby, in the year 1072, and the Mannor it &s;elf to a Norman, in Recompence of &s;ome &s;ignal Ser|vice. But when King <HI>Stephen,</HI> re&s;olved to erect the Abby there, he compoun|ded with <HI>William de Ipre</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and gave him the Mannor of <HI>Lilly-Church</HI> in Exchange for it, and his Queen <HI>Matilda,</HI> rai&s;ed a &s;tately Mona&s;tery which &s;he &s;tored with Monks, of the Order of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> which were brought thither by <HI>Clarem|bald</HI> the fir&s;t Abbot, from the Abby of St. <HI>Marys</HI> at <HI>Bermond&s;ey</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and procured a Letter to be writ from <HI>Peter Abbot</HI> of that place, to ab&s;olve and re|lea&s;e them from all Obedience, to the Order of the <HI>Cluniac's.</HI> And here was K. <HI>Stephen, Matilda</HI> his Wife, and <HI>Eu&s;tace</HI> Earl of <HI>Boloign,</HI> his Son, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and Con&s;table of <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle &s;olemnly enter'd. Of which for|mer King it is ob&s;erved, that though his Reign were rough and tempe&s;tuous, by Rea&s;on of his perptuall Debates and Conte&s;ts, with <HI>Mawd</HI> the Empre&s;&s;e and her Son, concerning the Title; yet were there more Religious Convents erected in his Rule then either before or after; which made it appear though the Times were bad they were not impious. And certainly, from the uneven and imperfect Pro&s;pect, which tho&s;e Times folded up in the Flame and Smoak of Civil War, have afforded us of this Prince, and of his Sway of the Scepter, we may conclude that in all things, he was fit to be a King, but that he was one. <HI>Thorne</HI> the Chronicler relates two Conte&s;ts that happened between the Monks of St. <HI>Augu&s;tins</HI> and others: the fir&s;t was between them and King <HI>John</HI> animated by <HI>Hughbert</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> touching the Right of Patronage, of the Church of St. <HI>Mary Charity</HI> at <HI>Fever&s;ham.</HI> The K. apprehending the Advow&s;on of the Church, belonged to him, or at lea&s;t made to believe &s;o by the Archbi&s;hop, pre&s;ents a Clerk to the Church, and commands his Pre|&s;entment &s;hould be received, which they not only di&s;obeyed, but ejected the Clerk, and &s;ent diver&s;e of their Monks to maintain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Church by &s;trong Hand. Which the King under&s;tanding, commanded <HI>Reginald de Cornhill</HI> the Sheriff, to di&s;&s;ei&s;e them and re&s;tore his pre&s;ented Clerk, which he in Order to the Kings Injunction, not without a vigorous Re&s;i&s;tance by the Monks effected. Upon which, the Monks complain to <HI>Stephen</HI> the Popes Legat, who then was there journeying to <HI>Rome,</HI> and in his Way &s;ojourned at their Cloi&s;ter. And he com|pa&s;&s;ionating their Condition, advi&s;ed them to &s;end their Prior to <HI>Rome,</HI> lea&s;t the Power of the See Apo&s;tolick might, by this Affront and Inroad upon it, be tram|pled under Foot. Hereupon the Pope, upon Adverti&s;ement received, i&s;&s;ues out a Commi&s;&s;ion to under&s;tand the Matter in Debate: But the Monks upon a &s;erious Debate with them&s;elves, knowing the King's impetuous Temper, they found out a more compendious Method for an Accommodation, and pre&s;ented the King with two Hundred Marks in a Pur&s;e, and a meet Palfrey for his Saddle, by which Do|native they &s;o endeared the K. that they obtained Re&s;titution of their Right, and made him for the future, their gratious Patron.</P>
<P>Another Conflict fell out after this, between the Abbot, and Maior and Burgers of this Town, about &s;ome Intru&s;ions and encroachments made by the Town&s;men, as was pretended, upon the Franchi&s;es of the Church. You may be &s;ure <HI>Thorn</HI> who relates it, is warped with a partial Engagement to his own Fraternity, and with that Caution you may read him. Upon the Di&s;&s;olution made in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, this Mannor with all its Priviledges returned to the Crown, and lay incorporated with its Revenue untill the Reign of King <HI>Charles.</HI> And then it was granted to Sir <HI>Dudley Diggs</HI> of <HI>Chilham</HI> Ca&s;tle, who not long after &s;etled it on his &s;econd Son Mr. <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Fi&s;hbourne</HI> in this Pari&s;h, is an ancient Mannor, from whence a Family of that Sirname borrowed its Appellation. One <HI>John de Fi&s;t bourn</HI> was a Witne&s;&s;e to that Charter, by which a place called <HI>Me&s;&s;ewell</HI> was given to <HI>Fever&s;ham</HI> Abby, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd. Afterwards, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find the <HI>Dreylonds</HI> to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, but their ancient Seat, was at <HI>Cokesditch</HI> in this Pari&s;h. For in a Deed dated the twenty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Stephen Dreylond,</HI> whereby he demi&s;es &s;ome Land in a place called <HI>Crouchfield,</HI> to <HI>William Makenade,</HI> writes him&s;elf of <HI>Cokesditch;</HI> and in this Family did the Intere&s;t of <HI>Fi&s;hbourne</HI> continue, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth. And then it was alienated to <HI>Simons,</HI> to which Name the Title hath remained con&s;tantly allied to this Day. Nor was <HI>Cokesditch</HI> fixed in <HI>Dreylond</HI> by a Tenure more permanent, for <HI>katharine</HI> Sole Heir of Sir <HI>Richard Dreylond,</HI> was matched to <HI>Reginald Norton</HI> of <HI>Milton</HI> E&s;quire, and &s;o with her both the Name and Pro|priety of this place were entombed in this Family; and this <HI>Reginald</HI> upon his Decea&s;e, gave it to his &s;econd Son <HI>William Norton,</HI> and from him &s;ucce&s;&s;ively was it tran&s;mitted to others of that Line, untill tho&s;e Times which confined upon our Fathers Remembrance: And then it was alienated to <HI>Par&s;ons,</HI> who was not long &s;eated in his new Acqui&s;ts, but he conveys it away to <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> by who&s;e Daughter and Heir it is lately tran&s;planted into <HI>Buck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Frittenden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> re&s;olves it &s;elf into &s;everal places which call for our Notice. The fir&s;t is <HI>Comden.</HI> It was clap&s;ed up within the Revenue of the Priory of <HI>Leeds,</HI> untill the Storm or Hurricano rather, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, threw it into the Demea&s;n of the Crown. And then that Prince, in the thirty &s;econd year of his Reign, conveyed it by Grant to Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> and he in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, tran&s;mitted it by his Deed to Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or Sir <HI>John Baker,</HI> even in tho&s;e Times which entrenched on our Remembrance, pa&s;&s;ed it away to Mr....... <HI>Cleyton</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bewper</HI> is the &s;econd place of account in this Pari&s;h. It was in elder Times an Appendage or Fragment of that Demea&s;n, which did contribute to the Support of the Abby of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion of that Cloi&s;ter or Seminary, by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was in the thirty fifth year of that Princes Reign, gran|ted to Sir <HI>Thomas Moil,</HI> who not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Robert Prat.</HI> And his Son Ma&s;ter <HI>Franci. Prat, primo Elizabethae,</HI> by Fine conveyed it to Mr <HI>Edward Bathur&s;t,</HI> who not many years after, tran&s;planted his Intere&s;t here by Sale into Sir <HI>Richard Baker,</HI> Ance&s;tor to Sir <HI>Jo. Baker</HI> of <HI>Si&s;inghur&s;t</HI> Baronet, who now by pater|nal Succe&s;&s;ion, is entituled to the in&s;tant Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Wallinghur&s;t</HI> and <HI>Buckhur&s;t</HI> are two petty Mannors, which belonged to the Abby of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> but upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion of that Covent, they were pared off, and by Grant from <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his Reign, were en&s;tated upon <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> But long he was not endowed with them: for in the thirty &s;econd year of that Prince's Government, he was be&s;pattered and bla&s;ted with an Accu&s;ation of high Trea&s;on, which the Subtlety of his Adver&s;aries had woven &s;o clo&s;ely together that he was entangled in it; and being attainted, forfeited both his Life and E&s;tate to the Fury, I cannot &s;ay Ju&s;tice, of an incen&s;ed Prince: Among&s;t the Ruines of his Patrimony, the&s;e two places were comprehended, and upon his Shipwrack it returned to the Crown. And then King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by a new Grant in the &s;ame year they e&s;cheated, pa&s;&s;ed them away to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t</HI> in <HI>Cranebroke,</HI> from whom they are now come down to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, his Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><HI>Upper Pea&s;ridge</HI> was involved in that &s;patious Inheritance, which fell under the Dominion of the Lord <HI>Badele&s;mer,</HI> of whom I &s;hall &s;peak more at <HI>Leeds,</HI> and when he by his Di&s;loyalty had forfeited both Life and Fortune to the Crown, this was enwrapt in the E&s;cheat. But was re&s;tored in the &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badele&s;mer</HI> this Mans Son, and he in the twelfth year of that Prince, held it at his Death, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 44. But <HI>Giles</HI> his only Son dying without I&s;|&s;ue, his great E&s;tate was &s;plit into parcells, and this with &s;ome more of his Demea&s;ne
<PB N="157" REF="86">was allotted to <HI>Mawd</HI> his Si&s;ter and Coheir, who was matched to <HI>John Vere</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and he in her Right was po&s;&s;e&s;t of it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 84. And in this Family did it re&s;ide untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed a|way by Sale to <HI>St. Leger,</HI> to who&s;e Patrimony it remained annexed untill the Go|vernment of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary;</HI> and then an Alienation like the former, brought it over to <HI>Lone,</HI> de&s;cended from the <HI>Lones</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> where there is yet a Hou&s;e of the Name: and being thus fixt in this Family, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion continues &s;till united to it.</P>
<P><HI>Fordwich</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>We&s;t-Gate,</HI> was given to the Abbot and Monks of St. <HI>Au&s;tins</HI> (as the Annalls of that Convent te&s;tifie) by King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, and was given <HI>ad Ve&s;titum,</HI> for Reparation of their Apparell. And there is a Tra|dition, that <HI>Hemp-Hall</HI> which was an Appendage to this Mannor, did pay a quit-Rent in Hemp: but certainly it mu&s;t be then for the u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;ecular per&s;ons which related as Officers and Servants to this Cloi&s;ter; for the Monks them&s;elves being under the Rule of <HI>Bennet,</HI> harrowed their Skin with Shirts of Hair, and &s;lept <HI>ve&s;titi</HI> in their Apparell, the more to tame and controle the Mutinies and Di&s;|orders of the Fle&s;h. But to advance: After this Mannor (which the Piety of for|mer Ages had planted in the Revenue of the Church) had for a large Decur&s;ion of Time owned no other Proprietary; it was by the Di&s;&s;olution in the twenty ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, emptied into the Income of the Crown, where it lay, untill <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth in the &s;eventh year of his Reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> and he not long after alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>John John&s;on,</HI> from whom it came over by Purcha&s;e to <HI>Paramour,</HI> who pa&s;&s;ed it away to the Lady <HI>Elizabeth Finch,</HI> Widow of Sir <HI>Moile Finch,</HI> who&s;e Son <HI>Thomas Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ey,</HI> almo&s;t in our Memory pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>John Finch</HI> Baron of <HI>Ford|wich,</HI> late Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> in the year 1640, and in him does the in&s;tant Signory of it re&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Folkstone</HI> does contribute a Name to the Hundred in which it is &s;ituated. The Mannor it &s;elf with the Mannor of <HI>Walton,</HI> was given to the Nunnery by <HI>Eadbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> which it &s;eems was of that Repute in tho&s;e Times, that <HI>Ean&s;wide</HI> his Daughter was there vailed a Nun, under the Rule of St. <HI>Bennet;</HI> and <HI>Ermen|red</HI> and <HI>Ercombert</HI> his Sons, changed their hopes of a Crown, into tho&s;e of one more cele&s;tiall, and folded up all their Earthly Glories in a Mona&s;tick Cowle, which they a&s;&s;umed at this place, under the Di&s;cipline of St. <HI>Bennet.</HI> But this Cloi&s;ter was &s;ome Ages after, partly by the Fury of the <HI>Danes,</HI> and partly by the Impre&s;&s;ions of the Sea, reduced into a heap of Ruines: &s;o that in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour, <HI>William de Muneville</HI> laid the Foundations of a new Priory in another place of the Town; which was much augmented afterwards by <HI>William de Averenches,</HI> who had married his only Daughter. But it &s;eems upon the former Deva&s;tation of this religious Seminary, the Mannor had returned to the Crown: for in the year one thou&s;and thirty and eight, <HI>Canutus</HI> re&s;tored to <HI>Chri&s;t-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury</HI> (as the Records of that Covent do intimate) this Mannor of <HI>Folkston;</HI> which <HI>Athel&s;tan,</HI> Son of King <HI>Edward,</HI> in the year nine hun|dred twenty and eight, had formerly granted to them for the health of his Fa|thers Soul, and to the Honor of <HI>&V;lfhelme</HI> Arch-prie&s;t of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but with this Re&s;triction, he limits and bounds this his Conce&s;&s;ion, that this Mannor thus returned to the Church, &s;hould never be alienated by the Arch-bi&s;hop without the Con&s;ent of the King and the Covent of <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> who, it appears, joyned with <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour and the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and fa&s;tned it a|gain to this Priory, where it remained, untill it was torn away by the Suppre&s;&s;ion, in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and annexed to the Crown: Afterwards that Prince, in the thirtieth year of his Reign, tran&s;planted his Intere&s;t in it and <HI>Wal|ton,</HI> by Grant into <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> and he the &s;ame year pa&s;&s;ed them away to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who being attainted in the thirty &s;econd year of the above&s;aid Prince: the Propriety of <HI>Folkston</HI> and <HI>Walton,</HI> returned to
<PB N="158" REF="87">the Crown, and re&s;ided in the Royal Patrimony, untill the &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and then they were regranted to <HI>Edward</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> above&s;aid, who not long after conveyed them to Mr. <HI>Henry Herd&s;on,</HI> who&s;e Grandchild Mr. <HI>Francis Herd&s;on,</HI> alienated them to his Uncle Mr. <HI>John Herd&s;on,</HI> about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and he upon his Decea&s;e (without any lawfull I&s;&s;ue,) gave them to his Nephew, Sir <HI>Ba&s;ill Dixwell</HI> Knight and Baronet, de&s;cended from the ancient Family of <HI>Dixwell</HI> in the North-riding of <HI>York-&s;hire.</HI> Who likewi&s;e making his Ex|it without any lawful I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Mark Dixwell</HI> E&s;quire his Nephew became his Heir, and from him is the Propriety of both the&s;e places de&s;cended to his Son and Heir, <HI>Ba|&s;ill Dixwell</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P>The Nunnery of <HI>Folkston</HI> above&s;aid, being much defaced, was in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, reedified and ree&s;tabli&s;hed by <HI>John de Clinton,</HI> and <HI>John de Se|grave,</HI> and <HI>Julian</HI> his Wife; which was upon this &s;econd Erection &s;tored with Nuns, who were to live as formerly, under the Rule of St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Ean&s;with.</HI> But when it was found, in the &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, that it related by forrein Dependance to the Abby of <HI>Lolley</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> it was by that prudent and cautious Monarch Suppre&s;t.</P>
<P>There were five Churches anciently in <HI>Folkston,</HI> three of which were dedicated to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> St. <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Paul;</HI> all which and one more, who&s;e Name is not now obvious, were long &s;ince by the A&s;&s;aults of the Elements, and Deva&s;tations of men, utterly di&s;mantled: only that which was erected in the year 1095. by <HI>Nigellus de Muneville,</HI> and devoted to St. <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Ean&s;with,</HI> hath been too hard a Mor&s;el for the teeth of Time to con&s;ume.</P>
<P><HI>Folkston</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to be held here weekly on the Thur&s;day, by the Mediation of <HI>Geffrey Fitz-Peter,</HI> in the &s;ixth year of King <HI>John,</HI> which was confirmed to <HI>William de Averenches,</HI> in the &s;ixteenth year of the above|&s;aid Prince, and renewed to Sir <HI>John Segrave,</HI> in the twenty &s;econd year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third.</P>

<P><HI>Eabald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> about 1000 years &s;ince, built a Ca&s;tle at the South part of this Town of <HI>Folkston,</HI> which being &s;hrunk into Decay, <HI>William de Averenches</HI> erected a Fort in the year 1068, on the Foundation of the formerly demoli&s;hed Pile, who&s;e ruinous Shell or Skeleton is yet vi&s;ible,</P>
<P>I have &s;een a Leafe by &s;ome injurious Hand torn out from the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Folkston,</HI> which &s;ets forth the entertainment which the Family of <HI>Poynings</HI> were to have, when they came to hear Ma&s;&s;e at the Priory; a &s;ubtle Artifice u&s;ed by the Monks of that Age, to catch the Benevolence of the noble&s;t and mo&s;t opulent Families of the Nation, that certainly (had not the Statute of Mortmain, or Law of Amorti|zation made in the &s;eventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, re&s;trained and contracted the unlimited Bounty of the Laity to the&s;e religious Cloi&s;ters,) almo&s;t all the Land which was of &s;ecular Intere&s;t, had been ingulphed in the Revenue of the Church: &s;o that as one well ob&s;erves this over-active and operative Devotion, would have dedicated all to God, and have left Little or Nothing to have given to <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Terlingham</HI> and <HI>Ackhanger,</HI> were the Patrimony as high as the Reign of the Conquerour (as Doom&s;day in&s;tructs us) of <HI>William de Muneville,</HI> the Repairer and Re&s;torer, if not Founder and E&s;tabli&s;her of <HI>Folkston</HI> priory.

<P>You may find mention of <HI>Walkelme Magminot,</HI> in the Catalogue of the Lord Wardens. But the Daughter and Heir of this Line, was married to <HI>Say,</HI> from whom it came to be called <HI>Says-Court,</HI> which Name it &s;till retaineth: And was by rea&s;on of the Commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Meadows belonging to it, and Stalls there erected, made a place, in the Time of the late King, for feeding Sheep and Oxen, &s;erved by Compo&s;ition for the Kings Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>William</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> held the Mannor of <HI>We&s;t-Greenwich,</HI> and one Me&s;&s;uage in <HI>Deptford, Anno</HI> 29. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. by <HI>We&s;t-Greenwich,</HI> which was ment by that which we now call <HI>Deptford Strand:</HI> and by <HI>Deptford,</HI> is ment the upper Town, where a fair &s;trong Stone Bridge, lately erected, doth acknowledge the &s;ole Royal bounty of K. <HI>Charles,</HI> by this In&s;cription.</P>
<P>This Bridge was re-edified at the only charge of King <HI>Charles,</HI> in the fourth year of his Reign, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1628. In former Times it w as repaired at the Charge of the Contry adjacent. For I find by a Record in the <HI>Tower. E&s;c

<P>One thing more I have to mention: and that is <HI>Hacham,</HI> which was, in K. <HI>Hen.</HI> the &s;econds Time, the Seat of <HI>Hacham,</HI> lying upon the Confines of <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Kent-fields</HI> or <HI>Kent-lands,</HI> within this County; as <HI>Kent-Hatch</HI> in <HI>We&s;terham,</HI> is the very out-&s;ide of this Shire: As that place towards <HI>Surrey,</HI> called <HI>Kent-Hou&s;e,</HI> de&s;igns the Bounderies of this County, between <HI>Bekenham</HI> and <HI>Croydon.</HI> Divers Inqui|&s;itions, taken &s;ince that time, have found <HI>Hacham</HI> to be in <HI>Kent.</HI></P>

<P>In the forty third of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it appears, that the Mannor of <HI>Hache&s;ham,</HI> was granted to the Priore&s;&s;e of <HI>Dertford,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cau&s;. 43. E, 3. M. 6.</NOTE> and many parcels of Land that came by E&s;cheat, as held of that Mannor, lying in <HI>Surrey,</HI> after the Death of <HI>Jo.</HI> the Son of <HI>Jo. Adam,</HI> were confirmed to that Foundation by the King: all which returning into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, upon the publike Suppre&s;&s;ion, this Mannor, with its Appendages, was for ever &s;etled by the Crown, on the Company or Brother-hood of the <HI>Haberda&s;hers</HI> in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich</HI> is the next Town to <HI>Detford,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e it &s;tandeth more Ea&s;t-ward then the other, formerly &s;poken of. In Latin named <HI>Viridis Sinus,</HI> in Saxon <HI>Grenawic,</HI> that is, the Green Town, upon the Turning Creeke of the Ri|ver.</P>
<P>In the Time of the <HI>Danes</HI> Inva&s;ion, they often made their Road at this place, and made it remarkable, by their Cruelty, &s;hewed unto <HI>Ealphege</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury:</HI> whom in the year of our Lord, a thou&s;and and twelve, they cruelly executed with mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torments, who&s;e Death together with the cau&s;e there|of <HI>Ditmarius Mer&s;epurgius,</HI> who about the &s;ame time lived, hath thus, in the eighth Book of his Chronicles de&s;cribed. I under&s;tood (&s;aith he) by the relation of
<PB N="162" REF="89"><HI>Sewald,</HI> a pitifull Deed, and therefore memorable, namely, that the perfidious Crew of Norman Souldiers, under <HI>Thurkill,</HI> as yet their Captain, took that excellent Prelate, Arch-bi&s;hop of the Citty of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> named <HI>Ealphege,</HI> with the re&s;t, and them after their wicked manner impri&s;oned and bound, yea and put him to endure Famine, and un&s;peakable pains. This good man moved with humane Frailty, promi&s;eth unto them a Summe of Money, and for the obtaining there|of, did &s;et down a Time between. That if in this Space, he could not by &s;ome acceptable Ran&s;ome, e&s;cape this momentary Death, he might yet in the mean while purge him&s;elf with many a Grone, to be offered as a lively Sacrifice unto the Lord.</P>
<P>But when as the Time and &s;pace appointed were come and gon, this greedy Gulph of Pirats, called forth the Servant of the Lord, and in threatning-wi&s;e demand this Tribute promi&s;ed unto them, to be &s;peedily and out of hand paid. Then he, as a Meek lamb, Here am I, quoth he; ready to undergo, (even for the Love of Chri&s;t) what&s;oever ye pre&s;ume now to do again&s;t me, that I may de&s;erve to become an example of his Servants: and nothing am I troubled at this day. And whereas I &s;eem unto you a Lyer, it is not my own Will, but great need and Poverty that hath done it: This body of mine, which in this Exile I have loved over much, I pre&s;ent as culpable unto you; and I know it is in your Power, to do with it what yee intend: but my &s;infull Soul, that regardeth not you, I hum|bly commend to the Creator of all things. As he was thus &s;peaking, the whole Rabble of the&s;e prophane Wretches hemmed him round about, and getteth to|gether diver&s;e and &s;undry weapons to kill him: which when their Leader <HI>Thurkill</HI> &s;aw a far off, he came quickly running, and crying, do not &s;o I be&s;eech you, and here with my whole heart, I deliver unto you all my Gold and Silver, and what&s;oever I have here, or can by any means come by, &s;ave my Ship only, that you would not &s;in again&s;t the Lord's annointed. But this unbridled anger of his Mates harder then Iron and Flint, was nothing mollified with &s;o gentle Words, and fair Lan|guage of his, but became only pacified by &s;hedding his innocent blood, which pre&s;ent|ly they altogether confounded and bleanded with Ox-heads, Stons as thick as Hail, and Billets hurled at him.</P>
<P>And to the memory of this &s;aid <HI>Ealphege,</HI> is the Pari&s;h Church here con&s;ecrated. But far more &s;plendid hath this &s;umptuous Pallace been, ever &s;ince <HI>Humphrey Duke</HI> of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> Brother to King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, builded the &s;ame, and called it <HI>Placence;</HI> And likewi&s;e the Ca&s;tle, and inclo&s;ed the Park: For doing them both, he had the King's Charter XI. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>Rex concedat quod Humfridus Dux Gloce&s;triae, &amp; Elianora uxor ejus, po&s;&s;dent Karnellare Manerium &s;uum de Ea&s;t-Grenwich, &amp; Impar|care</HI> CC. <HI>Acras terrae inter Manerium &s;uum praedictum.</HI> For it was not lawfull for any man to fortifie his Hou&s;e, or rai&s;e a Ca&s;tle or place of Defence without Licence from the Crown, for Fear of inward Sedition: and was therefore inqui|rable before the E&s;cheator in the twenty fourth Article of his Office. <HI>Item de Ca&s;tellis &amp; Dominicis Karnellatis &s;ine Regis licencia.</HI> The word having its deriva|tion from <HI>Charneux,</HI> whichin French &s;ignifieth the indented Form of the Top of a Wall, which hath vent and cre&s;t, commonly called Imbattelling, becau&s;e it was very &s;erviceable in fight to the Defendant within, who might at the loops or lower places, and other cranies in the Walls and Bulworkes, annoy the Enemy, that a&s;|&s;ayled the &s;ame, and might al&s;o &s;hroud him&s;elf under the higher Parts thereof.</P>
<P>Afterward King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, be&s;towed &s;ome co&s;t, to enlarge this work. <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, followed and beautified the Hou&s;e, with the Addition of the Brick Front to the water &s;ide.

<P>Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> in the time of King <HI>James,</HI> builded that new Brick-work towards the Garden, and laid the Foundation of the Hou&s;e of Delight, towards the Park, which Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> hath &s;o fini&s;hed and furni&s;hed, that it far &s;urpa&s;&s;eth all other of that kind in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P><HI>We&s;tcombe</HI> with its Appendant Members, related to the noble Family of <HI>Bade|le&s;mer,</HI> and upon the Attainder of <HI>artholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badele&s;mer,</HI> e&s;cheating to the Crown, they lay cla&s;ped up in its Revenue; untill King <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd gran|ted them to Sir <HI>Robert Belknap</HI> the Judge; upon who&s;e Attainder, they were gran|ted in Fee to <HI>Robert Ballard</HI> E&s;quire <HI>Pincernae &s;uo</HI> his grand Boteler.

<P>Soon after the Conque&s;t, this <HI>Greenwich,</HI> was parcell of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Li&s;eux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and bore Service, to <HI>Odo</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Baieux,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI> After, the Mannor belonged to the Abbot of St. <HI>Petres</HI> of <HI>Gaunt</HI> in <HI>Flanders,</HI> till &s;uch time, as King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, &s;ei&s;ing in|to his Hands (by occa&s;ion of War) the lands of the Priors Aliens, be&s;towed it together with the Mannor of <HI>Lew&s;ham,</HI> and many other Lands al&s;o, upon the Priory of the Brotherhood to the Monks of <HI>Shene</HI> which he had then newly erected, to which it remained till the Time of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, who annexed it to the Crown, unto which it now belongeth, and is called the Honor <HI>Ea&s;t-Greenwich.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> were both born here; and King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, a Miracle of Princely Towardne&s;&s;e, ended his Life, in the &s;ame Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, 1376, in the fifty fir&s;t year of his Reign founded the Religious Hou&s;e of Friers Aliens, or Dominican Friers. Sir <HI>John Norbury</HI> Knight, high Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> is reckoned a Benefactor to the &s;ame, after the Di&s;&s;o|lution of this Hou&s;e, and its Annexion to <HI>Shene</HI> by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P>Another Hou&s;e of ob&s;ervant Friers was erected here, by King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, as we read in <HI>Jo. Ro&s;&s;e. Circiter Annum Regni Edwardi quarti, venerunt Fratres ob|&s;ervantes Ordinis Minorum ad Greenwich, &amp; habebant Cantariam &amp; Capellam Sancti Crucis.</HI> And King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, builded that Hou&s;e for them adjoyning to the Pallace, which is yet there to be &s;een.</P>
<P>There are moreover in the Town, two Colledges or Almes hou&s;es, for the Su&s;ten|tation of poor Per&s;ons, the one builded by <HI>William Lambert</HI> E&s;quire, which he named the Colledge of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> poor People, and as the Prying Adver|&s;aries of out Religion then ob&s;erved, was the fir&s;t Prote&s;tant that built an Ho&s;|pital.</P>
<P>The other &s;tanding by <HI>Thames</HI>-&s;ide, was founded by <HI>Henry Howard,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> Lord Privy Seal, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, and Knight of the Garter. And inlarged and Beautified the Ca&s;tle, (which is famous in the Spani&s;h Fables) from whence there is a mo&s;t fair and plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect open to the Ri|ver, winding in and out, almo&s;t redoubling of it &s;elf, the green Medows and Mar&s;hes underlying the Citty of <HI>London,</HI> and Country round about.

<P>And al&s;o for a <HI>L'env'oy</HI> to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> you may read the Ver&s;es of <HI>Leland</HI> the <HI>Anti|quarian</HI> Poet adjoyning to <HI>Greenwich. Blackheath,</HI> of which the Hundred taketh the name, &s;o called of the colour of the Earth, or Bleacheath of the high and cold Situation, for bleak &s;ignifieth cold. Al&s;o <HI>Campus Martis,</HI> it may well be cal|led: for be&s;ides the Burthen of the Dani&s;h Camps, it hath born three rebellious A&s;&s;emblies. One in the time of King <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, Moved, as &s;hall be farther declared in <HI>Offham,</HI> by <HI>John Tylar,</HI> whom <HI>William Walworth,</HI> then Maior of <HI>London,</HI> &s;lew with his Dagger in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and thereupon, upon the Tradition
<PB N="164" REF="90">comes, that the City had given them, for an Augmentation to their <HI>E&s;chochen,</HI> a Dag|ger in the Dexter-point or Canton, &s;o to be born by them for ever.</P>
<P><HI>Jack Cade</HI> that Counterfeit <HI>Mortimer,</HI> and his Crew, conducted the &s;econd, who araying them&s;elves here, and pa&s;&s;ed to <HI>London,</HI> where they did to Death the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and others, and executed their malice upon the Records and Monuments of the Law; Burning down the Office of Armes, which was then kept at <HI>Cole-Harbour,</HI> burning, de&s;troying their Rolls, Regi&s;ters, and Books of Armory; Their main Drift and De&s;ign, being to bring in Parity.</P>
<P>And their In&s;urrection was here a&s;&s;embled, by <HI>Michaell Jo&s;eph</HI> Black-&s;mith, and the Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> under the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh; at which time they and their Complices received their ju&s;t De&s;ert: the Common Numbers of them, being di&s;comfited and &s;lain, and the Leaders them&s;elves, taken, drawn and hanged.</P>
<P>Of this la&s;t, there remaineth yet, to be &s;een upon the Heath, the place of the Smith's Tent, called commonly his Forge; and of all, there the great grave-Hills of &s;uch as were buryed, after the overthrow. The&s;e Hills, in the We&s;t-Country, upon diver&s;e Champions and Plains (where is no &s;mall Store of the Like) are called <HI>Barowes,</HI> of the old Engli&s;h word <HI>Burghes;</HI> which la&s;t word, melted into Buryings, (being a Spring of the old Stock) we do yet retain alive.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and la&s;t of the&s;e Commotions were &s;tirred of Grie&s;e, the Common people conceived for the Demand of two Sub&s;idies. Of which the one was un|rea&s;onable, becau&s;e it was taxed upon the Polls, and exempted none. The other was un&s;ea&s;onable, for that it was exacted, when the heads of the common people were full of <HI>Perkin Warbeck.</HI></P>
<P>The third and middlemo&s;t, grew upon a grudge, that the People took for yielding the Dutchie of <HI>Aniou,</HI> and <HI>Maine,</HI> to the King of <HI>Sicily:</HI> The coming of who&s;e Daughter, (after that the King would needs have her to Wife, notwith&s;tanding, his precontract made with the Earl of <HI>Armenac</HI>) was not &s;o joyfully embraced, by the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> upon <HI>Blackheath,</HI> wearing their red Hoods, Badges, and blew Gowns, as in Sequele the Marriage and whole Government it &s;elf, was known to be dete&s;ted of the Country Commons, by bearing in the &s;ame place, Harne&s;&s;e, Bowes, Bills, and other Weapons. Thus far, the Story of <HI>Blackheath</HI> proves but &s;ad and tragical: That which remains, is of a more glorious and &s;plendid condi|tion, con&s;i&s;ting of Ovations and Triumphs; for when the Emperour of <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI> came to require Aid again&s;t the Turks, King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, with all Princely re&s;pect, went to meet him at this place, and &s;o conducted him to <HI>London.</HI> And when King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, returned from his victorious Conque&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> the Lord Maior and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> went forth in their be&s;t Equi|page, to attend his Reception at this place, at which time the King made many Knights Bannerets; And K. <HI>Hen.</HI> the eighth, that excelled in all Triumphal matters met <HI>Anne Cleve,</HI> daughter to the Dake of <HI>Cleve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Graveney</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Boughton,</HI> was in the year of our Lord eight hun|dred and eleven, by Archbi&s;hop <HI>&V;lfred,</HI> bought of King <HI>Kenwolfe,</HI> (as the Book of <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> &s;ets it forth,) <HI>ad opus Eccle&s;iae Chri&s;ti,</HI> to the repair of the Cathe|dral.

<P><HI>Grave&s;end</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Toltingtrow,</HI> was anciently the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Fa|mily called <HI>Cramavill,</HI> who had likewi&s;e very con&s;iderable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in <HI>Ea&s;t-Kent.

<P><HI>Milton</HI> neer <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> was an Ingredient which made up that E&s;tate, which fell under the Signory of the <HI>Montchen&s;eys,</HI> Lords and Barons of <HI>Swan&s;camp.

Afterwards, this Mannor was linked to the Revenue of the Crown, but whether it was thus annexed by Sale, or by Exchange, I confe&s;&s;e, I am ignorant: only I find by the original Patent, that in the &s;ixth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, it was granted to Sir <HI>Simon de Bur|ley;</HI> upon who&s;e Attaint, in the tenth year of the above&s;aid Prince, it devolved to the Crown, and <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, not long after, &s;etled it on the Abby of St. <HI>Mary Grace</HI> on <HI>Tower-Hill,</HI> in who&s;e Revenue it remained untill King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth tore it off by the Publique Di&s;&s;olution, and united it to the Royall Re|venue, where it had its fixed aboad, untill the thirteenth year of King <HI>James:</HI> and then it was granted to Mr. <HI>William Salter;</HI> who not many years after, pa&s;&s;ed it away to Mr. <HI>James Cri&s;pe;</HI> from whom in our Memory, partly by Purcha&s;e, and partly by Exchange, it went over to Mr. <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Gillingham,</HI> was a Mannor always relating to the Arch-bi&s;hops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> though the Donation by the Book of <HI>Chri&s;t-church</HI> be not &s;pecified.

<P><HI>Ea&s;t-court,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-court</HI> in this Pari&s;h, were anciently knit together, and re&s;ided in a Family called <HI>Gillingham.

<P><HI>Goodwen&s;ton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> was the ancient Seat of <HI>Chich.</HI> The fir&s;t of Eminence, was <HI>Ernaldus Chich,</HI> who was a man of principall Account in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, and King <HI>John:</HI> nor were they more eminent here, then they were at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where they had large Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and unto them did the Aldermanry of <HI>Burgate</HI> appertain. <HI>Thomas Chich</HI> of <HI>Goodwen&s;ton,</HI> was a prime Benefactor, to the Church of St. <HI>Mary Bredmin</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where his Name together with his Effigies are in an old Character &s;et up, in the We&s;t-window, as his Coat is likewi&s;e in the Chancel, in&s;culped in Stone-work. He was Bailiff of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> an Office not contemptible in tho&s;e Times, in the year 1259, and again in the year 1271. <HI>Thomas Chich,</HI> this mans Son, was She|riff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the forty fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Goodwen&s;ton. Thomas Chich,</HI> this Mans Son, was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> likewi&s;e in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and he was Grandfather to <HI>Valentine Chich,</HI> who matched with <HI>Philippa</HI> Daughter and Heir of Sir <HI>Robert Chichley,</HI> Brother to <HI>Henry Chichley,</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but dyed without I&s;&s;ue-male: &s;o that his three Si&s;ters and Coheirs wedded to <HI>Kemp, Judde,</HI> and <HI>Martin,</HI> &s;hared his In|heritance, and by a joint Con&s;ent, about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, pa&s;&s;ed away their E&s;tate here and at <HI>Ewell,</HI> in this pari&s;h, to <HI>Pordage</HI> of <HI>Rodmer|&s;ham:</HI> and from this Name about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it pa&s;&s;ed a|way to <HI>Fagg</HI> de&s;cended from the <HI>Faggs</HI> of <HI>Willesborough,</HI> where I find by the Court Rolls of the Mannor of <HI>Brabourne,</HI> that one <HI>Andrew Fagge</HI> held Lands there of that Mannor, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.

<P><HI>Goodne&s;ton</HI> by <HI>Wingham</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Gon&s;ton,</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Wingham</HI> and was formerly parcell of the Patrimony of <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> bequea|thed to him by his Kin&s;man <HI>John de Ha&s;tings;</HI> who was fir&s;t Husband to <HI>Juliana,</HI> the Heir generall of <HI>Roger de Leybourn.

<P><HI>Rolling,</HI> is a third place in this Pari&s;h to be taken notice of: It contributed a Seat as well as a Sirname, formerly, to a Family called <HI>Rolling.

<P><HI>Goudher&s;t</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Marden,</HI> with the inherent Mannor of <HI>Bedgebury,</HI> were the ancient Patrimony of a Family of no cheap Account in this Track, which, as it cho&s;e one of the&s;e Mannors for its Seat, &s;o did it derive its Sirname from thence likewi&s;e, and was called <HI>Bedgbury,</HI> and certainly were of a very high A&s;cent in their Extraction.

<P><HI>Finchcocks</HI> is a third place of note in this Pari&s;h, made more eminent in that it was the Man&s;ion of a Family of that Sirname, whom, although I find inve&s;ted in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, ever &s;ince the fortieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, yet do I not di&s;cover that any of the Family was illu&s;trious by any important under|taking, or famous by any eminent Office. The next Family which &s;tept into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was <HI>Horden</HI> of <HI>Horden;</HI> and he became Proprietary of it by Purcha&s;e about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, one of which Family was <HI>Edward Hor|den</HI> E&s;quire, who was Knight of the Greencloth to <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, Queen <HI>Mary</HI> and Queen <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> who dyed without I&s;&s;ue-male, and left his E&s;tate to be &s;hared between two Daughters and Coheirs, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> matched to Mr. <HI>Paul Bat|hur&s;t,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>Bathur&s;t</HI> Street in <HI>Nordiam,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed to Mr. <HI>Delves</HI> of <HI>Fletchings,</HI> who in her Right carried away <HI>Horden,</HI> where certainly, the above-recited Family had flouri&s;hed under a noble E&s;timate; for <HI>Edward Horden</HI> the la&s;t of this Name was i&s;&s;ued out from <HI>William Chichley,</HI> &s;econd Brother to <HI>Henry Chichley</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> and for &s;ome con&s;iderable Service performed to the Crown, had the Augmentation of a Regal <HI>Diadem,</HI> upon a <HI>Canton</HI> added to his paternal Coat, by Queen <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> But to proceed, <HI>Finchcocks</HI> by the above-mentioned match, devolved to be the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bathur&s;t,</HI> and &s;o owns it &s;elf at this Day, to be the E&s;tate of this Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Patenden</HI> is another place which gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of no vul|gar Repute in this County, and was &s;eated in its Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as appears by ori|ginal Deeds and other old Records, as high as the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and where, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, there was i&s;&s;ued out a Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>Gervas Clifton</HI> E&s;quire, then Sheriff of the County, to return all tho&s;e, who did <HI>portare Arma antiqua.</HI> Among&s;t the Regi&s;ter and Catalogue of tho&s;e who were then returned, <HI>Patenden</HI> is recorded, who was Lord of this place, and from him did the Propriety of this place by De&s;cent glide down to his Suc|ce&s;&s;or, who, in tho&s;e Times we &s;tyle our Fathers, pa&s;&s;ed it away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Bathur&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Twi&s;den,</HI> is a fifth place, which invites us to a Survey.

The fir&s;t, that I find by Deed to be of this Family, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, was <HI>Adam de Twi&s;den,</HI> and he was &s;ei&s;ed of it,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>This</HI> Rog.

The Cre&s;t, which, at this Day, is annexed to the paternal Coat of this Family, a rare thing in tho&s;e Times when Cre&s;ts were infrequent and unu&s;uall, and began to be cu&s;tomary, when tho&s;e eminent Familyes who were embarked in the two Factions, of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> a&s;&s;umed them to &s;erve as Evidences or Symbols of Di&s;tin|ction, whereby the Son might avoid the plunging his Sword in the Bowells of his Father, or a Brother the Sheathing his in the Entrails of his Brother. But to proceed, the la&s;t of this Name, who po&s;&s;e&s;t this place, was <HI>Roger Twi&s;den,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>H.</HI> the &s;ixth, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Roger Twi&s;den,</HI> and he imme|diately after conveyed it by Sale to <HI>Geffrey Allen,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>H.</HI> the &s;ixth, &s;etled the Right of it by Deed in <HI>Thomas Windhill.</HI> And thus far do the Copies of diver&s;e original Evidences, which relate to this Place, extend and no farther.

<P><HI>Halsted</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Cod&s;heath</HI> was the Inheritance of a good old Family called <HI>Malavill,</HI> who were of no contemptible Account in this part of the County; for in the Pipe-Rols, relating to the Raign of King <HI>John,</HI> I di&s;cover, that <HI>Robert de Malavill</HI> was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae A&s;&s;i&s;ae,</HI> in the fourth year of that Prince, and then again in the &s;eventh year of his Rule, he was dignified with that eminent Place of Tru&s;t, and he had I&s;&s;ue <HI>William de Malavil,</HI> who was in the enjoyment of this Mannor at his Death, which was in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears by an e&s;cheat Roll, marked with the number 56.

<P><HI>Harbledowne</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>We&s;tgate,</HI> though at pre&s;ent but an ob&s;cure Village, and not of much Eminence, was in Time of more ancient Date famous for three memorable Places.

<P>The &s;econd was <HI>Polres,</HI> which anciently had and &s;till keeps the Repute of a Man|nor; <HI>John de Polre,</HI> Son of <HI>John de Polre</HI> payd re&s;pective Aid for it, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and when after &s;ome expiration of Time, this Family began to find the common Sepulcher which wairs upon all Humane Glory, Decay and Oblivion; the <HI>Martins,</HI> a Name of generous extraction in this Track, &s;tept in and by Purcha&s;e became Lords of the Fee, and held it, till the Name being con|tracted into <HI>Anne</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir of <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Nether-Hardres</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bridge</HI> and <HI>Petham,</HI> is eminent for two Places &s;itu|ated within the Precincts and Ambuts of it.

<P><HI>Hartley</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Ac&s;tane,</HI> made up a part of that Patrimony, which came within the Circle of that Revenue, which owned for Proprietaries the Lords <HI>Mont|chen&s;ey,</HI> who&s;e capitall Seat was at <HI>Swan&s;camp,</HI> where I &s;hall treat more largely of them; but it &s;eems they had a &s;pecial regard to this Mannor, for <HI>Warren de Montchen&s;ey,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to <HI>Hartley</HI> in the thirty &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it enobled and &s;ecured with this Franchi&s;e to his only Son, <HI>William de Montchen&s;ey,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Joan</HI> his Si&s;ter and Heir by marching with <HI>William de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> entituled him to this Mannor, and &s;he held it at her Death, which was in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the &s;econd: from whom it devolved to her Son <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue-male in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> &s;econd; <HI>I&s;abell de Valence</HI> his Heir Generall, united it to the Inheritance of her Husband <HI>Lawrence de Ha&s;tings,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> from whom it came down to his Grandchild <HI>John de Ha&s;tings.</HI> And he decea&s;ing without I&s;&s;ue, in the year 1389, left it to his Kin&s;man <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> and he brings a pleading for this and other Land, again&s;t <HI>John le Scroope,</HI> in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and in the &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, as appears by the Book of <HI>Dover</HI> in the Exchequer, he was peaceably fixed in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and was a per&s;on of con&s;iderable Rank and importance in tho&s;e Times, for he bore a pair of gilt Spurs at the Coronation of the above&s;aid Prince. But no eminence of Birth or Dignity can chain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a place to a Family, when the Title leans upon the Wheel of an incon&s;tant and ebbing E&s;tate. For the Revolution of Sale about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, carried it from this Name to <HI>Penhale,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Em|ma Penhale,</HI> as appears by the Book of <HI>Dover</HI> in the Exchequer, held it in the &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, but the Propriety was not long con&s;tant in this Family: for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, I find it in the Te|nure of <HI>Cre&s;&s;ell,</HI> but it was not long permanent in this Family neither: for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was by Sale tran&s;planted into <HI>Ballard,</HI> and here the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion re&s;ted untill the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth; and then it was alienated to <HI>William Sydley</HI> E&s;quire, Ance&s;tor to Sir <HI>Charles Sydley</HI> Baronet, who now is entituled to the Right and Propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Ha&s;tingleigh</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Bircholt,</HI> did anciently confe&s;&s;e the noble Fami|ly of <HI>Haut,</HI> to be its Proprietaries, and was in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion untill the begin|ning of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and then <HI>Edward Haut</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Robert Poy|nings</HI>

<P><HI>Hawking</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkstone</HI> contains two little Mannors within its Verge, which mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed over in Silence.

<P><HI>Kel&s;ham</HI> is a third Seat in this Pari&s;h, which may challenge our Con&s;ideration; becau&s;e it was the Re&s;idence formerly (though now transformed into a Farm-hou&s;e) of Gentlemen known by this Sirname, who might have been ranged and mar&s;hal|led among&s;t the prime Gentlemen of this County, and bare for their Coat-<HI>Armour Sable,</HI> a <HI>Fe&s;&s;e</HI> engrailed <HI>Argent,</HI> between three <HI>Garbes, Or.</HI> One of them &s;tood depicted in coloured Gla&s;&s;e in the Church windows, with his <HI>Arms</HI> upon his <HI>Tabard;</HI> but by the A&s;&s;aults of Age, and other wild and &s;acrilegious Impre&s;&s;ions, is now utterly defaced and demoli&s;hed; nor is the Family in any better condition, that having many years &s;ince de&s;erted the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Place; for about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it was conveyed to <HI>John&s;on:</HI> from whom very lately, it is come over by Purcha&s;e to <HI>Stringer.</HI></P>

And here is much Land in this Pari&s;h, which bears the Name of <HI>Pend,</HI> a probable Argument of the Antiquity of it in this Track: nor did it yeild to Time, or de&s;ert the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Place, but was con&s;tant in the Tenure of it, until that Age we call our Grand-fathers, and then it was alie|nated to a Family called <HI>Dominie, alias Fullaker;</HI> the la&s;t of which Name at this Place was <HI>Chri&s;topher Dominie, alias Fullaker,</HI> who not many years &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed it away to Mr. <HI>John Hulks</HI> of <HI>Newenham,</HI> who&s;e Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Stephen Hulks,</HI> does now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e the Signory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Heriet&s;ham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> was anciently a Limb of that E&s;tate which was entituled to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Noble Family of <HI>Cre&s;cy: Hugh de Cre&s;cy</HI> died &s;ei&s;ed of the Mannor, in the forty &s;eventh year of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and his Grand-mother <HI>Margery</HI> was Daughter of <HI>William de Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Patricks|bourne Cheyney,</HI> as appears <HI>Clau&s;.</HI> 52. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 6. <HI>in Dor&s;o.</HI> But he de|cea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue, and &s;o his Brother <HI>Stephen de Cre&s;cy</HI> became his Heir and Lord of <HI>Heriet&s;ham,</HI> and in this Family it continued until the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and then the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Place went from <HI>Cre&s;cy</HI> into <HI>Northwood,</HI> as is manife&s;t by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> where <HI>Roger de Northwood</HI> is repre&s;ented to have held this Mannor, and have paid a proportionate <HI>Aid</HI> for it, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and he decea&s;ed &s;ei&s;ed of it in the thirty fifth year of that King's Raign.

<P><HI>Hernehill</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Boughton,</HI> has two Places in it, which may make it remarkable: Fir&s;t, <HI>Durgall Stroude,</HI> which was, in Times of higher Track, the <HI>Martin's</HI> a very noble and illu&s;trious Family in this Territory, who&s;e capital or principal Seat was at <HI>Graveney,</HI> not far di&s;tant: and here, after it had flouri&s;ht, by the Decur&s;ion of &s;ome Ages, it fell into a Daughter and Heir, called <HI>Margaret,</HI> Sole Daughter and Heir to <HI>Matthew Martin,</HI> who was married to <HI>William Norton</HI> of <HI>Coke&s;di&s;h</HI> in <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and in her Right did he become Proprietary of this Man|nor, from who&s;e Heir <HI>Thomas Norton,</HI> the Property or Fee-&s;imple was by Sale tran&s;|ferred into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Sir <HI>John Wild</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to who&s;e Heirs General the Propriety of this Mannor does at pre&s;ent relate.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is another Seat in this Pari&s;h, vulgarly called <HI>Apes Court, alias Lockley;</HI> but, indeed, in truer Orthography writ <HI>Epes-Court,</HI> a place &s;o de&s;picable, that it had not been worth the Memoriall, but that in all the circum&s;tances of pro|bability the <HI>Epes</HI>'s of <HI>Canterbury</HI> a&s;&s;umed, if not Seat, yet at lea&s;t Sirname from thence; and it is the more po&s;&s;ible, becau&s;e the <HI>Epes's</HI> have been ancient Tenants to the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for the Mannor of <HI>Seas-alter,</HI> divided by a neer Di&s;tance from this place; in Ages of a more modern Date, the <HI>Nevin&s;ons</HI> were the Lords of the Fee, and certainly this was their ancient Man&s;ion, before they were tran&s;|planted to <HI>Ea&s;try;</HI> this being &s;old in the Raign of King <HI>James</HI> by Sir <HI>Roger Nevin&s;on</HI> to Sir <HI>John Wild</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in who&s;e Heirs General (<HI>Dudley Wild</HI> E&s;quire, his only &s;urviving Son being lately decea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue) the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion continues fixed.</P>

<P><HI>Hoo</HI> gives Name to the Hundred wherein it is &s;ituated, and was a principal Branch of that Revenue, which fell under the Dominion of <HI>Bardolfe: Robert de Bardolfe</HI> held it under the Notion of a whole Knights Fee, as appears by the red Book kept in the Exchequer, in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd: and from him it came down to <HI>Hugh Bardolfe,</HI> who was rated for it after the &s;ame Account, in the &s;econd year of <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t; but <HI>Hugh</HI> Lord <HI>Bardolfe</HI> his Son, not long after concluded in three Daughters and Co-heirs. <HI>Mawde</HI> was matched to <HI>Nicholas Points, Margaret</HI> was married to <HI>Robert Aguillon,</HI> and <HI>I&s;olda</HI> was e&s;pou&s;ed to <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Cod|nor,</HI> which divided the Inheritance of that Family at this Place.

<P><HI>Higham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Shamell,</HI> had anciently a Nunnery: but the original Chartularies, and other Records being lo&s;t, the Founder is unknown.

Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badele&s;mere,</HI> Steward of the Hou&s;hold to <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, in the &s;econd year of that Prince, gave it in Franke-marriage with his Daughter <HI>Joane Badele&s;mere</HI> to <HI>John de Northwood;</HI> and that this was Cu&s;to|mary in that Age, wherein the Times were dry for any pecuniary Supply, is mo&s;t certain; for <HI>John de Northwood,</HI> this mans great Grand-child, in the eighth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, gave it in Franke-marriage with his Daughter to <HI>Chri&s;topher Shukborough</HI> of the County of <HI>Warwick</HI> E&s;quire, and he in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>Gregory Ballard</HI> E&s;quire, who&s;e Po&s;terity for many years did &s;ucce&s;&s;ively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it, until <HI>Nicolas Ballard,</HI> in the fourth year of <HI>Philip</HI> and <HI>Mary,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away by Sale to <HI>Roger Trollop</HI> E&s;quire; and he in the &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> by Bargain and Sale demi&s;ed his Intere&s;t in it to Sir <HI>Edward Warner,</HI> then Lievtenant of the Tower, and he in the &s;ixteenth year of the Govern|ment of that Prince&s;s, conveyed it to Sir <HI>Roger Manwood,</HI> Lord chief Baron of the Exchequer, who&s;e Son Sir <HI>Peter Manwood,</HI> almo&s;t in our Fathers Memory, di&s;po&s;ed of his Right in it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Tolderbye,</HI> who left it to his Son Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Tolderbye,</HI> and, he decea&s;ing without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Jane</HI> his only Si&s;ter and Heir, by matching with Sir <HI>Robert Darell</HI> of <HI>Cale-hill</HI> (a man eminent both by his Integrity and Ho&s;pitality, according to the accu&s;tomed Genius, which alwaies waited on this Family) brought it to be po&s;&s;e&s;t by that Name; upon who&s;e Decea&s;e it devolved to his &s;econd Son Mr. <HI>Edward Darell,</HI> who is the pre&s;ent Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There was an eager Conte&s;t between <HI>John Beckford</HI> Vicar of <HI>Chartham,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;topher Shukborough</HI> E&s;quire, Lord of <HI>Horton,</HI> touching the celebration of Divine Offices in the Chappel at <HI>Horton;</HI> as likewi&s;e the Admini&s;tration of the Sacraments: and it was improved to that Animo&s;ity, that there was a mutual Ap|peal made to <HI>William Courtney,</HI> then Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> who directed a Commi&s;&s;ion to <HI>John Barnett</HI> his Official, in the year 1380. to hear and determine the Controver&s;ie, and upon a &s;erious &s;ifting and winnowing this whole Affair, the Debate was wound up upon this Conclu&s;ion, that there &s;hould be a &s;olemnization of all Divine Offices in the above mentioned Chappel, <HI>exceptis tantum D. functorum Sepulturis &amp; ex&s;equiis,</HI> only the Dead were to receive their enterment in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Chartham.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hothfeild</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart, Longbridge,</HI> and <HI>Cale-hill,</HI> was wrapt up in the Demea&s;ne of the Lord <HI>Badele&s;mer,</HI> who held it in Grand Serjeanty of the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> that is, he was to &s;erve up water to the Arch-bi&s;hop at his In&s;tallment or Inthronization to wa&s;h his Hands, and had <HI>Pelvim &amp; Lotorium;</HI> &s;o are the Words of the Record: he was rewarded with the Ve&s;&s;el which contained the Water, and likewi&s;e the Towel which dried his Hands, and he was likewi&s;e to be his Chamberlin the Night of his In&s;talment, and was recompen&s;ed with the Arch-bi&s;hops Bed, as his Guerdon. <HI>Bartholomew de Badele&s;mere</HI> Son of <HI>Guncelin,</HI> died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot.

<PB N="194" REF="105">A&s;&s;ociation with the Rebellious Nobility, having in the &s;ixteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, forfeited this to the Crown; it lay entwined with the Royal Revenue, until <HI>Edward</HI> the third, in the &s;econd year of his Raign, re&s;tored it to his Son <HI>Bartholomew de Badele&s;mere,</HI> who in the twelfth year of that Prince's Government, dying without I&s;&s;ue, his four Si&s;ters became his Co-heirs, whereof <HI>Margaret</HI> mar|ried to the Lord <HI>William Ro&s;&s;e</HI> of <HI>Hamlake,</HI> ca&s;t this Mannor into the Inheritance of that Family, and he in her Right died &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

And from him, did the Title by a lineal tran&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, pa&s;&s;e down to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Ro&s;&s;e,</HI> who vigorou&s;ly endevouring to &s;up|port the &s;inking Title of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> was by <HI>John Nevill</HI> Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Montacute,</HI> di&s;comfited in the North, and taken Pri&s;oner, and after beheaded at <HI>Newca&s;tle,</HI> upon who&s;e Dy&s;a&s;trous Tragedy, this Mannor was laid hold on by the Crown, as an E&s;cheat: and King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in the fourth year of his Go|vernment, granted it to Sir <HI>John Fogge</HI> of <HI>Repton</HI> for Life only, who was Trea|&s;urer of his Hou&s;hold, and one of his Privie-Councel; and whom King <HI>Richard</HI> the third, invited afterward out of the Abbey of <HI>We&s;t-min&s;ter,</HI> where he had taken Sanctuary for fear of &s;ome Mi&s;chief, intended him by that U&s;urper; and in the pre|&s;ence of a numerous A&s;&s;embly, gave him his Hand, and bad him be confident, that he was thenceforth &s;ure unto him in Affection. This I mention, the rather, becau&s;e divers of our Chronicles, have erroneou&s;ly mentioned, that he was an Attorney, whom this Prince pardoned for Forgery. But to proceed: After the Decea&s;e of Sir <HI>John Fogge,</HI> who dyed in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted it to <HI>John Tufton</HI> E&s;quire, Ance&s;tor to the right honorable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet,</HI> who now by paternal Right, claims the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><HI>Swinfort</HI> is a Mannor in <HI>Hothfield,</HI> which afforded a Sirname to a Family &s;o called: but whether Sir <HI>Otho Swinfort,</HI> Husband to <HI>Katharine Swinfort,</HI> who was af|terwards Concubine to <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Gaunt,</HI> was extracted from this Family or not, is in|certain; becau&s;e I cannot di&s;cover they were ever of any Eminence. In <HI>Henry</HI> the fifths Reign, I find it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Bridges,</HI> de&s;cended from <HI>John at Bregg,</HI> one of tho&s;e eminent per&s;ons, that are depicted kneeling in Coat Armour, in a Window in <HI>Great Chart Church.</HI> And there is a place in that Pari&s;h, which &s;till bears the Name of this Family, and is called <HI>Bridge,</HI> being divorced by no great di&s;tance from this Mannor: and in this Family did the Pro|priety of this place continue, untill the latter end of King <HI>James;</HI> and then it pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale from <HI>Bridges,</HI> to Sir <HI>Nicholas Tufton</HI> Father to the right ho|nourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet,</HI> the in&s;tant Owner of it.</P>
<P><HI>Faule&s;ley,</HI> vulgarly now called <HI>Fau&s;ley</HI> and <HI>Fou&s;ley,</HI> was the Patrimony of a Fami|ly, which borrowed not only its Source and Extraction, but its Denomination likewi&s;e from hence. Sir <HI>John Faule&s;ley,</HI> was an eminent per&s;on, in the Raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, being frequently in his Time, as appears by the late printed Abridgement of the Records in the Tower, &s;ummoned to &s;it in Parliament as Baron: but although this Family was made eminent by this worthy per&s;on, who was an elder Branch of this Stem; yet in &s;ucceeding Generations it began to crum|ble away, into Ob&s;curity and Decay: and was at la&s;t ground to &s;o narrow a pro|portion of E&s;tate, that about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> this Mannor, which had &s;o long been e&s;pou&s;ed to the Intere&s;t of this Name and Family, was carried off by Sale to <HI>Drury;</HI> in which Family it was re&s;ident, untill the latter end of that Prince&s;&s;e, and then it was alienated to <HI>Paris;</HI> who immediately af|ter conveyed it to <HI>Bull;</HI> and he tran&s;planted his Right by Sale again into the &s;ame Family; from whom, a like Vici&s;&s;itude brought it to be the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Nicholas Tufton,</HI> Father to the right honorable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> now Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it.</P>
<P><HI>At Hothfield,</HI> in a field not far removed from <HI>Ripley,</HI> a Mannor belonging to <HI>Alexander Iden</HI> E&s;quire, was <HI>Jack Cade</HI> that Counterfeit <HI>Mortimer</HI> (who was mufled up, in that Name, by the Hou&s;e of <HI>York,</HI> only to fathom the depth of the peo|ple's Affection to their Title, which was to take its Ri&s;e from that per&s;on) en|countered, and in a &s;ingle Combat, offered up to the Ju&s;tice of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, by
<PB N="195" REF="105">the above&s;aid <HI>Alexander Iden,</HI> who was not only by that Prince, recompen&s;ed with a con&s;iderable Reward, for &s;o important a piece of Service, but likewi&s;e in|ve&s;ted with the Honour of Knighthood, the pre&s;ent Age wherein he lived, admi|red him; nor &s;hall there be any Hi&s;tory for the future, which &s;hall not Record him. From the Heir Generall of this Family, is Mr. <HI>George Brown</HI> E&s;quire, late|ly of <HI>Spelmonden</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and now of <HI>Buckland</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> by his Grand-mother originally de&s;cended.</P>
<P><HI>Hougham</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Bew borough</HI> and <HI>Folkstone</HI> gave Seat and Sirname to a Family of as reverend an E&s;timate for Antiquity, as any in this Track. <HI>Robert de Hougham,</HI> dyed &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the forty fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it to his Son

But in the next De&s;cent, this Family was entombed in two Daughters and Coheirs, one was mar|ried to <HI>John de Shelving,</HI> and the other to <HI>Waretius de Valoigns,</HI> who in her Right entered upon the Inheritance, and in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Hougham,</HI> but enjoyed nei|ther his new acquired Priviledge or Inheritance long; for before the lat|ter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, he dyed, and left a large Inheritance to be &s;hared by his two Daughters and Coheirs, one whereof was wedded to Sir <HI>Thomas Fogge</HI> of <HI>Toniford,</HI> and the other to <HI>Thomas de Aldon,</HI> to who&s;e Revenue upon the Partition, this was annexed, and he was found in the enjoyment of it at his Death, which was in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Little Hougham,</HI> is a &s;econd Mannor in this Pari&s;h: It was, in Ages of a very high A&s;cent, the Revenue of the ancient Family of <HI>Ba&s;ing. William de Ba&s;ing,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 21. From whom it de&s;ceuded to his Grandchild <HI>John Ba&s;ing,</HI> who dyed in the Tenure of it, in the &s;eventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 6. Af|ter who&s;e Decea&s;e, it continued in the Name, untill the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Clive,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Cliffe,</HI> a Family of eminent Account, in the Counties of <HI>Salop</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Family it dwelt, untill the latter end of that Prince, and then by Purcha&s;e, it was made the Patrimony of <HI>Hextall,</HI> a Eamily who extracted their original, out of <HI>Stafford&s;hire;</HI> and here it re&s;ided, untill the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it was tran&s;mitted by a Daughter and Heir to <HI>Whetenhall;</HI> who &s;old it to <HI>John Bois</HI> E&s;quire, Ance&s;tor to <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Maxton</HI> is a third place, which mu&s;t not be waved in this Di&s;cour&s;e: It was in elder Times divided between two Families called <HI>Madekin,</HI> and <HI>Wal&s;ham. Ste|phen de Madekin,</HI> was not only Lord of <HI>Madekin</HI> in <HI>Denton,</HI> and the Moiety of this place, in the year one thou&s;and &s;eventy and &s;even, but likewi&s;e Land at <HI>Canterbu|ry,</HI> as appears by Mr. <HI>Sompner,</HI> in his Survey of that City, page 415. And <HI>Will. de Wal&s;ham,</HI> who in the thirty &s;eventh year, was po&s;&s;e&s;t of the other Moiety of this place gave, about that year by Charter, &s;ome land to the Incumbent or Par&s;on of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> of <HI>Harbledown.</HI> After the&s;e two Families had de&s;erted the Inheritance, I find the <HI>Archers,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to be entituled by Pur|cha&s;e to it, and <HI>William le Archer</HI> (&s;o he is written in the Book of <HI>Aid</HI>) paid an Auxiliary Supply for this Mannor, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at
<PB N="196" REF="106">making the Black Prince Knight; but his Son <HI>VVilliam Archer,</HI> in the twenty fir&s;t year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, pa&s;&s;es away his Right by Sale to <HI>John Alkham</HI> of <HI>Alk|ham,</HI> a Family that had taken deep Root in Antiquity downwards, and had a &s;preading Revenue upwards in this Track; but, before the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, were con&s;umed and crumbled away, and then the next Family which &s;ucceeded in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was <HI>Herman,</HI> who was likewi&s;e owner of <HI>Mary-place</HI> in <HI>Crayford,</HI> and in this Name did the Intere&s;t of it fix, until the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Andrews,</HI> who &s;ome few years after demi&s;ed the Fee-&s;imple to <HI>Pepper,</HI> and he almo&s;t in the Verge of our Remembrance &s;old it to Sir <HI>Thomas VVilford</HI> of <HI>Ilden,</HI> and he in our Memory alienated it to <HI>Richards</HI> of <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P>Although the greate&s;t part of this Mannor was of &s;ecular Concernment, yet I find that the Prior of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in <HI>Dover</HI> had &s;ome Intere&s;t in it, as appears by an Inqui&s;ition taken after the Death of <HI>John Atte-hall,</HI> where it is proved in the &s;ix|teenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Numb.</HI> 129. <HI>Parte &s;ecunda,</HI> that he held Lands at his Death at <HI>Maxton</HI> of that Covent.</P>
<P><HI>Siber&s;ton</HI> is the la&s;t place of Account in <HI>Hougham;</HI> it gave Name in elder Times to a Family &s;o &s;tyled; for in an old Deed without Date, in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Whit|tingham-Wood</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> lately decea&s;ed, I find <HI>Richard de Siber&s;ton</HI> demi&s;es it to <HI>John Monins,</HI> and in another Deed I di&s;cover that <HI>John Monins</HI> Son of <HI>John Mo|nins,</HI> pa&s;&s;es the third Part of his Mannor of <HI>Siber&s;ton</HI> to <HI>John Monins</HI> the elder, in the thirty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. And this I think is Authority &s;uffici|ent to evidence to the Publique, that it was a parcel of that E&s;tate that owned the Intere&s;t and Signory of that eminent Family, in which it lay couched until the lat|ter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was by Sale tran&s;planted into <HI>Pepper,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or in our Fathers Remembrance conveyed it to <HI>Moulton</HI> of <HI>Retherhed,</HI> vulgar|ly called <HI>Redriff</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> in who&s;e De&s;cendants the Inheritance of it does &s;till continue.</P>
<P><HI>Hunton</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Twiford,</HI> celebrates the Memory of an ancient Family, called <HI>Lenham,</HI> who were once Proprietaries of it. <HI>Nicolas de Lenham</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannour of <HI>Hunton,</HI> in the forty fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third; but about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the Intere&s;t of it was departed from this Family, for <HI>William de Lenham</HI> determined in <HI>Eleanor de Lenham,</HI> his &s;ole Inheritrix, and &s;he by matching with <HI>John Gifford,</HI> wrapt up this and <HI>Ben|&s;ted,</HI> another little Mannor in this Pari&s;h, which likewi&s;e was parcel of <HI>Lenhams</HI> E&s;tate, in the Demea&s;ne of that Family; and he and his Wife paid Releif for <HI>Hunton</HI> and <HI>Ben&s;ted,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, at making the Black Prince Knight. But after this, it was not long permanent in this Family; for about the Beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, it was pa&s;&s;ed away with <HI>Ben&s;ted</HI> to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> who in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was found Heir to his Cozen <HI>William Clinton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Huntington;</HI> for that Land which he held <HI>Jure proprio &amp; nativo,</HI> not <HI>Jure uxoris Julianae de Leybourne</HI> in this County. And the Effi|gies of this <HI>John,</HI> and of his Grand child ...... Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> (who paid Relief, in the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, for his Mannor of <HI>Hunton,</HI> at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Prince's Daughter) have e&s;caped the furious Barbarity of the&s;e Times, and &s;tand yet undemoli&s;hed in the Church-Windows: and from this la&s;t did it de&s;cend to <HI>John</HI> Lord <HI>Clinton</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, who about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh alienated the Fee-&s;imple to Sir <HI>Henry Wiatt,</HI> one of the Privy Councel to the &s;aid Monarch, and his Son Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt</HI> the elder died &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and tran&s;mitted it with <HI>Ben&s;ted,</HI> which his Grand-father likewi&s;e bought of the Lord <HI>Clinton,</HI> to his infortunate Son Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> who adhering too &s;trictly to an unhappy Clau&s;e in the Te&s;tament of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which obliges his Councel not to &s;uffer his Daughters to e&s;pou&s;e any Forrainer, involved him in that dy&s;a&s;trous De&s;ign, which could not be expiated, but by the Forfeiture of his Life and E&s;tate, in which this Mannor of <HI>Hunton</HI> being concerned; it was in the &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Mary</HI> granted to her Atturney General, Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Si&s;inghur&s;t,</HI> from whom the Title in the Stream of Succe&s;&s;ion, lately glided down to his Heir General Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, Son

<P><HI>Bur&s;ton</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>Hunton,</HI> which is eminent for being the Seat of <HI>John de Bur&s;ton,</HI> which the Datele&s;s Deeds that relate to this Family, from the pro|bable Conjecture of the Hand-writing, which is calculated for the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, record to have lived in that Prince's Time, and there was Land like|wi&s;e about <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Crundall,</HI> that acknowledged the Juri&s;diction of this Family; for in the forty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Waretius de Valoigns</HI> Knight, makes a Relea&s;e of his Title to &s;ome Lands in tho&s;e Pari&s;hes to <HI>John de Bur&s;ton,</HI> and in this Family did this Seat remain for many De&s;cents, and was productive of men of no de&s;picable Account in this Track: among&s;t whom <HI>William Bur&s;ton</HI> was returned, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, by <HI>Gervas Clifton</HI> then Sheriff, <HI>inter illos qui portabant Arma Antiqua.</HI> In the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, Alderman <HI>Head</HI> of <HI>London</HI> was re&s;ident here, and added much both of Building and Magnifi|cence to this Fabrick; but certainly it was only as Le&s;&s;ee; for I cannot find that he was ever Proprietary of it, for about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it was &s;old by <HI>Bur&s;ton</HI> to Sir <HI>Thomas Vane,</HI> who upon his Decea&s;e gave it to his &s;econd Son ...... <HI>Vane,</HI> from whom it de&s;cended to his Heir Sir <HI>George Vane,</HI> who&s;e Widdow Dowager the Lady ...... <HI>Vane</HI> is now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hunton</HI> had the Grant of a Market procured to it by <HI>Nicolas de Lenham,</HI> on the Tue&s;day, and a yearly Fair to continue five Dayes, the Vigil, the Day of the A&s;&s;umption of our Lady, and three Dayes after, <HI>Pat.</HI> 41. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 7.</P>

<P>Yet there is an ancient Seat in this Pari&s;h, called <HI>Rump&s;ted,</HI> which never was couched in the Spiritual Patrimony; for it had anciently Owners of that Appella|tion.

<P><HI>ICkham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Downehamford,</HI> was given by King <HI>Offa</HI> to <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> and to the Monks of that Covent, in the year 781. under the Notion of fifteen Plough-lands, and was for a Supplement of Dyet. This Donation in the year 958. was confirmed by <HI>Athelward, Odo</HI> the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> being then pre&s;ent, and atte&s;ting the Ratification: In the Time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, when the fir&s;t De&s;ign of Doome&s;day Book was &s;tarted; it was rated at four Sullings or Plough-lands: nor did it fall in that Account, when that generall Regi&s;ter was perfected, which was in the twentieth year of the Conqueror, defending it &s;elf at the &s;ame E&s;timate, and upon the Apprai&s;ment was valued at thirty pound.

<P><HI>Cheyneys Court</HI> is a &s;econd place of Account in this Pari&s;h, and had this Name impo&s;ed upon it, becau&s;e it lay folded up in the Revenue of that Name, of that Family, <HI>Alexander de Cheyney,</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, in the ninth of which Prince's raign he was one of that Catalogue, as appears by <HI>Kirkbie</HI>'s Inque&s;t kept in the Exchequer, who was em|barked in that &s;ucce&s;&s;efull War, which was commenced by that Monarch again&s;t the <HI>Wel&s;h,</HI> and dyed po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Mannor, in the twenty fourth year of his Government.

<P><HI>Bibrooke</HI> is a &s;econd Place in <HI>Kenington,</HI> which claims &s;ome Con&s;ideration.

Of what Capacity it was, is not now exactly to be di&s;cer|ned, much of it being overgrown with a Thicket: but very va&s;t it was, as may be collected, from its remains, which are yet apparent. And mo&s;t probable, it is that Camp which <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> pitched, when the Britons, with their united &s;trength, gave him the la&s;t Battle; and then the &s;ucce&s;&s;e, being not equall to their Cou|rage, retired, and gave him way to pierce into <HI>Surrey,</HI> and &s;o towards the <HI>Thames</HI> by <HI>Noviomagum,</HI> or <HI>Woodcott,</HI> where he planted a &s;patious City and &s;tanding Camp.</P>

<P><HI>Ilding</HI> in <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> in Times of as high a Step as any Records can a&s;cend to, was the <HI>Garwintons</HI> of <HI>Bekesbourn,</HI> as appears by that Signal Controver&s;ie, com|menced between <HI>Thomas de Garwintor,</HI> and <HI>Theobald de Twitham,</HI> touching &s;ome lands couched within the Verge of his Mannor of <HI>Ilding:</HI> and the Que&s;tion was &s;o knotty and perplexed, that <HI>Henry de Cobham, Geffrey de Say, Hugh de St. Leger, Ralph de St. Leger, Gile; de Badele&s;mere, Fulk de Peyferer, Robert de Malevill, Alex|ander de Ro&s;&s;e, Robert de Gatton, Robert de Campania, Richard de Bere, Henry de Sorne, Henry de Enbroke, Alured de Corton;</HI> and other Gentlemen of prime Account in this Track, were cho&s;en <HI>Recegnitores magnae A&s;&s;i&s;ae,</HI> in the &s;econd year of King <HI>John,</HI> by their Prudence and dextrous Conduct, to &s;often and becalme this Diffe|rence.

<P><HI>Parme&s;ted</HI> is a third place which calls for a Survey: it was as high, as any Evidence drawn from Record will in&s;truct me to di&s;cover, the Inheritance of a Family which bore that Sirname: for in diver&s;e old Deeds which I have &s;urveyed, I find one <HI>Hugh de Perme&s;ted</HI> to be a Witne&s;&s;e, which is very probable, was Lord of this Place.

He, to revenge this Deva&s;tation of his Ca&s;tle, a&s;&s;ociates with the Barons, then in Arms, who pretended the Common good and publick Liberty of the People (they being &s;till that unhappy Ve&s;&s;el which every Tempe&s;t &s;hipwracks, but no Calm &s;ecures: Or, indeed, being like the Sea, which never &s;wells into Di&s;order, untill it be breath'd upon by intemperate Winds; and yet even tho&s;e very Winds break to pieces tho&s;e waters which they fir&s;t rai&s;ed into Billows and Surges.) But, to go on; This De&s;ign (whether the Foundation, on which it was fixt, were crazy and infirme or not, I know not) was Ruinous to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badele&s;mer,</HI> and the Barons his Parti&s;ans; for they were defeared by the Forces of King <HI>Edward,</HI> and among&s;t the re&s;t this Lord, and the Lord <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> being by their misfortune made pri&s;oners, were put to Death at <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Shipwrack, this Ca&s;tle reverts to the Crown; and Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Arundell</HI> having a mind equivalent to his Birth, gets &s;uch a Grant of this Ca&s;tle, as in many Acts of his, he dates them, At his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Leeds:</HI> and you may ob&s;erve that this would not &s;erve the turn neither, for he was at the &s;ame time Con&s;table of the late before builded Ca&s;tle of <HI>Quinborough.</HI> But the E&s;tate he had in it determined with him, and then it remained in the Crown, and was reputed one of the Kings Hou&s;es, and the Cu&s;tody was conferred upon &s;ome of the principal Gentlemen of <HI>Kent,</HI> whom the King <HI>pro tempore</HI> favoured.

<P>Sixthly, <HI>Sheals</HI> is not to be forgotten, becau&s;e it was the Inheritance of <HI>Fremingham,</HI> for <HI>Ralph de Fremingham</HI> died &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and when this Family went out, the <HI>Pimps</HI> of <HI>Pimps-Court</HI> and <HI>Nettle&s;ted,</HI> by Purcha&s;e became Lords of the Fee; from whom the &s;ame Fare brought it to acknowledge the Signory of the <HI>I&s;leys</HI> of <HI>Sundrich;</HI> and here it continued, till Sir <HI>Henry I&s;ley</HI> in the Raign of Q. <HI>Mary,</HI> being attainted of High Trea&s;on, it became Confi&s;cated to the Crown, and She in the &s;econd year of her Government, granted it to Sir <HI>Walter Henley</HI> Knight, of <HI>Cour&s;ehorne</HI> in <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> in who&s;e Name and po&s;ierity the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has remained Succe&s;&s;ively planted till this Day.</P>
<P>Seventhly, <HI>Chillington</HI> is not to be omitted, becau&s;e I find it in the Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e Lands which acknowledged the Lords <HI>Cobham,</HI> for Lords of the Fee: And when <HI>John de Cobham</HI> had obtained a Charter of Free-warren, in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, to all his Lands in <HI>Kent,</HI> The Mannor of <HI>Chillington</HI> is Recorded in the Catalogue among&s;t them. After them, it came (as the Court-rolls and private Evi|dences of this place inform me) to acknowledge the Signory and Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Mapely&s;dens</HI> of <HI>Digons,</HI> and remained circum&s;cribed in their Revenue, till Queen <HI>Mary</HI> began to weild the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Scepter, and then <HI>George Mapely&s;den</HI> being entangled beyond all retreat, in the un&s;ucce&s;&s;full Expedition of Sir <HI>Thomas Wyat,</HI> mi&s;carried in that Attempt, and lo&s;t his E&s;tate by Forfeiture to the Crown, and Q. <HI>Mary</HI> granted it to Sir <HI>Walter,</HI> and <HI>Gervas Henley</HI> E&s;quire, who not long after &s;old his
<PB N="230" REF="123">Intere&s;t in it to <HI>Nicholas Barham</HI> E&s;quire, Serjeant at Law to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;or alienated this place to <HI>Hawle</HI> of <HI>Wye,</HI> who&s;e Grandchild Mr. <HI>George Hawle</HI> lately decea&s;ed, held the Fee-&s;imple of it.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, within the Ambute or Limits of <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> &s;tands an ancient Ca&s;tellated Hou&s;e called the Moate. It did in times of great Antiquity, relate to that Patrimo|ny which confe&s;&s;ed the Signory of the noted Family of <HI>Leybourne:</HI> for <HI>Roger de Ley|bourne</HI> obtained the Grant of a Market weekly on the <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and a Fair yearly to continue three Dayes at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> in the fifty fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 51. <HI>Hen. tertii Memb.</HI> 10. But before the beginning of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, this Name was withered and &s;hrunk into Decay at this place, and then <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burghur&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Burwa&s;h,</HI> Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, and one of the fir&s;t Founders of the Order of the Garter, came to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it, and Inhabited here in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Signory called <HI>Shofford,</HI> on which the Ca&s;tle &s;tands, and which one <HI>John de Shofford</HI> held by Knights-Service, in the twentieth year (as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI>) of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After the Lords <HI>Burghur&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Woodvills</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, and removed from <HI>Grafton</HI> in the County of <HI>North-Hampton,</HI> where they had long continued, and lived here. A fair Monument of <HI>Woodvill,</HI> on the <HI>North</HI>-&s;ide the Chancell of <HI>Maid&s;tone</HI>-Church affirms it: and when King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth created <HI>Richard Woodvill</HI> Con&s;table of the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> a Baron of this Nation, and elected him into the Order of the Garter, his Style was, Lord <HI>Rivers, Grafton,</HI> and <HI>De la Moat;</HI> which Act of Grace and Favour, mollifi|ed a Sentence and Fine of 1000. <ABBR>lb.</ABBR> impo&s;ed upon him, for matching with <HI>Jaquet,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Luxenbourg,</HI> Earl of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> Widow of <HI>John Plantagente</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> without the Kings Licence. But when King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, had mar|ried <HI>Elizabeth</HI> his elde&s;t Daughter, being widow to <HI>Thomas</HI> Marque&s;&s;e <HI>Dorcett,</HI> he cre|ated him Earl <HI>Rivers,</HI> and Lord of the I&s;le of <HI>VVight,</HI> which Titles he had ob&s;erved were concomitant in &s;ome of the Styles of the Lords <HI>Rivers,</HI> or <HI>de Ripariis,</HI> who were the Ancient Earls of <HI>Devon,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed to bear in an E&s;cocheon of pretence upon his own Atchievement, the old Coat a&s;cribed commonly to <HI>Baldwin de Ripariis</HI> Earl of <HI>Devon, viz. Gules a Griphen Segreant Or:</HI> which I note for Criticks in Armorie to de&s;cant on, and return to the Hi&s;torie of the Place. When this good man, for &s;o he was noted to be, was mi&s;erably ma&s;&s;acred by <HI>Robert Ridi&s;dale</HI> Captain of the Lewd People of <HI>North-Hampton</HI>-&s;hire, who took him at <HI>Edgcot-Field,</HI> and &s;truck off his head at <HI>North-Hampton</HI> (Their Will being their Law, and Mi&s;chief Mini&s;ter to their wild De&s;igns?) all his &s;even Sons who &s;urvived him, died without I&s;&s;ue, and then Sir <HI>Henry VVyat</HI> becomes owner of this place, Grandfather to Sir <HI>Thomas VViat,</HI> afterwards his Succe&s;&s;or in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, who&s;e dy&s;a&s;trous Tragedy is pre&s;ented at <HI>Boxley,</HI> upon who&s;e untimely <HI>Exit, Hugh VVarham</HI> in the &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by Grant from the Crown, enters upon it, from whom Alderman <HI>Rither</HI> afterwards Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and known by the Name of Sir <HI>VVilliam Rither,</HI> Purcha&s;ed and Repaired it and left it to his Daughter and Coheir, the Lady <HI>Su&s;an Cae&s;ar,</HI> who&s;e elde&s;t Son <HI>Tho.

<P>There was a Family Sirnamed <HI>de Maid&s;tone,</HI> who&s;e Blazon upon a Monument in <HI>&V;lcombe</HI> Church is, <HI>Sables a Cheveron between three Cups, covered, Argent Crowned Or, VVilliam de Maid&s;ton</HI> the Kings Valect, being &s;ent to the Court of <HI>Rome</HI> with certain In&s;truments, and other expre&s;&s;es, deceas'd in his Journey, as appears <HI>Pat.

<P><HI>Pinenden-Heath</HI> confines upon <HI>Maid&s;ton,</HI> and is eminent for the Puni&s;hment of Ma|lefactors, and the frequent A&s;&s;emblies of Free-holders, who here convene to elect &s;uch Per&s;ons for Knights of the Shire, as may repre&s;ent the County in Parliament. But it was in elder times more famous for that great Convention of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> who met there in the fourth year of <HI>Wil.</HI> the Conquerour, to decide the great Controver&s;ie which then broke forth, between <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and <HI>Odo</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> touching &s;ome Lands and Priviledges which the &s;aid Arch-Bi&s;hop alleaged were by an unju&s;t U&s;urpation by the above-&s;aid <HI>Odo</HI> ravi&s;hed away from the Church: which be|cau&s;e it gives us a full Pro&s;pect of that exorbitant and wide power which the Clergie of
<PB N="231" REF="123">tho&s;e times did entitle them&s;elves to. I &s;hall endevour to pourtray it in as Brief and narrow a Landskip, as I have pencill'd it out by <HI>Textus Roffen&s;is,</HI> an old Book in Manu&s;cript &s;o called, where it is more voluminou&s;ly repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>At <HI>Pinenden-Heath</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Textus Roffen&s;is</HI>) in the fourth year of <HI>William</HI> the Con|querour, there was an A&s;&s;emblie of the grave&s;t and di&s;creete&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> by a &s;ignall Deci&s;ion and Debate, to deternine of that Controver&s;ie, which did formerly ari&s;e between <HI>Odo</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bayeux,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> touching &s;ome Lands and Priveledges which were detained from the Church by the &s;aid Earl; and <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The &s;aid Di&s;pute or Debate la&s;ted three Dayes: after the expiration of which, the &s;aid Arch-Bi&s;hop recovered &s;everall Lands which he the &s;aid <HI>Odo</HI> and his Tenants then held, which were <HI>Herbert</HI> the Son of <HI>Ivo, Turold</HI> of <HI>Roche&s;ter, Ralph de Curva-Spina,</HI> and <HI>Hugh de Montfort,</HI> with all the Franchi&s;es belonging to them, as namely, <HI>Sac</HI> and <HI>Soc, Toll</HI> and <HI>Theam, Infangtheof</HI> and <HI>Outfang|theof, Flymena, Firmth, Grithbreach, Fore&s;tall, Heinfare,</HI> and <HI>Cer&s;ett;</HI> (the la&s;t of which, becau&s;e none of our Interpreters of the dark and ob&s;cure Terms of the Law do ex|plain, I &s;hall; It was a Rent-charge of a certain Proportion of Corn in the ear, paid at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Martin,</HI>) with all other Cu&s;tomes greater or le&s;s, both on the Land and on the Water; and it was tried and proved by all the hone&s;t and wi&s;e Men both <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who were pre&s;ent, that as the King him&s;elf, holds his Lands quiet, and free in his Demea&s;ne, &s;o the Arch-Bi&s;hop holds all his Lands whoily quiet and free in his Demea&s;ne. In the pre&s;ence of the&s;e, it was &s;hewn by many and mo&s;t evident Rea&s;ons, that the King hath no Cu&s;tomes in the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> but onely three, which are the&s;e. If any man digg in the Kings High-way, or cut down any Tree to &s;top it, if any man &s;hall be apprehended and found Culpable, while&s;t they are in doing &s;uch things, whether Pledges be taken of them or not, yet by pro&s;e|cution of the Kings Officer, and by Pledges they &s;hall amend what is unju&s;tly done. The third Cu&s;tome is, If any man commit Blood-&s;hed on the Kings High-way; if whil&s;t he does it he be apprehended and impri&s;oned, he &s;hall then make amends unto the King: But if he &s;hall not be apprehended, but depart without giving any Pledge, the King may not in Ju&s;tice require any thing of him. And it was at the &s;ame time farther determined, that if any Per&s;on did commit Blood-&s;hed, or Man&s;laughter, in places which were within the Liberties of the Church of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> from the time that the Church left off to Sing <HI>Alleluiah,</HI> to the Octaves of <HI>Ea&s;ter;</HI> that then he &s;hould make amends onely to the Arch-Bi&s;hop. And it was likewi&s;e &s;hewed at the &s;ame Time, that who&s;oever &s;hould commit the Crime of Childwitt, that is, of Ba|&s;tardy; if it were in Lent, the Arch-Bi&s;hop &s;hould have the whole Satisfaction; but if out of Lent, then he &s;hould have onely half of it.</P>
<P>There were pre&s;ent at this A&s;&s;embly, <HI>Goisfrid</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> the Kings Sub|&s;titute, <HI>Erno&s;t</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter, Egelric</HI> or <HI>Agelric</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sel&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Chi|che&s;ter,</HI> a Man of deep in&s;ight in the Con&s;titutions Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and of &s;o great an Age, that he was brought in a Wagon, for his Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and Declaration, (&s;ays <HI>Textus Roffen&s;is</HI>) upon the known Laws, U&s;ages, Franchi&s;es, and Cu&s;tomes of Holy Church. <HI>Hugh de Montfort, William de Arces, Richard de Tunbridge;</HI> and la&s;tly, <HI>Haymo.</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Town Malling</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t Malling</HI> lie in the Hundred of <HI>Larkfield,</HI> and were both Mannors which related to that Revenue, which made up the Patrimony of the Nunnery of <HI>Town Malling,</HI> which was founded by <HI>Gundulphus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ro|che&s;ter,</HI> about the year 1090, and dedicated to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and had the Church it &s;elf which was likewi&s;e named after the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, and the Chappel of St. <HI>Leonards</HI> not far di&s;tant. Though this <HI>Gundulphus</HI> was the Founder, yet <HI>Haimo de Heath,</HI> as appears by the Records of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> aws an eminent Benefactor to it about the year 1339. Both the&s;e Mannors upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion having aug|mented the Revenue of the Crown, they re&s;ted there, untill the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, and then they were granted in Lea&s;e for Life, to Sir <HI>Hugh Cartwright,</HI> and upon his Decea&s;e, they were pa&s;&s;ed away upon the &s;ame Condi|tion to <HI>Pierpoint;</HI> and he conveyed them to <HI>William Brook</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham;</HI> who&s;e Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> being attainted in the &s;econd year of King <HI>James,</HI> they were

Antiquity has &s;et a noble Attribute upon it, for in ancient Records it is &s;tyled <HI>Regia Villa de Middleton,</HI> and here at <HI>Kem&s;ley</HI> Downe, derived from <HI>Camp&s;ley, viz.</HI> the pa&s;tures where the Camp was kept. Within the Pari&s;h of <HI>Mid|dleton,</HI> is the very place, where, in the Time of King <HI>Alfred, Ha&s;ten</HI> the Dane, that &s;o much infe&s;ted <HI>France,</HI> arrived, and fortified in &s;uch manner as he before had at <HI>Apuldore,</HI> where he erected a Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Fragments and Reliques are yet vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>Our ancient Chroniclers inform us, that this Town, was in a good Condition till the Ragin of <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or: in who&s;e days, during the Di&s;gu&s;t be|tween him and Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> &s;uch as confederated with the Earl at home, burnt the King's Hou&s;e here at <HI>Middleton,</HI> a ca&s;tellated Pallace beneath the Church, whil&s;t he and his Sons ran&s;ack'd and ruin'd many other places upon the Seacoa&s;ts, and Skirts of the Shire.</P>
<P>In Times of a latter Date <HI>John de Burgo,</HI> the elder, had a Grant by Patent of the Mannors of <HI>Middleton,</HI> and <HI>Marden,</HI> in the &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t: and after <HI>Margaret</HI> Queen of <HI>England,</HI> had a Grant by Patent likewi&s;e in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd; and after her, Queen <HI>Philippa</HI> Wife to <HI>Edward</HI> the third, had probably this Mannor in Dower, for in the nineteenth year of that King's Raign, as appears <HI>Pat.

<P>There is within the Limitts of this Pari&s;h, a Mannor called <HI>Northwood Cha&s;te|ners,</HI> which Name complies with the &s;ituation, for it &s;tands North from the Town in a Wood, where Che&s;t-Nut Trees formerly grew abundantly. <HI>Stephen</HI> the Son of <HI>Jordan de Shepey,</HI> de&s;irous to plant him&s;elf out of the I&s;land, in &s;ome place not far di&s;tant; built here a Man&s;ion-hou&s;e, moated about,

<P>Then we have here &s;econdly another place, which in &s;ome old Evidences, is repre&s;ented under the Name of <HI>Nottingham</HI> Court, though now it bears the Name of <HI>Higham.</HI> It was the Re&s;idence of a noble Family called <HI>Nottingham,</HI> who were Owners of a large Patrimony in this Track, and their Armes &s;tand yet in old coloured Gla&s;&s;e in <HI>Mil&s;ted</HI> Church, <HI>viz.

It was in the year 1019, as an ancient Court-roll, now in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Chapman</HI> does inform me, in the Hands of <HI>John de Fleming,</HI> and probably, here it remained diver&s;e years, though I can di&s;cover nothing, which may evince the certainty of it; for there is an Intermi&s;|&s;ion or Gap in the Evidences.

<P><HI>Newenden</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Selbrittenden,</HI> was erected in the place where the old Roman City of <HI>Anderida</HI> was &s;ituated, and was called by the Britons <HI>Caer Andred,</HI> very aptly by <HI>Leland,</HI> &s;tyled in Latine, <HI>Noviodunum,</HI> from the Saxon, <HI>Nywandun,</HI> in Engli&s;h by Corruption called <HI>Newenden,</HI> which in the original imports as much as The new Hill in the Valley.</P>
<P>This was that Station and City of the Romans mentioned in the Banner of the Count, or Lord Warden of the Saxon Shore, by <HI>Pancerollus</HI> in his Book called <HI>Notitia Provinciarum,</HI> under the Name of <HI>Anderida,</HI> and &s;ometimes written <HI>An|deridos;</HI> and here was the Ca&s;tle which the Saxons called <HI>Andreds Cea&s;ter;</HI> and the great Wood, which &s;tretched out in length, from hence into <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> 80. miles was named <HI>Andreds-wald,</HI> and by the Britons <HI>Coid Andred,</HI> other rea&s;ons are laid down for the Identity of the place, extracted from the Name which the Engli&s;h Saxons gave it, who termed it <HI>Brittenden,</HI> that is, The Britons Vale, from whence the whole Hundred adjoyning is called <HI>Sellbrittenden,</HI> that is, The Britons Woody Vale.</P>

But &s;oon after the Romans de&s;erted <HI>Brittain,</HI> it &s;hrunk into Decay, being ruined by the Engli&s;h Saxons; and yet a marke of the Lo&s;&s;e, is covertly couched, under the Name of the principal Mannor, called <HI>Lo&s;enham,</HI> of which &s;omething is to be remembred, when we have done with the Hi&s;tory of this place, which I have thus abbreviated. <HI>Hengi&s;t,</HI> be|ing fully determined to expell all the Britons out of <HI>Kent,</HI> and thinking it would much conduce to the improvement of his De&s;ign, to recruite his Army with Troops of his own Nation, called <HI>Ella</HI> the Founder of the South-Saxon Kingdome, and his three Sons with a &s;trong Power out of <HI>Germanie,</HI> and then gave a &s;harp A&s;&s;ault again&s;t this <HI>Anderida,</HI> but was intercepted at that in&s;tant in his De&s;igne, by tho&s;e vigorous Impre&s;&s;ions, which the Britons out of their Ambu&s;hments in the Woods then made upon him. In Fine, after many Prejudices and Lo&s;&s;es both given and taken: <HI>Hen|gi&s;t</HI> divided his Army, and not onely di&s;comfited the Britons in the adjacent wood but al&s;o at the &s;ame Time, forced the City by A&s;&s;ault, and became &s;o enflamed with revenge, that nothing but the Extinction of the Inhabitants, by a publick &s;laughter, and the totall demoli&s;hing of the Town, could &s;uper&s;ede or allay &s;o great an Animo&s;ity. The place lying thus de&s;olate, was &s;hewed (as <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Hunting|don</HI> reports) many Ages after, to inqui&s;itive Pa&s;&s;engers, till in the year 791, King <HI>Offa</HI> gave this and other Lands to the Arch-bi&s;hop and Monks of <HI>Canterbury, ad Pa&s;cua Porcorum,</HI> for the Pannage of their Hoggs.</P>

Divers of the Nuns being warped with a malitious De&s;ire of Revenge, took the advantage of the Night, and &s;trangled the Lady <HI>Abbe&s;&s;e,</HI> who was the Object of their Fury, and pa&s;&s;ionate Animo&s;ities, in her Bed; and after, to conceal &s;o execrable an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, threw her Body into a Pitt, which afterwards contracted the traditional Appellati|on of <HI>Nun-pitt;</HI> but this barbarous offence being not long after miraculou&s;ly di&s;|covered (the Manu&s;cript does not intimate how;) King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in who&s;e Time this Tragedy was acted, &s;ei&s;ed this Mannor into his Hands, and having by Con&s;ent of the Church tran&s;mitted the Nuns, who were culpable, to the &s;ecular power, by Death to make expiation for this Crime; he &s;ent the Guiltle&s;s Nuns into <HI>Shepey,</HI> and after filled their Cloi&s;ter with &s;even &s;ecular Canons: four of which not long after (as if &s;ome &s;ecret Impiety had lurked in the Wals of the Covent) murdered one of the Fraternity; upon which the King &s;ei&s;es this Mannor a|gain into his Hands, which he had before given back to the &s;upport of this new in&s;tituted Seminary: two parts of which laying in the Hamlet of <HI>Thetham</HI> by the two guiltle&s;&s;e Canons, with the approbation of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, were a&s;&s;igned to the Abby of St. <HI>Augu&s;tins</HI> (though &s;ome Writings more Ancient affirm them to be given under the Notion of two Prebendaries to that Covent) by <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror; and the other five parts of this Mannor, were by the above&s;aid <HI>Henry</HI> the third, granted to his Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, Sir <HI>Richard de Lucy,</HI> who&s;e Son <HI>Almericus de Lucy,</HI> &s;aies the Manu&s;cript, did in the year 1278. exchange them with the Monks of St. <HI>Augu&s;tins.</HI> And thus was this Mannor fa&s;tned to the Patrimony of the Church, and &s;o continued, till the General Di&s;&s;olution in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth di&s;|united it, and linked it afterwards to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown, in who&s;e De|mea&s;ne till the Death of the late King <HI>Charles,</HI> it lay, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, involved.</P>
<P>At this Pari&s;h of <HI>Newington,</HI> not long &s;ince were digged up many <HI>Roman</HI> Urns, not far di&s;tant from the high way or common pa&s;&s;age, it being agreeable unto <HI>Ro|man</HI> practice to interre in tho&s;e places, where their Monuments might be obvious almo&s;t to every Eye, Memorials of them&s;elves, and Memento's of Mortality un|to living Pa&s;&s;engers, whom the Epitaphs of great ones were fain to beg to &s;tay and look upon them. Some of the&s;e were of a larger, and &s;ome again of a nar|rower Capacity, it being Cu&s;tomary among&s;t the <HI>Romans,</HI> for the Servants and Clients to obtain Repo&s;itories for their Remains in Urns of a le&s;&s;er; for the Ma&s;ters and Patrons to &s;lumber in Urns of a more wide and &s;patious Dimen&s;ion: and many were &s;o curious, that they contrived va&s;t Family-Urns to continue their living Re|lations, wherein the A&s;hes of their neare&s;t Kindred and Friends, at lea&s;t &s;ome par|cels of them might, as in &s;ome common Exchequer, be trea&s;ured up, that &s;o the Union in Life might be multiplyed and inforced by an amicable Corre&s;pondence, even in the place of Sepulture; thus the A&s;hes of <HI>Domitian</HI> were mingled with tho&s;e of <HI>Julia,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Achilles</HI> &s;lept in the &s;ame Urn with tho&s;e of his <HI>Patroclus.</HI> That this U&s;age or Practice of the <HI>Romans</HI> extracted its pedigree from <HI>Greece</HI> is ma|nife&s;t: For all Authors that have taken a Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Graecian</HI> Rites of Funerals, con&s;ent that tho&s;e of <HI>Megara</HI> &s;hut up the Bones of four or five Per&s;ons in the narrow Confines of one Repertory, or Sepulchral-Urn.

In the&s;e <HI>Newington</HI> Urns, as my Intelligence in&s;tructs me, there were traced out many peeces of <HI>Roman</HI> Coin, it being Cu&s;tomary among&s;t that Nation, not only to inclo&s;e Coin or Mony, both of Con&s;ulary and Imperial Stamp, by which the Date of their Friends Decea&s;e, might be hinted to an Intelligent Ob&s;ervation; but like|wi&s;e Fragments of tho&s;e Things the Decea&s;ed in his Life Time did particularly af|fect, as namely, Spear Heads, peeces of Darts and Swords, broken Armor, the Ca&s;&s;is or Helmet, Shields, Goblets, Berill Rings, be&s;ides a great Number of Gems, with Heads of Gods and Godde&s;&s;es, and the pourtraiture of &s;everal Crea|tures, fa&s;hioned out of Agat and Amber. Now if any will inquire of me, When this Cu&s;tome of burning the Dead, and after depo&s;iting their Du&s;t in Sepulchral Urns, became to be in U&s;e among&s;t the <HI>Romans?</HI> I confe&s;s I am &s;atisfied the Time is incertain, though I dare po&s;itively aver, it was originally tran&s;ported from <HI>Greece,</HI> where it was u&s;ed though with more formality, long before it was adopted into the U&s;ages of this Nation. For fir&s;t the <HI>Graecians</HI> burned only the Bodies of tho&s;e of more eminent Account, but denied it to tho&s;e who were of ba&s;er Allay, or of ob|&s;curer Fame; as likewi&s;e they did to decea&s;ed Infants; to tho&s;e who were bla&s;ted or de&s;troyed with Lightning, becau&s;e they &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly conceived them enemies to the Powers above; to tho&s;e who had impiou&s;ly laid violent hands upon them|&s;elves; and la&s;tly, to tho&s;e who had by a perfidious Apo&s;ta&s;ie, declared them&s;elves to be De&s;ertors and Betrayers of their Country. Secondly, they burned only the fle&s;h of the Body, re&s;erving the Bones to be laid up in Che&s;ts or Repertories, which they called <HI>Thecae,</HI> which among&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> had the Title of <HI>O&s;&s;uaria,</HI> be&s;towed on them. Thirdly, they e&s;teemed it &s;o great an Honor for any per&s;on to &s;leep in his owne Native Countrey, that if he decea&s;ed in any Forrain Region, which was in Amity with them, they there, after their Cu&s;tomary Manner burned his Body, and with much Solemnity tran&s;ported his Reliques to the place of his Nativity, and at every Cro&s;&s;e Way had their appointed Fea&s;ts, which were made at the Expence of the Re|lations and Friends of the Defunct, which they called their <HI>Compitalia.</HI> La&s;tly, they &s;trewed Flowers on the Urns and Repo&s;itories of the Dead, and adorned them with Ribands, as they did the Urn of <HI>Philopaemen;</HI> but they more particularly affe|cted the &s;trewing of Myrtle, and Amaranthus, on the A&s;hes of their departed Rela|tions, as the <HI>Romans</HI> did that of the Ro&s;e; yet both of them did concur in the Com|po&s;ition of the Funeral Pile, which was furni&s;hed and made up of Ro&s;emary, La|ryx, Yew, Cypre&s;&s;e, and Firre, wherein it is probable were couched &s;ome tacit Hints of their &s;urviving Hopes; and in which my&s;terious Hieroglyphicks, as being Trees which were perpetually verdant, were wrapped up &s;ome &s;ecret Inferences of a future Re&s;urrection. That this Cu&s;tome of Burning the Dead did afterwards by an univer&s;al Imitation extend and &s;pread it &s;elf to other Nations. That the <HI>Druids</HI> and
<PB N="251" REF="133">ruling Prie&s;ts were accu&s;tomed to burn their Dead is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Pomponius:</HI> That they held that practi&s;e in <HI>Gaule, Cae&s;ar</HI> expre&s;ly delivers: That burning the Dead was u&s;ed in <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> is affirmed by <HI>Gaguinus:</HI> That the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Gothlanders</HI> did frequently commit their Princes and more eminent Per&s;ons to the Fire, is de|livered by <HI>Saxo</HI> and <HI>Olaus:</HI> That this was the old <HI>German</HI> practi&s;e, is al&s;o a&s;&s;erted by <HI>Tacitus.</HI> And that it was cu&s;tomary among&s;t the <HI>Danes,</HI> Several Urns, di&s;covered in <HI>Jutland</HI> and <HI>Sle&s;wick</HI> not many years &s;ince, do ea&s;ily evince, which contained not only Bones, but many other Sub&s;tances in them, as Knives, peeces of Iron, Bra&s;s and Wood, and one of <HI>Norway</HI> a Bra&s;s guilded Jews-harp. When this Cu&s;tome of Burning of the Dead langui&s;hed into Di&s;u&s;e, is incertain; but that it began to va|ni&s;h, upon the Dawning of Chri&s;tianity, as Vapors and Mi&s;ts &s;catter before a Morn|ing Sun, is without Controver&s;ie; but when the Light of it did more vigorou&s;ly reflect, like a <HI>Meridian</HI> Beam, on all the gloomy Corners and Rece&s;&s;es of Paga|ni&s;m and Infidelity; then this U&s;e of Urn-Burial, was wholly &s;uper&s;eded, and found a Tomb it &s;elf in the more &s;ober and &s;everer practi&s;e of Chri&s;tianity. And thus much &s;hall be &s;aid concerning the&s;e Urns digged up at <HI>Newington.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Nockholt</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Ruxley,</HI> was a Branch which was incorporated into the Revenue of the Lord <HI>Say.

<P><HI>OFham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Larkefeild,</HI> was Anciently divided between two Families <HI>Corton</HI> and <HI>Ditton: Richard de Corton</HI> held half a Knights Fee at this place, and paid re&s;pective Aide for it at making the Black Prince Knight, as ap|pears by the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Aide,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Ralph de Ditton</HI> paid an auxiliary Contribution for the other Moity, which likewi&s;e was held by half a Knights Fee, at the Inve&s;titure above-&s;aid; but long it continued not to confe&s;s the Signory of the&s;e two Families: for <HI>Codwell</HI> which was part of the Man|nor of <HI>Offham,</HI> was alienated by <HI>Richard de Corton</HI> to <HI>Thomas de Godchepe,</HI> and he was in the enjoyment of it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the one and thirtieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Godchepe</HI> had de&s;erted the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I find by &s;ome old Conrt-rols, that commence from the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, that one <HI>John Melford</HI> had the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, not only of <HI>Godwell,</HI> but of <HI>Snodbean,</HI> and <HI>Peping&s;traw</HI> likewi&s;e, which his Father purcha&s;ed of the Heirs of <HI>Ditton;</HI> but not long after this, was the Title of tho&s;e places re&s;ident in this Family.

Of this Family was Sir <HI>John Pri&s;ot</HI> the Judge, of whom there is frequent mention in our Law Books, which have an A&s;pect upon the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and in this Name was the Title of this Mannor car|ried down to the eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was by <HI>Thomas Pri&s;ot</HI> pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale to <HI>George Hount,</HI> in whom the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion had not many years been re&s;ident, but the &s;ame Fatality brought it over to <HI>Reginald Strogle,</HI> who was in the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Peace, in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, and was de&s;|cended from a Family which was of a very high Original in <HI>Romney-Mer&s;h,</HI> where there are &s;ome Lands yet which bear their Name. After <HI>Strogle</HI> had left it, it came by Purcha&s;e to Mr. <HI>Bennet Guildford,</HI> a Branch of the <HI>Guildfords</HI> of <HI>Hemp&s;ted,</HI> who in the beginning of the Raign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> falling under the Cen&s;ure and Penalty of a <HI>Pramunire,</HI> for refu&s;ing the Oath of Supremacy, and flying beyond Sea, forfeited this place to the Crown, and this Prince&s;&s;e immediately after pa&s;&s;ed it away by Grant to <HI>Walter Moile</HI> of <HI>Buckwell,</HI> from whom not many years after this original Conce&s;&s;ion, it went away by Sale to Mr. <HI>Francis Bourne,</HI> Grand-father to Mr. ...... <HI>Bourne</HI> the pre&s;ent Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>O&s;pringe</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> was anciently a Limb or Appendage of the Royal Revenue, until King <HI>Edward</HI> the thind, in the tenth year of his Raign, by Royal Conce&s;&s;ion or Grant, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>John de Pultency,</HI> afterwards Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> to hold it in Fee of the Crown, by the Service of a Ro&s;e, offe|red up or pre&s;ented as a Symbol of Annual Fealty, and with this Mannor he granted him likewi&s;e all the Advou&s;ons of-Churches, which formerly related to it, to hold in Soccage only by the former acknowledgement. In the nineteenth year of his Raign, the above &s;aid Prince grants this <HI>John de Pulteney,</HI> that <HI>Thomas</HI> Son of <HI>Willi|am de Dene</HI> &s;hould be accountable to him for all tho&s;e Knights Fees which lay in <HI>Throuley, Boughton, Malherbe,</HI> and <HI>Worme&s;ell,</HI> and held of <HI>Queen Court</HI> and <HI>O&s;pringe:</HI> de died po&s;&s;e&s;t of both the&s;e places, in the twenty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears, <HI>Rot.

<PB N="262" REF="139"><HI>Edward</HI> the fourth) which Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> obtained a an Exemplification by Patent in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, how many Knights Fees which lay divided and di&s;per&s;ed into &s;everall places, belonged to his Mannor of <HI>O&s;pringe;</HI> this Sir <HI>Nicholas</HI> had I&s;&s;ue <HI>Nicholas Loveyne,</HI> and <HI>Margaret Loveyne; Nicholas</HI> her Brother decea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue, and &s;o <HI>Philip St. Clere</HI> of <HI>Aldham St. Clere,</HI> who had matched with this his Si&s;ter, became his Heir, and &s;he was found to be po&s;|&s;e&s;t of the&s;e places at her Death, which was in the tenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and in her Right did it de&s;cend with <HI>Queen Court,</HI> (which was lea&s;ed out by <HI>Nich. Loveyne</HI> to <HI>Nicholas Potin,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> the twenty fir&s;t of King <HI>R.</HI> the &s;econd, and held his Shrievalty at this place) to <HI>Thomas St. Clere</HI> who held it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 46. But after his Departure, I do not find it long knit to the Demea&s;n of his Family; for about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, I find it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>William Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Shurland</HI> E&s;quire, and from him was the Title of <HI>O&s;pringe</HI> and <HI>Queen Court</HI> derived by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Right to his Grandchild <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> who about the thirteenth year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed them away to Mr. <HI>Rich. Thornehill,</HI> Great Grandfather to Mr. <HI>Richard Thornehill,</HI> Son and Heir of Colonel <HI>Richard Thornhill</HI> who is at this in&s;tant Proprietarie of it.</P>
<P><HI>Plomford</HI> and <HI>Bavell,</HI> are two little Mannors in <HI>O&s;pringe,</HI> which belonged partly to the Nunnery of the <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Shepey,</HI> and partly to the Abby of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> which upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e two Cloi&s;ters, were granted by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> E&s;quire, and he not long after, alienated them to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> who&s;e Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed them away in our Grand|fathers Memory to <HI>Green&s;treet</HI> of <HI>Clacksfield</HI> in <HI>Borden,</HI> and are &s;till wrapt up in the In|heritance of that Family.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mai&s;on le Dieu</HI> here at <HI>O&s;pringe,</HI> was founded by <HI>Lucas de Vienna,</HI> for the Knights Templers, and was one of tho&s;e Man&s;ions, where they repo&s;ed them|&s;elves in their progre&s;&s;e towards their other Demea&s;ne, which lay &s;pread into <HI>Ea&s;t-Kent,</HI> and <HI>Romney Mer&s;h.</HI> The Revenue which was to &s;upport this Seminary, lay at <HI>Lurdenden</HI> in <HI>Challock,</HI> and at <HI>Hokeling, Radymer&s;h, Ryde</HI> and other places in the I&s;le of <HI>Shepey.</HI> In the twenty fifth of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Roger de Ling&s;ted</HI> had a Grant of the&s;e Lands, for Terme of Life, as likewi&s;e of all the Fi&s;hery Me&s;&s;u|ages, Relie&s;e, Revenue, and Homage appertaining to them, as appears <HI>Pat.

In the forty &s;econd, and fifty fir&s;t of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, there was a Confirmation of Land and Priviledges to this Hou&s;e, and in this Condition it continued, partly under the Knights Templers, and in lower Ages, under the Knights Ho&s;pitallers, untill the Tempe&s;t of the generall Di&s;&s;o|lution, &s;hook it into that neglected heap of Ruines, wherein at pre&s;ent the ancient Fabrick is vi&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Elverland</HI> in this Pari&s;h is a Mannor which for many Generations hath been annexed to the Demea&s;n of St. <HI>Johns</HI> Colledge in <HI>Cambridge.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Selgrave</HI> now corruptly called <HI>Selgrove,</HI> is another Mannor in <HI>O&s;pringe:</HI> It was a Branch of that large Inheritance, which lay &s;cattered ore the Face of this Terri|tory, and acknowledged the Dominion of the noble Family of <HI>Norwood: Roger de Northwood</HI> held it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 25. And tran&s;mitted it to his Son <HI>Roger de Norwood,</HI> after whom I do not find the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was long permanent in this Family: for about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Ralph de Spigurnell,</HI> was concerned in it as Proprietarie, and he bequeathed it to his Wife <HI>Elizabeth Spigurnell,</HI> who &s;old it to <HI>John Winchel&s;ey,</HI> and the Convent of <HI>Chri&s;t-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the &s;ix|teenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, in whom the Fee-&s;imple continued, untill it was wre&s;ted away by the Generall Di&s;&s;olution in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: and then that Prince, pa&s;&s;ed it by Grant to <HI>George Barley,</HI> who not many years after alienated his Intere&s;t in it to <HI>Sonds</HI> of <HI>Throuley,</HI> from whom in our Fathers Memory, it came by Sale to <HI>Cleve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>O&s;pringe,</HI> had anciently a Hou&s;e or <HI>Mai&s;on le Dieu</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e it was a Receptacle for Leprous people, and other per&s;ons afflicted and a&s;&s;aulted with Di&s;|ea&s;es, which in Times of elder In&s;cription, were &s;till e&s;teemed to be impo&s;ed by the
<PB N="263" REF="139">Finger of the Divinity, and this had a Confirmation of ample Immunities, and Li|berties by Patent in the forty &s;eventh, and which were renued in the fifty fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third.</P>
<P><HI>Otford</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Cod&s;heath,</HI> was given to the Church and Sea of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> by <HI>Offa</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI> in the year 785, to expiate the Guilt of that Blood, which he had before drawn from the Veins of <HI>Aleric</HI> and his <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Men, in a Battell waged at this place, in the year 774, and which was aggravated becau&s;e tho&s;e he had &s;laughtered, had their Names enrolled in the Re|gi&s;ter of Chri&s;tians. And which was granted in the originall Donation, <HI>ad Pa&s;cua Porcorum,</HI> to the Pannage of tho&s;e Hoggs that fed in the Arch-bi&s;hops Cha&s;e; and in the Revenue of this Sea, was the Intere&s;t of this Mannor trea&s;u|red up, till about the Beginning of the Rule of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then &s;ome envious Eyes looking about with Regrett and De&s;ire, upon the Diffu&s;ed Patrimo|ny of the Church, <HI>William Warham</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to extingui&s;h both the pa&s;&s;ions of the&s;e men, and their ravenous Appetite together, about the twelfth year of that Prince's Raign, exchanged this Mannor for other Lands, and &s;o it became in|corporated into the Revenue of the Crown.</P>
<P>There was a Chantry founded at <HI>Rye-hou&s;e</HI> in this Pari&s;h, by <HI>Henry de Apul|derfield,</HI> in the forty &s;ixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears <HI>Pat.

Who&s;e Revenue upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion, was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, granted to <HI>Palmer,</HI> which Family had been of deep Anti|quity before in this Pari&s;h, and from whence the <HI>Palmers</HI> of <HI>Snodland,</HI> and like|wi&s;e of <HI>Howletts</HI> in <HI>Ea&s;t-Kent,</HI> were originally de&s;cended: but it &s;eems the &s;ecu|rity of this royal Patent, could not re&s;cue it from being &s;old &s;ome years after to <HI>Bo&s;vill,</HI> who&s;e De&s;cendant now holds the in&s;tant Fee-&s;imple of it.</P>
<P><HI>Otham</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> was a Branch of that Demea&s;ne, which did in this Track acknowledge the Signiory of the ancient Family of <HI>Valoigns. William de Valoigns,</HI> is mentioned in the Book called <HI>Te&s;ta de Nevill,</HI> to have paid Aid for Lands at <HI>Petham, A&s;hford,</HI> and <HI>Otham,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, at the marriage of <HI>I&s;abell</HI> that Prince's Si&s;ter, and it is probable that this <HI>VVill. de Valoigns,</HI> dyed po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>Otham,</HI> in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, for his Name was <HI>VVilliam</HI> likewi&s;e, as appears by the e&s;cheat Roll, marked with the Number 54. after whom his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Stephen de Valoigns,</HI> held it, who was certainly a man of &s;ome important Account in tho&s;e Times, for he was one of the Con&s;ervators of the Peace, in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Valoigns,</HI> the knightly Family of <HI>Pimpe,</HI> was by purcha&s;e inve&s;ted about the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, both in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Otham</HI> and <HI>Gore-court,</HI> and to this Name was the Inheritance both of <HI>Otham</HI> and <HI>Gore-court,</HI> by a Chain of &s;everall De&s;cents, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively united; till at la&s;t the ordinary Devolution of purcha&s;e brought them over to <HI>I&s;ley</HI> of <HI>Sun|drich;</HI> and within the Circle of this Family, was the Propriety of them circum|&s;cribed, till the &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and then Sir <HI>Hen. I&s;ley,</HI> being fatally engaged and entangled in the un&s;ucce&s;&s;efull Attempt of Sir <HI>Thomas Wiatt,</HI> could not unravell him&s;elf, untill he had &s;atisfied the Ju&s;tice of that Queen, with the forfeiture of his Life, and augmented the Revenue of the Crown, with the Con|fi&s;cation of his E&s;tate: from which the&s;e two places, as being parcell of his e&s;|cheated Patrimony, were by Patent &s;oon after, pa&s;&s;ed away to Sir <HI>Walter Henley,</HI> one of the Serjeants at Law, to the above&s;aid Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue-male, bequeathed <HI>Gore-court</HI> to <HI>Hellen</HI> his Daughter and Coheir, who was matched to <HI>Thomas Colepeper;</HI> and <HI>Otham</HI> to his Brother <HI>Thomas Henley;</HI> from whom it is come down to <HI>Walter Henley</HI> E&s;quire, who is the pre&s;ent Lord of the Fee: but <HI>Gore-court</HI> was by <HI>Colepeper,</HI> demi&s;ed by Sale to <HI>Buffkin;</HI> where after the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion had for &s;everall years been fixed, it was almo&s;t within the Pale of our Remembrance, by purcha&s;e made the pre&s;ent Inheritance of <HI>Tho.

<P><HI>Stoneacre</HI> in this Pari&s;h is an Ancient Seat, which for &s;ome Centuries of years has acknowledged no other Proprietary then <HI>Ellys,</HI> but whether <HI>Burton</HI> in <HI>Kenington,</HI> or this Man&s;ion were the original Fountain, from whence this Family did extract
<PB N="264" REF="140">its fir&s;t Etymology is incertain, for once they had one and the &s;ame Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.

<P>There was the Foundation of a Religious Seminary of Canons, <HI>Praemon&s;traten&s;es</HI> or white Canons, begun at <HI>Otham</HI> by <HI>Ralph de Dene:</HI> but the Situation of the Place, being not accommodated to Health, they were by <HI>Ela de Sackvil</HI> removed and tran&s;|planted into her new erected Priory at <HI>Begham,</HI> where till the common Suppre&s;&s;ion they continued undi&s;turbed and fixed.</P>
<P><HI>Otteringdon</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Eyhorne,</HI> does repre&s;ent to us in Pro&s;pect the Me|mory of a Family, to whom it contributed in Times more Arcient both Seat and Sirname. <HI>Ralph de Ottringden</HI> held it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 29. But in his Son Sir <HI>Lawrence de Ottringden,</HI> both the Name and Male Line failed together, for his Daughter and Heir brought it along with her to <HI>Peyforer,</HI> who about the latter end of the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was extingui&s;hed likewi&s;e by the &s;ame Fatality in <HI>Julian Peyforer,</HI> who was his Heir General, and &s;he, by e&s;pou&s;ing <HI>Thomas St. Leger</HI> E&s;quire, intermixed the Right of this place with the Inheritance of this Family, and who lies entombed in this Church, with this Compendious Super&s;cription endor&s;ed upon his Grave|&s;tone, <HI>Hic jacet Thomas St. Leger de Otteringden, qui obiit</HI> 1408. But a Revolution as &s;uddain as the former, quickly &s;natched away <HI>Otteringden</HI> from the Patrimony of this Name; for by <HI>Joan,</HI> who was Co-heir to the above-mentioned <HI>Thomas St. Leger,</HI> it was rowled into the Revenue of <HI>Henry Aucher</HI> E&s;quire &s;prouted out from the Illu&s;trious Stem of <HI>Aucher</HI> of <HI>Lo&s;enham,</HI> and in this Family was the In|tere&s;t of this place &s;ucce&s;&s;ively laid up till the Time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then the whole Demi&s;e was by Sale tran&s;mitted to <HI>Lewin,</HI> in whom a De&s;cent or two after the Male-Line determining, the Female Heir brought it to <HI>Rogers</HI> of the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> from whom the like Fatality hath lately devolved it to <HI>Charles</HI> Lord <HI>Mansfeld,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Right Honorable <HI>William Cavendi&s;h,</HI> Marque&s;s of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Putwood</HI> is another Mannor in this Pari&s;h, which in Times of elder Etymology, did acknowlede it &s;elf to be under the Signory of a Family, who extracted their Sirname from <HI>Vienne</HI> in <HI>Dauphine</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and in &s;everal Deeds without Date, there is mention of <HI>William de Vienna,</HI> who was inve&s;ted in Land here at <HI>Putwood</HI> and <HI>O&s;pringe,</HI> and in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Lucas de Vienna</HI> paid re|&s;pective Supply, at the making the Black Prince Knight, for Lands which he held at <HI>Putwood</HI> and <HI>O&s;pringe.</HI> After this Family was di&s;&s;olved and gone, the <HI>Quadrings,</HI> which was about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, were &s;ettled in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on, where after &s;ome &s;mall Re&s;idence of the Title, it went away by Sale about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to the Ancient Family of <HI>Goldwell</HI> of great <HI>Chart:</HI> and here, after it had made &s;ome cur&s;ory aboad, the &s;ame Devolution ca&s;t it into the Inheritance of <HI>Dryland</HI> of <HI>Cokes-ditch</HI> in <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> to who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion after the Title had, for many years cleaved, it was tran&s;ported by purcha&s;e into the Patri|mony of <HI>Atwater,</HI> &s;o &s;tyled, becau&s;e it is probable this Family had formerly their Re&s;idence near &s;ome Fountain or Stream, but their Original from whence they pri|mitively i&s;&s;ued, was from about <HI>O&s;pringe:</HI> for there I find <HI>Robert Atwater</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t Land at his Death, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and in this Name did the Title of the place lie couched, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then by Sale it was incorporated into the Revenue of Sir <HI>James Hales:</HI> but long it remained not thus mingled, for the Fate of purcha&s;e untwi&s;ted it, and not many years after threw it into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Sayer,</HI> from whom in Times which almo&s;t bordered upon our Memory, it was by Sale wafted over to Mr. <HI>James Hugi&s;on</HI> of <HI>Dover,</HI> and he bequeathed it to a &s;econd Son, who&s;e Female Heir Mrs. <HI>Jane Hugi&s;on,</HI> by lately matching with Mr. <HI>John Roberts</HI> E&s;quire, elde&s;t Son to Sir <HI>John Roberts</HI> of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> hath entituled him to the Propriety of it.</P>

<P><HI>Swerdling</HI> is a Mannor in this Pari&s;h of as eminent Account as any in this Track, and was the Capital Man&s;ion of the Noble and ancient Family of <HI>Valoigns.

Robert de Valoigns</HI> had the Repute of a Baron in the thirteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and under that Notion held the fourth part of a Knights Fee of <HI>Wallingford</HI> Ca&s;tle. <HI>Allan de Valoigns,</HI> was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the thirty fir&s;t, thirty &s;econd, thirty third, and thirty fourth years of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and held his Shrievalty at <HI>Swerdling.

<P><HI>Sapinton</HI> in <HI>Petham</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Bregge;</HI> for in the forty &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, I find <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Hauts-place</HI> in this Pari&s;h was the Fountain from whence that noble Family which fell under that Sirname originally &s;treamed out, which afterwards di&s;per&s;ed it &s;elf in &s;ub-divided Rivolets over the face of this County. <HI>Ivo de Haut,</HI> the fir&s;t of this Name that ancient Record repre&s;ents to us, is mentioned in a Book kept in the Exchequer called <HI>Liber de Terris Templariorum,</HI> which is a Survey of tho&s;e Lands that Order held in <HI>England</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> One thou&s;and one hundred and eighty; and there it is
<PB N="275" REF="145">affirmed that he held this Mannor of <HI>Temple Waltham,</HI> and from this <HI>Ivo de Haut</HI> did the Title in a never-ebbing Current of De&s;cent glide down to Sir <HI>William Haut,</HI> who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the &s;ixteenth year, and then again promoted to that Office in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and not long after decea&s;ed, and with him the Name found its Funeral in two Daughters and Co-heirs, one of which termed <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was matched to <HI>Thomas Colepeper</HI> of <HI>Bedgebury</HI> E&s;quire, to whom this place in the right of his Wife devolved. And from his Family in the Age within the con|fines of our Grand-fathers Remembrance, it was pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale to <HI>Salkeld,</HI> who not many years &s;ince conveyed the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion over to <HI>Bateman.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Chauntry founded at <HI>Depden</HI> in this Pari&s;h (as appears by a Manu&s;cript in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Thomas Den</HI> Recorder of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> lately decea&s;ed,) founded and endowed by <HI>William Gratian</HI> Prie&s;t in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth; Who&s;e Re|venue upon the Di&s;&s;olution of this Chauntry in the &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, was granted to <HI>Jo.

<P><HI>Po&s;tling</HI> lies in the Hundred of <HI>Hene,</HI> and was, in Ages of a very high A&s;cent, the Patrimony of the Noble Family of <HI>Columbers,</HI> a Name in Times of elder Cogni&s;ance of very great reputation in the <HI>We&s;t</HI> of <HI>England; Philip de Columbariis</HI> or <HI>Columbers,</HI> held it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot.

The next that is repre|&s;ented to be Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, is <HI>Hugh de Audley,</HI> and he held it as appears by ancient Court-rolls in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and pa&s;&s;ed it a|way to <HI>Delves</HI> of <HI>Delves Court</HI> in the County of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> where it &s;eems it had no long aboad; for about the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John de Delves</HI> alienates it to <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundell;</HI> for which the Earl is pardoned, becau&s;e he purcha&s;ed it without Licen&s;e fir&s;t obtained from the King as appears, <HI>Pat. de An^o</HI> 43. <HI>Edw. tertii Parte &s;ecunda Memb. &s;eptim.</HI> And in this Family was it for many Generations fixed and re&s;ident; until the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was by Sale tran&s;mitted to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher.</HI> But the Tenure of it in this Family was brief and Tran&s;itory; for about the Beginning of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> it went away from this Name to <HI>Robert Cranmer</HI> E&s;quire, Nephew to <HI>Thomas Cranmer</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury,</HI> who expiring in a Female Heir, &s;he brought it along with her to Sir <HI>Arthur Harris</HI> of <HI>Crixey</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> from whom it is devolved to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Cranmer Harris,</HI> who holds the in&s;tant Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P><HI>Henewood</HI> is another Mannor in this Pari&s;h, from whence the <HI>Honywood</HI> of <HI>Elm|&s;ted,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Pett</HI> in <HI>Charing</HI> do extract their Sirname: And <HI>Edmund de Honywood</HI> who in the raign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the third is remembred in the Front and Van of tho&s;e in the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Horton</HI> Priory, who were munificent Benefactors to that Covent, is &s;et down there to have been of <HI>Po&s;tling,</HI> and as this Place was then, &s;o is it &s;till through all that Flux and Decur&s;ion of Time which hath &s;ince elap&s;ed, wound up in that revenue, which acknowledges the Signorie and Jurisdiction of this ancient Name and Family.</P>
<P><HI>Pluckley</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Calehill,</HI> was originally a Mannor which owned the Arch-bi&s;hops of <HI>Canterbury</HI> for Lords of the Fee, until <HI>Lanfranc</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> gave it to <HI>William</HI> Brother of <HI>John de Cobham,</HI> who in the Grant is &s;tyled <HI>Miles Archiepi&s;copi;</HI> not that he was ever any Knight or Souldier that attended upon him; but that he granted him this Mannor to hold in Knights Service of him and his Succe&s;&s;ors, which was very u&s;ual and cu&s;tomary for the Arch-bi&s;hops and other great Prelates to do; until King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t growing jealous of the Power and Gran|deur of the Clergie, who endeavoured by their Bounty and magnificent Donations to oblige both the principal of the Nobility and Gentry, and chain them up by the&s;e extraordinary Engagements to their Devotion, cau&s;ed the Statute called <HI>Quia emptores Terrarum,</HI> in the one and twentieth of his raign to be made, which re&s;trains and
<PB N="276" REF="146">&s;uper&s;edes for the future all new Creations of Mannors. But to proceed, <HI>VVilliam de Cobham</HI> being thus en&s;tated in this Mannor, in Gratitude to the fir&s;t Donor, al|tered his Name from <HI>Cobham</HI> to <HI>Pluckley.</HI> Sir <HI>Richard de Pluckley</HI> this mans Grand|child, flouri&s;hed in the raign of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, and founded the Church at <HI>Pluckley;</HI> and from this man did <HI>VVilliam de Pluckley</HI> lineally branch out, in whom the Male-Line concluded, &s;o that <HI>Agnes</HI> his Daughter and Heir, by matching with <HI>John Surrenden</HI> E&s;quire, ca&s;t <HI>Pluckley</HI> into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Name and Family: where it had not long &s;ojourned, when the &s;ame Vici&s;&s;itude brought it over to <HI>Haut:</HI> for <HI>James Haut</HI> wedded <HI>Joan</HI> Heir General of <HI>John Surrenden,</HI> and &s;o became Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of <HI>Pluckley;</HI> but in this Name the Title was as volatile and mu|table as in the former: for this man went out in Daughters and Co-heirs, one of them was wedded to <HI>Gouldwell,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> the other was matched to <HI>John Dering</HI> E&s;quire, in who&s;e Right he was entituled to the Signory of <HI>Pluckley.</HI> Now if you will inquire, where lay the ancient Land of <HI>Dering,</HI> if my A&s;&s;ertion might be cre|dited, I &s;hould affirm, that it was at <HI>Stamford</HI> by <HI>Hieth,</HI> where they were Lords of &s;ome part of the little Mannot of <HI>Heyton:</HI> for by an old Roll, I find that <HI>Nor|manus de Morinis,</HI> married <HI>Kineburga</HI> Daughter and Heir of <HI>Deringus,</HI> and his Son as was Cu&s;tomary in tho&s;e Times, called him&s;elf <HI>Deringus de Morinis,</HI> and matched with <HI>Elveva</HI> Si&s;ter and Heir of <HI>Alanus de Heyton,</HI> and &s;o was inve&s;ted in the Proprie|ty of the Mannor of <HI>Heyton,</HI> from whom it &s;ucce&s;&s;ively came down to <HI>Richard Fitz Dering,</HI> who was Son of <HI>Dering,</HI> and great Grand-child to this man, who was the fir&s;t who de&s;erted the Sirname <HI>de Morinis,</HI> and a&s;&s;umed that of <HI>Dering,</HI> and died po&s;&s;e&s;t of the Mannor of <HI>Heyton,</HI> in the forty &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. And from this <HI>Richard Fitz Dering</HI> is Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> Baronet, now lineally extracted, who is the in&s;tant Lord of <HI>Pluckley</HI> and <HI>Surrenden Dering,</HI> where Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> Knight and Baronet, not many years &s;ince decea&s;ed, rai&s;ed that elegant Structure, as eminent for its Magnificence and Beauty, as it is for its Contrivance and Curio|&s;ity.</P>
<P><HI>Pevington</HI> was formerly a Pari&s;h, and had a Church dedicated to St. <HI>Mary,</HI> though it be now langui&s;hed into Di&s;-u&s;e, and grown an adjunct to <HI>Pluckley;</HI> The Patrons as well as Proprietaries of it were the <HI>Pevingtons,</HI> a Knightly Family, who borrowed their Sirname from hence. The fir&s;t whom I meet with, is Sir <HI>Ralph de Pevington,</HI> who flouri&s;hed here, in the raign of King <HI>John,</HI> and King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and was Father to Sir <HI>William de Pevington,</HI> who likewi&s;e died po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Mannor, in the fifty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, from whom de&s;cended <HI>John</HI> and <HI>William Pevington,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, in the &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Amabilia</HI> their Si&s;ter, matched to <HI>John Gobion,</HI> became their Heir, and &s;he lies buried in the Church of <HI>Au&s;tin-Friars</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and is mentioned to have been a liberal Benefactre&s;&s;e to that Cloi&s;ter, about the Time of her Decea&s;e, which was 1405. and had I&s;&s;ue by him <HI>Julian</HI> their only Daughter, who was about the twenty &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, matched to <HI>William Brent,</HI> from whom de&s;cended <HI>Thomas Brent,</HI> in whom the Name and Male-Line together was extin|gui&s;hed, &s;o that <HI>Margaret Brent</HI> matched to <HI>John Dering,</HI> was the vi&s;ible Heir of his E&s;tate, among&s;t which this Mannor of <HI>Pevington,</HI> was enwrapped, which came down in Right of this Alliance to Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> Knight and Baronet, who up|on his Decea&s;e gave it after the Death of his Mother, the Widow Dowager of Sir <HI>Anthony Dering,</HI> to Mr. <HI>Henry Dering,</HI> the elde&s;t Son by his la&s;t Lady.</P>
<P><HI>Malmains</HI> in <HI>Pluckley,</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family of that Sirname. <HI>Elea|nor</HI> Wife of <HI>John de Malmins</HI> died &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the fourteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 51. And after by Court-rols, I di&s;cover <HI>Henry Malmains</HI> to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, from whom it de&s;cended to <HI>Richard Malmains,</HI> who died (as the Date upon his Tomb-&s;tone in <HI>Plukley</HI> Church di&s;covers to us) in the year 1440. and left <HI>John Malmains</HI> his Heir, after whom I de&s;cry no farther mention of this Family; at this place: The next Family which &s;ucceeded in the Inheritance was <HI>Dering,</HI> not by any Right derived from <HI>Haut:</HI> for they had e&s;pou&s;ed the Heir of that Name before <HI>Malmains</HI> was extingui&s;hed: nor could it be by any Female Heir atchieved, for there were but two Co-heirs of this Branch of <HI>Malmains,</HI> who were wedded to <HI>Monins</HI> and <HI>Gouldwell.</HI> And if it be an&s;wered that <HI>Dering</HI> married the
<PB N="277" REF="146">Heir of the elde&s;t Hou&s;e: To that I an&s;wer, that <HI>Nicholas Malmains,</HI> who was of the elder Line, decea&s;ed in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot.

<P><HI>Shurland</HI> is the la&s;t place of Account: It hath been the Patrimony of <HI>Betenham</HI> of <HI>Be|tenham</HI> in <HI>Cranbroke,</HI> for many Hundred years. <HI>Stephen de Betenham</HI> is mentioned in Court-rols, which take their Ri&s;e or Date from the Government of <HI>Hen,</HI> the third: and certainly this is that <HI>Stephen de Betenham,</HI> which is mentioned to be one of the <HI>Re|cognitores Magnae A&s;&s;i&s;ae,</HI> (an Office of very great Importance in elder Times) in tho&s;e Pipe-rols, which relate to the raign of King <HI>John;</HI> and from this <HI>Stephen</HI> hath the Title of this place, by a con&s;tant and even Chain of Ages, threaded together into an unbroken Succe&s;&s;ion, come down to Mr. <HI>Betenham,</HI> who holds the pre&s;ent Sig|nory and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>

<P><HI>St. Johns</HI> is the la&s;t Mannor in <HI>Rodmer&s;ham,</HI> to be taken Notice of; though the Fir&s;t in its Degree of Eminence becau&s;e it was a principal place belonging to the Knights Ho&s;pitallers. An Order that was e&s;tabli&s;hed and in&s;tituted by <HI>Gerardus,</HI> but fenced in, and empaled with New Orders and Rules, by <HI>Raimundus a Podio,</HI> le&s;t, debauched and &s;oftned by &s;ecular Intere&s;t, in Decur&s;ion of Time, they might have &s;allied out into &s;ome Di&s;order and Exce&s;&s;e. At their fir&s;t In&s;tallment, they were to be eighteen years of Age, at lea&s;t, and none who were without the Verge of that Time, were capable of this Order: they were to be neither of Jewi&s;h nor Turki&s;h Extraction, le&s;t they might &s;eem tacitly to wrap up tho&s;e principles in their Blood, which by their Vow, they were engaged to de&s;troy. Their Pedigree or Genealogie, was to be wholly Chri&s;tian, and that of no coor&s;e, but of a more refined Temperament; for their Birth or Parentage was to be noble, and that not to be &s;ullied with the impure Tincture of Ba&s;tardy. Yet even this Re&s;triction had a gentler &s;en&s;e quilted into it, for if they were the Natural Sons of Princes, their Birth was enobled, and the Rigor of the Rule, was by &s;o eminent a De&s;cent &s;oftned and allayed, and they made capable of this Order. Then they were by a general Obligation, to defend the Sepulchre of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> to protect Pilgrims, again&s;t the Eruptions of Infidels, in their vi&s;its made to the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> to foment no Clande&s;tine Animo&s;ities, by engaging in private Duells among&s;t them|&s;elves, which were bla&s;ted with the Black Character of Illegality; and if the Princes of Chri&s;tedome were entangled in inte&s;tine Di&s;&s;entions among&s;t them&s;elves, they were to &s;hroud them&s;elves, under an impartial Neutrality, le&s;t they might de&s;troy
<PB N="284" REF="150">that Chri&s;tianity, which by Oath they were obliged to a&s;&s;ert, if they &s;hould embark in any impious Sidings, or partial Combinations. La&s;tly, they were ab&s;tracted by their Vow of Poverty, Cha&s;tity and Obedience, from all &s;ecular Employments, or Negotiations, le&s;t the Fumes of Temporal Intere&s;t might cloud their Eyes, in their pro&s;pect towards the Sepulchre; in order to which, they were not to exerci&s;e any Mercantile Affairs, or the De&s;igns of U&s;ury; they were, if po&s;&s;ible, to receive the Sacrament thrice every year, and if not interrupted to hear Ma&s;&s;e once a day. I have now done with the Ingredients which made up their Vow, I &s;hall now come to the form of their In&s;tallment.</P>
<P>As for the Method of their Inve&s;titure, it was ca&s;t into this Mould. They had a Sword delivered to them, intimating they &s;hould fight with Magnanimity; and this was guarded with a Cro&s;&s;e Hilt, to declare that they were in all Encounters to vindicate and maintain the Cro&s;&s;e and Sepulchre of our Saviour. Then they were &s;truck thrice over the Shoulders with that Sword they were inve&s;ted with, to in&s;inuate, that they &s;hould &s;u&s;tain all Contumelies and Indignities, for the Cau&s;e and Defence of Chri&s;tian Religion. Then fourthly, this Sword was wiped, to in&s;truct them that their Lives were to be a&s;&s;oiled from the Spot of all open and &s;candalous Impieties. Fifthly, they had guilt Spurs placed upon their Heels, to &s;hew fir&s;t, that all temporal Im|provement of Wealth, was to be ca&s;t behind the De&s;igns of Piety and Religion; or &s;econdly, to demon&s;trate, that Riches were but the Glo&s;&s;e, or Parjet, but Ho|nor and Vertue, was the Solid Body, de&s;igned by the Spur it &s;elf, that was to &s;upport and &s;u&s;tain it. Sixthly, they had a lighted Taper put into their Hands, by that, to di&s;cover, that by an eminent Integritie and exemplar Piety, like the Irradiation of that Luminary, they were to make them&s;elves con&s;picuous to tho&s;e who were involved in the Mi&s;ts and Umbrages of a dark and gloomy Infidelity. La&s;tly, after the&s;e Formalities performed, they were obliged to repair to Ma&s;&s;e, where I leave them.</P>
<P>Their Cu&s;tomary Habit was a black Cloak, being the be&s;t En&s;igne, or Symptome of a &s;olemne external Sorrow, and on this was a <HI>Cro&s;&s;e potent between four Cro&s;&s;es Patee,</HI> de&s;igning the five wounds of our Saviour; they wore con&s;tantly when they appeared in publique, a red Belt, intimating they were at all times ready to bleed, in Defence of the Cro&s;&s;e and Sepulcher, and on that was fixed a white Cro&s;&s;e, to manife&s;t the Purity and Innocence of that Cau&s;e and Religion which was con|tended for.</P>
<P>This Order was fir&s;t brought into <HI>England,</HI> in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1100, by <HI>Jordan de Bri&s;et,</HI> in &s;ome old Deeds written <HI>Brin&s;et,</HI> Lord of <HI>Well-hall</HI> at <HI>Eltham</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Muriell</HI> his Wife, who founded a Hou&s;e for them at <HI>Clerkenwell,</HI> and dedicated it to St. <HI>John,</HI> which afterwards became the Head of their <HI>Alberge</HI> here in <HI>England,</HI> to which this Mannor continued united, as parcell of their Demea&s;ne, untill the Di&s;&s;olution in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, like a general Deluge, &s;wept it away, and tran&s;ported it into the Revenue of the Crown, and that Prince by Royal Con|ce&s;&s;ion, made it the E&s;tate of <HI>William Pordage</HI> E&s;quire, in who&s;e De&s;cendant, <HI>Thomas Pordage</HI> E&s;quire, the pre&s;ent Inheritance of it remains at this in&s;tant placed.</P>
<P><HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> is a City which in elder Times, was as eminent for its Antiquity, as it was for its Strength and Grandeur; and had not tho&s;e violent Impre&s;&s;ions, which the rough hand of War formerly defaced it with, demoli&s;hed its Bulke, and di&s;compo&s;ed its Beau|ty, it peradventure might have been regi&s;tred at this day in the Inventory of the prin|cipal Cities of this Nation. It was governed by a Port Reve, until King <HI>Edw.</HI> the fourth, in the &s;econd year of his Reign, rai&s;ed it into a higher Dignity, and decreed by his royal Grant, that it &s;hould thenceforth be governed by a Maior and twelve Aldermen, and to this Monarch does this City owe much of its pre&s;ent Felicity, a Prince certainly he was, full of Complacence and Benignity, of a munificent Mind, and an obliging acco&s;table Nature, guilty onely of &s;ome humane Frailties, common to all, and adorned with many &s;ignal Virtues, &s;carce re&s;ident in any one, who did not voluntarily &s;ail into that Sea of Blood, which was let loo&s;e in the Civil War, commenced between Him, and the Parti&s;ans of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> but rather was driven into it, by the Tempe&s;t of his ill Fortune.</P>

<P>Having repre&s;ented the City in its Modern Face or A&s;pect, I &s;hall now draw the Curtain &s;omething wider, and di&s;cover its Pourtracture in its calamitous Sufferings, occa&s;ioned by the Inva&s;ions, not only of an entaged Enemy, but likewi&s;e, which is wor&s;e, by the On&s;ets of its own incen&s;ed Prince; and the&s;e two mixing together have much di&s;ordered the Ancient Glory and Splendor of it.</P>
<P>In the year 680. <HI>Eldred</HI> King of <HI>Mercia</HI> harra&s;&s;ed <HI>Kent,</HI> and by an impetuous In|road laid it wa&s;t. And as particular Lamentations are not di&s;tingui&s;hable in univer&s;al Groans; &s;o in this publick Depopulation of the County (then Kingdome,) the Tra|gedy and Deva&s;tation acted by that Prince, at that Time, upon this City, was not re&s;ented with that Regret, as &s;o deplorable Ruine might &s;eem to exact, which had it been &s;ingly poured out upon this City, it could not have been repeated or re|hear&s;ed without a bleeding Heart, and a weeping Eye.</P>
<P>In the year 986.

<P>In the year 999. the <HI>Danes</HI> invaded <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and though by the vigorous Re|&s;i&s;tance and Magnanimity of the Defendants, their A&s;&s;aults were made null, yet at length by the treacherous Combination of an in&s;idious Party within, it was ra|ther betrayed then &s;ubdued, and mi&s;erably depopulated by the Barbarous Adver|&s;ary, the Signatures of which Deva&s;tation are yet vi&s;ible: and though the widene&s;s of the Orifice, which that wound had made, be &s;omething clo&s;ed up with the Hand of Time, yet there is a huge Scar left, to repre&s;ent to Po&s;terity the Greatne&s;s of the former Ruine. After they had thus harra&s;&s;ed and defaced that City, they (to improve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">heir Victory) advanced to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> where the Inhabitants a&s;toni&s;hed with an Example of &s;o much Terror, after &s;ome faint Oppo&s;ition again&s;t the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Im|pre&s;&s;ions and On&s;ets, gave them&s;elves up to Flight, and this City to a Calamitous Depopulation.</P>
<P>In the year 1130. <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, with the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> were pre|&s;ent at the Con&s;ecration of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Church in <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> which was then brought to perfection, having been before much empaired by the Iron Teeth of Time: But then the Fury of the Elements began to enter into a Corrival&s;hip or Competition with the Fury of Enemies; for by a ca&s;ual Eruption of an Accidental Fire, the whole City almo&s;t found an infortunate Sepulchre in its own A&s;hes: But it &s;eems like a Phaenix, it ro&s;e again into new Beauty and Order out of the&s;e A&s;hes and Embers, but did not long continue in this Condition; for in the year of Grace 1177. which was in the Time of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, it was again a&s;&s;aulted by the Outrage and Fu|ry of this implacable Element, the Impre&s;&s;ions and remaining Signatures of which Conflagration, are obvious to the In&s;pection of an Inqui&s;itive Eye, even until this Day.</P>
<P>In the year 1225. it was by the Indulgent Bounty of King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in|ve&s;ted with a Wall, and that this Fortification might be of more Concernment, it was likewi&s;e &s;ecured or fenced with a Ditch.</P>

This Accumulation of Offices and Dignities, could not &s;o ingage this above|mentioned <HI>Odo,</HI> to the Intere&s;t of <HI>William Rufus</HI> his Nephew; but that he fir&s;t en|wrapped him&s;elf in a Combination with &s;ome of the di&s;contented Nobility, who&s;e Endeavors were to ravi&s;h the Scepter out of the Hand of that Prince, and place it in the hand of <HI>Robert</HI> Duke of <HI>Normandy,</HI> his elde&s;t Brother, and afterwards to fortifie this De|&s;ign, &s;tarted out into an open Defection and &s;ei&s;ed upon this Ca&s;tle of <HI>Roche&s;ter:</HI> but <HI>William Rufus</HI> with &s;o much Expedition and Courage cru&s;hed the&s;e Attempts, that they became abortive: for in the year 1088. he be&s;ieges his Uncle <HI>Odo</HI> in this Fortre&s;s, and pre&s;&s;es upon him with &s;o much Vigor and Animo&s;ity, that he forces him to &s;urrender to di&s;cretion, but though he took not away his Life, he did that of his Liberty, and &s;ent him Pri&s;oner to <HI>Tunbridge-ca&s;tle,</HI> not under the Notion of Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bajeux;</HI> for that would have infringed and invaded the Franchi&s;es of the Church, but under that of the Earl of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>After this there was by the mediation and umpirage of <HI>Robert Fitz Hamon,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> a Compo&s;ition made between <HI>William Rufus</HI> and <HI>Gundulphus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> the Re&s;ult of which was this: The Prince was to confirm the Mannor of <HI>Hedenham</HI> to this Sea, and the Bi&s;hop, to ballance this Conce&s;&s;ion with &s;omething which had the Face of Retribution, was to expend &s;ixty pound, in &s;ome additions to the Ca&s;tle, and accordingly erected the great &s;quare Tower, a Mor|&s;el which hath been too hard for the Teeth of Time, and by the va&s;tne&s;s of the in|&s;tant remaining Skeleton, witne&s;&s;es the &s;trength of it to Po&s;terity, when it was in
<PB N="287" REF="151">its primitive Grandeur, before the Rage of War, and the Fury of Elements threw it into this wild Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion; yet it is even in this &s;hattered Condition, a better Alphabet to the Memory of the Bi&s;hop its fir&s;t Founder, then his own Mo|nument or Repo&s;itory, for that lies entered in forgotten and neglected Ruines, but this &s;till pre&s;erves his Name, and is called <HI>Gundulphus's</HI> Tower.</P>
<P>And being thus improved and fortified, with the&s;e new Acce&s;&s;ions, it is not to be wondered at, that this Piece, was of that &s;ignal E&s;timate, in elder Times, that King <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, by the Advice of his Councel, in the year 1126, granted the Cu&s;tody of this Ca&s;tle, and the Office of Ca&s;tellan, annexed to it, to <HI>William</HI> the then pre&s;ent Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors, with free liberty to erect a Tower, that is another Fortre&s;&s;e, equivalent or Corre&s;pondent to <HI>Gundulphs</HI> Tower, which before was erected for the Defence of this City and Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>In Times &s;ucceeding to the&s;e, that is, in the year 1215, <HI>William de Albineto</HI> or <HI>Al|biniaco,</HI> in the Latine of tho&s;e Times, and written <HI>D' Albinet,</HI> in the U&s;age of ours, was Governour of this Fortre&s;&s;e, for the factious party of the mutinous Barons, who were then in actual Arms again&s;t King <HI>John,</HI> but this Prince inve&s;ted it with a formal Leaguer, and after the bloody Debate of a three Moneths Siege, forces the above-mentioned <HI>D' Albinet</HI> to a Surrender, wherein though the Virtue of the Op|ponent, was con&s;iderable, yet it was ruinous to him, and the Event hath left us Faith enough to believe, that Strength without the Concurrence of a Loyal Prin|ciple which may &s;upport it, is like an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Reed, which ordinarily runs into the Fingers, and wounds them which lean upon it.</P>
<P>In the year after this, the Nobility, then combined and in Arms again&s;t King <HI>John,</HI> finding that their Forces were much empaired and dimini&s;hed by &s;everall un|&s;uccesful Encounters with that Prince, and that they mu&s;t be forced to re&s;ign them|&s;elves up to tho&s;e rigorous Conditions that he would impo&s;e upon them, called in <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>Dolphin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> who landing in the I&s;le of <HI>Thanett,</HI> with a con&s;iderable Army, advanced to <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and by the concurrent A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Barons, who had united their &s;trength with his, made &s;uch a furious On&s;et upon this Ca&s;tle, that like a Tempe&s;t which bears down all before it, he carried it by A&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>In the year 1264. broke out that fatal Conte&s;t between <HI>Simon Montfort</HI> Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the Foundation or Original of which was this. That Earl being the great A&s;&s;ertor of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty again&s;t the turbulent Eruptions of Forrainers, endeavoured to tear away tho&s;e Strangers, that being placed too near the Royal Throne, had ob&s;tructed and forelaid all the Avenues and Pa&s;&s;ages both to the Heart and Eare of that Prince: and this di&s;mal cla&s;hing (like the Colli&s;ion of two Flints) was productive of &s;o wa&s;ting and de&s;tructive a Fire, that it had like, not only to have con&s;umed the Crown and Scepter, but likewi&s;e to have ca&s;t the whole Kingdome it &s;elf into a heap of Flame and Ruines, &s;ome Sparks of which were dart|ed hither. For this Earl about the Time above &s;pecified begirt the City and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> with a powerful Army, and that he might multiply all Advantages to him&s;elf, which might inforce his De&s;ign, and intercept the Succour intended the Be&s;ieged, he burned the Bridge, who&s;e Frame was then made up of Wood, and de&s;troyed a Fortre&s;s that was placed upon it, which was compounded of the &s;ame Materials, and having effected this, he pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard upon the Ca&s;tle, that he not only pillaged the adjacent Church and Abby, but likewi&s;e &s;ubdued the outward Ward or Gate, and had certainly by an ab&s;olute Conque&s;t at chieved the whole, had not King <HI>Henry</HI> arrived mo&s;t opportunely, and by a &s;uccesful encounter wre&s;ted both Earl <HI>Warren,</HI> who had &s;o vigorou&s;ly maintained it, and that likewi&s;e, from the Im|pre&s;&s;ions of his Fury.</P>
<P>After this, I find little of Moment to have been acted at this place, only I find the Ca&s;tle to have been depo&s;ited in the Hands of &s;everal eminent Per&s;ons, who were extracted from Families, who&s;e Blood was of as noble a Tincture as any in this County, and the&s;e held it under the Notion of <HI>Ca&s;tellani</HI> or Guardians of it, an Office of a very important Concernment in elder Times. The fir&s;t of which, who was entru&s;ted with it, was <HI>William St. Clere,</HI> who&s;e Ancient Seat, before his Suc|ce&s;&s;or by the Match of the Coheir of <HI>Aldham</HI> removed to <HI>Ightam,</HI> was at <HI>Woodland</HI> in <HI>King&s;down,</HI> and he died in the Tenure of this place, in the forty eighth year of
<PB N="288" REF="152"><HI>Henry</HI> the third. After him, I di&s;cover <HI>Robert de Hougham</HI> Lord of <HI>Hougham</HI> by <HI>Dover,</HI> to have had the Cu&s;tody of it, and he died inve&s;ted in this Office, in the &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and in the next year after <HI>Robert de Septuans,</HI> from whom the <HI>Harfleets</HI> of <HI>Ea&s;t-Kent</HI> are de&s;cended, had the Care and Command of it. In Times of a nearer Approach to us, I find <HI>William Keriel</HI> or <HI>Criol,</HI> was entru&s;ted with the Care and Government of it, and was po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Charge at his Death, in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth. After who&s;e <HI>Exit,</HI> the Cu&s;tody was committed to <HI>Thomas</HI> Lord <HI>Cobham,</HI> and he held it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the eleventh year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth. But after this, it began &s;o to langui&s;h away into its own Ruines, that it grew rather an Object of Pity, than of Envy, and re&s;ted among&s;t the Mannors of the Crown, untill King <HI>James,</HI> in the &s;eventh year of his Reign, granted that goodly Skeleton of the Ca&s;tle, which yet courts the Eye of the Beholder, to an Admiration of its former Strength, with all the Services annexed to it, to Sir <HI>Anthony Weldon,</HI> of <HI>Swan&s;camp,</HI> who&s;e Son and Heir <HI>Ralph Weldon</HI> of <HI>Swan&s;camp</HI> E&s;quire, is the in&s;tant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P>There is much Land in this County held of this Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Tenure is perfect Ca&s;tleguard: for upon the Day prefixed for the di&s;charge of the quitt-Rent, relating to it, there is a Banner di&s;plaid and hung out (anciently it was over the Ca&s;tle-Wall) and all tho&s;e who are Tenants to this Mannor, and are in Default by their non-Appearance, and do not di&s;charge their Cu&s;tomary Duties, and Services, the Penaltie impo&s;ed up|on their Neglect, is, that the Return of every Tide of the adjacent River which finds them Ab&s;ent, doubles their Service or quitt-Rent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bridge</HI> which is almo&s;t contiguous to the Root or Ba&s;is, was anciently, when the Frame was of Timber, removed to a farther Di&s;tance, and cro&s;&s;ed the Stream, over again&s;t the Ho&s;pital of St <HI>Maries,</HI> at <HI>Stroude.</HI> But this was by <HI>Simon de Montfort</HI> when he be&s;ieged <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> ruined by Fire, and although it was re-edified and repai|red not long after, yet &s;ome twenty years &s;ub&s;equent to this Misfortune, it was &s;wept away by Ice, &s;o that it appears the Elements entered into a Corrival&s;hip or Compe|tition, which &s;hould make the mo&s;t ruinous Impre&s;&s;ion, on this infortunate Structure.</P>
<P>But after this, that is, in the raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, all tho&s;e above-men|tioned Dy&s;a&s;ters and Inconveniences, which might again have a&s;&s;aulted the <HI>Bridge,</HI> were for the future prevented; for Sir <HI>Robert Knolles,</HI> a Per&s;on who had improved, and enhaun&s;ed his Fame, to the highe&s;t Degree of Eminence, by his glorious and &s;ucces|full Managery of the Engli&s;h Affairs, and Intere&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> &s;eeking to make him|&s;elf as u&s;efull to his Friends, that is, his Contrymen, as he was before con&s;iderable to his Enemies, ma&s;tered the Cour&s;e of the River, and &s;omewhat nearer to the Ca&s;tle as in a place more fit, both for the Soliditie, and fa&s;tne&s;&s;e of the Soile, as likewi&s;e for the breaking of the impetuou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Current, erected the Bridge of Stone which is now vi&s;ible, fixed, and e&s;tabli&s;hed on one and twenty Arches, and by this Victory over the Elements, made his Triumphs more illu&s;trious, than he had done before, by all the Conque&s;ts of his Adver&s;aries: for in the&s;e he only &s;eemed to have out-gone all others, but in this, to have outdone him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Being thus fixed and Strengthned, there was a Statute enacted in the one and twen|tieth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, wherein there is Provi&s;ion made for its future Securi|ty, there being &s;everal parcells of Land, which are mentioned in that Act, tied and obliged for its continual Maintenance and Repair, when&s;oever the Injuries of Time, or tho&s;e of the Elements, &s;hould deface or impair it.</P>

<P>The Chappel or Chantry in old Records, &s;tyled the Chantry of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> Bridge, was founded in the year 1399, by <HI>Iohn de Cobham,</HI> and was dedicated to the holy Trinity, and was called at the fir&s;t In&s;titution, <HI>All Souls</HI> Chappel, becau&s;e Prayers and other Orizons, were there to be offered up, for the Redemption and Health of all Chri&s;tian Souls, and likewi&s;e a Stipend or Exhibition was there &s;etled, for the Support and Maintenance of three Prie&s;ts, or Chaplains, particularly, to pray for the Souls of <HI>John de Cobham</HI> the Patron and Founder, Sir <HI>Robert Knolles,</HI> to whom the Bridge owed its primitive E&s;tabli&s;hment, <HI>William Wangford</HI> and <HI>Eleanor</HI> his Wife, <HI>Iohn Fre|mingham</HI> and <HI>Alice</HI> his Wife, <HI>William Makenade,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Rickhil;</HI> and likewi&s;e for the Souls of &s;ome who were decea&s;ed before the Foundation of this Chappel, as

<P>The Priory was founded by <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> and dedicated to the Honor of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and &s;tored with Monks who were to live under the Rule of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> though afterwards, as Mr. <HI>Lambert</HI> out of the Book of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> ob&s;erves, they altered their Rule, and conformed them&s;elves to the Canon of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hippo,</HI> but were reduced again to the primitive In&s;titution of St. <HI>Benedict,</HI> in the year 1080, by <HI>Gundulphus</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> in which De&s;ign, he was aided and &s;upported by <HI>Lanfranc</HI> the active Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> In Ages of an elder In&s;cription, there were &s;everal Conte&s;ts brake forth between the Monks of <HI>Chri&s;t-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and tho&s;e of this Covent; the fir&s;t Strugling, to bring the Election of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> into their Chapiter, which the la&s;t, Sticking clo&s;e to their own inherent Rights and Priviledges, endevoured to di&s;annul, and wholly to circum|&s;cribe his Election within the Precincts of their own Chapiter. Two Pre&s;idents, which repre&s;ent to Po&s;terity the whole State of this Controver&s;ie, do occur in Record. The fir&s;t appears in the year 1227, when after the Death of <HI>Benedict,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> elected to &s;ucceed him, <HI>Henry Sandford,</HI> a Man of exemplary Piety, &s;o that he was inculpable for his Life, and of unfathomed Learning, &s;o that he was in that Age, almo&s;t unparallelled for his Knowledge, which could not &s;tave off the Monks of <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> to ju&s;tle the Election, pretending that the pa&s;toral Staffe or Cro&s;ier of <HI>Roche&s;ter, de Jure,</HI> ought to have been brought to their Hou&s;e, after the Decea&s;e of the Bi&s;hop, and that the Election was to have been made in their Chapiter. This occa&s;ioned much Heat, for the Monks of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> vigorou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted their own Choice, &s;o that it was referred to the Deci&s;ion of the Arch|bi&s;hop, and he again put it over to the Umpirage of Delegates, who hearing the parties concerned, and poi&s;ing the Allegations, produced by either &s;ide to &s;u&s;tain the Ju&s;tice of their own Cau&s;e; they by a finall Determination, declared the Right to re&s;ide in the Monks of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> But it &s;eems this Fire, was only allayed, not extingui&s;hed: for in the year 1238, it brake forth again, and the occa&s;ion which gave Fuell to it, was this. The Monks of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> had elected <HI>Richard Wendover</HI> for their Bi&s;hop, which &s;o exa&s;perated and di&s;gu&s;ted the Monks of <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> that &s;u&s;pecting their own Power, they, more to inforce and mul|tiply their Strength, and evacuate that Election, entituled Arch-bi&s;hop <HI>Edmund</HI> to their Cau&s;e. But the Monks of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> di&s;claiming, by a tame Remi&s;&s;ene&s;&s;e, either to foment or palliate their own undoing, appealed to <HI>Rome,</HI> where af|ter the chargeable Commencement of a three years Sute, the Innocency and Ju&s;tice of their Cau&s;e was recompen&s;ed with the Triumph of the Day, upon which they returned home exalted with the Joy of their Succe&s;&s;e, and enacted in their Chapiter, that the annuall Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Cuthbert,</HI> on which Day they archie|ved this &s;ignal Conque&s;t, &s;hould be doubly &s;olemnized, both in their Church and in their Kitchin. But as they were &s;ucce&s;&s;efull in their rancounters with the Arch-bi&s;hop, &s;o they were very infortunate in that inte&s;tine Di&s;cord, which bur&s;t out between them, and their own Bi&s;hop <HI>Gilbert Glanville;</HI> who not only forcibly wrung from them their Goods, Ornaments, Writings, and other Muniments, but likewi&s;e deve&s;ted them of a con&s;iderable Portion of their Lands, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and Priviledges, which forced them to appeal to <HI>Rome</HI> for Redre&s;&s;e; where they em|broiled them&s;elves in a tedious Law-Sute, which engaged them to that va&s;t ex|pence, that they were con&s;trained to coin the Silver of <HI>Paulinus</HI> Shrine into Money, to &s;upport them in &s;o expen&s;ive and co&s;tly a Conte&s;t; and this much emba&s;ed for the fu|ture that E&s;teem which the World formerly had entertained both of the Piety and Sanctitie of the Monks of this Cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Conte&s;ts did not &s;o much prejudice or endamage this Cloi&s;ter within, though accompanied with much Heat, as the Deva&s;tation occa&s;ioned by the Ele|ment of Fire without: for in the year 1130. when <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, with a great Convention of the Nobility and Bi&s;hops was then pre&s;ent to &s;olemnize the Con&s;e|cration of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Cathedral and Church, which was then newly fini&s;hed, a
<PB N="290" REF="153">&s;uddain Flame broke out, who&s;e A&s;&s;aults upon this Covent, did much deface and empare the Glory of the Ancient Fabrick. And as if this impetuous Eruption had not been enough to dimini&s;h the Beauty of it, there was another Fire in the year 1177. which was about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, which exerci&s;ed its Fury upon it, even to a total Depopulation of this Cloi&s;ter; yet after all the&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters, wherein it is di&s;putable, whether the Rage of men, or that of the Elements, were more de&s;tructive, by the Charitable Beneficence and Piety of that Age, it aro&s;e like a Phaenix, more Beautiful and vigorous, even out of its Embers and A&s;hes, and continued in that condition, until the general Di&s;&s;olution, in the reign of <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the eighth, and then that Prince having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this Covent, and torn off their Revenue, upon their Ruines he e&s;tabli&s;hed a Dean and twelve Prebends, and endowed them for their future &s;upport with that Demea&s;ne, which for the princi|pal part of it, as namely, <HI>Wouldham, Halling, Snodland, Trotte&s;cliff, Denton, Longfeild, Bore&s;tal, Lid&s;ing,</HI> and <HI>Stoke,</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> had been formerly annexed to the above-mentioned Cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Cathedral, with the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> united to it, were founded and e&s;tabli&s;hed by that pious Monarch <HI>Ethelbert</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> and the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop to whom was entru&s;ted the Pa&s;toral Staffe or Cro&s;ier by <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> the Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> was <HI>Ju&s;tus,</HI> the above-mentioned Prince, not only a&s;&s;enting unto this Election by his Pre&s;ence, but likewi&s;e contributing to the Support of the Per&s;on &s;o cho&s;en, and his Succe&s;&s;ors by his liberal Beneficence. And indeed it is remarka|ble, that in all tho&s;e Revolutions and Vici&s;&s;itudes, which have rolled and varied the Fate of things and Affairs, &s;ince the Seeds of Chri&s;tianity were &s;own &s;o plenti|fully by the Hand of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> in this I&s;land, that the Chair of this Bi&s;hoprick was &s;till fixed at <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> whereas many others have in &s;undry parts of the Nation &s;uffered divers Tran&s;lations to other places then that where they at fir&s;t were e&s;ta|bli&s;hed; and the Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e by the Order of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, &s;uch Bi&s;hops as were before re&s;ident in Towns and Villages, were forthwith to tran&s;plant their Seat into walled Cities and places of Defence, the more to oblige the popu|lacie, not only to repair thither for the Exerci&s;e of Devotion, but likewi&s;e to augment the Commerce and Bulk of tho&s;e Cities, by &s;uch numerous A&s;&s;emblies; but in this Command of his, <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> could not be interre&s;&s;ed or concerned, that was inve&s;ted with a Wall, or &s;omething equivalent to it long before the Age of the Conqueror. I &s;hould now unfold a Catalogue of tho&s;e Bi&s;hops that &s;wayed the Cro|&s;ier of this Sea, beginning with <HI>Ju&s;tus,</HI> and concluding with <HI>John Warner</HI> the in|&s;tant Bi&s;hop of this Dioce&s;s; but this is &s;o obvious, both in <HI>Goodwin,</HI> and a late Manual, &s;tyled <HI>The Help to Hi&s;tory,</HI> that I &s;hall only hi&s;torically Record the mo&s;t eminent of them, and proceed. The fir&s;t of whom I find to be <HI>Ju&s;tus,</HI> who was tran&s;lated from this Sea, to that of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> a Man who&s;e Integrity of Life breathed out a noble perfume when he was living, and his Body, if we may credit the Fabulous and Super&s;titious Legend of that Age, no le&s;s grateful an Odour when he was Dead, for 'tis reported that his Reliques being to be removed after their En|terment many years before, ca&s;t forth (not the Stench or Steam of Putrefaction) but a Sent &s;o odorous and fragrant, that it did not annoy, but exceedingly delight the No&s;thrils of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent; but indeed this might be po&s;&s;ible without the Concurrence of a Miracle, if we con&s;ider that tho&s;e Remains of his might be re&s;cued from the Fate of Corruption, by the Adjuncts or Circum&s;tances of Nard, Balm, Spicery, and Perfume; &s;o that the Miracle &s;eems to be impo&s;ed by the Monks on the Laity of that Age, only to excite both their Devotion and Benevo|lence.</P>
<P><HI>Paulinus,</HI> who was the third Bi&s;hop, who &s;ucceeded him, converted <HI>Edwin</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Edelburga</HI> his Queen, to Chri&s;tianity, and &s;o ju&s;tly meri|ted the Title of Apo&s;tle of that Province, for which he was recorded after his Death in the Regi&s;ter of Saints, and had his Body &s;o far ennobled, that it was wrapt up in a &s;ilver Shrine.</P>
<P><HI>Ithamar,</HI> who next &s;ucceeded him, had his Reliques likewi&s;e en&s;hrined in after Times by <HI>Gandulphus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> which was not only repaired, but very much adorned and beautified by Bi&s;hop <HI>John</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, becau&s;e (as the Book of
<PB N="291" REF="153"><HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> intimates, he was redeemed, by touching his Reliques, <HI>ab acerrimo Oculo|rum Dolore,</HI> from &s;ome &s;harp Di&s;tillation which did afflict his Eye.</P>
<P><HI>Arno&s;tus</HI> was pre&s;ent at <HI>Pinenden-heath,</HI> at the great Debate touching &s;ome Lands, which were unju&s;tly ravi&s;hed away from the Church.</P>
<P><HI>Gundulphus</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or erected the white Tower in <HI>Roche&s;ter-ca&s;tle:</HI> and where|as he at his fir&s;t In&s;talment, found but &s;ix Canons in the Covent of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> he &s;o liberally endowed it, that he left it repleni&s;hed with three&s;core Monks of the Order and Rule of St. <HI>Benedict.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tobias,</HI> whom I &s;hould have mentioned after <HI>Ithamar,</HI> was (as <HI>Harp feild</HI> out of the <HI>Records</HI> of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>) a man very dextrous and skilful in the Tongues, and a gene|ral Magazine of all other Learning both Divine and Humane be&s;ide.</P>
<P><HI>Walter de Merton,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> did not only found the Colledge of <HI>Merton</HI> at <HI>Oxford,</HI> but likewi&s;e laid the Foundation of an imperfect Colledge at <HI>Maldon</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which by his Death was left unfini&s;hed. He died in the year 1277. and lies buried in his own Church at <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> to which in his Life Time he had been a Munificent Benefactor. In Gratitude to who&s;e Memory Sir <HI>Henry Savil,</HI> and the Fellows of <HI>Merton</HI> Colledge, erected a Magnificent Monument, in the year 1599. over his A&s;hes, which though it be much empaired both by Age, and the in|jurious Affronts of the&s;e impious Times; yet &s;hall the Name of this great man be the be&s;t Steward to his own Du&s;t: and when his Sepulchre it &s;elf &s;hall lie enterred in its own deplored Rubbi&s;h, this &s;hall &s;tand unto it &s;elf an everla&s;ting Tomb and Epitaph.</P>
<P><HI>Hamon de Heath</HI> was Confe&s;&s;or to <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and a liberal Benefactor to this Church; He built the Hou&s;e at the Mannor of <HI>Halling,</HI> which in &s;ome Ancient Records is &s;tyled his Pallace.</P>
<P><HI>Joannes de Scapeia,</HI> or <HI>John de Shepey</HI> was Lord Trea&s;urer of <HI>England</HI> three years.</P>
<P><HI>Richard Young</HI> was a principal Contributor to the Reparation of the Church at <HI>Frendsbury,</HI> and wholly glazed the Windows: where not long &s;ince his pourtracture was expo&s;ed to the publick View; a good Index, not only to his Memory, but like|wi&s;e to the Remembrance of &s;o pious a Work.</P>
<P><HI>John Lowe</HI> was born in the County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and was a man in the E&s;timate of <HI>Bale,</HI> who writ his Life, not only of &s;ignal Piety, but likewi&s;e an Exchequer of all manner of Learning.</P>
<P><HI>John Fi&s;her</HI> was a man of va&s;t Knowledge, which yet was Ruinous to him for a&s;|&s;erting the Papal Supremacy, when it was inve&s;ted in <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, by an Act of Parliament; he offered up his Life on a Scaffold, as a Sacrifice to that opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Nicolas Ridley</HI> was a man of an inculpable Life, and of a wide Knowledge, who was &s;o an irrefragable A&s;&s;ertor of the Prote&s;tant Religion, that he gave him&s;elf up at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to the Fury of Fire and Faggot for the Te&s;timony of what he before had profe&s;&s;ed: and hath by his exemplary Life and Death, taught the Adver&s;aries of Epi&s;copacy this Le&s;&s;on, that it is po&s;&s;ible that the Seed may be pure as well as the Soyl; that is, the per&s;ons of the Men, as well as the Office, may be incorrupt.</P>
<P><HI>John Warner</HI> is the la&s;t, who brings up this Catalogue, in whom the in&s;tant Title of this Bi&s;hoprick is re&s;ident, a man worthy of better Dayes, yet fit for the&s;e; who for his va&s;t Encouragement of Learning in the be&s;t of Times, and his pious Support of it in the wor&s;t, cannot be mentioned without an Attribute.</P>
<P>There have in elder Times many Conte&s;ts and Animo&s;ities broke out between the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> and the Fuel which fomented and &s;upplied this Fire of Contention, was, that both the&s;e Prelates pretended to the Support of the Cro&s;ier before the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in all Proce&s;&s;ions, and other Acts of publick and &s;ignal Solemnity; but in Fine, the Cro&s;ier or Pa&s;toral Staff was fixed or &s;etled in the Hand of the Prelate of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> and hath been by Pre&s;cription ever &s;ince united as a convicted and Inherent Priviledge to this Dioce&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Before I wave my Di&s;cour&s;e concerning this Bi&s;hoprick, I mu&s;t inform the Read|er, that there are &s;ome peculiars which are annexed to the Deanries of <HI>Croydon</HI> and <HI>Shorham,</HI> and this hath entangled and engaged many in much Difficulty to trace out the la&s;t Wils and Te&s;taments of tho&s;e who decea&s;ed within the Confines and Pre|cincts
<PB N="292" REF="154">of the&s;e peculiars. To unravel therefore the&s;e Niceties for the future; I &s;hall repre&s;ent a ju&s;t Scale of the&s;e excepted places, out of the original Records of the Church of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> them&s;elves, that tho&s;e which can find no &s;atisfaction in the Regi&s;ters of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> or Records of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> may yet di&s;cover what they are in pur&s;uit of, in that Office, wherein the&s;e are enrolled and filed. But before I unwind their Catalogue, I &s;hall in brief wrap up what in former Times hath been delivered touching the Office of Rural Deans, by <HI>Duarenus</HI> and others, who have more co|piou&s;ly dilated them&s;elves upon this Subject. This Officer was certainly brought into the Church to &s;upply the place of tho&s;e whom Antiquity &s;tyled the <HI>Chore-Epi&s;copi,</HI> who were commonly A&s;&s;i&s;tants to the Bi&s;hop: For indeed where the Dioce&s;&s;e was of that va&s;t Latitude and Extent, that the Managery of &s;o great a Tru&s;t was di&s;pro|portionate to the Di&s;charge of one &s;ingle Per&s;on, it was nece&s;&s;ary that his Care &s;hould be &s;upported by the mutual Coun&s;el and concurrent Advice of others, who&s;e prudence might improve the Affairs of the Church: and upon the going out of the above-mentioned Office, as being ob&s;olete and antiquated, this of the Rural Dean came in. And to him did the Bi&s;hop entru&s;t an In&s;pection into the Lives of the Clergy, and from him did receive an exact Account of Scandal in its whole Lati|tude, and other vitious Exce&s;&s;es, which might by an impious Connivance have ad|ded more blackne&s;s to the Ca&s;&s;ock: He was likewi&s;e, by Delegation from the Bi&s;hop, to take Cogni&s;ance of all Errors and Deviations from that which in that Age was re|puted Orthodox Doctrine, that neither the Foundation nor Super&s;tructure of Reli|gion might be a&s;&s;aulted. And la&s;tly, where the Dioce&s;&s;e was wide, and of a large Territory, it frequently hapned that the Probate and Admini&s;tration of &s;undry Te|&s;taments in divers places, was committed to his Care and Sway; and he was like|wi&s;e entru&s;ted with a Seal, with the Name of the Bi&s;hop, who&s;e Office by Depu|tation he was to di&s;charge, and not his own, in&s;culped upon it: which upon his Decea&s;e, or relinqui&s;hing this Office, was to be &s;urrendered up into the Hands of the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;&s;e for the Time being, that he might di&s;po&s;e of it as he &s;hould judge convenient. Thus much of the Rurall Dean: the Peculiars of which I before promi&s;ed a Catalogue, are as follow:

<P>Having done with the Church, I &s;hall now de&s;cend to tho&s;e Mannors which lie circum&s;cribed within the Precincts and Verge of this City. The fir&s;t is <HI>Bore&s;tall,</HI> which, as <HI>Textus Roffen&s;is</HI> denotes and &s;ignifies unto us, was given to the Church and Monks of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> by <HI>Kenulfus</HI> King of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and was, as the Records of that Church te&s;tifie, <HI>de Cibo eorum,</HI> to &s;upport their Table with a con&s;tant &s;upply of Diet, and re&s;ted annexed to their Demea&s;ne, until the Fatality of the General Di&s;&s;olution ravi&s;hed it away, and afterwards it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, when he e&s;tabli&s;hed a Dean and Chapiter upon the Ruines of this above-mentioned Priory, linked unto that Revenue, which he granted them for their future &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is <HI>Great Delce,</HI> which had owners of that Sirname, as is evident by <HI>Te&s;ta de Nevill,</HI> and other Records both of a publick and private Stamp; but, it appears, was not of any permanent continuance in this Name: for before the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, it was gon from that, and united to the Inheritance of <HI>Ha&s;|pall.
<PB N="293" REF="154">Geffrey de Ha&s;pall,</HI> enjoyed it at his Death under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, as appears by an Inqui&s;ition, taken in the fifteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 25. The next Family in Succe&s;&s;ion after this, which was entitu|led to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (as is evident by the original Deeds, now in the Hands of <HI>Lea</HI>) was <HI>Molineux,</HI> derived from tho&s;e of <HI>Sefton</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> but he remained &s;o incon|&s;iderable a Space in the Inheritance, that like <HI>Cato</HI> in the <HI>Theater,</HI> he only &s;tept into it, that he might go out again; for about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the te&s;timony of an ancient Court-roll, <HI>Benedict de Ful&s;ham,</HI> was inve&s;ted in the Patrimony of it in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 20. And from him, did it &s;treame down in the Channel of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Intere&s;t, to his De&s;|cendant <HI>Richard Ful&s;ham,</HI> who likewi&s;e was in the Enjoyment of it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Rot E&s;c. Num.</HI> 17. But after his <HI>Exit,</HI> I find no farther mention of any of this Family, to have been po&s;&s;e&s;t of this place; for, in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Reginald Love,</HI> died &s;ei&s;ed of it, and tran&s;mitted it to his Succe&s;&s;or, who held it untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and then the Revolution of Purcha&s;e, brought it to be the Demea&s;ne of <HI>William Venour,</HI> and it was found to be his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion at his Death, which was in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 24. But after his Depar|ture, the Title was very un&s;etled and incon&s;tant; for within the Circle of &s;ome Moneths after, it was by Sale from this Name, rolled into the Tenure of <HI>Markham</HI> de&s;cended from the ancient Stem of the <HI>Markhams,</HI> of <HI>Nottingham-&s;hire,</HI> where after a very tran&s;itory aboad, it was by the &s;ame Fatality, carried into the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tate;</HI> who about the fir&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, pa&s;&s;ed it away to Sir <HI>Richard Lea,</HI> Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> de&s;cended from an ancient Family of that Name, in the County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and his Son was Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the nineteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and held his Shrievalty at his new acqui|red Mannor of <HI>Much Delce,</HI> and from him by an even thread of De&s;cent, has the Title and Propriety been conducted down to <HI>Richard Lea</HI> E&s;quire, who is the in&s;tant Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Hor&s;ted</HI> borrows its Name from <HI>Hor&s;a,</HI> Brother to <HI>Hengi&s;t</HI> the Founder of the <HI>Sax|on Kingdome</HI> here in <HI>Kent,</HI> who fell by the Sword of the Britons at <HI>Alresford,</HI> as an expiatory Sacrifice, to ballance the Lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Cartigerne,</HI> Brother to <HI>Vortimer,</HI> General of the Confederate Briti&s;h Forces, who was offered up in that &s;ignal Encounter, as an <HI>Holocau&s;t</HI> to the Saxon Fury; and there is &s;omething, which even at this Day, lies wrapt up in the Name, that induces us to believe, that <HI>Hor&s;a</HI> after his &s;laugh|ter, recieved the Rites of his Funeral at this place; and in our Grandfathers Me|mory, there were the &s;cattered Remains of diver&s;e huge Ma&s;&s;ie Stones, which Storms and other Impre&s;&s;ions of Time, have now altogether demoli&s;hed: and the&s;e certainly were, in elder Times, compo&s;ed into the Figure of a Monument, to &s;hroud the A&s;hes of this <HI>Hor&s;a;</HI> as tho&s;e at <HI>Cits Cothou&s;e,</HI> above <HI>Alresford,</HI> were framed in|to the &s;ame Proportionate Mould, to &s;ecure the Du&s;t, or at lea&s;t to point out to Po&s;terity the Memory of <HI>Cartigern.</HI></P>
<P>The Mannor it &s;elf, was enwraped in the Patrimony of the noble and ancient Fa|mily of <HI>Apulderfield. William de Apulderfield,</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Lands at <HI>Hor&s;ted,</HI> in the thirty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth. In Times of a lower De&s;cent, I di&s;cover it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Warren;</HI> for <HI>John,</HI> Son of <HI>Edmund Warren,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. After <HI>Warren</HI> had quitted the Inheritance, I find the <HI>Ful&s;hams</HI> by Purcha&s;e to be en|tituled to the Fee-&s;imple of it; and <HI>Benedict de Ful&s;ham,</HI> enjoyed in at his Decea&s;e, which was in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and paid relief for this and <HI>Much Delce,</HI> under the Notion of the fourth part of a Knights Fee, at making the Black Prince Knight, in the twentieth year of the above-&s;aid Prince. After this Family was worn out, it had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the &s;ame Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with <HI>Much Delce,</HI> &s;o that it came with that Mannor by Purcha&s;e from <HI>Tate,</HI> to Sir <HI>Richard Lea</HI> Knight; and from him is the Title by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive De&s;cent, tran&s;ported to <HI>Rtchard Lea</HI> E&s;quire, the pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><HI>Snodher&s;t</HI> is another Mannor which lies partly &s;pread into <HI>Chetham,</HI> and partly into the Limits of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> was, as high as I can trace any Record, a Branch of that
<PB N="294" REF="155">Demea&s;n, which fell under the Dominion of <HI>Badele&s;mer,</HI> and though <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Bade~le&s;mer,</HI> had by his perfidious Di&s;loyalty, forfeited it in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd; yet was it in the &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, re&s;tored to his Son <HI>Bartholomew Badele&s;mer,</HI> who in the twelfth year of that Prince, dyed without I&s;&s;ue, and left it to his Brother <HI>Giles Badele&s;mer,</HI> who likewi&s;e decea&s;ing without I&s;&s;ue; Sir <HI>John Tiptoft,</HI> in Right of <HI>Margery</HI> his Wife, one of his Si&s;ters and Coheirs, entered upon the Inheritance of it: but, before the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, had alienated it to <HI>Benedict de Ful&s;ham,</HI> for he in that year, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aid,</HI> paid re&s;pective relief for it, at the making the Black Prince Knight, After <HI>Ful&s;hams</HI> were extingui&s;hed at this place, it had the Fate to own the Juri&s;diction and Intere&s;t of tho&s;e, who were the Succe&s;&s;ive Proprietaries of <HI>Much Delce,</HI> &s;o that it is now knit to the pre&s;ent Inheritance of <HI>Richard Lea</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P><HI>Little Delce</HI> is the la&s;t Mannor which is circum&s;cribed within the Precincts of this City. It was, in Ages of a very high Calculation, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the no|ble, illu&s;trious, and ancient Family of <HI>Sherington,</HI> written in old Deeds, Pipe|rolls, and other Evidences, <HI>Serington,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Scherington,</HI> but mo&s;t fre|quently <HI>Sherington:</HI> who&s;e original and principal Seat, was at <HI>Sherington-hall</HI> at <HI>Cranworth</HI> in <HI>Norfolk,</HI> though they had other Mannors, which bore their Name, which anciently were folded up in their Demea&s;ne, as namely <HI>Sherington</HI> in the County of <HI>Buckingham, Sherington</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex, Sherington</HI> in the County of <HI>Here|ford,</HI> and <HI>Sherington</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> yet, as I take it, in their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But to proceed, <HI>Odo de Serington,</HI> or <HI>Sherington,</HI> for the Names are <HI>Synonyma</HI> or coinci|dent, held this Mannor in the thirty fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, and was enter|red in the Cathedral of <HI>Roche&s;ter;</HI> and when <HI>Robert Glover Somer&s;et Herald,</HI> col|lected his <HI>Mi&s;cellany</HI> of Church-notes, in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> there were &s;ome Reliques of his Monument, offered up to the Survey of a curious and Inqui&s;itive Eye, which now the Sacrilegious Barbarity of impious Mechanicks, and the injurious Hand of Time together, have wholly di&s;mantled. After <HI>She|rington</HI> was worn out, I find a Family, called <HI>Pugeis,</HI> inve&s;ted in the Inhe|ritance, and there is mention in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, in <HI>Kirkbies Inque&s;t</HI> (a Book kept in the Exchequet,) of one <HI>Richard Pugeis</HI> who then held it: but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family had de&s;erted the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and tran&s;mitted his Concernment in it by Sale to <HI>Richard Charles,</HI> and he enjoyed it at his Decea&s;e, which was in the fifth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num</HI> 92. And &s;o did <HI>Nicholas Charles</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, in the eleventh year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 16. And <HI>Robert</HI> was his Son and Heir, who dying without I&s;&s;ue, it was united to the Demea&s;ne of <HI>Richard Ormes|kirk,</HI> in right of <HI>Joan,</HI> Si&s;ter and Heir of the above-mentioned <HI>Robert;</HI> and he in the third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>Henry Perey,</HI> Earl of <HI>Northum|berland;</HI> and he not long after, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Rickhull,</HI> in which Family it re&s;ted, untill the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and then it was by Deed conveyed from <HI>William Rickhull</HI> E&s;quire, to <HI>Thomas Glover,</HI> and <HI>Henry Hunt,</HI> who had then the Cu&s;tody or Guardian&s;hip of <HI>Roche&s;ter-Bridge,</HI> and to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Wardens of it, towards the Pre&s;ervation and Reparation of its Fabrick for ever; &s;o that at this in&s;tant, it is parcel of that Revenue, which re&s;cues this noble Structure from Decay and Ruin.</P>
<P><HI>Na&s;henden</HI> next offers it &s;elf up to our Remembrance. In the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, I find it entituled to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Family called <HI>A&s;pall,</HI> and in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John A&s;pall,</HI> paid re&s;pective Aid, at making the Black Prince Knight.

<P>From hence branched forth the <HI>Brockhills,</HI> or <HI>Brockhulls</HI> (for anciently they were written &s;o, both ways) both of <HI>Cale-hill,</HI> and <HI>Aldington Septuans</HI> in <HI>Thurnham:</HI> But the Male Line fayling here in <HI>Thomas Brockhull, Elizabeth</HI> his Sole Daughter and Heir, brought it to be po&s;&s;e&s;t by <HI>Richard Selling,</HI> in which Family, after the Intere&s;t of it, &s;tay|ed untill allmo&s;t our Fathers Remembrance, it was by the &s;ame Devolution, carried off to acknowledge the Propriety of <HI>Tournay.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sandhur&s;t</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Selbrittenden,</HI> was, with much other Land granted by King <HI>Offa,</HI> in the year 791, to <HI>Chri&s;t-church</HI> in <HI>Canterbury.</HI> But <HI>Betherinden</HI> was always of temporal Intere&s;t; for it afforded both Seat and Sirname, to a Fa|mily of this Denomination, and <HI>John de Bethrinden,</HI> dyed &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: But not long, after, did it re&s;ide in this Family; for this Name expired in a Female Inheritrix, who was matched to <HI>Finch,</HI> who united this Seat to his Demea&s;ne; and here it lay untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> and then it was rent off by Sale, and placed in <HI>Pelham;</HI> and from this Name a Mutation of the &s;ame Circum&s;tance, took it away; and, in our Fathers Remembrance annexed it to the Inheritance of <HI>Fowl,</HI> and remains &s;till with the De&s;|cendants of that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Aldrinden</HI> is a third place of Account in <HI>Sandhur&s;t,</HI> had Owners of that Sirname: of whom <HI>Roger de Aldrinden,</HI> as the private Deeds of this place do inform me, was the la&s;t in the Male de&s;cent, who left it to his Daughter and Heir <HI>Chri&s;tian Aldrin|den;</HI> and &s;he in the twenty &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>John Sellbrittenden;</HI> who not long after, alienated it to <HI>Thomas Bourne,</HI> and he held it as appears by an old Court-roll, in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd; and from him did it by the Chain of De&s;cent, pa&s;&s;e along, untill it arrived at <HI>John Bourn,</HI> who dying in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, &s;ettled it by Will, on <HI>Joan</HI> his Female Inheritrix, matched to <HI>Thomas Allard,</HI> and by this Alliance, did it de&s;cend to his Son <HI>Henry Allard,</HI> who had I&s;&s;ue <HI>John Allard;</HI> who alienated his Right in it by Sale, to <HI>John Twi&s;den</HI> Gentleman, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; from whom it came down to his Succe&s;&s;or Mr. <HI>William Twi&s;den;</HI> who about the Beginning of King <HI>James,</HI> &s;old it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Downton</HI> E&s;quire, Father of Mr. <HI>Richard Downton</HI> of <HI>I&s;tleworth</HI> E&s;quire, Ju&s;tice of the Peace for the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Combden</HI> is another Mannor in this Pari&s;h, which was anciently po&s;&s;e&s;t by <HI>Fulk de Ballard;</HI> that <HI>Fulk,</HI> who, as appears by the Book called <HI>Te&s;ta de Nevill,</HI> in the Ex|chequer, paid a re&s;pective &s;upply for Land in <HI>Sandhur&s;t,</HI> at the marriage of <HI>I&s;abell</HI> Si&s;ter to King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the twentieth year of that Prince: but not long did the Propriety of this place, re&s;t in this Family; for in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the
<PB N="300" REF="158">&s;econd, I find it in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Whitfields,</HI> an ancient Family, de&s;cended from <HI>Whitfield</HI> in <HI>Cumberland,</HI> of which Stock was Sir <HI>Ithan de Whitfield,</HI> who in behalf of the Barons, then knit together in an ho&s;tile confederacy again&s;t their Prince, (as an old <HI>French</HI> Manu&s;cript informs me) <HI>tue Borough-bridge</HI> 15. <HI>Edwardi &s;ecundi, il e&s;t oit contre le Roy,</HI> defended <HI>Borough-bridge</HI> again&s;t <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd.

<P>Here is a place in this Pari&s;h, which, however it be now under a cloudy and ob|&s;cure Character, was in Ages of a higher Gradation, the Inheritance of the Noble Family of <HI>Twi&s;den:</HI> and certainly here they lived, when they writ, <HI>de Denna Fracta,</HI> and from them it hath borrowed the Title of <HI>Twi&s;den-&s;treet</HI> or <HI>Borough,</HI> which it re|tains to this Day. Indeed <HI>Twi&s;den</HI> in the Original <HI>Saxon,</HI> imports no more but the broken Valley, or the Vale di&s;tingui&s;hed into two peeces,</P>
<P><HI>Shadockher&s;t</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Blackborn, Chart, Longbridge</HI> and <HI>Ham,</HI> was the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>For&s;tall,</HI> and &s;ometimes written <HI>at For&s;tall,</HI> which were of no contemptible Extraction in this County; for in &s;everal Ancient Deeds, I find <HI>John at For&s;tall,</HI> and <HI>Richard at For&s;tall</HI> to be Witne&s;&s;es, and it is probable they were Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this Mannor, though the private Deeds reach out to our View, no higher di&s;covery then the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth; for in the third year of that Prince's reign, <HI>Joan For&s;tall</HI> pa&s;&s;es it away by Deed to <HI>Stokys,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Stokes,</HI> and in that Family was the Intere&s;t of it many years cla&s;ped up, until at la&s;t the or|dinary Vici&s;&s;itude of Purcha&s;e brought it to be the Demea&s;ne of <HI>Randolph,</HI> who had an E&s;tate likewi&s;e about <HI>Burham</HI> near <HI>Maid&s;tone.</HI> And from this Name, about the beginning of King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, it went away by Sale to Sir <HI>John Taylor,</HI> who in the twenty fifth of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>John Taylor</HI> E&s;quire, Ance&s;tor to <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> E&s;quire, who is now inve&s;ted in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and from whom I confe&s;&s;e I have received my Intelligence concerning tho&s;e who were the former Proprietaries of it.</P>
<P><HI>Criols-court</HI> in this Pari&s;h was one of tho&s;e Seats which related to the Patrimony of <HI>Bertram de Crioll,</HI> and he died &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and left it to his Son <HI>John de Crioll,</HI> who decea&s;ing about the beginning of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the third without I&s;&s;ue, it devolved to <HI>Joan</HI> his Si&s;ter and Heir, who was matched to Sir <HI>Richard de Roke&s;ley:</HI> but he likewi&s;e determined in <HI>Agnes Roke&s;ley,</HI> who was one of his two Female Co-heirs, and &s;he by matching with <HI>Thomas de Poynings</HI> entituled that Family to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that wide E&s;tate, which devol|ved to her in Right of her Mother, and from him did it de&s;cend to his Succe&s;&s;or Sir <HI>Edward Poynings,</HI> Son of <HI>Robert Poynings,</HI> a man very eminent in the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh. For this Sir <HI>Edward,</HI> in the fir&s;t year of his Rule, immedi|atly after he had triumphed over <HI>Richard</HI> the third in <HI>Bo&s;worth-field,</HI> was cho&s;en one of his Privy Councel to manage the publick Intere&s;t of the Nation: Afterwards he mo&s;t vigoru&s;ly oppo&s;ed <HI>James</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> and his <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Squadrons being then in Defection to <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, in the tenth year of his reign. And this Sir <HI>Edward</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, though his Office was not found until the fourteenth of that Prince, and then it being di&s;cove|red that the whole Stock and Lineage of this Family were extingui&s;hed, and that there were none who were legally begotten (for Sir <HI>Thomas Poynings</HI> was his natural Son) that either in a direct or collateral Line, could pretend a Title to his E&s;tate, it e&s;cheated to the Crown. And <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth afterwards pa&s;&s;ed it away by Grant to <HI>William Taylor,</HI> who&s;e Sutce&s;&s;or Mr. <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>George Taylor,</HI> and he had I&s;&s;ue Mr. <HI>John Taylor,</HI> who concluding in <HI>Anne</HI> his Sole Daugh|ter and Heir, &s;he by a Match with <HI>Whitfeild,</HI> annexed it to the Demea&s;ne of that Name, from whom again, not many years &s;ince, it came over by Sale to <HI>More,</HI> who very lately hath alienated it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Taylor</HI> E&s;quire.</P>

Swords in their Hands, then like Slaves to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to the In&s;olence of the Con|querour, by a cheap and tame Submi&s;&s;ion with Halters about their Necks: which had &s;o great an Influence and Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Spirits, that they re&s;olved their Fran|chi&s;es and them&s;elves &s;hould find one Tomb together, rather then they would give up both, to the Sword and Will of an imperious Victor; and indeed &s;oon after they ma|naged their Stratagems with that Succe&s;&s;e, that <HI>William</HI> Sirnamed the Conquerour, advancing with his <HI>Normans</HI> into <HI>Kent,</HI> to reduce <HI>Dover-Ca&s;tle,</HI> which was then made good again&s;t him, he and his Army dropped into tho&s;e Ambu&s;hes, which the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Inhabitants had &s;trewed for him, where he had indi&s;putably peri&s;hed, had he not by Charter fortified and confirmed tho&s;e Immunities, they then contended and &s;trug|led for, and which remain unviolated either by any forrain or dome&s;tick Eruption even untill this Day.</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Swan&s;camp</HI> it &s;elf, was, as farre as Record can guide us to di&s;co|ver, the Inheritance of the <HI>Montchen&s;ies,</HI> called in the Latine, Repertory <HI>de Monte-Cani&s;io:</HI> and <HI>Hubert de Montchen&s;ey</HI> (as appears by <HI>Doom&s;-day</HI> Book) was the fir&s;t of that Name of any Eminence, who was Lord of the Fee; and after him his Son <HI>William de Montchen&s;ey,</HI> by paternal Right held it, and &s;o dyed in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, in the year 1287; from whom it de&s;cended to <HI>Dionis</HI> his Daughter and Heir, and in Re|lation to her, to her Husband, <HI>Hugh de Vere,</HI> who became by this Addition of E&s;tate, thus accruing, Baron of <HI>Swan&s;camp,</HI> and &s;at, under that Notion, in the Parlia|ment, which was &s;ummoned in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd: but he dying without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>William de Valence</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> claimed it in Right of his Wife, Daughter and Heir to <HI>John de Montchen&s;ey,</HI> &s;econd Brother to <HI>William de Montchen&s;ey</HI> who was Father in Law to <HI>Hugh de Vere</HI> above-mentioned; from whom it de&s;cended to his Son <HI>Aymer de Valence,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, in the &s;eventeenth year of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the third, <HI>I&s;abell</HI> his Si&s;ter matched to <HI>Lawrence de Ha&s;tings,</HI> became his Heir, who in her Right was Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and Baron of <HI>Swan&s;camp;</HI> and left it to his Grandchild <HI>John de Ha&s;tings,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue, in the four|teenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd; in the fifteenth year of that Prince, <HI>Reginald Grey,</HI> and <HI>Richard Talbot</HI> in re&s;pect of Marriage, were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Partition of the E&s;tate, this was united to the Demea&s;ne of <HI>Talbot,</HI> in which Family, after it had re&s;ted untill the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, it was conveyed to Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Bechworth</HI> Ca&s;tle, who&s;e Son Sir <HI>William Brown,</HI> in the twelfth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, &s;urrendered them into the hands of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, for the u&s;e of his Mother <HI>Cicely</HI> Dutche&s;&s;e Dowager of <HI>York,</HI> upon who&s;e Decea&s;e it returned to the Crown, and lay there untill the fir&s;t year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was granted to <HI>Ralph Weldon</HI> Esq; great Grand-father to Colonel <HI>Ralph Weldon</HI> the in|&s;tant Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Alcharden alias Combes</HI> is another place in this Pari&s;h, worthy this Survey. It was, many Hundred years &s;ince, the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Cumbe</HI> or <HI>Combe,</HI> who continued re&s;ident in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, untill the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and then it went away from them, by Sale to <HI>Swan</HI> of <HI>Hook</HI>-Hou&s;e in <HI>Southfleet,</HI> in which Family it was fixed, untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was convey|ed to <HI>Lovelace,</HI> who not long after, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Carter,</HI> and he alienated it to
<PB N="308" REF="162"><HI>Hardres,</HI> from whom, about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> the Vici&s;&s;itude of Sale carried it off to <HI>Fagge,</HI> who in the tenth year of King <HI>James,</HI> tran&s;mitted it by Sale to <HI>Hud&s;on,</HI> who&s;e De&s;cendant not many years fince, demi&s;ed it by Sale to Mr. <HI>Richard Head</HI> of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ince-Grice</HI> is the la&s;t place con&s;iderable in <HI>Swan&s;campe.</HI> It related before the gene|ral &s;uppre&s;&s;ion to the Priory of <HI>Dartford:</HI> but being torn off by King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, it was by <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, in the fifth of his reign, granted in Fee-Farm to <HI>Martin Muriell:</HI> but the Fee-&s;imple remained in the Crown, until Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the fifth year of her Rule, pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Edward Darbi&s;hire</HI> and <HI>John Bere,</HI> who not long after jointly conveyed it to <HI>Jones,</HI> who in our Fathers Memory alienated it to <HI>Holloway,</HI> who&s;e Son and Heir Mr. <HI>Thomas Holloway</HI> hath lately demi&s;ed his Intere&s;t in it to Captain <HI>Edward Brent</HI> of <HI>Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Staple</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Ea&s;try,</HI> hath two places memorable: Fir&s;t, <HI>Crixall</HI> which was Anciently written <HI>Crickleadd&s;hall,</HI> when in Ages of a higher A&s;cent it confe&s;&s;ed the Family of <HI>Brockhull</HI> for its Owners, which were Lords of it but until the twenty eighth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and then it was &s;etled upon a Daughter: but whether &s;he brought it or not by Marriage to <HI>Wadham,</HI> which Family I find about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to have been po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, I cannot di&s;cover; and where the Light of Record is dim, I mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in &s;ilence. <HI>William Wadhaem,</HI> as I trace out by an old Pedigree of <HI>Fogg,</HI> lived in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, under the Scepter of which Princes he managed the Office of Ju&s;tice of the Peace for the County of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and left his E&s;tate here to his Son and Heir Sir <HI>Nicholas Wadham,</HI> who determined in a Daughter and Heir, match|ed to Sir <HI>William Fogg,</HI> by which Alliance this Mannor came to be ingrafted into the Inheritance of that Family, and re&s;ted there until the fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale from Sir <HI>John Fogg</HI> Knight, to <HI>Ralph Bani&s;ter.</HI> In Times of a lower De&s;cent, that is, about the beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> I find it by Court-rols po&s;&s;e&s;t by <HI>Tucker,</HI> who about the latter end of that Prince&s;s alienated his Concernment in it to <HI>Smith,</HI> who in our Fathers Remembrance tran&s;|planted the Title by Sale into Doctour <HI>Fotherbie</HI> Dean of <HI>Cantorbury,</HI> who&s;e Son Mr. <HI>Charles Fotherbie</HI> continues now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Grove-place</HI> offers it &s;elf up to our Notice, as being the Habitation of a Knightly Family, called <HI>Grove,</HI> who in old Deeds are &s;ometimes written, at-<HI>Grove,</HI> and &s;ealed, as appears by the <HI>Labells</HI>-affixed to their Evidences, with <HI>three E&s;collops upon a Cheveron:</HI> In the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, I find it devolved by De&s;cent to Sir <HI>John Grove,</HI> who was a great Benefactor to the Church of St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Sandwich,</HI> where he lies buried with the Arms above-mentioned upon his Shield: but not long after, this Family determined in a Daughter and Heir, who linked this Seat to the Inheritance of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, con|veyed it to <HI>Quilter,</HI> in which Name it was re&s;ident, until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Linch,</HI> and hath remained ever &s;ince in|corporated into the Revenue of that Family: &s;o that at pre&s;ent it is come down to Mr. <HI>John Linch,</HI> a Noble Confe&s;&s;or for the Intere&s;t of the Church, and Prote&s;tant Religion.</P>
<P>There is a Family in this Pari&s;h called <HI>Omer,</HI> which as appears by old Court-rols, Tombs, Deeds, and other Evidences, have been con&s;tantly re&s;ident almo&s;t four Hundred years.</P>
<P><HI>Sea&s;alter</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Whit&s;taple,</HI> did belong to the Priory of <HI>Chri&s;t-church:</HI> but by whom it was given, the Records of that Covent are &s;ilent: only I find that it was part of that Revenue which &s;upported their Diet and Table, and likewi&s;e I di&s;cover that Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the ninth, in the tenth year of his Papacy, by his Bull appropriated the Par&s;onage to the Priory above-mentioned, and likewi&s;e was granted for the better improving their Lively-hood and Sub&s;i&s;tence. If you will &s;ee under what Notion it pa&s;&s;ed, in the twentieth year of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, <HI>Doome&s;day</HI> Book will inform you, that it was valued upon the Terrier at two Carucats of Land, and upon the Apprai&s;ment was rated at five pound.

<PB N="309" REF="162">of that E&s;tate, which related to the Convent above&s;aid, into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, was &s;etled by that Prince on the newly erected Dean and Chapi|ter of <HI>Chri&s;t-church,</HI> and there it remained, until the&s;e calamitous Times.</P>
<P><HI>Ellenden</HI> in this Pari&s;h belonged to the Abby of <HI>Fever&s;ham,</HI> and was (as the Lieger Book of that Covent informs me) given to the Monks of that Cloi&s;ter by <HI>John Ellen|den,</HI> and here it was incorporated and fixed, until the publick Di&s;&s;olution unhinged, and unrooted it, and planted it in the Crown: and afterwards King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty fifth year of his Government granted it to Mr. <HI>Thomas Arden,</HI> mi&s;era|bly afterwards a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by his Wife at <HI>Fever&s;ham;</HI> and he the &s;ame year conveyed it to <HI>John Nedeham,</HI> from whom it came over to his Son and Heir <HI>John Nedeham</HI> Gentleman, and he in the thirty &s;econd year of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> alienated it to Mr. <HI>Michael Beresford</HI> of <HI>We&s;terham,</HI> who not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to Sir <HI>George Newman</HI> Doctour of the Civil Law, and Knighted in the &s;ixteenth year of King <HI>James:</HI> and from him by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Right, it is now de&s;cended to his Son and Heir <HI>George Newman</HI> of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> E&s;quire.</P>

<P><HI>Hollands</HI> in this Pari&s;h next cals for a View: It was, in Ages of a very high Date, the Patrimony of a Noble Family of that Sirname, and are in the Chartularies of this Pari&s;h, recorded to have been great Benefactors to the Church of <HI>Spelher&s;t,</HI> and were allied to <HI>Thomas Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> who matched with <HI>Joan</HI> Daughter of <HI>Edmund</HI> of <HI>VVood&s;tock:</HI> but, before the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, this Family was worn out, and vani&s;hed, and then the <HI>VVallers</HI> &s;tepped into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in which Family the Right of it did many years re&s;ide, until it was in our Fathers Memory alie|nated to <HI>Thomas Sackville</HI> Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> from who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or it pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale to <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> and from him, not many years &s;ince, the like Revolution carried it off to <HI>Caldicot.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ferbies</HI> is another Seat of no vulgar Con&s;ideration in <HI>Spelher&s;t,</HI> if we con&s;ider that it gave Sirname to a Family of important Account in this Track, who had their ancient Re&s;idence at this place, and &s;ealed as high as <HI>Edward</HI> the third, with a <HI>Fe&s;&s;e Ermin between three Goats heads era&s;ed, in Labells affixed to their Deeds,</HI> which was the Paternal Coat-Armour of <HI>John de Fereby</HI> (for &s;o is the Name written in ancient Muniments) who flouri&s;hed, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and <HI>Edward</HI> the third.

<P><HI>Ewher&s;t</HI> is the la&s;t place which mu&s;t be mentioned, and indeed it is worth our Re|cording, becau&s;e this and <HI>Read</HI> in <HI>Marden,</HI> was the ancient Patrimony of <HI>Read,</HI> many Di&s;cents before.

<P><HI>Upton-court</HI> is a &s;econd place of Repute.

<P><HI>Swink-field</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Folkstone,</HI> was originally, and as high as any Evidence will leave us any Track or Print to walk by to a Di&s;covery, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the noble Family of <HI>Crioll,</HI> who held here two little Manors called <HI>Bouington alias Bointon,</HI> and <HI>Northcourt,</HI> which were both given by <HI>Nicholas Keriell</HI> or <HI>Crioll,</HI> in the third year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, to one <HI>John Phineux</HI> E&s;quire, for that Protection and Shelter, which he by a Magnanimous and vigorous A&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;upplied him with, even to the &s;aving of his Life, at the Battle of <HI>Polcteirs,</HI> and being thus fa&s;tned to this Family, the Intere&s;t of both the&s;e places, continued intermingled with their Inheritance, untill they came, by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Di&s;cent, to be po&s;&s;e&s;t by <HI>John Phineux</HI> E&s;quire, extracted from a Son by a &s;econd Wife of Sir <HI>Jo.

<P>There was a Praeceptory here at <HI>Swingfield,</HI> which belonged to the Knights Ho&s;pital|lers, of the Nature, Capacity, and Condition of which I have &s;poken before at <HI>Little-Peckham,</HI> which upon the Suppre&s;&s;ion of their Order here in <HI>England,</HI> was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the thirty third of his reign, granted to Sir <HI>Anthony Aucher;</HI> who not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Palmer,</HI> de&s;cended from an ancient Family of that Sirname in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> &s;o that it is now the Inheritance of Sir <HI>Henry Palmer</HI> of <HI>Wing|ham</HI> Baronet.</P>
<P>In the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>John Monins</HI> held Land here, and paid re&s;pective Aid for it, as the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> informs me, at making the Black Prince Knight.

<P>The Mannor of <HI>Cotton</HI> is embraced within the Precincts of <HI>Stone</HI> likewi&s;e: It was, as high as any private or publick Record can conduct us on to a Di&s;covery, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Killingworth</HI> of <HI>Hackstaple,</HI> at <HI>Sutton at Hone,</HI> and in this Family was the Title by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Derivation of &s;everal De&s;cents pre&s;erved, until the entrance of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was conveyed by <HI>George Killingworth</HI> E&s;quire, to Sir <HI>Richard Wilt&s;hire;</HI> from which Family not long after, the Propriety of this place was, by a Fate proportionate to this, planted in <HI>Apylton,</HI> Ance&s;tor to Sir <HI>Henry Apylton</HI> Knight and Baronet, now Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Stoke</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Hoo,</HI> was given to the Priory of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> by <HI>Eadbert</HI> K. of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the year 762. And upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion being &s;urrendred to the Crown, it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth &s;etled on his newly erected Dean and Cha|piter of <HI>Roche&s;ter.</HI> But here are two places which are of &s;ecular Intere&s;t. The fir&s;t is <HI>Malmains,</HI> which yielded both Seat and Sirname to a Family which fell under that Denomination; for I find <HI>John de Malmains</HI> Son of <HI>Henry</HI> died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, in the tenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and in this Family it remained until the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Iden,</HI> a Family of generous Rank in elder Times about <HI>Rolvenden,</HI> and here it lay couched in the Demea&s;n of this Family until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Jo.

Tuders</HI> is the &s;econd, which anciently confe&s;&s;ed a Family of that Appellation to be its original Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who&s;e Name was in all probability primitively <HI>Theodore;</HI> for I have &s;een an ancient Roll of <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Arms, wherein <HI>Tuder</HI> of <HI>Stoke</HI> bears the &s;ame Coat with <HI>Owen Theodore</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Tuder, viz. Azure a Cheveron between three Helmets Argent:</HI> But to proceed: When this Family di&s;lodged from this place, for want of Intelligence I con|fe&s;s I know not, onely in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth I find it po&s;&s;e&s;t by <HI>Woodward,</HI> in which Family the Title remained inve&s;ted until the entrance of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was conveyed to <HI>Wilkins,</HI> from whom by a quick Alienation it went away, and re&s;igned up its Intere&s;t by Sale to <HI>Bright,</HI> and in the Revenue of his De&s;cendant is the Proprietie of it yet wrapped up.</P>
<P><HI>Stourmouth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blengate,</HI> was a piece of that large Revenue, which owned the Signory of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ey.</HI> In the fifty fifth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, <HI>Henry le Hu&s;&s;ey</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren, to his Mannor of <HI>Stourmouth,</HI> and his Grand|child <HI>Henry le Hu&s;&s;ey</HI> died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it in the &s;ixth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, but, ala&s;s, neither the Noblene&s;s of the Name, nor widene&s;s of the Franchi&s;e, could keep this Family from departing from this place; for about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, I find it in the Tenure of the eminent Family of <HI>Apulderfield;</HI> but &s;etled not long here; for Sir <HI>William Apulderfield</HI> about the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth concluded

He was Governor of <HI>Gourney</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> in the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth under <HI>John Duke</HI> of <HI>Bedford</HI> the Regent; not farre from which Place, he defeated the Earl of <HI>Britaine</HI> and in that di&s;comfiture &s;lew &s;ix Hundred, and took two Hundred Pri&s;oners. In the fourteenth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, the Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI> infe&s;ted <HI>Crotoy</HI> with a Siege, which being &s;ucce&s;&s;efully rai&s;ed by the Lord <HI>Talbot,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Keriell</HI> a&s;&s;aults his Rear with that Courage, that he forced that Duke to a Di&s;orderly Retteat, leaving his Canon and Carriages behind him, as the Reward of his Valour and Fortune. In the twenty &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, he was &s;ent over into <HI>France</HI> with fifteen hundred men as a fre&s;h &s;upply to buoy up the &s;incking Affairs of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in that Nation, with which he recovered many pieces of &s;trength: but overlaid with Multitude in an Encounter at <HI>Formigney</HI> by the Earl of <HI>Clermont</HI> and the Con&s;table of <HI>France,</HI> after he had with unparallel'd Te&s;timonies of per&s;onal Cou|rage endeavoured to pre&s;erve the Fortune of the Day, he received a Defeat; the Ene|my buying his Victory at &s;o dear a rate, that it almo&s;t undid the Purcha&s;er. La&s;tly, his Fate ca&s;t him into that Civil Conte&s;t, which broke out between the two Hou&s;es of <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and being &s;atisfied with the Ju&s;tice of tho&s;e principles upon which the fir&s;t had engaged in Arms, became an eager A&s;&s;ertor of its Claim to the Diadem, and having enbarked him&s;elf with <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> then the Atlas of that Faction, in defence of it, at the &s;econd Battle of St. <HI>Albans</HI> peri&s;hed in the Ruines of that Field, and by an un&s;tained though a Calamitous Fidelity, became the great Example of Loyalty to the Hou&s;e of <HI>York.</HI> And he dying without I&s;&s;ue-male, one of his Daughters and Co-heirs, by matching with <HI>John Fogge</HI> of <HI>Repton</HI> E&s;quire, brought this Mannor upon the partition of the E&s;tate between <HI>Fogge</HI> and <HI>Bourchier,</HI> who wedded the other, to be annexed to the Demea&s;n of that Family, and upon his De|cea&s;e it de&s;cended to his Son <HI>Thomas Fogge</HI> Serjeant Porter of <HI>Callis,</HI> who dying with|out I&s;&s;ue-male, <HI>Anne Fogge</HI> who was one of his two Daughters and Co-heirs,

<P><HI>Waltham</HI> (in the Hundreds of <HI>Bredge, Petham,</HI> and <HI>Stowting</HI>) was anciently a Mem|ber of that Revenue; which acknowledged the Intere&s;s of the Knights Templers, as appears by a Survey taken of this Mannor, in the year of <HI>Grace,</HI> one thou&s;and one hundred and eighty, and regi&s;tred in the Book &s;tyled <HI>de Terris Templariorum,</HI> which is pre&s;erved in the Remembrancers Office in the Exchequer: and in that Sur|vey, there is mention made of <HI>Ivo de Haut,</HI> who held Lands at that Time of <HI>Temple Waltham,</HI> lying at <HI>Petham</HI> not far di&s;tant, which ju&s;tifies the Antiquity of that Name in this Track.

<P><HI>Whetacre</HI> is another &s;mall Mannor, that lies within the Circle of this Pari&s;h, not worth the memorial, were it not for a Family which extracted its Sirname from hence; for I find <HI>Nigellus de Whetacre</HI> mentioned in the Book of <HI>Aide,</HI> to have held Lands here, in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: In Times of a lower Date, that is, about the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, I find the Family of <HI>Hels</HI> or <HI>Hils,</HI> de&s;|cended from the <HI>Hels</HI> of <HI>Hels-court</HI> in <HI>Woditon</HI> to be planted in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and in this Name was the Intere&s;t of it con&s;tant, until the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, and then it was alienated to <HI>Prude,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or couveyed it to Alderman <HI>Cockain</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> from whom the &s;ame Stream of Vici&s;&s;itude carried it into <HI>Beacon.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Canons</HI> is the la&s;t Mannor in this Pari&s;h.

Tu&s;ton</HI> of <HI>Hothfield.</HI> The Par&s;onage anciently belonged to the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> until <HI>Thomas Arundell</HI> the Arch-bi&s;hop gave it, in the year 1397. to the Monks of <HI>Chri&s;t|church,</HI> to counterpoi&s;e tho&s;e va&s;t expences which they were to be at in re-erecting the Nave or Body of the Cathedral, (called <HI>Aulam Eccle&s;iae</HI> by <HI>Eadmerus</HI>) which <HI>Si|mon de Sudbury</HI> plucked down, and had intended that it &s;hould like a Phoenix, have ro&s;e more glorious out of its A&s;hes: but was intercepted in his De&s;ign by a &s;uddain Death, being beheaded by <HI>Wat Tiler,</HI> and the confluence of his impious and bar|barous Complices. This Church thus appropriated, was confirmed to the Monks above&s;aid, in the year 1400. by King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion was re-en&s;tated upon the Dean and Chapiter of <HI>Chri&s;t-church</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth.</P>
<P><HI>Ripley-court</HI> is a Seat of good Antiquity in this Pari&s;h, and more eminent, be|cau&s;e it afforded a Sirname to Gentlemen of good Ranke in this Track, of which Number was <HI>Richard de Ripley,</HI> who died &s;ei&s;ed of this Mannor, in the thirtieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 91. and in an old Deed is called <HI>Miles Ar|chiepi&s;copi,</HI> that is, he held this Mannor of the Arch-bi&s;hop by Knights Service: but before the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family was vani&s;hed, and then the <HI>Brockhuls</HI> and <HI>Idens</HI> &s;ucceeded in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: the la&s;t of which was a Family of great Antiquity, and no le&s;&s;e Revenue, about <HI>Iden</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Rolvenden</HI> in this County. For in the year 1280. as appears by a Fine levied that year; <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Thomas de Iden,</HI> pa&s;&s;es away Lands to <HI>John de More.</HI> And of this Family was <HI>Alexander Iden</HI> E&s;quire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, who in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, &s;lew <HI>Jack Cade,</HI> who had borrowed the di&s;gui&s;ed Per&s;on of <HI>Mortimer,</HI> excited thereunto, as was the Opinion of tho&s;e Times, by the Sugge&s;tions of <HI>Richard</HI> Duke of <HI>Yorke,</HI> to fathom the Peo|ples Affections to that man, in the &s;trength of who&s;e Title he intended in the future to claim the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Diadem. But the Attempts of <HI>Cade</HI> being di&s;appointed by the formerly infatuated, but now di&s;enchanted Multitude's de&s;erting of him, who be|gan to ri&s;ent his Fraud and Impo&s;ture upon their total Di&s;&s;ipation, &s;hrowded him|&s;elf in &s;ome of tho&s;e Grounds which belonged to <HI>Ripley-court,</HI> and lay not far di&s;tant from <HI>Hothfeild,</HI> and were then in the Tenure of <HI>VVilliam Iden</HI> Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and Father of the above&s;aid <HI>Alexander:</HI> where being di&s;covered, he was by that Worthy Per&s;on, offered up a Sacrifice to the Ju&s;tice of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth. But I have digre&s;&s;ed, I now return: After this Seat had for &s;o many De&s;cents been the Re|&s;idence of this Family, and the Cradle and Seminary of many Worthy Per&s;ons, who had been &s;ub&s;ervient and mini&s;terial to the Honour and Intere&s;s of this County, by their Magnanimity and Prudence; it went away from <HI>Iden</HI> by Sale to <HI>Darell;</HI> and <HI>George Darell,</HI> in the la&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, conveyed it to <HI>Baker,</HI> Ance&s;tor to Mr. ...... <HI>Baker</HI> of <HI>VVind&s;or,</HI> now proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Diggs-court</HI> is another eminent Seat in this Pari&s;h, which was the Man&s;ion of the Noble Family of <HI>Diggs</HI> or <HI>Digge,</HI> who promi&s;cuou&s;ly writ them&s;elves in elder Times &s;ometimes of <HI>Barham,</HI> and &s;ometimes of <HI>VVe&s;twell,</HI> as appears by many of their an|cient,
<PB N="356" REF="186">Evidences and other Muniments yet extant. In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, there was one <HI>Adomarus de Digge,</HI> who frequently writ him&s;elf of <HI>We&s;twell:</HI> but whe|ther it were he that was the Judge, or not, I cannot po&s;itively aver. In fine, after this place had for many Ages acknowledged the Signory of this Family, it came down to <HI>John Digge,</HI> in whom the Male-line ended; &s;o that his Female Heir being wed|ded to <HI>Henry Aucher,</HI> annexed it to the Revenue of that Family, and from him hath the Title by a Thread of many years, been guided down to Mr. ...... <HI>Aucher.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dean-court</HI> may be regi&s;tered likewi&s;e in the Catalogue of the principal Mannors of this Pari&s;h. It was in Times of elder pre&s;cription the Inheritance of <HI>Hu&s;&s;ie,</HI> who likewi&s;e was entituled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dean-court</HI> in <HI>Wingham,</HI> now the Man&s;ion of the <HI>Oxendens,</HI> by purcha&s;e from this Family. <HI>Henry Hu&s;&s;ie,</HI> a man of great pow|er, as appears by that large E&s;tate he was Lord of, both at <HI>Wingham, Lenham, Bough|ton, Malherbe,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, died po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Mannor, in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Numb.</HI> 36. and from him did it in an even and an un|divided Current glide along in this Name, until the latter end of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale to <HI>Milan,</HI> in which Family the proprie|ty of this place is now re&s;ident.</P>
<P><HI>Na&s;h-court</HI> is the next place in <HI>We&s;twell,</HI> that cals for our Survey; in old Deeds I find a Family that &s;ometimes writ <HI>At A&s;h,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> into which the for|mer Name re&s;olved, who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it: In Times of a lower Step, that is, in the thirty &s;econd year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the clo&s;e Roll of that year, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 94. <HI>Alanus de Hanekin</HI> held it: but before the latter end of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, this Family had quitted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by Sale to <HI>Brockhull</HI> of <HI>Calchill,</HI> and was not long after, that is, about the twelfth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by <HI>Henry Brockhull,</HI> conveyed to <HI>John Darell</HI> E&s;quire, Sheriff of <HI>Kent,</HI> in the ele|venth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and Brother of Sir <HI>William Darell,</HI> under-Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> and in this Name it was permanent, until the la&s;t year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, and then it went away by Sale to <HI>Sharpe</HI> of <HI>Nin-hou&s;e</HI> in great <HI>Chart,</HI> and hath been now for five De&s;cents re&s;ident in that Family.</P>
<P><HI>Beamon&s;ton,</HI> vulgarly called <HI>Beam&s;ton,</HI> is partly &s;ituated in <HI>We&s;t-well,</HI> and partly &s;pread into <HI>Ea&s;t-well:</HI> but the greate&s;t part of the Demea&s;ne is circum&s;cribed within the Bounds of this Pari&s;h. And in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, as appears by the Book of <HI>Aide,</HI> was held by <HI>Thomas at More,</HI> at making the Black Prince Knight. But before the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, this Family was extin|gui&s;hed; for at the Marriage of <HI>Blanch</HI> that Prince's Daughter, as appears by the Roll of <HI>Blanch</HI> Lands kept in the Exchequer, <HI>John Amias</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, and paid re&s;pective <HI>Aide</HI> for it, as having purcha&s;ed it of <HI>At-More:</HI> and in this Name did it re&s;ide, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and then it was conveyed by Sale to <HI>John Moile</HI> E&s;quire, Father to Sir <HI>Thomas Moile,</HI> who left this, with much other Land to <HI>Katharine</HI> his Daughter and Co-heir matched to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> in Right of which Alliance, it is now devolved to be the Inheritance of his great Grand-child <HI>Hencage Finch</HI> the in&s;tant Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perytowne</HI> lies likewi&s;e within the Limits of <HI>We&s;twell,</HI> and is regi&s;tered in the Ca|talogue of tho&s;e Lands that <HI>William de Aldon</HI> died po&s;&s;e&s;t of, in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third; and continued chained to the Inheritance of this Family, until about the twenty &s;eventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, it was pa&s;&s;ed away with much other other Land to Cardinal <HI>Kempe,</HI> who &s;etled it in the twenty eighth year of that Prince, on his newly erected Colledge of <HI>Wye,</HI> and re&s;ted there until the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then it was re&s;igned into the Hands of that Prince, and he in the thirty eighth year of his reign, granted it to <HI>Thomas Cawarden</HI> or <HI>Carden</HI> E&s;|quire, and he not long after conveyed it by Sale to Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> of <HI>Si&s;ingher&s;t,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or Sir <HI>John Baker</HI> Baronet, hath this pre&s;ent year 1657. alienated it to <HI>Na|thaniel Powell</HI> of <HI>Ewher&s;t</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P><HI>Woditon</HI> or <HI>Wolton,</HI> is the la&s;t place of any Note in <HI>We&s;twell:</HI> It was originally par|cel of the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Wolton</HI> or <HI>Woditon. Ivo de Woditon</HI> held it in the year 1236. and left it to his Son <HI>John de Wolton,</HI> who had I&s;&s;ue <HI>Richard de Wodi|ton</HI> or <HI>VVolton,</HI> a man of principal Note, in the twentieth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, who held both this Mannor, and <HI>VVoditon</HI> by <HI>Berham,</HI> which he held of the Arch-Bi&s;hop
<PB N="357" REF="186">of <HI>Canterbury</HI> by Knights Service at making the Black Prince Knight. And in this Man's Succe&s;&s;ors did the Propriety con&s;tantly re&s;ide until the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and then &s;ome part of it was conveyed to <HI>John Hampton,</HI> and he about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Richard Ra&s;el,</HI> who died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, as appears by his Will in the twentieth of that Prince; but there was &s;ome part remained un&s;old, until <HI>William Wolton</HI> dying 1540, ordered it by his Deed to be pa&s;&s;ed away to Feoffees in Tru&s;t to di&s;charge Debts, which accordingly was performed and the Remainder conveyed to <HI>Ra&s;ell,</HI> in the De&s;cendants of which Name and Family the entire proprietie is at this in&s;tant remaining.</P>
<P><HI>Werehorne</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Ham</HI> and <HI>Blackbourne,</HI> was partly under the Juri&s;diction of the Church, and partly under the Signory of temporal and Lay Proprietaries: that Moitie of it which was of &s;ecular Intere&s;t, belonged to a Family called <HI>Bedford. Rich. de Bedford</HI> obtained a Grant of a Market to it weekly on the <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> and a Fair of three days continuance at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> as appears <HI>Cart.</HI> 52. <HI>Henrici tertii Memb.</HI> 12, which was renued and confirmed to the above&s;aid Per&s;on in the eighth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t; and he in the &s;eventeenth year of that Prince died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, as is manife&s;t, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 20. But after him it was of no long date in the Tenure of this Family; for in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, I find it in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hugh de VVindle&s;ore</HI> or <HI>VVind&s;or;</HI> but was not long chained to their Patrimony neither; for about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was alienated to <HI>Moraunt</HI> of <HI>Moraunts Court,</HI> but about the beginning of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, Sir <HI>Thomas Morant</HI> (Son of <HI>VVilliam Moraunt</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the twelfth and thirteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to whom that Prince i&s;&s;ued out a Mandate, that but one Bell &s;hould be rang in any Steeple towards the Sea-Coa&s;t in <HI>Kent</HI>) determined in a Female Heir, who was matched to <HI>James Peckham</HI> of <HI>Yaldham</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> the third and twelfth of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and was as the private evidences of this Family inform me, originally de&s;cended from <HI>Hugh de Peckham,</HI> who was Con&s;table of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> under K. <HI>John</HI> in the fir&s;t year of his reign; and he in her right became entituled to that Intere&s;t <HI>Moraunt</HI> had in this place: and in this Family it remained until tho&s;e Times which approached near the Confines of our Grand-fathers remembrance, and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Ellis;</HI> from whence in Oppo&s;ition to the other Moitie which was of &s;piritual Concernment it was called <HI>Werehorne Ellis,</HI> and from this Fa|mily not many years &s;ince it was carried off by Sale to <HI>Tufton,</HI> in right of which purcha&s;e the right honourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> is now inve&s;ted in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>The other Moietie which belonged to the Church, was given in the year of <HI>Grace</HI> 1010, by <HI>Elphegus</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> to the Monks of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church,</HI> and was for the provi&s;ion of their Garments. And if you will di&s;cover how this was rated in the twentieth year of <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conquerour, the Record of <HI>Doom&s;-day</HI> Book will di&s;cover: <HI>In Limwarled,</HI> &s;ays the Note, <HI>&amp; in Hundred de Hamme habent Monachi Sanctae Trinitatis de ve&s;titu eorum</HI> 1. <HI>Manerium de VVerehorne</HI> 1. <HI>Sulling, &amp; e&s;t appretiatum LXs.</HI> This Mannor being by the Monks and Prior of the Convent afore&s;aid &s;ur|rendred into the Hands of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth in the twenty ninth year of his reign, it lay couched in the Demea&s;n of the Crown, until the &s;eventh year of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was by Grant pa&s;&s;ed away to <HI>Tho. Paget,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Twi&s;den</HI> who in oppo&s;ition to the other Moity which was of temporal Intere&s;s, called this, <HI>Werehorn Twi&s;den:</HI> and they not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to Sir <HI>Thomas Tufton,</HI> Grand-father to the right ho|nourable <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Thanet</HI> the in&s;tant Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it.</P>
<P><HI>Tinton</HI> in <HI>VVerehorne</HI> was a Mannor which anciently belonged to the Priory of <HI>Horton</HI> near <HI>Hieth;</HI> but upon the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion all its Demea&s;n being annexed to the Crown, this was lodged there until the beginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was by that Prince conveyed by Grant to Sir <HI>VVilliam Sidley</HI> of the Frierie in <HI>Alresford,</HI> Grand-father to Sir <HI>Charles Sidley</HI> Baronet the pre&s;ent Lord of the Fee.</P>
<P><HI>Capell</HI> in this Pari&s;h gave Seat and Sirname to a Family &s;o called, who&s;e Demea&s;n lay &s;pread into <HI>Ivie-Church, Linton, Boxley, Hor&s;monden, Capell</HI> by <HI>Brechley, Capell</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Shepey</HI> and this Pari&s;h. <HI>John de Capell</HI> flouri&s;hed here in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who was (as appears by the <HI>Leiger</HI> Book of <HI>Boxley</HI>) an eminent Benefactor to
<PB N="358" REF="187">that Covent; and from him de&s;cended Sir <HI>VVilliam at Capell,</HI> an eminent Knight of this County, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third and <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, who left it to his Son <HI>Richard at Capell:</HI> and he dying without I&s;&s;ue, in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, Sir <HI>John Orlan&s;ton</HI> in right of his Wife, who was his Si&s;ter and Co-heir entred upon his Inheritance at this place, and left it to his Son <HI>Richard Orlan&s;ton</HI> Esq; who decea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue in the &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth: and &s;o upon the Divi&s;ion of the E&s;tate, <HI>VVilliam Scot</HI> who had e&s;pou&s;ed <HI>Joan</HI> one of the Si&s;ters and Co-heirs, was planted in the Inheritance of this place; and from whom it is now devolved to be the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Edward Scot</HI> of <HI>Scots-Hall</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P><HI>Ham</HI> is another eminent Mannor in this Pari&s;h which gives Name to the whole Hundred, and was, as high as the Ray of any Intelligence will guide us to di&s;cover, folded up in the paternal Demea&s;n of the ancient Family of <HI>Orlan&s;ton. VVilliam de Orlan&s;ton</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-Warren to his Lands at <HI>Orlan&s;ton, VVerehorne,</HI> and other places, in the fifty fir&s;t of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and being fenced in with this Immunity, it came along by the Steps of Several De&s;cents to <HI>Richard Orlan&s;ton</HI> Son of Sir <HI>John Orlan&s;ton,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue in the &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, as is manife&s;t, <HI>Rot. E&s;c.

<P><HI>Parkers</HI> is another Mannor which next &s;ummons our remembrance, which afforded a Sirname, as it gave an Habitation to a Family &s;o &s;tyled. <HI>Edward Parker</HI> held Lands in <HI>Werehore, We&s;terham,</HI> and other places at his Decea&s;e, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, as appears, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 1.14. and in this Name was the Title and Inheritance con&s;tant until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and then I find by &s;everal Court-rolls one <HI>John Engham</HI> to be fixed by purcha&s;e in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: and in this Family did it remain uninterrupted until the beginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> and then it was by Sale conveyed to <HI>Taylor,</HI> who not long after demi&s;ed it to <HI>Collins;</HI> from whom not long &s;ince it came by purcha&s;e to <HI>Squire,</HI> and he not many years &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed it away to Dr. ...... <HI>King&s;ley</HI> Arch-Deacon of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in who&s;e De&s;cendants the Proprietie of it, is &s;till re&s;ident.</P>
<P><HI>Hampton Cocle&s;combe</HI> is the la&s;t place con&s;iderable in <HI>Werehorne;</HI> which gave Name originally to a Family which here had their Habitation, and likewi&s;e were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of much Land at <HI>We&s;twell,</HI> and other places; and having lived here many De&s;cents, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place at la&s;t devolved to <HI>John Hampton,</HI> who about the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>John May</HI> of <HI>Bibrook:</HI> who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;or <HI>John May</HI> concluding about the latter end in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Alice</HI> matched to <HI>John Edolph</HI> it came to be the Inheritance of that Family; but did not long con|fe&s;s the Signory of it; for this <HI>John Edolph</HI> decea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue-male, and left it to his &s;ole Daughter <HI>Elizabeth</HI> matched to <HI>William Wilcock,</HI> who expiring likewi&s;e in two Female Heirs, <HI>Martha</HI> matched to <HI>Edward Ratcliff</HI> Doctor of Phy&s;ick, and Phy&s;itian to Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and K. <HI>James;</HI> and the &s;econd matched to <HI>William Andrews,</HI> they divided this Mannor as parcel of his Inheritance. <HI>William Andrews</HI> in the twenty ninth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> demi&s;ed his proportion to <HI>Rowland Bridges</HI> and <HI>Robert Philip&s;on.</HI> And <HI>Edward Radcliff</HI> alienated that part of it which accrued to him in the forty third year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to <HI>Edward Rolt</HI> and <HI>Andrew Mer&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We&s;terham</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred wherein it is placed, and was in elder Times the patrimony of a Family called <HI>Camville,</HI> which was of &s;ome eminence in this Track. <HI>William de Camville,</HI> and <HI>G. de Camville</HI> entred <HI>England</HI> with <HI>VVilliam</HI> the Conquerour. <HI>Thomas de Camville</HI> was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae A&s;&s;i&s;ae</HI> in the &s;eventh year of K. <HI>John:</HI> and <HI>Geffrey de Camville</HI> was with <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and there received the Order of Knighthood, and here this Family concluded: for afterwards I find this Mannor in the Hands of the Abbot of <HI>VVe&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who obtained a Market weekly to be held at this place on the <HI>Munday</HI> and a Fair yearly upon the Vigil, the
<PB N="359" REF="187">day, and day after the Nativity of our Lady, as appears, <HI>Pat.</HI> 25. <HI>Edwardi tertii Num.</HI> 32.

<P><HI>Werd</HI> or <HI>Werth</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Ea&s;try</HI> is a Pari&s;h if you con&s;ider it in its precincts, but narrow; if in po&s;ition, low and unhealthful, or, if again in its number of Com|municants, not con&s;iderable; but yet there are two places within the Ambuts and Boundaries of it which claim &s;ome con&s;ideration. The fir&s;t is the Mannor of <HI>San|downe,</HI> which was anciently the <HI>Perots,</HI> who held this Mannor as the private Deeds of this Name and Family inform me, as high as the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. <HI>Thomas de Perot</HI> died po&s;&s;e&s;t of it in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, <HI>Rot.

For <HI>Edward Langley</HI> of <HI>Knolton</HI> E&s;quire, decea&s;ing about the beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth with|out I&s;&s;ue; Sir <HI>Robert Peyton</HI> of <HI>Peyton</HI> Hall entred upon this and other Lands as his Heir at Law; and he a&s;&s;igned it to his &s;econd Son <HI>John Peyton</HI> E&s;quire, from whom it is now de&s;cended to Sir <HI>Thomas Peyton</HI> Baronet, the in&s;tant proprietary of it.</P>
<P>Before I leave this Di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Sandowne,</HI> I mu&s;t inform the Reader that the Fa|mily of <HI>Peyton</HI> above mentioned and that of <HI>Ufford</HI> were primitively one, and bore the &s;ame paternal Coat, were known by the &s;ame Name, and were both deduced from the &s;ame Root and Original,

<P><HI>Lidde</HI> in ancient Records written <HI>Hlyden</HI> is a &s;econd Mannor in <HI>Werd</HI> of con&s;idera|ble Account, ever &s;ince it was given at the Reque&s;t of <HI>Janibert</HI> the Arch-Bi&s;hop by K. <HI>Offa</HI> in the year 874 to the Monks of <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> (as the Records of that Church di&s;cover to me) under the Notion of three Sullings or Ploughlands. And the In&s;trument which confirmed this Donation, was &s;igned with the Marks that is Cro&s;&s;es of <HI>Offa</HI> the King, <HI>Janibert</HI> the Arch-Bi&s;hop, <HI>Kenedrith</HI> the Queen, three other Bi&s;hops, five other Abbots, Duke <HI>Edbald,</HI> and eleven other principal Per&s;ons or Noblemen. And that this was the manner of Signature in elder Times, that is, the affixing of Cro&s;&s;es to all publick In&s;truments and other original Donations, is mo&s;t certain; For Sealing came into <HI>England</HI> with <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, who being bred up in <HI>Normandy,</HI> in which Province, and in <HI>France</HI> the U&s;e of affixing Seals to Deeds had been in U&s;e long before his Time, introduced that Cu&s;tome and way of Signa|ture into this Nation, as being more con&s;picuous and di&s;tingui&s;hable than that of Cro&s;&s;es, or tho&s;e other wayes of confirming of Grants of Land, either to the Church or to &s;ecular U&s;es, which was either <HI>per Collocationem Gladii &s;eu Cultelli &s;upra Altare,</HI> by the placing or laying a Sword or Knife upon the Altar, whereby tho&s;e which did make Donations of Land did tacitly in&s;inuate that their Honour was involved in their Con&s;cience, or el&s;e <HI>per Traditionem Surculi vel &s;tipitis,</HI> which Cu&s;tome is yet ob&s;erved in our Copy-hold Land, where Surrenders are made by delivery of a Turfe, Twig, or
<PB N="361" REF="188">white Wand. But &s;ealing with Coats of Arms, was not brought in, untill the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, but were borne by per&s;ons of Honor on their Tabards or Sur|coats: two Examples of which I have &s;een, one of <HI>William Warren</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> who in the &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, &s;ealed with the Figure of a <HI>Chivaler on Hor&s;eback;</HI> his Capari&s;ons, Tabard, and Shield, being all <HI>Checquee,</HI> the paternal Coat of this Family; the other was of <HI>Richard Curzon</HI> of <HI>Croxall</HI> in <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> who in the reign of King <HI>John,</HI> &s;tands in a Window pourtrayed in his Surcoat, &s;urmounted with a <HI>Bend,</HI> charged with a <HI>Martlet.</HI> And this was done in Imitation of the Heralds, who wore the Arms of tho&s;e Princes they &s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d on their Tabards, as Bad|ges to di&s;tingui&s;h them from the Heralds of other Princes, either in the Time of War or Peace. Indeed Seals in higher Ages, were of that &s;acred E&s;timate, that be|ing lo&s;t, they were decryed by the owners, lea&s;t they might be affixed to any &s;urrep|titious In&s;trument, which might prejudice either their Fame or E&s;tate. And in the interval of their Ab&s;ence or Lo&s;&s;e, the Owners above&s;aid were accu&s;tomed to Seal with the Seal of the Bi&s;hop of the Dioce&s;s, or el&s;e with that of the next adjacent Abbot, all Deeds and In&s;truments, either of Publick or private Intere&s;s. But to re|turn: this Donation of <HI>Offa's,</HI> though thus &s;ecured and &s;trengthned, could not &s;hel|ter this Mannor, from the Rage of ahat Tempe&s;t, which, in the twenty ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, like a Whirlwind caught it up in the Patrimony of the Church, and drop'd it into the Revenue of the Crown, where it lay untill Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in the Beginning of her Raign, pa&s;&s;ed it away by Grant to <HI>William Lovelace</HI> E&s;quire, Ser|jeant at Law, who&s;e Son Sir <HI>William Lovelace,</HI> not long after, demi&s;ed it by Sale to Sir <HI>John Smith,</HI> Grand-father to <HI>Philip</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Strangford,</HI> who now enjoys it.</P>

After this Family had de&s;erted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it became the Inheritance of many of the mo&s;t eminent Nobility of this Kingdome. I &s;hall repre&s;ent them out of &s;ome ancient Court-rolls in a Compendious Series. <HI>Edmund Plantagenet</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> held it in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>William Longspey</HI> had it in the the twentieth year of the above&s;aid Prince, and paid an auxiliary &s;upply for it at making the Black Prince Knight. <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent</HI> dyed &s;ei&s;ed of it in the twenty &s;ixth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third. <HI>Thomas Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI> his Wife, Si&s;ter and Coheir of the abovementioned Earl, were po&s;&s;e&s;t of it in the thirty fifth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>Lucie</HI> Wife of <HI>Edmund Holland</HI> Earl of <HI>Kent,</HI> was &s;ei&s;ed of it in the &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth.

<P><HI>Wenderton</HI> is an ancient Seat in this Pari&s;h (eminent for its excellent Air, Situation, and pro&s;pect) which for many hundreds of years had owners of that Sirname, one of whom called <HI>John Wenderton</HI> is famous in <HI>Fox</HI>'s Martyrologie for the pennance impo&s;ed upon him by <HI>William Courtney</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> at his Ca&s;tle of <HI>Saltwood,</HI> in the year 1390 for being refractory in the Di&s;charge of &s;ome Services which were due to his Mannor of <HI>Wingham.</HI> The la&s;t of this Name which enjoyed this Seat was <HI>John Wenderton,</HI> who in the fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>William Warham</HI> Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and he upon his Decea&s;e which was about the year 1533 gave it to his Brother <HI>Hugh Warham,</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Hugh Warham</HI> a|bout the beginning of K. <HI>James</HI> tran&s;planted his right in it by Sale into <HI>William Manwood</HI> E&s;quire, and he about the beginning of K. <HI>Charles</HI> conveyed it to <HI>Vincent Denne</HI> Gentleman, who left it to his Nephew Mr. <HI>Thomas Denne</HI> of <HI>Grays Inne,</HI> who dying without I&s;&s;ue &s;ettled it by Will on his Brother <HI>John Denne</HI> of the <HI>Inner Temple</HI> E&s;quire, who likewi&s;e decea&s;ed without I&s;&s;ue, and bequeathed it to his four Maiden Si&s;ters. <HI>Roger Lukyn</HI> Gentleman who matched with one of them purcha&s;ed the Re|mainder of the other three, and &s;o is become now &s;ole Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Twitham</HI> in this Pari&s;h gave Seat and Sirname to an eminent Family in this Track; <HI>Alan de Twitham</HI> is recorded in the Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e remarkable <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who &s;upported the Cau&s;e and Quarrel of <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t at the Seige of <HI>Acon;</HI> and having continued many De&s;cents Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this Mannor, the Name at la&s;t deter|mined in a Female Heir called <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> who by matching with <HI>Richard Oxenden</HI> united <HI>Twitham</HI> to the Demea&s;n of that Family, where the Title hath ever &s;ince made &s;o con&s;tant and uninterrupted an abode, that it is &s;till the Inheritance of Mr. <HI>Henry Oxenden</HI> of <HI>Brook place.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brook place</HI> is the la&s;t place of e&s;timate in this Pari&s;h, which in elder Times was wrapped up in the Inheritance of <HI>Wenderton,</HI> and having continued many De&s;cents interlinked with this Family, the Name and Title found one Sepulcher together for <HI>Jane Wenderton</HI> the Heir General of the Family by matching with <HI>Richard Oxenden</HI> Gentleman fixed it in his Inheritance, and he much enhaun&s;ed this ancient Seat with Additional Improvements, and from him the Right of De&s;cent hath now made it the Patrimony of Mr. <HI>Henry Oxenden.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whit&s;taple</HI> gives Name to the whole Hundred which &s;urrounds it, and was a Branch of that ample Patrimony, which encrea&s;ed the Revenue of <HI>Alex. de Baliol,</HI> E. of <HI>Atholl,</HI> and he held this and a place called <HI>Grafton</HI> in this Pari&s;h, as likewi&s;e a wood called <HI>Northwood</HI> not farre di&s;tant, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and left it to his Son and Heir <HI>John Earl</HI> of <HI>Athol,</HI> who having with an un&s;ucce&s;sful zeal endeavoured to &s;upport the &s;inking Intere&s;t of the Kingdome of <HI>Scotland,</HI> again&s;t the violent Eruptions of <HI>Edw.</HI> the fir&s;t, which like an impetuous Inundation, &s;ought to bear down all the Glory of that Nation, into an irrecoverable Ruine, was in an infortunate Encounter made Captive by that Prince, and being attainted of high Trea&s;on, and Executed, his E&s;tate here by E&s;cheat devolved to the Crown, and was by <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, in the ninth of his reign granted to <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Badele&s;mere:</HI> but he having again lo&s;t it by his Re|volt and Defection in the &s;ixteenth and &s;eventeenth years of that Prince, it revolved to the Crown and continued there, until K. <HI>Edward</HI> the third in the &s;econd year of his Reign re&s;tored it to <HI>Bartholomew de Badele&s;mer</HI> his Son, who died in the twelfth year of the above&s;aid Prince, and left it to his Brother <HI>Giles de Badele&s;mer,</HI> and he decea&s;ing
<PB N="365" REF="190">without I&s;&s;ue it accrued by <HI>Mawde</HI> one of his Si&s;ters and Coheirs to be the Inheritance of <HI>John Vere</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and he held it at his Death, which was in the thirty fourth year of <HI>Edw.</HI> the third, and to this Family it remained by the Links of many De&s;cents &s;ucce&s;&s;ively fa&s;tned, until at la&s;t that Revolution which is made by Sale ca&s;t it into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Phineux;</HI> the la&s;t of which who enjoyed it was <HI>John Phineux</HI> E&s;quire, who concluded in a Daughter and Heir called <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> who by matching with Sir <HI>John Smith</HI> of <HI>O&s;tenhanger,</HI> knit it to his E&s;tate, from whom by the Devolution of De&s;cent it is now come to confe&s;s for proprietary the right honourable <HI>Philip</HI> Vi&s;count <HI>Strangford</HI> his Grand-child.</P>
<P>Secondly, there is <HI>Che&s;tfield,</HI> which was the Man&s;ion of a Family which bore that Sirname, and although I can trace none higher by any publick Record then <HI>James Che&s;tfield,</HI> who paid re&s;pective Aid for it at the making the Black Prince Knight, as is manife&s;t by the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> collected in the twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, yet it is upon po&s;&s;ible Conjectures to be argued that they were farre more ancient here, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;umed their Denomination from this Seat; from <HI>Che&s;tfield</HI> about the latter end of the Government of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, it came over by purcha&s;e to <HI>Henry Reyner;</HI> but whether he i&s;&s;ued from <HI>Borden,</HI> or the <HI>Reyners</HI> of <HI>Borden</HI> from him, I cannot di&s;|cover; but it is very probable he determined in four Daughters and Coheirs matched to <HI>Edmund Meade, Jo. Badkin, John Reynolds,</HI> and <HI>John Springate,</HI> who concurred in one united Con&s;ent, and by one common conveyance demi&s;ed their Intere&s;t in it to <HI>John Roper</HI> of St. <HI>Dun&s;tans;</HI> from whom <HI>Edward Roper</HI> E&s;quire, now of <HI>Well-hall</HI> in <HI>Eltham,</HI> claims the in&s;taut Demea&s;n and Signory of it.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Grimgill</HI> &s;o vulgarly called, but originally and more properly <HI>Green&s;hield,</HI> for &s;o it is in Records of an elder A&s;pect alwayes written. It was the Seat of a Family that was known by that Appellation, and although the Breviat of the private Evidences which relate to it, di&s;cover to us owners of the Name no higher then <HI>John Green&s;hield,</HI> who flouri&s;hed here about the entrance into the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and who was Father to <HI>Henry Green&s;hield,</HI> who&s;e Will is Regi&s;tred at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and which bears Date from the la&s;t of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; yet it is more then probable that they were eminent here long before, becau&s;e the above-recited <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Henry Green&s;hields,</HI> were Lords of no de&s;picable or narrow fortune not onely here, but about <HI>Sandwich</HI> and <HI>Wodnesborough</HI> likewi&s;e; from <HI>Green&s;hield</HI> by &s;ale the propriety pa&s;&s;ed over to <HI>Quekes</HI> of <HI>Quekes</HI> in <HI>Birchington,</HI> who &s;uddenly after being extingui&s;hed in a Daughter and Heir, all his Intere&s;t in <HI>Grimgill,</HI> was with her tran&s;ported in Marriage to <HI>Cri&s;pe,</HI> originally extracted out of the County of <HI>Gloce&s;ter;</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe</HI> E&s;quire held his Shrievalty here, which was in the &s;econd year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> from <HI>Cri&s;pe</HI> it was by purcha&s;e conveyed into the Revenue of <HI>Paramour,</HI> where after it had for &s;everal years been fixed, it was very lately taken off from this Family, and by Sale made the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Twiman</HI> of <HI>Canterbury.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, here was <HI>Condies-place</HI> which was the Re&s;idence of <HI>John Condie,</HI> who had in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third contracted upon him&s;elf, (which is yet indelibly fixed upon his Memory) a Character of high Account, becau&s;e he had made an emi|nent Enemie of the Kings Captive <HI>in Congre&s;&s;u Bellico,</HI> tho&s;e are the words of the Record in a per&s;onal Combat; for which he had thirty pound <HI>per Annum</HI> &s;etled upon him out of the Kings Profits of the <HI>Staple</HI> at <HI>Canterbury</HI> by Charter or Grant from <HI>Edward</HI> the third dated the &s;eventh day of <HI>July</HI> in the fourteenth year of his reign. Now if you will know, where this memorable Action was commenced, the &s;ame Record will in|form you, that the Scene of it was laid at <HI>Swine</HI> in <HI>Normandy:</HI> But to proceed: this Man not long after he was thus adorned with the&s;e Tophies of Honour, paid that Debt to Nature, which we all owe, and left <HI>Condies Hall</HI> to his Son <HI>William Condy,</HI> who dying without any lawful I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Margaret Condy</HI> one of his Si&s;ters became his Co-heir, who by her e&s;pou&s;als with <HI>Robert Grubbe</HI> made <HI>Condies Hall</HI> parcel of his Demea&s;n; but he likewi&s;e in the Age &s;ub&s;equent to this determining in Females, <HI>Agnes</HI> one of his Co|heirs being wedded to <HI>John I&s;aack</HI> of <HI>Blackmanbery</HI> in <HI>Bridge,</HI> did much &s;well and improve his Patrimony, with that Additional E&s;tate &s;he united to his, and here in this Name was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for &s;undry De&s;cents re&s;ident, even till our Fathers Memory. But here for want of Intelligence, I can proceed no farther; and indeed the Place being fallen from its original Name by Di&s;u&s;e, and that Repute it was under, when it was

<P><HI>Willesborough</HI> in the Hundreds of <HI>Chart</HI> and <HI>Longbridge</HI> has nothing to make it me|morable but that it was a principal piece of that revenue which in this County related to the noble and ancient Family of <HI>Brent;</HI> of which was <HI>Falcatius de Brent,</HI> a man whom our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory pencils out to us under a Character of the mo&s;t perfect Courage and Magnanimity, though di&s;ordered with &s;ome wild Sallies and Exce&s;&s;es: which peradventure may be attributed to the Evaporations of youth, which is alwayes volatile and airy, rather then to any &s;etled and contracted Habit of vitious Di&s;tem|pers, and mutinous pa&s;&s;ions which was lodged within Him. But to proceed: when <HI>Willesborough</HI> had by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive thread of many Ages been guided along through &s;eve|ral De&s;cents down to <HI>John Brent,</HI> he died and left <HI>John Brent</HI> his Heir, who expiring without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Margaret</HI> his elde&s;t Si&s;ter became the Inheritrix of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;he being matched with <HI>John Dering</HI> E&s;quire of <HI>Surrenden Dering,</HI> this place by Female right became tran&s;planted into the Patrimony of that Name and Family, and Sir <HI>Edward Dering</HI> about the year 1635, conveyed it to <HI>Robert Scot</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> E&s;quire, who&s;e Son and Heir <HI>Thomas Scot</HI> of <HI>Canterbury</HI> E&s;quire is now proprietary of it.</P>

<P><HI>Wickham Bu&s;hes</HI> is another Mannor which has its Situation within the Limits of <HI>Woditon,</HI> and was, as the Light of the mo&s;t ancient Evidences does guide us to believe, the Patrimony of <HI>Guldeford;</HI> for <HI>Henry de Guldeford,</HI> (as the Book of <HI>Aid</HI> di&s;covers to us) did hold it by Knights Service, of <HI>Geffrey de Say,</HI> in the twentieth year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the third; but in a De&s;cent or two after, this Family was &s;hrunk away from the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of this place, and then the ancient and illu&s;trious Family of <HI>Digge</HI> of <HI>Digge's Court</HI> in <HI>Berham,</HI> was the next which &s;ucceeded in the Propriety and Inheritance, and to this Name was the Title of this place, by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Series of many Generations fa&s;tned, till in our Fathers Memory it was by &s;ale rent off, and by that Alienation linked to the Revenue of <HI>Coppen,</HI> in who&s;e Demea&s;n the Intere&s;t of it at this Day con|tinues included.</P>
<P><HI>Woodchurch</HI> in the Hundred of <HI>Blackbourn,</HI> was the Habitation of a Family of as deep Root in Antiquity as any in this Track, who extracted their Sirname, as well as borrow|ed their fir&s;t Original, from this place. <HI>Roger de Woodchurch</HI> is the fir&s;t who does occurre, who in the ancient Evidences and the Deeds of this place, which are not cloi&s;tered within any Date finds a frequent Mention, and from him (as appears by an old Pedigree of this Family) did it devolve to his Grandchild Sir <HI>Simon de Woodchurch,</HI> who is in the Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e eminent Per&s;ons who accompanied <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t in his Victori|ous and triumphant Expedition into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where his Victories entailed upon his Memory the Character of <HI>Malleus Scotorum,</HI> but in this Sir <HI>Simon:</HI> the Name though not the Male Line determined, for he by matching with <HI>Su&s;an,</HI> Heir of <HI>Henry le Clerke</HI> of <HI>Munfidde,</HI> brought a large Inheritance to own the Signory of <HI>Woodchurch;</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors in Gratitude to a Family which had added &s;o much of &s;plendor, and annexed &s;o plentiful a Revenue to this Name, altered their paternal Appellation from <HI>Wood|church</HI> to <HI>Clerke;</HI> and &s;o in all their Deeds &s;ub&s;equent to this Match, have written <HI>Clerke</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>Woodchurch</HI> ever &s;ince.

<P><HI>Pleurinden</HI> in this Pari&s;h is a Branch of that E&s;tate which fell under the Signory of the ancient and Knightly Family of <HI>Engham,</HI> very frequently in old Deeds and other Monuments written <HI>Edingham,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Hengham:</HI> In a Deed wherein there is mention of a Match between ....... one of the Co-heirs of Sir <HI>Stephen de Penche&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Henry de Cobham,</HI> and wherein &s;ome Land is conveyed over to <HI>Cobham,</HI> there are the&s;e Per&s;ons recorded to be <HI>Te&s;tes</HI> to it, <HI>William de Savage, William de Oure, Otho de Grandi&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Roger de Hengham.</HI> The Deed is very ancient, and though not con|fined to any &s;trict or preci&s;e Date, yet commences from the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, and from this <HI>Roger</HI> did <HI>Vincent Engham</HI> E&s;quire lineally de&s;cend, who in the ....... year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away by Sale to <HI>Roger Twi&s;den</HI> E&s;quire, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Roger Twi&s;den</HI> Baronet, in whom is fixed the in&s;tant Propriety of it.</P>

<P><HI>Henher&s;t</HI> is the la&s;t place con&s;iderable in <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> which was the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a Family of that Denomination, of whom I have &s;poken at <HI>Stapleher&s;t,</HI> where they en|joyed another Mannor of this Name, and of which Family this here was but a Cadet or younger Slip, and was written &s;ometimes <HI>Henher&s;t,</HI> and as often in old Deeds <HI>Eng|her&s;t,</HI> and continued Owners of this place, until the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and then it devolved to Sir <HI>Thomas Hengher&s;t,</HI> who was the la&s;t of that Name which held this place, for he dying without I&s;&s;ue Male, <HI>Humfrey Wi&s;e</HI> who had matched with his Daughter and Heir in her right was inve&s;ted in the Inheritance of it, but he decea&s;ing likewi&s;e without I&s;&s;ue Male, his &s;ole Inheritrix united it by marriage to the Revenue of her Husband Mr. <HI>Robert Ma&s;ters,</HI> Great Grand-father to Mr. <HI>Edward Ma&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> in whom the propriety of this place is at this prefent continued.</P>
<P><HI>Henden</HI> likewi&s;e is an Appendage to <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> from whence certainly the Name of <HI>Henden</HI> originally &s;treamed out, though it be brought down to our Times in &s;o crooked and perplexed a Chanel, that we cannot di&s;cover it in all the wandrings and Digre&s;&s;ions of it, though the Family was made more con&s;picuous, by Sir <HI>Edward Henden</HI> one of the Barons of the Exchequer to the late King <HI>Charles:</HI> who for his clear &s;peculation and in&s;ight into the deepe&s;t and mo&s;t my&s;terious Intrigues of the Mu|nicipal Law of <HI>England,</HI> was commonly called the Picklock of it. But this is a Diver|&s;ion: The ancient Proprietaries of <HI>Henden,</HI> repre&s;ented to us by the elde&s;t Records, were the Lords <HI>Burwa&s;h,</HI> very frequently written <HI>Burghher&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Lord <HI>Burwa&s;h</HI> had a Charter of Free Warren granted to <HI>Henden,</HI> in the eighteenth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. And when this Family had de&s;erted the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, the next which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively held it were the <HI>Capells</HI> of <HI>Capells Court</HI> in <HI>Ivie-Church,</HI> and <HI>Richard Capell</HI> died &s;ei&s;ed of it in the fifteenth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd: and here, after it had been for &s;ome Generations fixed, the Name re&s;olved into a Daughter and Heir, who was matched unto <HI>Harlackenden,</HI> and &s;o it became twi&s;ted into the Revenue of that Family, and &s;o remained till <HI>Deborah Harlackenden</HI> the Heir General of <HI>Walter Harlackenden,</HI> a Branch of this Stock, by being wedded to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> Knight and Baronet, Grand-father to Sir <HI>Edward Hales</HI> now of <HI>Tun&s;tall</HI> Baronet, wound it up in the Demea&s;n and Intere&s;t of that Honourable Family.</P>
<P>The <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Harlackenden</HI> is &s;ituated in this Pari&s;h, and has been for many hun|dred of years the Patrimonial Demea&s;n of that Name and Family, as appears by a Tomb in the Church of <HI>Woodchurch,</HI> who&s;e In&s;cription &s;ignifies that one of them lies enterr'd there a little after the Conque&s;t: and though the Character be in the proporti|on and Shape of it very much like that which was in u&s;e in the reign of <HI>Hen.</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and &s;o makes the Truth of it di&s;putable, yet to this 'tis an&s;wered, that there was an old Tomb&s;tone there before, with the &s;ame In&s;cription upon it, in|&s;culped peradventure in a <HI>Saxon</HI> Character, or &s;uch an one as was proportionate to that time in which that per&s;on died, who lies there entombed: which being decayed his Succe&s;&s;ors to perpetuate and inforce the Memory of &s;o ancient a Predece&s;&s;or, fixed this Stone upon his Grave, and, to make the Memorial more obvious, did cau&s;e the Epitaph to be engraven in &s;uch a Letter, as was Cu&s;tomary to the Time of that Prince, in who&s;e reign it was laid upon the A&s;hes beneath.

It lies partly in <HI>Godmer&s;ham,</HI> and partly in this Pari&s;h, and was for many hundred years the patrimony of a Family which bore that Sirname, and remained linked to their Demea&s;n, until the ninth year of Q. <HI>Elizabeth:</HI> and then <HI>William Bilting</HI> decea&s;ing without I&s;&s;ue, <HI>Arthur Franklin,</HI> and <HI>Richard Vidian</HI> were found to be his Heirs, and upon the Divi&s;ion of the E&s;tate into parcels, this &s;welled the E&s;tate of <HI>Franklin</HI> with a new Addition, and continued in that Name, until not many years &s;ince partly by Sale, and partly by Marriage it was &s;ettled upon Mr. <HI>William Cowper</HI> of <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> upon who&s;e late Decea&s;e it is now devolved by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Right to his De&s;cendant Mr. ....... <HI>Cowper</HI> now in his Mi|noritie.</P>
<P><HI>Perry Court</HI> is the next place which obliges us to a Con&s;ideration. It was wrapped up, in that Demea&s;n which related to the Colledge of <HI>Wye,</HI> and was purcha&s;ed by Cardinal <HI>John Kempe</HI> of <HI>Thomas Aldon</HI> (who&s;e Ance&s;tors had held it many De|&s;cents before) in the twenty eighth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and by him annexed to the Colledge above mentioned, of his own In&s;titution and Foundation: But the publick Di&s;&s;olution in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth having &s;natched it away, it was by the Grant of that Prince made the Inheritance of Mr. <HI>John Buckler,</HI> who about the beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, pa&s;&s;ed it away to Sir <HI>William Dam&s;ell</HI> emploid as Agent from that Prince to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> and he going out in four Daughters and Coheirs, one of them by matching with <HI>Bur&s;ton</HI> made it upon the di&s;union of the the Body of the E&s;tate into parcels, a Limb of his patrimony; and remained &s;o, until our Fathers remembrance, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Moil</HI> of <HI>Buckwell,</HI> and was not many years &s;ince conveyed by <HI>Robert Moile</HI> E&s;quire, alienated by Sale to Sir <HI>Thomas Finch,</HI> afterwards Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ey,</HI> Father to <HI>Heneage Finch</HI> Earl of <HI>Winchel&s;ey</HI> now Proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Raymonds</HI> is the la&s;t place of Account in <HI>Wye,</HI> which afforded a Seat, and gave a Sirname to a Family &s;o called, and were eminent in this Pari&s;h many hundred years &s;ince, as being Stewards to the Abby of Battle for Lands near this place, and it is probable this place was the original Seminary or Fountain from whence the <HI>Raimonds</HI> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Norfolk,</HI> and other Counties in this Nation, deduced their primitive Ex|traction: But to advance in my di&s;cour&s;e: this Family of <HI>Raymond</HI> having long &s;ince abandoned the Signory of this place, it hath been for &s;undry De&s;cents the Inheritance of <HI>Beck,</HI> and is &s;till entituled to the propriety of one of this Name and Family.</P>

And becau&s;e the Situation of this place was unhealthy, he (to allure Inhabitants) in the year 1366, enobled the Town with a Charter of Incorporation, wherein he indulges by Grant ample priviledges and Immunities unto it, as namely to hold two Mercates weekly, one on the Munday and the other on the Thur&s;day; and two Fairs yearly, one at the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>James,</HI> the other on the twenty fourth of <HI>March,</HI> and to make Choice of Burge&s;&s;es to &s;end to Parlia|ment. The principal Architect and Surveyout of the work, was <HI>William Wickham,</HI> after Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> who had been formerly employed in that kind, at the re|edifying <HI>Wind&s;or-ca&s;tle,</HI> when his good patron <HI>John de Vuedal,</HI> was Con&s;table there. This man u&s;ed to in&s;cribe on the edifices thus erected, this In&s;cription, This made <HI>VVickham,</HI> whereby &s;ome conceived, he arrogated to him&s;elf the Co&s;t and payment of the Structure, and informed the King thereof: but his ingenious expo&s;ition &s;atisfied that Prince, when he &s;hewed him that by his In&s;pection and In&s;ight into tho&s;e matters, he had obtained both his Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular promotions, being made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> fir&s;t Keeper of the privy Seal, and then of the King's Con&s;cience, his la&s;t Gradation or A&s;cent being to be Lord Chancellor of <HI>England.</HI> When King <HI>Edward</HI> had perfected this Ca&s;tle, he in&s;tituted a Chief Governour, who was for the future, to carry the Title of Con&s;table, like as at <HI>Dover-ca&s;tle,</HI> and el&s;ewhere. The Catalogue of tho&s;e who &s;ucceeded in that Command, I have &s;et down. The care and co&s;t of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the year 1536 to repair this place, when he erected Fortre&s;&s;es for Defence of the Sea Coa&s;t, drew this Eulogie from the Pen of <HI>Leland,</HI>

<P><HI>Min&s;ter</HI> is the next place of Account in this I&s;land, and is contracted from the Latin Word <HI>Mona&s;terium,</HI> from whence this Town hath its Appellation, and may chal|lenge the third place among&s;t our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nunneries. For <HI>Sexburga</HI> Daughter to <HI>Ercombert</HI> King of <HI>Kent</HI> (to whom and the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the Church of this Pari&s;h is devoted and dedicated) in the year 664, erected a Religious Hou&s;e at this place, and liberally endowed it, for the Su&s;tentation of vayled Virgins. The &s;econd was founded by <HI>Ean&s;with</HI> Daughter of <HI>Eadbald</HI> King of <HI>Kent,</HI> at <HI>Folkston.</HI> And the fir&s;t had its In&s;titution at <HI>Liminge,</HI> likewi&s;e in this County, by <HI>Eadburga,</HI> and erected to the Honor of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> and St. <HI>Mildred.</HI> But the Antiquity of this Cell, and the Sanctity attributed to it by elder times, could not &s;o skreen or re&s;cue it from the Heat of War, but it was thrice &s;acked and di&s;mantled by the barbarous irruptions of the <HI>Danes,</HI> within le&s;&s;e then an Age, which by u&s;ual Account is &s;aid to be thirty year. The fir&s;t mis|fortune happened to it in the year 832, when thirty five Sail of them rived here and rifled it. The &s;econd and third time, was in the year 851 and then again in the year 855, by the Armies of them who wintered their Ships within this I&s;land. Be&s;ides the&s;e depredations the complices of Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> and his Sons, in the Time of their pro&s;cription and exile, which was in the year 1052, landed in this I&s;land, and mi|&s;erably harra&s;&s;ed it, by filling all places with Ruine and Deva&s;tation. Indeed Reli|gion when it glitters with a &s;plendid and full revenue, is like the Pictures of the an|cient Saints, apparelled in rich Garments, which &s;ome have been enticed to rob, not out of ill Will to their Sanctity, but love to their Shrines, and Beauty of their Cloaths; Per&s;ecution and the Robes of Humility were the Attire of the primitive Church, and when &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed up in gaudy Fortunes, it is no more then &s;he merits: Yet &s;ometimes it occa&s;ions the Devil, to cheat her of her Holine&s;&s;e; and impious men by an unju&s;t and injurious Sacriledge, to cheat her of her riches. But I have digre&s;&s;ed: I now return into the Track of my Di&s;cour&s;e, and mu&s;t inform my Reader, that although the Glory of this Cloi&s;ter, was &s;o bowed down and broken with the&s;e misfortunes, that it appeared almo&s;t &s;unk in its own Calamities: yet by the piety of &s;ub&s;equent Ages, it was buoyed up again: but more e&s;pecially by the indulgent Charity of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, who in the fir&s;t year of his reign confirmed their old priviledges, and to tho&s;e added by patent many new. And in this Condition it
<PB N="381" REF="198">continued untill the general Di&s;&s;olution or Deluge, and then it was by <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in the twenty ninth year of his reign granted to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney:</HI> and his Son <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> having in the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> exchanged it for other Lands with that Prince&s;&s;e; &s;he regranted it to Sir <HI>Edward Hobby,</HI> who had matched with her Kin&s;woman <HI>Margaret,</HI> Daughter of <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Hun&s;don,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>Edward Hobby,</HI> about the middle of King <HI>James</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away to Mr. <HI>Hen. Richards,</HI> and he upon his Decea&s;e bequeathed it to <HI>Gabriel Live&s;ey</HI> E&s;quire; and he, almo&s;t in our Remembrance, conveyed it to Sir <HI>John Heyward,</HI> who &s;etled it upon his two Feoffees in Tru&s;t, Sir <HI>Francis Buller</HI> of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and Serjeant <HI>Clerk</HI> of <HI>Roche|&s;ter,</HI> for &s;uch Charitable U&s;es, as they &s;hould think proportionate to that Convey|ance,</P>
<P>The Mannor of <HI>Northwood,</HI> is &s;ituated in this Pari&s;h, which was the Inheritance of <HI>Jordanus de Scapeia,</HI> for &s;o he is written in old datele&s;&s;e Deeds, and he had I&s;&s;ue <HI>Stephen de Northwood,</HI> who was the fir&s;t whom I find in Record, to have a&s;&s;umed this Appellation, and he was Father to Sir <HI>Roger de Northwood,</HI> who lies buryed in <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> Church, with an In&s;cription affixed to his Monument, which &s;eems by its more mo|dern Character, to have been corrupted; It is this: <HI>Hic jacet Rogerus Northwood, Miles, &s;epultus ante Conque&s;tum.</HI> Indeed his Figure is fairly in&s;culped in Bra&s;&s;e, with that of his Lady <HI>Bona</HI> lying by him, who was Si&s;ter and Heir of <HI>William de Wauton.</HI> The vulgar upon a credulous errour every where affirm, that all tho&s;e who are thus buryed, were enterr'd after the Conque&s;t; when it is certain that many were entom|bed in this po&s;ture, many years before the Conquerour, that had obliged them&s;elves by Vow, to defend the Cro&s;&s;e and Sepulcher of our Saviour, again&s;t the Fury and A&s;&s;aults of Infidels. Sure I am, the Tomb next to this appears to be far more ancient, and of &s;o venerable a Form, that its like doth not occurre in any other place; there is not any Letter of In&s;cription left, only the Coat is a &s;ure Te&s;timony, that it was one of the Ance&s;tors of the Family of <HI>Northwood.</HI> But to proceed: <HI>John Norwood</HI> one of this Hou&s;e, as the private Records of the Family te&s;tifie, fea&s;ted <HI>H.</HI> the fifth, at the <HI>Red Lion</HI> in <HI>Sedingbourne,</HI> and the Wine amounted upon the wole account but to 9. s. and 9. d. Wine being then rated but at a penny the pint. <HI>W. Northwood</HI> another of this Name, and Family, did &s;ignal Service at the Battel of <HI>Agincourt,</HI> and afterwards at the Battel of <HI>Vernoile,</HI> which was managed by <HI>John</HI> Duke of <HI>Bedford,</HI> Regent of <HI>France.</HI> He was Kin&s;man of <HI>John Northwood,</HI> who was the la&s;t of this Name at this place; for he a|bout the latter end of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, alienated it to <HI>VVilliam VVarner</HI> E&s;quire; who&s;e Son and Heir <HI>VVilliam VVarner,</HI> about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, de|mi&s;ed it to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney,</HI> and his Son Sir <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> having exchanged it for other Lands with Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> it remained with the Crown, untill King <HI>James</HI> in the &s;econd year of his reign, granted it to the right honorable <HI>Philip Herbert</HI> Earl of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and afterwards Earl of <HI>Pembroke.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Newhall</HI> is another little Mannor in <HI>Min&s;ter,</HI> which <HI>Fulke Peyforer</HI> dyed &s;ei&s;ed of, in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd; and from him it devolved by de&s;cent to be the pa|trimony of his great Grandchild <HI>Fulk Peyforer,</HI> and his Sole Heir <HI>Julian</HI> carried it a|way to <HI>Thomas St. Leger</HI> of <HI>Ottringden,</HI> who&s;e two Female Coheirs being matched to <HI>Aucher</HI> and <HI>Ewias,</HI> &s;hared his Inheritance, and about the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, pa&s;&s;ed it away by Sale to <HI>Cromer,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or <HI>VVilliam Cromer,</HI> having about the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, by &s;ome mi&s;demeanor, forfeited it to the Crown, it was granted to one <HI>Stephen Graine,</HI> in which Family it remained untill the Begin|ning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it was alienated to <HI>Small;</HI> from which Name, the &s;ame Vici&s;&s;itude not many years &s;ince carried it off to <HI>Luck;</HI> who tran&s;mitted his Right in it to Mr. <HI>Henry Newton,</HI> who hath lately demi&s;ed it to Mr. <HI>Jo&s;ias Gering</HI> of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ri&s;hingdon</HI> is the la&s;t place of Account, which is circum&s;cribed within the Limits of <HI>Min&s;ter.</HI> It was in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, wrapped up in the patrimony of <HI>Savage:</HI> for at that time <HI>John de Savage</HI> obtained a Charter of Free|warrren, to &s;everal of his Mannors in <HI>Kont,</HI> in the Number of which this is regi&s;tered for one; but in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion was departed from this Family, being purcha&s;ed by <HI>Philippa</HI> Wife and Queen to <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and &s;etled upon the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Katharines</HI> neere the <HI>Tower,</HI> in who&s;e demea&s;n it hath layn

<P><HI>Ea&s;t-Church</HI> is the next place which comes to be con&s;idered: Which though ob|&s;cure in it &s;elf, yet is made eminent by <HI>Shurland,</HI> which is a Limb of this Pari&s;h, and anciently did own a noble Family which bore that Sirname; the la&s;t of which was Sir <HI>Robert de Shurland,</HI> who was one of tho&s;e <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Bannerets, which were made by King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and to whom the former Prince, as a farther Symbol or Te&s;timony of his Merit, granted a Charter of Free-warren in the twenty ninth year of his reign, to his Mannor of <HI>Shurland:</HI> not long after which he decea&s;ed, and lies entombed under an Arch in the Southwall, with his pourtraicture in&s;culped in a Marble, in <HI>Min&s;ter</HI> Church, who&s;e Tomb is become the Scene of much Fal&s;hood and popular errour; the vulgar having digged out of his Vault, many wild Legends and Roman|ces, as namely that he buryed a Prie&s;t alive, that he &s;wam on his hor&s;e two miles thorough the Sea, to the King, who was then neer this I&s;land on Shipboard, to pur|cha&s;e his pardon; and having obtained it, &s;wam back to the Shore: where being arrived, he cut off the head of his &s;aid Hor&s;e, becau&s;e it was affirmed, he had acted this by Magick: and that riding on hunting a twelvemoneth after, his hor&s;e &s;tumbled and threw him on the Scull of his former Hor&s;e, which blow &s;o brui&s;ed him, that from that Contu&s;ion he contracted an inward impo&s;tumation, of which he dyed; and in memory of which, an Hor&s;e Head is placed at his Feet; which fictitious Story, is rent into the di&s;union of &s;o many ab&s;urd circum&s;tances, that I &s;hall repre&s;ent to the Reader, the Founda|tion on which this fabulous Natrative was formerly e&s;tabli&s;hed, which is no more but this. Sir <HI>Robert de Shurland</HI> above-mentioned, being Lord Warden of the Cinque|ports, and a man of eminent Authority under <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, obtained Grant of pri|viledge by Charter, to have wrack of Sea upon his Lands confining on the Sea Shore, neere <HI>Shurland:</HI> now the extent of this Royaltie is evermore e&s;teemed to reach as far into the Water, upon a low ebb, as a man can ride in, and touch any thing with the point of his Launce, and &s;o you have the explication of this marvel; and the cou|ching either of whole Creatures, or part of them, at the Feet of worthy per&s;onages, is mo&s;t frequent both now and in elder Times, that the&s;e inanimate Repre&s;entations might be the Symbols or Hieroglyphicks, to intimate to po&s;terity tho&s;e Virtues which were re&s;ident in them when alive. But to proceed: the abovementioned Sir <HI>Robert de Shurland,</HI> having improved his Reputation with many noble and worthy Actions, left That only to perpetuate his Name to po&s;terity, having no I&s;&s;ue-male to continue it: for he left only one Daughter and Heir, matched to <HI>W. de Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Patricksbourn Cheyney,</HI> who was &s;on and heir to Sir <HI>Alexander de Cheyney,</HI> who is in the Inventory or Li&s;t of tho&s;e Knights Bannerets, who were ennobled with that Dignity, by <HI>E.</HI> the fir&s;t, at the Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> in the twenty eighth year of his reign, and in Right of this Match, dyed po&s;&s;e&s;t of it, in the eighth year of <HI>E.</HI> the third, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 58. And from him did it come down to his great Grandchild, Sir <HI>John Cheyney</HI> who was Knight of the Garter, and frequently Knight of this Shire, in &s;undry Parliaments, under the Government of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the fir&s;t year of who&s;e reign, as our Chronicles inform us, he was &s;ent Emba&s;&s;ador to &s;everal forreign Princes, to repre&s;ent to them the Rea&s;ons or Motives which induced him to a&s;&s;ume the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Diadem, and in the fir&s;t and &s;econd year of that Prince, he was cho&s;en Speaker of Parliament. Sir <HI>William Cheyney</HI> another of this Family of <HI>Shurland,</HI> was fir&s;t a Judge, and &s;econdly Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Kings Bench, in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth: but the greate&s;t Honour this Mannor atchieved, was when it came to be po&s;&s;e&s;t by Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney</HI> who was Knight of the Garter, Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports, Con&s;table of <HI>Quinborough</HI> Ca&s;tle, and one of the Privy Councel to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and he had I&s;&s;ue Sir <HI>Henry Cheyney,</HI> created <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney</HI> of <HI>Tuddington</HI> by Queen <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> who having exchanged this Mannor of <HI>Shurland</HI> with that Prince&s;&s;e, it remai|ned with the patrimony of the Crown, untill the &s;econd year of King <HI>James;</HI> and then it was by royal Conce&s;&s;ion from that Prince, made the Inheritance of <HI>Philip</HI> Earl
<PB N="383" REF="199">of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and after of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> upon who&s;e late decea&s;e it is now come to con|fe&s;&s;e the Signory of his &s;econd Son Mr. <HI>James Herbert.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Kingsborough</HI> is another Mannor in this Pari&s;h, who&s;e Name tacitly intimates to us, that it was involved formerly in the Revenue of the Crown, and was the place which the Inhabitants frequented, not only for the holding of a Court, for the choice and election of the Con&s;tables of the I&s;land: but likewi&s;e here a&s;&s;embled to nomi|nate and appoint tho&s;e Wardens or Bailiffs, that were to take Cogni&s;ance or Charge of the pa&s;&s;age called <HI>King ferry;</HI> which divides the I&s;land, and the main Land of me County; this Mannor after it had for many Generations layn folded up in the royal Demea&s;ne, was by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> granted to Mr. <HI>Henry Cary;</HI> who about the Be|ginning of K. <HI>James,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Swaleman,</HI> who&s;e De&s;cendant is &s;till entituled to the propriety of it.</P>
<P><HI>Lei&s;don</HI> next offers it &s;elfe up to our view, which was parcel of that e&s;tate which acknowledged the noble and ancient Family of <HI>Grey</HI> or <HI>Rotherfield</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> for its an|cient Owners, The fir&s;t which made this Family eminent was <HI>John de Grey,</HI> who was frequently &s;ummoned to &s;it in Parliament as Baron, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and dyed po&s;&s;e&s;t of this Mannor in the thirty third year of that Prince, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 38. And &s;o did <HI>Robert Grey</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or, in the &s;econd year of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth. After his <HI>Exit,</HI> I do not find it long con&s;tant to the Signory of this Name: for about the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth it was alienated to <HI>Lovell;</HI> and by virtue of this pur|cha&s;e, Sir <HI>William Lovell</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the twenty third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth. After this Family had abandoned the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Cheyneys</HI> of <HI>Shurland</HI> were by purcha&s;e planted in the Inheritance, and remained &s;etled in the Fee-&s;imple of it, untill Sir <HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Cheyney,</HI> exchanged it with Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nuts</HI> called &s;o vulgarly, but in the ancient Court-rolls named <HI>Notts,</HI> as being the Inheritance of a Family called <HI>Nott,</HI> is a little Mannor in <HI>Lei&s;don,</HI> which after it had for many de&s;cents acknowledged no other proprietaries, but this Family, about the Beginning of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, was rent from them by purcha&s;e, and tran&s;planted into <HI>Bartholomew,</HI> a Family which were Owners anciently of much Land about <HI>Ling|&s;ted, Throuley,</HI> and other places in that Track, and continued Ma&s;ters of this Lord&s;hip, untill the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then it was conveyed to Sir <HI>Thomas Cheyney;</HI> who&s;e Son Sir <HI>Henry Cheyney</HI> about the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> a Family which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of <HI>Samp&s;on-court,</HI> not far di&s;tant many hundred years; and were de&s;cended from <HI>William Samp&s;on,</HI> who was frequently &s;um|moned to &s;it in Parliament as Baron in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t.

<P><HI>Werdon</HI> is the la&s;t place of Account in this I&s;land; It was in times of an elder In|&s;cription involved in the Inheritance of <HI>Savage</HI> of <HI>Bobbing,</HI> and in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, Sir <HI>John de Savage</HI> obtained a Charter of Free-warren to his Mannor of <HI>Werdon:</HI> But before the middle of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, this Family had &s;urrendered their Intere&s;t here to <HI>Fremingham;</HI> for <HI>John de Fremingham</HI> dyed &s;ei&s;ed of it, in the twenty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third: but whether it devolved with other Land by the Heir general of <HI>Fremingham</HI> to <HI>I&s;ley</HI> or not, is incertain, becau&s;e tho&s;e privtae evidences which relate to this Mannor, extend no higher then the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth; and then I find the propriety of it in <HI>Norton,</HI> in which Family after the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion had re&s;ided untill our times, it was conveyed to <HI>Edmund Tooke</HI> of <HI>Dartford</HI> Esq; Barri&s;ter at Law, now proprietary of it.</P>
<P><HI>Thanet</HI> lies, if not all, yet mo&s;t part of it, circum&s;cribed within the Hundred of <HI>Ringle&s;low:</HI> It is &s;tyled in Greek by ancient Authors <GAP DESC="foreign">, in Latine <HI>Thanetum,</HI> and in the Saxon it is curtailed into <HI>Thanet,</HI> which an old Manu&s;cript which I have &s;een, de|duces from two Saxon Words <HI>Thane</HI> and <HI>Yete,</HI> which in that Language then implyed as much as the Lords-Entrance: but for my particular, I believe that the Saxons, when upon the Donation of it to them by <HI>Vortiger,</HI> they fir&s;t entered into this I&s;land, fin|ding that <HI>Thanetum</HI> was a Latine Name impo&s;ed upon it by the Romans, who had but newly then de&s;erted the Protection of this I&s;land, new-&s;oftned the Name by contra|cting
<PB N="384" REF="200">it, and then quilted it into the Alphabet of their own Language, and called it <HI>Thanett;</HI> and that this is probable, I &s;hall evince from circum&s;tances, <HI>Punio</HI> in La|tine &s;ignifies to puni&s;h, from whence the <HI>Saxons</HI> &s;tyled that place by <HI>Maid&s;tone,</HI> where they puni&s;hed Malefactors <HI>Pinandun Hoath:</HI> So <HI>Ca&s;trum</HI> was a Name u&s;ed by the Ro|mans to &s;ignifie or expre&s;&s;e any Ca&s;tle or Fortre&s;&s;e, which the <HI>Saxons</HI> upon their ad|mi&s;&s;ion into this I&s;land, finding it to be impo&s;ed upon all places of &s;trength and im|portance, adopted it into their Dialect, and from the word <HI>Ca&s;trum</HI> extracted the word <HI>Cea&s;ter.</HI> I could in&s;tance in many other particulars, but that I &s;hould both weary my Reader, and clog this Di&s;cour&s;e with Superfluities: I &s;hall therefore from the untwi|&s;ting the Name, de&s;cend to the De&s;cription of the I&s;land.</P>
<P><HI>Serre,</HI> now vulgarly called <HI>Sarre,</HI> is the fir&s;t place of Note which offers it &s;elf up to a view: It was anciently a Pari&s;h, untill peradventure the unhealthine&s;&s;e of the Soile; for it now confines upon Mari&s;hes (where formerly glided that Gullet of Sea-water, now wholly &s;tifled with Sand) which made <HI>Thanett</HI> an I&s;land, as may plainly appear by an ancient Mapp, printed by the original, and now extant in the Book called <HI>Mona&s;ti|cum Anglicanum</HI>) or el&s;e from the in&s;alubrity of the Air, which being polluted with tho&s;e black and foggie vapours which a&s;cend from a loo&s;e and &s;oggie earth, very fre|quently leave a venomous Tincture upon the Blood and Spirits of tho&s;e Inhabitants, who are &s;ubject to the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;uch pernicious exhalations, forced tho&s;e who dwelt in <HI>Serre,</HI> to abandon &s;o &s;ickly a Habitation; and &s;o the Pari&s;h by degrees, began to langui&s;h away into that Solitude, we &s;ee it is &s;hrunk into at pre&s;ent. The Church was dedicated to St. <HI>Giles,</HI> but at pre&s;ent lies entombed in &s;uch forgotten Ruines, that &s;carce the lea&s;t Remains are vi&s;ible. The Mannor it &s;elf was one of the ancient Seats of the noble Family of <HI>Crioll. Bertram de Crioll</HI> augments the Regi&s;ter of tho&s;e <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, who were with <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t at the Siege of <HI>Acon</HI> in <HI>Pale&s;tine. Bartho|lomew de Crioll</HI> another of this Name and Family, was Lieutenant of <HI>Dover-ca&s;tle</HI> under the above&s;aid Prince. <HI>Simon de Crioll</HI> was with <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, at his pro&s;perous Siege of <HI>Carlaverock,</HI> and for his generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance there, received the Order of Knight|hood, and from him it came down to Sir <HI>William Crioll,</HI> Father to Sir <HI>John Crioll</HI> who held it in the Beginning of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, as appears <HI>Pat.</HI> 9. <HI>Hen.</HI> 6. <HI>Par. prim. Memb.</HI> 19. And from him was it tran&s;mitted to his Son Sir <HI>Thomas Keriell,</HI> Knight of the Garter, a Man of that worth and eminence, in that time he lived in, that I might &s;eem &s;omething to ob&s;cure his Glory, if I &s;hould not repre&s;ent to the Reader, &s;ome of tho&s;e honorable Atchievements, which he performed in <HI>France,</HI> the Relation of which I have omitted in my De&s;cription of <HI>Stockbury</HI> and <HI>Walmer.</HI> In the ninth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, he being Governour of <HI>Gourney</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> i&s;&s;uedout of that place, and hara&s;&s;ed not only that Province, but fought with the Earl of <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> who was &s;ent to oppo&s;e his Eruptions, and after a &s;harp Combat gave him a remark|able di&s;comfiture, killing about &s;ix hundred, and captivating two hundred Soldiers. In the fifteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, he &s;ei&s;ed upon the Duke of <HI>Burgundie's</HI> Carriages and Cannons leaving <HI>Cretoy</HI> (a Fortre&s;&s;e then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and not long before di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the above&s;aid Duke) furni&s;hed with victual for &s;ix hundred men, for the &s;pace of a twelvemonth. And la&s;tly in the twenty &s;eventh year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, he was &s;ent over into <HI>France,</HI> with a &s;upply of 1500 men to recruit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, where he did as much with &s;o &s;mall a quantity of men, as could be expected from humane Courage, and having reduced &s;ome pieces of &s;trength, he encountered the Earl of <HI>Clermont</HI> at a place called <HI>Formigney,</HI> where being overlaid with Multitude, after he had given mo&s;t &s;ignal Te&s;timony of his valour, and di&s;charged all tho&s;e duties which might have &s;ecured and pre&s;erved the Honor of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, and the Glory of the day, by which he declared him&s;elf to be not only a prudent Man, but an expert Commander, he was defeated: But to proceed, after the Family of <HI>Crioll</HI> went out from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this place, which was before the latter end of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, <HI>John White</HI> E&s;quire, became Lord of the Fee, and held it at his Death, which was in the ninth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth: but after his Decea&s;e it was not long re|&s;ident in this Name: for in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, I find it the Inheritance of <HI>Bere,</HI> and was fixed in this Family, untill the Beginning of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> and then it was pa&s;&s;ed away by Sale to <HI>Ru&s;h,</HI> ance&s;tor to Sir <HI>Fran|cis Ru&s;h,</HI> who not many years &s;ince concluding in two Daughters and Coheirs, one of

<P><HI>Downebarton</HI> is the next place which occurs, and challenges our Survey. There was a Family Sirnamed <HI>Exeter,</HI> that had large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions at or neer this place, and were planted in the Tenure of them many Centuries of years: In the fourth year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, <HI>Margaret</HI> Widow of <HI>John Exeter,</HI> held Lands at <HI>Downebarton</HI> in Right of Dower, as appears by an Inqui&s;ition taken after her death, which commences from that time. But the principal Honor this place anciently recieved, was, that it was a Mannor which fell under the Signory of the Arch-bi&s;hops of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> as is mani|fe&s;t by an Inqui&s;ition taken in the twenty fir&s;t of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot. E&s;c. Num.</HI> 7. Which repre&s;ents to po&s;terity what Lands and Mannors <HI>Thomas</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> held at that time; nor did it depart from the revenue of this Sea, until the 29. year of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; and then being exchanged with the Crown by <HI>Tho. Cran|mer</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> it was granted away to <HI>Henry Cri&s;pe</HI> E&s;quire; in which Family it was fixed untill tho&s;e times which were circum&s;cribed within the Verge of our Fathers Remembrance, and then it was conveyed to <HI>Paramour,</HI> from which Name not many years &s;ince, the vici&s;&s;itude of purcha&s;e carried it away, and hath now made it part of the demea&s;n of <HI>Daniel Harvey</HI> of <HI>Combe-nevill,</HI> in <HI>King&s;ton</HI> upon <HI>Thames</HI> E&s;quire.</P>
<P><HI>Quekes</HI> in <HI>Birchington</HI> was the ancient Seat of an ancient Family which bore that Sir|name, and after it had for many de&s;cents acknowledged it &s;elf to have related to that Name, it devolved by paternal de&s;cent to <HI>John Quekes,</HI> who about the Beginning of <HI>H.</HI> the &s;eventh, expired in a Daughter and Heir who was matched to....<HI>Cri&s;pe,</HI> extra|cted from the <HI>Cri&s;pes</HI> of <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI> who had flouri&s;hed there many Generations before, (as appears by an old pedigree now in the hands of Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe</HI> of <HI>London</HI>) under the Notion of Gentlemen of the be&s;t Rank; nor did this Family wither by being thus tran&s;planted, and inoculated upon a forraign Stem, but rather did gather new Sap and Verdure, which made it &s;o exceedingly &s;prout forth, that <HI>Henry Cri&s;pe</HI> E&s;quire, who was Sheriff of <HI>Kent</HI> in the thirty eighth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, and was afterwards honoured with Knighthood, did &s;hoot up to that power, and grew &s;o tall in Title, that he was in the dialect of tho&s;e Times called <HI>Regulus In&s;ulae,</HI> or the Governour of the I&s;le of <HI>Thannet;</HI> and from this worthy per&s;on, is <HI>Henry Cri&s;pe</HI> E&s;quire, Heir to Sir <HI>Henry Cri&s;pe</HI> not long &s;ince decea&s;ed, and now proprietary of <HI>Quekes,</HI> originally de|&s;cended.</P>
<P><HI>We&s;t-gate</HI> in <HI>Birchington</HI> was wrapped up in that va&s;t demea&s;n which was entituled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the noble and powerful Family of <HI>Leybourn</HI> of <HI>Leybourn</HI>-ca&s;tle. <HI>Will. de Leybourn</HI> Son of <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> held it at his Death, which was in the third year of <HI>Ed.</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Rot.

And left it to <HI>Roger de Leybourn,</HI> from whom with the re&s;t of his diffu&s;ed patrimony in this County, it came to his only Daughter and Heir <HI>Juliana de Leybourn,</HI> fir&s;t matched to <HI>Iohn de Ha&s;tings,</HI> Brother or Kin&s;man to <HI>Laurence de Ha&s;tings</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and then to <HI>William de Clinton</HI> Earl of <HI>Hunting|don,</HI> but &s;urvived them both, and dying without I&s;&s;ue in the forty third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, &s;he made God her Heir to this Mannor, and gave it to the Abby of St. <HI>Au|gu&s;tins,</HI> and in the patrimony of that Cloi&s;ter did the Title of this Mannor lie locked up, untill the general Di&s;&s;olution in the reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, unloo&s;ened it, and then linked it again by a new Augmentation to the demea&s;n of the Crown; and then the above&s;aid Prince, in the thirty fifth year of his reign, granted it to Sir <HI>Tho. Moile,</HI> who not long after pa&s;&s;ed it away to <HI>Bere,</HI> a Family of good account in this I&s;land, as being de&s;cended from <HI>Richard de Bere,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Recognitores magnae A&s;&s;i&s;ae</HI> for <HI>Kent,</HI> in the &s;econd year of King <HI>John,</HI> as appears by the Pipe-roll of that time; and from this Name about the latter end of Q. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> did it by purcha&s;e come over to <HI>Denne</HI> of <HI>Denne-hill</HI> in <HI>King&s;ton,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or Mr. <HI>Thomas Denne</HI> of <HI>Denne-hill,</HI> Reader formerly of the Middle-Temple, and Recorder of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> dying lately without I&s;&s;ue-male, his four Daughters (<HI>Thomazin</HI> married to Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe, Bridget</HI> matched to Sir <HI>Iohn Darrell</HI> of <HI>Calehill, Dorothy</HI> wedded to Mr. <HI>Roger Lucan,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed to <HI>Vincent Denne</HI> E&s;quire) became his Coheirs, and and this upon the divi&s;ion of his E&s;tate, augmented the patrimony of Sir <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;pe.</HI></P>
