<P>COllonel Pride is here, and hath three parties of foot coming hither to be tran&s;|ported for Ireland, and I believe they will be about a thou&s;and men, and then the&s;e with three companies of Colonell Moors, and three com|panies of colonel Fenwicks, wil make a con&s;i|derable body: Captain Clarke, captain of the &s;wan frigot that went convoy for Derry, is come back and put into Heland, and writes me
<PB N="5" REF="4">thence &s;ome relation he hath heard from &s;cot|land, that eight great &s;hips &s;hould be arrived there, and that colonell King, collonel Iohn&s;on. others are landed, and &s;ixty &s;ail of &s;hips with &s;ouldiers, of all which I believe little or no part of it; for I have a Nephew that went over with captain Clark to London-Derry, who &s;ent me a letter, wherein he writes not one word of it. This is all I will trouble you at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>I hope your di&s;tractions are at a period, and if &s;o, I doubt not but by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, in
<PB N="6" REF="5">ear longer the adver&s;aries boa&s;ting &s;pirits will be quieted. We are now treating with Waterford, and in a &s;hort time I hope to give you a good account of it: many of our Officers are dead. That arch &s;ea Pirate, captain Plun|ket was taken, with two prizes, but him&s;elf e|&s;caped in a long boat, his &s;hip had thirty &s;ix piece of Ordnance, and came into our harbour before he was aware, three pri&s;es more were ta|ken in the River near Duncannon, before we withdraw our Army thence.</P>
