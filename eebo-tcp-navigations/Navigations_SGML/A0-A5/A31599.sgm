<HEAD><HI>Angliae Notitia,</HI> OR THE PRESENT STATE OF ENGLAND: <HI>The Second Part.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Government of <HI>England</HI> in particular; and Fir&s;t of the Kings mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council.</HEAD>
<P>THe Government of <HI>England,</HI> in particular is either <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, Civil</HI> or <HI>Military,</HI> where|in the King is &s;upreme Gover|nour in all Cau&s;es and over all Per&s;ons; from him is derived all Au|thority and Jurisdiction. He is <HI>qua&s;i In|tellectus Agens, Forma formarum, vel potius Mundi Anglici Deus,</HI> And the <HI>Pri|mum
<PB N="2" REF="13">
Mobile</HI> thereof, from whence all the Inferiour Orbes derive their Motion, is that Noble Honourable and Reverend A&s;|&s;embly called <HI>Concilium &s;ecretum, Priva|tum vel Continuum Regis Concilium,</HI> which is a Court of &s;uch Antiquity and Honour that it may be &s;aid to be higher then the highe&s;t Court of <HI>England</HI> (as the Parlia|ment is u&s;ually called) for our Parlia|ments are not only much younger, but al|&s;o may truly be &s;aid to be the Productions of the Kings Privy Council as appears by the words of the Writ for &s;ummoning of a Parliament. This is the highe&s;t watch Tower of the Nation, wherein the King with all his good Centinels and Watch|men about him takes a careful &s;urvey of all his Dominions, and &s;ometimes of all the Domininons of the World as any of them have any Relation to his, where he Con&s;ults and Contrives how to protect his numberle&s;s Subjects, not onley from Injuries among&s;t them&s;elves, but from the wrongs and violences of all other Nations, where he doth con&s;ult and watch for the publick good, Honour, Defence, Profit, and Peace of all his people.</P>
<P>Before the later end of <HI>Henry</HI> the Third. <HI>Quod provi&s;um fuit per Regem &amp; Concili|um &s;uum Privatum &s;igilloque Regis confir|matum proculdubio legis vigorem habuit,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Spelman.</HI></P>
<P>The Primitive and ordinary way of Go|vernment in <HI>England,</HI> was by the King and and his Privy Council, and all our Kings
<PB N="3" REF="13">
have acted much by it, determining Contro|ver&s;ies of great importance, &s;oemtimes touching Lands and Rights between party and party, whereof there are very many Pre|cedents, and the Judges of <HI>England</HI> in &s;ome difficult ca&s;es were not wont to give Judgment, until they had fir&s;t con&s;ulted the King or his Privy Council. Moreover the Lords and Commons a&s;&s;embled in Par|liament, have oft-times tran&s;mitted mat|ters of high moment to the King and his Privy Council, as by long experience and wi&s;dom better able to judge of, and by &s;ecrecy and expedition better able to tran&s;|act &s;ome State Affairs, then all the Lords and Commons together.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, the King and his Privy Council take Cogni&s;ance of few matters that may well be determined by the known Laws and ordinary Courts of Ju&s;tice, but onely, as afore&s;aid, con&s;ult for the Pub|lick Good, Honour, Defence, Safety, and Benefit of the Realm, not medling with matters that concern Freeholds, but mat|ters of Appeal and &s;udden Emergencies.</P>
<P>The Lords of the Privy Council are as it were a part of the King, incorporate with him and his Cares, bearing upon their Shoulders that great weight, that otherwi&s;e would lye wholly upon His Ma|je&s;ty, wherefore of &s;uch high value and e&s;teem they have always been, that if a man did but &s;trike in the Hou&s;e of a Privy Coun&s;ellor, or el&s;ewhere in his pre&s;ence, he was grievou&s;ly Fined for the &s;ame,
<PB N="4" REF="14">
and to con&s;pire the death of any of them was made Felony, in any of the Kings &s;er|vants within the <HI>Check Roll,</HI> and to kill one of them was High Trea&s;on.</P>
<P>A Privy Councellor, though but a Gentleman, &s;hall have precedence of all Knights, Baronets, and younger Sons of all Barons and Vi&s;counts.</P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of their Oath is, That they &s;hall according to their power and di&s;cretion, Truly, Ju&s;tly, and Evenly, Coun&s;el and Advi&s;e the King, in all mat|ters to be Treated in His Maje&s;ties Coun|cil, that they &s;hall keep &s;ecret the Kings Coun&s;el, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>By Force of this Oath, and the Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> a Privy Coun&s;ellor is made without any Patent or Grant, and to continue onely during the Life of the King that makes him, nor &s;o long unle&s;s the King plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>Heretofore there hath been u&s;ually a Lord Pre&s;ident of the Kings Privy Coun|cil, a Dignity of &s;o high Repute, that by a Statute of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, he is to take place in publick, next to the Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>England:</HI> His Office was to &s;peak fir&s;t to bu&s;ine&s;s, to report to His Maje&s;ty the Pa&s;&s;ages and State of bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es tran&s;acted at Council Table. The la&s;t Lord Pre&s;ident was the Earl of <HI>Man|che&s;ter,</HI> Father of the pre&s;ent Lord Cham|berlaine.</P>
<P>To his Privy Councellors the King of <HI>England,</HI> may declare or con|ceal
<PB N="5" REF="14">
from them what&s;oever he alone judgeth fit and expedient, <HI>qua in re</HI> (&s;aith the Excel|lent Sir <HI>Tho. Smith) ab&s;olutis&s;imum e&s;t hoc Regnum Angliae prae Venetorum Ducatu aut Lacedaemoniorum Principatu.</HI></P>
<P>The King with the advice of his Privy Council doth publi&s;h Proclamations bin|ding to the Subject, provided that they are not contrary to Statute or Common Law.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es where the publick peace ho|nour or profit of the Kingdom may be en|dangered for want of &s;peedy redre&s;s, there the King with his Privy Council u&s;ually make u&s;e of an ab&s;olute power if need be.</P>
<P>The Members of this mo&s;t Honorable Council are &s;uch as his own free Will and meer Motion &s;hall plea&s;e to choo&s;e, and are commonly men of the highe&s;t rank, eminent for E&s;tates, Wi&s;dom, Courage, Integrity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And becau&s;e there are few ca&s;es of moment &s;o temporal, but that they may &s;ome way relate to &s;piritual af|fairs, therefore according to the general Rules of Policy and Government, which God him&s;elf ordained among&s;t his cho&s;en people the Jews, the Privy Council (as well as the great Council of Parliament) is compo&s;ed of Spiritual as well as Tem|poral per&s;ons, &s;ome of the principal Bi&s;hops of <HI>England</HI> have in all times been cho&s;en by His Maje&s;ty to be of his Privy Coun|cil.</P>

<P>The&s;e are all to wait on his Maje&s;ty, and at Council Board &s;it in their Order, bare-headed when His Maje&s;ty pre&s;ides.</P>
<P>At all Debates the lowe&s;t delivers his opinion fir&s;t, that &s;o he may be the more free, and the King la&s;t of all declares his Judgment, and thereby determines the mater in Debate.</P>
<P>The Time and Place of holding this Council is wholly at the Kings plea&s;ure, but it is mo&s;t commonly held in the mor|ning
<PB N="9" REF="16">
on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI> out of Par|liament time and Term time, and in the Afternoon, in time of Parliament and Term.</P>
<P>A Council is &s;eldom or never held with|out the Pre&s;ence of one of the Secretaries of State, of who&s;e Office and Dignity much more con&s;iderable in <HI>England</HI> than in other Nations, take here this brief Ac|count.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>England</HI> had antiently but one Secretary of State, until about the end of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight his Reign, it was thought fit, that weighty and important Office &s;hould be di&s;charged by two Per|&s;ons, both of equal authority, and both &s;tiled <HI>Principal Secretaries of State</HI> In tho&s;e days, and &s;ome while after, they &s;ate not at Council Board, but having prepared their bu&s;ine&s;s in a Room adjoyning to the Council-Chamber, they came in, and &s;tood on either hand of the King; and no|thing was debated at the Table, until the Secretaries had gone through with their Propo&s;als. But Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> &s;eldom coming to Council, that Method was al|tered, and the two Secretaries took their places as Privy Coun&s;ellors; which Dig|nity they have retained and enjoyed ever &s;ince&punc; and a Council is &s;eldom or never held without the pre&s;ence of one of them at the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>Their employment being of extraordi|nary tru&s;t and multiplicity, renders them mo&s;t con&s;iderable both in the eyes of the
<PB N="10" REF="17">
King, upon whom they attend every day as occa&s;ion requires; and of the Subjects al&s;o, who&s;e reque&s;ts and de&s;ires are for the mo&s;t part lodged in their hands, to be pre&s;ented to the King, and always to make di&s;|patches thereupon, according to His Ma|je&s;ties An&s;wers and Directions.</P>
<P>As for Forraign Affairs, the Secreta|ries divide all the Kingdoms and Nations, which have intercour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s with the King of <HI>England,</HI> into two grand Provin|ces, whereof each Secretary taketh one to him&s;elf, receiving all Letters and Ad|dre&s;&s;es from, and making all di&s;patches to, the &s;everal Princes and States compre|hended within his own Province.</P>
<P>But in all matters of home concern, whether they relate to the Publick, or to particular per&s;ons, both the Secretaries do equally and indi&s;tinctly receive and di&s;|patch what&s;oever is brought to them, be it for the Church, the Militia, or private Grants, Pardons, Di&s;pen&s;ations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>They have this &s;pecial Honour, that if either of them be a Baron, he taketh place, and hath the precedence of all other per|&s;ons of the &s;ame degree, though otherwi&s;e by their Creation &s;ome of them might have right to precede him; and a Knight in like manner, if he hath no other qualificati|on.</P>
<P>They have their &s;everal Lodgings ap|pointed them in all the Kings Hou&s;es, as well for their own Accommodation, as for their Office, and tho&s;e that attend up|on
<PB N="11" REF="17">
it. They have al&s;o a very liberal Diet at the Kings charge, or Board-wages in lieu of it.</P>
<P>To &s;hew how con&s;iderable their place is, their &s;etled allowance from the King in Sa|lary and Pen&s;ion is little le&s;s than Two thou&s;and pounds <HI>Sterling per annum,</HI> to each of them.</P>
<P>The Secretaries and Clerks whom they imploy under them are wholly at their own choice, and have no dependance upon any other power or per&s;on be&s;ides them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They have the Cu&s;tody of that Seal of the King, which is properly called the <HI>Sig|net</HI>; the u&s;e and application whereof, gives denomination to an Office con&s;tantly atten|ding the Court called the <HI>Signet Office,</HI> wherein there are four Clerks, who wait alternately by Months, and prepare &s;uch things as are to pa&s;s the Signet in order to the Privy Seal or Great Seal.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Secretaries of State are,</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> Lord <HI>Arlington,</HI> whom for his eminent Services at home and abroad, both in War and Peace, His Maje&s;ty was plea|&s;ed to advance into the place of Sir <HI>Ed|ward Nicholas.</HI></P>
<P>And Sir <HI>John Trevor,</HI> who for his great abilities and &s;uccesful Negotiations had that Tru&s;t and Honour conferred upon him, when Sir <HI>William Morice,</HI> late Secretary of State, was by His Maje&s;ties gracious con&s;ent permitted to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Waiting on the Privy Council there are Four Clarks in Ordinary, who waite by
<PB N="12" REF="18">
Months each one, he that comes in, is al|ways a week before and a week after his Month to a&s;&s;i&s;t there.</P>
<P>Their Office is to read what is brought before the Council and draw up all &s;uch Orders as the King and Lords &s;hall direct, and cau&s;e them to be Regi&s;tred.</P>
<P><HI>They are the&s;e that follow.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Richard Brown,</HI> Sir <HI>Edward Walker,</HI> Sir <HI>John Nicolas,</HI> Sir <HI>Robert Southwel</HI>; Salaries to each 250. <HI>l.</HI> be&s;ides Fees for Or|ders and Letters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ide the forenamed Officers there is a Keeper of the Records, <HI>John Woolly</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> no Fee.</P>
<P>Two Keepers of the Council Chamber, Fee to each 45 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Thirty Me&s;&s;engers, whereof Ten at a time by turns waite every Moneth, Fee to each 45 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e upon Occa&s;ion are &s;ent by War|rant of the Lords of the Privy Council to fetch any Per&s;on, under the Degree of a Baron, and to keep him Pri&s;oner in his Hou&s;e till farther order.</P>
<P>Attending on the Secretaries are the Clerks of the <HI>Signet,</HI> or <HI>Little Seal,</HI> which is always in the Cu&s;tody of the Secretaries, for &s;ealing the Kings Private Letters and for all &s;uch Grants as pa&s;s His Maje&s;ties hands by Bill a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e Clerks there are four, Sir <HI>John Nicholas</HI> Knight of the Bath, Sir <HI>Philip
<PB N="13" REF="18">
Warwick</HI> Knight, <HI>Trumbal</HI> E&s;|quire, and <HI>Sidney Bear</HI> E&s;quire. The&s;e have no Fee from the King, but onely Dy|et, which at Pen&s;ion is 200 <HI>l.</HI> yearly. Their Office is in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> they waite by Month, each of them three Months in a year. One of them alwayes attends the Court where|&s;oever it removes, and by Warrant from the King, or Secretaries of State, or Lords of the Council, prepare &s;uch Bills or Let|ters for the King to &s;ign, as not being mat|ters of Law are by any Warrants directed to them to prepare. In their Office, all Grants either prepared by the Kings lear|ned Council in the Law, or by them&s;elves, for the Kings hand, when &s;igned are re|turned and there tran&s;cribed again, and that tran&s;cription is carried to one of the Principal Secretaries of State, and Sealed, and then it is called a Signet, which is directed to the Lord Privy Seal, and is his Warrant for i&s;&s;uing out a Privy Seal upon it, which is prepared by the Clerks of that Seal, is &s;ufficient for the payment of any Moneys out of the Exchequer and for &s;everal other u&s;es: but when the nature of the Grant requires the pa&s;&s;ing the Great Seal, then the Privy Seal is an Authority to the Lord Keeper to pa&s;s the Great Seal, as the Signet was to the Lord Privy Seal to affix that Seal to the Grant, but in all three Offices, <HI>viz.</HI> Signet, Privy-Seal and Great-Seal, the Grant is tran&s;cribed. So all which pa&s;&s;es from the King hath the&s;e &s;everal ways of being con&s;idered before per|fected.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="19">There are al&s;o four Clarks of the Privy Seal, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lord <HI>Sandwich,</HI> who&s;e Intere&s;t for his life is in one Mr <HI>Watkins</HI>; Mr <HI>Baron,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Bicker&s;taff,</HI> and Mr. &mdash;</P>

<P>To this Office (in time when the Court of <HI>Reque&s;t</HI> is in being) belongs the Sealing of all Commi&s;&s;ions, and other proce&s;s out of that Court.</P>
<P>Moreover depending on the Secretaries of State, is an antient Office called the Pa|per-Office, the Keeper whereof hath in his Charge, all the publick Papers, Writings, Matters of State, and Coun|&s;el, all Letters, Intelligences, Negotiati|ons of the Kings publick Mini&s;ters abroad, and generally all the Papers and di&s;patch|es that pa&s;s through the Offices of the two Secretaries of State, which are from time to time tran&s;mitted into this Office, and here remain, di&s;po&s;ed by way of a Libra|ry within His Maje&s;ties Palace of <HI>White|hall.</HI> This con&s;iderable Officer hath a Fee of 160 <HI>l. per annum</HI> payable out of the Exchequer, and is at pre&s;ent that very wor|thy per&s;on <HI>Jo&s;eph William&s;on,</HI> Doctor of Laws.</P>

<P>IN the Government of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> among the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical per|&s;ons governing in the <HI>Englih</HI> Church, is, Fir&s;t the King of <HI>England,</HI> who is as the Lawyers &s;ay, <HI>Per&s;onae &s;acra &amp; mixta cum &s;acerdote.</HI> The King is the &s;upreme Bi|&s;hop of <HI>England</HI>: and at his <HI>Coronation,</HI> by a &s;olemn Con&s;ecration, and Unction he becomes a Spiritual Per&s;on, Sacred and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, for, as he hath put upon him <HI>Corona Regni,</HI> as an Embleme of his King-&s;hip, and power in Temporals; &s;o hath he <HI>Stola Sacerdotis,</HI> commonly cal|led <HI>Ve&s;tis Dalmatica,</HI> as a <HI>Levitical Ephod,</HI> to &s;ignify his Prie&s;thood and power in Spi|rituals.

<P>Next to the King in the Church Govern|ment are the Bi&s;hops, whereof two are called <HI>Primats, Metropolitans</HI> or Arch|bi&s;hops, that is chief Bi&s;hops, the one

<P>Under the&s;e two Archbi&s;hops are 26 Bi&s;hopricks, whereof 22 are reckoned in the Province of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and four in the Province of <HI>York.</HI> So that there are be&s;ides the two Archbi&s;hops twenty four Bi&s;hops, all which have the Title of Lords by rea&s;on of their <HI>Baronies</HI> annext to their Bi&s;hopricks, and have precedence of all other <HI>Barons</HI> both in Parliament, and other A&s;&s;emblies: among&s;t the&s;e pre|cedes always the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> who by antient right is accounted <HI>Dean</HI> of the <HI>Epi&s;copal Colledg</HI> of that Province, and by vertue thereof is to &s;ignify the Plea&s;ure of his Metropolitan to all the Bi&s;hops of the Province, to execute his <HI>Mandates,</HI> to di&s;per&s;e his <HI>Mi&s;&s;ives</HI> on all emergency of affaires to precide in Convocations or Pro|vincial <HI>Synods</HI> during the nece&s;&s;ary ab|&s;ence of the <HI>Metropolitan.</HI> Next to <HI>Lon|don</HI> in Parliament, precedes <HI>Durham,</HI> and then <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI>: all the re&s;t of the Bi|&s;hops take place according to the Seniority of their Con&s;ecrations.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20">The Function of an <HI>Engli&s;h Bi&s;hop</HI> con|&s;i&s;ts in what he may act, either by his <HI>Epi&s;|copal Order,</HI> or by his <HI>Epi&s;copal Juri&s;dic|tion.</HI></P>
<P>By his <HI>Epi&s;copal Order</HI> he may ordain <HI>Deacons</HI> and <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> he may Dedicate Churches and burying places, may ad|mini&s;ter the Rite and Ceremony of Con|firmation, without whom none of the&s;e things may be done.</P>
<P>The <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> of a Bi&s;hop is either <HI>Ordinary</HI> or <HI>Delegated</HI>; the <HI>Ordinary,</HI> is what by the Law of the Land belongs to each Bi&s;hop, in his own Dioce&s;s; the <HI>De|legated,</HI> is what the King is plea&s;ed to confer upon him, not as a Bi&s;hop, but as he is a Subject, and a con&s;iderable Mem|ber of the Kingdom: For all Clergymen are in <HI>England</HI> (as antiently among Gods own People the <HI>Jews,</HI> and among&s;t the <HI>Primitive</HI> Chri&s;tians, &s;o &s;oon as they were under Chri&s;tian Emperors) judged fit to en|joy divers temporal honours and employ|ments: as,</P>

<PB N="18" REF="21">
have been protected from the oppre&s;&s;ion of their cau&s;ele&s;s enemies, but many dif|ferences have been compo&s;ed without any Law-&s;ute, in a more Chri&s;tian and le&s;s ex|pen&s;ive way.</P>
<P>Secondly to be of His Maje&s;ties Privy Council, where frequently Ca&s;es of Con|&s;cience may ari&s;e, relating to State mat|ters, that will admit neither of delay nor publication, and therefore after the pattern of that excellent Chri&s;tian Emperor <HI>Con|&s;tantine</HI> the Great; our good Kings both before and &s;ince the Reformation have al|ways admitted &s;ome &s;piritual per&s;ons to their Council Tables and Clo&s;et-debates.</P>
<P>Thirdly, to be employed in publick Treaties and Negotiations of Peace, and this both the Ancient and Modern practice will ju&s;tify, that none hath been more frequently and &s;uccesfully u&s;ed in &s;uch Me&s;&s;ages, then the Amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Fourthly, to enjoy &s;ome of the great Offices of the Crown, as to be <HI>Lord Chan|cellor, Lord Trea&s;urer,</HI> &amp;c. And it hath been ob&s;erved that in the late Kings Raign, when the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI> was <HI>Lord Trea|&s;urer,</HI> that Office was executed with as much diligence, faithfulne&s;s, dexterity, and content to the Subject, as well as to the King, as ever it had been by any of his late lay-Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>

him by the Law of the Land, for the bet|ter execution of that <HI>Jurisdiction.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> it &s;elf is e&s;tabli&s;hed partly by Statute Law, as to Licence Phy|&s;itians, Surgeons and School-Ma&s;ters to unite and con&s;olidiate &s;mall Pari&s;hes, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Civil Magi&s;trates in the execution of &s;ome Statutes concerning Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, to compel the payment of Tenths and Sub&s;idies due from the Clergy to the King.</P>
<P>Partly by Common Law, as upon the Kings Writ, to certify the Judges touch|ing legitimate and illegetimate Births and Marriages, to require upon the Kings Writ, the burning of an ob&s;tinate Here|tick, al&s;o to require the Kings Writ for impri&s;oning the Body of one that ob&s;tinate|ly &s;tands excommunicated 40 dayes.</P>
<P>And partly by Common and Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Law together, as to cau&s;e Wills of the Decea&s;ed to be proved, to grant Admini|&s;tration of Goods of &s;uch as dye inte&s;tate, to give order for the gathering and pre&s;er|ving of peri&s;hable Goods, where none is willing to admini&s;ter, to cau&s;e Account to be given of Admini&s;trations, to collate Benefices, to grant In&s;titutions to Bene|fices upon the Pre&s;entations of other Pa|trons, to command Induction to be gi|ven, to order the collecting and pre&s;erving of the Profits of vacant Benefices for the u&s;e of the Succe&s;&s;ors, to defend the Fran|chi&s;es and Liberties of the Church, to vi&s;it their particular Dioce&s;&s;es once in three

<P>Now, for the better executing of this <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> the Law of <HI>England</HI> hath furni&s;hed the Bi&s;hops with a power of <HI>Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures,</HI> whereof &s;ome may be inflicted both upon Lay-men and
<PB N="21" REF="22">
Church-men, as Su&s;pen&s;ion from entring into the Church, or el&s;e from receiving the Sacrament, or greater Excommunica|tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Others may be inflicted only upon <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Per&s;ons, as Seque&s;tra|tion of their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Profits, Su&s;|pen&s;ion, &s;ometimes <HI>ab Officio,</HI> &s;ometimes <HI>&agrave; Beneficio, Deprivation</HI> and <HI>Depo&s;ition,</HI> which is &s;ometimes verbal, by &s;entence pronounced again&s;t them; and &s;ometimes real by Degradation. Here note that of all the&s;e Cen&s;ures, Excommunication is never inflicted but only for Contumacy, as when a per&s;on being duly &s;ummoned will not appear, or appearing, will not obey the Orders of the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The &s;olemn manner of making a Bi&s;hop in <HI>England</HI> is as followeth,</P>
<P>When any Bi&s;hops See becomes vacant, the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> of that <HI>Cathedral</HI> gi|ving notice thereof to the King, who is Patron of all the Bi&s;hopricks in <HI>England</HI>; and humbly reque&s;ting that His Maje&s;ty will give leave for them to cho&s;e another; the King hereupon grants to the <HI>Dean,</HI> his <HI>Cong&egrave; d' E&s;lire,</HI> which in French (wherein it was antiently penned) &s;ignifies leave to elect, then the Dean &s;ummons a Chapter or a&s;&s;embly of the Prebendaries, who either elect, the per&s;on recommended by His Ma|je&s;ties Letters, or &s;hew cau&s;e to the con|trary. Next the Election is certified to the party Elected, who doth mode&s;tly refu&s;e it the fir&s;t and &s;econd time, and if he refu&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="23">
it a third time, then that being certifyed to His Maje&s;ty, another is recommended; when the Election is accepted by the party, it is certifyed to the King and the Archbi|&s;hop of that Province, whereupon the King gives his Royal A&s;&s;ent under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI>; which is exhibited to the Archbi&s;hop of the Province, with com|mand to confirm and con&s;ecrate him, here|to the Archbi&s;hop &s;ub&s;cribes <HI>Fiat Confirma|tio,</HI> and gives Commi&s;&s;ion under his Ar|chiepi&s;copal Seal to his Vicar-General, to perform all the Acts required for per|fecting his Confirmation.</P>
<P>The Vicar-General then in the name of the Archbi&s;hop &s;ends forth a Citation, &s;ummoning all Oppo&s;ers of the &s;aid Electi|on or Per&s;on Elected, to appear at a cer|tain time and place e&s;pecially a&s;&s;igned to make their objections. This is done by an Officer of the Arches u&s;ually at <HI>Bow Church</HI> in <HI>Cheap&s;id London</HI> by Proclamation three times, and then affixing the &s;aid Ci|tation on the Church door for all people to read, the &s;aid Officer returns an Authen|tick Certificate thereof to the Archbi&s;hop and Vicar-General. At the day and place a&s;&s;igned for the appearance of the Oppo|&s;ers the Vicar General &s;its, then the Proc|tor for the &s;aid Dean and Chapter, exhi|bits the Royal a&s;&s;ent and the Commi&s;&s;ion of the Archbi&s;hop; which read and accept|ed by the Vicar-General, the Proctor ex|hibits the Proxy from the Dean and Chap|ter, and then pre&s;ents the Elected Bi&s;hop,

Next the Proctor giving a &s;ummary Petiti|on, wherein is deduced the whole Proce&s;s of Election and Con&s;ent, de&s;ires a time to be a&s;&s;igned to prove it, which the Vi|car-General admits and decrees: After which the Proctor exhibits the Royal A&s;|&s;ent, with the Elected Bi&s;hops A&s;&s;ent, and the Certificate to the Archbi&s;hop, and de|&s;ires a term pre&s;ently to be a&s;&s;igned to hear final &s;entence, which the Vicar-General decrees. Then the Proctor de&s;ires that all Oppo&s;ers &s;hould be again called, which being thrice publickly done, and none ap|pearing, nor oppo&s;ing, they are pronoun|ced contumacious, and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, by a Schedule read and &s;ub&s;cribed by the &s;aid Vicar-General.

<P>Next the Judge of the Arches reads and &s;ub&s;cribes the Sentence, after which u&s;u|ally there is an entertainment made for the Officers and others there pre&s;ent, which being once done at the Sign of the Nags Head in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> near the &s;aid <HI>Bow Church,</HI> gave occa&s;ion to our adver&s;aries of the Romi&s;h Church, to affirm that Fa|ble,

<P>When a Bi&s;hop is Elected, and the Electi|on confirmed, he may give In&s;titution, and do his ordinary Jurisdiction, and may &s;it in Parliament as a Lord thereof, accor|ding to <HI>Sir Ed. Coke</HI> 4. <HI>In&s;titut p.</HI> 47.</P>
<P>After the Confirmation, then according to the Kings Mandate is the &s;olemn Con|&s;ecration of the Elected Bi&s;hop, which is done by the Archbi&s;hop with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two: other Bi&s;hops in manner follow|ing.</P>
<P>Upon &s;ome Sunday or Holy-day after Morning Service, the Archbi&s;hop begin|neth the Communion Service, after a cer|tain Prayer appointed for this occa&s;ion, one of the Bi&s;hops there pre&s;ent readeth the Epi&s;tle, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. another readeth the Go&s;pel, <HI>John</HI> 21. then after the Nicene Creed and &s;ome Sermon, the Elected Bi|&s;hop ve&s;ted with his Rochet or Linnen Gar|ment, is by two Bi&s;hops pre&s;ented to the Archbi&s;hop, or &s;ome other Bi&s;hop commi&s;|&s;ioned by him, &s;itting in his Chair, who demands the Kings Mandate for the Con|&s;ecration, and cau&s;es it to be read; then the Elect Bi&s;hop takes the Oath of Supre|macy and of Canonical Obedience to the Archbi&s;hop; and after divers prayers and &s;everal Interrogatories put to the Bi|&s;hop, and his An&s;wers, the re&s;t of the Epi&s;copal Habit is put upon him, and af|ter more prayers the Elect Bi&s;hop kneeleth down, and the Archbi&s;hop and Bi&s;hops

there pre&s;ent lay their hands on his head, and by a certain pious grave form of words, they con&s;ecrate him. Afterward the Arch|bi&s;hop doth deliver to the Bi&s;hop Elect a Bible with an other &s;et form of words, and &s;o all proceed to the Communion Ser|vice, and having received the Sacrament, and the Ble&s;&s;ing, they retire from Church to dinner, which is at the charge of the Bi&s;hop Elect, and is u&s;ually very &s;plendid and magnificent, the greate&s;t the Nobi|lity, Clergy, Judges, Privy-Coun&s;ellors, &amp;c. honouring it with their pre&s;ence, the expence hereof with Fees of Con&s;ecration commonly amounting to Six or Seven hundred pounds.</P>
<P>This form and manner of con&s;ecrating Bi&s;hops is accordingly to the rule laid down in the Fourth Council of <HI>Carthage,</HI> about the year 470, generally received in all the Provinces of the We&s;tern Church.</P>
<P>Note that by our Order of Con&s;ecra|ting Bi&s;hops, it is evident that Bi&s;hops are lookt upon as a di&s;tinct Order of them|&s;elves, and not only as a different de|gree from the re&s;t of the Presbyters, as &s;ome would have it.</P>
<P>Next goes forth a Mandate from the Archbi&s;hop to the Archdeacon of his Pro|vince, to in&s;tal the Bi&s;hop Elected, con|firmed and con&s;ecrated.</P>
<P>Then the &s;aid Bi&s;hop is introduced into the Kings pre&s;ence, to do his Homage for his Temporalties or Barony, by kneeling down and putting his hands between the

hands of the King &s;itting in a Chair of State, and by taking of a &s;olemn Oath to be true and faithful to His Maje&s;ty, and that he holds his Temporalties of him.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the new Bi&s;hop compounds for the fir&s;t Fruits of his Bi&s;hoprick, that is, agrees for his fir&s;t years profits to be paid to the King, within two years or more if the King plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lation of a Bi&s;hop from one Bi&s;hoprick to another differs onely in this, from the manner of making a Bi&s;hop, that there is no Con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ation.</P>
<P>The Tran&s;lation of a Bi&s;hop to be Arch|bi&s;hop differs only in the Commi&s;&s;ion which is directed by His Maje&s;ty to four or more Bi&s;hops to confirm him. Note that the difference between an Archbi&s;hop and a Bi&s;hop, is that the Archbi&s;hop with other Bi&s;hops doth con&s;ecrate a Bi&s;hop, as a Bi|&s;hop with other Prie&s;ts doth ordain a Prie&s;t: The Archbi&s;hop vi&s;its the whole Province, the Bi&s;hop only his Dioce&s;s; The Arch|bi&s;hop can convocate a Provincial Synod, the Bi&s;hop only a Dioce&s;an Synod; The Archbi&s;hop is Ordinary to; and hath Ca|nonical Authority over all the Bi&s;hops of his Province, as the Bi&s;hop hath over all the Prie&s;ts of his Dioce&s;s.</P>

Upon the Kings Writ of <HI>Cong&egrave; d' E&s;lire</HI> (as before mentioned) the Dean and Prebendaries are to elect the Bi&s;hop of that Dioce&s;s. Cathedral and Colle|giate Churches are as it were Seminaries or Seed-plots, whereout from time to time may be cho&s;en fit per&s;ons to govern the Church, for having left the Country, and living herein a Society together, they learn experience, they read men, they by little and little put off the familiarity of the inferiour Countrey Clergy, and thereby render them&s;elves the more fit to be &s;et over them in Government. The Dean and Prebendaries, during their required re&s;i|dence in their Cathedral or Collegiate Churches are to keep Ho&s;pitallity, upon all Fe&s;tivals to read Divinity in their turns,
<PB N="28" REF="26">
which is now turned to Sermons, or &s;et &s;peeches in the Pulpit; at due time to ad|mini&s;ter the Lords Supper; to frequent the Publick Divine Service, to in&s;truct the Country Clergy, and direct them how and what to preach, whereby they may be&s;t profit their Auditors: In a word, as they excel others in dignity, and are therefore &s;tiled Prelats, &s;o by their more eminent piety and charity, they are to be exam|ples and paterns to the inferiour Clergy.</P>
<P>In every Cathedral or Bi&s;hops See there is a Dean and divers Prebendaries or Ca|nons, who&s;e number is uncertain.</P>
<P>Deans of the old Foundations, founded before the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Mona&s;teris, are brought to their Dignities much like Bi|&s;hops, the King fir&s;t &s;ending forth his <HI>Con|g&egrave; d' e&s;lire</HI> to the Chapter, they electing, and the King granting his Royal a&s;&s;ent; the Bi&s;hop confirms him, and gives his Mandate to in&s;tall him.</P>
<P>Deans of the new Foundations (upon &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Abbyes or Prinries tran&s;|formed by <HI>Henry</HI> 8. in to Dean and Chapter) are by a &s;horter cour&s;e in&s;talled by virtue of the Kings Letters Patents, without either Election or Confirmation.</P>
<P>Among the Canons or Prebendaries in the old Foundations, &s;ome are <HI>Canonici actu,</HI> having <HI>Prebendam &s;edile in Choro &amp; jus &s;uffragii in Capitulo</HI>; others are <HI>Ca|nonici in herbis</HI> (as they are called) having right to the next Prebend that &s;hall become void and having already a Stall in the

<P>A Prebend is properly the portion which every Prebendary of a Cathedral or Col|legiate Church receiveth in the right of his place for his maintenance <HI>qua&s;i pars vel portio prebenda.</HI></P>
<P>Next in the Government of the Engli&s;h Church may be reckoned Archdeacons, whereof there are 60 in all <HI>England</HI>; Their Office is to vi&s;it two years in three, and to enquire of Reparations and Moveables belonging to Churches, to reform abu&s;es, in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, and to bring the more weighty affairs before the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;hop of the Dioce&s;s; and therefore he is called <HI>Alter Epi&s;copi Oculus</HI> (the other being the Dean, as is mentioned in the fir&s;t part of the <HI>Pre|&s;ent State</HI>) Moreover the Office of an Archdeacon is upon the Bi&s;hops Mandate to induct Clerks into their Benefices, and thereby to give them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the Profits beloging thereto.</P>
<P>Many Archdeacons have by Pre&s;cripti|on, their Courts and Officials as Bi&s;hops have, whereof more hereafter.</P>
<P>After Archdeacons are the <HI>Archipresby|teri</HI> or Rural Deans, &s;o called perhaps at fir&s;t for his over&s;ight of &s;ome Ten Pari&s;h Prie&s;ts; their Office is now upon orders to convocate the Clergy, to &s;ignifie to them &s;ometimes by Letters the Bi&s;hops plea&s;ure, and to give induction for the Archdeacon living afar off.</P>
<P>Next are to be con&s;idered the Prie&s;ts of every particular Pari&s;h, who are common|ly

called the Rectors, unle&s;s the predial Tythes are impropriated, and then they are &s;tiled Vicars, <HI>qua&s;i vice fungentes Rectorum.</HI> Their Office is to take care of all their Pari&s;hioners Souls, and like good Shepherds, to handle every particular Sheep apart; to Catechi&s;e the ignorant, reduce the &s;traying, confirm the wavering, convince the ob&s;tinate, reprehend the wick|ed, confute Schi&s;maticks, reconcile diffe|rences among&s;t Neighbours, to exerci&s;e the power of binding and loo&s;ing of &s;ouls as occa&s;ion &s;hall offer, to read duly Di|vine Service, to Admini&s;ter the holy Sa|craments, to vi&s;it the Sick, to Marry, to Bury, to render publick thanks after Child|bearing, to keep a Regi&s;ter of all Marria|ges, Chri&s;tnings and Burials that &s;hall happen within the Pari&s;h, to read the Di|vine Sermons or Homilies appointed by Authority (and if the Bi&s;hop think fit) to read or &s;peak by heart their own concep|tions in the Pulpit.</P>
<P>La&s;tly Deacons, who&s;e Office is to take care of the Poor, Bapti&s;e, Read in the Church, a&s;&s;i&s;t the Prie&s;t at the Lords Sup|per by giving the Cup only.</P>
<P>After this brief account of Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal per&s;ons, &s;omewhat may here not un|fitly be added touching tho&s;e per&s;ons who though not in holy Orders, yet have a peculiar Relation to the Church, and are <HI>qua&s;i &s;emi Eccle&s;ia&s;tici,</HI> as fir&s;t Patrons of Churches, who by fir&s;t building of Church|es, or fir&s;t endowing them with Lands, have

obtained for them and their Heirs a right of Advow&s;on or Patronage, who&s;e office and duty is to pre&s;ent a fit Clerk (when the Church is void) to the Bi&s;hop to be by him Canonically in&s;tituted, and to protect the &s;aid Church as far as he can from all wrong, and in ca&s;e his Clerk prove unfit for the place, to give notice thereof to the Bi|&s;hop.</P>
<P>Next are the <HI>Oeconomi vel Eccle&s;iae Guardiani,</HI> the Church wardens, who&s;e Office is to &s;ee that the Church be in good repair, fitly adorned, and nothing want|ing for Divine Service, Sacrament, and Sermons; that the Church yard be &s;uffi|ciently mounded or inclo&s;ed, that there be an exact Terrier of the Glebe Lands, and if any thing belonging to the Church be de|tained, to &s;ue for the &s;ame; to ob&s;erve that all Pari&s;honers come duly to Divine Service, to require the penalty for ab&s;ence, to enquire after, to admoni&s;h and to pre|&s;ent to the Bi&s;hop &s;candalous livers, to col|lect the Charity of the Pari&s;honers for poor Strangers, to declare and to execute the orders of the Bi&s;hop, to &s;ee that none pre|&s;ume to vent his own conceptions in the Pulpit, unle&s;s he hath a &s;pecial licence &s;o to do. The Churchwardens are elected every Ea&s;ter Week, u&s;ually by the Par&s;on and Pari&s;honers if they &s;o agree; if not, then one by the Par&s;on, and the other by the Pari&s;hioners.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o in greater Pari&s;hes joyned with the Church wardens <HI>Te&s;tes Synodales,</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="28">
anciently called Synods-men, now cor|ruptly called Sides-men, who are to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Church-wardens, in enquiries into the lives of inordinate livers, and in pre&s;enting men at Vi&s;itations.</P>
<P>La&s;tly the Sacri&s;tan, corruptly the Sex|ton or Clark, who is ordinarily to be cho|&s;en by the Par&s;on only: he ought to be twenty years old or above, of good life, that can read, write, and &s;ing: his office is to &s;erve at Church the Prie&s;t and Church|wardens.</P>
<P>In the Church of <HI>England</HI> there are, as in the antient primitive times, three Or|ders, Bi&s;hops, Prie&s;ts, and Deacons. None may be admitted Deacon before the age of 23 years, unle&s;s he hath a Di&s;pen&s;ation to be admitted younger: None may be made a Prie&s;t till he be completely 24 years old. None may be admitted Bi&s;hop till full 30 years old.</P>
<P>The Ordination of Prie&s;ts and Deacons is four times the year, upon four &s;everal Sundayes in the Ember or Failing Weeks, that &s;o all the Nation may at once in their joynt Prayers to God, recommend them that are to receive Ordination, which is performed by a Bi&s;hop, in a &s;olemn grave devout manner thus for Deacons. After Morning Prayer there is a Sermon, de|claring the Duty and Office of Deacons and Prie&s;ts; then they being decently ha|bited, are pre&s;ented to the Bi&s;hop by the Archdeacon or his Deputy, whom the Bi|&s;hop askes if he hath, made due inquiry
<PB N="33" REF="28">
of them, and then askes the people if they know any notable impediment or crime in any one of them; after follow certain godly Prayers, then a Collect, Epi&s;tle and Go&s;|pel: but before the Go&s;pel the Oath of Su|premacy is admini&s;tred to every one of them, and the Bi&s;hop putteth divers god|ly que&s;tions to them, which being an&s;we|red they all kneel and he laying his hands upon them &s;everally doth ordain them Dea|cons; then delivers to every one of them the New Te&s;tament, and gives them au|thority to read the &s;ame in the Church; then one of them appointed by the Bi&s;hop reads the Go&s;pel, and then all with the Bi&s;hop proceed to the Communion, and &s;o are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with the Ble&s;&s;ing pronounced by the Bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The Ordination of Prie&s;ts is partly in the &s;ame manner, only the Epi&s;tle and Go&s;|pel are different; and after the que&s;tions and an&s;wers made, the Bi&s;hop puts up a particular prayer for them, and that ended, he de&s;ires the Congregation to recommend them to God &s;ecretly in their prayers for doing of which there is a competent time of general &s;ilence, then follows <HI>Vent Cre|ator Spiritus</HI> in Meter to be &s;ung, then af|ter another prayer, they all kneeling, the Bi&s;hop, with the Prie&s;ts pre&s;ent, layeth his hands upon the head of every one &s;everally, and gives them Ordination in a grave &s;et form of words, different both from that of Bi&s;hops and that of Deacons, the re&s;t as in the ordaining of Deacons,</P>

<P>In Convocation are debated only matters concerning Religion and the Church, and &s;ometime of giving His Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;i&s;tance in Money; for as the Laity cannot be tax|ed without their own con&s;ent, &s;ignified by their Repre&s;entative in Parliament, &s;o the Clergy cannot be taxed without their con|&s;ent, &s;ignified by their Repre&s;entative in Convocation.</P>

<P>For civil affairs that concern the Church, the highe&s;t Court is the Court of Dele|gates for the juri&s;diction whereof it was provided 25 <HI>H.</HI> 8. that it &s;hall be lawful for any &s;ubject of <HI>England,</HI> in ca&s;e of de|fect of ju&s;tice in the Courts of the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to appeal to the Kings Maje&s;ty in his Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> and that upon &s;uch appeal, a Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal &s;hall be directed to certain per&s;ons particularly de&s;igned for that bu&s;i|ne&s;s; &s;o that from the highe&s;t Court of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> there lies an Appeal to this Court of Delegates, and be|yond this to none other.</P>
<P>Next to the Court of Delegates are the Courts of the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> where any Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Sutes between any per&s;ons may (waving all inferior Courts) be decided; among&s;t them the highe&s;t Court is the Court of Arches, &s;o called from the Arched Church and Tower of <HI>S.

<P>In the next place the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> hath his Court of Audience kept within the Archbi&s;hops Palace, and medleth not with any difference between parties, but concerning Elections and con|&s;ecration of Bi&s;hops, Admi&s;&s;ion and In&s;ti|tution to Benefices, dipen&s;ing with Banes of Matrimony, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Moreover, every Archdeacon hath his Court and Juri&s;diction, where &s;maller differences ari&s;ing within his limits are pleaded. Al&s;o the Dean and Chapter hath a Court, and take cognizance of Cau&s;es happening in places belonging to the Ca|thedral.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there are certain peculiar Juri&s;|dictions belonging to &s;ome certain Pari&s;h|es, the Inhabitants whereof are exempt &s;ometimes from the Archdeacons Juri&s;dicti|on, and &s;ometimes from the Bi&s;hops Juri&s;|diction.</P>

<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the cognizance whereof belongs not to the Common Law of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Laws and Con&s;titutions whereby the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government doth &s;tand, and the Church of <HI>England</HI> is governed, are fir&s;t general Canons made by general Councels; al&s;o the <HI>Arbitria &s;anctorum Pa|trum,</HI> the opinion of Fathers, the grave Decrees of &s;everal Holy Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome,</HI> which the Kings of <HI>England</HI> from time to time have admitted.</P>
<P>Next our own Con&s;titutions made anti|ently in &s;everal Provincial Synods, either by the Legats <HI>Otho</HI> and <HI>Othobon,</HI> &s;ent from <HI>Rome</HI>; or by &s;everal Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Can|terbury</HI>; all which are by 25 <HI>H.</HI> 8. of force in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o far as they are not repug|nant to the Laws and Cu&s;toms of <HI>England,</HI> or the Kings Prerogative. Then the Ca|nons made in Convocations of later times, as <HI>primo Jacobi,</HI> and confirmed by his Roy|al Authority. Al&s;o &s;ome Statutes enacted by Parliament touching Eccle&s;ia&s;tical af|fairs: And la&s;tly, divers Cu&s;toms not writ|ten, but yet in u&s;e beyond the memory of man: and where the&s;e fail, the Civil Law takes place.</P>
<P>The manner of Tryals by the&s;e Laws and Cu&s;toms are different from the Tryals at Common Law, and are briefly thus. Fir&s;t goes forth a Citation, then Bill and An|&s;wer, then by Proofs, Witne&s;&s;es, and Pre|&s;umptions the matter is argued <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>con,</HI> and the Canon and Civil Laws quo|ted, then without any Jury, the definitive
<PB N="43" REF="33">
&s;entence of the Judge pa&s;&s;&s;eth, and upon that Execution. And this is the manner of try|ing Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Civil Cau&s;es; but Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical criminal Cau&s;es are tryed by way of Accu&s;ation, Denunciation, or Inqui&s;i|tion. The fir&s;t, when &s;ome one takes upon him to prove the crime: the &s;econd, when the Churchwardens pre&s;ent and are nor bound to prove, becau&s;e it is pre&s;umed they do it without any malice, and that the crime is notorious. La&s;tly, by Inqui&s;ition, when by rea&s;on of common fame, inquiry is made by the Bi&s;hop, <HI>ex officio &s;uo,</HI> by calling &s;ome of the neighborhood to their Oaths, or the party accu&s;ed to his Oath <HI>ex officio,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e the Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical Judge doth it <HI>ex officio &s;uo,</HI> which is very antient, and was u&s;ual among the Jews; &s;o <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to <HI>Acan, Fili mi tribue gloriam, &amp;c.</HI> So God him&s;elf to <HI>Adam</HI> up|on his fir&s;t tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and likewi&s;e after|ward to <HI>Sodom</HI>; but by the prevailing faction in the long Parliament, this power was extorted from the Church, the want whereof is one main cau&s;e of the great libertini&s;me and debauchery of the Na|tion.</P>
<P>Now the puni&s;hments inflicted by the&s;e Spiritual or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Courts, accord|ing to the&s;e Spiritual or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Laws, proceed in this manner. Fir&s;t the party delinquent is admoni&s;h'd; next goes forth <HI>minor Excommunicatio,</HI> whereby he is excommunicated or excluded from the Church; or if not from the Church, yet
<PB N="44" REF="34">
from the Communion of the Lords Supper, is di&s;enabled to be Plaintiff in a Law Sute, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this commonly for &s;tubborne&s;s &s;hewed by not appearing in the Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Court upon &s;ummons, or not obeying the Orders of the Court which though in &s;malle&s;t matters, yet may be a very great crime; for <HI>Res praecepta quo facilior e&s;t ob|&s;ervatu eo praecepti violatio e&s;t gravior cum fit magis &s;pontanea,</HI> as <HI>S.

And here|in the Church of <HI>England</HI> proceedeth no otherwi&s;e than the State of <HI>England</HI>; for &s;o odious in the eye of the common Law of <HI>Enland,</HI> is the contempt thereof, that not on|ly for Felonies, but even in an Action of the ca&s;e, in an Action of a &s;mall Debt, Account or Detinue, if a man will not appear and &s;ubmit him&s;elf to a Tryal at Law, a Pro|ce&s;s of Outlawry is grounded again&s;t him, and he being once Outlawed, he is out of the protection of the Law. <HI>Caput gerit lupinum,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Bracton,</HI> an Outlaw'd was antiently lookt upon as a Wolf, lawfully to be killed by any man that &s;hould meet him, as mo&s;t ju&s;t, that he who contemned the Law, and therein the King, &s;hould not have benefit by the Law, nor protecti|on from the King, and at this day he is to

<P>This power of le&s;&s;er Excommunication the Bi&s;hop may delegate to any grave Prie&s;t with the Chancellour.</P>
<P><HI>Excommunicato major</HI> is not only an exclu&s;ion from the company of Chri&s;tians in Spiritual Duties, but al&s;o in Temporal affairs, and this commonly for Here&s;ie, Schi&s;m, Perjury, Ince&s;t, and &s;uch grievous crimes; and that it may be done with the more &s;olemnity and terror, it is to be pro|nounced by the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf in his proper per&s;on; and being &s;o Excommunicated, a man cannot in any Civil or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court, be Plaintiff or Witne&s;s. And in ca&s;e any man be &s;o &s;tubborn as to continue 40 days excommunicated, the Kings Writ <HI>de excommunicato capiendo</HI> is granted forth of the Chancery again&s;t him; where|upon he is ca&s;t into pri&s;on without Bail, there to lie till he hath &s;atisfied for his of|fence.</P>
<P>Next there is <HI>Anathemati&s;mus</HI> to be inflict|ed only upon an ob&s;tinate Heretick, where|by he is declared a publick Enemy of God, and rejected, and cur&s;ed, and delivered o|ver to eternal damnation: and this to be done by the Bi&s;hop, al&s;o in his own per|&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Dean and Chapter, or twelve other grave Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, there is <HI>Interdictum,</HI> whereby is prohibited all Divine Offices, as Chri&s;ti|an

an Burial, Admini&s;tration of Sacraments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in &s;uch a Place, or to &s;uch a People, and if this be again&s;t a People; it follows them where&s;oever they go; but if again&s;t a Place only, then the People of that Place may go to Divine Offices el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e general cen&s;ures of the Church, which re&s;pect Church Communi|on, there is another which toucheth the body of the Delinquent, called Publick Penance, when any one is compelled to confe&s;s in publick his fault, and to bewail it before the whole Congregation in the Church; which is done in this manner: the Delinquent is to &s;tand in the Church Porch upon &s;ome Sunday bare, head and feet, in a white Sheet, and a white Rod in his Hand, there bewailing him&s;elf, and beg|ing every one that pa&s;&s;es by to pray for him; then to enter the Church, falling down and ki&s;&s;ing the ground; then in the middle of the Church, placed in a higher place in the &s;ight of all the People, and over again&s;t the Mini&s;ter, who declares the foulne&s;s of his crime odious to God, and &s;candalous, to the Congregation, that God can no way be &s;atisfied but by applying Chri&s;ts &s;ufferings, nor the Congregation, but by an humble acknowledging of his &s;in, and te&s;tifying his &s;incere repentance and &s;orrow, not in words only, but with tears, and promi&s;ing there in the &s;ight of God and his Holy Angels, that by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and by Prayer, Meditation, and dai|ly works of Piety, he will endeavor hereaf|ter
<PB N="47" REF="35">
more carefully to watch again&s;t the temptations of the world, the allurements of the fle&s;h, and the &s;nares of the Devil: which being done, and the Prie&s;t in Chri&s;ts name pronouncing the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, the penitent humbly be&s;eeches the Congre|gation to pardon him that great &s;candal again&s;t them, and receive him into their holy Communion, and to account him again a Member of their Church and in te&s;timony hereof, out of their Chri&s;tian Charity, to vouch&s;afe to &s;ay with him aloud, the Lords Prayer. And this way of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> appears by divers Writers, to be the antient way u&s;ed by the Primitive Churches:</P>
<P>Note that it is ordained by the Canons of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that in ca&s;e the crime be not notorious and publick, the forenamed penance may at the parties re|que&s;t be commuted into a pecuniary Mulct for the poor of the Pari&s;h, or &s;ome Pious u&s;es, provided that for the Reformation of the Delinquent that way appear to be the more probable way; for &s;ome men will be thereby reclaimed, who by publication of their offence would become more impudent, and hardned, when they perceive their re|putation to be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>There remains one more puni&s;hment or Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cen&s;ure which toucheth the body, and that is denyal of Chri&s;tian bu|rial, which is inflicted not in <HI>poenam mor|tuorum,</HI> but in <HI>terrorem viventium,</HI> who naturally de&s;ire that after their death their
<PB N="48" REF="36">
bodies may be decently interred. And Chri|&s;tian burial is wont to be denyed by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> to per&s;ons dying ex|communicate, to perjured per&s;ons, to &s;uch as are hanged for Felony, or that wilfully kill them&s;elves, and to Apo&s;tates, Here|ticks, and Extortioners.</P>
<P>To the&s;e forenamed Cen&s;ures and Pu|ni&s;hments, both Laity and Clergy are &s;ub|ject; but be&s;ides the&s;e, there are puni&s;h|ments whereunto the Clergy only are lya|ble&punc; as fir&s;t, <HI>Su&s;pen&s;io ab Officio,</HI> when a Mini&s;ter for a time is declared unfit to ex|ecute the Office of a Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Then <HI>Su&s;pen&s;io a Beneficio,</HI> when a Mini|&s;ter for a time is deprived of the profits of his Benefice; and the&s;e two Cen&s;ures are wont to be for &s;maller crimes.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Deprivatio a Beneficio,</HI> when for a greater crime, a Mini&s;ter is wholly and for ever deprived of his Living.</P>
<P>And fourthly, <HI>Deprivatio ab Officio,</HI> when a Mini&s;ter is wholly and for ever deprived of his Orders, and this is called <HI>Depo&s;itio,</HI> or <HI>Degradatio,</HI> and is common|ly for &s;ome heynous crime, meriting death, and is performed by the Bi&s;hop in a &s;o|lemn manner, pulling off from the Crimi|nal his Ve&s;tments, and other En&s;ignes of his Order; and this in the pre&s;ence of the Civil Magi&s;trate, to whom he is then de|livered to be puni&s;hed as a Lay man for the like offence. And herein Bi&s;hops are to take &s;pecial care to behave them&s;elves <GAP DESC="foreign">, not
<PB N="49" REF="36">
as lording over Gods Heritage, not as ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters over Servants, to gain by their puni&s;hments, but as Fathers over Children, for their amendment, and as be|ing Mini&s;ters in Spiritual affairs, to u&s;e their power for the good of Chri&s;tians, and to conduct that power by moderation.</P>

<P>None but the King hath authority to &s;ummon a Parliament: In the Kings ab|&s;ence out of the Realm, the <HI>Cu&s;tos Regni</HI> in the Kings name doth &s;ummon a Par|liament, and during the Kings minority within the Realm, the <HI>Protector Regni</HI> doth the &s;ame.</P>

Clergy-men as well as Lay-men; there &s;ate the <HI>Procuratores Cleri,</HI> two for each Dio|ce&s;s, repre&s;enting all the Clergy-Com|mons of the Dioce&s;s, as the Knights of the Shire doth all the Lay-Commons of the Shire; for it was then judged expedient that every Freeman of <HI>England,</HI> as well Clergy as Laity, &s;hould in pa&s;&s;ing of all Laws touching propiety, whereunto they were to be &s;ubject, give their con&s;ent per|&s;onally or immediately by them&s;elves, or el&s;e by &s;ome that by their Election &s;hould mediately undertake for them, and the words of the Writ for &s;ummoning the <HI>Pro|curatores Cleri,</HI> as afore&s;aid, &s;eem to war|rant the &s;ame at this day.</P>
<P>The Power and Priviledges of both Hou&s;es of Parliament are divers and di|&s;tinct one from an other.</P>
<P>The Lords Hou&s;e hath a power not one|ly in making and repealing Laws, but al&s;o <HI>in tractando &amp; con&s;ilium impendendo,</HI> as the words of the Writ are, al&s;o in judging of Controver&s;ies, judging in the arraign|ment of any Peer of the Realm, putting men to their Oaths, e&s;pecially in mat|ters of importance, as the Corruption of Judges and Magi&s;trates, in Errours, Illegal proceedings in other Courts, in Appeals from Decrees in Chancery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords that in their Religion con|form not to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> may yet &s;it and have Suffrage in the Lords Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>All the Lords Spiritual and Temporal have this Priviledge, That if by rea&s;on of Sickne&s;s, or other bu&s;ine&s;s they cannot ap|pear,
<PB N="58" REF="41">
they may make Proxies to vote in their &s;tead, after Licence obtained by a Let|ter under the Kings Signet, to be excu&s;ed for their ab&s;ence: &s;o that in every Parlia|ment, every per&s;on in <HI>England,</HI> either by him&s;elf, Proxy, or Repre&s;entative is &s;aid to be there, and to have his Suffrage for making or repealing any Law.</P>
<P>The Commons have al&s;o a power in ma|king and repealing Laws, they al&s;o have their Negative Voyce, for Levying of any money upon the Subject, the Bill is to be|gin in the Commons Hou&s;e, becau&s;e from them doth ari&s;e the greater part of Mo|neys.</P>
<P>The Commons have the Priviledge to &s;upplicate and propo&s;e Laws, to impeach publick Delinquents, even the highe&s;t Lords of the Kingdom, both Spiritual and Temporal.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons is the Grand Inque&s;t of the Realm, &s;ummoned from all parts to pre&s;ent publick grievances, and Delinquents to the King and Lords to be redre&s;&s;ed and puni&s;hed by them; and to this purpo&s;e, the Lords &s;it in their Robes on the Bench covered, as Judges do in other Judicatories; they &s;wear and exa|mine Witne&s;&s;es, and at length pa&s;s &s;entence, whil&s;t the Members of the Commons Hou&s;e &s;tand bare at the Bar of the Lords Hou&s;e, produce Witne&s;&s;es, mannage evidence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Note that although every Member of the Commons Hou&s;e is cho&s;en to &s;erve for one particular County, City, or Burrough,
<PB N="60" REF="42">
yet he &s;erves for the whole Kingdom, and his voyce equal to any other, his power ab&s;olute to con&s;ent or di&s;&s;ent without ever acquainting tho&s;e that &s;ent him, or deman|ding their a&s;&s;ent, as the States General of the <HI>United Neatherlands</HI> are obliged to do in many Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>Yet are they to make that their &s;pecial care to promote the Good of that County, City or Borough for which they &s;erve.</P>
<P>Although the Lords of Parliament are to bear their own charges, becau&s;e they re|pre&s;ent there only them&s;elves; yet all the Commons, both Lay and Clergy, that is, the <HI>Procuratores Cleri,</HI> are to have <HI>ratio|nabiles Expen&s;as</HI> (as the words of the Writ are) that is, &s;uch allowance as the King con&s;idering the Prices of all things, &s;hall judge meet to impo&s;e upon the people to pay. In the 17 <HI>Edward</HI> 2. it was 10 <HI>groats</HI> for Knights, and 5 <HI>groats</HI> for Burge&s;&s;es, but not long after it was 4 <HI>s.</HI> a day for dub|bed Knights, and 2 <HI>s.</HI> for all others; which in tho&s;e days, as appears by the prices of all things, was a con&s;iderable &s;um, above 20 times more than it is now, for not one|ly their expences were con&s;idered, though that was great, by rea&s;on of the &s;uta|ble attendance that then every Parliament man had, but al&s;o their pains, their lo&s;s of time, and nece&s;&s;ary neglect of their own private affairs for the &s;ervice of their Country; and when the Countries, Ci|ties and Burroughs, paid &s;o dear for their expences, they were wont to take care
<PB N="61" REF="42">
to choo&s;e &s;uch men as were be&s;t able and mo&s;t diligent in the &s;peedy di&s;patch of af|faires, by which means with &s;ome other, more bu&s;ine&s;s in tho&s;e times was di&s;patch|ed in Parliament in a week, then is now perhaps in ten: &s;o that the Protections for Parliament men and their Servant from Arre&s;ts, were not then grievous, when &s;carce any Parliament or Se&s;&s;ion la&s;|ted &s;o long as one whole Term.</P>
<P>In the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> 3. the Parlia|ments &s;ometimes &s;ate but eight days, and &s;ometimes le&s;s, as may be &s;een in the Re|cords of the Tower, and yet tran&s;acted &s;everal and weighty affairs of the Nation, many things being prepared before hand, (as &s;ome think) by the King and his privy Council, as they are at pre&s;ent in <HI>Sweden,</HI> and that commonly they then debated one|ly upon &s;uch things, as the King did pro|po&s;e, which is now done by the Convo|cation of the Clergy of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The afore-mentioned expences being du|ly paid, did cau&s;e all the petty decayed Burroughs of <HI>England</HI> to become hum|ble Suitors to the King that they might not be obliged to &s;end Burge&s;&s;es to Parli|ment, whereby it comes to pa&s;s that divers were unburge&s;&s;ed, as it was in particular granted to <HI>Chipping,</HI> or <HI>Market Torriton</HI> up|on their petition, and then the number of the Commons hou&s;e being &s;carce half &s;o many as at pre&s;ent, their Debates and Bills were &s;ooner expedited, no faction among them, nor di&s;tinction of parties, but al|together
<PB N="62" REF="43">
by a ble&s;&s;ed unanimity among&s;t them&s;elves, and complyance with the Lords rarely denyed any thing to the King, and as rarely were denyed any thing by the King.</P>
<P>The manner of debates of pa&s;&s;ing of Bills and Acts, is thus.</P>
<P>It is the practi&s;e of each Hou&s;e to debate not onely of what the King hath propo&s;ed, but of any other matters, though heretofore that hath &s;ometimes been by their Sove|raign expre&s;&s;y forbidden.</P>
<P>It is free for any man of the Parliament, or not of the Parliament, to get a Bill drawn by &s;ome Lawyer, and give the &s;ame to the Speaker or Clerk of the Parliament to be pre&s;ented at a time convenient, and this Bill may be put fir&s;t either in the Lords Hou&s;e or the Commons Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Whatever is propo&s;ed for a Law, is fir&s;t put in Writing, and call'd a Bill, which, being read commonly after 9 of the clock in a full A&s;&s;embly, it is either unanimou&s;ly rejected at fir&s;t, or el&s;e allowed to be deba|ted, and then it is committed to a certain number of the Hou&s;e pre&s;ently nominated and called a Committee. After it hath been amended, and twice read two &s;eve|ral days in the Hou&s;e, then it is is engro&s;|&s;ed, that is, written fair in Parchment, and read the third time another day, and then, if it be in the Lords Hou&s;e, the Lord Keeper, in the Commons Hou&s;e, the Speak|er demandeth if they will have it put to the que&s;tion, whether a Law or no Law?
<PB N="63" REF="43">
if the major part be for it, there is writ|ten on the Bill by the Clerk, <HI>So it baill&egrave; aux Communes,</HI> or, <HI>So it baill&egrave; aux Seigneurs,</HI> retaining &s;till in this, and &s;ome other things about making Laws, the cu&s;tom of our Ance&s;tors, who were generally skilled in the French tongue.</P>
<P>Note that when the Speaker finds divers Bills prepared to be put to the que&s;tion, he gives notice the day before, that on the morrow he intends to put &s;uch Bills to the pa&s;&s;ing or third reading, and de&s;ires the &s;pecial attendance of all the Members.</P>
<P>Note al&s;o, that if a Bill be rejected, it cannot be any more propo&s;ed during that Se&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Bill &s;ent by the Commons up to the Lords is u&s;uall (to &s;hew their re&s;pect) at|tended with 30 or 40 of the Members of the Hou&s;e, as they come up to the Lords Bar, the Member that hath the Bill ma|king three profound reverences, deliver|eth it to the Lord Keeper, who for that pur|po&s;e comes down to the Barr.</P>
<P>A Bill &s;ent by the Lords to the Com|mons, is u&s;ually &s;ent by &s;ome of the Ma|&s;ters of the Chancery, or other per&s;on who&s;e place is on the Wool&s;acks (and by none of the Member, of that Hou&s;e) and they coming up to the Speaker, and bow|ing thrice, deliver to him the Bill, after one of them hath read the Title, and de&s;i|red it may be there taken into con&s;ideration, if aftewards it pa&s;s that Hou&s;e, then is writ|ten on the Bill, <HI>Les Communes ont a&s;&s;ent&egrave;z.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="44">When any one in the Commons Hou&s;e will &s;peak to a Bill, he &s;tands up unco|vered, and directs his Speech onely to the Speaker, then if what he delivers, be confuted by another, yet it is not allowed to an&s;wer again the &s;ame day, le&s;t the whole time &s;hould be &s;pent by two talkative per|&s;ons. Al&s;o if a Bill be debating in the Hou&s;e, no man may &s;peak to it in one day above once.</P>
<P>If any one &s;peak words of offence to the Kings Maje&s;ty, or to the Hou&s;e, he is cal|led to the Bar, and &s;ometimes &s;ent to the <HI>Tower.</HI> The Speaker is not allowed to per|&s;wade or di&s;&s;wade in pa&s;&s;ing of a Bill, but only to make a &s;hort and plain Narrative, nor to Vote except the Hou&s;e be equally di|vided.</P>
<P>After Dinner the Parliament ordinarily A&s;&s;embles not, though many times they continue &s;itting long in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Committees &s;it after dinner, where it is allowed to &s;peak, and reply as oft as they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the Lords Hou&s;e, they give their Suf|frages or Votes beginning at the <HI>Pui&s;ne</HI> or lowe&s;t Baron, and &s;o the re&s;t <HI>Seriatim,</HI> eve|ry one an&s;wering apart [<HI>content</HI>] or [<HI>not content.</HI>]</P>
<P>In the Hou&s;e of Commons they vote by <HI>Yea's and No's</HI> altogether, and if it be doubtful whether is the greater number, then the <HI>Yea</HI>'s, are to goe forth, and the <HI>No</HI>'s are to &s;it &s;till (becau&s;e the&s;e are con|tent

with their pre&s;ent condition, without any &s;uch addition or alteration of Laws as the other de&s;ire) and &s;ome are ap|pointed to number them, but at a Com|mittee, though it be of the whole Hou&s;e as is &s;ometimes, the <HI>Yea</HI>'s go on one &s;ide, and the <HI>No</HI>'s on the other,, whereby they may be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>If a Bill pa&s;s in one Hou&s;e, and being &s;ent to the other Hou&s;e, they demur upon it, then a Conference is demanded in the Painted Chamber, where certain deputed Members of each Hou&s;e meet, the Lords &s;itting covered at a Table, the Commons &s;tanding bare with great re&s;pect, where the bu&s;ine&s;s is debated: if they then agree not, that bu&s;ine&s;s is nulled, but if they agree then it is at la&s;t brought (with all other Bills which have pa&s;&s;ed in both Hou|&s;es) to the King, who comes again with His Crown on his Head, and clothed with His Royal Robes (&s;ometimes before His Plea|&s;ure is to prorogue or di&s;&s;olve them;) and being &s;eated in His Chair of State, and all the Lords in their Robes, the Clerk of the Crown reads the Title of each Bill, and as he reads, the Clerk of the Parliament, according to his in&s;tructions from the King, who before hath maturely con&s;idered each Bill, pronounceth the Royal A&s;&s;ent. If it be a publick Bill, the An&s;wer is [<HI>Le Roy le veut</HI>] which gives Life and Birth to that Bill that was before but an <HI>Em|brio.</HI> If a private Bill, the An&s;wer is [<HI>Soit fait comme il e&s;t de&s;ire</HI>] If it be a

publick Bill, which the King likes not, then the An&s;wer is [<HI>Le Roys' avi&s;era</HI>] which is taken for an ab&s;olute denyal in a more civil way, and that Bill wholly nulled. So that it is as true in <HI>England</HI> in &s;ome &s;ence, as in any Monarchy in the world, <HI>Quod Prin|cipi placuit legis habet vigorem,</HI> Not that whatever the King of <HI>England</HI> wills be|comes immediately a Law, but that nothing except what the King wills hath the force of a Law.</P>
<P>Note that the King without his per&s;onal pre&s;ence, can by Commi&s;&s;ion granted to &s;ome of his Nobles, give His Royal A&s;&s;ent to any Bill that requires ha&s;t.</P>
<P>If it be a Bill for Moneys given to His Maje&s;ty, then the an&s;wer is [<HI>Le Roy re|mercie &s;es loyaux &s;ujets, accepte leur Bene|volence, &amp; au&s;&s;i le veut</HI>] which antient Ceremorny of thanking the Subject for parting with their Money, &s;ome think might better be &s;pared, becau&s;e it intimates a di&s;tinct intere&s;t between the King and His Subjects, which is not onely fal&s;e, but ve|ry dangerous to be allowed of.

<P>The adjournments are u&s;ually made in the Lords Hou&s;e, by the Lord Keeper, in the Kings Name, to what other day the King plea&s;eth, and al&s;o to what other place if he think fit to remove them, as &s;ome|times hath been done, and then all things already debated and read in one or both Hou&s;es, continue to the next meeting in the &s;ame &s;tate, they were in before the adjournment, and &s;o may be re&s;umed.</P>
<P>In the like maner, the Parliament is Pro|rogued, but by a Prorogation there is a Se&s;&s;ion, and then the Bills that were al|mo&s;t ready in both Hou&s;es for the Royal A&s;&s;ent, not having it, mu&s;t at the rea&s;|&s;embling of the Parliament begin anew.</P>

<P>Note, That the King being head of the Parliament, if his death doth happen du|ring the &s;itting of the Parliament, it is, <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Antiently, after every Se&s;&s;ion of Parlia|ment the King commanded every Sheriff to proclaim the &s;everal Acts, and to cau&s;e them to be duly ob&s;erved, yet with|out that Proclamation, the Law intended that every one hath notice by his repre|&s;entative of what is tran&s;acted in Parlia|ment: of later times &s;ince Printing became common, that Cu&s;tom hath been laid a&s;ide.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Executive Power in Tem|poral Matters.</HEAD>
<P>A Brief account of the Legi&s;lative power in Temporall affairs, having been given, next may be con&s;idered the Executive power in tho&s;e affairs, and that is generally in the King, he is the Foun|tain of Ju&s;tice; he is the Fountain of Ju|&s;tice; he is the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England</HI>; and therefore as all the Laws of <HI>England</HI> are called the Kings Laws, becau&s;e he is <HI>Caput, Principium, &amp; Finis Parliamenti,</HI> by which the Laws are made, and that nothing can have the Force of a Law, but what he wills; &s;o all the Courts of Judicature are called the Kings Courts, and all the Judges of tho&s;e Courts are cal|led the Kings Judges.</P>
<P>The highe&s;t Court of Judicature in <HI>Eng|land</HI> is the Hou&s;e of Lords in Parliament; &s;o that the Parliament is not only <HI>Conci|lium,</HI> but <HI>Curia,</HI> a Court of Judicature, con&s;i&s;ting as aforementioned, of all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, as Judges; and the&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ted with the mo&s;t grave and eminent Lawyers of <HI>England</HI> both in Com|mon and Civil Law.</P>
<P>To the Judicature of this Supreme and mo&s;t Honourable Court, all other Courts and Per&s;ons that are Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> are Subject and accountable for all Crimes

not properly tryable, remediable, or pu|ni&s;hable in other inferiour Courts of Ju&s;|tice; and to this Court all la&s;t Appeals are to be made, and from who&s;e Sentence there lies no appeal, but to a &s;ucceeding Parlia|ment; and this &s;upreme Judicatory or Ju|dicial Power lyes only in the King and Hou&s;e of Lords; and at the Bar of this High Court may the Hou&s;e of Commons, as the Grand Inque&s;t of the Nation, im|peach the highe&s;t Subject of <HI>England,</HI> whe|ther of the Clergy, or of the Laity, and pro&s;ecute them till it come to a Sentence, after which there can be no farther procee|ding, till the King informed of the whole matter, gives His Royal A&s;&s;ent for the Exe|cution of the &s;aid Sentence, or grant His gracious Pardon.</P>
<P>In the late Long Parliament, the Hou&s;e of Commons pretended to be al&s;o a Court of Judicature, and at length u&s;urped a mo&s;t exorbitant power to the total ruine of Monarchical Government, and it is worth ob&s;erving by what Gradations they arrived thereto. In the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and not before, the Commons began to take upon them (as &s;aith Mr. <HI>Pryn,</HI> a learned Member of that Hou&s;e) to &s;eclude one another for undue Elections; whereas formerly the King and Lords were accounted the &s;ole Judges of all Members of the Commons Hou&s;e, and to have the &s;ole power to judge of their undue Elections, Returns, Mi&s;demeanors, Breaches of Privileges, and of all other

<P>In the time of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr the Commons went farther, took upon them ut|terly to expel out of their Hou&s;e &s;ome of their fellow Members, as Projectors and Monopolizers, although they had been duly elected: After this in the &s;ame Kings time, they expelled all &s;uch as adhered in Loyalty to the King; next they &s;ecluded and impri&s;oned all &s;uch as the Officers of the late rebellious Army impeached, or di&s;liked; then by the help of that Army, 50 or 60 of the Members of that Hou&s;e expelled all the re&s;t of their fellows, and &s;oon after, voted down the King and whole Hou&s;e of Lords, and voted them&s;elves to be the Parliament; to be the &s;ole Legi&s;la|tors and the Supreme Authority of <HI>Eng|land</HI>; into &s;uch a prodigious height of folly and impiety do men run, when they, once allow them&s;elves to pa&s;s their, due li|mits.</P>

This Book is kept under three Locks and Keys, not to be lookt into under 6s. 8d. and for every line tran&s;cribed is to be paid 4d.</P>
<P>Next is the <HI>Auditor</HI> of the Receipts, Sir <HI>Robert Long,</HI> who&s;e Office is to file the Bills of the Tellers, whereby they charge them&s;elves with all moneys received, and to draw all Orders to be &s;igned by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, for i&s;&s;u|ing forth all moneys by vertue of Privy Seals, which are recorded and lodged in his Office. He al&s;o makes debentures to the &s;everal Per&s;ons, who have Fees, An|nuities, or Pen&s;ions by Letters Patents from the King out of the Exchequer, and di|rects them for payment to the Tellers. He receives every week the &s;tate of the ac|count of each Teller, and al&s;o weekly certifies the whole to the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury, who immediately pre&s;ent the e&s;timate or Ballance to the King.

<P>Next there are four Tellers, <HI>Laurence Squib, John Loving</HI> E&s;quires, Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> aforementioned, and Sir <HI>Willi|am Doily</HI> Kt. Their Office is to receive all moneys due to the King; and thereupon to throw down a Bill through a Pipe into the Tally Court, where it is received by the Auditors Clerk, who there attends to write the words of the &s;aid Bill upon a Tally, and then deliver the &s;ame to be en|tred by the Clerk of the Pells, or his un|der Clerk, who there attends to enter it in his Book: then the Tally is cloven by the two Deputy Chamberlains, who have their Seals, and while the Senior Deputy reads one part, the Junior examines the other part with the other two Clerks.</P>
<P>Clerk of the Pells is <HI>William Wardour</HI> E&s;quire, who&s;e Office is to enter every Tellers Bill into a Parchment skin, (in La|tin <HI>Pellis,</HI> whence this Office hath its name,) all receipts and payments for the King, for what cau&s;e, or by whom &s;oever, and is in nature of a Comtroller, hath four Clerks, whereof one is for the <HI>Intro|itus,</HI> and another for the <HI>Exitus.</HI> More|over he is to make weekly, and half year|ly Books, both of the Receipts and Pay|ments, which are delivered to the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of the Trea&s;ury.</P>

<P>He that payes the King any moneys, re|ceives for his Acquittance a Tally, that is, the one half of a &s;tick cloven with certain proportionable Notches thereon, expre&s;|&s;ive of the &s;um from the &s;aid Deputy Cham|berlains, who keep the other cloven part of the &s;tick called the Foyl, and deliver it to the Tally-Joyners on the other &s;ide of the Exchequer, who are al&s;o Deputies to the Chamberlains, and they joyn it with the Foyl, which agreeing, they give it their Te&s;t, and &s;end it by an Officer of their own to the Pipe where their <HI>Quietus e&s;t</HI> is engro&s;&s;ed in Parchment.</P>
<P>Other Officers in the Exchequer are the two U&s;hers, <HI>Robert</HI> and <HI>Philip Pack|er</HI> E&s;quires, who&s;e Office is to take care to &s;ecure the Exchequer by day and by night, and all the Avenues leading to the fame, and to furni&s;h all nece&s;&s;aries, as Books, Paper, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Though the number of Officers in the Exchequer is far greater than in any other of the Kings Courts, yet not near &s;o great as the Financiers and other Officers be|longing to the Revenues of the French King, who are &s;o many, that their Fees eat up three parts in four of the whole Re|venue: whereas for rewarding all the Of|ficers in the Engli&s;h Exchequer, whereof mo&s;t are ever per&s;ons of E&s;tates, Parts, and great Integrity, it co&s;ts the King a very in|con&s;iderable &s;um of money, as will ea&s;ily appear to any one who &s;hall con&s;ider that in ca&s;e of a gift from the King of Moneys or Pen&s;ion out o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Exchequer, he that receives it pays but 5 <HI>l. per cent.</HI> among&s;t the Tellers, Auditors, Clerk of the Pells, and their Clerks, and to all other Officers what&s;oever; and which is remarkable, there goes not among&s;t the &s;aid Officers and Clerks &s;o much as 5 <HI>s. per cent.</HI> out of publick Payments, as for the Navy, Ord|nance, Wardrobe, Mint, to the Cofferer.

<P>The bringing in of all moneys to the King co&s;ts his Maje&s;ty among&s;t Receivers, Collectors, and all others in the Country not above 2 <HI>s.</HI> in the pound; and at his Exchequer it co&s;ts him in a manner nothing at all; for the Tellers, who are bound to the King in 20000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ecurity, for the true di&s;charge of their great tru&s;ts, have under 33 <HI>l. per an.</HI> for their Salary from the King, and the two Clerks of each Teller, who con&s;tantly attend their Offices, have no|thing at all from the King.</P>

Fir&s;t, the <HI>Aborigenes</HI> or <HI>Ancient Britains</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;t thereof, (as Mr. <HI>Selden</HI> makes appear) and in their Right, the <HI>Romans</HI> held it; then the <HI>Saxons</HI> having gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>England,</HI> kept that Dominion, their King <HI>Edgar,</HI> among&s;t His Royal Titles, calling Him&s;elf, <HI>Sove|raign of the Narrow Seas.</HI></P>
<P>Afterward the <HI>Normans</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>Eng|land,</HI> claimed, and quietly po&s;&s;e&s;t the &s;ame Dominion, in te&s;timony whereof, the <HI>Swedes, Danes, Hans-Towns, Hollanders, Zealanders, &amp;c.</HI> were wont to ask leave to pa&s;s the <HI>Briti&s;h Seas,</HI> and to take Licen&s;es to fi&s;h therein: And to this day, do &s;trike Sail to all the Ships of War belonging to the King of <HI>England,</HI> as oft as they pa&s;s by any one of them, thereby to expre&s;s, that they acknowledge the Soveraignty of the <HI>Briti&s;h Seas</HI> to belong to the King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> according to an Ordinance made at <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> by <HI>John,</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> about Four hundred and fifty years ago.</P>
<P>To maintain this Right and Title, to protect Trade, to &s;ubdue Pirates, to de|fend this Kingdom again&s;t ho&s;tile Inva&s;ions,
<PB N="165" REF="94">
and to reduce foreign Potentates to Rea&s;on, the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have had (e&s;pecially of later times) a con&s;iderable number of Ships of War, for Strength, for Beauty and Sailing (if not for number) &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all tho&s;e of our Neighbor Nations: For Strength, by rea&s;on of the mo&s;t excellent <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Timber, they are like &s;o many floating Ca&s;tles and <HI>Barbicans:</HI> For Beau|ty, &s;o proportionably and &s;paciou&s;ly built, and &s;o curiou&s;ly and richly adorned, that they are as &s;o many <HI>Royal Palaces.</HI> A|mong&s;t other Ships at Sea, they are as &s;o many Lions among&s;t other &s;illy Bea&s;ts, or as Eagles among&s;t other Birds.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tories mention a great Fleet of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> a Fleet of the forementioned King <HI>Edgar,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of Three thou&s;and &s;ix hundred Sail; a Fleet of <HI>Lewis,</HI> Son to <HI>Philip</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> of Six hundred Sail, that arrived at <HI>Sandwich</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h Barons</HI> again&s;t King <HI>John</HI>; but tho&s;e doubtle&s;s were but as &s;o many Cot|tages to Ca&s;tles, in re&s;pect of the pre&s;ent Ships of War.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, in the Fifth year of His Reign, built a Ship, then accounted the greate&s;t, that ever had been &s;een in <HI>England,</HI> and named it <HI>Henry Grace de Dieu,</HI> or the <HI>Great Henry</HI>; it was of One thou&s;and Tun.</P>
<P>In the Eighth year of King <HI>James</HI> was built by the <HI>Londoners,</HI> a Ship of Twelve hundred Tun, and called <HI>The Trades In|crea&s;e,</HI> which being lo&s;t in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI>
<PB N="166" REF="95">
King <HI>James</HI> cau&s;ed another to be built of Fourteen hundred Tun, which being given to Prince <HI>Henry,</HI> was by Him named the <HI>Prince.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Charles,</HI> the <HI>Martyr,</HI> perceiving the great encrea&s;e of Shipping in our Neighbor Nations, and that the Soveraign|ty of the&s;e Seas was like to be di&s;puted; among&s;t other great Ships of War, built one greater then any Ship of War, either in <HI>England,</HI> or in any Countrey of <HI>Europe,</HI> and named it <HI>The Royal Soveraign</HI>; which for a little diver&s;ion, &s;hall here be more particularly de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Royal Soveraign,</HI> being a Ship of the Fir&s;t Rate or Rank, built in the Year One thou&s;and &s;ix hundred thirty and &s;even, is in length by the Keel One hundred twenty &s;even Foot, in bredth by the Beam Forty &s;even Foot, in depth Forty nine Foot, her draught of Water Twenty one Foot: Of burden, in all Two thou&s;and &s;eventy and two Tuns; and One thou&s;and five hundred fifty and four Tuns, be&s;ides Guns, Tackle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This mighty Moving-Ca&s;tle hath Six Anchors, whereof the bigge&s;t weighs 6000 <HI>l.</HI> and the lea&s;t 4300 <HI>l.</HI> It hath Fourteen Cables, whereof the greate&s;t is Twenty one Inches in compa&s;s, and weighs 9000 <HI>l.</HI> Her lea&s;t Cable being eight Inches in compa&s;s, weighing near 1300 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>To the <HI>Royal Soveraign</HI> belong Eigh|teen Ma&s;ts and Yards, whereof the great|e&s;t, called <HI>The Main Ma&s;t,</HI> is One hundred

The weight of the Sea &s;tore, in point of Ground Tackle and other Cordage, is Sixty Tuns, Eight hundred and odd pounds.</P>
<P>She carries a long Boat of Fifty Foot, a Pinnace of Thirty &s;ix Foot, and a Skiff of Twenty &s;even Foot long.</P>
<P>The weight of her Rigging is Three and thirty Tun.</P>
<P>She hath Three Tire of Guns, all of Bra&s;s, whereof there are Forty four in her upper Tire, Thirty four in her &s;econd Tire, and Twenty two in her lower Tire, in all One hundred Guns.</P>
<P>She carries in all, of Officers, Soldiers, and Mariners, Seven hundred Men.</P>
<P>Finally, Her whole Charges for Wages, Victuals, Ammunition, wear and tear, for every Moneth at Sea, co&s;ts the King 3500 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, as hath been computed by a very skilful per&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="96">The charges of Building a Ship of the Fir&s;t Rate, together with Guns, Tackle, and Rigging (be&s;ides Victualing) doth or|dinarily amount to about 62432 <HI>l.</HI> Tho&s;e of Lower Rates proportionally.</P>
<P>The King hath now Six Ships of the Fir&s;t Rate, whereof Five are longer by the Keel then the forementioned <HI>Royal Soveraign,</HI> and all of the &s;ame force, except two, which yet may carry each one, One hundred and ten Guns.</P>

<P>The&s;e Societies are no Corporations, nor have any Judicial Power over their Members, but have certain Orders among them&s;elves, which have, by con&s;ent, the Force of Laws: For lighter offences they are onely excommoned, or put out of Com|mons, not to eat with the re&s;t; and for greater offences they lo&s;e their Chambers, and are expelled the Colledge; and being once expelled, they are never received by any of the Three other Societies.

<P>The&s;e al&s;o, when they meet at Chappel or Hall, or at Courts of Ju&s;tice, wear a grave black-Robe and Cap, at other times walk with Cloak and Sword.</P>
<P>There are no Lands or Revenues belong to the&s;e Societies, which being no Corpo|rations, are not enabled to purcha&s;e, not have they any thing for defraying the charges of the Hou&s;e, but what is paid at Admittances, and Quit-Rents for their Chambers.</P>
<P>The whole Company of Gentlemen in each Society, may be divided into Four parts, Benchers, Utter Barri&s;ters, Inner Barri&s;ters, and Students.</P>

<P>Utter Barri&s;ters are &s;uch, as, For their Learning and Standing, are called by the Benchers to plead and argue in the Society doubtful Ca&s;es and Que&s;tions, which are called <HI>Moots</HI> (from meeting the old <HI>Saxon</HI> word for the <HI>French A&s;&s;emble,</HI> or el&s;e from the <HI>French Mot</HI> a word.) And while&s;t they argue the &s;aid Ca&s;es, they &s;it uttermo&s;t on the Forms or Benches, which they call the Bar.</P>

<P>All the re&s;t are accounted Inner Bar|ri&s;ters, who for want of Learning or Time, are not to argue in the&s;e Moots; and yet in a Moot before the Benchers, two of the&s;e Inner Barri&s;ters &s;itting on the &s;ame Form with the Utter Barri&s;ters, do for their Ex|erci&s;es recite by heart the pleading of the &s;ame Moot Ca&s;e in <HI>Law French</HI>; which Pleading is the Declaration, at large, of the &s;aid Moot-Ca&s;e; the one taking the part of the Plaintiff, and the other of the Defendant.</P>

<P>The Benchers appoint the elde&s;t Utter Barre&s;ter to read among&s;t them openly in the Hall, whereof he hath notice half a year before.

<P>In the Four Innes of Court are reckoned about 800 Students.</P>

<P>To arrive to this high Degree, take this brief account.</P>
<P>The young Student in the Common Law, being born of a Gentile Stock, and bred two or three years in the Univer&s;ity, and there chiefly ver&s;ed in Logick and Rheto|rick, both expedient for a Lawyer, and gotten &s;ome in&s;ight into the Civil Law, and &s;ome skill in the French Tongue, as well as Latin, he is admitted to be one of the Four Innes of Court, where he is fir&s;t called a Moot man, and after about Seven years &s;tudy, is cho&s;en an Utter Ba|ri&s;ter, and having then &s;pent Twelve years more, and performed the Exerci&s;es before mentioned, he is cho&s;en a Bencher, and &s;ome time after a Reader: during the Read|ing which heretofore was Three weeks and Three days, the Reader keeps a con&s;tant and &s;umptuous Fea&s;ting, inviting the chief Nobles, Judges, Bi&s;hops, great Of|ficers of the Kingdom, and &s;ometimes the King him&s;elf (as that mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Lawyer, the pre&s;ent Atturney General did) that it co&s;ts them &s;ometimes 800 or 1000 <HI>l.</HI>

<P>When the number of Sergeants is &s;mall, the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas, by the advice and con&s;ent of the other Judges, make choice of Six or Eight, more or le&s;s, of the mo&s;t Grave and Lear|ned of the Innes of Court, and pre&s;ents their Names to the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, who &s;ends by the Kings Writ, to each of them to appear on &s;uch a day before the King, to receive the State and Degree of Sergeant at Law; at the appointed time, they being habited in Robes of two colours, <HI>viz.</HI> Brown and Blew; come accompanyed with the Stu|dents of the Innes of Court, and atten|ded by a train of Servants and Retainers, in certain peculiar cloth Liveries, to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter-Hall,</HI> there in publick take a &s;o|lemn Oath, and are clothed with certain Robes and Coyfs, without which they may no more be &s;een in publick; after this they fea&s;t the great per&s;ons of the Nation, in a very magnificent and Prince|ly manner, give Gold Rings to the Prin|ces of the Blood, Archbi&s;hops, Chancel|lor and Trea&s;urer, to the value of Forty &s;hillings each Ring: to Earles, Bi&s;hops, Rings of Twenty &s;hillings: to other great Officers, to Barons, great Prelates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Rings of le&s;s value.</P>

<P>When any of the aforementioned Judg|es are wanting, the King by advice of His Council, makes choice of one of the&s;e Sergeants at Law, to &s;upply his place, and con&s;titutes him by Letters Patents, Sealed by the Chancellor, who &s;itting in the middle of the re&s;t of the Judges in open Court, by a &s;et Speech declares to the Sergeant (that upon this occa&s;ion is brought in) the Kings plea&s;ure, and to the people, the Kings goodne&s;s, in providing the Bench with &s;uch able hone&s;t men, as that Ju&s;tice may be done expeditely and impartially to all His Subjects, and then cau&s;es the &s;aid Letters Patents to be read; and being departed, the Chief Ju&s;tice pla|ces the &s;aid Sergeant on the Bench, <HI>ju|nior</HI> of all the re&s;t; and having taken his Oath well and truly to &s;erve the King and His people in the Office of Ju&s;tice, to take no reward, to do equal and &s;peedy

<P>ALthough Degrees in the Civil Law may be had onely in <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and the Theory be&s;t there to be acquired; yet the Practice thereof, is mo&s;t of all in <HI>London,</HI> where a Colledge was long &s;ince purcha&s;ed by Dr. <HI>Henry Harvey,</HI> Dean of the Arches, for the Profe&s;&s;ors of the Civil Law in this City; and where commonly did re&s;ide the Judge of the Arches, the Judge of the Admiralty, and the Judge of the Preroga|tive Court, with divers other eminent Civilians, who there living (for Diet and Lodging) in a Collegiate manner, and Commoning together, it was u&s;ually known by the name of <HI>Doctors Commons,</HI> and &s;tood near S. <HI>Pauls,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of S. <HI>Bennets Pauls-Wharf</HI>; which being con|&s;umed by the late dreadful Fire, they now all re&s;ide at <HI>Exeter</HI> Hou&s;e in the <HI>Strand,</HI> in the &s;ame manner (until their Hou&s;e be rebuilt) and keep there their &s;everal Courts and Pleadings every Term, which begins and ends almo&s;t at the &s;ame time with the Term at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>

<P>He fitteth alone without any A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and heareth and determineth all Cau&s;es, without any Jury of Twelve Men, as is nece&s;&s;ary in Common Law Courts.</P>
<P>To this Court belongeth an Actuary, a Regi&s;ter, and a Beadle.</P>
<P>The Office of the Actuary is to attend the Court, &s;et down the Judges Decrees, Regi&s;ter the Acts of the Court, and &s;end them in Books to the Regi&s;try. This Office is enjoyed by <HI>John Clements,</HI> Batchelor of Laws, and Publick Notary.</P>

<P>The Beadle attends the Court, carrieth a Mace before the Judge, and calls the Per&s;ons cited to appear.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are allowed to be Advocates, and plead in this Court, are all to be Doctors of the Civil Law, in one of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Univer&s;ities; who upon their Peti|tion to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and his <HI>Fiat</HI> obtained, are admitted by the Judge of this Court, upon condition not

<P>The manner of their Admittance is thus, The Two Senior Advocates in their Scarlet Robes, with the Mace before them, con|duct him up to the Court, with three low Reverences, and pre&s;ent him with a &s;hort Latin Speech, and the Re&s;cript of the Archbi&s;hop: Then the Oaths of Allegi|ance, Supremacy, and &s;ome other pre|&s;cribed in the Statute of the Arches, being taken, he is admitted by the Judge, and a place or &s;eat in the Court a&s;&s;igned unto him, which he is always to keep when he pleads.</P>
<P>The Judge and all the Advocates, in this Court, always wear their Scarlet Robes, with Hoods lined with Taffata, if they be of <HI>Oxford</HI>; or White Minever Fur, if of <HI>Cambridge</HI>; and all round, Black Velvet-Caps.</P>

<P>To &s;peak now particularly of the Pub|lick Schools in <HI>Oxford,</HI> of the large Salary to each Publick Profe&s;&s;or, of the mo&s;t famous <HI>Bodlean Library,</HI> that for number of choice Books, curious Manu&s;cripts, di|ver&s;ity of Languages, liberty of Studying, facility of finding of any Book, equals, if not &s;urpa&s;&s;es, the famous <HI>Vatican:</HI> To &s;peak of the curious Architecture, and va&s;t charges of the New Theater, fabricked by the mo&s;t ingenious Dr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren,</HI> at the &s;ole co&s;t and charges of the mo&s;t Reverend Father in God, <HI>Gilbert,</HI> the pre&s;ent Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> for the u&s;e of Schola&s;tick Exerci&s;es, and of that mo&s;t excellent Printing Pre&s;s there.

<P>What hath been &s;aid of <HI>Oxford,</HI> the like may be &s;aid of Her Si&s;ter <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which for Antiquity, Beautiful Colledges, large Revenues, good Di&s;cipline, number of Students, plenty of Diet, and of all other things nece&s;&s;ary for advancement of Learning (if in complai&s;ance &s;he will at any time give place to <HI>Oxford,</HI> yet at the &s;ame time) will challenge precedence be|fore any other Univer&s;ity of the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the two glorious Fountains of Learning, to the fame whereof, Foreigners come on Pilgrimage to offer up Honor and Admiration; and yet, even the&s;e had lately been like to be dried up, by the over-heated Zeal of &s;ome ignorant Fana|ticks.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the cheife&s;t Store-hou&s;es of Lettered Men, which &s;ends forth yearly a great number of Divines, Civilians, Phy|&s;itians, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;erve all parts of this King|dom.</P>
<P>To &s;upply the&s;e great Store-hou&s;es, there are in &s;everal parts of <HI>England,</HI> Grammar Schools, whereof the principal are <HI>Pauls, We&s;tmin&s;ter, Winche&s;ter, Eaton, Merchant-Taylers,</HI> the <HI>Charter-hou&s;e,</HI> all richly en|dowed to maintain Ma&s;ters, U&s;hers, and a certain number of Scholars; &s;o that a childe once admitted into the&s;e Schools,
<PB N="296" REF="160">
if he become capable, may at length be preferred to be Scholar or Fellow in &s;ome Colledge of one of the&s;e Univer&s;ities, and will want little or no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his Parents, all his life time after.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are of late Grammar Schools founded and endowed, in almo&s;t every Market Town of <HI>England,</HI> wherein the children of the Town are onely to be taught <HI>gratis,</HI> without any other allowance. But in the multiplying of the&s;e Schools, it may be doubted, whether there appeared not more Zeal then Prudence; for the Parents of &s;uch School-boys, not able to advance them to the Univer&s;ities, all the re&s;t, be&s;ides Reading and Writing, becomes u&s;ele&s;s; and the Youths, by Eight or ten years lazy living, rendred unapt for the la|bor belonging to the more profitable Plough, and divers Manufactures, u&s;ually turn either Serving-men, or Clerks to Ju&s;tices or Lawyers, whereby they learn much Chi|canery, they become cunning Petty-foggers, multiply Law-&s;utes, and cozen their Coun|trey; or, if perhaps they are &s;et to Trades, that little &s;mattering in Learning, got at the Grammar School, renders them com|monly proud, &s;tiff-necked, &s;elf-conceited, unapt to be governed, apt to embrace every new Doctrine, Here&s;ie, Schi&s;m, Sect, and Faction: Or, in ca&s;e their Parents are able to put them to the Univer&s;ity, yet for want of &s;ufficient maintenance and re&s;idence there, they get onely to be half-learned, and thereby a propen&s;ity to Preach Faction,

Sedition, and Rebellion, to &s;educe tho&s;e that are more ignorant then them&s;elves, as was evident in our late unhappy troubles, where it was ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Seducers</HI> were generally &s;uch as had been from tho&s;e Market Latin Schools, advanced to be either Commoners or Servitors, for a &s;hort time in the Univer&s;ity; and the &s;educed, ordinarily, &s;uch as from tho&s;e Schools be|came afterward Shop-keepers or Petty-foggers. If &s;uch had been endowed with more or perhaps with le&s;s knowledge, they had probably been much more humble, loyal, and obedient, to their Governors, both Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical; and there|fore, the late King of <HI>Spain</HI> con&s;ulting with his able&s;t Coun&s;ellors of State for a general Reformation of Matters that were found, by experience, to be inconvenient and pre|judicial to His Kingdoms; after mature deliberation, came to this re&s;olution, That among&s;t other abu&s;es, the great number of Countrey Grammar Schools &s;hould by a &s;olemn <HI>Prematica</HI> or <HI>Ordnance</HI> be dimini&s;h|ed, and the childrens time better employed at Manufactures, Trades, Husbandry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Be&s;ides, upon &s;erious con&s;ideration, it will be found that <HI>England</HI> is over-&s;tocked with Scholars for the proportion of its Prefer|ments, and for its employments for Letter|ed Per&s;ons, whereby it comes to pa&s;s that too many live di&s;contented, and longing for Innovations and Changes, and watch|ing for an opportunity to alter the Govern|ment both of Church and State.</P>
