<HEAD>THE <HI>Secret Intrigues</HI> OF THE COURT of <HI>FRANCE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THat which we call the Policy of a State, very nearly re&s;embles the Oeconomy of a Private Family: the Mini&s;ters and Trea|&s;ury-Officers of the One, are like the Steward and Caterer in the Other. And therefore it was, that an Ancient Author made no difficulty to &s;ay, <HI>That a Politick Court &s;upported the State,</HI> in like manner as Oeconomy kept up the Grandeur and good Di&s;cipline of a &s;ingle Hou&s;e. And as there are two &s;orts of Oeconomy; the one Hone&s;t, and Prai&s;e|worthy, the other Mechanick and Sordid, which a Lunatick Per&s;on makes u&s;e of to pile up Riches any manner of way, thereby rendring him&s;elf odious to all Men of worth, 'tis very near the &s;ame thing with Policy, which may be al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd into two Cla&s;&s;es, the one Lawful, the other Illegitimate. Which latter having only u&s;urp'd the Name of Po|licy as U&s;urpation has done, conceals it &s;elf under the Appellation of Conque&s;t, On the other &s;ide, True Policy is not only beneficial but commendable,
<PB N="2" REF="3"> and permitted by the Laws of God and Man. She is the Daughter of Prudence, and the Prince that makes u&s;e of her Profitably and Sincerely, wins to him&s;elf by that means, the Admiration of Foreigners, as well as the Love and Re&s;pect of his own Sub|jects; and frequently merits the Epithetes and Sir|names of Great, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e.

Nor can I forbear divulging to the World that the Court of <HI>France,</HI> ever &s;ince the Death of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. has very much &s;tudied the Practice of this &s;ame fal&s;e Policy, on purpo&s;e to endeavour the Aggrandizing of her &s;elf by Cheat and U&s;urpation. And it may be &s;aid to have had extraordinary Succe&s;s in this la&s;t Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. under a fal&s;e Idea of Conque&s;t, having thereby augmented his Reve|nues to above two Thirds, and his Dominions above a Third Part; as might be ea&s;ily prov'd, were it not vi&s;ible to all his Neighbours, or if his Neighbours were not &s;en&s;ible of it by woful Experience. And I do farther averr, that it was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>France</HI> to aggrandize her &s;elf, and every way to en|large her Dominions as now we &s;ee her Limits ex|tended, or for her Monarch to rai&s;e him&s;elf to the pre&s;ent Pinacle of Grandeur, had &s;he not made a &s;mart u&s;e of Violence, U&s;urpation &amp; Breach of Faith.
<PB N="3" REF="3"> To which I may moreover add, the Hypocri&s;ie and Deceit which the King of <HI>France</HI> has us'd in the&s;e latter times of Religion, on purpo&s;e to trample un|der foot and appropriate to him&s;elf the E&s;tates of his Subjects; and the Treacherous Leagues he has made with Foreign Princes the more ea&s;ily to de|ceive 'em, and lay hold upon favourable Oppor|tunities to invade their Territories, when lea&s;t they dream'd of any &s;uch thing, but lay repo&s;ing under the Security of a Peace; and all this to make him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter of their Dominions, when it was not in the Power of their Allies to a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em. Formerly indeed the <HI>Romans,</HI> who were Pagans, made u&s;e of the &s;ame Maxims and the &s;ame Stratagems to grow great upon their Neighbours, and to make them|&s;elves univer&s;al Ma&s;ters of the World. And now <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. believes he cannot fail of obtaining the &s;ame Succe&s;s in his va&s;t Expectations by treading the &s;ame laudable and worthy Steps.</P>
<P>We have &s;een, that &s;ince the Church-Men, for mo&s;t part greedy Heapers of Wealth, have intru|ded into the Mini&s;try of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> they have in&s;till'd into the Government Sentiments like their own; that is to &s;ay, Sentiments of U&s;urpa|tion and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and a Liberty to do what|ever they plea&s;e: and as it is u&s;ually &s;een, that a Ma&s;ter endeavours to bring up his Di&s;ciples in his own Sentiments, and to be of his humour; &s;o the Cardinals of <HI>Richlieu</HI> and <HI>Mazarine</HI> in&s;pir'd into <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. eager De&s;ires to make them&s;elves Great by U&s;urpation, infu&s;ing into 'em by all the ways imaginable, that a Prince was always cry'd up in his Undertakings, let 'em be good or bad provided that they pro&s;per'd in their Enterprizes,
<PB N="4" REF="4"> becau&s;e the People adore, and like the Sun-flower, turn toward the Glitter of Pro&s;perity. That it was neither nece&s;&s;ary nor beneficial for a King to be good, &s;incere or merciful, only that 'twas &s;ufficient to appear &s;o; in regard it was frequently dangerous to be &s;o indeed; and for that it became a King above all things, to be always his own Ma&s;ter, by acting quite the contrary, when his Affairs requir'd it, whether it were to make him&s;elf Great, or for his own Ho|nour; &s;eeing that Men judge rather by the Eyes then by the Hands; every body having the Liber|ty to behold and con&s;ider the Actions of Kings, but not to handle 'em; that is, to examine and dive into 'em; tho&s;e are My&s;teries conceal'd, like the Oracles of the <HI>Pagans</HI> in times of Old. <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV is &s;o &s;trongly per&s;waded that the People are only taken with Appearances, and gaudy Shew, that he affects no more then only to appear out|wardly hone&s;t, &s;incere and Religious; when in reality and at the bottom of his Soul there is nothing of all this in him, as has been &s;een by all the World, ever &s;ince his fir&s;t coming to the Crown. Seeing there is no better way to judge of the Inward Heart then by the Con&s;tancy of a Mans outward Actions; then which there can be nothing more plain, if we con&s;ider the Opre&s;&s;ions, the Exacti|ons, the Cruelties committed during the whole Cour&s;e of his Reign, as al&s;o his U&s;urpations upon his Neighbours. Nor can the more Moderate of his Subjects alledge any thing fairer in his Excu&s;e, then only this, that his De&s;ign is to aggrandize him&s;elf; and that this is the &s;ure&s;t Means to render him&s;elf formidable as well to his Friends as to his Enemies both at home and abroad. Therefore to
<PB N="5" REF="4"> become Great according to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Fourteenth's Method, there was a Nece&s;&s;ity for him to fail of his Word and Faith, &s;o &s;oon as he found the Keeping of either prejudicial to Him; to break his Alliances concluded and &s;olemnly &s;worn with his Neighbours and neare&s;t Relations, &s;o &s;oon as an Opportunity pre&s;ented it &s;elf to invade their Territories. It may be &s;aid, that this Monarch has made an excellent U&s;e of Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s Le&s;&s;ons. For that &s;ame Prelate being both Crafty and Cunning, and &s;ome|what of a Cheat be&s;ides, fail d not frequently to lay before his Prince the Example of <HI>Alexander</HI> VI. who notwith&s;tanding his being the Vicar of Chri&s;t, never forbore to fal&s;ify his Word, when he found there was a nece&s;&s;ity for it: tho' never any man promis'd things with more &s;olemn Oaths, and his Deceit prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful to him: Nor was <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> and <HI>Aragon,</HI> beholding for his Grandeur to any thing, &s;o much as to his Breach of Faith. The Emperour, <HI>Charles</HI> V. was always wont to &s;wear <HI>By the Faith of a Man of Honour,</HI> when he had a De&s;ign to act contrary to what he promis'd. This <HI>Mazarine</HI> maintain'd as a Maxim never to be contradicted, and that it behov'd a Soveraign to ob&s;erve this Rule, if ever he de&s;ign'd Grandeur and Pui&s;&s;ance, never to &s;tick to, or govern him&s;elf according to the e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Laws of a Monarchy, when they agreed not with his pre&s;ent Intere&s;t, and the Politicks requi&s;ite to enlarge his Power: becau&s;e the &s;ame Laws that were made in former Ages, were good and whole|&s;om at that time, but could not always &s;o continue. As much as to &s;ay, that a King may break and trample over the Fundamental Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of a Realm, when they concur not with his Ambition and his
<PB N="6" REF="5"> Inclination to plunder his Neighbours, and ruin his Subjects. For this rea&s;on it is, that for &s;ome Years &s;ince, we have &s;een <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. practi&s;e all the&s;e Maxims with a vehement Swing, but with little Circum&s;pe|ction; con&s;ulting neither the Laws of his King|dom, nor the Prerogatives of other Princes. How|ever ob&s;erving this Rule, never to threaten before|hand, but to execute his De&s;ign at the &s;ame time that he &s;et forth his <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> that his Adver&s;ary might have no time or lei&s;ure to oppo&s;e his Tor|rent.</P>
<P>Moreover, Men judge of the Inclinations of Princes by the Mini&s;ters and Great Per&s;onages that are in favour near their Per&s;ons: and the Deceas'd Prince of <HI>Orange, William</HI> the Fir&s;t, was wont to &s;ay in his time, with great Rea&s;on and upon &s;olid Grounds, That a True Judgment might be given of the Natural Di&s;po&s;ition of <HI>Philip</HI> II. King of <HI>Spain</HI> by the Cruelties which the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> his Chief Mini&s;ter committed without fear of puni&s;hment in the <HI>Low-Countries.</HI> If it may be lawful to &s;ay the &s;ame thing of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV, What Sentiment ought we to have of that Prince? If we look narrowly into the Inclinations and Proceedings of the Mini|&s;ters that have &s;erv'd him all the whole time of his Reign, to begin from <HI>Mazarine</HI> till this very time, we &s;hall find 'em to have been all Birds of Prey, and mo&s;t Cruel and In&s;atiable Blood &s;uckers of the People, Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> was the Fir&s;t who laid the Foundations of this Policy now practis'd by the Court of <HI>France:</HI> For that &s;ame Mini&s;ter abu&s;ing the Simplicity of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. made him&s;elf ab&s;o|lute Ma&s;ter in the Kingdom. He was naturally Vio|lent, nor could he endure any Companion; all
<PB N="7" REF="5"> People mu&s;t &s;ubmit to Him; He Exil'd, and Im|pri&s;on'd; he cunningly got rid of the Baron <HI>d'Ancre,</HI> of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Thou</HI> and <HI>Cinqmarc;</HI> cho&s;e rather to e&s;tabli&s;h the Security of his Per&s;on and his Fortune by Rigour and Violence, then to hazard either by Clemency, or by too much Complacency with tho&s;e that were belov'd by the King, and &s;o he triumph'd over all, even over the Prote&s;tant Party, which was very numerous in <HI>France,</HI> and which he endea|vour'd to oppre&s;s by all manner of ways, again&s;t the Edicts of Pacification, and ruin'd 'em all by ruining <HI>Rochell;</HI> which that he might the better bring to pa&s;s, he deceiv'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who in good Policy were bound to have ventur'd all to have pre&s;erv'd that Important Place, which was another State within the State it &s;elf, and was a kind of Sanctuary and Place of Retreat for all the Malecontents of the Court. And it may be &s;aid that the Lo&s;s of that City was the Source of all the Calamities that befell <HI>Charles</HI> the I. King of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> For <HI>France</HI> not only rais'd the Tempe&s;t in the two Kingdoms of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> &s;ent Mo|ney into <HI>England</HI> to Kindle the Fire, and feed the Civil War, but encourag'd <HI>Oliver</HI> to lay hands upon the Per&s;on of the King: in hopes at that time to bring down the Power of that Formidable Monar|chy by Sea, as is ea&s;ie to judge by the Entertain|ment which the Court of <HI>France</HI> gave to the Princes of the Royal Family of <HI>England</HI> in that Conjuncture.</P>
<P>Moreover after what a Treacherous manner did <HI>France</HI> act with the Old Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> might have an Advantage to u&s;urp his Country. For Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> under pretence of Friend&s;hip drew him to <HI>Lion,</HI> where <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII then lay with
<PB N="8" REF="6"> a Powerful Army, under a fal&s;e pretence, that it believ'd him to come and pay his Re&s;pects to that Monarch. Thither the Prince, &s;u&s;pecting nothing but hone&s;t and fair dealing, repair'd, and was re|ceiv'd at fir&s;t with Extraordinary Honour and Ci|vility, not only by the King and the Cardinal, but by all the Grandees of the Court, who were or|der'd to treat him Splendidly. But that was but the Bait to draw him on: for when the poor Duke, laden with the Honours of the Court, and &s;atisfi'd with his Kind Reception, was about to return home, he was &s;topp'd by the Cardinal's Order; nor could he procure his Relea&s;e, but by delivering back into the hands of <HI>France</HI> a great part of his Territories, which afterwards occa&s;ion'd the lo&s;s of all the re&s;t, under pretence that the Prince was an active &s;tirring Soldier, and devoted to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> But indeed, becau&s;e the Policy of the Court of <HI>France</HI> could not brook &s;o near her a So|veraign Prince, who&s;e Territories were a Goad in her &s;ides, and might &s;erve for an Inlet into <HI>France</HI> out of <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Now in regard it is the Policy of a Mini&s;ter of State, to the end he may be lamented and de&s;ir'd after his Death, to ju&s;tifie his Conduct in the Eyes of the People, <HI>Richlieu</HI> was willing to have for his Succe&s;&s;our a Mini&s;ter that &s;hould out do him, and fini&s;h what he had begun: therefore he recommen|ded Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> by Birth, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ean Extraction, naturally covetous, and deceitful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> whatever he undertook, covering him&s;elf with the Foxes Skin, the better to deceive others and play his own part, not caring for whatever People &s;aid of him, nor what Mi&s;chief was laid to his
<PB N="9" REF="6"> charge, &s;o he could bring about his Grand De&s;ign, which was to get Money; &s;o that all the whole time of his Mini&s;try he was call'd <HI>The Hor&s;leech of the People.</HI> By good luck, he came to his Mini&s;try during the Regency of a Credulous Queen and a Young King, whom he Chri&s;ten'd, that he might acquire to him&s;elf the more Re&s;pect and Venera|tion. It was ea&s;ie for him both to imprint in the mind of this Young Prince, and in&s;till into him Precepts according to his own Humour, which were to Sacrifice every thing to his own Intere&s;t; Ho|nour, Word, Alliances, Edicts, Promi&s;es, Oaths, when all the&s;e Vertues were oppo&s;ite to his Aggran|dizement: That it behov'd a Prince that would be great, to accommodate him&s;elf to the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs: that it was &s;ufficient for a Prince to be Vertuous, when he could not di&s;pence with being otherwi&s;e: that it was good and commendable to know what was ju&s;t and hone&s;t, but not always ex|pedient to practi&s;e it. That there were &s;ome Vices which no way hinder'd a Prince from Governing well: that <HI>Solomon</HI> was &s;ubject to Women, yet look'd upon to be the Greate&s;t and Wi&s;e&s;t of all Kings: for that there is always a Di&s;tinction to be made between the Dome&s;tick and Publick Life of a Prince, his Royal and his Private Vertues. Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> having thus found out the Geni|us of his Di&s;ciple, 'twas an ea&s;ie thing for him to imprint in his Mind the&s;e New Lectures of Po|licy, which afterwards &s;erv'd for a Ba&s;is and Foun|dation to the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who toget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> with the Queen-Mother, out of pure Gratitude de|liver'd into the Cardinal's hands the Keys of all the Favours and Honours of his Kingdom, upheld him
<PB N="10" REF="7"> in de&s;pite of all the Princes of the Blood, and not|with&s;tanding all the earne&s;t Importunities of the Parliament and People, underwent all the Dangers of a Civil War for &s;ome Years; and not being able to live without the Cardinal's Pre&s;ence, the King &s;ent for him twice out of Bani&s;hment, and receiv'd him with tho&s;e Honours that were no way due to him, even to the going &s;everal Leagues to meet him, and to expre&s;s his exce&s;&s;ive Joy for his Return by mutual Embraces. I &s;hall not here enlarge upon the Authority and Power which that Italian Cardinal had in <HI>France;</HI> 'tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, That the King, during his Minority, had all the Deference and Re|&s;pect for that Prelate which a Son could have for a Father, and that it was the Cardinal who only reign'd in <HI>France.</HI> In lieu of which, he promis'd the King and Queen, That he would make him the Greate&s;t Monarch in <HI>Europe&punc;</HI> In order whereunto, he was to do&punc; Two things. The Fir&s;t, was, To heap up Trea&s;ure, and augment his Revenues. The Se|cond, was, To lay a&s;ide all Scruples of Con|&s;cience, when the main Concern was, the Aggran|dizing his Kingdoms.

Immediately after his Promotion, he went to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Principality of <HI>Sedan,</HI> which the two Cardinals had wre&s;ted from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bouillon</HI> by Violence; fora&s;much as that Principality border'd too near upon <HI>France,</HI> and al&s;o dur&s;t make Head again&s;t it, but at a time when <HI>France</HI> was not &s;o powerful as now it is. 'Tis true, that the Duke of <HI>Bouillon, Frederick Maurice,</HI> who was then Sovereign of the Place, had very much contributed to the lo&s;s of it, by changing his Religion, upon his marrying the Counte&s;s of <HI>Berghe.</HI> For being at that time Governor of <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> and in the Service of the States of the United Provinces, who&s;e Protection warranted his Territories from all A&s;&s;aults of <HI>France;</HI> yet finding him&s;elf no longer acceptable to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> his near Kin&s;man, nor to the States them|&s;elves, he de&s;ir'd leave to lay down his Commi&s;&s;ion and retire to <HI>Sedan,</HI> there to lead a private and quiet Life, and wholly to employ him&s;elf within his Prin|cipality to the Propagation of the Roman Religion, which he had embrac'd; in which Employment he made &s;ome Progre&s;s during &s;ome Years. After which, he met with Bu&s;ine&s;s much more con&s;ide|rable&punc; by rea&s;on of the Refuge which he gave to the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> one of the Princes of the Blood, and who was retir'd in di&s;content from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> by rea&s;on of &s;ome Quarrel with Cardinal <HI>Richlieu;</HI> and this Count was follow'd by the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e.</HI> Now the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI> thought to have avoided all Occa&s;ion of Trouble, by giving notice to the Court of <HI>France</HI> of the Retreat of tho&s;e two Princes: but the Cardinal, a &s;ubtle and crafty
<PB N="13" REF="8"> Politician, &s;eeing he could not hinder it, per&s;uaded the King to approve what he had done, till an Op|portunity of Revenge pre&s;ented it &s;elf, as it appear'd not long after by the King's taking the Field, in order to be&s;iege the City of <HI>Sedan.</HI> Nor had the Duke, at that time, any other way to pre&s;erve him|&s;elf, but by clapping up a League in all ha&s;te with the Emperor and <HI>Spain,</HI> by which they were to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t <HI>France</HI> with Seven thou&s;and Men, and Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns in Ready-Money. But the Emperor only perform'd his Pro|mi&s;e, and &s;ent him &s;ome Forces under the Conduct of General <HI>d'Amboi.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, the Germans, together with about Four thou&s;and Men which the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI> had rais'd at his Charges, de|feated the French Army under the Command of <HI>Chatillon;</HI> the Fruit of which Victory was, the Taking of <HI>Doncheri,</HI> not far from <HI>Sedan.</HI> And this lucky Beginning of the Duke made the Court of <HI>France</HI> begin to look about 'em, as being afraid le&s;t that petty War &s;hould kindle a greater. Thereupon the Duke of <HI>Brez&eacute;</HI> was &s;ent the &s;ame way with Five and twenty thou&s;and Men; and the Cardinal per&s;uaded the King, and all the Court, to march as far as <HI>Rethel.</HI> But unfortunately for the Duke of <HI>Bouillon, Lamboy</HI> quitted him, with all his Men, being order'd to march to the Relief of <HI>Aire,</HI> which the French had be&s;ieg'd. So that the Duke finding him&s;elf con&s;train'd to &s;hut him&s;elf up within the Walls of <HI>Sedan,</HI> and &s;eeing him&s;elf be&s;ieg'd, began to think of an Accommoda|tion, &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e the Count of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> who had been the Occa&s;ion of the War, had &s;hot him&s;elf in the Head with a Pi&s;tol Bullet. This was no more then what <HI>France</HI> de&s;ir'd, as having
<PB N="14" REF="9"> at that time a War with <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;everal di&s;contented Princes and Lords within the Kingdom, who waited only for an Opportunity to ri&s;e, and the Siege of <HI>Aire</HI> begun; uncertain therefore of Succe&s;s, and having &s;o many Irons in the Fire, &s;he dur&s;t not ven|ture the be&s;ieging of <HI>Sedan,</HI> which they were con|vinc'd that the Duke would defend with the la&s;t drop of his Blood; be&s;ides that he had Great Men that took his Part at Court, as not being willing that Place &s;hould fall into the King's Hands, which, upon many Occa&s;ions, &s;erv'd 'em for a Retiring Place. Wherefore being al&s;o no le&s;s de&s;irous to &s;pite Car|dinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who was look'd upon as the fir&s;t Au|thor of that War, they per&s;uaded the King, who was advanc'd as far as <HI>Meziere,</HI> to hearken to an Ac|commodation. Thereupon the Cardinal &s;eeing it was not to be avoided, offer'd his Mediation to the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> to the end that the Affair pa&s;&s;ing through his Hands, the Duke might think him&s;elf beholding to him for this Kindne&s;s, though his De|&s;ign were to ruine the Duke &s;ome other way. To which purpo&s;e, he made great Prote&s;tations to the Duke, who took all for Gold that gli&s;ter'd; and being but a new Catholick, believ'd that what|ever that &s;ame Prelate and Prince of the Church a&s;&s;ur'd him, was &s;incere, and truly hone&s;t. But whatever Prote&s;tation his Eminency made, he had always a Re&s;erve which he kept clo&s;e in his Brea&s;t: and the better to cover his De&s;ign, and &s;hew his Good-Will, he would needs enter into a Treaty, as a Security for the Duke's Sincerity; and a Gauranty on the King's behalf, That His Maje&s;ty would per|form the Agreement to the lea&s;t Tittle of the Stipu|lation, the better to lull the Duke a&s;leep, and draw
<PB N="15" REF="9"> him to the Court. Thereupon the Articles being &s;ign'd on both Sides, the Duke went forthwith to pay his Re&s;pects to the King at <HI>Meziere,</HI> where he was entertain'd with Court-Holy-Water, fair Words and Complements, and receiv'd by the King, the Car|dinal, and all the Lords, with all the Honours ima|ginable due to his Dignity. The Cardinal al&s;o gave him large Demon&s;trations of Friend&s;hip, and made him extraordinary Promi&s;es, on purpo&s;e to engage him to have a Confidence in him, and make him believe that he had forgot the injurious <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> which the Duke had printed again&s;t him. Yet all this was nothing el&s;e but Snare and Decoy. For his Eminency told the King, in the pre&s;ence of all the Court, That he could not do better then to entru&s;t an Army under the Command of the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> as one that &s;o well de&s;erv'd the Honour, &s;eeing that with a handful of wretched Germans he had beaten the Army of <HI>France;</HI> &s;o that there was nothing which he might not well expect from his Valour and Ex|perience, when he &s;hould once come to Head the Valour of the French. This the Duke took in good earne&s;t, and &s;o fell into the Snare; and though he had been forewarn'd by the Cardinal's Enemies, that the more Affection and Kindne&s;s that Mini&s;ter &s;hew'd, the le&s;s he was to be tru&s;ted; yet he was &s;o ea&s;ily wrought upon, as to accept the Command of an Army in <HI>Italy;</HI> and that was the very Place where the Cardinal was de&s;irous to keep him. For being in that Po&s;t, he forgot him&s;elf to that degree, as during the Sickne&s;s of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. to give the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> a Letter of Credence to be admitted into <HI>Sedan,</HI> together with the Queen-Mother, and the Children of <HI>France,</HI> under pretence of retiring
<PB N="16" REF="10"> thither after the King's Death, to avoid the Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Cardinal, tho' the Count of <HI>d'Au|bijoux,</HI> who went to him in <HI>Italy,</HI> promis'd him with great Oaths and Imprecations, that he would never deliver the Letter, unle&s;s there &s;hould be an Ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity. But the King e&s;cap'd that Sickne&s;s, and the Cardinal having notice of every thing to the &s;malle&s;t Circum&s;tance, gave him an account of every particular, and thought it a favourable Oppor|tunity to revenge him&s;elf for what was pa&s;t, and to put the Principality of <HI>Sedan</HI> into the Hands of <HI>France</HI> without the Effu&s;ion of Blood. For he &s;eldom &s;e|parated the Remembrance of an Injury and the de|&s;ire of Revenge. It happen'd at the &s;ame time that the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> finding his Brother very Infirm and &s;ickly, and believing that during the Minority of the Young King, when the Cardinal would have all the Power in his hands, he &s;hould lead but an ill life in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;eeing him&s;elf ex|pos'd to the Re&s;entment of his Adver&s;ary, he be|thought him&s;elf of making a League with the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> by the mediation of a Gentleman, who&s;e Name was <HI>Fourraille,</HI> whom he &s;ent to <HI>Madrid.</HI> But the Cardinal having got an Inkling of it, &s;ent his Secretary <HI>Chavigni,</HI> privately to give the King no|tice of it, and in the mean time he left no Stone unturn'd to di&s;cover the Contents of the Treaty that had been concluded at <HI>Madrid;</HI> and he &s;et &s;o many Engines at work, that he found a way to get a Copy of it from &s;ome Secretary to the Duke of <HI>Orleance.</HI> So &s;oon as he had read it, he &s;ent it to the King by the &s;ame <HI>Chavigni,</HI> and order'd him to a&s;&s;ure his Maje&s;ty that the Copy was drawn from the Original it &s;elf; and for this &s;ame Piece it was that
<PB N="17" REF="10"> <HI>Cinqmarc</HI> and <HI>du Thou</HI> were apprehended, and that the King order'd his Brother the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> to be very narrowly watch'd, who finding it Im|po&s;&s;ible for him to make his E&s;cape out of <HI>France,</HI> took a Re&s;olution to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the King's Mercy, and implore his Pardon; and wrote a very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Letter to the Cardinal, which he &s;ent him by one of his Favourites; wherein he &s;et forth his Repentance in very moving Expre&s;&s;ions, and his de&s;ire to be beholding for the Favour of his Reconciliation with the King to his Eminency, who willingly embrac'd the Opportunity of gaining the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI>'s Friend&s;hip, and of having at his Beck an In&s;trument to ruine the Duke of <HI>Bouillon.</HI> Thereupon he made the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI>'s Peace with the King, upon Condition that he &s;hould de|liver into his hands the Original of the Treaty. But the King's Brother prote&s;ted that he had burn'd the Original, and had only kept a Copy &s;ign'd with his own Hand, and Counter-&s;ign'd by the Secretary of his Commands; by vertue of which Copy both <HI>Cinqmarc</HI> and <HI>de Thou</HI> were both arraign'd, and the Fatal End they came to is well known. But to re|turn to the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> you are to under&s;tand that <HI>Fontraille,</HI> who was &s;ent into <HI>Spain</HI> to conclude the Treaty, that he might bring it the &s;ooner to pa&s;s, and imprint a higher Opinion of the Bu&s;ine&s;s in the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> would needs in&s;ert the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI>'s Name in the Treaty without his Know|ledge; and promis'd that he &s;hould not only ratifie it, but allow <HI>Sedan</HI> for a Place of Refuge; tho' the Duke never ratify'd the Treaty, nor ever caus'd his Name to be in&s;erted; but quite the contrary had always oppos'd it, when the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="11"> had formerly made &s;ome Overtures to him of the &s;ame nature. However there needed no more to ruine him; &s;o that the Cardinal di&s;patch'd away a Cour|rier forthwith into <HI>Italy,</HI> with Orders for &s;eizing his Per&s;on, which was done at <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> by the General Offi|cers, who commanded under him, from whence he was conducted by a numerous Convoy to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Pierre-en-Cize.</HI> And there it was that the Duke fir&s;t under&s;tood, That he had been compre|hended in the Treaty of <HI>Madrid,</HI> of which the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> had given him a Copy &s;ign'd with his own Hand; and that he at the &s;ame time had di&s;cover'd the Queen's and the Duke's De&s;ign to retire to <HI>Sedan,</HI> upon the King's Decea&s;e. The crafty Cardinal ob&s;erv'd by this Confe&s;&s;ion how much he was fear'd and dreaded, which &s;erv'd to render him more ab&s;olute then ever, and impower'd him to revenge him&s;elf of his Enemies more loftily and more in|exorably. For whatever Excu&s;e the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI> could make, and tho' it could never be prov'd that he ever &s;ign'd or ratify'd the Treaty, or gave any order for the in&s;erting of his Name there|in, there was no other Choice for him to make, but either to lo&s;e his Head or his Principality of <HI>Sedan.</HI> Which was no more then what <HI>France</HI> had &s;ought a long time, and for the bringing of which to pa&s;s, there was no foul Play which the Mini&s;ter had not put in Practi&s;e, no Snare that he had not laid to entrap the Innocent. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> ha|ving notice of her Husband's Impri&s;onment, and of the danger he was in of his Life, &s;ent her Si&s;ter in Law to Court, to let the Cardinal know, that if the Duke were put to death, &s;he would deliver <HI>Sedan</HI> to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to which purpo&s;e &s;he had already
<PB N="19" REF="11"> &s;ent to <HI>Bru&s;&s;ells</HI> to &s;ollicit their Approach to the Town. But Mademoi&s;elle <HI>de Bouillon,</HI> arriving at the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and under&s;tanding that <HI>du Thou</HI> had been condemn'd for only being privy to, and concealing <HI>Cinqmarc</HI>'s De&s;ign, chang'd her note, and was &s;o far from delivering the Dutche&s;&s;es Me|naces to the Cardinal, according to her In&s;tructi|ons, that &s;he told the Cardinal &s;he had Orders to enter into a Negotiation, and to engage for the Life and Liberty of her Brother. This was that which the Cardinal expected, and therefore with|out giving her any time to recollect her &s;elf, the Treaty was concluded, That the Dutche&s;s &s;hould de|liver <HI>Sedan</HI> to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and that the Duke her Husband &s;hould be put into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of other Lands of equal value in the Kingdom; and that at the &s;ame time that the French Garri&s;on &s;hould enter the Town, the Pri&s;oner &s;hould be releas'd. Thereupon, Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> not being able to go him&s;elf, &s;ent his Coadjutour in the Mi|ni&s;try, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and &s;ecur'd it to all Intents and Purpo&s;es. Thus that Important City which had with&s;tood the King, fell into his Hands, partly through the ill Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> but chiefly through the Snares which the Policy of <HI>France</HI> laid for him, ever &s;ince he quitted his Religion and the Service of the States. For in good Policy they ought to have pre&s;erv'd that City which gave Protection to the Prote&s;tant Party.</P>
<P>The Death of the Cardinal happening in one and the &s;ame year, the Queen being declar'd Re|gent, and Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> Chief of the Council, the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI> returrn'd to Court, flattering him&s;elf with being re&s;tor'd to his Dominions, con&s;i|dering
<PB N="20" REF="12"> that his Misfortune did not befall him, but for the good Services which he was ready to have done tho&s;e Two Illu&s;trious Per&s;ons, that now &s;ate at the Helm of State, and who had engag'd him without his Knowledge. But when he came to Court, he only found a change of the Regency, but not of the Mini&s;try, which was &s;till cunning and wilely: For <HI>Mazarine,</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Richlieu</HI> in the Government, out-did his Predece&s;&s;or. He found that the Di&s;ciple knew more then the Ma&s;ter; that he had a double portion of Avarice and Self-Intere&s;t; that Italian Knavery had &s;ucceeded French Refinedne&s;s, and that he had no mind to let go the Prey which he already held fa&s;t in his Gripes, and for which he had labour'd conjoyntly with his Predece&s;&s;our. 'Tis true, that when the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI> fir&s;t ar|riv'd, he receiv'd a world of Complements from the Queen, the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and all the Court; but when he came to talk of Bu&s;ine&s;s, all that Court|&s;hip vani&s;h'd, nor could he obtain &s;o much as Audience either of the Queen or the Duke of <HI>Or|leance,</HI> till at length by dint of Pre&s;&s;ing Importunity he got &s;o much favour, that the Abbot <HI>de la Riviere,</HI> a Favourite of <HI>Orleance</HI>'s was appointed to conferr with him about his Preten&s;ions; and that meerly to be ridd of him: <HI>Bouillon</HI> therefore &s;eeing he could do no better, fell upon the Matter with the Abbot, and told him, That he was willing to fulfill the Treaty made with <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII, but that the Evacu|ation, the Verification in Parliament, and &s;o ma|ny other Formalities ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, would infallibly take up a tedious Space of &s;everal Years: therefore till all tho&s;e Ceremonies were at an end, that 'twas but ju&s;t that <HI>Sedan</HI> &s;hould be re&s;tor'd him
<PB N="21" REF="12"> to be &s;urrender'd back into the King's Hands, &s;o &s;oon as he &s;hould be put into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Equi|valents: that con&s;idering the Pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs, he fore&s;aw long Delays and infinite Cavils; whereas if <HI>Sedan</HI> were in his Hands, it would be look'd upon as the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s, no le&s;s then the Enlarging of <HI>France</HI> by the Acqui&s;ition of a Sove|raignty, and a City of great Strength and Impor|tance. That if the&s;e Rea&s;ons would not work up|on the Queen nor Mon&s;ieur, he de&s;ir'd the Abbot to lay before 'em, that the One or the Other might happen to dye before Things could be brought to that perfection, as to be fit to be put in Execution, which would inevitably prove the Ruine of his Fa|mily; and that they were engag'd as well in Ho|nour as in Con&s;cience not to expo&s;e him to that Extremity. To this he added, That tho' the Queen and the Duke had the lea&s;t rea&s;on in the world to di&s;tru&s;t his Words, neverthele&s;s he offer'd to give his Children in Ho&s;tage, or to &s;ubmit to whatever Precautions they de&s;ir'd to take, for the Security of the Young King. But this was like knocking at a deaf Man's door; for the Abbot, who had his In&s;tructions, told him with a great many Complements, That he had only Orders to hear him; but that he would make a faithful Report of what he had &s;aid; adding with great Prote&s;tations, That it &s;hould be none of his Fault that he had not a favourable An&s;wer: but that was a thing which was never intended. So that <HI>Bouillon</HI> finding that the Abbot never came at him more, re&s;olv'd to ad|dre&s;s him&s;elf directly to the Queen and the Duke of <HI>Orleance:</HI> but both the One and the Other knew &s;o well how to avoid meeting him, that he could
<PB N="22" REF="13"> never find an Opportunity to &s;peak to 'em. Which put him into a Rage, and caus'd him to let fall &s;ome hard words again&s;t the Queen and the Duke, as being too forgetful of what he had done for 'em. However <HI>Bouillon,</HI> unwilling to return Home with|out a po&s;itive An&s;wer, apply'd him&s;elf again to the Abbot: but then he could never find the Abbot at home, his Servants having Orders &s;till to deny him whenever <HI>Bouillon</HI> came to ask for him. Nay, it happen'd one day, that tho' he knew that the Ab|bot was at home, by certain Per&s;ons of Quality that waited in his Antichamber to &s;peak with him, yet the Abbot was &s;o unmannerly as to &s;end out one of his Servants to tell him bluntly in the hearing of tho&s;e Gentlemen, That the Abbot was gone abroad; which put the Duke of <HI>Bouillon</HI> into &s;uch a Rage, that he bid the Servant tell his Ma&s;ter, That had it not been for the Re&s;pect which he bore the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> he would have return'd him &s;uch a Treatment for his Sawcine&s;s, that &s;hould have &s;tuck to him as long as he liv'd.</P>
<P>This Tran&s;port of Pa&s;&s;ion in the Duke made a great noi&s;e at Court, &s;o that the Queen, and the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> were glad of this pretence to ridd them|&s;elves of a Per&s;on who&s;e pre&s;ence continually Re|proach'd 'em with his pa&s;t Services, and the Car|dinal propos'd in Council a &s;econd &s;eizure of his Per&s;on. But <HI>Bouillon</HI> having notice of it underhand, took Po&s;t for <HI>Turenne,</HI> there to &s;pend the Remain|der of his days, having lo&s;t not only the Impor|tant City of <HI>Sedan,</HI> but the promis'd Equivalent be&s;ides. Nor does the Court of <HI>France</HI> do any thing more for the Family of <HI>Bouillon,</HI> then only lull 'em a&s;leep with Cardinals Caps and Benefices of

<P>I would fain have the French Emi&s;&s;aries tell me what rea&s;on the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King had to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Principality of <HI>Orange,</HI> to beat down the Fortifications of the Ca&s;tle in the year 1667, when the Sovereign was under Age, and afterwards utterly to demoli&s;h the Ca&s;tle and Walls of the City, and not content with that &s;ame De|&s;olation, to &s;ollicite the Corporations to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the King, threatning, if they refus'd, to burn and totally ruine the Inhabitants, as after|wards the French Forces did, notwith&s;tanding their Independant Sovereignty. I am per&s;waded the be&s;t rea&s;on tho&s;e Emi&s;&s;aries can give, is becau&s;e the Po|licy of <HI>France</HI> cannot brook a Foreign Sovereignty within her Dominions: and &s;o it was the Intere&s;t of the Court to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of it, be|fore the Sovereign was in a Condition to with&s;tand their Power, by means of his Friends and Confede|rates: and all the while they pretended that they had done the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> a &s;ignal Piece of Service, becau&s;e they had &s;par'd him the Expence of a Gar|ri&s;on. But if &s;uch be the Charity of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, what may we expect from his Se|verity?</P>
<P>Without Que&s;tion the &s;ame Spirit it was that in|&s;pir'd <HI>France</HI> to &s;eize upon <HI>Burgundy</HI> and <HI>Franche Cont&eacute;,</HI> without any pretence of Claim, after the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, and without any other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e <HI>Spain</HI> being weak, was not able to defend her &s;elf, and becau&s;e it is really the Court of <HI>France</HI> to aggrandize her &s;elf &s;o &s;oon as &s;he finds an Oppor|tunity, without any re&s;pect to Treaties or Alliances.
<PB N="24" REF="14"> And it may be &s;aid, that the Mini&s;try of <HI>Maza|rine</HI> was a continu'd Chain of Oppre&s;&s;ions, and that he made it his Study all his Life-time to extingui&s;h the Nobility of <HI>France</HI> by all the ways imaginable, whether right or wrong: tho' he were cunning e|nough to &s;upport 'em during the Troubles which happen'd in the Kingdom during the reigning King's Minority.</P>

But in regard he had no rea&s;on to be &s;atisfy'd with the People, he was the Inventor of the greate&s;t part of the Taxes now raging in <HI>France,</HI> the Father of the Publicans and Toll-gatherers. He &s;uck'd the Blood of the Subjects, in imitation of the Grand Signior, for the Support of the Soldiery, preferr'd before the People, at the Expence of the People, and tho' it &s;hould be to their utter Ruin; to

And in pur&s;uance of that Maxim we have &s;een, that during this Reign, the Court of <HI>France</HI> has practis'd this Le&s;&s;on, which has ruin'd her People, that &s;he has impoveri&s;h'd her Subjects, depriv'd the Nobility of their Privileges, and all this meerly by keeping great Armies on foot, to &s;erve her at all times with both Hands to ruin the People, when ever they went about to &s;hake off or complain of the Exce&s;&s;ive Taxes and Impo&s;ts with which they are daily overwhelm'd: to cha&s;tize the Parliaments when they refus'd to verifie the Edicts and Impo&s;itions which the Kings &s;ends to 'em: as al&s;o that &s;he may have her Legions al|ways ready to invade the Dominions of her Neigh|bours, when they lea&s;t dream of any &s;uch Acts of Ho&s;tility; or are otherwi&s;e employ'd, relying up|on the Faith of Treaties. As we have &s;een how that after the Peace of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> when <HI>France</HI> finding her Trea&s;ures quite exhau&s;ted, and her numerous Ar|mies ruin'd by Sickne&s;s &amp; Hard&s;hips, was con&s;train'd to make fre&s;h Provi&s;ion, fearing a Change of Fortune, as &s;he had already felt at the Battel of St. <HI>Dennis.</HI> For this rea&s;on &s;he &s;ought Peace to break the Union, and obtain'd it in de&s;pite of tho&s;e who well fore|&s;aw that <HI>France</HI> would no longer keep it after &s;he had once recover'd Breath, or that &s;he found a Pro|pitious Opportunity to break it. For &s;ince the King of <HI>France</HI> fal&s;ify'd his Oath to ob&s;erve the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Peace, &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn upon the Altar, Since|rity
<PB N="26" REF="15"> is fled from the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and return'd to Heaven, from whence it de&s;cended, and Corruption has taken the Place of Ju&s;tice and Integrity. In regard the Mini&s;try of <HI>France</HI> was only meditated to aggrandize the King. And therefore the de|cea&s;ed Sieur <HI>de Colbert,</HI> Chief Mini&s;ter, never &s;crupled to a&s;&s;ert, That the King might break and make Laws at his own plea&s;ure; Privileges being Chimera's odious and offen&s;ive to it, and that Law was only the Inclination, Reputation and Autho|rity of the Prince.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>France</HI> has a mind to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of a Country, or only of a &s;ingle Town, he never con&s;iders the Outward Situation, but the Inward Condition of it; by whom it is go|vern'd, who defends it; and the Louidores are mo&s;t commonly the Cannons with which he attacks it. And therefore <HI>Pompone,</HI> formerly Emba&s;&s;adour at the Court of <HI>Sweden,</HI> had in &s;ome mea&s;ure good Rea&s;on to &s;ay, that <HI>France</HI> with her Money would always do what &s;he pleas'd; and that it was by means of that Metal, that &s;he was at that time become Mi&s;tre&s;s of his <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty's Cabinet, and that &s;he became Mi&s;tre&s;s of &s;o many Places after the Peace of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> under pretence of Appendences and Dependences, of which a great Volume might be made. This is a Truth not to be deny'd, &s;ince we have &s;een it with our Eyes, and that we &s;till be|hold the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Places groaning un|der the &s;evere Servitude of the De&s;potick Govern|ment of <HI>France.</HI> But in regard that U&s;urpation cannot always long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and for that &s;o many Princes are at la&s;t awaken'd from their Oppre&s;&s;ion, the Court of <HI>France</HI> finding her &s;elf very much embar|ra&s;s'd
<PB N="27" REF="15"> to pre&s;erve what &s;he has u&s;urp'd &s;ince the Peace of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> all her Policy could find out no better Expedient then to propo&s;e a Truce while the Emperour and the Empire were engag'd in a War again&s;t the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>The Court of <HI>France</HI> had two Pro&s;pects in de|&s;iring this Truce. The fir&s;t, That in detaining all the Places of which &s;he had made her &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he at the &s;ame time lull'd a&s;leep the Court of <HI>Vienna</HI> on the <HI>Rhine</HI> &s;ide, that &s;he might oblige the Empe|rour to continue the War with the Grand Signior. Secondly, Not to ob&s;erve the Truce any longer then till one or other of the Two Empires were reduc'd to a Low Condition. Had it been the Em|perour's misfortune to have lo&s;t <HI>Vienna,</HI> then the Bu|&s;ine&s;s was concerted and decreed, That the King of <HI>France</HI> was to have invaded the Empire with a powerful Army, and to have been proclaim'd Em|perour with a high hand. On the Other &s;ide, if the <HI>Turks</HI> were beaten, he was to declare War again&s;t the Emperour, to prevent him from growing too great by his Conque&s;ts. But the latter falling out for the good of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> pre&s;ently <HI>France</HI> without any regard had to Truces or Alliances, openly attacqu'd <HI>Philipsburgh,</HI> carry'd it, and af|terwards march'd with his Army into the <HI>Palatinate</HI> which he over-ran with Fire and Sword, and by Violence, and Conflagrations, got &s;ure footing all along the Banks of the <HI>Rhine&punc;</HI> where we to this day behold the &s;ad and deplorable Remainders of the Rage and Fury of the <HI>French</HI> Armies. However in regard that Violence never wants a Pretence, and that the mo&s;t Impious Actions veil them&s;elves in like manner with &s;ome Outward Appearances;
<PB N="28" REF="16"> the King of <HI>France</HI> to ju&s;tifie him&s;elf before all the World, out of a kind of Genero&s;ity pretends to declare the Rea&s;ons why he was con&s;train'd to re|&s;ume Ho&s;tile Arms, to the end he might per&s;wade all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> of his &s;incere Intentions to e&s;tabli&s;h the publick Repo&s;e, while his Soldiers in all Places ruin'd and burnt whole Provinces, and carry'd away the Goods and Cattel of the Poor Inhabi|tants.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King fol|lows his begun Ho&s;tilities with a <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> where|in the Principal Rea&s;ons that <HI>France</HI> alledges to co|ver her Breach of Faith, are fir&s;t, That &s;he was well inform'd that &s;o &s;oon as the Emperour &s;hould have made a Peace with the <HI>Turk,</HI> he had re&s;olv'd to bend all his whole Force upon the <HI>Rhine</HI> again&s;t <HI>France.</HI> To which I &s;hall an&s;wer hereafter in Par|ticular: but in general thus much is to be &s;aid, that the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, after he had broken the Truce, de&s;ir'd to make a Peace upon two Conditions. Fir&s;t, That the Truce for Twenty Years might be chang'd into a Perpetual Peace: and Secondly, That the Cardinal <HI>de Fur&s;tenbergh</HI> might be put into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Electorate of <HI>Cologne;</HI> and that afterwards the King would en|deavour to bring the Cardinal and the Chapter to &s;uch Accommodations as &s;hould be propos'd for the Satisfaction of Prince <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> that is to &s;ay, to cau&s;e him to be declar'd Coadjutour to the &s;aid Electorate.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point the Politicks of the Court of <HI>France</HI> were very fine Spun and extreamly Crafty; &s;eeing that while the Emperour and the Empire were engag'd again&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> it was the proper
<PB N="29" REF="16"> time for her to appropriate to her &s;elf all the Places, Lands and Signiories which by the Truce were not left to the enjoyment of <HI>France</HI> but for Twenty years, of which three were expir'd, and which the King was fully per&s;waded in his Con&s;cience that he could not ju&s;tly keep, but mu&s;t be forc'd to re&s;tore at the Expiration of the Truce.</P>
<P>As for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Cologne</HI> by the Cardinal of <HI>Fur&s;tenbergh,</HI> (the detaining of which from the &s;aid Cardinal was another &s;pecious Pretence for his re|&s;uming Arms) all <HI>Europe</HI> is &s;ufficiently acquainted with the Engaging Rea&s;on which the Mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian King had to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that Arch|bi&s;hoprick: &s;eeing the Cardinal and the King were all one, and &s;o by means of that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, the King of <HI>France</HI> had one Foot in the Empire, and upon the Territories adjoyning, belonging either to the States of the United Provinces, or the <HI>Palatine</HI> and <HI>Brandenburgh</HI> Electors. But becau&s;e it will be a difficult matter for us to treat otherwi&s;e then con|fu&s;edly of the Policy of <HI>France</HI> in general, we &s;hall de&s;cend to Particulars, thereby to render it more Intelligible, beginning with the Holy See.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>France</HI> have always held them&s;elves highly honour'd with the Title of Elde&s;t Sons of the Church, and would have made War upon any one that &s;hould have ventur'd to di&s;pute that Title with 'em. In like manner, they have all along given Marks of their Filial Obedience, and a de|vout &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to what ever came from the Holy See. And to have &s;een <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. per&s;ecute the <HI>Huguenots</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> there is no body but would have &s;worn that he had been the mo&s;t Zealous Ca|tholick in the world. Neverthele&s;s we have &s;een
<PB N="31" REF="17"> the contrary, and that what he has done in refe|rence to the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> was only to ward off the Accu&s;ations that might have been charg'd upon him for openly oppo&s;ing the Holy See, while he affronted, as all the world knows he openly did, Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. only becau&s;e the Holy Father would not give way to his U&s;urpation of the Regale in <HI>France;</HI> which produc'd the A&s;&s;embly of &s;ome Prelates of the <HI>French</HI> Clergy in the Year 1682. wherein the Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris</HI> who pre&s;ided there, being flatter'd in ca&s;e of a Rupture, with the hopes of being Pa|triarch of the Kingdom, or in ca&s;e of an Accommo|dation, with the expectation of a Cardinals Cap, got all the Prelates who were pre&s;ent at the A&s;&s;em|bly, to degrade the Papal Authority, and of a Uni|ver&s;al Pontiff, to make him a Simple Bi&s;hop, &s;ub|jected to Councils. And the King con&s;train'd all the Preachers in the Kingdom, and Rectors of U|niver&s;ities to declaim and teach a Doctrine in Op|po&s;ition to the Authority of the Pontiff Nay, the Bu&s;ine&s;s went &s;o high, that the Court of <HI>France</HI> un|dertook to govern <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, in oppo&s;ing the Sup|pre&s;&s;ion of the Franchi&s;es of Emba&s;&s;adours Quar|ters in <HI>Rome;</HI> which indeed were no more then a Sanctuary for Robbers and Bankrupts. More|over, the King of <HI>France,</HI> that he might remain peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;our of the Regale, went about to &s;et a foot an Old Preten&s;ion of the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> to the States of <HI>Ca&s;tro,</HI> and <HI>Ronciglione,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing 'em Guarranties only of the Treaty of <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> which was a Pretence to &s;eize upon the City and Country of <HI>Avignon,</HI> which the Court of <HI>France</HI> had for a long time look'd upon as an E&s;tate that lay convenient for her, and only &s;ought an Opportunity to detain
<PB N="30" REF="17"> it, without being oblig'd to make Re&s;titution; and which had taken effect, had not <HI>Innocent</HI> the XI. been a quiet and peaceable Pontiff, &s;uffering with a Chri&s;tian Patience while he liv'd, all the Affronts of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> referring the Revenge of 'em, as he was often wont to &s;ay, to his <HI>Crucify'd Saviour;</HI> and to him it was, that the Holy Father appeal'd, when <HI>France</HI> &s;ent him a Copy of the Extract of the Regi&s;ters of the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the en&s;uing Words.</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>This day the King's Advocate-General coming into the <HI>Chamber of Vacations,</HI> and declaring, That the Matters of Fact explain'd by the Letter which the King wrote to Cardinal <HI>d'E&s;trees</HI> the 6th. of this Month, having oblig'd his Maje&s;ty to let our Ho|ly Father the Pope know, That for the future he could not but look upon him as a Prince engag'd with his Enemies, con&s;equently that he could not acknowledge him for a Judge of every thing that concern'd his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;ts, the King's Ad|vocate General thought it his Duty, at the &s;ame time to take the Precautions &s;ettl'd by the Law, practis'd upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions, and grounded upon the Opinions of the <HI>Italian</HI> Canoni&s;ts them|&s;elves, to hinder his Holine&s;s from pronouncing Effectual and Regular Judgments upon the&s;e Mat|ters. To which purpo&s;e, he has put in to a Uni|ver&s;al Council an Appeal Extrajudicial, as to all Pro|ceedings of his Holine&s;s at pre&s;ent, or for the Future; and as to all Sentences which he may have given, or hereafter pronounce, to the Prejudice of the King, or the Prerogatives of his Crown, or of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects. Of all which, the Re&s;pect which he owes the Crown, has oblig'd him to
<PB N="32" REF="18"> come and give the Court an Account, and pre|&s;ent to their view the Act which he has made, wherein he cannot but acknowledge the Piety; Wi&s;dom and Moderation of the King in this par|ticular, which &s;eem to have extingui&s;h'd in the Per&s;on of the King, tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions that mo&s;t ve|hemently agitate other Men. He hopes that the Court will approve his Conduct, and a&s;&s;ures him|&s;elf that they will both zealou&s;ly and faithfully u&s;e all the Authority with which it has pleas'd the King to inve&s;t 'em, to maintain the Re&s;pect which is due to his Maje&s;ty, and to pre&s;erve the Prerogatives of his Crown, the Tranquillity of his Subjects, and the Liberties which are not only particular to the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church, but which &s;he has pre&s;erv'd with more Learning and Vigour then any other. Which things being con&s;ider'd, the Chamber Ordains,</P>
<P>That the &s;aid Act of Appeal be Regi&s;ter'd in the Regi&s;ters Office, that recour&s;e may be had to it, as occa&s;ion &s;erves, and that Thanks be return'd to the King for ordering his Advocate-General to proceed according to the U&s;ual Practi&s;e upon the &s;ame Occa&s;ions, and that the Fir&s;t Pre&s;ident do a&s;&s;ure the King in the Name of the whole Society of their Devotion to his &s;acred Per&s;on and his Ser|vice; and that they will at all times make u&s;e of that Authority which the King has conferr'd up|on 'em, to &s;upport the Prerogatives of the Crown, the Liberties of the Kingdom, and the Repo&s;e of his Subjects.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o further added by M. <HI>Harlay,</HI> the King's Coun&s;ellor in his Council of State, and his Advocate-General, That the Reputation and Piety of our Holy Father <HI>Innocent</HI> XI. cau&s;ing his Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="33" REF="18"> to rejoice at his Exaltation to the Pontificate, his Maje&s;ty endeavour'd to clo&s;e with his Holine&s;s, in order to a unanimous Care of what ever might be for the Glory and Service of God.</P>
<P>That his de&s;ires and the Progre&s;&s;es he made in or|der to &s;uch a Pious De&s;ign, not having had that Succe&s;s which he expected, the King however &s;till continu'd on his part to employ the Power which God has put into his hands for the pre&s;ervation of the Purity of the Faith in his Kingdom, and to bring back to the Bo&s;om of the Church a Great Number of Children that are gone a&s;tray, as al&s;o to afford the Church all the Protection, which &s;he could ex|pect from the Authority of a Great King: his Ma|je&s;ty al&s;o has edified by his Example, and in&s;tructed all his Subjects by his particular Piety.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, our Holy Father the Pope, to whom &s;o many wonderful Vertues and Actions ought to have render'd the Per&s;on of the King &s;o dear, has with great heat embrac'd the Com|plaint of the two Bi&s;hops about the Right of the Regale; and his Holine&s;s at the &s;ame time rejected the Te&s;timonies of all the re&s;t of the Prelates of the Kingdom, touching the Favours they have receiv'd from the King in that particular to the Prejudice of his Prerogatives.</P>
<P>He went about to take from the King's Em|ba&s;&s;adours at <HI>Rome</HI> the Franchi&s;es which they en|joy'd, even under his Pontificate, in a City where it became the Gratitude of the Popes to have pre|&s;erv'd to our Kings, more &s;ingular Marks of that Sovereignty, of which they formerly de&s;poil'd them&s;elves, to enrich the Holy See.</P>
<P>Our Holy Father has al&s;o look'd upon as a dan|gerous and &s;u&s;pected Doctrine, the Declaration
<PB N="34" REF="19"> which the A&s;&s;embly of the Clergy made in the Year 1682. of their Opinions concerning Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Power; at &s;uch a Conjuncture too, when &s;ome of his Predece&s;&s;ours would rather have been bani&s;h'd to the Extremities of the Earth, then have &s;uffer'd &s;o many New Converts.</P>
<P>He refus'd his Bulls to &s;everal Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks no|minated by the King to &s;upply the vacant Churches in his Kingdom.</P>
<P>The partial Behaviour of our Holy Father in reference to the Archbi&s;hoprick of <HI>Cologne;</HI> his Re&s;olute Refu&s;al to acknowledge or give Audi|ence to the King's Amba&s;&s;adour at that Conjun|cture; but thundering out Anathema's again&s;t him, and Interdicting him from St. <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Church in <HI>Rome,</HI> will perpetuate an Example almo&s;t Incre|dible to Po&s;terity of the King's Zeal for Religion, and his de&s;ire to pre&s;erve the Peace of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> and of the Pope's proceedings &s;o contrary to the Obligations of the Place which he &s;upplies.</P>
<P>Wherefore &s;eeing His Holine&s;s &s;tops his Ears to all the King's mo&s;t ju&s;t Complaints, we are con&s;train'd at length to defend our &s;elves, and to maintain the Dignity of the Crown, and the Re|po&s;e of the King's Subjects by the Rules of Ju&s;tice, at a time that his Maje&s;ty does the &s;ame, with &s;o much glory, by the Pui&s;&s;ance of his Armes.</P>
<P>Thereupon the King's &s;aid Advocate-General, having fir&s;t obtain'd the King's permi&s;&s;ion, de|clares, That he is Appellant in the King's behalf, and in behalf of all his Subjects to a Univer&s;al Council, which His Holine&s;s &s;hall be pleas'd to call in due and Canonical Form, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Prote&s;ting in the mean time in the Name and by the Expre&s;s Command
<PB N="35" REF="19"> of the King, that 'tis his Intention to remain inviolably devoted to the Holy See as the true Center of the Church's Unity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o &s;oon as our Holy Father, being better inform'd, &s;hall &s;hew the Equity, the Sentiments and Partiality of a Judge and common Father, his Maje&s;ty will pay to his Per&s;on the &s;ame Filial Re&s;pect, as he did before; and from which nothing but the ill Conduct of his Holine&s;s cau&s;es him to ab&s;tain.</P></Q>
<P>After the Court of <HI>France</HI> had put the&s;e unheard|of Affronts upon the Holy See, and thus debas'd the Authority of the Sovereign Pontiff, in&s;tead of ma|king u&s;e of tho&s;e means which the Catholick Church and Councils have put into his Hands to bring back Princes and People to their Chri&s;tian Duty, the Pope out of a peculiar Fund of Charity and Piety, contented him&s;elf with making appear to all the World, the Ju&s;tice of his Proceedings and the In|ju&s;tice of the <HI>French</HI> Court, declaring all along, that he was per&s;waded that the Truth of Affairs had never been truly repre&s;ented to the King of <HI>France;</HI> only that the Artifices and Pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who are no Lovers of Peace had infus'd into him an Idea altogether different. Otherwi&s;e that it was never to be believ'd that the King would have harbour'd in his Mind tho&s;e Injurious Sentiments contain'd in Cardinal <HI>d'E&s;tree</HI>'s Letter: his Holine&s;s having ne|ver fail'd to &s;hew him&s;elf a true Father to all Catho|licks, but more particularly to <HI>France;</HI> who upon &s;everal Occa&s;ions had receiv'd various Te&s;timonies of his Indulgence and E&s;teem; but in&s;tead of being repay'd with Grateful Acknowledgment, his Holine&s;s had been expos'd to mo&s;t heinous Injuries
<PB N="36" REF="20"> and Affronts not only offer'd to his Per&s;on but the Holy See, by extending the Regale to above half the the Churches in <HI>France</HI> that are no way &s;ubject to it; but by the Second General Council of <HI>Lion,</HI> by pre&s;cription of almo&s;t 400 Years. by the Te&s;timo|nies and Evidences of Edicts of &s;everal Kings, De|crees of Parliament, and Regi&s;ters of the Chamber of Accounts, as al&s;o by the Opinion of the mo&s;t ce|lebrated French Lawyers, ought to be exempted from it.</P>
<P>The Pope loudly complain'd of the Violence done to the Convents of the <HI>Carognes</HI> and <HI>Urbani&s;tes;</HI> and that, only for applying them&s;elves to the Holy See, in Oppo&s;ition to an Inva&s;ion of their Privi|leges, and the Canonical Rules of their Orders, which imports, That Abbots and Superiours ought to be Elective, and continue for three Years toge|ther. In contempt of which, the King had intro|duc'd Abbots of his own Nomination. Be&s;ides the Rending away of Five Abbies, without the con&s;ent of the Apo&s;tolick See, to erect a Commandery, and applying to Other u&s;es the Revenues po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by &s;everal Monks and Nuns, according to the Will of the Donours.</P>
<P>But that which was more enormous, was the King's Prohibiting the Bi&s;hops to have any Recour&s;e to the Pope, according to their Duty and the Cu|&s;tom of all Times, to ask his Coun&s;el in matter of Religion; as al&s;o in reference to what concern'd Prince <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Bavaria:</HI> tho' in granting him the Eligibility for three Churches that were Legally po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the deceas'd Electour of <HI>Cologne,</HI> all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> &s;aw that the Pope had no other Aim then the Publick Good. For be&s;ides the high Va|lue
<PB N="37" REF="20"> which it behov'd him to have for that Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e, the Merits of the Electour his Brother, who had &s;o gloriou&s;ly defended <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> again&s;t the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> his Holine&s;s had done nothing in that particular, but only imitated the Liberality of his Predece&s;&s;ours, who conferr'd the like and greater Favours al&s;o upon Per&s;ons much Inferiour in Birth, Age and Merit, then Prince <HI>Clement,</HI> and that too at the Reque&s;t of the Kings of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>And for the Bull granted to Prince <HI>Clement,</HI> the Pope could not be accus'd of any Inju&s;tice for &s;o doing, &s;ince that Affair was exactly and &s;eriou&s;ly examin'd in a Con&s;i&s;torial Congregation at <HI>Rome.</HI> Be&s;ides that the King of <HI>France</HI> had neither any Rea|&s;on nor Right to intermeddle in that Affair, &s;ince it was a Bu&s;ine&s;s that only related to a <HI>German</HI> Arch|bi&s;hoprick, and an Electour of the Empire, which no way concern'd <HI>France</HI> either directly or indirect|ly, but the Pope only in re&s;pect of Apo&s;tolick Con|firmation, and the Emperour, as to the Inve&s;titure of the Pincipality in admitting him into the Ele|ctoral College, to which belongs the Right of Electing a new Emperour, and which has a very great Sway in managing the Affairs of the whole Empire. So that the Pretence for War which <HI>France</HI> lays hold on from the Proceedings at <HI>Cologne</HI> is to be imputed to the King's Pa&s;&s;ion, and his own Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>After what pa&s;t in the A&s;&s;embly of &s;ome Part of the Clergy at <HI>Paris,</HI> where among other things, the King caus'd the Regale to be adjudg'd his Right, notwith&s;tanding the Appeal of the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Alets</HI> and <HI>Pami&s;e,</HI> to the Pope; and the Propo&s;itions &s;o injurious to the Apo&s;tolick See, &s;upported by Royal
<PB N="38" REF="21"> Edicts, enjoyning every Body to receive and pub|lickly profe&s;s and teach 'em in &s;uch a manner as was never yet practis'd, His Holine&s;s had great Rea&s;on to refu&s;e his Bulls to the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks no|minated by the King to &s;upply the vacant Bi&s;hop|ricks, becau&s;e they were pre&s;ent at the &s;aid A&s;&s;embly of 1682. and there openly declar'd them&s;elves E|nemies of the Apo&s;tolick See; and for that the Canon Law, and the Agreement made with <HI>France,</HI> that the Pope &s;hould be judge of the Capacity of the Per&s;ons nominated, prove moreover, That the &s;aid Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks nomianted by the King, were not Per|&s;ons proper to be entru&s;ted with the In&s;truction of the People, but ab&s;olutely addicted to their plea&s;ures, and their worldly Intere&s;ts, &s;eeing that they never &s;crupl'd to revolt again&s;t their Spiritual Chief, and to betray the Liberty and Privileges of the Church, to the end they might gain the King's Favour, and augment their Temporal Means. Upon this, the Court of <HI>France</HI> being de&s;irous to vex the Pope, made choice of the Marquis of <HI>Lovardin</HI> for his Emba&s;&s;adour to <HI>Rome,</HI> becau&s;e he was a Known Enemy of the Apo&s;tolick See, and was both able and willing to affront and mole&s;t his Holine&s;s. No wonder then if he never had Audience of the Pope, &s;eeing that according to the General Rule, no Mi|ni&s;ter &s;hould be &s;ent to a Soveraign Prince, but &s;uch a one as is acceptable to the Prince with whom he is to negotiate: be&s;ides that it is not &s;ufficient for a per&s;on to be &s;ent by a Prince, to entitle him to the Prerogatives of an Emba&s;&s;adour, but according to the Laws of Nations, he mu&s;t be acknowledg'd for &s;uch a one by the Soveraign to whom that Mi|ni&s;ter is &s;ent. Therefore the Court of <HI>France</HI> had
<PB N="39" REF="21"> no rea&s;on to complain that the Pope refus'd to give Audience to the Marquis. Nor indeed would any Soveraign have &s;uffer'd the Marquis, as he did, to enter <HI>Rome</HI> with Armed Force, as it were to de|prive him of one Part of his Sovereignty, and on purpo&s;e to affront him after &s;uch a manner, unheard of even among <HI>Barbarians</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>'Tis ob&s;ervable that when <HI>France</HI> has any occa&s;ion to court the Favour of the Holy See, &s;he &s;ends Pre|lates, Cardinals and Bi&s;hops for her Emba&s;&s;adours; in regard it is a Thing both decent and becoming Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the Pope; be&s;ides that they are allow'd Admittance, when Seculars are excluded. But when <HI>France</HI> has a mind to af|front the See, &s;he &s;ends a Lawyer or a Sword-man, who neither depends upon the Pope, nor expects any Kindne&s;s from him, and who dares ruffle him &s;toutly, when it is to promote the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France.</HI> But <HI>France</HI> &s;eeing the Pontiff inflexible, and that he was not to be gain'd either by his Nephew nor by the Cardinals that were mo&s;t Intimate with him, re&s;olv'd either to rid him out of the world or to wait for his Death. But Old Age &s;paring <HI>France</HI> the Labour of her fir&s;t de&s;ign, he was no &s;ooner dead, but <HI>France</HI> began her old Cu&s;tom of making Parties, and &s;cattering her Louidores up and down <HI>Rome,</HI> to purcha&s;e a Pope of her own Faction; and the Lot fell upon a <HI>Venetian, Ottoboni,</HI> who took upon him the Name of <HI>Alexander</HI> VIII. <HI>France</HI> thought him her Friend, and attributed the whole Glory of his Election to her &s;elf. But &s;he found him to be a <HI>Venetian,</HI> that is to &s;ay, one that conceal'd his real Sentiments as long as he liv'd, and never declar'd him&s;elf till he came to lie upon his Death-Bed; but
<PB N="40" REF="22"> then he did it in &s;uch a Manner as was no way for the Advantage of <HI>France.</HI> Now in regard he was very Old, and de&s;irous to make the be&s;t of tho&s;e few Years he had to live, to rai&s;e the Fortune of his Family, the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters fail'd not to be li|beral of their inchanting Golden Philters, to allure his Kindred into the Intere&s;ts of the <HI>French</HI> Court. But how willing &s;oever, or how Importunate to Ob|lige their Uncle to do &s;omething in favour of the King, could never procure from him any thing more, but only that while he held the Pon|tificate he did <HI>France</HI> neither good nor harm. How|ever, the <HI>Italians</HI> &s;ay this of him, That he did like the Swan, that is, he Sung a little before his Death. Neverthele&s;s <HI>France</HI> &s;uffer'd patiently that petty Mortification, and the lo&s;s of all her Pre&s;ents to the Family of the <HI>Ottoboni,</HI> in hopes to have at length a Pontiff more favourable to her Purpo&s;es. At la&s;t after much canva&s;&s;ing, mo&s;t Voices were for a Neopolitan, of the Family of <HI>Pignatelli,</HI> whom the Cardinals of the <HI>French</HI> Faction would not ex|clude, upon his promi&s;e to the <HI>French</HI> Cardinals that the <HI>French</HI> Court &s;hould have no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfy'd with his Pontificate. But being elected he forgot the Promi&s;es he had made, the rather be|cau&s;e the Imperial and Spani&s;h Emba&s;&s;adours di&s;|&s;waded him, as much as lay in their Power, from the ob&s;ervance of 'em. The Court of <HI>France</HI> there|fore finding that they had to do with one that was not le&s;s weak in Mind then infirm in Body, pre&s;s'd it upon him that he would occa&s;ion the damnation of a great number of People that were without Pa&s;tours, if he per&s;i&s;ted in the Refu&s;al of his Bulls to the Bi&s;hops of <HI>France,</HI> who were pre&s;ent at the A&s;|&s;embly
<PB N="41" REF="22"> of the Clergy in the Year 1682. And at the &s;ame time the <HI>French</HI> Cardinals, according to their In&s;tructions, gave the Pontiff to under&s;tand, that a War was very near breaking out in <HI>Italy,</HI> and that he would be an&s;werable for the Blood that &s;hould be &s;pilt; &s;eeing the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King's Patience was at an end, and that mo&s;t certainly he would withdraw him&s;elf from his Obedience to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;et up a Patriarch in his own Kingdom, and thereby retain &s;everal Millions that went every year to <HI>Rome.</HI> Thereupon, tho&s;e Fears that u&s;ually &s;eize People &s;uperannuated, and the Delicacy of Con&s;cience without any nece&s;&s;ity of a Pontiff, made him determine to &s;atisfie the Court of <HI>France,</HI> upon frivolous Promi&s;es that the Bi&s;hops &s;hould &s;ubmit, tho' to the prejudice of the Holy See; &s;ince the King retracted nothing of what he had done publickly again&s;t the Authority of the Pontiffs and the Religion of the See, and for that the Re|gi&s;ters of the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> (containing the Inju|rious Appeal of the King's Advocate-General) &s;till remain upon Record, and for that <HI>France</HI> will one day revive it again, when &s;he finds a favourable Op|portunity to humble the Court of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>Neither the Pope nor the Holy See are to judge of the Catholicity of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. or his Court by the Pa&s;&s;ion which he has &s;hown in per&s;ecuting the <HI>Huguenots</HI> within his Kingdom. So far from that, &s;eeing that while the French Monarch per&s;ecuted the <HI>Huguenots</HI> in his own Realm, and de&s;troy'd their Churches and their Exerci&s;es, he &s;uccour'd Count <HI>Teckeli,</HI> the Head of the &s;ame Sect, that were re|volted from their Soveraign in <HI>Hungary:</HI> and the Court of <HI>France</HI> was not only more clo&s;ely Ally'd
<PB N="42" REF="23"> for his &s;ake with the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, to which he al|&s;o gave con&s;iderable A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but made Vows for the Pro&s;perity of the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> and repair'd their Mo&s;ques even as far as <HI>Vienna</HI> it &s;elf. More|over, I have frequently heard the Director of my Con&s;cience &s;ay, and have heard &s;everal of the queint Doctors of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> preach, that the Fruits of the Chri&s;tian Religion were Charity, and that he who was void of it could not be a True Catholick; that Charity was a Vertue which produc'd a Patient Spirit, that it was benign, that it was not covetous of other mens Goods, nor &s;ought its own advanta|ges; that it neither commits Inju&s;tice nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es any thing unju&s;tly got: that it endures every thing, believes every thing, bears with every thing; ne|ver carries it &s;elf in&s;olently or di&s;hone&s;tly. This is the Character of a True Chri&s;tian, according to the Learned. Now if the Pope finds but one of the&s;e Vertues in the King of <HI>France,</HI> I mean that Since|rity which Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> requir'd from a true Ca|tholick, which con&s;i&s;ts in fulfilling by our Actions what we have promis'd in Word: in that ca&s;e I agree, that the Pope may not only embrace him as his Elde&s;t Son, but canonize him after his Death, and I will be the fir&s;t that will pay my Homage to the Great St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> If it be enquir'd, From whence this way of proceeding ari&s;es, &s;o different and irregular in reference to the Holy See, more e&s;pecially in a King who adorns him&s;elf with the Title of Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian; I an&s;wer, that 'tis from hence, becau&s;e that whatever he took in hand was for the Service of that Great and Ambitious De&s;ign which aim'd at nothing le&s;s then to be the Ma&s;ter of all <HI>Europe.</HI> To which purpo&s;e he had it in view,

For this Rea&s;on you &s;ee that <HI>France</HI> is always upon the Enquiry; Her Emi&s;&s;aries continually inform them&s;elves what Territories, what Splendour others enjoy, that their Monarch may have an Opportunity to fall upon This or t'Other, or Both together. Envious Per&s;ons are as it were the Animated Skeletons of Demons, that are nouri&s;h'd only by their own Torments. <HI>Agrip|pina,</HI> the Mother of <HI>Nero,</HI> was wont to &s;ay, <HI>That there was nothing in the World which a Prince ought not to Sacrifice for a Crown.</HI> And therefore it was, that <HI>Katherine de Medicis,</HI> Queen of <HI>France,</HI> finding her &s;elf ready to &s;ink under the Burden of the Civil Wars, after the death of her Son <HI>Francis</HI> II. and not knowing any longer, after &s;he had tyr'd 'em all out, to what Saint to recommend her &s;elf, went to the Devil with her three Younger Children, <HI>Charles</HI> IX. the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Alan&s;on.</HI> And the Medal is &s;till to be &s;een with this Device beneath her Figure, engrav'd in Copper, and the Figures of her three Children which &s;he offer'd to the De|mon, <HI>Soit, pourvu que je regne.

<PB N="44" REF="24"> their Ambition &s;o high for a &s;ingle Crown, what may it not be Lawful for <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. to do, &s;o he may gain the Univer&s;al Monarchy? For &s;till what|ever he does, the <HI>French</HI> have a Name for it; they call it <HI>Grandeur of Soul.</HI> They offer Incen&s;e at this very day to the Divinity of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, and below his Statue, the Head of which is environ'd with a Glory, there are written the&s;e Bla&s;phemous words, <HI>Numini Ludovici Magni.</HI> This is the Reli|gion, and this is the Idol of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and of their Emi&s;&s;aries, that compa&s;s the Earth to make Pro&s;elytes to embrace and adore the Intere&s;ts of <HI>France.</HI> If among &s;uch proceedings as the&s;e, if in &s;uch a Dreary Chaos, the Holy See can find out <HI>Ca|tholicity,</HI> I will acknowledge him to be like God him&s;elf, who alone can bring Light out of Dark|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>But <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. was not content with the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> nor to make him&s;elf Emperour, but to be the Univer&s;al Monarch of the World, and then not having any more to conquer here below, like the Gyants of Old he would have built a Tow|er to &s;cale Heaven, and Dragoon the Inhabitants of the Eternal Man&s;ions. However the Soveraign KING of Kings, who derides the Folly of Men, has in a good Mea&s;ure confounded the Coun&s;els of <HI>France,</HI> and di&s;&s;ipated all her Great De&s;igns; parti|cularly &s;ince the rai&s;ing the Siege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> upon the 12th. of <HI>September</HI> 1683. a fatal day for <HI>France,</HI> but glorious for the Emperour and Empire, and Happy for all <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> This unexpected Blow, contrary to the Hopes and Expectations of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. and his Mini&s;ters, con&s;train'd him to &s;eek a Truce, which was granted him for Twenty years;
<PB N="45" REF="24"> and by which the Policy of <HI>France</HI> had a fair Pro|&s;pect of Keeping tho&s;e Towns of which &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s; and on the other &s;ide had gain'd time to &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue of the War between the two Empires, with a De&s;ign however, as already has been &s;aid, no longer to ob&s;erve the Truce, till the King beheld the Fate of the Two contending Parties. If the Emperour fell, then the King was to march in Per|&s;on into <HI>Germany,</HI> and cau&s;e him&s;elf to be proclaim'd Emperour and Protectour of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> at the Head of his Army. If the Grand Signior had the wor&s;t of it, then the King was to &s;end his Forces to his Aid, by ravaging all <HI>Germany,</HI> and dividing the Forces of the Empire, as he did under imagi|nary Pretences; which was more then openly to Succour the <HI>Turks,</HI> who in Truth had broken with the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> barely upon the Sollicitations of Count <HI>Teckeli</HI> and the King of <HI>France,</HI> promi&s;ing great A&s;|&s;i&s;tances, if they happen'd to prove the weake&s;t, and in that alone the <HI>French</HI> Monarch may be &s;aid to have kept his Word. 'Tis al&s;o no le&s;s true that his own Intere&s;t was at the Bottom, he not enduring to behold the Pro&s;perity of the Imperial Arms; and fearing lea&s;t the Emperour, proving Victorious, &s;hould one day re-demand the Towns and Territories which he had u&s;urp'd from him.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> then &s;eeing the Emperour's Succe&s;s, the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> winning Battel after Battel, the <HI>Turks</HI> dri|ven beyond <HI>Belgrade,</HI> his De&s;ign upon <HI>Cologne</HI> fru|&s;trated, the Baron of <HI>Plettenberg</HI> cho&s;en Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> the Baron of <HI>Elderen</HI> elected Prince and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Liege,</HI> and by this means all the va&s;t De|&s;igns of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. quite ranvers'd, &s;he was no longer to be re&s;train'd within the Bounds of a Truce,

<P>There is no que&s;tion but that <HI>France</HI> was &s;en&s;ible of her Errour, after the Revolution in <HI>England;</HI> for which rea&s;on &s;he di&s;charg'd all her Fury upon poor <HI>Germany,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> Soldiery exercis'd the utmo&s;t Extremities of Cruelty and Barbari&s;m, be|cau&s;e that Electorate belong'd to the Emperour's near Relation and Confederate.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> being thus Embark'd upon this Tempe&s;tu|ous Sea, the Pro&s;perity of the Imperial Arms, the Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> and the &s;trict League of all the Confederate Princes for the Defence of the Common Cau&s;e could not choo&s;e but rai&s;e prodi|gious Storms about his Ears; and therefore finding there was no repairing the Fault &s;he had commit|ted, &s;he was con&s;train'd to care&s;s and promi&s;e the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port whatever Succour the Infidels de|manded both of Men and Money to oblige the <HI>Turks</HI> to continue the War. With a De&s;ign however to deceive and for&s;ake 'em, &s;o &s;oon as the Court of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould find it convenient to agree with the
<PB N="48" REF="26"> Emperour. But in regard the <HI>French</HI> have drawn in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, and blinded with their Pre|&s;ents the Principal Mini&s;ters, and more e&s;pecially the Mufti, who holds his Dignity for Life, 'tis al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to open the Eyes of the Grand Sultan, who is willing to flatter him&s;elf with the Hopes of recovering that part of <HI>Hungary</HI> which he ha&s;t lo&s;t. So that as long as the <HI>French</HI> are able to domineer at the Port as they do, 'tis in vain to &s;end Emba&s;&s;adours thither, to make propo&s;als of Peace, &s;ince it &s;o ab&s;olutely behoves the Court Politicks of <HI>France</HI> to hinder it, by all manner of means, co&s;t what it will, either by Money or Poy&s;on, as we have &s;een. 'Tis not long &s;ince, that the <HI>French</HI> per|ceiv'd, that the Mini&s;ters of the Mediatours had made &s;ome Progre&s;s in the Interim that our Mini|&s;ter was ha&s;tning to the Port; but their Emi&s;&s;aries both at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> and <HI>Adrianople</HI> overturn'd with Money all the Mea&s;ures that had been taken. So that there is nothing but an In&s;urrection in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, that can ranver&s;e the Practices and Machinations of <HI>France;</HI> and this is that which the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> ought to meditate, if they de&s;ire a Peace between the two Empires; and there are ways to bring it about, if they would but put 'em in Practice.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be que&s;tion'd but that <HI>France</HI> drives on all the Intrigues imaginable in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, where &s;he is in daily fear, lea&s;t early or late a &s;ud|den Truce &s;hould be clap'd up between the two Empires, by rea&s;on of &s;ome unexpected In&s;urrecti|on, as I have already &s;aid. And therefore it is, that the Court of <HI>France</HI> endeavours to &s;upplant her Confederate, and to make a Peace with the Empe|rour and the Empire, by re&s;toring &s;everal Places
<PB N="49" REF="26"> which &s;he now holds in <HI>Germany;</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and his Mini&s;ters &s;ee very well, that they can|not continue the War, &s;o long as the Confedera|cy continue their Union, as hitherto they have done: that being alone by him&s;elf to bear the Bur|then of &s;o many Enemies, he &s;tands in need of Nu|merous Armies to oppo&s;e the &s;ame Adver&s;aries that environ him on every &s;ide, in <HI>Germany, Flanders, Bra|bant, Catalogna, Navarr</HI> and <HI>Piemont;</HI> but above all, the Conjoyn'd Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> that threaten his Coa&s;ts, and enforce him to an Ex|ce&s;&s;ive Expence to guard him&s;elf from a De&s;cent: his Trade being quite lo&s;t, his Subjects reduc'd to utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery, and his Exchequer decrea&s;ing every day, through the decay of Trade, and the Poverty of the Inhabitants of his Kingdom. We mu&s;t be|lieve, that <HI>France</HI> would fain have a Peace, while &s;he thinks &s;he has &s;ome Advantage, before any Ter|rible Blow befall her, which would enforce <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, to accept of &s;uch a Peace as it would plea&s;e the Emperour and the Confederates to afford him. 'Tis no le&s;s certain then, that his Imperial Maje&s;ty, together with the Confederates, have no more to do then to continue the War a little longer, to compa&s;s their Ends upon <HI>France,</HI> that can never be able to make Head again&s;t 'em for any long time. Which is the rea&s;on that we find her already begin|ning to change her Batteries, at the &s;ame time that &s;he &s;ees her &s;elf oblig'd to alter her De&s;igns in re|&s;pect of the Empire. Formerly nothing would &s;erve <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. but the Imperial Crown for him&s;elf, and the Title of King of the <HI>Romans</HI> for the <HI>Dauphin</HI> his Son.

Heaven has alter'd the Face of Affairs, by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Armes, and thereby confounding the Coun|&s;els of <HI>France;</HI> the de&s;igns of both being the &s;ame, and both acting in order to the &s;ame Ends.</P>
<P>And as the De&s;igns of <HI>France</HI> are chang'd in re|&s;pect of the Emperour, who is the Chief and Head of the Empire, &s;o they may be pre&s;um'd to be the &s;ame in regard of the Electours, who are the Members of it: Formerly, 'twas the Policy of <HI>France</HI> to care&s;s 'em one after another, to dazle 'em with the Gran|deur of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, and per&s;wade 'em to &s;ide with the Intere&s;ts of that Monarch; &s;paring neither for Promi&s;es nor Pre&s;ents to render 'em inclinable to elect <HI>French</HI> Coadjutours. But afterwards they were clearly convinc'd that this was the Apple of Di&s;|cord which the King of <HI>France</HI> threw into the Em|pire, to the End he might &s;wallow 'em up one after another. Now therefore let us &s;ee what new cour&s;e he takes to manage the Princes of the Empire. They can now no longer be &s;erviceable to him in ma|king the <HI>Dauphin</HI> King of the Romans, in regard they have Check-mated him on that &s;ide already. So that they have &s;par'd him a world of Trouble, and a great deal of Money which he was wont
<PB N="51" REF="27"> to throw away by Shovel-fulls upon that Occa&s;ion. Much le&s;s is it to be thought that <HI>Lewis</HI> has now any Hopes of being Emperour, &s;ince I am told, that the Book entitul'd, <HI>The ju&s;t Preten&s;ions of the King to the Empire,</HI> written by the Sieur <HI>Aubri,</HI> Advocate in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;erves now to no other u&s;e, then to wrap up Butter and Chee&s;e in the Chandlers Shops.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;try of <HI>France</HI> now labours to &s;eparate the Electours and Princes of the Empire from the common cau&s;e (not by the means of Gold or Silver becau&s;e he finds 'em incorruptible) but by inva|ding their Territories by Fire and Sword, as he has done the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> the Dioce&s;es of <HI>Cologne, Mayence</HI> and <HI>Treves,</HI> with a de&s;ign to enforce 'em to per|&s;wade the Emperour to accept of a Separate Peace; by which means <HI>France</HI> will remain the Mi&s;tre&s;s &s;till of the Greate&s;t part of all her U&s;urpations. To which purpo&s;e &s;he makes a dextrous U&s;e of the ea&s;ie Acce&s;s which the Monks and Je&s;uits have to the Per&s;ons of the Roman Catholick Princes, and to intrude among the Mini&s;ters of State, every where extolling the King's Catholicity, and his great de&s;ign to have exterminated Here&s;ie, had not King <HI>James</HI> been dethron'd. But &s;ome have &s;aid very well in An&s;wer to tho&s;e Emi&s;&s;aries, that all tho&s;e forward Acts of &s;eeming Zeal were no other then a &s;ort of Clum&s;ie Trapans; that they mu&s;t go and tell their Stories to Children and Fools, for that they were no Strangers to the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Religion.</P>
<P>There is one thing very Remarkable, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. de&s;igning the De&s;truction of the Empire, was the occa&s;ion of the &s;trengthning it, and of under|propping
<PB N="52" REF="28"> it in &s;ome mea&s;ure with new Supports, by adding a Ninth Electour to the Electoral College, and more particularly by the Choice which the Em|perour and the Electours have made of the Duke of <HI>Hanover,</HI> to &s;upply that Place, to the great Grief of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> who with all her wilely Stra|tagems and fal&s;e Politicks, could not prevent it. The Election of a King of the <HI>Romans,</HI> of Prince <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to the Electorate of <HI>Cologne,</HI> of the Baron of <HI>Elderen</HI> to the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Liege,</HI> of the Baron of <HI>Plettenberg</HI> to that of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> but more e&s;pecially the Revolution in <HI>England,</HI> were bitter Mor&s;els for the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to &s;wallow, and &s;till lie heavy upon his Stomach. And whenever <HI>France</HI> comes once to &s;ee the Bottom of her Exche|quer, there is no que&s;tion but her Fall will be very great, &s;ince it was her Money that only upheld her in all the Courts of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> that &s;he has plai|&s;ter'd over all her U&s;urpations, and that &s;he has lull'd &s;everal Princes a&s;leep, who&s;e real Intere&s;t it was to oppo&s;e her. Silver is a &s;ort of Mettal every where acceptable, and the Avarice of the <HI>Switzers</HI> has &s;pread it &s;elf into &s;everal Courts, according to the &s;aying of <HI>Alexander, That there was nothing inacce&s;&s;i|ble to Silver:</HI> tho' <HI>Matchiavell</HI> upholds, <HI>That 'tis a hard matter for Steel to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which is purcha&s;ed with Gold.</HI> Neverthele&s;s we have &s;een the Contrary both in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> where the King of <HI>France</HI> bought &s;everal Places with good rea|dy Money, and has held 'em for &s;everal Years. But give me leave to add this Rea&s;on for it, I mean the little good Corre&s;pondence at that time between the Princes of the Empire, and the Powder of Gold which their <HI>Jupiter</HI> rain'd among 'em. That Mo|narch
<PB N="53" REF="28"> not only got great Footing within the Terri|tories of his Neighbours, but made his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion good.

And this is a Truth never to be contra|dicted, that the Sincere Union of the Princes of the Empire pre&s;erves 'em from being corrupted, and early or late will render 'em Victorious over the Common Enemy, and put 'em in a Condition of being able to recover what they have, and fix 'em in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they hold untouch'd. No wonder then that the <HI>French</HI> de&s;troy and ruine <HI>Ger|many</HI> where they come, becau&s;e they find they can|not hold it, but mu&s;t &s;urrender back all their U&s;ur|pations: tho' by the Havock which they make, they are in hopes to weaken the Strength of their Enemies. 'Twould be but Ju&s;tice then, and what the King of <HI>France</HI> has no &s;uch rea&s;on to wonder at, that he &s;hould be one day con&s;train'd to repay the Damages, for the Spoil which his Armies have com|mitted, in pur&s;uance of his Infernal Politicks.</P>
<P>During the Reign of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. King of <HI>Spain,</HI> it may be &s;aid, that <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> divided <HI>Europe</HI> between 'em; and that they were truly the Two Scales of a Ballance, which the Other Soveraigns endeavour'd to keep in an Equilibrium, and &s;ided &s;ometimes with the One, &s;ometimes with the Other, as their Intere&s;t directed 'em, in order to keep an Equality of Force, for fear of being &s;wallow'd up
<PB N="54" REF="29"> by the Stronge&s;t. But &s;ince King <HI>Philip</HI>'s time, it may be &s;aid, That <HI>Spain</HI> has been continually &s;ink|ing lower and lower; that &s;he has been in good part the Prey of <HI>France;</HI> and that had it not been for the Allies, the French at this Hour would have been not only Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> but of <HI>Madrid</HI> it &s;elf. And indeed it may be &s;aid, that the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> lent the fir&s;t helping Hand to the fall of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Pui&s;&s;ance, by his Proclamation con|cerning the Tenth Penny in the Year 1569. by his Depriving the People of the Liberty of Con&s;cience, and the <HI>Ma&s;&s;acers</HI> that &s;ucceeded, and which was the real Cau&s;e of the Revolt of part of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and the Fountain and Original of all the Misfortunes that afterwards befell that Monarchy, which in&s;tead of &s;triking Dread and Terrour into all <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Other World, is dwindl'd away to that degree of Impui&s;&s;ance wherein we now behold it; govern'd 'tis true, by one of the be&s;t Princes in the World, leading a Pious and Exemplary Life, and void of any Vicious Inclination: and it may be certainly &s;aid, that the People and Grandees of the Kingdom are happy under &s;o Ju&s;t a King, if they under&s;tood their Felicity, and would but corre&s;pond with the Pacifick Genius of their Prince. But mo&s;t com|monly the Mini&s;ters and their Adherents make their Advantage of the Good Nature of their Prince to fill their own Pur&s;es by emptying his, and by that means deprive him of his Ability to with&s;tand the Sworn Enemy of <HI>Spain,</HI> who environs him on every &s;ide, and who for more then one Age together, has &s;tudy'd nothing but his utter Ruine, and makes a dextrous u&s;e of his Imbecility. The King of <HI>France</HI> has been a long time acquainted with the Con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="55" REF="29"> of the pre&s;ent Catholick King, and upon that Knowledge it is that the Policy of <HI>France</HI> has built her De&s;igns, and &s;o well under&s;tood to carry on her Affairs, that &s;he brought about a Marriage of that Monarch with a Prince&s;s of <HI>France,</HI> Daugh|ter to the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> and that meerly to be inform'd of what pa&s;t even in this Catholick Maje|&s;ty's Bed-Chamber, as was &s;een by the Relations frequent in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> and which meerly &s;erv'd for Sport among the <HI>French</HI> Ladies, who are naturally enclin'd to Go&s;&s;ipry, Tittle Tattle, and Railliery. And therefore 'tis a pernicious &s;ort of Po|licy in the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> to be&s;tow the Daugh|ters of <HI>Spain</HI> upon <HI>France,</HI> and to match their Sove|raigns with the Daughters of <HI>France:</HI> and of this there are recent Proofs that make us &s;en&s;ible. For it is certain that the Marriage of the Infanta <HI>Maria Tere&s;a</HI> to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has brought nothing but War and continual Trouble upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;till will be|come the Occa&s;ion of More, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Dau|phin</HI>'s Preten&s;ions, in ca&s;e the Catholick King hap|pens to dye without Heirs. 'Twill be in vain then to alledge that <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. at his Marriage re|nounc'd his Claims with a Solemn Oath: for if he brake his Oath, and all the Princes blame him for doing an unlawful and unju&s;t Act, tending to U&s;urpa|tion, a Sin again&s;t Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience: 'tis pre|&s;ently told ye, that he could do nothing to the Pre|judice of a Third Per&s;on, meaning the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the only Off&s;pring by that Marriage; and u&s;ually in &s;uch differences between Soveraigns, the longe&s;t Sword carries it. <HI>Ratio ultima, Regnum,</HI> was the Motto which Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> caus'd to be engrav'd upon the Armes of <HI>France.</HI> Or if it be not
<PB N="56" REF="30"> rea&s;on, 'tis the definitive Will of Kings, and be|comes Rea&s;on, if once it proves &s;ucce&s;sful. The want of I&s;&s;ue by the Catholick King's &s;econd Mar|riage with the Prince&s;s <HI>Palatine</HI> of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> increa|&s;es and &s;wells the Ambition of <HI>France;</HI> and 'tis very probable, that <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. would not be wil|ling that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould happen to dye (which God forbid) during his being enga'd in a War with almo&s;t all <HI>Europe;</HI> in regard that not ha|ving his Hands free, he could not &s;o ea&s;ily fall upon <HI>Spain</HI> with a &s;ufficient Force, as he might be able to do, to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of that Monarchy, in pro&s;ecution of his Hopes and Preten&s;ions, if his Ca|tholick Maje&s;ty did not prevent him, in his Life|time. 'Tis the Policy of <HI>France</HI> to in&s;inuate into the Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> de&s;ires of enriching them&s;elves, while they have an Opportunity; to the end that after his Death, they may be able to erect Petty So|vereignties in every Corner of the Kingdom, for there is not any Prince among 'em who wants a Preten&s;ion, with a promi&s;e to every one that &s;he will &s;tand by Him, and grant him her Protection again&s;t all A&s;&s;ailants; They not con&s;idering all this while, that <HI>France</HI> will at la&s;t &s;wallow 'em all up, one after another, and that they will become the Sport of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, their &s;ecret Enemy. Who in the mean time by this means enfeebles <HI>Spain,</HI> ex|tenuates the King's Trea&s;ure, and deprives him not only of the power to recover the Places he has lo&s;t, but to defend tho&s;e which he has yet in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which the <HI>French</HI> wre&s;t from him by degrees, be|cau&s;e that <HI>Spain</HI> is not in a Condition to make a Po|tent Oppo&s;ition; as Experience had taught us too apparently, not only during the War, but al&s;o in
<PB N="57" REF="30"> time of Peace. For that &s;ince the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Peace, <HI>Spain</HI> has &s;uffer'd the U&s;urpation of a great many Provinces, as <HI>Burgundy, Franche Cont&eacute;,</HI> and Con&s;i|derable Portions of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and <HI>Catalonia.</HI> And all this, becau&s;e that <HI>Spain</HI> is a langui&s;hing and &s;ickly Body, who&s;e Forces wa&s;te by degrees, through the too much &s;oftne&s;s of the Soveraign, and the Greedy Covetou&s;ne&s;s of the Grandees of the Kingdom. Whereas if the Catholick King would make u&s;e of his Authority; for&s;ake his Cabinet and Head his Armes, there is no que&s;tion but that the Face of his Affairs would quickly alter. It be|hoves him for the repleni&s;hing of his Coffers to &s;queeze the Spunges that have &s;well'd them&s;elves with his Trea&s;ures, and enrich'd them&s;elves at the Expences of his Crown and People. A Prince that leads a Soft and Effeminate Life is neither fear'd by his Enemies, nor belov'd by his People. He is lookt upon as a Statue, and re&s;embles tho&s;e that wi&s;h for mighty Things, as if they de&s;ign'd to leave only their Dreams to Po&s;terity. Whereas a Monarch ought with his own Sword to make the Pen that is to write his Hi&s;tory: that is to &s;ay, that his Valour and Prowe&s;s ought to afford his Hi&s;toriographer, Mat|ter: otherwi&s;e he only &s;erves to fill up the Cata|logue of the Kings, and the Day of his Birth, and the Day of his Death are the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious and Memorable Parts of all his Hi&s;tory. A King re|ceives his Crown from his Ance&s;tors, but his Re|nown mu&s;t &s;pring from him&s;elf. The Council of <HI>Spain</HI> falls a&s;leep pre&s;ently after a Peace, and many times after a Truce, not con&s;idering that <HI>France</HI> is always awake, and that &s;he never lays down her Armes but that it Co&s;ts the King of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;ome or
<PB N="58" REF="31"> other of his be&s;t Towns. It would be &s;uperfluous to &s;et forth in Painting to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the mi&s;ery of their Condition, &s;hould they once fall under the De&s;potick Dominion of <HI>France.</HI> They need no more then ca&s;t their Eyes upon the lamentable and wretched E&s;tate to which the <HI>French</HI> are at this day reduc'd; while &s;ome are forc'd to wander about the World, expos'd to utmo&s;t Mi&s;ery, to Hunger and Cold, and all this meerly to avoid the Cruelty and Tyranny of their Monarch; and they that remain behind, lie Groaning under the weight of his Iron Scepter that continually brui&s;es 'em to death with his Oppre&s;&s;ions and his Impo&s;ts. The only way therefore for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to prevent their Ruine, is to countermine the Policy of <HI>France:</HI> to &s;uppli|cate their Monarch to appoint his Succe&s;&s;our in his Life-time; to the end he may be bred up in the Court of <HI>Madrid,</HI> and be ready to oppo&s;e the Inva&s;ions of <HI>France</HI> after the King's decea&s;e. But more e&s;pecially to beg of the Emperour to put a &s;peedy End to the Turki&s;h War, that he may have his Hands at Li|berty to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to <HI>Spain</HI> at a time of need.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o an Affair of Great Importance, and mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential toward the Pre&s;ervation of the Remainder of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and not to relie as the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> does upon her Neighbours; which is the rea&s;on that they neglect to &s;end the True Succour, which it would behove 'em to &s;end in time into tho&s;e Provinces which were within a Fingers Breadth of being utterly lo&s;t, during King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign. And indeed there happen &s;o many Changes and Revolutions in the World, that a well advis'd Mo|narch ought never to relie upon the Forces of Other Princes but his own.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="31">
<P>While the Provinces of the Spani&s;h Low-Coun|tries were govern'd by Intere&s;ted Vice-Roys, who preferr'd their own private Concerns, before the Pre&s;ervation of the Provinces, with which they were entru&s;ted, we &s;till found that <HI>France</HI> &s;eiz'd up|on City after City, and is now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of whole Provinces; and it may be &s;aid that a better thought never came into her Head, then when &s;he abandon'd the Conque&s;t of <HI>Italy</HI> (where &s;he Ex|hau&s;ted her Men and Money) to turn her Forces upon <HI>Flanders,</HI> where all Appearances &s;eem'd more ea&s;ie, &s;ince &s;he &s;aw well that Governours were &s;ent thither only to enrich them&s;elves: among whom the Greate&s;t Part minded more the getting of a Million into their Pur&s;es, then the pre&s;ervation of the Be&s;t City in the <HI>Low-Countries!</HI> To avoid which Mi&s;chief, there is a nece&s;&s;ity of having a Prince for Governour, who&s;e particular Intere&s;t it is to pre|&s;erve 'em, who will march at the Head of his Ar|my, lay out the Sub&s;idies of the People, in defraying the Nece&s;&s;ary Expences of the People, and take care for the Timely Returns of Money; for that the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> can never &s;ub&s;i&s;t without an Army well pay'd.</P>
<P>We have met with all the&s;e Advantages in the Per&s;on of his Electoral Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Ba|varia;</HI> and it may be &s;aid without flattery, That the Choice which his Catholick Maje&s;ty made of that Prince for the Government of the <HI>Low-Coun|tries,</HI> was one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t important Hits of State that <HI>Spain</HI> has been for &s;ome time guilty of. Twas &s;uch a Blow to <HI>France,</HI> as broke all the Mea|&s;ures &s;he had taken, during the Government of <HI>Ga&s;tanaga;</HI> nor could <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. ward off this
<PB N="60" REF="32"> Blow which the King of <HI>England</HI> gave him, without ever giving him warning to guard him&s;elf.</P>
<P>'Tis a thing no le&s;s ob&s;ervable then wonderful, That the Council of <HI>Spain</HI> having no more then this little Corner of the Earth to guard, &s;hould neglect it as They do; &s;eeing that good Policy re|quires, that <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould drein her&s;elf, rather then part with it, were it for nothing el&s;e but to &s;erve her as an Amuzement to the Arms of <HI>France,</HI> as we have found it to have been in all the la&s;t and pre&s;ent Wars, and the Counterguard that keeps the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King from Marching to the very Walls of <HI>Madrid</HI> it &s;elf. The rea&s;on of this Carele&s;sne&s;s may well be thought to be the Popular Errour of the Inhabitants of <HI>Flanders</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> who tell the Hollanders, when they upbraid 'em with their Re|mi&s;sne&s;s as to their own Pre&s;ervation, <HI>'Tis you that ought to defend us, for the &s;ake of your own Interest.</HI> And indeed, there is &s;ome rea&s;on for this Opinion. But the chief rea&s;on proceeds from the Avarice of the Spani&s;h Mini&s;ters, who &s;hroud them&s;elves under this Mi&s;take, which &s;erves 'em to heap up Wealth, while the King their Sovereign is engag'd on every &s;ide to pre&s;erve him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Policy of <HI>France,</HI> together with her Louid'ors, works now the &s;ame Effect with the which formerly <HI>Philip</HI> II. wrought by virtue of his Doublon's. For I have heard &s;ay, That ev'n in Time of Peace, there was not any Place in the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> where <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. had not his Creatures and his Cabals rea|dy to declare them&s;elves in Time and Place, and when an Opportunity requir'd. And certain it is, That if this were not the whole which was then &s;aid, 'tis
<PB N="61" REF="32"> a good part of the Truth. For having beheld what we have &s;een in our days, in reference to that impregnable City of <HI>Luxemburgh,</HI> and the Acqui&s;i|tion of the whole Province that follow'd, we ought to be convinc'd, that that &s;ame Place of &s;o great mo|ment was not obtain'd by the Bravery and Courage only of the French. There is no better way then, to di&s;appoint tho&s;e Treacheries, then by often chan|ging the Garri&s;ons, and &s;ometimes the Governors them&s;elves; but above all things, to Pay well, and Puni&s;h without Exception, when there is the lea&s;t Fault committed. The <HI>Low-Countries</HI> are, at pre|&s;ent, like an In&s;olvent Hou&s;e, that mu&s;t be re-&s;ettl'd by good Oeconomy, and by affording the Inha|bitants the Means of being able to contribute to|wards it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Low-Countries</HI> have a long time been the Mark at which the Court of <HI>France</HI> has aim'd. Upon the lea&s;t Di&s;pute, or Pretence of a Quarrel with the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> in &s;he pours with all her Fury upon the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> like an impetuous Torrent; plun|ders, burns, and never retreats without &s;ome con&s;i|derable Loppings which &s;he di&s;members from the Body of the Tree. Which neverthele&s;s is not a Mi&s;chief never to be remedy'd; &s;ince the Sea it &s;elf is many times re&s;train'd by Cau&s;eys and Mounds, though it be an Element a thou&s;and times more to be fear'd then the Policy and Pride of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. And this is that which the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the re&s;t of his Brave Confederates mu&s;t do, to &s;top and curb the rapid Inundations of <HI>France.</HI> They mu&s;t look upon the French Monarch as one that thun|ders in all his Forces and his Fury upon tho&s;e Places where he is &s;ure to find but little Re&s;i&s;tance, and
<PB N="62" REF="33"> from &s;uch Victories as tho&s;e he reaps his greate&s;t Honour. I confe&s;s, that a Prince who is violent, and a U&s;urper, is happy &s;o long as Fortune goes hand in hand with his Natural Humour. But in regard &s;he grows weary, for the mo&s;t part, of al|ways carrying one Man upon her Back, we al&s;o find that the &s;ame Prince becomes unpro&s;pe|rous, when Fortune changes her Mind, or ra|ther, when there is an Oppo&s;ition made again&s;t him.

<P>From the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> I cro&s;s over into <HI>England,</HI> where I find, that the Revolution which hap|pen'd in the Year 1689. affords a large Field, and ample Matter to &s;upply my Di&s;cour&s;e.

But certain it is that, <HI>France</HI> and He had long and pa&s;&s;ionately waited for the happy Minute; for that according to their Saying between 'em, <HI>Charles</HI> II. was a meer Slugg, and had neither vigour nor cou|rage to put in Execution the Projects that <HI>France</HI> was a Brewing. But far from that, <HI>Charles</HI> II. wanted
<PB N="63" REF="33"> neither Policy nor Ingenuity, and might have gone to his Grave with the Character of Prudent and Ver|tuous, but for his &s;candalous Inclinations for Women.

<P>The whole Policy and Craft of <HI>France</HI> is at a great Lo&s;s at this Conjuncture, to find that all her Machi|nations again&s;t the Life of the King of <HI>England,</HI> at pre&s;ent pro&s;perou&s;ly Reigning, are &s;till di&s;appoint|ed.

<PB N="67" REF="36"> the Court of <HI>France</HI> to find her &s;elf con&s;train'd to di&s;|mi&s;s this poor unfortunate Prince. But there will be no &s;uch Thing: For when Per&s;ons that have been profitable to the Court of <HI>France</HI> become once un|&s;erviceable, &s;he never &s;cruples to &s;end 'em packing in cold Blood. 'Tis true that &s;he ob&s;erves &s;ome Mea|&s;ures, and lets yee know her Mind at fir&s;t by Hints and indirect Whi&s;pers: but if you do not under&s;tand her Mute Language and Dumb Signs, &s;he fails not to inform your Stupidity with plain and down-right Expre&s;&s;ions: it being a Maxim of the <HI>French</HI> Court, never to love the Unfortunate. But you'l &s;ay, what Benefit can accrue to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. by keeping King <HI>James</HI> in <HI>France:</HI> 'tis not for the Benefit of his Coun&s;el; for he could never give or take any him|&s;elf; nor is it out of any heat of Concupi&s;cence for the Queen of <HI>England;</HI> for he has much hand&s;omer and Prettier in his Seraglio of St. <HI>Cyr,</HI> where Ma|dam <HI>de Maintenon</HI> out of her Pious Care, for &s;everal Years together has kept in good <HI>decorum</HI> a numerous Bevie of young hand&s;ome Ladies, who are as it were &s;o many Victims which &s;he offers to the Di|vinity of <HI>Lewis the Great;</HI> and though that Monarch had not that Re&s;erve for his little Plea&s;ures, the Court is full of <HI>Coquetts,</HI> and the Mothers are &s;uch <HI>Ninny-hammers</HI> as to carry their Daughters thither, to try whether or no their good Fortune will advance 'em to the Embraces of that Great Monarch, and all this in hopes to rai&s;e the drooping condition of their Fa|mily. In&s;omuch that I have known &s;ome Parents conde&s;cend to that point of Panderi&s;m, as to Le&s;&s;on their Daughters and in&s;truct 'em what they were to &s;ay and do, in ca&s;e the King &s;hould happen to take notice of 'em. So that mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, it would not
<PB N="68" REF="37"> be to Queen <HI>Jemmykin</HI> that the Sultan of <HI>France</HI> would throw his Handkerchief, unle&s;s it were with that Limi|tation that <HI>Alexander</HI> ob&s;erv'd, who refus'd to exerci&s;e at the Olympick Games, unle&s;s he might have Kings for his Competitors. And thus <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. grown more Great perhaps then formerly, would have the World believe, that he'll no longer be a Game&s;ter in the Sports of Love, unle&s;s he may have Queens for the Objects of his Pa&s;&s;ion. However, the King grows old, and therefore let us be &s;o favourable to him as to believe, that if the Court of <HI>France</HI> did entertain King <HI>James</HI> and all his Train at St. <HI>Germains,</HI> 'twas not for any Affection the <HI>French</HI> Monarch bare him, but becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fugitive who generally, feeds upon Chimera's, fancy'd Him&s;elf, and endeavour'd to per&s;wade the Court of <HI>France</HI> that he had a Great Party in <HI>England;</HI> not only all the <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> but all the Fanaticks in the Kingdom. That the <HI>Quaker Penn,</HI> who indeed is no other then a Je&s;uit in Ma&s;querade, a&s;&s;ur'd him of the Ab&s;olute Devotion of that whole Sect to his Party and Service. But the Court of <HI>France</HI> has been well inform'd, that all the&s;e A&s;&s;urances were meer Illu&s;ions, &s;eeing that neither Catholicks nor Quakers are admitted into the Par|liament, nor into any the meane&s;t Offices in the Kingdom; and that it would be a very difficult thing not to &s;ay an Impo&s;&s;ibility to embody all tho&s;e that go by the Name of <HI>Jacobites,</HI> &s;catter'd up and down in &s;everal Parts of the Kingdom, and for the mo&s;t part known to be &s;uch. Be&s;ides that, we find that no &s;ooner a Dozen of the&s;e Rebels meet together, but they are pre&s;ently di&s;cover'd; a vi&s;ible Sign of the Care that Divine Providence takes for the Pre&s;er|vation of their Brittanick Maje&s;ties; and that the

<P>There is no que&s;tion to be made but that the King of <HI>France,</HI> or his Council, is very well inform'd of the Con&s;titution of <HI>England,</HI> and that it will be in vain for their Enemies to attempt any thing there, &s;o long as the King and his Parliament are united together, as we find 'em at this Day. In&s;omuch, that this good Corre&s;pondence has furni&s;h'd the King with powerful Supplies, to oppo&s;e his Enemies both by Sea and Land, tho' their Number were double to what it is at this Day. For that &s;o long as the Eng|li&s;h have a formidable Fleet upon their Coa&s;ts, who &s;hall be &s;o daring as to attack 'em? Not <HI>France,</HI> I'm &s;ure. Be&s;ides, that if they can but come to grapple with their lurking Enemy, the French would &s;oon be con&s;train'd to quit their Coa&s;ts. So that all things being con&s;ider'd, there is nothing more for <HI>France</HI> to do, but to give over the War with <HI>England;</HI> for that unle&s;s they be Ma&s;ters of the Sea, their Trade is lo&s;t, and they are ab&s;olutely ru|in'd, not being able to &s;ell their Wines, their Bran|dies, and other Products of the Kingdom; be&s;ides that, they are forc'd to drein them&s;elves of all their ready Money to pay the King's Sub&s;idies; with a number of Impo&s;itions and Taxes with which the Kingdom &s;warms. And which is wor&s;t of all, their Harve&s;ts having fail'd for Two Years together, from whence &s;hall they have Corn if they be not Ma&s;ters of the Sea? more e&s;pecially being at War with the

So that 'tis no marvel that the French begin to be weary of the War, e&s;pecially with <HI>England;</HI> and that he no longer ob|&s;erves any Mea&s;ures with King <HI>James,</HI> who at pre|&s;ent re&s;embles one of one tho&s;e petty Saints, to whom they will not put them&s;elves to the trouble of light|ing up a &s;mall Wax Candle, becau&s;e they neither cure any Di&s;ea&s;es, nor are able to make their Guardi|an's Pot boil.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has begun a War, which &s;he will not get quit of when &s;he plea&s;es her &s;elf. Her Monarch has a long time acted <HI>Orlando Furio&s;o,</HI> and affronted both in Word and Deed, a Prince that was not in a Condition to defend him&s;elf; but now that Provi|dence&punc; by a miraculous Conduct, has plac'd the in|jur'd Prince upon the Britti&s;h Throhe, 'tis not for the Court of <HI>France</HI> to think, that God, by his Pro|vidence has &s;o highly exalted that Prince, has con|ferr'd upon him the Government of &s;everal King|doms and Provinces, and put &s;o great a Power into the Hands of the only Prince that <HI>France</HI> is afraid of; a Prince that has &s;o well united the greate&s;t part of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> in order to make a vigorous War again&s;t the common Enemy, who by degrees has &s;o largely u&s;urp'd upon their Domini|ons, and all this only to render more con&s;picuous the Honour of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. as his Emi&s;&s;aries give out. 'Tis never to be believ'd; and they that ima|gine it, mu&s;t be either void of Sence, or be of the Number of tho&s;e Phanaticks that have no more Wit then to adhere to King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>But if <HI>France</HI> can get nothing by a War with <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;he may be much a lo&s;er, con&s;idering the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="71" REF="38"> Condition of her Affairs.

At lea&s;t the Court of <HI>France</HI> is not to believe that the Eng|li&s;h will let 'em alone in the quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Dun|kirk;</HI> a Place that is no more the Patrimony of the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> then <HI>Strasburgh.</HI> They that &s;old both the one and the other of tho&s;e Cities, had no right to make the Bargain: <HI>France</HI> treated with tho&s;e that were under Age. Now we know that what an Infant Sells or Contracts for, is lyable to be cancell'd. <HI>Charles</HI> the Second had neither conquer'd nor pur|chas'd <HI>Dunkirk;</HI> he found it annex'd to the Crown upon his return to his Kingdoms; nor was it for him to &s;ell it, to &s;atisfie the Avarice of his Chancel|lor. So that the Kings his Predece&s;&s;ors, have &s;till an undeniable Right, either to regain it by Force of Arms, or recover it by Treaty of Peace, with much more Equity and Ju&s;tice, then the Chamber of <HI>Metz</HI> can pretend, to make Reunions to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The words <HI>&s;urrender back,</HI> are doubtle&s;s very hard of Dige&s;tion to <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, who pretends at all times to be the only Per&s;on that can re&s;tore Peace to <HI>Europe:</HI> and therefore he ought in the fir&s;t place to under&s;tand what Re&s;titution is.

The Race of <HI>Valois</HI> ended in <HI>France</HI> for le&s;s Crimes then tho&s;e that <HI>Bourbon</HI> has committed. But there is a preci&s;e Time appointed for humbling the Monarchs of the World, conceal'd from Humane Know|ledge, and it is a Folly to go about to penetrate in|to a Secret which Divine Providence has re&s;erv'd to it &s;elf. However we &s;ee the King of <HI>France</HI> tries all Ways and Means to Support him&s;elf, like a Man that &s;trives again&s;t Death. He ruins his Subjects to maintain his Armies; he Impoveri&s;hes 'em, to con&s;train 'em to turn Soldiers. He calls in all their Money, emba&s;es it, and pays 'em with New Money enhaunc'd above a Third part of the True Value, to fill his Coffers, He &s;eizes upon all the Church-Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and what belongs to private Per&s;ons, and coins it into Money; and the better to inveigle the People as it were to follow his Example, he &s;ends his own Plate Fir&s;t of all to the Mint, and &s;ends for it back the next day. There is not
<PB N="73" REF="39"> any Tax, or Toll, or Impo&s;ition that has e&s;cap'd the Invention of his <HI>Flint-Skinners;</HI> &s;o that the greate&s;t part of all the Handycraft Trade&s;men and Pea&s;ants have abandon'd their Farms and their Hou&s;es, to wander about and beg their Bread, or el&s;e to &s;eek their Livelihoods in foreign Countries.

The Court of <HI>France</HI> knows this to be true, and therefore takes &s;o much care to line their Coa&s;ts: tho' the King of <HI>France</HI>'s whole Army would not &s;uffice to guard a Compa&s;s of 300 Leagues in Extent &s;o well as they &s;hould do, to prevent the Enemies landing in &s;ome part or other: Where they that land have no more to do then only to &s;tand the Fir&s;t Shot; for the Se|cond Di&s;charge will prove very moderate; and for the Third, there will be no occa&s;ion to fear it.</P>
<P>I affirm then, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> alone are able to harra&s;s <HI>France</HI> more then any of the Confederates, to put her to an Exce&s;&s;ive Expence, which dreins her Trea&s;ury, forces the King to oppre&s;s his Sub|jects that he may repleni&s;h his Coffers, provokes the Malecontents to &s;hake off the Yoke of a De&s;potick Government, and to de&s;ire a Government like that of <HI>England,</HI> which beyond all contradiction is the mo&s;t Ju&s;t and mo&s;t Equitable, as well for the King, as for the People; every one there enjoying their

<P>If any one of the Republicks of <HI>Europe</HI> be able to infu&s;e Jealou&s;ies and Fears into <HI>France,</HI> it is the Republick of the United Provinces, which is at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t potent, the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious, the mo&s;t glorious, and the mo&s;t wealthy Republick in the World. I acknowledge that <HI>Venice</HI> may di&s;pute the Point of Antiquity with her: otherwi&s;e there is no Compari&s;on to be made between 'em.

And <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. at the Beginning of the War 1672. did ve|rily believe to have compa&s;s'd his De&s;igns: having invaded the States at a Time when they rely'd upon the Faith and Sincerity of Treaties, and had neither any Forces a foot, nor any General to lead 'em; Good Husbandry being Natural to Republicks in Time of Peace. Neverthele&s;s <HI>France</HI> could not &s;trike that Blow &s;o home as &s;he de&s;ir'd, without the Con|&s;ent of <HI>England;</HI> and therefore it was that the Court of <HI>France</HI> was &s;o careful to improve their Friend&s;hip with <HI>Charles</HI> II. &s;paring neither for Money nor the Allurements of Plea&s;ure to inveigle and fa&s;ten him to their Intere&s;ts, and to cau&s;e him to bury in Obli|vion all the Benefits he had receiv'd from the Re|publick and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange.</HI> Nor would <HI>France</HI>

<P>The Greate&s;t Policy of <HI>France</HI> was always to fo|ment Divi&s;ion between <HI>England</HI> and the United Provinces; afraid of nothing more then a good Corre&s;pondence and Union between the Two Pui&s;&s;ances. Nor did &s;he &s;ee any way more Probable to compa&s;s her Ends upon the United Provinces then by &s;ticking clo&s;e to <HI>England;</HI> which had fallen out luckily for her, during the two preceding Reigns while &s;he amus'd tho&s;e two Princes with Hopes of &s;haring in the Conque&s;t.

But in regard that frequently Revenge never con&s;iders the Danger to which it expo&s;es it &s;elf for the &s;atis|faction of its Rage, in like manner the King of <HI>France</HI> has drawn upon him&s;elf, all of a &s;udden, the the mo&s;t numerous, and the &s;ounde&s;t part of the Pu|i&s;&s;ances of <HI>Europe,</HI> who will never lay down their Arms till he has made tho&s;e Re&s;titutions, which they &s;hall think convenient for the Welfare of <HI>Europe;</HI> there being no other way of Reliance upon the Pro|mi&s;es and Faith of the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.</P>

<P>In the Year 1672. the United Provinces alone made Head again&s;t the Two Potent Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> were Victorious at Sea, and con&s;train'd the latter to make a Peace, and the other &s;u'd for the Peace of <HI>Nimeghen.</HI> Tho' through a remi&s;sne&s;s Injurious to the Honour of the Parties, the Plenipo|tentiaries, out of a Complyance not to be endur'd, &s;uffer'd the &s;lipping in of tho&s;e Words, <HI>That the King of</HI> France <HI>being de&s;irous to re&s;tore Peace to</HI> Europe, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereas it was he that begg'd for it, and made &s;uch Conde&s;centions to the City of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> that &s;he con&s;ented to it; &s;o that to &s;peak properly, 'twas &s;he, and not <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. that <HI>re&s;tored Peace to</HI> Europe. But in regard it was made without any great Precau|tions, and without taking any other Guarranty, then the Sincerity of a Prince who never had any, therefore it la&s;ted but a &s;hort while; and within the &s;pace of Six Years, the Peace-Re&s;torer committed &s;everal Ho&s;tilities, took many Cities and Fortre&s;&s;es, &s;o that there was need of a new Peace, and a Truce follow'd, to the end he might retain what he had u&s;urp'd: Nor were all the&s;e Treaties Mounds &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong to re&s;train the impetuous Torrent. He breaks through all the Tyes of Sanctity and Reli|gion, and falls upon <HI>Philipsburgh,</HI> the lo&s;s of which was attended with &s;everal other &s;curvy Inconveniences. Now upon what Foundation could the States of the United Provinces treat with a King that ob&s;erv'd no Rule of common Morality, but broke his Faith, his Word, his Promi&s;e, even with the Emperor him&s;elf. Certain barbarous People, whom <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> would have oblig'd to &s;wear Fidelity to him, re|turn'd him an&s;wer, That they never &s;wore any Oaths,
<PB N="81" REF="42"> but gave their Word, which they kept inviola|bly; from whence I ob&s;erve that they were not <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>The Mini&s;try of the Court of <HI>France</HI> imagines with it &s;elf, that <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. not having u&s;urp'd any thing upon the Republick of the United Pro|vinces, during the Peace, nor won any Place from her, during the War, that it would be always an ea&s;ie thing for their Monarch to make a Peace with her: be&s;ides that, the Hollanders are greatly inclin'd to Peace, by rea&s;on of their Trade, which is much ob&s;tructed in time of War; neither is it the Intere&s;t of a Republick, to enlarge her Confines, or to add new Provinces to tho&s;e &s;he has already, but to pre&s;erve Uni|ted what already &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and to &s;ecure her Frontiers the be&s;t &s;he can. But tho' <HI>France</HI> may be in the Right, as to &s;ome Circum&s;tan|ces, yet is &s;he deceiv'd in the main: For it is not &s;o ea&s;ie to make a Peace with the Hollanders, as the King of <HI>France</HI> imagines. Tho&s;e Peo|ple, tho' naturally good-natur'd and ea&s;ie, are not readily twice deluded. That Prudence which never for&s;akes the Coun&s;els of their Soveraigns, has &s;een, by the Con&s;equences of the Peace of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> that there is no tru&s;t|ing to <HI>France;</HI> but that all her Promi&s;es and Treaties were only meer Amu&s;ements, that is to &s;ay, a &s;ort of Recoiling to fetch the
<PB N="82" REF="43"> greater Leap: he mu&s;t be a very mean Politi|cian, and very dull-&s;ighted, who does not per|cieve, that <HI>France</HI> had a great mind to have made her &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of the United Provinces, their Wealth, and their Religion; tho&s;e three things &s;o precious and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the Inhabitants neither can nor ought to lo&s;e 'em, but with their Lives. And therefore as they ventur'd all to purcha&s;e tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o they will u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to pre&s;erve 'em, as the mo&s;t precious Jewels of the Re|publick. For the Hollanders are not like King <HI>James,</HI> who left the care of his Crown to the Count of <HI>Lau&s;une,</HI> while he ran away before the Battel of the <HI>Boyne,</HI> and before his Per&s;on was in any evident Danger.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> knows not as yet the &s;trength of the United Provinces, as being ignorant of what &s;he can do, if once &s;he be hard put to it: See|ing that if they could find the way, not only to &s;hake off the Chains of Servitude, but to make head for &s;everal Years again&s;t one of the mo&s;t Potent, and one of the greate&s;t Monarchs of <HI>Europe, Philip</HI> II. and come off with Ho|nour, why &s;hould the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France</HI> flat|ter them&s;elves under this Reign that they are able to de&s;troy 'em? 'Tis only becau&s;e Men are apt to flatter them&s;elves that they can compa&s;s what they de&s;ire; and generally they never
<PB N="83" REF="43"> care to be di&s;-abus'd, in regard that Hope &s;up|ports, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure, &s;atisfies an ambi|tious Mind. U&s;ually the Court of <HI>France</HI> is crowded with Flatterers, who make no other Prayers then for the Glory of their Monarch, and &s;ing no other Hymns then in his Prai&s;e; all their Opera's &s;ound forth the Grandeur and the Conque&s;ts of their new Deity, <HI>Jupiter-Bourbon.</HI> They per&s;wade him that he was &s;ent into the World to reign by him&s;elf, and to &s;ub|due all the People of the Earth under his Do|minion; they have given him the Sirname of <HI>Dieu-donn&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>God's Gift,</HI> and they make their Oblations to the immortal Man, <HI>Viro Immor|tali.</HI> To which purpo&s;e they have erected his Statue in the Piazza of <HI>Victory,</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> to the end that all his Subjects &s;hould pay the &s;ame Homages to his Figure as to his Per&s;on. Mar&s;hal <HI>de la Fueillade</HI> would needs pay it the fir&s;t Honours: For being a Collonel of the Foot-Regiment of Guards, he march'd his whole Regiment before the Idol, &s;aluted it with his Pike, and order'd all his Soldiers to &s;alute it with a Royal Volley; in&s;omuch that at fir&s;t there was no Body dur&s;t pa&s;s by it, without &s;ome kind of Genuflexion. And by that Sta|tue it is that Men may make a &s;hrew'd Con|jecture of the De&s;ign and good Intentions of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. &s;ince he had caus'd to be engrav'd upon the Pede&s;tal of the Idol, the Hollanders,
<PB N="84" REF="44"> as well as other Nations link'd and chain'd to|gether like Slaves under his Feet. By which 'tis ea&s;ie to di&s;cern, as in a Mirror, the very in&s;ide of <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. and his kind Intentions toward the United Provinces, in ca&s;e he could attain his Ends. And he di&s;cover'd his wicked Pur|po&s;es &s;o openly, after he thought him&s;elf a&s;|&s;ur'd of King <HI>James,</HI> upon his Elevation to the Throne by the ha&s;ten'd Death of <HI>Charles</HI> II. that 'twas the publick Di&s;cour&s;e in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> how they were going to fall upon the Hollanders, and that they would drown their Provinces under Water, to the end they might never ri&s;e again, to vex the King by their oppo&s;ing his ju&s;t De&s;igns. This was the common Language of the Court, and he that &s;hould have contradicted it, would have been Empal'd after the Turki&s;h manner. I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, that at pre&s;ent they &s;ee with other Eyes at the French Court, and their Language is quite another thing. 'Tis the main Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Court at this time to flatter and care&s;s the Hollanders, by that means if &s;he can to di&s;|burthen her &s;elf of a War too ponderous for a Kingdom groaning under Famine and many other Calamities; and which are more likely to encrea&s;e then abate. So that if the United Provinces, together with the re&s;t of the Con|&s;ederates, do but &s;tand their &s;tation, tho' they &s;hould gain no ground upon the Enemy, <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="44"> mu&s;t be forc'd to conde&s;cend to what Condi|tions they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;ay &s;ome of the more peaceful and qui|et &s;ort of People, what A&s;&s;urances have we of being able to con&s;train the King who makes Head again&s;t all the Confederates, to re&s;tore to <HI>Spain</HI> &s;o many Towns and Fortre&s;&s;es, and &s;o well fortifi'd, which he has in his Hands, to the end the Hollanders may enlarge their Bar|riers? I an&s;wer, That in this War the King of <HI>France</HI> is in an A&s;&s;ociation with the Turk, who by the Diver&s;ion he makes, cuts out Work for the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Forces of the Empe|ror and Empire: That the Ottoman Empire con&s;i&s;ts of a capricious and giddy-headed Peo|ple, who have been &s;everal times of late, and indeed upon all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Occa&s;ions defeated, and that by con&s;equence there is no|thing of certainty for <HI>France</HI> to tru&s;t to on that &s;ide, who only &s;ways the Port by the force of her Money, and a few frivolous Promi&s;es. So that there needs no more then an In&s;urrection of the People, or a humour of the Grand Sig|nior, the Prime Vi&s;ier, or the Mufti, to pro|duce a Treaty of Peace and overturn all the Hopes of <HI>France.</HI> Be&s;ides, that if we do but con&s;ider the Bottom of things, we &s;hall find that this War which the Turk continues with &s;o many Di&s;advantages, co&s;ts the French Year|ly
<PB N="86" REF="45"> tho&s;e Summs which they are unwilling to boa&s;t of. Secondly, <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. alone by him&s;elf, is bound to pay and maintain above Four hundred thou&s;and Men, to make head again&s;t his Enemies. Whereas the Confede|rates are not bound to keep &s;o many Men in con&s;tant Pay; for the &s;upply of which, every one bears his Proportion: nor does he that is mo&s;t burthen'd bear a Fourth part of the Load of <HI>France.</HI> 'Tis true, the Body of the Confe|derates is a bulky Fabrick, but it moves upon &s;everal Engines which makes it go the &s;urer. Now I dare maintain, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for the King of <HI>France,</HI> to act alone by him&s;elf, above Six Years, as he does, again&s;t a Confe|derated Body, without ruining his People. At the long-run, the Soldier turns the Citizen out of his Hou&s;e, and reduces him to beggary for want of Trade: The Taxes devour that little which the Inhabitants have heap'd up during the Peace. The Trea&s;ury fails be|cau&s;e the Springs are grown dry; the Mer|chant is ruin'd by his Lo&s;&s;es. The Cu&s;toms and Gabells, which were formerly the be&s;t and mo&s;t ready Money the King had, by rea&s;on of the great quantity of Salt that us'd to be utter'd all over the Kingdom, mu&s;t needs be very low, when People want Money to buy Bread more then Salt. And 'tis not long &s;ince that I heard one of the Farmers &s;ay, That the
<PB N="87" REF="45"> Gabells of Salt are fallen above half in half; and it is the &s;ame thing with all the other Farms in <HI>France.</HI> A Monarch without a full Exchequer, is like a Man without Hands and Eyes.</P>
<P>Of all the Soveraign Pui&s;&s;ances at pre&s;ent in Confederacy with <HI>France,</HI> there is not any one can contribute more to her Ruine, then the United Provinces, and that two ways: the one by preventing all Commerce and all man|ner of Trade with <HI>France,</HI> and forbidding un|der &s;evere Penalties the carrying of Provi&s;ion and Corn to the Enemies Country; in regard that Merchants are greedy of Gain, and care not whether they &s;upply Friends or Enemies: in&s;omuch that 'tis &s;aid of &s;ome People, to ex|pre&s;s their Extraordinary Thir&s;t after Profit, that if there were a Fair or Market in Hell, they would carry their Goods to the Infernal Gate, &s;o they might put 'em off. The Other way to Ruine <HI>France,</HI> is to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Sea, which they might ea&s;ily do in re&s;pect of the <HI>French,</HI> and by that means prevent any thing for going or coming out of the <HI>French</HI> Ports. Add to this, the Nece&s;&s;i|ty that <HI>France</HI> is in to &s;end for Hor&s;es into the United Provinces, to remount her Caval|ry, which it is in the Power of the States with ea&s;e to prevent.</P>
<PB N="88" REF="46">
<P>Be&s;ides all this, the United Provinces have had a va&s;t advantage over <HI>France</HI> during the Continuance of this War, by the Trade which &s;he has driven all along into the <HI>Indies, Italy, Turky, Spain, England,</HI> the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whereas the French have only <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Turky</HI> free to them&s;elves: for if they will have any thing from the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, they mu&s;t put up Swedi&s;h or Dani&s;h Colours to protect 'em from the Engli&s;h. On the other &s;ide, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that &s;everal Merchants Ships of both Nations fall into the Hands of the French Capers, and a far greater Number then tho&s;e that are taken either by Dutch or Engli&s;h. But then we mu&s;t con&s;ider that there are a hun|der'd Engli&s;h and Dutch Ships for one mi&s;erable French-man, continually trading upon the Sea; and many times our Capers meet with French Prizes that are hardly worth the Taking. Then again the Number of French Privateers &s;ur|pa&s;&s;es double and Treble the Number of the Dutch; in regard that the French Merchants having nothing el&s;e to do with their Ve&s;&s;els, turn 'em all into Privateers, that &s;o they may not lie idle. In&s;omuch that all the Ports of <HI>France</HI> are become Ne&s;ts of Pyrates and Sea-rovers only. Nor do we find all this while that their ill-gotten Purcha&s;es enrich either the Soveraign or the People. For according
<PB N="89" REF="46"> to the common Proverb, <HI>That which is got with the Flute is &s;pent with the Drum.</HI> And there|fore it is, that the Inhabitants of St. <HI>Malo</HI>'s and &s;ome other Ports of <HI>France</HI> are not a little trou|bled, that they have no better employment then to addict them&s;elves to Pyracy; but their Trade with <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> being quite ru|in'd for the pre&s;ent, they are con&s;train'd to turn Sea-rovers for their Sub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Now then we may a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves that 'tis &s;o far from being the Intere&s;t of <HI>France</HI> to ruine and de&s;troy the United Provinces, that 'tis the Study of all her mo&s;t &s;erious Policy to gain their Friend&s;hip, and inveigle 'em by fair Promi&s;es to accept a Peace, either &s;epa|rate or general, becau&s;e the Intercour&s;e be|tween the two States in times of Peace, brings more Profit to <HI>France</HI> then all the re&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI> be&s;ides. But this Peace is not to be obtain'd by <HI>France</HI> either from the United Provinces or from any other of the Confederates but upon &s;afe Conditions. For to &s;uch a <HI>Dilemma</HI> has the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King reduc'd him&s;elf, by begin|ning an Unju&s;t and Cruel War, neither pro|vok'd nor compell'd to it by any other Motives then tho&s;e of an Inordinate Ambition. So that it may be &s;aid of the Sun, which <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has made choice of for his <HI>Impre&s;s,</HI> that it re|&s;embles the Sun in <HI>March,</HI> which &s;tirs and
<PB N="90" REF="47"> rai&s;es the Humours of the Body, but has not Heat &s;ufficient to con&s;ume their Malignity.</P>
<P>To &s;ay Truth, <HI>France</HI> may be look'd upon as one of the wor&s;t Neighbours in the World: for &s;he lets no Prince alone that has the Mi&s;|fortune to lie near her. So that after <HI>Lor|raine,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Low-Countries and the Uni|ted Provinces had felt the Effects of her Fury, &s;he began again to pro&s;ecute her Old De&s;igns upon <HI>Savoy.</HI> And the Fir&s;t cour&s;e &s;he took to get footing in that Family, was by the means of &s;everal Matches with French Prin|ce&s;&s;es, to the End &s;he might have her Spies and Creatures in the very Beds of tho&s;e Prin|ces. For that is one of the mo&s;t Refin'd Pieces of French Policy for the King to make the Matches him&s;elf and to give 'em their Dowry, to engage 'em the more Cordially to his In|tere&s;ts. And at the &s;ame time he &s;ends 'em home to their New Spou&s;es, full of Great Idea's of the Monarch of <HI>France,</HI> and the va&s;t Obligations which they owe him, be&s;ides that before their Departure, he cau&s;es 'em to Swear upon the Holy Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>That for the future they &s;hall be ab&s;olutely devoted to</HI> France; <HI>that they &s;hall uphold the Intere&s;ts of that Crown at all Times and against all Per&s;ons whatever, in the Courts where they re&s;ide, and &s;hall inform either him or his Mini&s;ters of all that pa&s;&s;es in their Hu&s;bands
<PB N="91" REF="47"> Cabinets; and blindly obey the Orders that are &s;ent 'em by the King, or given by his Mini&s;ter re|&s;iding in the Court.</HI> And then there is no rea|&s;on to wonder at the Troubles which <HI>Hen|rietta Maria,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tina,</HI> the Daughters of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. marry'd by <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Savoy,</HI> occa&s;ion'd in tho&s;e Countries. The fir&s;t never cea&s;ing till by her ill Conduct and exa&s;perating her Husband to act contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom, &s;he had brought <HI>Charles</HI> I. to an Untimely End; and her go|ing into <HI>England</HI> may be &s;aid to be as it were the Source and Leaven of all the Misfortunes that en&s;u'd in our days.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>England,</HI> take a view of the greate&s;t part of all the other Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and you &s;hall find French Prince&s;&s;es who play their Parts with the Louidores of <HI>France.</HI> In <HI>Tu&s;|cany,</HI> we have &s;een the pre&s;ent Grand Duke, that he might procure his own Peace at home, &s;end a Bill of Divorce to the Grand Dutche&s;s, his Wife, (who is a Prince&s;s of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Orleance</HI>) and return her back to <HI>France,</HI> to undergo the &s;ame hard Fortune as <HI>Henrietta Maria,</HI> wa&s;ting the remainder of her Days in a mean Condition, depending upon the Incon|&s;tant Humour of the King of <HI>France.</HI> To whom &s;uch a return cannot choo&s;e but be a tacit Reproach of the Misfortune befallen her
<PB N="92" REF="48"> for upholding his Intere&s;ts: But in regard that Large Con&s;ciences are all the Mode of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> they can never be injur'd by Petty Stings or little Keckings. If you look upon <HI>Portugal,</HI> you &s;hall find there Mademoi|&s;elle <HI>d' Aumale</HI> marry'd to two Brothers one af|ter another, tho' the fir&s;t were alive at the time of the &s;econd Marriage. King <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> VI. &s;omewhat moro&s;e by nature, and not wil|ling to comply with the Coun&s;els and Care&s;&s;es of that Prince&s;s, the Court of <HI>France</HI> found a way to be rid of that Prince, who was ba|ni&s;h'd to the I&s;lands of <HI>Tercera,</HI> and his Mar|riage after di&s;&s;olv'd by the Duke of <HI>Mercoeur,</HI> the Queen's Uncle, made a Cardinal at the Sollicitation of <HI>France,</HI> and &s;ent Legate into <HI>Portugal</HI> with a de&s;ign to cut the Nuptial knot (a Secret all this while unknown to the Pope, who was ignorant of the Contrivances of the French Court) and tho' that during the Three fir&s;t Months of the Marriage it was given out that the Queen was with Child, yet they parted the Wedded Couple for all that, under pretence of Impotency, and marry'd her to <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> Succe&s;&s;our to the Crown and her Husband's Brother; and if <HI>Charles</HI> II. of <HI>Eng|land</HI> would have con&s;ented to a Divorce be|tween Him and Queen <HI>Katherine,</HI> the Court of <HI>France</HI> had de&s;ign'd him the Prince&s;s of <HI>Nevers.

<PB N="93" REF="48"> to her co&s;t, the fatal Con&s;equences of Matches with <HI>France:</HI> and his Royal Highne&s;s of <HI>Savoy</HI> at pre&s;ent ruling, had been within a Finger's breadth of lo&s;ing his Territories, had he pur&s;u'd his Journey into <HI>Portugal,</HI> to e&s;pou&s;e the Infanta, at the earne&s;t Sollicitation of the Prince&s;s his Mother who is a French Woman, and by the Per&s;wa&s;ion and Management of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> who were very Indu&s;tri|ous to procure that Match, on purpo&s;e to re|move the Duke out of his Dominions, and oblige him to &s;tay in <HI>Portugal</HI> in Hopes of a Crown, while <HI>France</HI> took the Opportunity to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>Piemont</HI> and <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has been a long time contriving and &s;tudying for a favourable Pretence to colour the the Execution of this De&s;ign. <HI>Harry</HI> the Great in his time agreed with the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> that upon his re&s;igning up to him all the Pre|ten&s;ions that the Duke had in <HI>Milanois,</HI> he &s;hould oblige him&s;elf to conquer it, and af|terwards exchange it for &s;uch Lands as the Duke held on this &s;ide the Mountains, which con&s;i&s;t in <HI>Genevois,</HI> all the Principality of <HI>Ni&s;&s;a,</HI> the County of <HI>Fou&s;&s;igni,</HI> and a part of <HI>Savoy</HI> as far as the <HI>Alps;</HI> to the end it might be in his Power to call him&s;elf Ma&s;ter from the <HI>Pyre|naeans</HI> to the <HI>Alps.</HI> But the Tragical End of <HI>Hen.</HI> IV. put a &s;top to that Enterprize. How|ever
<PB N="94" REF="49"> it did not quench the greedy Thir&s;t of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> which was rather en|creas'd then abated, as we have &s;een, by what was aim'd at by the Match with <HI>Portugal,</HI> which Heaven prevented by a Kind of Mi|racle, his Royal Highne&s;s having already taken leave of his E&s;tates.</P>
<P>The Court of <HI>France</HI> has always &s;o narrow|ly watch'd the Duke, that &s;he thought it im|po&s;&s;ible for him to e&s;cape her Trains, or to withdraw him&s;elf from the King's Plea&s;ure, who had &s;o near a Relation at the Court of <HI>Turin,</HI> that he had Intelligence of every thing which was acted there, and of every Petty Re&s;olution that was taken; and the main Bu|&s;ine&s;s was to hold the Duke under the King's <HI>Ferula;</HI> but above all, from holding any Cor|re&s;pondence with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> And for proof of the Truth of this, it may be remem|ber'd that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> could not go for his Diver&s;ion to <HI>Venice</HI> with his Electoral High|ne&s;s of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> but he was follow'd and watch'd by the Envoy of <HI>France,</HI> who was then at his Court, and who knew &s;o well to work and undermine with his Louidores, that he was inform'd of all that pa&s;t at that Inter|view. Which gave the Fir&s;t Occa&s;ion that Kindl'd the Fire of the War at pre&s;ent be|tween <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Savoy.</HI> And tho' there be
<PB N="95" REF="49"> a great Di&s;proportion between the two Con|tenders, neverthele&s;s the Duke gives no &s;mall di&s;turbance and trouble to the Court of <HI>France&punc;</HI> whether it be by the Alliances which the Duke has enter'd into, or by the Con&s;titution of the Italian Climate, which has always co&s;t <HI>France</HI> a world of Men, as having been always call'd the <HI>Church-yard</HI> for the French; and notwith|&s;tanding the inequality of Pui&s;&s;ance, the King has been con&s;train'd to keep up a numerous and chargeable Army on that &s;ide, to which he is oblig'd to &s;end, at va&s;t Expences out of the <HI>Dauphinate</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> his Ammuni|tion and Provi&s;ion, for their Sub&s;i&s;tance. More|over <HI>France</HI> never imagin'd that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> could or dur&s;t have undertaken any thing again&s;t her. For which rea&s;on the Po|licy of <HI>France</HI> ne'er thought it worth while to fortifie her Frontiers on that &s;ide, to prevent in time of War the <HI>Savoyards</HI> from entring into <HI>Provence</HI> and the <HI>Dauphinate.</HI> Nor was ever the King more &s;urpriz'd, or madder, then when he heard that the Confederates had got footing in tho&s;e two Provinces. So that had it not been for the Accident that befell his Royal Highne&s;s, and the unhappy Con&s;e|quences of his confiding too much in the Je|&s;uits of <HI>Ambrune,</HI> which was in part the Cau&s;e of the Return of his Army, certain it is that the Duke had enter'd Victorious into <HI>Grenoble.</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="50"> The Dread of his March reach'd not only to <HI>Lion,</HI> but as far as <HI>Paris.</HI> A good part of the Inhabitants of the <HI>Dauphinate</HI> and <HI>Provence</HI> had already quitted their Country, but the Great|e&s;t part impatiently waited for the Conqueror's coming to deliver them out of their Mi&s;ery, and break their Chains: but they were fru|&s;trated in their Hopes for the Rea&s;ons above mention'd. The Court of <HI>France</HI> always flat|ter'd her &s;elf till now, that if &s;he re&s;tor'd to the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> &s;ome Town that &s;he had taken from him, that he would be glad to re|new his Alliance with her: Nay, &s;he believ'd it an Honour which he would &s;ue for; but &s;he found her &s;elf deceiv'd. For &s;he met with a Haughty and undaunted Prince, who would not li&s;ten to any Propo&s;als that tended to di&s;|unite him from his Confederates: and be&s;ides, knowing <HI>France</HI> too well, his Royal Highne&s;s was ab&s;olutely convinc'd, that there was no relying upon the Promi&s;es and Word of a King, much le&s;s upon the Faith of his Mini&s;ters, who glory in deceiving tho&s;e with whom they have to deal, if any Benefit redounds from thence to <HI>France.</HI> The Court of <HI>France</HI> had her Aim and her Pro&s;pects in her Offers which &s;he made la&s;t to the Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and it was the Strife of her Policy to bring him off from the Confederates, and to have render'd him liable to their Ill Opinion; who would doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="97" REF="50"> have abandon'd him, and thereby have left <HI>France</HI> at her Liberty to have invaded his Country. For &s;hould <HI>France</HI> re&s;ign to the Duke all the Places &s;he had taken from him, but keep <HI>Pignerol</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> in his Hands, that were &s;till no more then lying always between the Ham|mer and the Anvil. His Royal Highne&s;s there|fore having drawn his Sword again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> that continually oppre&s;s'd him, it behoves him never to &s;heath it again, till he has pro|cur'd his full Freedom, and &s;ecur'd him&s;elf from future Dangers, &s;eeing he may well ex|pect to be &s;incerely &s;uccour'd by the Confe|derates, who never will for&s;ake him, but al|ways &s;tick by him as hitherto they have done. So much the rather, becau&s;e they may be able in ca&s;e the Catholick King dyes without I&s;&s;ue, to &s;eat him in a better Station, to which he has already Great Preten&s;ions by the Marriage of <HI>Charles Emanuel,</HI> in the Year 1561. with <HI>Ka|therine,</HI> Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Philip</HI> II. So that by the Addition of <HI>Piemont</HI> to <HI>Milanois,</HI> he may take upon him the Name and Title of King of <HI>Lombardy:</HI> Which is an Advantage he can never attain to, if he de|part from the Intere&s;ts of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> to embrace the Promi&s;es of <HI>France,</HI> which early or late will deceive him.</P>
<P>'Tis never to be thought that <HI>France</HI> will
<PB N="98" REF="51"> ever mend, or that &s;he will act for the future with more Fidelity then hitherto &s;he has done. To tru&s;t to her, would be for a Man to put a willing Cheat upon him&s;elf. The Black|moor can never change his Skin, nor the Leo|pard alter his Spots: So <HI>France</HI> can never help her U&s;urping upon her Neighbours: Am|bition is an inveterate Di&s;ea&s;e that has &s;eiz'd her, never to be Cured, but by the Pro&s;pe|rity of the Confederates. I know very well that they flatter his Highne&s;s with a Match between the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> (the Dauphin's Elde&s;t Son, and who in his Turn may wear the Diadem of <HI>France</HI>) with one of the Young Prince&s;&s;es of <HI>Savoy:</HI> but this is &s;till to ca&s;t Oyl into the Fire, and give <HI>France</HI> a New Handle to lay hold on, who is ready enough to gra&s;p all Advantages without giving her an Oppor|tunity. The&s;e are Baits, which the Emi&s;&s;aries of <HI>France</HI> throw about at a venture, to try whether they will take or no. If not, how|ever it fails not to make &s;ome Impre&s;&s;ion in the Brea&s;ts of the Ladies, who being Members of the Frail Sex, ea&s;ily fall into the Snare, and willingly feed them&s;elves with worldly Ho|nours, never con&s;idering what they will co&s;t 'em, nor the Dangers that attend 'em.</P>
<P>The Antipathy between the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> whether it proceeds from any Hatred

And this has been his Care all along during this War, which began in 1672. at what time <HI>Sweden</HI> declar'd openly for <HI>France.</HI> Tho' he repented of it afterwards; whether it were by rea&s;on of his Ill Succe&s;s and the Advantage of the Electour of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> during that War, or the Infidelity of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> &s;o far from ob&s;erving her Word, that &s;he never pay'd the Money which &s;he promis'd to that Crown, but on the other &s;ide depriv'd the Northern Prince of his Dutchy of <HI>Deux Ponts.</HI> Which ill U&s;age lo&s;t the French all their Credit in the Court of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where they were afterwards look'd upon as Cheats: in&s;omuch that the Good Cor|re&s;pondence formerly between tho&s;e two Na|tions turn'd into Hatred and Scorn. After this Change, in regard the Policy of <HI>France</HI> found it Convenient to have one of the&s;e two Northern Princes tack'd to her Intere&s;ts, &s;he ca&s;t her Affection upon <HI>Danemark,</HI> and &s;o well ply'd the Mini&s;ters of that Court with her Louidores, that now &s;he governs 'em as &s;he
<PB N="100" REF="52"> Plea&s;es, and makes 'em daunce to the French Ayres. I mu&s;t acknowledge that the King of <HI>France</HI> pays the Violins, but &s;till <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. has the Plea&s;ure to &s;ee the <HI>Danes</HI> dance and foot it to his advantage. The Siege of <HI>Rat|z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nburgh</HI> co&s;t <HI>France</HI> Three hunder'd Thou|&s;and Crowns, which were pay'd at <HI>Hambo|rough,</HI> upon throwing the Fir&s;t Bomb into that Fortre&s;s. For the Policy of the Court of <HI>France</HI> would needs venture that Summ at a time when &s;he had little rea&s;on to have &s;par'd it, in hopes that this Siege would have made a notable Diver&s;ion, and that all the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Luneburg</HI> would have recall'd all their Forces from the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> and the <HI>Rhine,</HI> to defend that Place. But here the French were cully'd by the Danes. For the Difference was made up between both Parties, <HI>France</HI> not being able to prevent the Reconciliation, which &s;eem'd to her, to have been Impo&s;&s;ible. But this is not the Fir&s;t Attempt of the Court of <HI>France</HI> that has come to no|thing: So that it cannot be &s;aid that &s;he takes her mea&s;ures &s;o truly as never to be mi&s;taken; as her Emi&s;&s;aries give out with high applau&s;e. For to hear them Chatter, a man would &s;wear that the Re&s;olves of the Cabinet of their Great Monarch were the Decrees of Heaven that never err; which <HI>France</HI> does often and more frequently then &s;he would her &s;elf.</P>
<PB N="101" REF="52">

<P>The Emba&s;&s;adour of <HI>France</HI> has made choice of <HI>Soleurre</HI> for the Place of his Abode, becau&s;e the Inhabitants of that Canton are all zealous Roman Catholicks; who pin their Faith with great Submi&s;&s;ion upon the Sinceri|ty of their Curate: and the Emba&s;&s;adour re|&s;ides here, to &s;hew the Particular Honour which his Ma&s;ter has for the Roman Catho|lick Cantons, above the Evangelick, and that the Monks and Prie&s;ts may have free Acce&s;s to him, who bear a great Sway among the Catholicks.

<P>There is no que&s;tion, but that among the Switzers, among whom there are &s;ome who have travell'd and &s;een the World, there are to be found &s;everal Per&s;ons &s;ufficiently quick-&s;ighted &amp; Politick, and &s;uch as under&s;tand how Things are carry'd. 'Tis not long &s;ince a Dif|ference happen'd in the Canton of <HI>Glaris,</HI> which <HI>France</HI> fir&s;t kindl'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">mented to the ut|mo&s;t of her Power; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Innocent</HI> the XI. quick|ly &s;tifl'd it, by his Wi&s;dom and Piety.</P>
<P>I am convinc'd that tho&s;e Per&s;ons are deep|ly &s;en&s;ible of the Affronts which <HI>France</HI> puts upon 'em from time to time, and with what Scorn &s;he treats their Emba&s;&s;adours, the la&s;t of which, were forc'd to return without being able to procure Audience of the King, after &s;edulous Applications to <HI>Colbert Croi&s;y,</HI> Se|cretary of State for the Foreign Affairs. But the more prudent &s;ort of Switzers, you'll &s;ay, would fain have the Lyon chain'd, and his Claws par'd before they fall upon him. To which I An&s;wer, That the Switzers may con|tribute very much toward the Chaining of the Lyon, as furious as he &s;eems to be, and yet not openly declare them&s;elves neither; by de|manding the di&s;mantling of <HI>Huninghen,</HI> and for want of &s;o doing, by recalling their Men out of <HI>France,</HI> which compo&s;e the greate&s;t part of the French Infantry, and are the only
<PB N="124" REF="64"> Combatants well &s;econded by the Cavalry, upon which the French depend for all their Succe&s;s. The King of <HI>France</HI> is now Con|vinc'd of the Value of the Switzers, and &s;o has been, ever &s;ince <HI>Louvois</HI>'s Mini&s;try. Formerly they were not well belov'd at Court, nay, they were contemn'd; but &s;ince the Altera|tion of the Face of Affairs, they are at pre&s;ent con&s;ider'd, for the Benefit which <HI>France</HI> receives from 'em, like Twins that are ty'd together, and mu&s;t dye together. I mu&s;t confe&s;s that the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Swi&s;s Regiments is worth &s;ome Money to that Na|tion, and di&s;charges the Country of abundance of idle lazy People: but I'll maintain it, that the French Service is the Plague and De&s;tru|ction of va&s;t numbers of Young Men of Good Prote&s;tant Families that ruine them&s;elves by the Debaucheries of Wine and Women, which always terminates in a Revolt again&s;t their Religion and their Country. Which would never happen, if they &s;erv'd the Prote&s;tant Princes. The Court of <HI>France</HI> knows well that &s;he cannot fa&s;ten an Officer of Quality to her Intere&s;ts with a &s;tronger Tye, &s;o as to make him ab&s;olutely forget his own Country, then by the Change of his Religion. And therefore &s;he Labours underhand by means of the Women and Monks; and tho&s;e Snares take Effect with the greate&s;t part that are at|tack'd

There they are bred, and there they dye, to make room for other New Commers, who are Tempted thither like Young Pigeons with the &s;mell of Roa&s;ted Dogs.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has had no place from whence to &s;upply her &s;elf during this War, but the Swi&s;s Cantons: Some Seamen &s;he may get indeed from the North: but for Land-Soldiers, of nece&s;&s;ity it behoves her to care&s;s and embrace the Hel|vetian Body, without who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance the French would never be able to bring &s;uch Nu|merous Armies into the Field: And the Swit|zers are the Only Per&s;ons upon which the King of <HI>France</HI> may depend, &s;o long as he keeps his Word with 'em, and that he pays 'em what he contracts for, and what he promi&s;es. Nor
<PB N="126" REF="65"> will they &s;tand to the Lo&s;&s;es of his enhauncing and re-inhauncing his Money.

For the Switzers are thrifty Husbands, and &s;end a good part of their Pay to their Parents in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> where there is no Variation of the Coin admitted.</P>
<P>Now it being &s;o certain, as I have already &s;aid, that <HI>France</HI> &s;tands in need of the Switzers in this Conjuncture, this is the rea&s;on that the French Emba&s;&s;adour re&s;iding in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> has Orders not to di&s;gu&s;t 'em, nor give 'em the lea&s;t Subject of Complaint, but in every Canton to care&s;s all tho&s;e in particular who have the be&s;t Intere&s;t, and carry the greate&s;t Sway&punc; on purpo&s;e to prevent 'em from entring into a more &s;trict Alliance with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the States of the United Provinces. For which rea&s;on it was that the French Mini&s;ter us'd all his Power and Intere&s;t to &s;top the Levies which M. <HI>Cox,</HI> the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI>'s Envoy would have rais'd not long ago. But if the Bu|&s;ine&s;s did not then &s;ucceed, <HI>France</HI> is beholding for it to the want of Management in tho&s;e that under&s;tood not the right knack of dealing
<PB N="127" REF="65"> with the <HI>Switzers,</HI> &s;eeing afterwards others found the way to di&s;cover the forward Incli|nations of that Nation toward the Confede|rates, by the Levies that were made under|hand, which is a terrible Blow to <HI>France,</HI> in regard that tho&s;e new Regiments draw away a Great Number of their fellow Country-men out of the French Service, e&s;pecially the <HI>Pro|te&s;tants.</HI> However, we do not find that <HI>France</HI> dares to make any great noi&s;e about it, moderating and re&s;training her Pa&s;&s;ion, till a more propitious Opportunity: but in regard the Cantons on the other &s;ide may be a&s;&s;ur'd that &s;he Barrels it up, and that if at pre&s;ent they e&s;cape Scot-free, yet whenever it lies in her Power, <HI>France</HI> will never forget &s;uch heinous Provocations; therefore 'tis now the Swit|zers Intere&s;ts to labour with the re&s;t, the hum|bling <HI>France,</HI> now the Confederates are fol|lowing her &s;o clo&s;e at the Heels. For the Lower <HI>France</HI> is brought, the more the French will care&s;s the Switzers, and &s;eek their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance; whereas in their Pro&s;perity they &s;light and domineer over 'em, and would utterly &s;ubdue 'em, were it in the Power of the Court of <HI>France,</HI> that re&s;embles Fire or the Sea, which never will acknowledge they have e|nough.

<P>Tho' the <HI>Turks</HI> are People both Barbarous and altogether Infidels, neverthele&s;s they ob|&s;erve this Maxim, never to abandon tho&s;e that put them&s;elves under their Protection, and to keep their Words and Promi&s;es; and this is one of the Points of their Law. And there|fore it is, that they acknowledge that all the Misfortunes and Lo&s;&s;es which they have &s;u|&s;tain'd during this War, have proceeded from their Breach of Faith and Truce. And this it was which &s;purr'd 'em on about two Years ago to &s;end their Envoys to <HI>Vienna,</HI> with Offers of Peace to the Emperour. Which hotly ala|rum'd the Court of <HI>France;</HI> but &s;he, being Subtle and Crafty, took an Occa&s;ion to in&s;inu|ate into the <HI>Turks,</HI> That they might continue the War without any Scruple of Con&s;cience, &s;ee|ing they had offer'd Peace to the Emperour, that he had refus'd it, and continu'd his Ho|&s;tilities again&s;t them; That now the <HI>Turks</HI> who

And yet all the World knows how earne&s;tly the Mini&s;ters of <HI>France</HI> &s;ollicit the Confederates to make a Peace without mentioning the <HI>Turk</HI> in the lea&s;t: and it was an Argument of the French at <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;pur up

But when the&s;e Projects of <HI>France</HI> were made known at the Ottoman Court, and that the Grand Vi&s;ier upbraided the Em|ba&s;&s;our with 'em, he appeas'd the Prime Mini|&s;ter by telling him, That what the Court of <HI>France</HI> had done in re&s;pect to that Affair, was only to deceive his Enemies, and to amu&s;e 'em with Frivolous Offers, on purpo&s;e to put a &s;top to their Preparations again&s;t the next Cam|paign, and to make the People the more un|willing to contribute toward the War.

<PB N="132" REF="68"> This Prote&s;tation is to be met with in the Sixth Article of the Renunciation of the King of <HI>France</HI> belonging to the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty in the Year 1660.

Nor was it then a difficult thing to per&s;uade 'em that their Misfortunes were at an end, that Heaven was now going to puni&s;h the Empe|rour for refu&s;ing the Peace which they had offer'd him; and that to &s;econd this happy beginning, the King his Ma&s;ter or the Dau|phin (who was call'd the <HI>Young Sultan</HI> at the Port) would come in Per&s;on with a numerous Army; and make a Con&s;iderable Diver&s;ion up|on the <HI>Rhine.</HI> But in regard the Turks have never yet &s;een any Effects of the&s;e Mighty Pro|mi&s;es, the French Emba&s;&s;adour is forc'd from time to time, to bear the Brunt of mo&s;t bloody Reproaches from the Lips of the Grand Vi&s;ier, and to endure many a rugged Storm without going to Sea.

<PB N="134" REF="69"> Fury be abated; and then with new Pre&s;ents he makes fre&s;h Promi&s;es, and like the Chil|dren, promi&s;es to do better next time. A &s;ad Conjuncture for a Monarch, who believes him|&s;elf to be the fir&s;t and greate&s;t in the World, and ranks him&s;elf like <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon</HI> and <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> in the Number of the Gods, to be forc'd to &s;uch mean Submi&s;&s;ions, and to &s;uffer continual Affronts and Reproa|ches from an Infidel, to pre&s;erve the Friend&s;hip and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Turks. But this is now the Depth of the Policy of <HI>France,</HI> rather to Cringe and Creep, and become a kind of Tri|butary to the Ottoman Port, then to make Re|&s;titution of what he has u&s;urp'd from the <HI>Chri|stians:</HI> rather to allow Liberty of Con&s;cience to the <HI>Turks</HI> then to the <HI>Huguenots.</HI> And this I have been a&s;&s;ur'd, that <HI>Chasteauneuf,</HI> the French Emba&s;&s;adour, not knowing one day which way to appea&s;e the Grand Vi&s;ier, offer'd him that Liberty in his Ma&s;ters Name, and that he &s;hould give leave to the <HI>Turks</HI> to erect Mo&s;|quees at <HI>Tholoun</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> The &s;ame Offers have al&s;o been made to the Governour of <HI>Algiers</HI> in any place of <HI>Bretaigne</HI> that he &s;hould make choice of, provided he would &s;end his Men of War into St. <HI>George</HI>'s Channel to rob the Engli&s;h and Hollanders. And if the&s;e Offers did not take Effect, 'twas becau&s;e the Grand Signior &s;tood in need of the <HI>Algerines</HI> to &s;erve again&s;t the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and re-inforce
<PB N="135" REF="69"> his Fleet in the <HI>Levant.</HI> Neverthele&s;s, the&s;e Offers fail'd not to work with the Grand Mufti, who like the Romi&s;h Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, loves the Propagation of his Faith and the Free Exerci&s;e of his Religion; and who being &s;wee|ten'd up withall, by &s;ome Con&s;iderable Pre&s;ent openly declar'd for the French <HI>Sultan.</HI> But as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive as <HI>France</HI> is yet a while to her Ally, that &s;he may pre&s;erve his Friend&s;hip, you &s;hall &s;ee that he will leave him in the Lurch, and deliver him up a Prey to the Emperour, &s;o &s;oon as he can find a way to make Peace with the Confederates. And then that Sepa|ration would infallibly beget a War between the two Sultans, were the <HI>Turk</HI> in a condition to revenge him&s;elf. However his want of Strength to commence a War will not hinder him from loading the French Merchants that re&s;ide in his Dominions with Terrible Oppre&s;|&s;ions; and &s;o the poor Merchants mu&s;t pay for the Infidelity of their Monarch. But the Court of <HI>France</HI> never troubles her Head about That, provided &s;he can but compa&s;s her own Ends. And for the Obtaining of tho&s;e, &s;he will never Spare for the Blood or E&s;tates of her own Sub|jects, nor did &s;he ever value the Lives and Li|berties of &s;o many poor <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> as have been &s;acrific'd during this War with the <HI>Turk,</HI> to the Ambition of <HI>Lewis the Great.</HI></P>
<P>But we are now a&s;cending if we can, to the Pinacle of French Policy, &s;o high that few or
<PB N="136" REF="70"> none can reach it; that is to &s;ay, the Depopu|lation of <HI>France,</HI> and con&s;equently the Ruine of the Kingdom for Religion's &s;ake. For it is well known that the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have always made a Con&s;iderable Body of that Realm, and tho' they have been Per&s;ecuted and Ma&s;&s;acred under divers Reigns, more-e&s;pecial|ly in the Reigns of <HI>Charles</HI> IX. and <HI>Henry</HI> III. neverthele&s;s they have &s;till reviv'd again and con&s;iderably encreas'd their Number; yet al|ways faithfully devoted to the Service of their Soveraign: and that Fidelity obtain'd all tho&s;e Edicts of Pacification and Liberty of Con&s;ci|ennce, which were granted 'em by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. For as the Hi&s;torians them|&s;elves confe&s;s, the <HI>Huguenots</HI> were the Men that fix'd the Crowns upon the Heads of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and his Off&s;pring <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. now Reigning, who&s;e Crown, when he was Young and in his Minority, the Fir&s;t Prince of the Blood would have wre&s;ted from him, pre|tending that the Succe&s;&s;ion belong'd to him by Right of Birth after the Death of <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII. openly a&s;&s;erting his Claim as well by word of Mouth as publick Manife&s;to's, at the Time of the <HI>Pari&s;ian Bar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">cado's.</HI> Nor could the King him&s;elf forbear to give Truth her due, in &s;eve|ral Declarations and Edicts, and by Letters written to the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Princes. And indeed &s;o Signal a Piece of Service, and a Devotion &s;o faithful to the Per&s;on of this Monarch gave the
<PB N="137" REF="70"> <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> all the Encouragement in the World to hope for an Irrevocable Protection, and an Enlarg|ment of their Liberties &amp; A&s;&s;urance of Safety both for them&s;elves and their Po&s;terity, not only during the Reign of this King, but al&s;o of his Succe&s;&s;ours. Neverthele&s;s, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Signal Ser|vices, they only obtain'd the Title of <HI>Faithful Sub|jects,</HI> which the King affected to be&s;tow upon 'em in all his Edicts and Declarations. Nay their Fi|delity was &s;o di&s;&s;erviceable to 'em as to create no|thing but Fears and Jealou&s;ies in the Prime Mini|&s;ters and Courtiers; and augmented the Natural Hatred of the Je&s;uits, who all together from that time forward meditated nothing more then to a|ba&s;e and ruine the Prote&s;tant Party, and in&s;pir'd into the Young Prince di&s;tru&s;tful Sentiments of tho&s;e to whom he was beholding for his Crown; per&s;wading him, that if the <HI>Huguenots</HI> were &s;o powerful as to &s;ettle him in his Throne, they would be able at another time to throw him down again whenever he refus'd 'em any Privilege which they demanded. The&s;e Di&s;turbers of the Repo&s;e of <HI>France</HI> having thus found the Monarch di&s;pos'd and inclin'd to follow their pernicious Coun&s;els, the Je&s;uits, Directors of the Prince's Con&s;cience, fail'd not to improve tho&s;e Sentiments &s;o Oppo&s;ite to his Real Intere&s;ts and his Promis'd Faith; and for the Expiation of &s;ome Great Sin, impos'd upon him, by way of doing Pennance, the cancelling &s;ome Privileges granted to the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> by the King his Predece&s;&s;ours, and with an Oath confirm'd by
<PB N="138" REF="71"> the Reigning Prince. And as it is u&s;ual for Scorn to degenerate into Hatred, the King having lay'd a De&s;ign to ruin the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> thought it then high time to begin with the De&s;truction of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of his Kingdom. And then it was that every Body &s;tudy'd who &s;hould be mo&s;t for|ward to &s;econd the Bloody De&s;ign of their Sove|raign, and to invent new Torments for the more quick di&s;patch of the <HI>Great Work,</HI> as the Court of <HI>France</HI> call'd it: and the King him&s;elf could not refrain him&s;elf from &s;aying, That he would have the &s;atisfaction, in his Life-time, of having the Ho|nour to de&s;troy Here&s;ie, and that he had rather leave the Dauphin a Beggarly, then Heretical King|dom; and thus enflam'd, Men, Women, Children, Monks and Mini&s;ters of State, all cry'd out, <HI>To the Sack, to the Sack with the Churches of the</HI> Hugue|nots; and every one according to his Power lent a willing hand to the Diabolical Work. Madam <HI>de Maintenon,</HI> an Old Female Sinner, was the Je|&s;uits faithful and &s;edulous &s;he-Intelligencer, who for that purpo&s;e held their Cabals both day and night: the Marquis of <HI>Louvois</HI> &s;ent away the Dra|goons into the Provinces, and St. <HI>Ruth</HI> put in Ex|ecution with great delight the Cruel Orders that were di&s;patch'd from Court, and recommended to his Executioners and Hangmen the Care of tor|menting the poor Creatures with all &s;orts of Bar|bari&s;m and Cruelty. And while this Tragedy was acting in the &s;everal Provinces, the Chan|cellor <HI>Tellier,</HI> &s;ent forth Declaration upon Declara|tion
<PB N="139" REF="71"> again&s;t the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> and i&s;&s;u'd out the Re|vocation of all their Edicts, Privileges and Liber|ties, with &s;o much Satisfaction, that as he was &s;ea|ling the Revocation of the Edict of <HI>Nants,</HI> he could not forbear declaring, <HI>That it was the great|e&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that ever overjoy'd him in his Life, and that he could be content, after he had &s;een that happy Day, to dye;</HI> and he was &s;o impious as upon that Bloody occa&s;ion to repeat the Song of <HI>Simeon:</HI> and indeed God took him at his word: for within a few days after he deliver'd <HI>France</HI> from that &s;ame Mon&s;ter of Men. However the Per&s;ecuti|on did not cea&s;e with the Life of that Mini&s;ter, who left very good Di&s;ciples behind him: for that Father <HI>La Chai&s;e,</HI> finding one day the King in a Good Humour, obtain'd an Order from him for a General Ma&s;&s;acre of the <HI>Huguenots</HI> all over <HI>France,</HI> grounding his Per&s;ua&s;ions upon the Con&s;tancy of &s;ome of 'em, with whom the Pri&s;ons and Con|vents were cramm'd; and upon the Hypocri&s;ie of the New Converts, who when Opportunity &s;er|ved, would be as &s;o many Enemies within the Kingdom, and that therefore there wanted a little Blood-letting to cure the Mi&s;chief. And if this Order were not put in Execution, the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> were beholding to the Two Fir&s;t Princes of the Blood, <HI>Cond&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Cont&iacute;,</HI> who took it out of Father <HI>La Chai&s;e</HI>'s Hands, and return'd it to the King. This Per&s;ecution, which produc'd nothing but Hypocrites and forc'd Catholicks, con&s;train'd a va&s;t number of People to quit <HI>France,</HI> and retire
<PB N="140" REF="72"> with their Effects into Foreign Countries, contrary to the Expectation of the Court, and the Policy of the King and his Mini&s;ters, who never intended to di&s;people the King|dom, as the Spaniards did their Country, by expelling the Moors: and for fear of falling into the &s;ame Blunder again, they committed another as bad: &s;etting forth Ri|gorous Prohibitions, forbidding all People to &s;tir out of the Kingdom, guarding the Pa&s;&s;es and ordering all to be brought back Pri&s;oners that &s;hould be taken upon the Frontiers, and filling the Pri&s;ons, Convents and Galleys with their Captives, which was very near the &s;ame thing as expelling 'em the Kingdom.</P>
<P>All this &s;o barbarous and unheard-of U&s;age was pre|meditated, however, notwith&s;tanding the outward &s;hew of Piety, to be &s;erviceable to the King's De&s;ign, as having been for &s;ome Years contriving the Utter Ruin of the <HI>Prote&s;tants:</HI> and therefore rightly judging that the Po|tentates their Confederates would never con&s;ent to their De&s;truction, in regard their Downfall would only &s;erve to aggrandize <HI>France,</HI> and augment her Strength in order to the carrying the whole Univer&s;e before Her; there|fore the Policy of the Court of <HI>France</HI> very &s;illily believ'd that the Per&s;ecution of the <HI>Huguenots</HI> would draw all the <HI>Catholicks</HI> into her Snares which &s;he had thus baited with her Pretended Zeal. But the &s;ame <HI>Catholicks</HI> being more di&s;creet and wary, and well acquainted with the Tricks and Fine&s;&s;es of <HI>France</HI> compar'd the French Zeal to Crocodiles Tears, that weep to drill Pa&s;&s;engers with|in their reach, and then darting them&s;elves upon their Prey, &s;eize and devour it. Nay, the Pope him&s;elf &s;melt out the Cheat, and did all that lay in his Power to oppo&s;e it; as was apparently &s;een by the Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Fur&s;tenberg.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' the Event has &s;hew'd us that <HI>France</HI> was mi&s;ta|ken in her Calculation, yet &s;he &s;till goes on with her Pro&s;ecutions of the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> tho' le&s;s at one time then another, in regard that 'tis the be&s;t way for Princes to
<PB N="141" REF="72"> go through with Follies begun, and for that the King's meaning was to make all <HI>Europe</HI> believe, that he had no other End then to make Pro&s;elytes, and to propagate the Catholick Religion, which is a thing that mo&s;t prudent and moderate Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Religion could never perceive by what is pa&s;t, nor di&s;cover in any Pro&s;pect of Futurity. Nor has the King of <HI>France</HI> procur'd the lea&s;t Advantage to the Roman Church by his Oppre&s;&s;i|ons within his Kingdom, or by his per&s;uading and in|veigling the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to per&s;ecute the <HI>Vaudois</HI> with the &s;ame Severity; quite contrary to the Sentiments of <HI>In|nocent</HI> XI. who openly di&s;approv'd Violence in Matters of Religion, and who could not forbear &s;aying, That at the &s;ame time that the French Emba&s;&s;adour made Bon|fires at <HI>Rome,</HI> and rejoyc'd for the De&s;truction of the French <HI>Huguenots,</HI> That his Heart bled Tears of Blood: fore&s;eeing that all tho&s;e Forc'd Conver&s;ions would one day prove extreamly Prejudicial to the Church: and that the King of <HI>France</HI> did but di&s;poil him&s;elf of the Lovely Robe of Primitive Charity, to put on the Old Rags of Pagani&s;m, dy'd with the Blood of &s;o many Martyrs.</P>
<P>Moreover the&s;e abominable Proceedings of <HI>France</HI> have only &s;erv'd to render the <HI>Catholicks</HI> &s;u&s;pected to the <HI>Pro|te&s;tants,</HI> and to beget a Scorn and Hatred of 'em in Pla|ces where before they liv'd together in Brotherly Love and good Corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>But what is more Con&s;iderable, and for which <HI>Rome</HI> and all the <HI>Catholicks</HI> will have ju&s;t Rea&s;on eternally to reproach <HI>France,</HI> and complain of her Monarch <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. is this, That he preferr'd the Advance|ment of <HI>Mahometi&s;m</HI> before the Support and Pre&s;erva|tion of the <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion in <HI>England,</HI> quite ruin'd by the Dethroning of King <HI>James,</HI> whom he for&s;ook in his Greate&s;t Nece&s;&s;ity; more-e&s;pecially &s;eeing that unfor|tunate Prince had never fallen into &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n Aby&s;s of Mi|&s;ery, had he not follow'd the Pernicious Coun&s;els of
<PB N="142" REF="73"> his Confederate who incens'd him to per&s;ecute his Sub|jects in <HI>England,</HI> as he had done his own in <HI>France;</HI> and to alter the Religion and Laws of his Realm, to &s;erve the Intere&s;ts and De&s;igns of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>But the Engli&s;h, more Prudent and Circum&s;pect then the French, fore&s;eeing the Tempe&s;t that began to gather already over their Heads; and of which the Con&s;e|quences could not but produce a Shipwrack, like to that which had &s;wallow'd up the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> &s;eeing that the Dragoons began already to cro&s;s over out of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> where there was a Father <HI>Peters</HI> ani|mated with the &s;ame prepo&s;terous Zeal as Father <HI>La Chai&s;e;</HI> and a Chancellor <HI>Jefferies</HI> no le&s;s wicked and bloody then <HI>Tellier</HI> or <HI>Louvois;</HI> the Engli&s;h, I &s;ay, be|holding the Scaffolds erected, and the Fires ju&s;t ready to be kindl'd, withdrew them&s;elves in time from the Yoke that <HI>France</HI> was preparing for their Necks; and by that Re&s;olution for ever da&s;h'd the vain-glorious Hopes of all the Engli&s;h Catholicks.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the King of <HI>France</HI> has great Rea&s;on to repent of Two Things; his Per&s;ecution of the <HI>Protestants</HI> of his Kingdom, and his la&s;t Siege of <HI>Philipsburgh.</HI> For that tho&s;e two Things were the Original Cau&s;e of the War, and the Ba&s;is of all the Calamities with which <HI>France</HI> is at pre&s;ent overwhelm'd; and which daily augment beyond any Help or Remedy, which all the Policy of that Court, all the Wiles, the Artifices and Knavery of her Mini&s;ters, and all the Bigotry of her Male and Female Hypocrites can apply to &s;top their &s;preading, or prevent the &s;ame De&s;tiny from befalling the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great as befell <HI>Antiochus,</HI> &s;irnam'd <HI>Epiphanes</HI> or, <HI>The Illu&s;trious:</HI> there being &s;o great a Uniformity in their Manner of Acting, the Beginning and Progre&s;s of their Atchievements, that we have great Rea&s;on to hope, that their <HI>Exits</HI> will be the &s;ame.</P>
