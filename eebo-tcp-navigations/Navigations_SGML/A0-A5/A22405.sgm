<HEAD>&leaf; By the King. &para; A Proclamation for the better furni&s;hing of the Nauy, and increa&s;e of Shipping.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_WHereas the &s;mall allowance of Pay to the Sailers</HI> &s;eruing in the Kings Shippes, is ob&s;erued to be a chiefe occa|&s;ion why the &s;aid Shippes haue not beene, nor could bee &s;o &s;pee|dily and &s;o well Manned as is requi&s;ite, both for His Maie&s;ties &s;eruice, and the good of the State, e&s;pecially in the&s;e times, when they are to be imployed for the repre&s;&s;ing and pur&s;uing of forreine enemies, infe&s;ting the Coa&s;ts, and endammaging His Maie&s;ties Subiects, as al&s;o in regard of other important &s;eruices, Which being propounded by the Lord Admirall to the re&s;t of the Lords of His Maie&s;ties Priuie Coun&s;ell at the Board, and it being mooued by his Lord&s;hip, that with their approbation His Maie&s;tie might bee mooued, that the <HI>Medium</HI> of allowance for euery Sayler might be Twentie &s;hillings a Moneth, where|as now it is but fourteene &s;hillings, By which meanes there will accrue to euery ordinary man Fourteene &s;hillings a Moneth, be&s;ides an allowance out of it, of foure pence to a Prea|cher, two pence to a Barber, and &s;ixe pence a Moneth to the Che&s;t, whereas the ordinary men haue now but Nine &s;hillings foure pence a Moneth, and no allowance at all giuen to a Prea|cher, Out of the &s;urplu&s;age of which proportion now mooued to be increa&s;ed, all Officers wages would be likewi&s;e re&s;pectiuely rai&s;ed, and allowance al&s;o might be giuen for a Lieuete|nant and a Corporall. Which motion &s;o made by the Lord Admirall, the re&s;t of the Lords hauing taken into their &s;erious con&s;ideration, and well weighed both the proportion and the rea&s;ons whereupon it was grounded, did thinke it very fit that His Maie&s;tie &s;hould be mooued therein, to the end His Maie&s;tie might bee plea&s;ed to Command that the &s;ame might be accor|dingly put in execution.</P>
<PB REF="2">
<P>And His Maie&s;tie, being thereupon mooued by the Lords of His Priuie Coun&s;ell, out of His gracious di&s;po&s;ition to encourage the poore Saylers cheerefully, and faithfully to &s;erue Him, Hath beene well plea&s;ed to enlarge the Entertainement, and Allowance heeretofore gi|uen to the Saylers; And doeth hereby publi&s;h and declare, and doeth al&s;o promi&s;e and vn|dertake, That from hencefoorth euery Sayler, which &s;hall be imployed in any of His Ma|ie&s;ties Ships, &s;hall haue &s;uch allowance made, and duely payd vnto him, as was propounded by the Lord Admirall, as afore&s;ayd. And His Maie&s;tie, by the like aduice of His Priuie Coun&s;ell, doth &s;traitly charge and command, That no Merchants, or Owners of Ships, &s;hall draw away any Saylers, by enhaun&s;ing of their pay, le&s;t thereby His Maie&s;ties Ser|uice, and the Seruice of the Publique, doe &s;uffer preiudice: Neuerthele&s;&s;e, His Maie&s;tie is very well contented, That they who trade into very remote Countreyes, as into <HI>Mu&s;couia,</HI> and more particularly, they of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, (who cannot alwayes furni&s;h their Shippes with men at ordinary Rates, for Voyages of that length and danger) may haue libertie to v&s;e meanes for the accommodating of them&s;elues in that behalfe, in the be&s;t manner they can.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, whereas in the time of the reigne of the late Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous me|morie, for the better encouraging of the Ship-ma&s;ters, and Merchants, to build Ships, there was an Order made, for the allowance of Fiue Shillings a Tunne to euery Ship aboue the burthen of one hundred Tunnes, which &s;hould afterwards be built: Which Order was vp|on the &s;ame rea&s;on reuiued by His late Maie&s;tie of euer ble&s;&s;ed memorie, King <HI>Iames;</HI> His Ma|ie&s;tie being de&s;irous to giue all encouragement, for the encrea&s;ing of the number and &s;trength of the Shippes of this Kingdome, by the like aduice of His Priuie Coun&s;ell, Is well plea&s;ed, and doeth hereby publi&s;h and declare, and doeth promi&s;e and vndertake, That His Maie&s;tie, for and vnto euery Ship, which &s;hall from hencefoorth bee built, of the burthen of two hun|dred Tunnes or vpwards, &s;hall and will giue, and duely pay an allowance of Fiue Shillings for euery Tunne.</P>
