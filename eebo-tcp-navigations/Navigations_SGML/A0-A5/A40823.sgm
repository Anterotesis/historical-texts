<P>_WEll met, Myn Heer <HI>Hans,</HI> my old acquaintance; but why &s;o &s;ad, I pray thee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hans.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yonker <HI>George</HI> I am heartily glad to meet with &s;o good a friend, to whom I may &s;afely impart my thoughts and di&s;|cover the ground of my &s;adne&s;s. I pray let me give you a gla&s;s of wine, that we may have but one half hours di&s;cour&s;e together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, <HI>Hans;</HI> and I &s;hall give you another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you, <HI>George,</HI> Coming lately out of <HI>Holland,</HI> I have been much amazed to &s;ee here
<PB N="4" REF="3">&s;o great animo&s;ities, and preparations for war again&s;t my Countrey-men, who are your bre|thren, of the &s;ame Reformed Religion, and there|fore ought (as I ever judged) to be clo&s;ely Leagued together again&s;t our common Enemies, who, like &s;o many Lions, watch for an opportuni|ty to devour us both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Hans,</HI> it is the Intere&s;t of every Na|tion, to fortifie them&s;elves again&s;t their Enemies: but what if we cannot perceive a greater and more dangerous Enemy to our Nation, then your Countrey-men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope, <HI>George,</HI> you will never be able to make that appear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Hans,</HI> that hath &s;ufficiently appeared to all under&s;tanding men above the&s;e fifty years; and I have oft heard old States-men &s;ay long ago, That by our great a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and too long fa|vouring the <HI>Hollander</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> we &s;hould breed up a Serpent in our bo&s;ome, that at length might devour us, and that the <HI>Hollander</HI> would be one day &s;uch a Thorn in our &s;ides, that would hardly ever be plucked out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good <HI>George,</HI> what were tho&s;e great favours and a&s;&s;i&s;tances that we have received from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for I am not old enough to remember, nor am I much conver&s;ant in Hi&s;tory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will then reckon up to you &s;ome of them. Fir&s;t, whil&s;t you were all Heathens, one <HI>Willibrod,</HI> a holy zealous <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> by his great pains, and hazard of his life, fir&s;t planted the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y">Religion among&s;t you. Long after, when you were all overwhelmed with the Super&s;titions of <HI>Rome,</HI> and began to de&s;ire a Reformation, and for that were &s;orely per&s;ecuted by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Inqui|&s;ition, in&s;omuch that five thou&s;and families left their hou&s;es, and fled out of the Countrey; this our Nation received mo&s;t of them, appointed Churches for them, and allowed them many no|ble priviledges here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e indeed were great Civilities, and we ought never to forget them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, <HI>Hans,</HI> do not interrupt me, for I can reckon divers more, and tho&s;e very con&s;iderable. In the year 1585. when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> pre&s;&s;ed your Countrey very &s;ore on every &s;ide, that you began to be in a mo&s;t de&s;perate condition, <HI>England</HI> took pity upon them, took them into protection, &s;ent over to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance 5000 Foot, and 1000 Hor&s;e, lent them great &s;ums of money, obtained great aids for them from the then Prince Elector Palatine, removed the great Staple of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth from <HI>Antwerp</HI> to <HI>Delft</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> which oc|ca&s;ioned the great wealth, and many fair Build|ings there to be &s;een at this day. Then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> protected your Countrey-men in their Navigation and Trade, gave them particular Licen&s;es to Fi&s;h in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas, and encouraged them every where abroad, whil&s;t the Flower of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nobility and Gentry, &s;pent their bloud, and lo&s;t their lives in your Countrey at home, in defence thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e indeed were very &s;ignal favours, and and we &s;hould be the mo&s;t unworthy wretches in the world, if we &s;hould not for ever acknow|ledge them upon all occa&s;ions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Hans,</HI> you &s;hall &s;ee anon how they were requited: but I have not yet done with the kindne&s;&s;es multiplied by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> upon the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>When the enraged <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;aw, that by the valour and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> his Forces and Moneys were mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sfully wa&s;ted and con&s;umed, he &s;ent fifty thou&s;and old Souldiers out of his other Dominions into <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> to devour the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at once: Hereup|on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ent over an&s;werable Forces, with Moneys to maintain them; for they maintained at one time, as credible Authors report, fourty thou|&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot there, in the &s;ervice of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> in&s;omuch that not long after, when we perceived plainly that you thrived and grew rich by the War, and we grew poorer every day; about the latter end of Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign we began to think of withdrawing of our Forces, and demand the &s;ums of Money which the <HI>Hollander</HI> had borrowed, with promi&s;e of paiment thereof to us in due time, which was in all above twenty hundred thou&s;and pounds Sterling, a Debt we find not ever yet di&s;charged: be&s;ides which mighty Sum, it was computed before the coming in of King <HI>James,</HI> that we had &s;pent upon them in &s;etting forth Fleets, and other Charges
<PB N="7" REF="4" MS="y">for your &s;akes, above one Million of money, and lo&s;t in that Service there above one hundred thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h-mens</HI> lives. King <HI>James</HI> after|ward con&s;idering the Premi&s;&s;es, refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them any longer: and not long after, ob&s;erving how in&s;olent the <HI>Hollander</HI> was grown, he i&s;&s;ued out a Proclamation, wherein His Maje&s;ty de|clared, That &s;ince His Maje&s;ties great Indulgence had given occa&s;ion to His Neighbours, to en|croach upon His Regalities, to que&s;tion His Right, to wrong and injure daily His Subjects in their Trade of Fi&s;hing, &s;o as they were con&s;train|ed to abandon that Trade, whereby it came to pa&s;s, that divers of His Sea-towns were depopu|lated and decayed, the number of Sea-men daily dimini&s;hed, which was of high con&s;equence and importance to this Nation, con&s;idering how much the &s;trength, and wealth, and &s;ecurity thereof con&s;i&s;teth in the power of Shipping, and u&s;e of Navigation: Therefore that his expre&s;s plea&s;ure was, That no Foreigner, of what Nation &s;oever, &s;hould be permitted to Fi&s;h upon any of the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and any of the I&s;les adjacent, without expre&s;s leave fir&s;t obtained of His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, your Countrey-men in a &s;hort time after grew &s;o haughty and in&s;o|lent, as not onely to continue their encroach|ments on our Coa&s;ts, but at length to conte&s;t with that peaceable King, and down-right to claim a Right to what they demanded, and though His
<PB N="8" REF="5">Maje&s;ty did then, by His Commi&s;&s;ioners and Am|ba&s;&s;adors, conde&s;cend to debate that antient Right of <HI>England</HI> with them, and conjure them not any longer to provoke him by infringing His Rights, which He and all His Ance&s;tors had ever enjoyed without the lea&s;t interruption: Yet did your Countrey-men abu&s;e His great patience by artificial delays, pretences, &s;hifts, dilatory ad|dre&s;&s;es and eva&s;ive an&s;wers. And though they were at length brought to acknowledge the Do|minion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas to be the Right of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> yet then confiding in their greatly encrea&s;ed Strength at Sea, they &s;oon after invaded this Prerogative with more in&s;olence then before, as may be &s;een in the printed Letters which pa&s;&s;ed between Secretary <HI>Naunton</HI> then at <HI>White-hall,</HI> and Sir <HI>Dudley Carlton,</HI> then that Kings Amba&s;&s;ador at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>George,</HI> if the&s;e things were &s;o, it is a wonder, that King did not then break out into an open War with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>He had certainly rea&s;on enough &s;o to do, when I have told you that which I had almo&s;t for|got. When the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had fir&s;t &s;etled a Trade in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> for &s;ome years, and &s;etled divers Factories there, they did not refu&s;e to permit your Countrey-men to Trade by them as much as they plea&s;ed. But tho&s;e wretched people en|crea&s;ing in wealth, and at length perceiving their &s;trength to be greater there then ours, they for|got all former Kindne&s;&s;es and Friend&s;hips, and
<PB N="9" REF="5" MS="y">began not onely to undermine us treacherou&s;ly and wickedly to &s;upplant us in our Trade there, but al&s;o utterly to exclude us out of tho&s;e parts: and to that end in the year 1622. mo&s;t barbarou|&s;ly &s;ei&s;ed upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factories and Goods, to the value of 400000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, tortured and murthered many of them in a more cruel and horrible manner, then ever <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or the <HI>Spani&s;h Inqui&s;ition</HI> ever treated tho&s;e they called <HI>Hereticks:</HI> which Inhumanity of theirs was &s;o mon&s;trous, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> to this very day are infamous for the &s;ame among the rude and &s;avage <HI>Indians:</HI> And King <HI>James</HI> being truly informed thereof, told your Amba&s;&s;adour at <HI>London,</HI> that he had never read nor heard of a more cruel im|pious fact; but being a man of peace, he declared, that he did forgive them; but added with a kind of Prophetick &s;pirit, <HI>[My Son's Son will revenge this bloud, and puni&s;h this horrible ma&s;&s;acre.]</HI> Since all this, during the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr, your Countrey-men have committed many other enormities and cruelties upon the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who endeavoured onely to continue a &s;mall Trade there, and have endamaged particu|lar Merchants of <HI>England</HI> many hundred thou&s;and pounds, and by engro&s;&s;ing all the be&s;t Spices, and &s;elling them at their own rate, they daily im|poveri&s;h, not onely our Merchants, but this whole Kingdom, from whence they draw yearly for tho&s;e Commodities above 400000 <HI>l.</HI> one main rea&s;on of the great want of Silver and Gold in <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="6">
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>George,</HI> I cannot any longer deny but that we are much to be blamed: yet I am confident, that all this hath not &s;o much proceed|ed out of any ill-will to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as out of too much Love of gain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may po&s;&s;ibly be true in part, for it hath been ob&s;erved particularly of your Nation above others, that when Gain comes in compe|tition, they do forgo not onely all Honour and Hone&s;ty, but even all Religion too. But to pro|ceed. When King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t had &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, how his good Subjects were u&s;ed by your Countrey-men, in all parts of the World where they had power, and how bold the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> were in His Seas, Rivers, and Ports, His Maje&s;ty thought it high time to &s;et him&s;elf to curb their in&s;olency, and to put a &s;top to their mo&s;t prodigious growth, and to this end took care to &s;trengthen His Kingdom in Shipping, and to declare by Proclamation, That perceiving that all the Inconveniencies which had occa&s;ioned the forementioned Proclamation of His Royal Fa|ther, were rather increa&s;ed then abated, His Ma|je&s;ty did re&s;olve thence-forward to have in rea|dine&s;s &s;uch a power of Shipping, as might be &s;uf|ficient to hinder the like encroachments upon His Regalities, (and thereupon began to build that famous Ve&s;&s;el, called &s;ince <HI>The Royal Sove|reign,</HI> and &s;ome other Ships of War; for which good End, and honourable De&s;ign, he was forced by the refractorine&s;s of a Faction in His Parlia|ments,
<PB N="11" REF="6" MS="y">to lay the Tax called <HI>Ship-money.</HI>) And be|cau&s;e His Maje&s;ty &s;aw, that tho&s;e extraordinary preparations did occa&s;ion many jealou&s;ies and di&s;cour&s;es abroad, he declared farther by a pub|lick Writing, That fir&s;t, he held it a principle not to be denied, That the King of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was a Monarch at Land and at Sea, to the full extent of His Dominions; and that it concerned Him as much to maintain His Sovereignty abroad, in all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas, as at home within His Three Kingdoms, becau&s;e without That, The&s;e could not be kept &s;afe, nor He pre&s;erve His Honour and Re&s;pect with other Nations. Secondly, he held, That who&s;oever would endeavour to encroach on His Maje&s;ty by Sea, would doubtle&s;s do it al&s;o by Land, when ever they &s;hall find opportunity. To avoid which, after long abu&s;ed patience, His Maje&s;ty &s;aw no other hopes, then by maintaining always a powerful Navy. Thirdly, it was very notorious, how of latter years His Maje&s;ties Domi|nion at Sea hath been di&s;obeyed and que&s;tioned. That at fir&s;t to cheri&s;h the poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Dutch,</HI> leave was given them to gather &s;trength and wealth upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts, in the&s;e Ports, and by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade and People: That upon their humble Petitions, Licen&s;es were given them un|der the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> to Fi&s;h upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts; and when by leave or connivance they had for &s;ome time Fi&s;hed upon all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Staple of Woollen Clothes brought from the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h
<PB N="12" REF="7">Netherlands,</HI> and &s;etled in their Towns, they arrived to an extraordinary power in Shipping, they refu&s;ed at fir&s;t to be kept at any di&s;tance from the&s;e Coa&s;ts: After that, they began to keep Ship-guards on the&s;e Seas, to prohibit even the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to have free Commerce there, to &s;eize on their Ships and Goods, if they refu&s;ed to con|form to their Placaets; to interrupt the Trade and Traffick of the&s;e Seas by Ships of War and Free-booters, to pre&s;ume at all times to enter in|to all His Maje&s;ties Ports and Rivers, to come up as high as the Chief City, to ca&s;t Anchor clo&s;e to our Magazines, to contemn His Maje&s;ties Offi|cers when they required a farther di&s;tance, to a&s;&s;ault and take the Ships of His Maje&s;ties Allies, even within His own Chamber or Channel, and within his Rivers, to the &s;corn and contempt of His Maje&s;ties Dominion and Power. That this their ordinary practi&s;es, His Maje&s;ty having in vain endeavoured for divers years, by Treaties, to reform, he thought it high time to put him&s;elf in this Equipage, both for His own defence and &s;afety, for pre&s;erving His antient and undoubted Right in the Dominion of the&s;e Seas; to &s;uffer no other Prince or Potentate to encroach upon His Regalities, but to con&s;train them to perform due Homage to His Admirals and Ships, to pay them Acknowledgments as in former times they all had done; to &s;et open the&s;e Seas, and therein to protect a free Trade of all His Subjects, and al&s;o of all His Allies, and to give them &s;uch &s;afe
<PB N="13" REF="7" MS="y">Conduct and Convoy, as they &s;hall rea&s;onably require: To &s;uffer no Fleets or Ships of War of other Nations, to keep any Guards upon the&s;e Seas, to take any Prizes or Booties, to offer any violence, or give any interruption to any lawful intercour&s;e. In a word, That His Maje&s;ty was re&s;olved to do Ju&s;tice, both to His Subjects and Friends, within the Limits of the&s;e Seas; and that this was the Real and Royal De&s;ign of that Fleet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, <HI>George,</HI> that King was a very good Man, and would not declare publickly any untruth; if &s;o, then he had great rea&s;on to make &s;uch extraordinary Preparations: but I do not re|member what became thereof.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not long after began tho&s;e unhappy Re|bellions, fir&s;t in <HI>Scotland,</HI> then in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and la&s;tly in <HI>England,</HI> which gave a long check to our happine&s;s, and to this de&s;ign. And in the mean time your Countrey-men very cunningly, bought up much of our be&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Oak, (which for Shipping is the be&s;t in the world) cut down by our wicked Rebels, and &s;old to you at very low Rates; and you then encrea&s;ed &s;o prodigiou&s;ly in Naval power, that even tho&s;e Rebels began at length to &s;ee, that the main and principal Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> was to &s;top the growth of the <HI>Hol|lander;</HI> and therefore took occa&s;ion in the year 1652. to make a rupture, and to pro&s;ecute it &s;o far, that they had almo&s;t done their work: But that De&s;ign was then broken in the mid&s;t by <HI>Oliver
<PB N="14" REF="8">Cromwel,</HI> who di&s;&s;olving the remainder of the long factious Parliament, and u&s;urping all the power of the Nation, thought it his own private Intere&s;t for a good &s;um of Money to clap up a peace with your Countrey-men, at a juncture of time, when it lay in his power in all humane pro|bability, to have done the highe&s;t piece of &s;er|vice for this Nation that could po&s;&s;ibly have been effected, (except onely the Re&s;toration of our pre&s;ent Sovereign, whom God long pre&s;erve) for he might then have humbled your Nation to that degree, that they &s;hould have been glad of the Protection of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o from thence|forward have lived in great Amity and Peace to|gether; and not onely our Trade would for ever have flouri&s;hed, but thereby had been prevented the va&s;t Expences of Trea&s;ure and Bloud, which our two la&s;t Wars have &s;ince occa&s;ioned, to the great Impoveri&s;hment and Damage of this King|dom.</P>
<P>But to go on. Within two or three years after that fir&s;t rupture with your Countrey-men, they having &s;et them&s;elves to build new Ships, and increa&s;e their Naval &s;trength, began again to &s;upplant the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade in &s;everal parts, and re&s;olving to fright them quite out of that &s;mall Trade the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> retained in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> the <HI>Hollander</HI> grew &s;o in&s;olent, as not onely to pro|hibit the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> all Trade at <HI>Bantam,</HI> where they had a Factory, but &s;eizing on their Ships and Goods, mo&s;t cruelly and barbarou&s;ly treated the
<PB N="15" REF="8" MS="y">Sea-men, torturing &s;ome, and murdering others: for which, to prevent another rupture, the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> were content to pay to our <HI>Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-India</HI> Merchants 50000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, in the year 1658. at <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> About two years after, you know was the mo&s;t happy Re&s;tauration of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, who having received at the <HI>Hague</HI> divers re&s;pects and civilities for &s;everal days, before he took Shipping for <HI>England,</HI> was afterwards very unwilling to break Friend&s;hip with them, till their In&s;olencies and Injuries cried &s;o loud for vengeance, (as may be &s;een in the Memorials pre&s;ented by His Maje&s;ties Envoy to the <HI>States General</HI> at the <HI>Hague</HI>) that there was no other Expedient left but another Rupture, which happened in the year 1665. when the <HI>Dutch</HI> were grown much more powerful at Sea (by the addition of many new-built mighty Ships) then they were in the former Rupture, and much more unanimous at home: yet we had then, e&s;pecially after the fir&s;t Fight, good rea&s;on to hope, that we &s;hould have not onely abated the pride, and &s;topt the growth of your Countrey|men, but al&s;o have weakened and humbled them, &s;o far as that they &s;hould never have ri&s;en up again to be a Thorn in our &s;ides. But their time was not yet come, their &s;ins were not then ripe; and therefore it plea&s;ed the Sovereign Di&s;po&s;er of all things, by a mo&s;t &s;ore Pe&s;tilence, and a ve|ry di&s;mal Fire, at that time to put a &s;top to our Victories and Succe&s;&s;es. Whereupon a Peace was
<PB N="16" REF="9">concluded at <HI>Breda,</HI> in the year 1667. Since which, they have built &s;o many, and &s;o great new Ships of War, that confiding in their exorbitant power, they have not onely ventured again to &s;upplant our Trade, (the want whereof cau&s;eth &s;o great murmuring in <HI>England</HI>) but al&s;o to break all the Articles of the <HI>Breda</HI> Treaty, and utterly deny His Maje&s;ties Sovereignty over the&s;e Seas, and to threaten us to joyn with the <HI>French,</HI> to in|vade our Countrey, and &s;wallow us up for ever. Whereupon His Maje&s;ty, having fir&s;t made &s;ure of His Allies abroad, and carefully provided at a mo&s;t va&s;t expence, not onely &s;uch a formidable Fleet, &s;uch great Stores of Ammunition, &s;uch a num|ber of brave Seamen, but al&s;o &s;uch a Full Trea&s;ury, as none of His Ance&s;tors ever were Ma&s;ters of, thought him&s;elf obliged again to declare War again&s;t the <HI>&V;nited Netherlands,</HI> this pre&s;ent year 1672. not onely to cha&s;tize them for their breach of Faith and Articles, and for their mo&s;t &s;can|dalous Libels, in&s;olent and unmannerly Pictures, Ver&s;es, and Repre&s;entations of our King and Princes. (which &s;hould make the bloud of every loyal, true-hearted, well-born <HI>Engli&s;h-man</HI> even to ri&s;e again&s;t them) but al&s;o to e&s;tabli&s;h and aug|ment our Trade both at home and abroad; and above all, to maintain the Antient Sovereign Right and Dominion over the Narrow Seas, which is one of the fir&s;t Prerogatives of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Kings, and &s;hould be the la&s;t wherewith they &s;hould ever part; for without that, what ad|vantage
<PB N="17" REF="9" MS="y">will it be for <HI>England</HI> to be an I&s;land? and how will it be more &s;ecure from Inva&s;ions, then any. Countrey upon the Continent? and how ea&s;ily would our Trade and Traffick be ta|ken from us? Wherefore con&s;idering that the Sovereignty of the Seas is the mo&s;t precious Jewel in His Maje&s;ties Crown, that to touch that is to touch the Apple of <HI>England</HI>'s Eye; that it is next, under God, the principal means of our wealth and &s;afety; and that it hath lately mo&s;t injuriou&s;ly been invaded by the <HI>Dutch;</HI> all true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hearts and Hands &s;eem to &s;tand obliged by all lawful ways and means to pre|&s;erve and maintain the &s;ame, with the utmo&s;t hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, with a cheerful Expence of their Bloud and their Mo|ney, with a re&s;olution never to lay down Arms, until they have accompli&s;hed this great and good Work.</P>

<P>Under the Ro&s;e be it &s;poken, your King will then tyranize over you more then he doth now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, <HI>Hans,</HI> that may ea&s;ily be done; for no King, Prince, or Potentate in the world doth tyrannize le&s;s then he doth, or ever hath done &s;ince he came to this Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>What means then this Bleating of Sheep
<PB N="18" REF="10">in mine ears, and this Lowing of Oxen which I hear? what means &s;o much murmuring and grumbling in many places again&s;t the King and His Court?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you, <HI>Hans,</HI> There has been grum|bling at Kings and Courts, before you and I were born, and will be &s;o when we are dead and votten. It is the nature of the Bea&s;t, (the com|mon people) to be perpetually complaining of the Times, and of the Government. But be&s;ide; Here is a &s;ort of ill-natur'd and ill-nurtur'd peo|ple in this Nation, who would &s;peak evil of, and de&s;pi&s;e even the Son of God him&s;elf, if he &s;hould be &s;ent to Rule over this Kingdom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But in good earne&s;t, <HI>George,</HI> do you not think that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have ju&s;t cau&s;e to com|plain, when they part with &s;uch va&s;t Sums of Money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly no. But I pray how much Money do you think His Maje&s;ty had of us towards the &s;etting forth of this Fleet, the bigge&s;t and the be&s;t provided that ever <HI>England</HI> &s;aw?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much more then our Superiours had of us for their Fleet, which is little inferiour to yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>How much I prethee was that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>About twenty Millions of Guilders, which amounts to about Eighteen hundred thou&s;and pounds Sterling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good; And His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England</HI> &s;ets out this Fleet upon His own proper Charge and Credit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="19" REF="10" MS="y">
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then I &s;uppo&s;e in the mean time it mu&s;t needs be, that the Ordinary Taxes, the Gabels and the Impo&s;ts upon all &s;orts of Commodities in <HI>England</HI> are much heavier then ours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>How heavy is that, <HI>Hans?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>So heavy, that to mention onely in a few. We pay for Hou&s;es yearly the eighth part of the Rent; for Lands, above a third part of the Rent; for all Beer, where we pay the Brewer &s;ix Guil|ders, we pay five Guilders more to the State, and yet the Brewer pays Exci&s;e for his Malt be&s;ides; and no Subject, great or &s;mall, in City or Village, is allowed to Brew any Beer, but is con&s;trained to take it all of the Common Brewer. Then for Wine, All the better &s;ort of people pay a large Exci&s;e for two or three Hog&s;heads, or more, ac|cording to their quality, whether they buy or drink any Wine or not. Then we have a grievous Exci&s;e upon Fire, Candles, Salt, Bread, all &s;orts of Fle&s;h, and indeed almo&s;t upon every thing that is nece&s;&s;ary or expedient for the u&s;e of man: So that counting all, e&s;pecially at this time &s;ince the War begun with <HI>England,</HI> he that hath a hundred pounds coming in by Lands, Hou&s;es, or Trade, pays to the State at lea&s;t 25 <HI>l.</HI> by the year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>Hans,</HI> this you &s;ay amazes me; for I thought you had been a free Common-wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>So we are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wherein con&s;i&s;ts that freedom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are free of our Tongues, we can call our Governours, our Burgoma&s;ters, <HI>Skelm;</HI> and
<PB N="20" REF="11">our States-men, <HI>Hunsfoot;</HI> and talk Trea&s;on without any puni&s;hment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I thought that &s;ince you did with the lo&s;s of &s;o much Bloud and Trea&s;ure, withdraw your necks from under the yoke of a Monarchi|cal or Kingly Government, and changed your State into a Common-wealth, you had been more free from Taxes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>No &s;uch matter, <HI>George;</HI> for one Stiver we paid when we lived under a King, we pay at lea&s;t fifteen Stivers now. But I pray, <HI>George,</HI> an&s;wer me to my former que&s;tion: Are not your Taxes now very grievous in <HI>England?</HI> for I remember that when the Rump Parliament (which we cal|led then <HI>de Engli&s;che Stert Vergadering</HI>) made War again&s;t <HI>Holland,</HI> here was a Tax (for I was then in <HI>England</HI>) of Six&s;core thou&s;and pounds a moneth, for a long time; be&s;ides they had before taken into their hands all the lands of the Crown, of the Church, and of many Nobles who adhered to their King.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>Hans,</HI> whatever was done then, we have now &s;o few Taxes, and tho&s;e &s;o little grie|vous, that I can &s;carce tell whether we have any Tax at all; unle&s;s it be a moderate Exci&s;e of Drinks, and onely &s;uch Drinks as are bought and &s;old. Yes, now I remember one more, that &s;ome murmur again&s;t, and that is (as you have in <HI>Holland</HI>) a Tax upon Dwelling-hou&s;es; but as you pay every year the Eighth part of the yearly Rent to the State, we pay but the Fourtieth part,
<PB N="21" REF="11" MS="y">or thereabouts, to our King: and we call it <HI>Hearth-money,</HI> or <HI>Chimney-money.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Heer, Godt then doth <HI>England</HI> &s;warm at this time with a Race of Jews!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why &s;o, <HI>Hans,</HI> what extravagant conceit is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>They mu&s;t needs be of the Race of the Jews, who being in &s;uch a happy condition above all the Subjects in Chri&s;tendome, yet every where (and more e&s;pecially in <HI>London</HI>) I can hear murmuring continually again&s;t your <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> again&s;t your King and Bi&s;hops.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good <HI>Hans,</HI> what is it that you hear them &s;ay again&s;t our King? God ble&s;s him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry they &s;ay, That this Parliament hath given to this King more money, then any of His Ance&s;tors ever had in five times that &s;pace, and they know not what becomes of it all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hall ea&s;ily grant that His Maje&s;ty hath had great &s;ums of Money &s;ince His Re&s;tauration; yet not &s;o great, but that if we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider, the great Debts which <HI>Cromwell</HI> left due to the Army and Navy; His Maje&s;ties own Debts contracted by Him&s;elf and Brothers beyond the Seas, by our fault, in driving them out of their own Land: then the building of &s;o many and &s;o great Ships of War, almo&s;t every year &s;ince His Re&s;tauration; the Storing of all His huge Magazines with Am|munition for all His land and Naval Forces; the maintaining of &s;o many Garri&s;ons upon all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England;</HI> of &s;o many great Guards of
<PB N="22" REF="12">Hor&s;e and Foot at <HI>London:</HI> but above all, the waging of War &s;ome years again&s;t Three Potent Enemies, the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>French,</HI> and the <HI>Dane.</HI> If we &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the&s;e things, we mu&s;t ra|ther admire how His Maje&s;ty could effect &s;o great things with &s;o little money: For I have been ve|ry credibly informed, that, during the late U&s;ur|pation, one years war between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Hollander</HI> co&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (who were then e&s;teemed very frugal) above &s;eventeen hundred thou&s;and pounds; and yet their Ships and Fleets were not then near &s;o great as now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>George,</HI> I am of your mind in that point, and rather admire what becomes of all the Moneys, which the <HI>&V;nited Provinces</HI> &s;queeze every year out of their Subjects, which is almo&s;t Twenty times as much as ever our Ance&s;tors paid, and almo&s;t Six times the &s;etled yearly Revenue of your King; for our Revenue amounts (as I am a&s;&s;ured) to &s;even Millions of pounds Sterling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I pray, <HI>Hans,</HI> what more have you heard of our King? Can any of tho&s;e Fanatick Grum|blers, or Murmuring Jews, truly &s;ay, That du|ring any twelve years &s;ince the Conque&s;t, the Sub|ject hath had le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ion, le&s;s inju&s;tice from their Sovereign, or more Clemency, and greater Conde&s;cen&s;ions? hath he ever denied His People in Parliament one rea&s;onable reque&s;t? Is not the Law open and Free to protect impartially even the wor&s;t of His Enemies now living, and the wor&s;t of Schi&s;maticks, again&s;t the mo&s;t Loyal and
<PB N="23" REF="12" MS="y">mo&s;t Orthodox of this Kingdom, which is rather admired, then ever imitated by other Nations? Doth not every man at pre&s;ent eat of his own Vine, and of his own Fig-tree, and drink the waters of his own Ci&s;tern? doth not <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> and <HI>Levi</HI> too, &s;it &s;ecurely every one under his own Vine, whereas heretofore the factious &s;acrilegious Rebels, and plundering Robbers, did &s;it under the Vines, and eat of the Grapes, which did unque&s;tionably belong to the Loyal Hone&s;t Nobility and Gentry, to the Orthodox, Learned, Pious Clergy, to God and His Holy Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do&s;t thou think, <HI>George,</HI> that His Maje&s;ty takes a true mea&s;ure of the Intere&s;t of His People, e&s;pecially in this War?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou wilt have my opinion, <HI>Hans,</HI> I do believe, that no Prince under&s;tands his Intere&s;t better, and that he &s;hews it particularly in this very War. Tell me, <HI>Hans,</HI> and confe&s;s ingenu|ou&s;ly; do not you think that the grand Intere&s;t of <HI>England</HI> is to maintain Trade, and in order there|unto, to maintain the Empire of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Seas again&s;t all Encroachers what&s;oever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not fit for me that am a <HI>Hollander</HI> to &s;peak to that point, but I know what I think.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, did ever any King of <HI>England</HI> mind more that Intere&s;t, then our pre&s;ent Sovereign, who&s;e Royal Father and Grandfather were in|deed very worthy Princes, and ought in their times to have &s;et about this work which is now in hand. Did ever any King make it more his
<PB N="24" REF="13">bu&s;ine&s;s to inform him&s;elf touching Maritime Af|fairs; nay, I have been a&s;&s;ured, that there is &s;earce a Sea-man in this Nation, that under&s;tands better the Building, the Rigging, the Victualling, the Charges, and the very Sailing of a Ship, then His Maje&s;ty of <HI>England,</HI> that under&s;tands better the Timber and Materials for Shipping, that can make better choice of Ship-carpenters; that no King in Chri&s;tendom ever favoured &s;o much the mo&s;t ingenious per&s;ons of that mo&s;t u&s;eful Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, that can make better choice of a Sea-man, that none ever &s;o much valued, cheri&s;hed, and en|couraged Mariners, that ever &s;o well under&s;tood all our Coa&s;ts, Seas, Flats, Sholes, Sands; and above all, the be&s;t way of fighting at Sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, as the ca&s;e now &s;tands, it is hard to wi&s;h for a better Prince in that re&s;pect for you, and a wor&s;e for us: and yet I am confident, if a la&s;ting Peace were once concluded between us, He would be our be&s;t Friend in the world, and if need were, would protect us, as His Ance&s;tors have ever done, again&s;t all others that &s;hould ever attempt to wrong us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, <HI>Hans,</HI> do but con&s;ider how he hath thought nothing too much to promote this Grand Intere&s;t, His Maje&s;ty hath not &s;pared the apparent hazarding of the Life of His onely Brother the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> at Sea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in good faith, <HI>George,</HI> he hath hazarded it with a witne&s;s now; for the Wind and Wea|ther favouring us this la&s;t Summer, we had him in
<PB N="25" REF="13" MS="y">the mid&s;t of ten or twelve of our principal Ships, at &s;uch an unexpected advantage, that it was al|mo&s;t a miracle he &s;hould e&s;cape our hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Hans,</HI> as I have been certainly in|formed, His Royal Highne&s;s did in the la&s;t En|gagement behave him&s;elf with that Activene&s;s and Conduct, with that Courage and Undaunted|ne&s;s, when he was &s;ore pre&s;&s;ed on every &s;ide, his Ship torn, and many of his be&s;t friends about him &s;lain, and hath &s;ince endured many &s;torms, and great hard&s;hip, with &s;uch patience, for the &s;ervice of our King and Countrey, that no Prince of the Bloud &s;ince the Conque&s;t hath better de|&s;erved to be brought home with triumph, and received by this City with all expre&s;&s;ions of joy and gratitude.</P>
<P>But moreover, <HI>Hans,</HI> (to go on where we left) His Maje&s;ty hath not &s;pared to hazard the Per&s;on and Life of His dearly beloved Son, his Grace the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> together with many of His choice and mo&s;t valiant Nobility and Gentry. Al&s;o to promote this grand De&s;ign of pre&s;erving the ju&s;t Right and Dominion of the Sea, and to recover, and thereby advance the Trade of His Subjects. That He might the better provide for His Shipping and Sea-men, His Maje&s;ty hath been plea&s;ed to &s;ave even as it were out of His own belly, and out of the bellies of all His Do|me&s;tick Servants, by a great and long retrench|ment of His Court-tables, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, good Yonker <HI>George,</HI> &s;ay no more; I
<PB N="26" REF="14">perceive well enough, that <HI>Benefacere &amp; mal&eacute; audire Regium e&s;t.</HI> It is too oft the fate of Kings (witne&s;s the la&s;t good King) to be very ill &s;poken of when they do be&s;t for their Subjects good. I marvel what it is, that this ill-natured people would have? When they had long abu&s;ed, and at length murthered the be&s;t King, if not the be&s;t Man then in the world, and for that cau&s;e might very rea&s;onably have expected, that God &s;hould have &s;ent them next the wor&s;t of Tyrants, or &s;ome U&s;urper, &s;ome Heretical or Infidel King, to oppre&s;s them, and &s;courge them to death with Whips and Scorpions, as they well de&s;erved; that God &s;hould even then be &s;o gracious, as to &s;end them their own King, the true undoubted Heir of the Crown of <HI>England:</HI> Sure if they were not an ungrateful people, they &s;hould be ever prai&s;ing God for &s;o un&s;peakable a benefit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay more, <HI>Hans,</HI> God hath not onely &s;ent us our own King, but one that in His long ab|&s;ence abroad, among&s;t tho&s;e of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Reli|gion, was never tainted with any of their Errours, but at His fir&s;t Re&s;tauration, made it His fir&s;t work to re&s;tore (like another good King <HI>Hezekiah</HI>) Gods true Religion, the Rights and Revenues of the Church, the Prie&s;ts and Levites, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>George,</HI> there is one or two things more, whereat many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of my acquaintance oft grumble, to an&s;wer which, I would be glad to be able; and that is, They cry there is le&s;s Trade, and le&s;s Money in the Nation, and more Lewd|ne&s;s,
<PB N="27" REF="14" MS="y">Libertini&s;m, Incontinence, Intemperance, Debauchery, Irreligion, and Athei&s;m, and a grea|ter growth of Popery, then ever was; and that generally <HI>England</HI> is in a le&s;s flouri&s;hing condition then heretofore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, <HI>Hans,</HI> you have had ill luck to fall in|to very bad company &s;ince you came into <HI>Eng|land.</HI> I know very well, that we have too many <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are largely endowed with all tho&s;e qualifications of the antient <HI>Jews,</HI> whereof the Almighty &s;o oft complained. I know here are di|vers, who are not onely &s;tubborn and &s;tiff-necked, as tho&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> were, but at that very time when God is leading them into the Land of Promi&s;e, (into Peace and Plenty) they are ever and anon murmuring and complaining, wi&s;hing them&s;elves back into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and whining after their Leeks and Onions there (<HI>Numb.</HI> 11.5.) wi&s;hing for our former Arbitrary Tyrannical Government, under mo&s;t di&s;loyal treacherous U&s;urpers and Traitours. As for the fir&s;t complaint, of le&s;s Trade and le&s;s Money, it is apparent by His Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms, lately Farmed at a higher rate then ever, that the Trade in general cannot be much dimini&s;hed: then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that during the late wicked Rebellion, more Youths of all conditions being then put to Trades, for want of other em|ployments, it is now come to pa&s;s, that they be|ing &s;et up, the Kingdom is much over&s;tockt with Traders; all &s;orts of Trades are now divided into &s;o many hands, that none of them can gain as
<PB N="28" REF="15">heretofore, and few of them are able to live one by another. La&s;tly, it is no wonder that our Trade &s;hould be &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened, when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> make it their main bu&s;ine&s;s, by Lies and Cheats, mo&s;t treacherou&s;ly and ungratefully, as afore mentioned, to &s;upplant all our Foreign Trade; which to prevent, our pre&s;ent Sovereign ever &s;ince His Re&s;toration hath made it His main bu&s;ine&s;s (by &s;till augmenting His Naval Power) and is now, God be ble&s;&s;ed, almo&s;t arrived at His wi&s;hed Port. As for the other point, that we have le&s;s Money, we may al&s;o thank the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for the &s;ame; for it is well known, that they having mo&s;t unju&s;tly taken from us the <HI>Spicy I&s;lands</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> (one of which <HI>(Poleroon)</HI> they have by four &s;everal Treaties &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to re&s;tore, and yet is not done to this day) we are forced, as afore&s;aid, to part with 400000 <HI>l.</HI> a year for Spices, and &s;o proportionably for other Commodities. As for Loo&s;ne&s;s, Intemperance, Debauchery, Incontinence, Irreligion, Athei&s;m, and Popery; if there be more thereof then heretofore, where mu&s;t ju&s;tly lie all the blame, but even at the doors of tho&s;e very Murmurers, and their Pre|dece&s;&s;ors, who fir&s;t di&s;turbed, and then over|turned the be&s;t govern'd State and Church in the world, letting in all &s;orts of Religions, which all wi&s;e men then fore&s;aw would end at length in Ir|religion, Popery, and Athei&s;m, from whence mu&s;t needs follow all Loo&s;ene&s;s and Debauchery. And indeed, the I&s;&s;ue and Con&s;equence of
<PB N="29" REF="15" MS="y">that <GAP DESC="foreign">, that Plurality of Religions in this Kingdom, at fir&s;t countenanced by the factious part of the Long Parliament, was by many &s;ober pru|dent men then foretold to be either Popery, or el&s;e Irreligion, Prophanene&s;s, and Athei&s;m. And I remember that St. <HI>William</HI> (I mean the holy Mar|tyr Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud,</HI> who being murthered on the day of St. <HI>William</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Bourges</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> which was the tenth of <HI>January,</HI> &s;eems to claim a place in our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kalendar) upon the Scaffold told us, who were then &s;orrowful Spe|ctators of his Martyrdom, That the Pope never &s;ince the Reformation had &s;o great a Harve&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> as by the many Sects and Religions then introduced: And indeed, when that excellent Per&s;on, together with the High Commi&s;&s;ion Court, tho&s;e two principal Bulwarks again&s;t Po|pery, Here&s;ies, Schi&s;ms, and all Licentiou&s;ne&s;s, were thrown down by the then prevailing <HI>Prsby|terian,</HI> no wonder if tho&s;e Enormities have ever &s;ince encrea&s;ed among&s;t us.</P>

<P>But I hear &s;ome &s;ay farther, That this King|dom doth not flouri&s;h as heretofore, the times are now harder, and the Subject in a wor&s;e condition then formerly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, <HI>Hans,</HI> to have read and ob&s;erv|ed in our Hi&s;tories of <HI>England,</HI> among&s;t other things, that throughout all the mo&s;t happy Reigns of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> and the fir&s;t part of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Martyr, there were a &s;ort of people that were known by the name of <HI>Grumb|lers,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="16">who in &s;tead of prai&s;ing God for His great de|liverances, and abundant ble&s;&s;ings, would be al|ways murmuring again&s;t the Times; a People that through the gall and bitterne&s;s of their own hearts, did &s;o far lo&s;e their Ta&s;tes and Judgments, that their whole practi&s;e was to deprive God of His Glory, the Prince of His Honour, and the People of their Sen&s;es; affirming that the condi|tion of <HI>England</HI> was very mi&s;erable, and full of the Tokens of Gods wrath and indignation; when the whole Nation was happy even to the envy of Chri&s;tendome. And no wonder if you meet with &s;ome of that ill conditioned Race at this day. I confe&s;s that I have met with &s;ome, who having heard or read of the cau&s;ele&s;s complaints made by factious &s;pirits, and di&s;contented people again&s;t the la&s;t King, do now begin to tread the &s;ame &s;teps, railing again&s;t the Kings Court, &s;landering the Government and Governours, like railing <HI>Rab|&s;heka's,</HI> and foul-mouth'd <HI>Shimeis:</HI> They are zea|lous in procuring a Divorce between their Sove|reign and His Subjects hearts and affections; whereas true Chri&s;tianity, and true Allegiance, doth in&s;truct and oblige every Subject to be more careful of His Sovereigns Credit and Honour, then of his own, and with the two mode&s;t &s;ons of Noah, no &s;ooner to know then to hide their fa|thers nakedne&s;s. It is very true, <HI>Hans,</HI> that there is no Government on earth perfect, nor are Gover|nours without humane infirmities; and there is no time but it hath &s;omething more laudable, then
<PB N="31" REF="16" MS="y">the foregoing or &s;ucceeding times. But if any one will &s;eriou&s;ly reflect on the whole Twelve years Reign of our Dread Sovereign now Reigning. I dare affirm, (without the lea&s;t flattery) that he &s;hall hardly find in the like &s;pace of time, in any other Princes Reign, either at home or abroad, &s;o great plenty and abundance of all things, for the u&s;e or delight of mankind, &s;o va&s;t an encrea&s;e of Buildings, &s;o many &s;tately Palaces, fair Churches, mighty Ships of War; &s;o great improvement of Lands in all places, both Arable and Pa&s;ture; &s;o many Plantations of Trees, both for Fruit and Timber; Parks and Forre&s;ts new &s;tored with the be&s;t Veni&s;on in the world; mighty Plantations abroad, new Inventions and Handy-crafts, indeed all Arts and Sciences, improved at home; old Inventions daily bettered, Rivers made Naviga|ble, new Fortre&s;&s;es and Havens, both at home and and abroad, and tho&s;e made far more commodious by mighty Moles and Piers. Moreover he &s;hall hardly find &s;o long a time &s;o free from Inju&s;tice, or from Oppre&s;&s;ion, where King and Nobles have le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ed the Commons, where there hath been &s;o great Conde&s;cen&s;ions and Indulgences to tender Con&s;ciences: and if it be true, that as <HI>multa funera &s;unt opprobria Medicorum,</HI> &s;o <HI>multa &s;upplicia &s;unt opprobria Principum.</HI> It will be much for the Honour of His Maje&s;ty, and His twelve years Go|vernment, that here have not been one Nobleman put to death, and &s;o few of others at all the A&s;|&s;izes in this Kingdom, that the like was never
<PB N="32" REF="17">known in the memory of any man living; and yet &s;uch impartial Ju&s;tice every where, that we have fewer Robberies, Murders, Duels, then ever. Be&s;ides all this, there is nothing more true, that &s;ince His Maje&s;ties Re&s;tauration, all people generally over all <HI>England,</HI> both in Cities, Towns, and Villages, dwell in fairer Hou&s;es, tho&s;e Hou|&s;es are more richly furni&s;hed; Men and Women are more co&s;tly clothed, eat and drink bettter, then any of their forefathers of the &s;ame quality and condition, and perhaps then any other Nation at this day under the Sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good <HI>George,</HI> proceed no farther; your peo|ple would be too happy, if they knew their own happine&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But prethee, <HI>Hans,</HI> what do&s;t thou hear our Nonconformi&s;ts, and &s;uch Malecontents, &s;ay of our Bi&s;hops; for you told me they murmured again&s;t <HI>Aaron</HI> as well as <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much, <HI>George,</HI> but &s;omewhat heavy; for they &s;ay, your Bi&s;hops, and other Dignified Cler|gy, are Idle and Idol-&s;hepherds; that they are co|vetous, dumb Dogs, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a heavy charge indeed, but do you believe any of this to be true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly very little, for I have had the honour to be acquainted with divers of them, and I have always found them well employed about their Charge; &s;o free from Idolatry, that to an impar|tial Judge, who hath &s;een other Reformed Churches abroad, there is &s;carce any Church in
<PB N="33" REF="17" MS="y">Chri&s;tendome, but gives as much occa&s;ion of &s;can|dal that way: Then as for Covetou&s;ne&s;s, I can &s;ay &s;o much, that all tho&s;e whom I know, do keep &s;o good Ho&s;pitality, are &s;o charitable to the Poor, that I am confident, very few of them will be able to leave to their Children or Relations &s;o much as one of the meane&s;t Lawyers, Merchants, or Gen|tlemen of this Kingdom: But as to that charge of Dumb Dogs, I know not well what to &s;ay; for I think they preach but &s;eldom, and therefore &s;eem not to de&s;erve &s;o much means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>Hans,</HI> I was once of that mind too, till I well con&s;idered, Fir&s;t, That it is not now among&s;t us, as it was in the Primitive times; for tho&s;e <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> lived in the mid&s;t of <HI>Jews, Heathens,</HI> and <HI>In|fidels</HI> to whom it was nece&s;&s;ary, that the Go&s;pel, or glad Tidings of Chri&s;ts being come in the Fle&s;h to redeem the world (which is properly the Go|&s;pel) &s;hould upon all occa&s;ions be proclaimed (for that is properly preaching the Go&s;pel, and not our manner of making of Harangues in a Pulpit) in all places among&s;t the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That there were then but a &s;mall num|ber of Learned Divines, who were well able to ar|gue the ca&s;e, and convince Unbelievers of this Truth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, The number of Souls under each Bi|&s;hop were not then &s;o many, but that a Bi&s;hop might with ea&s;e both Govern and Teach the peo|ple.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That now the number of Teachers, and the &s;everal Congregations and Churches
<PB N="34" REF="18">under the Bi&s;hops care, are &s;o many, that it is be|come enough to be the Task-ma&s;ter, to have one|ly a due care, that the Inferiour Clergy duly Preach, and perform rightly their duties in their &s;everal Congregations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then is it not unrea&s;onable, that tho&s;e who &s;eem to &s;it &s;till, &s;hould have &s;o much means, and tho&s;e that &s;weat and bear the heat of the day, I mean tho&s;e that Preach, &s;hould have &s;o little?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you have been at Sea, <HI>Hans,</HI> where you have &s;een many Sea-men pull at the Ropes, hazard their lives in triming the Ship, &s;weat and take great pains; whil&s;t the long-experienced &s;o|ber wi&s;e Pilot &s;its &s;till at the Helm, con&s;idering the Ships Cour&s;e, comparing that with the Winds and Tides, with the Sea&s;on of the Year; the Flats and Shelves, the Sands and Rocks, the Pirates and Enemies, &amp;c. without who&s;e con&s;tant Conduct (notwith&s;tanding all the others toil and pains) the Ship would not be &s;afe perhaps one hour: Will you now &s;ay, that it is unrea&s;onable, that this man &s;hould have a better Salary, then any of tho&s;e other labouring Mariners?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, <HI>George,</HI> your <HI>Simile</HI> is &s;o appo&s;ite, that I &s;hall never more give ear to the&s;e barking Curs; but on the contrary &s;hall love and honour tho&s;e whom they &s;o undutifully and impiou&s;ly &s;tyle <HI>Dumb Dogs.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be&s;ides, all wi&s;e men know, that as it is ve|ry dangerous for a Pilot to quit the Helm, and pull at the Ropes, &s;o it hath been oft &s;een, that where a Bi&s;hop of a large Dioce&s;s hath been very
<PB N="35" REF="18" MS="y">Booki&s;h, and oft in the Pulpit, that Dioce&s;s hath mo&s;t u&s;ually been wor&s;t governed.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Hans,</HI> what &s;hould we trouble our &s;elves longer upon this &s;ubject; for I have ob&s;erved, that in all this Kingdom, there are &s;carce any, but either &s;ome ill-natur'd and ill-nurtur'd Gentry, or el&s;e &s;ome half-learned or half-witted Commonal|ty, who will open their mouths again&s;t our Bi&s;hops or Clergy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, <HI>George,</HI> here's a War begun, you &s;ay, upon your Kings Credit: but where's the Money to carry it on?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not con&s;ider, <HI>Hans,</HI> that it is the Peoples War as well as the King, and they'l never want money to pre&s;erve them&s;elves. Can you ima|gine, that when the Parliament comes together again, they will not immediately take His Maje|&s;ties Supply into con&s;ideration. A Prince who by His infinite care of the grand Intere&s;t of this Na|tion (which I told you before is the Dominion of the Sea) hath &s;o far obliged all His Subjects, as His maje&s;ty hath done above and beyond His Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, who ought to have undertaken this work, of &s;topping the prodigious growth of the <HI>Hollan|der</HI> in their Reigns, when it was far more fea&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hear &s;ome &s;ay, It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to rai&s;e &s;uch a Sum at this time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good <HI>Hans,</HI> you will &s;ay the&s;e men are very &s;hort-&s;ighted that tell you &s;o, when I &s;hall have &s;hewed you, how above two millions yearly may ea&s;ily be rai&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> without ever grieving the people; which is a piece of Policy that I learn|ed
<PB N="36" REF="19">in your Countrey, when I lived there.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray how is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not by Land-tax, or Hou&s;e-tax, or Hearth-money, or Poll-money, or by any other way where Money is taken from the People in the Lump, for that is ever very grievous unto them, as an old wi&s;e States-man in <HI>Holland</HI> once told me, that they had &s;everal times found by woful experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>In good faith onely by &s;mall Exci&s;es, and that fir&s;t upon &s;uch Commodities that naturally oc|ca&s;ion Exce&s;s, Luxury, Pride, Wantonne&s;s, Idle|ne&s;s, or corruption of Manners; as upon Wines, and all &s;trong Drinks; upon Sugars, Spices, Sauces, Rai&s;ins, Currans, and all &s;orts of Sweet meats; then upon all &s;orts of Laces, Ribbons, Silks, and fine Li|nen; upon Cards, Dice, Tables; upon Coaches, Sedans; upon all &s;orts of Jewels, Fans, Feathers, Perywigs, Pictures, Looking-gla&s;&s;es, Plate, and Hangings. And in ca&s;e &s;uch as the&s;e will not rai&s;e enough, then to lay a &s;mall Exci&s;e upon &s;ome few of tho&s;e Commodities, that are mo&s;t generally and mo&s;t con&s;tantly u&s;ed; as upon all Butchers meat, Bread, Butter, Chee&s;e, Salt, Candles, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Heer, have you all the&s;e Commodities Unexci&s;ed, and &s;uffer your King to want money? when as almo&s;t all the Kingdoms and States in <HI>Eu|rope</HI> have Exci&s;ed all of them, and as many more; when as in our Seven Provinces, which have not half &s;o many people as <HI>England,</HI> we have for many years rai&s;ed above Sixteen hundred thou&s;and pound Sterling out of tho&s;e Commodities, and
<PB N="37" REF="19" MS="y">yet no man complains, but all grow rich.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pray, <HI>Hans,</HI> do me the favour to inform me, by what Rules you lay your Exci&s;es there: for I know, that in the late long Wars with <HI>Spain,</HI> you were put to all the &s;hifts imaginable of rai&s;ing Moneys the mo&s;t commode&s;t and be&s;t way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, <HI>George;</HI> and I remember, that once we were &s;o put to our &s;hifts, that having laid &s;o high an Exci&s;e as would be born upon all &s;orts of Commo|dities, that were to be bought and &s;old, which I be|lieve are almo&s;t 200. we yet wanted money to carry on the War again&s;t the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> who then pre&s;&s;ed us &s;ore; whereupon our <HI>Lords States General</HI> propo&s;ed a very con&s;iderable &s;um of money to any one who could invent a way to rai&s;e a con&s;iderable Standing Revenue, without grieving the people; and an hone&s;t Mini&s;ter of <HI>Harlem</HI> thereupon invented (by a kind of in&s;piration I think) that admirable Tax of Sealed Pa|per, which our Adver&s;ary &s;oon made u&s;e of in <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;ince many other Countreys have done the like; the manner of which Tax I &s;hall relate to you at &s;ome other time, and will now tell you by what Rules we lay our Exci&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was the thing I chiefly de&s;ired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t know then, that as Exci&s;es are the mo&s;t equal, and le&s;s grievous Tax of all other, &s;o the main rule in rai&s;ing them is, that you may charge any Com|modity &s;o high, as you do no way hinder the con&s;um|ption of that Commodity: as for example, Who would ever u&s;e the le&s;s Sugar, if one peny Exci&s;e were paid out of 12 peniworth? Who would u&s;e the fewer Ribbons, for 2 <HI>d.</HI> Exci&s;e upon every 12 <HI>d?</HI> Who would
<PB N="38" REF="20">play the le&s;s at Cards or Dice, if 3 <HI>d.</HI> were paid out of 12 <HI>d?</HI> What Lady would ever forbear to wear Pearls or Diamonds, or to buy Fans and Looking-gla&s;&s;es, if 4 <HI>d.</HI> were laid upon every 12 <HI>d?</HI> Who would forbear to keep a Coach for 5 <HI>l.</HI> Exci&s;e <HI>per annum?</HI> So if there were 6 <HI>d.</HI> upon every ounce of Plate, who would u&s;e the le&s;s in his hou&s;e?</P>
<P>Now if the&s;e and &s;uch like Exci&s;es will not &s;erve to di&s;charge the publick Debts and Expences of the Crown, without an Exci&s;e upon tho&s;e other more ne|ce&s;&s;ary Commodities, as Fle&s;h, Butter, and Chee&s;e, &amp;c. who would &s;pend the le&s;s of them in his hou&s;e, if there were laid upon every pound but a half peny, or upon a pound of Candles a peny.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then, <HI>Hans,</HI> me-thinks that will not rai&s;e any con&s;iderable &s;um.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot at fir&s;t &s;ight imagine what great &s;ums they would rai&s;e. I remember, once taking no|tice by chance of the great number of Candles, burnt in the Shops and Hou&s;es of this your City and Sub|urbs of <HI>London,</HI> I with &s;ome other informed our &s;elves of the number of Families, and at length found, that one peny Exci&s;e upon a pound of Candles, would amount to at lea&s;t eighty thou&s;and pounds in a year; and yet your Chandlers are &s;uffered &s;ometimes to rai&s;e their prizes as much at their own plea&s;ure, and no man regards it. So likewi&s;e your Cole-mongers are per|mitted to rai&s;e their Coals, &s;ometimes 10 <HI>s.</HI> in a Chal|dron at their own plea&s;ure; and others to rai&s;e Soap a peny in the pound, &amp;c. Will any one then grudge &s;o much to be taxed upon any of tho&s;e Com|modities towards the publick Charges of the King|dome?
<PB N="39" REF="20" MS="y">Certainly he mu&s;t be a malignant ill-natur'd Subject that will do it. But I know a better way then all the&s;e, in my opinion, to rai&s;e a very con&s;iderable &s;um of money, and even plea&s;ure the people thereby.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>In good faith, <HI>Hans,</HI> you might thereby much oblige our King and all His People; e&s;pecially at this time, when there is &s;o great need of money to pay publick Debts, and to defray the va&s;t Charges of our Naval and Land Forces, of our many Garri&s;ons, Guards, &amp;c. Charges far above and beyond any that His Maje&s;ties Predece&s;&s;ors ever knew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>The way then briefly is this, We have found by long experience in <HI>Holland,</HI> that to &s;uffer no man to brew his own Beer, hath this great benefit, that every man may drink better and cheaper then he could po&s;&s;i|bly do, if he brewed it him&s;elf. And I have been cer|tainly informed, that not onely the <HI>Londoners,</HI> but al&s;o mo&s;t of the Villages within ten or twenty miles of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> now choo&s;e rather to buy their Beer of the pub|lick Brewers thereabouts, and pay Exci&s;e, then to trouble them&s;elves to brew at home, though then it &s;hould be free from all Exci&s;e. Now if there were an Act of Parliament for &s;etting up Brew-hou&s;es in all or mo&s;t of the Market-Towns of <HI>England,</HI> and that no place within a mile or two of tho&s;e Market-Towns &s;hould be &s;uffered to Brew their own Beer, but to take it of tho&s;e Brewers, as all our <HI>Dorps</HI> do in <HI>Holland;</HI> the ordinary Exci&s;e upon all that Beer brewed then by tho&s;e publick Brewers, would by computation amount to near 300000 <HI>l.</HI> a year, more then what the Exci&s;e of Beer and Ale now comes to in <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would to God, <HI>Hans,</HI> you were able to con|vince
<PB N="40" REF="21">our Parliament-men of the commodiou&s;ne&s;s of Exci&s;es, it might be much more happy for King and People then other Taxes; as the la&s;t Sub&s;idy, where the People were di&s;contented in paying but &s;o much in the Lump, and the King had rea&s;on to be more di&s;|contented that many paid not one moiety of what they ought to have paid. But one thing more, <HI>Hans,</HI> I would gladly learn of you, and that is, The right way of Collecting Exci&s;es, that the Subjects may not be much di&s;turbed and abu&s;ed, and yet the King not de|frauded of His Due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Yonker <HI>George,</HI> that is a great My&s;tery, and there is much Art and Prudence to be u&s;ed therein: my Countrey-men on the other &s;ide of the Sea were many years, before they could arrive to that perfection and skill, which they now have above all other Nations. This I know, that &s;ome Exci&s;es they always take in kind, and Collect by Officers of the State; others they always Let to Farm: But if you will learn the right way, you need but &s;end over &s;ome under&s;tanding man, who &s;taying there but &s;o long, as a Bill is u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ing in both Hou&s;es of Parliament, at his return will be able to teach you in an hour, that which did co&s;t us many years experience, with much trouble and pains. So my good Yonker <HI>George,</HI> Adieu for this time, I mu&s;t leave you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>G.</SPEAKER>
<P>Farewell, hone&s;t <HI>Hans;</HI> I thank you for your good company, and &s;hall be very glad that we may meet &s;hortly again, and have further di&s;cour&s;e of the&s;e Affairs.</P>
