<P>I crave leave to Apologize, in rendring an account, for this Dedication, it is not Presumptuous vain-glory, or Sordid flattery, or Covetous desire of gain that procured it; but first, this Countrey is in some measure come into your possession; secondly, the weighty Actions on foot therein, have been, and are steered, and guided by your prudent Heads, and victorious Armes.

<P>_IT is usual with Writers of these sub|jects<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

<P>It is one of the seventeen Provinces, which did<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.

<P>The People being civiliz'd, and reduced to<NOTE PLACE="marg">4.

<P>It was anciently bounded by the Sea, and the<NOTE PLACE="marg">5.

<P>This County of <HI>Flanders</HI> exceeds most of her o|ther<NOTE PLACE="marg">11.

<HI>Newport, Dunkerk, Graveling, Dam, Burburgh, Dix|mude, Vuerne, Ardenburgh, Ninove, Winoxbergh, Grammont, Cassel, Demsee, Orchier, Lannoy.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these, there are thirty other great<NOTE PLACE="marg">12.

our help, this famous battel was fought with at least fourty five thousand men on both sides.</P>
<P>And now at present this County of <HI>Flanders</HI> is the Seat of Warre, wherein <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> are tugging against <HI>Spain,</HI> and hitherto have performed admirable service, as the taking of <HI>Bourburgh</HI> and <HI>Mardike,</HI> the surrender of <HI>Dunkerk</HI> into our hands, that Town so infamous for Piracies; the great o|verthrow given to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> striving to relieve it, with a great number of field Officers and others, made prisoners, the speedy gaining of <HI>VVinnoxberg, Vuern, Dixmude,</HI> Towns that have all of them titles added to their names; as <HI>Dunkerk</HI> for trade, <HI>Win|noxbergh</HI> for a gallant Market, <HI>Vuern</HI> for pleasure, and <HI>Dixmude</HI> for excellent butter.</P>
<P>And at this Instant that strong seated, deep moated and treble-walled Town of <HI>Graveling</HI> is be|sieged, <HI>Newport</HI> and <HI>Ostend</HI> kept close In, which when gain'd will cause the <HI>Spaniard</HI> to shrug and shrink in his bombasted titles and Bravadoes; and be a just cause of <HI>Englands</HI> triumph, and rejoycing over the proud <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
