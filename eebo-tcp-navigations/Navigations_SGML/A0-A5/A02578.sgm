<P>There are two occa&s;ions where|in Trauell may pa&s;&s;e, Matter of trafique, and Matter of State. Some commodities GOD hath confined to &s;ome countries, vpon others hee hath with a full hand powred tho&s;e benefits, which hee hath but &s;prinkled vpon &s;ome. His wi&s;e prouidence hath made one Countrey the Granary, ano|ther the Celler, another the Or|chard, another the Ar&s;enall of their neighbours, yea of the remo|te&s;t parts. The earth is the Lords which he meant not to keepe in his hands, but to giue; and hee which hath giuen no man his faculties and graces for him&s;elfe, nor put light into the Sun, Moone, Stars for their owne v&s;e, hath &s;tored no parcell of earth with a purpo&s;e of priuate re&s;eruation. <HI>Salomon</HI> would neuer haue &s;ent his nauie
