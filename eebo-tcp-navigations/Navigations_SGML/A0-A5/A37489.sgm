<P>His Father was &s;trangely Surpriz'd to &s;ee him&s;elf prevented in his di&s;c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">very, and com|manded <HI>Ama&s;ius</HI> to tell him how he came by his Intelligence, &s;uppo&s;ing that contrary to his or|der

<P>Ama&s;ius <HI>humbly beg'd his Pardon, and a&s;&s;ur'd him, it was not from his Relations or any Per&s;on el&s;e he had Entru&s;ted with the Secret, that he came by the knowledge of it, and earne&s;tly pray'd him not to pre&s;s that que&s;tion any farther, which if in Obedience to his Commands he &s;hould be oblig'd to An|&s;wer, would yet add more to that weight of &s;orrow he &s;o mi&s;erably labour'd under.</HI></P>
<P>This made the old Gentleman his Father the more Inqui&s;itive, who conjur'd him by that re|&s;pect and duty he ow'd him as his Father, to give him a plain and Satisfactory account, which without any excu&s;e he immediately expected from him.</P>
<P><HI>Well Sir, &s;aid</HI> Ama&s;ius, <HI>&s;ince you will extort a Secret from me, which of all things can only make me more &V;nhappy, take it, and Judge if my Duty to you is not above all regard to my &s;elf &mdash; Here</HI> Ama&s;ius <HI>ac|quainted his Father how he had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en</HI> Or|telia, <HI>and the di&s;cour&s;e he had with her, the Night before his intended Nuptials, Ad|ding

<P>Some time after his Father by the Advice of his Friends, remov'd <HI>Ama&s;ius</HI> into the Countrey, and having &s;everal Relations and acquaintance near <HI>York,</HI> that place was fixt upon, hoping that Change of Air and variety of Company might be of advantage to his Health, and a diver&s;ion to his Melancholy. But Alas! He never En|joy'd a Minute free from the thoughts of his fair decea&s;'d <HI>Ortelia,</HI> the only Intervals of plea|&s;ure he had, were when the kind Gho&s;t of <HI>Orte|telia</HI> came to vi&s;it him, which &s;he was often wont to do, or at lea&s;t his deluded Fancy Imagined &s;o, from that time (when by the Severity of his Fa|ther he was forc't to di&s;cover that he had both &s;een and di&s;cour&s;ed with her the Night before the intended Marriage.) At &s;everal times would he &s;tart upon a &s;udden from his Company, &s;ay|ing, do you not hear <HI>Ortelia</HI>'s voice? I come, I come, my Dear, Ah there &s;he is, pray do but ob&s;erve how kindly the poor <HI>Ortelia</HI> looks on her <HI>Ama&s;ius,</HI> &s;ee how Melancholy and pale &s;he is, how beautifully &s;orrowful &s;he Glances at me, Oh my Dear I come, but when &s;hall I come, never

And then retireing into the next Room, would talk with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ionate Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of Love and tenderne&s;s to her, as if he did really Conver&s;e with her in the vi&s;ible form of Fle&s;h and Blood. Thus did he pa&s;s away about half a year, when one Night after he had been walking and di&s;cour&s;ing with her for at lea&s;t two Hours (tho' at all the&s;e &s;everal times &s;he was never &s;een by any Per&s;on but him&s;elf, &s;ometimes indeed they could di&s;tingui&s;h two &s;everal Voices) when returning to his Friends more plea&s;ant and Merry then ever he had been before, I thank Heaven, &s;ayes he, my &s;orrows have now found a period; I have but few nights more to repo&s;e on Earth, and then &s;hall I live with my <HI>Ortelia,</HI> and enjoy Eternal Re&s;t of Bo|dy and Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nquillity of mind.

<P>IT was the unhappine&s;s of <HI>Cratander,</HI> who&s;e Ge|nero&s;ity very often out-&s;tript his prudence, and his Natural Bounty the Narrow Confines

Hallowing to know who liv'd there, the Shepherd came out, of whom he Enquired the way to the Town he intended to Lodge at that Night, the Shep|herd told him he was five Miles off, and the way difficult to find, if he was a &s;tranger in the Countrey, <HI>Cratander</HI> told him he was, and had already lo&s;t his way and tired his Hor&s;e, and if he would be &s;o kind to give him Accommo|dation for that night, he would gratifie him to his Content.</P>
<P><HI>The Shepherd told him his was a Hou&s;e but of one Room, tho' plentifully Furni&s;h'd with Inhabitants, that be&s;ides his Wife and him&s;elf he had Six Children, and but one Bed, and a Matre&s;s, and not &s;o much as a Hovell to put his Hor&s;e in.</HI></P>

<P>A Gentleman who had been formerly a Mer|chant in the City of <HI>London,</HI> and acquir'd a con&s;iderable E&s;tate, withdrew into the Coun|try, having Spent his younger years in the Noi&s;e and hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, re&s;olved now to enjoy the fruits of his Labours in quiet, and Gratifie him&s;elf with Solitude and Retirement; having a fair Hou&s;e in <HI>Hartford&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ire</HI> he in|clined to fix there, where he was eminently ho&s;|pitable to the Gentry, and Charitable to the poor.

<PB N="98" REF="55"> to &s;ay he grew Rich in &s;pight of his Teeth, for if he &s;hut Money out at the door, it would come in at the Window. This Gentleman at his death left only one Child a Daughter call'd <HI>Joanna,</HI> to whom he gave a very great Fortune, and committed the care of her Per&s;on and ma|nagement of her E&s;tate to two Gentlemen her Guardians. She was now about Eight years old when &s;he de&s;ir'd &s;he might (as &s;he u&s;ually did once a year) go &s;ee her Uncle, a Gentleman of fair Reputation and good E&s;tate in <HI>E&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">x,</HI> which they granted, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt her over attended with two Servants.

The next Morning early &s;he &s;tole out of the Hou&s;e, and after &s;he had wander'd &s;ome Hours not knowing whether to go, met with a Company of <HI>Gip&s;ies</HI> who took her up, made much of her, changing her Cloths and &s;taining her C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">mplexion, brought her with them in few dayes to <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">don,</HI> and from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nce went their Rounds into <HI>Hamp&s;h re,

The Uncle mi&s;&s;ing his Neece next day, made all po&s;&s;ible Enquiry after her, &s;ent to all the Neighbouring Villages, &s;earch'd all the publick Roads, but could not receive any account of her. He next &s;ent into <HI>Hartford&s;hire</HI> to her Guardians to know if &s;he was return'd home, but meeting with no &s;atisfaction, concluded that &s;ome young Gentleman who knew &s;he would be a great for|tune had Stole her, and carried her far away to &s;ome di&s;tant County where &s;he lay conceal'd. This the Guardians believed too, till &s;ome of the Neighbors at their Go&s;&s;ipping, were prat|ling what they heard others &s;ay, and began to wi&s;h &s;eriou&s;ly that it was not too true, e&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cial|ly when they con&s;ider'd that if the Child dyed in her Minority, the whole E&s;tate would de|&s;cend to the Uncle.

In this Interval the Uncle ha|ving u&s;ed all the probable means for a di&s;cove|ry that humane Wit could imagine, but not be|ing able to make any, began to think what was to be done, the time of the A&s;&s;ize drew on, and then he &s;hould certainly be Indicted for the Murder of <HI>Joanna,</HI> nor had he any way to clear his Innocence again&s;t &s;uch Circum&s;tantial E|vidence, but by a down-right Negation, which though &s;ome of his Friends might Credit, would yet take no place in a Court of Judicature. Ha|ving thus con&s;idered the difficulty of his Ca&s;e, he at la&s;t re&s;olved thus.

A day or two before the A&s;&s;ize, he gave out he had by great fortune found his Neece, brings her home to his Hou&s;e with her real Father and Mother, who gave a Satisfactory account to all per&s;ons how acci|dently they found her in a wood almo&s;t Starv'd, and She not remembring from whence She had wandred they Entertained her among&s;t their own Children.
