<HEAD>THE LAMENTABLE DEATH OF THE EARLE of BVCQVOY, Generall of the Empe|rours Army. HAPPENED VNTO HIM IN AN Honorable exploit before the Towne of Newheu&s;el.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter that the Emperor had reduced the Kingdome of Bohemia with the three Pro|uinces there|unto belong|ing vnder his obedience, and that both High and low|er Au&s;tria were pacified, &amp; made to ac|knowledge
<PB N="2" REF="3">his Maie&s;ties Soueraignty, and that nothing re&s;ted to be &s;ubdued but Hungaria. The &s;aid Emperour &s;ent the Earle of Bucquoy, his Lieu|tenant Generall, with an Army of Fif|teene Thou&s;and men, to driue Bethlem Gabor out of Hungaria, who hauing taken from him the Towne Edemberg, Presburgh, and the Ca&s;tle, O&s;tia, Filech, and other places. At the la&s;t he planted his Campe before Newheu&s;el, vpon the &s;eauenth of Iune. This place is one of the Forts of mo&s;t importance in higher Hungaria, well fortified with Souldiers, and of all thinges el&s;e that belongeth to with&s;tand a Siege. In the meane time Bethlem (that knewe that the &s;iege be|fore Newheu&s;el would continue long) went to Buda, there to aduance (as it is thought) the great Turkes ayde, (who&s;e de&s;ignes he hath promi&s;ed to execute in Hungaria) and to &s;end 3000. Hungari|ans and Ttan&s;iluanians to releeue New|heu&s;el, which by the way were ouer|throwne
<PB N="3" REF="3">by the Baron de Setchi, &amp; their En&s;ignes &s;ent to Vianna, The Riuer of Taro&s;e was a great hinderance vnto the Earle of Bucquoy to prepare his battery before the Towne, for that thereon hee was forced to erect his mounts to place his Cannon vpon them. But Bethlem that &s;lept not in his de&s;ignes knew well that the lo&s;&s;e of that place, (wherein a part of Bethlems riches and the trea&s;ures of the Lords of Hungary are) would driue him out of the Countrey; hauing receiued a great ayde of Turkes &amp; Tar|tarians, being part of the Turkes great Army &s;ent towards Poland, re&s;olued by all the meanes that hee could v&s;e to en|force Bucquoy to rai&s;e his &s;iege, and if it were pos&s;ible, &s;odainly to &s;urpri&s;e him, before he could receaue any ayde from the Emperor or any other of his friends? and to that end cau&s;ed the Tartarians to march forward, (being a kinde of the mo&s;t inhumane people liuing vpon the face of the earth, men whom no paines
<PB N="4" REF="4">nor labour can weary, and mo&s;t ready and prompt in their de&s;ignes, and much more in their retraicts) who being 6000. men, and Bethlem him&s;elfe following with as many Turks, Tran&s;iluanians, and Hungarians, they &s;odainly &s;et vpon the Emperours army, that be&s;ieged New|heu&s;el on all &s;ides. At which time the Earle of Bucquoy that for&s;ooke not the Campe for feare of the Enemy, (but lea|uing the &s;ignes of an incomparable va|lour behinde him) perceiuing him&s;elfe to be &s;urprized, a&s;well as hee could, ran|ged his men in order of Battaile, being re&s;olued in that extremity not to flie nor yet to bee &s;urprized for want of dexteri|tie, but rather to Fight till he dyed, for the honour of God again&s;t his enemies, and in the Emperours cau&s;e again&s;t his v&s;urpators. The courage of this braue Souldier was not aba&s;hed at the &s;ight of the Turbans and Turki&s;h falchions, nei|ther yet at Bethlems forces, but re&s;olute|ly determined to &s;ell his life deare vnto
<PB N="5" REF="4">them, and that if they tooke it from him, it &s;hould not be &s;o good cheape as they made account of, for to flie he &s;aw it was a thing vnworthy and not fit for the courage of &s;uch a great Commaunder, (who&s;e heart was &s;eated in a higher place) but re&s;olued rather not to liue, after hee &s;hould &s;ee the ouerthrow and di&s;per&s;ing of his Army, and &s;o to be|come a prey vnto his enemies, as al&s;o that he could not otherwi&s;e chu&s;e, ha|uing the enemy both before and behind him: hauing in compari&s;on but a hand|full of men, in regard of the pui&s;&s;ant ayde that came with Bethlem Gabor, he defended him&s;elfe with &s;o great valour, that it was not pos&s;ible to &s;ee a more fu|rious combat, nor a more forcible re&s;i|&s;tance then then was made on both &s;ides, wherein that valiant Captaine al|mo&s;t couered with Arrowes, in the mid|dle of his Souldiers was &s;laine, being thrice &s;hot, and &s;o fell downe to the ground. To the great griefe and &s;orrow
<PB N="6" REF="5">of all his Company, who will neuer for|get the great courage which that valiant Captain &s;hewed in Flaunders in the face of the Hollanders, In Bohemia to the great domage of the Bohemians, and be|fore Prague, at the ouerthrowe of the battaile there fought again&s;t the Prince Palatine. And la&s;tly in Hungaria, before the Hungarian faces.</P>
<P>And although this was a great lo&s;&s;e vnto the Emperour, as al&s;o the re&s;t of his Army by his Death was ouerthrowne, and put to flight, the Siege before New|heu&s;el rai&s;ed, and Bethlem Gabor there|by tryumphed again&s;t them, to the great contentment of the Emperours e|nemies; Neuerthele&s;&s;e, the &s;aid Lords place is already &s;upplyed by three other great Captaines, the Marquis of Tief|fembach, the Earle de Fugger, and the Baron de Prenner, who with great ayde from the Emperour and other Chri&s;tian Princes, hope well to reuenge the death of their Generall.</P>
