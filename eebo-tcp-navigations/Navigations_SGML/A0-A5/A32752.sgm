<P>I Parted from <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> the third of
<HI>March,</HI> 1685. on the King's Ship,
called the <HI>Hawk,</HI> accompanied by
one of His Maje&s;ties Frigats, named the
<HI>Maline,</HI> and that with &s;o favourable a
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Wind, that in &s;even days we arrived at
the <HI>Madera</HI> I&s;lands; we thus happily
pa&s;t on till we came to four or five de|grees
northward of the Equinoctial
line. When we were overtaken by a
calm, and &s;uffered extreme heats, but
which yet did not much incommode us;
the wind began again to blow, and we
pa&s;t the line three hundred and fifty
degrees five minutes of longitude, thir|ty
days after our &s;etting out. We
found the water here to be as fre&s;h
and good, as if it had &s;prang from &s;ome
plea&s;ant fountain, which made us neg|lect
to u&s;e that in our Jarrs. At five
degrees &s;outhward of the line we found
the Winds very incon&s;tant, but the
heats not trouble&s;om, and I left not
off my winter garments in all this pa&s;|&s;age.
The Winds, though variable,
yet carried us our cour&s;e, &s;o that we
arrived at the Cape of Good Hope the
31&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> to take in fre&s;h water,
and other Provi&s;ions, although my old
&s;tore was not exhau&s;ted. We ca&s;t an|chor
late at night, and found in this
road four Dutch Ve&s;&s;els, that came
from <HI>Holland,</HI> and had on Board a Com|mi&s;&s;ioner,
<PB N="3" REF="3">
who was to order affairs in
behalf of the Ea&s;t-India Company.
Mon&s;ieur <HI>St. Martin</HI> Major General, a
French man, who has been in the Dutch
&s;ervice this thirty years, was al&s;o in
one of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, intending for <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI>
where his Employment lay. The
Commi&s;&s;ioner General &s;ent to comple|ment
me the fir&s;t day of my arrival; and
the next morning his Nephew and Se|cretary,
came to offer me what&s;oever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
might want. The Inhabitants of the
Countrey brought pre&s;ents of Fruits
and Cattle; and the Dutch Ve&s;&s;els &s;a|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uted
our Ships after the accu&s;tomed
manner.</P>
<P>The Dutch have here a &s;mall Fort,
and near an hundred Hou&s;es about a
Mu&s;quet &s;hot off it, which are well
built, and in good order. The &s;ituati|on
of this place is very plea&s;ant, al|though
bounded by a great Mountain,
inhabited by an infinite number of Mon|kies,
which oft come down into their
Gardens, and &s;poil the Fruit. There
are al&s;o &s;everal Summer-hou&s;es, two
three and four leagues off in the coun|trey;
and beyond this va&s;t Mountain
<PB N="4" REF="4">
there is plain near ten Leagues long,
where are &s;everal Hou&s;es well inhabi|ted,
and which are every day increa|&s;ing.
The Climate is mild enough&punc;
their Spring beginning in <HI>October,</HI> and
ending in <HI>December,</HI> their Summer la&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<HI>January&punc; February</HI> and <HI>March,</HI> their
Autumn is in <HI>April, May, June,</HI> and
their Winter in <HI>July, Augu&s;t, Septem|ber;</HI>
the heats would be very great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
were they not moderated by gentle
Gales. The Dutch Ea&s;t-India Compa|ny
have here a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Garden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
who&s;e great Walk is fourteen hundred
paces long, it is planted every where
thick with Citron Trees: This Garden
is ordered into Apartments; in one
of them you may &s;ee Fruit-trees, and
the rare&s;t Plants of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> in the other
the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite of <HI>Africa,</HI> in the
third &s;uch as are choice&s;t in <HI>Europe&punc;</HI>
and in the fourth &s;uch Fruits and Plant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
as grow in <HI>America.</HI> This Garden is
very well kept, and of good u&s;e to the
Dutch, by a great quantity of Herb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and Roots which it &s;upplies them with
for the Refre&s;hment of their Fleets,
when they come here to pa&s;s to the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<HI>Indies,</HI> or returning to their own Coun|trey.</P>
<P>I found there a French Gardiner;
who had heretofore learnt his Trade
at the Gardens of Mon&s;ieur at <HI>St. Cloud.</HI>
The Soil is very good, and yields good
&s;tore of grain. A per&s;on, worthy cre|dit,
has a&s;&s;ured me he &s;aw an hundred
and &s;ixty Ears of Corn on one &s;talk.
The Inhabitants of the Countrey have
fair Countenances, but herein deceit|full,
for they are mere bruits; they
go naked, excepting that part which
they cover with a na&s;ty Skin of a bea&s;t.
They till not the Ground, yet abound
with Cattel, &s;uch as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ows, Hogs
and Sheep. They &s;carce eat any of
the&s;e, their chiefe&s;t dyet being Milk
and Butter, which, for cleanline&s;s
&s;ake, they make in Sheep Skins. They
have a root which hath the ta&s;te of
the Kernel of one of our &s;mall Nuts,
which &s;erves them for bread. They
are indifferently skilled in Simples,
which they can u&s;e in the Cure of
Wounds, and other Di&s;tempers. The
greate&s;t Lords among&s;t them, are they
that have mo&s;t Cattle, which they
<PB N="6" REF="5">
watch and keep them&s;elves. They of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
have wars with each other about their
pa&s;tures. Are greatly annoyed with
wild Bea&s;ts, there being more than a
few Lions, Leopards, Tygers, Wolves&punc;
wild Dogs, Elephants, and other &s;a|vage
Creatures. All their Arms are
a kind of poi&s;oned Lance, to &s;trike
the&s;e Bea&s;ts with. They have a kind
of Toyls wherewith they enclo&s;e their
Cattel at night: They trouble not
them&s;elves much about Religion, yet
ob&s;erve &s;ome &s;light Ceremonies to the
Full-moon, which do not &s;ignifie much.
Their Language &s;eems difficult to be
under&s;tood. They have much game,
as Phea&s;ants, Partridges, three or four
&s;orts, Peacocks, Hares, Coneys, and
Deer in &s;uch abundance, that &s;ome|times
a Man &s;hall &s;ee near twenty thou|&s;and
together in a plain. We ate &s;ome
of the&s;e before mentioned, and found
them admirable good. The Sheep are
here very large, of four&s;core pound
weight commonly. Here are great
quantity of Cows and Oxen. The Sea
in this Bay is full of Fi&s;h, which are of
good reli&s;h, &s;ome of them having the
<PB N="7" REF="5">
ta&s;te of Salmon. This place abounds
with Sea-wolves, and when in our Shal|lop
we perceived an infinite number
came tumbling by us, of which we
could not kill one. Several wild Hor&s;es
&s;camper along the plains, which, if I
mi&s;take not, are inferiour to none in
other parts, both in &s;trength, and beau|tifull
colours and &s;hapes; I brought
along with me one of their Skins;
they are hard to be ma&s;tered. This
being &s;uch a good Countrey, the <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
&s;end continually fre&s;h people to
it, who make every &s;ea&s;on con&s;idera|ble
di&s;coveries. Some &s;ay they have
found out Gold and Silver Mines; of
which 'tis not to be expected they
&s;hould &s;ay much them&s;elves. The wa|ter
is here very good, proceeding from
&s;everal Springs, near Rivers which a|bound,
as I already noted, with Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>We parted from this Road the &s;e|venth
of <HI>June,</HI> with &s;o favourable a
North Wind, and North North We&s;t,
that we &s;oon got into the open Sea,
and that night &s;teered to <HI>Bantam:</HI> we
endured vehement Rains, and met with
great Seas, till we reached the I&s;les of
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<HI>Madega&s;car,</HI> which was on the &s;even|teenth
of <HI>June.</HI> On the&s;e Seas you per|ceive
great quantity of Birds, but find
therein no Fi&s;h. Till <HI>July</HI> we encoun|tred
with boi&s;terous Seas, and met with
variable Winds, which forced us forty
degrees &s;outhward, where we found a
We&s;tern Wind, with which we made
great way. The twenty fourth the
<HI>Maline</HI> Frigat was &s;eparated from us
by bad weather, being driven to the
North. The third of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> we found
the Sea le&s;s trouble&s;ome, and the wea|ther
more favourable, and at break of
day di&s;covered an I&s;land &s;even or eight
leagues before us, which &s;urpri&s;ed us,
it not being de&s;cribed in our Chart; It
is &s;ituated ten degrees nineteen minutes
of latitude Southward. This I&s;le lies
convenient for the finding of the I&s;le of
<HI>Java,</HI> which cannot be di&s;tant from it
above an hundred and fifty Leagues,
and &s;ince we under&s;tood 'tis called the
I&s;le of <HI>Money,</HI> being ill &s;et down in
our Maps, which place it near that of
<HI>Java.</HI> This I&s;le lies very high; we
coa&s;ted yet two days with a good gale,
and on the fifth about eight in the mor|ning,
<PB N="9" REF="6">
we di&s;covered the I&s;le of <HI>Java</HI>
which gave us much more Joy, and the
&s;eventh following we found our &s;elves
between the Princes I&s;le, and that of
the Emperour, which make the en|trance
of the Straits. The I&s;le of the
Emperour lies on the &s;ide of <HI>Sumatra,</HI>
and the I&s;le of the Prince on the &s;ide of
<HI>Java.</HI> We lay four days between the&s;e
I&s;lands, the Winds and Streams oppo|&s;ing
us in &s;o violent a manner, that
what we gained in twelve hours, we
lo&s;t in four, by means of calms, which
often happened. Before we entred this
Strait, the Frigat which lo&s;t us on the
twenty fourth of <HI>June,</HI> came up to our
Ship &s;ide this day, before we knew who
&s;he was. The thirteenth we left the&s;e
I&s;lands behind us, and ca&s;t Anchor
within a League of <HI>Java.</HI> There came
on board us &s;everal per&s;ons in little
Boats, who brought us the Countrey
Fruits, &s;uch as Coco's, the water which
is contained in them being excellent
drink, as al&s;o Melons, Citrons, and &s;e|veral
otherlike Pre&s;ents, which much
refre&s;ht our Men, tired with the fa|tigues
<PB N="10" REF="7">
of the Sea, and over-run with
the Scurvy.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth in the morning we
came to <HI>Bantam,</HI> where I found the <HI>Ma|line</HI>
Frigat, which tarried For me two
days: The Captain of it came and
told me, that the Governour of the
place would not give him entrance,
but onely pre&s;ented him with &s;ome
Fowl and Fruits: whereupon I &s;ent
Mr. <HI>De Forbin,</HI> my Lieutenant, to com|pliment
this Governour from me, and
entreat him to grant me leave to land
my &s;ick Men, to take in fre&s;h water,
and other nece&s;&s;aries. He returned
an&s;wer, he was not the Ma&s;ter of <HI>Ban|tam,</HI>
and that there was a King of the
place, who would not admit any &s;tran|ger
to his Countrey. The <HI>Hollanders</HI>
make u&s;e of this King's Name, being
unwilling that &s;trange Ve&s;&s;els &s;hould
come among&s;t them, e&s;pecially the Eu|ropeans.
Since they have &s;ettled there,
they have driven all other Nations out.
'Tis a great Town, and well peopled
by the Natives, before the <HI>Hollanders</HI>
became Ma&s;ters of it, 'twas the chiefe&s;t
place of the <HI>Indies</HI> for Commerce, peo|ple
<PB N="11" REF="7">
came there from <HI>Europe, Per&s;ia,
China, Japon,</HI> the Great <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Coun|trey,
and divers other parts, but now
the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have got all into their
Hands, which is of va&s;t advantage to
them; for this place may be compared
to what heretofore was <HI>Cales</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI>
As &s;oon as I received the Governour's
An&s;wer, who yet told me, that if I
would go to <HI>Batavia,</HI> I &s;hould find
there a kind reception, I therefore
weighed Anchor, and &s;et &s;ail for that
place, to which there's but fifteen
Leagues. I was three days before I ar|rived
there; for having no Pilot that
was acquainted with tho&s;e parts, I fell
on &s;everal I&s;lands, which cau&s;ed me to
ca&s;t Anchor every night, and in the
day time to move with &s;mall &s;ail, &s;oun|ding
all places I went over; but I arri|ved
on the thirteenth at night, where
a&s;&s;oon as I had ca&s;t Anchor, I &s;ent my
Lieutenant to the General, to comple|ment
him, and to de&s;ire leave to bring
my &s;ick Men on &s;hoar, and take in re|fre&s;hments.
He took my Complement
in good part, and returned an&s;wer, he
would take care I &s;hould be &s;atisfied. I
<PB N="12" REF="8">
&s;ent next morning &s;ixty five &s;ick Men
on &s;hoar, who all recovered their
healths in &s;even days that I tarried at
<HI>Batavia.</HI> On the nineteenth in the
morning the General &s;ent me a Comple|ment
by three Officers, the Summ of
which was to de&s;ire me to come on
&s;hoar, offering me his own Hou&s;e to
lodge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> in. After nece&s;&s;ary Thanks, I
an&s;wered, I wi&s;hed my Orders would
have permitted me that Liberty. The
General &s;ent me a great Shalop, laden
with all &s;orts of Indian Fruits, Herbs,
new Bread, two Oxen, two Sheep, and
thus continued for &s;everal days pre&s;en|ting
us. On the twenty &s;econd I lan|ded
<HI>incognito,</HI> and viewed the Town in
a &s;mall Boat. 'Tis like <HI>Venice,</HI> having
Chanels which run through every &s;treet,
and planted with great Trees which
yield an agreeable &s;hade, as well to the
Chanels as the Streets; the Hou&s;es are
built as they are in <HI>Holland;</HI> there is a
Citadel indifferently well fortified; the
Town in enclo&s;ed with a Wall, and
great Ditch, but not deep. The Hou|&s;es
round about it are extreme plea&s;ant,
being related to curious Gardens, and
<PB N="13" REF="8">
Fi&s;h-ponds, wherein are admirable Fi&s;h
of all &s;orts. In this Town the Traders
are exceeding rich, and &s;pare no co&s;t

them&s;elves unlawfull &s;atisfaction
with Women. I took the liberty my
&s;elf to entertain four or five of them
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t divers times, in my walks in the gar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ens;
their dre&s;&s;es are like the French.
There is in <HI>Batavia</HI> about fifty Coaches,
&s;ome of which are very &s;tately; their
Hor&s;es are none of the bigge&s;t, but to
make amends, are in &s;o good plight,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hat they need no &s;pur. This Town
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s a place of va&s;t Commerce, and its
Riches are &s;o great, that the Inhabi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ants
need not be &s;paring of their Mo|ney;
'tis well peopled, and the Dutch
keep a &s;trong Gari&s;on; they have there
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ear three thou&s;and Moors, who are
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">laves, and &s;everal of the Natives they

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">bout the Town. The I&s;le of <HI>Java,</HI> in
which this City is &s;ituated, is very po|pulous,
contains two hundred Leagues
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n length, and forty in breadth; it has
five Kings, over whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI>

&s;ent to the General for a Pilot for <HI>Siam,</HI>
mine having never been there; he lent
me one who had &s;ailed there four times;
for the&s;e civilities, I &s;ent Mr. <HI>Forbin</HI> to
thank him.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday,</HI> being the twenty &s;ixth
of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at &s;ix of the Clock in the
morning, we &s;et &s;ail, and &s;teered our
cour&s;e to pa&s;s the Strait of <HI>Banca;</HI> we
advanced that day ten Leagues with a
&s;mall Wind, and at nine at night I was
told of a Sail that made towards my
Ve&s;&s;el, whereupon I bid the Officer be
prepared; when immediately I &s;aw out
of my Window this Ship coming up to
us: we called out to know what &s;he
was, but could have no an&s;wer, and
coming on the Deck, I found all our
Men provided for her, and the Bolt-&s;prit
of this Ship laid on cro&s;s my
Stern, I cau&s;ed about twenty Mu&s;quet
Shot to be fired among her Men, which
immediately made her clear her &s;elf
of us, and taking the advantage of the
Wind, and clapping on all her Sails,
we knew not what Nation &s;he was of,
for no body in the Ship &s;poke one
word, and we ob&s;erved but few Men on
<PB N="15" REF="9">
board her. I &s;uppo&s;e her to have been
&s;ome Merchant Ship, guided by unskil|full
hands; they did our Ship &s;ome
mi&s;chief, but the damage was repaired
next morning.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day,</HI> being the twenty eighth,
at night we di&s;covered the entrance of
the Strait of <HI>Banca,</HI> and on the twenty
ninth in the morning we entred there|in.
Although we had a good Dutch
Pilot, yet we ran upon a muddy bank
of Sand, there being many of this kind
in this Strait, and ti being u&s;ual for
Ve&s;&s;els to meet with them without
much hurt, therefore this did not much
di&s;turb us, for I cau&s;ed a &s;mall Anchor
to be ca&s;t on the &s;ide of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and
in le&s;s than two hours we got off clear
from this Bank. We were three days
pa&s;&s;ing this Strait. The I&s;le of <HI>Suma|tra</HI>
is on the left, and contains two
hundred and fifty Leagues in length,
and about fifty in breadth. The <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
have four or five Fortre&s;&s;es here,
its people are Mahometans, and under
the Regiment of five or &s;ix Kings. The
Queen of <HI>Achem</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es one of the lar|ge&s;t
Countries, and governs with great
<PB N="16" REF="10">
Authority and Regularity. The <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
are in a manner Ma&s;ters of all
the&s;e Princes, they deal with them for
what&s;oever the I&s;land yields, where 'tis
&s;aid there are golden Mines, great
quantities of Pepper, Rice, all &s;orts of
Cattle, and in &s;ome Cantons the peo|ple
are very barbarous, and the Kings
are oft at war one with one another.
Tho&s;e who receive the <HI>Hollanders</HI> pro|tection
are ever the &s;tronge&s;t: 'Tis the
&s;ame in the I&s;le of <HI>Java,</HI> for three hun|dred
Europeans do beat five or &s;ix thou|&s;and
Men of the&s;e Nations, who know
not tho Art of War. It lies four de|grees
Southward of the Equinoctial
Line. The Dutch have a Fort on the
&s;ide of the Strait of <HI>Banca,</HI> &s;trengthe|ned
with twenty four pieces of Canon;
the Fort is built upon the River called
<HI>Palembone,</HI> which runs &s;o violently into
the Sea, that three or four months in
the year, in rainy weather, the water
of it, when in the Sea, does yet keep
its fre&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>Banca</HI> lay on the right
hand of us, being about fourty Leagues
long; The Dutch have a Fort there,

and drive a con&s;iderable Trade with
the Natives of the Countrey; 'tis &s;aid
to be a very good and fruitfull Coun|trey,
when I &s;ailed by the River of <HI>Pa|lembone,</HI>
the Dutch were there lading
two Ve&s;&s;els with Pepper. On the third
of <HI>September</HI> we pa&s;t the Line again by
the help of good weather, the air be|ing
temperate, and without exce&s;&s;ive
Heats, &s;o that I &s;till wore my Cloth
&s;uit, till I pa&s;t over to the Coa&s;ts of
<HI>Africa.</HI> We came before the Strait of
<HI>Malaca,</HI> which has four or five pa&s;&s;a|ges,
or entrances, but the Streams were
&s;o great, and running &s;ometimes again&s;t
us, that we were forced oft to ca&s;t An|thor;
for when the Calm took us, the
Streams forcibly carried us a great di|&s;tance;
but we left not this Coa&s;t, by
rea&s;on of the Winds, which always
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">low from the land, and greatly hel|ped
us in our cour&s;e. I believe this
Countrey's Air to be good, for we had
many &s;ick, who were all recovered by
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</P>
<P>On the fifth we di&s;covered the I&s;le
of <HI>Polimon,</HI> which is inhabited by <HI>Ma|lai&s;es,</HI>
who are Mahometans. This is a
<PB N="18" REF="11">
plentifull Countrey, and obedient to a
Prince by whom 'tis governed. The
Queen of <HI>Achem</HI> has &s;ome preten&s;ions to
it, and for this effect &s;he &s;ends thither
every year &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els; but this Prince
being not willing to engage in a War
again&s;t her, his people pay her Tribute.
There came a &s;mall Boat to our Ship
&s;ide, which brought us &s;ome Fi&s;h and
Fruits. This I&s;le is di&s;tant from the
Continent about &s;ix Leagues, part of
its Coa&s;ts was heretofore &s;ubject to the
King of <HI>Siam;</HI> but it has been &s;ince
&s;ome years in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of two or
three Kings, one of which is the King
of <HI>Malais.</HI> This is a very un&s;ociable
Nation, and will enter into no Com|merce.</P>
<P>From the fifth to the fifteenth we had
but &s;mall Winds, and very variable, and
Calms which cau&s;ed us oft to ca&s;t An|chor,
as al&s;o by rea&s;on of Streams which
run along this Coa&s;t. From the Strait
of <HI>Banca</HI> to <HI>Siam</HI> the Land is not wont
to be left.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day we found our &s;elves
before <HI>Ligor,</HI> which is the chief place
belonging to the King of <HI>Siam.</HI> The
<PB N="19" REF="11">
<HI>Hollanders</HI> have a habitation there, and
liberty of Trade. 'Tis hard to ex|pre&s;s
the Joy which the <HI>Siamoi&s;es</HI> whom
we brought along with us had to &s;ee
their own Countrey, and it cannot be
better compared than to that which
we felt at our return, when God
brought us &s;afe to <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI> Here died
a young Gentleman having been ill
five months with a bloudy Flux, whom
the King &s;ent to attend me in my
Voyage, he was a Youth of great hopes,
and I was much afflicted at the lo&s;s of
him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort (thanks be to God) on the
twenty fourth we ca&s;t Anchor before
the River of <HI>Siam.</HI> Our whole Ship's
crew were in good health. I &s;ent to the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis</HI> Mr. <HI>le Vacher</HI> a
Mi&s;&s;ionary, who came with the <HI>Man|darins</HI>
into <HI>France,</HI> and whom I brought
along with them, with charge to en|treat
him to come to me that I might
learn what had happened this eighteen
months &s;ince the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ent
into <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>On the twenty ninth the Bi&s;hop
came on board with the Abbat of
<PB N="20" REF="12">
<HI>Lionne,</HI> who informed me of what&s;oever
had pa&s;t, telling me that the King of
<HI>Siam</HI> having heard at midnight of my
arrival by Mr. <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> one of his
Mini&s;ters, he &s;hewed great joy, and
ordered him to go and adverti&s;e the
Bi&s;hop of it, and to di&s;patch two <HI>Man|darins</HI>
of the fir&s;t rank, who are in a
manner as the chief Gentlemen of the
King's Chamber are in <HI>France,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure
me of the joy he conceived at my ar|rival.
They came two days after on
board me, whom I received in my
Cabin; the Bi&s;hop &s;itting by me, and
they and others &s;itting down on Carpets
laid on the floor, it being the cu&s;tome
of the Country to &s;it in that manner,
there being no per&s;on but the King
who &s;its higher.</P>
<P>They told me the King their Ma&s;ter
had commanded them to &s;hew me the
Joy he had at my arrival, and at the
News of our King's having vanqui&s;hed
all his Enemies, and become ab&s;olute
Ma&s;ter of his Kingdom. Having de|noted
to them how much I thought
my &s;elf beholden to the King their
Ma&s;ter, and an&s;wered what they of|fered
<PB N="21" REF="12">
touching our Prince, I told them
I was extremely &s;atisfied with the
Governor of <HI>Bancok,</HI> for his reception
of tho&s;e I &s;ent him, as al&s;o with the
Pre&s;ents he had made me. They reply|ed
he had done onely his duty, &s;eeing
in <HI>France</HI> the King their Ma&s;ter's Envoys
had been &s;o well received, and that
moreover I merited this good u&s;age by
my procurement of an Union between
the Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> and of <HI>France.</HI>
Having treated them with the honours
and civilities u&s;ual in &s;uch like occa&s;ions
in the&s;e Countries, I pre&s;ented them
with Tea and Comfits. The&s;e two
<HI>Mandarins</HI> were well &s;hap'd Men, of
about 25 years of Age, and Apparelled
after their mode, being bare headed,
without Shoes or Stockings, wearing
a kind of long Scarf down to their
Knees and coming between their Legs
was fa&s;tned behind. This Scarf was
of painted linen neatly done, and em|broidred
at the edges; from the wa&s;te
upwards, they had nothing but a kind
of Mu&s;lin wa&s;tcoat, which they let
hang over this Scarf, the &s;leeves being
&s;omewhat large, but not long. They
<PB N="22" REF="13">
remained about an hour on board our
Ve&s;&s;el, and I &s;aluted them with nine
pieces of Canon at their departure.</P>
<P>On the ninth of <HI>October</HI> Mr. <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI>
the King of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Mini&s;ter I lately
mentioned, and who though a &s;tranger,
has obtained by his merit the chief
place in the King's favour, &s;ent to
Complement me by his Secretary who
was an hone&s;t man, and offered me from
him&s;elf &s;uch a great pre&s;ent of Fruits,
be&s;ides Oxen, Hoggs, Pullets, Ducks
and &s;uch like things, that all the Ships
crew were fed with them for four days
together. The&s;e refre&s;hments are
gratefull when a man has been &s;even
or eight months at Sea.</P>
<P>On the eighth the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metel|lopolis</HI>
who had returned to the chief
City of <HI>Siam,</HI> came on board us again
with two <HI>Mandarin's</HI> to enquire as
from the King after my Health, and
to inform me how impatiently he took
my delays of &s;eeing him, entreating
me to ha&s;ten on &s;hore. I returned their
Complement, and told them I &s;hould
&s;oon be there. I gave the&s;e <HI>Manda|rins</HI>
the &s;ame Entertainment I gave the
<PB N="23" REF="13">
fir&s;t, &s;aluting them al&s;o at their depar|ture
with nine pieces of Canon. About
two of the Clock the &s;ame day I went
into my Shalop, and tho&s;e of my At|tendance
into Boats which the King had
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ent; being arrived at night in the
River, I found five Barges, one for my
&s;elf, which was a very magnificent one,
and the four others for the Gentlemen
which accompanied me, with &s;everal
others to carry the re&s;t of my Retinue
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Goods. Two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> could not reach that night the place

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ntred the River two days before, on

<P>The &s;ame Evening a per&s;on whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
had &s;ent to <HI>Siam</HI> to buy &s;uch Pro|vi&s;ions
as we needed, came and told
me that Mr. <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> had delivered to
him from the King eleven Barks full
of Oxen, Sheep, Calves, Ducks, Pul|lets
and Strong-water made with
Rice, together with a Reque&s;t that I
would not &s;pare to ask for what we

wanted, for we &s;hould be &s;upplye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
all the time we tarryed in the King|dom,
at his Maje&s;ty's charge.</P>
<P>On the ninth there came two <HI>Man|darins</HI>
to my Barge from the King, who
told me they came for my orders, and
I parted from this place about &s;even i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the morning. Having went about fiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

purpo&s;e for my entertainment, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">
two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and the Governour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

Meats and delicate Fruits. I left thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
place after Dinner, and all the <HI>Man|darins</HI>
followed me. I went to <HI>Bancok</HI>
which is the chief place the King <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<HI>Siam</HI> has on this River, di&s;tant abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
twelve leagues from the Sea. I foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="25" REF="14">
here an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which &s;aluted
me with his Cannon, which were an|&s;wered
by the Forts which defend
both &s;ides of the River; which Forts
are regular enough, and well furni&s;hed
with Guns. I lodged in a Hou&s;e well
built and furni&s;ht, where I was treated
after the fa&s;hion of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The next Morning I parted at eight of
the clock attended by all the <HI>Mandarins</HI>
and Governours who were come to
complement me. At my departure I
was al&s;o &s;aluted by the Cannon, and
arrived at Noon in a Hou&s;e built on
purpo&s;e for me, and as well furni&s;ht
as the former. There was near ad|joyning
two Fortre&s;&s;es which &s;aluted
me with all their Guns, and two <HI>Man|darins</HI>
more came to receive me. I
was very well &s;erved at Dinner; and
I parted here at three a clock, and
the Governour of <HI>Bancok</HI> took his
leave of me to return to his charge.
Holding on my cour&s;e I came to two
Ships the one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the other
<HI>Dutch</HI> lying at anchor, who al&s;o di&s;|charged
all their Cannon, and I arrived
at &s;even at night at a convenient Hou&s;e
<PB N="26" REF="15">
furni&s;hed after the &s;ame manner as the
preceding ones, where I was received
and treated by other <HI>Mandarins.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh in the morning I par|ted
thence, and went and dined in
another Hou&s;e, and at night I lay and
was treated as before.</P>
<P>On the twelfth I lodged two Leagues
off of <HI>Siam,</HI> where I was again recei|ved
by two <HI>Mandarins.</HI> The princi|pal
Merchants of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
Companies came to complement my
arrival in tho&s;e parts, and as to the
<HI>French</HI> they attended me all the way. 
Here I remained till I made my en|trance.</P>
<P>The River of <HI>Siam</HI> called <HI>Menon</HI> is
very large and commodious, being
adorned all along the &s;ides of it with
plea&s;ant Trees; but three or four
months in the Year all the&s;e places
are overflowed with water, and there|fore
all the Hou&s;es are built on a kind
of &s;ledges, and made all of <HI>Bamboos.</HI>
This wood &s;erves the <HI>Siamoi&s;es</HI> both
for the foundations and tops of their
hou&s;es, and for infinite purpo&s;es be|&s;ides,
making u&s;e of it as we do
<PB N="27" REF="15">
Flints and Steels, for they need onely
take a little of this wood on a heap,
and rub it together, and it pre&s;ently
lights. All the people of the&s;e parts
have little Boats to pa&s;s from one
hou&s;e to another for what they want.
Here are &s;een none but Women to
work, the Men being for the mo&s;t part
employed in the Kings &s;ervice, who&s;e
Slaves they are. I had the &s;ame honours
&s;hewed me, as to the King when he is
wont to pa&s;s on the River. I could
&s;ee no body in the hou&s;es, all people
were in Barges, or on the &s;ide of the
River, lying flat on their Bellies, and
their hands joyned again&s;t their fore|heads.
They reverence in &s;uch a
manner their Prince, that they dare
not lift up their eyes to look on him.
I ob&s;erved that the hou&s;es where I
lodged were painted with red, that I
might be treated as his own per&s;on,
there being onely the Royal Hou&s;es
of that colour.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Mandarins</HI> which came to
receive me on the River, &s;till accom|panied
me. The Princes al&s;o vi&s;ited
me. They have all convenient Barges,
<PB N="28" REF="16">
in the middle of which there is a kind
of Throne whereon they &s;it, and they
u&s;ually go but one in a Barge, on both
&s;ides of them are their Arms, as Scimi|tars,
Swords and Darts, and even Forks.
They are all cloathed in the manner
I already mentioned. A <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
whom the King had made General
of the Troops in <HI>Bancok</HI> continually
accompanied me, and gave orders for
all things. I was attended with near
fifty or &s;ixty Barges, &s;ome of which
were fifty, &s;ixty, &s;eventy and eighty
foot long&punc; having Oars from twenty
to an hundred. They row not after
our manner, they &s;it two on each bench,
one on one &s;ide and another on the
other, their Faces turned on that &s;ide
where they go, and have a Scul which
they call <HI>Pagais,</HI> being about four foot
long, with which they take a world
of pains, being contented with &s;od
Rice, and if they have a piece of Fi&s;h,
they believe they Dine &s;umptuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>They eat of a Leaf which they call
<HI>Betel,</HI> which is like Ivy, and a kind of
Corn which they call <HI>Arrek,</HI> putting
Lime thereon, and this gives it a ta&s;te.
<PB N="29" REF="16">
They eat the Tobacco growing in
their Countrey, which is very &s;trong,
all which blackens their Teeth, which
they e&s;teem the hand&s;ome&s;t. A man
may live after this rate for fifteen
pence a month for they u&s;ually drink
nothing but water. They have a kind
of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> which they call <HI>Rack,</HI>
made with Rice. When I came to a
Hou&s;e which was intended for me,
all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> that accompanied me
made a lane for me to pa&s;s through to
my Chamber door.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth I &s;ent word to
the King by the <HI>Mandarins</HI> that were
with me, that I had been informed of
the manner wherewith they were wont
to receive Amba&s;&s;adors, and it being
very different from that of <HI>France,</HI>
I entreated him to &s;end me &s;omebody
to in&s;truct me about my entrance.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth he &s;ent me the Sieur
<HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> with whom I had a long con|ver&s;ation,
the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metropolis</HI>
being our Interpreter. We had a tedi|ous
di&s;pute, and I would bate nothing of
the mode of receiving Amba&s;&s;adors in
<HI>France,</HI> which at length he granted me.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="17">
On the fifteenth the <HI>Tunquinoi&s;es</HI> came
to complement me on my arrival.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth the <HI>Cochinchinoi&s;es</HI> did
the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;eventeenth Mr. <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> came
to me, and brought with him four
&s;tately Barges to carry the Pre&s;ents
which his Maje&s;ty &s;ent to the King of
<HI>Siam.</HI> And on the &s;ame day the King
gave order to all the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations
that re&s;ide at <HI>Siam,</HI> to congratulate
my arrival, and to pay me all the
e&s;pect which is due to the character
of an Amba&s;&s;ador to &s;o great a King.
They came to me at &s;ix at night,
each of them habited after their own
manner; there were of forty different
Nations, and each of them of King|doms
independent one of another, and
that which &s;eemed mo&s;t remarkable,
was that among the re&s;t there was the
&s;on of a King who was driven out of
his Countrey, and taking <HI>Siam</HI> for
his refuge, entreated a&s;&s;i&s;tance toward
his re-e&s;tabli&s;hment; their dre&s;&s;es were
the &s;ame as the <HI>Siamoi&s;es,</HI> &s;ome ha|ving
Turbants, others <HI>Armenian</HI> Bon|nets,
and others bare-headed, like the
<PB N="31" REF="17">
common <HI>Siamoi&s;es;</HI> per&s;ons of quality
having Bonnets of the &s;ame fa&s;hion of
our Dragoons, made of white Mu&s;lin
which tye under their Chins with a
&s;tring, being all of them barefooted.</P>
<P>The King made Mr. <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> tell
me, that he would give me Audience
the next morning, being the eighteenth.
I &s;et out at &s;even of the clock in the
morning in the manner which I &s;hall
relate, having fir&s;t recited the honour
wherewith the King of <HI>Siam</HI> received
the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Letter. 'Tis true
he is wont to receive with re&s;pect the
Letters delivered him by Amba&s;&s;adors
of foreign Potentates, but he would
give a di&s;tinct honour to that of our
great Monarch. There came forty of the
chiefe&s;t <HI>Mandarins</HI> in the Court, two of
which were <HI>Oyas,</HI> which is to &s;ay Dukes,
who told me that all the Barges were
ready to receive his Maje&s;ty's Letter,
and carry my &s;elf to the Palace.
The Letter was in my Chamber in
a golden Cabinet; the <HI>Mandarins</HI> ha|ving
entred pro&s;trated them&s;elves,
their hands clo&s;ed and adjoyning to
their foreheads, and their faces to|wards
<PB N="32" REF="18">
the ground, and &s;aluted in this
po&s;ture the King's Letter for three
times together. I being &s;eated on a
Throne near the Letter, received this
honour, which was never paid to any
but his Maje&s;ty of <HI>France,</HI> which Ce|remony
being ended, I took the Let|ter
with the golden Cabinet, and ha|ving
carried it &s;even or eight paces,
I gave it to the Abbat of <HI>Choi&s;y,</HI>
who came from <HI>France</HI> with me. He
walkt at my right hand a little behind,
and carried it to the water &s;ide,
where I found a curious Barge, &s;ump|tuou&s;ly
gilded, in which were two
<HI>Mandarins</HI> of the chief rank. I took
the Letter from Mr. <HI>Choi&s;y,</HI> and ha|ving
carried it into the Barge with
me, I put it into the hands of the&s;e
<HI>Mandarins,</HI> who laid it on a &s;tately
rai&s;ed Table gilt; I entred into ano|ther,
a very magnificent one, which
followed immediately that wherein
was the Letter of his Maje&s;ty. Two
others al&s;o as &s;tately as mine, in which
were <HI>Mandarins,</HI> rowed on either &s;ide
of that where the Letter was. Mine,
as I now &s;aid, followed after Mr. <HI>Choi&s;y,</HI>
<PB N="33" REF="18">
the Abbat was in another Barge next
to mine, and the Gentlemen which
accompanied me, and others of my re|tinue
in other Barges: Tho&s;e of the
Great <HI>Mandarins</HI> likewi&s;e were very
fine, and were on head of us. There
were about twelve gilt Barges, and near
two hundred others that followed us.
The King's Letter, the two Barges that
attended it, and mine, were in the mid|dle.
All the Nations at <HI>Siam</HI> were at|tending,
and the whole River, although
very large, was covered with Barges.
We moved after this rate to the Town,
who&s;e Cannons were di&s;charged, which
never was done to any other Amba&s;&s;a|dour,
all the Ships &s;aluted me likewi&s;e,
and at landing, I found a great golden
Chariot&punc; which onely the King rode in.
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span"> took His Maje&s;ty's Letter, and laid
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> into this Chariot, which was drawn
by Hor&s;es led by Men&punc; I afterwards
went into a glorious Chair, which was
carried by ten Men on their Shoulders;
the Abbat of <HI>Choi&s;y&punc;</HI> was al&s;o in a|nother,
but of le&s;s finery; the Gen|tlemen
and <HI>Mandarins</HI> which accompa|nied
me, were on Hor&s;eback, all the

&s;everal Nations which dwell at <HI>Siam</HI>
walking on foot behind; the Proce&s;&s;ion
was in this wi&s;e to the Ca&s;tle, where
I found the Souldiers, who were drawn
up on each &s;ide of the Street, having
Head-pieces gilt with Gold, red Shirts
on, and a kind of Scarf of painted cloth,
which &s;erved them for Breeches, but
having neither Shoes nor Stockings:
Some of them were armed with Mu&s;|quets,
others with Lances, others with
Bows and Arrows, and la&s;tly, &s;ome
with Pikes.</P>
<P>There wanted not mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments,
as Trumpets, Drums, Tim|brels,
Pipes, little Bells and Horns,
which Mu&s;ick made a plea&s;ant noi&s;e;
and thus marched we the length of a
great Street, through an infinite num|ber
of People. We came at lenght to
a great open place in which &s;tood the
King's Palace, where were ranged on
each &s;ide Elephants of War: We af|terwards
entred into the fir&s;t Court of
the Palace, where I &s;aw about two thou|&s;and
Souldiers in a po&s;ture of &s;itting,
with the Butt-end of their Mu&s;quets to
the ground &s;tanding upright, they were
<PB N="35" REF="19">
placed &s;ix in a rank, in a direct line:
There were on the left &s;everal armed
Elephants, ready for War. We after|wards
&s;aw an hundred Men on Hor&s;e|back,
naked, and clothed after the Moo|ri&s;h
Fa&s;hion, having a Lance in their
Hands; all the Souldiers were accou|tred
as I already mentioned; in this
place tho&s;e of foreign Nations left me,
excepting &s;ome Gentlemen who accom|panied
me all the way. I pa&s;t into two
other Courts which were garri&s;oned af|ter
the &s;ame manner, and I entred in|to
another, where was a great number
of <HI>Mandarins,</HI> all of them pro&s;trate on
the ground; here were &s;ix Hor&s;es held,
each of them by two <HI>Mandarins;</HI> they
were well harne&s;t, all their Trappings
being of Gold and Silver, covered with
Pearls, Rubies and Diamonds, &s;o thick
that a Man could &s;carce &s;ee the leather;
their Stirrups and Saddles were of Gold
and Silver, and the Hor&s;es had golden
Rings on their Feet; there were al&s;o
&s;everal Elephants harne&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame
manner the Coach Hor&s;es were. The
Gentlemen entred into the Hall of Au|dience,
and placed them&s;elves before
<PB N="36" REF="20">
the King came into his Throne, and
when he was there attended with
Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans, du Barcalon,</HI> and the Ab|bat
of <HI>Choi&s;y&punc;</HI> who carried the King's
Letter, I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him on
a higher Throne, for Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> had
agreed with me, that the King &s;hould
be on a Throne no higher than where
I might give my Letter with my own
hand, without &s;training my &s;elf; then
I told the Abbat <HI>de Choi&s;y,</HI> the pro|mi&s;e
they made me was forgotten, but
that I would not give the King my
Letter in this manner; the golden Ca|binet
wherein 'twas put had a great
Handle, three foot long; 'twas imagi|ned
I would take hold on it, thus to rai&s;e
it to the King's Throne, but I was re&s;ol|ved
to pre&s;ent His Maje&s;ty's Letter to
the King in a befitting manner: Being
then come to the Door, I &s;aluted the
King, the like I did al&s;o in the mid
way, and when I was near the place
where I was to &s;it; having uttered
two words of my Harangue, I put my

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE King, my Ma&s;ter, who is now
&s;o famous in the World, by
his great Victories, and the Peace
he has often granted his Enemies at
the head of his Armies, has com|manded
me to come to Your Maje|&s;ty,
to a&s;&s;ure you of the particular
E&s;teem he has for you.</P>
<P>He knows, Sir, Your princely
Qualities, the Wi&s;edom of your Go|vernment,
the Magnificence of your
Court, the Grandeur of your States,
and e&s;pecially the Goodwill You bear
His Per&s;on, demon&s;trated by the

&s;hew His Subjects, e&s;pecially to the
<PB N="38" REF="21">
religious Emi&s;&s;aries who are God's
Amba&s;&s;adors.</P>
<P>He experiences &s;o many marks of
kindne&s;s from you, as makes him
ready to offer the mo&s;t &s;uitable re|turns,
to keep a continual corre&s;pon|dence
with you, to entertain and en|crea&s;e
a Commerce with Your Sub|jects,
but e&s;pecially to begin an Union
between the two Crowns, which will
be the more famous to po&s;terity, by
Your Countrey's lying &s;o di&s;tant
from His, by the va&s;t Seas which &s;e|parate
them.</P>
<P>But nothing will &s;o much keep
Him in this re&s;olution, and more
unite Him to You, than to live to|gether
in the &s;ame Opinions and
Belief.</P>
<P>And this is, Sir, what the King
my Ma&s;ter, who is &s;o wi&s;e and en|lightened
a Prince, and who has ne|ver
failed in his Advice to the Kings
his Allies, has e&s;pecially enjoined me
to recommend to You.</P>
<P>He conjures you, as one of his &s;in|cere&s;t
Friends, and by the Intere&s;t
which he has in your Wellfare, to
<PB N="39" REF="21">
con&s;ider that this &s;upreme Maje&s;ty

&s;uch as the Chri&s;tians acknowledge,
by whom alone Kings do reign, and
who &s;ubdueth the People that are un|der
them. Submit Your Greatne&s;s to
this God, who governs Heaven and

<P>The be&s;t news, Sir, I can carry
home to the King my Ma&s;ter, is, that
Your Maje&s;ty being convinced of the
reality of what I &s;ay, has made far|ther
enquiries into the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,

<P>This Harangue was interpreted by
Monr. <HI>Con&s;tans;</HI> I afterwards told His
Maje&s;ty, that the King my Ma&s;ter
had given me the Abbat <HI>de Chai&s;y,</HI>
and tho&s;e twelve Gentlemen for my
Company, whom I pre&s;ented to him.
I took the Letter from the Hands of
the Abbat <HI>de Choi&s;y,</HI> and carried it in
the de&s;ign of pre&s;enting it, no other|wi&s;e
than I before mentioned, Mr. <HI>Con|&s;tans,</HI>
who accompanied me, crawling
and jumping on his Hands and Feet,
called out to me, and making Signs I
&s;hould &s;tretch out my Arm as well as
the King, I made as if I under&s;tood not
what was told me, when the King, &s;mi|ling,
aro&s;e, and &s;tooped down to take
the Letter out of the Cabinet, and that
in &s;uch a manner as one might &s;ee his
whole Body; a&s;&s;oon as he had taken it,
I made my Obei&s;ance, and retired to my
Seat&punc; The King enquired of the Health
of His Maje&s;ty, and all the Royal Fami|ly,
and whether the King had made any
<PB N="41" REF="22">
Conque&s;t of late, I told him he had
gained <HI>Luxembourg,</HI> an impregnable
place, and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> held in that Countrey, which
&s;hut up the Frontiers of <HI>France,</HI> and
opened a way to tho&s;e who might be|come
his Enemies, and that he had late|ly
agreed to a Peace with all <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
when at the Head of his Armies.
The King replied, he was glad of our
King's Victories, and the Peace he en|joyed;
he added he had &s;ent Amba&s;&s;a|dours
to <HI>France,</HI> who embarked at <HI>Ban|tam,</HI>
in the <HI>Ri&s;ing Sun;</HI> that he would
&s;eek all ways to give the King &s;ati&s;|faction
in every thing I offered him:
The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Metellopolis</HI> was pre&s;ent,
who interpreted &s;everal Que&s;tions the
King made me. This Monarch had a
Crown enriched with Diamonds, fa|&s;tened
on a Cap, which &s;tood up above
the Crown like almo&s;t to our Dragoons,
his Ve&s;t was of a very rich flowered
Stuff, wrought with Gold, and embroi|der'd,
at the Neck and Sleeves with Dia|monds,
which lookt like a kind of Col|lar
and Bracelets. He had a great many
Diamond Rings on his fingers; I can|not
<PB N="42" REF="23">
&s;ay what kind of Shoes or Stocking
he had on, having onely in this Audi|ence
&s;een half his Body. He had four|&s;core
<HI>Mandarins</HI> in his Parlor, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
was, all pro&s;trate on the ground, and
who never left this po&s;ture all this
while.</P>
<P>The King is about fifty five years of
age, well &s;haped, &s;omewhat tanned,
as all of tho&s;e Countreys are, having
a chearfull countenance; his inclinati|ons
are Royal, he is couragious, a great
Politician, governing alone, magnifi|cent,
liberal, a Lover of Arts, in a
word, a Prince, who by his Wit has
freed him&s;elf from diver&s;e Cu&s;tomer
which he found in his Kingdom, bor|rowing
of &s;trange Countreys, and e&s;pe|cially
of <HI>Europe,</HI> what&s;oever he thought
might mo&s;t contribute to the Honour
and Happine&s;s of his Reign.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Mandarins,</HI> whom I now men|tioned,
had neither Shoes nor Stoc|kins,
and were apparelled like tho&s;e I
have heretofore &s;poke of, with Caps,
like the King's, and each of them had a
Box, wherein he put his <HI>Betel, Arreck,</HI>
and Tobacco. By the&s;e Boxes a Man
<PB N="43" REF="23">
may di&s;tingui&s;h their Qualities and
Ranks, &s;ome differing from others. Af|fter
the King had di&s;cour&s;ed with me an
hour, he &s;hut his Window, and I reti|red.
The place of Audience was about
twelve or fifteen &s;teps high, 'twas fine|ly
painted within with flowers of Gold,
from the top to the bottom, the Floor
was covered with rich Tape&s;try; at
the end of this Parlor there were two
pair of large Stairs on each hand, which
led into the Chamber where the King
was, in the middle of the&s;e two pair of
Stairs are Windows to which you mu&s;t
go up &s;ome &s;teps, before which there
were three great Umbrella's, they were
of Cloth of Gold, and their Sticks
painted with Gold, one was in the
middle of the Window, and the two
others on both &s;ides, 'tis through this
Window we &s;aw the King's Throne,
and through which he gave me Audi|ence.
Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> carried me after|wards
to view the re&s;t of the Palace,
where I &s;aw the white Elephant, who
ate and drank out of Gold, I &s;aw al&s;o
others, very fine ones, after which I
returned to my Lodging in the &s;ame
<PB N="44" REF="24">
Pomp wherein I came, which Hou&s;e was
well enough, and all my retinue were
well accommodated in it. I was infor|med
that Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> had given order
from the King to all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
foreign Nations that dwell in his King|dom,
to come to the&s;e Lodgings and
being there he told them the King was
minded they &s;hould &s;ee in what di&s;tinct
manner he treated the Amba&s;&s;adours
of <HI>France,</HI> and tho&s;e of other Nations&punc;
This di&s;tinction being due to the King
of <HI>France,</HI> a mo&s;t mighty Monarch, and
who knew to requite the Civilities
&s;hewed him. The&s;e <HI>Mandarins</HI> were
a&s;toni&s;hed, and an&s;wered, they had ne|ver
&s;een an Amba&s;&s;adour from <HI>France,</HI>
and were per&s;uaded that the &s;ingular re|ception
which the King gave him was
due to the Character of &s;o great a
Prince, &s;eeing his Victories have long
&s;ince been known to the remote&s;t parts
of the World; and therefore they were
not &s;urpri&s;ed at the King's di&s;tinction.
At the &s;ame time Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> ordered
them from the King to come and com|plement
me.</P>

<P>On the ninteenth there came a great

Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> with a Pre&s;ent of Fruits,

the King's cu&s;tome being to pre&s;ent at
one's arrival Stuffs wherewith to make
Cloaths after the fa&s;hion of the Coun|trey:
But as for my part I made no new
Cloaths, and there were onely the
Gentlemen of my train, who did it:
At night being accompained by the

the Elephants were tyed by the two

Hor&s;es are managed by a bridle, they
&s;truck them &s;everal times to animate
them, and the Elephants had fought
well no que&s;tion, had they had liberty,
they onely gave one another blows
with their teeth and trunks; the King
was there pre&s;ent, but I did not &s;ee
him: We pa&s;t through this Court into
&s;everal others, and afterwards came
into the <HI>Pagod,</HI> the Portal appeared
to be ancient and well wrought, the
whole building indifferent hand&s;ome,
and of the form of our Churches in
<HI>Europe;</HI> we &s;aw &s;everal Statues of Bra&s;s
gilt which &s;eemed to offer &s;acrifices
to a great Idol all of Gold, about
forty foot high, on the &s;ide of which
Idol, there were &s;everal other &s;mall
ones, &s;ome of which being al&s;o of
Gold, had lighted Lamps fa&s;tned
into them, from the top to the bottom
of them. At the end of this <HI>Pagod,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="26">
there is another great Idol on a &s;tately
Tombe&s;tone: I afterwards went into a|nother
<HI>Pagod</HI> adjoyning to the fir&s;t,

which the <HI>Talapoins,</HI> which are the
Prie&s;ts of <HI>Siam,</HI> do light every night.
In this <HI>Pagod</HI> was the Tomb of the
decea&s;ed Queen who died about four
or five years &s;ince; 'tis magnificent
enough, and behind this Tomb, was
another of this pre&s;ent King's Prede|ce&s;&s;or's,
repre&s;ented by a great Statue
lying on one &s;ide and dre&s;t as Kings
are wont to be in days of Ceremony;
this Statue is about twenty five foot
long, 'twas of Bra&s;s gilt; I went far|ther
into other places where there
were a great many of the&s;e Statues,
both of Gold and Silver: &s;everal had
rich Dimond Rings and Rubies on their
fingers; I never &s;aw &s;o many Images
and &s;o much Gold.</P>
<P>I afterwards went to &s;ee the Ele|phants,

&s;ize. I &s;aw a piece of Cannon, ca&s;t
at <HI>Siam,</HI> of eighteen foot long, and
that would carry bullets of three hun|dred
pound weight; there is a great
many Cannons which they make them|&s;elves
in this Kingdom.</P>
<P>The thirty fir&s;t was a day of rejoy|cing
for the King of <HI>Portugal</HI>'s coming
to the Crown, which was &s;olemni&s;ed
by the letting off the great Guns and
&s;everal &s;hews of Fire-works from on
board the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The next morning being the fir&s;t of
<HI>November,</HI> Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> invited me to a
great Fea&s;t, which was made as a farther
continuation of the former Solemnity,
to which I went, and all the Europeans
in the Town, the Guns cea&s;ed not
from firing all that day: after Dinner
there was a Comedy, the <HI>Chianoi&s;es</HI>
began the Po&s;tures, there were <HI>Siamoi|&s;es</HI>
in it, but I knew not what they
&s;aid, their ge&s;tures &s;eemed to me ridi|culous,
and far unlike tho&s;e among&s;t us;
yet there were two men, who a&s;cended
to the top of two Perches which were
hung very high, which had at their
end a little Apple, and &s;tanding up|right
<PB N="50" REF="27">
on the top of them, they &s;hewed
&s;everal &s;trange tricks. Afterwards we
had a kind of Puppet play, which
yielded &s;mall diver&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the fourth being Sunday Mr. <HI>Con|&s;tans</HI>
told me that the King was to go
to the <HI>Pagod,</HI> where he is wont to go
every year, and prayed me to &s;ee him
pa&s;s by. I went with him and all my
Attendance; and having remained
there a while, there appeared a great
gilded Barge, in which was a <HI>Manda|rin</HI>
who came to &s;ee whether all things
were in order: &s;carcely was he pa&s;t by,
but I &s;aw &s;everal Barges wherein were
the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the fir&s;t rank, who
were all of them in Suits of red cloath;
they are wont on the&s;e &s;olemn days to
be all cloathed with the &s;ame colour,
and 'tis the King who nominates it;
they had white Bonnets on, very high
crown'd, and the <HI>Oyas</HI> had at the bot|tom
of their Caps a golden Fringe,
as to their Breeches, 'twas a kind of
Scarf, as I already &s;aid. After them
came tho&s;e of the &s;econd rank, the Life
Guards, &s;everal Souldiers, and then the
King in a Barge attended with two
<PB N="51" REF="27">
others which were very fine ones; the
Watermen were apparelled like the
Souldiers, but onely they had a kind
of brea&s;t and back-plates, and each
of them an helmet on their heads,
which is &s;aid to be of Gold; their <HI>Pagais</HI>
or Sculs were gilt with Gold, as all
the Barges were, which &s;hewed very
fine; there were an hundred and four|&s;core
and five Rowers in each of the&s;e
Barges, and in tho&s;e of the <HI>Mandarins</HI>
about an hundred, and an hundred and
twenty; there were Guards that follow|ed,
and &s;everal other <HI>Mandarins</HI> who
made the rear Guard; the King was
richly Apparelled with &s;everal pretious
Stones, I &s;aluted him in pa&s;&s;ing by, and
he returned my complement, his Train
con&s;i&s;ted of an hundred and forty &s;tate|ly
Barges, which appeared very finely
indeed on the water, marching all in
good order. After Dinner I went
into my Barge to &s;ee the re&s;t of the
Ceremony, at night the King changed
his Barge, and propo&s;ed a prize to
that Barge that &s;hould fir&s;t arrive by
force of Oars to the Palace, he him|&s;elf
was one of the party, and he ad|vanced
<PB N="52" REF="28">
by much before the others, &s;o
that his Rowers won the money; I know
not how great 'twas, the other Barges
pa&s;t on very &s;wiftly, all the River was
covered with them who came to &s;ee
the King; that day being de&s;igned for
his &s;hewing him&s;elf to his People, I
believe there were an hundred thou|&s;and
to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>At night there were Fire-works for
joy of the Coronation of the King of
<HI>England,</HI> the whole affair was well
carried on, and &s;trange Ve&s;&s;els fired
from all parts their Cannon.</P>
<P>On the fifth this Fea&s;t continued,
and the Cannon was fired from all
parts of the Town, Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> in|vited
me to Dinner, where all the Eu|ropeans
were, where I was made very
welcome.</P>
<P>On the eighth the King parted for
<HI>Louvo,</HI> which is a Countrey Seat where
he generally remains for eight or nine
months in the year, it being di&s;tant
twenty Leagues from <HI>Siam.</HI></P>
<P>On the fifteenth I parted for that
place, I lay in the way at a Hou&s;e
which was built for me, 'twas in the
<PB N="53" REF="28">
&s;ame form as that where I had been
Lodged all along, 'twas near where the
King lyes when he goes to <HI>Louvo.</HI> I
remained there all the &s;ixteenth, and
on the &s;eventeenth &s;et out thither,
where I arrived the &s;ame day on eight
at night, I found this Hou&s;e of the
King's built after the Moori&s;h fa&s;hion,
and a man may ju&s;tly prai&s;e the Coun|trey;
in your entrance to it you mu&s;t
pa&s;s through a Garden, where there
are &s;everal Conduits, in this Garden
you a&s;cend five or &s;ix &s;teps, and you
go to a kind of Summer-hou&s;e &s;tand|ing
very high where you take the Air,
I found a very fine Chapel, and a
Lodging for all tho&s;e who attended
me.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> the ninteenth the King
gave me a particular Audience, after
Dinner I went abroad to take the Air
on Elephants, who&s;e goings are very
unea&s;ie and incommodious, I had ra|ther
ride ten Leagues on Hor&s;e back
than one on the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>On the twenty third Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI>
told me the King would give me the
diverti&s;ement of a combat of Elephants,
<PB N="54" REF="29">
and entreated me to bring along with
me the Captains who had conducted
me to &s;hew them the &s;port, who were
the Sieurs de <HI>Vaudricourt</HI> and <HI>Joy|eu&s;e;</HI>
we went thither on Elephants,
and the Fight was carried on after
the &s;ame manner as that which I above
related.</P>
<P>The King &s;ent for the Captains and
told them, he was very glad they were
the King of <HI>France</HI>'s fir&s;t Captains
who came into his Kingdom, and he
wi&s;ht them as happy a return as their
arrival was. He gave each of them
a Scimitar, who&s;e handle and guard
was of Gold, and the &s;heaths almo&s;t
covered with the &s;ame metal, a golden
Chain curiou&s;ly wrought and very large,
a Ve&s;t of cloth of Gold with Gold
buttons; as Mr. de <HI>Vaudricourt</HI> was
the chief Captain, &s;o his Pre&s;ent was
richer and better, the King gave him
notice to have a care of their Enemies
by the way, they an&s;wered that his
Maje&s;ty furni&s;ht them with arms to de|fend
them&s;elves, and that they would
acquit them&s;elves of their duty. The&s;e
Captains &s;pake to him without light|ing
<PB N="55" REF="29">
off their Elephants; I &s;aw very
well that under pretence of a combat
of Elephants, he was minded to make
the&s;e Pre&s;ents in the &s;ight of &s;everal
Europeans who were pre&s;ent, to give
a publick mark of the particular di|&s;tinction
he would make of the <HI>French</HI>
Nation: The King afterwards returned,
and I went to &s;ee an Elephant which
had been brought by the females who
are in&s;tructed to go into the woods
with a man or two to conduct them,
as far as twenty five or thirty Leagues
to &s;eek wild Elephants, and when
they have found any, they &s;o order it
as to draw them on to a place near
the Town de&s;igned to receive them;
'tis a great &s;pace dug in the earth,
and &s;urrounded by a wall of Brick very
high, there is al&s;o a &s;econd inclo&s;ure
about fifteen foot high, through which
a man may ea&s;ily pa&s;s, and a double
gate of the &s;ame height, which &s;huts
of it &s;elf by means of a pully, &s;o that
when an Elephant is within, he can|not
get out. The female Elephants
do fir&s;t enter, the wild ones follow
them, and they are fa&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="30">
This &s;ame day Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> pre&s;en|ted
the two Captains with &s;everal fine
wrought Japon works of Silver and
other Curio&s;ities.</P>
<P>On Saturday the twenty fourth I
got on hor&s;eback to go &s;ee the wild
Elephants taken.</P>
<P>The King being come to the end
of this place which is enclo&s;ed as a|bove
&s;aid, there entred a man who
went with a &s;taff to attack the wild
Elephant, who at the &s;ame time left
the females, and pur&s;ued him, the man
continued this management, and thus
bu&s;ied this wild Elephant, till the
females who were with him got out
of the place by the gate, which was
immediately &s;hut after them, and the
Elephant &s;eeing him&s;elf left alone im|pri&s;oned,
grew inraged; the fellow &s;et
upon him again, and in&s;tead of flying
on that &s;ide which he was wont, he
ran out of the gate, and the Ele|phant
followed him, and when he was
between the two gates he was &s;hut in,
and being hot they threw a great deal
of water on him to refre&s;h him, and
there were &s;everal Elephants brought
<PB N="57" REF="30">
to him, who care&s;&s;ed him with their
trunks, to comfort him as it were;
they tyed his two hind legs, and the
gate was opened to him, he marched
five or &s;ix paces, and found four Ele|phants
of War, and one to confront him,
two others who were fa&s;tned to his &s;ides,
and one behind him to pu&s;h him with
his head; they brought them in this
manner into a kind of Stable ground,
where there was a great &s;take fa&s;tned,
to which he was tyed, and two Ele|phants
were placed on each &s;ide of him
to bear him company, and the others
are led away. When the wild Ele|phants
have remained fifteen days,
in this manner, they know them who
were wont to feed them, and follow
them, and afterwards they become as
tractable as the others. The King
has a great many of the&s;e females
who do nothing el&s;e but decoy the&s;e
wild ones.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> the twenty fifth I went
to &s;ee a Tyger fight with three Ele|phants,
but the Tyger was not the
&s;tronge&s;t, he received a blow with a
tooth that carried a way half his jaw,
<PB N="58" REF="31">
although the Tyger was not wanting
in courage.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the twenty &s;ixth I had a
particular Audience, this being the
fourth time, and the King &s;hewed me
the e&s;teem he had for the French Na|tion,
after &s;everal other di&s;cour&s;es,
of which I have given the King an
account. At night I went to &s;ee a
Fea&s;t, which the <HI>Siamoi&s;es</HI> celebrate at
the beginning of their year, which is
attended with great lights. It's perfor|med
in the Palace, in a great Court,
round about which there are &s;everal
boxes full of Lamps, and before the&s;e
boxes there are a great many perches
drove into the ground, along which
hang &s;everal horn Lanthorns prettily
painted, this Fea&s;t la&s;ts eight days.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI>
Mr <HI>Con&s;tans</HI> &s;ent me a Pre&s;ent, he did
the &s;ame al&s;o to the Abbat of <HI>Choi&s;y,</HI>
and the Gentlemen which accompa|nied
me; the Pre&s;ents were Bracelets,
<HI>China</HI> Cabinets, night Gowns and Ja|pon
works made of Silver Bezoar&s;tones,
Rhinocero's horns, and other curio&s;ities
of that Countrey.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="31">
On the tenth I went to &s;ee the great
hunting of Elephants, which is in this
following form: The King &s;ent a
great number of female Elephants all
in a company together, and when they
have been &s;everal days in the wood,
and he is informed they have found
Elephants, he &s;ends thirty or forty
thou&s;and men, who make a great
ring in the place where the Elephants
are; they po&s;t them&s;elves &s;everal foot
di&s;tance one from another, and each
company has a fire about three foot
high or thereabouts: there is al&s;o ano|ther
ring of Elephants of War, di&s;tant
from one another about an hundred and
an hundred and fifty paces, and in tho&s;e
places where the Elephants may more
ea&s;ily pa&s;s thorough, the Elephants of
War are more numerous; in &s;everal
places there is Cannon which is fired
at the wild Elephants when they will
force a pa&s;&s;age, for they are in great
fear of fire: every day this inclo&s;ure
or ring is le&s;&s;oned and at length 'tis
very &s;mall, and the &s;tres are al&s;o di|mini&s;hed.
The&s;e Elephants hearing a
noi&s;e about them, dare not fly, although
<PB N="60" REF="32">
now and then one or two do e&s;cape,
for I was told that &s;ome days pa&s;t
there were ten got away. When they
are to be taken they are made to en|ter
into a place &s;urrounded with &s;takes,
where there are &s;ome trees, through
which a man may ea&s;ily pa&s;s, there is
al&s;o another ring of Elephants of War
and Souldiers, among which there are
men mounted on Elephants, who dex|terou&s;ly
throw cords at the Elephants
hind feet, who when they are fa&s;tned
are brought between two tame Ele|phants,
be&s;ides which there is another
who tends on him behind, if need be
to pu&s;h him forward, &s;o he is obliged
to march, and when he is unruly, the
others &s;trike him with their trunks;
they bring him into a kind of &s;table
open on all &s;ides, where they are
fa&s;tned and managed as I have already
related: I &s;aw ten taken, and I was
told there were a hundred and forty
in the ring; the King was there pre|&s;ent
and gave orders for what was ne|ce&s;&s;ary.
In this place I had the honour
to have a long conference with him,
and he prayed me to leave Mr. <HI>Fourbin,</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="32">
the Leiutenant of my Ship with him,
which I agreed to, and pre&s;ented him,
and at the &s;ame time the King gave him
a Semitar, who&s;e Handle and Guard was
of Gold, and the Sheath &s;tudded with the
&s;ame, with a Ju&s;taucorp of embroide|red
Satin with Gold Buttons. Then the
King pre&s;ented me with a Golden Cup,
and gave me a Collation in a Grove,
where I had excellent Wine and Fruit.</P>
<P>The next morning being the eleventh
I returned to this game, being moun|ted
on an Elephant, the King was there,
and &s;ent two <HI>Mandarins</HI> to me, to de|&s;ire
me to come to him, he &s;pake &s;eve|ral
things to me, and entreated me to
leave Mr. <HI>de la Mare</HI> the Engineer, who
came along with me behind me, to for|tifie
&s;ome places in his Countrey. I told
him I did not doubt but the King my
Ma&s;ter would be content I &s;hould leave
him, &s;eeing His Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;ts were
as dear to him as his own; I thereup|on
ordered Mon&s;r. <HI>de la Mare,</HI> to re|main
with the King, who gave to him
a Ve&s;t of Stuff of Gold. The King told
me, he would &s;end a little Elephant to
the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> which he &s;hewed
<PB N="62" REF="33">
me, and having a while thought on
it, he &s;aid that if he &s;hould give one
onely to the Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI> he fea|red
le&s;t the Duke of <HI>Anjou</HI> &s;hould take
it ill, and therefore he would &s;end two,
and I de&s;igning to part the next mor|ning
to go on board, I pre&s;ented the
Gentlemen to him who were with me,
to take leave of his Maje&s;ty, the King
wi&s;ht them a good Voyage. The Bi|&s;hop
would have pre&s;ented to him <HI>Me&s;|&s;ieurs,</HI>
the Abbat <HI>de Lionne,</HI> and <HI>le Va|cher,</HI>
Mi&s;&s;ionaries, to take their leave
of him, but he told the Bi&s;hop, that
as to tho&s;e two per&s;ons, they were of
his Family, and that he re&s;pected them
as his Children, and that they &s;hould
take their leave of him in his Ca&s;tle:
afterwards the King retired, and I at|tended
on him to the end of the Wood,
taking the way of <HI>Louvo,</HI> becau&s;e the
King had a Hou&s;e in the Wood, where
he u&s;ually tarries whil&s;t he is bu&s;ied in
this Game of Elephants.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the twelfth, the King
gave me Audience of Leave, the Bi&s;hop
was there, he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay he
was very well &s;atisfied with me and my
<PB N="63" REF="33">
Negotiation; he gave me a great gol|den
Ve&s;&s;el which they call a Bo&s;s, and
this is one of the mo&s;t honourable
marks of the King's Favour; he told
me he would not have the accu&s;tomed
Ceremonies about it, becau&s;e there
might be &s;omething which would not
plea&s;e me by rea&s;on of the Genufle|xions
which the greate&s;t of the King|dom
are obliged to make on this oc|ca&s;ion.
There is no Stranger in his
Court, excepting the King of <HI>Camboye</HI>'s
Nephew, who has received the like
Mark of Honour, which &s;ignifies that
one is an <HI>Oyas,</HI> a Dignity in that Coun|trey
comparable to a Duke in <HI>France;</HI>
there are &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Oyas,</HI> which
are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Bo&s;&s;es. This
Monarch had the goodne&s;s to tell me
&s;everal things in &s;uch an obliging man|ner,
that I dare not relate them; and in
all my Voyage I received &s;uch great Ho|nours,
that I &s;hould &s;carce be believed,
were they not &s;ole due to the Character
His Maje&s;ty has been plea&s;ed to honour
me with: I received al&s;o a thou&s;and
Civilities from his Mini&s;ters, and the
re&s;t of his Court. <HI>Me&s;&s;ieurs</HI> the Abbat
<PB N="64" REF="34">
of <HI>Lionne,</HI> and <HI>le Vacher,</HI> took at the
&s;ame time their leaves of the King,
who having wi&s;ht them a good Voyage,
gave each of them a golden Crucifix,
the Foot of it being Silver. At the
end of the Audience, Mon&s;r. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI>
carried me into a Parlor, &s;urrounded
with Water-&s;pouts which was in the
Palace, where I found a Table very
well &s;pread, after the manner of the
Kingdom of <HI>Siam:</HI> The King had the
goodne&s;s to &s;end me two or three
Di&s;hes from His Table, for he dined
at the &s;ame time; about five of the
Clock I went into a gilt Chair, car|ried
by ten Men, and the Gentlemen
who accompanied me rode on Hor&s;e|back,
we entred into our Barks, and
were attended by a great many <HI>Manda|rins,</HI>
the Streets were lined with Sol|diers,
Elephants, and Moori&s;h Cava|liers.
'Twas the &s;ame al&s;o in the mor|ning,
when I had my la&s;t Audience; all
the <HI>Mandarins</HI> that accompanied me to
my Barge, went into theirs, and came
with me; there were about an hundred
Barges, and I arrived the next mor|ning,
being the thirteenth, at <HI>Siam,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="34">
about three in the morning. The King
of <HI>Siam</HI>'s Letter, and his Amba&s;&s;adors
for <HI>France,</HI> were with me, in a very
&s;tately Barge attended by &s;everal others.
The King made me &s;everal Pre&s;ents,
among&s;t which was a crucifix, the bo|dy
of which is Gold, a Cro&s;s of <HI>Tam|bacq,</HI>
which is a metal more e&s;teemed
than Gold in that Countrey, with &s;eve|ral
other Curio&s;ities of the <HI>Indies;</HI> and
the Cu&s;tome of the&s;e Countries being
to gratifie tho&s;e who bring the Pre|&s;ents,
I gave to the Steers-men of the
King's Barges about eight or nine hun|dred
Pi&s;tols. As to Mon&s;r. <HI>Con&s;tans,</HI> I
took the Liberty to give him a piece of
Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, which I had brought
along with me from <HI>France,</HI> and to
Madam his Wife, &s;everal Pre&s;ents, to
the value of an hundred and fifty Pi&s;tols;
the King al&s;o gave Pre&s;ents to the va|lue
of &s;even or eight hundred Pi&s;tols to
the Abbat <HI>de Choi&s;y</HI> in <HI>China</HI> Cabinets,
<HI>Japon</HI> Works, and other Indian Curi|o&s;ities.</P>
<P>On the fourteenth, at five of the
Clock at night, I parted from <HI>Siam,</HI>
accompanied by Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans;</HI> &s;everal
<PB N="66" REF="35">
<HI>Mandarins,</HI> and a great many Barges,
and arrived at <HI>Bancoc</HI> the next morning,
the Forts by the way, and tho&s;e of <HI>Ban|coc,</HI>
&s;aluted me with all their Artille|ry;
I remained a day at <HI>Bancoc,</HI> be|cau&s;e
the King had told me in an Au|dience,
that being a Soldier, he de&s;ired
me I would view the Fortifications of
it; and to tell his Servants what it
wanted, and to pitch on a place where|on
to build a Church; I drew a &s;mall
draught, and gave it to Mon&s;r. <HI>Con|&s;tans.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth in the morning I
parted thence accompanied by <HI>Manda|rins,</HI>
the Forts &s;aluted me, and at four
of the Clock I arrived at the Bar of
<HI>Siam,</HI> in the Shalops belonging to the
King's Ships, on board of which I went
about &s;even of the Clock.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventeenth the King of <HI>Si|am</HI>'s
Frigat, in which were the Amba&s;|&s;adors,
came and ca&s;t Anchor near my
Ship; I &s;ent my Shalop, which brought
two of the Amba&s;&s;adors, and I after|wards
&s;ent back the &s;ame Shalop, which
brought the other Amba&s;&s;ador, and
the King's Letter, which was written
<PB N="67" REF="35">
on a Leaf of Gold, rowled up, and put
into a Gold Box; we &s;aluted the Letter
with the firing of &s;everal pieces of Can|non,
'twas laid on a Table, with a Ca|nopy
over it, and when the <HI>Mandarins</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t near it, they reverenced it after
their manner, it being their cu&s;tome to
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oe the greate&s;t Honours they are able
to the King's Letter. The next mor|ning
this Ship left us, and went back
again up the River, and at the &s;ame

<P>The Kings of <HI>Siam</HI> were not wont to
let them&s;elves be &s;een as this does; they

<P>Heretofore when the Kings would

can and does do all things under the
King's authority in the Kingdom, but
this Mini&s;ter would never accept of
any great office which the King has
offered him &s;everal times. The <HI>Bar|calon</HI>
who died about two years &s;ince,
and who by right of his place had the
management of all affairs of State, was
a per&s;on of great abilities, that ac|quitted

to death, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him of his
office; he that enjoys it at pre&s;ent
lives in good intelligence with Mr.
<HI>Con&s;tans.</HI></P>
<P>As by the Laws introduced by the
Prie&s;ts, who are called <HI>Talopoins,</HI> 'tis not
allowable to kill, &s;o Malefactors were
heretofore condemned to the chain, or
led into &s;ome De&s;erts to peri&s;h there
with hunger, whereas this pre&s;ent King
cau&s;es their heads to be &s;truck off,
and throws them to Elephants.</P>
<P>The King has &s;pies to know whether
matters of any importance are con|cealed
from him, he mo&s;t &s;everely
cha&s;ti&s;es tho&s;e, who abu&s;e their autho|rity.
Every &s;trange Nation e&s;tabli&s;hed
in the Kingdom of <HI>Siam</HI> has particular
Officers, and the King takes of all the&s;e
Nations per&s;ons which he makes gene|ral
Officers throughout all his King|dom.
There are many <HI>Chinoi&s;es</HI> in
his Countrey; there were heretofore
many Moors, but &s;ome years pa&s;t he
<PB N="81" REF="42">
di&s;covered &s;o many foul treacheries
among&s;t them, &s;uch frauds and enor|mities,
that he has bani&s;h'd mo&s;t of
them out of his Countrey.</P>
<P>The commerce of &s;trange Merchants
was heretofore very con&s;iderable; but
&s;ince &s;ome years, the various revolu|tions,
which have happened in <HI>China,
Japon</HI> and other parts of the Indies,
have di&s;couraged all Trade. Yet 'tis
hoped, &s;eeing all the&s;e di&s;turbances
are quieted, Trade will flouri&s;h again;
and that the King of <HI>Siam</HI> by means
of his Mini&s;ter will &s;end his Ships to
take in the mo&s;t pretious commodities
in all the Ea&s;tern Countries, and re|duce
all things to their fir&s;t &s;tate.</P>
<P>They make War after a different man|ner
from mo&s;t Nations, driving their
Enemies out of their places, without
doing them any farther harm than the
making them &s;laves; and if they bear
Arms, it &s;eems rather they intend to
affright them by &s;hooting on the ground
or up into the air, than to kill them,
and if they doe, 'tis rather out of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
than by their good-wills; but this
happens &s;eldom, becau&s;e all their Ene|mies
<PB N="82" REF="43">
follow the &s;ame method. There
are Companies and Regiments who are
detached from the re&s;t during the night,
who go into the Enemies Villages, and
lead away all the Inhabitants captives,
as well Women as Children; the King
gives them Lands and Buffalo's to cul|tivate
them, and when the King has
need he makes u&s;e of them. The&s;e
late years, the King has made War a|gain&s;t
the revolted <HI>Cambogions,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted
by the <HI>Chinoi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Cochinnoi&s;es,</HI> where
he was forced to fight in earne&s;t, and
there were &s;everal Souldiers killed on
both &s;ides: He has had &s;everal Com|manders
that are Europeans, who in|&s;truct
them to fight after our man|ner.</P>
<P>Before this War there was a great
commerce between their States, and
that of <HI>Siam</HI> drew great advantages by
the great quantities of Gold, Musk,
Elephants teeth and other Merchandi&s;es
which came from <HI>Laos</HI> in exchange for
Linen and other Goods.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Siam</HI> is &s;till at wars

Crowns: The King of <HI>Siam</HI> wrote to the
King of <HI>Colconde</HI> to &s;end him back tho&s;e
Fugitives, or oblige them to pay the
Sum, but the King would not li&s;ten to
the propo&s;al, which has put the King
of <HI>Siam</HI> on proclaiming a War again&s;t
him, and taking a Ship at the time
when I was at <HI>Siam</HI> belonging to him,
who&s;e lading is valued at an hundred

<P>Of late the Emperour of <HI>China</HI> has

retreat to Elephants, Tygers, and wild
Cows, Deer, and Rhinocero's, and o|ther
Animals, which are here in great
quantities.</P>
<P>As to Plants and Fruits, there are &s;e|veral
in the Countrey, but which are
not of great u&s;e, and which cannot be
ea&s;ily brought over, by rea&s;on of the
length of the way. There are no Birds
but what we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> excepting
one like a Black-bird, which counter|feits
the laughing of a Man, his &s;inging
and whi&s;tling; the Fruits the mo&s;t e&s;tee|med
are Durions, they have a very
&s;trong &s;cent, which does not agree with
every body, but as to their ta&s;te 'tis
excellent. This fruit is very hot and
dangerous to ones health, if a Man eats
much of it. There is a great Nut,
about which is a kind of Cream &s;hut in
a rine, which my Palate could never
approve of.</P>
<P>Mango is in this Countrey in prodi|gious
quantities, and this is the be&s;t
Fruit in the <HI>Indies,</HI> of an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te,
no ways incommoding, unle&s;s a Man
eats too much of them, then indeed
<PB N="105" REF="54">
they may cau&s;e a Fever; it's like an Al|mond,
but as big as a large Pear.</P>
<P>The Mangou&s;tan is a Fruit like a
green Nut, which has within it a white
Fruit, of a &s;harp and plea&s;ant ta&s;te,
like that of a Peach or Plum, it's very
cold, and yet &s;tringent.</P>
<P>The Jacques is a great Fruit which
is very good, but hot, and cau&s;es Fluxes
in the Bowels when one eats of it with
exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The Nana is like the Durion, that is
to &s;ay, in re&s;pect of its Skin, it has at
its end a crown of leaves, like the Ar|tichoke;
its meat is very good, ta&s;ting
like a Peach and Apricock together;
it's very hot and &s;trong, which makes
it commonly eaten &s;oakt in Wine.</P>
<P>The Figs are a &s;weet Fruit of a kind
nature, yet &s;omewhat phlegmatick,
there are of them all the year long.</P>
<P>The Ate is a very good &s;weet Fruit,
and does no hurt; there are who e&s;teem
it more than all the Fruits in the <HI>Indies.</HI>
There are Oranges of all kinds, which
are very good.</P>
<P>The Pataie is a very good Fruit, but
the Tree which bears it lives onely two
years.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="55">
The Penplemou&s;e is a whole&s;ome
Fruit which is like the Orange, but
of a &s;harper ta&s;te. There are &s;everal
other Fruits which are not &s;o good.
They began &s;ome years pa&s;t to &s;ow
Corn in the high Countries, near the
Mountains, which comes up well, and
is very good.</P>
<P>As al&s;o Vines which have been &s;everal
times planted, but to little purpo&s;e,
being eaten up to the roots, by a &s;ort
of Ants.</P>
<P>There are a great many Sugar Canes
which yield abundance, as al&s;o To|bacco,
which the <HI>Siamoi&s;es</HI> eat with
<HI>Arrek</HI> and <HI>Lime.</HI></P>
<P>As to the <HI>Arrek</HI> the <HI>Siamoi&s;es</HI> e&s;teem
this Fruit more than any other, for
this is their common food; there is
&s;uch a great quantity of it, that the
Markets are full of it; and a <HI>Siamoi&s;e</HI>
would think him&s;elf guilty of a great
undecency, &s;hould he &s;peak to any one
without having his mouth full of <HI>Arrek
Betel,</HI> or Tobacco.</P>
<P>There is no City in the Ea&s;t, where
is &s;een more different Nations, than
in the Capital Town of <HI>Siam,</HI> and
<PB N="107" REF="55">
where &s;o many different Tongues are
&s;poken; it is two Leagues round, and
half a League long, well peopled, al|though
&s;o much under water, that it
re&s;embles rather an I&s;land; there are
none but Engli&s;h, French, Moors and
<HI>Chinoi&s;es</HI> who dwell in the Town, all the
other Nations being lodged round about
it in Camps, each Nation by them|&s;elves,
who, &s;hould they come all of
them into one body, would take
up as much room as the Town does;
but the rea&s;ons I before mentioned
hinder mo&s;t &s;trange Nations to come
and bring any thing with them.</P>
<P>The people are obliged to &s;erve
the King four months in the year, and
longer if he needs them; he gives
them no pay, they being obliged to
keep them&s;elves; and therefore the
Women work to maintain their Hu&s;|bands.</P>
<P>As to the Officers, from the greate&s;t
Lords of the Court, to the meane&s;t of
the Kingdom, the King onely allows
them &s;ome &s;mall gratifications, being
as much &s;laves as the re&s;t, and this
&s;aves a great deal of money. As to
<PB N="108" REF="56">
far di&s;tant Provinces who&s;e Inhabitants
do not actually &s;erve, each &s;ingular
per&s;on pays him a Tribute. I arrived
at a time when the Countrey was wholly
under water, the Town &s;eemed the
more plea&s;ant for it; the Streets are
very long, large and &s;treight, there
are on both hands Hou&s;es built on
Piles, and Trees planted round about
them, which makes a fine &s;ight, and
you cannot go to them but in a Boat;
you would think you &s;ee at one look
a City, a Sea and a va&s;t Fore&s;t, where
are &s;everal <HI>Pagodes,</HI> which are their
Churches, mo&s;t of which are gilded;
about the&s;e <HI>Pagodes</HI> there are places
like Church-Yards, planted with Trees,
which are for the mo&s;t part Fruit-Trees,
the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Talapoins</HI>
are the bigge&s;t and fine&s;t, and are very
numerous.</P>
<P>This Countrey is whol&s;omer than
any of the Indies; the <HI>Siamoi&s;es</HI> are
commonly well &s;hap'd, although all of
them have tanned Countenances, they
are well &s;ized, their Hair black, which
they wear &s;hort by rea&s;on of the heat,
they Bathe often, which contributes to
<PB N="109" REF="56">
the pre&s;ervation of their health; the
Europeans who dwell there do the
&s;ame to avoid &s;ickne&s;s: They go a|bout
all their bu&s;ine&s;s in Barges, du|ring
the Inundations, which la&s;ts &s;ix
or &s;even months together.</P>
<P>The King ri&s;es in the morning, and
holds a great Council about ten of the
Clock, wherein all affairs are treated
of, which being ended his Phy&s;icians
a&s;&s;emble to know the &s;tate of his health,
and he afterwards goes to Dinner; he
makes but one real Meal a day, and after
Dinner he withdraws into his Apart|ment,
where he &s;leeps two or three
hours, and 'tis not known about what
he imploys him&s;elf the re&s;t of the time,
it not being permitted his Officers to
enter into his Chamber. About ten
at night he holds another privy Coun|cil,
where there are &s;even or eight
<HI>Mandarins</HI> of tho&s;e which are mo&s;t in
his favour; which Council la&s;ts till
mid night: Afterwards he has Hi&s;tories
or Ver&s;es made after their manner
read to him, to divert him, and com|monly
after this Council, Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI>
tarries with him alone, to whom he
<PB N="110" REF="57">
opens his whole mind; the King being
&s;en&s;ible of his va&s;t parts, his Conver|&s;ation
plea&s;es him, and he &s;eldom can
get away till three of the clock in the
morning; and this is the manner of
the King's living. At certain times he
takes plea&s;ure in hunting, as I already
ob&s;erved; he is always well dre&s;t: He
has no other Children, but a Daughter,
who is called the Prince&s;s Queen, of
twenty &s;even or twenty eight years of
age, the King greatly loves her; I was
told &s;he was a hand&s;ome woman, but
&s;he has never been &s;een by any men,
&s;he eats in the &s;ame place and at the
&s;ame time her Father does, but at a
Table apart, and &s;he is &s;erved by
Women, who are always pro&s;trate in
her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>This Prince&s;s has her Court con|&s;i&s;ting
of <HI>Mandarins</HI> Ladies, who &s;ee
her every day; and &s;he holds a Council
with her Women about her own affairs;
&s;he di&s;tributes Ju&s;tice to tho&s;e belong|ing
to her, and the King having given
her Provinces, &s;he maintains her Court
with the Revenue. It has happened
that when her Women have been pro|ved
<PB N="111" REF="57">
guilty of great &s;landers, or revea|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing
Secrets of great importance, &s;he
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> made their mouths be &s;owed up.</P>
<P>Before the death of the Queen her
Mother, &s;he was as 'tis &s;aid inclinable
to gr&egrave;at &s;everities; &s;he goes &s;ometimes
a Hunting with the King, but 'tis in
a curious Chair placed on an Elephant,
and where though &s;he is not &s;een, yet
&s;he beholds all that pa&s;&s;es. There are
Hor&s;emen who march before her to
clear the way, and if there be any
one in the road that cannot &s;oon get
out, he pro&s;trates him&s;elf on the ground
on his face. She is all day &s;hut up with
her Women, diverting her &s;elf with no
work, her dre&s;s is plain and light,
her Legs bare, &s;he has light Pumps on
her feet, always bare headed, and wears
her Hair not pa&s;&s;ing four or five Fingers
long: She is a great lover of &s;weet
&s;cents, anointing her Head with oil;
for in tho&s;e Countries their Hair mu&s;t
look &s;hining, to be fine; &s;he Bathes
every day, which is the cu&s;tome of all
Indians, as well men as women: I
have learnt all this of Madam <HI>Con&s;tans,</HI>
who oft makes her Court to her. All
<PB N="112" REF="58">

are always pro&s;trate with their faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
the ground in a rank; the anciente&s;t are
neare&s;t her, and they have the liberty
to look on the Prince&s;s, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
have not in reference to the King, be
they of what quality they will; for as
long as they are in his pre&s;ence, they
lye pro&s;trate on the ground, even when
they &s;peak to him.</P>
<P>The King has two Brothers. The
King's Brethren here are next Heirs of
the Crown, to the Exclu&s;ion of his
Children. When he goes out to Hunt
or walk, notice is given to all Euro|peans
not to be in the way, unle&s;s they
will lye pro&s;trate on the ground. A
while before he goes out of his Palace
you hear the Trumpets &s;ound and
Drums beat, who march before the
King; at this noi&s;e the Souldiers who
&s;tand in a row, pro&s;trate them&s;elves,
their foreheads to the ground, with
their Muskets under them; they are
in this po&s;ture as long as the King
can &s;ee them on his Elephant, where
he is placed in a clo&s;e gilt Chair; the
Hor&s;e-Guard which attends him, which
<PB N="113" REF="58">
con&s;i&s;ts of Moors is about forty, all
the King's Hou&s;hold are on foot, &s;ome
behind and &s;ome on one &s;ide, holding
their hands clo&s;ed, and thus follow
him.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome of the principal
<HI>Mandarins</HI> who follow him on Ele|phants,
ten or twelve Officers who car|ry
Umbrellas about the King, and
there are onely tho&s;e who do not pro|&s;trate
them&s;elves, for at the &s;ame mo|ment
that the King &s;tops, all the other
fall down on their faces, and even tho&s;e
that are on Elephants.</P>
<P>As to the manner which the King
of <HI>Siam</HI> ob&s;erves in the reception of
Amba&s;&s;adors, as tho&s;e of <HI>Tonquin, Co|chinchine,
Colconda, Malais, Java,</HI> and
other Kingdoms; he receives them in
a great Hall covered with Tape&s;try,
the chief men of the Kingdom being
in another Hall which &s;tands lower,
and the Officers of le&s;&s;er quality in
another, lower than the former, all of
them pro&s;trate on Tape&s;try in expecta|tion
of the King's appearance at a
window which is over again&s;t them;
the Hall wherein the Amba&s;&s;adors
<PB N="114" REF="59">
mu&s;t be is rai&s;ed about ten or twelve
feet, and di&s;tant from this Hall thirty
feet; 'tis known the King is upon ap|pearing
by the noi&s;e of Trumpets,
Drums and other In&s;truments: The
Amba&s;&s;adors are behind a wall which
enclo&s;es this Room in expectation of
the King's coming, and the Mini&s;ter's
orders, which the King &s;ends by
one of the Officers of his Chamber,
according to the quality of the Am|ba&s;&s;adors;
after the Mini&s;ters have the
King's command, the door of the Hall
is opened, and then the Amba&s;&s;adors
appear with their Interpreters, and
the Officer of the King's Chamber,
who &s;erves for a Ma&s;ter of Ceremonies,
and precedes them on his Knees, his
hands clo&s;ed; the Amba&s;&s;ador with his
Interpreters follows him in the &s;ame
po&s;ture, with great mode&s;ty, till he is
come one half of the way where he is
to go, and then bows him&s;elf three
times, and &s;o continues going to the
neare&s;t corner of the Halls where the
Guards are, and then he begins to
bow again; there is a Table between
the King and the Amba&s;&s;ador, about
<PB N="115" REF="59">
eight foot di&s;tant, where lye the Pre|&s;ents,
which the Amba&s;&s;ador brings
the King, and between this Table and
the Amba&s;&s;ador's there is a <HI>Mandarin</HI>
who receives the King's words: in this
Hall are the King's Mini&s;ters, di&s;tant
from the Amba&s;&s;adors about three
paces, and the Captain of the people,
whence the Amba&s;&s;ador is, between him
and the Mini&s;ters; the King begins to
&s;peake fir&s;t, and not the Amba&s;&s;ador,
ordering his Mini&s;ters to enquire of
the Amba&s;&s;ador, when he parted from
the Pre&s;ence of his Ma&s;ter, whether
the King and all the Royal Family be
in health, to which the Amba&s;&s;ador
an&s;wers what's fitting, by his Interpre|ter,
the Interpreter tells it the Cap|tain
of the Nation (as they call it)
of which the Amba&s;&s;ador is, the Cap|tain
to the <HI>Barcalon,</HI> and the <HI>Barcalon</HI>
to the King. After this the King
offers &s;ome que&s;tions about two or
three Points concerning the Amba&s;&s;a|dor;
and afterwards the King orders
the next Officer to the Table to give
<HI>Betel</HI> to the Amba&s;&s;ador, which is the
&s;ign to pre&s;ent him a Ve&s;t; and im|mediately
<PB N="116" REF="60">
the King retires with the
noi&s;e of Drums and Trumpets, and
other In&s;truments. The Amba&s;&s;ador's
fir&s;t Audience pa&s;&s;es between him and
the Mini&s;ter, who examines the Letter,
and the Pre&s;ents of the Prince who
has &s;ent them: The Amba&s;&s;ador does
not pre&s;ent the Letter to the King,
but to the Mini&s;ter, after &s;ome days
of Council held on this &s;ubject.</P>

in this following manner.</P>
<P>The Grandees of the fir&s;t and &s;econd
rank go to the foot of the window
where the King is, to pro&s;trate them|&s;elves
according to their qualities on
Tape&s;try, when tho&s;e of the third,
fourth and fifth rank, are in a lower
Hall, and expect the King's coming,
who appears at a window which jets
out of a wall, and is rai&s;ed ten foot;
the Amba&s;&s;adors are in a place out
of the Palace, expecting the Ma&s;ter
of the Ceremonies, who comes and
receives them, and there are the &s;ame
<PB N="117" REF="60">
Ceremonies u&s;ed which I have already
mentioned. The Amba&s;&s;ador entring
into the Palace, puts his hand upon
his head, marches through two Halls
to the Stairs, which are over again&s;t
the window where the King is, and
when he is there, he claps one knee
to the ground, and then immediately
a door is opened that he may appear
before the King, and the &s;ame Cere|monies
are practi&s;ed which I have al|ready
denoted. There is a Golden
Platter on the Table, wherein lyes the
letter tran&s;lated and open, having
been received by the Mini&s;ters &s;ome
days before in a Hall appointed for
that purpo&s;e. When the Amba&s;&s;ador
is in his place the Mini&s;ter's Deputy
takes the Letter, and reads it aloud;
which done, the King asks the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
&s;ome que&s;tions by his Mini&s;ter,
his Mini&s;ter by the Captain of the
Nation, and the Captain by the In|terpreter,
as I have already ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Having learnt this manner of recei|ving
Amba&s;&s;adors, which did not &s;eem

<P>We hoi&s;ted Sail at three of the mor|ning

ran on ground, on the &s;ide of an I&s;le
called <HI>Lucapara,</HI> on a Muddy bank
where there were but three fathoms of

water, and our Ve&s;&s;el required above
&s;ixteen; this did not much di&s;turb me,
though it did much the Ships Crew,
whom I &s;ent to &s;ound about the Ve&s;|&s;el,
I cau&s;ed a &s;mall Anchor to be
brought, to which there was a Cable,
and we got off this bank in le&s;s than
five hours, and though I had a good
Dutch Pilot, yet I cau&s;ed this Strait
to be often &s;ouded; I continued my
cour&s;e and arrived at <HI>Bantam</HI> the
eleventh of <HI>January,</HI> 1686. As &s;oon
as I had ca&s;t Anchor there, I &s;ent an

Governour, and to have fre&s;h provi|&s;ions.
He &s;ent me for a Pre&s;ent &s;ix
Oxen, Fruits and Herbs, and I re|mained
in this Road but thirty hours.
We weighed Anchor on the twelfth

which obliged us to ca&s;t Anchor.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth I weighed Anchor,
and we had all that day calms and con|tray
winds, but at night there aro&s;e
a &s;mall wind, which made us double
the point of <HI>Bartam,</HI> and pa&s;s the
Strait of <HI>Sonda</HI> in le&s;s than eight hours:
I was obliged to land at the I&s;le of

<P>On the fourteenth I held on my cour&s;e

with a favorable North wind, and North
North-Ea&s;t. The twenty third at break

<P>This I&s;land lyes very low, and had
it been three or four hours in the night,
we had certainly run on ground, but
it plea&s;ed God to pre&s;erve us. We
attributed this error to the Tides which
ran again&s;t us; we pa&s;t this I&s;le quick|ly,
the wind blowing hard, and con|tinued
our cour&s;e. The Sea is full
of Fi&s;h in the&s;e parts, and there are a

fifty Leagues; we were diverted by

&s;ees him&s;elf pur&s;ued, gets out of the
water, and flyes as long as his wings
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ie moi&s;t, which may be as far per|haps
as the flight of wild Ducks;
but there is a Bird which carries a great

the form and almo&s;t the colour of a

when he &s;ees this flying-fi&s;h leave

at fir&s;t I thought it was that which
had left me, but coming nearer, we
&s;aw her carrying Engli&s;h Colours, and
being willing to hear. News, and &s;up|po&s;ing
&s;he came from <HI>Europe;</HI> I came
up to her, and &s;ent out my long Boat
with an Officer, to know if there were
any Wars, for when a man has been
long at Sea, one Knows not whom to
tru&s;t; word was brought me 'twas an
Engli&s;h Merchant-Man, who, had par|ted
from <HI>London</HI> five months &s;ince,
and had touched now here, and that
he intended &s;treight for <HI>Tonquoin,</HI> that
the Captain had told him that there
<PB N="123" REF="63">
was no War in <HI>France,</HI> and that all
<HI>Europe</HI> was at Peace; but yet there
had been &s;ome troubles in <HI>England</HI>
occa&s;ioned by the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI>
who had placed him&s;elf at the Head of
ten or twelve thou&s;and men, but that the
King's Troops had routed them, and
taken him Pri&s;oner; and that he was
beheaded, and &s;everal of his Followers
hanged, and &s;o this rebellion was ended.
He al&s;o told us that he had &s;een Land
the day before &s;even Leagues off, which
made us judge that we were thirty or
thirty five Leagues off of it. We held
on our cour&s;e the re&s;t of the day and
night, and the next morning at ten
of the clock we &s;pied Land, &s;even or
eight Leagues off us; I &s;ounded and we
found four&s;core fathom and upward,
we clapt on all our Sail to endeavour
to get before night to the Cape of
Good Hope; the next morning at
break of day we &s;aw it and doubled
it; about ten of the clock we e&s;pied
a Ve&s;&s;el windward of us, and drawing
near we found 'twas the Frigat, which
left us near the I&s;le of <HI>Maurice;</HI> this
was the &s;econd time we met after our
<PB N="124" REF="64">
&s;eparation, both together at the place
of our appointment, which &s;eldom
happens on the Sea. When I was
ready to ca&s;t Anchor the wind blew
&s;o hard again&s;t us, that I was forced
to tack about and Anchor at the I&s;le
of <HI>Robins,</HI> which is about three Lea|gues
from the Fort of the Cape; the
next morning being the thirteenth of
<HI>March</HI> we weighed Anchor, and went
and rode near the Fort, where I arrived
about two of the clock: I found there
nine Ve&s;&s;els which came from <HI>Batavia,</HI>
and were bound for <HI>Europe.</HI> I &s;ent the
Ghevalier <HI>Cibois</HI> to Complement the
Governour, and to ask his leave to
&s;end eight or ten &s;ick people on &s;hoar,
and take in fre&s;h water and nece&s;&s;ary
Browi&s;ions. He received re&s;pectfully
my Complement, and bid the Officer
tell me, I was Ma&s;ter, and that I might
do what I plea&s;ed. Arriving there in
Autumn, wherein all Fruits are good,
he &s;ent me Melons, Grapes and Salads,
I &s;aluted the Fort with &s;even Cannon;
for the King's order is to &s;alute the
Forts fir&s;t, and they were exactly an|&s;wered.
The Ve&s;&s;el which carried the
<PB N="125" REF="64">
Admiral's Flag, &s;aluted me afterwards
with &s;even pleces, and I returned him
the &s;ame Civility. There were in this
fleet three flag Ships, to wit, the Ad|miral,
Vice-Admiral and Counter-Ad|miral.
The Fruit which was &s;ent me
were excellent good, as well as the Sa|lads,
and &s;o were the Melons and
Grapes; I went to land, and walked
in their Garden, which made me re|member
tho&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> for as I alrea|dy
&s;aid, 'twas a very fine one, and
well kept; the great quantity of Pul&s;e
growing there is very gratefull to Sea|faring
Men, the Governour was no Nig|gard,
ordering us what we plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>He is a Man of &s;en&s;e, and well be|comes
the place he holds, in which 'tis
&s;aid, if he remains long, he will make
his Fortune: When there be any <HI>Hol|landers</HI>
that will dwell there, he gives
them as much Land as they will, builds
them a Hou&s;e, gives them Oxen for
Tillage, and all other Cattel and Uten|&s;ils
of Husbandry that are nece&s;&s;ary;
all which is valued, and when they
are able they pay the Company for
them. They are obliged to fell all the
<PB N="126" REF="65">
Fruits of their Lands to the Comapany,
at a certain price, which is advanta|gious
to both parties. The Wine that
they buy of them for &s;ixteen Crowns an
Hog&s;head, they &s;ell for an hundred to
&s;trangers, and to their own Fleets which
pa&s;s this way; that is to &s;ay, to the
Seamen who drink it on the &s;pot; Sheep
and Oxen are &s;old al&s;o proportionably,
which brings a great Revenue to the
Company; and makes their Fleets re|fre&s;h
them&s;elves at &s;mall charge, and
remain whole months there, according
to their occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>When I arrived, 'twas not long &s;ince
the Governour was returned from a
Di&s;covery which he had made of Gold
and Silver Mines. 'Tis &s;aid that there
are many, and that they lie ea&s;ie and
&s;hallow. He was two hundred and fifty
Leagues up the Countrey; he carried
along with him three or four <HI>Outan|to&s;ts,</HI>
who &s;pake Dutch, who lead him to
the next Nation, which was likewi&s;e <HI>Ou|tanto&s;ts,</HI>
and took others in his way. He
met with near nine different Nations,
or &s;orts of People, &s;ome of which he
took along with him, according as he
<PB N="127" REF="65">
changed the People, to make him&s;elf
under&s;tood; he has, I am told, gotten
great light in what he aimed at; he
&s;ays the la&s;t Nation is the mo&s;t po|li&s;hed,
and that they came before him
Men and Women dancing, being all
clothed with the skins of Tygers, which
hung down to their Feet. He brought
one of the&s;e <HI>Outanto&s;ts,</HI> whom he has
cau&s;ed to be taught Dutch, to return
thither the next Year. All the&s;e &s;eve|ral
People have many Cattle, and this
is their Revenue. The Governour had
with him fifty Souldiers, a Painter to
draw colours of Bea&s;ts, Birds, Ser|pents;
and &s;uch Plants as he &s;hould find;
one to ob&s;erve the cour&s;e they took,
and a Pylot, for they went always by
the Compa&s;s, and drove along with
them three hundred Oxen, to carry
their Provi&s;ions, and draw fourteen or
fifteen Carts; when they met with any
Mountains they di&s;mounted their Car|riages,
and took out what&s;oever was
therein, and loaded the Oxen with it,
and thus pa&s;&s;ed over them. Being ad|vanced
in the Countrey, they were
three or four days before they could
<PB N="128" REF="66">
find any Water, which much incom|moded
them; he was five Months and
an half in this Journey.</P>
<P>He met with &s;everal wild Bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and
&s;ays that the Elephants are Mon&s;ters,
far exceeding in bigne&s;s tho&s;e of the
<HI>Indies;</HI> as al&s;o Rhinocero's of a prodi|gious
&s;ize. He &s;aw one with which he
thought he &s;hould have been killed;
for when this Animal is in a fury, there
is no weapon can &s;top him, his Skin is
hard, and a Mu&s;quet &s;hot cannot pierce
it; they have two Horns which grow
together in the Skin of this Animal.</P>
<P>The Abode I made at the Cape fur|ni&s;hed
me with Fi&s;h during the time of
Lent. I &s;aw a Whale of the large&s;t &s;ize,
I think which came within le&s;s than a
Pi&s;tol &s;hot of our Ve&s;&s;el; there were al|&s;o
&s;tore of Birds, which gave us the
&s;ame diver&s;ion as tho&s;e which I have
already mentioned.</P>

</LIST>
<P>On the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>March</HI> at two
in the afternoon, I &s;et Sail with a
good Wind; in leaving the Bay near
the Dutch Fort of the Cape of Good
Hope, I &s;aw three Ve&s;&s;els who made
towards the Cape, but I could not di|&s;tingui&s;h
of what Nation they were, I
<PB N="134" REF="69">
believe them to have been Dutch, be|cau&s;e
this number was expected from
the I&s;le of <HI>Ceilan.</HI> After we had pa&s;t
forty Leagues from thence, we found
the Sea very boi&s;terous, which gave us
much trouble, but we continued on
our cour&s;e to pa&s;s the Line in the &s;ame
longitude we did before. Our Voyage
mu&s;t needs be plea&s;ant, for as I alrea|dy
noted, the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;ent with
us Amba&s;&s;adors into <HI>France,</HI> to &s;hew
the King how earne&s;tly he de&s;ired his
Friend&s;hip; his great Qualities and Re|nown
having reached his Ears, and
been long &s;ince known in the <HI>Indies.</HI>
He told me in an Audience, that he
would give them no In&s;tructions in
point of Ceremony, tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI>
being very different from his King|dom's,
becau&s;e he was per&s;uaded the
King would not require any thing of
them prejudicial to his Honour, and
that he would leave me to coun&s;el them
what they had to doe when they came
to <HI>France;</HI> that he relied upon me for
this, being &s;ure I would not impo&s;e
upon them. We had then with us three
Amba&s;&s;adors, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable
<PB N="135" REF="69">
Per&s;ons in <HI>Siam.</HI> The fir&s;t is Brother
to the late decea&s;ed <HI>Barcalon,</HI> who was
the King's Chief Mini&s;ter, a Man of
&s;en&s;e, having been ever concerned with
his Brother in all his greate&s;t Affairs;
this Per&s;on, accompanied with another,
came and received me at the mouth of
the River of <HI>Siam,</HI> when I arrived, and
has been ever with me, attending me
wherever I went. The fir&s;t time I &s;aw
him he &s;eemed to me an ingenious Per|&s;on,
free from all affectation and re|&s;ervedne&s;s,
which made me tell Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>Con&s;tans</HI> that he would be a very
fit Man to be &s;ent over Amba&s;&s;ador to
<HI>France.</HI> The &s;econd is aged, and wants
not wit, having been Amba&s;&s;ador in
<HI>China,</HI> and acquitted him&s;elf to the
King his Ma&s;ter's Satisfaction. The
third is aged about twenty five or thir|ty
years, his Father is Amba&s;&s;ador in
<HI>Portugal;</HI> the&s;e are the be&s;t natured
People in the World very ea&s;ie and
obliging, good humoured, and their
Friend&s;hip is not to be regarded as un|profitable.
They write down the &s;mal|le&s;t
matters they &s;ee, and I like that
the better, &s;eeing they will have Ob|&s;ervations
<PB N="136" REF="70">
enough in <HI>France,</HI> neither do
I doubt but they will give a true Ac|count
of them to their Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>They &s;hould have had twelve <HI>Man|darins</HI>
for their Retinue, but they have
but eight, four of them being left be|hind
at <HI>Siam,</HI> becau&s;e they came not
&s;oon enough on board; they brought
with them twelve young Youths, to
learn the Tongue, and Trades, but part
of them are al&s;o left behind with the
<HI>Mandarins.</HI> The Abbat <HI>de Lionne</HI> was
entreated by this King to go to <HI>France</HI>
with his Amba&s;&s;adors, becau&s;e he &s;peaks
their Language. The King al&s;o told
Mr. <HI>Vacher,</HI> that he would be very glad
that he would return with his Amba&s;|&s;adors,
which he has al&s;o done; he
will be to them of great u&s;e, being an
active Per&s;on. We have al&s;o with us
Mon&s;r. the Abbat <HI>de Choi&s;y,</HI> who went
to <HI>Siam</HI> to re&s;ide there in quality of
Amba&s;&s;ador, in ca&s;e the King &s;hould
become a Chri&s;tian; he is a very ho|ne&s;t.
Gentleman, and wants no good
quality. He &s;aid his fir&s;t Ma&s;s on board
us, and gave us &s;everal good Sermons;
Mon&s;r. the Abbat <HI>du Charter</HI> was of our
<PB N="137" REF="70">
company, an able and hone&s;t Preacher.
Mr. <HI>Vaudricourt</HI> was the Captain of our
Ve&s;&s;el; he is a Gentleman admira|bly
well qualified for his Place, taking
care of every thing that concerned
him, and gave us all content.</P>
<P>There have remained about twelve or
fifteen French men at <HI>Saim,</HI> in the Ser|vice
of that King, or Mr. <HI>Con&s;tans</HI></P>
<P>I Continued my cour&s;e till I dame
near to the I&s;le of St. <HI>Pleten</HI> which is
inhabited by Engli&s;h; &s;uch Ships as
come from the <HI>Indies</HI> touch there, that
is to &s;ay when they go not to the
Cape of Good Hope; I was told it
was a very good and fruitfull I&s;land,
it lyes &s;ix Degrees Latitude Southwards
I pa&s;t on in &s;ight of the I&s;le of <HI>A&s;|cen&s;ion</HI>
which is eight degrees South|ward
of the Line. This I&s;le is not in|habited,
mo&s;t Ve&s;&s;els make &s;ome &s;tay
here to take Tortoi&s;es, there being
here great numbers of them, and they
are no &s;mall refre&s;hment to Sea-faring
men; they live a month or &s;ix weeks
without eating, they can onely be ta|ken
a nights, for in the day time they
keep to the Sea, and at night come
<PB N="138" REF="71">
to Land to lay their Eggs, which they
hide in the &s;and. To take them you
mu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ly hid with a great &s;tick in your
hand, and &s;urpri&s;e them when they come
out of the water, and throw them on
their backs, and then they cannot &s;tir;
a man may &s;trike four&s;core or an
hundred in a night. Here Ve&s;&s;els come
on purpo&s;e to take the&s;e animals and
&s;alt them, and then carry them to the
I&s;les in <HI>America,</HI> being bought by
the Inhabitants for their Slaves. Ha|ving
a good wind I tarried not long
here, not being willing to lo&s;e time
in pa&s;&s;ing the Equinoctial Line; for
&s;ometimes a man is forced to be long
about it by rea&s;on of calms and rains
to be met there: The twenty eighth of
<HI>April</HI> I pa&s;t the Line mo&s;t happily, the
heats no wi&s;e incommoding us; this is
the fourth time I pa&s;t it without lea|ving
my Cloth Suit; all our men were
in health excepting four or five, who
were &s;ick of the Gripes, which Di&s;|temper
they brought from <HI>Siam;</HI> this
Di&s;temper is &s;eldom cured in that
Countrey, and I lo&s;t about ten or
twelve men who died of it. We &s;aw
<PB N="139" REF="71">
but few Fi&s;h all along, which is unu&s;ual,
for one commonly meets with great
quantities: We took one about eight
foot long and four foot broad, he had
a hole on the to pof his head, through
which he breaths, and throws up wa|ter
into the air like a fountain; he
made a great noi&s;e, and weighed about
three hundred weight, he is good to eat.
On the twenty ninth we took two
more Fi&s;h which weighed about an
hundred and fifty a piece. We were
on the Northern Coa&s;ts, having a good
wind; I was about thirty two days
coming from the Cape of Good Hope
to the Line.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth of <HI>May</HI> about
midnight we pa&s;t the Tropick accor|ding

could make in taking the height. On
