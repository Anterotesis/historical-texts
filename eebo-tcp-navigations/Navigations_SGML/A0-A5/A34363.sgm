<L>'Twas from this Land he got his Love mi&s;hap,</L>
<L>But after &s;leeping in fair <HI>Dido</HI>'s Lap,</L>
<L>Who coud have Dreamt of &s;uch an After-Clap?</L>
</LG>
<L>From hence to <HI>Rome</HI> the Mi&s;creant Exile flys,</L>
<L>Depending mo&s;t upon his Enemies;</L>
<L>His promis'd Empire he demands of Fate,</L>
<L>Neither regarding Subjects Love nor Hate:</L>
<L>Can Providence and &s;uch Inju&s;tice be?</L>
<L>No, Heav'n it &s;elf repents its own Decree:</L>
<L><HI>Jove</HI> therefore by the <HI>Stygian</HI> Torrent &s;wore,</L>
<L>No Traytor ere &s;houd find &s;uch Fortune more.</L>
