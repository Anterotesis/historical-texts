<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not, I pre&s;ume, be thought a|mi&s;s to acquaint the Reader, that the&s;e Papers had in all probability lain long buried in Du&s;t and Ob&s;curity, had not &s;ome fal&s;e Copies, which by chance came lately to the true Author's notice, &s;tole Clande&s;tinely into the World under the &s;pecious Title of Mr. <HI>Roger's Three Years Travels over</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Wales, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are indeed &s;o unadvi&s;edly patch'd toge|ther, &s;o wretchedly Curtail'd, &s;o horribly Im|perfect, and abominably Erroneous, that the right Author was obliged in his own Vin|dication to publi&s;h from his own true Ma|nu&s;cript, which hath been formerly, and of late, peru&s;ed by the Hands of &s;ome Learn|ed Men, a more Authentick Copy. And though he cannot as yet di&s;cover this my|&s;terious
<PB REF="5">
Cheat, which has for &s;ome time walked in Darkne&s;s, yet to di&s;courage for the future all &s;uch unbecoming mercenary Attempts, he re&s;olved at la&s;t with him&s;elf, by a more correct Edition, to expo&s;e the Plagiari&s;m and Di&s;hone&s;ty of &s;uch vile Pul|troons, and &s;candalous Undertakers, which have appeared with &s;uch open and brazen|faced Effrontery.</P>
<P>And though indeed they have put on what fal&s;e Di&s;gui&s;e they can to Cheat the World, and &s;et off the Book with the mo&s;t plau&s;ible Varni&s;hes, that thereby they might the better recommend it to the Reader, yet there doth appear throughout the whole Series of it &s;uch horrible Blunders, and im|pardonable Mi&s;takes, &s;uch &s;illy Shiftings and Turnings both of Things and Places, &s;uch crude Apologies for its Brevity, and in &s;hort, &s;uch a &s;hameful Contexture of Ig|norance and Impudence clo&s;ely link'd toge|ther by that unlearned Fry. To give but one notorious In&s;tance here for all, their placing, <HI>Page 99.</HI> the Seven Wonders of the <HI>Peak</HI> in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Darby|&s;hire;</HI> though there are divers other as gro&s;s Errours, if it be worth while to rake into them, as their fal&s;e Tran&s;cribing or leaving out quite divers proper Names of great Significancy; as al&s;o what chiefly re|lated to the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, that as &s;uch un|comely

<P>Now &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable Adverti&s;ement as this is, being &s;ufficient to caution the un|wary Reader again&s;t all other previous Edi|tions, will become as ju&s;t an Apology for the pre&s;ent Publication of the&s;e en&s;uing Papers, which if &s;o u&s;eful and diverting (as the World is told) under a fal&s;e Vizor, will now prove, it is to be hoped, more plea&s;ing and acceptable in their own true, native Co|lours.</P>
<P>For they will here meet with a more full and accurate De&s;cription, though not of every individual Town and Place of Note within the Dominions of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> yet with a true and impartial Account of mo&s;t Cities and Towns Corporate, with their famous Cathedrals and other eminent Stru|ctures; of the mo&s;t remarkable Havens and Rivers, of divers curious Caves, Wells and Mines, with many other divertive Pa&s;|&s;ages, and hi&s;torical Relations, with &s;eve|ral ancient In&s;criptions, Epitaphs and Ob|&s;ervations, which were yet never taken no|tice of by any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Topographer, which be|ing &s;ome Years ago Penned for the u&s;e of Two Young Gentlemen, Sons to Mr. <HI>Van-Acker,</HI>

formerly an eminent Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> whom the Author had the happine&s;s to ac|company in the&s;e Travels, is now again Re|vi&s;ed to make it the more con&s;ummate and inviting.</P>
<P>So that who&s;oever is di&s;po&s;ed to Travel Abroad, or to &s;ee, which indeed is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t, and acquaint him&s;elf with the Rarities of Nature at Home, may know hereby in what Parts of our I&s;land to find them; and for tho&s;e who having already vi|&s;ited remoter Regions, are &s;o &s;trangely en|ravi&s;hed with the pro&s;pect of Foreign Va|rieties, that they are hardly brought to be|lieve any thing in their own Native Soil equal to &s;uch Di&s;coveries as they have made in other Countries; this may be &s;ufficient to inform them, That there is not any thing worth our Wonder Abroad, whereof Nature hath not written a Copy in our own I&s;land: And it cannot be too frequently ob&s;erved, that as <HI>Italy</HI> has <HI>Virgil</HI>'s Grotto, and the <HI>Sybil</HI>'s Cave by <HI>Puteoli,</HI> &s;o <HI>England</HI> hath <HI>Ochy-Hole</HI> by <HI>Wells,</HI> and <HI>Pool</HI>'s by <HI>Bux+ton</HI>: We have <HI>Baiae</HI> at the <HI>Bath,</HI> the <HI>Alps</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> the <HI>Spaw</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire, A&s;|phaltites</HI> at <HI>Pitchford</HI> in <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> the <HI>Pyramids</HI> at <HI>Stonehenge,</HI> Pearls of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and Diamonds of <HI>India</HI> at St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock.

<P>So that &s;ince <HI>England</HI> is not de&s;titute of tho&s;e many taking Things, which all Travel|lers &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately admire Abroad, it is very incongruous to pretend to be acquaint|ed with other Countries, and to be Strangers to their own, which is an Epitome of all other; and which upon all the&s;e, as well as other Accounts, may very ju&s;tly claim and challenge, as a due Debt, all tho&s;e glorious Elogies which both Ancient and Modern Writers have conferred upon it.</P>
<P>And having thus briefly declar'd the main De&s;ign and Scope of this Narrative, I &s;hall neither Complement my Reader into its ac|ceptance, nor trouble my &s;elf to make any Harangue in Apologizing for its Contri|vance; for as for all Candid Per&s;ons, I que|&s;tion not but their Cen&s;ures will be as favour|able as their Humours ingenuous: And as

for &s;uch &s;narling Criticks, and carping <HI>Mo|mus</HI>'s of the Age, who can &s;ooner find a Fault than mend it, I am &s;ure mo&s;t comple|mental Apologies will never work in them Candour or good Nature; I &s;hall therefore endeavour to Arm my &s;elf again&s;t all their Cavils, with the excellent Advice of the wi&s;e Morali&s;t <HI>Mimnermus,</HI>

<HEAD>A Narrative of his fir&s;t Journey.</HEAD>
<P>WHen the Spring had rendred the Roads pa&s;&s;able, and the Country was a fit|ting Entertainment for Travellers, the Gentlemen, who&s;e Names I have given my &s;elf the Honour of In&s;erting in the Title, were plea&s;ed to take me for their Compa|nion, in order to have a View of tho&s;e Places, which were under the &s;ame Government with the City from whence they &s;et out, and which it was
<PB REF="8">
not Improper to be acquainted with before they made a Vi&s;it to Nations more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ote. And &s;ince it is but natural for the Inhabitants of other Coun|tries to be as inqui&s;itive after our Scituation and E&s;tabli&s;hment, as we are after Theirs; we could not but endeavour to provide our &s;elves with an <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> by the Knowledge of our own Country's Con&s;titution, before we had occa&s;ion to ask <HI>Que|&s;tons</HI> in Relation to tho&s;e of others.</P>
<P>As the&s;e were the Rea&s;ons which occa&s;ion'd our Journey, &s;o we took a time in which it was agree|able to make one. The Sea&s;on of the year pu&s;h'd us forward, and the delights which it afforded were motives enough to per&s;uade us to take leave of the Glorious City of <HI>London,</HI> which is <HI>Caput Gentis,</HI> and an Epitome of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Middle|&s;ex.</NOTE>We took our Journey through <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> a Country famous for its goodly Edifices, as well wi&s;ely compacted together upon the plea&s;ant Banks of <HI>Thames</HI>; as likewi&s;e for divers &s;tately and magni|ficent Palaces di&s;per&s;ed in &s;everal other parts there|of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uxbridge</NOTE> to <HI>&V;xbridge,</HI> anciently <HI>Woxbridge,</HI> &s;eated on the <HI>Colne,</HI> which parts it from <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> a Town Built of late times, well &s;tored with Inns, and of a con&s;iderable length. This was the place famous in the Year 1644. for a Treaty held be|twixt King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, and the Parliament, where after &s;everal Debates by Commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides, the Treaty of Peace was unhappily broken off, and ended in a Deluge of Blood, which &s;peedily over-ran this whole Nation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bucks.</NOTE>From <HI>&V;xbridge,</HI> we came into the County of <HI>Bucks,</HI> which might po&s;&s;ibly receive its Denomi|nation from its Fertility in Beech-Trees, there being a Province in <HI>Germany</HI> called <HI>Buchonia</HI> for that very rea&s;on: 'Tis a Country rich in Pa&s;ture, and &s;o convenient for Grazing, that the Inhabi|tants thereof do very much addict them&s;elves to that Employment, receiving great Advantages by
<PB N="3" REF="8">
the Vicinity of <HI>London,</HI> where the Markets are very Encouraging, the Prices being high, and the Returns con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Beconsfield,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Becons|field <HI>and</HI> Wickam.</NOTE> a Town better known, in that it was formerly part of the Inheri|tance belonging to the Noble Family of the <HI>Schu|damore</HI>'s, than for any thing at pre&s;ent of greater Con&s;equence, we arrived at <HI>Wickam</HI> or <HI>Wicomb,</HI> &s;ituated above a plea&s;ant Valley, by which runs along a little Rivolet, and perhaps from this &s;itu|ation it took its Name; for <HI>Combe,</HI> &s;aith the Great Antiquary Mr. <HI>Somner,</HI> in his Saxon Dictionary, is a Valley enclo&s;ed on either &s;ide with Hills; and <HI>Wick,</HI> &s;aith the &s;ame Author, is the turning, win|ding, or hollowne&s;s of Water-banks, or the cur|ving reach of a River: 'Tis a Town for large|ne&s;s and buildings, not much inferiour to any throughout the Shire; and hath a Mayor and Al|dermen to govern and &s;upport it; and is a place very much celebrated for the abundance of Bone-Lace u&s;ually made here, which brings no &s;mall Advantage and Profit to its Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Having refre&s;h'd our &s;elves a while here, we &s;et forward for <HI>Oxford&s;hire,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Oxford|&s;hire.</NOTE> which being once entred into, we could not &s;ufficiently enough admire the plea&s;antne&s;s of the Soil; for there it is that <HI>Ceres</HI> be&s;tows her Gifts mo&s;t liberally upon the laborious Husbandman; there it is the Meadows are garni|&s;hed with <HI>Flora</HI>'s curious Embelli&s;hments; and the great variety of Plants allure and invite the indu|&s;trious Herbali&s;t into a more &s;trict Enquiry of their Names, Natures, and Properties: There it is where the Hills adorned with &s;hady Woods, af|ford mo&s;t delight&s;ome Bowers to wearied Students, whil&s;t the Silver-&s;tream'd Rivers with their gentle Murmurs nimbly cour&s;ing along by the humble Valleys, do whet their Fancies, and &s;crue up their Inventions to the highe&s;t pitch.

What can be more diverting than the River <HI>Cherwell,</HI> which being well reple|ni&s;hed with numerous Shoals of Fi&s;h, after it hath for a time parted this County from <HI>Northampton|&s;hire,</HI> pa&s;&s;eth through the mid&s;t of it, and divides it as it were into two equal Portions?

<P>The Cave, as we went along, was parted into &s;everal kind of Rooms; the names whereof our Guides informed us to be thus: The fir&s;t was the Kitchen, in which by the Door &s;ticks out a large ma&s;s of the Rock, which they tell us was the Por|ter's Head formerly the Keeper of this Cave; it &s;eems to bear that kind of re&s;emblance, and tho' by that is a Stone which they call the Tomb-&s;tone, under which they report that he lies interred, and his Dog hard by him too, metamorphos'd into the &s;ame lapideous Sub&s;tance, yet their Transfor|mations are not &s;o &s;trange and wonderful, though perhaps &s;omething too fabulous to be given credit to, as the variety the Rock affords into which they are incorporated, part of it gli&s;tering like Silver, and part like Diamonds, and both appear|ing very plea&s;ant to the Eye. A little farther on the Right Hand is another piece of the Rock, that bears the re&s;emblance of a Bell; and on the Left, of a Ve&s;&s;el, which they term a <HI>Ceave,</HI> in which the Beer of an old Sorcere&s;s (Cou&s;in to the famous <HI>Circe,</HI> Lady Governe&s;s of this di&s;mal Cave) u&s;ed to be work'd in.

After &s;ome more difficulties in our Pa&s;&s;age, and no le&s;s dangerous than before, we came into another part of the Cave, more &s;trange than any we had yet &s;een: 'Tis a place which they call the Dancing-Room, &s;o well contrived and arched above, that Nature hath here wrought what Art can never be able to attain: If you look up, the variety of Colours which are there to be &s;een by the light of the Can|dles, and the checquered Configurations of the Rock, which is now very high above your Head, will both fea&s;t your Eyes and refre&s;h your Body, which by that time is &s;ufficiently wearied by the tediou&s;ne&s;s as well as the trouble of the Pa&s;&s;age; for there is &s;o great a gli&s;tering, &s;uch a lu&s;tre as it were of Silver and Precious Stones about you, that you would be ready to mi&s;take your &s;elf, and think that you were in the Palace of &s;ome great Monarch of the World, and not in the &s;ubterra|neous Caverns of the Earth. If you look down, there you will find no &s;tony, hard, rugged tract to perplex you, but a fine, even, &s;andy Floor to divert you; and indeed it was beyond expecta|tion, that we who had beheld before nothing but &s;uch craggy Stones and dangerous Pa&s;&s;ages, &s;hould at la&s;t arrive in &s;o &s;pacious and delightful a Place: They told us it was not unu&s;ual for the Gentlemen and Ladies in tho&s;e Parts to bring Mu&s;ick and Dance here, the Mu&s;ick, by rea&s;on of the Eccho, making a Melody more &s;weet than ordinary.

But we were not as yet &s;atisfied, though we were near half a Mileunder Ground in a di&s;mal Grotto, but went on farther to a place termed the Cellar, that is curiou&s;ly Vaulted; and 'tis very u&s;ual to carry Bottles of Wine, and drink there upon a Stone Table, which is formed out of the Rock. In this place lies a huge Ma&s;&s;y Stone, which they call the Great Gun; the nature of which is this, take it but up in your Hands, and let it fall down to the Ground, and a great Gun cannot give a louder report: We tried this experiment thrice, but we thought the Rock we were under would have rent in Pieces about our Ears, yet they who were half way in the Cave, or at the Mouth of it, or above it, heard no noi&s;e at all; this we found experimentally true, for one of the Gentlemen who entred in with us, being beat out with the difficulty of the Tracts, &s;taid about the middle-way, and when we returned back to him, he a&s;&s;ured us, that where he &s;tood he had heard nothing of a noi&s;e. But at length, at the end of the Cellar, after we had gone down lower &s;ome few Steps, a Rivolet there was that gave a period to our Progre&s;s; it was pretty deep, and as clear as Cry&s;tal, the Water extream cold, but very plea&s;ant to the Palate, and runs along the Cave &s;ometimes in a &s;mall, and &s;ometimes in a larger Current, where taking up &s;ome of the congealed Matter that lies at the bot|tom of it, we found it very hard, of a dusky co|lour, and of a round con&s;i&s;tency, ju&s;t as if a little company of Hail&s;tones were cemented and joined together, and the River running along under Ground, tho' its Head from whence it fir&s;t &s;prings, like that of the <HI>Nile</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> is not as yet plain|ly di&s;covered, and conveying it &s;elf at la&s;t out of

But though the place was &s;ome|thing re&s;embling an infernal Aby&s;s, and our Pa&s;|&s;age into it proved &s;o trouble&s;om and irk&s;om, yet we came back without any toil, or rather with great facility and plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding it is impo&s;&s;ible to find out the way without a Guide, there being &s;o many windings and turnings; nor could the Guides them&s;elves ever extricate them|&s;elves out of this dark&s;om Labyrinth, but by the light of Candles, whereby they are enabled to &s;teer their Cour&s;e. However at la&s;t we made a &s;hift to creep up again to the top of the Rock, ju&s;t as merry <HI>Lucian</HI> tells us old <HI>Menippus</HI> did out from a hole in <HI>Lebadia,</HI> after he returned from Hell, and had ended his Di&s;cour&s;es with the Gho&s;ts below, and went back to the place where we fir&s;t di&s;mounted, and left our Hor&s;es to graze with the neighbouring Shepherds.</P>

with a Wall, commodious for its Market-place, and hand&s;omly adorned with three Churches, one whereof is very large and &s;patious, built in the form of a Cathedral, the Steeple is four-&s;quare, and hath a Ring of tunable Bells, and the Quire is grac'd with a &s;mall but &s;weet Organ: And in it are erected &s;everal ancient and &s;tately Monu|ments of Per&s;ons of great Quality, and of &s;ome Bi&s;hops of this See, who have been mo&s;t noble Be|nefactors to it. 'Tis govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the A&s;&s;izes are generally kept there in the Summer time: But that which is mo&s;t remarkable, and cau&s;eth a concour&s;e not only of the Nobility and Gentry, but of the Commonalty too from all parts of the Nation hither, are the Baths, which are not inferiour to any whatever in <HI>Europe:</HI> The Waters herein are hot, of a blue|i&s;h Colour, &s;trong &s;cent, and &s;end forth thin Va|pours; and as, without que&s;tion, they have &s;trengthened many weak and feeble Limbs, &s;o do they cure divers Di&s;ea&s;es, which are incident and de&s;tructive to humane Nature, by cau&s;ing Men to Sweat either more or le&s;s proportionably to their Di&s;tempers. There are four or five which are principally in reque&s;t, one Triangular, and called the <HI>Cro&s;s-Bath,</HI> from the Cro&s;s that &s;tood formerly in the mid&s;t of it; 'tis about twenty-five Foot long, and as broad at one end, the heat of it gentler than the re&s;t, becau&s;e it has fewer Springs. Whil&s;t we continued in the Town, we were pre&s;ented by the Serjeant of this Bath with a piece of Earth, which was digged up here at the lo&s;s of a Spring; it &s;melt like Sulphur, and burnt like Soot. We &s;aw likewi&s;e a piece of an Elm-Tree, which was digged up at the &s;ame time, together with the Skull of a Woman taken up then too, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain there many Years before the Bath was &s;o enclo&s;ed. The Orders are &s;trict and regular, and Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality prefer to bathe here, and to drink

the Water hereof with Limona Sugar, rather than of the other. Hard by this &s;tands the Hot <HI>Bath,</HI> not much frequented &s;ave by tho&s;e who have quite lo&s;t the u&s;e of their Limbs, the Water hereof being much hotter than the re&s;t. Not far from this is that which they call the <HI>Leper</HI>'s <HI>Bath,</HI> which is be|liev'd to be very efficacious again&s;t that loath&s;om Di&s;ea&s;e, and an Ho&s;pital or Spittle, built by <HI>Reginald,</HI> Bp. of <HI>Bath,</HI> for the u&s;e of poor, aged, decrepit People. About the middle of the Town, nearer to the great Church, are the King and Queen's <HI>Baths,</HI> divided only by a Wall; the la&s;t having no Spring in it, but receiving the Water from the King's <HI>Bath,</HI> which is about 60 Foot &s;quare, and has in the middle of it many hot Springs that make its heat the greater: Each of the&s;e two <HI>Baths</HI> have a Pump to pump Water upon the Di&s;ea&s;ed; and I have ob&s;erved &s;ome Per&s;ons who have been troubled with great Pains in their Heads, or other parts of their Body, have &s;uffered very great quantities of this &s;calding Water to be poured on them by their Guides. Hereabouts, formerly, was found an ancient Statue of <HI>Hercules</HI> among&s;t other great Mo|numents of Antiquity, holding a Serpent in his Hand, which was di&s;cover'd in the Ruines of an ancient Temple, perhaps that which was here Con&s;ecrated to <HI>Minerva,</HI> and it might be thought very convenient, that he being the Tu|telary Patriot of &s;uch places, and having &s;o fre|quently expo&s;ed him&s;elf to hard Labours, and manifold Dangers, might now and then ea&s;e, and refre&s;h his wearied Limbs by &s;uch Purgations, as the <HI>Bath</HI> could afford him. In this, and other <HI>Baths,</HI> hang divers Crutches of lame and decrepit Per&s;ons, which they left behind them as Trophies of their Recovery, being perfectly cured of their Lamene&s;s and Infirmity, and re&s;tor'd again to their former Health and Strength. There is &s;till one behind, which is call'd the Hor&s;e-<HI>Bath,</HI> which is &s;aid to be as effectual for the cure of lame and

And becau&s;e Di&s;cipline is ne|ce&s;&s;ary in Bodies Spiritual as well as Civil, for tho&s;e who&s;e Natures might be &s;o ba&s;e and di&s;inge|nuous, as that Rewards could not move or incite them to Virtue, &s;he found out the more rough and har&s;h ways to enforce them, by inflicting &s;uch Penalties, as the very Shame thereof might be Spurs and Goads to their future Reformation; The&s;e were all comprized in a Book of Statutes, according to the Rule whereof all Per&s;ons, here to be admitted Members, are &s;worn to &s;quare and regulate their Actions.

Upon this Con&s;ideration to remove all &s;uch Inconveni|encies, and pre&s;erve it in a flouri&s;hing Condition, divers Per&s;ons of Quality of the Black as well as Scarlet Robe, gave large Contributions for the enlarging of it; and by their Liberality there was &s;ome Years ago erected a new and far more noble Fabrick than the other, called the New-Building, four Stories high, built of Free-&s;tone, and adorn|ed with curious Embelli&s;hments in the Front, in the mid&s;t whereof is a &s;mall arch'd Cloy&s;ter, and through that a Pa&s;&s;age into the Orchard; in which are plea&s;ant Walks, &s;hady Arbours, and &s;ecret Re|ce&s;&s;es for the Fellows to retire to in Summer time: So ready and careful were our Noble Ance&s;tors to gratifie the Mu&s;es in every re&s;pect, and to &s;uffer them to lack nothing either for Improvement or De|light. And indeed it hath been the main care and aim of &s;uch Per&s;ons, who have been admitted Ma&s;ters or Fellows, by their great Improvements in all &s;ort of Learning, to an&s;wer tho&s;e ends and de&s;igns for which they were admitted. And, not to mention &s;everal Per&s;ons decea&s;ed, who having received their fir&s;t Rudiments here, became after|ward great Luminaries in the Church, and Co|lumns in the State: His Grace the pre&s;ent Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>York</HI> is a &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of this, who&s;e great Learning and exemplary Piety add now at this time no le&s;s a Lu&s;tre to the Church, than it doth likewi&s;e &s;till to this College, where he was formerly a mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd Member.

The Country, &s;aith he, Ea&s;tward is fruitful and plea&s;ant, abounding with all &s;orts of Grain, but more particularly with Barley, which makes ma|ny of the Inhabitants con&s;iderable Malt&s;ters; but the We&s;tern, into which we are now entring, and is commonly called the <HI>Peak,</HI> is Mountainous, as you &s;ee, and Rocky, though Nature makes a &s;ufficient amends for the Barrenne&s;s of the Soil by her hidden Trea&s;ures, which are here frequently di&s;covered. Its length from North to South is about 30 Miles, and its breadth about 20, and the Moors, upon which we now are, are of an un|known Longitude running along, they &s;ay, to the very Borders of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and having divers Names

an&s;werable to the places through which they are extended, out of which divers Rivolets have like|wi&s;e their Source and Original, who pay all their little Tributes to the more noble River of <HI>Trent,</HI> which receiving all their petty Homages, makes at la&s;t an acknowledgment of its Royalty to the Ocean.

<P>As for we poor Folk that live here about the&s;e <HI>Moors,</HI> and in the&s;e parts, we make a &s;hift to live, but it is hardly, and if any eat their Bread in the &s;weat of their Brows it is we; and we &s;eem to be in a continual quarrel with the Earth, that fir&s;t gave us a Being, for we are continually opening her Veins, and for Anger, eating even into her very Bowels; &s;ome of us are employed in the Quarrys for Mill, and Whet-&s;tones, and in &s;ome places to dig Marble and Alaba&s;ter out of the Earth: Others are &s;et to look for Antimony, or to dig for Leaden Oar, and after with great diffi|culty, &s;ometimes, with the lo&s;s of their Limbs, they have got it up from the Mines, they are for|ced to hazard the re&s;t by their indefatigable La|bour, before they can melt, and &s;hape it into Pigs and Sows.

<P><PB N="89" REF="51">The Character this Man gave us of the&s;e Inha|bitants, was as &s;trange and uncommon, and he had ju&s;t ended his Di&s;cour&s;e, when we Rode by a piece of Ground, which was all inclo&s;ed with Stone: We asked him the meaning of it, &s;tanding &s;o a|lone without any other Inclo&s;ures near it, who replied, that it was cu&s;tomary to inclo&s;e &s;ome of their Grounds after this manner, Wood and Bu|&s;hes here to make Hedges with, being a very &s;carce Commodity, and yet that all Hunters who there pur&s;ued their Game never baulked them in the lea&s;t, but made their way over them with great facility, which the next day we found true, for meeting &s;ome Gentlemen in a warm Cha&s;e after a Hare, we ob&s;erv'd them to Cour&s;e nimbly with their light Gennets in tho&s;e places, where we dur&s;t &s;carce Trot, and at la&s;t poor Pu&s;s to be|come the Prey of the unwearied Pur&s;uers.

<P>And took up our Inn at <HI>Bakewell,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bakewell.</NOTE> which was made a Borough by <HI>Edward</HI> the Senior; it was called by the <HI>Saxons, Badecanwylla,</HI> in who&s;e Neighbourhood, &s;aith the <HI>Saxon</HI> Chronicle, in the year 924, King <HI>Edward</HI> Commanded a City to be built, and a Cittadel for the Defence of it 'Tis a Market-Town much re&s;orted to by the Inhabitants of the <HI>Peak,</HI> (which by the <HI>Saxons</HI> was formerly called <HI>Peaclond</HI>) and found it a place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Won|ders of the <HI>Peak.</HI></NOTE> from whence we might very appo&s;itely ac|compli&s;h tho&s;e de&s;igns we had propo&s;ed to our &s;elves, of viewing the &s;even Wonders, which are here &s;o famous, whereupon fitting our &s;elves again with a Guide, we &s;et out for the pro&s;pect of &s;uch celebrated Varieties.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="52">When we were got about two Miles from that Town, we ob&s;erved upon the top of a Hill, a particular piece of Ground, which was of a &s;trange Nature, as our Guide inform'd us. It was a Field, on which, for the mo&s;t part, there was very good Gra&s;s, which, within the &s;pace of a Month, would either Fat, or kill any Hor&s;e that was put into it. As we Rode on, we found our fir&s;t Pilot's De&s;cription in mo&s;t points truly verifi|ed, for we met divers Hor&s;es loaden with Lead and Coals, and were frequently &s;urrounded as well with plenty of Leaden Mines, as Quarrys of Stone, and Coals, till at la&s;t we arrived at the Ca&s;tle in the <HI>Peak,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;tle in the <HI>Peak.</HI></NOTE> which is eight or nine Miles from <HI>Bakewell</HI>; 'tis of great Antiquity by its Ru|ines, and &s;eems to have been impregnable by its Situation upon a high and dangerous Rock, which is &s;o &s;teep, and craggy, that there appears but one way, by which there is any acce&s;s to it.</P>
<P>At the bottom of the Hill, which is near two Miles in the De&s;cent, by rea&s;on of its &s;teepne&s;s and frequent windings, &s;tands a Village, call'd <HI>Ca&s;tleton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;tleton.</NOTE> &s;ufficiently noted for that wide &s;ubterra|neous Cavern, known commonly by the Name of the <HI>Devil's Ar&s;e</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Devils Ar&s;e.</NOTE> it runs under this Hill upon which the Ca&s;tle &s;tands, and at its Entrance is large and capacious, though the further you go in, the more narrow it is, and contracted: Within the Mouth of it are &s;everal &s;mall Cottagers, who dwell in little clay Tenements erected therein; the top whereof is of a very great height, and appears to the Eye, as if it was Arched above, and Che|quer'd with diver&s;ity of coloured Stones: At our Entrance, the poor People were ready to attend us with Candles and Lanthorns, and by their Con|duct we ventured in, though it belonged to <HI>Satan</HI>'s Territories. After we were got a little way with|in it, we found it very dark and &s;lippery, by rea|&s;on of a great Current of Water, which runs a|long the Cave, and were often forced to &s;toop, be|cau&s;e

The Story of the Shepherd, which pa&s;s'd over all, and at la&s;t came out into a fair delightful Field, &s;avours too much of a Ro|mance, to be credited; however, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, could all the&s;e Waters be once pa&s;s'd over, there might be made &s;ome new Di&s;coveries, though I confe&s;s I &s;hould be extream loath, were it to pur|cha&s;e the Fame of a <HI>Drake,</HI> or a <HI>Frobi&s;her,</HI> to &s;eek out a New found Land in &s;o di&s;mal a place, which both by its Name and Nature, hath &s;o near a Relation to the Diabolical Regions.</P>

'Tis a high and &s;teep Cliff, call'd <HI>Mam-Tor,</HI> from the top whereof, the Sand, though the Air be never &s;o calm and &s;erene, doth continually tricle down Night and Day: The Sight of which put us in mind of that Hill, where poor <HI>Si&s;yphus</HI> was allotted to Puni&s;hment, of row|ling up a Stone which immediately tumbled down again, and &s;o wearied the Wretch out in an endle&s;s Labour; and this bearing &s;ome little re|&s;emblance to that, by the frequent rumbling down of the Stones from above, which falling down from the Precipice with a very great Noi&s;e, do of|ten a&s;toni&s;h and afright the poor Neighbouring In|habitants, made us a little &s;tand off at a di&s;tance, believing our Curio&s;ity would not countervail

the Hazards we might run, or the Damage we might receive by our too near Approaches: On the Top hereof ari&s;eth a Spring, which in &s;ome places &s;treams along the Cliff, but affords nothing of Variety, &s;ave that it hath its &s;ource about that high Mountain.</P>
