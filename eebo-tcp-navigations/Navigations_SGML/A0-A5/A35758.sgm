<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF Candia.</HEAD>
<P>IT were altogether incon&s;i&s;tent with the truth of our intended <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of <HI>Candia,</HI> and would &s;well it to a larger Volume then is de&s;ign'd, to ac|quaint you with the various Poetical Fictions and Fabulous Stories of Doting Antiquity, concerning the &s;ame; as, that it was the Kingdom of <HI>Saturn</HI> in the In|fancy of the World; the Birth-place and Nur|&s;ery of his Son <HI>Jupiter;</HI> the Seat and Re&s;i|dence of <HI>Minas,</HI> and <HI>Rhadamanthus,</HI> who&s;e
<PB N="2" REF="4">Laws were afterwards imitated in the Prime Cities of <HI>Greece;</HI> and the abode of the lu&s;tful <HI>Pa&s;iphae;</HI> as al&s;o, that here was the &s;o much, celebrated <HI>Labyrinth</HI> made by <HI>Daedalus</HI> for the inclo&s;ing and &s;ecuring the <HI>Minotaure:</HI> nor mu&s;t it be forgotten, &s;aith that <HI>Learned Knight,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>W.

Therefore we &s;hall onely glance upon them where the nature of the Subject requires it, and endeavour to give you an exact compendious account of the Names and Scituation of the Place, the fertility and Commodities of the Soil; the nature of the Inhabitants, and their Ancient as well as Mo|dern Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government: and &s;o proceed to the original cau&s;e of the Siege, and the tran&s;actions in 1666, 1667, 1668, and part of 1669 till its &s;urrender.</P>
<P><HI>Candia</HI> hath in &s;everal Ages, and in &s;everal Authors, obtain'd &s;everal names (as Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> hath ob&s;erv'd.) By <HI>Homer</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tathius</HI> it is call'd <HI>Heca|tompolis,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="4">from the number of one hun|dred Cities it then contain'd; but in proces of time, and by the deva&s;tation of War, they are all &s;o de&s;troy'd, that the ruines of them are hardly vi&s;ible. By <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Solinus, Maca|ros,</HI> and <HI>Macarone&s;es,</HI> the happy or fortunate I&s;land, from the goodne&s;s of the Soil and tem|per of the Air. By <HI>Stephanus, Idaea,</HI> from <HI>Ida</HI> a famous Mountain there. By <HI>Giraldus, Tel|chinia,</HI> from the <HI>Telchini</HI> Prie&s;ts of <HI>Cybele</HI> (the Wife of <HI>Saturn,</HI> and Mother of the Gods) who was the principal Godde&s;s of this I&s;land. The general Name which hath prevailed mo&s;t in all Writers, is that of <HI>Crete,</HI> called <HI>Creta, qua&s;i Cureta,</HI> by the Figure <HI>Syncope,</HI> from the <HI>Curetes</HI> the Inhabitants hereof, and Prie&s;ts of <HI>Cybele,</HI> &s;o called, <GAP DESC="foreign">, from their ton|&s;ure or &s;having of the head: and this &s;eems the be&s;t Etymology; though &s;ome derive it from <HI>Cretes</HI> the Son of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and others from <HI>Crete</HI> the Daughter of <HI>He&s;perus.</HI> At pre&s;ent it is known by the name of <HI>Candia,</HI> either <HI>&agrave; Can|dore</HI> from the whitene&s;s of the Rocks which encompa&s;s it, or from <HI>Candia</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Candia</HI> is an I&s;land, and according to <HI>Clu|verius</HI> in his Geography, the large&s;t of all the I&s;les that are adjacent to <HI>Greece;</HI> being, as <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and our late Co&s;mographers write, in
<PB N="4" REF="5">length 270, in breadth 50, and incompa&s;s 590 Miles; and &s;cituated in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> at &s;o equal, a di&s;tance from <HI>Europe, A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> according to Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh,</HI> as if it were naturally de&s;ign'd to be what <HI>Ari|&s;totle</HI> calls it, The Lady and Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Sea; for it is di&s;tant from <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> now called <HI>Morea,</HI> one hundred Miles; as many from <HI>A&s;ia minor,</HI> and not above one hundred and fifty from the &s;hore of <HI>Africa;</HI> verifying that of <HI>Virgil:</HI>
<Q>Creta Jovis magni medio jacet in&s;ula Ponto.</Q>
<Q><L><HI>Jove</HI>'s Birth-place <HI>Crete,</HI> a fruitful Land,</L>
<L>I'th' middle of the Sea doth &s;tand.</L></Q></P>
<P>As to the Heavenly Bodies, it is &s;cituated un|der the beginning of the fourth Climate, &s;o that the longe&s;t day in a manner is but four|teen hours and a quarter. It hath on the Ea&s;t the <HI>Carpathian,</HI> on the We&s;t the <HI>Ionian,</HI> on the <HI>North</HI> the <HI>Aegean,</HI> and on the <HI>South</HI> the <HI>African</HI> or <HI>Lybian</HI> Sea. In form it extends Ea&s;t and We&s;t with three Promontories; that towards the Ea&s;t, called anciently <HI>Samonium,</HI> is now <HI>Capo di Salomone;</HI> that on the South-We&s;t looking towards <HI>Africa,</HI> formerly <HI>Her|maea,</HI> is now name'd <HI>Capo Gabra&s;&s;e;</HI> and that
<PB N="5" REF="5">on the North-We&s;t towards <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> of old called <HI>Cunarus,</HI> is now <HI>Capo Che&s;tin;</HI> this la&s;t being oppo&s;ite to <HI>Malta</HI> a <HI>Promontory of Laconia.</HI></P>
<P>The Soil is very fruitful, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e Wines which we call <HI>Mu&s;cadels,</HI> of which ac|cording to Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> they tran&s;port yearly twelve thou&s;and Butts: this Wine <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> calls <HI>Vinum Malviticum,</HI> &s;o nam'd from the Mountain <HI>Malva;</HI> he &s;aith it abounds herewith, and hath &s;tore of Cypre&s;s-Trees. There is al&s;o plenty of <HI>Gums, Honey, Sugar, Olives, Dates, Apples, Oranges, Lemons, Rai&s;ins, Melons, Citrons</HI> and <HI>Pomgranates.</HI></P>
<P>There are many other things at pre&s;ent worthy ob&s;ervation. Fir&s;t, that this I&s;land breeds no Serpent, Venemous, Ravenous, or hurtful Creature; &s;o that their Flocks graze &s;ecurely without a Shepherd. Secondly, if a Woman bites a man &s;hrewdly, it is not cured without difficulty; which if true, &s;aith the Noble Knight, then the la&s;t part of the forementioned priviledge, that it breeds no hurtful Creature, mu&s;t be fal&s;e. Thirdly, they have an Herb call'd <HI>Alinios,</HI> which if chewed in the mouth will keep a man from hunger that day. Fourthly, here is be&s;ides many other Phy&s;ical herbs, that called <HI>Dictamnum</HI> or <HI>Dictamnus,</HI> an excellent Antidote again&s;t Poy&s;on; which
<PB N="6" REF="6">is onely peculiar to this I&s;land. It af|fords al&s;o great &s;tore of <HI>Laudanum,</HI> a Juyce or Gum forced with incredible labour out of a Tree called <HI>Ci&s;tus,</HI> wherewith the Mountains abound: 'tis a &s;oporiferous Medicine, good to create Sheep, if pre&s;cribed according to art.</P>
<P>The cheife&s;t Mountain of note is <HI>Ida,</HI> now <HI>P&s;iloriti,</HI> &s;cituate in the mid&s;t of the I&s;land: here <HI>Jupiter</HI> is fabled to be privately nur&s;t, and from hence he is called <HI>Idaeus.</HI></P>
<P>Rivers of eminency they have few or none; the principal are <HI>Nilopotamus, Sca&s;inus, Epi|cidnus</HI> and <HI>Vivotro,</HI> towards the North; <HI>Popu|liar</HI> towards the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Liniens</HI> towards the We&s;t; but none of them are Navigable. The I&s;land is very populous, in&s;omuch that it is thought the <HI>Signiory</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> upon a &s;ud|den occa&s;ion can rai&s;e in it &s;ixty thou&s;and men able to bear Arms.</P>
<P>As to the Nature of the people, they have always had the repute of able <HI>Mariners;</HI> they being &s;cituated in the mid&s;t of the Sea, having very commodious Harbours and a Fi&s;h-trade; &s;o that when in tho&s;e times they would tax any per&s;on for relating an incredible &s;tory, they u&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>Creten&s;is ne&s;cit pelagus;</HI> meaning thereby, that the thing was as im|probable, as for one of <HI>Crete</HI> to be no <HI>Sailer:</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">yet this Virtue or Qualification of theirs was &s;tain'd with many notorious Vices, which they yet retain among them, as Malice, Envy and Lying; to which la&s;t they are &s;o addicted, that it grew proverbial to call a horrid Lye <HI>Cre|ten&s;e mendacium;</HI> and this fault the Poet <HI>Epi|menides</HI> did reprove in them (who was Na|tive of this I&s;land) cited by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus, Ch.</HI> 1. <HI>V.</HI> 12.</P>

<Q><L>The <HI>Cretans</HI> always lyars are,</L>
<L>&V;nruly Bea&s;ts, of labour &s;pare.</L></Q>
<P>To which may be added the Latine Proverb, <HI>Cretizare cum Creten&s;ibus,</HI> To deceive the De|ceiver, or to be fal&s;e in word and deed: as al&s;o, that of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>i. e.</HI> there are three Nations who&s;e names begin with the Greek letter K wor&s;e then any o|ther, <HI>viz.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>Cap|padocians, Cretans</HI> and <HI>Cilicians;</HI> though &s;ome apply it to the Cities of <HI>Corinth, Capua</HI> and <HI>Car|thage,</HI> beginning all with the &s;ame letter in that Language; all which were conceiv'd very dangerous to the State of <HI>Rome.</HI> Nor are the <HI>Candians</HI> at this day le&s;s &s;ick of their old Di&s;temper; for they are as great lyars, and as
<PB N="8" REF="7">idle as ever they were formerly, and avaricious withal, being very impatient of labour, not ca|ring to attain any Science perfectly; onely they are good Archers, being accu&s;tom'd to &s;hooting from their youth, and herein thought more dexterous and expert then the <HI>Turks</HI> them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>As to their Civil Government, according to <HI>Cluverius</HI> and <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> it was fir&s;t Monar|chical; they being governed by Kings till <HI>Q. Metellus</HI> did reduce the I&s;le (under his power) into a <HI>Province;</HI> and it remain'd under the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinopolitan Emperors,</HI> until the <HI>Saracens</HI> did over-run it with the re&s;t of <HI>Greece:</HI> but <HI>Baldwinus Earl of Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Emperour of Con&s;tantinople,</HI> did confer it upon <HI>Boniface Marque&s;s of Montferrat;</HI> from whom it was purcha&s;ed by the <HI>Venetians, Anno</HI> 1144, at a va&s;t rate, and continued ever &s;ince under the <HI>Signiory of Venice,</HI> under the name of <HI>Candia,</HI> till in the year 1669 it was &s;urrendred to the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>As to their <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Politie,</HI> they were fir&s;t converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith by St. <HI>Paul;</HI> who having planted the Go&s;pel there, left the watering of it to <HI>Titus,</HI> who by him was Con&s;ecrated Bi&s;hop of this I&s;le, recom|pending the Churches therein to his care, with power of <HI>Ordination</HI> and <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical

<PB N="10" REF="8">
<P>The Language vulgarly and generally &s;po|ken here, is the <HI>Greek Tongue;</HI> though Gentle|men and Merchants depending on the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;peak <HI>Italian</HI> al&s;o.

<P>The ground of this War between the <HI>Otto|man Emperour</HI> and the <HI>Venetian,</HI> I finde in an Epi&s;tolar addre&s;s to his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> from <HI>Venice,</HI> by the hand of a <HI>Noble man</HI> of this <HI>Nation</HI> then re&s;iding there, to be to this effect. <HI>It hath been the de&s;ign of the</HI> Turk, <HI>ever &s;ince the Conque&s;t of</HI> Rhodes <HI>and</HI> Cyprus, <HI>to gain the</HI> Kingdom of Candia; <HI>and that for this rea&s;on, becau&s;e then the</HI> Chri&s;tians <HI>being de&s;titute of all Harbours in the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>he might with the greater &s;ecurity fall upon them in the</HI> We&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1645 (when all Chri&s;tendom was at variance) <HI>Ibraim</HI> the Father of the now <HI>Tur|ki&s;h Monarch,</HI> in the depth of a long conti|nued peace, when lea&s;t expected, began this War by &s;etting upon the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and gave this out as the pretended cau&s;e of this Quar|rel.</P>
<P>In the former <HI>Agreement</HI> ratified and con|cluded between them, it &s;eems, among many other <HI>Articles</HI> that the <HI>Republick</HI> had tyed
<PB N="11" REF="8">them&s;elves up to perform, this was one, they did engage to deny the <HI>Knights of Malta</HI> &s;helter in any of their <HI>Ports</HI> or <HI>Harbours.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1644, it fell out that the Gallies of that Order &s;eiz'd a <HI>Sultana,</HI> and took her, who with three Millions of Crowns de&s;ign'd a Pilgrimage to <HI>Mecha.</HI> They &s;teering homewards laden with this rich booty, were com|pell'd by the un&s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the Weather, or for want of fre&s;h water, clancularly, and by &s;tealth, to &s;trike into a by-Port of <HI>Candia,</HI> whence after &s;ome refre&s;hment they return'd &s;afely to their own <HI>I&s;le.</HI></P>
<P>The next year the <HI>Turk</HI> furni&s;heth out a Fleet of 460 Sail great and &s;mall, &s;olemnly prote&s;ting to the <HI>Senates Amba&s;&s;adors,</HI> that the&s;e preparations were for the <HI>I&s;le of Malta;</HI> but when they had pa&s;t by them, and &s;teer'd a cour&s;e almo&s;t as far as <HI>Sapienza,</HI> they &s;ud|denly tackt about, and landed &s;ixty thou&s;and men, who immediately &s;ate down before <HI>Canea</HI> without the lea&s;t declaration of War. The <HI>Venetian</HI> being thus &s;o unexpectedly &s;ur|priz'd, made all po&s;&s;ible provi&s;ion to put them|&s;elves in a defen&s;ive po&s;ture; but before they could rouze their ancient and accu&s;tom'd courage, they lo&s;t the whole <HI>Kingdom,</HI> except <HI>Candia,</HI> and <HI>Carabu&s;a, Spina longa</HI> and <HI>Suda,</HI> three adjoyning In&s;ulets. The <HI>Grand Signior</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="9">being elated and puft up with this &s;ucce&s;s, gain'd by that happy crime (in his opinion) pro&s;perous treachery, own'd the War o|penly, and publickly declar'd the <HI>Senates</HI> &s;heltring of the <HI>Malte&s;es</HI> to be the cau&s;e; though 'twas privately decreed, that if they met with any con&s;iderable force or re&s;i|&s;tance in the fir&s;t a&s;&s;ault, that the <HI>Captain Ba&s;&s;a</HI> &s;hould lo&s;e his head (to pacifie the <HI>Senate</HI>) for attempting it without Order, and &s;o to per&s;wade them it was onely a <HI>Capricio</HI> of his own brain, and a plot of his own contrivance.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1648, they &s;oon were Ma&s;ters of the Field, and began the <HI>Siege</HI> of <HI>Candia</HI> with &s;o furious an on&s;et, that they made a breach and entred it, and for the &s;pace of &s;even hours vvere vvithin the <HI>Town;</HI> but the <HI>Defendants</HI> by their valour beat them out with infinite lo&s;s and damage.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1649, they made a &s;econd attempt, which proving fruitle&s;s and ineffectual, they then left it, never expecting to win it by &s;torm. On a ri&s;ing ground about three Miles from the old, they have built another Town, called <HI>New Candia,</HI> which is the Re&s;idence of the <HI>Turki&s;h Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> where they have &s;trongly fortified them|&s;elves, blocking up the <HI>City;</HI> &s;o that now there is no commerce at all but by Sea, which fur|ni&s;heth the <HI>Candiots</HI> with plenty of provi&s;ions, and all other nece&s;&s;aries what&s;oever.</P>

<PB N="14" REF="10">might play on them with their Cannon, and do execution: yet before he appear'd, the <HI>Turks</HI> had made an a&s;&s;ault, but were &s;o warm|ly, receiv'd, that they were, beat off with the lo&s;s of nigh 150 of their men which were left dead upon the place, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number of wounded per&s;ons which they brought off with them: and a few days after, made another a&s;&s;ault upon the <HI>Town;</HI> but <HI>Ge|neral Cornaro</HI> drew out of the <HI>Garri&s;on</HI> all the men privately in the night, undermining the <HI>Fort,</HI> with an intent to blow up the <HI>Turks:</HI> they came up furiou&s;ly to the Walls, but find|ing no <HI>Enemy</HI> grew jealous of the <HI>Stratagem</HI> and retreated, and in a &s;hort time &s;aw the <HI>Mine</HI> fired, which made them march farther into the Country; but the <HI>Venetian Forces</HI> returned to <HI>Spalatto,</HI> and there continued to ob&s;erve the <HI>Enemies</HI> motion</P>
<P>Little was done by them till towards the latter end of this in&s;tant <HI>September,</HI> at which time &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> were di&s;covered before <HI>Can|dia Nuova;</HI> but they onely fired a few Guns and returned back to their Quarters; the Gar|ri&s;on being well fortified, and furni&s;hed with men and provi&s;ions. At the &s;ame time they made an attempt upon <HI>Gradan,</HI> a &s;trong Fort near <HI>Marca&s;ca;</HI> but they were &s;o vigorou&s;ly entertained by the Be&s;ieged, that they were
<PB N="15" REF="10">forced to quit their Po&s;ts with the lo&s;s of four hundred men.</P>
<P>In <HI>October</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Canea</HI> took the Field vvith their peeces of Cannon, intending to leavy Contributions in the Country; and to prevent all information, &s;et &s;trong Guards up|on the adjoyning Sea-coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>Tovvards the latter end of this Month <HI>Signior Barbaro, Proveditor-General,</HI> arrived in <HI>Candia;</HI> his Predece&s;&s;or <HI>Signior Priuli</HI> being upon his departure to <HI>Dalmatia</HI> in the quality of General.</P>
<P>The <HI>Morlacks</HI> (vvho are <HI>Croats</HI> or <HI>Dalma|tians,</HI> &s;o called from the Hills where they formerly lived, being a &s;ort of people that for|&s;ook the Turki&s;h bondage, and put them&s;elves under the Senates Government) about this time made &s;everal incur&s;ions into the Turki&s;h Quarters vvith great &s;ucce&s;s, taking a con&s;ide|rable number of Slaves, and bringing &s;everal droves of Cattle along vvith them.</P>
<P>In <HI>November</HI> the Grand Signior declar'd his re&s;olution to make War with the Republique, by making preparations both by Sea and Land to attempt <HI>Candia</HI> the next Spring; to vvhich purpo&s;e he lays great Sub&s;idies upon his peo|ple throughout all his Dominions, and by his light Gallies hath landed &s;ome Forces in <HI>Canea.</HI> This month al&s;o the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="11">arrived in <HI>Canea,</HI> and was received with great joy, which the <HI>Turks</HI> manife&s;ted by many days fea&s;ting; who re&s;olved to take the Field as &s;oon as the Sea&s;on would permit, and to lay clo&s;e Siege to <HI>Candia:</HI> The <HI>Grand Signior</HI> him&s;elf giving all po&s;&s;ible incouragement to the Levies, and promi&s;ing extraordinary pay to tho&s;e that will li&s;t them&s;elves among the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> with an exemption from all Taxes and Sub&s;idies. The <HI>Turks</HI> preparati|ons being now very con&s;iderable for &s;ome weighty de&s;igne, the <HI>Senate</HI> doth &s;trengthen the City again it all attempts; and though it be &s;o well fortified by Nature, yet they defend|ed it with above 1700 pieces of Cannon, be|ing very well furni&s;ht with expert Veteran Of|ficers and Souldiers.</P>
<P>In <HI>December</HI> the <HI>Grand Vi&s;iers</HI> intentions to be&s;iege <HI>Candia</HI> are daily more and more di&s;co|vered, which occa&s;ion'd General <HI>Cornaro</HI> and Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> to go to <HI>Candia</HI> with a con&s;i|derable number of choice men to its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Towards the latter end of this Month the <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> lay about <HI>Retimo,</HI> having a Body of 40000 <HI>Turks</HI> drawn together in the Field; and the Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> di&s;po&s;ed all things in good order, and rai&s;ed &s;everal outworks which did very much contribute to the &s;trengthing of the City. About this time there was talk
<PB N="17" REF="11">of a Treaty, to make the Chri&s;tians carele&s;s in their defence.</P>
<P>In <HI>January</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> drew near <HI>Candia,</HI> and the Garri&s;on made &s;everal brisk Sallies with &s;ome lo&s;s to the <HI>Turks,</HI> in one of which <HI>Vertmiller</HI> was &s;lightly hurt. The <HI>Grand Vi&s;ier</HI> upon a general Mu&s;ter of his Forces in the I&s;le of <HI>Candia,</HI> found his Army con&s;i&s;ted of 23000 men, and i&s;&s;ued out Orders to all parts ad|joyning in the <HI>Turks</HI> Dominions, to ha&s;ten re|cruits of Men and Ammunition, in order to the &s;peedy be&s;ieging of <HI>Candia,</HI> and to ca&s;t &s;e|veral va&s;t Guns of extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, to be employed in that &s;ervice. The Chief <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> continued &s;till at <HI>Retimo,</HI> making all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for his intended de&s;ign; and &s;ent &s;everal of his Officers to take a view of the City and her Fortifications, which the Mar|qui&s;s did take daily care to &s;trengthen, and for the removal of all combu&s;tible matter out of the Hou&s;es, to avoid the execution of their Morter-pieces. Toward the latter end of this Month, the <HI>Venetian</HI> Convoy arrived at <HI>Candia,</HI> under the command of <HI>Semitecolo;</HI> and twelve Gallies laden with <HI>Bisket</HI> were &s;ent into <HI>Candia</HI> by the Admiral of their Fleet riding at <HI>Paros,</HI> who&s;e Squadrons were conti|nually crui&s;ing about the Sea to intercept the Provi&s;ions de&s;ign'd for the <HI>Turks.</HI> The Grand
<PB N="18" REF="12">Vi&s;ier was now indi&s;pos'd at <HI>Retimo,</HI> but or|dered the &s;trengthning of <HI>New Candia,</HI> intend|ing to rai&s;e a Battery near the <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> to hinder the pa&s;&s;age of the Republique's Ve&s;&s;els for the relief of the City; again&s;t which the <HI>Venetian</HI> Forces ca&s;t up a &s;trong Fort to beat them off, and prevent their nearer approaches. The <HI>Sultan</HI> then &s;ent fre&s;h commands to the <HI>Vi&s;ier,</HI> to imploy the utmo&s;t of his power and endeavours for the gaining of the Metropolis. The <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> being di&s;&s;atisfied with the former proceedings of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI>'s of <HI>Canea</HI> and <HI>Candia Nuova,</HI> he beheaded them both, and u&s;ed the like &s;erverity to &s;everal Officers, under pretence that they were wanting in the performance of their Duties the la&s;t Summer. He hath al|ways along with him the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> as Pay-ma&s;ter to the Army, who&s;e advice &s;ways extreamly with him in all matters of Importance. In the interim the <HI>Senate</HI> is &s;tu|dious to defend their Territories again&s;t the common Enemy. Now the Treaty that was &s;et on foot by the Prime <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> is wholly bro|ken off, being re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute the Siege vigorou&s;ly. The <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> about the latter of <HI>January,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> de|parted from <HI>Retimo</HI> to <HI>Candia Nuova,</HI> intend|ing to go back to <HI>Canea.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> laboured hard at the Batteries before <HI>Candia,</HI> and chiefly
<PB N="19" REF="12">that near <HI>Lazaretto,</HI> but with little &s;ucce&s;s; for the be&s;ieged plyed them very clo&s;ely from their new Fort, and made a Sally, forcing the <HI>Turks</HI> from their Batteries, killing five hundred upon the place, and taking forty &s;ix Pri&s;oners, with the lo&s;s of forty men onely. The Prime <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> now return'd to <HI>Canea,</HI> as 'twas thought to continue there, as a place of &s;ecurity during the Infection, the Plague raging &s;o violently in the Camp; and their Admiral <HI>Ba&s;&s;a</HI> to the <HI>Dardanellos</HI> with the major part of the Fleet.</P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> the Grand <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> in per&s;on with a party of <HI>Turks</HI> took a view of the Po&s;ts, the better to form his Leaguer again&s;t the City; but he was &s;o warmly entertained with Can|non, Morter-pieces, and Granadoes, that they fell into &s;ome di&s;order; which the Garri|&s;on perceiving, made a &s;mart Sally upon him, forcing him to quit the place and flee to <HI>Can|dia Nuova,</HI> leaving his Nephew &s;lain by a Cannon-&s;hot from the Walls dead upon the place, with other con&s;iderable per&s;ons. At <HI>Canea</HI> he remain'd in expectation of his Suc|cors of twenty thou&s;and men from the Grand <HI>Signior:</HI> and in the mean time the Garri&s;on threw down all the Works ca&s;t up by the <HI>Turks</HI> again&s;t the Town, and levelled all their Trenches.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="13">
<P>The Turki&s;h Army was now very much vi&s;ited with the Plague, and de&s;titute of Vi|ctuals, &s;o that the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> di&s;per&s;ed his Forces about the I&s;land. And much about this time, Signior <HI>Nicola Lyon,</HI> Commander of one of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ships, met with a Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;el laden with Provi&s;ions, under the Con|duct of &s;ix Gallies, who after an hours di&s;pute took her; at which the <HI>Vi&s;ier</HI> was &s;o highly incen&s;ed, that he took off the heads of &s;ix of the Captains, as being too remi&s;s, and want|ing duty and courage to defend her. Towards the latter end of this Month, the <HI>Turks</HI> with a con&s;iderable party Marched hear <HI>Candia,</HI> but were repul&s;ed with no incon&s;iderable lo&s;s; in which encounter two Renegadoes of note were taken pri&s;oners, and carried into <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> Signior <HI>Pada|vino,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, arriv'd at <HI>Canea;</HI> upon who&s;e approach, the Turki&s;h Forces by order from the Grand Vi&s;ier, being about 40000 in number, were drawn together in his view: al&s;o a Body of <HI>Turks</HI> a little af|ter came up to the Walls of <HI>Candia</HI> in a bravado, but were receiv'd &s;o &s;toutly by a party that Sallied out again&s;t them, that they were forced to quit their &s;tation in confu&s;ion and great di&s;order. In this Month, about the
<PB N="21" REF="13">middle thereof, a Turki&s;h Gallie carried off by the Chri&s;tian Slaves aboard of her, was brought into the Fleet: the manner of the &s;urpri&s;e was as followeth: There were 180 <HI>Turks</HI> and upwards aboard this Gally, with their Officers, among whom there hapned to be a Renegado <HI>Grecian,</HI> who proving a penitent Apo&s;tate, contriv'd this plot, to free him&s;elf and the Chri&s;tian Slaves con|demn'd to the Oars: He went down pri|vately into the Hold, and made &s;everal holes to let in the water; and having &s;o done, came ha&s;tily upon the Deck, crying out that the Ve&s;&s;el had &s;prung &s;o many and &s;o great Leaks, that it was irrecoverably lo&s;t: hereupon the <HI>Turks</HI> made immediately to a Rock not far off them, where they ran a&s;hore: the Slaves laying hold of this opportunity, row|ing off the Gally, &s;topped the Leaks, brought her to <HI>Paros,</HI> and pre&s;ented her to the Cap|tain-General; who pre&s;ently &s;ent two Gal|lies well arm'd and man'd to the Rock, where they took all the <HI>Turks</HI> (who were old Souldiers and per&s;ons of Eminency) five or &s;ix onely excepted, who were drown'd, endeavouring to &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wim|ming.</P>
<P>In <HI>March,</HI> &s;ome of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Ships &s;ucce&s;sfully engaged with the Caravan or
<PB N="22" REF="14">Convoy from <HI>Alexandria;</HI> the Admiral whereof had 300 &s;tout Souldiers aboard of him brought out of <HI>Barbary;</HI> the Ve&s;&s;el belonging to <HI>Tunis,</HI> which was commanded by the <HI>San&s;ack</HI> of <HI>Grand Cayro,</HI> or Viceroy of <HI>Egypt,</HI> who was by Orders from the Grand Signior to go to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Grand Vi&s;ier, and to take upon him the command of the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Canea:</HI> he brought with him 2000 Souldiers rai&s;ed upon his own ac|count to that purpo&s;e, with &s;everal Officers, who had made a &s;olemn vow to the Grand Signior to do their utmo&s;t in the War, and to lo&s;e their lives rather then to quit the Siege. This Ve&s;&s;el during the di&s;pute took fire, and was con&s;um'd with its fraught, to the value of 200000 Reals, and 50000 Zecchins de&s;igned to pay the Grand Vi&s;iers Army, be&s;ides the private Gold of the Of|ficers. Many of the men &s;eeking their &s;afe|ty in the Boat, were taken and made &s;laves; and &s;everal other Ve&s;&s;els of that Convoy fell into the Chri&s;tians hands with a con&s;i|derable Booty, and one among the re&s;t la|den with noble Hor&s;es for &s;ervice was taken by a Chri&s;tian Privateer that commanded a Pink. The Vi&s;ier hearing of this ill &s;uc|ce&s;s, cut off the heads of three Captains that arriv'd at <HI>Canea,</HI> and commanded ten
<PB N="23" REF="14">fre&s;h Gallies to re&s;cue the re&s;t of the Convoy, and conduct them &s;afe to <HI>Canea,</HI> upon pain of death.</P>
<P>About this time there was a Truce be|tween them for a &s;ea&s;on, for the repair of the Ruines on both &s;ides occa&s;ion'd by a dread|ful Earthquake that hapned on <HI>Holy-Thur&s;|day,</HI> and &s;everal others &s;ince: in the former, a great part of <HI>Albania</HI> &s;uffer'd; it threw down many Hou&s;es in <HI>Cattaro,</HI> with a great part of the Wall towards the Sea, de&s;troy|ing 600 per&s;ons at lea&s;t; and <HI>Buda</HI> was wholly &s;wallowed up, in which there pe|ri&s;hed the like number of people, both the&s;e places being &s;ubject to the Republique; and <HI>Dulcigno</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;tel Nuova,</HI> two places be|longing to the <HI>Turks,</HI> were both &s;unk; which was the cau&s;e of this Truce between the <HI>Ve|netian</HI> and the <HI>Turk.</HI></P>
<P>General <HI>Cornaro</HI> and the Marqui&s;s <HI>Degl' Oddi</HI> were imyloyed to repair the da|mages &s;uffered at <HI>Cattaro</HI> by this Earth|quake.</P>
<P>In the Month of <HI>April</HI> 1667, the Grand Vi&s;ier plained the Country for five Miles to|gether about the Port of <HI>Suda;</HI> cutting down the Trees and Vines, and driving a|way all the Cattle, that the Garri&s;on might not be &s;upplyed from tho&s;e parts: whil&s;t in
<PB N="24" REF="15">the mean time the people belonging to the Republique were very indu&s;trious, and fini|&s;hed &s;everal Out-works which did very much &s;trengthen <HI>Candia;</HI> be&s;ides, Captain-General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> &s;ent large Supplies of Pro|vi&s;ions and Moneys into the City in &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els commanded by Captain <HI>Gio. Moro&s;ini.</HI> But the Vi&s;ier finding his Army to con&s;i&s;t of 50000 men, having received &s;upplies from the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Court, rai&s;ed his Bat|teries again&s;t the Fort of St. <HI>Demetrius;</HI> who was manfully with&s;tood by the Defendants, with &s;ome lo&s;s to the Be&s;iegers. The <HI>Turks</HI> having found an opportunity to convoy forty Gallies with Souldiers and Ammuni|tion into <HI>Canea,</HI> were &s;o much incouraged hereby, that they a little after gave a bu&s;ie a&s;&s;ault to <HI>Suda,</HI> a con&s;iderable Fortre&s;s of the <HI>Venetians;</HI> but were beaten off with much &s;laughter.</P>
<P>In <HI>May,</HI> the Turki&s;h Saiques taking their way by the South-Sea, arrived at <HI>Gira Pe|tra,</HI> and put a&s;hore 5000 <HI>Jani&s;aries;</HI> which &s;o heartned the Army, that the Vi&s;ier re&s;olved upon the Siege of <HI>Candia:</HI> to this end he di&s;arm'd all the Gallies, imploying the Souldies in his Army, and the Slaves as Pioneers to work in the Trenches; and &s;peedily rai&s;ed three Batteries again&s;t the
<PB N="25" REF="15">three principal Bulwarks of that City; which the Chri&s;tians defended with extraordinary valour. But the Vi&s;ier being &s;en&s;ible of the Grand Signior's high di&s;plea&s;ure, attempted them with all his force, and played upon their Forts with his Batteries, intrenching 5000 men before the Fort St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> battering it with 100 of pieces of Cannon; he being then in expectation of the recruit of 8000 men from <HI>Morea:</HI> And the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina</HI> pre&s;&s;ed one man out of every Hou&s;e in all the Countries about him; ex|cepting <HI>Licia</HI> and <HI>Corbaccia,</HI> who denyed it, pretending their inability to go to War, by rea&s;on of a Famine lately among them. The <HI>Turks</HI> had now laid a clo&s;e Siege to <HI>Candia,</HI> battering it in four places; but the Vi&s;ier fir&s;t demoli&s;hed the Town of <HI>New Candia</HI> (formerly built by the <HI>Turks</HI>) becau&s;e that the materials thereof might be u&s;eful in rai&s;ing their Works, and to prevent his Souldiers retreating thither. The Ports again&s;t which he made his Batteries, were <HI>Bethlem, Sabionera, Je&s;us</HI> and St. <HI>Demetrius;</HI> the men imployed again&s;t them were 40000 in number, be&s;ides 12000 Pioneers. But the Chri&s;tians were much incouraged by the arri|val of the Convoy under the command of <HI>Gui|&s;tiniano,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary of the Provi&s;ions, who
<PB N="26" REF="16">had &s;ent 70000 Ducats into the Town, be|&s;ides all other nece&s;&s;aries, and brought with him 75000 more, which vvere conveyed to the Captain-General for the u&s;e of the Ar|mata. The Siege vvas very indu&s;triou&s;ly managed by the Grand Vi&s;ier, their Forces vvell ordered, and their Cannons continu|ally roaring; they gave a &s;tout a&s;&s;ault, but vvere repul&s;t with con&s;iderable damage. The Vi&s;ier being oblig'd upon his ovvn re|putation to hazard his vvhole Army, made &s;ix furious a&s;&s;aults upon the City, but vvas in all beaten off vvith the lo&s;s of 12000 men, at lea&s;t, in the&s;e attempts. For tvven|ty days time that the <HI>Turks</HI> had &s;pent in the Siege of <HI>Candia,</HI> they gained not &s;o much as one foot of ground; and their great Bat|teries and Cannon did little injury, being at too great a di&s;tance, and mounted too high, &s;o that by falling upon the highe&s;t Hou&s;es they onely beat off &s;ome Tiles, and threvv dovvn &s;ome Chimnies; vvhich vvas all the execution that vvas done. The Chri&s;tian Privateers did do the Republique excellent Service at Sea; among others one called the <HI>Notali,</HI> having &s;even hundred men a|board, took in fevv days above tvventy prizes.</P>
<P>General <HI>Villa</HI> made a lu&s;ty Sally out of
<PB N="27" REF="16"><HI>Candia</HI> vvith 2000 choice men, vvho fell upon one of the <HI>Turks</HI> Po&s;ts vvith &s;uch courage and re&s;olution, that he made a great &s;laughter among them, they being out of order; but at length rallying together, pur|&s;ued the General, vvho drevv them into a place prepar'd for that purpo&s;e, and then ordered the Mines to be fired; vvhich vvas &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully effected, that according to the information of a Renegado afterwards, near 3000 <HI>Turks</HI> were de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>On the 28 of <HI>May,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> began &s;ome violent attaques upon the Fort near <HI>Bethlem,</HI> and the Gate <HI>Panigra;</HI> and that morning they played upon the Bulwarks with two pieces of Cannon, which were an&s;wer'd by the Guns from their Counter-batteries and Courtines.</P>
<P>The 29 the Enemy made nearer approaches, and began with two Guns onely to batter the Bulwarks of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> but the Chri&s;tians with their Guns from the Gallies, and tho&s;e from the Works, play'd upon the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;o warmly, that they were di&s;ordered, and the Grand Vi&s;ier forced to change his Po&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 30 the <HI>Turks</HI> onely wrought hard to rai&s;e a Battery again&s;t St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Fort.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="17">
<P>The 31 the Enemy a&s;&s;aulted the Fort with great fury; and in that days &s;ervice Captain <HI>Galeazzo,</HI> an Officer of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> was un|fortunately &s;lain by a Shot in the Out-work of St. <HI>Maries,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Ca&s;taneuf;</HI> but the <HI>Savoyards</HI> under his command, to re|venge his death, did fall that night upon the <HI>Turks</HI> with Hand-Granadoes, Swords and Pi&s;tols, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome other Forces, and made a great confu&s;ion among them, com|pelling them to leave their Works with much di&s;order. The <HI>Savoyards</HI> followed them into one of their Redoubts, and &s;lew a con&s;iderable number of them; the Guns from the Town in the mean time play|ing upon the Enemy, to hinder their pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the fir&s;t, there was little or no action; onely the Enemies Cannon firing, di&s;mounted a Gun in the Fort <HI>Marti|nengo.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the &s;econd, they formed another Battery, and fired at the Be&s;ieged with two other pieces of Cannon, bringing up a Gal|liot with another Ve&s;&s;el to furni&s;h them with Provi&s;ions, wherewith they were la|den; and the <HI>Venetians</HI> &s;ent out two Gal|lies to ingage them, but they were &s;o &s;tout|ly defended by their Batteries, that the
<PB N="29" REF="17">Gallies were forced to betake them&s;elves to their own Fort for protection.</P>
<P>The &s;ame morning, the <HI>Turks</HI> laid an Am|bu&s;h near the Out-work of <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> to in|tercept the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and prevent the relief of their Guards; but they were valiantly re|&s;i&s;ted and put to flight, leaving many of them dead upon the place, be&s;ides tho&s;e that were kill'd in the retreat, which were more in number.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the third, the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;pent this morning in interring their dead, and in Fu|neral-Ceremonies; but that afternoon they fired very thick upon the Town, with Bullets of 80, 90, and 120 pound weight.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the fourth, they approached within a &s;tones ca&s;t of the Walls; and that night there was a re&s;olute skirmi&s;h before <HI>Panigra,</HI> where they were receiv'd with Volleys of Musket, and plenty of Cannon-&s;hot.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the fifth, in the morning, near the Works of St. <HI>Mary</HI> they rai&s;ed a new Bat|tery, playing upon the Be&s;ieged with four great Guns; and wrought very hard to ca&s;t up a Trench to &s;ecure a Pa&s;&s;age for their Ar|tillery, in which they were defended by a great number of Mu&s;queteers, drawn thi|ther for that de&s;igne; but they had &s;uch a
<PB N="30" REF="18">peal of Ordnance, Small-&s;hot and Grana|does from the Town, that they de&s;i&s;ted from their enterprize, with an extraordin|ary lo&s;s of men; the Be&s;ieged onely had &s;ome few Souldiers wounded, but lo&s;t not one man that day.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the &s;ixth, the Guns onely played on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh, the <HI>Turks</HI> plyed again their Works, and made their approaches with greater preparation then formerly, working under ground.</P>
<P>The eighth in&s;tant they rai&s;ed another Battery again&s;t St. <HI>Andrews</HI> Bulwark, and endeavoured the reparation of their old Battery at the <HI>Lazaretto;</HI> but the Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> ordered a Counter-battery well plant|ed with Guns to be made to &s;ecure the place, and in his retreat by the <HI>Mole,</HI> re|ceived a &s;light hurt in his hand by the flying of the Stones, occa&s;ion'd from Can|non-&s;hort that &s;trook upon the Walls. That night they made a Sally from the Half-moon of <HI>Mocenigo;</HI> where there was a &s;harp fight which continued for many hours, but concluded with great &s;laughter of the Ene|my by the Cannon and Morter-pieccs from the City-works.</P>
<P>On the nineteenth of <HI>July</HI> Signior <HI>Baroni</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="18">with two Gallies, and not long after Signior <HI>Carenzo Pi&s;ani,</HI> who was cho&s;en Proveditor for <HI>Candia,</HI> entred the Port with Succours for the City: and the &s;ame Evening his Ex|cellency Captain-General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> followed them <HI>Incognito</HI> with two Gallies more. He was at his landing near the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> received by Signior <HI>Barbaro</HI> with great joy, and all the Martial Ceremonies u&s;ual upon &s;uch oc|ca&s;ions; who pre&s;ented him with the Keys of the City; and with a great Train of Of|ficers and Souldiers, accompanied with Sig|nior <HI>Maro</HI> Proveditor to the Fleet; and the Proveditor of the I&s;le attended him to his Coach, and the Lodgings prepar'd for him: He pa&s;&s;ed under a Triumphal Arch erected in the great Street for him, being met al&s;o by the Cavalry at the Gates of the City, and &s;aluted by the great Guns; the whole City te&s;tifying their extraordinary joy and &s;atisfaction for his arrival, by their loud Acclamations and rare Fire-works.</P>
<P>The next morning the <HI>Turks</HI> at break of day di&s;charged a great Volley of Mu&s;quets and Cannon again&s;t the City, which the Be&s;ieged &s;corning to be indebted to them) return'd from the Walls.</P>
<P>The &s;ame morning Colonel <HI>Chateauneuf</HI> attaqued a Redoubt ca&s;t up by the Enemy
<PB N="32" REF="19">near <HI>Panigra,</HI> to give the Captain-General &s;ome &s;ignal te&s;timony of the courage and re&s;olution of the Be&s;ieged, and very freely threw his Hand-granadoes among them: but the <HI>Turks</HI> being prepar'd for their re|ception, i&s;&s;ued out, and pre&s;&s;ed very hard and clo&s;e upon them; yet they, being &s;e|conded by another party commanded by the Captains <HI>Ca&s;telli, Bonefort,</HI> and a third who&s;e name we have no certain knovvledge of, renewed their a&s;&s;ault, and did con&s;i|derable execution upon the <HI>Turks:</HI> but the Alarm being by this time grown warm, and great numbers coming to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, the <HI>Candiots</HI> retir'd to the Covert way of, the Fort <HI>Panigra,</HI> and the Enemy pur&s;ued them with great &s;houting; and notwith&s;tanding the Pali&s;adoes, and a Guard of forty Mu&s;queteers that play'd upon them with their Vollies, they were forc'd to leave their Colonel <HI>Chateauneuf</HI> behind them, and &s;helter them&s;elves in the Moat; but he with an incon&s;iderable number of Officers valiantly beat off the Enemy twice or thrice together, and was at la&s;t relieved by Ser|jeant Major <HI>Motta,</HI> who Sallying out of the Fort, beat back the <HI>Turks</HI> into their Re|doubt with a great &s;laughter; he him&s;elf receiving a &s;hot in the brea&s;t, but without
<PB N="33" REF="19">hurt, his Armor being well tryed, and of proof. In this attaque the Chri&s;tians came off with the lo&s;s of one Serjeant, two Soul|dies, and two others wounded.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time Colonel <HI>Martinom,</HI> Com|mander of <HI>Panigra,</HI> &s;ent out twelve Souldiers with Granadoes, and forty Foot-men com|manded by Major <HI>Bricheras</HI> Lieutenant, to a&s;&s;ault another Redoubt ca&s;t up on the right hand of the Fort; which they performed with great courage, beating out the <HI>Turks,</HI> and putting many of them to the Sword: but the Enemy growing more numerous, they retreated, their Lieutenant being &s;hot dead under the Redoubt, but like true Soul|diers, re&s;olving not to leave the Body of their Officer in the power of the Enemy, they return'd upon them, and with great va|lor forced them to give ground, taking up the Body, and retiring to their Works with much glory and renown.</P>
<P>The <HI>Savoyards</HI> al&s;o, being but 60 Officers and Souldiers, with Granadoes, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Torre,</HI> Sallied out from the <HI>Ravelin</HI> of <HI>Bethlem,</HI> and fell upon the Enemies Line, where a Body of <HI>Turks</HI> &s;tood upon their Guard to defend the Pioneers; and there hapned a very hot di&s;pute; but they &s;ending out a recruit
<PB N="34" REF="20">of <HI>Savoyards</HI> &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t them, the Enemy was beaten from the Line, and forced to &s;eek their &s;afety in &s;ome of their Redoubts, lea|ving 60 of their party dead upon the place, four of who&s;e heads the <HI>Candiots</HI> brought with them, and pre&s;ented to the Captain-General, who&s;e valour in this noble attempt was rewarded with forty Reals; and in this Service they were &s;o fortunate, as to come off with the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle Souldier. Co|lonel <HI>Arborio</HI> and <HI>Marino,</HI> with the Count <HI>Bru&s;ano</HI> Captain of the Guard to Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> &s;allied out of the Po&s;t of St. <HI>Mary,</HI> with a party of fifty men; forced the <HI>Turks</HI> out of two &s;everal Redoubts, kill'd a con|&s;iderable number of them, and lo&s;t onely one Serjeant.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o great execution done up|on the Enemy by a Squadron that i&s;&s;ued from the Fort of St. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who &s;laughtred many of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> being by this time &s;ufficient|ly &s;en&s;ible of their &s;ucce&s;sle&s;s procedings by Batteries and open force, were wholly bent upon their Mines, imploying con&s;tantly night and day ten thou&s;and Pioneers to work in them; whereupon they advanced greatly in their approaches, the drine&s;s of the Sea|&s;on contributing very much to their de|&s;ignes;
<PB N="35" REF="20">and laboured extreamly to meet with the Mines from the Out-works; &s;ome whereof the Chri&s;tians did &s;pring and blow up, which proved very fatal and de&s;truc|tive to the <HI>Turks.</HI> In the interim the great &s;hot fly very liberally on both &s;ides, but with little damage to the City, onely beating down the tops of &s;ome Churches and high Hou&s;es, with the lo&s;s of four or five per|&s;ons. The <HI>Turks</HI> &s;till plyed the City very clo&s;e with their Guns from the Batteries; and throwing Morter-pieces into the Town, with little lo&s;s to the Be&s;ieged, but great lo&s;s to the Be&s;iegers. The Chri&s;tian Cor|&s;ayres did very con&s;iderable &s;ervice by crui|&s;ing upon the Sea, and in the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> by which means they did infinitely inrich them&s;elves, having taken &s;everal great Prizes, and intercepted the Enemies Ve&s;&s;els which were laden with Provi&s;ions intended for their Armies &s;upply.</P>
<P>Now the Turks began to be very &s;paring of their Cannon-&s;hot, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to be for want of Powder; who finding little or no &s;ucce&s;s thereby, they fell to their Mines, and &s;prung one made under the Out-work of the <HI>Half-moon</HI> of <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> and entred the breach, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there|of; killing fifty Souldiers placed there to
<PB N="36" REF="21">defend it: The Enemy being elevated with this &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ent 3000 men to make good the place, of which they continued Ma&s;ters for the &s;pace of one day and a half; but Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> knowing that it might prove advantagious to them in attaquing the next Work, was re&s;olved to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them; and therefore he nobly i&s;&s;ued out with a Party of able Souldiers, and at the &s;ame time gave fire to a Mine, formerly made un|der it, though undi&s;covered by the Enemy, which blew up &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, that the Turks per&s;iht mo&s;t mi&s;erably in the ruines; and then the Marque&s;s falling in among the re&s;t, after a &s;harp and bloody fight of &s;ix hours continuance, beat them off, and re|gain'd the place, with the lo&s;s of 300 of his own men, and above 2000 Turks.</P>
<P>The next day the Grand Vi&s;ier, having had &s;o great a lo&s;s of his be&s;t Souldiers, called a Council of his principal Ba&s;&s;a's; where it was re&s;olv'd, that they &s;hould &s;end a Trumpeter to the Captain-General, to de|&s;ire that Signor <HI>Giaverina</HI> might come and treat with them in order to an agreement: but Colonel <HI>Vecchia</HI> went out in his &s;tead, they not approving of &s;ending out the for|mer at pre&s;ent; and he was courteou&s;ly receiv'd by the whole Army, but e&s;pecially
<PB N="37" REF="21">by the Vi&s;ier, who treated him with a co&s;tly Collation; telling him, That if his General wanted Provi&s;ions, he would freely &s;end him what his Camp did afford: but the Colonel after thanks return'd for his civil proffer, a&s;|&s;ured him that the City was &s;o plentifully &s;upplyed by the Fleet, that they could not &s;tand in need of any thing: he was &s;afely &s;ent back to the City, with much importu|nity that <HI>Giaverina</HI> might be admitted to treat with them; which vvas at la&s;t conde|&s;cended unto, and he vvas receiv'd by the Turks with great joy, vvho vvelcom'd him vvith all their Cannons, and &s;aluted him vvith &s;everal Mu&s;queteers; the general cry through the vvhole Camp being nothing but <HI>Peace, Peace.</HI> At this time the <HI>Vene|tians</HI> receiv'd very certain intelligence, that the Turks Army did not con&s;i&s;t of above 25000 men, the Svvord and Sickne&s;s having &s;vvept avvay the one half of their Army; though &s;uccours vvere daily expected from <HI>Morea.</HI> About this time the Captain Ba&s;&s;a vvas di&s;covered near the I&s;le <HI>Cerigo,</HI> vvhere he had landed &s;everal of his men, but the <HI>Venetian</HI> Gallies coming to ingage him, he put off to Sea with &s;uch ha&s;te, that he left 200 of his men behind him, vvhich vvere taken by the <HI>Candiots</HI> and made &s;laves.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="22">
<P>But this Treaty like the re&s;t &s;oon vani&s;h|ed, and came to nothing. The Turks con|tinuing &s;till their Works under-ground, put|ting all their confidence in the Mines, vvhich the Be&s;ieged laboured to fru&s;trate by their Counter-Mines; yet they applyed their greate&s;t force and Works again&s;t <HI>Panigra;</HI> labouring hard at their Mines, vvhich they often &s;prung on every &s;ide, and in the mean time plyed the Tovvn and Fort, e&s;pecially, vvith great and &s;mall &s;hot: but the Be|&s;ieged are not backvvard, either in the one or the other, &s;o that the Enemies de&s;igns prove un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Before <HI>Panigra</HI> the Turks rai&s;ed one very large Battery that had nine great Guns, from vvhence they played furiou&s;ly for ma|ny days together, and vvere an&s;vvered by the Be&s;ieged, vvith extraordinary lo&s;s to the Be&s;iegers; for above 12000 Turks peri&s;hed by the <HI>Candiots</HI> Sallies, Shot, Granadoes and Mines, with &s;everal Captains of Note, and ex|perienced Officers among them. The Veneti|ans having lo&s;t &s;ince the beginning of the Siege about 1000 men, with &s;ome Comman|ders; among whom <HI>Baron Baroni</HI> is one, vvho vvas kill'd by a Mu&s;quet-&s;hot on the 26 of <HI>July.</HI> And the Ladies, &amp; others of that tender Sex, did give as &s;ignal te&s;timonies of their
<PB N="39" REF="22">courage &amp; valour in the defence of the Town, as the men; among vvhom the Wife of Co|lonel <HI>Motta,</HI> vvho vvas Colone&s;s of the Regi|ment of Women, behaved her &s;elf vvith incredible re&s;olution and infinite courage; vvho&s;e death vvas much lamented, &s;he be|ing unhappily kill'd by the fall of a Wall, beaten dovvn by the Be&s;iegers Cannon; vvho &s;till are very intent upon the Siege, and approach nearer and nearer the Tovvn, by the daily &s;pringing of their Mines, &s;haking the vvhole City vvith the force of them; and are con&s;tantly a&s;&s;aulting, but as con&s;tantly repuls'd and beaten off; and 300 of them lo&s;t their lives, be&s;ides a great many more buried in their ovvn mines, by the blovving up of one of the Venetians Counter-mines. But the Turks by their frequently repeated and continued Batteries, had by this time made a great breach in the left Horn of the Fort <HI>Panigra,</HI> and another in that of <HI>Mo|cenigno;</HI> and on the eleventh of <HI>Angu&s;t</HI> they gave a violent a&s;&s;ault to both; and to divert the <HI>Candiots,</HI> did at the &s;ame time &s;torm the Tovvn at &s;everal other places; but by the courage of the Be&s;ieged vvere e|very vvhere repuls'd vvith great &s;laughter; the Be&s;iegers leaving many of their dead behind them, vvho&s;e heads adorn the
<PB N="40" REF="23">Hou&s;es of the Venetian Officers, vvherevvith they are &s;et round, as Trophies of their Va|lour, and revvards of their re&s;olution. Yet the Turks are no vvays di&s;couraged, but are principally incouraged by a Renegado Je|&s;uit called <HI>La Grange,</HI> who is courteou&s;ly en|tertain'd by the Vi&s;ier, and wholly &s;way'd by his advice.</P>
<P>The Turks now make u&s;e of &s;everal Gunners that are Chri&s;tians, whom they have compell'd into their &s;ervice by force, or drawn them in by flattery; and to ter|rifie the re&s;t, they cut off the head of one of them, who was &s;u&s;pected not to have fired his Gun to the be&s;t advange. They &s;till continued &s;pringing of their Mines; which occa&s;ions many daily &s;harp encoun|ters; and the courage of the <HI>Candiots</HI> is as frequently &s;ignaliz'd by the great &s;laughter of the Turks: which &s;o incen&s;ed the Vi|&s;ier, that he commanded a general a&s;&s;ault, which was perform'd with a noi&s;e as great as their fury, and for a con&s;iderable time continued with much ob&s;tinacy; but they finding the greate&s;t lo&s;s to be their own, and the Defendants incon&s;iderable; the Vi&s;ier gave over the a&s;&s;ault, who&s;e trouble and almo&s;t de&s;pair is encrea&s;ed by the great wants of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions in the Camp,
<PB N="41" REF="23">and the difficulty of being &s;upplyed, by rea|&s;on of the indefatigable indu&s;try &amp; diligence of the Venetian Squadrons, who &s;o continual|ly. crui&s;e before <HI>Canea,</HI> that they cannot &s;teal in with their Ve&s;&s;els: in&s;omuch that the Turks grew full of de&s;pondencie, con&s;idering that in &s;o long a Siege, after &s;o many men lo&s;t, &s;o many a&s;&s;aults made, and &s;o many Mines &s;prung, they had not as yet made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of any one Out-work of the Chri&s;ti|ans; and though the Turks were in great wants, yet the Venetians were de&s;titute of nothing that was nece&s;&s;ary, either of men, money, Ammunition, or any other Provi&s;ions what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But the Turks &s;till made daily a&s;&s;aults, &s;pringing fre&s;h Mines; yet by the prudence and conduct of the Be&s;ieged, their attempts have been fru&s;trated. Now the Turks Can|non had torne &s;ome hou&s;es, and beat down &s;ome part of their Walls; but the great num|ber of Granadoes &s;hot from the Enemies Morter-pieces, did the greate&s;t prejudice to the Town.</P>
<P>Now the Captain-general, for prevention of all &s;urprizes, commanded all his Souldiers to keep their Po&s;ts allotted them, by a ve|ry &s;trict Proclamation; and Ordered that all &s;orts of Victuals &s;hould be &s;old near the
<PB N="42" REF="24">Walls of the Town, to remove all pretences for their ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>Then the Turks rai&s;ed a Battery near the Po&s;t, but to no purpo&s;e; and bent the mo&s;t con&s;iderable force they had again&s;t the Out-works of <HI>Mocenigo</HI> and <HI>Panigra,</HI> and did them &s;ome damage by the often &s;pring|ing of Mines, and chiefly that of <HI>Panigra.</HI> At this time Signior <HI>Giu&s;tiniano</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary of the Victuals, with two other Officers, were kill'd by the blowing up of one of them, which wholly de&s;troyed the Left-horn of <HI>Panigra:</HI> and another Mine blew up the Counter&s;carp. Upon an exact view of all the Souldiers in the City, it was found that about 1500 had been killed &s;ince the Siege; but that there were &s;till above 10000 able men left to defend the place.</P>
<P>Now the Grand Vi&s;ier being more intent then ever upon the taking of the City, gave order that materials for building Huts and Lodges convenient for the Souldiers, &s;hould be brought to the Leaguer, intending to lye before the Town all the Winter; re&s;olving not to rai&s;e the Seige till he had either ta|ken the Town, or lo&s;t his whole Army in the Attempt.</P>
<P>And the Turks having made their ap|proaches
<PB N="43" REF="24">proaches to the Half-moon of <HI>Mocenigo</HI> and the Fort <HI>Panigra,</HI> lodged them&s;elves in the Trenches thereof; and in a &s;mall time &s;prung &s;everal Mines under each Work, which took &s;o effectually, that a wide breach was made in both places; and the &s;ame night they immediately made a de&s;perate a&s;&s;ault, appearing in great numbers upon the breaches, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome white upon their Armes: but the Be&s;ieged being very well prepar'd to receive them, the Turks, after a &s;mart fight, were forced by the Gar|ri&s;on to give over the Attempt, with a great lo&s;s of men, and &s;ome Colours. So that the Enemy being &s;o con&s;tantly defeated in their de&s;igns upon the Out-works, have given over tho&s;e places, being much di&s;couraged by their great lo&s;&s;es. The Vi&s;ier therefore commanded the Pioneers to undermine the Town-ditch; which the Chri&s;tian Officers ob&s;erving, by their Counter-mines within endeavoured to defeat them, and with great good &s;ucce&s;s met with one of their Gal|leries, which they ab&s;olutely ruin'd, and bu|ried the Turks therein that were imployed in that bu&s;ine&s;s. The <HI>Candiots</HI> about this time received a recruit of 2000 Souldiers, and 200000 Crowns for their encourage|ment.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="25">
<P>In <HI>September,</HI> the Grand Vi&s;ier finding that his Souldiers, e&s;pecially the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> were ready to break out into a mutiny, and threatned to leave the Siege, being impati|ent at the tediou&s;ne&s;s thereof, re&s;olv'd to put things to a &s;peedy i&s;&s;ue; and therefore commanded a general a&s;&s;ault to be made, which was accordingly executed. The Turks did &s;torm the Breaches very furiou&s;ly; but were re&s;i&s;ted &s;o valiantly by the Be&s;ieged, that after a fierce and bloody di&s;pute, they gave over with the lo&s;s of 7000 men: The Chri&s;tians lo&s;s was al&s;o great, who had 1500 of their men &s;lain; among whom were five Noblemen of <HI>Venice,</HI> who with great honour &s;old their lives in a defen&s;ive War again&s;t the Common Enemy of Chri&s;tianity. The Turks finding their labour fruitle&s;s, notwith|&s;tanding their endeavours to lodge them|&s;elves in the breaches of <HI>Panigra</HI> and <HI>Moce|nigo;</HI> have &s;ince &s;pent their time in fil|ling the Trenches between the Bulwarks of tho&s;e two Forts, to hinder all communi|cation between them; and to that purpo&s;e they had brought thither a great quantity of earth, though with con&s;iderable lo&s;s and danger; and were in hopes to make a pa&s;|&s;age to the left Angle of the Fort <HI>Panigra,</HI> where they had made the wide&s;t breach;
<PB N="45" REF="25">but the Be&s;ieged, to fru&s;trate their de&s;ignes, appear'd upon the breach with a party of &s;elect Souldiers, and a certain number of Slaves taken out of the Gallies that rid then in the Harbour, who behav'd them|&s;elves &s;o couragiou&s;ly, that the Enemy re|treated; and the Chri&s;tians in the interim ca&s;t up &s;o &s;trong a defence in that part of the breach, clearing all to the Trench, and throwing out the Earth they ca&s;t in, that there was little encouragement for a &s;e|cond attempt: be&s;ides, they placed a Ma|chine over again&s;t the Breach, (which was the invention of Captain-General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI>) which was Mu&s;quet-proof, and could con|tain 20 Souldiers; where they might &s;afely manage their Arms to defend the Breach. Many Mines were daily &s;prung, and one of the Chri&s;tians did notable execution, where by blowing up twelve Barrels of Powder, there happened a great &s;laughter among the Turks; and many of their bodies were thrown into the Trench.</P>
<P>The Be&s;ieged al&s;o made many &s;ucce&s;s|ful Sallies, and to their great encourage|ment had receiv'd a &s;upply of two thou|&s;and men, with &s;tore of all nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ions, that arrived &s;afe at <HI>Candia</HI> in their Convoy, which con&s;i&s;ted of twelve Ships:
<PB N="46" REF="26">This made them re&s;olve upon a general Sallie out of the City, which was perform|ed with great lo&s;s to the Turks. The Enemy being almo&s;t tyred out with the Siege (e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Jani&s;aries</HI> and <HI>Spahi</HI>) their Army bring reduced from 60000 to 20000, were re&s;olv'd to quit the Siege; yet the Vi&s;ier by his great diligence and large promi&s;es per|&s;wades them &s;till to continue at the Siege, where they &s;till beat the Town vvith their Ordnance.</P>
<P>But among other late adventures, in <HI>October,</HI> about four Gally-&s;laves, belonging to the Venetian, being imployed in one of the Out-vvorks, di&s;covered about 100 Turks dravving near them in a Body; vvhereupon one of them, vvho&s;e name vvas <HI>Bre&s;&s;ano,</HI> making him&s;elf Captain, encouraging his Companions, and taking &s;uch vveapons as came next to hand, i&s;&s;ued out upon the Turks vvith great re&s;olution; kill'd 30 of them in a very &s;mall time, vvounded many of the re&s;t, and put them all to flight for their &s;afety: <HI>Bre&s;&s;ano</HI> having in this Sally given a &s;ufficient te&s;timony of his great courage, by killing 16 of them vvith his ovvn hand. The Captain-General at this very in&s;tant &s;tand|ing upon the Walls, and ob&s;erving all pa&s;|&s;ages, &s;ent for him, and commending him

Much a|bout this time an <HI>Aga</HI> with four Turks fled into <HI>Candia,</HI> with a con&s;iderable &s;um of money; and ten or twelve thou&s;and Turks had quitted the &s;ervice, being weari|ed with expectation, and tir'd out with the Siege; which extreamly incen&s;ed the Vi&s;ier; yet he gave order for the repair of the Fort of <HI>New Candia,</HI> which he at his fir&s;t &s;et|ting down before the City had demoli&s;hed as altogether u&s;ele&s;s; being re&s;olv'd to &s;pend the whole Winter in lying before the Town: and in order thereunto, &s;ent out &s;e|veral di&s;patches into <HI>Egypt, Barbary,</HI> and all other places in the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; threatning the Ba&s;&s;a's with &s;evere and pre|&s;ent puni&s;hment, if not ab&s;olutely and &s;peedily obey'd.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior was now arriv'd at <HI>Morea</HI> in per&s;on, to ha&s;ten the tran&s;porta|tion of fre&s;h forces, intending to &s;ummon together the whole &s;trength of his Empire, rather then de&s;ert the Siege di&s;honourably. Yet notwith&s;tanding the great lo&s;&s;es of men, the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the Siege, the fru&s;trating
<PB N="48" REF="27">of their de&s;ignes in their a&s;&s;aults above, and the &s;ucce&s;sle&s;&s;ne&s;s of their Mines under ground, the impatience of the Grand Sig|nior, maugre all di&s;couragement what|&s;oever, they &s;till engage in many warm di&s;putes, and endeavour to fill up the Trenches; but the Be&s;ieged &s;till beat them off, and throw out what they ca&s;t in: but the Chri&s;tian Officers lookt upon this as prejudicial, and time ill &s;pent, &s;eeing the Enemy from one of his Batteries planted upon the Counter&s;carp, de&s;troyed their Blinds, and laid them open to their Small-&s;hot; therefore they re&s;olv'd to de&s;troy the Battery, and imployed the Pioneers to that purpo&s;e, who &s;prung a large Mine, which blew it up wholly, with a great number of Turks, burying all their Cannons in its ruines, together with the <HI>Mu&s;tapha</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, <HI>Beilerbeg</HI> of <HI>Anatolia,</HI> one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable per&s;ons among them, and who chiefly advis'd the carrying on the Siege on that &s;ide of the City. Several other Mines were &s;prung the day following on both &s;ides, by which the <HI>Panigra</HI> was totally de&s;troy'd, and reduc'd to a heap of rubbi&s;h, though &s;till defended with infinite valour; the Chri&s;tians appearing in white Armor, to the terror of the Enemy. After this, the Be|&s;ieged
<PB N="49" REF="27">made many Sallies, and in their re|treat drew the Enemy over Mines which were prepar'd for them; and when the Chri&s;tians &s;aw their opportunity, fir'd them with great execution, and in little time beat them to their &s;econd Redoubt, returning with Arms and Baggage in all their Sallies. Yet the Turks by the approaches of their Galleries made their advances with great ob&s;tinacy, &s;pringing divers Mines upon the Trenches of the City, with great damage to the Pali&s;adoes of the <HI>Falsbray</HI> near ad|joyning; but the Chri&s;tians, by their indu|&s;try, placed new Pali&s;adoes on the <HI>Falsbray:</HI> The Turks &s;till working their Mines with all the &s;ubtilty imaginable; one whereof they &s;prung, which was under the <HI>Half-moon</HI> at the right-hand of the <HI>Panigra,</HI> which al|mo&s;t fill'd a part of the Trench near the Front of the Bulwark <HI>Bethlem</HI> with its ruines; of which the Turks were re&s;olv'd to make the be&s;t advantage they could, and that very night were making preparati|ons for a &s;torm; but there fell &s;uch violent rain in the night, that they were forced to de&s;i&s;t. Afterwards they &s;prung another Mine in the <HI>Graft,</HI> which removed many Pali&s;adoes, and endangered the per&s;on of the Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa.</HI> Another Mine of the E|nemies
<PB N="50" REF="28">which was ready to &s;pring, was hap|pily di&s;covered by the Chri&s;tians, and the Powder remov'd: the Enemy afterwards, when they thought it convenient, fir'd the Train, being big with expectation of the i&s;&s;ue; but they were &s;et upon by a party of the Be&s;ieged, who al&s;o gave fire to two Mines of their own near <HI>Mocenigo,</HI> and one of 35 Barrels of Powder, which over|whelm'd many Turks in the ruines, and di&s;|ordered their Mines in tho&s;e places.</P>
<P>Now the Garri&s;on having receiv'd a con|&s;iderable &s;upply of fre&s;h Souldiers and &s;ome Hor&s;e, they made a re&s;olute Sally; and the Turks drawing up all their forces, main|tain'd the di&s;pute two hours together; but they were at la&s;t beaten into their own Trenches, with great lo&s;s of their chief Captains and Commanders, be&s;ides private Souldiers; the Grand Vi&s;ier him&s;elf e&s;ca|ping not without great hazzard of his life, or impri&s;onment. The Turks Army being now reduced to 18000, were re&s;olv'd upon a <HI>dernier effort,</HI> and to make a general Sally; but were repuls'd with great &s;laughter.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the <HI>Turk</HI> had made &s;everal experiments of the valor of the <HI>Candiots,</HI> by A&s;&s;aults and Skirmi&s;hes which prov'd un&s;ucce&s;sful, he endeavour'd to obtain by
<PB N="51" REF="28">&s;tratagem what he could not do by force; to which end they &s;hot &s;everal Arrows in|to the City, to which they had fa&s;tned Let|ters, both in <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Italian,</HI> which con|tain'd many Arguments to per&s;wade the Chri&s;tians to a &s;urrender, bragging of their Supplies they &s;uddenly expected, re&s;olving not to quit the Siege; menacing them, up|on their refu&s;al, with all the extremities us'd by an incen&s;ed Enemy.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth of <HI>November,</HI> in the E|vening, the Grand Vi&s;ier di&s;charged all his Cannon, which were &s;econded with five Volleys of Mu&s;queteers, three of them with Bullets, and two without; accompanied with great &s;houts, and &s;etting up many Lights about the Camp; which made the Chri&s;tians jealous of &s;ome large Succours &s;ent them, or &s;ome extraordinary expecta|tion from their Mines: but they drew up their men, and commanded them to &s;tand all night to their Arms; and in the morn|ing they found it onely to be a Turki&s;h Ro|domontado, a meer Artifice of the Grand Vi&s;iers, by throwing out reports of Succours and Supplies, to rai&s;e the drooping &s;pirits of the Souldiers.</P>
<P>The &s;ixteenth of <HI>November,</HI> being the Anniver&s;ary of St. <HI>Giu&s;tina,</HI> on which in
<PB N="52" REF="29">the year 1570, the Chri&s;tians gain'd a glo|rious Victory again&s;t the Turks, was cele|brated by the Be&s;ieged with as much true zeal and joy, as that of the Turks the day before was counterfeit and feigned. Some few days after, the Grand Signior &s;ent the Vi&s;ier a Ve&s;t and Scimiter as a pre&s;ent; which he receiv'd, with &s;ome Moneys for the Souldiers pay, which made them repeat the like Triumphs throughout the whole Turki&s;h Camp.</P>
<P>After this, the Chri&s;tians made a large Mine without, the <HI>Raveline di Samo Spirito,</HI> divided into three parts, which they &s;prung &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly, that it ruin'd their Redoubts and Lines, blew up their Bodies in the Air, and entomb'd others of them in its ruines; which was followed by a &s;tout Sally, to the de&s;truction of many Turks, and &s;ome Commanders of Eminencie. At which the Vi&s;ier was &s;o much inrag'd, that he re&s;olv'd to win the Town, or lo&s;t his life in the attempt; &s;ending to all his Ba&s;&s;a's through|out the Grand Signiors Dominions, for all &s;upplies of Provi&s;ions they could po&s;&s;ibly furni&s;h him withal.</P>
<P>The Turks having gain'd the ruin'd Out-works of <HI>Panigra,</HI> advanced with their Mines and Galleries towards the great
<PB N="53" REF="29">Trench; but a con&s;iderable &s;laughter hapned among the Turks, by the frequent &s;pringing of the Mines, and numerous Sallies that were daily made: but Signior <HI>Lorenzo Pi|&s;ani,</HI> the Proveditor of <HI>Candia,</HI> was &s;lain by one of their Morter-pieces; and that Noble Venetian <HI>Bertolo Pi&s;ani</HI> unfortunate|ly kill'd by a &s;hot. Yet the rains falling &s;o exce&s;&s;ively upon them, the Grand Vi&s;ier, withdrew, leaving about 6000 men behind him to defend the Batteries, and other Works.</P>
<P>Much about this time, Secretary <HI>Giavarina,</HI> Mini&s;ter of State to the Venetians, who had continued &s;ome time in the Grand Vi&s;iers Camp, lodged in the Tents of <HI>Caterzogolo,</HI> which was a place of bad air, died, and five or &s;ix of his Family; which might be occa&s;ion'd by the Contagion that raged &s;o violently among the Turks.</P>
<P>The City was now in a good condition, by rea&s;on of their con&s;tant &s;upplies from the Fleet; but the Turks endeavoured to make good their Po&s;t in the ruines of the Fort <HI>Pa|nigra:</HI> and the Venetian General ordered a new Line to be drawn in the old Works, to the end that the Be&s;ieged might be in a capacity to defend every part of the Town &s;ufficiently, if the Turks (according to their
<PB N="54" REF="30">menaces) &s;hould imploy their whole power again&s;t <HI>Candia</HI> the next Sum|mer.</P>
<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier being now retir'd with the major part of his Army into the Vale of <HI>Giofiro,</HI> the 6000 men that he left, &s;till employed them&s;elves about the defence of tho&s;e Po&s;ts that they had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the Be&s;ieged minding, during this vacancy, the prepration of their Works, and clearing their Trenches: but the Vi&s;ier &s;ent &s;ome additional Forces, and plenty of Provi&s;ions from the Walls, where the gro&s;s of the Army retir'd, with expre&s;s orders to lo&s;e no opportunity of gaining upon <HI>Candia;</HI> which &s;o encouraged them, that about <HI>Chri&s;t|mas</HI> they made frequent a&s;&s;aults, and were as frequently beaten off; but on St. <HI>Ste|phens</HI> day there was a great di&s;pute; the Be&s;ieged i&s;&s;uing out in white Arms, de&s;troy|ed a great number of the Enemy.</P>
<P>In <HI>January</HI> the Turks quitted all their Batteries before <HI>Candia</HI> but two, and &s;ent mo&s;t of their Cannon into <HI>Candia Nuova:</HI> and at this time there dyed among them near 200 in a day of the Plague; which made the Vi&s;ier retire ino <HI>Canea,</HI> &s;ending his &s;ick and wounded Souldiers into <HI>Napoli di Malva&s;ia.</HI></P>
<PB N="55" REF="30">
<P>The Chri&s;tian General re&s;olving now upon a Sally, drew out a &s;trong party, fell upon the Enemies Redoubts, and put the Turks to their heels; with a great lo&s;s of men on their part, and but forty of the Be|&s;ieged. Now the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Morea,</HI> had rai&s;ed a Body of 8000 Turks, who were ready to be imbarqued for <HI>Canea;</HI> but they in their way &s;eeing 3000 Turks wounded; who were conveyed in Carts to &s;everal Ho&s;pitals in <HI>Morea,</HI> prepar'd for their reception; this &s;ight made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion upon them, that they all quitted the &s;ervice, flee|ing into the Mountains for &s;afety, and leaving their Bag and Baggage behind them; declaring their unwillingne&s;s to en|gage in &s;uch de&s;perate &s;ervice, where an Army of 60000 that &s;ate down before <HI>Candia</HI> at fir&s;t, was already reduc'd to 16000. But the Grand Signior re&s;olv'd to employ all his Forces, both by Sea and Land, for the carrying on of the War a|gain&s;t <HI>Candia;</HI> and therefore di&s;patched two Chiauces to <HI>Tunis,</HI> and &s;ome other parts of <HI>Barbary,</HI> to command all a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Shipping, that they could po&s;&s;ibly afford him; but he receiv'd a cold and di&s;&s;ati&s;|factory an&s;wer, by way of excu&s;e.</P>
<P>In <HI>February</HI> the Turks having receiv'd
<PB N="56" REF="31">&s;ome Supplies, renewed the Siege, and ca&s;t up a large Fort at the <HI>Sabionera,</HI> and planted many pieces of Ordnance thereon, where|with they played very hard upon the Port and Town, but with very incon&s;iderable damage.</P>
<P>Towards the latter end of this Month, a Renegado that commanded a Body of two thou&s;and Turks, endeavoured to &s;ur|prize the Fort St. <HI>Andre;</HI> but the Mar|qui&s;s <HI>Villa</HI> having timely notice of their de&s;igne, &s;ent Colonel <HI>Motto</HI> with a con&s;i|derable number of able and re&s;olute men, who a&s;&s;aulted the Enemy &s;o couragiously, that they &s;lew 500 of them upon the place, put the re&s;t to the rout, and with a very &s;mall lo&s;s return'd with 50 heads to the Town. Now the City had receiv'd a con&s;iderable &s;upply of men; and Captain <HI>Molino</HI> having made a di&s;covery of five of the Turki&s;h Gallies coming out of the <HI>Dardanelloes,</HI> having aboard them men and Ammunition for the Grand Vi&s;ier, cha&s;ed them with his Squadron for &s;ome hours, and &s;unk two of them, the other three run aground upon one of the I&s;lands to a|void him, where they were broken in pieces, but the men e&s;caped.</P>
<P>The Turks about this time got many
<PB N="57" REF="31">Ships together, with Supplies intended for <HI>Canea;</HI> but they under&s;tanding that the Chri&s;tians Fleet was crui&s;ing about tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, were forced to flee into <HI>Rhodes</HI> for &s;helter, and there expect the opportunity of a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age. Yet notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e di&s;couragements, they continued their Mines, and attempted to make a way through the <HI>Graft,</HI> that they might a&s;&s;ault the Town with the le&s;s difficulty; but by the vigilancy of the Defendants, at this very time, two of the Galleries made near one of the Principal Bulwarks of the Town, were blown up by the Chri&s;tians Counter|mines.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior appear'd &s;till more active in, and intent upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Siege then ever, drawing up great numbers of men in all places, intending to make them in all 100000 &s;trong; and to employ 100 Gallies, and fifty other Ships of force in the Service, with a great &s;upply of all nece&s;&s;aries to the effecting of &s;uch a work.</P>
<P>On the eighth of <HI>March,</HI> &s;even Venetian Gallies crui&s;ing in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> were &s;et upon in the night by twelve under the com|mand of <HI>Durach Bey,</HI> a famous Cor&s;aire; but &s;ome other Chri&s;tian Ve&s;&s;els coming
<PB N="58" REF="32">opportunely to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance: the Admi|ral took &s;even of them, which he &s;ent in|to the Port of <HI>Candia,</HI> &s;unk three, &s;o that there onely e&s;cap'd two, very much di&s;abled. In which Naval engagement the Chri&s;tians lo&s;t 400 men, and among the re&s;t Signior <HI>Daniel Giu&s;tiniano</HI> the Pay-ma&s;ter; <HI>Fo&s;carini,</HI> one Captain of a Gally, and &s;ix other Of|ficers were wounded; but there fell of the Turks <HI>Durach Bey</HI> him&s;elf, and &s;ome other per&s;ons of note, with a great number of men; four hundred and ten Pri&s;oners were taken, and 1100 Chri&s;tians and upwards freed from Turki&s;h &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>April,</HI> 1668, <HI>Georgio Maria Vitali</HI> was by the Senate made Knight of the Order of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> for his &s;ervice again&s;t the Turks.

<P>In this Month the Captain Ba&s;&s;a being at Sea with forty Gallies, and five men of War of <HI>Barbary,</HI> met with Cavalier <HI>Georgio Maria Vitali,</HI> a Privateer of great renown; who not at all con&s;idering the va&s;t di&s;parity and di&s;advantage in the number and &s;trength both of Ships and Men , entertain'd them with infinite courage, and defended him&s;elf for the &s;pace of thirty &s;ix hours again&s;t them; &s;hattering many of, the Enemies Gallies, and de&s;troying a multitude of their men; but in the end was him&s;elf unfortunately &s;lain with a Cannon-&s;hot, having of 500 men but &s;ix remaining; his Ship being ex|treamly torn, fell into the hands of the Ene|my, with Goods and Money, to the value of two hundred thou&s;and Reals.

<P>On <HI>Saturday, July</HI> the twenty eighth, <HI>S.N.</HI> the Senate made choice of his Excel|lency <HI>Girolome Battaja,</HI> a per&s;on of prodigi|ous

<P>Signior <HI>Ale&s;&s;andro Molino</HI> was made by the Senate Captain of the Venetian Fleet in the <HI>Levant,</HI> to &s;ucceed in the Dignity of <HI>Cen&s;or;</HI> and they al&s;o made choice of Sig|nior <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">deo Moro&s;ini</HI> to &s;ucceed him in the Fleet.</P>
<P>The Turks had now given a furious a&s;|&s;ault to the City, which was continued a whole night; the chiefe&s;t force being im|ployed again&s;t the Fort of <HI>Sabioneca;</HI> but were repuls'd with incredible valor. In this attempt they were thought to lo&s;e 1500 men at lea&s;t; with &s;everal Officers of note: of the defendants, there dyed about 200, with whom Colonel <HI>Aldobrandi,</HI> a per&s;on of an undaunted &s;pirit, lo&s;t his life.</P>

<PB N="71" REF="38">the three <HI>Kings,</HI> the <HI>Mary,</HI> the <HI>Contarino,</HI> and the <HI>Golden Palm,</HI> commanded by the <HI>Sieur de Lionne;</HI> and after a &s;evere and &s;mart fight, one of the Enemies Ve&s;&s;els being grappled with the <HI>Contarino,</HI> they both &s;unk to the bottom; and the Captain of the <HI>Mary</HI> &s;eeing that he was altogether over|power'd, clo&s;ed with another <HI>Barbary</HI> Ship of great &s;trength; but firing his powder, they both blew up together: the noi&s;e and roaring of the Cannon in this engagement, had call'd in three other Ships to their a&s;|&s;i&s;tance; at who&s;e appearance, the Enemy made away with all the Sail they had, though they were &s;uperior both in number and &s;trength; yet they departed not with|out &s;ome evident marks of this &s;harp en|counter.</P>
<P>The Turks now for &s;everal days toge|ther play'd hard. upon the Fort <HI>Sabionera,</HI> with Cannon and Morter-pieces; and then made a vigorous a&s;&s;ault, but were beaten off: and at this time, <HI>Mon&s;ieur St. Andre Montburn</HI> made a &s;tout Sally upon them, in which about 2000 Turks were &s;lain. Now had the Turks receiv'd a con&s;iderable &s;uc|cour, which &s;pirited the Vi&s;ier, and made him re&s;olve to hold out the Siege. But 800 Jani&s;aries that were become both unable
<PB N="72" REF="39">and unwilling to continue any longer in that &s;ervice, mutinyed, and de&s;erted the Siege; &s;eeking for an opportunity to imbark them|&s;elves for their own Country. As the Cap|tain-General of the Chri&s;tians Fleet was riding about <HI>Suda</HI> with 15 Gallies, waiting the motion of the Turks Fleet, he receiv'd intelligence, that the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Canea</HI> had for the &s;upply of the Camp before <HI>Candia</HI> (not without the Grand Vi&s;iers order) &s;ent 200 &s;elect Turks out of that Garri&s;on, to convoy &s;ome Cattle, great and &s;mall, to their Army: Upon this information, the Captain-General landed a &s;trong party of his, commanded by an experienced Officer, who lay clo&s;e in ambu&s;h &s;omewhat beyond <HI>Picorna,</HI> where they were to pa&s;s; and as they came marching, he fell &s;uddenly in upon them, &s;cattered them, kill'd &s;ome up|on the place, and return'd to the Gallies with pri&s;oners, and the whole Booty; &s;o that the Cattle were, by the Generals or|der, pre&s;ently &s;ent into <HI>Candia</HI> for their &s;upply.</P>
<P>Much about this time, <HI>Mon&s;ieur de St. An|dre Montbrun</HI> ob&s;erving that the Turks be|gan to confide in, and rely very much upon a &s;mall Work they had rais'd near the <HI>La|zaretto,</HI> expecting thereby to annoy the <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="39">Ve&s;&s;els, as they pa&s;&s;ed to and fro in the Port; he with &s;ome hundreds in Boats fell upon the Turks by night, and forced them to quit the &s;ame, which was imme|diately demoli&s;hed, according to his or|der.</P>
<P>The Turks did murmur, and were very much di&s;contented at the proceedings of the Vi&s;ier, having lo&s;t before <HI>Candia</HI> above 80000 able Souldiers, and trifled away two years time without gaining any one con&s;i|derable Po&s;t: they generally affirming, that their Prophet could not be expected, in ju|&s;tice, to favour or a&s;&s;i&s;t them in a War, that with &s;o little cau&s;e, and &s;o great circum|vention and treachery, was at fir&s;t under|taken.</P>
<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Grand Vi&s;ier continued his Batteries again&s;t the Town for thirty &s;ix hours together, without the lea&s;t intermi&s;|&s;ion; in which a&s;&s;aults he lo&s;t 8000 of his men; wherein the Be&s;ieged receiv'd &s;ome lo&s;s al&s;o, and a few Officers. At <HI>Santa Vemerando,</HI> the Turks rais'd a new Fortifi|cation, which made the Chri&s;tians &s;ally out, and repul&s;e them with great damage, whereby they did alarm the whole Camp; in&s;omuch, that the Vi&s;ier him&s;elf came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<PB N="74" REF="40">
<P>In this month, <HI>Vincenzo Ro&s;piglio&s;i</HI> Gene|ral of the Popes Gallies arrived at <HI>Candia,</HI> to the great &s;atisfaction and joy of the Be|&s;ieged; who was &s;aluted at his arrival with all the Artillery, with Volleys of Small-&s;hot from the Souldiers, and then treated very honourably by the Proveditor General: <HI>Ro&s;piglio&s;i</HI> did di&s;tribute a very large &s;um of money among the Souldiers, as a Dona|tive, and gave &s;everal pre&s;ents to the Of|ficers. The Chri&s;tians receiv'd &s;upplies a|gain, which they &s;tood in need of; and the Turks play'd con&s;tantly upon the Port with their Batteries, and had lodged them&s;elves upon the Walls of <HI>Candia.</HI> The Turki&s;h Fleet riding near <HI>Canea,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted of 100 Gallies and upwards; with thirteen <HI>Bar|bary</HI> men of War, having found 3000 men at <HI>Gira Petra,</HI> and 6000 at <HI>Canea,</HI> to re|cruit the Vi&s;iers Army, which was very much impair'd by their frequent a&s;&s;aults, whereby the Be&s;ieged had receiv'd very con&s;iderable damages; for they lo&s;t &s;everal eminent Officers, particularly Colonel <HI>Portario</HI> a <HI>Siciliot,</HI> the Engineer <HI>Quadru|plano,</HI> Serjeant-Major-General <HI>Motto,</HI> Co|lonel <HI>Gamba,</HI> and the Marqui&s;s <HI>Carlotti.</HI> The Turks made &s;everal attempts upon the Fort <HI>Sabionera,</HI> in which they lo&s;t in few
<PB N="75" REF="40">days 6000 men and better; and after|wards turned the main Body of their Ar|my again&s;t the Fort St. <HI>Andre;</HI> and at the &s;ame time, to divert the Defendants, &s;torm|ed three or four other parts of the Town; but <HI>Mon&s;ieur St. Andre Montbrun</HI> was &s;o vi|gilant, that after a long and &s;harp conflict, the Turks were beaten off with great &s;laughter from all places.</P>
<P>The Venetians had landed 1000 able Foot about this time, expecting daily greater &s;uccours. Now the Turks divided their Army into two Bodies; and at the &s;ame time made two de&s;perate a&s;&s;aults upon the Forts of <HI>Sabionera</HI> and St. <HI>Andre,</HI> lying near the Sea; but herein they lo&s;t great numbers of their men, and the <HI>Aga</HI> of the Jani&s;aries was carried off by them with a mortal wound; but by an unfortunate &s;hot they kill'd Signior <HI>Andre Semitecolo</HI> and <HI>Grioni,</HI> belonging to the Be&s;ieged. Now there ar|riv'd at <HI>Candia,</HI> the Convoy commanded by <HI>Giacomo Cornaro</HI> with Men and Ammuni|tion, and 500 able Souldiers from <HI>Terra Firma,</HI> having in all put a &s;upply of above 3000 fre&s;h men into <HI>Candia.</HI></P>
<P>The Venetians being highly encouraged by the&s;e &s;upplies and recruits, made a &s;ally upon the Turks that were placed before
<PB N="76" REF="41">the Fort St. <HI>Andre,</HI> and counterfeiting a flight, drew them upon a Mine near the Fort <HI>Panigra,</HI> where they made a halt, and blew up the Mine, de&s;troying &s;ome hundreds of them.</P>
<P>The Turks having now lodged them|&s;elves in the Ditches of <HI>Sabionera,</HI> endea|voured by a Mine to blow up part of the Courtin; but the execution fell upon their own people, doing little or no damage to the Works.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the twelfth of <HI>Septehiber, S.N.</HI> a Ship arriv'd at <HI>Venice</HI> from the Ar|mata, bringing in it the body of the lately de|ceas'd General <HI>Bernardo Nani.</HI></P>
<P>The Be&s;ieged made a &s;ally upon the Be|&s;iegers that lay before <HI>Sabionera,</HI> beat them off of their Works, and carryed away with them &s;ix of their great Guns: upon which the Vi&s;ier drew off his Forces forty paces from their former Po&s;ts. In one of the Turks a&s;&s;aults, Colonel <HI>Pro&s;ilio,</HI> the Governour <HI>Tadeo Moro&s;ini,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Venturini,</HI> were all three kill'd with one Cannon-&s;hot; and the Be&s;ieged, in a &s;ally made upon the Ene|my, kill'd many of them, and retreated to the Town with &s;ome of their Baggage, but lo&s;t about fifty men, and a Nephew to the Marqui&s;s <HI>Villa,</HI> with three other per&s;ons of
<PB N="77" REF="41">quality. The Turks made another a&s;&s;ault, being hightned with the former &s;ucce&s;s; but were forced back with the lo&s;s of 1200 men, which were left dead upon the place. Much about the &s;ame time that the E|nemy attempted the Fort St. <HI>Andre,</HI> the Be&s;ieged &s;allied out upon them, and killed many upon the place, taking &s;ome Sacks of wool, which the Enemy us'd to defend them from their &s;hot, with &s;ome Swords and Arms, which they carryed into the Town. In the&s;e a&s;&s;aults, and the &s;ally at the <HI>Sabio|nera,</HI> the Chri&s;tians lo&s;t about &s;ixty men, among whom were the noble <HI>Marco Barba|rigo,</HI> Colonel <HI>Sala,</HI> one Engineer of <HI>Bur|gundy,</HI> and three Serjcants; among the wounded were the&s;e per&s;ons of note, <HI>Lo|renzo Dona, Franci&s;co Balti, Santo Barbaro,</HI> and &s;ome others, who&s;e names we could not learn; al&s;o the General <HI>Cattarin Cornaro</HI> was &s;lightly brui&s;ed with a &s;tone.</P>
<P>On the third, fourth, fifth and &s;ixth in|&s;tant, the Turks repeated their A&s;&s;aults up|on the Fort <HI>Sabionera,</HI> being moved there|unto by a large Breach they had made, of twenty Venetian paces in breadth; and though great numbers of them fell, they with great ob&s;tinacy pur&s;ued their de&s;igne, endeavouring to march over their dead, and
<PB N="78" REF="42">to advance their Standard on the breach; but they met with &s;uch &s;trong oppo&s;ition, that the Standard was broke in pieces, and they driven back with extraordinary, da|mage. In this action the prodigious valour of a Gally-&s;lave was very ob&s;ervable, who was found to have kill'd forty two of the E|nemy with his own hand in one day; which the Captain-General taking notice of, pub|lickly rewarded him, and made him at that in&s;tant Serjeant to a Company.</P>
<P>On the thirteenth in&s;tant, the new Ge|neral <HI>Battaja</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Candia</HI> with 2000 Souldiers, which he put into the Town, with a great &s;um of money and Am|munition.</P>
<P>About the latter end of his Month, the rains falling in &s;uch abundant &s;howers, de|&s;troyed many of their Mines and Pioneers, and did them much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>On the fourth of <HI>October,</HI> the General <HI>St. Andre Montbrun</HI> made a notable brisk &s;ally upon the Enemy, from the Fort of St. <HI>An|dre,</HI> beating the Turks out of their own Line, and po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of one of their Batteries, drawings off a Morter-piece, and intending to carry off their Cannon planted there; but the Turks coming &s;uddenly up|on them with their whole &s;trength, ob|&s;tructed
<PB N="79" REF="42">them in that enterprize, &s;o that it prov'd ineffectual; and they retreated into the Town: Signior <HI>Franci&s;co Battaglia,</HI> a Duke in <HI>Candia,</HI> and Brother to the Gene|ral of that name, as he was with his own hands drawing off one of the Turks Guns, was kill'd unluckily by a Musket-&s;hot; but his body was carryed off in &s;pight of all op|po&s;ition, by the valor of <HI>Carlo Dona,</HI> and <HI>Pietro Badoar;</HI> be&s;ides, eighty men were lo&s;t in this &s;ervice, and &s;everal wounded; a|mong the re&s;t, Signior <HI>Matteo Semitecolo</HI> was &s;hot in the Arm: &s;ince this, a Fugitive from the Enemies Camp inform'd the Be&s;ieged, that the Turks lo&s;t in this action about 1200 Souldiers; and among them the <HI>Aga</HI> of the Jani&s;aries, the Grand Vi&s;iers Lieute|nant, and two other eminent Commanders, and had 1500 wounded per&s;ons; which &s;o di&s;couraged the Be&s;iegers, that many of the Jani&s;aries de&s;erted the &s;ervice, and fled in|to the Mountains near adjoyning: and farther, that 300 Jani&s;aries be&s;ides had &s;eized upon &s;ome &s;mall Barks, and were put to Sea, being quite wearied with the length of the Siege, and the little &s;ucce&s;s of their enterprizes, re&s;olving to return home: and withal, that the Enemies Gallies had land|ed about 1000 Jani&s;aries, for the &s;uccour
<PB N="80" REF="43">and reinforcement of their Army; which upon the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t exact inquiry then made, notwith&s;tanding all their &s;up|plies and recruits, did con&s;i&s;t onely of twenty thou&s;and men; among whom were judged to be at lea&s;t &s;even thou&s;and Pio|neers.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>October,</HI> the Turks made three &s;everal a&s;&s;aults upon the Fort St.<HI>An|dre;</HI> and that &s;o furiou&s;ly and ob&s;tinately, that the Town was in very great danger of being utterly lo&s;t: but in the end, the Defendants forced them off with the &s;laughter of three hundred men, and &s;ome Officers.</P>
<P>The Be&s;ieged, about this time, were very much dejected, at the &s;udden departure of the <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Malta</HI> Squadron; by which means the Turks took an opportunity to re|inforce their Army with &s;ome thou&s;ands of men; but the Marqui&s;s <HI>St. Andre Montbrun,</HI> upon the appearance of the French Succours, with a party of re&s;olute Germans that were lately arriv'd at <HI>Candia,</HI> made a &s;tout Sal|ly, beat the Enemy from their Po&s;ts, and did great execution. In revenge of this af|front, the Turks the very next day made a general a&s;&s;ault with 30000 men at once, carrying Wool-&s;acks before them to keep
<PB N="81" REF="43">off the Small-&s;hot; which being perceiv'd by the Be&s;ieged, they immediately drew their great Guns to the Breaches, leden with Ca&s;e-&s;hot, and pointed upon them; which &s;o gall'd the Turks, that they were forced to retire: whereupon the Be&s;ieged made another A&s;&s;ault upon them with great &s;laughter; in&s;omuch, that the Enemy lo&s;t in the&s;e actions about 10000 men. <HI>Don Vincenzo Ro&s;piglio&s;i,</HI> General of the Popes Gallies, being a little before return'd from the &s;ervice of <HI>Candia,</HI> which highly incen&s;ed his Holine&s;s, excus'd it by laying the fault upon the Duke <HI>De Ferrandina;</HI> who being negligent, and not coming up with the <HI>Nea|politan</HI> and <HI>Sicilian</HI> Squadrons, which he Commanded, he was unwilling alone to expo&s;e the Popes Gallies to &s;uch imminent danger.</P>
<P>The Vi&s;ier at this time was very &s;evere, having taken off the head of one of his Ba&s;&s;a's, for making a fruitle&s;s a&s;&s;ault with|out order: the Turks fleeing daily from their Colours, and &s;cattering them&s;elves in &s;eve|ral parts of the I&s;land, though he had us'd all means imaginable to induce them to return; but his &s;everity in putting them to death when return'd, made the re&s;t betake them&s;elves to the Mountains for &s;ecurity.
<PB N="82" REF="44">The Grand Vi&s;ier de&s;pairing of &s;ucce&s;s, having receiv'd &s;o many and &s;o great lo&s;&s;es by the repeated Sallies of the Be&s;ieged, and being very much injur'd by the Autumn|rains, took up a re&s;olution to withdraw his Forces to <HI>New Candia;</HI> but the Grand Sig|nior being very much incen&s;ed at his ill &s;ucce&s;s, threatned him with the lo&s;s of his head, if he gave him not a better account of the Siege then hitherto he had done.

<P>In <HI>November,</HI> the Turks withdrew them|&s;elves from <HI>Sabionera;</HI> but &s;tood &s;till with great ob&s;tinacy before the Fort St. <HI>Andre,</HI> intending to advance upon the Shoar, and &s;hut up the entry into the Haven; but the French &s;uccours marching out in four divi|&s;ions, made a brisk Sally, being commanded by the Duke <HI>de Roannez</HI> (who was owned there by his ancient Title of <HI>de la Feuillade</HI>) with extraordinary &s;laughter of the Enemy.

<P>General <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> about this time di&s;patched Colonel <HI>Machierotti,</HI> a <HI>Candiot,</HI> with Letters to the Vi&s;ier, de&s;iring him to accept of an exchange for Signior <HI>La&s;caris</HI> General <HI>de Bataille,</HI> formerly taken Pri&s;oner; who went in a <HI>Felucca</HI> with a white Flag before <HI>Giofiro;</HI> but receiv'd this &s;hort an&s;wer from the Vi&s;ier, That he came thither to take the City , and not to treat about Pri&s;oners: whereupon Cavalier <HI>Grimani</HI> was imployed in the vacant charge.</P>
<P>The Turks continue the Siege with great eagerne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding their numerous and &s;ignal defeats, and the va&s;t inconveni|ences of the Winter-Sea&s;on; and pre&s;s ve|ry &s;hrewdly upon the <HI>Ba&s;tion</HI> of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> playing upon it with their Cannon; by one of which the <HI>Sieur du Prc,</HI> Major to the Brigade belonging to the Count <HI>de St. Paul,</HI> had his head taken off; and the <HI>Sieur de

<P>The Grand Vi&s;ier having intelligence that the French Forces were re-imbarqued, and homewards bound, made a furious a&s;|&s;ault, in the night, upon the Bulwarks of the <HI>Sabionera</HI> and St. <HI>Andre,</HI> at the &s;ame time, with 4000 men at each place, and ob&s;ti|nately di&s;puted with the Be&s;ieged for two hours &s;pace; but they were forced to retreat to their Po&s;ts, leaving the ground covered with their dead, and carrying off many that were wounded: the Chri&s;tians lo&s;ing not

<P>About the latter end of <HI>February,</HI> or be|ginning of <HI>March, Moro&s;ini</HI> the Captain-Ge|neral or Admiral of the Armata landed at <HI>Candia</HI> with 2000 able Souldies from <HI>Zante,</HI> 1700 Barrels of Powder, and a great quan|tity of Provi&s;ions arid Ammunition.</P>

Colo|nel <HI>Giovanni Batti&s;ta Zano</HI> endeavouring to take a Gallery from the Turks near <HI>Santo Spirito,</HI> was buried in one of their Mines; but the General &s;ent out a &s;trong party, who beat off the Turks, and recovered his Bo|dy out of the ruines of the Mines, and car|ried it into the Town: Signior <HI>Pietro Die|do</HI> by rea&s;on of his extraordinary indi&s;po&s;i|tion of Body, was upon his reque&s;t excu&s;ed from his Voyage into the <HI>Levant;</HI> and the Senate made choice of Cavalier <HI>Zozzi Cor|naro</HI> in his room.</P>
<P>In <HI>April</HI> 1669, the Turks made three de&s;perate a&s;&s;aults upon the Town, but were in all of them beaten off; and the Be&s;ieged by the &s;ucce&s;sful firing of one of their

<P>In this Month the Grand Signior &s;ent a Ba&s;&s;a to the Vi&s;ier, who in his name con|demned the Vi&s;ier for the little advantage he had made in the Siege, trifling away three years time, with an expence of &s;o much Trea|&s;ure, and the lo&s;s of &s;uch numbers of men, as might &s;uffice for the Conque&s;t of intire Kingdoms. The Vi&s;ier being very much di&s;atisfied with this me&s;&s;age, gave a furious a&s;&s;ault to the Bulwark of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> and <HI>Ravelin di Santo Spirito;</HI> but the Turks af|ter an hours hot di&s;pute drew off; and a|bout 5000 of them hoping to pa&s;s over one of the Mines of the Be&s;ieged of 150 Barrels of Powder, it was fired, and blew up 3000 of the Enemy, wounding and di&s;ordering them; and taking hold of this advantage, made a &s;ally upon the Be&s;iegers, and return|ed to the Town with 1000 Pri&s;oners, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday, May</HI> the twenty &s;ixth, <HI>S.N.</HI> the Holy Sacrament was in St. <HI>Marks</HI> Church in <HI>Venice,</HI> pablickly and &s;olemnly expos'd and on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> following, the Duke, Senate, and the greate&s;t part of the Nobility went in Proce&s;&s;ion; publick Prayers
<PB N="92" REF="48">being made in all Churches, to crave a ble&s;|&s;ing upon the &s;uccours and &s;upplies intended to be &s;ent to <HI>Candia</HI> by the Republique.</P>
<P>Now the Grand Vi&s;ier being very ap|prehen&s;ive of the Chri&s;tian &s;uccours from &s;e|veral parts, was re&s;olv'd to make a ge|neral a&s;&s;ault on the Forts of <HI>Sabionera,</HI> St. <HI>Andre,</HI> and <HI>Santo Spirito,</HI> ordering his Army (which notwith&s;tanding his recruits, con&s;i&s;t|ed but of 24000) into three Bodies, to be imployed again&s;t tho&s;e three places; and for the better expedition of his de&s;igne, did from &s;everal Batteries play for &s;everal days upon the Town, and principally upon the Jews quarter; upon which they had done &s;ome execution; but he altered his minde, as to the general a&s;&s;ault for the pre&s;ent, and call'd a Council of War, being re&s;olv'd, if po&s;&s;ible, to oblige the Town to a &s;urrender, before the arrival of the Chri&s;tian &s;upplies: and in order hereunto,</P>
<P>On the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> two hours before break of day, the Turks, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, fell upon the Bulwarks of <HI>Sa|bionera</HI> with great noi&s;e and fury, but af|ter a bloudy di&s;pute of three hours continu|ance, the Chri&s;tians &s;pringing &s;everal Mines, forced them to a rude and di&s;orderly retreat, leaving &s;everal &s;caling Ladders behind them;
<PB N="93" REF="48">and they lo&s;t in 'this &s;ervice three Ba&s;&s;a's , with &s;everal other eminent Officers, be&s;ides a great number of men.</P>
<P>And about this time, the Venetian Cap|tain-General of the Armata, having receiv'd intelligence, that there were eighteen men of War belonging to <HI>Barbary,</HI> enter'd into the Grand Signiors Service for that Sum|mer; and were &s;et out from &s;everal parts of <HI>Alexandria, Smyrna,</HI> and <HI>Soria,</HI> laden with Men, Ammunition and Provi&s;ions, bound for <HI>Canea,</HI> divided twenty four Men of War, under his Command, into three Squadrons, with orders to ingage the Ene|my, if di&s;covered. The Admiral him&s;elf &s;ailing to the Ea&s;tward of <HI>Candia</HI> with ten Ships, where he di&s;covered them, making all the Sail imaginable for <HI>Canea,</HI> whom he immediately fell upon, without any con&s;ide|ration of their number, and a &s;mart di&s;pute was entertain'd for &s;ome time; but the noi&s;e of the Guns brought in another Squa|dron of eight Venetian Ships to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that in a &s;hort time the Enemy was wor&s;t|ed, &s;ix Ve&s;&s;els &s;unk, and four taken, the re&s;t making away from him very much torn, and in great di&s;order: be&s;ides the number kill'd in that engagement, they took 800 Turks Pri&s;oners.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="49">
<P>The Be&s;iegers, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es, continued on Shore, pre&s;&s;ing the City on all parts, plying it with their Batteries and Granadoes, e&s;pecially on the &s;ide of the Fort St. <HI>Andre,</HI> where his Excel|lency Signior Cavalier <HI>Cattarin Cornaro,</HI> Pro|veditor extraordinary of the Armata, was kill'd unhappily by a Granado, which wounded him in the flanck, who receiv'd the Sacrament, and dyed an hour after.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday, June</HI> the &s;eventeenth, <HI>S. N.</HI> the Senate made Election of his Excellency Signior <HI>Alvi&s;e Mocenigo,</HI> to &s;ucceed in the place of the decea&s;ed Cavalier <HI>Cornaro,</HI> and conferred the Dignity of Knighthood upon his Brother Signior <HI>Girolamo Cornaro,</HI> in te&s;timony of the high e&s;teem they had to the party &s;lain, ordering a &s;olemn Funeral to be celebrated for him upon the publick account, and a &s;tately Tomb to be erected to his memory.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday, June</HI> the twenty &s;econd, there arriv'd at <HI>Venice</HI> a Ship from <HI>Can|dia,</HI> with the Body of the late decea&s;ed Proveditor extraordinary, Cavalier <HI>Cattarin Cornaro.</HI></P>
<P>The Venetians had now received &s;everal Recruits, under the Command of Signior <HI>Priuli,</HI> as well as the Turks; who with
<PB N="95" REF="49">&s;omuch a&s;&s;iduity continued their Batteries, Storms and Mines , that they made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the mo&s;t part of the Fort, &amp; planted there a Battery of ten pieces of Can|non, intending to play upon the Retrench|ment of the Chri&s;tians , with the which they di&s;mounted &s;everal of the Defendants Cannon, and did great execution in the Town. In the&s;e late actions, Signior <HI>Gia|como Contarini</HI> receiv'd a very dangerous wound in the Arm; Colonel <HI>Pini,</HI> an ex|perienc'd Officer was kill'd; and <HI>Mon&s;ieur de St. Andre</HI> had a &s;light hurt in the Arm, by the breaking of a Granado.</P>
<P>The French Succours put to Sea in <HI>June,</HI> and arriv'd at <HI>Candia</HI> in his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ties Fleet, commanded by the Duke <HI>de Beaufort;</HI> the Land-Forces being under the Command of the Duke <HI>de Navailles.</HI> And the Duke <HI>de Beaufort</HI> went in per&s;on to vi&s;it the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> who was receiv'd with the di&s;charge of all their Artillery, and with great acclamations; who taking a view of the Enemies po&s;ture, receiv'd a &s;light wound by a Hand-Granado.</P>
<P>About this time one <HI>Andrea Borazzi</HI> flee|ing to the Enemy, profer'd his &s;ervice to the Vi&s;ier, promi&s;ing to inform him which were the weake&s;t parts of the Town; who
<PB N="96" REF="50">was &s;ent accordingly with &s;ome Turki&s;h Officers; but he leading them to an Emi|nencie near the Walls, that they might the better &s;urvey the Town, the be&s;ieged fired a Mine under him, which blew up the Of|ficers, he onely e&s;caping: but the Grand Vi|&s;ier commanded him at his return to be put in Irons, &s;u&s;pecting his de&s;igne to be a meer piece of Treachery.</P>
<P>Still the Turks employed their whole &s;trength again&s;t the Bulwark St. <HI>Andre,</HI> and made a con&s;iderable Breach in the Re|trenchment; but the Chri&s;tians oppos'd them undauntedly, and repair'd by night what they beat down by day; and &s;prung a Mine of 150 Barrels of Powder under the Enemies Battery upon the ruines of the Ba&s;tion, which blew up a great number of the Turks, and four of their Guns: but the Be&s;ieged lo&s;t a per&s;on of great Re&s;olution and Conduct, the Noble <HI>Pietro Querini,</HI> by a Bomb, which breaking, gave another Of|ficer a mortal wound: the Captain-General (who flood between them, ob&s;erving the Enemies) remaining untoucht. The Sul|tan upon advice of the arrival of the French &s;upplies, propo&s;ed terms of peace, as he had formerly done oftentimes, onely to amu&s;e them, he being ab&s;olutely aver&s;e to any
<PB N="97" REF="50">&s;uch thing in reality, and to gain upon them the better by &s;uch fair propo&s;i|tions.</P>
<P>The Turks now had by their frequent a&s;|&s;aults and mines, made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the ruin'd Ba&s;tion of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> except a part of an Orillon , which was &s;till in di&s;|pute. But the General with a party of flout men made a &s;ally upon the Turks; who not being able to &s;tand in oppo&s;ition with them, quitted their Po&s;ts: This vacant time the Be&s;ieged &s;pent in ca&s;ting up a &s;mall Defence there, which kept the Enemy at a farther di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Now that the French Forces were arriv'd, and the Duke <HI>de Navailles</HI> had con&s;ulted with the Captain-General; the Turks were advanced, and had taken up their Po&s;ts up|on the Ba&s;tions of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> and <HI>la Sabio|nera:</HI> upon this Con&s;ultation with the French and Venetian Officers, it was thought very proper to attaque them upon the <HI>Sa|bionera;</HI> and the Duke <HI>de Navailles,</HI> the Ge|neral of the Forces, de&s;ir'd to have tho&s;e Souldiers out of the Garri&s;on, that could be well &s;par'd; which they conde&s;cended un|to: and farther, order was, given for five or &s;ix hundred Pioneers, to be imployed in throwing down the Works made by the E|nemy;
<PB N="98" REF="51">and a Sally to be made at the &s;ame time, to divert them from &s;ending relief to the other &s;ide. The Duke <HI>de Beaufort</HI> un|willing to be an unactive &s;pectator, offer'd them 1500 men out of the Fleet, and put him&s;elf in the head of the French Forces, being ready to receive Orders from the General, though very much urg'd to the contrary. And thus he entred upon a|ction.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the twenty fourth, fir&s;t 400 com|manded men marched out, and 50 others with Granadoes at the head of them; af|ter them three Troops of Hor&s;e, under the command of <HI>Mon&s;ieur Dampier;</HI> then the Regiments of <HI>Gaures, St. Valier, Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Bretagne</HI> followed, with four Troops of Hor&s;e upon the Wings, be&s;ides a party of the French Kings Mu&s;queteers, and 100 Re|formed Officers placed between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Line, to be ready upon any occa&s;ion. The Forces that came from the Fleet were at the &s;ame time to fall upon the left-&s;ide of the <HI>Sabionera;</HI> and <HI>Mon&s;ieur Mar&s;hal</HI> of the Camp appointed to a&s;&s;i&s;t them. In this Or|der they marched &s;ilently and undi&s;cover'd, and drew up in Battalia, in a little plain near the Enemies Camp: the commanded men coming within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot, were
<PB N="99" REF="51">fired at by the Turks; and then <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Dampier</HI> was commanded by the General to fall upon two Redoubts in the head of their Quarters, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;ome of the Guards; which was &s;o couragiou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully managed, that they took them immediately, and put every men to the Sword; and then their Lines were entred, and the Regiments of <HI>St. Valier</HI> and <HI>Lor|rain</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t them: the commanded men with the Companies of Guards, beat the Enemy out of their Trenches and Works. Thus far their de&s;ignes pro&s;pered, though they had but 300 of the 1500 expected from the Ships; nor were any Venetian Forces nor Pioneers &s;ent out to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as was promi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Turks having thus de&s;erted the Camp, drew up into a Body, upon a ri&s;ing, on their right-hand; which being ob&s;erv'd by the General, he in the head of his Forces marched towards them, and beat them twice from their Station; but he charged them &s;o home upon the third rally, that he gain'd the place whereon they fir&s;t drew up their men. Then hapned a cro&s;s accident that ruin'd that whole days de&s;ignes; for &s;ome Powder, Morter-pieces and Granadoes, taking fire by chance upon a Battery which
<PB N="100" REF="52">the Guards were po&s;&s;e&s;t with, they for&s;ook the place in di&s;order and confu&s;ion, though <HI>Mon&s;ieur Ca&s;tellan</HI> u&s;ed all art imaginable to bring them back; and the 300 men that came from the Navy, fell into the &s;ame di&s;|order, notwith&s;tanding all the endeavours of the Commanders to rally them. This made the Turks begin a fre&s;h charge; where|upon the Admiral, <HI>Mon&s;ieur Colbert,</HI> and the fifty Mu&s;queteers, joyned with the fir&s;t Bat|talion, and manfully oppo&s;ed them; but this accident had imprinted &s;uch a general terrour upon the Souldiers, that they were oblig'd to retreat; which was much fa|vour'd by a Courtin, made good by the Ge|neral. The Body of Re&s;erves was inve&s;ted by &s;everal Forces, which after a &s;light skir|mi&s;h at the Ba&s;tion of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> were &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t their fellow-Souldiers at the <HI>Sabio|nera;</HI> who al&s;o retreated di&s;orderly at la&s;t. The General gave &s;ignal te&s;timonies of his Courage and Conduct in this days di&s;a&s;ter; and made good his Retreat, pa&s;&s;ing through a party of the Enemy, with three or four Gentlemen onely that a&s;&s;i&s;ted him; but if all things had been performed as was in|tended, this day might, in all probability, have put an end to the Siege. The Vene|tians had in all 600 men which were kill'd
<PB N="101" REF="52">and di&s;abled. A Trooper e&s;caped from the pur&s;uit of the Enemy, found the Duke <HI>de Beaufort</HI> &s;o wounded, that he had not &s;trength to get up behind him; and he drew him a while by the Arm, thinking to bring him off; but being &s;o clo&s;ely followed by the Turks, that he was compel'd to flee, he left him to the Enemy, who kill'd him pre&s;ently upon the place.</P>
<P>Yet the next day, being the twenty fifth of <HI>June,</HI> about 200 of the French made a Sally out of the Ba&s;tion of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> which gave &s;uch an Alarm to the Turks, that they came to make good their Po&s;ts; but the Be&s;ieged firing three Mines, blew up many of the Be&s;iegers, with &s;ome Com|manders of Quality; and de&s;troyed a very con&s;iderable Battery.</P>
<P>On <HI>July</HI> the fifth, <HI>S. N.</HI> the Count <HI>de Vivonne</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Candia</HI> with the French Gallies, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the charge of Admiral, finding the Fleet de&s;titute of one. The &s;ame day al&s;o arriv'd the Squa|dron of <HI>Malta</HI> Gallies with eight hundred Souldiers.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth, the Duke <HI>de Navailles,</HI> being over-heated in the late engagement, fell in|to a violent Fever.</P>
<P>On the twelfth of <HI>July,</HI> arriv'd a Convoy
<PB N="102" REF="53">at <HI>Candia</HI> with 1600 Souldiers, Ammuniti|on and Monies.</P>
<P>The Baron <HI>de St. Marre,</HI> Captain of the Guards to the Duke <HI>de Beaufort,</HI> hearing as yet no news of his Ma&s;ter by Spies, or any other means what&s;oever, went in per&s;on to the Vi&s;ier's Camp; where being admitted by him into the Tent, he gave him a view of all the Heads that were cut off in the late fight; but he could not finde the Admirals among them; at which the Vi&s;ier was very much di&s;&s;atisfied, and afterwards gave him liberty to di&s;cour&s;e with &s;everal Pri&s;oners in the Camp, but he could learn no news of him that was &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>On the twenty fourth in&s;tant, all the <HI>French, Malta</HI> and <HI>Pope</HI>'s Squadrons were ordered to lye before the Turks Po&s;t at St. <HI>Andre,</HI> where they fir'd upon the Enemies Camp, and did them great damage: but when the Generals had drawn out their Forces, and were ready to fall upon the Be&s;iegers, the <HI>Tere&s;e,</HI> which was the French Vice Admiral, blew up by &s;ome unfortunate accident, or a &s;hot from the Enemy, with 400 men aboard, to the damage of &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els, the Admiral particularly, that lay next her, and the Captains Gally that took fire al&s;o, but was quenched; which made
<PB N="103" REF="53">the whole Fleet put out to Sea, and hin|dred the Generals de&s;igne of making a Sal|ly: but the Turks receiv'd great hurt by the firing of the Fleet; and lo&s;t an <HI>Aga,</HI> the Vi&s;iers great favourite.</P>
<P>On the thirtieth in&s;tant, a Sally was made by <HI>Mon&s;ieur Colbert</HI> at the <HI>Sabionera,</HI> with &s;ome execution upon the Enemy; but <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Colbert</HI> was &s;lightly hurt in the head with a &s;tone which fell from the Gate, bro|ken by a Morter-piece.</P>
<P>The General <HI>Girolamo Battaja</HI> was mor|tally wounded, in three places, by a Morter-piece breaking near him, which was di&s;|charg'd from the Enemies Batteries, he be|ing then bu&s;ied about the <HI>Sabionera,</HI> and giving Orders to his Officers again&s;t &s;ome fre&s;h approach intended by the Be&s;iegers. The Turks continue &s;till imploying their greate&s;t force again&s;t St. <HI>Andre,</HI> having rai&s;ed a Battery, and planted eight Guns there|on, firing upon the Retrenchments made by the Be&s;ieged, to &s;upply the ruines of that Fort; but were valiantly oppos'd and re|puls'd: however, the Enemy took an ad|vantagious Po&s;t near the <HI>Scozze&s;e;</HI> which made Signior <HI>Navaglier,</HI> a Noble Venetian, &s;ally out with a party of Souldiers, intend|ing to di&s;lodge them; but he received a
<PB N="104" REF="54">dangerous Mu&s;quet-&s;hot in the neck. The Turks &s;till plyed the Town with &s;howers of Stones, Morter-pieces and Granadoes; and Count <HI>Waldeck</HI> General of the <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> Forces, was kill'd with one of them. The Be&s;iegers then endeavouring to bend their &s;trength towards the <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> on the &s;ide of the <HI>Sabionera,</HI> met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition, that they gave over that attempt, and con|verted their Forces to the other &s;ide of the Town, where they made them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of the fir&s;t Retrenchment, not without great lo&s;s; and did attaque the &s;econd; but the Be&s;ieged had ca&s;t up two o|ther Works behind them, with large Trenches.</P>
<P>In <HI>Angu&s;t,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Mirandola</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Candia,</HI> and landed his Ammunition with 1400 of his own men, and 600 others, and Monies for the Souldiers.</P>
<P>The Turks had now ca&s;t up a great Mount upon the ruines of the Ba&s;tion of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> and planted &s;everal Cannon up|on it, with which they greatly annoyed the Town; but to fru&s;trate this de&s;igne, the General cau&s;ed the Church of St. <HI>Frances</HI> to be fill'd with Earth, and drew twenty great Guns upon it, which played hotly upon the Enemy, di&s;mounted their Cannon,
<PB N="105" REF="54">and made the place altogether u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>The Turks &s;till laboured hard to take in the &s;econd Retrenchment; but the Defen|dants fir'd a Mine made under that Bulwark, which being divided into &s;everal Branches, kill'd many of the Enemies, de&s;troyed part of their Works, who&s;e ruines divided 400 Turks from the re&s;t of the Body, &s;o that they could not po&s;&s;ibly e&s;cape, but were all taken pri&s;oners, and carryed into the Town: and the Be&s;ieged made another &s;ucce&s;sful Sally, upon the firing of another Mine, with an incredible &s;laughter to the Turks, and brought off with them a con&s;iderable num|ber of the Pri&s;oners. Then the Turks on the other &s;ide of the Town, endeavour'd to &s;hut up a Sally-port near the <HI>Sabionera,</HI> that &s;o they might make a farther progre&s;s to|wards the Sea, and by degrees attempt the <HI>Ar&s;enal;</HI> but by a Sally in favour of &s;eve|ral Mines, they left off that enterpri&s;e with lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Now the Auxiliary Forces &s;ent from <HI>France</HI> were imbarqued, being in all 88 Sail, in order to their return. Upon who&s;e de|parture, the Turks took courage, and im|mediately fell upon the <HI>Sabionera,</HI> and St. <HI>Andre,</HI> with two great parties, thinking the Be&s;ieged were di&s;pirited, and quite di&s;ani|mated,
<PB N="106" REF="55">the French Fleet being gone; but they found the contrary to their detriment, lo&s;ing 3000 men, after three fierce a&s;&s;aults; and the Defendants but 200, with &s;everal that were wounded; who by firing of a Mine of thirty Barrels of powder under the Bulwark, where the Enemy had rai&s;ed a Battery which much infe&s;ted the &s;econd Retrenchment, that was wholly de&s;troyed, and the Turks in great numbers either blown up, or buryed in the rubbi&s;h of the Battery.</P>
<P>The Generali&s;&s;imo at length, finding af|ter all their Sallies, A&s;&s;aults, Mines and Skir|mi&s;hes, that <HI>Candia</HI> was reduced to a meer heap of Rubbi&s;h, being &s;o far entred by the Turks, and the Garri&s;on &s;o le&s;&s;ened, that there remain'd in it no more then 3600 men fit for Service, &s;o that it was thought ab|&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve it any longer from the Enemy, call'd a Council, where it was re&s;olv'd <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI> that they &s;hould u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours in order to a Treaty with the Vi&s;ier about a Surren|der; and accordingly Colonel <HI>Arnardi,</HI> and Signior <HI>Scordeli</HI> the Vice-Chancellor, were employ'd to manage the Treaty; and on the fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> were &s;ent out to the Po&s;t on the &s;ide of <HI>Giofiro</HI> with a white
<PB N="107" REF="55">Flag, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was communicated to the Grand Vi&s;ier: The news was immedi|ately &s;pread throughout the whole Turki&s;h Camp, and entertain'd with exce&s;s of joy, and Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to treat on the Turks behalf; between whom that whole day was &s;pent, with no other i&s;&s;ue, but that the next conference &s;hould be in the open Field, before the Fort <HI>Demetrius,</HI> where the Turks &s;et up a large Tent for that purpo&s;e; where the Treaty was con|tinued till the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> and then the Articles were concluded upon by both parties; for performance whereof they gave Ho&s;tages on both &s;ides, particularly Signior <HI>Calbo</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary for Provi&s;ions, <HI>De Riva</HI> Lieutenant of the General Guards, and <HI>Zaccaria Mocenigo,</HI> from the Venetians; and the <HI>Beglerbey</HI> of <HI>Temi&s;war, Mahomet Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Jani&s;aries,</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;&s;i Bey,</HI> the <HI>Tefferdat</HI> of <HI>Romilia,</HI> from the Turks.</P>
<P>The Turks Ho&s;tages were &s;ent into <HI>Can|dia</HI> and the Venetians into the Turki&s;h Camp, where they had an extraordinary civil reception, there being a rich Apartment pre|par'd for them, a Guard of Jani&s;aries or|dered to attend them whither they pleas'd, and a Table of thirty Di&s;hes of meat al|lowed</P>

<P>On <HI>Friday,</HI> the twentieth of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> the Garri&s;on marched out without the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; the Vi&s;ier being re|&s;olv'd

<P><HI>September</HI> the thirteenth, a &s;tately Hear&s;e was expos'd to publick view in St. <HI>Marks</HI> Church, and the Church it &s;elf hung with Black, and fill'd with many Lights, in cele|bration of the Funeral of his Excellency Signior Cavalier <HI>Cornaro,</HI> where a &s;olemn Ma&s;s, and variety of excellent Mu&s;ick, was perform'd by &s;everal Quires; and in the clo&s;e, Father <HI>Co&s;mi</HI> pronounced a Funeral-Oration, wherein was an account of all the eminent Services of that Illu&s;trious Com|mander.</P>

<P>On <HI>Friday, September</HI> the twenty &s;eventh, the Forces were drawn out of the City of <HI>Candia;</HI> and the &s;ame day, according to the Articles of Agreement, the Keys were &s;ent to the Vi&s;ier, who receiv'd them with many &s;ignes of joy, and rewarded the

The Grand Vi&s;ier's civility was eminently mani|fe&s;ted to all the Venetians Officers of any note; but more remarkable to the Genera|li&s;&s;imo <HI>Moro&s;ini,</HI> to whom he gave &s;everal pre&s;ents, with this Complement, <HI>That the Peace &s;hould be as long-liv'd as his Command;</HI> to whom the General return'd &s;everal pre|&s;ents likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>On the fourth of <HI>October,</HI> the Grand Vi|&s;ier made his &s;olemn entry into the City of <HI>Candia,</HI> at the Breach of St. <HI>Andre,</HI> with all his Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of about 15000 Souldiers, &amp; between ten &amp; eleven thou&s;and Pioneers; be&s;ides other nece&s;&s;ary Attendants. At his entrance, he found the City empty, without People, Goods or Provi&s;ions; there being onely left behind two Greeks, three Jews, and eight more &s;trangers, whom the Vi&s;ier would al&s;o have &s;ent away; but they were of opinion, it was more convenient to change their Religion then City , and &s;o turn'd Turk.</P>

<P>Since the Grand Vi&s;ier's entring into the City, he hath converted the four principal Churches thereof into Mo&s;ques, for the wor&s;hip of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> and the other are turn'd into Stables, for his own, and the Hor&s;es of his Souldiers.</P>
<P>In this Month the Articles of Peace were ratified by the Grand Signior at <HI>Lari&s;&s;a;</HI> and on <HI>Monday, October</HI> the twenty one, <HI>S.N</HI> 1669, the French Amba&s;&s;ador made his ad|dre&s;s to the Venetian College, with Com|plements of Condolency for the Surrender of <HI>Candia,</HI> and of Congratulation for the Honourable Articles of Peace concluded between the mo&s;t Serene Republique and the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port; which were, the &s;ame E|vening they came to their hands, being the eighteenth in&s;tant, ratified and confirm'd by the Votes of the whole Senate, three onely excepted; and the Ratification immediately di&s;patched to their Captain-General.</P>
<P>Since this, Signior Cavalier <HI>Molino</HI> was cho&s;en Amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary to the Grand Signior, with an ample and firm Ra|tification or the &s;aid Peace, together with a noble and rich Pre&s;ent of Cloth of Gold to him&s;elf, and &s;everal con&s;iderable &s;ums of Monies, as Pre&s;ents to his Officers and Mini|&s;ters.</P>

<P>Now the Generali&s;&s;imo <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> left the charge of the whole Army, with the Conduct of the Fleet which is to tran&s;port the Venetians, with all things nece&s;&s;ary, to the care and management of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de St. Montbrun,</HI> who made &s;ome &s;tay at <HI>Standia,</HI> he him&s;elf being gone to <HI>Suda,</HI> with &s;eve|ral per&s;ons of Quality, the Natives, a Squa|dron of Ships, and a con&s;iderable quantity of Provi&s;ions, and number of Men, to re|inforce that, and the re&s;t of the Garri&s;ons that continue &s;till under the Juri&s;diction of the Republique; and to furni&s;h them with all things convenient and nece&s;&s;ary for their defence, upon all occa&s;ions that &s;hould hap|pen.</P>
