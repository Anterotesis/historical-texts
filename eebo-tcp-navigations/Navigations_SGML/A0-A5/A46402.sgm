Highne&s;&s;es, that the &s;ayd Memorial be again &s;om what afre&s;h reiterated, the fore&s;aid Regents of the Ea&s;t-Indie Netherlands Com|panie wil with permi&s;&s;ion of your Pui&s;.

Highne&s;&s;es, and con&s;equentlie of the procee|dings held in England by Committies on both &s;ides, and what further was acted in the &s;ame, and &s;o com to the Principal Matter, to de|mon&s;trate as briefly as po&s;&s;iblie may be, how unrea&s;onable and wholie ungrounded tho&s;e complaints are, which in the beginning were &s;o clamorous, and then will fullie ju&s;tifie the Goverment of Batavia in their management and proceedings in tho&s;e affaires.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="3">
<P>What Concerns the fir&s;t, Mr. Chudlie ex|traordinary Envoy by his Memorial of the 25. May, of the fore-&s;aid year 1683, complained to your Pui&s;. Highne&s;&s;es, that the Govern|ment of Batavia had in a manner altogether ex|traordinarie, outragiou&s;lie delt with the En|gli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indie Companie, and by main force driven them out of their ancient place of re&s;i|dence at Bantham, and that in &s;o &s;trange a manner, that not any one Example (a thing rather to be buried in &s;ilence, then related) of the like nature can be produced, and there|fore requiring that the &s;aid Netherlandi&s;h Companie &s;hould be obliged to draw back their Troupes out of Bantam, ree&s;tabli&s;h the En|gli&s;h there again, and to make reparation of the lo&s;&s;es by them &s;u&s;tayned. But Sr. John Chardin, before mentioned, who by the fore|&s;aid Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indie Companie was &s;ent hither in Commi&s;&s;ion, did &s;omwhat mitigate the&s;e complaints, apparently, becau&s;e they were &s;o horriblie extravagant, and in &s;tead of accu&s;ing the Government of Batavia, as if they had driven the Engli&s;h out of Bantam, did content him&s;elf to &s;ay, that it happened through the &s;ugge&s;tion and Coun&s;el of Major St. Mar|tin, who commanded the Netherlandi&s;h Troups at Bantam in Chef, and that it was he that di&s;po&s;ed the King to put forth the Engli&s;h out of Bantam, and although all he affirmed was without any proof, but only grounded on a Conjecture, yet that which is to be wondred
<PB N="8" REF="4">at is, that he would form a publick Memorial on &s;o &s;light and weak grounds.</P>
<P>And although the Bewinthebbers were at that time unfurni&s;hed with &s;uch Elucidation of matters as is requi&s;ite, not yet having then any of their Ships returned out of India, and what they knew in the bu&s;ine&s;s, was by Letters only &s;ent in Engli&s;h Ships from England, where the &s;aid Letters were held up &s;ome time, the &s;eals broken and opened, and then afterward handed to the Corre&s;pondent of the Netherlan|di&s;h Company at London, notwith&s;tanding they omitted not according to the knowledge they had attained, to give your Highne&s;&s;es In|formations and An&s;wers to their Complaints. Whereupon your Pu. Highne&s;&s;es having gi|ven an An&s;wer to the &s;aid Chudlie and Char|din (unto which the Engli&s;h Company in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of their Writing do appeal) &s;oon af|ter with the good liking of your Pu. High|ne&s;&s;es, a treatie began with the forenamed Chardin and the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, and the bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;o far avanced, that on both &s;ides a final agreement was a&s;&s;uredly ex|pected, whereas on a &s;uddaine Mr. Chudlie and Sr. John Chardin pretending to have command and order from their King to put a &s;top to the bu&s;ine&s;s, the fore&s;aid Treati&s;e here was unexpectedly broken of, however was with con&s;ent of your Pu. Highne&s;&s;es, who de&s;ired nothing more then to compo&s;e and conclude, if po&s;&s;ible, this matter in a friend|ly
<PB N="9" REF="4">way, continued in England, whereunto the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador Citters was furni&s;hed with full Order and Power both from your Pu. Highne&s;&s;es, as al&s;o from the Companie here: but hereupon the Engli&s;h Hightning their Demands, and as appeared afterward, even in their reply, of which &s;hall be &s;poken hereafter, they avoued to have other de&s;ignes, intending to ree&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves at Bantam, unto which end in the latter part of the year 1683. they prepared a great Fleet well manned to effect the &s;ame; but this their de&s;ign, as them&s;elves affirm, &amp; complain that they might not put it in execution, as being hindred by the now decea&s;ed King, of happy Memorie, hereupon this Treati&s;e was &s;topt, and no fur|ther progre&s;s made therein until at length, it plea&s;ed his &s;aid Maje&s;ty to make way for the pro&s;ecuting of the agreement pre&s;cribed Anno 1674. between his Maje&s;ty and this State, to wit, that the differences &s;hould be determined and compo&s;ed by Committies on both &s;ides, who to that end according to the fore&s;aid Convention were to a&s;&s;emble together at London, the which being al&s;o approved by your Pu. Highne&s;&s;es, there was erected a Tribunal Court, con&s;i&s;tng of eight Committies, four on each part, before whom, after that the Parties on both &s;ides had di|vers times appeared about the Praeliminaries and ca&s;es incident, it was thought meet, that all things &s;hould be handled in writing, and
<PB N="10" REF="5">the State of the ca&s;e &s;o written, to be made by Demand, An&s;wer, Reply, and Duplick (or double Reply) even to a Triplick and Quadruplick, and be&s;ides all this there were delivered up &s;uch pieces probatory as might &s;erve to fortifie and maintain the ca&s;e on the one hand, with the Confutation of the &s;ame on the other hand, they of the Netherlandi&s;h Company al&s;o making their Demand again&s;t the Demand of the Engli&s;h, and delivering the &s;ame over by way of reconvention or contrary Demand, for the fraiting of four Ships, where|with the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, upon the earne&s;t Reque&s;t of the Engli&s;h Companie had accommodated them, amounting to thirteen thou&s;and nine hundred pound Starling. In &s;o much that the fore&s;aid Peeces being delivered to the &s;aid Committies to do right therein, the Engl&s;h Commi&s;&s;aries in their vote declared, that it was their opinion and &s;entence, that in &s;tead of all what was demanded by the En|gli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indie Companie (to wit, not only the recalling of the Netherlandi&s;h Troops out of Bantam, and the Territories thereof, but moreover and above to deliver up the Ca&s;tle and City of Bantam.) The Netherlan|di&s;h Companie was only bound, to ree&s;tabli&s;h the &s;aid Engli&s;h Company in Bantam, &s;o, and in &s;uch wi&s;e as was demanded by Mon&s;ieur Chardin in the Hague, and to &s;ettle all things in &s;tate as it was before the Warr, and the Damages and Reconvention (or contrary De|mands)
<PB N="11" REF="5">&s;hould be re&s;erved.</P>
<P>But the Committies of this State delivering in their Advice, every one of them in order did under&s;tand and declare, that forasmuch as the deci&s;ion of the ca&s;e, which mu&s;t be judicially determined, did depend upon the veritie of Fact, which the Engli&s;h Companie had charged the Netherlandi&s;h Companie with, and in &s;pecial that the &s;aid Engli&s;h Companie were by them driven out of Bantam, of which they could not produce the lea&s;t proof, that there|fore the &s;aid Engli&s;h Companie ought to have their Demand and Conclu&s;ion made, and ta|ken up again&s;t the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, denyed them: and the &s;aid Engli&s;h Companie to be condemned to &s;atisfie the Netherlandi&s;h Companie for the Fraighting of the four Ships which they demand by reconvention: by which, becau&s;e of the ce&s;&s;ation of voices, the ca&s;e being fallen into the terms, which they were in according to the convention of a|greement of the year 1673/4, mu&s;t come into the hands of an Arbitrator or Compromi&s;&s;a|rius, to the cho&s;ing of whom by the fore&s;aid agreement the time of a Month was pre&s;cribed: but the &s;aid Committies for the Deci&s;ion on both &s;ides, not agreeing, for although the Engli&s;h Companie were plantif in convention, yet the Engli&s;h Commi&s;&s;aries did not propo&s;e a Super Arbitrator, &s;o hereby the whole ca&s;e, according to an Act pa&s;&s;ed and &s;ub&s;cribed on both &s;ides, was left in the hands of his &s;aid
<PB N="12" REF="6">Maje&s;tie and your Highne&s;&s;es, to be deter|mined by you, according to the contents of the fore&s;aid Agreemtnt And this is the rea&s;on why the &s;aid Mr. Skelton, Envoy Extraordi|nary, made the fore&s;aid Memorial and Addre&s;s to vour Pu. Highne&s;&s;es to doe ju&s;tice in the ca&s;e to the Subjects of England: Whereupon it mu&s;t needs fall under Examination, whither the complaints which the Engli&s;h Company have, and &s;till doe make of the bu&s;ine&s;s hap|pened at Bantam, be grounded on &s;uch &s;olid Rea&s;ons, as to oblige the Netherlandi&s;h Com|panie &s;o to re&s;ettle them at Bantam, as they were before the War, (for more then this was before denyed to be due to them, by the En|gli&s;h Commi&s;&s;aries them&s;elves) and that with reparation of Dammages and Intere&s;ts, which they pretend to have &s;u&s;tained by the Nether|lands Company. Now to make this ca&s;e to appear more clearly, forasmuch, as &s;ince it was fir&s;t pre&s;ented to your Pu. Highne&s;&s;es by Mr. Chudly Extraordinary Envoy, and after|ward more amply pre&s;&s;ed by Sr. John Char|din, is now wholy altered, and quite of an|other face: as al&s;o that the Netherlandi&s;h Com|pany hath recovred further proofs for the Con|futation of what the Engli&s;h Company did bring in, and maintain, therefore it will be nece&s;&s;ary to dive &s;omewhat deeper into the matter.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;e is this, Sulthan Agon, formerly King of Bantam, and Father of the pre&s;ent King now reigning, having re&s;olutions, both
<PB N="13" REF="6">in re&s;pect of his age, and other con&s;iderations to di&s;inve&s;t him&s;elf of the Government, and lead a &s;till and private life, he made over his Kingdom to his Elde&s;t Son, retiring him&s;elf to Turtia&s;&s;a, a place of plea&s;ure, about &s;ix miles from Bantam, and &s;eated a mile from the Sea, there to &s;pend the re&s;idue of his dayes free from publick affaires. His Son &s;eated on the Throne, and having the Government of the Kingdom in his hands, forthwith &s;ent Amba&s;&s;a|dors to Batavia (accompanied for the further Splendor with a train of about 300. per&s;ons) to give notice to the Government there of his acce&s;s to the Crown, and al&s;o to reniew their ancient Alliance, &s;ending al&s;o Amba&s;&s;adors to England, where they were in &s;uch manner re|ceived, as that tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t-Indie Com|pagnie by their Letter to the &s;aid King of Ban|tam in July 1682. written about two years after the yong King was come unto the Crown, &s;ay, that &s;uch honor was given to his Am|ba&s;&s;adors, as if they been &s;ent from the grea|te&s;t King or Potentat of the World, adding in the &s;aid Letter, that they did with joy un|der&s;tand, that God Almighty had brought and inve&s;ted him on the Throne of his Kingdom of Souro&s;oan, that is, the Kingdom of Ban|tam, with the good wil of his Father.</P>
<P>And furthermore his Maje&s;ty of Great Brit|tain &s;ent away the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors with pre|&s;ents to the young King their Ma&s;ter, accom|panied with an honourable Letter to him, all
<PB N="14" REF="7">which in the Proce&s;s is produced, and in which he is &s;tiled the famous and Illu&s;trious Sulthan Abdul Cahar Aba Na&s;ar King and Lord of the &s;aid Kingdom of Souro&s;oan, that is of Ban|tam, adding moreover, that his Maje&s;ty re|ceived the fore&s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors with all due re&s;pect, according to their Character, and with entire affection, as coming from a Prince, who&s;e Per&s;on and Amitie his Maje&s;ty declared to have in very high e&s;teem, and unto whom, he judged it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end over his Agent or Envoy, furni&s;hed with power from his Maje|&s;ty, and order from the Engli&s;h Company, for to make a &s;trickter League with the King of Bantam, which te&s;timony and proffer of Alliance was yet further reiterated in another Letter, writ by the fore&s;aid Engli&s;h Company from London the 17. July 1682. al&s;o produ|ced in the Proce&s;s. By all which then it ap|peareth undeniably unto all that are impartial; that the pre&s;ent King now ruling was acknow|ledged both by the King of Great Brittain, and by the Engli&s;h Company, as well in En|gland as in India, for the lawful Lord and King of the whole Kingdom of Bantam, and as the Succe&s;&s;or of his Father.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as the pre&s;ent King in the direction of the affaires of the Kingdom, did not, as it &s;eems, an&s;wer the expectation of his Father, nor &s;atisfy the humor of manie of his Subjects, there aro&s;e a heavie Civil War in the Kingdom, in which the malcontented
<PB N="15" REF="7">entending to ca&s;t of the yoke from their neck as they termed it, after they had al&s;o drawn the Old King to their partie, who thereupon &s;trengthened him&s;elf in Turtia&s;&s;a (as al&s;o the King now reigning did at Bantam) at length by force of armes they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ter of Bantham, and be&s;ieged the yong King in his Ca&s;tle into which he was retired, enten|ding to bereave him both of his Throne and life, and to &s;et up a yonger Brother in his place: whereupon this King apprehending no other way of deliverance, as having mo&s;t of the great ones of his Kingdom animated again&s;t him, and the Communaltie al&s;o his ene|mies, thought it expedient for him to make known to the General of the Councel of the Netherlandi&s;h Companie at Batavia, his mi&s;erable State, and that he not onely was to ex&s;pect the los of the Crown, but al&s;o a mo&s;t cruel death: the which he &s;ignifyed, in mo&s;t la|mentable wi&s;e, imploring their a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but they not judging it convenient in a ca&s;e of &s;uch importance to intrude them&s;elves to unadvi&s;ed|ly, did, before they determined any thing in the lea&s;t about it, conclude to interpo&s;e their Mediation betwixt Father and Son, and to that end to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors with letters tending to that purpo&s;e: But the Father in a mo&s;t di&s;daing|ful manner rejecting the &s;ame, without vouch|&s;afing to return any an&s;wer at all to the Govern|ment of Batavia or their Committies, the &s;aid Government did at la&s;t re&s;olue, &s;eeing the con|dition
<PB N="16" REF="8">of the Son tending to ruin, as beeing for&s;aken almo&s;t by all, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the Rebels, and if po&s;&s;ible to deliver him out of the mi&s;erable e&s;tate into which he was brought, which al&s;o they did with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;&s;e, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong oppo&s;ition of the Enemie, we Landed our forces, ray&s;ed the &s;iege of the Ca&s;tle in which the King was, and &s;et him again upon his Throne, who there|uppon both to demon&s;trate how gratly he was offended with the Engli&s;h, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted his enemies, as al&s;o to provide for his own &s;e|curitie for the future, did without any in&s;tiga|tion of the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, command them to leave his countrie and to depart el&s;e|where with their Goods. This then beeing a true Narration of what pa&s;&s;ed in the&s;e affaires, the&s;e con&s;iderable things do pre&s;ent them&s;el|ves to con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the Old King having made over his Kingdom to his elde&s;t Son, he therely be|came lawful King by his Fathers tran&s;port, and was acknowleged &s;o to be, by the King of Great Brittain, and by them of the Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indie Companie.</P>
<P>Secondly, that he therely being lawful King, his &s;ubjects in taking up arms agayn&s;t him, were Rebels.</P>
<P>Thirdlie, that according to the Law of na|ture and af nations, it is not onely permitted, to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant unto a King, that is oppre&s;&s;ed by his &s;ubjects, but that &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance is ap|prouvable
<PB N="17" REF="8">and a Work of Charity and Love.</P>
<P>Fourthly, that it is contrary to the Rule of Ju&s;tice, to a&s;cribe the evil Con&s;equences of a lawful and worthie Act, unto him that is the Author of the &s;aid Act, and not of the con|&s;equences.</P>
<P>Fifthly, that it is altogether again&s;t rea&s;on to impute the Cha&s;ing of the English out of Bantam unto them of the Government of Ba|tavia, and to their auxiliarie Forces, becau&s;e it is manife&s;t, that the departure of the Engli&s;h out of Bantam was not a nece&s;&s;ary, but an ac|cidental Con&s;equence, the King not cau&s;ing them to depart becau&s;e he was victorious (for he had &s;uffered them to live there from the time he came to the Crown until the Warr, to wit, during the two years of his Reign) but only becau&s;e he was certain they had a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Re|bels, be&s;ides many other &s;u&s;pitions he might ju&s;tly have taken up again&s;t them.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this, they of the Engli&s;h Com|pany doe alledge, and depo&s;e for a real truth, that they of Batavia had rai&s;ed and fomented the quarrels between the Old and the Young King of Bantam.</P>
<P>That two yeares before the Warr began they had had &s;ecret Negotiations with Pangeran Diepa Panerat, one of the Principal Mini&s;ters of the young King, to bring about this their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>That they afterward having got this King in|to their &s;nares, and mo&s;t perfidou&s;ly brought
<PB N="18" REF="9">him under their yoke, forthwith forced him to drive out the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>And to make the Mini&s;ters of the Nether|landish Company yet the more &s;u&s;pected and &s;tincking to all the world, they undertook in the beginning of the year 1683. to repre&s;ent unto the King of Great Brittain that the fore|&s;aid Major St. Martin who commanded over the forces of the Netherlandi&s;h Company at Bantam in Chef had committed very many Enormities again&s;t the Factors, People and the Effects of the Engli&s;h Company at Ban|tam, &s;o farr that they di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and drave them out of their place of re&s;idence: But in &s;tead that the English Company ought to have proved the Facts which are e&s;&s;ential to the thing, in ca&s;e they herein aimed to triumph, they doe not in the whole product which they made in the Proce&s;s thereof, &s;o much as alledge the lea&s;t appearance either directly or indirectly, no not &s;o much as con&s;equentially might &s;erve for the verifying of the Enormities of &s;uch Facts.</P>
<P>And although the Netherlandi&s;h Compa|ny might &s;tand upon the Negative, which is not nece&s;&s;ary, nay many times po&s;&s;ible to be proved, &s;ave only indirectly (for no man can in a direct manner prove that which is not) ne|verthele&s;s to manife&s;t clearly that they of the Government of Batavia are altogether blame|le&s;s, let us onely con&s;ider the moral impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of the fore&s;aid Fact, viz. that the Gover|nors
<PB N="19" REF="9">of Batavia &s;hould have rai&s;ed and fomen|ted the que&s;tions and differences between the Father and the Son, as al&s;o the notorious fal&s;e|hood of the &s;econd Fact, namely, that the &s;aid Government &s;hould have forced the King to cau&s;e the Engli&s;h to depart out of Ban|tam.</P>
<P>What concerns the fir&s;t, its known to the world, that for a long time, there had been no good intelligence between the Old King and the Government of Batavia, no not &s;o much as to the lea&s;t Corre&s;pondence, for the latter fin|ding them&s;elves much affronted and injured, in|&s;omuch that at la&s;t they took up Arms again&s;t each other, the Warr not ending until the Son came to the Crown, &s;o that they could not &s;tirr up the Son again&s;t the Father, muchle&s;s foment their quarrel.</P>
<P>And what follie would it have been for them of Batavia, to animate the Father to Warr a|gain&s;t the Son, fora&s;much as they lived with the Son in amitie, and as good Neighbors, not ha|ving any rea&s;on in the lea&s;t to complain of his Government and conduct towards them, whereas on the contrary if the Father had got the upperhand they &s;hould have been in a farr wors condition, and attracted a nieu Enemie a|gain&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>And that they &s;hould have &s;tirred up the Son again&s;t the Father, and encouraged him to Warr, cannot be imagined by any that are in their right &s;en&s;es, partly becau&s;e there by they
<PB N="20" REF="10">could not expect any profit or advantage, or if they had, it would have been mixt with an un|certaintie as to the event, and again the Son would then have endeavoured to have been a|forehand and the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or, whereas on the contrary it was the Father, who thereby got &s;o great advantage over the Son, burning and ruinating the City, and keeping his &s;aid Son be&s;ieged in his own Ca&s;tle, &s;o that, had it not been for the intervention and &s;uccours of them of Batavia, the Father certainly would have triumphed over the Son: and put the ca&s;e the Warr had ended according to the intention and advantage of the Son, what more could he have expected thereby, who already &s;ate on the Throne, and could be no greater then he was, would the Son have li&s;tned to &s;uch coun|&s;el, and engaged in a Warr again&s;t his Father, who&s;e Intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in governing his Kingdom in peace? And doth it not hence fol|low, that all the&s;e troubles did ari&s;e from them who breathed after nothing more then change? Who not being able or willing to &s;ubmit to the Government of the young King, revolted again&s;t him, with intention to thru&s;t him from his Throne, and to &s;et up another more &s;uitable to their liking and humor? Which their de&s;ign al&s;o &s;o farr &s;ucceeded, that the young King was brought to the point of loo&s;ing his Grown and Life.</P>
<P>Could the Government of Bantam at the beginning have with any rea&s;on imagined, that
<PB N="21" REF="10">the young King &s;hould finally have got the upperhand over his Enemies and Rebells? or that the Engli&s;h &s;hould have intermedled with that Warr, and would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Rebells again&s;t their own Prince, whom them&s;elves owned as lawful King (of which hereafter &s;hall be more largely &s;poken) and he thereupon &s;hould have thru&s;t the Engli&s;h out of his King|dom?</P>
<P>Would they have &s;tirred up the Son again&s;t the Father, after that the Son by &s;o many la|mentable Letters had implored their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and let it come to that extremity, that in ca&s;e they had delayed but one day longer, he mu&s;t have given him&s;elf over to his Rebels, and un|dergon a cruel death?</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the Rebels (before it was delivered by the Netherlandi&s;h forces) had taken the Ca&s;tle, and murthered the King, could they have hindred, that either the old King or one of his younger Sons &s;hould have obtained the Crown, and &s;o managed the affaires of his Kingdom, as to take vengeance of them, that had oppo&s;ed them&s;elves again&s;t his de|&s;igns.</P>
<P>And if &s;o be in ca&s;es of &s;uch nature place may be given to conjectures and pre&s;umptions, is it not mo&s;t probable, that the Engli&s;h them|&s;elves have done that very thing, which they fal&s;ly impute to the Netherlandi&s;h Company?</P>
<P>They Publi&s;h for a certain Truth, that the young King, while the Father as yet governd
<PB N="22" REF="11">the Kingdom, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated their Agent and Commi&s;es, and that he alwayes carried him&s;elf as an Enemy to them, whereas on the contrary the Government of the Father was mo&s;t grate|ful unto them.</P>
<P>Doth it then &s;eem to be &s;uch an ungrounded prae&s;umption, that they (partly to revenge them&s;elves of that Ma&s;&s;acre, of which the King of Great Brittain in his Letter to the now King of Bantam declareth him&s;elf &s;o &s;en&s;ible) and partly that it was much for their Intere&s;t, that the Son might be puld down from the Throne and put to death, and that the Father or another Brother were &s;et up; they &s;hould labour to kindle the fire and foment this Warr? E&s;pecially hereunto concurring that they were &s;o &s;oon readie to join their forces to the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Father, without which the Father could not have obtained tho&s;e advan|tages, nor the Son been brought to &s;uch a Laborinth.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it will clearly appear, that all the mi&s;chief which is come to the Engli&s;h Compa|nie in this bu&s;ine&s;t, is wholy from the bad ma|nagement of affaires by their own Men and Mi|ni&s;ters in Bantam?</P>
<P>For the King of Great Brittain and the En|gli&s;h Companie acknowledge the young King for the alone King and Soverain.</P>
<P>But their Mini&s;ters declare him to be an U|&s;urper and a Rebel of the Father.</P>
<P>Their Ma&s;ters endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;etled peace with him.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="11">
<P>They &s;et them&s;elves formally again&s;t him as their Enemie.</P>
<P>Their Ma&s;ters Endeavour to oblige the Son by all means po&s;&s;ible, and &s;end great quantitie of all manner of Ammunition of Warr to him.</P>
<P>They do not only di&s;oblige him in all things, but even a&s;&s;i&s;t his Enemies with the provi&s;ion &s;ent to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Their Ma&s;ters in their fore-mentioned Let|ter, pray that God the Creator of Heaven and Earth, would ble&s;s and pro&s;per him.</P>
<P>They endeavour to bereave him of his Throne, and make him the mo&s;t mi&s;erable of men.</P>
<P>So that having by the&s;e unrighteou&s;s cour&s;es brought upon them&s;elves to be driven out of Bantam, they now known not how to excu&s;e the matter.</P>
<P>And being di&s;appointed in their de&s;ign, as fallen into the pit they digged for others, they are at their wits End and know not what to doe, &s;ome bodie mu&s;t be found out upon whom to lay the blame, and the next that comes to hand is the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, <HI>Hic mihi turbat aquas.</HI></P>
<P>But had they &s;ate &s;till, or had (as they would make the world believe) kept them&s;elves neu|tral, according to the will and foot&s;teps of their Ma&s;ters, or had they in &s;tead of helping the Old, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the young King, the&s;e diffi|culties nor que&s;tions had never happened.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="12">
<P>And how can the English with any &s;hew of rea&s;on di&s;pute or call in que&s;tion the Soverainty of the young King, &s;eeing it is a known ca&s;e, that the &s;ending and admitting of Amba&s;&s;adors and Agents, together with the making of Treaties and Alliances, are true tokens of a Soveraign power, and therefore all &s;uch as ad|mit and receive Amba&s;&s;ies, do thereby acknow|ledge the Soverainity of them that &s;end the &s;ame, which is al&s;o further owned by proffers of Alliances and Leagues, which cannot be erected but between Soveraigns.</P>
<P>Now as to the &s;econd Fact; to wit, that after the Netherlandish Company had got the young into their &s;nares and perfidiou&s;ly brought him under their yoke, they then &s;hould have forced him to the expul&s;ion of the Engli&s;h, This we have before manife&s;ted to be a fal&s;e fiction: For fir&s;t they ought not in a ca&s;e of &s;o great weight and tendency make &s;uch odious and malitious po&s;itions, except they had clear and convincing proofs at hand: There is not any one of the Witne&s;&s;es, which the Engli&s;h Companie have produced, that mentions a word thereof, or that &s;peakes of &s;nares in|to which they of Batavia cau&s;ed the young King to fall, or of any yoke under which, again&s;t all fidelity, they had brought him.</P>
<P>It is true, they produce in the Proce&s;s one Mr. Waite, &s;peaking of the departure of the Engli&s;h by order of the King, who relates onely of an hard conte&s;t between the &s;aid
<PB N="25" REF="12">King and Major Sr. Martin, before that or|der of cau&s;ing them to depart, could be ob|tained from him; but being, &s;aith he, alto|gether under the power of the Hollanders, he was nece&s;&s;itated thereunto, but be&s;ides what might be alledged to weaken this a&s;&s;er|tion, he confe&s;&s;eth, that what he witne&s;&s;eth thereof is not of his own knowledge, but that he believeth it to be true upon the cre|dit of per&s;ons of worth, which of it &s;elf is enough to reject the &s;ame, as al&s;o it is very ob&s;ervable what on this &s;ubject the fore&s;aid Sr. Martin and others with him doe declare: to wit, that the Conte&s;t was not to di&s;po&s;e the King to the ejection of the Engli&s;h, but to turn away the wrath and indignation of the King (which becau&s;e of their a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of his Father and the Rebels, he had taken up again&s;t them) and thereby to deliver them from the lo&s;s of all their Goods yea life it &s;elf, as out of revenge he had determined again&s;t them, which al&s;o was &s;o taken and acknowledged by the Engli&s;h Compagny at Bantam, when by their Agent they returned thanks unto the Mini&s;ters of the Netherlan|di&s;h Companie for their protexion. But &s;up|po&s;e the King had not been &s;o incen&s;ed a|gain&s;t them, as hath been &s;aid, and that he had not had de&s;ign at all to be avenged on them, yet the mere con&s;ideration of his &s;e|curity might have moved him to their ejection, as beeing a&s;&s;ured they a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Rebels, and
<PB N="26" REF="13">in apprehen&s;ion, that they as wel ver&s;ed in warkely affaires might from England or El&s;e|where reenforce them&s;elves with &s;hips and Sol|diers, be&s;ides the Perillous neighbourhood of their warehou&s;e to his Ca&s;tle, his Father laying round about Bantam with his armie, and keeping it yet for &s;om moneths be&s;ieged, and he as yet by his auxiliarie forces having onely the &s;ea open, might if he were not verie circum&s;pect, bee again &s;uddenly a&s;&s;aulted, or at lea&s;t, the Engli&s;h remayning in Bantam by &s;pying all opportunities, make di&s;coveries to the enemies, &s;o as in way of providence it was requi&s;ite for him to do what he did.</P>
<P>If the Letters, (brought in the Proce&s;&s;e) be reviewed, it wil appear, whither it be true, as is imputed to them, that they of their own mo|tion did &s;end &s;uccours to the &s;aid King, yea &s;o as thereby (if their mo&s;t injurious a&s;per&s;ion were true) to get him into their Klutches or on the contrarie, that is was don at the Great and in&s;tant entreaties of the young King, after that al wayes of reconciliation had in vain bin attempted.</P>
<P>But fora&s;much as this a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;uccour is thus aver&s;lie and after &s;o odious a manner de|claimed, it will be nece&s;&s;aire to relate the &s;ame &s;omewhat more fully, and more clearly to di&s;|cover the occa&s;ion and progre&s;&s;e thereof.</P>
<P>After the Rulers of Batavia had ripely con&s;ul|ted about the con&s;titution of the affaires of the young King, they thought meet, as al&s;o hath before bin &s;pecified; to proffer their &s;ervice of
<PB N="27" REF="13">Mediation, between the Father and the Son, to which end they wrote two Letters in civil and obliging termes, te&s;tifying their purpo&s;e and af|fection in a way of frind&s;hip to accommodate and lay by their que&s;tions and differences, and with that Intention &s;ent thir Plenepotentiaries with Letters, the one to the Father, and the other to the Son in a Ship prepared to that end, after that &s;om dayes before by way of advance they had al&s;o &s;ent three other Ships, but con&s;ide|ring tho&s;e Plenipotentiaries went unto a place where the parties on both &s;ides were in armes, and not being certain whither they might meet with friends or enemies, they therfore judged them&s;elves obliged to put them into a po&s;ture of defence, furni&s;hing them with weapons in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;itie to make re&s;i&s;tance to &s;ueh, as for|getting the right of nations (e&s;pecially in that confu&s;ed &s;tate of things) and the re&s;pect that ought to be given to publick Per&s;ons, might po&s;&s;iblie attempt to lay hold on and injurie them, and this is that fleet of Ships and Barcks which in the&s;e and other of their writings they &s;o much enhance and make a &s;tir about, as &s;ent to Bantam to land our Troupes there.</P>

<P>The which al&s;o in a following Letter to the Major St. Martin he further confirmed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the &s;aid King did afterward make often Complaints to the whole World, that the En|gli&s;h had given all a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his enemies: yea one of the Engli&s;h them&s;elves, relates in a cer|tain book printed at London, in which he
<PB N="30" REF="15">gives an account of what pa&s;&s;ed at Bantam du|ring the warre, and of which he was eye-wit|ne&s;&s;e, viz. that they of the Engli&s;h nation had furni&s;hed the old King with mo&s;t of all the Am|munition he had, and withal, that they u&s;ed all means po&s;&s;ible to encourage and encen&s;e the Javans again&s;t the Dutch: and thereupon he con|cludes, that they (to with the Engli&s;h) had no ground much to rely upon the frien&s;hip of the Netherlanders, in ca&s;e they once came to &s;et foot on land: Notwith&s;tanding they are not a&s;ha|med to deny al this, yea in the Memorial deli|vered by Mr. Chardin (while he was here) and &s;econded and further confirmed by a certain Memorial, which the Engli&s;h Companine, to|gether with their demands, delivered over to the Commi&s;&s;aries, who were to decide on both &s;ides, namely, that the Engli&s;h in all this while, had kept them&s;elves altogether neutral between the &s;aid oppo&s;ing parties, and conclude from thence, that the King had not out of his motion cau&s;ed them to depart, but thro the In&s;tigation of the Major St. Martin (a thing mo&s;t notori|ous fal&s;e) as at the beginning they clamoured and publi&s;hed to the whole world, namely that we drave them out with force, after a mo&s;t barbarous and unheard of manner.</P>
<P>So then it appeares on both &s;ides that their de|parture was cau&s;ed by the Kings order, who only hath powr of Command in his country, and who&s;e command they were bound to obey: But it is denyed, and there is rea&s;on to prote&s;t
<PB N="31" REF="15">again&s;t Injurie don us, as if we had bin the effe|cters of the &s;ame.

<P>They remon&s;trate, that in a certain hearing, which the King of Bantam granted them &s;oon after the obtained Victorie; they could not per|ceive the lea&s;t di&s;temper, or Indignation, but that indeed there were &s;ome hot words pa&s;&s;ed between the King and Sr. Martin: But, I pray, is this a proof to convince as to a crime, e&s;pe|cially of &s;uch nature as this? We neither may nor can rely upon the ge&s;ture and countenance of any, muchle&s;s of a King, e&s;pecially of an Indian Prince, who &s;eeks to keep in his wrath and indignation, and to take his be&s;t opportu|nity to avenge him&s;elf: Is there any one that ever heard that Major Sr. Martin in&s;tigated the King to cha&s;e the English? Is there any thing produced in the lea&s;t tending thereto? Certainly nothing: on the contrarie the &s;aid Sr. Martin as a Man of honor, a Gentleman of qualitie, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing mode&s;tie, wi&s;dom and learning, wholie takes of all &s;ini&s;ter &s;u&s;pition, in prote&s;ting that the intercour&s;e with the King was entended to no other end, then to divert and take of the
<PB N="32" REF="16">King from the de&s;ign he had to de&s;troy all the Engli&s;h, and &s;hould he not to doe &s;o, have had much more rea&s;on, then, as the Engli&s;h Com|panie in their Demand given in again&s;t the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, and more amply in their Reply doe a&s;&s;ert, that he &s;ome years be|fore had cau&s;ed the Agent of the English Com|panie to be murthered, together with their Co|mi&s;es, of which they afterwards made &s;uch heavie complaints, yet nothing followed there|upon: Is it then to be wondred at, that he was &s;o greatly incen&s;ed becau&s;e of this their action, that except he had forceablie bin di&s;waded by Sr. Martin, he had cau&s;ed them all to be &s;lain? They endeavour al&s;o to make the Netherlandi&s;h Companie or their Mini&s;ters &s;u&s;pected to have an hand, likewi&s;e in this Action, but they are ne|ce&s;&s;itated to prote&s;t again&s;t this outragious in|jurie and Calumnie, They who at the &s;ame time were &s;o highly out of favour with the old King then reigning, would certainly be far from having an hand in &s;o horrible a Murther, by which they could not in any re&s;pect be ad|vantaged: If that William Kaef the Nether|landi&s;h Re&s;ident at Bantam, when the Old King overthrew and &s;accaged the Citie, was fain for to e&s;cape ma&s;&s;acring, to retire to Ba|tavia leaving all the Goods and Effects of the Netherlandi&s;h Compagnie in their Lodge, which undoubtedly was by &s;ome Engli&s;h, though perhaps without the knowledge of their Ma&s;ters in part &s;tolen: &s;hould not then
<PB N="33" REF="16">the Engli&s;h, had they not in that furie been pro|tected by the Netherlandish forces, have been in far greater danger? Would there have bin any appearance for any of them to have e&s;caped with their lives? And neverthele&s;s according to their &s;aying, It is the Dutch that cau&s;ed all the&s;e Troubles and Mi&s;chiefs to befal them. But the Engli&s;h were not then of that opinion, nor u&s;ed &s;uch kind of Language, when they came &s;o &s;olemnly to declare their thankfulne&s;s to the Dutch, for their good will and protection they had &s;hewed to them.</P>
<P>But how little the Engli&s;h Companie doth agree with it &s;elf, and how often they are out and in in their writings, doth hereby appear, that in what they have depo&s;ed by form of de|mand, them&s;elves &s;ay, that their Agent and the Councel the day after the rai&s;ing of the Siege, were with the King in his Ca&s;tle, to take of and appea&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, the Chagrin and wrath of the King &s;o hot again&s;t them, and that they then found him by far le&s;s incen&s;ed then the Hollanders &s;aid he was: Farthermore in their &s;aid Memorial, which they delivered over, together with the fore&s;aid pretences, and to which by the fore&s;aid Demand they adhere, they &s;ay, that the &s;ame day they were introduced to the King, who laid before them many accu&s;a|tions, not &s;o much as permitting them to &s;peak a word for their defence.</P>
<P>It followeth then, that whereas they &s;aid, when they were brought in before him, they
<PB N="34" REF="17">could not in the lea&s;t perceive in his po&s;ture or vi&s;age any token of indignation, is a pure un|truth.</P>
<P>But yet further to convince the Engli&s;h Company of the fal&s;ehood of what they im|pute to the Netherlandi&s;h Companie, and that after &s;o odious a manner, it is only needful to look over the An&s;wer of the Netherlandish Companie to the complaints brought in by Mr. Chudley and Sr. John Chardin, in May 1682. whereby the &s;ame doth te&s;tifie a &s;uper-abounding affection and perfect readine&s;s to contribute to all meanes and wayes of ree&s;ta|bli&s;hing of the English Company there, by em|ploying their Credit and Authoritie with the pre&s;ent King, as al&s;o to reconcile the two contending parties, according to a <HI>Medium</HI> therein propo&s;ed, and &s;o con&s;equently to re|cal our Troups out of the Kingdom of Ban|tam.</P>
<P>Now it can ea&s;ily be conceived, they would not have done all this, in ca&s;e that by their meanes that Warr had been rai&s;ed, or that they had had an hand in the cha&s;ing of the En|glish, or had cau&s;ed the &s;ame, muchle&s;s if it had been true, as is malitiou&s;ly imputed to them, that for many yeares &s;ince they had plot|ted, for to draw, and by that meanes to engro&s;&s;e the whole Pepper-Trade unto them|&s;elves, and that as they affirm, to the ine&s;ti|mable dammage of the English Compagnie, of which &s;hall be further &s;poken hereafter.
<PB N="35" REF="17">And &s;eeing then it is a fal&s;e Fiction, that the Dutch Companie &s;hould have driven the En|glish out of Bantam, although perhaps it might have been (which neverthele&s;s was ne|ver directly nor indirectly attempted) that by &s;ugge&s;tion they might have &s;omewhat contri|buted thereunto; yet hereby al&s;o their preten|ded action of dammage and reparation doth fall of it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But that of which al&s;o, they have made an hideous cry and tintamar, by an expre&s;s com|plaint in their fore&s;aid Memorial, which in May 1683. they pre&s;ented to your Pui&s;&s;. Highne&s;&s;es, and which they more fully dilated afterward, is fir&s;t, that the day after the deliverance of the King, one James de Roy, Lieutenant of the Companie of Major St. Martin, &s;hould have taken down the Flag named the Banner of St. George, planted upon the Hou&s;e of one Captain John Fi&s;her, that the &s;aid Fi&s;her thereupon making ha&s;te to his Hou&s;e found the &s;aid de Roy with a part of the Flag in his hand, having torn the re&s;t, and given it to his Souldiers to make Scarfs of.</P>
<P>Again the &s;aid Souldiers had drunk out part of the Drinking-wares, and taken away the re|mainder together with his houshold-&s;tuff, and withall evilly entreated him, and placed &s;ome black Moores in his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that five dayes after the departure of the English from Bantam, our Souldiers came into the Hou&s;e of the English Companie,
<PB N="36" REF="18">and had &s;ent &s;ome Moores (of their Servants) to fetch of the Pavillion that was di&s;plaid on their Lodge.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e all this to be a true &s;torie, and might thereupon give credit at the depo&s;ition of one man only, to wit, the fore&s;aid Captain Fi&s;her, and that al&s;o in his own ca&s;e, for fur|ther Witne&s;&s;es are not brought for proof of this Fact, yet it is con&s;iderable the Actor hier|of was in &s;ervice of the King, and not as is ve|ry abu&s;ively &s;aid, the Lieutenant of Major Sr. Martin, and con&s;equently the Souldiers were Bantamers: and it is worthie of ob&s;ervation, fora&s;much as this Jaques de Roy is &s;o ofsen brought upon the Stage, that he is a per&s;on, who &s;omewhile before the Warr, was retired from Batavia to Bantam, for to &s;hun his Cre|ditors, whom the young King took into his &s;ervice, who had in and during the Warr &s;ig|nalized him&s;elf by &s;pecial &s;ervices, wherefore al&s;o he was highly e&s;teemed by the &s;aid King, though him&s;elf were a man of little worth.</P>
<P>Again, although the fore&s;aid fir&s;t Flag (for there is mention made of two) might have been the Banner of St. Gerge, yet could it not bring any re&s;pect to a private Hou&s;e, and there|by to be freed from the di&s;orders that in time of Warr are incident, more then to any other Hou&s;e, &amp; what concerns the Banner &amp; u&s;e made thereof, is that a thing to cau&s;e &s;o much di&s;tur|bance, that a Captain of the King &s;hould with his Souldiers take down from a private Hou&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="18">the English Flag, after that the King and the whole Nation lookt on him as an Enemie of his Per&s;on and of the State?</P>
<P>What concerns the &s;econd part, although the relation thereof might perhaps be accord|ing to trueth, which neverthele&s;s is doubted of, and cannot be prooved, it doth not touch the Dutch Companie, yea though it had been don by their Men: but mu&s;t be imputed to the di&s;orders in War.</P>
<P>As to the third point, if the recital thereof be according to trueth, and that they &s;ent &s;ome of their black Servants to take down the Ban|ner, which notwith&s;tanding is nothing but a report and recital of &s;ome Chine&s;es, this doth nothing to the charging of the Netherlandish Companie, the &s;aid Chine&s;es might be de|manded, how they came to know tho&s;e Moores were Servants of the Dutch Souldiers and not of the King, as is much more probable, &s;eeing it &s;hould be an unu&s;ual thing, at lea&s;t unheard of among us, that &s;imple Souldiers should have Moores to their Servants: but po|&s;ito that the Dutch Souldiers might have been Executors of the Kings Order therein: the Kings Right is inconte&s;table, and he might take away the Pavillion of the English, after that he had banished them out of his Countrie, yea though the Souldiers had don it without the Order of the King, which is not likely, yet had it been nothing el&s;e then a Militarie In&s;o|lence, which al&s;o mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the di&s;|orders
<PB N="38" REF="19">of War, where the Lawes of Mode&s;ty and Deceneie are &s;eldom regarded, and there|fore without inju&s;tice cannot be imputed to them, who in the time of the War at Bantam did repre&s;ent the Government of Batavia, who never were behinde hand, in that re&s;pect which they ow to Crowned Heads; but what need is it to have recours to conjectures, where|as by a certain produced depo&s;ition it is appa|rent, that it was the King him&s;elf who com|manded the Flag to be taken down from the English Lodge: and what is &s;aid of the Dutch Flags which after the Victorie were planted upon the Ca&s;tle and in other parts of the City, de&s;erves no An&s;wer, &s;ince its a known thing that we never pretended any territorial Right in Bantam, muchle&s;s put the &s;ame in execu|tion: but however the &s;aid Flags &s;erved to no other purpo&s;e, then to make it known to the Dutch Troupes, who after the rai&s;ing of the Siege, were po&s;ted in the principal places of the City according to the u&s;ual practi&s;e every where in like occa&s;ions. The Flag upon the Ca&s;tle was &s;et up by order of the King to &s;hew honor to the Dutch, however placed under the Flag of the King.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides they of the Engli&s;h Company com|plain, that the day after the rai&s;ing of the &s;iege, the Dutch Re&s;ident Kaeff with a Troop of Souldiers and &s;ome Ma&s;ons came into the En|gli&s;h Lodge, and ordered the Engli&s;h Agent forthwith to take away the Galeries, and to
<PB N="39" REF="19">naile up the Windowe: And that thereupon a Dutch Renegate, who was in his Company, began pre&s;ently to threaten him, that if the English did not, he him&s;elf would do it, which al&s;o, as they &s;ay, he really did.</P>
<P>This &s;eemeth to be an outragious act don to the English: but if we look into the nature of the thing, it will be found to be a meer trifel, which they ought to be a&s;hamed to urge in this manner:</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torie is this: Becau&s;e the Dutch Companie would not be trouble&s;om to any, they cho&s;e their own Lodge at Bantam for their Maga&s;in of Arms, and other provi&s;ions. Now the Wall of their &s;aid Lodge touching part of the Engli&s;h Compagnies dwelling Hou&s;e, and in that &s;aid Wall they formerly had had no other opening be&s;ide a ca&s;ement: Somewhile af|ter the English by permi&s;&s;ion of the Old King, who let &s;lip no opportunitie to affront &amp; mole&s;t them, made great wide windows, to open and &s;hut, and be&s;ides that a Gallirie al&s;o which hanging four or five foot over the ground of the Hollanders Lodge, gave the Engli&s;h oppor|tunity to hear and &s;ee all what ever the Dutch did: The young King con&s;idering that our &s;aid Lodge in time of Warr, was like to be the great Maga&s;in, thought it requi&s;ite to prevent &s;uch dangerous con&s;equences as might be occa&s;ioned by overtures, being over a place of the Hou&s;e, where the Powder and other Ammonitions of Warr did lay, and out or through which win|dows
<PB N="40" REF="20">or overtures in the wall, the English at all times might com upon that place, at their plea&s;ure: and knowing the English would not &s;eale up tho&s;e Windowes, nor &s;uffer the Galli|ries to be taken away, he thereupon &s;ent his &s;er|vants with a Dutch Renegado, to cau&s;e it to be don; and it may perhaps be true, that the Re&s;ident Kaeff was at that time pre&s;ent, fora&s;|much as it was don in the &s;aid Lodge of the Dutch Companie, where according to his Office he was to take care of the Maga&s;in.</P>
<P>What evil can herein be imputed to the com|panie, and what accu&s;ation can the Engli&s;h frame from this? A thing which way &s;o ever they take it, was carried on by the authoritie of the King, and according to their &s;aying executed by a Re|negado, the verie naming of whom &s;hews, that he was not in &s;ervice nor under the Oath of the Netherlandi&s;h Companie.</P>
<P>And what be&s;ides this they lay to the Charge of the duteh Companie, is, fir&s;t that they &s;hould have taken from the English their hor&s;es, and &s;om other things, and have eon&s;trayned them to take out the Powder that was in their Ships and to bring it a &s;hore.</P>
<P>Secondly, that what they, at the command of the King to depart, in al ha&s;te had laden in their boats to bring aboard their Ships, in which neyther the people of the Countrie, nor the Sol|diers did any wayes hinder them, but pa&s;&s;ing by the Engli&s;h Chalops which kept the watch at &s;ea, they were by them arre&s;ted, under pre|tence,
<PB N="41" REF="20">they had order to &s;uffer nothing to be car|ried aboard the Engli&s;h Ships, and in ca&s;e they per&s;i&s;ted to do it they &s;hould be &s;hot at, by which they &s;hould have bin nece&s;&s;itated to return to Land with their Boats.</P>
<P>Thirdly that they complaying of &s;uch vio|lence to Major St. Martin, he in a je&s;ting way &s;hould an&s;wer, that al was don by order from the King, whereas no man on Land, Soldier or others had a hand in tho&s;e Violences, but all was don by our Soldiers onely.</P>
<P>Forthly, that the Chief of the French requi|ring of the King re&s;titution of four Chi&s;ts with Silver which was taken from him, the King &s;hould an&s;wer in the pre&s;ence of the Dutch Commi&s;&s;arie, that he knew nothing thereof, and that he would do no injurie neither to them, nor to the Engli&s;h, Danes, or other Stran|gers trafficking in his Countrie, and in ca&s;e any wrong had bin don unto him, &s;ince the Hollan|ders had &s;et foot on Land, that he mu&s;t require reparation from the Duth Commi&s;&s;arie, or the General at Batavia.</P>
<P>Fiftly, that at the la&s;t in&s;tance made, to cau&s;e the Engli&s;h to quit Bantam, being, as they &s;ay, the day before their departure, our Soldiers came into the Engli&s;h Lodge, robbed the Cham|bers, and took away all they found there; where|upon the people of the country (&s;o far were they from doing them the lea&s;t wrong) permitted them to &s;eal up their Maga&s;in and undertook to keep it &s;afe for them.</P>
<PB N="42" REF="21">
<P>What Concerns the fir&s;t point, &s;orasmuch as they do not onely not &s;ay, much le&s;&s;e prove, that our men &s;hould have taken the hor&s;es and and other goods from the Engli&s;h, nor that they &s;hould have con&s;trained them to fetch their powder out their Ships, therefore the Nether|landi&s;h Companie wil pa&s;&s;e that by, as a thing which doth not concern them, and of which they are wholy di&s;charged by the often fore|mentioned Memorial annexed to the demand or preten&s;e which the Engli&s;h Companie depo&s;ed and delivered in, and to which they do referre them&s;elves, in which is expre&s;&s;ely &s;aid, that Pagoran Diepa Panerat, one of the principal Mini&s;ters of the young King, or rather the fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of State, had don the &s;ame, although they put it in &s;uch General and ambiguous ex|pre&s;&s;ions, in all appearence, as if they would lay it to the Charge of our Men: Onely what concerns the Powder, the Dutch companie doth &s;ay, that in ca&s;e it were true, that the Engli&s;h were fain by the order of the King to unlade the &s;ame and bring it to Land, that it was don not becau&s;e the King &s;tood in need of it, for he was abundantly furnished by them of Batavia, but only to prevent that they might not deliver the &s;ame to his enemies, and be&s;ides it cannot be ill taken, that the King in that confu&s;ed &s;tate of things, would oppo&s;e and hinder the Engli&s;h from going &s;o often too and fro to their Ships.</P>
<P>Concerning the &s;econd point, namely that
<PB N="43" REF="21">we &s;hould have hindred the Engli&s;h from de|parting out of Bantam, and al&s;o to have &s;top|ped their boats, hath not the lea&s;t appearance of truth in it, fora&s;much as them&s;elves con|fe&s;&s;e, that we a&s;&s;i&s;ted them with our Boats and Chalops to carrie their goods and wares a bord their Ships, when none of the people of the countrie, or their Boats could be obtained to be &s;erviceable to them therein, &s;o little accep|tance they had with that Nation, and how can this hang together, that we &s;hould have procu|red their departure from the King, and then when they were readie to depart, to hinder it, yea the Engli&s;h di&s;agree in the verie po&s;ition laid down about it, for their fore&s;aid Memoriall, to which by their demand, they refer them&s;elves, dictates not that their men were &s;topt at Sea by our Barks that kept watch, but that it was don by the watch of the Netherlandi&s;h Companie on Land at the mouth of the haven, to wit, as ha|ving order to &s;uffer nothing to be carried from Land to the Engli&s;h Ships.</P>
<P>The complaints which thereupon they &s;hould have made to Major St. Martin comprehended in the third point, as if he had in a kind of mock|age, an&s;wered them, that all was don by or|der of the King, what doth this make to the thing? for put the ca&s;e the &s;aid Major (which not with&s;tanding is not granted) might &s;ay, not in way of Mockage, but in earne&s;t, that it was to be imputed to the order of the King, which goes farther, if tho&s;e orders had bin executed by our
<PB N="44" REF="22">Soldiers, although that al&s;o is denyed, and of which the Engli&s;h doe produce no proofs, yet could it not any wayes prejudice the Dutch Companie as not being bound to be re&s;pon&s;able for the Orders of the King.</P>
<P>Touching the Kings an&s;wer to the Chief of the French his complaint, and that the King remitted him as to that matter to Batavia, of which is &s;poken in the forth point, although it &s;hould be al true, which notwith&s;tanding is not proeved, it might be that the King did it in &s;uch a manner to free him&s;elf from the trouble of tho&s;e complaints, as wel knowing that one of his Mini&s;ters had cea&s;ed on the &s;aid Chefts with &s;ilver, which however it be, neither concerns the English, nor obligeth the Dutch Companie to be an&s;werable for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But to demon&s;trate yet more fully how far the English Companie in all their pretences do aberre from the truth, they &s;ay, as may be &s;een, in the propo&s;all of the fir&s;t point, that the peo|ple of the Countrie, to wit, of Bantam, the day before they, viz. the English were cau&s;ed to remove, did indeed com into their Lodge, but without doing of them the lea&s;t Injurie, and yet they &s;ay in their fore&s;aid Memorial anexed to their Demand, that at the &s;ame time they took away all their provi&s;ion driving the English out of the Chambers (except one named, Waite) and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof; but a little after the Dutch Soldiers came who further made &s;poil, and carried away al they found there: But this
<PB N="45" REF="22">can not be: becau&s;e the Engli&s;h had a day be|fore their departure carried away for Batavia in the Ships of the Dutch Company all their Moveables, to the very lea&s;t thing of any worth (their departure, as them&s;elves &s;ay, being the 12. of April) and &s;o nothing could be found: and be&s;ides all the time of their inhabiting of Batavia. which dured more then a year, they never brought in any complaints, by a Li&s;t or other way &s;hewing, what the Dutch Souldiers had rob'd them of, but on the contrary they came and rendred their thancks to the Govern|ment there, for all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance had been don unto them, without the lea&s;t mention of wrong received: which had they don, the Go|vernment there might forthwith have cau&s;ed enquirie to be made, and if it had been true, procured &s;atisfaction; but letting that occa|&s;ion &s;lip, and being negligent therein, and then to bring in their Complaints hier, and that without any proof, the Dutch &s;ay is a thing al|together unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>As hath before been alledged, the Engli&s;h Compagny from the beginning hath pretended ree&s;tablishment at Bantam from the Dutch Companie, and to which in their Demand or Memorial of their pretences delivered over to the Commi&s;&s;aries of both &s;ides, they remain per&s;i&s;ting, with reque&s;t that the &s;ame may in the fir&s;t place before all other things be deba|ted and determined, taking for their founda|tion, that that ree&s;tablishment had alreadie bin
<PB N="46" REF="23">accorded and agreed to by you Pu. Highne&s;&s;es and by the Netherlandish Company.</P>
<P>But now not yet content with that, they praetend by their fore&s;aid Demand be&s;ides the recalling of the Dutch Troops, the delivering over the Ca&s;tle of Bantam in its entire, for to put into it a &s;trong Garri&s;on, pretending that otherwi&s;e they would not be willing to &s;ettle them&s;elves again there, yea they require that the whole Citie be delivered up, and put into the hands of his Maje&s;ty of Great Brittain.</P>
<P>What concerns the fir&s;t, it is true indeed that the English Company did pretend all this, but it is evident, that the Dutch Company hath as little right to this, as to give over the whole City with the Ca&s;tle, according to their fur|ther pretence: We who have only a &s;imple re|&s;idence, without participation of any Autho|rity, which doth wholie re&s;ide in the per&s;on of the King, it is for us a moral impo&s;&s;ibility to di&s;po&s;e of that which <HI>Privative</HI> doth belong to the King, and &s;o to ree&s;tablish the English there again&s;t his will without intru&s;ion into his right, and violating his Authority: for al|though the Dutch Company hath their Troops in Bantam which &s;erve the King for a Gar|ri&s;on to defend his City, yet that affords them no Territorial right, nor the lea&s;t power to bring in again tho&s;e whom he hath bani&s;hed from thence.</P>
<P>And as they cannot by force of Arms oblige the King to take in again the English, and re|&s;ettle
<PB N="47" REF="23">them in Bantam without u&s;urping upon the Right of Nations, and de&s;ervedly to in|curre the di&s;affection and hatred of all the Princes and Potentates of Indie, &s;o can they with as little ground do it by threatnings, with|out injurie to their fidelity, which mu&s;t be the &s;tay of the credit of the &s;aid Companie among the Indian People, who otherwi&s;e would not rely upon their word, nor enter into Alliances, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nd combinations with them.</P>
<P>But they of the Engli&s;h Company averre, that herein not only con&s;i&s;ts their intere&s;t, but they have al&s;o the promi&s;e of your Pui. High|ne&s;&s;es, they onely requiring the Execution of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As to their Intere&s;t the Dutch Company will ea&s;ilie grant, that the fore&s;aid ree&s;tabli&s;h|ment might be for their advantage (although they, as hath before bin &s;aid, declare that ex|cept they have a Garri&s;on, and the Ca&s;tle for their &s;ecurity they would not re&s;ide there) &s;o al|&s;o undoubtedly it would be for their intere&s;t, if the Dutch Company did admit them into tho&s;e Countries, where we have our &s;pices, and which we po&s;&s;e&s;s by propriety, with &s;eclu&s;ion of all others: and &s;o al&s;o it would be for the intere&s;t of this State and the Inhabitants there|of, that the Engli&s;h would permit them the Na|vigation and trade in the Barbados, Caribes, New-England, the Virgines, and many other Countries they po&s;&s;e&s;s in America, where they will not &s;uffer us, nor other Nations of Eu|rope
<PB N="48" REF="24">&s;o much as to pa&s;s their Seas. But the Que&s;tion in this ca&s;e is not, the convenience or Intere&s;t but the Right. If that the Engli&s;h Company could groundedlie maintain, that the Dutch Company is bound to re&s;ettle them there, and prove it by cleare and convincing rea&s;ons that they had driven them out of Ban|tam, the bu&s;ine&s;s were at an end.</P>
<P>But to come to their &s;econd ground, viz. the promi&s;e of your Pui. Highne&s;&s;es, and of the Dutch Company, which was made to them Anno 1683&punc; that they &s;hould be re&s;etled there: To this we have before &s;aid, and do now again an&s;wer, that tho&s;e Proffers do &s;erve for an un|deniable proof, that the Dutch Companie &s;ought nothing more then to continue with the Engli&s;h Company in an intimate Friend&s;hip and Confidence, which by that accident at Ban|tam did &s;eem in &s;ome mea&s;ure to be interrup|ted, and that they would rather decline the ad|vantages which by &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive expences they had acquired there, then to remain continually in contention and quarrel with the Engli&s;h Company: and hereby the Dutch Company oblitterate tho&s;e a&s;pen&s;ions and calumnies im|puted unto them, as if in all appearance they for their own Intere&s;t and wilfully had incited and fomented the Differences, and warr that followed thereupon, between the Father and the Son, and had two yeares before formed that de&s;ign by corre&s;ponding with Pangoran Diepa Nagara, and &s;o contrived the bani&s;hing of the
<PB N="49" REF="24">Engli&s;h out of Bantam: For if all this had bin true, they &s;hould verie badly have managed their bu&s;ine&s;s, after that all was thus &s;ucceeded, and they with &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive charges attained what they aimed at, they &s;hould then without any pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;itie have made &s;o little ac|count of it, and that for the mere plea&s;ure of them, who for all the pretences, and ju&s;tifi|cation of their complaints made, had nothing to &s;hew in way of proof: Indeed had the En|gli&s;h Company, at that time re&s;ted &s;atisfyed, the Dutch Companie &s;hould have been obli|ged to perform the &s;ame, how praejudiciable &s;oever it might afterward have been to them: But fora&s;much as the Engli&s;h Company was then plea&s;ed wholie to reject and break of tho&s;e tran&s;actions, whereas we &s;o de&s;irou&s;ly longed that they might be brought to a good end in England, and for which, as is &s;aid, the Lord Amba&s;&s;ador Citters was fully authori&s;ed, al the time that bu&s;ine&s;s of Bantam was in the termes, as they were, during the Negotia|tions, and treatie with Mr. Chudly and Sr. John Chardin in the Hague, and which the Engli&s;h Company al&s;o cau&s;ed to be broken of: where|upon it fals now to be enquired into, whi|ther the Dutch Companie, &s;ince the ca&s;e of things be wholie changed and of an other nature, be &s;till obliged to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is evident that at that time the State of the affaires of Bantam was not known, na|mely, whither the warr between the Father
<PB N="50" REF="25">and the Son were yet remaining, or ended; if it were determined, whither by an accom|modation or by the Sword: If by the Sword, who of the two, the Father, or Son, re|mained Conqueror, and thereby become ma|&s;ter of the Kingdom: During which uncer|taintie, it can not be judged imprudencie, that the Netherlandi&s;h Ea&s;t-Indie Company (by who&s;e forces the Son was delivered from his inevitable ruin, and by whom he further was to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, &s;o as not to fall under the oppre&s;&s;ion of his rebellious Subjects) &s;hould interpo&s;e their credit and authority by the &s;aid King for the &s;etling of the En|glish in Bantam, if he were Conqueror, and with condition the English &s;hould yield no further a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Father: and in ca&s;e the Father were Victor, that then the En|glish &s;hould imploy all their credit by the Father, that the Dutch Company might en|joy a good Neighborhood with them: and the&s;e Proffers of the Dutch Companie, while things &s;tood thus at an uncertaintie, were the more excu&s;able by the King of Bantam, be|cau&s;e they endeavoured thereby to prevent the &s;uccours which the English Company pretended to &s;end the Father, and al&s;o be|cau&s;e at that time it was not yet known, how far the English had made them&s;elves irrecon|cilable to him.</P>

<P>Seeing then from all what hath been &s;aid, it clearly appeareth, that the English Companie did rather cho&s;e to expect the uncertain Lot of Warr, then to agree with the Dutch Com|pany, while it was time, about their Set|lement, it is therefore rea&s;onable that they now acquie&s;ce, and leave the Netherlandi&s;h Company unmole&s;ted, as to their ree&s;tabli&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>It followeth therefore, that it is wholy be|&s;ides the purpo&s;e, at pre&s;ent to make u&s;e, or apply to their advantage the fore&s;ayd an&s;wer of your Pu: Highne&s;&s;es to the fore&s;aid Memorial, after they had rejected the fore&s;aid Proffer, and had determined not onely to ree&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves by force of Arms, but wholie to becom the Ma&s;ters of Bantam, and to that end to &s;et out a formidable Power of &s;hips and Men at &s;ea, though their Entreprize, as they them|&s;elves depo&s;e in their fore&s;aid reply, was &s;topt by his Maje&s;ty of happie Memorie, &amp; not &s;uffe|red to put forth to &s;ea: now this was the rea&s;on that they having formed &amp; being bu&s;ie about this de&s;ign, that the Charges thereof might not be fruitle&s;&s;e, did not only reject the Proffers a fore&s;ayd, of the Dutch Companie, but made &s;uch Exce&s;&s;ive Extravagant demands, as
<PB N="53" REF="26">the delivering up of the whole Citie of Bantam with the Ca&s;tle, although they wel knew that it neither would nor could bee accepted of us, or in ca&s;e they were accepted, that then they had attaind to what they aymed.</P>
<P>So long then as the State of things was at an uncertaintie, and it might be in doubt who of the twain father or &s;on &s;hould have the upper|hand, though the &s;onne &s;eemd by far more like|ly to prevail, neverthele&s;&s;e the Netherlands Companie judged, that in &s;uch a Con&s;titution of things, it could not be il taken that they en|tred with the English Companie into a treatic, how they might after the be&s;t way procure a peace between the two Kings, by interpo&s;ing their credit and &s;ervice of love, &amp; obtain the ree&s;tablishment of the Engli&s;h Companie; but al this being rejected by the Engli&s;h with di&s;daing, and that uncertaintie which then was, beeing brought to a Certaintie, &s;o as the whole bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e is becom of quite another Nature, that the Netherlandi&s;h Companie &s;hould yet be bound to perform, what they in the uncertain &s;tate of things did &s;hew them&s;elf willing un|to, the Netherlandi&s;h Companie apprehen|deth, that it in ju&s;tice cannot be required. For fir&s;t thereby, be&s;ides other con&s;iderations, they &s;hould certainly be made loo&s;ers of the &s;um of &s;ix times hundred thou&s;and Ryxdallers, which the King of Bantam by evening acounts is found endebted to the Dutch Companie, and of which a Contract is made with him in par|ticular,
<PB N="54" REF="27">in which he grants to their Company the Traffick in his Kingdom, &s;o long and until, he &s;hall come to be in a condition to repay the &s;ame to the Dutch Company: But that which be&s;ides this de&s;erves to be reflected upon, is, that the King of Bantam hearing a rumour that the Engli&s;h Company per&s;i&s;ted in their pretence of re&s;ettlement in Bantam, with the calling back of our Troopes thence, wrote to the Government of Batavia (even after he had &s;urmounted al difficulties) that in ca&s;e they &s;hould con&s;ent therein, and withdraw our Militia from thence, he &s;hould not be able to continue ma&s;ter in the work, but be nece&s;&s;ita|ted to retire to Batavia, in hope protection &s;hould not there be refu&s;ed him, and thereup|on be&s;ought in all humility, that they would at no hand for&s;ake, and reduce him to &s;uch ex|tremities, but perform their word given him by &s;olemn Contract. And how &s;hould the Ne|therlandi&s;h Companie be officious to their re|admi&s;&s;ion, &s;eeing the Engli&s;h Company in their writings do &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly decipher him, as namely, <HI>that he hath with the approbation of all the world acted again&s;t the English Nation as an Enemie, &s;o unthanckful, &s;o barbarous, with &s;uch antipathie from their Blood, without any the lea&s;t rea&s;on or provocation: that his Maje&s;ty of Great Brittain without injurie to his honour, may not re&s;t till he have &s;ecured him&s;elf of that City and whole Kingdom, until he have got reparation, and that the &s;ooner, becau&s;e he is, according to
<PB N="55" REF="27">their &s;aying, however he bear the title of King nothing el&s;e but a perfect Slave of Batavia, and a Servant to their will and plea&s;ure.</HI> High words indeed: al&s;o it is a wonderful Dilemma of the Engli&s;h Companie, to wit, if the Old King of Bantam have any right to Bantam, and the de|pendencies thereof, then the conclu&s;ion is mo&s;t &s;olid, that the &s;ame is devolved upon the de|cea&s;ed King of Great Brittain, of happy Memo|rie: And if the right appertains to the young King, as the Hollanders affirm, then he hath acted by the approbation of the whole World, again&s;t the Subjects of his &s;aid Maj. as an enemie, &amp; according to what they have deciphred him.</P>
<P>Concerning the fir&s;t member of this Dilem|ma, being it is evident, that the Old King of Bantam having given over his Kingdom to his Elde&s;t Son the pre&s;ent inheritor thereof, he now cannot afterward give it to another: the conclu&s;ion that follows hence is directly again&s;t the Engli&s;h Company. What concerns the &s;e|cond part of the Dilemma, if it be the young King to whom this right doth belong, and and that it be true, that he had acted again&s;t the Engli&s;h as an enemy ungrateful, barba|rous, and with antipathie to their blood, with|out the lea&s;t provocation, as indeed may be drawn, but neverthele&s;s not to ju&s;tifie the De|mand of the Engli&s;h Company again&s;t them of Holland, neither can any thing therefrom be concluded again&s;t the pre&s;ent King of Bantam, in ca&s;e he hath ju&s;tly, as he affirmeth, te&s;tifyed
<PB N="56" REF="28">his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the Engli&s;h: But in the mean while we cannot let pa&s;s, without ta|king notice that while they are plea&s;ed to heap up reproches upon the young King, then they &s;ay; <HI>he had acted again&s;t the Subjects of his Ma|je&s;ty as an enemie, ungrateful, barbarous, with an Antipathie of their Blood, without the lea&s;t provocation,</HI> further, that he is unworthy of alliance with them; but when the bu&s;ine&s;s is, to load the Dutch, and make them the Authors of their expul&s;ion out of Bantam, then they alter their &s;train, and &s;ay, <HI>that they could not &s;o much as ob&s;erve neither in the words or ge&s;ture of the King the lea&s;t thing manife&s;ting any di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t the English, or that he had a de&s;ign to make them depart out of his Connirie.</HI></P>
<P>Here, they name the pre&s;ent King a <HI>Slave of the Netherlandish Companie,</HI> and in their Reply they &s;ay, that <HI>the Old King, when he &s;ate on his Throne, would willingly have been a Slave of the King of England, and thereof would have made his triumph.</HI></P>
<P>In their Reply they give the mentioned King the name of a <HI>pauvre Idiot,</HI> a vile per|&s;on, <HI>une Chetive Creature,</HI> &amp;c. And in their let|ter they wrote to him in March 1683. they &s;tyl him a <HI>wi&s;e King,</HI> to whom they &s;ay, they will &s;end a per&s;on with the Title of <HI>Envoy</HI> or <HI>Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;ador,</HI> with full power to conclude an everduring League and Alliance with him.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Title the King of Great Brittain
<PB N="57" REF="28">giveth him in his fore mentioned Letter, &s;ti|ling him a <HI>wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>righteou&s;s Prince.</HI></P>
<P>On the contraire, the English Companie in their Triplick, call him <HI>a Murtherer,</HI> and <HI>Con|temner of the publick faith.</HI></P>
<P>And how odiou&s;ly the Engli&s;h Companie in their fore&s;aid Letter (annexing al&s;o, what they wrote to Pangoran Diepa Penerat, Chief Mi|ni&s;ter of State) have deciphred the Nether|landi&s;h Companie, and in what e&s;teem we were alreadie with them, even before the Warr of Bantam was kindled, the Dutch Companie will referre to the judgment of the Reader.</P>
<P>It hath already been mentioned, that the Engli&s;h Companie in their fore&s;aid Demand did pretend, be&s;ides the calling back of the Dutch Troopes, the deliverie al&s;o of the whole Citie and Ca&s;tle of Bantam, or el&s;e as they &s;aid they would not make their re&s;idence there again.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides that the English Commi&s;&s;aries, who were to decide the differences, did as hath been &s;aid, Judge, that this their demand, as altogether ungrounded and unrea&s;onable, ought to be denyed, &s;o it is a thing that doth &s;ufficient|ly refute it &s;elf.</P>
<P>For before the Warr of Bantam the Engli&s;h Companie had nothing there but a Lodge and &s;imple Re&s;idence, without the lea&s;t Territo|rial right: The King after he had triumphed over his Enemies, knowing that they had afford|ed all manner of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to them, and not being
<PB N="58" REF="29">at re&s;t as fearing their future mi&s;carriage, and e&s;pecially in this juncture of time, while he was yet &s;urroundred of Enemies, cau&s;es them to di&s;lodge: Hereupon now the English Compa|nie comes and demands the deliverie of the whole City and Ca&s;tle, having had nothing there, but as hath been &s;aid, a Lodge for Com|merce, and this they will have from the Ne|therlandish Companie, who have no right at all to di&s;po&s;e thereof, except they cha&s;e away the King that now is, out of Bantam, for to put it into the hands of the English, and ex|cept they could make it out, and to be agreable to ju&s;tice, that the Dutch Companie &s;hould threaten the pre&s;ent King to abandon and de|liver him over to the will and mercie of his Enemies, by remouving of their Troopes out of his Citie, whereas we are bound by Con|tract to maintain and protect him, &s;hould now falter in our word, and fal&s;elie our tru&s;t, a thing which may nor ought to be required of us.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that the Dutch Companies in|tent in this, is to monopoli&s;e all the trade of Pepper, and get it to them&s;elves wholie, and to this they ad, that &s;eeing the Netherlandish Companie having be&s;ides the trade of Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace and cinnamon, al this would make them able to maintain a fleet to with&s;tand the mightie&s;t King in Europe.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides that there are &s;o many other great countries in the Indies, where Pepper may be
<PB N="59" REF="29">had, and to which the Engli&s;h Companie have acces as wel as the Dutch, and that it is im|po&s;&s;ible, the Netherlandish Company &s;hould get them all under their power &amp; command, it ought to be called to mind, that when we were in trea|tie here with Sr. John Chardin, that we prof|fered the Pepper-trade in Common to the En|glish Companie, and that by the Contract which &s;hould be made with the King the half &s;hould be allotted them, of which an article was at that time made, and pre&s;ented in writing, but by the &s;aid Sr. John Chardin rejected, &s;o far was it from the Dutch Companies intention to de&s;ign the &s;ame, as its malitiously laid to their charge, and not only as to the Pepper-trade, but they add al&s;o in their Triplick, that the aim of the Dutch Company by this their Re&s;idence at Bantam, was be&s;ides the Pepper to engro&s;&s;e, to their ine&s;timable profit, the Linnen-Trade al&s;o: Whereas on the contrary the Dutch Companie in their fore&s;aid propo&s;als to Sr. John Chardin, be&s;ide the Pepper did admit them to the half of all other Wares, including the Linnen, which they al&s;o refu&s;ed, and not|with&s;tanding in their &s;aid Reply they further &s;ay, that al the endeavour of the Dutch Com|panie was whether by right or wrong to keep things in the &s;tate to which they had brought them.</P>
<P>The English Company had fir&s;t &s;et in their Demand they gave in, that by our re&s;idence at Bantam we had made the Pepper-Trade more
<PB N="60" REF="30">difficult to them, but in their forenamed Re|ply they &s;ay, that we made way to Monopo|li&s;e the whole, &s;o far may men be blinded by pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>To what the English Companie doe further depo&s;e in their fore&s;aid Demand, viz. that tho&s;e in pay, of the Dutch Companie, had upon the coa&s;t of Mallabar a&s;&s;aulted their Men, given fire on them, and this al&s;o to deprive them of the remainder of the Trade in Pepper they as yet had there: The Dutch could have wi&s;hed, they had more clearly declared them&s;elves as to the place where, the fore&s;aid Coa&s;t laying a|long&s;t the Sea the &s;pace of an hundred miles, as al&s;o to the year and time when, together to what Ship or Barck and upon what occa&s;ion: as on their part the Netherlandish Companie is readie the &s;hew after what manner they delt with our Men upon the We&s;t Coa&s;t of Suma|tra, to wit the English Fregat .... in Sep|tember 1683 being upon the Coa&s;t before Ayer Bangi, and &s;ending out his Chaloup with about fourtie armed Souldiers again&s;t our men &s;itting in a Boat, &s;hooting once and again with Bullets: As the Ships the Societie, the Prae&s;i|dent, the Eagel and Bercklie Ca&s;tle, who at their return homeward from Bantam, Corman|del and Bengale, in Iuly and the following Months of the year 1681. overwintering at the I&s;land Mauritius, committed no &s;mall in&s;olences and mi&s;chiefs, e&s;pecially they of the Prae&s;ident, and Eagel, robbing and carrying away all what
<PB N="61" REF="30">they found, notwith&s;tanding all the complaints and prote&s;tations made by the people of the Dutch Companie, of which we have authen|tick evidences in hand to &s;hew.</P>
<P>We pa&s;s by, that the Engli&s;h for &s;o many years have made it their con&s;tant work, to de|bauch our men at Bengale, on the Coa&s;t of Cormandel, at Bantam, and el&s;ewhere, to draw them out of our &s;ervice, to &s;erve them on their Ships homeward, (being weakly mand) again&s;t the prote&s;tations made from time to time, as is to be &s;hewn by evidences in hands of the Ne|therlandish Companie: That the English Com|panie is entended, as them&s;elves have divulged, to &s;et down and build a Fortre&s;&s;e on Priamang, &s;eated on the We&s;t Coa&s;t of Sumatra (a coun|trie under the command of the Dutch Com|pany, and where they have a Fort lying) which by the fir&s;t Letters that come, we ex|pect to hear that it is already effected, they ha|ving &s;ent to that end divers Ships, with Men, Materials, and warlike furniture: the mi&s;chief that hence will en&s;ue, may ea&s;ilie be ge&s;&s;ed at.</P>
<P>It is a thing inconceivable, how they dare publi&s;h to the world, that the Dutch Compa|nie by a contract made with them of Maca&s;&s;er November Anno 1667, and as they &s;ay, printed at Batavia, by which the English Nation was &s;ecluded from Commerce in that Countrie, and of which after the expiration of eighteen years, they make complaints in their writings: whereas &s;ince that time two &s;olemn Treati&s;es have been made betwixt England and this State,
<PB N="62" REF="31">be&s;ide the forenamed agreement of the year 167<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, by which all pretences and actions what|&s;oever, which might have been again&s;t each other, were nullifyed as if they never had bin, and although this &s;hould not be urged, the Dutch Compagnie is ready to ju&s;tifie what they did, by holding forth to the world their right in making &s;uch kind of Contracts: But what in this ca&s;e falls into &s;pecial con&s;ideration, is, that the fore&s;aid Contracts made by the Ne|therlandi&s;h Companie, was during the Warr with England, or before the peace concluded anno 1667. was, or could be known in the In|dies, or at Maca&s;&s;ar.</P>
<P>So then although all were true what is publi|&s;hed in a certain writing, and by Mr. Skelton, Envoy Extraordinarie, annexed to the fore|&s;aid Memorial, pre&s;ented to your Pui&s;. High|ne&s;&s;es, that we had violently &s;ea&s;ed on the Factors of the Engli&s;h Company, carried them away pri&s;onners to Batavia, and then &s;poiled their Hou&s;es (although the Companie, upon their Faith and Credit, are ignorant hereof) what could this any way help the Engli&s;h, or why &s;hould they thus exclaime about it? Hath not England about this verie time taken by force New-Netherland from our We&s;t-Indie Companie, &amp; can the Dutch We&s;t-Indie Com|panie frame an action or pretence hereon? With|out doubt, No.</P>
<P>The English Companie finding them&s;elves de&s;titute of nece&s;&s;arie proofs to make good
<PB N="63" REF="31">the matter of Fact, they charge the Dutch Companie with, which neverthele&s;s can only &s;erve as the foundation of what they urge, as al&s;o being convinced of the unan&s;werable con|futation made by the Dutch Companie, with mo&s;t evident demon&s;tration of the ungrounded|ne&s;s of the a&s;&s;ertions of the English Companie, they betake them&s;elves in their Reply to re|proches, calumniating the Dutch Companie in the conduct of their affaires after &s;o odious a manner, and in &s;uch extravagant termes, as mu&s;t needs make all men a&s;toni&s;hed, how peo|ple of honour and under&s;tanding &s;hould &s;o for|get them&s;elves, yea &s;o far as that the Engli&s;h Commi&s;&s;aries them&s;elves in the conference with the Commi&s;&s;aries who on our &s;ide were, to decide the bu&s;ine&s;s, were con&s;trained to abhor and manife&s;t their di&s;content thereof: And although the Dutch wanted no matter to convince the English Companie of their in|tollerable injurie, and to di&s;abu&s;e the World of &s;o many untruths falsly imputed to them, yet they judged it better to ab&s;tain and with a mode&s;t &s;ilence to pa&s;s it by, then enter into further conte&s;t, and make the rupture of the Friend&s;hip (which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary between both the Companies) yet greater, and the wound incurable.</P>
<P>The Demand the Dutch Company made by reconvention, con&s;i&s;ted herein, that they at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the English Companie had lent or accommodated them with four Ve&s;|&s;els,

<P>It remains that we &s;peak a word or two of what happened before Gamron in the Gulph of Per&s;ia, over which al&s;o the English Com|panie make their complaints, fir&s;t, in a certain Article in their Triplick, and afterward by that writing which the fore&s;aid Mr. Skelton Extraordinarie Envoy, annexed to the fore&s;aid Memorial by him pre&s;ented the .. of May la&s;t to your Pui&s;. Highne&s;&s;es, of which men|tion was made in the beginning: This Ar|ticle containes fir&s;t complaints again&s;t the con|duct of the Fleet, which lately the Dutch Company had in the Gulph of Per&s;ia with
<PB N="65" REF="32">which they entended, as they &s;ay, to &s;hut or lock up all the Havens of that great Kingdom.</P>
<P>And the &s;aid Memorial did further make like complaints that the fore&s;aid Fleet conducted by Reynier Ka&s;embroot, with violence &s;hould have hindred John Goldsborough Ma&s;ter of an Engli&s;h Companies Ship called the Marchant of Bengale, from onlading the &s;aid Ship with Boats, thereby detaintng and di&s;turbing him in all their traffick and bu&s;ine&s;s: but after exa|mination this complaint wil be found as ground|le&s;s, as any of the other.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is this, that the Netherlandi&s;h Companie time out of mind, having a Comp|toir or Lodge, together with their Traffick at Gamron, and other places in the Kingdom of Per&s;ia, by vertue of an agreement made with the King, and of Priviledges granted unto them, the Per&s;ians in many points &s;et them&s;elves in oppo&s;ition again&s;t them, offring them many outragious and unju&s;t dealings, and fora&s;much as no reparation or redres in the lea&s;t could be obtained by any reque&s;ts made, although ac|companied with extraordinarie and co&s;tlie pre|&s;ents, at la&s;t it bur&s;t forth into deeds, for to repair the injurie don, and this is the Fleet of Ships, which the Dutch Companie for this end had in the fore&s;aid Gulph, with which they took from the Per&s;ians the Jland Ki&s;mus with the Ca&s;tle in the &s;aid Gulph, not far di&s;tant from Ormus or Gamron, not for to keep, for it could not have been &s;erviceable to us, but with
<PB N="66" REF="33">intollerable charge, onely it was don to induce and nece&s;&s;itate the Per&s;ians to conde&s;cend to rea&s;on, which it al&s;o effected, whereupon the Netherlandi&s;h Companie re&s;tored the I land and the Ca&s;tle to the Per&s;ians again.</P>
<P>What then concerns the fir&s;t complaint, that with that Fleet the Netherlandi&s;h Companie &s;ought to &s;hut up all the Havens in Per&s;ia, the Netherlandi&s;h Companie is nece&s;&s;itated to &s;ay, that it is verie &s;trange to them, that they &s;hould &s;o wrongfully and malitiou&s;ly mi&s;con&s;ter the good intention of the Netherlandi&s;h Com|pany.</P>
<P>Hath the Dutch Company with that Fleet of Ships done them the lea&s;t wrong or hinde|rance, as to what concerns their coming or departing in or from the &s;aid Havens? yea even during the time that the Netherlandi&s;h Com|panie lay with the whole Fleet before Gamron? Have not the Engli&s;h &s;ayled in and out, as they plea&s;ed? They cannot but &s;ay, yea.</P>
<P>What rea&s;on had they then to judge &s;o mali|tiou&s;ly of their de&s;ign.</P>
<P>But in the fore&s;aid Triplick it is &s;aid, that the Netherlandi&s;h Company intended indeed to &s;et on foot and effect it, in ca&s;e the Engli&s;h had not by hap appeared there with a greater num|ber of Ships, not to be hindred or forced by the Netherlanders.</P>
<P>But before they were arrived there with any number of Ships together, did not the fore&s;aid Fleet and the &s;aid Ka&s;embroot let their &s;ingle
<PB N="67" REF="33">Ships go in and out freely and unmole&s;ted, yea even their Boats and Chalops: and with them al&s;o their Ship William&s;on loden with Goods fraited for and belonging to the Per&s;ians? Sure|ly they cannot deny it.</P>
<P>And what concerns this great number of Ships, which they &s;ay they afterward had there, if compared with the number, e&s;pe|cially the greatne&s;s of the Netherlandish Ships, all mounted, mand, and in gallant equi|page for Warr, they were &s;trong enuff, had they had order, to have kept them out of Gam|ron.</P>
<P>The Netherlandish Fleet lay a year and &s;ome months before Gamron, and the Engli&s;h were but a &s;mall time with their fore&s;aid number of Ships there, whereas before and after there came other, yea &s;ingle Ships, to and fro, and yet according to their own confe&s;&s;ion no &s;top or hinderance was don to any of them, &s;ave on|ly to the Ship called the Marchant of Bengale before mentioned, and of which &s;hall be further &s;poken by and by.</P>
<P>From whence then is it evinced, that the Dutch Company had &s;uch a de&s;ign, or what proofs do they bring, to ju&s;tifie what they de|po&s;e in their fore&s;aid Reply? Not one only word.</P>
<P>But to &s;ay how the ca&s;e &s;tands, the Nether|landish Companie undertakes to &s;hew, that the &s;aid Ka&s;embroot, commanding the &s;aid Fleet in Chief in the Gulph of Per&s;ia, did all
<PB N="68" REF="34">the time of his abode there, by expre&s;s order and command, forbid, that no let or hinde|rance &s;hould in the lea&s;t be offered to the En|glish Ships in their navigation and traffick in that Kingdom.</P>
<P>And, that the Dutch Companies manage|ment might be rendred the more &s;u&s;pected and odious, they conclude thus in their Triplick, the&s;e are the meanes which the Dutch Com|panie u&s;eth, for to get great advantages upon the Indian Princes, yea have thereby con|&s;trained that great and mightie King of Per&s;ia him&s;elf to &s;ub&s;cribe &s;uch Articles, as they would, that he might have his Havens again open and free.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides that the Netherlandish Compa|nie hath not, by all tho&s;e exce&s;&s;ive charges, covenanted or acquired any greater priviledges or advantages then they alwayes formerly have had in the Kingdom, except onely a di&s;charge from taking yearly a quantity of Silk at a cer|tain price, (at lea&s;t &s;o far as concerns the la&s;t) according to the advice, which the Dutch Companie lately received concerning the &s;ame.</P>
<P>And in ca&s;e the great Princes of the Indies, and the King of Per&s;ia him&s;elf were &s;o ea&s;ily to be forced by &s;uch a Fleet as the Dutch Companie had there, we have rea&s;on to de|mand, why the English Companie did not make u&s;e of that occa&s;ion, namely when they had pre&s;ent &s;uch a Fleet as they boa&s;t of be|fore
<PB N="69" REF="34">Gamron, for to recover of the Per&s;ians payment of the Tol or Cu&s;tom of Ormus or Gamron, which they &s;ay was &s;o truely due unto them, but unju&s;tly detained by the Per|&s;ians, at lea&s;t as to the greater part thereof, and which in the year 1654. they demanded, as to the half thereof, amounting to many hundred thou&s;and gilders, of the Netherlandish Companie, to wit, of the Goods which the &s;aid Dutch Company until that time had brought and negotiated there, but was then by Committies on both parts denyed to be due to them, and they remitted to the Per&s;ians them|&s;elves, where they &s;o often importuned them by their complaints, yea even to the threatning of them, but neverthle&s;s could never obtain any &s;atisfaction: would they not in all that time, wherein the&s;e pretences have &s;ince en|crea&s;ed to &s;uch va&s;t &s;ums, if it had bin to be acquired with &s;uch facility, have u&s;ed the&s;e wayes and meanes? Undoubtedly yea.</P>
<P>And thereby we may wel judge, what was the Con&s;titution of that Fleet they had there, and of which they made &s;uch high boa&s;ts.</P>
<P>But in ca&s;e they &s;hould yet attempt the &s;ame, could the Netherlandish Company, although much prejudiced thereby in their Traffick, as undoubted would &s;o be, could they thereupon lay any action to the charge of the English Company, and make pretences upon them?</P>
<PB N="70" REF="35">
<P>Surely the Dutch Companie would wi&s;h, yea, entreat in a friendly way, that if &s;uch a thing &s;hould be, our Ships might have the like u&s;age, as the Dutch Companie did &s;hew to the English.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd complaint, namely the hin|derance occa&s;ioned to the Ship the Marchant of Bengale in her unloding, by detaining and di&s;turbing them in their Traffick and under|takings.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tands the ca&s;e: The Dutch Company, as hath been &s;aid, having War with the Per|&s;ians, or being as they &s;ay, <HI>in &s;tatu belli,</HI> and laying with their Fleet before Gamron, there came tyding from Land, that there was an intent to bord our Fleet by fire Ships, and &s;o cau&s;e us to leave the rode; whereupon we re|&s;olved to cea&s;e on all the Per&s;ian Boats we could get, and make them fa&s;t behind our Ships: the fore&s;aid English Ship laying in the mid&s;t of our Fleet, and making preparation to unlode in Per&s;ian Boats, the &s;aid Ka&s;embroot de&s;ired them to be plea&s;ed to de&s;i&s;t, and not to make u&s;e of Per&s;ian Boats, e&s;pecially they being accu&s;tomed to take in their loding in the night time to be verie earlie at land to unlode, we offring them al the Boats of our Ships to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, that we might be certain, that they under the cloack of coming to the fore&s;aid Ship, with their Fire&s;hips, and pa&s;&s;ing by our watch, might not before we were aware, fal upon us; but they of the fore&s;aid Ship re|jecting
<PB N="71" REF="35">our proffer, there came among our Fleet a Per&s;ian Boat, mand with ten or twelve Per&s;ian Rowers and one English Mariner, ha|ving by him two ca&s;es with Ro&s;ewater, which the &s;aid Ka&s;embroot cau&s;ed to be brought into his Ship: the English Interpreter pre&s;ently there|upon making his complaint, the former proffer of our Boats was renieuwed, and at his going away bid to take with him the two ca&s;es of Ro&s;ewater, which he refu&s;ing, they were put into his Boat, and &s;o he departed.</P>
<P>This being the true hi&s;torie, we demand, what herein was don ami&s;&s;e by the Dutch Com|panie, to cau&s;e the English to make &s;uch cla|morous complaints about it? Or whither if any hinderance came thereby to the English (for damage they had none) they brought it not up|on their own heads?</P>
<P>The goods they accu&s;e us to have taken out of the Per&s;ian boat (which neverthele&s;&s;e they them&s;elves confe&s;&s;e were agayn re&s;tored, and put into the boat where the Engli&s;h interpre|ter was) They aggravate, for to make them, in all apearance, to &s;eem of great impor|tance; were onely the fore&s;aid two Ca&s;es of Ro&s;ewater.</P>

<P>THe Engli&s;h Ea&s;t-Indie Companie in a Reque&s;t they pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty of Great Britain 29. June 1687. &s;ay, they have had advi&s;e by divers Ships niewly arrived, of the injuries and violences the Hollanders have exerci&s;ed again&s;t the Engli&s;h on the Coa&s;t of Cormandel, under pretext of having warr with the King of Golcondach.</P>
<P>That they made them&s;elves ma&s;ter of Met|chalapatam, after the &s;ame manner they cea&s;ed Bantam.</P>
<P>That they had prohibited the Engli&s;h eight weeks ago to Traffick there any more, al|though, they have had their re&s;idence and Ma|ga&s;in there eightie or ninetie yeares together, and that the Maga&s;in was built by the Com|pany,
<PB N="91" REF="45">and that they bought the verie ground upon which it was erected, as may be &s;een in the writing of the Governor and the Dutch Coun&s;el at Pollicats.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders in time of peace did by main force A&s;&s;ault the Fort the Engli&s;h had built at Batancapas, &s;eated on the We&s;t-Coa&s;t of Sumatra, to &s;ecure them&s;elves the better of the Traffick in Pepper; that in con|tempt they brake and tore in peeces the Pa|villion of his Britti&s;h Maje&s;ty where is was &s;et up.</P>
<P>That they there pillaged the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e it is apparent, the de&s;ign of the Hollanders is to appropriate to them&s;elves by violence, inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion the whole Trade of the Ea&s;t-Indies, The &s;aid Companie hopeth that his Maje&s;tie with the fir&s;t will applie &s;uch remedies, as may prae|vent the continual inva&s;ions of the Hollan|ders.</P>
<P>A Letter of the Holland Companie from Pollicat, written the 13. Augu&s;t 1686. St. N. to Mr. William Gifford, Prae&s;ident of the Engli&s;h Companie, and to his Coun&s;el at the Fort St. George.</P>
<P>It containes in &s;ub&s;tance, that the &s;aid Hol|landi&s;h Companie hath bin evil treated, &s;ome years &s;ince, beyond the Coa&s;t of Cormandel, as al&s;o the North Coa&s;t from Onixa, unto Met|chopotam, by the Mini&s;ters of State, and the Governors of the King of Gulcondach.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="46">
<P>That they often required ju&s;tice, but to no purpo&s;e, and for to revenge them&s;elves of the&s;e injuries, they had &s;ea&s;ed Metchopotem 16. July. That for a marck of the Friend&s;hip they de&s;ire to maintain with the Engli&s;h Company, they permit them, to embarck in their own Ships out of their Maga&s;ins at Metchepotam the effects the English had there, as al&s;o to take out in Barcks all the Provi&s;ions and all the Marchandi&s;es which &s;hall com in their Ships to Metchopotam for to put them into their Maga&s;ins, yet upon condition that they &s;hall carrie none out of the Citie of Metchopotam, to &s;ell them to Marchants, or to the Sub|jects of the King of Gulcondagh, until the &s;aid Company &s;hall have &s;atisfactions.</P>
<P>The &s;ooner to obtain this &s;atisfaction they had re&s;olved not only to hold the mean while the &s;aid Citie in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o to pre|vent that the English &s;hould not &s;uffer any da|mage during the&s;e troubles, they though it fit to adverti&s;e them to bring into their Ma|ga&s;ins the effects they had in the Countrie, and that within the &s;pace of 6. or 8. weeks, recko|ning from the time the Companie had &s;ea&s;ed the &s;aid City.</P>
<P>That they will al&s;o have, that the English Company adverti&s;e theirs of all what they shall cau&s;e to be brought in, to the end that by the good order they &s;hall hold, the incon|veniences may be prevented, which otherwi&s;e might befal the English.</P>

<P>An&s;wer of Mr. William Gifford Prae&s;ident, and of the Councel of the English Company, dated .... 1686. written to the Hollands Company at Pollicat. It being in &s;ub&s;tance: That the English Company are not ignorant of the de&s;ign the Dutch Company now hath in making them&s;elves Ma&s;ters in Metchapo|tam.</P>
<P>That they could wish that the ruinating of the English Commerce were not the main end, the Hollanders now a long time had practi&s;ed the&s;e tricks: Particularly at Bantam and &s;ince at Chimatra, but that the Hollanders were as yet to be re&s;pon&s;able unto them.</P>
<P>That they have remarqued that the Hollan|ders in all their Treaties they make with the Indian Kings and Princes, have endeavoured to exclude their Companie from Traffick in their Countries and Ports.</P>
<P>That this de&s;ign is now di&s;covered and re|&s;ented in Europe, that their pre&s;umption is to great to impo&s;er Lawes to the English in &s;uch a manner, that now, &s;ince they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of Metchapotam they will have the English to comport them&s;elves as to their commerce there, according to their plea&s;urre: But the English are not obliged to follow their order, That the Hou&s;e and the ground upon which their Maga&s;in is built is an heritage acquired by their own money.</P>
<P>That upon the&s;e grounds they coun&s;el them to act with di&s;cretion and agreeing to ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>Mr. Pots remits them to a certain Paper of 26. July to be informed of the cau&s;e of his voyage to Batancapas, and why he took with him &s;o much of the Companies effects.</P>
<P>He gives rea&s;ons, why he did not wayt for orders or command, before he undertook the voyage, that it was, becau&s;e the two Sons of the Emperor and the Mandarins, had ex|treamly pre&s;&s;ed him to ha&s;ten the voyage, as much as could be, le&s;t the Hollanders being adverti&s;ed of the de&s;ign of the English, &s;hould &s;ettle them&s;elves there before, and &s;o the En|glish be fru&s;trated of their entrepri&s;e.</P>
<P>He departed, as he &s;aith, from Indraponna 16. July, taking with him forty men Dome|&s;ticks and Soldiers, going with them to Paga|&s;on, to meet there the two Sons of the Empe|ror Manuncabbo, who wayted them to go together to Batancapas, being in all 2000.
<PB N="95" REF="47">there to &s;ettle the Engli&s;h. That after 5 dayes voyage they arrived with the Emperor and the two Princes: and that the Emperor had bid the Engli&s;h to &s;ettle them&s;elves there.</P>
<P>That three dayes before they arrived the Hollanders had &s;ettled and fortified them|&s;elves there upon a Rock on the other &s;ide of the river, notwith&s;tanding that the Emperor and the Mandarins had commanded them to re|tire, telling them that he had given the Coun|trey to the King of Great Brittain to &s;et the Engli&s;h Companie there; and that he had ne|ver given permi&s;&s;ion to the Dutch to re|&s;ide there.</P>
<P>That the &s;ame day of his arriving at Ba|tancapas the Hollanders had &s;ent him a Pro|te&s;t, coun&s;elling him to take good heed of the Malayans, becau&s;e they complayned that the Engli&s;h had wronged them by &s;etling at Bancola and at Indraponna, places which, they &s;ayd, had formerly bin given unto them.</P>
<P>That at the end of two dayes he &s;ent them another Prote&s;t.</P>
<P>That the day after his arriving, the Em|peror and his two &s;ons arrived, and them|&s;elves planted the Pavillion of the King of England.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders had fortifyed them|&s;elves, as much as they could.</P>
<P>That during the 3 fir&s;t weeks there was no oppo&s;ition of the one or other part, al|though the Engli&s;h did often pre&s;&s;e the Mal|layans
<PB N="96" REF="48">to fall upon the English.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders &s;eeing that after all their per&s;wa&s;ions, the Mallayans would do nothing, forced them to retire further up into the Countrie, about three miles towards the North, with de&s;ign (as the Emperor and his men believed) to wa&s;t the Countrie, the Hou|&s;es, and e&s;pecially the City of Batancapas.</P>
<P>That to prevent this de&s;olation the Emperor and his two Sons had drawn back their forces, except 60. or 70. Mallayans, whom they left there for to cover the works.</P>
<P>That after the retreat of the&s;e Troopes the the Hollanders in Batancapas the day after beeing the 23. Augu&s;t on a Friday and on the Sunday had &s;hot with their greate&s;t Canons at the people as they came to the Market in hope to make them afraid, and no more to &s;upply the English, or to bring them any more provi|&s;ions.</P>
<P>That a Canon-bullet with two points &s;triking a tree neer the Palli&s;ado of the English Fort, bur&s;t a&s;under in two pieces.</P>
<P>That the day after they had di&s;patched Mr. Samuel Worly to the Hollanders to know of them the rea&s;on wherefore they had &s;hot at the Maga&s;in of the Engli&s;h and their men, and to tel their commander they would &s;end a peece of the Bullet of the King of England, and in|form him of the affront they had don to his Subjects, but the Commander not being then pre&s;ent Mr. Worly had don the me&s;&s;age to an|other
<PB N="97" REF="48">Gentleman that had the command in the ab&s;ence of the other, the &s;aid Officer &s;hould have an&s;wered that he much wondred they &s;hould make &s;uch a work of one or two Ca|mon &s;hot, and pointing with his finger to divers Peeces not far off from him, &s;hould have &s;aid, behold there a great many, which &s;hall be &s;hot of, and not fayling of his word, the &s;ame afternoon 21. Augu&s;t he made two &s;hot more, after the &s;ame manner as before.</P>
<P>That the Mallayans being affrighted, the greater part which remained with the Engli&s;h, de&s;erted them.</P>
<P>That the Hollanders being adverti&s;ed hereof, embarqued in their Chalops the Mallayans with a number of Dutch Soldiers.</P>
<P>That they fired continally their great Guns while they were in their Barqs, and at length having &s;et foot on land, they with furie a&s;&s;aulted the &s;mall number of Mallayans, which were for the Engli&s;h, &s;et on fire their Palli&s;ado, and having put to flight the &s;aid Mallayans, they fell upon the Engli&s;h which were at the En|trance of the Palli&s;ado.</P>
<P>That a certain man named Mackolon, an Officer of the Hollanders, told him, that except he &s;ought to e&s;cape, the Mallayans would kill him.</P>
<P>That not fearing their threats, the Holland|ders had commanded the Mallayans to a&s;&s;ault the Engli&s;h, but the Mallayans te&s;tifying their
<PB N="98" REF="49">di&s;like by refu&s;ing to do it, the En&s;ign-bearer &s;et him&s;elf in the front, forced an entrance in|to the Fort, being followed of &s;ome Mallayans and about 40. Hollanders.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Troopes were no &s;ooner pa&s;t the Palli&s;&s;ado, but they &s;aid to them and the other Engli&s;h, that if ever they entred more into the Fort, they might expect nothing el&s;e, but to be fallen upon.</P>
<P>That at the verie &s;ame in&s;tant the Dutch Soldiers and the Mallayans began to plunder, car|rying away all they thought was of any worth, and gave it into the hands of their Comman|ders, and while they were thus pillaging, the Dutch Soldiers in contempt, brake and tare in pieces the Flag of the King of England, which was &s;et up there.</P>
<P>That after all the&s;e Violences the fore&s;aid Officer by order of the Commander, prayd him to retire on the &s;ide of the Hollanders, pro|mi&s;ing in the name of the Commander, they would re&s;tore the Marchandi&s;e, Effects, Silver-work, Canon and all what might appertain to the Engli&s;h, and what &s;hould be found in the hands of the Mallayans.</P>
<P>That he thereupon going to the Comman|der named Mackabon: he in&s;tead of performing what was promi&s;ed, an&s;wered him, he could do nothing in it, and that what the Mallayans had taken, was ju&s;tly acquired, and they could not be con&s;trained to render the &s;ame: however

<P>But coming again to him, after he had ordered men and a boat to take in the Canon, there came &s;ome of his men and &s;aid, that in ca&s;e we would have the Canon, the Mallayans pretended to have 500 dollars for them.</P>

<P>THe Chamber of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indie Company</HI> of Am&s;terdam, hath after the A&s;&s;embling of the <HI>Seventien</HI> repre&s;enting the &s;aid Com|pany, and brought your pui&s;&s;ant Highne&s;&s;es Letter, with the annexed Re&s;olution, both being of the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t now pa&s;t, con|taining an In&s;ertion of the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> Envoy Extraordinary of his Royal Maje&s;ty of Great <HI>Brittain,</HI> pre|&s;ented unto your Pui&s;: Highne&s;&s;es, with an Annex; the &s;aid <HI>Memorial</HI> containing com|plaints again&s;t the doing and tran&s;actions of the Mini&s;ters of our Company at <HI>Ma&s;lupat|nam,</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> and at <HI>Ba|tancapas,</HI> upon the We&s;t-Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> with demand of reparation for the Infractions and dammages, which the Subjects of his &s;aid Roya<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> Maje&s;ty &s;hould have &s;uffered at both tho&s;e places: and concerning which your Pui&s;&s;: Highne&s;&s;es were plea&s;ed to command us to bring in our Information: and by rea&s;on
<PB N="2" REF="53">the &s;aid Chamber could at that time give only a provi&s;ional An&s;wer, dated the 7. of Augu&s;t, becau&s;e the Ships by which we expected our Letters of Advice from the <HI>Indies,</HI> concerning the&s;e Affaires, were not as yet arrived. The la&s;t whereof, to which we were then nece&s;&s;i|tated to refer our &s;elves, being by Gods good providence &s;ome dayes &s;ince &s;afely come unto us, and that thereby we now are in a capacity to inform your Pui&s;&s;: Highne&s;&s;es more pun|ctually, we will with permi&s;&s;ion further &s;ay, that we find the fore&s;aid complaints to be two|fold: Fir&s;t, over the evil proceeding and con|duct of our men at <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> and &s;econdly at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> where we, as they &s;ay, continu|ally have exerci&s;ed inju&s;tice and violence a|gain&s;t them.</P>
<P>What concerns the fir&s;t, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to dive &s;omewhat more groundedly into that bu&s;ine&s;s, viz. After the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> had &s;u&s;tained and born many injuries, dam|mages, and violences by the King of <HI>Golcon|da,</HI> who was mi&s;led by his Chief Mini&s;ters, till at la&s;t the whole Traffick of the &s;aid Company in all the Northern Factories and Lodges was forbidden, and it was commanded to all the Regents and Officers, to deprive all the Factories and Mini&s;ter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hereof of all meanes of livelihood, and fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">er that no wever nor handicrafts men &s;hould thence|forward deliver any thing of what they had underhand unto them, all which was direct|ly
<PB N="3" REF="53">contrary to the Octroy and Patents granted unto the &s;aid Company. That at la&s;t we jud|ged it rea&s;onable to have recour&s;e to force and con&s;traint, hoping thereby if po&s;&s;ible to bring the King to better and more moderate thoughts, but before we would enter upon it, we though it be&s;t in an orderly way, to make our intent known to the King, who is judged by all to be a Prince of a good nature, and al|ways hath &s;hewn him&s;elf affectioned to the <HI>Ne|therlandish Company,</HI> and the rather becau&s;e the Government of <HI>Batavia,</HI> were fully a&s;&s;ured that the&s;e Infractions and Troubles were oc|ca&s;ioned to our Company only by the evilaf|fection and ill will of <HI>Madolena</HI> and <HI>Achena,</HI> the two Chief <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of that Kingdom, who had &s;o remarkably injured the &s;aid Com|pany, and invented a way to incite their King again&s;t us, without any right information how the ca&s;e &s;tood betwixt him and us, which &s;aid <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> a while after by rea&s;on of in|ward commotions occa&s;ioned by their ill ma|nagement of Affairs came to a mo&s;t mi&s;erable End. However the &s;aid Government of <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> to the end aforementioned &s;ent a <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;arie</HI> with full Commi&s;&s;ion and Power to treat with the King, and if it might be to compo&s;e all things in a way of amitie: But our <HI>Commi&s;sary</HI> was &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful, that the King either could or would not a&s;&s;ent to what we judged to be right and equal, in &s;o much that to acquire the fore&s;aid reparation and
<PB N="4" REF="54">&s;atisfaction, we were nece&s;&s;itated by force of Arms, to a&s;&s;ure and make our &s;elves Ma&s;ter of <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> in hope thereby to induce the King the &s;ooner to li&s;ten to an accom|modation, which al&s;o the 16. of July 1686. was effected without blood &s;hed, and the Kings Militia was cau&s;ed to depart, where|upon we fortifyed the City again&s;t any inva|&s;ion which might happen. And becau&s;e the <HI>English Company</HI> had a <HI>Factory</HI> and a <HI>Lodge</HI> there for their Commerce and Traffick, we by Letters in Augu&s;t following, let them or their <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> know, that however we had the Power and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City in our hands, our intention was not in the lea&s;t to hinder or incommodate their Traffick, and that they might con&s;equentially di&s;po&s;e of, and lade their goods they had or could make ready in their Ships, together with all their Provi&s;ion and Marchandi&s;es, which might by Sea be brought unto them, and take it in|to their Lodge, only that they &s;hould not di&s;po&s;e of them to the Subjects of that King, nor after the expiration of &s;ix or eight weeks &s;uffer any goods more to be brought to them out of the Country.</P>
<P>This being thus pa&s;&s;ed, and we perceiving that the Enemy began to &s;tirr, and to ca&s;t up works to be&s;iege us, and gather an Army thereby to deprive us of our water and other means of Livelihood, we &s;ent out our men again&s;t them, and with &s;ucce&s;s rai&s;ed the
<PB N="5" REF="54">Kings forces by driving them out of their Tents: and forasmuch as the Enemy had threatned and intended to burn the City, which was all built of Combu&s;tible matter, thereupon the <HI>English,</HI> with diver&s;e others of the Inhabitants for fear of being con&s;umed by fire, retired upward into the Country, but the King &s;oon after re&s;olving to come to a treatie of accomodation with us, which al&s;o was at length effected, by the promi&s;ing repara|tion of our Dammages, and that for the future they &s;hould no more deal thus unju&s;tly with us, but &s;uffer us to enjoy free trading as formerly; all which being agreed unto, we withdrew our Militia out the City, and gave it up again into the hands of the King.</P>
<P>This being the true &s;tate of the matter, hereupon the <HI>English</HI> Company makes com|plaints by an Annex, to which the Memorial of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville</HI> hath relation, over Injuries and Violences offered them at <HI>Ma|&s;lupatnam,</HI> under the pretext of a War, which the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> had under|taken again&s;t the King of <HI>Golconda:</HI> but they &s;ay they are well acquainted with &s;uch Tricks and De&s;igns. And that we made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> after the &s;ame man|ner we before haddon of <HI>Bantam,</HI> to no other end then thereby to ruinate and deprive the En|gli&s;h of their Traffick.</P>
<P>That we had play'd &s;uch prancks to often, e&s;pecially at <HI>Bantam,</HI> and afterward at <HI>Suma|tra,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="55">however they doubted not but we &s;hould be re&s;pon&s;able for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>That we forbade them after the Expiration of eight weeks to trade any more at <HI>Ma&s;lu|patnam,</HI> notwith&s;tanding they there have had their place of Re&s;idence and Maga&s;in above eighty or ninety years together, and had built the &s;ame at their expences upon ground bought with their own money.</P>
<P>That in all the Treaties we have made with the Kings and Princes of tho&s;e Countries, we always endeavoured to exclude their Com|pany from the Trade and Havens of tho&s;e places, thereby wholy to annihilate their Commerce, but that notwith&s;tanding the fore&s;aid In&s;inuation they did intend to keep up their trading at <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam.</HI></P>
<P>Truly here is a wonderful kind of Lan|guage, and by it may be perceived, how ea&s;y it is to Mi&s;con&s;ter a &s;incere and upright inten|tion, and wre&s;t it to a bad &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The que&s;tions then naturally flowing from hence are the&s;e, viz.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Whether our Company did undertake this War out of an evil intention and de&s;ire, under that pretext to offer injury and violence to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Whether it be true, that our De&s;ign was to make our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> after the &s;ame manner as we had don of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and with no other end and intention than thereby to effect the ruine
<PB N="7" REF="55">of the Commerce of the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Whether it be true, that we had forbode them their Traffick at <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> after the expiring of eight weeks.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whether it then were, or yet is in the power of the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> to enter into &s;uch Leagues and Contracts with the Princes of tho&s;e Countries, by which other Nations &s;hould be &s;ecluded from trading in any of the Wares or Fruits growing in tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>What concerns the fir&s;t, it is known to all, that the <HI>Ea&s;t Indie Company</HI> of the&s;e Lands, is the only erected Companie of Commerce for to enjoy by and thro an hone&s;t trading in Countries &s;o far remote from us, the profits which we hoped might thence en&s;ue.</P>
<P>But forasmuch as we found by &s;ad expe|rience, that we &s;hould have to doe with Na|tions which were not to be too much tru&s;ted, and had evilly entreated many of our Traders, yea, murdered &s;ome of them, which before an Octroy was granted, had negotiated with them, it &s;eemed good to the <HI>States</HI> of our Country, to prevent &s;uch mi&s;chiefs, to qua|lify and Authori&s;e by a granted Octroy to this <HI>Company,</HI> to procure reparation by all &s;uch meanes as &s;hould be judged mo&s;t conve|nient by them, with further Authority to make Leagues and Contracts with the <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Potentates</HI> of tho&s;e Nations, and to erect and build Forts and Ca&s;tles as might &s;erve for their &s;ecurity.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="56">
<P>The&s;e Wars then were not to be under|taken, but only in ca&s;e of urgent nece&s;&s;ity, af|ter all wayes of Accommodation and con|de&s;cention had in vain been attempted.</P>
<P>It is a thing that &s;peaks of it &s;elf, that be|tween Marchandi&s;ing and War there is no a|greement, and that Merchants can no wi&s;e have any intere&s;t thereby, and the <HI>Companie</HI> therefore had preci&s;e Orders to &s;hun it as much as po&s;&s;ibly might be.</P>
<P>So that it is mo&s;t ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Company</HI> &s;hould have engaged in that War again&s;t the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> &s;o potent a Prince, and only out of a jollitie of &s;pirit, A War which we knew aforehand, that be|&s;ides the ce&s;&s;ation of Traffick, would draw after it &s;uch charges and lo&s;&s;es, without any expectation (&s;ave only hopes of reparation and dammages &s;u&s;tained) the verie lea&s;t pro|fit imaginable, muchle&s;s, that our main aim &s;hould have been to incommodate the <HI>En|glish,</HI> or eau&s;e other Dammage to accrue to them. Certainly the &s;aid <HI>Netherlandish Com|pany</HI> ought not to be lookt upon &s;o void of all &s;en&s;e as to ca&s;t them&s;elves upon &s;uch heavie charges and troubles by a War, the i&s;&s;ue of which is uncertain, and that only to incommodate and cau&s;e &s;ome lo&s;s to a <HI>third partie,</HI> whereas the charges and hinderance to their own Commerce would be of more importance an hundred fold, then the Dam|mage of that <HI>third partie</HI> could amount to.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="56">
<P>And be&s;ides what hath the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> further and more in&s;i&s;ted upon or obtained, then the continuance of their former Commerce, according as it was granted un|to them by Octroy, or, as they call it in tho&s;e Countreys, by <HI>Firman?</HI></P>
<P>Have they made any Contracts with the King to the prejudice or dammage of the <HI>English Company?</HI> Not in the lea&s;t: What a|greement or compari&s;on then is there between this bu&s;ine&s;s and <HI>Bantam?</HI> In <HI>Bantam</HI> the <HI>Ne|therlandish Company</HI> was Auxiliary to Succour an oppre&s;&s;ed King, who&s;e condition and &s;tate was brought to the very point of utter ruine, and who in this de&s;perate juncture im|plored our Auxiliary Forces again&s;t his Re|bels, and by who&s;e means he was delivered from that oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>For which the King granted, or rather, we bargained and required nothing el&s;e, but the Trade in his City and Country, with Se|clu&s;ion of all other, not to continue alwayes, but only &s;o long till the promi&s;e made of reim|bour&s;ing the charges we had been at in af|fording our help to him, and which by mu|tual con&s;ent was &s;ummed up, &s;hould be per|formed.</P>
<P>This al&s;o may &s;erve to demon&s;trate the Mo|deration of the <HI>Netherlandish Companie,</HI> in re|gard of the intere&s;t of the <HI>English Companie.</HI> True the Troopes of the <HI>Netherlandish Com|pany</HI> are &s;till in <HI>Bantam;</HI> but hath not the
<PB N="10" REF="57">King power to this? May he not retain them in his City for his &s;ervice and the &s;ecurity of his Per&s;on and State, and without whom he could not, as he declareth, &s;ub&s;i&s;t or be &s;e|cure among his Subjects, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that had been up in Rebellion again&s;t him, of whom he was not much beloved, and al&s;o the Old King his Father, being yet alive.</P>
<P>By this al&s;o an An&s;wer is &s;ufficiently made unto the &s;econd Point, with this Addition only, that it is very rediculous to think, that the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> &s;hould have intended by this War agan&s;t <HI>Golconda;</HI> to plot the over|throw and ruin of the <HI>English Companies</HI> Commerce (which notwith&s;tanding they ma|litiou&s;ly lay to our charge) as by the event al&s;o hath clearly appeared.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e, as before hath been &s;aid, we fore&s;aw that the Erecting of the <HI>Netherlan|dish Company</HI> in the <HI>Indies,</HI> could not be maintained without force of Armes, therefore, as has been &s;aid, the <HI>States</HI> did in a &s;pecial man|ner authori&s;e them thereto.</P>
<P>Whereupon the <HI>English Company</HI> percei|ving they were deprived of &s;uch a power, did in imitation, of what the <HI>States</HI> had granted to us, al&s;o procure an <HI>Octroy</HI> or <HI>Charter</HI> from the King now reigning, of which till that time they were unprovided, and by rea&s;on of which, were fain to &s;uffer tho&s;e injuries and Violences patiently, which now the one and then another of the Princes, Potentates, and
<PB N="11" REF="57">Nations mole&s;ted them with, and &s;till mu&s;t have &s;uffered, had they not by &s;pecial Autho|rity been impowred to an offen&s;ive War in &s;uch ca&s;e as might fall out. And therefore as &s;oon as they had obtained that Charter, they by virtue thereof took up Arms again&s;t the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> in <HI>Bengale,</HI> and as is thought al&s;o in <HI>Suratte.</HI></P>
<P>And might not now the <HI>Dutch Companie</HI> with as good ground and rea&s;on affirm, that the <HI>English Company</HI> hath undertaken this War, thereby to incommodate, endammage and enterrupt us in our Trading, which is ve|ry con&s;iderable in tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>And in ca&s;e we &s;hould make complaints a|gain&s;t them, would they de&s;i&s;t, or be per|&s;waded to make no further Progre&s;s in their Affairs? Undoubtly they would not. Or if we &s;hould hereupon become trouble&s;om to them, might they not ju&s;tly help them&s;elves with the known Rule, <HI>that he who u&s;eth his own Right, doth hurt no man thereby.</HI> Yet thus <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> doth blind the Eyes of men.</P>
<P>We only wi&s;h and de&s;ire, that in &s;uch ca&s;es of their Warr, which they wage, our <HI>Dutch Company</HI> may be treated, and have the &s;ame mea&s;ure as the <HI>English Company</HI> hath had, all the while the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> made War with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Golconda.</HI></P>
<P>The third Point, &s;o as it is couched and laid down in the <HI>Annex</HI> of the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the
<PB N="12" REF="58">Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> is altogether abu&s;ive and untrue, to wit, That we had forbidden them after the expiring of eight weekes to negotiate there any more.</P>
<P>True, we under&s;tood it fit, and &s;o forbade them that after the expiration of eight weekes, they &s;hould bring no more Wares which they might have be&s;poken, from the Countrie in|to the City, for if they would, they had op|portunities enough to bring in all they had du|ring this time.</P>
<P>But here the que&s;ion may be: Whether in this we have not don ami&s;s and contrary to <HI>Right of Nations?</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, by Sea we hindred them not, but out of our own goodwill, although we had a Squadron of Ships before the City, permitted them freely to traffick; yea they might du|ring the &s;pace of the&s;e eight weeks, cau&s;e all what they had in the Country to be brought unto them. Now in &s;tead that they ought to have taken and owned this as a great Civilitie conde&s;cention and benefit to them, this they make a point or Article of their complaint and accu&s;ation, but with as little ground, as in all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>It is well known, that when the <HI>French, English, Spaniard, Portugi&s;es</HI> and others, make Conque&s;ts of any Countries or Places beyond <HI>Europe,</HI> they then forbid Navigation and Traf|fick unto all Strangers in the &s;aid placcs.</P>
<P>Yea &s;o far that &s;ome of them, if they only
<PB N="13" REF="58">&s;pie at Sea a &s;trange &s;hip though at &s;ome di|&s;tance, &s;eemingly approching their Countries, they bord, take and confi&s;cate them.</P>
<P>In conformity and according to this practi&s;e the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> after they were becom ma&s;ters of <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> might have forbidden the <HI>Navigation</HI> and all Commerce unto the <HI>English Company.</HI></P>
<P>For altho the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> made u&s;e and tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the City, to no other End, then only to bring the King of <HI>Golconda</HI> the &s;ooner to rea&s;onable termes; yet they could not be certain, whether it &s;hould have &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s as they expected, or how long it might be before it were effected.</P>
<P>And in the mean while, why might they not order them&s;elves according to the <HI>Rule</HI> of other Nations, and e&s;pecially that which the <HI>En|glish</HI> them&s;elves beyond <HI>Europe</HI> doe practi&s;e; yea which the <HI>English Company</HI> doth do in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> al&s;o, as &s;hall more largely by and by be dilated.</P>
<P>How then can it be ill taken or imputed an Injurie don by the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> that they only required, that the <HI>English Company,</HI> after the expiration of eight weekes, &s;hould let no more Wares of the Country, to be brought into the City, or to hold corre&s;pondence with the Enemies of the <HI>Netherlandish Company.</HI></P>
<P>For if all what was carried out, and brought in into the City, &s;hould have been at the plea|&s;ure of the <HI>English Company,</HI> while the Ene|my
<PB N="14" REF="59">lay po&s;ted with his Army round about the &s;ame, it would certainly have been of too dangerous a con&s;equence to the <HI>Netherlandish Company.</HI></P>
<P>They might therefore during the time the City was in their power, in matters of &s;uch a nature, order and di&s;po&s;e of things, as they judged mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>Neither can any ju&s;tly interpret this in an evil &s;en&s;e, although it had been don here in <HI>Eu|rope:</HI> Namely to forbid that in a City &s;urroun|ded and be&s;ieged by Land, nothing be brought in and out, and that thro the Army of the E|nemy, who undoubtedly neither could nor would permit the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But put the ca&s;e that it might in &s;ome re&s;pect be controverted and di&s;puted (which certainly in rea&s;on can not be imagined) yet then it ought to be enquired into, whether by that Letter or In&s;inuation any dammage did accrue unto them.</P>
<P>For, as before hath been &s;aid, the <HI>English</HI> did of their own accord retire out of <HI>Ma&s;lu|patnam,</HI> leaving the City for fear of being burnt by fire.</P>
<P>And again, they do not &s;ay, that any &s;top or hinderance was done to them in their Com|merce: for on the contrary in their An&s;wer un|to the In&s;inuation (as may be &s;een in the fore|&s;aid Annex to the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville</HI>) they affirm that they would con|tinue their Traffick as before.</P>

<P>And forasmuch as they could there receive Wares out of that Kingdom as well as out of <HI>Ma&s;lupatnam,</HI> hence it manife&s;tly appeareth that the &s;u&s;pition which the <HI>English Company</HI> would blot us with, as if we had remarkablie injured them in their Traffick in the King|dom of <HI>Golconda,</HI> is altogether ungrounded and frivolous.</P>

<P>It is thus, the fore&s;aid Coa&s;t is divided into divers Regions and Juri&s;dictions, of which <HI>Bon|coulo, Sillebaer,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>South,</HI> far beyond the Straites of <HI>Sunda,</HI> do belong to the King of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and again from <HI>Boncoule Northwards</HI> unto <HI>Sinckal,</HI> are under the Command of the <HI>Netherlandish Company.</HI> The Prince and People of the&s;e Countries were in part &s;ubjected to the <HI>Netherlndish Company,</HI> for and in acknowledgment of the Benefits they had received from us, being to our va&s;t expences and trouble, freed from oppre&s;&s;ion, and having our promi&s;e to take them into our protection.</P>
<P>And partly by the War the&s;e mutinous and unfaithful people waged again&s;t us, for thereby beeing &s;ubdued and brought under our power, they were forced not only to acknowledg that Soverainity we had, but al&s;o by Contract to oblige them&s;elves to deliver unto us at a cer|tain rate all the Pepper and other commodities their Countries yielded with excluding of all other Nations, not only <HI>Indians,</HI> but <HI>Europians</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>And what concerns <HI>Boncoulo,</HI> it is true the <HI>English</HI> &s;ome years pa&s;t, came with their Forces, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;clves thereof, un|der pretext that the Old King of <HI>Bantam</HI> had during the Civil Wars (in which he was ta|ken Pri&s;oner) granted to them free Trading, and Habitation at <HI>Sillebaer,</HI> but were driven out of the la&s;t place by the forces of the King
<PB N="17" REF="60">that now reigneth in <HI>Bantam,</HI> they retired to <HI>Boucoulo,</HI> and built a Fortre&s;&s;e there, where they yet keep their abode, and from thence did tran&s;port and wre&s;t out of our hands a verie con&s;iderable part of Pepper, we &s;ay, wre&s;ted, forasmuch as it was by Contract with <HI>Bantam</HI> made over to us, whereby although they have intruded into what belonged to us, to our great detriment; yet we will pa&s;s that by, as not being ignorant that &s;uch manner of Contracts and Obligations made with Princes in who&s;e Countries, where we have only Lodges or Factories, doe give us no ful right actually to hinder other Nations for to buy and tran&s;port their Commodities, but mu&s;t leave it to the di&s;po&s;al of him that is Lord and Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Countries.</P>

<P>For the <HI>English</HI> as hath been &s;aid, did not on|ly not content them&s;elves to &s;ettle at <HI>Boucoulo,</HI> the Territory of <HI>Bantam,</HI> and build a Fortre&s;&s;e there, but did advance even to <HI>Indraporina,</HI> took po&s;t, and erected a Fort there al&s;o, and this they did, notwith&s;tanding the Prote&s;ta|tions
<PB N="18" REF="61">and friendly Informations of the <HI>Ne|therlandish Company</HI> again&s;t it, as infringing their right, in a Country in &s;ubjection for many yeares unto the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> and where they, be&s;ides the Contracts made with the People, doe exerci&s;e all Acts of Soverain|ty, and of which they have the Agreements and Contracts, lying by them to &s;hew. Now this is it, for which the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> doth judge they have rea&s;on &s;o greatlie to com|plain, of which by and by we &s;hall more fully &s;peak.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame nature is that of <HI>Batancapas,</HI> of which in &s;pecial mention is made in the fore&s;aid <HI>Memorial</HI> and <HI>Annex,</HI> lying be|tween <HI>Indraporina</HI> and <HI>Sullida,</HI> neer about three or four Miles from the la&s;t place men|tioned, properly appertaining to this Com|pany, where they of the <HI>English Company</HI> do them&s;elves pretend, that by or over again&s;t our Fort afore&s;aid, they al&s;o erected one, but were prevented by us, and over which prevention they make heavie complaints in their &s;aid <HI>Annex,</HI> but without any ground at all, as &s;hall appear by what followeth.</P>
<P>The Hi&s;torie, according as things were tran&s;acted, is this: After that <HI>Sapoele Boa|hand&s;laers,</HI> unto whom <HI>Batancapas</HI> al&s;o was be|longing, being a perfidious and mutinous people, had divers times before, and now a|gain of late lift up them&s;elves again&s;t the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> breaking the fidelity
<PB N="19" REF="61">they had &s;worn, and the Contracts they had made with them; yet the <HI>Dutch Com|pany</HI> upon their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and laying down their <HI>Arms</HI> in March 1686. did again receive them into favour, making a &s;trickter Contract with them, and that for the future they would, according to promi&s;e, remain in their fidelity, Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> and hence|forward re&s;pect and obey the Governour at <HI>Badang,</HI> being the chief place of the &s;aid Company on the &s;aid We&s;t-coa&s;t, without ever declining, upon pain of being declared Ene|mies, and brought under the everla&s;ting wrath of God over them and their po&s;terity; and be|&s;ides with this condition, that all the Gold, Pepper and other Wares their Countries yielded, or which were brought thither, &s;hould only be and remain for the <HI>Nether|landish Company,</HI> they paying the ordinary price for them, as by the fore&s;aid Contract in the keeping of the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> is more at large to be &s;een, which was agreed on 15. March 1686. being many Months before the <HI>English Company,</HI> according their own con|fe&s;&s;ion, came to <HI>Batancapas.</HI> And no &s;ooner were they come thither but endeavoured to mi&s;lead the people of <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and to draw them from their Fidelity and Obedi|ence; but wel knowing what kind of People they were and how little to be tru&s;ted, they erected a Fortre&s;&s;e in their Land, but
<PB N="20" REF="62">were by the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> accord|ing to their own &s;aying, prevented by build|ing a Fort there al&s;o.</P>
<P>While things were in this &s;tate, it hap|pened that &s;ome of the Nadias that were fallen of with their men, did in the pre&s;ence of &s;ix Engli&s;h, as Enemies, &s;et upon us in the fore&s;aid Po&s;t, and drive our men a Canon|&s;hot out of the Fort among the Inhabitants, by which, as was reported, four of the fore|&s;aid Inlanders were &s;lain: but as in &s;uch times and ca&s;es of that nature, all are not alike mu|tinous and of the &s;ame mind, thereupon they who remained faithful, went out again&s;t them that were fallen off, to drive them from thence, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Engli&s;h Fort, and except it had been for our intervention, they would have murthered all the Engli&s;h in their retrait: but whatever they left behind, as they de&s;ired by their Let|ter, was as much as po&s;&s;ibly could be, not only re&s;tored to them, but what is more, at their Reque&s;t we provided them all manner of provi&s;ions of meat and drinck, &amp;c. for which al&s;o in their Letters dated the 22. and 26. Au|gu&s;t 1686. they were very thankful unto us, as we can &s;hew by them, in the la&s;t of which Letters one of their men wrote, that he was come there, to wit to <HI>Batancapas,</HI> with or|der to &s;ee whether <HI>(Note this well)</HI> he could have the Canon pieces, which the <HI>Malayers</HI> in the A&s;&s;ault had found in the Fort, to be re|&s;tored
<PB N="21" REF="62">to him; but &s;eeing that they demanded too much money for them, he would go back to <HI>Indraponra,</HI> and make report thereof to the Commander in Chief: In which it is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that in the fore&s;aid <HI>Annex,</HI> belonging to the forementioned <HI>Me|morial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> they &s;ay, that the &s;ame day they came to <HI>Bantam,</HI> our <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;ent them a <HI>Prote&s;t,</HI> and withall coun&s;elled them to beware of the Malayers, with a Complaint (the&s;e are their own words) of the Injurie the Engli&s;h did to us, namely, in that they came to &s;ettle them&s;elves at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and at <HI>Indraponra</HI> al&s;o, places both appertaining to the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> and that two dayes after our men had &s;ent ano|ther Prote&s;t.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e then &s;tanding thus actually as is &s;aid, the que&s;tion will be, from which of the two Companies, the <HI>English</HI> or the <HI>Dutch,</HI> the Action doth ari&s;e, and which of the two hath cau&s;e to complaine?</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> had ac|cording to their expectation, received in their Ships, that la&s;t arrived out of the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies,</HI> all the particulars and Informations be|longing to this matter, they would not have fayled to make their ju&s;t complaints to your Pui&s;&s;: Highne&s;&s;es in a Methodical way; but forasmuch as the Letters of the Government of <HI>Batavia</HI> &s;pecifie, that they mu&s;t fir&s;t wait for the Arriral of their Ships from the We&s;t-Coa&s;t,
<PB N="22" REF="63">the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> mu&s;t de|fer the &s;ame, to a fitter opportunity.</P>
<P>However by what is already &s;aid, it doth &s;ufficiently appear by what force, violence and intru&s;ion tho&s;e of the Engli&s;h Company have acted again&s;t us, both at <HI>Indraponra,</HI> as al&s;o at <HI>Batancapas</HI> and el&s;ewhere, and that con&s;e|quently, we have abundant rea&s;on to re|quire reparation and Satisfaction of them.</P>
<P>That which the Engli&s;h Company alled|geth again&s;t this, &s;o as it is contained in their Annex to the fore&s;aid <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Mar|quis of <HI>Albeville,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in this.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the Emperour of <HI>Maniarbohaer</HI> &s;hould have conferred and &s;etled that Coun|trey upon them, and had to this End &s;ent up two of his Sons to e&s;tabli&s;h the Engli&s;h there.</P>
<P>Secondly, that they by vertue thereof ha|ving built a Fort there, we in a time of peace had by violence a&s;&s;aulted them, and this only for the &s;ecuring of our Traffick in Pepper.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That we had di&s;dainfully tram|pled upon and torn the Pavillion of the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, That out of the Fort we had &s;hot at the Inhabitants of <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and at them that brought their Wares to Market.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, that our men had rob'd and taken away all the Marchandi&s;es, Effects,
<PB N="23" REF="63">Silverwork, Canon, and whatever they had there.</P>
<P>What concerns the fir&s;t point, it is mani|fe&s;t, that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> for many yeares hath had and &s;till hath the Dominion in and over the Countreys where <HI>Batancapas</HI> is &s;eated.</P>
<P>That this Authoritie and Dominion is now again lately in March 1686. conferred upon them with mo&s;t advantagious conditions, and are thereby &s;etled in the peaceable enjoyment thereof: So that they had not any lawful Right to in&s;tal and deliver up that Countrie into the hands of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>For as to the forementioned Emperor, whom the Engli&s;h &s;tile the Emperour of <HI>Manicabo,</HI> it is true that up or in the mid&s;t of the Coun|try of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> which are Lands of <HI>Mani|cabo,</HI> a certain Prince or Emperour doth reign.</P>
<P>But that the Prince ever came into the lower part of this Country, and as they pretend, e&s;ta|bli&s;hed the Engli&s;h there, &s;hall while the world &s;tands, never be proved by them.</P>
<P>For it is certain, that that Emperour never hath been in tho&s;e lower Countries, al&s;o in former times tho&s;e Lower Countries were &s;ubjected to the u&s;urped Authority of that Queen <HI>Seehini,</HI> who&s;e yoak long agoe they have ca&s;t off, and given over them&s;elves unto the Dominion of the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> who have taken upon them to protect and defend them
<PB N="24" REF="64">again&s;t all Oppo&s;ers what&s;oever.</P>
<P>However, according to our late Letters, it is true that there appeared in the&s;e Lower Countries two young Lords, &s;tiling them|&s;elves Princes, who al&s;o by &s;ome were acknow|ledged for &s;uch, but cryed down and rejected by others as Counterfits.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e they had been true and Law|ful Princes, yea the very Sons of the Empe|rour, which can never be proved, yet what right and Authority could they have to e&s;tabli&s;h the Engli&s;h there, muchle&s;s to make over the Country unto them, or what appearance of Truth can be imagined, they &s;hould have don the &s;ame?</P>
<P>It is certain never any of the <HI>English Com|pany</HI> have been up in tho&s;e Highlands with the Emperour; no not any of Netherlandi&s;h Company them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding they have lived more then fortie yeares upon the Nether-Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e Princes &s;hould have Order and Power from their Father to do this, is not &s;o much as affirmed, muchle&s;s proved by the Engli&s;h Company it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And although it could be proved, yet it mu&s;t come under examination, whether that Power and Authority could be &s;tretched &s;o far or not.</P>
<P>Yea be it how it will, it is enough for the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> that we according to the confe&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h them&s;elves,
<PB N="25" REF="64">not only were there before them, but al&s;o that three dayes before their arrival, we had fortifyed our &s;elves, yea as they &s;ay, upon a Rock.</P>
<P>Add to this, and which indeed is wholie de|ciding in the &s;ubject ca&s;e, that in the very Let|ter the Engli&s;h produce and annexed to the <HI>Memorial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> and to which he refers him&s;elf, it is &s;aid, that tho&s;e &s;o named Princes did declare, that in ca&s;e the Hollanders &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves at <HI>Batancapas</HI> before the Engli&s;h, that then the Engli&s;h &s;hould be fru&s;trated there|of. Words verie remarkable from &s;uch, by whom the Engli&s;h pretend to have obtained their right, e&s;petially it being &s;o fallen out as they &s;aid.</P>
<P>If notwith&s;tanding the Emperor of <HI>Mani|cabo</HI> might pretend any right to tho&s;e Lands, and declare that we did keep them in our po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion unlawfully, which we &s;uppo&s;e &s;hall never be; yet then it would be a que&s;tion to be decided betwixt the Emperor and us, and not with the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;econd point is al&s;o without any ground of truth, to wit, that our men &s;hould have taken that Fort by violence from them, the <HI>English</HI> them&s;elves affirm in a certain Letter, annexed to the fore&s;aid <HI>Memorial,</HI> that our men did diver&s;e times incite the <HI>Malbayers,</HI> and urged them to fall upon the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover that one <HI>Mechelen,</HI> whom in
<PB N="26" REF="65">their fore&s;aid Annex they name <HI>Muchalon,</HI> Commander in Chief of our Men there &s;hould have &s;aid to the <HI>English,</HI> and warned them to &s;ave them&s;elves, otherwi&s;e the <HI>Ma|leyers</HI> would fall upon and kill them.</P>
<P>But that the Engli&s;h not regarding tho&s;e threats, at the la&s;t our men &s;hould have commanded the <HI>Maleyers</HI> to fall upon them indeed.</P>
<P>Of which if they &s;hould be required, to bring in their proof it would be far to &s;eek, but on the contrary, it is a certain evi|dence that our men did endeavour their pre|&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Hoewever we deny not, that our <HI>Maleyers,</HI> that is, &s;uch of them as remained on our &s;ide, fell upon the other, which rebelled again&s;t us, and took in the Fort they yet held in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is worthy of Ob&s;ervation that the Engli&s;h them&s;elves confefs, that not &s;o much as a man of them was kild in that action, becau&s;e we prevented our <HI>Maleyers,</HI> with all our might hindring them from doing it; but &s;uppo&s;e it to be true, tho it be not &s;o, that our own men had taken the fort from the Engli&s;h, what can be ju&s;tly &s;aid again&s;t it? might we not drive them out of a Fort, which in di&s;pite of us they erected in a Coun|trey that belonged to us? and that right over again&s;t the Fortre&s;&s;e we had made there before, and after that by two Prote&s;ts we had warned
<PB N="27" REF="65">them not to do it, but would not at all li&s;ten to us.</P>
<P>So that as in&s;tead that the Engli&s;h take this up a matter of Complaint and accu&s;ation a|gain&s;t the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> they ought to have been thankful to them for their kind and mild dealing with them; yea &s;o far as to deliver them from eminent danger of death and ruin.</P>
<P>As one <HI>Samuel Bats,</HI> who at that time commanded the Engli&s;h, together with <HI>John Becton</HI> in their Letters have truely acknowledged.</P>
<P>And in ca&s;e one of our Soldiers did, as they affirm in di&s;daing tear in peeces the <HI>Pavillion</HI> of the King of England, altho it is not true, for according to the Letters thence received, the Engli&s;h them&s;elved pulled down their Flag, which &s;urely is more likely to be true, becau&s;e they apprehending the great danger they were in, would not let the Flag come into hands of their Enemies. But &s;uppo&s;e it were don by an Engli&s;h Souldier, what blame can be imputed to the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> in this?</P>
<P>Why did the Engli&s;h expo&s;e the Flag of their King in &s;uch manner, in the Territory and Country appertaining to another? Is it not a thing known, that a &s;trange Flag is not re&s;pected in any place what&s;oever?</P>
<P>That our men, according to the contents of the fourth point, &s;hould have &s;hot out of the
<PB N="28" REF="66">Fort with their Canon, is true: But it was don, not before, but after that the <HI>Rebellious Maleyers</HI> had a&s;&s;aulted us as Enemies.</P>
<P>And put the ca&s;e they had not done it, yet are we not for this re&s;pon&s;able to the <HI>English Company.</HI></P>
<P>Was it not free for our men to deal with them that had revolted and became Rebels, as they thought meet? Surely if we had dealt more rigourou&s;ly and in an ho&s;tile manner with them, they had &s;ufficiently de&s;erved the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The &s;poiling of their goods they make men|tion of in the fourth point, the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> denyes to have been done by their men. If it was don by the <HI>Maleyers,</HI> as in &s;uch occa&s;ions is ordinary, and therefore our State is not re&s;pon&s;able for that, be&s;ides what|ever we had pre&s;erved of theirs, was re&s;tored unto them again, as apperars by the foremen|tioned Letter, in which the Engli&s;h com|plain, not that our men had taken their Ca|non, but acknowledge it was don by the <HI>Maleyers,</HI> and that it was yet in their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Maleyers</HI> could take and carrie away the Canon, how much ea&s;ier was it for them to carrie away other things? So that hereby is a clear and unan&s;werable proof, that our people did not intermeddle with that bu|&s;ine&s;s, muchle&s;s that they &s;hould be guilty of the &s;poile made.</P>
<PB N="29" REF="66">
<P>And be&s;ides all this, the fore&s;aid <HI>Bats</HI> in the forementioned Letters only de&s;ireth, that we would endeavour to get into our hands, and &s;end him his Books and Writings, as al&s;o two men that were run away with one Moor, together what provi&s;ion of meat and drink they had left, without in the lea&s;t men|tioning any other thing, as well knowing it was not remaining in our, but in the hands of <HI>Maleyers:</HI> neither is it to be imagined to have been of any great importance, for in &s;uch a place, where the inevitable danger was fore|&s;een dayly by them, and where they had their Chalops and Boats, lying neer their very wals to put in what&s;oever was of any worth, it is not ea&s;ily to be believed, they left any thing behind them, they made any great e&s;teem of, but only what they willingly would part with: and al&s;o whatever the <HI>Dutch Com|pany</HI> could &s;ave, or get out of the hands of he <HI>Maleyers,</HI> was re&s;tored unto them.</P>
<P>And can the&s;e men be heard, or any be|lief given to what was robd and taken from them was delivered into the hands of the Comman|der in Chief of the <HI>Dutch Company,</HI> as they af|firmatively depo&s;e in the Anaex of the <HI>Memo|rial</HI> of the Marquis of <HI>Albiville,</HI> whereas in the <HI>Indies</HI> they not only mentioned not a word thereof, but on the contrary by their Let|ters they declared their thanckfulne&s;s to that Commander in Chief, for the great Love
<PB N="30" REF="67">and Friend&s;hip he had &s;hewed him.</P>
<P>Add to this, that when the fore&s;aid <HI>Bats</HI> worte, that he had received the goods, he &s;ent for in his foregoing Letters, that if there had been any thing more in our hands, would he not have de&s;ired that it might al&s;o had have bin conveyed to him? undoubtedly he would.</P>
<P>And yet they are not a&s;hamed to alledge &s;uch frivolous things and fictions, if &s;o be they might but by any meanes make our ca&s;e odious to the world.</P>
<P>For it &s;eemeth the <HI>English Company</HI> &s;eekes to make it their Cu&s;tom, by Complaints how ungrounded and futil &s;oever they are to pre|occupie, and thereby to get an advantage to the prejudice of the <HI>Dutch Companie:</HI> but we doubt but they &s;hal fall &s;hort of their aim as in this, as they have in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bantam.</HI></P>
<P>This is that which the <HI>English Company</HI> in the <HI>Memorial</HI> they delivered up do make the ground of their Complaints, affirming that the de&s;ign of the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> was nothing el&s;e then by inju&s;tice, violence and oppre&s;&s;ion to ingro&s;s into their hands the whole Commerce in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and that, as they add, by continuance. But that they hope His Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> will time|ly provide &s;uch remedies whereby &s;uch con|tinual Intru&s;ions, Inva&s;ions and ingro&s;&s;ings of the <HI>Netherlandish Companie</HI> may be pre|vented.</P>
<P>But we would willingly know of the <HI>En|glish

<P>Be&s;ides it is well known that the Countries in the <HI>Indies</HI> and in <HI>Africa</HI> are &s;o great and numerous, the di&s;tricts almo&s;t infinite, that it would be a great pre&s;umption, yea folly once to imagin it, not to &s;peak of the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility to effect the &s;ame.</P>
<P>'Tis true (and herewith al&s;o &s;hall be &s;po|ken in An&s;wer to the fourth point, which we re&s;erved to this place) that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> hath with a few uncon&s;iderable Po|tentates or Princes made Contracts over a Privative or Seclu&s;ive Traffick of &s;ome kind Wares which their Countries did yield. But if the <HI>English Company</HI> &s;hould maintain this to be an unlawful thing, they mu&s;t condemn their own doing, and &s;o as it were pronounce Sen|tence again&s;t what them&s;elves have done in former times; and of which many examples may be alledged: Now if the <HI>English Compa|ny</HI> hath made &s;uch contracts, &s;ometimes with|out, and &s;ometimes together with us, when we were in a nearer League Anno 1619. and &s;ome years following, as may be &s;een and will appear in the <HI>Publick Te&s;timonies Wri|tings</HI> lying by us.</P>
<PB N="32" REF="68">
<P>And when the <HI>English Company</HI> had &s;uch Contracts with us together, then according to their &s;entiment, it was lawful and good. But now the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> doth the &s;ame without them, as having no communion or fellow&s;hip in the lea&s;t with them in the <HI>Indies,</HI> it is condemned and exclaimed again&s;t by them, as being unrea&s;onable: Ought they not to call to memorie, that in former times the Engli&s;h Marchants had the whole Traf|fick of the <HI>Caveyaer</HI> which <HI>Ru&s;land</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;co|via</HI> did yield.</P>
<P>And to come yet clo&s;er to them, have they not made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and yet dayly &s;eek to make &s;uch Contracts, e&s;pecially on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabaer?</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> hath ere|cted here and there &s;ome Forts for the &s;ecurity of their Trade, and al&s;o to make the People of tho&s;e Countries to &s;tand to the Contracts made with them, cannot be imputed a Crime to the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> or the <HI>English Company</HI> mu&s;t confe&s;s them&s;elves guiltie of the &s;aid crime, for they al&s;o have made Forts for the &s;ame end at <HI>Boucoulo</HI> and <HI>Indraponra,</HI> and moreover endeavoured to do the like at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> with what face then can the <HI>En|glish Company</HI> blame us in this? and lay it as a grat evil to our charge, whereas they them|&s;elves at <HI>Priaman</HI> (being on the We&s;t-Coa&s;t of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> a Country under the &s;ubjection
<PB N="33" REF="68">of the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> and where they had a Fortre&s;&s;e) not only intended, but even actually took in hand to &s;ettle them&s;elves, yea al&s;o according to the Octroy or Charter granted them by the King now reigning, as to other things, &s;o in &s;pecial to build a Royal Fortre&s;s, fortifyed with 40 great Peeces of Ca|non, Maga&s;ins, Wharfs for Shipping, and all other Hou&s;es and Buildings, there to e|rect a <HI>Court of Ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>Admiralty,</HI> and henceforward there to regulate and govern them&s;elves after the &s;ame manner, that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> (the&s;e are their verie terms) are wont to do in their places, com|manding them that in the Building of that great and Royal Fort, they &s;hould well pro|vide for the &s;ecurity of their men, not only a|gain&s;t the mutinous People of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> but al&s;o (which is not to be pa&s;&s;ed by without a Nota bene) again&s;t their outlandi&s;h Enemies, the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>For however that de&s;ign of theirs was not effected, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h coming there with their Ships, found that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> them&s;elves had a Fort there, &s;o that had they gon forward, they &s;aw it mu&s;t be by falling upon us in a ho&s;tile way, and drive us from thence, which in appearance they dared not, yet to attempt: may we not here|upon ju&s;tly demand, whether if they of the <HI>En|glish Company</HI> having attained to their de&s;ired intent, as to that City would not have kept
<PB N="34" REF="69">it alone to them&s;elves, and whether they would have &s;uffered us to trade together with them there? For then the Fortre&s;s built at &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive charges in that City would have been of no u&s;e or benefit, but a burthen only.</P>
<P>But in ca&s;e they now had near <HI>Priaman</HI> by force of Arms compelled &s;ome of tho&s;e Princes thereabout, or that any of them had of their own free will &s;ubmitted to the <HI>Engli&s;h Com|pany,</HI> (for there are diver&s;e Princes and Peo|ples, who have every one apart their Juri&s;dic|tions and Command, and for many years &s;ince &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to us) if I &s;ay, they &s;hould by force of Armes overcom any of the &s;aid Princes, or if any of them &s;hould willingly, and of their own accord &s;ubmit to the &s;aid <HI>Eng|glish Company,</HI> and make privative or &s;eclu&s;ive Contracts with them, tho perhaps they had not built any Forts in the Countrie, and that the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> would thereupon intrude them&s;elves, and deprive the Engli&s;h of their intre&s;t, by building a Fortre&s;&s;e, to hinder them from enjoying the Fruits and Benefits of the Contracts made with tho&s;e Nations: might not in &s;uch a ca&s;e the Engli&s;h ju&s;tly have oppo&s;ed us, yea driven us away by force? un|doubtly they mought.</P>
<P>If then it de&s;erve to be judged inju&s;tice, vio|lence and oppre&s;&s;ion in us, by lawful means to &s;eek in one and the other Countrie out of or beyond <HI>Europe,</HI> to get and appropriate to our &s;elves the Trade thereof: Then we know
<PB N="35" REF="69">not, how po&s;&s;ibly the Engli&s;h can be judged blamele&s;s, con&s;idering what they have don in <HI>Carolina, Virginia, New-England, Jamaica,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, Countries of that va&s;t extent, that all what the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> doth po&s;|&s;e&s;s in <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> is not to be compared thereunto.</P>
<P>And in ca&s;e it be lawful to be don there, why then may it not be don by the <HI>Dutch Company</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies?</HI> except that it can be de|mon&s;trated, that the Rights of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> are not of the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P>But to remain only within the bounds of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies.</HI> The <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> would fain know, upon what account <HI>Sillebaer, Bon|coulo, Indraponra, &amp;c.</HI> were taken and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Engli&s;h? to what end they erected Forts there? e&s;pecialy if their de&s;ign at <HI>Pria|man</HI> had &s;ucceeded, was it not to draw and appropriate unto them the Commerce of Pep|per, as much as they could? They endea|voured to make and fortifie <HI>Priaman</HI> in &s;uch a manner, for &s;o their Orders runs, that they might be in a po&s;ture to with&s;tand the <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI> whom they term, their Enemies.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Netherlandish Company,</HI> be thus lookt upon by them, it is no wonder, their Mini&s;ters and Servants in the <HI>Indies</HI> labour to do us all the &s;pite, mi&s;chief and injury they po&s;|&s;ibly can.</P>
<P>Whereas on the contrarie our men, accord|ing to the Letters which from time to time
<PB N="36" REF="70">we receive thence, endeavour nothing more, then to plea&s;e and conde&s;cend to them in all things, according to the order which our States do continually give unto us: hereby al|&s;o, were it po&s;&s;ible, to free your Pui&s;&s;: High|ne&s;&s;es from further Complaints and Mole&s;ta|tions, with which your Pui&s;&s;: Highne&s;&s;es are &s;o often di&s;turbed by the Engli&s;h: but the greater conde&s;cention we have u&s;ed and la|bored to &s;hew unto them, what advantages and quiet &s;oever we endeavoured to procure, what affronts &s;oever we pa&s;t by, all is but labor lo&s;t, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Letters we receive from the <HI>Indies</HI> te&s;tifie, is as Oyl ca&s;t into the fire, and only makes them the more audacious and fierce agan&s;t us.</P>
<P>And had we at the fir&s;t at <HI>Indraponra,</HI> &s;toutly oppo&s;ed and hindred them from &s;ettling them|&s;elves there, to which we had an indi&s;putable Right, they would not have ventured to have undertaken, what they did at <HI>Batancapas,</HI> and the troubles thereon en&s;uing would have been prevented, our conde&s;cention and indul|gence being the only occa&s;ion they abu&s;ed thereunto.</P>
<P>If at any time infraction or inju&s;tice hath bin committed, they mu&s;t have recour&s;e to what happened in the bu&s;ine&s;s on the We&s;t-Coa&s;t, of which the <HI>Netherlandish Company</HI> hopes after &s;ome time to make full di&s;coverie to your Pui&s;&s;: Highne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>However this is underniable that our Men
<PB N="37" REF="70">now lately at <HI>Bengale</HI> did the Engli&s;h a &s;ignal &s;ervice, for when they were in a great extremi|tie, and the Moors had deprived them of all meanes of Livelyhood, then by our mediation and intervention the bu&s;ine&s;s was brought to a ce&s;&s;ation of all acts of ho&s;tility for a time: &s;o far was it from our intent to plot, or cau&s;e any harm to come to them, for if it had bin &s;o, ne|ver fairer opportunity was put into the hands of any, then in that bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Bengale,</HI> wherein the Engli&s;h, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of Hundreds of their men, would have &s;u&s;tained irreparable dammage in their E&s;tates and occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>At <HI>Batavia</HI> we took them into us, without in the lea&s;t being obliged thereto, there we harbored them a long time, we permitted their Ships coming in and going out, to enjoy all manner of nece&s;&s;aries and refre&s;hments, notwith&s;tanding all the continual na&s;tine&s;&s;es and pilfrings of their men; yea tho&s;e very Ships which came from the We&s;t-Coa&s;t in that mi|&s;erable and de&s;olate condition, and where they had dealt &s;o inhumanely with our men, as hath bin related, yet we provided them not onely with whatever they needed, but al&s;o let them them repair, and new build them again upon our Wharfs.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e the Subjects of our Stase &s;hould com to reque&s;t &s;uch a thing of them in the <HI>Caribes, Barbados, Virgina, Jamaica,</HI> or other places, they not only would not have admitted, but rather &s;ea&s;ed and confi&s;cated them. The &s;ame
<PB N="38" REF="71">u&s;age al&s;o in likelihood, we might expect from them at <HI>Madra&s;patnam,</HI> or their Fort S. <HI>Georg,</HI> where as hath be &s;aid, they have &s;etled them|&s;elves on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cormandel,</HI> or at lea&s;t would &s;end us packing away from thence.</P>
<P>Their Ship the Royal <HI>James</HI> coming in Sept. 1686. from <HI>England,</HI> and arriving at <HI>Priaman,</HI> with the lo&s;s of about 40. Mariners and 30. Soldiers, together with all their Chief Officers unto the verie la&s;t Sergeant they had, in expe|ctation to have found there a Royal Factorie, but in &s;tead thereof meeting with our Men, and departing from thence, at their earne&s;t re|que&s;t, we furni&s;hed them with all manner of refre&s;hments, they pleading that becau&s;e the &s;ea&s;on was wel pa&s;t they entended to &s;ail to <HI>Padang</HI> in <HI>Bengale,</HI> but in &s;tead thereof, they &s;tiered their cours to <HI>Indraponra,</HI> where they knew there was nothing to be found for them, &s;ave men, ammonition and &s;uch like nece&s;&s;aries for War, with which they provided them&s;elves the better to maintain the place again&s;t us.</P>
<P>Their Ship the <HI>Herbert,</HI> beeing arrived before <HI>Batavia,</HI> &s;ome of their men came into the Citie with Pocket Pi&s;tols, and pickt a quarrel in their Lodging in the night, and making u&s;e of their Pi&s;tols, they were by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the People and Magi&s;trates Ser|vants di&s;armed, their Pi&s;tols by force taken away, otherwi&s;e it had undoubtedly co&s;t much Blood, and &s;o the&s;e impudent men were cha&s;ed out of the Citie.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="71">
<P>And be&s;ides &s;ome other Ships, the 1. of De|cember of the la&s;t yea, there arrived at <HI>Cochin,</HI> a Citie belonging to the <HI>Netherlandish Com|pany</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mallabaer,</HI> a certain En|gli&s;h Fregat (named <HI>Madras,</HI> and the Captain <HI>John Wallis,</HI> comming from <HI>Cormandel,</HI> being bound for <HI>Suratta,</HI> who after he got fre&s;h Victuals and Water, and was without being taken notice of, come abord, he entrepri&s;ed in the night time with a boat propt with men to enter a certain Moors Ship, who &s;om dayes before as come from <HI>Suratta</HI> into that <HI>Rode,</HI> he throughly &s;earched the &s;ame, while that 15. Mu&s;quetiers with their Cocks bent lay in rea|dine&s;s near unto them, and required the <HI>Tan|del</HI> or Boat&s;man (the Ma&s;ter then being on Land at <HI>Coehin</HI>) to &s;hew him his Pa&s;port, who affirming that he had it not, took him along with him out of his Ship, and having brought him a bord his own, with much threatning commanded him to fetch his Pas from Land, but when the &s;aid Boat&s;man was returned from Land, he &s;aw that the fore&s;aid Engli&s;h|man was departed, after he thus u&s;ed vio|lence in the Rode, where all ought to be in the greate&s;t &s;ecuritie.</P>
<P>Again, on the fourth of the &s;aid moneth there arrived at <HI>Cochin</HI> for the &s;ame end an Engli&s;h Schip called <HI>Carolus Secundus,</HI> mounted with 60 Guns and about threehundred men, <HI>Mari|ners</HI> and <HI>Soldiers,</HI> having near 50 dead and 80 &s;ick per&s;ons after he was come from England
<PB N="40" REF="72">the foregoing May: and notwith&s;tanding it was remon&s;trated, and complaints made to the Captain <HI>Jonathan Andrews</HI> of the in|jurie and violence he did to our Companie, yet he was not a&s;hamed to pretend a right to vi&s;it a Moors Ship in our Rode, come hither from <HI>Suratta,</HI> upon the pretext that in the &s;aid Moors Ship there were Engli&s;h Fugitives, however he was at la&s;t per&s;waded to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Now in ca&s;e one or more Ships of the <HI>Ne|therlandish Company</HI> &s;hould undertake in the Rhode of <HI>Madra&s;patnam,</HI> a Citie as hath bin &s;aid, belonging to the Engli&s;h <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies Company,</HI> to vi&s;it, &s;earch and deal with them after the &s;ame manner the Engli&s;h have done in our Rodes, what horrid Exclamations would they not make throughout Europe about it? What pretences of injuries, affronts and dammages would they not divulge? And yet this is the verie thing they dare to enter|pri&s;e in our Rodes and Rivers.</P>
<P>They complain of Infraction, Wrong, In|ju&s;tice offred them: But if ever any wrong or inju&s;tice hath been done, it is apparently to be &s;een in this, and in a matter of &s;uch tenderne&s;s and con&s;equence.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;e by in &s;ilence, that the Engli&s;h have endeavoured, and yet continue dayly to debauch and intice our men by money to de|&s;ert us and enter into their &s;ervice, witne&s;&s;e what they do at <HI>Bengale,</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cor|mandel, Suratta,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, neither have
<PB N="41" REF="72">we ever been able to make them to de&s;i&s;t from the&s;e their continued practi&s;es for &s;o many years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, by all the Prote&s;tations and Complaints made and delivered up unto them: And in ca&s;e we feared not to be overtrouble|&s;om to your Pui&s;&s;.
