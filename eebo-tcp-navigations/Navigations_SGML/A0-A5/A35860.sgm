<HEAD>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A Director of the New <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, and one of the Committee for preparing <HI>By-Laws</HI> for the &s;aid Company, concerning tho&s;e particular things propo&s;ed for <HI>By-Laws</HI> which are di&s;liked by the Directors.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Direct.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Am glad to find you here alone, that if your Bu&s;ine&s;s will permit, we may have a little di&s;cour&s;e about &s;ome By-Laws that you and others of the Committee &s;eem earne&s;t for, which are not agreeable to our Directors; and per|haps when you have heard the Rea&s;ons I have to offer again&s;t them, you will be of another mind. There are &s;everal that you propo&s;e, which we di&s;like; but that which more e&s;pecially di&s;plea&s;eth us is a ROTATION. The Word is not common, and the Method (if I apprehend it right) is not practi&s;ed in any Companies among&s;t us; therefore pray explain to me what you mean by it: for the Directors are alarm'd at it, and re&s;olve with all their Power and Intere&s;t to oppo&s;e it; and in order to that end, they are prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing their Friends and Acquaintance with Prejudices again&s;t it.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Committ.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Rotation de&s;ired is in &s;hort this: That no Man &s;hall continue a Director above three years &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, nor be excluded from being a Director above one year in four; &s;o that every year there &s;hall be a Change of eight, that the whole twenty four may fall off, or be changed in the &s;pace of three years; and yet the eight that go off one year may come in the next, and continue three years more &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, if cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Thus tho&s;e Directors that have the general e&s;teem of the Members, may not be out above one year in &s;even: which will be only a little retreat from the Hurry of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that every wi&s;e man would chu&s;e, tho he were not obliged to it.</P>
<P>And for my part, I cannot &s;ee that this Method will be at|tended with any ill Con&s;equences to the Company's Affairs, that &s;hould cau&s;e in the Directors &s;uch a di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t it, as you &s;ay it doth; but on the contrary it will be a great means to prevent that Corruption among&s;t them, that one continued Set of Directors would naturally pro|duce.</P>
<P>The Wi&s;dom of this Nation found many Inconveniencies in long Parliaments; and therefore enacted that there &s;hould be a new one every three years; which is as much of the manner of a Rotation as the nature of that thing will admit: And if there be a nece&s;&s;ity for the frequent Change of Parliaments, there &s;eems a much greater nece&s;&s;ity for a frequent Change of the Directors of a Company, where the Temptations are great, and Opportunities of getting Money by indirect ways do offer them&s;elves continually; as by Pre&s;ents, Gifts, and Bribes, Private Trade, and many other ways that Committee-men of other Companies have found out, and may in time be di&s;covered by the dexterous Managers of this New Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand the manner of the Rotation you de&s;ire, which &s;eems principally intended to prevent Corruption a|mong&s;t the Directors; but I do not under&s;tand that you
<PB N="5" REF="3">have Power to make &s;uch a By-Law if it was convenient; becau&s;e the words of your Charter &s;ay that the twenty four that have the majority of Votes &s;hall be your Direc|tors, and this By-Law would exclude eight of the Direc|tors every Year, altho they &s;hould have the majority of Votes. So that this is repugnant to your Charter; and notwith&s;tanding any By-Law you can make to the contrary, tho&s;e that &s;hall have the mo&s;t Votes may in&s;i&s;t upon their Right to the Director&s;hip by virtue of your Charter: And if they do &s;o, will have Remedy in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Company have no Power to make &s;uch a By-Law, it would be in vain to attempt it; for if it was made, it would be null and void in it &s;elf: but &s;ome Gentlemen of the long Robe, and tho&s;e of the fir&s;t Rank, &s;ay, &s;uch a By-Law is not repugnant to our Charter, and when con|firm'd by the General Court will be valid. Therefore I am of Opinion few Men would think it advi&s;eable to in&s;i&s;t upon their Right of Election in oppo&s;ition to this By-Law; If any &s;hould be &s;o &s;tubborn to di&s;pute it, the General Court hath Power to turn them out, and doubtle&s;s will a&s;&s;ert their Power in &s;uch a Ca&s;e. But, Sir, to put this matter pa&s;t all doubt, the By-Law may run thus: That at the next Annual Election none &s;hall put in their Li&s;ts the Names of more than &s;ixteen of the old Directors; and at the next following Annual Election, they &s;hall not put in their Li&s;ts more than eight of the Names of tho&s;e that have &s;erved two Years. And at the third Annual Election, they &s;hall not put in their Li&s;ts any Names of tho&s;e eight that have &s;erved three Years. And if any Li&s;ts be found contrary to this By-Law, the Scrutineers &s;hall have Power and be obli|ged to reject them; and of this, publick Notice may be given in the Printed Li&s;ts before every Annual Elec|tion.</P>
<P>By this Method the words of the Charter will not be con|tradicted, but tho&s;e twenty four that have the mo&s;t Votes will be the Directors: And Certainly a General Court
<PB N="6" REF="4">hath Power to make a By-Law to change as many Direc|tors yearly as they plea&s;e, keeping &s;till to the Method above, that tho&s;e that have the mo&s;t Votes &s;hall be the Directors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But granting you have a power to make &s;uch a By-Law, the que&s;tion will be whether it be expedient; and I have two very good Rea&s;ons to offer again&s;t the expediency of it. For fir&s;t, it takes away that liberty of Choice that the Charter gives you; for now you have liberty to chu&s;e whom you plea&s;e, but this By-Law re&s;trains you, and &s;ays you &s;hall every Year change eight altho you are unwilling to change any: and methinks while the general Court hath a Power to turn out all, or as many of the Directors as they plea&s;e, and when they plea&s;e, this is a needle&s;s Law, and &s;eems to take away, or le&s;&s;en the Power now ve&s;ted in the General Court; for what need we oblige our &s;elves to change eight every Year, when we have Pow|er if we think it for our Advantage, not only to change eight, but all the four and twenty? And</P>
<P>Secondly, This By-Law is not expedient, becau&s;e it obli|geth us to lay a&s;ide every Director one Year in four; which may be of very ill con&s;equence to the Company's Affairs, becau&s;e in all Companies there are u&s;ually &s;ome particular Men that by their Parts, Application and Experience at|tain to great Dexterity and Skill in the Bu&s;ine&s;s under their management above the re&s;t; and &s;uch Men the Company cannot with &s;afety part withal: they become &s;o u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, that if it were po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould &s;it at the Helm all their Lives, to direct the Affairs of the Com|pany.</P>
<P>I think the&s;e Arguments again&s;t the expediency of this By-Law carry &s;o much weight, that to me they &s;eem unan|&s;werable; but if you can give me better Rea&s;ons for the expediency of it than I have given you again&s;t it, I &s;hall be willing to hear them: for it is again&s;t Fle&s;h and Blood to part with three &s;uch dear things, as are Power, Honour, and Profit.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Arguments again&s;t the expediency of a Rota|tion &s;eem very plau&s;ible and &s;trong; they carry with them a fair &s;how and appearance, and may doubtle&s;s obtain with many who do not give them&s;elves lei&s;ure to con&s;ider and examine them. Yet were it not for tho&s;e dear things you la&s;t mentioned, I &s;hould hope to convince you and all the Directors, as I doubt not to do every Man that is not pre|judiced.</P>
<P>I grant that the Charter doth ve&s;t the General Courts with a Power to do all tho&s;e things you mention, to place and di&s;place Directors at their plea&s;ure: but the pinch is here; How &s;hall they come to u&s;e or exert that Power? For the Que&s;tion is not here, what we may or have liberty by our Charter to do; but what we can do, or is in our power to do, the nature and circum&s;tances of things being duly con&s;idered. For there mu&s;t be a majority in a Gene|ral Court to do it: the General Court will not turn out any Director unle&s;s they are &s;atisfied of his unfitne&s;s for their Service; and pray which way can they be &s;atisfied, but only by &s;ufficient Proof in an open Court? And I would gladly &s;ee that Per&s;on that will undertake to accu&s;e any Director in a General Court, and prove his Crimes or Unfitne&s;s for their Service to the &s;atisfaction of a major part.</P>
<P>As the matter &s;tands now with us, notwith&s;tanding all this noi&s;e of Power to turn out and put in at plea&s;ure, I &s;ay a General Court cannot turn out a Man unle&s;s they can lay their fingers on a Director, and &s;ay this Man is not fit for our Service, for &s;uch and &s;uch Rea&s;ons; which mu&s;t al&s;o be proved (as I ob&s;erved before) to the &s;atisfaction of the majority of the Members then pre&s;ent: which is &s;o difficult a matter, that as I have not, &s;o I never expect to &s;ee an In&s;tance of it. What I have now &s;aid is only with re&s;pect to the turning out of any particular Member or Members between the times of annual Elections: for what can be done by a General Court at the annual Elections as to the
<PB N="8" REF="5">changing of Directors, &s;hall be &s;poke to by and by. But be|fore I come to that Point, I &s;hall ob&s;erve to you, that the General Court hath in effect no Power to fill the Place of any Director that happens to die within the Year, or doth for any Rea&s;on whatever voluntarily quit their Service: For tho every Member having five hundred pound Stock hath liberty to vote for whom he plea&s;eth, yet it hath al|ways been ob&s;erved in the Bank of <HI>England</HI> that between the Annual Elections, when only one, two or three Direc|tors were to be cho&s;en, very few Members did concern them&s;elves in tho&s;e Elections; &s;o that the Choice hath been u&s;ually carried by &s;eventy or eighty odd Votes, and the common Method hath been, that the Directors have agreed together upon a Per&s;on or Per&s;ons that they liked to fill up the Vacancy, and accordingly made their own Li&s;ts, and di&s;tributed the &s;ame among&s;t their Friends and Acquain|tance; and &s;o they never failed, nor can ever fail, of ha|ving the very Per&s;on or Per&s;ons they de&s;ire. For &s;uppo&s;e every Director can but engage three Per&s;ons Votes be&s;ides his own, they will certainly carry any &s;uch &s;ingle Election: and he mu&s;t be a Man of a very &s;mall Intere&s;t and Repu|tation, or recommend &s;ome infamous Per&s;on indeed, that cannot procure three or four Votes be&s;ides his own. And as this hath been, and is ever like to be, the practice in the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> &s;o it is natural to believe, it will ever be the Practice in this Company: and I mu&s;t confe&s;s I know no Remedy again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the General Courts have the Name, and the Directors the Power, to place and di&s;place &s;ingle Di|rectors. Let us now con&s;ider what General Courts can do in changing Directors at the Annnal Elections. And we may make &s;ome gue&s;s at it by what hath been done in the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> which is a Con&s;titution that comes the neare&s;t to that of this Company of any we have among&s;t us, and indeed as to Elections is the very &s;ame. And there we find, till the Parliament did remedy that Evil, there could
<PB N="9" REF="5">be no Change of Directors; but till that time from their fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment, the very &s;ame Men. were continued without the alteration of one &s;ingle Per&s;on, except tho&s;e that voluntarily re&s;ign'd, and <HI>Patter&s;on</HI> for &s;ome notorious Crimes, and &s;o had continued till this very day, and per|haps as long as the Bank will continue, except where Death interven'd, or that they had fallen out among them|&s;elves. There were Attempts and Endeavours u&s;ed by the Members to make &s;ome alterations at every new Choice, but all in vain; the Directors Li&s;ts always prevailed, not that the fir&s;t twenty four were the be&s;t and fitte&s;t Men in all the Company, or had an univer&s;al Reputation of being &s;uch, but tho&s;e old ones did generally combine and confe|derate together, and by that means made a greater Inte|re&s;t for one another, than could be made for any other Per&s;ons (not of their Number) by a General Court, where the Members are not known to one another, have divided Intere&s;ts, are unacquainted with Men, cannot po&s;&s;ibly have any combinations together, and in general take &s;uch Li&s;ts as are offer'd them, which for the mo&s;t part are &s;uch as the Directors and their Friends di&s;per&s;e among&s;t the Mem|bers, who have heard the Names of tho&s;e that are Direc|tors (for by Name they are known to all the Company) and tho perhaps they neither know their Per&s;ons nor Qua|lifications, yet they think they may as well be govern'd by tho&s;e they have heard of, as tho&s;e they have not; and &s;o they take the Li&s;ts <HI>de bene e&s;&s;e,</HI> and many times put them into the Gla&s;s without &s;cruple or reading. Some may be &s;o curious as to read the Names, and ask Que&s;tions about them; but they are &s;ure to have a favourable Character given by tho&s;e that recommend them. Some indeed will alter a Name or two, and put in their room others they know or think to be hone&s;t Men, their Neighbours or Ac|quaintance. Another alters another Name or Names for &s;ome other Per&s;ons he e&s;teems; yet this can never bring in their Friends, nor exclude the others, but &s;till the Gene|ral
<PB N="10" REF="6">Li&s;t prevails; for perhaps I put in the Name of one that may not be in two Li&s;ts be&s;ides, another doth the &s;ame, a third likewi&s;e, and &s;o on. Thus I leave out one Per|&s;on, another keeps him in and leaves out another, a third and fourth do &s;o likewi&s;e; but all this doth not help their Friends, nor hurt tho&s;e they would exclude. For unle&s;s the putting in and leaving out of Names be general, it can &s;ignifie nothing. This is &s;o plain and experienced a Truth, that you Directors all know it, and every Man that will but con&s;ider a little will ea&s;ily di&s;cern it. Therefore tho you &s;ay a Rotation will take away from General Courts that Liberty of Choice the Charter gives them, and what they now enjoy, I do affirm, and it is evident by con&s;idering what I have already &s;aid, that as the matter now &s;tands, the General Court hath in effect no liberty of Choice at all, but the whole Power of Elections is lodged with the Di|rectors; and without a Rotation they will always keep them&s;elves in, or what Directors they plea&s;e, in &s;pite of General Courts. Nothing can be an equal Ballance to the Dire&s;tors Lif&s;t, except you can &s;uppo&s;e twenty four other Members all of as great Intere&s;t, and as univer&s;ally known to the Members of the Company as the Directors are; and that tho&s;e twenty four join together to make and di&s;per&s;e one Li&s;t: which is not to be imagined for &s;undry Rea&s;ons, that are &s;o obvious that I &s;hall not &s;pend time to mention them.</P>
<P>But, Sir, to evince the Truth of what I have &s;aid concer|ning the Power the Directors have to govern and influ|ence Elections, let us look back and con&s;ider what they have done already in their Infancy; by which we may con|jecture what they will do, or at lea&s;t may do hereafter. And fir&s;t, before they were Directors, or con&s;equently were &s;o well known as they are now, or will be &s;ome time hence, they met together, agreed upon one Li&s;t of twenty four, and carried every Man in it but three to be Directors. The next Choice was a Committee of twenty four for
<PB N="11" REF="6">preparing By-Laws, about which the Directors al&s;o met, agreed upon a Li&s;t, and had them all cho&s;en but two. And as the Elections have hitherto been wholly governed by the Wills and Power of the Directors, &s;o they will always continue to be, except we e&s;tabli&s;h a Rotation by a By-Law to prevent it: which I think is the only means we can u&s;e to hinder and avoid Combinations and Confederacies, and many other Inconveniencies and Mi&s;chiefs that will follow them; of which more anon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are of Opinion the Directors can bring in and keep out whom they plea&s;e, you act again&s;t your own Intere&s;t to &s;hew &s;o much zeal for a By-Law &s;o di&s;plea&s;ing to them all: for this firmne&s;s of yours in this and &s;ome other matters doth exa&s;perate them again&s;t you to the high|e&s;t degree, that there is no expectation they will ever admit you into their Number, of which before there was a fair pro&s;pect; and then you might probably have continued in that Station all your Life, which would have been much more for your advantage than you can reap by &s;triving for this By-Law, which the Directors are re&s;olved &s;hall never pa&s;s. So you are like to lo&s;e both the By-Law, and all hopes of ever being a Director.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I readily grant I have acted again&s;t my Intere&s;t, if a Director&s;hip and Profit may be reckon'd &s;o: but tho&s;e things were not my Aim; if they had, I knew a nearer way to have obtain'd them. I am entru&s;ted by the Gene|ral Court to a&s;&s;i&s;t in preparing &s;uch By-Laws as my un|bia&s;s'd Rea&s;on, Judgment, and Con&s;cience tell me are for the general good of the Company; and not by any ba&s;e compliance to betray my Tru&s;t, tho to my own advantage. If I am in the wrong, it proceeds from an Error of my Judg|ment, not of my Will; and all the World &s;hall not make me &s;peak or vote contrary to my Rea&s;on, and what I appre|hend for the Benefit and Safety of the Company; nor &s;neak away or ab&s;ent my &s;elf purpo&s;ely from the Committee for fear of incurring &s;ome Gentlemens di&s;plea&s;ure. For he
<PB N="12" REF="7">that hath Mea&s;ures to keep, Intere&s;ts to &s;erve, and &s;tands in fear of di&s;plea&s;ing others, can hardly be an hone&s;t Man, and is certainly unfit for any publick Tru&s;t. Such a Man dares not act according to the Dictates of his own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience, but pro&s;titutes both to the Will of his Pa|trons. And methinks if your Directors that are &s;o violent and angry would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider it, they would think that we have as much Rea&s;on to be angry with them for dif|fering in Opinion from us, as they have to be angry with us for differing in Opinion from them, except they can pre|tend to Infallibility or Revelation.</P>
<P>I would ask your angry Men this plain &s;hort Que&s;tion, Whether upon any Debate they give their Opinions and Votes according to their Judgment or not? I mu&s;t take it for granted they will an&s;wer, they do; and if &s;o, why do they blame us for acting as they do them&s;elves?</P>
<P>You have led me into a long Digre&s;&s;ion: but I will now proceed to con&s;ider the &s;econd Argument again&s;t the expediency of a Rotation, which centers in this, That u&s;ual|ly &s;ome Men in all Companies attain to &s;uch a Degree of skill in managing their Affairs, that the Company cannot well be without them.</P>
<P>This Argument will &s;erve as well for the Continuation of Magi&s;trates, Mini&s;ters and Secretaries of State for Life: and yet we find wi&s;e People, and jealous of their Liberties, make frequent Changes of them. The little State of <HI>Luc|ca</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> by changing their Magi&s;trates every two Months, and the Re&s;traint they are kept under while they bear Of|fice, have pre&s;erved their Liberty while mo&s;t of their neighbouring States have lo&s;t theirs. And the Secretaries of State one would think more nece&s;&s;ary to be continued, on account of their Skill, Experience and Knowledg of pub|lick Affairs, than any Director in an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company. Yet we have &s;een many Changes made of them, even here at home, without any harm or prejudice to the State.</P>
<P>But further, this Argument of yours is again&s;t any
<PB N="13" REF="7">Change of Directors at all; for it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed that tho&s;e that fall off have more knowledg of the Affairs of the Company than new ones that have not been Directors be|fore. And &s;o by a parity of Rea&s;on we &s;hould always continue the &s;ame Men, becau&s;e new ones have le&s;s Skill and Experience than the old ones. This indeed might be a good Method to have always a Set of Directors that are acquainted with the Company's Bu&s;ine&s;s; but it is to be fea|red they would al&s;o be acquainted with ways of making Advantages to them&s;elves, di&s;tinct and &s;eparate from that of the Company: and then how knowing &s;oever they might be in the Company's Bu&s;ine&s;s, that would be &s;ure to be made &s;ub&s;ervient to their own Intere&s;t, and all their thoughts turn'd to their private gain.</P>
<P>In the Old Company we have &s;een this verified; for there &s;ome Per&s;ons have been Committee Men many Years toge|ther, and doubtle&s;s did, or at lea&s;t had opportunities e|nough of attaining to a perfect Knowledg of that Company's Affairs; and yet the &s;ingle Advantage of that Company was neglected, while they employed their Thoughts, Time and Study how to rai&s;e E&s;tates to them&s;elves by private Trade, Contracts, Pre&s;ents and Gifts, to hold parts of Ships, get|ting them into the Company's Service, furni&s;hing Com|manders with Nece&s;&s;aries for their Voyages, or by Loans on Bottomaree, at great Premiums, and many other ways, that tho&s;e skilful Men by being acquainted with the Com|pany's Affairs did di&s;cover. And can we &s;uppo&s;e our Di|rectors will be ignorant of tho&s;e private ways, or will be more kind and hone&s;t to us then they were to the Old Com|pany, if we continue them perpetual Directors, as they will be without a Rotation? for our Directors are Fle&s;h and Blood as well as tho&s;e Committee Men; nor have they in their private Capacities a fairer Reputation than tho&s;e Men had, and I dare &s;ay, give them the &s;ame opportunities, they will do the &s;ame things: for tho I do not think all Men are a|like, yet I believe the mo&s;t are &s;o.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="8">
<P>If there be any particular Men among&s;t them more u&s;e|ful and knowing than the re&s;t, doubtle&s;s we &s;hall hear with|out doors who they are, and always keep them in the ma|nagement till the fourth Year: but I would have them kept in for their Merits and de&s;erved Reputation, and not by the Art and Force of Cabals, Combinations and Confederacies, which oftentimes have kept in the wor&s;t as well as the be&s;t in other Societies. For none ever thought that all tho&s;e that are Directors in the Bank of <HI>England</HI> were the wi&s;e&s;t Men in that Company, or were cho&s;en &s;o many Years &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively for their Parts, Merits, or the greatne&s;s of their Ca&s;h; but they chanced to fall into the Confederacies, and their Names being known by rea&s;on of the publick Places they had &s;erved in, or the Gold Chains they had worn, were the chief Cau&s;e of their being cho&s;en by &s;o great a majority of Votes.</P>
<P>Now it is probable by a Rotation there would not be a|bove eight changed every Year, &s;o &s;ixteen of the old ones would remain till next Election; and by that time eight of the &s;ixteen go off, the fir&s;t eight new ones will have got &s;ome knowledg; and if they be Men of rea&s;onable Abilities and Application, they may be very perfect before the olde&s;t eight fall off: &s;o that we cannot ju&s;tly fear ever wanting &s;ome Men of Parts and Skill to direct the Company's Af|fairs.</P>
<P>But I do not &s;ee what great occa&s;ion we have for &s;uch ex|traordinary Men of Skill and Cunning, except we were to make War with the Great <HI>Mogul,</HI> or cheat the <HI>Indians.</HI> I hope we de&s;ign nothing but a fair hone&s;t Trade; and for the management of that it is always ob&s;erved, Men of re|fined Wit and Parts are not &s;o apt and proper as tho&s;e of a middle Capacity. There is no &s;uch Witchcraft in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, but any Merchant or other well vers'd in foreign Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s may be a fit Director: if it be not &s;o, I doubt our New Company will be but ill di|rected by &s;ome of the pre&s;ent Managers.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="8">
<P>We have had a late In&s;tance in the Management of the Affairs of the <HI>Antelope</HI> an Interloper, how &s;ome of tho&s;e Directors of the New Company who are thought to be &s;uch u&s;eful and extraordinary Men for di&s;patch of Bu&s;ine&s;s that they ought to be continued in that Station all their Lives, have skill and dexterity enough to perplex Accompts, and under the colour of various pretences to defer making of Dividends; and when they have been appointed, can &s;till find out fre&s;h excu&s;es to keep the Proprietors out of their Mony: whereas a Set of Men le&s;s famous for their Conduct, have been much more expeditious in dividing the Mony of the <HI>Scarborough</HI> and <HI>Rebecca.</HI> And I hope no body can with Rea&s;on expect &s;uch Men will be more punctual and le&s;s &s;elf|ended in a more publick Concern.</P>
<P>But pray let us examine into the particulars of this Trade, that we may the better di&s;cover the Difficulties of it. For if People will take things in gro&s;s, they may be ea&s;i|ly impos'd upon by the &s;pecious Arguments of there being a perfect nece&s;&s;ity to have &s;ome extraordinary Men always continued at the Helm of our Affairs, and the danger of changing them. And I think upon viewing the particulars, we &s;hall find nothing of &s;uch an extraordinary nature, but that Men of ordinary Capacities, that have been a Year or two acquainted with them may be able to manage.</P>
<P>For here at home their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to buy Goods and Pie|ces of Eight, and freight Ships, look after the Accompts, and corre&s;pond with People abroad; and for the manage|ment of the&s;e there are four di&s;tinct Committees. They have farther, to chu&s;e Factors and &s;ettle Factories and Sa|laries, draw up In&s;tructions for the Amba&s;&s;ador, provide Pre&s;ents proper to be &s;ent with him, give directions for &s;uch &s;ortments of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods as may be fit for our Market, and direct and manage the Sales of them at home.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e Heads all the Company's Bu&s;ine&s;s may be comprehended, and &s;ome of them are already done, and
<PB N="16" REF="9">may not need repeating the&s;e &s;everal Years; as the Form of a Charter-Party, Choice of Factors, Setling of Facto|ries and Salaries, In&s;tructions to the Amba&s;&s;ador, and Pre|&s;ents to go with him. Some changes and alterations in the&s;e things may be requi&s;ite hereafter, but there can be no great difficulty in them. And certainly if twenty four Men, mo&s;t of whom have no knowledg of the <HI>India</HI> Trade at all, and the skilfulle&s;t have been only concerned in three or four In|terlopers, are able to lay a good Foundation and Scheme for &s;o great a Trade, it cannot be thought difficult for &s;uch as &s;hall be hereafter cho&s;en, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e that have been in the management two Years together, and ha|ving their Scheme, Letters, and Orders all before them, to direct and carry it on to the Honour of the Nation and Ad|vantage of the Company. However we need not fear half tho&s;e inconveniencies and Di&s;advantages by tho&s;e Managers that we may ju&s;tly apprehend from a few arbitrary Men, when the Director&s;hips are entailed upon them, as they will be without a Rotation.</P>
<P>When &s;uch men are once fixt in their Stations by a re|jection of this By-law, you will &s;oon have them turn their thoughts upon private Trade, and find means to elude the Act of Parliament, Charter, and all our By-Laws. They will tell you they were bred Merchants, and men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and it is not worth their while to &s;pend their time in the Company's Service for a bare Salary of 150 <HI>l. per Annum</HI> (for &s;o much it is &s;aid they expect at lea&s;t) and it is unrea&s;onable that Gentlemen and others &s;hould follow their Plea&s;ures and Imployments, and yet reap equal Advantages in Trade with them that are bred to it, and &s;pend their time in it. Thus they will form to them&s;elves Rea&s;ons why little Perqui&s;ites be&s;ides their Salaries &s;hould be indulged them; and when they allow them&s;elves to go beyond their Salaries, they will have no bounds, nor can we tell where they will &s;top. Of this we have an example in the Old Company, where their Committee-men, under pretence of a lean and &s;canty Al|lowance
<PB N="17" REF="9">for their trouble, have thought it lawful for them to make all the Advantages they could, &s;eparate from that of the Joint Stock: and &s;o while the other Members &s;tar|ved, the Managers grew fat and full; not that I believe a large Salary will &s;ecure us from &s;ome Directors indirect Practices: Nature will have its Cour&s;e; and you may as well expect to &s;ecure your Lambs and Poultry from a ra|venous Fox, by giving him a plentiful Allowance, as your Stock by a large Salary to an uncon&s;cionable Director; for give the Fox as much as you will, if you do not keep him chained, he will be at his Game; it is his nature and can|not be cured.</P>
<P>A few perpetual Directors &s;hall have all our Servants in <HI>India</HI> to wor&s;hip them; and to make their Wor&s;hip accept|able, no Offerings or Oblations mu&s;t be &s;pared: At home all Applications and Addre&s;&s;es &s;hall be made to them; and as the Cu&s;tom is among&s;t us, none mu&s;t approach empty handed. The&s;e leading men mu&s;t furni&s;h the Captains, &s;ome with Oxen, others with Powder, others with Guns and Shot, others with Beer, Cordage, Iron-work, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that at their own Rates: but what is paid extraordinary by the Captains, the Company lo&s;es at la&s;t. The&s;e and innume|rable other mi&s;chiefs a thorow Rotation would in a great mea&s;ure prevent; and if I had all my E&s;tate in this Com|pany, I would rather chu&s;e and think it &s;afer to have a tho|row Rotation in three Years without any By-Laws, than the be&s;t By-Laws without any Change of Directors. But it is near two a Clock by my Watch, we &s;hall lo&s;e our <HI>Ex|change</HI> unle&s;s we leave off for this time: when we meet a|gain, I have &s;omewhat further to offer on this Subject.</P>

<P>YOur Servant Sir, I find you are punctual to your time; nor had I been le&s;s &s;o, but that I was &s;topt by one of our Directors in the Street: and by what he told me I per|ceive you need not trouble your &s;elf any further to an&s;wer my Arguments again&s;t the expediency of a Rotation; for he &s;aith that By-Law was rejected la&s;t night by the Com|mittee, and in&s;tead thereof, they have agreed that eight Directors &s;hall fall off every Year, not by way of Rotation, but as it is in the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> and by a late Regulati|on in the Old <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; &s;o that now &s;ixteen of the pre&s;ent Directors may be continued for Life. And yet I mu&s;t tell you we are very much di&s;plea&s;ed even with this By-Law, as it is moderated; for none of us are willing to lo&s;e our places, and &s;ome of us mu&s;t out, and perhaps it will not be ea&s;ie for us to get in again. And be&s;ides, we are afraid the General Court will confirm this becau&s;e of tho&s;e Precedents I have ju&s;t now mentioned; whereas a Rotation being a new Thing, and what People do not well under|&s;tand, we were con&s;ident by our Selves, our Friends and In|tere&s;t, to have got that rejected by the General Court. For we know when the Directors are unanimous, as they are in that matter, they can govern General Courts as they plea&s;e. And moreover, you have few in the Committee that are good Speakers; and tho&s;e that can talk we &s;hall blow them as peevi&s;h, &s;owr, ill-natur'd fellows, State-Reformers, never pleas'd with any thing but what they do them&s;elves, who made this &s;truggle for a Rotation, not that they be|liev'd it for the Intere&s;t and Safety of the Company, but to get them&s;elves into our Places. And when Men are once blown, what they &s;ay (tho never &s;o rea&s;onable and to the purpo&s;e) is little regarded. We have many friends and others that have mea&s;ures to keep with us upon various Ac|counts, that will concur with our Opinion without Examina|tion, and believe as we believe: that as we have prevailed to reject a Rotation by the Committee, &s;o we do not yet
<PB N="19" REF="10">wholly de&s;pair of getting this rejected by the General Court, and then we &s;hall be fixt for ever. The next Committee for By-Laws (if we ever think fit to have another) &s;hall be better modell'd, Men more in our Intere&s;t; for by that time we &s;hall know the humours and inclinations of Men better than we did when we made our Li&s;t for this Com|mittee: had we known you as we do now, the greate&s;t part of you &s;hould not have been in our Li&s;t, nor con&s;equently cho&s;en. We have &s;ome indeed among&s;t you that concur with us in every thing we propo&s;e or oppo&s;e, and it is &s;uch we mu&s;t chu&s;e hereafter.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had &s;everal other things to offer for the expediency of a Rotation; but &s;ince that Method is rejected by the Com|mittee, I &s;hall &s;ay little farther upon that Head at this time: yet I am very confident it will not be long before &s;uch a Ro|tation be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The Thing is now new, many have not heard of it, and others not con&s;ider'd it. But when the Members of the Company &s;hall duly weigh the Convenien|cies and Safety of it, as &s;ecuring us again&s;t the Corruption and ill Practices that the Managers of &s;uch Societies have u&s;ually fallen into, by being long continued in their Stations, it will &s;oon determine them to the Choice of this Method, rather than that which the Committee hath agreed upon. The falling off of eight yearly, tho not by Rotation, is a good &s;tep towards preventing the Mi&s;chiefs that are apt to grow where there is no Change at all; but it is an im|perfect Cure, and will leave us langui&s;hing. For &s;ixteen may, and probably mo&s;t of them will be continued for Life without a Rotation; whereas by a thorow Change in three Years all Combinations would be broke, and all undue Means of enriching them&s;elves di&s;covered and prevented: and when they have no ways left to make private Advanta|ges to them&s;elves, they will employ their Thoughts for the Intere&s;t and Profit of the joynt Concern, which are the on|ly things aimed at by this Method.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of leaving out eight Directors yearly by the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> and the Regulation in the Old <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="11">Company, was the &s;ame with what we propo&s;e by a Rota|tion: and if this will an&s;wer the End better, it ought not to be rejected for being New or wanting a Precedent. There was no Precedent for tho&s;e then, no more than for this now; &s;o the newne&s;s of the thing can be no good Rea&s;on again&s;t it. That was oppos'd as violently by tho&s;e Directors then, as this is now by Ours, and they kept it off till the Parliament undertook it: and had they not done &s;o, 'tis like it had never been done, nor ever one Director chang'd, except volunta|rily or by Death. Tho I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you that as there is not in the Bank of <HI>England</HI> one tenth part of the opportu|nities of getting Mony by indirect Means as there is in this Company, &s;o there is not that occa&s;ion there for a Rotation of their Directors. It &s;eems a little &s;trange that abundance of the Members and others &s;hould &s;ee good Rea&s;on for a Rotation, and yet not one Director &s;hould be of that Opini|nion, but unanimou&s;ly oppo&s;e it: one would conclude hence that there is &s;omething be&s;ides Rea&s;on governs their Judg|ments, for I dare &s;ay, they are not &s;o unanimous in other Matters where their Intere&s;t is not concerned.</P>
<P>What you tell me of modelling the next Committee for By-Laws, makes me dread a continuance of the &s;ame Di|rectors: for &s;uch a Set will make all our Committees both for By-Laws and tho&s;e to audit the Company's Accompts and every thing el&s;e. And what Good we may expect from Men of their own chu&s;ing, after they perfectly know them, is very ea&s;ie to gue&s;s: for it is amazing to &s;ee Committee Men agree exactly with the Directors in every Vote, and di&s;|&s;ent in none; it looks like an implicit Faith, and that they are guided by other Mens Rea&s;on rather than their own.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think we are now over the matter of a Rotation, and its younger Brother, the leaving out of eight, which we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the determination of a General Court. Pray let us con&s;ider another thing that is prepared for a By-Law (which I hear found no oppo&s;ition by any in the Com|mittee) And that is, that no Officer or Servant of the Com|pany &s;hall take directly or indirectly any Fee or Reward
<PB N="21" REF="11">what&s;oever for any Service in the Company, but what &s;hall be allowed by the Court of Directors. You have herein cer|tainly done well, and what will plea&s;e all the Members, and remedy tho&s;e Evils that are in mo&s;t Companies, and almo&s;t all Offices in <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The By-Law you &s;peak of concerning the Company's Servants will doubtle&s;s be agreeable to every one. You &s;ay we have certainly done well, and I mu&s;t tell you we would have done better if we could: for when the By-Law you la&s;t mentioned was agreed on, it was moved, that there might be al&s;o another By-Law to re&s;train the Directors from receiving any Pre&s;ents, Gifts or Rewards, be&s;ides their Salaries: and had tho&s;e Directors that were then pre&s;ent &s;econded that Motion, it would have look'd hone&s;t and gene|rous; but in&s;tead of that they put it off with a Joke. And to be plain with you, I think there is more Rea&s;on for the one than the other, by how much greater Temptations the Directors will have than their Servants: their Servants can only accommodate Men in trifling matters, compar'd to tho&s;e the Directors may do. And I dare &s;ay the Directors were more careful and cautious, and made better enquiry be|fore they cho&s;e their Servants, than we did when we cho&s;e them. I would allow them generous Salaries to reward them for their Care, Trouble and Time; but they &s;hould not be allowed to receive any Pre&s;ents or Gifts from Com|manders of Ships, Factors, or any body el&s;e concerned with the Company.</P>
<P N="1">1. And here let me give you the words of a late Author on this Subject we are upon. <Q REND="inline">The taking of a Bribe or Gratuity &s;hould be puni&s;hed with as &s;evere Penalties as the defrauding the State. Let Men have &s;ufficient Salaries, and exceed them at their Peril. It is a di&s;honour to a Govern|ment that its Officers &s;hould live of Benevolence, as it ought to beinfamous to Officers to di&s;honour the Publick by being twice paid for the &s;ame Bu&s;ine&s;s. But to be paid and not to do Bu&s;ine&s;s is rank oppre&s;&s;ion. Di&s;patch is a great and
<PB N="22" REF="12">good Quality in an Officer, where Duty not Gain excites it: but of this many make their private Market and over|plus to their Wages. Thus the Salary is for doing, and the Bribe for di&s;patching the Bu&s;ine&s;s: as if Bu&s;ine&s;s could be done before it were di&s;patched, or what ought to be done ought not to be di&s;patched; or they were to be paid a|part, one by the Government, t'other by the Party. Di&s;patch is as much the Duty of an Officer as Doing.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. A Pre&s;ent or a Gift to any Per&s;on in a publick Tru&s;t made by a Per&s;on concerned in tho&s;e Affairs, or that Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of which he hath the Management, I reckon a plain direct Bribe, and as &s;uch will blind their Eyes that receive them. The Sacred Scriptures confirm this Truth, and tell us, <HI>Thou &s;halt take no Gift, for the Gift hlindeth the Wi&s;e, and perver|teth the words of the Righteous.</HI> Solomon &s;aith, <HI>A Gift is as a pretious Stone in the Eyes of him that hath it; whither &s;oever it turneth it pro&s;pereth. Awicked Man taketh a Gift out of the bo|&s;om to pervert the ways of Judgment.</HI> And again, <HI>A Man's Gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great Men. Many will entreat the favour of the Prince, and every Man is a friend to him that giveth Gifts.</HI> And again further, <HI>A Gift in &s;ecret pacifieth Anger, and a Reward in the bo&s;om &s;trong Wrath. The King by Judgment &s;tabli&s;heth the Land: But he that recei|veth Gifts overthroweth it.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>This would be a pretty &s;evere Law indeed to tie us up from taking of Gifts: Who would be a Director on tho&s;e Terms? If a Commander &s;hould &s;end me a Chine of Beef, or a few Marrow-Bones, I mu&s;t refu&s;e them, le&s;t it be inter|preted a Bribe. Every Man that is a Director will expect &s;ome &s;mall Perqui&s;ites be&s;ides his Salary; otherwi&s;e who would have given five hundred pound to be continued Com|mittee Man in the Old <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company for the &s;ake of a trifling Allowance every time they gave their attendance? So that &s;mall matters ought to be indulged us, &s;ince 'tis a common Practice, and cannot hurt the Company becau&s;e other Men pay for it.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="23" REF="12">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Man will know on what Terms he mu&s;t hold his Director&s;hip; and if he di&s;like them, he need not accept of it, but leave it to tho&s;e that will: &s;o there will be no hard|&s;hip put upon any Man when he knows the Conditions be|fore hand. And doubtle&s;s no body will think him fit to be a Director that accepts of it, and is not contented with his bare Salary, and the honour of the Place. But it is odd to talk of indulging &s;mall Perqui&s;ites, little Gifts, and Bribes; as if the taking a &s;mall Bribe were not a Crime: the taking of the lea&s;t is doubtle&s;s &s;o, and as &s;uch ought not to be al|lowed. We may as well permit Men to rob as far as five or ten &s;hillings, but no higher, and &s;ay the &s;mallne&s;s of the Sum renders it lawful: whereas all that can be &s;aid for it is, that the incon&s;iderablene&s;s of the Robbery doth extenuate, but not legitimate the Fact. Be&s;ides, it may be ju&s;tly feared, that tho&s;e who allow them&s;elves a liberty to &s;teal five or ten &s;hillings, will make no Con&s;cience of taking a larger Sum when they have an opportunity to do it. If we &s;hould allow them to accept of &s;mall things, pray how &s;hall we &s;et them exact Bounds beyond which they are not to pa&s;s? I am afraid &s;uch a Liberty would find no bounds, and can no more be re&s;trained, than Water that breaks down the Banks, which will overflow as well where we would not, as where we are willing it &s;hould.</P>
<P>We have heard of Managers in another Company, who have not contented them&s;elves with Marrow-Bones, China-Ware, Tea, and other little Rarities; but have gone as high as a Bale of Muzlin of a great Value: and in the Pocket-Book of the late Captain of the &mdash; there was found written, <HI>Given to &s;uch a Committee Man three hundred and fif|ty pound to hold one &s;ixteenth of my Ship, to another two hundred and fifty pound to hold &s;uch a Part, and to a third, one hundred and fifty pound to hold one two and thirtieth part.</HI> Thus you &s;ee, where Men have liberty, they will not know where to &s;top. Weak People may fancy that the Company lo&s;t nothing by what the Captain gave the Committee Men, becau&s;e it went
<PB N="24" REF="13">immediately out of his pocket, and not out of the Compa|ny's: but doubtle&s;s the Captain did not part with his Mony for Air; he laid it out to good Advantage, and that at the long run the Company paid for, and not the Commit|tee Men who received it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have prepared another By-Law; That once a Year a Committee of five, whereof three to make a <HI>Quo|rum,</HI> &s;hall be cho&s;en by the General Court to audit the Ac|compts, and in&s;pect the Proceedings of the Company; and if they find any thing ami&s;s, to report it to the next Ge|neral Court. This is a By-Law we do extreamly di&s;ap|prove; it looks like the effect of Jealou&s;ie, and will have ill con&s;equences, by betraying the Secrets of the Company to all the World: and &s;ome things may be of that nature, that the di&s;clo&s;ing of them might be very prejudicial to the Affairs of the Company. Be&s;ides, it looks very unkind, while we have done no unju&s;tifiable Action, but are labou|ring day and night for your Service, that you &s;hould make this di&s;tru&s;tful Law, which it had been time enough to have done when you had known us do &s;omething ami&s;s: and moreover, we are under an Oath which ties us to do you Ju&s;tice, and is alone a &s;ufficient Security.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>It &s;eems &s;trange to me, and doubtle&s;s will do &s;o to others, that the Directors do &s;o ea&s;ily con&s;ent to all By-Laws wherein their Director&s;hips or private Advantages are not concerned, and at the &s;ame time &s;hould &s;o violently op|po&s;e all By-Laws that would hinder them from doing us wrong, and di&s;cover them when they do &s;o. If they in|tend to do nothing ami&s;s, why are they afraid of Laws that can hurt none but evil Doers? Men that are hone&s;t, and re|&s;olve to continue &s;o, need neither fear nor be concerned, what &s;evere Laws &s;oever are made to puni&s;h tho&s;e that are otherwi&s;e. If a Law was preparing to inflict even Capital Puni&s;hment on &s;uch as &s;hould take a Bribe, why &s;hould I op|po&s;e it except I intended to take one my &s;elf? For however a Law of this Nature may be, it can puni&s;h none but wil|ful
<PB N="25" REF="13">Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ours of it, and &s;uch will not de&s;erve pity, for none can be &s;urpriz'd and &s;o tran&s;gre&s;s ignorantly or inad|vertently; and it is &s;uch only that merit Compa&s;&s;ion, and Relaxation of a &s;evere Law.</P>
<P>What need you fear an In&s;pection of your Accompts and Proceedings, if they be ju&s;t and fair? for then it will be for your Advantage to have the World know they are &s;o, whereas without &s;uch an In&s;pection you may lie under &s;u&s;|picion and an ill Character, when you de&s;erve it not; &s;o that methinks for your own Reputation, even you your &s;elves &s;hould de&s;ire &s;uch a By-Law. And I hope it cannot be call'd Jealou&s;ie in us to believe you are Men like your neigh|bours. We have heard of ill things frequently done by Per&s;ons in other publick Tru&s;ts, and why then is it &s;o un|pardonable in us, to think that it is po&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t for &s;ome of you to do &s;o too, when you are under the &s;ame Temptations? We do this by way of Precaution and for Prevention, and not becau&s;e we &s;u&s;pect or know you to be ill Men already. To let this By-Law alone till you have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, would be both imprudent in us, and un&s;afe for you: for Laws and the Fear of Detection and Puni&s;h|ment keep &s;ome Men in the right way, whom Opportu|nity and Temptation would otherwi&s;e lead a&s;ide. As to the Oath you mentioned; I confe&s;s an Oath is &s;o &s;acred a Thing, that there would need no &s;tronger Tye upon a truly con&s;cientious Man; but taking Men in general as they are, there needs &s;ome additional Security, and it is the declared Opinion of one of our eminente&s;t Directors, <HI>That one Bond is worth fifty Oaths.</HI></P>
<P>But then you &s;ay, this Committee will betray the Secrets of the Company, and ill Con&s;equences will attend it. I hope both the Directors and the General Court will endea|vour to chu&s;e &s;uch Men for that Committee as have a fair Reputation for Hone&s;ty and Di&s;cretion, and who&s;e Intere&s;t it will be to keep all nece&s;&s;ary Secrets of the Company. If twenty four Directors can keep a Secret, certainly five

<P>There is I hear another ill-natur'd By-Law prepared, which is, that after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1699, no Director &s;hall be concerned as an Owner in any Ships they hire for the Com|pany, &s;o that if I have a Part of a Ship, &s;he cannot &s;erve the Company becau&s;e I am a Part-Owner: which is a cruel hard&s;hip upon the Directors, and may occa&s;ion the want of proper Ships to &s;erve the Company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were cho&s;en to prepare &s;uch By-Laws as we judg|ed for the Safety and Advantage of the Company, &s;o that our Bu&s;ine&s;s is to pur&s;ue tho&s;e Ends, and not to con&s;ult the Profit and Conveniences of any particular Directors or Members of it. Their Intere&s;t is not our Care to provide for, where it may interfere with that of the Society, as doubtle&s;s &s;uch a Liberty would do: for if Directors might hire their own Ships, or &s;uch as they are Part-Owners of, adju&s;t their Damages, Demurrages, Averages, and allow the Commanders Licences to trade, we may expect they will be more favourable to their own Intere&s;t than that of the Company, by how much the one is nearer to them than the other. And when Directors may freight their own Ships, any Tool they have, will be adjudged fit for our Ser|vice:
<PB N="27" REF="14">whereas when they are not concern'd them&s;elves, and &s;o not bya&s;s'd by their Intere&s;t, they will not fail to be curious and nice in their Choice, and we &s;hall be &s;ure to have the be&s;t and propere&s;t Ships the Kingdom affords, and upon the be&s;t Terms.</P>
<P>To let the Directors be both Buyers and Sellers of their own Commodities, (and letting and hiring their own Ships is the &s;ame thing) would be an unaccountable folly in us; and I hope the lo&s;s and inconveniences the Old Company have &s;uffered by that Liberty, will be a &s;ufficient warning to us to avoid the &s;ame Errour.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent there are not many of our Directors con|cern'd in &s;uch Shipping as is proper for the <HI>India</HI> Trade; therefore this By-Law can be only an Inconvenience to a few; and why we &s;hould, for the Advantage of five or &s;ix Directors, neglect the making of a Law that will for ever &s;ecure the Company from many mi&s;chiefs, which may at|tend us by wanting &s;uch a Law, is what I cannot under&s;tand; be&s;ides, it will be le&s;s prejudicial to the Directors, and ea&s;ier obtain'd, to make &s;uch a By-Law now, while they are little concern'd in Shipping, than hereafter; when by &s;uch a Li|berty their Concern in it is become much greater. And, without pretending to a Spirit of Prophecy, I will affirm, that before we are &s;ix Months older, tho&s;e Directors who are not concern'd in the Shipping you &s;hall freight for this Sea&s;on, will not have &s;uch an aver&s;ion to this By-Law as they now &s;eem to have.</P>
<P>If any Director have a &s;mall Part of a Ship that is fit for the <HI>India</HI> Trade, which by this Law cannot &s;erve the Company till that Director hath &s;old his Part, the re&s;t of the Owners will readily buy it, almo&s;t on his own Terms, to make her free for the Company's Service, &s;o that in that Ca&s;e which is thought the harde&s;t, the Director can &s;uffer no Lo&s;s, but will be rather a Gainer: But if his Part be very large, every one may gue&s;s how that will bya&s;s him to the Company's Prejudice.</P>
<PB N="28" REF="15">
<P>It may be &s;aid, tho&s;e Directors that are not concern'd in Shipping may hire Ships, adju&s;t Damages, Demurrages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But every body knows how apt tho&s;e that &s;it at the &s;ame Board are to favour one another, &s;o that &s;uch a Method will but deceive us, and can be no Security to the Com|pany; be&s;ides, tho&s;e Directors that have not been con|cern'd in Shipping, will want Skill and Experience to ma|nage tho&s;e Affairs, and cannot be thought &s;o proper to compo&s;e a Committee of Shipping, as others that have been long acquainted with the nature of it.</P>
<P>And while I am &s;peaking of Committees, let me ob&s;erve to you, that a By-Law for a Change or Rotation among&s;t the &s;everal Committees as well as among&s;t the Directors at the Annual Election, would in my Opinion be of great Advantage and Security to the Company, both for pre|venting Corruption, and giving each Director an oppor|tunity to be acquainted with all the Affairs of the Compa|ny; whereas by continuing the &s;ame Committees, they will be almo&s;t Strangers to all other Bu&s;ine&s;s but that under their particular management.</P>
<P>We have liberty by our Charter to make what By-Laws we plea&s;e for our Security and good Government; and &s;ince we have &s;een tho&s;e Rocks and Sands on which the Old Company have &s;plit, we &s;hall be extreamly wanting to our &s;elves and our Po&s;terity, if we do not provide &s;ufficiently again&s;t them, but &s;uffer our &s;elves to be bubled out of our Safety and Sen&s;es, by Sophi&s;try and fal&s;e Rea&s;oning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;eem mighty warm for your By-Laws, as if they were &s;o great a Security to the Company again&s;t the ill Practices of the Directors: whereas if we were ill Men, it would require no great thought or cunning to elude the force of mo&s;t of them, and more particularly your By-Law about Shipping and that again&s;t receiving Gifts or Bribes, as you call them: therefore when all is done you mu&s;t tru&s;t to our hone&s;ty.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;enlible there is a great deal of Truth in what
<PB N="29" REF="15">you now &s;ay; yet it is no good Argument again&s;t having By-Laws, becau&s;e ill Men may elude them; they will how|ever be &s;ome Awe and Re&s;traint upon them (if ever we &s;hould have &s;uch Directors) le&s;t they &s;hould be di&s;cover'd. But if By-Laws cannot re&s;train them, or &s;ecure us; nor Mens Integrity be intirely depended upon, by rea&s;on of the general Corruption of Mankind, then, as I &s;aid before, (with which I will conclude) The be&s;t and only good Secu|rity we can have again&s;t the evil Practices of bad Men, and &s;ubjecting our be&s;t Men to Temptations, will be a fre|quent change of Hands, by a thorow Rotation of the Di|rectors in the &s;pace of three Years. For if the Director|&s;hip be but of a &s;hort continuance, and none enjoy it above three Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, they cannot have time to form and accompli&s;h private De&s;igns before they be remo|ved; for tho&s;e that &s;ucceed them will di&s;cover their In|trigues, and break all their Mea&s;ures. And (which may be of no &s;mall Advantage and Security to us) Men will be at a lo&s;s where to place their Gifts, when the Power and op|portunity of recompencing them, is by this means become &s;o precarious and uncertain.</P>
