<P>TO Their <HI>Maje&s;ties</HI> is mo&s;t Humbly pre&s;ented The&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es of <HI>Repentance,</HI> exten|ding to <HI>National Reformation,</HI> in order to the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</HI> Into which are in&s;erted Con&s;iderations upon the late <HI>Earthquake</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and the later Motion of the Earth in <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and other Parts in the Na|tion,
<PB REF="3"> and beyond the Seas: And all this on greate&s;t Right and Due.

Who, as Prote&s;tant Princes, are Intere&s;t|ed in the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t?</HI> of which the <HI>Prote&s;tation</HI> again&s;t <HI>Papal</HI> and <HI>Antichri&s;tian Abo|minations,</HI> and <HI>U&s;urpations,</HI> was a Preparation; even for that <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t;</HI> tho at the di&s;tance of <HI>180</HI> Years, &s;tyled in <HI>Prophecy, Half Time,</HI> near expi|ring into the Succe&s;&s;ion of that <HI>Kingdom;</HI> when <HI>Reformed Princes,</HI> truly &s;o, &s;hall not lo&s;e, but highly gain in Glory; Who,
<PB REF="3"> as Good, and, indeed Gracious Princes, are &s;o deeply affected in publick Judgments, unhappy Re|volutions; or general Mercies and happy Revolutions; foreboded by <HI>Earthquakes</HI> or Gentle Moves of the Earth? For they are <HI>Nur|&s;ing Fathers</HI> and <HI>Nur&s;ing Mo|thers</HI> of their People. And of what Princes can we hope or promi&s;e our &s;elves better than of their &s;o &V;nited <HI>Maje&s;ties,</HI> Two-One in True Religion? As there|fore the <HI>Supream Maje&s;ty</HI> was pleas'd to give particular Dire|ctions to Them&s;elves of tho&s;e <HI>Tremblings</HI> of <HI>Earth;</HI> whether for Judgment and Repentance; or for Mercy; in their <HI>Port</HI> in

<PB REF="4"> Mini&s;try,</HI> is, I hope, more immediately committed to them by Chri&s;t; wherein being near to Chri&s;t; as in their National <HI>Epi&s;copacy</HI> to their <HI>Maje&s;ties;</HI> they can, and I doubt not, will Repre&s;ent to them what is accor|ding to his Go&s;pel by this Mi|ni&s;tration.

<P>WE live in an Age, where|in Names and Profe&s;&s;i|ons are many Thou&s;ands; and ten Thou&s;ands are di&s;tingui&s;hed thereby, every one &s;aying, <HI>Lo, here is Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Lo, there; that thou ha&s;t a Name, that thou live&s;t,</HI> may be &s;aid to the National Church, and to all the Di&s;&s;enting Churches a|mong us; the <HI>Temple,</HI> the <HI>Tem|ple,</HI> &s;aith the one, and &s;aith the o|ther; yet may it not be &s;aid to the mo&s;t of the&s;e Churches; <HI>But thou
<PB REF="6"> art dead, be watchful</HI> and <HI>&s;trengthen the things, that re|main, that are ready to Dye,</HI> Rev. <HI>3.2, 3, 4.</HI> God hath (I am per|&s;waded) a <HI>few Names</HI> in all, and every the &s;aid Churches, <HI>who have not defiled their Garments,</HI> but do indeed repent, and turn to the Lord; who are born <HI>not of Fle&s;h, nor of Blood, nor of the will of man, but of God;</HI> &s;uch to whom the <HI>kindne&s;s and love of God our Saviour hath appeared,</HI> not <HI>by works of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which they <HI>have done,</HI> but according <HI>to his mercy</HI> he hath <HI>&s;aved</HI> them by the <HI>wa&s;hing of Regeneration,</HI> and <HI>renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and for others, let them be of the lowe&s;t, or of the highe&s;t form, &s;uch that have made the fir&s;t &s;tep to
<PB REF="6"> Reformation, or higher and greater &s;teps thereto; they are but the leaves of the <HI>Fig Treee</HI> that is <HI>cur&s;ed</HI> of Chri&s;t, and &s;hall <HI>&s;oon wither a|way:</HI> It is no matter what name you have (I would there were not any Name among us but Chri&s;tian); It is the Nature and Power of Chri&s;tiani|ty: What is the Chaff to the Wheat? It is &s;aid in the Phrophe&s;ies of <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> and <HI>Micah,</HI> that the <HI>Mountain</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Hou&s;e</HI> &s;hall be <HI>exalted to the top of the Mountains,</HI> and <HI>all Nations</HI> &s;hall <HI>flow unto it;</HI> I do not think by <HI>Mountain</HI> in the&s;e places is meant any one particular Church, by what Name &s;oever they be dignified or di&s;tingui&s;hed: But the true Living, Mi&s;tick and Catho|lick Church; &s;uch, who having been in the Apo&s;tacy, with others, do Repent,
<PB REF="7"> and turn to the Lord; and that you may the better know them, you have the&s;e following Di&s;cour&s;es to help you in &s;o great a work; &s;ome De&s;pi&s;e this great Grace, and &s;tumble at this mighty work of God upon the Heart, as too high, too hard, and too difficult a work; but God hath his <HI>Fire in Zion,</HI> and his <HI>Furnace</HI> in <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI> and he will <HI>throwly purge his Floor:</HI> There mu&s;t be a <HI>cut|ting off a right Hand, a pluck|ing out a right Eye;</HI> and it is better <HI>going to Heaven</HI> with <HI>one Eye,</HI> and with <HI>one Hand, maimed</HI> and <HI>Halt,</HI> than <HI>to go to Hell with both.</HI> Others &s;ay, Repentance is a legal work, fit only for old Te&s;ta|ment Saints; There is indeed a &s;or|row, a rapentance that <HI>worketh Death;</HI> but the Repentance here
<PB REF="7"> called for, and exhorted to, is &s;uch, <HI>that is never to be Repented of;</HI> That which brings the Soul poor and naked, trembling, and melting to Chri&s;t, the Prince and Saviour, that gives Repentance to <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and For|givene&s;s of Sins; And ble&s;&s;ed you: For ever Ble&s;&s;ed are they, who&s;e <HI>&s;ins are forgiven, and who&s;e Iniqui|ties are pardoned;</HI> here are the Rivers of the <HI>Waters of Life,</HI> the Tree in the mid&s;t of the <HI>Paradice of God;</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t thus Revealed, and thus received, and heartily em|braced, will put an end to all differen|cies, debates and controver&s;ies; He that hath this <HI>Anointing</HI> from a|bove; this <HI>well of Life &s;pringing up in him unto Everla&s;ting Life;</HI> will not <HI>Ble&s;s</HI> him&s;elf in an <HI>Idol,</HI> nor be plea&s;ed with any pompous Wor|&s;hip,
<PB REF="8"> knowing the <HI>King's Daught|er is all glorious within,</HI> and <HI>Cir|cumci&s;ion</HI> is <HI>that of the Heart;</HI> he knows not, nor acknowledges any, as <HI>Lords, over God's Heritage;</HI> but is a&s;&s;ured, That the <HI>Son of Man</HI> came not to be <HI>Mini&s;ter'd</HI> to, but to <HI>Mini&s;ter.</HI> The things contained herein are the <HI>true &s;ayings of God,</HI> according to the Holy Scriptures, making the <HI>man of God perfect, throughly furni&s;hed to every good work;</HI> Did all men that have the worthy Name of Chri&s;tian, profe&s;s, and practi&s;e, what is herein pre&s;&s;ed to, and called for, we &s;hould &s;ee <HI>Jeru&s;alem a quiet Habitati|on, a &s;ure Dwelling Place;</HI> for none &s;hall then indeed harm us, if we are followers of that which is good: Here are plain Go&s;pel Truths, that
<PB REF="8"> who&s;oever &s;tumbles thereat, it is, be|cau&s;e Chri&s;t is to him a <HI>&s;tumbling &s;tone,</HI> and <HI>rock of offence;</HI> and yet mi&s;terious and deep, that one can never find the bottom; a River that men may &s;wim in: O Chri&s;tian! when|ever thou art &s;o conver&s;ant in the&s;e things, let thy <HI>profiting appear to all men; let the Dead bury the Dead;</HI> but <HI>go thou and follow Chri&s;t,</HI> as &s;oon as ever he calls thee; Never go to thy <HI>Father's Hou&s;e,</HI> and bid them there <HI>farewel;</HI> go to Chri&s;t, when&s;oever in the Go&s;pel he calls thee, or &s;peaks to thee by any private whi&s;pering; Go in all thy rags; &s;ay with the <HI>Prodigal,</HI> Tho I have &s;pent all upon <HI>Harlots,</HI> and am Starving, having fed upon <HI>Husks; I know in my Father's Hou&s;e,</HI> there is <HI>Bread enough, and to
<PB REF="9"> &s;pare,</HI> and here I peri&s;h with hun|ger; <HI>I will ari&s;e, and go to my Father, and will &s;ay unto him, Father I have &s;inned again&s;t Heaven, and before thee; yet Take me into thy Family, tho I be but as one of thy Hired Servants:</HI> To whom the Father will &s;ay; Don't &s;tand Doubting, come in, come in to my Hou&s;e, <HI>bring forth the be&s;t Robe and put it on him,</HI> &amp;c. I think no|thing too good for thee (my Son) now thou art returned, not a word what thou ha&s;t been, now thou art returned, I will receive thee; tho thou hast not a penny in thy Pur&s;e, nor any good quality in thee, but this thy coming back to me; Thou mu&s;t &s;tarve if thou keep wandring from thy <HI>Father's Hou&s;e;</HI> If I
<PB REF="9"> don't feed thee, thou peri&s;he&s;t; thou ha&s;t be-thought thy &s;elf at la&s;t, and art come home; &s;tand not at the door any longer &s;tarving in the cold, and for hunger; Away, Away, with thy provious Di&s;po&s;itions, and good qualifications before coming Welcome, Welcome, come in, come in, do not &s;tand at the door, I am glad thou art come; Who ever thought to have &s;een thee returning again?

<HEAD>To the mo&s;t Reverend, THE EPISCOPACY OF THE Church of <HI>ENGLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Do not arrogate to my &s;elf <HI>(Mo&s;t Reverend in our Lord)</HI> in Pre&s;ent|ing to your Hands this following Di&s;cour&s;e, to offer you any thing but what you have before receiv'd from the mo&s;t <HI>Excellent Ma&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Teacher,</HI> the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> in the
<PB REF="12"> <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and <HI>Word of God;</HI> Given by the <HI>Great High Prie&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Apo&s;tle of our Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> that <HI>One Shepherd,</HI> the <HI>Chief Shepherd,</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop of our Souls, Chri&s;t Je&s;us;</HI> and what <HI>you your &s;elves</HI> have often, I have greate&s;t Rea|&s;on to hope, and believe, Di&s;|cours'd, with cleare&s;t <HI>Evidence</HI> to the <HI>Under&s;tandings,</HI> and <HI>Convi|ctions upon the Con&s;ciences</HI> of them, that heard you.</P>
<P>This notwith&s;tanding I have very great Rea&s;ons, for ma|king <HI>this Humble&s;t Offerture</HI> to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. That by di&s;cour&s;ing and arguing a point &s;o acknow|ledgly Great, &s;o Fundamental and E&s;&s;ential, not only to Chri|&s;tianity,
<PB REF="12"> but to Natural Religi|on, and all Morality: If it &s;hall be acceptable to you, as I can|not but tru&s;t it will, becau&s;e it is &s;o agreeable to Scripture; I may reconcile my &s;elf to your more, not only Favour|able, but Deep <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> in <HI>&s;o great Points</HI> of <HI>the &s;ure Word of Prophecy,</HI> as I have hereto|fore pre&s;ented to you; and have made &s;ome Reference unto, in this very Doctrine of Repentance, as mo&s;t Connatu|ral to it.</P>
<P>For though I know there is a Difference between &s;uch a plain, and unconte&s;table Truth of Scripture, as Repentance is; and what lies in the darker
<PB REF="13"> Folds and Plaits of Scripture, in the <HI>Hieroglyphick Figures,</HI> and <HI>Prophetical Numbers</HI> of it; and it may &s;eem therefore <HI>impo&s;&s;i|ble,</HI> or <HI>highly improbable,</HI> that <HI>I e&s;pecially</HI> &s;hould attain <HI>the Cer|tainty of the Words of Truth,</HI> to <HI>an&s;wer</HI> and <HI>apologize the Words of Truth,</HI> in <HI>the great dependencies of Prophecy, to them that &s;end to me for them.</HI></P>
<P>But, as it is well urged a|gain&s;t the <HI>enemies of the Natu|ral Religion,</HI> as well as <HI>Revealed;</HI> that though there cannot be <HI>Mathematical Demon&s;tration</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Great Truths,</HI> as of <HI>Eu|clid</HI>'s <HI>Propo&s;itions;</HI> yet there may be <HI>as Convictive Proofs,</HI> in their kind, and <HI>as &s;atisfactory to
<PB REF="13"> true Under&s;tanding:</HI> Even &s;o I affirm, that <HI>the Prophetick Ima|ges, and Numbers,</HI> if they are <HI>attently eyed,</HI> and <HI>compared,</HI> may be as certainly A&s;&s;ur'd; and In|tellectual <HI>enquiries</HI> even <HI>&s;atia|ted</HI> with <HI>the evidence</HI> of them; Though they are not under &s;uch Proofs, as the plain Do|ctrines and Precepts of <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> yet by &s;uch a <HI>Probation,</HI> as is mo&s;t proper to them, they are certain in their <HI>kind:</HI> As the <HI>proof</HI> of &s;o plain a point in its kind, as <HI>Repentance</HI> is, is as cer|tain in its kind, as the <HI>proof</HI> of <HI>Natural Religion,</HI> in its <HI>Kind;</HI> which is as certain, as a <HI>Mathe|matick Propo&s;ition,</HI> in its kind: So &s;ure is <HI>Prophecy:</HI> In the <HI>Good|ne&s;s
<PB REF="14"> of our Creator,</HI> and <HI>Mediator;</HI> in <HI>giving, and &s;u&s;taining</HI> our <HI>Faculties</HI> in the true u&s;e of them&s;elves; &s;o &s;ure are <HI>each of the&s;e;</HI> and <HI>each of them,</HI> in their kind, as &s;ure the one, as the other; even the <HI>Word of Prophecy,</HI> &s;ure as any.</P>
<P>For as I have often &s;aid, e|ven the&s;e <HI>Enigmatical parts of Scripture,</HI> are mo&s;t <HI>certainly,</HI> as will be <HI>ea&s;ily allowed,</HI> infallibly true in their own &s;en&s;e: They are therefore to be under|&s;tood; For &s;o is all Truth: They are Revealed; and therefore it is intended by God, they <HI>&s;hould be under&s;tood.</HI> If to <HI>be under&s;tood,</HI> they may <HI>be known, they are truly under&s;tood,</HI> by the <HI>Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s to ones &s;elf</HI> of
<PB REF="14"> <HI>the evidence</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Critierions,</HI> and <HI>Marks of Truth,</HI> mo&s;t <HI>Con|natural to them;</HI> that <HI>All Parts</HI> an&s;wer one to another; that they an&s;wer to what mu&s;t be mo&s;t <HI>apparently</HI> the <HI>main Scope and Intention</HI> of the <HI>whole;</HI> and that <HI>Hi&s;torical Matter of Fact</HI> an&s;wers all along; which makes <HI>all certain;</HI> As he that hath <HI>a Key to a Cyphar,</HI> or to <HI>Hi|&s;tory</HI> in <HI>Picture</HI> or <HI>Emblem, may be a&s;&s;ur'd he hath it, when he</HI> Finds all agree, one part with ano|ther; and the whole with what was rea&s;onable to be expected, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>De&s;ign.</HI></P>
<P>And if any one &s;hould &s;ay, <HI>Why &s;hould this be Revealed to me
<PB REF="15"> &s;o unworthy; &s;o little prepared with all the Advantages of Learning and Books.</HI></P>
<P>I do mo&s;t humbly <HI>Acknow|ledg</HI> the <HI>Dint</HI> of this <HI>Prejudice;</HI> and can only <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> as I have done <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">: So it plea&s;ed him, and to <HI>humble</HI> me to lowe&s;t <HI>Aba&s;ement</HI> (How|ever I mo&s;t <HI>humbly Confe&s;s</HI> wholly by my own <HI>&s;in,</HI> and <HI>guilt</HI>) as in a &s;olitary <HI>Patmos</HI> for it; And I cannot but <HI>hope,</HI> now I look upon my <HI>Te&s;ti|mony</HI> as near <HI>Fini&s;hed,</HI> and that things are ju&s;t now upon their <HI>Complement,</HI> he may be pleas'd al&s;o to <HI>Di&s;confine</HI> me when his <HI>Witne&s;&s;es</HI> are &s;o near, <HI>Comming out of their

<P>THERE is no more Univer&s;al Notion in the Soul of Man in tho&s;e Things, wherein he hath to do with God, or even with Man, or with Him&s;elf, then to Repent; that is, to be &s;orry for what he hath done Ami&s;s, and wherein he hath Offended: and to Re&s;olve, and Promi&s;e to Amend, and to do the Evil he hath done, no more; It is fitted as a great In&s;trument of Reconciliation, and a &s;econd &s;tate of Innocency; a Re&s;erve after the Ruin and Shipwrack of our Fir&s;t Innocency, a Remedy, a Reparation after, the fir&s;t Advantages of doing well, are lo&s;t; And it is the infinite Grace of God in a
<PB N="2" REF="20"> Mediator, that there is &s;uch a Notion in the World; It pre&s;erves it from being a Hell in regard either of the extremity, and utmo&s;t Rages of Wickedne&s;s; or of the Horrors, and Fury of De&s;pair. It is the infinite Grace of God in a Redeemer, That there is a <HI>Place of Repentance,</HI> as the Apo&s;tle calls it, <HI>Heb.</HI> 12. that is, place, and room for it in mans Heart, and that there is place for it in the Acceptance of God; that God does not &s;corn, and utterly reject it, again&s;t him, that hath once &s;inned; That he is not inexorable, and not to be intreated concerning it; For how woful, and even Helli&s;hly Mi&s;erable would man be without it? That the Nature of Man is inclin'd to offer, and accept &s;uch Repen|tance, one towards another, and &s;o, that there are mutual Forgivene&s;&s;es among men, and not unap|pea&s;able hatreds; and that there is in a mans own Con&s;cience a preparedne&s;s to acquie&s;ce, to be &s;ati&s;|fied, to Re&s;t, and to be Appea&s;ed upon finding in the Soul, and Action, a &s;orrow for &s;in, and Refor|mation from it: All this keeps the World from be|ing ab&s;olutely Hell.</P>
<P>For Sorrow, Di&s;like, Trouble, Remor&s;e, for what a Man hath done evil, move a man to review, to acknowledgment, to bewailing, to confe&s;&s;ion, to change, and reformation, to a new cour&s;e of Life, and Action.</P>
<P>Seeing then Man is &s;uch a fallen, &s;uch a Peccant, and offending Nature; it is infinite grace in God, that there is &s;uch a Notion, &s;uch Action in mans Soul, as Repentance; and that there is not an utter irreconcilablene&s;s, an unpardonablene&s;s after Offen&s;e committed: neither in Heaven nor on Earth; not in the Court of Heaven, nor in the Court of Human
<PB N="3" REF="20"> Nature one towards another; nor in the Court of a mans Con&s;cience within him&s;elf. If it were not &s;o, every &s;in would be like the <HI>Bla&s;phemy against the Holy Spirit,</HI> Matt. 12. Unpardonable; and be|cau&s;e Unpardonable, Impenitable, <HI>or not to be Re|pented of;</HI> and that <HI>not only in this World,</HI> but in <HI>that which is to come;</HI> the World would become a Theater of &s;in, and damnation; even a Hell, without any Chancery, any Appeal to Grace, to Mercy; or Relenting of Repentance from the hopes of Mercy, the reverence and awes of Goodne&s;s, and Forgive|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now that which lies loo&s;e and &s;cattered, or di&s;|&s;eminated, &s;own through the whole human Creati|on; That, the word of God, e&s;pecially in the Go&s;|pel, in the <HI>New Testament;</HI> that the Spirit of God hath collected into a more full, and &s;olemn Doct|rine, and open'd the Foundation, and laid bare, and in view the root, or the great place of it; How it hath room, and reception; what are the Sources, &s;prings of Efficacy, from which it Ri&s;es: even in the Sacrifice, Blood, and Redemption of Chri&s;t; and the mighly Efficacy, and Grace of the Divine Spirit; what is that <HI>godly &s;orrow,</HI> which is given by God, as the <HI>Elaboratory</HI> or the In&s;trument of God for the Operation of it; what are the Laws and Rules of it; the true form and con&s;titution of it; what are the motives, and inward con&s;iderations mooving to it; what are the &s;igns, and evidences of its Truth; what is the proper time, and &s;pace for it; It re&s;olves the Scruples or Ca&s;es of Con|&s;cience, that may ari&s;e in the Soul of Man concern|ing it; it &s;hews the great Fruit, certain Benefit, and Advantage of it.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="21">
<P>And all the&s;e are either mo&s;t innately re&s;iding or &s;ome way reducible to this great, and excellent Context of the Apo&s;tle; in which regard I have cho&s;en it, and &s;hall endeavour to bring Light ac|cordingly to it; and according to the&s;e heads, I will by the grace of God endeavour to Di&s;cour&s;e it.</P>
<P N="1">1. In regard it is <HI>Repentance to Salvation,</HI> and that <HI>Salvation is no other, but in Chri&s;t alone,</HI> Acts 4.12. it plainly &s;hews, That the whole <HI>Redemption</HI> and <HI>Salvation</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> is the proper Ba&s;is, and Foun|dation of it; the whole <HI>Area,</HI> Court, Space and mo&s;t <HI>proper place</HI> of it; and that the whole Notion and Spirit of it, as any way Commen&s;urate to, or extended upon the whole human Nature, hath its Ri&s;e, and Original; flows from &s;ome Communicati|on to the human Nature from Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Re|deemer; and that yet the word of God and his Go&s;pel only Reveals it fully and genuinely; and his &s;pirit is the &s;upreme Operator of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Here is plainly laid down to us the Elabora|tory, or In&s;trument God hath prepared in infinite Wi&s;dom, and Grace, and inlay'd the Soul with, in order to Repentance. Fir&s;t, as it is a Natural Af|fection &s;ub&s;ervient to it; and then as it is Sanctified by God to &s;o great an end. <HI>Godly &s;orrow,</HI> or <HI>&s;orrow after,</HI> and <HI>according to God worketh down Repentance,</HI> or brings it forth; a &s;orrow oppo&s;ed to the <HI>&s;orrow</HI> of <HI>the World,</HI> that <HI>worketh Death.</HI></P>

<P N="2">2. <HI>Repentance</HI> not to be <HI>Repented of.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="21">

<P N="4">4. In that it ri&s;es not from an earthly &s;pring, or any <HI>&s;orrow,</HI> not <HI>after God.</HI></P>
<P>In all the&s;e Regards, it yeilds ju&s;t rea&s;on to Di&s;|cour&s;e the true Laws, and Rules; the Frame, and true con&s;titution; the motives, means and con&s;ide|rations for; the &s;igns, and evidences of &s;incere Re|pentance.</P>
<P N="4">4. The admirable Fruit and Benefit of it is mo&s;t vi&s;ibly, and illu&s;triou&s;ly &s;et forth before us in tho&s;e words, <HI>It is Repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of.</HI></P>

<P N="5">5. I will Reduce to the Doctrin of Repentance the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ruples, and Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience that may ari&s;e concerning either the true Doctrinal State of it, or the grace of, or practi&s;e it &s;elf of repentance,</P>
<PB N="6" REF="22">
<P>The&s;e are the heads, I Propo&s;e by Divine Grace, and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to Di&s;cour&s;e the Doctrin, and grace of Repentance upon; but I find it is in the fir&s;t place nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome &s;hort de&s;criptions of the thing, <HI>Repentance,</HI> according to the very impor|tance of the word; and of the General Importance, and Nature of the Notion, or the thing it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The words us'd by the Spirit of God in the Old Te&s;tament, are either that &s;trict word <GAP LANG="heb" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, a word that al&s;o &s;ignifies Con&s;olating a mans &s;elf; &s;hewing, after &s;in, and offen&s;e reflected upon, <HI>viz.</HI> with G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ief, and Trouble &s;uppo&s;ed; the greate&s;t con|&s;olation is recovery of a mans &s;elf by <HI>Repentance:</HI> Or el&s;e, it is a word, that &s;ignifies <HI>Turning</HI> from what a man has b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">en <HI>Turn'd</HI> and <HI>Po&s;ited,</HI> and &s;et him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o before. On this Account we meet &s;o often with the words of Turning in the Old Te&s;tament, and being Converted, and Turning in the New.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper and &s;trict words in the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> are either an <HI>After Care,</HI> a Reflection with &s;orrow, and &s;ollicitou&s;ne&s;s upon what a man hath done, with Trouble, He did &s;o; and a care, a caution not to do &s;o any more for the time to come; or an <HI>after-mind,</HI> an <HI>after-wit,</HI> an <HI>after un|der&s;tanding, a tran&s;mentation, a new Mind, a new Heart and Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;peak of it therefore in the general; Repen|tance is given by God, as a mighty Spiritual In&s;tru|ment, or Engine in the hand of his Grace, in the <HI>Arm of God made Bare,</HI> by which the &s;inful Na|ture, in every true Penitent, is unhing'd, uncen|ter'd from &s;in, and corruption. It is a return of the Soul home to it &s;elf, after a Spiritual Phren&s;y, and Madne&s;s; The <HI>Prodigal</HI> is &s;aid <HI>to come to him|&s;elf:</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="22"> It is a return to its <HI>Fathers Hou&s;e,</HI> after a long bewildred State; <HI>This my Son was lo&s;t, and is found.</HI> But beyond all this, it is a Spiritual Re&s;urrection, a return from Death to Life; <HI>This my Son was Dead, and is A Live,</HI> Luke 15.</P>
<P>And indeed, as there is no notion of Scripure, that is more &s;uited to expre&s;s the corrupt Nature of Man, than Death; &s;o the fir&s;t Threat Ran, <HI>In the day thou eate&s;t thereof,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gen. 2.17.</NOTE> <HI>thou &s;halt dye the Deatb.

<P>This is the general Notion of Repentance; but it may be further Explain'd in the&s;e three Particu|lars, and yet in a general way.</P>
<P N="1">1. Repentance is an inward, &s;incere, habitual Change of the Heart, and of the de&s;ign, and pur|po&s;e; and &s;o of the outward Action, and Cour&s;e of Life, and Conduct of a mans ways; ari&s;ing from an utter di&s;like of his, former Coun&s;el, Purpo&s;e and De&s;ign, and the cour&s;e of Conver&s;ation, Life, and Action proceeding from it; &s;o that it becomes wholly New: This is the generel Nature of Re|pentance,
<PB N="8" REF="23"> as it looks to the government of a mans &s;elf, and of his Actions: Now this in Scripture, and Evangelical Repentance is the change from &s;in to Holine&s;s, from a worldly &s;tate, and conver&s;ation to an Heavenly; and from the Creature, to God, and to Chri&s;t; an utter di&s;like of, and trouble at the former Regiment, and &s;teerage of a mans cour&s;e, &s;o as utterly to for&s;ake it; and with &s;orrow, &s;hame, and a&s;toni&s;hment, to &s;ay to his &s;inful ways, &s;o con|trary to the Rules of Holine&s;s, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Purity, <HI>Get ye hence, and what have I to do any more with you?</HI> I will now guide my &s;elf by the word of my God, and hate every fal&s;e way, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.

<P N="2">2.

I &s;ay unto you, my Freinds, fear not them that Kill the Body, and have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you, whom you &s;hall fear, fear him, who after hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into Hell, yea,</HI> I <HI>&s;ay unto you, fear him: Oh! that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their latter end: I &s;ay unto you, repent, el&s;e you &s;hall likewi&s;e peri&s;h; who hath forewarned you to fly from the wrath to come; God hath commanded all men every where to Repent; becau&s;e he hath ap|pointed a day, in which he will Judg the World: Re|pentance unto Life: Repent, and turn your &s;elves, that Iniquity may not be your ruin; Repent, and be Converted, that your &s;ins may be blotted out, when the times of Re|fre&s;hing &s;hall come forth from the pre&s;ence of the Lord; Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> Thus Scripture having the&s;e two handles of the Soul, Fear of Evil, and de&s;ire of happine&s;s, mightily moves it to Repentance by them; it holds the&s;e two great Globes, the World of Happine&s;s, and the World of Mi&s;ery, both pre&s;ent, and to come; and &s;o with a Scepter &s;o Potent, it &s;ways the Spirits of Men; as the Divine Spirit, that dwells in it, plea|&s;es.</P>
<P>I have thus far given the Nature of <HI>Repentance</HI> in general, that it may be the better under&s;tood, what we are now to Di&s;cour&s;e: I begin therefore with the fir&s;t Head: that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which is &s;o Com|municated to the very inward &s;en&s;e of mankind, &s;prings from, and hath its whole place in the Re|demption of Chri&s;t. The Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of <HI>E&s;au,</HI> that he <HI>found no place for Repentance;</HI> there is a pro|per
<PB N="12" REF="25"> <HI>place for Repentance.</HI> And this, I &s;ay, is the Re|demption of Chri&s;t, that hath laid the <HI>Ba&s;is,</HI> the Foundation of Repentance; that hath &s;pread over Human Nature, the notion and &s;en&s;e of Repentance. And where it is truly wrought, the Spirit of Chri&s;t takes it from Chri&s;t, and gives it to the Soul, and it is accepted only in, and through Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is therefore to be under&s;tood, that there had no <HI>Place</HI> been Found for <HI>Repentance,</HI> had it not been for the undertaking of Chri&s;t; For Repen|tance being a rational Act, it mu&s;t have a Rational Foundation, and Encouragement. If there were then no Mercy, no Forgivene&s;s, no Salvation; there could be no Repentance but that of fruitle&s;s &s;orrow, horror, and de&s;pair: the Repentance of <HI>wailing</HI> and <HI>Gna&s;hing the Teeth:</HI> that is, the Repentance that is in Hell, a Repentance without being chang'd or made better. Seeing then Salvation, Forgivene&s;s, Mercy are all bound up in the Name of Chri&s;t; For they are no where el&s;e; the Redemption of Chri&s;t is the only foundation of Repentance, &s;uch a Repentance as hath in it a change from &s;in to Holine&s;s: <HI>David</HI> gives us this great In&s;truction, P&s;al. 130. <HI>There is forgivene&s;s with thee, that thou maist be feared;</HI> that <HI>thou maie&s;t be feared</HI> with the Awes, with the Re|verences of <HI>Repentance,</HI> there is Forgivene&s;s with thee; there had been no place for &s;uch Fear of thee, if thou <HI>hadst been &s;o extreme to mark what is done a|mi&s;s,</HI> as that there had been <HI>no Forgvene&s;s with thee.</HI></P>
<P>And this is mo&s;t evident al&s;o in that Doctrin of the Apo&s;tle before mentioned, concerning the Re|pentance in the ca&s;e of <HI>E&s;au:</HI> When he had <HI>de&s;pi&s;|ed</HI> and <HI>&s;old</HI> his <HI>Birth-right,</HI> and would after <HI>Inherit

He found no <HI>Place</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> becau&s;e he was <HI>re|jected.</HI> Whether we under&s;tand it of <HI>I&s;aack's,</HI> or of <HI>E&s;au's Repentance,</HI> it is much at one: If we un|der&s;tand it of <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s <HI>Repentance,</HI> finding no place in him&s;elf; &s;o it hath this &s;en&s;e; That <HI>Repentance</HI> flies into De&s;pair, if it be not accepted, when we tender it: Or if we under&s;tand it of <HI>I&s;aac</HI> not <HI>Re|penting,</HI> when <HI>E&s;au</HI> wept to procure it, but &s;till fixed the ble&s;&s;ing on <HI>Jacob,</HI> it is &s;till the &s;ame thing; for if God did not plea&s;e to accept our Repentance, or him&s;elf, to <HI>Repent</HI> in a &s;en&s;e worthy of him; our <HI>Repentance</HI> would be to no more purpo&s;e, than <HI>E&s;au</HI>'s <HI>Tears,</HI> or than the weeping in Hell; we &s;hould be <HI>Rejected,</HI> and <HI>Reprobated</HI> in our <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Law,</HI> that &s;ays, <HI>cur&s;ed is every one that hath not continued in all things, to do them,</HI> Gal. 3. and <HI>Do this</HI> in the fir&s;t Act, and Live, leaves no room for <HI>Re|pentance;</HI> but the <HI>bringing</HI> in a <HI>better</HI> hope even pardon of Sin, Attonement, and Reconciliarion in the Blood of Chri&s;t, does, <HI>by this we draw nigh to God in Repentance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heb.</HI> 7.17.</NOTE> and are not <HI>Re|jected</HI> but <HI>Accepted.</HI></P>
<P>Here then there is Rational Foundation, and Encouragement for <HI>Repentance;</HI> becau&s;e it &s;hall not be thrown upon, and into De&s;pair; there is <HI>Hope concerning this thing in the Go&s;pel;</HI> let us therefore by <HI>Repentance</HI> pre&s;s home, and return to God in Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, <HI>Repentance</HI> is the gift of God, a Grace given by him; If God, <HI>peradventure, will give Re|pentance,</HI> and, then <HI>hath God granted unto the Gentiles
<PB N="14" REF="26"> Repentance unto Life;</HI> Chri&s;t is a <HI>Prince and Saviour rai&s;ed up by God to give Repentance,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 2.25. Acts 5.31.</NOTE> <HI>and Remi&s;&s;ion of Sins.</HI> So Repentance is a Gift or a Grace; It cannot be Educed, it cannot be drawn out by an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Powers of Nature; It is not <HI>of Man,</HI> or of <HI>the Will of Man, It is not of Bloods:</HI> It is not by Derivation, or De&s;cent from <HI>Adam;</HI> It does not run in the Chan|nel of Human Blood. God therefore does not give &s;uch Grace in Vain; but when he hath &s;ettled a Fund of Pardon, Reconcilement, and Salvation: He fir&s;t &s;ettled that; el&s;e Repentance had been in Vain, as the Eye would have been, if God had not fir&s;t made Light; Light is alone in Chri&s;t: He does not give Grace that &s;hall be to no purpo&s;e, he gives no man the <HI>Repentance</HI> he will not Accept and Par|don upon: He does not expo&s;e his own Grace to Damnation, or to the Flames of Hell; nor does he give any Grace, but in the Mediator, in the Redeem|er: So the Redemption of Chri&s;t mu&s;t needs be the Foundation of Repentance; there had never been el&s;e the Notion the po&s;&s;ibility of Repentance; there had never been the &s;ound, or report of it heard in the World.</P>
<P>This then being the Foundation, let us take the true degrees of the &s;tate of Repentance in two <HI>Po|&s;itions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Po&s;it.</HI> 1. God hath wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ten in the very Heart of Man the excellency of this Grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nd Duty of Re|pentance; tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> it is not far from him, that he &s;hould <HI>go up into Heaven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 10.</NOTE> or <HI>down into the Deep,</HI> or <HI>beyond the Sea for it; It is in his Heart:</HI> So the Knowledg of it is
<PB N="15" REF="26"> very near him: God hath al&s;o put a Tenderne&s;s, towards it, a Flexiblene&s;s, he hath made the Soul of Man, the Con&s;cience, and Affections plyable to it: And this, we &s;hall &s;ee, is from the Mediator.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, this may &s;eem hard to be under&s;tood; &s;eeing Repentance is fitted and prepared for a &s;in|ful fallen Creature: Now in that man was at fir&s;t Created upright, and perfect, and good; and what <HI>was written in mans Heart,</HI> was <HI>written</HI> there in his Creation; what place could there be for Re|pentance? <HI>Adam</HI> was &s;o <HI>righteous a per&s;on</HI> he could <HI>need no Repentance,</HI> why then &s;hould <HI>repentance be written in his Heart?</HI></P>
<P>And yet notwith&s;tanding, we find by experi|ence, and univer&s;al Ob&s;ervation; It is a notion very intimate to every mans Soul, and even in|dear'd to his Thoughts: Every man &s;eems to be glad, there is &s;uch a notion, &s;uch an Idea in his Soul; and they that hear of it, and know it from Scripture, acknowledg immediately the goodne&s;s and rea&s;onablene&s;s of it, and rejoyce in it: And tho a man do not fall down right upon the Practi&s;e of it, yet he is plea&s;ed with the promi&s;e to him|&s;elf, he will at &s;ome time repent, and reform, and grow better; and there is proportionably a general Faith, Repentance will be accepted, and the repent|ing Offender Pardoned. If men are told, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity change, repent and reform from their &s;inful cour&s;es: If they are per&s;waded to become o|ther men, they are not &s;o apt to be Angry, but rather &s;ay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 24.25.</NOTE> <HI>They will take a convenient time for it;</HI> tho Temptati|on carry them away, yet they heartily Embrace the thing it &s;elf, as to the a&s;&s;ent, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="16" REF="27"> and acknowledgment, that it ought to be &s;o. Men are convinc'd, that while they defer to enter into the Practi&s;e, that yet they ought to <HI>repent.</HI></P>
<P>This I a&s;&s;ert is through the Grace of the Redeem|er; I would therefore endeavour to find out, how this notion of repentance comes to be &s;o very inti|mate and connatural to mans Soul; and with &s;uch a Engraven, Engrafted Hope, and belief of Pardon upon it? How it comes to pa&s;s, that the demands of Natural Con&s;cience do &s;o wonderfully lead to Repentance; and are like tho&s;e of Natural Ju&s;tice, and common Hone&s;ty; of Soberne&s;s, and Temper|ance, of Truth, Mercy, and Compa&s;&s;ion, or what|ever is accepted in the World as morally good and excellent; and even as the deep impre&s;&s;ions of natural Religion, &s;en&s;e of God, and obedience to him? All the&s;e give an honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o Repentance, exert and urge the Soul to it. By the &s;ame &s;enti|ments of Soul, we allow the one, we allow the other al&s;o: If the remains of natural Con&s;cience call a man out to the one, they &s;ummon him to the other al&s;o: And yet all this, I affirm, is from the Grace of the Redeemer. And this I would make out by two things.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P>Now the&s;e two laid together, explain to us how <HI>Repentance</HI> is through the Grace of the Mediator, <HI>written:</HI> even as all natural Religion, and Morality in the very Heart of Man, and di&s;cernable by that Light: For when the fir&s;t Commands and Emoti|ons of <HI>Natural Con&s;cience</HI> are to do the things that are Holy, and Righteous, and Good; and we find, that tho we have violated and perverted the thing that is right; yet we retain a love to tho&s;e Laws of <HI>Eternal Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Goodne&s;s;</HI> we have not lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of them, of de&s;ire of likene&s;s to, and a|greement with them; thus we find a &s;orrow in and trouble within us, that we have offended; and that the wrath and ju&s;tice of the &s;upreme Ruler, and Governor, and Judg of all the World is not &s;o &s;ud|den and immediate in his Revenges upon us; but that we have &s;pace and time for return to God, and to Holine&s;s: There is by the very &s;ame Authority of natural Con&s;cience, that requir'd Holine&s;s in our fir&s;t Acts, and thereby to plea&s;e God: a clo&s;e obli|gation to return to him by Repentance, and to a|mend what we have done of evil again&s;t him, and to be&s;eech Pardon and Reconciliation with offended Ju&s;tice: Now when on the other &s;ide, the <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>long-&s;uffering</HI> of God gives encouragement, and even A&s;&s;urance, he will accept Repentance by his giving &s;cope, &s;pace and opportunity for it: Here is great ground for Repentance: For the Soul and Mind of Man finding &s;till in it &s;elf that Primitive Love to, reverential &s;en&s;e of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and that it cannot bid defiance to it, as lo&s;t Spirits do, there imme|diately ri&s;es in it an earne&s;t endeavour to <HI>Self-re|&s;titution,</HI>

<P N="1">1.

<P>Now indeed <HI>all Affection,</HI> and even <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> to &s;peak mo&s;t &s;trictly and properly, is in the Spirit; For it is all one to matter, how it be u&s;ed; or into what Form it is made to pa&s;s: or out of what, or in di&s;|junction from what Form it is forc'd to move: So that All we feel, by way of &s;uffering, or Enjoyment, is by the Spirit's having a Plea&s;ing, or an Afflicting Sen&s;e of Things: But this I wave, as not &s;o nece&s;&s;a|ry

<P>Under this I will Di&s;cour&s;e the&s;e following Parti|culars:</P>
<P N="1">1. In <HI>Repentance:</HI> The Humble, Repenting Soul ca&s;ts it &s;elf down in the mo&s;t lowly, and Self-aba|&s;ing Acknowledgment of &s;in, and confe&s;&s;ion of it. Scripture therefore points &s;o much at <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion: He that confe&s;&s;eth, and for&s;aketh:</HI> He mu&s;t fir&s;t <HI>confe&s;s,</HI> and then <HI>for&s;ake his &s;ins,</HI> and <HI>he &s;hall find mercy,</HI> Prov. 28.13. And <HI>David</HI> de&s;cribes a <HI>Penitent,</HI> as one, <HI>in who&s;e Spirit there is no guile:</HI> that is, he makes an open, &s;incere, hearty Confe&s;&s;ion. This is one Branch of the De&s;cription of the <HI>Ble&s;led Man, who&s;e Iniquities are forgiven, and who&s;e &s;ins are co|vered;</HI> and to whom <HI>the Lord will not impute Iniqui|ty:</HI> And after, it follows, <HI>I acknowledg'd my Iniqui|ty unto thee, and my &s;in have I not hid: I &s;aid, I will confe&s;s my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion unto the Lord, and thou forga|ve&s;t the Iniquity rf my &s; n.</HI> But before I did this, and while <HI>I kept &s;ilence, thy hand was heavy upon me;</HI> &s;o that <HI>my moi&s;ture was tu ned inio the drought of &s;ummer,</HI> P&s;alm 32.1, <HI>&amp;c. I acknowledge my tnan&s;|gre&s;&s;ion, and my &s;in is ever before me,</HI> P&s;alm 51.3. <HI>Ezra thus made confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> c. 9. So <HI>Nehemiah.</HI> c. 9. So <HI>Daniel,</HI> c. 9.

<P>Now <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in</HI> is not accepted of God for it &s;elf: For what can we &s;uppo&s;e, the Relation of
<PB N="64" REF="51"> our &s;ins can be to God, the <HI>Eyes</HI> of who&s;e <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> are &s;o <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ovok'd</HI> by our &s;ins? But he hath only Regard to us, that we &s;hould in hatred of our &s;ins, and of our &s;inful &s;elves, expo&s;e them with ha|tred, and abhorrence of our &s;elves; and becau&s;e we are re&s;olved to have no more to do with them, we di&s;cover and detect them, without any thing of <HI>Guile,</HI> without any <HI>Re&s;erve:</HI> For, as the Expre&s;|&s;ion is in <HI>Job,</HI> when we <HI>&s;pare our &s;ins,</HI> we <HI>roll them under our Tongues.</HI> The more therefore we con|fe&s;s them with trouble of Mind, and in bitterne&s;s of Spirit, and with Re&s;olutions of having no more to do with them, the more acceptable is our Confe&s;&s;ion to God; becau&s;e thereby our Confe&s;&s;ion the more attains God's Ends, and what he is mo&s;t pleas'd with in our Confe&s;&s;ion. For therein is our &s;incerity, when we confe&s;s &s;in, becau&s;e it is Rea&s;on|able to expect we will not be reconcil'd to the &s;ins we confe&s;s: For that is for <HI>the Dog to return to his Vomit.</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion of our &s;ins, with Loathing and Abhorrence, is <HI>vomiting them out of our mouths.</HI> And sherefore to <HI>return to them again,</HI> is to return to our <HI>Vomit:</HI> and Confe&s;&s;ion is like Wa&s;hing and Purify|ing our &s;elves: To retturn therefore to the &s;ins we have confe&s;s'd is <HI>wallowing our &s;elves in the mire,</HI> af|ter <HI>wa&s;hing.</HI> This &s;eems &s;o Rea&s;onable, and even Nece&s;&s;ary, that when it is fir&s;t &s;aid, <HI>He that hideth and covereth his &s;ins, &s;hall not pro&s;per:</HI> Then, he that <HI>confe&s;&s;eth, and for&s;aketh, &s;hall find mercy.</HI> It is &s;up|po&s;ed, if any Man does not <HI>confe&s;s,</HI> he will not <HI>for|&s;ake;</HI> but if he confe&s;&s;es, he does it in order to <HI>for|&s;aking.</HI> But yet becau&s;e Men are &s;o apt to deceive them&s;elves with Formality, and to think, God may be &s;o put off, and pleas'd, he adds; He that not on|ly
<PB N="65" REF="51"> <HI>confe&s;leth,</HI> but does that which is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary with Confe&s;&s;ion <HI>for&s;akes; &s;hall find mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Solomon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8.</NOTE> all along his Pray|er, joyns many Expre&s;&s;ions, that are the undoubted Acts of <HI>&s;incere Repentance,</HI> to|gether with the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in.</HI> And if Confe&s;&s;ion be thus joyn'd with Sorrow, Shame, Trouble, Ha|tred of &s;ins and utter &s;eparation from them; it could not de&s;ervedly fall under that Ridicule, and Contempt, that prophane men put upon it; as if it were the telling God only the Story of our wick|ed Hearts, or Lives: But without other &s;incere, effective Powers of Repentance, it too ju&s;tly <HI>falls under that Reproach;</HI> but any &s;uch <HI>Reproach, our Lord will return upon us, and our Confe&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>

<PB N="91" REF="64"> Even from every one of their own Iniquities;</HI> and makes up, whatever is wanting in the &s;everities, or Powers of Holine&s;s in Repentance, by his own <HI>Sufferings and Obedience.</HI> And thus the weight of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> that &s;hall never be <HI>found fault with,</HI> becau&s;e the Covenantees brake it, is &s;u&s;pended upon him, that is <HI>mighty;</HI> the <HI>Nail fasten'd in a place &s;o &s;ure,</HI> that the <HI>weight</HI> of not only <HI>Cups,</HI> but <HI>Flagons, Ve&s;&s;els,</HI> of all <HI>Quantities,</HI> both the <HI>I&s;&s;ue,</HI> and <HI>the Off-&s;pring,</HI> re&s;t &s;ecure upon him, even to Eternity, <HI>E&s;ay</HI> 22.23.

<P>Now becau&s;e this is a point of great moment to the Doctrine of Repentance, and &s;ets forth much of the Excellency of Repentance: I &s;hall give very great Scriptures, and argue upon them for the truth of ir.</P>
<P><HI>Scripture</HI> 1. The fir&s;t Scripture I would in&s;i&s;t upon, &s;hall be from a con&s;ideration of that great Ordinance of God concerning <HI>the Day of Attone|ment among the Children of</HI> I&s;rael: <HI>This Ordinance We find,</HI> Levit. 23.27. <HI>In the tenth day of the &s;e|venth, the Sabbattical Month, there &s;hall be a day of attonement: It &s;hall be an Holy Convocation to you: and you &s;hall afflict your Souls: And you &s;hall do no work in that &s;ame day: For it is a day of Attonement to make Attonement for you before the Lord your God: for what&s;oever Soul it be, that &s;hall not be afflicted in that &s;ame Day, he &s;hall be cut off from among his People: And what&s;oever Soul it be that doth any work in that &s;ame day, the &s;ame Soul will I de&s;troy from
<PB N="100" REF="69"> among his People: It &s;hall be a &s;tatute for ever through|out your Generations in all your Dwellings: It &s;hall be to you a Sabbath of Re&s;t, and you &s;hall Afflict your Souls.</HI> And on that day there were the great rites of <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> the <HI>Bullock,</HI> the &s;in Offering; the Blood of which was carried into the Holy of Ho|lies, to make an attonement for the <HI>&V;ncleanne&s;&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> and to reconcile the <HI>Holy</HI> of <HI>Holies,</HI> and the <HI>Mercy Seat,</HI> and the <HI>Ta|hernacle</HI> of <HI>the Congregation,</HI> and the <HI>Goat</HI> that was to be Kill'ed in the &s;ame Manner; and the <HI>&s;cape-Goat,</HI> throughout c, 16.</P>
<P>Now that which I lay in the Foundation, is, That God never appointed any of the&s;e great Rites, but they had a Solemn &s;ignification; a &s;ig|nification, as &s;ollemn, as the <HI>Type</HI> was: So that there mu&s;t be &s;ome great &s;en&s;e of this <HI>day of attone|ment;</HI> I know it had a great fulfilling in Chri&s;t; and in him, as an <HI>Offering once for all,</HI> that imme|diately <HI>Entred into the Holy of Holies,</HI> with his <HI>own Blood to appear in Heaven for us,</HI> It had very great parts of its accompli&s;hment: But there are other great Parts that are to be fulfill'd in his Saints and for them, as in them&s;elves: And e&s;pecially in this &s;olemn <HI>Affliction:</HI> So that as if any did not <HI>afflict their Souls,</HI> they were to <HI>be cut off</HI> &s;o now.</P>
<P>And in the&s;e things, this day had many very remarkable Lines of the &s;ollemn <HI>affliction</HI> and <HI>attone|ment,</HI> that &s;hall be in the very la&s;t parts of Time, and near the &s;tate of <HI>the Kingdom of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It was an <HI>Ordinance throughout the Generations</HI> of both Natural, and Adopted <HI>I&s;rael.</HI> A <HI>Statute for ever,</HI> that is, until the very <HI>Kingdom of Christ.</HI></P>
<PB N="101" REF="69">

<P N="4">4. That peculiar <HI>Sacrifical</HI> Rite of the <HI>Scape Goat</HI> on this day &s;ent <HI>away into the Wilderne&s;s,</HI> was a mo&s;t lively &s;ignification of the final act of Obli|vion, and act of <HI>Amne&s;ty upon all &s;in,</HI> and the <HI>Cur&s;e</HI> for it born away into the <HI>Land of Forgetfulne&s;s,</HI> and &s;o perfect <HI>attonement</HI> made, and all former Evils of the Cur&s;e Forgotten, <HI>E&s;ay</HI> 65.16, 17.</P>

<P>For when God hath given a Nation an univer|&s;al con&s;ent in the Profe&s;&s;ion of the Name of God, of Chri&s;t, and of the Go&s;pel, they do in many great Regards, and Accounts of Scripture, come
<PB N="108" REF="73"> under &s;uch an Obligatory repre&s;entation, as a <HI>Na|tional Church;</HI> as <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in the times of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament</HI> came under. And all particu|lar <HI>Churches,</HI> wherein &s;o ever they differ in many particulars, and make di&s;tinct A&s;&s;ociations of them|&s;elves, may be look'd upon, as particular <HI>Churches;</HI> and &s;o Scripture vouches for them; becau&s;e they do in a Particular Union <HI>give them&s;elves to the Lord, and to one another;</HI> yet notwith&s;tanding, they cannot, what ever they may think, put off their Relation to the whole Nation, whereto they are United as parts; nor to it, as United with them, in the &s;ub&s;tantial E&s;&s;ential Points of Chri&s;ti|anity, not &s;o Adulterated, but that &s;uch Church is look'd upon as a true Church, by God, and by Chri&s;t.</P>

<P>Now this I have Premi&s;'d, to &s;hew, how nece&s;&s;ary the Doctrine of Repentance is to be Of|fered, and to be Receiv'd by the generality of the <HI>Church, Churches,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> of this Nation; ac|cording to the Doctrine of both the <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> even that Repentance that hath been Di&s;cours'd; the <HI>Repentance to Salvation, never to be Repented of,</HI> and to be wrought by a <HI>Godly &s;orrow,</HI> or a <HI>&s;orrow after God.</HI></P>
<P>It may look like a Difficulty; how a Nation Compo&s;ed of &s;uch Variety of le&s;&s;er, and di&s;tinct Communities, one from another; and much more &s;o many &s;ingle per&s;ons, &s;hould be brought to Unite in Repentance; or a Church, that hath &s;o many le&s;&s;er, and different Churches; or, How &s;uch a Repentance can be <HI>a Repentance to Salvation;</HI> &s;eeing Nations are not &s;o much &s;av'd as Nations, but particular Per&s;ons, of tho&s;e general Commu|nities are the Saved.</P>
<P>This may be three ways Reconciled.</P>
<P N="1">1. By con&s;idering, there is the Face of a Nati|on, and of a National Profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, in the Princes, Rulers, and Councels of it: and When the&s;e &s;et them&s;elves to Repentance, of Refor|mation: How greatly nece&s;&s;ary therefore is it to Repre&s;ent with greate&s;t Efficacies of Per&s;wa&s;ion to them the duty to Reform them&s;elves; and to be ex|amples of the &s;ame to the Nation: We find therefore Univer&s;ally in Scripture, there is &s;o much applica|tion to the Kings, and Nobles, the Coun&s;ellors, and Judges of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> and Remon&s;trances again&s;t their &s;ins, and not Reforming.</P>
<PB N="110" REF="74">
<P>And this lies with e&s;pecial Obligation upon tho&s;e, who are Exalted into the mo&s;t publick Stations of the Chri&s;tian Mini&s;tration; tho&s;e, who are the mo&s;t publick <HI>Seers.</HI> So we find <HI>Nathan,</HI> the King's <HI>Seer,</HI> was cho&s;en out by God to &s;peak to <HI>David,</HI> in tho&s;e two great &s;ervices of &s;hewing <HI>David</HI> his &s;in, and moving him to Repentance, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12. When he had &s;o fallen; God &s;ent to move him to Repentance by his own <HI>Seer,</HI> or, as I may Expre&s;s it, <HI>Bi&s;hop.</HI> And &s;o in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Numbring the People;</HI> God &s;ent to <HI>David</HI> by <HI>Gad,</HI> another of his <HI>Seers,</HI> 2 Sam. 24.11.</P>
<P>Again, when God declared to <HI>David</HI> the <HI>Building the Temple,</HI> not by him&s;elf, but by his Son <HI>Solomon;</HI> to encourage his Preparation for it; but to Countermand his Building it; he did it by the &s;ame <HI>Nathan, his Seer,</HI> 1 Chron. 17.3.</P>
<P>And thus when God, by his Providence, Ex|alts any to a Precedency, or Pre&s;idency in the <HI>Go&s;pel Ministry,</HI> &s;o as to be near Princes, and Councels, and Senates in that high Admini&s;tra|tion; when they are Zealous, and Succe&s;sful in their <HI>Preaching Repentance;</HI> and &s;uch <HI>Higher Powers</HI> are mov'd by it: This generally goes down from &s;uch <HI>Heads</HI> of a <HI>Nation,</HI> to the <HI>skirts of the Garment,</HI> viz. The &s;ubordinated Mini&s;try of a Nation, and its Magi&s;tracy, and &s;o to the ge|nerality of the People: And it becomes in God's gracious acceptance through Chri&s;t, and Ac|count, a <HI>National Repentance,</HI> though there may be many particular Per&s;ons, both in Mini&s;try and Magi&s;tracy negligent of their Duty, and much more many unreformed Per&s;ons among the Multitude.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="74">
<P>And &s;uch Repentance may be called <HI>Repentance to Salvation,</HI> For it does not only, as in the <HI>King of Nineveh's</HI> Ca&s;e, give a Reprieve from pre&s;enr Judgments, and bring in great Ble&s;&s;ings, and pro&s;perity to a Nation at the pre&s;ent; but there is very great Rea&s;on to believe in the vi&s;ible Glory of the <HI>Kingdom of Christ:</HI> There are, as I may &s;o &s;peak, Con&s;tellations of Saints, who have joyn'd together in the &s;ame Nation, and time in Repentance, and earne&s;t Endeavours for <HI>Reforma|tion;</HI> for, as <HI>Daniel</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The Wi&s;e,</HI> and <HI>they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;hall &s;hine as the Stars,</HI> and as the <HI>brightne&s;s of the Firmament for ever, and ever,</HI> Dan, 12.3.</P>
<P>Now how does the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the Nation require the joyning of all that fear God, to re|trench that boldne&s;s, and in&s;olency of wickedne&s;s that rages throughout the Nation; and to nece&s;&s;i|tate the Vices and Prophane&s;&s;es of Men, who have no fear of God, to keep within, and not to &s;hew them&s;elves, as they do openly, and abroad! and in the mean time, to give &s;uch an Honour to <HI>God|line&s;s, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Soberne&s;s;</HI> that the con|trary to the&s;e may not be charged as National &s;ins; and therefore herein, tho&s;e that are principal <HI>Seers</HI> of the Nation, and have opportunity to do it to Princes, and Councels, are under greate&s;t obligations of Duty, Love, Honour, and Service to God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to move with light, and Heat in their Orb, and Sphere; to make due remon&s;trances of the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity, that there is, to di&s;charge the Nation of that great weight of Publick Guilt, that lies upon it by the Enormities; that not being re&s;train'd, and

<P N="2">2. To enquire into the Cau&s;es, why God is pleas'd to make &s;uch Concu&s;&s;ions, and Convul&s;i|ons in Nature.</P>

<P>I begin then with the fir&s;t Head, in Four Points.</P>
<P>Point I. The Scripture teacheth us, This great Globe of Earth and Water is hung by the <HI>mighty Wi&s;dom,</HI> Skill, and Power of the great
<PB N="133" REF="85"> <HI>Geometer</HI> of Heaven and Earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earth being Round, is on eve|ry &s;ide encompa&s;|&s;ed with Air and Skie, as they who &s;ail it round, find, as well as by Rea|&s;on it is demon|&s;trated.</NOTE> as a Ball in the Air: So we read <HI>Job</HI> 26.7. <HI>He &s;tretcheth out the North over the empty Place,</HI> (for &s;o to our eye and motion the meer Air &s;eems to be) and <HI>he hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</HI> I know this is a Point proper to <HI>Philo&s;ophical</HI> Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that it may go as far, as it can, upon: But tho&s;e Que&s;tions God asked <HI>Job</HI> 38.4. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> would po&s;e the wi&s;e&s;t of the World; <HI>Declare, if thou ha&s;t under&s;tanding, Who hath laid the Mea&s;ures of the Earth? If thou knowe&s;t, who hath &s;tretched the Line upon it &s;o, that it is in ju&s;t number, weight, and mea&s;ure. Whereupon are the Foundations thereof fa&s;tned? or who laid the Corner-&s;tone thereof?</HI> There may be hand&s;ome and plau&s;ible <HI>&s;olving the Phenomenae</HI> (as they &s;peak) before Men, who know as little, the be&s;t of them, one as another; but before God, all is but <HI>darkning Coun&s;el by Words without Knowledge.</HI> Now when it is &s;o, that the Earth <HI>hangs</HI> thus, How mu&s;t it needs be, that God as he plea&s;es may &s;hake the <HI>Earth out of its place</HI> with a touch of his hand, and <HI>all the Inhabitants</HI> thereof, and his Enemies particularly be <HI>&s;haken out of it,</HI> or off from it, or whither, or how he plea&s;es: For if that bold Man of <HI>Mathematicks</HI> dur&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Give me where to &s;et my foot, and I will remove the Earth,</HI> what can infinite Under|&s;tanding and Power do? or if he does but &s;lacken his hand from holding the Ballance even, keeping the Scales of Earth and Air ju&s;t; or if there be &s;uch a
<PB N="134" REF="86"> one; as with great Rea&s;on hath been thought; the Poize of the Central Fire, Even, all would be in immediate Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>On this Con&s;ideration then, any kind of Earth|quakes is no wonder; the wonder is, they are not every day, and not to the utmo&s;t. The only &s;e|curity is, the unchangeablene&s;s of Divine Ordina|tion for &s;uch a time as he hath decreed, &s;ince the Flood; wherein, in all appearance of Rea&s;on as well as Scripture, there was even in this regard a Jog, as one may &s;ay of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Ballance is in this regard yet &s;o Even, and ju&s;t, that nothing we account mo&s;t &s;urely founded, &s;tands &s;o fa&s;t, &s;o firm, and &s;ecure, as the Earth, that it cannot be moved: So that al|lowing it to have a <HI>Diurnal,</HI> or every days Revo|lution from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t;</HI> yet it is with &s;uch e|quality, that it di&s;turbs all upon it, no more, than a Fly &s;itting it &s;elf fa&s;t on a Globe, is un|&s;ettled by its being turn'd round. Notwith&s;tand|ing this motion, the <HI>Earth</HI> is <HI>founded on the Seas,</HI> and <HI>E&s;tabli&s;hed on the Floods;</HI> that is, the Waters are &s;o every way compacted, under, and about, and over it, that it is as it were <HI>founded</HI> upon it, as on <HI>Pillars of Marble,</HI> which may have been under&s;tood, fir&s;t according to the excellent forementioned <HI>Theory</HI> of the <HI>Earth:</HI> 2. As the Cement and Fixation of the upper Parts of the Earth is the moi&s;ture it receives from the Waters: 3. As the ambient or round-about Air hath a more immediate force upon the Waters to crowd and keep them clo&s;e to the Earth, than the Air it &s;elf could have upon the Earth, the Water being a middle Body between Air and Earth, even as
<PB N="135" REF="86"> the Air is between that &s;ubtile Matter we call <HI>Ether,</HI> and Air. So that the Earth hath <HI>Foun|dations, Pillars, Corner-&s;tone</HI> in Scripture-Lan|guage. And this is indeed ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch kind of Bodies, and Works, as are to move and re&s;t upon this Earth; which is as a <HI>Sea</HI> in regard of the variety of Creatures in it, where|in are <HI>Things creeping innumerable,</HI> and <HI>both great</HI> and <HI>&s;mall Bea&s;ts;</HI> and <HI>Man</HI> the highe&s;t Or|der of <HI>Animals.</HI> Now the&s;e require &s;uch a &s;olid Floor and Pavement to move upon, &s;uch a Bed to re&s;t upon: Upon this Earth is the whole Ve|getative Nature, both nouri&s;hed and &s;upported, as in a Nur&s;ery; even from the <HI>Cedar in Leba|non</HI> to the <HI>Hy&s;op</HI> that <HI>grows in the Wall:</HI> Hereon have all the Great Buildings, the Palaces, Ca&s;tles, Towers, multiplied into Cities and Towns their Foundations.</P>
<P>Now &s;eeing all the&s;e have their Order, their Quiet, their Safety by the &s;teddine&s;s of the Earth; whenever it is moved, there is an immediate Shatter, Confu&s;ion, Di&s;order, De&s;olation, an A|maze, a Horror upon all Creatures of Sen&s;e, and e&s;pecially of Rea&s;on; an Affrightment and Ter|ror upon Nature it &s;elf; becau&s;e hereby the great Laws, and Sanctions of Creation, and Providence, are violated. For concerning the Earth, <HI>God &s;pake, and it was done; he commanded, and it &s;tood fa&s;t,</HI> P&s;al. 33.9.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Earth is &s;tuff'd with variety of Matter, Humours, and Vapors in its Bowels; Fire, Water, Vapor, Air, Minerals, Sulphur, Piceous Matter. Now it &s;elf is &s;o made, as to lye clo&s;e, and to lye &s;till; every clod of Earth compacts it &s;elf, and would
<PB N="136" REF="87"> lye in as little room as it can. It is heavy, and &s;luggi&s;h, and unapt to move; whereas all the re&s;t of its Inmates are for Motion and Action, &s;ome of them of very earne&s;t and vigorous Motion, and for Propagation and Enlargement of them&s;elves: The Earth will not move, but on &s;ome great vio|lence and force; &s;o when tho&s;e working and active Parts find they are fettered, and impri&s;oned, and cramp'd, they grow furious and outragious, and rend and tear every thing, to make and force their way; and all on the &s;udden and at once ve|ry often; for being either gather'd together in great Caverns and Hollows of the Earth; their Room grows too &s;trait and little, and &s;o they are forc'd to tran&s;plant them&s;elves; or having, as one may &s;ay, very often a Spirit of Contradiction one to another, they fall into Feuds and Wars one with another, and they that are overcome and fall under the Ma&s;tery of others, are forc'd, and driven, and made to fly, out with great violence: and the very &s;ame thing may fall out in divers le&s;&s;er Veins and Tubular Pa&s;&s;ages or Pipes in the Earth; where though the Stores of the&s;e Vapors or Mineral Spirits are le&s;&s;er; yet if it be in many of them together, the Conte&s;t may be very great, and the Fury very di&s;compo&s;ing to the Earth.</P>
<P>Thus there are within the Earth tho&s;e Bombs and Mortars, tho&s;e Cannon and Ordnance, tho&s;e Battering Rams and Engines, tho&s;e Mines oft &s;prung, and natural Gun-powder and fiery Bul|lets, tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Screwed Guns: all which are the Ammunition of Nature, or rather of the God of Nature: Thus when they are di&s;charg'd, and let off, it is with great Noi&s;e, Dread, and A&s;toni&s;h|ment,
<PB N="137" REF="87"> and oftentimes De&s;truction to the Inhabi|tants of the Earth. Who almo&s;t hath not heard of <HI>Aetna</HI> and <HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI> and other the Mountains &s;pouting Fire in &s;everal Parts of the World? And as there are &s;uch con&s;tant, known, and open E|ruptions in Nature, &s;o are there &s;ecret, &s;udden, and extemporary ones.</P>
<P>And thus in the Heavens over us there are like Conte&s;ts and Colli&s;ions, falling, and clapping of Clouds, Thunders, Lightnings, fiery Meteors, and flaming Balls, and the&s;e often corre&s;ponding, and as it were holding Intelligence, with the &s;ame in Earth. And the&s;e are certainly often Cau&s;es one of another by the Tone or Link of Air being broken, and the <HI>Ela&s;tic</HI> Force or Spring of it flying this way and that way; as lately in <HI>Ja|maica</HI> according to the mo&s;t prudent Accounts from thence: Every thing then mu&s;t needs be torn and havock'd, as tho&s;e Motions hurry this way or that way, Per&s;ons, Animal Creatures, and Things, at &s;uch times.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e are in the World of Nature; &s;o are they in the <HI>Political</HI> World; when Nations or People are too full for their Place, and tran&s;plant them&s;elves by forcing into other Nations; when Wars, tho&s;e great Di&s;putes of Nations ari&s;e; when People or Armies fall into Mutiny; the&s;e are Political Earthquakes; and when Men are op|pre&s;&s;ed in Religion by domineering Super&s;tition, and Laws of <HI>&V;niformity,</HI> and impo&s;ing on the Con&s;ciences and Faith of Men; There are Religious <HI>Earthquakes:</HI> The P&s;almi&s;t puts them altogether, P&s;al. 65.7, 8. <HI>Which &s;etteth fa&s;t the Mountains being girded with Power; which &s;tille&s;t the noi&s;e
<PB N="138" REF="88"> of the Seas, the noi&s;e of their Waves,</HI> and the <HI>multitude of the People.</HI> This God does in Mer|cy, when he keeps all quiet; but there are Times when all the&s;e being in Hubbub and Mutiny, <HI>the Mountains &s;hake</HI> and <HI>roar</HI> together with the <HI>Seas</HI> and <HI>Waves;</HI> and the <HI>Multitude</HI> of People in their <HI>Strivings;</HI> who are therein emphatically called <HI>the Mobile;</HI> that <HI>They that dwell in the utter|mo&s;t Parts are afraid of the&s;e Tokens;</HI> thus from one end of Nations, or even of the World, to another, there ari&s;e dreadful Fears at the <HI>Tokens of God,</HI> unhinging the World; called therefore <HI>Prodigies</HI> and <HI>Portents:</HI> For what Intere&s;t God hath in the&s;e, &s;hall be &s;poken in the next Parti|cular.</P>
<P>I only ob&s;erve further, There are in the Little World by the wre&s;tling of contrary Humours in the Bodies of Men, &s;uch Spoutings of Fire, as in Fevers; &s;uch Deluges of Water, as in Drop&s;ies; &s;uch Earthquakes in violent Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;uch &s;ulphu|reous Vapors in horrid Melancholies or Fits; or in the Arteries and Sinews, as in Gouts and Rheuma|ti&s;ms; in tho&s;e Arthritical Pains in the &s;trait and clo&s;e Tubes of the Body; &s;uch Swimmings of the Head, as re&s;emble what hath been &s;poken of in the outer World; but above all in Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let all the&s;e things be trac'd, as much as they can to their natural Cau&s;es; yet Scripture a&s;cribes all to God, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 148.8. <HI>Fire, Hail, Snow, Vapor, all fulfil his Word: He worketh his Signs and Wonders among the Armies of Heaven and the Inhabitants of the Earth,</HI> and <HI>none can &s;tay his hand;</HI> (for all the <HI>Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.35.)
<PB N="139" REF="88"> except he plea&s;es to &s;tay it him&s;elf; or <HI>can &s;ay to him, What do&s;t thou?</HI> As if they &s;hould &s;ay What do&s;t thou mean, who ha&s;t <HI>made Heaven and Earth,</HI> and pre&s;erve&s;t it; to put it into the&s;e Di&s;orders?

<P>But God indeed does in more lofty Style, and Elegancies, and Eloquences of Language, a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the Government of the&s;e affrightful Motions in Heaven, or Earth; <HI>Thun|ders, Lightnings, Earthquakes</HI> throughout Scri|pture; as if they were immediately done by his own hand, as if he took this Globe of Earth and Sea, which he hath <HI>Hung upon nothing,</HI> and <HI>&s;hook it out of its place;</HI> or as if he immediately &s;hot off his great Pieces either in the Bowels of the Earth, or in the Skies, or &s;prung a Mine in the Earth: And it mu&s;t needs be &s;o; if all natural, voluntary and fortuitous (as we Poreblind think them) Cau&s;es work in and out of his hand. For if in the Killing <HI>King Ahab a man drew a Bow at a venture;</HI> or as in the Margin out of the <HI>He|brew; In his Simplicity,</HI> without De&s;ign, with|out Aim, and yet it was directed to <HI>Ahab,</HI> as by God's immediate Hand to fulfil his Word up|on him, How much more are all natural Cau&s;es directed by him! 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 22.34. And tho&s;e Things which he knows will with &s;uch extraordi|nary Amazes change the World; he a&s;cribes them

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. The <HI>Earthquake</HI> that &s;hall be at the <HI>Ri&s;ing of the Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> when that Great City, who&s;e <HI>Emblem</HI> is <HI>Ten,</HI> or <HI>Tenth;</HI> in regard of the <HI>Ten Kings,</HI> who give their <HI>Kingdom to the Bea&s;t,</HI> that

<P>Now that <HI>Earthquake</HI> nam'd la&s;t, but this la&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fall of the great <HI>Antichri&s;tian</HI> State, I affirm to be &s;o near as 1697. approaching; wherein the Kingdom of Chri&s;t &s;hall be in its Suc|ce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Now what ari&s;es from all this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inference.</NOTE> but that it may both urge the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and give all Invitations and Incitements to Repentance; which cannot be higher expre&s;s'd than in the Apo&s;tle's own Words, as 'tis us'd in this Context. Let us <HI>have Grace,</HI> or rather Take Hold, lay earne&s;t Hold of Divine <HI>Grace,</HI> and Pow|er in Chri&s;t; that we may <HI>&s;erve him with Reve|rence,</HI> or all Holy Awes of Mode&s;ty and Shamefa|cedne&s;s, as the <HI>Angels</HI> that <HI>cover Faces</HI> and <HI>Feet,</HI> le&s;t we give di&s;ta&s;te; and with good <HI>Heed-taking,</HI> as the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> that kept within bounds, le&s;t God &s;hould have broken out; And this Service of God with holy <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> and &s;hame of our own Unworthine&s;s and horrid Nakedne&s;s; This Good <HI>Heed-taking</HI> not to run into God as a <HI>Con&s;uming Fire,</HI> is mo&s;t &s;hewn, exercis'd and practis'd in timely Repentance. For all at that Day of <HI>Earthquake, Thunders</HI> and <HI>Lightnings, once for All,</HI> All mu&s;t be near; for God will <HI>come near to them,</HI> as a <HI>&s;wift Witne&s;s;</HI> and to

<P>And to this purpo&s;e, Let the&s;e very late <HI>Moti|ons of the Earth</HI> be con&s;ider'd in all the forego|ing Di&s;cour&s;e; for I cannot but be per&s;waded, they are Pledges of that great Change, that &s;hall &s;uddenly be in the World in the Fall of the whole <HI>Papal</HI> and <HI>Antichri&s;tian State;</HI> be&s;ides their ge|neral &s;trong Motive to <HI>Repentance,</HI> as they &s;peak God, both in his Divine Power, and Ability to execute Wrath; as al&s;o in his <HI>Goodne&s;s, Long-&s;uffering,</HI> and <HI>Patience, leading to Repentance;</HI> and how much more, if the Approach of his Kingdom it &s;elf, the greate&s;t <HI>Motive to Repen|tance</HI> be by it declar'd &s;o near.</P>
<P>That I may therefore improve &s;o remarkable a Providence upon the <HI>Engli&s;h Plantation</HI> in <HI>Ja|maica,</HI> (which is therefore to be reputed a part of <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf) and the &s;o gentle and tender Admonition of that Motion of the Earth among our Selves (as al&s;o on other Parts) I would di&s;|cour&s;e them fir&s;t, as an Argument to Repentance, and then, that they are a Prediction of a great Change on the World.</P>
<P N="1">1. I fir&s;t con&s;ider that of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which, we mu&s;t needs acknowledge a part of our Selves; and therefore it is to be looked upon as <HI>Eng|land,</HI> though beyond the Sea; and &s;o we are all equally therein concerned, particularly that many of us had Intere&s;ts, and Relations that &s;uffered in it; we are therefore nearly concern'd; and &s;o are &s;trongly called upon to Repentance by it; and the more, that it fell &s;o particularly upon that Town or Port, that bore the En&s;igns of So|vereignty
<PB N="149" REF="93"> and Government, called <HI>Port Royal;</HI> that was the <HI>Key of the I&s;land</HI> and Plantation, the Port and Harbor, the Seat of the <HI>Kings</HI> Hou&s;e, and of the Hou&s;es of the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble <HI>Merchants</HI> and Traders; and of the Defence and Strength of the Place, by its <HI>Ba&s;tions</HI> and Fortifications.</P>
<P N="2">2. I con&s;ider, that the Judgment bears a very great Re&s;emblance to the Judgment on <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah;</HI> For the Thunder, and Lightning, and Balls of Fire that came down from Heaven; according to the mo&s;t credible Accounts of Eye-witne&s;&s;es; though the Town was not, that I have heard, touched by the Fire, carry the Signatures of <HI>Sodom</HI>'s Judgment after a &s;erene <HI>Ri&s;ing</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> which mu&s;t be by an <HI>Earthquake</HI> and <HI>In|undation;</HI> for the <HI>Earthquake</HI> and <HI>Inundation</HI> was in the Suddenne&s;s, and dreadful De&s;olation, and De&s;truction that it made, How like to that which turn'd <HI>Sodom</HI> into a <HI>Lake</HI> or <HI>Dead Sea</HI> to this day! And herein what was &s;hort of <HI>Sodom</HI>'s Judgment in the Fire, was made up in the Dread of the <HI>Earthquake:</HI> and &s;o many, about 2000 Per&s;ons peri&s;hed, as by that newly &s;ober publi&s;h|ed Account before nam'd appears; <HI>A Shade of the Place, and of the Parts on which the Earth|quake had greate&s;t Power is given in it.</HI></P>
<P>From hence then I argue;</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is not to be a&s;crib'd to natural Cau|&s;es any other way, than as the &s;upreme Coun&s;el and Being hath all Cau&s;es in his Hand, and at his Di&s;po&s;e. If it had been only an <HI>Earthquake</HI> and <HI>Inundation,</HI> there had appeared le&s;s of God, and of his Supream Dominion; But when there was
<PB N="150" REF="94"> a Corre&s;pondence, and as it were Intelligence be|tween Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, above and be|low; It leads us to con&s;ider Him, <HI>Who does whatever he plea&s;es in Heaven and in Earth, and in all Deep Places.</HI> He cau&s;eth the Vapors to a&s;cend from the Earth, He maketh Lightnings for the Rain, He bringeth the Wind out of his Trea&s;ures, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 135.6, 7. Were not Men re&s;ol|ved, as <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> to <HI>&s;tand</HI> up like <HI>Rock</HI> again&s;t God they mu&s;t needs acknowledge Him in this: The Works of God, his Judgment on <HI>Sodom</HI> of old, is an <HI>En&s;ample</HI> to all After Ages; How much more This &s;o upon our own Times, on whom the <HI>Ends of the World are come;</HI> though we had no &s;hare in it, but it was upon another People; How much more when &s;o upon our Selves, though in another Climate!</P>
<P N="2">2. I con&s;ider, as a further Argument to Re|pentance herein that great Scripture <HI>Amos</HI> 4.6. That it comes upon this Nation in a Train, and Connexion of Judgments; all within le&s;s than half the <HI>Age of a Man</HI> at <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Computation:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Or</HI> 70 <HI>Years,</HI> P&s;al. 90.10.</NOTE> The Pe&s;tilence and Dreadful Plague in the Year 1665. The Fire on this City in 1666. The &s;everal Inte&s;tine Commotions, and Wars a|broad: And now it is come to this Judgment, though but on &s;ome of us; yet it was but &s;o up|on <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> v. 11. <HI>I have overthrown &s;ome of you,</HI> as <HI>God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</HI> And this is the la&s;t, till God come to a Judgment &s;o great, he would not name; <HI>Therefore will I do Thus, or this, unto thee. Therefore prepare to meet thy God, Oh I&s;rael,</HI> in his &s;evere&s;t Judgment,
<PB N="151" REF="94"> if thou <HI>return not.</HI> And &s;o according to the ge|neral cour&s;e of the Word and Dealings of God, e&s;pecially with a People under &s;uch a clearne&s;s of Divine Revelation as we are: It mu&s;t needs be, whether Men will <HI>Hear or Forbear.</HI> It mu&s;t end in utter De&s;truction, if upon this we do not <HI>Re|turn to God,</HI> according (I &s;ay) to the General Rules, and Standards of his Word.</P>
<P N="3">3. That great Admonition of our Saviour's is an utter Prohibition of our &s;heltring our &s;elves under &s;uch an Imagination, that they were <HI>greater Sinners</HI> than we are; for he hath &s;olemnly de|nounced, That whoever does not <HI>Repent,</HI> &s;hall not only <HI>Peri&s;h,</HI> but &s;hall <HI>Peri&s;h</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> <HI>in like manner</HI> with tho&s;e, who have <HI>Peri&s;h'd</HI> by extraordinary, and mo&s;t eminent, and remarkable Judgments, <HI>Luc.</HI> 13.3, 5. So that without <HI>Repen|tance</HI> we are always under the Impendency, the hanging over of &s;o great Judgments upon us; as came indeed upon the <HI>Jews</HI> in the <HI>Roman De&s;ola|tions</HI> &s;oon after; and mu&s;t upon this Nation ac|cording to ordinary Rules, and Standards of the Word, and Providence of God, as I have &s;aid: But if not; &s;eeing that Word of Chri&s;t &s;hall be true, that we &s;hall <HI>likewi&s;e peri&s;h,</HI> if we do <HI>not Repent;</HI> We mu&s;t be rai&s;ed to that Greate&s;t <HI>Earthquake, Thunder,</HI> and <HI>Lightning,</HI> and the Dreadful <HI>Tempe&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Snares, Fire</HI> and <HI>Brim|&s;tone</HI> God will then Rain, and the <HI>Horrible Tem|pe&s;t,</HI> that &s;hall be the Portion of every wicked and impenitent Per&s;on's <HI>Cup,</HI> P&s;al. 11.6. at that Time, that Day, that &s;hall <HI>burn as an Oven,</HI> and <HI>con&s;ume the Wicked Root and Branch;</HI> at that <HI>Battel</HI> of the <HI>Great Day of God Almighty</HI> in the

But I will only &s;hew what I can Do, and I will <HI>Do you no hurt.</HI> Oh that this <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>Goodne&s;s, Long &s;uffering</HI> and <HI>Patience,</HI> might <HI>lead us to Repentance!</HI> who him&s;elf <HI>&s;taid his own Hand,</HI> and &s;aid to Him&s;elf, <HI>What am I doing?</HI> (when none el&s;e could) and <HI>He did it not.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Second Head I propos'd, for the Improvement of our Thoughts on the&s;e <HI>Earthquakes</HI> in general, but particularly of that but ju&s;t, a <HI>Motion</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> in this City, and the Royal Camp, and other parts beyond the Sea; That it is predictive, and foretelling of a great Change in the World: And of this I give the&s;e following Arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is beyond all denial mo&s;t evident, that Scripture makes u&s;e of <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> as the Con|veyance of its De&s;cription of the great Works and
<PB N="154" REF="96"> Changes God will make for the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> till it appears: That cour&s;e of Earthquakes Providence hath been in of late years, is &s;urely a Declaration of tho&s;e great Changes he is about to make, fir&s;t by the Succe&s;&s;ion of that <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and then by its own Appearance: For if fir&s;t Chri&s;t convey his <HI>Kingdom</HI> by <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> as <HI>Types</HI> and Pledges; it is but rea&s;onable to expect, when he alarms the World with <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> he has &s;omething to do more than ordinary in the Advancement of it; el&s;e his &s;o great u&s;e of them in his Word would be but as the <HI>&s;ounding of the Mountains,</HI> and <HI>Amu&s;e</HI> in vain. By the &s;o often u&s;e of <HI>Earthquakes</HI> he teaches us to expect by them; Seeing as on one &s;ide he u&s;es <HI>Earth|quakes</HI> in his Word to expre&s;s great Things for his <HI>Kingdom</HI> by; &s;o on the other &s;ide he u&s;es <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> that are &s;o in Fact to and in his <HI>Pro|vidence,</HI> to foretell &s;ome Changes for his <HI>King|dom</HI> following them, according to his Word.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Nations, and Places, where this Moti|on of the Earth came, are &s;uch, as are clo&s;ely concerned in the Change, that God is about to make; being either of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion, or of the <HI>Ten Kings,</HI> that yet <HI>give their King|dom to the Bea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>That God was pleas'd therefore to guide the Motion of unquiet Vapors over &s;o many Coun|tries and Cities, it was like the &s;ending the <HI>Cup</HI> and <HI>Yoke</HI> in <HI>Jeremy</HI> to &s;o many Nations, on whom he would execute his Di&s;plea&s;ure by <HI>Nebuchadnez|zar,</HI> Jerem. c. 25. c. 27. &s;o now he hath &s;ent by this <HI>Earthquake,</HI> as it were by a Me&s;&s;enger, to make known to the Nations his <HI>Kingdom</HI> &s;o near. For &s;o mild and gentle a Motion, that had no|thing of Wrath, and execution of Vengeance
<PB N="155" REF="96"> in its Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;eems entru&s;ted only with &s;o great a Notice. And I cannot but hope, and am even a&s;&s;ured, That this City is to bear &s;o happy a Part in the <HI>Kingdom of Christ,</HI> that it &s;hall be <HI>pre&s;erved</HI> for his <HI>Servant</HI> David<HI>'s &s;ake,</HI> and that God in Chri&s;t is the <HI>Holy one in the mid&s;t of it.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. That which above all a&s;&s;ures me &s;o, is That <HI>Sure Word of Prophecy;</HI> that Time is &s;o near for the Succe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> (which is by <HI>Prophecy</HI> de&s;crib'd by a great <HI>Earth|quake</HI>) that I can under&s;tand nothing by this Move; but that Introducing, or Bringing it in with the <HI>Call of the Witne&s;&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Fall of the Tenth</HI> of <HI>the Great City:</HI> For I cannot under&s;tand that there is Space or Room for any other Change but of That to the <HI>Kingdom of Chri&s;t,</HI> entring into its <HI>Succe&s;&s;ion;</HI> wherein all &s;hall have the Ad|vantages of Repentance and Reformation by the <HI>pouring out of the Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>Preaching of the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel;</HI> even to all the World; and the Converts of that Time &s;hall be, as the <HI>Drops of Dew from the Womb of the Morning:</HI> A Change of &s;o great advantages to the World, that none have any rea&s;on to be offended, or to complain of the Tydings; except They, <HI>who hate to be Reform'd.</HI> I de&s;ire no other <HI>Beauty of Feet</HI> or <HI>Face</HI> than to <HI>bring</HI> and <HI>pub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h</HI> it. It is all holy, pure, &s;piritual, benign, and beneficent, to tho&s;e who have but any De&s;ires after God Chri&s;t, and Goodne&s;s, both in inward and outward Boun|ties: There is greate&s;t rea&s;on it &s;hould be <HI>dai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y prayed for,</HI> and <HI>daily it is to be prai&s;ed; Verily,</HI> It may be &s;aid, <HI>Many Kings, Prophets,</HI> and <HI>Righteous Men have de&s;ired to &s;ee the Things</HI> that &s;hall then be &s;een; and <HI>have not &s;een them;</HI> and to <HI>hear the Things that &s;hall then be heard,</HI>
<PB N="156" REF="97"> and have not <HI>heard them.</HI> Oh therefore, that this may be what this gracious Heave of the Earth does pre&s;age; (as I have great A&s;&s;urance it does,) That there is no more danger by it, than this, That we &s;hould take notice; This Earth with great Sedatene&s;s gave a Motion with joy, as <HI>John Bapti&s;t in the Womb</HI> to foretell; It is <HI>with all its King<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">oms</HI> &s;oon to become <HI>the Kingdom of the Lord</HI> and of <HI>his Chri&s;t,</HI> wherein <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hall dwell:</HI> That &s;oon after, upon a Purifi|cation from all Defilements the <HI>Heavens</HI> over it, and it &s;elf, may become a <HI>New Heaven</HI> and a <HI>New Earth;</HI> and the <HI>Will of God done</HI> as in parallel, as in that <HI>Heaven,</HI> and upon <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But though I have endeavoured to make good my way all along; yet I would in the Conclu&s;ion give a more &s;olemn An&s;wer to the chief Objecti|ons, I have taken notice of.</P>
<P><HI>Objct.</HI> 1. Some of the &s;agacious Ob&s;ervers of Nature have &s;o trac'd extraordinary Events to their Cau&s;es, that they have foretold particularly Earth|quakes, by ob&s;erving the Ripene&s;s of natural Cau|&s;es for them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Whatever Ob&s;ervations the wi&s;e&s;t of Mankind have made, they are not able, &s;o far to penetrate the Screws of Natural Cau&s;es, fitted to the nece&s;&s;itating one another to &s;uch Effects; but that &s;upernatural Agents may give a <HI>Lift</HI> to the <HI>Wheels</HI> of Second Cau&s;es, that u&s;ually <HI>move,</HI> but <HI>on Earth,</HI> viz. in a natural way; to move much <HI>above Earth,</HI> that is, Supernaturally: and in the &s;ame manner to &s;et Bars to, or hinder their Motions. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 1.19.20.</P>
<P>Now that there are &s;uch Supernatural Agents; the very Evidences of rational, and even &s;en&s;ible Experiments compel the &s;toute&s;t Gain&s;ayers to
<PB N="157" REF="97"> confe&s;s, but as they bid defiance to all Things for the &s;ake of their <HI>Athei&s;tic</HI> Sentiments.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. He that <HI>Knows all his Works</HI> from <HI>the very Foundation of the World,</HI> and fore&s;ees All Cau&s;es and Effects, could with the &s;ame Ea&s;e ballance them for their ju&s;t Time, both as to par|ticular Per&s;ons, and Nations with their Sins <HI>filling up their mea&s;ure;</HI> and &s;o that All &s;hould roll down to their highe&s;t Effects at that time when he will <HI>once more &s;hake, not only Earth</HI> but <HI>Heaven al&s;o;</HI> even at that <HI>Time of Trouble,</HI> and <HI>Day of Battel and War,</HI> as it is mo&s;t <HI>Prophetically</HI> call'd <HI>Job</HI> 38.22.23. compar'd with <HI>Dan.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Mat.</HI> 24.21. and <HI>Revel.</HI> 16.14. the &s;ame Spirit that dicta|ted All, Fitting the very Words one to another in the&s;e Scriptures.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. But &s;till, If this be allowed, that &s;uch natural Cau&s;es and Effects are adju&s;ted for the Purpo&s;es of Divine Judgment, and even for that Di&s;&s;olution of this pre&s;ent Frame, Why at this Time?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Such a Time according to all Scripture and Rea&s;on mu&s;t be at &s;ome Time; and why may it not be now &s;o near?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. The very Time &s;ince the <HI>Coming of Chri&s;t</HI> fir&s;t <HI>in the Fle&s;h</HI> being almo&s;t 1700 Years ago, was call'd the <HI>Fulne&s;s of Time;</HI> what then can be after it, but the <HI>Ends of the World,</HI> the <HI>La&s;t Day,</HI> the <HI>La&s;t Hour,</HI> running apace to the <HI>Fulne&s;s of all Times?</HI> Gal. 4.4. and Ephe&s;. 1.10.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT may &s;eem un&s;ea&s;onable, and mo|ro&s;e, to deny the value of any kind of Repentance, in &s;uch an Age as this; wherein there is a Generation ari&s;en, Oh how lofty are their Eyes, and their Eye-lids lifted up with Scorn and Di&s;dain of all Reli|gion! An Age &s;o irreligious, that it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to gather up all the Frag|ments, tho but of a &s;eeming Piety, and make the most of them, rather than to call things to &s;o &s;trict a Ballance: A thinner, and more dilute Repentance, than would formerly have admitted a Man into a vi&s;ible Church, may at
<PB REF="101"> &s;uch a time as this, hope for Heaven.</P>
<P>To all this I mu&s;t an&s;wer, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Loo&s;ene&s;s of an Age does not &s;lac|ken or di&s;&s;olve Eternal Laws; Wi&s;|dom abates nothing of its price, of that timely and early &s;earch after it, whether Men think good to give it, or whether they will forbear. It hath no meaner E&s;teem of it &s;elf, becau&s;e Folly, that is, &s;imple, and knoweth nothing, &s;itteth upon the high places of the City, full of Noi&s;e and Clamor, and entices to its Entertainments the Multitude, and Grandeur of the World.</P>
<P>All the Severities of Scripture, that make the way to Heaven narrow, and the Gate &s;trait, &s;tand like a Rock, from Generation to Generation, alike in all times. Nothing that is prodi|gally loo&s;ed on Earth, in compliance with a licentious Age, will be there|fore loo&s;ed in Heaven.</P>
<P>The goodly price of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> at which God is priz'd by Men, even then, when Religion is at the lowest, is rejected ofte&s;t with Indigna|tion,
<PB REF="101"> and the everla&s;ting State pur|cha&s;ed by it, may be &s;adly called <HI>an Aceldama, a Field of Blood.</HI></P>
<P>If this Severity of Divine Truth offend any one, The Re&s;olution is that of our Saviour.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">Mat. 15.17.</NOTE> Every Plant, whether Per&s;on or Thing, that our Heavenly Father hath not planted, &s;hall be rooted up.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> It is no improbable way of Con|te&s;ting against Athei&s;m, and general Irreligion, by the &s;trict Doctrins of Chri&s;tianity, as well as by Argu|ments of Rea&s;on: Nay, Authorita|tive Applications of the Truth of God, often &s;trike the Con&s;cience with|in the Rea&s;on, &s;ooner and quicker than indu&s;trious Attempts upon the Rea&s;on: as Lightning melts the Steel, and neg|lects the Scabbard. Pre&s;&s;ings of Faith, Repentance, Holine&s;s, Eternal Judg|ment make Men (even &V;nbelievers) fall down upon their faces, when the Se|crets of their Hearts are di&s;covered, and confe&s;s God is there</P>
<PB REF="102">
<P>For the Soul of Man is more ea&s;ily wrought upon by tho&s;e dome&s;tick Re|bukes, God gives it by his Word, than by more &s;olemn Treaties.</P>
<P>E&s;pecially, corrupted Rea&s;on takes upon it &s;elf to be a lawful Authority, when an honourable War is commen|ced again&s;t it by the better Rea&s;on on the other &s;ide; It contemns Laws of Di&s;cour&s;e, as precarious, and makes account, it gives Rea&s;on for Rea&s;on. But the Rod of God &s;haken over it makes it tremble, and confe&s;s it &s;elf a Slave: Thus the Slaves in the Sto|ry were more ea&s;ily reduced by the &s;er|vile Cha&s;ti&s;ements they were acquainted with, than by the force of Armies. Athei&s;m grows the prouder generally for being rea&s;oned with: It does but di&s;&s;emble, while it pretends its di&s;ea&s;e to be in the Head, which it knows in|deed to be in the &s;en&s;ual Heart. And therefore is plea&s;ed to be &s;truck in the Head; but cannot endure to be wounded in the Heart, which the Word of God e&s;pecially aims at.</P>
<PB REF="102">
<P>Not, but that it is indeed a mo&s;t generous and honourable Atchieve|ment to &s;hew Religion to be the high|e&s;t Rea&s;on; and to detect tho&s;e pre|tending Sons of Rea&s;on, of the great|e&s;t Irrationality. But it is &s;till to be acknowledged, the plain preaching of the Go&s;pel, which the Apo&s;tle calls the Fooli&s;hne&s;s and Weakne&s;s of God, is alone wi&s;er and &s;tronger than Men: The Rea&s;on of that, couched under an Heavenly Authority of Truth, car|ries tho&s;e <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, tho&s;e migh|ty Weapons, whereby every high Ima|gination and Rea&s;oning is to be &s;ub|dued, that lifts up it &s;elf again&s;t God.</P>
<P>&V;pon this occa&s;ion, I cannot, but bewail tho&s;e unhappy Divi&s;ions, that have &s;eparated the Preachers of the Go&s;pel one from another, and there|by opened a Lane for that Black Troop to advance in, and made the Trum|pet of the Go&s;pel to &s;ound &s;o incertain|ly, that it hath rather &s;cattered Men, than prepared them to the Battel.</P>

From whence it follows, where ever this &V;nion is broken, Chri|&s;tianity is liable to the Imputations of being a great Cheat and Fraud. &V;pon which advantage loath&s;ome Irreligion enters, and &s;preads it &s;elf in tho&s;e empty &s;paces, begotten by our Di&s;tan|ces, and removes from one another: All divi&s;ions in Chri&s;tianity are Scan|dals to it, and weaken it. This we &s;ee verified in our days; the differences in Religion, and the prophane &s;corn or &s;tupid neglect of it, being alike vi&s;ible, and notorious throughout the Nation.</P>
<PB REF="103">
<P>Yet upon ju&s;t Accounts: the Irreli|gion con&s;equent upon Divi&s;ions in Re|ligion, turns to the advantage of Chri|&s;tianity, that thus it mu&s;t be, el&s;e how &s;hould the Scriptures be fulfilled? But this abates nothing of the Sinfulne&s;s and &V;n|happine&s;s, or Nece&s;&s;ity of Amendment.</P>
<P>To guide us then into that; It is ve|ry ob&s;ervable, the venom of this Di|&s;temper falls not &s;o much upon the &s;eve|ral Parties in Religion, as upon Reli|gion it &s;elf; while we <HI>wound</HI> one ano|ther, Religion is the <HI>Martyr,</HI> lies a bleeding, and even dying.

<P>The method of Cure therefore, is not, for every Party to weigh up it &s;elf, and pre&s;s down others, but to buoy up Re|ligion it &s;elf; and that is be&s;t done, by Preaching and living <HI>the very Thing,</HI> without di&s;tinction of Names.

<P>For as our human Nature would be much more beautiful and happy, if cemented by that <HI>Philanthropy,</HI> or general love of Mankind, &s;o indear|ingly charged upon us by our Saviour; who demon&s;trated, that he embraced within his own Immen&s;ity, the whole latitude of our Nature, without con|tracting it into the narrowne&s;s of a human Per&s;on, by the great care he took; That this Nature &s;hould not be di&s;honoured, abu&s;ed, and torn by it &s;elf through that bitter Cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s, Revenge, and Contempt, Men exerci&s;e upon one another, even there where Chri&s;t is profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>So would our Chri&s;tianity, that is now evil &s;poken of, appear, as it is in it &s;elf, Acceptable to God, and appro|ved of Men, if we could unite in tho&s;e comprehen&s;ive Intere&s;ts of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, Peace, Joy in the Holy-Gho&s;t, that &s;ub&s;tantial Chri&s;tianity; Tho&s;e healing Wings of the Sun of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,

How great is the ne|ce&s;&s;ity then of living well, that we may dye well! For this <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> that ri&s;es and &s;ets at the &s;ame time, generally proves but a falling Star.

<PB REF="105"> (when true) among Miracles.

<P>Yet I have not trusted the weight of the Di&s;cour&s;e to any thing that looks like a private Opinion; but to mo&s;t avowed Principles, and have therefore re&s;erved my particular Sen&s;e as the Conclu&s;ion of the whole.</P>
<P>I have only to add, there is a Na|tional late Repentance, as appears by the &V;n&s;uccesfulne&s;s of that unparal|lell'd<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="marg">2 Kings 23.26. and 24.3, 4.</NOTE> Reformation of <HI>Jo|&s;iah;</HI> &s;incere indeed in him, and of full Effect: but not in the Body of the

<P>THE generality of Men that have been at all acquainted with the name of Repentance, and under&s;tood in any Mea&s;ure the im|portance and &s;ignification of the thing, acknowledge it beyond all di&s;pute nece&s;&s;ary: Yet they allow
<PB N="2" REF="107"> them&s;elves a lei&s;ure for the Performance of it, and &s;uch a lei&s;ure as &s;wallows the whole time of Life, and leaves only the la&s;t and lowe&s;t part of it, for the di&s;charge of &s;o great a Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o that their Repentance, if any at all, falls out to be a <HI>Death-bed Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>The inconveniencies of which are unexpre&s;&s;ibly great, becau&s;e the lives of Men are left naked of that Holine&s;s and Purity, that &s;hould adorn them, and all over blotted with Sin and Vanity. Their Conver&s;ation wants <HI>that light of good Works, that &s;hould &s;hine before Men, and glorifie God in Heaven. Their Life is without form, and void, and darkne&s;s is upon the face of it.</HI> And in the end they are ca&s;t upon the great Sea of Eternity, as in a Ve&s;&s;el of Paper, a thin and &s;uperficial Repentance.</P>
<P>It is therefore mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e all means, to &s;hew the In&s;ufficiency of this Refuge, which mo&s;t of tho&s;e, that live in common under the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, de&s;ign while they live to fly to when betimes they dye. To demoli&s;h <HI>this Hou&s;e upon the Sand;</HI> that Men may not by hopes of &s;hel|ter at it, conceived long before hand, be kept off from laying <HI>their Foundation upon a Rock;</HI> which po&s;&s;ibly they would do, if the&s;e hopes were cut off.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e this piece of Sacred Story hath been generally taken, as an In&s;tance of great Favour to a late Conver&s;ion, not that it is indeed &s;o, but that it &s;eems to be &s;o, let it be the Ground of the pre|&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>For I ob&s;erve Divines, in their Doctrin concern|ing the danger of a Dying Repentance, are careful to wre&s;t out of the hand of pre&s;uming Imagina|tion,
<PB N="3" REF="107"> this Example, and to allay the vain Confidence built upon it.</P>
<P>Indeed the Mi&s;take of it is very fatal, &s;eeing if it be duly con&s;idered, there is nothing more forcible again&s;t what it is pretended for, than it. It is true, it is a Relation of a dying Man returning from great Sins to God; but &s;o circum&s;tantiated, &s;o defended on all hands again&s;t Boldne&s;s upon it, that there might have been more rea&s;on to hope well of La&s;t-Breath-Penitencies, if there had not been a Pat|tern of &s;uch a one in all Points, as much above the imitiation of tho&s;e of our days, as the Heaven is above the Earth. It is &s;uch a one, as if God had &s;aid of it, if I accept a Dying Repentance; be|hold this, con&s;ider it every way, and take notice by it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ante mihi fi|dem latronis o&s;tende, &amp; tunc tibi latronis beatitudinem policere. <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI></NOTE> what a one I will have it. God putting the Ca&s;e, and re&s;olving it thus, hath given a much more po&s;itive De|termination concerning it, than if the Ca&s;e had never been put.</P>
<P>The End therefore I aim at, is to make it evident upon general Rea&s;ons, and particularly from this In&s;tance.</P>
<P>That a <HI>Death-bed Repentance</HI> is a hazard &s;o un|&s;peakably great, that no Man can without Folly ex|treamly prodigious commit to &s;o much adventure an affair of &s;o great importance to an eternal condition.</P>
<P>Hereunto I will rai&s;e this Treaty by the&s;e degrees.</P>
<P N="1">1. By ob&s;erving the Judgment of Divines con|cerning this Ca&s;e, and balancing the mo&s;t favour|able with the more &s;evere.</P>
<P N="2">2. By detecting the Follies that have given a Re|putation to a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="108">
<P N="3">3. By examining the mo&s;t hopeful Appearances of this kind of Repentance, and &s;hewing there are plain Cau&s;es of them very much below the Nature of true Repentance, wherewith I will compare them.</P>
<P N="4">4. By ob&s;erving the Extraordinaries, of which the Repentance of this Dying Malefactor was com|po&s;ed, becau&s;e of which it can hardly be drawn into a Precedent.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e I will &s;ubjoin pre&s;&s;ing Con&s;iderations on every &s;ide; that Men &s;hould not delay their re|turn to God, to the latter Times of Life.</P>
<P>For the Fir&s;t, the Judgment of Divines in the Point, I begin with that &s;everer one;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s Invalidity of a late Repen|tance.</NOTE> yet built upon great Piety and Rea&s;on, that a&s;&s;erts it a plainly impo&s;&s;ible thing, a Man on his Death-Bed &s;hould Repent with that Repentance, the Scripture &s;o oft Di&s;cour&s;es of, and promi&s;es Pardon to, and threatens the neglect of, with Peri&s;hing; and there|fore concludes, a Dying Man that hath not already repented, mu&s;t needs fall, not into the Sin of De&s;pair. For who is bound to hope, that hath not the rea&s;ons of his hope given him by God? but into the Mi&s;ery of De&s;pair: For how mi&s;erable is he whom God hath left to the boiling Sea of his own Horrors, and thrown him out no Anchor of Hope?</P>
<P>However this Sentence &s;eem rigorous, yet when we con&s;ider the ponderous Arguments it u&s;es, it may rather amaze us, than provoke our Cen&s;ure: For Fir&s;t, it is very irreconcileable with the Glory of God, that Men who have had the knowledge of God, and been called upon all their Lives to give
<PB N="5" REF="108"> up them&s;elves to him, &s;hould be accepted, when they pour out to him the Lees and Dregs of Life, in&s;tead of the generous Spirits of it. That he that hath had in his Flock a Male, &s;hould vow, and Sa|crifice to the Lord a corrupt Thing, and yet e&s;cape the Cur&s;e of the Deceiver. The Expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture are innumerable in which God Di&s;avows &s;uch Pro&s;titutions of his Grace, (as is hereafter to be urged) but &s;eals &s;uch, e're they are aware, un|der Hardne&s;s of Heart, and a Reprobate Sen&s;e, to De&s;truction.</P>
<P N="2">2. It appears impo&s;&s;ible, there &s;hould be a di&s;|charge of the Duties of Repentance, when Men are a Dying; that they &s;hould draw within the hollow of that little Span, that is al&s;o otherwi&s;e incumbred, the va&s;tne&s;s of that Action, that is nece&s;&s;ary to take off the Brawn of a long Impenitency.</P>
<P>That a Man &s;hould live the life of Holine&s;s that is ju&s;t a Dying; that the Tree that hath been al|ways barren, &s;hould bring forth good Fruit, now it is a hewing down: The&s;e things are very con|tradictious; how can Repentance plant it &s;elf in the Soul, and &s;ettle gracious habits there in &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace? Or in an in&s;tant by Mortification root out tho&s;e Lu&s;ts, and &s;inful Affections, that have been many years eating into the Heart? Repentance mu&s;t have a time for Fruits, and tho&s;e Fruits for Ripening and Concoction, which a Death-Bed will not afford: So that it cannot be <HI>that Repentance of the Go&s;pel,</HI> but at the be&s;t, only &s;ome fir&s;t &s;trokes of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. There mu&s;t be a living to God before a Man dyes to God. It is the Supream Law, every one mu&s;t <HI>glorifie him here on Earth, and fini&s;h the work he hath given them to do in the World. They mu&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="109"> work the works of him that &s;ent them while it is day, before the night cometh, in which no Man can work.</HI> After this Men are received into the glory of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. In Repentance, we mu&s;t be in the &s;ame Cir|cum&s;tances of Temptation we were in, in the time of Sinning. But it will be hard to find in what the &s;tate of a Dying Man differs from that of him, that is already dead, as to this bu&s;ine&s;s of Repentance; but that he may as well be allowed to Repent, that is entred into Eternity, as he that &s;tands on the very brink of it.</P>
<P>This Cen&s;ure cannot be injurious to Men living, and in their full Opportunity; &s;uppo&s;e in Specula|tion, it &s;tretches Principles of great weight and truth too far, yet it recompen&s;es for it &s;elf by the whole&s;omne&s;s of it to practice; for who can &s;uffer by being nece&s;&s;itated to an early Repentance, &s;o much his Duty, &s;o much his Safety?</P>
<P>Further it is mo&s;t Prophetick, mo&s;t undoubtedly true of mo&s;t Mens late Repentance; That it is too &s;udden, too Mu&s;hrom a Birth to have any worthi|ne&s;s in it. This Repentance almo&s;t univer&s;ally wi|thers afore it grows up, and proves an Abortion; whether it comes to the tryal of a longer Life, where|in it vani&s;hes as a Cloud, and former Impiety re|turns; or whether it pa&s;s immediately into Eter|nity, where it &s;inks down into Mi&s;ery; for attempt|ing the Regions of Life, and wanting the Purity that ri&s;es thither, it is beaten back with all its Preten|&s;ions, as a Foggy Exhalation, that would climb to Heaven, but is forced down, and made to re&s;t be|low; &s;o that for the Univer&s;ality of <HI>Death-Bed Re|pentances</HI> this Judgment is truly calculated.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="109">
<P>If it &s;hould &s;eem too Cruel to the dying Condi|tion, to &s;mother Men alive with the &s;econd Death, (as <HI>Hazael</HI> &s;pread upon the dying King a thick Cloath dipped in Water) to &s;tifle and benum at once all motions towards God, let us con&s;ider what advice it offers again&s;t the Stupidities of De&s;pair.</P>
<P>When we are fallen into &s;o unhappy a Condition, that the whole weight of Eternity depends upon a very little Moment; it per&s;wades Men would do all they can in return to God, though that all mu&s;t be tru&s;ted with the Prerogative of Mercy; for that Mercy which is &s;tated in the Promi&s;es of the Go&s;|pel, and is in ordinary, cannot help them in the great point of Salvation, however it may alleviate their Condemnation, and le&s;&s;en their Torment.</P>
<P>I mad add, if that which appears a Me&s;&s;enger of Death &s;hould have &s;ecret reprieve in its In&s;tructi|ons, and what &s;eems a Death-bed, prove only a Di&s;|cipline: It may be a happy beginning of a true Re|pentance to him, who lives, after his being near the Grave, to perfect it, according to that of <HI>Job,</HI> 33. <HI>ver.</HI> 22, 23.</P>
<P>Thus this Opinion doth not cut off the Action of its de&s;perate Per&s;on; and if by that Action, he pa&s;s <HI>the needles Eye,</HI> and get through the <HI>&s;trait Gate</HI> of Repentance and Regeneration, it will be able to give him no Re&s;i&s;tance: For tho&s;e to whom the <HI>two-leav'd Gates</HI> of Faith and Repentance open, this Air of Di&s;cour&s;e cannot bar, that they &s;hould not enter into life.</P>
<P>But on the other &s;ide, they that are confident, and make them&s;elves &s;ure of Repentance and Mer|cy; cannot when they meet the &s;olid Ob&s;tacles of things, force their way by the Breath of their Mouth;
<PB N="8" REF="110"> but they and their intended Repentance are together locked up in the clo&s;ene&s;s and compactedne&s;s of tho&s;e Decrees; Fir&s;t; They cannot Repent, Then they cannot be Saved.</P>
<P>To conclude; let &s;uch a Deci&s;ion of this Ca&s;e be never &s;o au&s;tere, it is a thou&s;and times more Ju&s;t than the delay of our return to God in the Contem|plation of doing it at the la&s;t can be; and the Rea|&s;ons upon which it is planted, are &s;uch, that though they may not reach the height de&s;igned, yet do they exclude thou&s;ands from Eternal Happine&s;s; and although they may not make good the Comple|ment of the Cen&s;ure, yet are they of &s;o awful a regard, and &s;o worthy of all Ob&s;ervation, that they are mo&s;t vehemently to be pre&s;&s;ed to the main &s;cope; that Men would by no means tru&s;t to this Extreme Re|pentance, to which purpo&s;e I &s;hall hereafter take further advantage of them.</P>
<P>But let us come to that tenderer apprehen&s;ion of the generality of Divines, with which I will con|cur, that all things of Opinion and Di&s;pute may be taken away in &s;o great a Point. Let it then be allowed, that a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> is no im|po&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in regard of infinite Mercy, that cannot be limited, but by it &s;elf: Now long Impenitency, though it be often doomed irrevocably by God in particular Generations of Men, or Per&s;ons; yet is not that Sin, that <HI>&s;hall never be forgiven.</HI> Nor is it upon that account, that the Scripture &s;aith of &s;ome; <HI>It is impo&s;&s;ible to renew them to Repentance.</HI> So that though there be many Examples of &s;uch Im|penitency, that have proved in the Event unpardon|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, yet not from the preci&s;e Nature of the thing
<PB N="9" REF="110"> it &s;elf: We may rather believe, that as the unmea|&s;urable Being of God hath delighted it &s;elf in &s;o ma|ny varieties and gradations of the Creatures down from Angels to the darke&s;t foot-&s;teps of him&s;elf in the World; &s;o the un&s;earchable Riches of his Grace are made known in all kinds of Pardons. As there|fore it hath cho&s;en &s;ome of the wor&s;t of Sinners for the &s;orts of their Sins, chiefe&s;t of Sinners, and brought them home; &s;o &s;ome that have made the utmo&s;t adventure of continuance in Sin, that in the&s;e manifold Gla&s;&s;es it might be &s;een, <HI>Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded much more.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Though the time of this Repentance be &s;hort and narrow, and the Duties of Repentance exceed|ing long and broad; yet where there are found the true &s;ignatures of Repentance unfeigned, God be|holds the Fruit in the Seed and Root, he knows the Perfection of his own Creation, though Infant, or we may conceive &s;uch <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> in Repentance, Repentance born out of due time, as <HI>Paul</HI> was in the Apo&s;tle&s;hip, &s;uddenly accompli&s;hed, though they had not the regular time of forming, like <HI>a Nation brought forth in a day.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Cyprian</HI> de coena Do|mini.</NOTE>

<P N="3">3. Although there be according to the general Rule, a nece&s;&s;ity of living to God here in the World; yet God may di&s;pen&s;e with the Continuation, or
<PB N="10" REF="111"> drawing out of the Action of it in the&s;e late Peni|tents, as we ea&s;ily allow in the ca&s;e of Infants, or Men dying within &s;hort &s;pace after a Repentance begun upon &s;ad Con&s;ideration, and not in the Exigency of a Sickne&s;s.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it is not at all &s;uppo&s;ed, that God di&s;pen&s;es with the &s;incere Preparations and Re&s;olvedne&s;s of the Mind to that Action; but that they mu&s;t be mo&s;t true, &s;ound and unfeigned, and the very Action it &s;elf, according to the time, high, full and mo&s;t &s;ignificant; and as extraordinary as the Repentance it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P N="2">2. <HI>Head.</HI> I come now to the &s;econd Propo&s;al, which is to make inquiry, &s;eeing the Ca&s;e is thus, as it every way appears to be, How the name or notion of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> as &s;uch an univer&s;al Refuge, came up in the World; for it is a new Repentance, (<HI>much like tho&s;e new-come-up
<PB N="16" REF="114"> Gods Mo&s;es</HI> &s;peaks of, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32.17.) that Chri&s;tianity and the Go&s;pel know not. The Scrip|tures that treat mo&s;t profe&s;&s;edly of Repentance, al|ways in&s;i&s;t upon it as a reformed cour&s;e of Life, to be undertaken even now, while the Propo&s;als of Grace and Reconciliation are made to us; and only by very &s;ilent Intimations, the track of which is hard|ly di&s;cerned, leave it po&s;&s;ible, that God &s;hould by miracle &s;ave &s;ome very few out of the Fire, and pull them as Brands out of the Burning, by giving them Repentance at the la&s;t. Whereas this is now become the only Repentance in u&s;e, and hath devoured the other; as if to pre&s;s Men upon it were to torment them before their time, and to le&s;&s;en the Validity of this were to take away the Mercy of God, and deny the Grace that is &s;o free and univer&s;al. Let us &s;earch therefore how this &s;ort of Repentance hath come into &s;uch Repute. And if we ob&s;erve, we &s;hall find it fir&s;t ri&s;ing from the intimate Sen&s;e the Con&s;cience hath of the nece&s;&s;ity of Repentance; For were it not &s;o clear and evident a Duty, <HI>a Death-Bed Repen|tance</HI> had never been heard of; mo&s;t would choo&s;e to go out of the World as they have lived in it, not &s;uffering any degree of the trouble of Con&s;cience, or vexing them&s;elves with Reflections upon an unholy and ill-&s;pent Life. As Men have cho&s;e to live freely and uninterruptedly in forgetfulne&s;s of God, and an Eternal Condition <HI>days without number,</HI> Jer. 2.32. &s;o would they choo&s;e to die, were there not a Law within, that however it hath lain covered with the Du&s;t of Sen&s;uality, yet is now re&s;tored to its Autho|rity, and urges the Soul with the Terror of Puni&s;h|ment for &s;o long Di&s;obedience.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="114">
<P>And &s;econdly, this nece&s;&s;ity of Repentance, though &s;ecretly under&s;tood, yet was not &s;ufficiently con&s;i|dered in the time of Health, for had it been equally regarded, it had not been now to begin. He that had rightly mea&s;ured it, would not for a thou&s;and Worlds &s;o have adjourned it.</P>
<P>The&s;e two things then meeting &s;o oft together, <HI>viz.</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity of Repentance; and the neglect of it all along our Life: the nece&s;&s;ity it &s;hould be performed &s;ome time, ere Men go out of the World; and the neglect of it in the freer Opportunities of Life; The&s;e, I &s;ay, bring forth ha&s;ty motions of it at la&s;t: For it lo&s;ing nothing of its nece&s;&s;ity by its delay, it mu&s;t be done, as well as it may be at that time; even as the la&s;t Moments, wherein Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of great Con&s;equence are to be di&s;patched, pre&s;s for Expedition the more earne&s;tly, becau&s;e they mu&s;t be done then or never, though it often falls out, the time is &s;o far pa&s;t, they &s;uffer not only much di&s;ad|vantage, but even defeat by the delay.</P>
<P>The Notion of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> then we may perceive ri&s;ing from the great Indi&s;po&s;ition to Repent, while the Plea&s;ures of Sin are in their Sea|&s;on, and flouri&s;h, and Men in Health and Strength to enjoy them; and from the nece&s;&s;ities of Repentance falling upon them at the la&s;t, and wringing from them &s;ometimes very high Acknowledgments of God and an Eternal Condition, pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions of the folly, evil and vanity of former Life, de&s;ires of Mercy, Profe&s;&s;ions of &s;trong Re&s;olvedne&s;s to &s;erve God, and if they had many Lives to give God, they would give them all. All which being &s;o unu&s;ual to hear formerly out of &s;uch Mouths, and coming from Dying Men, for who&s;e Sayings we have a na|tural
<PB N="18" REF="115"> regard, Charity towards them, and willingne&s;s to hope well of them, gives the&s;e Semblances, the Reputation of Repentance. To which may be ad|ded, That tho&s;e who are Guides and Seers in Reli|gion too often, <HI>errante Clave,</HI> by too Liberal an Ab|&s;olution open the Kingdom of Heaven to &s;uch, and taking the In&s;truments of a fooli&s;h Shepherd to them&s;elves, heal the hurt of their Souls &s;lightly; &s;o that their Repentance is &s;aincted here, and though it mi&s;carry in the other World, yet the mi&s;carriage is hid al&s;o in that other World.</P>
<P>From all this hath ari&s;en a down-right Opinion of this kind of Repentance, as the only <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> the Prudent Expedient, that compounds two &s;o dif|ferent Intere&s;ts, fir&s;t that of a worldly Conver&s;ation, to which it gives no hinderance; then that of Eter|nal Life in appearance, becau&s;e it a&s;&s;umes the Pro|mi&s;es of Mercy to it &s;elf, e&s;pecially tho&s;e gracious A&s;&s;urances in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18. <HI>Chap.</HI> 33. it reckons as made on purpo&s;e for it. All which argues a very vile Sen&s;e both of the Ju&s;tice and Mercy of God; of his Ju&s;tice as if it had no authority, of his Mercy as if it had no &s;en&s;e of Honour.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly it is grown into a general Expectation, rhat however ill and carele&s;ly of God Men have lived here, yet they &s;hould go out of the World with good words of him and Religious Profe&s;&s;ions, as an In|balm to their Memory and a Dirge to their Souls in|to the Happine&s;s of an Everla&s;ting Condition.</P>

<P>Now this account I have given of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> obtaining among us, is too comprehen|&s;ive; yet I mu&s;t acknowledge, that there are many who&s;e Judgments are more enlightned, and the Senti|ments of their Con&s;ciences quicker than to be &s;atisfi|ed at &s;o ea&s;ie a rate, who yet fall into the common unhappine&s;s of not having repented, till they come to die: I will therefore enquire further, why many who are able to feel before-hand the nece&s;&s;ities of a &s;peedy Repentance, and al&s;o to draw their Death &s;o near them, as to die daily in the &s;en&s;e of Death; and thereby further perceive tho&s;e Nece&s;&s;ities, do not yet Repent daily, but betray them&s;elves to an <HI>Even|ing or Twilight Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>The Re&s;olution of this lies not only in the immo|derate love of Sin and its Plea&s;ures, and the too low apprehen&s;ion of God and Eternal Things, (though the&s;e are always pre&s;ent in the ca&s;e) but chiefly it lies in the great Confidence &s;uch Men have in the pre|&s;ent time, not &s;en&s;ible of the continual wa&s;te of it; Under the favour of which they <HI>put away the evil day far from them, and &s;tretch them&s;elves</HI> upon this moment, <HI>Amos</HI> 6.3. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they may take their full Ea&s;e and Satisfaction: In the mean while &s;tifling the Thoughts of Dying and Judgment.

<PB N="23" REF="117"> yet according to the former &s;tate given I do not deny, but that &s;ome very rare Example there may be, giving a better Sen&s;e to this &s;ort of Repen|tance; Examples of the Grace of God, acting in a way of Prerogative, as hath been &s;aid, and working effectually the truth of Repentance in &s;ome; upon whom he lays the hand of his Salvation and Re&s;cue, while they &s;tand upon the very la&s;t minutes of the Sea&s;on of Grace, and are ju&s;t dropping down into Hell; and guides them to take their Late&s;t &s;teps in the ways of Life, wherein they had hitherto been &s;trangers; upon whom a great Miracle is wrought, that they &s;hould in their almo&s;t perfected motion to endle&s;s Ruin be &s;topt, and when they had ju&s;t fini&s;h|ed their Cour&s;e thither, they &s;hould yet be tran&s;|planted into the way Everla&s;ting.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the Third Head. To examine the mo&s;t hopeful appearances of this kind of Repen|tance, and to &s;hew there are plain Cau&s;es of them, much below the nature of true Repentance.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t in the general: It is no wonderful thing to find Men in a Paroxy&s;m, in a high Pa&s;&s;ion of &s;eeking after God, when they are a Dying. It is in|deed more &s;trange to find any &s;o &s;otted, &s;o &s;ear'd, <HI>That their &s;pirits &s;eem only to go downward: They are Bea&s;ts while they live, and as &s;uch they go down to the dead,</HI> Eccle&s;. 3.18, <HI>&amp;c. There are no bands in their Death,</HI> P&s;al. 73.4. <HI>They go down in a Mo|ment,</HI> Job 21.13. There is not a Moment between the fir&s;t and &s;econd Death of the Soul, not a Moment of Life between, not &s;o much as of the Life of na|tural Con&s;cience. <HI>They are twice dead,</HI> Jude 12. dead in the common Corruption of Nature wherein they are born. Dead in the lo&s;s of Natural Principles:
<PB N="24" REF="118"> <HI>pulled up by the roots,</HI> there's nothing to quicken or move in them. This is amazing Stupor: <HI>They die like a &s;tone,</HI> Exod. 15.5. 1 Sam. 25.37. they plunge down with the whole weight and force of Impenitency.</P>
<P>This way of Dying hath certainly greater Puni&s;h|ment, and heavier Condemnation; and though it &s;eem more choo&s;eable than a fruitle&s;s Repentance, yet doubtle&s;s Eternity makes a difference, though not &s;uch an one, as &s;hould give any one Confidence to imbarque into it in a <HI>Coffin-Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>But whether it be rather to be cho&s;en or not, this is pa&s;t que&s;tion; It is unavoidable to &s;ome; whether they will or no they are &s;urprized with Thoughts, what will become of them for ever, and few Men but have thoughts this way at &s;uch a time above ordinary.</P>
<P>But I intend to &s;peak of the faire&s;t and be&s;t &s;pread Repentance that is found upon a Death-bed. That which gives the livelie&s;t Hopes of it &s;elf, that it is true and &s;incere; not &s;uch an one that to a &s;erious Ob|&s;erver betrays it &s;elf; not either that forced compo|&s;ure, to the Expectation of the World, which looks for a &s;olemn Profe&s;&s;ion of God from every one that dies; nor an ignorant and formal Repentance; but a Repentance that hath much of Vigor, and inward Affection, and is driven on by great knowledge and light; that is accompanied with much Sorrow, and very con&s;iderate Apprehen&s;ions of Eternal Things: And if &s;uch an one be &s;o que&s;tionable, what can be|come of others?</P>
<P>There is no rea&s;on any Repentance &s;hould be the better e&s;teemed becau&s;e Men are Dying, but much the le&s;s. Now while Men are living a thou&s;and of the&s;e &s;eeming Changes for the better, are evidently
<PB N="25" REF="118" MS="y"> confuted without more ado, by after returns to Wickedne&s;s; and they that have to do with &s;uch &s;hews of Reformation, have no regard of them, nor of the Per&s;ons for them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apud illum Cordis Inter|pretem Ars non admittitur ad &s;alutem. <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> Serm. <HI>120.</HI></NOTE> Now God, who is the exact Searcher of Hearts, can much le&s;s be impo&s;ed upon by the faire&s;t appearances; nor can Men wi&s;e according to the Rules of Scripture be ea&s;ily well per&s;waded of them, and when they are be&s;t per&s;waded, there mu&s;t needs be a very trembling Con&s;ideration of &s;o great a hazard.</P>
<P>But to come more particularly to what I have pro|po&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;hew that Repentance is a Height, to which the&s;e general Motives of this late Repen|tance can never mount the Soul. In which I will begin with the De&s;criptions of true Repentance, in that wherein it is mo&s;t difficult (not to &s;ay impo&s;&s;i|ble) to ri&s;e to it upon a Dying Bed.</P>
<P>Repentance in all the parts of it, is the fulle&s;t, cleare&s;t act of the Soul and Judgment, wherein it is mo&s;t perfectly it &s;elf. Remove a Man never &s;o far from all kind of Fears, from the Appearances of Death, if he were to live Ages, he would be of the &s;ame Sen&s;e.

For however this may be introduced by very trouble&s;om and tumultu|ous Motions, yet it is it &s;elf the ea&s;ie &s;itting down of the Soul with
<PB N="26" REF="119"> abundant Plea&s;ure and Satisfaction in the abhorrence of Sin, and love of Holine&s;s, in the di&s;like of Vani|ty and Sen&s;uality, in the Approbation of heavenly Purity of Heart and Life. It is not a Trance where|in Sin lies dead, and a Man is in a Rapture of Good|ne&s;s for a time, but a mo&s;t &s;etled State. <HI>Godly &s;or|row, that worketh Repentance, worketh Careful|ne&s;s, Fear, Revenge, De&s;ire,</HI> 2 Cor. 7.11. <HI>and by</HI> the&s;e accompli&s;heth <HI>a Repentance to Salvation,</HI> that hath no after-pain or trouble, no <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">. Ver&s;. 10. The&s;e Affections are Preparations. Repentance en|ters as a Soul into the&s;e, which is a &s;till, &s;olid, clear Act of Rea&s;on renewed, and a Mind which gives an uniform Vote at all times. A Change that is never changed back again, no more than things can put off them&s;elves, or evil it &s;elf become good. It is therefore upon fulle&s;t Deliberation to choo&s;e with <HI>Jo&s;huah, I and my hou&s;e,</HI> tho&s;e whom <HI>I</HI> can govern, <HI>will &s;erve the Lord,</HI> Jo&s;h. 24.15. It is <HI>Engaging the Heart to approach to God, the joining our &s;elves to him by an everla&s;ting Covenant, never to be forgot|ten,</HI> Jer. 30.21. and 50.5. <HI>The cleaving to him with full purpo&s;e of Heart,</HI> Acts 11.23. When all forerunning Affections are laid and quiet, or worn out, this Judgment &s;till remains, and rai&s;eth other Affections like it &s;elf, that ever remain with it; into which the Spirits of the former are extracted, and wherein they exerci&s;e all the true power they had. But now on a Death-bed there is often a great Commotion rai&s;ed, a loud blu&s;tre of Pa&s;&s;ion never arriving at this point, at this Settlement: But if a Man &s;hould live after, it would go off, as Clouds and Storms, that when they have &s;pent them&s;elves, va|ni&s;h and lie down: And when a Man dies, it is to
<PB N="27" REF="119"> be fear'd, that as they were rai&s;ed by approach to the unappea&s;able Tempe&s;ts of Darkne&s;s, &s;o they are hurried with their Violence.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is carefully to be ob&s;erved, that there is in true Repentance a due Proportion betwixt the con|trite Indignation of the Soul again&s;t pa&s;t Sin, and the love and zeal it hath for Holine&s;s: whereas in <HI>Death-bed Repentances,</HI> it is oftene&s;t found, that there is either a terrifying Pre&s;ence only of former Sins, ap|pearing to the affrighted Con&s;cience, without a more hopeful Indication of the Soul truly compo&s;ed to Righteou&s;ne&s;s: or el&s;e &s;ome high flying Re&s;olutions of better Life afterward, offered, as a kind of Bribe to the Patience and Mercy of God, in hopes of pre|&s;ent Deliverance, or at be&s;t, as a Ran&s;om from Hell and Eternal Damnation; but without a deep &s;en&s;e of the guilt and evil of pa&s;t Sins, or the ju&s;t appre|hen&s;ion of that continually running i&s;&s;ue of Corrup|tion, that is &s;till defiling anew: Either of the&s;e is a main Error, and pernicious; For if on the one &s;ide the Heart in a Rage be forced to ca&s;t out &s;ome Sins for the turbulency of them, if it be not imme|diately filled with better Gue&s;ts, <HI>Seven other Spirits are ready to enter, and make the la&s;t &s;tate of that Man wor&s;e than the fir&s;t,</HI> Mat. 12.43. For Repen|tance is no void &s;pace, no &s;ilent, or unactive &s;tate, but when it hath di&s;lodged Lu&s;ts, furni&s;hes and fills the Soul with the be&s;t things, and carries the vigor of a Man's Action to the be&s;t effect; <HI>When by re|pentance a Man cea&s;es to do evil, he learns to do Well,</HI> I&s;ai. 1.16, 17. <HI>And brings forth fruits meet for repentance, and amendment of life,</HI> Mat. 3.8.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide, he that &s;eems to make a ha&s;ty motion to Holine&s;s without due &s;en&s;e of Sin, fir&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="120"> thinks to overrule the method God hath &s;et, who requires Humiliation, godly Sorrow, Anger, Revenge, Fear, as preparing to Repentance: And further, he conceits a freedom to him&s;elf, when he is fetter'd and bound; without a power given him from God, he offers to ca&s;t out <HI>Devils with ea&s;e, that cannot be ca&s;t out, but by fa&s;ting and prayer,</HI> Mark 9.29. (that is) &s;evere cour&s;es of Self-aba&s;ement, and low|lie&s;t dependences together with earne&s;te&s;t Applica|tion to the Grace of God. The&s;e unclean Spirits therefore, that di&s;&s;emble a retreat, return immediately, and make a Prey of the deluded Soul, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.14, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Although Heaven and Hell, Happine&s;s and Mi|&s;ery, take up the thoughts of a true Penitent, yet not &s;eparated from God and Chri&s;t, but as it were compounded into the Sen&s;e of God angry, and the de&s;ire of Attonement with him in <HI>Je&s;us Christ.</HI> Hap|pine&s;s and Mi&s;ery con&s;idered apart are not the ob|ject of the gracious Soul: But God and Chri&s;t con|&s;idered apart are an infinitely &s;ufficient Rea&s;on of Repentance. The clear love of God upwards the Soul, as a Father in Chri&s;t without Reflections upon Happine&s;s, is, though not the &s;ingle, yet the para|mount Con&s;ideration in Repentance unfeigned. But Men a Dying are generally &s;o over-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the Terrors of an Eternal Suffering, and meer de&s;ires of Freedom from pain; and of well-being, and &s;o in ha&s;te, that they generally mi&s;s the&s;e higher Con&s;i|derations, which being further off, not only from corrupt Nature, but even from natural Con&s;cience, are not commonly e&s;pied, but therefore argue great|er Sincerity, and truth of Heart.</P>
<P N="4">4. The true&s;t Repentance lies in the bo&s;om of Faith, the apprehen&s;ions of the Love and Goodne&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="120"> of God in Chri&s;t melt the Soul, and give it mo&s;t perfect Separation from Sin, the mo&s;t effectual Pu|rification of the Heart; all which expre&s;s the height of Repentance. Upon the &s;oft Fire of the pardoning Goodne&s;s of God, the Soul mo&s;t kindly di&s;tils into repentant Tears. Here flows that Spirit of Grace, and ingenuous Goodne&s;s, which bringeth forth the cleare&s;t and holie&s;t Affection towards God.</P>
<P>But at the time we are now &s;peaking of; It is very &s;eldom, that either Horror or Pre&s;umption do not &s;wallow all: Pre&s;umption, where there is little Sen&s;e or Judgment of the Ca&s;e; Horror, where the Judg|ment is clearer and the Sen&s;e quicker; for evey thing di&s;po&s;es now rather to Fear, <HI>and to the Spirit of Bon|dage,</HI> Rom. 8.15. and a Man naturally does all he does under a &s;ervile dread of God, and his Eternal Ju&s;tice, And though there may be much mention of Chri&s;t, and de&s;ire of Mercy through him; yet it is but as a Malefactor convicted, be&s;eeches the Mercy of the Judge, no otherwi&s;e than as of a Judge: So &s;uch call out for the Mercy of God to par|don them, but &s;till as a Judge, not with the <HI>Spi|rit of the Son &s;ent into the Heart, the Spirit of Adoption crying Abba, Father.</HI> Nor <HI>with that love that ca&s;teth out unworthy Fear,</HI> Gal. 4.6. And in|deed how can it be otherwi&s;e, there having been <HI>no acquaintance with God in the way,</HI> Job 22.21. but a long Enmity; and the time now too &s;trait for a free and full Con&s;ideration of the riches of Grace, &s;uch as may &s;till an awakened Con&s;cience: Fear pre&s;&s;es in every way, and &s;huts out Faith. What can now redeem the Soul from this helli&s;h Terror, but a light from Heaven immediately darting into it, a Grace above that Grace, that ordinarily &s;aves Men? For a
<PB N="30" REF="121"> well &s;etled Tru&s;t and Confidence in Mercy according to the general Rule, is not, but after &s;ome &s;ad de|bates, and experimental Con&s;ultations, that have pa&s;&s;ed between the &s;en&s;e of Sin, and the affiancing Acts of the Soul upon Chri&s;t. This Repentance then is in great danger of mi&s;&s;ing the Spirit of the Go&s;pel, and falling into the Rank of tho&s;e Repen|tances of <HI>Cain, E&s;au, Judas.</HI></P>
<P>This I have endeavoured to &s;hew, that though we &s;uppo&s;e a Dying Man to &s;pread his Soul and Thoughts every way, and to all the parts of Repentance; yet it is extremely to be &s;u&s;pected, there will want the true and right quality of them; in regard of the ve|ry di&s;advantageous Circum&s;tances, wherein &s;uch an one is found; and the great unfitne&s;s of the Soul at that time, to begin to do anything worthy, to which it hath not been before inured; or if it did begin, it would be much more unlikely <HI>to bring forth fruit</HI> (as our Saviour &s;peaks) <HI>to perfection,</HI> Luke 8.14.</P>
<P>I add nothing of the Exerci&s;es of a full and well grown Repentance, whereby it is daily e&s;pying the ri&s;ings of Sin, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing them, and filling up the Defects of Holine&s;s and Obedience; becau&s;e they are not to be thought po&s;&s;ible in the point I am now &s;peaking of, and I have already given a Re&s;olution in that Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;et my &s;elf to find out the low Cau&s;es, that are alway to be &s;u&s;pected to have the great In|fluence upon &s;uch a <HI>Latter-end Penitency.</HI></P>
<P>In general therefore, we mu&s;t take notice, that there are &s;everal vapors of mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, ri&s;ing upon the Soul, when we are a Dying, that do &s;o di&s;gui&s;e it to it &s;elf, and disfigure the true face of it, that from thence ari&s;e dangerous Mi&s;takes concern|ing a Mans Condition towards God.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="121">
<P>We &s;ee into how many &s;hapes upon ordinary Oc|currences we change, and how ea&s;ily we exchange them for quite different, without any good Cau&s;e; what continual Ebbs and Flows there are of the Hu|mours, and how do the&s;e ca&s;t the Ballance of the Superiour Soul? One Man is every hour &s;ome &s;everal &s;orts of Men.</P>
<P>How much more do great Accidents, and removes out of one Condition into another, alter us? Which yet are but the &s;udden and ju&s;t now &s;tate of our Minds upon &s;uch Alterations, which not continuing we return to our former Figure, <HI>&V;n&s;table and weak as water,</HI> Gen. 49.3. we take the form of every Ve&s;&s;el we are put into. Who knows then whether his Dying Repentance be any more than the Mould, not of his Mind, but of his Dying Condition approaching him big, with &s;o great a Change? We know many things befal us in our Lives, which put a greater &s;en&s;e of Religion upon us, than we find at other times; and yet how variable are we? <HI>our goodne&s;s at &s;uch times is as the Morning Dew, and as the early Dew it goeth away,</HI> Ho&s;e. 6.4. How often are we from the occa&s;ions of Mercies, Afflictions, Fears, Hopes, good Di&s;cour&s;es, carried into high Apprehen|&s;ions of God? And we lo&s;e them again we know not how: Now out of doubt a Dying Condition of any thing we meet with in the World is mo&s;t apt to move us upon God, and a Sen&s;e of him. But can we think, Tho&s;e fleeting Shoots of the Soul, that have no certainty, are accepted for Repentance?</P>
<P>How &s;trangely doth Melancholly, and Oppre&s;&s;ions of that transform Men? which when it falls upon the Motions of Con&s;cience, gives us &s;trong Imagina|tions of Eternal Things; which yet being nothing
<PB N="32" REF="122"> but the ca&s;t of that Melancholly upon the Thoughts; when that is removed, they are quite of another hue.</P>
<P>It is evident the Mind &s;ees much through the Bo|dy, and the Repre&s;entations are coloured by its Temper. As the Eye &s;ees through yellow or green Gla&s;s, differently from the things them&s;elves: So the Serenity or Cloudine&s;s of the Humours makes a different Reflection of things upon the Mind, and the liveline&s;s or heavine&s;s of the Spirits incline us to very varying Apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>Now what time is more like to be &s;o incumber'd with the&s;e Clouds and Vapours than a Dying Hour? When every thing is ready to contribute them, and nothing to &s;catter them? If then Natural Con&s;cience, and implanted Sen&s;e of God together with the No|tions given us from Scripture pa&s;s through the&s;e, they become very impre&s;&s;ive, and affecting for the time; and yet he much mi&s;takes Repentance, who thinks it no more, than a fit of Religious Melancholly.</P>
<P>But let us enquire after &s;ome more &s;etled, and con&s;tant Cau&s;es of the&s;e Penitential Motions near Death, and we &s;hall find many very likely to be &s;o, that are not yet worthy of true Repentance, and therefore what &s;prings from them, is not accepted before God.</P>
<P N="1">1. When Men find all their Being in the World at an end, and feel them&s;elves falling, they know not whither; It is no &s;trange thing they &s;hould catch at God, and that they may take hold of him, at Ho|line&s;s al&s;o; Seeing ingraffed Principles together with general Di&s;cour&s;e teach every one, how dear Holine&s;s is to God.</P>
<P>If God and Goodne&s;s were no more than Imagina|ry things: It would be no wonder, if they who are
<PB N="33" REF="122"> to&s;&s;ed off the World, and thrown over-board from it, &s;hould &s;natch at them; if there were no more in the Ca&s;e than this, that every one hath heard &s;o much &s;peech, and talk of them among Men. For to him that hath nothing in reality, even a Shadow, a Phan|cy are valuable. Men that are dropping through the Air, or &s;inking under Water, without Con&s;ulta|tion offer at every thing they meet with.</P>
<P>In great Extremities &s;hort of Death, they that are bereft of all worldly A&s;&s;i&s;tance, fly to the Divine Succours, though as <HI>Jonah</HI>'s Marriners they pray to an Idol in&s;tead of the true God, and their Devoti|on is no better than Super&s;tition, which is but a Phancy in Religion. What &s;trange thing then is it, for nature to cry out for God, and Chri&s;t, for Par|don of Sin, to be delivered from Hell, and to have Heaven for an everla&s;ting Re&s;t, when all things el&s;e evidently fail as they do in Death; and when not only Phancy, and general Opinion, but mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial Rea&s;on inlightned by the Scripture provoke up a Man to it, even for Self-pre&s;ervation?</P>
<P>Yet this differs but little <HI>from howling upon our Beds for Corn, and Wine, and Oyl,</HI> Ho&s;. 7.14. for though the things differ much in their Nature, yet the E&s;teem Men have of them, and the de&s;ire they have after them is much upon the &s;ame ground; for the&s;e Spiritual things appear to that natural Sen&s;e of Self-pre&s;ervation, as nece&s;&s;ary in Death, as the other do in Life and Health.</P>
<P>But if the approaches of Death happen to be again drawn off, the value of Spiritual things removes with them, and the things of this World, with all the &s;en&s;ual and &s;inful Delights of it, return to their former price: which argues the ineffectualne&s;s of
<PB N="34" REF="123"> this cau&s;e of Repentance, and the Unacceptablene&s;s of the Repentance it &s;elf to God, that flows from it; God di&s;claims Men, that have never come to him before their Extremity, and come then only becau&s;e of it. <HI>In the time of their trouble they will &s;ay, Ari&s;e, and &s;ave us: But where are thy Gods that thou made&s;t? Let them ari&s;e if they can &s;ave thee,</HI> Jer. 2.27, 28. Thus to &s;uch Dying Men crying out to him, God &s;ays, Let your former Lu&s;ts and Plea|&s;ures now be your Happine&s;s. <HI>Fools and &s;corners,</HI> that would not be warned, <HI>call upon God in their calamity, and &s;eek him early, when the whirlwind of their de&s;tructions hurries them, but cannot make him hear, cannot find him,</HI> Prov. 1.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. Suppo&s;e the de&s;ires after God, and Eternal Happine&s;s, with all the Retinue of tho&s;e De&s;ires ri&s;e not, &s;o much, from the Nece&s;&s;ities of remove from this Life, and &s;en&s;ible Supports, but immediately from the &s;ight of Eternal things them&s;elves: yet will not this conclude the Repentance &s;incere. For we may ea&s;ily pitch upon &s;everal &s;o plain rea&s;ons of the&s;e quick Apprehen&s;ions of another World, that it is much more &s;trange, if any Man be not &s;truck with them; and they that are, are not in greater Exta&s;ies of the&s;e Con&s;iderations, than that mo&s;t die in &s;ome fair inclinable Temper towards them, and others are extraordinarily &s;urprized with them, yet without true Repentance.</P>
<P>For Fir&s;t, If it were no more, but the lei&s;ure, and unintere&s;tedne&s;s of the Mind in all worldly things, that Death brings: It is no wonder that the Action of it &s;hould immediately, and nece&s;&s;arily flow upon God; for it being always in action, and motion from its very Nature, and God having made it for him&s;elf;
<PB N="35" REF="123"> and the manner of its living here in the World being a &s;lavery willingly undertaken for the Service of the Body, and the Enjoyment of this pre&s;ent Life, in its being fallen from God: It is nothing &s;trange, that that Drudgery being now at an end, and the chains wherein it was held, ju&s;t a breaking, it &s;hould fall upon God, and Spiritual Objects, whither the &s;tream of it was prepared to run, and which are mo&s;t truly its own bu&s;ine&s;s. For the di&s;tance being &s;o wide, and irreconcilable between Man, and this Earth in Death; the very having nothing el&s;e to do mu&s;t car|ry him upon the Future State; &s;eeing his Soul is &s;uch a Being as cannot naturally lie &s;till, and that State is all, that it hath to work upon, and further than that, it is &s;o nearly allied to it.</P>
<P>Secondly, The very loo&s;ening and uncementing the Soul from the Body, wherein it dwelt, and wherein the Motions of it were re|&s;trained,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Multi enim quum remi&s;&s;i &amp; liberi &s;unt futura pro&s;pi|ciunt, ex quo intelligitur quales futuri &s;int quum &s;e plane corporis vinculis relax|averint. <HI>Cic.</HI> de Senectut.</NOTE> hath been thought very probably to give Men le&s;&s;er de|grees of tho&s;e Advantages near their Death, which naked and free Spirits not inclo&s;ed and pent up in Bodies have, whereby they have been able to make Conjectures of future things, and to &s;peak pro|phetically. The le&s;s the Soul is bound to work by the Body, the higher are its Operations. All ex|traordinary Motions of the Soul are a kind of Ravi&s;hment from Sen&s;e.

<PB N="36" REF="124"> to be thought, that when the Soul and Body are ready to cleave a&s;under, and the Spirit to be &s;epara|ted from Fle&s;h, that it &s;hould make an higher flight towards Eternal Things.</P>
<P>The nearer every thing is to its own Re&s;idence, the more vehement is its motion &s;aid to be thither. So there may very well be quick &s;allies of the Soul to|wards Eternity, before it enters into it, when it is &s;o near that everla&s;ting Receptacle of it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Thirdly, We may ob&s;erve in the Experience of all times, every appearance of the other World hath &s;trange effects of Fear, and affrightment upon Mens Minds: When any one is entring then into that whole World, it may well put him upon purifying him&s;elf, more than they that fall upon <HI>Leviathan,</HI> Job 41.25. When Men are ju&s;t upon that Region of Spirits, what appalements of Mind and &s;trong work|ing of Thoughts mu&s;t there needs be? Much more if the Soul have any &s;en&s;e of its approach to the in|finite Holine&s;s of God, at who&s;e rebuke the Pillars of Heaven tremble; who&s;e pre&s;ence a&s;toni&s;hes the purer Spirits of Angels, and beats down the Souls of good Men to the Du&s;t, as of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 12.21. I&s;ai. 6.5. Job 42.6. Dan. 10.8.</NOTE> <HI>Job, I&s;aiah, &amp;c.</HI> in his interviews with them. How much more of tho&s;e that have never thought of God, and now mu&s;t come near his Seat?</P>
<P>Nothing &s;o compo&s;es the Soul to this amazing change of Condition and Conver&s;e, as long continu|ed Treaties with God through Chri&s;t: when though Men change their place, they do not change their company:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Job 24.17. Job 38.15.</NOTE> Others, when this great <HI>light &s;trikes
<PB N="37" REF="124"> them, are in the very terrors of the &s;hadow of death, and &s;haken out of their place,</HI> out of all the Security, and quiet Sen&s;uality they lived in.</P>
<P>Let us now take the e&s;timate or avail of the&s;e things to true Repentance, and we &s;hall find, when the Soul lies thus uncovered to the things of Eternity, it hath natural Rea&s;ons for all, it may &s;eem to do like return to God, and &s;o that all argue nothing of the true Grace of God; but if a Man were again in his former State he would be the very &s;ame he was: For fir&s;t, as one thing &s;trikes upon another with a na|tural Effect, Light upon the Eye, Sound upon the Ear, &s;o Eternal Things upon the Immortal Spirit, when there is nothing between to intercept the &s;troke. Further,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 2.16.</NOTE> when <HI>the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life</HI> are as a Scene remo|ved, and a Play at an end; and in&s;tead of them another World drawing near, ju&s;t as Men defeated in all their attempts for Riches, and Honours, and beaten off from them to a private Life, call all the&s;e things Cheats; not out of true Rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they cannot reach them: on the other &s;ide they prai&s;e Retirement and a Cloy&s;ter, not that they like it, but becau&s;e they mu&s;t live &s;o, which begets &s;ome kind of Contentedne&s;s &s;o to live. Thus and no otherwi&s;e do many Dying Men call all this World Vanity, and profe&s;s an high E&s;teem for all things pertaining to that to come.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;e</HI> 3. There is yet a more pre&s;&s;ing Account of the mo&s;t notable motions that were ever found in any of their Repentances, <HI>viz.</HI> The awakenings of Con&s;cience u&s;ual at this time, becau&s;e of the Sen&s;e of a Judgment: while common Experience tells
<PB N="38" REF="125"> Men, <HI>It is appointed, to all Men once to die,</HI> Heb. 9.27. and &s;inking Nature gives notice, This is the time: Con&s;cience lifts up to the next thing. <HI>After that the Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Now no Man &s;ees Judgment, a Judgment Omni|&s;cient, Omnipre&s;ent, Eternal, without great &s;hakes of Soul, e&s;pecially that hath done nothing &s;eriou&s;ly <HI>to agree with the adver&s;ary in the way,</HI> Luk. 12.18. Con&s;cience then ri&s;ing up with the Awe of a Tribu|nal upon it, &s;tirs up all the Powers to fly from the Wrath that is to come, by de&s;ires of Pardon, and Re&s;olutions of Amendment. The very hearing of Judgment made &s;uch a one as <HI>Foe|lix tremble.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 24.25.</NOTE> When Judgment &s;eems to us, at the other end of Heaven, all is quiet; but when Death brings us to the very &s;eat of it, how loud may be the cries for Mercy? The bewailing the former evils of Life? Now Men pour out their Complaints for the want of God, the mi&s;improvement of former time: Now they make large offers of a &s;trict and &s;evere Mortifi|cation, and Devotion to Religion. Now they would give <HI>the thou&s;and Rams, the ten thou&s;and Rivers of Oyl, their fir&s;t born for their Tra&s;gre&s;&s;ion, the fruit of their Body for the &s;in of their Soul,</HI> Mic. 6.6, 7. And yet all but the Eye opened to &s;ee the flaming Sword of Ju&s;tice, that makes even a <HI>Balaam</HI> wi&s;h to die the death of the Righteous,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Num.</HI> 22.32. <HI>cap.</HI> 23.10.</NOTE> and to have a latter End, Sober, Ju&s;t, Religious.</P>
<P>The very Su&s;pition of a Judgment inclines Men thus far univer&s;ally almo&s;t, that hardly any choo&s;e to die in a Rant, in a Madne&s;s; but had rather by
<PB N="39" REF="125"> virtue, and Religion be con&s;igned over to another World; and have their Eyes clo&s;ed by Mercy, and Grace in Chri&s;t: They would &s;ee the Salvation of God, and &s;o depart in Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 1. But it may be objected: Seeing the&s;e granted to ri&s;e from true Conviction, and not to be Di&s;&s;imulation, or counterfeit Pretence, Why may not they have the worth of true Repentance?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. To an&s;wer this: Let me con&s;ider, pure Conviction, and enlightned Apprehen&s;ion, and the Affections begotten of them, are no Argument of true Goodne&s;s, where the Light hath not a benign, and free Operation upon the Judgment, an Allure|ment upon the Will, an Indearment upon the Affections, to turn them to a full Delight, and Sa|tisfaction in God and Holine&s;s, and to a di&s;like and abhorrence of Sin. For el&s;e, the Devils, <HI>who believe and tremble,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jam.</HI> 2.19.</NOTE> mu&s;t be thought Converts. For who have clearer &s;ight of things than they? <HI>Balaam,</HI> who&s;e Eyes were opened, and &s;poke &s;o great things of God, and his People, mu&s;t be concluded a good Man. <HI>E&s;au</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> who had &s;o &s;ad apprehen&s;ions of Sin,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Matth.</HI> 27.4. <HI>Heb.</HI> 12.7. <HI>Dan.</HI> 4.17. <HI>and</HI> 6.26. <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.20. <HI>Acts</HI> 24.25.</NOTE> and their lo&s;s by it, mu&s;t be affirmed to be Penitents. <HI>Nebucadnezar</HI>'s and <HI>Darius</HI> his acknowledgments of God mu&s;t be taken for true Grace. <HI>Herod</HI> his hearing <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> gladly. <HI>Felix</HI> his trem|bling at <HI>Paul</HI>'s Di&s;cour&s;e, may be thought Eviden|ces of true Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2. But Secondly it may be &s;uppo&s;ed, be|cau&s;e the&s;e very Convictions and Affections are not
<PB N="40" REF="126"> univer&s;al; but we &s;ee multitudes go out of the World without them, carrying little better than a decent and civil Re&s;pect to Religion, that therefore there is &s;omething of God, &s;omething Heroick in them, that have them.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 2. This indeed may be no other, than the wi&s;e and good Government of God over the World; whereby he takes care, there &s;hould be Te&s;timonies of him&s;elf, and the Goodne&s;s of his ways; that Athe|i&s;m, and Wickedne&s;s may not carry it, as if all were their own, as if there were an unexceptionable Con|currence on their &s;ide again&s;t God and Holine&s;s. For as he receives witne&s;s from the con&s;tant, gracious and religious Lives of good Men, &s;o he con&s;trains &s;ome of them, that have lived contrary to him all their lives, to give him glory at la&s;t, for the good of others, though without &s;aving benefit to them&s;elves. Which he may ju&s;tly do, and without any injury to them. Seeing all the Service every Creature can do to him, is infinitely due, he may make u&s;e of that which is his own, &s;o far as he plea&s;es. And becau&s;e <HI>what the word God puts in their mouths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Num.</HI> 23.5. <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.35.</NOTE> is not their own, not ari&s;ing out of the <HI>good trea&s;ure of their hearts</HI> (as appears in <HI>Balaam</HI>) therefore their everla&s;ting Condition is not determi|ned by it, but by their con&s;tant Cour&s;e of the for|mer Life, the true Image of their Hearts, as we &s;ee in the &s;ame <HI>Balaam,</HI> who after died by the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Num.</HI> 31.8.</NOTE> who&s;e greatne&s;s he had prophe&s;ied. Yet I will not deny, but they may have their reward in miti|gation of Puni&s;hment for any Service done to God.</P>
<P>If God did not interpo&s;e thus &s;ometimes, he might
<PB N="41" REF="126"> &s;eem wanting in &s;omething that concerned him, at lea&s;t as a gracious Ruler of the World. He therefore over-rules &s;ome, who have lived &s;o, as to make a con|&s;tant Argument again&s;t him, and a future State (&s;o far as Wickedne&s;s could do it) to retract the whole Cour&s;e of their Life, and give their Vote, for what they had &s;o long with&s;tood.</P>
<P>I will yet further add another Cau&s;e of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> that &s;ometimes falls out to have a mo&s;t powerful Influence, and yet the Repentance that &s;prings from it, is very un&s;afe to confide in.</P>
<P><HI>Cau&s;e</HI> 4. Dying Men are oft under the play and force of other Mens Rea&s;on and Religion. For it is a general, and nece&s;&s;ary Charity of Men affected to Religion them&s;elves, to offer the &s;en&s;e of it to others, in a time when they think it likely to be accept|ed, and &s;o infinitely nece&s;&s;ary; which Practice how|ever needful, and mo&s;t commendable in it &s;elf, yet by accident may have rai&s;ed higher the opinion of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> and is often the occa&s;ion of great Error in the thing it &s;elf.</P>
<P>For &s;uppo&s;e a Man followed with &s;ound and affe|ctionate Per&s;wa&s;ions, to do all that may be done for his Soul in this exigent; how conceiveable is it, that Man may be &s;o far wrought upon, as to enter|tain a pre&s;ent &s;en&s;e of Religion, and yet have no true Life, no Life that ari&s;es from a true intimate Principle. But as tho&s;e Bodies of Air taken, and moved by Angels &s;eem to perform the Functions of living Bodies, yet do but &s;eem to do &s;o, for they have no Principle of Life natural to them; but as &s;oon, as they are for&s;aken by the Spirits that made u&s;e of them, they fly abroad, and di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves. Thus that general &s;en&s;e of Con&s;cience, that lies &s;cat|tered
<PB N="42" REF="127"> through the Soul, and unable for action, being gathered together and united by good and holy Ap|plications, and acted thereby, may have force &s;o long, as that Union continues; but that Di&s;cour&s;e that holds it together cea&s;ing, it immediately falls a&s;under, and lo&s;es its Efficacy.</P>
<P>The Stone that receives motion from the Hand, that throws it, goes on whil&s;t that motion la&s;ts, when that is &s;pent, it falls to the ground: &s;o the force of Exhortation cea&s;es too often, when he that gives it, leaves tho&s;e to whom it was given.</P>
<P>The In&s;trument to which the Mu&s;ician's Hand gives tune and voice, lies dead when he de&s;erts it: Mans Soul is made by God capable of religious tune and motion, and while a skillful hand plays upon it, it may give that &s;ound very di&s;tinctly, and yet have no Life in it &s;elf.</P>
<P>The &s;triking of Con&s;cience makes the Sparks fly out, yea and &s;ometime kindle in a flame, and yet it pre&s;ently dies, becau&s;e not &s;upplied with a continual Oyl to feed it.</P>
<P>The Mind of one Man is very apt to receive Im|pre&s;&s;ions from another; we &s;ee what Pa&s;&s;ions and Motions are rai&s;ed by an Eloquent Speaker; how the Under&s;tanding is carried captive, while the Orator works upon it: and yet all the Affection thus blown up falls flat again, when the Breath that &s;well'd it lies &s;till, and is apt to be carried the contrary way by cro&s;s Per&s;wa&s;ions equally in&s;inuated.</P>
<P>How much more may this be in religious things? Con&s;cience being &s;o ea&s;ily &s;tirred by &s;uch Applicati|ons, as we &s;ee in <HI>Felix,</HI> though it is as ea&s;ily be|calmed, when &s;inful Lu&s;ts, through the Efficacy of Temptation, are loud and high.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="127">
<P>And all this is certainly much ea&s;ilier done near Death, when Men are &s;o &s;oft, that they are apt to take any &s;tamp; &s;o melting, as to be gathered into any mould.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible for one Man's Spirit to carry another for &s;ome con&s;iderable &s;pace of time, as we &s;ee in <HI>Jehoiadas</HI> influence upon <HI>Joa&s;h,</HI> who was not yet all that time po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the things them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>King.</HI> 12.1.</NOTE> whereunto he was directed.</P>
<P>But true Repentance is a Frame &s;et up by the Spi|rit of God in the Heart, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting by that Spirit up|on it &s;elf, and makes u&s;e only of all Helps &s;ubordi|nated to it, by the Wi&s;dom of that Spirit; but doth not live from that Help, but from it &s;elf through that Spirit, its &s;upreme Life.</P>
<P>To draw the&s;e things therefore to a Sum, It will appear, after all the&s;e Cau&s;es have done, what they can, the&s;e great Errors following are generally found, and always to be &s;u&s;pected in a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. In a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> There is only a Judgment made of the Ca&s;e of Eternity, con&s;idered by it &s;elf, and without a Conterpoi&s;e: The Excel|lency of God and Eternal Things are minded, as they &s;tand out of the Air of Temptation. Now though this be a good Opportunity for the fir&s;t con|&s;ideration, yet that Con&s;ideration mu&s;t grow &s;o &s;trong, as to retain the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, in the mid&s;t of all Pretences from the World and Sathan. El&s;e in the time of Temptation this Re|pentance falls away.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Jack&s;on, <HI>Book</HI> 10. <HI>Chap.</HI> 23. <HI>Sect.</HI> 3.</NOTE> <Q REND="inline">For there may be many true Appre|hen&s;ions, which may make deep
<PB N="44" REF="128"> Impre&s;&s;ion not only in the Brain and Phancy, and upon our Affections, while&s;t the&s;e are calm, and unprovok'd, and yet both the Apprehen&s;ion and Impre&s;&s;ion quickly vani&s;h upon the &s;tarting, or provocation of contrary Fancies or Affections.</Q></P>
<P>When the Blood cools in the Veins, and the Spi|rits are ready to &s;tand &s;till, when a Man is no lon|ger to live in the World, <HI>the &s;ea&s;on of the plea&s;ures of Sin is over,</HI> then to ca&s;t out his Lu&s;ts, <HI>What excellent thing does he? does not even nature,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 5.46.</NOTE> <HI>whether he will or no, the &s;ame?</HI> True Repen|tance encounters Temptation, and re&s;i&s;ts unto Blood, when tho&s;e Plea&s;ures of Sin are at the height, and the tide of Corruption from within &s;wells mo&s;t. <HI>As</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>cho&s;e to &s;uffer affliction with the people of God rather than to enjoy the plea&s;ures of &s;in for a &s;ea&s;on,</HI> Heb. 11.25. although they were in their growing, and a&s;cending Morning. Repentance will not wor&s;hip that Sun in the Ea&s;t. It is a very &s;mall thing to de&s;pi&s;e it in the We&s;t, and ju&s;t a &s;etting; to choo&s;e Religion, when there is nothing to vie with it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not a Con&s;ideration of heavenly Things in their true worth, but only as recommended by the pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ity. For who would not die the Death of the Righteous, and have his latter end like his? Every Man at that time would be glad to find, he hath lived well; and he that hath lived wor&s;t, except he be outrageous in Prophanene&s;s, will wi&s;h he had lived better. Eternity at hand gives value to all Holine&s;s and &s;en&s;e of God, in &s;pight of the World; and le&s;&s;ens all things el&s;e to <HI>a nothing, and le&s;s than nothing;</HI> imprints a Gha&s;tline&s;s and Horror upon all Wickedne&s;s and
<PB N="45" REF="128"> Sen&s;uality. <HI>The thirty pieces are nothing worth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 27.3.</NOTE> and the <HI>innocent blood above all value,</HI> when Men &s;uffer in the Agonies of Con&s;cience, and Fears of the approaching Judge. <HI>A Hou&s;e full of Silver and Gold</HI> will not buy a Man to re&s;i&s;t God, when in|deed he appears to him; <HI>when the terrible Maje&s;ty</HI> opens it &s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Numb.</HI> 22.18.</NOTE> what is &s;o precious, that Men <HI>will not fling to the Bats and Moles?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 2.20.</NOTE> When the Breath is go|ing out of the No&s;trils, how precious is Repentance, Faith, a Pardon in Chri&s;t, a happy Eternity, to tho&s;e, who have heretofore &s;lighted them, as the off-&s;couring of all things?</P>
<P>But the&s;e things are always &s;o rich, Wi&s;dom is always &s;o precious, that it di&s;dains to borrow E&s;teem from a minute of Extremity; and therefore it mo&s;t often falls out, that tho&s;e who would none of its coun&s;el, but de&s;pi&s;ed all its Reproof, when they come to &s;eek it early, cannot find it, but it laughs at their Calamity, as Men laugh at the unhappine&s;s of Fools, that would not be corrected in their Folly, till their Mi&s;ery confute their Confidence.</P>
<P N="3">3. From hence it follows, That this Repentance is a Choice, when there is no other Choice: If a Man loved his Sins, or the World never &s;o pa&s;&s;ion|ately, he mu&s;t leave them; if he di&s;liked God, and his Holine&s;s, and an everla&s;ting Abode with him, to the utmo&s;t; yet he is even forced upon them, or da&s;hed upon an Eternal Mi&s;ery, and Unhappine&s;s, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to choo&s;e: And therefore though he would not choo&s;e the holy ways of God, if he might &s;till enjoy former Vanity, yet that being
<PB N="46" REF="129"> out of his reach and way, he mu&s;t take what is to be had. The Sen&s;e therefore is no more than this, All the&s;e things are good, when a Man is ju&s;t a Dy|ing; but while he lives, and can have the World, they are trouble&s;om and unprofitable: Death makes them good, upon this account only, becau&s;e el&s;e there would be &s;omething wor&s;e, and there can no longer be any thing better. A Man is now willing to offer a Life he hath not to give, but Eternal Life is not worth any part of that Life he thinks in his power to do any thing el&s;e with. Let us then ob|&s;erve at what rate it is &s;et; for to u&s;e <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s words in another Ca&s;e, we may thus Rea&s;on.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Quale bonum hoc e&s;t, quod melius e&s;t, poe|na, quod non pote&s;t videri bonum, ni&s;i pe&s;&s;imo compa|ratum; ut ideo bonum &s;it re&s;i|pi&s;cere, quia deterius est ar|dere.

But if it mu&s;t purcha&s;e the Reputa|tion of being Good from Evil, it is not &s;o much a Good, as a lower degree of Evil; which while the greater Evil Eclip&s;es it is compelled as it were to accept the name of a good, being dri|ven upon the confines of Good|ne&s;s by the Violence of greater Evil.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. This Repentance is not the Free, but in&s;laved Judgment and Choice of the Soul; as Men ca&s;t out
<PB N="47" REF="129"> Goods in a Storm, and receive a Power to Rule over them, that they cannot endure, but that it is too &s;trong for them. Men are afraid what God will do to them, therefore they &s;ubmit. His Enemies in Heart are found Lyers to him, they flatter him with their Mouth, as <HI>Julian</HI> oppre&s;&s;ed by the Almighti|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, is &s;toried to have cried out, <HI>Vici&s;ti Galilaee,</HI> Thou ha&s;t overcome me, <HI>Galilean.</HI> Thus they are overcome by Death, and the apprehen&s;ion of Judgment. In the &s;ight and view of the Danger Men re&s;olve to part with their Sins. Let but that re|move, they call for their Sins again, as Mariners wi&s;h for their Goods after the Storm. They throw up their Lu&s;ts in their &s;ickne&s;s, but drink them in when their trouble is pa&s;t, <HI>as the Dog returns to his vomit,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.22. In all this there is nothing of the love of God.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this Repentance, the Soul of it is generally a pitiful mean Self-love, even the meane&s;t kind imaginable, wherein a Man con&s;iders him&s;elf as a Creature in being, and likely, or at lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible to be for ever; without any apprehen&s;ion of him&s;elf, as a rational Creature made for God, and the Enjoy|ment of him, in conforming with whom his Happi|ne&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and in the re&s;ting for ever in his love. Of this part he hath no di&s;tinct apprehen&s;ion, only he would be happy though he knows not what it is, or rather he would not be mi&s;erable; yet even that he truly under&s;tands not. But as the Jews &s;aid to Chri&s;t, when he &s;pake to them of the Bread of Life, <HI>Lord ever more give us this bread;</HI> and yet were &s;candalized at his Explanation of him&s;elf to be that Bread, &s;o far as to leave him.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 6.34.</NOTE> And the Phari&s;ees hearing <HI>of the Vineyard to be let out to other Hus|band-men,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="130"> and the Judgment up|on them&s;elves to be executed,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luk.</HI> 20.16.</NOTE> Cried out, <HI>God forbid,</HI> yet run on in the Sin, that brought it upon them.</P>
<P>This little point of Self-love into which all is crowded is ennobled with no &s;ight of the Excellency of the things them&s;elves, or a due E&s;timation of them, as the true plea&s;ure, and joy of an Immortal Spirit.</P>
<P>This is not that allowable love of a Man's &s;elf, which incircles it &s;elf within the love of God, as the le&s;&s;er Circle is comprehended by the greater, but this either leaves out that love wholly, or deba&s;es it to ba&s;e&s;t &s;elf.</P>
<P>Let us now compare both &s;ides together, and &s;ee how much true Repentance differs from that, which is always to be feared, le&s;t it &s;hould be the height of the Death-Bed: And of that which hath been &s;poken, this is the Sum,</P>
<P>True Repentance is the mo&s;t free Election of the Soul inabled by the Grace of God, upon a clear, and ju&s;t Dictate of the Judgment, attended with &s;in|cere&s;t Affection, to give up it &s;elf to God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and when it is mo&s;t it &s;elf, not under any irregular fear or con&s;traint, and (at lea&s;t would be the &s;ame) in a time, when it hath all the probabi|lity that can be to lay hold upon things pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The other Repentance ari&s;es from a Soul all trou|bled, and di&s;compo&s;ed with the throws of Death, the fears of Hell, the Doubts what will become of it in another World, the Uproars of a guilty Con&s;ci|ence; when it &s;uppo&s;es it &s;elf nece&s;&s;arily at the full &s;top of its former Cour&s;es, by being cut off from longer Life, in the mid&s;t of all which ari&s;e vehement Re&s;olutions to turn from Sin to God, and po&s;&s;ibly
<PB N="49" REF="130"> with many fair Apparences, but without opportuni|ty to give proof of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Let any one Judge between the&s;e two Repentan|ces, and accordingly even coun&s;el him&s;elf concern|ing them.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t acknowledge this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;ubject to the&s;e following Limitations.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Arguments I have in&s;i&s;ted upon pre|vail not only again&s;t a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> but again&s;t all Repentances, that have no higher Spirit to move them, than what I have now repre&s;ented; from hence therefore we may take the trial of our Repentance in general, for though a Death-Bed is mo&s;t &s;ubject to the&s;e mi&s;takes, yet whatever Re|pentance falls under them, is by rea&s;on of them in|valid; and the later any Repentance is, or the more it is occa&s;ioned by any Extremity, which it doth not out-live, the more &s;ubject it is to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. What I have &s;aid is not at all to be under&s;tood of the perfecting and con&s;ummating Repentance, by higher and fuller Acts towards God at Death, though enforced by the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of the Ca&s;e. For true Repentance running through the whole life, takes advantage of every thing, much more of &s;o con|&s;iderable an Opportunity to unite all our &s;trength for God, as a Death-bed brings with it. All that hath been &s;poken is de&s;igned again&s;t tru&s;ting to the <HI>Extreme &V;nction</HI> of a dying Repentance, ju&s;t then begun.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have before re&s;olved upon that tendere&s;t Do|ctrin, that it is po&s;&s;ible among all the unhappy Cir|cum&s;tances of a Dying-Bed, there yet may be this true Act of the Under&s;tanding, Will, and Affections turning to God; and if there be this, it would be the &s;ame and alike, however the&s;e Circum&s;tances
<PB N="50" REF="131"> alter, and then it excels tho&s;e temporary Amend|ments undertaken in the free&s;t times of Life. But becau&s;e it is but po&s;&s;ible and &s;o almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, &s;o unhappy a Ca&s;e, (as not to have repented till ju&s;t we die) &s;hould fall out &s;o happily, the Intention of this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;tands good notwith&s;tanding.</P>
<P N="4">4. I acknowledge, the choice of the Soul can never be &s;o free, but it mu&s;t be &s;ubject to infinitely the mo&s;t worthy and preponderating con&s;iderations of the love and goodne&s;s of God, the Redemption of Chri&s;t, the greatne&s;s of eternal Happine&s;s mo&s;t indear|ing on one &s;ide; of the fear and terror of the Lord, the lo&s;s of a Soul, everla&s;ting perdition, mo&s;t per|&s;wa&s;ive on the other &s;ide; &s;o that if a Man cannot be free in his choice of Religion, except he choo&s;e it without the force of any &s;uch con&s;ideration, he can never be at all free, for the&s;e are on all &s;ides of him: And further, there is always the &s;upream motion of the Grace of God, which does not le&s;&s;en, but &s;teer and exalt the freedom of the Will towards God.</P>
<P>The difference then between true and fal&s;e Re|pentance in this particular is the &s;ame, that is, be|tween ju&s;t and rational con&s;ideration of all the mo|tives of Hope and Fear; and the hurry of them moving us not intellectually, but as a Tempe&s;t, or with the force of a meer Engine. 2. Between the highe&s;t rea&s;ons carrying the chiefe&s;t force, and leading along with them the lower ones, and the lower doing all without the higher, for want of which they are Sen&s;ual or Helli&s;h. 3. Between the government of meer Providence, and of the Spirit of God. 4. Between the Repentance of <HI>Cain, E&s;au, Saul, Judas,</HI> and the Repentance of <HI>David, Mana&s;|&s;eh, Peter,</HI> and <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<PB N="51" REF="131">
<P N="5">5. I acknowledge the fir&s;t Preparations of the Soul by God for him&s;elf, may be with a great deal of noi&s;e and confu&s;ion; <HI>Clouds and Darkne&s;s are the Du&s;t of his Feet, Storms go before him to prepare his way;</HI> while the&s;e la&s;t, there cannot be a &s;erene calm Act of the Soul, and he that doth not live till he <HI>hear that &s;till Voice,</HI> in which God is, is in great danger of being lo&s;t in the Storm. But if out of this Darkne&s;s and Confu&s;ion, a holy and gracious Settlement pro|ceed, it is not the wor&s;e for being &s;o introduced, but is agreeable with the u&s;ual method of God.</P>
<P>The fourth Head I propo&s;ed, is to weigh the Re|pentance <HI>of the Crucified Malefactor</HI> again&s;t our common <HI>Death-Bed Repentances;</HI> which duly per|formed will be of great force again&s;t Pre&s;umption, rather than mini&s;ter it any Confidence.</P>
<P>For we &s;hall find &s;o much gathered together, and pre&s;&s;ed down into it, that as Jewels have their Rich|es in a little room, &s;o his &s;hort Life of Penitency had an Age of Repentance in it.</P>
<P>It is &s;o compo&s;ed of Extraordinaries, that it can give very little encouragement in ordinary Ca&s;es, except ju&s;t thus much; that Repentance at Death is no ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us ob&s;erve how his Repentance look'd to the &s;everal parts of Repentance; for though it had but little time in this World to breath in, yet with extraordinary diligence, it was bu&s;ie in all the great, and mo&s;t concerning Points. Yet I account this of the lea&s;t Remark in the Hi&s;tory of his Repen|tance, becau&s;e it is ea&s;ily imitable, That in which it Excelled, was the Evidences of Sincerity it car|ried.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="132">
<P N="1">1. Yet take notice of his Sen&s;e and Acknowledg|ment of Sin, which was not only a Confe&s;&s;ion of Words, but of his very Soul; for, deliberating things in a Moment, he pronounced him|&s;elf &s;elf worthy of the Condemnation and Puni&s;hment he endured.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Magnum e&s;t poenitentiae &s;ig|num in poena &s;ua acquie&s;cere. <HI>Grot.</HI> in locum.</NOTE> I confe&s;s this is not &s;o infrequent in tho&s;e, who forfeited their Lives to Ju&s;tice, but how oft is it rather a Formality, than the inward &s;en&s;e of the Mind condecently affected? and po&s;&s;ibly if we look upon the out-&s;ide of things, we can find no great difference between him and others. Yet it is a nece&s;&s;ary part of Repentance, <HI>The &s;acrifice of God is a broken and contrite heart,</HI> P&s;al. 51.17.</P>
<P N="2">2. In his Repentance lay a lively Faith in Chri&s;t; fir&s;t re&s;ting upon the principle, And truth of the thing; That <HI>Chri&s;t was a ju&s;t Per&s;on,</HI> that he <HI>had a Kingdom;</HI> and then a particular Application to him for Mercy, <HI>Lord remember me when thou come&s;t in thy Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A quick &s;en&s;e of Eternity &s;upplied Vigor to his Repentance, an evident &s;ight of &s;omething be|yond this world. For what more excites the Soul, and &s;hews it the nece&s;&s;ity of a gracious Change, than an everla&s;ting Condition appearing to it? To this end hath <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t brought life and immortality to light,</HI> 2 Tim. 1.10. of which this Penitent made a very full Confe&s;&s;ion; <HI>Lord remember me when thou come&s;t in thy Kingdom.</HI> He &s;aw a Kingdom beyond the Cro&s;s and Death.</P>
<P N="4">4. An earne&s;t de&s;ire to promote and propagate a &s;en&s;e of God into the Hearts of others was the im|mediate fruit of this Malefactors Repentance. He
<PB N="53" REF="132"> admoni&s;hes the Impenitent Thief on the other &s;ide, <HI>Do&s;t thou not fear God?</HI> He had &s;uch a Reverence of God, that he expo&s;tulates the want of it in the other as mon&s;trous and horrid. His de&s;ign was al&s;o exceeding Compa&s;&s;ionate, as well as Pious: For it was an Endeavour full of Charity, de&s;irous his guilty Fellow-&s;ufferer &s;hould be brought into the &s;ame Condition with him&s;elf. We want much of the Compa&s;&s;ion due to the Souls of others, becau&s;e we are &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of the mi&s;ery of our own; and ta&s;te but little of the &s;weetne&s;s of Reconciliation and Grace: But when we drink largely out of the&s;e Fountains, we derive the Streams upon others, that have flowed upon our &s;elves.</P>
<P>All the&s;e things were evidently much to the pur|po&s;e, if we look upon them&s;elves: Yet were there nothing more extraordinary in them, we might doubt whether they were any more than the good Mood, into which Principles of Con&s;cience excited by the unhappine&s;s his Condition might put him: Let us then con&s;ider the Evidence, that all this was truly Supernatural; for I account it no Injury to &s;o memorable a Repentance to &s;uppo&s;e, that as great and fair an out-&s;ide may have fail'd of Paradi&s;e, into which he entred. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. The acknowledgment he made of Chri&s;t gives te&s;timony to him in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. That it was made, when Chri&s;t was under all the Infamy, and Mi&s;ery of a &s;hameful and painful Death, and nothing to make &s;uch a Greatne&s;s, as he a&s;cribed to him probable. Among us that in gene|ral Language &s;peak honourably of Chri&s;t, Profe&s;&s;i|ons of him are cheap, and prove nothing. But if one bred in Turci&s;m, or Judai&s;m, &s;hould confe&s;s him,
<PB N="54" REF="133"> it would argue much more; yet not &s;o much as in this Malefactor, who &s;aw him in &s;o de&s;picable a State: Whereas now &s;o great a part of the World acknowledging him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 1.9.</NOTE> hath carried him up to Heaven, as it were <HI>in that Cloud, wherein he a&s;cended long ago,</HI> and hid <HI>the reproach of his Cro&s;s</HI> in &s;o high a Glory, e&s;pecially among us.</P>
<P>To confe&s;s him in his wor&s;t e&s;tate, and before any thing of the Con&s;equence was known, was very great:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Extrema fi|des, &s;ed non minima. <HI>Aug.</HI> Serm. <HI>122.</HI> de Temp.</NOTE> <HI>Chri&s;t was revealed to him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mat.</HI> 16.17.</NOTE> <HI>not by Fle&s;h and Blood;</HI> but by God him&s;elf.

<P>We find the Apo&s;tles, who had &s;een his Miracles, heard his Divine Di&s;cour&s;es, made long Acknow|ledgments of him, were fearfully &s;haken by this A&s;&s;ault <HI>of the power of Darkne&s;s upon him;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Rev.</HI> 3.18.</NOTE> even to a De&s;pair, that he was the Chri&s;t.

<PB N="55" REF="133"> this Faith with Chri&s;t triumphed over Principalities and Powers, even on the Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>We looking upon the things of Chri&s;tianity in the common Profe&s;&s;ion of the Nation, It is a hard thing for us to &s;ee them otherwi&s;e, than that ca&s;ts them; as it would be for tho&s;e that have known nothing but the Religion of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> Pagani&s;m, or the Jewi&s;h Synagogue, to take up upon the &s;udden the Doctrin of Chri&s;tianity again&s;t their own.</P>
<P>We believing not with our own Faith, but Vul|gar Opinion, ea&s;ily make a Confe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t; yet oftentimes the Power and &s;aving Effect of it is far from us, as from tho&s;e that are Strangers to him: &s;ometimes they that come from the Ea&s;t, and from the We&s;t, &s;it down in the Kingdom of God, when the Children of the Kingdom are thru&s;t out.</P>
<P>The Acknowledgment of Chri&s;t in tho&s;e Times, was a much fairer Evidence, than it can be now; yet without inward Grace was nothing then; much le&s;s mu&s;t it needs be to us, who have it made ready to our hands by Education and common Con&s;ent in it; we mu&s;t therefore the more narrowly ob&s;erve, what Characters the Truth of Chri&s;t imprints upon our Hearts.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Acknowledgment was made without any manner of In|ducement, or Temptation to it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tanto namque pondere appen|&s;um e&s;t, tantum|que valuit apud eum, qui novit haec appendere, quod confe&s;&s;us e&s;t Dominum Crucifixum, quantum &s;i fui&s;&s;et pro Domino Cruci|fixus. <HI>Aug.</HI> De Anima &amp; ejus Origine.</NOTE> from outward advantages, it could po&s;&s;ibly afford; but rather an in|crea&s;e of Shame and Scorn was to be expected from it; and that if it were po&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould &s;uffer
<PB N="56" REF="134"> the &s;econd time for &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion, and become of a Malefactor a Martyr. Nay further, there was no Dictate of Natural Con&s;cience, that could in|cline him to it; for that runs not into the Confe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, nor is any way quieted concerning former Sins through &s;uch a Confe&s;&s;ion; but eyes God only, and Moral Righteou&s;ne&s;s: La&s;tly, no general Tra|dition prompted him to it, the Jews at that time condemning him. But in us, all Applications to Chri&s;t are &s;ecuring our &s;elves in the common Barque, and keep us from being cen&s;ured, as prophane, and irreligious Per&s;ons. For to die without any addre&s;s to Chri&s;t, is accounted very ungodly, and &s;en&s;le&s;s of a Future State; but to deny him, mon&s;trous and de&s;perate. Further, Chri&s;tianity is incorporated with our natural Principles, &s;o that they never move, or heave them&s;elves in us, but that al&s;o ri&s;es with them.</P>
<P>Now it is of great Importance in the tryal of Sin|cerity, upon what Grounds and Motives we do, what do; and the more we can clear it from inferiour Springs, the more certainly it is <HI>Grace de&s;cending from above, and re&s;ting upon us,</HI> Jam. 1.17.</P>
<P>Every one therefore that would ju&s;tifie a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> mu&s;t exceed all common &s;orts of Repentance, el&s;e he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.

<P>And do but think, if our Faith were to cut tho&s;e waves, his was to pa&s;s, to row again&s;t &s;uch a Stream, <HI>to remove &s;uch mountains,</HI> among how many thou|&s;ands

<P>But after all I will allow it po&s;&s;ible, there might be a &s;ecret flaw in this whole Penitent's Deportment, we now in&s;i&s;t upon; and that it far'd with him as with &s;ome among us, who after a wicked and de|bauched Life fly to the Sanctuary of the Romi&s;h Re|ligion (<HI>as</HI> Joab <HI>to the horns of the Altar,</HI> 1 King. 2.28.) To Reconciliation wherewith Hopele&s;ne&s;s of any good from that they have &s;o long &s;inned again&s;t, and natural Super&s;tition hurry them. So this Per&s;on hearing a great Fame of Chri&s;t, and ob|&s;erving his pretence high, might lay hold upon him in a de&s;perate Ca&s;e, if peradventure any thing of good might follow on it: It being very incidental to the Nature of Man to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon Religion, when all el&s;e fails, and upon one new to him, when he hath offended again&s;t the old one, beyond hope of Pardon; whence Men generally receive this Recom|pence, that Con&s;cience is put into amu&s;e, having nothing at pre&s;ent to &s;ay again&s;t it.</P>
<P>And had this been the top of his Ca&s;e, that it had been thus, could it have been &s;aving? Nay, that it might po&s;&s;ibly have been thus, though indeed it had been otherwi&s;e, yet this very liablene&s;s to &s;uch a mi&s;take had un&s;peakably abated the rational Secu|rity, and &s;afety of his Condition, &s;o that there had remained good cau&s;e for Con&s;cience to have mi|&s;tru&s;ted which way his Condition would have fallen to Eternity.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="135">
<P N="3">3. The Third thing therefore, that gave him, and gives to all Ages undoubted Te&s;timony of the Truth of his Conver&s;ion, is the immediate atte&s;ta|tion to that Truth and Sincerity of it, <HI>This day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e.</HI> Now that Repen|tance which enters into Heaven, that pa&s;&s;es into Pa|radi&s;e, not hinder'd by tho&s;e <HI>flaming Cherubs of Divine Truth;</HI> that which is <HI>within the Door, be|fore the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e is ri&s;en up and hath &s;hut it to,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 13.25.</NOTE> that is true Repentance and pro&s;perous, and &s;ucce&s;sful, how late &s;oever.

<P>The la&s;t thing I take notice of in this Repentance, is the unparallellable Circum&s;tance of time wherein it was accepted.</P>

It is again&s;t all the Prudence and Providence of a Man, &s;eeing no Man knows what kind of Death he &s;hall die; whether it will afford him the po&s;&s;ibili|ties of Repenting: How many die &s;uddenly, and in &s;o &s;hort a Breath, that they have not time to de&s;ire Mercy in general? How many of Apoplexies &s;eizing upon the very Top of Sen&s;e at fir&s;t? Many by Phren|&s;ies have no rational Motions of them&s;elves; innu|merable Accidents (and oft-times made dreadful by the Wickedne&s;s wherewith they have been accom|panied) have &s;natch'd away Men in a Moment. <HI>Such are taken away living and in his wrath before the Pots can feel the Thorns,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 58.9.</NOTE> before ever tho&s;e ha|&s;ty flames of Motion towards God blown up for &s;uch an Extremity can be rai&s;ed. Such are taken in the very manner without &s;o much time as to put off the Every-Day Habit of Sin, <HI>like tho&s;e that were carried out dead in their Coats,</HI> Lev. 10.5.</P>
<P>And though from the ordinary manner of Dying, we may hope for the warning ordinarily given; yet we &s;ee others &s;urprized, who have had the &s;ame rea&s;ons of Hope with our &s;elves. We cannot then without madne&s;s tru&s;t our &s;elves to accident, <HI>or boa&s;t our &s;elves of to morrow,</HI> of which we know not what is with|in it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 27.1.</NOTE> &s;eeing the future is wholy concealed from us: <HI>They that make a Covenant

<P>Let a Man examine, whether he can choo&s;e his Death, and de&s;ign the Circum&s;tances of it, and place every thing ju&s;t as he would have it, and there|by afford him&s;elf the Sea&s;on he thinks nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch a purpo&s;e.

<P>This is the greate&s;t Immorality and Irreligion; for it de&s;troys the rea&s;on of our Being on Earth, which is <HI>to &s;erve our Generation,</HI> or <HI>the cour&s;e of our Life accord|ing to the Will of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 13.36.</NOTE> <HI>to glorifie him here on Earth.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 17.4.</NOTE> It de&s;troys the Service, yet flies upon the Re|ward; as if God were bound to make Men happy, becau&s;e he had made them, and that he had made them, fir&s;t to take the Delights he mo&s;t abhors, to

<P>Thus therefore to imagine of God is to bring down in our own Thoughts tho&s;e great Attributes of Ju&s;tice and Wi&s;dom, into a fooli&s;h and unrea&s;on|able Pity, and only for this end, that there may be a Licentiou&s;ne&s;s in Wickedne&s;s and Impiety.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing upon the &s;ame account, all the Men in the World may adjourn their Love and Obedi|ence to God to their going out of it; it might come to pa&s;s, that this State &s;hould have been prepared only as a Stage for the Vices and Exorbitancies of Men to have acted them&s;elves upon, and then they to have removed to Heaven; when as though the&s;e have large &s;cope indeed now, as things are, yet their Licentiou&s;ne&s;s is daily rebuked by the threats of the Go&s;pel, by the holy Conver&s;ations of tho&s;e, that have left their Sins by Repentance, and puni&s;h|ed by an Eternal Judgment hereafter.</P>
<P>But who that con&s;iders the infinite Goodne&s;s and Greatne&s;s of God, <HI>that in his hand is our life, and breath, and all our ways,</HI> can think it equal, that God &s;hould have only the faint and feeble Services of a Death-Bed, for all the Pre&s;ervation and Mercy vouch&s;afed through the cour&s;e of our lives?</P>
<P>Or who can think it con&s;i&s;tent with his Honour to give Men Laws, that point upon the Government

<P>Or lea&s;t of all, who can believe? that Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould come a Redeemer into the World, <HI>a Redeem|er from all Iniquity, a purcha&s;er from a vain Con|ver&s;ation, that he might have a peculiar People zealous of good works;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tit. 2.14.</NOTE> <HI>who &s;hould look for the great day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 2.7.</NOTE> <HI>and his glorious ap|pearance, by a patient expectation and continuance in well-doing;</HI> to which he hath al&s;o tied them by the mo&s;t &s;trict Obligations, that created Nature is capable of, and yet that this in a manner &s;hould be wholly fru&s;trated, even in tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to be redeemed by him?</P>

<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4. It is impo&s;&s;ible to a Man to die with good com|po&s;ure of Mind, that tru&s;ts to a Dying Repentance; for let the Ca&s;e be thus &s;tated, That Repentance, which will not inable a Man to a holy Life, is not &s;aving; &s;uppo&s;e a Man then in a Dying Sickne&s;s, ma|king great acknowledgment of Sin, full of Re&s;olu|tions of leaving Sin, and this Man recovering and peforming nothing, but &s;liding back into the for|mer Wretchedne&s;s of Life; this Repentance how|ever &s;erious, and earne&s;t it &s;eemed, would not have &s;aved him, if he had died; he had peri&s;hed in his Sins, and his fal&s;e Repentance together: For that his Repentance was truly inferior to his Sins, appears, in that as &s;oon as ever that is over, which gave it a &s;eeming Advantage, his Sins throw off that Repentance;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rev. 2.7, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> but true Repentance always <HI>overcomes;</HI> that Repentance therefore could not be true.</P>
<P>And if Repentance be fal&s;e and counterfeit, there is no amendment of it in Eternity; when once the <HI>Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e is ri&s;en up, and hath &s;hut to the Door,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 13.25.</NOTE> there is no entrance: While the <HI>fooli&s;h

<P>Yea though a Man may &s;eem to be well quieted, and comforted, and to have the Te&s;timony of the Spirit of God, yet all this may be but a Delu&s;ion, and <HI>Satan in an Angel of light;</HI> for though they that have truly this Te&s;timony, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to know it is that true Spirit; yet they that have it not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11.14.</NOTE> may have &s;ome|thing, they &s;o &s;trongely imagine to be it, that thereby they may be deceived. This Te&s;timony therefore mu&s;t be proportionable to the a&s;&s;urance, this Dying Man had from Chri&s;t; el&s;e even a Man that dies &s;afe, mu&s;t die in &s;uch an un|expre&s;&s;ible Torment of Mind, that it had been much better he had enjoyed no &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons of Sin, than only endure that. And who can pre&s;ume &s;o upon God, as to promi&s;e him&s;elf &s;uch a train of Miracles to carry him not only to Heaven, but without tho&s;e Agonies of Horror that are like Hell, after &s;o long Impenitency?</P>
<P>Thus on all &s;ides it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for every one to Repent while he may behold the Truth of his Re|pentance in the ordinary Fruits of a holy Life; and &s;ee him&s;elf in all the Circum&s;tances of Temptation, change of Condition, Varieties, which Life and the Cour&s;e of it carry along with it: For that is often by length of time ca&s;t up, and appears upon the Surface, that lay concealed at the bottom, till &s;uch a Concurrence of things gives it the advantage to ri&s;e.</P>
<PB N="70" REF="141">
<P>I under&s;tand nothing that can be objected to this la&s;t Argument I have u&s;ed to di&s;able the Confidence of &s;uch a Repentance, except this.</P>
<P>It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, the Repentance that is full of pa&s;&s;ionate and affectionate Motions towards God, though amid&s;t the fears of Death, may be good, till it be blotted out by returns to Sin, and therefore if it be taken in the ju&s;t time, while it is good; that is, if a Man dies before it be rever&s;ed, it may &s;erve the great purpo&s;e of Eternity.</P>
<P>This Suppo&s;ition I mu&s;t confe&s;s hath a &s;eeming Countenance from that particular place, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 33.12. <HI>The righteou&s;ne&s;s of the righteous &s;hall not deliver him in the day of his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; as for the wick|edne&s;s of the wicked, he &s;hall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>But if the &s;cope of Scripture-Di&s;cour&s;e in general, or the very &s;en&s;e of Morality be taken in the Ca&s;e, no Man may tru&s;t &s;o great a weight here; For Chri&s;t looks upon <HI>the &s;tony ground</HI> with the &s;ame Eye, <HI>while it receives the word with joy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 1.3.20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>as when by and by it is offended;</HI> and it was therefore truly no better at fir&s;t than at la&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 7.26.</NOTE> <HI>The Hou&s;e that is not foun|ded upon the Rock,</HI> is as ill founded in the Calm, as in the Storm, only the Storm di&s;covers what it was. Morality it &s;elf requires a better rooting of virtuous Habits, than that they &s;hould be &s;et only in loo&s;e Ground, thrown up by Extremity of Condition, and not in the Soil it &s;elf.</P>
<P>That Repentance which will not bear the trial of time, will much le&s;s &s;u&s;tain the Te&s;t of Eternity, wherein every thing that &s;tands, mu&s;t be &s;olid and
<PB N="71" REF="141"> &s;ub&s;tantial: Things that &s;uffer the lo&s;s of them&s;elves, when they are tried <HI>by mans day,</HI> will &s;uddenly be con&s;umed by the hotter Beams of God. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.3.</P>
<P>That hath need of good Founding, that mu&s;t un|dergo an Eternity, and have all advantage of Con|coction, that mu&s;t be laid up for ever; which the &s;hort Moments of a Death-Bed without a miraculous A&s;&s;i&s;tance will not allow. The Fruit of it general|ly, like <HI>that Ha&s;ty-ripe, peri&s;hes while it is in the Hand:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;ai. 28.4.</NOTE> This Repentance gives up the Gho&s;t, as &s;oon as it is born.</P>
<P>Now as for that place in <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> &s;o much vexed with Controver&s;ie, I do not think it convenient for me to intangle a Di&s;cour&s;e intended wholly for pra|ctice with the Perplexities of it.</P>
<P>Only I am concerned to &s;hew, that it doth not afford the favour &s;uppo&s;ed to this kind of Repen|tance. For fir&s;t, We mu&s;t not mi&s;take <HI>the day</HI> it &s;peaks of, as if it &s;ignified &s;o &s;trait a compa&s;s of Time, as a Day; but that Sea&s;on wherein either the righteous Man wa&s;ts and de&s;troys his Righteou&s;ne&s;s; or a Sinner over comes his Vitious Cu&s;toms and In|clinations, neither of which are u&s;ually done on the &s;udden. Secondly, <HI>The turning from Wickedne&s;s</HI> intended is certainly a &s;incere and impartial one, and not &s;uch as we have rendred this Dying Repentance &s;u&s;picious to be. Thirdly, It mu&s;t be ju&s;tified <HI>by a walking in the Statutes and Judgments of God, and doing that is right;</HI> that is, by a continued Re|formation, which will lea&s;t agree to this Repen|tance, and therefore this place of Scripture will not protect this Suppo&s;ition, but rather damns it.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="142">
<P>Having now in the foregoing Di&s;cour&s;e, in a pra|ctical and per&s;wa&s;ive way, endeavoured to engage Men to a timely Repentance, by &s;etting out the hazard of a late one: I have thought it nece&s;&s;ary, to make the &s;tate of the whole Doctrin, as exact as I can, by con&s;idering whatever might with fair appearance of Scripture-Rea&s;on call into que&s;tion and &s;cruple, what I have grounded my Per&s;wa&s;ions upon.</P>
<P>I will therefore, as a Supplement to all I have &s;aid, Fir&s;t recollect what I have intended all along.

<P N="2">2. Nor Secondly, Whether God hath re&s;erved it to the Prerogative of his Grace, to give a true Re|pentance at la&s;t?</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor Thirdly, Whether a Repentance that is true and &s;incere, though but in the Seeds, being &s;urprized with a Death-Bed, may not then break out and &s;hew it &s;elf more fully?</P>
<P N="4">4. Nor La&s;tly, Whether a Man that hath the light of the Go&s;pel brought to him, but ju&s;t before his Dying Condition, may not expect the Grace of God working with it then, even as in the freer times of Life?</P>
<P><HI>All the&s;e I do</HI> with great Confidence acknow|ledge: The Sub&s;tance of what I have &s;aid again&s;t a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> will be compri&s;ed in the&s;e

<P>The Fir&s;t is, That a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> how fair &s;oever, it may appear, hath yet the greate&s;t Doubt imaginable upon it, whether it be true.</P>

<P>La&s;tly, That it is therefore again&s;t all rules of Pie|ty and Prudence, by mi&s;pending Life to ca&s;t our &s;elves upon the nece&s;&s;ity of Repentance at Death.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, is the Sub&s;tance of what I have de|&s;igned all along, and which I would now further clear, and vindicate from the&s;e following Objections.</P>
<P><HI>Objection</HI> 1. Doth not the Parable of calling &s;ome Labourers into the Vineyard at the Eleventh Hour, imply, That God doth in ordinary Convert &s;ome at the la&s;t Hour, as well as &s;ooner?<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 20. <HI>v.</HI> 1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> The main &s;cope of Parables is only argu|mentative, and <HI>&s;o far as the &s;cope of</HI> that Parable relates to this Ca&s;e: It is no more, than what I acknowledge, That God gives Eternal Life to true
<PB N="74" REF="143"> Repentance, if true, at la&s;t, even as to the fir&s;t and earlie&s;t Repentance. The reward being to all of <HI>Grace, and not of Debt.</HI> It is al&s;o to be con&s;idered, there remained an Hour of working, repre&s;enting rather old Age, than a Death-Bed, if the colours of a Parable prove any thing, and &s;o are rather again&s;t this Repentance, than for it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Second Objection,</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e Men taking Sanctuary at infinite Mercy and Power in this man|ner.</P>
<P>Although no thought of Man can reach the Mercy, that accepts or gives Repentance at the la&s;t: yet Mercy being as much above our Thoughts, as the Heaven above the Earth, what can we define con|cerning it? And though there are &s;o many Circum|&s;tances of Impo&s;&s;ibility, according to our mea&s;ure of things; Yet the things that are impo&s;&s;ible with Men, with God are po&s;&s;ible; for with God all things are po&s;&s;ible: How can we then determine in this Ca&s;e? <HI>Can we by &s;earching find out the Almighty</HI> in his Mercy and Power? <HI>Can we find him out to perfection? It is high as Heaven, what can we do? It is deeper than Hell, what can we know? The mea&s;ure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broa|der than the Sea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;wer.</HI> Now becau&s;e in this <HI>Objection,</HI> the &s;i|news of all Hope and Expectation from this late Re|pentance meet; I will endeavour to give the mo&s;t punctual <HI>An&s;wer</HI> to it. And though I know after all, that is, or can be &s;aid, Men will not quit it: Yet I &s;hall re&s;t upon this <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> as my la&s;t Re&s;o|lution of this Ca&s;e; and by it rai&s;e the di&s;&s;wa&s;ions from a tru&s;t in &s;uch a Repentance to the height; the greatne&s;s of the hazard appearing mo&s;t fully from it.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="143">
<P>In general therefore it hath been noted, The que|&s;tion is not whether God accepts a true Repentance, how late &s;oever; but whether God will give a true Repentance &s;o late; and herein the que&s;tion is not of the limits, the ab&s;olute limits of infinite Mercy and Power; But what limits it hath &s;et to it &s;elf? and what Sea&s;ons it hath limited to us? and whether ac|cording to the&s;e a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> be not almo&s;t, if not altogether an Impo&s;&s;ibility? I'll therefore lay down &s;everal degrees of Impo&s;&s;ibility, notwith&s;tanding infinite Mercy and Power, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily abate the Irregular Confidence of &s;uch a Repentance, and under one of them I &s;hall be bold to place it.</P>
<P N="1">1. The highe&s;t degree of Impo&s;&s;ibility is, of tho&s;e things, that are utterly and ab&s;olutely <HI>impo&s;&s;ible with God,</HI> becau&s;e they are irreconcileable with his Na|ture, and &s;uch wherein if they were, <HI>he mu&s;t deny him&s;elf,</HI> which he cannot do. For though there is nothing above God, not &s;o much as any Goodne&s;s, or Righteou&s;ne&s;s ab&s;tracted from him&s;elf, that &s;hould give him Law; Yet he being him&s;elf that &s;u|preme Goodne&s;s and Righteou&s;ne&s;s, He is a Law to him&s;elf; His Nature is his &s;upreme and inviolable Law; And his Will &s;tands always even with his Na|ture: For his Will is him&s;elf reciprocal with his Na|ture; And all his Actions keep perfect Corre&s;pon|dence with his Will. Upon this immutable Rea&s;on <HI>God cannot lye,</HI> he cannot do any thing weak, or that argues Imperfection: He cannot but be righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Upon this Rea&s;on al&s;o he cannot, <HI>he will not acquit the guilty.</HI> He cannot, he will not &s;ave or make Men happy in their Sins. God him&s;elf &s;peaks this
<PB N="76" REF="144"> Sen&s;e, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.31, 32. and <HI>c.</HI> 33.11. <HI>As I live &s;aith the Lord, I have no plea&s;ure in the Death of him that dieth, why will ye die? Turn your &s;elves and live ye.</HI> As if he &s;hould &s;ay, except ye turn, all my Mercy can do you no good. For &s;uch a Mer|cy as God the <HI>Father</HI> of <HI>Mercies,</HI> will not give, would not be a Mercy, but either a fooli&s;h Softne&s;s, or loo&s;e Indulgence to Sin. Such a Power were not a Power, but an Impotency, or turning all things to Confu&s;ion. The&s;e therefore are as incon&s;i&s;tent with God, as Folly, Imperfection, Sin. The Go&s;|pel, the highe&s;t di&s;play of Mercy re&s;ts upon this Principle, being not a Salvation of Men in Sin, but a mo&s;t effectual Redemption of Men from Sin. Of all that God can be &s;uppo&s;ed to do for Men, there is nothing more impo&s;&s;ible than this, more repug|nant to all the true Sen&s;e of Man, more overthrow|ing of the undertaking of Chri&s;t, more contrary to the Nature of true Happine&s;s. An Opinion of the damned in Hell being annihilated, or recovered to Holine&s;s and Happine&s;s after &s;ome Ages of Torment, were a high Probability compar'd with this. He that can tempt him&s;elf to believe this, may believe any thing, and needs no Confutation, but his own Unrea&s;onablene&s;s. Again&s;t this I have been thus large, becau&s;e it &s;ecretly lurks in Mens Hearts, that God may &s;ave them without &s;o much ado about Faith and Repentance, though being afraid to &s;peak a thing &s;o mon&s;trous, they di&s;gui&s;e it under the Pre|tence of a faint Repentance at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But from what I have &s;aid, It is plainly to be in|ferred, Fir&s;t, That &s;ome things which God cannot, will not do, are not the reproach either of his Mercy or Power, but the Glory and Greatne&s;s of both. And this, that He neither can, or will &s;ave Men
<PB N="77" REF="144"> without &s;incere Faith and Repentance (that is with|out a recovery to Holine&s;s) is one of the&s;e things. The <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> then, that is <HI>unto Sal|vation,</HI> mu&s;t without all di&s;pute be a &s;incere Change from Sin to Holine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is an Impo&s;&s;ibility, that ari&s;es from the peremptory, and ab&s;olute, and irrepealable determi|nation of the Will and Council of God concerning any thing. In this degree of things I account,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I cannot ac|quie&s;ce in the Expo&s;ition of the Learned Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> in his Annota|tions concern|ing the&s;e two Ca&s;es.</NOTE> <HI>the unpardonablene&s;s of the Sin again&s;t the Divine Spi|rit. The unrenewablene&s;s of total Apostates from Chri&s;tianity to Repentance. The impo&s;&s;ibility of Repentance after this Life:</HI> Now though the&s;e carry not their own Evidence of being incon&s;i&s;tent with the Divine Nature, as the former; yet the Declaration of &s;upreme plea&s;ure again&s;t them is &s;o effectual, that we mu&s;t needs look upon them, as impo&s;&s;ible. And we may &s;ee a great con&s;ent, a high Congruity be|tween the things them&s;elves, and the Determination of God concerning them, which Rea&s;ons are yet clearer with God. For in the Sin again&s;t the Holy Gho&s;t there is &s;o mature, &s;o perfect, &s;o concocted a Wickedne&s;s, &s;o high a contumely again&s;t the God|head it &s;elf, that it is very irreconcileable with Re|pentance, and &s;o with Pardon. The total Apo&s;ta|cy from Chri&s;tianity, and the Evidences of it men|tioned <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. from the very Nature of the Ca&s;e ap|pears irreparable, becau&s;e there is no other or high|er Grace, than that of the Go&s;pel, for the Apo&s;tates to remove to; <HI>no more &s;acrifice for &s;in,</HI> nor are
<PB N="78" REF="145"> there any higher Evidences of that Go&s;pel, than tho&s;e he is &s;uppo&s;ed to revolt from; and no more perfect Acts of Contrariety to the Go&s;pel, than <HI>the crucifying the Son of God afre&s;h and putting him to an open &s;hame, the doing de&s;pite to the Spirit of Grace, the treading under foot the Son of God, and counting the Blood of the Covenant an unclean thing, in the Parallel place.</HI> Heb. 10.29.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all other Rea&s;ons, the unchangeable State of Eternity is &s;o con&s;olidate with, &s;o fixed into our very Being, that the Perpetuity of it is very account|able to our Rea&s;on; &s;o that there can be no Change after this Life.</P>
<P>From hence then, we derive thus much farther again&s;t a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance:</HI> Fir&s;t that &s;ome things, wherein we cannot find an expre&s;s Impo&s;&s;ibi|lity in their Nature, are yet made &s;o by Gods ab&s;o|lute Re&s;olution concerning them; into the Rea&s;on of which he al&s;o is plea&s;ed to give us &s;ome light: And that many Expre&s;&s;ions of Scripture (as, <HI>They &s;hall &s;eek me early but &s;hall not find me,</HI> the Parable of the fooli&s;h Virgins, with many others) make this Repentance very dangerous, with which al&s;o the very Rea&s;on of the Ca&s;e concurs; Yet not a|mounting to this kind of Impo&s;&s;ibility.</P>
<P N="3">3. There are &s;ome things impo&s;&s;ible according to the Rules, and general Laws of the Creation, and Government of the World, which we call Na|ture, and which Rules, infinite Wi&s;dom and Power hath &s;o pre&s;cribed to it &s;elf, that he hath yet re&s;erved to him&s;elf freedom to &s;hew him&s;elf above them, as Founder and Lord of Nature.</P>
<P>Thus it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Sun to &s;tand &s;till, to rai&s;e the Dead, that the Fire &s;hould not burn: That
<PB N="79" REF="145"> is, It is impo&s;&s;ible at all times, but when infinite Power is plea&s;ed to be &s;een riding in the Heavens, far above all Nature, that is, when he is plea&s;ed to work Miracles: &s;uitable to the&s;e Laws of the fir&s;t Creation, there are al&s;o Laws of the new and &s;econd Creation, <HI>viz.</HI> the Redemption of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>It is true, the new Creation, compared with the old, is &s;o far as it is new, <HI>All Miracle.</HI> Such is <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s without Works,</HI> Re|generation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 4.6.</NOTE> Such is the Incarna|tion, the Re&s;urrection. Even as the fir&s;t Creation and daily Pre&s;ervation are Miracles compared with <HI>that nothing,</HI> out of which all things were drawn, and are &s;till upheld.</P>
<P>Yet this very miraculous Frame of the Go&s;pel is bounded with certain Laws and Rules, and when the&s;e are tran&s;cended, it is a Miracle in this miracu|lous &s;tate of things.</P>
<P>Now all In&s;tances of miraculous Power are rare and extraordinary, and the Rea&s;ons of them, when they have been, have always been great and &s;o|lemn; and when they have been more plentiful in any Age, the Rea&s;ons have been great for that al&s;o. And in Miracle it &s;elf, there hath been always regard to the natural &s;tate of things. Miracle hath for the mo&s;t part lifted up Nature only, wherein it was ei|ther decayed, or not planted &s;o high, as the very effect to be wrought, and ju&s;t then de&s;igned; not minding the flouri&s;h of it &s;elf, but the main In|tention only: We read of no other Circum&s;tances but tho&s;e of ordinary Mortality, into which they that were rai&s;ed from the Dead in Scripture were exalted; only that they were rai&s;ed to Life.</P>
<P>In the new Creation, &s;o much of the old, as would &s;erve in it, is generally taken in; and the
<PB N="80" REF="146"> Con&s;titutions that will agree with the de&s;ign of Grace are upheld for the mo&s;t part; as were ea&s;ie to manife&s;t. Divine In&s;piration did not di&s;annul the natural Temper of the Prophets or Apo&s;tles; but they are ea&s;ily ob&s;ervable in their Writings. Con|ver&s;ion doth not de&s;troy, but &s;anctifie and renew Nature. For what doth all this &s;erve, but to &s;hew, God does as little as may be, decline from the fir&s;t Model of things, His Wi&s;dom &s;o deeply con|trived?</P>
<P>Further, the new Creation in all things excelling the old; as the whole State of it is never antiquated by a higher Revelation, &s;o the Laws of it are &s;el|dom exceeded by any thing extraordinary; yet I acknowledge, In&s;tances there are of Extraordina|ries, even here al&s;o.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle&s;hip was in a manner wholly mira|culous, yet the calling of the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;omething higher than that; for whereas the Twelve were trained, and educated in the Di&s;cipline and Conver&s;ation of Chri&s;t; and expre&s;s care in the Surrogation of one into the place of <HI>Judas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 1.21, 22.</NOTE> was had of &s;uch a Pre|paration, yet the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;uddenly born into that high Function and Au|thority, into which they were gradually admitted. But the rea&s;on al&s;o was very high, That there might be &s;o great a Proof of the Power of the Go&s;pel, as a Per&s;ecutor and Bla&s;phemer Preaching that Faith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 9.20, 21, 22.31. Gal. 1.23, 24.</NOTE> he had &s;o no|toriou&s;ly per&s;ecuted; and on the &s;udden, that it might be without the Su&s;picion of a Confederacy.</P>

<P>This of the Dying Malefactor, I E&s;teem of the &s;ame kind, and the Rea&s;on was extraordinary, as I have before ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>I have now thus fully di&s;cour&s;ed this Particular, becau&s;e it brings me to the ultimate Re&s;olution, I can make of this Ca&s;e; that is,</P>
<P>A <HI>Death-Bed Repentance</HI> whenever it is true, is a Grace and Favour vouch&s;afed to the Soul, in which it is found, above the ordinary and general Grace that gives Repentance. For it is above the&s;e four great Rules of the Go&s;pel, wherein al&s;o the fundamental Nature of things much con&s;pires.</P>
<P N="1">1. That God is jealous of the Glory of his Grace, and gives it by the &s;ame rule, he pre&s;cribes to us. <HI>To day, while it is called to day, hear his Voice.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God attempers his Grace to the &s;tate of Man's Soul, &s;o as not to permit to &s;uch a long hardning, and accu&s;tomedne&s;s in Sin, tho&s;e whom he intends to Convert.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Ingenuity and Freedom of the Soul ne|ce&s;&s;ary to Repentance is not ordinarily po&s;&s;ible, amid&s;t the Fears and Nece&s;&s;ity of Death.</P>
<PB N="82" REF="147">
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fruits meet for Repentance, and amendment Life, and the glorifying God upon Earth,</HI> by a ho|ly Conver&s;ation are univer&s;ally required. Such a Repentance then mu&s;t be proportionable to <HI>a Mira|cle, a Miracle in Grace.</HI> Now Miracles are &s;eldom, and not but upon &s;uch Rea&s;ons as exceed the value of tho&s;e Rules (at lea&s;t) in that Ca&s;e, wherein they are over-ruled; Rea&s;ons of greater Eminency than what daily fall out; but it is a daily Rea&s;on, that Men mu&s;t either Repent or Peri&s;h.

<P>The practical Conclu&s;ion then from hence is this, It is as pre&s;umptuous a <HI>Boa&s;t</HI> for a Man to think, He &s;hall Repent when he comes to die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 27.1.</NOTE> becau&s;e the Mercy and Power of God are infinite; as for him upon the &s;ame accounts, to leap into Seas, or roll him&s;elf in Flames, without fear of danger.</P>

<P><HI>Objection</HI> 5. Is it not at all times a great Folly, to promi&s;e <HI>a to morrow</HI> to Repentance, how long &s;oever we may live after that to morrow? becau&s;e we daily <HI>harden through the deceitfulne&s;s of &s;in.</HI> Is it not al&s;o always a curious Point, and that requires a great jea|lou&s;ie over it, whether our Hearts are at any time &s;incere in returns to God?

<P><HI>An&s;wer</HI> 1. Fir&s;t as concerning the time of Repen|tance, It is to be acknowledged; Every Man, that is come to the &s;trength and fixedne&s;s of his Under|&s;tanding, to the poize and inclination of his Will and Affections, to the habit and cu&s;tom of his Life and Actions, and hath not determined for God, hath great rea&s;on to fear; le&s;t as there is a deep print of the high hand of Nature upon his unconverted &s;tate, &s;o there &s;hould be a Seal of Ju&s;tice al&s;o, and this Doubt increa&s;es every day.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this; All Doubts and Scruples, that have an appearance of in&s;naring and intangling the minds of Men with fears, they begin too late, are to be avoided; if it be not &s;o late, that it is <HI>ju&s;t now dark, and their feet &s;tumbling upon the dark mountains;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Jer. 13.16.</NOTE> And the&s;e things being written e&s;pecially for the <HI>living,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;a. 38.19.</NOTE> who have in ordina|ry probability time to lo&s;e, the dan|ger is be&s;t placed here, where it takes them every way.</P>
<P>By the way of Encouragement; that the time is not yet pa&s;t, while they have the &s;paces of Life, and of the Patience of God; which is not <HI>a &s;lackne&s;s of Ju&s;tice</HI> but <HI>a de&s;igned Salvation.</HI> By the way of
<PB N="87" REF="149"> Caution, becau&s;e they know not how &s;oon they may be ca&s;t upon a Death-Bed, and this Patience be at an end: With Dying Men the ca&s;e is otherwi&s;e, who are already in the thicke&s;t of the Danger, and mu&s;t work them&s;elves out in that moment, or peri&s;h for ever; without any Injury therefore to them, <HI>the liv|ing</HI> are thus to be warned. <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 38.19.</P>
<P><HI>Further,</HI> It is evident, all delays of Repentance roll down hither, however Men propo&s;e a &s;top; yet hither the generality come at la&s;t: So that in effect, it is all one, whether Men are di&s;&s;waded from tru&s;t|ing to a Dying Repentance, or from delaying their Repentance. For if they are given to delay; It comes to this, They repent and die together. But if a Man be afraid to venture Eternity upon his la&s;t Breath, he will repent pre&s;ently.</P>
<P N="2">2. For the difficulty of being &s;incere in Repen|tance, I place it here, becau&s;e, though every Man &s;hould by drawing the parallel lines of Delu&s;ion, and mi&s;take upon him&s;elf, try his Repentance when ever it is; yet the&s;e Errors fall in greate&s;t numbers upon that point of Extremity, and with lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of rectifying them: But &s;eeing there are at all times &s;uch deceits in this Ca&s;e, there is nothing &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, as to repent in a clear light, and full lei&s;ure.</P>
<P N="3">3. For the &s;everity of God in denying his Grace, though I acknowledge his Indignation condemns many, who have dallied with him and their own Souls to be &s;uck'd in again by the whir-pool of their Lu&s;ts, when they would have ri&s;en out of them; yet this Indignation is never &s;o certainly at the height, as when Men have provoked it as long as they could: It is mo&s;t mi&s;erable therefore to make our la&s;t motions within the command of &s;uch a hor|rible
<PB N="88" REF="150"> Pit, le&s;t they prove only the &s;truggles of &s;ink|ing Men: yet this we mu&s;t do, if we are not before got out of it.

<P><HI>Objection</HI> 6. This Doctrin does not &s;avor enough of the Grace of the Go&s;pel, that would have all Men come to Repentance.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To di&s;cour&s;e the Severities of the Go&s;pel, to the ends of the Go&s;pel, is mo&s;t Evangelical Di&s;|cour&s;e. For as the Go&s;pel doth with all clearne&s;s declare its own Rigors, that Men might not mi&s;take it, for a loo&s;e and carele&s;s Doctrin, and &s;o mi&s;s the Salvation of it; &s;o have I di&s;covered the great ha|zard of a Dying Repentance, that Living Men might be per&s;waded not to ca&s;t them&s;elves upon it, and Dying Men excited to an Action &s;uitable to the ex|tremity of their Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>And this is indeed preaching the Go&s;pel; and to be moved <HI>upon it with fear, to prepare an Ark to the &s;aving our Souls</HI> before the flood come,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.7.</NOTE> is as true an effect of Faith, <HI>as to be con&s;trained by love to live to him,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 5.14.</NOTE> <HI>that hath</HI> died for us.

For the Prudence of Faith makes us apprehen&s;ive of the Rea&s;ons of Danger, and &s;o to Fear, even as the Gratitude of it ties us with the Obligations of Love. This is not that Fear that Love ca&s;ts out, but that it &s;elf quickens,

<P><HI>Infer.</HI> 1. But &s;etting a&s;ide the whole danger of a <HI>Death-Bed Repentance,</HI> Let me now la&s;tly thus rea&s;on, and thus expo&s;tulate; Why &s;hould we de|&s;ire to Repent &s;o late? It is good to be betimes do|ing that which is mo&s;t comporting with our true&s;t Happine&s;s; Reconciliation with God, return to Him, his Favour, to obey Him; the&s;e are the true&s;t Free|dom and Peace of a Man at all times: <HI>Great Peace have they which love thy Law, and nothing &s;hall offend them.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 119.165.</NOTE> He lives in the lea&s;t pain, that lives holie&s;t; <HI>I made ha&s;te therefore and delayed not to keep thy Commandments;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;al. 119.60.</NOTE> I &s;eized upon &s;o great an Enjoyment, as &s;oon as I could, afraid to be kept off from it too long.</P>
<P><HI>To fear God and keep his Commandments is the whole duty of Man,</HI> Eccle&s;. 12.13. When a Man
<PB N="90" REF="151"> con&s;iders Life, and that he hath but a Moment of it, and that therefore he would live that Moment, as much as may be he; &s;hall find the highe&s;t of Life, the top of Life to be <HI>Godline&s;s, which hath all the promi|&s;es of this life, and of that which is to come,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.8.</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue this World, and the Vanities of it is not only with greate&s;t folly, and impertinency to lanch our &s;elves in a great Ve&s;&s;el, the Greatne&s;s of our Affection; and with &s;olemn Preparations, our &s;tronge&s;t Action, into the low water, the &s;hallow of Life; which becau&s;e it cannot carry &s;o great a bulk, increa&s;es the Toyl and Vexation, as well as enhan&s;es the Vanity and Folly of doing nothing at &s;o great an expen&s;e: But wor&s;e than this, it is the loading our &s;elves with guilt under a delu&s;ion of Plea&s;ure; that gives us &s;ecret di&s;quiet and torment, while we are laying it on; and cannot be laid down as we plea&s;e; but with more &s;en&s;ible and indu&s;trious Angui&s;h, than we heap'd it upon us, I mean, the &s;en&s;e of our mi&s;|doings, and Contrition for them, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary <HI>to work Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>To conclude, Seeing <HI>to die is the end of all Men,</HI> Eccle&s;. 7.2. Repentance is to be cho&s;en while we live, that we may die with the greate&s;t quiet; with|out tho&s;e Agonies of Con&s;cience, tho&s;e cold Sweats, tho&s;e &s;inking Eyes, and fainting Spirits; for he dies with mo&s;t ea&s;e, that mo&s;t &s;urveys Death, and looks into all the Retirements of it before-hand; that knows it perfectly, and all its &s;trength; &s;uch an one governs him&s;elf in it, as in a mo&s;t important Action with Decency and Freedom. He is not hal'd by Death, but received by it: <HI>Into thy hands I commend my &s;pirit;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 23.46.</NOTE> he
<PB N="91" REF="151"> lays him&s;elf orderly into the &s;hade of Death: Where|as &s;o long adherence to the Plea&s;ures of Sin gives Death a Violence. It makes Men both unwilling, and afraid to die. <HI>This night thy Soul &s;hall be required.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 12.20.</NOTE> Life is exacted of a Sen&s;uali&s;t, and torn from him, that is re&s;igned by a Spiritual and Mortified Man; Good Men die in an active Sen&s;e, they know how to die; others die pa&s;&s;ively, they are forced to die.</P>
<P>This great difference prefers to us Dying daily, before that forcible Dying at once.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of Dying was accounted by Heathens one of the worthy Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es and Imployments of Life, and that required much &s;tudy. Chri&s;tianity gives us the true Rules of it, and they lie <HI>in waiting till our change come; Time is &s;hort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 7.29.</NOTE> <HI>they therefore that u&s;e</HI> this World, &s;hould not u&s;e it down to the Bran, &s;en&s;ually; but only take the advantages of it to a higher Life: El&s;e being met on the &s;udden by Death, they are like tho&s;e that fall off from Life with Violence, that is, Headlong; but they that live in the Sen&s;e of God, and an Eternal Condition, alight with care and ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is therefore not only greate&s;t Safety, but true&s;t Frugality and Improvement of Life to Repent be|times; and when we come to die, the ea&s;ie&s;t and &s;weete&s;t way of dying. Not indeed a Dying, but a Tran&s;lation into Immortality and Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
