<P>After this the Cardinall of <HI>Didrech&s;tein,</HI> who is owner of the towne of <HI>Niclaesburgh,</HI> waiting vpon the Empre&s;&s;e and the young Prince&s;&s;e thither to the Emperour, they all within two daies after and vpon the two and twentieth of May, returned to <HI>Vienna.</HI> Vpon the way towards <HI>Vienna,</HI> the Tur|ki&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador hauing beene purpo&s;ely &s;ent for to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and threatned that if he came not home the &s;ooner, he &s;hould but come time enough to be &s;trangled: making now ha&s;te home|wards, went to &s;ee the Emperour, and to view his per&s;onage throughly and well, that &s;o he might vpon his owne knowledge and eie-&s;ight report it, that the Emperour was yet aliue: for that not on|ly the Turkes about <HI>Offen</HI> and <HI>Buda</HI> in Hungaria, did verily beleeue that he was dead, but the ru|mor was al&s;o gotten as farre as <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed for currant in the great Turkes Court; as the <HI>Chiaux</HI> or me&s;&s;enger which came from thence to fetch home the Emba&s;&s;ador, affirmed it.</P>

<P>Vpon the Emperours comming home to <HI>Vien|na,</HI> the States of <HI>Austria</HI> being &s;till at their Diet or Land-day, it was concluded, that Emba&s;&s;a|dors &s;hould forthwith be di&s;patcht to the Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> to know his re&s;olution, whether hee would be willing (vpon &s;uch termes as we haue before &s;pecified) to di&s;engage the land of <HI>Enns:</HI> till when the Garri&s;ons of the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> lie &s;till in the &s;euen townes of <HI>Enns,</HI> which vex the in|habitants mightily, who haue beene compelled to pay 30000.

<P>And for the Dyet in <HI>Hungary</HI> it is hitherto put off, for that the Subiects would accept of no Deputie from the Emperour; whereupon was the Pallatine of <HI>Hungary</HI> him&s;elfe and diuers o|ther Lords faine to come to the Emperour, to certifie him &s;o much. So confident hath the gene|rall feare of <HI>Bethlem Gabors</HI> neerene&s;&s;e made them; that they now thinke it their be&s;t time to vrge the Emperour to confirme their priuiledges, when he hath &s;o &s;udden need of their &s;eruice.

And although our Generall would willingly &s;pare the Subiects of the Landgraue, yet can he not keepe the Souldiers from flying out. There are yet &s;ixe Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foote together, to come to ioyne with our Ar|my, out of <HI>Franconia</HI> (or <HI>Franckenland</HI>) and vntill we heare of the enemies &s;tirring, we haue no certain|ty of our owne ri&s;ing.</P>

<P>On the other &s;ide, they begin al&s;o to talke of going into the field, and of having a Leager about Emme|rick or <HI>Rees.</HI> And that for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hath already &s;ent great &s;tore of Ship-brid|ges, Ordnance, &amp; Munition that way. For out of the Ar&s;enall of the towne of <HI>Delft</HI> is all the Ordnance &amp; Artillery taken and &s;hipt away; certain pieces of Ar|tillery haue lately beene ca&s;t and tryed at the Hage, and being found good, are likewi&s;e &s;hipped away; &s;o as &s;omething is daily expected. Some new levies are al&s;o a making: one Captain <HI>Gent,</HI> (who commands a troope of hor&s;e) is named to haue gotten commi&s;&s;i|on from the Marque&s;&s;e of Brandenburgh, to levie 4000. foote, and 600. hor&s;e, in his Countryes.</P>
<P>Something hath al&s;o beene already done. The hor&s;emen of the States ranging abroad a while, haue, fetcht from before the gates of the towne of Rure|mond
<PB N="21" REF="7"> in Brabant (which belongs to the enemy) 400 head of cattell: All which the owners afterward redeemed, pay|ing 4. Rix dollars for euery Bea&s;t. After that againe, &s;ome other hor&s;men of the States lying abroad about the town of Ma&s;trich, met with certain Carts laden with merchants goods comming out of Brabant, which they made prize of, and carried the Carters along with them, to driue the Carts. As for their Sea-bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; they write vs word from Am&s;terdam; that 60 Turki&s;h men of warre of <HI>Argier</HI> &amp; <HI>Thunis,</HI> were lately come in and ioined with their fleet, which went out vnder Admirall <HI>L'Hermite,</HI> and that they had bin &s;eene together vpon the coa&s;t of Spaine. Of Ano|ther Fleere of Hollanders al&s;o, which was &s;ent towardes the red &s;ea, they had tydings out of Spaine, at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Iune 9. how that they meeting with foure great Caracks of Portugall, they made them run a-ground, where they peri&s;hed: This ill newes (&s;ay the Letters) cau&s;eth much griefe here, for they had rather haue &s;eene the rich hulkes brought home into Holland, then heare that they were peri&s;hed. More al&s;o they write off that they of Zealand haue lately taken another Ship laden with &s;ugars, Sallet-oyles, &amp; other Commodities, which they haue brought with them into Flu&s;hing.</P>
<P>For the Gri&s;ons bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, thus they write from Venice Iune 2. The Duke of <HI>Fiano</HI> who is the Popes generall for the Valtoline, hath &s;ent Poa&s;t vnto Rome, to entreate his brother the Pope, that the Earledome of Cleue in the Gri&s;ons country, which belongeth likewi&s;e vnto the Val|toline: might be al&s;o con&s;igned ouer into his hands, with the re&s;t of the country. I his Poa&s;t is now returned from Rome and the Duke who hath hitherto bin at Millaine, is now marcht towards <HI>Como</HI> (the neere&s;t part of the Dut|chy of Millaine vnto the Valtoline, <HI>Lago di Como,</HI> being clo&s;e by it) but he does not (as they &s;ay) entend to Mu&s;ter
<PB N="22" REF="8"> his Forces, vntill his Lieutenant the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Bagri</HI> be come vp to him from Rome. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Valtoline which they lately &s;ent to Rome, to obteine the confirmation of their Priviledges from the Pope, are returned with content: and one of them (the Knight <HI>Ro|bu&s;telli</HI> is made chiefe Iu&s;tice in the Valtoline. The Com|monaltie of Valtoline, are (it &s;eemes) de&s;irous to be a free Canton, Bundt, or Confederation by them&s;elues for euer hereafter; and not to haue any more to doe with the re&s;t of the Gri&s;ons; vnto whom for their preten&s;ions and de|mands, they are contented to giue 6000. Crownes yeare|ly as an acknowledgement.</P>
<P>The Spani&s;h Amba&s;&s;adour Signeur <HI>Ca&s;&s;aty,</HI> who hath laine in Switzerland, is now gone to the generall meeting of the Cantons of Switzerland at <HI>Solothurn;</HI> to worke that conclu&s;ion to be againe confirmed, which was made by the Catholiques at Lucerne; which was, that they would not make any new League with <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The French King in the meane time, earne&s;tly vrgeth the re&s;titution of the Valtoline. And &s;ome beleeue, that Count <HI>Mansfeild</HI> is by his appointment to march vp through Lorrayne and Burgundye, in ca&s;e that it bee not delivered at the time appointed.</P>

<HEAD>From Con&s;tantinople Aprill <HI>19.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Turkes and Polanders notwith&s;tanding the peace, doe &s;till make inroades one vpon another. The Co&s;acks haue lately pillaged &s;ome places of the Turkes lying vp|on the blacke Sea. The Muskovite Amba&s;&s;adour was therefore arre&s;ted at the gates of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> for that the Emperour his Ma&s;ter, had given the&s;e Co&s;acks and Polanders leaue, to pa&s;&s;e over the River of Bori&s;thenes, which is in his Country.</P>
