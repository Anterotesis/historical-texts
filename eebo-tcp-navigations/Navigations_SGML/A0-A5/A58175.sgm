been much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the Com|piling

&s;o great intere&s;t in it, that
it's but equal I &s;hould pre&s;ent

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen I had Travelled
over the greate&s;t part
of <HI>England</HI> in &s;earch
of Plants, and &s;uf|ficiently
informed
my &s;elf what &s;orts
my own Countrey naturally pro|duced;
I grew de&s;irous to &s;ee what
Varieties Foreign Countries of a dif|ferent
Soil and Temperature of Air
might afford. For which rea&s;on I
was ea&s;ily induced to accompany
<HI>Francis Willughby</HI> E&s;quire, <HI>Philip Skip|pon</HI>
E&s;quire and <HI>Nathanael Bacon</HI> Gent.
in a Voyage beyond the Seas. The
&s;ucce&s;s whereof, as to the number
of Plants found, exceeding my ex|pectation
(notwith&s;tanding the &s;hort|ne&s;s
of our &s;tay in mo&s;t places gave
<PB REF="6">
me not leave to make an exact &s;cru|tiny)
I thought it might not be a|mi&s;s
for the &s;atisfaction of the curi|ous,
and direction of tho&s;e who may
heerafter travel the &s;ame places with
like de&s;ign, to publi&s;h a Catalogue
of all not native of <HI>England</HI> that I
had ob&s;erved. But con&s;idering the
paucity of tho&s;e who delight in &s;tu|dies
and enquiries of this nature, to
advantage the Catalogue I have ad|ded
thereto a brief Narrative of our
whole Voyage, with &s;ome <HI>Ob&s;ervati|ons
Topographical, Moral and Natural,</HI>
made by my &s;elf and the foremen|tioned
Gentlemen. I &s;hall &s;ay no|thing
to recommend them, but only
that what I write as of mine own
knowledge is punctually and in all
circum&s;tances true, at lea&s;t accord|ing
to my apprehen&s;ion and judg|ment,
I not giving my &s;elf that li|berty
which many Travellers are wont
to take, and the common Proverb
&s;eems to allow them. And for what
I write from the Relation of
<PB REF="6">
others, though I will not warrant it
for certain, yet to me it &s;eemed mo&s;t
likely and probable. What Birds,
Bea&s;ts, Fi&s;hes and In&s;ects I ob&s;erved
abroad, whether common to us in
<HI>England,</HI> or peculiar to other Coun|tries,
I have forborn to &s;et down, be|cau&s;e
the taking notice and de&s;cri|bing
of them was the particular de|&s;ign
and bu&s;ine&s;s of that excellent
per&s;on Mr. <HI>Francis Willughby</HI> lately
decea&s;ed; and he having prepared &s;tore
of materials for a <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Animals,</HI>
and likewi&s;e dige&s;ted them into a con|venient
method, that work (if God
grant lei&s;ure and ability to bring it to
due perfection) is intended to be made
public, and the Reader may there find
what is heer omitted.</P>
<P>I might have been more large
concerning <HI>France</HI> but that we were
fru&s;trated in our de&s;ign of making
<HI>Grand tour</HI> (as they there call it) being
driven out thence by the <HI>Fr. Kings</HI>
Declaration, commanding all the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to withdraw them&s;elves and
<PB REF="7">
their effects out of his Dominions
within two months time. And yet
that Country being near us, much
travelled by and well known to tho&s;e
of our Nation, and there being many
Itineraries and De&s;criptions of it ex|tant
in Print, I thought it le&s;s needful
to write much concerning it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Spain,</HI> it being a Countrey
out of the ordinary road of Travel|lers,
and tho&s;e that have viewed it
gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ng others little encouragement to
follow their example, but rather con|demning
them&s;elves for their curio&s;i|ty,
as having found nothing there
which might an&s;wer their trouble
and expence, that the Reader may
know &s;omething of it without the
hazard and charge of travelling it, I
have added by way of <HI>Appendix</HI> a &s;hort
account of Mr. <HI>Francis Willughby</HI>'s
Voyage through a great part of it,
collected out of his notes; which had
he him&s;elf publi&s;hed he would doubt|le&s;s
have enriched with more Ob&s;erva|tions,
and cloathed with better Lan|guage.</P>
<P><PB REF="7">
Now whereas in the <HI>Narrative,</HI>
di&s;cour&s;ing concerning the petrifica|tion
of Shells, Fi&s;h-bones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I
have delivered as my opinion or con|jecture,
that tho&s;e bodies, which are
commonly known in <HI>England</HI> by the
names of <HI>Star-Stones</HI> and <HI>S. Cutberts
Beads,</HI> were nothing el&s;e but the &s;pines
and tail-bones of &s;ome Fi&s;hes, I mu&s;t
own my &s;elf to have been therein mi|&s;taken.
For my learned and ingeni|ous
Friend Mr. <HI>Martin Li&s;ter</HI> hath
lately advi&s;ed me, that he hath found
of them ramo&s;e and branched like
trees: which doth &s;ufficiently evince
they were not of that original I &s;up|po&s;ed.
Wherefore unle&s;s we will grant
them to be primary and immediate
productions of Nature, as they are
in the form of &s;tones; we mu&s;t em|brace
Mr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s opinion, that they
were the roots of &s;ome Plants;
though I confe&s;s I never as yet &s;aw any
Roots or Branches &s;haped and joynted
in that manner. Po&s;&s;ibly there may
be or have been &s;uch kind of &s;ubma|rine
<PB REF="8">
Plants or Roots which have hi|therto
e&s;caped my knowledge. For
that the parts not only of Trees but al|&s;o
of Herbs them&s;elves may &s;ome|times
petrifie, the &s;talks of <HI>Equi&s;etum</HI>
which we gathered up on the banks
of the River <HI>Tanaro</HI> in <HI>Piemont</HI> do a|bundantly
convince and &s;atisfie me.
And this is all that I thought needful
to acquaint the Reader with by way of
Preface.</P>

JOURNEY
Through
Part of the Low-Countries, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_April</HI> 18, 1663. We pa&s;&s;ed over in
the Packet-Boat from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>Ca|lais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Calais.</NOTE>
a Town formerly held by the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> about 210 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from
the 21. of King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third,
when it was taken, till the la&s;t year
of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> when it was lo&s;t. Since that time,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1596. it was taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under
Arch-Duke <HI>Albert</HI> in three days time, only the
Ca&s;tle held out &s;even or eight. And la&s;t of all, <HI>Anno</HI>
1598. it was re&s;tored to the <HI>French</HI> upon the Trea|ty
at <HI>Vervin,</HI> who now hold it. It is advantage|ou&s;ly
&s;ituate for Defence, and now very &s;trongly
fortified after the modern fa&s;hion with an impene|trable
Wall and Ba&s;tions of Earth, a deep Trench
full of Water to the landward, and a large Citadel.
The new Wall and Citadel were built about 44
years &s;ince. The old Stone-Wall and Ditch are &s;till
remaining, but enclo&s;ed within the new. The Town
for bigne&s;s exceeds <HI>Dover,</HI> and &s;eem'd to us frequent
and full of People. It hath a large &s;quare <HI>Piazza</HI>

deep enough to receive Ships of great Burthen.
The Buildings of the Town are not tall, but hand|&s;om

exactly level and &s;treight. And it is no wonder
they &s;hould be &s;o, the pre&s;ent Town having been
contrived and &s;et out all at once. For when it was
&s;urrendred up to Arch-Duke <HI>Albert</HI> after that famous
Siege of three years, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found nothing
there but great Heaps of Earth and Rubbi&s;h, &s;carce,
one Hou&s;e of the old Building remaining. This
Town is mo&s;t regularly and exactly fortified, &s;o that
it &s;eemed to us one of the &s;tronge&s;t Pieces in all the
<HI>Low-Countries.</HI></P>

drives to and keeps fa&s;t the foremo&s;t Gates, and
the Water in the enclo&s;ed &s;pace &s;inks till it be even

a large <HI>Axis</HI> deeply furrowed, from which it hangs
down into a Well of Water, and being turned about
by the <HI>Axis,</HI> the de&s;cending Buckets have their
mouths downward, and take up Water as they pa&s;s

This kind of Machin is generally u&s;ed in <HI>Italy,

<HI>John Tates,</HI> a Man of a Gigantick Stature, born at

fingers end to his elbow was 25 inches and a half, the
length of his hand to his wri&s;t 11 inches, his middle
finger 7 inches. He was well &s;haped, and all his
Limbs proportionable to his height. He was afterwards
(as we heard) brought over into <HI>England</HI> to be
&s;hown.</P>
<P>Near this City (as <HI>Boetius de Boot,</HI> who was Na|tive
thereof relates) digging ten or twenty Ells deep
in the Earth, they find whole Woods of Trees, in
which the Trunks, Boughs and Leaves do &s;o exact|ly
appear, that one may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;eve|ral
kinds of them, and very plainly di&s;cern the Se|ries
of Leaves which have fallen yearly. The&s;e &s;ub|terraneous
Woods are found in tho&s;e places which
500 years ago were Sea, and afterwards either left
and thrown up by the Sea, or gained from it, the
Tides being kept off by Walls and Fences. But be|fore
the fore-mentioned term of 500 years, there
is no memory that the&s;e places were part of the
Continent. And yet &s;eeing the tops of the&s;e Trees
do for the mo&s;t part lie Ea&s;tward, becau&s;e (as is pro|bable)
they were thrown down by We&s;tern Winds,
which on this Coa&s;t are mo&s;t boi&s;terous and violent,
it will nece&s;&s;arily follow that in the mo&s;t antient
times and before all memory of man, the&s;e places
were Firm Land, and without the limits of the
Sea.</P>
<P>The De&s;criber of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> tells us, that in
<HI>Frie&s;fland</HI> and <HI>Groningland,</HI> there are great numbers
of the&s;e under-ground Trees found and digged up
in Mo&s;&s;es and fenny Grounds where they dig for
Turves. In <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">gland</HI> al&s;o there are found of them
plentifully in many places, the Wood whereof
<PB N="7" REF="13" MS="y">
they u&s;ually call <HI>Mo&s;s-Wood,</HI> becau&s;e it is for the
mo&s;t part digged up in the Mo&s;&s;es or moori&s;h boggy
Fens and Levels where they get Turves; though
&s;ometimes it be found in firmer Grounds, and &s;ome|times
in the &s;ides of Mountains. The Que&s;tion is,
How the&s;e Trees came to be buried &s;o deep under
ground? To which we may probably an&s;wer, that
many Ages ago before all Records of Antiquity, yea
before primitive Fame or Tradition it&s;elf, the&s;e
places were part of the firm Land, and covered
with Wood; afterwards being undermined and
overwhelmed by the violence of the Sea, they con|tinued
&s;o long under water, till the Rivers brought
down Earth and Mud enough to cover the Trees,
fill up the&s;e Shallows, and re&s;tore them to the firm
Land again. In like manner upon the Coa&s;t of
<HI>Suffolk</HI> about <HI>Dunwich,</HI> the Sea doth now and hath
for many years pa&s;t very much encroached upon the
Land, undermining and overwhelming by degrees
a great deal of high ground; in&s;omuch that anti|ent
Writings make mention of a Wood a mile and
half to the Ea&s;t of <HI>Dunwich,</HI> which is at pre&s;ent &s;o
far within the Sea. Now if in &s;ucceeding Ages (as
likely enough it is) the Sea &s;hall by degrees be filled
up, either by its own working, or by Earth brought
down by Land-Floods &s;till &s;ub&s;iding to the bottom,
and growing up over the tops of the&s;e Trees, and &s;o
this &s;pace again added to the firm Land; the men that
&s;hall then live in tho&s;e parts (if the World &s;o long la&s;t)
will, it's likely, dig up the&s;e Trees, and as much won|der
how they came there, as we do at the pre&s;ent
Mo&s;s-Wood.</P>
<P>And now that I am &s;peaking of filling up and
atterrating (to borrow that word of the <HI>Italians</HI>) the
Skirts and Borders of the Sea, I &s;hall take leave to
add by the by, that to me it &s;eems very probable,
that all the <HI>Low-Countries</HI> have been in this manner
gained from the Sea. For <HI>Varenius</HI> in his Geography
<PB N="8" REF="14">
tells us, That &s;inking Well in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> at near
an hundred foot depth they met with a Bed or Floor
of Sand and Cockle-&s;hells, whence it is evident that
of old time the bottom of the Sea lay &s;o deep, and
that that hundred foot thickne&s;s of Faith above the
Sand aro&s;e from the Sediments of the Waters of
tho&s;e great Rivers, which there emptied them&s;elves
into the Sea, and in times of Floods brought down
with them abundance of Earth from the upper
Grounds: Which yet is a &s;trange thing, con&s;ider|ing
the novity of the World, the Age whereof ac|cording
to the u&s;ual Account is not yet 5600 years.
That the Rain doth continually wa&s;h down Earth
from the Mountains, and atterrate or add part of
the Sea to the firm Land, is manife&s;t from the <HI>La|gune</HI>
or Flats about <HI>Venice;</HI> the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">amdrg</HI> or I&s;le of the
River <HI>Rho&s;ue</HI> about <HI>Aix</HI> in <HI>Provence,</HI> in which we
were told that the Watch-Tower had in the memory
of &s;ome men been removed forward three times, &s;o
much had been there gained from the Sea; and many
places in our own Land: only it is a received Traditi|on,
and may perhaps be true, that what the Sea lo&s;es in
one place, it gets in another. That the height of the
Mountains, at lea&s;t tho&s;e which con&s;i&s;t not of firm
rocks, doth continually dimini&s;h, is I think very likely,
not to &s;ay certain. I have been credibly informed, that
whereas the Steeple of <HI>Craich</HI> in the <HI>Peak of Derby|&s;hire</HI>
in the memory of &s;ome old men yet living
could not have been &s;een from a certain Hill lying
between <HI>Hopton</HI> and <HI>Wirksworth,</HI> now not only
the Steeple, but a great part of the Body of the
Church may from thence be &s;een: Which without
doubt comes to pa&s;s by the &s;inking of a Hill between
the Church and place of View. Hence it would fol|low,
that in proce&s;s, of time (but it would be many
thou&s;ands of years fir&s;t) all the Hills and Mountains
(except the rocky) would by Floods and Shots of
Rain be quite wa&s;hed away and the whole Earth le|velled.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="14">
But to return to the Trees: One material Excep|tion
again&s;t our Solution &s;till remains, and that is,
that a great many of the&s;e &s;ubterraneous Trees dig'd
up in <HI>England</HI> are thought to be Firs, whereas that
kind of Tree doth not at pre&s;ent, and con&s;equently
we have rea&s;on to believe never did, grow wild
in this Kingdom. To which I an&s;wer, that this
Exception would indeed much puzzle me, were
it certain and manife&s;t, that this is Fir-Wood,
which is &s;o generally reputed from its Grain, In|flammability
and other Qualities. But &s;ince it doth
not clearly appear to me &s;o to be, I &s;hall re|&s;pite
my An&s;wer, till I be fully &s;atisfied concerning
it.</P>

The &s;everal Faculties are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their
Habits: Divinity-Students wear con&s;tantly Gowns
and &s;quare Caps; tho&s;e of other Faculties wear
none, except at their publick Exerci&s;es in the Schools.
The principal Colleges, called <HI>Pedagogies,</HI> are four.
In the&s;e only is Philo&s;ophy taught by two Profe&s;|&s;ors,
the one called <HI>Primarius,</HI> the other <HI>Secunda|rius.</HI>
Tho&s;e Students that are Gentlemen &s;it in a
higher Form, called <HI>Scamnum Nobilium;</HI> and give
each of them &s;ix Gilders quarterly to the <HI>Primarius</HI>
Profe&s;&s;or, and two Patacoons to the <HI>Secundarius.</HI>
Tho&s;e of in&s;eriour rank who &s;it in the lower Forms
give half &s;o much to each. The <HI>Primarius</HI> reads in
the morning from half an hour after &s;ix of the clock
till half an hour after &s;even, then they go to Ma&s;s
till eight, and after that to their private Studies
till ten, then the Profe&s;&s;or reads again till eleven.
In the afternoon the <HI>Secundarius</HI> Profe&s;&s;or reads
from half an hour after one, till half an hour after
two. He begins again half an hour after four and
reads till half an hour after five. All Students mu&s;t
write after the Profe&s;&s;ors in a large Note-Book, and
in the intervals of Lectures peru&s;e and &s;tudy what
they wrote. The Profe&s;&s;ors Readings are divided into
<HI>Dictata,</HI> which are The&s;es or Propo&s;itions, and <HI>An|notata</HI>
which are Solutions of Objections. The fir&s;t
thing they require of Students when they come to this
Univer&s;ity is to be matriculated, and &s;wear their Be|lief
of all the Doctrines of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church. The
Clo&s;e or End of the Oath is the &s;ame with that of
our Univer&s;ities, <HI>Ita me Deus adjuvet &amp; haec &s;ancta Dei
Evangelia.</HI></P>
<P>Young Students give their Names to the Pre&s;i|dent
of their College or Pedagogy, and for every
time they are ab&s;ent from Lectures are puni&s;hed
a Stiver, which is &s;omewhat more than a Penny
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For every time they mi&s;s a publick
Exerci&s;e in Law or Phy&s;ick they pay three Sti|vers;
<PB N="18" REF="19">
if they be to exerci&s;e them&s;elves and mi&s;s,
they are mulcted twenty Stivers. The Students
are not allowed to wear Swords about the
Streets.</P>
<P>The Profe&s;&s;ors of each Pedagogy chu&s;e yearly 12
of the be&s;t Scholars who are of two years &s;tand|ing.
The&s;e 48 are publickly examined, and out of
them about 12 u&s;ually cho&s;en to Bur&s;es or Exhibi|tions.
The Bur&s;es &s;ignifie their Diet, Chamber
and a greater or le&s;s Stipend according as the Bur|&s;es
are. It is very creditable to be cho&s;en to a
Bur&s;e. He that is the fir&s;t of the cho&s;en hath a
Bell rung for him in his College 48 hours together
without intermi&s;&s;ion. When they are thus cho&s;en,
they may go into what College they will and &s;tudy
what they plea&s;e. They are commonly preferred
to Profe&s;&s;or&s;hips and afterwards to Canons Places.
The Degrees here conferred are <HI>Batchelour,</HI> Licen|tiate
and <HI>Doctor.</HI> In <HI>Divinity</HI> after two years &s;tand|ing
they may be <HI>Baccalaurei ourrentes,</HI> after another
year <HI>Baccalaurei formati.</HI> Seven years after this
they may be <HI>Licentiates</HI> in Divinity. They are
&s;eldom created <HI>Doctors</HI> till they attain to 50 years of
Age, unle&s;s they be very eminent for Learning.
Every <HI>Batchelor</HI> is called <HI>Docti&s;&s;imus: A Licentiate</HI> in
Medicine <HI>Periti&s;&s;imus,</HI> in Law <HI>Con&s;ulti&s;&s;imus,</HI> in Di|vinity
<HI>Eximius: Doctors</HI> of Medicine and Law are
<HI>Clari&s;&s;imi,</HI> of Divinity <HI>Eximii</HI> Domini &amp; <HI>Magi&s;tri no&s;tri.</HI>
When any one goes out <HI>Licentiate,</HI> there is a Treat|ment
made, to which all the Doctors and the Oppo|nents
are invited, and have Gloves given them. The
Graduate is attended from the Schools with Drums
and Trumpets. At his Lodging a Bell is hung up
and rung for 24 hours together. He hath liberty to
chu&s;e a Coat of Arms, and is immediately reputed a
Gentleman.</P>

<P>From <HI>Lovain, May</HI> 5. we travelled to <HI>Mechlin,

Ditch of water of a very great depth and breadth,
excepting on that &s;ide the River <HI>Scheld</HI> wa&s;hes it.

Brick, &s;ome few wooden ones of the antient Build|ing
here and there remaining, which the Owners
are not &s;uffered to repair. The Chappel of the
<HI>Je&s;uites</HI> College is very rich and &s;umptuous. The

carved, that the Emperour <HI>Charles V.</HI> (as we were
told) was wont to &s;ay, that it de&s;erved to be kept
in a ca&s;e and &s;hewn only upon Holy-days. The

a Square of le&s;s than an Acre of Ground,
but well &s;tored with Plants, of which there have
been at &s;undry times &s;everal Catalogues printed.

our Univer&s;ities, (excepting two of the nature of

the Town, where they can be&s;t provide them&s;elves.
No Schola&s;tical Habits as Gowns or Caps worn by
any of the Students, but they walk up and down,
come to the Schools, and perform their Exerci&s;es
in Cloaks. The Profe&s;&s;ors when they read Lectures
or pre&s;ide at Di&s;putations wear Gowns. No cap|ping
Profe&s;&s;ors or Univer&s;ity-Officers in the publick
Schools, but all the Students are covered both at
Lectures and Di&s;putations, not only in the Uni|ver&s;ity,
but in all the Univer&s;ities we have been at
beyond the Seas. If an de&s;ire to be admitted of
the Univer&s;ity, they go to the <HI>Rector magnificus,</HI> who
gives them each a Seal, and then they are freed
from paying Exei&s;e. The Students u&s;ually li&s;t
them&s;elves under &s;ome Profe&s;&s;or, who reads to
them in private, running through a whole Faculty,
which they call <HI>Collegium in&s;tituere,</HI> and for this they
give a Gratuity to the Profe&s;&s;or. In conferring
Degrees here is no Re&s;pect had to Standing.
When any one intends to commence in any Faculty,
he makes <HI>The&s;es</HI> upon the Subject he intends to an|&s;wer,
which <HI>The&s;es</HI> are printed, and the&s;e he is obli|ged
to defend again&s;t all Opponents. The Re&s;pon|dent
hath his Seat under the Pro&s;e&s;&s;ors, as in our
Schools: for the Opponents there is no particular
Seat, but in any part of the Schools where they
happen to be, they ari&s;e and there &s;tand and oppo&s;e,
fir&s;t asking leave of the Profe&s;&s;or that pre&s;ides at
the Act. Any one that plea&s;es may oppo&s;e with
the Profe&s;&s;ors leave. <HI>Liberalium Artium Magi&s;ter</HI>
and Doctor are the only Degrees conferred here.
Each of the Profe&s;&s;ors have 200 or 300 <HI>l. per an.</HI>
stipend allowed them by the States.</P>
<P>The chief Trade of this City is Clothing. The
Roof&s; of the Hou&s;es are more &s;teep than ordi|nary,

<P>Before we left <HI>Leyden</HI> we made a by-Journey to
<HI>Sevenhuys,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven|huys.</NOTE> a Village about four leagues di&s;tant, to
&s;ee a remarkable Grove, where in time of year &s;e|veral
&s;orts of Wild-Fowl build and breed. We ob|&s;erved
there in great numbers (1.) <HI>Scholfers</HI> i. e.
<HI>Gracculi palmipedes,</HI> in <HI>England</HI> we call them <HI>Shags,</HI>
they are very like to Cormorants, only le&s;s. We
were much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee them, being a whole-footed
Bird, alight and build upon Trees. (2.) <HI>Le|pelaers,</HI>
called by <HI>Ge&s;ner Plateoe &s;ive Pelecani,</HI> by <HI>Al|drovandus
Albardeolae,</HI> we may term them in <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Spoon-Bills. (3.) <HI>Quacks</HI> or <HI>Ardeae cinereae
minores,</HI> the <HI>Germans</HI> call this Bird the <HI>Night-raven,</HI>
becau&s;e it makes a noi&s;e in the Night, <HI>Nocte cla|mat
voce ab&s;on&acirc; &amp; tanquam vomiturientis.</HI> Ge&s;ner.
(4.) <HI>Reyers</HI> or Herons. Each &s;ort of Fowl hath its
&s;everal Quarter. When the young are ripe, they
who farm the Grove with an Iron Hook fa&s;tned to
the end of a long Pole lay hold on the Bough on
which the Ne&s;t is built, aud &s;hake the young ones
out, and &s;ometimes Ne&s;t and all down to the ground.
Be&s;ides the fore-mentioned Birds there build al&s;o in
this Wood <HI>Ravens, Wood-Pigeons</HI> and <HI>Turtle-Doves.</HI>
This place is rented for 3000 Gilders <HI>per Annum</HI> of
the Baron of <HI>Pelemberg,</HI> who lives at <HI>Lovain,</HI> only
for the Birds and Gra&s;s. By the way to this Place
we ob&s;erved in the Ditches <HI>Ly&s;imachia lutea flore glo|bo&s;o,</HI>
and <HI>Arum &s;ive Dracunculus aquaticus.</HI> All the
Countrey about <HI>Sevenhuys</HI> towards <HI>Leyden</HI> is a flat
or fenny Level, full of &s;hallow Pools of Water;
there we ob&s;erved their manner of making Turf.
They rake or fi&s;h up Mud from the bottom of the
Water with a Net like a Hoop-Net fa&s;tned to the
end of a Pole, and fill therewith a flat-bottomed
Boat. Out of the Boat they throw this Mud with
<PB N="39" REF="29">
a long Shovel or Scoop on an even piece of ground,
making of it a Bed of an equal thickne&s;s &s;o near as
they can; there it lies to drain and dry: After a
while they tread it with broad Boards fa&s;tned under
their feet to make it clo&s;e and &s;mooth. When it
is moderately dry, they cut the whole Bed with a
kind of Spade into pieces of the bigne&s;s of a Brick.
The&s;e they pile up in &s;mall conical Stacks or long
Ranks, laying the Turves &s;o, that a man may &s;ee
through the Stacks, and the Wind blow through
them, to be further dried. At la&s;t they hou&s;e them
in Barns that are thatcht, the &s;ides not walled up
clo&s;e, but made of wooden Bars &s;et at a little di&s;tance
one from another.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 6. we took Boat for <HI>Haerlem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Haerlem.</NOTE> where we
arrived at four hours end. This is a large, popu|lous
and plea&s;ant City, &s;trongly wall'd and entren|ched.
Water is brought through many of the
Streets. Without the Walls towards <HI>Leyden</HI> are
plea&s;ant Groves. In the Summer-Hou&s;e in the
Garden of the Princes Court here, is a Picture of
<HI>Laurentius Co&s;terus,</HI> in a furr'd Gown, holding the

<P>His Statue and the In&s;cription on his Hou&s;e in
the Market-place, mentioned by <HI>Hegenitius,</HI> we
could not find, being as we were told, lately bought
and removed thence. The Butchery of this Town
is a hand&s;ome Building and covered with Lead,
which we thought not unworthy the notice-taking,
it having been the fir&s;t publick Building that we &s;aw

<P><HI>June</HI> 8. From <HI>Haerlem</HI> we boated to <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Am&s;ter|dam.</NOTE>
two hours di&s;tant.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> About the mid-way we pa&s;&s;ed
by two great Mears where we changed our Boat.
At the Port of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;tand two armed Sol|diers,
one within, the other without. This is the
greate&s;t City in all the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> and one of
the riche&s;t and be&s;t traded Empories of the whole
World. At our being there we judged it to be
about the bigne&s;s of <HI>Venice,</HI> and le&s;&s;er than one half
of <HI>London;</HI> but they had then taken in and enclo|&s;ed
with a &s;ub&s;tantial Wall and Trench, a great
&s;pace of Ground, wherein they had de&s;igned and
&s;et out Streets, with intention to make their City
for bigne&s;s al&s;o comparable with the be&s;t of <HI>Europe,
London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> not excepted. I hear &s;ince, that
this void Ground is filled with Rows of &s;tately and
beautiful Hou&s;es. The publick Buildings we e&s;pe|cially
took notice of were, (1.) The <HI>New Stadthou&s;e</HI>
lately erected, the old one having been burnt down
to the Ground in three hours &s;pace (as we were
told) <HI>June</HI> 7, 1651. but (as I find it in the Printed
De&s;cription of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>) in <HI>July</HI> 1652. This is
a magnificent Pile of Building, of a &s;quare figure,
large and tall. The Out&s;ide or Facing of the Walls
round about is of Free-Stone, the body of the
Walls of Brick. It is reported, that the Foundati|on
of this Structure under ground co&s;t as much as
the <HI>Superficies</HI> above ground, <HI>viz.</HI> 100000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;terling.
The De&s;criber of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;aith, that it &s;tandeth
upon 13659 great Ma&s;ts or Piles driven into the
ground. (2.) The <HI>Bur&s;e</HI> or <HI>Exchange,</HI> like our old
Royal Exchange at <HI>London,</HI> but not a perfect Square,
being longer than it is broad. The fir&s;t Stone of
<PB N="41" REF="30">

Merchants of all Nations re&s;ort thither, but of all
Strangers the <HI>Jews</HI> are the mo&s;t numerous, who

Building with fair Rooms. (4.) The <HI>Maga|zine,</HI>
and (5.) the &s;everal <HI>Ho&s;pitals</HI> and Hou&s;es of
Correction. In this City is an <HI>Athenaeum</HI> or <HI>Schola
illu&s;tris,</HI> in which are maintain'd &s;ix Profe&s;&s;ors,
who read publick Lectures in &s;everal Faculties in
Summer-time. Here is al&s;o a publick <HI>Phy&s;ick-Garden.</HI>
The <HI>Jews</HI> are here allowed the free and open Exer|ci&s;e
of their Religious Wor&s;hip. They live together
in one Quarter of the City, and are &s;aid to be in
number about 20000 &s;ouls. They are in better
condition and richer than in mo&s;t places where they
are tolerated. They are for the mo&s;t part of a dark
or tawny Complexion and have black hair. Not
only the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> but all other Religions, the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>
not excepted, are here tolerated. But if any be&s;ide
tho&s;e of the State-Religion build Churches, they
are prohibited to erect Steeples, or make u&s;e of
Bells for the a&s;&s;embling of the Pople. In the new

two out of the &s;even that were cho&s;en the la&s;t year;

is a&s;&s;embled upon important occa&s;ions by the
Burgoma&s;ters for their Advice and Direction in
the weighty Affairs and Concerns of the City.
The Supreme Power &s;eems chiefly to re&s;t in

<P>Formerly none was capable of being <HI>Burgoma&s;ter</HI>
except his Father had been a Freeman a year and
&s;ix weeks before he was born; but of late they
have made a Con&s;titution, that he who will pay
five hundred Gilders, may be made free of the
City, and capable of being Burgoma&s;ter after &s;even
years. Any one may be made a Freeman for fifty
<PB N="44" REF="32">
Gilders, but then he &s;hall never be capable of being
cho&s;en <HI>Burgoma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The De&s;criber of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;aith that there were
in that City 18 years ago 54000 Hou&s;es, whereas
in <HI>Paris</HI> there were then but 46000, which is a
thing by no means to be credited.</P>
<P>The Militia of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of 54 Compa|nies
divided into five Regiments, each containing
eleven Companies, and every Company con&s;i&s;ting

Two Companies watch every night for the guard
of the City.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 16. we took Boat for <HI>Vtrecht,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vtrecht.</NOTE> where we
arrived at &s;ix hours end. This is a great Town
and the head of a Province, environed with a thick

and Buildings far &s;hort of the Elegancy, Beauty
and Cleanline&s;s of tho&s;e in <HI>Holland;</HI> much like the
Hou&s;es and Streets of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Towns. Water
runs through many of the Streets in deep Chanels.
The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathedral Church hath a great tall
Tower, a&s;cended by 460 Steps, from whence we
had a fair Pro&s;pect of the City and Countrey round
about. Here is an Univer&s;ity erected by the States

<P>The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of eight Companies of
Soldiers, whereof one was <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Govern|ment
is by an upper and under <HI>Scout,</HI> and four Bur|goma&s;ters,
whereof two new cho&s;en yearly.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 18. we went by Boat to <HI>Vianen,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vianen.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ing
over a Branch of the River <HI>Rhene</HI> called the <HI>Lech.</HI>
This is a privileged Town, wall'd and trench'd
about, &s;ubject to the Lord of <HI>Brederode.</HI> Here we
noted an Engine or wheel for the weaving of Inkle
and Tape, which moves many Shuttles at once.
The &s;ame day we travelled on to <HI>Leerdam,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Leerdam</NOTE> three
hours di&s;tant from <HI>Vianen,</HI> a &s;mall incon&s;iderable
Town, belonging to the Prince of <HI>Orange.</HI></P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 19. we pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>A&s;peren</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A&s;peren.</NOTE> a &s;mall
wall'd Town, and further on ferried over the River
<PB N="48" REF="34">
<HI>Wale (Vahalis</HI> in <HI>Latine</HI>) to a pretty plea&s;ant wall'd
Town called <HI>Bommel</HI> &s;tanding in an I&s;land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bommel.</NOTE></P>
<P>Here lay in Garri&s;on four Companies of Soldiers,
whereof one of <HI>Scotchmen.</HI></P>
<P>Not far from hence we ferried over the <HI>Mo&s;e,</HI> and
pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;trong Fort nigh the Water called <HI>Creve|coeur,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Creve|coeur.</NOTE>
and not much further another called <HI>Engelen,</HI>
and after four hours came to the <HI>Bo&s;ch,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bo&s;ch.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Hertogen|bo&s;ch</HI>
the Dutch call it, and the French <HI>Bois le duc,</HI>
i. e. <HI>Sylva Ducis.</HI> Before we entred the Town, we
pa&s;&s;ed through a Water and over two Draw Brid|ges.
This Place is &s;ituate on a Hill in the mid&s;t of
a low fenny Level of a great extent, the greate&s;t
part whereof is (at lea&s;t now was) covered with
Water, &s;o that the only Avenues to the Town are
upon artificial Cau&s;ways. It is encompa&s;&s;ed with
a &s;trong Wall and a deep Trench. At one end
&s;tands a Citadel &s;trongly fortified, which commands
the Town. By rea&s;on of its Situation and Fortifi|cations,
one would judge this Place impregnable,
yet hath it been taken in the late Wars. At our
being there were kept in Garri&s;on for the Defence
of this important Strength 21 Companies of Foot
and four Troops of Hor&s;e. In the Quire of S. <HI>Johns</HI>
Church are painted the Arms of many of the Knights
of the Golden Fleece and over the upper Stalls or
Seats this written in <HI>French, Le treshaut &amp; tres pui&s;|&s;ant</HI>
Philip, <HI>dit le bon, &amp;c.</HI> which becau&s;e it con|tains
the Hi&s;tory of the Authors fir&s;t In&s;titution
and Model of this Order, I thought fit to tran&s;late
into <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and here &s;et down. <Q>The mo&s;t High
and Mighty prince <HI>Philip</HI> called the Good, by the
Grace of God Duke of <HI>Burgundy, Lorain</HI> and <HI>Bra|bant,</HI>
in the year 1429. in the City of <HI>Bruges,</HI>
did in imitation of <HI>Gedeon</HI> create and in&s;titute to
the Honour of God and the virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and
for the &s;ake of <HI>S. Andrew</HI> Protector and Patron of
<HI>Burgundy,</HI> a Company or Society of Honourable
<PB N="49" REF="34">
Knights, into which might be received Emperors,
Kings, Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es and other Per&s;onages,
as well of his own Subjects as of forein Countries,
provided they were of Noble bloud and good fame:
and called the&s;e great Per&s;ons, <HI>Knights of the Golden
Fleece,</HI> to whom he gave for perpetual Chief, him
that &s;hould be lawful Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> and have
the Seigneury or Lord&s;hip of the <HI>Low-Countries;</HI> li|miting
their number to 24, comprehending al&s;o the
Chief. And for occurrences and u&s;e of the Order
he created four Honourable Officers, <HI>viz.</HI> A Chan|cellor,
a Trea&s;urer, a Secretary, and a King of
Arms. And for the E&s;tabli&s;hment and well regu|lating
of this Order he made notable Statutes and
Ordinances</Q>. The Hou&s;es of this Town are of a
different make from tho&s;e of <HI>Holland,</HI> the out&s;ide
being covered with Boards, like tho&s;e of <HI>Eden|burgh</HI>
in <HI>Scotland.</HI> We ob&s;erved great &s;tore of wild
Fowl to frequent the Waters hereabout; and found
growing wild <HI>Herniaria hir&s;uta</HI> on the &s;andy and
gravelly Banks.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 20. We took a Wagon drawn by three
Hor&s;es abrea&s;t, as is u&s;ual in the&s;e Countries, which
in &s;ix hours time brought us to <HI>Eindhoven,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eindho|ven.</NOTE> a &s;mall
wall'd Town; and thence in four hours more to <HI>Haumont.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hau|mont.</NOTE> a pitiful walled Town belonging to the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Liege. June</HI> 21. Three hours Riding
brought us to another little wall'd Town called <HI>Bry;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bry.</NOTE>
the Hou&s;es whereof were old and decaying. Be|tween
<HI>Haumont</HI> and this place, we rode over Heaths
of great extent, called the <HI>Champagne.</HI> We then
left the level Countrey and a&s;cended &s;ome Hills,
from whence we had a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect of the
<HI>Mo&s;e</HI> and <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mae|&s;tricht.</NOTE> where we arrived this Evening,
though it be accounted &s;even hours di&s;tant from
<HI>Bry.</HI> This City is fortified with good Outworks,
be&s;ides a &s;trong Wall and Trench, garri&s;oned with
31 Companies of Foot, and &s;ix Troops of Hor&s;e,
<PB N="50" REF="35">
it being a great Town and a Frontier. Half of the
Magi&s;trates are Prote&s;tants and half of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI>
Religion. The greater part of the Citizens <HI>Ro|mani&s;ts.</HI>
There are in Town near 20 Cloi&s;ters or
Mona&s;teries of both Sexes; and they have the free
and publick Exerci&s;e of their Religious Wor&s;hip.
For the Prote&s;tants there are three <HI>Dutch</HI> Churches,
and one <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> which tho&s;e Nations
u&s;e alternately. The old Buildings of his City are
like tho&s;e of the <HI>Bo&s;ch;</HI> but &s;ince the States have
been Ma&s;ters of it, it is become a rich and thriving
place, and they are building fair new brickt Hou&s;es
space. They were al&s;o &s;etting up a large Stone
Stadthou&s;e, of a &s;quare Figure, re&s;embling that at
<HI>Ame&s;terdam.</HI> The River <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> divides the City into
two parts, which are joined together by a broad
&s;tone-Bridge of nine Arches. The le&s;&s;er part over the
Water is called, <HI>Wick.</HI> The Garri&s;on-Soldiers are
all Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>The Common People of <HI>Holland,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Man|ners and particular Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Low-Dutch.</HI></NOTE> e&s;pecially Inn|keepers,
Wagoners (Foremen they call them) Boat|men
and Porters are &s;urly and uncivil. The Wa|goners
bait them&s;elves and their Hor&s;es four or five
times in a days Journey. Generally the <HI>Dutch</HI> men
and women are almo&s;t always eating as they travel,
whether it be by Boat, Coach or Wagon. The men
are for the mo&s;t part big-boned are gro&s;s-bodied.
The fir&s;t Di&s;h at Ordinaries and Entertainments is
u&s;ually a Salade, <HI>Sla</HI> they call it, of which they eat
abundance in <HI>Holland.</HI> Their Meat they commonly
&s;tew and make <HI>Hotchpots</HI> of it. Puddings neither
here nor in any place we have travelled beyond Sea
do they eat any, either not knowing the goodness
of the Di&s;h, or not having the Skill to make them:
<HI>Puddings</HI> and <HI>Brawm</HI> are Di&s;hes proper to <HI>England.</HI>
Boil'd Spinage minc'd and buttered (&s;ometimes al&s;o
with Currans added) is a great Di&s;h all over the&s;e
Countreys. The Common People feed much upon
<PB N="51" REF="35">
<HI>Cabiliau</HI> (that is Cod-fi&s;h) and pickled Herrings,
which they know how to cure or prepare better than
we do in <HI>England.</HI> You &s;hall &s;eldome fail of hung
Beef in any Inn you come into, which they cut into
thin &s;lices and eat with Bread and Butter, laying
the &s;lices upon the Butter. They have four or five
&s;orts of Chee&s;e, three they u&s;ually bring forth and
&s;et before you. (1.) Tho&s;e great round Chee&s;es,
coloured red on the out&s;ide, commonly in <HI>England</HI>
called <HI>Holland</HI>-Chee&s;es. (2.) Cummin-&s;eed Chee&s;e.
(3.) Green Chee&s;e, &s;aid to be &s;o coloured with the
juice of Sheeps Dung. This they &s;crape upon Bread
buttered, and &s;o eat. (4.) Sometimes <HI>Angelot's.</HI>
(5.) Chee&s;e like to our common Countrey Chee&s;e.
Milk is the cheape&s;t of all Belly-Provi&s;ions. Their
&s;trong Beer, (thick Beer they call it, and well they
may) is &s;old for three Stivers the Quart, which is
more than three pence <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> All manner of Vi|ctuals
both Meat and Drink are very dear, not for
the Scarcity of &s;uch Commodities, but partly by
rea&s;on of the great Exci&s;e and Impo&s;t wherewith they
are charged, partly by rea&s;on of the abundance of
Money that is &s;tirring here. By the way we may
note, that the dearne&s;s of this &s;ort of Provi&s;ions
is an argument of the Riches of a Town or Coun|trey,
the&s;e things being always cheape&s;t in the poor|e&s;t
places. Land is al&s;o here &s;old at 30 or 40 years
Purcha&s;e, and yet both Hou&s;es and Land &s;et at very
high annual Rents: So that were not the poor
Workmen and Labourers well paid for their pains,
they could not po&s;&s;ibly live. Their Beds are for the
mo&s;t part like Cabbins, inconveniently &s;hort and
narrow, and yet &s;uch as they are, you pay in &s;ome
places ten Stivers a night the man for them, and in
mo&s;t &s;ix. There is no way for a Stranger to deal
with Inn-keepers, Wagoners, Porters and Boat|men,
but by bargaining with them before-hand.
Their Hou&s;es in <HI>Holland</HI> are kept clean with extra|ordinary
<PB N="52" REF="36">
ordinary nicene&s;s; and the Entrance before the
Door curiou&s;ly paved with Stone. All things both
within and without, Floor, Po&s;ts, Walls, Gla&s;s,
Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff marvellou&s;ly clean, bright, and hand|&s;omly
kept: nay &s;ome are &s;o extraordinarily cu|rious
as to take down the very Tiles of their Pent|hou&s;es
and clean&s;e them. Yet about the preparing
and dre&s;&s;ing of their Victuals our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;wives
are, I think, more cleanly and curious than they.
So that no wonder <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> were formerly noted
for exce&s;&s;ive eating, they having greater temptation
to eat, both from the goodne&s;s of their Meat, and the
curio&s;ity of the dre&s;&s;ing it, than other nations.</P>
<P>In the principal Churches of <HI>Holland</HI> are Organs,
which u&s;ually play for &s;ome time after the Sermon is
done. The Collections for the Poor are made in Ser|mon-time,
a Pur&s;e with a Bell hanging at the bottom
of it and fa&s;tned to the end of a Pole being by the
Collector reach'd to every one. The P&s;alm to be &s;ung
is marked upon Slates, which are hung up and down
the Churches. The People of the&s;e Countreys buy and
&s;ell &s;mall Commodities, and travel by Wagon or Boat
upon the Lords Days. Their travelling Wagons are
&s;ome covered and &s;ome open: few travel on Hor&s;e|back.
No Beggars to be &s;een in all <HI>Holland,</HI> care
being taken to &s;et on work all that are able, and
Provi&s;ion made for the aged and impotent. There
are in this one Province of <HI>Holland</HI> three or four
and twenty walled Towns and Cities, and &s;ix of
the&s;e at lea&s;t, be&s;ide <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> bigger than any
we have in <HI>England</HI> except <HI>London;</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>
by this time well approaches to the Bigne&s;s of
<HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e I &s;hall add &s;ome Ob&s;ervations concern|ing
the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> made by my much honoured
Friend <HI>Francis Barnham</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> decea&s;ed, at his being

other things of a &s;urpri&s;ing nature, which we

<P>All Differences ari&s;ing between Skippers and Fore|men,

<P><HI>June</HI> 22. we travelled from <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> to <HI>Liege</HI>
four Leagues di&s;tant. In the &s;ide of a Hill we a|&s;cended
at &s;ome di&s;tance from <HI>Mae&s;tricht,</HI> we &s;aw
an arched Pa&s;&s;age into a Vault (as we were inform|ed)
&s;ome two hours in length. A good way within
under ground they dig Stone which here they bring
out in Carts. It being a wet &s;ea&s;on we made no
&s;tay to go into this Vault, therefore I have added
here the De&s;cription of it out of the <HI>Philo&s;ophical
Tran&s;actions</HI> Numb. 67. pag. 2051.</P>
<P>There is an excellent Quarry within Cannon-&s;hot
of <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> upon the very brink of the River
<HI>Ma&s;e,</HI> lying in a Hill, where there are about 25
Fathoms of Rock and Earth over head; the length
of the Hill being of &s;ome miles extending along the
River towards <HI>Liege,</HI> &s;ituate on the &s;ame River;
and towards <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> having in breadth &s;ome half
or quarter of a mile, but &s;omewhat more further
off. This Quarry hath one Entry towards the Ri|ver,
where Carts can pa&s;s with great ca&s;e, and un|load
the Stones upon the brink of the River, the
Quarry within lying parallel to the Horizon or
Level, (which is a great advantage) and elevated
but very little above the River. This &s;ame Quarry
which hath well nigh undermined the whole Hill,
affords one of the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing Pro&s;pects, when
<PB N="57" REF="38">
well lighted with many Torches, that one can ima|gine.
For there are thou&s;ands of &s;quare Pillars in
large level Walks, and tho&s;e almo&s;t every where
above twenty, and in &s;ome places many more foot
high, and all wrought with &s;o much neatne&s;s and
regularity, that one would think it had been made
rather with curious Workman&s;hip for an under|ground
Palace, than that tho&s;e Pillars and Galle|ries
were made by Quarriers that did it only for
getting Stone to build above ground. This Quarry
&s;erveth the People that live thereabouts for a kind of
impregnable Retreat when Armies march that way.
For being acquainted with all the ways in it, they
carry into it what&s;oever they would have &s;afe, as
well their Hor&s;e and Cattel as their moveable Fur|niture,
till the danger be over, there being &s;o va&s;t
a deal of room, that 40000 people may &s;helter
them&s;elves in it. And he that &s;hould attempt to
&s;eek them out in this va&s;t Wilderne&s;s of Walks and
Pillars, without an expert Guide, would not only
be in hazard of lo&s;ing his way, but of being knockt
on the head at the corner of every Pillar, where
People lurking in the dark with their Carbines and
Fowling-Pieces would have fair opportunity of
&s;hooting at them by the Light of their own Tor|ches,
<HI>&amp;c. vide.</HI></P>
<P>Further upon the Downs we &s;aw three or four
more of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ages, and from hence had again
a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect of <HI>Mae&s;tricht</HI> and the Coun|trey
about the River <HI>Mo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Liege</HI> or <HI>Luyck</HI> is a large City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liege.</NOTE> but not comparable
to the <HI>Holland</HI> Towns for Beauty or Riches; built
for the mo&s;t part of Timber; &s;ome of the Hou&s;es
being covered with boards after the <HI>Scotch</HI> fa&s;hion,
and &s;ome with Slate [the Walls I mean,] the re&s;t
uncovered and of Clay. The Streets are neither
broad not clean-kept. The River <HI>Mo&s;e</HI> here divides
it&s;elf, and runs through the Town in two or three
<PB N="58" REF="39">
Branches, over which are &s;everal Bridges. Here
is a convenient Key, and upon the River we ob|&s;erved
Boats of an extraordinary length, the like
whereto we had before &s;een at <HI>Vtrecht</HI> and <HI>Dort.</HI>
This City is plea&s;antly &s;ituate and environed almo&s;t
round with Hills. On the Brow of a Hill which
hangs over it, &s;tands a Fort or Castle which com|mands
it. Upon the &s;ides of the&s;e Hills are abun|dance
of Orchards and Cherry-Gardens: On tho&s;e
near the City we fir&s;t &s;aw Vineyards; though there
are near <HI>Lovain,</HI> which we &s;aw not. All Belly-Provi&s;ions
are cheap here. A great many of Poor
and Beggars you meet with at every corner, but
they are not importunate if denied. The Coun|trey
People are civil, well-manner'd and kind
to Strangers. The Women are of a dusky Com|plexion,
and generally not &s;o hand&s;om as the <HI>Hol|landers.</HI>
They do a great deal of Drudgery, the
poorer &s;ort carrying Coals and other Burthens on
their backs in Baskets of a Conical Figure, to the
end or bottom of which they apply a &s;tiff Ba&s;ton,
and &s;o re&s;t them&s;elves without &s;etting down their
Burthens. Near this City are gotten Coals in great
plenty, but they lie very deep under ground; &s;ome
of us went down into a Pit 150 yards deep. The
Coal are like our Stone-Coal. The arts they u&s;e

the&s;e Delfs &s;ee in the <HI>Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Luyck</HI> they u&s;e al&s;o for Fewel a &s;ort of round
Balls made of Clay mixed with a certain proportion
of Coal, beaten &s;mall, tempered together, and dri|ed
in the Sun, which they call <HI>Hot&s;hots.</HI> The&s;e we
never &s;aw u&s;ed any where but here, though the
making of them is de&s;cribed in many Books. They
&s;erve to &s;lake the Heat of the Fire, and keep the
Coals from burning out too fa&s;t. Here and at <HI>Na|mur</HI>
(as we were told) are made Stone-Pots and
Jugs. The Cathedral Church is dedicated to S. <HI>Lam|bert,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="39">
to which belong 60 <HI>Canonici majores,</HI> who
mu&s;t be all of Noble Blood, except &s;ome few Scho|lars
which they may chu&s;e in. By the&s;e the Bi&s;hop

them. In the Garden of the <HI>Engli&s;h Je&s;uites</HI> Col|lege

a plea&s;ant little walled Town, though called a

in the Summer-time repair thither in great numbers
to drink the Medicinal Waters. There is one Well

only of one &s;hort broad Street, nor for its Beauty,
the Buildings being all of Wood. The Garri&s;on at

we entred the Town we were met upon the way by
&s;ome of the&s;e Soldiers, who very in&s;olently &s;topt
our Hor&s;es, demanding Money of us, which we
were forced to give according to their di&s;cretion,
before they would let us pa&s;s, which though it were
no con&s;iderable Sum, yet was more than we were
willing &s;hould be violently extorted from us. When

them dies, the re&s;t chu&s;e another in his place. The
Senators are cho&s;en by the &s;everal Companies, of
which there are about fourteen or fifteen in this

Heat. So then the actual Heat of the&s;e Springs
proceeds from the Mixture and Encounter of their
Waters (impregnate as is before intimated) with
the Mineral and Metallic Sub&s;tances, Juices and
Spirits conteined in the Veins of the Earth through
which they have their Cour&s;e. The nitrous Salt
fore-mentioned may perhaps be the <HI>Hermetic</HI> Salt
of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rochas,</HI> or the <HI>e&s;urine</HI> Salt of <HI>Helmont.</HI>
Now the Water once heated, being conteined in
the Vaults of the Mountains as in a Stove, continues
hot a long time, the Eruption thereof being, it is
<PB N="65" REF="42">
likely, at a good di&s;tance from the place where it
did at fir&s;t conceive its Heat.</P>
<P>At the long continuance and duration of the Heat
of the&s;e Waters for &s;o many ages pa&s;t no man need
wonder: For (1.) It is generally taken for granted
that all &s;orts of Mines do grow and increa&s;e by
addition, converting the more refined, &s;ubtile part
of the Earth, and which hath a &s;eminal di&s;po&s;ition
of &s;uch a change, into their own nature. (2.) The
nitrous Salts, the fir&s;t Ingredients of the&s;e Waters,
are al&s;o re&s;tored in their <HI>Matrices,</HI> after the &s;ame
manner as we &s;ee it happens in the <HI>Caput mortuum</HI>
of Vitriol, which though the Vitriol hath been once
or twice extracted from it, will by being expo&s;ed
to the Air again recover more; whether it be by
conver&s;ion of its <HI>Matrix</HI> into its own nature by a kind
of Aggeneration and Tran&s;mutation, or by imbi|bing
and retaining tho&s;e &s;ubtile and volatile &s;aline
Exhalations, which continually a&s;cend out of the
Earth or wander up and down the Air.</P>
<P>As for the Ingredients of the&s;e hot Waters in ge|neral
he &s;aith, That be&s;ides a threefold Salt-Nitre
<HI>fixed, volatile</HI> and <HI>mingled</HI> or <HI>Armoniack,</HI> they par|take
of a fixed and volatile <HI>Sulphur,</HI> a <HI>Manna</HI> of
Alum, &s;ome Vitriol, divers Metals, as Copper and
Iron, a very little volatile Earth, a certain <HI>Argilla,</HI>
Sand and Calaminary Flowers. That they parti|cipate
of Copper he proves in that the Territory of
<HI>Aken</HI> abounds in divers places with <HI>Lapis Calami|naris,</HI>
which is as it were the Aliment of Copper:
For being mingled in the Furnaces with red Copper
it augments it by the addition of 30 pound weight
<HI>per Cent.</HI> and gives it a yellow or golden Tincture.
As for Iron, the many ferrugineous Springs that are
found within and without this City are an evident
te&s;timony that there are plenty of Iron Mines here|about;
and therefore mo&s;t likely it is, if not cer|tain,
that the&s;e hot Waters charge them&s;elves with
<PB N="66" REF="43">
that Metal. That they contain a threefold nitrous Salt,
he proves from their natural Evaporations. (1.) The
fixed is found in the Wells of <HI>Borcet</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI>
cry&s;tallized into &s;mall &s;hining &s;quare grains, ming|led
with a little Flower of Sulphur, &s;ticking to the
Covers of tho&s;e Wells, which have not been of a
long time opened. It may be al&s;o found in the
Chymical examination of the&s;e Waters by Evapora|tion
or De&s;tillation. (2.) The <HI>Volatile</HI> is carried up
by the volatile Sulphur, as is hereafter &s;hew'd in the
De&s;cription of the fir&s;t &s;ort of the&s;e Baths. (3.) The
<HI>mingled</HI> or <HI>Armoniac</HI> is daily &s;een in all the Waters
of the City and of <HI>Borcet,</HI> &s;wimming in little Cy|linders
on the &s;urface of the Water, and this is that
Cream or Scum which is ordinarily found upon
the Waters in the Ba&s;ins. That they contain the
re&s;t of the fore-mentioned Ingredients &s;hall be
&s;hewn in the De&s;cription of the particular Baths:
the Waters whereof our Author reduces to four &s;orts.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Nitro-&s;ulphureous,</HI> &s;uch are tho&s;e of the <HI>Em|perors</HI>
Bath, the <HI>Little</HI> Bath, and S. <HI>Quirin</HI>'s Bath.
2. <HI>Sulphureo-nitrous,</HI> &s;uch are tho&s;e of <HI>Compus</HI> or
the <HI>Poor-mens</HI> Bath, the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI>-Bath and S <HI>Cornelius</HI>
his Bath. 3. <HI>Sulphureo-nitro-vitriolic,</HI> &s;uch is ano|ther
Bath of the &s;ame S. <HI>Cornelius.</HI> 4. <HI>Sal&s;o-alumino|nitrous,
viz.</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Borcet</HI> a Village adjoining to
<HI>Aken.</HI></P>
<P>I. As for the <HI>Nitro-&s;ulphureous</HI> kind, tho&s;e of the
<HI>Emperors</HI> Bath and the <HI>Little</HI> Bath are but one Wa|ter
coming from the &s;ame Source, and collected in
one and the &s;ame Well. That part re&s;erved in the
<HI>Emperors</HI> Bath is divided into five great Ba&s;ins or
Receptacles: that in the <HI>Little</HI> Bath into three.
All which might be renewed daily, if time would
permit, the Spring is &s;o copious. But by rea&s;on of
the exce&s;&s;ive Heat of the Waters, it is nece&s;&s;ary oft-times
that they &s;tand in the Ba&s;in 16 or 18 hours to
cool, before they be fit for the Patients u&s;e. Not|with&s;tanding
<PB N="67" REF="43">
when they are come to a ju&s;t temper,
one may bath in them and endure them a long time,
as tho&s;e of <HI>Borcet,</HI> without any Inconvenience. This
Source hath that of peculiar to it&s;elf, that in its
Well one may find di&s;tinctly a quantity of <HI>Nitre</HI>
coagulated, and good plenty of Flowers of <HI>Sulphur</HI>
very light, purely fine and well &s;ented. The <HI>Nitre</HI>
&s;ticks to the &s;ides of the Well, and &s;o do the Flow|ers
of <HI>Sulphur</HI> above that: The which &s;ometimes
whether by the extraordinary boiling up of the
Fountain, or by the impetuo&s;ity of the a&s;cending
Vapours, or by their own weight are broken off,
and fall back into the Source; from whence being
no more di&s;&s;olved by the Water, they come forth
intire into the Ba&s;ins. If you take of this Water,
and let it &s;tand in a Ve&s;&s;el certain days, it will pre|cipitate
of the&s;e yellow Flowers of <HI>Sulphur</HI> to the
bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el. Be&s;ides the&s;e <HI>volatile</HI> Flow|ers,
the&s;e Waters contein al&s;o <HI>fixt</HI> Flowers of <HI>Sul|phur,</HI>
a competent quantity of <HI>Nitre</HI> and <HI>volatile,
fixt</HI> and <HI>mixt</HI> or <HI>Armoniac,</HI> a little <HI>Alum,</HI> le&s;s <HI>Vitriol,</HI>
the Spirits and Principles of <HI>Copper</HI> and <HI>Iron,</HI> a very
little volatile Earth, <HI>Argilla</HI> and Sand: no <HI>Bitumen,</HI>
for let them &s;tand as long as you plea&s;e, you &s;hall
find no fatty &s;ub&s;tance &s;wimming upon them as
upon the <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters. The volatile <HI>Sulphur</HI> eva|porates
&s;o &s;trongly that it carries up with it a quan|tity
of <HI>Nitre,</HI> as one may &s;ee after the &s;olution of
the Vapours congeled and frozen in Winter-time,
when it remains incorporated upon the Walls in
the places where the Iceicles were. The&s;e Waters
are in weight equal to tho&s;e of the <HI>Spaw;</HI> coming
fre&s;h out of the Source they appear whiti&s;h or blu|i&s;h,
but having &s;tood a while and grown cold,
greeni&s;h. They are very pure and leave no kind of
Mud or <HI>Lutum thermale</HI> behind them; in cooling
they yield a &s;mall Scum or Cream of Nitre. Far
from their Source, being wrought upon by the Air,
<PB N="68" REF="44">
they let fall a little whiti&s;h Sediment, as tho&s;e of
<HI>Bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">et</HI> do a blacki&s;h one. They pre&s;erve the colour
of Ro&s;es put into them and cau&s;e them not to wi|ther,
as doth common Water. The Vapours a&s;cen|ding
from them make Silver Plate black, as tho&s;e
of <HI>Boreet</HI> make it white. The other Source of
S. <HI>Quirin</HI>'s Bath differs from the&s;e in no other re|&s;pect,
&s;ave that the Water thereof is cooler. It is
re&s;erved in three Ba&s;ins. In this Well you find
neither <HI>Sulphur</HI> nor <HI>Salt-peter</HI> &s;ticking to the &s;ides,
probably becau&s;e it is open or uncovered.</P>
<P>II. The &s;econd or <HI>Sulphureo-nitrous</HI> &s;ort of <HI>Com|pus, &amp;c.</HI>
though they &s;pring up in &s;everal places
and have different Wells, yet is the Nature of them
all, their Compo&s;ition and Mineral Ingredients the
&s;ame. The <HI>Poor mens</HI> Bath hath one great Ba&s;in or
Receptacle, the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI> Bath four, whereof two only
are u&s;ed, and S. <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Bath of this Mine
two. The&s;e Waters are fit for u&s;e at all &s;ea|&s;ons,
being of a temperate Heat, more efficacious
and of greater force in their Operations than the
fir&s;t &s;ort; they weigh two <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than they,
and are of a &s;tronger Sent. In the&s;e is never found
any <HI>Sulphur</HI> conden&s;ed, no not in their Wells
though they be covered: but when they are em|ptied
and new Water let in (as in the <HI>Ro&s;e</HI>-Bath) the
Water running down along the Walls and Seats into
the bottom of the Ba&s;ins or Con&s;ervatories, the exter|nal
Air prevailing upon it &s;o &s;pread and in &s;uch little
quantity arre&s;ts, fixes and conden&s;es its <HI>Sulphur</HI> all
along the &s;aid Walls and Seats, refre&s;hing the eyes
of the Spectators with its Beauty and Lu&s;tre. But
the Water ari&s;ing in the fore-mentioned Ba&s;ins, and
covering the Seats and Walls, the Sulphur again
unites and incorporates with its Di&s;&s;olvent, and
di&s;appears and hides it&s;elf therein. The Water of
the&s;e Sources conteins great quantity of Sulphur
very fine and &s;weet, le&s;s nitrous Salt, a little Vitriol
<PB N="69" REF="44">
and le&s;s Alum, more of the other Minerals and Me|tals
than the fir&s;t &s;ort or tho&s;e of <HI>Borcet.</HI> So that
they are more compounded, oleous and bituminous
than any of the other Sources; and though they
come out of the Earth very temperate as to actual
Heat, yet can &s;ick per&s;ons hardly endure them for
any long time, for the mo&s;t part &s;carce half an
hour.</P>
<P>III. The third &s;ort which I call <HI>Sulphureo-nitro-vitriolic,</HI>
and is al&s;o of S. <HI>Cornclius,</HI> differs from the
precedent in that the Ta&s;t is a little more acid, the
Smell &s;weeter and liker that of Spirit of Vitriol,
and the Touch le&s;s oily. It is of le&s;s Efficacy in u&s;e
than the &s;econd &s;ort, and of more than the fir&s;t.
Of this Source there are three Ba&s;ins, which with
the two others of S. <HI>Cornelius</HI> before-mentioned
make five in this Hou&s;e. The&s;e Waters do agree
much what in their Compo&s;ition with the prece|dent.
They are very pure and clear, e&s;pecially
in their Wells; and though they &s;eem troubled
in their Ba&s;ins, yet taken in a Gla&s;s they appear
clear.</P>
<P>IV. The fourth or <HI>Sal&s;o-alumino-nitrous</HI> kind are
tho&s;e of the Neighbourhood or <HI>Borcet.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Borcet Baths.</NOTE> The&s;e
come out of the Earth extreme hot, and in great
abundance, are all of the &s;ame Medicinal Quality,
have &s;everal Wells, and are re&s;erved in ten or twelve
Hou&s;es, each whereof hath two Ba&s;ins or Recep|tacles,
be&s;ides which there is a common Bath expo|&s;ed
to the Air, for the u&s;e of poor people. The&s;e
Waters ca&s;t off a copious Excrement or Tartar,
which yet is not Stone, but only a Sand mingled
with and united to the nitrous and aluminous Salt
of the Water, coagulated by the beating of the
cold Air on its Superficies, to which al&s;o concurs
the cold of the Walls expo&s;ed to the &s;ame Air.
The&s;e Excre&s;cencies are found in the &s;ubterrancous
Conduits, not only of the&s;e but the other Baths in
<PB N="70" REF="45">
the City; being held to the Fire they &s;oon become
friable, and are nothing but a pure round Sand like
the common. The higher Hou&s;es and Ba&s;ins have
the more of this Tartar, yet is it &s;o little that it
is not to be &s;een or perceived in the Water. The&s;e
Waters are of a different <HI>Species,</HI> Virtue and Ope|ration
from tho&s;e of the City; are very ea&s;ie to
&s;uffer, and &s;erve often for Diverti&s;ement and Re|creation
to per&s;ons that are in health. The content
of them is a great quantity of Sea-Salt and Alum,
le&s;s nitrous Salt, a very little Sulphur and not much
of Metallic Sub&s;tances.</P>
<P>Concerning the Virtues and Effects of the&s;e
Waters inwardly taken, he di&s;cour&s;es to this pur|po&s;e:</P>
<P>The&s;e Waters taken inwardly are very available
again&s;t the Phthi&s;ic, <HI>A&s;thma</HI> or Difficulty of Breath|ing
occa&s;ioned by tough Phlegm lodging in the
branches of the Wind-Pipe; again&s;t the Weakne&s;s
of the Stomach, Indige&s;tion, Crudities, Flatulencies,
Vomitings, Hiccoughs and inveterate Colics. They
di&s;&s;ipate and dry up all manner of Catarrhs and &s;e|rous
De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">luxions; and are very proper to be drunk
by tho&s;e that are troubled with the Pal&s;ie, before
the u&s;e of the Baths. They quicken the Appetite,
clean&s;e the Blood and open the ob&s;tructions of the
Me&s;entery. They are of excellent u&s;e again&s;t Hy|pochondriacal
Maladies, e&s;pecially in &s;uch as have
weak and cold Stomachs. They mollifie the hard|ne&s;s
of the Liver, Spleen and Me&s;entery. They
di&s;&s;olve and bring away the Gravel of the Reins
and the le&s;&s;er Stones: And here he produces many
Examples of &s;uch as avoided Stones upon the
drinking the&s;e Waters, and among the re&s;t of &s;ome
that had drank the <HI>Spaw</HI> Waters, and came from
thence without reciving any Benefit. They clean&s;e
the Ulcers of the Bladder, di&s;&s;olving not only the
gro&s;s, phlegmatic and vi&s;cous Humours which co|agulate
<PB N="71" REF="45">
the Stone, but even the Stone it&s;elf whil&s;t it
is yet tender. They have &s;ometimes cured inter|mittent
Fevers of long continuance, and &s;crophulous
Tumors. They dry up and heal the Itch, Lepro&s;ie
and other Affections of the Skin. They &s;top the
immoderate Flowing of the <HI>Men&s;es</HI> in Women and
cure the Jaundi&s;e, the Palene&s;s and Di&s;colouring of
the Skin in Virgins: and finally they give ea&s;e and
relief in the Gout. Of all the&s;e Faculties he brings
In&s;tances and Examples in Per&s;ons that have been
cured. Particularly that the&s;e Waters drunk may
have a power of di&s;&s;olving the Stone, he proves by
this Experiment: Taking a Stone voided by a man
about two years before, and infu&s;ing it in Water hot
from the Fountain for the &s;pace of three days, we
found it (&s;aith he) mollified and reduced into a &s;oft
Phlegm. Which Virtue of the Waters was further
confirmed to us by a late Accident: for opening
the Vault of a Well there was found a certain Glue
or Mucilage, which it's to me probable, came from
the &s;olution of the Morter of Lime and Sand in
long time, by the volatile and di&s;&s;olvent Spirits of
the Waters; e&s;pecially there being found no other
Cement between the Stones, and in that this &s;ame
Glue or Mucilage mingled it&s;elf intirely with the
Waters of the Fountains without any appearance
of Scum or Fat &s;wimming on the top, &s;o as Gum
of Cherry or the like is wont to do in Water, and
being ca&s;t into the Fire burnt not, but dried up.
The&s;e Experiments and Ob&s;ervations were made
upon occa&s;ion of a Burgoma&s;ter of <HI>Riga</HI> (who being
afflicted with the Stone drank the&s;e Waters) his
pa&s;&s;ing his Urine through a Linen Cloth, and find|ing
therein a certain thick Phlegm left behind, which
being kept a while upon Paper hardned into a
&s;tony Sub&s;tance.</P>

Copper, about the bigne&s;s and of the figure of a &s;quare
Trencher, &s;tamped at the four Corners with the Kings
Image and Arms, of that weight, that if a man be
to receive ten or twenty pound in &s;uch Coin, he
mu&s;t come with a Cart and Team of Hor&s;e, to carry
it home. The Prince Palatines Name and Titles
are <HI>Carolus Ludovicus, Comes Palatinus Rheni, &s;acri
Romani Imperii Elector, utriu&s;&abque; Bavariae Dux.</HI> He
&s;peaks &s;ix Languages perfectly well, <HI>viz. High-Dutch,
Low-Dutch, Engli&s;h, French, Italian</HI> and <HI>Latine,</HI> is
greatly beloved of his Subjects of whom he hath
a paternal Care, and who&s;e Intere&s;t he makes his
own.</P>
<P>In the great Church where the famous Library
was kept, we ob&s;erved many fair Monuments of
Princes of this Family, &s;ome with <HI>Dutch,</HI> mo&s;t with
<HI>Latine</HI> Epitaphs or In&s;criptions: Others in the <HI>Fran|ci&s;cans</HI>
Church. In S. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church al&s;o a great
number of Monuments of learned men of the Uni|ver&s;ity;
which is of good account and one of the be&s;t
in <HI>Germany.</HI> Three or four Colleges there are built
and endowed chieflly for the maintenance and accom|modation
of poor Students.</P>
<P>The Government of this Univer&s;ity is by a Senate,
which con&s;i&s;ts only of 16 Profe&s;&s;ors. The number
<PB N="85" REF="52">
of Profe&s;&s;ors is limited, and their Stipends fixt by
the Statutes of the Univer&s;ity given them by their
Founder <HI>Rupertus</HI> Count Palatine <HI>Anno</HI> 1346. and
confirmed by the Pope and Emperor. Of the&s;e Pro|fe&s;&s;ors
three are of <HI>Divinity;</HI> four of <HI>Law;</HI> three of
<HI>Medicine,</HI> and &s;ix of <HI>Philo&s;ophy.</HI> Of the Philo&s;ophy
Profe&s;&s;ors four only are admitted into the Senate,
le&s;t they &s;hould make too great a party. Be&s;ides the
Senate chu&s;es anew the Philo&s;ophy Profe&s;&s;ors every
year, and may change them if they plea&s;e: the other
Profe&s;&s;ors are cho&s;en for term of life. When one
dies the Senate chu&s;es two and pre&s;ents them to the
Prince, of which he takes one to &s;ucceed in the va|cant
place. This Senate chu&s;es every year a <HI>Rector ma|gnificenti&s;&s;imus,</HI>
which is only an Honorary Title con|ferred
upon &s;ome Prince or great per&s;on, for he hath
no power at all in the Univer&s;ity. (2.) A <HI>Rector ma|gnifl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">us</HI>
out of their own number by major Vote, the
chief Officer for power and an&s;werable to our <HI>Vice-chancellour.</HI>
(3.) An <HI>Aedilis</HI> who takes care of the
public Buildings. (4.) A <HI>Praefectus rei vinariae.</HI> (5.) A
<HI>Praefectus rei frumentariae,</HI> which Officers an&s;wer to
our <HI>Taxers.</HI> (6.) A <HI>Quae&s;tor,</HI> who gathers up the
Univer&s;ity Revenue and Rents. Further this Senate
is a Juri&s;diction by them&s;elves, and have ab&s;olute
power in criminal Cau&s;es extending to Life and
Death: only after Sentence given the Prince may
pardon. The Degrees conferred here are in Philo|&s;ophy
<HI>Ma&s;ters,</HI> of which lately there have been but
few created; in Law and Medicine <HI>Licentiates</HI> and
<HI>Doctors;</HI> in Divinity <HI>Batchelors, Licentiates</HI> and <HI>Do|ctors,</HI>
of which la&s;t there have been but few lately.
They confer Degrees without any regard of Stand|ing.
The Candidate mu&s;t undergo a double <HI>Exa|men.</HI>

the <HI>Rector magnificus</HI> being pre&s;ent, and if he be found
un&s;ufficient he is remitted, and appointed a certain

<P>The Prince Elector is ab&s;olute in his own Terri|tory.
He can make Laws and repeal them, treat
with forein Princes, &s;ending Emba&s;&s;adors to them,
and receiving Emba&s;&s;adors from them, make War
and Peace, impo&s;e Tributes arbitrarily on his Sub|jects
without the con&s;ent of the States of the Coun|trey.
The Emperor hath nothing to do with his
Subjects, they &s;wearing Allegiance only to him.
He only can excommunicate, having re&s;erved to
him&s;elf the Epi&s;copal Power. The Prince Elector
hath &s;even Councils or Courts, (1.) <HI>Concilium Au|gu&s;tum</HI>
or his Privy Council. (2.) <HI>Concilium Stat&ucirc;s.</HI>
(3.) <HI>Concilium Eccle&s;ia&s;ticum,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of four, where|of
two are Lay men, and two Clergy. (4.) <HI>Dica|&s;terium,</HI>
who judge Cau&s;es between man and man.
(5.) <HI>Concilium feudale.</HI> (6.) <HI>Concilium redituum
temporalium</HI> or <HI>rationum.</HI> (7.) <HI>Concilium redituum
<PB N="92" REF="56">
Eccle&s;ia&s;ticorum.</HI> The Prince hath thought fit to keep
the&s;e two la&s;t di&s;tinct, partly that he may know how
to proportion the Mini&s;ters Allowance; and partly
that if any of his Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hould happen to change
his Religion (as is ordinary for Princes to do in <HI>Ger|many</HI>)
they may be able to di&s;tingui&s;h clearly be|tween
their own proper Temporal and the Church
Revenue.</P>
<P>The Prince in his own Territory is general Bi&s;hop
and &s;upreme Head in Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Affairs. Formerly
this Countrey was under the In&s;pection and Juri&s;|diction
of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Spier,</HI> but &s;ince the Refor|mation,
the Prince hath not only &s;eized the Reve|nues
of the Church into his own hand, but al&s;o a&s;|&s;umed
to him&s;elf entirely the Epi&s;copal Power and
Juri&s;diction. He al&s;o is univer&s;al Patron, and di&s;|po&s;es
of all vacant Benefices as he plea&s;es; indeed
the Council of four nominate and pre&s;ent two unto
him, of which u&s;ually he chu&s;es one, becau&s;e it may
well be pre&s;umed that he knows not &s;o well as they
what per&s;ons are be&s;t qualified and fit to be preferred;
but he is not obliged to confer the Benefice upon ei|ther
of the per&s;ons by them &s;o nominated, but may
either put in another known to him&s;elf, or com|mand
them to nominate others, if he like not tho&s;e
pre&s;ented. The Religion of the Countrey is the
Reformed. The whole Palatinate is divided into
three <HI>Praef&egrave;cturae,</HI> and &s;ome, <HI>viz.</HI> the greater of the&s;e
&s;ubdivided into le&s;s. Every <HI>Praefectura</HI> hath its In|&s;pector
or Bi&s;hop, who is Pa&s;tor of &s;ome Church in
that <HI>Praefectura:</HI> He differs not from any other in
any Juri&s;diction, but in that commonly he hath a
larger Stipend. His bu&s;ine&s;s is only to give Infor|mation,
if he be of a le&s;&s;er Divi&s;ion, to the In&s;pector
of the whole <HI>Praefectura</HI> under which he is, if of a
greater, to the Council of foar. If need be every
<HI>Praefectura</HI> or great Town hath a Presbytery. The
Presbytery of <HI>Heidelberg</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of the five Mini&s;ters
<PB N="93" REF="56">
of the City, two Deputies from each Juri&s;diction
except the <HI>Aulica:</HI> and two from each Quarter of
the City; &s;o that at this time the number in all is
21. The&s;e all have equal Suffrages the Lay-men
with the Mini&s;ters, only one of the Mini&s;ters always
pre&s;ides in his Cour&s;e. This Presbytery a&s;&s;embles
once every week, at who&s;e meeting is always pre|&s;ent
a Delegate from the Prince, to &s;ee that nothing
be agitated there which it concerns not the Presby|tery
to meddle withal. This Presbytery hath no
power to excommunicate or inflict any Church Cen|&s;ure;
but if any per&s;on be accu&s;ed to them of any
Crime, they &s;end him to the Juri&s;diction to whom
he appertains, to enquire into his Offence. The
Court having received this Information from the
Presbytery, either neglect it if they plea&s;e, or if they
&s;ee cau&s;e enquire into it, and puni&s;h the Delinquent
according to his Demerit, and in the clo&s;e of the
Sentence or Warrant for execution add this Clau&s;e,
<HI>Quod ad Scandalum Eccle&s;iae datum remittimus te ad
Presbyterium.</HI> Now at la&s;t, all they can do, is to
exact of him a public Confe&s;&s;ion before the Church,
and a promi&s;e of Amendment for the future. As
for Ordination, it is given by the Council of four by
Impo&s;ition of Hands, after examination of the per|&s;on
to be ordained, and Te&s;timonials exhibited from
the Univer&s;ity or other Per&s;ons of known Credit.
The Prince receives all Tithes, except &s;uch as in
&s;ome places for conveniencies &s;ake are paid imme|diately
to the Mini&s;ters; and other Church-Reve|nues,
mo&s;t whereof is paid out again in Stipends to
the Mini&s;ters, which the Prince proportions accor|dieg
to their Merit and his own Di&s;cretion; the re&s;t
is re&s;erved for Emergencies.</P>

in the late <HI>German</HI> Wars. It lies as a Block in the
<HI>Frenchmens</HI> way, and is as it were the Rampart of
the Empire in the&s;e parts. The Government is by
a greater Council of 300, cho&s;en by the &s;everal Com|panies

out of the Lake divides it into two almo&s;t equal

one very broad for Carts and Hor&s;es to pa&s;s over.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es are built of Timber with Clay-Walls,

fortified as the Situation of it will permit, be&s;ides
the Wall, being encompa&s;&s;ed round with good
Earthworks and Trenches after the modern fa&s;hion.
The River <HI>Sele</HI> runs by and gives defence to it on
the South &s;ide, and a little lower empties it&s;elf into
the <HI>Limagus.</HI> The Citizens are given to Merchan|di&s;e,
all very bu&s;ie and indu&s;trious. They either
are rich or at lea&s;t &s;o e&s;teemed, and therefore envied
by their Neighbours of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Religion. Here
are no Guards of Soldiers at the City-Gates; no
Strangers examined or &s;earcht either at coming in
or going out. We ob&s;erved the colour of the Wa|ter
of the <HI>Zurich</HI>-Sea to be greeni&s;h and well ap|proaching
to that of Sea-water. Afterwards we
found the Water of all the Lakes and Rivers near
the <HI>Alpes</HI> to be of the &s;ame colour, at which we
were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed. For we were wont to
attribute that colour in the Sea-water to the mixture
of Salt that is in it, whereas the Water of the&s;e Lakes
and Rivers di&s;covers to the Ta&s;t nothing of Salt or
bracki&s;h. But afterwards con&s;idering that the&s;e Wa|ters
did con&s;i&s;t for the mo&s;t part of Snow di&s;&s;olved;
and that Snow is &s;uppo&s;ed to contein good &s;tore of
nitrous Salt, we thought it not altogether impro|bable
<PB N="103" REF="61">
that this Colour may be owing to the nitrous
Particles remaining in the Water, though they be not
copious enough to affect our Ta&s;t; and it would be
worth the while to di&s;til good quantities of this
Water, to &s;ee whether it would leave any Salt be|hind.</P>
<P>That the&s;e Lakes and Rivers do con&s;i&s;t for the
mo&s;t part of Snow-water it is manife&s;t, for that upon
the Mountains (excepting the lower parts of them)
no Rain falls in Winter-time, but only Snow, with
which the higher parts of them are covered to a
great thickne&s;s for at lea&s;t &s;ix moneths in the year;
and for that the Rivers that flow from the <HI>Alpes</HI> run
lowe&s;t in Winter, and abound mo&s;t with Water in
the Summer-time; &s;o that &s;ometimes they over|flow
their Banks in the hotte&s;t moneths of the year,
and when no Rain falls&punc; as my &s;elf can te&s;tifie con|cerning
the River <HI>Rhodanus;</HI> becau&s;e the Sun at the
&s;ea&s;on melts the Snow upon the Mountains. Hence
it appears, that their Opinion was not &s;o ab&s;urd
who attributed the yearly Increa&s;e and Overflowing
of the River <HI>Nilus</HI> to the di&s;&s;olution of the Snow
upon tho&s;e Mountains where it hath its fir&s;t Ri&s;e.
Though I do not think this to be the true Cau&s;e,
partly becau&s;e that part of the Earth where tho&s;e
Mountains lie is &s;o hot by rea&s;on of its Situation
under the direct and &s;ometimes perpendicular Beams
of the Sun, that it's not likely any Snow &s;hould fall,
much le&s;s lie there: chiefly becau&s;e Travellers gene|rally
agree, that in mo&s;t parts of that Climate where
tho&s;e Mountains lie, there are at that time of the
year great falls of Rain, to which therefore the
Overflowing of <HI>Nilus</HI> is more probably attributed.</P>

<HI>Orobus &s;ylvaticus purpureus vernus</HI> and <HI>Hepatica

<P><HI>Schaffhau&s;&s;en</HI> is &s;eated upon the River <HI>Rhene,</HI> over

further by rea&s;on of great Stones in the Chanel, and
the precipitious De&s;cent of the water at <HI>Wa&s;&s;erfall.</HI>
This Town is well-built, (the Hou&s;es being mo&s;t of
Stone) walled about and intrencht. It hath two
fair Streets hand&s;omly paved, be&s;ides many other
&s;mall ones. Here as at <HI>Zurich,</HI> the Citizens when
they walk abroad wear their Swords. As to the
Civil Government, the Citizens are divided into
twelve Tribes or Companies. Each Tribe chu&s;es
two <HI>Tribuni Plebis,</HI> and the&s;e 24 make the le&s;&s;er
or ordinary Council. The great Council con&s;i&s;ts of
the&s;e and &s;ixty more, cho&s;en al&s;o by the Companies,

or two Brothers cannot be together of the Council.
By the greater Council are cho&s;en yearly two Con|&s;uls
or Burgoma&s;ters, two Quae&s;tors, one Procon&s;ul,
and one <HI>Aedilis,</HI> but for the mo&s;t part they chu&s;e the

<P>Yet it &s;eemed to me but &s;lenderly fortified, having
toward the Water only a Wall, and toward the
Land an earthen Rampart or Wall and Ditch drawn
at a good di&s;tance from the Stone-Wall. It hath
indeed advantage by its Situation, having a Lake
on one &s;ide and a fenny Level on the other.</P>

a fair Pro&s;pect of the &s;trong Town of <HI>Oberlingen.

Bridge of 290 paces, one half of it being Stone,
and the other (that is that next the Town) Wood,

which may upon occa&s;ion ea&s;ily be taken down and
removed. This City be&s;ides its natural Strength by
rea&s;on of its Situation, is al&s;o artificially fortified
with &s;tout Walls and Bulwarks &s;tanding in the Wa|ter,
that &s;ide mo&s;t which is neare&s;t the Land. On
that &s;ide toward the Lake are many Rows of great
Stakes driven into the ground, to hinder the ap|proach
of any Boat or Ve&s;&s;el to the Town. So that
a man would think this place impregnable. The
Streets and Hou&s;es are not &s;o &s;patious and fair as
tho&s;e of <HI>Con&s;tance,</HI> yet proper enough: Several
Fountains al&s;o there are in the Streets. Towards
the <HI>Bodenzee</HI> are two Walls, and between the Walls
a large vacant &s;pace of Land wherein Vineyards are
planted, of the Grapes whereof are &s;aid to be made
yearly 100 Fudders, that is 300 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hog&s;heads
of Wine. Eight Villages belong to this City, their
Territory extending about three hours.</P>

Re&s;pect, not to &s;ay Admiration, it being the mo&s;t
magnificent and &s;umptuous Edifice for a Hou&s;e, that
we have any where hitherto &s;een beyond the Seas.
In the great Garden of this Palace we &s;aw many
rare Plants, among the re&s;t we e&s;pecially took no|tice
of the <HI>Aloe-trees</HI> (for &s;o I may well call them

&s;hoot up in one year) of which there were more, I
verlly think, in this one Garden than in all <HI>Europe</HI>

In this City &s;o far remote from our native Countrey
it &s;eemed &s;trange to us to find a Cloi&s;ter of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nuns. We thought it worth noting that the Bodies
of the Churches here are filled with Pews and Seats,

were diligent Search and Ob&s;ervation made. That
they have not been di&s;covered or taken notice of in
other parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> is cer|tainly
to be attributed to the Negligence and Rede|ne&s;s
of the People who mind nothing that is curious,
<PB N="120" REF="70" MS="y">
or to the want of learned Writers who &s;hould com|municate
the Hi&s;tories of them to the World.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="II"> I come now to give an account of the Opinions of
the be&s;t Authors concerning the Original and Pro|duction
of the&s;e Stones.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and to me mo&s;t probable Opinion is that
they were originally the Shells or Bones of living
Fi&s;hes and other Animals bred in the Sea. This
was the general Opinion of the Antients, in&s;omuch
that <HI>Steno</HI> &s;aith, It was never made a Que&s;tion
among them, whether &s;uch Bodies came from any
place el&s;e but the Sea. It hath of late times and is
now received and embraced by divers learned and
ingenious Philo&s;ophers, as in the precedent age by
<HI>Fraca&s;torius,</HI> and in the pre&s;ent by <HI>Nicolaus Steno</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Robert Hook,</HI> after whom I need name no
more to give it countenance and authority in the
World. In his <HI>Micrographia,</HI> Ob&s;erv. 17. He thus
di&s;cour&s;es concerning the&s;e Bodies. Examining
&s;ome of the&s;e very curiou&s;ly figured Bodies (found
about <HI>Kein&s;ham,</HI> which are commonly thought to
be Stones formed by &s;ome extraordinary <HI>pla&s;tic</HI> Vir|tue
latent in the Earth it&s;elf) I took notice of the&s;e
particulars.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, that the&s;e figured Bodies were of very dif|fering
Sub&s;tances as to hardne&s;s: &s;ome of Clay,
&s;ome Marl, &s;ome &s;oft Stone, almo&s;t of the hardne&s;s
of tho&s;e Stones, which Ma&s;ons call Fire-Stone,
others as hard as <HI>Portland</HI> Stone, others as hard as
Marble, and &s;ome as hard as a Flint or Cry&s;tal.</P>
<P>Next, they were of very differing Sub&s;tances as
to Tran&s;parency and Colour; &s;ome white, &s;ome
almo&s;t black, &s;ome brown, &s;ome metalline or like
Marca&s;ites, &s;ome tran&s;parent like white Marble,
others like flaw'd Cry&s;tal, &s;ome gray, &s;ome of divers
colours; &s;ome radiated like tho&s;e long <HI>petrified drops,</HI>
which are commonly found at the <HI>Peak</HI> and in other
&s;ubterraneous Caverns, which have a kind of Pith
in the middle.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="70">
Thirdly, that they were very different as to the
manner of their outward Figuration: for &s;ome of
them &s;eem'd to have been the Sub&s;tance that had filled
the Shell of &s;ome kind of Shell-fi&s;h; others to have
been the Sub&s;tance that had conteined or enwrapped
one of the&s;e Shells, on both which the perfect impre&s;|&s;ion
either of the in&s;ide or out&s;ide of &s;uch Shels &s;eem'd
to be left, but for the mo&s;t part tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions &s;eem|ed
to be made by an imperfect or broken Shell, the
great end or mouth of the Shell being always wanting
and oftentimes the little end and &s;ometimes half,
and in &s;ome there were Impre&s;&s;ions, ju&s;t as if there
had been Holes broken in the figurating, imprinting
or moulding Shell: &s;ome of them &s;eem'd to be made
by &s;uch a Shell very much brui&s;ed or flaw'd, in&s;o|much
that one would verily have thought, that very
figured Stone had been broken or brui&s;ed whil&s;t a
Gelly as 'twere, and &s;o hardned, but within the
Grain of the Stone there appeared not any &s;ign of
any &s;uch brui&s;e or breaking, but only on the very
uttermo&s;t Superficies.</P>
<P>Fourthly, they were very different as to their
outward covering, &s;ome having the perfect Shell
both in Figure, Colour and Sub&s;tance &s;ticking on
its &s;urface, and adhering to it, but might very ea&s;ily
be &s;eparated from it, and like other common <HI>Cochle</HI>
or <HI>Scallop</HI>-&s;hells, which &s;ome of them mo&s;t accurately
re&s;embled, were very di&s;&s;oluble in common Vinegar:
others of them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e <HI>&s;erpentine</HI> or <HI>helical</HI>
Stones, were covered with or reteined the &s;hining
or pearl-coloured Sub&s;tance of the in&s;ide of the Shell,
which Sub&s;tance on &s;ome parts of them was exceed|ing
thin, and might very ea&s;ily be rubbed off; on
other parts it was pretty thick, and reteined a white
Coat or flaky Sub&s;tance on the top, ju&s;t like the &s;ides
of &s;uch Shells: &s;ome of them had large pieces of
the Shell very plainly &s;ticking on to them, which
were ea&s;ily to be broken or flaked off by degrees:
<PB N="122" REF="71">
they likewi&s;e &s;ome of them reteined all along the
&s;urface of them very pretty kind of Sutures, &s;uch as
are ob&s;erved in the Skulls of &s;everal kinds of living
Creatures, which Sutures were mo&s;t curiou&s;ly &s;haped
in the manner of Leaves, and every one of them in
the &s;ame Shell exactly one like another; which I
was able to di&s;cover plainly enough with my naked
eye, but more perfectly and di&s;tinctly with my Mi|cro&s;cope:
All the&s;e Sutures I found by breaking
&s;ome of the Stones to be the <HI>Termini</HI> or boundings
of certain <HI>Diaphragms</HI> or partitions, which &s;eemed
to divide the Cavity of the Shell into a multitude of
very proportionate and regular Cells or Caverns:
the&s;e Diaphragms in many of them I found very
perfect and complete, of a very di&s;tinct Sub&s;tance
from that which filled the Cavities, and exactly
of the &s;ame kind with that which covered the out|&s;ide,
being for the mo&s;t part whiti&s;h or <HI>mother of-Pearl</HI>
coloured.</P>
<P>As for the Cavities between tho&s;e <HI>Diaphragms,</HI> I
found &s;ome of them fill'd with Marl, and others
with &s;everal kinds of Stones, others for the mo&s;t
part hollow, only the whole Cavity was u&s;ually
covered over with a kind of <HI>Tartareous petrified</HI> Sub|&s;tance,
which &s;tuck about the Sides, and was there
&s;hot into very curious regular Figures, ju&s;t as <HI>Tartar</HI>
or other di&s;&s;olved Salts are ob&s;erved to &s;tick and
<HI>cry&s;tallize</HI> about the &s;ides of the conteining Ve&s;&s;els;
or like tho&s;e little <HI>Diamants,</HI> which I before ob&s;er|ved
to have covered the vaulted Cavity of a Flint;
others had the&s;e Cavities all lined with a <HI>metalline</HI>
or <HI>Marca&s;ite-like</HI> &s;ub&s;tance, which I could with a
<HI>Micro&s;cope</HI> as plainly &s;ee mo&s;t curiou&s;ly and regularly
figured, as I had done tho&s;e in a Flint.</P>
<P>From all which and &s;everal other particulars
which I ob&s;erved, I cannot but think, that all the&s;e,
and mo&s;t other kinds of &s;tony bodies which are found
thus &s;trangely figured, do ow their Formation and
<PB N="123" REF="71" MS="y">
Figuration not to any kind of <HI>Pla&s;tic Virtue</HI> inherent
in the Earth, but to the Shells of certain Shell-fi&s;hes,
which either by &s;ome Deluge, Inundation,
Earthquake or &s;ome &s;uch other means came to
be thrown to that place, and there to be filled
with &s;ome kind of Mud or Clay, or <HI>petrifying</HI> Wa|ter
or &s;ome other Sub&s;tance, which in tract of time
hath been &s;etled together and hardned in tho&s;e &s;helly
Moulds into tho&s;e &s;haped Sub&s;tances we now find
them; That the great and thin end of the&s;e Shells,
by that Earthquake, or whatever other extraordi|nary
cau&s;e it was that brought them thither, was
broken off; and that many others were otherwi&s;e
broken, brui&s;ed and disfigured; that the&s;e Shells
which are thus &s;pirallied and &s;eparated with Dia|phragms,
were &s;ome kind of <HI>Nautili</HI> or <HI>Porcelane-Shells;</HI>
and that others were Shells of <HI>Mu&s;cles,
Cochles, Periwinkles, Scallops,</HI> &amp;c. of various &s;orts;
that the&s;e Shells in many from the particular nature
of the conteining or inclo&s;ed earth or &s;ome other
cau&s;e, have in tract of time rotted and mouldred
away, and only left their Impre&s;&s;ions both on the
conteining and conteined Sub&s;tances; and &s;o left
them pretty loo&s;e one within another, &s;o that they
may ea&s;ily be &s;eparated by a knock or two of a ham|mer.
That others of the&s;e Shell-fi&s;hes according to
the nature of the Sub&s;tances have by a long continu|ance
in that po&s;ture, been petrified and turned into
the nature of Stone. That oftentimes the Shell
may be found with one kind of Sub&s;tance within and
quite another without, having perhaps been filled
in one place and afterwards tran&s;lated to another,
which I have very frequently ob&s;erved in <HI>Cochle,
Mu&s;cle, Periwincle,</HI> and other Shells, which I have
found by the Sea-&s;ide. Nay further, that &s;ome parts
of the &s;ame Shell may be filled in one place, and &s;ome
other Caverns in another, and others in a third or
a fourth or a fifth place, for &s;o many differing Sub|&s;tances
<PB N="124" REF="72" MS="y">
have I found in one of the petrified Shells,
and perhaps all the&s;e differing from the encompa&s;&s;ing
Earth or Stone: The means how all which varieties
may be caus'd, I think will not be difficult to conceive,
to any one that has taken notice of tho&s;e Shells, which
are commonly found on the Sea-&s;hore: And he
that &s;hall throughly examin, &s;everal kinds of &s;uch
curiou&s;ly form'd Stones, will (I am very apt to think)
find rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e their generation or formation
to be a&s;cribable to &s;ome &s;uch Accidents as I have
mentioned, and not to any <HI>Pla&s;tic Virtue.</HI> For it
&s;eems to me quite contrary to the infinite prudence
of Nature, which is ob&s;ervable in all its works and
productions, to de&s;ign every thing to a determinate
end, and for the atteining that end makes u&s;e of
&s;uch ways as are (as far as the knowledge of man
has yet been able to reach) altogether con&s;onant and
mo&s;t agreeable to mans rea&s;on, and of no way or
means that doth contradict or is contrary to human
ratiocination; whence it has a long time been a ge|neral
Ob&s;ervation and <HI>Maxim,</HI> that <HI>Nature doth no|thing
in vain:</HI> it &s;eems I &s;ay contrary to that great
wi&s;dom of Nature, that the&s;e prettily &s;haped Bodies
&s;hould have all tho&s;e curious figures and contrivan|ces
(which many of them are adorn'd and contriv'd
with) generated or wrought by a <HI>Pla&s;tic Virtue,</HI> for
no higher end than only to exhibit &s;uch a form;
which he that &s;hall throughly con&s;ider all the circum|&s;tances
of &s;uch kind of figured Bodies, will I think
have great rea&s;on to believe, though I confe&s;s one
cannot be able pre&s;ently to find out what Natures
de&s;igns are. Thus far Mr. <HI>Hook.</HI> And <HI>Steno</HI> agrees
exactly with him, and is far more po&s;itive and con|fident;
For (&s;aith he) that the&s;e Shells were once
the parts of Animals living in a fluid, though there
never had been any te&s;taceous marine Creatures, the
very view of the Shell it&s;elf evinceth, as may be
evident by the in&s;tance of <HI>bivalve Cochle-&s;hells.</HI> Con|cerning
<PB REF="73">
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="4 pages">
<PB N="129" REF="74">
the&s;e Shells his Ob&s;ervations and Di&s;cour&s;es
are very con&s;onant with Mr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s. One or two
particulars not yet mentioned, which may further
confirm this Opinion, I find in him, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) That
there was found a Pearl-bearing Shell in <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI>
a Pearl yet &s;ticking to the Shell. (2.) A piece of
the greater Sea-nacre [<HI>Piuna marina</HI>] in which the
&s;ilk-like &s;ub&s;tance within the Shell being con&s;umed,
the colour of that &s;ub&s;tance did remain in that earthy
matter which had filled the Shell. (3.) That about
the City of <HI>Volterra</HI> there are many beds of earth not
&s;tony, which do abound with true Cochle-&s;hells
that have &s;uffered no change at all, and yet they
mu&s;t needs have lain there above 3000 years; whence
it is evident, that part of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> was of old time
covered with the Sea, and why then might not as
well all tho&s;e other places where the&s;e petrified Shells
are found.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this Opinion lie two very con&s;iderable
and material Objections, which I &s;hall heer pro|pound.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, it will hence follow that all the Earth was
once covered by the Sea, and that for a con&s;iderable
time: for there being found of the&s;e Shells in the
middle of <HI>Germany,</HI> at lea&s;t 200 miles di&s;tant from
any Sea, as my &s;elf can witne&s;s, nay, upon the high|e&s;t
Mountains of <HI>Europe,</HI> even the <HI>Alps</HI> them&s;elves,
(as may be proved by &s;ufficient Authority) the Sea
mu&s;t needs have covered them, and con&s;equently,
the water keeping its level, all <HI>Europe</HI> and the World
be&s;ides. Now that ever the Water &s;hould have co|vered
the Earth to that highth as to exceed the tops
of the highe&s;t Mountains, and for a con&s;iderable
time abode there, is hard to believe, nor can &s;uch
an Opinion be ea&s;ily reconciled with the Scripture.
If it be &s;aid that the&s;e Shells were brought in by
the univer&s;al Deluge in the time of <HI>Noah,</HI> when the
Mountains were covered. I an&s;wer, that that De|luge
<PB N="126" REF="75">
proceeded from Rain, which was more likely
to carry Shells down to the Sea, than to bring any
upwards from it. But becau&s;e &s;ome may argue from
what the Scripture &s;aith, [<HI>The fountains of the great
deep were broken up,</HI>] that the Deluge proceeded part|ly
from a breaking forth and overflowing of the Sea,
and con&s;equently might bring in the&s;e Shells: To
that I an&s;wer, that had it been &s;o, &s;uch a Flood
would have been more likely to &s;catter &s;uch Shells
as it brought in indifferently all over the &s;urface of
the Earth, than to lay them in great beds in particu|lar
places: &s;uch beds &s;eem to have been the effect of
tho&s;e Animals breeding there for &s;ome con&s;iderable
time. If it be &s;aid, that tho&s;e Mountains where &s;uch
Shells are found might at fir&s;t have been low places,
and afterwards rai&s;ed up by Earthquakes, that &s;eems
not likely, becau&s;e they are found upon &s;o many
Mountains, unle&s;s it be &s;aid, that all Mountains
were at fir&s;t &s;o rai&s;ed, and then the former difficulty
will recurr, and it will follow, that before the rai|&s;ing
of the fir&s;t Mountains, the whole Earth was
covered by the Sea. Be&s;ides, this <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> &s;eems
to me in it&s;elf improbable, for that though there be
mention made in Hi&s;tories of &s;ome &s;uch Mountains
rai&s;ed by Earthquakes, yet they are but very few and
of no con&s;iderable highth or greatne&s;s, compared
with tho&s;e chains of high and va&s;t Mountains, the
<HI>Alps, Pyrenees, Appennine, Taurus, Cauca&s;us, Imaus,
Haemus, Atlas,</HI> &amp;c. In general &s;ince the mo&s;t anti|ent
times recorded in Hi&s;tory, the face of the Earth
hath &s;uffered little change, the &s;ame Mountains,
I&s;lands, Promontories, Lakes, Rivers &s;till remain|ing,
and very few added, lo&s;t or removed. Whence
it will follow, that if the Mountains were not from
the beginning, either the World is a great deal older
than is imagined or believed, there being an incre|dible
&s;pace of time required to work &s;uch changes as
rai&s;ing all the Mountains, according to the lei&s;urely
<PB N="127" REF="75">
proceedings of Nature in mutations of that kind
&s;ince the fir&s;t Records of Hi&s;tory: or that in the
primitive times and &s;oon after the Creation the earth
&s;uffered far more concu&s;&s;ions and mutations in its
&s;uperficial part than afterward.</P>
<P>II. Among the&s;e petrified Shells are many &s;orts,
which are not at this day that we know of any where
to be found; nay &s;ome proceed &s;o far as to affirm,
that there is not the like to any one of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed
petrified Shells to be found among our pre&s;ent Shell-fi&s;hes.
If it be &s;aid, that the&s;e Species be lo&s;t out
of the World: that is a &s;uppo&s;ition which Philo|&s;ophers
hitherto have been unwilling to admit,
e&s;teeming the de&s;truction of any one Species to be a
di&s;membring the Univer&s;e and rendring it imper|fect,
whereas they think the Divine Providence is
e&s;pecially concerned to pre&s;erve and &s;ecure all the
Works of the Creation. Yet granting that &s;ome few
Species might be lo&s;t, it is very unlikely that &s;o many
&s;hould, and &s;till more unlikely that &s;uch as were &s;o
diffu&s;ed all over <HI>Europe</HI> and found in &s;o many places;
but mo&s;t of all that a whole <HI>Genus,</HI> of which there
were &s;o many &s;everal Species, and tho&s;e &s;cattered in
&s;o many di&s;tinct and from each other remote places,
&s;hould be &s;o utterly extinct and gone, at lea&s;t out of
our Seas, that there &s;hould not one in an age be found.
Such are for example the <HI>Serpentine</HI> Stones or <HI>Cornua
Ammonis</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed originally to have been <HI>Nautili,</HI>
of which I my &s;elf have &s;een five or &s;ix di&s;tinct Spe|cies,
and doubtle&s;s there are yet many more. Add
heerunto the greatne&s;s of &s;ome of the&s;e Shells, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Cornua Ammonis,</HI> whereof there are found of about
a foot Diameter, far exceeding the bulk of any Shell-fi&s;h
now breeding or living in our Seas.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Opinion is of tho&s;e who imagine
the&s;e bodies to have been the effects and products of
&s;ome Pla&s;tic power in the Earth; and to have been
formed after the manner of Diamants and other pre|tious
<PB N="128" REF="76">
Stones, or the Cry&s;tals of coagulated Salts, by
&s;hooting into &s;uch figures. Of the&s;e bodies my
very ingenious and learned Friend Mr. <HI>Martin Li&s;ter</HI>
di&s;cour&s;es in a Letter of his in&s;erted in the <HI>Philo&s;oph.
Tran&s;act.</HI> Numb. 76. to this purpo&s;e, upon occa&s;ion
of Mr. <HI>Steno</HI>'s <HI>Prodromus.</HI> We will ea&s;ily believe,
that in &s;ome Countries, and particularly along the
&s;hore of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, there may all manner
of Shell-fi&s;hes be found promi&s;cuou&s;ly included in
rocks or earth, and at good di&s;tances too from the
Sea. But for our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> inland Quarries, which
al&s;o abound with infinite numbers and great varieties
of Shells, I am apt to think there is no &s;uch matter
as petrifying of Shells in the bu&s;ine&s;s (or as <HI>Steno</HI> ex|plains
him&s;elf, Pag. 84. in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ver&s;ion <HI>&amp; alibi,</HI>
that the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e Shells formerly belonging
to Animals, hath been di&s;&s;olved or wa&s;ted by the
penetrating force of Juices, and that a &s;tony &s;ub&s;tance
is come in the place thereof) but that the&s;e Cochle|like
Stones ever were as they are at pre&s;ent, <HI>Lapides
&s;ui generis,</HI> and never any part of an Animal. That
they are &s;o at pre&s;ent is in effect confe&s;&s;ed by <HI>Steno</HI>
in the above-cited page; and it is mo&s;t certain, that
our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Quarry-&s;hells (to continue that abu&s;ive
name) have no parts of a different texture from the
Rock or Quarry they are taken, that is, that there
is no &s;uch thing as Shell in the&s;e re&s;emblances of
Shells, but that Iron-&s;tone Cochles are all Iron-&s;tone,
Lime or Marble all Lime-&s;tone and Marble, Spar or
Cry&s;talline Shells all Spar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that they never
were any part of an Animal. My Rea&s;on is, that
Quarries of different Stone yield us quite different
&s;orts or Species of Shells, not only one from another
(as tho&s;e Cochle-&s;tones of the Iron-&s;tone Quarries
of <HI>Adderton</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> differ from tho&s;e found in
the Lead-Mines of the neighbouring Mountains, and
both the&s;e from that Cochle-Quarry of <HI>Wansford</HI>-Bridge
in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> and all thee from tho&s;e
<PB N="129" REF="76">
to be found in the Quarries about <HI>Gunthorp</HI> and
<HI>Beauvo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI>-Ca&s;tle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) but I dare boldly &s;ay from any
thing in Nature be&s;ides, that either the Land, &s;alt
or fre&s;h Waters do yield us. 'Tis true that I have
picked out of that one Quarry of <HI>Wansford</HI> very re|&s;emblances
of <HI>Murices, Tellinae, Turbines, Cochleae,
&amp;c.</HI> and yet I am not convinc'd, when I particularly
examined &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shores for Shells, as
al&s;o the fre&s;h Waters and the Fields, that I did ever
meet with any one of tho&s;e Species of Shells any
where el&s;e but in their re&s;pective Quarries, whence I
conclude them <HI>Lapides &s;ui generis,</HI> and that they
were not ca&s;t in any Animal mould who&s;e Species or
race is yet to be found in being at this day. Thus
far Mr. <HI>Li&s;ter.</HI> The like Argument al&s;o <HI>Goropius
Becanus</HI> u&s;es to prove that the&s;e Bodies are not petri|fied
Shells. <HI>Scallop-&s;hells</HI> (&s;aith he) are &s;o rare upon
the &s;hores of <HI>Flanders,</HI> that they are brought thither
by Pilgrims from the coa&s;t of <HI>Gallicia</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> and
&s;hown for &s;trange things; and yet in the ditches
about <HI>Antwerp</HI> there is &s;uch plenty of them, that in
digging there they throw up heaps of them like little
mountains, &s;o that he that would gather of them
need not take the pains to travel to <HI>Gallicia,</HI> or &s;o
much as to the Sea-&s;hores. To the&s;e he adds ano|ther
Argument which yet to me &s;eems of little force.
In &s;ome places about <HI>Antwerp</HI> digging for water,
they meet with in the earth a cru&s;t or Layer of two
foot thickne&s;s and in &s;ome parts thinner, wholly
made up of Sea-&s;hells, whereas there was never
found &s;uch a Ma&s;s of Shells upon any of the Sea-&s;hores;
&s;o that no man can rea&s;onably a&s;&s;ert that
they were thrown up by the Sea and there left, the
waters receding and for&s;aking them; for then with|out
que&s;tion we &s;hould hear of the like heaps or beds
of them found on the coa&s;ts of <HI>Holland, Zealand</HI> and
<HI>Flanders</HI> But to this I an&s;wer that the rea&s;on why
at this day there are not &s;uch beds of them to be
<PB N="130" REF="77">
found upon the &s;hores, may be, becau&s;e they are ga|thered
up and carried away by men, partly out of
curio&s;ity, partly to burn for lime or other ways to
make u&s;e of. Be&s;ides we know that in the bottom
of the Sea, the&s;e Shell-fi&s;hes many times lie in great
beds, and there breed in great abundance, and it
is not altogether unlikely, that the Sea might
on occa&s;ion &s;uddenly recede and de&s;ert &s;uch beds,
and they afterwards come to be buried in the Earth.</P>
<P>But to argue further in defence of this Opinion.
There are found in the earth many &s;uch like figured
Stones which we know not whither to refer, as re|&s;embling
neither any part of an Animal, nor of a
Plant: Such are tho&s;e that Naturali&s;ts call <HI>Lapides
Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">curii, Belemnites, Lapides Judaivi, Trochites,
A&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eriae</HI> and others, to which if there be at pre&s;ent
any Shells, Bones, Fruits, Roots, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> like, I am
as yet wholly to &s;eek for them. And if there are
now no &s;uch things in being, they that defend the
contrary Opinion mu&s;t have recour&s;e to that gratu|itous
&s;uppo&s;ition that &s;uch Species are lo&s;t out of the
World.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides I have been told by a per&s;on of good cre|dit
of a Stone of this nature re&s;embling a Cochle-&s;hell
found in the &s;tomach of a Beef; where in all
likelihood it mu&s;t be bred and &s;hoot into that figure;
which if true, there can be no rea&s;on to doubt, but
tho&s;e in the Stone-Quarries and other places are &s;o
generated.</P>
<P>A third Opinion there is, that &s;ome of the&s;e
bodies are really Shells petrified, or the ca&s;es of &s;uch
bodies or their contents: and that others of them
are &s;tones of their own kind re&s;embling &s;uch Shells,
&s;o &s;haped and figured by &s;ome Pla&s;tic power. That
Shells may be and are &s;ometimes petrified (as are
al&s;o Bones and Wood) cannot be denied, and I my
&s;elf have gathered &s;uch upon the Sea-&s;hore; and on
the other hand, he that a&s;&s;erts that there are bodies
<PB N="131" REF="77">
naturally growing in the earth, which do imitate
Sea-&s;hells, delivers him&s;elf from the trouble of an|&s;wering
the Arguments which urge the contrary
opinion. But yet methinks this is but a &s;hift and
refuge to avoid trouble, there not being &s;ufficient
ground to found &s;uch a di&s;tinction. For my own
part I confe&s;s I propend to the fir&s;t Opinion, as
being more con&s;onant to the nature of the thing,
and could wi&s;h that all external arguments and obje|ctions
again&s;t it were rationally and &s;olidly an&s;wered.</P>

one goes down, &s;tands <HI>Dreckendorf,</HI> a walled town
belonging to the Duke of <HI>Bavaria.</HI> A little further
off we pa&s;&s;ed by the mouth of the river <HI>I&s;er.</HI> Then
we had a pro&s;pect of <HI>O&s;terhoven</HI> on our left hand, and
not far thence a &s;mall village called <HI>Hofkirchen,</HI> and
on the &s;ame &s;ide &s;till a little ca&s;tle called <HI>Hilkersberg,</HI>
where the &s;hores along the river began to be rocky.
This night we lodged at a pretty little walled
town built of &s;tone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vil&s;ho|ven.</NOTE> called <HI>Vil&s;hoven,</HI> belonging to
<HI>Bavaria.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 13.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa&s;&s;aw.</NOTE> At four miles di&s;tance from <HI>Vil&s;hoven</HI> we
came to <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw,</HI> a con&s;iderable city for its &s;trength
and greatne&s;s, formerly well built with many fair
&s;tone hou&s;es. But about three quarters of a year
before our being there, a mo&s;t dreadful Fire burnt
down, ruin'd and de&s;troy'd almo&s;t the whole Town,
Churches, public buildings and all. It is &s;ituate
ju&s;t at the confluence of the rivers <HI>In</HI> and <HI>Danow,</HI>
and &s;ubject to the Archduke of <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> who, we
were told, gave 50000 dollars towards the rebuild|ing
of it. Heer is a bridge over the river <HI>In</HI> to a
town called <HI>In&s;tat.</HI> Hitherto the river <HI>Danow</HI> flow|ed
gently down, but below <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw,</HI> it began to be
&s;treightned by hills on both &s;ides and to run with a
&s;wifter &s;tream. Seven miles from <HI>Pa&s;&s;aw</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by
<HI>Nayhon&s;e</HI> ca&s;tle, and this third night lodged at a
pretty little village belonging to the Emperor called
<HI>A&s;ch,</HI> &s;tanding on the right &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 14. we had an open countrey again, no hills
being near the river. At four miles end we landed
at <HI>Lintz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lintz.</NOTE> and viewed the city, which we found to
be a very elegant place, well built with &s;tone hou|&s;es
flat rooft after the <HI>Italian</HI> fa&s;hion; having a large
&s;quare <HI>Piazza</HI> with two fountains in it, and on the
highe&s;t part a fair palace of the Emperor, whence
there is a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the <HI>Danow</HI> and Coun|trey
adjacent. About three miles below <HI>Lintz</HI> we
<PB N="139" REF="81">
pa&s;&s;ed a pretty village on our left hand, called <HI>Mal|hau&s;en.</HI>
Then we had a pro&s;pect of a town on our
right hand &s;ituate upon the river <HI>Ens</HI> called <HI>Intz.</HI>
Seven miles below <HI>Lintz</HI> are hills again on both &s;ides
the river. Heerabouts is a village called <HI>Greine,</HI>
where the Earl of <HI>Lichten&s;tein</HI> hath a hou&s;e &s;ituate
on a hill. Below <HI>Greine</HI> on the left hand is a little
village, where we pa&s;t a dangerous place in the river
called <HI>Strom,</HI> where the &s;tream being &s;treightned by
hills on each hand runs very &s;wiftly, and be&s;ides is
full of rocks: a little further below a rock, which
jets a good way out into the river, we pa&s;&s;ed a vio|lent
whirtl-pool called the <HI>Werble.</HI> At &s;ome di&s;tance
further on the left hand &s;tands a &s;mall village under
a high hill, half whereof fell down about two years
before our being there, which made &s;o great a noi&s;e
that it was heard two <HI>German</HI> miles off, at <HI>Ips,</HI> a
little town we pa&s;&s;ed by on the right hand. We lod|ged
this fourth night at a &s;mall village called <HI>Mor|pach,</HI>
11 miles from <HI>Lintz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sept.</HI> 15. in the morning we went by a rich cloi|&s;ter
called <HI>Melk</HI> on our right. At &s;ix miles di&s;tance
from our lodging we pa&s;&s;ed a fair hou&s;e of the Earl
of <HI>Dern&s;tein</HI>'s on our left hand, and heerabout had
a pro&s;pect of <HI>Ketwein</HI> a rich Abby &s;trongly &s;ituate on
a hill, attempted by the <HI>Swedes</HI> without &s;uccche&s;s.
About nine miles from <HI>Marbach</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed under a
wooden bridge by a little walled town called <HI>Stein,</HI>
where the <HI>Swedes</HI> (they told us) were notably beaten
and driven out again after they had entred the town;
which repul&s;e they afterwards revenged, when they
took the place, by plundering and &s;poiling it. Not
far hence we landed to view <HI>Krembs,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Krembs.</NOTE> a con&s;iderable
city &s;eated on the &s;ide of a hill, well-built, walled
about and trenched towards the river. From hence
we came into an open countrey, and the river being
at liberty, the chanel grew much wider. Six miles
below <HI>Krembs</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed by a &s;mall walled Town oh
<PB N="140" REF="82">
the right hand called <HI>Deuln;</HI> then we had the pro|&s;pect
of <HI>Greiten&s;tein,</HI> a ca&s;tle &s;ituate on a hill at &s;ome
di&s;tance from the river on the left hand; next we
had a &s;ight of <HI>Cornberg,</HI> a wall'd town in a plain
not far from the <HI>Danow;</HI> taken by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the
late wars and by them notably defended again&s;t the
Emperor. Heer and afterward at &s;everal other pla|ces
we ob&s;erved mills built upon two boats, the
wheel lying between the boats, which are fixed at
a convenient di&s;tance one from another, and &s;o the
&s;tream coming between the boats, and by rea&s;on it
is &s;treightned by degrees, running more &s;wiftly,
turns the wheel. One of the boats is by &s;trong cables
or chains at each end fa&s;tned to the bank, and &s;o
the boats, mill and all ri&s;e and fall with the water.
About a mile and half before we reach'd <HI>Vienna</HI> we
went by a fair rich Abby called <HI>Clai&s;ternaiberg,</HI> with
a little wall'd town of the &s;ame name; and at the
end of 19 <HI>German</HI> miles, which the &s;wiftne&s;s of the
current a&s;&s;i&s;ting us, we made this day, we arrived at
<HI>Vienna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vienna.</NOTE> the chief city of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and at pre&s;ent the
imperial &s;eat, &s;o called from the river <HI>Wien</HI> which
runs into the <HI>Danow</HI> no the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Town.
It is for the bigne&s;s of it the mo&s;t frequent and full
of people that we have yet &s;een beyond the &s;eas. The
wall is not above four or five <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles in cir|cuit,
but there are large Suburbs at a little di&s;tance
from the town, tho&s;e hou&s;es that were very near
being lately pull'd down to clear the wall and works
for fear of a Siege: The <HI>Tures</HI> at the time of our
being there having taken <HI>Neuhau&s;el,</HI> and news com|ing
that they were marching with their whole army
towards <HI>Presburg</HI> in <HI>Hungary,</HI> not above 40 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
miles di&s;tant from <HI>Vienna.</HI> This City is regularly
and &s;trongly fortified with a high and impenetrable
wall of earth faced with brick, a broad and deep
trench, into which they can (as they told us) when
they plea&s;e draw the water; Ba&s;tions, half-moons
<PB N="141" REF="82">
and horn-words, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that it is ju&s;tly reputed one
of the &s;tronge&s;t holds of Chri&s;tendom. The inner
wall, which was &s;aid to be built with the ran&s;om of
<HI>Richard.</HI> I. King of <HI>England,</HI> is of little &s;trength or
con&s;ideration in compari&s;on with the new and outer
one. The hou&s;es are &s;ufficiently tall and well built
of &s;tone, the roofs flatti&s;h after the <HI>Italian</HI> mode:
The &s;treets rather narrow than broad; the markets
well &s;tored with all nece&s;&s;aries. Heer we fir&s;t met
with tortoi&s;es to be &s;old, at the rate of &s;ix pence
apiece: they are found in muddy ditches in the&s;e
parts. Heer al&s;o we fir&s;t took notice of the fruit
of <HI>Sorbus legitima;</HI> and fir&s;t &s;aw in the fi&s;h-markets
the <HI>Silurus</HI> or Sheat-fi&s;h, the greate&s;t of all fre&s;h|water

would take it to be a Wood. Again&s;t every Tree
is planted a Vine, which runs up the tree, and
the branches of the neighbour-vines they draw
from tree to tree and tie together: So that their
Corn-fields are al&s;o Woods and Vine-yards, the
&s;ame land &s;ufficing for all the&s;e productions, and
not being exhau&s;ted with &s;o much &s;pending (as
one would be apt to imagine) by rea&s;on of the
depth and richne&s;s of its &s;oil. Neither in this
hot Countrey doth the Corn receive any preju|dice
from the &s;hade or dropping of the Trees,
(which in our colder Climate would quite marr
it) but rather advantage, there falling little rain
in Summer-time, and the Trees keeping off the
&s;corching Sun-beams, which el&s;e might dry up and
wither it; the heat notwith&s;tanding &s;ufficing to
bring the Grain to perfect maturity. Whereas
with us all the Sun we can give it is little enough,
and the very gra&s;s which grows under the trees
is &s;owr and crude: for that u&s;ually we have too
little heat for our moi&s;ture, and they too much.

The Sum total is 134871. <HI>San&s;ovinus</HI> reckons

I&s;lands, which in this &s;urvey are left out. I am not
ignorant that &s;everal late writers make the pre&s;ent
number of Inhabitants to be at lea&s;t 300000, but I
believe they &s;peak at random, and by conjecture,
upon no good grounds; (as I have been often told,
that there are in <HI>Paris</HI> a million and half of people,

being no rea&s;on to think that the Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> is much in|crea&s;ed
&s;ince <HI>San&s;ovinus</HI> his time. I find the Sum
total of the number of males to exceed the total of
the number of females in this &s;urvey by above 3500,
which comes near to the account of the exce&s;s of
males in <HI>England,</HI> given us by Capt. <HI>Graunt</HI> in his
Ob&s;ervations upon the weekly Bills of Mortality in
<HI>London.</HI> And I doubt not but if exact, ob&s;ervations

the like proportion between the number of males

in cold. So that from this Topic the <HI>A&s;iatics</HI> have
no greater plea for multiplicity of wives than the

the floor that no man can look into them, and yet

one hole. In each of the two outermo&s;t urns are
put about 800 balls made of copper and gilded over
with &s;ilver (which I &s;hall take leave to call &s;ilver
balls, as tho&s;e that are gilded with gold, golden
balls) &s;o that the whole number in both amounts

&s;ilver are mingled 60 golden balls, 30 in each urn.
In the middlemo&s;t urn are put 60 balls, where|of

into five benches of Gentlemen) and what end of
that bench, and what &s;ide of that end (for all the
benches are double) in this manner. There are put
into an urn ten &s;ilver balls, five of them marked with
the five fir&s;t figures or the characters of the numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and by each number is written &s;uch an
end and &s;uch a &s;ide. The other five balls are marked
with the &s;ame figures, but on each of them is writ|ten
the contrary end and contrary &s;ide. So that if
under the figure 1 in the fir&s;t five be written, the end
towards the <HI>Broil</HI> and the &s;ide towards S. <HI>Georges;</HI>
under the figure 1 in the other five is written, the
end towards <HI>Ca&s;tello</HI> and the &s;ide next S. <HI>Mark</HI>'s.
Then they draw out of the urn one of the&s;e balls,
the figure and in&s;cription whereof &s;hews what bench
and what end and &s;ide of that bench is to come fir&s;t
up to the <HI>Capello.</HI> Then they look into the urn and
take out that ball which is marked with the &s;ame fi|gure
and the contrary end and &s;ide. After the &s;ame
manner they draw out by lot another ball, and &s;o a
third, fourth and fifth, calling up the benches in or|der,
till all the Electors are made. Of the bench
that is called fir&s;t, each one in order comes up to one
of the exteriour urns, and draws thereout a ball,
which if it be &s;ilver, he puts it into another urn &s;et
on the floor at the foot of that out of which he drew
it, and returns to his place, having obteined nothing;
but if it be a golden one, he delivers it into the hand
of that Coun&s;ellor who &s;its by that urn, and goes
pre&s;ently to the middle urn, and thence al&s;o draws
out a ball; which if it be &s;ilver, having pre&s;ented
it to the Coun&s;ellor who &s;its before the urn, he re|turns
to his place: but if it be gold, he delivers it
likewi&s;e to the Coun&s;ellor, and is under&s;tood to be
<PB N="162" REF="93">
one of the Electors of the fir&s;t &s;et; and &s;its down on
the bench on which the &s;aid Coun&s;ellor &s;its (which
&s;tands acro&s;s the Dukes tribunal) with his face to|ward
the Duke, that none in the Hall may by any
nod or other &s;ign recommend them&s;elves to him.
Then a Secretary pronounces his name aloud, that
all of his family or near to him by affinity may take
notice of it. There he continues &s;itting till all the
other eight of the fir&s;t &s;et of Electors be in like man|ner
by lot created. And if by chance two of one
family are drawn in the fir&s;t &s;et, the &s;econd of them
is re&s;erved for the &s;econd &s;et or company, and he
that is fir&s;t taken for the &s;econd &s;et comes in his
room into the fir&s;t. And then for that day none of
that family nor any that are of near affinity to him
can come any more to the <HI>Capello,</HI> becau&s;e it is pro|vided
by the Laws, that in all the four &s;ets of Ele|ctors
which make up 36, there &s;hall be no more than
two of the &s;ame family; and that tho&s;e two &s;hall
not be in the &s;ame &s;et, &s;o that the nine that are of
the &s;ame &s;et mu&s;t be of nine &s;everal families. To
the younge&s;t of the nine of this fir&s;t &s;et is by one of
the Secretaries delivered a Schedule &s;ealed by the
public Seal, wherein are written in order all the
Magi&s;trates that are to be that day created. Then
all the nine take an oath, to chu&s;e tho&s;e whom they
&s;hall judge mo&s;t fit to &s;erve the Common-wealth,
and go forth the Council-chamber into a private
room appointed for them. In like manner are the
other three &s;ets of Electors made, who being &s;worn
do likewi&s;e take their Schedules, and withdraw into
their re&s;pective rooms. When all the four &s;ets of
Electors are cho&s;en and withdrawn, then any of the
Gentlemen in the Council-chamber may change his
bench as he plea&s;es. [<HI>NB.</HI> When there are only &s;uch
Magi&s;tracies to be di&s;po&s;ed of as can have but two
Competitors, there are but two &s;ets of Electors
made.] When the fir&s;t &s;et is withdrawn, they &s;it
<PB N="163" REF="93">
down, taking place according to their age. Then
a Secretary appointed for that purpo&s;e reads to them
the laws and con&s;titutions which they are obliged
to ob&s;erve in the choice of Magi&s;trates: after which
he puts into an urn nine balls, marked with the nine
numeral characters or figures, and each Elector ac|cording
to his age draws out one till they be all
drawn out. He that draws the ball marked 1, is
under&s;tood to have the nomination of the Competi|tor
for the fir&s;t Magi&s;trates place &s;et down in the
Schedule, and he who draws that marked 2, to have
the nomination of the &s;econd, and &s;o in order of
the re&s;t. When there are eleven Magi&s;trates to be
made in a day, he that hath the nomination of the
fir&s;t, nominates al&s;o the tenth, and he that hath
the &s;econd the eleventh. [<HI>NB.</HI> One of the&s;e Ele|ctors
may nominate him&s;elf to any Office: they
may al&s;o change their Votes among them&s;elves, as
for example, he that hath the nomination of the
Competitor for the fir&s;t place may change with him
who hath the nomination for the &s;econd or third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and &s;o of any other.] He then who hath by lot
obteined the nomination of a Competitor for the
fir&s;t Magi&s;trate, names one whom he plea&s;es, who
is balloted among the nine, and if he hath two thirds
of the &s;uffrages, he is under&s;tood to be elected; if
not, he names a &s;econd and &s;o a third, till he comes
to propound one that gets two thirds. His name
that is &s;o approved is by the Secretary &s;et down in
the Schedule under the name of that place to which
he is nominated, with the name of him who pro|pounded
him, and the &s;et of Electors he was of; be|cau&s;e
if the nominated be to a place wherein he is
entru&s;ted with the management of public moneys,
he that nominates is &s;urety for him, and is to make
good what he defrauds the Common-wealth of.
Then he that hath the &s;econd voice names his man,
who is balloted and approved in like manner, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="164" REF="94">
The &s;ame order of nomination and approbation is
ob&s;erved in the other three &s;ets of Electors. Only
in the third and fourth &s;ets when there are &s;ome of
tho&s;e places to be di&s;po&s;ed of which can have but
two Competitors, its nece&s;&s;ary that &s;ome of the
Electors, to who&s;e lot the nomination to &s;uch pla|ces
falls, nominate not at all; becau&s;e the Compe|titors
to &s;uch places are already nominated and ap|proved
in the two fir&s;t &s;ets. Yet is not their being
Electors altogether u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, becau&s;e
they have power to ballot tho&s;e that are nominated
by the other Electors. If any difficulty ari&s;es
among the Electors about any per&s;on nominated,
<HI>v. g.</HI> whether he may be balloted or the like, one of
the <HI>Auvogadors</HI> and one of the <HI>Capi de Dieci</HI> go
into the room where tho&s;e Electors are and deter|min
it.</P>
<P>The Competitors being in this manner cho&s;en,
none of the Electors returns any more into the
Council-chamber, unle&s;s he be one of the Coun&s;el|lors,
or one of the <HI>Capi di Dieci,</HI> or of the <HI>Auvoga|dors,</HI>
or of the Cen&s;ors. The Secretaries then of
the &s;everal companies of Electors pre&s;ent to the
Great Chancellor the Schedules in which are written
the Magi&s;trates to be elected, and under every one
the Competitors, for it. Now it may happen that
one and the &s;ame Gentleman may be cho&s;en Com|petitor
for a Magi&s;tracy by two or three or all four
of the &s;ets of Electors, and then though he hath
no Competitor he may be balloted, becau&s;e he is
under&s;tood to be Competitor to him&s;elf. But if for
one place there be cho&s;en in each of the &s;ets a Com|petitor,
then they look fir&s;t whether he be not un|capable
of &s;uch a place, either by rea&s;on he hath
had &s;ome Magi&s;tracy lately, and the time not yet
expired that is required by the law before he be ca|pable
of another, or becau&s;e &s;ome of his kinred is
in an incompatible place; or bacau&s;e he is indebted
<PB N="165" REF="94">
to the public or the like. Now if of four Compe|titors
three are found uncapable, the fourth remain|ing
without a Competitor cannot be balloted. But
if one be elected in two &s;ets and his two Competi|tors
uncapable of &s;tanding, yet may he be balloted,
for the rea&s;on before alleged.</P>
<P>The Great Chancellor having received the Sche|dules,
reads aloud the names of all the Magi&s;trates
places with their Competitors; and then beginning
from the fir&s;t he propounds the Competitors for
that, and fir&s;t him that was nominated by the fir&s;t
&s;et, and if he were nominated by any other of the
&s;ets, he mentions that al&s;o. And when he hath
read the names of all the Competitors for one place,
they all that are nominated and all of their family
and near affinity go out of the Council-chamber into
a private room, where they &s;tay till they have been
all balloted, and the &s;econd place propounded with
its Competitors; and then they return again and
ballot. As &s;oon as they are withdrawn, the Great
Chancellor with a loud voice -puts all in mind, that
both by the Divine and humane law every one is
obliged to favour him whom he judges to be be&s;t of
all and fitte&s;t to &s;erve the Common-wealth in &s;uch
place as they &s;hall chu&s;e him to. Then he nominates
the fir&s;t Competitor, and little boys appointed for
that purpo&s;e (having fir&s;t delivered to every Gentle|man
a ball) run about the chamber with balloting
boxes in their hands to gather the &s;uffrages. The
balls are made of linen that they may make no noi&s;e
when they fall into the boxes. The boxes are made
double, the one painted white, the other green.
The white is marked with <HI>Si,</HI> i. e. Yea, into which
they that accept put their balls; and the green with
<HI>No,</HI> into which they that refu&s;e the party propound|ed
put theirs. The boxes are made in that manner
with a hole in the &s;ide to thru&s;t in the hand, that no
man can &s;ee into which box you let fall the ball.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="95">
The&s;e little boys as they go along gathering the balls,
repete &s;till aloud the name of the per&s;on that is then
balloted. When they have gathered up the balls,
they carry them to the Dukes tribunal, and put the
<HI>Yea's</HI> in a white ve&s;&s;el there &s;tanding, and the <HI>No's</HI>
in a green. The Affirmative or <HI>Yea's</HI> are told over
by the Coun&s;ellors &s;itting on the right hand of the
Duke, and the Negative or <HI>No's</HI> by them &s;itting on
the left; and if the <HI>Si's</HI> are le&s;s than half the whole
number of &s;uffrages, &s;uch a per&s;on hath lo&s;t it; but
if they be more he may obtein it; and therefore the
number by which it exceeds the half is &s;et down. In
the mean time the other Competitors are named and
balloted in like manner, and at la&s;t he who&s;e affir|mative
&s;uffrages or <HI>Si's</HI> exceed the half by the greater
number, is under&s;tood to be cho&s;en to that place. The
like method of proceeding is ob&s;erved in the choice
of the &s;econd, third and all the re&s;t of the Magi|&s;trates
for that day. When the balloting and coun|ting
is done, the Great Chancellor gives notice who
are elected, commanding them to pre&s;ent them&s;elves
before the Cen&s;ors, who take an oath of them that
they have not done any thing contrary to the laws to
obtein tho&s;e places; which done the Council is di&s;|mi&s;t.
<HI>NB.</HI> If none of the Competitors for any place
have above half the number of &s;uffrages, there is none
as yet under&s;tood to be cho&s;en to that place. And be|cau&s;e
by an antient Law the Great Council is to break
up before Sun-&s;et, if it happens any of the Competi|tors
are not before that time come to the ballot, the
names of &s;uch Magi&s;trates and Officers as are cho&s;en
are read, and they that remain to be balloted lo&s;e the
benefit of their nomination, becau&s;e the next Coun|cil-day
all is begun anew and there are other Compe|titors
made. It is permitted to any &s;tranger to be
pre&s;ent at the meetings of the Great Council (as we
were &s;everal times) to &s;ee the manner of proceeding
there, and there is a particular bench appointed for
them to &s;it on.</P>

<HEAD>Of the PREGADI.</HEAD>
<P>In the Council of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> are debated and de|termined
all the great and weighty affairs of the
Common-wealth. This Council in former times
con&s;i&s;ted of no more than 60. Afterwards they
began to add thereto &s;ometimes 25, &s;ometimes 20,
in&s;omuch that it was at la&s;t concluded, that there
&s;hould be made an addition to it (<HI>Aggiunta</HI> they call
it) of as many more. The cau&s;e of &s;uch additions
was, I &s;uppo&s;e, the greatne&s;s and importance of
the affairs then to be con&s;idered and treated of, that
&s;o a greater number of Gentlemen being pre&s;ent at
&s;uch con&s;ultations and debates, matters might be
better di&s;puted, and more throughly &s;canned and ex|amined.
In the number of the 60 <HI>Pregadi</HI> there can
be but three of one and the &s;ame family, and if there
be three in the <HI>Pregadi</HI> there can be but two in the
<HI>Giunta;</HI> if there but two in the <HI>Pregadi</HI> there may
then be three in the <HI>Giunta.</HI> Be&s;ides the 120 we
have mentioned, this Council takes in al&s;o many
other Councils and Magi&s;trates, whereof &s;ome have
&s;uffrages and &s;ome have not, only to add reputation
to them, they are permitted to be pre&s;ent, to hear
the debates and under&s;tand the affairs of the Com|mon-wealth.

<P>The <HI>Pregadi</HI> were &s;o called, as &s;ome think, be|cau&s;e
anciently they were a&s;&s;embled by public Mi|ni&s;ters,
and by them as it were prayed and entreated
that they would come and con&s;ult of the affairs of
the Commonwealth. The <HI>Pregadi</HI> properly &s;o called
are cho&s;en by the Gr. Council, as the other Magi|&s;trates
are, in the manner before related. They be|gin
&s;o &s;oon to chu&s;e them that all of them may be
elected by the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> at which time
they enter upon their Office. The <HI>Giunta</HI> or other 60
are cho&s;en both by the Council of the old <HI>Pregadi</HI> and
the Great Council in this manner. Upon <HI>Michaelmas</HI>
day the Council of the old <HI>Pregadi</HI> is a&s;&s;embled,
wherein each one of tho&s;e that have &s;uffrages nomi|nates
the per&s;on whom he would have to be of the
<HI>Giunta.</HI> All the nominated are written down. The
next day the Great Council is convened, and the
names of all the per&s;ons nominated by the <HI>Pregadi</HI>
having been fir&s;t read, are put into an urn, and thence
one by one drawn out be one of the Secretaries, and
balloted by the Council; and he that obtains above
half of the &s;uffrages is reckoned to be one of the
<HI>Giunta.</HI> The other Magi&s;trates comprehended in this
Council, it matters not at what time they be created;
<PB N="170" REF="97">
becau&s;e when the <HI>Pregadi</HI> enter upon their admini|&s;tration,
tho&s;e who at pre&s;ent exerci&s;e &s;uch offices
are numbred among them as members of the Coun|cil;
and if their offices determine before the <HI>Prega|di</HI>'s,
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ours enter in their places. Be&s;ides
tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;t the Commonwealth in a time of
need with their e&s;tates, lending &s;uch a &s;um of mony
as the Law determines, have liberty granted them to
be pre&s;ent in this Council, and to under&s;tand the
management of public affairs (yet without power
of balloting) till &s;uch time as their moneys be repaid,
and &s;ometimes longer. For the Law pre&s;cribes them
&s;uch a time to enjoy this honour, though their mony
be repaid them before. By this con&s;titution the Com|monwealth
reaps a double benefit. Fir&s;t, it &s;eldom
wants mony upon any exigent, many being willing
to lend, that they may enjoy this privilege. Secondly,
it trains up young men to the knowledge of State-affairs,
and qualifies and enables them to manage
public bu&s;ine&s;s when they &s;hall be thereto called.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pregadi</HI> are a&s;&s;embled as often as it plea&s;es the
<HI>College.</HI> A Council is al&s;o granted to the Magi&s;trates
when they would confirm any Law, and to the <HI>Au|vogadors,</HI>
when they have any difficult ca&s;e to bring
in to be determined. The time of their meeting is
&s;ignified by the tolling of a Bell; it is al&s;o a cu&s;tom
to &s;end to give notice and invite them by public Ser|jeants
or Mini&s;ters. They cannot enter into any con|&s;ultation
about public bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s there be pre|&s;ent
four of the Coun&s;ellours, and 60 at lea&s;t of &s;uch
as have &s;uffrages. In this Council are con&s;ultations
had, and re&s;olutions taken about Peace and War,
truces and agreements, and ways of providing mo|ney
for the nece&s;&s;ities and u&s;es of the Commonwealth.
How the&s;e affairs are treated of will appear when we
&s;hall come to &s;peak of the College. Laws are al&s;o
confirmed in this Council, which are fir&s;t con&s;idered
by tho&s;e Magi&s;trates, who are over that bu&s;ine&s;s to
<PB N="171" REF="97">
which &s;uch Laws appertain, Such Magi&s;trates come
fir&s;t to the College, and there &s;hew either the nece&s;&s;i|ty
or the benefit and utility of &s;uch Laws as they
would introduce; and if the College approves of
them, then they are permitted to bring them into the
Council of <HI>Pregadi;</HI> and if they pa&s;s there, then are
they valid, and publi&s;hed by public <HI>bando</HI> or Pro|clamation;
after which every one is obliged to take
notice of them and ob&s;erve them: and the Magi|&s;trate
that introduced them is to &s;ee that they be put
in execution. They u&s;e al&s;o &s;ometimes to get their
laws confirmed, not only in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI>
but al&s;o in the Great Council. The which thing (&s;aith
my Author) is I &s;uppo&s;e principally in the power of
him who brings in the Law to do, and is u&s;ually done
to gain more reputation, and add &s;trength to the
Law. Be&s;ides in the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> is cho&s;en a
Captain of the <HI>Armata,</HI> in ca&s;e the Commonwealth
hath occa&s;ion to make war by Sea; and a Provedi|tor
of the Camp when they make war by Land: tho&s;e
three kinds of Magi&s;trates, which they call, <HI>i. e.
Savi grandi, Savi di Terra ferma &amp; Savi di mare:</HI>
which elections are made after this manner. Each
one of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> nominates one whom he plea&s;es.
All that are &s;o nominated are balloted, and he that
obtains more then half the number of &s;uffrages is
under&s;tood to be cho&s;en to that office or dignity. But
becau&s;e it may often happen that he who is judged
fitte&s;t for &s;uch or &s;uch an office may be known to be
unwilling to accept it, and no man for fear of di&s;|plea&s;ing
him may dare publicly to nominate him;
therefore to avoid that inconvenience, each of the
<HI>Pregadi</HI> writes down in a paper the name of him
whom he would chu&s;e to &s;uch a place; which Scrolls
are all together put into an urn, and drawn out by
the Great Chancellor one by one; and the names
written therein being openly read, they are put to
the ballot, and on him who hath more then half the
<PB N="172" REF="98">
&s;uffrages is &s;uch Office or Dignity conferred. But
when there is a Captain of the <HI>Armata</HI> to be made,
he that is in this manner cho&s;en in the Council of
<HI>Pregadi</HI> mu&s;t be afterwards ballotted in the <HI>Great
Council,</HI> and have Competitors given him by the
four &s;ets of Electors in manner before related, and
he who hath mo&s;t &s;uffrages above the half is under|&s;tood
to be elected. The Coun&s;ellours al&s;o, and the
Cen&s;ors are elected partly by the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI>
and partly by the Great Council.</P>

<HEAD>Of the COLLEGE.</HEAD>
<P>The College is the third member of the Com|monwealth,
and of great reputation. It is made up
principally of three &s;ets or kinds of Magi&s;trates.
Fir&s;t tho&s;e they call <HI>Savi grande.</HI> 2. Tho&s;e they call
<HI>Savi di terra ferma.</HI> And 3. tho&s;e they call <HI>Savi di
mare.</HI> The number of the <HI>Savi grandi</HI> is &s;ix; of
each of the other, five; in all &s;ixteen. And be&s;ides
the&s;e of the <HI>Signoria,</HI> that is the Duke, the &s;ix Coun|&s;ellors,
and the three heads or chiefs of the 40 Crimi|nal
Judges, called <HI>Capi di Quaranta.</HI> The <HI>Savi</HI> of
the Sea, who are otherwi&s;e called <HI>Savi &agrave; gli ordini,</HI>
take care of all maritime affairs, as well &s;uch as con|cern
peace and war as other matters. The <HI>Savi</HI> of the
Land manage and govern Land affairs, &s;uch as ap|pertain
to peace and war, and their e&s;pecial charge is
to keep account of all Souldiers that are in the Com|monwealths
pay. The <HI>Savi grandi</HI> over-&s;ee and take
care of both, as well at home as abroad. And their
particular charge is to make provi&s;ion both for Peace
and war, to write to and an&s;wer Princes Letters,
and finally to coun&s;el and govern the whole Com|monwealth.
It is to be noted that anciently the <HI>Sa|vi
grandi</HI> did include the authority and admini&s;tration
of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, whence the <HI>Savi grandi</HI>
might intermeddle with the affairs belonging to the
<PB N="173" REF="98">
Land, though not excluding the <HI>Savi</HI> of the <HI>Land.</HI>
In the &s;ame manner the <HI>Savi</HI> of the land included
tho&s;e of the Sea, but were not included by them, and
therefore with the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea could take into
their con&s;ideration Sea-affa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rs. So that the <HI>Savi
grandi</HI> included both the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, and the
<HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea; the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land only tho&s;e
of the Sea. But in our times, and not many
years &s;ince the way of managing &s;uch affairs is a lit|tle
altered. For that by Law it is determined, that
the Authority and admini&s;tration of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the
land &s;hall be equal to that of the Grand <HI>Savi;</HI> only
that of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea remains in the &s;ame terms
it was. In old time there were no other then the
Grand <HI>Savi;</HI> afterward the naval power and com|mand
at Sea being encrea&s;ed, it was found nece&s;&s;ary
to create a Council for Sea affairs or <HI>Savi di mare.</HI>
The like happened afterward when the Republic
began to grow great on the Land, the Senate being
con&s;trained to create <HI>Savi di terra ferma,</HI> which was
pre&s;ently after that <HI>Trevi&s;o</HI> came under their domini|on.
Anciently the <HI>Savi di mare</HI> were of greater re|putation
then tho&s;e of the <HI>terra ferma,</HI> but after
that the Dominion of the Commonwealth began to
encrea&s;e upon the Land, they bent their coun&s;els and
endeavours that way, and &s;o the <HI>Savi di mare</HI> lo&s;t their
reputation, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Terra ferma</HI> gained it.
The&s;e three kinds of Magi&s;trates are cho&s;en by the
Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> in the &s;ame manner as the Pro|veditor
of the Camp. None can be made <HI>Savio
grande</HI> unle&s;s he be of mature age, and reputed of
the greate&s;t abilities. The <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land are al|ways
men of reputation for prudence, but not &s;o great
as the <HI>Savi grandi;</HI> the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea are &s;till of le&s;s
e&s;teem then they. And at pre&s;ent this Magi&s;tracy
&s;erves rather to give young men occa&s;ion to exerci&s;e
them&s;elves in State-bu&s;ine&s;s, then for any other pur|po&s;e,
becau&s;e in matters of moment the <HI>Savi grandi,</HI>
<PB N="174" REF="99">
and <HI>Savi di terra ferma</HI> are always employed. Each
of the&s;e companies of Magi&s;trates chu&s;e one of them|&s;elves
<HI>Praepo&s;itus,</HI> or Prevo&s;t, who is chief of that
Magi&s;tracy for one week; he propounds matters in
the College and Records tho&s;e things which are to
be executed which appertain to his Magi&s;tracy. The
manner of proceeding and tran&s;acting public af|fairs
in the <HI>College</HI> is this. Every morning two hours
after Sun-ri&s;ing the <HI>College</HI> is convened. [<HI>N. B.</HI>
whenever we &s;peak of the <HI>College</HI> we under&s;tand the
three Societies of Magi&s;trates before-mentioned, to|gether
with the Duke, the Coun&s;ellors, and the three
<HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> that is with the <HI>Signoria,</HI> who
have their places not only in this <HI>College,</HI> but al&s;o in
the Grand Council, the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> and the
Council of ten: So that nothing is debated without
their pre&s;ence and intervention.] The <HI>College</HI> being
a&s;&s;embled, all tho&s;e Letters are read that were re|ceived
&s;ince their la&s;t meeting: Audience is given to
publick Oratours and Emba&s;&s;adours, if any require
it; and each of the three Societies of <HI>Savi</HI> di&s;patch
&s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s as appertains to them, and was pro|pounded
and recorded by their <HI>Provo&s;t.</HI> If therefore
there be any bu&s;ine&s;s to be debated appertaining to
the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI> the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, and of the
Sea may be excluded: but if it be not of very great
importance, they do not u&s;e to prohibit them to be
pre&s;ent at &s;uch deliberations, but their part is only
to hear and hold their peace: or if they do deliver
their opinions, yet are they not noted down to be
brought into the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but only the
opinions of the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI> the Coun&s;ellors, the
<HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> and the Duke. And to the end
that the whole method and order of this admini&s;tra|tion
may be the better under&s;tood by an example,
let us &s;uppo&s;e there is a con&s;ultation to be had about
&s;ome affairs appertaining to the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea, they
cannot exclude the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, and the <HI>Grand
<PB N="175" REF="99">
Savi,</HI> if they plea&s;e to interpo&s;e and meddle with
that affair. After con&s;ultation had thereupon, not on|ly
the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea, but they of the Land, and
the <HI>Grand Savi,</HI> the Duke al&s;o and the Coun&s;ellors
and <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> may deliver their opinions if
they plea&s;e, and according as they are of one or
more different opinions, make one or &s;everal par|ties
[by parties we mean nothing but propo&s;itions
or &s;entences.] For that each <HI>Savio</HI> and Coun&s;ellour,
much more the Duke, when they do not agree to the
opinions of others, may each bring in a party (that
is, propound his &s;entence or judgment about a bu&s;i|ne&s;s)
alone. All the&s;e parties are noted by a Secreta|ry,
each one with the name of that <HI>Savio</HI> or other
per&s;on that was the Author of it. And becau&s;e no
matter belonging to the public admini&s;tration can
be determined without the approbation and con&s;ent
of the Council of <HI>Pregadi;</HI> therefore that Council
being a&s;&s;embled, the afore&s;aid Magi&s;trates come with
their parties or propo&s;itions noted, and propound
them in order. If the parties be more then one (as
&s;uppo&s;e four) they are all propounded together, but
that is fir&s;t read the Author whereof is the more ho|nourable
Magi&s;trate, and therefore tho&s;e of the
Duke and Coun&s;ellors ought to precede the re&s;t,
tho&s;e of the <HI>Savi grandi,</HI> them of the <HI>Savi</HI> of the
Land; and theirs tho&s;e of the <HI>Savi di mare.</HI> And if
any of the three Societies of <HI>Savi</HI> in matters apper|taining
to their charge have taken &s;everal parties,
that party ought fir&s;t to be propounded, of which
he is Authour, who in that Society is mo&s;t honor|able.
The parties being propounded, if any of the
<HI>Savi</HI> will &s;peak again&s;t them, he ought to precede
the re&s;t of the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and among them fir&s;t that
<HI>Savio</HI> who is of greate&s;t Authority. After that any
of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> hath liberty to do the &s;ame. After &s;uf|ficient
debate upon all the parties, they are all balloted
together in this manner. Suppo&s;e the parties to be
<PB N="176" REF="100">
four, then there are four Secretaries come in, having
each a white box in his hand: after them another
Secretary follows with a green box, and after him
&s;till another with a red box. The fir&s;t of the four
goes from per&s;on to per&s;on, repeating the name of
him that was author of the party fir&s;t propounded:
the &s;econd, third, and fourth in like manner repeat|ing
the names of the &s;econd, third, and fourth, and
each one of the <HI>Pregadi</HI> puts his ballot into what box
he plea&s;es. So that if he approves not the fir&s;t party,
he puts his ballot in his box that gathers the &s;uffra|ges
for that party that plea&s;es him. If he approves
none of the four, then he puts his ballot in the green
box: but if the matter be not yet clear to him, and
he be not fully &s;atisfied about it, he puts his ballot in|to
the red box that comes la&s;t, and is called the box of
the <HI>Non &s;inceri,</HI> i. e. &s;uch as neither approve or re|ject.
The Suffrages being thus gathered, the ballots
of each party are told over, and that which exceeds
the half by mo&s;t &s;uffrages is under&s;tood to be confir|med
and ratified; but if none come up to the half,
then that which hath the lea&s;t number of &s;uffrages
being laid a&s;ide, the other three are balloted after the
&s;ame manner, with three boxes, and after them a
green and a red one. If none of the three get half
the number of &s;uffrages, then that which hath fewe&s;t
being again laid a&s;ide, the remaining two are ballo|ted
in like manner; and if neither of the&s;e pa&s;&s;eth
the half, then that which hath the mo&s;t &s;uffrages is
balloted alone: and if the &s;uffrages for that exceed
not the half, none of the parties balloted is under|&s;tood
to be confirmed: in which ca&s;e new parties
mu&s;t be brought in, if the matter treated of be ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
which may be done the &s;ame day, becau&s;e
the Duke, any one of the Coun&s;ellors, <HI>Capi di Qua|ranta,</HI>
or <HI>Savi</HI> may bring in new parties. Such a bu|&s;ine&s;s
may al&s;o be referred to another day. But it &s;el|dom
happens that of &s;o many parties no one is ap|proved.
<PB N="177" REF="100">
When none of them is confirmed, and the
matter requires further debate, we &s;hall declare what
order is taken when we come to treat of the Council
of Ten. But it is to be noted, that the fir&s;t time all
the parties are balloted together, it may happen that
there are more then half the &s;uffrages in the box of
the <HI>Non-&s;inceri,</HI> i. e. &s;uch as &s;u&s;pend, being not clear
in the point; and in &s;uch ca&s;e none of the parties
can be balloted, but the matter requiring new debate,
new parties are to be brought in. And becau&s;e it may
happen that &s;ome one of the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> may
have upon &s;ome matter under con&s;ideration a propo|&s;ition
to make, which may be for the benefit and ad|vantage
of the Commonwealth, which came not in|to
the minds of the <HI>Savi</HI> or others who have power
of propounding their judgments or opinions in
Council, that &s;uch advantage be not lo&s;t, it is or|dained
that &s;uch opinion or &s;entiment be communi|cated
to one of tho&s;e who have power to propound,
and by him propounded to the Council. But that
none but the <HI>Savi</HI> and others before-mentioned
&s;hould have liberty to bring in parties, is ordained to
avoid prolixity and confu&s;ion; it being al&s;o unlikely
that what comes not into the thoughts and con&s;ide|ration
of the College, in which are the wi&s;e&s;t per|&s;ons
of the City, &s;hould be imagined or found out
by other men. But granting this might &s;ometimes
happen, yet it would be &s;o &s;eldom, that no great ac|count
ought to be made of it; and &s;o much the ra|ther,
becau&s;e in every con&s;titution the le&s;&s;er conve|nience
ought to give place to the greater. To every
of the&s;e three Societies of <HI>Savi,</HI> the &s;ame time of
&s;ix months determines their office: but yet are not
all the per&s;ons in each cho&s;en at the &s;ame time. For
the grand <HI>Savi</HI> are cho&s;en at two &s;everal times, three
at once; and from the choice of the fir&s;t to the choice
of the &s;econd intercedes three months time. The <HI>Savi</HI>
of the Land, and the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Sea are al&s;o cho&s;en at
<PB N="178" REF="101">
two times, three the fir&s;t time, and two the &s;econd;
with the &s;ame interval between. To the grand <HI>Savi</HI>
there is &s;ometimes, great affairs requiring it, added an
<HI>Aggiunta</HI> of three more, and the&s;e we call <HI>Savi &s;traor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dinarii.</HI>
One may be cho&s;en into the Council of <HI>Pre|gadi</HI>

who being clothed with Scarlet, accompany

this they continue to do for three days. Then is the
Funeral celebrated with all the Pomp and Magnifi|cence
which the Dignity of &s;uch a Magi&s;trate re|quires.
The next day after the Funeral the Great
Council is convened, and given to under&s;tand by the
Great Chancellor, that being to give beginning to
the Election of a new Duke, they are fir&s;t to make
choice of five Correctors and three Inqui&s;itors. The
Vice-Duke then &s;tanding up, makes a Speech to the
Council, and having commended the Life, Behavi|our,
and Government of the Duke decea&s;ed, exhorts
and &s;tirs up every one to make choice of a per&s;on to
&s;ucceed him, that may be u&s;eful and honourable to

proceed to elect the &s;aid five Correctors and three
Inqui&s;itors after the &s;ame manner they u&s;e in the

is diligently to examine the life and actions of
the decea&s;ed Prince, and if they find that he hath in
any thing erred or done ami&s;s, they are obliged to
accu&s;e him; and look what puni&s;hment he hath de|&s;erved
is inflicted on his heirs. But &s;uch puni&s;hments
are never corporal, but only pecuniary mulcts. And
&s;uch a Cau&s;e, by rea&s;on it is a bu&s;ine&s;s of great im|portance,
is not finally determined by the Inqui&s;i|tors,
but agitated in the Great Council, and may
al&s;o be examined in the <HI>Quarantia criminale.</HI> The&s;e
Inqui&s;itors have a years time to fini&s;h their Inqui&s;iti|on in.
The office of the Correctors is to &s;ee and

&s;ucceeding Prince is needful to be introduced: and if
there have been any error di&s;covered in the admini|&s;tration
<PB N="180" REF="103">
of the Precedent Duke that ought to be cor|rected.
For the doing of which &s;o &s;oon as they are
created they are brought into a certain Chamber,
where they meet &s;o often till they be agreed upon
what to them &s;eems needful to be amended, or &s;it to
be newly introduced; and this commonly takes up
three or four days. When they have fini&s;hed their
con&s;iderations, they therewith acquaint the <HI>Signoria,</HI>
who cau&s;e the Great Council to be convened, in the
accu&s;tomed place and manner; whither the &s;aid Cor|rectors
come, and there cau&s;e all &s;uch Laws and Cor|rections
as they judge fit to be made, to be publicly
recited; which being balloted one by one in the
great Council, are either confirmed or rejected. This
done, the Great Council the day following is again
called, to which meeting none can come but &s;uch as
have pa&s;&s;ed the 30 year of their age. The doors being
&s;hut at the appointed time, all that are pre&s;ent in
Council are numbred over, and in an urn or <HI>Capello</HI>
of that &s;ort which have but one hole in their cover,
are put 30 golden balls, marked with a certain note,
and as many &s;ilver ones as together with the golden
are equal to the number of the Gentlemen pre&s;ent.
After this the junior Coun&s;ellor goes out into St.
<HI>Marks</HI> Church, which is fa&s;t by, and having made
his reverence to the Altar, takes a little boy which he
finds there, and brings him along with him into the
Council; who is to draw the ballots out of the urn
for the Gentlemen who they come up to the <HI>Capello,</HI>
they not being permitted to draw them out them|&s;elves,

and is he that in proce&s;&s;ions goes before the
<HI>Duke,</HI> who is bound &s;o &s;oon as the boy comes to be
of convenient age to make him one of the Secreta|ries.
The <HI>Ballotine</HI> being brought in before the <HI>Sig|noria,</HI>
one Coun&s;ellor and one <HI>Capo de Quaranta</HI> cho|&s;en

out as before, and the benches come up accordingly.]
If one of tho&s;e five benches on the &s;ide towards St.
<HI>Georges</HI> be drawn, they are to begin to come up at
that end that is toward the <HI>Broil;</HI> and if one of tho&s;e

end of the bench which is to begin, ari&s;es and goes
up to the <HI>Capello.</HI> Then the <HI>Ballotine</HI> in his name draws
out a ball, which if it be a &s;ilver one, he puts it in
another <HI>Capello</HI> &s;tanding at the foot of that out of
which he drew it, and he for whom it was drawn
goes pre&s;ently out of the Council-chamber. But if
it be gilded and marked, he delivers it to the Coun|&s;ellor
&s;itting by, and the Great Chancellor pronoun|ces
aloud the name of him for whom it was drawn:
who pre&s;ently between two Secretaries is carried into
a room out of the Council Chamber. Then all
tho&s;e who are of his Family, his Uncles, Cou&s;ins,
Father-in-law, and they that are of near affinity to
him are called, and being come up to the Tribunal,
numbred by one of the Secretaries, and &s;o many
&s;ilver balls taken out of the <HI>Capello</HI> as are equal to
the &s;um of them, and &s;o they depart the Coun|cil-chamber.
In the &s;ame order all the re&s;t of the
benches are called by lot, till all the golden balls are
drawn out of the <HI>Capello.</HI> And after tho&s;e who have
obtained them are withdrawn into the fore-mention|ed
room the Council is di&s;mi&s;t: and the 30 come all
before the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and &s;it down on two benches
there &s;tanding, half on the one, and half on the
other. Then in a certain <HI>Capello</HI> there placed are
put 21 &s;ilver Balls and 9 golden; and the&s;e 30 per|&s;ons
being called according to the order they were
<PB N="182" REF="104">
cho&s;en in, come up one by one to the <HI>Capello,</HI> and the
<HI>Ballotine</HI> draws out a ballot for each one, till all the
golden balls are drawn. Tho&s;e then for whom the
&s;ilver balls were drawn depart, and tho&s;e nine who
obtained the golden withdraw into the fore-menti|oned
room; where when they are all come together
they are by the <HI>Signoria</HI> conducted into another
room, where are &s;et ready all nece&s;&s;ary accommoda|tions
for them: and having given oath to make a
good election, they continue there locked up toge|ther
till they have cho&s;en 40 of 40 different Families:
in which election they thus proceed. So &s;oon as they
are &s;hut up they draw lots among them&s;elves, who
&s;hall nominate fir&s;t, who &s;econd, who third, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
accordingly in that order nominate. Tho&s;e nomi|nated
are balloted among the nine, and if they have
&s;even &s;uffrages they are under&s;tood to be of the 40.
The election being fini&s;hed, they &s;ignifie &s;o much to
the <HI>Signoria.</HI> The which the &s;ame day, or if it be
too late the day following, cau&s;e the Great Council
to be called; which when it is a&s;&s;embled, the Great
Chancellor with two Secretaries goes to the nine for
the Schedule in which the 40 Electors are written;
and returning therewith into the Council by the
command of the <HI>Signoria</HI> reads over the names of
them that are cho&s;en; who one by one coming before
the Tribunal are &s;ent out of the Council into a cer|tain
Chamber; and if any one of the 40 happens not
to be pre&s;ent in Council, one of the Coun&s;ellors and
one <HI>Capo de Quaranta</HI> go to &s;earch him out, and with|out
giving him leave to &s;peak to any body, bring
him into the Council-chamber, and afterwards into
the room where his companions are withdrawn.
When the 40 are all met together the Council is
di&s;mi&s;t, and then after the manner of the former 30,
the&s;e 40 come before the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and being &s;et up|on
the two benches in the middle, they are likewi&s;e
by lot called up to the <HI>Capello,</HI> wherein are put 28
<PB N="183" REF="104">
&s;ilver balls, and 12 golden. Tho&s;e for whom the &s;il|ver
balls are drawn depart the Hall; and tho&s;e for
whom the golden are brought by the <HI>Signoria</HI> either
into the Chamber where the former nine were, or in|to
another as they plea&s;e; where having taken oath
to make a good election, they are locked up, and by
way of &s;uffrage chu&s;e 25 of 25 &s;everal Families, in
the &s;ame manner as the nine cho&s;e the 40; to which
Election 9 &s;uffrages of the 12 are nece&s;&s;ary. The
Election being made, they acquaint the <HI>Signoria</HI>
therewith; which if the time permits, cau&s;es the
great Council to be a&s;&s;embled the &s;ame day; if not,
the day following, and after the &s;ame manner the
Great Chancellor reads the names of the 25: and
tho&s;e that are cho&s;en when they hear their names
read, come up to the Tribnnal, and are &s;ent out of
the Council into a room by them&s;elves as were the
40: and if any one be not pre&s;ent, he is &s;earched
out and brought in like wi&s;e. When all the 25 are
met, the Council is broken up, and the 25 come be|fore
the <HI>Signoria,</HI> and &s;itting down, are called by
lot, and come up to the <HI>Capello,</HI> into which are put
16 &s;ilver balls, and nine golden. Tho&s;e for whom
the <HI>Ballotine</HI> draws the &s;ilver balls depart; tho&s;e that
get the golden remain; and being lockt up together,
they do in the &s;ame manner as the former 12, by 7
&s;uffrages chu&s;e 45 of 45 &s;everal Families; who after|wards
being called by the <HI>Signoria</HI> into the Great
Council, the pre&s;ent and ab&s;ent being all come to|gether,
as we &s;aid before, the Council is di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.
And the 45 being &s;et before the <HI>Signoria</HI> in form a|fore&s;aid,
and called by lot, come up to the <HI>Capello;</HI>
into which are put 34 &s;ilver balls, and 11 golden.
Tho&s;e for whom the &s;ilver balls are drawn go at their
plea&s;ure, tho&s;e for whom the golden, remain; and
having given oath to make a good Election, they are
&s;hut up as the former, and by way of &s;uffrage chu&s;e
41 of &s;o many &s;everal Families, of whom each mu&s;t
<PB N="184" REF="105">
have 9 ballots, and the&s;e are the Electors of the
<HI>Duke.</HI> After the&s;e 41 are thus elected, and in the
Great Council pronounced, and al&s;o all met in the
room appointed, in manner afore&s;aid; fir&s;t of all
the Ma&s;s of the Holy Gho&s;t is celebrated, then eve|ry
one of the Electors promi&s;es by &s;olemn oath to
lay a&s;ide all humane pa&s;&s;ions, and to chu&s;e for <HI>Duke</HI>
him whom to chu&s;e in his con&s;cience he &s;hall judge
to be mo&s;t for the intere&s;t and honour of the Com|monwealth,
as like to do it mo&s;t credit and be&s;t &s;er|vice;
and that with the profounde&s;t &s;ilence he will
keep &s;ecret whatever is &s;aid or done among them.
After this they are lockt up together alone, without
any other Mini&s;ters or Secretaries, &s;o clo&s;e that no
per&s;on can be admitted to &s;ee them: and fir&s;t of all
among them&s;elves of the anciente&s;t they chu&s;e three
heads or chiefs which they call <HI>Priors;</HI> and al&s;o of the
younge&s;t among them they chu&s;e two who perform
the office of Secretaries. The Priors &s;it down, having
before them a table upon which are placed two bal|loting
boxes of that &s;ort that are u&s;ed in the Great
Council; in one of which are put 40 balls, marked
with a certain mark, that no deceit may be u&s;ed. The
re&s;t of the 41 &s;it al&s;o down, each where he plea&s;es.
The two Secretaries make 41 Schedules, and having
folded them up give to each per&s;on one, they take
al&s;o the ballots and di&s;tribute them to all. Then they
are called one by one before the three Priors, and
each one writes in his Schedule the name of him
whom he would have to be Duke, and leaves it up|on
the table. The two Secretaries note the names of
them that are written in the Schedules, and by how
many each one is named. [The names in all the
Schedules &s;eldom pa&s;s 6 or 8, becau&s;e there are never
more who can be judged &s;it to be promoted
to &s;uch a Dignity.] After which all the names &s;o
noted are put into an urn, and thence by lot drawn
out. And he that is fir&s;t drawn, if he be one of
<PB N="185" REF="105">
the Electors is pre&s;ently &s;ent out into the Chamber
of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI> and there &s;hut up; and liberty is
then given to any one of the Electors to &s;peak any
thing he hath to object again&s;t him, why he is not
fit for &s;o great a place. And if any thing be by any
one objected, it is &s;et down by the Secretaries: and
he being called in, all that hath been &s;poken again&s;t
him is read to him, and if he will &s;tand upon his de|fence
he may make his an&s;wer; which when he hath
done he returns into the &s;ame Chamber again. The
&s;ame order is u&s;ed till there be none left who will ob|ject
any thing again&s;t him, or till he will defend
him&s;elf no longer; after which he is pre&s;ently bal|loted,
and as &s;oon as that is done all the Electors go
up before the Priors, the elde&s;t of which with a lit|tle
&s;taff numbers over tho&s;e that are in the affirma|tive
box, and al&s;o tho&s;e that are in the negative;
and if the affirmative amount to 25, the per&s;on bal|loted
is under&s;tood to be cho&s;en Duke; and there
can be no other balloted. This order hath been &s;ince
changed, and notwith&s;tanding the fir&s;t or any other
have come to 25 &s;uffrages, yet have the re&s;t been bal|loted;
and he that hath obtained mo&s;t &s;uffrages hath
been made Duke. But if the affirmative &s;uffrages
do not amount to 25, there is taken by lot another
out of the urn, in which the names &s;et down each
with the number of its nominators were put, and
the &s;ame order of proceeding ob&s;erved till they come
to one who gets 25 ballots. It may happen that
none comes up to that number, in which ca&s;e the
Electors continue &s;hut up, and name and ballot the
nominated &s;o often, till one comes to get the fore|&s;aid
number of &s;uffrages. The Duke being on this
wi&s;e created, many Ceremonies are wont to be per|formed.
Fir&s;t of all the 41 by the Great Chancel|lor
&s;end word to the <HI>Signoria</HI> who it is that is crea|ted
Duke, who fir&s;t of all go to congratulate him,
and give him joy; and if it be in the day time,
<PB N="186" REF="106">
cau&s;e all the Bells to be rung. Then his Kinred and
Friends come to vi&s;it him, and at the &s;ame time there
is money coined with his name upon it. After
which the 41 Electors with the <HI>Duke</HI> go into St.
<HI>Mark</HI>'s Church, and having done reverence to God,
all mount up a Scaffold, and the anciente&s;t of them
tells the people (who by this time have filled the
Church) that they have cho&s;en a Duke in the room
of the decea&s;ed; and commending the Election,
&s;hews him to the People, who in token of confirma|tion
and joy give him loud acclamations. The Duke
then &s;peaks to the People, and encourages them to
hope well of his Government; which done, they go
down the Scaffold, and bring the Duke before the
Altar; where by the Procurators of the Church an
Oath is tendred him to ob&s;erve the Laws and a
Standard put into his hand by the Vicar of the <HI>Pri|micerius</HI>
of St. <HI>Marks.</HI> After this, having made an
offering at the Altar, he comes to the door of the
Choire, where he is placed upon a little low move|able
Scaffold (<HI>Pergoletta</HI> they call it) accompanied by
one that carries the Standard, and by another of his
near Friends or Relations, who carries a cup full of
gold and &s;ilver money &s;tamped with his name; and
by the mariners of the Ar&s;enal he is drawn out of
St. <HI>Marks,</HI> and carried round about the <HI>Piazza,</HI> he
that carries the cup &s;cattering money among the peo|ple
as he goes along. When he hath rounded the <HI>Pi|azza,</HI>
he enters in by the principal gate into the Pa|lace;
where being arrived at the foot of the &s;tairs
he goes off the <HI>Pergolette</HI> to go up. In the mid&s;t of
the &s;tairs he finds the Coun&s;ellors and <HI>Capi de Qua|ranta</HI>
who there wait for him. When he is got up
to the top of the &s;tairs, the elde&s;t Coun&s;ellor puts
upon his head the Ducal Cap; and thence he is lead
into the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">To put him in mind of his mortality, becau&s;e that is the place where the Corps of the decea&s;ed Dukes lie in state.</NOTE> <HI>Sala de Pioveghi,</HI> and after he hath &s;itten
<PB N="187" REF="106">
a while there in a &s;eat appointed for that purpo&s;e, he
is conducted by them to his Lodgings; and the Pa|lace
being re&s;igned to him, they all go to their own
homes. His habit much differing from the common
renders him venerable. On his head he wears a Du|cal
Cap, called <HI>il Corno,</HI> becau&s;e it hath an <HI>Apex</HI>
or horn ari&s;ing above the top of it on the hinder part,
and under that a white coif, with little &s;trings, which
from the ears hang down backward upon his neck.
On his back a loo&s;e ve&s;t or mantle without &s;leeves &s;o
long that it draws upon the ground, of velvet, Da|ma&s;k,
Scarlet, or any other rich cloth. When he goes
abroad the Bells of St. <HI>Marks</HI> are rung: there are
certain Banners carried before him, and Trumpets of
an extraordinary greatne&s;s &s;ounded: then follows
the Cu&s;hion or Pillow, and the &s;eat of Gold, and after
that the Duke him&s;elf under an <HI>Vmbrella,</HI> between
two of the principal forein Emba&s;&s;adors or Agents
then in town, and the others behind him. After him
follow about 30 couple of the chief Gentlemen, all
in cloth of Scarlet; and he that hath the right hand
in the fir&s;t couple carries a Sword upright in his
hand.</P>

<HEAD>The COVNSELLORS.</HEAD>
<P>The Duke cannot determine, nor &s;o much as ex|cute
any the lea&s;t be&s;ine&s;s alone without the pre&s;ence
of the Coun&s;ellors, who are in number &s;ix, one for
each <HI>Se&s;tiero.</HI> They are always cho&s;en of the mo&s;t ho|nourable
Gentlemen of the City; the greatne&s;s and
dignity of their office requiring it. They are not all
&s;ix cho&s;en at the &s;ame time, but by three and three;
tho&s;e for the three <HI>Se&s;tieri</HI> on one &s;ide the Great cha|nel
at one time, and tho&s;e for the <HI>Se&s;tieri</HI> on the other
&s;ide at another. They are cho&s;en by the Great Coun|cil,
and are of the number of tho&s;e Magi&s;trates that
require four Competitors: but the Council of <HI>Pre|gadi</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="107">
for each of the&s;e makes one Competitor; who
is afterward balloted in the Great Council. So then
when there is an Election to be made of three Coun|&s;ellors,
the Great Council is a&s;&s;embled, and after
that the four &s;ets of Electors are made, and with|drawn
into their &s;everal rooms, to make their Ele|ctions
after the order before &s;et down, one of the
Secretaries gives notice to all who have votes in the
Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> that they withdraw into the
Chamber adjoyning to the Great Council-chamber,
where the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> u&s;es to meet. Where
when they are all met, the Duke with the Coun&s;el|lors
and <HI>Capi de Quaranta</HI> goes in to them; and it
being by lot determined for what <HI>Se&s;tiero</HI> a Coun&s;el|lor
&s;hall be fir&s;t cho&s;en, every one names him whom he
would have to be Coun&s;ellor. All the per&s;ons nomina|ted
are written down, and afterwards balloted; and
he that hath more then half the number of &s;uffrages is
coh&s;en Competitor: and this manner of chu&s;ing in
the Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> is called <HI>Scrutinio.</HI> The
Council of <HI>Pregadi</HI> and the <HI>Duke</HI> being returned into
the Great Council, and the Competitors made, they
are all balloted after the manner fore-mentioned, and
he that hath mo&s;t above half the number of &s;uffra|ges
is under&s;tood to be cho&s;en Coun&s;ellor. It may
happen that in the Great Council one only may come
to be nominated Competitor, and &s;ometimes the
&s;ame that is cho&s;en by the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> in which ca&s;e he
ought to be balloted; notwith&s;tanding that by the
Law none can be balloted without a Competitor:
becau&s;e being nominated in divers Councils, he is
under&s;tood to be Competitor with him&s;elf, as hath
been before intimated; and if he hath more then half
the &s;uffrages he is cho&s;en, [<HI>NB.</HI> Where there are
more Competitors then one balloted for any place
for which the <HI>Pregadi</HI> chu&s;e a Competitor, it hap|pens
for the mo&s;t part that he is cho&s;en who was made
Competitor by the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> becau&s;e of the Dignity
<PB N="189" REF="107">
and Reputation of that Council.] The &s;ix Coun&s;el|lors
&s;it with the <HI>Duke,</HI> and with him admini&s;ter all
affairs, and di&s;patch e&s;pecially all private bu&s;ine&s;s:
as for example, give Audience, read publick Letters,
grant Privileges, and the like; which things cannot
be done by the <HI>Duke,</HI> if there be not four Coun&s;ellors
pre&s;ent; and yet the Coun&s;ellors may di&s;patch any
the like bu&s;ine&s;s, though the Duke be not with them.
They have power of propounding in the Great
Council, the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and Council
of Ten; which he <HI>Savi</HI> who have power of pro|pounding
matters in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and
the <HI>Capi di Dieci</HI> who have privilege of propound|ing
in the Council of Ten, have not; &s;o that the
the Authority of the Coun&s;ellors is greater then that
of the <HI>Savi,</HI> or <HI>Capi di Dieci.</HI> [<HI>NB.</HI> That any one
Coun&s;ellor, though no other concur with him, may
propound in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but not in the
Council of Ten, unle&s;s three more concur with him
in the &s;ame opinion.] This Magi&s;tracy continues
for a whole year, but is exerci&s;ed but 8 months;
the other four months being &s;pent in the <HI>Quarantia
criminale,</HI> wherein three Coun&s;ellors continually
&s;it, who during that time are called <HI>Con&s;iglieri da
ba&s;&s;o, i. e.</HI> lower Coun&s;ellors. They may &s;it in this
Court either the fir&s;t 4 months, or the la&s;t 4, or the
two fir&s;t and two la&s;t, And therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary
that there be always nine Coun&s;ellors, &s;ix who &s;it
con&s;tantly with the Duke, and the three now men|tioned:
and when the&s;e are to go &s;it with the Duke,
or go out of their office, three of tho&s;e which &s;it
with the Duke come down to &s;it in the <HI>Quaranatia</HI> or
fini&s;h their office, and there are three new ones crea|ted.
Moreover it is to be under&s;tood, that with
the Duke and &s;ix Coun&s;ellors do al&s;o &s;it three of the
<HI>Quarantia criminale,</HI> i. e. the 40 Judges in criminal
cau&s;es, whom they call <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> who hold
this Dignity two months: &s;o that by the <HI>Signoria</HI>
<PB N="190" REF="108">
is under&s;tood the <HI>Duke,</HI> the &s;ix Coun&s;ellors, and the
three <HI>Capi di Quaranta.</HI> Anciently the Duke with
his Coun&s;ellors was wont to be pre&s;ent at the judg|ments
of the <HI>Quarantia;</HI> but <HI>Marcus Cornarus</HI> who
was made Duke in the year 1365. by rea&s;on of the
multitude of bu&s;ine&s;s which daily encrea&s;ed in the
Commonwealth, left that care to tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors
we have been &s;peaking of. The three <HI>Capi de Qua|ranta</HI>
&s;it with the Duke and Coun&s;ellors, that as the
<HI>Quarantia</HI> participates with the <HI>Signory,</HI> having three
Coun&s;ellors joined with them; &s;o the <HI>Signory</HI> may
partake of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI> the three <HI>Capi de Qua|ranta</HI>
&s;itting with them. And &s;o the <HI>Signory</HI> comes
to intermeddle with the bu&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Quarantia,</HI>
and the <HI>Quarantia</HI> with the affairs of the <HI>Signory.</HI>
And now to acquaint the Reader with all the Dukes
management. Fir&s;t, he with the Coun&s;ellors inter|venes
in, and is part of the College, the Council of
<HI>Pregadi,</HI> and the Great Council, as we have already
&s;ignified. He is al&s;o pre&s;ent in the Council of Ten,
and hath power of propounding in all the&s;e Coun|cils;
&s;o that no affairs can be cannot treated of without his
pre&s;ence, though alone he cannot di&s;patch any bu&s;i|ne&s;s.
Public Letters are written in his name, as
al&s;o all Privileges and publick Writings, as though
he were the Author of them. All Letters that come
from Forein Princes and Emba&s;&s;adors, and Agents
&s;ent abroad by the Commonwealth, are directed to
him. When the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land or Sea, or other
Magi&s;trates write Letters to their Proveditors, they
&s;ub&s;cribe them with the Dukes name thus, <HI>Domini|cus
Contarenus Dux Venetiarum.</HI> And this mode is
ob&s;erved in all other &s;orts or public Writings, as
Patents, Privileges, Obligations, Laws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The
Council of Ten varies this form and &s;ub&s;cribes in
two manners, for either the whole Council writes
and then they &s;ub&s;cribe <HI>Dominicus Contarenus Dux
Venetiarum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum no&s;tro Concilio Decem;</HI> and tho&s;e
<PB N="191" REF="108">
that an&s;wer &s;uper&s;cribe accordingly. Or only the
Heads or Chiefs of the Council of Ten, called <HI>Capi
di Dieci,</HI> write; and then the Sub&s;cription is, <HI>Domi|nicus
Contarenus Dux Venetiarum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum Copitibus
Concilii Decem.</HI> And tho&s;e that return an&s;wer &s;uper|&s;cribe
accordingly. Every eighth day, that is on
Wedne&s;day weekly, the Duke is wont to go down
and vi&s;it the Courts of Ju&s;tice, making a tour round
the two <HI>Corridores,</HI> where the Magi&s;trates &s;it, &s;top|ping
a while at each Court, and &s;tirring up and en|couraging
the Judge or Magi&s;trate that pre&s;ides there
to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice impartially. And if there be
any one that thinks he hath not right done him, he
recommends him&s;elf to the <HI>Duke,</HI> acquainting him
with his cau&s;e; and if the Duke judges that he is in|jured
by fal&s;e judgment, he pre&s;ently commands
that Magi&s;trate or Judge to do him right; but if the
contrary appears to him, he reproves him that
thought him&s;elf agrieved, and goes on in his Vi&s;ita|tion.
Some Dukes have changed this order, not vi|&s;iting
always on the &s;ame day, that they might come
upon the Mgi&s;trates unexpected. Multitude of bu|&s;ine&s;s
&s;ometimes con&s;trains the Duke to intermit this
u&s;age for a week or two. All the money of the Com|monwealth
is al&s;o &s;tamped with the Dukes name,
but not with his face or image. That he may be the
better enabled (&s;aith my Authour) to maintain his
port, and live with that magnificence &s;uch a place
requires, he hath an allowance from the Public of
3500 Ducats <HI>per annum;</HI> a &s;orry Revenue for one
that hath the &s;hew and Title of a Prince, being le&s;s
than &s;o many <HI>French</HI> Crowns. And yet he is obli|ged
to keep a Family that may be honourable and
&s;uitable to &s;uch a Dignity; and moreover to make 4
Fea&s;ts yearly at 4 &s;everal times, <HI>viz.</HI> upon St. <HI>Ste|phen</HI>'s
day, St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s day, <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> day, and St.
<HI>Vit</HI>'s day: to which Fea&s;ts it is the cu&s;tom to~ invite
all the Gentlemen according to their ages. To the
<PB N="192" REF="109">
fir&s;t, be&s;ides the Coun&s;ellors, the <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI>
the Auvogadors, and the <HI>Capi de Dieci,</HI> are invited
tho&s;e that are of greate&s;t age and gravity: to the

<HEAD>The Council of TEN.</HEAD>
<P>The Council of Ten, though it be a member of
great importance, yet is it rather acce&s;&s;ary or adjun|ctive
then principal, and &s;eems to me much to re|&s;emble
the <HI>Dictator,</HI> that was wont to be created by
the <HI>Romans</HI> in times of great and imminent danger;
only differs in that the Commonwealth is never
without this Magi&s;tracy. The Authority thereof is
equal to that of the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> and the
whole City; and therefore it may meddle with and
tran&s;act any State-affairs as it plea&s;es, without appeal,
or being accountable to any Superior Power. Though
this power be not u&s;ed by it, except only in ca&s;es of
greate&s;t importance, and which cannot otherwi&s;e be
remedied or provided for: as for example, to con|&s;ider
about making War, concluding a Peace, or
other negotiation &s;ecretly, to &s;end a Proveditor into
the Camp &s;peedily: which things if they &s;hould be
fir&s;t treated of in the College, and afterwards deba|ted
in the Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> they could not be ma|naged
and tran&s;acted with that &s;ecre&s;ie, expedition,
and other cirum&s;tances as the time and conjuncture
<PB N="193" REF="109">
of affairs requires. When the College then intends
to manage any bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ecretly; as &s;uppo&s;e to con|clude
an agreement with any Prince or State, to at|tempt
any thing on their enemies, or begin any new
enterpri&s;e or de&s;ign, which ought to be kept &s;ecret
till the time of execution, then they cua&s;e Letters to
be written to &s;uch Agents or other per&s;ons as are
to be employed in that bu&s;ine&s;s, with this In&s;cripti|on,
<HI>Dominicus Contarenus Dux Venetiarum,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>cum
Concilio no&s;tro Decem:</HI> and they &s;uper&s;cribe their an|&s;wers
in like manner: and their Letters are received
by the <HI>Capi de Dieci,</HI> who bring them to the Col|lege;
at which time the three <HI>Capi de Quaranta,</HI> and
the <HI>Savi di mare</HI> are excluded: and then they treat
of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and debate it as long as is needful;
yet not they alone, for the <HI>Capi de Dieci</HI> call the re&s;t
of the Council of Ten. Be&s;ides at &s;uch con&s;ultati|ons
are pre&s;ent not only the Duke, the Coun&s;ellors,
and all the Council of Ten, but the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI>
and the <HI>Savi</HI> of the Land, the <HI>Giunta</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts
of fifteen, the Auvogadors and nine of the Procura|tors.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>N.

but only tho&s;e ten of the Council of X, the
<HI>Giunta,</HI> the Duke, and the &s;ix Coun&s;ellors. The
Aggregate of all the&s;e united with the Council of X
is called the Council of X with the <HI>Giunta;</HI>
which is not convened but on weighty occa&s;ions,
to debate and manage great affairs and &s;uch
as appertain to the &s;tate of the whole City; which
affairs might be treated of and di&s;patched by the
Council of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but for the re&s;pects afore|&s;aid
are undertaken by this Council. The Council
of X was erected &s;ome &s;ay after the death of <HI>Vitale
Michaeli,</HI> to puni&s;h &s;uch as had plotted trea&s;on again&s;t
the Commonwealth. Others &s;ay it had its beginning
<PB N="194" REF="110">
in the time of <HI>Pietro Gradenigo.</HI> At fir&s;t its Authority
was but &s;mall, but by little and little its reputation
encrea&s;ed. It puni&s;hes be&s;ides &s;uch as practice Trea|&s;on
or con&s;pire again&s;t the Commonwealth, tho&s;e
that coin counterfeit monys, tho&s;e that commit &s;ins
again&s;t Nature, as Sodomy and be&s;tiality. It al&s;o
di&s;po&s;es of certain moneys which are a&s;&s;igned to it by
the Chamberlains and other Officers: it hath the
command of certain Galleys in the Ar&s;enal, marked
with the&s;e two letters, C and X, &s;ignifying that &s;uch
Ve&s;&s;els are in the power of the <HI>Capi de Dieci.</HI> It al&s;o
takes care of the Artillery. When any of the&s;e things
are to be con&s;idered of, then only tho&s;e Ten that are
of the Council of X with the Duke and Coun&s;ellors
are a&s;&s;embled; and this is called ab&s;olutely and &s;im|ply
the Council of X. The ten of this Council are
cho&s;en in the Great Council like the other Magi|&s;trates
for one year; out of which are taken by lot
every month three, who are called the Heads or
Chiefs of the ten [<HI>Capi de Dieci</HI>] and of the&s;e one
pre&s;ides every week, which is he who in the Great
Council-chamber takes place over again&s;t the Duke.
The office of the&s;e is to convoke the Council of X,
and propound their opinions therein; yet not &s;ingly
but all three together, or at lea&s;t two; and they are
obliged to call the Council every 8 days, and oftner
if occa&s;ion require. Anciently there was no deter|minate
time for a&s;&s;embling this Council, but becau&s;e
every time it was convened the whole City was mo|ved
and troubled, as judging that it was not without
&s;ome great rea&s;on; therefore to avoid and prevent
&s;uch di&s;turbance and di&s;quiet of mens minds there
was a time determined for its meeting. When they
are to pa&s;s &s;entence upon any offender that is in their
hands for the forementioned crimes, he cannot ei|ther
by him&s;elf or any other per&s;on plead his cau&s;e
or defend him&s;elf but appears before the Council
and is examined, and there are notes taken of all he
<PB N="195" REF="110">
&s;aith. And when the <HI>Capi di Dieci</HI> bring in &s;uch a
cau&s;e into the Council, either one of them mu&s;t un|dertake
his defence and plead for him, or el&s;e he
cannot be defended at all. From the Sentence of
this Council there is no appeal, neither can it be re|ver&s;ed
or changed but by them&s;elves or &s;ucce&s;&s;ors,
if the matter be &s;uch as is capable of change. Tho&s;e
of this Council &s;o &s;oon as they go out of their of|fice
may pre&s;ently enter upon another. For all the&s;e
places, the Grand <HI>Savi,</HI> the Savi of the Land and
Savi of the Sea, the Coun&s;ellors, the ten of this
Council, the Auvogadors and Cen&s;ors give no im|pediment
one to another; but &s;o &s;oon as a Gentle|man
hath fini&s;hed one of the&s;e Offices, he may enter
upon another. If it happens that any one while he
is exerci&s;ing a le&s;&s;er Magi&s;tracy be cho&s;en to a greater,
he may if he plea&s;es relinqui&s;h the le&s;s, and take the

<HEAD>The Procurators of St. MARK.</HEAD>
<P>The Office of Procurator is of great reputation
in this City. Though it be not of the number of
tho&s;e which have to do with the admini&s;tration and
government of the Commonwealth: yet is it ho|nourable,
becau&s;e, as that of the Duke, it continues
for life; and is be&s;ides ancient, and hath maintained
its Reputation to the pre&s;ent times. There was ne|ver
any Gentleman of great e&s;teem in the City, but
he was adorned with this Dignity: &s;o that very few
have been Dukes &s;ince this Magi&s;tracy was ordained
but they have before been <HI>Procurators.</HI> Anciently
there was but one Procurator made, to take care of
the Church of St. <HI>Mark</HI> and its trea&s;ure; but after
the death of <HI>Seba&s;tian Ciani,</HI> he having left a great
Legacy to St. <HI>Marks,</HI> the Revenues whereof were to
be di&s;tributed by the Procurator; one per&s;on not
&s;ufficing for &s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s, it was found nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="196" REF="111">
to create another; who&s;e charge it &s;hould be to &s;u|perintend
and manage the Legacy of <HI>Seba&s;tian Ciani.</HI>
Afterwards Legacies being multiplied, in the year
1270. in the time of <HI>Rinieri Zeno,</HI> a third was thought
fit to be created; and they did &s;o divide the bu&s;ine&s;s
among them, that one took care of the Church, an|other
of the Legacies bequeathed by them that dwelt
on this &s;ide the great Chanel; and the third of their
Legacies who dwelt on the other &s;ide of the great
Chanel. In the &s;ame Dukes time there was a fourth
created to be Collegue with him that governed the
Church and its Trea&s;ures. For the &s;ame rea&s;on two
more were added when <HI>John Soranzo</HI> was Duke.
Afterwards in the year 1423. when <HI>Francis Fo&s;caro</HI>
was made Duke there were three more created anew;
&s;o that then the whole number was nine; three of
whom took care of the Church and its Trea&s;ures;
three of the Legacies of the three <HI>Se&s;tieri</HI> on one &s;ide
the great Chanel; and three of the Legacies of the
three <HI>Se&s;tieri</HI> on the other &s;ide. In the year 1509.
when the Republics Armies were broken and routed
at <HI>Addua</HI> by <HI>Lewis XII,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> they were
con&s;trained to create &s;ix for mony, conferring that
honour upon &s;uch as would lend the Commonwealth
&s;uch a certain &s;um. The&s;e Procurators have power to
compel Heirs to perform the Wills of the Te&s;tators.
They wear Ducal habits, and carry &s;ervants about
with them; and have the precedence of all other
Magi&s;trates. In proce&s;&s;ons the Coun&s;ellors and
three <HI>Capi de Quaranta</HI> take place of them. They
have either an habitation a&s;&s;igned them, or 60 Ducats
<HI>per annum</HI> allowed. They all enter into the Coun|cil
of <HI>Pregadi,</HI> but not all into the Council of Ten,
but only nine cho&s;en by the &s;aid Council, three for a
Procuracy. They are not capable of any other Ma|gi&s;tracy,
except that of <HI>Savio grande</HI> and the <HI>Gi|unta</HI>
of the Council of X. When there is a Captain
of the <HI>Armata,</HI> or a Proveditor of the Camp to be
<PB N="197" REF="111">
cho&s;en, there is a Law made in the <HI>Pregadi,</HI> that any
one that is Procurator may obtain that Dignity.
They cannot go to the Great Council, but only in
the Election of the Duke; which licen&s;e is then
granted them by an e&s;pecial Law. They were wont
anciently upon all tho&s;e days the Great Council met,
during all the time the Council &s;ate, to continue in
the Court of the Palace, and never to depart thence
till the Great Council was ri&s;en; that if any unex|pected
or &s;uddain accident &s;hould happen they might
be ready to remedy or a&s;&s;i&s;t. And this perchance was
the rea&s;on that it was forbidden them to go to the
Great Council. But in our time this u&s;ance is not ob|&s;erved,
becau&s;e of that quiet and tranquility the
Commonwealth enjoys: Which is &s;uch, that no
man thinks there can any accident happen in the City
which &s;hall require the pre&s;ence of the Procurators
more is one place than in another. There is no Ma|gi&s;tracy
or Dignity in the City of much de&s;ired by the
Gentlemen as this of Procurator: Yet I think that
it hath lo&s;t much of its ancient reputation. For
whereas formerly it was not wont to be granted to
any but ancient men, and great repute; in our
times we have &s;een many adorned therewith, who
were neither of mature age, nor great e&s;teem and
credit.</P>
<P>Of the other Officers and Magi&s;trates (whereof
this Republic hath good &s;tore) I &s;hall &s;ay nothing, they
belonging rather to the admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice
and particular civil affairs, then the Government of
the Commonwealth. Only it is worth the notice ta|king,
that they have &s;o many Offices divided among
the Gentlemen, to bu&s;ie and employ the greater num|ber
of them, that &s;o having &s;omething to entertain
their time with, they may not be at lei&s;ure to think
upon innovating in the Government, or any way de|&s;ign
and practice again&s;t the con&s;titution of the
Commonwealth, to the di&s;turbance of the peace.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="112">
The Gentlemen while they are in the City wear
black Gowns with narrow &s;leeves, and caps; with|out
which habit they never appear in the &s;treets, or
any public place. In the <HI>Piazza</HI> of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> that &s;ide
next the Great Council-chamber is appropriated to
them to walk in, where no others mingle with them.
This walk, or rather the company of Gentlemen
walking together there; they call the Broil [<HI>Broglio.</HI>]
The principal diver&s;ion of the Gentlemen, Citizens,
and Strangers is to walk in this <HI>Piazza.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Citizens of what quality or e&s;tate &s;o|ever
have no &s;hare or intere&s;t at all in the Govrern|ment
of the Commonwealth. Probable it is, that
when the Creat Council was &s;hut up (as they phra&s;e
it) that is, determined to &s;uch a number of Families
excluding all the re&s;t, that all the Citizens of any
quality were therein comprehended; becau&s;e before
that time the Government having been common to
all, it is not likely the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment would
have taken place without commotion and di&s;tur|bance,
if there had been a con&s;iderable number of
Citizens of fa&s;hion and intere&s;t left out. Formerly
this honour hath been given to many Citizens of
eminent merit. Lately &s;ince the Wars with the
Turks in <HI>Candy</HI> for 100000 Ducats any Citizen
might be created Nobleman&punc; By which means the
State rai&s;ed millions of Ducats there ha|ving
been more then four&s;core Families advanced to
that Dignity.</P>
<P>They put not weapons into the Citizens hands,
but chu&s;e rather to make u&s;e of mercenary Souldiers
in their Wars.</P>
<P>There is no Law that prohibits any Citizen to be
cho&s;en to any place or Office by the Great Council,
nor doth there need it: For that they are as &s;ure not
to be co&s;en as though there were &s;uch a Law, the
intere&s;t of the Nobility being as &s;trong a bar to &s;uch
a choice as Law would be. And yet <HI>Gianotti</HI> &s;aith,
<PB N="199" REF="112">
that &s;ome have attained to be nominated and balloted
in the Great Council.</P>
<P>The air, notwith&s;tanding the &s;ituation of the Ci|ty,
is held to be very good and healthful, and (which
is more) agreeable to people of all countreys and
tempers. We never enjoyed our health better, nor
had better &s;tomachs to our meat in any place beyond
the Seas then we had heer.</P>
<P>Heer we fir&s;t &s;aw the <HI>Ludicrum,</HI> called by &s;ome
<HI>Diabolus in carc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re,</HI> from a little hollow gla&s;s-image
made like the Picture of the Devil (though a gla&s;s-bubble
would &s;erve the purpo&s;e as well or better)
which being put into a cylindrical gla&s;s-tube full of
water they could make a&s;cend, de&s;cend or re&s;t in any
part of the tube at plea&s;ure. The manner thus, They
prepare an <HI>icuncula</HI> or gla&s;s-bubble hollow and ha|ving
in the heavier end of it a little hole of &s;uch a
poi&s;e as ju&s;t to a&s;cend and &s;wim in water, and having
put it into a gla&s;s-tube &s;topt clo&s;e or &s;ealed at one
end, and almo&s;t full of water, they clap their hand
on the mouth of the tube, and pre&s;s down the air
upon the <HI>&s;uperficies</HI> of the water. The water being
thus pre&s;t, pre&s;&s;es upon the air in the <HI>icuncula</HI> or
bubble; which giving place, part of the water thru&s;ts
into it by the little hole. The bubble thereupon be|coming
heavier &s;inks in the water. Then taking up
the hand and removing the force, the air in the
<HI>icuncula</HI> or bubble by its ela&s;tic power expands it
&s;elf, and expelling the water again, the <HI>icuncula</HI> or
bubble a&s;cends; and &s;o by proportioning the force
they can make it not only a&s;cend and de&s;cend from
top to bottom, but re&s;t at what point of height or
depth they plea&s;e. Of this and other ludicrous ex|periments
concerning the motion of the&s;e bubbles,
I &s;hall not think much heer to &s;et down what Doctor
<HI>Cornelius</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI> hath delivered in his <HI>Progymna&s;|mata
Phy&s;ica,</HI> Epi&s;t. de <HI>Circumpul&s;ione Platonica</HI> I
was (&s;aith he) informed by <HI>Lud. Ca&s;alius</HI> of an expe|riment
<PB N="200" REF="113">
invented at <HI>Florence, viz.</HI> Two gla&s;s-bubbles
being put into a ve&s;&s;el of water were &s;o alternately
moved, that in cold water the one &s;ank to the bot|tom,
the other &s;wam on the top; but putting in a
little hot water they changed places, that at the bot|tom
a&s;cending up to the top, and that on the top
&s;inking down to the bottom. Being taken with the
novity of the thing, I applyed my mind to con&s;ider
what might be the Phy&s;ical re&s;on of it, and &s;oon
found out how it might be effected, to wit, one of
the&s;e Gla&s;s-bubbles was perforated with a little hole
on the heavier &s;ide, and blown &s;o light as to &s;wim in
water: then &s;ome of the air being &s;uckt out, there
was &s;o much water let in in the room thereof, as to
make the bubble &s;ink in cold water, which upon fil|ling
the Ve&s;&s;el with hot water would mount up to the
top. For the air in the bubble being rarefied or dila|ted
by the heat of the water pre&s;ently expells the
water contained in the bubble, and &s;o the bubble be|coming
lighter a&s;cends, The other gla&s;s-bubble is
imperforate and made of that poi&s;e as to &s;wim in
cold water and &s;ink in hot. He goes on.</P>

&s;aw him perform. When he charged him&s;elf he
lay upon his hands and knees, and put his head on
the ground almo&s;t between his legs.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Nobleman &s;hewed us the experiment,
and gave us the receipt of a fulminating powder,
which will do almo&s;t as well as that chargeable one
made of gold. Take of &s;alt of Tartar one part, of com|mon
Brim&s;tone two parts, of Nitre or Salt-peter three
parts; put the&s;e three all at once into a Mortar, beat
them fine and mingle them well together. Take of
this powder and put it on a plate of iron, or in a fire|pan
or other ve&s;&s;el, and hold it over a flame of fire
or a pan of charcoal: When the powder begins to
melt, it will explode with a very &s;mart crack like to
<HI>Aurum fulminans.</HI> The &s;ame or the like fulmina|ting
powder hath been &s;ince &s;hewn us by Mr. <HI>Fi&s;her</HI>
of <HI>Sheffield.</HI> It is not unlikely that there may be &s;e|veral
&s;orts of powder made, which &s;hall explode
and fulminate after this fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman al&s;o &s;hew'd us the whole
proce&s;s of making <HI>Venice-Sope,</HI> which is very like
and nothing inferiour to <HI>Ca&s;tile-Sope.</HI> It is made
of the be&s;t Oil Olive, and a <HI>lixivium</HI> or Lye. The
<HI>lixivium</HI> is thus made. They take of the a&s;hes of
<HI>Kali,</HI> made in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> known by the
name of <HI>Beriglia,</HI> two thirds, of <HI>Kelp, i. e.</HI> the a&s;hes
of the ordinary Sea-wrack one third. The&s;e they
<PB N="203" REF="114">
break into &s;mall pieces with a mallet or hammer,
and mingle well together. This done they put them
into a mill, &s;uch as we grind apples in to make Cider,
and grind them to powder, and then &s;ift them. This
powder they mingle with a little &s;laked lime, and
make it up into pellets, which they put into letches
or troughs, and pouring water upon them make
the <HI>Lixivium.</HI> The Cauldrons wherein they boil their
Sope are very large. The bottom of them is a copper
ve&s;&s;el, but the &s;ides are made up of &s;tone clo&s;e ce|mented
together, bound about with iron hoops, and
enclo&s;ed in a ca&s;e of Wood. Into the&s;e Cauldrons
they put a great quantity of Oil, it may be one
third part of the mea&s;ure, or more or le&s;s as they
plea&s;e: then they fill them up with the <HI>lixivium,</HI> and
putting fire under it, cau&s;e it to boil continually; as
the <HI>lixivium</HI> boils away &s;till filling it up with new, till
all the oil be con&s;umed or boiled out of it. For the
oil uniting it &s;elf with the &s;alt of the <HI>lixivium</HI> ri&s;es
continually up to the top in the form of a &s;cum or
froth, which by degrees grows thicker and thicker,
and by rea&s;on of the cold of the air conden&s;es into
that body we call Sope. This &s;cum continues to ri&s;e
&s;o long as there is any oil remaining in the ve&s;&s;els;
the cremor or coat of Sope growing &s;till thicker.
Tho&s;e that are practi&s;ed can tell by the &s;mell when
all the oil is boiled away. The <HI>lixivium</HI> they account
&s;trong enough &s;o long as it will bear an egg. This
<HI>lixivium</HI> they make of Sea water, but they told us
they might as well make it of fre&s;h water. To ex|pedite
the making the <HI>lixivium,</HI> they take &s;ome of
the boiling <HI>lixivium</HI> out of the Cauldrons; to which
purpo&s;e there is a pipe comes out of the Cauldron in
the region of the <HI>lixivium,</HI> whereby they let out the
boiling <HI>lixivium</HI> into a trough; and this together
with cold water they pour upon the a&s;hes to promote
the &s;eparation of the &s;alt. When the oil is boil'd
away they let all cool, and taking the <HI>cremor</HI> or cru&s;t
<PB N="204" REF="115">
of Sope off the &s;uperficies of the liquor, &s;pread it
upon a floor, and &s;mooth it, and &s;o let it dry in a
bed of more then a bricks thickne&s;s. When it is
dried they cut it long ways and cro&s;s ways into ob|long
parallelograms, or the figure of oblong bricks,
there being nicks in the borders of the beds on pur|po&s;e
to direct the in&s;truments to cut it. This done
they pare the&s;e pieces from any impurities that may
adhere to them from the bottom of the bed, (For the
beds are all &s;trowed with Lime-du&s;t to hinder the
&s;ticking of the Sope to the floor) and run them over
a plane, to &s;mooth them. The&s;e large pieces they
&s;ubdivide into le&s;&s;er, and &s;eal them with a Seal.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why they mix <HI>Kelp</HI> with the <HI>Beriglia,</HI>
is becau&s;e <HI>Beriglia</HI> alone would make the Sope too
&s;oft, and <HI>Kelp</HI> alone too brittle.</P>
<P>To colour the Sope green they take the juyce of
Beet, a good quantity, and put it into the Cauldron
with the <HI>lixivium</HI> and oyl. The <HI>Germans</HI> will have
it thus coloured, and perhaps the Nitre which is in
this juyce may add &s;ome vigour to the Sope.</P>
<P>The fire is continually kept burning, and &s;o the
liquor boiling till the operation be fini&s;hed.</P>

with two walls: the interior (called <HI>Antenors</HI> wall,
though of a far later make) is about three miles in

<P>Of the &s;everal changes of Government which

fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Milan,</HI> they did of their own accord

which rea&s;on they enjoy great privileges and immu|nities.
The Theater of the Academy called the <HI>Olym|pici</HI>

The Inhabitants of this City drive a great
trade in breeding and feeding of Silk-worms, and
in winding, twi&s;ting, and dying of &s;ilk. The Wines
of this Territory are very rich and gu&s;tful, e&s;pecially
that &s;ort called <HI>Dolce &amp; piccante.</HI></P>

more then 650 perches, which make about 4000
feet in length, 490 perches or 3000 foot in breadth,
and about three miles in circuit. We took it to be
nothing el&s;e but a Cave left from the digging of
&s;tone; as the &s;ame <HI>Tri&s;&s;inus</HI> by &s;ufficient arguments
proves it to be. 1. Becau&s;e the ancient buildings of
<HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Vicenza</HI> are of the &s;ame kind of &s;tone.
2. Becau&s;e to &s;upport the roof they have every where
at di&s;tances &s;ometimes greater, &s;ometimes le&s;s, left
huge pila&s;ters of the quarry, of 3 perches &s;quare a|piece;
of which pila&s;ters in the whole cave there are
thought to be about 1000. 3. There are &s;ome great
&s;quare pieces of &s;tone cut round about, in order to
taking them up and carrying them away. 4. There
remain manife&s;t prints and tracks of cart-wheels;
whereas no man living can remember that ever cart
went in there.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved many Bats clinging to the roof and
walls of this Cave; and in &s;ome &s;tanding waters a

Maro.</HI> In this City are two Societies of <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> (Aca|demies
they call them) the one &s;tile them&s;elves <HI>Ac|ce&s;i,</HI>
the other <HI>Timidi.</HI></P>
<P>This City hath according to the fate of her neigh|bours
undergone &s;everal changes of Government.
In the year 1328. <HI>Lewis Gonzaga</HI> by the favour of the
people made him&s;elf Lord of it, from whom the
<PB N="222" REF="124">
pre&s;ent Duke is de&s;cended. In the year 1433. <HI>John-Francis
Gonzaga</HI> was created Marque&s;s of <HI>Manina,</HI>
by the Emperor <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> IV. In the year 1530.
<HI>Frederic Gonzaga</HI> was created Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> by the
Emperor <HI>Charles V.</HI></P>
<P>The Dukes yearly revenue is &s;aid to be 400000
crowns, according to the account we had of it in
particulars &s;omewhat le&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> the mills pay 4000
crowns <HI>per annum.</HI> The Jews (who are about 6000
in number, and wear no badge of di&s;tinction) give
20000 crowns <HI>per annum.</HI> The re&s;t of the Citizens
of <HI>Mantua</HI> 70000 crowns. The Countrey yields
60000 pi&s;tols; and <HI>Mont&s;errat</HI> 13000, in all 386000
crowns the year. Yet is the pre&s;ent Prince, through
ill husbandry not proportioning his expences to his
income, become very poor, being indebted to the
<HI>Venetians</HI> (as <HI>Leti</HI> &s;aith) four millions of crowris.
To advance his Revenue at the time of our being
there he was put to that pitiful &s;hift of deba&s;ing his
coin, &s;o that none of his money would pa&s;s further
then his own Territory. His name was <HI>Carolus Gon|zaga</HI>
II. &s;ince dead, and his Son <HI>Caroulus Ferdinandus</HI>
&s;ucceeds him in his e&s;tates. There are be&s;ides of this
Family 4 or 5 &s;mall Princes, feudatory of the Em|pire,
but Sovereign Lords having <HI>Jura Regalia</HI> in
their petty States, <HI>viz.</HI> The Princes of 1. <HI>Novellara.
2. Bozolo.</HI> 3. <HI>Gu&s;talla.</HI> 4. <HI>Sabionetta,</HI> in which
the male line is failed. 5. <HI>Ca&s;tiglione.</HI> We were told
that the&s;e Princelets were obliged to attend the Duke
of <HI>Mantua</HI>'s Court three months in the year. The
Dukes Council of State or Privy Council con&s;i&s;ts on|ly
of &s;ix of the chief Nobility.</P>
<P>In the&s;e parts all the children of the common peo|ple
have equal &s;hares of their Parents E&s;tates, at lea&s;t
their moveables. The wife when her husband dies
carries her dowry back with her: if &s;he dies fir&s;t,
then her children (if &s;he leaves any) divide her dower
equally among them. If &s;he die childle&s;s her dower
<PB N="223" REF="124">
is divided, half goes to her husband, and half to her
next kindred. If a woman hath had children by one
husband and he dying &s;he marries again and hath
children by her &s;econd husband, her e&s;tate is divided
into equal parts, one moiety goes to her fir&s;t hu&s;|bands
children, and the other to her &s;econd's.</P>
<P>We took boat for <HI>Ferrara,</HI> which brought us fir&s;t
into the lake, then into the chanel of the River Min|cius,
[which runs out of the <HI>Lago di Garda</HI> (called
in <HI>Latine Lacus Benacus</HI>) at a &s;trong Fort of the <HI>Ve|netians</HI>
called <HI>Pe&s;chiera,</HI> and coming to <HI>Mantua</HI>
&s;preads it &s;elf into a lake of 5 miles long.] At 16
miles end we came to a Bridg and Sluce at a place cal|led
<HI>Governo,</HI> where we entred the River <HI>Po;</HI> going
down &s;tream we pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>O&s;tia</HI> 10 miles di&s;tant
from <HI>Governo;</HI> and 10 miles further down <HI>Ma&s;&s;a,</HI> both
on our left hand; and 7 miles below <HI>Ma&s;&s;a</HI> came to
<HI>Stellata,</HI> a large Village on our right hand, under
the Pope. Heer the Territory of <HI>Mantua</HI> ended.
Eight miles beyond this place we left the River <HI>Po</HI> at
a Village called <HI>Il Ponte,</HI> and &s;truck up an artificial
Chanel of 4 miles long, which brought &s;treight to
the Gates of <HI>Ferrara.</HI></P>
<P>This City is very con&s;iderable as well for its
greatne&s;s as its &s;trength. It is &s;aid to be about 7
miles in compa&s;s, and be&s;ides the advantage of its &s;i|ruation
in a fenny level it is &s;trongly fortified with
walls an bulwarks, and &s;urrounded with a broad
and deep trench full of water; &s;o that I look upon
it for a City of that bigne&s;s as the &s;tronge&s;t in all
<HI>Italy.</HI> It had formerly a Prince of its own, but is
now, with all its territory, &s;ubject to the <HI>Pope.</HI> From
<HI>Ferrara</HI> we went with the <HI>Procaccio</HI> or Courrier to
<HI>Bologna,</HI> &s;hifting our boat at a place called <HI>Mal-Al|bergo,</HI>
&s;ome 17 miles from <HI>Ferrara,</HI> where we went
up into a higher chanel, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Rhenus Bononien&s;is,</HI>
and pa&s;&s;ing through 9 locks or <HI>&s;o&s;tegni,</HI> we arrived
at <HI>Bologna,</HI> di&s;tant by water from <HI>Ferrara</HI> 45 miles.
<PB N="224" REF="125">
A great part of the Countrey we pa&s;&s;ed through be|tween
<HI>Ferrara</HI> and <HI>Bologna.</HI> is a perfect level, and fen|ny
ground, much like to the I&s;le of <HI>Ely</HI> in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bononia</HI> is a large City,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bologna</NOTE> of a round figure, and yet
7 or 8 miles in circuit. The hou&s;es not tall, fair por|tico's
on each &s;ide the &s;treets, convenient to walk in,
as well in Summer to defend one from the &s;corching
beams of the Sun, as in Winter to &s;helter form the
rain. Many Gentlemens hou&s;es (palaces they call
them) which make no great &s;hew outwardly in the
&s;treet, but within are very hand&s;ome and very con|venient,
having more in the <HI>rece&s;s</HI> then they pro|mi&s;e
in the <HI>front.</HI> The number of Inhabitants is
about 80000 &s;ouls. The <HI>Bologna</HI> &s;au&s;ages, wa&s;h|balls,
and little dogs are much e&s;teemed and talked
of in all <HI>Italy</HI> and el&s;ewhere. Heer is al&s;o a great
&s;ilk trade driven, and the be&s;t Engines for winding
and twi&s;ting of it that we have any where &s;een. The
Univer&s;ity of <HI>Bologna</HI> is one of the mo&s;t ancient and
famous in <HI>Europe,</HI> e&s;pecially for the &s;tudy of the Law.
There is &s;uch a multitude of profe&s;&s;ors in all faculties,
that I am afraid few Readers will have the patience
to run over the li&s;t of them, which for the &s;atisfa|ction
of the curious I here exhibit.</P>

<P>At <HI>Bononia</HI> we &s;aw the formerly famous exerci&s;e
of Ju&s;ting or Tilting, which is there &s;til u&s;ed in
Carneval time. The combatants being mounted on
hor&s;eback, armed cap-a-pee, and adorned with
huge Plumes of Feathers and Scarfs, with Launces
in their hands, run one at another a full gallop, one on
one &s;ide and another on the other &s;ide of a low rail.
They aim at one particular part (I think it is the eye)
and he that comes neare&s;t is the be&s;t Ju&s;ter. We
&s;aw &s;everal Launces broken but no per&s;on di&s;moun|ted,
nor any hurt done.</P>
<P>Heer by the favour of Dr. <HI>Ovidio Montalbano</HI> one

of <HI>aldrovandus,</HI> which by his la&s;t Will he left as a
Legacy to the City. It is kept in the Cardinal Le|gates
Palace commonly called <HI>Palazzo del Confalo|niero.</HI>
Among many natural and artificial Rarities

The crude &s;tone is like a kind of &s;parre or <HI>fluor;</HI> it

an iron grate over a fire of wood. But we believe

there is &s;omewhat more of my&s;tery in it; for &s;ome of
us calcining part of the &s;tone we purcha&s;ed of him ac|cording

The prepared &s;tone in time lo&s;es its vertue and cea&s;es

<P>We left <HI>Bologna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 22.</NOTE> and travelled to <HI>Modena,</HI> by

of <HI>Modena.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Modena.</NOTE> <HI>Modena</HI> is 20 miles di&s;tant from <HI>Bono|nia,</HI>
no great City, but for the bigne&s;s populous, be|ing

Heer as at <HI>Bononia, Padua,</HI> and &s;everal other Cities

and but of mean height, as we ob&s;erved them to be
in all tho&s;e Cities where the &s;treets cloy&s;tered

<P>Heer we &s;aw the Dukes Palace, which though it
be not va&s;t, nor makes any great &s;hew outwardly;
yet are the rooms within very elegant and richly
adorned with gilding, hangings, and Pictures of
the be&s;t Ma&s;ters. What we mo&s;t minded was the
Cabinet or <HI>mu&s;eum,</HI> furni&s;hed with choice of natural
Rarities, Jewels, ancient ad modern Coins and Me|dals,
ancient and modern Entaglia's, curious turn'd
Works, dried Plants pa&s;ted upon &s;mooth boards
whitened with ceru&s;s, which may be put in frames
and hung about a room like pictures; and a great
<PB N="237" REF="131" MS="y">
collection of de&s;igns of the be&s;t Painters. Among
other things we took notice of a humane head pe|trified;
a hens egg having on one &s;ide the &s;ignature

years before Sir <HI>Thomas Brown</HI> of <HI>Norwich</HI> &s;ent me the
picture of one having the perfect &s;ignature of a Duck
&s;wimming upon it, which he a&s;&s;ured me was natural.
Mo&s;s included in a piece of Cry&s;tal, &s;ilver in another.
A fly plainly di&s;cernable in a piece of Amber. A Chi|ne&s;e
Calendar written on wooden leaves. <HI>Almericus</HI>
Father to the pre&s;ent Duke (who at our being there
was a child of about 3 years old) made this Collecti|on,
and was treating with <HI>Manfredus Septalius</HI> Ca|non
at <HI>Millain</HI> for his Cabinet, &s;o much talked of all
over <HI>Italy;</HI> for which they told us he was to give
1000 pi&s;tols: But before the bargain was concluded
the Duke died in the 28 year of his age.</P>
<P>The Revenues of this Prince are &s;aid to be 350000
Crowns <HI>per ann.</HI> his ordinary expences not to exceed
180000.</P>
<P>In a Mountain in this Territory called <HI>Zibbo</HI> nigh
<HI>Paiuli</HI> Ca&s;tle &s;ome 28 miles di&s;tant from <HI>Modena</HI> is a

<P>We began our Journey to <HI>Parma,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 24.</NOTE> and at 7 miles
end forded the River <HI>Serchio,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by &s;trong lit|tle
Town on our left hand called <HI>Rubiera,</HI> and after
8 miles more entred <HI>Reggio.</HI> a city almo&s;t as big as

It is more extended in length, and makes a fairer
&s;hew, having one broad and long &s;treet. Heer there
are many Sculptors who make pretty carved works
in Ivory, and wood, for which this Town is noted.
Ten miles onward we pa&s;&s;ed a long Bridge over the
River <HI>Lenzo,</HI> and entred the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>'s Coun|trey;
and five miles more brought us to <HI>Parma,</HI> a

Near this Town we ferried over the River <HI>Oy</HI> or

a &s;mall Town, but one of the be&s;t fortified places we
have &s;een, carefully guarded by a good Garri&s;on

after the manner of the <HI>Holland</HI> Cities; as are al&s;o
the &s;treets of <HI>Parma, Piacenza,</HI> and <HI>Crema.</HI> It is en|compa&s;&s;ed

<PB N="240" REF="133">
building more &s;light and weak, the exterior of good
&s;trength, and thickne&s;s, with a broad trench before
it. The inhabitants are very bu&s;ie and indu&s;trious,
driving a great trade of making Guns and other iron
ware. The <HI>Bre&s;cian</HI> Guns are much e&s;teemed not on|ly
in <HI>Italy,</HI> but all over <HI>Europe,</HI> as well for the good|ne&s;s
of the iron and temper, as the excellency and
neatne&s;s of the workman&s;hip. The Markets are well
&s;tored with all things nece&s;&s;ary for humane life. The
territory of this City is in length from <HI>Mo&s;o</HI> near
<HI>Mantua</HI> to <HI>Dialengo</HI> in the upper end of <HI>Val Camonica</HI>
100 miles, in breadth from <HI>Limone</HI> upon the <HI>Lago

owners, and inrich the whole Coutrey. Few Ci|ties
in <HI>Italy</HI> have &s;o large and &s;o rich a territory, &s;o

City it &s;elf hath often changed Lords and Govern|ments,
and was for a long time mi&s;erably torn in
pieces, and wa&s;ted by inte&s;tine quarrels and fightings
between the Factions of the <HI>Guelfs</HI> and <HI>Ghibellines.</HI>
The <HI>Vi&s;conti</HI> of <HI>Milan</HI> made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of
it and held it for many years. In the time of <HI>Phil|lippus
Maria,</HI> the Citizens being much oppre&s;&s;ed and
aggrieved, and having often in vain &s;ent Emb&s;&s;a|dors
to him for redre&s;s, they finally delivered them|&s;elves
up to the <HI>Venetians</HI> in the year 1426. who now
keep in Garri&s;on for the &s;ecurity of this City 800
Souldiers, and 300 more in the Ca&s;tle, which &s;tands

<HEAD>OF
MILAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MILAN</HI> is one of the four principal Cities
of <HI>Italy;</HI> the other three being <HI>Rome, Venice</HI>
and <HI>Naples.</HI> It is called <HI>la grande,</HI> and well may it
be &s;o, being ten <HI>Italian</HI> miles in circuit: and yet
(which is more) the figure of it approaches to a cir|cle.
It conteins 11 Collegiate Churches, 71 Pari&s;hes,
30 Covents of Freres, 8 of Regular Canons, and
36 of Nuns. The number of Inhabitants of all &s;orts
is &s;aid to be 300000, but I believe they who report
it &s;peak by gue&s;s and at random. All provi&s;ions for
the belly are very plentiful and cheap heer: &s;o that
it is a proverbial &s;aying, <HI>Solo in Milano &s;i mangia,</HI>
They eat well only at <HI>Milan.</HI> The <HI>Domo</HI> or Cathe|dral
Church is next to S. <HI>Peters</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> the greate&s;t,
mo&s;t &s;umptuous ad &s;tately pile of building in <HI>Italy.</HI>
It is 250 cubits long, and 130 broad, according to
<HI>Schottus,</HI> and of an an&s;werable highth. A more par|ticular
de&s;cription whereof may be &s;een in <HI>Schottus.</HI>
The great Ho&s;pital is the large&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent,
I think, in <HI>Europe,</HI> more like a &s;tately Cloy&s;ter or
Princes Palace than an Ho&s;pital. There is one great
&s;quare Court, &s;urrounded with a double <HI>portico,</HI> the
one below, the other obove flairs; be&s;ides four or
five other &s;maller Courts. The Revenues of this
hou&s;e amount to more then 50000 crowns yearly;
and there are maintained in it about 4000 poor, in|firm
and &s;ick per&s;ons. In this City are many fair
and large Mona&s;teries, and a great number of
Churches [of all &s;orts 238] beautified with exqui|&s;ite
pictures and &s;tatues of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters, and fur|ni&s;hed
with rich Altar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> pieces, Reliques, Ve&s;ts, and

other Ornaments: The particulars may be &s;een in
<HI>Schottus</HI> and others. The Library called <HI>Bibliotheca
Ambro&s;iana</HI> is a hand&s;om building furni&s;hed with
&s;tore of Good Books, and free for all per&s;ons, as
well strangers as Citizens, to enter into and make
u&s;e of. It was founded by Cardinal <HI>Carolus Borro|mens,</HI>
of whom they have made a Saint. The Col|lege
called <HI>Hermathenaeum</HI> is a &s;tately building, ha|ving
a hand&s;ome Court, encompa&s;&s;ed with a double
<HI>Portico</HI> or Cloy&s;ter, one above the other. The pillars
of both <HI>Porticoes</HI> are double, the lowermo&s;t of the
<HI>Ionic,</HI> the upper of the <HI>Tu&s;can</HI> Order.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Milan</HI> is e&s;teemed one of the prin|cipal
Fortre&s;&s;es of <HI>Europe,</HI> as well for its &s;trength
(having never been taken by force) as for its great|ne&s;s
and beauty. This Ca&s;tle &s;ince its fir&s;t building
hath been twice enlarged; for the ancient Ca&s;tle,
built by the <HI>Vi&s;conti</HI>(which is now the Palace of the
Governour, and before which is Court having a
round &s;tone-tower at each corner;) the <HI>French</HI> taking
in a great &s;pace of ground, enclo&s;ed with a &s;quare
wall of a very great highth and thickne&s;s, and a deep
ditch. Upon the top of this wall one may walk un|der
cover round about, and from thence have a fair
pro&s;pect of the Countrey, and the new Fortificati|ons
of the Ca&s;tle, or the new line added by the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI>
being of a pentagonal figure, and having at
each angle a Ba&s;tion or Mount, and between every
two Ba&s;tions an half Moon. It is well furni&s;hed
round about with great Guns ready mounted. With|in
the Ca&s;tle is a water-mill, which they told us was
driven by water which &s;prings up within the Ca|&s;tle-walls.
<HI>Schottus</HI> &s;aith that the circuit of the whole
Fortre&s;s be&s;ides the trenches is 1600 paces. The Gar|ri&s;on

The <HI>New-&s;treet</HI> an&s;wers the fame that goeth of it. It

only deformity of this City is the narrowne&s;s of
the &s;treets unan&s;werable to the tallne&s;s of the hou&s;es;
and yet they are made &s;o on purpo&s;e, partly to &s;ave
ground, which heer is precious; and partly to keep
off the &s;corching beams of the Sun in Summer time,
for the conveniency of walking cool; for which
rea&s;on I have ob&s;erved many of the ancient Towns
of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Gallia Narbonen&s;is</HI> to have their &s;treets
made very narrow. This City lies under the moun|tains
expo&s;ed to the South, &s;o that it mu&s;t needs be
very hot in Summer, as witne&s;s the Orange and
Olive trees which grow &s;o plentifully heer, that they
can afford tho&s;e fruits at ea&s;ie rates, and drive there|with
a great trade, furni&s;hing with Oranges <HI>Florence</HI>

toward the land. The exterior or new wall of a

mountains, and takes in a great deal of void
ground.</P>
<P>The famous new mole, which now makes this a
&s;ecure Harbour, is &s;aid to have co&s;t as much as the
new wall: for a work of that nature I believe it is
not to be parallel'd in the whole world. The man|ners
of the Inhabitants are not an&s;werable to the
<PB N="253" REF="139">
beauty of their hou&s;es; they being noted among
their own Countrey-men the <HI>Italians</HI> for proud, un|faithful,
revengeful, uncivil to Strangers, and horri|bly
exacting. There goeth a proverbial &s;aying of
<HI>Genoa,</HI> that it hath, <HI>montagne &s;enza alberi, mare &s;enza

Men without faith, and Women without &s;hame.</HI>
The number of the Inhabitants mu&s;t needs be
great, they having lo&s;t in the la&s;t great Plague (as
we were credibly informed) to the number of

laws made by the Popes Legate, and the Emperors
and King of <HI>Spains</HI> Emba&s;&s;adors, not long after the

1. a <HI>Duke,</HI> who continues in office 2 years. 2. Two

8, all elected, be&s;ides tho&s;e that of cour&s;e
come in for their lives. 3. A greater <HI>Council</HI> of 400.
4. A le&s;&s;er <HI>Council</HI> of 100. 5. A <HI>Seminary</HI> for the
2 <HI>Collegia</HI> of 120. The 2 <HI>Collegia</HI> of <HI>Governatori</HI> and
<HI>Procuratori,</HI> are as it were the chief Senate or Privy
Council or Hou&s;e of Lords; and are cho&s;en twice a
year, <HI>viz.</HI> about the middle of <HI>June</HI> and about the
middle of <HI>December,</HI> after this manner. All the <HI>Se|minarium</HI>
of 120 have their names together with
their &s;urnames and fathers names written in little
&s;crolls of parchment, an put into an iron box,
which is kept very &s;ecurely under many locks. When
the time of election comes this box is brought forth
before the Duke, the 2 <HI>Collegia,</HI> and the le&s;&s;er Coun|cil.
Then a boy, who mu&s;t be under ten years of
age, puts his hand into the box, and draws out 5
&s;crolls, which are read, and the 3 fir&s;t, if they be
<PB N="254" REF="140">
capable, are <HI>Governatori,</HI> the 2 la&s;t <HI>Procuratori.</HI> If a
man be 100 miles off the City he is uncapable of be|ing
elected for that time. Likewi&s;e two of the &s;ame
family cannot be <HI>Procuratori</HI> or <HI>Governatori</HI> together.
Therefore if the two fir&s;t that are drawn out or the
two &s;econd be of the &s;ame family, the fir&s;t is <HI>Governa|tor,</HI>
and the &s;econd <HI>Procurator:</HI> if the two la&s;t be of the
&s;ame family, the fir&s;t drawn out is a <HI>Procurator,</HI> and
the &s;econd is returned into the box again, and the
boy draws out another. So that every &s;ix months five
are cho&s;en into the <HI>Collegia,</HI> and five go out, and eve|ry
one &s;tays in office two years. In the <HI>Collegium
Procuratorum,</HI> be&s;ides the 8, are all tho&s;e who have
been <HI>Dukes,</HI> and are gone out of office, who (<HI>mod&ograve; ben&egrave;

lives.</P>

year in the &s;tead of tho&s;e who are dead, made unca|pable,
or cho&s;en into the 2 <HI>Collegia,</HI> the le&s;&s;er Coun|cil
chu&s;es a double number, all which mu&s;t have 3
&s;uffrages of 5. And out of the&s;e the greater Council
chu&s;e half by the major vote.</P>
<P>For chu&s;ing the <HI>Councils</HI> both <HI>greater</HI> and <HI>le&s;&s;er,</HI> the
<HI>le&s;&s;er Council</HI> in pre&s;ence of the Duke and 2 <HI>Collegia</HI>
chu&s;e 30 <HI>Electors,</HI>(all which mu&s;t be of the Nobili|ty)
by 3 &s;uffrages of 5. The&s;e 30 chu&s;e both the
<HI>greater</HI> and <HI>le&s;&s;er Council,</HI> but the <HI>le&s;&s;er</HI> out of the
number of the <HI>greater,</HI> by a like proportion of &s;uf|frages.
The <HI>greater Council</HI> is a&s;&s;embled upon im|portant
occa&s;ions, and with the <HI>Duke</HI> and 2 <HI>Collegia</HI>
makes the &s;upreme power: The <HI>le&s;&s;er Council</HI> takes
care of the le&s;&s;er and ordinary concerns of the City
and Common-wealth. Tho&s;e who are capable of be|ing
cho&s;en into the <HI>greater Council</HI> mu&s;t be 25 years
of age; only the 30 Electors may, if they plea&s;e or
&s;ee it expedient, chu&s;e to the number of 60 who
are but 22 years old. Of the <HI>le&s;&s;er Council</HI> the one
half mu&s;t be 30 years of age, the others at lea&s;t 27,

be well qualified may be cho&s;en two years younger.
Tho&s;e who are capable of being cho&s;en into the <HI>Se|minarium</HI>
mu&s;t be 40 years of age.</P>
<P>The choice of the Duke is in this manner. The
<HI>great Council</HI> being a&s;&s;embled there are put into an
Urn 10 golden balls marked with 10 &s;everal letters.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e being drawn out is &s;hewn to the
Con&s;ervators of the Laws, who thereupon put
into another Urn &s;tanding by the Dukes throne 50
golden balls marked with the &s;ame letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This is done to prevent fraud, for if the gol|den balls were ei|ther not marked at all, or with any &s;ign or letter known before|hand, any one of the Coun|cil might bring &s;uch a ball with him, and taking it in his hand make &s;hew as if he drew it out of the Urn.</NOTE>, and 50
&s;ilver balls. The&s;e being &s;haken together, the <HI>le&s;&s;er

&s;hews it to the <HI>Cen&s;ors,</HI> who &s;it by, and pre&s;ently
writes in a &s;croll of paper the name of him whom
he thinks fit to nominate for Duke and goes out of
the Council. When all the golden balls are drawn
out, the two <HI>Collegia</HI> bring them into order, and
count them over, and if the number of the nomi|nated
amount to 20 then they are propounded to the
<HI>greater Council,</HI> who out of them by major vote
chu&s;e 15. Out of the&s;e 15 the <HI>le&s;&s;er Council</HI> chu&s;e 6

vote the <HI>greater Council</HI> chu&s;e the Duke. The&s;e &s;uf|frages
are all occult, that is, given by putting of balls
into balloting boxes. If in the <HI>greater Council</HI> for any
per&s;on the negative and affirmative &s;uffrages are
equal, then 5 by lot are to be put out of the Council,

better circum&s;tances then their neighbours, them|&s;elves

marble Font like the Ci&s;tern of a Fountain, with wa|ter
continually running into it. There is al&s;o a mar|ble
pulpit curiou&s;ly carved. 5. The burying place
called the <HI>Campo Santo,</HI> becau&s;e made of earth
brought out of the holy Land. The earth is &s;aid to
con&s;ume a body in 48 hours: it is an oblong &s;quare,

encline or lean to one &s;ide, that one would think it

<HI>Co&s;mus,</HI> and fini&s;hed by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> I. great <HI>Dukes</HI> of
<HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> bringing water to the City from the moun|tains

called anciently <HI>Portus Liburnus,</HI> &s;ome 10 or 12
miles di&s;tant. This Town is not large, and but low
built, yet very plea&s;ant and uniform, having &s;treight
&s;treets, and a &s;pacious <HI>Piazza</HI> in the middle. It
&s;tands in an open level, without mountain or hillock
within 5 miles of it on any &s;ide. It is well-fortified
with walls and ba&s;tions, and a deep trench round
except on the Sea-&s;ide; and &s;ecured with a good
Garri&s;on, being one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and
important places in all <HI>Tu&s;cany.</HI> Since the Great
<HI>Duke</HI> made it a free port it hath encrea&s;ed mightily
in trading and riches, great numbers, of Merchants
from all Nations re&s;orting hither, and mo&s;t of the
bargains for the commodities of the whole <HI>Levant</HI>
being heer driven. The greate&s;t part of the Inhabi|tants
are Strangers and Jews, which la&s;t are e&s;teem|ed
one third of the whole number of people, and
thought to amount to 5000 per&s;ons and upward.
Before the&s;e privileges granted to <HI>Ligorn,</HI> when it
was thin of Inhabitants, it was accounted a very bad
air and an unhealthful place, by rea&s;on of the fens
and mar&s;hes adjoyning; but now &s;ince it is become
populous, the multitude of fires (as is &s;uppo&s;ed)
hath &s;o corrected the air, that people enjoy their
health as well and live as long heer as in any other
Town or City of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>Near the Haven is a very magnificent &s;tatue of
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> I. Great Duke, about the pede&s;tal where|of
are 4 bra&s;s Statues of &s;laves chained of a gigan|tick

in this Town; heer being great variety of good
fi&s;h taken in the Sea near hand, and to be &s;old at

<P>At <HI>Ligorn</HI> finding a good <HI>Dutch</HI> Ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;et
&s;ail for <HI>Naples,</HI> we put our &s;elves aboard her: The
wind not favouring us we &s;pent five days in this
pa&s;&s;age before we reached our Port. The Captain of
the Ship told us that heerabouts u&s;ually in the fore|noon
the wind blows from the Land, and in the af|ternoon
from the Sea; &s;o that it is Ea&s;terly in the
forenoon, and We&s;terly in the afternoon. We al&s;o
ob&s;erved in this Voyage, that about Sun-&s;et the wind
fell; &s;o that &s;oon after Sun-&s;et there was little or no
wind &s;tirring: and likewi&s;e &s;everal days about Sun-ri&s;ing
we had but little wind. In our return back|wards
from <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> and from <HI>Naples</HI> to
<HI>Ligorn,</HI> we ob&s;erved that the wind for the mo&s;t part
&s;ate contrary to us. And the Sea men told us that
<PB N="266" REF="146" MS="y">
this was general in Summer time. So that you have
a much quicker pa&s;&s;age from <HI>Ligorn</HI> to <HI>Naples,</HI> and
thence to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> than backwards. We ob&s;erved al|&s;o
that the wind follows the Sun, &s;o that every morn|ing
we could make &s;ome u&s;e of the wind to &s;ail
with, but in the afternoon none at all; which a|grees
exactly with our Captains ob&s;ervation, the
land lying Ea&s;tward, and the Sea We&s;t. Our Cap|tain
al&s;o told us that when they made a Voyage from
<HI>Holland</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> they &s;ailed down the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> as far Southward, as the place in the
<HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> whither they intended to go lay, and
then &s;teer'd directly We&s;tward; both the wind
blowing con&s;tantly from the Ea&s;t, and the Sea al&s;o
running the &s;ame way. Which relation of his con|curring
with the general vogue of Mariners (if true)
doth much confirm the opinion of the diurnal moti|on
of the earth. When they return backwards from
thence into <HI>Holland,</HI> they go round about the Bay of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> and up a good way northward, and then &s;trike
over to <HI>Europe,</HI> the water being reflected (as he &s;aid)
that way, and the wind al&s;o often blowing that way.</P>
<P><HI>Naples</HI> lies by the Sea &s;ide under hills,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Naples.</NOTE> in form of
a Theater; for its figure and &s;ituation much like to
<HI>Genua,</HI> but &s;omewhat bigger, and much more po|pulous;
&s;o that before the la&s;t great Plague (which
&s;wept away as we were credibly informed at lea&s;t
120000 &s;ouls) one might well reckon the number of
Inhabitants to have been about three hundred thou|&s;and.
The circuit of the walls is not above &s;even
<HI>Italian</HI> miles, but it hath large Suburbs. The Town
is well built of &s;tone; the hou&s;es tall and ma&s;&s;y;
for the mo&s;t part flat rooft, and covered with a kind
of pla&s;ter, which fences out the rain, and endures
the weather well. Notwith&s;tanding this City lies &s;o
far South, and under hills, yet is not the heat ex|treme,
but &s;uch as may well be endured even in the
middle of Summer, they having for the mo&s;t part
<PB N="267" REF="146">
about noon-tide a brize of wind, which cools and
refre&s;hes much. Two or three hot days we had, but
the re&s;t temperate enough. They told us that there
u&s;es to be very little rain there in Summer time, how|beit
at our being there (which was in the latter end
of <HI>June</HI> and beginning of <HI>July</HI>) it rained every other
day, and &s;ometimes &s;o plentifully, that the water
ran down like a river in the &s;treets. When they have
no rain, to cool the &s;treets in the afternoon they
draw about a tun filled with cold water, and bored
with &s;everal holes, whence the water gu&s;hes out as
it goes along. The Dialect of the common people is
much different from the <HI>Tu&s;cane,</HI> and not to be un|der&s;tood
but by one who hath a long time conver&s;ed
with them. This City is well &s;erved with all provi|&s;ions,
e&s;pecially fruit which is very cheap heer. In
this place we took fir&s;t notice of the <HI>Cucurbita an|guina,
Cucumis anguinus, Mala in&s;ana, &amp; Limoncelle,</HI>
to be &s;old in market. <HI>Macarones</HI> and <HI>Vermicelle</HI> (which
are nothing but a kind of pa&s;te cut into the figure of
worms or thongs) boil'd in broth or water, are a
great di&s;h heer as well as at <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and as much
e&s;teemed by the vulgar, as Frumenty by the Coun|trey
people in <HI>England.</HI> All the <HI>Neopolitans</HI> and <HI>Si|cilians,</HI>
and genenrally the <HI>Italians</HI> drink their Wine
and water &s;nowed; and you &s;hall &s;ee many &s;talls in
the &s;treets where there is &s;nowed water to be &s;old:
many al&s;o you &s;hall meet, with a barrel at their

<P><HI>NB.</HI> To cool the water or wine they do not put
the &s;now into it, but round about the ve&s;&s;el wherein
it is contained: &s;o they have a ve&s;&s;el conteining the
&s;now or ice, and into that they &s;et the ve&s;&s;el contein|ing

<P>The Churches in this Town are generally very
hand&s;ome within &s;ide; many of them richly gilt
and &s;umptuou&s;ly adorned; &s;ome of them not only
paved with marble of divers colours, but their walls
encru&s;ted all over with marble inlaid. Of all the
Cloy&s;ters I have any where &s;een that of the <HI>Carthu&s;i|ans,</HI>
clo&s;e adjoyning to the Ca&s;tle S. <HI>Elmo,</HI> is the

of &s;everal colours well wrought, poli&s;h'd and laid,
and &s;o cleanly and elegantly kept, that one cannot &s;ee
a more plea&s;ant &s;pectacle of this nature. For my own
part I was much taken with the &s;ight of it. Heer is a
fair Ar&s;enal to build Gallies in, now made but little
u&s;e of. The public Granary de&s;erves notice taking,
it being the greate&s;t and be&s;t furni&s;hed of any we
have &s;een. They told us there was Corn enough al|ways
in &s;tore to &s;erve the whole City &s;ome years up|on
any exigency. There are great Vaults made under|ground
to keep it in in Winter time, and large
rooms above to keep it in Summer. A great number
of men they hire to turn all the beds of Corn every

that &s;o there may be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new Corn yearly.

<P>Every hearth (fires they call them) in this King|dom
of <HI>Naples</HI> pays 15 Carolines the year to the
King, which is about &s;ix and &s;ix pence or &s;even &s;hil|lings
<HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The number of fires in the whole
<PB N="271" REF="148">
Kingdom is 475727, be&s;ides 5804 which are exempt
from payment. In which number are not compre|hended
the fires of the <HI>Albane&s;e</HI> and <HI>Illyrians</HI> com|monly
called <HI>Sclavonians</HI> who pay no more then
11 Carolines the year, are numbred every year, and
are permitted to remove from place to place in the
Kingdom. The number of the&s;e extraordinary fires
is 4451. So then the whole &s;um of the Hearth|mony
is 719095 Ducats 4 Carolines, from which
deducting what is to be abated for places privileged
and exempt from payment, that which comes clear
into the Kings trea&s;ury will be 654873 Ducats, and
&s;ix Carolines.</P>
<P>The <HI>Adogo</HI> or tax which feudatories pay to the
King in lieu of per&s;onal &s;ervice amounts in the whole
Kingdom to 120568 Ducats: They al&s;o pay Reliefs
after Deaths one half of a years Revenue. Be&s;ides
the&s;e there are abundance more taxes and gabels
paid by the Subject; an account of all which in par|ticular
may be &s;een in <HI>Scipio Mazzella</HI> his De&s;cripti|on
of the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> written in <HI>Italian</HI>
and printed 1601. So that one would think it were
impo&s;&s;ible for poor Pe&s;ants to pick up &s;o much money
as they pay to the King only: and yet I believe the
gabels and payments are &s;ince that time much encrea|&s;ed.
The whole&s;um of all the Kings <HI>Entrata</HI> or Re|venue
yearly accruing from this Kingdom then was
2996937 Ducats, 3 Carolines and 14 grains.</P>
<P>While we &s;taid in this City we were pre&s;ent at
the meeting of the <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> or Philo&s;ophic Academy,
which is held weekly on Wedne&s;days in the Palace

were pre&s;ent at lea&s;t three&s;core. Fir&s;t there was &s;hew|ed
the experiment of the waters a&s;cending above its

di&s;cour&s;ed a while, three of the Society recited di&s;|cour&s;es

they had &s;tudied and compo&s;ed about parti|cular
&s;ubjects, which were appointed them to con&s;i|der
the week before: and after &s;ome objections
again&s;t what was delivered and rea&s;onings to and
fro about it, the company was di&s;mi&s;t. A man could
&s;carce hope to find &s;uch a knot of ingenious per&s;ons
and of that latitude and freedom of judgment in
&s;o remote a part of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in the communion
of &s;uch a Church. They are well acquainted with
writings of all the learned and ingenious men of the

with the conver&s;ation and di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ome of
them. Among&s;t the re&s;t Dr. <HI>Thomas Cornelius</HI> hath
made him&s;elf known to the world by his Writings.</P>
<P>We went by water to <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> anciently <HI>Puteoli;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April 24 Pozzuolo</NOTE>
there &s;o &s;oon as we were come into our Inn many
Sea-men and Countrey people came about us, &s;ome
bringing Shells, others <HI>Hippocampi</HI> dried, others an|cient
medals and <HI>Entaglie,</HI> others pieces of coloured
gla&s;s raked out of the Sea, (as they told us) about
<HI>Argenteria.</HI> Near this Town are &s;everal arches of
&s;tone [13 peers] reaching a great way into the Sea.
Some are of opinion that this was the beginning of
<HI>Caligula</HI>'s Bridge over this Bay, and that from the
end of this pile as far as <HI>Baiae</HI> the re&s;t of the Bridge
was made of ve&s;&s;els locked together and fa&s;tened
with Anchors on each &s;ide. But more probable it is
that this was intended for a mole or peer to &s;ecure
the Harbour, and for Ships to lie behind, becau&s;e
upon every peer a great &s;tone perforated &s;tands jet|ting
out of tie ve&s;&s;els unto. That it was an ancient
<HI>Roman</HI> work the manner of the Arches, the figure of
the bricks, and the &s;tateline&s;s of it do &s;ufficiently ar|gue.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="149">
From <HI>Pozzuolo</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed over the Gulf to <HI>Baiae,</HI>
where are &s;o many Antiquities, that to di&s;cour&s;e fully
of them would require a volume alone. And others
having written at large of them both in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Latine,</HI> I &s;hall not &s;o much as mention any thing &s;ave
only the &s;weating vault being one of the grots called
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">i. e. The Baths of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">itoli.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Bagne de Tritoli.</HI> It is a long and narrow pa&s;|&s;age
like the entry into &s;ome room, the upper part
whereof is &s;o hot, that a man cannot endure to walk
upright, being then in danger to be &s;tifled by the
hot and &s;uffocating vapour with which the upper
part of the Vault is filled: the lower part though
not cold is yet tolerable. Indeed one would not think
there could be &s;o great a difference in &s;o &s;mall a di|&s;tance.
He therefore that goes in there is nece&s;&s;itated
to &s;toop low; for if you do but hold up your hand it
&s;weats &s;uddenly. We ob&s;erved that of the lower
part of this vault where it was cool the &s;ides were a
firm &s;tone, but of the upper part where it was hot,
a &s;oft, friable, yet unctuous yellow clay. It &s;eemed to
us to have a mixture of &s;ulphur and fixt &s;alt deli|quated
in it, but we made no trial of it by fire or
otherwi&s;e. Where this <HI>&s;tratum</HI> or region of clay be|gins
there preci&s;ely doth the heat begin; &s;o that
where the region of clay goes lower there you mu&s;t
&s;toop lower to avoid the heat. In this hot &s;team
there is a watery vapour conteined, as appears by
the drops notwith&s;tanding all the heat conden&s;ed on
the &s;ides of the vault as on an Alembic head. As we
returned we viewed the new Mountain, called by
&s;ome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">i. e. The Mountain of a&s;hes or cin|ders.</NOTE> <HI>Monte di cenere,</HI> rai&s;ed by an Earth-quake
<HI>Septemb.</HI> 29. 1538, of about an hundred foot per|pendicular
altitude; though others make it much
higher, according to <HI>Stephanus Pighius</HI> it is a mile
a&s;cent to the top, and 4 miles round at the foot. We
judg'd it nothing near &s;o great. The people &s;ay it bears
nothing; nothing of any u&s;e of profit I &s;uppo&s;e they
mean, el&s;e I am &s;ure there grows <HI>Heath, Myrtle,
<PB N="274" REF="150">
Ma&s;tich-tree,</HI> and other &s;hrubs upon it. It is a &s;pungy
kind of earth, and makes a great &s;ound under a mans
feet that &s;tamps upon it. The &s;ame Earthquake threw
up &s;o much earth &s;tones, and a&s;hes as quite filled up
the <HI>Lacus Lucrinus,</HI> &s;o that there is nothing now left
of it but a fenny meadow. In our return from <HI>Poz|zuolo</HI>
we viewed the mountain called <HI>Solfatara,</HI> an|ciently
<HI>Campi Phlegraei,</HI> which continually burns.
On the top of the mountain is a large excavated oval
place like an Amphitheater, in length 1500 foot, in
breadth 1000; where the burning is. There are &s;e|veral
holes or vents where the &s;moke i&s;&s;ues out, as
out of a furnace. We gathered perfect flowers of
&s;ulphur to appearance, and &s;alt-Armoniac &s;ticking to
the mouths of the&s;e vents. If you thru&s;t a Sword or
any iron in&s;trument into one of the holes where the
&s;moke comes out, and &s;uddainly draw it back again,
you &s;hall &s;ee it all over bedewed or thick &s;et with
drops of water. Whence it is manife&s;t that this &s;moke
is not only a dry exhalation, but hath al&s;o good
quantity of the vapour of water mixt with it. We
ob&s;erved that the&s;e <HI>flores</HI> of <HI>Sulphur</HI> would not burn,
nor ea&s;ily melt over the fire, by rea&s;on of the ad|mixture
of &s;ome heterogeneous body with them.
The &s;tones and earth of this mountain are cru&s;ted
over with the&s;e flowers of Brim&s;tone, which they
gather and di&s;til Brim&s;tone out of. As one walks
heer the earth makes a noi&s;e, as if it were hollow
underneath, and one may perfectly hear as it were
the hi&s;&s;ing and boiling of &s;ome melted mineral, me|tal
or other liquor ju&s;t under ones feet. One that
&s;hould &s;ee this &s;moke, hear this noi&s;e and feel the
heat would wonder that the mountain &s;hould not
&s;uddenly break out into a flame. This great hollow
above was I &s;uppo&s;e excavated partly by force of the
burning, the earth &s;inking down, and partly by pa|ring
away the top to di&s;til for Brim&s;tone.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="150">
Five miles di&s;tant from <HI>Naples</HI> is the mountain
<HI>Ve&s;uvius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ve&s;uvius.</NOTE> &s;o famous in all ages for its burning. The
ground all about the &s;ides of it we found covered
with cinders and pumice &s;tones, which had been ca&s;t
out in the time of the burnings. We ob&s;erved al&s;o
great channels, like gulls made by &s;uddain torrents
and land-floods, which they told us were made by
water thrown out at the top of the mountain in the
conflagrations. Toward the top grew very few
plants. <HI>Aceto&s;a ovilla</HI> where nothing el&s;e was to be
&s;een: A little lower grew <HI>Colutea Scorpioides</HI> and
&s;ome &s;hrubs of <HI>Poplar.</HI> Near the top the a&s;cent was
&s;teep, and very toil&s;ome to get up. Upon the very
top is a great pit or hollow in form of an Amphi|theater,
of about a mile round, cau&s;ed by the fires
blowing up the upper part of the mountain &s;everal
times with great violence. There are &s;till about the
bottom of this great cavity &s;ome &s;mall <HI>&s;piracula</HI> of
&s;moke, but incon&s;iderable and which &s;eem'd not
to threaten any future eruption. We viewed the
cave called <HI>Grotta di cane</HI> near the <HI>Lago Agnano.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grot|ta di cane.</NOTE> This
Grot is narrow and &s;hort. Whatever others have
written or &s;aid to the contrary, a man may without
any great prejudice go into and continue in it a long
time, even in the further end of it, as &s;ome of us
did above an hours &s;pace. The veneno&s;e vapour
(whether it be purely &s;ulphureous or al&s;o Ar&s;enical)
a&s;cends not a foot from the ground, but &s;o high as
it a&s;cends one feels his feet and legs hot. If you hold
your head down near the ground where the vapour
is, you &s;hall pre&s;ently find a fierce &s;ulphureous twinge
in your no&s;e, ju&s;t as if you held your head over
burning brim&s;tone, or more violent, which makes
a man &s;tagger at fir&s;t &s;troke, and &s;tifles before one be
aware. We carried with us a dog, which by hold|ing
his no&s;e down we almo&s;t killed &s;uddainly; and
then throwing him into the lake to try whether that
would recover him (as is generally believed) the dog
<PB N="276" REF="151">
being not lively enough to &s;wim was there drowned.
I believe if we had left him in the air he would have
recovered. We then put in a pullet, which was mor|tified
immediately; next a frog, which held not
out long; and la&s;t of all a &s;erpent, which lived about
half an hour. The &s;team, if you hold a candle where
it comes, pre&s;ently puts it out. I believe this vapour
ari&s;es not only in this grot preci&s;ely, but al&s;o all
heerabout, as I am confident would be found were
there other grots dug out of the hill near it.</P>
<P>Going to this grot;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Grot or Hole through Mount <HI>Pau&s;ilypus</HI></NOTE> we pa&s;&s;ed through the vault
or artificial high-way wherewith the mountain <HI>Pau|&s;ilypus</HI>
is perforated, made by one <HI>Cocceius</HI> in 15 days.
It is &s;aid to be a mile in length, but we judged it not
above half an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile. It is highe&s;t at each end,
and lowe&s;t in the middle, and yet there about 12
foot high; broad enough for two carts meeting to
pa&s;s one another. About the middle of the Vault it
is &s;o dark (no light now coming in but at the ends)
that tho&s;e who meet cannot &s;ee one another; and
therefore le&s;t they &s;hould ju&s;tle or fall foul one upon
upon another, they that go toward the Sea cry <HI>Alla
marina,</HI> and they which go into the Countrey cry
<HI>Alla montagna,</HI> &s;o each take their left hand, and pa&s;s commodiou&s;ly.
The ports may be &s;een from end to
end, and any where in the mid-way; but in cloudy
weather it is &s;o dark in the middle that a man can
&s;carce &s;ee his hands held up to the light. This road
is much frequented; though the bottom be &s;tone
yet is it very du&s;ty. Near the end toward <HI>Naples</HI>
we &s;aw a window at the top. They that write of
this grot mention two windows made by <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI>

heer, and 18 at <HI>Palermo.</HI> They &s;tand much upon
their privileges granted them by <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth
Emperor; and one privilege they have, not to &s;hew
their privileges. They contend earne&s;tly to have the
&s;taple or monopoly of Silk heer, and had lately ob|tained
a grant thereof from <HI>Spain:</HI> but the <HI>Paler|mitans</HI>
&s;eeing how much this would redound to
their prejudice, have got it rever&s;ed. It &s;eems for|merly
all the Silk made in <HI>Sicily</HI> was vended at <HI>Me&s;|&s;ina,</HI>
but by degrees <HI>Palermo</HI> hath got part of this
trade to its &s;elf, and now pleads pre&s;cription for it.
There is a great emulation and enmity between the
<HI>Palermitans</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;ane&s;e,</HI> which involves the whole
I&s;land; &s;ome Cities taking part with one, and &s;ome

City in their public in&s;truments and writings are
the <HI>Noble</HI> and <HI>Exemplary</HI> City of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI> The In|habitants
are none of the mo&s;t civil, but extraordi|narily
proud, and ready to expel the Vice-roy if he
di&s;plea&s;es them. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath 4 Ca&s;tles
in and about this City, and the Citizens as many in
their hands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Go|vernment of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI></NOTE> The City Gates &s;tand open all night,
&s;o that its free for any man to enter in and go out at
plea&s;ure. Their government among them&s;elves is
by &s;ix <HI>Jurats,</HI> four of the Gentry, and two of the
Citizens. They are cho&s;en after this manner. Every
year there is a certain number who do <HI>ambire ma|gi&s;tratum,</HI>
or (as they phra&s;e it) concur to come in
cap; &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes fewer. The Gen|tlemen
chu&s;e by them&s;elves, and the Citizens by
them&s;elves. The names of all the Gentlemen of
aboue 25 years of age, and likewi&s;e of all the Ar|ti&s;ans
and Trade&s;men, are written in little &s;crolls of
paper, and tho&s;e rolled up and ca&s;t upon a table.
<PB N="280" REF="153">
Then comes in the Kings delegate and takes up of
each heap of the&s;e &s;crolls to the number of 36, and
tho&s;e are the Electors. The&s;e Electors are brought
into a room where are boxes &s;et according to the
number of Competitors, and have balls given them
blue and white; the blue affirmative, and the white
negative; and they give to every one of the Candi|dates
their &s;uffrages as they plea&s;e. Tho&s;e eight of
the Noblemen and four of the Citizens which have
mo&s;t &s;uffrages are elected, and come in cap. Now on
the fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> the&s;e 12 have their names written in
little &s;crolls of paper put in a cap; and a little boy puts
his hand in, and takes out one by one to the num|ber
of &s;ix; and tho&s;e &s;ix are the Jurats for that year.
The Jurats for the Nobility though they be the grea|ter
number, yet can they do nothing without the
con&s;ent of one of the Jurats for the Citizens. After
all this &s;tir the&s;e Jurats have but little power, nothing
to do either in civil or criminal cau&s;es of any mo|ment.</P>

When they e&s;py a Tortoi&s;e floting on the top
of the water (as they can ea&s;ily do at a good di|&s;tance)
with as little noi&s;e as they can po&s;&s;ibly they
bring their boat up clo&s;e to him; then they either
catch him with their hands and draw him up into
the boat, or if they cannot get near enough to do
&s;o, one leaps out of the boat into the Sea, and turns
the Tortoi&s;e on his back, and then with ea&s;e drives
him before him up to the boat; the Tortoi&s;e being
not able to turn him&s;elf or &s;wim away on his back.
They &s;ay (and it is not unlikely) that the Tortoi&s;e
while he flotes thus upon the water &s;leeps; which is
the rea&s;on why they are &s;o &s;till and make &s;o little
noi&s;e in bringing their boat up to him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bernacle|&s;hells growing upon the back of a Tortoi&s;e.</NOTE> One of the&s;e

they are, but only growing in bigne&s;s as other &s;hells
do. All the ground of this fancy (as I conceive)
is becau&s;e this fi&s;h hath a bunch of <HI>cirri,</HI> &s;ome|what
re&s;embling a tuft of Feathers, or the tail
a Bird, which it &s;ometimes puts out into the

<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>Malta</HI> is 20 miles long, 12
miles broad, and 60 miles in circuit; di&s;tant
from the <HI>primo terreno</HI> or neare&s;t part of <HI>Sicily</HI> 60

<HI>Promontorium Mercurii,</HI> the neare&s;t point of the Con|tinent

mo&s;t skilful and experienced Pilots did affirm to
<HI>Abela</HI> for an undoubted truth) from the Cape of
<HI>Spartivento</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> but 190. So that upon account
of vicinity it is rather to be attributed to <HI>Europe</HI>
than <HI>Africa;</HI> e&s;pecially if we allow <HI>Sicily</HI> to have
been of old time united to and &s;o part of the Con|tinent.
The rea&s;on why others make it a member of
<HI>Africa</HI> is becau&s;e the pre&s;ent Inhabitants of the
Countrey &s;peak a kind of <HI>More&s;co</HI> or <HI>Arabic.</HI></P>
<P>The old City, called <HI>Citt&agrave; notabile,</HI> &s;ituate about

of Northern latitude, and the longe&s;t day
there is of 14 hours, 52 minutes.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that <HI>Heylin</HI> and others, who

Anno</HI> 1646. in <HI>folio.</HI></P>
<P>The whole I&s;land from the &s;hallowne&s;s of its &s;oil,
there being in few places above two foot depth of
<PB N="294" REF="160">
of earth before you come to firm &s;tone; and from
the lowne&s;s of its &s;ituation, not much elevated above
the level of the water and having no con&s;iderable
hill in it, &s;eems to have been in the mo&s;t ancient
times nothing el&s;e but a great Rock, wholly over|whelmed
and covered with the Sea; e&s;pecially if
we con&s;ider the multitude of Sea &s;hells of all &s;orts,
Sharks teeth, vertebres of Thornbacks and other
fi&s;h bones petrified found all over the I&s;land even in
the highe&s;t parts of it, and mo&s;t remote from the
&s;hore. For that the&s;e were formed by &s;ome pla&s;tick
power in the &s;tone-quarries, being nothing el&s;e but
the effects or productions of nature &s;porting her
&s;elf in imitation of the parts and &s;hells of the&s;e ani|mals,
I can hardly be induced to believe; nature
(which indeed is nothing el&s;e but the ordinary power
of God) not being &s;o wanton and toyi&s;h as to form
&s;uch elegant figures without further end of de&s;ign
than her own pa&s;time and diver&s;ion. But a very like|ly
thing it is, that the Sea being &s;hallow above this
Rock for &s;ome ages before it came to be uncovered,
there &s;hould great beds of Shell-fi&s;h harbour and
breed in &s;o convenient a place, and the water leaving
them their &s;hells remain and petrifie. I confe&s;s its
hard to imagine, how the carca&s;&s;es of &s;o many
Sharks &s;hould come to be lodged heer as by the mul|titude
of teeth that have been for &s;o many years pa&s;t,
and are &s;till daily digg'd up, we mu&s;t needs grant;
unle&s;s perchance they remain of the heads of &s;uch
Sharks as were caught and eaten by the Fi&s;her-men,
who it is likely after the di&s;covery of this Rock fre|quented
heer and made it a &s;tation for fi&s;hing before
it came to be inhabited.</P>
<P>To this difficulty Mr. <HI>Steno</HI> returns an&s;wer in the&s;e
particulars, 1. That &s;uch Sharks or Sea dogs have
each of them 60 teeth and more, and that all the
time they live they breed new teeth. 2. That the Sea
agitated by the winds is wont of protrude tho&s;ebo|bodies
<PB N="295" REF="160" MS="y">
it meets with towards &s;ome one place, and
there heap them together. 3. That Sharks &s;wim in
great troops or &s;holes, and con&s;equently that the
teeth of many of them may have been left in one
place. 4. That in the <HI>Malta</HI> earth be&s;ides the&s;e
Sharks teeth are found al&s;o &s;undry Cochle-&s;hells;
&s;o that if the number of teeth &s;hould encline a man
to a&s;cribe their production to the earth, on the other
hand, the make of the &s;ame teeth, and the abun|dance
of them in every animal, and the earth like
the bottom of the Sea, and other marine bodies
found in the &s;ame place do favour the contrary opi|nion.</P>

moi&s;tned with clouds, and on which the Sun|beams
have but little force: and yet I have made it
part of my bu&s;ine&s;s in viewing the highe&s;t hills in
<HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> to examine this particular. Nor
have I yet ever ob&s;erved &s;uch &s;pringing and running
waters in any plain, unle&s;s there were hills &s;o near,
that one might rea&s;onably conclude they were fed by
them. 2. Many &s;prings quite fail in dry Summers,
and generally all abate con&s;iderably of their waters.
I am not ignorant that &s;ome make a di&s;tinction be|tween
failing &s;prings and enduring &s;prings, and
would have the former to proceed from rain, and the
latter from the Sea, but I &s;ee no &s;ufficient foundati|on
for &s;uch a di&s;tinction, and do think that both the
one and the other are to be attributed to rain; the
failing and enduring being to be referred either to
the different quantity and thickne&s;s of earth that
feeds them; or to the different quality, the one more
quickly the other more &s;lowly tran&s;mitting the wa|ter,
or &s;ome &s;uch like accident. 3. In clay grounds,
into which the water &s;inks with difficulty, one &s;hall
&s;eldom find any &s;prings, but in &s;andy, gravelly, rocky,
&s;tony or other grounds into which the rain can ea&s;ily
make its way; one &s;eldom fails of them. 4. They
who would have fountains to ari&s;e from and to be fed
by the Sea have not as yet given a &s;atisfactory account
of the a&s;cent of water to the tops of mountains and
its efflux there. For though water will creep up a
filtre above its level, yet I que&s;tion whether to &s;o
great an exce&s;s above its <HI>aequilibrium</HI> with the air,
whereas in pumps we &s;ee it will not ri&s;e above two
or three and thirty foot; or if it &s;hould, whether it
<PB N="298" REF="162">
would there run out at the top of the filtre, we not
having as yet heard of any experiment that will
countenance &s;uch a thing. For the a&s;cent and efflux
of &s;ap in trees I &s;u&s;pect may be owing to a higher
principle then purely mechanical. As for the <HI>Sabu|lum
Quellem</HI> or <HI>Arena bulliens</HI> of <HI>Helmont,</HI> I look upon
it as an extravagant conceit of his; and yet &s;ome
ground there is to believe, that there is a kind of
earth lying up and down in veins, which doth like
a filtre retain the water and carry or derive it along
as it lies from place to place, till it brings it to the
<HI>&s;uper&s;icies</HI> of the earth, where it runs out. In other
places there are &s;ubterraneous channels like the veins
in animals, whereinto the water &s;oaking into the
earth is gathered, and wherein it runs as above
ground out of &s;maller rivulets into greater &s;treams:
and where one of the&s;e veins opens in the <HI>&s;uperficies</HI>
of the earth there is a &s;pring greater or le&s;&s;er accord|ing
to the magnitude of the vein. Nor need we won|der
that &s;prings &s;hould endure the length of a dry
Summer, for in many &s;orts of earth the water makes
its way but &s;lowly; &s;ince we &s;ee that in tho&s;e troughs
or leches, wherein Landre&s;&s;es put a&s;hes, and there|upon
water to make a <HI>lixivium,</HI> the water will be of|ten
many hours before it gets all through the a&s;h, and
the Lech cea&s;es to drop; and in many Chymical pre|parations
which are filtred, its long before the li|quor
can free it &s;elf and wholly drain away from the
earthy and feculent part.</P>
<P>Some attribute the original of fountains to wa|tery
vapours elevated by &s;ubterraneous fires, or at
lea&s;t by that generally diffu&s;ed heat which Miners
find in the earth when they come to 50 or 60 fa|thoms
under ground; and conden&s;ed by the tops and
&s;ides of the mountains as by an Alembick head, and
&s;o di&s;tilling down and breaking out where they find
i&s;&s;ue. And in rea&s;on one would think, that generally
the deeper one digs in the earth the colder one &s;hould
<PB N="299" REF="162">
find it, &s;ith the Urinators affirm that the deeper
they dive in the Sea the colder &s;till they find the wa|ter.
And yet were there &s;uch &s;ubterraneous heats,
they are not &s;o great as that it is likely they &s;hould
elevate vapours &s;o high, through &s;o thick a coat of
earth, which it mu&s;t be an inten&s;e heat indeed will
carry them through, which heat none &s;ay is found
near the &s;uperficies of the earth.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Hook</HI>'s account, <HI>viz.</HI> that &s;alt water being hea|vier
than fre&s;h, by rea&s;on of its preponderancy it may
drive up the fre&s;h as high above the &s;urface of the
Sea as are the tops of mountains before it comes to
an <HI>aequilibrium</HI> with it, is very ingenious, and would
be mo&s;t likely, were there continued clo&s;e channels
from the bottom of the Sea to the tops of mountains,
not admitting the air, which I believe will not be
found in many places.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ebbing and flow|ing Well<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> What is &s;aid about ebbing and

more air is nece&s;&s;ary for re&s;piration and refre&s;hment
of the body; there being le&s;s of that <HI>men&s;truum</HI>
which &s;erves to nouri&s;h or continue fire and con&s;e|quently
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he vital heat of Animals (which hath great
likene&s;s thereto) in hot air then in cold; whence we
&s;ee that fire burns furiou&s;ly in cold weather and but

in hot weather and hot Countreys, or becau&s;e
the reflected Sun-beams &s;pend and con&s;ume a good

the <HI>men&s;truum</HI> al&s;o more diffu&s;ed in hot weather is
clear in experience. I need mention no other expe|riment

<P>That this I&s;land produces or nouri&s;hes no Serpent
<PB N="313" REF="169">

Shipwrack, but rather that <HI>Melita</HI> before men|tioned
upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> for which there
is al&s;o &s;ome ground in the Scripture, which &s;aith
<HI>Acts</HI> 27. 26.</P>
<P>For that St. <HI>Paul</HI> upon the Vipers fa&s;tning on his
hand did by his Prayers obtain of God, that all the
Serpents in <HI>Malta</HI> &s;hould be turned into &s;tones, and
the I&s;land for the future wholly free from all vene|mous
bea&s;ts, is a Monki&s;h fancy, grounded upon
the forementioned petrified fi&s;h-bones, which they
fondly imagined were &s;ometime parts of Serpents:
whereas in other places where plenty of &s;uch &s;tones
are found there is no lack of Serpents. I confe&s;s it is
difficult to imagine how Serpents &s;hould come at fir&s;t
to breed heer, if the whole I&s;land were once (as we
conceive) a &s;ubmarine Rock covered with the Sea;
and there be no &s;pontaneous generation of animals,
as wel al&s;o believe: becau&s;e it can &s;carce be imagined
that any man &s;hould on purpo&s;e bring over Serpents
hither; unle&s;s perchance to &s;hew them for a curio|&s;ity.
Whether there be venemous bea&s;ts or no I am
&s;ure there are venemous in&s;ects heer, the very biting
ox &s;tinging of the Gnats (with which the City is
much infe&s;ted) being more virulent then in other
places. For my part I do not remember that in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
the biting of a gnat did ever cau&s;e a &s;welling, or
leave a mark behind it in the skin of my face (though
I know in &s;ome it doth) but there it both rai&s;ed a
&s;welling, and left a mark behind it that was not out
for a month after. The <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> ea&s;ily defend them|&s;elves
from the annoyance and bitings of this in&s;ect,
keeping them out of their beds by large linnen cur|tains
lapping over one another. At fir&s;t we were

was told us to be 30 miles di&s;tant. We a&s;cended for
the mo&s;t part all along from <HI>Catania,</HI> and we found
the ground rich, and well cultivated, and the Coun|trey
well inhabited; for the &s;lag and cinders ca&s;t out
of the mountain, being in proce&s;s of time di&s;&s;ol|ved
by the weather, doth mightily fatten and enrich
the &s;oil. We rode up &s;o high till we came to the con|&s;ervatories
of &s;now; and &s;eeing the mountain above
us all covered with &s;now; we did not, nor indeed
could we a&s;cend any higher. The trees heerabout
had at this time &s;carce put out their leaves. As we
went up we found in one place the ground covered
for a quarter of a mile broad, and 4 or 5 miles in
length, with cinders, which had been thrown forth
by the mountain, and was cartainly the relique of a
huge &s;tream of melted coals, iron, &s;tones and &s;ulphure
poured out in the time of the la&s;t eruption, nothing
as yet growing among the&s;e &s;tones and cinders. This
mountain ha&s;h in former times thrown forth &s;tones
and &s;lag as far as <HI>Catania</HI> it &s;elf, as we could mani|fe&s;tly
&s;ee; but of all the eruptions that ever were I
believe this la&s;t which happened [<HI>Anno</HI> 1669.] &s;ince

for a full de&s;cription and exact account wherof I

incendiis Aetnae.</HI> This mountain is of a very great
height, and we were told by credible per&s;ons, that
one might &s;ee it at Sea over the whole I&s;land any way
one came thither. We could clearly di&s;cern the top
of it as far as the I&s;land of <HI>Malta,</HI> which in a right
line mu&s;t needs be at lea&s;t 100 miles di&s;tant. One
thing we could not but wonder at, that there &s;hould

be content with your money, but will al&s;o &s;eize your
per&s;on and detain you pri&s;oner in the mountains till
you give them a good ran&s;om for your deliverance.</P>
<P>We took notice of &s;ome Laws and Cu&s;toms pro|per
to <HI>Sicily</HI> during our &s;tay heer.</P>
<P>1. It is unlawful to carry out of this I&s;land in
money more then ten crowns a per&s;on; if any one
carries out more and be taken, all is forfeited. But
the &s;earchers are not &s;o &s;trict, but that if you give
them a little money they will let you pa&s;s, e&s;pecially
if you be a &s;tranger and traveller, without any
&s;earching at all.</P>
<P>2. It is unlawful to kill any Calves in this I&s;land,
&s;o that no Veal can be procured heer. And yet at
<HI>Malta</HI> they have Veal enough, tran&s;ported hence by
&s;tealth.</P>
<P>3. It is unlawful to take above one ounce of &s;ilver
without weighing of it; &s;o that if you buy any
thing which comes to more, though your money be
never &s;o good, you &s;hall &s;ee them <HI>pro forma</HI> put it in
their &s;cales.</P>
<P>4. No per&s;on under age [<HI>imberbis Iuvenis</HI>] may
be received in any time in <HI>Sicily,</HI> unle&s;s he hath a
patent and licen&s;e to travel.</P>
<P>5. It is prohibited under pain of death to any
man to carry pi&s;tols about him; but long guns they
may and do all carry. The rea&s;on is becau&s;e a pi&s;tol
<PB N="316" REF="171">
may ea&s;ily be hid, and &s;o men murthered unawares.</P>
<P>6. All the money current in <HI>Sicily</HI> is coined at
<HI>Me&s;&s;ina.</HI></P>
<P>After our return to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina, May</HI> 27. we
pa&s;&s;ed by boat over the <HI>Fretum</HI> to &s;ee <HI>Rhegio</HI> or
<HI>Rhezo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rhegium, now Rhe|zo.</NOTE> anciently <HI>Regium,</HI> an old City, but now Ve|ry
mean and poor. All they have to boa&s;t of at pre|&s;ent
is their Gardens well &s;tored with all &s;orts of the
be&s;t fruits; their Silk, of which plenty is made heer
and (if we may believe them&s;elves) the be&s;t in <HI>Italy</HI>
or <HI>sicily:</HI> And S. <HI>Pauls.</HI> pillar which burned, of
which they have but a &s;mall fragment remaining.
They told us many &s;tories and legends of it, which
we gave little heed to.</P>
<P>We took boat and went as far as <HI>Scylla,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">May 29. The man|ner of catching the Sword|fi&s;h.</NOTE> to &s;ee the
fi&s;hing of the <HI>Pe&s;ce Spada</HI> or Sword-fi&s;h. The maner
whereof is thus. On the top of the Cliffs by the
Sea-&s;ide &s;tand <HI>Speculatores (Huers</HI> our Fi&s;her-men
call them) to e&s;py the Fi&s;h, who &s;o &s;oon as they &s;ee
them, either by voice if they be near, or by known
&s;igns if at di&s;tance, give notice to the Fi&s;hing-boats
whereabouts the fi&s;h are. The boat pre&s;ently makes
towards the place; then one gets up to the top of a
little ma&s;t in the boat, made with &s;teps on purpo&s;e,
and there &s;tands to ob&s;erve the motion of the fi&s;h and
direct the rowers, who accordingly ply their oars.
When they are come very near him, he upon the
ma&s;t comes down, and taking the harping iron in
his hand, if he can &s;trikes it into him. The fi&s;h be|ing
wounded, plays up and down and wearies him|&s;elf,
and when he is faint and &s;pent they draw him
up into the boat: This is much like the Whale-fi&s;h|ing.
The harping iron is put on a &s;taff or pole of
wood. The point of it is &s;harp and hath beards on
each &s;ide like a barbed arrow, &s;o joynted that if you
hold the point upward they clap clo&s;e to the &s;haft, if
downward they fall off from it on each &s;ide, &s;o that
they re&s;i&s;t not the going in of the iron but only the
<PB N="317" REF="171">
drawing out. This fi&s;h is held a great dainty by
the <HI>Me&s;&s;ane&s;e,</HI> as much longed for and as greedily
bought up by them as <HI>Soland</HI> goo&s;e by the <HI>Scots;</HI>
&s;old in <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> at fir&s;t coming in for &s;ix pence <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

taken on the coa&s;t of <HI>Calabria;</HI> about the latter end
of <HI>June</HI> it comes over to the <HI>Sicilian</HI> &s;ide and is ta|ken
about the <HI>Faro</HI> till <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> There becau&s;e there
be no rocks or cliffs hanging over the Sea, they pre|pare
a large boat or brigandine, and pitch up in it a
tall ma&s;t with &s;hrowds like the ma&s;t of a &s;hip, on the
top of which the <HI>Speculator</HI> or Huer &s;tands.</P>
<P>In the beginning of <HI>June</HI> yearly is celebrated at
<HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> a great Fe&s;tival called The Fea&s;t of our Lady
of the Letter: it continues near a weeks time with
great &s;olemnity. During this time all the hou&s;e|keepers
hang out in all the &s;treets a multitude of
lamps, candles, and tapers, and &s;et their windows as
full of lights in paper-lanthorns as they can hold,
which burn all night, &s;o that the &s;treets are as light|&s;ome
almo&s;t by night as by day. Nay the light was
&s;o great, that at a good di&s;tance from the Town as
we came thither late at night, the reflection thereof
from the clouds and atmo&s;phere appeared to us like
the <HI>Aurora</HI> or <HI>Crepu&s;eulum,</HI> though we &s;aw not the
lights them&s;elves, and it was no dark night, the
moon as I remember &s;hining. They call it the Fea&s;t
of our Lady of the Letter, becau&s;e it is held in me|mory
of a Letter written to them (as they &s;ay) by
the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> which how &s;orry and ungrounded
a fiction it is the pretended Letter it &s;elf (of which
al&s;o they confe&s;s them&s;elves not to have the Greek
original, but only a Latine copy) will be&s;t demon|&s;trate

we were told 56, whereas there are but 24 Mona|&s;teries

rather to bridle then defend it; one on the South|&s;ide,
held by a good Garri&s;on, neatly kept and di|ligently

<P>In the Dukes <HI>Theriotrophium</HI> we ob&s;erved the&s;e
&s;orts of wild bea&s;ts, <HI>Lion, Tiger, Leopard, Bear, Wolf,
Porcupine, Wild Boar.</HI> The &s;nout of this was longer
in proportion than that of tame or dome&s;tic Swine:
the ears rounder and &s;horter and of a black colour,
as were al&s;o the feet and tail. The&s;e wild Swine are
con&s;tantly of the &s;ame colour, which is a gri&s;ly or
iron-grey. Its worth the ob&s;ervation that mo&s;t wild
Animals keep to the &s;ame colour both Bea&s;ts and
Birds; but tho&s;e that are kept tame vary infinitely,
which is (I &s;uppo&s;e) to be attributed partly to the va|riety
of their food, and partly to the highne&s;s of
their feeding; to which the difference of the Cli|mate
and Soil may contribute &s;omething. So we &s;ee
that upon the <HI>Alps</HI> and other high mountains cover|ed

<P>This City at pre&s;ent is rather in a decaying than
thriving condition, there having not been (as we
were credibly-informed) a new hou&s;e built there
the&s;e 40 years: the Citizens generally being but
poor. This comes to pa&s;s partly by the great decay
<PB N="336" REF="181">
of their trade; for whereas formerly they &s;erved
<HI>France</HI> with Silks, now the <HI>French</HI> them&s;elves work
them as well or better than they; partly by rea&s;on
of the great exactions of the <HI>Great Duke,</HI> who lays
immoderate gabels upon all commodities that are
bought and &s;old. The greate&s;t Foreign trade they
have at pre&s;ent is with our nation; and that is not
much, we having mo&s;t of our Silk from <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,
Aleppo,</HI> and other places in the <HI>Levant</HI> and working
it at home. This City is well &s;ituate in a good air,
only &s;omewhat &s;harp in winter time; the Inhabi|tants
are ingenious and quick-witted. It hath bred
more excellent Painters, Sculptors and Architects
then any one City in <HI>Italy</HI> be&s;ides: and for Scholars
and great wits it may vie with mo&s;t.</P>
<P>It's the fa&s;hion heer for Gentlemen to &s;ell their
own wine by retail. Yet no body goes into the pa|lace
to drink; but there is a hole made in the Cellar
or Buttery-wall, to give in and take out flasks or
other ve&s;&s;els; and there is a &s;ervant attending for the
mo&s;t part &s;o long as there is wine to &s;ell. At the pa|lace
gate or wall they u&s;ually hang up the hackles of
old flasks to give notice that there is wine to be &s;old
there.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen think it a di&s;paragement to them
to practi&s;e Phy&s;ic; &s;o that none of them bring up
their children to the &s;tudy of medicine; but they
think it no di&s;paragement to exerci&s;e merchandi&s;e;
and for this they have the example of the <HI>Great
Duke</HI> him&s;elf, who is the greate&s;t Merchant in <HI>Eu|rope;</HI>
nay <HI>Leti</HI> &s;aith, That it is reported, he trades
for more then all the Merchants in <HI>Genoa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Great Duke</HI> is both heer and in all his domini|ons
&s;upreme and ab&s;olute Lord, and may <HI>pro arbi|trio</HI>
impo&s;e what taxes and gabels he plea&s;es; and
therein he is not &s;paring. Every hou&s;e pays to him
the tenth of its yearly rent. No hou&s;e or land &s;old
but a good part of the price (at lea&s;t one tenth) goes
<PB N="337" REF="181">
to him. No woman married but he hath 8 <HI>per cent.</HI>
of her portion. Every one that goes to Law pays
2 <HI>per cent.</HI> of what he fues for. Every young Heifer
that is &s;old pays a crown; Not &s;o much as a basket
of eggs comes to market but it pays &s;omewhat for
toll. So that his Revenue mu&s;t needs be great:
&s;ome &s;ay a million and half, others two millions of
crowns yearly. His expences amount not to one
million; and con&s;equently, con&s;idering al&s;o the in|come
of his trading, he mu&s;t needs have an immen&s;e
trea&s;ure; by <HI>Leti's</HI> reckoning more then 60 millions
of crowns: but its well if it amounts to half that
&s;um. And though &s;ome at <HI>Florence</HI> would have per|&s;waded
us that the world was mi&s;taken in this opini|on of his great riches, yet we sew good rea&s;on to
continue in that belief; he u&s;ing all ways of thrift
and &s;paring as well as getting; keeping no hou&s;e but
allowing his &s;ervants board-wages, and being at a
&s;et rate with his Cook, and his Baker, who for the
monopoly of fine bread (<HI>Pane di bocca</HI> they call it)
furni&s;hes his private table, and pays 1000 <HI>Scudi per
annum</HI> be&s;ides. Moreover it was a maxime with
him, that a good trea&s;ure of mony is the greate&s;t
&s;trength and &s;ecurity of a Prince, and he would
often &s;ay of our late King <HI>Charles</HI> I, that want of

<P>The Gentlemen and Citizens of quality keep not
their daughters at home after they be 8 or 10 years
of age, but put them into Nunneries, where they
are bred and taught all manner of womens work. Out
thence they come not till they be married. He that
makes love to any of them may with the parents
con&s;ent &s;ee and &s;peak with them at the grate of the
Nunnery. This is not only a &s;ecure but al&s;o a cheap
way to bring up their daughters. For they pay not
to the hou&s;e above 16 pounds a year for diet and
all.</P>

building of brick not exactly round but decagonal.
The roof of it is a vault or <HI>cupola</HI> not &s;o great as
that of the <HI>Rotonda</HI> and yet not much le&s;s. It had
two doors diametrically oppo&s;ite, and in the other

the form of an obtu&s;e pyramid. It is &s;aid, and I think

<P>The <HI>ville</HI> (as they now call them) of the Princes

<HI>Alaternus&punc;</HI> Laurel, Bay, <HI>Phillyrea, Laurus tinus</HI> and

(&s;ome being in compa&s;s 3 or 4 miles) excel the
orchards, gardens and walks of any Prince in Chri|&s;tendom
that I have &s;een. Of the&s;e there are a great
number, but the chief of all are 1. The <HI>Villa Bor|ghe&s;e,</HI>
of which family was Pope <HI>Paul</HI> V. This is
e&s;teemed the be&s;t of all the <HI>villae</HI> and gardens about
<HI>Rome,</HI> though it be not &s;o va&s;t as 2. the <HI>villa Pam|phylia,</HI>
of which family was Pope innocent X. This
is on the <HI>Janiculum</HI> without S. <HI>Pancras</HI>'s gate and is
&s;aid to be 4 miles in compa&s;s. 3. The <HI>Villa Ludo|vi&s;ia</HI>
belonging to the Prince <HI>Ludovi&s;io;</HI> of which
family was <HI>Gregory</HI> XV. 4. The Popes garden at
the Vatican called <HI>Belvedere.</HI> 5. The Popes garden

8. The garden of the <HI>Mattei.</HI> In all which there are
little palaces furni&s;hed and adorned with excellent
&s;tatues, <HI>ba&s;&s;i rilievi,</HI> pictures and other curio&s;ities,
which I forbear to enumerate and de&s;cribe at large,
that I may not &s;pend time, and wa&s;te paper in wri|ting
what few will think worth their while or pains

Mr. <HI>La&s;&s;els</HI> in his <HI>voyage</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> to which I refer
the curious for further &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>Of the palaces and public buildings I &s;hall &s;ay
nothing, only I cannot forbear a word or two of S.
<HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Church,</HI> which is in my opinion the mo&s;t
&s;tately, &s;umptuous and magnificent &s;tructure that
now doth, or perhaps ever did &s;tand upon the face
of the earth. This was the only building that &s;ur|pri&s;ed
me and exceeded my expectation, being for
a work of man the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and goodly, not to
&s;ay ravi&s;hing object that ever I beheld. The whole
pile of that maje&s;tic bulk and greatne&s;s that it ex|ceeds
in all dimen&s;ions the mo&s;t famous Temples
mentioned by the ancients: being in length 520 foot
(as Mr. <HI>La&s;&s;els</HI> tells us) and 385 in breadth: and in
&s;ome, the greate&s;t Chri&s;tian Churches; for though it
be not &s;o long as S. <HI>Pauls London,</HI> yet is it much
broader, and in that re&s;pect much hand&s;omer; the
breadth being more proportionate to the length.
The <HI>cupola</HI> of that marvellous highth and compa&s;s
(the diameter thereof be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng equal to that of the
<HI>Pantheon</HI>) and &s;u&s;taining on the top a huge &s;tone|lanthorn,
with great pillars of &s;tone about it, that
it may well be accounted the bolde&s;t piece of Archi|tecture
(as he &s;aith) that I think the world hath &s;een.
The Roof arched or vaulted, and the vault divided
into great &s;quares or panes like wain&s;cot after the
old <HI>Roman</HI> fa&s;hion; the ribs and tran&s;ver&s;e borders
which terminate tho&s;e &s;quares or pannels being chan|nelled

encompa&s;&s;ing a large <HI>area</HI> before the Church, con&s;ist|ing
of 4 rows of great &s;tone pillars &s;tanding &s;o thick
that they &s;how like a grove of great trees: The

by 24 &s;teps; not to mention the incru&s;tation of &s;ome
part of the walls with poli&s;hed marble; the excel|lent
&s;tatues, &s;tately Altars, rare pictures and other

and in all re&s;pects I will not &s;ay comparable to but
excelling the be&s;t in the world.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay at <HI>Rome</HI> we rode forth to &s;ee 1.
<HI>Fre&s;cati 12 Italian</HI> miles di&s;tant, anciently called
<HI>Tu&s;culum,</HI> where <HI>Cicero</HI> had a <HI>villa</HI> or Countrey|hou&s;e,
of which as yet they &s;hew &s;ome remains.
Heer are at pre&s;ent 3 noted ville, 1. That of the
<HI>Borghe&s;i</HI> with the palace called <HI>Mondragone,</HI> and two
others. 2. The <HI>Villa Aldobrandina</HI> or <HI>Belvedere</HI> be|longing
to Prince <HI>Pamphylio.</HI> 3. The <HI>Villa Ludovi&s;ia;</HI>
all of them for walks, groves, Labyrinths, gardens
and other ornaments not inferiour to the be&s;t about
<HI>Rome,</HI> and for ca&s;cates or falls of water, wetting
&s;ports and other ingenious water-works, beyond
them. What we took more e&s;pecial notice of, as ha|ving
not before &s;een, was the imitation of a tempe&s;t
or &s;torm of thunder and rain. This artificial thun|der
they call <HI>Girandola.</HI></P>
<P>2. <HI>Tivoli,</HI> anciently <HI>Tibur,</HI> 18 Italian miles off
<HI>Rome.</HI> Of this City <HI>Horace</HI> was much enamoured,
praying that it might be the &s;eat and retirement of
his old age. <HI>Tibur Argeo po&s;itum colono, Sit meae &s;edes
utinam &s;enectae, Sit modus la&s;&s;o maris &amp; viarum mili|tiaeque.</HI>
It &s;tands like <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> on the brow of a hill
and overlooks the Campagna of <HI>Rome.</HI> Heer are
&s;ome remains of ancient temples and other build|ings,
and a remarkable ca&s;cate of the river <HI>Aniene</HI>
or <HI>Teverone.</HI> The villa of <HI>E&s;te</HI> for gardens and or|chards,
walks and groves, the <HI>Girandola</HI> and other
<PB N="367" REF="196">
water works is nothing inferiour to tho&s;e at <HI>Fre&s;cati.</HI>
About 5 miles di&s;tant from <HI>Tivoli</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed over the
Sulphur-river, the water whereof is warm, of a
blewi&s;h colour and noi&s;om &s;mell, much like to that
of the Sulphur-well at <HI>Knareburgh</HI> in <HI>York&s;hire.</HI> It
encru&s;ts the channel it runs in with a whiti&s;h kind of
friable &s;tone, which in many places in the bottom
and &s;ides of the channel congeals in the figure of
confects or &s;ugar-plums which they call <HI>Confetti de
Tivoli.</HI> Of the&s;e you have boxes full to be &s;old at
<HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o exactly re&s;embling confects both for fi|gure
and colour that no man can di&s;tingui&s;h them;
but they are not naturally found &s;o figured, as they
would make &s;trangers believe, but artificially made
&s;o by ca&s;ting in moulds. About <HI>Fre&s;cati</HI> we found
great &s;tore of <HI>Styrax arbor</HI> growing wild in the hed|ges,
which we found no where el&s;e beyond the Seas.</P>
<P>The Campagna of <HI>Rome</HI> &s;eems to be good land,
but is e&s;teemed a very bad air and unhealthful Coun|trey
to live in, which is the rea&s;on it is &s;o de&s;olate
and thin of inhabitants.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgot one natural Phaenomenon we
ob&s;erved at <HI>Rome,</HI> which did a little &s;urpri&s;e us. In
&s;harp <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;ty weather in the middle of Winter, the
water which the &s;ervants brought up to wa&s;h with
in the morning was hot to that exce&s;s that we did
verily believe they had heated it over the fire; nor
could we be per&s;waded of the contrary till we went
down to the fountain, and found it there of equal
temper with what was brought up. It was formerly
taken for granted by the Peripatetic Schools, that
fountains of &s;pringing water are hotter in cold wea|ther
or winter and colder in hot or &s;ummer than at
other times; the rea&s;on whereof they a&s;&s;igned to be
an <HI>Antiperi&s;ta&s;is,</HI> &s;atisfying them&s;elves with that,
and &s;eeking no further. Later Philo&s;ophers who
could not content them&s;elves with the notion of <HI>An|tiperi&s;ta&s;is,</HI>
cho&s;e rather to deny the truth of the ex|periment,
<PB N="368" REF="197">
and affirmed that fountain-water was not
really warme&s;t in the colde&s;t weather, or colde&s;t in
the hotte&s;t, but only &s;eemed &s;o to our &s;ence; the
temper of which is much altered according to the
difference of the weather: So that what is much
colder than our temper in hot weather, is not much
colder in cold weather, and &s;o &s;eems not &s;o cold,
and on the contrary. Or thus, We judging of the
heat and cold of other things by the proportion they
bear to the temper of the air about us, when the air
is very cold, though the water hath the &s;ame degree
of cold it had before, yet it may be hotter then the
air, and con&s;equently &s;eem to us actually hot, and
<HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> But for my part whatever the rea&s;on be, I
mu&s;t needs a&s;&s;ert the truth of the experiment, being
very confident that the water, at lea&s;t of &s;ome &s;our|ces,
doth not only &s;eem to be but really is much hot|ter
in cold fro&s;ty weather than at other times; el&s;e
this water could not po&s;&s;ibly have &s;eemed to us, as
it did, more than luke-warm.</P>
<P>Great &s;tore of rain falls heer in winter time to
make amends for the extraordinary heat and
drought of the &s;ummer.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> is a place not only well worth the &s;eeing, but
very convenient to &s;ojourn in, there being where|withal
to entertain and divert men of all &s;orts of hu|mors
and tempers.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Romans</HI> &s;eemed to me in their hou&s;es
and furniture, particularly their beds and lodging,
in their diet, in their manners and cu&s;toms and in
their very pronunciation (&s;o liquid, plain and di|&s;tinct)
more to &s;ymbolize and agree with us <HI>English</HI>
then any other people of <HI>Italy,</HI> whether it were that
we learned of them or they of us or both mutually
of each other, when there was that great commerce
and entercour&s;e between us and that City for &s;o ma|ny
years together.</P>

on to the de&s;cription of our &s;ucceeding voyage.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> 24. 1664. We departed from <HI>Rome</HI> and
began our journey to <HI>Venice;</HI> riding along the <HI>Via
Flaminia,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Tiber</HI> again by the <HI>Ponte
Molle</HI> or <HI>Pons Milvius.</HI> At 7 miles di&s;tance from <HI>Rome</HI>
we pa&s;&s;ed a &s;mall village called <HI>Prima porta.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prima Parta.</NOTE> Some
&s;uppo&s;e that anciently the City extended thus far:
which conjecture I conceive is grounded upon the
name of this place. Eight miles further riding
brought us to a &s;mall town called <HI>Ca&s;tel novo,</HI> where
we lodged. All this afternoon we rode near the <HI>Ti|ber,</HI>
upon the <HI>Via Flaminia,</HI> which reaches as far as
<HI>Rimini.</HI> It is paved with broad flints, and pebbles,
and hath on each &s;ide a border of &s;tone, and in that
border at every &s;econd or third pace a &s;tone &s;tanding
up higher than the level of the border. We ob&s;er|ved
in the fields we pa&s;&s;ed through this day great
&s;tore of vernal <HI>crocu&s;es</HI> now in flower.</P>
<P>We proceeded on to <HI>Arignano</HI> or <HI>Ariano,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">25. Ariano.</NOTE> a little
town and a po&s;t-&s;tage 8 miles. Heer we left the <HI>Via
Flaminia,</HI> and rode round a high hill (which &s;tands
&s;ingle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civita Castella|na.</NOTE> and may be &s;een 20 miles forward) to <HI>Civita
Ca&s;tellana</HI> a little town &s;tanding on a hill and a po&s;t-&s;tage,
9 miles. Not far from hence we had the pro|&s;pect
of <HI>Caprarola</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI>'s Palace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Capraro|la.</NOTE>
[where we were told is a whi&s;pering room like that
in the Palace of <HI>Te</HI> at-<HI>Mantua]</HI> which &s;eemed not
to be more than two or three miles di&s;tant in a right
line, but we were a&s;&s;ured that as the way lay it was
ten or twelve miles thither.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="198">
Four miles further we came to a poor &s;mall town
called <HI>Borgetto;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Borghetto</NOTE> a little below which we pa&s;&s;ed the
<HI>Tiber</HI> by a bridge called <HI>Ponte Felice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ponte Felice.</NOTE> begun by <HI>Sixtus</HI>
V and fini&s;hed by <HI>Vrban</HI> VIII, for the benefit of
Travellers and Pilgrims, as appears by an in&s;cripti|on
upon it. Not far from the river on our right hand
we pa&s;&s;ed under a little town, &s;tanding on the top
of a hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maglia|no.</NOTE> called <HI>Magliano,</HI> and rode on about 6
miles near the bank of the river, (having in pro&s;pect
at a good di&s;tance on our left hand a town called
<HI>Horta)</HI> till we came to <HI>Vtricoli,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Horta.</NOTE> which town at pre|&s;ent
&s;tands upon a hill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vtricoli.</NOTE> but by the ruines that re|main,
the ancient <HI>Ocricoli</HI> &s;eems to have lain near
the river, at lea&s;t part of it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Vtricoli</HI> we had &s;tony way over the moun|tains
for five miles. For about a mile before we en|tred
<HI>Narni</HI> we rode upon the brink of a horrid pre|cipice
by the river <HI>Nera's</HI> &s;ide.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Narni.</NOTE> <HI>Narni</HI> anciently called
<HI>Nequinum,</HI> and afterwards <HI>Narnia</HI> from the river <HI>Nar</HI>
which runs beneath that &s;teep rocky mountain upon
the ridge whereof this City &s;tands, was formerly a
<HI>Roman</HI> colony and a place of &s;ome account, but is
now very mean, poor, and incon&s;iderable. <HI>Leander
Albertus</HI> &s;aith it was ruined and left almo&s;t quite de|&s;olate
by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Souldiers who were quartered
there in the time that the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> V be|&s;ieged
Pope <HI>Clement</HI> VII in the Ca&s;tle S. <HI>Angelo. Gatta|melata</HI>
the famous Captain for the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to
whom they have erected a bra&s;s &s;tatue on hor&s;eback
near S. <HI>Antonies</HI> Church in the City of <HI>Padua,</HI> was
native of this town. Near <HI>Narni</HI> are &s;een the re|mainders
of va&s;t arches of &s;tone, which &s;ome &s;ay
were of a bridge, others more probably of an Aque|duct,
over the river from one mountain to another.</P>
<P>We rode from <HI>Narni</HI> over a plea&s;ant and fruitful
valley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> encompa&s;&s;ed with mountains, and cultiva|ted
after the manner of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> to <HI>Terni,</HI> anciently
<HI>Interamna</HI> from its &s;ituation, a hand&s;ome little City,
<PB N="371" REF="198">
having a pretty piazza, on which &s;tands a Church
that &s;eems to have been an ancient temple. About 4
miles from this town is that famous Ca&s;cate or fall
of water from the lake <HI>di Pie di Luco.</HI> At the fur|ther
end of this valley beyond <HI>Terni</HI> and upon the
hills were the greate&s;t olive-yards or rather fore&s;ts of
huge olive-trees that I have any where &s;een in <HI>Italy,</HI>
and at this time of the year we found the people ve|ry
bu&s;ie in bru&s;hing down and gathering of olives.</P>
<P>From <HI>Terni</HI> we had mountainous way to a little
place called <HI>Tritura,</HI> another Po&s;t-&s;tage, and from
thence we de&s;cended to <HI>Spoleto,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spoleto.</NOTE> the chief town of
<HI>Vmbria</HI> thence called <HI>Ducato Spoletano.</HI> The walls
of this City are of a large extent, and the hou&s;es in|differently
fair, and there are to be &s;een many ruines
of ancient buildings in it.</P>
<P>From <HI>Spoleto</HI> we rode through a very plea&s;ant and
fruitfull valley of a great extent, &s;urrounded with
mountains, much re&s;embling the <HI>Arena</HI> of an Amphi|theater,
planted with rows of trees and vines after the
manner of <HI>Lombardy.</HI> The hills round about yield
a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect, being &s;prinkled every where
with little towns and hou&s;es &s;et thick upon them.
About 4 miles &s;hort of <HI>Foligno</HI> we rode under an

called <HI>Trevi.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Trevi.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Foligno [Fulginium]</HI> is a plea&s;ant and hand&s;ome

we ob&s;erved the like woods of olive-trees as in the
valley of <HI>Terni.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Foligno</HI> we a&s;cended again in a way cut
out of the &s;ide of a mountain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jan. 27.</NOTE> having on our left
hand a huge precipice, and below a valley between
very high and &s;teep hills, into which at the upper
end falls down a little river called <HI>Dale,</HI> which drives
&s;ome paper-mills; a plea&s;ant place to behold. About
4 or 5 miles from <HI>Foligno</HI> we got up to the top of the
<PB N="372" REF="199">
<HI>Apponnine,</HI> where the mountains all about us were co|vered
with &s;now. On the top of the&s;e mountains is
a little plain, and upon it a &s;mall lake or pool
of water, and a village called <HI>Col fiorito,</HI> a very
plea&s;ant place in Summer-time, as its name
imports. When we had pa&s;&s;ed over this plain we
began again to de&s;cend, and the next con&s;iderable
village we came to was <HI>Serravalle, ex re nomen habens,</HI>
it being &s;ituate in the jaws of a narrow valley, 14
miles di&s;tant from <HI>Foligno.</HI> From <HI>Serravalle</HI> we rode

<HEAD>The miraculous Origin and Tran&s;lation of the Church
of our Lady of Loretto.</HEAD>
<P>The Church of <HI>Loreto</HI> was a Chamber of the
B. Virgin nigh <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in which &s;he was born and
<PB N="374" REF="200">
bred, and &s;aluted by the Angel, and therein concei|ved
and brought up her Son <HI>Je&s;us</HI> to the age of 12
years. This chamber after the A&s;cen&s;ion of our Savi|our
was by the Apo&s;tles con&s;ecrated into a Church
in honour of the B. Lady: and S. <HI>Luke</HI> made a pi|cture
to her, likewi&s;e extant therein to be &s;een at
this very day. It was frequented with great devotion
by the people of the Countrey where it &s;tood whil&s;t
they were Catholics. But when leaving the Faith of
Chri&s;t they followed the Sect of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> the An|gels
took it and carried it into <HI>Sclavonia</HI> and placed
it by a town called <HI>Flumen,</HI> where not being had in
due reverence, they again tran&s;ported it over the
Sea to a wood in the territory of <HI>Recanati,</HI> belong|ing
to a Noble woman called <HI>Loretta,</HI> from whence
it took the name of our Lady of <HI>Loreto;</HI> and thence
again they carried it, by rea&s;on of the many robbe|ries
committed, to a mountain of two brothers in
the &s;aid territory: and from thence finally, in re|&s;pect
of their di&s;agreement about the gifts and offer|ings,
to the common high-way not far di&s;tant,
where it now remains without foundations, famous
for many &s;igns, graces and miracles; whereat the
inhabitants of <HI>Recanati,</HI> who often came to &s;ee it,
much wondering, environed it with a &s;trong and
and thick wall, yet could no man tell whence it
came originally, till in the year 1296. the B. V. ap|peared
in &s;leep to a holy devout man, to whom &s;he
revealed it, and he divulged it to others of Autho|rity
in this Province, who determining forthwith to
try the truth of the vi&s;ion, re&s;olved to chu&s;e xvi
men of credit, who to that effect &s;hould go all to|gether
to the City of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> as they did, carrying
with them the mea&s;ures of this Church, and com|paring
therewith the foundatious remnant, they
found them wholly agreeable; and in a wall there
by engraven, that it &s;tood there, and had left the
place. Which done they pre&s;ently returning back,
<PB N="375" REF="200">
publi&s;hed the premi&s;&s;es to be true: and from that
time forward it hath been certainly known, that this
Church was the Chamber of the Virgin <HI>Mary:</HI> to
which Chri&s;tians began then, and have ever &s;ince had
great: devotion, for that in it daily &s;he hath done and
doth many and many miracles. One <HI>Frere Paul de

went to Mattins, &s;aid that for ten years &s;pace on
the 8th. of <HI>September,</HI> two hours before day he &s;aw
a light de&s;cend from heaven upon it, which he &s;aid
was the B. V. who there &s;hewed her &s;elf on the Fea&s;t
of her Nativity. In confirmation of all which two
virtuous men of the city of <HI>Recanati</HI> divers times
declared unto the Prefect of <HI>Terreman</HI> and Gover|nour
of the forementioned Church is followeth,
The one called <HI>Paul Renalduci</HI> avouched, that his
Grandfather &s;aw when the Angels brought it over
the Sea, placed it in the forementioned wood, and
had often vi&s;ited it there: the other called <HI>Francis
Prior</HI> in like &s;ort affirmed, that his Grandfathers
Grandfather, being 120 years old, had al&s;o much
frequented it in the &s;ame place, and for further proof
that it had been there, he reported that his Grand|fathers
Grandfather had a hou&s;e nigh unto it, where|in

the Angels from thence to the mountain of the two
Brothers, where they placed it as above&s;aid.</P>

the reputation of &s;o great a Poet. This City may
boa&s;t of its antiquity and what it hath been, not
what it is, and yet the Cardinal Legate Governour
of <HI>Romandiola</HI> u&s;ually re&s;ides heer. It is very ill &s;er|ved
with fi&s;h, notwith&s;tanding it is &s;o near the Sea:
there's &s;carce a good Inn in Town, it lying out of the
way of travellers, and &s;trangers, and being no through|fare.
What was true of old is true &s;till heer; Its har|der
to get good water than good wine, <HI>Sit ci&s;ternae
mihi quam vinea malo Ravennae,</HI> the water being all
bracki&s;h: Neither yet was the wine we met withal
any of the be&s;t. I wonder this City &s;hould not be
more populous and rich; the Countrey on the
North&s;ide all along to <HI>Faenza,</HI> &s;eeming to be fat and
fertile land, and being planted after the manner of
<HI>Lombardy.</HI> It lies indeed very low, yet I believe
now adays is never overflown.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erved in this journey from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Venice</HI>
a great difference between the temperature of the
air on this &s;ide and on the other &s;ide the <HI>Appennine</HI>

mountains, on the other &s;ide it being very tempe|rate
and warm, but on this &s;ide as cold and raw as
it is at any time in winter with us, or indeed can
well be in open weather; and that this cold did not
proceed from a general change of weather &s;ince our
coming on this &s;ide we are well a&s;&s;ured; for we heard
of no &s;uch change, and we found &s;now lying heer in
the low grounds in many places, which on the other
&s;ide was all melted and gone even upon the hills be|fore
our coming over. The rea&s;on of this is obvious,
becau&s;e this ridge of hills being higher than the low|er
region of the air, or place where the Sun-beams
are reflected, hinders the commixture of the warm
Southerly and We&s;tern air with the cold Northerly
and Ea&s;tern, but e&s;pecially &s;topping on one hand
the South and We&s;t winds which el&s;e would drive
the temperate air and tepid vapours into the&s;e parts;
and on the other hand the cold Northern and Ea&s;tern
bla&s;ts, which el&s;e would temper and much abate the
warmth of tho&s;e beyond the mountains. Hence I do
not think incredible nor much wonder at what is
related by &s;ome Travellers of a mountain in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI>

<P>They are a &s;till, quiet people, as being naturally
melancholy; of a middle temper between the fa|&s;tuous
gravity of the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and unquiet levity of
the <HI>French,</HI> agreeing very well with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as

<P>They are very faithful and loving to their friends,
mindful of a courte&s;ie received, and if it lies in their
way or power for one good turn will do you two.
This I had from a very intelligent per&s;on who hath
lived and conver&s;ed long enough among them to
know them throughly. <HI>Barclay</HI> him&s;elf confe&s;&s;eth,
that where they do truly love <HI>omnia di&s;crimina ha|bent
infra tam humani foederis &s;anctitatem.</HI> Under&s;tand
it of the better &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t; for Shopkeepers and Trade&s;|men
are fal&s;e and fraudulent enough; and Inn-keep|ers,
Carriers, Watermen and Porters as in other pla|ces
horribly exacting if you make not an explicit
<PB N="393" REF="209">
bargain with them beforehand: in&s;omuch that in
many places the State hath thought it nece&s;&s;ary by
public <HI>Bando</HI> and decree to determine how much Inn-keepers
&s;hall receive of travellers for their dinner
and for their &s;upper and lodging.</P>
<P>They are not ea&s;ily provoked, but will bear long
with one another; and more with &s;trangers than
their own Countreymen. They are al&s;o very careful
to avoid all occa&s;ions of quarrel; not to &s;ay or do
any thing that may offend any per&s;on, e&s;pecially not
to abu&s;e any one by je&s;ting or drollery; which they
do not like nor can ea&s;ily bear.</P>
<P>No people in <HI>Europe</HI> are more &s;crupulous and ex|act
in ob&s;erving all the <HI>punctilio's</HI> of civility and good
breeding (<HI>bella creanza</HI> they call it) only methinks
the Epithets they be&s;tow upon mean per&s;ons are
&s;omewhat extravagant, not to &s;ay ridiculous, as
when they &s;tile a mechanic or common trade&s;man
<HI>Signor molto magnifico</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>When they are in company together they do not
only give every man his turn of &s;peaking, but al&s;o
attend till he hath done, accounting it a piece of
very ill breeding to interrupt any man in his di&s;|cour&s;e,
as hating to be interrupted them&s;elves. Con|trary
to the manner of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who
make no &s;cruple of interrupting one another, and
&s;ometimes talk all together. As careful are they, not
to whi&s;per privately one to another when in compa|ny,
or to talk in an unknown language which all the
company under&s;tands not. They do al&s;o &s;hew their
civility to &s;trangers in not &s;o much as asking them
what Religion they are of, avoiding all unnece&s;&s;ary
di&s;putes about that &s;ubject, which are apt to engen|der
quarrels: which thing we could not but take no|tice
of, becau&s;e in <HI>France</HI> you &s;hall &s;earce exchange
three words with any man, before he ask you that
que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It is not ea&s;ie for a &s;tranger to get acquaintance and
<PB N="394" REF="210">
familiarity with the <HI>Italians,</HI> they not much delight|ing
to conver&s;e with &s;trangers, as not knowing their
humours and cu&s;toms. Yet is their conver&s;ation when
gotten plea&s;ant and agreeable, their di&s;cour&s;e profit|able
and carriage obliging.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of them, even of the ordinary &s;ort of peo|ple,
will di&s;cour&s;e intelligently about Politic affairs
and the government and intere&s;t of their own Coun|trey;
being much addicted to and delighted in Po|litic
&s;tudies and di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of them are very covetous of liberty, e&s;pe|cially
&s;uch Cities as have been formerly Common-wealths,
di&s;cour&s;es or treati&s;es of that &s;ubject ma|king
deep impre&s;&s;ions on their minds: So that in
&s;ome places not only books but al&s;o di&s;cour&s;es about
former revolutions are prohibited. <HI>Barclay</HI> al&s;o &s;aith,
that they are <HI>glorio&s;ae libertatis cupidi, cujus adhuc
imaginem vident.</HI> Hence the Princes of <HI>Italy</HI> build
&s;tore of Ca&s;tles and cittadels in their territories, not
&s;o much to defend them&s;elves again&s;t their enemies
as to bridle their Subjects, and &s;ecure them&s;elves
again&s;t tumults and in&s;urrections. A &s;trange thing
it is, that of all the people of <HI>Italy</HI> the <HI>Neapolitans,</HI>
who never ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of liberty, nor men|ded
their condition by their commotions, but always
(as we &s;ay) <HI>leapt out of the frying-pan into the fire,</HI> &s;hould be the mo&s;t tumultuous and given to rebel
again&s;t their Princes. <HI>Leti</HI> tells us of one of tho&s;e
petty &s;ubordinate Princes in this Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI>
called <HI>Thoma&s;o Ferrari,</HI> who governed his &s;ubjects
not like va&s;&s;als, but with that &s;weetne&s;s and gen|tlene&s;s,
as if they had been his own children; yet
&s;ome of the&s;e fellows taking arms come into their
Princes pre&s;ence, and &s;ay to him, <HI>Sir Prince, we are
come to drive you out of your Palace and burn all your
moveables. Why</HI> (an&s;wers the Prince) <HI>can you find
fault with my government? Are you aggrieved in any
thing and it &s;hall be redre&s;&s;ed: No</HI> (replied they)
<PB N="395" REF="210">
<HI>but becau&s;e we under&s;tand that many of our Countrey|men
have revolted from their Lords, we al&s;o to &s;hew that
we love revolutions, are re&s;olved to rebel again&s;t you.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> are greatly delighted in Pictures,
&s;tatues and mu&s;ic from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t of
them, and &s;o intemperately fond of the&s;e things
that they will give any rate for a choice picture or
&s;tatue. Though all of them cannot paint or play on
the mu&s;ic, yet do they all affect skill and judgment
in both: And this knowledge is enough to deno|minate
a man a <HI>virtuo&s;o.</HI> Many of them are al&s;o cu|rious
in collecting ancient coyns and medals.</P>
<P>They are great admirers of their own language,
and &s;o wholly given to cultivate, poli&s;h and enrich
that, that they do in a great mea&s;ure neglect the <HI>La|tine,</HI>
few of them now adays &s;peaking or writing
well therein; but mingling &s;o many <HI>Italian</HI> idio|ti&s;ms
with it, that you have much ado to under&s;tand
what they &s;peak or write. As for the <HI>Greek,</HI> few or
none have any tolerable skill in it, the &s;tudy thereof
being generally neglected and laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>They are very temperate in their diet, eating a
great deal of &s;allet and but little fle&s;h. Their wine they
drink well diluted with water, and &s;eldom to any
exce&s;s. We &s;aw only one <HI>Italian</HI> drunk by the &s;pace
of a year and half that we &s;ojourned in <HI>Italy.</HI> Whe|ther
it be that in hot Countreys men have not &s;o
good &s;tomachs as in cold; or whether meat as be|ing
better concocted nouri&s;hes more there; or that
the <HI>Italians</HI> are out of principle, temper or cu&s;tom
more &s;ober and temperate than other nations. Their
herbs &s;eemed to me more &s;avory and better concocted
than ours. Their water al&s;o was not &s;o crude. But for
fle&s;h ours in my judgment much excels theirs, being
much more &s;ucculent and &s;apid. Yet in <HI>Rome</HI> have I
eaten beef not inferiour to ours: but I &s;uppo&s;e it might
be of <HI>German</HI> oxen; of which (as we were informed)
there are many driven thither: and for &s;ucking veal
<PB N="396" REF="211">
the <HI>Romans</HI> (as we have already noted) think theirs
preferrable to any in the world.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of inferiour quali|ty,
are in all things very &s;paring and frugal: Whe|ther
it be becau&s;e they are &s;o educated and accu&s;tom|ed,
or becau&s;e the gabels and taxes which they pay
to their governours are &s;o great that they cannot af|ford
to &s;pend much on them&s;elves; or becau&s;e na|turally
loving their ca&s;e they had rather live nearly
then take much pains.</P>
<P>The Nobility and great per&s;ons chu&s;e rather to
&s;pend their revenues in building fair palaces and
adorning them with Pictures and &s;tatues, in making
&s;tately and &s;pacious orachards, gardens and walks, in
keeping coaches and hor&s;es and a great retinue of
&s;ervants and &s;taffiers, than in keeping great hou&s;es
and plentiful tables; giving board-wages to their
&s;ervants and attendants, which in my opinion is the
better way of &s;pending e&s;tates, the&s;e things finding
poor people employment, &s;o that the money comes
to be di&s;tributed among them according to their in|du&s;try;
whereas the other way maintains in idle|ne&s;s
&s;uch per&s;ons for the mo&s;t part as lea&s;t de&s;erve
relief: tho&s;e that are mode&s;t and de&s;erving chu&s;ing
rather (if po&s;&s;ibly they can) to maintain them&s;elves
and their families by the labour of their hands, than
hang about great hou&s;es for a meals meat. Be&s;ides
that great hou&s;e-keeping is very often, not to &s;ay al|ways,
the occa&s;ion of great di&s;order and intempe|rance.
Were I therefore Gods &s;teward for a great
e&s;tate (for &s;uch all rich men are or ought to be) I
&s;hould think it more charity to employ poor people
and give them mony for their work, than to di&s;tri|bute
my e&s;tate among them freely and &s;uffer them to
live in idlene&s;s, I mean &s;uch as are able to labour.</P>
<P>The inferiour Gentry affect to appear in public
with as much &s;plendour as they can, and will deny
them&s;elves many &s;atisfactions at home that they may
<PB N="397" REF="211">
be able to keep a coach, and therein make the <HI>tour
&agrave; la mode</HI> about the &s;treets of their City every even|ing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> when they call, &s;peak to, or of one
another, u&s;e only the Chri&s;tian name, as <HI>Signor
Giacomo, Signor Giovanni,</HI> &amp;c. unle&s;s it be for di&s;tin|ctions
&s;ake, &s;o that you may conver&s;e among them
perchance &s;ome months before you hear any mans
&s;urname mentioned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italian</HI> Gentry live for the mo&s;t part in the
Cities, whence it is that the Cities are &s;o &s;plendid
and well built, &s;o populous and rich; and the
Countrey &s;o poor and thinly inhabited. Yet are the
Noblemens Palaces rather great and &s;tately, than
commodious for habitation. In many Cities the pa|per
windows (which are for the mo&s;t part tatter'd
and broken) di&s;grace the buildings, being un&s;uitable
to their magnificence.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are generally built of &s;tone, thick
walled and high rooft, which makes them warm in
Winter and cool in Summer: but they contrive
them rather for coolne&s;s than warmth, and therefore
make the windows large to give them air enough.</P>
<P>Of the Gentry in <HI>Italy,</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Venice,</HI> if
there be many brothers of one hou&s;e only one u&s;ual|ly
marries, and that the elde&s;t if he plea&s;es; if he
be not di&s;po&s;ed then any other, as they can agree
among them&s;elves. The re&s;t do what they can to
greaten him that is married, to uphold the Family.
The brothers that marry not keep concubines or
whores; which though it be &s;in, yet their Confe&s;|&s;ors
can ea&s;ily ab&s;olve them of it.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the Cities and Towns of <HI>Italy</HI> there
are <HI>Academies</HI> or Societies of <HI>Virtuo&s;i,</HI> who have at
&s;et times their meetings and exerci&s;es, which are
for the mo&s;t part prolu&s;ions of wit and <HI>Rhetoric,</HI> or
di&s;cour&s;es about moral &s;ubjects, curious que&s;tions
and Problems, or Paradoxes, &s;ometimes extempo|rany,
<PB N="398" REF="212">
&s;ometimes premeditated. The&s;e have their
head whom they call Prince, and a certain number
of Academi&s;ts, who are cho&s;en by balloting, but
they &s;eldom refu&s;e any that offer them&s;elves to ele|ction.
Many of the&s;e Academies a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves
conceited or fanciful names, and take a &s;ute|able
<HI>impre&s;e</HI> or coat of arms; as for example the
<HI>Academi&s;ts</HI> of <HI>Bergamo</HI> call them&s;elves <HI>Eccitati,</HI> and
their impre&s;e is the picture of the morning. In <HI>Man|tua</HI>
the Academi&s;ts called <HI>Acce&s;i</HI> have taken for their
Emblem a Looking-gla&s;s reflecting the Sun-beams;
tho&s;e called <HI>Timidi</HI> a hare. As for the other Cities
of <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Rome</HI> there are 3 <HI>Academies,</HI> the <HI>Hu|mori&s;ti,</HI>
the <HI>Lyncei</HI> and the <HI>Fanta&s;tici:</HI> in <HI>Padua 3,</HI>
the <HI>Ricoverati, Infiammati</HI> and <HI>Incogniti:</HI> in <HI>Bologna 3,
Ardenti, Indomiti,</HI> and one innominate: in <HI>Venice 2,

<P>Mo&s;t of the <HI>Italians</HI> of any fa&s;hion wear black or
dark coloured cloths, and for the fa&s;hion of them
follow the <HI>French</HI> (but not too ha&s;tily) excepting
tho&s;e Countries which are &s;ubject to the King of
<HI>Spain;</HI> which u&s;e the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> habit.</P>
<P>As for their vices, they are chiefly taxed for three.</P>
<P>1. <HI>Revenge;</HI> they thinking it an ignoble and un|manly
thing to put up or pa&s;s by any injury or af|front.
Many times al&s;o they di&s;&s;emble or conceal
their di&s;plea&s;ure and hatred under a pretence of
<PB N="399" REF="212">
friend&s;hip, that they may more ea&s;ily revenge them|&s;elves
of whom they hate by poi&s;oning, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating
or any other way; for nothing will &s;atisfie them
but the death of tho&s;e who have injured them: and
there be <HI>Bravo's</HI> and cut-throats ready to murther
any man for a &s;mall piece of mony. Be&s;ides, which
is wor&s;t of all, they are implacable, and by no means
to be tru&s;ted when they &s;ay they pardon. Hence they
have a Proverb among them, <HI>Amicitie reconciliate &amp;
mene&s;tre ri&s;caldate non furono mai grate.</HI> The women
al&s;o provoke their children to revenge the death of
their fathers by &s;hewing them the weapons where|with
they were murthered, or cloths dipt in their
blood or the like, by which means feuds between
families are maintained and entail'd from generati|on
to generation. The&s;e are the qualities for which
we u&s;ually &s;ay, An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man <HI>Italianate</HI> is a De|vil
incarnate.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Lu&s;t,</HI> to which the inhabitants of hot Coun|treys
are by the temper of their bodies inclined.
Hence it is that all Cities and great Towns do &s;o
&s;warm with Courtezans and Harlots; and to avoid
wor&s;e evils the State is nece&s;&s;itated to give them pub|lic
toleration and protection. As for ma&s;culine
venery and other works of darkne&s;s, I shall not charge
the <HI>Italians</HI> with them, as not having &s;ufficient
ground &s;o to do; and becau&s;e (as <HI>Barclay</HI> &s;aith) <HI>Haec
&s;celera tenebris damnata &amp; negari facili&ugrave;s &agrave; con&s;ciis
po&s;&s;unt, &amp; ab aemulis fingi.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>Jealou&s;ie,</HI> which &s;trangely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this peo|ple;
&s;o that for every little &s;u&s;picion they will &s;hut
up their wives in a chamber, and carry the key with
them, not &s;uffering them to &s;tir abroad unle&s;s them|&s;elves
accompany them. To &s;alute an <HI>Italians</HI> wife
with a ki&s;s is a &s;tabbing matter; and to call a man
<HI>cornuto</HI> or Cuckold in good earne&s;t is the greate&s;t af|front
or di&s;grace you can put upon him. The mar|ried
women in <HI>Italy</HI> by this means have but bad
<PB N="400" REF="213">
lives, being for the mo&s;t part confined to their hou|&s;es
except when they go to Church, and then they
have an old woman attending them: the doors of
their hou&s;es &s;hut up at dinner and &s;upper; all vi&s;its
and familiar di&s;cour&s;es with men denied them; nei|ther
can they &s;peak or &s;mile without &s;u&s;picion: one
rea&s;on of this among others may be, becau&s;e the
husbands knowing them&s;elves to be &s;o di&s;hone&s;t and
fal&s;e to their wives, they pre&s;ume that had they op|portunity
they would not be more true to them.
And yet for all this guarding and circum&s;pecti|on
are not the <HI>Italian</HI> Dames more uncorrupt than
the matrons of other Nations, but find means to de|ceive
their husbands, and be di&s;hone&s;t in &s;pight of
jealou&s;ie.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I might add <HI>Swearing,</HI> which is &s;o or|dinary
among all &s;orts, the Prie&s;ts and Monks them|&s;elves
&s;carce ab&s;taining from oaths, that I believe
they account it no &s;in.</P>
<P>It is a general cu&s;tom all over <HI>Italy</HI> to &s;leep an
hour or two after dinner in Summer time; &s;o that
from two of the clock till four in the afternoon you
&s;hall &s;carce &s;ee any body &s;tirring about the &s;treets of
the Cities. Indeed if one &s;its &s;till it is very hard to
keep his eyes open at that time. Either this cu&s;tom
did not prevail when the School of <HI>Salerno</HI> wrote
their Phy&s;ic precepts, or that direction, <HI>Sit brevis
ant nullus tibi &s;omnus meridianus,</HI> was calculated for
<HI>England,</HI> to who&s;e King that Book was dedicated.
And yet the <HI>Italian</HI> Phy&s;icians &s;till advi&s;e people ei|ther
not to &s;leep at all after dinner, or if they mu&s;t
&s;leep, to &s;trip off their cloths and go to bed, or on|ly
to take a nod in a chair &s;itting.</P>
<P>In many Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> are Ho&s;pitals where Pil|grims
and poor travellers are entertained, and have
their diet and lodging for three days (if they have
rea&s;on to &s;tay &s;o long) <HI>gratis,</HI> be&s;ides a piece of mo|ny
when they go away.</P>
<P><PB N="401" REF="213">
There are al&s;o Ho&s;pitals to receive expo&s;ed chil|dren,
if I may &s;o term them; that is, any without
exception that &s;hall be brought and put in at a grate
on purpo&s;e, whither upon ringing of a bell an Of|ficer
comes pre&s;ently and receives the child, and
asking the party that brought it, whether it hath
been baptized? carries it to a nur&s;e to give it &s;uck;
and there it is maintained till it be grown up. The
place where it is put in is &s;o &s;trait as to admit only
children new born or very young. This I look upon
as a good in&s;titution in great Cities, taking away
from women the temptation of murthering their
new-born children, or de&s;troying their conceptions
in the womb, to hide their &s;hame. I know what
may be objected again&s;t it, <HI>viz.</HI> that it emboldens
them to play the wantons, having &s;o fair a way of
concealing it: <HI>Sed ex malis minimum.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Rome, Venice</HI> and &s;ome other Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> they
have a way of exerci&s;ing charity little u&s;ed among
us. Several Confraternities of well-di&s;po&s;ed per|&s;ons
rai&s;e &s;ums of mony by a free contribution
among them&s;elves, which they be&s;tow yearly in
portions for the marrying of poor maids, which el&s;e
might want husbands, and be tempted to di&s;hone&s;t
practi&s;es to maintain them&s;elves. This I look upon
as well-plac'd alms and worthy the imitation; it be|ing
very convenient and in a manner nece&s;&s;ary, that
new-married people &s;hould have &s;omewhat to fur|ni&s;h
their hou&s;es and begin the world with; and no
le&s;s fitting, that young per&s;ons &s;hould be encouraged
to marry, as well for multiplying of people, where|in
the &s;trength of the Commonwealth chiefly con|&s;i&s;ts,
as for the preventing tho&s;e evils to which
young and &s;ingle per&s;ons are &s;trongly tempted and
inclined.</P>
<P>It is trouble&s;ome thing to travel with fire-arms
in <HI>Italy,</HI> you being forc'd in mo&s;t Cities to leave
them at the gate with the Guard, who give you a
<PB N="402" REF="214">
tally or token; and when you Leave the City you
bring your tally and receive your arms. This is done
to prevent a&s;&s;aults and murthers, which are &s;o fre|quent
in many Cities of <HI>Italy.</HI> For this the G. <HI>Duke</HI>
of <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> is much to be commended, there being
no &s;uch muthers and outrages committed in any
of the Cities under his dominion as in other places:
&s;o diliegent is he in &s;earching out, and &s;evere in pu|ni&s;hing
<HI>Bravo's,</HI> Cut-throats, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins and &s;uch kind
of malefactors. As much might be &s;aid for the <HI>Pope</HI>
in the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> but in other Cities in his Ter|ritories
there is killing enough.</P>
<P>When you depart from any City you mu&s;t be &s;ure
to take a <HI>bill</HI> of <HI>health</HI> out of the Office that is kept
every where for that purpo&s;e: without which you
can hardly get to be admitted into another City, e&s;|pecially
if it be in the Territory of another Prince
or State. If any one comes from an infected or &s;u&s;|pected
place he is forced to keep his <HI>Quarantain</HI> (as
they call it) that is, be &s;hut up in the <HI>Lazaretto</HI> or
Pe&s;t-hou&s;e 40 days before he be permitted to come
into the City. So &s;crupulou&s;ly careful are they to pre|vent
Contagion.</P>
<P>In <HI>Rome</HI> and other Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> we have often
ob&s;erved many labourers that wanted work &s;tanding
in the market places to be hired; whither people
that want help u&s;ually go and bargain with them.
Which cu&s;tom illu&s;trates that Parable of our <HI>Saviour</HI>
recorded in the beginning of the 20th. Chapter of
S. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s Go&s;pel, wherein the hou&s;holder is &s;aid
<HI>to go out about the third hour, and &s;ee others &s;tanding
in the market-place,</HI> ver. 3. and in <HI>ver.</HI> 6. he is &s;aid <HI>to
find others about the eleventh hour,</HI> and to &s;ay to them,
<HI>why &s;tand ye heer all the day idle;</HI> and <HI>ver. 7.</HI> they an|&s;wer,
<HI>becau&s;e no man hath hired us.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Italy</HI> and other hot Countreys &s;o &s;oon as they
have cut down their corn they thre&s;h and winnow
it u&s;ually, or at lea&s;t a great part of it, on a floor
<PB N="403" REF="214">
made in the open air, before they bring it into the
hou&s;e. Hence in the Scripture we read of thre&s;hing
floors as open places without roof or cover. Such I
&s;uppo&s;e was that where <HI>Boaz</HI> winnowed barley,
<HI>Ruth 3. 3.</HI> Neither is it any wonder that he &s;hould
lie there all night: for at <HI>Aleppo</HI> and even in <HI>Malta</HI>
in Summer time they &s;et their beds upon the roofs of
their hou&s;es, and &s;leep <HI>&s;ub Dio,</HI> in the open air.</P>
<P>One cu&s;tom we have in <HI>England,</HI> which (as far as
I could ob&s;erve) is no where u&s;ed beyond the Seas,
and that is for children to beg their Parents and
Godfathers ble&s;&s;ing upon the knee.</P>
<P>One cu&s;tom which prevails generally in foreign
Countreys is but little u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> that is to &s;a|lute
tho&s;e that &s;neez by vailing the bonnet, and pray|ing
God to ble&s;s, a&s;&s;i&s;t or defend them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There is a kind of &s;port or game much u&s;ed this
day by the <HI>Italians,</HI> called <HI>Gioco di mora,</HI> which
&s;eems to have been u&s;ed by the ancients and called
<HI>micare digitis.</HI> It is for the mo&s;t part between two,
who put out ju&s;t at the &s;ame time each of them as
many fingers as they plea&s;e and al&s;o name each of
them what number he thinks fit, and if either of
them happens to be the number of the fingers which
both of them together threw out, then he that names
that number wins one.</P>

<HEAD>Several &s;orts of Meats, Fruits, Sallets,
&amp;c. u&s;ed in Italy, and other Ob&s;ervati|ons
about Diet.</HEAD>
<P>1. IN <HI>Lombardy</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy, Tartufale</HI>
(as they call them) i. e. <HI>Tubera Terrae,</HI> a kind of
&s;ubterraneous Mu&s;hrome, which our Herbari&s;ts
<PB N="404" REF="215">
<HI>Engli&s;h Trubs,</HI> or after the <HI>French</HI> name <HI>Trufles,</HI> are
accounted a choice di&s;h, held by naturali&s;ts to be in|centive
of lu&s;t. The be&s;t of all are gotten in <HI>Sicily,</HI>
and thence &s;ent over into <HI>Malta,</HI> where they are &s;old
dear. The way to get them is to turn &s;wine into a
field where they grow, who find them by the &s;mell,
and root them up out of the ground, and &s;et one to
follow the &s;wine, and gather them up.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Snails</HI> boil'd and &s;erved up with oyl and pepper
put into their &s;hells are al&s;o accounted a good di&s;h: I
am &s;ure they are &s;old dear at <HI>Venice</HI> and el&s;ewhere, e&s;|pecially
the great whiti&s;h or a&s;h-coloured. &s;hell-&s;nails,
which we had not then &s;een in <HI>England,</HI> but have
&s;ince found plentifully upon the Downs near <HI>Darking</HI>
in <HI>Surrey,</HI> whither (as we were informed by the ho|nourable
<HI>Charles Howard</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>) they were brought
from beyond Seas by.
Mr. <HI>Martin Li&s;ter</HI> hath found them on the banks of
that hollow lane, leading from <HI>Puckeridge</HI> to <HI>Ware.</HI>
The&s;e &s;nails before winter &s;top up the mouth or
aperture of their &s;hells with a thick hard white pa&s;te
like a good lute or plai&s;ter, and are kept all Winter
in barrels or other ve&s;&s;els, and &s;old by the Poulter|ers.
The fir&s;t place where we met them to be &s;old in
the market was <HI>Vienna</HI> in <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> where they imi|tate
the <HI>Italians</HI> as well in their diet as in the manner
of their buildings.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Frogs</HI> are another <HI>Italian</HI> viand which we in
<HI>England</HI> eat not. The&s;e they u&s;ually fry and &s;erve up
with oil. At <HI>Venice</HI> they eat only the loins and hind|legs,
as al&s;o at <HI>Florence,</HI> and that upon fi&s;h-days. In
&s;ome places of <HI>Lombardy</HI> they eat their whole bo|dies,
and be&s;ides their frogs are of a larger &s;ize than
ordinary. Their fle&s;h &s;hews white and lovely as they
lie in the markets skin'd and ready prepared to be
fried. Howbeit even there in <HI>Italy, Kircher</HI> in his
book <HI>de Pe&s;te</HI> condemns them as an ambiguous and
dangerous meat, and I think de&s;ervedly; wherefore
<PB N="405" REF="215">
we do well having plenty of better food, wholly to
ab&s;tain from them.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Land Tortoi&s;es</HI> are accounted with them a better
meat than Sea-tortoi&s;es, and are commonly to be
&s;old in the markets. They are eaten by tho&s;e Orders
of Freres who&s;e rule obliges them to ab&s;tain from
fle&s;h, as <HI>Carthu&s;ians, Carmelites,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>5. They eat al&s;o many &s;orts of <HI>Shell-fi&s;h,</HI> which
we either have not or meddle not with, as Purples,
Periwinkles of &s;everal &s;orts, <HI>Patellae</HI> or Limpets,
Sea-urchins, which la&s;t are to be found every day in
the markets at <HI>Naples.</HI> They al&s;o eat the Sea-tortoi|&s;es,
of which the blood put into the &s;tomach and
boil'd is the be&s;t part.</P>
<P>6. <HI>Pa&s;te</HI> made into &s;trings like pack-thread or
thongs of whit-leather (which if greater they call
<HI>Macaroni,</HI> if le&s;&s;er <HI>Vermicelli</HI>) they cut in pieces and
put in their pots as we do oat-meal to make their
<HI>mene&s;tra</HI> or broth of, much e&s;teemed by the common|people.
The&s;e boil'd and oil'd with a little chee&s;e
&s;craped upon them they eat as we do buttered wheat
or rice. The making of the&s;e is a trade and my&s;tery;
and in every great town you &s;hall &s;ee &s;everal &s;hops of
them.</P>
<P>7. They &s;crape or grate <HI>Chee&s;e</HI> upon all their
di&s;hes even of fle&s;h; accounting that it gives the
meat a good relli&s;h; which to tho&s;e that are unaccu|&s;tomed
makes it rather nau&s;eous or loath&s;ome.</P>
<P>8. <HI>Che&s;nuts</HI> roa&s;ted and the kernels &s;erved up
with juyce of Lemon and &s;ugar are much e&s;teemed,
and by &s;ome called the <HI>Pi&s;tachios</HI> of <HI>Italy.</HI> At <HI>Bono|nia</HI>
they grind them and make little cakes of the
flower of them, which though eaten by the poor
are no de&s;irable dainty to a delicate palate. Roa&s;ted
Che&s;nuts are a great part of the diet of the poor Pe|&s;ants
in <HI>Italy;</HI> as we have el&s;ewhere noted.</P>
<P>9. They eat all manner of <HI>&s;mall birds</HI> as well as
the <HI>Germans,</HI> viz. <HI>Wrens, Stares, Titmi&s;e, Butcher-birds,</HI>
<PB N="406" REF="216">
&amp;c. and &s;everal great ones which we touch
not in <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Mag-pies, Jayes, Wood-peckers,
Jack-daws,</HI> &amp;c. nay we have frequently &s;een <HI>Kites</HI>
and <HI>Hawks</HI> lying on the Peulterers &s;talls; as we have
already noted in our de&s;cription of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>10. They u&s;e &s;everal herbs for <HI>Sallets,</HI> which are
not yet, or have been but lately u&s;ed in <HI>England:
v. g. Selleri,</HI> which is nothing el&s;e but &s;weet &s;mal|lage,
the young &s;hoots whereof with a little of the
head of the root cut off, they eat raw with oyl and
pepper: In like manner they eat Fennel: Artichoke
al&s;o they eat raw with the &s;ame &s;auce; [the &s;ame
part of it that is eaten boild.] In <HI>Sicily</HI> at the high|e&s;t
village upon that &s;ide Mount <HI>Aetna</HI> that we a&s;|cended,
they gave us to eat for a Sallet the &s;talks of
a tall prickly thi&s;tle, bearing a yellow flower, I &s;up|po&s;e
it was the <HI>Carduus Chry&s;anthemus</HI> Dod. which
the rankne&s;s of the &s;oil had cau&s;ed to mount up to
that &s;tature. Be&s;ides in mo&s;t of their &s;allets they
mingle Rocket, (<HI>Rachetta</HI> they call it) which to me
gives them an odious ta&s;te. <HI>Curl'd Endive</HI> blancht is
much u&s;ed beyond Seas; and for a raw &s;allet &s;eemed
to excel Lettuce it &s;elf: Be&s;ides it hath this advan|tage
that it may be kept all Winter.</P>
<P>11. Many <HI>fruits</HI> they eat which we either have not
or eat not in <HI>England,</HI> v. g. <HI>Jujubes,</HI> &s;old by the
Huck&s;ters while they are yet green: <HI>L'azarole,</HI> the
fruit of the <HI>Me&s;pilus Aronia,</HI> of a plea&s;ant acid ta&s;te:
both fruit and tree exactly like the common Haw|thorn,
but bigger. <HI>Services</HI> or <HI>Sorbes</HI> the true, as
big as little Pears; tho&s;e that grow with us are the
fruit of the <HI>Sorbus torminalis: Green figs</HI> both white
and blew in great plenty; a mo&s;t delicate fruit when
fully ripe, comparable for the ta&s;te to the be&s;t mar|malade,
and which may be eaten freely without
danger of &s;urfeiting: The husks or cods of <HI>Carobs,</HI>
called in <HI>Latine Siliqua dulcis,</HI> in <HI>Greek</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">, the
word u&s;ed <HI>Luke</HI> 15. 16. and therefore by &s;ome &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="407" REF="216">
to be the husks the Prodigal is &s;aid to have de|&s;ired
to fill his belly with. Indeed we thought
them fitter meat from &s;wine than men; for though
they had a &s;weet ta&s;te, yet afterwards they troubled
our &s;tomachs and purged us: but they have not up|on
all men the like effect; for the <HI>Italians</HI> and <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
eat them ordinarily without any &s;uch trou|ble:
<HI>Love-apples: Mad-apples</HI> both raw and pick|led:
<HI>Water-melons;</HI> which they u&s;e to eat to cool
and refre&s;h them, and &s;ome Phy&s;icians allow &s;ick
per&s;ons to eat them in Feavers. They are almo&s;t as
as big as Pompions, have a green rind and a reddi&s;h
pulp with blacki&s;h &s;eed when ripe. The <HI>Italians</HI> call
the&s;e <HI>Cucumeri,</HI> whereas Cucumers they call <HI>Citrulli.</HI>
Several &s;orts of Gourds, as <HI>Cucurbita lagenaria,</HI> and
<HI>Cucurbita flexuo&s;a&s;ive anguina;</HI> which eats very well
boild in pottage: <HI>Cucumis anguinus,</HI> which is more
e&s;teemed and indeed better ta&s;ted then the Cucum|ber.
The common people both in <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI>
eat green Chich-pea&s;e raw, as our people do com|mon
pea&s;e.</P>
<P>12. In their De&s;&s;erts and &s;econd cour&s;es they com|monly
&s;erve up pine-kernels, and in time of year
green Almonds: al&s;o a kind of &s;weet-meat or Con|fection
made up of mu&s;tard and &s;ugar, which they
call <HI>Italian</HI> mu&s;tard.</P>
<P>13. To cool and refre&s;h their wines they u&s;e ge|nerally
&s;now, where it may ea&s;ily be had, el&s;e ice,
which they keep in con&s;ervatories all Summer. With|out
&s;now they that are u&s;ed to it do not willingly
drink, no not in winter.</P>
<P>14. In the Kingdoms of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily</HI> they
make a &s;ort of chee&s;e which they call <HI>Ca&s;eo di cavallo,</HI>
i. e. Hor&s;e-chee&s;e, for what rea&s;on I could not learn.
The&s;e chee&s;es they make up in &s;everal forms; &s;ome
in the fa&s;hion of a blown bladder, &s;ome in the fa|&s;hion
of a cylinder and &s;ome in other figures. They
are neither fat nor &s;trong, yet well-ta&s;ted and accep|able
<PB N="408" REF="217">
to &s;uch as have eaten of them a while. The pulp
or body of them lies in flakes and hath as it were a
grain one way like wood. They told us that they
were made of Buffles milk, but we believed them
not, becau&s;e we ob&s;erved not many Buffles in tho&s;e
Countries, where there is more of this chee&s;e made
than of other &s;orts.</P>
<P>15. In <HI>Italy</HI> and other hot Countries their meat
is not only naturally more lean and dry then ours,
but they roa&s;t it al&s;o till it be ready to fall from the
bones, and there be little juyce left in it. Be&s;ides
when they roa&s;t their meat they draw coals under the
&s;pit, and let the fat drop on them, the <HI>nidor</HI> where|of
perfumes the meat, but not our gu&s;t who are
not u&s;ed to it, and what they lo&s;e in dripping they
&s;ave in fewel. Their roa&s;ting differs not much from
our broiling or carbonadoing. I &s;peak this of or|dinary
Inns and mean peoples hou&s;es, in great hou&s;es
and Inns it is otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Italians</HI> count not their hours as we do, from
twelve to twelve, beginning at midday and mid|night;
but from one to four and twenty, beginning
their count at Sun-&s;et, which is a much more trouble|&s;ome
way; the &s;etting of the Sun being a moveable
point or term, and they being therefore nece&s;&s;itated
to alter and new-&s;et their clocks every day: whereas
midday and midnight being fixt points, the clocks
need no &s;etting anew. As for <HI>Italy</HI> in general,
though the <HI>Italians</HI> imagine it to be the be&s;t Coun|trey
in the world, and have a Proverb among them
that <HI>Italy is the garden of the world:</HI> yet &s;etting
a&s;ide <HI>Lombardy, Campania</HI> and &s;ome few other
places, the re&s;t is mountainous and barren enough:
the earth &s;o parcht by the Sun-beams that it bears no
gra&s;s, and (as <HI>Barclay</HI> faith) &s;eldom yieldeth grain
enough for three year &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to &s;upply the ne|ce&s;&s;ities
and u&s;es of its inhabitants, whatever they
may boa&s;t of the <HI>Itala gleba.</HI> The rea&s;on why the
<PB N="409" REF="217">
<HI>Italians</HI> are &s;o conceited of their own Countrey is,
becau&s;e they &s;eldom travel abroad, and &s;o &s;ee not
the beauty and fertility of others.</P>
<P>I might have taken notice of the va&s;t and incredi|ble
number of Religious hou&s;es there are in <HI>Italy.</HI> I
have &s;ometimes thought they might in all of both
&s;exes amount to eight or ten thou&s;and. Of the&s;e the
Gentlemen make advantage. For &s;uch of their daugh|ters
as either they cannot get husbands for, or are
not able to give portions to, &s;uitable to their birth
and quality, they can in one of the&s;e hou&s;es for a &s;mal
matter honourably di&s;po&s;e of and &s;ettle for their
lives. The in&s;titution of &s;uch hou&s;es as the&s;e, whi|ther
young women of quality, who for want of
&s;ufficient fortunes or per&s;onal endowments cannot
ea&s;ily provide them&s;elves &s;uteable matches, might
retire and find honourable provi&s;ion, might per|chance
be tolerable, yea commendable, were they
purged from all &s;uper&s;tition the women not admit|ted
too young, and under no vow of perpetual cha|&s;tity,
only to leave the hou&s;e in ca&s;e they married.
But becau&s;e of the danger of introducing Monkery,
I think it more &s;afe for a Chri&s;tian State not to per|mit
any &s;uch foundations.</P>
<P>Bu&s;&s;les are a common bea&s;t in <HI>Italy,</HI> and they make
u&s;e of them to draw their wains as we do of oxen:
only becau&s;e they are &s;omewhat fierce and un|ruly,
they are forced to lead them by an iron-ring
put in their no&s;es, as our Bear-wards do their Bears.</P>
<P>For in&s;ects the mo&s;t remarkable &s;orts which we
want in <HI>England,</HI> are,</P>
<P>1. The <HI>Cicadae</HI> before mentioned.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>flying Glow-worms,</HI> which are there
every where to be &s;een in Summer time. The&s;e fly|ing
or winged Glow-worms are nothing el&s;e but the
males of the common creeping or unwinged Glow-worm
<HI>Fabius Columna</HI> relates, that <HI>Carolus Vinti|miglia</HI>
of <HI>Palermo</HI> in <HI>Sicily</HI> having out of curio&s;ity
<PB N="410" REF="218">
kept many unwinged Glow-worms in a gla&s;s did
put in among them a flying one, which pre&s;ently in
his &s;ight did couple with them one by one after the
manner of &s;ilk-worms; and that the next day the
unwinged ones or females began to lay their eggs.
That the males are al&s;o flying in&s;ects in <HI>England,</HI>
though they do but rarely or not at all &s;hine with us,
we are a&s;&s;ured by an eye-witne&s;s, who &s;aw them in
conjunction with the common &s;hining unwinged
Glow-worms. Heer by the way it may not be ami&s;s
to impart to the Reader a di&s;covery made by a cer|tain
Gentleman and communicated to me by <HI>Francis
Je&s;&s;op</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which is, that tho&s;e reputed Meteors
called in Latine <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> and known in <HI>England</HI>
by the conceited names of <HI>Jack with a Lanthorn,</HI> and
<HI>Will with a Wi&s;p,</HI> are nothing el&s;e but &s;warms of
the&s;e flying Glow-worms. Which if true, we may
give an ea&s;ie account of tho&s;e &s;trange <HI>phaenomena</HI> of
the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed fires, <HI>viz.</HI> their &s;uddain motion from
place to place and leading travellers that follow them
into bogs and precipices.</P>
<P>3. <HI>Scorpions,</HI> which in <HI>Italy</HI> &s;ting not, or at lea&s;t
their &s;tings are not veneno&s;e, as the learned <HI>Franci&s;cus
Redi</HI> affirms; though by experience he found
the &s;tinging of the <HI>African</HI> Scorpions to be mortal,
or at lea&s;t very noxious.</P>
<P>4. <HI>Tarantula's</HI> &s;o called becau&s;e found about <HI>Ta|rentum,</HI>
(though we have &s;een of them at <HI>Rome</HI>)
which are nothing el&s;e but a large &s;ort of Spiders;
the biting whereof is e&s;teemed venemous, and
thought to put people into Phrenetic fits, enforcing
them to dance to certain tunes of the Mu&s;ic, by
which means they are cured, long and violent exer|ci&s;e
cau&s;ing a great evacution by &s;weat. The&s;e fits
they &s;ay do al&s;o yearly return at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on the
Patient was bitten. But Dr. <HI>Thomas Cornelius</HI> of <HI>Co|&s;enza</HI>
before mentioned, a learned Phy&s;ician and
Virtuo&s;o in <HI>Naples,</HI> diligently enquiring into this ge|nerally
<PB N="411" REF="218">
received and heertofore unque&s;tioned &s;tory,
that he might &s;atisfie him&s;elf and others whether it
were really true in experience.</P>
<P>5. <HI>Cimiei</HI> as the <HI>Italians</HI> call them, as the <HI>French
Punai&s;e.</HI> We <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> them Chinches or Wall-lice,
which are very noi&s;ome and trouble&s;ome by their
bitings in the night time, rai&s;ing a great heat and
redne&s;s in the skin. They harbour in the &s;traw of
the bol&s;ters and mattre&s;&s;es and in the wood of the
bed&s;teds, and therefore in &s;ome <HI>No&s;ocomia</HI>
or Ho&s;pi|tals
for &s;ick per&s;ons, as for example at <HI>Genua,</HI> the
bed&s;teds are all of iron. This in&s;ect if it be cru&s;hed
or brui&s;ed emits a mo&s;t horrid and loath&s;ome &s;cent,
&s;o that tho&s;e that are bitten by them are often in a
doubt whether it be better to endure the trouble of
their bitings, or kill them and &s;uffer their mo&s;t odi|ous
and abminable &s;tink. We have of the&s;e in&s;ects
in &s;ome places of <HI>England,</HI> but not many, neither
are they trouble&s;ome to us.</P>

&s;peak both <HI>Italian</HI> and <HI>Dutch:</HI> &s;o that after we had
lo&s;t <HI>Italian</HI> in the valleys we wondered to find it
heer again among the hills. Their wines they bring
all out of the <HI>Valtelline,</HI> from <HI>Tirano,</HI> about 2 days

Bears there are and Wolves among the high

ruffs and long bu&s;hy beards. All the people (as far as
we had experience or could judge of them in the

hearty and civil, and the common &s;ort very

with &s;hingles of wood, the walls thick and the
windows very &s;mall to fence again&s;t the cold. They
have no &s;trong holds or fortified places among them;
nor will they permit any to be erected; having &s;o
much confidence in their own valour, that they

<HEAD>OF THE
GRISONS.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> are divided into 3 Leagues, and each
League &s;ubdivided into <HI>Communes:</HI> each <HI>com|mune</HI>
contains &s;everal Villages; not all an equal
number, but &s;ome more &s;ome fewer. The <HI>Lega
Gri&s;a</HI> (according to <HI>Simler</HI>) hath <HI>19 Communes.</HI> The
<HI>Lega della ca&s;a Dio</HI> hath 21 <HI>Communes,</HI> which are
&s;ometimes contracted into 11. <HI>Cleurn, Tavers</HI> and
<HI>Maltz</HI> have &s;ately revolted from this League, and
put them&s;elves under the Archduke of <HI>In&s;pruck.</HI> The
<HI>Dieci Dritture</HI> have ten, as the name imports. Each
<HI>Commune</HI> hath its annual chief Magi&s;trate, whom
in &s;ome places they call <HI>Mae&s;trale,</HI> and a certain num|ber
of A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors or Judges, which in their language
are called <HI>Truoeder.</HI> Each <HI>terra</HI> or Village chu&s;es its
Judges by majority of votes. [Sometimes the Peo|ple
chu&s;e only a certain number of Delegates, which
Delegates are to make choice of the Judges.] All
the People, as well rich as poor, as well Servants as
Ma&s;ters, have their Suffrages &s;o &s;oon as they come
to the age of 16 years. The time of their Election
is <HI>St. Matthias</HI> day. The <HI>Commune</HI> of <HI>Engadina alta</HI>
hath 10 great Villages (<HI>terre</HI> they call them) 16
Judges called <HI>Truoeder,</HI> one <HI>Mae&s;trale,</HI> one Chancel|lour
or Notary. The <HI>Mae&s;trale,</HI> the Chancellour, and
4 <HI>Truoeder</HI> are always of <HI>Zuotz.</HI> The other <HI>terre</HI> have
&s;ome one, &s;ome two, according to their bigne&s;s.
[In other Communities the &s;everal <HI>terre</HI> have the
<HI>Mae&s;trale</HI> and other Officers by turns.] The&s;e Ma|gi&s;trates
are changed every two years, but confirm|ed
every year, and may be put out by the People if
<PB N="415" REF="220">
they plea&s;e. The <HI>Mae&s;trale</HI> (called in &s;ome places
<HI>Landamman</HI>) is the chief, and a&s;&s;embles the <HI>Truoeder</HI>
together, makes Proce&s;&s;es, and in &s;um hath the
executive power. When they have occa&s;ion to meet
to decide any bu&s;ine&s;s, or judge in any criminal
cau&s;e, he that is ca&s;t or condemned, if he hath goods
bears the charges, if he hath none then the <HI>Com|mune</HI>
bears the charges; So that every <HI>Commune</HI> is a
Common-wealth by its &s;elf, and its government
purely Democratical. Every two years they have
two Diets or general Councils: The fir&s;t Diet
(when the Officers which they &s;end to their &s;eve|ral
<HI>Praefecturae</HI> are elected) is at <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> the &s;e|cond
(when they take an account of their Officers)
is on <HI>St. John Bapti&s;ts</HI> day. To the&s;e Diets each
<HI>Commune</HI> &s;ends its Delegates, <HI>Me&s;&s;i</HI> they call them,
or Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ome one and &s;ome two. The&s;e
Delegates mu&s;t act according to the in&s;tructions gi|ven
them by their &s;everal Communities. Each
League hate its Head or Chief. The Burgoma&s;ter of
<HI>Coira</HI> is always Head of the League <HI>della ca&s;a di Dio.</HI>
In the <HI>Lega Gri&s;a</HI> there are four Communities that
by ancient cu&s;tom have the Head (who is here cal|led
<HI>Landtreichter</HI>) by turns. In the <HI>Dieci Dritture</HI>
&s;ix Communities have the choice of the Chief, who
is called <HI>Landamman.</HI> Tho&s;e &s;ix <HI>Communes</HI> &s;end
each its Delegate to <HI>Tavas,</HI> and the Delegates by the
major vote chu&s;e the new <HI>Landamman.</HI> The&s;e &s;ome|times
with &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tants meet as a le&s;&s;er Council,
but have no ab&s;olute or deci&s;ive &s;entence. There
lies an Appeal from the general Diet to the Com|munities,
and what the major part of tho&s;e con|cludes
or agrees upon is valid. The <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> pay no
&s;ort of Datii, Gabels or Taxes. In <HI>Italy</HI> the Coun|ty
of <HI>Chiavenna</HI> and the <HI>Valtelline</HI> are &s;ubject to the
<HI>Gri&s;ons.</HI> To the County of <HI>Chiavena</HI> they &s;ent for|merly
two Pode&s;ta's or Bailifls, one to <HI>Plurs,</HI> which
Town was mi&s;erably de&s;troyed by the falling of a
<PB N="416" REF="221">

<HI>Commi&s;&s;ario.</HI> Near <HI>Plurs</HI> are made Pots and Ve&s;|of &s;tone turned after the manner of wood, which
will endure the fire. The <HI>Valtelline</HI> according to
<HI>Simler</HI> is divided into &s;ix <HI>Praefecturae,</HI> whether the
<HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> &s;end <HI>Pode&s;ta's</HI> or Governors. Tho&s;e are <HI>Bor|mio,</HI>
which &s;ome make a County by it &s;elf, <HI>Tirano,
Tellio, Sondrio, Morbegno</HI> and <HI>Travona.</HI> They named
to us two more, <HI>viz. Ponte</HI> and <HI>Chiur.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Pode|&s;ta's</HI>
are changed every two years, the principal or
head of them is the Prefect of <HI>Sondrio,</HI> who is not
called <HI>Pode&s;ta,</HI> but <HI>Governatore</HI> as we were told, as
<HI>Simler</HI> &s;aith <HI>Capitaneo.</HI> In the chu&s;ing of Praefects
the order both of the Leagues and of the Commu|nities
is ob&s;erved. So that for example, if the <HI>Lega
Gri&s;a</HI> chu&s;es the Governor of <HI>Sondrio</HI> for this two
years, the <HI>Lega della ca&s;a di Dio</HI> &s;hall have the choice
of him the next two, and the <HI>Dieci Dritture</HI> the
following. The like order is ob&s;erved in the &s;eve|ral
Communities of each League. The People of
<HI>Valtelline,</HI> the Country of <HI>Bormio,</HI> and the County of
<HI>Chiavenna</HI> pay no Taxes or Gabels more than for
the maintenance of their Governors or <HI>Pode&s;ta's.</HI></P>
<P>We left <HI>Ponte,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar. 24.</NOTE> and pa&s;&s;ed over another high

were almo&s;t up to the belly in &s;now: be&s;ides a
brisk gale of mo&s;t bitter cutting wind blew ju&s;t in
our faces, which did &s;o affect my eyes that I could
not open tem without great pain for three days,
nor ea&s;ily endure to look upon &s;now for a great
while after. The rea&s;on why my eyes were more
affected than others I conceive was, becau&s;e I was
not careful to wipe the &s;now off my face, but &s;uffer|ed
it to freez to the hair of my eyebrows and eye|lids:
<PB N="417" REF="221">
the cold whereof being contiguous to them,
&s;tupified, and would in time have quite mortified
my eyes. And here by the way we may take notice,
that the People living in this mountainous cold
Country look more &s;warthy and dusky, at lea&s;t their
their faces and parts expo&s;ed to the air, and have
not &s;o good complexions as tho&s;e that live below

<HI>Landamman</HI> is a Prote&s;tant, and the <HI>Statthalter</HI> a Papi&s;t; then the two following the <HI>Landamman</HI> is
a Papi&s;t and the <HI>Statthalter</HI> a Prote&s;tant. 3. The

The <HI>Landamman</HI> when his office is expired is called
old <HI>Landamman,</HI> and may &s;till &s;it in council, which
is a favour allowed him in regard of his former
dignity. The aforementioned Officers do al&s;o &s;it in
council. The <HI>Landamman</HI> puts men in pri&s;on by his
Authority, propounds bu&s;ine&s;s to the Council, ap|points
the days of the Councils meeting, and to that
end appoints the Officer to give them notice in the
Church. In this Canton, to avoid the ambition and
inordinate expences of Candidates for Offices, who
were wont to court and fea&s;t the people, they have
lately introduced Lottery in the choice of Officers
and Governours. All the Candidates are fir&s;t put to
the vote, and tho&s;e eight (if there be &s;o many for
any one place) who have mo&s;t &s;urages are &s;et in the
middle. Then the <HI>Landt&s;chrieb</HI> or Secretary takes
eight balls, one of which is gilt, and wraps them
up in &s;ingle papers, and puts them into a hat which
he holds under his arm, whil&s;t a little child puts in
his hand and takes out the balls one by one, and
gives them to the eight. He who happens to have
the gilt ball is the Officer. Be&s;ides the&s;e Councils
there are al&s;o two Con&s;i&s;tories of Judges; one con|&s;i&s;ting
of nine, cho&s;en by the <HI>Landtskmein</HI> out of the

<P>The&s;e three Cantons, <HI>Vti, Switz,</HI> and <HI>Vnderwald,</HI>
con&s;i&s;t chiefly, not to &s;ay wholly, of pa&s;ture ground:
No cornfields or vineyards heer. Their wine is
imported from <HI>Italy,</HI> their corn from &s;everal parts.
They boa&s;t that by this means their ground is not
&s;o &s;ubject to the ca&s;ualties of weather, or injuries of
bad &s;ea&s;ons as either plowed fields or vineyards,
and yields to the owners a more certain profit.
It's well if one rea&s;on why they maintain all their
ground pa&s;ture, be not becau&s;e they are unwilling to
take pains in husbandry. Wine is dear heer. At
<HI>Altorf</HI> and <HI>Stantz</HI> they have it from <HI>Logarno.</HI> At
<HI>Switz</HI> they have both <HI>Valtelline</HI> and <HI>Logarno</HI>-wine.
The people are very hone&s;t and good natured, keep
their hou&s;es neat and cleanly, and withal very po|lite
and in good repair. The men are given much to
drinking. The meat &s;tands before them three or
four hours, and they now and then cat a bit, but
the main bu&s;ine&s;s is drinking.</P>
<P>We travelled to <HI>Lucern,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">April. 5. Lucern.</NOTE> cro&s;&s;ing over a part of the
lake. This is a very neat city and plea&s;antly &s;ituate
upon the lake: divided into parts by a river which
runs out of the lake; over which there are three
bridges, one for carts and hor&s;es, the other two
hand&s;ome foot bridges covered over with a roof or
penthou&s;e, one near a quarter of a mile long. Be|&s;ides
there is a fourth bridge which leads towards
<PB N="428" REF="227">
the Church covered like this la&s;t, and longer than it.
The great Church &s;tands without the city wall,
a very hand&s;ome tall, and light&s;ome &s;tructure. O|ver
the We&s;tern door is the greate&s;t Organ that ever
I &s;aw: A man might very well creep into the hol|low
of the greater pipes of it. The account of the
Government that was given us heer was much dif|ferent
from <HI>Simlers.</HI> They told us that the Great
Council con&s;i&s;ted of 136, whereas he writes that it
con&s;i&s;ts of no more that 100: but the&s;e may be re|conciled;
for that, I &s;uppo&s;e, he excludes the le&s;&s;er
Council, which they included. They continue in
office during life; and when one dies, the re&s;t of
the Council chu&s;e another into his place, out of the
Citizens whom they think fit. <HI>Simler</HI> &s;aith that the
le&s;&s;er Council of the la&s;t half year chu&s;e the new
Senators. This Council hath two Pre&s;idents whom
they call <HI>Sculteti,</HI> who pre&s;ide <HI>alternis annis,</HI> and
continue in office during life. <HI>Simler</HI> &s;aith they are
cho&s;en yearly by the Suffrages of both the Councils.
The manner of chu&s;ing Officers and Senators is this.
Behind a curtain according to the number of Com|petitors
are placed two, three, or more boxes. E|very
Senator hath given him a little medal or piece
of money for that purpo&s;e; and &s;o the Senators
go one by one behind the curtain, and put the
medal into what box they plea&s;e, and he that
hath mo&s;t of the&s;e pieces is under&s;tood to be cho|&s;en.
Out of the great Council is cho&s;en a le&s;&s;er of
the mo&s;t ancient and wi&s;e, who al&s;o continue du|ring
life, and judge in civil cau&s;es, and take care
of the ordinary concerns of the City; and for that
purpo&s;e they &s;it daily. They are divided into two
equal parts, 18 for the Summer, and 18 for the
Winter. If one of the Winter dies, tho&s;e of the Sum|mer
elect one into his place out of the 100, and
<HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> The great Council of 136 judge in cri|minal
cau&s;es. Tho&s;e of the le&s;&s;er Council have five
<PB N="429" REF="227">
<HI>Batz</HI> [about 10 <HI>d.</HI> or 1 <HI>s. Engli&s;h</HI>] and tho&s;e of the

&s;it in Council. All the people of the territory of this
city are Subjects, and divided into 19 or 20 <HI>Proefe|cturoe:</HI>
the number of fighting men about 18000.

than 5 Batz or a hen the man <HI>per annum</HI> to the

They have a Council of 40 (as they told us there)
but according to <HI>Simler</HI> of 45; 9 out of each Com|mune
and 18 out of the City. The 3 <HI>Communes</HI> have
the <HI>Landamman</HI> 6 years and the City 3. So that when
the <HI>Landamman</HI> is of a <HI>Commune</HI> he continues in
Office but two years, when of the City three years.
When one of the Council dies another is cho&s;en in|to
his place by major vote of all the males above 18
years of age of the City or that Community to which
he that died belonged. The Magi&s;trates are the &s;ame
and elected in like manner as in <HI>Vri</HI> and <HI>Switz,</HI> &amp;c.

to the City only. The City together with its
&s;ubjects can arm 4000 Souldiers: the 3 Communi|ties
not 2000. Yet are they obliged by ancient Con|vention
to bear two third parts of the charge in ca&s;e
there be nay war. In criminal cau&s;es they have 12
Judges taken out of the Council, 3 of the City and
3 of each Community. In civil the Senators judge
in their &s;everal Communities. To the general <HI>Diet</HI>
at <HI>Baden</HI> the City &s;ends one and the three Commu|nities
another. The nomination of the common
<HI>Lantvogts</HI> the City hath once and the Communities

twice. When the <HI>Landamman</HI> is of the Communi|ties
he is obliged during his Office to re&s;ide in the
City.</P>

portico's or Cloy&s;ters on each &s;ide. It lies &s;tret|ched
out in length upon a hill which I may call a <HI>Pe|nin&s;ula,</HI>
it is &s;o almo&s;t begirt about with the river.
On that &s;ide where it is not com|pa&s;&s;ed
with the river it is &s;trongly fortified with
good ba&s;tions and outworks. The Founder of this
City as al&s;o of <HI>Friburg</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and <HI>Friburg</HI>
in <HI>Bri&s;goia</HI> was <HI>Berchtoldus</HI> Duke of <HI>Zerin;</HI> as ap|pears
by the in&s;cription upon their moneys. To him
they have erected a monument in the great Church.
This Church is one of the hand&s;ome&s;t &s;tone-fabrics
in all <HI>Switzerland.</HI></P>
<P>The territory of this City is more then on third
part of the Countrey of the <HI>Sui&s;&s;es,</HI> and is divided
into 60 <HI>Praefecturae</HI> or Bailyages, be&s;ides 4 which are
common to them with <HI>Friburg.</HI> For this rea&s;on there
mu&s;t needs be many rich men in the City, though
they have but little trade. The <HI>Landtvogts</HI> or Bay|liffs
continue in office 6 years, during which time
they enrich them&s;elves well; yet do not their &s;ub|jects
complain, but acknowledge them&s;elves well
u&s;ed by their Governours. Heer they keep 5 or 6
Bears in a pit. The&s;e Bears I ob&s;erved to climb the
firr-trees growing in the pit, and delighting to &s;it
on the tops of them like birds on a perch. The Arms
of the Town is al&s;o a Bear, which they took I &s;up|po&s;e
alluding to their name <HI>Bern:</HI> And they fir&s;t
coyned the mony called Batzes from the figure of a
bear &s;tamped upon it: which afterward all the Can|tons
imitated, calling it al&s;o by the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>From <HI>Bern</HI> we rode to <HI>Friburg</HI> a hand&s;ome Town<NOTE PLACE="marg">17. Friburg.</NOTE>
<PB N="432" REF="229">
and the head of a Canton, built upon a hill almo&s;t
begirt with a river after the manner of <HI>Bern</HI> and by
the &s;ame Founder, on all &s;ides environed with hills,
&s;ave where it is continuous to the land. Their terri|tory
is &s;urrounded with and enclo&s;ed in the territory
of <HI>Bern.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Friburg</HI> we travelled through <HI>Maulton</HI> to
<HI>Lau&s;anna,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">18. Lau&s;an|na. Morges.</NOTE> a great Town and an Univer&s;ity, and
from <HI>Lau&s;anna April 19.</HI> through <HI>Morges</HI> a large
Town, <HI>Rolle</HI> and <HI>Nion</HI> con&s;iderable Towns by the
lake of <HI>Geneva's</HI> &s;ide and <HI>Verfoy</HI> a little Town on the
lake near <HI>Geneva,</HI> belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> and came
to our lodging at <HI>Geneva,</HI> where we re&s;ted and &s;o|journed
near 3 months.</P>
<P>The Governments of <HI>Soloturn. Bern</HI> and <HI>Friburg</HI>
are much like that of <HI>Lucern.</HI> In <HI>Soloturn</HI> the num|ber
of the le&s;&s;er Council is 35, and of the greater
115. When one of the 35 dies, the 34 remaining
chu&s;e one into his place out of the 115. When one
of the 115 dies or is advanced the re&s;t chu&s;e one in|to
his place out of the number of the Citizens. In
<HI>Bern</HI> the greater Council con&s;i&s;ts of 200, and the
le&s;&s;er (as we were told there) of 42, though <HI>Simler</HI>
makes them but 26. The&s;e Councils are cho&s;en by
20 Electors and the <HI>Sculthe&s;s, viz.</HI> the four <HI>Signiferi</HI>
of the City and 16 whom they pick out of the whole
body of the Citizens and joyn with them&s;elves. In
<HI>Friburg</HI> the le&s;&s;er Council is of 24 and the greater of
200. When one of the le&s;&s;er Council dies they chu&s;e
one into his place out of the greater: and when one
of the greater dies or is removed the le&s;&s;er (as I un|der&s;tood
them) chu&s;e one into his place out of the
number of the Citizens. All the&s;e Cities have 2
<HI>Sculteti</HI> or Con&s;uls who rule <HI>alternis annis.</HI> He that
de&s;ires a more full and particular account of the go|vernment
of the&s;e Cities may con&s;ult <HI>Simler de Re|pub.
Helvetiorum.</HI> Each of the Cantons have &s;ome
Saint or other to be their Patron and protector,
<PB N="433" REF="229">
who&s;e image the popi&s;h Cantons &s;et on the rever&s;e of
their monies, <HI>v. g. S. O&s;wald</HI> a King of <HI>England</HI>
Protector of <HI>Zug.</HI> In their Church they have his re|liques,
and have &s;et up his image on hor&s;eback. The
Prote&s;tant Cantons are <HI>Zurich, Bern Ba&s;el, Sehaf|hau&s;&s;e,</HI>
part of <HI>Glaris</HI> and part of <HI>Appenzel.</HI> That
which mo&s;t frequently breeds differences a quar|rels
among the Suitzers is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the com|mon
<HI>vogties</HI> or Bailywicks. For mo&s;t of the&s;e [I
mean the <HI>Dutch</HI> ones] being of the reformed reli|gion
are oppre&s;&s;ed and injured by the Popi&s;h <HI>Lant|vogts,</HI>
the Prote&s;tant Cantons not knowing how ei|ther
to help and relieve them or retaliate. For the
Popi&s;h Cantons being more in number than the Pro|te&s;tants,
they &s;end <HI>Lantvogts</HI> to the&s;e places twice to
the Prote&s;tants once. This one of the Mini&s;ters of
<HI>Zurich</HI> told me wad <HI>fundi &s;ui calamitas,</HI> and occa&s;ion|ed
the two late breaches among them. The <HI>Switzers</HI>
on each &s;ide are very &s;tiff in their Religion; the Pa|pi&s;ts
not permitting or tolerating one Prote&s;tant, nor
the Prote&s;tants one Papi&s;t in their proper territories.
Though the Cantons adhering to the Church of
<HI>Rome</HI> are more in number, yet the reformed are
much the greater, be&s;ides that their land is better,
very like to ours in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>Romani&s;ts</HI> are ac|counted
the better Souldiers, and good rea&s;on they
have, being more exerci&s;ed in War, &s;erving the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Kings, as being of the &s;ame Re|ligion.
Be&s;ides, the <HI>Zurichers</HI> who anciently had
the reputation for valour, are now much given to
merchandi&s;e and to accumulate riches, and &s;o taken
off from martial &s;tudies and exerci&s;es. The <HI>Berne&s;e</HI>
though they have far the greate&s;t and be&s;t territory
of all (&s;o that it's &s;aid they can arm as many men
as the Dutchy of <HI>Milan;</HI> &s;end into the field 100000
Souldiers and yet leave enough at home to till the
land) yet have they no reputation for Souldiers; they
lo&s;t their credit quite in the late skirmi&s;h with the
<PB N="434" REF="230">
<HI>Lucerne&s;e,</HI> who account them rather <HI>Savoyards</HI> than
<HI>Switzers.</HI> All the Cantons of <HI>Switzerland</HI> coyn
money except <HI>Appenzel, Vnderwald</HI> and <HI>Glaris,</HI> of
which <HI>Glaris</HI> formerly hath coined though now it
doth not. All the Swizzers in general are very ho|ne&s;t
people, king and civil to &s;trangers. One may
travel their Countrey &s;ecurely with a bag of gold in
his hand. When we came to out Inns they would be
troubled if we di&s;tru&s;ted them &s;o far &agrave;s to take our
Portmanteau's into our lodging-chambers and not
leave them in the common dining rooms. They keep
their hou&s;es very clean and polite like our good
hou&s;ewives in <HI>England.</HI> For plants, going from
<HI>Zurich</HI> to <HI>Mellingen</HI> we ob&s;erved common <HI>Goo&s;eberry</HI>
in the hedges and by the way-&s;ides very plentifully,
and in &s;ome places <HI>Barberries. Sigillum Solomonis</HI> and
<HI>Herba Paris</HI> are the mo&s;t common plants that grow
in this Countrey in the woods and hedges every
where: <HI>Anonymus flore Coluteae</HI> on the mountains

<P><HI>Geneva</HI> is plea&s;antly &s;eated at the lower end of the
<HI>Lacus Lemanus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Geneva.</NOTE> now called <HI>Genffer-zee</HI> or the lake
of <HI>Geneva,</HI> upon a hill &s;ide re&s;pecting the lake; &s;o
that from the lake you have a fair pro&s;pect of the
whole Town. It is divided by the river <HI>Rhodanus</HI> or
<HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> into two parts, which are joyned together by
two wooden bridges, one of which hath on each
&s;ide a row of hou&s;es after the manner of <HI>London|bridge,</HI>
only they are low. The two principal and
indeed only con&s;iderable &s;treets in the Town are the
low &s;treet [<HI>R&uuml;e bas</HI>] which runs along by the river
and lakes &s;ide: and the high &s;treet or great &s;treet
[<HI>R&uuml;e grand</HI>] which runs up the hill. The City is
indifferently &s;trong, and they have lately been at
great expences to fortific it <HI>alla moderna</HI> with ram|parts
<PB N="435" REF="230">
and ba&s;tions of earth. Though it be but &s;mall
yet is it very populous, being &s;uppo&s;ed to contain
30000 &s;ouls, St. <HI>Peter's</HI> Church, formerly the Ca|thedral,
is hand&s;ome and well-built, and in it
is a &s;tately monument for the Duke of <HI>Rohan.</HI> The
Citizens are very bu&s;ie and indu&s;trious, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting
chiefly by trading: the whole territory of this Re|public
being not &s;o great as &s;ome one Noblemans
e&s;tate in <HI>England</HI> for extent of land. All provi&s;ions
of victuals are very plentiful and cheap at <HI>Geneva,</HI>
e&s;pecially milk-meats, the neighbouring mountains
feeding abundance of cattel.</P>
<P>The tops of <HI>Jura, Saleve</HI> and other high moun|tains
of <HI>Savoy, Daulphiny</HI> and the <HI>Alps,</HI> where they
are bare of wood, put forth very good gra&s;s &s;o &s;oon
as the &s;now is melted off them, which u&s;ually is
about or before mid-May. And then the Countrey
people drive up their cattel to pa&s;ture, and feed
them there for three months time. Upon the&s;e hill
tops they have heer and there low &s;heds or dairy
hou&s;es, which &s;erve the men to live in and to make
their butter and chee&s;e in, &s;o long as they keep their
bea&s;ts above. The men I &s;ay, for they only a&s;cend
up thither and do all the dairy work, leaving their
wives to keep hou&s;e below; it being too toil&s;ome
for them to clamber up &s;uch high and &s;teep hills. By
rea&s;on of the&s;e cotes it is very convenient &s;impling
upon the mountains, for if a man be hungry or
thir&s;ty he may &s;oon find relief at one of them. We
always found the people very kind and willing to
give us &s;uch as they had, <HI>viz.</HI> brown bread, milk,
whey, butter, curds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for which we could &s;ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ce
fa&s;ten any mony uon them.</P>
<P>For the temper of the air in re&s;pect of heat and
cold <HI>Geneva</HI> I think is very like <HI>England,</HI> there being
no great exce&s;s of either extreme. The City is well
governed, vice di&s;countenanced, and the people ei|ther
really better or at lea&s;t more re&s;trained then in
<PB N="436" REF="231">
other places: Though they do take liberty to &s;hoot
and u&s;e other &s;ports and exerci&s;es upon the Lords
day, yet mo&s;t of their Mini&s;ters di&s;allow it and
preach again&s;t it.</P>

<P>At <HI>Montpellier</HI> I ob&s;erved the manner of making
oil-olive:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The man|ner of making Oil olive.</NOTE> Fir&s;t they take olives, whether fre&s;h ga|thered
or laid a while on a heap it matters not (as
they told me) and brui&s;e or grind them to a pa&s;te, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">as
we do apples to make cider, with a perpendicular
mill-&s;tone running round in a trough. This pa&s;te
or the olives thus brui&s;ed they put in round thin ba&s;|kets
made of <HI>Spartum</HI> like frails, having a round
hole in the top; but both top and bottom clapping
together, &s;o that when pre&s;&s;ed they look like a thin
round cake. Half a &s;core or more of the&s;e baskets
filled with olive pouce they lay on a heap in the pre&s;s
and letting down the pre&s;s-beam, &s;queeze them at
fir&s;t without any mixture. Then winding up the
beam they take out the baskets, and into each one
put a good quantity of &s;calding water, (which they
have always ready) and &s;haking the basket mingle it
with the pouce and then piling them one upon an|other
as before, pre&s;s them down a &s;econd time.
This &s;econd operation they repeat again, and then
taking out the pouce put in new and proceed as
before. The oil together with the water runs out in|to
ve&s;&s;els &s;et to receive it. The water with the <HI>Amur|ca</HI>
&s;inks to the bottom, and the oil &s;wims above it,
which they take off with a copper di&s;h like a fleeting
di&s;h, as good hou&s;ewives ski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the cream from their
milk. The water mixed with the red juyce of the
olives becomes red and thick, not at all mingling
with the oil, &s;o that it cannot ea&s;ily the lea&s;t drop
of it be taken up without perceiving it. Its &s;aid that
in <HI>Provence</HI> they &s;pread their olives on a floor after
they are gathered, and there let them re&s;t 30 days to
dry, and for that rea&s;on their oil is better than that
of <HI>Languedoc.</HI> Others lay them on a heap a while to
let them &s;weat, as they call it. It is worth the no|ting
that though the olives be very bitter and of a
<PB N="459" REF="242">
firy ungrateful ta&s;te, yet the on which is drawn from
them is &s;weet; the like is ob&s;erved in bitter Al|monds,
and it is very likely might be in all other
bitter fruits; which is a &s;ufficient proof that the ta&s;te
of &s;uch fruits doth not inhere in the oil, at lea&s;t
which is made by expre&s;&s;ion; and it de&s;erves exa|mination,
whether the chymical oil may not al&s;o be
deve&s;ted of the ta&s;te of the vegetable from which it
is extracted.</P>
<P>Olives when they come to maturity change colour
and become black as &s;ome other plums do, but it is
very late in the year fir&s;t. They are then notwith|&s;tanding
of a horrid and ungrateful ta&s;te, firing the
throat and palate of one that eats them. They afford
mo&s;t oil when fully ripe, but be&s;t (as they told us)
when gathered and pre&s;&s;ed green. Sometimes they
pickle ripe olives, but they will not la&s;t; therefore
tho&s;e which they pickle to &s;end abroad are gathered
green. The pickle they u&s;e is nothing el&s;e but a brine

any water.</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> 1. We intended to have &s;een the Coral-fi&s;hing
heer, but the windy weather hindred us. The
Sea mu&s;t be very calm and &s;mooth, el&s;e it is impo&s;|&s;ible
for them to fi&s;h for it. It grows downward (as
the urinators told us) under the hollow rocks, and
not upwards as trees. I believe rather that it grows
indifferently either upwards or downwards accord|ing
to the &s;ituation of the rocks.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="246">

A, B, C, D, a round net. To the lead at E is fa&s;t|ned
a long rope. They go out in little boats and let
down this cro&s;s; and when they have found a rock
at the bottom of the Sea, he that manages the rope
thru&s;ts it into the hollows, getting in one or two of
the legs, and if there be any coral it entangles in
the nets at the end of the cro&s;s, by which it is torn
off and brought up. The natural colour of the coral
while it is alive and growing to the rocks is a pale
carneous; but when the &s;curf (which an&s;wers to
the bark in trees) is rubbed off, it is red. The Coral
that dies or is broken off from the rocks lo&s;es that
carneous &s;curf or bark in the Sea and becomes red,
though &s;ometimes it gets a greeni&s;h white ru&s;t. They

three or four pounds weight. It rots, dies, grows
light, worm-eaten and full of holes like wood. They
all affirmed it to be hard and not &s;oft as it grows un|der

Ancients, <HI>Moliis fuit herba &s;ub undis.</HI> I believe the
outward &s;curf or bark may be &s;oft, it ea&s;ily crum|bling
off afterwards, which might give occa&s;ion to
the fable. They told us that a piece of Coral (having
the carneous &s;curf upon it) wetted is ju&s;t the &s;ame as
when it is fir&s;t taken out of the Sea. The be&s;t Coral
rude as it is found is worth a Pi&s;tol the pound, or

the nature of the &s;oil that was fit to nouri&s;h the

gather them when fully ripe, and dip them in a
boiling <HI>Lixivium</HI> of water and a&s;hes, ju&s;t dipping
them in, and taking them out again; and then dry
them upon boards in the &s;un, taking them in by

from <HI>Racemus.</HI> Figs are dried ju&s;t as they are ga|thered,
not being dipt into any <HI>lixivium.</HI></P>
<P>I went to <HI>Olives,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">26.</NOTE> where and at <HI>Gandia</HI> are the
Engines for Sugar-works, the be&s;t are at <HI>Olives.</HI> By
the way we &s;aw the Sugar-canes growing in &s;everal
places. They are planted in low wet grounds,
well mucked and dre&s;&s;ed, divided into beds or hil|locks
are furrows. They cut the canes clo&s;e to the
roots in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> and cutting of the
&s;lender tops, which afford no good juice, keep them
under ground till <HI>March,</HI> and then prick them into
<PB N="478" REF="252">
the&s;e hillocks or beds; out of every <HI>talea</HI> or cut &s;hoot
4, 5, or 6 canes, which will be ripe the next Decem|ber.
The knots or joynts of the cane at the bot|tom
are very clo&s;e together, &s;carce an inch a&s;under,
but upwards the di&s;tance is more as the cane grows
&s;lenderer. Within is a white pulp or pith, full of
&s;ap, &s;weet as honey. They &s;ell them at <HI>Gandia</HI> to
eat, and cutting them into pieces ju&s;t in the middle
between two knots, &s;uck the pieces at both ends.
To make &s;ugar, after the canes are clean&s;ed from the
tops and leaves, and cut into pieces, they are fir&s;t
brui&s;ed either with a perpendicular &s;tone running
round, as apples to make cider, or olives to make
oil; or between two axes &s;trongly capped with iron
horizontally placed and turned contrary ways; and
then pre&s;&s;ed as grapes or olives are. The juice thus
pre&s;&s;ed out is boiled in three &s;everal Cauldrons, one
after another. In the third Cauldron it becomes
thick and black, and is then put into conical pots
which at the bottom have a little hole &s;topped only
with cour&s;e and foul &s;ugar; Mr. <HI>Ligon</HI> &s;aith with
Plantain leaves. The&s;e pots are covered when full
with a cake of pa&s;t, made of a kind of earth called
in Spani&s;h <HI>Gritto,</HI> and found near <HI>Olives,</HI> which is
good to take &s;pots out of clothes, which cap or
cover &s;inks as the &s;ugar &s;inks. [Mr. <HI>Swift</HI> told me
that the clay they u&s;e with us is tobacco-pipe clay,
or very like it, and that the water in the clay &s;erved
to wa&s;h down and carry away the <HI>Molo&s;&s;os,</HI> at lea&s;t
the clay helps the &s;eparation and precipitation of it]
The&s;e conical pots are put into other pots, into
which by the hole at the <HI>vertex</HI> the juice dreins
down through the cour&s;e &s;ugar at the bottom. It
dreins &s;o for 5 or 6 moneths, in which time the &s;u|gar
in the conical pots grows hard and white, all
the juice being either drunk up by the lute, or run
out by the hole at the <HI>vertex.</HI> This juice is boiled a|gain
&s;o long as it is good for any thing, but at la&s;t
<PB N="479" REF="252">
it makes only a foul red &s;ugar that will never be bet|ter.
The conical loaves of &s;ugar after they are taken
out are &s;et to drein over the &s;ame pots for 14 or 15
days. To make the &s;ugar more white they mu&s;t boil
it again, but about one &s;ixth is lo&s;t every time. A
pound, of &s;ugar of 12 ounces is &s;old at <HI>Olives</HI> for
three <HI>&s;ous</HI> and a half; refined for 5 or 6 <HI>&s;ous.</HI> The
&s;ugar-juice is &s;trained through &s;trainers of linnen, as
it is put out of one Cauldron into another. They take
it out of the fir&s;t and &s;econd Cauldrons &s;o &s;oon as it
begins to boil: but in the third Cauldron they let it
boil till the &s;cum ri&s;es, and then take off only the
&s;cum with a &s;cummer, and put it into a long trough
to cool, and when it is cool put it into the conical
pots. One &s;cum ri&s;es after another in the third
Cauldron. The &s;cum when it is taken off is white,
but turns to a black liquor in the trough. They
never refine the &s;ugar more than 3 or four times.
They u&s;e for the refining of it whites of eggs putting
in 2 or 3 dozen into a Cauldron. They u&s;e but one
Cauldron for refining. When it is refined it grows
white and hard in 9 or 10 days. The juice boiled up
is eaten with bread to&s;ted as honey: The juice of the
refined &s;ugar is much better than the fir&s;t juice. The
Duke of <HI>Gandia</HI> &s;ends pre&s;ents of this refined juice
to the Queen of <HI>Spain.</HI> When they refine it they
put in a little water into the cauldrons to di&s;&s;olve it
the better. But for a more exact de&s;cription of the
whole proce&s;s of the Sugar-works, I refer to <HI>Pi&s;o</HI>

which there is a famous pair of &s;tone-&s;tairs, each
&s;tep being of one entire &s;tone and &s;upported only on

is not above 150 or 200, though the town be very
populous conteining about 24000 &s;ouls. Once in a
year all the names of this 150 or 200 are put into an
urn, and a child takes out 8 to be Electors. Every
one of this 8 chu&s;es his man. the old Magi&s;trates
that are ju&s;t then going out divide the&s;e 8 that the
Electors have cho&s;en into 4 pairs, fitting them as
well as they can, <HI>v. g.</HI> an old man and a young to|gether,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e 4 pairs are put into an urn. The
fir&s;t pair that are drawn out are the two <HI>Alcaldas</HI>
for
that year; the &s;econd pair the two Deputy <HI>Alcal|das;</HI>
the third pair the two <HI>Regidores</HI> the fourth pair

<P><HI>Spain</HI> is in many places, not to &s;ay mo&s;t, very thin
of people, and almo&s;t de&s;olate. The cau&s;es are
1. A bad Religion. 2. The tyrannical Inqui&s;ition.
3. The multitude of Whores. 4. The barrenne&s;s
of the Soil. 5. The wretched lazine&s;s of the peo|ple,
very like the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> walking &s;lowly
and always cumbred with a great Cloke and long
Sword. 6. The expul&s;ion of the Jews and Moors,
the fir&s;t of which were planted there by the Empe|rour
<HI>Adrian,</HI> and the latter by the Caliphs after the
Conque&s;t of <HI>Spain.</HI> 7. Wars and Plantations. In
all the Towns e&s;pecially in the South and We&s;t parts
of <HI>Spain</HI> a great many ruines of hou&s;es to be &s;een.
Within a quarter of a league of a Town you begin
to &s;ee ground ploughed, el&s;e all a wild Countrey,
and nothing but Ro&s;emary, Ci&s;tus, Juniper, Laven|der,
Broom, Lenti&s;cus, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> growing in the fields,
and on the hills. Little or no hay any where in <HI>Spain,</HI>
they feeding their mules and hor&s;es with &s;traw. At
lea&s;t one half of <HI>Spain</HI> is mountainous.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> are not &s;o ab&s;tinent as mo&s;t people
take them to be, eating the be&s;t they can get, and
freely enough if it be at another mans co&s;t: and in
Inns never refu&s;ing Partridges, Quails, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for the
<PB N="494" REF="260">
dearne&s;s if they have but money. Lazine&s;s and &s;loth
makes them poor, and poverty makes them pinch
their bellies and fare hardly. They &s;eldom mingle
water with their wine, it being a common &s;aying
among them <HI>Vino poco &amp; puro,</HI> though all over
<HI>Spain</HI> the wine is very hot and &s;trong. They delight
much in <HI>Pimentone,</HI> i. e. <HI>Guiny</HI> pepper and mingle it
with all their &s;auces. In roa&s;ting of meat they ne|ver
u&s;e dripping pans but draw the coals ju&s;t under
the meat, which though it be not &s;o cleanly yet is
the quicker and more thrifty way for &s;aving of few|el.
They tear Rabbets in &s;under with their hands
when they are almo&s;t roa&s;ted, and &s;tew them in a
pot with water and <HI>Pimentone.</HI> To toa&s;t bread they
throw it upon the coals. They long and ask for
every thing they &s;ee, to avoid which a Merchant
that travelled with me was wont to put in &s;ome
thing into his victuals which they did not love.
They take Tobacco much in &s;nuff, and if one take
out a box of &s;nuff he mu&s;t give &s;ome to all the
company. The be&s;t per&s;on in the company at
table cuts and tears the meat in pieces, and gives
to every one his &s;hare.</P>
<P>They are mo&s;t impertinently inqui&s;itive, whence
you come? whither you go? what bu&s;ine&s;s you
have, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mo&s;t horribly rude, in&s;olent and imperi|ous,
uncivil to &s;trangers, asking them, What do
you come into our Countrey for? we do not go into
yours. [This is to be under&s;tood of the middle and
inferiour &s;ort of people, many of the Gentry be|ing
very civil and well-bred.] Their children are
the mo&s;t unmannerly and ill-bred of any in the
world. The &s;ons of <HI>French</HI> fathers and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
women when they are grown up often turn their
fathers out of doors, having many privileges above
them for being born in <HI>Spain.</HI> They are ex|tremely
given to lying. <HI>Almuzzos</HI> and &s;uch kind
of fellows not to be believed or tru&s;ted in any thing
they promi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="495" REF="260">
They ride altogether upon mules, and carry their
Portmanteau's before them, for fear they &s;hould be
lo&s;t or &s;tollen from behind them; they lie between
a high pummel of the &s;addle and an iron hook.
In&s;tead of &s;tirrops per&s;ons of quality u&s;e great clogs
of wood of the &s;hape of &s;hooes without heels.
They cut away the mules hair clo&s;e to the skin under
the Saddles, and Portmanteau's to avoid galling.
Of this ba&s;tard breed of Animals the males are u&s;u|ally
bigger than the females. <HI>Q.</HI> Whether the rea|&s;on

They are to be hired at a very cheap rate. It
were a &s;hame to mention their impudence, lewd|ne&s;s

<P>They are &s;o lazy that in their &s;hops they will &s;ay

look for it: not to be hired to carry a Portmantean,
go of an errand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but at an exce&s;&s;ive rate. Mer|cers
never tie up any thing they &s;ell, and if they al|low
paper, they only rudely mumble up the com|modities
in it. Of their fanta&s;tical and ridiculous
pride, and that too in the extreme&s;t poverty all

them&s;elves too good for, they pre&s;ently &s;ay &s;end for
a <HI>French-man.</HI> Indeed the <HI>French</HI> do almo&s;t all the
work in <HI>Spain.</HI> All the&s;e be&s;t &s;hops are kept by
French-men, the be&s;t workmen in every kind are
<HI>French,</HI> and I believe near &frac14; or &frac15; part of the people
in <HI>Spain</HI> are of that Nation. I have heard &s;ome tra|vellers
&s;ay, that &s;hould the King of <HI>France</HI> recal all
his Subjects out of <HI>Spain,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would ha|zard
to be all &s;tarved to death.</P>
<P>Bread is very &s;carce and very dear in many places
or <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e of the barrenne&s;s of the &s;oil
and want of rain, but chiefly becau&s;e of the &s;loth
of the people in letting a great deal of ground lie
untilled, and in not taking the pains to fetch corn
and bread from tho&s;e places where there is plenty.
So that in a days journey the price of bread will be
trebled, and in another days journey fall as much
again. This Summer there was a tumult at <HI>Ma|drid:</HI>
the poor people gathering about the Kings pa|lace
cried out, Let the King live, but let the ill go|vernment
die; let exactors die, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> ju&s;t as they did
at <HI>Nuples</HI> in the rebellion under <HI>Ma&s;aniello.</HI> Upon
which the King &s;ent to all the Towns about for
bread-corn, and in two or three days bread was
very plentiful and cheap. All over <HI>Catalonia</HI> bread
was very cheap. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> bread is commended
for the be&s;t of the world, and well it may be, if as
we have heard, they pick their wheat grain by
grain.</P>
<P>At my being at <HI>Madrid</HI> there was an Engineer
there &s;ent by the Emperour, that had invented a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">low, called by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> a <HI>Sembrador,</HI> to
&s;ow corn at equal di&s;tances, and one grain in a hole;
the de&s;cription whereof hath been &s;ince publi&s;hed in
the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions.</HI></P>
<P>In all kind of good learning the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are
<PB N="498" REF="262">
behind the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> under&s;tanding nothing at
all but a little of the old wrangling Philo&s;ophy and
School-divinity.</P>
<P>The people are much di&s;contented all over <HI>Spain,</HI>
complaining of Taxes, evil Coun&s;ellours, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but
they have a good opinion of and age generally well-affected
to their King, who&s;e intentions they &s;ay
are very good.</P>
<P>As for their habit and dre&s;s in that they are to be
commended that they are con&s;tant to the &s;ame fa|&s;hions,
though they be not the mo&s;t convenient
that might be devi&s;ed. To change for the better I
think it rather commendable than blame-worthy;
but to change out of meer levity or an api&s;h imita|tion
of others is fooli&s;h and unrea&s;onable. They
wear great hats with broad crowns and the top
breader than the bottom. Their hair mo&s;t com|monly,
but e&s;pecially when they travel, they tie up
in a knot behind, aud &s;ometimes braid like womens.
Their bands lie upon black collars ju&s;t of the &s;ame
bigne&s;s or a little bigger. They are joyned to the
collar and they put on collar and band together.
They wear very much Cambrick half-&s;hirts, and
have their &s;leeves open before and behind both Win|ter
and Summer; they have great skirts upon their
doublets. Their breeches are very &s;treight and clo&s;e
to their thighs, and buttoned down on each &s;ide,
and reach a little lower than the knee. They wear
very &s;light-wrought black &s;ilk-&s;tockins, that the
white linnen-&s;tockings which they wear under|neath
may be &s;een through them. Their &s;hooes
ju&s;t fit for their feet, very light and thin, with low
heels. Over their doublets they wear a clo&s;e coat or
jerkin with open &s;leeves like the doublet, and for
the mo&s;t part with hanging &s;leeves like childrens,
yet never reaching lower than their skirts: a very
long &s;word, and a &s;hort dagger hanging ju&s;t behind
them, and at la&s;t over all a cloak with a great cape.
<PB N="499" REF="262">
The women wear great Vardingales, &s;tanding &s;o far
out an each &s;ide, that to enter in at an ordinary
door they are fain to go &s;ide-ways: when they go
abroad are covered with a vail of black having only
a hole left for one eye. The poor people wear
&s;hooes made of packthread.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t noble &s;port in <HI>Spain</HI> is the <HI>Jeu de Tau|reau,</HI>
or Bull-fighting, practi&s;ed at <HI>Valentia, Ma|drid,</HI>
&amp;c. At <HI>Madrid</HI> 3 times in the year, where in
the Market-place a brave Don on hor&s;eback, and
a great many pages on foot fight with a wild Bull:
When one Bull is killed or much wounded they turn
in another. Seldom but &s;ome of the pages are kil|led.
And with the&s;e cruel and bloody &s;pectacles
the people are much delighted, as were the <HI>Romans</HI>
of old in the time of Heatheni&s;m.</P>
