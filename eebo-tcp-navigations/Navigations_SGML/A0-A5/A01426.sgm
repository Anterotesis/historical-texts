<P>_RIght Honorable, while I went
about to publi&s;h our Engli&s;h
Voyages and Di&s;coueries, I
was adui&s;ed by ma&s;ter WAL|TER
COPE, a gentleman of
rare and excellent parts, to
draw them into a &s;hort &s;um,
adding that in his opinion
that cour&s;e woulde prooue
mo&s;t acceptable to the world,
e&s;pecially to men of great action and employment. Al|though
in that worke then vnder the pre&s;&s;e I could not
conueniently alter my cour&s;e, yet holding his adui&s;e, as in
many things el&s;e, &s;o in this for &s;ound and very good,
I heere pre&s;ent vnto your Honour a briefe Treatie
mo&s;t agreeable to the &s;ame. The authour whereof was
<PB REF="3">
one <HI>Antonie Galuano,</HI> a Portugall gentleman: of who&s;e
pietie towards God, equitie towards men, fidelity to his
Prince, loue to his countrey, skill in &s;ea cau&s;es, experi|ence
in Hi&s;tories, liberalitie towards his nation, vigi|lance,
valour, wi&s;edome and diligence in re&s;toring &amp; &s;et|ling
the decaied &s;tate of The I&s;les of Maluco, (where he
remained &s;ixe or &s;euen yeeres gouernour,) if it plea&s;e
your Honour to read <HI>Fernando Lopez de Castagneda,</HI> or
<HI>Ioannes Maffeius</HI> in their Hi&s;tories of The Ea&s;t Indies,
you &s;hall finde more written in his &s;ingular commendati|on,
then a large Epi&s;tle can well comprehend.</P>
<P>The worke though &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">all in bulke containeth &s;o
much rare and profitable matter, as I know not where to
&s;eeke the like, within &s;o narrow and &s;treite a compa&s;&s;e.
For heerein is orderly declared, who were The fir&s;t Di&s;|couerours
of the world &s;ince the time of the flood: by
what waies from age to age the &s;picerie, drugs, and riches
of the Ea&s;t were conueied into The We&s;t: what were the
cau&s;es of the alterations of tho&s;e cour&s;es, as namely the
changes of Empires and gouernments: The cea&s;ing of
all trafficke for many yeeres by The Gothes inua&s;ion of
the Romane Empire: The ri&s;ing vp of The Mahumetane
&s;ect; with their ouerrunning of Afrike and Spaine: The
renewing againe, after many yeeres di&s;turbance, of the
trafficke and entercour&s;e of The Ea&s;t Indies; fir&s;t by the
Califas of the afore&s;aid &s;ect: and eft&s;oones by The Vene|tians,
Ienowais and Florentines. Then followeth the ta|king
of Ceuta in Barbarie by <HI>Iohn</HI> the fir&s;t king of Portu|gall
of that name in the yeere of our Lord 1415. who&s;e
third &s;onne <HI>Don Henry</HI> (which he had by the vertuous La|die
<HI>Philippa,</HI> daughter of <HI>Iohn</HI> of Gante, and &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Henry</HI>
the fourth, king of England) was the fir&s;t beginner of all
the Portugall di&s;coueries, and continued the &s;ame for the
&s;pace of fortie and three yeeres euen to his dying day.
<PB REF="3">
By who&s;e encouragement the kings of Portugall found
out with much patience and con&s;tancie the la&s;t way of
the bringing the Spicerie into Europe by The Cape of
Buona Speran&ccedil;a; and for the&s;e hundred yeeres pa&s;t haue
become the chiefe Lords of the riches of the Orient By
emulation of which their good endeuours, The Antiles
and The we&s;t Indies began to be di&s;couered by The kings
of Spaine. The infancies of both which mo&s;t important
enterpri&s;es, The progre&s;&s;e of the &s;ame from time to time,
the di&s;coueries of I&s;lands, riuers, baies and harbours, of
many rich prouinces, kingdomes, and countries; The
erecting of ca&s;tles in &s;undry conuenient I&s;lands and pla|ces,
with the drawing of trafficke vnto the &s;ame, where,
when, by whom, and by who&s;e authority is heere &s;uccinct|ly
and faithfully recorded. So that if it plea&s;e your Ho|nour
at your conuenient lei&s;ure to take a &s;ea card or a
mappe of the world, and carie your eie vpon the coa&s;t of
Africa from Cape de Non, lying on the mayne in 29.
degrees of northerly latitude, and follow the &s;hore about
the Cape of Buona Speran&ccedil;a till you come to the mouth
of The Redde Sea, and pa&s;&s;ing thence along by the coun|trey
of Arabia cro&s;&s;e ouer to India, and doubling Cape
Comory compa&s;&s;e the gulfe of Bengala, &amp; &s;hooting by
the citie of Malacca through The &s;treite of Cincapura,
coa&s;t al the &s;outh of A&s;ia to the northea&s;t part of China,
and comprehend in this view all the I&s;lands from The
A&ccedil;ores and Madera in the We&s;t, to The Malucoes,
The Philippinas, and Iapan in the Ea&s;t: you &s;hall heere
finde by order, who were the fir&s;t di&s;couerours, conque|rours
and planters in euery place: as al&s;o the natures
and commodities of the &s;oyles, togither with the forces,
qualities, and conditions of the inhabitants. And that
which I mention of the Orient, is likewi&s;e to be vnder|&s;tood
of The Occident.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
Now touching the tran&s;lation, it may plea&s;e you &s;ir, to
be aduerti&s;ed that it was fir&s;t done into our language by
&s;ome hone&s;t and well affected marchant of our nation,
who&s;e name by no meanes I could attaine vnto, and
that as it &s;eemeth many yeeres ago. For it hath lien by
me aboue the&s;e twelue yeeres. In all which &s;pace though
I haue made much inquirie, and &s;ent to Lisbon, where
it &s;eemeth it was printed, yet to this day I could neuer
obtaine the originall copie; whereby I might reforme
the manifold errours of the tran&s;lator. For whereas a
good tran&s;lator ought to be well acquainted with the
proprietie of the tongue out of which, and of that into
which he tran&s;lateth, and thirdly with the &s;ubiect or mat|ter
it &s;elfe: I found this tran&s;lator very defectiue in all
three; e&s;pecially in the la&s;t. For the &s;upplying of who&s;e
defects I had none other remedie, but to haue recour&s;e
vnto the originall hi&s;tories, (which as it appeereth are
very many, and many of them exceeding rare and hard
to come by) out of which the authour him&s;elfe drew the
greate&s;t part of this di&s;cour&s;e. And in very deede it co&s;t
me more trauaile to &s;earch out the grounds thereof, and
to annexe the marginall quotations vnto the worke, then
the tran&s;lation of many &s;uch bookes would haue put me
vnto. Of which quotations there is yet a farther v&s;e; to
wit, that &s;uch as haue lea&s;ure &s;ufficient, and are de&s;irous to
reade the&s;e things more at large, (for breuitie oftentimes
breedeth ob&s;curitie) may fully &s;atisfie their de&s;ires by ha|uing
recour&s;e by the helpe therof to the pure fountaines,
out of which tho&s;e waters which are drawne are for the
mo&s;t part mo&s;t &s;weete and hol&s;ome. Now if any man
&s;hall maruel, that in the&s;e <HI>Di&s;coueries</HI> of <HI>The World</HI> for the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pace almo&s;t of fower thou&s;and yeeres here &s;et downe,
our nation is &s;carce fower times mentioned: Hee is to
vnder&s;tand, that when this authour ended this di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB REF="4">
(which was about the yeere of Grace 1555.) there was
little extant of our mens trauailes. And for ought I can
&s;ee, there had no great matter yet come to light, if my
&s;elfe had not vndertaken that heauie burden, being neuer
therein entertained to any purpo&s;e, vntill I had recour&s;e
vnto your &s;elfe, by who&s;e &s;peciall fauour and bountifull
patronage I haue been often much encouraged, and as it
were reuiued. Which trauailes of our men, becau&s;e as
yet they be not come to ripenes, and haue been made for
the mo&s;t part to places fir&s;t di&s;couered by others; when
they &s;hall come to more perfection, and become more
profitable to the aduenturers, will then be more fit to be
reduced into briefe epitomes, by my &s;elfe or &s;ome other
endued with an hone&s;t zeale of the honour of our coun|trey.
In the meane &s;ea&s;on nothing doubting of your fa|uourable
acceptation of this my labour, I humbly be&s;eech
the authour of all goodnes to repleni&s;h and enrich you
with his be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, long to protect and pre&s;erue your
Honour to the profitable &s;eruice of her Maie&s;tie,
and to the common benefit and good
of the Realme. From London

<P><HI>_ANtonie Galuano</HI> vpon his death bed
left vnto me in his te&s;tament among
his papers this booke. And becau&s;e
I am certaine he ordained it to bee
pre&s;ented vnto your Grace, I haue
thought good herein to fulfill his wil

I haue done nothing, the fault remaining not in me. And
by all rea&s;on this treatie ought to be &s;et foorth by a Por|tugall,
&s;eeing it intreateth of the variable waies from
whence the pepper and &s;pices came in times pa&s;t into
our partes, and al&s;o of all the nauigations and di&s;coueries
in the old time: In both of which things the Portugals
haue mo&s;t trauailed. In this treatie and in nine or ten
bookes of things touching Maluco and India (which the
Cardinall willed me to giue to <HI>Damian de Goes,</HI> &s;aying
that he &s;hould content me, for otherwi&s;e I could not de|liuer
them) this true Portugall occupied him&s;elfe again&s;t
the vnfortunate and &s;orrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ull times which he had been
in (which were all ended before all our daies and times:)<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antonie Gal|uano Captaine of Maluco.</NOTE>
for when he receiued the captain&s;hip and fortre&s;&s;es of
Maluco, all the kings and gouernours of all the Ilands
about being agreed to make war again&s;t the Portugals,
vntill &s;uch time as they might driue them all out of the
countrey, he fought again&s;t them all&punc; with onely 130. Por|tugals,
when they were all together, and &s;trong in Tidore;
and he gaue them the ouerthrow and killed their king, and
one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ernate,</HI> the principal author of that war, and he tooke
<PB REF="6">
from them their fortre&s;&s;e: &s;o vpon this victorie they &s;ub|mitted
them&s;elues, and came vnder the obei&s;ance and &s;er|uice
of our king of Portugall. Herein two things happe|ned
of great admiration&punc; The fir&s;t, that all the kings and
gouernours of Maluco agreed togither again&s;t vs, a thing
that neuer fell out, nor yet credible to be like to happen:
for they are euer at variance among them&s;elues:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Variance v&s;u|ally amon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the kings of Ma|luco.</NOTE> The &s;e|cond,
that the captaine of Maluco with onely his ordina|rie
&s;oldiers &s;hould haue the victorie again&s;t &s;o many be|ing
all together. For &s;ometimes it happeneth that &s;ome
of the captaines of Maluco with many extraordinarie
&s;oldiers be&s;ides their ordinarie, yea and with the aide of
al the Kings and Lords of Maluco in their fauour and aide
went again&s;t one King onely of them, and came backe
againe with lo&s;&s;e. So there may be reckoned three notable
things done in India, I &s;ay of qualitie: (but of more quan|titie
<MILESTONE N="1"> and importance there haue been others:) which were
<MILESTONE N="2"> the taking of Muar by <HI>Emmanuel Falcon,</HI> and the winning
<MILESTONE N="3"> of Bitam by <HI>Peter Ma&s;carenas,</HI> and this, whereof we pre|&s;ently
treate. For all the&s;e three deedes &s;eemed to be im|po&s;&s;ible
to be atchieued, con&s;idering the &s;mall quantitie
of &s;oldiers which the captaines had in giuing the enter|pri&s;e
again&s;t &s;o many; with the order and maner by them
ordained how and which waies to obtaine their purpo&s;e
as well by their enimies as by them&s;elues. And they could
not be atchieued otherwi&s;e but by v&s;ing a meane and or|der
not thought of at the fir&s;t by the Portugals, nor yet
euer &s;u&s;pected by their enimies. And, be&s;ides this, his fa|ther
and fower of his brethren were all &s;laine in the kings
&s;eruice: And he now being the la&s;t of his linage, caried
with him into Maluco woorth ten thou&s;and cru&s;adoes,
which he &s;pent not in idlenes, nor yet in play, but onely in
bringing of many kings and innumerable townes vnto
our holy faith, and in the pre&s;eruing of Maluco, employ|ing
all his power and &s;trength that all the cloues might
<PB REF="6">
come vnto the hands of the kings highnes: which with
Maluco yeelded vnto him euery yeere fiue hundred thou|&s;and
cru&s;adoes; being all to his great preiudice, let, and
hinderance. For if he had gathered cloues for him&s;elfe,
as the captaines of Maluco haue done and doe, then he
had come home very rich. But when he came home into
Portugall in great hope (&s;uch is the &s;implicitie of the
be&s;t natures) to be rewarded for his good &s;eruice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good &s;eruice full ill re|warded.</NOTE> and to
be more fauoured and honored, then if he had brought
home with him an hundred thou&s;and cru&s;adoes, he was
greatly deceiued. For he found neither fauour, nor yet ho|nor,
but onely among the poore and mi&s;erable, to wit, in
an ho&s;pitall: where he was kept &s;euenteene yeeres vntill
the hower of his death; and there he had allowed vnto
him his winding &s;heete to burie him in: and the brother|hood
of the Couent prepared for his buriall as for a
poore courtier ca&s;t off by all men, leauing him&s;elfe indeb|ted
in two thou&s;and cru&s;adoes, whereof part came out of
India, and part thereof many of his friends had lent him
to maintaine him in the ho&s;pitall: for in all the&s;e &s;euen|teene
yeeres he had not of his highnes for to helpe him|&s;elfe
with &s;o much as one riall of plate, nor yet I of the
bookes which I deliuered receiued any thing to di&s;charge
his will with. Yet for all this, euen as vpon the pro&s;peritie
of his victories he neuer made any boa&s;t, &s;o likewi&s;e in his
aduer&s;ities his great &s;tomacke did nothing abate his hart.
As there are good proofes that with &s;o many and &s;o con|tinuall
di&s;graces as he &s;uffered, he neuer vnto the hower
of his death left off to rai&s;e and to augment the yeerely
rent vnto a Counto:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Counto is 50000. cru|&s;adoes.</NOTE> which &s;ome made &s;trange and would
not giue eare vnto: So that euen as he was extreme pain|full
in the performance of his &s;eruice, &s;o he was the like
in the things &s;ounding vnto the perfecting of the &s;ame,
which was the cau&s;e that he was brought vnto the &s;tate
that he died in. For he could not &s;ee the qualitie of the
<PB REF="7">
time, but onely tho&s;e of his great &s;eruice, by rea&s;on of the
great charges that it &s;tood him in. And his &s;aying was,
That he was borne, not for to &s;ay that his con&s;tellation
was in the wars victorious, but in the ouercomming of
kings by the arte of warfare, readines in re&s;oluing, pru|dence
in con&s;eruing, and great loialtie and patience with
many &s;eruices vnto his king and ma&s;ter. In which of all
the&s;e he had mo&s;t contentation it cannot ea&s;ily be deter|mined.
Wherefore your noble Grace may &s;ee, that this
treatie and the others were made with &s;ighes and afflicti|ons
which his inferiour will might haue rai&s;ed vp in him
again&s;t his &s;uperiour rea&s;on. Neither was he willing to
take for his remedie that which that great Turke <HI>Zelim</HI>
&s;onne to the great <HI>Mahumet</HI> did, (for he tooke Con&s;tan|tinople
and died in Rome) who v&s;ed to make him&s;elfe
drunke, becau&s;e he would not remember the great e&s;tate
which he lo&s;t: nor yet woulde he giue eare vnto tho&s;e
things which many of his friends would tell him, wi&s;hing
he would &s;ettle his mind out of the kingdome: (for other|wi&s;e
he &s;hould neuer be able to liue:) whereunto he an|&s;wered,
that in this point he would rather be compared
vnto the great <HI>Timocles</HI> the Athenian,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or rather The|mistocles.</NOTE> then to be like the
excellent Romane <HI>Coriolanus.</HI> Which is a goodly exam|ple
of a true and faithfull Portugall. (Though it were not
&s;o as I doe &s;ay, yet I doe heare, that the ho&s;pitals be full of
the mo&s;t faithfull &s;ubiects to their prince and countrey.)
Wherefore by all rea&s;on this treatie ought to be of your
Grace fauoured, &s;etting apart all ouer&s;ights, if there be
any, in this worke, of the author: I being not able to
attaine vnto the vnder&s;tanding of the con|trary.
God pro&s;per your Grace with
long life and increa&s;e of

much maruailed at, becau&s;e from thence it was aboue 300.

it &s;eemed, that they were not naturally borne in that cli|mate,

<P>In the y&eacute;ere 1553. there went out of <HI>England</HI> certaine

there is a wall aboue 200. leagues in length, &s;tanding n&eacute;ere
vnto 50. degr&eacute;es of latitude.</P>
<P>Now I gather by all the precedent di&s;coueries, that the
whole earth is in circuite 360. degr&eacute;es according to the <HI>Geo|metrie</HI>
thereof: and to euery degr&eacute;e the ancient writers al|low
17. leagues &amp; a halfe, which amount vnto 6300. leagues
yet I take it that euerie degr&eacute;e is iu&s;t 17. leagues. How&s;o|euer
it be, all is di&s;couered and &s;ailed from the ea&s;t vnto the
we&s;t almo&s;t euen as the &s;unne compa&s;&s;eth it: but from the
&s;outh to the north there is great difference; for towardes the
north pole there is found di&s;couered no more then 77. or 78.
degr&eacute;es, which come to 1326. leagues: and towards the
&s;outh pole there is di&s;couered from the Equinoctiall to 52.
or 53. degr&eacute;es, that is, to the &s;treit which <HI>Magellan</HI> pa&s;&s;ed
through, which amounteth to about 900. leagues; and put|ting
both the&s;e &s;aide maine &s;ums togither, they amount to
2226. leagues. Now take &s;o many out of 6300. leagues,
there remaineth as yet vndi&s;couered north and &s;outh aboue
the &s;pace of 4000. leagues.</P>
