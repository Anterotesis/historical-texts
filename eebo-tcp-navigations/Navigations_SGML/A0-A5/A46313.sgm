<P>THE famous <HI>Sabellicus, Bembo,</HI> and others, give this account of the Original of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Com|monwealth. In the Year of Chri&s;t, <HI>421.</HI> the Inha|bitants of <HI>Aqulteia</HI> and <HI>Padua,</HI> through dread of the <HI>Hunns,</HI> and finding their own Cities de&s;troy'd, betook them&s;elves to Flight, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the I&s;lands of the <HI>Adri|atic Sea;</HI> and retiring fir&s;t to the upper Shoar, now call'd the <HI>Rialto,</HI> there laid the Foundations of <HI>Venice.</HI> The City it &s;elf is &s;eated in the inmo&s;t rece&s;s of the <HI>Adriatick Bay,</HI> containing almo&s;t Sixty I&s;lands, at a very &s;mall di&s;tance one from another, divided by narrow Eddies running between, with a &s;mall Mount (provided by Provident Nature) defends from the Violence of the Sea. It is &s;tor'd with convenient Rivers, which import all thiugs as well for Delight, as for the Nece&s;&s;ities of Mankind.</P>
<P>The whole City con&s;ists of three Ranks of People, the <HI>Patrici|ans,</HI> or Gentlemen, the Citizens, and Mechanics. The Supream Power of Government, is in the hands of the <HI>Patricians.</HI> It is divided into &s;ix Quarters, containing Seventy two Companies of Common People: One and forty Religious Hou&s;es, Seventeen for Monks, and Twenty four for Nuns. &V;pon the Front that looks toward the Shoar, &s;tand two very vast Pillars, the one bearing the <HI>Winged Lion of St. Mark,</HI> and the other the Statue of St. <HI>Theodorus;</HI> and in the Space between, all Malefactors are Executed. The Cathedral of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> is a most Sumptuous and Magnificent Structure, all of Marble. The Streets are di|vided with &s;mall Channels, or Caneales, joyned together with &s;eve|ral Bridges, part of Wood, and part of Stone, to the Number of <HI>440.</HI> The Ar&s;enal, is a place every way &s;urrounded with strong Walls, wherein Four hundred Workmen are continually em|ploy'd in preparing Materials for the Building of Galleys, and the Reparation of the Bridges, who are every Week paid their Wages to the value of <HI>2000.</HI> Crowns. In a word, <HI>Venice</HI> is the Queen of all the Cities in the World, and which is more, never Subdu'd to Foraign Subjection. This is She, that has for &s;o many Centuries of Years been the Bulwark of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> again&s;t the Power of the <HI>Turks;</HI> being Marry'd to the Sea every Year, by the Cere|mony of throwing a Gold Ring into the Neighbouring Ocean upon
<PB REF="3"><HI>A&s;cen&s;ion-Day.</HI> In a word, &s;uch is the &s;trength of her Situa|tion, &s;uch the Con&s;titution of her Government, &s;uch the &s;trict Ob&s;ervance of her Con&s;titutions, and &s;o exact the Fidelity of her Subjects under an ea&s;ie and gentle <HI>Rule,</HI> that &s;he may well be coun|ted the mo&s;t Renowned City in the &V;niver&s;e.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the Diminution of her Territorys by the lo&s;s of <HI>Candy,</HI> we &s;hall find that Lo&s;s in &s;ome mea&s;ure Repair'd by the Recovery of the <HI>Morea,</HI> to the Extermination (as it may well be hoped) of the <HI>Turks,</HI> from the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and faire&s;t Portion of all <HI>Greece.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Morea,</HI> formerly known by the name of the <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> is a Penin&s;ula, from North to South, an Hundred and fifty Miles in breadth, that is, from <HI>Corinth</HI> to <HI>Cape Macapan,</HI> and a Hundred &s;eventy five from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, and in Circuit Six hun|dred Miles, or thereabout. Formerly it was divided into <HI>Achaia, Arcady,</HI> the <HI>Argives,</HI> the Territories of <HI>Corinth, Elis, Laco|nia, Me&s;&s;enia,</HI> and <HI>Sicyonia.</HI> Now it is divided into the Duke|dom of <HI>Clarentia,</HI> containing <HI>Achaia</HI> properly &s;o called, <HI>Belve|dera,</HI> containing the Territories of the <HI>Me&s;&s;enians,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Elis. Saccania</HI> containing the Country of <HI>Argos;</HI> and <HI>Tzaco|nia,</HI> containing <HI>Laconia</HI> and <HI>Arcady.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Cities of it were <HI>Argos, Argo; Corinth,</HI> now <HI>Corinto; Corone,</HI> or <HI>Coron; Dyme,</HI> now <HI>Clarentia; Elis,</HI> or <HI>Belvedera; Epidaunes,</HI> or <HI>Malva&s;ia; Megalopolis,</HI> or <HI>Leontati; Me&s;&s;ene,</HI> or <HI>Mo&s;&s;eniga, Modon, Nauplia,</HI> now <HI>Na|poli di Romania, Patrae,</HI> or <HI>Patra&s;&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Militra,</HI> formerly <HI>Lacedemon.</HI></P>
<P>This Penin&s;ule is divided from the re&s;t of <HI>Greece</HI> by a narrow Neck of Land, not above Forty Furlongs, or five Miles wide: Which King <HI>Demetrius, Nero, Julius Cae&s;ar, Caligula, Nero,</HI> and &s;ome other Princes, endeavoured to have Cut through, and &s;o to have let in the Sea round about it; but their Labour prov'd in vain, by rea&s;on of the Rockie &s;ub&s;tance of the Earth. How|ever, Succeeding Ages rear'd up a thick Wall in the &s;ame Place, from Sea to Sea, which <HI>Amurath</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> afterward Levell'd with the Ground, when he Conquer'd and Sack'd the <HI>Peloponne&s;us.</HI> It was after that Rebuilt in the Year <HI>1453.</HI> by the <HI>Venetians</HI> in fifteen Days, with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>30000.</HI> Men, but then again utterly Ruin'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> when they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the whole Country.</P>
<P><HI>Patra&s;&s;o,</HI> anciently <HI>Patrae,</HI> from <HI>Patreus,</HI> who Peopl'd it, and
<PB REF="3">Surrounded it with Walls. By the <HI>Romans</HI> it was call'd <HI>Augu&s;ta Aroe Patren&s;is,</HI> and by rea&s;on of its commodious Situation for Commerce, by them much frequented and fill'd with Inhabitants; it is &s;eated about Seven hundred Paces from the Gulph of <HI>Patra&s;&s;o.</HI> In this City <HI>Diana</HI> was formerly Wor&s;hipp'd, under the Name of <HI>Diana Triclariena,</HI> to whom the People made an Annual Sacri|fice of a Young Man and a Virgin, the mo&s;t Beautiful they could find to Expiate the Crime of two Per&s;ons, that were Sacrific'd for Marrying in that Temple without the con&s;ent of their Parents. Here St. <HI>Andrew</HI> the Apo&s;tle &s;uffer'd Martyrdom, as al&s;o <HI>Hero|dian,</HI> who was one of the Seventy Di&s;ciples and Bi&s;hop of this Town.</P>
<P>It is Peopl'd at pre&s;ent for the mo&s;t part with <HI>Jews,</HI> who make it a place of Trade, not only with the Neighbouring I&s;lands, but with the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> However the Air is none of the Whole&s;ome&s;t, by rea&s;on of the High Mountains which overlook it, always cover'd with Snow, and for that the Ground about it is all Mar&s;hie. In the time of the <HI>De&s;potes,</HI> it was a Dutchie; but tho&s;e Princes not finding them&s;elves &s;trong enough to keep it, Sold it in the Year, <HI>1408.</HI> to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> from whom it was taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> in the Year <HI>1463.</HI> In the Year <HI>1533.</HI> it was Be|&s;ieg'd and Taken by <HI>D'Oria,</HI> but the very next Year the <HI>Turks</HI> Retook it again, and held it till this la&s;t &s;uccesful Conque&s;t of the <HI>Venetians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lepanto,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Naupactus,</HI> is &s;eated near the Gulph of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> &s;o Famous for the Battle of <HI>Lepanto,</HI> wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> were Overthrown by the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> with a great Slaugh|ter of Men, and lo&s;s of Ships: It is an Archiepi&s;copal City, built about a Mountain ri&s;ing in the form of a Sugar-Loaf, whereon the Fortre&s;s stands, encompa&s;&s;ed with four large Walls, &s;eparated by Valleys, whereon the Hou&s;es of the Inhabitants stand; the Port is but &s;mall, and might ea&s;ily be &s;ecur'd with a Chain. In the times of Heatheni&s;m, it had four Temples dedicated to <HI>Venus, Nep|tune, E&s;culapius,</HI> and <HI>Diana.</HI> &V;nder the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Turks,</HI> it contain'd &s;even Mo&s;ques, two Churches for the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and three Synagogues for the <HI>Jews.</HI> In the Year <HI>1408. Emanuel,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> put it into the hands of the <HI>Veneti|ans,</HI> not able to defend it him&s;elf. But in the Year <HI>1477.</HI> it was Be&s;ieg'd by the <HI>Turks,</HI> with an Army of <HI>30000.</HI> Men, who after they had Batter'd it for four Months together, were forc'd to rai&s;e their Siege, and leave it under the <HI>Venetian</HI> Government, till the
<PB REF="4">Year <HI>1498. Bajazet</HI> with an Army of <HI>150000</HI> men, forc'd it to a Surrender. However the Arms of St. <HI>Mark</HI> remain'd, till it was now last Regain'd by General <HI>Moro&s;ini.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Corinth,</HI> &s;o call'd from <HI>Corinthus,</HI> the Son of <HI>Pelop</HI>'s, was accounted the mo&s;t Noble and Wealthy City of all <HI>Greece;</HI> and by the means of its Situation, it arriv'd to that degree of Splendor and Pride, as to abu&s;e the Emba&s;&s;adors that were &s;ent by the <HI>Ro|mans;</HI> which the Senate took &s;o hainou&s;ly, that they &s;ent <HI>Mem|mius,</HI> with Orders when he had taken the City, to Level it with the Ground, and to put all the Inhabitants to Sale. <HI>Memmius</HI> ac|cording to his In&s;tructions, &s;et it on Fire; and the mixture of mettals in that di&s;mal Conflagration, produc'd that &s;ort of Bra&s;s, call'd <HI>Corinthian Bra&s;s,</HI> much more e&s;teem'd then Silver or Gold. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> afterwards Rebuilt and Peopl'd it; but it retains nothing of its Pri&s;tin glory, being nothing but a heap of Ruines, &s;erving to harbour a &s;mall number of People. <HI>Amurath</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> and <HI>Maho|met</HI> his Son, made it the Seat of their Barbarous Cruelties, and &s;o Ruin'd it, that there are very few Hou&s;es to be &s;een, and tho&s;e built out of the Ruines of the former Structures. The Fortre&s;s that both Commanded and Secur'd it, was call'd <HI>Acro-Corinth,</HI> &s;eated upon a high and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Rock, furni&s;h'd with Wells of excellent Spring-Water; and among the re&s;t, the Fountain <HI>Pirene,</HI> which was Con&s;ecrated to the Mu&s;es, the Water being very clear, and mo&s;t plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;itra,</HI> was the Ancient <HI>Sparta,</HI> or <HI>Lacedemon,</HI> &s;o famous in Ancient Story, and when in its Splendor, two Leagues in Com|pa&s;s. This City is divided into four Parts, all di&s;tinctly &s;eparated one from the other. This was the Habitation of <HI>Menelaus,</HI> the Husband of <HI>Helena,</HI> who being Ravi&s;h'd away by <HI>Paris,</HI> occa&s;ion'd the Siege and De&s;truction of <HI>Troy.</HI> Here the Laws of <HI>Lycurgus</HI> took place; Con&s;titutions contriv'd with that Wi&s;dom and Policy, that their Ob&s;ervance pre&s;erv'd the Splendor of this City, for the &s;pace of <HI>880</HI> Years. It was taken by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> in the Year <HI>1460.</HI> and <HI>3200.</HI> after its first Foundation.</P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;tel-Nuovo</HI> is the Capital City of the Province of St. <HI>Sobba,</HI> ten days march in Length, and four in Breadth, bounded by <HI>Bo&s;&s;i|na</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia.</HI> It was built by <HI>Tuardus</HI> King of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina,</HI> and is &s;eated upon the Banks of the Canal of <HI>Cattaro,</HI> three miles from the mouth of it, and ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the <HI>Levant Sea,</HI> about <HI>800.</HI> Paces in Compa&s;s. It has two Towers in the We&s;t &s;ide, and one upon the Sea-&s;hoar; but the Walls having been often &s;haken by
<PB REF="4">Earthquakes, are neither very &s;trong, nor yet Terra&s;s'd. The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Salimanega</HI> which joyns to the Town, and is built upon a Rock, is commanded by the Mountain of <HI>Santa Veneranda;</HI> from whence you may likewi&s;e batter the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Te&s;tagick,</HI> which is Terra&s;s'd, and built partly upon a Rock, partly upon a Mount of Earth, and &s;erv'd the <HI>Turks</HI> for ae Magazine of Powder.</P>
<P>The upper Fortre&s;s that goes by the name of <HI>Gornigrade,</HI> is <HI>650</HI> Paces from the City. Northward; one of the Angles &s;tands upon Earth, the other three upon a Rock. The whole Fortre&s;s is not a|bove <HI>250</HI> Paces in Circuit, and might be ea&s;ily ruin'd by a Battery from the Mountain of <HI>Sliebi.</HI> In the Year <HI>1572.</HI> the <HI>Venetians</HI> having lo&s;t it before to <HI>Ariadene Barbaro&s;&s;o,</HI> made an Attempt to recover this Place, under the Conduct of General <HI>Venieri,</HI> but they met with &s;o many Ob&s;tacles, and &s;uch con&s;iderable Oppo&s;ition, that they were forc'd to give over the Enterprize, which they never af|terwards ventur'd any more till this pre&s;ent Year, under the more &s;uccesful Conduct of General <HI>Cornaro.</HI></P>
<P>The on&s;uing Journal is a Pro&s;pect of the la&s;t Summer's Conque&s;ts under the &s;uccesful Banners of the mo&s;t Serene Republick of <HI>Venice.</HI> The particulars of which are from day to day &s;et down, as it may be &s;uppos'd, by the &s;tile of the Original, which is in <HI>Italian,</HI> by &s;ome great Officers, that were Eyewitne&s;&s;es of the Succe&s;s in both Places, and of no &s;mall Credit for the truth of the Relation, as being Al|low'd and Licens'd by <HI>Public Authority.</HI></P>
<P>As for the <HI>Negropont,</HI> which it is thought will be the fir&s;t En|terprize of the next Campaigne, if it be not already taken accord|ing to Report, and the general Expectations, it was anciently call'd <HI>Abantis,</HI> afterwards <HI>Euboea,</HI> from the name of a Matron of Ma&s;|culine Courage that govern'd it. This I&s;land may well be &s;aid to be the Queen of all the I&s;lands in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> as being in length <HI>130</HI> miles, in breadth <HI>30,</HI> and in Circuit <HI>300.</HI> It lies &s;tretch'd all along to the North upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Achaia,</HI> from whence it is divided by a narrow Frith, not above <HI>50</HI> Foot over; the chief City is <HI>Chalcis,</HI> now <HI>Negropont,</HI> joyn'd to the Continent by a Draw-bridg. In &s;o much that &s;ome Geographers believe, it was for|merly a part of the Continent it &s;elf, and only &s;eparated from it by &s;ome Earthquake, to which the I&s;land is &s;ubject &s;ometimes. It was formerly &s;ubject to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to whom it was a&s;&s;ign'd by <HI>Raba|nius Carcerius,</HI> who was Duke of it; but in the Year <HI>1470.</HI> it was &s;ubdu'd by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the <HI>II.</HI> with a great &s;laughter of the Chri&s;tians. It has a very &s;trong Ca&s;tle with four Towers, and a well &s;tor'd Ar&s;enal.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>And thus we &s;ee the haughty Turk run down on every &s;ide, chas'd out of <HI>Hungary,</HI> expell'd the <HI>Morea,</HI> lo&s;ing Ground in <HI>Dal|matia;</HI> and in a word, the Ottoman Empire, according to all human Rea&s;on, ha&s;tning to its period. For there is a Spirit of Conduct, Mag|nanimity and Gallantry, which ranges about the World, and fixes &s;ometimes here, &s;ometimes there, as De&s;tiny de&s;igns to turn the &s;cales of Succe&s;s. And this is the rea&s;on that decaying Empires Langui&s;h under &s;loathful and effeminate Princes. A Critical Sea&s;on which the Prudence and Vigilance of Inferior Dominion always lay hold of, to wre&s;t from the feeble hands of Potentates &s;ubjugated to their plea&s;ures, the wrongful Conque&s;ts of their Ance&s;tors. As if the Spirit and Vi|gor of their Fore-fathers were departed from them to their Enemies. Such a conjuncture as this, now luckily fell out at <HI>Venice,</HI> which was never better &s;tor'd then now, with Per&s;onages not only Illu&s;trious for the antiquity of their De&s;cent, then for their own per&s;onal Vertues.</P>
<P>For of the Name and Family of the <HI>Moro&s;ini</HI> we find in Hi&s;tory, no le&s;s then Three who were Dukes of <HI>Venice.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t was <HI>Dominico Moro&s;ini,</HI> the <HI>37th.</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice,</HI> who clear'd the Gulph of the Cor&s;airs of <HI>Ancona,</HI> among whom <HI>Gui&s;card,</HI> who was the chief, was taken and hanged: He recover'd <HI>Pola,</HI> and <HI>Parenzo,</HI> revolted from the Signorie in <HI>I&s;tria.</HI> He ador|ned <HI>Venice</HI> with Beautiful Structures, and began the Tower of St. <HI>Mark.</HI></P>
<P>Next to him was <HI>Marino Moro&s;ini,</HI> the <HI>44th.</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> in who&s;e time a Colony of Nobility was &s;ent into <HI>Candy,</HI> who Built <HI>Candy.</HI></P>
<P>The third was <HI>Michele Moro&s;ini,</HI> the <HI>61&s;t.</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> a Per&s;on of great Learning and Wi&s;dom; who tho' he lived but a &s;hort while, Enacted &s;everal good Laws for the benefit of the Republic.</P>
<P>The Family of the <HI>Cornari</HI> is likewi&s;e very Ancient, and reckon'd into their Number. <HI>Marco Cornari,</HI> who reduced the Rebellious <HI>Candiots</HI> to their Obedience to the Common Wealth, in the time of <HI>Urban</HI> the <HI>5th.</HI> Of the Family of <HI>Venieri,</HI> was <HI>France&s;co Ve|nieri, 81&s;t.</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> who, tho' the <HI>Turk</HI> at the &s;ame time, made War upon <HI>Puglia,</HI> and the King of <HI>France</HI> in <HI>Florence,</HI> yet entertained the King of <HI>Poland</HI> in <HI>Venice.</HI> And <HI>Seba&s;tian Ve|nieri,</HI> the <HI>86th.</HI> Duke of <HI>Venice;</HI> who was cho&s;en with that unani|mous con&s;ent, that even &s;everal of the <HI>Turks</HI> them&s;elves, came to ki&s;s his Feet.</P>
<P>To Speak more of their Living De&s;cendants is a labour beyond the task of the&s;e few Sheets, which only gives a rough draught of their Great Atchievements, for publick and pre&s;ent Satisfaction; leaving the re&s;t for Histories more Polite and Copious, to render Glorious to Po&s;terity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>From the Venetian Fleet in the Seas of</HI> Lepanto <HI>and</HI> Patra&s;&s;o, July 25. 1687.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER &s;ome little Heats and Conten|tions, which redounded much to the Honor of his Excellency, my Lord Ad|miral, tho' they put &s;ome &s;top to this pre&s;ent Campaign, this Morning with loud Peals of great Guns aboard the whole Fleet, and with mo&s;t Devout Thank&s;givings to the Supreme God of Victory, was &s;o|lemniz'd the appearance of this day &s;o much wi&s;h'd for, which re&s;toring Univer&s;al Prattick to our Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;afeguard to our Seas, has brought us that Joy and Con&s;olation, which it is not po&s;&s;ible for any Per&s;on to comprehend, that does not fo|&s;ter Sentiments of Chri&s;tianity in his Heart. After which,
<PB N="2" REF="7">his Excellency made it his Bu&s;ine&s;s. After which, his Ex|cellency betook him&s;elf, according to the Dictates of his own Religious Zeal, to return to the God of Mercy, the mo&s;t Devout Remon&s;trances of Humiliation, for &s;o mira|culous a Ble&s;&s;ing. So that upon <HI>Sunday,</HI> the 20th. of this In&s;tant Month, being attended by all the Chief Commanders at Sea, and by all the young Patritian Nobility, under a mo&s;t pompous Pavillion he caus'd <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be Sung; and the whole Fleet at the &s;ame time to acknowledge the &s;ig|nal Favours of Heaven, to the Confu&s;ion of our Infidel Ene|mies. Thus after their Excellencies had heard the Holy Ma&s;s, and received the mo&s;t Holy Sacrament, they retired every one to their particular Commands.</P>
<P>This nece&s;&s;ary Chri&s;tian Duty, being thus ended, and a Re&s;olution being taken to carry on the Inva&s;ions towards the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Lepanto</HI> and <HI>Patra&s;&s;o</HI> to compleat the entire Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Morea,</HI> his Excellency fail'd not in the fir&s;t place to furni&s;h him&s;elf with all &s;orts of nece&s;&s;ary Pro|vi&s;ion and Ammunition. He reduc'd the Foot that was to land to about Nine thou&s;and Foot, all &s;ound Men, in &s;epa|rate Bodies according to their Nations, under Officers of Valor and Conduct. With the&s;e he joyn'd a &s;trong Bo|dy of Thirteen hundred Hor&s;e, and had not &s;ickne&s;s very much afflicted the Soldiery, their number would have been much greater.</P>
<P>Having Embark'd all his Forces, he weigh'd and &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Glimeno,</HI> the 20th of <HI>July</HI> in the Evening, with twenty &s;ix Gallies, fourteen Galeots, &s;ix Galea&s;&s;es, Ve&s;&s;els with &s;quare Sails, what with Ships, Fly-boats, Pinks, Brigantines, and Tenders, to the number of Eighty Seven. Which Body was under the Command of Captain <HI>Zaguri.</HI> The Lighter Ve&s;&s;els, by the help of their Oars, made a &s;hift to leave the Greater Ve&s;&s;els behind, tho' they put forth to Sea many hours after the others had &s;et Sail.</P>
<P N="21">21&s;t. Next Morning the Fleet arriv'd within &s;ight of the Ca&s;tles, and <HI>Patra&s;&s;o,</HI> having had a fair Wind, and no le&s;s pro&s;per'd by the Gales of a Cele&s;tial Bene|diction.</P>
<P>Coming neer the Shore, they di&s;cover'd the Enemies Tents pitch'd in great numbers upon a Hill, which over|looks
<PB N="3" REF="7">the Fortre&s;s; and another great Encampment, be|tween the &s;ame Fortre&s;s, and the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Morea,</HI> &s;eated al&s;o in a very advantageous place. Now to obtain &s;ome under&s;tanding of the Enemies de&s;ign, our Ships coa&s;ted along the Shore within Musket &s;hot, at what time we could di&s;cern the Enemy running bu&s;ily to and fro, un|der the protection of a Brea&s;t-work by them erected above a Mile a this and that &s;ide <HI>Patra&s;s,</HI> making a &s;hew of a great number of En&s;igns, and of much Courage and Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>But where the Brea&s;t-work ended, there they gave over appearing; Which being ob&s;erv'd by his Excellency; after he had amus'd 'em for &s;ome time longer with his Gallies, he pa&s;t on to the Shore of <HI>Rumelia,</HI> which he &s;aw likewi&s;e very &s;trongly Guarded with Soldiers, and &s;uch another Brea&s;t|work, and near to the Ca&s;tle was di&s;cover'd another great Encampment.</P>
<P>General <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI> had embark'd him&s;elf aboard the General's Gally, which was therefore &s;o de&s;ired by his Ex|cellency, that he might have the more opportunity to con|fer with him about their manner of Landing.</P>
<P>That, it was fore&s;een, would be difficult if the <HI>Otto|mans,</HI> were re&s;olv'd to hinder them; becau&s;e they might do it &s;afely under the protection of their Works. Being therefore &s;o much as they were a head of the re&s;t of the Fleet, they re&s;olv'd to effect it, in the place before men|tioned, where the Brea&s;t-work ended upon the Right &s;ide of <HI>Patra&s;s,</HI> becau&s;e they could command it with the Prows of their Gallies.</P>
<P N="22">22d. The next Morning therefore the whole Fleet made an attempt to Land, and fir&s;t the Galeots and Gallies them|&s;elves being come to the place fir&s;t pitch'd upon, the Foreigners fir&s;t &s;et foot a&s;hore, who were afterwards fol|lowed by all the re&s;t of the Militia.</P>
<P>The Turks did not appear to oppo&s;e them, for that the Ri&s;ing Ground being pa&s;s'd, the other part being all Mar&s;hie, they thought it not worth their while to make them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it, not knowing where to retire, &s;hould any di&s;a&s;ter befal them. Therefore Marching in &s;ight of our Ve&s;&s;els, they went with a Body of about Three hundred Hor&s;e to attack the Right Wing where were
<PB N="4" REF="8">tho&s;e of <HI>Brun&s;wick,</HI> and the Foreigners; who giving them the Liberty to approach, ply'd them &s;o well with their Musket &s;hot, that the Turks were forced to retire, who being pur&s;u'd by the Foreigners left many of their People dead upon the &s;pot, who&s;e Heads became a prey to our own Men.</P>
<P>By this Time the People in the Galea&s;&s;es di&s;embark'd, and the Ships, and flat bottom'd Ve&s;&s;els being arriv'd, all the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e and Foot landed, Three Miles from the Fortre&s;s; which could not happen &s;ooner, by rea&s;on the Winds happen'd &s;omething contrary. The Turks &s;hew'd them&s;elves in good Order upon the Curtins under the Fortre&s;s, and were intrench'd upon the Shore after that manner, that they took up two Miles in Front, with a Bat|tery of two pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>In the Night, by the favour of the Darkne&s;s, the mo&s;t Excellent <HI>Sanudo,</HI> with a Squadron of Eight &s;lender Gallies, pa&s;s'd within the Ca&s;tles, on purpo&s;e to de&s;troy the Barks, to the end the Turks might be depriv'd of the Opportu|nity of tran&s;porting their Soldiers out of <HI>Grecia</HI> into <HI>Morea.</HI></P>
<P>The 23d. the Galea&s;&s;es, and one Pinnace got within Musket &s;hot of the Face of the Battery, and in le&s;s than Three Hours with their prow-Cannons beat it down, and in many places ruin'd their Trenches, and with another Pinnace that &s;hot Stones, drave the Turks quite from their po&s;t.</P>
<P>The 24th. this Morning which was St. <HI>Chri&s;tins</HI> day, be|ginning their March again by Break of Day, in regard they had a long way to go, they March'd but &s;lowly, and keeping an exact Order, at what time General <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI> &s;hew'd his great Knowledge in Military Di&s;cipline. The Enemy abandoning their Brea&s;t-work upon the Coa&s;t, and leaving their Tents, began their Approaches nearer and nearer to our Army, making a &s;hew of great Re&s;olution, but &s;oon after turn'd their backs, as if they intended to flee. But the more uncertain their Motions were, &s;o much the le&s;s did we alter our March, yet with an Ardent de&s;ire, however, to come to handy &s;trokes.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>At length, after eighteen hours thus &s;pent, the Barba|rians approached, and began to Skirmi&s;h with a Batalian of the <HI>Oltramarine's,</HI> Commanded by Colonel <HI>Ceclina;</HI> at what time our Forces embodying, and the Enemy approaching with all their Forces, the Sign of Battel was given, and the Chri&s;tian Army prepar'd them&s;el&s;es for the &s;o long ex|perienc'd Tryal of their Valour.</P>
<P>The Turks fir'd very thick with their Muskets upon the <HI>Oltramarines</HI> which were upon the Right Wing, and with their Swords in their hands, made a bold Attaque upon their Rear.</P>
<P>But then the Oltramarines being bravely flank'd by the Fri&s;ian Hor&s;e of the Left Wing, ply'd their Small-&s;hot &s;o nimbly, that the Enemy &s;lacken'd their Fury, and were re|puls'd with great lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Quitting therefore this Attaque, they made another A&s;|&s;ault upon the Brun&s;wickers in Flank, where intending to have broken in with their Swords in their hands, they met with &s;uch a &s;olid and vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, that being well mortify'd with the well order'd Volleys of the Muskets, and &s;eeing many of their Men fall dead upon the place, after a clo&s;e Fight of four hours, maintain'd by our Men, who upon all occa&s;ions were &s;till &s;uccour'd by the Sclavonians and the Cavalry, they betook them&s;elves to an ignominious flight, being valiantly pur&s;u'd by the Oltramarines, and by the Marque&s;s <HI>Corbon,</HI> with his Cavalry. However, General <HI>Co|ning&s;mark</HI> would not &s;uffer ours to pur&s;ue the Enemy very far, for fear of falling into any Embu&s;cado, and becau&s;e he would not that the Army &s;hould break their Order. So that the Turks making ha&s;te to their Tents, pull'd up the greate&s;t part, at what time they in the Piazza of <HI>Patra&s;s</HI> &s;etting fire to a Magazine of Amunition, joyn'd with the re&s;t, and leaving in a moment all that compa&s;s of Ground in our Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, they all di&s;appear'd. In this Fight, &s;ingular was the Conrage and Experienc'd Conduct of General <HI>Coning&s;|mark;</HI> and the valorous Arm of the Prince of <HI>Turrena</HI> did great Execution, who being joyned with the Marque&s;s <HI>Cor|bon,</HI> lead the Hor&s;e: Nor did the Prince of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> le&s;s generou&s;ly behave him&s;elf, who with his Troops was &s;till in the hotte&s;t of the Action. The Death of Colonel <HI>Ceclina,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9">&s;hot in the Brea&s;t with a Musket-Bullet, is univerfally la|mented; who being by Nation an Oltramarine, tho' he had lo&s;t his Chief Commander, under&s;tood &s;o well with &s;o much vigor, to humble the furious Pride of the Mu&s;elmen. Of whom there were Five hundred &s;lain upon the place, and 'tis believ'd a great many more were kill'd, in regard of the great number of Tents that were left for want of Owners.</P>
<P>We took five Pieces of Artilery, be&s;ides two Pieces of Cannon, which were found planted upon the &s;hore within their Trenches, when at the beginning of the Fight the Ge|neral order'd the Volunteers to land, on purpo&s;e to divert the Enemy. On the other Side we had little lo&s;s, in regard we kept the Enemy at a di&s;tance with our Muskets. It added al&s;o to their greater fear, for that the General in the heat of the Fight, had cau&s;ed a great number of the Seamen to land, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the Trench afore&s;aid, found therein the two fore-mentioned Bra&s;s Pieces, and two others at a little di&s;tance from thence, which form'd the Battery already &s;poken of; be&s;ides which, the Enemy left behind them &s;ix Field-Pieces which they lo&s;t in the Conflict. Great was the number of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Colours, which the Chri|&s;tians brought away as Trophies of their Valor, and that which added to the Glory of their Triumph, was, their taking of three En&s;igns with Tayles, be&s;ides a very rich Standard guilded; with which the Fringe and Blazon were evident Signs of the Ba&s;ha-General&s;hip; of which the Se|ra&s;quier is depriv'd. His Flight, together with that of the Army, was immediately followed by the Flight of their other Party at <HI>Rumelia,</HI> and the abandoning their Tents. And the Night after, his Excellency under&s;tanding that the Turks had left the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Morea,</HI> he turn'd the Prows of his Galleys, and he no &s;ooner came in &s;ight of the place, but he &s;aw &s;ome part of the Wall toward the Sea, on <HI>Greece</HI> &s;ide, blown up by Gun-Powder, and the Ca&s;tle left under the Dominion of the Venetians, with forty Pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>The General for all this, would not &s;uffer his wonted heat, for the Good of his Country and Chri&s;tendem, to cool, but held on his Voyage for <HI>Lepanto,</HI> to make the ad|vantage of his good Fortune during this Con&s;ternation of the
<PB N="7" REF="9">Turk: And indeed the Favour of Heaven pro&s;per'd his zea|lous De&s;igns, for the Barbarians being &s;till more and more &s;eiz'd with <HI>Panick</HI>-Terror, could not endure the &s;ight of our Ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that &s;eeking their &s;afety in other places, they retreated, and left to the Victorious Venetians the Piazza it&s;elf. And thus, to the great wonder of every one, this mo&s;t Signal Victory was obtained through the Favor of the God of Ho&s;ts, with the mo&s;t Glorious Conque&s;t of four Fortre&s;&s;es in the turning round of one Sun: By which the Public gain'd One hundred and &s;ixty Pieces of Cannon almo&s;t all Bra&s;s, be&s;ides a great quantity of Provi&s;ions and Warlike Amunition, together with fourteen Pyrate Barks. So that the mo&s;t Serene Republic now Commands a mo&s;t Delicious, Fertile and Spacious Gulph, a Spacious and Rich Country, to the incredible Contempt and Lo&s;s of the Per&s;ecutors of the Holy Religion and the Chri&s;tian Faith. <HI>Carlo Pi&s;ani,</HI> Captain of the condemn'd Per&s;ons, is al&s;o de&s;igned by His Excellency, to take all the Turki&s;h Ve&s;&s;els which he can find in the va&s;t Gulph of <HI>Lepanto.</HI> So that after &s;uch ma|ture and timely Provi&s;ions, we have no rea&s;on but to pro|mi&s;e our&s;elves from the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, for the future, Progre&s;&s;es of mo&s;t Remarkable Con&s;equence for the Honor of the Chri&s;tian Armies, and the greater advantage of our Invincible Republic.</P>

<HEAD><HI>From the Fleet, in the Bay of</HI> Corinth, Augu&s;t 17. 1687.</HEAD>
<P>SO glorious was the Fame of the Valour of the Venetian Armies upon the Overthrow given to the Sera&s;quier in the late Battel, in the Campains of <HI>Patra&s;s,</HI> and by the gain|ing of <HI>Patra&s;s, Lepanto,</HI> and two Ca&s;tles be&s;ides, that the Turks, now taught by the fortunate Succe&s;s of the Chri&s;tians, are &s;ufficiently convinc'd, that Fortune, which for &s;o long time has favour'd the Ottoman Armies, to the great Oppre&s;|&s;ion of the Chri&s;tians, has now for&s;ak'n their Side. After the&s;e glorious Acqui&s;ts, we under&s;tand, that <HI>Kamor,</HI> Ba&s;ha of <HI>Avaruti,</HI> and <HI>Gavar,</HI> Ba&s;ha of <HI>Vallona,</HI> both fell under the Valor of the Venetian Victors, being the Per&s;ons who were order'd to guard the Shore of the Continent from this Place to the <HI>Preve&s;a;</HI> and that of an Hundred and twenty Colours which they had, to every one of which belong'd fifty Men, that only three remain'd &s;afe, the re&s;t were all de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>They reck'n lo&s;t of the Ottoman Side, about a thou&s;and &s;lain outright, and above as many more wounded, which dy'd in the ha&s;ty flight which the Sera&s;quier made to <HI>Corinth.</HI> For the greater Proof of which, there are many Carca&s;&s;es to be &s;een upon the Road. Be&s;ides a great many which are al&s;o found in the Country Hou&s;es by our Adventurers, who range the Country to make Slaves of both Sexes, who averr that the Enemy were about Twelve thou&s;and, being recruit|ed but a little before with Three thou&s;and Soldiers from <HI>Ne|gropont.

<P>How great the fear of the Sera&s;quier was, may be ea&s;ily conjectur'd, by his cau&s;ing part of the Hou&s;es of the Fortre&s;s to be burnt, &s;o &s;oon as he came to <HI>Corinth:</HI> Which Fortre&s;s &s;tands upon the top of an Hill, three Miles and more di&s;tant from the Sea.

<P>Upon our approach to the Great Bay of <HI>Corinth,</HI> there were &s;ome Hor&s;es &s;till to be &s;een, and the Fire was &s;till burn|ing which the Ba&s;&s;a had &s;et to the Hou&s;es.

<P>It was thought fit to &s;end back the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;els to the Ca|&s;tle of the <HI>Morea,</HI> and while they were con&s;idering what other Important Actions to go upon, they did not forbear to mind one thing of Principal Moment, which was to take a &s;trict view of the Streight, and of the Place it&s;elf, as well in or|der to nece&s;&s;ary Deliberations, as to find out a way to pre|vent the Return, if they &s;hould attempt it, of the Turks

<P>Now while it was believ'd that <HI>Mahomet</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, with his Forces above-mentioned, was not as yet departed the King|dom, there was &s;ome a&s;&s;urance that laying hold of the Con|juncture while the Pa&s;s was free, he had made the more ha&s;te to get out of <HI>Rumelia,</HI> and retire to <HI>Thebes,</HI> where the Se|ra&s;quier had his abode, with tho&s;e Forces which he could retain in their Obedience.

<P>As to the di&s;po&s;al of the Churches, made choice of in every one of the Places, conquer'd by the mo&s;t Serene Republic, they are the faire&s;t of the Mo&s;chees, of which there are a very great number.</P>
<P>In <HI>Patra&s;&s;o,</HI> within the Fortre&s;s the <HI>Mo&s;chee</HI> was given to the Franci&s;can Fryers of the Order of the mo&s;t holy Concep|tion, and the Provincial <HI>Buonanome</HI> has the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. And in the, City was given another with the Title of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> to the Barefoot Carmelite Fryers.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lepanto</HI> the faire&s;t Mo&s;chee was Con&s;ecrated by the Name of St. <HI>James,</HI> and the Solemnity was performed pre|&s;ently after the gaining of the City. In the Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Morea</HI> another was dedicated to our Lady of Health or Sal|vation, and a Prie&s;t was placed therein. In the Ca&s;tle o&s; <HI>Torne&s;e,</HI> another was dedicated to our Lady of <HI>Loretto;</HI> and St. <HI>Anthony</HI> of <HI>Padoua.</HI> But there was no Chaplain ap|pointed,
<PB N="13" REF="12">nor any Di&s;po&s;al then made at <HI>Corinth.</HI> The two Ships, the St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Factor of Zant,</HI> Ma&s;ter <HI>Anzolo Michiel,</HI> are return'd from <HI>Napoli</HI> in <HI>Romania,</HI> which in the time of the Sickne&s;s there, were &s;ent thither to rein|force that Important City; but there being no need of any Reinforcement, they have return'd the Three hundred Foot which were aboard, tho' they have not prattic allow'd them as yet, becau&s;e tho&s;e parts are &s;till &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>The Captain Ba&s;&s;a, with his Fleet, &s;uffer'd heavily while his Fleet was infected with the &s;ame Di&s;temper, &s;o that he was forc'd to re-enter the <HI>Dardanels</HI> to recruit his Ve&s;&s;els almo&s;t empty of Men. <HI>Scio</HI> and <HI>Senirna</HI> are infected with the &s;ame Di&s;temper, but the I&s;lands of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Lemnos</HI> are free.</P>
<P>The Metropolitan of <HI>Corinth,</HI> which is a Dignity of great Honor, came to vi&s;it the Captain General, with a large Train of Prie&s;ts of his own Religion; and was re|ceived with the &s;ame Demon&s;trations of Affection, as the Addre&s;&s;es of &s;o worthy a Prelate were humble and con|de&s;cending, and becoming a Per&s;on &s;o greatly e&s;teem'd both in the&s;e and other parts.</P>
<P>And indeed, new Subjects come in every day to do Ho|mage to his Excellency; and to obtain po&s;itive Orders not to be mole&s;ted by the Soldiers or Seamen, to the end they may undi&s;turb'd enjoy tho&s;e Felicities, which they have &s;o long wi&s;h'd for in being freed from the &s;lavery of the Barba|rians.</P>
<P><HI>Mi&s;itra</HI> &s;till remains to re&s;emble the Ancient <HI>Sparta,</HI> rich in Gold and Merchandi&s;e, and peopl'd with Twelve thou&s;and Souls. His Excellency has &s;ent thither the Proveditor of <HI>Zar|nata Palani,</HI> with Six thou&s;and <HI>Mainotts,</HI> and other Country Men, to compel it to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by a Siege.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t fight of the Be&s;iegers brought the Affrighted Enemy to &s;o much complacency, that they hung out a White Flag, and after Ho&s;tages given on both &s;ides, they went &s;o far as to re&s;ign three principal Members of this Place, to the Supreme Authority of his Excellency, with Letters from their Ba&s;&s;a, that they were ready to abandon the whole Territory, provided they might have pa&s;&s;age for them&s;elves,
<PB N="14" REF="13">their Families, and their Baggage. But in regard they had held out to the la&s;t ga&s;pings of the whole Kingdom, and thereby had forfeited Compa&s;&s;ion, he deny'd their Propo|&s;itions; only he was content, to let the Women, Children, and Aged Per&s;ons to go; but as for them, they &s;hould remain Slaves, with this Liberty to redeem them&s;elves at the price of Two hundred thou&s;and <HI>Reals;</HI> leaving them upon refu&s;al of both the&s;e Propo&s;als, to &s;hut them&s;elves up within their Walls, from whence it would be afterwards his part to ex|pel them by force of Arms.</P>
<P>The three Commi&s;&s;ioners being thus &s;ent back with the General's An&s;wer, we are in expectation of the Re&s;olution of the Citizens.</P>
<P>Upon the 13th.

<HEAD><HI>From the Venetian Fleet, under</HI> Ca&s;tle Novo <HI>in</HI> Dalmatia, September 16. 1687.</HEAD>
<P>THis mo&s;t Serene Republic, makes it her Bu&s;ine&s;s to mind the Security and Pro&s;perity of all Chri&s;tendom, and the Holy League, having generou&s;ly re&s;olv'd to purge the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea of that pe&s;tilent Rabble of <HI>Cor&s;aires</HI> of <HI>Ca|&s;tel Novo,</HI> and other adjacent Places, which with their Barks and Pyracies they render impa&s;&s;ible, and all the Neighbour|ing Coa&s;ts un&s;ecure for Trade. To which purpo&s;e, at the va&s;t expence of her own Trea&s;ures, &s;he has rais'd a &s;trong Army in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> under the Command of his Excellency <HI>Girolamo Cornaro:</HI> For that tho&s;e Places being attack'd and reduc'd, which &s;erve as a Sanctuary and Security to tho&s;e Enemies of the Chri&s;tian Name, the Triumphant Standard of the Cro&s;s will be gloriou&s;ly advanc'd by the zealous Valour of the Venetian. Thereupon an Enterprize &s;o im|portant being concluded upon, it was agreed that the Enemy &s;hould be attack'd where-ever he &s;hould be found. Nor was the Sieur <HI>Janco</HI> &s;econd to any, a Per&s;on of great Courage, and much dreaded by the Turks; who &s;etting out of <HI>Spalatro</HI> in company of his Morlacks, and under&s;tanding that in the Plains of <HI>Dunno,</HI> beyond <HI>Cettina,</HI> about Three hundred Turks were got together, went re&s;olutely to fight them; and the Fray being begun, having him&s;elf with his Cutlace laid a Turk &s;prawling upon the ground, believ'd him dead: but the other having a Pi&s;tol in his hand, let fly at the Victor and &s;hot him. However, there were kill'd and taken fifty of the Turks by the <HI>Morlacks,</HI> with the lo&s;s of only two Men; all their Tents and Baggage were al&s;o taken.</P>
<P>His Excellency therefore being re&s;olv'd upon his in|tended De&s;ign, took &s;hipping with his whole Army, and after contrary Winds which kept our Fleet thirteen days
<PB N="17" REF="14">at Sea, not without &s;ome detriment to the Hor&s;e for want of Water and Forrage, our Fleet arriv'd with a propitious Wind, the &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> within the Ro&s;es over again&s;t <HI>Ca&s;tle Novo,</HI> which to the number of a hundred and thirty, or more Sail, made &s;uch a Maje&s;tic &s;hew of it &s;elf, which con&s;ider'd together with the Courage of tho&s;e abroad, &s;trook no ordinary Terror into the Turks: Which was by them made the more manife&s;t, for that they let us &s;ile off our Men within Cannon &s;hot, without &s;o much as firing one Gun at us.</P>
<P>The next day about Six a Clock, our Army landed not above two Miles from the Fortre&s;s, and then advancing &s;lowly in good Order toward the &s;ame Fortre&s;s, and about a Mile from the &s;ame, they found &s;ome Oppo&s;ition from the Turks, who being got to the top of a little Hill, and po&s;ted in a Church, call'd by the name of <HI>Santa Veneranda,</HI> occa&s;ion'd a bloody Skirmi&s;h. Pre&s;ently the General di&s;|patch'd away Orders to the Auxiliaries, to advance with the Gallies within Cannon &s;hot, and to bring their Guns to bear upon the Enemy, by that means to di&s;loge them, and to ha&s;ten their own landing, to reinforce our Men. At the &s;ame In&s;tant, the General mounting a Hor&s;eback with all the Cavalry, con&s;i&s;ting of Four hundred able &s;tout Sol|diers commanded by the mo&s;t Illu&s;trious <HI>Giovanni Loredano,</HI> appointed by his Excellency Proveditor of the Cavalry in the Camp, and ordering the Oltramarine Militia to land, threw him&s;elf per&s;onally together with them, into the Place of the Conflict, which la&s;ted for two hours with great ob&s;tinacy on the Turks &s;ide. But at length the Auxilaries being landed under the protection of the continual firing of the great Guns from the Gallies; and our new Reinforce|ments being di&s;cern'd by the Turks, who &s;urrounded his Excellency in very good Order, the Enemy retir'd toward the place continually skirmi&s;hing, and firing upon our Men; who having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of the mo&s;t advantageous Po&s;ts of the &s;aid Church, the Marque&s;s of <HI>Borro,</HI> Serjeant Major of Battalia, went in the Night time to take a view of an advantageous Po&s;t, in a Hou&s;e within Cannon &s;hot of the lower City: where our <HI>Banditti</HI> of <HI>Abruzzo</HI> being po&s;t|ed, and our paid Foot being entrench'd a little behind to|gether
<PB N="18" REF="15">with the Auxiliaries, his Excellency commanded two of our Gallies, commanded by <HI>Ludovic Balbi,</HI> and <HI>Benetto Zorzi Querini</HI> to take two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els grappl'd together, and bring them within &s;hot of the City, which was done not without great difficulty, by rea&s;on of the continual firing of the Enemy, tho to no purpo&s;e. The &s;ame day Eighty Men were kill'd of the Enemy, together with three Aga's, which was told us by a Slave that was taken Pri&s;oner. And of ours five or &s;ix were &s;lain, among whom a Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> and &s;ome few common Soldiers, with two Knights of <HI>Malta</HI> wounded.</P>
<P>The fourth day upon opening the Trenches to advance our Works, our Men found ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance from the Turks, who having &s;trengthen'd them&s;elves in another Hou&s;e, and entrench'd them&s;elves within half Pi&s;tol &s;hot of our people, there happen'd all that day continual firing on both &s;ides, not without &s;ome lo&s;s of blood, be&s;ides, that the great Guns continually plaid upon our Battalians, and did us &s;ome mi&s;chief. However, the Pinnaces fail'd not to play continually upon the low City with their Bombs, to the con&s;iderable damage of the Enemy.</P>
<P>The Fifth day his Excellency ob&s;erving the Re&s;olution of the Turks, who vigorou&s;ly maintain'd their Po&s;t in the fore&s;aid Hou&s;e, re&s;olv'd to bring two Sacres to di&s;lodge the Enemy from that Po&s;t. For the Execution of which de&s;ign the Guns arriv'd about the 21&s;t. hour, at what time they were mounted, and began their Battery upon the &s;aid Hou&s;e, which did not a little &s;care the Enemy; who having never|thele&s;s &s;ecur'd them&s;elves with new Trenches, as al&s;o the advantage of a continual Rain and Wind on their &s;ide, tho&s;e advantages not only hinder'd the battering the Hou&s;e, but very much endamag'd our Men, who while they endeavour to keep their Muskets dry, were them&s;elves almo&s;t drown'd in the Rain, which fell &s;o exce&s;&s;ive that Night, that it was impo&s;|&s;ible to &s;hrow'd their Arms.</P>
<P>The Fifth day, tho' it continu'd rainy Weather, yet acts of Ho&s;tility did not cea&s;e for all that, for their was conti|nual firing of Small-&s;hot on both &s;ides, and continual &s;hoot|ing, as well from the upper Town, as the Ca&s;tle with their Cannon, but &s;o ineffectual to us, that we receiv'd little or
<PB N="19" REF="15">no damage, tho' the Turks were tormented by the Bombs of our &s;mall Frigats, which the Sieur <HI>Pietro Duodo,</HI> having by Order of his Excellency brought within an ea&s;ie reach of the Town, very much incommoded the Town by the per|petual firing their Bombs, to the number of five hundred, among which there was one that brought to the ground a part of one of their Mo&s;chees, and another fell into one of their great Towers over again&s;t the upper Ca&s;tle, while they landed their Cannon and Mortar Pieces to perfect their Battery.</P>
<P>Upon the 6th. day, the Turks made a &s;hift to advance to our Battery of the two Sacres, which were valiantly de|fended by our Dragoons in the Po&s;t, advanc'd by the <HI>Brandi Stocchi</HI> of our Soldiers, upon which day the number was &s;mall either of &s;lain or wounded.</P>
<P>The 8th. day, being the Fe&s;tival of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, was de&s;ign'd by his Excellency to land more Men upon the We&s;t &s;ide, to the end there might be a Communication between our Men, and to prevent the like between tho&s;e that were be&s;ieg'd in the upper Fortre&s;s and the lower. For the Execution of which, the Auxiliary Gallies were commanded by their continual firing to &s;ecure our landing, at what time our four Gallies, with the Militia aboard them, with &s;everal &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els grappl'd together, ad|vanc'd to the We&s;t &s;ide, the Proveditor General leading the way with his Feluque. The fir&s;t that landed were Fif|teen hundred Dragoons, who were plac'd in the Van, on purpo&s;e to take any advantageous Po&s;ts, who found certain Hou&s;es for &s;helter near the City, to the &s;uccour of whom his Excellency &s;ent a good number of the paid Soldiers of the Galeots, as al&s;o a con&s;iderable number of the <HI>Morlacks</HI> of <HI>Spalato,</HI> and <HI>Chi&s;&s;a.</HI> At length the Turks &s;ecur'd from the frequent Peals, as well of our Auxiliary Gallies, as our own, his Excellency in per&s;on cau&s;ing two Battalions of Infantry to land, the Turks retir'd, leaving the Hou&s;es of the City expos'd to Plunder, which con&s;i&s;ted of &s;ome &s;mall quantity of powder'd Fle&s;h, the Truks having carry'd away all the re&s;t into the Fortre&s;s. At the &s;ame time the <HI>Malte&s;i</HI> and <HI>Papalines,</HI> who that day guarded the Po&s;t upon the We&s;t &s;ide, where the Turks were fortifi'd in a certain Hou&s;e,
<PB N="20" REF="16">from whence they had not a little perplex'd our Men, having got over the Trenches with Drums beating, advanc'd to|ward the Turks, who di&s;may'd to &s;ee the Courage of the A&s;&s;ailants, ba&s;ely quitted their Po&s;ts, which was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Malte&s;i,</HI> who not &s;o content, trar&s;ported by their Courage, attempted to make their way into the City, in the hurly burly and confu&s;ion of the Turks, that throng'd into it. Which fell out unfortunately, for that near the City, they met with a numerous Embu&s;cado, where five Hor&s;emen were &s;lain, who&s;e Heads the Turks cut off, and took away their upper red Coats, with the white Cro&s;s upon their Brea&s;ts, and about twenty more were wounded, be&s;ides a good number of their Foot kill'd, as &s;ome report &s;ixty, as others &s;eventy.</P>
<P>In the mean time our <HI>Pera&s;tines</HI> crept down from a little Hillock to the Cavalier of the Fortre&s;s, and advanc'd to another Po&s;t within Musket &s;hot of the &s;ame Forts, in hopes to have cut the Embu&s;cado in pieces, which had &s;o en|damag'd our Auxiliaries, but the misfortunes of the Rain, which cau&s;ed great overflowings of Water at that time, would not permit them to make any other attempts, while our Men had all their Fire Arms all over much wet. Only they made a &s;hift to lodge them&s;elves within Musket &s;hot of the City, the <HI>Pera&s;tines</HI> entrenching them&s;elves near the upper Ca&s;tle, and the <HI>Malte&s;i</HI> retreating in good Order to the Po&s;t, fir&s;t taken from the Turks.</P>
<P>The 9th. day his Excellency de&s;ign'd to go in per&s;on to re|view the Po&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Pera&s;tines,</HI> as al&s;o that which com|manded the upper Ca&s;tle, and riding a Hor&s;eback to that part; the Turks who ob&s;erv'd it, to &s;hew their Courage, Sally'd out of the Ca&s;tle, to the number of Four hundred, and at|tempted to recover the Po&s;t which the <HI>Malte&s;i</HI> had gain'd the day before, and then defended by the Marque&s;s of <HI>Boro,</HI> Ser|jeant Major of <HI>Battalia:</HI> But they were receiv'd by ours with hail of Musket &s;hot, &s;o that being beaten back, they at|tempted to win the Po&s;t which was kept by the <HI>Pera&s;tines.</HI> To which purpo&s;e with large, Poles in their hands, they advanc'd toward their Trenches: Upon their fir&s;t Charge the <HI>Pera&s;tines</HI> were a little di&s;order'd; but being encouraged by the pre&s;ence of his Excellency, who imme|diately
<PB N="21" REF="16">&s;ending a good Body of the &s;aid Militia to their A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, they forc'd the Enemy to retreat. Our &s;mall Frigates al&s;o pur&s;u'd their firing into the City and the Lower Ca&s;tle, with wonderful Effects. That day there was but little Rain, but the &s;ame night following it fell with an un&s;peakable violence.</P>
<P>The Tenth day, his Excellency caus'd two great Cannons of Fifty pound Bullets to be mounted, which, together with two more of Twenty pound, were to batter the Lower For|tre&s;s, but the Rain was &s;o violent that there was no playing of them: However, they were mounted, and upon the Eleventh, at Night, they play'd upon the lower Ca&s;tle from the We&s;t. By this means His Excellency thought to pro|cure a Parley; to which purpo&s;e he &s;ent the Sieur <HI>Doliza Dicattaro,</HI> well known to them, who approaching the City in a Feluque, he was an&s;wer'd in Musket-language, tho' without any hurt done to any that were in the Felnque.</P>
<P>On the Eleventh, we began to play upon the Enemy with our Battery, and it was our good Fortune with two &s;hot of a Cannon of Fifty pound Bullet to light into their Platform, to the con&s;iderable damage of the Enemy. The Enemy made good their Defence with extraordinary Courage, more e&s;pecially expecting to be reliev'd by the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Azugouina,</HI> who was approaching to their &s;uccour with Four thou&s;and Men; and at this In&s;tant, we are preparing to march forth to meet him and give him Battel; to which purpo&s;e His Ex|cellency al&s;o goes in Per&s;on, and it is hop'd that our Courage will be &s;uch as to beat the Enemy.</P>
<P>Toward the Evening of the Eleventh Day, an Old Wo|man was taken Pri&s;oner, whom the Turks made u&s;e of to &s;end to the Ba&s;&s;a. There was found about her under one of her Brea&s;ts, a Letter, wherein the Be&s;ieged earne&s;tly be|&s;ought the Ba&s;&s;a's Relief.</P>
<P>Upon the Twelfth, Letters were brought to His Excel|lency from a Confident, which &s;et forth the weak Condition of the Ba&s;&s;a, who was not able to mu&s;ter together above Eight hundred Turks: Which is the more probable, becau&s;e it comes from a Per&s;on of Credit: and a Con&s;ident of the Ba&s;&s;a's. There are &s;ome that report him not above Four thou&s;and of all that he can &s;crape together. However,
<PB N="22" REF="17">His Excellency is re&s;olv'd to meet him, tho' 'tis &s;uppos'd the Ba&s;&s;a will not advance forward.

The Turks have this day made many &s;hot to di&s;mount our Battery, but with no &s;uc|ce&s;s. At this In&s;tant His Excellency is gone to the advanc'd Po&s;t, to review our Batteries.</P>

In the Night-time about Seventy Chri&s;tians, Men, Women and Children, that were in the Upper Fortre&s;s, render'd them&s;elves, who related that they were very much pe&s;ter'd by the Carka&s;&s;es of the Turks, who lay &s;lain in their way, to the number of a hundred, &s;lain in the Skirmi&s;hes of the former days: That an hundred and thirty lay wounded in the Ca&s;tle, and about forty &s;ick, that the wounded peri&s;h'd for want of skilful Men to look after them: That the Beigh, or Principal Commander, was &s;lain upon the Eight day by the <HI>Malte&s;i:</HI> That the Governor of the Upper Fortre&s;s lay very ill; and that if that day the Rain had not fallen &s;o violently, but that our Men in the pur&s;uit of the Enemy had enter'd the City, the Turks, di&s;|may'd with the I&s;iue of the Conflict, would certainly have left the Gates open in the Con&s;ternation of their flight; be|&s;ides, that the Conduit being broken, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="23" REF="17">have been forc'd to a Surrender for want of Water, had not the Rain fallen.</P>
<P>The &s;ame-Day, His Excellency &s;ent for a Mortar-piece from the We&s;t &s;ide, in regard the Bombi&s;ts &s;ent from <HI>Ve|nice</HI> were bu&s;ied in rai&s;ing of a New Battery.</P>
<P>This Day appear'd two Deputies from the Common|wealth of <HI>Ragu&s;a;</HI> the one to Congratulate His Excellency for the News of the Conque&s;t of <HI>Morea,</HI> the other was &s;ent to the General of <HI>Malta</HI> upon the &s;ame account.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth we fini&s;hed our We&s;t and Ea&s;t Lines, and joyn'd them together; as for the Turks, they &s;hut them&s;elves up in the City, and there &s;tood upon their De|fence.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Day two Turks were made Slaves, &s;ent from the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Archigouina</HI> with Circulatory Letters to the Ter|ritories and Villages adjoyning, with Orders to rai&s;e Forces within their Limits; but not a Man was rais'd, under pre|tence that they had no Men fit for Service.</P>
<P>After Dinner, came to the Camp &s;ome of the Principal of Mount <HI>Ni&s;ita,</HI> in the Sclavonian language, Mount <HI>Ninick;</HI> where lye &s;everal &s;mall Territories confining upon Mount <HI>Negrini,</HI> of the Greek Church. They &s;urrender'd them&s;elves wholly to the di&s;po&s;al of the Serene Republic, with all their Coun|try, two days di&s;tant. They left Ten Ho&s;tages, and the Chief Heads were rewarded with a Donative of an Hun|dred <HI>Checkines.</HI> They reported that a Turk that was woun|ded in the la&s;t Battel of <HI>Hungary,</HI> was by the Prime Vi&s;ier Ele|cted Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Archigouina,</HI> who rambles up and down pick|ing up what Fugitives he can find, to &s;uccour this Place; but the Subjects of <HI>Ni&s;ita</HI> were re&s;olv'd openly to declare for the Republic of <HI>Venice.</HI> To which purpo&s;e they had re|que&s;ted a Standard; upon which one was given them, they promi&s;ing within three or four days &s;uch a &s;ufficient Number, as &s;hould be able to hinder the Pa&s;&s;age of the Enemy. For which His Excellency promis'd an Exhibition of a Thou|&s;and <HI>Checkines,</HI> every time they &s;hould rout the Enemy's Forces. In the Night, two Pieces, Fifty Pounders, were de&s;ir'd for the Battery again&s;t the Roundels, in the mid&s;t of the City.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="18">
<P>The Fourteenth, two Mortar-Pieces were brought from the We&s;t, and a Cannon-&s;hot fell into a <HI>Palander,</HI> and wounded two Men, and another fell into the General's <HI>Caick,</HI> while it was rowing a Mortar-Piece a-&s;hore, and hurt two of the Rowers. The Turks toward the Sea &s;ent forth &s;eve|ral Women to fetch Water, which could not be prevented by our Men, by rea&s;on of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance which the Enemy gave the Women. At the &s;ame time a Turk flew up in the Air, being to&s;s'd up by the breaking of a Bomb. The &s;ame day, Advice came, that the Ba&s;&s;a's of <HI>Arcigouiana</HI> and <HI>Albania</HI> were within four hours March of our Army, with a con&s;iderable number of Turks and Chri&s;tians; &s;o that we &s;tood all the time to our Arms: The Pa&s;&s;es were re-inforced with other Companies, and with an Hundred and Twenty <HI>Zupponi</HI> that came in the mean time under three Banners; and from tho&s;e Fortifications were flung about Six hundred Bombs.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth, came Letters to His Excellency from <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> that the Turks were at a &s;mall di&s;tance off, and that the next Morning they would Attack the Trenches. There|upon His Excellellency review'd the Po&s;ts; the Batteries were advanc'd to the City, and the half of the Roundels Defence was beat down by the Cannon, being almo&s;t laid level, notwith&s;tanding the Walls were two Cubits thick.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time two Men of War were brought from the Ea&s;t part to play upon the Enemy, if they attempted to pa&s;s that way: And for the &s;ame rea&s;on the Auxilaries were brought and planted upon the We&s;t &s;ide, where our Men had thrown up a Counter-Line. Be&s;ides that, they cut down &s;everal little Groves, under the Protection of which they might be &s;ecurely a&s;&s;ail'd by the Turks.</P>
<P>Toward the Eighteenth hour, the Turks appear'd, who came to relieve the Place, &s;o &s;oon as they had forc'd their way through the &s;treight Pa&s;&s;es which were guarded by our Men; who in&s;tead of making that re&s;i&s;tance which they ought to have done, abandon'd their Station at the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Enemy, and retir'd to certain Valleys. The Turks at the &s;ame time made long &s;trides towards our Lines upon the We&s;t, of which the Count of <HI>Mutia,</HI> Serjeant Ma|jor of Battalia, being advis'd, pre&s;ently got his Companies in order.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="18">
<P>And as &s;oon the Turks with great Fury and loud Cries inve&s;ted our Trenches; which prov'd much to their Advan|tage, while the Squadron on the Town-&s;ide being terrify'd, without &s;o much as di&s;charging a Musket, began to fly amain. So did the Squadron of Colonel <HI>Perini,</HI> being di&s;|order'd by the flight of the fir&s;t; &s;o that the Enemy made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of our Works, which they began to ruin. But the Count of <HI>Mutia</HI> pre&s;ently di&s;patch'd Colonel <HI>Adel|man</HI> with a Squadron of Dragoons, and another of Grana|deers, and re&s;tor'd the Battel. In flew al&s;o Colonel <HI>Conti,</HI> with his Men, encourag'd by the Squadron of <HI>Carpone&s;e,</HI> which, without &s;taying for Command, broke in, to the great advantage of the Combat.</P>
<P>The Turks thereupon, try'd with a ha&s;ty March, and no longer able to make re&s;i&s;tance, after a long Fight, turn'd their backs, and betook them&s;elves to flight. The pur&s;uit was attended with a great &s;laughter, and they who had let them pa&s;s by before, ob&s;erving the Rout, fell upon their flanks; &s;o that the <HI>Perini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Montenegrini</HI> much encrea&s;ed the Havock.</P>
<P>His Excellency rode to the Place of the Conflict, to animate his Men, and to be ready with Relief upon all occa&s;ions; nor would he &s;tir, till &s;everal Heads and Colours were brought him, with certain Advice of the Victory.</P>
<P>There were above Three hundred Heads to be &s;een, be|&s;ides many &s;lain upon the Place; Twelve Colours, and Twelve Slaves, of which one was of <HI>Ca&s;tle-Novo,</HI> who had got out of the Town to &s;olicit the Relief; a Principal Per&s;on of <HI>Scutari,</HI> very Rich, and one <HI>Cozzo</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>His Excellency &s;hew'd the Signals of his Conque&s;t to tho&s;e of the Upper Fortre&s;s, who might well ob&s;erve the Fight, expo&s;ing to their view the Heads that were cut off, the Co|lours, and part of the Slaves, and gave the Be&s;ieged to un|der&s;tand, that &s;eeing they had no hope of Relief, there Army being routed; and con&s;idering the &s;treightne&s;s of their own Condition, they ought to &s;ubmit to the Victorious Arms of the Republick, and &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">cea&s;e all future fruitle&s;s Ob&s;tinacy: But the Defendants cutting off all long Preambles, made An&s;wer, It was not yet time, and at the &s;ame In&s;tant di|&s;charg'd a Volley of Musket-&s;hot.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="19">
<P>From the Slaves they under&s;tood, that the depos'd Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Archigouina</HI> was Elected Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina;</HI> that he who had exchang'd with him, had only Ten Per&s;ons in his Train; that the Remainder, part Chri&s;tians, part Turks, amounted not to above Four thou&s;and at mo&s;t; that they both came with a Body of Two thou&s;and &s;everally; and that the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Aroigouina</HI> was the Per&s;on that inve&s;ted our Men, the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina</HI> &s;taying behind; and that the Government of <HI>Ra|gu&s;a</HI> had accommodated the&s;e Commanders both with Provi|&s;ions and Money.</P>
<P>But notwith&s;tanding Night came on, the Turks were pur|&s;u'd by the Militia, among whom the <HI>Sclavonians</HI> &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves, who &s;erv'd in the Galleys, the Burghers of <HI>Spala|tro, Sebenico</HI> and <HI>Trau,</HI> who were the fir&s;t that leap'd out of the Redoubts with their. Swords in their hands again&s;t the Enemy.</P>
<P>Upon this Victory, which co&s;t little Chri&s;tian Blood, de|pended the Conque&s;t of this Place. So that</P>
<P>In the Evening, all the Guns in the Fleet were &s;hot off in Token of Victory, and a Squadron of <HI>Morlacks</HI> was &s;ent to re-inforce the advanc'd Po&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth, His Excellency caus'd <HI>Te Deum</HI> to be &s;ung, as a return of Thanks to Heaven; while the Enemy turning their backs, retreated a whole days March from the&s;e Parts. Eight Slaves were al&s;o brought in, of which one was the Brother of a Captain of a <HI>Dolcignota</HI> Galley, and a Colonel of <HI>Ma&s;ter;</HI> al&s;o two Heads, the one of the <HI>Giambeck</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina,</HI> who Commanded a Thou&s;and Per&s;ons; the other of a Cap|tain of <HI>Retino.</HI></P>
<P>Among the other Heads before-mentioned, that of the Brother of the Slave of <HI>Scutary</HI> came to be known. The &s;ame day, two of the Cannons which were in the Upper Battery, were remov'd into the Lower, and another Battery was built of two Pieces of Fifty; &s;o that the Place was play'd upon with a Battery of Ten Pieces.</P>
<P>Soon after, His Excellency expos'd the Heads and Stan|dards a &s;econd time, and made a &s;econd Summons; but was An&s;wer'd, That &s;o long as the Red Standards were di|&s;play'd upon the Walls, it would be a Sign of Ho&s;tility;
<PB N="27" REF="19">That it was not a Time for Treaties, and that God would a&s;&s;i&s;t the Defendants.</P>
<P>That day the Batteries beat down altogether the Defence of the Roundel, and they rai&s;ed Bonnets and Lines to &s;ur|round the Fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>A Bomb falling upon &s;ome pieces of Timber and Mate|rials of Earth, reduc'd all to A&s;hes. Our Militia al&s;o on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, by the benefit of the Night, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them|&s;elves of a Hou&s;e near to the Ca&s;tle, being a fit place to form a Shelter for Miners. The <HI>Malte&s;i</HI> al&s;o having got ground, threw up a Line of Circumvallation to &s;urround the Ca&s;tle, and as they were making a great round Platform, the Turks &s;ally'd out to hinder them, but were beaten back.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth, a Battery was fini&s;h'd of one great Gun of Fifty, and a Cannon of Twenty, and two Mortar|pieces of Five hundred on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and began to play upon the Curtin of the City near the Roundel, which open'd a Breach in the &s;olid Wall, but not low enough.</P>
<P>About the middle of the day was brought a Colours, and the Head of one <HI>Deli,</HI> a Per&s;on of Quality, cut off by one of the Chief of the <HI>Pera&s;tines</HI> who guarded the advanc'd Po&s;ts; and he that was the Me&s;&s;enger &s;aid, that the Enemy was very much &s;hatter'd in their flight; that many of our People were at their heels, cutting of tho&s;e that lagg'd behind and thought to hide them&s;elves. Another Slave &s;aid, That the Enemy were above Four thou&s;and, mo&s;t Men that were forc'd from Provinces afar off; and that the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina,</HI> with Two hundred Hor&s;e only, remain'd to &s;hew his back to his own People. That he was over-rul'd to attack our Men by the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Arcigouina,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that with Two hundred Hor&s;e enter'd our Trenches, and that in his flight the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Bo&s;&s;ina</HI> was flightly wounded. No more then Eight hundred of our Men enter'd the Battel, and di&s;|pers'd &s;o great a Party of the Turks, with the lo&s;s of only Four of ours, and Five and twenty wounded.</P>
<P>After Dinner, the Be&s;ieged &s;et up Gabions, and pali|zado'd the Ba&s;tion and Roundel, and gave &s;ome di&s;turbance to tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Battery. But our Men turning two Cannon upon them, the Shot fell among the Gabions,
<PB N="28" REF="20">turn'd them top&s;ie-turvy. and made a great &s;laughter of the Turks. After that, four Mantelets were &s;et up in places agreed upon, which &s;erv'd for Defence of the Miners, who wrought underneath. All night it Rain'd, and the Turks made a great Salley, in hopes to &s;urprize our Men; and it might have fallen out luckily for them, for our Men began to fly in di&s;order, and made loud Cries: But that, in&s;tead of encouraging the Enemy, rather daunted them; &s;o that be|lieving they &s;hould meet with a numerous Oppo&s;ition, they retreated without any more to do.</P>
<P>The Eighteenth, the Enemy mounted two Falconets, the one upon the Great Tower toward the Sea, the other upon the Ca&s;tle of the City; which very much prejudic'd the Camp. But one of our Bombs reveng'd us; for lighting upon a Barrel of Gun-Powder in the Upper Fortre&s;s, it did great damage, be&s;ides the killing of twenty Per&s;ons, Men and Women.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, we had Advice, that the Ba&s;&s;a's before|mention'd, upon a Mu&s;ter of their Men, found mi&s;&s;ing Six hundred thirty five, among which were between Fifteen and Twenty five Per&s;ons of Note, for the mo&s;t part Officers, who&s;e heads were known by the Slaves. Moreover the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Albania</HI> goes about picking up Soldiers as the other two did, not &s;paring Per&s;ons exempt, to encrea&s;e his Number, and try the Fortune of another Combat, re&s;olv'd to do their utmo&s;t to relieve the Place, which they believe to be reduc'd to the la&s;t Extremity.</P>
<P>Late there came a Bombi&s;t, &s;ent by the mo&s;t Serene Duke of <HI>Tu&s;cany;</HI> whereupon Orders were given to get ready new Mortar-pieces. At Night the Turks with a numerous Sally gave us an Alarum, but were valiantly repell'd.</P>
<P>The Nineteenth, a Per&s;on of the Greek Church being &s;topp'd who had been abroad the night before, reported, That the Defendants, &s;eeing the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Fifteenth Day, believ'd it to be a De&s;ign concerted among our For|ces, not being able to conceive that &s;o great a Power &s;hould be &s;o ea&s;ily routed; but being afterwards certify'd of the Truth of the Fact, they were very much di&s;heartned; yet they remain'd ob&s;tinate in their own Defence, and had
<PB N="29" REF="20">made a Circle of Palizadoes, Beams and Faggots round about the Breach.</P>
<P>There were found three Turki&s;h Colours more in the hands of the <HI>Pera&s;tines,</HI> and a Slave of Quality and Honor, <HI>Ali Bei.</HI> Of ours in the Campaigne between kill'd, wound|ed and &s;ick, there are about &s;ix hundred.

<P>They kill'd &s;everal Soldiers, and among others wounded a Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI> who dy'd the next day.</P>
<P>Our Men made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of divers little Hou&s;es adjoyning to the City, &s;till more and more uniting their Lines, &s;triving al&s;o to hinder the Communication between the upper Fortre&s;s and the City; which they continually plaid upon with their Batteries, and infe&s;ted with their Bombs; no le&s;s diligent in ha&s;tening their Mine, tho' that Night they could not do much, by rea&s;on of the abundance of Rain that fell.</P>
<P>The 20th. the Florentine Forces arriv'd, Soldiers pick'd and call'd out of the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Livorn,</HI> commanded by Signor <HI>Cancelli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">i,</HI> to the number of Three hundred.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o about the &s;ame time taken young Lads that belong'd to the City, who reported, that the Turks la|bour'd continually to fortifie the Breach, and that they de|&s;ign'd to ca&s;t up two Pieces of Fortification, that &s;hould with|&s;tand all A&s;&s;aults. Whereupon all the Artillery was brought to

<P N="21">21&s;t. They made Ladders to &s;torm the City in &s;eve|ral places, and weakned the Defence of the Be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>A report al&s;o ran that <HI>Soliman Sangiac</HI> of <HI>Scutari</HI> was get|ing Forces together, to relieve <HI>Ca&s;tle Novo.</HI> Whereupon his Excellency de&s;ign'd to &s;end &s;everal Ve&s;&s;els and Men of War, under the Command of Signor <HI>Duodo,</HI> toward <HI>Dnlcigna,</HI> a City greatly belov'd by the <HI>Sangiac,</HI> on purpo&s;e to divert him; but the Time would not permit him.</P>
<P>Thereupon they pro&s;ecuted their Mining with more indu&s;try then before, to the end they might come at the Foundations of the City, thereby to enlarge the Breach to|ward the City.</P>
<P>The 22d. was &s;pent in expediting the Men of War, and other Ve&s;&s;els toward <HI>Dulcigna,</HI> but the Rains, and contrary Weather would not &s;uffer their departure.</P>
<P>But then the Rumour increa&s;ing of the Turks drawing together to relieve the City, they &s;et them&s;elves to rai&s;e o|ther Works, and to fini&s;h &s;ome Bonnets.</P>
<P>At which time there arriv'd other German Foot, un|der the Command of Colonel <HI>Baracter,</HI> to the number of five hundred in all.</P>
<P>The 23th. they went on fini&s;hing their Works, and bring|ing their Mines to perfection; not cea&s;ing to thunder from their Batteries, which were continually vi&s;ited by his Ex|cellency, and his Lieutenant General.</P>

<P>The 25th. a Mine was &s;et to work under the upper Tower, to the end it might fall together with the City: But the &s;uc|ce&s;s was bad by rea&s;on of the Oppo&s;ition of the Enemy, and the Engineer <HI>Baerbieri</HI> was wounded in the Head with a Stone; but the Mine toward the City advanc'd to the very &s;ides of the Wall.</P>

<P>About the &s;ame time, the Enemy made a &s;ally unexpected|ly, and A&s;&s;ailing our nearne&s;t Trenches, cut off the Heads of two of our Men, and carry'd away another.</P>
<P>The 26th. the <HI>Pera&s;tines</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters to|ward the North, of the Turks Magazines, which they made u&s;e of in&s;tead of an Ar&s;enal, &s;eiz'd upon two Barks that were there, and a Mortar-peice.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day they &s;et the Mines to work at the For|tre&s;s, labouring more &s;ecurely under the protection of <HI>Mantclets;</HI> but to no effect, for that the Enemy di|&s;turb'd the Workmen with Granado's, and continually throwing down Stones, the Ingineer <HI>Carnuto</HI> being wound|ed fir&s;t in the hand with a Fuzee, and afterward in the Foot.</P>
<P>While thus nothing of Military Diligence and labour was neglected, his Excellency re&s;olv'd to try what Policy would do, and con&s;idering there were great Divi&s;ions in the Town, between the Inhabitants, and the Garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of many <HI>Albane&s;e</HI>'s;</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Albane&s;e</HI>'s therefore, the General de&s;ign'd to per|&s;wade to leave the Town, by the means of the <HI>Pera&s;tines,</HI> on purpo&s;e to weaken the Enemies Garri&s;ons, and force them to a Surrender, when they &s;hould find them&s;elves abandon'd by &s;o con&s;iderable a part of their Defendants.</P>
<P>Upon this, two of the Turki&s;h <HI>Albane&s;i</HI> were by the <HI>Pe|ra&s;tines</HI> towld forth, upon the General's Parol, that they &s;hould receive no injury, who being treated with all civi|lity, engag'd the re&s;t to depart the Garri&s;on the next Night, to the number of two hundred and twenty.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> the mean time, all diligence was us'd to advance the Mine, but meeting with nothing but Free-&s;tone, the work went on but &s;lowly.</P>
<P>The Turks, however, endeavoured to Countermine it, upon intelligence given them by the Fugitives, but meeting the &s;ame Oppo&s;ition of Free-&s;tone, all their indu&s;try was in vain.</P>
<P>Now it was agreed with the <HI>Albane&s;i,</HI> that they &s;hould go forth at the great Tower, which looks toward the Sea; whereupon his Excellency imbarking three hundred &s;elect Foot upon two Gallies, the <HI>Brazzana,</HI> and the <HI>Ache&s;ana,</HI>

<P>But 'twas impo&s;&s;ible for him to bring the <HI>Albane&s;i</HI> to that. For tho' they were willing to leave the City them&s;elves, un|der pretence that they were deny'd their Pay, they could not be brought to forfeit their Allegiance to the Grand Sig|nor, by betraying the Place to his Enemies.</P>
<P>Having therefore proceeded &s;o luckily thus far, and the Breaches being &s;ufficiently widen'd, his Excellency re&s;olv'd upon a General A&s;&s;ault, &s;eeing he could &s;o &s;uddenly bring his Mine to perfection.</P>
<P>The 28th. it was agreed upon, that the A&s;&s;ault &s;hould be delay'd, by rea&s;on of the ill weather, and the continual Rains that fell like a Deluge.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day a Florentine Bombi&s;t let fly a Bomb into the Great Tower of <HI>Kernegh</HI> next the Sea Shore, which lighting upon &s;everal Barrels of Powder, &s;ent a great number of Turks into the Air with their Wives and Children.</P>

<P>His Excellency therefore con&s;idering, that the Ca&s;tle was fortifi'd, and which was more, fortifi'd by Nature withal, as being &s;eated upon a high Rock, which it would require a long time to level, the following Articles were agreed upon.</P>

<P>The number of the Enemies, which were in the &s;aid Ca|&s;tle, amounted to near four hundred, what with Old Men, Wounded, and tho&s;e that were able to bear Arms, a Peo|ple fierce and warlike, be&s;ides about a thou&s;and Women and Children.</P>
<P>The Fir&s;t of <HI>October,</HI> the Turks which were in the upper Fortre&s;s, mov'd with the Indulgent u&s;age &s;hew'd their Friends, made an Agreement upon the &s;ame Conditions, and had their departure &s;o, and with the &s;ame Formalities; to the number of about a thou&s;and five hundred Men, Women and Children.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="27">of &s;everal Princes. <HI>Sylla,</HI> after a long Siege made him|&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, and reduced it under the power of the Ro|mans.</P>
<P><HI>Bajazet</HI> triumph'd over it, when it was in &s;ubjection to <HI>Ari&s;tonicus</HI> the <HI>Epicurean</HI> Philo&s;opher. After that, <HI>Renizer Acciajali</HI> was Lord of it, from whom the Venetians won it; but afterwards recovered by the &s;ame <HI>Acciajoli,</HI> who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time <HI>Attica</HI> and <HI>Boeotia.</HI> In the Year One Thou&s;and Four Hundred Fifty five, <HI>Dlahome</HI> II. be&s;ieged it, and &s;ack'd it for want of Relief: Since which time 'till now, it remained all along in the Power of the Ottoman Emperors.</P>
<P>The News of the great Victory was brought upon the the Tenth of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> by a Feluque, which before &s;he came within ken, they knew not what the &s;ight might mean; but when they &s;aw the Ottoman Colours and Standards ex|po&s;ed to view, the People crouded to the Sea-&s;ide with &s;houts of Victory, and immediately the News &s;preading with the &s;wiftne&s;s of the Wind, pre&s;ently a humming noi&s;e of Joy ran through all the Streets, while the People gathered in clu&s;ters gave ear to the Speaker, who undertook to give a relation of the Victory, before he knew it him&s;elf. By and by the loud Acclamations of <HI>Long live St.</HI> Mark, filled all the neigh|bouring Skie, while the Bells with their brazen Throats pro|claim'd the joyful tidings to places more remote; and the Ve&s;&s;els in, Harbour di&s;charging their great Guns, with their glad&s;om terror diffus'd a plea&s;ing Satisfaction into the hearts of the Faithful.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night the Mo&s;t Serene Republick ordered Bon|fires to be made upon the <HI>Piazza,</HI> accompany'd with &s;everal Volleys and Peals of &s;mall and great Shot for two Evenings together; at both which times was to be &s;een the Great Steeple, re&s;embling the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Babylon,</HI> with her Head and Shoulders &s;tuck with Lights, re&s;embling an Immen&s;e Atlas, bearing upon his bunchy Back another Heaven, adorned with Stars propitious to the de&s;ires of the People.</P>
<P>In the Ducal Church was Sung <HI>Te Deum,</HI> accompany'd with Mu&s;ic &s;o charming, that it was a difficult thing to judge, whe|ther Paradi&s;e did not congratulate us for the advantages of &s;o great a Victory.</P>
<P>And to &s;hew that this Serene Republic never &s;uffers Great Actions to go unrewarded, nor Valour to be deprived of its
<PB N="44" REF="28">due Recompence. No &s;ooner did the welcom News of &s;o ma|ny Noble Atchievments reach the Ears of our Senators, to|gether with the Names of the Commanders and Volunteers, who had been &s;harers in an Action &s;o renowned, but they vo|ted a Statue to be erected to the Admiral General <HI>Franci&s;co Moro&s;ini,</HI> in the Council Chamber of <HI>Ten,</HI> with an In&s;cription in Letters of Gold.</P>
<P>To General <HI>Coning&s;mark,</HI> they ordered his Imployment to be continued for Five Years longer, with a con&s;iderable ad|dition to his Pen&s;ion, which is at this time above Twenty Four Thou&s;and Ducats a Year.</P>
<P>To the Prince of <HI>Brum&s;wick</HI> was &s;ent a fair, large and rich Diamond, of a con&s;iderable value. A Sword encha&s;ed with Diamonds was &s;ent to the Prince of <HI>Turena.</HI> And acknow|ledgment was made to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Corbous,</HI> by augment|ing his annual Pen&s;ion, and declaring him Serjeant Major of <HI>Battalia.</HI></P>
<P>Medals of Gold were al&s;o ordered to &s;everal Officers, who &s;ignaliz'd their Valour in &s;o important and famous an Enter|prize.</P>
<P>And for a Conclu&s;ion, give me leave to in&s;ert a &s;hort <HI>Pa|negyric</HI> Pre&s;ented to General <HI>Coning&s;mark,</HI> by Signior <HI>Antonio Martinelli;</HI> thus in Engli&s;h;</P>
<P><HI>To the Mo&s;t Illu&s;trious, and Mo&s;t Excellent Lord, Ge|neral</HI> Coning&s;mark: <HI>&V;pon the Rout of the Sera&s;quier, and the Conque&s;t of</HI> Patra&s;&s;o, <HI>and the</HI> Dardanel <HI>of the</HI> MOREA.</P>
