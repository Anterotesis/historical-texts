for &s;uch as Entend to

Thro the Province of

<P>_AS they that confine them|&s;elves

have not the oppor|tunitie
to &s;ee and ob&s;erve
Rarities in other parts of the
world: &s;o &s;uch as goe into forrain

<P>I Confe&s;&s;e all Travellers are not
<PB N="2" REF="6">
of alike Temper: Some delight
them&s;elves in contemplation of the
curio&s;ities of <HI>Arts,</HI> &s;om are taken

to entertain the reader with tho&s;e
objects and rarities of forain parts,
his <HI>Genius</HI> and inclination is mo&s;t
affected with.</P>
<P>As to my &s;elf, although during
the &s;pace of 16 yeaves travel, I
might have inlarged, according to
the curio&s;itie and opportunitie I have
had in the rehear&s;al of many rare
and exqui&s;ite things verie ob&s;erva|ble:
yet my chiefe aime was to make
&s;uch remarks, as might mo&s;t con|tribute
to the common good of hu|mane
<PB N="3" REF="6">
&s;ociety and Civil life, in taking
notice of the <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>poli|tie</HI>
of the &s;everal <HI>States</HI> and <HI>Domi|nions</HI>
where I have been, viz. The
<HI>&V;nited Provinces, Germany, Den|mark,
Sweden,</HI> and other coun|tries,
who&s;e natural temper and
di&s;po&s;ition &s;eemed to me mo&s;t to
&s;ympathi&s;e with our <HI>English nation,</HI>
and thereby have an occa&s;ion to do
&s;ome good to my own countrie.
Expect not <HI>Reader</HI> alike punctualnes,
as to all the forementioned places,
becau&s;e verie many things which I
might have ob&s;erved, are much
agreeing, and &s;o may be referred,
to what &s;hal be &s;poken of the <HI>Poli|tie</HI>
and <HI>Goverment</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI>
which, for rea&s;ons I &s;hal by and by
hint at, is the Chie&s;e End I aimed
at in this treati&s;e.</P>
<P>We wil begin then in the fir&s;t
place with the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> of
<HI>Holland,</HI> and Dominions of the
<HI>States General</HI> which for &s;ome yeares
hath bin in a declining condition,
<PB N="4" REF="7">
and their forces exceedingly wea|kned,
by rea&s;on of that fatal war
it managed again&s;t <HI>England, France</HI>
and the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> unto
which if we ad the Inte&s;time divi&s;ions
of tho&s;e two factions, the Prince
of <HI>Orange</HI> and <HI>Love&s;tein,</HI> that <HI>Po|litick
body</HI> was &s;o tottered and torn,
as did threaten its utter and total
ruine.</P>
<P>But as bodies whither <HI>natural</HI> or
<HI>Politick,</HI> after that a violent fit hath
&s;ore &s;haken, di&s;&s;ipated and exhau|&s;ted
their &s;pirits, may recover vigor
and look-lively again, if &s;o be the
radical con&s;titution and natural tem|per
be not wholie changed and
depraved: even &s;o This <HI>Common|wealth</HI>
of <HI>Holland</HI> hath vi&s;ibly reco|vered
&s;trength again, and probaly
may attain to its former <HI>force</HI> and
<HI>Lu&s;tre,</HI> except &s;om depravation in its
vital humous &s;hould &s;til keep it
langui&s;hing, and ob&s;truct its per|fect
cure.</P>
<P>We wil therefore make &s;ome re|marks
<PB N="5" REF="7">
as to the defects and faylings
(ob&s;erved not onely by me but al&s;o
by others) which that famous <HI>Com|monwealth</HI>
hath of late yeares bin
guiltie of: which I &s;hal doe not out
of any malice or di&s;igne of reflection,
the intention of writing this treati&s;e
being &s;implie to in&s;ert tho&s;e de|faults,
which the wi&s;e&s;t of Authors
have alwayes Judged nece&s;&s;arie not
onely for the reformation of this,
but of all <HI>&s;tates</HI> what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This <HI>Commonwealth</HI> of <HI>Holland</HI>
hath worthily bin the wonder of all
Europe during this la&s;t age, and
perhaps not to be paralled in the re|cords
of former tymes: for if we con|&s;ider
how many yeares it was a&s;&s;aul|ted
by the then mo&s;t <HI>Potent Prince</HI>
of <HI>Europe,</HI> who a&s;pired to no les then
the <HI>&V;niver&s;al Empire,</HI> and that how
formidable &s;oever he were, yet they
not onely maintained their preten|&s;ions,
but with uninterrupted pro|&s;peritie
and &s;uccesfulne&s;&s;e advan|ced
their trade, and &s;pread their
<PB N="6" REF="8">
conque&s;ts in all the foure parts of the
world.</P>
<P><HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf though mo&s;t famous
and victorious, yet could not, as
is believed, in &s;o &s;hort a time do,
what by this <HI>Commonwealth</HI> hath
bin effected. In <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Affrica</HI>
they &s;oon forced the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and
<HI>Portuge&s;es</HI> to yeeld to them mo&s;t of
their trade and po&s;e&s;&s;ions. And tho
<HI>England</HI> put in for a &s;hare, yet they
were a long while vigourou&s;ly op|po&s;ed
by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and to this
hour have enough to do, to keep
what they have gotten: &s;o that in
le&s;&s;e then an hundred years this <HI>Com|monwealth</HI>
by their indu&s;trie and art
in trading, are becom &s;o exce&s;&s;ive
rich and potent that they began to in|&s;ult
and would needs be Arbitraters
to their neighbouring <HI>Princes</HI> and
<HI>States,</HI> and encroach upon their
<HI>Territories</HI> and <HI>Dominions.</HI></P>
<P>This drew upon them that fatal
war before mentioned, by which they
were &s;orely weakned and brought
<PB N="7" REF="8">
&s;o low, that except God by a more
then ordinarie <HI>Providence</HI> had pro|tected
and appeared for them, they
had certainly bin ruinated and never
able to recover them&s;elves again,
however their pride hereby was much
abated: And as Luxurie and la&s;civi|ou&s;nes
are the &s;ad effects of pro&s;pe|ritie,
as wel as Pride, &s;o &s;uch vices
in a <HI>bodie Politick</HI> and Common|wealth,
as do corrupt the radical hu|mors,
by abating the vigour of the
Vital parts, doe in&s;en&s;iblie tend
to the con&s;umption and decay of the
whole.</P>
<P>That this Commonwealth hath
much recovered its &s;trength, may
clearly appeare, if we con&s;ider what
great things they have effected, &s;ince
the little time they have enjoyed
peace: They have in le&s;&s;e then 7 yeares
built about 40 gallant &s;hips of war;
They have laid out va&s;t &s;ums of trea|&s;ure
in refortifying <HI>Narden, Ma|&s;tricht,
Breda,</HI> the <HI>Grave</HI> and ma|ny
other places: They have payd
<PB N="8" REF="9">
va&s;t &s;ums of money to their Allies
for their auxiliarie troopes, as al&s;o
200000 pound &s;terling to the King
of England to Enjoy their peace
with him. And be&s;ides all this
their Encrea&s;e in Riches and power
may be gue&s;t at, by the many &s;tate|ly
hou&s;es built within the&s;e 5 years
in Am&s;terdam, Rotterdam and
other places; to all which we may
ad, to what exce&s;&s;ive hight the <HI>A|ctions</HI>
of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indie</HI>
Companie are ri&s;en, and the obli|gations
from the Sates are &s;o e&s;tee|med
as to &s;ecuritie, that they Can
get as much money as they plea&s;e
at 2 <HI>Per cent:</HI> not to &s;peak, of the
Exceeding encrea&s;e of their &s;ubjects,
occa&s;ioned by the <HI>French Kings</HI> ty|rannie
again&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Prote|&s;tants</HI>
in <HI>France, Al&s;ace</HI> and other
parts of his <HI>Conque&s;ts,</HI> neither wil
we &s;peak of other &s;ignes of the
encrea&s;e of this <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> as
not Judging it convenient to commit
them to paper, but wil now pro|ceed
<PB N="9" REF="9">
to &s;hew the Method of Living
and travelling in the Dominions and
places of the <HI>States,</HI> which if you do
wel con&s;ider you May &s;ee, how hap|pie
and ea&s;ie the <HI>Government</HI> of <HI>En|gland</HI>
is, above that of other Na|tions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brill</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> is the U&s;ual
place where the <HI>Packet</HI> and Kings
<HI>plea&s;ure boats</HI> bring on &s;uch as come
for to &s;ee the United Provinces:
here be &s;ure to furni&s;h your &s;elf wel
with money. From hence you take a
boat to <HI>Ma&s;eland Sluce</HI> or <HI>Rotter|dam,</HI>
which if you goe in Compa|nie
with others, wil only co&s;t you
5 &s;tivers: but if you take one for
your &s;elf, wil co&s;t 25. &s;tivers for
<HI>Ma&s;eland Sluce,</HI> and a <HI>Ducaton</HI> to
<HI>Rotterdam.</HI> The Fifth part of which
goes to the <HI>States</HI> for a tax, they call
<HI>Pa&s;&s;agie Gelt:</HI> and the other 4 parts
are for the boat Men or Shippers,
who al&s;o out of their gaines mu&s;t Pay
a <HI>tax</HI> to the <HI>States,</HI> &s;o that by com|putation
you pay a fift pennie to the
<PB N="10" REF="10">
<HI>States</HI> for your travelling either in
boats by water, or in waggons by
land.</P>
<P>As you pa&s;&s;e by <HI>Ma&s;eland Sluce</HI>
you'l &s;ee a verie faire fi&s;hing village,
to which belong near two hundred
<HI>Herring Bui&s;&s;es,</HI> but if you goe by
the way of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> you &s;ail by
two old Townes Called <HI>Flardin</HI> and
<HI>Schiedam:</HI> yet let me advi&s;e you be|fore
you depart from the <HI>Bril,</HI> to
take a &s;erious view of it, as beeing
the citie which in <HI>Queen Eli&s;abeths</HI>
time was one of the <HI>Cautionarie
Townes</HI> pawned to <HI>England.</HI> The
<HI>Brill</HI> had a voyce among the <HI>States,</HI>
but by rea&s;on <HI>Rotterdam</HI> hath got
away their Trade, by which having
lo&s;t its former lu&s;tre, is now become
afi&s;hing town onely.</P>
<P><HI>Rotterdam</HI> is the &s;econd Citie
for trade in <HI>Holland</HI> and by &s;ome is
caled <HI>little London,</HI> as having va&s;t
traffick with <HI>England,</HI> in &s;o much
that many of the citi&s;ens &s;peak good
Engli&s;h. There are in this citie two
<PB N="11" REF="10">
con&s;iderable Churches of Engli&s;h
and Scotch: and how great a
trade they drive with the <HI>King</HI> of
<HI>Englands</HI> &s;ubjects is evident, for
in the yeare 1674 at the opening of
the waters after a great fro&s;t, there
departed out of <HI>Rotterdam</HI> 300 Sail
of Engle&s;h, Scotch and Iri&s;h Ships
at once with an Ea&s;terly wind: And
if a rea&s;on &s;hould be demanded how
it coms to pa&s;&s;e, that &s;o many En|gli&s;h
Ships &s;hould frequently com
to that haven? It is ea&s;ilie an&s;wered,
becau&s;e they can ordinarily Load
and unload, and make returns to
England from <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> before
a Ship can get clear from <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI>
and the <HI>Texel:</HI> And ther|fore
your Engli&s;h Merchants find it
Cheaper and more commodious for
trade, that after their goods are
arrived at <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> to &s;end their
goods in boats Landward in, to <HI>Am|&s;terdam.</HI></P>
<P>This citie is famous as beeing the
place where Great <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> was
<PB N="12" REF="11">
born, who&s;e Statue of Bra&s;&s;e &s;tands
erected in the Market place; And al|though
the buldings here are not &s;o
&s;uperb as tho&s;e of <HI>Am&s;terdam, Ley|den</HI>
or <HI>Harlem,</HI> yet the places worth
the &s;eeing, are, fir&s;t the <HI>Great Church</HI>
where Several <HI>Admirals</HI> Lay State|ly
Entombed, here you &s;ee their
<HI>Admiralitie, Ea&s;t Indie,</HI> and <HI>Stat|hou&s;es</HI>
together with that caled, <HI>het
Gemeen Lands Huis.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Rotterdam</HI> you may for 5
&s;trivers have a boat to bring you to
Delph, but before you com thither
you pa&s;&s;e thro a faire village called
<HI>Over&s;chie,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>English</HI> youths are trayned up in lit|terautre,
as to the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI>
tongue, <HI>Booke keeping,</HI> &amp;c: from
thence in the &s;ame boat you com to
<HI>Delph</HI> which is famous for making
of Porceline to that degree, that it
much re&s;embles the China, but
onely it is not tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>In Delph is the great <HI>Maga&s;in</HI> of
<HI>Arms</HI> for the whole <HI>Province</HI> of
<PB N="13" REF="11">
<HI>Holland:</HI> Their churches are verie
large, in one of which are <HI>Tombs</HI> of
the <HI>Princes of Orange, Admiral
Tromp</HI> and General Morgans Ladie,
and in the Cloy&s;ter over again&s;t the
Church you have an In&s;cription in a
Pillar of Bra&s;&s;e, &s;hewing after what
manner <HI>William</HI> the 1, that famous
Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was Shot to death
by a mi&s;creant <HI>Je&s;ui&s;t,</HI> with his de|&s;erved
puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Delph</HI> hath the 3^d voyce in the
<HI>States of Holland,</HI> and &s;ends its
Deputies unto the Colledge of the
<HI>States General,</HI> and to all other col|ledges
of the <HI>Commonwealth.</HI> They
have al&s;o a Chamber in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indie
Companie,</HI> as &s;hal be more
largely &s;poken to, when we &s;hal com
to treat of the State of the &s;aid Com|panie.</P>
<P>From <HI>Delph</HI> you may by boat be
brought to the <HI>Hague</HI> for 2 Stivers
and an halfe: Which is accounted
the faire&s;t Village in the world, both
for Pompous buildings and the large|nes
<PB N="14" REF="12">
thereof; Here the <HI>Princes of
Orange</HI> hold their Re&s;idence: as
al&s;o the <HI>States General</HI> and the <HI>Coun|cel
of State,</HI> Here you have the
<HI>Courts of Ju&s;tice, Chancerie,</HI> and
other <HI>Courts of Law.</HI> Here you
&s;ee that <HI>Great Hall,</HI> in which ma|ny
Hundreds of coulers are hung

with whom they have waged

admired by all that &s;ee them. Ma|ny
faire <HI>Libraries</HI> they have be|longing
to particular men. The
<HI>Princes Pallace</HI> is a mo&s;t &s;uperb

Gardins of the Heer <HI>Bentham,</HI>

&s;peak of the &s;plendor of the <HI>Prince</HI>

of <HI>Orange</HI> his <HI>Court,</HI> of his noble
virtues and valour, of the mo&s;t vir|tuous

&s;hould infinitely fal &s;hort of what
ought to be, and which others
have alreadie don before me: and
therfore leaving the <HI>Hague,</HI> I &s;hal
onely tel you that from thence
you may for 7 Stivers have a boat
to bring you to <HI>Leyden. Leyden</HI>
is a faire and great citie, and the
Univer&s;itie is verie famous, beeing
frequented by 1000 of Students from
all parts, as <HI>Hungarie, Poland,
Germanie,</HI> yea from the <HI>Ottomans
Empire</HI> it &s;elf, who pretend to be
grecians, be&s;ides the Engli&s;h, Scots
and Iri&s;h, who this years were num|bred
to be above 80.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable things here
to be &s;een, I &s;hal &s;ummarilie &s;et
down: As the place called the <HI>Bergh,</HI>
formerly a <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> belonging to the
Prince of <HI>Liege</HI> in <HI>Flanders:</HI> The
<HI>Stathow&s;e,</HI> the <HI>&V;niver&s;itie</HI> Schooles,
<PB N="16" REF="13">
&s;pecially that of the <HI>Anatomie,</HI>
which excels all the <HI>Anatomie</HI>
Schooles in the world, a Book of the
rarities whereof you may have for 6
Stivers, their <HI>Phy&s;ick Garden,</HI> and
the Profe&s;&s;ors <HI>Clo&s;et</HI> are al ravi&s;hing
in rare Curio&s;ities. But as to their
<HI>Colledges,</HI> they are but two and ve|rie
&s;mall, not to be compared with
the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Hals</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> nei|ther
have they any endowments,
their maintenance being onely from
the charitable collections of the
<HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> of <HI>Holland,</HI> neyther
are any Students to remain longer
there, then til they attain the degree
of <HI>Batchelers</HI> of <HI>Art:</HI> One of the
Curators beeing demaunded by me,
why &s;o rich a <HI>Commonwealth</HI> as
<HI>Holland</HI> is, did not build and en|dow
<HI>Colledges</HI> after the manner of
<HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge,</HI> an&s;wered
they had not &s;o many able and pu|blick
&s;pirited men as are in <HI>England,</HI>
and to deal plainly with you, &s;aid
he, had we &s;uch <HI>Colledges,</HI> our
<PB N="17" REF="13">
<HI>Burgema&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Magi&s;trates</HI>
would fil them with their own and
their friends &s;ons, who by leading
a lazie and idle life would never be|com
capable to &s;erve the Common|wealth,
and therefore he judged it
much better to put them to Pen&s;ion
in Burgers how&s;es, leaveing them
to the care of the Profe&s;&s;ors, who
are verie diligent in keeping the Stu|dents
at their exerci&s;es, both at
Publick lectures and in their private
how&s;es al&s;o, where they cau&s;e them
Punctually at their appointed houres
to come to their examinations and
lectures, be&s;ides tho&s;e they have in
Publick. Their churches are rare,
&s;o are the walks round the citie, and
the fortifications verie plea&s;ing to
behold. Here you have the <HI>River
Rhine</HI> running through the citie and
falling into it from <HI>Catwyckop Zee.
Leyden</HI> is verie famous in hi&s;torie,
for the long Siege it held out again&s;t
the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> From hence for twelve
&s;tivers and an half you are brought
<PB N="18" REF="14">
to <HI>Harlem</HI> by water, being twelve
Engli&s;h miles.</P>
<P><HI>Harlem</HI> is famous in that <HI>Co&s;tor</HI>

the <HI>Art of Printing.</HI> This <HI>Co&s;tor</HI>
beeing &s;u&s;pected to be a Conjurer,
was fain to flee from <HI>Harlem</HI> to Co|logne
in <HI>Germany,</HI> and there Perfe|cted
his Invention, having in <HI>Har|lem</HI>
onely found out the way of prin|ting
on one &s;ide of the Paper. The
fir&s;t book he ever printed is kept in
the <HI>Stathou&s;e,</HI> for tho&s;e that are cu|rious

faire&s;t and large&s;t Churches of the 17
Provinces, in the wals whereof there
remain to this day &s;ticking <HI>canon

&s;ayled from <HI>Harlem</HI> to. <HI>Damiater,</HI>
&s;ea&s;ing the Ca&s;tle in which the Earl
of <HI>Holland</HI> was kept pri&s;oner, and

from thence, and now ring them
everie night at nine a clock.</P>
<P><HI>Harlem</HI> is renowned for making
the fine&s;t linnen cloth, Tyfinies
Dammasks and &s;ilk Stufs; al&s;o Ri|bands
and Tapes; They have Mils
by which they can weave fortie and
50 Pieces at a time, they make the
fine&s;t white thread and Tapes for
lace in the whole world, there <HI>Blea|cheries</HI>
&s;urpas al other what&s;oever,
their waters whitening cloath better
then any in the &s;eventeen Provinces:
They have a mo&s;t plea&s;ant grove like
a little <HI>Wood,</HI> divided into Walks
where on Sondays and holly dayes
the Citi&s;ens of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and other
places come to take their plea&s;ure.
<HI>Harlem</HI> is the &s;econd citie of <HI>Hol|land</HI>
and &s;ends in <HI>Deputies</HI> unto all
the <HI>Colledges</HI> of the <HI>Gouvernment.</HI>
From hence you have a pa&s;&s;age by
boat to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> for &s;ix &s;tivers,
but when you are come half way you
mu&s;t &s;tep out of one boat to goe in|to
<PB N="20" REF="15">
another, where you &s;ee a Stately
<HI>Pallace,</HI> where the Lords, called

2 large <HI>Sluces</HI> having gates to let in

1672 a part of the Seabanck was bro|ken
by a &s;trong Northwe&s;t wind,

<P>I come now to &s;peak of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI>
which having bin the place of

give a more large and punctual ac|count
thereof then I doe of other
places; It is e&s;teemed by Intelligent
men the &s;econd citie in the world for
<PB N="21" REF="15">
trade, and not inferiour to any in
wealth. Certainly <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is one
of the beautifulle&s;t cities in the
world, their buildings are large,
their &s;treets for the mo&s;t part plea|&s;antly
planted with trees &amp; paved &s;o
neatly, as is to be found no where els
in any other Countrie, &s;ave in &s;ome

as I have alreadie &s;aid, <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI>
may Ju&s;tly be taken for the &s;e|cond

now in treating of all the excellen|cies

&s;hal not hyperboli&s;e, or flatter: for

<PB N="22" REF="16">
of the citie, the fourth being &s;ecured

<HI>Bels,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> are
maintayned by the <HI>Magi&s;trate.</HI> All
the&s;e Churches or congregations
make up onely a third part of the
Inhabitants of the citie: The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI>
who have eightie five how&s;es or
Chappels to meet in for their wor|&s;hip,
make another third part, and
have a long &s;quare of how&s;es for
their Nuns to live in, who are not
&s;hut up in Cloy&s;ters, as in Papi&s;ts
countries they are wont to doe, but
may goe in and out at their plea&s;ure,
yea and marrie al&s;o if they grow
wearie of a <HI>Nunni&s;h</HI> life: The&s;e Chur|ches

conventicles, and are many times
<PB N="23" REF="16">
&s;hut up, and again opened at the

<P><HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> for the wi&s;e <HI>State&s;|men</HI>

for that it hath &s;uch great &s;tore of

many other nations. And &s;econdly
for the exceeding great <HI>Maga&s;in</HI>
of Spices, which in antient times

all parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> but now
is don by the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indie</HI> Companie

therewith, but many places in the
Indies al&s;o. Thirdly it hath incon|ceivable
&s;tore of al manner of pro|vi&s;ions
for war, In &s;o much that
<HI>England</HI> and divers other nations
&s;end to <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> to buy <HI>Arms,
Bufcoats, Belts, Match &amp;c:</HI> yea
here are &s;everal <HI>Shopkeepers</HI> who can
<PB N="25" REF="17">
deliver <HI>Armes</HI> for 4000 or 5000
men, and at a cheaper rate then
can be got any where el&s;e, and this
they can doe by rea&s;on of their great
Indu&s;try in the Ingro&s;&s;ing mo&s;t of
the Iron workes on the <HI>Rhine</HI> and

Forthly <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> hath more
&s;tore of &s;awed and prepared Tymber

one Nation in the world, and this is
the rea&s;on why her Neighbour town
<HI>Sardam</HI> is made capable of Building

can doe in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France:</HI> So
that both <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spaine</HI> do
many times buy them in <HI>Holland:</HI> as

both their <HI>Banks</HI> write not of &s;o

protect them, and that the <HI>Interlo|pers</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="36">

high tyme I &s;hould tell you the me|thodes
a &s;tranger mu&s;t take if he hath
occa&s;ion to Keep hou&s;e in <HI>Am&s;ter|dam:</HI>
If a man will hyer an hou&s;e,
he mu&s;t take a lea&s;e upon &s;eald pa|per,
for which you mu&s;t pay a <HI>Tax</HI>
to the <HI>States,</HI> and pay the <HI>Broaker</HI>
that makes the bargen, but before
you can buy a hou&s;e you mu&s;t be
in a capacitie to be made a <HI>Burger.</HI>
To this purpo&s;e it is u&s;uall to take
with you to the <HI>Stathou&s;e</HI> your
<HI>Broaker</HI> or any two <HI>Securityes,</HI> and
there before the <HI>Burgema&s;ters</HI> take
the oath of <HI>Burger&s;chap,</HI> which is to
be faithfull to the <HI>City,</HI> to the
<HI>Magi&s;trates</HI> and <HI>Goverment</HI> &amp;c.
but if you buy either <HI>Land</HI> or <HI>Hou|&s;es,</HI>
and lodge privately you will
find your ca&s;e much wor&s;e, Then
you mu&s;t pay a <HI>Legion</HI> of <HI>Taxes</HI> to
the <HI>mils</HI> that draine your <HI>Lands,</HI>
and for maintaining the <HI>Banks</HI> and
<HI>Sluces,</HI> and if the <HI>States</HI> have oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="63" REF="36">
to build a <HI>Fortification</HI> on

and if your hou&s;e or hou&s;es &s;tand

hou&s;e or hou&s;es; Thus much for

are to pay for <HI>hou&s;es</HI> or <HI>Land,</HI> if
you &s;ettel there, and if you have either
purcha&s;ed or hyred an hou&s;e then
comes an <HI>Officer</HI> from the <HI>Stathou&s;e</HI>

<P>For a Coach if you keepe one
75 Gilders a yeare.</P>

<P>For Butter every 20 pound &s;even

<P>For Turff every Tun five &s;tivers.</P>

&s;ix Gilders.</P>
<P>For Fle&s;h the <HI>Tax</HI> often changeth:</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a <HI>Tax</HI> on the Bread.</P>
<P>Then there is a <HI>Tax</HI> called the
200&s;te penny, and a <HI>Tax</HI> called the
8th: then there are many Taxes in
Trade, as that no man can weigh
or mea&s;ure out his owne Goods if
&s;ould in gro&s;&s;e, but the <HI>States
Officers</HI> mu&s;t doe it, Then the
<HI>States</HI> have a <HI>Tax</HI> called the <HI>Ver|pounding</HI>
on all <HI>Lands</HI> and <HI>Hou&s;es</HI>
in their <HI>Dominions;</HI> Then they have
a <HI>Tax</HI> on &s;eald paper, and a <HI>Tax</HI> for
<PB N="65" REF="37">
Regi&s;tering Lands or hou&s;es, like|wi&s;e
a <HI>Tax</HI> on <HI>Cowes, Hor&s;es,

that goes out or into any <HI>City</HI> after
the houer of &s;hutting the Ports,
al&s;o you pay for going over
&s;om <HI>Bridges,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing thro
<HI>Gates</HI> called <HI>Tolhek,</HI> a &s;tiver for
every per&s;ons, but <HI>Coaches, Wagons</HI>
or <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> pay more; The&s;e I have
already named; you will &s;ay, are
to many, yet I may not forget to
tell you, that <HI>Milke</HI> fir&s;t payes as
<HI>Milke,</HI> and again if it be made <HI>Butter</HI>
yea the <HI>Buttermilke,</HI> and <HI>whay</HI> payes
a <HI>Tax</HI> likewi&s;e, for all which a man
would think that a <HI>people</HI> that &s;tand
&s;o much upon maintaining of their
liberty &s;hould <HI>mutinie</HI> and refu&s;e
payment. But this &s;eldome happens,
and if it doth the <HI>States</HI> puni&s;h them
very &s;everely. I remember that in
my tyme there was a mutinie at <HI>Sar|dam</HI>
about paying a new <HI>Tax,</HI>
<PB N="66" REF="38">
whereupon the <HI>States</HI> &s;ent a <HI>Regi|ment</HI>
of their <HI>Souldiers,</HI> and &s;ealed
the heads of the <HI>Mutiniers</HI> and
hanged up 5 or &s;ix of them at the
Townes end, and &s;everely whipt
8 under the <HI>Gallowes;</HI> And in the
rich City of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> if any re|fu&s;e
to pay their <HI>Tax,</HI> the <HI>Magi|&s;trates</HI>
&s;end their Officer to pull of
their <HI>Dores,</HI> and if they remaine
long ob&s;tinate, they &s;end and
fetch away the lower <HI>Windowes</HI> of
their hou&s;e, and they dare not put
up others, until they have payd the
Taxes; Howerer this is ob&s;ervable
that if any man will &s;weare he is not
worth what he is taxed at, then he
is free: but there are many &s;o proud,
that they will not let the world Know
their Condition, I Knew a Mer|chant
named Ornia, who payd du|ring
the war for his 200&s;te penny
and other Taxes for his and his wives
Children, (haveing had two rich
wives) 14000 pound &s;terlyng: I al&s;o

to pay his Maje&s;ties <HI>Con&s;ul</HI> a pit|tyfull
fee or Con&s;ulat money on
his Ships: the rea&s;on whereof I
once asked him, who an&s;wered me
that the King could not rai&s;e a penny
in England without his Parlement,
and therefore much le&s;s, could he
doe it in the <HI>States</HI> Country: Thus
the&s;e Phanaticks had rather make
bricks without &s;traw, then pay the
lea&s;t tribut to their Naturall Princes
Officer: &s;hould wee in England be
obliged to pay the Taxes that are
here impo&s;ed, there would be Re|bellion,
upon Rebellion: and yet
after all that is here payd no man
may bake his owne bread, or grind
his owne corne, or brew his beere,
nor dare any man keepe in his hou&s;e
a hand Mil, althought it be but to

bought a live <HI>Pig</HI> in the market

Kild it, for which he had like to
have been ruinated, becau&s;e he did
not fri&s;t &s;end to the acci&s;emen to

At an other time a wyne Merchant
comeing to give me a Vi&s;it, tould
me that he had the rare&s;t Rhini&s;h
in the City, and that if I would
&s;end my maid to his Cellar with &s;ix
Bottels they &s;hould be fild: where|upon
I &s;ent the maid only with
two bottels, and charged her to
hide them under her apron, but
<PB N="69" REF="39">
&s;uch was her misfortune that the
Scouts Dienaers met her and &s;eized
her and her bottels, and caryed
her to Pri&s;on, which co&s;t the Wyne
Merchant 1500 Gilders, and had it
not bin for the &s;tronge&s;t &s;olicita|tions

&s;o &s;acred are Taxes here and mu&s;t &s;o

not here &s;o preci&s;e, it were Im|po&s;&s;ible

indeed in a &s;en&s;e it is &s;o for they have

have the publick pur&s;e to maintaine

them, and this is one maine rea&s;on
why they &s;o willingly pay their Taxes

all his hou&s;es and Goods were &s;ould

<P>I now come to &s;peake &s;ome thing
of the three Taxes I mentioned in the
former part of my remarques on
<HI>Taxes,</HI> of which the fir&s;t ought
rather to be called an u&s;efull and
publique invention, like to that of
the In&s;urance Office in <HI>London,</HI>
then a publick Tax, &s;eeing no man
needs contribute to it unle&s;s they
plea&s;e, and find his profit by it,
but the other may be called Taxes
becau&s;e the &s;ubjects are obliged to
<PB N="84" REF="47">
&s;ubmit to them, but then they are
&s;o ea&s;y, that what the Publick
gets thereby not only le&s;&s;ons Ex|traordinary
&s;ub&s;idies, which many
tymes occa&s;ions clamour, when be|cau&s;e
of their raritie and the ur|gencie
of occa&s;ions, they mu&s;t needs
be great.</P>
<P>Yet it is &s;ufficently compen&s;ated
by the advantage and &s;ecuritie in
the E&s;tates which private per&s;ons,
who are obliged to pay it, reape
thereby dayly; I am confident that
if the King and Parlement thought
fit to introduce &s;ome or all three
of the&s;e taxes into <HI>England,</HI> the
publick charge of Goverment might
be defrayed with more ea&s;e and
with le&s;s repining and clamour, then
when it mu&s;t be done by new and
high Impo&s;itions, how ever our
Governers are the proper Judges of
that.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t then is an <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> called

tyme is brought into the Bank un|coyned,
the &s;ecurity given for pre|&s;ervation
thereof, are the <HI>States</HI> and
Magi&s;trates of <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> Now
if you have a mind to put money
into the Bank, &s;uppo&s;e a 1000 L. le&s;s
or more, you mu&s;t goe to the Clarks
and ask a folio for your name, and
then pay in your money at three or
foure per cent according as the rate
of the Bank money is high or low,
or you may buy it of tho&s;e called
<HI>Cashiers</HI> or Broakers: then get the
Clarks to &s;et downe in the folio what
you bring in, haveing done &s;o you
may draw this &s;umme, or &s;ell it in
what parcels you plea&s;e, but then if
you let your money lye &s;even yeares
in the Bank, you receive no Intre&s;t
for the &s;ame. If you aske where then
is the advantage for the Merchants?
I an&s;wer fir&s;t you have your money
ready at all tymes for an&s;wering

bills of Exchange, and making other
payments: you are at no charge

danger of Thieves or unfaithfull
&s;ervants, or fire, and above all you
have the accounts of your ca&s;h mo&s;t
punctually and Ju&s;tly kept without
any trouble or runing the risk of

they pay a mulct to the Clarkes upon
their Covincing them of their mis|takes,
either by chargeing to much

omitting what was their due. I
knew two Merchants, who haveing

of the moneyes written of by them

any Merchants account, and what

would appeare; For among other
things which might be &s;aid, The Ma|gi&s;trates

for Poore people, yea
for Merchants al&s;o, who &s;ome tymes
may want money to pay a bill of Ex|change,
and prevents the Cheatting
and Extraordinary Extortion u&s;ed by
the Pawne brokers in <HI>England, France</HI>

the Poore have their <HI>Pawns</HI> &s;afely

out or denied under the pretext of
being mi&s;laid, as the Poore are of|ten

another convenience in this <HI>Lumbert</HI>
viz, an Exellent way they have of

the French became Ma&s;ters

even in the &s;trong and rich Citty of
<HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> it &s;elf, who at this tyme
beheld the French Armie like a

to frowne on them as well as the

Courage and rather choo&s;e to dye

Treacherou&s;ly to yeald up their Cit|ty

<P>A &s;econd was, when that Bloody

Thus he began his march with a de|&s;igne

might have done in all probabilitie,

I will &s;ay no more of this &s;ub|ject

according to prome&s;s in the begin|ning
of this book, to give the
reader &s;ome Remarkes I made in
other Countries where I have been
during my &s;ixteen years travels. To
give a full account of all that might
be ob&s;erved in &s;o many Countries,
is not a taske for one man, nor a &s;ub|ject
for &s;o &s;mall a book; I &s;hall
onely therefore briefely take notice
of &s;ome remarkable matters which
may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;atisfie the
curio&s;itie of my Country men who
have not been in the &s;aid places,
and convince, if po&s;&s;ible, all of
them, that no Countrey that ever
I was in, afords &s;o great convenien|cies
<PB N="117" REF="63">
for the generalitie of people to
live in, as the Kingdome of <HI>England</HI>
doth. Though I have twice made

my return back to <HI>England</HI> travel|led
a third time through <HI>Holland</HI>
as for as <HI>Strasbourg,</HI> and &s;o back by

yet the reader is not to ex|pect
I &s;hould follow a Geographicall
method and order in &s;peaking of the
places I have been in; that is to be
lookt for in the map, and not in tra|vels;
but onely that I mention pla|ces
as I found them on my rode ac|cording
as bu&s;ines or curio&s;itie led
mee to travel.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t con&s;iderable place I
then met with, after I was out of
the dominions of the <HI>States Gene|ral</HI>
was <HI>Cleave</HI> the capital citie of
the Province &s;o called, a fair
and lovely citie &s;tanding upon the
<HI>Rhine</HI> and the rivers <HI>Wall</HI> and <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k.</HI>
This Province much re&s;embles <HI>Eng|land</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="64" MS="y">
in rich &s;oyl and plea&s;antne&s;s of
its rivers. The inhabitants of the
Countrey would have mee beleeve
that they were originally de&s;cended
of tho&s;e <HI>Saxons</HI> who made a de&s;cent
in to <HI>England,</HI> and conquered it; and
to convince the truth of this, they
&s;hew'd mee a cloy&s;ter &s;tanding on
a hill, called <HI>Eltham,</HI> from which
they &s;ay our <HI>Eltham</HI> in Kent had
its name. I was made to ob&s;erve
al&s;o two places &s;tanding upon the
<HI>Rhine</HI> neare <HI>Emmerick</HI> called <HI>Doad|ford,</HI>
and <HI>Gron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wich,</HI> which accor|ding
to them, gave the names to
<HI>Dedford</HI> and <HI>Greenwich</HI> in <HI>England;</HI>
but many &s;uch analogies and &s;imi|litudes
of names are to be found in
other places of Germany, but e&s;pe|cially
in uper <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>Denmark.</HI>
The greate&s;t part of this Province
of <HI>Cleave,</HI> and part of the duchy's
of <HI>Julieres</HI> and <HI>Berg,</HI> and of the
Provinces of <HI>Marke</HI> and <HI>Ravens|bourg</HI>
belongs to the Elector of
<HI>Brandenbourg,</HI> the re&s;t belonging
<PB N="119" REF="64">
to the Duke of <HI>Newbourg</HI> now Ele|ctor
<HI>Palatine,</HI> and the Elector of
<HI>Cologne.</HI> The inhabitants are partly
Roman Catholicks, partly Luthe|rans,
and partly Calvini&s;ts, who
all live promi&s;cuou&s;ly and peaceably
together both in city and Countrey.
The citie of Cleave is the out mo&s;t
limit of the territories of the Ele|ctor
of <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> on this &s;ide of
Germany; from whence his Electo|rall
Highne&s;s can travel two hun|dred
dutch miles out right in his
own Dominions, and never &s;leep
out of his own Countrey but one
night in the territories of the Bi&s;hop
of <HI>O&s;nabrug.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Cleave</HI> I went to a &s;mall
town called <HI>Rhinberg,</HI> but a
very &s;trong fortification belonging
to the Elector of <HI>Cologne;</HI> which
dies at two miles di&s;tance from the
citie of <HI>We&s;el</HI> that belongs to the
Elector of <HI>Brandenbourg.</HI> Through
<HI>Di&s;&s;eldorpe:</HI> &s;cituated on the Rhine,
and the Re&s;idence of the duke of
<PB N="120" REF="65">
<HI>Newbourg,</HI> I went next to
<HI>Cologne</HI> a very large city, called by
the Romans <HI>Colonia Agrippina,</HI>
and the French <HI>Rome d'Allema|gne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cologne</HI> is an Imperial citie and
a Republick, though for &s;ome things
it does Homage to the Elector of
that name, and receives an oath
from him. It is much decayed with|in
the&s;e hundred years, having
been much prie&s;t ridden, a mi&s;fortune
that hath undone many other great
cities. The Je&s;uits have had &s;o
great influence upon the Magi&s;trats,
that they prevailed with them to
bani&s;h all Prote&s;tants, who remo|ved
to <HI>Hambourg</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI>
&s;o that <HI>Cologne</HI> is become &s;o di&s;peo|pled,
that the hou&s;es dayly fall to
ruine for want of inhabitants, and
a great deal of corn and wine now
grows within the walls, upon ground
where hou&s;es formerly &s;tood. I dare
be bold to affirm that there is twice
the number of inhabitants in the
<PB N="121" REF="65">
pari&s;h of St. <HI>Martins</HI> in the fields,
then there is in <HI>Cologne;</HI> and yet it
contains as many pari&s;h churches,
mona&s;teries and chappels, as there
are days in the year. The &s;treets
are very large, and &s;o are the hou&s;es
al&s;o, in many of which one may
drive a Coach or waggon into the
fir&s;t room from the &s;treets; but the
&s;treets are &s;o thin of people, that
one may pa&s;s &s;ome of them and
not meet ten men or women, unle&s;s
it be Church men or Religious &s;i&s;ters.
The mo&s;t con&s;iderable inhabitants
of the citie are Prote&s;tant Mer|chants,
tho but few in number,
and they not allowed a Church
neither, but a place called <HI>Woullin</HI>
a mile without the citie: the re&s;t of
the inhabitants who are lay men are
mi&s;erably poor. There are no le&s;s
than 3000 Students in <HI>Cologne</HI>
taught by the Je&s;uits <HI>gratis,</HI> who
have the priviledge to beg in mu&s;i|call
notes in the day time, and take
to them &s;elves the liberty of bor|rowing
<PB N="122" REF="66">
hats and cloaks in the night:
but if in the Je&s;uits Schools there
be any rich Burgema&s;ters &s;ons who
have parts, they are &s;ure to be &s;napt
up and adopted into the &s;ocietie.
Formerly, before the matter was
otherwi&s;e adju&s;ted in the diet of
<HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> there have been de&s;igns
of voteing Prote&s;tant Magi&s;trats into
the government again; but &s;o &s;oon
as the Je&s;uits come to di&s;cover who
of the Magi&s;trats were for that, they
immediately preferred their &s;ons or
daughters, and made them chanons,
abbots or chanone&s;&s;es, and &s;o diver|ted
them by intere&s;t. It's pity to
&s;ee a city &s;o famous for traffike in
former times now brought to &s;o
great a decay, that were it not for
the trade of Rheni&s;h wine it would
be utterly for&s;aken, and left wholy
to the Church men. The conti|nuall
alarms the Magi&s;trats have had
by forreign de&s;igns upon their li|berty,
and the jealou&s;ies fo|mented
among them&s;elfs, as it is
<PB N="123" REF="66">
thought, by the Agents and fa|vourers
of France, and e&s;pecially the
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Stra&s;bourg,</HI> have for
&s;everall yeares kept them in conti|nuall
di&s;quiet, and nece&s;&s;itated them
to rai&s;e great taxes which hath not a
litle contributed to the impoveri&s;hing
of the people e&s;pecially the boars
round about; who tho the Coun|trey
they live in be one of the mo&s;t
plea&s;ant and fertile plains of Ger|many,
yet are &s;o wretchedly poor
that canvas cloaths, wooden &s;hoes,

worldly happine&s;s that mo&s;t of
them can attain unto. The Elector of
<HI>Cologne</HI> is a venerable old man, Bi|&s;hop
of four great bi&s;hopricks, viz
<HI>Cologne, Liege,</HI> Mun&s;ter, and <HI>Hel|dershime.</HI>
He divides his time
betwixt his devotion and experimen|tal
&s;tudies, being punctuall in &s;aying
of ma&s;s every morning, and con|&s;tant
in his Elaboratory in the af|ternoon;

fort called <HI>Herminshine,</HI>
built on a high rocky hill as high
again as <HI>Windforca&s;tle,</HI> and on the
north &s;ide of it the River Mo&s;el
falls into the Rhine, over which
there is a Stately &s;tone bridge. This
Prince governs his &s;ubjects as the
other Spirituall Electors doe, that
is, both by temporall and &s;pirituall
<PB N="125" REF="67">
authority, which in that Country is
pretty ab&s;olute. The chiefe trade
of this Countrey is in wine, corn,
wood and Iron.</P>
<P>The next Countrey I came to
was that of the Elector of <HI>Mayence</HI>
who is likewi&s;e both a &s;ecular and
Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Prince and governs
his &s;ubjects accordingly. He is
reckoned to be wholely for the In|tere&s;ts
of the French King; who
notwith&s;tanding of that, pretends
a title to the citadel of <HI>Mayence.</HI>
As I was upon my Journey to
<HI>Mayence</HI> by land, I made a turn
down the Rhin to vi&s;it the famous
litle city of <HI>Backrack,</HI> and &s;ome
towns belonging to the Landgrave
of He&s;&s;en, but e&s;pecially <HI>Backrack,</HI>
becau&s;e Travellers &s;ay it much re|&s;embles
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in its &s;cituation
and manner of buildings. The
Burgema&s;ter of this city told mee
that the whole Country about
<HI>Backrack</HI> does not yield above 200
fouders of wine a year; And yet
<PB N="126" REF="68">
the Merchants of <HI>Dort</HI> by an art
of multiplication which they have
u&s;ed &s;ome years, furni&s;h <HI>England</HI>
with &s;everall thou&s;ande of fouders.
Here I &s;hall take the liberty to re|late
a &s;trange &s;tory which I found
recorded in this Countrey; tho I
know it to be mentioned in Hi&s;tory.
There was a certain cruel and inhu|mane.
Bi&s;shop of <HI>Mayence,</HI> who in
a year of great &s;carcity and famine
when a great number of Poor people
came to his gates begging for bread,
cau&s;ed the Poor wretches, men, wo|men
and children to be put into
a barn&punc; under pretext of relieving
their nece&s;&s;ities; but &s;o &s;oon as
they were got in, cau&s;ed the barn
doors to be &s;hut, fire &s;et to it, and
&s;o burnt them all alive: And whil'&s;t
the poor wretches cried and &s;hree|ked
out for horrour and pain, the
Barbarous mi&s;creant &s;aid to tho&s;e
that were about him, harke how
the Rats and mice doe crie. But
the ju&s;t Judgement of God &s;uffe|red
<PB N="127" REF="68">
not the fact to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed;
for not long after the cruel Bi&s;hop
was &s;o haunted with Rats and mice,
that all the guards he kept about
him, could not &s;ecure him from
them, neither at table nor in
bed, At length he re&s;olved to flee
for &s;afetie into a tower that &s;tood in
the middle of the Rhine; but the Rats
pur&s;ued him, got into his chamber
and devoured him alive; &s;o that the
Ju&s;tice of the Almighty made him
a prey to vermine who had inhu|manely
reckoned his fellow Chri|&s;tians
to be &s;uch. The tower which
I &s;aw, to this day is called the
Rats-tower, and the &s;tory is upon
record in the city of <HI>Mayence.</HI></P>
<P>On my Journey from thence I
came to the litle village of <HI>Hockom</HI>
not far di&s;tant, famous for our
Hockomore wine, of which though
the place does not produce above
150 fouders a year; yet the Inge|nions
Hollanders of <HI>Dort</HI> make
&s;ome thou&s;and fouders of it goe
<PB N="128" REF="69">
of, in England and the Indies.</P>
<P>From <HI>Hockom</HI> I proceeded to
<HI>Francfort</HI> a plea&s;ant city upon the
river of Maine, called formerl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y
<HI>Teutoburgum</HI> and <HI>Helenopolis</HI> and
&s;ince <HI>Francfort,</HI> becaus here the
<HI>Franconians</HI> who came out of the
Province of <HI>Franconia</HI> foarded over,
when they went upon their expe|dition
into <HI>Gallia,</HI> which they con|quered
and named it <HI>France:</HI> and I
thought it might very well de&s;erve
the name of <HI>Petty-London,</HI> becau&s;e
of its Priviledges, and the humour
of the citizens. It is a Han&s;iatick
and Imperiall town and Common|wealth,
the Magi&s;trats being Luthe|rans
which is the publick e&s;tabli&s;hed
Religion; though the Cathedrall
church belongs to the Roman
Catholicks who al&s;o have &s;everall
mona&s;teries there. The citie is
populous and frequented by all
&s;orts of Merchants, from mo&s;t parts
of Europe, &amp; part of A&s;ia al&s;o, becaus
of the two great faires that are yearely
<PB N="129" REF="69">
kept there, Many Jews live in this
city, and the riche&s;t Merchants are
Calvini&s;ts, who are not &s;uffered to
have a Church in the town, but
half an houres journey out of it, at
a place called <HI>Bucknam,</HI> where I have
told &s;eventy four Coaches at a time
all belonging to Merchants of the
city. It was in ancient times much
enriched by <HI>Charle le maigne</HI> and
hath been &s;ince by the con&s;titution
of the <HI>Golden bull:</HI> among&s;t other
honours &amp; Priviledges its appointed
to be the place of the Emperours
Election, where many of the orna|ments
belonging to that Augu&s;t
ceremonie are to be &s;een. It is &s;trongly
fortified having a &s;tately &s;tone bridge
over the Maine that joynes it to <HI>Saxe|hou&s;en</HI>
the quarter of the great ma&s;ter
of the Toutonick order. The
government is ea&s;y to the people,
they not being taxed as other cities
are, and had it not been for the
Alarmes the French gave them du|ring
the la&s;t war, they had not been
<PB N="130" REF="70">
much troubled, but being forced to
keep three or four thou&s;and men in
con&s;tant pay to defend their fortifi|cations,
the Magi&s;trats were con&s;trai|ned
to rai&s;e money by a tax. Be|&s;ides
that of the Emperour, they are
under the protection of &s;ome neigh|bouring
Princes, as of the Land|grave
of He&s;&s;en-<HI>Ca&s;&s;ells,</HI> Landgrave
of <HI>Arme&s;tadt,</HI> the Count of <HI>Solmes</HI>
and the count of <HI>Hanau,</HI> who are
either Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts,
among&s;t whom the Late Elector-<HI>Palatine</HI>
was al&s;o one; but whether
the pre&s;ent who is Roman Catholick
be &s;o or not, I cannot tel. This
city takes great care of their poor,
and in their charitie to poor travel|lers
exceed Holland. I have &s;een a
li&s;t of &s;eaven thou&s;and whom they
relieved in one year. Their great
ho&s;pitall is a large court or palace,
where the Engli&s;h Merchants for|merly
lived, in the time of Queen
<HI>mary's</HI> per&s;ecution of the Prote&s;tants,
who when they were recalled by
<PB N="131" REF="70">
Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI> were &s;o generous
as to give the whole court, with
all their Packhou&s;es and lands to the
poor of the city. It was my fortune
to be there in that cold Winter in
the year 1683. and &s;aw a ceremonie
performed by the Wine coopers of
the citie, who are obliged by law, that
when ever the Maine lyes fa&s;t frozen
over for eight days together, to
make a great Fouder fat, Hoops
and Staves; and &s;et it up compleat
upon the Ice. It was very good diver|&s;ion
to &s;ee &s;o many hands at worke,
and to ob&s;erve the jollity and mirth
of the many thou&s;ands of &s;pectators
who wanted not plenty of Rheni&s;h
wine to carou&s;e in.</P>
<P>I had the curio&s;itie afterward to
goe to the court of the Landgrave
of <HI>Arme&s;tadt</HI> a Lutheran Prince who
lives in part of the riche&s;t &s;oyle in
Germany. His Highne&s;s is a very
courteous and obligeing Prince to
Strangers, and his &s;ubjects are in
a pretty good condition again,
<PB N="132" REF="71">
though they have been great &s;uf|ferers
by the la&s;t war between the
Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;en</HI> and this fa|milie.</P>
<P>From thence I went to <HI>Heidleberg</HI>
a city I had been formerly in, in the
life time of that wi&s;e tho unfortunate
Prince Elector elder brother to Prince
Rupert. Here I had the Honour
to pay-my dutifull re&s;pects to the
Elector the &s;on of that great Prince,
who&s;e commi&s;&s;ary I had the honour
to be for two years together in <HI>Am|&s;terdam.</HI>
This Prince, &s;ince my being
there, is lately dead, and left behind
him the reputation of having been
a Zealous thorough paced Calvini&s;t,
and &s;o con&s;tant a frequenter of the
church, that &s;ome Sundays he went
thrice a day to Sermon; but never
failed, if in health, to be once a
day at lea&s;t at the garri&s;on-church;
where he took particular notice of
&s;uch officers as were ab&s;ent. He was
married to a mo&s;t virtuous lady the
Royall &s;i&s;ter of the King of Denmark
<PB N="133" REF="71">
and his brother Prince George.
During his life time the univer&s;ity
of Heidleberg flouri&s;hed exceedingly,
&s;o that the number of &s;tudents was
&s;o great that Chambers and lodgings
in the citie were &s;carce, and <HI>Span|hemius</HI>
was about quitting <HI>Leyden</HI>
to return to his profe&s;&s;ors place in
<HI>Heidleberg,</HI> but how matters &s;tand
&s;ince his death, I am as yet ignorant.
This Countrey is called the paradi&s;e
of <HI>Germany</HI> for its fruitfulne&s;s in
wine, corn, and all &s;orts of fruit.
I my &s;elf have &s;een growing in one
plain at the &s;ame time, vines, corn,
che&s;tnuts, almonds, dates, figs,
cherries, be&s;ides &s;everall other &s;orts
of fruit. And as the Countrey is
fertile in yeelding the fruits of the
Earth, &s;o the people are carefull
in providing &s;tore room for them.
This I take notice of becau&s;e of the
prodigious Rheni&s;h wine fats which
are to be &s;een there, among&s;t which
there are &s;eaven, the lea&s;t whereof
holds the quantitie of 250 barells
<PB N="134" REF="72">
of Beere as I calculated; but the
large and mo&s;t celebrated fat is that
which goes by the name of the great
Tun of <HI>Heidleberg,</HI> and holds 204
fouders of wine, and co&s;t 705 L.
Sterling in buildiug, for which one
may have a very good hou&s;e built.
This fat I have &s;een twice, and
the fir&s;t time was, when the Elector
treated the French Amba&s;&s;adours
that came to conclude the match
betwixt his daughter and <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI>
the French Kings brother, who
married her after the death of our
Kings &s;i&s;ter his fir&s;t wife: at which
treat there happened an adventure
that I &s;hall here plea&s;e the Reader
with. In a gallery that is over this
fat the Elector cau&s;ed a table to be
placed in the midle, exactly above
the bunghole of this Mon&s;trous ve&s;|&s;ell,
and to be covered with a co&s;tly
banquet of all &s;orts of &s;weet meats:
The day before, all the wine being
emptied out of this Tun into other
Fats, a litle before the Amba&s;&s;a|dours
<PB N="135" REF="72">
with other forrein Mini&s;ters
and Per&s;ons of qualitie mounted the
&s;tairs to come to the place of enter|tainment;
The Elector cau&s;ed twelve
drummers with as many Trumpeters,
&s;ome Kettledrums and other mu&s;ick
to be lodged in the belly of the Tun,
with orders to &s;trike up upon a &s;ignall
given, when the Elector drank the
French Kings health. All being
&s;ate down at table and merrily fee|ding,
the Elector drank the health,
and the &s;ignall was given; whereupon
the mu&s;ick began to play its part
with &s;uch a roaring and uncouth
noi&s;e out of that va&s;t cavitie below,
that the French and other Per&s;ons
of qualitie who were unacquainted
with the de&s;igne, looking upon it to
be an infernall and ominous &s;ound,
in great a&s;toni&s;hment began to cry
out <HI>Je&s;u Marie. The worlds at
an end,</HI> and to &s;hift every one for
him&s;elf in &s;o great di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion,
that for ha&s;te to be gone
they tumbled down &s;taires one over
<PB N="136" REF="73">
another. All that the Elector could
&s;ay to compo&s;e them, was either not
heard or not valued, nor could any
thing &s;atisfie and rea&s;&s;ure them, till
they &s;aw the Actors com marching
out of their den. Had not many
Per&s;ons of qualitie and travellers &s;een
this Fat as wel as my &s;elf who know
that what I &s;ay of its incredible
bigne&s;s to be true, I &s;hould be
afraid the Reader might think I im|po&s;ed
upon his credulitie.</P>
<P>From <HI>Heidleberg</HI> I went to &s;ee
that impregnable Fort or citadell
of <HI>Manheim alias Fredericks-berg</HI>
built by the Elector Frederick
brother to Prince Rupert, a Prince
of as good a head as any Germany
affoarded, who though &s;ome have
too partially Judged of him by his
mi&s;fortunes, yet by the wi&s;e&s;t of
the age was acconnted the Cato of
Germany. The wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t-men
of the world have been unfortunate,
which makes &s;ome to be of the
opinion that God in his wi&s;dom
<PB N="137" REF="73">
thinks fit it &s;hould be &s;o, lea&s;t
otherwi&s;e they might attribute their
pro&s;peritie rather to the wi&s;e dire|ction
of their own conduct, then
his all &s;eeing Providence: and in|deed,
dayly experience &s;eemes to
evince the truth of this, &s;ince wee
&s;ee knaves and fools advanced to
preferment and riche&s;s, when men
of virtue and parts die neglected and
poor in the eyes of the world, though
rich in the enioyment of a contented
mind. But this is a digre&s;&s;ion which
the honour I have for the memory
of that great man hath led mee into,
and therefore I hope will be pardo|ned
by the Reader. In the citadel
of <HI>Manheim</HI> I &s;aw &s;ome of the Re|cords
of that illu&s;trious familie, which
without di&s;pute is the mo&s;t ancient
of all the Secular Electors, being
elder to that of <HI>Bavaria</HI> which
&s;prung from one and the &s;ame &s;tock,
to wit, two Emperours of Ger|many.
Many writers derive them
originally from <HI>Charle le maigne,</HI> by
<PB N="138" REF="74">
the line of <HI>Pepin</HI> King of France.
There have been &s;everall Emperours
of that race, one King of <HI>Denmark</HI>
and four Kings of <HI>Sweden,</HI> one of
which was King of <HI>Norway</HI> al&s;o,
be&s;ides many great Generals of Ar|mies
in <HI>Germany, Hungary, France</HI>
and other Countries. Since I can
remember there vere five Prote&s;tant
Princes heires to that Electorall di|gnity
alive; which now by their death
is fallen to the Duke of <HI>Nowbourg</HI> a
Roman Catholick, who&s;e Daughter
is Empre&s;s of Germany and another
of his Daughters maryed to the King
of Portugall. Being &s;o neare Stra&s;|bourg,
I had the curio&s;itie to goe &s;ee
what figure that famous citie now
made &s;ince it had changed its ma|&s;ter;
for I had been thrice there
before, when it flouri&s;hed under the
Emperours protection, with the li|berty
of a Hau&s;iatick town: And
Indeed I found it &s;o di&s;figured, that
had it not been for the &s;tately Ca|thedrall
Church, and fair &s;treets and
<PB N="139" REF="74">
buildings, I could &s;carcely have
know'n it. In the &s;treets and
Exchange which formerly were
thronged with &s;ober rich and peace|able
Merchants, you meet with
none hardly now but men in buff
Coats and &s;carffs with rabbles of
Soldiers their attendants. The
churches I confe&s;s are gayer, but not
&s;o much frequented by the inhabi|tants
as heretofore, &s;eing the Lu|therans
are thru&s;t into the meane&s;t
churches and mo&s;t of the chiefe
Merchants both Lutherans and
Calvini&s;ts removed to <HI>Holland</HI> and
<HI>Hambourg.</HI> Within a few years, I
beleeve it will be ju&s;t &s;uch another
city for trade and Riche&s;s as <HI>Bri&s;ac</HI>
is. It was formerly a rich city and
well &s;tockt with Merchants and
wealthy inhabitants, who lived under
a gentle and ea&s;y government; but
now the Magi&s;trats have litle el&s;e
to doe in the government, but
onely to take their rules and mea|&s;ures
from a citadell and great guns,
<PB N="140" REF="75">
which are Edicts that Merchants
lea&s;t under&s;tand. I confe&s;s Stra&s;|bourg
is the le&s;s to be pityed that
it &s;o tamely became a &s;lave, and put
on its chains without any &s;trugling.
Tho&s;e Magi&s;trats who were in&s;tru|ments
in it, are now &s;en&s;ible of their
own folly, and bite their nails for
anger, finding them&s;elves no better
but rather wor&s;e hated than the
other Magi&s;trats, who did what
they could to hinder the reception
of their new ma&s;ters the <HI>French.</HI> I
quickly grew weary of being here,
meeting with nothing but com|plaints
of poverty, and paying
exorbitant taxes; I therefore &s;oon
returned to my <HI>Petty-London
Francfort,</HI> and from thence went to
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ells,</HI> the chiefe re&s;idence of the
Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;en.</HI> This Prince
is a Calvini&s;t, as mo&s;t of his &s;ubjects
are, very grave and Zealous in his
religion: He married a Prince&s;s
of <HI>Courland,</HI> by whom he hath an
hopefull i&s;&s;ue, to wit, three &s;ons
<PB N="141" REF="75">
and two Daughters. The late King
was God father to one of his &s;ons,
who was Chri&s;tened by the name
of <HI>Charles.</HI> Captain <HI>William Legg</HI>
Brother to the Lord <HI>Dartmouth</HI>
repre&s;enting his Maje&s;tie as his
Envoy. The court of this Prince
does indeed re&s;emble a well gover|ned
colledge, or Religious Cloy&s;ter,
in regard of its mode&s;tie and regu|laritie
in all things, and e&s;pecially
in the houres of devotion. He is
rich in money, and entertains about
nine thou&s;and men in con&s;tant pay,
under the command of <HI>Count van
derlipp,</HI> a brave and expert Soldier
his Lieutenant Generall; but can
bring many more upon occa&s;ion
into field. This familie hath been
very happy both in its progenie and
alliances, many wi&s;e Princes of both
&s;exes having &s;prung from it; and
the mother of this pre&s;ent Landgrave
may be reckoned among&s;t the illu|&s;trious
women of the pre&s;ent and
pa&s;t ages. After the death of Wil|liam
<PB N="142" REF="76">
the 5. Landgrave of He&s;&s;en her
husband, &s;he not only &s;upported
but advanced the war wherein he
was engaged, did many &s;ignall
actions, Enlarged her territories,
and at the conclu&s;ion of the peace
kept under her pay 56 Cornets of
hor&s;e in five Regiments, 166 Com|panies
of foot, be&s;ides thirteen
Companies of Dragons, and 14
independent Companies, in all 249
Companies of hor&s;e and foot; &s;he
was a Prince&s;s extreamly obliging to
&s;trangers: e&s;pecially virtuous and
learned divines. I had the honour
a good many yeares agoe to ki&s;&s;e her
highne&s;&s;es hand; at which time &s;he
was mighty Zealous in promoting
an accommodation among&s;t diffe|rent
Religions, as the Roman Ca|tholick,
Lutheran and Calvini&s;t,
but e&s;pecially betwixt the two lat|ter,
and therefore entertained <HI>Do|ctor
Duris</HI> at her court in <HI>Ca&s;&s;els</HI>
who wrote &s;everall pieces upon that
&s;ubject of reconciliation, and with
<PB N="143" REF="76">
&s;ome of his friends had a conference
with a learned prie&s;t that came from
Rome to forward the project; where|upon
the Doctor publi&s;hed his
book of the <HI>Harmoney of Con|&s;ent,</HI>
which is highly e&s;teemed in
Germany.</P>
<P>From this Princes court I dire|cted
my journey to <HI>Hanover,</HI> taking
<HI>Lamb&s;pring</HI> in my way, a place where
there is a convent of Engli&s;h Monks;
and there I met with a very aged
worthy and harmele&s;s Gentleman
St. <HI>Thomas Ga&s;coigue,</HI> a Per&s;on of
more integrity and pietie then to be
guilty, &s;o much as in thought, of
what mi&s;creants fal&s;ly &s;wore again&s;t
him in the licentions time of plot|ting;
the Lord Abbot and &s;everall
of the Monks I had &s;een there for|merly.
This mona&s;tery is very
obliging to all &s;trangers that travell
that way, as well as to theire own
Countreymen, and is highly re&s;pe|cted
by the neighbouring Princes
of all per&s;ua&s;ions, as the Princes
<PB N="144" REF="77">
of the hou&s;e of Lunenburg, the
Landgrave of He&s;&s;en, and Elector
of <HI>Cologne,</HI> who as Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hil|dersheim</HI>
is their ordinary. The
town of Lamb&s;pring is Lutheran
though under the government of
the Lord Abbot and his chapter, who
con&s;tantly choo&s;e Lutheran Magi|&s;trats
and Officers for the civill ad|mini&s;tration,
and live together in
that love and unitie, that as yet
there hath never the lea&s;t debate
happened among&s;t them; and indeed
this harmoney is now to be ob&s;er|ved
in mo&s;t parts of Germany where
different Religions are profe&s;&s;ed.
When I con&s;idered &s;o many goodly
faces both of Monks and &s;tudents
in that Abbey, I could not forbeare
to make a &s;erious reflexion on the
number of the Engli&s;h whom I had
&s;een in the colledges and Cloy&s;ters
abroad, as at <HI>Rome, Rattesbonne,
Wirtzburg</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> at <HI>Liege,
Louvain, Bru&s;&s;els, Dunkerk,
Ghent, Paris,</HI> and other places,
<PB N="145" REF="77">
be&s;ides the &s;everall Nunneries, and
withall on the lo&s;s that both King
and Kingdome &s;uffered thereby,
when &s;o many of our natives both
men and women &s;hould be con&s;trai|ned
to &s;pend their own E&s;tats and
the benevolence of others in a &s;trange

than at fir&s;t one may imagine;
and this thought, I confe&s;s, made
me wi&s;h it were otherwi&s;e. I would
not have the Reader to mi&s;take mee
here, as if I e&s;pou&s;ed, or pleaded
for any particular party; No, I
plead onely for the &s;entiments of
humanity, without which our nature
degenerates into that of brutes, and
for the love that every hone&s;t man
ought to have for his Countrey.
I am a&s;much a friend to the Spani&s;h
Inqui&s;ition, as to the per&s;ecuting
of tender Con&s;cienced prote&s;tants,
provided there be no more but
Con&s;cience in the ca&s;e; and I could

<PB N="146" REF="78">
in <HI>England</HI> as they doe in
<HI>Holland, Germany,</HI> and other Coun|tries;
for give mee leave to &s;ay it, I
love not that Religion which in &s;tead
of exulting, de&s;troys the Principles
of morality and humane &s;ocietie. I
have met with hone&s;t men of all per|&s;ua&s;ions,
even Turks and Jews,
who in their lives and manners have
far exceeded many of our Enthu|&s;ia&s;tick
profe&s;&s;ors at home; and when
ever this happened, I could not
forbeare to love the men with|out
embraceing there Religion,
for which they them&s;elves are to
account to their great ma&s;ter and
Judge.</P>
<P>In my progre&s;s towards <HI>Hanover</HI>
I touched at <HI>Hildersheim</HI> a city
who&s;e Magi&s;trates are Lutheran,
though Roman Catholicks have
the Cathedrall Church, and &s;everall
mona&s;teries there. The court of <HI>Ha|nover</HI>
makes another kind of figure
than that of <HI>Ca&s;&s;els,</HI> it being the
court of a greater Prince, who is
<PB N="147" REF="78">
Bi&s;hop of <HI>O&s;naburg,</HI> duke of <HI>Brun&s;|wick
Lunenburg, Hanover</HI> &amp;c.
Here I had the honour to ki&s;s the
hands of the Prince&s;s Royall <HI>Sophia</HI>
younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter to the late Prince
Rupert. Her highne&s;s has the
character of the <HI>Merry debonnaire
Prince&s;s</HI> of Germany, a lady of ex|traordinary
virtue and accompli&s;h|ments,
and mi&s;tri&s;s of the Italian,
French, High and low dutch and
Engli&s;h languages, which &s;he &s;peaks
to perfection. Her husband has
the title of the Gentlemen of <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
a gracefull and comely Prince
both a foot and on hor&s;eback, civill
to &s;trongers beyond compare, infi|nitely
Kind and beneficent to people
in di&s;tre&s;s, and known in the world
for a valiant and experienced Soldier.
I had the honour to &s;ee his troops
which without controver&s;ic are as
good men, and commanded by as
expert Officers as any are in Europe:
Among&s;t his Officers I found brave
<HI>Steel-hand Gordon</HI> Collonel of an
<PB N="148" REF="79">
Excellent Regiment of hor&s;e,
<HI>Grimes, Hamilton, Talbot</HI> and others
of our Kings &s;ubjects. God hath
ble&s;t the Prince with a numerous
off&s;pring, having &s;ix &s;ons all galant
Princes; of whom the two elde&s;t
&s;ignalized them&s;elves &s;o bravely at the
rai&s;ing of the &s;iege of <HI>Vienna,</HI> that
as an undoubted proofe of their
valour they brought three Turks
home to this court pri&s;oners. His
Elde&s;t &s;on is married to a mo&s;t
beautifull Prince&s;s &s;ole heire&s;s of the
duke of <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> and <HI>Zell</HI> his
elder brother; as the lovely Prin|ce&s;s
his daughter is lately married
to the Electorall Prince of Bran|denbourg.
He is a gracious Prince
to his people, and keeps a very
&s;plendid court, having in his &s;ta|bles
for the u&s;e of him&s;elf and chil|dren
no le&s;s than fifty two &s;ets of
coach hor&s;es. he him&s;elf is Luthe|ran,
but as his &s;ubjects are Chri|&s;tians
of different per&s;ua&s;ions, nay
and &s;ome of them Jews too, &s;o
<PB N="149" REF="79">
both in his court and army he en|tertains
Gentlemen of various opi|nions
and Countries, as Italian ab|bots,

but that he and his Children
goe many times to Church with the
Prince&s;s who is a Calvini&s;t, and
joine with her in her devotion.
His Countrey is good, having gold
and &s;ilver mines in it, and his &s;ub|jects
live well under him; as doe
tho&s;e al&s;o of his brother the duke
of <HI>Lunenbourg,</HI> and their Cozen the

the three Princes of the hou&s;e of
<HI>Lunenbourg;</HI> of whom it may be
&s;aid that they have alwayes &s;tuck
hone&s;tly to the right &s;ide, and be|friended
the intere&s;ts of the Em|pire;

honour nor profit, could ever pre|vail

<P><PB N="150" REF="80">
From this Princes court I went
to <HI>Zell</HI> the re&s;idence of the duke
the elder brother of the familie.
This Prince is called the mighty
<HI>Nimrod</HI> becaus of the great delight
he takes in hor&s;es, dogs and hunting.
He did mee the honour to let mee
&s;he his &s;tables, wherein he keeps 370
hor&s;es mo&s;t of them Engli&s;h, or of
Engli&s;h breed. His dogs which
are al&s;o Engli&s;h, are &s;o many, that
with great care they are quartered
in &s;everall apartments according to
their Kind and qualities, there being
a large office like a brewhou&s;e em|ployed
for boyling of malt and Corn
for them. It is this valiant Prince
who tooke <HI>Tieves</HI> from the French,
and made the <HI>Mareshall do Crequi</HI>

to &s;trangers, and hath &s;everall brave
Scotti&s;h Officers under his pay, as

others. His Lieutenant General is

better know'n in the world than the
encomium which that generous
Gentleman ingenuou&s;ly gave, and
which heere I &s;pare to relate. I &s;hall

better in my life.</P>
<P>After &s;ome &s;tay at the Court of
the duke of <HI>Zell</HI> I went to <HI>Ham|bourg</HI>
a famous Han&s;iatick town.
It is a republick and city of great
trade, occa&s;ioned partly by the
Engli&s;h Company of Merchant ad|ventures,
but much more by the
dutch Prote&s;tants who in the time
of the <HI>Duke of Alba</HI> for&s;ook the low
Countries and &s;eltled here, and
the Prote&s;tants al&s;o who were tur|ned
out of <HI>Cologne</HI> and other places
in Germany; who neverthele&s;s are
not now allowed publick Churches
within the citie, but at a place cal|led
<HI>Altena</HI> a village belonging to
the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> a quarter of
an houres walk di&s;tant from <HI>Ham|bourg.</HI>
This Commonwealth is
Lutheran and governed by four
<HI>Burgema&s;ters,</HI> twenty four <HI>Radts|heres,</HI>
and a common Council of
all the Burghers who have above
<PB N="153" REF="81">
40 &s;chellings <HI>per annum</HI> free hold.
The &s;ymbole or Motto under their
Armes is, <HI>da pacem domine in diebus
no&s;tris,</HI> and in their Standart are
the&s;e letters S. P. Q. H. The
people here grone under heavy tax|es
and impo&s;itions; The State be|caus
of continuall Alarms they have
from the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> or other
neighbours; and the inte&s;tine
broiles that frequently happen here,
as well as at <HI>Cologne,</HI> where the
Burgema&s;ters are often in danger of
their lives from the mutinous mo|bile;
being forced to maintain &s;ix
or &s;eaven thou&s;and men in pay, be|&s;ides
two or three men of war to
guard their havens from pirats. I
&s;hall not name all the wayes of im|po&s;ing
taxes which this Com|monwealth
u&s;es, becaus in mo&s;t
they imitate the methods of the
<HI>States Generall</HI> as to that, which
have bin mentioned before: I &s;hall
onely take notice of &s;ome peculiar
cu&s;tomes they have, wherein they
<PB N="154" REF="82">
differ from Holland. When a Bar|ber,
&s;hoe maker, or any other Ar|tizan
dies, leaving a widow and
Children, another of the &s;ame trade
is not admitted to &s;et up for him|&s;elf
as a ma&s;ter; unle&s;s he com|pound
with the widow for a piece
of money, or el&s;e marry her, or a
daughter of hers with her con|&s;ent.</P>
<P>If any man cau&s;e another to be
arre&s;ted for debt or upon any other
&s;uit, the plaintif mu&s;t goe along
with the Officer who arre&s;ts the
party and &s;tay by him untill the pri|&s;oner
be examined by the &s;heriff;
&s;o that if the &s;heriff be not to be
&s;poken with that night, the plaintiff
mu&s;t tarry with the pri&s;oner all
night, untill the &s;heriff examine
the matter, and &s;ee cau&s;e of di&s;|charging
or committing the party;
but this a plaintiff may doe by a pro|curation
Notariall.</P>
<P>If a pri&s;oner be committed for
debt, the plaintiff mu&s;t maintain
<PB N="155" REF="82">
him in pri&s;on according to his qua|litie:
and if the party lye in pri&s;on
during the &s;pace of &s;ix yeares, at
the expiration of that time the pri|&s;oner
is di&s;charged; and if during
the time of his impri&s;onment, the
plaintif doe not punctually pay the
pri&s;oners allowance at the months
end, the pri&s;oner is &s;et at liberty,
and neverthele&s;s the plaintiff mu&s;t
pay the Gailer the la&s;t months al|lowance.</P>
<P>This &s;tate is &s;evere in the execu|tion
of Ju&s;tice again&s;t thieves,
murders and cheats. There is
no pardon to be expected for mur|der,
and a Burgema&s;ter him&s;elf if
guilty cannot e&s;cape. The puni&s;h|ment
for Murder is here as in
<HI>Sweden,</HI> breaking malefactors on
the wheele, pinching their brea&s;ts
and Arms with hot Pincers, &s;peeting
them in at the fundament and out at
the &s;houlder, they have al&s;o cruel
wayes of torturing to make pri&s;oners
confe&s;s; And are very carefull not to
<PB N="156" REF="83">
be cheated in their publick revenue;
their acci&s;emen and collectors being
puni&s;hed as in <HI>Holland.</HI> They take
a very good cour&s;e not to be chea|ted
in their acci&s;e; for all the mils
of the Countrey are in the hands
the State; &s;o that no baker nor
brewer can grind his own corn, but
mu&s;t have it ground at the States
mills, where they pay the acci&s;e.
There is a Generall tax upon all
hou&s;es, and that is the Eight penny,
which neverthele&s;s does not excu&s;e
them from chimney money. The
States here as at <HI>Genoa</HI> in Italy are
the publick vintners, of whom all
people mu&s;t buy their wine, which
they buy from the Merchants, or
otherwi&s;e import it in their own
&s;hips. In their ceremonies of bu|rying
and Chri&s;tening, they are
ridiculou&s;ly prodigall; as for in|&s;tance.
If one invite a Burgema|&s;ter,
he mu&s;t give him a ducat in
gold, if a <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dtsheer,</HI> that is, an
Alderman, a Rixdollar, to every

Preacher, Doctor of Phy&s;ick, Ad|vocat
or Secretary halfe a Rixdollar,
and to every Schoolma&s;ter the third
part of a Rixdoller. The women
are the inviters to Burialls, wed|dings
and Chri&s;tenings, who weare
an Antick Kind of a dre&s;s, having
mitered caps as high again as the
Miter of a Bi&s;hop. The Churches
here are rich in revenues, and or|naments,
as Images and Stately
Organs wherein they much delight.
They are great lovers of Mu&s;ick;
in &s;o much that I have told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">5
ma&s;ters of &s;everall &s;orts of Mu&s;ick
in one Church, be&s;ides tho&s;e who
were in the Organ-gallery. Their
Organs are extraordinarely large.
I mea&s;ured the great pipes in the
Organs of St. <HI>Catharins</HI> and St.
<HI>James's</HI> Churches, and found them
to be 3 foot and 3 quarters in cir|cumference
and 32 foot long; in
each of which Organs there are two
Pipes 5 foot and 8 inches round.
The wealth and trade of this
<PB N="158" REF="84">
citie encrea&s;es dayly: They &s;end one
year with another 70 Ships to
Greenland, and have wonderfully
engro&s;&s;ed that trade from <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Holland,</HI> and it is beleeved
that &s;mall and great there are be|longing
to this Commonwealth five
thou&s;and &s;ayl of Ships. After <HI>Am|&s;terdam,
Genoa,</HI> and <HI>Venice</HI> their
bank is reckoned the chiefe in cre|dit;
but in trade they are accoun|ted
the third in Europe, and come
next to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Am&s;terdam.
Hambourg</HI> is now become the Ma|gazine
of Germany and of the bal|tick
and northern &s;eas. They give
great priviledges to the Jewes, and
to all &s;trangers what&s;oever, E&s;pe|cially
the Engli&s;h Company of
Merchant Adventures, whom they
allow a large building, where they
have a Church, and where the de|puty
governour, Secretary, Mi|ni&s;ter,
and the other Officers
of the Company live, to whom
they yearly make pre&s;ent of Wine,
<PB N="159" REF="84">
Beere, Sheep, Salmond and Stur|geon
in their &s;ea&s;ons. And &s;o much
of <HI>Hambourg.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Hambourg</HI> I went to <HI>Lu|beck,</HI>
which is al&s;o a Com|monwealth
and Imperiall town. It
is a large well built city contai|ning
ten pari&s;h Churches; the Ca|thedrall
dedicated to St. <HI>Peter</HI> being
in length 500 foot, with two high
&s;pires all covered with bra&s;s as the
re&s;t of the Churches of that city
are. In former times this city was
the place where the deputies of all
the Han&s;iatick towns a&s;&s;embled,
and was once &s;o powerfull as to make
war again&s;t <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI>
and to conquer &s;everall places and
I&s;lands belonging to tho&s;e two
Crowns, nay and to lend Ships to
England and other Potentates,
without any prejudice to their own
trade, wherein they vied in all parts
with their neighbours; but it is
now exceedingly run into decay not
onely in territories, but in wealth
<PB N="160" REF="85">
and trade al&s;o. And the rea&s;on of
that was chiefely the incon&s;iderate
zeal of their Lutheran Mini&s;ter&abus;
who per&s;waded the Magi&s;trates to
bani&s;h all Roman Catholicks,
Calvini&s;ts, Jews, and all that di&s;&s;en|ted
from them in matter of Reli|gion,
even the Engli&s;h Company
too, who all went and &s;etled in
<HI>Hambourg,</HI> to the great advantage
of that city and almo&s;t ruine of
<HI>Lubeck,</HI> which hath not now above
200 Ships belonging to it, nor
more territories to the State; than
the city it &s;elf and a &s;mall part cal|led
<HI>Termond</HI> about eight miles di|&s;tant
from it. The re&s;t of there ter|ritories
are now in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the <HI>Danes</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> by whom
the burghers are &s;o continually al|larmed,
that they are quite tired
out with keeping guard and paying
of Taxes. The city is indeed well
fortified; but the government not
being able to maintain above 1500
Soldiers in pay, 400 Eurghers
<PB N="161" REF="85">
in two Companies are obliged to
watch every day. They have a
large well built Stathou&s;e, and an
Exchange covered, on the top
whereof the globes of the world
are painted. This Exchange is
about fifty yards in the length; and
but fifteen in breadth; over it there
is a Roome where the skins of five
Lions which the Burghers killed at
the city gates in the year 1252 are
kept &s;tuft. The great market place
is very large where a monumentall
&s;tone is to be &s;een, on which one
of their Burgema&s;ters was beheaded
for running away without fighting
in a &s;ea engagement. The people
here &s;pend much time in their
Churches at devotion, which con|&s;i&s;ts
chiefely in &s;inging. The women
are beautifull but di&s;figured with
a kind of Antick dre&s;s; they wea|ring
cloaks like men. It is cheap
living in this town; for one may
hire a palace for a matter of 20
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> a year, and have provi&s;ions at

very rea&s;onable rates: be&s;ides the air

wants; and good ground for cel|lerage,
there being cellars here fourty

<P>I had the curio&s;ity to goe from

<PB N="163" REF="86">
in <HI>England</HI> as it is in <HI>France,</HI>
the which I tould him was a great

admitted, and received into his

&amp; allowed the free exerci&s;e
of their owne forme of wor&s;hip, ac|cording

be Ignorant, that the chiefe&s;t part,

<P>Having made this digre&s;&s;ion, I return
to <HI>Berlin,</HI> It is a city lately enlarged
with fair &s;treets and palaces. The
Magi&s;trates of the place are Luthe|rans,
which is the publick e&s;tabli|&s;hed
Religion in all the Electors
dominions; though he him&s;elf and
his Children be Calvini&s;ts. He is
lookt upon to be &s;o true to that
per&s;ua&s;ion, that he is reckoned the
Protector of the Calvini&s;ts; and
indeed he &s;ollicited the Emperour
very hard for a toleration of the
Prote&s;tants in Hungary. His cha|plains,
as mo&s;t of the Lutheran
mini&s;ters al&s;o, endeavour to imi|tate
the Engli&s;h in their way of
preaching: and his highne&s;s is &s;o
<PB N="168" REF="89">
much taken with Engli&s;h divinity,
that he entertains divines for trans|lating
Engli&s;h books into the Ger|man
tongue, as <HI>the whole duty of
man</HI> and &s;everall others. He has a
large and Srately palace at <HI>Berlin</HI> and
therein a copious library enriched
with many manu&s;cripts, medalls,
and rarities of Antiquity. He may
compare with mo&s;t Princes for hand|&s;ome
guards, being all of them
proper well bodied men, and mo&s;t
part Officers who ride in his guards
of hor&s;e. As he is know'n in the
world to be a valiant and warlick
Prince, &s;o he maintains in pay an
Army of 36000 men; be&s;ides five or
&s;ix thou&s;and hor&s;men, who in time
of war are modelled into troopes;
with which body during the late
war with <HI>Sweden,</HI> his highne&s;s in
Per&s;on beat the <HI>Swedes</HI> out of his
Countrey. Hee keeps his forces
in &s;trickt Di&s;cipline, obliging all the
Officers, if Prote&s;tants, on Sun|days
and holy days to march their &s;e|verall
<PB N="169" REF="89">
Companies in order to
Church, but if a &s;uperiour Offi|cer
be of a contrary per&s;ua&s;ion,
then the next in commi&s;&s;ion &s;upplies
his place. This cu&s;tome is Reli|giou&s;ly
ob&s;erved by all his highne&s;|&s;es
garri&s;ons; while&s;t he him&s;elf
with his Children, being five &s;ons,
two Daughters, and two Daugh|ters
in law, goe con&s;tantly to the
Calvini&s;t Church adjoyning to the
Court. Among&s;t other acts of pu|blick
pietie and charitie, this Prince
hath e&s;tabli&s;hed and endowed &s;ome
Religious hou&s;es or Nunneries for
Prote&s;tant young ladies, where they
may live virtuou&s;ly and &s;pend their
time in devotion as long as they
plea&s;e, or otherwi&s;e marry, if they
think fit, but then they lo&s;e the be|nefit
of the Mona&s;tery. There is
one of the&s;e at <HI>Herford</HI> in We&s;t|phalia,
where I was and had the
honour to wait upon the Lady Ab|be&s;s
the Prince&s;s <HI>Eli&s;abeth,</HI> elde&s;t

<PB N="170" REF="90">
Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who is &s;ince dead.
Notwith&s;tanding the late wars with
<HI>Sweden</HI> and that by the prevalency
of <HI>France</HI> in that ha&s;ty treaty of
peace concluded at <HI>Nimwegen,</HI> his
Electorall Highne&s;s was obliged to
give back what he had Ju&s;tly taken
from that crown; yet his &s;ubjects
flouri&s;h in wealth and trade, his
highne&s;s having encouraged manu|factures
of all &s;orts, by inviting Ar|tizans
into his dominions, and e&s;ta|li&s;hed
a Company of tradeing Mer|chants
to the We&s;t-Indies, which
will much advance navigation a|mong&s;t
his &s;ubjects. And in all
humane probabilitie they are like to
continue in a happy condition, &s;eing
by the alliances his highne&s;s hath
made with the Prote&s;tant Princes of
the Empire, and e&s;pecially the hou&s;e
of <HI>Lunenbourg,</HI> they are in no danger
of being di&s;turbed by their neigh|bours.
I told you before that the
Prince of <HI>Brandenbourg</HI> was married
to the Daughter of the duke of
<PB N="171" REF="90">
<HI>Hanover,</HI> &s;o that &s;o long as that al|liance
holds, the families of <HI>Bran|denbourg</HI>
and <HI>Lunenbourg</HI> will be
in a condition to ca&s;t the ballance
of the Empire; they both together
being able to bring into the field
80000 as good men as any are in
Europe.</P>
<P>When I parted from <HI>Berlin</HI> I
made a turn back to <HI>Lunenbourg</HI>
in my way to Swedland, where I
found &s;everall of my Countrey men
Officers in the gari&s;on, who &s;hew'd
mee what was mo&s;t remarkeable in
the city, as the Saltworks (which
bring in con&s;iderable &s;ummes of
money to the duke of <HI>Lunen|bourg)</HI>
the Stathou&s;e, and Churches,
in one of which I &s;aw a communion
table of pure ducat gold. From
thence I went into the Province of
of <HI>Hol&s;tein,</HI> and at a &s;mall &s;ea port
called <HI>Termond,</HI> of which I &s;pake,
before, I embarked for <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>He that hath read in the hi&s;tories
of this la&s;t age the great exploits of
<PB N="172" REF="91">
<HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> and his <HI>Swedes,</HI>
perhaps may have a fancy that it
mu&s;t be an excellent Countrey which
hath bred&s;uch warriours; but if he
approach it, he will &s;oon find him|&s;elf
undeceived. Entering into
<HI>Sweedland</HI> at a place called <HI>Lands|ort,</HI>
wee &s;ailed forwards among&s;t
high rocks having no other pro&s;pect
from Land but mountains till wee
came to <HI>Dollers,</HI> which is about
four Swedi&s;h, that is, twenty four
Engli&s;h miles from <HI>Stockholm,</HI> the
capitall citie of the Kingdome: upon
my comeing a &s;hore I confe&s;s I
was a litle &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the
poverty of the people; and the
litle wooden hou&s;es they lived in,
not unlike Soldiers huts in a leaguer;
but much more, when I di&s;cove|red
litle el&s;e in the Countrey but
mountanous rocks and &s;tanding
lakes of water. The Reader will
excu&s;e mee, I hope, if I remarke
not all that I may have taken no|tice
of in this Countrey, &s;eing by
<PB N="173" REF="91">
what I have already written, he may
perceive that my de&s;igne is rather
to ob&s;erve the manner of the inha|bitants
living, then to give a full
de&s;cription of every thing that may
be &s;een in the Countrey they live in.
However I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omewhat of
that too, having premi&s;ed once
for all that the ordinary people are
wretchedly poor; yet not &s;o much
occa&s;ioned by the Publick taxes,
as the barrenne&s;s of their Countrey,
and the oppre&s;&s;ion of the nobles
their Landlords, and immediate &s;u|periours,
who till the pre&s;ent King
put a &s;top to their violences, ty|rannically
domineered over the
lives and fortunes of the poor pea|&s;ants.
From <HI>Dollers</HI> I took waggon
to <HI>Stockholm,</HI> changing hor&s;es three
times by the way, by rea&s;on of the
badne&s;s of the rode, on all hands
environed with rocks, that hardly
open &s;o much as here and there to
leave a &s;hred of plain ground. At
two miles di&s;tance upon that rode
<PB N="174" REF="92">
the citie of <HI>Stockholme</HI> looks great;
becaus of the Kings palace, the hou|&s;es
of Noblemen, and &s;ome Chur|ches
which are &s;eated upon rocks;
and indeed, the whole citie and
&s;uburbs &s;tand upon rocks, unle&s;s it
be &s;ome few hou&s;es built upon
ground gained from the rivers that
run throw the town. <HI>Stockholme</HI>
has its name from a &s;tock or logg
of wood which three brothers threw
into the water five miles above the
city, making a vow that where
ever that &s;tock &s;hould &s;top, they
would build a ca&s;tle to dwell in.
The &s;tock &s;topt at the Holme or
rock where the palace of the King
now &s;tands; and the brothers to
be as good as their word, there
built their ca&s;tle, which invited
others to doe the like; &s;o that in
proce&s;s of time the other rocks or
holmes were covered with buildings
which at length became the capital
citie of the Kingdome. It is now
embelli&s;hed with a great many
<PB N="175" REF="92">
Stately hou&s;es, and much emproved
from what it was 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">0 yeares agoe,
as indeed, mo&s;t cities are; for the
Stathou&s;e then built, is &s;o con|temtible
and low that in <HI>Hol|land</HI>
or <HI>England,</HI> it would not be
&s;uffered to &s;tand to di&s;grace the na|tion.
The Council Chamber where
the Burgema&s;ter and <HI>Raedt</HI> &s;it, is
two rooms ca&s;t into one not above
nine foot high; and the two rooms
where the &s;heriffs and the Erve col|ledge
(which is a Judicature like to
the <HI>Doctors Commons</HI> in England) &s;it
are not above eight foot and a halfe
high. The Kings Palace is a large
&s;quare of &s;tone building, in &s;ome
places very high, but an old and
irregular fabrick, without a &s;uffi|cient
quantitie of ground about it
for gardens and walks. It was an|ciently
&s;urrounded with water; but
&s;ome yeares &s;ince part of it was filled
up to make a way from the ca&s;tlegate
down into the old town. In this
Palace there are large rooms; but
<PB N="176" REF="93">
the lodgings of the King, Queen
and Royall familie are three pair of
&s;tairs high, the rooms in the fir&s;t and
&s;econd &s;tory's being de&s;tin'd for the
Senat Chamber and other courts of
Judicature. The Kings library is
four pair of &s;tairs high, being a room
about fourty &s;ix foot &s;quare, with
a clo&s;et adjoyning to it not half the
dimen&s;ions. When I con&s;idered
the appartments and furniture of
this Court, I began to think that
the French Author wrote truth, who
in his Remarks upon Swedland &s;ayes,
that when Queen <HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> re&s;igned
the Crown to <HI>Carolus Gu&s;taphus</HI> the
father of this pre&s;ent King, &s;he
di&s;po&s;ed of the be&s;t of the furniture
of the Court, and gave away a large
&s;hare of the Crown lands to her favo|rites;
in &s;o much that the King
con&s;idering the poor condition &s;he
had left the Kingdome in, and
&s;eeing the Court &s;o meanely furni|&s;hed,
&s;aid that had he know'n be|fore
he accepted the Crown, what
<PB N="177" REF="93">
then he did, he would have taken
other mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>There are many other Stately pa|laces
in <HI>Stockholme</HI> belonging to the
nobilitie; but many of them for
want of repairs, and not being inhabi|ted
run to ruine; &s;everall of the
nobles who lived in them formerly,
having lo&s;t the e&s;tates that maintai|ned
their ancient &s;plendour, as wee
&s;hall &s;ee hereafter, being retired
unto a Countrey life. There are
al&s;o &s;ome other magnificent &s;tru|ctures
begun, but not fini&s;hed, as
that Stately building intended for
a Parliament hou&s;e for the nobles,
and two or three Churches: but
what I mo&s;t wonder at is the vault
wherein the late King lies buried, is
not as yet covered but with boards,
for it is to he ob&s;erved that the Kings
of <HI>Sweeden</HI> have no tombs and
monuments as in England and other
Countries; but are put into copper
coffins with in&s;criptions on them,
and placed one by another in vaults
<PB N="178" REF="94">
adjoyning to the Gray Friers Church.
The&s;e vaults are about Eight in num|ber,
having turets over them with
vains of Copper gilt, carved into
the ciphers of the &s;everall Kings
who give them their names by being
the fir&s;t that are interred in them.
The vault of the late King is not
yet fini&s;hed, no more then the fa|bricks
above mentioned, which per|haps
may be imputed to the late
troubles of <HI>Swedland.</HI> The num|ber
of the inhabitants of <HI>Stockholme</HI>
are al&s;o much decrea&s;ed within the&s;e
few yeares, partly by rea&s;on of the
removal of the Court of Admiraltie
and the Kings Ships from that citie to
<HI>Charles-crown,</HI> a new haven lately
made about 200 Engli&s;h miles from
thence, which hath draw'n many
families belonging to the fleet and
Admiralitie from <HI>Stockholme</HI> to live
there: and partly becaus many of
the nobilitie, gentry and tho&s;e that
depended on them, are, as I &s;aid
before, withdraw'n from <HI>Stock|holme</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="94">
to a retired life in the Coun|trey.
Neverthele&s;s the ordinary
&s;ort of Bourghers who &s;till remain
are extreamly poor; &s;eing the women
are fain to worke like hor&s;es, drawing
carts, and as labourers in England,
&s;erving ma&s;ons and bricklayers with
&s;tone, bricks and mortar, and unloa|ding
ve&s;&s;ells that bring tho&s;e mate|rials;
&s;ome of the poor creatures in the
&s;ummertime toyling in their &s;mocks
without either &s;hoes or &s;tockings.
They performe al&s;o the part of wa|termen,
and for a &s;mall matter will
row pa&s;&s;engers 40 miles or more if
they plea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Court here is very thin and
&s;ilent, the King living frugally &amp; &s;el|dome
dining in publick He eats
commonly with <HI>the two Queens</HI>
his mother and con&s;ort, who is a
virtuous Prince&s;s &s;i&s;ter to the King
of Denmark. She is the mother of
five Children, three &s;ons and two
daughters, with whom &s;he &s;pends
mo&s;t of her time in retirement. The
<PB N="180" REF="95">
King is a goodly Prince whom God
hath ble&s;&s;ed and endowed with ac|compli&s;hments
far beyond what
might have been expected from his
education, wherein he was ex|treamly
abu&s;ed, being taught litle
more than his mother tongue. He
is gracious, Ju&s;t and valiant, con|&s;tant
at his devotion, and utterly
aver&s;e from all kind of debauchery,
and the unfa&s;hionable vanities of
other courts in playes, and danceing.</P>
<P>His Sports are hunting and exer|ci&s;eing
of his guards, and he rarely
appeares publickly or gives audience
to &s;trangers, which is imputed to
his &s;en&s;e of the neglect of his edu|cation.
He is a Prince that hath
had a very hard beginning in the
world, which hath many times
proved fortunate to great men; and
indeed, if wee con&s;ider all the cir|cum&s;tances
of his early mi&s;fortunes,
how he was &s;lighted and neglected
by his nobles who would hardly
vouch&s;afe to pay him a vi&s;it when he
<PB N="181" REF="95">
was among them in the Countrey,
or to doe him homage for the lands
they held of the Crown; and how
by the Pernicious councels of the
French and the weakene&s;s or trea|chery
of his governours he was
mi&s;led into a war that almo&s;t co&s;t
him his Crown, having lo&s;t the
be&s;t of his territories in <HI>Germany</HI>
and <HI>Schonen,</HI> and mo&s;t of his for|ces
both by &s;ea and land: If I &s;ay,
the&s;e things be con&s;idered, it will
probably appeare that hardly any
Prince before him hath in a &s;horter
time or more fully &s;etled the Au|thority
and prerogative of the
Crown, then he hath done in <HI>Swe|den;</HI>
for which he &s;tands no wayes
obliged to France, as he was for the
re&s;tauration of what he lo&s;t during
the war. He is now as ab&s;olute as
the French King, and makes Edicts
which have the force of Laws with
out the concurrence of the E&s;tates
of the Kingdome. He hath erected
two Iudicatures the one called the
<PB N="182" REF="96">
colledge of Reduction, and the
other of in&s;pections; the fir&s;t of
which hath put his Maje&s;ty in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
again of all lands alienated
from the Crown, and the other
called to account all per&s;ons even
the heires and executors of tho&s;e
who had cheated the Crown, and
made them <HI>refound</HI> what they or
their predece&s;&s;ors had appropriated
to their own u&s;e of the Publick re|venue.
The&s;e two nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;titutions,
as they have reduced
many great families to a pinch, who
formerly lived &s;plendidly upon the
Crown lands and revenues, and
obliged them to live at home upon
their ancient and private Patrimonie
in the Countrey, which is one great
cau&s;e that the Court of <HI>Sweden</HI> is
at pre&s;ent &s;o unfrequented; &s;o have
they enabled his Maje&s;tie, without
burdening of his &s;ubjects, to &s;up|port
the Charges of the govern|ment,
and to maintain 64000 men
in pay. The truth is his other Re|nues
<PB N="183" REF="96">
are but &s;mall, &s;eing Queen
<HI>Chri&s;tina</HI> enjoys the be&s;t of his ter|ritories,

what ari&s;es from the Copper and
Iron mines, one Silver mine, the
Pitch and Tar, the cu&s;tomes and
exci&s;e amounts to no extraordinary
&s;umm of money, &amp; the land tax in
&s;o barren a Countrey &s;carcely de|&s;erving
to be named. The cu&s;tomes
and exci&s;e, I confe&s;s, are very high,
and the rigorous manner of exa|cting
them pernicious to trade; as for
in&s;tance. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> a &s;hip come to <HI>Stock|holme</HI>

kept under very &s;trick di&s;cipline,

guards hor&s;e or foot but one, and
the &s;on of <HI>Sr. Eduard</HI> wood, who
hath &s;ince quitted the &s;ervice. The
King hath exceedingly won the
hearts of the common people, not
onely by exempting them from the
tyrannical Juri&s;diction of the nobi|litie
and gentry, who formerly would
by their own private authority pu|ni&s;h
and put to death the pea&s;ants
at their plea&s;ure; which makes the
Countries very willing to quarter the
<PB N="187" REF="98">
Kings Soldiers, but by his exactne&s;s
in puni&s;hing duels, murder and rob|beries.
Perjury is death here al&s;o
as in Holland: which makes the
Magi&s;trates in &s;ome ports of this
Kings territories enjoyns &s;trange
kinds of oaths to deter men from
being for&s;worn. As for in&s;tance,
in &s;ome places, the witne&s;s is &s;et,
with a &s;taff in his hand, upon &s;ome
peeble &s;tones and charcoale, where
he is to imprecate and pray, that
if what he &s;weareth be not true,
his land may become as barren as
tho&s;e &s;tones, and his &s;ub&s;tance be
con&s;umed to a&s;hes like the coals he
&s;tands on, which as &s;oon as he
&s;teps down are &s;et on fire. This
manner of &s;wearing &s;o terrifies
the people, that they commonly
tremble when they come to take
their oath.</P>
<P>The Religion of the dominions
of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as of tho&s;e
of the King of Denmark, and of
other Princes and &s;tates whom wee
<PB N="188" REF="99">
have named is Lutheran; who are
more rigid to Roman Catho|licks
and Calvini&s;ts than the Pro|te&s;tanrs
of Germany. There is no
tolleration allowed here to Calvi|ni&s;t
mini&s;ters; and they take an ef|fectuall
cour&s;e to keep the Countrey
clear of prie&s;ts and Je&s;uits, by guel|ding
them whether they be young
or old. In commemoration of the
great lo&s;&s;es and de&s;olation iu&s;tained
in the late war, the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;trictly
keep four fa&s;ting days in the months
of <HI>April, May, June</HI> and <HI>July;</HI> on
which days all men are prohibited
by Authority to kindle fire in their
hou&s;es, or to eat till after Evening
&s;ervice is don, which in the winter
time could not be endured. They
delight much in &s;inging in their
Churches, which they con&s;tantly
performe twice every day, morning,
and evening. In their maryings,
Chri&s;tenings and buryings they are
&s;o prodigally extravagant, that if
all three happen in one yeare to a
<PB N="189" REF="99">
man of a competent e&s;tate, it is
enough to breake him, The clergy
of <HI>Sweden</HI> are neither &s;o rich nor
learned as tho&s;e of Germany, wan|ting
both the opportunities of &s;tudy,
and of conver&s;ing with learned men,
that tho&s;e of other Countreys en|joy;
though there be &s;ome learned
men among&s;t them. A Bi&s;hoprick
in <HI>Sweden</HI> is no great benefice, if
compared with &s;ome Per&s;onages in
England; for the Archbi&s;hop and
Metropolitan hath not above 400
L. <HI>per ann.</HI> and &s;ome of the re&s;t are
not worth above 150 or 200 L. a
yeare. The inferiour Clergy are
not &s;o regular in their lives and
conver&s;ation in the Countries di|&s;tant
from <HI>Stockholme,</HI> as they are
neare the court, and the rea&s;on is,
partly becaus they entertain tra|vellers
that pa&s;s the Countrey, there
being no Ins in mo&s;t places for the
accommodation of per&s;ons of any
qualitie, and &s;o are obliged to drink
with their gue&s;ts: and partly becaus
<PB N="190" REF="100">
at buryings and Chri&s;tenings, where
there is commonly high drinking,
the Pape or Par&s;on is ma&s;ter of the
Ceremonies; And here give mee
leave, to tell a &s;hort &s;tory of one
of them. A Pape comeing to Chri|&s;ten
a Child in a Church, and find|ing
a Scotti&s;h man to be Godfa|ther,
was &s;o tran&s;ported either with
Zeal or his cups, that when he came
to exorci&s;e the Child which is a rite
u&s;ed in their Office of Admini&s;tring
that Sacrament, He neglected the
forme pre&s;cribed by the liturgie, and
in an extemporary prayer begg'd
that the devill might depart out of
the Child, and enter into that
Scotti&s;h Heretick; for &s;o they call
the Presbyterians of that nation.
The prayer of the Pape &s;o incen&s;ed
the Scot that he vowed revenge,
and watched the Pape with a good
cudgell next day as he cro&s;&s;ed the
Church yard, where he beat him
and left him all in blood lying on
the ground and crying out murder.
<PB N="191" REF="100">
For this fact the Scot was had before
the Ju&s;tice, who asking him how
he dur&s;t be &s;o bold as to lay his pro|fane
hands upon the man of God,
He, who knew very well what u&s;e
to make of the devill he had got,
foaming at the mouth and cunningly
acting the demoniack, made an|&s;wer
that the Pape might thank
him&s;elf for what he had met with;
for &s;ince he had conjured the devill
into him he &s;pared no body, nei|ther
wife nor Children, nor would
he &s;pare the Ju&s;tice him&s;elf, and
with that &s;ell a mangling and tearing
the Magi&s;trat, that he was fain to
betake him&s;elf to his heeles, crying
out <HI>O! the devill, &s;ave mee;</HI> and
&s;o the Scot marched home no man
daring to lay hold on him, for fear
of being torn to peeces by the de|vill.
But the Ju&s;tice recollecting
him&s;elf &s;ent for the Pape, told him
that the Scot was a cunning rogue,
and bid him goe home, get a plai|&s;ter
for his head and be &s;ilent; lea&s;t
<PB N="192" REF="101">
if the matter came to the Bi&s;hops
ears, he might be cen&s;ured for
goeing again&s;t the rubrick of the
liturgie.</P>
<P>The famous Univer&s;itie where
their Clergy are bred is <HI>&V;p&s;all</HI> eight
Swedi&s;h miles from <HI>Stockholme.</HI>
There are commonly 150 or 200
Students there, but no endowed
colledges as in other Countries.
The library is &s;o meane and con|temptible
that the libraries of many
Grammar Schools and of privat
men in England or Holland are
far better &s;tored with books then it
is. Upon viewing of it, and that of
the Kings Palace, I called to mind
the &s;aying of a French man, upon
the like occa&s;ion; That <HI>Swedland</HI>
came behind <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England</HI>
in the knowledge of men and things
at lea&s;t 800 yeares; yet &s;ome <HI>Swedes</HI>
have been &s;o conceited of the an|tiquity
of their Countrey, as to
bragg that Paradice was &s;eated in
<HI>Sweden,</HI> that the Countrey was
<PB N="193" REF="101">
turned into &s;uch heaps of rocks for
the rebellion of our fir&s;t parents,
and that <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> had <HI>Cain</HI>
and <HI>Abel</HI> in a Countrey three <HI>Swe|dish</HI>
miles di&s;tant from <HI>&V;p&s;all.</HI> A
French man &s;tanding by and hearing
this Romantick &s;tory, as I was
told, fitted him with the like, tel|ling
him that when the world was
made in &s;ix days, at the end of the
creation all the Rubbi&s;h that re|mained
was throw'n together into
a corner, which made up <HI>Sweden</HI>
and Norway. And indeed the
French &s;eeme to have no great like|ing
to the Countrey, what ever
kindne&s;s they may have for the peo|ple,
for a French Amba&s;&s;adour, as
an author of that Countrey relates,
being by order of Queen Chri&s;tina
treated in a Countrey hou&s;e 4
Swedi&s;h miles from <HI>Stockholme,</HI>
and upon the rode goeing and co|meing,
with all the varieties and
plea&s;ures that the Countrey could
affoard, on purpo&s;e to make him
<PB N="194" REF="102">
have a good opinion of the &s;ame;
made an&s;were to the Queen (who
asked him upon his return what he
thought of <HI>Sweden)</HI> that were he
ma&s;ter of the whole Countrey, he
would pre&s;ently &s;ell it &amp; buy a farme
in France or England; which, under
favour, I think was a litle tart and
&s;awcy.</P>
<P>Having &s;tayed a con&s;iderable time
in Swedland, and mo&s;t part at <HI>Stock|holme,</HI>
I &s;et out from thence to goe
to <HI>El&s;enbourg</HI> by land, and went a
litle out of my way to &s;ee a &s;mall
city called <HI>Eubrone</HI> famous for a coat
of Arms which it got in this manner.
A certain Ma&s;culine Queen of
<HI>Denmark</HI> who had conquered a
great part of <HI>Sweden,</HI> comeing to
this city, asked the Magi&s;trates,
what was the Arms of their city;
who having told her that they had
none, &s;he plucked up her coats and
&s;quatting upon the Snow, bid them
take the marke &s;he left there for their
Arms: It's pity &s;he did not give them
<PB N="195" REF="102">
a &s;uitable motto to it al&s;o. What
that figure is called in blazonerie
I know not, but to this day the
city u&s;es it in their Armes, and for
marking their commodities. This
Queen came purpo&s;ely into <HI>Swe|den</HI>
to pay a vi&s;it to a brave woman
that oppo&s;ed a King of <HI>Swedland,</HI>
who in a time of famine would have
put to death all the men and women
in his Countrey above &s;ixty years
of age. The Countrey all the way
I travelled in <HI>Swedland</HI> is much of
the &s;ame qualitie of the land about
<HI>Stockholme,</HI> untill I came neare the
Province of <HI>Schonen</HI> which is cal|led
the &s;tore hou&s;e and Kitchin
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> where the Countrey is
far better. It was formerly very
dangerous to travell in this Pro|vince
of <HI>Schonen,</HI> becaus of the
Snaphances who were a kind of
bloody robbers, now utterly de|&s;troyed
by the King; &s;o that it is
&s;afe enough travelling there. En|tering
into <HI>Schonen</HI> I &s;aw twenty nine
<PB N="196" REF="103">
of the&s;e rogues upon wheeles, and
el&s;ewhere in the Countrey, ten and
twenty at &s;everall places. The
King u&s;ed great &s;everitie in de&s;troy|ing
of them; &s;ome he cau&s;ed to be
broken upon the wheele, others
&s;peeted in at the fundament and out
at the &s;houlders, many had the fle&s;h
pinched off of there brea&s;ts, and &s;o
were fa&s;tened to &s;takes till they died,
and others again had their no&s;es and
both hands cut off, and being &s;ea|red
with a hot Iron were let goe to
acquaint their camerades how they
had been &s;erved. The King is very
&s;evere again&s;t Highway-men and
duellers. In above a hundred
miles travelling, wee found not a
hou&s;e where there was either French
wine or brandie, which made mee
tell a <HI>Swede</HI> of our Company who
was travelling to Denmark, that I
would undertake to &s;hew any man
500 hou&s;es wherein a traveller
might have wine and other good
accommodation in the &s;pace of an
<PB N="197" REF="103">
hundred miles upon any rode from
<HI>London.</HI> There are &s;everall &s;mall
towns and fertile land in this Coun|trey
of <HI>Schonen,</HI> lying upon the
<HI>Sound;</HI> at the narrowe&s;t part
whereof lies <HI>El&s;enbourg</HI> burnt down
by the Danes in the la&s;t war:
Here I cro&s;t over to <HI>El&s;enore,</HI>
the pa&s;&s;age being but a league
broad.</P>
<P>The King of Denmark has a ca&s;tle
at <HI>El&s;enore</HI> which commands the
narrow pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Sound,</HI> where
all Ships that enter into or come
out of the Baltick &s;ea mu&s;t pay
toll. Having vi&s;ited this ca&s;tle
and &s;tai'd about a fortnight with
the Engli&s;h Con&s;ul, and <HI>Sr.
John Paul</HI> late re&s;ident at the
Court of <HI>Swedland,</HI> I went to
the dani&s;h Court at <HI>Coppenha|guen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Copenhaguen</HI> is the capitall city
of <HI>Zeeland, Jutland</HI> or <HI>Denmark</HI>
and place of re&s;idence of the King
It &s;tands on a flat, encompa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="198" REF="104">
with a plea&s;ant and delightfull Coun|trey
much re&s;embling England. The
&s;treets of the city are kept very neat
and cleane, with lights in the night
time for the convenience and &s;afe|tie
of tho&s;e who are then abroad;
a cu&s;tome not as yet introduced
into <HI>Stockholme</HI> where it is dange|rous
to be abroad when it is dark.
The Kings men of war lye here
very conveniently, being orderly
ranged betwixt <HI>Booms</HI> after the
manner of Am&s;terdam, and neare
the Admiralty hou&s;e, which is a
large pile of building well furni&s;hed
with &s;tores and Magazines, &s;ecured
by a citadell, that not onely com|mands
the city, but al&s;o the Haven,
and entrey into it. The Court of
Denmark is &s;plendid, and makes
a far greater figure in the world
then that of <HI>Sweden,</HI> tho not many
yeares agoe in the time of <HI>Carolus
Gu&s;taphus</HI> the father of the pre&s;ent
King of <HI>Swedland,</HI> it was almo&s;t
reduced to its la&s;t, when the walls
<PB N="199" REF="104">
of <HI>Copenhagen</HI> &s;aved that Crown
and Kingdome. That &s;iege was
famous, caried on with great
vigour by the <HI>Swede,</HI> and as bravely
maintained by the <HI>Danes:</HI> The
monuments whereof are to be &s;een
in the canon bullets gilt that &s;till
remain in the walls of &s;ome hou&s;es
and in the &s;teeple of the great Church
of the town. The Royall palace in
<HI>Copenhaguen</HI> is but &s;mall and a very
ancient building, but his Maje&s;ties
hou&s;e <HI>Fredenburg</HI> is a &s;tately fa|brick
of Modern Architecture, and
very richly furni&s;hed. <HI>Denmark</HI>
is at pre&s;ent a flouri&s;hing Kingdome
and the King who hath now made
it hereditary, &s;urpa&s;&s;es mo&s;t of his
predece&s;&s;ours in power and wealth:
He hath much enlarged his domi|nions,
a&s;well as Authority, and by
his per&s;onall and Royall virtues,
no le&s;s then the eminent qualities of
a great many able mini&s;ters of State,
he hath gained the univer&s;all love
of his &s;ubjects, and the e&s;teeme of
<PB N="200" REF="105">
all forreigne Princes and States.
The Court if much frequented eve|ry
day, but e&s;pecially on Sundays
where about eleven of the clock in
the morning, the Nobility, for|reigne
Mini&s;ters, and Officers of
the Army a&s;&s;emble and make a glo|rious
appeareance. There one may
&s;ee many Knights of the order of the
Elephant of <HI>Malto</HI> but I never &s;aw
any order of the like nature as that of
<HI>Sweden,</HI> that King rarely appearing
in his George and garter, but on
days of publick audience I have
ob&s;erved at one time above 150
coaches attending at the Court of
Denmark, which are ten times more
than ever I &s;aw together at that
of <HI>Sweden.</HI> The King is affable
and of ea&s;y accels to &s;trangers, &s;een
often abroad by his &s;ubjects in his
gardens and &s;tables, which are very
large and well furni&s;hed with all
&s;orts of Hor&s;es. He is a great lover
of Engli&s;h hor&s;es and dogs, and
delights much in Hunting, as his
<PB N="201" REF="105">
elde&s;t &s;on the Prince with his bro|thers
doe in cockfighting; in &s;o
much that the Engli&s;h Merchants
can not make a more acceptable pre|&s;ent
to tho&s;e Princes, then of En|gli&s;h
game-cocks. The &s;tanding for|ces
of <HI>Denmark</HI> are well di&s;ciplined
men, and commanded by good
Officers both natives and &s;tran|gers,
both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> as
Major General <HI>Duncan,</HI> and Major
General <HI>Veldun</HI> both Scotti&s;h|men,
whom I &s;aw at <HI>Copenhaguen.</HI>
The Soldiers, a&s;well as courtiers are
quartered upon the citizens, a cu|&s;tome
which is likewi&s;e practi&s;ed in
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and tho &s;omewhat unea&s;y,
yet not repined at by the people
who by the care and good govern|ment
of the King find trade much
advanced. For his Maje&s;tie by en|couraging
&s;trangers of all religions
to live in his dominions, and allow|ing
the French and dutch Calvini&s;ts,
to have publick Churches, hath
brought many tradeing families to
<PB N="202" REF="106">
<HI>Coppenhaguen,</HI> and by the mea&s;ure
he hath taken for &s;ettling trade in
prohibiting the importation of for|reigne
manufactures, and reforming
and new modelling the Ea&s;t and
We&s;t India Companies, hath much
encrea&s;ed commerce and thereby
the wealth of his &s;ubjects; &s;o that
notwith&s;tanding the new taxes im|po&s;ed
upon all coaches, waggons,
Ploughs, and all reall and per&s;o|nall
e&s;tates, which amount to con|&s;iderable
&s;umms of money, the
people live very well and conten|ted.
There are commonly about
eight thou&s;and men in gari&s;on in
<HI>Coppenhaguen,</HI> and his Maje&s;ties Re|giment
of foot guards who are all
cloathed in red, with cloaks to keep
them warm in the winter time, is
a very hand&s;ome body of men, and
with the hor&s;e guards who are
bravely mounted, and have their gra|nadeers
and Hoboyes, make a very
fine &s;hew. His Maje&s;tie hath cau|&s;ed
&s;everall new fortifications to be
<PB N="203" REF="106">
built upon the <HI>Elb,</HI> and other rivers,
and hath now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion that
&s;trong Ca&s;tle called <HI>Hilgueland,</HI>
at pre&s;ent commanded by a Scotti&s;h|man.
The Queen of <HI>Denmark</HI> is a
mo&s;t virtuous Prince&s;s, &s;i&s;ter to
the pre&s;ent Landgrave of <HI>He&s;&s;el-Ca&s;&s;el,</HI>
and in per&s;ua&s;ion a Calvi|ni&s;t,
having a chappell allowed her
within the Court; though the pu|blick
religion of the King and King|dome
be Lutheran. The Clergie
here are learned, many of them
having &s;tudied at <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>
where they learnt the Engli&s;h
Language, and among&s;t the Bi&s;hops
there is one Doctor <HI>King</HI> the &s;on of
a Scotti&s;hman. But &s;eing it is my
de&s;igne rather to ob&s;erve the con|dition
of the people, then to be
punctuall in de&s;cribing all the rari|ties
that are remarkeable in the
Countries I have been in, I &s;hall
conclude what I have to &s;ay of <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
by acquainting the Reader
that the people of that Countrey
<PB N="204" REF="107">
live far better then the <HI>Swedes,</HI>
and a&s;well as mo&s;t of their adjoyning
neighbours; and that there are &s;eve|rall
places, both there and in <HI>Nor|way.</HI>
which have the names of En|gli&s;h
towns, as <HI>Arundale, Totne&s;s,
London</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>When I fi&s;t began to write this
treati&s;e, I had &s;ome thoughts of
making ob&s;ervations upon the &s;eve|rall
governments of other States and
Dominions, where I had travelled
&s;ome years before I was in the
Countries I have been &s;peaking of,
as of the re&s;t of Germany, Hun|gary,
<HI>Switzerland, Italy</HI> and France;
but that was a &s;ubject &s;o large,
and the u&s;efulne&s;s of it to my pre&s;ent
de&s;igne &s;o incon&s;iderable, that by
doeing &s;o, I found I could neither
&s;atisfie the curious, by adding any
thing materiall to tho&s;e many who
have already obliged the publick by
the remarks of their travells in tho&s;e
places; or make my di&s;contented
Countrey men more aver&s;e then
<PB N="205" REF="107">
they are already from removing
into tho&s;e Countries, where I think
few of them will chu&s;e to tran&s;port
them&s;elves for the &s;ake of liberty and
Propertie, tho England were even
wor&s;e, than they them&s;elves fancy it
can be. All that remains to be
done then, is to conclude this trea|ti&s;e
with an obvious and popular
remark, that tho&s;e Countries where
cities are greate&s;t and mo&s;t frequen|ted
by voluntary inhabitants, are
alwayes the be&s;t to live in; and by
comparing the city of <HI>London</HI> with
all other cities of Europe, and de|mon&s;trating
by the &s;urveys I have
made (which I think will hardly be
contradicted or confuted,) that of
all the capitall cities of Europe it is
the bigge&s;t, and mo&s;t populous, &amp; &s;o
prove con&s;equentially that England,
for the generality of people, is the
be&s;t Countrey in the world e&s;pe|cially
for its natives to live in. Now
this being an ob&s;ervation, (for
what I know) not hitherto made
<PB N="206" REF="108">
good by induction and in&s;tance,
(as I intend to doe it) I hope it
will plea&s;e the Reader as much, as
if I gave him a particular account of
other Countreys and governments,
and leave it to his own reflexion to
State the compari&s;on.</P>
<P>Though <HI>London</HI> within the walls
cannot vie for bigne&s;s with many
cities of Europe; yet take the city
and &s;uburbs together, according
as it hath been &s;urveyed by <HI>Mr.
Morgan,</HI> in breadth from <HI>St.
Georges</HI> Church in Southwarke to
Shore ditch, and in length from
Limehou&s;e to petty France in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI>
and it is in a va&s;t proportion
larger in compa&s;s of ground, and
number of hou&s;es then any city
what&s;oever in Europe. This I
shall demon&s;trate fir&s;t by compare|ing
it with &s;ome cities of Hol|land,
and then with the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
cities of the other Coun|tries
of Europe, which I &s;hall &s;et
down in an alphabeticall order with
<PB N="207" REF="108">
the number of the hou&s;es they &s;eve|rally
contain.</P>
<P>When <HI>London</HI> and &s;uburbs was
&s;urveyed &s;ome years agoe by <HI>Mr.
Morgan,</HI> there were reckoned to
be in it 84000 hou&s;es be&s;ides ho&s;pi|talls,
Almeshou&s;es, and other
buildings that payed no chimney
money to the King: Now if tho&s;e
were added, and the va&s;t number
of new hou&s;es that have been built
&s;ince that &s;urvey, upon mode&s;t
computation <HI>London</HI> may be recko|ned
to countain 100000 hou&s;es;
I know the <HI>French</HI> doe vapour and
would per&s;wade the world that <HI>Pa|ris</HI>
is much bigger then <HI>London.</HI>
And the <HI>Hollanders</HI> will &s;carce be|lieve
that <HI>London</HI> hath more <HI>Hou&s;es</HI>
then the 18 <HI>Cittyes</HI> in <HI>Holland</HI> that
have voyces in the States, for &s;ay
they <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> Stands upon a 1000
<HI>Morgens</HI> land, and <HI>London</HI> Stands
but upon 1800; To both which I
an&s;wer, that it is very true that
<HI>Paris</HI> takes up a great &s;pot of ground,
<PB N="208" REF="109">
but then you mu&s;t con&s;ider, that in
<HI>Paris</HI> there are &s;everall hundreds of
<HI>Mona&s;teries, Churches, Coledges,</HI>
and <HI>Cloy&s;ters,</HI> &s;ome of them haveing
large <HI>Gardens,</HI> and that in <HI>Paris</HI>
there are 7500 <HI>Palaces</HI> and <HI>Ports</HI>
for <HI>Coaches,</HI> which have likewi&s;e
great <HI>Gardens,</HI> whereas <HI>London</HI> is
very thick built, and in the <HI>Citty</HI> the
<HI>Hou&s;es</HI> have &s;carce a Yard big
enough to &s;ett a <HI>Pump,</HI> or <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> of
conveniency in; but the weekely
bills of <HI>Mortality</HI> will decide this
<HI>Que&s;tion</HI> and plainely give it to
<HI>London,</HI> and &s;o doth <HI>Mons: la Cour,</HI>
and Sir. <HI>William Pette</HI> in his la&s;t
<HI>E&s;&s;ayes</HI> dedicated lately to our King,
makeing it appeare that <HI>London</HI> is
bigger then <HI>Paris, Rhoan,</HI> and <HI>Ro|chell</HI>
altogether; and as for <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI>
I doe appeale to all knowing
men that have &s;een it, that although
it be true that it Stands upon 1000
<HI>Morgens Land;</HI> yet there is not
above 400 <HI>Morgens</HI> built, and this I
prove thus, that the large <HI>Gardens,</HI>
<PB N="209" REF="109">
on the <HI>Heeregraft, Ky&s;ersgraft,</HI>
and <HI>Princegraft,</HI> and the <HI>Burgavalls</HI>
of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> take up more then a
third part of the <HI>Citty,</HI> then reckon
the <HI>Ba&s;tions,</HI> and the &s;pace of
<HI>Ground</HI> betweene the <HI>Wall,</HI> and
the <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> and all the <HI>Ground</HI>
unbuilt from the <HI>&V;tricks-Port,</HI> to
the <HI>We&s;oper-Port, Muyer-Port,</HI> and
&s;o to the <HI>Sea&s;ido,</HI> and you will find
it to be near 300 <HI>Morgens land:</HI>
There are 2 <HI>Parishes</HI> in the <HI>Sub|urbs</HI>
of <HI>London,</HI> viz <HI>Stepuey,</HI> and
<HI>St. Martins</HI> in the fields, (the later
being &s;o big that the la&s;t Parlement
divided it into 4 <HI>Parishes,)</HI> either
of them have more <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> then
<HI>Rotterdam,</HI> or <HI>Harlem,</HI> and there
are &s;everall other great <HI>Parishes</HI> as
<HI>St. Margrets-We&s;tmin&s;ter, St.
Giles</HI> in the fields, <HI>Toolyes,</HI> and <HI>St.
Mary Overs,</HI> the which if they &s;tood
apart in the Country would make
great <HI>Cittyes,</HI> wee reckon in <HI>London</HI>
and the <HI>Suburbs</HI> thereof to be at lea&s;t
<HI>130 Parishes,</HI> which containe
<PB N="210" REF="110">
<HI>100000 Hou&s;es,</HI> now if you reckon
<HI>8 per&s;ons</HI> to everie hou&s;e then there
are neare 800000 &s;oules in <HI>London,</HI>
but there are &s;ome that &s;ay there is a
million of &s;oules in it; I &s;hall
now &s;et downe the <HI>Cittyes Alphabe|tically</HI>
and their number of <HI>Hou&s;es</HI>
as they were given to me not only
from the <HI>Surveyours</HI> and <HI>Citty Car|penters,</HI>
but from the <HI>Bookes</HI> of the
<HI>Herthmoney,</HI> and bookes of the
<HI>Verpoundings,</HI> where &s;uch <HI>Taxes</HI>
are payd; and fir&s;t I &s;hall begin
with the 18 <HI>Cittyes</HI> that have Voyces
in the <HI>States</HI> of Holland.</P>
