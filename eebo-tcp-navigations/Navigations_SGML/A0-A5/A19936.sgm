For there is a harbour, and fayre mould for their &s;afetie. For the Pope hath no other place for Ships or Gallies but <HI>Rome,</HI> and there none will come vp but &s;mall Barkes, and Boates, and &s;uch like, by rea&s;on of the &s;hal|lowne&s;&s;e of the Riuer. In this <HI>Ciuita de Vecchia</HI> are altoge|ther


<PB REF="6">
Romanes, wholly profe&s;&s;ing the Romi&s;h Religion, &s;aying directly that the Pope is God an earth, and that he can forgiue any &s;inne what&s;oeuer being committed, which makes the mo&s;t part of them, or all, runne de&s;perately into mo&s;t deadly &s;innes.</P>
<P>For very Murther they hold it no great &s;inne, being commit|ted, receiuing of the Popes pardon, or el&s;e getting into &s;ome Mona&s;terie where they may be confe&s;&s;ed, and ab&s;olued, where|by no Law can take hold of them at their comming forth, be|ing apt and readie within a w&eacute;eke, or fortnight after to commit the like Murther, then receiuing the like pardon, or ab&s;olution, as before they had done: and thus many bloodie minded men continue their life-time, for it is an ea&s;ie matter for a man to haue his aduer&s;arie kild, or poy&s;oned for money, although his executioner neuer &s;&eacute;e him till &s;uch time as he committeth this bloudie d&eacute;ed, being hired by another.</P>
<P>Al&s;o in this Countrey their women are very lewde and wicked, for euen in that ancient Citie of Rome, there are many thou&s;ands of lewd liuing women that pay monethly vnto the Pope for the &s;innefull v&s;e of their wicked bodies: &s;ome pay &s;ixe Crownes a moneth, and &s;o from &s;ixe Crownes to one, for they are rated according to their outward &s;hew, and for the no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">-payment of this monethly pay, they &s;hall haue their goods &s;trained and carried out of their hou&s;es, or chambers, by the Popes officers, and kept from them till &s;uch time as &s;ati&s;faction is made to the Pope. So it is lawfull for any man to v&s;e any of the&s;e women as his owne wife, neither &s;hall he be mole&s;ted or troubled, or otherwi&s;e indangered, &s;o he e&s;cape &s;ecret occa&s;ions of danger, for this woman will be as dutifull vnto him as his &s;eruant, alwaies attending his plea|&s;ure for his diet or any thing el&s;e belonging vnto him: he gi|uing her content with his pur&s;e; but &s;he not receiuing content may as lawfully arre&s;t him, and ca&s;t him into pri&s;on till &s;uch time as &s;he doth receiue &s;ati&s;faction, being recouered by Law: for they hold their liuings by the Pope.</P>
<P>Now as I haue &s;poken of two deadly &s;innes wherein they exc&eacute;ed, &s;o will I &s;peake of one thing wherein &s;ome of them are to be commended, that is this. If there be any Chri&s;tian, of

In the&s;e Countries it is dangerous for an Engli&s;hman being a Prote&s;tant to &s;peake any thing again&s;t the Pope, or his Religion, e&s;pecially vnto another Engli&s;hman that is a Papi&s;t, yet this Engli&s;h Papi&s;t will &s;&eacute;eke all the meanes po&s;|&s;ible to intrappe the Prote&s;tant, and will &s;peake ill words of him&s;elfe, to draw him to the like, but when he hath made him vtter the &s;ecrets of his heart, then will he make it knowne, and more then the Prote&s;tant &s;pake, to &s;ome chiefe man of a Church, by whom he &s;hall be forced to alter his Religion, or to be burned, or put in &s;ome &s;ecret pri&s;on where he &s;hall be &s;tarued to death, and this is the manner and fa&s;hion in all Countries of Chri&s;tendome within the Popes Juri&s;diction, not onely of the treacherie of the Engli&s;h Papi&s;ts, but al&s;o of the other deadly &s;innes which I touched before, as their mur|ther and adultry: and in like manner of their generall com|pa&s;&s;ion, to a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian. What I haue h&eacute;ere writ|ten, I &s;peake not of heare-&s;ay, nor by imaignation, but directly haue &s;&eacute;ene, and of mine owne knowledge you may &s;peake it, being too long a time among&s;t them, again&s;t my will.</P>

and platformes, with great &s;tore of Ordinance planted about it, al&s;o there are many Gallies belonging to this place, which doe much offend the Chri&s;tians, in taking of their &s;hips, <HI>Tar|tanes</HI> and <HI>Satties,</HI> and other &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, making all the Chri|&s;tians that they take &s;laues, &amp; &s;elling of them in their markets like hor&s;es: for according to age and &s;trength they are pri&s;ed. This Citie is gouerned by a King, being va&s;&s;all to the great Turke. Al&s;o there are great &s;tore of Janizaries in it, to the number of 20. or 30000. at one time: the&s;e Ianizaries are chiefe Souldiers, and gouerned by a Dane, which is a generall vn|der the great Turke. The&s;e Turks are goodly people of par|&s;on, and of a very faire complexion, but very villains in minde, for they are altogether Sodomites, and doe all things contra|rie to a Chri&s;tian. For they doe neuer lye in a bed, nor f&eacute;ede vpon a Table; yet their f&eacute;eding and diet is very plentifull, their bedding and apparrell is very neat and co&s;tly, the manner of their lodging is thus: There is a very faire table in a roome, about thr&eacute;e yards in breadth, and as many in length &s;tanding in height one yard from the ground, and thereon they v&s;e to &s;pread a double quilt very co&s;tly with many curious Cu&s;hions, in &s;tead of Pillowes, whereon he lieth downe in his &s;hirt, and linnen britches onely, without any other couering, by rea&s;on of the heat of the countrey. Al&s;o in the &s;ame roome he hath ano|ther Table laid after the &s;ame fa&s;hion very richly, whereon his wiues doe lie, but &s;he that likes him be&s;t, he will take to ac|company him for the night. A Turke may haue as many wiues as he plea&s;eth, &s;o he be able to buy them, and by the number of his wiues, mo&s;t commonly his &s;ub&s;tance is knowne, for the richer he is, the more wiues he hath, the poorer the fewer: yet neuer married to none of them, but onely the fir&s;t, but maintai|ning of them all. It is very dangerous for a Chri&s;tian to be found in the company of any Turkes woman, for being found together, he &s;hall be forced to turne Turke, or el&s;e be put to death, and the &s;aid woman al&s;o &s;hall be put into a &s;acke, which being made fa&s;t, &s;he &s;hall be flung into the Sea, whether they commit the &s;inne or not. The&s;e Turkes are very zealous in their religion, acknowledging God; and <HI>Mahomet</HI> a &s;oliciter


<PB REF="7">
for their &s;innes. A Turke will k&eacute;epe his word if he &s;weares by his head, putting his hand vpon his forehead. In this coun|trey there is great &s;tore of gold and rich Marchants; the man|ner of their Churches and comming to Prayer is thus. The Church is very faire within, with many hundreds of Lampes burning therein, all matted vnder foote, without any kinde of picture, or &s;eats, al&s;o mo&s;t of them doe pray vpon Beads. In the morning on the top of the Church they hang out a white flag, and in the after noone a blew one for a &s;igne of their com|ming to Church, then goeth eight or tenne of them on the very top of the Church, and crie with a loud voice. <HI>Volla, volla hamdrulla</HI> and <HI>&s;halla,</HI> that is to &s;ay God, God, helpe vs at thy plea&s;ure, and this is their ordinary warning to come to Church, as we v&s;e Bels in Chri&s;tendome, for they abhorre the ringing of Bels, being contrary to their Prophets command.</P>
<P>A Turke choo&s;eth his fir&s;t wife after this maner. He neuer &s;&eacute;eth his wife till &s;he come to the Church to be maried, for the match is made by their friends, neither is a Turki&s;h womans face to be &s;&eacute;ene, becau&s;e their faces are continually couered going through the &s;tr&eacute;ets, both young and old: neither &s;hall a man|childe after he is tenne yeeres old euer &s;&eacute;e his mother. A Turke is Circumci&s;ed after this manner. The better Gen|tleman he is, the longer he &s;tayes afore he be Circumci&s;ed, but the time being come, then is he put vpon a very faire white hor&s;e, being very co&s;tly attired, and before him goeth two, or three hundreth by two and two in purple coates, bearing waxe candles in their hands, and after them followeth a great ma|ny playing on diffu&s;ed In&s;truments making of a great noi&s;e, then followeth a Bull couered with very faire Arras, and his hornes gilded, and next rideth he that &s;hall be Circumci&s;ed, with all his friends following, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumci&s;ion, where they cut off the fore&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ne of his yard, naming of him <HI>Morat, Shebane,</HI> or <HI>Ho&s;an,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch like name: then will they take the Bull, and turne his head to to the Ea&s;t-ward, then cut his throat, &s;aying, this day wee haue done a good d&eacute;ed, then they cut the Bull in yeeces, and di|&s;tribute it among his friends, and kindred, and &s;o they re|turne

home where they doe fea&s;t with great ioy.</P>
<P>The manner of a Chri&s;tian turning Turke, is thus. He is put vpon a hor&s;e with his face towards the tayle, and a Bow and an Arrow in his hand, then the picture of Chri&s;t is car|ried before him with his feete vpwards, at the which he drawes his Bow with the Arrow therein, and thus he rideth to the place of Circumci&s;ion, cur&s;ing his father that begate him, and and his mother that bore him, his Country, and all his kindred: then comming to the place of Circumci&s;ion, he is Circumci&s;ed, receiuing a name, &amp; denying his Chri&s;tian name, &s;o that euer after he is called a <HI>Runagado,</HI> that is, a Chri&s;tian denying Chri&s;t and turned Turke: of which &s;ort there are more in Turkie and Barbary then of naturall Turkes. The manner of their iudgement for offending of the Law touching death, eyther for theft or murther, is thus: within foure houres after he is taken, he is condemned by certaine chiefe Souldiers, and pre&s;ently put to death after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> gan&s;hed, &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">aked or beat to death. Their gan&s;hing is after this manner: He &s;itteth vpon a wall, being fiue fadomes high, within two fadomes of the top of the wall, right vnder the place where he &s;its, is a &s;trong Iron hooke fa&s;tned, being very &s;harpe, then is he thru&s;t off the wall vpon this hooke with &s;ome part of his bodie, and there he hangeth &s;ometimes two or thr&eacute;e daies before he dieth. Staking to death is thus: Around p&eacute;ece of wood thr&eacute;e yards long, and as big as a mans leg, being &s;harpe at one end, is ta|ken and driuen in at the fundament of the offender, and out at his &s;houlder, and &s;o they let him lie till he be dead, which &s;ome|times will not be in a day or two. The manner of beating to death is thus: They take the offender, and lay him down vpon his backe, being naked, and with two double ropes, two &s;euerall men, one on the one &s;ide, and the other on the other &s;ide of him, beate on his belly till he is dead. But the&s;e deaths are very &s;eldome v&s;ed, becau&s;e they are &s;o fearefull to the offen|ders, yet I haue &s;&eacute;ene them all executed.</P>

Then was I brought before the high In|qui&s;itioner, who demanded of me, whether he that I buried had receiued the Sacrament &amp; confe&s;t, according to the Romane or|der or no, I an&s;wered no; he was a good Chri&s;tian, but receiued not the Sacrament, nor was not confe&s;t, after the order of <HI>Rome:</HI> then he &s;aid that he was, by a Frier of the <HI>Me&s;ericordia,</HI> &amp; there|fore thou &s;halt be burned. Then I intreated that I might but &s;peake, and he &s;aid &s;peake on: then I a&s;ked them this, whether the Frier that confe&s;t him could &s;peak any Engli&s;h or no, he an|&s;wered that he could &s;peake none: then tell me quoth I, how an Italian Frier (can confe&s;&s;e an Engli&s;hman &s;peaking no En|gli&s;h, nor the Engli&s;hman &s;peaking no Italian, nor other lan|guage but his mother tongue? for you know wel there mu&s;t be no interpreter in confe&s;&s;ion, &amp; if the Sacrament were mini&s;tred vnto him, the hou&s;e where he died can iu&s;tifie it. Then the Inqui|&s;itioner hearing this, &s;cratched his head, &s;aying, this fellow hath &s;poken the truth, wherfore take him and put him out into a large pri&s;on, whether I was brought, where I liued ten w&eacute;eks being well, and often relieued by Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants, who reioyced much to &s;ee me aliue.

<P>THus farre (gentle Reader) I thought good, out of my &s;lender capacitie, to acquaint th&eacute;e with a briefe and plaine di&s;cour&s;e of my Trauell, which though it be rude, as comming from a barren brayne, which profe&s;&s;eth nothing le&s;&s;e then lear|ning: yet a&s;&s;ure thy &s;elfe it containes vndoubted truth, being no more then I haue &s;&eacute;ene, knowne, and to my griefe and pe|rill felt. And if any, as well or better acquainted with the&s;e Parts, or any of them, whereof I make mention, di&s;liking the rudene&s;&s;e of my &s;tile, will vndertake to refine it, h&eacute;e giues me no di&s;content, &s;o he derogate not from the truth thereof. And whereas I made promi&s;e in the beginning of this Trea|ti&s;e, in the&s;e twelue di&s;cour&s;es, to touch or &s;peake &s;omething of the re&s;t of the places, &s;pecified in the Table, I haue partly performed it: but to haue written of them at large, would haue b&eacute;ene but friuolous and &s;uperfluous, partly becau&s;e they are places of no extraordinary note, but &s;pecially becau&s;e they doe in mo&s;t, or all things, agr&eacute;e with the Countries to which they are annexed, and tributaries, or va&s;&s;alls: as the Ilands tributary to the Spaniards, follow their manner of gouern|ment, cu&s;tomes, and orders.

What Engli&s;h heart (I &s;ay) duly pondering the&s;e things in generall, or any one of the&s;e things in particular, can otherwi&s;e choo&s;e but falling downe on his bended kn&eacute;es, y&eacute;eld God immortall and innumerable thanks and pray&s;e-giuing, not onely for electing him aboue all other Nations of the Earth, to the true and perfect knowledge of his ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pell, but al&s;o for pre&s;eruing him &s;o long from &s;o many mi&s;eries and wretched thral|domes, whereunto mo&s;t Nations of the Earth are &s;ubiect?</P>
