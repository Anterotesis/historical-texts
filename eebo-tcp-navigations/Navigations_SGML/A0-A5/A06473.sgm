The Head of this Church hath beene twice troubled with aburning Fe|uer, and so the City to keep it from a third danger, let it stand without an head. I can but admire the Charity of former times, to Build such famous temples, when as these Ages cannot finde Repaire to them, but then the World was all Church, and now the Church is all World: then Charity went before, and exceeded Prea|ching; now there is much Preaching, nay more the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> euer, yet lesse Charity; o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">

There is more Reason to suspect the pre|cise Puritaine deuoyd of Charity, then the simple Ignorant fraught withgood Workes. I thinke truly in this one point, the ends of their Actions were for good, and what they aimed at was Gods glory, &amp; their owne happines.
