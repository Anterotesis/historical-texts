<P>Here are inter&s;per&s;ed &s;ome Ob&s;er|vations,
which though already known

for the information of whom
<PB REF="6">
this Book is <HI>&s;econdarily</HI> intended; and

the Thir&s;t which Forreigners general|ly
have to know the <HI>Pre&s;ent State of</HI>
this <HI>Con&s;iderable Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>Although the main aim is to inform
all men of the <HI>Pre&s;ent State</HI> of this
Kingdom, yet divers <HI>Reflections</HI> are
made upon the <HI>pa&s;t State</HI> thereof,
that &s;o by comparing that with the
pre&s;ent, &s;ome men may thereby not

better, and the <HI>abolition</HI> of what is

A good Hi&s;torian by running back to

viewing the pre&s;ent times, and com|paring
the one with the other, may then
run forward, and give a Verdict of the
State almo&s;t Prophetick.</HI></P>
<P>In the many Reflections upon the
Antient State of <HI>England,</HI> frequent
u&s;e is made of divers grave Authors,
as of <HI>Horn</HI> in his <HI>Mirror of Ju&s;tice,</HI>
of <HI>Glanvile, Bracton, Britton, For|te&s;cue,
Linwood, Stamford, Smith,
Co&s;ens, Camden, Cook, Spelman,
Selden, &amp;c.</HI> And for the <HI>pre&s;ent
State,</HI> Con&s;ultation was had with
&s;everal eminently learned Per&s;ona|ges
yet living, to the end that the
Reader might receive at lea&s;t &s;ome
&s;atisfaction in every particular, with|out
the trouble and charges of a
great <HI>Library.</HI> And as the Author
doth &s;ometimes u&s;e both the <HI>Words</HI>
of the <HI>Living</HI> and the <HI>Writings&punc;</HI> of the
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Dead,</HI> without quoting any, to a|void
O&s;tentation; &s;o he hopes that
this ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion being
made at fir&s;t, no man will be offend|ed
though he give no notice when the
Ob&s;ervation is theirs, and when it is
his own; having taken &s;pecial care
that both in theirs and in his own,
there &s;hould be nothing but the
<HI>truth:</HI> &s;o that although the Reader
not perceiving every where by what
Authority divers things are averred,
may be apt to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome things
are <HI>gratis dicta,</HI> yet if it &s;hall plea&s;e him
to make &s;earch, he will find that ge|nerally
they are <HI>vere &amp; cum authorita|te

<P>However in a Subject &s;o <HI>multiform</HI>
as this, where &s;o many Marks are
aimed at, no wonder if in &s;ome the
Author hath not hit the <HI>White;</HI> but
where&s;oever it was mi&s;&s;ed, it is not
perhaps much wide there-from; and
<PB REF="7">
if in any thing by <HI>mi&s;-information</HI> or
