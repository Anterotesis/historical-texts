<HEAD>LAMENTABLE newes shewing the won|derfull deliuerance of M. Edmond Pet Sailer and Mai&s;ter of a &s;hip, dwelling in Seething Lane in London, neare Barking Church. With <HI>other &s;trange things, lately happened, concer|ning the great winds and tempestuous weather both at Sea and</HI> Land.</HEAD>
<P>_GOod Reader, I haue here &s;et downe vnto thy view, and for thy example to amendment, the great hurt and lo&s;&s;es that hath b&eacute;ene both at Sea and Land, but e&s;pecially the wonderfull pre&s;eruation of one Mai&s;ter <HI>Edmond Pet</HI> Sayler, and Mai&s;ter of a &s;hip, and part owner, who was comming from New Ca&s;tle with his Ship lading, and with diuers o|thers in the &s;hip, both pa&s;&s;engers, and his owne &s;eruants: griefe to tell, as it is well knowne, and too well, if it had bene Gods will to the contrarie, the wind being ruffe and furious, cau&s;ed the Seas to be outragious and boy&s;te|rous, and the waues thereof to be &s;o great, and to ari&s;e &s;o hie, that many times they were readie to ouerwhelme the &s;hip, yet by Gods prouidence &amp; the great care of this Mai&s;ter <HI>Pet</HI> being Mai&s;ter, and &s;ore labour and earne&s;t
<PB REF="3"> praier vnto the Lord, night and day of tho&s;e in the &s;hip, they were pre&s;erued vntill they came within the kenning of Land, both of <HI>Yearmouth</HI> and <HI>Harwich,</HI> and other townes, but &s;till the wind did growe more &s;trong, and the waues greater, and euery one ouertyred with &s;ore la|bour, as &s;ome at the pumpe, and &s;ome otherwaies, not one hauing lea&s;ure or &s;tomacke almo&s;t either to eat or drinke, &s;o that then they did wholy relie vpon Gods mercy, cea|&s;ing from their labours, and then did this Mai&s;ter <HI>Pet</HI> make a godly &s;p&eacute;ech: &s;aying vnto the re&s;t, <Q> Let vs all kn&eacute;ele downe with earne&s;t praier, and euen with the kn&eacute;es of our hearts, de&s;ire God for his deare &s;onne Ie&s;us Chri&s;t his &s;ake, to deliuer vs from this great danger, crying all with loud and wofull voyces, O Lord pre&s;erue vs now, that we may liue and honour th&eacute;e in pray&s;ing thy name with P&s;almes of thanke&s;giuing, as thou did&s;t pre&s;erue <HI>Ionas</HI> thr&eacute;e daies in the maine Seas, and in the belly of a mightie deuouring Whale, and cha&s;t <HI>Su&s;anna</HI> from the wicked Elders, who would haue di&s;honoured God in their lu&s;t, and brought to de&s;truction that godly woman and cha&s;t wife. Likewi&s;e O Lord, thou did&s;t pre&s;erue thy &s;eruant <HI>Daniel</HI> from the gr&eacute;edie iawes of the cruell and rauenous Lyons, being of purpo&s;e kept hungry in their dennes. O good Lord thou did&s;t make the blind to &s;&eacute;e, the halt and lame to goe, and the dead to ari&s;e and walke, &s;o good Lord if it be thy ble&s;&s;ed will, thou can&s;t now deli|uer vs, euen now when all mans helpe is pa&s;t. </Q> And now in this &s;pace while Mai&s;ter <HI>Pet</HI> was v&s;ing the&s;e &s;p&eacute;eches, and earne&s;t prayer to God, the &s;hip began to &s;inke d&eacute;eper and d&eacute;eper into the Sea, whereupon euery one began to &s;hift for him&s;elfe in laying hold &s;ome vpon one thing, and &s;ome vpon another. As they were &s;tanding vpon the hat|ches &s;till called on God, but &s;&eacute;eing there was no way to &s;aue them&s;elues, then with great &s;hrikes and loud cries they were al drowned: Nay more, not one liuing thing in the &s;hip &s;aued. And Mai&s;ter <HI>Edmond Pet,</HI> after he had
<PB REF="3"> bene vnder water, by Gods helpe tooke hold of the maine Ma&s;t and got out his knife and cut certaine cords or lines and made &s;hift to get vp to the top of the Ma&s;t, and there tied him&s;elfe, for feare lea&s;t by the &s;trength of the winde &amp; rain, he &s;hould be blowne off into the Sea. All which this man in mi&s;erie did &s;&eacute;e, and him&s;elfe looking euery minute of an houre to ta&s;te of the &s;ame cup the re&s;t had done: for now halfe the maine Ma&s;t whereon he &s;ate was couered with water, this being about &s;euen of the clocke in the morning. Thus &s;at this grieued man all that day and all night, &s;&eacute;eing nothing but water readie to &s;wallow him vp: yet vpon the next day, betw&eacute;ene the houres of &s;euen and eight of the clocke, to his great comfort, he de&s;cried a &s;hip comming towards him, he being beaten &s;o &s;ore with winde and weather, that he could hardly &s;peake, for his body was &s;welled as bigge as two bodies, and likewi&s;e his legges did grow to &s;uch a bignes, that they were more like to the wa&s;te or middle of a man, then the legge of a man, yet when this &s;hip came neare vnto him, he cryed and called as well as he could, that they would &s;aue him, and take him into their &s;hip. One or two of them an&s;we|red very briefly, we are &s;orrie, we are &s;orrie, but we cannot &s;tay. O mo&s;t vnkind men, and in humane, that euer man &s;hould haue cau&s;e to &s;ay, that euer any Chri&s;tian &s;hould be &s;o hard-harted to leaue a man in that di&s;tre&s;&s;e. But when he &s;aw them &s;aile away, Oh! it was more then halfe a killing to his poore heart. Well when he had &s;at on this maine Ma&s;t vntill the next morning, which was 48. houres, there came towards him by Gods appoyntment a man of warre, being a <HI>Hollander,</HI> who did &s;hew him kindnes and mercy, for he did &s;end his &s;hip-boate for him, and brought him to his &s;hip, and did &s;eeke to comfort him in what he could, like the good <HI>Samaritane,</HI> but this Mai|&s;ter <HI>Pet</HI> was &s;o weather beaten, and &s;o &s;welled, that he could neither eate nor drinke: yet this man of warre would and did what he could for him, for &s;&eacute;eing he could
<PB REF="4"> not comfort him with any thing he had in his &s;hip, he &s;ay|led into a towne in <HI>Suffolke,</HI> called <HI>Harwich,</HI> and there &s;t him on &s;hore, not leauing him vntill he had brought him to &s;ome of his old acquaintance, who did not knowe him: nay more, his owne wife did not knowe him, when he was brought home to <HI>London,</HI> by rea&s;on he was &s;welled of &s;uch bignes, and &s;o changed with &s;itting, as I tolde you before 48. houres in the winde &amp; raine. And &s;ee and heare and giue God prai&s;e; yet more of Gods wonderfull kind|nes in deliuering this Mai&s;ter <HI>Pet</HI> once before, who com|ming from a farre voyage in a Ship of Marchandi&s;e, by mi&s;fortune the Ship was &s;plit, the Ship and all the goods lo&s;t, and to the number of eight&eacute;ene per&s;ons drowned. And this man left aliue to tell vnto the world what God had done for him, that all that heare it might prai&s;e the Lord: and prai&s;ed be the name of the Lord, he is now well and in perfect health. And as I &s;aid before, dwelling in S&eacute;ething Lane in <HI>London.</HI> Wel now leauing this &s;ad &s;torie of Mai&s;ter <HI>Pet,</HI> with griefe I mu&s;t tell you, of others harmes and lo&s;&s;es: Fir&s;t there was to the great terror and griefe of many the beholders, &s;ixe &s;core dead men taken vp, vpon <HI>Yarmouth</HI> &s;hore, the lo&s;&s;es of Boates and Lyters, and men lately vpon the Thames, is too well knowne, if it had b&eacute;ene Gods will to haue bene other|waies, for many haue &s;&eacute;ene dead men &s;wimming too and fro betw&eacute;ene <HI>Graues End</HI> and <HI>London,</HI> being carried by the Tyde, and &s;till hats or cloakes, and &s;taues, and diuers other things of Pa&s;&s;e~gers haue &s;eene bene vpo~ y^e Thames &s;wimming too and fro, &amp; a great Barge being laden with fagots and billets, and other timber to make cartwh&eacute;eles, was ca&s;t away n&eacute;ere <HI>London</HI> bridge, being in a &s;torme of winde, and all her lading &s;wimming vp and downe the Thames. Likewi&s;e neare the coa&s;t of <HI>Douer</HI> &amp; <HI>Sandwich,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Wayborne Hoope</HI> in <HI>Norfolke,</HI> was much hurt done, with the lo&s;&s;e of many mens liues. Likewi&s;e all the vpper parts of a windmill in <HI>Bedford&s;hire</HI> was blowne
<PB REF="4"> away, but God be prai&s;ed none kild. Neare <HI>Sharnbrook,</HI> a traueller of <HI>London</HI> that came downe to &s;&eacute;e his friends, was by the &s;trength of the winde blowne off from a bridge, but by others was taken vp aliue and &s;aued. Two men and their hor&s;es in <HI>Glo&s;ter&s;hire</HI> were blowne from a bridge, &amp; both hor&s;e and men drowned. A man neere <HI>Bed|ford</HI> being thatching a hou&s;e, was blowne off &amp; kild: tr&eacute;es blowne vp by the rootes, other re&s;t and torne, hou&s;es and chimnies quite blowne downe, falling vpon cattell &amp; kild them, to the great lo&s;&s;e and hurt of many men. And diuers other &s;trange matters I could &s;peake of, all which is for our &s;innes. God grant we way take warning to amend our liues by the&s;e dangers &amp; lo&s;&s;es, or el&s;e we mu&s;t n&eacute;eds looke for farther puni&s;hment. For as God is mercifull, &s;o he is Iu&s;t, and will puni&s;h vs if we will not be warned by the&s;e examples. God grant for his Sonne Ie&s;us Chri&s;ts &s;ake we may all be warned to amend our liues. Amen.</P>
