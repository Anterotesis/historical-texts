<P>_LEast I should wrong any in dedica|ting this Booke to one: I haue con|cluded it shal be particular to none. I found it only dedicated to a Hand, and to that hand I addresse it. Now for that this businesse is common to the world, this booke may best satis|fie the world, because it was penned in the Land it treateth of. If it bee disliked of men, then I would recommend it to women, for being dearely bought, and farre sought, it should be good for Ladies. When all men reiected <HI>Christopher Collumbus:</HI> that ever renowned Queene Izabell of Spaine, could pawne her Iewels to supply his wants; whom all the wise men (as they thought them|selues) of that age contemned. I need not say what was his worthinesse, her noblenesse, and their ignorance, that so scornefully did spit at his wants, seeing the whole world is enriched with his golden fortunes. Cannot this successfull example moue the incredulous of this time, to consider, to conceaue, &amp; apprehend <HI>Virginia,</HI> which might be, or breed vs a second India? hath not England an Izabell, as well as Spaine, nor yet a <HI>Collumbus</HI> as well as <HI>Genua?</HI> yes surely it hath, whose desires are no lesse then was worthy <HI>Collum bus,</HI> their certainties more, their experiences no way wan|ting, only there wants but an Izabell, so it were not from Spaine.</P>

<HEAD>THE DESCRIPTION OF <HI>VIRGINIA BY CAP|TAINE</HI> SMITH.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_VIRGINIA</HI> is a Country in <HI>Ameri|ca</HI> that lyeth betweene the degrees of 34 and 44 of the north latitude. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The latitude.</NOTE> The bounds thereof on the East side are the great <HI>Ocean.</HI> On the South lyeth <HI>Florida:</HI> on the North <HI>nova Francia.</HI> As for the West thereof, the limits are vnknowne. Of all this country wee purpose not to speake, but only of that part which was planted by the English men in the yeare of our Lord, 1606. <HI>And this is vnder the degrees 37. 38. and</HI> 39. The temperature of this countrie doth agree well with English constitutions being once seasoned to the country. Which appeared by this, that though by many occasions our people fell sicke; yet did they recover by very small meanes &amp; continued in health, though there were other great causes, not only to haue made them sicke, but even to end their daies, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The sommer is hot as in <HI>Spaine;</HI> the winter colde as in <NOTE PLACE="marg">The te~perature.</NOTE> <HI>Fraunce</HI> or <HI>England.</HI> The heat of sommer is in Iune, Iulie, and August, but commonly the coole Breefes asswage the vehemencie of the heat. The chiefe of winter is halfe De|cember, Ianuary; February, and halfe March. The colde is extreame sharpe, but here the proverbe is true that <HI>no ex|treame long continueth.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeare 1607. was an extraordinary frost in most of <HI>Europe,</HI> and this frost was founde as extreame in <HI>Uirginia.</HI> But the next yeare for 8. or 10. daies of ill weather, other 14 daies would be as Sommer.</P>
<P>The windes here are variable, but the like thunder and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The windes.</NOTE> lightning to purifie the aire, I haue seldome either seene or
<PB N="2" REF="7">
heard in <HI>Europe.</HI> From the Southwest came the greatest gustes with thunder and heat. The Northwest winde is co~|monly coole and bringeth faire weather with it. From the North is the greatest cold, and from the East and South-East as from the <HI>Barmadas,</HI> fogs and raines.</P>
<P>Some times there are great droughts other times much raine, yet great necessity of neither, by reason we see not but that all the variety of needfull fruits in <HI>Europe</HI> may be there in great plenty by the industry of men, as appeareth by those we there planted.</P>
<P>There is but one entraunce by sea into this country and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The entrances.</NOTE> that is at the mouth of a very goodly Bay the widenesse whereof is neare 18. or 20. miles. The cape on the South|side is called <HI>Ccpe Henry</HI> in honour of our most noble <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Henry.</NOTE> Prince. The shew of the land there is a white hilly sand like vnto the Downes, and along the shores great plentie of Pines and Firres.</P>
<P>The north <HI>Cape</HI> is called <HI>Cape Charles</HI> in honour of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Charles.</NOTE> worthy Duke of <HI>Yorke.</HI> Within is a country that may haue the prerogatiue over the most pleasant places of <HI>Europe, A+sia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> for large and pleasant navigable rivers, heaven &amp; earth never agreed better to frame a place for mans habitation being of our constitutions, were it ful|ly manured and inhabited by industrious people. here are mountaines, hils, plaines, valleyes, rivers and brookes, all <NOTE PLACE="marg">The country.</NOTE> running most pleasantly into a faire Bay co~passed but for the mouth with fruitfull and delightsome land. In the Bay and rivers are many Isles both great and small, some woo|dy, some plaine, most of them low and not inhabited. This Bay lieth North and South in which the water floweth neare 200 miles &amp; hath a channell for 140 miles, of depth betwixt 7 and 15 fadome, holding in breadth for the most part 10 or 14 miles. Fro~ the head of the Bay at the north, the land is mountanous, &amp; so in a manner from thence by a Southwest line; So that the more Southward, the farther of from the Bay are those mounetaines. From which fall
<PB N="3" REF="7">
certaine brookes which after come to fiue principall navi|gable rivers. These run from the Northwest into the South east, and so into the west side of the Bay, where the fall of every River is within 20 or 15 miles one of another.</P>
<P>The mountaines are of diverse natures for at the head of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The mou~taines.</NOTE> the Bay the rockes are of a composition like milnstones. Some of marble, &amp;c. And many peeces of christall we fou~d as throwne downe by water from the mountaines. For in winter these mountaines are covered with much snow, &amp; when it dissolveth the waters fall with such violence, that it causeth great inundations in the narrow valleyes which yet is scarce perceived being once in the rivers. These wa|ters wash from the rocks such glistering tinctures that the ground in some places seemeth as guilded, where both the rocks and the earth are so splendent to behold, <HI>that better iudgements then ours might haue beene perswaded, they con|tained more then probabilities.</HI> The vesture of the earth in most places doeth manifestly proue the nature of the soile to be lusty and very rich. The colour of the earth we found <NOTE PLACE="marg">The soile.</NOTE> in diverse places, resembleth <HI>bole Armoniac, terra sigillata ad lemnia,</HI> Fullers earth marle and divers other such appea|rances. But generally for the most part the earth is a black sandy mould, in some places a fat slimy clay, in other pla|ces a very barren gravelli. But the best ground is knowne by the vesture it beareth, as by the greatnesse of trees or a|bundance of weedes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The country is not mountanous nor yet low but such <NOTE PLACE="marg">The vallyes.</NOTE> pleasant plaine hils &amp; fertle valleyes, one prettily crossing an other, and watered so conveniently with their sweete brookes and christall springs, as if art it selfe had devised them. By the rivers are many plaine marishes containing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plaines.</NOTE> some 20 some 100 some 200 Acres, some more, some lesse. Other plaines there are fewe, but only where the <HI>Savages</HI> inhabit: but all overgrowne with trees and weedes being a plaine wildernes as God first made it.</P>
<P>On the west side of the Bay, wee said were 5. faire and
<PB N="4" REF="8">
delightfull <HI>navigable</HI> rivers, of which wee will nowe pro|ceed to report. The first of those rivers and the next to the mouth of the Bay hath his course from the West and by North. The name of this river they call <HI>Powhatan</HI> accor|to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The river Pow|hatan.</NOTE> the name of a principall country that lieth vpon it. The mouth of this river is neere three miles in breadth, <HI>yet doe the shoules force the Channell so neere the land that a Sacre will overshoot it at point blanck. This river is navigable 100 miles, the shouldes and soundings are here needlesse to bee ex|pressed.</HI> It falleth from Rockes farre west in a country inha|bited by a nation that they call <HI>Monacan.</HI> But where it commeth into our discoverie it is <HI>Powhatan.</HI> In the far|thest place that was diligently observed, are falles, rockes, showles, &amp;c. which makes it past navigation <HI>any higher.</HI> Thence in the running downeward, the river is enriched with many goodly brookes, which are maintained by an infinit number of smal rundles and pleasant springs that di+sperse themselues for best service, as doe the vaines of a mans body. From the South there fals into this river. First <NOTE PLACE="marg">The branches.</NOTE> the pleasant river of <HI>Apamatuck.</HI> next more to the East are the two rivers of <HI>Quiyoughcohanocke.</HI> A little farther is a Bay wherein falleth 3 or 4 prettie brookes &amp; creekes that halfe intrench the Inhabitants of <HI>Warraskoyac</HI> then the ri|ver of <HI>Nandsamund,</HI> and lastly the brooke of <HI>Chisapeack.</HI> From the North side is the river of <HI>Chickahamania,</HI> the backe river of <HI>Iames</HI> Towne; another by the <HI>Cedar Isle,</HI> where we lived 10 weekes vpon oisters, then a convenient harbour for fisher boats or smal boats at <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI> that so conveniently turneth it selfe into <HI>Bayes</HI> and Creeks that make that place very pleasant to inhabit, their cornefields being girded therein in a manner as <HI>Peninsulaes.</HI> The most of these rivers are inhabited by severall nations, or rather families. Of the name of the rivers. They haue also in every of those places some Gouernour, as their king, which they call <HI>Werowances.</HI> In a <HI>Peninsula</HI> on the North side of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames Towne.</NOTE> river are the English planted in a place by the~ called <HI>Iames</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
Towne, in honour of the Kings most excellent Maiestie, vpon which side are also many places vnder the <HI>Werow|ances.</HI></P>
<P>The first and next the rivers mouth are the <HI>Kecoughtans,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The severall in|habitants.</NOTE> who besides their women and children, haue not past 20. fighting men. The <HI>Paspaheghes</HI> on whose land is seated the English Colony, some 40. miles from the <HI>Bay</HI> haue not past 40. The river called <HI>Chickahamania</HI> neere 200. The <HI>Weanocks</HI> 100. The <HI>Arrowhatocks</HI> 30. The place called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> some 40. On the South side this river the <HI>Ap|pamatucks</HI> haue 60 fighting men. The <HI>Quiyougcohanocks,</HI> 25. The <HI>Warraskoyacks</HI> 40. The <HI>Nandsamunds</HI> 200. The <HI>Chesapeacks</HI> are able to make 100. Of this last place the <HI>Bay</HI> beareth the name. In all these places is a severall com|mander, which they call <HI>Werowance,</HI> except the <HI>Chickha|manians,</HI> who are governed by the Priestes and their Assi|stants of their Elders called <HI>Caw-cawwassoughes.</HI> In somer no place affordeth more plentie of <HI>Sturgeon,</HI> nor in winter more abundance of fowle, especially in the time of frost. There was once taken 52 Sturgeons at a draught, at ano|ther draught 68. From the later end of May till the end of Iune are taken few, but yong Sturgeons of 2 foot or a yard long. From thence till the midst of September, them of 2 or three yards long and fewe others. And in 4 or 5 houres with one nette were ordinarily taken 7 or 8: often more, seldome lesse. In the small rivers all the yeare there is good plentie of small fish, so that with hookes those that would take paines had sufficient.</P>
<P>Foureteene miles Northward from the river <HI>Powhatan,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">R. Pamavnke.</NOTE> is the river <HI>Pamavnke, which is navigable 60 or 70 myles, but with Catches and small Barkes, 30 or 40 myles farther.</HI> At the ordinary flowing of the salt water, it divideth it selfe into two gallant branches. On the South side inha|bit the people of <HI>Youghtanund,</HI> who haue about 60 me~ for <NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabitants.</NOTE> warres. On the North branch <HI>Mattapament,</HI> who haue 30 men. Where this river is divided the Country is called <HI>Pa|mavuke,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="9">
and nourisheth neere 300 able men. About 25 miles lower on the North side of this river is <HI>Werawocomo|co,</HI> where their great King inhabited when Captain <HI>Smith</HI> was deliuered him prisoner; yet there are not past 40 able men. But now he hath abandoned that, and liueth at <HI>Ora|pakes</HI> by <HI>Youghtanund</HI> in the wildernesse; 10 or 12 myles lower; on the South side of this river is <HI>Chiskiack,</HI> which hath some 40 or 50 men. These, as also <HI>Apamatuck, Irro|hatock,</HI> and <HI>Powhatan,</HI> are their great kings chiefe alliance and inhabitance. The rest (as they report) his Conquests.</P>
<P>Before we come to the third river that falleth from the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Payankatank. R</NOTE> mountaines, there is another river <HI>(some 30 myles navi|gable)</HI> that commeth from the Inland, the river is called <HI>Payankatanke,</HI> the Inhabitants are about some 40 service|able men.</P>
<P>The third navigable riuer is called <HI>Toppahanock. (This</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Toppahanock. R</NOTE> <HI>is navigable some 130 myles)</HI> At the top of it inhabit the people called <HI>Mannahoackes</HI> amongst the mountaines, but they are aboue the place we describe. Vpon this river on the North side are seated a people called <HI>Cuttatawomen,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabitants</NOTE> with 30 fighting men. Higher on the riuer are the <HI>Mo|raughtacunds,</HI> with 80 able men. Beyond them <HI>Toppaha|nock</HI> with 100 men. Far aboue is another <HI>Cuttatawomen</HI> with 20 men. On the South, far within the river is <HI>Nau|taughtacund</HI> hauing 150 men. This river also as the two former, is replenished with fish and foule.</P>
<P>The fourth river is called <HI>Patawomeke</HI> &amp; is 6 or 7 miles in breadth. <HI>It is navigable 140 miles, &amp;</HI> fed as the rest with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Patawomek, R.</NOTE> many sweet rivers and springs, which fall from the borde|ring hils. These hils many of them are planted, and yeelde no lesse plenty and variety of fruit then the river exceedeth with abundance of fish. This river is inhabited on both sides. First on the South side at the very entrance is <HI>Wigh|cocomoco</HI> &amp; hath some 130 men, beyond them <HI>Sekacawone</HI> with 30. The <HI>Onawmanient</HI> with 100. Then <HI>Patawomeke</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The inhabitants</NOTE> with 160 able men. Here doth the river divide it selfe in
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to 3 or 4 convenient rivers; The greatest of the least is cal|led <HI>Quiyough</HI> treadeth north west, but the river it selfe tur|neth <HI>North east</HI> and is stil a navigable streame. On the we|sterne side of this bought is <HI>Tauxenent</HI> with 40 men. On the north of this river is <HI>Secowocomoco</HI> with 40 men. Some what further <HI>Potapaco</HI> with 20. In the East part of the bought of the river, is <HI>Pamacacack</HI> with 60 me~, After <HI>Moy owances</HI> with 100. And lastly <HI>Nacotchtanke</HI> with 80 able men. The river 10 miles aboue this place maketh his pas|sage downe a low pleasant vally overshaddowed in manie places with high rocky mountaines; from whence distill innumerable sweet and pleasant springs,</P>
<P>The fifth river is called <HI>Pawtuxunt,</HI> and is of a lesse pro|portion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pawtuxunt, R.</NOTE> then the rest; but the channell is 16 or 18 fadome deepe in some places. Here are infinit skuls of divers kinds of fish more then elsewhere. Vpon this river dwell the peo|ple called <HI>Acquintanacksuak, Pawtuxunt</HI> and <HI>Mattapa|nient.</HI> 200 men was the greatest strength that could bee there perceived. But they inhabit togither, and not so dis|persed as the rest. These of al other were found the most ci|vill to giue intertainement.</P>
<P>Thirty leagues Northward is a river not inhabited, yet na+vigable; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolus, R.</NOTE> for the red earth or clay resembling <HI>bole Armoni|ack</HI> the English called it <HI>Bolus.</HI> At the end of the Bay where <NOTE PLACE="marg">The head of the Bay.</NOTE> it is 6 or 7 miles in breadth, there fall into it 4 small rivers, 3 of them issuing from diverse bogges invironed with high mountaines. There is one that commeth <HI>du</HI> north 3 or 4. daies iourny fro~ the head of the Bay and fals from rocks &amp; mountaines, vpon this riuer inhabit a people called <HI>Sas|quesahanock.</HI> They are seated 2 daies higher then was pas|sage <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sasquesahanock.</NOTE> for the discoverers Barge, which was hardly 2 toons, and had in it but 12 men to perform this discouery, where|in they lay aboue the space of 12 weekes vpon those great waters in those vnknowne Countries, hauing nothing but a little meale or oatmeale and water to feed them; &amp; scarse halfe sufficient of that for halfe that time, but that by the
<PB N="8" REF="10">

<HEAD>Of such things which are naturall in Uirginia and how they vse them.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Uirginia</HI> doth afford many excellent vegitables and li|uing Creatures, yet grasse there is little or none, but what groweth in lowe Marishes: for all the Countrey is over|growne <NOTE PLACE="marg">Why there is lit|tle grasse.</NOTE> with trees, whose droppings continually turneth their grasse to weedes, by reason of the ranck nesse of the ground which would soone be amended by good husban|dry. The wood that is most common is Oke and Walnut, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weeds with their fruits.</NOTE> many of their Okes are so tall and straight, that they will beare two foote and a halfe square of good timber for 20 yards long; Of this wood there is 2 or 3 seuerall kinds. The Acornes of one kind, whose barke is more white, then the other, is somewhat sweetish, which being boyled halfe a day in severall waters, at last afford a sweete oyle, which they keep in goards to annoint their heads and ioints. The fruit they eate made in bread or otherwise. There is also some Elme, some black walnut tree, and some Ash: of Ash <NOTE PLACE="marg">Elme.</NOTE> and Elme they make sope Ashes. If the trees be very great, the ashes will be good, and melt to hard lumps, but if they be small, it will be but powder, and not so good as the o|ther. Of walnuts there is 2 or 3 kindes; there is a kinde of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Walnuts. Supposed Cypres</NOTE> wood we called Cypres, because both the wood, the fruit, and leafe did most resemble it, and of those trees there are

some neere 3 fadome about at the root very straight, and 50, 60, or 80 foot without a braunch. By the dwelling of the <HI>Savages</HI> are some great Mulbery trees, and in some parts of the Countrey, they are found growing naturally <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mulberies.</NOTE> in prettie groues. There was an assay made to make silke, &amp; and surely the wormes prospered excellent well, till the master workeman fell sicke. During which time they were eaten with rats.</P>
<P>In some parts were found some Chesnuts whose wild fruit <NOTE PLACE="marg">Chesnuts.</NOTE> equalize the best in <HI>France, Spaine, Germany,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> to their tasts that had tasted them all. Plumbs there are of 3 sorts.

<P>They haue Cherries and those are much like a Damsen, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cherries.</NOTE> but for their tastes and colour we called them Cherries. we see some few Crabs, but very small and bitter.

Then haue they plenty of fruits as well planted as naturall, as corne, greene and ripe, fish, fowle, and wilde beastes exceeding fat.</P>
<P>The greatest labour they take, is in planting their corne, for the country naturally is ouergrowne with wood. To <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they pre|pare the ground</NOTE> prepare the ground they bruise the barke of the trees neare the root, then do they scortch the roots with fire that they grow no more. The next yeare with a crooked peece of wood, they beat vp the woodes by the rootes, and in that moulds they plant their corne. Their manner is this. They make a hole in the earth with a sticke, and into it they put 4 graines of wheate, and 2 of beanes. These holes they make 4 foote one from another; Their women and childre~ do continually keepe it with weeding, &amp; whe~ it is growne midle high, they hill it about like a hop-yard.</P>
<P>In Aprill they begin to plant, but their chiefe plantatio~ is in May, and so they continue till the midst of Iune. What <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they plant</NOTE> they plant in Aprill they reape in August, for May in Sep|tember, for Iune in October; Every stalke of their corne commonly beareth two eares, some 3, seldome any 4, many but one &amp; some none. Every eare ordinarily hath betwixt 200 and 500 graines. The stalke being green hath a sweet iuice in it, somewhat like a suger Cane, which is the cause that when they gather their corne greene, they sucke the stalkes: for as wee gather greene pease so doe they their corne being greene, which excelleth their old. They plant also pease they cal <HI>Assetamens,</HI> which are the same they cal in <HI>Italy', Fagioli.</HI> Their Beanes are the same the Turkes cal <HI>Garnanses,</HI> but these they much esteeme for dainties.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="14">
Their corne they rost in the eare greene, and bruising it in a morter of wood with a Polt, lappe it in rowles in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their corne.</NOTE> leaues of their corne, and so boyle it for a daintie. They also reserue that corne late planted that will not ripe, by toasting it in hot ashes, the heat thereof drying it. In win|ter they esteeme it being boyled with beans for a rare dish, they call <HI>Pausarowmena.</HI> Their old wheat they first steep a night in hot water, in the morning pounding it in a mor|ter. They vse a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the basket, receaue the flower in a platter made of wood scraped to that forme with burning and shels. Tem|pering this flower with water, they make it either in cakes couering them with ashes till they bee baked, and then washing them in faire water they drie presently with their owne heat: or else boyle them in water eating the broth with the bread which they call <HI>Ponap.</HI> The grouts and pee|ces of the cornes remaining, by fanning in a Platter or in the wind, away, the branne they boile 3 or 4 houres with water, which is an ordinary food they call <HI>Ustatahamen.</HI> But some more thrifty then cleanly, doe burne the core of the eare to powder which they call <HI>Pungnough,</HI> mingling that in their meale, but it never tasted well in bread, nor broth. Their fish and flesh they boyle either very tenderly, <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their fish and flesh.</NOTE> or broyle it so long on hurdles over the fire, or else after the <HI>Spanish</HI> fashion, putting it on a spit, they turne first the one side, then the other, til it be as drie as their ierkin beefe in the west <HI>Indies,</HI> that they may keepe it a month or more without putrifying. The broth of fish or flesh they eate as commonly as the meat.</P>
<P>In May also amongst their corne they plant Pumpeons, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Planted fruits.</NOTE> and a fruit like vnto a muske millen, but lesse and worse, which they call <HI>Macocks.</HI> These increase exceedingly, &amp; ripen in the beginning of Iuly, and continue vntil Septem|ber.

The men weare halfe their heads shaven, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The barbers.</NOTE> other halfe long; for Barbers they vse their women, who with 2 shels will grate away the haire, of any fashion they please. The women are cut in many fashions agreeable to their yeares, but ever some part remaineth long. They are <NOTE PLACE="marg">The constitution</NOTE> very strong, of an able body and full of agilitie, able to en|dure to lie in the woods vnder a tree by the fire, in the worst of winter, or in the weedes and grasse, in <HI>Am|buscado</HI> in the Sommer. They are inconstant in everie <NOTE PLACE="marg">The disposition.</NOTE> thing, but what feare constraineth them to keepe. Craftie,
<PB N="20" REF="16">
timerous, quicke of apprehensio~ &amp; very ingenuous. Some are of disposition fearefull, some bold, most cautelous, all <HI>Savage.</HI> Generally covetous of coppeer, beads, &amp; such like trash. They are soone moved to anger, and so malitious, that they seldome forget an iniury: they seldome steale one from another, least their coniurers should reueale it, and so they be pursued and punished. That they are thus feared is certaine, but that any can reueale their offences by con|iuration I am doubtfull. Their women are carefull not to bee suspected of dishonesty without the leaue of their hus|bands. Each houshold knoweth their owne lands &amp; gar|dens, and most liue of their owne labours. For their appa|rell, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The possessions</NOTE> they are some time couered with the skinnes of wilde beasts, which in winter are dressed with the haire, but in sommer without. The better sort vse large ma~tels of deare <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their attire.</NOTE> skins not much differing in fashion fro~ the Irish mantels. Some imbrodered with white beads, some with copper, o|ther painted after their manner. But the common sort haue scarce to cover their nakednesse but with grasse, the leaues of trees, or such like. We haue seen some vse mantels made of Turky feathers, so prettily wrought and wouen with threeds that nothing could bee discerned but the feathers. That was exceeding warme and very handsome. But the women are alwaies couered about their midles with a skin and very shamefast to be seene bare. They adorne the~selues most with copper beads and paintings. Their women some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their orname~ts</NOTE> haue their legs, hands, brests and face cunningly imbrode|red with diuerse workes, as beasts, serpentes, artificially wrought into their flesh with blacke spots. In each eare commonly they haue 3 great holes, whereat they hange chaines bracelets or copper. Some of their men weare in those holes, a smal greene &amp; yellow coloured snake, neare halfe a yard in length, which crawling &amp; lapping her selfe about his necke often times familiarly would kisse his lips. Others wear a dead Rat tied by the tail. So~e on their heads weare the wing of a bird, or some large feather with a Rat|tell.
<PB N="21" REF="16">
Those Rattels are somewhat like the chape of a Rapier but lesse, which they take from the taile of a snake. Many haue the whole skinne of a hawke or some strange sowle, stuffed with the wings abroad. Others a broad peece of copper, and some the hand of their enemy dryed. Their heads and shoulders are painted red with the roote <HI>Bocone</HI> braied to powder mixed with oyle, this they hold in somer to preserue them from the heate, and in winter from the cold. Many other formes of paintings they vse, but he is the most gallant that is the most monstrous to behould.</P>
<P>Their buildings &amp; habitations are for the most part by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their buildings</NOTE> the riuers or not farre distant from some fresh spring. Their houses are built like our Arbors of small young springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with mats, or the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding ei|ther winde, raine or weather, they are as warme as stooues, but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the house there is a hole made for the smoake to goe into right over the fire.</P>
<P>Against the fire they lie on little hurdles of Reedes co|vered <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their lodgings.</NOTE> with a mat borne from the ground a foote and more by a hurdle of wood. On these round about the house they lie heads and points one by that her against the fire, some covered with mats, some with skins, and some starke naked lie on the ground, from 6 to 20 in a house. Their houses are in the midst of their fields or gardens which are smal plots <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their garden.</NOTE> of ground. Some 20, some 40. some 100. some 200. some more, some lesse, some times from 2 to 100 of those houses togither, or but a little separated by groues of trees. Neere their habitations is little small-wood or old trees on the ground by reason of their burning of them for fire. So that a man may gallop a horse amongst these woods any waie, but where the creekes or Rivers shall hinder.</P>
<P>Men women and children haue their severall names ac|cording <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they vse their children.</NOTE> to the seuerall humor of their Parents. Their wo|men (they say) are easilie deliuered of childe, yet doe they
<PB N="22" REF="17">
loue children verie dearly. To make them hardy, in the col|dest mornings they the~ wash in the riuers and by painting and ointments so canne their skins, that after a year or two, no weather will hurt them.</P>
<P>The men bestowe their times in fishing, hunting, wars &amp; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The industry of their women.</NOTE> such manlike exercises, scorning to be seene in any woma~ like exercise, which is the cause that the women be verie painefull and the men often idle. The women and children do the rest of the worke. They make mats, baskets, pots, morters, pound their corne, make their bread, prepare their victuals, plant their corne, gather their corne, beare al kind of burdens and such like.</P>
<P>Their fire they kindle presently by chasing a dry poin|ted sticke in a hole of a little square peece of wood, that fi|ring <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they strike fire.</NOTE> it selfe, will so fire mosse, leaues, or anie such like drie thing, that will quickly burne. In March and Aprill they liue much vpon their fishing, weares, and feed on fish, Tur|kies <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their order of diet.</NOTE> and squirrels. In May and Iune they plant their fieldes and liue most of Acornes, walnuts, and fish. But to mend their diet, some disperse themselues in small companies &amp; liue vpon fish, beasts, crabs, oysters, land Torteyses, straw|berries, mulberries, &amp; such like. In Iune, Iulie, and August they feed vpon the rootes of <HI>Tocknough</HI> berries, fish and greene wheat. It is strange to see how their bodies alter with their diet, euen as the deare and wilde beastes they seeme fat and leane, strong and weak. <HI>Powhatan</HI> their great king and some others that are provident, rost their fish and flesh vpon hurdles as before is expressed, and keepe it till scarce times.</P>
<P>For fishing and hunting and warres they vse much their bow and arrowes. They bring their bowes to the forme of <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they make their bowes and arrowes.</NOTE> ours by the scraping of a shell. Their arrowes are made some of straight young sprigs which they head with bone, some 2 or 3 inches long. These they vse to shoot at squir|rels on trees. An other sort of arrowes they vse made of reeds. These are peeced with wood, headed with splinters
<PB N="23" REF="17">
of christall or some sharpe stone, the spurres of a Turkey, or the bill of some bird. For his knife he hath the splinter <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their kniues.</NOTE> of a reed to cut his feathers in forme. With this knife also, he will ioint a Deare or any beast, shape his shooes, bus|kins, mantels, &amp;c. To make the noch of his arrow hee hath the tooth of a Beuer, set in a sticke, wherewith he grateth it by degrees, His arrow head he quickly maketh with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his bracer, of any splint of a stone, or glasse in the forme of a hart and these they glew to the end of their arrowes. With the sinewes of Deare, and the tops of Deares hornes boiled to a ielly, they make a glew that will not dissolue in cold water.</P>
<P>For their wars also they vse Targets that are round and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Targets and Swords.</NOTE> made of the barkes of trees, and a sworde of wood at their backs, but oftentimes they vse for swords the horne of a Deare put through a peece of wood in forme of a Pickaxe. Some a long stone sharpned at both ends vsed in the same manner. This they were wont to vse also for hatchets, but now by trucking they haue plenty of the same forme of y|ron. And those are their chiefe instruments and armes.</P>
<P>Their fishing is much in Boats. These they make of one <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their boats.</NOTE> tree by bowing &amp; scratching away the coles with stons &amp; shels till they haue made it in forme of a Trough. Some of them are an elne deepe, and 40 or 50 foot in length, and some will beare 40 men, but the most ordinary are smaller and will beare 10, 20, or 30. according to their bignes. In|steed of oares, they vse paddles and sticks with which they will row faster then our Barges. Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin, the barks of trees, deare <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they spin.</NOTE> sinews, or a kind of grasse they call <HI>Pemmenaw,</HI> of these they make a thred very even &amp; readily. This thred serveth for many vses. As about their housing, apparell, as also they make nets for fishing, for the quantity as formally braded as ours. They make also with it lines for angles. Their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their fishooker.</NOTE> hookes are either a bone grated as they nock, their arrows in the forme of a crooked pinne or fishook or, of the splin|ter
<PB N="24" REF="18">
of a bone tied to the clift of a litle stick, and with the ende of the line, they tie on the bate. They vse also long arrowes tyed in a line wherewith they shoote at fish in the rivers. But they of <HI>Accawmack</HI> vse staues like vnto Iave|lins headed with bone. With these they dart fish swim|ming in the water. They haue also many artificiall weares in which they get abundance of fish.</P>
<P>In their hunting and fishing they take extreame paines; yet it being their ordinary exercise from their infancy, they esteeme it a pleasure and are very proud to be expert there|in. And by their continuall ranging, and travel, they know all the advantages and places most frequented with Deare, Beasts, Fish, Foule, Rootes, and Berries. At their huntings they leaue their habitations, and reduce themselues into companies, as the <HI>Tartars</HI> doe, and goe to the most desert <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they hunt</NOTE> places with their families, where they spend their time in hunting and fowling vp towards the mountaines, by the heads of their riuers, where there is plentie of game. For betwixt the rivers the grounds are so narrowe, that little commeth there which they devoure not. It is a marvel they can so directly passe these deserts, some 3 or 4 daies iour|ney without habitation. Their hunting houses are like vn|to Arbours couered with mats. These their women beare after them, with Corne, Acornes, Morters, and all bag and baggage they vse. Whe~ they come to the place of exercise, euery man doth his best to shew his dexteritie, for by their excelling in those quallities, they get their wiues. Forty yards will they shoot leuell, or very neare the mark, and 120 is their best at Random. At their huntings in the de|serts they are commonly 2 or 300 together. Hauing found the Deare, they enuiron them with many fires, and betwixt the fires they place themselues. And some take their stands in the midst. The Deare being thus feared by the fires and their voices, they chace them so long within that circle that many times they kill 6, 8, 10, or 15 at a hunting. They vse also to driue them into some narrowe point of land;
<PB N="25" REF="18">
when they find that aduantage and so force them into the riuer, where with their boats they haue <HI>Ambuscadoes</HI> to kill them. When they haue shot a Deare by land, they fol|low him like blood hounds by the blood and straine and oftentimes so take them. Hares, Pattridges, Turkies, or Egges, fat or leane, young or old, they devoure all they ca~ catch in their power. In one of these huntings they found Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> in the discoverie of the head of the river of <HI>Chickahamania,</HI> where they slew his men, and tooke him prisoner in a Bogmire, where he saw those exercises, &amp; ga|thered these observations.</P>
<P>One Savage hunting alone, vseth the skinne of a Deare <NOTE PLACE="marg">One Savage hun|ting alone.</NOTE> slit on the one side, and so put on his arme, through the neck, so that his hand comes to the head which is stuffed, and the hornes, head, eies, eares, and every part as artefici|ally counterfeited as they can devise. Thus shrowding his body in the skinne by stalking he approacheth the Deare, creeping on the ground from one tree to another. If the Deare chance to find fault, or stande at gaze, hee turneth the head with his hand to his best advantage to seeme like a Deare, also gazing and licking himselfe. So watching his best aduantage to approach, hauing shot him, hee chaseth him by his blood and straine till he get him.</P>
<P>When they intend any warres, the <HI>Werowances</HI> vsually <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their consulta|tions.</NOTE> haue the advice of their Priests and Coniurers, and their Allies and ancient friends, but chiefely the Priestes deter|mine their rosolution. Every <HI>Werowance,</HI> or some lustie fel|low, they appoint Captaine over every nation. They sel|dome make warre for lands or goods, but for women and children, and principally for revenge. They haue many eni|mies, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their enimies</NOTE> namely all their westernely Countries beyond the mountaines, and the heads of the rivers. Vpon the head of the <HI>Powhatans</HI> are the <HI>Monacans,</HI> whose chiefe habitation is at <HI>Russawmeake,</HI> vnto whome the <HI>Mouhemenchughes,</HI> the <HI>Massinnacacks,</HI> the <HI>Monahassanuggs,</HI> and other nations pay tributs.

For the heads of all those riuers, especially the <HI>Patta|womekes,</HI> the <HI>Pautuxuntes.</HI> The <HI>Sasquesahanocks,</HI> the <HI>Tock|woughes</HI> are continually tormented by them: of whose cru|eltie, they generally complained, and very importunate they were with Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> and his company to free <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their offer of subiection.</NOTE> them from these tormentors. To this purpose they offered food, conduct, assistance, &amp; continuall subiectio~. To which he concluded to effect, But the counsell then present emu|lating his successe, would not thinke it fit to spare him 40 men to be hazarded in those vnknowne regions, hauing passed (as before was spoken of) but with 12, &amp; so was lost that opportunitie. Seaven boats full of these <HI>Massawomeks</HI> the discouerers encountred at the head of the <HI>Bay;</HI> whose Targets, Baskets, Swords, Tobaccopipes, Platters, Bowes and Arrowes, and euery thing shewed, they much excee|deed them of our parts, and their dexteritie in their small boats made of the barkes of trees sowed with barke and well luted with gumme, argueth that they are seated vpon some great water.</P>
<P>Against all these enimies the <HI>Powhatans</HI> are constrai|ned sometimes to fight. Their chiefe attempts are by Stra|tagems, trecheries, or surprisals. Yet the <HI>Werowances,</HI> wo|men and children they put not to death but keepe them Captiues, They haue a method in warre and for our plea|sures
<PB N="27" REF="19">
they shewd it vs, and it was in this manner perfor|med at <HI>Mattapanient.</HI></P>
<P>Having painted and disguised themselues in the fiercest <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of battell.</NOTE> manner they could devise. They divided themselues into two Companies, neare a 100 in a company. The one com|pany Called <HI>Monacans,</HI> the other <HI>Powhatans.</HI> Either army had their Captaine. These as enimies tooke their stands a musket shot one from another; ranked themselues 15 a breast and each ranke from another 4 or 5 yards, not in fyle, but in the opening betwixt their fyles, So as the Reare could shoot as conueniently as the Front. Hauing thus pit ched the fields: from either part went a Messenger with these conditions, that whosoever were vanquished, such as escape vpon their submission in 2 daies after should liue, but their wiues and children should be prize for the Con|querers. The messengers were no sooner returned, but they approached in their orders; On each flanke a Sarieant, and in the Reare an officer for levitenant, all duly keeping their orders, yet leaping &amp; singing after their accustomed tune which they vse only in warres. Vpon the first flight of ar|rowes they gaue such horrible shouts and screeches, as though so many infernall helhounds could not haue made them more terrible. When they had spent their arrowes they ioined together prettily, charging and retiring, every ranke seconding other. As they got advantage they cat|ched their enimies by the haire of the head, and downe he came that was taken. His enimie with his wooden sword seemed to beat out his braines, and still they crept to the Reare, to maintaine the skirmish. The <HI>Monacans</HI> decrea|sing, the <HI>Powhatans</HI> charged them in the forme of a halfe moone; they vnwilling to be inclosed, fled all in a troope to their <HI>Ambuscadoes</HI> on whome they led them very cun|ninngly. The <HI>Monacans</HI> disperse themselues among the fresh men, wherevpon the <HI>Powhatans</HI> retired, with al speed to their seconds; which the <HI>Monacans</HI> seeing, took that ad|vantage to retire againe to their owne battell, and so each
<PB N="28" REF="20">
returned to their owne quarter. All their actions, voices &amp; gestures, both in charging and retiring were so strained to the hight of their quallitie and nature, that the strangenes thereof made it seem very delightfull.</P>
<P>For their musicke they vse a thicke cane, on which they pipe as on a Recorder. For their warres they haue a great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Musicke</NOTE> deepe platter of wood. They cover the mouth thereof with a skin, at each corner they tie a walnut, which meeting on the backside neere the bottome, with a small rope they twitch the~ togither till it be so tought and stiffe, that they may beat vpon it as vpo~ a drumme. But their chiefe instru|ments are Rattels made of small gourds or Pu~pions shels. Of these they haue Base, Tenor, Countertenor, Meane and Trible. These mingled with their voices sometimes 20 or 30 togither, make such a terrible noise as would rather af|fright then delight any man. If any great comma~der arriue <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their entertain ment.</NOTE> at the habitation of a <HI>Werowance,</HI> they spread a mat as the Turkes do a carpet for him to sit vpon. Vpo~ an other right opposite they sit themselues. Then doe all with a tuna|ble voice of showting bid him welcome. After this doe 2. or more of their chiefest men make an oration, testifying their loue. Which they do with such vehemency &amp; so great passions, that they sweate till they drop, and are so out of breath they can scarce speake. So that a man would take them to be exceeding angry or starke mad. Such victuall as they haue, they spend freely, &amp; at night where his lodging is appointed, they set a woman fresh painted red with <HI>Po|cones</HI> and oile, to be his bedfellow.</P>
<P>Their manner of trading is for copper, beades, and such like, for which they giue such commodities as they haue, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their trade.</NOTE> as skins, fowle, fish, flesh, and their cou~try corne. But their victuall is their chiefest riches.</P>
<P>Every spring they make themselues sicke with drinking the iuice of a root they call <HI>wighsacan,</HI> and water, whereof <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their phisicke.</NOTE> they powre so great a quantity, that it purgeth them in a very violent maner; so that in 3 or 4 daies after they scarce

recover their former health.

For swel|lings also they vse swal peeces of touchwood, in the forme of cloues, which pricking on the griefe they burne close to the flesh, and from thence draw the corruption with their mouth. With this root <HI>wighsacan</HI> they ordinarily heal greene wounds. But to scarrifie a swelling or make incisi|on their best instruments are some splinted stone. Old vl|cers or putrified hurtes are seldome seene cured amongst the~. They haue many professed Phisitions, who with their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their charmes to cure.</NOTE> charmes and Rattels with an infernall rowt of words and actions will seeme to sucke their inwarde griefe from their navels or their grieved places; but of our Chirurgians they were so conceipted, that they beleeued any Plaister would heale any hurt.</P>

<P>There is yet in <HI>Uirginia</HI> no place discouered to bee so <HI>Savage</HI> in which the <HI>Savages</HI> haue not a religion, Deare, and Bow, and Arrowes. All things that were able to do the~ hurt beyond their prevention, they adore with their kinde of diuine worship; as the fire, water, lightning, thunder, our ordinance, peeces, horses, &amp;c. But their chiefe God they worship is the Diuell. Him they call <HI>Oke</HI> &amp; serue him more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their God.</NOTE> of feare then loue. They say they haue co~ference with him, and fashion themselues as neare to his shape as they can i|magine. In their Temples they haue his image euill favou|redly carued, and then painted and adorned with chaines copper, and beades, and couered with a skin, in such ma~ner as the deformity may well suit with such a God. By him is commonly the sepulcher of their kings. Their bodies are <NOTE PLACE="marg">How they bury their kings.</NOTE> first bowelled, then dryed vpon hurdles till they bee verie dry, and so about the most of their iointes and necke they hang bracelets or chaines of copper, pearle, and such like,
<PB N="30" REF="21">
as they vse to weare, their inwards they stuffe with copper beads and couered with a skin, hatchets and such trash. Then lappe they them very carefully in white skins and so rowle them in mats for their wineding sheetes. And in the Tombe which is an arch made of mats, they lay them or|derly. What remaineth of this kinde of wealth their kings haue, they set at their feet in baskets. These Temples and bodies are kept by their Priests.</P>
<P>For their ordinary burials they digge a deep hole in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their ordinary burials.</NOTE> earth with sharpe stakes and the corpes being lapped in skins &amp; mats with their iewels, they lay them vpon sticks in the ground, and so couer them with earth. The buriall ended, the women being painted all their faces with black cole and oile, doe sit 24 howers in the houses mourning &amp; lamenting by turnes, with such yelling &amp; howling as may expresse their great passions.</P>
<P>In every Territory of a <HI>werowance</HI> is a Temple &amp; a Priest 2 or 3 or more.

<P>Vpon the top of certaine redde sandy hils in the woods. There are 3 great houses filled with images of their kings and Divels and Tombes of their Predecessors. Those hou|ses are neare 60 foot in length built arbor wise after their building. This place they count so holy as that but the Priestes and kings dare come into them; nor the <HI>Savages</HI> dare not go vp the river in boats by it, but that they sole~n|ly cast some peece of copper white beads or <HI>Pocones</HI> into the river, for feare their <HI>Oke</HI> should be offended and reve~|ged of them.</P>
<P>In this place commonly is resident 7 Priests. The chiefe differed from the rest in his ornaments, but inferior Priests <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their orname~ts for their Priests</NOTE> could hardly be knowne from the co~mon people, but that they had not so many holes in their eares to hang their ie|wels at. The ornaments of the chiefe Priest was certain at|tires for his head made thus. They tooke a dosen or 16 or
<PB N="31" REF="21">
more snake skins and stuffed them with mosse, and of wee|sels and other vermine skins a good many. All these they tie by their tailes, so as all their tailes meete in the toppe of their head, like a great Tassell. Round about this Tassell is as it were a crown of feathers, the skins hang round about his head necke and shoulders and in a manner cover his face. The faces of all their Priests are painted as vgly as they can devise, in their hands they had every one his Rat|tell, some base, some smaller. Their devotion was most in songs which the chiefe Priest beginneth and the rest fol|lowed him, sometimes he maketh invocations with broke~ sentences by starts and strange passions, &amp; at every pause, the rest giue a short groane.</P>
<P>It could not bee perceiued that they keepe any day as more holy then other; But only in some great distresse of want, feare of enimies, times of triumph and gathering to|gither <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their times of solemnities.</NOTE> their fruits, the whole country of men women and children come togither to solemnities. The manner of their devotion is, sometimes to make a great fire, in the house or fields, and all to sing and dance about it with rat|tles and shouts togither, 4 or 5 houres. Sometime they set a man in the midst, and about him they dance and sing, he all the while clapping his hands as if he would keepe time, &amp; after their songs and dauncings ended they goe to their Feasts.</P>
<P>They haue also diuers coniurations one they made whe~ <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their coniura|tions.</NOTE> Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> was their prisoner (as they reported) to know if any more of his countrymen would ariue there, &amp; what he there intended. The manner of it was thus. First they made a faire fire in a house; about this fire set 7 Priests setting him by them, and about the fire, they made a circle of meale. That done the chiefe Priest attired as is expressed began to shake his rattle, and the rest followed him in his song. At the end of the song, he laid downe 5 or 3 graines of wheat and so continued counting his songs by the graines, till 3 times they incirculed the fire, then they di|vided
<PB N="32" REF="22">
the graines by certaine numbers with little stickes, laying downe at the ende of euery song a little sticke.

Their Coniurers runne to the wa|ter sides, or passing in their boats, after many hellish out|cries and invocations, they cast Tobacco, Copper, <HI>Pocones</HI> or such trash into the water, to pacifie that God whome they thinke to be very angry in those stormes. Before their dinners and suppers the better sort will take the first bit, and cast it in the fire, which is all the grace they are known to vse.</P>
<P>In some part of the Country they haue yearely a sacri|fice of children. Such a one was at <HI>Quiyoughcohanock</HI> some 10 miles from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne and thus performed. Fifteene <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their solemne sacrifices of children.</NOTE> of the properest young boyes, betweene 10 and 15 yeares of age they painted white. Hauing brought them forth the people spent the forenoone in dancing and singing about them with rattles. In the afternoone they put those childre~ to the roote of a tree. By them all the men stood in a guard, every one hauing a Bastinado in his hand, made of reeds bound together. This made a lane betweene them all a|long, through which there were appointed 5 young men
<PB N="33" REF="22">
to fetch these childre~: so every one of the fiue we~t through the guard to fetch a child each after other by turnes, the guard fearelesly beating them with their Bastinadoes, and they patiently enduring and receauing all, defending the children with their naked bodies from the vnmercifull blowes that pay them soundly though the children escape. All this while the women weepe and crie out very passio|nately, prouiding mats, skinnes, mosse, and drie wood, as things fitting their childrens funerals. After the children were thus passed the guard, the guard tore down the trees, branches, and boughs, with such violence that they rent the body, and made wreathes for their heads, or bedecked their haire with the leaues. What else was done with the childron, was nonseene, but they were all cast on a heape, in a valley as dead, where they made a great feast for al the company. The <HI>Werowance</HI> being demanded the meaning of this sacrifice, answered that the children were not al dead, but that the <HI>Oke</HI> or <HI>Divell</HI> did sucke the blood from their left breast, who chanced to be his by lot, till they were dead, but the rest were kept in the wildernesse by the yong men till nine moneths were expired, during which time they must not conuerse with any, and of these were made their Priests and Coniurers. This sacrifice they held to bee so necessarie, that if they should omit it, their <HI>Oke</HI> or Divel and all their other <HI>Quiyoughcosughes</HI> which are their other Gods, would let them haue no Deare, Turkies, Corne, nor fish, and yet besides, hee would make a great slaughter a|mongst them.</P>
<P>They thinke that their <HI>Werowances</HI> and Priestes which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their resurre|ction.</NOTE> they also esteeme <HI>Quiyoughcosughes,</HI> when they are dead, doe goe beyound the mountaines towardes the setting of the sun, and euer remaine there in forme of their <HI>Oke,</HI> with their heads painted with oile and <HI>Pocones,</HI> finely trim|med with feathers, and shal haue beades, hatchets, copper, and tobacco, doing nothing but dance and sing, with all their Predecessors. But the common people they suppose
<PB N="34" REF="23">
shall not liue after death.</P>
<P>To diuert them from this blind idolatrie, many vsed their best indeauours, chiefly with the <HI>Werowances</HI> of <HI>Qui|youghcohanock,</HI> whose devotion, apprehension, and good disposition, much exceeded any in those Countries, who though we could not as yet preuaile withall to forsake his false Gods, yet this de did beleeue that our God as much exceeded theirs, as our Gunnes did their Bowes &amp; Arrows and many times did send to the President, at <HI>Iames</HI> towne, men with presents, intreating them to pray to his God for raine, for his Gods would not send him any. And in this la|mentable ignorance doe these poore soules sacrifice them selues to the Diuell, not knowing their Creator.</P>

<HEAD>Of the manner of the Virginians governement.</HEAD>
<P>Although the countrie people be very barbarous, yet haue they amongst them such governement, as that their Magistrats for good commanding, and their people for du subiection, and obeying, excell many places that would be counted very civill. The forme of their Common wealth is a monarchicall gouernement, one as Emperour ruleth o|uer many kings or governours. Their chiefe ruler is called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and taketh his name of the principall place of dwelling called <HI>Powhatan.</HI> But his proper name is <HI>Wahun|sonacock.</HI> Some countries he hath which haue been his an|cestors, and came vnto him by inheritance, as the countrie called <HI>Powhatan, Arrohateck, Appamatuke, Pamavuke, Youghtanud,</HI> and <HI>Mattapanient.</HI> All the rest of his Terri|tories expressed in the Map, they report haue beene his se|uerall conquests. In all his ancient inheritances, hee hath houses built after their manner like arbours, some 30 some 40 yardes long, and at euery house provision for his enter|tainement according to the time. At <HI>Werowcomoco,</HI> he was seated vpon the Northside of the riuer <HI>Pamavuke,</HI> some 14 miles from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, where for the most part, hee was resident, but he tooke so little pleasure in our neare neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="35" REF="23">
that were able to visit him against his will in 6 or 7 houres, that he retired himself to a place in the deserts at the top of the riuer <HI>Chickahamania</HI> betweene <HI>Youghta|nund</HI> &amp; <HI>Powhatan.</HI> His habitation there is called <HI>Orapacks</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">A description of Powhatan.</NOTE> where he ordinarily now resideth. He is of parsonage a tall well proportioned man, with a sower looke, his head som|what gray, his beard so thinne that it seemeth none at al, his age neare 60; of a very able and hardy body to endure any labour. About his person ordinarily attendeth a guard of 40 or 50 of the tallest men his Country doth afford. E|very <NOTE PLACE="marg">His attendance and watch.</NOTE> night vpon the 4 quarters of his house are 4 Sentinels each standing from other a flight shoot, and at euery halfe houre one from the Corps du guard doth hollowe, vnto whome every Sentinell doth answer round from his stand; if any faile, they presently send forth an officer that beateth him extreamely.</P>
<P>A mile from <HI>Orapakes</HI> in a thicket of wood hee hath a house in which he keepeth his kind of Treasure, as skinnes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">His treasuris.</NOTE> copper, pearle, and beades, which he storeth vp against the time of his death and buriall. Here also is his store of red paint for ointment, and bowes and arrowes. This house is 50 or 60 yards in length, frequented only by Priestes. At the 4 corners of this housestand 4 Images as Sentinels, one of a Dragon, another a Beare, the 3 like a Leopard, and the fourth like a giantlike man, all made euillfauordly, accor|ding to their best workmanship.</P>
<P>He hath as many women as he will, whereof when hee <NOTE PLACE="marg">His wiues.</NOTE> lieth on his bed, one sitteth at his head, and another at his feet, but when he sitteth, one sitteth on his right hand and another on his left. As he is wearie of his women, hee be|stoweth them on those that best deserue them at his hands. When he dineth or suppeth, one of his women before and after meat, bringeth him water in a woden platter to wash his hands. Another waiteth with a bunch of feathers to wipe them insteed of a Towell, and the feathers when he hath wiped are dryed againe. His kingdome des|cendeth

not to his sonnes nor children, but first to his bre|thren, whereof he hath 3. namely <HI>Opitchapan, Opechanca|nough,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">His successors</NOTE> and <HI>Catataugh,</HI> and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister then to the rest and after the~ to the heires male and female of the eldest sister, but never to the heires of the males.</P>
<P>He nor any of his people vnderstand any letters wherby to write or read, only the lawes whereby he ruleth is cu|stome. Yet when he listeth his will is a law and must bee o|beyed: not only as a king but as halfe a God they esteeme <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their authority</NOTE> him. His inferiour kings whom they cal <HI>werowances</HI> are ty|ed to rule by customes, and haue power of life &amp; death as their command in that nature. But this word <HI>Werowance</HI> which we call and conster for a king, is a common worde whereby they call all commanders for they haue but fewe words in their language, and but few occasions to vse anie officers more then one commander, which commo~ly they call <HI>werowances.</HI> They all knowe their severall landes, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The tenor of their lands.</NOTE> habitations, and limits, to fish, sowle, or hunt in, but they hold all of their great <HI>Werowances Powhatan,</HI> vnto whome they pay tribute of skinnes, beades, copper, pearle, deare, turkies, wild beasts, and corne. What he commandeth they dare not disobey in the least thing. It is strange to see with what great feare and adoration all these people doe obay this <HI>Powhatan.</HI> For at his feet they present whatsoever hee commandeth, and at the least frowne of his browe, their greatest spirits will tremble with feare: and no maruell, for he is very terrible and tyrannous in punishing such as of|fend him. For example hee caused certaine malefactors to be bound hand and foot, then hauing of many fires gathe|red <NOTE PLACE="marg">His maner of punishments.</NOTE> great store of burning coles, they rake these coles rou~d in the forme of a cockpit, and in the midst they cast the of|fenders to broyle to death. Somtimes he causeth the heads of them that offend him, to be laid vpon the altar or sacrifi|cing stone, and one with clubbes beates out their braines. When he would punish any notorious enimie or malefac|tor,
<PB N="37" REF="24">
he causeth him to be tied to a tree, &amp; with muscle shels or reeds, the executioner outteth of his ioints one after an|other, euer casting what they cut of into the fire; then doth he proceed with shels and reeds to case the skinne from his head and face; then doe they rip his belly and so burne him with the tree and all. Thus themselues reported they exe|cuted <HI>George Cassen.</HI> Their ordinary correction is to beate them with cudgels. Wee haue seene a man kneeling on his knees, and at <HI>Powhatans</HI> command, two men haue beat him on the bare skin, till he hath fallen senselesse in a sound, &amp; yet neuer cry nor complained.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1608, hee surprised the people of <HI>Payanka|tank</HI> his neare neighbours and subiects. The occasion was to vs vnknowne, but the manner was thus. First he sent di|verse of his men as to lodge amongst them that night, then the <HI>Ambuscadoes</HI> inuironed al their houses, &amp; at the houre appointed, they all fell to the spoile, 24 men they slewe, the long haire of the one side of their heades with the skinne cased off with shels or reeds, they brought away. They sur|prised also the women &amp; the children and the <HI>Werowance.</HI> All these they present to <HI>Powhatan.</HI> The <HI>Werowance,</HI> wome~ and children became his prisoners, &amp; doe him service. The lockes of haire with their skinnes he hanged on a line vnto two trees. And thus he made oftentation of as great a tri|umph at <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> shewing them to the Emglish men that then came vnto him at his appointment, they expec|ting provision, he to betray them, supposed to halfe con|quer them by this spectacle of his terrible crueltie.</P>
<P>And this is as much as my memory can call to mind wor+thie of note; which I haue purposely collected, to satisfie my friends of the true worth and qualitie of <HI>Virginia.</HI> Yet some bad natures will not sticke to slander the Countrey; that will slovenly spit at all things, especially in company where they ca~ find none to contradict them. Who though they were scarse euer 10 miles from <HI>Iames</HI> Town, or at the most but at the falles; yet holding it a great disgrace that

amongst so much action, their actions were nothing, ex|claime of all things, though they never adventured to knowe any thing; nor euer did any thing but devoure the fruits of other mens labours. Being for most part of such tender educations and small experience in martiall acci|dents, because they found not English cities, nor such faire houses, nor at their owne wishes any of their accustomed dainties, with feather beds and downe pillowes, Tavernes and alehouses in every breathing place, neither such plen|ty of gold and siluer and dissolute liberty as they expected, had little or no care of any thing, but to pamper their bel|lies, to fly away with our Pinnaces, or procure their means to returne for England. For the Country was to them a mi|serie, a ruine, a death, a hell, and their reports here, &amp; their owne actions there according.</P>
<P>Some other there were that had yearely stipends to pass to and againe for transportation: who to keepe the myste|ry of the businesse in themselues, though they had neither time nor meanes to knowe much of themselues; yet al me~s actions or relations they so formally tuned to the tempo|rizing times simplicitie, as they could make their ignoran|ces seeme much more, then al the true actors could by their experience. And those with their great words deluded the world with such strange promises as abused the businesse much worse then the rest. For the businesse being builded vpon the foundation of their fained experience, the plan|ters, the mony, tinne, and meanes haue still miscaried: yet they ever returning, and the Planters so farre absent, who could contradict their excuses? which stil to maintain their vaineglory and estimation, from time to time they haue v|sed such diligence as made them passe for truthes, though nothing more false. And that the adve~turers might be thus abused, let no man wonder; for the wisest liuing is soonest abused by him that hath a faire tongue and a dissembling heart.</P>
<P>There were many in <HI>Virginia</HI> meerely proiecting, verbal
<PB N="39" REF="25">
and idle contemplatours, and thoseso deuoted to pure idle nesse, that though they had lived two or three yeares in <HI>Virginia,</HI> lordly, necessitie it selfe could not compell them to passe the <HI>Peninsula,</HI> or <HI>Pallisadoes</HI> of <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, and those wittie spirits, what would they not affirme in the be|halfe of our transporters to get victuall from their ships, or obtaine their good words in <HI>England</HI> to get their passes. Thus from the clamors and the ignorance of false infor|mers, are sprung those disasters that sprung in <HI>Virginia,</HI> and our ingenious verbalists were no lesse plague to vs in <HI>Uir|ginia,</HI> then the Locusts to the Egyptians. For the labour of 30 of the best only preserued in Christianitie by their indu strie the idle livers of neare 200 of the rest: who liuing neer 10 months of such naturall meanes, as the Country natu|rally of it selfe afforded, notwithstanding all this, and the worst furie of the Savages, the extremitie of sicknesse, mu|tinies, faction, ignorances, and want of victuall; in all that time I lost but 7 or 8 men, yet subiected the Savages to our desired obedience, and receaued contribution from 35 of their kings, to protect and assist the~ against any that should assalt them, in which order they continued true &amp; faithful, and as subiects to his Maiestie, so long after as I did gouern there, vntill I left the Country: since, how they haue revol|ted, the Countrie lost, and againe replanted, and the busi|nesses hath succeeded from time to time, I referre you to the relations of them returned from <HI>Virginia,</HI> that haue bin more diligent in such observations.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_LOng hath the world longed, but to be truely satisfied what Virginia is, with the truth of those proceedings, from whence hath flowne so manie reports of worth, &amp; yet few good ef|fects of the charge, which hath cau|sed suspition in many well willers that desire yet but to be truely satis|fied therein. If any can resolue this doubt it is those that haue lived residents in the land: not salers, or passengers, nor such mercinary contemplators, that only bedeck them|selues with others plumes. This discourse is not from such, neither am I the author, for they are many, whose particu|lar discourses are signed by their names. This solid trea|tise, first was compiled by <HI>Richard Pots,</HI> since passing the hands of many to pervse, cha~cing into my hands, (for that I know them honest men, and can partly well witnesse their relations true) I could do no lesse in charity to the world the~ reveale; nor in co~science, but approue. By the advise of ma|ny graue and vnderstanding gentlemen, that haue pressed it, to the presse, it was thought fit to publish it, rather in it owne rude phrase then other waies. For that nothing can so purge that famous action from the infamous scandal some ignorantly haue conceited, as the plaine simple and naked truth. For defect whereof the businesse is still suspected, the truth vnknowne, and the best deservers discouraged, and neglected, some by false reports, others by coniecture, and such power hath flattry to ingender of those, hatred and af|fection, that one is sufficent to beguile more, then 500 can
<PB REF="28">
keepe from being deceiued.</P>
<P>But this discourse is no Iudge of mens manners, nor ca|talogue of their former courses; only a reporter of their acti|ons in Virginia, not to disgrace any, accuse any, excuse any, nor flatter any; for which cause there is no wrong done but this, shortnesse in complaining, &amp; so sparing in co~mending as only the reader may perceiue the truth for his paines, &amp; the action purged of foule slander; it can detract from none that intendeth there to adventure their fortunes; and to speake truly of the first planters, that brake the yee &amp; beate the path, howsoeuer many difficulties obscured their inde|vours, he were worse then the worst of Ingrates, that would not spare them memory that haue buried themselues in those forrain regions. From whose first adventures may spring more good blessings then are yet conceived. So I rest thine, that will read, pervse, &amp; vnderstand me. If you finde false orthography or broken English, they are small faultes in souldiers, that not being able to write learnedly, onlie striue to speake truely, and be vnderstood without an In|terpreter.</P>

<P>_IT might wel be thought, a coun|trie so faire (as <HI>Virginia</HI> is) and a people so tractable, would long ere this haue beene quietly pos|sessed, to the satisfaction of the adventurers, and the eternizing of the memorie of those that af|fected it. But because all the world doe see a defaile|ment; this following Treatise shall giue satisfaction to all indifferent readers, how the businesse hath beene carried, where no doubt they will easily vnderstand and answer to their question, howe it came to passe there was no better speed and successe in those pro|ceedings.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Bartholomew Gosnold,</HI> the first mover of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The first mouer of the action.</NOTE> this plantation, hauing many yeares solicited many of his friends, but found small assistants; at last prevai|led with some Gentlemen, as M^r <HI>Edward-maria Wing|field,</HI> Captaine <HI>Iohn Smith,</HI> and diverse others who de|pended a yeare vpon his proiects, but nothing could be effected, till by their great charge and industrie it came to be apprehended by certaine of the Nobilitie,

Gentrie, and Marchants, so that his Maiestie by his letters patents, gaue commission for establishing Councels, to direct here, and to governe, and to exe|cute there; to effect this, was spent another yeare, and by that time, three ships were provided, one of 100 Tonns, another of 40. and a Pinnace of 20. The trans|portation of the company was committed to Cap|taine <HI>Christopher Newport,</HI> a Marriner well practised for the westerne parts of <HI>America.</HI> But their orders for gouernement were put in a box, not to be opened, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Orders for go|vernment.</NOTE> nor the governours knowne vntill they arived in <HI>Vir|ginia.</HI></P>
<P>On the 19 of December, 1606. we set saile, but by vnprosperous winds, were kept six weekes in the sight of England; all which time, <HI>M^r Hunt</HI> our Preacher, was so weake and sicke, that few expected his recove|rie. Yet although he were but 10 or 12 miles from his habitation (the time we were in the downes) and not|withstanding the stormie weather, nor the scandalous imputations (of some few, little better then Atheists, of the greatest ranke amongst vs) suggested against him, all this could never force from him so much as a seeming desire to leaue the busines, but preferred the service of God, in so good a voyage, before any affec|tion to contest with his godlesse foes, whose disaste|rous designes (could they haue prevailed) had even then overthrowne the businesse, so many discontents did then arise, had he not with the water of patience, and his godly exhortations (but chiefly by his true de|voted examples) quenched those flames of envie, and dissention.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="29">
Wee watred at the Canaries, wee traded with the Salvages at <HI>Dominica;</HI> three weekes we spent in refre|shing ourselus amongst these west-India Iles; in <HI>Gwar|dalupa</HI> we found a bath so hot, as in it we boiled porck as well as over the fire. And at a little Ile called <HI>Moni|ca,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Monica an vn|frequented Ile full of birds.</NOTE> we tooke from the bushes with our hands, neare 2 hogshheads full of birds in 3 or 4 houres. In <HI>Mevis, Mona,</HI> and the Virgin Iles, we spent some time, where|with a lothsome beast like a Crocadil, called a Gwayn, Tortoses, Pellicans, Parrots, &amp; fishes, we daily feasted. Gone from thence in search of <HI>Virginia,</HI> the compa|ny was not a little discomforted, seeing the Marriners had three daies passed their reckoning and found no land, so that Captaine <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> (Captaine of the Pin|nace) rather desired to beare vp the helme to returne for England, then make further search. But God the guider of all good actions, forcing the~ by an extream storme to hul all night, did driue them by his provi|dence to their desired port, bey ond all their expecta|tions, for never any of them had seene that coast. The first land they made they called <HI>Cape Henry;</HI> where anc|horing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their first lan|ding.</NOTE> <HI>M^r Wingfeild, Gosnoll,</HI> and <HI>Newport,</HI> with 30 others, recreating themselues on shore, were assalted by 5 Salvages, who hurt 2 of the English very dange|rously. That night was the box opened, and the or|ders read, in which <HI>Barthelomew Gosnoll, Edward Wing|feild, Christopher Newport, Iohn Smith, Iohn Ratliffe, Iohn Martin,</HI> and <HI>George Kendall,</HI> were named to bee the Councell, and to choose a President amongst them for a yeare, who with the Councell should governe. Matters of moment were to be examined by a Jurie, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Matters of go|vernment.</NOTE>
<PB N="4" REF="30">
but determined by the maior part of the Councell in which the Precedent had 2 voices. Vntill the 13 of May they sought a place to plant in, then the Coun|cell was sworne, M. <HI>Wingfeild</HI> was chosen Precident, &amp; an oration made, whie Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> was not ad|mitted of the Councell as the rest.</P>
<P>Now falleth every man to worke, the Councell contriue the Fort, the rest cut downe trees to make place to pitch their Tents; some provide clapbord to relade the ships, some make gardens, some nets, &amp;c. The Salvages often visited vs kindly. The Precidents overweening iealousie would admit no exeroise at armes, or fortification, but the boughs of trees cast together in the forme of a halfe moone by the extra|ordinary paines and diligence of Captaine <HI>Kendall, Newport,</HI> with <HI>Smith,</HI> and 20 others, were sent to dis|cover <NOTE PLACE="marg">The discouery of the Falles and Powhatan.</NOTE> the head of the river: by divers smal habitations they passed, in 6 daies they arrived at a towne called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> consisting of some 12 houses pleasantly sea|te don a hill; before it 3 fertil Iles, about it many of their cornefields, the place is very pleasant, and strong by nature, of this place the Prince is called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and his people <HI>Powhatans,</HI> to this place the river is na|vigable, but higher within a mile, by reason of the Rockes and Iles, there is not passage for a smal boate, this they call the Falles, the people in al parts kindly intreated them, til being returned within 20 miles of <HI>Iames</HI> towne, they gaue iust cause of iealousie, but had God not blessed the discoverers otherwise then those at the fort, there had then beene an end of that planta|tion; for at the fort, where they arived the next day,
<PB N="5" REF="30">
they found 17 men hurt, and a boy slaine by the Sal|vages, and had it not chanced a crosse barre shot from <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort assal|ted by the Sal|vages.</NOTE> the ships strooke down a bough from a tree amongst them that caused them to retire, our men had all been slaine, being securely all at worke, and their armes in drie fats.</P>
<P>Herevpon the President was contented the Fort should be pallisadoed, the ordinance mounted, his me~ armed and exercised, for many were the assaults, and Ambuscadoes of the Salvages, and our men by their disorderly stragling were often hurt, when the Salva|ges by the nimblenesse of their heeles well escaped. What toile wee had, with so smal a power to guard our workme~ adaies, watch al night, resist our enimies and effect our businesse, to relade the ships, cut downe trees, and prepare the ground to plant our corne, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I referre to the readers consideration.

check, rather then by particulating his designes make him so odious to the world, as to touch his life, or vt|terly overthrowe his reputation; but he much scorned their charitie, and publikely defied the vttermost of their crueltie, hee wisely prevented their pollicies, though he could not suppresse their envies, yet so wel he demeaned himselfe in this busines, as all the com|pany did see his innocencie, &amp; his adversaries malice, and those suborned to accuse him, accused his accusers of subornation; many vntruthes were alleaged against him; but being so apparently disproved begat a gene|rall hatred in the harts of the company against such vniust commanders; many were the mischiefes that daily sprong from their ignorant (yet ambitious) spi|rits; but the good doctrine and exhortation of our preacher M^r <HI>Hunt</HI> reconciled them, and caused Cap|taine <HI>Smith</HI> to be admitted of the Councell; the next day all receaved the Communion, the day following the Salvages voluntarily desired peace, and Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> returned for England with newes; leaving in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cap.

<P>_BEing thus left to our fortunes, it fortuned that within tennedaies <NOTE PLACE="marg">The occasion of sicknesse.</NOTE> scarse ten amongst'vs coulde ei|ther goe, or well stand, such ex|treame weaknes and sicknes op|pressed vs. And thereat none need morvaile, if they consider the cause and reason, which was this; whilest the ships staied, our allowance was some|what bettered, by a daily proportion of bisket which the sailers would pilser to sell, giue or exchange with <NOTE PLACE="marg">The sailers abu|ses.</NOTE> vs, for mony, saxesras, surres, or loue. But when they departed, there remained neither taverne, beere-house nor place of relife but the common kettell. Had we beene as free from all sinnes as gluttony, and drunken|nes, we might haue bin canonized for Saints; But our President would never haue bin admitted, for ingros|sing to his privat, Otemeale, sacke, oile, aquavitae, beefe egs, or what not, but the kettel; that indeede he allow|ed equally to be distributed, and that was halfe a pinte of wheat and as much barly boyled with water for a man a day, and this having fryed some 26. weeks in the ships-hold, contained as many wormes as graines; so that we might truely call it rather so much bran then corne, our drinke was water, our lodgings castles in aire, with this lodging and diet, our extreame toile in bearing and planting pallisadoes, so strained and brui|sed
<PB N="10" REF="33">
vs, and our continuall labour in the extremity of the heate had so weakned vs, as were cause sufficient to haue made vs as miserable in our natiue cou~try, or any other place in the world. From May, to Septem|ber, those that escaped; lived vpon Sturgion, and sea-Crabs, 50. in this time we buried, The rest seeing the Preside~ts proiects to escape these miseries in our Pin|nas <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abad Precide~t.</NOTE> by flight (who all this time had neither felt want nor sicknes) so moved our dead spirits, as we deposed him; and established <HI>Ratcliffe</HI> in his place, <HI>(Gosnoll</HI> be|ing dead) <HI>Kendall</HI> deposed, <HI>Smith</HI> newly recovered, <HI>Martin</HI> and <HI>Ratliffe</HI> was by his care preserved and re|lieued, but now was all our provision spent, the Stur|geon gone, all helps abandoned each houre expecting the fury of the Salvages; when God the patron of all good indeavours in that desperate extreamity so cha~|ged the harts of the Salvages, that they brought such plenty of their fruits, and provision as no man wan|ted. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plentie vnex|pected.</NOTE></P>
<P>And now where some affirmed it was ill done of the Councel to send forth men so badly prouided, this incontradictable reason will shew them plainely they are too ill advised to nourish such il conceipts; first the fault of our going was our owne, what coulde bee thought fitting or necessary wee had, but what wee should finde, what we should want, where we shoulde be, we were all ignorant, and supposing to make our passage in two monthes, with victuall to liue, and the advantage of the spring to worke; we weare at sea 5. monthes where we both spent our victuall &amp; lost the opportunity of the time, and season to plant.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="33">
Such actions haue ever since the worlds beginning beene subiect to such accidents, and every thing of worth is found full of difficulties, but nothing so diffi|cult as to establish a common wealth so farre remote from men and meanes, and where mens mindes are so vntoward as neither do well themselues nor suffer o|thers; but to proceed.</P>
<P>The new President, and <HI>Martin,</HI> being little belo|ved; of weake iudgement in dangers, and lesse industry in peace, co~mitted the managing of all things abroad to captaine <HI>Smith:</HI> who by his owne example, good words, and faire promises, set some to mow, others to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The building of Iames Towne.</NOTE> binde thatch, some to build houses, others to thatch them, himselfe alwaies bearing the greatest taske for his own share, so that in short time, he provided most of them lodgings neglecting any for himselfe. this done, seeing the Salvages superfluity beginne to de|crease (with some of his workemen) shipped himselfe in the shallop to search the country for trade, the wa~t of the language, knowledge to ma~nage his boat with out sailers, the want of a sufficient power, (knowing the multitude of the Salvages) apparell for his men, &amp; other necessaries, were infinite impediments, yet no discourageme~t. Being but 6 or 7 in company he went down the river to <HI>Kecoughtan,</HI> where at first they scor|ned him, as a starved man, yet he so dealt with them, that the next day they loaded his boat with corne, &amp; in his returne he discouered &amp; kindly traded with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The beginning of trade abroad,</NOTE> <HI>Weraskoyks,</HI> in the meane time those at the fort so glut|ted the Salvages with their commodities as they be|came not regarded.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="34">
<HI>Smith</HI> perceiving (notwithstanding their late mise|rie) not any regarded but from hand to mouth, (the company being well recovered) caused the Pinas to bee provided with things fitting to get provision for the yeare following; but in the interim he made 3. or 4. iournies and discovered the people of <HI>Chickahamine</HI> yet what he carefully provided the rest carelesly spent. <HI>Wingfield</HI> and <HI>Kendall</HI> liuing in disgrace, seeing althings at randome in the absence of <HI>Smith,</HI> The companies dislike of their Presidents weaknes, &amp; their small loue <NOTE PLACE="marg">The discoverie of Chickahami|ne.</NOTE> to <HI>Martins</HI> never-mending sicknes, strengthened the~|selues with the sailers, and other confederates to re|gaine their former credit &amp; authority, or at least such meanes abord the Pinas, (being fitted to saile as <HI>Smith</HI> had appointed for trade) to alter her course and to go for England. <HI>Smith</HI> vnexpectedly returning had the plot discovered to him, much trouble he had to pre|vent it till with store of fauken and musket shot he for+ced them stay or sinke in the riuers, which action cost the life of captaine <HI>Kendall.</HI> These brawles are so dis|gustfull, as some will say they were better forgotten, yet all men of good iudgement will conclude, it were better their basenes should be manifest to the world, then the busines beare the scorne and shame of their excused disorders. The President and captaine Archer not long after intended also to haue abandoned the country, which proiect also was curbed, and suppres|sed by <HI>Smith.</HI> The Spanyard never more greedily desi|red <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another proiect to abandon the Country.</NOTE> gold then he victuall, which finding so plentiful in the riuer of <HI>Chickahamine</HI> where hundreds of Salvages in diuers places stood with baskets expecting his co~|ming.

And now the winter approaching, the rivers be came so covered with swans, geese, duckes, &amp; cranes, that we daily feasted with good bread, Virginia pease, pumpions, and putchamins, fish, sowle, and diverse sorts of wild beasts as fat as we could eat them: so that none of our Tustaffaty humorists desired to goe for Engla~d. But our comaedies never endured lo~g without a Tragedie; so~e idle exceptio~s being muttered against Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> for not discovering the head of <HI>Chic|kahamine</HI> river, and taxed by the Councell, to bee too slowe in so worthie an attempt. The next voyage hee proceeded so farre that with much labour by cutting of trees in sunder he made his passage, but when his Barge could passe no farther, he left her in a broad bay out of danger of shot, commanding none should goe ashore till his returne, himselfe with 2 English &amp; two Salvages went vp higher in a Canowe, but hee was not long absent, but his me~ went ashore, whose want of government, gaue both occasion and opportunity to the Salvages to surprise one <HI>George Casson,</HI> &amp; much failed not to haue cut of the boat &amp; all the rest, <HI>Smith</HI> little dreaming of that accident, being got to the mar shes at the rivers head, 20 myles in the desert, had his 2 men slaine (as is supposed) sleeping by the Canowe, whilst himselfe by fowling sought them victuall, who finding he was beset with 200 Salvages, 2 of them hee slew, stil defending himselfe with the aid of a Salvage his guid, (whome hee bound to his arme and vsed as his buckler, till at last slipping into a bogmire they tooke him prisoner: when this newes came to the fort much was their sorrow for his losse, fewe expecting
<PB N="14" REF="35">
what ensued. A month those Barbarians kept him pri|soner, many strange triumphes and coniurations they made of him, yet hee so demeaned himselfe amongst them, as he not only diverted them from surprising the Fort, but procured his owne liberty, and got himselfe and his company such estimation amongst them, that those Salvages admired him as a demi God. So re|turning safe to the Fort, once more staied the Pinnas her flight for England, which till his returne, could not set saile, so extreame was the weather, and so great the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The 3 proiect to abando the fort</NOTE> frost.</P>
<P>His relation of the plentie he had seene, especially at <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> where inhabited <HI>Powhatan</HI> (that till that time was vnknowne) so revived againe their dead spirits as all mens feare was abandoned, <HI>Powhatan</HI> ha|ving sent with this Captaine divers of his men loaded with provision, he had co~ditioned, &amp; so appointed his trustie messengers to bring but 2 or 3 of our great or|denances, but the messengers being satisfied with the sight of one of the~ discharged, ran away amazed with feare, till meanes was vsed with guifts to assure them our loues. Thus you may see what difficulties stil cros|sed any good indeavour, and the good successe of the businesse, and being thus oft brought to the very peri|od of destruction, yet you see by what strange meanes God hath still delivered it. As for the insufficiencie of them admitted in commission, that errour could not be prevented by their electors, there being no other choice, and all were strangers each to others educati|on, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A true proofe of Gods loue to the action.</NOTE> quallities, or disposition; &amp; if any deeme it a shame to our nation, to haue any mention made of these e|normities,

<P><PB N="16" REF="36">
_ALL this time our cares were not so much to abandon the Coun|trie, but the Treasurer &amp; Coun|cell in England were as diligent and carefull to supplie vs. Two tall ships they sent vs, with neere 100 men, well furnished with all things could be imagined neces|sarie, both for them and vs. The one commanded by Captaine <HI>Newport:</HI> the other by Captaine <HI>Nelson,</HI> an honest man and an expert marriner, but such was the leewardnesse of his ship, (that though he were within sight of <HI>Cape Henry)</HI> by stormy contrarie windes, was <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Phenix fro~ Cape henry for|ced to the west Indies.</NOTE> forced so farre to sea, as the West Indies was the next land for the repaire of his Masts, and reliefe of wood and water. But Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> got in, and arived at <HI>Iames</HI> towne, not long after the redemption of Cap|taine <HI>Smith,</HI> to whome the Salvages every other day brought such plentie of bread, fish, turkies, squirrels, deare, &amp; other wild beasts, part they gaue him as pre|sents from the king; the rest, hee as their market clarke set the price how they should sell.</P>
<P>So he had incha~ted those poore soules (being their prisoner) in demonstrating vnto them the roundnesse of the world, the course of the moone and starres, the cause of the day and night the largenes of the seas the quallities of our ships, shot and powder, The devision of the world, with the diversity of people, their com|plexions, customes and conditions. All which hee fai|ned <NOTE PLACE="marg">How C. Smith got his liberty.</NOTE> to be vnder the command of Captaine <HI>Newport,</HI> whom he tearmed to them his father; of whose arri|val,
<PB N="17" REF="36">
it chanced he so directly prophecied, as they estee|med him an oracle; by these fictions he not only saved his owne life, and obtained his liberty, but had them at that command, he might command them what he li|sted. That God that created al these things; they knew <NOTE PLACE="marg">Their opinion of our God.</NOTE> he adored for his God, whom they would also tearme in their discourses, the God of captaine <HI>Smith.</HI> The President and Councel so much envied his estimation amongst the Salvages (though wee all in generall e|qually participated with him of the good therof) that they wrought it into their vnderstandings, by their great bounty in giuing 4. times more for their com|modities then he appointed; that their greatnesse and authority, as much exceed his, as their bounty, and li|berality; Now the arrivall of his first supply, so over|ioyed vs, that we could not devise too much to please the mariners. We gaue them liberty to track or trade at their pleasures. But in a short time, it followed, that could not be had for a pound of copper, which before was sold for an ounce, Thus ambition, and sufferance, cut the throat of our trade, but confirmed their opini|on of <HI>Newports</HI> greatnes, (wherewith <HI>Smith</HI> had pos|sessed <HI>Powhatan)</HI> especially by the great presents <HI>New|port</HI> (often sent him, before he could prepare the Pinas to go and visit him; so that this Salvage also desired to see him.

Salvages suspition) glaunced in the eies of <HI>Powhatan</HI> many Trifles who fixed his humour vpon a few blew beads; A long time he importunatly desired them, but <HI>Smith</HI> seemed so much the more to affect the~, so that ere we departed, for a pound or two of blew beads he brought over my king for 2 or 300 bushels of corne, yet parted good friends. The like entertainement we fou~d of <HI>Spechanchynough</HI> king of <HI>Pamaunke</HI> whom al|so he in like manner fitted, (at the like rates) with blew beads: and so we returned to the fort. Where this new supply being lodged with the rest, accidently fired the quarters, &amp; so the Towne, which being but thatched with reeds the fire was so fierce as it burnt their palli|zadoes (though 10. or 12 yardes distant) with their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames towne burnt.</NOTE> armes, bedding, apparell, and much private provision. Good <HI>M^r Hunt</HI> our preacher lost all his library, and al that he had (but the cloathes on his backe,) yet none ever see him repine at his losse. This hapned in the winter, in that extreame frost, 1607. Now though we had victuall sufficient, I meane only of Oatemeale, meale, and corne, yet the ship staying there 14. weeks when shee might as well haue been gone in 14. daies, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A ship idly loi|tring 14 weeks.</NOTE> spent the beefe, porke, oile, aquavitae, fish, butter, and cheese, beere and such like; as was provided to be lan|ded vs. When they departed, what their discretion could spare vs, to make a feast or two with bisket, pork beefe, fish, and oile, to relish our mouths, of each som|what they left vs, yet I must confest those that had ei|ther mony, spare clothes, credit to giue bils of pay|ment, gold rings, furres, or any such commodities were ever welcome to this removing taverne, such

was our patience to obay such vile commanders, and buy our owne provision at 15 times the valew, suffe|ring the~ feast (we bearing the charge) yet must not re|pine, but fast, and then leakage, ship-rats, and other ca|sualties occasioned the losse, but the vessell and rem|nants (for totals) we were glad to receiue with all our hearts to make vp the account, highly commending their providence for preserving that. For all this plen|tie our ordinarie was but meale and water, so that this great charge little relieved our wants, whereby with the extreamity of the bitter cold aire more then halfe of vs died, and tooke our deathes, in that piercing win+ter I cannot deny, but both <HI>Skrivener</HI> and <HI>Smith</HI> did their best to amend what was amisse, but with the Pre|sidents went the maior part, that their hornes were too short. But the worst mischiefe was, our gilded re|finers with their golden promises, made all men their slaues in hope of recompence, there was no talke, no <NOTE PLACE="marg">The effect of meere verba|lists.</NOTE> hope, no worke, but dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold, such a brute of gold, as one mad fellow de|sired to bee buried in the sandes, least they should by their art make gold of his bones, little need there was and lesse reason, the ship should stay, their wages run <NOTE PLACE="marg">a needles charge</NOTE> on, our victuall consume, 14 weekes, that the Marri|ners might say, they built such a golden Church, that we can say, the raine washed neare to nothing in 14 daies.

<P>The arivall of the Phoenix, her returne, and other accidents.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THE authoritie nowe consisting in resi|ning, Captaine <HI>Martin</HI> and the still sick|ly President, the sale of the stores com|modities maintained their estates as in|heritable revenews. The spring appro|ching, and the ship departed, M. <HI>Skriuener</HI> and Capt. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The repairing of Iames towne</NOTE> <HI>Smith</HI> divided betwixt the~, the rebuilding our towne, the repairing our pallisadoes, the cutting downe trees, preparing our fields, planting our corne, &amp; to rebuild our Church, and recover our store-house; al men thus busie at their severall labours, M. <HI>Nelson</HI> arived with his lost Phoenix (lost I say, for that al men deemed him lost) landing safely his men; so well hee had mannaged his ill hap, causing the Indian Iles to feed his company

that his victuall (to that was left vs before) was suffici|ent for halfe a yeare, he had nothing but he freely im|parted it, which honest dealing (being a marriner) cau|sed vs admire him, wee would not haue wished so much as he did for vs. Nowe to relade this ship with some good tidings. The President (yet notwithstan|ding with his dignitie to leaue the sort) gaue order to Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> and M. <HI>Skriuener</HI> to discover &amp; search the commodities of <HI>Monacans</HI> countrie beyound the Falles, 60 able men was allotted their number, the <NOTE PLACE="marg">60 appointed to discover Mona|can.</NOTE> which within 6 daies exercise, <HI>Smith</HI> had so well trai|ned to their armes and orders, that they little feared with whome they should encounter. Yet so vnseaso|nable was the time, and so opposite was Capt. <HI>Martin</HI> to every thing, but only to fraught his ship also with his phantasticall gold, as Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> rather desi|red to relade her with Cedar, which was a present di|spatch; then either with durt, or the reports of an vn|certaine discoverie.

The pati|ent councel, that nothing would moue to warre with the Salvages, would gladly haue wrangled with cap|taine <HI>Smith</HI> for his cruelty, yet none was slaine to any mans knowledge but it brought them in such feare &amp;

<P>These being in an open barge of two tunnes bur|then leaving the Phenix at Cape-Henry we crossed the bay to the Easterne shore &amp; fell with the Iles cal|led <HI>Smiths,</HI> Iles the first people we saw were 2. grimme and stout Salvages vpon Cape-Charles with long <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Charles.</NOTE> poles like Iavelings, headed with bone, they boldly de|manded what we were, and what we would, but after many circumstances, they in time seemed very kinde, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Acawmacke.</NOTE> and directed vs to <HI>Acawmacke</HI> the habitation of the <HI>We rowans</HI> where we were kindly intreated; this king was the comliest proper civill Salvage wee incountred: his country is a pleasant fertill clay-soile.

This as a miracle drew many to behold them, all which, (being a great part of his people) not long after died, and not any one escaped. They spake the language of <HI>Powhata~</HI> wherein they made such descriptions of the bay, Iles, and rivers that often did vs exceeding pleasure. Passing
<PB N="30" REF="43">
along the coast, searching every inlet, and bay fit for harbours &amp; habitations seeing many Iles in the midst of the bay, we bore vp for them, but ere wee could at|taine them such an extreame gust of wind, raine, thu~|der, and lightning happened, that with great daunger we escaped the vnmercifull raging of that ocean-like <NOTE PLACE="marg">An extreame gust.</NOTE> water. The next day searching those inhabitable Iles (which we called Russels Iles) to provide fresh water, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Russels Iles.</NOTE> the defect whereof forced vs to follow the next Eas|terne channell, which brought vs to the river <HI>Wighco|comoco,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wighcocomoco.</NOTE> the people at first with great furie, seemed to assault vs, yet at last with songs, daunces, and much mirth, became very tractable, but searching their habi|tations for water, wee could fill but 3, and that such <NOTE PLACE="marg">An extreame want of fresh water.</NOTE> puddle that never til then, wee ever knew the want of good water, we digged and searched many places but ere the end of two daies wee would haue refused two barricoes of gold for one of that puddle water of <HI>Wighcocomoco.</HI> Being past these Iles, falling with a high land vpon the maine wee found a great pond of fresh water, but so exceeding hot, that we supposed it some bath: that place we called Point ployer, being thus re|freshed in crossing over from the maine to other Iles, the wind and waters so much increased with thunder, lightning, and raine, that our fore-mast blew overbord and such mightie waues overwrought vs in that smal <NOTE PLACE="marg">The barge neere sunk in a gust.</NOTE> barge, that with great labour wee kept her from sin|king by freeing out the water, 2 daies we were infor|ced to inhabit these vninhabited Iles, which (for the extremitie of gusts, thunder, raine, stormes, and il wea|ther) we called <HI>Limbo.</HI> Repairing our fore saile with

The first inlet we found, wee called <HI>Bolus,</HI> for that the clay (in many places) was like (if not) Bole-Armoniacke: when we first set saile, some of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bolus river.</NOTE> our gallants doubted nothing, but that our Captaine would make too much hast home; but hauing lien not aboue 12 daies in this smal Barge, oft tired at their oares, their bread spoiled with wet, so much that it was rotten (yet so good were their stomacks that they could digest it) did with continuall complaints so im|portune him now to returne, as caused him bespeake them in this manner. Gentlemen if you would reme~|ber the memorable historie of Sir <HI>Ralfe Lane,</HI> how his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Smiths speech to his souldiers.</NOTE> company importuned him to proceed in the discove|rie of <HI>Morattico,</HI> alleaging, they had yet a dog, that be|ing boyled with Saxafras leaues, would richly feed the~ in their returnes; what a shame would it be for you

(that haue beene so suspitious of my tendernesse) to force me returne with a months provision scarce able to say where we haue bin, nor yet heard of that wee were sent to seeke; you cannot say but I haue shared with you of the worst is past; and for what is to come of lodging, diet, or whatsoever, I am contented you allot the worst part to my selfe; as for your feares, that I will lose my selfe in these vnknowne large waters, or be swallowed vp in some stormie gust, abandon those childish feares, for worse then is past cannot happen, and there is as much danger to returne, as to proceed forward. Regaine therefore your old spirits; for return I wil not, (if God assist me) til I haue seene the <HI>Massa|womekes,</HI> found <HI>Patawomeck,</HI> or the head of this great water you conceit to be endlesse. 3 or 4 daies wee ex|pected wind and weather, whose adverse extreamities added such discouragements to our discontents as 3 or 4 fel extreame sicke, whose pittiful complaints cau|sed vs to returne, leauing the bay some 10 miles broad at 9 or 10 fadome water.</P>

their furie, our Captaine prepared with a seeming willingnesse (as they) to encounter them, the grazing of the bullets vpon the river, with the ecco of the woods so amazed them, as down went their bowes &amp; arrowes; (and exchanging hostage) <HI>Iames Watkins</HI> was sent 6 myles vp the woods to their kings habita|tion: wee were kindly vsed by these Salvages, of whome wee vnderstood, they were commaunded to betray vs, by <HI>Powhatans</HI> direction, and hee so di|rected <NOTE PLACE="marg">A treacherous proiect.</NOTE> from the discontents of Iames towne. The like incounters we found at <HI>Patawomeck Cecocawone</HI> &amp; divers other places, but at <HI>Moyaones Nacothtant</HI> and <HI>Taux,</HI> the people did their best to content vs. The cause of this discovery, was to search a glistering met|tal, the Salvages told vs they had from <HI>Patawomeck,</HI> (the which <HI>Newport</HI> assured that he had tryed to hold halfe siluer) also to search what furres, metals, riuers, Rockes, nations, woods, fishings, fruits, victuals and o|ther commodities the land afforded, and whether the bay were endlesse, or how farre it extended. The mine we found 9 or 10 myles vp in the cou~try from the ri|ver, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Antimony.</NOTE> but it proved of no value: Some Otters, Beavers, Martins, Luswarts, and sables we found, and in diverse places that abunda~ce of fish lying so thicke with their heads aboue the water, as for want of nets (our barge driving amongst them) we attempted to catch them with a frying pan, but we found it a bad instrument to catch fish with.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Presidencie surrendred to Captaine Smith, the arrivall and returne of the second sup|ply: and what happened.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe 10. of September 1608. by the ele|ction of the Councel, &amp; request of the company Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> received the letters patents, and tooke vpon him the place of President, which till then by no meanes he would accept though hee were often im|portuned therevnto. Now the building of <HI>Ratcliffes</HI> pallas staide as a thing needlesse; The church was re|paired, the storehouse recouered; building prepared for the supply we expected. The fort reduced to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">QVERE, <GAP DESC="symbol" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> forme of this figure, the order of watch renued, the squadrons (each setting of the watch) trained. The
<PB N="42" REF="49">
whole company every Satturday exercised in a fielde prepared for that purpose; the boates trimmed for trade which in their Iourney encountred the second supply, that brought them back to discover the coun|try of <HI>Monacan,</HI> how, or why, Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> ob|tained such a private commission as not to returne without a lumpe of gold, a certainty of the south-sea or one of the lost company of <HI>S^r Walter Rawley</HI> I know not, nor why he brought such a 5. pieced barge, not to beare vs to that south sea, till we had borne her over the mountaines: which how farre they extend is yet vnknowne) as for the coronation of <HI>Powhatan</HI> &amp; his presents of Bason, Ewer, Bed, Clothes, and such costly nouelties, they had bin much better well spared, then so ill spent. For we had his favour much better, onlie for a poore peece of Copper, till this stately kinde of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powbatans scorne when his curtefie was most deserved</NOTE> soliciting made him so much overvalue himselfe, that he respected vs as much as nothing at all; as for the hi|ring of the Poles and Dutch to make pitch and tarre, glasse, milles, and sope-ashes, was most necessarie and well. But to send them and seauenty more without vi|ctuall to worke, was not so well considered; yet this could not haue hurt vs, had they bin 200. (though the~ we were 130 that wanted for our selues.) For we had the Salvages in that Decorum, (their haruest beeing newly gathered) that we feared not to get victuall suf|ficient had we bin 500. Now vvas there no way to <NOTE PLACE="marg">No way but one to overthrowe the busines.</NOTE> make vs miserable but to neglect that time to make our provision, whilst it was to be had; the which vvas done to perfourme this strange discovery, but more strange coronation; to loose that time, spend that vi|ctuall
<PB N="43" REF="49">
we had, tire &amp; starue our men, having no means to carry victuall, munition, the hurr or sicke, but their owne backs, how or by whom they vvere invented I knovv not; But Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> we only accounted the author, vvho to effect these proiects had so gilded all our hopes, vvith great promises, that both compa|ny and Councel concluded his resolution. I confesse we little vnderstood then our estates, to conclude his conclusion, against al the inconveniences the foresee|ing President all eadged. There was added to the cou~|cell one Captaine <HI>Waldo,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Winne</HI> two an|cient souldiers and valiant gentlemen, but ignorant of the busines (being newly arrived) <HI>Rateliffe</HI> vvas also permitted to haue his voice, &amp; <HI>M^r Scrivener</HI> desirous to see strange countries, so that although <HI>Smith</HI> was President, yet the Councell had the authoritie, and ru|led it as they listed; as for cleering <HI>Smiths</HI> obiections, how pitch, and tarre, wanscot, clapbord, glasse, &amp; sope ashes, could be provided to relade the ship; or provisi|ongot to liue withal, when none was in the Country and that which we had, spent before the ships depar|ted; The answer was, Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> vndertook to fraught the Pinnace with corne, in going and retur|ning in his discoverie, and to refraught her againe fro~ <HI>Werawocomoco;</HI> also promising a great proportion of victuall from his ship, inferring that <HI>Smiths</HI> proposi|tions were only devises to hinder his iourney, to ef|fect it himselfe; and that the crucltie <HI>Smith</HI> had vsed to the Salvages, in his absence, might occasion them to hinder his designes; For which, al workes were left; and 120 chosen men were appointed for his guard,
<PB N="44" REF="50">
and <HI>Smith,</HI> to make cleere these seeming suspicions, that the Salvages were not so desperat, as was preten|ded by Captaine <HI>Newport,</HI> and how willing he was to further them to effect their proiects, (because the co|ronation <NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine Smith with 4 goeth to Powbatan.</NOTE> would consume much time) vndertooke their message to <HI>Powhatan;</HI> to intreat him to come to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne to receiue his presents, accompanied only with Captaine <HI>Waldo, M. Andrew Buckler, Edward Brinton, &amp; Samuell Collier;</HI> with these 4 hee went over land, against <HI>Werawacomoco,</HI> there passed the river of <HI>Pa|mavuke</HI> in the Salvages Canowes, <HI>Powhatan</HI> being 30 myles of, who, presently was sent for, in the meane time his women entertained <HI>Smith</HI> in this manner.</P>
<P>In a faire plaine field they made a fire, before which <NOTE PLACE="marg">The womens en|tertainement at Werawcomoco</NOTE> he sitting vppon a mat; suddainly amongst the woods was heard such a hideous noise and shriking, that they betooke them to their armes, supposing <HI>Powhatan</HI> with all his power came to surprise them; but the be|holders which were many, men, women, &amp; children, satisfied the Captaine there was no such matter, be|ing presently presented with this anticke, 30 young women camenaked out of the woods (only covered behind and before with a few greene leaues) their bo|dies al painted, some white, some red, some black, some partie colour, but every one different, their leader had a faire paire of stagges hornes on her head, and an ot|ter skinne at her girdle, another at her arme, a quiver of arrowes at her backe, and bow and arrowes in her hand, the next in her ha~d a sword, another a club, ano|ther a pot-stick, all hornd alike, the rest every one with their severall devises. These feindes with most hellish
<PB N="45" REF="50">
cries, and shouts rushing from amongst the trees, cast themselues in a ring about the fire, singing, and daun|cing with excellent ill varietie, oft falling into their in|fernall passions, and then solemnely againe to sing, and daunce. Having spent neere an houre, in this maskara|do, as they entered; in like manner departed; hauing re+accommodated themselues, they solemnely invited <HI>Smith</HI> to their lodging, but no sooner was hee within the house, but all these Nimphes more tormented him then ever, with crowding, and pressing, and hanging vpon him, most tediously crying, loue you not mee. This salutation ended, the feast was set, consisting of fruit in baskets, fish, &amp; flesh in wooden platters, beans and pease there wanted not (for 20 hogges) nor any Salvage daintie their invention could devise; some at|tending, others singing and dancing about them; this mirth and banquet being ended, with firebrands (in|stead of torches) they conducted him to his lodging.</P>
<P>The next day, came <HI>Powhatan; Smith</HI> delivered his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Captain Smiths message.</NOTE> message of the presents sent him, and redelivered him <HI>Namontack,</HI> desiring him come to his Father <HI>New|port</HI> to accept those presents, and conclude their re|venge against the <HI>Monacans,</HI> wherevnto the subtile Salvage thus replied.</P>
<P>If your king haue sent me presents, I also am a king, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatans an|swer.</NOTE> and this my land, 8 daies I will stay to receaue them, your father is to come to me, not I to him, nor yet to your fort, neither will I bite at such a baite: as for the <HI>Monacans,</HI> I can revenge my owne iniuries, and as for <HI>Atquanuchuck,</HI> where you say your brother was slain, it is a contrary way from those parts you suppose it.

But for any salt water beyond the mountaines, the re+lations you haue had from my people are false, wher|vpon he began to draw plots vpon the ground (accor|ding to his discourse) of all those regions; many other discourses they had (yet both desirous to giue each o|ther content in Complementall courtesies) and so Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> returned with this answer.</P>
<P>Vpon this Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> sent his presents by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatans Co|ronation.</NOTE> water, which is neare 100 miles, with 50 of the best shot, himselfe went by land which is but 12 miles, where he met with our 3 barges to transport him o|ver. All things being fit for the day of his coronation, the presents were brought, his bason, ewer, bed &amp; fur|niture set vp, his scarlet cloake and apparel (with much adoe) put on him (being perswaded by <HI>Namontacke</HI> they would doe him no hurt.) But a fowle trouble there was to make him kneele to receaue his crowne, he neither knowing the maiestie, nor meaning of a Crowne, nor bending of the knee, indured so many perswasions, examples, and instructions, as tired them all. At last by leaning hard on his shoulders, he a little stooped, and <HI>Newport</HI> put the Crowne on his head. When by the warning of a pistoll, the boates were prepared with such a volly of shot, that the king start vp in a horrible feare, till he see all was well, then re|membring himselfe, to congratulate their kindnesse, he gaue his old shoes and his mantle to Captain <HI>New|port.</HI> But perceiuing his purpose was to discover the <HI>Monacans,</HI> hee laboured to divert his resolution refu|sing to lend him either men, or guids, more then <HI>Na|montack,</HI> and so (after some complementall kindnesse
<PB N="47" REF="51">
on both sides) in requitall of his presents, he presented <HI>Newport</HI> with a heape of wheat eares, that might co~|tain some 7 or 8 bushels, &amp; as much more we bought ready dressed in the towne, wherewith we returned to the fort.</P>
<P>The ship having disburdened her selfe of 70 per+sons, with the first gentlewoman, and woman servant <NOTE PLACE="marg">The discovery of Monacan.</NOTE> that arrived in our Colony; Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> with al the Councell, and 120 chosen men, set forward for the discovery of <HI>Monacan,</HI> leauing the President at the fort with 80. (such as they were) to relade the shippe. Arriving at the falles, we marched by land some forty myles in 2 daies and a halfe, and so returned downe to the same path we went. Two townes wee discovered of the <HI>Monacans,</HI> the people neither vsing vs well nor ill, yet for our securitie wee tooke one of their pettie <HI>Werowances,</HI> and lead him bound, to conduct vs the way. And in our returne searched many places wee supposed mynes, about which we spent some time in refining, having one <HI>William Callicut</HI> a refiner, fitted for that purpose, from that crust of earth wee digged hee perswaded vs to beleeue he extracted some smal quan titie of silver (and not vnlikely better stuffe might bee had for the digging) with this poore trial being con|tented to leaue this faire, fertill, well watred countrie. Co~ming to the Falles, the Salvages fained there were diverse ships come into the Bay to kill them at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne. Trade they would not, and find their corn we could not, for they had hid it in the woods, and being thus deluded we arrived at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, halfe sicke, all complaining, and tired with toile, famine, and dis|co~tent,
<PB N="48" REF="52">
to haue only but discovered our gilded hopes, and such fruitlesse certaineties, as the President fore|told vs.</P>
<P>No sooner were we landed, but the President dis|persed many as were able, some for glasse, others for pitch, tarre and sope ashes, leaving them, (with the fort) to the Councels oversight. But 30 of vs he co~du|cted 5. myles from the fort to learn to make clapbord, cut downe trees, and ly in woods; amongst the rest he had chosen <HI>Gabriell Beadell,</HI> &amp; <HI>Iohn Russell</HI> the only two gallants of this last supply, and both proper gentle|men: strange were these pleasures to their conditions, yet lodging eating, drinking, working, or playing they doing but as the President, all these things were carri|ed so pleasantly, as within a weeke they became Ma|sters, making it their delight to heare the trees thun|der as they fell, but the axes so oft blistered there ten|der fingers, that commonly every third blow had a lowd oath to drowne the eccho; for remedy of which sin the President devised howe to haue everie mans oathes numbred, and at night, for every oath to haue a can of water povvred downe his sleeue, vvith <NOTE PLACE="marg">A punishment for swearing.</NOTE> vvhich every offender vvas so vvashed (himselfe &amp; all) that a man should scarse heare an oath in a weeke.</P>
<P>By this, let no ma~ think that the President, or these gentlemen spent their times as common wood-hac|kers at felling of trees, or, such like other labours, or that they were pressed to any thing as hirelings or co~|mon slaues, for what they did (being but once a little inured) it seemed, and they conceited it only as a plea+sure and a recreation. Yet 30 or 40 of such voluntary
<PB N="49" REF="52">
Gentlemen would doe more in a day then 100 of <NOTE PLACE="marg">One gentleman better then 20 lubbers.</NOTE> the rest that must bee prest to it by compulsion. Master <HI>Scrivener,</HI> Captaine <HI>Waldo,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Winne</HI> at the fort, every one in like manner care|fully regarded their charge. The President retur|ning from amongst the woodes, seeing the time con|sumed, and no provision gotten, (and the ship lay Idle, and would do nothing) presently imbarked himselfe in the discovery barge, giving order to the Cou~cell, to send <HI>M^r Persey</HI> after him with the next barge that ar|rived at the fort; 2. barges, he had himselfe, and 20. me~, but arriving at <HI>Chickahamina</HI> that dogged nation, was too wel acquainted with our wants, refusing to trade, with as much scorne and insolencie as they could ex|presse. The President perceiving it was <HI>Powhatans</HI> pol|licy to starue vs, told them he came not so much for <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Chickaha|mines forced to contribution,</NOTE> their corne, as to revenge his imprisonment, and the death of his men murdered by them, &amp; so landing his men, and ready to charge them, they immediatly fled; but then they sent their imbassadours, with corne, fish, fowl, or what they had to make their peace, (their corne being that year bad) they complained extream|ly of their owne wants, yet fraughted our boats with 100 bushels of corne, and in like manner <HI>M^r Persies,</HI> that not long after vs arriued; they having done the best they could to content vs, within 4. or 5. daies we returned to Iames Towne.</P>
<P>Though this much contented the company (that then feared nothing but starving) yet some so envied his good successe, that they rather desired to starue, the~ <NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad reward for well doing.</NOTE> his paines should proue so muchmore effectuall then

theirs; some proiects there was, not only to haue de|posed him but to haue kept him out of the fort, for that being President, he would leaue his place, and the fort without their consents; but their hornes were so much too short to effect it, as they themselues more narrowly escaped a greater mischiefe.</P>
<P>All this time our old taverne, made as much of all <NOTE PLACE="marg">A good tauerne in Virginia.</NOTE> them that had either mony or ware as could bee desi|red; and by this time they were become so perfect on all sides (I meane Souldiers, Sailers, and Salvages,) as there was ten-times more care, to maintaine their da~|nable and private trade, then to provide for the Colo|ny things that were necessary, neither was it a small pollicy in the mariners, to report in England wee had such plenty and bring vs so many men without victu|all, when they had so many private factors in the fort, that within 6. or 7. weekes after the ships returne, of 2. or 300. hatchets, chissels, mattocks, and pickaxes searce 20. could be found, and for pike-heads, kniues, shot, powder, or any thing (they could steale fro~ their <NOTE PLACE="marg">A bad trade of masters and sai|lers.</NOTE> fellowes) was vendible; They knew as well (and as se|cretly) how to convay them to trade with the Salva|ges, for furres, baskets, mussaneekes, young beastes or such like commodities, as exchange them with the sai|lers, for butter, cheese, biefe, porke, aquavitae, beere, bis|ket, and oatmeale; and then faine, all was sent the~ fro~ their friends. And though Virginia afford no furs for the store, yet one mariner in one voyage hath got so many, as hee hath confessed to haue solde in England for 30^l.</P>
<P>Those are the Saint-seeming worthies of <HI>Virginia,</HI>

that haue notwithstanding all this, meate, drinke, and pay, but now they begin to grow weary, their trade being both perceived and prevented; none hath bin in <HI>Virginia</HI> (that hath observed any thing) which knowes not this to be true, and yet the scorne, and shame was the poore souldiers, gentlemen and carelesse gover|nours, who were all thus bought and solde, the ad|venturers cousened, and the action overthrowne by their false excuses, informations, and directions, by this let all the world Iudge, how this businesse coulde prosper, being thus abused by such pilfering occasi|ons.</P>

lodged the first night at <HI>Weraskoyack;</HI> where the Presi|dent tooke sufficient provision; This kind Salvage did his best to divert him from seeing <HI>Powhatan,</HI> but per|ceiuing he could not prevaile, he advised in this maner <NOTE PLACE="marg">The good coun|sell of Weras|koyack.</NOTE> Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> you shall finde <HI>Powhatan</HI> to vse you kindly, but trust him not, and bee sure hee haue no op|portunitie to seaze on your armes, for hee hath sent for you only to cut your throats; the Captaine than+ked him for his good counsell, yet the better to try his loue, desired guides to <HI>Chowanoke,</HI> for he would send a present to that king to bind him his friend. To per|forme this iourney, was sent <HI>Michael Sicklemore,</HI> a ve|ry honest, valiant, and painefull souldier, with him two guids, and directions howe to search for the lost com|pany of S^r <HI>Walter Rawley,</HI> and silke grasse: then wee de|parted thence, the President assuring the king his per|petuall loue, and le~ft with him <HI>Samuell Collier</HI> his page to learne the language.</P>

proud Salvages; to quarter-in their houses, and guard our barge, and cause them giue vs what wee wanted, yet were we but 12 with the President, and yet we ne|ver wanted harbour where we found any houses. The 12 of Ianuarie we arrived at <HI>Werawocomoco,</HI> where the river was frozen neare halfe a mile from the shore; but to neglect no time, the President with his barge, so farre had approached by breaking the Ice as the eb left him amongst those oozie shoules, yet rather then to lie there frozen to death, by his owne example hee taught the~ to march middle deepe, more then a flight shot through this muddie froze~ ooze; when the barge <NOTE PLACE="marg">An ill march.</NOTE> sloted the appointed 2 or 3 to returne her abord the Pinnace, where for want of water in melting the salt Ice they made fresh water, but in this march M. <HI>Russell</HI> (whome none could perswade to stay behind) being somewhat ill, and exceeding heavie, so overtoiled him selfe, as the rest had much adoe (ere he got a shore) to regaine life, into his dead benummed spirits, quarte|ring in the next houses we found, we sent to <HI>Powhatan</HI> for provision, who sent vs plentie of bread, Turkies, &amp; Venison. The next day hauing feasted vs after his or|dinarie manner, he began to aske, when we would bee+gon, faining hee sent not for vs, neither had hee any corne, and his people much lesse, yet for 40 swords he would procure vs 40 bushels. The President shewing him the men there present, that brought him the message and conditions, asked him how it chaunced he became so forgetful thereat the king concluded the matter with a merry laughter, asking for our commo|dities, but none he liked without gunnes and swords, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatans sub|teltic.</NOTE>

<P>Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> seeing the intent of this subtil Sal|vage; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Capt. Smithes discourse to Powhatan.</NOTE> began to deale with him after this manner, <HI>Pow|hatan,</HI> though I had many courses to haue made my provision, yet beleeving your promises to supply my wants, I neglected all, to satisfie your desire, and to te|stifie my loue, I sent you my men for your building, neglecting my owne: what your people had you haue engrossed, forbidding them our trade, and nowe you thinke by consuming the time, wee shall consume for want, not hauing to fulfill your strange demandes, as for swords, and gunnes, I told you long agoe, I had none to spare And you shall knowe, those I haue, can keepe me from want, yet steale, or wrong you I will not, nor dissolue that friendship, wee haue mutually promised, (except you constraine mee by your bad vsage.</P>
<P>The king hauing atte~tiuely listned to this discourse; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatans re|ply &amp; flattery.</NOTE> promised, that both hee and his Country would spare him what they could, the which within 2 daies, they should receaue, yet. Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> (saith the king) some doubt I haue of your co~ming hither, that makes me not so kindly seeke to relieue you as I would; for many do informe me, your comming is not for trade, but to invademy people and possesse my Country, who dare not come to bring you corne, seeing you thus armed with your men. To cleere vs of this feare, leaue abord your weapons, for here they are needlesse we being all friends and for ever <HI>Powhatans.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="58">
With many such discourses they spent the day, quartring that night in the kings houses, the next day he reviewed his building, which hee little intended should proceed; for the Dutchmen finding his plenty, and knowing our want, and perceived his preparation to surprise vs, little thinking wee could escape, both him, and famine, (to obtaine his favour) revealed to him as much as they knew of our estates and proiects, and how to prevent them; one of them being of so good a iudgement, spirit, and resolution, &amp; a hireling that was certaine of wages for his labour, and ever well vsed, both he and his countrimen, that the Presi|dent knewe not whome better to trust, &amp; not know|ing any fitter for that imploiment, had sent him as a spie to discover <HI>Powhatans</HI> intent, then little doubting his honestie, nor could ever be certaine of his villany, till neare halfe a yeare after.</P>
<P>Whilst we expected the comming in of the coun|trie, we wrangled out of the king 10 quarters of corne for a copper kettle, the which the President perceived him much to effect, valued it at a much greater rate, but (in regard of his scarcety) hee would accept of as much more the next yeare, or else the country of <HI>Mo|nacan,</HI> the king exceeding liberall of that hee had not yeelded him <HI>Monacan.</HI> Wherewith each seeming well contented; <HI>Powhatan</HI> began to expostulate the diffe|rence betwixt peace and war, after this manner.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> you may vnderstand, that I, hauing seene the death of all my people thrice, and not one li|ving <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2+ letters"> course of peace and warre.</NOTE> of those 3 generations, but my selfe, I knowe the difference of peace and warre, better then any in my

Countrie. But now I am old, &amp; ere long must die, my brethren, namely <HI>Opichapam, Opechankanough,</HI> and <HI>Ke|kataugh,</HI> my two sisters, and their two daughters, are distinctly each others successours, I wish their expe|riences no lesse then mine, and your loue to them, no lesse then mine to you; but this brute from <HI>Nansamu~d</HI> that you are come to destroy my Countrie, so much affrighteth all my people, as they dare not visit you; what will it availe you, to take that perforce, you may quietly haue with loue, or to destroy them that pro|vide you food? what can you get by war, when we can hide our provision and flie to the woodes, whereby you must famish by wronging vs your friends; &amp; whie are you thus iealous of our loues, seeing vs vnarmed, and both doe, &amp; are willing still to feed you with that you cannot get but by our labours? think you I am so simple not to knowe, it is better to eate good meate, lie well, and sleepe quietly with my women &amp; childre~, laugh and be merrie with you, haue copper, hatchets, or what I want, being your friend; then bee forced to flie from al, to lie cold in the woods, feed vpon acorns roots, and such trash, and be so hunted by you, that I can neither rest, eat, nor sleepe; but my tired men must watch, and if a twig but breake, everie one crie there comes Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> then must I flie I knowe not whether, and thus with miserable feare end my mise|rable life; leauing my pleasures to such youth as you, which through your rash vnadvisednesse, may quickly as miserably ende, for want of that you never knowe how to find? Let this therefore assure you of our loues and everie yeare our friendly trade shall furnish you

with corne, &amp; now also if you would come in friend|ly manner to see vs, and not thus with your gunnes &amp; swords, as to invade your foes. To this subtil discourse the President thus replied.</P>
<P>Seeing you will not rightly co~ceaue of our words, wee striue to make you knowe our thoughts by our deeds. The vow I made you of my loue, both my selfe <NOTE PLACE="marg">C. Smiths reply</NOTE> and my men haue kept, as for your promise I finde it everie daie violated, by some of your subiects, yet wee finding your loue and kindnesse (our custome is so far from being vngratefull) that for your sake only, wee haue curbed our thirsting desire of revenge, else had they knowne as wel the crueltie we vse to our enimies as our true loue and curtefie to our friendes. And I thinke your iudgement sufficient to conceiue as well by the adventures we haue vndertaken, as by the ad|vantage we haue by our armes of yours: that had wee intended you anie hurt, long ere this wee coulde haue effected it; your people co~ming to me at <HI>Iames</HI> towne, are entertained with their bowes and arrowes with|out exception; we esteeming it with you, as it is with vs, to weare our armes as our apparell. As for the da~|gers of our enimies, in such warres consist our chiefest pleasure, for your riches we haue no vse, as for the hi|ding your provision, or by your flying to the woods, we shall so vnadvisedly starue as you conclude, your friendly care in that behalfe is needlesse; for we haue a rule to finde beyond your knowledge.</P>
<P>Manie other discourses they had, til at last they be|gan to trade, but the king seing his will would not bee admitted as a lawe, our gard dispersed, nor our men disarmed,
<PB N="63" REF="59">
he (sighing) breathed his mind, once more in this manner.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> I never vsed anie of <HI>Werowances,</HI> so kindlie as your selfe; yet from you I receaue the least <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatans im|portunitie for to haue them vnar+med, to betray them.</NOTE> kindnesse of anie. Captaine <HI>Newport</HI> gaue me swords, copper, cloths, a bed, tooles, or what I desired, ever ta|king what I offered him, and would send awaie his gunnes when I intreated him: none doth denie to laie at my feet (or do) what I desire, but onelie you, of who~ I can haue nothing, but what you regard not, and yet you will haue whatsoever you demand. Captain <HI>New|port</HI> you call father, and so you call me, but I see for all vs both, you will doe what you list, and wee must both seeke to content you: but if you intend so friendlie as you saie, sende hence your armes that I may beleeue you, for you see the loue I beare you, doth cause mee thus nakedlie forget my selfe.</P>
<P><HI>Smith</HI> seeing this Salvage but trifled the time to cut his throat: procured the Salvages to breake the ice, (that his boat might come to fetch both him and his corne) and gaue order for his men to come ashore, to haue surprised the king, with whom also he but trifled the time till his men landed, and to keepe him from suspition, entertained the time with this reply.</P>
<P><HI>Powhatan,</HI> you must knowe as I haue but one God, <NOTE PLACE="marg">C Smiths dis|course to delay time, that hee might surprise Powhatan.</NOTE> I honour but one king; and I liue not here as your sub+iect, but as your friend, to pleasure you with what I ca~: by the gifts you bestowe on me, you gaine more then by trade; yet would you visite mee as I doe you, you should knowe it is not our customes to sell our curte|sie as a vendible commoditie. Bring all your Country

with you for your gard, I will not dislike of it as being over iealous. But to content you, to morrow I will leaue my armes, and trust to your promise. I call you father indeed, and as a father you shall see I will loue you, but the smal care you had of such a child, caused my men perswade me to shift for my selfe.</P>
<P>By this time <HI>Powhatan</HI> hauing knowledge, his men <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatans plot to haue murde|red Smith.</NOTE> were readie: whilst the ice was breaking, his luggage women, and children fledde, and to avoid suspition, left 2 or 3 of his women talking with the Captaine, whilst he secretly fled, and his men as secretlie beset the house, which being at the instant discovered to Capt. <HI>Smith,</HI> with his Pistol, Sword &amp; Target, he made such a passage amongst those naked divels, that they fled be sore him some one waie some another, so that with|out hurt he obtained the Corps du-guard; when they perceiued him so well escaped, and with his 8 men (for he had no more with him) To the vttermost of their skill, they sought by excuses to dissemble the matter, and <HI>Powhatan</HI> to excuse his flight, and the suddaine co~|ming of this multitude, sent our Captaine a greate <NOTE PLACE="marg">A chain of perle for a present.</NOTE> bracelet, and a chaine of pearle, by an ancient Orator that bespoke vs to this purpose, (perceiving then fro~ our Pinnace, a barge and men departing &amp; comming vnto vs.) Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> our <HI>Werowans</HI> is fled, fearing <NOTE PLACE="marg">His excuse.</NOTE> your guns, &amp; knowing when the ice was broken there would come more men, sent those of his to guard his corne from the pilfrie, that might happen without your knowledge: now though some bee hurt by your misprision, yet he is your friend, and so wil continue: and since the ice is open hee would haue you send a|waie

A great manie they were, of goodlie well appointed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pretending to kill our men loded with bas|kets we forced the Salvages carrie them.</NOTE> fellowes as grim as divels; yet the verie sight of coc|king our matches against them, and a few words, cau|sed them to leaue their bowes &amp; arrowes to our gard, and beare downe our corne on their own backes; wee needed not importune them to make quick dispatch. But our own barge being left by the ebb, caused vs to staie, till the midnight tide carried vs safe abord, ha|ving spent that halfe night with such mirth, as though we never had suspected or intended any thing, we left the Dutchmen to build, <HI>Brinton</HI> to kil fowle for <HI>Pow|hatan</HI> (as by his messengers he importunately desired) and left directions with our men to giue <HI>Powhatan</HI> all the content they could, that we might inioy his com|pany at our returne from <HI>Pamaunke.</HI></P>

(the which were given them) they told him their co~|ming was, for some extraordinary tooles and shift of apparell, by this colourable excuse, they obtained 6. or 7. more to their confederacie, such expert theefes, that prese~tly furnished the~ with a great many swords, pike-heads, peeces, shot, powder and such like, they had Salvages at hand ready to carry it away, the next day they returned vnsuspected, leaving their confe|derates to follow, and in the interim, to convay them a competencie of all things they could, for which ser|vice they should liue with <HI>Powhatan</HI> as his chiefe affe|cted: free from those miseries that would happen the Colony. <HI>Samuell</HI> their other consort, <HI>Powhatan</HI> kept for their pledge, whose diligence had provided them, 300. of their kinde of hatchets, the rest. 50. swords, 8. peeces, and 8. pikes: <HI>Brinton, &amp; Richard Salvage</HI> seeing the Dutch-men so strangly diligent to accommodate the Salvages these weapons attempted to haue got to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, but they were apprehended; within 2. or 3. daies we arrived at <HI>Pamavnke,</HI> the king as many daies, entertained vs with feasting and much mirth: &amp; the day he appointed to begin our trade, the Preside~t, with <HI>M^r Persie, M^r West, M^r Russell, M^r Beheathland, M Powell, M^r Crashaw, M^r Ford,</HI> and some others to the number of 15. went vp to <HI>Opechancanougs</HI> house (near a quarter of a mile from the river,) where we founde <NOTE PLACE="marg">Opechanca|noughs abando|ned.</NOTE> nothing, but a lame fellow and a boy, and all the hou|ses about, of all things abandoned; not long we staide ere the king arrived, and after him came divers of his people loaded with bowes and arrowes, but such pin|ching commodities, and those esteemed at such a va|lue,

as our Captaine beganne with him in this man|ner.</P>
<P><HI>Opechancanough</HI> the great loue you professe with your tongue, seemes meere deceipt by your actions; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Smiths speech to Opechanca|nough.</NOTE> last yeare you kindly fraughted our ship, but now you haue invited me to starue with hunger.

<P>The king seemed kindly to accept his offer; and the better to colour his proiect, sold vs what they had to our own co~te~t; promising the next day, more co~pany, better provided; (the barges, and Pinnas being com|mitted to the charge of <HI>M^r Phetiplace)</HI> the President with his old 15 marched vp to the kings house, where we fou~d 4 or 5 men newly co~e with great baskets, not long after came the king, who with a strained cheere|fulnes held vs with discourse, what paines he had take~ to keepe his promise; til <HI>M^r Russell</HI> brought vs in news that we were all betraied: for at least 6. or 700. of well appointed Indians had invironed the house and beset <NOTE PLACE="marg">700 Salvages beset the Eng|lish being but 16.</NOTE> the fields.

dare do, but as I.

But this is the worst of all, wher in I pray aide me with your opinions; should wee be|gin with them and surprize this king, we cannot keep him and defend well our selues, if we should each kill our man and so proceede with al in this house; the rest will all fly, then shall we get no more, then the bodies that are slaine, and then starue for victuall: as for their fury it is the least danger; for well you know, (being a|lone assaulted with 2 or 300 of them) I made them co~ pound to saue my life, and we are now 16 &amp; they but 700. at the most, and assure your selues God wil so as|sist vs, that if you dare but to stande to discharge your peeces, the very smoake will bee sufficient to affright them; yet howsoever (if there be occasion) et vs fight like men, and not die like sheep; but first I will deale with them, to bring it to passe, we may fight for some thing, and draw them to it by conditions. If you like this motion, promise me youle be valiant. The time not permitting any argument, all vowed, to execute whatsoever he attempted, or die; wherevpon the cap|taine, approaching the king bespoke him in this man|ner.</P>
<P>I see <HI>Opechancanough</HI> your plot to murder me, but I <NOTE PLACE="marg">Smiths offer to Opechanca|nough.</NOTE> feare it not, as yet your men and mine, haue done no harme, but by our directions. Take therefore your arms; you see mine; my body shalbe as naked as yours;

before him in heapes, and (the bancke serving as a trench for retreat) hee drewe them faire open to his ambuscadoes, for he not being to be perswaded to go to visit their king, the King came to visit him with 2 or 300 men, in the forme of two halfe moons, with some 20 men, and many women loaded with great painted baskets; but when they approached somewhat neare vs, their women and children fled; for when they had environed and beset the fieldes in this manner, they thought their purpose fure; yet so trembled with fear as they were scarse able to nock their arrowes; <HI>Smith</HI> standing with his 3 men readie bent beholding them, till they were within danger of our ambuscado, who, vpon the word discovered themselues, and he retiring to the banke; which the Salvages no sooner perceived but away they fled, esteeming their heeles for their best advantage.</P>
<P>That night we sent to the fort <HI>M^r Crashaw</HI> and <HI>M^r Foard,</HI> who (in the mid-way betweene <HI>Werawocomoco</HI> and the fort) met 4 or 5. of the Dutch mens confede|rates going to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> the which (to excuse those gentlemens Suspition of their running to the Salva|ges returned to the fort and there continued.</P>

<P>Men maie thinke it strange there should be this stir for a little corne, but had it been gold with more ease we might haue got it; &amp; had it wanted, the whole col|lonie had starved.

But they fou~d that those damned Dutch-men had caused <HI>Powhatan</HI> to abandon his new house, and <HI>werawocomoco,</HI> and to carrie awaie all his corne &amp; provision; and the people, they found (by their means so ill affected, that had they not stood well vpon their guard, they had hardlie escaped with their liues. So the President finding his intention thus frustrated, &amp; that there was nothing now to be had, and therefore an vnfit time to revenge their abuses, helde on his course for <HI>Iames</HI> Towne; we having in this Iornie (for 25^l of copper 50^l of Iron and beads) kept 40 men 6. weekes, and dailie feasted with bread, corne, flesh fish, and fowle, everie man having for his reward (and in consideration of his commodities) a months provisi|on; (no trade being allowed but for the store;) and we
<PB N="76" REF="66">
delivered at Iames Towne to the Cape-Marchant 279 bushels of corne.</P>
<P>Those temporall proceedings to some maie seeme too charitable; to such a dailie daring trecherous peo|ple: to others vnpleasant that we washed not the ground with their blouds, nor shewed such strange in ventions, in mangling, murdering, ransaking, and de|stroying, (as did the Spaniards) the simple bodies of those ignorant soules; nor delightful because not stuf|fed with relations of heaps, and mines of gold and sil|ver, nor such rare commodities as the Portugals and Spaniards found in the East &amp; West Indies. The wa~t wherof hath begot vs (that were the first vndertakers) no lesse scorne and contempt, then their noble con|quests &amp; valiant adventures (beautified with it) praise and honor. Too much I confesse the world cannot at|tribute to their ever memorable merit. And to cleare vs from the worlds blind ignorant censure, these fewe words may suffise to any reasonably vnderstanding.</P>
<P>It was the Spaniards good hap to happen in those parts, where were infinite numbers of people, whoe had manured the ground with that providence, that it afforded victuall at all times: and time had brought them to that perfection, they had the vse of gold and silver, and the most of such commodities, as their cou~|tries afforded, so that what the Spaniard got, was on|ly the spoile and pillage of those countrie people, and not the labours of their owne hands. But had those fruitfull Countries, beene as Salvage as barbarous, as ill peopled, as little planted, laboured and manured as <HI>Virginia,</HI> their proper labours (it is likely) would haue
<PB N="77" REF="66">
produced as small profit as ours. But had <HI>Virginia</HI> bin peopled, planted, manured, and adorned, with such store of pretious Iewels, &amp; rich commodities, as was the Indies: then had we not gotten, and done as much as by their examples might bee expected from vs, the world might then haue traduced vs and our merits, &amp; haue made shame and infamy our recompence and reward.</P>
<P>But we chanced in a lande, even as God made it. Where we found only an idle, improvident, scattered people; ignorant of the knowledge of gold, or silver, or any commodities; &amp; carelesse of any thing but fro~ hand to mouth, but for bables of no worth; nothing to encourage vs, but what accidentally wee found na|ture afforded. Which ere wee could bring to recom|pence our paines, defray our charges, and satisfie our adventurers, we were to discover the country, subdue the people, bring them to be tractable, civil, and indu|strious, and teach them trades, that the fruits of their labours might make vs recompence, or plant such co|lonies of our owne that must first make provisio~ how to liue of themselues, ere they can bring to perfection the commodities of the countrie, which doubtles will be as commodious for England, as the west Indies for Spaine, if it be rightly managed; notwithstanding all our home-bred opinions, that will argue the contra|rie, as formerly such like haue done, against the Spani|ards and Portugals.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Salvages became subiect to the English.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_WHen the shippes departed, al the provision of the store (but that the President had gotten) was so rotten with the last somers rain, and eaten with rats, and wormes, as the hogs would scarsely eat it, yet it was the souldiers diet, till our returnes: so that wee found
<PB N="79" REF="67">
nothing done, but victuall spent, and the most part of our tooles, and a good part of our armes convayed to the Salvages. But now, casting vp the store, &amp; finding sufficient till the next harvest, the feare of starving was abandoned; and the company divided into tennes, fif|teenes, or as the businesse required. 4 houres each day was spent in worke, the rest in pastimes and merry ex|ercise; but the vntowardnesse of the greatest number, caused the President to make a generall assembly, and then he advised them as followeth.</P>
<P>Countrimen, the long experience of our late mise|ries, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presidents advise to the company.</NOTE> I hope is sufficient to perswade every one to a present correction of himselfe; and thinke not that ei|ther my pains, or the adve~turers purses, will ever main|taine you in idlenesse and sloth; I speake not this to you all, for diverse of you I know deserue both honor and reward, better then is yet here to bee had: but the greater part must be more industrious, or starue, how|soever you haue bin heretofore tolerated by the au|thoritie of the Councell from that I haue often com|manded you, yet seeing nowe the authoritie resteth wholly in my selfe; you must obay this for a law, that he that will not worke shall not eate (except by sick|nesse he be disabled) for the labours of 30 or 40 honest and industrious men, shall not bee consumed to main|taine 150 idle varlets. Now though you presume the authoritie here is but a shaddow, and that I dare not touch the liues of any, but my own must answer it; the letters patents each week shall be read you, whose co~|tents will tell you the co~trary. I would wish you there|fore without contempt seeke to obserue these orders
<PB N="80" REF="68">
set downe: for there are nowe, no more Councells to protect you, nor curbe my indeauors. Therefore hee that offendeth let him assuredly expect his due punish ment. Hee made also a table as a publike memoriall of every mans deserts, to encourage the good, and with shame to spurne on the rest to amendment. By this many became very industrious, yet more by severe punishment performed their businesse; for all were so tasked that there was no excuse could prevaile to de|ceiue him, yet the Dutchmens consorts so closely still convaid powder, shot, swords, and tooles, that though we could find the defect, we could not find by whom it was occasioned, till it was too late.</P>
<P>All this time the Dutchmen remaining with <HI>Pow|hatan,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dutchmens plot to murder Capt. Smith.</NOTE> received them, instructing the Salvages their vse. But their consorts not following them as they ex|pected, (to knowe the cause, they sent Francis their companion (a stout young fellow) disguised Salvage like) to the glasse-house, (a place in the woods neere a myle from <HI>Iames</HI> Towne) where was the randavus for all their vnsuspected villany, 40 men they procured of <HI>Powhatan</HI> to lie in Ambuscadoe for Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> who no sooner heard of this Dutchman, but hee sent to apprehend him, who fou~d he was gon, yet to crosse his returne to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> presently dis|patched 20 shot after him, and then returning but fro~ the glasse-house alone, hee incountred the king of <HI>Pas|paheigh,</HI> a most strong stout Salvage, whose perswasi|ons not being able to perswade him to his ambush, see+ing him only armed but with a fauchion, attempted to haue shot him; but the President prevented his shot
<PB N="81" REF="68">
by grapling with him, and the Salvage as well preven|ted him for drawing his fauchion, and perforce bore him into the river to haue drowned him; long they struggled in the water, from whence the king percei|ving two of the Poles vpon the sandes would haue fled; but the President held him by the haire &amp; throat <NOTE PLACE="marg">Smith taketh the king of Pas|paheigh prisoner</NOTE> til the Poles came in; then seeing howe pittifully the poore Salvage begged his life, they conducted him prisoner to the fort. The Dutchman ere long was also brought in, whose villany, though all this time it was suspected, yet he fained such a formall excuse, that for want of language, <HI>Win</HI> had not rightly vnderstood them, and for their dealings with <HI>Powhatan,</HI> that to saue their liues they were constrained to accommo|date his armes, of whome he extreamely complained to haue detained them perforce; and that hee made this escape with the hazard of his life, and meant not to haue returned, but only walked in the woods to ga|ther walenuts: yet for all this faire tale (there was so smal appearance of truth) hee went by the heeles; the king also he put in fetters; purposing to regaine the Dutch-men, by the saving his life; the poore Salvage did his best, by his daily messengers to <HI>Powhatan,</HI> but all returned that the Dutchmen would not returne, neither did <HI>Powhatan</HI> stay them, and bring them fiftie myles on their backes they were not able; daily this kings wiues children, and people, came to visit him with presents, which hee liberally bestowed to make his peace, much trust they had in the Presidents pro|mise, but the king finding his gard negligent (though fettered) yet escaped; Captaine <HI>Win</HI> thinking to pur|sue
<PB N="82" REF="69">
him, found such troopes of Salvages to hinder his passages, as they exchanged many volies of shot for flights of arrowes. Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> hearing of this, in returning to the fort tooke two Salvages prisoners, the one called <HI>Kemps,</HI> the other <HI>Kinsock,</HI> the two most exact villaines in the countrie; with those, Captaine <HI>Win,</HI> and 50 chosen men attempted that night to haue regained the king, and revenged his iniurie (and so had done if he had followed his directions, or bin advised by those two villaines, that would haue betraied both their king and kindred for a peece of copper, but hee trifling away the night, the Salvages the next morning by the rising of the sunne, braved him come a shore to fight, a good time both sides let flie at other, but wee heard of no hurt, only they tooke two Canows, burnt the kings house and so returned.</P>
<P>The President fearing those bravadoes, would but incourage the Salvages, begun himselfe to trie his co~|clusions; whereby 6 or 7 Salvages were slaine, as ma|ny <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Salu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">ges desire peace.</NOTE> made prisoners; burnt their houses, tooke their boats with all their fishing weares, and planted them at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne for his owne vse; and nowe resolved not to cease till he had revenged himselfe vpon al that had iniured him, but in his iourney passing by <HI>Paspa|heigh</HI> towards <HI>Chickahamina,</HI> the Salvages did their best to draw him to their ambuscadoes; but seeing him regardlesly passe their Countrey, all shewed the~selues in their bravest manner, to rrie their valours, he could not but let flie, and ere he could land, the Salvages no sooner knewe him, but they threw downe their armes and desired peace; their Orator was a stout young ma~
<PB N="83" REF="69">
called <HI>Ocanindge,</HI> whose worthie discourse deserveth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Geanindge his Oration.</NOTE> to be remembred; and this it was.</P>
<P>Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> my master is here present in this company thinking it Captaine <HI>Win,</HI> and not you; and of him hee intended to haue beene revenged, having never offended him: if hee haue offended you in esca|ping your imprisonment; the fishes swim, the fowles flie, and the very beastes striue to escape the snare and liue; them blame not him being a man, hee would en|treat you reme~ber, your being a prisoner, what paines he tooke to saue your life; if since he hath iniured you he was compelled to it, but howsoever, you haue re|venged it with our too-great losse, we perceiue &amp; well knowe you intend to destroy vs, that are here to in|treat and desire your friendship, and to enioy our hou|ses and plant our fields, of whose fruit you shall parti|cipate, otherwise you will haue the worst by our ab|sence, for we can plant any where, though with more labour, and we know you cannot liue if you want our harvest, and that reliefe wee bring you; if you promise vs peace we will beleeue you, if you proceed in reve~g, we will abandon the Countrie. Vpon these tearmes the President promised them peace, till they did vs in|iurie, vpon condition they should bring in provision, so all departed good friends, &amp; so continued till <HI>Smith</HI> left the Countrie.</P>
<P>Ariving at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, complaint was made to the President ihat the <HI>Chickahaminos,</HI> who al this while <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Saluage smo|thered at Iames Towne, and was recouered.</NOTE> continued trade, and seemed our friendes, by colour thereof were the only theeues, and amongst other things, a pistol being stolne, and the theese fled, there

were apprehended 2 proper young fellows that were brothers, knowne to be his co~federats. Now to regain this pistoll, the one we imprisoned, the other was sent to returne againe within 12 houres, or his brother to be hanged, yet the President pittying the poore naked Salvage in the dungeon, sent him victuall and some charcole for fire; ere midnight his brother returned with the pistoll, but the poore Salvage in the dungeon was so smothered with the smoke he had made, and so pittiously burnt, that wee found him dead, the other most lamentably bewailed his death, and broke forth in such bitter agonies, that the Preside~t (to quiet him) told him that if herafter they would not steal. he wold make him aliue againe, but little thought hee could be recovered, yet (we doing our best with aquavitae &amp; vineger) it pleased God to restore him againe to life, but so drunke and affrighted that he seemed lunaticke, not vnderstanding any thing hee spoke or heard, the which as much grieved and tormented the other, as before to see him dead; of which maladie (vpon pro|mise of their good behaviour afterward) the President promised to recover him and so caused him to be laid by a fire to sleepe, who in the morning (hauing well slept) had recovered his perfect senses; and then being dressed of his burning, and each a peece of copper gi|ven them, they went away so well contented, that this was spread amongst all the Salvages for a miracle, that Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> could make a man aliue that is dead; these and many other such pretty accidents, so ama|zed and affrighted both <HI>Powhatan</HI> and all his people that from all parts with presents they desired peace,

And after that, those that were taken stealing (both <HI>Powhatan</HI> and his people) haue sent them backe to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne to receiue their punishment, and all the countrie became absolutely as free for vs, as for themselues.</P>

We built also a fort for a retreat, neare a convenient river vpon a high commanding hill, very hard to be assaulted, and easie to be defended; but ere it was halfe finished this defect caused a stay; in searching our casked corne, wee found it halfe rotten, the rest so consumed with the many thousand rats (in|creased first from the ships) that we knewe not how to keepe that little wee had.

The 2. first years though by his adve~tures he had oft brought the Salvages to a tractable trade, yet you see how the envious authority ever crossed him, and frustrated his best endeavours. Yet this wrought in him that experi|ence and estimation among the Salvages, as other|waies it had bin impossible he had ever effected that he did, though the many miserable yet generous and worthy adventures, he had long, &amp; oft indured as wel in some parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> as in the most partes of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> by land or sea had taught him much, yet in this case he was againe to learne his Lecture by experience.

returning againe, graced by the title of Captaines of the passengers, seeing the admirall wanting, and great probabilitie of her losse: strengthned themselues with those newe companies, so railing and exclaiming a|gainst Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> that they mortally hated him, ere ever they see him. Who vnderstanding by his scouts, the arivall of such a fleet (little dreaming of a|ny such supply) supposing them Spaniards, hee so de|termined and ordered his affaires, as wee little feared their arivall, nor the successe of our incou~ter, nor were the Salvages any way negligent or vnwilling, to aide and assist vs with their best power, had it so beene, wee had beene happy.

The President seeing the desire those braues had to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The planting Nansamund.</NOTE> rule, seeing how his authoritie was so vnexpectedly changed, would willingly haue left all and haue retur|ned for England, but seeing there was smal hope this newe commission would ariue, longer hee would not suffer those factious spirits to proceed. It would bee too tedious, too strange, and almost incredible, should I particularly relate the infinite dangers, plots, &amp; prac|tises, hee daily escaped amongst this factious crue, the chiefe whereof he quickly laid by the heeles, til his lea sure better served to doe them iustice; &amp; to take away al occasions of further mischiefe, <HI>M^r Persie</HI> had his re|quest granted to returne for England, &amp; <HI>M^r West</HI> with 120 went to plant at the falles. <HI>Martin</HI> with neare as <NOTE PLACE="marg">A plantation of the falles.</NOTE> many to <HI>Nansamund,</HI> with their due proportions, of all provisions, according to their numbers.</P>
<P>Now the Presidents yeare being neere expired, he made <HI>Martin</HI> President, who knowing his own insuf|ficiencie, and the companies scorne, and conceit of his vnworthinesse, within 3 houres resigned it againe to Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> and at <HI>Nansamund</HI> thus proceeded. The people being contributers vsed him kindly: yet <NOTE PLACE="marg">The breach of peace with the Salvages.</NOTE> such was his iealous feare, and cowardize, in the midst of his mirth, hee did surprize this poore naked king, with his monuments, houses, and the Ile he inhabited; and there fortified himselfe, but so apparantly distrac|ted with fear, as imboldned the Salvages to assalt him, kill his men, redeeme their king, gather and carrie a|way more then 1000 bushels of corne, hee not once daring to intercept them. But sent to the President the~ the Falles for 30 good shotte, which from <HI>Iames</HI>

<P><HI>M^r West</HI> hauing seated his men at the Falles, pre|sently returned to revisit <HI>Iames</HI> Towne, the President met him by the way as he followed him to the falles: where he found this company so inconsiderately sea|ted, in a place not only subiect to the rivers invndatio~, but round invironed with many intollerable inconve|niences. For remedy whereof, he sent presently to <HI>Pow+hatan,</HI> to sell him the place called <HI>Powhatan,</HI> promising <NOTE PLACE="marg">Powhatan sold for copper.</NOTE> to defend him against the <HI>Monacans,</HI> and these should be his conditions (with his people) to resigne him the fort and houses and all that countrie for a proportion of copper: that all stealing offenders should bee sent him, there to receiue their punishment: that every house as a custome should pay him a bushell of corne for an inch square of copper, and a proportion of <HI>Po|cones</HI> as a yearely tribute to King <HI>Iames,</HI> for their pro|tection as a dutie: what else they could spare to barter at their best discreation.</P>
<P>But both this excellent place and those good con|ditions did those furies refuse, contemning both him, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutinies.</NOTE> his kind care and authoritie. the worst they could to shew their spite, they did.

yet in that retreate hee surprised one of the boates, wherewith hee returned to their shippe, wherein was their provisions, which also hee tooke. And well it chaunced hee found the marriners so tractable and constant, or there had beene small possibility he had ever escaped. Notwithsta~ding there were ma|ny of the best, I meane of the most worthy in Iudge|ment, reason or experience, that from their first lan|ding hearing the generall good report of his old soul|diers, and seeing with their eies his actions so wel ma|naged with discretion, as Captaine <HI>Wood,</HI> Captaine <HI>Web,</HI> Captaine <HI>Mone,</HI> Captaine <HI>Phitz-Iames, M^r Par|tridge, M^r White, M^r Powell</HI> and divers others. When they perceived the malice and condition of <HI>Ratliffe, Martin,</HI> and <HI>Archer,</HI> left their factions; and ever rested his faithfull friends: But the worst was, the poore Sal|vages that dailie brought in their contribution to the President, that disorderlie co~pany so tormented those poore naked soules, by stealing their corne, robbing <NOTE PLACE="marg">The breach of peace with the Salvages at the Falles.</NOTE> their gardens, beating them, breaking their houses, &amp; keeping some prisoners; that they dailie complained to Captaine <HI>Smith</HI> he had brought the~ for protectors worse enimies then the <HI>Monocans</HI> themselues; which though till then, (for his loue) they had indured: they desired pardon, if hereafter they defended themselues, since he would not correct them, as they had long ex|pected he would: so much they importuned him to punish their misdemeanores, as they offered (if hee would conduct them) to fight for him against them.

with their great guilded hopes, of seas, mines, commo+dities, or victories they so madly conceived. Then (see+ing nothing would prevaile with them) he set saile for <HI>Iames</HI> Towne: now no sooner was the ship vnder saile but the Salvages assaulted those 120 in their fort, fin|ding <NOTE PLACE="marg">An assault by the Salvages</NOTE> some stragling abroad in the woods they slew manie, and so affrighted the rest, as their prisoners es|caped, &amp; they scarse retired, with the swords &amp; cloaks of these they had slaine.

But at that Instant arri|ved <HI>M^r West,</HI> whose good nature with the perswasi|ons and compassion of those mutinous prisoners was so much abused, that to regaine their old hopes new turboiles arose. For the rest being possessed of al their victuall munition and everie thing, they grow to that height in their former factions, as there the President

left them to their fortunes, they returning againe to the open aire at west fort, abandoning Nonsuch, and he to <HI>Iames</HI> Towne with his best expedition, but this hapned him in that Iournie.</P>
<P>Sleeping in his boat, (for the ship was returned 2 <NOTE PLACE="marg">C Smith blowne vp with powder.</NOTE> daies before,) accidentallie, one fired his powder bag, which tore his flesh from his bodie and thighes, 9. or 10. inches square in a most pittifull manner; but to quench the tormenting fire, frying him in his cloaths he leaped over bord into the deepe river, where ere they could recover him he was neere drownd. In this estat, without either Chirurgio~, or chirurgery he was to go neare 100. miles. Ariving at <HI>Iames</HI> Towne cau|sing all things to bee prepared for peace or warres to obtain provisio~, whilest those things were providing, <HI>Martin, Ratliffe,</HI> and <HI>Archer,</HI> being to haue their trials their guiltie co~sciences fearing a iust reward for their deserts, seeing the President vnable to stand, &amp; neare bereft of his senses by reason of his torment, they had plotted to haue murdered him in his bed.

The prudent Councel, that he would not submit him|selfe to their stolne authoritie. <HI>Coe</HI> &amp; <HI>Drer,</HI> that should haue murdered him, were highly preferred for swea|ring, they heard one say, he heard <HI>Powhatan</HI> say, that he heard a man say: if the king would not send that corne he had, he should not long enioy his copper crowne, nor those robes he had sent him: yet those also swore hee might haue had corne for tooles but would not. The truth was, <HI>Smith</HI> had no such ingins as the king demanded, nor <HI>Powhatan</HI> any corne. Yet this argued he would starue them. Others complained hee would not let them rest in the fort (to starue) but forced the~ to the oyster bankes, to liue or starue, as he liued him|selfe. For though hee had of his owne private provisi|ons
<PB N="103" REF="79">
sent from England, sufficient; yet hee gaue it all a|way to the weake and sicke, causing the most vnto|ward (by doing as he did) to gather their food from the vnknowne parts of the rivers &amp; woods, that they lived (though hardly) that otherwaies would haue star+ved, ere they would haue left their beds, or at most the sight of <HI>Iames</HI> Towne to haue got their own victuall. Some propheticall spirit calculated hee had the Salva|ges in such subiection, hee would haue made himselfe a king, by marrying <HI>Pocahontas, Powhatans</HI> daughter. It <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pocahontas Powhatans daughter.</NOTE> is true she was the very nomparell of his kingdome, &amp; at most not past 13 or 14 yeares of age. Very oft shee came to our fort, with what shee could get for Cap|taine <HI>Smith,</HI> that ever loved and vsed all the Countrie well, but her especially he ever much respected: &amp; she so well requited it, that when her father intended to haue surprized him, shee by stealth in the darke night came through the wild woods and told him of it. But her marriage could no way haue intitled him by any right to the kingdome, nor was it ever suspected hee had ever such a thought, or more regarded her, or any of them, the~ in honest reason, &amp; discreation he might. If he would he might haue married her, or haue done what him listed. For there was none that could haue hindred his determination. Some that knewe not any thing to say, the Councel instructed, and advised what to sweare. So diligent they were in this businesse, that what any could remember, hee had ever done, or said in mirth, or passion, by some circumstantiall oath, it was applied to their fittest vse, yet not past8 or 9 could <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="2 letters">y much and that nothing but circumstances, which
<PB N="104" REF="80">
all men did knowe was most false and vntrue. Many got their passes by promising in England to say much against him. I haue ipresumed to say this much in his behalfe for that I never heard such foule slaunders, so certainely beleeued, and vrged for truthes by many a hundred, that doe still not spare to spread them, say them and sweare them, that I thinke doe scarse know him though they meet him, nor haue they ether cause or reason, but their wills, or zeale to rumor or opini|on. For the honorable and better sort of our Virgini|an adventurers I think they vndersta~d it as I haue writ it. For instead of accusing him, I haue never heard any giue him a better report, then many of those witnes|ses themselues that were sent only home to testifie a|gainst him. <HI>Richard Pots, VV.

It were to vild to say what we endured; but the occasion was only our owne, for want of providence, industrie, and governement, and not the barrennesse and defect of the countrie, as is generally supposed, for till then in 3 yeares (for the numbers were landed vs) we had never landed sufficient provision for 6 months such a glutton is the sea, and such good fellowes the marriners, wee as little tasted of those great proporti|ons <NOTE PLACE="marg">The fruits of im|p ovidences.</NOTE> for their provisions, as they of our miseries, that notwithstanding ever swaid and overruled the busi|nesse: though we did liue as is said, 3 yeares chiefly of what this good countrie naturally affordeth: yet now had we beene in Paradice it selfe (with those gover|nours)
