<HEAD>A DISCOURSE Of the Dukedom of Modena.</HEAD>
<P>_ANTIquITY was &s;o ignorant, as to divide the whole World into two parts onely, <HI>viz. ASIA</HI> and <HI>E&V;|ROPE;</HI> comprehending <HI>Africa</HI> under <HI>ASIA,</HI> as <HI>Eratosthenes</HI> an Author of as great e&s;teem as anti|quity; &s;ome under <HI>E&V;ROPE,</HI> as <HI>I&s;ocrates</HI> in his Panegyrique, and others mentioned in <HI>Salust, Lucan,</HI> and S. <HI>Austin de civitate Dei:</HI> but the mo&s;t celebrated Divi&s;ion was into three parts; <HI>E&V;ROPE, ASIA,</HI> and <HI>AFRICA</HI> or <HI>Libya;</HI> and this
<PB N="2" REF="3">was approv'd both by ancient and modern Authors. So that it appears, Co&s;mography was unacquainted with any other Divi&s;ion of the Univer&s;e, till that the knowing <HI>Genoue&s;e,</HI> about two Centuries ago, did furni&s;h it with a Fourth, by his di&s;covery of <HI>AMERICA,</HI> the mo&s;t u&s;ual, but improper name: for <HI>Columbus,</HI> after his ineffectual addre&s;&s;es to the States of <HI>Genoua, Anno</HI> 1486, and to <HI>Henry the</HI> 7^t^h of <HI>England,</HI> and their ab&s;olute refu&s;al; he &s;pun out &s;ix years in patient attendance at the Court of <HI>Ca|stile,</HI> where at la&s;t he was furni&s;hed out with three Ve&s;&s;els more proper for Di&s;covery than Conque&s;t. And thus he fir&s;t found it out, and led the way to the re&s;t. But <HI>Americus Ve&s;putius</HI> the <HI>Florentine,</HI> a man old in years, but young in courage, employed therein by <HI>Emanuel</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> &s;urveyed a great part of the Continent by the light he had from <HI>Columbus</HI> the fir&s;t Di&s;coverer; yet the <HI>Floren|tine</HI> prov'd the Godfather, and call'd it <HI>AMERICA,</HI> to perpetuate his own Name, and eternize his Me|mory. <HI>John Cabot</HI> a <HI>Venetian,</HI> in behalf of <HI>Henry</HI> the 7^t^h, di&s;covered all the North-ea&s;t coa&s;t thereof, and touched many places <HI>Americus</HI> ne'r &s;aw. And although the&s;e three <HI>Italians</HI> were by three &s;everal Monarchs employed to finde out this Fourth part of the World, it is &s;o va&s;t a Continent, that the Southern part is to this day altogether unknown; and u&s;ually in our Plani&s;pheres and Maps call'd <HI>Terra Australis incognita.</HI></P>
<P><HI>E&V;ROPE</HI> as to its Magnitude, (in the opinion of Co&s;mographers, who run all in the &s;ame current
<PB N="3" REF="3">or &s;tream) is inferiour to the other three; though to none of them, if you con&s;ider the moderate and whole&s;ome Temperature of the Air, together with the prodigious fertility of its Soyl; the two once-famous <HI>Romane</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Monarchies; the Study and Improvement of Arts both Liberal and Mecha|nical; the Affluence of all things that conduce ei|ther to the Support or Plea&s;ure of Man; or above all, the Purity and Sincerity of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion univer&s;ally profe&s;s'd in all the Dominions thereof; be&s;ides the well-regulated Government of their Realms, their Kings being Ab&s;olute Mo|narchs, but not Arbitrary Tyrants; and the men happie Subjects, not mi&s;erable Slaves; which keeps us from that Tyranny, Slavery, Inju&s;tice, frequent Bribery, Beggery and Barbari&s;m, which like an In|undation hath overflown all the <HI>A&s;iatick, African,</HI> and <HI>American</HI> parts, when they groan'd under the Yoke of their Idolatrous and Sanguinary Princes and Governours. <HI>Par nihil Europe, nihil e&s;t &s;e|cundum.</HI></P>
<P>ITALY is is a Region, that, among many other advantageous Elogies, is on all hands held to be the <HI>Eden</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> the Garden or Paradi&s;e of this North-we&s;t part of the World. This <HI>Penin&s;ula</HI> or Demi-I&s;land, formerly the ab&s;olute and redoubted Empre&s;s of the major part of the then-known habi|table World, yet may compare, as now it is, nay exceed the mo&s;t of the other Kingdoms of <HI>A&s;ia, A|frica,</HI> or <HI>America.</HI> 'Tis &s;ituate in a mo&s;t Tempe|rate Clime; and for the amoenity of its Cities, the
<PB N="4" REF="4">commodiou&s;ne&s;s for Commerce and Negotiations, the deliciou&s;ne&s;s of its Fountains and Aqueducts, the fertility of its well-cultivated Fields, in&s;omuch that in &s;ome places they have three Harve&s;ts in one year; the Uniformity and Stateline&s;s of Fabriques, and the rare Architecture and rich Furniture and Ornaments of its Temples, and many other Delica|cies to gratifie the <HI>gusto</HI> as to Fruits and rare Wines, with other Varieties too numerous to be crowded into the narrow confines of our intended Di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And in this Paradi&s;e or Garden of <HI>Europe</HI> there is a &s;mall <HI>Terroir,</HI> or plea&s;ant &s;pot of ground, known by the name of <HI>MODENA;</HI> where we will take the <HI>fre&s;co</HI> for &s;ome time, and give you our Senti|ments upon a &s;trict Survey of what &s;hall occur as ob&s;ervable during this our <HI>Promenade;</HI> and there|upon make &s;ome Remarques, which will prove the mo&s;t u&s;eful Materials, and mo&s;t conducive to the compliment of this our pre&s;ent E&s;&s;ay.</P>
<P><HI>MODENA</HI> is the Modern appellation; but it is better known to the Ancients by the name of <HI>Mu|tina;</HI> as <HI>Livie, Cicero, Pliny,</HI> &amp;c. Some read it <HI>Motina;</HI> as <HI>Antoninus</HI> and <HI>Dio: Strabo</HI> and <HI>Ptole|my</HI> <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF"> commonly <HI>Modena, &agrave; movendo</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Merula</HI> in his Co&s;mography) <HI>ut quidam in&s;ul&s;e con|jiciunt, eo qu&ograve;d Diluvio quondam tota fuerit &s;ub|mer&s;a, qua de re dignus Autore &s;uo Ver&s;iculus.</HI></P>

<P>Call'd <HI>Modena</HI> (a fooli&s;h conceit) becau&s;e it was once drowned with a Deluge. The more probable Conjecture is, that it was nam'd <HI>&agrave; movendo,</HI> be|cau&s;e it is at this day &s;omewhat removed from the &s;ituation of the ancient Citie, which the <HI>Longobards</HI> did totally ruinate and demoli&s;h.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Mutina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Dukedom of <HI>Mo|dena</HI> at pre&s;ent contains the Citie of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio,</HI> with the Lands and Territories thereunto adjoyning. They are both plea&s;antly &s;ituated in that part of <HI>Lombardy</HI> called <HI>Ci&s;padana,</HI> or as in their own Dialect vul|garly. <HI>Diqua del Po,</HI> on this &s;ide of the river <HI>Po.</HI></NOTE> now <HI>MODENA,</HI> was fir&s;t erected by the <HI>Etrurians</HI> or <HI>Tu&s;ci,</HI> now cal'd <HI>To&s;cans</HI> a people of <HI>Italy;</HI> and they waging War with the <HI>Galli Boii,</HI> were expelled thence by them, who after that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; and they being profligate by the Vi|ctorious Arm of the <HI>Romane</HI> Conquerors, it was by them made a Colony, together with <HI>Parma,</HI> in the 570 or 571 year after the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>Livie</HI> and other Hi&s;torians affirm, (<HI>Quintus Fabius Labio</HI> and <HI>Marcus Claudius</HI> being at that time Con&s;uls) who in &s;everal places make very honourable men|tion of it; an infallible te&s;timony that it was both rich and potent: which truth is more at large con|firm'd by the various In&s;criptions and ancient Mar|bles that are yet everywhere extant, and expos'd to the view of all Travellers.</P>
<P>This Citie was &s;ufficiently illu&s;trated and made famous in tho&s;e times, for the fir&s;t Battel between <HI>Antonie</HI> and <HI>C. Octavianus Cae&s;ar,</HI> who was then but
<PB N="6" REF="5">a Stripling or <HI>Tyro</HI> in War, and not above Eighteen years, and yet made Head of a new League again&s;t <HI>Antonius,</HI> whom the Senate lookt upon with an ill eye, as a common and dangerous Enemy. This happened in the year 711, when <HI>Antonius</HI> be&s;ieg'd <HI>C. Brutus</HI> in this Citie; but by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Cae|&s;ar Octavianus</HI> he gain'd the Victory. The mana|ging of the whole War was left to <HI>Hirtius</HI> and <HI>Pan|&s;a,</HI> at that time Con&s;uls. The fortune of the day was &s;o well managed on both &s;ides, that <HI>Antonie</HI> lo&s;t the Field, and the Con&s;uls their Lives; <HI>Cae&s;ar Octavianus</HI> remaining ab&s;olute Commander of a pui&s;&s;ant and numerous Army, into who&s;e favour he by his dexterity &s;o cunningly in&s;inuated him|&s;elf, and made &s;o good improvement of his Talent, and &s;uch advantage of the opportunity, that this prov'd the Ba&s;is and Foundation of his future Grandeur. But afterwards, when the &s;aid <HI>C. Octa|vianus, M. Antonius,</HI> and <HI>M. Aemilius Lepidus</HI> en|tred into the Society of the <HI>Triumvirate,</HI> there|upon the Citie had very cour&s;e u&s;age, and was ex|pos'd to very great Slaughter, by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, becau&s;e that it favoured <HI>Maxentius:</HI> but the Victory being once obtain'd, it was re&s;tor'd, and the Chri&s;tians became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it; it was dignified with an Epi&s;copal Seat, and <HI>Geminianus</HI> a Learned man made Bi&s;hop thereof. After this, it was reduced to a&s;hes by the Inundation of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Lombards,</HI> a furious and barbarous people, as S. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI> relates the Story, affirming that he &s;aw <HI>Modena</HI> with the re&s;t of the adjacent places upon
<PB N="7" REF="5">the <HI>Via Aemilia,</HI> &s;uffer a total deva&s;tation. But the&s;e Barbarians were afterwards expul&s;ed by the Empe|rour <HI>Charles</HI> the Great, who e&s;tabli&s;hed his &s;on <HI>Pe|pin</HI> King of <HI>Italy;</HI> and then the Citizens of <HI>Modena,</HI> who&s;e names were engraven on the gates, quitting their &s;ad but &s;ecure Retirements, whither they con|fin'd them&s;elves during the di&s;tractions and tur|moils that <HI>Italy</HI> then labour'd under, took coun&s;el how to rebuild this Citie: and in proce&s;s of time they erected it in that form as now it appears in. They being now their own Ma&s;ters, free from the Va&s;&s;alage of an in&s;ulting Enemy, and &s;olely at their own di&s;po&s;al, and having the Juri&s;diction within them&s;elves, they onely retain'd the <HI>Romane</HI> name; but yet were not &s;o much at re&s;t, but they had &s;e|veral Skirmi&s;hes with their Neighbours, e&s;pecially the people of <HI>Bologna,</HI> about the Limits and Bounds of their Country.</P>
<P>During the Di&s;tractions and Troubles of <HI>Italy</HI> between the Emperour and the Popes, <HI>Guido</HI> the Popes Legate, and then Bi&s;hop thereof, con&s;ign'd it over to <HI>Azo</HI> one of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Este,</HI> Lord of <HI>Fer|rara, Anno</HI> 1304, the Pope con&s;enting to it, upon the annual payment of the Tribute of 10000 Crowns. Since which time it hath been for the mo&s;t part in the power of that Hou&s;e; <HI>Ber&s;ius</HI> Marque&s;s of <HI>Ferrara</HI> being created Duke of <HI>Mutina</HI> by the Emperour <HI>Frederick</HI> the third. <HI>Anno</HI> 1312, &s;he had the Family of the <HI>Mirandulae</HI> her Ma&s;ters, by the Authority of the Emperour, <HI>anno</HI> 1319. the <HI>Bonacel&s;ii</HI> Tyrants of <HI>Mantua</HI> being compelled
<PB N="8" REF="6">thereunto by the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Guelphi. Anno</HI> 1331, the <HI>Pii</HI> governed her, at fir&s;t under the name of Captains, afterwards of Princes. Further|more, <HI>anno</HI> 1336, the <HI>Ate&s;tini</HI> or Family <HI>d'Este&eacute;</HI> &s;ucceeded them, who were Marque&s;&s;es of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> by the Popes leave and permi&s;&s;ion; and they go|verned it till the year 1510, when Pope <HI>Julius</HI> 11 took the Citie, and gave it to <HI>Maximilian</HI> 1, Em|perour, by whom it was afterwards, <HI>anno</HI> 1514, hy|pothequ'd to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth, for 10000 Crowns. La&s;tly, in the year 1527, when <HI>Clement</HI> the Pope was be&s;ieg'd by the lmperiali&s;ts, it was retaken by the Victorious Arms of the <HI>Atestini,</HI> or Family of <HI>Est&eacute;,</HI> by whom it was increa&s;ed with Buildings, Walls, and fenced with Ditches; and grew up by degrees to the pre&s;ent &s;plendour, &s;tate and gran|deur.</P>
<P>Thus far the ancient Authors, particularly <HI>Livy;</HI> and the modern al&s;o, as <HI>Blondus Corius, Platina, Sabellicus, Volaterranus,</HI> and <HI>Leandro;</HI> be&s;ides what we finde in the Annals of the Citie, and <HI>Bologna</HI> likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>MODENA</HI> is mar&s;halled by <HI>Pliny</HI> in the eighth Region of <HI>Italy,</HI> and call'd by <HI>Ptolemy</HI> a Citie of <HI>Gallia Togata;</HI> being wa&s;hed by the Rivulet or Brook <HI>Formigo.</HI> It was heretofore &s;ituated &s;ome|what higher towards the Mountains than now it is at pre&s;ent, as appears by the ruines of &s;ome antiqua|ted edifices &s;tanding &s;omewhat di&s;tant from the an|cient <HI>Modena,</HI> as <HI>Leandro</HI> intimates more at large.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P>The Citie is noble and &s;plendid, of an orbicular form, &s;eated in a Plain not far from the <HI>Apennines,</HI> which are called the Back, or rather Back-bone of <HI>Italy,</HI> becau&s;e, like the <HI>Spina</HI> in the body, they divide <HI>Italy</HI> into two parts or &s;ides, We&s;t or North. It is beautified with a Cathedral Church, the doors whereof are worthy admiration for many things, but particularly for the famous Marble-&s;tatues of <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve.</HI> It flouri&s;heth with the dignity of an Epi&s;copacie, which is &s;ubject to the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Bologna;</HI> and is al&s;o adorn'd with an Academy, in which <HI>Azo</HI> the Civilian taught the Imperial Law. It is a plea&s;ant Soyl, abounding with Fruits and Grains of all &s;orts, and the be&s;t Wine, called <HI>Vinum Tribianum.</HI> This Citie was greatly ampli|fied by <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> the &s;econd, Duke of <HI>Est&eacute;.</HI> 'Tis populous, and the inhabitants are noble and inge|nuous, and better natur'd than mo&s;t of <HI>Italy;</HI> they being quick in their re&s;olutions, ea&s;ie to be pacified when injur'd, debonnair and courteous in their en|tertainment and treating of &s;trangers. Though they are ill and fooli&s;hly treated by &s;ome over|cen&s;orious <HI>Italians,</HI> whe injuriou&s;ly nickname it <HI>Modena lapazza,</HI> Fooli&s;h <HI>Modena;</HI> it being a ma|licious and unde&s;erv'd reflection upon that people. The females are of a meek and patient temper, nei|ther too amorous, nor too coy; too courtly, nor too peevi&s;h; as they are in other places, for the generality: They are very much applauded al&s;o by Mr. <HI>Warcup,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Venice,</HI> where he enumerates the &s;everal Cities of <HI>Italy</HI> in Ver&s;e,
<PB N="10" REF="7">tran&s;lated out of the <HI>Italian;</HI> and concludes thus:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Foligno</HI>'s candi'd &s;treets most plea&s;ant are,</L>

<L>But <HI>Modena</HI> more happie is than &s;he.</L></Q>
<P><HI>Modena</HI> hath been the Nur&s;ery of many famous and learned men; &s;ome whereof are taken notice of by <HI>Nicolaus Leorinus Sile&s;ius,</HI> a learned and ele|gant Poet, in his Catalogue of Learned men that flouri&s;hed in his Age.</P>

<P>Thus the <HI>Atii</HI> became Ma&s;ters of a great part of <HI>Venice</HI> when <HI>Ateste</HI> was their capital Citie of Re&s;i|dence: and the <HI>Romane</HI> Cae&s;ars being then accu&s;to|med to create a Magi&s;tracie con&s;i&s;ting of eleven of the chief Citizens, and &s;ometimes a greater number, (who were al&s;o called <HI>Decuriones,</HI> becau&s;e at the fir&s;t in&s;titution ten onely were requir'd) <HI>Atius</HI> the &s;on of <HI>C.</HI> of the la&s;t Race, and the fir&s;t Author of the Family of the <HI>Atestini,</HI> did exerci&s;e this Magi|&s;tracie there. And this the In&s;cription of an old Stone doth &s;ufficiently prove, which to this day is pre&s;erv'd by the&s;e Princes. This <HI>C. Atius</HI> had two &s;ons; <HI>Aurelius,</HI> and <HI>Flavius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ateste</HI> being thus built, and the Metropolis of <HI>Venetia,</HI> was called afterwards <HI>Est&eacute;,</HI> and had four Gates oppos'd to the four quarters of the heaven; the <HI>Black,</HI> the <HI>White,</HI> the <HI>Triumphal,</HI> and the <HI>Capi|toline</HI> Gate, in the <HI>Romilian</HI> Tribe, &s;aith the Author. It was founded by the <HI>Atii,</HI> ruin'd by <HI>Acarinus,</HI> and re&s;tor'd by <HI>Aldoardus;</HI> and then 'twas made an Earldome, afterwards created a Marqui&s;ate, and enlarged; be&s;ieged by the <HI>Paduans,</HI> taken by <HI>Eze|linus,</HI> recovered by <HI>Azo,</HI> burnt by <HI>Ezelinus,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by tho&s;e of <HI>Padoa,</HI> and then re&s;tor'd to <HI>Azo,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Albertus.</HI></P>

<P>Thus you have in &s;hort a brief Narrative of the ancient <HI>Atii,</HI> the original of the <HI>Atestini,</HI> or <HI>Esten|&s;es,</HI> as our Modern Authors write them; which is the mo&s;t known name; and they are u&s;ually call'd the Dukes of <HI>Est&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>The Family <HI>d'Est&eacute;,</HI> at pre&s;ent Dukes of <HI>Modena,</HI> which are accounted in the number of the 7 Great Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> according to the ancient Divi&s;ion, which are, the Pope, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke of <HI>Savoy, To&s;cany, Modena, Parma</HI> and <HI>Montoa;</HI> they derive their Pedegree from <HI>Allo</HI> Marque&s;s of <HI>Est&eacute;</HI> who took upon him the Surname (which the Family is known by to this day) of the Citie <HI>Est&eacute;;</HI> and &s;till appertains to them <HI>de jure.</HI> He married <HI>Alda</HI> daughter to the Emperour <HI>Otho</HI> the fir&s;t; which happened <HI>an.</HI> 1000. and he had with her for Dower <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reggio. Theobaldo d'Est&eacute;, Otho</HI>'s Grandchilde, was &s;eized of <HI>Ferrara</HI> in the year 1055, from Pope <HI>John</HI> the 12: but they were di&s;&s;eiz'd and ab&s;olutely di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;t of it by <HI>Clement</HI> the 8, <HI>anno</HI> 1598, after the decea&s;e of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> the &s;econd, for want of lawful I&s;&s;ue male: yet <HI>Cae&s;ar d'Est&eacute;</HI> was then in being, who was &s;on of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> by <HI>Laura Ferrare&s;s;</HI> and he of|fered to clear it by manife&s;t proof, that his father was lawfully married to his mother, and he the le|gitimate Heir. But the Pope was too hard for him, being &s;urely po&s;&s;e&s;t of that which he &s;o greedily thir&s;ted after. And that Family &s;till lays claim to it by a legal preten&s;ion.

<P>Yet maugre all this oppo&s;ition, the Duke is &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Dukedoms of <HI>Modena</HI> and <HI>Reg|gio,</HI> the Principalities of <HI>Carpi</HI> and <HI>Correggio,</HI> the Earldom of <HI>Roli,</HI> and the Lord&s;hips of <HI>Sa&s;&s;evil, Gar|fagna,</HI> and <HI>Frignano,</HI> by the late Treaty of <HI>Pi&s;a.</HI> Here was indeed a di&s;pute between him and the Pa|pal Crown about the Valleys of <HI>Comachio;</HI> but this was not &s;o hot, b ut it cool'd at length, and was de|cided upon the&s;e Conditions: The Prince being to receive 400000 Crowns for them; which were ac|cordingly paid, and 40000 more for damages, and &s;ome other advantageous terms. The&s;e Lands which we have before &s;pecified, together with tho&s;e which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth in the Dukedome of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> yield him annually full 500000 Crowns. All his Domi|nions are contiguous, and joining clo&s;e one to the other; which renders him more con&s;iderable; and his &s;trength and force con&s;i&s;ts in the number of his people. <HI>Carfagnana</HI> alone (being a Province be|longing to him) is reported to have four&s;core and odde places well wall'd about, be&s;ides &s;everal other Strong-holds. He is able upon urgent occa&s;ions to lead into the Field 20000 of the Infantry, and 1000 of the Cavalry well arm'd and accoutred. And farther, he can without any inconveniencie what&s;o|ever maintain and keep half of that number. His His Country, tis true, and cannot be denied, lies o|pen to &s;everal bordering Princes; not for want of good places and well-fortified Ca&s;tles, for he hath many &s;eated at a very convenient di&s;tance; but the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e his <HI>Terroir</HI> or Land lies level, and upon even ground.</P>

<P>The Princes of <HI>Modena</HI> follow the general Ma|ximes of their Neighbours, <HI>viz.</HI> to keep a good cor|re&s;pondence with <HI>Venice,</HI> which was always repu|ted the Protectre&s;s of <HI>Italian</HI> Libertie: but &s;ince the lo&s;s of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> they kept clo&s;e to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> till their Intere&s;t of late wrought a change upon their inclinations. For Duke <HI>Francis</HI> was in the late <HI>Italian</HI> Wars made General of the French; and <HI>Mazarine</HI>'s Neece married to Prince <HI>Almerigo</HI> his &s;on, who hath left a young &s;on to &s;ucceed him. All things at pre&s;ent are managed by the advice of Car|dinal <HI>d'Est&eacute;,</HI> Protector of the French Intere&s;t at <HI>Rome,</HI> and the &s;ole Promoter of the late Union of his Hou&s;e to the French Crown. He is Uncle to the now Duke of <HI>Modena;</HI> a very active and &s;tir|ring per&s;on, and hath made the world &s;peak honou|rably of him, for his actions both in Peace and War. He is extraordinarily well skill'd in the art of con|cealing his re&s;entments, and under&s;tands the old Motto: <HI>Qui ne&s;cit di&s;&s;imulare,</HI> &amp;c. At <HI>Rome</HI> he keeps his Palace with more pomp and &s;plendour than any of the Cardinalate: and though 'tis very much frequented by the Nobility, and a numerous train of people, yet they are all con&s;tantly and well paid. He is a Zealot in the French Cau&s;e; by who&s;e friend&s;hip his Family is enriched and well moneyed, by rea&s;on of the late General&s;hip, as al&s;o the Coun|try: for the Souldiers took up their Winter-quar|ters in <HI>Modena;</HI> which occa&s;ioned a great re&s;ort of the chief Officers, as well as inferiour per&s;ons; and this did help the poor Populace to pay the Gabels,
<PB N="29" REF="16">with which they are heavily burthen'd. At pre&s;ent there is one of the Name and Relation, <HI>Carlo d'Est&eacute;;</HI> a Knight of the Order of the Fleece, who attended on the Empre&s;s.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> hath this advantage be|yond mo&s;t <HI>Italian</HI> Princes, that &s;ome of his Subjects have <HI>Feifs</HI> of the Empire.

But all Princes and Republicks in <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;olely excepted, do homage, or pay Tribute to the Pope or Emperour; and the Duke of <HI>Modena</HI> among the re&s;t does Homage to the Emperour for his whole State. <HI>Ranuccio</HI> the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> was married to the &s;i&s;ter of the late Duke, &s;he being his &s;econd Wife, his former dying without I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Duke of <HI>Modena, Francis</HI> the &s;econd, is very young; &s;o that we have nothing to mention of his Per&s;on: and if he were of years, we mu&s;t &s;ay of him, as of other Princes of <HI>Italy,</HI> They are extremely re&s;erv'd, live very retiredly, cautiou&s;ly receiving Forreigners; &s;o that &s;trangers rarely have admi&s;&s;ion into their Courts, or free acce&s;s to their Per&s;ons for any continuance.
