<OPENER><SALUTE>Madam,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> Have often ob&s;erved the In|convenience of too ob&s;tinately maintaining an Opinion con|trary to that which has generally obtained, and in &s;erious or weigh|ty Matters have carefully avoid|ed that Rock upon which I have known &s;ome to have been lo&s;t;
<PB REF="3"> but in our la&s;t Conver&s;e, the Sub|ject whereof was the Fine&s;s with which the Ladies and Gallants of this pre&s;ent Age manage their A|mours, which the Company then pre&s;ent unanimou&s;ly agreed was advanced to a perfection, no former Age could parallel; hav|ing uncontrouledly a&s;&s;erted the contrary; and perhaps too po&s;i|tively, and having given an In|&s;tance in &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages of above five hundred years ago, which you all would po&s;itively conclude to be a Fiction, till I &s;atisfi'd you, that I met with the Hi&s;to|ry in an antient Greek Manu|&s;cript, which by the Injury of time, and the Ignorance of the
<PB REF="3"> Per&s;ons, through who&s;e hands it had pa&s;&s;ed, was very imperfect, as having neither beginning nor ending; and in &s;ome places not legible, and with many interrup|tions of &s;ome excellent Pa&s;&s;ages, yet contain'd enough to ju&s;tifie my A&s;&s;ertion, and to convince the Hearers, that in that Age and Countrey, there were Per|&s;ons who lived much after our Mode, and that there is nothing new under the Sun. I thought I &s;hould have had the general applau&s;e of that illu&s;trious Com|pany, for having &s;o well ju&s;tified my &s;elf; but in&s;tead thereof, am puni&s;ht with their and your indi&s;|pen&s;ible Commands, to put what
<PB REF="4"> remains of that Piece; the &s;hort account whereof was agreeably received by you, into a Language intelligible to per&s;ons more con|cerned in affairs of that nature, than acquainted with the Tongue in which before now it was only extant. My Style, I know, is very unfit for the Subject, and my time de&s;igned for a far different Em|ployment; but rather than di&s;ob|lige &s;o many, and &s;o fair Friends, I have put a Force upon my &s;elf, and &s;eque&s;tered &s;ome few hours for this her View, but freely profe&s;s to you, it is a Piece very im|perfect in the Matter, by the Misfortune and Injury of many Ages, but more by the rudene&s;s
<PB REF="4"> of the Tran&s;lators Style, who in the Judgment of the Learned, will be cen&s;ur'd for having done the elegant Author much wrong; but in regard his Name is not known, and &s;o none can be con|cern'd for him, I cannot be con|demn'd to reparation, and there|fore with more confidence pre|&s;ent it to you, as it is with all its Defects.</P>

<PB N="2" REF="6"> Too late I perceive the difference between a Lover and a Hu&s;band. Where are the Vows, my dear <HI>Nicias,</HI> &s;o often made, be|fore he could prevail with me, to give him my heart? How often did he, with the mo&s;t &s;olemn Oaths prote&s;t, his whole Life &s;hould be employ'd to plea&s;e me: That he never would entertain &s;o much as a Thought, that &s;hould be di&s;agreeable to mine? That my Inclinations &s;hould govern his with a Sympa|thy? But he is now on a &s;udden grown po|&s;itive and imperious, as the Guardian Eunuch of the Palace, and inflexible as a peevi&s;h a|ged Father. While <HI>Nicerotis</HI> thus pa&s;&s;io|nately bewail'd her condition, <HI>Phylaenis</HI> who was employ'd in her Cabinet, and overheard &s;ome part of her Lamentation, coming from thence, and making u&s;e of the Confidence that was between them, thus interrupted her: Madam, What means this weakne&s;s in a Per&s;on of your Quality? It ill becomes one of your Under&s;tanding and Spirit, to grieve at the Traver&s;es of Fortune: Per&s;ons like you, either fore&s;ee their Adver&s;ities at a di&s;tance, and then con&s;ult how to avoid or oppo&s;e them, or when they are &s;urpriz'd, bear them with courage. Before you &s;ub|mitted your &s;elf to the Dominion of a Hu&s;|band, you &s;hould have believed tho&s;e that told you they are all Tyrants, who&s;e Will
<PB N="3" REF="6"> is their Law, and Intere&s;t their only affection; when their fir&s;t Heats are cool'd, their Pa&s;&s;ion becomes in the be&s;t of them Kind|ne&s;s, in &s;ome indifferency, but in the mo&s;t, an Aver&s;ion. If a poor Soul fall into the hands of one of them, if he be a Fool, &s;he is pre&s;ently per&s;ecuted with a thou&s;and Im|pertinencies, groundle&s;s Quarrels, Su&s;pitions, and Jealou&s;ies without cau&s;e, cro&s;s Humors, peevi&s;h, and always un&s;ea&s;onable Wars: But of the two, a wi&s;e man is the greater E|vil; &s;o many Precepts and Cautions, &s;uch Preten&s;ions and Circum&s;pection, a Woman had better for&s;wear the World, and be cloi|&s;ter'd up, then be bound to the Rules of his Order. Your Satyr again&s;t Marriage is al|together as un&s;ea&s;onable, reply'd <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> as my Complaints again&s;t Fortune; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, you have a little rais'd my Spi|rits, and made me &s;en&s;ible, 'tis fitter to think of &s;ome way to prevent, if it be po&s;&s;i|ble, this &s;udden Retreat, than vainly to be|wail it; the time is very &s;hort, and if your Invention be as happy in this In&s;tant, as I have &s;ometime found it, you &s;hall ever be my Tutelar Angel. <HI>Phylaenis,</HI> who was a Per|&s;on of Experience, as well as great pre&s;ence of mind in &s;uch Affairs, had formed in her thoughts an Expedient, which &s;o pleas'd her own Fancy, that with great a&s;&s;urance,
<PB N="4" REF="7"> and Gaity in her Countenance, &s;he cry'd out, Madam, be no more afflicted; if you can re|&s;olve not to be wanting, to your &s;elf, I dare promi&s;e to &s;top your Journey for &s;ome months, if you will con&s;ent to &mdash; At this word, <HI>Niceas</HI> entred the Room, and <HI>Phylaenis</HI> in &s;ome confu&s;ion, for fear &s;he had been overheard by her Lord, withdrew, to leave it to her Lady, to receive the fir&s;t E|ruption of his Re&s;entments; but he coming in great ha&s;t, as being intent upon the Exe|cution of a De&s;ign, which he knew admit|ted no delay, where the lea&s;t omi&s;&s;ion might prove an unavoidable ruine, was &s;o taken up with it, that if he overheard any of their Words, he yet knew not that he did: Ma|dam, &s;ays he, I have been to perform tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Civilities for you, to tho&s;e of your Friends and Relations, who are mo&s;t con|cerned in you, and I have &s;atisfi'd them, that it is indi&s;pen&s;ibly requi&s;ite for pre&s;erving my Life and Honour, that we proceed immedi|ately on our Journey: The Galley lies ready upon her Oars in a week without the Harbour, and I am come to conduct you thither; there is no time to be lo&s;t, call your Woman, and let us be going, we &s;hall have better lei&s;ure to di&s;cour&s;e the motives of this &s;o &s;udden re&s;olution in our Voyage, and taking her by the hand, he call'd out to <HI>Phylaenis</HI> to fol|low
<PB N="5" REF="7"> her Lady, and &s;aid he had given order to the Steward, to &s;end all their Nece&s;&s;aries by another way, to meet them at the Ship &s;ide. The Surprize was mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing to <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> but giving her hand to her Lord, <HI>Nicias,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, you are all the World to me, and where-ever I go with you, that place will be more plea&s;ing to me, than all the Delights and Glories of <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 span"> I cannot only be content but happy with you in a De&s;art: Let us go then; where you plea&s;e, and though I have been in&s;tructed, the great Re&s;pects that ought to be paid to Relations, Familiars, and Superiours upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, and that the neglect of them, does always, if not de&s;troy, at lea&s;t dimini&s;h the e&s;teem that per&s;ons of Quality ought to de&s;ire to live in, in the World; I have now learnt, that an ab&s;olute conformity to the Government of a Hu&s;band is the greate&s;t Duty, as well as Felicity of a Wife. Madam, reply'd <HI>Nicias,</HI> as we go, I will &s;atisfie all your Scruples; and to convince you of the nece&s;&s;ity of this abrupt departure, that you will confe&s;s, I only wanted time to let you know the Rea&s;ons of it beforehand, to have made it your Re&s;olution before it was mine. By this time they were at the Chariot, and being entred, were &s;oon at the Water-&s;ide, having only to pa&s;s a Back-way by the Walls
<PB REF="8"> of the Palace-Gardens; &s;o that unob&s;erv'd they went aboard the Gally that attended them, and immediately &s;etting forward with a gentle &s;troak of their Oars, they made no great ha&s;t, that a &s;mall Sloop, which was to bring their Servants and Nece&s;&s;aries, ju&s;t with the fall of Night, might overtake them. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> follow'd by her Woman, was con|ducted into the State-room of the Gally by the Captain, who leaving her there, went out to wait on <HI>Nicias,</HI> who was got upon the Poop, to ob&s;erve the plea&s;ant Shores on both &s;ides the <HI>Helle&s;pont;</HI> and to take notice of Landmarks, by which the Pilots govern their Cour&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Straits. The Day being calm, and the motion of the Ve&s;&s;el &s;teady and &s;low, the Lady and her Wo|man did not yet perceive that Di&s;compo&s;ure creeping on them, which being at Sea, brings upon mo&s;t Con&s;titutions not accu&s;tomed to it, &s;o that they were not interrupted by it, to entertain them&s;elves with the Di&s;cour&s;e of their pre&s;ent Condition; and <HI>Phylaenis</HI> fir&s;t breaking &s;ilence, Madam, &s;aid &s;he, it is no time to &s;hew your Ladi&s;hip, the means I had found out to have retarded this Voyage, which I had ju&s;t then modell'd, and was going to propo&s;e to you when my Lord came upon us, and I fear, overheard &s;ome part of a Conver&s;ation, which may hereafter
<PB N="7" REF="8"> breed trouble&s;ome apprehen&s;ions in a Head &s;o capricious as his. You may be &s;ecure from any fear of that kind, &s;ays <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> for his mind was &s;o intent upon the De&s;ign he was to execute, of removing me from Court, that I believe there mu&s;t have been &s;ome great violence offer'd him, to have made him take notice of any thing el&s;e. There is no remedy, now we are wholly in his power, and there is nothing to be done, but to put on a good Countenance, and to appear pleas'd with what cannot be avoided; though I would venture a thou&s;and Lives in the attempt of returning to the Palace, and to appear there but one hour, &s;o it could be ef|fected without blemi&s;h to my Honour. You know it is but two dayes &s;ince the Prince <HI>Athemi&s;tius</HI> made me a Vi&s;it at my Lodgings; and after he had a while entertained the Com|pany there with me, with the mo&s;t diverting Conver&s;ation in the World, and charm'd us all into an Admiration of his Wit, he took me a&s;ide to a Window, and with a voice lower then to be heard by any pre&s;ent but my &s;elf; Madam, &s;ays he, I ought to be very wel|come to you, on this Vi&s;it, for I come to tell you, that your Beauty, (which in the &s;hort time you have appear'd at Court, has in&s;pir'd all the Men with Love, and the Ladies with Envy) is ready to advance you above all
<PB N="8" REF="9"> their Pa&s;&s;ions, and above their Qualities too; for I come from our Imperial Ma&s;ter, to tell you, that he ob&s;erves nothing in his Royal Palace &s;o glorious as you, and that he begs (who commands us all) that you will make your Court to the Empre&s;s, and be con&s;tant at her &s;ide at the u&s;ual hour, when he will take the fir&s;t opportunity to tell you him&s;elf the Value he has for you. I heard this with &s;everal inward Commotions, and not without a guilty Blu&s;h, which di&s;covered, I well enough under&s;tood what was the meaning of this Complement, and was going to make an An|&s;wer, that would have better &s;uited a vertuous Prudence, then the Princes De&s;ign; when he &s;topt me, &s;aying, Madam, I mu&s;t beg your Par|don, if I do not permit you to charge me with an An&s;wer: I have executed my Commi&s;&s;ion fully, and his Maje&s;ty will better under&s;tand how you receive his Commands, by your obeying them, then by any words I can de|liver from you. And thus breaking off with me, he addre&s;t his Di&s;cour&s;e to a Kin&s;woman of mine, who had po&s;&s;e&s;t the Emperors Fa|vour in the highe&s;t degree for &s;ome years, and rallying her at his u&s;ual rates, upon &s;ome Intrigues that were not under&s;tood by the re&s;t of the Company, &s;ome piquant Repart&eacute;es pa&s;t between them; and at la&s;t the Prince &s;aid to her, Madam, let us not be angry,
<PB N="9" REF="9"> we &s;hall &s;hortly be upon more equal terms, and then we may agree or fall out, as the hu|mour takes us. This put an end to his Vi&s;it, and put the Dutche&s;s into &s;uch a Fret, that the re&s;t of the Company taking notice of it, one after another took their Leaves and de|parted, and &s;he and I being left alone, &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately breaks out into the&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ions: I mu&s;t no longer endure the In&s;o|lencies of <HI>Athemi&s;tius;</HI> his Buffoonery plea&s;es, 'tis true, the Emperor; but when I let him know how often it is unea&s;ie to me, and with how little re&s;pect he treats me in all Companies, he will be made &s;en&s;ible of his Folly, in u&s;ing his Wit again&s;t me, that has more powerful ways of &s;ecuring her Intere&s;t, than pratling. I could not but &s;mile at the&s;e Threats, when I reflected on the Me&s;&s;age I had ju&s;t then received, and &s;aw that what the Prince &s;aid to her, might be grounded upon the Pro&s;pect he had of the Affair he was then engag'd in; which &s;he perceiving, Cou&s;in, &s;ays &s;he, I hope the ill U&s;age I have had from <HI>Athemi&s;tius,</HI> or the Di&s;order it has put me in, is no occa&s;ion of your appearing &s;o well plea&s;ed. Madam, &s;aid I, I have too much Intere&s;t in you, to be pleas'd at any thing that di&s;plea&s;es you; but I could not without &s;ome di&s;dain, think of the Carriage of the Prince, who, though he be a man of
<PB N="10" REF="10" MS="y"> extraordinary Wit, I take to be one not of ordinary Di&s;cretion, who after having en|tertained me with Expre&s;&s;ions of the highe&s;t re&s;pect, &s;hould &s;o &s;oon forget him&s;elf before my face, at that rate to u&s;e a Per&s;on of your Grandure, to whom I had the honour to be related, I &s;hall frame this Action, take my Mea&s;ures how to value him: beware of him, &s;ays &s;he, he makes Love to every new Face, and whatever his Succe&s;s be, he makes it the &s;ubject of his Rallery in the next Company. Keep your &s;elf upon your Guard, take my Advice, and have no Conver&s;e with the mo&s;t uncertain Per&s;on in the World. She took leave, and waited on her to her Cha|riot, and returning, fell into con&s;idera|tion of the Commands <HI>Athemi&s;tius</HI> had brought me: I became very pen&s;ive, and retir'd into my Cabinet, and lock|ing my &s;elf up there, that I might with|out interruption examine my Heart, which I found began to be intere&s;&s;ed what it would have me do, I ballanc'd a thou&s;and things, before I could ob&s;erve the Scales to turn; the Precepts of Religion, and the Rules of Mo|de&s;ty, in which I had been carefully in&s;truct|ed in my Childhood; the faith I had given to <HI>Nicias;</HI> the Love I really have for him, and his great Merits; his lovely Per&s;on, and graceful Meen; his Gallantry, and obliging
<PB N="11" REF="10"> De|meanour towards me, were irre&s;i&s;tible Ar|guments to confirm me in my Virtue: but on the other hand, the Glories of the mo&s;t &s;plendid Court in the World, the Charms of Wealth and Power, and the Ambition of Pre|cedency, which is a mo&s;t vehement Pa&s;&s;ion in our Sex: the glory of being concern'd in the Intrigues of Court and State; and the Pride to &s;ee the Grecian <HI>Monarch</HI> at my Feet, began to incline the Scale, and &s;eem more weighty; and I was about to have call'd for you, to take your Judgment in a Ca&s;e of this importance, when my own heart told me, if thou would&s;t be happy, pre&s;erve thy Innocence, 'tis that will make all things plea&s;ant, and without it there is no Enjoy|ment, but has more of Gall than Sweetne&s;s. This divine Thought &s;o ravi&s;ht and po&s;&s;e&s;t my Soul, that I immediately re&s;olved to de|&s;pi&s;e all tho&s;e Allurements, to de&s;ire to be no|thing, but what was mo&s;t grateful to my dear <HI>Nicias;</HI> to look upon <HI>Athemi&s;tius,</HI> as the mo&s;t unworthy Per&s;on in the World, who being of the greate&s;t Quality, would take upon him the ba&s;e&s;t of Imployments. I determin'd to take no notice of what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and I, no not to you, in whom I have an entire Confidence, to a|void the Court, and divert my &s;elf in our Family, and among my Relations, which
<PB N="12" REF="11"> are numerous and honourable enough to af|ford all the Delights of virtuous Conver&s;ati|on; and thus having compo&s;ed my &s;elf, and pa&s;s'd the re&s;t of that and the next day, after my u&s;ual manner, as you very well know; for if you could have ob&s;erv'd any change, I am &s;ure you would have enquired into the cau&s;e of it. Ye&s;ternight <HI>Nicias</HI> came home &s;omewhat earlier then was his Cu&s;tom, and with a Countenance that di&s;covered more of concern, than I had ever ob&s;erved in him, finding me alone; Madam, &s;ays he, read this Paper, giving me a Billet, directed to the Lord <HI>Nicias,</HI> which contained the&s;e words; <HI>This is a De&s;ign,</HI> Nicias, <HI>again&s;t your Ho|nour, which nothing can prevent, but the &s;udden Removal of the Fair</HI> Nicerotis <HI>from the Court, your Sword nor your Friends, mu&s;t not &s;erve you in this occa&s;ion, or el&s;e I &s;hould not be the Man that could advi&s;e you to fly from the Danger.</HI> By this I per|ceive the Secret had taken vent at Court, but re&s;olv'd not to &s;eem to under&s;tand the meaning of it: I cry'd out, what Riddle is this, my Lord?

Having &s;etled his Thoughts as well as he could, and adju&s;ted all this Affair with his Ho&s;t, whom he entirely tru&s;ted, having largely obliged him, he went very melancholy out of Town, towards his Ser|vants, and who had attended him after their Sport was over, near an hour longer than it was u&s;ual, and with them went on to the Shoar, where they found the Boat in readi|ne&s;s: For <HI>Dictyon</HI> had long left off his Fi&s;h|ing, being impatient with the De&s;ire of ex|ecuting his De&s;ign, and with fear, that &s;ome|thing might di&s;appoint it, or the &s;udden Death of his Wife, might make his Ma&s;ter apprehend &s;ome foul play.

When he came to it, he found not the Servant he left there; but having not lei&s;ure to wait for him (being under ap|prehen&s;ion of a Di&s;covery) he ha&s;tily be|&s;tows his Carriage aboard, and with the help of him that was with him, he put off to Sea.

The Authority of the Father, the Virtue and Prudence of the Mother, the Gallantry and Beauty of the Children, drew together &s;uch a Concour&s;e of the Nobility and Gentry, that <HI>Lycias</HI> his Court had no &s;mall re&s;emblance of the Emperors, and yet when <HI>Nicerotis</HI> fir&s;t appear'd there, &s;he pre&s;ently became the Idol of one Sex, but the Envy of the other: The Ladies, who could &s;py no fault in her Face, in her Stature, or Meen, in her Wit, or Deport|ment, in a &s;hort time began to blame her Conduct, the Gallants of the Court and Town made their Re&s;ort where &s;he frequen|ted, &s;he was de&s;ired of every one that had Quality enough, to pretend to her Favour; Comedies and Balls were more frequently

He vi&s;ited her often; he omitted no occa&s;ion of &s;eeing her, either in publick or private, and gave her &s;uch E|vidences of his Pa&s;&s;ion, as could not but con|vince her of it; he made Pre&s;ents to <HI>Phile|nis,</HI> and by that means had her whole Coun|cel in Pen&s;ion; &s;o that &s;he could take no Re&s;olutions, but what were in his Favour, nor di&s;cover her Sentiments, but immediate|ly he had notice of them: For <HI>Philenis</HI> was the only Per&s;on &s;he had intire confidence in, and for whom &s;he had nothing of re&s;erve. One Morning, &s;ays <HI>Nicerotis</HI> to her, How impo&s;&s;ible is it to re&s;i&s;t the Court&s;hip of <HI>Leontius? Nicias,</HI> &s;ince his coming to his own Country, having tempted me from mine, either de&s;pites me as a Stranger, or has received &s;ome former commerce, or has abandoned him&s;elf to the Debauch; I have little of his Company, and his Kindne&s;&s;es are both rarer and le&s;s agreeable than formerly.

Alas, Madam! Life is an uncertain thing, and at the be&s;t, tho&s;e Mi|nutes of it that are de&s;igned by Fate for Happine&s;s, are &s;o few, that to let any of them pa&s;s unimployed, is an incorrigible Er|ror, and a lo&s;s that is but meanly recompen|ced, by the Opinion one gains among tho&s;e only that are pa&s;t the reli&s;hing of Plea&s;ures. I did not think, &s;ays <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> &s;o much rea|&s;on could be given for Sinning; I thought the mo&s;t could be &s;aid for it, was that pa&s;&s;ion might excu&s;e Women in Love, as it does Men in Murder: But be it as it will, my heart has betrayed me to <HI>Leontius,</HI> and I blu&s;h to think what his &s;ucce&s;s will be at the next a&s;|&s;ault.

However the&s;e two Lovers were &s;o well &s;atisfied with one another, that they lived in an exact Corre&s;pondence; no Jea|lou&s;ies, no Capricious, no little Peeks di|&s;turbed good Humour, no unhappy Acci|dents put them out of their Mea&s;ures; till <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> weary of &s;o ea&s;ie delights, took a Freak in her head, and would needs appoint her Gallant a Rendezvous abroad; &s;he told him, &s;he had by accident been at one of the Gardens near the Town, where they &s;ell their Fruit, and the choice&s;t of all &s;orts, and where was the prettie&s;t Labyrinth for Lovers to lo&s;e them&s;elves in that could be imagin|ed; &s;he de&s;ired he would meet her there the next day, an hour before Sun, without any Retinue, that they might not be known; he ea&s;ily agreed to any thing &s;he propo&s;ed, and being a Frollick of her own, &s;he was the earlie&s;t up, &s;he and her Woman put on the Dre&s;s of the &s;pruce&s;t of tho&s;e &s;ort of Girls, that carry Fruit among Per&s;ons of Quality, at the Theaters and publick Pa|zades, and with their Baskets on their Arms, went privately out of her Lodgings to the Place appointed; they knockt up the Gar|diners, and demanded to have entrance, and have &s;uch and &s;uch Fruits gathered; the Fel|lows went about what they were directed,

The young Gardiner <HI>Cornelius,</HI> who after his Fright was a little over, found the reli&s;h of the ravi&s;hed Ki&s;&s;es on his Lips, &s;et him&s;elf to watch the two Women and this

This Evening a new Habit was brought home for the Page, which was ordered again&s;t the next ap|proaching Solemnity; do you &s;end for it into your Chamber, on pretence, that I have directed &s;omewhat to be altered about it, and let that, with the other Accoutre|ments of &s;uch an Officer, be provided ready in the Garden-hou&s;e, in the Morning, by the dawn of day; I will carry him a Vi&s;it, as from my &s;elf, and by that Pretence, will learn among his Servants, how he &s;pent this Night.

She pre&s;t between them to the Door, and knockt hard, which made the Gentlemen lay hold of her, to take her away by force, and turn her out of the Pa|lace; But &s;he &s;truggling with them, made &s;uch a &s;tir, that the Lord call'd to know what was the matter? and one going in, he angerly askt what meant that noi&s;e, who was told the whole Rudene&s;s of the Page; he ordered his Admittance, and being willing to receive the Me&s;&s;age privately, commanded his Servant to &s;tay without and &s;hut the Door. The Struggling had rai&s;ed a mo&s;t love|ly Red in her Face, and &s;o di&s;ordered her Hair, that was tru&s;t up under a Peruke, that the long Trails of it falling down as &s;he made her Bows, in advancing to the Bed|&s;ide; he needed no other Di&s;covery, but rai&s;|ing him&s;elf in his Bed, he reached out his Arm

It was an unfore|&s;een and unre&s;i&s;tible Accident that kept me from you, and when you hear it, you will confe&s;s that you ought not to be angry with me, unle&s;s you will impute Misfortune as a Crime, and believe Puni&s;hments were devi&s;|ed for the Unhappy, not for the Guilty. I was la&s;t night invited to a Treat, by &s;ome of the Officers of my Army, I do not

We were all very forward to pay him tho&s;e Re&s;pects that are due to his Qua|lity, and to the Reputation he ju&s;tly holds among Souldiers, and a Gla&s;s or two going round, had &s;o improved the Humour, he had put him&s;elf into &s;ome other place, that he would take upon him to give Law to us all, which I would not have allow'd to any body, not &s;o nearly related to you; he pre&s;&s;ed &s;o upon us, that without being rude to him, we could not break up, till we all were become as unruly as he, and I believe 'tis not two hours &s;ince we parted.

She departed pretty well &s;atisfied, and return'd to the Garden-hou&s;e where <HI>Philaenis</HI> attended her, and the Lord compo&s;ed him&s;elf to re&s;t as &s;oon as he could, for the Reflections he could not avoid to make upon this Adventure; about three hours after, when he was ri&s;ing, <HI>Polyphon,</HI> one of tho&s;e Commanders who had been with him over night, came to vi&s;it him, and to enquire how he did, after that unu&s;ual Skir|mi&s;h he had been engag'd in. He told him, he &s;uffered deeply for that Exce&s;s, and was re&s;olved not to allow him&s;elf the like Liber|ty again for any Re&s;pect; <HI>Polyphon</HI> told him, it was for want of u&s;e, and he would find it
<PB N="42" REF="26"> to agree with him after a little Practice; I had rather, &s;aid <HI>Leontius,</HI> you and the re&s;t of my Friends would find it as inconvenient as I do, for I look upon Drinking, to be a Vice as unbecoming Souldiers as any Pro|fe&s;&s;ion what&s;oever. My Lord, &s;ays he, mer|rily, that is a Doctrine will hardly obtain a|mong us, whil&s;t we are out of Action; in time of War 'tis enough to be Sober; in Peace, we have nothing el&s;e to do but drink and make Love. Does your Lord&s;hip hear nothing of the Emperors De&s;igns this Spring?

But, &s;ays he, I leave

My Lord, &s;ays <HI>Polyphon,</HI> you need not name her, for your Amour has not been as great a Secre|cy as you imagined, and if you abandon your Intere&s;ts in her, every one may, with|out di&s;obliging you, pretend to his own Ad|vantages.&mdash;I am not &s;o ill natured, &s;ays <HI>Le|ontius,</HI> to envy my Friends their good For|tune, nor &s;o great a Fool, to expect to con|fine a Humour, that I know hates all Con|&s;traint. And &s;ince I can make her no A&s;&s;u|rances of my Return, it is ju&s;t I &s;hould leave her to her own Liberty. This was a &s;uffici|ent Evidence of an Indifferency, that not long before, all the World could not have convinced him, he &s;hould ever be guilty of. The News of the Town, carried the Inti|mation of his being commanded to Court, before he him&s;elf brought it to <HI>Nicerotis;</HI> it put her into a thou&s;and Troubles, which &s;he did not long defer to let him know, for his Affairs having kept him one day from wait|ing on her, the next Morning he received this Billet from her. <HI>You need not joyn &V;nkindne&s;s with the nece&s;&s;ity of your leav|ing me, the one or the other has Force e|nough to kill</HI> Nicerotis.

His Spy, &s;oon gave him an Account of this Pa&s;&s;age, and his Curio&s;ity pre&s;&s;ed him to pry farther into the Affair.

By this time &s;everal of the Family were rai&s;ed, and &s;ome running where the Noi&s;e was heard (for the Lady and <HI>Philenis</HI> both call'd out as loud as they could) found them in great di&s;order, complaining of a &s;trange Apparition, which had put them into a terrible Fright; they went to pull up <HI>Cornelius,</HI> but he holding the Cloaths fa&s;t about him, cryed, good De|vil let me alone, do not take me, take my Lady.

<P>This Adventure of <HI>Nicerotis</HI> (as we be|fore hinted) was only a Fiction, invented by the witty Malice of a certain Per&s;on, that had prov'd un&s;ucce&s;sful in attempting that Kindne&s;s from her, whereof he thought &s;ome others were po&s;&s;e&s;t.

<P>In the mean while <HI>Nicias</HI> was &s;o well recovered of his Wounds, that he had been abroad, and more than once made Vi&s;its to his Friend <HI>Ari&s;tander.</HI> The Intimacy be|tween them was &s;o great, that their being together, though never &s;o frequently, cou'd &s;eem no wonder; yet <HI>Nicias,</HI> in his latter Conferences, expre&s;t more Importunacy of Affection, than had been ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Ari|&s;tander</HI> in his former Friend&s;hip.

<P>One Afternoon, in the freedom of Di&s;|cour&s;e, among&s;t other Arguments, they &s;pent &s;ome Talk on the Nature and Effects of Love; which of all Pa&s;&s;ions, had this Qua|lity particular to it &s;elf, that it was of no
<PB N="69" REF="39"> le&s;s difficulty to create it where it was not, than to extingui&s;h it where it had once ta|ken fire. Several Tragical In&s;tances of the former were repeated by <HI>Eubea;</HI> in the Conclu&s;ion whereof, <HI>Nicerotis</HI> bur&s;ting forth into Tears, cries out, Let the Misfortunes of Antiquity &s;leep in &s;ilence; our own Age a|bounds too much with &s;ad Examples of this nature, and among&s;t them all none more wretched than <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> I know not (&s;aid &s;he) whether the Privation of Happine&s;s, ought really to be accounted mi&s;ery, but what &s;hall we &s;ay, when the Di&s;appoint|ment of that is attended with the mo&s;t in|&s;ufferable and incurable Evils? &s;uch, my <HI>Eu|bea,</HI> is the &s;tate of di&s;appointed Love; where the Unhappy are not only deprived of that Paradi&s;e which was pre&s;ented to their Ima|gination, and left to their primitive free|dom, but with the utmo&s;t &s;everity of for|tune, condemn'd to loath'd Embraces. It is not enough for the rendring of a Conjugal State happy, that the Per&s;on to whom we give our Vows, has all the Endowments of Art and Nature to make him amiable, unle&s;s our Brea&s;ts are di&s;engag'd from any other Pa&s;&s;ion, for that will be &s;ure to maintain the Fort again&s;t the brave&s;t A&s;&s;ailants, and in &s;pight of all Attempts that our Prudence can make, to &s;uppre&s;s the Remembrance of it,
<PB N="70" REF="40"> will often return upon us, to the Di&s;turbance of our Quiet.</P>
<P>It cannot be deny'd, that the Birth and Education, the many natural and acquired Excellencies of the Lord <HI>Nicias,</HI> were &s;uch, as wou'd have ble&s;t any Brea&s;t but mine, and that I perhaps was the only per&s;on, whom &s;o accompli&s;ht a Man cou'd have made un|happy. Take my <HI>Eubea,</HI> this Confe&s;&s;ion, for the greate&s;t In&s;tance of Friend&s;hip to your &s;elf, as it is the Argument of greate&s;t &s;orrow to me. <HI>Nicias,</HI> though de&s;tin'd for my Husband, came yet too late for a Lo|ver. My Heart had been before, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve, di&s;pos'd off to young <HI>Phi|lanthus,</HI> nor was my Conque&s;t over his, le&s;s entire. It was the fir&s;t time that either of us had been &s;en&s;ible of Love; and as fir&s;t De&s;ires are generally mo&s;t violent, I am confident that no Tran&s;ports ever equall'd ours. Be&s;ides the Advantages of his Edu|cation, and the &s;ingular Charms of his Per|&s;on, which &s;ate upon him without the lea&s;t Affectation, &s;uch was the agreeablene&s;s of his Conver&s;ation, and every way &s;o &s;uited to my Inclination, that I could not per&s;wade my &s;elf, but that we were born for each o|thers happine&s;s. It is impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the Satisfaction we took in each others Com|pany; and though our Opportunities of
<PB N="71" REF="40"> meeting were frequent, yet every parting was with &s;uch regret, that we even envy'd our &s;elves tho&s;e delightful Minutes, we were before &s;o impatient to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of. No|thing was now wanting to compleat our Joy, but the Con&s;ent of our Friends, which we had no rea&s;on to de&s;pair of; for be&s;ide the Equality of our Fortune, it had been an eternal Tye of the Amity that had long been between the two Families. And indeed the Prudence, as well as the Kindne&s;s of our Parents was herein exerted, in that they con|ceal'd as much as they cou'd, their de&s;igning a Match between us, to make it &s;eem as much as cou'd be, the effect of our own Choice and free Inclination, which was likely to have made it much more ea&s;ie to us, than if it had &s;eemed of their impo&s;ing. <HI>Philanthus</HI> was now taking re&s;olution to acquaint his Parents with his Pa&s;&s;ion, when the &s;afety of the Publick was threatned, by a mo&s;t &s;uddain and unexpected Di&s;turbance from the <HI>Sara|zens,</HI> who came with all their Naval Force to &s;urprize us in our Security, as depending upon the late Peace that was &s;olemnly con|cluded on between us. <HI>Philanthus</HI> was now of tho&s;e years, in which &s;everal of his An|ce&s;tors had &s;ignaliz'd their Courage; a|mong&s;t whom, none was ever ab&s;ent from the Service of his Country in any publick
<PB N="72" REF="41"> Action; nor could he be prevail'd with, to degenerate from their Example on this occa|&s;ion. To which, notwith&s;tanding all the Cautions that a tender Mi&s;tre&s;s cou'd repeat to a Lover, whom Youth and Ambition might betray to utmo&s;t danger, I parted from him with all the Violence of a Prophe|tick Sorrow, while he was po&s;&s;e&s;t with no le&s;s confidence of Succe&s;s. Our Re&s;idence was on the Borders of the Sea, and the En|gagement of the Fleets not many Leagues from the Coa&s;t. The Di&s;pute continued for almo&s;t three days, two whereof were con|&s;um'd by me, in watching from the Clifts, where he and I had been wont to view the Sea, and enjoy the Calmne&s;s of the Ev'nings. On the third Morning, I cou'd perceive the Fleets make further and further off to Sea, by which I knew our Ships had the <HI>Sara|zens</HI> upon the Chace. This was the fir&s;t time I could endure to withdraw my Eyes from them, when ca&s;ting them down to the Foot of the Rock, I was &s;aluted with the mo&s;t lamentable Object that ever wretched Maid beheld; the Body of my Lover brought in a Boat to the Shore. Think my <HI>Eubea,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible, what Agonies that Spectacle mu&s;t have &s;truck me with, and what Effects it was likely to produce. Spare, &s;pare me the Remembrance of tho&s;e &s;orrowful Hours
<PB N="73" REF="41"> that en&s;u'd, and the mournful Reflections of my De&s;pair, upon the happy Minutes we had pa&s;s'd together; the thou&s;and endearing Words with which he u&s;ed to charm my Soul into his Brea&s;t; which now, all for&s;aken and di&s;con&s;olate, I in vain repeated to the Rocks and Shades, where we were wont to conver&s;e. It was no wonder, if now I grew indifferent, which way I was di&s;po&s;ed on for the future, and unconcern'd, to who&s;e &s;hare this little Beauty fell, when <HI>Philanthus</HI> was cut off from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it. It was at this time, that <HI>Nicias</HI> made his Application, and pre&s;t for Marriage with me, which I &s;ub|mitted to, being tired with the Importuni|ty of my Parents, who pre&s;um'd it the be&s;t expedient that could be, to bring forget|fulne&s;s of what had happen'd. I am con|fident, that <HI>Nicias,</HI> his Pa&s;&s;ion for me, was for a long time what he pretended, and ac|cordingly I apply'd my &s;elf to make him all po&s;&s;ible Returns of Duty, which even the Eyes of Jealou&s;ie and Envy cou'd never di|&s;tingui&s;h from the &s;incerity of Affection, which in time became indeed advanc'd to that degree of Kindne&s;s, that few Wives are po&s;&s;e&s;t with, for the Hu&s;bands of their own choo&s;ing. It was at this un&s;ea&s;onable time that <HI>Nicias</HI> began to take a Surfeit of his Happine&s;s, when indeed, I ought to have
<PB N="74" REF="42"> been more dear to him than ever; but &s;uch is the Choice or Fate of Mankind, to pur|&s;ue with eagerne&s;s tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings that &s;hun them, and to fly from them that pur&s;ue. I could perceive by many In&s;tances, the cold|ne&s;s and indifferency of his Carriage towards me, nor was it long, before I under&s;tood that <HI>Thala&s;&s;a's</HI> Charms had occa&s;ion'd this Change; and if any thing could have been an excu&s;e for broken Faith, her extraordinary Beauty would even have ju&s;tified the Fal&s;|hood. He took all po&s;&s;ible occa&s;ions of making her acquainted with his Pa&s;&s;ion, and at la&s;t became &s;o importunate with her, that in her own Defence (being a Lady of &s;trict Virtue) &s;he was forc'd to acquaint me <HI>Nicias</HI> his Addre&s;&s;es to her, and askt my Di|rections, what cour&s;e to take for my Intere&s;t, and her own Quiet. Notwith&s;tanding my In|dignation at the hearing of this, I returned her my thanks, and told her, that to com|pleat the Obligation, &s;he mu&s;t feign a Com|pliance with <HI>Nicias,</HI> when he next came to &s;ollicite her, and to make him an Appoint|ment at &s;uch time and Place, that I might, unknown to him, &s;upply her Room. This was &s;everal times performed by the di&s;|gui&s;ing of my Voice, and the Darkne&s;s of the Apartments. With what Tran&s;port did he meet tho&s;e Embraces, for which he
<PB N="75" REF="42"> &s;hew'd &s;o much Indifference at home? Di|vine <HI>Thala&s;&s;a,</HI> &s;aid he, I was never acquain|ted with Bli&s;s till this Minute; dull mi&s;taken <HI>Nicias,</HI> that cou'd ever imagine that he ta&s;ted Delight in the Arms of <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> I was before &s;carce able to contain with Rage, and now with Laughter. At our parting he immediately went towards home, yet not &s;o &s;oon but that I made a &s;hift to reach the Hou&s;e, and be&s;tow my &s;elf on a Couch, be|fore he arriv'd at his entring of the Cham|ber. You mu&s;t imagine (continued &s;he) what Sentiments this Di&s;covery po&s;&s;e&s;t me with, and my unea&s;ine&s;s was the greater, be|cau&s;e I had as yet re&s;erved the Trouble within my own Thoughts, nor &s;o much as once in expre&s;s Words, let <HI>Nicias</HI> under|&s;tand, that I was &s;en&s;ible of his Fal&s;hood; it is therefore no wonder, if at this time, my Friends ob&s;erv'd in me an unu&s;ual Re|&s;ervedne&s;s and Melancholy. All this Rela|tion was delivered by <HI>Nicerotis</HI> with &s;o much tenderne&s;s, that <HI>Eubea</HI> was extreamly toucht, having a Heart and Temper apt for all tho&s;e Impre&s;&s;ions that are felt in a Pa&s;&s;io|nate Friend&s;hip, which &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;t in the highe&s;t degree for <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> However, &s;he thought that condoling with her on this Argument, might only give her a greater &s;en&s;e of her Misfortune; &s;he therefore judg|ed
<PB N="76" REF="43"> it more prudent to pacifie her what &s;he cou'd, and above all things coun&s;elled her, to &s;uffer nothing to be occa&s;ion of breach between her Husband and her. And in|deed, &s;uch was the &s;ingular goodne&s;s of her Temper, that &s;he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> a con&s;tant Reconci|ler, when any Diff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rence happen'd between them. Being therefore po&s;&s;e&s;t with &s;o great a Kindne&s;s for <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> and &s;o high an O|pinion of her Virtue, it is not to be won|dered at, that &s;he had not the lea&s;t Jealou|&s;ie of the Inclination &s;he had entertained for <HI>Ari&s;tander,</HI> and of which he was now &s;en|&s;ible by &s;everal In&s;tances. It was impo&s;&s;i|ble for the &s;tricte&s;t Virtue to be in&s;en&s;ible of <HI>Nicerotis</HI> Charms; yet there were &s;o many complicated Rea&s;ons again&s;t his indulging any &s;uch Thought (and chiefly, his Friend|&s;hip with <HI>Nicias</HI>) that he was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue no Advantage that might offer it &s;elf, but to &s;hun all Occa&s;ions that might lead thereunto. <HI>Nicias</HI> (as was before hinted) had in later Conferences with him, expre&s;&s;ed more importunate Friend&s;hip than formerly, as it were, to prepare for con&s;i|derable Tru&s;t that he intended to repo&s;e in him, though as yet he had not expre&s;ly communicated it to him. However, he was &s;o far proceeded in it, that he had already engaged <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> in the whole care of his
<PB N="77" REF="43"> Affairs, which he at fir&s;t &s;crupled, not as being an act of Friend&s;hip, and for &s;everal &s;pecious Rea&s;ons which <HI>Nicias</HI> gave him for &s;o doing: Yet finding after a little Experi|ence, that it might mini&s;ter opportunities of any Amour with <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> or occa&s;ion any Difference between him&s;elf and <HI>Eubea,</HI> he wholly declined the Management of <HI>Ni|cias</HI> his Concerns, on Pretences plau&s;ible enough, without informing him of the true Cau&s;e. This Ce&s;&s;ation notwith&s;tand|ing was but of &s;hort continuance; for <HI>Ni|cias</HI> his ill Adventures in the Duel, together with private Di&s;contents, and other Misfor|tunes, reduced him to &s;uch Indi&s;po&s;ition of Body, that to recover his Health, it was ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to leave that Country, and remove to a more agreeable Climate. So that now in the height of <HI>A|ri&s;tanders</HI> &s;atisfaction, which he took in hav|ing &s;o hand&s;omely di&s;engaged him&s;elf from the Management of his Friends Concerns, without di&s;obliging him in the refu&s;al, whereby he thought him&s;elf free from all occa&s;ion and temptation towards any In|trigue with <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> which for the Rea&s;ons we have expre&s;t, he was re&s;olved to de|cline; at the very time (I &s;ay) that he was mo&s;t plea&s;ing him&s;elf with the&s;e Reflections, he was unexpectedly acquainted with the
<PB N="78" REF="44"> News of <HI>Nicias</HI>'s &s;udden departure from that Place, and could by no means believe it, till he was confirmed of it by this Let|ter, directed to him&s;elf.</P>

<P>MY Departure to another Countrey, with|out any Leave taken of &s;o dear a Friend as <HI>Ari&s;tander,</HI> mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s him with no little Surprize; But by all the &s;incerity of our Friend&s;hip, I conjure you not to im|pute that to &V;nkindne&s;s, which is the Re|&s;ult of Di&s;content: I leave your &s;elf to judge how afflicting that trouble mu&s;t be, which I would make any &s;cruple of commu|nicating to <HI>Ari&s;tander.</HI> The Griefs with which I labour, would extort Pity from an Enemy; what influence then would they have upon you? no, my Friend, I will be more tender of your Quiet, then to wound you with the Knowledge of them; and thus far acquaint you with them, only to engage you to the performance of what I have to re|que&s;t.

<PB N="79" REF="44">
<P><HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> read over the&s;e Lines &s;everal times, and &s;till found him&s;elf more and more a&s;toni&s;ht with the Contents. The Di&s;order in the Expre&s;&s;ion, and the matter they con|tain'd, &s;ufficiently confirm'd him, how great Trouble and Difficulty his Friend labour'd under, at the writing of them, and was not a little afflicted, that he was in no po&s;&s;ibili|ty (by rea&s;on of his Ab&s;ence) of admi|ni&s;tring &s;uch Coun&s;el or Relief, as his Kind|ne&s;s might in&s;pire him with, on &s;uch an Oc|ca&s;ion. But having &s;ufficiently condoled within him&s;elf the Mi&s;eries with which <HI>Ni|cias</HI> was oppre&s;t, he perceiv'd him&s;elf again inevitably involv'd in the Management of his Concerns, and con&s;equently the &s;ame Inconveniencies and Apprehen&s;ions return'd upon him, for which he &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly de|clin'd that Office before. His doubts and perplexity hereupon were &s;o great, that his Unea&s;ine&s;s was pre&s;ently ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Eubea,</HI> who extreamly pre&s;t him to di&s;cover the Cau&s;e. All the Account that he gave her, was his Sorrow for his Friends &s;o &s;udden Removal, and the Un&s;etled Po&s;ture in which he had left his Affairs. I condole (reply'd <HI>Eubea</HI>) as much as po&s;&s;ibly you can do, any Misfortune of the Lord <HI>Nicias,</HI> o|therwi&s;e I &s;hould very ill de&s;erve that Degree of Friend&s;hip, which I am favour'd with by
<PB N="80" REF="45"> <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> The &s;malle&s;t Concern of his, whil&s;t out of his own Power ought to be of great importance to you, but e&s;pe|cially his deare&s;t part, the de&s;titute <HI>Nicero|tis,</HI> mu&s;t be your principal Care. Let me therefore conjure you, as I have any &s;hare in your Affection, to contribute all that po&s;&s;ibly you can to the diverting of her Grief, and making her Trouble &s;it ea&s;ie up|on her. The&s;e Arguments, and whatever el&s;e could po&s;&s;ibly be in&s;i&s;ted on by <HI>Eubea,</HI> in behalf of her Friend <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> were urged by her with all the earne&s;tne&s;s that could be. <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> notwith&s;tanding made her no &s;udden An&s;wer, being wholly taken up with contemplation on this Adventure, and yet could not but &s;mile &s;ecretly at <HI>Eu|bea's</HI> pre&s;&s;ing Sollicitation, being con&s;cious to him&s;elf, that his Aver&s;ion to engage in <HI>Nicerotis</HI> Affairs, was not out of any want of kindne&s;s to her, but meerly a Principle of ju&s;tice, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially towards <HI>Eu|bea.</HI> He was now &s;en&s;ible by many in&s;tan|ces, that an Addre&s;s from him to <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> was likely to meet with &s;mall Oppo&s;ition; nor was he willing to venture on &s;uch Op|portunities of making Advances that way, as the whole Management of her Concerns mu&s;t needs offer to him.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="45">
<P>And though an Attempt of that kind might &s;eem incon&s;i&s;tent with a generous Nature in any Circum&s;tances, yet the pre|&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s which his Friend lay under, and the Confidence he had repo&s;ed in him at this time, made every thought that might have a tendency that way, with the utmo&s;t Re&s;olution rejected by him. However, <HI>Eubea</HI> was &s;o re&s;tle&s;s in her Entreaties, and the di&s;con&s;olate Condition of his Friend were &s;o prevailing, that he could not but comply with his De&s;ire, in e&s;pou&s;ing intirely the Care of his Wife and Fortunes, and by this means, to be under nece&s;&s;ity of frequent Conver&s;ation with <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> She was not di&s;plea&s;ed herewith, nor was it le&s;s to the &s;atisfacti|on of <HI>Eubea,</HI> who was never better con|tented, than when <HI>Nicerotis</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tan|der</HI> were in Company with each other.</P>
<P>Some con&s;iderable time pa&s;&s;ed over in this manner, while <HI>Ari&s;tander,</HI> with all the &s;incerity of a faithful Friend, and with much indu&s;try, performed the Charge that was left upon him. <HI>Eubea</HI> continu|ing &s;till without the lea&s;t Jealou&s;ie, and infinitely plea&s;ed, to find the Tru&s;t re|po&s;ed in her Husband, di&s;charged with &s;o much advantage to <HI>Nicerotis. Nicias,</HI> in the mean time, after much weakne&s;s, and
<PB N="82" REF="46"> increa&s;e of his Indi&s;po&s;ition, was at la&s;t recovered to that &s;eeming degree of health, as to think of adventuring back again to his own Country, where he found, upon all Accounts, the good effects of his Friends careful Management; nor was <HI>Ari|&s;tander</HI> le&s;s plea&s;ed at having had oppor|tunity of being &s;erviceable to him at a time of di&s;tre&s;s: but withal, for the Con|&s;iderations we have expre&s;t, was well e|nough contented to be di&s;engaged from his Imployment, and to re&s;ign his Office into <HI>Nicias</HI> his own Hands. <HI>Nicias</HI> could not but accept of the Surrender, being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">ing now in a Condition to excu&s;e his F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">nd from the trouble; yet <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> perceived a &s;ecret reluctancy in him, on the removal of his Affairs out of his hands, and &s;eemed inclinable, that not only his Fortunes but his Wife &s;hould &s;till be under <HI>Aristanders</HI> Care. Howe|ver, not being very expre&s;s therein at that time, <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> once more, thought him&s;elf totally exempted from that Office, and from danger or inconvenience that might occur thereby. This Re&s;pite again was but of &s;hort Continuance, for <HI>Nicias</HI> relap&s;ing into a wor&s;e Condition than e|ver, once more entreats his Friends Go|vernment and Conduct in his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="83" REF="46"> which was accepted as formerly by <HI>Ari|&s;tander.</HI> After this re-engagement, <HI>Nicias</HI> &s;eemed every day increa&s;e in his Endear|ments and Amity towards his Friend; but &s;till labouring with &s;ome &s;ecret, which he was re&s;tle&s;s to communicate unto him. One Evening, being &s;omething more than ordinary refre&s;ht in his Spirits, when none were pre&s;ent be&s;ides his Wife and <HI>Ari|&s;tander,</HI> after &s;ilence for &s;ome minutes, with a Smile, he uttered the&s;e Words. The Love (&s;aid he) of Parents to their own Off-&s;pring is the practice of all the World, and has been &s;o in all Ages; yet I can|not but reflect with &s;ome wonder, how a Cu&s;tom &s;hould prevail &s;o upon all man|kind, without any one rational Cau&s;e to enforce it. The oddne&s;s of this A&s;&s;ertion, and the abrupt manner of his introducing it, put <HI>Nicerotis</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> into a pau&s;e, till <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> made this Reply. It &s;hould (&s;aid he) rather be a Wonder (as the greate&s;t Crime again&s;t nature and de|viation from common &s;en&s;e) to find that Parent, that were void of Love towards his own I&s;&s;ue. I grant you (proceeded <HI>Nicias</HI>) that a De&s;cent of kindne&s;s to po|&s;terity is mo&s;t natural; but from whence that Di&s;tinction &s;hould proceed, the great difference of Affection between the Off-&s;pring
<PB N="84" REF="47"> of our own Bodies, and other mens, e&s;pecially of Kindred and Friends, is to me, altogether unaccountable; for it is plain (continued he) that it is not the per&s;onal Merit, the intrin&s;ick Virtues and Qualifications which our Children may happen to be endowed with, that engages our Love towards them; for we often find them far excelled upon the&s;e accounts, by the Off-&s;pring of others, for whom, yet we are po&s;&s;e&s;t with no &s;uch fondne&s;s, and what other Con&s;ideration &s;hould lead a rea&s;onable man to &s;uch partiality, is pa&s;t my under&s;tanding. You will not certainly (&s;aid <HI>Nicerotis</HI>) di&s;pute the Prudence of a Practice which nature (that is the &s;upream eternal Rea&s;on) in|&s;pires; be&s;ides, if it were not the Effect of an In&s;tinct that reigns through the whole Creation, yet what can be more agreea|ble to common Equity, than for Parents to have particular care and indulgence for tho&s;e Per&s;ons, of who&s;e Beings (next to Providence) they were the immediate Authors&punc; To &s;ay nothing of the&s;e duti|ful Retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> which ought, and for the mo&s;t p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rt are paid by Children to them a|gain, there is yet methinks (replies <HI>Ni|cias</HI>) a poorne&s;s of Spirit, and &s;omething of a &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">id &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, in fondne&s;s of our
<PB N="85" REF="47"> own Products, more than tho&s;e of a Friend. It is evidently the nature of friend&s;hip, in perfection, to hold our friend in equal value with our &s;elves, nay, even to &s;ubmit our own Intere&s;t and De|&s;ires to his; if therefore my Friend appear to me of &s;uch merit, as to claim Affecti|on from me, equal to what I have for my &s;elf, I know not why I &s;hould not be as fond of his Likene&s;s as my own. Why &s;hould not the &s;ame rea&s;oning hold in the Copy, as in the Original? And why the Son of that Per&s;on whom I hold dearer than my &s;elf, &s;hould not be dearer to me, than one that &s;prung from my &s;elf, I cannot comprehend? and that my Friend&s;hip for <HI>Ari&s;tander,</HI> is elevated to that Degree I mu&s;t needs acknowledge. The&s;e la&s;t Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Nicias,</HI> put <HI>A|ri&s;tander</HI> and <HI>Nicerotis</HI> to the Blu&s;h, who knew not how to reply on this occa&s;ion; for they could not take notice of the Con&s;equence that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow, from what <HI>Nicias</HI> had &s;aid. He plainly expre&s;t it his judgment, that the Child of a Friend, &s;hould be dearer to him than his own, and that <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> was that Friend, and they were al&s;o &s;en&s;ible, that towards &s;uch a Birth, he included his own Wife. The Right of a Hu&s;band (proceeded he) in
<PB N="86" REF="48"> his own Wife, is indi&s;putable, and certain|ly, it is the foule&s;t Violation of Ju&s;tice, to invade any man in that Tenure; but Con&s;ent removes all notion of Injury, and to &s;ay that a Man has not di&s;po&s;al of that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as he &s;hall think fit, is to &s;ay, he has le&s;s Right in his Wife, than in his meane&s;t Chattels; if therefore a Hu&s;band, by any Misfortune or Irregula|rity, &s;hould think him&s;elf uncapable of Off-&s;pring in his own Per&s;on, I know not why the Wife &s;hould therefore be de|frauded from the comfort of Children. Therefore in &s;uch Circum&s;tances (e&s;pecial|ly where the having an Heir is requi&s;ite) if by Con&s;ent, the Friend &s;upplies the Of|fice of the Hu&s;band, it is &s;o far from be|ing an Injury, that it mu&s;t be e&s;teemed an Obligation. The&s;e Arguments were delivered by <HI>Nicias,</HI> with &s;o firm a Coun|tenance, and &s;uch an earne&s;tne&s;s in his Eyes, as plainly di&s;covered his Intention by this Di&s;cour&s;e, and that he de&s;ired his Wife and <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> to take it, with particular application to them&s;elves; and that the breaking this De&s;ign to them, was the Difficulty that had &s;o long made him unea&s;ie, and towards which, he had &s;o often made imperfect Attempts. Hav|ing therefore after this manner expre&s;t
<PB N="87" REF="48"> him&s;elf (fixing his Looks mo&s;t eagerly up|on them) he &s;ate expecting their Reply. But &s;till, the more plainly that his Drift was under&s;tood, the greater the Confu&s;ion appeared in them.</P>
<P><HI>Nicerotis</HI> was far from an Aver&s;ion to <HI>Ari&s;tander,</HI> and &s;he was by her Con&s;tituti|on, no Enemy to Variety (be&s;ides her be|ing de&s;irous enough of Children, and in no probability of having any by <HI>Nicias</HI>) yet, whether &s;he thought that this Propo&s;al of her Hu&s;bands, &s;avoured &s;omething of Neglect towards her, though under pre|tence of Ju&s;tice to her, or whether &s;he thought her &s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">bliged in Mode&s;ty to re|&s;ent (at lea&s;t in appearance) &s;o unexpect|ed a Charge, there was thereupon, a great Change of Colour, and Combat of Pa&s;&s;i|ons in her Face. <HI>Aristander</HI> laboured with no le&s;s difficulty; for all the plau&s;ible Rea&s;ons that <HI>Nicias</HI> alledged, could not convince him, but that there was too much inju&s;tice in &s;uch a Practice.</P>
<P>The Conference was here broken off, by the approach of a Vi&s;itant, who was not to be denied. It was the Lady <HI>Do|riska,</HI> one that &s;corned to &s;uffer time to have his u&s;ual triumph over Per&s;ons of her years, notwith&s;tanding which, &s;he &s;till retained all the Mirth and Gaity of her
<PB N="88" REF="49"> youthful Humour. Her Inclination had always been for Company and Treats, and never &s;o well &s;atisfied as when &s;he &s;aw the Affairs of Love going forward; if &s;he could therein make her Endea|vours &s;erviceable to a Friend, it was &s;o much the more to her Content; but ra|ther than &s;ee a fair Opportunity lo&s;t, and &s;tand out, when Action offered it &s;elf, &s;he would not refu&s;e obliging a Stran|ger. In the mean time, <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> is wholly at a lo&s;s, how to behave him&s;elf in this Adventure. And after through con&s;ideration, once more re&s;olves upon wholly leaving <HI>Nicerotis</HI> Company, but is again prevented by the Sollicitations of his Wife. <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> however was re&s;olv|ed not utterly to lo&s;e the Advantage that offered it &s;elf by this freedom. She therefore perceiving this Method &s;o &s;ati&s;|factory to her Hu&s;band, contrives all Opportunities &s;he can of meeting with <HI>Ari&s;tander.</HI> Therefore as a fit Expedient herein, &s;he betakes her to <HI>Doriska</HI> for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance and direction, as it were to an Oracle, and the more, as knowing her to have &s;ome intimacy with <HI>Ari&s;tan|der.</HI> The Matron return'd her many Complements, for the Opinion &s;he expre&s;t of her Judgment, and the Confidence &s;he
<PB N="89" REF="49"> was plea&s;ed to repo&s;e in her readine&s;s to &s;erve her; and I hope (&s;aid &s;he) I can give a more rea&s;onable account of my time and experience, than not to be able to direct any Friend that &s;hall apply them&s;elves to me for Coun&s;el in the Pro|vince of Love. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> &s;miled to her &s;elf, and proceeded to &s;ay, it would be the mo&s;t injurious thing in the World, not to allow her Ladi&s;hip an extrordina|ry Talent in the Conduct of Amour. After this, &s;he freely imparted to her the &s;ub|&s;tance of the late Di&s;cour&s;e that pa&s;t be|tween <HI>Nicias,</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> and her &s;elf. The Matron again appeared extreamly &s;atisfied with the Matter, with many poli|tick Remarks upon it, but above all, ap|plauded the Sentiments and Re&s;olves of <HI>Nicias;</HI> and among&s;t other things (&s;aid &s;he) the wi&s;e&s;t Records of Antiquity will be found to be of his &s;ide. Let us go no farther for In&s;tance, than the Confines of our own Country of <HI>Greece;</HI> what Com|mon-wealth can boa&s;t of a Continuance like that of <HI>Lacedaemon?</HI> and what could pro|duce &s;uch duration, but the prudence and po|licy of tho&s;e &s;anctions that were in|&s;tituted by the wi&s;e <HI>Lycurgus?</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plutarch <HI>in</HI> Vit&acirc; Ly|curgi.</NOTE> a|mong&s;t which, I will be bold to affirm the great Latitude permit|ted
<PB N="90" REF="50" MS="y"> to Wives in extraordinary Ca&s;es, to have been of mo&s;t important Advantage, where the Per&s;on &s;ub&s;tituted to him that was incapacitated, was not only reputed to perform a Kindne&s;s to his Friend, but likewi&s;e a mo&s;t laudable Service to the State.</P>
<P>This learned Di&s;cour&s;e of the old Lad|dies, and the Zeal with which &s;he ex|pre&s;t her &s;elf, gave no &s;mall Diver&s;ion to <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> Nor &s;he think bare Coun&s;el &s;ufficient, for one that pretended friend|&s;hip, without &s;hewing her &s;elf active too in her Service. She therefore &s;o con|trived Matters, that <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> was by her means, often brought into her Com|pany; but being at length &s;en&s;ible that it was all to no effect, &s;he reflected with &s;ome indignation, to have her Labours defeated, and however took re&s;olution within her &s;elf, not to &s;ee &s;o fair an opportunity utterly lo&s;t. She knew there wanted not Lovers that would think them&s;elves happy in &s;uch Advanta|ges, and therefore ca&s;t about to be&s;tow her Endeavours, where the Benefit might be received with gratitude. In the mean time, the Vi&s;its that &s;he made and receiv|ed from <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> were very frequent. She was &s;o far from being pa&s;t the Re|li&s;h
<PB N="91" REF="50"> of youthful Diver&s;ions and Enter|tainments of Mirth, that &s;he was fre|quently the Life of the Company; and where-ever &s;he was pre&s;ent, triumpht over Melancholy, both in her &s;elf and others. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tander,</HI> had always found a great agreeablene&s;s in each others Com|pany, and the perplexity of her Affairs, had often made it nece&s;&s;ary. Yet as much as they delighted in retired Conver&s;ati|on together, <HI>Doriska</HI> &s;till brought &s;o much ea&s;ine&s;s and good humour along with her, that her coming was &s;eldom unwelcome; and if the Nicety of his Friend&s;hip could have di&s;pen&s;ed with what was propo&s;ed, it would have been extreamly to her Content; but finding &s;till that a harm|le&s;s Corre&s;pondence was the utmo&s;t of his De&s;ign, &s;he thought &s;uch poor Advances un|worthy a Patrone&s;s of her Politicks, and &s;o giving him wholly over, looks out for a new Adventurer.</P>
<P>And it &s;o fell out at this time, that a young Spark that was her Kin&s;man, had entertained no &s;mall Pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Nicero|tis,</HI> and (having ob&s;erved the intimacy be|tween them) was encouraged to apply him&s;elf to his Kin&s;woman for her A&s;|&s;i&s;tance. The Propo&s;al was readily enough embraced by her, who engaged in a &s;hort
<PB N="92" REF="51"> time to bring his De&s;ires to effect, or forfeit her Conduct in Affairs of Love for ever. The young Gentleman was ex|treamly tran&s;ported with her An&s;wer, and whatever Difficulties he might apprehend, he had good confidence in &s;o skilful a Guide. She therefore immediately be&s;tirs her in his behalf, with &s;o much Craft and good Management, that (as Circum&s;tances &s;tood) &s;he would not have fail'd of &s;uc|ce&s;s with a Lady of more re&s;ervedne&s;s than <HI>Nicerotis.</HI> The Bu&s;ine&s;s in &s;hort was &s;o well agreed among&s;t them, that he is kindly received, and almo&s;t continually in private with her, <HI>Aristander</HI> in the mean time, appearing in publick, both as her Friend to her Husband, and her Protector. It mu&s;t be imagined, that he &s;oon found it very unea&s;ie for him, to be Patron to the&s;e Practices, yet was uncertain what cour&s;e to take, being cordially a Friend to <HI>Nicerotis,</HI> and unwilling to do any thing that might prove prejudicial to her Reputation. But there appearing no like|lyhood of Di&s;countenance of this Intrigue, he could not longer bear to have his Pro|tection made a Property, and thereupon di&s;covers the whole truth of the Matter to his Wife <HI>Eubea,</HI> informing her withal, that it was requi&s;ite for her to break off
<PB N="93" REF="51"> her Acquaintance with <HI>Nicerotis. Eubea</HI> was very difficult at fir&s;t, to believe any thing to the Prejudice of her Friends Re|putation, yet being at length convinc'd thereof, &s;he judged it altogether nece&s;&s;ary to cea&s;e from conver&s;ing with her. She made choice by way of Letter to acquaint her with her Re&s;olution, and that in the milde&s;t Terms &s;he could expre&s;s her &s;elf. <HI>Nicerotis</HI> however fell into all the Violence of Pa&s;&s;ion at the Peru&s;al, yet as &s;he wanted not tenderne&s;s of Temper and Art of Expre&s;|&s;ion, &s;he &s;ent her this Reply.</P>

The Thoughts of lo&s;ing your Friend&s;hip for e|ver, &s;trikes me with un&s;peakable &s;urprize, yet my happine&s;s in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, was &s;o great, that I might without Prophecy, long &s;ince have concluded it was not always to be en|joyed; but this is not the only ill Treat|ment I have received at Fortunes hands, and <HI>Eubea</HI> well knows, that it is not the fir&s;t, though the greate&s;t Affliction of</P>

<PB N="94" REF="52">
<P><HI>Eubea</HI> read over the&s;e Lines with Tears, and &s;ummoned all her good Nature in her Excu&s;e, and particularly reflected on the Relation &s;he had formerly given, of her un|happy Di&s;appointment in her fir&s;t Love, and imputed altogether to that Misfortune, any frailty that &s;he might afterwards fall into. <HI>Ari&s;tander</HI> in the mean time was no le&s;s afflicted, his Kindne&s;s for <HI>Nicerotis</HI> was &s;o great, that it was as much as he could do to contain it within the Bounds of Friend&s;hip; he was not in&s;en&s;ible of her Beauty, and he always thought the plea&s;ure he po&s;&s;e&s;t in her Conver&s;ation, a &s;ufficient Recompence for any Toil or Dif|ficulty in the Management of her Affairs. So that his Unea&s;ine&s;s and Melancholy for being deprived of her Company, was al|together as great, as if he had indulged him&s;elf in all the freedom of a Lover, and perhaps the innocent manner of their conver&s;ing together (as it was more re|fin'd and generous) &s;o it gave &s;omething of delight and endearment beyond the gro&s;&s;er &s;en&s;e. He &s;eemed wholly at a lo&s;s within him&s;elf, and with many a Sigh vi&s;it|ed the Walks, that had &s;o often been the plea&s;ant Scenes of their Di&s;cour&s;e. On the other &s;ide, the Di&s;content and Grief where|with <HI>Nicerotis</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;t, proved of longer
<PB N="95" REF="52"> continuance than could be expected from a Per&s;on of her airy humour, and it was as much as all <HI>Doriska's</HI> Art and Gaity could do, to bring her to any tolerable Quiet.</P>
