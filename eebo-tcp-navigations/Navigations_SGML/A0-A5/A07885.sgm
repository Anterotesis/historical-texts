<HEAD>The pitifull de&s;truction of the <HI>Towne of</HI> Mulheim <HI>extracted out of</HI> certaine letters bearing date in <HI>Cullen the fir&s;t of October in the euening.</HI> 1615.</HEAD>
<P>_VPon the nine and twenty day of September la&s;t pa&s;t, there was an extraordinary Coun|cell and &s;ecret meeting hol|den in the city of Cullen: which done, in the afternoone, it being S. <HI>Michaels</HI> day, (which is to be noted) all the Ma&s;ons, Bricklayers, Carpenters and Sla|ters, were called and a&s;&s;embled together, before the Magi&s;trates, by whom they were told and willed to make them &s;elues ready, with pickaxes, &s;houels, and other tooles, the night en&s;uing about three of the clocke in the morning, therewith vtterly to raze and breake downe the towne of Muhleim, vpon paine of being put from their trades of liuing, if they refu&s;ed &s;o to doe. This vnexpected warnjng put the workemen in|to no little feare, and perplexity, &s;o that at
<PB REF="3">the fir&s;t they vtterly refu&s;ed and denied to doe it, &s;aying that it behoued them to &s;et better &s;oldiers a worke, in that peece of &s;er|uice, then they were, alledging that they feared and greatly doubted that the &s;tones thereof might and would then, or in time to come, breake their, or their childrens Shins: wherevnto the Magi&s;trates made an&s;were that they would be their warrant and protectors again&s;t all men for doing it. Wherevpon the worke men fully re&s;olued, that if the Burgo-Ma&s;ter and the Magi|&s;trates of the city, would goe before them &amp; be their guides, they would follow them: which they promi&s;ed to doe. While this matter was in determination, the gates of the city were kept &s;hut, that no man in the meane time &s;hould goe out, to make report thereof abroad, and that the townes men of Mulheim might not haue intelligence of their pretence, to &s;aue them &s;elues by flight. At the &s;ame time there was a rumor &s;pread abroad, that in the new market place, in the city of Cullen, there was a murther com|mitted,
<PB REF="3">and that &s;earch was then to be made for the murtherer: vnder this prete~ce in the night time, about 3. of the clock, which was the pretended time and houre appointed: <HI>Iohn Bowlant</HI> the Burgerma&s;ter, and others of the Magi&s;trates, went out of the gates; with &s;uch a number of cre&s;&s;ets, fackles, linkes, and lanternes, that the night &s;eemed to be as light as day, and after them the towns men followed to the number of 800. at the lea&s;t, be&s;ides &s;traglers, hauing 200. &s;oldiers, with pipes and drums, marching before them, to defend the worke men: be|fore they fell to worke, there was a com|mi&s;&s;ion red vnto them to &s;hew and certifie them, that it was not onely the Emperors and the Dukes plea&s;ure, to haue it done, but al&s;o the new-Burgers and the Magi|&s;trates of Cullens will, who had &s;ought and procured the &s;ame, for the good &amp; welfare of the city of Cullen, &amp; the pre&s;eruation of the citizens thereof: which done they fell to worke, fir&s;t breaking downe the greate&s;t hou&s;es, and &s;o continued the &s;poyle the
<PB REF="4">whole night, and all the next day vntill the fir&s;t of October in the euening, whereby not a &s;tone therof is left &s;tanding one vpon the other. The bricks, free &s;tones, lead, and iron, and that which would &s;erue for any thing, was giuen vnto the Capucins, and al the ruines of the great Church. The French Church, with all the ruines thereof, was gi|uen to the Fulldoers, which they them|&s;elues brake downe. The great deep cellers and vaults, which could not well be broken in ha&s;t, they tooke order that they &s;hould be blowne vp with gunpouder, and that then the new hou&s;es that had bin built in old Mulheim within the &s;pace of foure yeares, &s;hould be throwne downe. No man therein had any warning giuen him of the de&s;truction thereof, nor any time permit|ted them to &s;cape away: al the women (were they neuer &s;o great with childe, or lying in childe bed) children, and men, were &s;traight|ly charged and forbidden not to goe into Cologne, &s;o that no man knowes whether they fled to &s;aue them &s;elues, for that, all
<PB REF="4">thereabouts in &s;ome pe&s;ants hou&s;es, and al|&s;o in old Mulheim there lay many Wal|lons, that had more de&s;ire to &s;poile and de|&s;troy the poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people running away, then to &s;aue and harbor them. This heauy and &s;orrowfull night, ray&s;ed a great cry, pitifull noy&s;e, woe and clamor in the towne of Mulheim, &s;pecially among poore women and children, for that mo&s;t part of the Merchants of the Towne were then at Fanckfort Mart, and tho&s;e that dealt in wines, were gone vp into the country, to buy wine. To conclude, in this vnexpe|cted and cruell action, all the fauour &s;how|ed them was, that they murthered not the poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed men, who&s;e wofull cries clime vp and pierce into heauen, and make complaint vnto the great reuenger of all iniuries, and oppre&s;&s;ed people, that with deuout prayer re|commend them&s;elues vnto him.</P>
