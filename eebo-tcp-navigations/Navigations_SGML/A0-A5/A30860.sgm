<P>HEre are the Travels of our <HI>Italian Gentleman,</HI> that you have &s;o long de&s;ired to peru&s;e in our Language.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE COUNTRY OF Precious John, Vulgarly called <HI>PRESTER JOHN.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Empire of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> is not inferiour to the lar|ge&s;t in the World, if we con&s;ider that va&s;t Continent that
<PB N="2" REF="125">
was anciently, and &s;hould be now under the Command of the law|ful Heir. It contained above thir|ty large Kingdoms, and many fruitful Provinces well furni&s;hed with Men, and &s;tored with Rich Commodities; but the late un|happy Wars with the Neighbour Kings have much weakned this growing Empire, and reduced it to a little number.</P>
<P>The Turks, the <HI>Gialas,</HI> the King of <HI>Mozambique,</HI> the <HI>Moors,</HI> and &s;everal others that &s;urround this Chri&s;tian Principality, have di&s;-membred the Provinces and Kingdoms that were anciently &s;ubject to it, and &s;ubmitted them to their &s;everal Jurisdictions. The <HI>Moors</HI> have &s;eized on the Sea|coa&s;t, the <HI>Turks</HI> have conquer'd the mo&s;t fruitful Kingdoms that confine upon <HI>Egypt,</HI> the <HI>Gialas</HI> a war-like Re-publick of <HI>Africa,</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="125">
command &s;everal large Ter|ritories that belong unto this Imperial Crown. The King of <HI>Mozambique</HI> and the re&s;t have robbed it of its chief Jewels and Ornaments, &s;o that at pre&s;ent it is nothing &s;o large, nor &s;o con&s;idera|ble as formerly it was. The cau&s;e of the&s;e great Lo&s;&s;es mu&s;t be at|tributed to the Cowardi&s;e and unexperience of the Inhabitants more inclinable to Super&s;tition than war-like feats, and to the diver&s;ity of Religion in which the&s;e Nations differ much from the Aby&s;&s;ins. The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> are nouri&s;hed up in the Ma|humetan, the <HI>Gialas</HI> and they of <HI>Mozambique</HI> in the Heatheni&s;h I|dolatrie (which cannot comply with the Chri&s;tian Truth.) The Profe&s;&s;ors of the former, have a natural antipathy again&s;t the Pro|&s;elites of the latter; in&s;omuch,
<PB N="4" REF="126">
that they can &s;carce &s;uffer them to breath in the &s;ame air. This hatred entertained by the different ways of wor&s;hipping the Creator, hath fomented all the&s;e wars and troubles that have for many hun|dred years &s;haken the Aby&s;&s;in Empire, and &s;eparated from it the mo&s;t excellent, and the large&s;t Provinces that did belong unto it; &s;o that at pre&s;ent it is reduced to a very narrow Circuit in com|pari&s;on of what it was. The Em|perour neverthele&s;s maintains the &s;ame State as he did formerly, and claims a right to all tho&s;e King|doms that he hath lo&s;t. His pre|&s;ent Dominions are not above 800 Engli&s;h miles in length, and 600 in bredth; they contain the&s;e Kingdoms, <HI>Amara, Tigre|mahon, Angot, Xoa, G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ama, Baga|midri, Damut, Fategar, Barnagaez, Baru, Tigrai, Vangue,;</HI> &s;o that
<PB N="5" REF="126">
they are limited on the North by <HI>Nubia,</HI> and the Mountains and Sands that &s;eparate them from <HI>E|gypt;</HI> on the Ea&s;t, by the Kingdoms of <HI>Zangebara, Aiana</HI> and <HI>Adel,</HI> which lie upon the red Sea; on the South, the Provinces of <HI>Cafutes</HI> and <HI>Fungi</HI> do &s;hut it, and on the We&s;t this Empire confines upon <HI>Congo, Medra</HI> and the <HI>Blacks.</HI> This Rich and In-land Country I have di&s;covered by my Travels, and now that I am &s;o happily returned to my own Native &s;oil, after &s;o long and trouble&s;ome a Journey, I owe to my Country a Relation of tho&s;e things that I have learned, which I may &s;ay, never any knew &s;o much of this place before, as the Reader may find in this Book. In the year 1655. &s;ome Mer|chants of <HI>Florence</HI> were preparing to &s;ail for <HI>Alexandria,</HI> I re&s;olved to adventure my &s;elf in their
<PB N="6" REF="127">
Company, out of a great de&s;ire to vi&s;it the Holy-Land, and &s;ee for|rein places. I had then received &s;ome di&s;content at home, which made me &s;eek my &s;atisfaction a|broad; having therefore furni&s;h|ed my &s;elf with large &s;ums of mo|ney, and a Man Servant, I embar|qued with them in a Dutch bot|tom, and in a fortnights time we landed in that ancient City which <HI>Alexander</HI> had built. The plague was then very hot in that place, which obliged us to a &s;hort &s;tay there. Some French Merchants were then going for Grand <HI>Cairo;</HI> my company per&s;waded me to take my journey with them, and vi&s;it the curio&s;ities of that large City; I was not willing to take that Road &s;o &s;oon, for I de&s;ired fir&s;t to pay my devotions at the Sepulcher of our Lord, but the per&s;wa&s;ions of my friends forced
<PB N="7" REF="127">
me to leave that journey until my return, becau&s;e we could not find a fit opportunity to travel in|to the Holy-Land I went there|fore with the French Merchants to <HI>Catro,</HI> and &s;pent &s;ome days there in viewing all the Rari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">es of that Great City; we had a &s;ight there and in our way of many An|tiquities which are &s;o well known to all the world, that I &s;hall not &s;o much as mention them. I had not been there a month, but a <HI>Ca|ravan</HI> was preparing for the Red Sea. The French Con&s;ul, at who&s;e hou&s;e I lay, encouraged me to take that occa&s;ion of di&s;covering tho&s;e Parts where Chri&s;tians of of Quality &s;eldom adventure them&s;elves; a&s;&s;uring me, that it would be worth my while to &s;ee tho&s;e remote places, and di&s;cover &s;omething to the Chri&s;tian world, which was not known before. It
<PB N="8" REF="128">
happened that as I was medita|ting upon this journey, an <HI>Abuna</HI> or a High Prie&s;t of the Aby&s;&s;ins came to the Patriarchs hou&s;e from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in his journey to|wards <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> intending to take the &s;ame way as the <HI>Caravan,</HI> be|cau&s;e it was the &s;afe&s;t. This acci|dent I lookt upon as an invitation of providence among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>A|frican</HI> Chri&s;tians that are not well known to our Northern Climates. Having therefore furni&s;hed my &s;elf with Moneys and Bills of Ex|change for &s;o long a journey, I &s;ought the acquaintance of the <HI>Abuna</HI> before my departure. It was no difficulty to obtain, for he was learned in the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue, and well ver&s;ed in the manner and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Franks;</HI> he was a Man of a &s;warthy countenance, both plea&s;ant and grave, of a high &s;tature, about 60 years of
<PB N="9" REF="128">
age, very lu&s;ty; he had not many to attend him, for he was not wil|ling to di&s;cover him&s;elf among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> who might have made advantage of him, by obliging him to larger disbur&s;ements than his E&s;tate could allow: I was re|&s;olved to accompany him into his own Country, and vi&s;it the Court of the great <HI>Neguz</HI> &s;o famous all over the world; we therefore en|gaged our &s;elves in the <HI>Caravan.</HI> I went for an <HI>Italian</HI> pilgrim, who&s;e Per&s;on is much re&s;pected among&s;t the Heathens them&s;elves, and lea&s;t &s;ubject to the affronts and in&s;ults of &s;trangers. The <HI>A|buna</HI> was al&s;o in the di&s;gui&s;e of a Merchant, he had with him &s;ome Goods of a &s;mall value; we began our journey in the moneth of <HI>March,</HI> and through &s;everal mi&s;|fortunes we arrived at the Port Town of the Red Sea called <HI>Suez,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="129">
a famous place for Trade, it is the pa&s;&s;age into <HI>Arabia Indo&s;tan</HI> and all other Countries of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> Here are therefore a great company of Merchants of all Nations that en|rich this place, which otherwi&s;e would be very uncon&s;iderable. It is a City fortified with a Ca&s;tle and a Fort upon the mold as big as <HI>Pi&s;a.</HI> The buildings are large, fitter for Merchants than Noble|men; &s;ome are beautified with black and white Marble curiou&s;ly wrought. Here is a Synagogue of the <HI>Jews</HI> much frequented on the Sabbath day, here is al&s;o an Idol Temple for the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> but the poor Chri&s;tians have no other place appointed for their Devoti|ons, but their Chambers and Hou|&s;es. The <HI>Abuna</HI> found here &s;ome Aby&s;&s;in Merchants, at who&s;e dwellings he was courteou&s;ly re|ceived, and honouraby entertain|ed;
<PB N="11" REF="129">
they invited me to &s;hare with him in their Ho&s;pitality; I accepted their kind offer, becau&s;e I had no mind to &s;eparate my &s;elf from him, &s;eeing my de&s;ign was to accompany him as far as his Emperours Court. Here we re|mained &s;everal months, becau&s;e we heard of an Army of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> that were making an In|road into the Territories of the Aby&s;&s;ins, we were advi&s;ed to ex|pect with patience their return, for otherwi&s;e we might have met them in the way and been brought back into Captivity, our liberty was too precious a thing to be un|con&s;iderately ventured we; there|fore remained a long while in this City expecting a fair opportuni|ty to be gone. At la&s;t one pre|&s;ented it &s;elf not unworthy of our acceptance, the <HI>Turks Ba&s;ha</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> &s;ent an Amba&s;&s;adour to the
<PB N="12" REF="130">
<HI>Precious John,</HI> who coming to <HI>Suez,</HI> we thought we could not meet with a greater happine&s;s if we could be admitted into his re|tinue. We had &s;ome difficulty to obtain this favour, but upon the offer of 200 Crowns, it was rea|dily granted. He took his leave of this City with a great Train, and we accompanyed him upon Mules, we pa&s;&s;ed through many different Soils, &s;ome fruitful, e|&s;pecially of Date-trees, others ve|ry barren. The mo&s;t part of our way was over craggy Mountains, where nothing did pre&s;ent it &s;elf to our view but wild Bea&s;ts far different from tho&s;e that I have &s;een in <HI>Europe.</HI> We pa&s;&s;ed through &s;ome inhabited Land, where very &s;trong Ca&s;tles were e|rected to defend the Country from the enemies, the <HI>Moers</HI> did po&s;&s;e&s;s them, for this Nation is
<PB N="13" REF="130">
di&s;per&s;ed all over this Country, we found al&s;o &s;ome &s;tragling Tents of <HI>Arabians</HI> that wandred up and down, we met with no|thing remarkable, but Poverty and Mi&s;ery, that &s;eem to have taken up their Re&s;idence among&s;t the people that inhabit in this part of the world far in the Country. Their diet is &s;uch things as this barren habitation will afford them; their bread is a root, their fle&s;h is of &s;uch wild Creatures as they can happily kill, their Cloathing proclaims their needy condition, it is made of a large leaf of a Tree that grows in the Forre&s;ts and Woods, neither is it &s;ufficient to cover the back, &s;o it hides the <HI>pu|denda hominis,</HI> they are abundant|ly content; for that purpo&s;e a &s;tring is ty'd above their middle unto which the&s;e leaves are fa&s;te|ned, &s;o that like &s;o many Pen|dants
<PB N="14" REF="131">
they fall down and cover what nature teaches to hide. They have one conveniency and advan|tage which they enjoy above our common people, as our Princes and Noblemen of <HI>Europe</HI> they wear not their Apparel long, they change often, almo&s;t every day. The&s;e ra&s;cally &s;ort of people that nature hath brought forth a|mong&s;t the&s;e mountains, did ap|pear unto us almo&s;t like Savages, they did not willingly come in our company, nor are they de&s;irous to change their habitation, their bo|dies were big, and their Members thick and &s;warthy, they &s;poke a mixt <HI>Arabian,</HI> not well to be under+&s;tood but by tho&s;e that know all the dialects of that language; tho&s;e that live in the fortified places are far more &s;ociable, they had cho&s;en the mo&s;t convenient &s;eats for their re&s;idence, &s;ome of the ground was
<PB N="15" REF="131">
fit to Sow and Plow, and to feed Cattel. We were admitted into one of the&s;e Ca&s;tles that was e|rected in the pa&s;&s;age of a mountain very conveniently to hinder and &s;top the cour&s;e of any enemy; the Commander in chief was a <HI>Moor,</HI> he received us with &s;ome expre&s;|&s;ions of affection, but before we deparred we were forced to pay dear for our entertainment, ten Dollers a piece, for that is a Coin that is currant over all the world. The Emba&s;&s;adour and tho&s;e that did wait upon him were free, but for all &s;trangers that did follow him in his journey, they were ob|liged to lay down the money or return back again. This little Ty|rant had gathered together &s;ome numbers of men, who lived thus in this difficult place upon all pa&s;&s;en|gers, forcing them to contribute to the maintenance of their lazy bo|dies.
<PB N="16" REF="132">
There are many &s;uch peo|ple that exact upon &s;trangers, the Governors for the <HI>Turk</HI> do wink at them, becau&s;e at a certain time of the year they &s;end a &s;weet per|fume unto them, a Pur&s;e full of Gold and Silver, and in con&s;idera|tion of this yearly tribute, they &s;uffer them to exact, cheat and rob the poor Travellers and Mer|chants. We advanced far into the Country many days journey be|fore we came to the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, they were upon their return from pillaging the Chri&s;tians, they were laden with &s;poils and &s;laves. They made as much ha&s;te as they could in their march, for the <HI>Pre|cious John</HI> had gathered his Army together, and was in the pur&s;uit of them from <HI>Suez;</HI> we came fir&s;t into the Country called by the In|habitants <HI>Ganfila,</HI> next to <HI>Dafro|ha,</HI> and &s;o through <HI>Barnaga&s;&s;o, Lacca</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="132">
and part of <HI>Dangali;</HI> we arrived at la&s;t upon the borders. The bo|dy of the <HI>Turks</HI> Army when we met it was near a large lake full of excellent fi&s;h. The people of this Country are ignorant of all kind of Arts, they have not the addre&s;s of fi&s;hing; with Bows and Arrows, they kill Birds and Bea&s;ts upon which they feed and live; they own the <HI>Turks</HI> for their Ma|&s;ters again&s;t their will. This lake is in the Kingdom of <HI>Bamaga&s;&s;o,</HI> which was lately conquered and taken from the Great <HI>Neguz,</HI> the people retain &s;ome Reliques of Chri&s;tianity, but with that igno|rance, that one can &s;carce di&s;tin|gui&s;h them from the Heathens, unle&s;s it be by the name, up and down the Country &s;ome &s;orry hou&s;es are erected, fitter for wild bea&s;ts than men. The walls are of mud and &s;tones, the roofs of a

&s;ort of &s;lender Cane and Reeds which grow near the water &s;ide, and in low places, the middle of it is &s;upported by a Pillar of wood that &s;tands in the huts, and keeps the whole Fabrick from falling to the ground, for this mi&s;erable peo|ple are not acquainted with the Art of Architecture. The Towns are compo&s;ed of this &s;ort of dwel|lings, there are not many of them, but tho&s;e that are, have cho&s;en the be&s;t Land for their &s;cituations near &s;ome fre&s;h waters or lakes; for unle&s;s it be in the&s;e places the ground is parched up all the year long, but during the time of the Rains. In <HI>Egypt</HI> they never fall, but in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> they are very ex|traordinary about the month of <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February.</HI> Such vio|lent &s;howers do pour down, that no creature is able to abide with|out a &s;helter, &s;everal parties of

the <HI>Turks</HI> Army were &s;tragling up and down, but the main body was at the lake <HI>Guere&s;h.</HI> When we came up to them they were com|po&s;ed of Hor&s;e and Foot about &s;ix thou&s;and, not able to abide a a combat with the Aby&s;&s;ins; there|fore they thought upon nothing el&s;e than a &s;afe retreat. They had plundred the Country people that were yet &s;ubject to <HI>Pre&s;ter John,</HI> and had carryed men, wo|men and children into captivity. A &s;ad &s;ight it was unto us that were Chri&s;tians, to behold our brethren and our Chri&s;tian name &s;o mi&s;erably abu&s;ed by the enemy of Chri&s;t, our <HI>Abuna</HI> could not refrain from tears, he laboured to relieve &s;ome of them, and to com|fort them in their affliction, but for fear of di&s;covering him&s;elf, he was not willing to expre&s;s too much grief or kindne&s;s to them. The
<PB N="20" REF="134">
Emba&s;&s;adours credit &s;aved us from all affronts, we lodged two nights with them; for during that time they expected the coming up of &s;ome Troups that were &s;ent to pillage. It is the cu&s;tom of the people that border upon the A|by&s;&s;ins, once a year to vi&s;it their Territories, for they meet with a con&s;iderable deal of plunder with little or no hazard. The Aby&s;&s;ins are more &s;uper&s;titious than war|like, they have been renowned for Valour, but at pre&s;ent they are Cowards, they &s;uffer every petty Nation that is daring to de&s;troy their borders, which is the fault chiefly of their Governors; for having &s;o much Riches as they have, &s;o many Mines of Gold, and other con&s;iderable Commo|dities, they might allow a part to &s;ome war-like people to fight un|der their banners, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them
<PB N="21" REF="134">
again&s;t their trouble&s;ome Neigh|bours. At pre&s;ent they have little communication with people of their Religion, which if they had, it would be a mighty &s;upport to them and their intere&s;t; When the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> were &s;ent with an uncon&s;iderable party into tho&s;e Dominions, the <HI>Aby&s;sin</HI> Empe|rour felt the benefit of forrein &s;uccours, for the enemy was bea|ten in two battels, and forc'd to yield to the Chri&s;tian Valour. Among&s;t the Pri&s;oners &s;everal Noblemens children were &s;een, who by their Meen and Garb were di&s;tingui&s;hable from the or|dinary &s;ort. The&s;e poor creatures were led to be &s;old in <HI>Turky</HI> and other places as bea&s;ts, and the wor&s;t is, they were to be forced to renounce their Religion. What a grief was it to their Chri&s;tian Parents, to &s;uffer &s;uch a lo&s;s, to

have their Sons and Daughters a|mong&s;t the Infidels? This in|conveniency might be prevented, did the&s;e In-land Chri&s;tians keep a &s;trong Guard upon their con|fines, or with a &s;tout re&s;olution labour to drive the&s;e Robbers far from their habitations, or labour to revenge them&s;elves, by carry|ing the War into their own Land, or by &s;eizing on the Sea coa&s;t, and the pa&s;&s;ages of the mountains that limit their Country, where they might place &s;uch &s;trong Ca&s;tles and numerous Guards as might keep the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Moors</HI> from all &s;uch attempts: But when we have fully taken a view of <HI>Aba&s;sia</HI> or <HI>Aethiopia</HI> Superiour, and of the Emperour and Go|vernment, we may be better able to &s;ee the cau&s;e of the&s;e di&s;orders that happen almo&s;t every year in &s;ome corner of the Land.

<P><PB N="135" REF="71">They do believe what&s;oever is in their Books called <HI>Manda</HI> and <HI>Abetil,</HI> as the Go&s;pel it &s;elf; they do fancy that the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples being a&s;&s;embled toge|ther at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> did cau&s;e them to be written for the benefit of Chri&s;tianity.

<P>To meet al&s;o upon the Sab|bath-day, and then to &s;pend the time in prayer and holy duties, in which days it is not permitted to do any &s;ervile work. The <HI>Satur|day</HI> they keep becau&s;e God on that day had fini&s;hed the great Work of the Creation of the world; The Lords-day is al&s;o &s;et apart for Religious duties, becau&s;e Chri&s;t on the fir&s;t day of the week did ri&s;e from the dead.</P>
<P>Several other days of the year are kept holy, &s;ome are tho&s;e that are ob&s;erved in our Church, others are particular days appointed to continue the Memory of &s;ome great deliverances and particu|lar favours which that Church and Empire have received.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="72">They do believe that in their Fe&s;tival days; and in the Sabbath and Lords-day, the &s;ouls of the damned are relea&s;ed from their torments until the Evening, but that they can never come out of that place of darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>Some thoughts they have of Purgatory, but not as we in the Catholick Church; they do not think that Ma&s;&s;es, Prayers, or any other pious actions can convey any benefit to the mi&s;erable &s;ouls that are there frying in the &s;ubterrane|ous ovens; therefore they never be&s;tow their E&s;tates for the dead, but when they are departed, they leave them to their fortunes, as they do us to ours. One thing is very commendable among&s;t them; when any are dead that have left &s;ome vi&s;ible e&s;tate, they &s;end for the poore&s;t per&s;ons of that place, &amp; offer unto them gifts in the name
<PB N="138" REF="73">
of the decea&s;ed; they make a Fea&s;t for others better qualified, and &s;pend two or three days in Mirth and jollity at the expences of the dead; a cu&s;tom derived from the <HI>Scythians,</HI> who did thus rejoyce when their friends depart|ed out of the world, and did cele|brate their entrance into it with the effu&s;ion of tears, or rather this practice is derived from the belief of a Re&s;urrection, and the a&s;&s;u|rance that the party that is dead is free from all the &s;en&s;e of mi&s;e|ry and affliction, unto which the living are expo&s;ed daily.</P>
<P>They do not believe that Ma&s;|&s;es can redeem the &s;ouls of men from the puni&s;hments unto which they are liable by their mi&s;carria|ges, therefore they never &s;ee the Prie&s;t to huddle up before the Al|tar any prayers for them, nor do the dying per&s;ons leave any an|nual
<PB N="139" REF="73">
rents for Ma&s;&s;es to be &s;aid in remembrance of him, or to fetch him out of the flames of Purgato|ry.</P>
<P>The Sacrament of the Eucha|ri&s;t they do admini&s;ter, &s;ometimes every Sunday or Sabbath-day, but as it was anciently practi&s;ed by the the Chri&s;tians of Primitive times in both kinds. They are not afraid of that inconvenience that the wi&s;e men of our latter days have thought upon, of profaning the bloud of Chri&s;t upon every unhal|lowed lip, or by &s;pilling it on the ground, therefore the people do receive with the Prie&s;t in a mo&s;t humble manner, almo&s;t pro&s;trate to the ground, before they take it into their hands, they make three bows to expre&s;s the &s;acred Trinity of per&s;ons, and then with lifted up eyes and hands they eat the wa|fer, or the bread, and drink of the
<PB N="140" REF="74">
cup, ki&s;&s;ing it before they part with it out of their hands. They have as much reverence for that Sacrament, as we in <HI>Italy,</HI> but they do not think the bread to be Tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into fle&s;h, nor the wine into bloud, nor do they pay any re&s;pect unto it, but only when they do receive it. I did en|quire of &s;ome of them why they did eat it with that reverence, &s;ee|ing they did not fancy it other than our ordinary bread; the an&s;wer was, that it was con&s;ecrated to a holy u&s;e, and that &s;ome re&s;pect was therefore due unto the Ele|ments of Bread and Wine; but when that &s;hould not be, the mo&s;t humble po&s;ture was mo&s;t decent for tho&s;e that received from Al|mighty God, &s;o great a favour as the &s;igns of Chri&s;t Crucified. They do not pre&s;erve either the Bread or Wine upon their Altars (that
<PB N="141" REF="74">
are much like ours) to another day, nor do they &s;end it to comfort the &s;ick; that cu&s;tom they do not approve of, becau&s;e they may &s;o frequently receive it every where, that they do not &s;tand in need of it in &s;o &s;hort a time as their &s;ick per&s;ons do continue in their crazie e&s;tate.</P>
<P>This cu&s;tom they have among&s;t them, that when any hath recei|ved the Bread and Wine, he ne|ver ventures to &s;pit all that day, but retains all the humidity that flows into his mouth, and &s;wallows it for fear of ca&s;ting to the ground any part of that Cup that was in|tended for to increa&s;e their faith. This cu&s;tom is kept &s;o Religiou|&s;ly, that there is a great penalty put upon every one that is &s;een to &s;uffer any water to go out of his mouth that day, untill the eve|ning; he is forced to pay to the
<PB N="142" REF="75">
poor, and towards the reparations of their Church a large &s;umme of money, and to &s;uffer an impri&s;on|ment &s;ix days, during which time he hath &s;carce enough of water allowed unto him to drink. Thus they puni&s;h exce&s;s or want of ab|&s;tinence by want of nece&s;&s;aries, a good way to make a man &s;ober. They give the Sacrament not only to men grown up in years, but al&s;o to Babes and Children, for they do imagine, that &s;eeing Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles do e&s;teem them holy, of the body of the Church, and commands them to be admitted into the Communion of Chri|&s;tians, that therefore it is lawful to grant unto them the priviledges of Chri&s;tian people, as if they had an actual faith as tho&s;e that are more aged have. They are igno|rant of tho&s;e great di&s;putes that have lately allarm'd <HI>Europe,</HI> and
<PB N="143" REF="75">
are not acquainted with theniceties that have put us together by the ears about the Euchari&s;t. They know nothing of Tran&s;ub&s;tantia|tion, the words of the Con&s;ecra|tion they under&s;tand, without any interpretation, that they declare unto us the u&s;e and benefits that we are to receive by this Sacra|ment in the Chri&s;tian Church. They do not trouble their heads whether per&s;onally or virtually, whether corporally or &s;piritually Chri&s;t is pre&s;ent in his Ordinance. They hope for &s;alvation without the knowledge of the&s;e curio&s;ities, and I think they will attain unto it before us that are carryed by the&s;e di&s;putes of the Schools to deadly animo&s;ities again&s;t our brethren; we had been in <HI>Europe</HI> very happy, if the liberty of be|lieving in this particular had been left to every one of us, but the
<PB N="144" REF="76">
Devil cannot fi&s;h but in troubled waters, and turbulent men have rai&s;ed the&s;e di&s;putes for their own intere&s;t, but could never bring any benefit to the publick by them, but ruine and de&s;tructi|on. If like the <HI>Aby&s;sin</HI> Church, we had not troubled our &s;elves a|bout trifles, we had &s;pared the bloud of many Chri&s;tian Nations, and might be more ready to op|po&s;e the <HI>Turk,</HI> that daily incroaches upon us. In the celebration of the Sacrament, they u&s;e no cere|monies, nor in&s;ignificant ge&s;tures at the Con&s;ecration, but as Chir&s;t commanded, &s;o they practice; the Bread is of the ordinary bread that they u&s;e in tho&s;e Kingdoms, they take of the better &s;ort for this u&s;e, and lay it in a large plate of Gold or Earth of a blew colour, and the Wine is of the juice of the Grape &s;queezed out of it on purpo&s;e.
<PB N="145" REF="76">
They place both very hand&s;omely upon a Table or Altar at the end of the Church, and after the Con|&s;ecration, the Prie&s;t followed by &s;ome Attendants, goes to the &s;e|veral Separations, where he deli|vers both kinds to them, and they receive them with the greate&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of humility and thank|fulne&s;s imaginable; after all is done, they &s;ing a Hymn in the Church, and the Prie&s;t gives them leave to depart with a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>They baptize both Male and Female, the Male on the tenth day, the Female on the eighth. This Sacrament they often do rei|terate, but not out of nece&s;&s;ity, but out of a cu&s;tom that hath continued many hundred years derived as &s;ome do conceive from the practice of the <HI>Jews,</HI> that thought the bodily wa&s;hing able to contribute to the &s;alvation of
<PB N="146" REF="77">
the &s;oul. The&s;e people therefore that were zealous Profe&s;&s;ors of that Religion, do yet retain many of their cu&s;toms, although they do not believe tho&s;e things that occa&s;ioned them at fir&s;t for that rea&s;on they circumci&s;e, they often wa&s;h, and to render their wa&s;hing more beneficial, the Prie&s;t on the day of <HI>Epiphany</HI> repeats over to the per&s;ons &s;prinkled the words of Bapti&s;m, <HI>I baptize thee in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</HI> All of them do declare that they retain this cu|&s;tom not out of the belief of its nece&s;&s;ity, but only becau&s;e it hath continued &s;o long time among&s;t them for &s;o many hundred years, they know not how to reform it. But I think that they have no mind to reform or leave it, be|cau&s;e it flatters the intere&s;t of both Prie&s;t and people; for on that day the Princes officers do
<PB N="147" REF="77">
make a Fea&s;t, and give gifts in the name of their Emperour to &s;eve|ral per&s;ons, they rejoyce and &s;uf|fer none to do any &s;ervile work. This cu&s;tom is &s;trengthned by a Law very ancient, that who&s;oe|ver is then baptized &s;hould be free from &s;ome &s;mall impo&s;itions that are laid upon them by the Prince. Their former Kings have thus in|tere&s;&s;ed the people in the obedi|ence to their pious commands, &s;o that although they &s;ee how the performance is in&s;ignificant and u&s;ele&s;s, neverthele&s;s they do as Religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve this cu&s;tom, as if upon it did depend their e|ternal &s;alvation; when the Chil|dren are baptized, they give the Bread of the Sacrament &s;oftned in &s;ome Liquor to them.</P>
<P>Their Religion in general is a mixture of the Jewi&s;h and Chri|&s;tian, for they ob&s;erve many of
<PB N="148" REF="78">
the Ordinances of the Law of <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> that were meerly ceremonial, only becau&s;e their fore-fathers did &s;o. This people hath always had a great Veneration for that which is derived unto them by in|heritance, and in which they were fir&s;t educated, &s;o that they dare not venture to alter what was re|commended unto them by their Ance&s;tors practice, they wi&s;ely fore-&s;ee the di&s;orders that change would bring among&s;t them, e|&s;pecially when the cu&s;toms and ceremonies ob&s;erved are in them|&s;elves indifferent.</P>
<P>If any be polluted according to the Law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> they forbid him to enter the Church until twenty four hours be pa&s;t, and then he mu&s;t clean&s;e him&s;elf with water.</P>
<P>For their Churches they have a great Veneration, in&s;omuch, that
<PB N="149" REF="78">
in them they neither &s;pit nor &s;uf|fer any unclean creature to enter, when they do go in, they take off their &s;hooes, the rea&s;on that they do alledge is this, becau&s;e <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was commanded to appear before the bu&s;h with naked feet, their Temples being as holy as that place on which he did tread, they think them&s;elves obliged to fol|low the &s;ame Religious practice. They will not al&s;o &s;uffer any to walk up and down in their Chur|ches, nor to di&s;cour&s;e of their pri|vate bu&s;ine&s;s, nor to laugh, &s;o highly do they reverence them; our people in <HI>Italy</HI> do profe&s;s as much outward re&s;pect, but they bear le&s;s to the Hou&s;es of prayer, for it is ordinary among&s;t us to make the great Churches a Ren|dezvous of Lovers in&s;tead of praying to a Saint, many whi&s;per their devotions to their Mi&s;tre&s;|&s;es
<PB N="150" REF="79">
that are at their &s;ides; and they do return an&s;wers accordingly; thus they cheat the world that fancies them at their prayers, and they profane the holy places with unhallowed and la&s;civious actions. The <HI>Aby&s;sins</HI> do &s;hew unto &s;uch an excellent example of piety and and devotion. They are no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s Religious in the other ob&s;ervances of Religion; the water in Bapti&s;m it is true they do not &s;anctifie by exorci&s;ms, nor do they mingle any other ingredient, but as the Eu|nuch of Queen <HI>Candaces</HI> was Bap|ti&s;ed by pure water, &s;o do they dip or &s;prinkle with the &s;ame element free from mixture; all that are bap|ti&s;ed, they either dip or &s;prinkle them, that is left to the plea&s;ure and choice of the Mini&s;ter as he &s;ees convenient, or as the con|dition of the child requires he accordingly deals with it
<PB N="151" REF="79">
And when the child is but be|&s;prinkled with water, he is lookt upon as well baptized as if he had been wa&s;hed in the main Ocean over head and ears, for they think not that the quantity of water does bring any advantage to the &s;oul, nor that an entire wa&s;hing is e&s;&s;ential to the Sacrament of bap|ti&s;m, but rather &s;o much only as may &s;uffice to &s;ignifie the inward wa&s;hing and clen&s;ing of the mind from all filthy inclination.</P>
<P>Their circumci&s;ion as we have &s;aid, they will not leave, but they do not e&s;teem them&s;elves for it, nor do they di&s;-e&s;teem other Chri&s;tians for wanting it, for they are &s;en&s;ible that the ceremony doth not render them more ac|ceptable to Almighty God, nor doth it give them a pre-emi|nence above others. It were to be wi&s;hed that Chri&s;tians over all the
<PB N="152" REF="80">
world were of their di&s;po&s;ition, they would not then cur&s;e and damn their brethren for trifles, nor &s;end them to hell becau&s;e they do not jump with them into the &s;ame opinions, and follow the &s;ame frivolous cu&s;toms invented by them&s;elves. A Chri&s;tian con|de&s;cention becomes us, we &s;hould not rack and &s;end to the flames, men of the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, be|cau&s;e only they do not joyn with us in indifferent performances; but my de&s;ign is not to &s;hew the un|ju&s;tice of the Court of Inqui&s;iti|on, nor the cruelty of our Prelates again&s;t the di&s;&s;enting per&s;ons that are &s;cattered all over <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> but to declare the practice of the <HI>Aethioplan</HI> Church, and their moderation.</P>
<P>They have not that uncharita|ble opinion of unbaptized Infants as we have, they do not judge
<PB N="153" REF="80">
them in hell or any other place out of Paradi&s;e, becau&s;e they have not had the happine&s;s to receive the Seal of the Covenant, but they name them half Chri&s;tians here, and think that heaven is pre|pared for them as well as for the re&s;t of mankind hereafter, becau&s;e that they are born of Chri&s;tian Parents, &s;anctified from the womb and in the womb, by drawing &s;ome nouri&s;hment from the Sacrament of the Euchari&s;t when their Mo|thers do receive it, the lea&s;t part of that being &s;ufficient to &s;anctifie them.</P>
<P>They often make u&s;e of Con|fe&s;&s;ion, not as we do, but in a man|ner that commends their mode|ration, their wi&s;dom and mode&s;ty. The per&s;ons that are to confe&s;s do meet the Prie&s;t at certain days in the Church before prayers do begin, where they privately con|fe&s;s
<PB N="154" REF="81">
unto him in general all tho&s;e &s;ins of which they are guilty; they name them not unle&s;s they be heavy upon their con&s;ciences, then they con&s;ult him about the reme|dies proper to &s;atisfie them&s;elves, and about the means to avoid &s;uch mi&s;carriages for the future. I could never learn that they were tyed to this by any other Law, but that which is derived from their own nece&s;&s;ity and good; they are not tyed to particularize their crimes unle&s;s they &s;ee it conveni|ent for their comfort and refor|mation. The Prie&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ts them in this occa&s;ion, a&s;&s;ures them of the mercy of God, of the pardon of their &s;ins if they continue in that repentant, &s;orrow, and if it can produce the amendment of their lives. He prayes for them, and then &s;ends them away with a ble&s;|&s;ing. The woman that is near the
<PB N="155" REF="81">
time of her travel is wont to &s;eek this comfort from her Gho&s;tly Father. The man that is to under|take &s;ome long or perillous jour|ney unloads and di&s;charges his con&s;cience thus to render him&s;elf more ready to undergo the hazard. Tho&s;e that march out with the armies, take with them &s;ome word of exhortation and comfort from their Prie&s;ts, they e&s;teem this cu|&s;tom nece&s;&s;ary to them for the maintenance of Chri&s;tian Religi|on, and &s;tir up from time to time mens drow&s;ie and &s;otti&s;h &s;pirits in the duties of Religion. By this means al&s;o the Prie&s;ts do creep into the favour of every one, and become nece&s;&s;ary in their Gene|ration. We are naturally prone to contempt and &s;loathfulne&s;s in devotion, this practice is mo&s;t proper to remove and rid us of tho&s;e vices. Their confe&s;&s;ions are more mode&s;t, more bene|ficial
<PB N="156" REF="82">
and Chri&s;tian-like than ours are. The Prie&s;t doth not by any power granted unto him pretend to ab&s;olve them, but he &s;hews them the gracious promi&s;es of God in his word, and tells them how plea&s;ed he is at repentance, what hopes there are of his mer|cy, he al&s;o warns them to forbear from ill company, and other temp|tations that do endanger our e|&s;tate; after confe&s;&s;ion they receive the Euchari&s;t.</P>
<P>They acknowledge the Old and New Te&s;tament without any addition to them 46 of the old 35 of the new are the number of the books; unto the&s;e they think it not lawful to make any additi|on, but they ob&s;erve many other things that are not contained in the&s;e books.

and to give order to all the contingencies that do happen in a large Empire very often. This great a&s;&s;embly meets in the pre|&s;ence of their Emperour to con|&s;ult about the pre&s;ervation of them&s;elves and of Religion; the <HI>Abuna</HI> &s;its in the Chair, unle&s;s when the Emperour appears a|mong&s;t them him&s;elf, then the <HI>Abuna</HI> &s;its at his feet, and a Throne is erected a purpo&s;e for the <HI>Neguz,</HI> the Clergy, Bi&s;hops and other per&s;ons called from all the Kingdoms, are round about in a Ring in &s;everal ranks; when any is to &s;peak, he ri&s;eth from his place and goes forth into the middle, and after an humble obei&s;ance to the <HI>Abuna</HI> or Emperour, he declares his judgment, the plurality of voi|ces determines the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="83">The affirmative part do lift up their fore-finger, and profe&s;s at the &s;ame time their con&s;ent, and if the plurality be on their &s;ide a|bove two or three per&s;ons, their judgment is good and lawful, o|therwi&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s is debated untill that number be found in ei|ther &s;ide. Their decrees are con|firmed by the Emperour and his Privy Coun&s;el, and nothing is lawful without his con&s;ent. He is the only Prince that governs in his dominions, none dares but by force of Arms pretend any juri&s;diction over his &s;ubjects but him&s;elf, therefore he &s;uffers nothing either in Church or State to be obeyed or impo&s;ed without his cogni|zance. The Bi&s;hops and Clergy have a power to execute their of|fice, teach the people their duty, and &s;ee to their &s;everal charges, but they dare not innovate or

command the lea&s;t new thing al|though it be very nece&s;&s;ary, with|out the Emperors leave. He com|monly declares his plea&s;ure by granting a writing, unto which his Picture is annexed as a Seal, with a great Cro&s;s in his left hand, and a &s;word in his right. This Proclama|tion is conveyed into tho&s;e parts that it concerns, where the people do in a mo&s;t humble manner re|ceive it. When P. <HI>Clem.</HI> &s;ollicited him to &s;ubmit to the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> he would never do it, but com|manded the Emba&s;&s;adour that had made that propo&s;ition, to depart out of his dominions, where he had created a great di&s;turbance, by divulging Doctrines that were not known in tho&s;e parts before.</P>
<P>Thus the Emperour is &s;ole Lord of both Spiritual and Tem|poral, and will not give an account of his actions to any one upon

earth. He is re&s;pected according to his Authority or Power, none dares oppo&s;e or contradict his commands, but they all yield a blind obedience unto them, pro|fe&s;&s;ing their willingne&s;s to &s;ubmit by ki&s;&s;ing on their knees the wri|ting that is brought unto them.</P>

He was very &s;uc|ce&s;sful again&s;t all our Neighbours, e&s;pecially again&s;t the Blacks that inhabit beyond the &s;ands, their Princes came to do homage unto our mighty Emperour, and to pay their yearly tribute; they conti|nued in their obedience many years, until the Reign of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the third, a Prince that was given to all manner of debauchery, he Reigned ten years, and was after|wards killed by his chief Officers&punc;

From that time we have nothing remarkable, until Chri&s;ts death at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> for all the Princes that did rule until that time were neither good nor bad, they contented them&s;elves with their own limits, and if they did lo&s;e any part of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they never made any great noi&s;e by rai&s;ing their Armies to retake them.

They were afterwards neglected and ruinated by the Wars. He fir&s;t began to encourage Shipping, by offering great advantages to the Mariners and men that did &s;tudy the Art of Navigation. This good policy cau&s;ed all the idle per&s;ons to render them&s;elves ex|cellent in the Sea affairs, and laid the Foundation to that greatne&s;s, unto which the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Empire did afterwards ri&s;e.</P>

This Prince was full of piety, he reformed the di&s;orders of the Clergy, and put them in that form of Government in which they are at pre&s;ent; before, the per&s;ons that did wait upon the Wor&s;hip of God, had no &s;et|led allowance; the people gave them what they plea&s;ed, &s;o that unle&s;s they did work as other peo|ple for their livings, they were reduced to great nece&s;&s;ities, which neverthele&s;s did happen in many places, for he that depends upon his peoples kindne&s;s, &s;hall be en|entertain'd with cour&s;e Diet; unto this great evil that entroduces

This liberality redeemed the Clergy from con|tempt, and rai&s;ed them in the e|&s;teem of the people, that u&s;ually treats them, not according to their de&s;ert, but according to that State that they maintain.</P>
