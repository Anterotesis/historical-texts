<P>_THe 20. of Aprill 1601. we wayed Anchor and &s;et &s;aile out of <HI>Torbay</HI> by <HI>Dartmouth.</HI></P>
<P>The 2. of May one of our Admiralles men fell ouer|boord from the maine yard and was drowned.</P>
<P>The 7. of May we came to the <HI>Canares,</HI> where the Generall determined to renew our water: but altering his purpo&s;e, we wayed our Anchors and departed with a faire winde.</P>
<P>The 10. of May being Sunday the Generall, Captaines and Mai&s;ters dined a boord the <HI>Hector.</HI> Where the generall deliuered them articles to be ob&s;erued and kept both by &s;ea and land, and what puni&s;hme~t &s;hould be inflicted vpon the offenders.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>The 12. of May wee pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tropicke</HI> with a fre&s;h gaile.</P>
<P>The 24. we had a great &s;torme.</P>
<P>The 25. we had a &s;torme with great &s;tore of raine.</P>
<P>The 27. we had another &s;torme continuing two houres.</P>
<P>The 21. of Iune we tooke a Porting all who&s;e lading was Wine, Oyle, and Meale, being about the burthen of 100. tunne; who not re&s;i&s;ting was di&s;charged of his Marchandi&s;e in foure dayes, to euery &s;hip according to his proportion.</P>
<P>The 29. of Iune we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> with a fre&s;h gale of winde.</P>
<P>The 12. of Iuly our mai&s;ter Gunner of the <HI>A&s;cention</HI> dyed, who was the fir&s;t that dyed in that &s;hip: Here we tooke many flying fi&s;hes in the Aire.</P>
<P>The 16. of Iuly we doubled the &s;hoales of Bra&s;|eele, and for ioy thereof, euery me&s;&s;e had a canne of Wine to &s;upper.</P>
<P>The 20. of Iuly we ca&s;t off the <HI>Guift,</HI> being a|bout 18. degrees to the South of the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> here we tooke more fi&s;h then we could eate.</P>
<P>About the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t many of our men in euery &s;hip fell &s;icke of the &s;curuy, &s;o that many di|ed, and few were free of the infection throughout the fleete: &s;o that there died 80. men in the fleete before we came to land.</P>
<P>The 9. of September, it plea&s;ed God after our
<PB N="3" REF="3">long di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to &s;end vs to the &s;ight of land at <HI>Sol|dania</HI> 16. leagues from the <HI>Cape de bona E&s;perance,</HI> and becau&s;e it was in the night, and all our men ve|ry weake, we were in great danger, beeing very neare the &s;hoare, but God &s;tre~gthned vs, &s;o that by his helpe, and the helpe of &s;ome of our Admiralles men when they had mored their &s;hip, we were pre|&s;erued not being able to helpe our &s;elues.</P>
<P>The 10. day our Generall went a &s;hoare to &s;ee if he could get &s;ome fre&s;h victuals, and after hee had talked with the countrey people they made &s;ignes that they would bring Oxen and Sheepe within two or three &s;leepes.</P>
<P>The 14. day euery &s;hip &s;ent proui&s;ion on &s;hoare for the building of <HI>Tents,</HI> and this day the inhabi|tantes of the country brought bullockes and &s;heep and &s;o continued day lie for 12 dayes togeather, &s;o that there were bought about 900 or 1000. &s;heep and bullockes in that time, The price of a bullock was two peeces of Yron hoopes of 6. inches long a peece, and the price of a &s;heepe one peece of the &s;ame length, prouided that the oxen and &s;heepe were fat, or el&s;e we would not buy them. The people are blacke and goe naked, &s;auing that they weare &s;hort coates of Seales skinne, and a peece of the &s;ame skinne about their members, they are tall of &s;tature, flat no&s;ed, &s;wift in running, they will picke &amp; &s;teale, although you looke on them: Their language is very hard to be pronounced by rea&s;on of a kinde of clacking with the tongue, &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="4">that we could not learne one worde of their lan|guage: The country is full of plea&s;ant riuers, there is al&s;o Deare, Quailes, and Partriges: In this baye there is a &s;mall Iland not inhabited nor any good thing groweth: Thither did the general &s;e~d 6. &s;heep and two rammes, for the reliefe of &s;trangers that might come thither, which &s;hortly after was found there by certaine Flemmings to their reliefe, be|cau&s;e they could get no cattell of the country peo|ple. In this Iland, there is great aboundance of Seales, and Penguines, in &s;uch number as is almo&s;t incredible? The Seales, &s;ome are iu&s;&s;et &amp; &s;ome are blacke, both vgly &amp; fearefull to looke on, the olde ones which are as big almo&s;t as a Beare, cry like a Beare, and the young ones crie like vnto Lambes, they haue but two feete, yet they v&s;e their hinder partes in going, by which meanes, they will goe or clime vp any rocke a great pace, &s;ome of the&s;e we killed and made oyle of them, and &s;ome of the younge&s;t we did eate, which to vs &s;eemed good meate. They lay partly on land, and partly in the water, for there is their refuge. The Penguine is as &s;trange as the other, being a bird which hath a &s;trange and a proude kinde of going, they are of the bigne&s;&s;e of a Ducke, they haue finny wings with which they &s;wim a great pace, but cannot flie, and the&s;e are in &s;uch aboundance that you may take them vp with your hands as many as you will, the egges of the&s;e Penguines was there in &s;uch a|boundance as we could not almo&s;t go for them, &s;o
<PB N="5" REF="4">that we laded our boat with Seales, Penguines, and egges in two houres; In this Bay likewi&s;e as it is credibly reported by the Flemmings, there is ano|ther Iland of Conies, in as great aboundance as the other of Seales and Penguines.</P>
<P>Before our departure from hence we had a Ser|mon and a Communion one a Sunday in the forenoone, and afternoone one of our men which was a Iew, was chri&s;tened and called <HI>Iohn,</HI> our <HI>Ge|nerall</HI> being his godfather.</P>
<P>The 29. of October we wayed our Anchors, and &s;et &s;aile, there being dead in the whole fleete at this time 107. and others that were &s;icke recoue|red to health.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of Nouember we doubled the <HI>Cape de|bona E&s;perance</HI> with great &s;tore of winde, raine, and haile.</P>
<P>The 26. we &s;aw Saint <HI>Laurence.</HI></P>
<P>The 2. of December we had &s;o many huge and great Grampoy&s;es about our &s;hippe as was &s;trange and wonderfull.</P>
<P>The 4. of December we had great &s;tormes which continued al day and the &s;ame night, &s;o that we were in danger to loo&s;e &s;ome of our compa|ny.</P>
<P>The 16. we &s;aw the land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> and the Iland of Saint <HI>Marie,</HI> and the next day we ca&s;t an Anchor betweene both landes, and &s;ent our boats to Saint <HI>Maries</HI> to &s;ee what was to be gotten; but could get nothing there but Oringes &amp; Lemmans
<PB N="6" REF="5">of which we made good &s;toare of water, which is the be&s;t remedy again&s;t the &s;curuy, here we conti|nued 3. or 4. dayes but could get no other things, but lemmons, &s;ome hony combes, &s;ome milke, and &s;ome rice which we bought for beades, we &s;aw but only one Cow, which they draue away as &s;oone as they &s;aw vs, whereby we imagined they had &s;mall &s;tore. The people of this Iland are of a tall &s;tature and very well limmed and proportioned &s;uch as we haue not &s;eene in the&s;e parts of the world, they go naked &s;auing about their members they weare cloath made of the barkes of trees, and the women weare of the &s;ame &s;tuffe from their brea&s;ts to their feete.</P>
<P>The 21. we had a mighty &s;torme both of winde and raine, &s;o that our &s;hip lo&s;t an Anchor, the <HI>Hector</HI> let &s;lip her Anchor, and the <HI>Su&s;an</HI> broake her bow &s;prit, and here we were in great danger, by rea&s;on we were in &s;uch a &s;traight betweene two landes: here our &s;hip was almo&s;t aboord the Admirall, but God deliuered vs, this &s;torme continued 12. houres very forcible, in which time two of our Admirals men fell from the maine yarde, whereof one was &s;aued and the other drowned, and as the winde was vehement, &s;o the aire was very thicke and mi&s;ty which made it the more dange|rous.</P>
<P>The 26. day we Anchored in the Baye of <HI>An|togill,</HI> and the next daye our boates were &s;ent on &s;hoare and meeting with the people of the
<PB N="7" REF="5">Countrie, we bought of them Rice, Lemmons &amp; Plantons, in great quantitie and number, for we bought a mea&s;ure of Rice which wayed two pounds and a halfe, for a bloud-&s;tone, or a blew Bead, and twentie Lemmons, or twentie Plan|tons for a Bead. In this place they haue &s;mall &s;tore of Cattell, but they went with vs vnto another Baye, where there was more &s;tore, of whome we bought two or three, giuing fiue and thirtie Chri|&s;tall Beads for a Bullocke, and afterwards becau&s;e they would &s;ell vs no more, wee went and tooke &s;ome from them perforce, giuing them in Beads as we paide for the other, to the valew of ten &s;hil|lings.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of Ianuary wee began to build our Pinnace.</P>
<P>The 7. of Ianuary, fiue of the <HI>Su&s;ans</HI> compa|nie, being &s;ome boyes, and &s;ome youthes, &s;toale away the Boate from the &s;hips &s;tearne, thinking to haue gone to the Maine to haue liued there, but by chaunce were e&s;pyed, &s;o that they were faine to put them&s;elues on &s;hoare vppon a &s;mall Iland not inhabited, where they continued two or three dayes, and beeing weary of their faire and lodging, came againe aboorde, and were puni&s;hed for their offences.</P>
<P>The 17. of Ianuary, one <HI>Chri&s;topher New|church</HI> our Surgeon of the <HI>A&s;cention</HI> poy&s;oned him&s;elfe, but it did not worke his death: yet was he greeuou&s;ly tormented for three or foure dayes,
<PB N="8" REF="6">for which cau&s;e he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed of his place, and &s;hould haue beene left in this place a &s;hoare, had not Mai&s;ter <HI>Hauers</HI> intreated for him who tooke him into his &s;hippe to liue as an ordynary man.</P>
<P>The 4. day of February we had a great &s;torme of winde and raine, which continued all day and the &s;ame night.</P>
<P>The 20. day Mai&s;ter <HI>Brodbancke,</HI> Mai&s;ter of the Admirall died.</P>
<P>The 23. day of February, Mai&s;ter <HI>Pullin</HI> our prea|cher died.</P>
<P>The 23. day Mai&s;ter <HI>Napper</HI> Mai&s;ter of the vice Admirall died, and the &s;ame day one of our Admi|rals men being &s;icke of the Calanture, leaped ouer|boord and was no more &s;eene.</P>
<P>The 27. day being Saterday, the lamentable&s;t accident happened, that happened &s;ince wee de|parted England, and thus it was, Mai&s;ter <HI>Winter</HI> the Mai&s;ters Mate of the Admiral dying, the re&s;t of the Captaines and Mai&s;ters went to his burial and according to the order of the &s;ea, there was 2. or 3. great ordinances di&s;charged at his going a &s;hoare, but the mai&s;ter Gunner of the Admirall being not &s;o carefull as he &s;hould haue beene, vnfortunately killed Mai&s;ter <HI>Brand</HI> Captaine of the <HI>A&s;cention</HI> and the Boat&s;waines mate of the &s;ame &s;hip, to the great danger of the Mai&s;ter, his mare and another Mar|chant who were hurt and be&s;princkled with the bloud of the&s;e ma&s;&s;acred men, &s;o the&s;e men going to the buriall of another were them&s;elues carryed
<PB N="9" REF="6">to their owne graues. Thus did we loo&s;e a man re|ligious, wi&s;e &amp; prouident; &s;uch a one as the whole fleete will mi&s;&s;e, both for good husbandry, care, and good aduice: Vpon the&s;e alterations <HI>Roger Hau|kin</HI> was made mai&s;ter of the Admirall, mai&s;ter <HI>In|deck</HI> mai&s;ter of the vice Admirall, for mai&s;ter <HI>Nap|per</HI> was dead, mai&s;ter <HI>Coale</HI> mai&s;ter of the A&s;centi|on, mai&s;ter <HI>Pope</HI> was made Captaine of the A&s;cen|tion and &s;ome of the other Marchants remooued &s;ome to one &s;hip, &s;ome to another.</P>
<P>The 4. day of March, wee &s;et &s;aile out of this tempe&s;tuous and vnfortunate Baye, where there was many men died of the flixe out of the Admi|rall. So that wee continued here two monethes and eight dayes, hauing for the mo&s;t part euery daye fearefull thunder, raine and lightenning, as the like is not heard in our countrey, for they haue many &s;laine with the thunder which maketh them make ha&s;t to gette home before night. The people are very indu&s;trious and take great paines, both in &s;etting of Rice which groweth there in great quantytie, &s;o that there is whole &s;tackes thereof, as al&s;o in beating and winnowing the &s;ame. They weaue &s;uch thinges as they weare about their bodyes beeing made of the barke of trees. Their hou&s;es are but meane, &s;tanding halfe a yarde from the ground and couered with leaues, with a hoale at one ende of the &s;ame hou&s;e to creepe in at on their knees.

The chiefe Gouernour came aboorde of vs with his wife to dinner, where we might perceiue their manner of feeding to be very homely, and for their a&s;&s;urance of &s;afe|tie, there was &s;o many &s;ent a &s;hoare as came a|boord, and after dinner, Captaine <HI>Middleton</HI> gaue the principall man a thinne &s;hute of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> &s;tuffe, which plea&s;ed him well.</P>

<P>The 17. day of Aprill, we pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Equinocti|all</HI> line which is the &s;econd time that we pa&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P>The 30. day of March we were on the &s;hoales of <HI>Adu</HI> which is nine degrees to the South of the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> and at the fir&s;t &s;ight of ground (being full of rockes) our &s;hip had but 4. fadome and a halfe, here we were in great danger, being inclo&s;ed &amp; compa&s;&s;ed round with rocks as in a pound, and hauing &s;pent 2. dayes and nights in turning and re|turning but could finde no way out, at the length the Pinnace was &s;ent before to finde where there was lea&s;t danger, and hauing found 7. or 8 fadom we all followed her and hauing pa&s;&s;ed this danger, we gaue God the prai&s;e which had mercifully de|liuered vs.</P>
<P>The 7. day of May, we had &s;ight of <HI>Nicombar,</HI> which is about 40. leagues from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> this night following we had a great &s;torme, and in this &s;torme if God had not deliuered vs wonderfully our &s;hip or the <HI>Hector,</HI> or both had &s;uncke in the &s;ea, being almo&s;t aboord of one another in lying of tho&s;e I|lands: this night al&s;o we lo&s;t company with the Pinnace, but within 2. or 3. dayes &s;he came to vs in that habor, here we &s;tayed 9. or 10. dayes to wa|ter and balla&s;t our &s;hippes and to mount our or|dinance. The people of the country brought vs aboord Coaker nuts, Ca&s;&s;ado roots, Pouncea|trones, and Lemmons, and &s;ome hens, but they made dainty of their hens, for they would not &s;ell
<PB N="12" REF="8">them vnder two Counters a peece, taking them for gould, although they &s;olde other things for olde peeces of Linnen, and &s;mall peeces of Yron hoopes, &s;ome of the&s;e people &s;peake <HI>Portugale,</HI> who tolde vs that the <HI>Portugales</HI> v&s;e to put into this harbor as they goe to <HI>Mallacca,</HI> and that two <HI>Gallions</HI> were there two moneths before our com|ming thether, which had bought all the Amber-Gree&s;e was to be gotten.</P>
<P>The 18. day we &s;et &s;aile from hence, but by rea|&s;on of fowle weather, and contrary windes, our Admirall lo&s;t his boate, and &s;prung a leake, and therefore would haue fetched that harbor againe, but could not.

<P>The 2. of Iune, wee anckored in the roade of <HI>Dachen,</HI> where wee had of the countrie people came aboorde of vs with their Canows, grea|ter then any wee had &s;eene before, hauing raf|ters of eache &s;ide of them, &s;o that they cannot &s;incke.</P>
<P>The next day, there came &s;ome of the Factors for the Flemmings aboorde of vs, to welcome vs into that Countrey.

<P>The 4. of Iune being Saterday, the Generall went on &s;hoare, accompanied with Captaine <HI>Ha|uers,</HI> Captaine <HI>Pope,</HI> and many other Marchants, to deliuer the Queenes letter, and to giue him pre|&s;ents, which were a Ba&s;on &amp; Ewer of &s;iluer, a &s;tand|ing

Fir&s;t at the Ge|nerals landing, the Flemmings mette him and car|ried him to their hou&s;e, where he &s;tayed vntill the King &s;ent for him: In the meane while there came a Noble-man called <HI>Curcon,</HI> who would haue receiued her Maie&s;ties letter to haue deliue|red it to the King, but our Generall refu&s;ed to de|liuer it to any, but to the King him&s;elfe. Then did the King &s;end &s;ixe Elephants for the Generall and his attendants, whereof there was one Elephant which was the greate&s;t that carried a Cannopie couered with Redde cloath, in which Cannopie was a peece of Silke, and a peece of cloath of gold to carrie her Maie&s;ties letter in, and vpon this Elephant none did ride but he that carried the let|ter. The Generall ridde vppon another with a guide before him, and vppon the re&s;t &s;ome did ride and &s;ome did not, for it is very vnea&s;ie riding vppon them, their backes are &s;o broade, and they &s;o great and tall.</P>
<P>The King did likewi&s;e &s;end his Trumpets and other Mu&s;icke which played before the Generall to the Courte, and there was twentie other that carried &s;treamers of &s;ilke of diuers coulours, ac|cording to that countrie manner. So the Gene|rall entering into the fir&s;t gate of the Court re&s;ted
<PB N="15" REF="9">him&s;elfe there, vntill the King had notice of his comming, who pre&s;ently &s;ent for him, and foure other of the principall men about the Generall, who when they had brought him to the King, came backe for the pre&s;ents, which were car|ryed in by the Marchants appointed for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And after they had pa&s;&s;ed three courtes, they came into a place couered with Cannopies, ad|ioyning to the Kings Gallerie, where the King &s;atte, and after they had giuen <HI>Doulat</HI> to the King, and the King re&s;aluted them according to their Countrie fa&s;hion, which is by lifting both their handes aboue their heads, they &s;atte downe to dinner, where they had great cheere, and to the number of two or three hundreth &s;e|uerall di&s;hes of meate, baked, roa&s;ted, and boy|led: The Di&s;hes and Cuppes wherein they were &s;erued, were mo&s;t of goulde, and of a mettall much like to Bell mettall, which is dea|rer then goulde, euery di&s;he couered, &s;ome with <HI>Pur&s;lain</HI> of <HI>China.</HI> Their drinke is called <HI>Aracke,</HI> and is verye &s;trong, and is not to bee drunke without water, yet that which is gene|rally drunke in the countrie is nothing &s;o &s;trong, nor &s;o whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The King asked our Generall if our Queene were married, &amp; how long &s;he had raigned, which when the Generall had an&s;wered by his interpre|tor, the King wondred. The King likewi&s;e told the
<PB N="16" REF="10">Generall, if the words in her Maie&s;ties letter came from the hart, he had cau&s;e to thinke well thereof. Dinner being ended, the King cau&s;ed his Dam&s;els to daunce, and his women to play Mu&s;icke vnto them, who were richly adorned with Bracelets and Iewels, and this was a great fauour: for hee dooth not v&s;ually let them be &s;eene to any. The King did likewi&s;e giue vnto our Generall a fine white Roabe, and a Tucke, imbrodered with gold very ritchly: al&s;o a great Girdell and two Cri&s;es, all which one of his Noble-men put on in the Kings pre&s;ence, and in this manner hee departed the Court and went aboord; and the King &s;ent him aboorde a Bullocke, and great &s;tore of fre&s;h fi&s;h. So that to conclude, he did receiue hir Maie|&s;ties letter with great kindne&s;&s;e, and entertained our Generall with greater &s;tate then hee is accu|&s;tomed to doe to other nations, as wee might per|ceiue by diuers Emba&s;&s;adors that came thether while&s;t we were there.</P>
<P>The 5. of Iune Captaine <HI>Pope</HI> went a &s;hoare for one of our men which was le&s;t in the towne all night by his owne negligence, for the Gene|rall did feare becau&s;e hee &s;poake <HI>Portugale,</HI> and that there were <HI>Portingalls</HI> in the towne, that hee might make knowne vnto them &s;ome-thing which might bee preiudiciall to the Fleete, Mai&s;ter <HI>Pope</HI> dined this day with the King, who gaue him a Heyffer to carrie aboorde with him.</P>

<P>About this time one <HI>Thorougood</HI> in our Admi|rall was araigned, and found guiltie of mutiny and comtempe, and therefore was condemned to bee hanged; but by great intreaty he was forgi|uen.</P>
<P>The 13. day the Generall went to the young Prince, which dwelleth halfe a mile from his fa|ther, and the Generall gaue him a peece of plate, A paire of hangers and a &s;worde, the Prince enter|tained him kindely, gaue him a roabe and a cri|&s;es, and gaue vnto them which came in with him ruckes of callico Lawne.</P>
<P>The 17. day of Iune, one <HI>Curcon</HI> a principall man in that countrie &amp; diuers others, came aboord our &s;hips to &s;ee them, but e&s;pecially to &s;ee the <HI>Su|&s;an,</HI> whom the Generall had offered to the King to &s;ell, for a certaine quantity of Pepper, but could

<P>The 19. day the Admirall receiued a boates la|ding of Pepper which was the fir&s;t was bought, the price was 64.

<P>During the time we were at <HI>Dachem</HI> the King de&s;ired to haue our Pinnace goe to Pedeir, accom|panyed with a Portugalles frigat, to take if they might rouers at &s;ea, which did rob his &s;ubiectes, and did &s;end to the valew of 100.

Therefore the Generall would haue giuen the King that mony againe but hee would not receiue it by any meanes, &s;aying what hee gaue, he gaue, and would not take a|gaine.</P>
<P>And at the &s;ame time there was &s;euen or eight hundred hou&s;es burnt at &s;undry times in <HI>Dachem</HI> while we were there.</P>

<P>The 24. daye of Iune there came into the road of <HI>Dachem</HI> a Flemmi&s;h Pinnace which had lo&s;t her Admiral, of which Fleete one <HI>Spilbacke</HI> of Middle-bourough was Generall, &s;hee was of the burthen of fifty tunne, and had but three men and two boyes in her, which Pinnace our General bought, for they mi&s;tru&s;ted they &s;hould not heare of their Generall againe.</P>
<P>There came al&s;o into the roade of <HI>Daehem</HI> a great &s;hippe of Saint Mallos in Fraunce of the burthen of foure hundred tunne.

<P>The 11. day of September, our <HI>Admiral, vice Admi|rall, Rear Admirall,</HI> &amp; the flemi&s;h &s;hip and Pinnace departed hence for the &s;traightes of <HI>Malacca</HI> our generall dangerou&s;ly &s;icke.

<P>The 3. day of October, being in the &s;traites of <HI>Mallacca</HI> the <HI>Hector</HI> e&s;pyed a great &s;hip towardes e|uening which came from S. <HI>Thoma,</HI> &amp; was bound for <HI>Malacca,</HI> and the next morning yeelded them|&s;elues without any re&s;i&s;tance, or &s;o much as any one man hurt, this day we beganne to vnlade her, and had out of hir 950. packes of Calico, and Pen|tadoes, be&s;ides many great che&s;tes with Marchan|di&s;e, all which was vpon her orlops, But her hould was full of Rice, and becau&s;e of a &s;torme, that did ari&s;e we were forced to leaue hir with that great aboundance of Rice, and with &s;tore of victuals as Porke, Butter, Chee&s;e, Ruske, con&s;erues, &s;uc|kets, hens in pickle, hens pre&s;erued with &s;tore of Sinamon water, and palmeto Wine: the name of

And in 6. dayes we had di&s;char|ged her of the be&s;t of her lading, and would haue taken more if we had had time and place. Thus our fleete returning to <HI>Dachin</HI> the 28 of October, our Generall gaue order, for the &s;hipping as well of &s;uch Marchandi&s;e as came out of England and was vn&s;ould, as al&s;o all &s;uch Pepper, and Sinna|mon as was bought in the ab&s;ence of the fleete, and made what &s;peede po&s;&s;ible might bee for our departures thence.

The people are verye &s;ubtill and cunning in bargai|ning, and vncon&s;tant in all their wordes, for they will &s;ell one thing to diuers men, and take earne&s;t of them all; and if another will giue any thing more, he &s;hall haue it.

There is great &s;tore of Hennes, Buffles and Bul|lockes, yet very deare, a Henne at nine pence or twelue pence, Buffels at two Tayes and a halfe, which is thirtie &s;hillings &s;tarling, Egges, eighteene or twentie for nine pence: and at our comming away, foureteene for nine pence: Rice is brought from other places thether, as good Marchandize, and is &s;olde by the <HI>Bambue,</HI> &s;ixe or &s;eauen <HI>Bambues</HI> for nine pence, euery <HI>Bambue</HI> being an Ale quarte; So that in this place there is neither marchandize nor any thing el&s;e good cheape of it &s;elfe, the
