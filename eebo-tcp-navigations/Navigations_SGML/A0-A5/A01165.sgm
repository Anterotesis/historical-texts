</ARGUMENT>
<P>_AS the wauering and interchaungeable cour&s;e, whereto euery thing what&s;oeuer is continually &s;ubiect, hath beene alwayes heretofore dayly ob&s;erued, in the mo&s;t auncient, and renowmed Monarchies that euer were. So hath it appea|red in the&s;e latter dayes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Kingdomes and &s;tates ful of change and mutabilitie in this age.</NOTE> and that in a more liue|ly maner, in the &s;trange and wonderfull altera|tions of our neighbor countryes: who&s;e peace and pro&s;perous e&s;tate, as it was the common ob|iect of euerie mans eye: &s;o are their vnfortunate warres, and wofull mi&s;eries, the v&s;uall &s;ubiect of all mens &s;peach, and nothing is more ly&s;tened after, then to what ende matters of &s;o great waight and importance are likelie&s;t to tend. The mo&s;t noble and renowmed kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> which for &s;o many yeares flowed with milke and honie, and for the temperatene&s;&s;e of the aire, the fertilitie of the &s;oile, the ciuilitie of the Commons, the loyaltie of the Nobilitie, the dignitie and magnificence of the Prince, was accounted the paragon of all Nations, hath e&s;pecially ta&s;ted of this vici&s;situde, and change: which &s;o long as it was at peace with it &s;elfe, and not afflicted with any ciuill di&s;cention, the &s;ubiect honouring the King with all dutifull obedience, and the King tendering the welfare of the &s;ubiect with a hearty and louing affection, and both concurring in one for
<PB N="2" REF="4"> the aduauncement of the Common-wealth, flouri&s;hed in mo&s;t beautifull maner, and appeared verie plea&s;ing to the eye of all Nations round about: but after that it once began to nouri&s;h turbulent &s;pirits, and to harbour &s;trange and vnnaturall humours, the Prince following the daungerous proiects of yong and corrupt councellors, who rather &s;ought their owne priuate gaine, then the publike profite and vtilitie of the &s;tate, and the people beeing ea&s;ily drawne by the per&s;wa&s;ions of their Gouernours to embrace in a maner any noueltie that was propounded: then began the common-wealth to bee intangled in manie daungerous mi&s;chiefes, and to bee encombred with &s;undrie cares, wherewith for this long time it hath beene exceedingly vexed, and tormented. And albeit there hath often bin &s;ome mitigation of paine for a while: and that by the great wi&s;edome and skill of &s;uch as &s;ate at the &s;tearne, and had the managing of the publike affayres, the &s;hip, which was well neare ouerwhelmed with boi&s;terous waues, was &s;afely pre&s;erued from the wracke: yet, as though there were a fatall de&s;tinie, which could not be auoided, it pre&s;ently againe fell vpon the &s;helues, and plunged it &s;elfe a fre&s;h into a va&s;t Ocean of vn&s;peakeable mi&s;eries, wherein it hath continued floting vp and downe for the&s;e many yeares, and at this day is come to that de&s;perate pa&s;&s;e, that although it be neither &s;plit vpon the &s;andes, nor &s;wallowed vp of the fearefull billowes, yet doth it &s;erue as a perfect gla&s;&s;e, to viewe the vn&s;table e&s;tate of the&s;e earthly things: and for an a&s;&s;ured proofe of the variable change, and continuall vici&s;situde in the mo&s;t flowring kingdoms and common-wealthes. Which albeit it doth euidently appeare vnto the eye of euery beholder, yet will it be farre better di&s;cerned, if wee con&s;ider the reignes of &s;undry French Kings, in who&s;e times there hath fallen out mo&s;t &s;trange and admirable accidents, them&s;elues being e&s;peciall occa&s;ions to prooue a mutuall and an alternatiue cour&s;e, in al things what&s;oeuer.</P>

Then appeared the mi&s;ery of the French, and the king him&s;elfe was forthwith in imminent perill, albeit he fought manfully, and was &s;econded with a valiant troupe of French Nobilitie, who did their vttermo&s;t for their owne &s;ecuritie and honor of their country: yet hauing the marque&s;&s;e in his front, and <HI>Antonio de Leua,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France ta|ken pri&s;oner.</NOTE> who was nowe i&s;&s;ued out of <HI>Paua</HI> with al his forces, on his backe, after he had beene &s;ore wearied and greeuou&s;ly wounded, both in the face and hand, and had his hor&s;e killed vnder him, hee was forced to yeelde to fiue common Souldiers which knew him not: but &s;hortly after the Viceroy pa&s;&s;ing by, the king called vnto him, and making him&s;elf knowne, was with great reuerence receiued, as <HI>Cae&s;ars</HI> pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Thus was the French king, who not long before had beene in &s;o flouri&s;hing e&s;tate, commanding not onely ouer al <HI>France,</HI> but al&s;o a great part of <HI>Italy,</HI> being &s;o mightie, rich, and pui&s;&s;ant, that hee was dreaded of all his neighbor princes, &s;ubiected to a maruailous change and alteration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of France &s;ent pri&s;oner into Spaine.</NOTE> being made fir&s;t a pri&s;oner to common &s;ouldiers, and conuaied from one place to another, vntill at length he came into Spaine, hauing left all his army to the mercie of their enemies, who &s;lew of them well neere to the number of 10000. and among them there peri&s;hed twentie of the greate&s;t of the French Nobilitie, as <HI>Boniuet, Chauany, Mon&s;ieur de la pali&s;&s;a, Tremoile, Obigny,</HI> and &s;undry others of e&s;peciall account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The great &s;laughter of the french Nobilitie.</NOTE> as <HI>Henry</HI> the king of <HI>Nauarre, Renee</HI> the ba&s;tard of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> Duke <HI>Memorancy, Francis</HI> of <HI>Burbon</HI> Earle of Saint <HI>Paul, Biron, Imbercourt, Floranges</HI> Colonell of the Swit|zers, with a great number of e&s;peciall account were taken pri&s;oners.

<P>All Europe was mightily di&s;maied with the newes of this victorie, and all e&s;tates beganne to grow iealous of the Emperials greatne&s;&s;e. The Venetians of all others thought them&s;elues mo&s;t neerely touched therewith,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Pope, the Veneti|ans and other potentates, make a league a|gain&s;t the Emperour.</NOTE> and therefore they offered to ioyne with the Pope, and to hire a ten thou&s;and Switzers to de|fende <HI>Italy</HI> again&s;t the Emperials, hoping that the Lady Regent of <HI>France,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> and many other Princes would ioyne with them again&s;t their common enimie. In the meane time the King of <HI>France</HI> was (as is alreadie decla|red) tran&s;ported into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and &s;ent vp into the Ca&s;tle of Madrill. This was no doubt a bitter receipt, and a &s;harpe corro&s;iue to this magnanimous prince, who had not been v&s;ed to be confined in &s;o narrow a roume: but patience with hope was his be&s;t comfort, for the Emperour would not &s;ee him, much le&s;&s;e mini&s;ter any matter of con&s;olation in that his wofull di&s;tre&s;&s;e, neither yet did he &s;eeme to &s;hewe any externall &s;ignes of ioy for &s;o glorious a victorie:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The modera|tion of Charles the fift.</NOTE> he prohi|bited bonefires, ringing of belles, and &s;uch like accu&s;tomed &s;olemnities, &s;aying that it might bee &s;eemely to v&s;e outwarde reioycings for victories again&s;t the Turks, Sarrazins, and other infidels, but not again&s;t chri&s;tian Princes.</P>
<P>The Emperours Councell were long before they could well tell what to do with this pri&s;oner, they beeing di&s;tracted into diuers opinions: but in the ende it was fully concluded to make as great a gaine of him as might bee, and therefore they earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him to yeeld ouer all his claime and title, to <HI>Burgondy, Millan,</HI> and <HI>Naples:</HI> be&s;ides, hee was bound to pay a huge &s;umme of money for his ran&s;ome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The agree|me~t betweene the Emperor and the french King.</NOTE> and to condi&s;cend to &s;undrie other things, and tho&s;e &s;o great, that no man of iudgement thought hee would bee &s;o good as his word. Yet for a&s;&s;urance the King was contented to marry the Lady <HI>Elynor</HI> the Empe|rors &s;i&s;ter, and to grant that his two &s;ons, the Dolphin and the Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> &s;huld be left in ho&s;tage for the better performance of the conditions. Now was <HI>France</HI> brought to a lowe ebbe, and the auncient &s;plendor and glorie thereof mightily ob&s;cured: yea, that renowmed Kingdome, which had beene alwaies accounted the parragon of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and hadde beene a terror vnto the Ro|mane monarchy, &s;ate as a de&s;olate widow that had lo&s;t her husband, in wee|ping, wailing, and great lamentation. But &s;hortly after this afflicted countrey began to bee recomforted, and as it were reuiued, after it had felt the pangs of death, for the king being once &s;et at libertie and gotten into <HI>France,</HI> &s;ollicited o|ther Princes, as the Pope, the king of <HI>England,</HI> the Venetians, and other &s;tates to ioyne with him, and made a &s;trong league, and fell flat out with the emperour afre&s;h, notwith&s;tanding all the promi&s;es which had beene made. Then pre|&s;ently en&s;ued new warres, and all <HI>Europe</HI> was in a &s;ort infected with this conta|gious humor. Fortune which hadde &s;o extreamely cro&s;&s;ed the French de&s;igne|ments, began to be more fauourable, and to beholde the king with a &s;miling countenance, for the Lord <HI>Lautrech</HI> beeing &s;ent into <HI>Italy,</HI> tooke <HI>Bo&s;co, Genes, A|lexandria,</HI> and <HI>Pauia</HI> from the emperour, maruaylou&s;ly aduauncing the French affaires.</P>
<P>The emperour beeing vexed at the heart with the&s;e newes, complained
<PB N="19" REF="13"> greeuou&s;ly of the king, offering him the Combate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Empe|rour offereth the combate to the french King.</NOTE> calling him for&s;worne and periured prince; the King gaue him the lie, and affirmed that hee would make it good vpon his body, when and where he dur&s;t. Thus did the&s;e mightie po|tentates fight a farre off with their tongues, and their armies in <HI>Italy,</HI> and other where &s;ought to ruinate and ouerthrow each other by all po&s;&s;ible meanes. Af|ter many conflicts, wherein &s;ometime the emperials, and &s;ometime the French as it were alternatiuely had the better, there was a peace concluded for tenne yeeres: in which time the Emperour in very freendly and louing manner,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A peace be|tweene the Emperor and the French King.</NOTE> pa&s;|&s;ed through <HI>France,</HI> to repre&s;&s;e certaine tumultuous outrages committed in <HI>Flanders.</HI> This peace beeing expired, they fell again into new broyles, but they were &s;oone ended: and nowe began <HI>France</HI> to bee &s;courged with the Engli&s;h, who hauing gotten <HI>Bulloigne,</HI> wa&s;ted their countrey round about.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene of Hungary leuieth an army to in|uade France</NOTE>The Queene of <HI>Hungary</HI> the Emperours &s;i&s;ter, vnder&s;tanding of the retreat of the French, deui&s;ed all the meanes that might bee to impeach them, and to cut of as many as &s;hee could catch at any aduantage: and hauing leauied an army to the number of twelue thou&s;and footmen, &amp; three thou&s;and hor&s;e, vnder the leading of the Count <HI>Man&s;feild</HI> and <HI>Martyn Vauro&s;h,</HI> entered the faire fields of the <HI>Flower de Lys,</HI> which they &s;poyled verie pittiou&s;ly.

<P>The Duke of <HI>Alua</HI> was &s;ent before, with the choi&s;e&s;t of the emperiall armie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;iege of Metz.</NOTE> who pa&s;sing the riuer of <HI>Seille,</HI> emcamped as neare the towne as he could, and be&s;towed &s;undry of his forces in the &s;tronge&s;t forts adioyning. The Spani&s;h companies were lodged at Saint <HI>Arnold,</HI> and Saint <HI>Clement.</HI> Certaine troupes of the Almaines were placed at a Bridge called <HI>Magny.

All things beeing in a readine&s;&s;e, the emperials beganne to beate the Towne with their great Ordinance, in verie furious &s;ort, and in all ho&s;tile maner to annoy the defen|dants. The batterie continued long, and yet the harme was but &s;mall, neither could the breach be made &s;ufficient for an a&s;&s;ault. Whereupon they remoued the Canon to another part of the Citie. And falling to mining, &s;uppo&s;ed to o|uerthrow &s;ome peece of the wall with Gunpowder. But the Duke of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> vnder&s;tanding the drift of his enemyes, cau&s;ed countermynes to bee made, wherein they had not trauailed long, but they might heare the noy&s;e and &s;tirring of the Spaniardes, and &s;o were theyr deui&s;es ea&s;ily preuented.

<P>This &s;atisfied them for the time, and made them to tempori&s;e, &amp; expect their better fortune.

<P><MILESTONE N="1558"> By this time was the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> come out of <HI>Italie,</HI> and being made the Kings Lieutenant, was &s;ent with a &s;trong power toward <HI>Amiens,</HI> with a &s;ecret commandeme~t to enterpri&s;e again&s;t <HI>Calice,</HI> if occa&s;ion &s;erued.

The duke hauing gotten two principal places, &amp; that in one day, planted his battery again&s;t the towne, wher|in was gouernor the L.

The duke hauing planted 15. Canons, began his battery again&s;t the old ca&s;tle, &amp; that with great fury.

This was a very great lo&s;&s;e to the Engli&s;h, for that from thence the French might &s;hoote into the towne at their plea&s;ure</P>

<P>Now was <HI>Calice</HI> narrowly be&s;ieged, and all pa&s;&s;ages were &s;topped in &s;uch &s;ort, that it was impo&s;sible to conuay in any &s;uccours, or to &s;end forth any to giue aduerti&s;ement of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed e&s;tate of the inhabitants. Which when the Lord Wentworth perceiued, and how that for want of nece&s;&s;aries, he was not able to keepe the towne any longer, he was content to parle with the Duke, and to yeeld vpon compo&s;ition. Whereto the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> willingly a&s;&s;ented: &s;o that after much debating on either &s;ide the towne was yelded vpon condition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calice yeel|ded to the D. of Gui&s;e.</NOTE> that the inhabitants might &s;afely depart without impeachment whither they li|&s;ted, and the lord Wentworth with diuer&s;e others to the number of fiftie of the chiefe&s;t, to remaine pri&s;oners.</P>

Which when the garri&s;on of <HI>Hams</HI> vnder&s;tood, they abandoned the fort, &amp; withdrew them&s;elues to a place of greater &s;ecuritie. The French king was not a little ioyfull to heare the&s;e newes: wherefore longing to &s;ee that, which he had &s;o often wi&s;hed and de&s;ired, he po&s;ted pre&s;ently to vi&s;it his new conquered towne: whither he was no &s;ooner come, but that he gaue order for the repairing and fortifying thereof, and leauing <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Thermes</HI> gouernor, withdrew him&s;elfe againe towards <HI>Paris,</HI> commanding the <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> to be&s;iege <HI>Herbemont,</HI> a place of &s;ome importance: which was yeelded at the fir&s;t &s;ummance.

<PB N="39" REF="23"> and through the horrible per&s;ecutions of tho&s;e whom they termed <HI>Hu|gonots,</HI> maruellou&s;ly decayed and weakned, by rea&s;on of a &s;ecret diui&s;ion bred in the hearts of infinit multitudes, who once di&s;&s;enting in Religion, could ne|uer after well agree in matters of &s;tate: yet was the land at peace within it &s;elfe, and euery one &s;eemed to be enclinable to their princes plea&s;ure, choo&s;ing ra|ther to endure any affliction, then by &s;eeking to defend their liues and liberties by force of armes, to bring in any inte&s;tine warres, the mo&s;t deuouring plague and &s;harpe&s;t puni&s;hment of all other: but after that the hou&s;e of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> began to rule, and that their factious deui&s;es cloaked with a zeale of mainteining the Ca|tholicke cau&s;e, had once &s;tirred the coales, the flame pre&s;ently brake foorth, and finding conuenient matter to nouri&s;h it withall, &s;pread it &s;elfe in a &s;hort time ouer the face of the whole kingdome of <HI>France,</HI> to the con&s;uming of in|finite multitudes of all &s;orts, and the extreame impoueri&s;hing of the whole land.</P>
<P>There were &s;undry and diuers meanes to ha&s;ten this &s;o wonderfull and la|mentable alteration in <HI>France,</HI> but the principall of all other, was the vnexpec|ted death of t e late King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene mother, the King of Na|uarre and the Duke of Guy&s;e, con|tend for the gouernment during the noneage of the King.</NOTE> who albeit hee verie &s;euerely puni&s;hed all &s;uch as were accounted Prote&s;tants, and that principally at the in&s;tigation of the hou&s;e of <HI>Guy&s;e,</HI> yet did he &s;o politikely carry him&s;elfe, that during his raigne, he kept that ambitious mon&s;ter in &s;ome rea&s;onable good order, and the whole lande from tumult and rebellion: but he was no &s;ooner dead, but that all things be|ganne to ha&s;ten to a confu&s;ion, and the whole common wealth to bee daun|gerou&s;ly infected with &s;undry fearefull di&s;ea&s;es, the originall whereof aro&s;e in this maner.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the reigne of <HI>Francis</HI> the &s;econd, being but &s;ixteene yeares olde, there grewe a controuer&s;ie betweene <HI>Katherin de Medices</HI> the Kings mother, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Burbon</HI> King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and <HI>Francis</HI> of <HI>Lorraigne,</HI> Duke of <HI>Guy&s;e,</HI> touching the gouernment of the young King during his non|age. The Queene-mother alleaged many rea&s;ons to &s;trengthen her claime, as the lawes of Nature, which would that the mother &s;hould haue the brin|ging vp of her children, as one hauing a mo&s;t tender care ouer them, and mo&s;t willing of all others to doo them good, the cu&s;tomes and v&s;ages of &s;undry na|tions, and the auncient order of the lande, which made the mother <HI>Gardien</HI> of her childe: and &s;o by con&s;equent gaue her the Regency of the kingdome. The king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> on the contrary affirmed, that he ought in right to be gouernour of the young king, for that he was the next Prince of the blood, and neare&s;t of kinne vnto him: be&s;ides that there were fundamentall lawes of that nation, which did not only &s;hut out all &s;traungers, (by whom he vn|der&s;tood the hou&s;e of <HI>Lorraine</HI> and of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI>): but al&s;o di&s;abled the Queene mo|ther, by rea&s;on of her &s;exe, which the <HI>Salique</HI> lawe did expre&s;ly exclude from all regency, and &s;ucce&s;sion to the Crowne. The Duke of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> had al&s;o di|uers rea&s;ons for the aduauncing of his owne title, as that hee was the kinges vncle: that by his &s;eruice the whole &s;tate had bene in a maner mainteined, and the land from &s;undry imminent perilles deliuered. Be&s;ides he excepted in a &s;ort again&s;t the king of <HI>Nauarre:</HI> for that hee and his brother the Prince of <HI>Condy,</HI> gaue euident tokens of their liking of the Go&s;pel, and their hatred of
<PB N="40" REF="24"> the Romi&s;h Religion: &s;o that if <HI>Nauarre</HI> &s;houlde haue the gouernement of the King, it was to bee feared (&s;aide hee) that the whole lande would fall into here&s;ie.</P>
<P>Thus did the&s;e three contende with might and maine for the &s;uperio|rite, each of them deui&s;ing al the rea&s;ons they could imagine for the furtherance of their cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But in the ende, the Queene Mother, and the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> doub|ting that they &s;houlde not bee able nor &s;ufficient to preuaile, and al&s;o fea|ring lea&s;t that the King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> (by rea&s;on of the great preheminence and authoritie that the princes of the blood &s;houlde by right haue, be&s;ides his iu&s;t tytle) &s;houlde in the ende preuayle and get the better agayn&s;t them both, thought it be&s;t to ioyne togither agayn&s;t the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Queene mother, and D. of Gui&s;e, ioine togither again&s;t Na|uarre.</NOTE> and eyther by force, or by policie and fayre meanes to winne him vnto their willes, and by &s;ome deui&s;e or other to make him &s;urcea&s;e from his iu&s;t claime, and intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The better to effect this, the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> &s;ey&s;ed vppon the king, whome hee conducted and brought to the <HI>Louure</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> with the yong Princes his Brethren, and with the two Queenes, leauing the Princes of the blood, the Cone&s;table, the Mare&s;chall, the Admirall, and &s;undrie other noble and great per&s;onages attending vpon the dead Corps of the late king <HI>Henrie.</HI></P>
<P>When they hadde preuailed in their purpo&s;e thus farre, then was there &s;uch watch and warde kept about the King, that no man might &s;peake vnto him, but in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome of the Guy&s;es: and the matter was &s;o well handled in the ende, that the Cardinall and the Duke of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> ruled and go|uourned all things, and hadde the king in a manner at their will and comman|dement.</P>
<P>Then beganne they to bring into the kings Councell men of their owne faction, and to procure the kinges di&s;plea&s;ure vnto &s;uch as they di&s;liked. The rulers and gouernours of the Citties, Townes, and Prouinces were at their appointment: the Princes of the bloud were imployed in bu&s;ines far from the Court.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Flanders</HI> to treate of the league made betweene <HI>Fraunce</HI> and <HI>Spaine:</HI> the king of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Cardinall of <HI>Burbon,</HI> and the Prince <HI>De la Roch &s;ur Yon</HI> were &s;ent to conduct the kings Si&s;ter into <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>There were many deui&s;es and fetches to mooue the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> to giue ouer his claime and title which hee made to the Regencie of the young King, and many faire promi&s;es were procured out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> conditionally that he would &s;o doo.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The proude letters of the K. of Spaine.</NOTE>And among others there were letters &s;ent to that purpo&s;e, wherein the Spani&s;h king promi&s;ed that if he would be ruled herein, he would re&s;tore him the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> of which he held nothing but the title auerring fur|ther, &amp; that very imperiou&s;ly, &amp; with threatening words, that if he did other|wi&s;e, he would take vpon him the protection of his brother in law him&s;elf, and
<PB N="41" REF="24"> &s;pend all that euer he had, yea, his owne life and the liues of fortie thou&s;and o|thers, whom he had in a readine&s;&s;e in maintaining the quarrell.</P>
<P>Thus partly with faire promi&s;es, and partly with threats, the King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> began to be cold, and in a manner quiet, and cleane to giue ouer the matter.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king of Nauarre giueth ouer his claime.</NOTE> When the <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> perceiued this, then did he proceede further, hauing the coun|tenance of the yong King, and being backed &s;o &s;trongly with the Spani&s;h king, &s;o that nowe hee put out and in whome hee li&s;ted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The pride of Guy&s;e.</NOTE> and incroched vppon the offices of other men&punc; hee would not &s;ticke to meddle with the Cone&s;table&s;hip and great mai&s;ter of <HI>France,</HI> arrogating that vnto him&s;elfe which of right be|longed vnto others. The high courts of Parliament were full of his followers, and whom &s;oeuer he &s;u&s;pected not to fauour his de&s;ignes, the&s;e were by &s;ome one &s;ini&s;ter information or other, pre&s;ently di&s;graced, in&s;omuch as tho&s;e fewe good men that were in place, con&s;idering the rough handling, and &s;euere v|&s;age of &s;undry well affected per&s;ons, and the &s;mall good that en&s;ued by com|plaining vnto the King were content to be &s;ilent, and not to meddle in &s;uch dangerous times.</P>
<P>The Cardinall of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> was appoynted ouer the Kings finances: the Duke of <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> brother was made Lieutenant generall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Card<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|nall of Guy&s;e made Lorde trea&s;urer, and the duke his brother Lieutenant generall for the King.</NOTE> and had the direction of all matters appertaining vnto the warres, and all Captaines, gouernors of townes, and other officers were commanded to obey him, as the King him&s;elfe. Thus hadde the&s;e two gotten the &s;ole authoritie into their hands, and although the Queene mother was at the fir&s;t the meanes to procure them &s;o great place, and to make them &s;o neere about the king, yet not long after &s;hee repented her thereof, and &s;ought many waies to curb them, and to keepe them as &s;hort as &s;hee might: yet &s;hee beeing a mo&s;t vncertaine and incon&s;tant woman, and e|uer inclining to the wor&s;t, &s;till rather held with them, then with the princes of the bloud, who beganne to waxe wearie of the intollerable pride of the <HI>Guy&s;e,</HI> and the burning, murthering, and iniurious dealing of that bloudy hou&s;e. The <HI>Guy&s;e</HI> no &s;ooner &s;u&s;pected that their hearts were alienated, but that hee &s;tudied day and night howe to ouerthrow them, and to cau&s;e the King to embrew his handes in the bloud of his owne kinred. While the&s;e mi&s;chiefes were thus in platting, and many outragious parts plaied tending to the &s;trengthening of this factious hou&s;e, and the vtter ouerthrow of the ancient Nobilitie of <HI>France,</HI> in|finite multitudes grewe maruailous di&s;contented, and both by word and wri|ting &s;hewed theyr mi&s;like of the pre&s;ent gouernement, exclaiming again&s;t the &s;ore per&s;ecutions of tho&s;e of the reformed Religion, and the intollerable wronges and iniuries offered vnto &s;undrie of the Kings be&s;t affected &s;ubiects.</P>
<P>There were many &s;upplications pre&s;ented vnto the Queene mother, to the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and others of greate&s;t place &amp; authoritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Guy&s;e &s;etteth the King again&s;t the princes of the bloud.</NOTE> tending to the refor|mation of the&s;e mi&s;eries, but they were little or nothing regarded: for the Queene mother fauoured not the Prote&s;tants in her heart, though often in the beginning made &s;ome &s;hewe thereof, and gaue &s;ome helpe to the per&s;ecuted Hugonots. The King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> was timorous, and would not pro&s;ecute the cau&s;e with &s;uch a courage as hee ought to haue done: be&s;ides, hee was be&s;ot|ted with the per&s;wa&s;ions of regaining the kingdome of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> if hee would &s;till remaine a Catholike: which conceiued hope &s;o &s;tacke in his mind and made

This barbarous v&s;age of &s;o many natural Frenchmen, &amp; outragious crueltie towardes all &s;orts, bred by little &amp; little a commi&s;eration in the hearts of &s;undry, in whom there remained &s;ome &s;parks of humanitie, &s;o that banding together &amp; oppo&s;ing them&s;elues a|gain&s;t the proceedings of that time, they endeuored by al po&s;&s;ible meanes to reforme the common wealth, &amp; reduce the decaied e&s;tate to &s;ome better order: and albeit that &s;undrie per&s;onages had &s;hewed their liking of a reformation, as the K. of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> the cone&s;table, the Admirall, <HI>Dandelot,</HI> &amp; many others, yet no man attempted, but &s;trained courte&s;ie (as it were) who &s;hould begin: which procra&s;tinating &s;undry of good place not beeing able to endure any longer, combined them&s;elues together, hauing for the principall and ringleader of their actions, one called <HI>Godfray de Berry,</HI> Lord of <HI>Renaudy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord of Renaudy with &s;undry others atte~pt again&s;t the Guy&s;e.</NOTE> a wi&s;e, valiant &amp; wel experienced Gentleman, who notwith&s;tanding wi hout the adui&s;e of &s;ix coun&s;ellers, and 20. captaines, might not attempt any thing.</P>
<P>This companie con&s;i&s;ting of meere polliticks in the beginning, and &s;uch as &s;ought for nothing but a reformation in the common weale, were in proce&s;&s;e of time a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a multitude of tho&s;e who were tearmed Hugonots (as it is the maner of di&s;contented per&s;ons, how different &s;o euer the occa&s;ion be, to ioyne rogether in hope of fortunes accidents) who allied them&s;elues with the re&s;t, the more willingly, for that it was in a ciuill cau&s;e, and &s;uch a thing as tended to the honour of the King, and generall good of the whole &s;tate.</P>

<P>Being thus prouided, they foorthwith apprehended &s;uch as they &s;u&s;pected, and proceeded again&s;t them with all rigour.

<P>Albeit <HI>Nauarre</HI> did not beleeue this, yet as one loath to rai&s;e new &s;tirs, he was content to tempori&s;e &amp; di&s;&s;emble the matter, &s;uppo&s;ing in deed, that now their pride was abated, and that they would no more carrie them&s;elues &s;o hautily as they had done in times pa&s;t.

<P>But lea&s;t <HI>Nauarre</HI> and his a&s;&s;ociates &s;hould bee too much di&s;contented with this cro&s;&s;e dealing, it was thought good to practi&s;e &s;ome newe attonement betweene them and the <HI>Gui&s;es,</HI> and to declare <HI>Nauarre</HI> the kings lieutenant ge|nerall throughout all his dominions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of Nauarre made lieute|nant generall for the king.</NOTE> which was accompli&s;hed by the meanes of the Cone&s;table: &s;o that now <HI>Nauarre</HI> was highly honoured, and the <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> made Court vnto him.

But while he was thus in his ruffe, firmely per&s;wading him&s;elfe that all was his, bebold, there fell out a &s;traunge and vnexpected accident, which brake the necke of all his deui&s;es.</P>
<P>There was a poore Gentleman named <HI>Iohn Poltrot,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;torie of Poltot that killed the Duke of Gui&s;e.</NOTE> one of verie little &s;ta|ture, but full of &s;pirite and lyfe, and generally reputed of &s;uch as be&s;t knewe him, to bee &s;omewhat a ra&s;h headed fellow, and verie vndi&s;creete, and one that dur&s;t attempt any thing. Who being brought vp for a long time in <HI>Spaine,</HI> had learned the language verie perfectly: And for that both for his colour, complection, and &s;tature, he was &s;o like vnto them of that nation, he was com|monly called the little Spaniard.</P>
<P>This fellow &s;eruing &s;ometime vnder <HI>Soubize,</HI> who commaunded at <HI>Lyons,</HI> woulde often vaunt, that this was the hande (&s;tretching out his arme) that &s;houlde kill the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> and deliuer <HI>Fraunce</HI> from that mon&s;trous and cruell Tyrant.

<P>The Admyrall lyking the man well for his diligence, and &s;ecrecie in mat|ters of &s;uch importaunce, gaue him an hundred Crownes, and bidde him buy him a good Hor&s;e, that hee might with more celeritie di&s;patch his bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e. With this money <HI>Poltrot</HI> bought him a verie excellent Spani&s;h Genet, and leauing the Admirall, went backe to the <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> Campe, where he away|ted &s;ome oportunitie to put in execution his intended purpo&s;e.

And hauing ridden all that night by by-wayes, for feare of tho&s;e who pur&s;ued him, he not knowing which way he went, wandred vp and downe, &amp; in the end came againe almo&s;t to the place where hee committed the fact. Which when he perceiued, he rode all the day folowing, with as much &s;peed as po&s;sibly might be, to get out of the danger of his pur&s;uing enemies. But hauing with continuall trauell wearied both him&s;elfe and his hor&s;e, he re&s;ted at a farm hou&s;e, where he was taken vpon &s;u&s;pition, and committed to &s;afe keeping for his further triall.

<P>This &s;udden blow did maruellou&s;ly di&s;may the Catholikes, and the rather for that it appeared to be deadly, and not po&s;sible to be healed: For he waxed wor&s;e euerie day then other, and died very &s;hortly after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Duke of Gui&s;e died within &s;euen or eight daies after his hurt</NOTE> to their vn&s;peakable greefe: who had repo&s;ed their whole confidence in him, and to the great reioycing of the confederates, who&s;e deadly &amp; &s;worne enemies he was alwayes accounted.

Hee therefore with the a&s;&s;ent of his a&s;&s;ociats, &s;pread abroade diuers calumniations, and &s;landerous rumours of tho&s;e of the reformed Religion, &amp; being a gratious man with the Queen mother, for that their humors were but too agreeable and con&s;onant each to other, he per&s;wa|ded with her, that if &s;hee &s;hould countenance the cheefe Princes and Lords of the Religion, and &s;uffer them to be neere the Court, and beare a &s;way in mat|ters of State, they would draw on many followers after them, and peraduen|ture gaine the yong King and the Princes his brethren to be their friends, and then <HI>Conde</HI> being a man of courage and of that proximitie in bloud would looke to haue his place: which if hee might peaceably enioy, her authoritie would be quickly in the du&s;t, and the Burbons, Memorancies, and Cha&s;tillons would rule all: and as it was mo&s;t likely, &s;hee &s;hould bee called to an account for her former gouernement, during the Kings nonage: and by drawing on the hatred of the Catholikes, of the Pope, and of the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> loo&s;e al her credit and reputation.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>_BY the narration of that which is alreadie pa&s;t, euery one may vnder&s;tand the enterchangeable cour&s;e, and vici&s;situde, both of the Catholike and Prote&s;tant affaires. <MILESTONE N="1574"> And that as well the one as the other, had &s;ufficient tryall, of the ebbing and flow|ing of their fortune. Now let vs &s;ee, if after &s;o great experience of their daily calamities, brought forth and nouri&s;hed by rea|&s;on of their ciuill di&s;&s;entions, they waxed any wi&s;er, or more warie how to preuent future mi&s;chiefs.</P>
<P>Although that many, as well Prote&s;tants, as Papi&s;ts, were very glad of this late reconciliation, and with ioyfull hearts thanked the King for their de&s;ired peace: yet tho&s;e of <HI>Quercie, Languedocke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tho&s;e of Quercy and Languedock, refu&s;e the peace.</NOTE> and (in a worde) all the Prouinces to|wards the Leuant &s;eas, were not &s;atisfied therewith: for that (&s;aid they) their enemies, and the authours of tho&s;e execrable Pari&s;ian murthers, were &s;till the Kings principal fauourits, and neare&s;t about his per&s;on: and therfore they were little a&s;&s;ured of any &s;ecurity, but rather had cau&s;e to feare an other ma&s;&s;acre, con|&s;idering the king was ruled by &s;uch bad coun&s;el. And further, that there had bin many as &s;trong Edicts, and as &s;olemnly &s;worn as that at <HI>Rochel,</HI> and yet they pro|ued but wordes without effect, and &s;erued but as nets to catch the poore Pro|te&s;tants: that with fraudulent and &s;ubtile deui&s;es, they had euer preuailed more then by open force: and therfore now it &s;tood them vpon (after &s;o much &s;choo|ling) to take better heed vnto them&s;elues, &amp; to beware of the practi&s;es of tho&s;e, who thir&s;ted for nothing &s;o much as for their blood, and the vtter aboli&s;hing of their Religion, which they had for many yeares maintained with the daunger of their liues: adding withall, that this la&s;t pacification was made but with &s;ome particulars, without their con&s;ent, and therfore that they were not bound to keepe it, further then they liked of it.</P>
<P>The&s;e and the like rea&s;ons were alledged by a great number of the Confede: rats, who hauing bin often deceiued, would not now &s;o readily giue eare vnto faire promi&s;es, but meant to &s;tand vpon their gards, and as warily as might be, to watch the Catholikes at euery turne. And to the intent they might the better maintaine their reputation, and with greater dexteritie manage their affayres, they fir&s;t a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Millaua</HI> in <HI>Rouergne,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The a&s;&s;embly of the Pro|te&s;tants.</NOTE> and afterwards at <HI>Montaubau,</HI> where after long and mature deliberation, they e&s;tabli&s;hed an orderly cour&s;e for the re&s;t of their proceedings.

<P>Great preparation was made by the King, to with&s;tand the&s;e proceedings, and proclamation was &s;ent out into all parts to a&s;&s;emble the <HI>Bannes</HI> and <HI>Arierbannes,</HI> and &s;uch was the diligence v&s;ed herein, that there was quickely gathered toge|ther a &s;ufficient number to make two armyes, which the King pre&s;ently diui|ded, &s;ending the one into <HI>Poictou,</HI> vnder the conduct of <HI>Montpencier,</HI> again&s;t <HI>La Noue,</HI> and the other vnder the leading of <HI>Mategnon</HI> into <HI>Bas Normandie,</HI> agayn&s;t the Count <HI>Mongommerie,</HI> who preuayled mightily again&s;t the Catholiques, &s;ei|&s;ing vpon &s;undry their be&s;t townes, and &s;tronge&s;t holds, and raunging euery where at his plea&s;ure.

<P>_THe French King,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>1588</HI> The army of the Germains commaunded by the Duke of Bonillon.</NOTE> and Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> were all this while verie bu&s;ie in prouiding of all nece&s;&s;arie meanes to with&s;tande the Germaines, who &s;till came on forwardes. Their armie con|&s;i&s;ted of fiue thou&s;and Ruttars, fiue thou&s;and Lancequenets, &s;ixteene thou&s;and Switzers, with whom were ioyned foure thou&s;and French harquebuziers, and three hundred French hor&s;e. The Lord <HI>Mouy</HI> brought al&s;o two thou&s;and French harquebuziers on hor&s;ebacke, the Lord <HI>Villeneufe</HI> one thou&s;and, and the Lorde <HI>Louers</HI> one thou&s;and. The Lord <HI>Chastillon</HI> likewi&s;e ioined with them, with one thou&s;and fiue hundred harquebuziers, and two hundred hor&s;es. The whole number came to &s;ome thirtie fiue thou&s;and: be&s;ides the companies brought by the Prince of <HI>Contie.</HI> They had &s;ixteene peeces of great Ordinance, with &s;tore of all warlike munition. The general of all the&s;e, was the Duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> who commaunded as Lieutenant for the King of <HI>Nauarre.</HI></P>
<P>This mightie and puy&s;&s;ant armie was the terrour of the League, and the hope of the Prote&s;tants, but the expectation of both was di&s;appoynted: for after that the Germaines had marched through <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and were gotten in|to <HI>Fraunce</HI> as farre as <HI>Lancy</HI> in <HI>Ma&s;conois,</HI> where by rea&s;on that manie principall Captaines were corrupted with money and fayre promi&s;es, and the re&s;t &s;uffe|red great wants, they concluded to returne backe: &s;o that hauing made their capitulation, and gotten theyr Pa&s;&s;eportes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sundry of the Germaine Captains cor|rup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by mo+ny cau&s;ed the whole armie to retire.

The Duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> generall of that armie, with the Lord <HI>Clerebant</HI> and <HI>Van,</HI> being not able to draw them forwards by any per&s;wa&s;ion, returned to <HI>Ge|neua,</HI> where they died &s;hortly after: The Count <HI>de La Marke,</HI> brother to the duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> was decea&s;ed long before at a place called <HI>Loyne.</HI> Great numbers of this di&s;per&s;ed armie were inuaded by their enemies, and &s;laine in their pa&s;&s;age homewards, contrarie to the promi&s;e which had beene made vnto them by the Catholiques. The Colonels and Captaines of the Switzers, the chiefe authours of the di&s;&s;olution of that Armie, were &s;euerely puni&s;hed by their <HI>Segneuries,</HI> &s;o that this whole armie was maruellou&s;ly afflicted, and euerie one was &s;cour|ged after one &s;ort or other: and hauing &s;pent and &s;poyled infinitely, did nothing but worke their owne calamitie and ouerthrow.</P>
<P>The King vndoubtedly had taken maruellous care to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uer this mightie puy&s;&s;aunce, and by cunning handling of the matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gui&s;es &s;launder the King.</NOTE> had brought them to this extreame pa&s;&s;e, that vnder the colour of a Pa&s;&s;eport, hee expo&s;ed them to the butcherie, and rage of their enemies. And although that by rea&s;on of
<PB N="120" REF="64"> this politique dealing, he de&s;erued high commendation: yet the <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> &s;o hand|led the matter, that all redownded to his further di&s;credite, and cau&s;ed his &s;ub|iects to &s;peake wor&s;e of him then at anie time before. For the <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> had cau&s;ed it to bee bruited abroad, that not onely the King had willingly &s;uffered the Ger|maines to e&s;cape, contrarie to the coun&s;aile and aduice of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> but al&s;o had giuen them the meanes to retyre in &s;afetie, &s;ome into <HI>Germanie,</HI> and others into <HI>Languedocke,</HI> there to ioyne with the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and &s;o to con|tinue further troubles in the lande, to the great and intollerable harme of the good Catholiques, and the encouraging of Heretikes, and &s;uch as were ene|mies to holy Chuch.</P>
<P>When the Friers and Ie&s;uits in <HI>Paris,</HI> and other principall cities were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the&s;e newes, they brake forth into very &s;editious &s;peeches, openly exclay|ming again&s;t the King, and extolling the wi&s;dome, prowe&s;&s;e &amp; noble acts of the duke of <HI>Gui&s;e:</HI> whereby they procured him much fauor among the multitude that knew nothing, but what they heard by the Leaguers, and their fauorites, which made them think, that the King had killed his thou&s;and, but the <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> his ten thou&s;and. All which treacherous dealings tended to no other end but this: either to make the French beleeue that the K. was not indowed with &s;uch noble and heroycall vertues, as were requi&s;ite for him that &s;hould gouerne &s;o mightie and pui&s;&s;ant a nation, or el&s;e that he was a notorious di&s;&s;embler, a maintainer of Heretikes, &amp; a &s;ecret enemy to the Catholikes. And then what &s;hould they doo with &s;uch a King? let the~ make choi&s;e of another more valiant, more wi&s;e, more prouident, more religious, &amp; a more &s;tout defender of holy Church: and who &s;hould that be, but the <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> who for the zeale, courage, valour, and &s;inguler dexteritie in the mannaging of matters of e&s;tate, was not onely &s;uperior to the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The leaguers attempt a|gainst the yong duches of Bonillon.</NOTE> but the paragon of all Europe.</P>
<P>The leaguers being a&s;&s;ured of the death of the duke of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> and that hee had left his &s;i&s;ter Madame <HI>Charlate de la Marke,</HI> a yong and tender Ladie, heyre to all his &s;oueraigne &s;egneurie, and principalitie of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> thought it their be&s;t to let the king of <HI>Nauarre</HI> alone for a time, at who&s;e handes there was little to bee gotten, vnle&s;&s;e they payed deare for it, and to enterpri&s;e &s;omewhat a|agayn&s;t this de&s;olate Ladie, and either by hooke or by crooke (as wee v&s;e to &s;ay) to get the Dukedome into their po&s;&s;e&s;sion. VVhereupon the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> v&s;ed all the cunning hee coulde, to match his &s;onne the Prince <HI>Ien|uill</HI> with her: and the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> was as earne&s;t a &s;uter for his &s;onne, called <HI>Marthuis de Pont,</HI> and Lorde <HI>Vaudemont.</HI> But neither of them being able by all their deui&s;es, to winne that Ladies fauour, they thought it be&s;t to ioyne together, and to compell her to match according to their lykings. With this re&s;olution they entered the Dukedome of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> with a great power, burning, wa&s;ting, killing, murthering, raui&s;hing, and committing all o|ther horrible and dete&s;table villanies that coulde bee imagined,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The crueltie of the lea|guers again&s;t the dukedom of Bonillon.</NOTE> and be&s;ieged the &s;ayde Ladie, and her two principall Townes, <HI>Sedan</HI> and <HI>Iamets:</HI> where they continued a long tyme, &s;pent much Trea&s;ure, and lo&s;t mo&s;t of theyr men, and in the ende, with &s;hame and di&s;honour, (beeing well beaten at a womans hand, by the valiant conduct of the Lord <HI>Necuile,</HI>) were glad to giue ouer, and returne home.</P>
<PB N="121" REF="64">
<P>While&s;t the dukedom of <HI>Bonillon,</HI> was vexed and tormented with the&s;e trou|ble&s;ome &s;utors, the principal leagers a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Nancie</HI> in <HI>Lorrain,</HI> where there was a great con&s;ultation helde, how they might aduance them&s;elues, and ouer|thow the King, again&s;t who&s;e per&s;on and &s;tate they had for a long time bout all their endeuors.

<P>The King did allowe of &s;uch of the&s;e Articles as did any way concerne the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the reformed Religion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king re|fu&s;eth to grant all the petitions of the league.</NOTE> but con&s;idering that the re&s;t did wonderfull derogate from his Crowne and dignitie, and that they tended directlie to the weakening of him&s;elfe, and the &s;trengthening of the league, of which, for a long tyme, hee had verie hardly conceyued, hee would not bee enduced to condi&s;cend vnto them, by anie manner of meanes or entreatie what&s;oeuer.</P>
<P>Now as the Leaguers laboured openly by the&s;e and &s;uch like deui&s;es, to weaken the King, &s;o they practi&s;ed &s;ecretly to de&s;troy the King of <HI>Nauarre,</HI> and Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> knowing that if they were once ridde of them, it woulde bee an ea&s;ie matter to accompli&s;h the re&s;t.

<P>The King vnder&s;tanding of all the&s;e &s;editious &s;turres, &s;ought by faire meanes and in gentle maner, to reduce them to their obedience, &s;ending out his proclai|mations to pardon what&s;oeuer was pa&s;t, and to burie it in the graue of obli|uion, &s;o that they woulde lay downe their Armes, and liue peaceablie vn|der his authoritie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;editious diuinitie of the Sorbo|ni&s;ts.</NOTE> as in dutie they were bound: but they made no reckoning of the Kinges clemencie, but tearmed it cowardline&s;&s;e, as though hee were afrayed of their forces, beeing animated by the Sorboni&s;ts, and their Doctours in Theologie, who had re&s;olued that they were &s;et free from theyr oath of o|bedience, and former allegiaunce made vnto <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirde.

They refu&s;ed all the Princes of the blood, and cho&s;e the Duke <HI>de Maine,</HI> who was a man much fauoured of the lea|guers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The leaguers appoint a councell of &s;tate.</NOTE> and one that was well acquainted with all their practi&s;es.

The&s;e had no &s;ooner gotten this authoritie into their handes, but they committed mo&s;t horrible outrages again&s;t all &s;uch as they &s;u&s;pected to be the kings friends, impri&s;oning, murthering, robbing, &s;ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing and &s;poyling them in &s;uch &s;ort, as was neuer heard of within any mans remem|brance, and going to the royall pallace called the <HI>Louure,</HI> they &s;eyzed vpon all the kings goods,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The leaguers notorious di&s;obedience.</NOTE> they violated the great Seale of <HI>France,</HI> brake it in peeces, and trode it vnder their feete.

<P>The king had often and very &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;&s;waded them from this &s;editious cour&s;e, and with all lenitie &s;ought to reduce them to their former obedience: but con&s;idering that he preuailed nothing by gentlene&s;&s;e, and clemency, but ra|ther that the people waxed wor&s;e &amp; wor&s;e, he therfore now determined to take a &s;harper cour&s;e, and by force to bring them vnder his obedience, but fearing his owne weakne&s;&s;e, and want of &s;ufficient power to bring his purpo&s;es to pa&s;&s;e for that he was, as it were co~pa&s;&s;ed about with his enemies, not knowing what

<P>The King of <HI>Nauarre</HI> being aduerti&s;ed of the Kings intent, and &s;olicited by &s;undry me&s;&s;engers to come to his ayde with all expedition, called his Nobles and Captaines, and gathered all his forces together, and pa&s;sing ouer the <HI>Loyre</HI> at <HI>Samnur,</HI> went towards the King, who was greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed at <HI>Toures,</HI> and in imminent perill, to bee oppre&s;&s;ed by the Leaguers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The meeting of the King of France, &amp; the King of Nauarre.</NOTE> The King vnder&s;tan|ding of his approach, the thirtie of Aprill &s;ent the Mare&s;chall <HI>Haultmont,</HI> ac|companied with a great number of the Nobilitie, to de&s;ire him to come to <HI>Ple|&s;is de Tours:</HI> where hee with all his Court &s;taid for him.</P>

The kind embracings and louing &s;alutations betweene the&s;e two Potentates, did euidently declare their inward ioy &amp; contentation.

Sundry of the nobilitie, who were popi&s;hly affected, and therefore glad of the Kings bad &s;ucce&s;&s;e, reuolted, and &s;ecretly conueyed them&s;elues away, either to the enemy, or into their owne countries, and by their bad example, drew on in|finite numbers to take the &s;ame cour&s;e, for&s;aking their lawfull prince when hee &s;tood in greate&s;t need of their &s;eruice, expo&s;ing that noble kingdome to the bar|barous villanie of that viperous broode, who neuer cea&s;e gnawing out of the bowels of her, that &s;hould be their deare&s;t and be&s;t beloued mother.</P>
<P>The King wanting &s;ufficient power to &s;top the&s;e wicked proceedings, was forced to &s;uffer the rebels to range at large, and to get many of his townes, both in <HI>Normandy, Britany, Prouince,</HI> and <HI>Dauphiny:</HI> They took likewi&s;e <HI>E&s;pernon:</HI> wher|in they found great &s;tore of wine, corne, &amp; other nece&s;&s;aries for the wars. The&s;e fortunate exploits &s;o encouraged that rebellious route, and &s;o puffed them vp with the pride of their owne forces, that they vtterly refu&s;ed to bow their necks vnder the yoake of obedience: or to admit of any other gouernment then &s;uch as plea&s;ed the~&s;elues. The king was loath to loo&s;e <HI>E&s;pernon,</HI> being a towne of ve|rie good importance, and therfore drew all his forces to the &s;iege therof, where the Mare&s;chall <HI>Biron</HI> was &s;laine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mare&s;chall Biron &s;laine.</NOTE> with a &s;hot from the wall, while hee was verie bu&s;ie in viewing the army, &amp; in giuing order for the planting of the &s;iege Yea, and the king him&s;elf was in great perill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The daunger of the King.</NOTE> hauing his hor&s;e killed vnder him with the &s;ame bullet, wherewith the Mare&s;chall was &s;laine before. Duke <HI>Mercurie</HI> in the meane time tooke <HI>Manus</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> and the duke <HI>de Maine</HI> recouered <HI>Caude|becke,</HI> and cleared all the riuer fro~ <HI>New-hauen</HI> vp to <HI>Roan.</HI> The D. of <HI>Nemours,</HI> go|uernor of <HI>Lions,</HI> took <HI>Vienna</HI> and <HI>Valence,</HI> and by that means co~manded the riuer of <HI>Rhodanus.</HI> Now were the Germains who came into <HI>France</HI> in 91. de&s;irous to returne home: &s;o that taking their leaue of the French K. they marched toward <HI>Germany</HI> as fa&s;t as they could: but by rea&s;on they were not &s;o many, nor &s;o &s;trong
<PB N="145" REF="76"> as when they came fir&s;t into <HI>France,</HI> they were de&s;irous to pa&s;&s;e rather by leaue then by force, and therefore they thought it conuenient to &s;end to the Duke of <HI>Parma</HI> for to obtaine Licen&s;e of him, that they might quietly pa&s;&s;e through the Dukedom of <HI>Luxemburge,</HI> who readily condi&s;ce~ded therto, vpon condition that they &s;hould not rifle the Countrey as they went, but &s;hould trauaile in peace|able manner, and pay for what&s;oeuer they tooke. Thus this great and mightie Army which had in conceite deuoured halfe <HI>France,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ger|maines re|turne home.</NOTE> and at theyr comming had opened their way by fine force, returned home without dooing of anie great matter, and were driuen to aske leaue and to &s;ue to their enimies for their pa&s;port, &s;uch and &s;o &s;trange an alteration en&s;ued in a &s;hort &s;pace.</P>
<P>The Leaguers beeing drunken with this pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e, began to con|&s;ult about the election of a new King, and to that ende the Duke of <HI>Ferta,</HI> and the Cardinall of <HI>Sens,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lea|guers con|&s;ult about a new King.</NOTE> the Popes <HI>Nuntio</HI> were &s;ent to <HI>Paris</HI> to bee pre&s;ent as a&s;&s;i&s;tants in this waightie bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, as well to aide with their adui&s;e and coun&s;ell, as to per&s;wade with &s;undrie great &s;tates, who as yet were not fully re&s;olued in this poynt, neyther whether they &s;houlde a&s;&s;ent to &s;o wicked and de&s;perate proceedings.</P>
