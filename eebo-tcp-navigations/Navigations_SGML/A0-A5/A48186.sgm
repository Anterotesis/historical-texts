<HEAD>A LETTER TO A Member of Parliament CONCERNING <HI>Guards</HI> and <HI>Gari&s;ons.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am not a&s;hamed to own that I was once of opini|on that a Standing Army was nece&s;&s;ary, nor that I owe my Conver&s;ion to the printed Controver&s;y upon that Subject, which was managed very une|qually. On the one &s;ide there appears throughout the whole that irre&s;i&s;tible Spirit of Truth which is in&s;epa|rable from a good Cau&s;e: On the other part there is &s;o much Prevarication, &s;uch mumbling of Thi&s;tles, and
<PB N="4" REF="3">drawing in their Breath every moment, and withal &s;uch weak Arguments, lowne&s;s of Thought, and flatne&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion, that the Reader might be tempted to think they had lo&s;t their Wits with their Integrity. But this Controver&s;y is now at an end, &s;ince the whole Body of the People in two Parliaments have given a Sanction to the ju&s;ter opinion, and (with a true Roman Re&s;olution worthy their Illu&s;trious Predece&s;&s;ors, worthy the noble&s;t, the manlie&s;t, the be&s;t cau&s;e in the World, the cau&s;e of Liberty) have declared, that they have Courage, Ho|ne&s;ty and Wi&s;dom enough to defend them&s;elves, and that they want no Keepers. Nor was this Debate car|ried on with that Heat and Faction which is often found in Popular A&s;&s;emblies; no levelling at the Mini&s;try, nor wreaking their private Di&s;contents under the notion of Publick Service. But it was managed with that Gravity, that Sedatene&s;s, that Candour, and yet with that Noble Con&s;tancy, as might convince the whole World that their Re&s;olutions were the Re&s;ults of the mo&s;t mature Con&s;ideration, and un&s;haken Love to their Country, and Zeal for Liberty. This is declaring in Characters legible to all <HI>Europe,</HI> that it was not private Re&s;entment, popular Faction, or a propen&s;ity to change, but a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our Country's Liberty, that made us throw off our late Allegiance. It &s;hows that we did not expel our King, but that we depo&s;ed a Tyrant. Whereas if we had been &s;o tran&s;ported by our Fortune, &s;o debauched in our Under&s;tandings, and &s;o de&s;titute of all &s;en&s;e of Love and Honour due to our Native Country, as to have allowed that to one King for which we depo&s;ed another, we had been the &s;corn and reproach of Mankind, and ju&s;tly called Traytors, Cowards, and Fools.</P>
<P>However ungrateful this Vote may appear to Flatter|ers
<PB N="5" REF="3">and Courtiers (who are but In&s;ects bred and nouri&s;h|ed out of the Corruption and Stench of bad Govern|ments) yet I doubt not but his Maje&s;ty will con&s;ider it almo&s;t as the unanimous Opinion of that People whot voluntarily offered him two mo&s;t potent Crowns, &s;et him at the head of the Force and Councils of the greate&s;t Confederacy that has been ever united, and &s;upported him through the War at a Charge that neither We nor our Forefathers ever knew, till at la&s;t they enabled him to humble his powerful Adver&s;ary, and bring him to Terms both &s;afe and honourable. Nor did their Affection ter|minate with the War: For though we were in debt near 20000000 <HI>l.</HI> they have increa&s;ed the Civil Li&s;t beyond what it was known in the Reigns of any of his Prede|ce&s;&s;ors, and &s;ettled a great Revenue upon him for Life to &s;upport it. Nay, this very Parliament have given all the Te&s;timony of their Duty which can be con&s;i&s;tent with their Country's Safety; They have cho&s;en a Speaker out of his own Family, and have left him 7000 men for Guards and Gari&s;ons; which, if our Courtiers were hone&s;t, they would not &s;o much as pretend to be nece&s;&s;a|ry. For if we dare take the word of a noble Lord (who has never di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by his aver&s;ion to arbi|trary Power, or hatred to Armies) 3000 men are e|nough to &s;upply the Gari&s;ons, and double as many as were e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d's time for that purpo&s;e. Then what Rea&s;on, or rather what Colour is there for 4000 Guards?</P>
<P>I will not enter upon &s;o invidious a Subject, as that Guards about the King's Per&s;on are both unnece&s;&s;ary and dangerous, tho <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> has made it the di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of Arbitrary Power to have them, and many more Princes have been murder'd than protected by them; nay, even at
<PB N="6" REF="4">this time in our neighbouring Country of <HI>Spain,</HI> tho the King has much more power than we think con&s;i&s;tent with our Con&s;titution, yet he has no Guards: and not many years &s;ince, when their King attempted, to rai&s;e but a &s;in|gle Regiment, it was &s;o re&s;ented, that if they had not been quickly disbanded, the whole Nation had been in Arms, thinking it ignoble and di&s;honourable that their King &s;hould rather tru&s;t his Per&s;on with a few Men of de&s;perate Fortunes, and not of the be&s;t Morals, than with his Nobility, Gentry, and loyal People.</P>
<P>However, &s;ince this Doctrine is not Orthodox, I will take it for granted that Guards are nece&s;&s;ary about the King's Per&s;on: but at the &s;ame time I dare affirm that his three Troops of Hor&s;e, and one Regiment of Foot (which need not exceed 1200 Men) are more than &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e, though his Maje&s;ty was to be better attend|ed than ever I &s;aw him. Then what pretence is there for keeping the remaining 2800? What colour is there for keeping Guards at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> or indeed in the Tower?</P>
<P>Are they kept there to defend the City, or to bridle the Citizens? which, as <HI>Macchiavel</HI> &s;ays, is the only u&s;e of Citadels. If the former, we can tell them, that the City has 20000 Militia to defend them&s;elves, and 200000 Men more that will be ready to take Arms upon occa&s;i|on, and better Men too than an Army will be, when they have been debauch'd and enervated with peace and idlene&s;s; which if they doubt, let them remember the time when a new Army rai&s;ed &s;uddenly out of the City, vanqui&s;hed the King's veteran Troops.</P>
<P>If they keep them to bridle the Citizens, that's our Complaint, and indeed is the only proper and natural u&s;e of Standing Forces in times of Peace. But why mu&s;t the
<PB N="7" REF="4">City of <HI>London</HI> be gari&s;oned more than any other inland-part of the Kingdom? Was ever a Prince better beloved, or a City more loyal? why then mu&s;t they be awed by Citadels?</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be &s;aid, that the Tower is the chief Ma|gazine of the King's Artillery, Arms, and Ammunition, which ought to be well guarded, to prevent a &s;urprize. But why may not the Militia of <HI>London</HI> do duty there by turns? who if they are good for nothing el&s;e, &s;ure may be tru&s;ted to defend the King's Stores. We &s;ee the Bank of <HI>England,</HI> which is the Repo&s;itory of as great Trea&s;ure, is defended by a very few Men. How was the Tower defended before this Incroachment of Armies grew upon us? but then indeed it was a Pri&s;on, and now it is grown into a Gari&s;on.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what end can there be in attempting to &s;ur|prize it? It can't be defended again&s;t a Prince that is be|loved, many days; and whoever does attempt &s;o de&s;pe|rate an Action, is &s;ure to pay for his di&s;obedience with his Life; which is all the &s;ecurity we have that his Maje&s;ty is not a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated every day: for whoever will &s;acrifice him&s;elf, is ma&s;ter of any Man's Life.</P>
<P>I have not laboured this matter &s;o much to mi&s;repre&s;ent the Parliament's Proceedings, or le&s;&s;en their affection to his Maje&s;ty, as to &s;top the mouths of a few Unrea&s;onable Men, who calumniate the Hou&s;e of Commons as undu|tiful to their King, and regardle&s;s of their Countries &s;afe|ty; whereas I think I have made it appear, that they have allowed him near double as many Forces as are ne|ce&s;&s;ary; which makes me the more wonder how &s;ome Unthinking Men are impo&s;ed upon by calling a few Land, Regiments by the name of Mariners, and prevailed with to think them nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>And becau&s;e this Subject has not been handled by tho&s;e Gentlemen who have exhau&s;ted the re&s;t of the Argu|ment, I will take that task upon my &s;elf, and by the next Po&s;t will &s;end you my thoughts upon that affair, and en|deavour to &s;hew that the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Mariners is a u&s;ele&s;s charge to the Nation, a Nu&s;ance to the Navy, and dangerous to the Kingdom's Liberties.</P>
