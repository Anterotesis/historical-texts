<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> A full Account of the Di&s;covery of the Villanous De&s;ign of the <HI>French Papi&s;ts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE 150 <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;ts which were pickt out of the Army, are now at <HI>Carling|ford,</HI> and among them 'tis &s;aid there is one Je&s;uit, all ready to be &s;hipt for <HI>Eng|land:</HI> There is but four of the <HI>French,</HI> and two <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> that were going to <HI>Charle|mount</HI> to &s;uffer, and of them one of the <HI>French</HI> is to be executed; his Crime, and the whole Di&s;covery was thus: He that is to be executed, was formerly a Count in <HI>France,</HI> had Moneys from the <HI>French</HI> King to rai&s;e a Regiment, &s;pent it, and not daring to &s;hew his face, got to <HI>Holland,</HI> and from thence for <HI>England,</HI> where he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the Army, pretending to be a Prote&s;tant, though he never was one, and came with the Army hither, where he writ a Letter to King <HI>James,</HI> that in ca&s;e he would a&s;&s;ure him of a Pardon from the <HI>French</HI> King, he would bring over to him 400 Men; that he &s;hould &s;end his An&s;wer in a Letter, which was to be brought into the <HI>French</HI> Camp, by &s;ome Fellow, who, as a Countryman, was to come with a Cro&s;s of white and red under the cover or folding of his Sleeve, and a Bottle of Brandy, crying, <HI>Brandy-wine, Brandy-wine,</HI> and &s;o up and down only in the <HI>French</HI> Quarter, till one came to him, and &s;aid, <HI>God ble&s;s you Friend, how do you &s;ell your Brandy?</HI> and turn up his Sleeve to look for the Cro&s;s; which when the Huck&s;ter perceived, he was to deliver the Letter from King <HI>James</HI> to him. The Me&s;&s;enger going with this Letter to the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Camp, being taken, di&s;covered the Author, and it's &s;aid, had his Pardon for it. This coming to the General, he forth|with gave orders to make publick Proclamation, at the head of each Regiment, <HI>That if any Papist was in the Army, did deny him&s;elf to be &s;o, and afterward di&s;covered, he &s;hould im|mediately be put to Death, without more ado.</HI> And thereupon mo&s;t, if not all the afore&s;aid 150 were &s;ingled out. Since this Di&s;covery, there is not one <HI>French</HI> man permitted to pa&s;s any Guard, without a Pa&s;s, any where out of the Camp: and orders are given to all Officers, to proclaim, at the head of every Regiment, <HI>That if there be any Roman Catholick, that &s;hal not forthwith declare him&s;elf publickly to be &s;o, if afterward di&s;covered, &s;hall be puni&s;hed with im|mediate Death.</HI> And it's &s;aid, that upon that Proclamation, mo&s;t, if not all tho&s;e at <HI>Carling-ford</HI> are found out to be &s;uch.</P>

<P>WHereas we the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> &s;ince the Landing of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army are threatened, and &s;ome abu&s;es already committed upon them by tho&s;e that call them&s;elves Prote&s;tants, and for their pretence to abu&s;e us and make us odious in the &s;ight of the General and the whole Camp, do a&s;per&s;e and put forth, that we the &s;aid People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> was aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting to the late King <HI>James</HI> in his War, with Money to maintain a Regiment again&s;t the Prote&s;tants; which &s;aid A&s;per&s;ion and envious In|formation, we in the behalf of the re&s;t of our Friends do utterly and &s;olemnly deny, and in the &s;ight of God, can declare we never were aiding nor a&s;&s;i&s;ting the &s;aid King with Money or any thing el&s;e, &s;ave the Quartering men on free Quarter, which no Prote|&s;tant could avoid no more than we; but on the contrary are great &s;ufferers, in&s;omuch that many have not left them to &s;u&s;tain their Families, but &s;tript their Clothes off their Backs, taken their Goods and Victuals out of their Hou&s;es, their Hor&s;es and Cows taken from them, and left in a &s;tate of &s;tarving, and not &s;pared more than any other Prote&s;tant where &s;uffering hath been.</P>

Therefore we make bold to pre&s;ent thee with this our Addre&s;s as unto a Chri|&s;tian Governour, hoping thou wilt be plea&s;ed to take us into thy Care and Favour, that we may not be further expo&s;ed to &s;poil and ruin: As in Duty bound we &s;hall humbly pray the Lord to be thy Reward.</P>
