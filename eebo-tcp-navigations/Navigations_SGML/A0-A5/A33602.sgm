<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Britains,</HI> may not improperly be di&s;tingui&s;hed into two Pe|riods; the former comprehending the interval from <HI>Brute</HI> to <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> whil&s;t the <HI>Britains</HI> are thought to have enjoyed a general Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole I&s;land; the other contain|ing the Memoirs and Tran&s;actions of the <HI>Bri|tains,</HI> under their &s;everal Princes, after their re|ce&s;&s;ion to that part of the I&s;land, &s;ince called <HI>Wales.</HI> The former of the&s;e has been generally accounted of late, ab&s;olutely fal&s;e and unhi&s;tori|cal; and 'tis undoubtedly concluded that all the Pa&s;&s;ages in <HI>Geoffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> (the only remaining Monument of the Affairs of the an|tient <HI>Britains</HI>) which are not con&s;onant to, and agreeable with the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians that &s;peak of <HI>Britain,</HI> are ab&s;olutely fabulous and un&s;incere. The Hi&s;tory of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> has indeed met with better fortune, and the Author <HI>Cara|doc</HI> of <HI>Lhancarvan</HI> is accounted ju&s;t and au|thentick; &s;o that there need no other Apology for the following Work, than that it is for the be&s;t part the genuine Hi&s;tory of that Author. But be|cau&s;e the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Wales</HI> has no &s;mall depen|dance upon, and relation to the Hi&s;tory of the an|tient <HI>Britains</HI> publi&s;hed by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> I think it
<PB REF="5"> nece&s;&s;ary to make &s;ome general reflection, in rela|tion to the Truth and Authority of that Copy.</P>
<P>And here in the fir&s;t place, I mu&s;t take no|tice of two &s;orts of Opinions, mo&s;t widely repug|nant, and as I may &s;ay, diametrically oppo&s;ite to each other; and both in my opinion, equally de|viating from the right apprehen&s;ion of the mat|ter in debate. The one, perfectly rejecting the whole foundation and proce&s;s of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Hi|&s;tory, will not believe &s;o much as one pa&s;&s;age re|lating to the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> but what is deli|vered by <HI>Roman</HI> Writers; as if nothing remark|able could happen in <HI>Britain,</HI> but what mu&s;t needs fall under their &s;pecial Cognizance and Ob|&s;ervation. The other, without any allowance to the Age when the&s;e <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Affairs were tran&s;|acted, (not to mention the utmo&s;t Antiquity of &s;ome part of this Hi&s;tory, cotemporary with which, nothing is certain among the more civilized <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI>) will believe the whole Frame, and all the Circum&s;tances of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, be they never &s;o ridiculous and extravagant. But not to in&s;i&s;t on &s;o bigotted an Opinion, as to think that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory is univer&s;ally true, and altogether authentick; I will confine my &s;elf to the examination of the other Extream, to &s;ee whe|ther that Hi&s;tory publi&s;hed by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> be &s;o ab&s;olutely fabulous as is frequently repre&s;ented, and generally believed. Now they who di&s;credit this Hi&s;tory, either wholly attribute the Frame and Invention of it to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> or el&s;e granting him to be a faithful Tran&s;lator, a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that the Copy he received was fictitious, and perfectly owing to the unwarrantable Forgeries of the fa|bulous Monks. So that the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent enquiries, will naturally fall under tho&s;e two
<PB REF="5"> Di&s;qui&s;itions; <HI>1.</HI> Whether <HI>Geoffrey</HI> be the real Contriver and Compo&s;er of this Hi&s;tory? And <HI>2ly,</HI> Suppo&s;ing him to be innocent of this Su&s;pi|cion, whether the Hi&s;tory publi&s;hed by him, be perfectly fabulous, and in all re&s;pects a Monki&s;h Legend?</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> As to what relates to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> though me|thinks there need no greater Argument to evi|dence his Innocency from &s;o &s;u&s;pected an Impo|&s;ture, as his being the Contriver of this Hi&s;tory, than that be profe&s;&s;edly owns the receipt of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu&s;cript from <HI>Walter,</HI> Arch Deacon of <HI>Oxford;</HI> yet becau&s;e the Prejudice of &s;ome Men oftentimes ob&s;cures their Under&s;tanding, in things otherwi&s;e very clear and open, it will be requi&s;ite to dwell &s;omewhat more particularly up|on that Subject: or if the World be once per|&s;waded, that the whole Invention is owing to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and that there was no &s;uch Account of the <HI>Britains</HI> in being, before he publi&s;hed his, Hi&s;tory; the whole &s;eries of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Affairs not mentioned in the Writings of the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors, and all that long continued Succe&s;&s;ion of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings for &s;o many Ages, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be ac|counted fabulous, and a perfect Legend. But be|fore that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> &s;hould be &s;o unrea&s;onably at|tainted of &s;uch notorious Forgery, and his Hi&s;to|ry be &s;o generally condemned; one might expect that &s;uch evident Proofs could be produced to evince &s;o ab&s;olute a Po&s;ition, as to render it pa&s;t all Di&s;pute and Contradiction. For to charge any one with In&s;incerity, for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e it is the common Vogue and Sentiment of the World, is in my opinion a greater Argument of Partiality and Prejudice, than of &s;olid and ju|dicious Rea&s;oning.</P>
<PB REF="6">
<P>Now the greate&s;t rea&s;on that I can think of, why the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory is attributed to the in|vention of <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> is, that almo&s;t upon its fir&s;t appearance in the World, <HI>William</HI> of <HI>New|borough</HI> and <HI>Geraldus Cambren&s;is</HI> exclaim a|gain&s;t it, and &s;eem to lay the whole Impo&s;ture to the charge of <HI>Geoffrey.</HI> The words of <HI>Newbo|rough</HI> are the&s;e; <HI>At contra quidem</HI> (&s;peaking before of <HI>Gildas) no&s;tris temporibus pro ex|piandis his Britonum maculis &s;criptor emer&s;it, ridicula de ii&s;dem figmenta contexens, eo&s;que long&egrave; &s;upra virtutem Macedonum &amp; Roma|norum impudenti vanitate attollens. Gau|fridus hic dictus e&s;t, Agnomen habens Arturi, pro eo quod fabulas de Arturo ex pri&s;cis Bri|tonum figmentis &s;umptas, &amp; ex proprio au|ctas per &s;uperductum Latini &s;ermonis Colo|rem, hone&s;to hi&s;tori&aelig; nomine palliavit. Qui etiam majori au&s;u, cuju&s;dam Merlini divina|tiones fallaci&s;&s;imas, quibus utique de proprio plurimum adjecit, dum eas in Latinum tran&s;|funderet, tanquam Authenicas, &amp; immobili veritate &s;ubnixas prophetias vulgavit.</HI></P>
<P>From this Pa&s;&s;age it is apprehended, that <HI>New|borough</HI> thought that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory was &s;olely owing to the Contrivance and Invention of <HI>Geoffrey;</HI> whereas nothing is more evident, than that the only thing he lays to <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s charge, is, that he augmented, and of his own head made Additions to the Copy he received. And &s;eeing that <HI>Newborough</HI> expre&s;ly mentions <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s tran&s;lating into Latin, &s;ome antient Figments of the <HI>Britains</HI> concerning King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and unwarrantably adding to the &s;ame; it is ma|nife&s;tly apparent, that be never took <HI>Geoffrey</HI> to be the Contriver of the whole of what he pub|li&s;hed,
<PB REF="6"> otherwi&s;e it is hardly conceivable, that &s;uch an inveterate Enemy of that Hi&s;tory, would conceal any thing that might derogate from the Truth and Authority of it. Be&s;ides, <HI>Newborough</HI> throughout his whole Preface, wherein be endea|vours to invallidate, and render the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi|&s;tory fabulous, chiefly in&s;i&s;ts upon the Life of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and the Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn;</HI> not a word of <HI>Brutus</HI> and his <HI>Trojans,</HI> which, th&ocirc; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ince accounted as notorious a piece of Romance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">s any at all; it &s;eems he had Faith to &s;wallow. Indeed, the Pa&s;&s;ages in King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Life, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">he Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn</HI> tending much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, were too great and extravagant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">o be credited by him, (who by his Character of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, &s;eems to have bore but very &s;lender Affe|ction towards the <HI>Welch</HI>) by rea&s;on that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">erogated much from the Fame and Valour of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Saxons;</HI> &s;o that I am afraid, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">dium which <HI>Newborough</HI> bore to <HI>Geoffrey</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nd his Hi&s;tory, depended more upon National Honour and Reputation, than the Truth and Sin|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">erity of Hi&s;tory. For &s;urely he could never be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> warmly exa&s;perated again&s;t a fabulous Hi&s;tory, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ad he but the Candor to con&s;ult his own, unle&s;s here had been &s;ome other motive to rai&s;e and fo|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ent his Pa&s;&s;ion.

<PB REF="7" MS="y"> manife&s;t, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had their Arch|bi&s;hops long before the arrival of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> the Monk, whom <HI>Newborough</HI> pretends to have been the fir&s;t who underwent that Dignity in this I&s;land. But as his Arguments again&s;t <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Hi&s;tory are weak and invalid, and his whole Preface more an Invective than a Confutation, &s;o his Credit &s;hould be rejected and undervalued, for charging another Hi&s;tory with fal&s;hood, when his own &s;eems wholly interwoven with ridiculous Legends and Monki&s;h Fictions.</P>
<P>But be the occa&s;ion of <HI>Newborough</HI>'s di&s;like of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory what it will, 'tis evident, that nothing can be concluded from the above quoted Pa&s;&s;age, more than that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> made Additions to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Copy be received of the Archdeacon of <HI>Oxford.</HI> And this is no more than what may ea|&s;ily and &s;afely be granted; for the Life of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> and the Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn,</HI> the main Subjects of <HI>Newborough</HI>'s Di&s;content, may proba|bly be in&s;erted into the Hi&s;tory by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> at lea&s;t they were augmented, and &s;everal Traditions were added by him. <HI>Bale,</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that he writ the Life of King <HI>Arthur</HI> in a di&s;tinct Treati&s;e and him&s;elf owns in the Preface to his fourth Book, which comprehends the Prophecies of <HI>Merlyn,</HI> that upon the Reque&s;t of <HI>Alexander</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> he had tran&s;lated <HI>Merlyn</HI>'s Prophecies out of <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> into <HI>Latin,</HI> before the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Copy came to his Hands. Now, when <HI>Geoffrey</HI> had received the Manu&s;cript from the Archdeacon, and was engaged in tran&s;lating it into <HI>Latin,</HI> 'tis no &s;trange matter to imagine, that as occa&s;ion required, he might am|plify, and add to it, out of his former Tracts. F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> it is obvious to &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;everal things con|cerning <HI>Arthur</HI> and <HI>Merlyn,</HI> might be pre&s;erue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB REF="7"> in the I&s;land of great <HI>Britain,</HI> which were long ago ob&s;olete among the <HI>Britains</HI> of <HI>Armorica,</HI> from whence the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Copy is &s;aid to have been brought over.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>Newborough</HI> had attributed the whole Frame of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory to <HI>Geof|frey,</HI> which is evident he does not, his Authority cannot ballance with far more authentic Hi&s;torians, &s;uch as <HI>H. Huntington, R. Hovedon, Matthew</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> and others, but more particularly <HI>Matthew Paris,</HI> who in expre&s;s Terms, calls <HI>Geoffrey,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ad Ann. <HI>1151.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The Faithful Tran&s;lator of the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Hi&s;tory.</HI> And &s;eeing then, that it was in tho&s;e times ap|prehended to be an antient Manu&s;cript, and none of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Contrivance, when the Cheat might he be&s;t di&s;covered, and there wanted not good Incli|nations to detect &s;o notorious a Forgery; how in the&s;e latter times, it could be &s;o luckily found out, that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> was the &s;ole Inventor and Compo&s;er of the Hi&s;tory, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly divine.</P>
<P>The other Rea&s;on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Camb. <HI>De&s;cript. Cap.</HI> 7.</NOTE> why <HI>Geoffrey</HI> is thought to be the Author of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, is grounded upon a Pa&s;&s;age in <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is,</HI> who &s;peaking of the Etymology of <HI>Wales,</HI> rejects the Denomination of it from either Duke <HI>Wallo,</HI> or Queen <HI>Wendolen, &s;icut fabulo&s;a Galfredi Arturi mentitur Hi&s;toria.</HI> Now this is thought an invicible Argument again&s;t <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and a palpable detection of his in&s;incerity, &s;ince <HI>Giraldus,</HI> his own Country-man &s;trikes at him, and accu&s;es him of Forgery; whereas upon nicer examination, we may ea&s;ily di&s;cover how that <HI>Gi|raldus</HI> quarrels only with the Hi&s;tory which <HI>Geof|frey</HI> publi&s;hed, and which upon that account bore his Name. For had <HI>Giraldus</HI> though it to be only a Contrivance of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s, had he &s;u&s;pected that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> fal&s;ly pretended to have received an
<PB REF="8"> antient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu&s;cript, and by that means to have impo&s;ed upon the World; Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that upon &s;o plain Conviction of fal&s;hood, he would believe and give Credit to an Hi&s;tory, which he was &s;atisfied was altogether a Fable? But on the con|trary, we find him a&s;&s;enting to the Story of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and the divi&s;ion of the I&s;land betwixt his three Sons; and in &s;hort, excepting in this one place, he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to be an ab&s;olute Votary of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, whence 'tis evident, he apprehended <HI>Geoffrey</HI> to be no more than a faithful Tran&s;lator of an antient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Copy.</P>
<P>I need not take notice of <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Malmsbury,</HI> becau&s;e that by the be&s;t account, he is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been dead before <HI>Geoffrey</HI> publi&s;hed his Hi|&s;tory, and con&s;equently he could never &s;ee it; &s;o that this Expre&s;&s;ion in him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> I.</NOTE> <HI>Hic e&s;t Arthurus de quo Britonum Nuge hodicque delirant,</HI> mu&s;t likely refer to the then pre&s;ent Traditions and Accounts of the <HI>Welch</HI> concerning King <HI>Arthur,</HI> which proba|bly might be too great and extravagant. For 'tis certain that a traditional Account of any Per&s;on or Action, the farther it recedes from the Spring and Original, the more corrupt and imperfect it &s;till pro|ceeds; and like a Ball of Snow, it gathers and aug|ments in its journey; &s;o that it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that the vulgar Account which the <HI>Welch</HI> in <HI>Malmsbury</HI>'s time delivered of King <HI>Arthur,</HI> was too far incredible and &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>But &s;ince the Rea&s;ons produced for proving <HI>Geof|frey</HI> to be the Author of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, &s;eem not to be &s;atisfactory and evincing; let us &s;ee whether the contrary a&s;&s;ertion can be more rea&s;on|ably maintained. And fir&s;t, 'tis manife&s;t that <HI>Geof|frey</HI> could not be the total Inventor of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, by rea&s;on that &s;everal things, and &s;ome of
<PB REF="8"> the mo&s;t material Pa&s;&s;ages therein contained, are agreeable with the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Gildas</HI> and <HI>Nen|nius,</HI> the Poetical Fragments of <HI>Talie&s;&s;yn,</HI> not to mention the <HI>Saxon</HI> Manu&s;cript,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notes up|on <HI>Bede.</HI></NOTE> quoted by Mr. <HI>Whee|lock,</HI> and other Authors far more antient than <HI>Geof|frey.</HI> 'Tis owned indeed <HI>Geoffrey</HI> might borrow the ground and Plat-form of his Romance from <HI>Merlyn</HI> or <HI>Talie&s;&s;yn,</HI> or rather from <HI>Nennius,</HI> in who&s;e Writings there is &s;ome &s;light Account of the <HI>Britains</HI> being de&s;cended from the <HI>Trojans;</HI> but the &s;uper&s;tructure is all his own, who living in an ignorant Age, and well knowing he could not well be di&s;proved, took the Liberty to make what Inven|tion he plea&s;ed, and then recommended it to the World, for a true, undoubted Hi&s;tory. But not|with&s;tanding all this conce&s;&s;ion, I think there is as little rea&s;on to attribute the Frame and Compo|&s;ition of this Hi&s;tory to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> as there can be, to think him Contriver of the Ground and Plot of it. For it &s;eems to me very unaccountable, that if <HI>Geoffrey</HI> was to invent and compo&s;e this Hi&s;tory, why in this account of the Tran&s;actions betwixt the <HI>Britains</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> he &s;hould &s;o widely di&s;agree with, and deviate from the Writings of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians. For certainly, nothing could add more Authority to a Fable, than exactly to fol|low the &s;teps of creditable Authors, in tho&s;e things they both had occa&s;ion to treat of. This in all pro|bability, would not only render that part of the Hi|&s;tory un&s;u&s;picious, but likewi&s;e Credit and Autho|rize the re&s;t, of which there was no account in <HI>Ro|man</HI> Authors. And this di&s;agreement betwixt the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, and the Writings of the Roman Hi&s;torians, tho' frequently produced to overthrow the Authority of it, induces me to believe, not only that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> was not the Author, but likewi&s;e that the
<PB REF="9"> Manu&s;cript was antient, and much elder than the time, in which it was fir&s;t made publick.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides, <HI>Geoffrey</HI> dedicates his Tran&s;lation to <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> Son to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, which in all likelihood he would never have ventured to do, had the Original been of his own Contrivance, for fear lea&s;t that the Cheat being di&s;|covered, he &s;hould be found, to put upon a Per&s;on of Eminent Quality, with whom the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory was then in great E&s;teem. For to him it is that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> owns the Receipt of this Manu&s;cript from the Archdeacon of <HI>Oxford,</HI> which he affirms to be very antient, and by his Reque&s;t was per&s;uaded to tran&s;late it into the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue. It was a very ea&s;ie matter for the Earl of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> to find out <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Integrity, by enquiring of the Archdeacon (who by all Accounts is reckoned his co-temporary) whether he had delivered &s;uch an antient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Copy into <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s hands, and whether the Tran|&s;lation ju&s;tly an&s;wered the Original. The&s;e Enquiries were natural, upon the publication of any new Hi|&s;tory, which made &s;uch con&s;iderable noi&s;e and cla|mour in the World, and which gave &s;uch an Ac|count of the antient <HI>Britains,</HI> as was never before thought or heard of among the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation. And &s;uppo&s;ing the Earl of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> to have omitted the&s;e Enquiries, yet it is &s;carce conceivable, but that in ca&s;e of &s;o open a Forgery, the Archdeacon would di&s;cover the Cheat, unle&s;s it can be thought that he was privy to, and had a hand in the Contrivance. But he was &s;o far from detecting <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Impo|&s;ture, that he him&s;elf owns too, to have tran&s;lated the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory fir&s;t into <HI>Latin,</HI> and then in his latter days, to <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> again from the <HI>Latin,</HI> as may he &s;till &s;een in the <HI>Archives</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us</HI>-College Li|brary. Now if there be any heed to, or dependance upon
<PB REF="9"> this, if it be true, that the Archdeacon did tran|&s;late, and con&s;equently allow of this Hi&s;tory, it ap|pears very evident to me, that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> can be in no wi&s;e the Author or Contriver of it.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> took a fancy to <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Tran&s;lation, more upon the account that his Father had lately &s;ubdued the <HI>Welch,</HI> and therefore &s;eemed to add to his Father's Glory, than that he did credit and believe the Hi&s;tory, does not &s;eem to be &s;o true and evincing. For wherein could the publication of this Hi&s;tory contribute to the advance|ment of his Father's Name? Was it becau&s;e he had Conquered a People, who&s;e Ance&s;tors appeared by this Hi&s;tory, to be formerly Valiant and War|like? This was performed by others before him, and I can conceive no great addition to any Man's Fame, to Conquer a handful of People with a numerous Army, tho' their Fore-fathers had been Stout and Victorious. This is &s;urely too &s;light a Pretence for the reception of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory by the Earl of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> and too weak an Argument to de&s;troy the Truth and Authority of it. 'Tis certain, that it took exceeding well in the World at that time, nor was it oppo&s;ed till after <HI>Robert</HI>'s Death, when <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Newborough</HI> more out of Malice and Di&s;content, than any Love he bore to Truth, began to charge both the Original and Tran&s;lator with in&s;incerity. I cannot &s;ee, upon the whole, the lea&s;t Rea&s;on, why the Contrivance and Invention of this Hi&s;tory &s;hould he attributed to <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> or that the Authority of it depends any way upon him, more than the Fide|lity of his Tran&s;lation. I &s;hall therefore conclude this Subject with the Character be&s;towed upon <HI>Geof|frey,</HI> and the Hi&s;tory by him publi&s;hed by <HI>Ponticus Virunnius,</HI> who flouri&s;hed in the Year <HI>1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">90.</HI> a Man of great Reading, and excellent Learning of his time, who did not think it lo&s;t Labour to draw an Epitome of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory: <HI>Giraldus</HI> (&s;ays

<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> But &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>Geoffrey</HI> to be innocent from this &s;u&s;pected Impo&s;ture, and that he did no more than faithfully tran&s;late a <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu&s;cript he received of the Archdeacon; it may be farther ob|jected, that &s;eeing it abounds with &s;o many unwar|rantable matters of fact, and &s;o extravagant Fables and Prodigies, it appears extreamly &s;u&s;picious, and &s;en&s;ibly &s;mells of a Monki&s;h production. For how is it po&s;&s;ible, you will &s;ay, that any Account, ex|cepting what is found in the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tories, could be had of the <HI>Britains,</HI> and that not only before, but even after their &s;ubjection to the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> &s;ince there is much rea&s;on to doubt, whe|ther the <HI>Britains,</HI> as well as other unlattered Na|tions, had any means to convey any Knowledge to Po&s;terity, for want of the Art of Writing? For if the Affairs and Tran&s;actions of the <HI>Britains</HI> were only handed down by Tradition, and they had no other way or method to pre&s;erve their Memories, then certainly all Pretences to antient Records, and con|&s;equently to this <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu&s;cript, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been tran&s;lated by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be vain and groundle&s;s.</P>
<P>And thus it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Britains</HI> had no Writing among them, neither before nor after the <HI>Roman</HI> Conque&s;t; whence it follows, that there is no true nor certain account of any matter tran&s;lated among them, but what is recorded in <HI>Roman</HI> Hi|&s;tories. But tho' this be frequently in&s;inuated, yet I
<PB REF="10"> think, the contrary can with greater ea&s;e and per|&s;picuity, be made to appear. As to the <HI>Britains</HI> having no Writing among them, during their &s;ub|jection to the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, the contrary is &s;o evident and notorious, that I conceive it lo&s;t time to go about to di&s;prove it. 'Tis &s;ufficient to lay down the Words of <HI>Tacitus,</HI> an Author of un|&s;haken Reputation;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vita A|gric.</NOTE> <HI>Jam ver&ograve; Principum filios liberalibus Artibus erudire, &amp; ingenia Britanno|rum &s;tudiis Gallorum ante<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">erre, &amp; qui mod&ograve; linguam Romanorum abnuebant, eloquentiam concupi&s;cerent.

And can we imagine, that among &s;o many Able and Learned Per&s;ons, as the <HI>Britains</HI> mu&s;t in rea&s;on be, when educated in the <HI>Roman</HI> way, and owned to be very tractable in their Edu|cation, not one &s;hould prove &s;o affectionate to his Country, as to note down the State and Tran&s;action<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it? Certainly, if they learne all the Civilities and Sciences of the <HI>Romans,</HI> Hi&s;tory was not &s;o &s;light and trivial a &s;ubject of their Indu&s;try, as to be undervalued; and I know not where they could better employ their Skill, than in Writing the Hi|&s;tory of their Native Country. It was natural for them being once civilized, to enquire into the Origine and Antiquity of their Nation, the State and Con|dition of their Country before the <HI>Roman</HI> Conque&s;t, and having made the be&s;t &s;earch they could, whether by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ral or written Tradition into the&s;e Enquiries, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ould in all rea&s;on, according to the Cu&s;tom and
<PB REF="11"> manner of the <HI>Romans,</HI> commit all to Writing.</P>
<P>But allowing the <HI>Britains</HI> to haue learnt the Art of Writing from the <HI>Romans,</HI> after their &s;ubjection to the Empire, yet 'tis certain they had no &s;uch thing among them, before the di&s;covery of this I&s;land by <HI>Julius C&aelig;&s;ar,</HI> and con&s;equently, that all the former Part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory which precides that E|poch, mu&s;t be fal&s;e and fictitious.

But as to this pa&s;|&s;age in <HI>Gildas,</HI> if in his time, there were no re|mains of his Ance&s;tors left in writing; I would fain learn upon what Ground and Authority, he could &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;ert that the <HI>Britains</HI> from their fir&s;t Plantation in this I&s;land, were proud and irre|ligious,
<PB REF="12"> and their Kings cruel and tyrannical.

<P>But allowing that <HI>Gildas,</HI> in compo&s;ing that &s;mall Fragment of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, received no Light from any <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Record, but was con&s;trained to borrow out of the Writings of Foreigners; it con|cludes no farther, than that he had not the good Fortune to meet with <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu&s;cripts, not that there were none really remaining in <HI>Britain.</HI> And farther, &s;uppo&s;ing that in <HI>Gildas</HI> his time, there were no remains of the antient <HI>Britains</HI> left in this I&s;land, but were all utterly lo&s;t; yet according to <HI>Gildas</HI> his own acknowledgment, and upon the <HI>Saxons</HI> prevailing in the Country, they might be carried over by the exuled <HI>Britains</HI> to <HI>Armories,</HI> from whence the Archdeacon of <HI>Oxford</HI> is &s;aid to have brought over the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Copy be delivered to <HI>Geoffrey.</HI> But if there was no written Account of the former State of <HI>Britain,</HI> in the Age of <HI>Gil|das,</HI> how comes it to pa&s;s, that any &s;uch thing &s;hould be di&s;covered and brought to light in &s;ucceed|ing Ages. And not to in&s;i&s;t upon the Authority of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manu&s;cript tran&s;lated by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> we have good rea&s;on to pre&s;ume, that the antient <HI>Britains</HI>

<P>As to the former, <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">de,</HI> who&s;e Authority I pre|&s;ume, will not be que&s;tioned, expre&s;ly affirmed it.

<P>And that the <HI>Saxons,</HI> long after their Conver|&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, retired to <HI>Ireland</HI> for this pur|po&s;e, we have the Te&s;timony of their antient and mo&s;t authentick Hi&s;torian; &s;o that, I think,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bed.

But 'tis again to be doubted, whether both the <HI>Saxons</HI> and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> did not primarily derive their Characters from the <HI>Britains:</HI> For though the Briti&s;h Language <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">he now writ in a different Character from the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>Saxon,</HI> yet upon antient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Mo|numents and In&s;criptions, mo&s;t of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Let|ters, different from the pre&s;ent <HI>Roman</HI> Alphabet, are plainly to be &s;een.

<P>As to the civil part of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, that the Tran&s;actions of State were recorded, and that Copies thereof came to the hands of Po&s;terity, we have the expre&s;s Te&s;timony of <HI>Nennius,</HI> who flou|ri&s;hed about Three Hundred Years after <HI>Gildas</HI> For in his Preface to his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Britains,</HI> he openly declares, that he compos'd his Hi&s;tory, <HI>Partim majorum Traditionibus, partim Scri|ptis, partim etiam Monumentis veterum Bri|tanniae Incolarum.</HI> Here <HI>Nennius</HI> &s;ays, that he partly extracted his Hi&s;tory out of the Writings of the Antient <HI>Britains.</HI> And what could the&s;e Writings be?

<P>But be&s;ides, That the <HI>Britains</HI> kept Memorials of their Tran&s;actions, we may rationally gather from the Con&s;titution and Profe&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Bards.

<P>But that the <HI>Bards</HI> did not only commit to memory the famous Deeds of their Princes and Heroes, and &s;o recite and repeat them upon oc|ca&s;ions; but al&s;o that they wrote down and re|corded what they repeated, we have the ample Te&s;timony of <HI>Giraldus Cambren&s;is.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambr.

<PB REF="15"> and mo&s;t famous Tran&s;actions of their Kings; I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Geoffrey</HI> may not, as to a great part of it, pretend to greater Authority than is generally attributed to it. And if it be objected, that the <HI>Bards,</HI> by a Poetical Liberty out did the Truth of Hi&s;tory, in the Prai&s;es of tho&s;e Princes they were to celebrate; yet thus far it may rea&s;onably be acknowledged, that the Names and Succe&s;&s;ion of the &s;everal Kings are real, and con&s;equently that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> could never be the Inventer of &s;o large a Li&s;t of Nick-Names, as he is generally thought to be. For it is very pro|bable, that the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Britains</HI> tran&s;la|ted by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> was compo&s;ed partly out of the&s;e Genealogies peculiar to the <HI>Bards,</HI> and partly out of any other Records and Monuments of the <HI>Britains;</HI> both which I have &s;hewn to have been pre&s;erved, and u&s;ed among them antiently.</P>
<P>But to de&s;cend to the particulars of this Hi&s;to|ry, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;u&s;picious Relation, is that of the landing of <HI>Brute</HI> with a Colony of <HI>Tro|jans,</HI> the &s;everal Cro&s;&s;es and Encounters he &s;u&s;tain|ed in his Voyage; and then of this I&s;land receiv|ing its Name from him. Should we indeed re|flect upon the particular Circum&s;tances of this Sto|ry, we might upon good rea&s;on be &s;atisfied of the Vanity and fal&s;ene&s;s of them; but therefore to conclude, that becau&s;e the Building is &s;u&s;picious, the Foundation con&s;equently mu&s;t be fabulous, and a perfect Contrivance; does, I think, de&s;erve &s;ome better Examination: For if we do but reflect upon the contemporary Hi&s;tories of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> tho&s;e more polite and literate Nations, we may with equal pretence of Rea&s;on affirm, that there is no foundation for any matter of Fact be|fore the Olympiads; or that the relation of <HI>Aeneas</HI>'s coming to <HI>Italy,</HI> and all that Hi&s;tory, to the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> are altogether groundle&s;s and
<PB REF="15"> impertinent, becau&s;e they are intermixt with Fa|bles and impo&s;&s;ibilities. <HI>Livy</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that all the Tran&s;actions before the Building of <HI>Rome,</HI> are rather owing to Poetical Fancy and Extra|vagancies, than to any true and certain Matter of Fact; and therefore be declin'd to give either his A&s;&s;ent or Di&s;&s;ent, to any thing related of tho&s;e Times:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Praefat.</NOTE> <HI>Qu&aelig; ante conditam condendamve Ur|bem, poeticis magis decora fabulis, quam in|corruptis rerum ge&s;tarum monumentis tradun|tur, ea nec affirmare, nec refellere in animo e&s;t.</HI> And <HI>Plutarch</HI> goes farther, and tells us, that the Original and Etymology of <HI>Rome,</HI> that famous City, &s;o well known afterwards over all the World, could not be agreed upon among the di|ver&s;ity of Authors, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be very ob|&s;cure and uncertain.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vita Rom.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign">.</P>
<P>But for all their own Hi&s;torians do allow that the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e Times are fabulous and un|certain; yet there are none that que&s;tion the being of <HI>Aeneas,</HI> and that the <HI>Romans</HI> were de&s;cen|ded from him. The like may be urged for the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and the landing of the <HI>Trojans</HI> in this I&s;land; that though many particular Cir|cum&s;tances are fabulous, and entirely poetical, yet it does not thence nece&s;&s;arily follow, that there is no manner of ground or foundation for &s;uch a Relation. Neither is it &s;ufficient Conviction, to urge, that the very being of <HI>Brute</HI> is all a Fi|ction, by rea&s;on that the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians make no mention of &s;uch a Per&s;on to be the Son of <HI>Sil|vius;</HI> becau&s;e, that through the whole Succe&s;&s;ion from <HI>Aeneas</HI> to <HI>Romulus,</HI> the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times take notice only of the Son that was to &s;uc|ceed; it being unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that all the Kings of <HI>Latium</HI> during that period, &s;hould be|get
<PB REF="16"> each of them, but one Son. And there|fore, what by the ob&s;curity of tho&s;e Ages, and what by bearing regard only to the Line of Suc|ce&s;&s;ion, many collateral Princes e&s;caped the Cog|nizance of future Hi&s;torians. Nor is it enough to affirm, that the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Brute</HI> is but lately known and di&s;covered to the World, whereas the fabulous <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory has been recorded from Antiquity; becau&s;e, that though we are not cer|tain that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory has been handed down to Po&s;terity in Writing; yet we are &s;ure, that it was an antient Tradition, long before <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s publi&s;hing of it; and one &s;hould think, that an antient National Tradition, might require a &s;tricter Examination, than ha&s;tily to throw it a&s;ide, as fabulous and of no Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>But the Que&s;tion is not, Whether the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, as related by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> be, as to all the Circum&s;tances of it, true and real Matter of Fact; for that, no Man, I pre&s;ume, can rea&s;ona|bly maintain; but whether there be any ground or foundation of Truth couched under the&s;e Poe|tical and fabulous Narratives. Now the fir&s;t thing we meet with in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, is, an Account of <HI>Brutus</HI> his Pedigree, how he was de&s;cended from the <HI>Trojans,</HI> and having acciden|tally &s;lain his Father <HI>Silvius,</HI> how he was forced to flee into <HI>Greece,</HI> whence, after &s;everal Scuf|fles with <HI>Pendra&s;us,</HI> a petty Prince of that Coun|try, he thought fit to retire, and to &s;eek his For|tune by Sea. But he had not wandered long, when he met with <HI>Corinaeus,</HI> with another Par|ty of de&s;olate <HI>Trojans,</HI> with whom having joyn|ed his Forces, he followed the Coun&s;el of the Oracle, and at la&s;t arrives in this I&s;land, from him afterwards called <HI>Britain.</HI> Now as to the particular Circum&s;tances related in the Life of <HI>Brutus,</HI> they may properly be placed in the &s;ame
<PB REF="16"> Cla&s;s with <HI>Homer</HI>'s account of the Travels of <HI>Uly&s;&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Virgil</HI>'s De&s;cription of <HI>Aeneas</HI> his Ad|venture to <HI>Italy;</HI> that is to &s;ay, that they are Poe|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ical Fictions, and perfectly con&s;onant to the humour <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">f that fabulous Age. But the Que&s;tion in hand will be, whether there be any probability for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">round of this Story, that <HI>Brute</HI> &s;hould bring over a Colony of <HI>Trojans,</HI> and &s;eat him&s;elf in this I&s;land. Now what is mo&s;t materially urged again&s;t it, is the Novelty of this Di&s;cour&s;e, that none of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;torians make the lea&s;t mention of &s;uch a Per&s;on as <HI>Brutus;</HI> and that <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> who &s;eem to have enquired more narrowly into the Original of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Britains,</HI> found no &s;uch Tradition in their time; otherwi&s;e in giving their opinion whence the <HI>Bri|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ains</HI> were derived, they would never have omit|<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ed &s;uch an antient National Tradition, of their being de&s;cended from the <HI>Trojans.</HI> Be&s;ides, that <HI>Gildas,</HI> who was a <HI>Britain,</HI> takes no notice of &s;uch a Tradition, which in all probability be would ne|ver have omitted, had there been &s;uch an account of their Origine in his time.</P>
<P>As to what is objected again&s;t the Antiquity of this Tradition, is certainly very erroneous; for 'tis &s;o far from being fir&s;t known to the World, at the publication of <HI>Geoffrey</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, that <HI>Nennius,</HI> long before that time, and <HI>Merlyn,</HI> much antienter then he, &s;peak of the <HI>Britains</HI> being de&s;cended from <HI>Troy.</HI> Nay the <HI>Saxons</HI> them&s;elves before <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> were not unacquainted with this Tradition, as plain|ly appears, from the antient <HI>Saxon</HI> Poet, mention'd by Mr. <HI>Wheelock,</HI> whom he thus tran&s;lates;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Notes on <HI>Bede.</HI></NOTE>

<P>That <HI>Gildas</HI> &s;hould make no mention of this <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Tradition, is no great wonder, and as little to the purpo&s;e, to invallidate the Antiquity of it; for we mu&s;t not regard the Intent and Purport of <HI>Gil|das</HI>'s Writing, which was not to give an account of the Hi&s;tory and Antiquity of the <HI>Britains,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> much as to inveigh again&s;t the Prophanene&s;s and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Age; wherein his Zeal and Pa&s;&s;ion carried him &s;o far, that he did not &s;pare ei|ther Princes or the greate&s;t Per&s;ons; and therefore he might well omit to give an account of the Ori|gine of the <HI>Britains,</HI> &s;eeing it was remote from, and exclu&s;ive of his purpo&s;e. <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> indeed &s;eems to have been &s;omewhat more inqui&s;itive about the antient State and De&s;cent of tho&s;e People he invaded; b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters"> his &s;tay in <HI>Britain</HI> was &s;o &s;hort, and his knowledg of the Country &s;o defective, being he had no Com|munication with the Ireland <HI>Britains,</HI> whom he own him&s;elf to be the antient Inhabitants, that it can b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> no great wonder he &s;hould be ignorant of this Tra|dition: for if this curious Per&s;on had had the oppor|tunity of a free Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Britains,</HI> he would in all likelyhood have left a large Di&s;covery of their Manners and Cu&s;toms, and given a more perfect De&s;cription of <HI>Britain;</HI> which at that time would have been a very acceptable Performance, to all the Per&s;ons of Learning and Curio&s;ity in <HI>Rome,</HI> who as yet had but very &s;hallow knowledg of the I&s;land.

<P>But admitting the <HI>Grecians</HI> to have been ignorant of any &s;uch Place as <HI>Britain,</HI> and that there never
<PB REF="19"> was, any Traffic or Communication betwixt the&s;e two Nations; yet &s;ince the <HI>Gauls</HI> &s;poke <HI>Greek,</HI> it is not very improbable but that the <HI>Britains</HI> might borrow from them. That the <HI>Gauls</HI> u&s;ed the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, we have the Te&s;timony of <HI>C&aelig;&s;ar;</HI> and it is very certain, that all the <HI>Grecian</HI> Learning flouri&s;hed at <HI>Mar&s;eils,</HI> which was an antient and famous &V;niver&s;ity, and is very much celebrated by all almo&s;t, both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Writers. And by this means, it may be rea&s;on|ably concluded, how the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Gauli&s;h Druids</HI> became acquainted with the <HI>Grecian</HI> Philo&s;ophy, which being as to all the different Sects and Opinions of it, taught at <HI>Mar&s;eils,</HI> the <HI>Druids</HI> more particularly ad|hered to the <HI>Pythagorean,</HI> to which the <HI>Druid</HI> Philo|&s;ophy hears a very near re&s;emblance, both as to the Do|ctrine of the <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the Tran&s;migration of the Soul, and the re&s;t of their My&s;tical <HI>Cabala,</HI> which they &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly kept &s;ecret and clo&s;e from the People.</P>
<P>But in oppo&s;ition to this, it may be with greater cer|tainty urged, that neither the <HI>Gauli&s;h</HI> nor <HI>Briti&s;h Druids</HI> had any Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Grecians,</HI> and con&s;equently could not borrow their Philo&s;ophical My&s;teries from them. For if <HI>C&aelig;&s;ar</HI> may be believed, <HI>The Art and Learning of the</HI> Druids <HI>was fir&s;t found out in</HI> Britain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. VI.</NOTE> <HI>and from thence is thought to be brought into</HI> Gaul; <HI>and at this time,</HI> as he goes on, <HI>&s;uch as will attain to the perfect knowledge of that Di&s;cipline, do for the mo&s;t part tra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">el thi|ther to learn it.</HI> Now if this be true, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Druids</HI> were the Inventors of this kind of Learn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters">g, and that the <HI>Gauls</HI> came over hither to be in&s;tructed in the Way and Method of it; I can &s;ee no rea&s;on, why they &s;hould have any communication with the <HI>Grecian</HI> Academy at <HI>Mar&s;eils,</HI> much le&s;s that they borrowed it from the Di&s;ciples of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince they accounted their My&s;teries &s;o Sacred, that they would communicate them to none, be&s;ides tho&s;e of their own Order. Nay, it may be better que&s;tioned, whe|ther
<PB REF="20"> <HI>Diuidi&s;m</HI> be not much <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ntienter than <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and antecedent to that <HI>Aera,</HI> when the <HI>Grecians</HI> began to Philo&s;ophize. And for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that the <HI>Druids</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> did not derive their Philo&s;ophy from <HI>Mar&s;eils,</HI> it will follow, that they could not borrow their Language; for if we &s;uppo&s;e, which is the mo&s;t we can, that the <HI>Gauls</HI> had &s;ome communication with tho&s;e <HI>Grecians,</HI> and upon that account that their Lan|guage was in &s;ome mea&s;ure mingled with the <HI>Greek;</HI> yet in their travel to <HI>Britain,</HI> they came not to commu|nicate, but to borrow; and 'tis not likely that the <HI>Bri|tains</HI> &s;hould be affected with the Language of tho&s;e who came to learn of them. Be&s;ides, of all the number of <HI>Gauli&s;h</HI> Words collected by <HI>Cambden,</HI> which agree with the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> few or none &s;eem to be of <HI>Greek</HI> De|rivation; &s;o it is highly improbable, as for as we can &s;ee into this Matter, that the <HI>Gauls</HI> &s;hould ever com|municate the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue to the <HI>Britains.</HI> And therefore, &s;ince this difficulty cannot be removed by any other way, it is not unrea&s;onable to &s;u&s;pect, that there is &s;ome real Foundation lodged in the Ruins of the Story of <HI>Brutus,</HI> and that the Truth is disfigured by the boundle&s;s acce&s;&s;ion of Poetical Invention.</P>
<P>I &s;hould tire the Reader, and exceed the ju&s;t bounds of what I at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, if I &s;hould take a particular view of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory publi&s;hed by <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> and therefore I &s;hall now only take notice of the Life of King <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> where the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Wales</HI> begins, and where a palpable Mi&s;take, I may call it Forgery, has been committed by one &s;ide or another. For the very &s;ame things, which the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory relate of <HI>Cadwalader,</HI> the <HI>Saxon</HI> Writers attribute to <HI>Ceadwalla</HI> King of the We&s;t <HI>Saxons,</HI> how he was driven by a Famine out of his Do|minions, came afterwards to <HI>Rome,</HI> and was received by Pope <HI>Sergius,</HI> with other particulars too tedious here to relate. But that which &s;eems to charge the Fault upon <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> or whoever el&s;e was the Author of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, is, that <HI>Bede</HI> an Author of e&s;tabli&s;hed Credit,
<PB REF="20"> and one who lived near tho&s;e times, &s;ays that it was the We&s;t <HI>Saxon</HI> King <HI>Ceadwalla</HI> that went to <HI>Rome</HI> in Pope <HI>Sergius</HI>'s time. But then on the other &s;ide, it is hardly conceivable, &s;uppo&s;ing the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory a perfect Contrivance, that <HI>Geoffrey</HI> or any other &s;hould be &s;o gro&s;ly over &s;een, as to borrow the Tran&s;action of a real King, and one &s;o well known, to make up the Life of a fictitious one cotemporary with him. <HI>Bede</HI>'s Reputation was too firm, to be &s;haken by an up&s;tart Hi&s;tory, and there|fore it cannot well be &s;uppo&s;ed that the Author of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory was &s;o unwary, in ca&s;e he de&s;igned a Cheat, as to let him&s;elf open to &s;o ea&s;y a detection of Forgery. All then that can be &s;aid, is, that the agree|ablene&s;s of the Names and time that the&s;e two Princes lived in, and po&s;&s;ibly their both going to <HI>Rome,</HI> which was not unu&s;ual in tho&s;e days, might without any de&s;ign of putting upon the World, make a confu&s;ion in their Hi&s;to|ries. But whether the Life of <HI>Cadwalader</HI> be a Fable, the Reader is at his own liberty to judge; it being pre|fixed to the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Wales,</HI> not as it is more Authen|tick, or any way of greater certainty than the re&s;t of <HI>Geof|frey</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, but only becau&s;e the Author <HI>Caradoc</HI> of <HI>Lhangarfan,</HI> began his continuace of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi+&s;tory with it.</P>
<P>This <HI>Caradoo</HI> of <HI>Lhangaifan,</HI> an Author of un|doubted Integrity, was cotemporary with <HI>Geoffrey,</HI> who taking his ri&s;e from the place where the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory concluded, made a continuation of it thro' the Reigns of &s;everal of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> till the Year <HI>1157.</HI> a|bout which time he flouri&s;hed. After him, all things of moment that happened in <HI>Wales,</HI> were kept and recorded in the Abbies of <HI>Conwey</HI> in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Y&s;trat|flur</HI> in <HI>South-Wales,</HI> where the Princes and Noblemen of <HI>Wales</HI> were buried, as appears by the Te&s;timony of <HI>Gutryn Owen,</HI> who lived in the time of <HI>Edward IV.</HI> and writ the mo&s;t exact and perfect Copy of the &s;ame. All the mo&s;t notable Occurrences being thus Regi&s;tred in the&s;e Abbies, were mo&s;t generally compared together every third

But his Death prevented what he purpo&s;ed, and &s;topped the publica|tion of this Hi&s;tory for a long time after, until <HI>David Powel</HI> D. D. in the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> having met with <HI>Humphrey Lloyd</HI>'s Tran&s;tation, collected what he could out of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians, which he added by way of Annotati|ons, and &s;o publi&s;hed it in the Year <HI>1584.</HI> This being the &s;ole Hi&s;tory of the Princes of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the only Edition of this Hi&s;tory, I was moved to prepare it for another Im|pre&s;&s;ion by a new modelling the Language, making the Body of the Hi&s;tory intire, without troubling the Reader to &s;ee the &s;ame thing by way of Annotation, Dr. <HI>Powel</HI>'s Notes being for the greate&s;t part but a repetition of the &s;ame matter of Fact out of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians, with what other Improve|ments could be made. The Additions which I made to the former Hi&s;tory, I chiefly, took out of the Notes of that late great Antiquarian Mr. <HI>Robert Vaughan</HI> of <HI>Hengwrt;</HI> by who&s;e help al&s;o I have corrected, &s;upplyed and continued the Chronology.

<P>And becau&s;e the Name of this Country is changed, or rather mi&s;taken by the Inhabitants of <HI>England,</HI> and not by them called <HI>Cambry,</HI> but <HI>Wales:</HI> I think it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to declare the occa&s;ion thereof, which is, that where the <HI>Saxons</HI> a People of <HI>Germany</HI> were the fir&s;t that after the <HI>Britains</HI> inhabited and ruled the greate&s;t part of this I&s;le, and drove the <HI>Britains</HI> to that Cor|ner, which according to the manner of their Country they called <HI>Wales,</HI> and the People <HI>Welch-men,</HI> and the Tongue <HI>Welch,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Strange, or not of them under&s;tood.

<PB N="2" REF="34"> Progre&s;s, and to prevent their Incur&s;ions into the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Province. The <HI>Britains</HI> perceiving their antient and implacable Enemies to fall upon them, and finding them&s;elves far too weak to repel their Endle&s;s Deva|&s;tations; with a lamentable Narrative of their own Mi&s;eries, and the cruel Oppre&s;&s;ions of their Enemies, they &s;ent over to <HI>Gaul,</HI> imploring Aid of <HI>Aetius</HI> Praefect of that Province; who, being moved with the de|plorable Condition of the <HI>Britains,</HI> di&s;patch'd over a Legion under the Command of <HI>Gallio,</HI> which unexpe|ctedly &s;urpri&s;ing the <HI>Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots,</HI> forced them, with great Lo&s;s and De&s;truction, to retire over the Seas or Friths to their own Habitations.

<P>The <HI>Britains</HI> al&s;o might po&s;&s;ibly be too much taken with this &s;edentary and unactive Life; and as long as they lived Secure under the Protection of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, they little feared their Countrey would be|come a Prey to any barbarous Nation. No one would have imagined that that Glorious Empire would be &s;o &s;oon cru&s;hed to pieces, which could not otherwi&s;e be effected, than by the in&s;upportable pre&s;|&s;ure of its own Weight. This apprehen&s;ion of the Greatne&s;s and Strength of the <HI>Romans,</HI> made the <HI>Bri|tains</HI> probably le&s;s &s;olicitous of enabling them&s;elves to Defend their Countrey, not thinking they would ever for&s;ake and relinqui&s;h the Province of <HI>Britain.</HI> But to their Sorrow they experienc'd the contrary, the Affairs of the Empire el&s;ewhere requiring the Help of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Legions, &s;o that they were left expo&s;ed to the Cruelties of the <HI>Northern</HI> Invaders, having not as yet recovered any Power or Conduct to oppo&s;e them.

For tho' a con|tinued Peace be in it &s;elf de&s;irable, yet oftentimes no|thing tends more to the future Ruin and Downfal of a Nation.

Indeed, they had been wrong|fully kept out of the Government of <HI>North Wales</HI> during the Reign of <HI>Howel;</HI> in who&s;e time the reco|very of their own was impracticable, by rea&s;on that for his Moderation and other good Qualities, he had attracted to him&s;elf the univer&s;al Love of all the <HI>Welch.</HI> But now, he being gone, they are re&s;olved to revenge the Injury received by him upon his Sons; and upon a

A very cruel Battel en&s;ued upon this, and a very great number were &s;lain on both &s;ides, among whom were <HI>Anarawd</HI> the Son of <HI>Gwyriad,</HI> the Son of <HI>Roderic</HI> the Great; and <HI>Edwyn</HI> the Son of <HI>Howel Dha.</HI> But the Victory plainly favoured the Brothers <HI>Ievaf</HI> and <HI>Iago;</HI> &s;o that the Princes of <HI>South-Wales</HI> were obliged to re|tire to <HI>Cardigan&s;hire,</HI> whither they were warmly pur|&s;ued, and that Country cruelly harra&s;s'd with Fire and Sword.

And now being a&s;&s;ured of Treachery in the ca&s;e, and finding that his Men had fled for their Lives, he endeavour'd all he could to make his e&s;cape; but <HI>Gwgan</HI> and his Company were too quick for him; and &s;o being &s;ecured, they &s;trangled him, and deliver'd his Body to the <HI>Normans,</HI> who having cut off his Head, convey'd it to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Rydcors.</HI> This mo&s;t villainous Murther, &s;o barbarou&s;ly commit|ted upon the King's Lieutenant, was not in the lea&s;t taken notice of; for King <HI>Henry</HI> was &s;o unrea&s;ona|bly prejudiced in favour of the <HI>Normans,</HI> that whate|ver Mi&s;demeanour, be it of never &s;o high a nature, was by them committed, it was pre&s;ently winked at, and let fall to the ground; whereas, if the <HI>Welch</HI> tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed but again&s;t the lea&s;t injunction of the King's Laws, they were mo&s;t &s;everely puni&s;hed: which was the cau&s;e that they afterwards &s;tood up again&s;t the King in their own defence, being by experience a&s;&s;ured, that he minded nothing more than their utter De&s;truction.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>An&s;elm,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> convened a Synod at <HI>London,</HI> wherein among other Injunctions then decreed, the Celibacy of the Clergy was enjoyned; Marriage being before ever allowed of in <HI>Britain,</HI> to them in Holy Orders. But this new Injunction created a great deal of Heat and Animo&s;ities among the Clergy, &s;ome approving of it
<PB N="128" REF="101"> as rea&s;onable and orthodoxical; others condemning it, as an innovation, and contrary to the plain Letter of Scripture. But during the&s;e Di&s;putes between the Clergy, King <HI>Henry</HI> being now in the Fifth Year of his Reign, &s;ailed over with a great Army into <HI>Normandy</HI> where his Brother <HI>Robert,</HI> together with <HI>Robert de Bele&s;mo, Arnulph,</HI> and <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Mor|taign,</HI> gave him battel; but the King having obtain|ed the Victory, took the Duke his Brother, with <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Mortaign,</HI> Pri&s;oners; and carrying them into <HI>England,</HI> he cau&s;ed fir&s;t his Brother <HI>Robert</HI>'s Eyes to be plucked out, and then condemned them <MILESTONE N="1104" UNIT="A.D."> both to perpetual impri&s;onment in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Car|dyff.</HI> About the &s;ame time <HI>Meyric</HI> and <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Trahaern ap Caradoc</HI> were both &s;lain by the means of <HI>Owen ap Cadogan ap Blethyn;</HI> who&s;e Un|cle <HI>Meredith ap Blethyn,</HI> who had been Pri&s;oner for a long time in <HI>England,</HI> now brake open the Pri&s;on, wherein he was very narrowly confined; and return|ing to his own Country, had his E&s;tate re&s;tored, which afterwards he quietly enjoyed.</P>
<P><MILESTONE N="1105" UNIT="A.D."> The next Year a very di&s;mal and calamitous Ac|cident happening in the Low-Countries, proved ve|ry incommodious and prejudicial to the <HI>Welch;</HI> for a great part of <HI>Flanders</HI> being drowned by the over|flowing of the Sea, the Inhabitants were compell d to &s;eek for &s;ome other Country to dwell in, their own being now covered with Water. And there|fore a great many being come over to <HI>England,</HI> they reque&s;ted of King <HI>Henry</HI> to a&s;&s;ign them &s;ome part of his Kingdom which was empty and void of Inha|bitants, where they might &s;ettle and plant them&s;elves.

And fora&s;much as <HI>Gwladys,</HI> Wife to <HI>Rhys ap Theodore,</HI> and Mother to <HI>Ne&s;t,</HI> was the Daughter of <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">walhon ap Confyn,</HI> Co&s;in-German to <HI>Cadwgan</HI> his Father; under pretence of Friend&s;hip and Relation, he made bold to pay her a Vi&s;it. But finding the truth far to &s;urpa&s;s the Fame that went of her, he returned home &s;o inflam'd with her Charms, that not being able to keep the Ma&s;tery over him&s;elf, he went back again the very &s;ame night, and being attended by a company of wild, head-&s;trong Youths, they privily entered into the Ca&s;tle, and encompa&s;|&s;ing the Chamber about, where <HI>Gerald</HI> and his Wife lay, they &s;et the Hou&s;e on fire. <HI>Gerald</HI> hearing a noi&s;e, would fain go out to know the meaning of &s;uch un&s;ea&s;onable Di&s;turbance; but his Wife fearing &s;ome Treachery, per&s;uaded him to make as private an E|&s;cape as he could; and then pulling up a Board in the Privy, let him go that way. Then returning to her Chamber, &s;he would fain a&s;&s;ure tho&s;e notorious Youths, that there was no body be&s;ides her &s;elf and Children there; but this being not &s;atifactory, they forcibly broke in, and having &s;earched every the mo&s;t private Corner, and not finding <HI>Gerald,</HI> they took his Wife and two Sons, with a Son and a Daughter born by a Concubine, and carried them away to <HI>Powys;</HI> ha|ving fir&s;t &s;et fire to the Ca&s;tle, and de&s;troyed the Country as they went along. <HI>Cadwgan, Owen</HI>'s Fa|ther, hearing of what outragious Crime his Son had committed, was exceedingly concerned and &s;orry, chiefly becau&s;e hereby he was like to incur King

But when <HI>Richard</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> whom King <HI>Henry</HI> had con&s;tituted War|den of the Marches, being now at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> heard of this, he &s;ent for <HI>Ithel</HI> and <HI>Madoc</HI> the Sons of <HI>Ryryd ap Blethyn,</HI> Per&s;ons of great Power and Intere&s;t in <HI>Wales,</HI> promi&s;ing them very con&s;iderable Reward, be|&s;ides the Government of the whole Country, in ca&s;e they could bring <HI>Owen</HI> and his Father <HI>Cadwgan</HI> either dead or alive, to him, that he might revenge that hainous Affront which they had done to the King of <HI>England.</HI> With them he joyned <HI>Lhywarch</HI> the Son of <HI>Trahaern ap Caradoc,</HI> who&s;e two Brethren <HI>Owen</HI> had &s;lain, and <HI>&V;chtryd</HI> the Son of <HI>Edwyn;</HI> which Four un|dertook to an&s;wer effectually the Bi&s;hop's Propo&s;al to them. But when they had united their Forces, and began in an ho&s;tile manner to de&s;troy the Country as they pa&s;&s;ed along; <HI>&V;chtryd</HI> &s;ent private notice before him, requiring all who were any way de&s;irous of their own Safety, to come to him; becau&s;e no Quarters was to be given to any that was found in the Country.

The like fate befel them who e&s;ca|ped to <HI>Arustly</HI> and <HI>Melienyth;</HI> for <HI>Walter</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford</HI> having rai&s;ed an Army in defence of the Town of <HI>Caermyrdhyn,</HI> before he could come thither, accidentally met with the&s;e &s;tragling Fugitives, and
<PB N="131" REF="102"> knowing what Country they belonged to, without any further Ceremony, he fell upon them, and put mo&s;t of them to the Sword. But they who fled to <HI>Stradtywy,</HI> were gently received by <HI>Meredith ap Ry|therch,</HI> and &s;uch as re&s;orted to <HI>&V;chtryd,</HI> were kindly entertained by him; and &s;o he marched with the re&s;t of his Confederates to <HI>Rydcors</HI> Ca&s;tle; it being the general opinion, that it was be&s;t to enter the Country by Night, and to take <HI>Cadwgan</HI> and <HI>Owen</HI> his Son by &s;urprize. But <HI>&V;chtryd</HI> reflecting upon the Difficulty of the Country, and how ea&s;ily they might be en|trapp'd by an Ambu&s;cade, di&s;&s;uaded them from any &s;uch nocturnal Undertakings; and told them, that it was far more advi&s;able to enter the Country in good order, when the light gave the Soldiers opportunity to keep and ob&s;erve their ranks. But whil&s;t they were thus con&s;idering of the mo&s;t effectual way to carry on their purpo&s;e, <HI>Owen</HI> got a Ship at <HI>Aberdyfi,</HI> bound for <HI>Ireland;</HI> and e&s;caping thither, avoided the nar|row &s;earch that was the following day made for them. But when neither Father nor Son could be found, all the fault was laid upon <HI>&V;chtryd,</HI> who had di&s;&s;uaded them from falling upon the Ca&s;tle unexpectedly; and there|fore all they could do, &s;ince their e&s;cape, was to burn and de&s;troy the Country; which they did effectually, excepting the two Sanctuaries of <HI>Lhanpadarn</HI> and <HI>Lhandewi Brefi;</HI> out of which however they took &s;e|veral Per&s;ons who had e&s;caped thither, and carried them away Pri&s;oners to their &s;everal Countries. But <HI>Owen,</HI> with them who were acce&s;&s;ary to the burning of <HI>Rydcors</HI> Ca&s;tle, being fled into <HI>Ireland,</HI> de&s;ired the Umbrage and Protection of King <HI>Murcart;</HI> who re|ceived him very gladly, upon the account of their for|mer acquaintance; for <HI>Owen,</HI> during the War be|twixt the Earls of <HI>Arundel</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and the <HI>Welch,</HI> had fled to King <HI>Murcart,</HI> and brought him very rich Pre&s;ents from <HI>Wales. Cadwgan</HI> all this while lay pri|vately in <HI>Powys;</HI> but thinking it impo&s;&s;ible to conti|nue there long undi&s;covered, he adjudged it his wi&s;er way to &s;end to King <HI>Henry,</HI> and to declare his Inno|cency and Abhorrence of that Fact which his Son had
<PB N="132" REF="103"> committed. The King was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded that the old Man was guiltle&s;s, and wholly ignorant of his Son's Crime; and therefore he gave him permi&s;&s;ion to remain in the Country, and to enjoy the Town and Lands he received by his Wife, who was the Daughter of a <HI>Norman</HI> Lord, called <HI>Pygot de Say.</HI> But his Lands in <HI>Powys</HI> were otherwi&s;e di&s;tributed; for his Nephews <HI>Madoc</HI> and <HI>Ithel,</HI> finding what Cir|cum&s;tances their Uncle <HI>Cadwgan</HI> lay under, upon the account of his Son <HI>Owen;</HI> they divided betwixt them|&s;elves &s;uch Lands as he and his Son po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in <HI>Powys,</HI> though afterwards they could never agree about the equal di&s;tribution of it. To counter-ballance this, <HI>Cadwgan</HI> made &s;uch Friends to the King of <HI>England,</HI> that upon paying the Fine of 100 <HI>l.</HI> he had a grant of all his Lands in <HI>Cardigan,</HI> and a power to recall all the Inhabitants, who had rubb'd off upon the publication of the King's late Order, That no <HI>Welch|man</HI> or <HI>Norman</HI> &s;hould dwell in <HI>Cardigan.</HI> Upon in|formation of this grant to <HI>Cadwgan,</HI> &s;everal of them that retired to <HI>Ireland</HI> returned again privately to <HI>Wales,</HI> and lurkingly remained with their Friends; but <HI>Owen</HI> dur&s;t not appear in <HI>Cardigan,</HI> by rea&s;on that his Father had received that Country from King <HI>Hen|ry,</HI> upon condition that he would never entertain or receive his Son, nor by any means &s;uccour him either with Men or Money. Neverthele&s;s, <HI>Owen</HI> came to <HI>Powys,</HI> and would fain be reconciled to the King, and make an Attonement for his late Mi&s;demeanour; but he could find no body that would venture to &s;peak in his behalf, nor make the King acquainted with his de&s;ire and willingne&s;s, to &s;ubmit. And thus being hopele&s;s and full of De&s;pair, he could not po&s;&s;ibly di|vine which way to turn him&s;elf; till at la&s;t, a very unexpected opportunity offered him means and occa|&s;ion to oppo&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The matter was this, there happened a Difference betwixt <HI>Madoc ap R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ryd</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> Lieutenant of the Marches of <HI>Wales,</HI> about certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Felons, who being under the Protection of <HI>Madoc,</HI> he would not re|&s;tore at the Bi&s;hop's reque&s;t. The Bi&s;hop being much

<P>The&s;e home-bread Di&s;turbances being pretty well abated, a greater &s;torm aro&s;e from abroad; for the <MILESTONE N="1111" UNIT="A.D."> next Year, King <HI>Henry</HI> prepared a mighty Army to en|ter into <HI>Wales,</HI> being provoked thereto by the reque&s;t

But <HI>Owen</HI> fearing to commit him&s;elf to tho&s;e whom he knew &s;o greedily to covet his E&s;tate, and whom he was a&s;&s;ured were far more de&s;irous to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Welch</HI> of their Lands, than any other way to puni&s;h them for former Crimes and Mi&s;car|riages, fled to <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> to <HI>North-Wales.</HI> Up|on that, King <HI>Henry</HI> converted his whole Force that

But the Prince was too well acquainted with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Promi&s;es, and therefore refu&s;ed his Propo&s;als; and &s;o King <HI>Henry</HI> being very unwilling to return with|out doing &s;omething in this Expedition, &s;ent to <HI>Owen</HI> to for&s;ake the Prince, who was not able to defend him&s;elf, but was ready to &s;trike a Peace with the <HI>Scot|ti&s;h</HI> King and the Earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> But this cunning In|&s;inuation would not take effect; for <HI>Owen</HI> was for his life as di&s;tru&s;tful of King <HI>Henry</HI> as Prince <HI>Gruffydh;</HI> and therefore he would hearken to no Intreaties for re|volting from him, who had all this while afforded him Refuge, till at length his Uncle <HI>Meredith,</HI> an old in|&s;inuating Politician, per&s;uaded him, with much a do, not to for&s;ake the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Propo&s;als, who offered him all his Lands without Tribute, in ca&s;e he would come to his &s;ide; and therefore <HI>Meredith</HI> ad|vi&s;ed him in&s;tantly to accept of his offer, before Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> made a Peace with the King, which if it was once done, he would be glad upon any &s;core to purcha&s;e the King's Mercy. <HI>Owen</HI> being prevailed up|on by &s;uch Arguments, came to the King, who re|ceived him very gratiou&s;ly, and told him, that becau&s;e he believed his Promi&s;e, he would not only perform that, but likewi&s;e exalt him above any of his Kindred, and grant him his Lands free from any payment of Tribute. Prince <HI>Gruffydh</HI> perceiving how that <HI>Owen</HI> had &s;ubmitted to the King, thought it al&s;o his wi&s;e&s;t way to &s;ue for Peace; and &s;o promi&s;ing the King a great Sum of Money, a Peace was then actually agreed upon, and confirmed; which the King of

On the other hand, <HI>Meredith</HI> going in Per&s;on to his Nephew <HI>Owen,</HI> affirmed for Truth, that the Prince and the Earl of <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> were actually agreed, and that the Prince was on his Jour|ney to the King to make his Submi&s;&s;ion. And in the mean while <HI>Meredith</HI> took e&s;pecial care that all Me&s;&s;engers betwixt the Prince and <HI>Owen</HI> &s;hould be intercepted, and by that means <HI>Owen</HI> wilfully &s;ub|mitted him&s;elf to the King.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> having thus fini&s;hed and brought to an end all his Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Wales,</HI> calling <HI>Owen</HI> to him, told him, that in ca&s;e he would go over with him to <HI>Normandy,</HI> and there be faithful to him, he would upon his return confirm all his Promi&s;es upon him; and &s;o <HI>Owen</HI> accepting of the King's Offer, went with him to <HI>Normandy,</HI> where he behaved him&s;elf &s;o gal|lantly, that he was made a Knight; and after his re|turn <MILESTONE N="1112" UNIT="A.D."> the Year following, he had all his Lands and E|&s;tate confirmed unto him. About the &s;ame time <HI>Griffri</HI> Bi&s;hop of St. <HI>Davids</HI> died, and King <HI>Henry</HI> ap|pointed to &s;ucceed him one <HI>Barnard</HI> a <HI>Norman,</HI> much again&s;t the Good-will and Inclination of the <HI>Welch,</HI> who before this time were ever u&s;ed to Elect their own Bi&s;hop. And this Year the rumour of <HI>Gruffydh</HI> Son to <HI>Rhys ap Theodore</HI> was &s;pread throughout <HI>South-Wales,</HI> who, as the report went, for fear of the King had been from a Child brought up in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and having come over about two Years afore, pa&s;t his time privately among his Relations, particularly
<PB N="143" REF="108"> with <HI>Gerald</HI> Steward of <HI>Pembroke</HI> his Brother-in-Law. And now the noi&s;e of a new Prince being &s;pread a|broad, it came at la&s;t to the Ears of the King of <HI>England,</HI> that a certain Per&s;on appeared in <HI>Wales,</HI> who pretended to be the Son of <HI>Rhys ap Theodore</HI> late Prince of <HI>South Wales,</HI> and laid Claim to that Prin|cipality, which was now in the King's Hands. King <HI>Henry</HI> being &s;omewhat concerned with &s;uch a Report, and fearing le&s;t that this new Starter &s;hould create him &s;ome greater trouble, he thought to nip him in the bud, and &s;ent down Orders to apprehend him.

A little after, his Brother <HI>Howel</HI> who was impri&s;oned by <HI>Ardulph</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> where he had remained for a great while, made his e&s;cape and fled to his Brother, then with <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan</HI> in <HI>North-Wales.</HI> But King <HI>Henry</HI> being informed that <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> and his Brother <HI>Howel</HI> were enter|tained by the Prince of <HI>North-Wales,</HI> &s;ent very &s;mooth Letters to <HI>Gruffydh ap Conan,</HI> de&s;iring to &s;peak with him, who being come, he received him with all the Tokens of Honor and Friend&s;hip, and be&s;towed upon him very rich Pre&s;ents, ju&s;t after the <HI>Norman</HI> Policy, who u&s;ually make very much of tho&s;e whom they de&s;ign afterwards to be &s;erviceable to them.

And then returning with a great deal of Spoil and Booty to his u&s;ual re&s;idence at <HI>Stratywy;</HI> his Forces were con&s;iderably increa&s;ed by the acce&s;&s;ion of many &s;tout young Men, who came to him from all Quar|ters, and thought that Fortune &s;o pro&s;pered his Arms, that no body was able to &s;tand before him. After this he marched to <HI>Gwyr,</HI> but <HI>William de Londres</HI> thinking it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;tand before him, for&s;ook the Ca&s;tle with all his Men in all ha&s;te, &s;o that when <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was come thither, he found a great deal of Cattel and Spoil, and none to own them, and there|fore having burnt down the Ca&s;tle, he carried away every thing of Value in the Country. When the <HI>Cardigan-&s;hire</HI> Men heard how fortunately he &s;uc|ceeded in all his Attempts, and being extreamly fearful, le&s;t his next Expedition &s;hould be again&s;t them, &s;ent to him, de&s;iring him, as being their near Relation and Country man, to take upon him the Rule and Government over them. <HI>Gruffydh</HI> willing|ly accepted of their Offer, and coming thither, was joyfully received by the Chief Men in the Country, who were <HI>Cadifor ap Grono, Howel ap Dinerth,</HI> and <HI>Trahaern ap Ithel,</HI> which three Per&s;ons had for&s;aken <HI>Dyfed,</HI> by rea&s;on that it was &s;o thwacked with <HI>Nor|mans, Flemings</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men. Nor was <HI>Cardigan</HI> free from Strangers, who pretended to &s;way and rule the Country, but the People bearing in mind the continual Wrong and Oppre&s;&s;ion they received from them, bore an inveterate hatred to them, and were very glad to be delivered from their in&s;olent and imperious Oppre&s;&s;ours. For King <HI>Henry</HI> what by Force and Bani&s;hment of tho&s;e that &s;tood up &s;tiff for their Liberty, and what by corrupting of tho&s;e that were wavering, had brought all that Country to his &s;ubjection, and be&s;towed what Lands he thought fit upon his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Norman</HI> Favourites.

<PB N="147" REF="110"> the Strength of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in this Coun|try, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> was not a whit ca&s;t down, but boldly coming on to <HI>Cardigan I&s;coed,</HI> he laid Siege to a Fort that Earl <HI>Gilbert</HI> and the <HI>Flemings</HI> had built at a place called <HI>Blaen Porth Gwythan.</HI> After divers A&s;&s;aults, and the killing of &s;everal of the be&s;ieged, with the lo&s;s only of one of his Men, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> took the place, and ra&s;ing it to the ground, brought all the Country thereabouts to &s;ubjection. This Action proved very fatal to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for immediately upon this, they began to for&s;ake their Hou&s;es and Habitations, as thinking it too hot for them to &s;tay any longer in the Country, and &s;o the <HI>Welch</HI> burnt and de&s;troyed as far as <HI>Penwedic</HI> all the Hou&s;es of tho&s;e Strangers whom Earl <HI>Gilbert</HI> had brought with him. Then <HI>Gruffydh</HI> be&s;ieged the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Stradpythylh</HI> which belonged to <HI>Ralph</HI> Earl <HI>Gilbert</HI>'s Steward, and having made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, he put all the Garri&s;on to the Sword.

And here it may be ob&s;erved, that not only Men enjoyed the Privilege of the&s;e Sanctuaries, but al&s;o Cattel and Hor&s;es, and whatever el&s;e lived within the Liberties of them. But the day following, <HI>Gruffydh</HI> marched di&s;orderly towards the Ca&s;tle, being apprehen&s;ive of no great oppo&s;ition, by rea&s;on that he was ignorant of the number of the Garri&s;on, and &s;o encamping upon an oppo&s;ite Hill, which was divided from the Ca&s;tle by a River, with a Bridge over it, he called a Council to determin with what Engines they might with be&s;t Succe&s;s play again&s;t it, and &s;o make a ge|neral, A&s;&s;ault. The <HI>Normans</HI> ob&s;erving their Di&s;|order, very cunningly &s;ent out &s;ome of their Archers to skirmi&s;h with them, and &s;o by little and little to entice them to the Bridge, where &s;ome of the be&s;t armed Hor&s;e-men were ready to i&s;&s;ue out upon them.

The <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> &s;eeing this, fled towards the Ca&s;tle, and the <HI>Welch</HI> with all &s;peed followed them to the top of the Hill; but whil&s;t they thought that the day was their own, up ri&s;es a Party of Hor&s;e which lay in ambu&s;cade under the Hill, and &s;tanding be|twixt the <HI>Welch</HI> and the Bridg, prevented any Suc|cour to come to them.

<P>When King <HI>Henry</HI> was informed of all the Mi&s;|chief and Cruelties that <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> had com|mitted among his Subjects in <HI>Wales,</HI> he &s;ent for <HI>Owen ap Cadwgan,</HI> de&s;iring him and <HI>Lhywarch ap Trahaern</HI> to u&s;e all the effectual Method po&s;&s;ible to take or kill the Arch Rebel <HI>Gruffydh,</HI> promi&s;ing very &s;peedily to &s;end his Son <HI>Robert</HI> with an Army to <HI>Wales</HI> for that purpo&s;e. <HI>Owen</HI> being very proud that the King put &s;uch Confidence in him, encouraged his Men to be now &s;o indu&s;trious to merit the King's Favour, as they had been formerly to de&s;erve his Di&s;plea&s;ure; and &s;o joyning his Forces with <HI>Lhywarch,</HI> they both marched to meet Prince <HI>Robert</HI> at <HI>Stratywy,</HI> where they &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> had hid him&s;elf in the Woods.

Then <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Lhywarch</HI> &s;eparated with di&s;tinct Parties to &s;cour the Woods, which about <HI>Stratywy</HI> are very de&s;ertous; and <HI>Owen</HI> having entred with an Hundred Men, pre&s;ently di&s;covered the tract of Men and Cattel, and follow'd their Foot-&s;teps &s;o clo&s;e, that within a little while he overtook them; and having &s;lain a great many of them, and put the re&s;t to flight, he carried away all their Cattel back to his Army.

But he found, that a private Quar|rel is &s;ometime more regarded than the publick Good; and therefore when <HI>Gerald</HI> was advanced within bow|&s;hot, he greeted him with a Volloy of Arrows, to &s;hew how great a Friend he was; but <HI>Owen,</HI> tho per&s;uaded to flee, was &s;o little terrified at &s;uch an un|welcom Salutation, that tho' the Enemy were Seven to One, yet he told them, that they were but <HI>Flemings,</HI> and &s;uch as always trembled at the hearing of his Name. And then falling on with a great deal of Courage, he was at the fir&s;t On-let &s;truck with an Arrow into the Heart, of which Wound he pre&s;ently

<P><MILESTONE N="1146" UNIT="A.D."> The next Year, <HI>Cadelh, Meredith,</HI> and <HI>Rhys,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Gruffydh ap Rhys ap Theodor,</HI> brought an Ar|my before the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Gwys;</HI> but finding them&s;elves too weak to ma&s;ter it, they de&s;ired <HI>Howel,</HI> Son to Prince <HI>Owen Gwynedh,</HI> a Per&s;on famou&s;ly remarkable for martial Endowments, to come to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. <HI>Howel,</HI> who was ever very de&s;irous to &s;ignalize him|&s;elf, and to evidence his Valour to the World, rea|dily con&s;ented to their Reque&s;t; and having drawn his Forces together, marched directly towards <HI>Gwys,</HI> where being arrived, he was joyfully received, and honourably entertain'd by &s;uch Lords as de&s;ired his help. Having viewed the Strength and Fortification of the Ca&s;tle, he found it was impracticable to take the place, without the Walls could be de&s;troyed; and therefore he gave orders, that certain battering

Shortly after this a great Difference happen'd betwixt the Sons of Prince <HI>Owen, Howel,</HI> and <HI>Conan,</HI> and their Uncle <HI>Cadwalader;</HI> whereupon the former entered with an Army into the Country of <HI>Merionyth,</HI> and committed great Wa&s;tes and Ho&s;tilities there, in&s;o|much that the Inhabitants flock'd into Sanctuaries to &s;ave their Lives. But the young Lords finding what fearful and un&s;table condition the People were in, and the better to draw them to their &s;ide, i&s;&s;ued out their Proclamation, a&s;&s;uring that all who would fa|vour their Country, &s;hould not only enjoy their Lives, but their former Liberty and accu&s;tomed Priviledges; upon the publication of which Edict, the People re|turned to their own Habitations.

The Lords finding they could do no good by Threats and Menaces, judged it more convenient to make u&s;e of the other Extream; and therefore promi&s;ed the Abbot a very high Reward, if he would deliver the Ca&s;tle into their hands. But all proved to no effect, the Abbot being a Per&s;on of more Hone&s;ty and greater Honour, than to be corrupted to betray his Tru&s;t; told them flatly, That he would not de|ceive his Ma&s;ters expectation, and therefore would choo&s;e rather to dye with Honour, than to live with Shame. The Lords finding him inexorable, and withal
<PB N="168" REF="121"> being vexed, that a Church-man &s;hould put &s;uch a &s;top to their fortunate Proceedings, made &s;uch a vi|gorous A&s;&s;ault upon the Ca&s;tle, that after they had pulled down &s;ome part of the Walls, they entred in by force, and ravaged &s;o furiou&s;ly, that they killed and wounded the whole Garri&s;on, the <HI>Abbot</HI> only e|&s;caping, who by the help of &s;ome of his Friends in <HI>Howel</HI>'s Army, got away &s;afe.

At the &s;ame time, <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> built a Ca&s;tle at <HI>Cae|reneon</HI> near <HI>Cymer,</HI> and then <HI>Eglwys Fair</HI> in <HI>Myfot,</HI>

<P>The &s;ame Year King <HI>Henry</HI> being di&s;plea&s;ed with the <HI>Flemings</HI> whom his Predece&s;&s;or King <HI>Stephen</HI> had brought over into <HI>England,</HI> i&s;&s;ued out a Proclama|tion, charging the greate&s;t part of them to depart his Dominions, and to retire to their Country-men in <HI>We&s;t-Wales,</HI> where his Grandfather <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t the <HI>Ba&s;tard</HI>'s Son had planted them. And thus that part of <HI>Wales</HI> called <HI>Pembroke-&s;hire,</HI> was over-run with the&s;e Strangers, who being better befriended by the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> than the <HI>Welch</HI> could well ex|pect to be, made &s;ure footing in that Country, where they have ever &s;ince continued firm. It was the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Policy of tho&s;e times to accept of any oppor|tunity to curb and keep under the <HI>Welch,</HI> whom they experienced to be none of the &s;afe&s;t Neighbours, and therefore the Kings of <HI>England</HI> did grant any Lands and Privileges in <HI>Wales</HI> to any that would accept of them, which hone&s;tly they had no Power to be&s;tow.</P>
<P>But this was not enough in detriment to the <HI>Welch,</HI><MILESTONE N="1156" UNIT="A.D."> for the Year following, King <HI>Henry</HI> rai&s;ed a very great Army which he gathered from all parts of <HI>En|gland,</HI> with purpo&s;e to &s;ubdue all <HI>North-Wales,</HI> being principally moved hereto, by the in&s;tigation of <HI>Cad|walader</HI> the Prince's Brother, whom <HI>Owen Gwynedh,</HI> for what Rea&s;ons not known, deprived of his E&s;tate, and bani&s;hed the Country.

The King of <HI>England</HI> accepting of their Propo&s;als, led his Army to <HI>We&s;t-Che&s;ter,</HI> and encamped upon the Mar&s;h called <HI>Saltney,</HI> in <HI>Welch, Morfa-Caer-Lleon.</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI> all this while was not ignorant of this intended Inva&s;ion, and therefore
<PB N="174" REF="124"> having made all po&s;&s;ible Preparations to confront the Enemy, he marched his Army to the Frontiers of <HI>England,</HI> and encamping at <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk,</HI> re&s;olved to give the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Battel. King <HI>Henry</HI> under&s;tanding of the Prince's Re&s;olution, detached &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t Troops out of the Main-body, under the command of &s;everal Earls and other Lords, and &s;ent them towards the Prince's Camp. But after they had advanced &s;ome little way, and were pa&s;&s;ing thro' a Wood, called <HI>Coed-Eulo, David</HI> and <HI>Conan</HI> Prince <HI>Owen</HI>'s Sons, unexpectedly &s;et upon them, and what by the advantage of the Ground, and the &s;ud|dene&s;s of the Action, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were born down with a great Slaughter, and tho&s;e who &s;urvived, nar|rowly e&s;caped to the King's Camp.

But the Prince fore|&s;eeing the Danger of this, retired with his Army to a place called <HI>C&icirc;l Owen,</HI> that is, <HI>Owen</HI>'s Retreat, which when King <HI>Henry</HI> perceived, he let fall his De|&s;ign,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 2. <HI>Cap.</HI> 5.</NOTE> and came to <HI>Ruthlan.

<P>After this Prince <HI>Owen</HI> decamped from <HI>C&icirc;l Owen,</HI> and intrenched him&s;elf upon <HI>Bryn y Pin,</HI> where lit|tle of moment pa&s;&s;ed betwixt the two Armies, only &s;ome &s;light Skirmi&s;hes happened frequently. King
<PB N="175" REF="124"> <HI>Henry</HI> in the mean time fortified the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> and during his &s;tay there, <HI>Madoc ap Meredith</HI> Prince of <HI>Powis,</HI> &s;ailed with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet to <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> and having put &s;ome Men on &s;hoar, they burnt two Churches, and ravaged part of the Country about.

But they on Board quickly perceived what had happened, and therefore thought it not very &s;afe harbouring upon that Coa&s;t, but judging it more advi&s;able to weigh Anchor, they pre&s;ently &s;et Sail for <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> when they were arrived thither, they found that a Peace was actually concluded betwixt King <HI>Henry</HI> and Prince <HI>Owen</HI> upon the&s;e Articles; That <HI>Cadwalader</HI> &s;hould have all his Lands re&s;tored to him, and he re|ceived to the Favour and Friend&s;hip of his Brother. Then King <HI>Henry</HI> leaving the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Ruthlan</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ingwerk</HI> well manned and fortified, and having near the latter founded a Publick Structure for the Order of Knights Templars, returned to <HI>England.</HI> But the troubles of <HI>Wales</HI> did not end with him, for <HI>Iorwerdh Goch ap Meredith</HI> who had taken part with the King of <HI>England</HI> during this War, laid Siege to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Yale,</HI> which was built by Prince <HI>Owen,</HI> and making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it, ra&s;ed it to the ground.</P>
<P>The next Year commenced with a very unfortu|nate <MILESTONE N="1157" UNIT="A.D."> Action, <HI>Ifor ap Meyric</HI> having long before ca&s;t a very wi&s;hful Eye upon the Land and E&s;tate of <HI>Morgan ab Owen,</HI> was now re&s;olved to put in exe|cution what he had before contrived; and as Co|vetou&s;ne&s;s &s;eldom bears any regard to Vertue or Honor, he treacherou&s;ly &s;et upon him, and &s;lew him; and with him fell <HI>Gurgan ap Rhys,</HI> the mo&s;t Famous <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Poet of his time. <HI>Morgan</HI>'s E&s;tate <HI>Ifor</HI> be&s;towed upon his Brother <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> who about the &s;ame time got al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Town of <HI>Caer-Lheon.</HI> But the&s;e inward and home-bread Di|&s;turbances
<PB N="176" REF="125"> were quickly mitigated by a general Peace which was pre&s;ently after this concluded betwixt the King of <HI>England</HI> and all the Princes and Lords of <HI>Wales, Rhys ab Gruffydh ap Rhys</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales</HI> only excepted. For this Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> who probably would not rely too far upon the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Fidelity, refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to a Peace; but however, to &s;ecure him&s;elf the be&s;t he could from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whom he had no &s;mall rea&s;on to be afraid of, he thought it his be&s;t Prudence to i&s;&s;ue out his Orders, commanding his Subjects to remove their Cattel and other Effects to the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Tywy,</HI> where they were like to remain &s;ecure&s;t from the Eyes and reach of the Enemies. But he had not continued there long, when he received a more po|&s;itive Expre&s;s from King <HI>Henry,</HI> commanding him to appear forthwith at his Court, and to accept of the Propo&s;als of Peace, before the joynt Forces of <HI>En|gland</HI> and <HI>Wales</HI> were &s;ent to fetch him up. Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> having received &s;uch a threatning Me&s;&s;age, thought it now high time to repent of what he had afore &s;o ra&s;hly re&s;olved upon, and therefore after long Con&s;ultation, he judged it his wi&s;e&s;t way to accept of the King's Propo&s;als and to appear at Court. There it was agreed upon, that <HI>Rhys,</HI> who&s;e Lands heretofore lay &s;cattered about, and were intermixed with other Per|&s;on's E&s;tate, &s;hould enjoy <HI>Cantref Mawr,</HI> and any o|ther Cantref which the King &s;hould be plea&s;ed to be|&s;tow upon him. But contrary to this Article, the King a&s;&s;igned him &s;everal Lord&s;hips and other Lands far remote from each other, and particularly inter|mixed them with the E&s;tates of <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> whom he was &s;ure would be a watch and a curb to all the motions of Prince <HI>Rhys.</HI> This was indeed a very po|litick Contrivance or King <HI>Henry</HI> to keep under the high and re&s;tle&s;s Spirit of <HI>Rhys;</HI> but the Ju&s;tice of the Action does not &s;o evidently appear in breaking one of the chiefe&s;t Articles of the Peace, and chopping and be&s;towing that which was not ju&s;tly in his Power to give. But 'tis manife&s;tly apparent that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of the&s;e times were mainly concerned right

But in a &s;hort time, he had op|portunity either to demand redre&s;s from the King, or el&s;e to endeavour it him&s;elf by Force of Arms. For as &s;oon as <HI>Roger</HI> Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> was informed of the di&s;tribution which the King of <HI>England</HI> had grant|ed to Prince <HI>Rhys,</HI> he came to King <HI>Henry,</HI> reque&s;t|ing of his Maje&s;ty, that he would grant him &s;uch Lands in <HI>Wales,</HI> as he could win by force of Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> The King readily complied with his Reque&s;t, being always very forward to grant any thing which &s;eem|ed to curb and di&s;commode the <HI>Welch,</HI> and there|fore the Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> marched with a great Army into <HI>Cardigan,</HI> and having fortified the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Y&s;trat-Meyric, Humphrey, Dyfi, Dynerth</HI> and <HI>Lhanrhy|&s;tyd,</HI> he made &s;everal Incur&s;ions into the Country.

<P>Prince <HI>Rhys</HI> as he was unable to bear the&s;e out|rages, &s;o he was re&s;olved either to have immediate redre&s;s, or el&s;e to proclaim open War again&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and therefore he &s;ent an Expre&s;s to King <HI>Henry,</HI> complaining of the Ho&s;tilities which his Subjects the Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> and <HI>Walter Clifford</HI> had committed in in his Country.

The &s;ame Year <HI>Gwenwynwyn</HI> came to <HI>Shrews|bury</HI> to &s;peak with the King's Council, where he was detained Pri&s;oner: Whereupon Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> con|quered all his Country, took all his Towns and Ca|&s;tles, and garri&s;on'd them for his own u&s;e. This Ex|pedition of Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> mightily alarm'd the u&s;urping <HI>Maelgon,</HI> and the more, becau&s;e he had in|telligence that <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was on his march towards <HI>South-Wales;</HI> therefore he now puts him&s;elf in the be&s;t po&s;ture he could to receive him; but finding

But King <HI>John</HI> marched his Army along the Sea-Coa&s;t to <HI>Ruthlan,</HI> and there pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Clwyd,</HI> he came to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Teganwy,</HI> where he encamped for &s;ome time to refre&s;h and recreate his Army, which by rea&s;on of the long Marches they made, was in a great mea&s;ure weary and fatigued. But what the more augmented their mi&s;ery, <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> getting behind them, cut off all their hopes of Pro|vi&s;ion from <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Welch</HI> by the Advantage of being acquainted with the &s;traits and narrow Pa&s;|&s;ages, cut off all that &s;traggled from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Camp, &s;o that in time, they were glad to take up with Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, and any thing were it never &s;o mean, which might till up their greedy and empty Stomachs. At la&s;t King <HI>John</HI> finding no other Remedy, and perceiving it impo&s;&s;ible to continue longer there &s;o hungry and fainty, thought it his wi&s;e&s;t way to march for <HI>England</HI> and leave the <HI>Welch</HI> to them&s;elves, and &s;o he decamped in a great fury, leaving <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> to bury that great number of Dead, which had &s;tarved in this &s;ucces&s;le&s;s Expedition.

<P>Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> having to this purpo&s;e replyed in general to the Archbi&s;hops Articles, pre&s;ented him with a Copy of the &s;everal Grievances, which him|&s;elf and others of his Subjects had wrongfully and unju&s;tly received at the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And the&s;e, though &s;omewhat tedious, are thought nece&s;|&s;ary to be particularly in&s;erted in the Appendix, by rea&s;on that they demon&s;trably vindicate the <HI>Welch</HI> Nation, from the unrea&s;onable A&s;per&s;ions which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of the&s;e times ca&s;t upon it. For, the breach of Peace, and the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e di&s;mal Di&s;turban|ces in the Kingdom, are, by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Writers of tho&s;e times, wholly attributed to the re&s;tle&s;s and rebellious Humour and uncon&s;tant Temper of the <HI>Welch&punc;</HI> Whereas, had they looked at home, they might have found the Original of all the&s;e Troubles, to have proceeded from the intolerable Extortions and in&s;upportable Oppre&s;&s;ions of their own Nation.

But it is highly probable,

To the&s;e the Archbi&s;hop added his Threats; That in ca&s;e they did not com|ply, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the King's Mercy, there were very &s;evere and imminent Dangers hang|ing over their Heads; a formidable Army was ready to make an inroad into their Country, which would not only gaul and oppre&s;s them, but in all proba|bility totally eradicate the whole Nation: Be&s;ides which, they were to expect the &s;evere&s;t Cen&s;ure and Puni&s;hment of the Church.</P>
<P>But all this could not force &s;o unlimited a Sub|mi&s;&s;ion from the Prince, but that he would &s;tick up|on &s;ome certain Conditions; and therefore by Let|ter he acquainted the Archbi&s;hop, <Q REND="margQuotes">That he was with all willingne&s;s de&s;irous to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to the King; but withal, that he could not do it but in &s;uch a manner as was &s;afe and hone&s;t for him. And becau&s;e the Form of Submi&s;&s;ion contained in the Articles &s;ent to him, were by him&s;elf and his Council thought pernicious and illegal for him to con&s;ent to as tending rather to the De&s;truction, than the Security of him&s;elf and his Subjects, he could in no wi&s;e agree to it; and in ca&s;e him&s;elf &s;hould be willing, the re&s;t of his Nobility and People would never admit of it, as knowing for certain the Mi&s;|chief and Inconveniency that would en&s;ue thereby. Therefore he de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip, that for a Con|firmation of an hone&s;t and a durable Peace, which he had all this while earne&s;tly laboured for, he would manage Matters circum&s;pectly, and with due regard to the following Articles.

<P>Now &s;eeing neither the Prince nor any of his Sub|jects upon any account what&s;oever, have moved and begun this War, but only defended them&s;elves, their Properties, Laws, and Liberties, from the Encroach|ments of other Per&s;ons; and &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> for either Malice or Covetou&s;ne&s;s to obtain our E&s;tates, have unju&s;tly occa&s;ioned all the&s;e Troubles and Broils in the Kingdom, we are a&s;&s;ured that our Defence is ju&s;t and lawful, and therein depend upon the Aid and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven; which will be mo&s;t cruel|ly revenged upon our &s;acrilegious and inhumane Ene|mies, who have left no manner of Enormities, in relation to God and Man, uncommitted. Therefore your Grace would more ju&s;tly threaten your Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures, again&s;t the Authors and Abettors of &s;uch unparallell'd Villanies, than the innocent Suf|ferers. And be&s;ides, we much admire, that you &s;hould advi&s;e us to part with our own E&s;tates, and to live among our Enemies; as if, when we cannot peaceably enjoy what is our own unque&s;tionable Right, we might expect to have quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another Mans: And though, as you &s;ay, it be hard to live in War and perpetual Danger; yet much harder it is, to be utterly de&s;troyed and reduced to nothing; e&s;pecially, when we &s;eek but the Defence of our own Liberties from the in&s;atiable Ambition of our Enemies.

But this eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ure was only a Prologue to a more melancholy Scene; King <HI>Edward</HI> immediately upon it, &s;ending an Army by Sea to <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> with|out any great Oppo&s;ition, conquered the I&s;land, and without any Mercy, put all that with&s;tood him to the Sword. From thence de&s;igning to pa&s;s over to the Continent, he cau&s;ed a Bridg of Boats covered with Planks to be built over the <HI>Menay</HI> (being an Arm of the Sea which parteth the I&s;le from the main Land) at a place called <HI>Moel y don,</HI> not far from <HI>Bangor,</HI> where the Water is narrowe&s;t.

<P>And while the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>North-Wales,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> and Sir <HI>Edmund Mortimer</HI> acted vi|gorou&s;ly with their Forces in <HI>South-Wales;</HI> and fight|ing the <HI>Welch</HI> at <HI>Lhandeilo Fawr,</HI> overthrew them, with the lo&s;s of no con&s;iderable Per&s;on, &s;aving <HI>Wil|liam de Valence</HI> the King's Co&s;in-German, and Four Knights be&s;ides. Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> was all this while in <HI>Cardigan,</HI> a wa&s;ting and de&s;troying all the Coun|try, and principally the Lands of <HI>Rhys ap Meredith,</HI> who very unnaturally held with the King of <HI>England</HI> in all the&s;e Wars. But being at length tired with Action, with a few Men privately &s;eparated him&s;elf from his Army, and came to <HI>Buelht,</HI> thinking to ea&s;e and re&s;pit him&s;elf there undi&s;covered. But coming to the River <HI>Wye,</HI> he met with <HI>Edmund Mortimer</HI> and <HI>John Gifford,</HI> with a con&s;iderable Party of the People of that Country, which <HI>Mortimer</HI> was Lord of. But neither Party venturing to a&s;&s;ail the other, Prince <HI>Lhewelyn</HI> with one only Servant retired to a private Grove in a neighbouring Valley, there to con&s;ult with certain Lords of the Country, who had appointed to meet him. In the mean time <HI>Mortimer</HI> de&s;cends from the Hill, with intention to fall upon <HI>Lhewelyn</HI>'s Men; which they perceiving, betook them&s;elves to the Bridg called <HI>Pont Orewyn,</HI> and manfully defended the Pa&s;|&s;age he was to cro&s;s. <HI>Mortimer</HI> could effect nothing again&s;t them, till he had gained the Bridg, the River being unpa&s;&s;able; and to force them to quit it, &s;eem|ed altogether impracticable. But at la&s;t, the River was di&s;covered to be fordable a little below, and &s;o <HI>Helias Walwyn</HI> was detached with a Party through the River, who unexpectedly falling upon the backs of the Defendants, ea&s;ily forced them to leave the
<PB N="299" REF="186"> Bridg, and &s;ave them&s;elves by flight. Prince <HI>Lhe|welyn</HI> all this while in vain expected the Lords of <HI>Buelht,</HI> and in fine continued to wait &s;o long, till <HI>Mortimer</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed over the Bridg, &s;urrounded the Wood he was in with armed Men. The Prince perceiving him&s;elf to be betrayed, thought to make his e&s;cape to his Men; but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o clo&s;ely pur|&s;ued him, that before he could come in, one <HI>Adam Francton,</HI> not knowing who he was, run him through with his Sword, being unarmed. The <HI>Welch</HI> &s;till ex|pected the arrival of their Prince, and though but a few in number, &s;o gallantly maintained their ground, that in &s;pight of the far greater number of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they were at length with much ado put to flight. The Battel being over, <HI>Francton</HI> returned to plunder his dead; but perceiving him to be the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> he thought him&s;elf to have obtained a &s;uffi|cient Prize, and thereupon pre&s;ently chopt off his Head, and &s;ent it to King <HI>Edward</HI> at <HI>Conwey,</HI> who very joyfully cau&s;ed it to be placed upon the highe&s;t Pinacle of the Tower of <HI>London.</HI> And thus fell this worthy Prince, the greate&s;t, though the la&s;t of the <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Blood, betrayed mo&s;t ba&s;ely by the Lords of <HI>Buelht,</HI> and being dead, mo&s;t unworthily dealt with by the King of <HI>England;</HI> who contrary to all Pre&s;i|dents, treated a lawful Prince like a Traytor, and ex|po&s;ed his crowned Head to the Deri&s;ion of the Mul|titude.</P>
<P>Not long after, <HI>David</HI> the Prince's Brother was delivered up by the <HI>Welch</HI> them&s;elves, and in a Par|liament for that purpo&s;e a&s;&s;embled at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> was condemned to dye; his Head to be &s;ent to accompa|ny his Brothers upon the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and his four Quarters to the four Cities of <HI>Bri&s;tol, North|hampton, York,</HI> and <HI>Winche&s;ter.</HI> Then the King for the ea&s;ier keeping the <HI>Welch</HI> in due &s;ubjection, built Two &s;trong Ca&s;tles in <HI>North Wales;</HI> the one at <HI>Con|wey</HI> and the other at <HI>Caernarvon&punc;</HI> There was none that now &s;tood out be&s;ides <HI>Rhys Fychan</HI> of <HI>Y&s;tratywy;</HI> and he, finding <HI>David</HI> was gone, and him&s;elf like to do nothing to purpo&s;e, fairly yielded him&s;elf up to

He was a Prince of incomparable Qualifica|tions, but &s;o &s;ignally Famous in Martial Affairs, that upon the account of the &s;everal Actions he was en|gaged in, he received the Name of <HI>Black-Prince.</HI> He took <HI>John</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King Pri&s;oner at the Battel of <HI>Poictiers,</HI> and &s;hamefully vanqui&s;hed the <HI>French</HI> Army in the Battel of <HI>Cre&s;&s;y.</HI> He did not live to en|joy the Crown, but died one year before his Father, in the Forty Sixth Year of his Age; no Prince was in his life-time better beloved, and after his Death more lamented by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, who had he lived to &s;it upon the Helm, no one doubted but that he would have exceeded as to all Qualifications, the mo&s;t glorious Renown of the greate&s;t of his Ance|&s;tors.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, lived Sir <HI>Tudor Vaughan ap Grono,</HI> de&s;cended lineally from <HI>Ednyfed Vaughan,</HI> a Per&s;on as to E&s;tate, Power and Intere&s;t, one of the Chiefe&s;t in <HI>North Wales.</HI> Upon &s;ome motive, either of Ambition or Fancy, he a&s;&s;umed to him&s;elf the Honor of Knighthood, requiring all People to call and &s;tile him Sir <HI>Tudor ap Grono,</HI> as if he did progno&s;ticate and fore-&s;ee, that out of his Loyns &s;hould ari&s;e tho&s;e that &s;hould have Power to confer that Honor. King <HI>Edward</HI> being informed of &s;uch unparallell'd Pre&s;umption, &s;ent for Sir <HI>Tudor,</HI> and asked him, <HI>With what Confidence he dur&s;t invade his Prerogative, by a&s;&s;uming the degree of Knighthood, without his Authority.</HI> Sir <HI>Tudor</HI> replied, <HI>That by the Laws and Con&s;titution of King</HI> Arthur, <HI>he had the Li|berty of taking upon him&s;elf that Title, in regard he had tho&s;e three Qualifications, which who&s;oever was endued with, could by tho&s;e Laws claim the Honor of a Knight.</HI> 1. <HI>He was a Gentleman.</HI> 2. <HI>He had a &s;ufficient E&s;tate.</HI> And 3. <HI>He was Valiant and Ad|venturous;</HI> adding this withal, <HI>If my Valour and Har|dine&s;s be doubted of, loe here I throw down my Glove, and for due proof of my Courage, I am ready to Fight with any Man, whatever he be.</HI> The King apppro|ving and liking well the Man's forwardne&s;s and re&s;o|lution, was ea&s;ily per&s;uaded to confirm the Honor of

<P>After the Death of the <HI>Black Prince,</HI> his Son <HI>Richard</HI> born at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> being but Ten Years of age, was created Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> at <HI>Havering</HI> at <HI>Bowre,</HI> on the 20th. day of <HI>November,</HI> and in the <MILESTONE N="1377" UNIT="A.D."> 50th.

<P>Whil&s;t <HI>Richard</HI> the Second reigned, one <HI>Owen ap Gruffydh Fychan,</HI> de&s;cended of a younger Son of <HI>Gruffydh ap Madoc</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield,</HI> was not a lit|tle Famous. This <HI>Owen</HI> had his Education in one of the <HI>Inns-of-Court,</HI> where he became <HI>Bari&s;ter</HI> at Law, and afterwards in very great Favour and Credit &s;erved King <HI>Richard,</HI> and continued with him at <HI>Flint</HI> Ca&s;tle, till at length the King was taken by <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI> Betwixt this <HI>Owen</HI> and <HI>Reginald</HI> Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Rhuthyn,</HI> there happened no &s;mall Dif|ference touching a Common lying between the Lord|&s;hip of <HI>Rhuthyn,</HI> whereof <HI>Reginald</HI> was Owner, and the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Glyndowrdwy</HI> in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Owen,</HI> whence he borrowed the Name of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> Du|ring the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, <HI>Owen</HI> as being a Courtier, and in no mean e&s;teem with the King, did over-power <HI>Reginald,</HI> who was neither &s;o well be|friended at Court, nor beloved in the Country as <HI>Owen</HI> was. But after King <HI>Richard</HI>'s depo&s;al, the Scene was altered, and <HI>Reginald</HI> as then better be|friended than <HI>Owen,</HI> entred upon the Common&punc; which occa&s;ioned <HI>Owen</HI> in the fir&s;t Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth to make his Complaint in Parliament again&s;t him,
<PB N="316" REF="195"> for thus dive&s;ting him of his Right.

Glyndwr</HI> therefore perceiving how his Petition was &s;lighted in Parliament, and finding no other method to redre&s;s him&s;elf, having &s;everal Friends and Fol|lowers, put him&s;elf in Arms again&s;t <HI>Reginald,</HI> and meeting him in the Field, overcame and took him pri|&s;oner, and &s;poiled his Lord&s;hip of <HI>Rhuthyn.</HI> Upon this many re&s;orted to him from all parts of <HI>Wales,</HI> &s;ome thinking him to be in as great Favour now, as in King <HI>Richard</HI>'s days, others putting in his head, that now the time was come when the <HI>Britains</HI> by his means might again recover the Honor and Liber|ties of their Ance&s;tors. But <HI>Reginald</HI> being thus kept pri&s;oner, and very &s;everely handled by <HI>Owen,</HI> to ter|rify him into compliance with him in his rebellious Actings, and not permitted to have his Liberty, un|der Ten Thou&s;and Marks for his Ran&s;om, whereof Six Thou&s;and to be paid upon the Fea&s;t of St. <HI>Martyn,</HI> in the 4th. Year of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, and to deliver up his elde&s;t Son with &s;ome other Per&s;ons of Qua|lity as Ho&s;tages for the remainder; the King at the humble &s;ute of <HI>Reginald,</HI> &s;eeing no other way for his enlargement, gave way thereto, authorizing Sir <HI>Wil|liam de Roos,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard de Grey,</HI> Sir <HI>William de Wil|lughby,</HI> Sir <HI>William le Zouche,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh Huls,</HI> as al&s;o, <HI>John Harvey, William Vaus, John Lee, John Langford, Thomas Payne,</HI> and <HI>John Elne&s;tow,</HI> to treat with <HI>Owen</HI> and his Council, and to conclude in what they &s;hould conceive mo&s;t expedient and nece&s;&s;ary to be done for his redemption. Whereupon they con&s;enting to give the &s;um demanded by <HI>Glyndwr</HI> for his deliverance, the King gave Licen&s;e to <HI>Robert Braybroke</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> as al&s;o to Sir <HI>Gerard Braybroke</HI> the Father, and Sir <HI>Gerard</HI> the Son, then Feoffees of divers Lord&s;hips for this <HI>Reginald,</HI> to &s;ell the Mannor of <HI>Hertelegh</HI> in the County of <HI>Kent,</HI> towards the rai&s;ing of that
<PB N="317" REF="195"> Money. And for the better enabling him to pay &s;o great a Fine, the King was plea&s;ed to grant, that whereas it was enacted, that &s;uch Per&s;ons who were owners of Lands in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and did not there re&s;ide, &s;hould for &s;uch their neglect, forfeit two parts of the Profits of them to the King; that notwith&s;tanding this Act, he &s;hould forfeit nothing for non-re&s;idence there, during the term of &s;ix years next en&s;uing.</P>
<P>This good Succe&s;s over the Lord <HI>Gray,</HI> together with the numerous re&s;ort of the <HI>Welch</HI> to him, and the favourable interpretations of the Prophecies of <HI>Merdhyn,</HI> which &s;ome con&s;trued very advantagi|ou&s;&s;y, made the &s;welling mind of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> over|flow its Banks, and gave him &s;ome hopes of re&s;toring this I&s;land back to the <HI>Britains.</HI> Wherefore he &s;et upon the Earl of <HI>March,</HI> who met him with a nu|merous party of <HI>Hereford-&s;hire</HI> Men, but when they came to clo&s;e, the <HI>Welch</HI>-men proved too powerful, and having killed above a Thou&s;and Men of the <HI>En|gli&s;h,</HI> they took the Earl of <HI>March</HI> Pri&s;oner. King <HI>Henry</HI> upon this was frequently reque&s;ted to Ran&s;om the Earl, but to no purpo&s;e; for whether by rea&s;on that <HI>Mortimer</HI> had a ju&s;ter Title to the Crown than him&s;elf, he being the next Heir in Blood after King <HI>Richard,</HI> who was as yet living, or becau&s;e of &s;ome other private <HI>odium,</HI> the King would never hearken to his Redemp|tion, alledging that he wilfully threw him&s;elf into the hands of <HI>Glyndwr.</HI> But about the mid&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> to correct the pre&s;umptuous Attempts of the <HI>Welch,</HI> the King went in Per&s;on with a great Army into <HI>Wales;</HI> but by rea&s;on of extraordinary exce&s;s of wea|ther, which &s;ome attributed to the Magic of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> he was glad to return &s;afe.</P>
<P>But the Earl of <HI>March</HI> perceiving that he was not like to obtain his Liberty by King <HI>Henry</HI>'s means, whether out of compliance, by rea&s;on of his tedious Captivity, or Affection to the young Lady, he agreed to take part with <HI>Owen</HI> again&s;t the King of <HI>England,</HI> and to marry his Daughter; with them joyned the Earl of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and his Brother the Earl of <HI>Nor|thumberland,</HI> with his Son the valiant Lord <HI>Percy,</HI> who
<PB N="318" REF="196"> con&s;piring to depo&s;e the King of <HI>England,</HI> in the Hou&s;e of the Archdeacon of <HI>Bangor,</HI> by their Deputies di|vided the Realm among&s;t them, cau&s;ing a tripartite Indenture to be made, and to be &s;ealed with every one's Seal; by which Covenant all that Country ly|ing betwixt the <HI>Severn</HI> and the <HI>Trent, Southward,</HI> was a&s;&s;igned to the Earl of <HI>March;</HI> all <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Lands beyond the <HI>Severn, We&s;tward,</HI> were appointed <HI>Glyndwr;</HI> and all from the <HI>Trent, Northward,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Percy.</HI> This was done (as &s;ome &s;aid) thro' a fooli&s;h Credit they gave to a vain Prophecy, as tho' King <HI>Henry</HI> was the execrable Moldwarp, and they three the Dragon, the Lion, and the Wolf which &s;hould pull him down, and di&s;tribute his Kingdom among them&s;elves. After that they exhibited Articles of their Grievances to King <HI>Henry,</HI> and divulged their Rea|&s;ons for taking up Arms; at length they marched with all their Power towards <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> to fight the King, depending mainly upon the arrival of <HI>Glyndwr</HI> and his <HI>Welch-men.</HI> But the matter was gone &s;o far, that whether he came in or no, they mu&s;t fight, and &s;o both Armies being joyned, the King's Party prevailed, young <HI>Percy</HI> being &s;lain upon the &s;pot, and <HI>Douglas,</HI> be&s;ides mo&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of Quality, who with a Party of <HI>Scotch</HI> had come to the Aid of the Confederates, was taken Pri&s;oner, but afterwards honourably &s;et at Liberty by the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> In the mean time the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was a marching forward with a great Party from the <HI>North,</HI> but the King having &s;ettled Matters about <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> coming to <HI>York,</HI> and &s;ending to him to lay down his Arms, he vo|luntarily &s;ubmitted and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his Forces. Then the King returning from <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> determined to pa&s;s over to <HI>North-Wales,</HI> to cha&s;ti&s;e the pre&s;ump|tuous Practices of the immorigerous <HI>Welch,</HI> who after his departure from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> had made in-Roads into the Marches, and done much hurt to his <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects. But other Bu&s;ine&s;s of greater Con&s;equence intervening, he detached his Son the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who took the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Abery&s;twyth,</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="196"> which was quickly again retaken by <HI>Owen Glyndwr,</HI> who thru&s;t into it a &s;trong Garri&s;on of <HI>Welch.</HI> But <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">n the Battel of <HI>Huske</HI> &s;ought upon the fifteenth of <HI>March,</HI> the <HI>Welch</HI> received a very con&s;iderable Blow from the Prince's Men, <HI>Glyndwr</HI>'s Son being taken Pri&s;oner, be&s;ides Fifteen Hundred more taken and &s;lain. After this, we hear little of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> ex|cepting that he continued and per&s;i&s;ted to vex and plague the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> upon the Marches, to the tenth year of King <HI>Henry</HI>'s reign, when he mi&s;erably ended his life; being as <HI>Holing&s;hed</HI> reporteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Holin&s;.</NOTE> towards his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">atter days driven to that extremity, that de&s;pairing of all comfort, he fled and lurked in Caves and other the mo&s;t &s;olitary places, fearing to &s;hew his face to any Creature, till at length being &s;tarved for hun|ger and lack of &s;u&s;tenance, he mi&s;erably ended his life.</P>
<P>But the&s;e rebellious Practices of <HI>Glyndwr,</HI> highly exa&s;perated King <HI>Henry</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Welch,</HI> in&s;omuch that &s;everal rigorous and unmerciful Laws were enacted, relating to <HI>Wales,</HI> which in effect de&s;troyed all the Liberties of the <HI>Welch</HI> Subject. They were made incapable of purcha&s;ing any Lands, or to be elected Members of any County or Burrough, and to undertake any Office, whether Civil or Military in any Town incorporated. If any Suit at Law happened betwixt an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man and a <HI>Welch</HI> Man, the former could not be convicted, but by the Sentence of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Judge, and the Ver|dict of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Jury; be&s;ides, that any <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Man who married a <HI>Welch</HI> Woman, was thereby forthwith di&s;franchi&s;ed from all the Liber|ties of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subject. It was farther enact|ed, that no <HI>Welch</HI> Man &s;hould be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any Ca&s;tle, or other place of Strength, and that no Victuals or Armour &s;hould be brought into <HI>Wales,</HI> without a &s;pecial Warrant from the King or his Council; and farther, that no <HI>Welch</HI> Man was capable of undertaking the Office of Ju&s;tice, Chamberlain, Sheriff or any other place of Tru&s;t in any part of <HI>Wales,</HI> notwith&s;tanding any Patent
<PB N="320" REF="197"> or Licen&s;e heretofore given to the contrary. The&s;e, with many others mo&s;t rigorous and unju&s;t Laws, particularly that forbidding any <HI>Welch</HI> Man to bring up his Children to Learning, or to bind them Ap|prentices to any Trade or Occupation, were enacted by the King again&s;t the <HI>Welch;</HI> &s;o that nothing could cool his di&s;plea&s;ure, but that a whole Nation &s;hould be wrongfully oppre&s;&s;ed, for the fault and mi&s;carriage of one Per&s;on. But one might think, that this was no politick method to &s;ecure a Nation in its Allegiance, which upon lighter Affronts was u&s;ed to defend its Priviledges; and therefore we may well attribute the quiet di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Welch</HI> towards this time, to the moderation of <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth, who within a little time &s;ucceeded his Father in the Crown of <HI>England.</HI></P>

But being informed that his Ma&s;ter <HI>Richard</HI> was depo&s;ed and murdered, and withal being pro|voked by &s;everal Wrongs and Affronts done him by his Neighbour the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> of <HI>Rhuthyn,</HI> whom King <HI>Henry</HI> greatly countenanced, and look|ing upon <HI>Henry</HI> as an U&s;urper, he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be proclaimed Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> And for a better grace of the matter, he feigned him&s;elf to be de&s;cended by a Daughter from <HI>Lhewelyn ap Gruffydh</HI> the la&s;t Prince; whereas in truth, he came Pater|nally but from a younger Brother of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Powys.</HI> But as Ambition has no moderation, &s;o <HI>Glyndwr</HI> for a time acted the part of a Prince, and &s;ummoned a Parliament to meet at <HI>Machynlleth,</HI> whither the Nobility and Gentry of <HI>Wales</HI> ap|peared,

And to that end, he meant to e&s;tabli&s;h a Court within the &s;aid Principality, and con&s;tituted <HI>John</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Prince's Council in the <HI>Marches;</HI> who, together with <HI>Anthony</HI> Earl of <HI>Rivers,</HI> &s;at in the Town-Hall of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and con&s;tituted certain Ordinances for
<PB N="324" REF="199"> the publick Good and Tranquility of that place. But the matter proceeded no farther; for the Trou|bles and Di&s;quietne&s;s of his Kingdom, coming heavy upon him, and the &s;hortne&s;s of his Reign after his E&s;tabli&s;hment not permitting, he was forced to leave that to others, which him&s;elf thought once to bring about.</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> born at <HI>Middleham</HI> near <HI>Richmond</HI> in the County of <HI>York</HI> the only Son of King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, was at Ten Years of Age created by his Fa|ther Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and dyed &s;oon after.</P>
<P><HI>Arthur,</HI> the elde&s;t Son of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, born at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> was in the Seventh Year of his Fathers Reign created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI> About the Fifteenth Year of his Age, being then newly married to <HI>Katherine</HI> the Infanta of <HI>Spain,</HI> he was &s;ent by his Father into <HI>Wales,</HI> that by his pre&s;ence he might keep that Country in better awe. With him King <HI>Henry</HI> &s;ent Dr. <HI>William Smith,</HI> afterwards made Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wokins</HI> p. 789.</NOTE> as Pre&s;ident of his Council; toge|ther with Sir <HI>Richard Pool,</HI> his Chamberlain, Sir <HI>Hen|ry Vernon,</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Crofts,</HI> Sir <HI>David Philip,</HI> Sir <HI>William &V;dal,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Englefield,</HI> Sir <HI>Peter New|ton,</HI> and others, to be his Coun&s;ellors and Directors in his management of Affairs. But the Prince had not continu'd long there, but he fell &s;ick at his Ca|&s;tle at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> of which Indi&s;po&s;ition he &s;hortly af|ter dyed, and was buried with great Solemnity in the Cathedral Church of <HI>Worce&s;ter.</HI> But the creating of his Brother <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> in his &s;tead, was deferred for about the &s;pace of a Month, to di&s;cover whether the Lady <HI>Katherine</HI> was got with Child by Prince <HI>Arthur.</HI> But when it appeared for certain, &s;he had not conceived; on the 18th day of <HI>February,</HI> in the Nineteenth Year of his Father, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh's Reign, <HI>Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>York</HI> was created Prince of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, being by his Grandfather <HI>Owen Tudor</HI> de&s;cended out of <HI>Wales,</HI> and having &s;uf|ficiently experienced the Affection of the <HI>Welch</HI> to|wards him; fir&s;t, of tho&s;e, who upon his fir&s;t land|ing,
<PB N="325" REF="199"> opportunely joyned him under Sir <HI>Rhys ap Thomas;</HI> and then of tho&s;e, who under the command of Sir <HI>William Stanley,</HI> Lord of <HI>Bromfield, Yale,</HI> and <HI>Chirk|land,</HI> aided him in <HI>Bo&s;worth</HI>-Field; could not in Ho|nour and Equity, but bear &s;ome regard to the mi&s;e|rable &s;tate and condition of the <HI>Welch,</HI> under the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government. And therefore this prudent Prince, finding the Calamities of the <HI>Welch</HI> to be in|&s;upportable, and &s;eeing what grievous and unmerciful Laws were enacted again&s;t them by his Predece&s;&s;ours, he took occa&s;ion to redre&s;s and reform the &s;ame, and granted to the <HI>Welch</HI> a Charter of Liberty and Im|munity, whereby they were relea&s;ed from the cruel Oppre&s;&s;ion, which &s;ince their Subjection to the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Government, they had mo&s;t cruelly &s;u&s;tained. And &s;eeing the Birth and Quality of his Grandfather <HI>Owen Tudor</HI> was called in que&s;tion, and that he was by many upbraided of being of a mean and ignoble Parentage; King <HI>Henry</HI> directed a Commi&s;&s;ion to the Abbot of <HI>Lhan Egwe&s;t,</HI> Dr. <HI>Owen Pool</HI> Canon of <HI>He|reford,</HI> and <HI>John King</HI> Herald at Arms, to make in|qui&s;ition concerning the Pedigree of the &s;aid <HI>Owen;</HI> who coming to <HI>Wales,</HI> made a diligent enquiry into this matter; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Sir <HI>John Leyaf, Guttyn Owen Bardh, Gruffydh ap Lhewelyn ap Efan Fychan,</HI> and others, in the con&s;ultation of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Books of Pedegrees, they drew up an exact Genealo|gy of <HI>Owen Tudor,</HI> which upon their return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide Ap|p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">nd.</NOTE> they pre|&s;ented to the King.</P>
<P><HI>Edward,</HI> Son to <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, by the Lady <HI>Jane Seymour,</HI> his third Wife, was born at <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> on the 12th of <HI>October;</HI> and upon the 18th. of the &s;aid Month, was created Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> Duke of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, had already abrogated tho&s;e unrea&s;onable and intollerable Laws, which the former Kings of <HI>England,</HI> particularly <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth, had made again&s;t the <HI>Welch;</HI> and now, King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, willing to make a plenary Reformation of what his Father had wi&s;ely begun, thought it nece&s;&s;ary towards the Good and Tranqui|lity
<PB N="326" REF="200"> of both Nations, to make the <HI>Welch</HI> &s;ubject to the &s;ame Laws, and the &s;ame Government with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He under&s;tood that the u&s;ual Ho&s;tilities and Depredations were &s;till continued and kept up by both &s;ides upon the Borders; and though his Fa|ther had ea&s;ed the Yoak of the <HI>Welch,</HI> yet he per|ceived, that it did contribute but little towards the di&s;annulling of that inveterate and implacable Envy and Animo&s;ity which raged in the Marches. There|fore to remedy this, otherwi&s;e unavoidable, Di&s;tem|per, he concluded that it was the only effectual Me|thod, to incorporate the <HI>Welch</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> that they being &s;ubject to the &s;ame Laws, might e|qually <MILESTONE N="1536" UNIT="A.D."> fear the Violation of them. And according|ly, in the Twenty Seventh Year of his Reign, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed to that purpo&s;e, which to|gether with another Act in the Thirty Fifth of his Reign, made a plenary Incorporation of the <HI>Welch</HI> with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which Union has had that ble&s;&s;ed Effect, that it has di&s;pelled all tho&s;e unnatural Diffe|rences which heretofore were &s;o rife and irreconcilable.</P>
<P>When the Reformation was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Wales,</HI> it was a mighty Inconveniency to the vulgar People, &s;uch as were unacquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, that the Bible was not tran&s;lated into their native Language. Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was quickly ap|prehen&s;ive of the Inconveniency which the <HI>Welch</HI> in|curred, for the want of &s;uch a Tran&s;lation; and there|fore, <MILESTONE N="1566" UNIT="A.D."> in the Eighth Year of her Reign, an Act of Parliament was pa&s;&s;ed, whereby the Bi&s;hops of <HI>He|reford,</HI> S. <HI>Davids,</HI> S. <HI>A&s;aph, Bangor,</HI> and <HI>Landaff,</HI> were ordered to take care that the Bible containing the Old and New Te&s;tament, with the Book of Common-Prayer, and Admini&s;tration of the Sacra|ments, be truly and exactly tran&s;lated into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> or <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, and that the &s;ame &s;o tran&s;lated, being by them peru&s;ed and approved, be printed to &s;uch a number at lea&s;t; as that every Cathedral, Col|legiate and Pari&s;h-Church and Chappel of ea&s;e with|in the &s;aid Dioce&s;s where that Tongue is vulgarly &s;poken, might be &s;upplyed before the Fir&s;t of <HI>March,
<PB N="327" REF="200"> Anno</HI> 1566. And from that time forward, the <HI>Welch</HI> Divine Service &s;hould be u&s;ed in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Tongue, in all places throughout tho&s;e Dioce&s;&s;es, where the <HI>Welch</HI> is commonly &s;poke, after the &s;ame manner as it was u&s;ed in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue; and that the Charge of procuring the &s;aid Bible and Common-Prayer, &s;hould equally depend betwixt the Par&s;on and the Pari&s;h; the former being obliged to pay one half of the Expence; and that the Price of the Book &s;hould be &s;et by the fore&s;aid Bi&s;hops, or by Three of them at the lea&s;t. But this Act of Parliament was not punctually ob&s;erved; for the Old Te&s;tament was wholly omitted, and only the New, with the Book of Common-Prayer and Admini&s;tration of the Sacra|ments, then tran&s;lated, which Tran&s;lation was chief|ly owing to <HI>Richard</HI> Bi&s;hop of S. <HI>Davids,</HI> who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>William Salusbury,</HI> a Perfect Critick in the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, and one excellently conver&s;ant in all <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Antiquities. But in the Year 1588. Dr. <HI>Wil|liam Morgan,</HI> fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> and then of S. <HI>A&s;aph,</HI> undertook the Tran&s;lation of the whole Bi|ble; and by the help of the Bi&s;hops of S. <HI>A&s;aph</HI> and <HI>Bangor, Gabriel Goodman</HI> Dean of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, David Pow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> D.D. <HI>Edmund Price</HI> Archdeacon of <HI>Merionyth,</HI> and <HI>Richard Va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ghan,</HI> he effectually fini&s;hed it. This was of &s;ingular Profit and Advantage to the <HI>Welch,</HI> to have the whole Scripture read and peru&s;ed in their own native Tongue; by which means they received a clearer demon&s;tration of the Corruptions of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when they &s;aw many of their Prin|ciples apparently contradicting, and others not very firmly founded upon the Holy Scriptures. And on the other hand they perceived the Nece&s;&s;ity and Advan|tage of the Reformation, they ea&s;ily di&s;covered that the whole Doctrine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> was &s;ound and orthodox, and that they were now happi|ly delivered from that Popi&s;h Slavery which their Forefathers ignorantly adored; and therefore being convinced of the Truth of their Religion, they be|came, and continued generally, very &s;trict Adherents and firm Ob&s;ervers of the Doctrine and Di&s;cipline of this Church.</P>

<P>And here by the bye, I cannot but ob&s;erve what a reverend Writer has lately in&s;inuated, relating to the Chri&s;tian Religion planted in <HI>Wales.</HI> For that Learn|ed Per&s;on in his Funeral Sermon upon Mr. <HI>Gouge,</HI> would fain induce the World to believe, that Chri|&s;tianity was very corrupt and imperfect among the <HI>Welch,</HI> before it was purifyed by that, whom he terms Apo&s;tolical Man. Whereas it is notoriou&s;ly evident, that &s;ince the Reformation was &s;etled in that Country, and the Bible, with the Book of Com|mon-Prayer, tran&s;lated into the <HI>Welch</HI> Tongue, no place has been more exact, in keeping to the &s;trict Rubrick and Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> both as to the Sub&s;tance and Form of Wor&s;hip. But what may more truly be attributed to Mr. <HI>Gouge,</HI> is that &s;ince his Travels into <HI>Wales,</HI> and the propagating of his Doctrine among the ignorant of that Country, Presbytery, which before had &s;carce taken root, has daily increa&s;ed, and grown to a Head.</P>

For joy of this new Creation, the Town of <HI>Ludlow,</HI> and City of <HI>London,</HI> performed very great Triumphs; and the more to honour this Solemnity, the King made Twenty Five Knights of the Bath, all Lords or Barons Sons; and the Inns of Court, to expre&s;s their Joy, elected out of their Body Forty choice Gentlemen, to perform &s;olemn Ju&s;ts and Bar|ryers.</P>
