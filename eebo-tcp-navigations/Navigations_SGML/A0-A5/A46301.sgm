<P>At <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> I began my Journal, from whence we departed on the 26. of <HI>April,</HI> about Six of the clock at night, and went down into the <HI>Hope.</HI></P>

<P>The 28. we twined into the Downs, where Captain <HI>Clark</HI> one of His Maje&s;ties Captains in the Navy, came aboard of us in the afternoon, and pre&s;t two of our Trumpeters. Here we had good &s;tore of Flounders from the Fi&s;hermen, new taken out of the Sea and living, which being rea|dily gutted, were fry'd while they were warm; me thoughts I never ta&s;ted of a delicater Fi&s;h in all my life before.</P>
<P>The Third of <HI>May</HI> being <HI>A&s;cen&s;ion</HI> day, in the afternoon we weighed out of the <HI>Downs,</HI> the wind at <HI>E.</HI> and ran down into <HI>Dover</HI> Road, and lay by the lee, whil&s;t they &s;ent the Skiffe a&s;hore for one of the Ma&s;ters mates: by the way we pa&s;t <HI>Sandwich</HI> in the

<P>The Eighth day, one <HI>Boremans</HI> man a pa&s;&s;enger was duck'd at the main yards arm (for being drunk with his Ma&s;ters &s;trong waters which he &s;tole) thrice, and fire given to two whole Sacree, at that in&s;tant. Two mighty Whales we now &s;aw, the one &s;pouted water through two great holes in her head into the Air a great height, and making a great noi&s;e with pu&s;&s;ing and blowing, the Seamen called her a Soutler; the other was further off, about a league from the Ship, fighting with the Sword-fi&s;h, and the Flail|fi&s;h, who&s;e &s;troakes with a fin that growes upon her back like a flail, upon the back of the Whale, we heard with amazement: when pre&s;ently &s;ome more than half as far again we &s;pied a &s;pout from above, it came pouring down like a River of water; So that if they &s;hould light in any Ship, &s;he were in danger to be pre&s;ently &s;unk down into the Sea, and falleth with &s;uch an ex|tream violence all whole together as one drop, or as water out of a Ve&s;&s;el, and du|red a quarter of an hour, making the Sea to boyle like a pot, and if any Ve&s;&s;el be near, it &s;ucks it in. I &s;aw many of the&s;e &s;pouts afterwards at nearer di&s;tance. In the afternoon the Mariners &s;truck a Porpi&s;ce, called al&s;o a <HI>Mar&s;ovius</HI> or Sea-hogg, with an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> harping Iron, and hoi&s;ted her aboard,
<PB N="5" REF="6">they cut &s;ome of it into thin pieces, and fryed, it ta&s;ts like ru&s;ty Bacon, or hung Beef, if not wor&s;e; but the Liver boiled and &s;ou&s;ed &s;ometime in Vinegar is more grateful to the pallat. About 8 of the clock at night, a flame &s;ettled upon the main ma&s;t, it was about the bigne&s;s of a great Candle, and is called by our Seamen St. <HI>Elmes</HI> fire, it comes before a &s;torm, and is commonly thought to be a Spirit; if two appear they progno&s;ticate &s;afety: The&s;e are known to the learned by the names of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pol|lux,</HI> to the <HI>Italians</HI> by St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and St. <HI>Hermes,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called <HI>Corpos Santes.</HI></P>
<P>The Ninth day, about two of the clock in the afternoon, we found the head of our main ma&s;t clo&s;e to the cap twi&s;ted and &s;hive|red, and we pre&s;ently after found the fore|top-ma&s;t crackt a little above the cap; So they wolled them both, and about two of the clock in the morning 7 new long Boat oars brake away from our Star-board quar|ter with a horrid crack.</P>
<P>The Eleventh day, they ob&s;erved and made the Ship to be in latitude 48 degrees 46 minuts, having a great Sea all night; a|bout 6 of the clock in the morning we &s;pake with Mr. <HI>Rupe</HI> in a Ship of <HI>Dart|mouth,</HI> which came from <HI>Marcelloes;</HI> and now is <HI>Silly N.

<P>The Twelfth day being <HI>Whit&s;unday,</HI> at prayer-time we found the Ships trine a foot by the &s;tern, and al&s;o the partie that was &s;ick of the &s;mall pox now dyed, whom we buried in the Sea, tying a bullet (as the manner is) to his neck, and another to his leggs, turned him out at a Port-hole, giving fire to a great Gun. In the afternoon one <HI>Martin Jvy</HI> a &s;tripling, &s;ervant to Captain <HI>Thomas Cammock</HI> was whipt naked at the Cap-&s;tern, with a Cat with Nine tails, for filching 9 great Lemmons out of the <HI>Chirurgeons</HI> Cabbin, which he eat rinds and all in le&s;s than an hours time.</P>
<P>The Thirteenth day we took a Sharke, a great one, and hoi&s;ted him aboard with his two Companions (for there is never a Sharke, but hath a mate or two) that is the Pilot fi&s;h or Pilgrim, which lay upon his back clo&s;e to a long finn; the other fi&s;h (&s;ome what bigger than the Pilot) about two foot long, called a <HI>Remora,</HI> it hath no &s;cales and &s;ticks clo&s;e for the Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">kes belly.
<PB N="7" REF="7">So the Whale hath the Sea-gudgeon, a &s;mall fi&s;h for his mate, marching before him, and guiding him; which I have &s;een likewi&s;e. The Seamen divided the Sharke into quar|ters, and made more quarter about it than the Pur&s;er, when he makes five quarters of an Oxe, and after they had cooked him, he proved very rough Grain'd, not worthy of whole&s;ome preferment; but in the after|noon we took &s;tore of <HI>Bonitoes,</HI> or Spani&s;h <HI>Dolphins,</HI> a fi&s;h about the &s;ize of a large Mackarel, beautified with admirable varie|tie of glittering colours in the water, and was excellent food.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth day we &s;pake with a <HI>Plimouth</HI> man (about dinner time) bound for <HI>New-found-land,</HI> who having gone up we&s;t-ward &s;prang a leak, and now bore back for <HI>Plimouth.</HI> Now was <HI>Silly</HI> 50 leagues off, and now many of the pa&s;&s;engers fall &s;ick of the &s;mall Pox and Calenture.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth Mr. <HI>Clarke,</HI> who came out of the <HI>Downs</HI> with us, and was bound for the I&s;le of <HI>Providence,</HI> one of the &s;ummer I&s;lands; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having taken it a little before, though unknown to <HI>Clarke,</HI> and to Captain <HI>Nathaniel Butler</HI> going Go|vernour, they now departed from us the Wind <HI>N.

<P>The One and twentieth day, the wind <HI>S.</HI> by <HI>W.</HI> great Seas and Wind fu'd our cour&s;es, and tryed from 5 of the clock af|ternoon, till 4 in the morning, the night be|ing very &s;tormie and dark; we lo&s;t Mr. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">odlad</HI> and his Ship, who came out with us, and bound for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>The Eight and twentieth day, all this while a very great grown Sea and mighty winds.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the fir&s;t day in the afternoon, very thick foggie weather, we &s;ailed by an in|chanted I&s;land, &s;aw a great deal of filth and rubbi&s;h floating by the Ship, heard <HI>Cawdi|mawdies, Sea-gulls</HI> and <HI>Crowes,</HI> (Birds that alwayes frequent the &s;hoar) but could &s;ee nothing by rea&s;on of the mi&s;t: towards Sun|&s;et, when we were pa&s;t the I&s;land, it cleared up.</P>
<P>The Fourteenth day of <HI>June,</HI> very fog|gie weather, we &s;ailed by an I&s;land of Ice (which lay on the Star-board &s;ide) three leagues in length mountain high, in form of
<PB N="9" REF="8">land, with Bayes and Capes like high clift land, and a River pouring off it into the Sea. We &s;aw likewi&s;e two or three Foxes, or Devils skipping upon it. The&s;e I&s;lands of Ice are congealed in the North, and brought down in the &s;pring-time with the Current to the banks on this &s;ide <HI>New-found-land,</HI> and there &s;topt, where they di&s;&s;olve at la&s;t to water; by that time we had &s;ailed half way by it, we met with a <HI>French</HI> Pickeroon. Here it was as cold as in the middle of <HI>Ja|nuary</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o continued till we were &s;ome leagues beyond it.</P>
<P>The Sixteenth day we &s;ounded, and found 35 fathom water, upon the bank of <HI>New-found-land,</HI> we ca&s;t our our hooks for Cod-fi&s;h, thick foggie weather, the Codd being taken on a Sanday morning, the Se|ctaries aboard threw tho&s;e their &s;ervants took into the Sea again, although they wanted fre&s;h victuals, but the Sailers were not &s;o nice, among&s;t many that were taken, we had &s;ome that were wa&s;ted Fi&s;h, &amp; it is ob&s;ervable and very &s;trange, that fi&s;hes bo|dies do grow &s;lender with age, their Tails and Heads retaining their former bigne&s;s; Fi&s;h of all Creatures have generally the bigge&s;t heads, and the fir&s;t part that begins to taint in a fi&s;h is the head.</P>
<P>The Nineteenth day, Captain <HI>Thomas
<PB N="10" REF="9">Cammock</HI> (a near kin&s;man of the Earl of <HI>Warwicks</HI>) now had another lad <HI>Thomas Jones,</HI> that dyed of the &s;mall pox at eight of the clock at night.</P>
<P>The Twentieth day, we &s;aw a great number of Sea-bats, or Owles, called al&s;o flying fi&s;h, they are about the bigne&s;s of a Whiting, with &s;our tin&s;el wings, with which they fly as long as they are wet, when pur&s;ued by other fi&s;hes. Here like|wi&s;e we &s;aw many Grandpi&s;ces or Herring|hogs, hunting the &s;choles of Herrings, in the afternoon we &s;aw a great fi&s;h called the <HI>vehuella</HI> or Sword fi&s;h, having a long, &s;trong and &s;harp finn like a Sword-blade on the top of his head, with which he pierced our Ship, and broke it off with &s;triving to get loo&s;e, one of our Sailers dived and brought it aboard.</P>
<P>The One and twentieth day, we met with two <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> men bound for <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> and now we are 100 and 75 leagues off <HI>Cape-Sable,</HI> the &s;andy <HI>Cape,</HI> for &s;o <HI>Sable</HI> in French &s;ignifieth, off of which ly|eth the I&s;le of <HI>Sable,</HI> which is beyond <HI>New-found-land,</HI> where they take the <HI>Amphibious</HI> Creature, the <HI>Walrus, Mors,</HI> or <HI>Sea-Hor&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The Two and twentieth, another pa&s;&s;en|ger dyed of a Con&s;umption. Now we pa&s;&s;ed by the Southern part of <HI>New-found-land,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="9">within &s;ight of it; the Southern part of <HI>New-found-land</HI> is &s;aid to be not above 600 leagues from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Six and twentieth day, Capt. <HI>Thomas Cammock</HI> went aboard of a Barke of 300 Tuns, laden with I&s;land Wine, and but 7 men in her, and never a Gun, bound for <HI>Richmonds</HI> I&s;land, &s;et out by Mr. <HI>Trelaney</HI> of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> exceeding hot weather now.</P>
<P>The Eight and twentieth, one of Mr. <HI>Edward Ting's</HI> the undertakers men now dyed of the Phthi&s;ick.</P>
<P>The Nine and twentieth day, &s;ounded at night, and found 120 fathome water, the head of the Ship &s;truck again&s;t a rock; At 4 of the clock we de&s;cryed two &s;ail bound for <HI>New-found-land,</HI> and &s;o for the <HI>Streights,</HI> they told us of a general Earth-quake in <HI>New-England,</HI> of the Birth of a Mon&s;ter at <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> in the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets-Bay</HI> a mortality, and now we are two leagues off <HI>Cape Aun.</HI></P>
<P>The Thirtieth day proved &s;tormie, and having lo&s;t the &s;ight of Land, we &s;aw none untill the morning; doubtfully di&s;covering the Coa&s;t, fearing the Lee-&s;hore all night we bore out to Sea.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> the fir&s;t day, we founded at 8 of the clock at night, and found 93 fathome water, de&s;cried land.</P>
<P>The Third day, we Anchored in the <HI>Bay</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="10">of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ets</HI> before <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> Mr. <HI>Tinges</HI> other man now dyed of the &s;mall pox.</P>
<P>The Tenth day, I went a &s;hore upon <HI>Noddles</HI> I&s;land to Mr. <HI>Samuel Maverick</HI> (for my pa&s;&s;age) the only ho&s;pitable man in all the Countrey, giving entrtainment to all Comers <HI>gratis.</HI></P>
<P>Now before I proceed any further, it will not be Impertinent to give the intend|ing planter &s;ome In&s;tructions for the fur|ni&s;hing of him&s;elf with things nece&s;&s;ary, and for undertaking the Tran&s;port of his Family, or any others.</P>
<P>To which end ob&s;erve, that a Ship of 150 Tuns, with 2 Decks and a half, and 26 men, with 12 pieces of Ordnance, the charge will amount <HI>per</HI> moneth, with the Mariners, to 120 pound <HI>per</HI> moneth.

There are two &s;orts of &s;nakes, the land-&s;nake and the wa|ter-&s;nake; the water-&s;nake will be as big about the belly as the Calf of a mans leg; I never heard of any mi&s;chief that &s;nakes did, they kill them &s;ometimes for their skins and bones to make hatbands off, their skins likewi&s;e worn as a Garter is an excel|lent remedie again&s;t the cramp.

<P>The Earth-worm, the&s;e are very rare and as &s;mall as a hor&s;e hair, but there is a Bug that lyes in the earth and eateth the &s;eed, that is &s;omewhat like a Maggot of a white colour with a red head, and is about
<PB N="116" REF="63">the bigne&s;s of ones finger and an inch or an inch and half long. There is al&s;o a dark dunni&s;h Worm or Bug of the bigne&s;s of an Oaten-&s;traw, and an inch long, that in the &s;pring lye at the Root of Corn and Garden plants all day, and in the night creep out and devour them; the&s;e in &s;ome years de|&s;troy abundance of <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and Garden plants, and they have but one way to be rid of them, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have learnt of the <HI>Indians;</HI> And becau&s;e it is &s;omewhat &s;trange, I &s;hall tell you how it is, they go out into a field or garden with a Birchen|di&s;h, and &s;pudling the earth about the roots, for they lye not deep, they gather their di&s;h full which may contain about a quart or three pints, then they carrie the di&s;h to the Sea-&s;ide when it is ebbing-water and &s;et it a &s;wimming, the water carrieth the di&s;h into the Sea and within a day or two if you go into your field you may look your eyes out &s;ooner than find any of them.</P>
<P><HI>Sow-bugs</HI> or <HI>Millipedes</HI> there be good &s;tore, but none of that &s;ort that are blew and turn round as a pea when they are touched; neither are there any <HI>Beetles</HI> nor <HI>Maple-bugs,</HI> but a &s;tinking black and red <HI>Bug</HI> called a <HI>Cacarooch</HI> or <HI>Cockroach,</HI> and a little black <HI>Bug</HI> like a <HI>Lady-cow</HI> that breeds in skins and furrs and will eat them to their

Be&s;ides the&s;e there is a <HI>Bug,</HI> but whether it be a Native to the Countrie or a &s;tranger I cannot &s;ay: Some are of opinion that they are brought in by the Merchant with Spani&s;h goods, they in|fe&s;t our beds mo&s;t, all day they hide them|&s;elves, but when night comes they will creep to the &s;leeping wretch and bite him wor&s;e than a flea, which rai&s;eth a &s;welling knub that will itch intolerably, if you &s;cratch it waxeth bigger and growes to a &s;cab; and if you chance to break one of the <HI>Bugs</HI> it will &s;tink odiou&s;ly: they call them <HI>Chinches</HI> or <HI>Wood-lice,</HI> they are fat, red and in &s;hape like a <HI>Tike</HI> and no bigger. There are al&s;o Palmer-worms which is a kind of Catterpiller, the&s;e &s;ome years will devour the leaves of Trees leaving them as naked almo&s;t as in winter, they do much harm in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Orchards.

<P>The E&s;t or Swift in <HI>New-England</HI> is a mo&s;t beautiful Creature to look upon, be|ing larger than ours, and painted with glo|rious colours; but I lik'd him never the better for it.</P>
<P>Frogs too there are in ponds and upon dry land, they chirp like Birds in the &s;pring, and latter end of &s;ummer croak like Toads. It is admirable to con&s;ider the generating of the&s;e Creatures, fir&s;t they lay their gelly on the water in ponds and &s;till waters, which comes in time to be full of black &s;pots as broad as the head of a Ten|penny nail, and round, the&s;e &s;eparate them|&s;elves from the gleir, and after a while thru&s;t out a tail, then their head comes forth, after their head &s;prings out their fore-legs, and then their hinder-legs, then their tail drops off, and growes to have a head and four legs too, the fir&s;t proves a frog, the lat|ter a water-nuet.

<P>The Toad is of two &s;orts, one that is

<P>Now before I proceed any further, I mu&s;t (to prevent mi&s;con&s;tructions) tell you that the&s;e following Creatures, though they be not properly accounted Serpents, yet they are venomous and pe&s;tilent Crea|tures. As, fir&s;t the Rat, but he hath been brought in &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came thither, but the Mou&s;e is a Native, of which there are &s;everal kinds not material to be de&s;cri|bed; the Bat or flitter mou&s;e is bigger a|bundance than any in <HI>England</HI> and &s;warm, which brings me to the infects or cut-wa&s;ted creatures again, as fir&s;t the honey-Bee, which are carried over by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and thrive there exceedingly, in time they may be produced from Bullocks when the wild Bea&s;ts are de&s;troyed. But the wa&s;p is com|mon,
<PB N="121" REF="65">and they have a &s;ort of wild humble-Bee that breed in little holes in the earth. Near upon twenty years &s;ince there lived an old planter at <HI>Black-point,</HI> who on a Sun&s;hine day about one of the clock lying upon a green bank not far from his hou&s;e, charged his Son, a lad of 12 years of age to a|waken him when he had &s;lept two hours, the old man falls a&s;leep and lying upon his back gaped with his mouth wide enough for a Hawke to &s;hit into it; after a little while the lad &s;itting by &s;pied a humble-Bee creeping out of his Fathers mouth, which taking wing flew quite out of &s;ight, the hour as the lad ghe&s;t being come to awaken his Father he jogg'd him and cal|led aloud Father, Father, it is two a clock, but all would not rou&s;e him, at la&s;t he &s;ees the humble-Bee returning, who lighted up|on the &s;leepers lip and walked down as the lad conceived into his belly, and pre&s;ently he awaked.</P>
<P>The Countrey is &s;trangely incommoda|ted with flyes, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> call Musketaes, they are like our gnats, they will &s;ting &s;o fiercely in &s;ummer as to make the faces of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;well'd and &s;cab|by, as if the &s;mall pox for the fir&s;t year.

<PB N="122" REF="66">that a man cannot draw his breath, but he will &s;uck of them in: they continue about Thirty dayes &s;ay &s;ome, but I &s;ay three moneths, and are not only a pe&s;ter|ment but a plague to the Countrey. There is another &s;ort of fly called a Gurnipper that are like our hor&s;e-&s;lyes, and will bite de&s;perately, making the bloud to &s;purt out in great quantity; the&s;e trouble our <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Cattle very much, rai&s;ing &s;wellings as big as an egg in their hides. The Butterfly is of &s;everal &s;orts and larger than ours; So are their Dragon-flyes. Glow-worms have here wings, there are multitudes of them in&s;omuch that in the dark evening when I fir&s;t went into the Countrey I thought the whole Heavens had been on fire, &s;eeing &s;o many &s;parkles flying in the air: about <HI>Mount-Carmel,</HI> and the valley of <HI>Acree</HI> in the <HI>Holy-land</HI> there be abundance of them.</P>
<P>The&s;e are taken for <HI>Cantharides. Cantha|rides</HI> are green flyes by day, in the night they pa&s;s about like a flying Glow-worm with fire in their tails.</P>

<P>Their hou&s;es which they call <HI>Wigwams,</HI> are built with Poles pitcht into the ground of a round form for mo&s;t part, &s;ometimes &s;quare, they bind down the tops of their poles, leaving a hole for &s;moak to go out at, the re&s;t they cover with the bark of Trees, and line the in&s;ide of their <HI>Wigwams</HI> with mats made of Ru&s;hes painted with &s;everal colours, one good po&s;t they &s;et up in the middle that reaches to the hole in the top, with a &s;taff a cro&s;s before it at a convenient height, they knock in a pin on which they hang their Kettle, beneath that they &s;et up a broad &s;tone for a back which keepeth the po&s;t from burning; round by the walls they &s;pread their mats and skins where the men &s;leep whil&s;t their women dre&s;s theis victuals, they have commonly two doors, one ope|ning to the South, the other to the North, and according as the wind &s;its, they clo&s;e up one door with bark and hang a <HI>Dears</HI> skin or the like before the other. Towns they have none, being alwayes removing from one place to another for conveniency of food, &s;ometimes to tho&s;e places where one &s;ort of fi&s;h is mo&s;t plentiful, other whiles where others are. I have &s;een half

<P>Wives they have two or three, according to the ability of their bodies and &s;trength of their concupi&s;cence, who have the ea&s;ieft labours of any women in the world; they will go out when their time is come alone, carrying a board with them two foot long, and a foot and half broad, bor'd full of holes on each &s;ide, having a foot beneath like a Jack that we pull Boots off with, on the top of the board a broad &s;trap of lea|ther which they put over their fore-head, the board hanging at their back; when they are come to a Bu&s;h or a Tree that they fancy they lay them down and are delivered in a trice, not &s;o much as groaning for it, they wrap the child up in a young <HI>Beaver</HI>-skin with his heels clo&s;e to his britch, leaving a little hole if it be a Boy for his Cock to peep out at; and lace him down to the
<PB N="128" REF="69">board upon his back, his knees re&s;ting upon the foot beneath, then putting the &s;trap of leather upon their fore-head with the infant hanging at their back home they trudge; What other ceremonies they u&s;e more than dying of them with a liquor of boiled <HI>Hem|lock</HI>-Bark, and their throwing of them into the water if they &s;u&s;pect the Child to be gotten by any other Nation, to &s;ee if he will &s;wim, if he &s;wim they acknowledge him for their own, their names they give them when they are men grown, and covet much to be called after our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manner, <HI>Robin, Harry, Phillip</HI> and the like, very in|dulgent they are to their Children, and their children &s;ometimes to their Parents, but if they live &s;o long that they become a burden to them, they will either &s;tarve them or bury them alive, as it was &s;uppo&s;ed an <HI>Indian</HI> did his Mother at <HI>Ca&s;co</HI> in 1669.</P>
<P>Their Apparel before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came among&s;t them, was the skins of wild Bea&s;ts with the hair on, Buskins of <HI>Deers</HI>-skin or <HI>Moo&s;e</HI> dre&s;t and drawn with lines into &s;everal works, the lines being coloured with yellow, blew or red, Pumps too they have, made of tough skins without &s;oles.

<P>Their Diet is Fi&s;h and Fowl, Bear, Wild|cat, Rattoon and Deer; dry'd Oy&s;ters, <HI>Lob&s;ters</HI> ro&s;ted or dryed in the &s;moak, <HI>Lampres</HI> and dry'd <HI>Moo&s;e</HI>-tongues, which they e&s;teem a di&s;h for a <HI>Sagamor;</HI> hard eggs boiled and made &s;mall and dryed to thicken their broth with, falt they have not the u&s;e of, nor bread, their <HI>Indian</HI> Corn and Kid|ney beans they boil, and &s;ometimes eat their Corn parcht or roa&s;ted in the ear again&s;t the fire; they feed likewi&s;e upon earth-nuts,
<PB N="130" REF="70">or ground-nuts, rocts of water-Lillies, Che&s;-nuts, and divers &s;orts of Berries. They beat their Corn to powder and put it up into bags, which they make u&s;e of when &s;tormie weather or the like will not &s;uffer them to look out for their food. <HI>Pompiens</HI> and water-<HI>Mellons</HI> too they have good &s;tore; they have prodigious &s;tomachs, devouring a cruel deal, meer <HI>voragoes,</HI> never giving over eating as long as they have it, between meals &s;pending their time in &s;leep till the next kettlefull is boiled, when all is gone they &s;atisfie them&s;elves with a &s;mall quanti|ty of the meal, making it &s;erve as the fru|gal bit among&s;t the old <HI>Britains,</HI> which taken to the mountenance of a Bean would &s;atisfie both thir&s;t and hunger.

<P>The military part of their Common|wealth is governed by one Major-General, and three Serjeant Majors; to the Major-General belongeth particularly the Town of <HI>Bi&s;ton,</HI> to the three Serjeant Majors be|long the four Counties, but with &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the Major-General.

<P>Every Town &s;ends two Burge&s;&s;es to their great and &s;olemn general Court.</P>
<P>For being drunk, they either whip or im|po&s;e a fine of Five &s;hillings; &s;o for &s;wearing and cur&s;ing, or boring through the tongue with a hot Iron.</P>
<P>For k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ing a woman in the &s;treet, though in way of civil &s;alute, whipping or a fine.</P>
<P>For Single fornication whipping or a fine.</P>
<P>For Adultery, put to death, and &s;o for Witchcraft.</P>
<P>An <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> woman &s;uffering an <HI>Indian</HI> to have carnal knowledge of her, had an <HI>Indian</HI> cut out exactly in red cloth &s;ewed
<PB N="179" REF="95">upon her right Arm, and injoyned to wear it twelve moneths.</P>
<P>Scolds they gag and &s;et them at their doors for certain hours, for all comers and goers by to gaze at.</P>
<P>Stealing is puni&s;hed with re&s;toring four fould, if able; if not, they are &s;old for &s;ome years, and &s;o are poor debtors.</P>
<P>If you de&s;ire a further in&s;pection to their Laws, I mu&s;t refer you to them being in print, too many for to be in&s;erted into this Relation.</P>
<P>The Governments of their Churches are Independent and Presbyterial, every Church (for &s;o they call their particular Congre|gations) have one Pa&s;tor, one Teacher, Ruling Elders and Deacons.</P>
<P>They that are members of their Church|es have the Sacraments admini&s;tred to them, the re&s;t that are out of the pale as they phra&s;e it, are denyed it. Many hun|dred Souls there be among&s;t them grown up to men &amp; womens e&s;tate that were never Chri&s;tened.</P>
<P>They judge every man and woman to pay Five &s;hillings <HI>per</HI> day, who comes not to their A&s;&s;emblies, and impo&s;e fines of forty &s;hillings and fifty &s;hillings on &s;uch as meet together to wor&s;hip God.</P>

<P>Quakers they whip, bani&s;h, and hang if they return again.</P>
<P>Anabapti&s;ts they impri&s;on, fine and weary out.</P>
<P>The Government both Civil and Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical is in the hands of the thorow-pac'd Independents and rigid Presbyterians.</P>
<P>The gro&s;e <HI>Goddons,</HI> or great ma&s;ters, as al&s;o &s;ome of their Merchants are damnable rich; generally all of their judgement, inexplicably covetous and proud, they re|ceive your gifts but as an homage or tribute due to their tran&s;cendency, which is a fault their Clergie are al&s;o guilty of, who&s;e living is upon the bounty of their hearers. On Sundays in the afternoon when Sermon is ended the people in the Galleries come down and march two a brea&s;t up one Ile and down the other, until they come before the desk, for Pulpit they have none: before the desk is a long pue where the Elders and Deacons &s;it, one of them with a mony box in his hand, into which the people as they pa&s;s put their offering, &s;ome a &s;hilling, &s;ome two &s;hillings, half a Crown, five &s;hil|lings according to their ability and good will, after this they conclude with a P&s;alm; but this by the way.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t objects of di&s;cipline, Religi|on,

The chiefe&s;t cau&s;e of <HI>Noah</HI>'s floud, Prov. 27.26. <HI>Agni erant ad ve&s;titum tuum,</HI> is a frequent Text among them, no trading for a &s;tranger with them, but with a <HI>Graecian</HI> faith, which is not to part with your ware without ready money, for they are generally in their payments recu&s;ant and &s;low, great Syndies, or cen&s;ors, or con|trollers of other mens manners, and &s;avagely factious among&s;t them&s;elves.</P>
<P>There are main travelling women too, (in <HI>Salomon</HI>'s &s;ence) more the pitty, when a woman hath lo&s;t her Cha&s;tity, &s;he hath no more to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>But mi&s;take me not to general &s;peeches, none but the guilty take exceptions, there are many &s;incere and religious people among&s;t them, de&s;cryed by their charity and humility (the true Characters of Chri&s;tia|nity) by their Zenodochie or ho&s;pitality, by their hearty &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their Sove|raign the King of <HI>England,</HI> by their dili|gent and hone&s;t labour in their callings, among&s;t the&s;e we may account the Royali&s;ts, who are lookt upon with an evil eye and

<P>They have &s;tore of Children, and are well accommodated with Servants; many hands make light work, many hands make a full fraught, but many mouths eat up all, as &s;ome old planters have experimented; of the&s;e &s;ome are <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> others <HI>Negroes:</HI> of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there are can eat till they &s;weat, and work till they freeze; &amp; of the females that are like Mrs. <HI>Winters</HI> paddocks, very tender fingerd in cold weather.</P>

<P>The Di&s;ea&s;es that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are affli|cted with, are the &s;ame that they have in <HI>England,</HI> with &s;ome proper to <HI>New Eng|land,</HI> griping of the belly (accompanied with Feaver and Ague) which turns to the bloudy-fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">x, a common di&s;ea&s;e in the Coun|trey, which together with the &s;mall pox hath carried away abundance of their children, for this the common medicines among&s;t the poorer &s;ort are Pills of Cotton &s;wallowed, or Sugar and Sallet-oyl boiled thick and made into Pills, Alloes pulverized

Some of our <HI>New-England</HI> writers affirm that the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> are never or very rarely heard to &s;neeze or cough, as ordinarily they do in <HI>England,</HI> which is not true. For a cough or &s;titch up|on cold, Wormwood, Sage, Marygolds, and Crabs-claws boiled in po&s;&s;et-drink and drunk off very warm, is a &s;overaign medi|cine.</P>
<P>Pleuri&s;ies and Empyemas are frequent there, both cured after one and the &s;ame way; but the la&s;t is a de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;e and kills many. For the Pleuri&s;ie I have given <HI>Coriander</HI>-&s;eed prepared, <HI>Carduus</HI>-&s;eed, and <HI>Harts-horn</HI> pulverized with good &s;ucce&s;s, the do&s;e one dram in a cup of Wine.</P>
<P>The Stone terribly afflicts many, and the Gout, and Sciatica, for which take Onions roa&s;ted, peeled and &s;tampt, then boil them with neats-feet oyl and Rhum to a plai&s;ter, and apply it to the hip.</P>
<P>Head-aches are frequent, Pal&s;ies, Drop|&s;ies, Worms, Noli-me-tangeres, Cancers,
