<P>Courteous Reader.</P>
<P>_IT is not so old as true, that Truth seekes (nay brooks) no Corners, though Cha|rity doth; for (in a word) to prove them both legiti|mate, it is as bold (with Discretion) as the other is modestly bashfull; it may (for a time) be blamed, but ne|ver shamed; suspected, but not quite deiected; trodden on, but not de|stroyed; eclipsed, but not extinguisht; no, 'twill rise, and shine foorth a|gaine; comparable it is, and alike effectuall to the glorious Sunne, com|manding his entrance (vpon least advantage) through the thickest Clouds into the darkest Dungeon; where a good sight receives his light at a little hole, and reioyceth in it.</P>
<P><PB REF="3">This short Treatise following (in part) expounds my meaning, being of a Voyage I made vnto the <HI>East|Indi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> almost twenty yeares since, imployed by the Honorable Compa|ny; prosperously begun, and as well continued (notwithstanding some prime opposition) with all good pro|ceeding in grace and favor with the best; which at length (as hath hap|ned vnto many of best report) vpon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> of government there, proved to my greater preiudice, but how? Is no par cell of this discourse; yet notwithstanding, seeing that by one finger the whole hand may be propor|tioned, and by the foot the entyre bo|dy drawne out; I held it requisite (for good respects) this way to declare my selfe, and at this time especially; as high time (among many other ob|servations more generall &amp; delight|full) in such briefe passages as seemd to me most considerable, and (with|out
<PB REF="3">
all offence or prolixity vnto any) to my purpose materiall; that the honourable Company themselues, or any else of iudgment (with content and pleasure in the sweete variety, and milde composure of matter) might from thence (accidently, or by the way onely) make a neere coniec|ture at the true cause of my neglect there, &amp; vntimely departure thence, to their preiudize as my own, which here (in modesty) I silence.</P>
<P>Hauing finished my Travayles, I made bold (in a plaine Epistle) to de|dicate them vnto the Honourable Companie, as most convenient me thought; but it pleased them not to accept thereof, for reasons to them|selues best knowne; which I suppose (for I hope the best) they might in|tend, (or it may so fall out) to my aduantage; for looke how many cour|teous Readers, both of themselues and others (to whom in generall I

<P>It was so full of loue, my lost De|dication I mean (breifly preferd to all other graces, as holding the prece|dent roome in euery grace and ver|tue, morall and diuine; compared likewise to fire, fine gold and siluer of the finest; and made illustrious by Pearles, Diamonds, and Pretious stones, (yet all vndervallued as tri|fles vnto him or her, in whom this divine Grace of Graces dwelleth, as being richer then all riches, supply|ing all wants, healing all infirmi|ties, and sweeter also (in its blest ef|fects) then Hony and the Hony combe) with a reason (in a word or

<P>My History it selfe (courteous Reader), here at hand attends thy leasure, and craues thy patience, at most but an hower or two, to suruey her partes; if perhaps (at first re|port) they answer not thy expectation, as thinges too common, and alreadie past the presse; let not this diuert thee from that honest recreation which (in one respect or other) may

<P>_CAlling to minde my former Travels, and the fit Occasion of|fered me thereby, a little to communi|cate my selfe vnto the world, by a briefe relation of such short passages and ob|servations therein taken, as may mini|ster matter of some Recreation to the vniuersall Reader, from his more seri|ous studies and affaires of importance, be they whatsoever; variety or change (though in the meanest of thinges not vnlawfull) with some Novelties especially, being that (saith experience) which in all, or in most men begets de|light, aliuiates the mindes of the wi|sest, and prepares them (vpon a re|turne) with aduantage, to a better sufficiency in theyr weightiest negoti|ations;

not vnlike a Bow that stands alwayes bent, becomes weake in it selfe, and vnserviceable to others: so fares it alike with the most ingenious minds to bee still engaged, without some intermissions, some steppings a|side, though but after a slye, or a fea|ther in the ayre, to breath, to reviue our oversad, our too intensiue spirits; As once the riding of a hobby-horse with his little princely sonne, not ill be|seem'd a King; any sport for a spurt, (if honest or harmelesse, though chil|dish) contradi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ts not the Reputation of a Man; It being a point of wisdome sometimes (among the vnwise) to seeme to play the foole, as to doe it vnderstandingly, requires (they say) the best wits; of purpose to forget, improues the very Art of memorie; the way (in some cases) to aduance for|ward, is by a learned skill to retire backe; and by a discreet retreat, no small advantage is gotten; the day, the Field is ofttimes wonne; so the rea|ding of a Pamphlet, a shallow, a dis|pised worke of puft conceits, proues
<PB N="3" REF="6">
not onely not hurtfull, but beneficiall to the Wise (who suckes advantage from every thing) a helpe in his pro|gresse to his most serious intendments, bee it but for change, for recrea|tion, for variety sake onely, as I have sayd.</P>
<P>And what is there so meane (if of any moment, in the iudgements of the best) but in one respect or other, a man of a gracious wit will make some gra|cious or morall vse thereof to his owne behoofe and others, extracting Iuyce out of a dry Iuncke; sweet out of sowre; honey out of gall; preserva|tiue out of poyson; and Documents of Wisedome from Examples of Fol|ly; but this is a prerogatiue of Vertue, and peculiar to the wise onely; a Taske too hard for all, and positions abhorred by men of honestie, such as are not to be expected in the little gar|den plot of my ensuing discourse, which shall beare no noysome weedes, but (at least) harmlesse, (if not whole|some) hearbes and flowers, though (in comparison) of all other the meanes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">&punc;
<PB N="4" REF="7">
for any that will, to make a Nose-gay to smell to on a Holiday; a vacant houre, a Festivall, a time of leasure.</P>
<P>I have therefore made choise (before the rest) to write of my Travels onely to the East <HI>Indies,</HI> as well for brevity as for raritie (for to speake of all I haue seene abroad would (I know) seeme no lesse tedious then common and ri|diculous, things farre fot, and deare bought haue bin counted best and in most request) wherein I shall not bee over-curious, or too remisse to satisfie the indifferent Reader, nor yet to leaue the most iudicious (I hope) voyd of all content; none that will not, would I willingly should (as not to surfet; so neither) to goe fasting away, if short syppets in a forreyne Feast, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">an <HI>Indian</HI> Collation homely drest, and by an vn|skilfull hand hastily set forth, may (for a moment or so) eyther entertaine their curious sight, or relish their iudi|cious taste.</P>
<P>Thus by a choyce pittance, a modi|cum, a <HI>Spanish</HI> Bocado, a bit and away, carefully purveying to recreate the
<PB N="5" REF="7">
best, and to prevent disorder in the rest; however, be it gustfull or not, this benefit (to the wise) will surely follow, as to provoke the sooner to relinquish or leaue off, quicken an appetite vnto better things, and leaue the minde content to haue made a gainefull exchange by a re|fresht returne.</P>
<P>VPon a time discoursing with my selfe about the fickle Condition of worldly Estates, presented daily, and almost every where to my ob|servation; some to rise and others to fall, the same men againe to fall, and in like sort to rise (mans Indu|stry the subordinate, and Gods over|ruling Providence the prime Cause, and superintendent Agent in all; wee vainely purposing, hee alone wisely 'disposing even of all things, making them worke together (con|trary to theyr owne natures, and the intentions both of Men and Devils) for the best to them that loue him (O thrice happy and blest Estate of a
<PB N="6" REF="8">
resolute Soule loving and beloved of GOD) none so firmely standing but subiect to a declension, accidental or finall; by a decay of wealth, or at longest an expiration of our breath.</P>
<P>And having before bin well Dis|ciplin'd and confirm'd in these and other like Points of Faith. That who so lives vnto the Lord shall dye in the Lord; and all such (whether (so) living or dying) are sure to bee the Lords, securely sleeping and wa|king vnder his Omnipotent, his mercifull, and ever-watchfull pro|tection; As also, that the way to Heaven lay paralell by Sea as by Land, as neere from the East as from the West, from the North as from the South; from whence I had read should be gathered all the Elect of God in CHRIST, which (in ef|fect) I remember was my answer to Sir <HI>Thomas Smith</HI> then Governour, obiecting vnto mee the danger of the enterprise, with his cheerefull approbation following.</P>
<P>Hereupon it came into my thoughts,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
and thence (by degrees) grew into a resolution to attempt a Voyage in|to those Orientall or Easterne parts of the world, aswell (to speake after the manner of men) in hope to raise my Fortunes, as to better my Expe|rience, which doubtlesse I had ob|tayned to the full of my desires, had not God seene contrary things more expedient for mee; for a fayre way (as ever vnto any of a meane ranke that went that way) was layd open to me, which some of good note ob|serving, pronounced mee openly (by their Prognostication) to be certainly some great rich man be|fore I dyed; which (for theyr rash Oathes sake, and the better expressi|on of my bountifull mind, the onely portion (to any purpose) I ever yet possest, a large heart and an open hand to my Friend, or Foe in misery) I could wish may yet come to passe, and why not? (without offence) as well as others? so it may stand with Gods glory, and not to the wrong of any; else welcome still (bee it
<PB N="8" REF="9">
whatsoever) the good pleasure of the Almightie.</P>
<P>For Friends of neither kiffe nor kinne were raised vp vnto mee, ready to engage themselves by spea|king and doing for me whatsoever might, and did procure me Credit with the Governour and Commit|tees, even vnto bonds; whose loue and merit I shall bee ever prest (to my power) vpon all occasions, (change they or change they not) to requite and honour; by whose meanes my Parentage was honou|red; my parts commended; and (vp|on tryall) both in private confe|rence, and in full Courts openly ap|proued; my sallary was assigned me; my place appoynted; and in them both made equall (at least) with ma|ny of my betters.</P>
<P>In fine, there was nothing wan|ting on the honourable Companies part or my Friends behalfe, that might aboad vnto me all wisht pros|perity, but that (in some others) which (for loue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> sake) I am willing
<PB N="9" REF="9">
in silence to passe over, as also to shunne all impertinent, and superslu|ous matter, though the onely stum|bling-blocke in the way of my so faire proceedings to my future Pre|ferments then; and (in effect, as originally) ever since; for loue, (I am taught) covers a multitude of Infirmities, but vncovers none.</P>
<P>Briefly then, to shut vp my Intro|duction, and to the matter it selfe; All things being in readines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e, and prepared for our intended Voyage, the Companies Orders with our Commission sealed vp and sent a|boord; yards a crosse, and a fayre winde, that now tis time to prose|cute my purpose, and to lanch forth into the deepes.</P>
<P>OVr Fleet (therefore) consisted of Foure good Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Newyeares guift,</HI> and the <HI>Hector;</HI> the Marchants <HI>Hope,</HI> and the <HI>Salo|mon;</HI> which together set sayle from the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ownes,</HI> about the Ninth of <HI>March,</HI> 1613. of burthen from

<P>Our Generall, or cheife Comman|der, an vnderstanding Gentleman, Captaine <HI>Nicolas Downton,</HI> whose religious Orders, (besides the ho|norable Companies) both for diuine duties&punc; and ciuill societie, publisht and hung vp in euery shippe, with his owne good Example (no doubt) preuented many grosse offences, which vsually happen in promiscu|ous multitudes.</P>
<P>Our Marchants or Factors were many, well nigh thirty, and most of them men of Experience as euer the Company imployed any; Linguists, and Residents in forraigne Coun|tryes; as <HI>Turki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, Barbarie, Spaine,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> with other places of best co~merce, whereof foure were Princi|pals,

<P>Our ordinarie meanes to stirre vp mens affections to goodnesse, as Prayer and diuine Seruice twice a day, on the Sabbaths especially, and choyce of good Bookes (in com|mon) of the Companies prouiding to that end (to the comfort of all) were not wanting; besides a Preacher in his monthly visites, for Instructi|on, and Ministration of the Sacra|ment.</P>
<P>Our places of refreshing were three, the first <HI>Cape boon Speranc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> which affoorded vs plenty of <HI>Booes</HI> and <HI>Baas,</HI> or Beeues and Sheepe for small pieces of Copper, whereof the

Saluages make themselues Rings and Bracelets; they goe all naked, saue onely before, a little flappe; and feed (as they looke and smell) most nastily; subtill they are, theevish, and very treacherous; their Houses are like Bee-hives, and many together make a Towne, wherewith (vpon occasion of changing theyr heards to fresh pastures, or the sight of two or three Muskets, wherat they tremble) away they skuddle (euery one his Castle on his back) posting to a new Plantation.</P>

bush should sodenly surprise vs) at the end of three weekes or there|abouts wee set sayle agayne, and not long after came to an Anker at Saint <HI>Lawrence</HI> Iland, in the Bay of Saint <HI>Augustine.</HI></P>
<P>Here wee landed and traded three dayes with the people, and had large and fat Oxen for fiue shillings an Oxe, most curious Darts and of diuers fashions as Art could make, and bright as siluer, for halfe a Ryall or Three-pence, but without siluer wee could haue nothing, which they knew from counterfeit as well as any; wee saw no Towne nor house they had, though (doubtlesse) better then the <HI>Soldanians</HI> prouided, by good con|iectures, for theyr carriage had a glosse of humanity, a tincture of vn|derstanding; theyr persons full of proportion and comely feiture; tall, straight, strong, and sturdy; fierce of Countenan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">; admirable ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">kes|men at the Dart, and actiue; verie faire and blacke as Iett (for the

<P>Our last touch was at <HI>Socato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">,</HI> where wee found a King; not a Na|tiue, but of the royall blood of the antient Kings of <HI>Barbarie;</HI> who got this small Iland by Conquest, and held the Natiues in great seruitude, whome our Generall presented, and would haue entertained aboord the Shippes, but he refused it; yet for three or foure dayes space, came downe daily to the water side from his Castle, with his guard of soldiers borne in a <HI>Palanquine,</HI> and after the <HI>Moorish</HI> fashion (crosse-legged) sit|ting in state vnder a rich Cannopie vppon Turky Carpets spread on the ground, and as richly clad in

<P>And thus weying and setting sayle agayne (with starbord and larboord; port and helme al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e) we steered on our Course, till with the helpe of God, and our constant <HI>Monsoone,</HI> or westerly trade winde, we verie hap|pily (but hardly) recouered the Rendeuous to <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rat,</HI> and came to an Anker in the Roade of <HI>Swall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e,</HI> about the tenth, of Nouember, and of our great Company (thankes bee to God) lost onely one man, who came sicke of an Ague out of <HI>England,</HI> but here quickly they began to dye fast|er of Fluxes and Feauers.</P>
