<HEAD>From <HI>Naples,</HI> the <HI>6.</HI> of Ianuary.</HEAD>
<P>Vpon Tue&s;day morning about one of the clocke, being the 16. of <HI>December,</HI> the Mountaine of <HI>Soma</HI> about 6. miles from <HI>Naples</HI> brake forth into a very &s;trange and marveilous burning, wo~derfully a&s;toni&s;hing the Inhabitants round about; and continued with great violence for the &s;pace of two daies covering, or rather burning the neighboring Townes round about with a&s;hes therof: many both men women &amp; children burned, multitudes leaving their habitations, e&s;caped onely with their liues, fleeing with their children to <HI>Naples</HI> for re|fuge,
<PB N="5" REF="4"> where indeed tho&s;e of this Citie haue not wonted to extend their Charitie towards the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch abundant mea&s;ure. The hor&s;es, oxen, &s;heep, &amp; other annimals left behind them, were all de&s;troyed by the fires extremitie; the which evaporated forth mo&s;t hideous noy&s;e, much like Thunder, or the noy&s;e of great Ordnance, which we of <HI>Naples</HI> heard as ea&s;ily as if we had beene clo&s;e by it. The force of this fire was &s;uch, that it &s;ent forth pieces of the Mine weighing aboue an hundred weight two miles di&s;tant from the place. I &s;poke with them that out of curio&s;itie went within 3. miles of the Mount, but &s;uch pieces fell neere vnto them, checking their hardine&s;&s;e, that feare cau&s;ed their retyre with great a&s;toni&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>But that which hath admini&s;tred mo&s;t terror, was the con|tinuance of Earthquakes ever &s;ince the Mount began to burne the mo&s;t violent were the fir&s;t two dayes, which happened once in a quarter of an houre, which &s;o far affrighted the <HI>Ne|apolitants,</HI> that they greatly feared the &s;inking of the City, or the falling downe of their hou&s;es vpon their heads. Many therefore fled out of the City into other remote places, the Viceroy purpo&s;ing to doe the like was prevented, becau&s;e not thought fit of the Collaterall. Many through feare &s;ought out vacant places, where they might repo&s;e them&s;elues in their clothes in the night &s;ea&s;on, others building &s;heds of boards to &s;helter them&s;elues: for the &s;pace of two houres the Levant windes, that is the Ea&s;t, blew the &s;moake towards the City, which much ob&s;cured the ayre, and the &s;treets almo&s;t an inch thicke with a&s;hes which came from the Mount: and if the wind had continued, it would haue driven, or cau&s;ed all the people to haue fled out of the City; but a Ponnent wind that is a We&s;t hapned, thanked be God it hath not much annoyed the City, but hath burnt vp a great part of the Country. The a&s;hes I am credibly informed extending to <HI>Burletta,</HI> which is aboue 60. Engli&s;h miles from the place: &s;ince the fir&s;t two dayes the Earthquakes are not &s;o frequent, neither &s;o violent, but do &s;till continue. Evident are the demon&s;trations of their humiliation. It were incredible to relate the number of their
<PB N="6" REF="5"> proce&s;&s;ions, for their great and numberle&s;&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; and that by the people of every condition, in divers manners. Some by the Viceroy and Nobilitie were performed in mo&s;t &s;olemne manner; &s;o al&s;o by the Cardinall on his bare feete, with other of the Clergie: great quantity of men mo&s;t grie|vou&s;ly whipping them&s;elues vp and downe in token of their humilitie. Many were the men al&s;o that in pennitentiall ha|bits went bare footed in their proce&s;&s;ions: &s;o in like manner women with their haire hanging loo&s;e about their eares; and of the&s;e the greate&s;t part were whores, which for number are more then a good many, being e&s;timated to bee aboue 40. thou&s;and (&s;ome are of opinion many more) thirty thou&s;and are regi&s;tred, and pay the <HI>Gabella.</HI> Their proce&s;&s;ions were day and night, grieveous and dolefull were their cryes in ge|nerall. By the commaund of the Viceroy all &s;hops were &s;hut in for foure dayes, and every one to devote them&s;elues to fa|&s;ting, praying, and pious actions: and that if any &s;hould be found in the hou&s;e of a whore, to forfeit 2000. Duckets, and the whore to be whipt about the City, &amp; bani&s;hed the King|dome. Men not able to pay the penaltie, to be &s;ent to the Gal|lies; (as a thing mo&s;t rare) the whores confe&s;&s;e them&s;elues in great abundance, &s;ome retire into Mona&s;teries, many con|verted, and great hope of reformation expected. In fine the hill is much con&s;umed, and continueth burning, the vent be|ing much inlarged, and Earthquakes (God be thanked) cea&s;ed.</P>

<P>I would often haue written unto you, but that I know no letters could pa&s;&s;e. Now under&s;tanding the po&s;ts are againe e&s;tabli&s;hed, according to the former cour&s;e, from hence to <HI>Dre&s;den,</HI> I will againe returne to my wonted cour&s;e and write unto you every week. And to make a beginning, you may be plea&s;ed to know,
<PB N="12" REF="8"> That on the thirteenth of this pre&s;ent Moneth there arrived &s;evearll troopes of <HI>Crabats</HI> here before the gate called the gate of <HI>Wi&s;&s;enberg</HI> (or white-hill) and intended to &s;urpri&s;e or take the Towne by force, whereupon three pieces of Ordnance (which is the to|ken or warning of the enemies approach) being &s;hot off. The Colonell Commander of the Towne, a Baron of <HI>Hofkirk,</HI> &s;ent out &s;ome companies of hor&s;e which &s;ell on the enemy, who quickly betooke him&s;elfe to flight, leaving many dead and &s;ome pri&s;oners behind them. The next day (the 14.) the enemy arrived a|gaine in good earne&s;t, having placed behind the Cra|bats, about 1000. Mu&s;quetiers, and about 1000. Dra|gons to flanke them. There the enemy approaching neare the Towne, found pre&s;ently ready to receive him. The two Companies of hor&s;e of <HI>Arnheyms</HI> his guard, and &s;ome other troopes, who had placed &s;ome Mu&s;quetiers into &s;ome low ground. Now the &s;aid two hor&s;e Companies of <HI>Arnheym</HI> having met with the e|nemy, turned quickly backe and fled, and the enemy pur&s;uing them eagerly, pa&s;&s;e neare the place, where the Mu&s;quetiers lying hidden, &s;aluted them &s;o &s;uddenly, that a great many tumbled downe from their hor&s;es, and the re&s;t began to flye backe; Whereupon the ene|my with a rea&s;onable Army appeared on the high ground, and made &s;hew as if he intended to take the Towne by force. Then our forces were brought back into the Towne, and all things prepared for defence. Every one taking his appointed places both in the new Sconces and in the fortifications, and the Governour of the little Towne, being a Count of <HI>Solms</HI> cau&s;ed two field pieces to be placed upon a high hou&s;e in a Gar|den, whereby he did &s;o trouble &s;ome troupes of the e|nemy that came neare; that &s;eeing all was to with|&s;tand him, he made againe his retreat. Now when we &s;aw that he was turning backe, our hor&s;e being ready
<PB N="13" REF="8"> to fall out upon the enemies Reere, then pre&s;ently the Ie&s;uites began to ring the bels of their Church. Where|upon the enemy had a mind to come againe on, but our Ordnance doing great harme among&s;t him, he we~t quite away; And the Governours and Magi&s;trates ta|king all po&s;&s;ible and &s;peedy paines to know the rea&s;on of the Ie&s;uites ringing, they found out that the Ie&s;u|ites had had an intelligence and con&s;piracy with the enemy. Whereupon their Colledge being vi&s;ited, there was found great provi&s;ion of munition and of Armes, for many hundred men, which were ready to bee u&s;ed both by the Ie&s;uites them&s;elves and others their friends, who endeavoured to make &s;ome troubles and would have made a great uprore, (had the enemy got|ten one gate or any entry into <HI>Prague</HI>) to favour his de&s;igne, and to helpe to kill tho&s;e within the Towne. Thus God having delivered us, and di&s;covered their trea&s;on, there was pre&s;ently on the very &s;ame day pub|li&s;hed a prohibition that no Bell at all &s;hould more bee rung in the three Townes of <HI>Prague,</HI> and that none &s;hould be &s;uffered to goe out or to come in, untill fur|ther order.</P>
<P>On the 15. of this, there were put certaine compa|nies of &s;ouldiers, as for Garri&s;on into the two Colled|ges of the Ie&s;uites in <HI>Prague,</HI> the one whereof is built in the old Towne, and the other in the little Towne.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixeteenth the Magi&s;trates vi&s;ited the &s;ayd Colledge, and found many warlike provi&s;ions and In&s;truments. Whereupon it was con&s;ulted and con|cluded they &s;hould bee &s;ent out of the Towne yet that Evening: And indeed there were already divers Coaches and Waggons ready before their Col|ledge, for the tran&s;port of tho&s;e irreverend Fa|thers and Traytors which I &s;aw my &s;elfe. &mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="9"> But it was delayed untill the next morning. And &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>On the 17 very early executed, and all Ie&s;uites &s;ent away, &s;o that now we are rid of that plague. Their Colledge of the little Town is now given unto and in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Carmelites, who dwelled before in the Dutch Church, given to them &s;oone after the battell of <HI>Prague,</HI> and the Ie&s;uites Colledge of old <HI>Prague</HI> &s;ell to the &s;hare of the <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Fryers, who are very well content of it.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day la&s;t the Lord of <HI>Hofkirch</HI> cau&s;ed the fir&s;t Sermon to be preached againe in the Dutch Church of the old Towne, and after Sermon his Lord&s;hip and ma|ny Noblemen, Officers and great multitude of people received the Communion.</P>
<P>The fore&s;aid Count of <HI>Solms,</HI> being a very provident and wi&s;e man, cau&s;ed the yce of the River of <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">da</HI> to be broken up, that there is no pa&s;&s;age neyther for root nor for hor&s;e, he hath al&s;o cau&s;ed &s;ome Ordnance to be placed upon the White Tower, which he hath cau&s;ed to be mended, whereby we hope to with&s;tand the enemy, and keepe the Towne.</P>
<P>The Boores are very re&s;olute in the Country, and they di&s;cover and &s;earch out all &s;uch as are affected to|wards the enemy, &s;ome they Dill, &s;ome they take Pri|&s;oners and bring them to be examined. Ye&s;terday they brought a Pri&s;oner who had tyed certaine Letters un|der his privy parts, which Letters I know not what they contained, but the carrier is to be hangd.</P>
<P>Now we receive newes, that the Imperiali&s;ts en|deavouring to take <HI>Brande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> have beene well beaten for their labour by our Garri&s;on that lyes there, con|&s;i&s;ting onely of three hundred Mu&s;quetiers of the yel|low Regiment.</P>
<P>Thus much for this time, the next Weeke I hope I &s;hall &s;end you yet better newes, but I wi&s;h to know whether or no you receive my Letters</P>
