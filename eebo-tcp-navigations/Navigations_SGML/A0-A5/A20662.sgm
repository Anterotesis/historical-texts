<HEAD>A true report of a mo&s;t famous <HI>vic|torie, atchieued by a certain ve&s;&s;ell, called the black</HI> Galley of Dort, vpon the 30. day of Nouember la&s;t, 1600 which at that time tooke the Admirall of the Citie of Antwerpe, with &s;euen other &s;hippes, all <HI>well furni&s;hed with munition for warre.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_COn&s;idering the Lordes the generall E&s;tates of <HI>Hol|land</HI> and <HI>Sealand,</HI> haue thought good to cau&s;e to be made and appoynted a Galley, to the ende that therewith, and with the ayde of &s;ome &s;hips of war, they may hinder the Gal|lies of the Sluce, the which do daily co~mit great &s;poyle on the &s;ea: &s;o it is, that by the con&s;ent of the Lords the Generall E&s;tates, there hath beene made and appoynted at <HI>Dort,</HI> a certaine Galley being well prouided, with all manner of munition &s;eruing to the warre, and al&s;o well furni&s;hed with great Ordinance. This Galley was called the blacke Galley of <HI>Dort,</HI> the which being wel manned with men of warre of <HI>Dort</HI> afore|&s;ayd, was &s;et forth towards <HI>Sealand,</HI> to the ende there to conuoy the Marchants &s;hippes, which are to pa&s;&s;e to|wards <HI>England, Fraunce, Scotland,</HI> and Ea&s;t <HI>Free&s;land,</HI> or to any other places.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>Immediately after, it happened that this afore&s;ayde black Gallie being at &s;ea, and &s;eeing three Gallyes of the Sluce which had taken a &s;hippe, which was compa&s;&s;ed betw&eacute;ene two Gallies, being determined to carrie the &s;ame into the Hauen of the Sluce, the &s;ayde blacke Galley hindred them of their purpo&s;e, and came pre&s;ently in all ha&s;te to helpe the &s;ame &s;hippe, di&s;charging her Ordinance very vehe|mently at one of the &s;ayde Gallyes, &s;o that &s;hee did al|mo&s;t vtterly &s;poyle the &s;ame, and made her gladde to &s;lippe away. Then with all ha&s;te following the other two Gal|lies which had taken the &s;hip, &s;hee &s;o di&s;charged her Ordi|nance at them, that they were con&s;trained to leaue the &s;hippe, and &s;aue them&s;elues: &s;o that the &s;ayd Galley of <HI>Dort</HI> did relea&s;e the &s;hippe, and the thr&eacute;e Gallies fledde a|way into the Sluce: howbeit, they were verie much enda|maged by the &s;hot of the blacke Galley.</P>
<P>1600. betw&eacute;ene the nine &amp; twentie, and thirtie dayes of the moneth of Nouember, the &s;ayde blacke Galley of <HI>Dort,</HI> with three or 4. Sloopes which were with her, vn|dertooke a woorthie fact before the Citie of <HI>Antwerpe,</HI> where they with a &s;tout enterpri&s;e &s;ey&s;ed on the Admiralles &s;hippe, which was well appoynted with Ordinance, hauing in her &s;ixteene bra&s;&s;e p&eacute;eces, and tenne iron ca&s;t p&eacute;eces of ordinance, with certaine &s;tone ca&s;t peeces, which Ordi|nance lay thr&eacute;e rowes high: and the &s;ayde Admiralles &s;hip is of the burden of about ninetie la&s;ts, being &s;o fayre a &s;hip, that there is none like the &s;ame in all <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Sealand.</HI> Likewi&s;e they tooke al&s;o the &s;hippe of <HI>Bru&s;&s;ell,</HI> in the which were foure bra&s;&s;e peeces of Ordinance, with the &s;hippe of <HI>Mechelen,</HI> containing foure bra&s;&s;e peeces: and moreouer, fiue conuoy &s;hippes, containing euerie of them foure p&eacute;eces of Ordinance, which 8. &s;hippes appoynted as afore&s;aide, were taken by the &s;ayde blacke Galley, with thr&eacute;e or foure Sloopes which were with her, they being in daunger of
<PB N="3" REF="3"> their liues: for when they pa&s;&s;ed by <HI>Oordam,</HI> tho&s;e of the Sconce thought them to bee Sloops, which carried muni|tion and prouant toward <HI>Hul&s;t</HI> in Flanders, but they were other Sloops, which they had not expected: but becau&s;e they tooke them to bee friendes, tho&s;e of <HI>Oordam</HI> did not di&s;charge their Ordinance at them. And our Galley being pa&s;t the Sconce, they pre&s;ently aboarded the Admirall. The Mari|ners whereof, &s;ome were &s;lain, and &s;ome leapt ouer-boord and were drowned, except two boyes, which they brought with them.</P>
<P>Thus happened it with the &s;ayde &s;hippe the Admirall, and with the &s;hippe of <HI>Bru&s;&s;ell,</HI> the &s;hip of <HI>Mechelen,</HI> and the fiue other conuoy &s;hippes, the which were brought to <HI>Flu|&s;hing,</HI> where they lie together. The Burgars of <HI>Antwerpe</HI> were verie fearefull, and did &s;hut their gates, without ope|ning them againe in two dayes, k&eacute;eping careful watch, fea|ring they were betrayed.</P>
<P>In this worthie victorie, they got the &s;ayde fayre &s;hippe of the Admiralles, the &s;hip of <HI>Bru&s;&s;ell,</HI> and the &s;ayde &s;hippe of <HI>Mechelen,</HI> and the &s;ayd fiue conuoy &s;hippes, in which eight &s;hippes were fiftie foure peeces of Ordinance, be&s;ides certaine &s;tone peeces, which were in the Admiralles. And this is the Galley, whereof men did often talke, &s;aying that it would prooue lo&s;t labour for this countrey: but it hath appeared to the contrarie, by this worthie fact happened, as is afore&s;ayd.</P>
<P>This worthie victorie haue tho&s;e of the blacke Galley obtained, with &s;mall lo&s;&s;e of their men, to witte, there were &s;laine in the winning of the&s;e eight &s;hips foure of our men, and &s;ixe were hurt. What&s;oeuer they now are doing, with the helpe of God, the time will make manife&s;t.</P>

<L>Therefore I haue tearmed this a Romane fact,</L>
