<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THE en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e contains an Account of the Pre&s;ent State of His Maje&s;ties Dominions, on the Coa&s;t of <HI>America;</HI> wherein thou wilt find a con&s;iderable Di&s;covery of the growing Greatne&s;s of tho&s;e di&s;tant Colonies, which, by the mo&s;t clement and wi&s;e Admini&s;tration of the Monarchs of <HI>Great Britan,</HI> have al|ready arrived to a Figure &s;o Con&s;iderable, as may attract the Emulation of the Neigh|bouring Potentates; the Golden <HI>Peru</HI> hardly affording &s;o great a Trea&s;ure to the <HI>Catholick</HI> Crown, as the&s;e mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing Plantati|ons produce to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> The va&s;t Returns which the Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> and other Parts of His Maje&s;ties Dominions, make from tho&s;e Parts, are a &s;ufficient En|couragement for any one that would &s;tudy the Improvement of his Fortunes, to look into the advantages of that Exten&s;ive Traf|fick
<PB REF="4"> which tho&s;e Regions produce. And &s;ince our Neighbours have not been wanting (in the mo&s;t Remote Courts) to repre&s;ent their Foreign Plantations as va&s;t and mighty Acce&s;&s;ions to their Government, and to make their State look the more Con&s;iderable in the Eyes of di&s;tant Monarchs: Why may not an E&s;&s;ay towards the Delineation of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Territories in Foreign Parts (at lea&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure) contribute to rai&s;e in them an E&s;teem and Dread of the Mighty Power of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Crown. Little more need be &s;aid to recommend the u&s;efulne&s;s of the en|&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e, but that the natural re&s;ult of Di&s;coveries, is the Promotion of Improve|ment, and the Con&s;iderate know how to make their Advantages thereof.</P>
<P>There was intended to be added to this Volume, a Summary of the &s;everal Laws in Force in each Plantation, but that being a work which will &s;well to a larger Bulk than this, is re&s;erved for a particular Treati&s;e by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I have one thing more to adverti&s;e thee, That the Printer hath neglected to fix the Running-Title on the top of every Page; therefore thou may'&s;t find that part of the Di&s;cour&s;e which relates to them in the fol|lowing Table.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>JAMAICA,</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>JAMAICA</HI> is &s;itu|ate between the <HI>Tropicks</HI> &s;eventeen or eighteen degrees <HI>North-Latitude,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Scituation.</NOTE> upon the Sea u&s;ually known by the Name of <HI>Mare del Nort,</HI> being about an hundred and forty Leagues North of the Main Continent of <HI>America;</HI> fifteen

<P>'Tis &s;omewhat of an Oval Form, and hath a continued Ridge of lofty <HI>Mountains</HI> running from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>West,</HI> which extend them&s;elves from one end of it to the other, and being full of fre&s;h Springs, furni&s;heth the <HI>I&s;land</HI> with great plenty of plea&s;ant and u&s;eful <HI>Rivers,</HI> to the great refre&s;h|ment of the Inhabitants, and accommodation of Trade.</P>
<P>It is exceeding fruitful, being for the mo&s;t part a rich fat &s;oyl,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Fertility.</NOTE> the Earth blacki&s;h, and mixt with clay, except in the <HI>South-west</HI> parts, where it is gene|rally of a more red and loo&s;e <HI>Earth;</HI> but every where wonderful fertil, and incomparably apt to an&s;wer the <HI>Cultivator's</HI> expectation, and recom|pence his pains and expence in planting; for it enjoys a perpetual <HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ing,</HI> and its <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Trees</HI> are never di&s;rob'd of their <HI>Summer Livery,</HI> but every Month is to them like <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May</HI> to us.</P>
<P>It is in length about 170 Miles, and about 70 in breadth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Form aad Extent.</NOTE> contain|ing between four or five Millions of Acres, nine hundred thou&s;and where|of were planted in the Year 1675. There are intermixt with the <HI>Woods</HI> and <HI>Mountains,</HI> many <HI>Savanaes</HI> or <HI>Plains,</HI> which are &s;uppo&s;ed to have formerly been Fields of <HI>Indian Maiz</HI> or <HI>Wheat;</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> when they made them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters of the I&s;le, and had de&s;troyed all the <HI>Na|tives,</HI> to the number of about &s;ixty thou&s;and Per|&s;ons, converted them to Pa&s;ture for the feeding of
<PB N="3" REF="11"> <HI>Hor&s;es, Cows, Hogs,</HI> and other Cattel which they brought with them for Breed; which they did &s;o fa&s;t, that there are now great Heards of <HI>Hor&s;es</HI> and other <HI>Cattel</HI> running wild in the <HI>Woods.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Savanaes</HI> are accounted the mo&s;t barren parts of the I&s;land, in regard they have lain &s;o long with|out <HI>Tillage;</HI> which notwith&s;tanding doth produce &s;uch va&s;t quantities of <HI>Gra&s;s,</HI> that the <HI>Planters</HI> are oftentimes con&s;trained to burn it up.</P>
<P>The <HI>Air</HI> is there very &s;erene and clear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Tempera|ture.</NOTE> and more <HI>temperate</HI> than in any other <HI>I&s;lands</HI> in tho&s;e parts; and in reference to Heat, is as mild as in any place that lieth between the Tropicks, in regard it is continually fann'd and cool'd by fre&s;h Breezes, which continually blow <HI>Ea&s;twardly;</HI> be&s;ide which, 'tis refre&s;hed with frequent <HI>Showers</HI> of <HI>Rain,</HI> and great <HI>Dews</HI> which fall in the night, and conduce very much to the quickning the growth of what is planted; &s;o that it may truly be called <HI>temperate</HI> and <HI>healthful;</HI> and its continual <HI>Verdure</HI> commends it as one of the mo&s;t delightful Places in the <HI>World</HI> to live in, e&s;pecially the <HI>South</HI> part of the I&s;le; the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West</HI> parts being &s;omewhat more &s;ubject to <HI>Rains</HI> and <HI>Winds,</HI> and in regard the <HI>Mountainous</HI> and <HI>Woody</HI> renders the Air le&s;s whol&s;om and agreeable than it is in the <HI>North;</HI> but e&s;pecially the <HI>Southern,</HI> which gave the occa|&s;ion to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to build <HI>Port-Royal</HI> there; it being thought convenient that the chief <HI>Port</HI> and <HI>Capital City</HI> be upon the be&s;t Spot they could find out in the I&s;land. However no part of this <HI>I&s;land</HI> is in the lea&s;t &s;ubject to tho&s;e violent and injuri|ous Storms called <HI>Hurricans,</HI> wherewith the <HI>Ca|ribbies</HI> and &s;ome other places in tho&s;e parts are &s;ometimes pe&s;tered; which with a &s;udden fury
<PB N="4" REF="12"> drive their Ships from Harbour, ca&s;t them on &s;hore, blow down their Hou&s;es, tear up their Canes, and hurry all into confu&s;ion. And had not this <HI>I&s;land</HI> afforded Relief to many of the wracked Inhabitants when they had been thus di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed, they mu&s;t in all probability have peri&s;hed. Nor doth any part of this I&s;land unavoidably ne|ce&s;&s;itate any of its new Inhabitants to any parti|cular Di&s;temper, as <HI>Virginia</HI> and other places do; but if tho&s;e who go thither, will upon their Ar|rival, but forbear exce&s;s of eating and drink|ing, u&s;e moderate exerci&s;e, and make choice of &s;uch places for their &s;ettlement, as lie not too low in Vallies, where there comes but little Air; or too near Rivers, where they may peradventure be incommoded with too much moi&s;ture, or at the Foot of <HI>Mountains</HI> or <HI>Mora&s;&s;es,</HI> where probably you may have more Rain than you'l de&s;ire; nor by the Sea &s;ide, or upon Bays, where be&s;ides the inconvenience of its Sandine&s;s, it will occa&s;ion your want of good Water, you will be mightily af|flicted with the violent Reflections of the Sun's Beams, which are much fiercer here than in other parts of the I&s;le.</P>
<P>It hath been ob&s;erved by &s;ome who have lived in the I&s;land, that the Mountains which run along through the mid&s;t of the I&s;le from one extream point to the other, are much cooler than the other parts; in&s;omuch that &s;ometimes in the Morning early there are &s;mall white Fro&s;ts.</P>
<P>As for the Weather, it is le&s;s cer|tain in <HI>Jamaica</HI> than in the re&s;t of the <HI>Caribby I&s;lands;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Air.</NOTE> but wet Sea&s;ons are mo&s;t expected in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>November.</HI> The Winds blow con&s;tantly from the <HI>East</HI> without the lea&s;t variation, which they call <HI>Briezes:</HI> They u&s;ually
<PB N="5" REF="12"> ri&s;e about Nine in the Morning, and blow fre&s;her as the Sun mounts higher; &s;o that Travel and La|bour are tolerable at Mid-day. The&s;e Ea&s;terly Winds commonly blow till about &s;ix or &s;even in the Afternoon, and then they change to the We&s;t; which the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> call <HI>Land-Briezes,</HI> becau&s;e they blow off the Shoar, and carry their Ships and Ve&s;|&s;els out of their Harbors.</P>
<P>There is no apparent Winter, only they have &s;omewhat more Rain and Thunder in the Winter-Months than at other times; nor doth the length of the Days and Nights vary much, but they con|tinue almo&s;t all the year round of an equal length, <HI>(viz.)</HI> about fifteen hours day: And that which &s;eems much &s;tranger, is, the Seas having &s;eldom been ob&s;erved to ebb or flow above a foot or there|abouts; nor hath any Pilot ever yet been able to give a certain account of the Currents of tho&s;e Seas, in regard they are &s;o various and uncertain; nor could any ever give a rea&s;on why the Hurri|cans and Earthquakes &s;hould never reach <HI>Jamaica,</HI> although they have &s;o grievou&s;ly afflicted the adja|cent I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Rivers of this I&s;land are none of them fair or navigable up into the Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Road and Harbors.</NOTE> in regard the I&s;land is very mountainous, and their original is for the mo&s;t part in tho&s;e Hills that run through its Center; which running Ea&s;t and We&s;t, the Rivers that ri&s;e in them di&s;embogue them&s;elves North and South, and falling out of tho&s;e high Mountains, are very fierce and rapid in their mo|tion; being likewi&s;e in regard of the great Rains, &s;ubject to great and &s;udden Inundations; at which times they fall with &s;uch fury, that great Stone-Rocks and large pieces of Timber are born down,
<PB N="6" REF="13"> and carried along by the violence of the Tor|rent, which makes their u&s;ual pa&s;&s;age &s;o foul and trouble&s;om, that they are thereby rendred alto|gether unpa&s;&s;able by Boats and other &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els. Be&s;ides which, there are divers of them which at &s;ome times have not one drop of Water in them, but are wholly dried up, which renders them likewi&s;e u&s;ele&s;s for Navigation; as particu|larly that of <HI>Minoa,</HI> that runs through <HI>Clarendon,</HI> which &s;ometimes hath not a drop of Water, and yet at other Sea&s;ons hath as much as the River of <HI>Thames</HI> at high-water: But although the Rivers are thus u&s;ele&s;s, yet towards the Sea the I&s;land a|bounds with great plenty of very good Bays, Roads and Harbours; the principal whereof are,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Port-Royal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Port-Royal.</NOTE> which at it fir&s;t &s;etling by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;oon after they took the I&s;land from the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> received the Name of <HI>Cagway,</HI> but when the Town began to encrea&s;e, and draw towards its perfection, it obtained in Sir <HI>Charles Littleton</HI>'s time the Name of <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> in regard of the ex|cellency of its Harbour. It is &s;ituated on the ex|tream end of that long point of Land that makes the Harbour, running about twelve Miles from the Main We&s;terly, having the Sea on its South, and the Harbour on the North; which Harbour is &s;o exceeding &s;afe and commodious for Shipping, that they are &s;ecure in all Weathers, and can un|lade them&s;elves afloat at the Merchants-Key; be|ing likewi&s;e during their Riding there, &s;ecured from any Attempts that might be made on them by an Enemy, by one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Ca&s;tles that His Maje&s;ty hath in all <HI>Ame|merica,</HI> which is well garri&s;onn'd with Souldiers, and hath above &s;ixty Pieces of Cannon mounted in
<PB N="7" REF="13"> it. Be&s;ides which, it is Land-lock'd by a Point of Land that runs Twelve Miles <HI>South-East</HI> from the Main of the I&s;land, and hath the great River which runs by <HI>Los-Angelos</HI> and St. <HI>Jago</HI> (where Ships that trade to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> commonly water, and provide them&s;elves with what Wood they want for their Voyage back) falling into it. The Harbour is about three Leagues broad in mo&s;t places, and is &s;o deep, that a Ship of a Thou&s;and Tun may lay her &s;ides to the Shoar of the Point, and load and unload at plea&s;ure; nor doth there want good Anchorage in any part of it. This Harbour being &s;o exceeding &s;afe and commodious, is the rea&s;on why it is frequented both by Mer|chants Ships and Men of War more than any other Port in that I&s;land.</P>
<P>The Point of Land whereon the Town is built, is exceeding narrow, and nothing but a loo&s;e Sand, &s;o that it affords neither <HI>Gra&s;s, Stone, fre&s;h Water, Trees,</HI> nor any thing el&s;e which could encourage the building a Town upon it, be&s;ides the goodne&s;s of the Harbour. It was at fir&s;t began by building a few Ware-hou&s;es, but is now grown exceeding large and populous; for it contains above fifteen hundred Hou&s;es, and extends it&s;elf about twelve or thirteen Miles in length, being inhabited by Merchants, Store-hou&s;e-keepers, Handicraft&s;men, Vintners, Victuallers, and the like: And being &s;o very populous, and &s;o much frequented by Stran|gers, as well as the Planters in the Negotiation of their Affairs, it being, as it were, the Scale of Trade in that I&s;land, the Hou&s;es are as dear rented as in well Traded Streets in <HI>London,</HI> and Provi&s;i|ons are dearer than in any other place in that I&s;land.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="14">
<P>In the time of the Earl of <HI>Carli&s;le</HI>'s Govern|ment, there was a &s;tately Church built, partly by <HI>Liberal Sub&s;criptions</HI> of divers well di&s;po&s;ed <HI>Gentlemen</HI> inhabiting the I&s;le, and partly by an A&s;|&s;e&s;sment laid upon the Inhabitants of the Port.

<P>But although there areas yet no more Towns in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> yet there are divers Villages or Pa|ri&s;hes which are well inhabited by the <HI>Engl&s;h,</HI> in every one whereof, they have very good Plantati|ons

<P>The whole I&s;land is divided in|to fourteen Pari&s;hes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Divi&s;ion and Number of Inhabitants.</NOTE> Divi&s;ions, or Precincts; which are, for the &s;a|tisfaction of the Reader, all &s;et forth in the Map, and the &s;everal Places throughout the whole I&s;land where the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> have made any Settlements, marked and di|&s;tingui&s;hed by Cyphers.</P>

<P>But be&s;ides the&s;e Inhabitants of the fourteen Precincts, there are reckoned to belong to <HI>Jamaica</HI> four thou&s;and Privateers, Sloop and Boat-men, that ply up and down about the I&s;le, who are all &s;tout, re&s;olute, fighting Men; which they have &s;ufficiently demon&s;trated in their late Exploits, and de&s;perate Attempts upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>Panama,</HI> and other Parts in the South-Seas.</P>
<P>This I&s;le abounds with many ex|cellent Commodities; as,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Product.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>S&V;GARS,</HI> which are &s;o good, that they out|&s;ell tho&s;e that are made in <HI>Barbados</HI> five &s;hillings <HI>per Cent.</HI> There are near an hundred of the&s;e Sugar-Works, which produced every year above two hundred thou&s;and weight of Sugar: The&s;e Sugar-Works are likewi&s;e continually increa&s;ing every year, and new are always going up.</P>
<P><HI>CACAO,</HI> whereof we make <HI>Chocolate,</HI> is, by rea&s;on of the natural aptne&s;s of the Ground to produce and bear it, the mo&s;t beneficial and &s;taple Commodity of the I&s;land; there being near an hundred <HI>Cacao-Walks,</HI> be&s;ides abundance of young ones newly planted and growing up, and others that are &s;till planting; &s;o that it will in time be|come the mo&s;t noted place for that Commodity in the World; which will redound to the great ad|vantage of the Planters, in regard it is &s;o much u&s;ed by us and other neighbouring Nations, e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who u&s;e &s;uch va&s;t quantities of it, they alone are enough to take off all that
<PB N="14" REF="17"> the I&s;land produces; &s;o that there is no fear that it will ever prove a Drug, and lie upon their hands.</P>
<P><HI>INDICO,</HI> which the I&s;le produces in great abundance, and very good, there being already above eighty <HI>Indico-Works,</HI> which produce above &s;ixty thou&s;and weight of <HI>Indico per annum;</HI> which <HI>Works</HI> do likewi&s;e very much increa&s;e every year.</P>
<P><HI>COTTON</HI> is another of their Products, which is very fine, and is therefore preferred by all that deal in that Commodity, before that which grows in any of the <HI>Caribby I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TOBACCO,</HI> which is here indifferent good, being accounted much better than that which grows at <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but other Commodities pro|ving more beneficial to the I&s;landers, there is not much of it planted, only what &s;erves for their own &s;pending.</P>
<P><HI>TORTOISE-SHELLS,</HI> which are in &s;o much e&s;teem with us in <HI>England</HI> for &s;everal cu|rious Works, and therefore find as ready a vent as any Commodity what&s;oever that is brought us from beyond the Seas. There are abundance of them taken on this Coa&s;t, there being a fur|ther end in the taking them, be&s;ides the Merchan|dizing of the Shells, for their Fle&s;h are excellent Meat.</P>
<P><HI>HIDES,</HI> great quantities, whereof have been yearly made there, and are found to be very large and good.</P>
<P><HI>WOODS</HI> for the u&s;e of <HI>Dyers,</HI> whereof there are great variety, as <HI>Fu&s;tick, Red-Wood,</HI> &amp;c. Here is likewi&s;e <HI>Cedar, Mathogency, Bra&s;illetto, Lignum Vitae, Ebony, Granadilla,</HI> and divers other excellent &s;weet &s;melling and curious Woods, fit for the choice&s;t Works, who&s;e Names are yet unknown,
<PB N="15" REF="17"> and &s;o indeed are their excellencies; however, great quantities of 'em are continually exported thence, and great profit made of them.</P>
<P><HI>SALT</HI> is another of the Products of this I&s;land, which might be made here in great quan|tities, there being already three very large <HI>Salt-Ponds,</HI> containing near Four thou&s;and Acres of ground, and there was made, in one Year, about Ten thou&s;and Bu&s;hels; and the manager of it, Captain <HI>John Noye,</HI> affirmed, That he could as well have made &s;o many Tun, if they had had vent for it. But, at pre&s;ent, they make little more than what is &s;pent in the I&s;land. Nor is it altoge|ther void of other Salts, there having been good quantities of <HI>Nitre</HI> found in divers places in the I&s;le.</P>
<P><HI>GINGER,</HI> grows better there, than it doth in many other of the <HI>Caribby I&s;lands,</HI> which hath occa&s;ioned the planting great quantities of it.</P>
<P><HI>COD-PEPPER</HI> likewi&s;e, which is a Spice very much u&s;ed in all the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> grows in great plenty there; and &s;o doth</P>
<P><HI>PIEMENTO,</HI> or a certain Spice which is better known by name of <HI>Jamaica-Pepper,</HI> very aromatical, and of a curious flavor, having the ex|act ta&s;te both of Cinamon and Cloves, with a complicated mixtute of divers other &s;weet and cu|rious Spices. This Spice the I&s;land doth naturally produce; for it grows wild upon the mountainous parts of it; &s;ome whereof are plantable, and others &s;o &s;tony, that are unplantable; but both are generally covered with excellent Timber and great abundancy of Fruit and Spice-trees. The <HI>Spaniards,</HI> when they enjoyed the place, &s;et a high value upon this Spice, and exported it as a very choice Commodity, as indeed it is; and the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="18"> finding &s;o good a vent for it, intend to imi|tate them therein, and begin now to bring it into their Plantations, which will in time turn them to great account.</P>
<P><HI>DR&V;GS,</HI> which this I&s;land produces in great abundance, as, <HI>Guiacum, China-roots, Sar&s;aparilla, Ca&s;&s;ia-Fi&s;tula, Tamerinds, Vinello's</HI> and <HI>Achiots</HI> or <HI>Anetto,</HI> which is like to prove a good Commodity. There are al&s;o divers &s;orts of</P>
<P><HI>G&V;MS</HI> and <HI>Roots</HI> wherewith experienced Planters cure divers Wounds, Ulcers and other Maladies; as, <HI>Aloes, Benjamin,</HI> and the like: And by the report of an intelligent <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> who made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire and &s;earch after &s;uch things, there is likewi&s;e <HI>Cyperas, Contrayerva, Adjunctum nigrum, Cucumis agre&s;tis, Sumach, Aca|cia, Mi&s;leto,</HI> with many other <HI>Drugs, Bal&s;ams</HI> and <HI>Gums,</HI> who&s;e Names and Virtues are not known or remembred. However the Planters begin every year to be better and better acquainted with their Nature and U&s;e, and endeavour to encrea&s;e them, in order to their &s;upplying <HI>England</HI> with them.</P>
<P><HI>COCHANEIL</HI> is likewi&s;e produced by a Plant that grows in this I&s;le; but the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being as yet not very well skill'd in husbanding of it, and the Ea&s;t-winds, and many other things being enemies to its growth, its product is not very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and the like Commodities are the Pro|duct of this I&s;land, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have already, and will in a little time improve to that degree, that it will quickly become the be&s;t and the rich|e&s;t Plantation that they ever were or are like to be Ma&s;ters of; e&s;pecially if they &s;hould find out the <HI>Copper Mines,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ay to be in
<PB N="17" REF="18"> this I&s;land, with &s;ome whereof they affirm the <HI>Bells</HI> that hung in the great Church at St. <HI>Jago</HI> to be ca&s;t. And the <HI>Silver Mines,</HI> which may pro|bably be here as well as in <HI>Cuba</HI> and the Main Con|tinent, &s;ince the <HI>Spaniards</HI> affirm they found one behind the Mountains, on the We&s;t of <HI>Cag|way.</HI></P>
<P>But before I pa&s;s from this Di&s;cour&s;e, of the Product of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> I &s;hall give you an account of the manner of managing a <HI>Cacao Walk,</HI> in re|gard it is the Chief Commodity of the I&s;land, with a particular calculation of the change in Planting, and the profits that ari&s;e from it, as it was lately e&s;timated by a very judicious and under&s;tanding per&s;on, and one who hath gi|ven great incouragement to divers of the <HI>Planters</HI> there.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on, who intends to &s;ettle at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> arrives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of a Cocao Walk.</NOTE> af|ter he hath taken a view of the Country, his fir&s;t work mu&s;t be to take up Six hundred Acres of Land, which mu&s;t be cho&s;en in a good place, that &s;o the Land may be proper to produce the Nut; which Grant, for the Patent and Surveying, will co&s;t Ten Pounds. Having taken up his Land, he mu&s;t provide him&s;elf of three <HI>Negro</HI> Men, and as many Women; which, at Twenty Pounds <HI>per</HI> head, will come to an Hundred and twenty Pounds; with four White Servants, which, with their Pa&s;&s;age and Diet for a Year, will co&s;t him about Eighty Pounds; with Twenty Axes, and the like number of Bills and Hoes, which will co&s;t him about Five Pounds; and with an Over&s;eer, to look after his Servants and keep them to their work, who&s;e Wages and Diet, at Forty Shillings a Month, will co&s;t him Twenty
<PB N="18" REF="19"> four Pounds: All which, with Eighteen Pounds, which the Provi&s;ions for his Six <HI>Negro</HI> Servants, will, at Four Pence <HI>per</HI> day, each of them co&s;t him for the fir&s;t &s;ix Months, till his own Plantation is capable of maintaining them, is Two hundred fifty &s;even Pounds, Five Shillings.</P>
<P>When this is done, his next bu&s;ine&s;s is to &s;et his Servants to work, who&s;e fir&s;t imployment mu&s;t be to cut down the Wood, and clear a convenient place, whereon to build fitting Hou&s;es for their Lodging; which, if they begin with <HI>March,</HI> they will have effected by the middle of that Month: After which, he mu&s;t &s;et them to felling the Tim|ber, grubbing up the Roots, and clearing a piece of Ground, of four Acres, whereon to plant <HI>Po|tatoes;</HI> all which planting, and all, with the help of his Servants, will be ea&s;ily effected by the middle of <HI>April.</HI> And then his be&s;t way is to &s;et them to prepare more Ground, which he may plant with <HI>Plantane</HI>-Trees, and other things, (which he thinks he &s;hall fir&s;t want, for the enabling his Plantation to &s;ub&s;i&s;t of its &s;elf) till the begin|ning of <HI>February,</HI> which compleats the Year. In which time they may, with ea&s;e, prepare and plant about one or two and twenty Acres, and the Plantation will be able to live of its &s;elf, for they will now be full of <HI>Potatoes</HI> and <HI>Corn,</HI> and within two Months of the new Year with <HI>Plan|tanes,</HI> which, together with his &s;tock of Hoggs and Fowls will &s;ufficiently furni&s;h him with Provi|&s;ions for his Servants.</P>
<P>To improve this Ground, and plant the <HI>Cacao-Walk,</HI> he mu&s;t, about the beginning of the next <HI>March,</HI> provide him&s;elf with five <HI>Negro</HI> men more, and as many Women, which will come to Two hundred pounds more: And that Month he mu&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="19"> imploy all the hands he has in planting <HI>Cacao</HI>-Trees between all the Rows of <HI>Plantanes,</HI> which, by this time are grown to be &s;ix foot high, and, by the be|ginning of <HI>June,</HI> he will have, be&s;ides much other work done, the whole twenty one Acres, which were planted the year before with <HI>Cacao</HI>-Trees, which, in le&s;s than four years, will begin to bear Cods, and, in five years, produce compleat Crops, each Acre affording yearly to the Planter a Thou|&s;and Weight of <HI>Cacao</HI>-Nuts, which is there worth about four Pounds <HI>per cent.</HI> &s;o that the twenty one Acres, which are already planted and come to per|fection, are worth Eight hundred and forty Pounds <HI>per Annum.</HI> And the whole Expence, together with Forty two Pounds fifteen Shillings more, al|lowed for gathering and hou&s;ing them, amounts but to Five hundred Pounds, &s;o that the profit will be very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>All the Work, already mentioned, will be per|formed in fifteen Months, and the remaining time, till the <HI>Cacaoes</HI> come to perfection, which will be &s;omewhat better than four year, he may imploy in increa&s;ing the Walk, building convenient Hou&s;es, and making of Gardens for plea&s;ure: Or, if the &s;malne&s;s of his Stock will not permit him to for|bear his Money till the <HI>Cacaoes</HI> come to bear com|pleatly, he may fall to planting <HI>Ginger, Indico,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch kind of Commodity for pre&s;ent profit.</P>
<P>And according to this Calculation the plant|ing of a &s;maller or a larger Walk may be ef|fected.</P>
<P>There is in this I&s;land a greater plenty of Cattel<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cattel.</NOTE> than in mo&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations in <HI>America.</HI> Hor&s;es &s;o much abound there, that one of the bet|ter

Their <HI>Sheep</HI> are likewi&s;e very large and tall, the Fle&s;h whereof is very good, but the Wool long, hairy, and little worth. They have great plenty of <HI>Goats,</HI> which thrive and increa&s;e there exceed|ingly, the Country being found very fit for them. <HI>Hoggs</HI> they have likewi&s;e in exceeding great plenty, as well wild in the Mountains, as tame in the Plan|tations; the Fle&s;h whereof is far better ta&s;ted, more nouri&s;hing, and much ea&s;ier to be dige&s;ted, than tho&s;e of <HI>Europe;</HI> which is the rea&s;on why it is &s;o much eaten in this, and indeed in all the other I&s;lands throughout all the <HI>West Indies.</HI> They have al&s;o plenty of <HI>Rabbits,</HI> but no <HI>Hare</HI> nor <HI>Deer</HI> in all the I&s;land.</P>

<P>There is on the Sea-&s;ide a Salt-Pit, called <HI>Gul|de&s;ac;</HI> and not far from the Salt-Pit there is a &s;mall <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of Land, which reacheth within a Mile and a half of the I&s;land of <HI>Nevis</HI> and <HI>Mevis.</HI></P>
<P>The I&s;land is placed exceeding delightful, and of a mo&s;t delectable pro&s;pect to the eye of the be|holder, for it is divided into &s;everal &s;tages, from the uppermo&s;t whereof a man may take an exceed|ing plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of all the Plantations and Gardens, which gently de&s;cend to the Sea-&s;ide, and in regard of the general a&s;cent of the I&s;le, the lower &s;tage or &s;tory doth not debar the eye of the plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of that which lieth at a remoter di&s;tance; and that which makes the pro|&s;pect the more delectable in the &s;everal Planta|tious (which are bounded with Rows of Trees al|ways in their verdure) are the fair Hou&s;es covered with glazed Slate.</P>
<P>The whole I&s;land is divided into four Quarters or Cantons; two whereof are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and two by the <HI>French,</HI> but &s;o &s;eparated, that People cannot go from one Quarter to an|other without pa&s;&s;ing over the Lands of one of the two Nations. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have more little Rivers in their Divi&s;ion, the <HI>French</HI> more of the plain Countrey fit for Tillage. The <HI>Engil&s;h</HI> ex|ceed the <HI>French</HI> in number, but the <HI>French</HI> have four Forts; of which, one hath regular Works like a Citadel; that of mo&s;t note commands the Haven, and is called <HI>Ba&s;&s;e-Terre;</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> only two, one commanding the great Haven, and the other a De&s;cent not far from <HI>Pointe de Sable;</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="34"> and to prevent Differences between the two Nati|ons, each of them have a Guard upon the Fronti|ers of their Divi&s;ion, which is renewed every day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have erected five fair Churches, well furni&s;hed with Pulpits, and Seats of excellent Joyners Work of precious Wood, the Mini&s;ters being &s;ent thither by the Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Can|terbury;</HI> one of the Churches is at <HI>Sandy-Point,</HI> one at <HI>Palm-Tree,</HI> another near the <HI>Great Rood,</HI> and two at the Inlet of <HI>Cayoune,</HI> with many fair Stru|ctures.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies had their be|ginning at the &s;ame time; for in the Year 1625.

<P>The&s;e two Gentlemen, having thus taken po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land, for the better e&s;tabli&s;hment of the&s;e Colonies, returned to their re&s;pective Countries, leaving &s;ome men in it to &s;ecure it; but &s;u&s;pecting &s;ome private Intelligence between the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for de&s;troying all, both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> in their ab&s;ence, (to prevent which) they in one night rid their Hands of the mo&s;t factious of that Nation, and &s;oon after for|ced all the re&s;t, who were got together in &s;everal Bodies, and &s;tood upon their Guard, to retire to

They are &s;o extraordinary tame, that they will come at Dinner time upon the very Table, and endeavour to catch Flies upon their Hands or Clothes, being extraordinary neat and clean things: the Eggs they lay are as big as Pea&s;e, which they leave to be hatched by the Sun, covering of it fir&s;t with Sand: they are no &s;ooner killed, but all their beauty vani&s;heth, and they become pale. It may be counted a &s;ort of <HI>Camelion,</HI> partaking of the colour of tho&s;e things on which it makes its ordinary re&s;idence, for being about Palm-Trees, it is green, and about Orange-Trees, yellow, and the like.</P>
<P>The <HI>Palm-Worm</HI> is remarkable from its infinite number of Feet, which are like Bri&s;tles under his Body, which, if pur&s;ued, help him to creep with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s. It's half a foot long, the upper part covered with &s;warthy Scales, which are hard, and joynted one within another, like the Tiles of a Hou&s;e; but the mo&s;t danger in this Creature is, that he hath a kind of Claw, both in Head and Tail, wherewith he pierces &s;o home, and poy&s;ons the wound he makes therewith, that for the &s;pace of 24 hours the party feels great pain.</P>
<P>There was &s;everal years &s;ince brought from thence a Bird about the bigne&s;s and &s;hape of a Swallow, only two large Feathers on the Tail, a little &s;horter, and the Beak turned down,
<PB N="60" REF="41"> like a Parrot, and its Feet like Ducks; its only black under the Belly, &s;omething white, like our Swallows; in &s;hort, it is &s;o very like them, that it may be called the Swallow of <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>THE I&s;land of St. <HI>Vincent</HI> lies in the latitude of 16 degrees North from the Line, and is about 24 Miles in length, and 18 in breadth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> wherein are &s;everal high Mountains, having between them exceeding fruitful Plains, yielding good &s;tore of Sugar Canes, which grow naturally without plan|ting: It is well water'd with Rivers, and hath &s;e|veral convenient Harbours and Bays for Shipping. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have here &s;ome &s;ettlement, but are not very powerful, it being more populous of <HI>Caribeans,</HI> than of any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by them, who have here many fair Villages, where they dwell exceeding plea&s;ant, without the lea&s;t di&s;turbance; and though they are jealous of tho&s;e Strangers that live near them, and keep Guard when they come upon their Roads, yet they do not deny <HI>Ca&s;&s;avy</HI> Bread, Water, Fruits, and other Provi|&s;ions growing in their Country, to them that want them, taking in exchange Wedges, Hooks, and other Implements of Iron, which they much e&s;teem. Their &s;implicity is very remarkable in &s;everal things, as in admiring our Fire-Arms, but
<PB N="66" REF="44"> e&s;pecially Fire-Locks, to which they &s;ee no fire put, as to Muskets, and therefore believe <HI>Maboya,</HI> or the Devil, &s;ets them on fire; they believe when the Moon is Eclip&s;ed, the Devil eats her; they daunce all night, making a noi&s;e with Gourds, wherein are many pebble &s;tones; when they &s;mell any evil &s;cent, they cry, <HI>Maboya,</HI> or the Devil, <HI>is here, let us be gone from him.</HI></P>
<P>Some time &s;ince, mo&s;t of the <HI>Caribeans</HI> were per|&s;waded, that Gun-powder was the Seed of &s;ome Hearb, in&s;omuch that &s;ome of them &s;owed it in their Gardens. They never make u&s;e of Salt, ac|counting it very prejudicial to health, and when they &s;ee Chri&s;tians u&s;e it, cry, <HI>Compere, thou ha&s;tneth thy own death;</HI> but in&s;tead thereof, they &s;ea&s;on all things with <HI>American</HI> Pepper: Neither do they eat Swines-fle&s;h, for this &s;imple rea&s;on, lea&s;t they &s;hould have &s;mall Eyes like that Bea&s;t, which they judge the greate&s;t deformity; nor Tortoi&s;e or Turtle, le&s;t they &s;hould participate of its lazine&s;s and &s;tupidity.

If any di&s;cour&s;e to them about God, and the My&s;teries of our Religion, they hearken attentively, but in the end, an&s;wer as it were in je&s;t, <HI>Friend, thou art very eloquent and &s;ubtile, I wi&s;h I could talk as well as thee.</HI> Nay, they &s;ometimes &s;ay, That if they &s;hould be per&s;waded by &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, their Neighbours would laugh at them.

<P>They have a natural &s;entiment of &s;ome Divinity or Superior Power, that hath its Re&s;idence in Hea|ven, which they &s;ay is content to enjoy quietly the delights of his own felicity, without being offen|ded at the ill actions of Men; and is endued with &s;o great goodne&s;s, as not to take any Revenge, even of his Enemies, from whence they render Heaven neither Honour nor Adoration, interpre|ting its liberality and long-&s;ufferance, an effect either of its weakne&s;s or indifference towards Man|kind, believing that there are a number of Good and Evil Spirits, the Good being their Gods, and every one imagines he has one particularly de&s;ign'd for his Conduct, yet will not acknowledge them Creators of the World: And when the Chri&s;tians tell them, we adore that God who made Heaven and Earth, and cau&s;eth the Earth to bring forth Fruits and Herbs for our nouri&s;hment; they an|&s;wer, It is true, thy God hath made the Heaven and Earth, of <HI>France,</HI> (or &s;ome other Country which they name) and cau&s;es the Wheat to grow there; but our God has made our Country, and cau&s;es our Manioc to grow.

To Demand Revenge. 2. To be Healed of Di&s;ea&s;es. 3. To know the Event of their Wars. 4. To invocate them to carry away their Great Devil, or <HI>Maboya,</HI> for they never pray to him: His Invocation is by Singing &s;ome words, and burning Tobacco, the &s;cent whereof is &s;o plea&s;ant, that it makes this little Devil appear. And when their &s;everal Prie&s;ts call upon their &s;everal Gods together, as they &s;peak, the&s;e Gods, or rather Devils, rail, quarrel, and &s;eem to fight with each other. The&s;e Daemons &s;helter them&s;elves &s;ometimes in the Bones of dead Men, taken out of the Graves, and wrapt in Cot|ton, and thereby give Oracles, &s;aying, it is the Soul of the decea&s;ed Per&s;on; they make u&s;e of them to bewitch their Enemies, the Sorcerers wrapping up the&s;e Bones with &s;omething that be|longs to the Enemy.</P>

<P>The Great Soul of our <HI>Arovagues</HI> was not only in his Lips, but likewi&s;e &s;hewed it al&s;o in the effects which follow his Bravado; for after the Company had a while endured his arrogant defiance with|out

After they had thus &s;ported a long time with the poor wretch, and growing weary of in&s;ulting and out-braving by his con&s;tancy, which &s;eemed &s;till the &s;ame, one of them came, and with one blow di&s;patch'd him with his Club.

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE I&s;land of <HI>DOMINICA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>Dominica</HI> is &s;ituated in the Latitude of 15 Degrees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Situa|tion.</NOTE> 30 Mi|nutes, and about 12 Leagues in length, and 8 in breadth. On the We&s;t-&s;ide is a very con|venient Harbour for Ships. It is very mountainous in the mid&s;t, which incompa&s;&s;es an inacce&s;&s;able bottom, where, from the tops of certain Rocks, may be &s;een an infinite number of Dragons, Vi|pers, and other mo&s;t venomous and dreadful creatures, whom none dares come near, yet there are many Fertile Villages, producing &s;everal Com|modities, but chiefly Tobacco, which is planted by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> but the Natives, which are <HI>Cani|bals,</HI> and very barbarous, doth much hinder the coming of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to &s;ettle there; for the <HI>Can|ribeans</HI> are very populous in it, and have a long time entertained tho&s;e who come to vi&s;it them with a &s;tory of a va&s;t mon&s;trous Serpent that fre|quented that bottom; affirming, that there was on its Head a very &s;parkling Stone, like a Car|buncle of ine&s;timable price, which it commonly
<PB N="74" REF="48"> covered with a thin moving skin, like a Mans eye|lid, but when he drank or &s;ported him&s;elf in that deep bottom, it was fully and plainly di&s;covered, the Rocks and all about the place receiving a won|derful lu&s;tre from the fire, i&s;&s;uing out of that pre|cious Crown.</P>
<P>They are generally very friendly with the <HI>French,</HI> and upon the approach of any of their Ships, &s;everal <HI>Canoes,</HI> with three or four <HI>Indians</HI> in each of them, immediately meet them and con|duct them to the Havens, where they may &s;afely Anchor. And having pre&s;ented the Captain and others Officers with the choice&s;t of tho&s;e Country-Fruits, they commonly bring them, they offer the re&s;t in exchange, for Fi&s;hing-hooks, and other &s;uch kind of trifles, which they account precious. But to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> they have a great aver&s;ion, concei|ved, as is reported, upon this occa&s;ion: Some evil-minded <HI>Engli&s;h-men,</HI> under the Flags of other Na|tions, having, by pretended kindne&s;s and little gifts, gotten divers of them on board their Ships, and made them merry with <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> and <HI>Brandy,</HI> which they love extreamly, they &s;uddenly hoi&s;ted up &s;ail, and carried away tho&s;e poor, innocent People, who expected no &s;uch Treachery, from &s;uch pretended Friends. And although the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have indeavoured to &s;atisfie them, yet &s;o impla|cable is their temper, that they can't be per&s;waded to forget or forgive the injury; but, next to the <HI>Arovagues,</HI> a People on the Continent, they hate the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as their wor&s;t Enemies: and to &s;uch an height of envy hath this Action exa&s;perated them, that they hate the very Language, and can't indure to hear it &s;poken, and if a <HI>French man,</HI> or any other at peace with them, happen, through for|getfulne&s;s, to make u&s;e of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Expre&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="75" REF="48"> in di&s;cour&s;ing with them, he runs the hazard of contracting his envy for ever upon him&s;elf. Nor do they fail, when they find opportunity, to make incur&s;ions into <HI>Mont&s;errat, Antego,</HI> and other of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements, plundering and burning down their Hou&s;es, and carrying away &s;uch Men, Wo|men and Children as they can get into their hands by &s;urpri&s;e, but do not eat them as they do the <HI>Arovagues.</HI></P>
<P>They can't indure to be called <HI>Cannibals:</HI> they do eat the fle&s;h of their enemies, which they &s;ay is to gratifie their revenge, and not out of any delicacy they find in the meat. They are for the mo&s;t part of a good tractable di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;uch enemies to &s;everity, that tho&s;e of them that fall into the hands of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or any other Nation, if their Ma&s;ters treat them with rigour, they die out of pure grief. They de&s;pi&s;e Riches, and often reproach the <HI>Euro|peans</HI> for their avarice and exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of Wealth, not only for them&s;elves, but tho&s;e that come after them too, &s;ince the Earth will find a &s;ufficiency for all men, who will take pains to manure it; telling them, that they never per|plex and torture them&s;elves with cares for tho&s;e things whereby their Lives are pre&s;erved; and yet, for any thing they can &s;ee to the contrary, they are fatter in fle&s;h and much happier in the whole cour&s;e of their Lives, than tho&s;e that do always eat and drink of the be&s;t. And, to &s;ay the truth, they are a People that live without ambi|tion, vexation, or di&s;quieting them&s;elves with a fruitle&s;s thoughtfulne&s;s about future Events; ha|ving no de&s;ire of acquiring Wealth and Honour, &s;lighting Gold and Silver as things not worth the valuing, prote&s;ting they can't but wonder we

When they &s;ee any of the Chri&s;tians are perplex'd, they cry, <HI>Compeer,</HI> which &s;ignifies Friend or Go&s;&s;ip, <HI>How mi&s;erable dost thou make thy Life, by expo&s;ing thy &s;elf to &s;uch long and dangerous Voyages, oppre&s;&s;ing thy &s;elf with cares and the inordinate de&s;ire of getting Wealth, which puts thee to all this trouble, and is the occa&s;ion of the va|rious inconveniencies thou every day meetest withal, from which we are wholly free. And that which yet &s;eems to me much &s;tranger, is, your being no le&s;s di&s;|quieted about the Goods you have already gotten, than you are about tho&s;e you de&s;ire to obtain. Thou art al|ways in fear lest &s;omebody &s;hould rob thee by Land or by Sea, or that thy Goods &s;hould &s;uffer Shipwreck, or thou &s;houldest &s;uffer dammage by their coming too late for the Market. And by this means thou growest old before thy time, thy Hair turns grey, thy Body waxes lean thy Forehead wrinkled, a thou&s;and in|conveniencies attend thy Per&s;on, and as many afflictions &s;urround thy Heart, and hurries thee with the greater &s;peed to thy Grave. What a &s;trange thing 'tis, that thou canst not content thy &s;elf with what thy own Countrey produces, and contemn Riches, as thou &s;eest us do. Or tell me, Doth that Wealth which you Chri|&s;tians pur&s;ue with &s;o much eagerne&s;s, tend to your advancement in holine&s;s? doth it prevent your dying, or can you carry any of it into that Eternity you &s;ome|times talk of.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes they will upbraid the <HI>Europeans</HI> with manife&s;t inju&s;tice, in invading their Country; <HI>Ha|ving driven us from</HI> Mevis, Mont&s;errat, Antego, <HI>&amp;c. none of all which did by any pretence of right belong to you, and threatning &s;till to take away what is left;

<P>They are great enemies to thieving, and live without di&s;tru&s;t of each other, frequently lea|ving their Hou&s;es and Plantations without any to look to them; but if they chance to lo&s;e any thing, though but a little Knife, they will weep and grieve a Week after; and if any Chri&s;tians live near, they pre&s;ently &s;u&s;pect them, and &s;ay, <HI>Some Chri&s;tian hath been here.</HI> And in their Com|plaints to any of the <HI>French</HI> Governours, this is commonly the fir&s;t: <HI>Thy Mariners</HI> (for &s;o they call all &s;trangers) <HI>have taken away a Knife</HI> (or &s;ome &s;uch &s;mall trifle) <HI>out of my Cottage.</HI></P>
<P>They are a People linked in one common intre&s;t, and love each other extreamly, &s;o that very rarely any difference ari&s;eth among&s;t them; but if they are by chance offended, though it be by one of their own People, they &s;eldom ever forget it, but &s;tudy all imaginable ways of revenge, and when their Sorcerers tell them &s;uch an one hath done them the Mi&s;chief that happens to them, they watch all opportunities to kill him, crying out, <HI>He hath bewitched me, I will be revenged on him.</HI></P>
<P>They bear great re&s;pect to ancient people, the younger &s;ort complying in all things with their &s;entiments and wills. Their Youths have no conver&s;ation either with their Maids or married Women, and are generally le&s;s amorous than tho&s;e of the Female Sex, though both are very cha&s;t, a Vertue worthy admiration in a barbarous People that go naked. But, by the pernicious
<PB N="78" REF="50"> Examples the Chri&s;tians have &s;et them, they are now grown &s;omewhat more loo&s;e.

<P>The conveniency of Situation, temperature of Air, and fertility of Soyl is &s;uch, that there is no le&s;s then &s;even con&s;iderable Towns, <HI>viz.

<P>The De&s;cription of the Province cannot bet|ter be given by any than by <HI>William Penn</HI> him|&s;elf, who &s;ent the following Account from off the place, in a Letter dated from <HI>Philadelphia, Aug.</HI> 16. 1683.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>For this Province, the general Condition of it take as followeth:</HEAD>
<P>THE Country it&s;elf in its Soil, Air, Water, Sea&s;ons, and Product, both Natural and Ar|tificial, is not to be de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Land contains divers &s;orts of Earth; as Sand, yellow and black,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Soil.</NOTE> poor and rich: Al&s;o Gravel, both loomy and du&s;ty; and in &s;ome places a fa&s;t, fat Earth, like to our be&s;t Vales in <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially by Inland-Brooks and Rivers; God, in his wi&s;dom, hath ordered it &s;o, that the Advantages of the Country are divided, the Back-Lands being gene|rally three to one richer than tho&s;e that lye by Navigable Waters; we have much of another Soil, and that is a black, Ha&s;le-Mould, upon a &s;tony or rocky bottom.</P>
<P>The Air<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Air.</NOTE> is &s;weet and cleer, the Heavens &s;erene, like the South-Parts of <HI>France,</HI> rarely over-ca&s;t, and as the Woods come by numbers of people to be more cleared, that it&s;elf will refine.</P>
<P>The Waters<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Waters.</NOTE> are generally good, for the Rivers and Brooks have mo&s;tly gravel and &s;tony bottoms, and in number hardly credible. We have al&s;o Mineral Waters, that operate in the &s;ame manner with <HI>Bar|net</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="57"> and <HI>North-hall,</HI> not two Miles from <HI>Philadel|phia.</HI></P>
<P>For the Sea&s;ons of the Year, ha|ving,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Climate.</NOTE> by God's goodne&s;s, now lived over the colde&s;t and hotte&s;t, that the olde&s;t liver in the Province can remember, I can &s;ay &s;omething to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> under&s;tanding. Fir&s;t, Of the Fall, for then I came in: I found it from the 24^t^h of <HI>October,</HI> to the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> as we have it u&s;ually in <HI>September,</HI> or rather like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mild Spring. From <HI>December,</HI> to the beginning of the Month called <HI>March,</HI> we had &s;harp, fro&s;ty weather; not foul, thick, black weather, as our North-Ea&s;t Winds bring with them in <HI>England,</HI> but a Sky as clear as in Summer, and the Air dry, cold, piercing, and hungry; yet I remember not, that I wore more Clothes than in <HI>England.</HI> The rea&s;on of this cold is given from the great Lakes that are fed by the Fountains of <HI>Canada.</HI> The Winter before was as mild, &s;carce any Ice at all; while this for a few days froze up our great River <HI>Delaware.</HI> From that Month, to the Month called <HI>June,</HI> we enjoyed a &s;weet Spring, no Gu&s;ts, but gentle Showers and a fine Sky. Yet this I ob&s;erve, that the Winds here, as there, are mo&s;t incon&s;tant Spring and Fall, upon that turn of Nature, than in Summer or Winter. From thence, to this pre&s;ent Month, which ended the Summer, (commonly &s;peaking) we have had extraordinary heats, yet mitigated &s;ometimes by cold Breezes. The Wind that rules the Summer-&s;ea&s;on, is the South-We&s;t; but Spring, Fall, and Winter, 'tis rare to want the whole&s;om North-We&s;tern &s;even days together; and whatever Mi&s;ts, Fogs, or Va|pours, foul the Heavens by Ea&s;terly or Southerly Winds, in two hours time are blown away; the
<PB N="93" REF="57"> one is always followed by the other. A Remedy that &s;eems to be a peculiar Providence in it to the Inhabitants; the multitude of Trees yet &s;tanding, being liable to retain Mi&s;ts and Va|pours, and yet not one quarter &s;o thick as I ex|pected.</P>
<P>The natural product of the Coun|try of <HI>Vegetables,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Vegetables.</NOTE> is Trees, Fruits, Plants, Flowers; the Trees of mo&s;t Note, are, the Black Walnut, Cedar, Cyprus, Che&s;nut, Poplar, Gum-wood, Hickery, Sa&s;&s;afras, A&s;h, Beech, and Oak of divers &s;orts, as Red, White and Black; <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Che&s;nut and Swamp, the mo&s;t durable of all; of all which there is plen|ty for u&s;e of Man.</P>
<P>The Fruits<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruits.</NOTE> that I find in the Woods, are, the white and black Mulberry, Che&s;|nuts, Walnut, Plums, Strawberries, Cranberries, Hurtleberries, and Grapes of divers &s;orts, the great red Grape, (now Ripe) called by ignorance, the <HI>Fox</HI>-Grape (becau&s;e of the reli&s;h it hath with unskilful palates) is in it &s;elf an ex|traordinary Grape, and by art doubtle&s;s may be cultivated to an excellent Wine, if not &s;o &s;weet, yet little inferiour to the <HI>Frontiniack,</HI> as it is not much unlike in ta&s;te, ruddine&s;s &s;et a&s;ide, which in &s;uch things, as well as Mankind, differs the ca&s;e much. There is a white kind of Muskadel, and a little black Grape, like the clu&s;ter of Grapes in <HI>England,</HI> not yet &s;o ripe as the other, but they tell me when ripe, &s;weeter, and that they only want skilful <HI>Vinerons</HI> to make good u&s;e of them; <HI>I in|tend to venture on it with my</HI> French-<HI>Man this Sea&s;on, who &s;hews &s;ome knowledge in tho&s;e things.</HI></P>
<P>Here are al&s;o Peaches, very good, and in great quantities, not an <HI>Indian</HI> Plantation without them;
<PB N="94" REF="58"> but whether naturally here at fir&s;t, I know not, however one may have them by Bu&s;hels for little; they make a plea&s;ant Drink, and I think not infe|riour to any Peach you have in <HI>England,</HI> except the true <HI>Newington.</HI> 'Tis di&s;putable with me, whether it be be&s;t to fall to Fining the Fruits of the Country, e&s;pecially the Grapes, by the care and skill of Art, or &s;end for Forreign Stems and Sets already good and approved; it &s;eems mo&s;t rea&s;onable to believe, that not only a thing grow|eth be&s;t, where it naturally grows; but will hard|ly be equall'd by another's Species of the &s;ame kind, that doth not naturally grow there. But to re&s;olve this doubt, I intend (if God give me life) to try both, and hope the Con&s;equences will be as good Wine as any <HI>European</HI> Countries of the &s;ame Latitude do yield.</P>
<P>The artificial Product<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Product.</NOTE> of the Coun|try, is Wheat, Barley, Oats, Rye, Pea&s;e, Beans, Squa&s;hes, Pumkins, Water-Melons, Musk-Melons, and all Herbs and Roots that our Gardens in <HI>England</HI> u&s;ually bring forth.</P>
<P>Of Living Creatures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Living Crea|tures.</NOTE> as Fi&s;h, Fowl, and the Bea&s;t of the Woods, here are divers &s;orts, &s;ome for Food and Profit, and &s;ome for Pro|fit only; for food as well as profit, the Elk, as big as a &s;mall Ox, Deer bigger than ours, Bea|ver, Racoon, Rabbits, Squirrils, and &s;ome eat young Bear, and commend it. Of Fowls of the Land, there is the Turkey, (forty or fifty pound weight) which is very great; Phea&s;ants, Heath-Birds, Pidgeons, and Patridges in abundance: Of the Water, the Swan, Goo&s;e, white and gray, Ducks, Teal, al&s;o the Snipe and Curloe, and
<PB N="95" REF="58"> that in great numbers; but the Duck and Teal excel, nor &s;o good have I ever eat in other Coun|tries. Of Fi&s;h, there is the Sturgeon, Herring, Rock, Shad, Cat&s;head, Eel, Smelt, Pearch, Roch; and in Inland Rivers, Trout, &s;ome &s;ay Salmon, above the Falls. Of Shell-fi&s;h, we have Oy&s;ters, Crabs, Cockles, Concks, Mu&s;eta's; &s;ome Oy&s;ters &s;ix Inches long,; and one &s;ort of Cockles, as big as the &s;tewing Oy&s;ter; they make a rich Broth. The Creatures for profit only, by Skin or Furr, and that are natural to tho&s;e Parts, are the Wild-Cat, Panther, Otter, Wolf, Fox, Fi&s;her, Minx, Musk-Rat: And of the Water, the Whale for Oyl, of which we have good &s;tore; and two com|panies of Whalers, who&s;e Boats are built, will &s;oon begin their work, which hath the appearance of a con&s;iderable improvement to nothing of our rea&s;onable hopes, of good Cod in the Bay. We have no want of Hor&s;es, and &s;ome are very good, &amp; &s;hapely enough; two Ships have been fraighted to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with Hor&s;es and Pipe-&s;taves, &s;ince my coming in; here is al&s;o plenty of Cow-Cattel, and &s;ome Sheep; the People Plow mo&s;tly with Oxen.</P>
<P>There are divers Plants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plants.</NOTE> that not only the <HI>Indians</HI> tell us, but we have had occa&s;ion to prove, by Swellings, Burns, Cuts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> that they are of great virtue, &s;uddenly curing the Patient; and for &s;mell, I have ob&s;erved &s;everal, e&s;pecially one, the wild Mirtle; the other I know not what to call, but are mo&s;t fragrant; the Woods are adorned with love|ly Flowers, for colour, greatne&s;s, figure and va|riety; I have &s;een the Gardens of <HI>London</HI> be&s;t &s;to|red with that &s;ort of beauty, but think they may be improved by our Woods; I have &s;ent a few to a Per&s;on of Quality this year for a Tryal. Thus

<P>Of their <HI>Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Manners</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cu&s;toms <HI>and</HI> Manners.</NOTE> there is much to be &s;aid. I will begin with <HI>Children:</HI> So &s;oon as they are born, they wa&s;h them in Water; and while very young, and in cold Wea|ther to chu&s;e, they plunge them in the Rivers to harden and embolden them: Having wrapt them in a Clout, they lay them on a &s;trait thin Board, a little more than the length &amp; breadth of the Child, and &s;waddle it fa&s;t upon the Board, to make it &s;treight; wherefore all <HI>Indians</HI> have flat Heads; and thus they carry them at their Backs. The Children will go very young, at nine Months com|monly; they wear only a &s;mall Clout round their Wai&s;t till they are big; if Boys, they go a Fi&s;hing till ripe for the Woods, which is about fifteen; then they Hunt, and having given &s;ome proofs of their Manhood, by a good return of Skins, they may Marry, el&s;e it is &s;hame to think of a Wife. The Girls &s;tay with their Mothers, and help to Hoe the Ground, Plant Corn, and carry Burthens; and they do well to u&s;e them to that Young, which they mu&s;t do when they are Old; for the Wives are the true Servants of their Husbands; other|wi&s;e the Men are very affectionate to them. When the young Women are fit for Marriage, they wear &s;omething upon their Heads for an Adverti&s;ement,
<PB N="98" REF="60"> but &s;o as their Faces are hardly to be &s;een, but when they plea&s;e: The Age they Marry at, if Women, is about thirteen and fourteen; if Men, &s;eventeen and eighteen; they are rarely elder: their Hou&s;es are Mats, or Barks of Trees, &s;et on Poles, in the fa&s;hion of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Barn, but out of the power of the Winds, for they are hardly higher than a man; they lie on Reeds or Gra&s;s. In travel they lodge in the Woods about a great fire, with the Mantle-Duffils they wear by day, wrapt about them, and a few Boughs &s;tuck round them. Their Diet is <HI>Maiz</HI> or <HI>Indian-Corn,</HI> divers ways prepa|pared; &s;ometimes roa&s;ted in the A&s;hes, &s;ometimes beaten and boiled with Water, which they call <HI>Homine;</HI> they al&s;o make Cakes, not unplea&s;ant to eat; they have likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of <HI>Beans</HI> and <HI>Pea&s;e,</HI> that are good nouri&s;hment; and the Woods and Rivers are their Larder.</P>
<P>If an <HI>European</HI> comes to &s;ee them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Enter|ment.</NOTE> or calls for Lodging at their Hou&s;e or <HI>Wigwam,</HI> they give him the be&s;t place and fir&s;t cut.

Some of the young Women are &s;aid to take undue li|berty before Marriage for a Portion; but when Married, cha&s;te: when with Child, they know their Husbands no more, till delivered; and, during their Month, they touch no Meat they eat, but with a &s;tick, le&s;t they &s;hould defile it; nor do their Husbands frequent them, till that time be expired.</P>

Some Kings have &s;old, others pre|&s;ented me with &s;everal Parcels of Land; the Pay or Pre&s;ent I made them, were not hoarded by the particular owners, but the neighbouring Kings and their Clans being pre&s;ent when the Goods were brought out, the parties chiefly concerned con&s;ulted, what and to whom they &s;hould give them; to every King then, by the hands of a per|&s;on

Their Wor|&s;hip con&s;i&s;ts of two parts, Sacrifice and Cantico: Their Sacrifice is their fir&s;t Fruits, the fir&s;t and fatte&s;t Buck they kill, goes to the Fire, where he is all burnt with a mournful Ditty of him that performs the Ceremony, but with &s;uch marvellous fervency and labour of Body, that he will even &s;weat to a Foam; the other part of their Cantico, is performed by round Dances, &s;ometimes Words, &s;ometimes Songs, then Shouts; two being in the middle that begin, and by &s;inging and drumming on a Board, direct the Chorus; their Po&s;tures in the Dance are very antick and differing, but all keep mea&s;ure. This is done with equal earne&s;t|ne&s;s and labour, but great appearance of Joy. In the Fall, when the Corn comes in, they begin to fea&s;t one another; there have been two great Fe|&s;tivals already, to which all come that will: I was at one my &s;elf; their entertainment was a great Seat by a Spring, under &s;ome &s;hady Trees, and twenty Bucks, with hot Cakes of new Corn, both Wheat and Beans, which they make up in a &s;quare form, in the Leaves of the Stem, and bake them

<P>Their Government<NOTE PLACE="marg">Government.</NOTE> is by Kings which they call <HI>Sachema,</HI> and tho&s;e by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but always of the Mothers-&s;ide; for in&s;tance, the Children of him that is now King, will not &s;ucceed, but his Bro|ther by the Mother, or the Children of his Si&s;ter, who&s;e Sons (and after them the Children of her Daughters) will reign; for no Woman inherits: the Rea&s;on they render for this way of De&s;cent, is, that their I&s;&s;ue may not be &s;purious. Every King hath his Council, and that con&s;i&s;ts of all the old and wi&s;e men of his Nation, which perhaps is two hundred People: Nothing of moment is un|dertaken, be it War, Peace, &s;elling of Land, Traffick, without advi&s;ing with them; and which is more, with the young men too. 'Tis admirable to con&s;ider how powerful the Kings are, and how they move by the Breath of the People. I have had occa&s;ion to be in Council with them upon Treaties of Land, and to adju&s;t the Terms of Trade: Their Order is thus; The King &s;its in the middle of a half-Moon, and hath his Council, the old and wi&s;e on each hand; behind them, or at a little di&s;tance, &s;it the younger Fry in the &s;ame Figure; having con&s;ulted and re&s;olved their Bu&s;i|&s;ine&s;s, the King ordered one of them to &s;peak to me, and he in the Name of his King &s;aluted me; then took me by the hand, and told me, That he was ordered by his King to &s;peak to me; and that now it was not he, but the King that &s;poke; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="103" REF="62"> what he &s;hould &s;ay, was the King's Mind. He fir&s;t prayed me to excu&s;e them that they had not complied with me the la&s;t time, he feared there might be &s;ome fault in the Interpreter, being nei|ther <HI>Indian</HI> nor <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> be&s;ides it was the <HI>Indian</HI> cu&s;tom to deliberate, and take up much time in Council before they re&s;olve; and that if the young People and Owners of the Land had been as ready as he, I had not met with &s;o much delay. Ha|ving thus introduced this Matter, he fell to the Bounds of the Land they had agreed to di&s;po&s;e of, and the Price (which now is little and dear, that which would have bought twenty Miles, not buy|ing now two.) During the time that this Per&s;on &s;poke, not a man of them was ob&s;erved to whi&s;per or &s;mile; the Old grave, the Young reverent in their deportment: They do &s;peak little, but fervently and with elegancy; I have never &s;een more natural &s;agacity, con&s;idering them without the help of Tradition; and he will de&s;erve the Name of wi&s;e, that out-wits them in any Treaty about a thing they under&s;tand.</P>
<P>When the Purcha&s;e was agreed, great Promi&s;es pa&s;&s;ed between us of Kindne&s;s and good Neigh|bourhood, and that the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mu&s;t live in Love as long as the Sun gave Light; which done, another made a Speech to the <HI>Indians,</HI> in the Name of all the <HI>Sachamakers</HI> or Kings, fir&s;t to tell them what was done; next, to charge and command them to love <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> and particularly to live in peace with me, and the People under my Government: That many Governors had been in the River, but that no Governor had come him&s;elf to live and &s;tay here before; and having now &s;uch a one that had treated them well, they &s;hould ne|ver do him or his any wrong.

<P>The Ju&s;tice<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ju&s;tice.</NOTE> they have is pecuni|niary; in ca&s;e of any wrong or evil fact, be it Murder it&s;elf, they atone by Fea&s;ts and Pre&s;ents of their <HI>Wampum,</HI> which is proportioned to the quality of the Of|fence, or Per&s;on injur'd, of the Sex they are of: For in ca&s;e they kill a Woman, they pay double; and the rea&s;on they render, is, That &s;he breedeth Children, which men cannot do. 'Tis rare that they fall out, if &s;ober; and if drunk, they for|give it; &s;aying, it was the Drink, and not the Man, that abu&s;ed them. We have agreed, that in all differences between us, &s;ix of each &s;ide &s;hall end the Matter. Don't abu&s;e them, but let them have Ju&s;tice, and you win them: The wor&s;t is, they are the wor&s;e for the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> who have propagated their Vices, and yielded them Tradi|tion for ill, and not for good things.

What Good then might not a good People graft, where there is &s;o di&s;tinct a Know|ledge left between good and evil? I be&s;eech God to encline the hearts of all that come into the&s;e parts, to out-live the Knowledge of the Natives, by a fixt obedience to their greater Knowledge of the Will of God; for it were mi&s;erable indeed for us to fall under the ju&s;t cen&s;ure of the poor <HI>Indian</HI> Con&s;cience, while we make profe&s;&s;ion of things &s;o far tran&s;cending.</P>

<P N="2">2. Many that had right to more Land, were at fir&s;t covetous to have their whole quantity, with|out regard to this way of &s;ettlement, though by &s;uch Wilderne&s;s-Vacancies they had ruined the Country, and their own Intere&s;t, of cour&s;e.

<P N="3">3. Our Town&s;hips lie &s;quare, generally the Village in the centre; The Hou&s;es either oppo|&s;ite, or el&s;e oppo&s;ite to the middle, betwixt two Hou&s;es over the way, for nearer neighbourhood. We have another method, that through the Village be in the centre, yet after a different manner: five hundred Acres are alotted for the Village, which, among ten Families, comes to fifty Acres each: this lies &s;quare, and on the out&s;ide of the Square &s;tands the Hou&s;es, and their fifty Acres run|ning back, who&s;e ends meeting, make the centre of the 500 Acres as they are to the whole. Before the Doors of whole Hou&s;es, lies the Highway, and cro&s;s it every man's 450 Acres of Land, that
<PB N="116" REF="69"> makes up his Complement of 500; &s;o that the conveniency of Neighbourhood is made agreeable with that of the Land.</P>

<P N="1">1. The <HI>Earth,</HI> by Gods Ble&s;&s;ing, has more than an&s;wered our expecta|tion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Earths Product.</NOTE> the poore&s;t places in our Judge|ment, producing large Crops of Garden &s;tuff, and Grain; and though our Ground has not generally the Symptoms of the fat Necks that lie upon Salt Waters in Provinces Southern of us, our Grain is thought to excel, and our Crops to be as large. We have had the mark of the good Ground among&s;t us, from thirty to &s;ixty-fold of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Corn.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Land requires le&s;s Seed; three Pecks of Wheat &s;ows an Acre; a Bu&s;hel at mo&s;t, and &s;ome have had the encrea&s;e I have mentioned.</P>
<P N="3">3. Upon Trial, we find that the Corn and Roots that grow in <HI>England,</HI> thrive very well there; as, <HI>Wheat, Barley, Rye, Oats, Buck-Wheat, Pea&s;e,

<P N="4">4. Our Low-Lands are excellent for <HI>Rape,</HI> and <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax.</HI> A Trial hath been made, and of the two la&s;t there is a con&s;iderable quantity dre&s;|&s;ed yearly.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Weeds of our Woods feed our Cattel, to the Market as well as Dairy: I have &s;een fat Bullocks brought thence to Market before <HI>Mid&s;um|mer.</HI> Our Swamps or Maar&s;hes yield us cour&s;e Hay for the Winter.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s-Seed takes well; which will give us fatting Hay in time. Of this I made an Experiment in my own Court-Yard, upon Sand that was digg'd out of my Cellar, with Seed that had lain in a Cask, open to the Weather two Winters and a Summer; I caus'd it to be &s;own in the beginning of the Month called <HI>April,</HI> and a fortnight before <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> it was fit to mow; it grew very thick; but I ordered it to be fed, being in the nature of a Gra&s;s-Plot, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee if the Roots lay firm; and though it had been meer Sand ca&s;t out of the Cellar, but a year before, the Seed took &s;uch Root, and held the Earth &s;o fa&s;t, and fa&s;tened it &s;elf &s;o well in the Earth, that it held and fed like old <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ground. I mention this, to confute the Objections that lie again&s;t tho&s;e Parts; as if that, Fir&s;t, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gra&s;s would not grow; next, not enough to mow; and la&s;tly, not firm enough to feed, from the levity of the Mould.</P>
<P N="7">7. All &s;orts of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fruits that have been tri|ed, take mighty well for the time; the <HI>Peach</HI> ex|cellent; on Standers; and in great quantities:

We fetched none, nor were we wholly kept by Neighbours; the old Inhabitants &s;upplied us with mo&s;t of the Corn we wanted, and a good &s;hare of Pork and Beef: 'Tis true, <HI>New-York, New-England,</HI> and <HI>Road-I&s;land,</HI> did with their Provi&s;ions fetch our Goods and Money, but at &s;uch Rates, that &s;ome &s;old for almo&s;t what they gave, and others carried their Provi&s;ions back, expecting a better Market nearer; which &s;hewed no &s;carcity, and that we were not totally de&s;titute in our own River.

<P>HAving an opportunity by a Ship from this Ri|ver (out of which &s;everal have gone this year) I thought fit to give a &s;hort account of Pro|ceedings, as to Settlement here, and the Improve|ment both in Town and Countrey: As to the Countrey, the Improvements are large, and Set|tlements very much thronged, by way of Town|&s;hip and Villages, great inclination to planting Orchards, which are ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, and &s;ome brought to perfection, much Hay-&s;eed &s;own, and much planting of Corn this year, and great product &s;aid to be, both of <HI>Wheat, Rye</HI> and <HI>Rice; Barly</HI> and <HI>Oats</HI> prove very well; be&s;ides <HI>Indian Corn</HI> and <HI>Pea&s;e</HI> of &s;everal &s;orts; al&s;o <HI>Kidney-Beans,</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h Pea&s;e</HI> of &s;everal kinds, I have had in my own Ground, with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Roots, <HI>Turnips, Par&s;|nips, Carrots, Onions, Leeks, Radi&s;hes</HI> and <HI>Cabbages,</HI> with abundance of Herbs and Flowers: I know but of few Seeds that have mi&s;s'd, except <HI>Ro&s;e|mary Seed,</HI> which being <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> might be old. Al|&s;o I have &s;uch plenty of <HI>Pumkins, Musk-Melons, Wa|ter Melons, Squa&s;hes, Co&s;haws, Bucks-hens, Cucum|bers</HI> and <HI>Simnels</HI> of divers &s;orts, admired at by new comers, that the Earth &s;hould &s;o plentifully ca&s;t forth, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t years breaking up, and
<PB N="123" REF="72"> on that which is counted the wor&s;t &s;ort of Sandy Land. I am &s;atisfied, and many more, that the Earth is very fertil, and the Lord hath done his part, if man u&s;e but a moderate diligence: <HI>Grapes, Mulberries,</HI> and many wild Fruits, and natural <HI>Plums</HI> in abundance this year have I &s;een and eat of. A brave Orchard and Nur&s;ery have I planted, and they thrive mightily, and bear Fruit the fir&s;t year; I endeavour to get choice of Fruits and Seeds from many parts; al&s;o <HI>Hay-Seed,</HI> and have &s;owed a Field this Spring for Trial. Fir&s;t, I burned the Leaves, then had it grubb'd, not the Fields, but the &s;mall Roots up, then &s;ow'd great and &s;mall <HI>Clovers,</HI> with a little old Gra&s;s-Seed, and had it only raked over, not plowed nor harrowed, and it grows exceedingly: Al&s;o, for Experience, I &s;owed &s;ome Patches of the &s;ame &s;ort in my Garden, and dunged &s;ome, and that grows wor&s;t; I have planted the <HI>Iri&s;h Potatoes,</HI> and hope to have a brave encrea&s;e to tran&s;plant next year. Captain <HI>Rapel</HI> (the <HI>Frenchman</HI>) &s;aith, he made good Wine of the Grapes of the Coun|try la&s;t year, and tran&s;planted &s;ome, but intends to make more this year; al&s;o a <HI>Frenchman</HI> in this Town intends the &s;ame; for Grapes are very plentiful.</P>
<P>Now as to the Town of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> it goes on in Planting and Building to admiration, both in the Front and backward, and there are about 600 Hou&s;es in three years time; and &s;ince I built my Brick-Hou&s;e, the Foundation of which was laid at my going, which I de&s;ign after a good manner, to encourage others, and that from building with Wood; it being the fir&s;t, many take example; and &s;ome that built wooden Hou&s;es, are &s;orry for it; Brick Building is &s;aid to be as cheap: Bricks

<HEAD>Advice to Adventurers how to imploy their E&s;tates with fair profit.</HEAD>
<P>It is &s;it now that I give &s;ome Adverti&s;ement to Adventurers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advice to Ad|venturers.</NOTE> which way they may lay out their money to be&s;t advan|tage, &s;o as it may yield them fair returns, and with content to all concerned, which is the la&s;t part of my pre&s;ent task; and I mu&s;t needs &s;ay &s;o much wanting, that it has perhaps given &s;ome occa&s;ion to ignorance and prejudice to run without mercy, mea&s;ure or di&s;tin|ction, again&s;t <HI>America,</HI> of which, <HI>Pen&s;ylvania</HI> to be &s;ure has had its &s;hare.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is agreed on all hands, that the poor are the hands and feet of the rich. It is their labour that improves Countries, and to encourage them, is to promote the real benefit of the Publick. Now as there are abundance of the&s;e People in many parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> extreamly de&s;irous of going to <HI>America,</HI> &s;o the way of helping them thither, or when there, and the return thereof to the Disbur|&s;ers, will prove what I &s;ay to be true.</P>
<P N="2">2. There are two &s;orts, &s;uch as are able to tran&s;|port them&s;elves and Families, but have nothing to begin with there, and tho&s;e that want &s;o much as to tran&s;port them&s;elves and Families thither.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t of the&s;e may be entertained in this manner. Say I have five thou&s;and Acres, I will &s;et|tle ten Families upon them in way of Village, and build each an Hou&s;e, an out-Hou&s;e for Cattel, fur|ni&s;h every Family with &s;tock; as four Cows, two Sows, a couple of Mares, and a yoke of Oxen, with a Town-hor&s;e, Bull and Boar. I find them with Tools, and give each their fir&s;t Ground-&s;eed;
<PB N="128" REF="75"> they &s;hall continue &s;even years, or more, at half increa&s;e, being bound to leave the Hou&s;es in repair, and a Garden and Orchard, I paying for the Trees, and at lea&s;t twenty Acres of Land within Fence, and improved to Corn and Gra&s;s. The charge will come to about &s;ixty pounds <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> each Family; at the &s;even years end, the improvement will be worth, as things go now, one hundred and twenty pounds, be&s;ides the value of the encrea&s;e of the Stock, which may be near as much more, allowing for ca&s;ualties, e&s;pecially if the People are hone&s;t and careful, or a man be upon the Spot him&s;elf, or have an Over&s;eer &s;ometimes to in&s;pect them. The charge in the whole is eight hundred thirty and two Pounds. I think I have been mode&s;t in my Computation. The&s;e Farms afterwards are &s;it for Lea&s;es at full Rent, or how el&s;e the owner &s;hall plea&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of them; al&s;o the People will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well pro|vided to &s;ettle them&s;elves with Stock upon their own Land.</P>
<P N="4">4. The other &s;ort of poor People may be very beneficially tran&s;ported upon the&s;e terms. Say I have five thou&s;and Acres, I &s;hould &s;ettle as before, I will give to each Family one hundred Acres, which in the whole makes one thou&s;and, and to each Fa|mily thirty Pounds <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> half in hand and half there, which in the whole comes to three hundred Pounds, after four days are expired, in which time they may be ea&s;ie, and in a good condition; they &s;hall each of them pay 5 <HI>l.</HI> and &s;o yearly for ever, as a Fee-farm-rent, which in the whole comes to fifty Pounds a year. Thus a Man that buys five thou&s;and Acres may &s;ecure and &s;ettle his four thou|&s;and by the gift of one, and in a way that hazard and intere&s;t allowed for, amounts to at lea&s;t ten
<PB N="129" REF="75"> <HI>per Cent.</HI> upon Land &s;ecurity, be&s;ides the value it puts upon the re&s;t of the five thou&s;and Acres. I propo&s;e that there be at the lea&s;t two working hands be&s;ides the Wife, whether Son or Servant, and that they oblige what they carry; and for fur|ther &s;ecurity, bind them&s;elves as Servants for &s;ome time, that they will &s;ettle the &s;aid Land according|ly: And when they are once &s;eated their improve|ments are &s;ecurity enough for the Rent.</P>
<P N="5">5. There is yet another expedient, and that is, to give ten Families one thou&s;and Acres for ever, at a &s;mall acknowledgment, and &s;ettle them in way of Village, as afore; by their &s;eating thus, the Land taken up is &s;ecured from others, becau&s;e the method of the Country is an&s;wered, and the value &s;uch a &s;ettlement gives to the re&s;t re&s;erved, is not incon&s;iderable, I mean the four thou&s;and Acres, e&s;pecially that which is contiguous, for their Chil|dren when grown up, and Handicrafts, will &s;oon covet to fix next them, and &s;uch and &s;uch after &s;et|tlements to begin at an improved rent in Fee, or for long Lea&s;es, or &s;mall acknowledgments, and good improvements mu&s;t advance the whole con&s;i|derably. I conceive any of the&s;e methods to i&s;&s;ue in a &s;ufficient advantage to Adventurers, and they all give good encouragement to feeble and poor Fa|milies.</P>
<P N="6">6. That which is mo&s;t advi&s;able for People in|tended thither, to carry with them, is, in &s;hort, all things relating to Apparel, Building, Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff, Husbandry, Fowling and Fi&s;hing, &s;ome Spice, Spirits, and double Beer, at fir&s;t, were not ami&s;s. But I advi&s;e all to proportion their E&s;tates thus, one third in Money, and two thirds in Goods. Up|on Pieces of Eight there will be almo&s;t a third gotten, for they go at &s;ix &s;hillings; and by Goods
<PB N="130" REF="76"> well bought, at lea&s;t fifty Pounds Sterling for every hundred Pounds, &s;o that a Man worth four hundred Pounds here, is worth &s;ix hundred Pounds there, without &s;weating.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. I purpo&s;e therefore, that Ships go hence about the middle of the Months call'd <HI>February</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which (allowing two Months for Pa&s;&s;age) reaches time enough to plant in the Spring &s;uch things as are carried hence to plant; and in the Fall, to get a &s;mall Cottage, and clear &s;ome Land again&s;t the next Spring. I have made a di&s;covery of about a hundred Miles We&s;t, and find tho&s;e back-Lands richer in Soil, Woods and Fountains, than that by <HI>Delaware,</HI> e&s;pecially upon the <HI>Sa&s;que|hanah</HI> River.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="77">
<P>3.

<P N="4">4. The Pa&s;&s;age is not to be &s;et by any Man, for Ships will be quicker and &s;lower; &s;ome having been four Months, and &s;ome but one: and as often generally between &s;ix and nine Weeks: One Year, or four and twenty Sail, I think, there was not three above nine, and there was one or two under &s;ix Weeks in Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P N="5">5. To render it more healthy; it is good to keep as much upon Deck as may be, for the Air helps again&s;t the offen&s;ive &s;mells of a crowd, and a clo&s;e place. Al&s;o to &s;crape often the Cabbins, under the Beds; and either carry &s;tore of Rue and Wormwood, and &s;ome Ro&s;emary, or often &s;prinkle Vinegar about the Cabbin. Pitch burnt is not ami&s;s &s;ometimes, again&s;t faintne&s;s and infectious Scents. I &s;peak my experience, for their benefit and direction that may need it.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e &s;ome has urged my coming back, as an argument again&s;t the place, and the proba|bility of its improvement; adding, that I would for that rea&s;on never return: I think fit to &s;ay, That next Summer (God willing) I intend to go back, and carry my Family and the be&s;t part of my per&s;onal E&s;tate with me. And this I do not not only of Duty, but Inclination and Choice. God will ble&s;s and pro&s;per poor <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P><HI>BArbada</HI> is &s;ituated in 17 degrees and a half of Northern Latitude;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation.</NOTE> of no great extent, not exceeding fifteen Miles in length, and of no great account to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of it; yet it is found to be of a fertile Soyl, well &s;tored with Cattel and Sheep, and might produce &s;everal good Commo|dities were it well manag'd, to the advantage of the Inhabitants. But it is &s;ubject to one great in|conveniency, as well as &s;ome others of tho&s;e I&s;lands, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Caribeans</HI> of <HI>Dominica,</HI> and other places,
<PB N="142" REF="82"> make frequent Incur&s;ions, and commit great Spoils in it; the enmity and aver&s;ion which tho&s;e <HI>Cani|bals</HI> have received again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation in ge|neral, be &s;o great &amp; irreconcilable, that there &s;eldom pa&s;&s;eth a Year wherein they do not make an Erupti|on into &s;ome one or other of the&s;e I&s;lands; and if not pre&s;ently di&s;covered, and vigorou&s;ly oppo&s;ed at their fir&s;t Landing, do much mi&s;chief, de&s;troying all before them with Fire and Sword, except the Women and Children, which, together with the Spoil and Plunder, they carry off to their own Territories.</P>
<P>The <HI>Caribeans,</HI> who Inhabit divers of tho&s;e I&s;lands, are generally thought to have been former|ly driven by their Enemies from the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> and forced to take &s;helter here, having among&s;t them&s;elves various and very different Opinions, Cu&s;toms and Ceremonies; &s;uch as live near, and conver&s;e with the Chri&s;tians, have re|linqui&s;h'd many of their ancient barbarous U&s;ages, and have very much civiliz'd their Conver&s;ations; which gave occa&s;ion to two ancient <HI>Caribeans</HI> to entertain &s;ome of the <HI>European</HI> Chri&s;tians with this or the like Di&s;cour&s;e. <Q>Our People are now quite degenerated from what they formerly were, and in a manner become ju&s;t like yours; and &s;o dif|ferent are we now grown from what we were before, that we find it a matter of &s;ome difficul|ty, for us to know our&s;elves. To which dege|neracy of ours, attribute tho&s;e furious Hurricanes which happen now more frequently, than they were wont to do in the Days of Old.</Q></P>
<P>The Inhabitants are hand&s;om, well-propor|tioned, of a &s;miling Countenance, their Eyes and Hair are black, their Foreheads and No&s;es flat, being cru&s;hed down by their Mothers, at the
<PB N="143" REF="82"> time of their Birth, and all the time of their Sucking, becau&s;e they imagine that flatne&s;s to be a kind of beauty and perfection: Their Feet are large and thick, and &s;o exceeding hard, that al|though they go bare-foot, neither &s;hall you &s;ee any of them blind, lame, crook-back'd, bald, or having any other natural infirmity. Such Scars and Deformities as they get in the Wars, they glory in, as evident demon&s;trations of their Va|lour. Their Hair is &s;trait and long, the Women attributing the highe&s;t excellency to that which exceeds in blackne&s;s; both Men and Women tye up their Hair behind, which they bind &s;o hard, that it &s;tands up upon their Heads like a horn, but hangs loo&s;e upon the top; it falls down again on each &s;ide of their Heads. The Men, &s;o &s;oon as their Beards begin to grow, pluck them up by the roots, accounting it a great deformity to the <HI>Europeans</HI> to wear any: both Men and Women go naked, and if any &s;hould &s;o much as endea|vour to touch their Privy-Parts, all the re&s;t will deride them: and tho&s;e who conver&s;e among&s;t the Chri&s;tians, though they are much civilized, and have for&s;aken many of their odd and barbarous Cu&s;toms, yet no per&s;wa&s;ion can prevail with them to relinqui&s;h this.</P>
<P>They generally &s;ay, they came naked into the World, and it will be a madne&s;s for them to hide the bodies nature has be&s;towed upon them; not|with&s;tanding which they change the natural co|lours of their skins, by dying them with a red Compo&s;ition, which they make for that purpo&s;e, and wherewith they always anoint them&s;elves after wa&s;hing; and many times, to make them&s;elves ap|pear the more gallant, as they imagine, they draw black Circles about their Eyes with the Juyce of Ju|niper-Apples;
<PB N="144" REF="83"> and when they would appear more gal|lant than ordinary, put on a Crown of Feathers of different colours, and hang Fi&s;h-bones, or Buck, made of Gold, Siver, or Tin, in their Ears, and &s;ome of them make holes through their Lips, or in the &s;pace between their No&s;trils, wherein they hang Rings, Fi&s;h-bones, or &s;ome &s;uch Toys, to in|crea&s;e their gallantry; and &s;ome of the better &s;ort wear Necklaces of <HI>Amber, Coral, Cri&s;tal,</HI> or &s;ome &s;uch kind of glittering &s;tuff.</P>

<P>There are not many venomous Creatures<NOTE PLACE="marg">Venomous Crea|tures.</NOTE> to be found in this I&s;land, nor in any of the <HI>Carib|bees,</HI> but yet there are many Snakes and Serpents of many colours and forms, &s;ome whereof are nine or ten foot long, and near as big as a Man's thigh; one whereof being kil|led, a whole Hen, feathers and all, were found in her belly, be&s;ides a dozen Eggs, upon which the Hen was &s;itting when the Serpent &s;eized her, which &s;hews them to be very large; notwith|&s;tanding they are not poy&s;onous, but plea&s;ure the inhabitants by freeing their Hou&s;es from Rats and other &s;uch like Vermine, which they kill and de|vour. There is another &s;ort of Serpent, above an Ell long, and not above an Inch about, which feed upon Frogs and Birds, and are in co|lour of &s;o lovely green, that they are very delightful to the eye. But there are two &s;orts of Snakes that are very hurtful and dangerous; the fir&s;t is gray on the back, and feels &s;oft like Velvet; the other is either yellow or red, very dreadful to look on, their heads being flat and broad, and their jaws exceeding wide, and armed with eight or ten teeth as &s;harp as Needles, from whence they produce their poy&s;on, which lies in little pur&s;es near the roots of their teeth; they do not chew their Food, (but &s;wallow it down whole) for if they &s;hould, the inhabitants &s;ay, they would poy&s;on them&s;elves: they are &s;o exceeding veno|mous,
<PB N="146" REF="84"> that if a man chance to be hurt by them, if help be not immediately had, the wound in two hours proves incurable: nor have they any other vertue, that de&s;erves commendation, but this, they never hurt any man, which doth not fir&s;t mo|le&s;t them.</P>

So that no Money can be rai&s;ed, or Law made, without the con&s;ent of the Inhabitants or their Repre&s;en|tatives. They are likewi&s;e thereby indued with a right to appoint and impower Governours and other Magi&s;trates, to grant Liberty of Con&s;ci|ence, make Con&s;titutions, with many other great Priviledges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as will &s;ufficiently appear by the Letters Patents. And the &s;aid Lords Proprietors have there &s;ettled a Con&s;titution of Government, whereby is granted Liberty of Con&s;cience, and wherein all po&s;&s;ible care is taken for the equal ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice, and for the la&s;ting &s;ecu|rity of the Inhabitants both in their Bodies and E&s;tates. And by their Care and Endeavours, and at their very great charge, two Colonies are likewi&s;e &s;ettled in that Province, one at <HI>Albemarl,</HI> in the mo&s;t Notherly part, and the other at <HI>A&s;hly</HI>-River, which is in the Latitude of thirty two De|grees and &s;ome odd Minutes.</P>

<P>This Colony was fir&s;t &s;ettled in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> 1670. by the Lords Proprietors, who did, at their &s;ole charge, furni&s;h out three Ships with a con&s;iderable number of able Men, and eighteen Months Provi&s;ion, together with Cloth, Tools, Ammunition, and what&s;oever el&s;e was thought nece&s;&s;ary for this new Settlement; and continued for &s;everal years after to &s;upply the place with all things nece&s;&s;ary, until the Inhabitants were, by their own indu&s;try, able to live of them&s;elves; in which condition they have now been for divers years pa&s;t, and are arrived to a very great degree of plenty, &s;o that mo&s;t &s;orts of Provi|&s;ions are cheaper there than in any other of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies.</P>

Upon the Point of Land, which divides tho&s;e two Rivers, the Proprietors, in the Year 1680. ordered the Port-Town, that &s;hould &s;erve for them both, to be built, calling it <HI>Charles</HI>-Town, which is &s;ince con&s;iderably advan|ced, to the number of near two hundred Hou&s;es, more being daily rai&s;ing by per&s;ons of all &s;orts, that repair thither from the more Northern <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>

Many that went thither in that condition, being now worth &s;everal hundred Pounds, living in a very plentiful condition, and continually adding to, and increa&s;ing their E&s;tates; &s;o that Land is already become of that value, near the Town, that it is &s;old for twenty Shillings <HI>per</HI> Acre, though pillaged of all its valuable Timber, and not cleared of the re&s;t.

<P>Such as are &s;eated near Mar&s;hy places, are &s;ome|what inclined to <HI>Agues,</HI> but in other places 'tis &s;o exceeding healthy, that in the fir&s;t nine years there died but one of tho&s;e Ma&s;ters of Families

<P>Near the Sea, the Trees<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Trees.</NOTE> are not very large, but further up they are bigger, and grow further a&s;under, and &s;o free from Under-wood, than you may &s;ee near half a Mile between the Bodies of tho&s;e Trees, who&s;e tops meeting, make a plea&s;ing &s;hade without hindering the Gra&s;s, Mirtle, and other &s;weet-&s;ented Shrubs from growing under them.

<P><HI>Carolina</HI> doth &s;o well abound with Rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Rivers.</NOTE> that within fifty miles of the Sea, you can &s;carcely place your &s;elf &s;even miles from one that is navigable; and &s;ome of them are navigable for big Ve&s;els above three hundred miles up into the Countrey. Their Rivers and Brooks abound with great variety of excellent Fi&s;h, and near the Sea with good Oy&s;ters, in &s;ome whereof Pearls are often found.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have a perfect Friend&s;hip with the Natives, and the Proprietors have taken care that no inju&s;tice &s;hall be done them; a particular Court of Judicature compos'd of the &s;obere&s;t and di&s;inter|e&s;ted Per&s;ons being e&s;tabli&s;hed by their order, to determine all differences that &s;hall happen between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and them. They are a People of a ready wit, and though illiterate, are generally found to be of a good under&s;tanding. For their keeping an account of Time, they make u&s;e of Hieroglyphicks, and in&s;truct their Children in &s;uch matters as relate to their Family and Coun|trey, which is &s;o pre&s;erved from one generation to another. Where a Battel hath been fought, or a Colony &s;etled, they rai&s;e a &s;mall Pyramid of Stones, con&s;i&s;ting of the number of the &s;lain, or tho&s;e &s;etled at the Colony; and for Religious Rites, as Sacrifices, Burials, and the like, they make round Circles with Straws or Reeds, by the differing placing whereof, it is known for
<PB N="157" REF="91"> what it is made; and to meddle with any of tho&s;e Circles, is accounted by them no better than Sa|crilege.</P>
<P>They are generally well proportioned, and &s;o well affected to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that they are ready upon all occa&s;ions to contribute their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to them; they are generally of a good and hone&s;t meaning, being no ways addicted to Vice or any Extravagancies, and always content them&s;elves with a mean Diet and Apparel for their pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, without taking much care for the time to come. They are much addicted to Mirth and Dancing, and to Acts of Courage and Valour, which they prefer above all other Virtues, and are therefore almo&s;t continually engaged in War, one Town or Village again&s;t another; their Govern|ments generally being of no greater extent; and that &s;ide which Fortune crowns with Victory, re|joyce with triumphant Jollities: By which means &s;everal Nations have been in a manner quite de|&s;troyed &s;ince our fir&s;t Settlement at <HI>A&s;hley</HI> River; which keeps them &s;o thin of People, and &s;o divi|ded among them&s;elves, that were they le&s;s affected to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> yet they would have no rea&s;on to entertain the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of Danger from them, being already too &s;trong for all the <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabit within five hundred miles of them, if they were perfectly united; which the <HI>Indians</HI> know &s;o well, that they will never adventure to fall out with them, nor offer the lea&s;t injury to any of thy <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>They wor&s;hip<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wor&s;hip.</NOTE> one God, as the cre|ator of all things, whom they call <HI>Okee,</HI> and to whom their High Prie&s;t offers Sacrifice, but believes he hath &s;ome|thing el&s;e to do than to mind humane affairs;
<PB N="158" REF="92"> which they fancy he commits to the Government of le&s;s Deities, that is, to good and evil Spirits, to whom their inferior Prie&s;ts make their Devoti|on and Sacrifices.

They are very &s;uperititious in their Marri|ages, and from a &s;trange kind of Belief which is entertained among&s;t them, that from four Wo|men only all Mankind &s;prang: They divide them|&s;elves into the like number of Tribes, and have four Burying-places; believing it to be a wicked and ominous thing to mingle their Bodies even when dead.</P>

The People u&s;ed Snake-skins of &s;ix Foot long for Girdles, and were exceedingly ravi&s;hed with the Mu&s;ick of a Gittern, a Boy dancing in a Ring about him; they were more afraid of two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma|&s;tives than of twenty Men.</P>

<P>This Emperour had about thirty Kings under him, his chief Trea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Skins, Cop|per, Pearls, Beads,</HI> and the like, all which were kept in &s;tore again&s;t his Burial, being re&s;erved on purpo&s;e again&s;t that time; his Hou&s;e being fifty or &s;ixty Yards long, frequented only by Prie&s;ts; at the four Corners &s;tood four Images, as Centi|nels, one of a <HI>Bear,</HI> another a <HI>Dragon,</HI> the third a <HI>Leopard,</HI> and the fourth a <HI>Giant:</HI> He hath as many Women as he plea&s;es, whom, after he is grown weary of, he be&s;tows upon his Favorites. His Will, with the Cu&s;tom of the Country, are his Laws, puni&s;hing his Malefactors by broiling to death, inclo&s;ed about with fire, with &s;everal other Tortures. About ten Miles from <HI>James-Town</HI> one
<PB N="186" REF="107"> of their Kings made a Fea&s;t in the Woods, the people being mo&s;t mon&s;troully painted, &s;ome like black Devils, with Horns, and their Hair loo&s;e, of variety of colours; they continued two days dancing in a Circle of a quarter of a Mile about, four in a rank, in two companies, exerci&s;ing &s;eve|ral Antick Tricks, the King leading the Dance; all in the mid&s;t had black Horns on their Heads, and green Boughs in their Hands; next whom were four or five principal Men, differently paint|ed, who with Clubs beat tho&s;e forward that tired in the Dance, which held &s;o long, that they were &s;carce able either to go or &s;tand; they made a helli&s;h noi&s;e, and throwing away their Boughs, ran clapping their Hands up into a Tree, and tearing down a Branch, fell into their order again. After this, fifteen of their proper Boys, between ten and fiften years old, painted white, were brought forth to the people, who &s;pent the Forenoon in &s;porting and dancing about them with Rattles; then, the Children being fetched away, the Women wept, and pa&s;&s;ionately cried out, providing <HI>Mo&s;s, Skins, Mats</HI> and <HI>dry Wood,</HI> making Wreaths for their Heads, and decking their Hair with Leaves; after which, they were all ca&s;t on a heap in a Valley as dead, where a great Fea&s;t was made for all the company for two hours; they then fell again into a Circle, and danced about the Youths, cau&s;ing a Fire to be made on an Altar, which our Men thought was de&s;igned to &s;acrifice them to the Devil, but it was a mi&s;take, and the <HI>Indians</HI> deluded our Men by fal&s;e &s;tories, one denying, and another af|firming the &s;ame thing, being either ignorant or unwilling to di&s;cover the devili&s;h My&s;teries of their Religion; but a King being demanded the mean|ing of this Sacrifice, an&s;wered, <HI>That the Children

<P>They think the&s;e Sacrifices &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that if o|mitted, they believe their <HI>Okee</HI> or <HI>Devil,</HI> &amp; their other Gods would hinder them from having any Deer, Turkies, Corn or Fi&s;h, and would likewi&s;e make a great Slaughter among them.

This is the fir&s;t Money laid out, nor need he be at any more Charge for in twelve Months time, he will have Ground-provi&s;ion enough, and in all probability two Crops of <HI>Tobacco.</HI></P>
<PB N="254" REF="142">
<P>The next thing to con&s;ider of, is the Improvement<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its Improve|ment.</NOTE> of the &s;aid Land, which is as followeth: After your arrival in the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> the fir&s;t &s;ix Months may be &s;pent to clear fifteen Acres of Land, and to put Provi&s;ns into the Ground; to build Conveniencies to accommodate your &s;elf and Family; to adapt and fit Ground for planting a Nur&s;ery of <HI>Cacao-Nuts;</HI> as al&s;o a Bed &s;owed with <HI>Tobacco-&s;eeds,</HI> and be &s;ure to keep your Nur|&s;ery clear from Weeds: then, about a Months time after, you have &s;own your <HI>Tobacco-&s;eed,</HI> (pro|vided the Sea&s;on be good) you may then draw your <HI>Tobacco-Plants,</HI> and plant them about &s;ome four foot di&s;tance one from another, regularly and in rows, which &s;aid <HI>Tobacco, Tobago</HI> produces, is nothing inferiour to <HI>Spani&s;h Trinidado,</HI> that lies about &s;even Leagues di&s;tance from the &s;aid I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> who &s;ell their <HI>Trinidado-Tobacco</HI> at the rate of Two Shillings a Pound, which &s;aid <HI>To|bacco</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> tran&s;port from thence to <HI>Old Spain,</HI> and &s;ell it there for con&s;iderable advantage. Now among your <HI>Tobacco-Plants,</HI> you may plant your <HI>Cacao,</HI> and tran&s;plant them, when about &s;ix Months old, into new Ground, at ten or twelve foot di&s;tance, and be &s;ure to keep them clear from Weeds, in which latter &s;ix Months time, you may have on your cleared Ground two Crops of <HI>To|bacco.</HI> Now admitting you make but Eight thou|&s;and Weight of <HI>Neat Tobacco</HI> on the &s;aid Ground, yet in all probability (provided your People be healthy) it may double the number to Sixteen thou&s;and. But if it do not, and put the ca&s;e your <HI>Tobacco</HI> &s;ell but for an eighth part of what the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ell for in <HI>Trinidado,</HI> (which is but three Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound, &s;old here in our I&s;land) yet will
<PB N="255" REF="142"> this Crop yield you One hundred Pound <HI>&s;terling,</HI> which is your Money gained the very fir&s;t Year, and in &s;ix Months time all Charges being born.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e at the beginning of the &s;econd Year, the &s;aid &s;ixteen Acres be all cleared, and Provi&s;ion enough put into the Ground, &s;ufficient for double your number of hands, you may ra|tionally then expect four Crops in twelve Months time, when as formerly you made two Crops in the la&s;t &s;ix Months; &s;o that with the Hundred Pounds you gained la&s;t Year, you may now purcha&s;e &s;even or eight Slaves, or Servants, which may in all probability treble the fir&s;t Year. But put the ca&s;e, it but only double, yet at the wor&s;t, it may yield you (and all Charges born) Two hundred Pounds <HI>&s;terling.</HI></P>
<P>Now we cannot otherwi&s;e conclude, (if things &s;ucceed well) but the third Year will double the &s;econd by improvement, as is above expre&s;&s;ed; and if &s;o, your Crop will amount to Four hundred Pounds <HI>&s;terling,</HI> and the fourth Year double the third, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Cacao</HI> that was planted the fir&s;t Year on the fifteen Acres of Land, may produce to the value of Thirty Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> an Acre, be&s;ides the encrea&s;e of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and clearing of more ground, together with your encrea&s;e of Ser|vants ana Slaves, and planting of more <HI>Cacao-Trees,</HI> which at lea&s;t will ari&s;e to Eight hundred Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> the fourth Year; the fifth Year, in all pro|bability, doubles the fourth Year; the &s;ixth Year you may very well clear Six thou&s;and Pounds <HI>&s;ter|ling,</HI> and all Charges born, by rea&s;on the <HI>Cacao,</HI> planted the fir&s;t Year, is now come to perfection, and at its full height of bearing; which in this Latitude may yield One hundred Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> an Acre, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t fifteen Acres which were planted
<PB N="256" REF="143"> the fir&s;t Year; and the &s;econd years Plants, planted the &s;econd Year, will yield you Sixty Pounds <HI>&s;ter|ling;</HI> and the third years Plants, as by the &s;ame Calculation, may yield you Thirty Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> an Acre: So that by purcha&s;ing the more Servants and Slaves, you may, if you plea&s;e, decline &s;o much planting of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> as formerly you did.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh Year you will have all your Land planted with <HI>Cacao,</HI> and that increa&s;ing, you need not plant above ten or fiften Acres of <HI>Tobacco</HI> this Year among&s;t your <HI>Cacao;</HI> but you may plant Pro|vi&s;ions among&s;t them, for &s;upport and maintenance of your &s;elf and Family. So that from that In|crea&s;e of your &s;eventh Year's Crop, you may hope and expect, by a mode&s;t computation, to clear from the &s;aid fifty Acres of Land, at lea&s;t Five thou|&s;and Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> a Year.</P>
<P>And now we come to the Rea|&s;ons for this great Improvement;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Rea&s;ons for Improvement.</NOTE> You mu&s;t con&s;ider, that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in <HI>Trinidado,</HI> &amp;c. give a|mong them&s;elves One hundred Pounds <HI>&s;terling,</HI> for a <HI>Negro</HI>-Slave, and yet the &s;aid Slave will not &s;tand his Ma&s;ter in one &s;ingle Penny at the Year's end for his purcha&s;e; and all the labour and &s;ervice the <HI>Spaniard</HI> imploys him in the Year about, is only in <HI>Cacao</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h-Tobacco,</HI> in this our Lati|tude.</P>
<P>Now pray con&s;ider, that we can have <HI>Negro</HI>-&s;laves brought and delivered to us at Fifteen Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> a head, by rea&s;on we have an open Trade, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> allows not of a free Trade. Where note, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> pays Six-pence or more for every thing he wants, when we have the &s;ame for a &s;ingle Penny. That's one Rea&s;on.</P>
<PB N="241" REF="143">
<P>The &s;econd Rea&s;on is, The <HI>Spaniard</HI> cannot have any Tunnage for Goods from <HI>Old Spain</HI> to the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and home again, for le&s;s than Forty or Fifty Pounds <HI>&s;terling per</HI> Tun; be&s;ides, the Du|ties run very high: And we can have, Freight for Five or Six Pounds <HI>per</HI> Tun, and no Duties from us to a tree Port. When therefore, to con&s;ider and compute the Charge on either &s;ide, we profit by what we tran&s;port &s;ix to one; which makes the <HI>Spaniard</HI> generally &s;o poor in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and we generally to flouri&s;h &s;o much the more.</P>
<P>The third Rea&s;on is, That in a Ship of Three hundred Tun, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have &s;eldom le&s;s than two hundred Men belonging to her, and the Wages each Man comes to at lea&s;t Fifty Shilling <HI>&s;terling per</HI> Month, which, in the whole, amounts to Five hundred Pounds a Month, barely for Wages; then you are to con&s;ider the Monthly Provi&s;ions, to accommodate the&s;e Men, cannot come to le&s;s than One hundred and fifty Pounds <HI>&s;terling;</HI> and Ten Months, at Six hundred and fifty Pounds <HI>per</HI> Month, amounts to Six thou&s;and and five hundred Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> for Ten Months. Moreover, this Ship of Three hundred Tun, &s;eldom carries le&s;s than Forty Pieces of Ordnance, which with their Provi&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by mode&s;t computation, takes up no le&s;s room than One hundred and fifty Tun; &s;o that the Ship, in all probability, cannot bring home more than One hundred and fifty Tun of Merchants Goods, and the Freight of the&s;e Goods comes to Forty Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> a Tun, to pay Ware and Tare of the Ship and Mens Wages; &s;o that for the Ship's Ware and Tare, it comes barely but to One hundred and fifty Pounds <HI>&s;terling</HI> clear.</P>
<P>Now admit an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship of Three hundred Tun, be bound for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e the
<PB N="258" REF="144"> Freight of this Ship be at Six Pounds <HI>&s;terling per</HI> Tun, this Ship &s;hall make her Voyage better in Eight Months time than the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;hall in Ten Months; now the Freight of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship comes to One thou&s;and eight hundred Pounds <HI>&s;ter|ling,</HI> and the Wages and Victuals of the &s;aid Ship, at Sixty Pounds <HI>per</HI> Month, comes to Four hundred and eighty Pounds <HI>&s;terling;</HI> &s;o that you &s;ee the Ship clears, for her Ware and Tare, the &s;um of One thou&s;and three hundred and twenty Pounds <HI>&s;terling.</HI> See here therefore the great difference.</P>
<P>The fourth and la&s;t rea&s;on is this; The King of <HI>Spain</HI> contracts with a body of Merchants, to fur|ni&s;h the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> with Four thou&s;and <HI>Negroes</HI> every Year, and the <HI>Nigrilloes,</HI> or Merchants, there engage to pay the King one hundred Pieces of Eight Cu&s;tom for each <HI>Negro</HI>-&s;lave brought unto them; which comes to Four hundred thou&s;and Pieces of Eight by the Year, which is paid to the &s;aid King; the King therefore prohibits all Merchants and others, for bringing <HI>Negroes</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and each Piece of Eight is valued at Five Shillings <HI>&s;terling</HI> in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> but in the <HI>Leeward I&s;lands</HI> it goes for &s;ix.</P>
