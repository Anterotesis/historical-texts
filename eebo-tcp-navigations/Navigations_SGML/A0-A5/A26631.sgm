<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL RELATION OF THE DISCOVERY Of the ISLE of MADERA.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter a tedious War, <HI>England</HI> enjoying a profound Peace, under the reign of her victorious Monarch, <HI>Edward</HI> the third. <HI>London</HI> her Metropolis (where then re&s;ided the King) &s;urfeiting in Ri|ches and Plenty, did allure the young Gentle men to participate of her plea&s;ures: The&s;e, having now no imployment for their &s;words, did betake them&s;elves to &s;uch Recreations as be&s;t &s;uited
<PB N="2" REF="3">
with their natures.) Among&s;t whom <HI>Lionel Machin</HI> a younger Brother, of a good but a decayed Family, (impoveri&s;ht in the former wars) &s;lighting the Vanities and Fea&s;tings, to which his Companions (who were thereunto addicted) might by their examples invite him, did deport him&s;elf with a more re&s;erved behaviour. His Beauty and Cou|rage, together with the good Fortune, which u&s;u|ally attended his generous undertakings, rendered him more con&s;iderable than was u&s;ual for Per&s;ons of his Age and E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Thus generou&s;ly demeaning him&s;elf, Love in&s;en|&s;ibly crept into his heart for <HI>Arabella Darcy,</HI> a mo&s;t fair and beautiful youn g Lady, the non-paril not onely of the Court, but Kingdome famous for &s;uch wonders; he publickly made his addre&s;|&s;es of love unto, which Pa&s;&s;ion he unadvi&s;edly cheri&s;hed, without con&s;idering that his Mi&s;tre&s;s be|ing in the prime of yourh and Beauty, Heir to a great E&s;tate, and allied to a mo&s;t honourable Fa|mily, had by the&s;e motives attracted many Lords and Noble-men to be her Servants: Notwith&s;tand|ing <HI>Lionels</HI> merit made him more kindly be receiv|ed by <HI>Arabella,</HI> than any of his other Rivals, who had &s;ubmitted them&s;elves under the Empire of &s;o fair and charming a Sovereign.</P>
<P>But I intend not to write the particular Hi&s;tory of their Loves; and therefore &s;hall omit by what means he at length arrived to &s;o much happine&s;s: Let it &s;uffice to know none of the Lords addre&s;&s;es were acceptable to <HI>Arabella,</HI> &s;he de&s;iring nothing more than to make <HI>Lionel</HI> her Hu&s;band. This was not well relli&s;hed by her Relations, by whom, her
<PB N="3" REF="3">
Father and Mother coming to under&s;tand the re|ciprocal kindne&s;s of our Lovers, which they in vain &s;aught to ob&s;truct, they immediately made their complaints to the King, repre&s;enting what a detriment &s;uch a marriage would prove to their Family, they having before concluded a very ad|vantagious match for their Daughter (which &s;he now refu&s;ed to embrace) and therefore they mo&s;t humbly be&s;aught his Maje&s;ty to u&s;e his Royal Au|thority to hinder it. The King thought the be&s;t means was, that <HI>Lionel,</HI> by his Order, &s;hould be arre&s;ted, and that during his impri&s;onment <HI>Ara|bella</HI> &s;hould be compelled to marry the Nobleman her Parents had before de&s;igned her. At the &s;ame time both the one and the other was executed, <HI>Lionel</HI> being &s;ent to Pri&s;on, and <HI>Arabella,</HI> in &s;pight of all her repugnance, forced to take the Lord for her husband: Who pre&s;ently after the wedding retlred with his Wife from <HI>London</HI> to his hou&s;e at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> a Sea-port Town &s;cituate on the River <HI>Avon,</HI> which joyning with another River called the <HI>Se|vern,</HI> coming from the Province of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> both together di&s;emboug them&s;elves into the Iri&s;h O|cean.</P>
<P><HI>Lionel</HI> hears the news of this Marriage with a great deal of Sorrow, and being a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>Ara|bella</HI>'s affection toward him was not dimini&s;hed, he lo&s;t all patience to be detained in Pri&s;on, and therefore imployed his Friends to &s;upplicate the King for his liberty, which was not very difficult to obtain, his Maje&s;ty having no farther end in the bu&s;ine&s;s, than to content the Ladies Parents (who&s;e marriage being now &s;olemnized) and &s;he removed
<PB N="4" REF="4">
a great way off) he at &s;mall entreaty granted <HI>Lio|nel</HI> his liberty. <HI>But as the violence, which others u&s;e to hinder our de&s;ires, doth rather augment than dimini&s;h their force.</HI> So <HI>Lionells</HI> pa&s;&s;ion by his im|pri&s;onment grew &s;tronger, revolving in his mind, during his re&s;traint, divers wayes how to be re|venged of tho&s;e he thought had done him wrong; and re&s;olved, being now at liberty, to execute them. For this purpo&s;e, &s;ecretly gathering to|gether &s;uch of his Friends and Kin&s;men in whom he put the mo&s;t con&s;idence, judging it nece&s;&s;ary with &s;ome rea&s;ons to per&s;wade them to be a&s;&s;i&s;tant to him in his de&s;igns, he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>You cannot but think, that the re&s;entment I have for the late affront put upon me is the cau&s;e of your pre|&s;ent convention. And I am per&s;waded, if I were &s;o ba&s;e a Fellow to forget it, yet you have &s;o much honour as not to let me neglect a revenge. The apparent inju&s;tice done me in forcing the Lady <HI>Arabella</HI> contrary to her inclinations to e&s;pou&s;e him, who it at pre&s;ent her Hu&s;|band, is no doubt a great affliction to her, but more to me, who was and &s;till am her Lover. Revenge and love hurry me on &s;trange undertakings, for I am re|&s;olved to take her from him, and free my Mi&s;tre&s;s out of the hands of a man &s;he hates, The action, I con|fe&s;s, is both bold and dangerous, but I &s;hould think my &s;elf unworthy of &s;uch Friends, if I had not cou|rage to attempt it with your a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I would wil|lingly undertake this concern alone, and not expo&s;e you, my Friends, to the dangers that attend this en|terpri&s;e, but I &s;hould be unju&s;t to you my worthy Kin&s;|men, not to let you participate in the revenge, for though the injury is only done me, yet the affront is put
<PB N="5" REF="4">
upon our whole Family. I were therefore much too blame, if I went &s;ingly to retort abu&s;es done us all. Were the enterpri&s;e &s;olely on my account, I would not doubt your aid, &s;ince enemies who openly offend us are more pardonable, than tho&s;e complemental Friends, who in time of nece&s;&s;ity refu&s;e us their help, &s;hould therefore any of you abandon me, I have more rea&s;on to complain of him, than of a profe&s;&s;ed Enemy. But &s;ince I doubt not thereof, let us, Dear Friends, con&s;i|der how we may make our affronters &s;en&s;ible of the In|ju&s;tice they have done us.</P>
<P>This Harangue of <HI>Lionell</HI> produced all the de&s;ir|ed effects in the minds of them who heard it, they unanimou&s;ly promi&s;ing not to leave him, but re&s;ol|ving to run his Fortune. Whereupon it was thought nece&s;&s;ary, they &s;hould then part, and take &s;everal Roads to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> there to watch all means, and take nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures to relieve <HI>Arabella.</HI> The vici|nity and commodity of the Sea did &s;eem greatly to facilitate their enterpri&s;e. <HI>France</HI> being pitched up|on as a commodious retreat, the great antipathy between that Crown and <HI>England,</HI> promi&s;ing them all the &s;ecurity they could de&s;ire. They did not que&s;tion good &s;ucce&s;s, it depending on their cou|rages, which were highly excited by divers hero|ique actions, which had been gloriou&s;ly atchieved when Love was the cau&s;e of undertaking them.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution taken was in&s;tantly put in execu|tion, and being all &s;afely arrived at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> as they had before projected; they there again con&s;ulted how farther to pro&s;ecute what they had begun, and it was thought convenient by them all, that one of their Company &s;hould endeavour to procure
<PB N="6" REF="5">
a &s;ervice in the hou&s;e of <HI>Arabella</HI>'s Husband, my Lord&mdash;but we know not his name, for the <HI>Eng|gli&s;h</HI> to whom we are beholding for this Relation, held it di&s;cretion to keep it &s;ecret. Their eyes were in&s;tantly upon one judged mo&s;t proper for that purpo&s;e, who willingly undertook it, and was entertained by the Lord as his Groom. It was his good fortune to have a&s;&s;igned to his care a fair pi|ed Hor&s;e, on which <HI>Arabella</HI> often rode, when &s;he went to take the Air, either in company of her Husband or alone. The innocence of tho&s;e times e&s;teeming a Ladies honour to be a &s;ufficient guard, though the pre&s;ent Age is not of that opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> being as great a Town of Trade as mo&s;t in <HI>England,</HI> there were always in the Harbor many Ships ready to &s;et Sail. One of the be&s;t &s;ailing and &s;tronge&s;t Ve&s;&s;els <HI>Lionel</HI> and his Companions re&s;olv|ed to &s;eize; the negligence of the Commander, and vigilence of <HI>Lionel</HI> gave them great hopes there would not be much difficulty in effecting their de|&s;ires: The better to carry on their work they bought a Shallop, with which they every day rowed out to Sea, as on their plea&s;ure, &s;o that when they &s;hould &s;eize on <HI>Arabella</HI> and the Ship they might do it with more facility and le&s;s &s;u&s;pition, both on the People a &s;hore and tho&s;e aboard the Ve&s;&s;els, which rode at an Anchor near the Ship they intended to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e things were doing by the Con&s;pira|tors, <HI>Arabella</HI> had hourly notice from her new do|me&s;tick of what ever was re&s;olved on in their Cabal, and accordingly took her mea&s;ures: in a &s;hort time all things being favourable, and the wind come fair at North <HI>Arabella</HI> had notice, that, in a day or two,
<PB N="7" REF="5">
they intended to put their de&s;ign in execution.</P>
<P>The place <HI>Lionel</HI> had cho&s;en daily to come to with his &s;hallop was behind a Cape of Land very convenient for his purpo&s;e, becau&s;e little frequented, and by rea&s;on of the &s;olitarine&s;s of the place not at all &s;ubject to any rancounter might unluckily hap|pen in that juncture of time, the Groom al&s;o to fa|vour the bu&s;ine&s;s, had omitted for three Days to give any Drink to the pyed Hor&s;e which was his Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> (when &s;he knew all things were in readi|ne&s;s and that <HI>Lionel</HI> and his Companions waited for her in the &s;hallop, with impatience expecting that happy Hour they had &s;o long waited for) mounted on Hor&s;eback on pretence of taking the Air, and rode towards the Cape before mentioned, the Hor&s;e being extream thir&s;ty, hearing the Waves beat again&s;t the Shoar, and thereby knowing the nearne&s;s of the wa|ter ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly on in &s;pight of the bit or tho&s;e that led him, all that the pretended Groom could do was to catch hold on the reins &s;eeming thereby, to &s;top him when indeed he only guided him towards the Shallop, which he might the ea&s;ier do becau&s;e the Hor&s;e, &s;eeing him&s;elf led towards Water which he much de&s;ired, did not unwillingly &s;ubmit to be &s;o guided. <HI>Lionel</HI> and his Comrades &s;eeing what was done a Shoar leaped out of the Shallop (where they attended the beginning of that good fortune &s;hould put an end to their Di&s;grace) and mo&s;t officiou&s;ly, laying hold on the Hor&s;es bridle di&s;mounted the <HI>La</HI>dy, and immediately with the cunning Groom em|barqued in the Shallop, &s;o that before the other Ser|vants could come to the Sea &s;ide. Our adventurers
<PB N="8" REF="6">
were got a good di&s;tance thence having with Sails and Oars dilligently endeavoured &s;o to do.</P>
<P>The Day appointed to put this Action in execu|tion was al&s;o de&s;igned for &s;eizing the Ve&s;&s;el we be|fore &s;poke of, which was the ea&s;ier accompli&s;hed in regard that at the &s;ame time the Owners made a fare|wel fea&s;t a Shore, to which the Ma&s;ter, Mariners, Officers, and Souldiers were invited, &s;o that the Ve&s;|&s;el being in a manner empty, was without difficulty &s;urprized by <HI>Lionel</HI> and his Friends, upon which &s;o &s;oon as they were embarqued loo&s;ing the &s;ails, and cutting the Cable, they &s;teered their Cour&s;e for <HI>France,</HI> the Wind blowing a bri&s;k gale carried the Ship &s;wiftly away, which was very happy for our Lovers. What a noi&s;e the recital of this adventure made, not onely in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but al&s;o throughout all <HI>England,</HI> what de&s;cants was made thereof, or what dangers the Actors underwent, and what puni&s;hment they de&s;erved, let the Reader imagine, for we intend not to particularize them in our Relations.</P>
<P>The Eyes of Love are not always blind, for <HI>Lio|nel</HI> con&s;idering the quality of the offence he had com|mitted, &amp; again&s;t whom, &s;oon bethought him&s;elf that the Husband of <HI>Arabella</HI> was a per&s;on of &s;uch Qua|lity, as having not only his own power but al&s;o the Authority of Ju&s;tice in his behalf, would not fail to make all the Ships then in Harbor pur&s;ue the Ra|vi&s;hers of his Wife and Honour, <HI>Lionel</HI> therefore to prevent being overtaken, made all the &s;ail he could not caring how &s;oon he lo&s;t the &s;ight of Land. At Night he altered the Cour&s;e that in the Day he had &s;teered, the better to blind any that &s;hould pur&s;ue him; all that Night they &s;ailed with &s;uch a &s;wiftne&s;s as
<PB N="9" REF="6">
u&s;ually accompany's them that run headlong into their own ruine, the Day en&s;uing he found him&s;elf out of danger of pur&s;uit. But the Wind, which hi|therto had continued favourable and gentle, now began to be &s;o impetuous that it &s;eemed rather to blow a Storm then a fair gale.</P>
<P><HI>Arabella</HI> now began to reflect on what was pa&s;t, and con&s;ider her former and pre&s;ent condition, mu|&s;ing on the&s;e things &s;he came upon the deck, the bet|ter to divert her melancholy, where &s;eeing no|thing but a Tempe&s;tuous Sea, and an Air &s;he had not been accu&s;tomed unto, &s;he then perceived what a mi&s;erable e&s;tate &s;he had reduced her &s;elf unto; the poor Ve&s;&s;el being now become the &s;port of the Sea and Wind was a general grief and affliction to them all.</P>
<P>After five Days of Navigation, without di&s;cover|ing the Land they looked for, the wind became &s;o cro&s;s and vehement as it quite forced them from the coa&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> whether their de&s;ires tended; the Friends of <HI>Lionel,</HI> who were not &s;o amorous as him|&s;elf, &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible of their deplorable e&s;tate, perceiving how equally fortune treated them mak|ing no di&s;tinction between the innocent and guilty, and that they were all like to &s;hare in the common danger. But <HI>Lionel,</HI> was mo&s;t extreamly tormented to con&s;ider, that he was not only the means of bringing him&s;elf into that ruin but al&s;o his Friends, and chief|ly her whom he Loved more dear more than his Life.</P>
<P>Thirty Days were they in this Calamity running through the va&s;t and dangerous de&s;erts of the O|cean, de&s;titute of all Hope and Hourly expecting
<PB N="10" REF="7">
death: when one morning about Sun-ri&s;ing, they be|gan to have &s;ome Hopes for they thought they ken|ned Land, which in a little time they plainly di&s;co|vered, it &s;hewing it &s;elf to be an I&s;land&punc; High, craggy, and covered with trees; this gave all the Company a great deal of Joy, though <HI>Arabella</HI> received the mo&s;t con&s;olation, for &s;he now hoped after &s;o dangerous and weari&s;ome a Navigation, to find that repo&s;e which was nece&s;&s;ary for her, an end of all her pains and a new manner of living.</P>
<P><HI>Lionel</HI> was very much troubled to find a &s;afe Port in this unknown Land, fearing to be &s;plit again&s;t &s;ome Rock, he therefore &s;ounded, and not without a great deal of circum&s;pection, came &s;afely to an An|chor. They could not perceive any humane Crea|ture on Shore, and tho&s;e which were be&s;t &s;killed in Navigation thoughtit not inhabited, which they were the more induced to believe, becau&s;e a great number of Birds differing in bigne&s;s, &s;ort, and colour came and perched them&s;elves upon the Yards, Ma&s;ts, and Shrouds of the Ship without being any thing afraid of the Men, or endeavouring to avoid their being taken.</P>
<P>To be more fully informed both Curio&s;ity and nece&s;&s;ity made the mo&s;t hardy to get out the boat and go a Shoar, <HI>Lionel</HI> would fain have been one of them, but neither <HI>Arabella</HI> or his Companions would &s;uffer it, not thinking it convenient he &s;hould &s;tir out of the Ve&s;&s;el till the return of his other Friends, which they &s;oon did filled with very good news, re|porting though the I&s;land was uninhabited yet the Air was good and the Earth fertile. Upon the&s;e ti|dings <HI>Lionel</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> with mo&s;t of the Men
<PB N="11" REF="7">
(leaving the re&s;t aboard to look after the Ship) went into the Boatand landed on the banks of that Land where never before any man had &s;et his Foot.</P>
<P>It being very fair weather &amp; a clear &s;ea&s;on, the Sun as it ro&s;e higher di&s;covered to our Voyagers a mo&s;t dainty and delicious Country, the Mountains and Hills all covered with &s;hady Trees, the Valleys filled with &s;mall Currants, &amp; many bubling Springs of pure and clear Water. The I&s;land was al&s;o filled with &s;un|dry Bea&s;ts, who, unacquainted with the &s;ight of man, the pre&s;ence of our adventurers did not affright, find|ing all things thus accord to their wi&s;hes it incou|raged them to proceed to a further di&s;covery with a great deal of confidence: &s;ome di&s;tance from their fir&s;t Landing they found a place &s;urrounded with Lawrels &amp; other &s;hady Trees (though they knew not how to call them) who&s;e branches filled with large leaves were &s;o conjoyned as they made a perfect Ar|bor plea&s;ant and &s;hady, from the Mountain <HI>Adjacent</HI> de&s;cended a fine River which formed a mo&s;t curious Pond clo&s;e by the Arbor. This our Voyagers thought a convenient place for their refre&s;hments and &s;o with Boughs and the like Materials they made it fit to re|ceive them, re&s;olving for &s;ome time after &s;uch hard|&s;hips as they had indured to take the plea&s;ures &s;o &s;weet a Country did afford them. Now therefore every one betook him&s;elf to what his Fancy prompt|ed him, &s;ome imploying them&s;elves more exactly to &s;earch into the Woods. Others to run over the Hills and Dales to find what might be further worth their di&s;covery. Whil&s;t the re&s;t betook them&s;elves to carry Nece&s;&s;aries aboard and bring others a Shore from their Ship.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="8">
But the misfortune which attended our fugitives was too great to let this tranquility la&s;t long, for the Night which &s;ucceeded the Thirteenth Day after their arrival there, hapned &s;o horrible a &s;torm which came from the North-Ea&s;t that all the force and indu&s;try of tho&s;e who found them&s;elvs on board the Ship, which was then at an Anchor, could not with&s;tand the fury of the Wind and Sea. But they were forced to abandon her to their rage, and for two Dayes they were in the &s;ame Jeopardy they &s;o lately were delivered out of, at the end of which they once more di&s;covered Land; the Ve&s;&s;el being leaky and they un&s;kilful Marriners they were forced to run her a &s;hore, which was but the beginning of new Mi&s;eries, for they no &s;ooner were Landed but they found them&s;elves on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> in the Kingdome of <HI>Morocco.</HI> The Mores who from the Mountains beheld this pitiful &s;hipwrack de&s;cended and &s;eized upon the poor Chri&s;tians, haling them into &s;lavery and impri&s;oning them in the Jayl of their Capital City. Thereby making it appear that the&s;e Mon&s;ters of Men were more cruel then the E|lements, for the latter intended to &s;pare their lives when the former were &s;o unmerciful as to make them undergo a perpetual bondage.</P>
<P>The day light which &s;ucceeded this unhappy night, was more uncomfortable to tho&s;e a&s;hore than the dark|ne&s;s had been terrible, or the &s;torm frightful to them aboard, for there appearing no &s;hip in Port, neither when the Tempe&s;t was over any returning (for they till then had hoped, that the extreamity of the wea|ther had only forced her out to Sea) notwith&s;tand|ing their valour, all the courage they had could not
<PB N="13" REF="8">
draw them out of di&s;pair, for now they &s;aw them|&s;elves de&s;titute of any means ever to return from that unknown part of the World. The mo&s;t under|&s;tanding of them judging, that by rea&s;on of the few people on board, and their unexperience in Mari|time affairs, the Ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;wallow|ed up of the waters.</P>
<P>After this deplorable accident, tho&s;e among&s;t them, who had been the chief In&s;truments of bringing them|&s;elves and friends into this mi&s;erable e&s;tate, began &s;e|riou&s;ly to repent of their folly, though the Lady was the mo&s;t concerned, well knowing this &s;ad Voyage was chiefly made on her account, &s;o that &s;he fell in|to a deep melancholly, but dangers being infinite more horrible in them&s;elves than we can paint them; it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to de&s;cribe the grief which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed her brea&s;t, for &s;o deeply was &s;he afflicted that from that moment to the time of her death &s;he utter|ed not one word: <HI>Exce&s;s of &s;orrow is alwayes mute, rejecting the common way of ea&s;ing it &s;elf by &s;ighs and lamentations.</HI></P>
<P>Three dayes was death in killing &s;o amiable an in|fortunate, &s;he expiring with all manner of contri|tion and repentance, <HI>Lionel</HI> had &s;ome further time granted him by God, that his &s;orrows might be in|crea&s;ed, and he afflicted; for it was but ju&s;t, that he who was the mo&s;t criminal, &s;hould undergo the greate&s;t &s;ufferings.

&s;o that in the beginning of <HI>June</HI> in the year 1420, <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> was &s;et to &s;et to Sea with one Ship very well equippied, and another Ve&s;&s;el, which row|ed with Oars, with which on &s;uch occa&s;ions they u&s;|ed to &s;erve them&s;elves.

<P>There ran a rumour among the <HI>Portugals,</HI> that off the I&s;land <HI>Porto Santo</HI> (to which place <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> in|tended fir&s;t to &s;teer) towards the North-ea&s;t there u&s;ually appeared a perpetual ob&s;curity, which al|wayes extended it &s;elf from the Sea to the Sky, and never dimini&s;hed, but alwayes did appear in the very &s;ame manner, this every one knew to be true that lived in <HI>Porto Santo,</HI> and becau&s;e in that infan|cy of Navigation, they wanted the u&s;e of the <HI>A&s;tro|labe,</HI> and other in&s;truments &s;ince invented, it was judged miraculous, if not impo&s;&s;ible to go and re|turn from that black place or Cloud, but that they, who &s;hould venture, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity for their bold|ne&s;s lo&s;e their lives. This ignorance of the Sea and its &s;ecrets was the cau&s;e, that this ob&s;curity was ge|nerally called an Aby&s;s. Some &s;aid it was the mouth of Hell, and were upheld in their opinions by Di|vines, as &s;imple as them&s;elves, who offered to prove both by Argument and Authorities, that it might very well be &s;o. The Hi&s;torian who pretend to be more knowing than the others, did e&s;teem it to be the I&s;land anciently called <HI>Cipango,</HI> which God had wonderfully hidden in the Clouds to protect the Spani&s;h and Portugueze Bi&s;hops and Chri&s;tians, who had retired them&s;elves thither, out of the per&s;ecu|tion of the Moors and Saracens. And that it was di|rectly

contrary to God's plea&s;ure to endeavour a clearer di&s;covery, for if he had plea&s;ed to have it performed he would have manife&s;ted his approbati|on by &s;uch miracles as u&s;ually precede his allowance, and that be&s;ides divers &s;uch ancient Prophecies under &s;evere penalties, forbid the further &s;earch into this Mi&s;tery.</P>
<P><HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> &s;ailed towards the I&s;le of <HI>Porto Santo</HI> in very fair weather, and proper for his voyage; but fearing in the dark he might pa&s;s &s;omething wor|thy of note, he made them every night lower their Sails, and lie at Hull, proceeding onely in the day, that he might the better &s;ee any land they &s;hould ac|cidently di&s;cover. This was no &s;uch hindrance un|to him, but that in a little time he arrived at <HI>Porto Santo;</HI> where he and the re&s;t of his company were &s;hewed the black Cloud beforementioned (which <HI>Jean de Morales</HI> judged to be the beginning of that Land they &s;aught after.</P>

<P>The Pilot <HI>Jean de Morales</HI> was of opinion by the information he had received from the Engli&s;h, and the cour&s;e he had made them &s;teer, that the I&s;land he &s;aught after was not far from thence, and told <HI>Gon|&s;alve</HI> that the rayes of the Sun lying very hot on the Earth, and drawing thence the humidity (of which there was a great quantity, by rea&s;on of the multipli|city of Trees) made a gro&s;s vapour to a&s;cend, which

filling the Skie with its foggyne&s;s was the rea&s;on of the ob&s;curity they &s;aw, and that he was confident by the&s;e tokens, the Land they &s;o much coveted to di&s;|cover, was not far from that place.</P>
<P>All of them were of a contrary opinion to <HI>Morales</HI> and tumultuou&s;ly cryed, how that he being a Ca&s;ti|lian, and by con&s;equence an Enemy, was very well plea&s;ed to &s;ee their Nation expo&s;ed to evident dan|gers, that it was enough for men to encounter men, without commencing a war again&s;t the Elements, that it became only Heathens and Infidels to pene|trate into the &s;ecrets of God, that they were to ex|pect nothing but death from that cloud, and that to proceed further was only to dare the Almighty, that the Infant was ill &s;erved to have his Servants ex|po&s;ed to &s;uch unprofitable dangers, but the King was wor&s;e u&s;ed in regard they were his mo&s;t faithful Subjects, who might &s;erve him in more fei&s;ible un|dertakings, than to &s;earch after a &s;uppo&s;ed Land on no other ground than the Pilots vain imaginations.</P>
<P>They farther argued that <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> was a Nobleman of great merit, he might expect large recompences from his own de&s;erts without precipitating him&s;elf and them into &s;uch certainty of peril; that valour was never &s;hewn in pu&s;hing forward de&s;pair, that it was no charity under pretence of Religion to find out people and &s;eize on their Countries, whereby they &s;hewed them&s;elves rather covetous of their own than God's glory, but that they ought to be con|tent with tho&s;e Lands they already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and finally affirmed they were but men, and therefore would not undergo what &s;eemed to be above Mor|tals &s;trength.</P>

<P>The Voyage continuing for &s;ome time in this man|ner, the Cloud, into which they where now entred, &s;eemed to le&s;&s;en and decrea&s;e towards the Ea&s;t, but the waters made a terrible noi&s;e, notwith&s;tanding they pa&s;&s;ed the ob&s;curity, and having &s;o done (a Cloud, which hung on the Earth, hindring their clearer pro&s;pect) they thought they di&s;covered land, and &s;aw many armed men of a prodigeous bigne&s;s thereon. But they after found, that the Shore be|ing full of high Rocks was the occa&s;ion of their mi|&s;take. The Air pre&s;ently clearing, and the Sun &s;hi|ning out, they plainly made the Land. This happi|ne&s;s they received with the greater joy, becau&s;e not by them expected; The fir&s;t place pre&s;ented it &s;elf to their view was a high point of Land, to which <HI>Gon|&s;alve</HI> gave the name of Cape St. <HI>Laurence.</HI></P>
<P>Which point having doubled, they &s;aw a brave and fertile Country, full of fair and high Trees, which in Woods and Groves extended them&s;elves from the Mountains through the Valleys, to the ve|ry Sea-&s;ide. The Cloud was now &s;o far retired, as it &s;eemed only to crown the heads of the Mountains. This plea&s;ant &s;ight gave the minds of our Voyagers a great deal of content, the dangers and hazards they had formerly mutined about being now forgot they imbraced one another with joy, rendring thanks fir&s;t to God, and then to their Commander by who&s;e encouragement and per&s;wa&s;ion, they were now

Some were in&s;tantly preparing to go a &s;hore, but the Sun, being then &s;et, 'twas thought fit to de|fer it till the morning. <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> commanded a good Watch to be kept that night, becau&s;e &s;leep is a Rock, and the more dangerous, becau&s;e no Pilot finds it in his Sea charts.</P>
<P>The day following <HI>Ruy Paes</HI> by order of <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> made him&s;elf ready to go a &s;hore, which he did (in one of the rowing &s;hallops beforementioned) with a well armed company of &s;ouldiers, he landed on the the very &s;ame place <HI>Lionel</HI> before had done, and by certain tokens <HI>Jean de Morales</HI> had given him, found with much &s;atisfaction the foot&s;teps of the Engli&s;h, and divers trees notched with a hatchet, which he knew to be infallible &s;igns of men having been there, pa&s;&s;ing thence into the Forre&s;t he &s;aw the great Tree, and coming nearer perceived the Cro&s;s, and read the Epitaph of out Lovers, which ab&s;olutely confirmed the Pilots relations. This &s;pectacle cau&s;ed a great deal of compa&s;&s;ion in <HI>Ruy Paes,</HI> and his Companions, ma|king them &s;hed &s;ome tears, thereby confirming what long &s;ince <HI>Seneca</HI> wrote, that <HI>Pity is the fir&s;t de|gree of Kindne&s;s among men.</HI></P>
<P>After the&s;e recognizances the &s;ame day they re|turned to <HI>Jean Gon&s;alve,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured him that they had met with all things, as <HI>Jean de Morales</HI> had be|fore related, upon which knowledge he di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf to di&s;embarque, which he did with all the

precaution and &s;olemnity imaginable, taking po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, for and in the Name of Don <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and of the Infant Don <HI>Henry</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Order and Knight of Chri&s;t, the water was ble&s;&s;ed by two religious, and with it the Air and Earth clean&s;ed by calling on the name of God. An Altar was al&s;o erected, and Ma&s;s &s;aid where <HI>Lionel</HI> and <HI>Arabella</HI> lay buried. This Ceremony was per|formed on the Fea&s;t day of Saint <HI>Elizabeth.</HI></P>
<P>Now, becau&s;e <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> would not omit any thing whereby he might attain the perfect knowledge of the place, he commanded his people to make the Tower of the whole, and &s;trictly &s;earch Hills, Dales, and Woods to &s;ee if they could di&s;cover ei|ther man or bea&s;t, commanding them if they found any they &s;hould bring them a live or dead: But they who were &s;ent on this errand found no living creature, but divers Birds of differing &s;orts, &s;hapes, and colours, who &s;uffered them&s;elves to be taken by the hand without any pain or trouble.</P>
<P><HI>Jean Gon&s;alve,</HI> e&s;teeming him&s;elf rich in &s;o ea&s;ie a purcha&s;e, returned aboard, where calling the chief|e&s;t of his Men to coun&s;el, it was re&s;olved they &s;hould not part from thence without a more particular examining the place&punc; which they had then lea&s;ure enough to do: Now becau&s;e the &s;hore was full of Rocks, which did not in many places &s;hew them&s;elves above the water, 'twas thought convenient to make further di&s;covery in their Shallops, as they had alrea|dy begun; than in their grearer Ve&s;&s;els, for fear &s;ome of the Currents might force them on the Rocks. So <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> taking the Shallop of his own Ve&s;&s;el, and committing the charge of the other to Captain

<HI>Alvare Alfons,</HI> they pa&s;&s;ed the point which was to|wards the We&s;t, &s;eeing four fair Rivulets run into the Sea, the water of which being extream clear and good, <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> cau&s;ed &s;ome bottles to be filled to carry to the Infant.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing &s;till on they &s;aw another Valley, which was likewi&s;e watered with a dainty Rivulet, here they they landed &s;ome Souldiers, who found no|thing, but a great many Fountains, and a huge grove of Trees, which grew together in form of an Arbor, on of the bigge&s;t whereof <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> took and made a great Cro&s;s of, &s;ince which this place is called <HI>Holy Cro&s;s,</HI> &s;ailing on they weathered a point of Land ex|tending it &s;elf farther than ordinary into the Sea, memorable for the many large Birds, the multitude of whom was &s;o great, that the men in the Shal|lop was fearful of being devoured by them, they therefore called this place <HI>Punt a dos Gralhos,</HI> a little further was another Valley full of Cedar Trees, which made a goodly &s;hew. On an adjacent Hill there grew one much higher than the re&s;t, which Na|ture &s;eemed to have &s;et there for a Beacon.</P>
<P>From this Valley of Cedars they came to another, where was a &s;patious Lake, which forming it &s;elf by the Sea-&s;ide into a large Ba&s;on or Pond, promi&s;ed &s;omething extraordinary; <HI>Gon&s;alve Ayvez</HI> was there|fore with a good number of Souldiers ordered to go a &s;hore; who, having by the Valley a&s;cended the Mountain, returned without any further knowledge then that by the Valley they could di&s;cover the place from whence they fir&s;t &s;et out, and thereby knew it to be an I&s;land, and no part of <HI>Africa,</HI> as many of them had before conjectured.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="17">
<HI>Gon&s;lave</HI> however not yet content, but &s;till ima|gining there might be yet &s;ome Inhabitants, ordered his people daily to go from place to place, to &s;ee if they could make any further di&s;coveries, by this means they found a very fair and large plain free from Trees (which covered in a manner all other places) and onely over-grown with mo&s;t beautiful Fennel, called in Portugueze <HI>Funchal,</HI> upon this Place afterwards was founded a Town, to which was given the name of <HI>Funchal,</HI> heretofore the Me|tropolis of the Ea&s;tern I&s;lands as to Spiritualities, and &s;till &s;o as to temporalities.</P>
<P>The Portugueze more mode&s;t than other Nati|ons, who vain-gloriou&s;ly give great Names to their Plantations and di&s;coveries; have alwayes been con|tented either to continue the old names of their Co|lonies, or if they gave them new appellations to be&s;tow &s;uch on them, as were mo&s;t agreeable to the nature of the Place, as for in&s;tance this famous City is called <HI>Funchal</HI> from the abundance of Fen|nel there found growing, before ever the Town was built.</P>
<P>Three large Rivers, having their Randevouze in this Valley, ju&s;t at di&s;embouging them&s;elves into the Sea, make two &s;mall I&s;lands, which do in a man|ner land lock the Haven, and &s;ecure the Port from the Wind and Sea, as if it were a Mole.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the great peace and tranquillity <HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> found, yet would he not permit his people to be idle, but alway bu&s;ied them in &s;ome employ|ment or other, he him&s;elf &s;till coa&s;ting the Country, came to a large Rock, which he called <HI>Praya Fermo&s;a,</HI> or the Fair Rock, becau&s;e of its greatne&s;s, and the

delicate water i&s;&s;uing thence, which gently break|ing its waves again&s;t the &s;tones made a &s;weet melo|dy. Pa&s;&s;ing &s;till on, they found between two points a furious Torrent, the waters whereof were &s;o clear, that it oblidged the curio&s;ity of them all to look thereon: In the company were two &s;ouldiers of <HI>Lagos,</HI> (for whom the General had a great e&s;teem) the&s;e being very &s;kilful in &s;wimming re&s;olved to pa&s;s the Torrent, but they were no &s;ooner in, but in &s;pight of all their re&s;i&s;tance they found them&s;elves carried down the &s;tream by the &s;trength and &s;wiftne&s;s of the current, and had undoubtedly there been drowned, had not their Companions &s;uccoured them. This adventure gave the Torrent the name of <HI>Soccorides</HI> more happily than that of <HI>Agravados</HI> was given to the Arabian Sea, of which our Hi&s;torians make men|tion.</P>
<P>Being now come again to Cape St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> by which ran a River, making the appearance of a Port, into it <HI>Gon&s;alve,</HI> with his Shallop entred, imagining he might there find &s;omewhat more of moment than hitherto he had &s;een, becau&s;e on the &s;and he thought he &s;aw the traces of certain Animals, which &s;earch|ing for, of a &s;udden, a great number Sea-wolves came ru&s;hing out of a hollow place, which they found at the bottom of a great Mountain, clo&s;e by the Sea. This concavity &s;erved the&s;e Creatures, as a den to which they retired them&s;elves, when they left the Sea. This being the mo&s;t remarkable thing they found in the I&s;land or their Voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Gon&s;alve</HI> afterwards took the name, and Title of <HI>Comerados Lobos,</HI> as <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Germanicus</HI> a&s;&s;umed theirs from the Provinces they conquered to the Ro|man
