<P>SOme other Rea&s;ons may be given for the publi&s;hing this Book in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> be&s;ides the Common Rea|&s;on of all <HI>Booksellers,</HI> which is the Im|provement of their Trade (there being hitherto nothing of this Subject in our Language) and they are the&s;e; &s;uch who have not been at <HI>Paris</HI> may here read of tho&s;e beauties which have ren|der'd that City (of late years e&s;pecially) &s;o famous: Others who have had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing what is here menti|oned, will not find it unplea&s;ant to re|fre&s;h their memory with the de&s;cripti|ons given in this Book. The lovers of tho&s;e two mo&s;t beautiful Si&s;ter-Arts, <HI>Painting</HI> and <HI>Sculpture,</HI> will be plea|&s;ed to read of the Excellent Perfor|mances in both kinds at <HI>Paris.</HI> It is real|ly the Incouragement which is given to
<PB REF="4">
the&s;e Arts, and their near Kin&s;woman <HI>Architecture,</HI> that makes a City Polite and Beautiful, advances an In-Land Trade, and makes Arti&s;ts &s;o &s;trive and vye with each other, till by degrees they arrive at the Perfection of the An|tients.

<HEAD>The AUTHOR's Adverti&s;ment.</HEAD>
<P>NO Man doubts that <HI>Paris</HI> is at pre&s;ent one of the greate&s;t and faire&s;t Cities of the World; the magnificence of her Buildings, her extent, and the almo&s;t infinite number of her Inha|bitants; among whom there are tho&s;e who for E&s;tates may compare with &s;ome Sove|reigns; and in &s;ine, the perpetual Concour&s;e of all Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> who come hither with an extream Affection to &s;tudy the <HI>French</HI> Behaviour, and ob&s;erve the Rarities of the Place: All the&s;e things concur to make it to be con&s;ider'd as a City that has no equal. Yet it happens very often, that all its true Beauties are not taken notice of by many per&s;ons, and principally the Strangers, who complain that they can never find them out without making it their particular &s;tudy, and giving them&s;elves a va&s;t trouble in the &s;earch, no De&s;cription having been hitherto Compo&s;ed to in&s;truct them in their Enqui|ries.
<PB REF="5">
It is for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to &s;a|tisfie the Curio&s;ity of Strangers that I have undertaken to de&s;cribe, by way of Abridg|ment, the mo&s;t noted Beauties of that fa|mous City. This De&s;cription will be the more u&s;eful unto them, in regard they may inform them&s;elves of the &s;everal Places here noted, and may view &s;everal Things which they would have pa&s;t by and neglect|ed, if they had not been admoni&s;h'd of them before hand. To make this work the more ea&s;ie and methodical, I have taken the &s;e|veral Quarters and Streets in order, as far as po&s;&s;ible, that &s;o the &s;everal Remarks may be &s;een as they lye.</P>
<P>I undertake not to make an exact de&s;cri|ption, that were almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be ef|fected, what endeavours &s;oever we make. I have therefore only collected tho&s;e things which are mo&s;t ob&s;ervable, and that which de&s;erves to be &s;een with &s;omewhat more than ordinary remark: Nor have I de&s;igned to &s;earch into Antiquities; for <HI>Giles Coro|zet,</HI> Father <HI>Bre&uuml;il,</HI> and &s;ome others have done that already, better than any can hope to do it after them; and to them I refer &s;uch as de&s;ire to know the Originals and Foundations of places. Tho&s;e Authors will acquaint you with the Epitaphs and Hi|&s;tories of Private Per&s;ons, which would have
<PB REF="5">
&s;welled this Volume con&s;iderably, if I &s;hould have tran&s;cribed them here. Be&s;ides, it &s;eems unnece&s;&s;ary for a Strangers knowledge to con&s;ider the&s;e things which &s;erve only as private Monuments, and are of no u&s;e to the publick Hi&s;tory, for which they Travel. They take more delight, without doubt, in the de&s;cription of a Cabinet, a Library, or an Apartment built after the modern way, than in reading the Epitaphs at <HI>Saint Inno|cents,</HI> or to pick out the meaning of them.</P>
<P>Without que&s;tion &s;ome will be &s;urprized to &s;ee me undertake a Work &s;o difficult as this, in &s;ight of &s;o many learned Per&s;ons abounding in <HI>Paris.</HI> But after all, if I prove not &s;ucce&s;sful herein, yet however I &s;hall e&s;teem it &s;ufficient glory, if I may in|&s;pire into any able Author the de&s;ign of a Work which may in &s;ome &s;ort an&s;wer to the Reputation of this great City.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as I may hereafter inform my &s;elf more particularly of &s;ome things which I have not hitherto been able to di&s;cover; at the &s;ame time I &s;hall be much obliged to tho&s;e, who have any parti|cular Memorials, if they will be &s;o generous to communicate, and thereof advertize the Bookseller who Prints this, that &s;o they may be con&s;ulted if they plea&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>A New DESCRIPTION OF The mo&s;t Remarkable things IN THE CITY OF PARIS.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I enter upon the matter, it may not be ami&s;s to &s;ay &s;omething of the Original of <HI>Paris.</HI> If this great City be not one of the Ancient|e&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet at lea&s;t &s;he may boa&s;t, that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;peaks advantagiou&s;ly of her in the &s;ixth Book of his Commentaries; where he &s;ays, that having &s;ubdued divers Nations among&s;t the <HI>Gauls,</HI> he was forced to lay Siege to <HI>Paris,</HI> which at that time was wholly enclo&s;ed between the two
<PB N="2" REF="7">
Arms of the <HI>Seine,</HI> into which place all the In|habitants of the Neighbouring Country were re|tired. Here they defended them&s;elves with &s;o much re&s;olution, and made &s;o &s;tout a Re&s;i&s;tance that he was con&s;trained to draw together all the Force he could to attack and fight them. It is true he &s;ubdued them, but it was not with|out much Labour, and after &s;everal bloody Fights; and in fine, to reduce them entirely to his Obe|dience and to keep 'em &s;o, he built the <HI>Great Ch&acirc;telet,</HI> and placed in it a &s;trong Garri&s;on. Not|with&s;tanding we read in other Hi&s;torians, that <HI>Ju|lian</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tate</HI> being retired among the <HI>Cauls</HI> (where he remain'd a long time in that part of <HI>Pa|ris</HI> which is now call'd the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Cluny)</HI> he built this Fortre&s;s, as a Check upon the People of tho&s;e Parts who were very unea&s;ie and apt to ri&s;e: after all we mu&s;t confe&s;s there is no great certainty of the&s;e things, by rea&s;on of the Ignorance of tho&s;e Ages that went before us, which have lo&s;t or de|&s;troy'd tho&s;e Memorials which &s;hould have infor|med us of the truth, had they been now in being.</P>
<P>As to the name of this Town; &s;ome &s;ay it was called <HI>Lutetia</HI> from King <HI>Luous,</HI> who was of great e&s;teem among the ancient <HI>Gauls;</HI> others, from the Latin word <HI>Lutum</HI> which &s;igni&s;ies Dirt and Mud; po&s;&s;ibly becau&s;e its Situation, being between the two Arms of a River, there was con|tinually plenty of Water and Dirt. And without doubt it is for this rea&s;on that the little &s;pace of Ground which lies at the further end of the <HI>Petit Pont,</HI> between the new &s;treet of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame,</HI> and the Street <HI>de la Calande,</HI> is at this day &s;till called <HI>le March&egrave; palud.</HI> Other Authors &s;ay, that the name <HI>Paris</HI> might well have been derived from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign"> which &s;ignifies Near,
<PB N="3" REF="7">
and from the Godde&s;s <HI>I&s;is</HI> who had formerly a Temple in that place where &s;tands at pre&s;ent the Church of St. <HI>Germain des prez;</HI> from which place <HI>Paris</HI> was not far di&s;tant. And the Village of <HI>I&s;&s;y</HI> near to <HI>Vaugerard</HI> might perhaps have al&s;o taken name from her, that Godde&s;s having had a Temple there, &s;erv'd by certain Prie&s;ts, for who&s;e maintenance the Lands that lay about that place were appropriated; which Lands belong at pre&s;ent to the Abbey of St. <HI>Genevi&eacute;ve du Mont.</HI> In the mean time <HI>I&s;is</HI> was not the only Deity that was Wor&s;hipp'd about <HI>Paris, Cybele</HI> had al&s;o her Temples there. To maintain which conjecture we may here take notice of the Di&s;covery which was made &s;ome years pa&s;t in the Garden of <HI>Mon|&s;ieur Berrier,</HI> in the Street called <HI>Coquilliere</HI> not far from the Church of St. <HI>Eu&s;tache.</HI> As they were digging there deeper than ordinary to make the foundation of a Wall, they di&s;covered the ruins of an old Tower, with a Bu&s;t of Bra&s;s, repre&s;ent|ing a Womans head &s;omething bigger than the Li&s;e, and Crowned with a Ca&s;tle compo&s;ed of four Towers, with the ancient &s;ort of Pinacles in &s;uch manner as we &s;ee 'em in the old Ba&s;s reliefs of <HI>Rome,</HI> or upon Medals repre&s;enting the God|de&s;s <HI>Cybele</HI> who was invoked for the fruit&s;ulne&s;s of the Earth, and whom the Poets called <HI>Turrita Mater.</HI> All Antiquaries who &s;aw this Piece did not in the lea&s;t que&s;tion its Antiquity. Among others the Reverend Father <HI>du Moulinet</HI> one of the Learned&s;t Men of the Kingdom in the&s;e things, has printed a &s;mall Tract to prove that this head might have &s;erv'd in &s;ome Temple built in this place where this Godde&s;s was adored. And even in the Library of S. <HI>Genevi&eacute;ve</HI> they pre&s;erve a Model of this Head taken off in Plai&s;ter with all the ex|actne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="8">
that could be from the Original, which is at pre&s;ent in the Cabinet of <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> the Pro|cureur-General <HI>de Harlay,</HI> which illu&s;trious Ma|gi&s;trate is perfectly acquainted with the true value of &s;uch curious things. There are other Etymo|logies be&s;ide the&s;e, as that of <HI>Paris</HI> King of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> who&s;e dominion extended round about the&s;e parts, from whence it comes as &s;ome &s;ay, that the Inhabitants of the Neigbouring Villages were called <HI>Pari&s;ii</HI> or <HI>Pari&s;iaci.</HI></P>
<P>It would be tedious to &s;peak of the &s;everal en|largements of this Town. It is ea&s;ily concluded that it was not always of the fame dimen&s;ions as it is at pre&s;ent. Under the Reign of <HI>Clouis</HI> it was as yet &s;hut up within the two Arms of the <HI>Seine,</HI> that is, that it took up no more ground than the <HI>I&s;le du Palais,</HI> which is that part which at pre|&s;ent we call the City, with &s;ome few hou&s;es on the Bank of the River next St. <HI>Germain l'Aux|erois;</HI> where was at that time a Wood called <HI>la Fore&s;t des Charbonniers.</HI> But however tho it was then but very little, it was con&s;idered as a Place of very great importance, &s;ince in that par|tition which the Sons of <HI>Clouis</HI> made of the King|dom, they agreed among them&s;elves that <HI>Paris</HI> &s;hould remain neuter and belong to neither of the four; further, that if any of them &s;hould enter there without permi&s;&s;ion of the other three, he &s;hould lo&s;e all the part which he might other|wi&s;e pretend to.</P>
<P>Under the &s;econd Race, the Town became a little more con&s;iderable: they began then to build on both &s;ides of the <HI>Seine:</HI> all about the Church of St. <HI>Genivi&eacute;ve,</HI> which <HI>Clouis</HI> had rai&s;ed: at the upper end of the <HI>Place-Maubert;</HI> where after|wards <HI>Charlemagne</HI> did di&s;po&s;e the Learned Men
<PB N="5" REF="8">
which he invited hither out of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> near St. <HI>Martins des Champs;</HI> and in divers other places in the Fields about the Town.</P>
<P>But under the third Race it was much more in|crea&s;ed. <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus</HI> cau&s;ed it to be paved throughout, and a certain Financier (or Exche|quer-Officer) called <HI>Girard de Pou&s;&s;y</HI> gave to this u&s;e out of his own proper Revenue 11000 Marks of Silver, and this he did freely without any con&s;traint from the King, in who&s;e Service he had doubtle&s;s attained this great Sum. This was an Example of Genero&s;ity altogether extra|ordinary; and was done in the year 1185. as <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Mezeray</HI> tells us in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>France.</HI> This King al&s;o cau&s;ed the &s;everal Quar|ters to be enclo&s;ed with Walls. Tho&s;e of the Uni|ver&s;ity extended from the edge of the <HI>Seine</HI> be|ginning at the Gate of St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> or the Gate of the <HI>Tournelle,</HI> and &s;o up behind St. <HI>Genivi&eacute;ve</HI> to the Gate of St. <HI>James,</HI> and then down again to|wards the River to the place where &s;tands at pre|&s;ent the Colledge of the four Nations, and where heretofore was the Gate of <HI>Ne&s;le</HI> taken down not long &s;ince to enlarge the Place. On the <HI>North</HI> &s;ide of the River it was al&s;o enclo&s;ed with Walls which had almo&s;t the &s;ame extent. There was in former times a Gate near the place where now &s;tands the <HI>Quinze-Vingts,</HI> which an&s;wered to an|other called the <HI>Porte-neuve,</HI> (or <HI>New-gate)</HI> on the Bank of the River pulled down &s;ome years ago, near which was a very high Tower: another Gate in the Street <HI>Coquilliere,</HI> at the end of the Street <HI>Grenelle:</HI> another in the Street of St. Denis, near the Fountain <HI>de la Reine,</HI> which was called the Painters Gate: another in the Street of S. <HI>Mar|tin,</HI> at the end of the Street <HI>aux Ours:</HI> and an|other
<PB N="6" REF="9">
near S. <HI>Johns</HI> Church-yard which was called the <HI>Porte Bodais,</HI> becau&s;e it led to the <HI>Ch&acirc;teau</HI> or Ca&s;tle of that name, which &s;tood in that place where now is the Village of St. <HI>Maur des Fo&s;&s;ez</HI> beyond <HI>Charenton.</HI> Since tho&s;e times this great City is much augmented, and continually extend|ed into the Fields, till not long &s;ince for &s;everal weighty Con&s;iderations, there have been certain Bounds pre&s;cribed, beyond which it is not lawful to rai&s;e any buildings. It is to be ob&s;erved that <HI>Paris</HI> being thus bounded, its extent is the more con&s;iderable, in regard there is not to be found in it any place that is not extreme full of People, and as thick of Hou&s;es as can be contrived, in &s;ome of which there are continually &s;everal di|&s;tinct Families in one hou&s;e, which is rarely to be &s;een in other Towns, where every one de&s;ires to dwell apart, and where there are few hou&s;es to be found of &s;even Stories high, as they are all about the <HI>Palais;</HI> near the great <HI>Chatelet;</HI> and round the place called <HI>la Halle;</HI> in which Hou&s;es the lea&s;t Rooms are full of Inhabitants and let out at dear Rates.</P>
<P>This is all that we &s;hall &s;ay of <HI>Paris</HI> in Gene|ral&punc; Let us now come to particulars.</P>

<P>Hi&s;torians &s;ay that this Palace was fir&s;t found|ed by <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus</HI> in the year 1214. Who made the great Tower, in which <HI>Ferrand</HI> Earl of <HI>Flanders</HI> was kept Pri&s;oner after that King had won the famous Battel of <HI>Bouvines;</HI> in which the Earl who had Revolted from King <HI>Philip</HI> was made a Captive. This Tower was &s;tanding in
<PB N="7" REF="9">
the la&s;t Age, and had &s;erved not only to keep the Kings Trea&s;ure, but al&s;o had been built to receive therein the Homage and Oath of Fidelity of tho&s;e who held Lands of the Crown; or rather, as one may pre&s;ume, it was the <HI>Seige Seigneurial</HI> (or Head of a Tenure) upon which &s;everal <HI>Fiefs</HI> did depend. For it is well known that our Ance&s;tors had a cu&s;tom always to build in their <HI>Ch&acirc;teaux</HI> (or Chief Seats) a great Tower, and to rai&s;e up|on that another le&s;&s;er, which they called the <HI>Don|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">on,</HI> this they e&s;teemed the Mark of a Seigneurie; and without doubt this Tower at the <HI>Louvre</HI> was of the &s;ame nature. It was taken down when <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t began that building which at pre&s;ent is called the old <HI>Louvre.</HI> But Death hin|dred that Prince from performing much of what he intended. <HI>Henry</HI> the Second his Son, carried on the building after the de&s;igns of his Father, and for the performance he made u&s;e of the Ab|bot of <HI>Clugny,</HI> and <HI>John Gougeon,</HI> both <HI>Pari&s;i|ans</HI> and the able&s;t Architects of their Time, &s;ince tho&s;e few things which we &s;ee of theirs pa&s;s for the mo&s;t regular and fine&s;t Architecture of the World. They were preferred to the illu&s;trious <HI>Seba&s;tian Sorlio,</HI> who was expre&s;ly &s;ent for from <HI>Italy,</HI> but had the di&s;plea&s;ure to &s;ee his de&s;igns not followed.

It is to be ob&s;erved that the middle of this Building, namely the great Pavilion, the two Terra&s;&s;es, and the two le&s;&s;er Pavilions at the Ends, were built at the char|ges of <HI>Katharine de Medicis,</HI> who was very skil|ful in Architecture, as we perceive by the&s;e Buil|dings, which are all of a mo&s;t curious proportion after the Ionick and Corinthian Orders, there are three Ranks of Pillars, with an Attick over head. For this work &s;he employed <HI>Philibert de Lorme</HI> and <HI>John Bulan,</HI> the prime Ma&s;ters of their Age. The re&s;t of the Buildings were performed by <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. who in our days hath repaired this Palace as we now &s;ee it.

by her immediately be&s;towed upon this Church. The other things mo&s;t remarkable in this Church are, the Tribune (or Gallery) of <HI>Germain Pi|lon</HI>'s de&s;igning, who was e&s;teemed in his Age the able&s;t Workman in all <HI>France</HI> for Sculpture and Architecture, and the Chappel of Mon&s;ieur the Marque&s;s <HI>de Ro&s;teing,</HI> in which are &s;ome Bu&s;ts in Marble of &s;everal illu&s;trious Per&s;ons of that Fa|mily. In the Room where the Churchwardens A&s;&s;emble hangs a very good copy of a La&s;t Supper, by <HI>Leonard de Vincy,</HI> whch Picture was former|ly placed in the Church and its Beauty never ob|&s;erved, till it was known that the Cavalier <HI>Ber|nin</HI> had admired it. Upon which it was quick|ly removed and placed in this Room, for the more choice keeping. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per&s;ons who have been interred in this Church are Mon&s;ieur <HI>Seguin,</HI> who was Dean here, very ju|dicious in the value of Medals: <HI>Joachim du Bel|lay,</HI> one of the famou&s;e&s;t Poets of his Age: Mon&s;ieur <HI>Varin,</HI> one of the able&s;t Gravers of Medals that <HI>France</HI> ever had; Mon&s;ieur <HI>Balin,</HI> a famous Gold&s;mith, of whom we have already &s;poken, this was he who invented tho&s;e Curious Ornaments where the Hi&s;tory of the Old and New Te&s;tament are repre&s;ented in Cartouches of admirable Workman&s;hip. Here is al&s;o the Tomb of Madamoi&s;elle <HI>Silve&s;tre</HI> repre&s;ented in Painting on a Black Marble fixed to a Pillar behind the Quire, after Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Bruns</HI> way. In the le&s;&s;er Chappels are to be &s;een &s;everal well e&s;teem|ed Pictures of <HI>le Sueur</HI>'s Work.</P>
<P>There is a Landskip in Per&s;pective done by <HI>Franci&s;que,</HI> worth &s;eeing, in one of the Hou&s;es in the Cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>In that great &s;pace of Ground which is between

the old Louvre and the Palace of the <HI>Tuilleries,</HI> are many fair Hou&s;es, among others</P>
<P>The <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Crequi,</HI> in which lives the Illu|&s;trious Mar&eacute;chal of that name. Its out&s;ide makes no great &s;hew, but within it is very well funi&s;hed: above all the Stair-ca&s;e extremely well de&s;ign'd. In the Street of St. <HI>Thomas du Louvre</HI> is</P>
<P>The <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Longueville</HI> formerly called the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Epernon,</HI> which wants a whole wing of Building. So much as is fini&s;hed is of a very beau|tiful de&s;ign, chiefly the Portal, of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Or|der, as is all the re&s;t of the Hou&s;e, which wants a Square or place before it, to give the more advan|tagious view. The Apartments are convenient, and the Garden plea&s;ant tho it be inclo&s;ed on eve|ry &s;ide. You mu&s;t not forget to &s;ee a Ceiling in one of the Chambers, painted by M. <HI>Mignard,</HI> high|ly e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Turn-again</HI>-Lane near this place &s;tands the Hou&s;e of M. <HI>de Guitry,</HI> which is very hand&s;om.</P>

<HEAD>The Quarter of St. <HI>Honor&egrave;.</HI></HEAD>
<P>This Quarter begins at the <HI>R&uuml;e de</HI> St. <HI>Denis,</HI> where we may &s;ee, in the fir&s;t place, a hand&s;om row of Hou&s;es, built uniform with the &s;ame Sy|metry, at the Charges of the Canons of St. <HI>Ger|main l'Auxerrois,</HI> who rai&s;e out of 'em a con|&s;iderable Revenue. This place hath been en|larged upon the Church-yard of the holy Inno|cents, which lies behind. The Charnel-hou&s;es which are built round that Church-yard, were built, as reported, out of the Confi&s;cate Goods of the Jews when they were expelled <HI>Paris</HI> under the Reign of <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus.</HI> In probability there is not any one place in the whole World in which more dead bodies are interred; which cau&s;ed the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador who re&s;ided in <HI>Paris</HI> during the League, to advi&s;e the Citizens at &s;uch time when the Famine pre&s;&s;ed them cruelly, to grind the Bones of the dead in this Church-yard to make Bread; but this Coun&s;el was not followed com|ing from a drolling <HI>Spaniard:</HI> M. <HI>de Mezeray,</HI> &s;o well known of the Learned for his delicate Hi&s;to|ry of <HI>France,</HI> is here Interred. You may &s;ee in this Place a Pyramid adorn'd with Ba&s;s-releifs, much e&s;teemed, on the top of which is erected a Cro&s;s, this was &s;et up in the la&s;t Age during the horrible Confu&s;ions of the League. There is in the &s;ame place a Skeleton of the Workman|&s;hip of <HI>Permain Philon.</HI> Further on, is</P>
<P>The Cro&s;s <HI>du Tiro&uuml;er</HI> where, as it is &s;aid, Queen <HI>Grunehault</HI> was, by the Command of <HI>Clotaire,</HI> drawn at the Tail of a Wild hor&s;e.
<PB N="25" REF="18">
But this is not well proved: and it is much di&s;pu|ted among the Hi&s;torians, whether this Queen was the mo&s;t illu&s;trious, or the mo&s;t wicked of her Age. For there are as many that &s;peak well of her, as ill. St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the Great, Pope; <HI>Gre|gory</HI> of <HI>Tours, Fortunatus</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Poictiers, Paulus Aemilius, du Tillet,</HI> the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Meaux,</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;quier</HI> in his Enquiries of <HI>France,</HI> are all full of her Encomiums. Tho&s;e who condemn her are <HI>Aimoin, Gaguin,</HI> Mini&s;ter-general of the <HI>Mathurins, Belle-Fore&s;t, du Hail|lant,</HI> and <HI>Vigner,</HI> who&s;e Authorities are of great force in Hi&s;tory. So that it will be difficult to affirm any thing po&s;itively of this great Prince&s;s, who has been more &s;poken of than ever any Queen of <HI>France</HI> hath been. Something lower are</P>
<P>The <HI>Fathers of the Oratory,</HI> who&s;e hou&s;e &s;tands in the &s;ame place where formerly was the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Bouchages.</HI> Tho their Church is not yet quite fini&s;hed, it is however already extreme hand&s;om, and of a de&s;ign very Regular. They have here on their great Altar a Tabernacle of a magnifick &s;ort of Architecture, the Pillars are of an admirable <HI>Sicilian</HI> Marble. It is a Dome rai&s;ed very high with four Porticoes, &s;upported with &s;ix Pillars of the compo&s;ite order which &s;tand out from the Work; the Ornaments of which are perfectly well wrought, and the Proportions ex|act. A great Fabrick after this Model might well plea&s;e the mo&s;t difficult Per&s;ons in matters of Architecture. The Cardinal <HI>de Berulle</HI> is Inter|red in one of the Cha pels, where his Tomb may be &s;een, and on it his repre&s;entation in white Marble. He was their Founder, as all men know. The&s;e Fathers have a very hand&s;om Library. The

<P>In a Hall belonging to this Palace is the Thea|tre where they repre&s;ent the <HI>Opera</HI> of famous M. <HI>de Lully,</HI> which draws to it continually a mighty concour&s;e of People lovers of Mu&s;ick. No part of <HI>Europe</HI> yields more plea&s;ing Objects, be it for the Dances, or for the Symphonie, or in fine, for the &s;ingularity of the Habits; but that which is mo&s;t con&s;iderable, is the wonder|ful agreement of the <HI>French</HI> Mu&s;ick with the <HI>Italian,</HI> which was once thought a thing impo&s;&s;i|ble, and yet even in this M. <HI>de Lully</HI> hath been mighty &s;ucce&s;sful. Nor has the Age been un|grateful to his extraordinary Parts, for he draws a very great Revenue from the Repre&s;entations of the&s;e Pieces.

<P>In a lower Gallery they keep a many Bu&s;ts and ancient Statues which the King hath &s;ent for out of <HI>Italy.</HI> There is a very con&s;iderable number of them which are placed in Ranks one degree higher than another as in an Amphitheater; in which place there &s;tands al&s;o a Model in Plai&s;ter of that beautiful Pillar which the Roman Senate Con&s;ecrated to the Memory of the Emperor <HI>Tra|jan,</HI> which is the be&s;t Monument that remains of the ancient Grandeur of <HI>Rome:</HI> by this we may &s;ee the Perfection to which the Ancients had brought the Art of de&s;igning. The King cau&s;ed this Model to be made at a very great expence: It hath co&s;t near two hundred thou&s;and Franks. <HI>Francis</HI> I. had made the &s;ame thing with a de&s;ign to have rai&s;ed &s;uch another Pillar at <HI>Fontainebleau;</HI> but Death preventing&punc; the Stones <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ay by neglect|ed, and were after made u&s;e of to build a &s;table. M. <HI>Felibien</HI> hath the care and over&s;ight of the&s;e things, to place them in their proper &s;tations. No man under&s;tands the&s;e matters better than him&s;elf, as appears &s;ufficiently by his Works. We &s;hall &s;ay in its proper place how much the Learn|ed are obliged to him for tho&s;e Books with which he has enrich'd the Publick, as his Dictionary of the Arts; his lives of the Painter, which he has publi&s;hed in four Volumes, perfectly well writ, be&s;ides which we have hardly any thing on that Subject in our Language: with &s;everal other pieces on divers &s;ubjects of Archi tecture and Painting.</P>

The other Academy e&s;tabli&s;hed in this <HI>Palais Brion</HI> is that of Architecture, which takes up all the Apartments at the further end of the Court. This Academy the King erected in the year 1672. and placed it under the Authority of the Super|intendant of the Buildings, of which the illu&s;tri|ous Mon&s;ieur <HI>Blondel</HI> is the Director. Who had the honour to teach the Mathematicks to the Dauphin, of whom we &s;hall &s;peak more at large when we come to treat of his Cabinet. It is he al&s;o who makes the publick Lectures of Archi|tecture in this place. The Hall where the Mem|bers of this Academy a&s;&s;emble is adorned with curious de&s;igns, and one may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h from the re&s;t, the Model which the Chevalier <HI>Bernin</HI> made of the <HI>Louvre</HI> when the King &s;ent for him from <HI>Rome</HI> on this account.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Court is placed a Hor&s;e of Bra&s;s a little bigger than the life. This the King cau&s;ed to be brought from <HI>Nancy.</HI> It &s;tands upon a Pede&s;tal, and remains here till it be re|moved to &s;ome place where it may be more ex|po&s;ed to publick View.</P>
<P>When you go from hence you ought to vi&s;it the Hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Fo&s;&s;e,</HI> who dwells cro&s;s the way: here you may &s;ee &s;everal Pieces of Painting in his way, much e&s;teemed.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve as you go that the <HI>R&uuml;e de Richelieu</HI> for the length, and for the beauty of the Hou&s;es, which are all built in a &s;trait Line, is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and regular Streets of <HI>Paris.</HI> It takes its name from the great Cardinal <HI>de Riche|lieu,</HI> who during his Mini&s;try, cau&s;ed it to be con&s;iderably enlarged, and the Gate to be made at the end which leads out of Town on the &s;ide next <HI>Montmartre.</HI> In the &s;ame Street the&s;e

<P>As you go forward you come to the hou&s;e of M. <HI>Mignard,</HI> who has by him many Curio&s;ities. From thence you go to</P>
<P>The <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Jarz,</HI> &s;o called from a Com|mander of <HI>Malta,</HI> who bought the Ground of the Abbot of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> and built it. It is one of the be&s;t Works of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Man&s;ard</HI> for de|&s;ign.</P>
<P>The Gate is a curious piece, and the Stair-ca&s;e is very light, and con&s;equently plea&s;ant: The Apartments are large and high. But to &s;ay the Truth, they are not &s;o convenient as beautiful. On the Garden &s;ide are contrived two &s;mall Ca|binets (or Clo&s;ets) &s;upported with Pillars with much Art and Indu&s;try, but they are two &s;mall for the bigne&s;s of the Pillars which &s;upport them.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this is the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Louvois:</HI> there are many things to be taken notice of in this hou&s;e, but more e&s;pecially the Stair-ca&s;e, and the Room of Audience. As for the Apartments they are contrived to the be&s;t advantage, and no man can de&s;ire better Furniture than is &s;een here.
<PB N="41" REF="26">
Rich Tapi&s;try, Branches for Candles, Tables, Looking-gla&s;&s;es of Silver, Embroidered Beds, and in fine, all that can contribute to magnificence and neatne&s;s, may be here &s;een, every thing in its proper place. The face of the Building on the Garden &s;ide, and that next the Court corre&s;pond and are both of a curious Symetry. You mu&s;t not neglect to ob&s;erve as you pa&s;s, the Locks on the doors, which are very finely wrought, and kept with &s;uch care that they &s;hew like Silver.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t this <HI>H&ocirc;tel</HI> is a long Gallery, in which was formerly kept the Library of Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> at pre&s;ent in the College of the four Nations. The Stable was underneath. The Duke of <HI>Nevers</HI> u&s;es the Chambers that are at the end, where you may &s;ee &s;ome Ceiling pieces well Painted. Of late this Gallery hath been broken through, to make room for a new &s;treet that runs cro&s;s from the <HI>R&uuml;e Vivien</HI> to the <HI>R&uuml;e de Richelieu,</HI> to which they have given the name of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Colbert.</HI></P>
<P>At the further end of the <HI>R&uuml;e de Richelieu</HI> you come into the Street of S. <HI>Augu&s;tin,</HI> &s;o called from the Religious men of that Saints Order, other|wi&s;e called <HI>les petits Peres</HI> (the little Fathers) who&s;e hou&s;e &s;tands at the end and takes up part of this Street.</P>
<P>In this Street are many very fair hou&s;es. About three or four years &s;ince the Sieur <HI>Douilly</HI> Receiver of the Generalty of <HI>Poitiers,</HI> built one over again&s;t the Nuns of S. <HI>Thomas,</HI> on which he hath laid out one hundred thou&s;and Crowns: there is nothing wanting but a little more Room, but it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to have allotted more to the Work, it being &s;hut up between the <HI>Petits-peres,</HI> and the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e Vivien.</HI> Otherwi&s;e all is hand&s;om. The Stair-ca&s;e
<PB N="42" REF="27">
is very light and large, and the Gate contri|ved after the manner of a Vault is very well pro|portioned; I &s;ay nothing of the Moveables, for one may well conclude that a hou&s;e which appears &s;o well without, wants for no Furniture, and that the beauty within is equal to that on the out|&s;ide.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Street &s;tands the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Gra|mont.</HI> This Hou&s;e hath for a long time been ju&s;tly e&s;teemed one of the faire&s;t of <HI>Paris.</HI> It did once belong to the Sieur <HI>Monerot,</HI> who &s;pa|red no Co&s;t to make it Glorious. And it &s;till pre&s;erves its Beauty, for its Furniture is mo&s;t magnificent, &s;ince it came to the Duke of <HI>Gramont.</HI> It looks towards <HI>Montmartre</HI> which renders its &s;ituation extreme plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>Near this is the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Grant&egrave;,</HI> not all out &s;o magnificent, but very commodious and plea|&s;ant, becau&s;e of its Garden which is one of the neate&s;t of <HI>Paris,</HI> the abode of the Mare&s;chal of that name. This <HI>H&ocirc;tel</HI> did once belong to the Sieur <HI>Thevenin,</HI> who was a very curious per|&s;on.</P>
<P>Not far from hence is the <HI>Hou&s;e of St. Cotte-Blanche.</HI> Here was formerly a very good Libra|ry: and it was once adorned with very good Fur|niture and curious Pictures, but its Ma&s;ter having changed his Fortune, all the&s;e things are now di&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hou&s;e of M. Fremont,</HI> and &s;everal others that look upon the Fields, are not unplea&s;ant.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of M. <HI>de Bois-Franc,</HI> Intendant of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> which is on the other &s;ide of the Street, is one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed things that can be &s;een. The face of the Building next the Court is extreme regular, &s;et off with a kind

of Portico who&s;e Pillars are of the <HI>Ionick</HI> Order, with Va&s;es on the top done about with Fe&s;tons and other Ornaments, all which give you a plea|&s;ing object as you enter. Round about the Court are Bu&s;ts of Emperors placed between the Arches that &s;upport the Building. The Stair-ca&s;e is very &s;pacious, with a Balu&s;trade of Wood painted like white Marble, and wrought with a great deal of de&s;ign. The <HI>Ba&s;-reliefs</HI> on the Doors of the &s;e|veral Apartments, tho they be but of Plai&s;ter, are notwith&s;tanding very Ornamental. There is al&s;o in this Hou&s;e a Cabinet (or Clo&s;et) of very choice Books.

As for printed Books, there is no rare piece that can be heard of&punc; but you may find here a Copy. Here are &s;everal very ancient Manu&s;cripts of St. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">prian,</HI> which <HI>Cathe|rine de Medicis</HI> brought with her, as al&s;o divers other very &s;carce Books, out of the famous Li|brary of <HI>Laurence de Medicis.</HI> There are al&s;o &s;ome pieces of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>France,</HI> which have been Collected very particularly and are kept here with great care. The Duke of <HI>Bethune,</HI> hath compo&s;ed a con&s;iderable number touching the mo&s;t important Negotiations which have been from the time of <HI>Francis</HI> I. to the Mini|&s;try of Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu.</HI> All the&s;e Volumes are curiou&s;ly bound in Turkie-Leather of a Flame-colour, gilt, and the Kings Arms on the Covers. Books of Prints have here al&s;o their proper places, of which there are here &s;everal great Volumes Collected by Mon&s;ieur the Abbot <HI>Marolles,</HI> the mo&s;t curious per&s;on of his time, in the&s;e matters.

Here are al&s;o &s;everal Ancient Volumes of Limnings or Miniatures, well and carefully pre&s;erved, in which one may remarque the &s;ingularity of the Habits of our Ance&s;tors, and their odd fancies in de&s;igning; but the mo&s;t

beautiful things of this kind are certain Collecti|ons of Animals and Plants, de&s;ign'd upon Vellum, after the life, by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Robert,</HI> who hath la|boured a long time to render this Work com|pleat as we now &s;ee it.

<P>Books are not the only Curio&s;ity to be &s;een in this place. The Medals here are one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Trea&s;ures.

<P>But one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ingular Rari|ties of this Cabinet, in the Judgment of all men, is the Tomb of <HI>Childeric</HI> the fourth King of <HI>France,</HI> who lived in the year 458. and was the immediate Predece&s;&s;or of <HI>Clouis.</HI> This Monu|ment was di&s;covered at <HI>Tournay</HI> in the year 1653. As certain Workmen were digging near the Ca|thedral Church in an old Burial-place in order to lay a Foundation for a Sacri&s;ty; they fir&s;t di&s;co|vered the skeliton of a Hor&s;es Head, and after that near the &s;ame place a long Stone in nature of a Tomb, which Stone the Workmen were fain to break before they could remove it; But they were &s;urpri&s;ed to find under it the Bones of a Man all lying in their natural and pro|per &s;ituation. Curio&s;ity urging them to exa|mine this di&s;covery &s;till further, they found among the Bones a good quantity of Greek Medals of Gold, of the latter Empire, with a great num|ber of Flies of the &s;ame metal, with their wings half open, and enamelled with Cornelian. The noi&s;e of this &s;pread over the Town immediately, and the Canons of the Cathedral Church came to the place to con&s;ider what the&s;e things might di&s;cover.

The Grandeur of the Building, the number of the Pillars which in truth are a little too thick crowded together, and the heighth of the Roof, with the Chappels that are round it, con&s;idered altogether, render this Edifice Maje|&s;tick. Among other things the two Chappels which are on each &s;ide of the great Gate ought to be ob&s;erved.

<P>Near St. <HI>Eu&s;tache</HI> is the great Market called <HI>la Halle</HI> which place ought to be avoided as much as may be, becau&s;e of the continual Crowd of People that frequent it.

And at pre&s;ent the <HI>Italian</HI> Comedians are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this Hou&s;e, &s;ince the union of the two Companies of French Players, which the King cau&s;ed three or four years ago. This Thea|tre is perhaps one of the Anciente&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> for it is thought that there have been publick Shows in this place &s;ix hundred years ago. In former times Comedies were only repre&s;ented by wandring Companies of Pilgrims of the holy Sepulchre of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who were &s;ince called <HI>Jongleurs.</HI> The&s;e having no certain Re&s;idence u&s;ed at the corners of Streets, to relate the Adventures which they had met with in their Travels, and People being concerned at their &s;tories, and com|mi&s;erating the &s;everal dangers they had pa&s;&s;ed through, would give them very liberally con&s;ide|rable Alms. The ancient Dukes of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> &s;eeing People take &s;ome plea&s;ure in hearing them, he gave them a Room in his <HI>H&ocirc;tel,</HI> where all people might come and hear them with better conveniency than in the Street. But in time, the&s;e Ma&s;ters of devout Subjects degenerated into profane Tales, and in effect &s;o very profane that they became meer Farces and very irregular re|pre&s;entations. In &s;uch &s;ort that Chri&s;tianity could

<P>Near this is another Hou&s;e belonging to the <HI>Sieur Rolland,</HI> built after the de&s;igns of Mon&s;ieur <HI>des Argues</HI> a famous Architect: by the outward appearance you may ea&s;ily conclude that it be|longs to one of an excellent Judgment.

The <HI>Croi&s;ades</HI> (or Pilgrimages to the Holy Land) being cea&s;ed, by rea&s;on of the Turks general In|va&s;ion in all parts of <HI>Pale&s;tine,</HI> the&s;e Knights who&s;e In&s;titution was to conduct the Pilgrims to the Holy Places, thought them&s;elves excu&s;ed from that Office any longer, in which there was &s;uch apparent Danger: Hereupon they ama&s;&s;ed up va&s;t Riches, and withal became &s;o proud and di&s;&s;o|lute, that as Hi&s;torians &s;ay, Pope <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ement</HI> V. and <HI>Philip</HI> the fair agreed together to ruin and utterly aboli&s;h the whole Order, as a puni&s;hment for their Crimes and &s;candalous Debauchery.

<P>It is reported, but with no great a&s;&s;urance, that at the in&s;tant of their Execution, <HI>Molay,</HI> who was the great Ma&s;ter, cited the Pope and the King to appear before God in a years time. Whether this Circum&s;tance be true or not, certain it is that the Pope died in le&s;s then forty days and the King hardly lived to the years end.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="47">
From that time the Temple came to the Kings po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by Confi&s;cation, who for &s;ome time kept here their Court, but afterwards gave it to the Knights Ho&s;pitallers of St. <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI> who at la&s;t made this their Provincial Hou&s;e, for the French Province. Mon&s;ieur the <HI>Com|mandeur de Vendome,</HI> is at pre&s;ent Grand Prior, which brings him yearly a Revenue of above 20000 Crowns. This place is very &s;pacious, in|clo&s;ed about by ancient Walls; &s;upported with Towers; the Hou&s;e which the Grand Prior inhabits, was built of late time by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Souvray</HI> Grand Prior al&s;o; he was Son of the Mare&s;chal <HI>de Souvray,</HI> Governor to <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. But death prevented him from compleating the Edifice; &s;o much as is done is of the de&s;ign of the Sieur <HI>de Li&s;le,</HI> an able Architect, who had built quite round the Court, and made a Gallery &s;up|ported by Pillars, of which we &s;ee the beginning, had the Ma&s;ter lived; the Lodgings are at the further end of this Court, with two Stair-ca&s;es in the two Pavilions of the two Wings.

<P>Within the inclo&s;ure of the Temple you ought to &s;ee the hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fremont de Ablan|cour,</HI> a Jeweller. Formerly there were many Jewellers who inhabited in this place, and made counterfeit Jewels very neatly, but of late years they have not been admitted to be here any lon|ger. Yet it is &s;till to be ob&s;erved that all the Arti&s;ts who work here are exempt from the Ju|ri&s;diction of the City Companies.

The fir&s;t door you come at gives you a pattern of all the re&s;t: It is adorned with Statues, the Joiners Work it &s;elf is wrought with very good Bas-reliefs, and the Locks are of very curious and particular Art. The Court is in truth &s;omething of the lea&s;t, but the Entry or pa&s;&s;age on the right hand is extraordinary. It is adorned with Pillars and Bu&s;ts, and paved with Marble. Still the Stair|ca&s;e is more beautiful yet.

The Parquet of the E&s;tade is of inlaid Work, where in the middle among di|vers Ornaments are the Arms of the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e. On the left hand is the Chappel, which is in Truth but little, but to make amends, it is adorned as much as po&s;&s;ible with all things con|venient. The Pictures that are in it are painted by very good Ma&s;ters. On the right hand you enter into the Cabinet, the la&s;t Room of this Apartment, and the mo&s;t beautiful of all.

<P>They are Magnificent both without and within, and &s;hew very great; but that which is mo&s;t remarkable is the great Gate that leads to the Park, of the &s;ame Order, together with the Sta|tues that &s;tand on each &s;ide which are very beau|tiful. The Chappel was founded by <HI>Charles</HI> V. and the Body of Mon&s;ieur the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> who died here, is repo&s;ited in this Chappel, till that of the Colledge of the four Nations be fini&s;h|ed, in which will be rai&s;ed a Monument for him, as he has ordered in his Will. You ought to take particular notice of the curious Windows in this Chappel, they being highly e&s;teemed, in regard neither <HI>Italy</HI> nor any other parts el&s;ewhere can equal them. Many Kings have made their abode here. St. <HI>Lewis</HI> who u&s;ed oftentimes to deve&s;t him&s;elf of the State and pre&s;s of his Attendants at Court, that he might have the greater freedom to exerci&s;e his Piety, would here pa&s;s his days of retreat. It is &s;aid that not long ago there was remaining in the Park a great old Oak, under which this good Prince was u&s;ed to hear their Complaints who re&s;orted to him for Ju&s;tice; and that he him&s;elf would u&s;e to &s;end abroad his Heralds about the Country to call in all &s;uch who had any need of his Authority again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;i|on of great men.

In the middle of this Building is a Hall that opens to all the four &s;ides, and parts the whole into four Divi&s;ions. The Beauty of the Buildings is equal on the Garden, and on that of the Court. The Garden is great enough and very carefully kept. Strangers ought not to neglect to &s;ee the&s;e two hou&s;es, for it is certain they can hardly &s;ee finer, and where the beauties of Modern Architecture have been ob&s;er|ved with more care and Judgment.

After his death his Body was brought to their Church, and was interred in a Chappel which he had cau&s;ed to be built for him&s;elf and his Fami|ly. Before we enter into this Church we ought to pa&s;s through the little Cloi&s;ter, which is ex|actly &s;quare, and built very neatly. It is all Vaulted and adorned with Sculpture. The Pillars that &s;upport the Arches have their Capitals ex|tremely well wrought. This is a Work of the la&s;t Age, and had it been done in this it would have co&s;t much more than it did, for it is &s;aid that the whole expence did not exceed 29000 Francs.

<P>The Church belonging to the&s;e Fathers is all Gothick and hath nothing Curious in relation to its Structure. The Altar is not much better a|dorned: yet on the Fe&s;tival days they expo&s;e here very rich Ornaments of an ancient &s;ort of Stuff of Gold and Silver Embroidered, by who&s;e Beau|ty we may perceive that in the Ages pa&s;t they had very indu&s;trious Arti&s;ts, and &s;uch who had a delicate Gu&s;t in the&s;e matters. The Kings Se|cretaries hold their Confraternity in this Church. Their Company is one of the famou&s;e&s;t that is, as well for the number of con&s;iderable per&s;ons that compo&s;e it, as the great Priviledges which their Office gives them, one of the faire&s;t of which is the Title of Nobility. They have a black Pall, the riche&s;t that is to be &s;een; made by an <HI>Italian</HI> whom Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> cau&s;ed to come into
<PB N="136" REF="74">
this Kingdom expre&s;ly, to de&s;ign the Embroide|ry which he intended to make. This Pall is of black Velvet with a great Cro&s;s of Silver, and Cartouches about the edges, in which there are &s;everal devi&s;es delicately wrought.</P>
<P>You ought next to &s;ee the Tombs which are in the <HI>Chapelle de Orleans.</HI> As you go in, on the left hand you may ob&s;erve a great twi&s;ted Pillar, of white Marble, adorned with <HI>Fe&uuml;illages</HI> and Mouldings let into the Work, as is al&s;o the Capi|tal which is of the Compo&s;ite Order; Over which is placed an Urn of Bra&s;s, and in that the heart of the Con&s;table <HI>Anne de Montmorency,</HI> who died gloriou&s;ly of his Wounds received at the Bat|tel of St <HI>Dennis,</HI> which he fought again&s;t the <HI>Hugonots</HI> on the fourteenth of <HI>November</HI> in the year 1567. This brave Lord received &s;ix &s;everal Wounds, of which the la&s;t only was mor|tal. It is reported of him that being in the Agony of Death, a Cordelier exhorting him to his la&s;t Duties with &s;omething too much Violence and Importunity, he de&s;ired him to permit him to re&s;t a little, &s;aying that he had not lived four&s;core years, and not yet learnt what it was to die one quarter of an hour. His Funeral Pomp was Magnificent, and equal to that of Kings, his E&s;fi|gies being carried as is cu&s;tomary at the Ob&s;equies of Kings or their Children. This beautiful Pillar is erected upon a Pede&s;tal of red Marble, and &s;et off with three Statues of Bra&s;s repre&s;enting three Virtues. The Sword Royal of which the Con|&s;table hath the Charge with the other Marque&s;s of that Dignity are al&s;o here repre&s;ented in Marble. You may here read certain In&s;criptions in French Ver&s;e, which at that time were much e&s;teemed but I have omitted to in&s;ert them in this Work, they
<PB N="137" REF="74">
being not at all of the Gu&s;t of this Age. This Monument is one of the mo&s;t beautiful and &s;in|gular that is to be &s;een, the work of the Pillar is exqui&s;ite, and it is &s;aid that the Sculptor was more than fifteen years in making it. The Body of this great Con&s;table is in the Church of <HI>Mont|morency,</HI> four Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> where hath been rai&s;ed for him one of the &s;tatelie&s;t Mau|&s;oleums of all the Kingdom, of which we may &s;ay more hereafter.</P>
<P>In the middle of this Chappel &s;tands the Tomb of the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> for whom it was parti|cularly erected, It hath nothing magnificent; only the repre&s;entation of four per&s;ons in cum|bent po&s;tures, namely of <HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Orle|ans,</HI> who was murdered; and of <HI>Valentine</HI> his Wife, who died two years after her Husband of Grief and Sorrow, having done her utmo&s;t en|deavours to be revenged upon the Duke of <HI>Bur|gundy</HI> for his Treachery, by drawing into her quarrel the Dauphin <HI>Charles,</HI> tho again&s;t his own Mother, and the Parliament who cited the Duke to appear per&s;onally before them. The Clergy and the Univer&s;ity did commi&s;erate her Sorrows, and did their endeavours, tho un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to comfort her. <HI>France</HI> is obliged to this Prince&s;s for that inconte&s;table Right &s;he hath to the Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> which &s;he brought by her Marriage with the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> from whom <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. and <HI>Francis</HI> I de&s;cended. She was daughter of <HI>John Galeas</HI> Duke of <HI>Millain,</HI> who left two Sons, but both dying without i&s;&s;ue Male, this Prince&s;s became Pre&s;umptive Heir to that Dutchy.

All the&s;e four Figures are of Marble, and were cau&s;ed to be made by the pious care of <HI>Lewis</HI> XII. who for the mildne&s;s of his Reign and the great fa|vour and love which he had for his Subjects does merit to be called <HI>the Father of his People,</HI> a Title the more illu&s;trious, by rea&s;on that the Empe|ror <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and the greate&s;t Kings of the Earth were ambitious to de&s;erve it. At one end of this Tomb, next the Altar, is placed the heart of <HI>Henry</HI> II. in an Urn of Bra&s;s gilt, held up by three Vertues upon their heads, which Statues are of Marble, and the be&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Germain Pi|ton's</HI> Work. Men of Judgment admire this Piece for the Beauty of the De&s;ign. And it is &s;aid that a curious Per&s;on of the la&s;t Age offered to give for it 10000 Crowns and a Copy of the &s;ame to be made as exactly as could be and placed in the Room. The Pede&s;tal of the&s;e three Figures, which properly &s;peaking are but one, is triangu|lar like a <HI>Tripos.</HI> They are as big as the Life, of one Block of Marble, and hold together by the hands. Their Drapery and the air of their heads, is admirable. One may ea&s;ily perceive by this
<PB N="139" REF="75">
that the pa&s;t age did equal ours in delicate Work|man&s;hip, and Beauty of De&s;ign.</P>
<P>At the other end is the heart of <HI>Francis</HI> II. on a high Pillar of white Marble. Flames &s;eem to i&s;&s;ue out at the top, about this Pillar are three Cupids with their Torches rever&s;t and extingui&s;h|ed. This is rai&s;ed upon a Pede&s;tal of Porphyry, on the &s;ides of which are certain In&s;criptions, among others one that &s;ays that this King marri|ed <HI>Mary Stuart,</HI> who was beheaded in <HI>England</HI> through the Jealou&s;ie of <HI>Elizabeth.</HI> He died at <HI>Orleans, Decemb.</HI> 10. 1560. being but &s;ixteen years of Age. The heart of Charles IX. his Brother, who died at <HI>Vincennes</HI> on <HI>Whit-&s;unday</HI> in the year 1572. is al&s;o in the &s;ame Monument.</P>
<P>Along the Wall on the right hand, is the Tomb of a Prince&s;s, who was &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Valentine</HI> of <HI>Milain;</HI> that of the Admiral <HI>Chabot,</HI> the Work|man&s;hip of <HI>Paul Ponce,</HI> who&s;e Labours are migh|tily e&s;teemed; and that of one of the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Rohan.</HI> The&s;e two la&s;t Tombs tho of a different &s;ort, are very beautiful, and the Effigies of tho&s;e who are there interred are well de&s;igned. Near the door which leads out of this Chappel into the Nave of the Church, &s;tands a great Pillar of white Marble full of Cyphers and Sculptures, and belongs to the illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Co&s;&s;&eacute;-Bri&s;&s;ac,</HI> as appears by the Epitaph. It was rai&s;ed for <HI>Timoleon de Co&s;&s;&eacute;-Bri&s;&s;ac.</HI> But that which is mo&s;t remarkable in this Chappel, and that which &s;trikes the eye with mo&s;t &s;urprize, is the Curious Pyramid belonging to the hou&s;e of <HI>Longueville,</HI> the Workman-&s;hip of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Augui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">rre,</HI> in which are the hearts of &s;everal per&s;ons of that illu&s;trious Family, it is adorned with Trophies and accompanied with four Vertues of

White Marble. On the Pede&s;tal are two Ba&s;-reliefs gilt over, repre&s;enting two of the mo&s;t remarka|ble Actions of the Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> for whom this Monument was erected at a very con|&s;iderable expence. You ought to ob&s;erve the Picture over the Altar, it being done by <HI>Francis Salujati,</HI> a <HI>Boulonois,</HI> who was a famous Pain|ter, and who&s;e Works are much &s;ought after in <HI>Italy.</HI> Behind this Chappel is another little one, which Mon&s;ieur the Marque&s;s of <HI>Ro&s;taing</HI> cau&s;ed to be built, but in it there is nothing to invite the Curious. In the Nave of this Church is a Tomb belonging to the Ance&s;tors of the Duke of <HI>Ge&s;vres,</HI> where you will &s;ee &s;ome Statues of Marble, kneeling, in the habits of that Age, very well wrought, but more e&s;pecially that of the Duke of <HI>Tremes,</HI> his Father. In one of the Chappels is the Monument of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de la Tremo&uuml;ille,</HI> and over again&s;t that the Tomb of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Zamet,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Langres,</HI> on one &s;ide of which you may &s;ee the Monument of <HI>Ca|rolus Magnus;</HI> he is repre&s;ented &s;itting and lean|ing his head on his left arm. This is the Work of <HI>Paul Ponce</HI> a famous Sculptor, as we have already &s;aid. In that Chappel where you &s;ee the Tomb of the Duke <HI>de la Tremo&uuml;ille,</HI> there is over the Altar a very curious piece of a <HI>Magdelain</HI> done by <HI>Mignard,</HI> Nephew of <HI>Peter Mignard</HI> whom we have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;e it &s;elf there is nothing of Curio|&s;ity. The&s;e Fathers have begun a great Building of late time, which is now almo&s;t fini&s;hed, where|in they will be extreme conveniently lodged. Their Gardens are hand&s;om enough, in one of which near the Vineyard, you may &s;ee a Grotto of Shell-work, which is committed to the care

of one of the younger Monks. The Cabinet of Father <HI>Augereau,</HI> in the little Garden adjoyning, de&s;erves to be &s;een; there are &s;ome good Pictures, and curious Prints. This Father is very skilfull in the&s;e matters, but he hath not the opportuni|ty of making any great Collection. The&s;e Monks are very regular, and never eat any fle&s;h, unle&s;s they be &s;ick, or happen to be above two leagues from home. They ob&s;erve much the &s;ame Rule with the <HI>Ci&s;tercians,</HI> being a branch of that Or|der.</P>
<P>Near this, on the edg of the River is the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Fieubet</HI> belonging to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Fieubet,</HI> Coun|&s;ellor of State in Ordinary, and Chancellor to the decea&s;ed Queen. He cau&s;ed it to be built about three or four years ago. One can hardly de&s;ire a neater hou&s;e than this both within and without. The Stair-ca&s;e is very light and adorn|ed with Bu&s;ts between the Windows. The apart|ments are contrived in <HI>enfilade</HI> as the mode is at pre&s;ent; on one &s;ide they look into the Garden, and on the other &s;ide upon the River. The Furniture is of the &s;ame neatne&s;s, as well in the Rooms above Stairs as below. The great piece of Per&s;pective on the adjoyning wall is very fine; it is painted in <HI>Fre&s;co</HI> with a great deal of fancy. It repre&s;ents a Building compo&s;ed of two great Arches, between which are &s;ome Pillars and a Statue of an Hero between them. Over all there is a Sun-dial, about which are placed &s;everal Fi|gures, among others a Woman pulling Feathers out of a Cocks tail to point out the hours upon a Tablet, and Time over her head &s;eems to approve the Action. All the Work keeps its Colours ve|ry well, which is not u&s;ual in Paintings expo&s;ed to the injuries of the Air, which la&s;t but a &s;hort

<P>The <HI>Church of St. Paul</HI> which is the Pari&s;h Church of this Quarter, is in the Street that runs along near the la&s;t mentioned H&ocirc;tel. Formerly this Church was the Pari&s;h Church of the Kings hou&s;e while the Court remained at the <HI>Palais des Tournelles.</HI> It was built, as is to be &s;een, in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI.</P>
<P>As you go towards the I&s;le of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame</HI> you come again <HI>to the Convent of the Nuns of the Ave-Maria</HI> in the <HI>R&uuml;e des Barrieres.</HI> They are of St. <HI>Clares</HI> Order. St. <HI>Lewis</HI> had former|ly placed in this hou&s;e certain <HI>Beguines,</HI> which were Nuns of the Order of St. <HI>Begue,</HI> a <HI>Fleming</HI> by extraction. They wore a Coif that hid almo&s;t all their Face, But in the Reign of <HI>Lewis</HI> XI. Queen <HI>Charlotte</HI> introduced the third Order of St. <HI>Francis,</HI> with the Reform, and her Son King <HI>Charles</HI> VIII. built for the Friers, the hou&s;e ad|joyning, &s;eparated only by the pa&s;&s;age that leads to the Church. There is not in all <HI>Paris</HI> any Con|vent of Nuns who live more au&s;tere than the&s;e. They never eat any Fle&s;h, nor wear any Linnen, and be&s;ides that, they ri&s;e at midnight, and go continually barefoot without Sandals or Stockings, with a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of a perpetual Silence. Nor can we find in any Convent a greater Stock of Vir|tue, and more di&s;e&s;teem and neglect of &s;ecular
<PB N="143" REF="77">
affairs. The&s;e good Nuns never think of the World but when they pray to God to forgive the di&s;orders which are committed in it. And as they have no other Sub&s;i&s;tence than by Alms, &s;o have they no other tru&s;t than to the Divine Providence, which is never wanting; <HI>Paris</HI> containing &s;o great a number of Pious People, by who&s;e Charity they are maintained. Seldom or never are any permitted to &s;peak with them; &s;o that in the mid&s;t of <HI>Paris</HI> they are as much retired from the World as<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">if in the darke&s;t &s;olitude. On this ac|count you very rarely &s;ee my Coaches at their Gate. At &s;uch times as they are obliged to &s;peak to their neare&s;t Relations, it mu&s;t be in the Church, they having not throughout their whole hou&s;e any other <HI>Parloir</HI> or &s;peaking Room. The Tomb of the illu&s;trious Ance&s;tors of Mon&s;ieur the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> who have been con|cerned with honour in the greate&s;t Employments, &s;tands in a Chappel belonging to this Church.</P>
<P>A little further is <HI>the H&ocirc;tel de Sens</HI> with an old Gothick Gate but hand&s;om enough. For|merly the Arch-Bi&s;hops of that City, who were Metropolitans of <HI>Paris,</HI> re&s;ided here. But under the Pontificate of <HI>&V;rban</HI> VIII. <HI>Paris</HI> having been di&s;membred from that Arch Bi&s;hoprick this Hotel hath been &s;ince let out to &s;everal parti|cular per&s;ons who pay their Rents to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sens.</HI></P>
<P>After this you pa&s;s over the Bridge called <HI>Pont-Marie,</HI> to go into the I&s;le <HI>de No&s;tre-Dame.</HI> Ob|&s;erve as you go that this Bridge is not &s;o full of Hou&s;es as it might be, in regard that in <HI>March</HI> 1657. the River being extraordinarily overflown, it carried away two Arches n the night time, to a very great lo&s;s both of Per&s;ons and Goods,

<HEAD>The I&s;le of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The I&s;le of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame</HI> takes its name from the Church of <HI>Paris</HI> to which it belongs as part of their E&s;tate. All the hou&s;es which we &s;ee there at pre&s;ent are the work of this Age. It was formerly a Meadow ground where people of all &s;orts u&s;ed to walk to take the Air, in the middle of which place &s;tood a &s;mall Chappel Dedicated to St. <HI>Lewis.</HI> At pre&s;ent it is all compa&s;&s;ed about with a Key of Free-&s;tone very firm, and filled with very hand&s;om hou&s;es, among which there are &s;ome mo&s;t magnifick, and which may be compared with the mo&s;t beautiful Palaces; e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e which are &s;ituated at the corner on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, where the <HI>Seine</HI> divides it &s;elf into two Arms to make the I&s;le. The Streets are &s;trait, and all end upon the edge of the River.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hou&s;e which ought to be ob&s;erved on the &s;ide of <HI>Pont-Marie,</HI> is that of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Grand-Mai&s;on,</HI> which appears to be &s;olidly built, and who&s;e in&s;ide is extreme hand&s;om. As you pa&s;s further, you come to the hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Lambert de Terigny</HI> Pre&s;ident of the Chamber of Accounts, who&s;e chief Entrance is from the <HI>R&uuml;e St. Louis</HI> which cro&s;&s;es the I&s;le from one end to the other. This Hou&s;e is magnifick in all its parts, the Gate is great and high, and the Lock|&s;miths Work is very extraordinary. But this is not that which is mo&s;t ob&s;ervable. The four
<PB N="145" REF="78">
&s;ides of the Court are adorned each with a Front of admirable Buildings &s;et off with great Io|nick Pila&s;ters, which reach from the Ground to the top of the Fabrick, with Va&s;es upon the tops. The Stairca&s;e is placed at the bottom of the Court, with two Ranks of Pillars, directly over which the light falls full upon the Steps, without the lea&s;t ob&s;tacle. The fir&s;t Apartment is compo&s;ed of &s;everal Chambers one beyond another, from all which you have a delicate pro&s;pect upon the River on the Garden &s;ide in &s;uch &s;ort that in a clear day one may &s;ee &s;ix or &s;even Leagues into the Country, which is a very con&s;iderable plea|&s;ure. In the&s;e Apartments you may &s;ee &s;ome Cieling-pieces of the be&s;t &s;ort of Painting, e&s;pe|cially in the la&s;t Chamber, which is all of <HI>le Sueur</HI>'s work, who in an age but very little ad|vanced gave great hopes in time to equal the be&s;t Painters of <HI>Italy,</HI> as one may perceive by the la&s;t Pictures which he made. Tho&s;e things of his which are to be &s;een in this hou&s;e are the be&s;t that ever he did, chiefly the Paintings in the <HI>Alcove</HI> repre&s;enting the Mu&s;es in a Con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick, the Cieling-piece is almo&s;t of equal Beauty. The Moveables of this Apartment are extreme rich. From thence you ought to go into the Gallery which is on the &s;ame Floor. All that is devi&s;ed ordinarily to adorn the faire&s;t Galleries may be found in this, gilding upon Sculpture curiou&s;ly wrought, with a Ceiling enriched with Pictures of the be&s;t Ma&s;ters, among which are &s;everal of <HI>le Sueur,</HI> of whom I &s;poke before, which one may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h from the re&s;t, although tho&s;e which are not of his hand are not however to be neglected, being very well paint|ed.
<PB N="146" REF="79">
The door, by which you enter into this Gal|lery, is &s;u&s;tained on the in&s;ide with two Corin|thian Pillars all over gilt, the &s;ides are almo&s;t of the &s;ame fa&s;hion, with Pa&iuml;&s;ages and Pila&s;ters of the &s;ame Order, between which are placed Bu&s;ts of Marble upon Tables of the &s;ame; the end of the Room does determine in a little Terra&s;e in manner of a Balcony, which commands all over the River. The Apartments below are not &s;o well adorned, tho they al&s;o have their Beauties. In the Garden are to be &s;een &s;ome Statues hand&s;om enough. And you ought not to forget to &s;ee the Orangerie, which in Winter is in a Hall, where one may walk about very conveniently. Near to which place there is another, &s;eparated only by a great partition that is gla&s;ed, through which one has the plea&s;ure in the mid&s;t of Winter to &s;ee the Vertue of the Orange-trees. The face of the hou&s;e on the Garden &s;ide is of the &s;ame Symmetry and Order of Building with that in the Court, which thing gives this hou&s;e an air of grandeur at a great di&s;tance, and which &s;hews extremely fine as one comes to <HI>Paris</HI> by Water from <HI>Charenton.</HI> Near this is</P>
<P>The hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Bretonvilliers,</HI> another Pre&s;ident in the Chamber of Ac|counts. This hou&s;e is yet better &s;ituated than that of which I have been &s;peaking, in regard it &s;tands upon the very point of the I&s;le, and the River is on both &s;ides of it. It is al&s;o much more great and &s;pacious. The Ma&s;onry tho it be of no &s;et Order of Architecture becau&s;e of the many Ornaments that are there placed, is notwith&s;tand|ing extreme hand&s;om to the eye. The Stair-ca&s;e is on the left hand in one of the Corners of the

Court: built with much &s;olidity as is all the re&s;t of the hou&s;e; there has been no &s;paring of Vaults in tho&s;e places where there appeared any occa&s;ion. This hou&s;e is truely great and contains in it all things nece&s;&s;ary for the entertainment of a great Lord. The outward Court is parted from the re&s;t in &s;uch manner as it cannot cau&s;e the lea&s;t inconvenience. As to the beauty and delights of the in&s;ide they are more con&s;iderable than that of which I treated la&s;t, in regard its Pro&s;pect is farther extended, and that it &s;eems from the Windows of this Hou&s;e that all the Boats that come continually to <HI>Paris,</HI> are coming to land at its door, and here it is that they &s;eparate on the one &s;ide or the other, to go either to the <HI>Port St. Paul</HI> or to the <HI>Port de la Tournelle,</HI> where u&s;ually they unload their Burthens. The mova|bles are magni&s;ick; con&s;i&s;ting of Beds mo&s;t rich|ly embroidered, Chenets, Tables, Sconces, Look|ing-gla&s;&s;es, and Ornaments for the Chimneys of Gold&s;miths work, of Tapi&s;try heighthened with Gold and Silver; all things are there in abundance. The Pictures are al&s;o of the be&s;t &s;ort, &s;ince they are of Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Bruns</HI> hand, who is at pre&s;ent the chief Painter of the Kingdom. The Gallery which is on the left hand is all of his Work, the &s;ides of which, in&s;tead of Wain&s;cot are coverd with Paintings in fre&s;quo, &s;uch as employ the Curious a long time in beholding them, who take a mighty plea&s;ure to di&s;cover in the&s;e pieces that which they u&s;ually &s;eek for in <HI>Italy</HI> with &s;o much concern and pains. The Apartments below Stairs are very plea&s;ant. There are Baths, and a Hall extreme convenient for Summer, by rea&s;on of that fre&s;h air which is there gathered. In fine,

nothing is wanting in this hou&s;e, and one may find there all the conveniences that can be de&s;ired of what &s;ort &s;oever; he who cau&s;ed it to be built having not &s;pared the greate&s;t of expen&s;es to ren|der it &s;uch as it is.</P>
<P>Leaving this hou&s;e we ought to pa&s;s along the Key called <HI>Quay Dauphin,</HI> otherwi&s;e, the Key of Balcones, almo&s;t all the Hou&s;es that are built here having Balcones before the Window, among the re&s;t one ought to be ob&s;erved more e&s;pecially, which is that in which at pre&s;ent dwells Mon&s;ieur the Abbot of St. <HI>Croix,</HI> Ma&s;ter of Reque&s;ts, it was built with much care, by the decea&s;ed Mon&s;ieur <HI>He&s;&s;elin,</HI> who was one of the mo&s;t curious per|&s;ons of his time, and it was de&s;igned by the Sieur <HI>le Veau.</HI> The Front is of a very hand&s;om de&s;ign, without crowding in of in&s;ignificant Ornaments. And on the in&s;ide there are very beautiful Ciel|ings, with Chimney-pieces of the be&s;t &s;ort of Workman&s;hip. The Court is in truth a little too ob&s;cure, but this defect is advantagiou&s;ly repaired by the Symmetry of the Building on that &s;ide, and by the curious pro&s;pect from thence.</P>
<P>Near this is the hou&s;e of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Roulier,</HI> the Stair-ca&s;e of which is extreme hand&s;om, it is &s;up|ported with Ionick Pillars and adorned with Ba&s;-relie&s;e.

<P>The Church of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> tho it be not yet fini&s;hed. That which is begun is of a very fine &s;ort of Architecture. The Porta is &s;upported with Dorick Pillars. And when this Church is com|pleated it will de&s;erve to be compared to the be&s;t

This Abby is very ancient, of &s;uch An|tiquity that we are not well a&s;&s;ured of the time of its fir&s;t Foundation. We know only that King <HI>Lewis</HI> the Gro&s;s in the year 1113. cau&s;ed a great Church to be built in this place, where was be|fore but a very little Chappel: and we read in the Church-Hi&s;tory of <HI>Paris,</HI> that <HI>Thomas de Cham|peaux</HI> Canon of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame,</HI> and a famous Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Theology, having a difference with one of his Di&s;ciples named <HI>Abaillard,</HI> retired with &s;ome of his Scholars to a place near the little Chappel of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> and that he took the habit of a Chanon Regular, which po&s;&s;ibly might be the Original of this Abby, which from that time did always encrea&s;e more and more. This happened about the year 1105. The Quarrel between this <HI>Thomas de Champeaux</HI> and the &s;aid <HI>Abaillard</HI> is much &s;poken of in the Hi&s;tories of that time, and there are many very remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in it which notwith&s;tanding are not proper to be re|ported in this Work.</P>

It is the only Library of all <HI>Paris</HI> that is open in this manner, but we hope in time there will be others in that City that will yield the like profit. In the other parts of this hou&s;e we find nothing very curious. There is in the Church here great Devotion to our Lady of Succour, and to St. <HI>Clair,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Autun,</HI> who is invoked for &s;ore Eyes. Among the Monks of St. <HI>Victor</HI> there are many Learned Per&s;ons, &s;ome of which are Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Sante&uuml;il,</HI> almo&s;t the only man in <HI>France</HI> who under&s;tands to make In&s;criptions in Ver&s;e for publick Monu|ments, he is of an extraordinary ability in this Science and all things of this nature which we &s;ee come from him, are intirely fine. <HI>Hugh</HI> of St. <HI>Victor</HI> a famous Divine was al&s;o of this hou&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>The Kings Garden.</HEAD>
<P>This Garden is filled with nothing but Medici|nal Plants of mo&s;t choice &s;orts, which are there nouri&s;hed and looked after at the Kings Charges. Certain Months in the Year, here are <HI>Botanick</HI> Le|ctures, to the hearing of which any one may be admitted freely. There is a Doctor of Pyh&s;ick who hath a Sallary for this purpo&s;e, and who is ordinarily more eminent than the re&s;t for his Learning. This Lecture is made at &s;ix of the Clock in the morning, in tho&s;e parts of the Gar|den where the &s;everal Simples grow. One ought to ob&s;erve that half this Garden is taken up by a Mount or eminent Ground, round which they have made an Ally which mounts about it in a Spiral Line, which Ally has on the outward edge a Pali&s;ade of Bu&s;hes, on the top of this Mount is an Accacias from whence you have a Pro&s;pect over the River and <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> St. <HI>Antoine.</HI> On the left hand as you come into the Court, is a La|boratory, where they al&s;o work publickly in Chy|mi&s;try during certain months in the year. The Compo&s;itions which they make there are given freely to &s;uch poor that need 'em.</P>
<P>But that which is the greate&s;t Curio&s;ity of all is the Cabinet of Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Vernay</HI> one of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and one of the prime Men of the Kingdom for Di&s;&s;ections and Anato|my. Few People ever made a farther progre&s;s than he in this &s;ort of operation, in which he hath made a great number of Di&s;coveries, that

The Superintendant of the Buildings is the ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter here, and it is under his Autho|rity that all the&s;e things are tran&s;acted. Leaving this place you may go to</P>
<P>The Ho&s;pital-general; altho for delicate peo|ple it is no very plea&s;ing object to &s;ee the poor, yet it is a curious thing, and &s;urpri&s;ing at the &s;ame time, to &s;ee &s;o great a number of all &s;orts and ages, who&s;e mi&s;eries are ea&s;ed with &s;o much care and Charity, that nothing is wanting to them but only Liberty. This great Building which contains in it more than &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons, ap|pears as you come in like a little Town, by rea|&s;on of the quantity and diver&s;ity of the hou&s;es, although it be all the Work of this age, and all the poor People that are in it are maintained upon Charity only. The Church was built not above &s;even or eight years ago: It is of a very peculiar de&s;ign; a great Dome of eight Angles rai&s;ed up|on Arches, again&s;t each of which are placed eight Naves or &s;paces to contain all the poor people. The Altar is contrived ju&s;t in the middle under the Dome, &s;o that it may be &s;een on eight &s;ides for the conveniency of all. There is nothing mag|nificent in the Work, except only the Portico by which people enter from abroad, which is &s;up|ported
<PB N="155" REF="83">
by certain Ionick Pillars, over which is placed a &s;mall Attick, but this is of no extraor|dinary reli&s;h however. On the two &s;ides of this Entrance are placed two Pavilions where are lodg|ed the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks who &s;erve the Chappel, and admini&s;ter the Sacraments to the poor People. It is ob&s;ervable that they imploy here all the young girls of the Ho&s;pital, who are very numerous, in making point of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ome embroider, others make the Loops, others the Ground, which cau&s;es much work to be di&s;patched by their hands in a little time, of which is made a con&s;iderable in|come. The fir&s;t Pre&s;ident <HI>de Belli&eacute;vre</HI> was one of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t active in the Foundation of this great Ho&s;pital, which at that time was thought incredible; and this was done on the ac|count of that exce&s;&s;ive number of Poor which were continually about the Streets and Churches of <HI>Paris,</HI> to the great incommodity of the Pub|lick.

<P>This Hou&s;e is almo&s;t behind the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> of Saint <HI>Marcel.</HI> Here it is that the Curious ought to apply them&s;elves with their utmo&s;t diligence to ob&s;erve all the Rarities that are to be &s;een in this place, in regard there is no part of <HI>Europe</HI> that produces &s;o many. But to give you a ju&s;ter Idea, I &s;hall make a De&s;cription.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, it is not unu&s;eful to ob&s;erve that this place has been always inhabited by excellent Arti&s;ts: and that heretofore it was imploy|ed by the famous Dyers of Wood, the fir&s;t of which was one <HI>Giles Goblin,</HI> who, as report &s;ays, found out the &s;ecret of dying the be&s;t Scarlet, or at lea&s;t that he fir&s;t brought it to <HI>Paris,</HI> from whence it comes that ever &s;ince it hath been cal|led Scarlet <HI>des Gobelines.</HI> This Hou&s;e hath &s;till kept the old name as well as the little River that runs behind it, which Water hath a peculiar Ver|tue for the dying of this Colour, and before that time it was called the River of <HI>Bieure.</HI> The Dutch have made it their utmo&s;t endeavour to di&s;cover this &s;ecret, but they could never do it with all their indu&s;try and expence, however they come pretty near, but they cannot arrive to that Degree of perfection, which our Dyers have in making this Beautiful colour, which makes &s;o great a Merchan|dize through all <HI>Europe,</HI> nay in a manner through the whole World, for much goes into the <HI>Indies</HI> and <HI>America.</HI> But not to &s;ay more of this hou&s;e and River called the <HI>Gobelins,</HI> let us now
<PB N="157" REF="84">
&s;peak of the things that are there to be &s;een. It is to be ob&s;erved that all the Arti&s;ts that work here are employed only for the King, and that their Works which they perform here are for the Decoration and Ornament of the Royal Palaces. Some years &s;ince the number of the Workmen was much greater than at pre&s;ent; but the pro|digious quantity of Work which they did is the oc|ca&s;ion that they are now much retrenched, in re|gard the Repo&s;itories where the Kings moveables are kept are &s;ufficiently filled, in &s;uch &s;ort that one may &s;ay at this time there is no Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> that hath more Gold&s;miths work or Tapi&s;try.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that is to be viewed are the Pi|ctures, which are, in a manner, all of the hand of famous Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Brun,</HI> the able&s;t Painter of <HI>France,</HI> and who&s;e Works are &s;o much &s;ought after and admired by all tho&s;e who are skilled in Painting. As a reward for who&s;e great pains which he is continually engaged in, and for the Emulation of tho&s;e who have any Genius in de|&s;igning, the King hath been plea&s;ed not only to give him large Pen&s;ions, to declare him Over&s;eer of all the Works in Painting and Sculpture which are done for him, and to name him Director of the Academy-Royal of Painting, but he hath al|&s;o ennobled him by his Letters Patents. The Principal Pieces of this excellent Ma&s;ter are at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> The great Stair-ca&s;e is almo&s;t all of his hand, and he is working at pre&s;ent in the great Gallery, which takes up all that &s;ide that looks upon the Garden. In the Louvre there are al&s;o divers Cieling-pieces of his de&s;ign. In the Church of <HI>N&ocirc;tre-dame</HI> are two Pieces, one re|pre&s;ents the Martyrdom of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> the other
<PB N="158" REF="85">
the Cruci&s;ying of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> both which Pieces are in the Quire on each &s;ide of the high Altar, and which one may ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h from other Pictures, at the <HI>Carmelites</HI> in the <HI>Faux-bourg</HI> St. <HI>Jacques.</HI> The &s;econd great Piece which re|pre&s;ents a <HI>Magdelain</HI> at the feet of our Saviour in the Hou&s;e of <HI>Simon</HI> the <HI>Leper,</HI> is of his hand, &s;o al&s;o another Piece of the &s;ame Saint, in one of the Chappels of the &s;ame Church, which was much admired by the Queen Mother, who began fir&s;t from the &s;ight of this Piece to have an e&s;teem for M. <HI>le Brun,</HI> whom &s;oon after &s;he made known at Court by the means of the Chancel|lor <HI>Seguier,</HI> by whom he was mightily e&s;teemed. Mo&s;t of the Works which are wrought in the <HI>Gobelins</HI> are of his de&s;ign, and it is he that or|ders the Performance. His Cabinet is one of the mo&s;t curious that can be &s;een; in which he has collected the Paintings of the mo&s;t excellent Ma&s;ters that have been, and &s;everal other rare Pie|ces which have a Relation to Painting. I will &s;ay one thing more to the Glory of M. <HI>le Brun</HI> that he hath under him &s;everal other Painters who do nothing el&s;e but Copy his Draughts and work after his De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The &s;econd thing which one ought to &s;ee in this Place, is the Tapi&s;try Works. Among that great number of Arti&s;ts that work here in this Manufacture, there are &s;ome <HI>Flemings,</HI> who are equal to the mo&s;t Renowned of the la&s;t age at <HI>Anvers.</HI> Nothing can be &s;een finer than what comes from their hands, be it in Hi&s;tory or Land|skip, in both which Gold and Silver are imploy|ed even to profu&s;ion, and they have &s;ome pieces there that are all over heighthned after that man|ner.
<PB N="159" REF="85">
When we have well examind the&s;e things we mu&s;t conclude that there is no part of the World where they make better Work, or better under&s;tand the perfect way of Shadowing the Wool. It is however Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Brun,</HI> who gives them the De&s;igns, and for the mo&s;t part they Copy his Paintings. Of late they have al&s;o copied &s;ome of the be&s;t things of <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> (the greate&s;t man of our age without contradiction) among others, the little <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> which they had from the Cabinet of the lately decea&s;ed Madam <HI>Le&s;cot:</HI> The Rock in the Wilderne&s;s with the Fountain of Waters flowing from it, which be|longed to the decea&s;ed Mon&s;ieur <HI>Dreux</HI> Coun|&s;ellor of the great Council, and two other Pictures from the Cabinet of Mon&s;ieur the <HI>Chevalier de Lorraine,</HI> one of which repre&s;ents the pa&s;&s;age through the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and the other the Wor&s;hip of the Golden Calf. They have made al&s;o many Pieces from <HI>Raphael</HI> and <HI>Michael Angelo.</HI> But one of their mo&s;t beautiful and curious things is the Hi&s;tory of the King repre&s;ented in divers Pieces, of which &s;ubject may be made divers Suits of Hangings, in which are contained the principal Actions of his Life, as the Battels he hath gained, the Towns he hath taken, the Ceremonies of his Marriage, the renovation of the Alliance with the Deputies of the thirteen Cantons of <HI>Swi&s;&s;es,</HI> and many other Pa&s;&s;ages of &s;uch like nature, the Borders of the&s;e Pieces have the Ground-work of Gold, with Grote&s;ques, and &s;everal Devices and Cyphers at the Corners and in the middle which things are of coloured Silk, and &s;hew delicately upon the Gold ground. The Sieur <HI>Gens</HI> and <HI>le Fevre</HI> have the over&s;ight and direction of
<PB N="160" REF="86">
tho&s;e who work at that &s;ort of Tapi&s;try which is called the high Li&s;ts, and the Sieurs <HI>Mozin</HI> and <HI>de la Croix,</HI> tho&s;e who work at the low Li&s;ts.</P>
<P>After you have &s;een the Tapi&s;tries you ought to &s;ee the place where they carve and engrave up|on Copper and Bra&s;s for Clo&s;ets and &s;uch like matters. It is here that they made tho&s;e curious Locks that are to be &s;een at <HI>Ver&s;ailles,</HI> and the <HI>Louvre,</HI> which are wrought with &s;uch delicate Workman&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t Court through which you pa&s;s to &s;ee the things of which we have been &s;peaking, you ought not to forget to vi&s;it the hou&s;es of <HI>le Sieur Loir</HI> and <HI>le Sieur Villiers,</HI> two famous Gold&s;miths, who are imployed continually for the King: You will find often under their hands Works of mighty value. Here it was where they made tho&s;e two Balu&s;ters for the Alcove, which are at <HI>Ver&s;ailles</HI> before the Kings Bed, and the Queens. One may know of what Beauty, Workman&s;hip, and Riches they are, &s;ince the price of each amounted to two hundred thou&s;and Crowns. They are all of &s;olid Silver without any thing to help out, either within the Pede|&s;tals or Rails, other than the thickne&s;s of the metal it &s;elf, which has been employed with Pro|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Near the Gold&s;miths, in the &s;ame Court on the right hand, you may find certain Works of an extraordinary nature performed by the <HI>Sieur Branquier,</HI> and the <HI>Sieur Ferdinand de Meliori,</HI> who were both invited out of <HI>Italy</HI> to make here a kind of <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Work; which will co&s;t much time and expence. They are a &s;ort of Pictures, the different colours of which are made of inlaid
<PB N="161" REF="86">
Stones, which repre&s;ent Figures extreme like, and very well de&s;igned. The&s;e Pieces are mo&s;t commonly compo&s;ed of <HI>Agate, Lapis Lazuli, Jacinth,</HI> and <HI>Cornelian,</HI> which makes a colour|ing more lively and brillant than ordinary Paint|ing, which Stones are joyned together with a &s;ort of <HI>Ma&s;tick</HI> very hard. They are ordinarily placed upon Ebony Cabinets, or Tables of great price. At the habitation of one of the&s;e Arti&s;ts there is a little Garden behind his hou&s;e, which is very pretty and in which are divers Ornaments of artificial Rocks and Shell-work.</P>
<P>After you have examined the&s;e things, you re|turn by the &s;ame way to vi&s;it other Curio&s;ities that are to be &s;een in another Court. There are two Workhou&s;es for Carvers and Statuaries, the one of which is governed by the <HI>Sieur Bapti&s;te,</HI> in which is the Statue of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Turenne</HI> in white Marble, which is to be placed at St. <HI>De|nis</HI> upon the Tomb which the King hath there cau&s;ed to be rai&s;ed for him; here is al&s;o a great Mu&s;e, bigger than the life, of excellent Work|man&s;hip, which is intended to be placed at <HI>Ver|&s;ailles</HI> with divers other Statues of the &s;ame big|ne&s;s. The other Workhou&s;e is governed by the <HI>Sieur Coe&s;vau,</HI> who for the mo&s;t part works af|ter the life. He hath made &s;everal Bu&s;ts and other Figures of repre&s;entation. This is he that made the Kings Bu&s;t which &s;tands in the great Stair-ca&s;e at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI></P>
<P>After this you ought to &s;ee the Embroiderers, who are in a Hall near which you pa&s;s to go to the great Court. They are employed upon di|vers Pieces, in which the richne&s;s of the materi|als does mo&s;t commonly vie with the beauty of the Work.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="87">
Near this place here are &s;till two Statuaries more in two Low Rooms, where you may &s;ee &s;ome Pieces in Marble and &s;ome in Lead for the Fountains at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> Be&s;ides tho&s;e things al|ready de&s;cribed, there are many other Curio&s;ities in this great Hou&s;e, which the Curious may ob|&s;erve, and which would be too long to treat of in particular. We have already &s;aid that here are all &s;orts of excellent Arti&s;ts who have been invi|ted hither from different Parts. Among whom we ought not to forget M. <HI>Audrean,</HI> one of the able&s;t Gravers of his time: he hath etcht and gra|ved all the great Pieces of M. <HI>le Brun,</HI> as the Triumph of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, the Battel of <HI>Maxentius,</HI> all the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Alexander,</HI> in five great Pieces, and divers other things of that great Painter. All that comes from his hand, is of a &s;ingular beauty, and mo&s;t exact de&s;ign, the mo&s;t correct that can be: which occa&s;ions that all his Work &s;ells much dearer than others, nay often|times it is difficult to get them at any rate in re|gard all the be&s;t Proofs are re&s;erved for the Kings Cabinet. He hath al&s;o graved &s;everal Pieces from the famous <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> which all Curious Per&s;ons trea&s;ure up in their Clo&s;ets. The Sieur <HI>le Clere</HI> dwells here al&s;o who is very able and well e&s;teem|ed in this Art. And the&s;e are the mo&s;t curious things at the Hou&s;e called <HI>les Gobelins.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we return again into the Town by the <HI>Fauxbourg</HI> St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> and we pa&s;s before the Church of that name, which was fir&s;t found|ed by <HI>Roland</HI> Earl of <HI>Blare</HI> Nephew of <HI>Charle|magne,</HI> who was a great Benefactor to it, in con|ferring great Priviledges upon the Canons who &s;erved there. This Church did heretofore bear
<PB N="163" REF="87">
the title of S. <HI>Clement.</HI> But the Body of S. <HI>Marcel</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> being found here it took his name, which it hath kept ever &s;ince. The famous <HI>Peter Lombard,</HI> &s;urnamed the Ma&s;ter of the Sentences, is here interred. And this is his Epitaph,</P>
<Q LANG="lat">Hic jacet Magi&s;ter <HI>Petrus Lombardus, Pari&s;i|en&s;is</HI> Epi&s;copus, qui compo&s;uit Librum Sen|tentiarum, Glo&s;&s;as P&s;almorum, &amp; Epi&s;to|larum: cujus obitus lies e&s;t <HI>13.</HI> Cal. <HI>Au|gu&s;ti</HI> Anno <HI>1164.</HI></Q>

<P>There are al&s;o in this <HI>Fauxbourg,</HI> the <HI>Cordelier</HI> Nuns. Who&s;e Convent was fir&s;t built at <HI>Troyes</HI> by <HI>Thibaut</HI> VII. Earl of <HI>Champagne</HI> and of <HI>Brie,</HI> but they were removed to <HI>Paris</HI> &s;oon af|ter, becau&s;e of the inconveniency of the place where they were fir&s;t founded. <HI>Margaret de Provence</HI> Wife to St. <HI>Lewis</HI> cau&s;ed the Church to be begun as we now &s;ee it, and <HI>Blanch</HI> her Daughter Widow of the King of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> be|came a Nun there, and gave a con&s;iderable Aug|mentation to the E&s;tate of this Hou&s;e, She built the Cloi&s;ter where are yet remaining her Arms in &s;everal places.

Friers of the great Convent in <HI>Paris;</HI> there is nothing of &s;ingular note in their Church, no more than in that of</P>
<P>St. <HI>Medard,</HI> the Pari&s;h-Church of this Quar|ter; where there hapned in the la&s;t Age a furi|ous Tumult, rai&s;ed by the <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> who came flocking with Arms in hand to Ma&s;&s;acre the Ca|tholicks being then at <HI>Ve&s;pers;</HI> the cau&s;e pre|tended was that the noi&s;e of the Bells of this Church did di&s;turb them in hearing their Ser|mon which at that time was in a hou&s;e clo&s;e by. But they were puni&s;hed for their Ra&s;hne&s;s; for the Citizens taking Arms, killed all tho&s;e that fell in their power. This was the fir&s;t occa&s;ion of that hatred which the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> bear to tho&s;e of the pretended Reformed Religion; and the Hi&s;torians ob&s;erve that from that time the <HI>Calvi|ni&s;ts</HI> threw off their Mask and went arm'd in the Streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> but the Catholicks not being able to endure this, it was the occa&s;ion of many Di&s;orders which hapned afterwards.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Patru</HI> from whom we have a Vo|lume of Pleadings extremely fine, is interred in this Church. Mon&s;ieur <HI>d'Ablencour</HI> had &s;o great an e&s;teem for his Judgment that on his death-bed he recommended his Works to his Correction.</P>
<P>In this Quarter near the little Church of S. <HI>Hippolytus,</HI> is an ancient hou&s;e built in the time of St. <HI>Lewis</HI> which is not far from the River <HI>des Gobelins,</HI> where that good King would &s;ome|times u&s;e to pa&s;s his hours of Solitude, in Prayer. It is &s;aid that under <HI>Charles</HI> VI. there happened here a very unhappy accident, which was partly the cau&s;e of the di&s;traction with which that Prince was afflicted the greate&s;t part of his Reign.
<PB N="165" REF="88">
The Story is thus reported. The <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> who always made it their glory pa&s;&s;ionately to love their King, being de&s;irous to enter|tain <HI>Charles</HI> VI. with a Ball in this hou&s;e, upon his return from a great Victory which he had gained over the Revolted <HI>Flemings;</HI> The King was at this Entertainment with ma|ny Lords di&s;gui&s;ed like Salvages, and apparelled in Linnen pitcht over and covered with Flax, like hair, and &s;o clo&s;e fitted to the Body that it &s;eemed to be the natural skin; as he was dan|cing with the young Lords one of the Company approaching too near, a Flambeau held by a Prince who was de&s;irous to di&s;cover the King from the re&s;t, it hapned that the Flame caught the Flax and burnt furiou&s;ly; and they being all fa&s;tened to one another, the King could find no &s;ecurity but by ca&s;ting him&s;elf all covered with Flames as he was, into the Arms of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Ber|ry,</HI> who very happily being then pre&s;ent extin|gui&s;hed the Flame by covering him all over with her great Gown. The other Ma&s;quers were all either &s;tifled or roa&s;ted alive and died within two days after, the King and <HI>Manto&uuml;illet</HI> only e&s;caping, which la&s;t ca&s;t him&s;elf headlong into a Tub of Water, which he hapned to light of not far from the place. After this &s;ad accident <HI>Charles</HI> began to fall extreme Moro&s;e and Me|lancholy, and the Idea of &s;o great a peril prepared his brain for that madne&s;s which &s;eized upon him near the Town of <HI>Mans,</HI> in &s;uch manner as is recorded by Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mezeray.</HI> And this is all that is to be &s;een in this <HI>Fauxbourg.</HI></P>
<P>The Gates by which you go into the Town are two, that of St. <HI>Victor</HI> near the Abby of that
<PB N="166" REF="89">
name, of which Abby we have already &s;poken. This Gate was lately repaired but not with &s;o great expence as the others. There is only re|pre&s;ented in Ba&s;&s;e&punc;taille over the Arch, a great Ship of War, which are the Town Arms, with this In&s;cription beneath it,</P>
<Q LANG="lat">QUAE NON MARIA?</Q>
<Q>What Seas does &s;he not Sail through?</Q>
<P>The other Gate is that of St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> behind St. <HI>Genevi&eacute;ue du Mont.</HI></P>
<P>Near this on the <HI>Fo&s;&s;e</HI> between the two Gates lives Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Troyes,</HI> who&s;e Pictures you ought not to &s;ail of &s;eeing. He was &s;ent by the King into <HI>Bavaria</HI> to take the Picture of Ma|dame the Dauphine&s;s. Few Painters have been more &s;ucce&s;sful than he after the Life. This hath attained him the Practice of mo&s;t Per&s;ons of Quality, who cau&s;e them&s;elves to be drawn by his hand.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the Convent of Engli&s;h Nuns, nor of the Hou&s;e of the Fathers of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, which are al&s;o upon the &s;ame Fo&s;&s;e, there being nothing curious about them to remark, unle&s;s it be one of the be&s;t Pro&s;pects that we can &s;ee, by rea&s;on of the high &s;ituation of the Place where the&s;e two hou&s;es &s;tand.</P>

<HEAD>The &V;niver&s;ity Quarter.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Quarter is one of the antiente&s;t and be&s;t Peopled of all <HI>Paris.</HI> It takes up a very great &s;pace of Ground, al|mo&s;t the fourth part of the Town. <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus,</HI> at &s;uch time as he went to <HI>Pa|le&s;tine,</HI> with <HI>Richard</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> again&s;t

the <HI>Sarrazins,</HI> gave order that during his Jour|ney (which la&s;ted a whole Year) this Quar|ter &s;hould be inclo&s;ed with Walls; &s;ome Remains of which one may perceive at this Day.</P>
<P>The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Paris</HI> is &s;o antient, that, as &s;ome hold, <HI>Charlemagne</HI> was its Founder. This o|pinion is built upon certain old Titles, which are pre&s;erved with great care. Notwith&s;tanding there are many Learned Men, who are of a con|trary opinion; among others Mon&s;ieur <HI>Joli,</HI> Grand Chanter of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame,</HI> who has clearly proved his Sentiments, in his <HI>Little Tract of the Epi&s;copal Schools.</HI> But if it be doubtful, whether it were founded by that Great Emperor; it is however mo&s;t certain, that it began to appear in a very little time after his Reign, which was in <HI>France</HI> a Glorious one, for Learning and Learn|ed Men, to whom this great Prince &s;hewed all the Favour that could be. And in Gratitude, they have rendered him famous to Po&s;terity, not only as the mo&s;t knowing Emperor of that Age; but al|&s;o the Brave&s;t and mo&s;t Glorious. In the mean time, the Univer&s;ity have taken him for their Pa|tron, and on the Day of his Fea&s;t, the Exerci&s;es cea&s;e in all Colledges. We &s;hall &s;ay nothing of its antient Splendor, nor of the Credit and Au|thority, which it formerly enjoyed. It is well known, that mo&s;t of the great Affairs, have been tran&s;acted by the advice of this Univer&s;ity, and that Kings have not di&s;dain'd to Con&s;ult it, in their mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ions. Popes them&s;elves have in a manner appeal'd hither, and have of|ten &s;ued for the Suffrages of this Univer&s;ity, to authori&s;e their Elections, and &s;upport them again&s;t Competitors.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Duboulay</HI> in the Hi&s;tory which he
<PB N="3" REF="90">
hath made of this Univer&s;ity in three Volumes, in Folio, makes mention of many Illu&s;trious Per|&s;ons, who have i&s;&s;ued from hence. It hath been &s;o numerous and &s;o full of Scholars, that we ought not to omit ob&s;erving here, one &s;urpri&s;|ing thing, which happened under <HI>Charles</HI> VI. That Prince being fallen into a Di&s;traction, pub|lick Prayers and Proce&s;&s;ions were appointed to be made for his Recovery. All the Companies and Communalties went afoot, in Proce&s;&s;ion to St. <HI>Denis</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and the Parliament, as the prin|cipal Body of the Kingdom, begun this Act of Piety. The Univer&s;ity had al&s;o their appointed day to go thither, and <HI>Juvenal des &V;r&s;ins</HI> records. That all the Scholars were obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t with their &s;everal Heads and Members, who belonged to them: He adds, That they all made &s;o great a number of Men, that the beginning of the Pro|ce&s;&s;ion, was entering into the Church of St <HI>Denis,</HI> when the Rector, who went la&s;t, was hardly gone out of the Church of the <HI>Mathu|rins,</HI> where they fir&s;t met together. The num|ber of Scholars and Colledges is now very much dimini&s;hed.

Of this you may read an Example in an Epitaph, in the <HI>Mathurins</HI> Cloi&s;ter. Two Scholars having done certain Crimes worthy of Death, were Executed by Sentence of the Provo&s;t of <HI>Paris:</HI> The Univer&s;ity conceiving them&s;elves wounded in this Sentence, &s;u&s;pended their Exer|ci&s;es, and by this means obliged the Provo&s;t of <HI>Paris,</HI> to bring back the Bodies of the&s;e two Scholars to the <HI>Mathurins,</HI> after he had him&s;elf taken them down from the Gallows at <HI>Montfau|con,</HI> where they there hung; and after he had ki&s;t their Cheeks, tho they had been Executed above four Months. There are many Examples of this &s;ort. But &s;ince that time things are very much changed; and though at pre&s;ent the Uni|ver&s;ity is full of Per&s;ons of great Learning, yet her Credit and Authority are mightily dimini&s;h|ed; e&s;pecially &s;ince about the middle of the la&s;t Age, &s;he has &s;uffered &s;ome Lo&s;&s;es, which &s;he will have much ado ever to repair.</P>

The Walls that enclo&s;e the Ground, are of a wonderful thickne&s;s and &s;olidity; and one would think, that the Holy Father would rather enclo&s;e a Citta|del,

than a Colledge of Religious Men; the Chapter-Hou&s;e is perfectly well Vaulted over|head, and at pre&s;ent &s;erves for their School. But that which is more Beautiful is the Structure of their Church, which ought to be con&s;idered as one of the faire&s;t <HI>Gothick</HI> Buildings in all <HI>France;</HI> its Roof is of an extraordinary heighth, with Chappels on each &s;ide. True it is, that but part of this great Work is fini&s;ht, by rea|&s;on of the Holy Father's Death, which hap|pened too &s;oon; however by his La&s;t Will be appointed, That what he had begun &s;hould be compleated, and to that end he left a Summ of Money; but that falling into the Hands of Rob|bers on the way, as they conveyed it into <HI>France,</HI> during tho&s;e Troubles, which happen|ed in the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> VI. the Work re|mained imperfect as it now is.

As you go out of the <HI>Bernardins,</HI> on the left Hand, you find the Church of St. <HI>Nicolas du Chardonnet,</HI> newly Rebuilt of a very hand&s;om De|&s;ign.

<P>The Church of St. <HI>E&s;tienne du Mont,</HI> a Pari&s;h Church. This Church is of &s;o old a Foundation, that it is not certainly known in what time it was fir&s;t Built. That Building which we &s;ee at pre&s;ent, was undertaken in the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, and after it had remain'd a long time imperfect, it was not fini&s;hed till under <HI>Henry</HI> IV.

The in&s;ide of this Church is very neat, and light&s;ome; the Roof is very high and well extended. There are between Pillar and Pillar, certain Arches that &s;upport Galleries of Communication, and turn about each Pillar with much Art.

But that which the Curious ought to ob&s;erve more carefully than all, is the Pulpit, which is of excellent Workman&s;hip, adorn'd with Sculptures and Bas-reliefs, of a wonderful De&s;ign and Performance.

<P>BEfore we write of the Curio&s;ities in this Hou&s;e, &s;omething ought to be &s;aid of its Foundation. <HI>Clovis,</HI> as &s;ome believe, was the fir&s;t Founder, and Dedicated it to St. <HI>Peter</HI> and St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who&s;e names it bore a long time. He placed here Secular Canons, who inhabited this Hou&s;e till the Reign of <HI>Lewis the Young,</HI> in the Eleventh Age, at which time the King con&s;train|ed them to take the Rule of St. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> and to live in Community, they having till then led very irregular Lives. To e&s;tabli&s;h this new Reform, &s;ome Per&s;ons were brought over from
<PB N="14" REF="96">
St. <HI>Victors,</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mezeray</HI> acquaints us with the Rea&s;ons, which occa&s;ioned that King to do this. He &s;ays, That of old time be|yond Memory, there were certain Secular Canons in this Hou&s;e, who had been by the Solicitation of King <HI>Robert the Religious,</HI> freed from the Vi&s;itation of the Bi&s;hop, and placed immediately under that of the Holy See: But it happenning that Pope <HI>Engenius</HI> the Fourth, flying for refuge into <HI>France,</HI> and Lodging in this Hou&s;e, there happened a Di&s;pute between the Canons and the Holy Father's Officers, on occa&s;ion, that the Canons would have taken to them&s;elves an Imbroidered Carpet, which the King pre&s;ented to his Holine&s;s, to hang before his <HI>Prie Dieu</HI> (or Seat in the Church) they pre|tending that it ought to belong to, and remain in their Church. The Controver&s;ie was &s;o hot, that they fell from Words to Blows, and the Canons being the &s;tronger Party, a&s;&s;aulted the Pope's Officers &s;o home, that they were &s;ome of them Kill'd. The King him&s;elf coming thither to appea&s;e the Tumult, thought he &s;hould have been Wounded in the di&s;order: To puni&s;h the Canons for this their in&s;olence, the King agreed with the Holy Father to Expel them from this Hou&s;e, and to give the care of the Re|form to <HI>Suger,</HI> Abbot of St. <HI>Denis;</HI> who thereupon drew off 12. Canons Regular from St. <HI>Victors,</HI> and placed them here in the room of the others. Af|ter this manner, the Chapter was changed into an Abby, who&s;e fir&s;t Abbot was called <HI>Odo.</HI> Since that time the Rule of St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> hath always been ob&s;erved here with much Purity, and this Hou&s;e is become the Chief of all the Congregation in <HI>France:</HI> The Abbot of which, with his four A&s;|&s;i&s;tants,
<PB N="15" REF="96">

This Abby had formerly a peculiar Juri&s;diction, like that of St. <HI>Germain des Prez;</HI> but in regard this was found to be the cau&s;e of much Di&s;order and Con|fu&s;ion, they were all united to the Body of the <HI>Ch&acirc;telet.</HI> Many Kings have been Benefactors to this Hou&s;e, but the greate&s;t was King <HI>Robert,</HI> who built the old Cloi&s;ter, which was taken down under <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t, who inclo&s;ed for them 17 Arpens (or Acres) of Land. The Hou&s;e hath been often ruined by the <HI>Normans</HI> and the <HI>Danes,</HI> while it was out of the Town; but the Devotion which the <HI>Pari&s;ians</HI> had for St. <HI>Gene|vi&eacute;ve,</HI> their Patrone&s;s, was the occa&s;ion that the Ruines made by tho&s;e Barbarous People, were repaired again in a very little time after. The Body of St. <HI>Genevi&eacute;ve</HI> is in the Shrine behind the great Altar, &s;upported by 4 Ionick Pillars, of an extraordinary &s;ort of Marble. The Che&s;t is of Silver-gilt, enricht with Precious Stones of very great value. Father <HI>du Bre&uuml;il,</HI> who hath Compo&s;ed a Volume <HI>Of the Antiquities of</HI> Paris, tells us, That this Shrine was made by the Libe|ralities of &s;everal pious Per&s;ons, and that the Gold&s;miths Work came to, One hundred four|&s;core and thirteen Marks of Silver, and Eight Marks and an half of Gold to gild it. The Queen Mother, decea&s;ed, who&s;e Piety will be a long time remember'd, in divers Parts of <HI>Paris,</HI> enricht this &s;hrine with No&s;egays compo&s;ed of Pre|cious Stones, of a very con&s;iderable price.

<P>In the Vault under this Church, you may &s;till &s;ee the Tomb of St. <HI>Genevi&eacute;ve,</HI> tho there remains therein nothing of her Body, which is all entire in the Shrine, with the very Boards of her Cof|fin. This Tomb is of Marble without any Or|nament. At one end, upon an Altar which &s;tands between two Pillars, is a Cro&s;s adorn'd with certain Agates, with an <HI>Ecce Homo</HI> at the Foot of it, of one intire piece of Coral, very well wrought. The&s;e things come from the Ca|binet of the Rev&cmbdot;erend Father <HI>du Molinet,</HI> who&s;e
<PB N="21" REF="99">
Pre&s;ent it was. There are two other Tombs very antient, of two Bi&s;hops of <HI>Paris,</HI> who dyed with the reputation of Sanctity, and who are invo|ked on the account of &s;ome particular Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>From hence you ought to go and &s;ee the <HI>Sacri|&s;ty,</HI> which you will find very well furni&s;ht with Ornaments of divers Colours very rich, and with a great quantity of Plate. There is no place in this Kingdom, and perhaps in all <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> where the divine Offices are Celebrated with more Devotion and Maje&s;ty, than in this Church: All the Religious are extreamly regu|lar, and one is much Edified to &s;ee them in the Ceremonies of the Church.</P>
<P>In the inward parts of the Hou&s;e there are ma|ny curious things, particularly as to the Archi|tecture; about ten years &s;ince they have made con&s;iderable Reparations. The great Gate was very inconvenient; and they have built another in the place, after the manner of a double Portico, &s;upported by Pillars of the Dorick Order, very re|gularly proportioned, with two Square Pavilions at the Extremities. Over again&s;t this Gate is a Fountain at the Feet of a Figure of St. <HI>Genevi&eacute;ve,</HI> in a kind of Niche or Arch, &s;et off with two Io|nick Pillars. After this we enter into the Cloi|&s;ter, or rather under a kind of Portico, &s;uppor|ted on both &s;ides with Dorick Pillars, like tho&s;e at the Entrance, but of a hand&s;omer Orderance. At the further end of this Portico, about thirty Paces long, &s;tands the great Stair-ca&s;e, which leads to the <HI>Dortoirs,</HI> at the further end of which is a Figure of the Holy Virgin, holding the In|fant <HI>JESUS</HI> in her Armes; it is of Excellent Workman&s;hip, as one may ea&s;ily perceive. The Dortoirs have nothing of Magnificent. Their
<PB N="22" REF="100">
only care is, that all things throughout the place &s;hould appear neat, as well as in the Low|er Rooms, in which you may &s;ee &s;everal Pictures of the antient Abbots of this Hou&s;e. The Gar|den is very plea&s;ant, it is the greate&s;t of all tho&s;e that were within the antient Walls of <HI>Paris.</HI> On that &s;ide next the Portico, of which we have been &s;peaking, you may go into a Chappel dedicated to the Holy Virgin, round which are hung &s;eve|ral Pictures of Devotion well Painted. In the middle of this Chappel is a Tomb about a Foot high, on which is the Figure in Bra&s;s of an anti|ent Bi&s;hop, in his Pontificial Habits. After you have &s;een the&s;e things, you ought to vi&s;it tho Apothecary-Room, which is extraordinary neat, and where there are &s;everal Curio&s;ities, for tho&s;e who are knowing in the&s;e matters.</P>
<P>From hence you ought to go up to the Library, which at pre&s;ent is e&s;teemed one of the faire&s;t and be&s;t furni&s;ht of <HI>Paris.</HI> It takes up the upper Room of one of tho&s;e four great Wings, which compo&s;e this building. It is, in truth, a little too high &s;cituated, but in recompen&s;e of that it is &s;o much the lighter. You have there a very great num|ber of Books, placed in Pre&s;&s;es of very hand&s;om Wain&s;cot, with the bu&s;ts of all the great Men of Antiquity, Coppied from tho&s;e at <HI>Ver&s;ailles.</HI> The Reverend Father <HI>du Molinet,</HI> one of the mo&s;t Learned and able Men of this Age, in the knowledge of Books, and in the curious &s;earch of Antiquity, hath the over-&s;ight and care in the&s;e matters. They pre&s;erve here a great quantity of Prints, part of which came from one called Mon&s;ieur <HI>Hacart,</HI> who was a very curious Per&s;on, and dying left all that he had Collected to St. <HI>Victors,</HI> St. <HI>Germains des Prez,</HI> and S. <HI>Ge|nevi&eacute;ve</HI>'s,
<PB N="23" REF="100">
but they have here a great many o|thers more rare and better kept.</P>
<P>At the end of the Library you enter into the Cabinet of the fore&s;aid Father, which is extra|ordinarily well furni&s;hed with Curio&s;ities; you may there find all &s;orts, but chiefly Meddals of Gold, Silver and of Bra&s;s bigger and le&s;&s;er, ve|ry well cho&s;en, and &s;ome of them extream rare. We ought to con&s;ider this &s;ett of Meddals, which this Father him&s;elf hath Collected, as the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t Compleat, in all <HI>France,</HI> next to that in the King's Cabinet.</P>
<P>Among other Extraordinary things, in a little Pre&s;s you may &s;ee certain con&s;ecrated Knives, with which the Antients u&s;ed to cut the Throats of their Victims; a great Platter in which they mixt Wheat, Flower, Oyl and Wine, with which they u&s;ed to rub the Bea&s;ts they Sacrificed; certain Sphinxes or Idols, found among the Mo|mies; Antique Keys; Stiles, or &s;teel Pens, which the <HI>Romans</HI> u&s;ed to write with; a Copper Ta|ble, to which are fa&s;tened &s;everal little Balls of the &s;ame Mettal, which may be placed as a Man plea&s;ed, the&s;e the Antients u&s;ed to ca&s;t account with; &s;everal &s;orts of Lacrimatories, or Gla&s;s-Viols, in which they u&s;ed to pre&s;erve the Tears of tho&s;e, who they hired on purpo&s;e to Weep at Funerals, with &s;everal little Copper Spoons that they made u&s;e of to gather the Tears up with, from Leather Aprons, which they wore before them at that time, on purpo&s;e for the Tears to fall in. In another little Pre&s;s on the Right Hand, are all &s;orts of Mea&s;ures for Liquids, and Weights to weigh things &s;old, according to the u&s;age of the Antients. In another, he keeps all the Graving Tools of <HI>Parmezan,</HI> with which that

Famous Graver u&s;ed to Counterfeit the old Me|dals of the Antients &s;o exactly, that the mo&s;t &s;kil|ful in this Art have been deceived, and have taken the Counterfeit Medals, made by that able Work|man, for true ones, and &s;tampt in the times of tho&s;e Men which they repre&s;ent. This was per|haps one of the Curiou&s;e&s;t Actions that could be done,. and tho&s;e who are &s;kilful in the&s;e mat|ters e&s;teem them much. Together with the&s;e things, you may &s;ee here &s;everal Peices of Op|ticks, invented by Father <HI>Ni&s;eron,</HI> a Minim, of whom we have formerly made mention; the Poot of a &s;mall Mummy, very well pre&s;erved; cer|tain extraordinary Fi&s;hes; and another Rarity, which in the Ages pa&s;t, was e&s;teemed an entire Trea&s;ure of it &s;elf, and that is a great Unicorn's Horn, white as Ivory, five or &s;ix Poot in heighth, and of a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, it is no le&s;s Beau|tiful than that in the Trea&s;ury at St. <HI>Denis;</HI> for which, as it is &s;aid, the Republick of <HI>Venice</HI> did once offer, One hundred thou&s;and Crowns, to have Pre&s;ented it to a King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> In another &s;mall Cabinet, there are all &s;orts of Rich Stones, Shells and Minerals exceeding rare, and &s;uch like things. Over again&s;t the Door, where you en|ter, are divers kinds of Habits, made of the Feathers of Paroquets, and other Birds, wrought together with great Art, and brought from <HI>Ame|rica;</HI> a Cuira&s;s and a Cor&s;elet of <HI>Japan,</HI> made of Verni&s;h, and of an unu&s;ual &s;hape; a Sheild made of Silk, probably coming from the &s;ame Country; and that which can hardly be &s;een el&s;ewhere, a great number of Shoes belonging to almo&s;t all Nations in the Levant, extreamly different in Shape, from what we wear. There is al&s;o a Chain made of Wood, very light and very long,

all made out of one piece; &s;everal petrified things very curious; and among the re&s;t one Stone com|po&s;ed of divers Pieces, in &s;uch manner, that we cannot di&s;cern, whether it be the production of Art or Nature. There are many other Rari|ties to ob&s;erve, as the Jaw of a Fi&s;h, of extraor|dinary greatne&s;s, having in it &s;everal Rows of &s;harp Teeth; &s;everal good Pictures, with divers other rare and well Collected things. This Re|verend Father is not only knowing in the&s;e mat|ters, but he hath Written &s;everal Learned Pieces, as, <HI>A Defence of</HI> Thomas a Kempis; <HI>A Di&s;|cour&s;e upon the Bra&s;s-Head, which was found at Mon&s;ieur</HI> Berrier<HI>'s; The Hi&s;tory of the Popes by their Medals; The Works of</HI> Stephen de Tourney, augmented very con&s;iderably with divers Pieces, never. yet Printed; and a learned Commentary, which clears many ob&s;cure places, which would have &s;carcely been under&s;tood without his A&s;&s;i|&s;tance; and in fine, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of the Roman Learn|ing e&s;tab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;hed, and ju&s;tified by many Excellent Antiqui|ties,</HI> which la&s;t he has publi&s;ht this pre&s;ent Year, 1684.

La&s;tly, here is the Tomb of the two Scholars, named <HI>Leger Mou&s;&s;el,</HI> and <HI>Oliver Bourgeois,</HI> who were hang'd at <HI>Montfaulcon</HI> in the Year 1408, on the 17th. of <HI>May,</HI> by Sentence of the Provo&s;t of <HI>Paris,</HI> without regard to the Priviledges of the Univer&s;ity; who afterwards demanded that famous Satisfaction, which we have already &s;poken off in the 4th. Folio of this Second Part. Of late they have made many Con&s;iderable De|corations in this Church. The great Altar is a|dorn'd with Pillars of a kind of reddi&s;h Marble, very rare. The little Tabernacle upon that Altar is al&s;o very Beautiful: So are the two le&s;&s;er Al|tars on each &s;ide of the great one, adorn'd with Pillars very well wrought. The Quire of this Church is &s;eparated from the Nave by a kind of Balu&s;trade, or rather by &s;ix Ionick Pillars of Marble, &s;upporting a Corni&s;h, on which there are &s;everal little Figures of Angels, very well de&s;ign|ed. The re&s;t of the Church is Wain&s;coted with Joyners Work, full of Sculpture, with a great number of Grenades, which are the Arms of the pre&s;ent General of the Order, who hath been at the Expence of all the&s;e new Reparations. The Univer&s;ity a&s;&s;emble in the Chapter-Hou&s;e of this Convent, when they make their Proce&s;&s;ions; which u&s;ually happens every three Months, at which the Rector is con&s;tantly pre&s;ent. He is al&s;o obliged to give a Summ of Money to all tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;t at the Ceremony. The&s;e Proce&s;&s;ions ought to be &s;een and ob&s;erved by Strangers, and are well worth their Curio&s;ity; the Show being very numerous, and di&s;po&s;ed in excellent Order. The four Faculties are obliged to appear there, in the proper and peculiar Habits belonging to them. The Money which the Rector di&s;bur&s;es
<PB N="35" REF="106">
on this occa&s;ion, ari&s;es out of the Revenues of the Univer&s;ity, which amount to the Summ of Fifty thou&s;and Franks, ari&s;ing out of the Me&s;&s;ageries (or Carriage of Goods) between certain Towns of this Kingdom, and al&s;o from &s;everal Hou&s;es Situated in divers places of <HI>Paris.</HI> Formerly they po&s;&s;e&s;t much greater Revenues, but they have been lo&s;t by the negligence of tho&s;e, who of late Years have had the Admini&s;tration of their affairs.

<P><HI>The Church of Saint Benoit,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to be Founded by St. <HI>Denis,</HI> who Dedicated it to the Holy Trinity; if &s;o, none can doubt it to be of very great Antiquity. It is po&s;&s;e&s;t by Canons Secular, who are obliged on the great Fea&s;ts to accompany the Canons of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame,</HI> when they make their grand Proce&s;&s;ions. The Build|ing or Structure of this Church is nothing Beau|tiful, as being carried up at &s;everal times and by pieces. The Nave was built in the Reign of <HI>Fran|cis</HI> the Fir&s;t, and four years &s;ince the Quire was Rebuilt anew very hand&s;omly. The in&s;ide is embelli&s;ht with Corinthian Pila&s;ters, which &s;up|port a Corni&s;h of a very good Gu&s;t. This Church is very light&s;ome, and has not now the defect which it &s;ometimes had; which was, that the great Altar was contrived on the We&s;t &s;ide; &s;ince, when it was new built in the la&s;t Age, they quite changed that Di&s;po&s;ition; which occa&s;ion'd that it has been call'd, <HI>St. Benoi&s;t le bien tourn&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>St. Bennet's the well contrived.</HI> For in tho&s;e days they were very exact, in contriving the Churches Ea&s;t and We&s;t, even to a kind of Scruple.</P>

He intended to have rai&s;ed here a great Building, but his de&s;ign being never executed, becau&s;e of his great Expences in the Wars, which he had on all the Frontiers of his Kingdom, e&s;pecially in <HI>Italy;</HI> he left the Work to be done by his Son <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, who neglected, or at lea&s;t had not a Conveniency of doing it. The Profe&s;&s;ors all the while read their Lectures in the Colledge of <HI>Cambray,</HI> and remain'd in this Condition till under the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the Great, who in the Year 1609. on the 23. of <HI>November,</HI> &s;ent the Cardinal <HI>du Perron,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Suilly,</HI> fir&s;t Mini&s;ter, the Pre&s;ident <HI>de Thou,</HI> and a Coun&s;ellor of Parliament named Mon&s;i|eur <HI>Gillot,</HI> to view the Situation of the place, and if there was &s;ufficient Room, to rai&s;e the Building projected. It &s;hould have been com|po&s;ed of a main Front, and on each Hand two Wings, with a Court, in the mid&s;t of which &s;hould have been a Fountain.

Queen <HI>Mary</HI> of <HI>Medieis</HI> his Illu&s;trious Wife, to &s;econd the Zeal of the King her Husband, re|&s;olved to fini&s;h what he had begun; and to that purpo&s;e &s;he her &s;elf with her Son <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. at that time but nine Years old, went to the place. The Young King laid the fir&s;t Stone, and the Work was carried on with fervency; but in the end it was once again broke off, and re|mains as we &s;ee it, having never been thought of, to be continued, from that time to this. There is but one &s;ide fini&s;ht, and that &s;tands in the &s;ame place, where formerly &s;tood the Colledge called <HI>de Treguier.</HI> The Profe&s;&s;ors are paid by the King, and are a kind of Body di&s;tinct from the Univer&s;ity, to which, however, they are &s;ub|ject. They enjoy the &s;ame Priviledges with the Officers of the King's Hou&s;ehold; and the Re|ctor of the Univer&s;ity is not permitted to di&s;po&s;e their places, nor to prohibit their Exerci&s;es, which he may do to all other Profe&s;&s;ors.

Over the Door go|ing into the Sacri&s;ty, is a Picture of <HI>Valentine's,</HI> repre&s;enting the Nativity of the Holy Virgin; which Piece Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI> gave, to be placed over the great Altar; but when he perceived it to be too little, he left it to the Church, and it hath been placed here ever &s;ince.

St. <HI>Bennet</HI>'s Order, which was fir&s;t Founded in the &s;ame place, where at pre&s;ent &s;tands St. <HI>Bartholo|mew</HI>'s Church, near the Pallace. But tho&s;e good Religious Men, being troubled with the noi&s;e and Clutter of that place, changed their habitation in the Year 1138. and came to dwell here, which was at that time a good way out of the Town, where there was already a Chapel built and de|dicated to St. <HI>George.</HI> After that in the Year 1549. The Monks of St. <HI>Bennet</HI> did altogether quit this Hou&s;e, and transfer'd them&s;elves to o|ther Hou&s;es of the &s;ame Order, the Revenue of this being given to the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> And in the Room of the Monks they placed here certain <HI>Penitent Nuns,</HI> but they continued not long.

The&s;e Nuns teach freely young Girles not only to Read and Write, but al&s;o &s;eve|ral &s;orts of Works proper for them, which is of great advantage to the publick.

the Building is, in truth, very antient, but the modern Ornaments within it make &s;ufficient amends for that. As you go in you may ob&s;erve, that it is all painted in imitation of black Mar|ble vein'd with White; and that the Balu&s;trades or Partitions of the Chapels are of a Wain&s;cot, extraordinary finely gilt: But the mo&s;t curious things of all are the great Pictures placed under every Window, in Frames richly Carved and gilt. There are &s;ix of the&s;e Pictures on each &s;ide, each repre&s;enting &s;ome principal Pa&s;|&s;age of the New Te&s;tament. They are the Work of the famou&s;e&s;t Painters of this Age.

The Fifth is Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Brun</HI>'s; and the Sixth repre&s;enting the Transfiguration, is <HI>de la Hire</HI>'s. Tho&s;e on the other &s;ide were all done by <HI>Champaign,</HI> and that able Ma&s;ter never made any better Pieces than the&s;e, as one may ea&s;ily ob&s;erve. The Al|tar of this Church &s;tands very high, and is all of Marble, as well the body of the Work as the Pil|lars, which are of the Corinthian Order, their Ca|pitals of Bra&s;s gilt.

The Saint is repre&s;ented weeping under a Rock, tearing her Hair and Ornaments, and trampling them under Foot, her Eyes are all drown'd in Tears, through which her Complection but faintly ap|pears; briefly, one cannot imagine a piece of Painting more feelingly expre&s;t and none can &s;ee it without more compa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch a Penitent.

<P>It ought to be ob&s;erved that the Nuns of <HI>Val de Grace</HI> were formerly Founded near the Village of <HI>Bierre,</HI> about Three Leagues from <HI>Paris,</HI> in a very incommodious place by rea&s;on of the Ma|ri&s;h Grounds, called there <HI>le Val profond,</HI> or the deep Vale; being very Sickly in this place, they Petition'd <HI>Lewis</HI> XIII. for his permi&s;&s;ion to come and inhabit in <HI>Paris.</HI> Queen <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> his Illu&s;trious Wife, being acquainted with their merit, chiefly from one of their Company, named <HI>Margaret d'Arbou&s;e,</HI> by who&s;e means &s;he took a particular affection to them, declar'd her &s;elf their Foundre&s;s.

<P>Fir&s;t you enter into a great Court, which lies before the principal Door; this Court is &s;epara|ted from the Street by a Palli&s;ade of Iron, at the extremities of which are two &s;quare Pavillions; on the right Hand and on the left it is bounded with certain Stone Works, adorn'd with ru&s;tick Pillars, which make a very hand&s;om Shew. At the further part of this Court is the great Portal, rai&s;ed upon Six &s;teps. But that which makes it mo&s;t remarkable, is, that it is after the manner of a Portico compo&s;ed of Four great Corinthian Pillars, with Niches on each &s;ide, in which are placed St. <HI>Bennet,</HI> and St. <HI>Schola&s;tica,</HI> of white

<Q>To the Child JES&V;S, and his Virgin Mo|ther.</Q>
<P>The Front of the Portal is of two Orders of Pillars, the Corinthian and the Compo&s;ite, with all their proper Ornaments. If the out&s;ide appears great, the in&s;ide is &s;till infinitly more magnificent. All the Church is paved with Marble of divers Colours. And the compartments are corre&s;pon|dent to the <HI>Cartouches</HI> of Sculpture, and to the <HI>Guillochis</HI> (or Flouri&s;hings) in the Roof, where there are &s;everal Ba&s;-tailles of admirable Work|man&s;hip. This Roof is of Stone as white as Mar|ble, and it is throughout enriched with Orna|ments of the be&s;t &s;ort, in which Mon&s;ieur <HI>An|guerre</HI> has &s;urpa&s;t all. On each &s;ide of the Nave are Three Chapels, divided a&s;under by Two great Pila&s;ters, which &s;upport the Corni&s;h that runs round the Church, and &s;upports the Arches of the Roof. The Quire is directly un|der the Dome at the further end of the Nave, from which it is parted only by a grate of Iron gilt. Four great Arches &s;upport the Dome; and the great Altar is placed under the futher|mo&s;t Arch. It is of a very &s;ingular de&s;ign, com|po&s;ed of Six great twi&s;ted Pillars of the Compo&s;ite Order. They are of black Marble vein'd with

One may truly &s;ay that the contrivance of the&s;e Pillars is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, more magnificent, than tho&s;e of the great Altar at St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s in <HI>Rome,</HI> which were de&s;igned by the Cavalier <HI>Bernin.</HI> The&s;e excel in number and in the beauty of the Workman&s;hip.

The whole is of the be&s;t &s;ort of gilding without any Colours Upon the Altar, which is placed in the middle of the&s;e Pillars, the Infant <HI>JESUS</HI> is repre&s;ented lying in his Cradle, all of white Marble, accompanied by the Holy Virgin and St. <HI>Jo&s;eph&punc;</HI> the&s;e are all of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Anguerre</HI>'s Work, and reckoned among the be&s;t things that ever he did.

Mathematicians. It con&s;i&s;ts of a great Body of Stone-work two Stories high; the Windows of which are round at the top, and about fourteen Toi&s;es high (a Toi&s;e is Six Foot.) The forepart of the Building is made with Towers Eight An|gular of the &s;ame height, with a great E&s;planade in manner of a Tarra&s;s, with fronts about the whole Building. The Tower on the Ea&s;t &s;ide is open at the top, and without any Roof, that &s;o one may &s;ee the better from the bottom. Between the&s;e two Towers are &s;everal great Rooms, which are not yet furni&s;ht with &s;uch things as are to be there. But that which is mo&s;t remarkable in this Building, is, that there is not u&s;ed about it either Iron or Wood, and yet the Roof of it is extreamly &s;olid. The Stair-ca&s;e is the fine&s;t that can be imagined; it is all of Stone laid after a way extraordinary, hardy and bold from the bottom to the top; and the Iron Rail that winds the whole length of the&s;e Stairs is very well wrought. It is 156 Steps high and leads to the Tarra&s;s. In regard this Building con&s;i&s;ts of &s;eve|ral &s;tories, it hath &s;everal vaulted Roofs one over the other, the uppermo&s;t of which con&s;i&s;ts of an Arch of a large extent, flat on the out&s;ide, and paved with Hint-&s;tones, cut exactly and bound together with Cement, that the Rain may not penetrate and damnifie the Vaults be|neath.

But it &s;eems it fails of effect, for no body has yet &s;een them, tho' it hath been often endeavour'd.

There are only Four Mathematicians who lodge in the Ob&s;erva|tory, part of tho&s;e who compo&s;e the Academy of Sciences, e&s;tabli&s;hed at the King's Cabinet, as we have formerly noted; and they are M. <HI>Ca&s;sini,</HI> originally an <HI>Italian,</HI> and formerly one of the great Dukes Academy at <HI>Florence,</HI> where he had attain'd great Reputation.

The Street which lies before the Hou&s;e does &s;till retain the old name, and it is for this rea&s;on that it was fir&s;t; called the <HI>R&uuml;e d'Enfer</HI> (or Hell Street.) But &s;ince the&s;e good Fathers became po&s;&s;e&s;t of the place, they quickly expell'd the evil Spirits; and St. <HI>Lewis</HI> having a great e&s;teem of the Au&s;tere and Holy Life that they led, made them a Vi&s;it with his whole Court, and confer'd upon them &s;ufficient Lands and Deme&s;nes for their Sub&s;i&s;tence. Many per&s;ons did contribute to the building of their Hou&s;e, which takes up more Ground than any other Religious Hou&s;e does at pre&s;ent in all the Town and Suburbs of <HI>Paris.</HI> Be&s;ides that the Cells are large, and that they have each a &s;eparate Garden; they have al&s;o a great Clo&s;e containing many <HI>Arpens</HI> of Land, which encompa&s;&s;es the whole Hou&s;e.

<P>The little Cloi&s;ter which lies on one &s;ide of this Church, is the only thing that is rare and &s;ingu|lar belonging to the&s;e fathers. It is adorn'd with a Dorick Architecture of Pila&s;ter fa&s;hion.

The Pictures which hang at the Corners of the Cloi|&s;ter, repre&s;ent the views of &s;everal remarkable places, among others of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> of the <HI>Grand Chartreu&s;e</HI> near <HI>Grenoble,</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> on the Louvre &s;ide as it &s;hew'd before the old Tow|er was taken down, and the <HI>Port-neuve,</HI> which &s;tood not far from the <HI>Pont-rouge;</HI> the re&s;t are only fancies of the Painter. All the Painting of this Cloi&s;ter was done by <HI>Le Sueur,</HI> who never did any thing finer than the&s;e Pieces here. Of late days they have contrived Wooden Shuts in which they &s;hut them up, that they may not be inju|red, as certain per&s;ons who envy the Merit and Reputation of that incomparable Man, have at|tempted to do. They do not open the&s;e Pictures but upon certain Days, or when Curious Peo|ple de&s;ire to &s;ee them.

The&s;e Cells are compo&s;ed of Four or Five &s;mall Rooms all on a Floor, Boarded throughout, and very &s;imply furni&s;ht. Some of the&s;e Fathers have by them very curious Libra|ries, the Father <HI>Vicar</HI> hath one which is much e&s;teemed. Some of them employ them&s;elves in|du&s;triou&s;ly in divers Works, thereby to pa&s;s more ea&s;ily their time of Solitude, which is very rigorous in regard they are never permitted to go out of the Hou&s;e, nor to receive any Vi&s;its but at certain hours. And it is well and judici|ou&s;ly ob&s;erved by one of our Hi&s;torians, that the principal rea&s;on why the&s;e Fathers have pre&s;erved the purity of their fir&s;t In&s;titute better than the other Orders, is becau&s;e they have always &s;hun'd with extream care the great Commerce of the World, and the Vi&s;its of Women: Two Dangerous Rocks for the Mona&s;tick Life.</P>

On the Right Hand in this Court is the Chapel belonging to the Colledge of <HI>Clugni.</HI> It takes up almo&s;t one &s;ide of this Court, and makes no unhand&s;om Show, although it be of Go|thick building; but gives the Beholder occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure, the difference between that gro&s;s and Ru&s;tick &s;ort of building in the Ages pa&s;t, and the regular and &s;tudied manner now u&s;ed in this. As you enter into this open place or Court, and ca&s;t your Eyes upon
<PB N="73" REF="125">
the Portal of the Church, you cannot de&s;ire a finer object. The proportions are &s;o true, and the points of the view &s;o well contrived, that the di&s;tant parts of this Edifice &s;eem to &s;tand over the Portal, and to be placed in the &s;tand|ing where they are, to &s;erve for a greater Or|nament to the Front. The Dome is none of the highe&s;t. It is accompanied like that of <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> with Four little ones, with Statues, with bands of Lead gilt, and with a Balu&s;trade of Iron about the little Lanthorn which is on the top of all the work. All the&s;e different things do agree &s;o well one with another, that one can|not wi&s;h to &s;ee a more beautiful piece of Ar|chitecture. The Portal of the Church con&s;i&s;ts of Two orders of Pillars, Corinthian, and Com|po&s;ite. The &s;econd Story are only Pila&s;ters. Both above and below, between the Pillars, are Niches, in which are placed Statues of very good Workman&s;hip; as al&s;o are tho&s;e on the out&s;ide, and tho&s;e within, between the Corinthian Pila|&s;ters that &s;upport the Roof. The in&s;ide of the Church is but &s;mall, and is not altogether &s;o light as it might have been; however, all things there are well di&s;po&s;ed: The Pavement is of Marble: The Dome is very well painted, and &s;o are the Four Fathers of the Church which are between the Arcades that &s;u&s;tain it; the&s;e are in Fre&s;quo, and of colours very &s;hining. The great Altar is not yet begun; but doubt|le&s;s it will be magnificent, if they follow the de|&s;igns which are &s;hewn: It is to be all of Mar|ble, compo&s;ed of Six great Pillars of Ja&s;per, with their Capitals and other Ornaments gilt. The le&s;&s;er Altars, which are already fini&s;hed, do promi&s;e, that if the great Altar be of the
<PB N="74" REF="126">
&s;ame gu&s;t, one cannot &s;ee any thing more deli|cate. The Altar of the Virgin was fini&s;h'd not long ago; it is of white Marble, with Orna|ments of Bra&s;s gilt, which &s;hew admirably. From hence we ought to go into the inward parts of the Hou&s;e, in the mid&s;t of which is a &s;quare Court encompa&s;t about with Buildings, part of which are higher than the re&s;t, which gives an air of Grandeur and Maje&s;ty to the Portico of the Church. As you &s;ee it on this &s;ide, hardly can any thing appear better: At the bot|tom of this Court it appears rai&s;ed upon Fifteen &s;teps, and con&s;i&s;ts of ten great Corinthian Pillars, di&s;tant from the building more than Six Foot: The&s;e Pillars &s;upport a Fronton in which are the Armes of Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> with two Statues on each &s;ide. On the Free&s;e you read this In|&s;cription:</P>

with that of the <HI>Rotundae</HI> in <HI>Rome:</HI> The Archi|tect has imitated it as near as he could. All the Apartments about this Court are inhabited by the Doctors of this Hou&s;e, who have a particular right to dwell here. Some of the&s;e Doctors have very pretty Libraries of their own, but the&s;e are not &s;o ea&s;ie to be &s;een as the great Library which is common to all the Hou&s;e, where all the Doctors &s;tudy. It is very long and very high, and runs over the head of two great ground Rooms, in which the Sorbonni&s;ts maintain their The&s;es and Di&s;putations. M. <HI>le Ma&s;le,</HI> Prior <HI>des Roches,</HI> and Secretary to Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu,</HI> gave the greate&s;t part of the Books you &s;ee here, which are very good ones. Mon&s;ieur the Cardinal gave his al&s;o, among which are &s;ome very rare Manu&s;cripts, di&s;tin|gui&s;ht from others by his Armes on the Covers; among the re&s;t, there is one of <HI>Titus Livius</HI> in two great Folio Volumes, written in Parchment, it is of an old Tran&s;lation into French about the Reign of <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, adorn'd with Mineatures at the beginning of every Chapter, and with Flouri&s;hes in the Margin, which are curiou&s;ly Painted with that delicate Gold colour, the &s;ecret of which has been lo&s;t for the&s;e two la&s;t Ages, it having been formerly u&s;ed as an ordina|ry Colour, and is of &s;uch an admirable brightne&s;s that it never &s;ullies. Be&s;ides this there are ma|ny other very rare Manu&s;cripts in one of the Pre&s;&s;es at the end, on that &s;ide next the Chim|ney, mo&s;t of them bound in red Turkey Lea|ther.

together with great care. At each end there is a Chimney, over which are placed the Pi|ctures of Mon&s;ieur the Cardinal in his Ceremo|nious habit, and of Mon&s;ieur <HI>le Ma&s;le,</HI> both in their full length; over that next the door is a Bu&s;t of the Cardinal, in Bra&s;s, wrought by the Sieur <HI>Varin,</HI> which came from among the Goods of the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Aiguillon,</HI> who after her death bequeath'd this, with other Goods, to this Hou&s;e, &s;he having had the u&s;e of them during her Life, by the Will of the Cardinal <HI>de Richelieu</HI> her Un|cle. There is al&s;o another le&s;&s;er Library in a private place of the Hou&s;e, but it contains only tho&s;e Books of which there has happen'd to be two of a &s;ort in the great Library, or &s;uch as the other Library cannot hold, in regard the number does increa&s;e daily, becau&s;e mo&s;t Au|thors pre&s;ent their Works here. The King him&s;elf hath pre&s;ented to this place all the curi|ous Prints which he has cau&s;ed to be graved, of which there are four or five great Volumes in Folio, neatly bound, which are the Carou&s;el, the Tapi&s;tries, the curious Di&s;&s;ections which have been made at the Academy of Sciences, and &s;ome others; in &s;uch &s;ort as this Library ought to be e&s;teem'd as one of the be&s;t and mo&s;t numerous that can be &s;een, tho' it be not yet quite perfected. But it is with this as with others which are in greater e&s;teem, it being almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to render any one Library compleat, be|cau&s;e of the difficulty of recovering &s;ome &s;carce Books, which oftentimes make the chief beauty of a&punc; Library, and which cannot be met with without mighty pains.

<P>The <HI>Street of St. Andrew des Arcs.</HI> The Pari&s;h Church which gives name to this Street is con&s;i|derable for &s;everal things, which the Curious will meet with in it.

<HEAD>The Abby of St. <HI>Germain des Prez.</HI></HEAD>
<P>KIng <HI>Childebert,</HI> Son of the Great <HI>Clouis</HI> was the Founder. Mon&s;ieur de <HI>Mezeray</HI> re|ports the particulars of the Foundation, and tells us, That that King being in <HI>Spain</HI> in the year 543. in a War again&s;t the <HI>Vi&s;igoths,</HI> he laid Siege to the Town of <HI>Sarrago&s;&s;a</HI> in which they were refu|ged: the Inhabitants finding them&s;elves &s;evere|ly pre&s;t by the <HI>French,</HI> and thinking in imitation of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> to move their Enemies by &s;ome &s;urprizing Action, they concluded to make a Proce&s;&s;ion about their Walls, in which they carried the Coat and other Reliques of St. <HI>Vin|cent.</HI> At this &s;ight <HI>Childebert</HI> was &s;o effective|ly concern'd, that he yeilded &s;o far, that he was contented to depart with certain Pre&s;ents which the Bi&s;hop made him, among other things that Coat, and tho&s;e Reliques of St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> which he brought with him to <HI>Paris,</HI> and to the honour of them built the Church, of which we are now about to &s;peak.</P>
<P>This Abby hath had &s;everal Names; it was &s;ometime called St. <HI>Croix,</HI> becau&s;e of a piece of
<PB N="90" REF="134">
that Holy Wood placed here among the other Reliques which he brought with him: at pre&s;ent it bears the name of St. <HI>Germain,</HI> who was Abbot here, and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris,</HI> and is here interr'd. On his Fe&s;tival day, which is the 28th of <HI>May,</HI> they expo&s;e to publick view his Shrine, which is of Silver gilt, adorn'd with a great quantity of Precious Stones: It is of a Gothick kind of Work, but as curious and hand&s;ome as one can &s;ee. All that remains of <HI>Childebert</HI>'s Building is the principal Gate at the end of the Church, and the great Steeple over it, which appear ve|ry ancient. The Statues of the Kings and Queens which are on the &s;ides of this Gate, are of &s;uch a de&s;ign as di&s;covers that in that Age the Gu&s;t of good Sculpture was not known; for we can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h whether the Statues re|pre&s;ent Men or Women. The Tomb of the aforementioned King is in the middle of the Quire, rai&s;ed about two foot and an half, with &s;ome In&s;criptions added to it when they removed it hither from St. <HI>Germain</HI>'s Chapel, where it for|merly was behind the Quire. This tran&s;lation hapned about thirty or forty years ago, when the Church was Repair'd and Beautified as it now is. At the &s;ame time they made over it a Vault of Stone in&s;tead of one of Wain&s;cot as was be|fore, and adorned the Pillars that &s;upported it with <HI>Corinthian</HI> Capitals. This Church is not lookt upon at pre&s;ent, as any Curio&s;ity, yet is the Di&s;po&s;ition of its parts well enough. The Great Altar is in the middle of the <HI>Croi&s;&eacute;e;</HI> and &s;o con|trived, that one may go round it: In the fore|part of this Altar is a Table of Silver gilt, which is a great Ornament, and is &s;hewed only on Fe&s;tival Days. It is adorn'd with the Figures

of the Apo&s;tles, and a Crucifix in the middle, of an ancient &s;ort of Work, not unhand&s;om.

<P>But without tarrying long in viewing the&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> things, you ought to go to the Library, which takes up all the upper Room of that Arm of the Cloi&s;ter next the Church. It is, in truth, none of the fulle&s;t, but in recompence of that, all the Books are the choice&s;t and of the be&s;t Editions that can be met with. In the la&s;t Age, when there was not &s;uch plenty of Libraries as at pre&s;ent, this here, was e&s;teemed the principal Library of <HI>Paris.</HI> And at this day, if it doth not continue all out of the &s;ame reputation for Printed Books, yet for Manu&s;cripts none will di&s;pute the precedency, of which we can no where meet with &s;o great a Quantity nor &s;uch Choice ones, unle&s;s it be in the King's Library. The&s;e Ma|nu&s;cripts are kept at the further end, in a little Chamber by them&s;elves; which Room is full of them from the top to the bottom. Here are &s;ome of all Subjects, but chiefly of Religion; by means of which great Lights, &s;everal faults of Printers and ill Copiers have been di&s;cover|ed and amended. In a little Pre&s;s in the great Library, they pre&s;erve &s;everal Volumes more choice and rare than the re&s;t; among&s;t which is one called <HI>The P&s;alter of St.</HI> Germain; it be|ing &s;uppo&s;ed to have been u&s;ed by that Saint, who lived about the Year 560. in the Reign of <HI>Childebert,</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> Em|peror in the Ea&s;t.

<P>Of all the Hou&s;es in <HI>Paris,</HI> and even in the whole Kingdom; there is none more regular, better de&s;ign'd for Architecture, or more mag|nificent than this Palace. <HI>Mary de Medicis,</HI> Wi|dow of <HI>Henry</HI> IV. cau&s;ed it to be built, and for that purpo&s;e made u&s;e of the able&s;t Arti&s;t of her time, named <HI>Jacques de Bro&s;se,</HI> the &s;ame per|&s;on who de&s;igned the Portal of St. <HI>Gervais,</HI> of which I have already &s;poken.

All Foreign Tra|vellers do agree, that in all <HI>Italy,</HI> there is no|thing to be &s;een, where Art hath been ob&s;erved with more exactne&s;s, and where more Grandeur and Maje&s;ty appears, than in this building.

On each &s;ide of the fore&s;aid Court are two long Galleries a little lower than the re&s;t of the Building, each &s;upported with 9 Arches, under which one may walk dry round about the Court. The Front of all this Palace is after the manner of an open Gallery, with a kind of Dome in the middle &s;upported with Pillars, under which is the great

The Architecture of this Palace con&s;i&s;ts of Pila&s;ters, except about the great Portal, and on the Garden &s;ide before a little Dome, which &s;erves for a Chapel, where are &s;ome Pillars which &s;tand off from the Work. The Orders ob&s;erved in this Work are the Tu&s;|can, and the Dorick, with an Attique above; and on the Garden &s;ide over the Tu&s;can and Dorick, is an Ionick, which makes a third Or|der compleat, with Balu&s;trades round about the top; as al&s;o Frontons and Faces, on which are great Statues in cumbent po&s;tures, &s;upporting Crowns. This excellent Architecture is &s;till more beautiful, by rea&s;on of the <HI>Bo&s;&s;age</HI> that runs all over the Work, no other Ornaments being nece&s;&s;ary. All that you &s;ee here is ac|cording to the plain and true Rules of Art, which is the cau&s;e that all tho&s;e who are any thing knowing in Architecture, take more delight in con&s;idering this Palace, and ob&s;erve more beau|ties in it, than tho&s;e who regard only the things without knowing the true value.

<P>Chancellor <HI>Seguier</HI> declared him&s;elf their Pro|tector, and became a great Benefactor; among other things he gave them wherewithal to build their great Altar; which is of a very hand&s;ome de&s;ign, adorned with Corinthian Pillars of black Marble, and &s;everal Figures repre&s;enting the principal Saints of this Order. All the Church is of the Tu&s;can order of building; yet, in truth, it is none of the mo&s;t regular. In the middle there is a Dome, painted in the top by a Chanon of the Church of <HI>Leige,</HI> named <HI>Bertolet,</HI> who was no bad Painter, as one may well judge by this Work; which repre&s;ents the A&s;|&s;umption of <HI>Elias,</HI> in a Chariot of Fire, and his Mantle falling on his Di&s;ciple <HI>Eli&s;ha,</HI> who receives it with open Arms.</P>
<P>There are in this Church two Chapels that de&s;erve a particular con&s;ideration. The fir&s;t of which is on the left hand, under the Dome, and Dedicated to the Holy Virgin; in which there is a Statue of white Marble, the fine&s;t that can be &s;een: It was made at <HI>Rome,</HI> by a Di&s;ciple of the Famous Cavalier <HI>Bernin,</HI> and co&s;t a great expence to bring it from thence.

not ea&s;ie ever to meet with a better figure than this. It repre&s;ents the Holy Virgin &s;itting and holding her Infant on her Knee, who &s;miles and extends his little Arms to embrace her. All that one can wi&s;h to &s;ee in a compleat and fini&s;ht Statue, is to be found in this; and all Men ought to con&s;ider it as the be&s;t Piece in the Kingdom.

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> Hotel Royal, <HI>called</HI> Les Inva|lides.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the King's Buildings, there is not any in which there appears more of mag|nificence and piety together than in this, &s;ince all that prodigious expence which hath been be|&s;tow'd on this Work is &s;olely intended for the maintenance of crippled Souldiers; who being di&s;abled to &s;erve any longer in the Army, would be forced to lead a Langui&s;hing and Mi&s;erable life, were it not for the &s;upport which they find in this Hou&s;e, where they are &s;upply'd with all things, and may end the cour&s;e of their Lives in the Exerci&s;e of Chri&s;tian Piety. But that which is not a little &s;urpri&s;ing is, that all this va&s;t Edifice was compleated, as it now is, in le&s;s than Eight Years, and in the height of the War.</P>
<P>About the Year 16**. they began to lay the fir&s;t Foundations of this curious Structure, which at pre&s;ent makes one of the Chief Orna|ments of <HI>Paris.</HI> It is exactly &s;quare, and con|tains in its Circumference five Courts of the &s;ame Figure, one great one in the middle, and two le&s;&s;er on each &s;ide, all which are compa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t about with Apartments, in which the Souldiers have their &s;everal Lodgings. That in the mid|dle is much greater than the re&s;t, and the build|ings about it are of a hand&s;om Symmetry. They are compo&s;ed of two rows of Arches, one above the other, which makes &s;o many Corridors or
<PB N="123" REF="150">
Galleries, by means of which you may walk dry round the Court. The top of the Buildings are adorn'd with Ornaments, repre&s;enting Tro|phies of Armes, and &s;uch like things, which make a very hand&s;om Show. At the end of the Court, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to the principal Entry, is the Por|tal of the Church, compo&s;ed of two ranks of Pillars, the fir&s;t or lowermo&s;t of the Compo|&s;ite order, and the &s;econd of the Corinthian. Here you may enter into that part of the Church which is appointed for tho&s;e of the Hou&s;e: as for tho&s;e who come from abroad they are building another part already &s;omewhat advan|ced, and this will be incomparably more mag|nificent. The Model in little may be &s;een in a Pavillion rai&s;ed on purpo&s;e; if it be performed according to this Model, nothing can be &s;een more glorious or of a greater de&s;ign. It will be a Dome very high rai&s;ed, under which the great Altar is to be placed, which will be enricht with all the mo&s;t beautiful Ornaments, which the mo&s;t &s;tudied Architecture can produce. The Cove|ring is to be gilt like that at <HI>Val de Grace,</HI> but they intend this to be more regular, and better perform'd, both for the di&s;po&s;ition and the Or|naments. You ought to &s;ee the Infirmaries, which are divided from the re&s;t of the Hou&s;e, but not far off. The Beds are neat, and the Sick receive there all the help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance that is nece&s;&s;ary, they are &s;erved by the <HI>Si&s;ters of the Charity of St. Lazar</HI>'s, who make it their parti|cular profe&s;&s;ion to wait upon the Sick in all parts of the Town, as well as in this Hou&s;e. But that which Strangers ought to ob&s;erve more e&s;peci|ally, are the four great Refectories which are on each &s;ide of the middle Court, where you will

&s;ee painted in <HI>Fre&s;quo,</HI> the principal Sieges and Battels which <HI>France</HI> has gain'd again&s;t her Ene|mies. Few Pictures are more exactly de&s;ign'd, or can &s;hew more variety and life than the&s;e; the &s;ight of which things cannot choo&s;e but give a very great plea&s;ure, to tho&s;e who were con|cern'd in the Actions repre&s;ented. There is in this Hou&s;e a certain Souldier works in Tapi&s;try, whom you ought not to forget to vi&s;it. As you go out you may ob&s;erve the Front of the build|ing, with the great Court before it, compa&s;t about with a dry Ditch, and a Wall of Free&s;tone, from which you have a delicate Pro&s;pect. They keep Guard at the Gates here in the &s;ame man|ner as in a Citadel, thereby to pre&s;erve the Souldiers in Health, and free from Idlene&s;s. The Di&s;cipline which they ob&s;erve in this Hou&s;e is admirably exact; and the Fathers of the Mi&s;|&s;ion, who have the Care and Conduct of the place, acquit them&s;elves very worthily.</P>
<P>All that remains of Note in this Quarter, after you have &s;een the <HI>Invalids</HI> is</P>

<P>Near this, in the <HI>R&uuml;e du Bac,</HI> is the <HI>Seminary of the Foreign-Mi&s;&s;ions,</HI> where of late they have built a Church, the Roof whereof is very &s;ur|prizing, it is indeed but low, becau&s;e they de&s;ign to rai&s;e a &s;econd Church upon this. It is the Invention of the Sieur <HI>du Bui&s;&s;on,</HI> an able Ar|chitect. From this Hou&s;e are &s;ent Mi&s;&s;ionaries into the <HI>Indies</HI> to Preach the Go&s;pel there to Infi|dels,

<P>But Books are not the only things that have made M. <HI>Blondel</HI> famous, the great Exploits which he hath perform'd in the Wars as well by Sea as Land: The Negotiations in which he has been employed with Foreign Princes; and in fine, the long Voyages which he has performed in the four parts of the World, wherein he has &s;een all that is ob&s;ervable, and thereby attained &s;o perfect a Knowledge in all things, that the reputation of his Experience and Abilities hath ju&s;tly acquired him the quality of a Coun&s;ellor of State.</P>

<P>But that which is infinitely more curious than all the re&s;t, is the great number of Agates, a|mong which there are 40 greater than the re&s;t, mo&s;t of them are antique, and repre&s;ent Deities, Emperors Heads, and Sacrifices, and are admi|rably well cut: Tho&s;e which are modern are graved by <HI>Coldor&eacute;,</HI> a famous Lapidary, and by &s;everal others as great Arti&s;ts; with the&s;e a &s;mall Chain of &s;ix great grains of Agate al&s;o.</P>
<P>Still the&s;e are not the mo&s;t precious things of this Cabinet, there are &s;ome things of greater e&s;teem, as 12 Bracelets compo&s;ed of Agates, Cornelians, Onyx, Ja&s;per, and of prime Eme|ralds adorn'd with Gold, which altogether make 150. antique Gravings, repre&s;enting <HI>Roman</HI> Dei|ties, and all the Emperors from <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> to <HI>Labienus Po&s;thumus,</HI> with 36.

This Suit is lookt upon as one of the mo&s;t &s;ingular Rarities that is at pre&s;ent, and it is without di&s;|pute the only thing of this kind in the whole World. For we never yet knew of any Man who collected a Suit of antique graved Stones as has been u&s;ually done of Medals; and this here hath been the Work of four of the mo&s;t famous <HI>Vertuo&s;i</HI> that ever were in <HI>France,</HI> who have above 50 Years u&s;ed their endeavours to

<P>All that you &s;ee in this Cabinet is of unu&s;ual Beauty, the Collection having been made by one who was perfectly knowing in the&s;e matters, and who &s;pared no Co&s;ts to attain the thing which plea&s;ed him.

<P>OF all the Monuments of Piety which St. <HI>Lew|is</HI> rai&s;ed, there is none more beautiful or more magnificent than this. Who making his u&s;u|al aboad in this Palace, cau&s;ed this Chapel to be erected for the conveniency of his own Devotion. In the &s;ame place where it now &s;tands there was formerly a &s;mall Church Founded by King <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> under the title of <HI>The Adoration of three Kings,</HI> in which Church <HI>Robert</HI> his Son did in&s;ti|tute an Order of Knights, called <HI>Knights of the Star.</HI> This Order was of great Reputation in the beginning of its In&s;titution, and the greate&s;t Lords accepted of the Collar. But in proce&s;s of time it became &s;o vilified, that it came to be confer'd on the Town Watch, who go about in the Night time to prevent di&s;orders, that might happen in the Streets from Thieves and Robbers. From whence it comes, that at this day, the Captain who commands that Watch is called the <HI>Chevalier du Guet</HI> (the Knight of the Watch). This little Chapel remain'd in &s;uch E&s;tate till the time of St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> who built the

Structure which we now &s;ee, a building of &s;ur|pri&s;ing Delicacy.

This beautiful Work was but five years in doingand was fini&s;ht in the year 1247. In a lit|tle time after which, they brought hither the Re|liques which are kept here. The&s;e were redeem'd by that holy King out of the hands of the <HI>Veneti|ans,</HI> to whom <HI>Baldwin</HI> Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> had engaged them for a very con&s;iderable Summ of Money, which they lent him to carry on his War again&s;t the <HI>Bulgarians.</HI> This Redemption of the&s;e precious Pawns by St. <HI>Lewis,</HI> was not done without the Emperors knowledge and con&s;ent to take them, upon paying to the <HI>Venetians</HI> the Moneys for which they were engaged. They were as follows, A great piece of Wood, part of the true Cro&s;s; our Lord's Crown of Thorns, and certain drops of his precious Blood; &s;ome of the Cloths which belonged to his Infancy; another piece of the true Cro&s;s, &s;ome Blood which bled Miraculou&s;ly from an Image of our Lord &s;truck by an Infidel; one link of Iron, part of the Chain wherewith he was bound; the Napkin or Towel with which he wa&s;hed his A|po&s;tles Feet; a piece of the Stone of his Sepul|cher; &s;ome of the Holy Virgins Milk; the Iron head of the Lance that pierced our Lord's &s;ide; the Purple Robe with which they Clothed him; the Spunge which they u&s;ed in giving him Vinegar and Gall to Drink; a piece of the

<P>THis is the next Bridge to the <HI>Pont-Neuf.</HI> It has this name becau&s;e formerly there were a great many Money-Changers, or Banckers, who inhabited the Hou&s;es on this Bridge, and made a kind of Exchange or <HI>Bource</HI> in this place. It has been al&s;o formerly called the <HI>Pont aux Oi&s;eaux,</HI> or Bridge of Birds, becau&s;e no doubt of Bird&s;ellers here dwelling. But be|ing in the Year 1629, burnt down by an ex|traordinary Fire, it being then of Wood, it was afterwards rebuilt of Free&s;tone, as we now &s;ee it, with &s;o much &s;olidity, that they have erected upon it two Rows of double Hou&s;es
<PB N="184" REF="182">
four Stories high, all of them arched with Free|&s;tone. The&s;e Hou&s;es are inhabited by Traders, who have their Warehou&s;es on the &s;ide next the Water, and their Shops in the forepart. This Bridge has the mo&s;t Pa&s;&s;engers of all in <HI>Paris,</HI> becau&s;e of the <HI>Palais</HI> which &s;tands at the end of it.</P>
<P>At one end, over a hou&s;e which fronts the Bridge, you may &s;ee the King's Statue about the Age of 10. years old, Crown'd with Laurel by the Figure of a Victory. This Statue is rai&s;ed on a little Pede&s;tal; and on each &s;ide of it are the Statues of <HI>Lewis</HI> the 13<HI>th.</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> as big as the Life, in Bra&s;s. The&s;e Statues are very well de&s;ign'd, and very like.</P>
<P>The Key or Wharf, called <HI>Qua de Ge&s;vers,</HI> leads from this Bridge, to the Bridge of <HI>No&s;tre-Dame,</HI> under cover all the way. It is &s;upported by Vaults, who&s;e Foundation is in the River, of a &s;ort of Work extraordinary hardy, tho&s;e who affect &s;uch things ought to go down and ob&s;erve it.</P>

<P>Within the limits of the <HI>H&ocirc;tel Dieu,</HI> are two other Bridges built: One of which is wholly belonging to that Ho&s;pital, the other is partly u&s;ed for a conveniency of pa&s;&s;age on foot to the Church of <HI>N&ocirc;tre-Dame,</HI> every one that goes o|ver that way paying a <HI>Double</HI> for pa&s;&s;age.

They began the Work with much eagerne&s;s at that end next the <HI>Great Augu&s;tins;</HI> but the Troubles of that King's Reign prevented this great Enterpri&s;e from being fini&s;h'd in his time. It remained imperfect from its fir&s;t undertaking in the Year 1578, as I have &s;aid, till the Year 1604, when <HI>Henry the Great,</HI> of happy memo|ry, compleated the Work, by the means of <HI>Wil|liam Marchand.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that this Bridge is one of the mo&s;t beautiful that can be &s;een for its length, which extends over the two arms of the <HI>Seine,</HI> which unite here into one Channel; for its breadth, which is divided into three ways, one in the mid&s;t for Coaches and great Carriages, and two on each &s;ide rai&s;ed higher for tho&s;e who go on foot; and la&s;tly for its &s;tructure, which is of &s;uch &s;olidity and of &s;uch an ordinance, that has but few equals.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e advantages one may al&s;o add the delicate Pro&s;pect which the Pa&s;&s;enger has from it: A view which pa&s;&s;es for one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and fine&s;t of the World; and if we may believe tho&s;e who have &s;een foreign parts, and the report of one of the greate&s;t Travellers in this age, he tells us, That he never ob&s;erved any Pro&s;pect more magnificent, naming this for the third of tho&s;e which he hath ob&s;erved, to wit, That of the Port at <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> that of the Port at <HI>Goa</HI> in the <HI>Indies;</HI> and this of the <HI>Pont-Neuf</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> which extends on one &s;ide over the <HI>Louvre</HI> which runs along the <HI>Seine,</HI> with a long row of magnificent buildings; and on the other &s;ide the <HI>H&ocirc;tel de Conti,</HI> the Colledge of the <HI>Quatre-Nations,</HI> which is very remarkable for its Dome, and for the two great &s;quare
