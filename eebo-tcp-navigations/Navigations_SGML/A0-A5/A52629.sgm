<P>With which Rites if this Nation of the Iri&s;h had not bin corrupted almo&s;t to our days, both the right of lineall &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion among them had been more certain, and as well the Gentry as the vulgar had not embrued them&s;elves &s;o wic|kedly with the effu&s;ion of &s;o much bloud of their own kin|red about their inheritance and legitimation, nor had they become &s;o infamous in the&s;e re&s;pects among other for|reigne Nations.</P>
<P>And further concerning their natures and di&s;po&s;ition, you may take the relation from the Earle of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> his Let|ter to Q&punc; <HI>Eli&s;abet</HI> gathered by his experience.</P>
<P>The people in generall have able bodies by nature, and have gotten by cu&s;tome ready u&s;e of armes, and by their late &s;ucce&s;&s;e, boldne&s;&s;e to fight with your Maje&s;tis forces.</P>
<P>In their pride they value no man but them&s;elves, in their affections, they love nothing but idlene&s;&s;e and licentiou&s;|nes, in their Rebellion, they have no other end but to &s;hake off the yoke of obedience, to root out all remembrance of the Engli&s;h Nation in that Kingdome. This is the generall quarrell of the Iri&s;h, and they who doe not profe&s;&s;e it, are either &s;o few, or &s;o fal&s;e, that there is no account to be made of them.</P>
<P>The Iri&s;h Nobility and Lords of Countries do not only in their hearts affect this quarrell, and are divided from us in Religion, but have an e&s;peciall grudge again&s;t the Eng|li&s;h Government, becau&s;e it limiteth and tyeth them, who have and &s;till would be &s;upream Lords, if not Tyrants. The Towns being inhabited by men of the &s;ame Religion and
<PB N="27" REF="20">
birth with the re&s;t, are &s;o carried away with the love of gaine, and for that cau&s;e &s;upply the Rebels with what they want: therefore they mu&s;t be &s;trictly looked unto.</P>
<P>The Laws of the Iri&s;h was that of fi&s;h and birds, the great devoure the le&s;&s;e, the &s;trong the weak, having but one Free-holder in a County, and he Lord both of e&s;tate and lives of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>For their &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to inheritances, it was by the law or cu&s;tome called <HI>Tani&s;try,</HI> mentioned by that excellent Hi|&s;torian Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh:</HI> which is this, that a man is pre|ferred to a boy: the Uncle before the Nephew, and com|monly the mo&s;t active, not the next heire is cho&s;en, to hin|der the inroad and oppre&s;&s;ion of the next adjoyning Lord, between whom there was alwayes contention, which did &s;o wa&s;t and con&s;ume them, or el&s;e being idle, the Land would not have &s;u&s;tained them.</P>
<P>Concerning the apparell of the Iri&s;h it is after a &s;lovenly manner, and the very Engli&s;h, there are much infected with this na&s;ty filthine&s;&s;e, e&s;pecially lowzie beds, and foule lin|nen, except where the chiefe Engli&s;h live, as in Dublin, Wa|teford, and Kin&s;ale, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure retaine the Engli&s;h neatne&s;&s;e; but for the meere wilde Iri&s;h it may be &s;aid of them as of the Germans, that they wander &s;lovenly and naked, and lodge in the &s;ame room with their cattle.</P>
<P>Among them the better &s;ort u&s;ed to weare clo&s;e bree|ches and &s;tockings of the &s;ame, of red or &s;ome light co|lour, &s;o &s;traight that the un&s;eemly parts of the body were expo&s;ed unto view.</P>
<P>They u&s;ed likewi&s;e a loo&s;e Coat and a three covered Mantle of coar&s;e cloth, with a cap of Thrums.</P>

very nimble in taking Lice in a Sunny day, or a green bank.</P>
<P>But in the more Northern parts before the &s;trict civili|zing of them in King <HI>James</HI> his time, both men and women went naked in the very Winter, having only their &s;ecret parts covered with a rag and a loo&s;e Mantle ca&s;t over them.</P>
<P>Thus naked they walke with their &s;word tyed unto them with a wyth in&s;tead of a belt.</P>
<P>And at night men and women lye in a Ring together, round about the fire, in the middle of the roome with their feet towards it, folding their head and upper parts in their woollen Mantle fir&s;t &s;teeped in water to keep them warm, for they &s;ay, woollen wetted, and warmed by the heat of their bodies, doth pre&s;erve heat.</P>
<P>The Church Di&s;cipline hath beene formerly and now is after the &s;ame manner with that in England, by Arch|bi&s;hops, whereof there are foure, Bi&s;hops 29, many more formerly.</P>
<P>It has beene anciently a great Nur&s;ery of Religion and Pietie: even from (if not before) Saint <HI>Patricks</HI> time, and Saint <HI>Bridget</HI> his Di&s;ciple, who did advance Religion and Piety much in that Kingdome, as al&s;o in &s;undry other pla|ces of Chri&s;tendome.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hops were formerly con&s;ecrated by the Arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury, untill the yeere 1142: at what time Pope <HI>Eugenius</HI> the fourth, &s;ent Cardinall <HI>Paperio,</HI> who to|gether with <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Bi&s;hop of Li&s;more, Legat of all Ire|land, held a Councell at Mell, and with the con&s;ent of the Bi&s;hops, Abbots, Kings, and Dukes of Ireland, e&s;tabli&s;hed foure Archbi&s;hops, <HI>videlicet</HI> Armagh, Dublin, Ca&s;&s;ile, and Toam. But the e&s;tate of the Clergy has been very meane there, &s;o that by rea&s;on of devouring impropriations in the whole County of Connought.

<P>Thus did hee receive the homage of divers Iri&s;h petty Kings, willing to obtain them by gentle means.</P>
<P>And keeping his Chri&s;tma&s;&s;e there in great &s;tate, and &s;et|ling the Government of the Church, hee is unexpectedly called into England, leaving <HI>Hugh Lacy</HI> at Dublin.</P>

<P>In the yeere 1339, there was a generall warre betweene the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h, wherein many of the Iri&s;h peri&s;hed, after which time matters were quiet untill the eighteenth yeere of <HI>Richard</HI> the Second, being 1400.</P>

<P>But in the time of the wars between York and Lanca&s;ter, wherein many Noble Families were quite extingui&s;hed in England, many Engli&s;h came out of Ireland either to take part of po&s;&s;e&s;sion of &s;ome inheritances, which fell unto them by the death of their friends.</P>

<P>He put up a Petition to the Parliament in <HI>Ireland,</HI> that he might enjoy the inheritance of his Grandfather <HI>Con,</HI> and his father, granted to be Earles of <HI>Tirone,</HI> which by the help of Sir <HI>John Perrot,</HI> Lord Deputy, was procured of the Queen.</P>

<P>After who&s;e death he u&s;urped the title of <HI>O Neale,</HI> which was capitall, yet coloured it over with a pretence, that it was only to hinder others.</P>

<P>And going into <HI>England,</HI> he was there detained pri&s;oner,

for that he came without the licence of the Lord Deputie, Sir <HI>William Fitz Williams:</HI> but on &s;ubmi&s;sion, and certaine Articles propo&s;ed to him by the Lords, and he willingly accepting promi&s;ing to confirme them before the Lord De|puty in <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>In the yeere 1590, it hapned that <HI>Con</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Shan O Neale,</HI> accu&s;ed <HI>Hugh</HI> of trea&s;onable practices before the Lords in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>All which <HI>Hugh</HI> vehemently denied; but after getting his accu&s;er in his power, he hanged him.</P>
<P>In <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the &s;ame yeere <HI>Hugh</HI> Earle of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> (for &s;o hereafter we mu&s;t call him, did promi&s;e under his hand be|fore the Lord Deputy: and coun&s;ell of <HI>Ireland</HI> to performe tho&s;e Articles agreed upon in <HI>England,</HI> but u&s;ed many ex|cu&s;es to put off the execution of them.</P>
<P>And about this time <HI>Hugh Ror Mac Mahone</HI> was put to death by the Lord Deputy <HI>Williams</HI> very unju&s;tly (as &s;ome &s;ay) to the great &s;candall of the Lord Deputy; and it cau|&s;ed great complaints and out-cryes among the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who pre&s;ently preferred their grievances again&s;t that Deputy&punc; and he driven to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>And upon this fact the government of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the North became odious, and they did &s;trive what they could to &s;hake it oft, by expelling the Sheriffs from among them, fearing the like u&s;age as <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">c Mahone.</HI> And 1593, <HI>Mao Guir</HI> chiefe of <HI>Fermanagh</HI> &s;tood upon his guard, accu&s;ing the De|puty of inju&s;tice in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e off <HI>Mahone,</HI> and &s;et upon Captain <HI>Willis,</HI> and drove him and his guard being Sheriffe into a Church, and would have put them all to the &s;word, had not <HI>Tyrone,</HI> interceded for them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Deputy got into his hands <HI>Eniskillen Mac Guirs</HI> ca&s;tle, and proclaimed him a Traytor&punc; and like|wi&s;e gave out &s;ome hard &s;peeches concerning <HI>Tyrone,</HI> which
<PB N="39" REF="26">
did much exa&s;perate him, and cau&s;ed him to combine with the Lords of the North, to defend their Honours, Laws, and Liberties: and u&s;ed two notable plots to a&s;si&s;t him to|wards this Rebellion.</P>
<P>1 To make his men skilfull, hee profered to &s;erve the Queen with 500 men of his own.</P>
<P>And for that end procured expert Captains to exerci&s;e them; and &s;o often changing the&s;e his men, got mo&s;t of his followers to be able Souldiers.</P>
<P>Secondly, hee pretended to build a faire hou&s;e at <HI>Dun|gannon,</HI> and &s;o got much lead to make Battlements, which after he ca&s;t into bullets.</P>
<P>In the meane time Sir <HI>Henry Bagnal</HI> Mar&s;hall of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who&s;e Si&s;ter <HI>Tyrone</HI> had married, did preferre many Arti|cles again&s;t him, unto which hee an&s;wered &s;o cunningly, &s;aying, that the Mar&s;hall did it out of &s;pleen of purpo&s;e to detain his &s;i&s;ters portion, and &s;eemingly quitted him&s;elfe; but afterward he grew jealous of his owne &s;afety.</P>
<P>At this time <HI>Gauranus</HI> a Prie&s;t whom the Pope had made Primate of all <HI>Ireland,</HI> &s;educed certaine Iri&s;h Lords, among which <HI>Mac Guir</HI> was chief, and was overthrowne by Sir <HI>Richard Bingham,</HI> and the Prie&s;t &s;laine: in which &s;ervice <HI>Ty|rone</HI> was again&s;t <HI>Mac Guir</HI> with the Queens forces&punc; but &s;e|cretly prepared for his Rebellion.</P>
<P>Then the &s;onnes of <HI>Shan O Neale,</HI> were pri&s;oners in <HI>Du|blin</HI> Ca&s;tle, which had they been kept, had been a bridle in <HI>Tyrones</HI> mouth; but by connivance of Sir <HI>William Fitz Wil|liams</HI> the Deputy, were &s;uffered to e&s;cape, and &s;o <HI>Tyrone</HI> got them into his cu&s;tody, nor would he relea&s;e them although thereunto required.</P>
<P>But covering his Rebellion, with feeming feares of his conceived enemies, made daily complaints of the Mar|&s;hals envy; and what wrong he had done him.</P>
<P>In the yeere 1594, the Rebellion bur&s;t out; Sir <HI>William

<P>Yet he appeared in per&s;on at <HI>Dublin,</HI> before the new Lord Deputy, de&s;iring her Maje&s;ties favour, out of which hee had falne, rather by the calumny of them, then any cau&s;e of his own.</P>
<P>But the Mar&s;hall charged him with great matters, ready to prove them; &s;o that the Deputy thought fit to &s;tay him, but the Councell of <HI>Ireland</HI> were of the contrary opinion, &s;o he was let goe, but the Queene was much di&s;plea&s;ed for it, and &s;harply reproved the Deputy, but he laid the fault on the Councell of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>And pre&s;ently tooke the field with his Army to relieve <HI>Eniskillen</HI> in <HI>Ferminaght,</HI> and in the Winter following, there was little done becau&s;e there was &s;ome Treaties of peace, but the Rebels grew &s;o peremptory in their demands, that it was not liked by the Lords in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore &s;ent over two thou&s;and old &s;ouldiers that had &s;erved in <HI>Britany,</HI> and a thou&s;and more taken up in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which news <HI>Tyrone</HI> hearing, and that the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Bali&s;hannan,</HI> and <HI>Relike,</HI> were to be planted with Engli&s;h Ga|ri&s;ons.

<P>This Lord Deputy fearing this &s;torme might fall upon him, de&s;ired the Coun&s;el of <HI>England</HI> to &s;end him an a&s;&s;i&s;tant of &s;ome experienced Souldiers; which hee meant &s;hould be under his command; but the Lords mi&s;taking his mean|ing, &s;ent over Sir <HI>John Norris,</HI> a great Commander and well experienced, that would &s;carce give way to any; who was &s;tyled Lord Generall, and to command in chief, in the ab|&s;ence of the Lord Deputy.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="27">But the emulation that grew between the&s;e two hinde|red the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e; yet both of them went into the field, with the Army towards <HI>Armagh.</HI></P>

<P>But upon <HI>Tyrones</HI> in&s;tance, Commi&s;sioners were appoin|ted by the Queen to treat with the Rebels.</P>
<P>At which time <HI>Tyrone</HI> complained of the Mar&s;hall of ma|ny injuries.</P>
<P>And his demands were, that hee might have his Wives portion of the Mar&s;hall, and the free exerci&s;e of his Reli|gion, and many other.</P>
<P>But when Articles were propounded on the Queenes part, they &s;et &s;o light of them, and made &s;uch &s;corne, that the Conference brake off: though the Queen for &s;paring of bloud, had re&s;olved to give them any rea&s;onable Condi|tions.</P>
<P>This parley ended, the Lord Deputy, and the Lord Ge|nerall comming to <HI>Armagh,</HI> did &s;o much terrifie the Rebels that <HI>Tyrone</HI> left the Fort of <HI>Blackwater,</HI> burnt the Town of <HI>Dungannon,</HI> and pull'd down his hou&s;e there, and betooke him&s;elfe to the Woods.</P>

<P>Now the <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> Rebels being revolted grew &s;trong, and forraged even to the gates of <HI>Dublin,</HI> to the County of <HI>Wexford.</HI></P>

<P>At this Dep&punc; arriving Generall <HI>Norris</HI> was commanded to his charge, which was Lord Pre&s;ident of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> and not to &s;tirre thence without leave, which thing did pre&s;ent|ly

<P>Where the Rebell with all his force a&s;&s;ayled him, and bearing a deadly hatred and malice again&s;t the Mar&s;hall, again&s;t whom he bent his whole &s;trength, and commanded his Souldiers &s;o to doe, that he had the fortune to kill him; yet like a valiant Gentleman he &s;old his life at a deare rate, to many of the Rebels. But his fall cau&s;ed our mens hearts to fayle; whereupon the Rebell had the greate&s;t advantage again&s;t the Engli&s;h: the like never hapning againe, called The Defeat at <HI>Blackwater.</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="29">
wherein we lo&s;t thirteen valiant Captains, and fifteen hun|dred old Souldiers: whereupon likewi&s;e the &s;urrender of the Fort en&s;ued.</P>
<P>It was thought this misfortune to happen from an over|&s;ight of the Mar&s;hall, who made the Van of the army too &s;uddenly to retreat; and too &s;udden faces about, puts feare in the Reare; and makes them &s;uppo&s;e it may be a running away.</P>
<P>For as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in his fifth book &amp; fir&s;t part of the Hi&s;tory of the World, that as well in the Wars of the&s;e la|ter ages as in former times it hath been found ever extreame dangerous to make a Retreat in the head of an enemies army: as he renders the rea&s;on, but I cannot digre&s;&s;e any further.</P>
<P>This overthrow much increa&s;ed the in&s;olencie of the Re|bels, the Rebells having gotten courage and armes thereby, and <HI>Tyrone</HI> termed the Deliverer of his Countrey, and the authour of their liberty.</P>
<P>All <HI>Vl&s;ter</HI> in Rebellion, <HI>Connagh</HI> revolted, and the Rebels in <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> a continuall terrour and vexation to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Tyrone</HI> &s;ent forces into <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> where after the departure of Sir <HI>John Norris,</HI> mo&s;t of the County revolted, and now brake out like Lightning, making havock, and de|&s;troying in a barbarous manner. And for the better counte|nancing of the matter, a new pretended Earle of <HI>De&s;mond</HI> is &s;et up, on condition to be Va&s;&s;all to <HI>O Neale.</HI></P>
<P>At this time a &s;upply came out of <HI>England,</HI> of a thou&s;and and fifty old Souldiers from out the Low Countreys, and nine hundred and fifty joyned to them of new, rai&s;ed in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> &s;ent under the command of Sir <HI>Samuel Bagnal</HI> Colonel, and nine other Captains to &s;trengthen the Queenes forces i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Lem&s;ter,</HI> and a hundred under Colonel <HI>Bagnals</HI> command.</P>

a&s;hamed to intreat for pardon, and &s;ue for peace.</P>
<P>Although, as appeared in his Letters &s;ent to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> he magnified his victories, and vowed per&s;everance: but his conditions were in&s;olent and &s;o not regarded.</P>
<P>And now the wound is growne &s;o great, and the ca&s;e &s;o de&s;perate that it admits of no cure, but by the hand of a va|liant expert &s;ouldier.</P>
<P>And none found like <HI>Robert</HI> Earle of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> whom favour with the Queen, and fortune of warre had made popular.</P>
<P>And his own active inclination, and the policie of his powerfull enemies in Court, wrought it for his underta|king; and by his ab&s;ence they plotted his en&s;uing over|throw.</P>
<P>But before his going two Regiments of old Souldiers out of the Low Countries were &s;ent into <HI>Ireland,</HI> and di&s;per&s;ed at his comming through the whole army, for the exerci&s;e of the re&s;t.</P>

<P>The Queen hearing this and more, that the Rebels daily increa&s;ed, and the Engli&s;h Iri&s;h di&s;contented that the go|vernment was wholly out of their hands, by &s;ending Eng|li&s;h Deputies over.</P>
<P>That <HI>Tyrone</HI> grew proud, bearing tru&s;t on the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> who had &s;ent him &s;omewhat, but promi&s;ed more; and the Pope not wanting in his fatherly cate towards him, &s;ent him a crowne of Phenix feathers, in imitation no doubt of <HI>Vrban</HI> the third, who &s;ent King <HI>John</HI> Lord of <HI>Ire|land</HI> a crowne of Peacocks feathers.</P>
<P>Upon this Sir <HI>Charles Blunt,</HI> Lord <HI>Montjoy,</HI> is thought fit to be &s;ent, and was thought on by the Qu. before <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> came over, who was forward to take the charge upon him, and &s;o turned the Queenes intentions&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="38">This Lord was a tall comely man, wi&s;e, valiant, and lear|ned, clo&s;e in his coun&s;els, re&s;olute in his determinations.</P>
<P>His cour&s;es were much contrary to other Deputies, and &s;o effected what they could not doe.</P>
<P>1. He led our men warily on any &s;ervice, not willing to di&s;-hearten our men, or incourage the enemie; and him&s;elfe ever at hand, either to hearten or helpe, hee ventured his own per&s;on often, although it be a great que&s;tion in Mili|tary di&s;cipline, whether it be wi&s;edome or no.</P>

<P>Other Deputies made two or three journeys in the yeare, and that with the whole Army; which was di&s;covered by the Rebels, that they fled into the woods and bogges, nor could the Army abide the field long for want of victuals, being &s;o many at one place; where as the Lord <HI>Montjoy</HI> planting good Garri&s;ons in many places, taking the field with 1000&punc; foot, and 200. hor&s;e onely, was able openly to affront <HI>Tyrone,</HI> &s;eeing he was compelled to leave many of his forces behind to guard his Countrey from tho&s;e Gar|ri&s;ons, which el&s;e would have forraged his Countrey.</P>
<P>Thus he did not only in Summer as others had done, but in Winter al&s;o, him&s;elfe being five or &s;ixe dayes in a weeke, on hor&s;e-backe, which cour&s;e did &s;o vexe the Rebels, who were driven to lye in the woods without &s;helter for them|&s;elves or cowes, which allowing them not milk, they wan|ted pre&s;ent provi&s;ion, nor could they &s;ave their corne for the future.</P>
<P>4. Againe, he had a &s;peciall care to cut the pa&s;&s;ages open and plaine, that our forces might the more &s;ecure meet to|gether.</P>
<P>5. Further, he was not ea&s;ie to grant Pardons and Pro|tections,

but to &s;uch who had drawne blood on their fel|lowes, and &s;o lo&s;t the hope of reconciliation to the Rebels, and forbad all parlyes with them.</P>
<P>But as the Rebels were many at the Earle of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> com|ming, &s;o now much more increa&s;ed. In the County of <HI>Du|blin</HI> increa&s;ed one hundred.</P>
<P>And in many other Countreys, be&s;ides five Ca&s;tles late|ly taken by the Iri&s;h.</P>

<P>Who had one hundred Iri&s;h men in the Queenes pay.</P>
<P>So that now the Enemie &s;tronge&s;t, the Engli&s;h weake&s;t, and many other di&s;a&s;ters made the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e very difficult.</P>

<P>A little before who&s;e comming <HI>Tyrone</HI> marcheth out of the North in a vaunting manner unto <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> to incou|rage and countenance the Rebels, but under a religious pretence to vi&s;ite a peece of the Cro&s;&s;e at a Mona&s;tery in <HI>Tipperary</HI> County, and &s;o accompanied with the <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> re|bels went on his devotion.</P>

<P>The Counte&s;&s;e of <HI>Ormond</HI> having one only daughter, was much perplexed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, but the Lord Deputy &s;ent her a Guard for her Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There were &s;everall conceits upon his &s;urpri&s;all, &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ing it was not again&s;t his owne will, but how&s;oever the Lord Deputy thought it a matter of no great con&s;e|quence.</P>
<P>The Fort of <HI>Phillip&s;town</HI> in <HI>Ophaly</HI> was to be victualled,

His Lord&s;hip drew towards <HI>Armagh</HI> with 1500 hundred foot and two hundred hor&s;e, and &s;ent Captain <HI>Edward Blany</HI> with five hundred foot, and fifty hor&s;e to make good the pa&s;&s;age through the <HI>Moyry</HI> for the Earle of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert,</HI> who were to come that way to the Army: and comming to the <HI>Faghard,</HI> not far from <HI>Dundalke,</HI> whether hee went to the Earle, and told him of the convoy, a&s;&s;uring him that the Lord Deputy would meet him by two of the clocke in the afternoon; hereupon the Earle having with him be&s;ides the conuoy, two foot companyes, and fifty hor&s;e of Gentle|men Volunteers: and &s;o marched backe to the dangerous pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Moyry;</HI> where the Rebels taking advantage of the Woods and Bogs, a&s;&s;ailed our men, lying lurking on both &s;ides, our men being to pa&s;&s;e over a Ford.</P>

and the re&s;t fell back into the Wood, and i&s;&s;ued out upon the Reare, brought up by the Earle of <HI>Southamp|ton,</HI> with great fury both with hor&s;e and foot: But Sir <HI>Henry Foliot</HI> made very good &s;tand, and Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert</HI> taking his colours in his own hand, with &s;ome thirty of the Earle of <HI>Southamptons</HI> be&s;t men, ha&s;tened towards the a&s;&s;aylants to &s;econd the Earle, who behaved him&s;elfe with great cou|rage, and made the Rebels give ground.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrone</HI> was &s;eene not farre off with great forces, yet fell not on, &s;o that they marched to the Camp: little hurt be|ing done to the Engli&s;h, but much to the Rebels.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the 26, the Deputy had Letters from the Lords in <HI>England,</HI> and it was only to an&s;wer the demands of &s;ome Iri&s;h Lords upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the 19, the Lord Deputy &s;ent to Ma&s;ter Secretary how that certain aide was come from <HI>Spaine</HI> to the Rebels; and makes a reque&s;t for a fleet to lie on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and &s;ome &s;mall Barks to hinder the <HI>Scots</HI> from relieving the Iri&s;h, Now Sir <HI>Samuel Bagnal</HI> drew out of the <HI>Newry</HI> into <HI>Monaghan,</HI> where he took &s;ome booty, and &s;lue &s;ix Com|manders, and many of the Rebels men with little damage to him&s;elfe.</P>

<P>Two chiefe Rebels offer to &s;ubmit, but neither could be received without the others head.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip now out of <HI>England</HI> required to doe &s;ome thing again&s;t the <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> rebels; in his way thither, tooke two hundred Cowes, &s;even hundred Garrais, and five hun|dred &s;heep, burning and wa&s;ting the corne all the way, as he went to a mo&s;t dangerous pa&s;&s;age, where Sir <HI>Oliver Lam|bert</HI> was appointed to meet him, both being con&s;trained to

fight all the way with the rebels untill they met, having done much harme unto the rebels.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> the &s;eventeenth, they both marched towards a For|tre&s;&s;e, where the Rebels had &s;tored much provi&s;ion of all &s;orts, at who&s;e entry there was a Foard compa&s;&s;ed with Bogs, over which our hor&s;es pa&s;&s;ed quietly: but his Lord|ding in the head of the foot was a&s;&s;ayled with fury.</P>
<P>The Traitour <HI>Terrill</HI> having appointed a hundred &s;hot to ply the Deputies per&s;on, and given them marks to know him.</P>
<P>But the Engli&s;h defeated and &s;lue 35 rebels, among which was <HI>Owmy Mac Rory,</HI> a vile rebell, who before had taken the Earle of <HI>Ormond</HI> pri&s;oner, a bloudy bold young man; by who&s;e death that party never was able to appear in field.</P>
<P>And now the Captaine, and by their example the &s;oul|diers cut down the corn with their &s;words, that the rebels were driven to want for the future.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip returned one day with the foot alone, and &s;ent about the Hor&s;e, and yet the rebels which lay there about dur&s;t not fight with him.</P>
<P>Eight heads of chief rebels were brought unto his Lord|&s;hip that night, and one arch-rebell alive, who was pre&s;ent|ly hanged.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Oliver Lambert</HI> foraging abroad, tooke a thou&s;and Cowes, five hundred Garrais, and a multitude of &s;heep and killed twenty rebels; and much &s;poile daily was done then by the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>At his Lord&s;hips going out of <HI>Leaz,</HI> &s;ome were received protection.</P>
<P>At this time his Lord&s;hip had letters of approbation from her Maje&s;ty, with a promi&s;e of &s;upply both of hor&s;e and foot, and with advice to make the company le&s;&s;e, there|by

to gratifie more Gentlemen with places of command.</P>
<P><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> the twentieth, his Lord&s;hip returned to <HI>Dublin&punc;</HI> where hee heard of the complaints that were made again&s;t him by tho&s;e of the Pale to the Lords in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In an&s;wer whereunto he writes to Ma&s;ter Secretary, onely de&s;iring his good wil in candid interpretation of his actions</P>
<P><HI>September</HI> the fourteenth, his Lord&s;hip takes his journey towards the North, and encampeth three miles beyond <HI>Dundalke,</HI> and lay there untill the eighth of <HI>October,</HI> it being mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous foule weather, his Lord&s;hips Tent ha|ving been often blown over.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrone,</HI> in the mean time, before his Lord&s;hip came, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the <HI>Newry,</HI> a &s;trong Fortre&s;&s;e as any the Rebels had, but his Lord&s;hip was re&s;olved to cut his way through them if they made re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Many skirmi&s;hes fell out well on our part, and in &s;mall time he came to <HI>Armagh,</HI> where not farre off his Lord&s;hip built a Fort in a very convenient place; having a River by it all environed with Bogs, &amp; a hill like a Promontory which his Lord&s;hip called Mount <HI>Norris.</HI></P>
<P>So hee &s;ent &s;ome companies of ours to fetch corne and timber over the Bogs, where <HI>Tyrone</HI> met with them; and skirmi&s;hing with them was put to the wor&s;t, and next day <HI>Neale O Quin,</HI> was taken pri&s;oner, <HI>Tyrones</HI> great Favourite.</P>
<P>And the rebels intending to hinder the building of the Fort were &s;oundly beaten, and that fini&s;hed and left in it foure hundred men under Captain <HI>Blany.</HI></P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip returning by <HI>Carlingford</HI> found the pa&s;&s;age very difficult for his hor&s;e, that they were &s;ent a little a|bout; and now they had certaine intelligence that <HI>Tyrone</HI> was come downe unto a place, by which we were to pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>Which was a very great Wood at the foot of a Moun|tain, reaching &s;o neer the Sea, that it had no more &s;pace, then
<PB N="71" REF="44">
that &s;ix or &s;even might walke abrea&s;t, with &s;ome le&s;&s;e, and at full Sea none in &s;ome places.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip di&s;po&s;ing his forces for the fight, &s;ending out a forlorne hope to march afore, and a forlorne Reare.</P>
<P>The enemy &s;ought to make good a &s;mall piece of ground like a &s;emicircle, where the Sea made a Diameter, and a thick Wood the Circumference; and at the corner next to our Army, there ran a River out off the Wood at the &s;ide of which they made &s;trong trenches, and at the further cor|ner a Barricado which reached far into the wood, and down to the Sea.</P>
<P>The enemy appeared hor&s;e and foot on this plain, but at our mens going over the River, their hor&s;e drew into the Woods, and their foot into the Trenches, whence they poured out Vollies of &s;hot.</P>
<P>But the &s;tout courage of the Engli&s;h was &s;uch that in little &s;pace they beat them out of their Trenches and from their works, and made them retire into the woods, but &s;allied out againe upon our Reare; to their further lo&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>And in all this not much hurt to us, only two Gentlemen of quality killed; not twenty lo&s;t, about &s;ixty hurt, of the enemy eighty killed, and the lo&s;&s;e was (as wee had intelli|gence two hundred.</P>
<P>Our Mar&s;hall and Serjeant Major were always ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the weak, and bring &s;uccour to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the Army went on cheerfully.</P>
<P>And by this <HI>Tyrones</HI> reputation got a crack.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip returned to <HI>Dundalke,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Dublin,</HI> with his followers and Voluntiers, having di&s;po&s;ed the hor&s;e and foot into Garri&s;ons, Forts&punc; and Provinces under their Commanders.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e were 1198. The foot 14150.</P>

<P>And <HI>E&s;sex</HI> irreparably fell, more perchance by the &s;harp|ne&s;&s;e of his enemies wit, then by the burthen of his owne crime.</P>
<P>How&s;oever the Deputy being privy to &s;o much as hee was, he &s;aid he would not put his necke under the Queenes Attourneys tongue; and re&s;olved with him&s;elfe that had he been &s;ent for into <HI>England,</HI> not to have undergone the ha|zard of a triall: but his Lord&s;hips former &s;ervice, and future employment blew over this &s;torm without any &s;hatter fal|ling on him.</P>
