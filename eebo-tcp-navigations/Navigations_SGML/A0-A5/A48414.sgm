<HEAD>THE Author's Preface.</HEAD>
<P>THE World is &s;o earne&s;t af|ter the Even<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Pre|&s;ent War, that it has hard|ly Lei&s;ure enough to read the &s;everal Accounts which are continually print|ed on that Subject: And this takes up all our Thoughts &s;o much, that we have &s;carce Time to reflect on pa&s;t Tran&s;actions. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, we have Rea&s;on enough for this; for what is pa&s;t cannot effect us much, becau&s;e it can neither add to our Mi&s;ery, nor better our Condition.</P>
<P>But, the War, wherein <HI>Europe</HI> is now engag'd, is of &s;o great a Con|&s;equence, that, according to the Turn of Affairs, every one mu&s;t have their Hopes or Fears, either to expect a Happy Change in their Fortunes, or to dread the contrary. Yet tho' we
<PB REF="3"> now &s;eem wholly taken up with the pre&s;ent, there are, however, &s;ome Hi&s;tories of former Times capable to excite the Curio&s;ity of the Publick, becau&s;e what is pa&s;t may enable us to argue on what's to come, and to draw Con&s;equences accordingly.</P>
<P>The following Hi&s;tory, of <HI>Van Tromp,</HI> is of this kind; and what the States have perform'd under the Conduct of that <HI>Great Man,</HI> and &s;ometimes, by them&s;elves, and again&s;t Two formidable Pow|ers; we may rea&s;onably conclude, that now, &s;ince the &s;aid States and <HI>England</HI> are united, nothing can be able to oppo&s;e them at Sea, provided they will be but unanimous and act in Con&s;ort:</P>
<P>The manner of the Deliverance of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in <HI>1672.</HI> from the Slavery wherewith they were threatned, next to the Favour and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, through the wi&s;e Conduct and Valour of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> now King of <HI>England,</HI> and
<PB REF="3"> by the Victories which the Admirals of this State have obtain'd over both the Fleets of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> then joyn'd together, gives us very good Rea&s;on, likewi&s;e, to conclude; that there is nothing we may not at this Day expect from the&s;e two Potent States, &s;ince they have both put them|&s;elves under the Conduct of that Prince, who commands their Armies conjunctly, and &s;ince their Naval Forces are united again&s;t the <HI>Com|mon Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>We are therefore per&s;uaded, that this Work will not now be un&s;ea&s;on|able, but will have the good Fortune to be well received by the variety of Events, of which we have hitherto had but a very imperfect Account; be|cau&s;e that few Hi&s;torians have made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to treat at large of Matters relating to the Sea. Here|in you will find exact Relations of many bloody Engagements perform'd in mo&s;t Seas, and which have been
<PB REF="4"> often follow'd by De&s;cents on the Territories of tho&s;e that have had the wor&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of it. Herein you will &s;ee, how Victory has been di&s;puted between the mo&s;t powerful, as well as mo&s;t numerous Fleets, and the greate&s;t Admirals that ever fought on the O|cean. In a Word, you will have a full Account of what <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Provinces</HI> have hitherto been capable of executing at Sea, and when they have been the &s;ingle Combatants.</P>
<P>But we will leave the Reader his full Liberty to make what Reflections he &s;hall think fit, and content our &s;elves with the Performance of a Faithful Hi&s;torian, by giving you a plain Relation of Matters of mo&s;t Importance in the Times we &s;hall mention, and particularly of what concerns the Great <HI>Cornelius Van Tromp,</HI> who&s;e Life we here pre&s;ent you. We have al&s;o been oblig'd, by the bye, to touch a little upon the mo&s;t remarkable Actions of the Famous
<PB REF="4"> <HI>Martin Van Tromp,</HI> and &s;everal other Admirals, who&s;e Memories will always be dear to <HI>Holland,</HI> on the Account of the great Reputation they acquir'd, as well as for their Zeal &s;hewn for the Service of their Coun|try.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint you, That we have not been able (to pre&s;erve both the Hi&s;tory contain'd, and the Succe&s;&s;ion of Years entire) to avoid relating &s;everal Events, which &s;eem to have but an indirect Tenden|cy to <HI>Cornelius Van Tromp</HI>'s Life, becau&s;e we would fill up the <HI>Cha&s;ms</HI> wherein he was not employ'd, nor commanded the Naval Forces of this State in chief, or el&s;e was in the Ser|vice of the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>
<P>And, to make the Hi&s;tory the more acceptable by Variety, we have in|&s;erted the Epitaphs of mo&s;t of the Hero's of this Republic, who&s;e Names we had occa&s;ion to Mention, as &s;o many Monuments, which contain the
<PB REF="5"> mo&s;t important Actions of their Lives, and which are not to be found el&s;e|where; whereby the Care which the <HI>United Provinces</HI> have taken to re|ward their Merit, and make their Glorious Memory Immortal, will be &s;ufficiently evident.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o added the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable Letters which the &s;everal Admirals have written, as &s;o many eminent Proofs to authenticate the Actions we relate, and which will &s;hew, that we have made this our in|violable Rule and Standard, Not to write any thing with Flattery or Fal|&s;hood, but to give a Body of Truth to this Work.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>Cornelius Tromp,</HI> Lieutenant Admiral of <HI>Holland</HI> and of <HI>We&s;t-Fri&s;eland.</HI> The Fir&s;t BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no Flouri&s;hing State in the World but mu&s;t acknowledge it &s;elf to be &s;upported chiefly by two main firm and &s;olid Pillars: I mean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1650.</NOTE> Wi&s;e Mini&s;ters of State, and Great and Ex|perienc'd Commanders, who Con&s;titute the Prima|ry Cau&s;e of it's Grandure and Exaltation. The former of the&s;e by their admirable Skill form out into Regular de&s;igns in the Councel Chamber tho&s;e Secret Maxims that Policy Dictates to every Na|tion as the mo&s;t adapted to their peculiar Genius and condition, whereby they may be&s;t Govern them|&s;elves,
<PB N="2" REF="6"> grow powerfull and become formidable to their Neighbours; and the others are tho&s;e Hero's that in order to put in Execution what was Re|&s;olved in the Cabal of State couragiou&s;ly lead on the Armies, fight the Enemies, and gloriou&s;ly ob|tain Victories: all which duly con&s;idered, what honours ought not to be rendred to the Memory of tho&s;e great men after their Deaths? Certainly it is not only ju&s;t to give them in &s;ome &s;ort a new life by the Recital of their noble Exploits, but it is likewi&s;e of great u&s;e to others, to render them Recommendable to Pro&s;terity by a Hi&s;tory of their worthy Actions, &s;ince 'tis the &s;ure&s;t and mo&s;t Ex|peditious means to move tho&s;e who read it to a like Cour&s;e of Vertue, and to excite them to fol|low the Steps of tho&s;e Illu&s;trious Hero's that have generou&s;ly Sacrificed their own private repo&s;e, and &s;pilt their be&s;t Blood for the Glory of their Coun|try. 'Twas upon this con&s;ideration that the Greeks and Romans, not to &s;peak of the Nations that pre|ceeded them, took &s;uch great care to commit to writing the lives of their Brave men, and were &s;o accurate to Paint them out to us in &s;uch lively and natural Colours, that even to this day, at that va&s;t di&s;tance whenever we Read their &s;tory, we are apt to fancy, we &s;ee them&s;elves before our Eyes. But if tho&s;e two Renowned Nations took &s;uch a Religious care to con&s;ecrate the Memory of their great Captains to Immortality, what ought not <HI>Holland</HI> to do, to Immortalize that of its Famous Admirals? If ever there were any State that has made a noi&s;e in the World, and made it &s;elf formidable by Sea, is it not this powerfull Re|publick which has done more in this re&s;pect, than all other States put together be&s;ides? It would be but needle&s;s here to repeat the Hi&s;tory of it's fir&s;t ri&s;e, and of it's progre&s;&s;es &s;ince, and to enter into &s;o long and particular a Narration as that would require, to prove a truth &s;o generally ac|knowledged. Neither as to the Hi&s;tory of our Ad|mirals,
<PB N="3" REF="6"> is our Age the fir&s;t that has employed it's writers upon &s;o noble a Subject, our Ance&s;tors have led the way, and &s;et us worthy Patterns how to acquit our &s;elves of this Ju&s;t duty. And ac|cordingly emboldened by their Example I venture to Compo&s;e the Hi&s;tory of one of tho&s;e Hero's, who without tarni&s;hing the glory of the others may be &s;aid to have been one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t Renowned Commanders that ever appeared on the Ocean, a Hero who&s;e very name was a terror to his Enemies; That was de&s;cended of a Father who had been pre&s;ent in above Fifty Sea Battles in which he either Commanded in chief, or had at lea&s;t one of the principal Po&s;ts of Au|thority, who&s;e good Conduct and undaunted cou|rage had much contributed to make <HI>Holland</HI> one of the Riche&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing States of <HI>Eu|rope;</HI> and who at la&s;t after gaining &s;o many Tri|umphs and Victories, died with Sword in hand for the advantage of his Country; a Hero, in fine, that alway followed the glorious foot &s;teps of his Illu&s;trious Father, who was as much beloved by his own Sea-men and people, as he was dread|ed by his Enemies, and who in a &s;upreme degree po&s;&s;e&s;t all the vertues of a great and accompli&s;h'd Captain.</P>
<P>We &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the fir&s;t years of the life of <HI>Cornelius Tromp,</HI> who&s;e Hi&s;tory we de&s;ign here to write, becau&s;e there u&s;ually happens nothing to men in that time of infancy that much concerns or is much worth the Curio&s;ity of the publick.</P>
<P>It will be enough only to remark to you that having been as 'twere wholly nouri&s;h'd and brought up at Sea from his mo&s;t tender youth, &s;carcely was he arrived to a Capacity of Commanding but he was made Captain of a Ship which imployment he di&s;charged with &s;o much Courage and Ability that gave the World a certain progno&s;tick, he was de&s;tinated to exerci&s;e tho&s;e of greater importance.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<P>One of the fir&s;t occa&s;ions in which he was im|ployed, and of which doubtle&s;s a particular Re|lation will be acceptable, was in the War the States were obliged to make again&s;t the Cor&s;airs of <HI>Bar|bary.</HI> For tho&s;e Pyrates taking daily a great Number of <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant-Ships, bound either to <HI>Spain,</HI> or for divers other ports in the <HI>Medi|terranean;</HI> the States at length tired out and vext with &s;o many lo&s;&s;es, gave order to <HI>John de Ga|len,</HI> Famous for his brave Actions, to Joyn him|&s;elf to the Commander <HI>de Wilde,</HI> and to the Capt. <HI>Tromp,</HI> and <HI>Van Vel&s;en,</HI> to go before <HI>Sally,</HI> and to Block up that Port by Sea, in order by that means, to put a &s;top to the Cour&s;e of it's Pira|cies.</P>
<P>He had orders to Convoy by the way, as far as <HI>Ca|diz,</HI> all Merchant-Ships going into <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Por|tugal,</HI> and to &s;teer away from thence towards <HI>Sal|ly.</HI> Accordingly Setting &s;ail and being come in|to tho&s;e Seas, he was inform'd by Captain <HI>&V;ries</HI> who was Crui&s;ing there, that no Cor&s;air had yet appeared in tho&s;e parts, becau&s;e tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> were at <HI>Inte&s;tine</HI> Jars about the Government, and that they of the old Town had taken up arms again&s;t tho&s;e of the new; but that notwith&s;tanding the differences among them&s;elves, they were unanimou&s;ly inclined to hearken to a Treaty of Peace when|ever it &s;hould be offered to them by the States General, becau&s;e they &s;tood in much fear of their power. And in effect, <HI>de Galen</HI> was no &s;ooner ar|rived thither, but a Negotiation was pre&s;ently en|tred into to draw up the Conditions of the Trea|ty.</P>
<P>In order to which, it was fir&s;t agreed upon, that as &s;oon as the <HI>Moors</HI> &s;hould have put up a White Flag in the Fort, <HI>de Galen</HI> &s;hould put up the like upon his Main-Ma&s;t-Top, for a Signal that the Deputies of <HI>Sally,</HI> might &s;afely come on Board the Admiral. At which Signal accordingly four <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Deputies came thither, whom <HI>de Galen</HI> received
<PB N="5" REF="7"> in the Captains State-Room, with great Civility. He that was the principal among&s;t them, &s;aid that the Princes both of Old and New <HI>Sally,</HI> had ex|pected with great impatience the arrival of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, in hopes of coming to a Treaty of Peace with them, to which they were entirely di&s;|po&s;ed, and &s;o much the more upon Con&s;ideration, that they had formerly lived in good Corre&s;pondence with them before they had thrown off the Yoke of tho&s;e of <HI>Morocco;</HI> for that it was &s;urprizingly &s;trange, they &s;hould whil&s;t they were yet &s;laves, have pre&s;erved Peace with a free Nation as were the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and that now &s;ince they were come out of Slavery into Liberty, they &s;hould fall out with the &s;ame people, but that the cau&s;e of all tho&s;e unhappy Ho&s;tilities that had happened &s;ince be|tween them, were to be attributed to &s;ome of their Chiefs; and that, in a word, they Ear|ne&s;tly de&s;ired, that &s;uch Rea&s;onable Conditions might be propo&s;ed, that might be the foundation of a la&s;ting Accommodation; to &s;atisfy which de&s;ire of theirs, our Admiral propo&s;ed to them the fol|lowing Articles, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That all Chri&s;tian &s;laves of what Nation &s;o|ever that had been taken on Board any</HI> Dutch <HI>Ships, &s;hould be Relea&s;ed without Ran&s;ome and without a|ny wrong done to them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That for the Future no Ship belonging to the States, &s;hould be &s;topt upon any pretence what&s;o|ever.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That no Cor&s;air Ship &s;hould be &s;uffered to go out of</HI> Sally, <HI>without giving in fir&s;t &s;ufficient &s;ecu|rity, that none of the Sates Ships &s;hould be mole&s;ted by them.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That &s;uch</HI> Dutch <HI>Ships as had been taken by the Cor&s;airs of</HI> Algier <HI>or</HI> Tunis, <HI>and brought into their Ports to be &s;old, &s;hould be Re&s;tored into the hands of their Re&s;pective owners.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="8">
<P N="5">5. <HI>That it &s;hould not be lawfull to retain any Na|tive Subject of the united Provinces, as a &s;lave, nor to &s;ell him as &s;uch within the Countries under their Juri&s;diction, but he &s;hould be immediately &s;et at Li|berty.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>That the</HI> Hollanders <HI>&s;hould Trade freely and &s;afely with them.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>That no Merchandi&s;es Imported or Exported by the</HI> Hollanders <HI>&s;hould pay any higher Duties, than tho&s;e of the</HI> Moors <HI>them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>That if it &s;o plea&s;ed their High and Mighti|ne&s;&s;es, the Sates, their Allies &s;hould likewi&s;e be in|cluded in the &s;ame Treaty. And la&s;tly that this Treaty &s;hould in all points be ob&s;erved as firmly and inviolably as the Treaty before made between the &s;aid States and the King of</HI> Morocco. <HI>It was like|wi&s;e thought fit by the Council on our &s;ide, that Captain</HI> de Uries <HI>&s;hould take Boat and go into</HI> Sal|ly, <HI>to pu&s;h on with &s;o much the more Vigour the Negotiation of the Peace.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while in &s;pite of all the vigi|lance of our men in guarding the Avenues of the Port, one of their Cor&s;airs, &s;lily gliding in along by the Ramparts, &s;tole into the Town. On the o|ther &s;ide, Captain <HI>de Wilde,</HI> was ordered to go with his Ship to <HI>Mamore</HI> a little &s;orry Town a|bout 500 paces from the main Sea, &s;ituated at the mouth of the River <HI>Subus,</HI> and twelve Miles di&s;tant from the Town of <HI>Sally,</HI> with de&s;ign to &s;top up that pa&s;&s;age from the Enemies, and to hinder them from watering there. He was re|ceived there by the Governour with great demon|&s;trations of friend&s;hip, and after he had perform|ed the Orders he had Received, he returned again to his Station before <HI>Sally,</HI> where he was extream|ly &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the Treaty of Peace broken off.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Moors</HI> were &s;o far from con&s;enting to Relea&s;e the Pri&s;oners without Ran&s;ome, that they would not endure to hear it mov'd, and tho&s;e of
<PB N="7" REF="8"> <HI>Aribal</HI> were &s;o refractary as to make a difficulty likewi&s;e of accepting the other Articles of the Trea|ty. Which ob&s;tinacy in tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> had like to have provoked the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to &s;hew their Re&s;entment by the la&s;t extremities; however, they could not forbear replying to them in &s;uch high Terms as &s;ufficiently te&s;tified how deeply they were incens'd at their proceedings. But with all this Huffing, they were not able to gain upon the <HI>Moors</HI> to make them alter a whit of their Re&s;olu|tions, nor yet by &s;everal other Negotiations by Let|ters, which produced no effect.</P>
<P>In the interim our Admiral had advice, that there had appeared about <HI>Cape</HI> St. <HI>Vincent</HI> &s;even <HI>French</HI> Privateers looking &s;harp after Merchant Ships: Upon which, <HI>de Wilde, Tromp,</HI> and <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ert,</HI> were ordered to &s;ail away towards <HI>Cadiz,</HI> to Convoy the Ships that were in that Rode, till they were out of danger, and then to make back again to ob&s;erve tho&s;e Privateers; all which did not in|terrupt the Negotiations of Peace before <HI>Sally.</HI> But &s;till the <HI>Moors</HI> would not abate an ace of their preten&s;ions concerning the Ran&s;oming the &s;laves that were to be &s;et at liberty; nay, on the con|trary, they were &s;o in&s;olent as to threaten our Fleet, that if they would not agree with them up|on their own Terms; that they would &s;end away all the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;laves they had in their power, either to <HI>Algier,</HI> or el&s;ewhere. This Menace made the Officers of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, who were then all pre&s;ent, to yield to tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> that the &s;laves &s;hould be ran&s;om'd, at the Price they were fir&s;t bought for. And as to the re&s;t of the Arti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">es there was all likelihood they would have been a|greed to, if the <HI>Moors</HI> had not changed their minds on a &s;udden, and &s;tarted abundance of New difficulties again&s;t the advancement of the Trea|ty, upon occa&s;ion of &s;ome advice that was come to them from <HI>Tetuan,</HI> which gave them hopes
<PB N="8" REF="9" MS="y"> to compa&s;s the de&s;truction of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, which was this: Nine <HI>Algerine Cor&s;airs</HI> that put in for Refre&s;hment there, had &s;ignified to them, that they had a de&s;ign to &s;urprize and &s;eize one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that were riding before <HI>Sally.</HI> Admiral <HI>de Galen</HI>'s Ship, was in mo&s;t danger, and mo&s;t expo&s;ed, becau&s;e he was often all alone. The noi&s;e of this enterprize being confirmed by <HI>de &V;ries,</HI> put the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commanders upon more Circum&s;pection in ob&s;erving the Enemies. The o|ther Ships of the Fleet tackt and &s;tood back towards the Admiral, and u&s;ed all the precautions vigilance could in&s;pire them, to avoid a &s;urprize. In the mean while, they beginning to want fre&s;h Wa|ter, <HI>Tromp</HI> was detacht away, to fetch them &s;ome from <HI>La <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ache,</HI> and returned not till Nine days after. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, <HI>de &V;ries</HI> came back on board the Admiral, with Letters, and brought with him a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Merchant. But <HI>de Galen</HI> thought not fit to make any an&s;wer to the&s;e Letters, becau&s;e he knew well enough, that the Prince of South <HI>Sally</HI> was &s;et out &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ays be|fore towards <HI>Fez,</HI> and that the Prince of North <HI>Sally</HI> was likewi&s;e to follow him in two or three days, in order to make their Treaty with the K. of <HI>Morocco,</HI> to whom the mo&s;t part of <HI>Barbary</HI> had newly &s;ubmitted, and who mo&s;t favourably received tho&s;e that were mo&s;t forward to range them&s;elves under his obedience: However <HI>de Ga|len</HI> de&s;ired the <HI>Spanish</HI> Merchant at his return to <HI>Sally,</HI> to let tho&s;e people know from him, that if they offered to &s;end away any of the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;laves to other places, as they had threatn d, that he would immediately break off the Treaty, and ne|ver enter into any Negotiation with them any more.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<P>A&s;&s;oon as the Princes of <HI>Sally</HI> were returned from <HI>Fez,</HI> they pre&s;ently &s;ent to give the Fleet notice of their arrival, &s;ignifying withall, that there was nothing they more heartily de&s;ired than a Peace, and that they pa&s;&s;ionately long'd to &s;ee the Treaty already begun, brought to a happy Conclu&s;ion. At the &s;ame time, Captain <HI>Blok,</HI> who was di&s;pacht out of the <HI>Texel</HI> to go to <HI>Sally,</HI> arrived there with orders to <HI>De Galen</HI> from the States, to go away for the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> or <HI>Rochel,</HI> to Convoy the Merchant Ships that were to go back from thence towards <HI>Holland. De Galen</HI> in pur&s;uit of tho&s;e Orders, went on board the Ship called the <HI>Ro&s;e,</HI> leaving at his departure the care of the Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty at <HI>Sally,</HI> to Captain <HI>de Wilde,</HI> and other Captains of the Fleet, who after many con|te&s;tations on both &s;ides, concluded it at length on the 9th. of <HI>February</HI> 1651, upon the following con|ditions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Governours and Princes of the two Towns of</HI> Sally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1651.

<P>After this Peace, <HI>Holland</HI> had &s;ome grounds to hope &s;he &s;hould enjoy many long years of Repo&s;e, and after having by that laid open to her &s;elf the Commerce of the <HI>Levant,</HI> &s;he might fill her Cof|fers with new Riches. But Fortune that &s;eems to have made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to keep this Republick in a perpetual agitation, made her &s;oon perceive, that the Peace &s;he had newly concluded with tho&s;e Barbarians, was de&s;igned only to prepare her for a much more bloody and dangerous War.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> at that time had erected her &s;elf into a Republick, <MILESTONE N="1652"> and expul&s;ed from the Government the Heirs of the Crown, who thereby were forced to &s;eek an <HI>A&s;ylum</HI> abroad, and implore the Succour and Protection of <HI>France</HI> and of the <HI>&V;nited Pro|vinces:</HI> And the unexperienc'd youth of King <HI>Charles</HI> the II. having &s;well'd the daring and am|bitious humour of the Protector <HI>Cromwel</HI> beyond all bounds, as &s;eeing him&s;elf Arbitrary Ma&s;ter of that potent Nation over which he Lorded it with an Empire more Ab&s;olute than that of any Crown'd Heads, <HI>Holland</HI> had rea&s;on from thence, to dread &s;ome very fatal Con&s;equences. For that new Republick
<PB N="12" REF="11"> grown in&s;olent with the many advantages &s;he had newly gain'd again&s;t the Family of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> thought there was left nothing el&s;e in the world capable to &s;top the career of her Ambition; and was &s;o wonderfully increas'd in power, that &s;he begun to grow in&s;upportable to her Neighbours, and particularly to the United Provinces, who &s;aw them&s;elves upon the point of coming to a Rupture with her. But in regard the late long War they had had with <HI>Spain</HI> had not yet given them time enough to recover their &s;trength, they cho&s;e rather to tem|porize a while with <HI>England,</HI> than to embroil them&s;elves ha&s;tily in a new War. And therefore employ'd all &s;ort of means imaginable to divert that Storm, by ha&s;tning to &s;end Amba&s;&s;adors into <HI>England.</HI> Accordingly the Heers <HI>Cats, Schaap,</HI> and <HI>Vander-perre</HI> were di&s;patcht to <HI>London</HI> in that quality, who were received there with great Ho|nours, but yet in &s;uch a manner as promis'd nothing le&s;s than a happy i&s;&s;ue of their Negotiation.</P>
<P>In the mean while; <HI>Holland</HI> was no longer able to keep &s;ilence after the many bloody outrages &s;he had received from the <HI>English.</HI> For her Merchant-Ships had &s;uffered and daily &s;uffered lo&s;&s;es that were reckoned to amount to &s;ome Millions, by the Prizes taken by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateers, to the num|ber of near two hundred Ships. Yet <HI>Holland</HI> had thi|therto &s;uffered all tho&s;e cruel Ho&s;tilities without complaining, and would not perhaps have come to an open Rupture for them: So much did &s;he dread the di&s;mal con&s;equences of a War that had no o|ther ground but Ambition, if her too great pati|ence had not at length been pu&s;ht to the la&s;t ex|tremity. But that which &s;eemed an unexampled piece of Hard&s;hip impo&s;ed by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on the <HI>Dutch,</HI> was that they pretended, they ought to be permitted even in the mid&s;t of a profound Peace, to vi&s;it not only the Merchant Ships of the States, but their Men of War too, under pretence they carried Contraband Goods to their Enemies. And be&s;ides,
<PB N="13" REF="11" MS="y"> that, they had forbidden them to traffick into that part of the <HI>I&s;lands</HI> call'd the <HI>Antilles,</HI> under their Do|minion. Notwith&s;tanding all that, the States &s;ent Or|ders to their Amba&s;&s;adors, to try all amicable ways to come, if 'twere po&s;&s;ible, to an accommodation: but when they &s;aw there was no hopes of Peace, they took at la&s;t a re&s;olution to arm, for the &s;ecurity of their Commerce. Then the Engli&s;h made no difficul|ty to declare openly to our Amba&s;&s;adors, that the Em|pire of the Sea belonged to them, that they would al|ways oppo&s;e the <HI>Hollanders</HI> keeping a Fleet there, becau&s;e that was a Right belonging to them, which their Ance&s;tors had gotten by dint of Sword from other Nations; And therefore that they would ne|ver &s;uffer any other Flagg to appear upon the Ocean, but that of their own Republick.</P>
<P>However, this Declaration hindred not the Na|val Army of the United Provinces, being then rea|dy, from di&s;po&s;ing it &s;elf to &s;et Sail under the Com|mand of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> who was pro|moted to that High Office in the year 1637, in the room of the Sieur <HI>Dorp,</HI> who quitted the Service. But before they &s;et out, <HI>Tromp</HI> de&s;ired the States to give him directions how he &s;hould behave him|&s;elf towards the Engli&s;h concerning the honour of the Flagg, of which they have in all times been ex|tremely jealous. The States askt him how he had behav'd him&s;elf in that point in the time of King <HI>Charles; Tromp</HI> replied, that when any Engli&s;h Ve&s;|&s;els happned to meet them towards <HI>Callice</HI> or near the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> e&s;pecially if the Engli&s;h were &s;tronge&s;t, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> u&s;ed to &s;alute them with &s;ome di&s;charge of their Canon, and by low|ering their Flag; upon which, the States left the matter to his di&s;cretion, to act therein according as his prudence &s;hould direct him; ordering him to do nothing to the di&s;advantage of the Nation, or prejudicial to the Glory of the State; And that he &s;hould defend their Ve&s;&s;els from all manner of attempts again&s;t any that &s;hould attack them: And
<PB N="14" REF="12"> that however, to avoid giving any new matter of jealou&s;ie to the <HI>English,</HI> he &s;hould endeavour not to go near their Coa&s;ts.</P>
<P>But a Tempe&s;t and contrary Winds hapening to ari&s;e, <HI>Tromp</HI> was forced to quit the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Hol|land</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> and much again&s;t his will, to make towards the <HI>English</HI> Coa&s;t, to &s;ave his Fleet, and to pre&s;erve it from a fatal Shipwrack, but he quitted it again as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible he could, and made towards <HI>Callis.</HI> A while after being infor|med that Seven <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant Ships Richly La|den were coming from the <HI>Streights,</HI> and that two Engli&s;h men of War and &s;ome Frigats were in que&s;t of them to take them, <HI>Tromp</HI> changed his Cour&s;e to go to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. And in his way near <HI>Dover,</HI> on the 29th. of <HI>May,</HI> he met <HI>Robert Blake</HI> Admiral for the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> having under his Command a Fleet of about 28 Capital Men of War and Frigats, that put to Sea the 5th. of <HI>May</HI> to go a crui&s;ing upon the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Low Countries. Tromp</HI> &s;eeing him di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elf to pay the u&s;ual Honours to the Banner of <HI>England,</HI> and likewi&s;e ordered a Boat to be ready to carry one of his Captains on board the Admiral to Com|pliment him. But <HI>Blake</HI> who was in the <HI>James</HI> carrying 82 Guns and 700 Men, not minding all tho&s;e marks of Submi&s;&s;ion, or at lea&s;t making as if he perceived them not, made three Canon Shots one after another at <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Ship, called the <HI>Bre|derode,</HI> carrying 54 Guns, and 250 Men, who an|&s;wered not the Engli&s;h Admiral till after the third Shot: And then 'twas, that the Fight began to grow hot, and Bloody, the two Fleets continuing to Cano|nade one another for four full hours, and then were parted more by the ob&s;curity of the night, than for having &s;atisfied the eager de&s;ire they had to fight.</P>
<P>The two Naval Armies then Sheering off into the main Sea, fell to work each of them to repair their lo&s;&s;es, and together together the ve&s;&s;els &s;hatter'd and &s;cattered in the fight. The <HI>Hollanders</HI>

<PB N="16" REF="13"> we Re&s;olved for the preventing of a greater di|&s;a&s;ter, to make towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>Dover.</HI> We got into the <HI>Downs</HI> at one a Clock, when I immediately di&s;patcht away Captain <HI>They&s;&s;en</HI> of Flu&s;hing, and Captain <HI>Allen,</HI> to Compliment <HI>Bourn,</HI> who was then Riding there with a Squadron of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet under his Command, and to de&s;ire him from me, to take no Alarm at the &s;ight of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> becau&s;e it hapned only by an unexpected effect of the Tempe&s;tuous Weather, and to a&s;&s;ure him, they had no other de&s;ign there than to re|fit their Ve&s;&s;els in order to return as &s;oon as they could, towards the Frontiers of the State, and that the Orders we had from the States Ge|neral concerned only the &s;ecurity of our Trade and Fi&s;hing, and maintaining the Glory of our Nation. <HI>Bourn</HI> having heard this Me&s;&s;age, made an&s;wer thereto with &s;ome Compliments he char|ged my two Officers to make me, de&s;iring them withall, to return me his thanks for my adver|ti&s;ement. The 29th. of the &s;ame Month, we unmoor'd with a Wind blowing fre&s;h at North-Ea&s;t, &s;teering our Cour&s;e towards <HI>Callice,</HI> with de&s;ign to go and Cruize upon our own Coa&s;ts, to refurni&s;h our &s;elves with Anchors and Cables. We met in our way, the Captain <HI>Van Saanen</HI> of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> coming from the <HI>Streights,</HI> with Captain <HI>Huntbuyt,</HI> who informed us, that being come along with Seven Merchant Ships valued at above 50 Tuns of Gold, they had left them at Anchor right again&s;t <HI>Fiverly,</HI> not far off from 12 Men of War belonging to the <HI>English</HI> Par|liament. And how that the above&s;aid <HI>Van Saa|nen,</HI> having likewi&s;e met on the 22d. of <HI>May,</HI> near to <HI>Goud&s;tart,</HI> an <HI>English</HI> Frigat that would needs have obliged him to &s;trike to her, again&s;t which he defended him&s;elf about two hours, till at la&s;t &s;he was forced to quit him; all the&s;e Circum&s;tances had obliged him to make to the Fleet,
<PB N="17" REF="13"> to give them notice in what danger the Mer|chant Ships were. This made me Re&s;olve to go to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to Re&s;cue them out of the hands of the Enemies, according to the 7th. and 8th. Article of my Commi&s;&s;ion. In our way we met 15 of the Parliaments men of War, or Frigats, upon which I pre&s;ently lower'd my Sails, and &s;truck my Flag, in order to pay the Honours due to the Banner of <HI>England.</HI> Being come within Cannon &s;hot, the <HI>English</HI> Admiral let flie a &s;hot at me, to which I made no An&s;wer; he then gave me another, to which I An&s;wer'd, upon which he let flie a whole Broad &s;ide at me, which made &s;o great Havock on board me, that &s;everal of my men were Wounded, and &s;ome of them had their Arms or Legs &s;hot off. I then like|wi&s;e di&s;charged a Broad &s;ide at him, yet was not able all this while to di&s;cover what the <HI>English</HI> mean't by this, &s;o great a &s;ilence there was kept on both &s;ides.

In the mean while Major <HI>Bourn</HI> being come out of the <HI>Downs</HI> with a Squadron of 12 men of War, or Frigats, whereof the fir&s;t carried from 60 to 70 pieces of Cannon, and the others from 38 to 50, came and fell thundring upon our Rear. So the Fight being begun at 4 in the afternoon, la&s;ted till 9, and was not broken off but by the ob&s;curity of the Night. Then we made out into the Main Sea, and the Ships of both Fleets tack't about to|wards their Admirals, to refit them&s;elves. We remained all the Night, hanging lights out in e|very Ship.

Upon the advice Major <HI>Bourn</HI> gave me, that <HI>Tromp</HI> appear'd toward the Souther-&s;and with a Fleet of 40 &s;ail, I u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible diligence
<PB N="19" REF="14"> to get up with him. Ye&s;terday we di&s;covered him below <HI>Dover</HI> Rode, and being come within 3 miles of him, <HI>Tromp</HI> unmoored with an Ea&s;terly Wind, which made us think he endeavoured to avoid us, becau&s;e of the di&s;pute about the Flag. About two hours after, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet changing it's cour&s;e, tackt about, and &s;tood right towards us, <HI>Tromp</HI> be|ing at the head of this motion. We put our &s;elves into a line of Battle, not doubting but <HI>Tromp</HI>'s intention was to Engage. When the two Fleets were come within Musket &s;hot of one another, I made a &s;hot at his Flagg, which I Repeated three times: After the third &s;hot, <HI>Tromp</HI> let flie at us a whole broad &s;ide.

The next Morning at break of day, we di&s;cover'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet about 4 miles from us, making towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> We Judged fit in a Councel of War, to keep the Weather gage of them, to prevent a &s;urprize, in ca&s;e they &s;hould Charge us again, that &s;o at the wor&s;t, we might have nothing el&s;e to do but to cut the Cables of our Anchors.

But however we are a&s;&s;ur'd, that one of their Ships is &s;unk, and that we have taken another from them of 30 guns, with two Captains. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Ships hav|ing her Main Ma&s;t &s;hot by the Board, and leak|ing on all &s;ides, Captain <HI>Laar&s;ons</HI> was fain to quit her.

For the Country people in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> were &s;o alarmed at this news, that many of them de&s;erted their hou&s;es, and others came and Complain'd to the Parliament, Repre&s;enting to them what great danger their Coa&s;ts were as being the mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed to an Inva&s;ion, and putting them in fear that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would come and Ravage the whole Country. Upon which, <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> then General of all the Forces of <HI>England,</HI> and who was the <HI>Primum mobile</HI> of that Infant-Repub|lick,
<PB N="21" REF="15"> immediately &s;et out towards the Maritime pla|ces, as well to appea&s;e the peoples di&s;turbed Spirits, as to inform him&s;elf of the particulars of the fight. Some Regiments were likewi&s;e detach'd from the Army, and order'd to march towards the Sea Coa&s;ts, which were Quarter'd at <HI>Greenwich, Grave&s;end, Sandwich,</HI> and <HI>Dover.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Cromwell</HI> having carefully Examined into all the reports of the Battle, was very ill &s;atisfied at it, and &s;o much the more becau&s;e Captain <HI>Wil|liam Brandley,</HI> and Captain <HI>Dennis Bond,</HI> both <HI>En|glish</HI> Men that were in <HI>Dover</HI> Ca&s;tle at that time, agreed together, as well as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains, <HI>Tuynemans</HI> and <HI>Sipke Fokkes,</HI> who were pri&s;oners, that it was their opinion, that <HI>Blake</HI> had made three &s;hots at <HI>Tromp,</HI> before he offered to defend him|&s;elf. After &s;uch a di&s;covery as that, <HI>Cromwell</HI> re|turned to the Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> and at his arri|val, all was pacified, and the unruly <HI>Mobb</HI> quietly laid down their arms.</P>
<P>However what had pa&s;t, left no Room for any to doubt, but that a War would thereupon break out between tho&s;e two potent Republicks, tho' both par|ties endeavoured to excu&s;e and Ju&s;tifie them&s;elves of any blame in the matter, becau&s;e they were loth to pa&s;s for the Authors of the &s;ad-di&s;a&s;ters that mu&s;t needs en&s;ue thereon. For the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> pre|tended, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were the Aggre&s;&s;ors, but they maintained the contrary. <HI>Tromp</HI> having writ a Letter to the States with all the Circum|&s;tances of the Fight, as we have already &s;een, cau|&s;ed likewi&s;e a more exact information to be drawn up of the whole matter of Fact, which was &s;ign|ed by Forty <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers of the Fleet. It con|tained the whole account of that action, and of all it's particulars; and all the Captains unani|mou&s;ly agreed in their report, that <HI>Tromp</HI> had no other de&s;ign in this Expedition, than to maintain the freedom of Commerce, and that he intended to pay the honours due to the <HI>English</HI> Flag, but that
<PB N="22" REF="16"> Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> had made three &s;hot at him with his Guns, before he made any at him, till at la&s;t his Pa|tience being pu&s;ht to the utmo&s;t extremity, he found him&s;elf obliged to an&s;wer him in the like Language, at the third di&s;charge.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide all the Captains of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, being likewi&s;e called together by the Admi|ral's command, drew up a <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> by which, after they had related all the Circum&s;tances of the fight, they pretended to prove, that <HI>Tromp</HI> came up to the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, only to dare them, tho' he again&s;t all &s;ence, thought to excu&s;e him|&s;elf under the &s;pecious pretence of coming only to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant Fleet, when it was well known they had already weighed An|chor, and pa&s;t by the <HI>Saturday</HI> before, in &s;ight of Admiral <HI>Blake,</HI> who never made the lea&s;t offer to attack them. That <HI>Tromp</HI> with a very Criminal boldne&s;s coming to an Anchor before <HI>Dover,</HI> ne|ver made offer to &s;alute the Ca&s;tle, tho' the Ca&s;tle had di&s;charged three Guns, at three different times, to give him notice of his duty; but that yet <HI>Tromp</HI> out of contempt, di&s;&s;embling that he per|ceived it, remained in his po&s;t all Night, and next day till Noon, without &s;triking his Flag. And to add the more weight to this <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> added &s;ome Articles of the orders that <HI>Tromp</HI> had given the Captains of his Fleet; which the <HI>English</HI> had gotten information of from the two <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains they had taken pri&s;oners. They contained among other things,</P>
<Q><P N="1">I. That the Chiefs or Captains of Squadrons al|ready Equip'd, or to be hereafter Equip'd, had Expre&s;s Orders to take care to pre&s;erve the ve&s;|&s;els belonging to the&s;e Provinces, and not to &s;uf|fer them to be vi&s;ited; without compri&s;ing there|in, the di&s;putes that nece&s;&s;arily happen at Sea concerning the pa&s;sports and Evidences that e|very Ship whatever &s;he be, is obliged to &s;hew at the fir&s;t demand, according to the Marine Trea|ty

<P N="2">II.

<P N="4">IV. It was moreover expre&s;ly forbidden them, to pay any &s;alutes with their Guns, by way of ho|nour to any, unle&s;s upon very good grounds;
<PB N="24" REF="17"> that however, if they chanced to come near a|ny Foreign Man of War, which they were un|der a kind of an Engagement to &s;alute, becau&s;e it concerned the honour of the United Provin|ces &s;o to do, they &s;hould in &s;uch ca&s;es, u&s;e great Circum&s;pection, e&s;pecially if the Chiefs or Cap|tains of &s;uch Foreign Ships &s;hould have fir&s;t &s;alu|ted the Lieutenant General, or him that commands in his place, but above all, they were to take care, it might be done without damage.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e when any of the Ships of the Fleet be|ing &s;ent a crui&s;ing to Sea, &s;hould di&s;cover any Foreign Ship; or, that &s;he got Intelligence that Warlike preparations were making any where, and that Ships were gathering together, to com|po&s;e a Fleet, then the &s;aid Ship was to get the exacte&s;t information po&s;&s;ible, of the Number of their Men of War, and of their Arms, Guns, and Men, that &s;he &s;hould take good notice, which way they &s;teer'd, and whether in their pa&s;&s;age, they offer'd to commit any act of Ho&s;tility. That in this ca&s;e, they &s;hould give the Admiral advice of it with all the diligence imaginable, who thereupon, was to give the following Orders, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;couts be &s;ent to all parts of the Seas, that all the Ships of the Fleet &s;hould repair to the appointed <HI>Rendevous,</HI> where they &s;hould con|&s;ult together what de&s;ign the Fleet &s;o di&s;cover|ed might have, what cour&s;e they &s;teer'd, and in|to what Harbour they would enter, whether in|to one of the ports belonging to the States, or &s;ome other.

<P>From which Articles and In&s;tructions of <HI>Tromp</HI> to his Officers, tho' the <HI>English</HI> pretended to draw invincible proofs, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were the Ag|gre&s;&s;ors in the late bloody attempt upon their Fleet, yet the <HI>Dutch</HI> on the contrary, pretended it was vi&s;ible from thence, that their main Aim was only to &s;ecure their Trade, and defend the Glo|ry of their Nation, in ca&s;e they were attackt, but that they had not the lea&s;t de&s;ign to be Aggre&s;&s;ors again&s;t the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>After this Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> whil&s;t he was Crui&s;ing below <HI>Bullen,</HI> writ a Letter to Ad|miral <HI>Blake,</HI> dated the 2d. of <HI>June,</HI> in which he intreated him to relea&s;e the two Capt. of his, he had made Pri&s;oners, and who were already carried to <HI>London,</HI> and to order the Re&s;titution of Captain <HI>Tuyneman</HI>'s Ship.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t Honourable Lords.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE expected nothing le&s;s than the fatal di&s;a|&s;ter which has lately hapned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Amba&s;&s;a|dors Audi|ence of the Parliament and their Speech to them.</NOTE> And if what Publick Fame &s;ays, of a Sea fight between the two Fleets, prove true, this di&s;grace is &s;o much the greater and more afflicting to us, becau&s;e our Men are lookt upon as the Authors of it. All tho&s;e &s;tories that are whi&s;per'd about concerning this matter, are already lookt upon by the people, as the mournful pre&s;ages of the ruine of two States that have hi|therto been ever linkt together in a &s;trict Alliance, and now by this fatal blow, &s;ee them&s;elves at the eve of a Bloody War. We are &s;o &s;en&s;ibly concern'd at all the fal&s;e Rumours that are &s;pread abroad to the di&s;advantage of our Nation, that we will call God to witne&s;s, that the States General were &s;o far from contributing to the late unhappy recoun|ter, that they had not the lea&s;t knowledge of it, and de&s;ire nothing &s;o much as &V;nion, Peace, and an inviolable Friend&s;hip with <HI>England.</HI> However 'tis not impertinent to the matter in que&s;tion, to let you know, that it may be ob&s;erv'd from the Let|ter
<PB N="28" REF="19"> written to us by the Admiral of <HI>Holland,</HI> that the true Cau&s;e of that action was very different from what 'tis reported to have been: And what is more, <HI>Tromp</HI> declares in that Letter, in ex|pre&s;s terms, and he repeats it three times, that he had not received any other Orders from the States, than only to defend the Merchant Ships belonging to the States, from the oppre&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e who might be capable to di&s;turb the freedom of their Commerce, and to Crui&s;e upon the Frontiers of the State with|out going far from <HI>O&s;tend</HI> and <HI>Newport;</HI> from whence 'tis as clear as the day, That the States General of the &V;nited Provinces never had any thoughts to attempt any thing that might be capable to break the &s;trict union that has always been be|tween <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland.</HI> And if any thing has hapned contrary to the &s;incerity of their intenti|ons, they who &s;hall be found to have violated the Rules, and pa&s;&s;ed the Bounds that were pre&s;cribed them, ought to be Re&s;pon&s;ible for it.</P>
<P>According to the Orders given us by their High and Mightine&s;&s;es, to endeavour a Treaty of Alli|ance, we pre&s;ented &s;ome days ago to your Com|mi&s;&s;ioner, a Memorial, in which we propo&s;e means, not only for compo&s;ing the differences about Com|merce, but likewi&s;e for the &s;ecuring of it, and ren|dering it more flouri&s;hing. And we de&s;ire nothing el&s;e at pre&s;ent but to &s;ee them brought to a &s;peedy and happy conclu&s;ion. And indeed who could believe, that a Treaty that is at pre&s;ent the firme&s;t &s;upport of good and well di&s;po&s;ed people, and the mo&s;t &s;olid foundation of the Reformation, &s;hould be interrup|ted by the capricious humour of a few ill intention|ed per&s;ons? It is a Natural Law acknowledged by all the World, That, in Private Affairs, if an At|torney or Proctor; or in Publick Affairs, if a Mi|ni&s;ter of State, offers to pa&s;s the Duties of his Of|fice; or if a General of an Army, without any Order from his Soveraign, Ravages and lays Wa&s;t the
<PB N="29" REF="19"> Countries of his Allies, or like a wild unruly Bea&s;t that has broken his Chains, runs about the Fields and does all the mi&s;chief he can, then in &s;uch a ca&s;e, it is but Ju&s;tice to hold the Soveraigns blame|le&s;s, and to charge the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rime upon tho&s;e who are the true Authors of it; and e&s;pecially if the Soveraigns di&s;avow the Fact, as there is rea&s;on to expect, the States will do in the ca&s;e now in debate. However there is no doubt, but that it would be a thing al|together unheard of, and condemned both by Divine and Humane Laws, to go about to commit any acts of Ho&s;tility, without hearing fir&s;t what rea&s;ons the Adver&s;ary had to alledge for him&s;elf. 'Tis a Max|ime univer&s;ally received by all Nations conducted by the light of Rea&s;on, That when any mi&s;chievous fact is committed, the examination of the crime, &s;hould precede before Sentence be given; But like|wi&s;e, if the Party offended receive ample &s;atisfa|ction, ought he not to lay by his Re&s;entment? And it is not to be wondred at, if all Nations natu|rally avoid War, and are inclined to Peace, &s;ince War is a horrible Mon&s;ter that cau&s;es a thou&s;and unhappi|ne&s;&s;es and feeds upon nothing but innocent Blood. Some holy Fathers of the Church have very truly and perti|nently &s;aid, That men ought to have War in abo|mination, even when Ju&s;tice or Nece&s;&s;ity it &s;elf obliges them by force to take Arms, but e&s;peci|ally Chri&s;tians, who ought to have learnt to be &s;pa|ring of the Blood of other people as well as of that of their own Subjects. Experience &s;hews us in na|tural things, that when the mo&s;t excellent Wines come to corrupt, they change into Vinegar mo&s;t extrem|ly &s;harp. So likewi&s;e if the&s;e two Nations that have for &s;o many years been united together, in Religion, Commerce and Liberty, and whom the Neighbourhood of the Sea, the Glory of Arms, and their known valour have rendred yet more in|&s;eparable, &s;hould come once to break that &V;nion, what el&s;e mu&s;t be expected thence but their com|mon Ruine? Would not they be then like th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sons
<PB N="30" REF="20"> of the Earth, that de&s;troyed one another, as we are told in the &s;tory of <HI>Cadmus?</HI> And will not even our Religion be thereby expo&s;ed to contempt; and will not our common Enemies draw from our trou|bles new matter of triumph?</P>
<P>Truly our &s;en&s;e in this ca&s;e differs nothing from that of &s;ome of your Writers, who have very ju|diciou&s;ly compared our two Republicks to two Earth|en Ve&s;&s;els floating on the Sea, with this <HI>Motto, Si collidimur fragimur, i. e.</HI> If we fall foul on one another, we &s;hall certainly break. That is an Em|blem that admirably well &s;hews that a perpetual Peace ought to render them in&s;eparable. For if a well cemented &V;nion might once be &s;ettled be|tween the&s;e two Nations, what felicities are there they might not enjoy? By that, we &s;hall &s;ee Reli|gion firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Sea open to us, Navi|gation free, and the Enemies of the two Nations put out of all power to hurt them, Peace and Tran|quility &s;ecured, and what is &s;till more to be de&s;ired, the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven entailed upon us. In fine, to conclude, we therefore mo&s;t earne&s;tly be&s;eech you, that you would order a Copy of a Relation of the late fight as it really pa&s;&s;ed, to be delivered to us, and to permit us to &s;end it to the States General of the &V;nited Provinces, that by examining care|fully the relations of both Parties, the truth may the more ea&s;ily be detected; That in the mean while, all Ho&s;tilities may cea&s;e on both &s;ides. That the Negotiation for a Treaty of Peace, may not be broken off on this occa&s;ion, That &s;o by re|medying the misfortunes lately hapned, we may at la&s;t effect the conclu&s;ion of a &s;olid and durable Peace, which we pa&s;&s;ionately wi&s;h for, and which we pray God the Soveraign Arbiter and Lord of Peace, to be plea&s;ed to grant us.</P>

<P>After this di&s;cour&s;e, the Amba&s;&s;adours retired, and were guarded home to their Lodgings by a Party of the Engli&s;h Guards. The Parliament &s;eemed to them to be extremely divided, and to
<PB N="31" REF="20"> waver much in their Re&s;olutions about &s;o weighty and Nice a Point, but yet without po&s;i|tively declaring, which of the Admirals they judg|ed to have begun the Fight.

The re&s;t of the Parliament being &s;tirred up by the &s;ecret practices of the Spani&s;h Faction, &s;aid, that the Hollanders had by the late action given an evident proof of their Treachery; That the Republick of <HI>England</HI> had rea&s;on to be much alarmed at it, and to look upon it as an a&s;&s;ured pre&s;age of their future Ruine. Yet there were &s;e|veral Members of that Illu&s;trious Body, whether moved by &s;ome private intere&s;t, or by a principle of friend&s;hip, that were more inclined to an accommo|dation with the Hollanders than to a Rupture, in the number of which, were the&s;e Gentlemen, <HI>viz. Mildmay, Vane, Pembrook,</HI> and &s;everal others: But <HI>Cromwel</HI> who was in the highe&s;t degree of his for|tune, of which he made his Idol, was the only man that had the &s;ecret of working upon the &s;pirits of that Nation. His Party was backt by <HI>Harri&s;on, Whitlock, Brad&s;haw, St. Johns, Harrington, Fleetwood,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Scot,</HI> who fomented the Jea|lou&s;ies and lying &s;tories that the hatred the peo|ple had conceived again&s;t the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had lately produced, nay, and they had blown up the flame to &s;o great a height, that they re|ported, that <HI>Tromp</HI> was come to <HI>London</HI> with a de&s;ign to make a general Ma&s;&s;acre of the people; but his enterpri&s;e not taking effect, he had com|manded tho&s;e of his Fleet, to put all the Engli&s;h they met with to the Sword; and that be&s;ides, he had given orders to all his Captains upon pain of Death, that at the approach of any Engli&s;h Man of War, if they found them&s;elves in danger of being taken, having got all their Seamen upon the Deck, they &s;hould clap a lighted Match into their Powder-room, as well to de&s;troy their Ene|mies
<PB N="32" REF="21"> by blowing them up into the Air, as to take from them all hopes of any Booty. The Sieur <HI>Nieuport</HI> who was &s;ent &s;ome weeks before, as well to carry &s;ome Papers to the Amba&s;&s;adors concerning their Negotiation, as to tell them &s;e|veral things by word of mouth that were intru|&s;ted with him by the States, run great danger of his life, becau&s;e he was taken for a Spie. In a word, the mutual hatred between both Nations was ri&s;en to that high degree of bitterne&s;s, that there was rea&s;on to fear they would never be re|conciled more.</P>

<P>The Sieur <HI>Newport</HI> having expedited his affairs, waited only for a Pa&s;&s;port to be gone, but he found great difficulty to obtain it, which retarded his departure for &s;everal days.

<Q><P>The Parliament of the Commonwealth of <HI>England,</HI> reflecting upon all the proofs of bene|volence and &s;incere Friend&s;hip, they have of|ten given to the States General of the United Provinces, even from the fir&s;t beginning of the troubles of this Kingdom, having omitted no|thing of what might conduce to the main|taining a perfect Corre&s;pondence between them
<PB N="36" REF="23"> and it, and render their union much more &s;trict than ever before, find them&s;elves at pre&s;ent hai|nou&s;ly offended by an unexpected attempt, which is an act of Ho&s;tility committed upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t the Fleet of the Re|publick, after a mature deliberation, and exa|mination of the Writings which their Excellen|cies the Amba&s;&s;adors of the United Provinces have put into our Hands, we have thought fit to make them the pre&s;ent An&s;wer.</P>
<P>Tho the Parliament were inclined out of a principle of affection and tenderne&s;s, to receive favourably the expre&s;&s;ions contained in the a|bove&s;aid writings, tending to repre&s;ent the late Fight between the two Fleets, as a thing that hapened without the knowledge and again&s;t the will of their High and Mightine&s;&s;es, yet upon due reflection made thereon, it appears, That the Re&s;olutions of the States; and the Conduct of their Admirals do no ways agree with all tho&s;e prote&s;tations, e&s;pecially in a time whil&s;t a Trea|ty of Alliance was managing, which they them|&s;elves had &s;ought for, and which had been Ne|gotiated by their own Amba&s;&s;adors. Be&s;ides, what could be the &s;cope of &s;o formidable an Arming of 150 Ships of War, made by them without any occa&s;ion for it, was it not for the de&s;ign which has now lately broken out? Which is nothing el&s;e but the effect of a real jealou&s;ie, even by the confe&s;&s;ion of the Amba&s;&s;adors them|&s;elves, at the &s;ame time they pretend to excu&s;e them&s;elves of it; and according to the Tenour of the Commi&s;&s;ions their High and Mightine&s;|&s;es have given to the Chief Commanders of their Naval Armies, there are but too many rea&s;ons that per&s;wade us to believe, that the States do thereby but a&s;pire to Ravi&s;h from <HI>England</HI> by force of Arms, her ancient Prerogatives, and the Rights &s;he has over the Seas; and that fur|ther, they aim at nothing el&s;e but the de&s;tructi|on
<PB N="37" REF="23"> of our Fleet; which is our Barrier, and our &s;ecure&s;t Rampart, and by that means to expo&s;e this Commonwealth to an Inva&s;ion, as they in|tended to do by the late attempt. Upon which, the Parliament think them&s;elves indi&s;pen&s;ably engaged with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven to exact &s;peedy &s;atis|faction for the outrages done to the Nation, and to put them&s;elves in &s;uch a condition that the like may happen no more for the future. And yet they do all this with de&s;ign however to appea&s;e if po&s;&s;ible the Troubles that have lately ri&s;en be|tween the two Nations, by all ways of Humanity and moderation, if God who by his Wi&s;dom and Almighty Power, is able to do all things, &s;hall plea&s;e to furni&s;h us with more proper and efficacious means for that end, than have been hi|therto employed.</P></Q>
<P>This An&s;wer, together with that proud and haughty way the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have with them, begun to give new alarms to <HI>Holland,</HI> and make her fear the Con&s;equences would be fatal. It was a very &s;en&s;ible Vexation to the States, to &s;ee them|&s;elves upon the point of coming to a Rap|ture with that New Republick, who&s;e happy progre&s;&s;es in her beginnings had made them con|ceive fair hopes, that &s;he would let her Allie <HI>Holland</HI> &s;hare with her in the pro&s;perities &s;he enjoyed by the good Corre&s;pondence and &s;trict Friend&s;hip which was like to Reign between them. The Merchants were almo&s;t out of their Wits at it, by rea&s;on of the great lo&s;s they daily &s;uf|fered both of their Ships and Goods, which un|happily became a Prey to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateers. Which obliged the States, before the Negotiati|on already begun was quite broken off, to di&s;|patch another Extraordinary Amba&s;&s;age to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> being willing to appea&s;e all di&s;putes by A|micable ways, if it were po&s;&s;ible to find out a|ny means to do it, and it being nece&s;&s;ary for that

But becau&s;e, by rea&s;on of the
<PB N="39" REF="24"> incon&s;tancy of worldly things, there often hap|pen unlucky accidents and di&s;orders in Humane life, that change the State of affairs, and &s;eem to cover over its face with a thick and &s;able Cloud that ob&s;cures for a time that agreeable Union, and happy mutual Benevolence, there is need of a great deal of precaution to &s;top its mi&s;chiev|ous Con&s;equences; above all, if it be con&s;idered, that when &s;uch kind of troubles are timely &s;ti|fled in their birth, and that unhappy mi&s;under|&s;tanding &s;tarted by them comes once to cea&s;e, it may be &s;aid, they &s;erve more to &s;trengthen and confirm that mutual Union, than any way to weaken or di&s;&s;olve its Bonds.</P>
<P>'Tis for this de&s;ign, that my Mrs. the States General of the United provinces, have been plea|&s;ed to &s;end me in Quality of their Amba&s;&s;ador ex|traordinary to the Parliament of the Common|wealth of <HI>England,</HI> tho' otherwi&s;e they had no rea&s;on to doubt either of the Prudence or of the Capacity of the Amba&s;&s;adors they had here al|ready for Affairs of high importance. I am there|fore &s;ent, to a&s;&s;ure the Commonwealth of <HI>Eng|land</HI> from them, of the &s;incere and inviolable de|&s;ire they have to &s;ee its Government continue in that Peace, Happine&s;s and Pro&s;perity which at pre&s;ent it enjoys, and to offer it at the &s;ame time, all the &s;ervices they are capable of. And I can give you this Te&s;timony of them with the more a&s;&s;ured fidelity, becau&s;e having always been pre|&s;ent in their a&s;&s;emblies, and coming now but new|ly out of them, I have been an Eye witne&s;s of the zeal and ardent pa&s;&s;ion they have, to contribute all that lies in their power, that may po&s;&s;ibly con|duce to the maintaining a firm and &s;olid Friend|&s;hip between the two States, and to prevent all that may &s;hake it. And therefore 'twas with great A&s;toni&s;hment, and with a very &s;en&s;ible Re|gret they heard of what has pa&s;t between the Ad|mirals of the two Republicks; and for fear that
<PB N="40" REF="25"> fatal Rencounter altogether unexpected &s;hould cau&s;e &s;ome new mi&s;-under&s;tandings and rai&s;e new Jealou&s;ies, or that by putting a &s;top to the pre&s;ent Treaty, it might make it impracticable to come to a conclu&s;ion of a Renovation of the Anci|ent Amity that has always been between the two Nations, the States, my Mrs. judg'd it nece&s;|&s;ary I &s;hould come hither, becau&s;e having been always pre&s;ent at all their deliberations by rea&s;on of my Employment, I was be&s;t able to Repre|&s;ent to the Commonwealth of <HI>England,</HI> the na|ked truth, and all the Circum&s;tances of that Acti|on, as they have been related to them, in order to the ra&s;ing out all &s;u&s;picions that might be capa|ble to di&s;temper or de&s;troy the good intelligence and true Amity that is between the two Nations, and remove all ob&s;tacles that might, hinder the conclu&s;ion of the Treaty already began.</P>
<P>Moreover I prote&s;t and declare in the pre&s;ence of the Parliament of the Republick of <HI>England</HI> by vertue of my Credential Letters; and in the Name of the States General, my Mrs. that they never had any thoughts to attempt any thing, or give order, that any thing &s;hould be attempted that might give any ju&s;t cau&s;e of Umbrage to the Sovereign power of this Commonwealth, to break or weaken the Union and good Corre|&s;pondence that has been &s;o long cultivated be|tween the two Republicks, or under what pre|tence &s;oever, to &s;ow any di&s;cord between them. But rather on the contrary, I can &s;ay, that the States have been moved by their own inclinations, and by the &s;entiments of a real Friend&s;hip, care|fully to &s;tudy out all that might conduce to the ha&s;tning the conclu&s;ion of a &s;trict and inviolable Alliance between the two Nations. It's true a very con&s;iderable Fleet was Equip'd in <HI>Holland,</HI> but at the &s;ame time there's no body but knows, the States were forced &s;o to do by the continual complaints of their Subjects, and that they gave
<PB N="41" REF="25"> notice of it to the Parliament. And they publi&s;h|ed beforehand, that this arming was for no o|ther end than for the liberty and &s;ecurity of Commerce, which was much endamag'd and in|terrupted by many very &s;en&s;ible Lo&s;&s;es the Sub|jects of the United Provinces daily &s;uffered of their Ships and Goods; and certainly, it is but natural to make u&s;e of the means that force and nece&s;&s;ity put into our hands, to protect oppre&s;|ed innocence: But they thoughr of nothing le&s;s than a fight, to create new troubles between the two Nations, and Revive the di&s;putes that were already terminated. But things being &s;o, and there hapning by accident a fierce Battle between the Fleets of the two Nations, the States General have thought fit to Communicate to the Parlia|ment of <HI>England</HI> an exact and faithfull Relation of all that pa&s;&s;ed, &s;uch as they have received from their Admiral, authorized by the Te&s;timony of all the Captains and other per&s;ons worthy of Credit: namely, that Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> came to|wards the Fleet of this Republick, more by ne|ce&s;&s;ity than out of any premeditated de&s;ign, and that after he had paid his Civilities to Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> as he was pur&s;uing his voyage, he fell into the pre&s;ence of Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> before he was a|ware; that pre&s;ently he ordered an advice Boat to be made ready, to &s;end &s;ome Officers of the Fleet to Compliment him, but that <HI>Blake</HI> an&s;wering him with Civilities of a quite contrary nature, let flie all his Guns at him, and that then <HI>Tromp</HI> di&s;|charg'd his, more to defend him&s;elf, than to of|fend the Aggre&s;&s;or. This was the cau&s;e of an En|gagement, in which, the Capricious humour of Fortune had more &s;hare than any de&s;ign of Coun|cil premeditated, and &s;well'd up with Ambition, &s;o that it being begun about a mi&s;taken point of Honour, and not continued by our men out of a|ny principle of animo&s;ity, the States General pray the Commonwealth of <HI>England,</HI> to be per|&s;waded,
<PB N="42" REF="26"> they had no hand in that Action, but to take it for an Event of pure chance, and of the in|con&s;tancy of Worldly affairs, and that accord|ingly they would be plea&s;ed to recall their Or|ders and Commi&s;&s;ions, and to let all Acts of Ho|&s;tility cea&s;e that now di&s;turb Commerce, and the States on their part, are ready to con&s;ent to the &s;ame, and always to employ all po&s;&s;ible means to facilitate an Accommodation.</P>
<P>They are very &s;en&s;ible, that all Chri&s;tendom is deeply concerned in &s;o great an affair as this, and e&s;pecially the reformed Churches of all <HI>Europe,</HI> who all equally wi&s;h and de&s;ire, that our troubles may be &s;tifled in their Birth, as being per&s;waded, that di&s;cord ari&s;ing between Neighbouring States of the &s;ame Religion, may not only draw after it the Ruin of that Commerce that makes them Flouri&s;h, but likewi&s;e awaken the drooping hopes of both their &s;ecret and open Enemies, who would not fail to take occa&s;ion thereupon, to fo|ment &s;ome new Plots in &s;ome Province or other of this Commonwealth which would afterwards break out, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing from one to another, we &s;hould &s;ee our States become the bloody Theater of a War. To prevent therefore and put a &s;top to the Cour&s;e of &s;o great mi&s;chiefs, I have Orders without further delay, to Repre|&s;ent to you, and employ all my indu&s;try that &s;ome a&s;&s;ur'd means may be agreed upon on both &s;ides to accommodate the differences about what has pa&s;t, and for the taking &s;uch ju&s;t Mea&s;ures for the future, that there may never happen the like accidents again between the two Fleets; and that &s;o thereby the Greatne&s;s and Glory of the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> may be &s;ecured from the danger of all &s;orts of attempts again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Since then the States General openly declare to the Parliament the ardent pa&s;&s;ion they have to &s;ee the two Nations perfectly United toge|ther and their differences entirely compo&s;ed, and
<PB N="43" REF="26"> that the propo&s;itions on both &s;ides may at la&s;t terminate in a &s;trict Alliance, all the favour I de&s;ire of the Parliament, is that they would plea&s;e to give order to their Commi&s;&s;ioners, and to the Council of State, to give me &s;peed|dy Audience, and to labour joyntly with me for the Conclu&s;ion of the Treaty, in order to terminate the principal bu&s;ine&s;s that is the foundation of my Negotiation, as well as of that of the other Amba&s;&s;adors In extraordina|ry, of the States.</P>
<P>In the mean while, I acknowledge my &s;elf infinitely obliged to the Parliament, that they have been plea&s;ed to grant a Ship to Mr. <HI>Nieu|port</HI> to repa&s;s the Sea, and go into <HI>Holland;</HI> I will add here, that being a Member of the State, he has had order to remain with me, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with his Council, till my return, which I dare be confident, the Parliament will not take ill; and that they will be plea&s;ed favourably to accept my mo&s;t humble &s;ervices which I pre|&s;ent them.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>de Heem&s;ted</HI> going the next day to the Council of State,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>de Heem&s;ted</HI>'s Speech to the Coun|cil of State.</NOTE> made them the following Speech, which he pronounced in <HI>French.</HI> Since it has plea&s;ed my Lor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, the States General of the United Provinces be&s;ides the Amba&s;&s;adors they have already here, to &s;end me extraordi|narily in the &s;ame Quality to the Parliament of the Republick of <HI>England,</HI> to whom I had the Honour ye&s;terday in a full A&s;&s;embly, to declare the Subject of my Amba&s;&s;age, and the &s;incerity of the intentions of the High and Migh|ty Lords, my Mrs. I thought my &s;elf indi&s;pen|&s;ably obliged to appear before this <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> Council, as well to pre&s;ent them my Creden|tial Letters, as to a&s;&s;ure them for my own par|ticular, how much I tender the pro&s;perity they enjoy in the management of tho&s;e great and important affairs intru&s;ted to them by the Com|monwealth
<PB N="44" REF="27"> and which they di&s;charge with &s;o much Wi&s;dom and Prudence. And as I have already declared to the Parliament, &s;o I Reiterate again here, that the States General de&s;ire nothing &s;o much as the Continuation of a good, and in|timate Corre&s;pondence, and the Renewing of a durable and &s;olid Friend&s;hip with <HI>England,</HI> of which they had in &s;everal Rencounters given very &s;ignal marks. It is Certain, the States, my Mrs. wi&s;h nothing more heartily, than to &s;ee the Trea|ty of Peace brought to a Conclu&s;ion, and the U|nion between the two Republicks, thereby Re-e&s;tabli&s;ht and Corroborated, and all Sub|jects of hatred and mi&s;-under&s;tanding that might be able to di&s;turb it, thereby entirely di&s;pell'd. Gentleman, it is the Aim of the Enemies of the Reformation, by Divi&s;ions, not only to weaken but totally to ruin the two Republicks, but the two Nations having received &s;o many great marks of the ble&s;&s;ing of God, as well by their par+taking in the true Religion of which they are the tru&s;ty Guardians, as by the prodigies that have appear'd in their foundation and e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, in &s;everal parts of the World, whither they have &s;o happily advanced Commerce in &s;pite of all the dangers of the Seas; the States, my Mrs. Judge it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to maintain Religion, and &s;trengthen our Republicks which cannot be effected otherwi&s;e than by a happy Complication, and an agreeable confu&s;ion of their Riches and common Intere&s;ts; that will be the true means with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Hea|ven to prevent all that may be capable to trou|ble their happine&s;s and felicity.</P>
<P>Upon which con&s;iderations the States General were &s;o extremely &s;urprized at the news of what pa&s;t lately between the two Naval Armies, and at the mutual jealou&s;ie the two Nations have conceived thereupon, That they thought it mo&s;t highly important, to depute me extraordinari|ly

That their High and Mighti|ne&s;&s;es in ca&s;e <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;hould be found to have begun fir&s;t, would not only di&s;own his Conduct, as contrary to their Orders, but would cau&s;e him to be &s;everely puni&s;h'd, but that if on the contrary, <HI>Blake</HI> &s;hould be convinced of having been the Aggre&s;&s;or, the Parliament was likewi&s;e obliged to Cha&s;ti&s;e him; &s;o that by that proceeding it would be known, not only what was the real intention of their High and Mightine&s;&s;es, but an a&s;&s;ured way would thereby be laid open, to pacifie all troubles, after the Example of &s;eve|ral other States and Republicks, who have &s;uc|ce&s;sfully practi&s;ed the like Expedients. That their High and Mightine&s;&s;es never had the lea&s;t thoughts of making any encroachment up|on the Grandure of the Briti&s;h Nation, in any way to Dimini&s;h it, but that after the late un|happy Rencounter, they had given new Orders, that for the future, at the approach of any of
<PB N="48" REF="29"> their Fleets, or Ships of War, the &s;ame honours &s;hould be rendred to the Parliament in the point of the Flag, that had been u&s;ually paid to that Nation during the preceeding Reigns, hoping by that means, both Parties would have rea&s;on to re&s;t &s;atisfied; that the Treaty of Al|liance about which, the States Amba&s;&s;adors had declared the intention of their Mrs. in &s;everal Conferences, might be at length continued and that it would plea&s;e the Council likewi&s;e to de|clare their intention that the differences being once known, the ob&s;tacles that hindred an ac|commodation might be removed, and a happy conclu&s;ion of an Eternal Alliance and inviolable Friend&s;hip might be obtained; that an end might be put to all Acts of Ho&s;tility, and a Re&s;titution be made of all the Ships and effects belonging to per&s;ons that were Innocent in the matter. That for that end, he prayed the Council to be plea&s;ed to declare their Re&s;olu|tion concerning the points abovementioned, and principally concerning the continuation of the Treaty that was begun, the Ce&s;&s;ation of Ho|&s;tilities, and the Relea&s;ing of the Ships and Per|&s;ons &s;eized, and &s;o much the rather becau&s;e they had not delayed a moment to inform the Coun|cil of State of the good intentions of their High and Mightine&s;&s;es.</Q></P>

<P>On the 29th. the Council of State having ex|amined all the&s;e Rea&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Coun|cil of States An&s;wer.</NOTE> gave the following an|&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Heem&s;ted,</HI> viz. <HI>That he might well enough &s;ee what was the intention of the Parlia|ment, by the an&s;wer given to the three Memori|als of the other Amba&s;&s;adors, before his arrival, &s;ince nothing had been propo&s;ed &s;ince, neither by him nor any other, that was capable to make the Parliament change their Re&s;olution; that if the attempt made by the</HI> Holland <HI>Fleet, as much by &s;urprize as it was had &s;ucceeded according to their hopes, it might have been &s;aid, that the Common|wealth of</HI> England <HI>would have &s;een it &s;elf plung|ed into the greate&s;t di&s;a&s;ters imaginable, and that therefore it was not rea&s;onable, after they had been &s;o miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved, they &s;hould expo&s;e them|&s;elves again to the like di&s;graces for the future. That they could not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be any longer amu&s;ed under the &s;pecious pretence of an Ex|amen, or by Examples not pertinent to their Ca&s;e,

<P>Mr. <HI>de Heem&s;ted</HI> having received this An&s;wer, demanded on the 1&s;t. of <HI>July</HI> a new Conference, in which he Renewed his in&s;tances, by declaring, <HI>That there never had pa&s;t any thing on the States &s;ide that was capable to give any ju&s;t cau&s;e of jea|lou&s;ie to the</HI> Engli&s;h; <HI>That they had propo&s;ed an a&s;&s;ured way, to prevent all &s;orts of Contestation, and to di&s;cover the truth, but that they would not follow it, and that a Manifest inju&s;tice was done to his Mrs. That it was very ea&s;ie to Judge of that by the refu&s;al the States had made to their Subjects, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations u&s;ed by them for that purpo&s;e, to grant them any Letters of Repri&s;al; that la&s;tly to &s;hew, they were wholly inclined to Peace, they had promi&s;ed their Protection to the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Company at</HI> Rotterdam; <HI>that if the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>per&s;i&s;ted to Reject all the fa|vourable means to procure an Accommodation, it would cau&s;e a great Con&s;ternation among&s;t the peo|ple of</HI> Holland; <HI>That in fine, he therefore pray|ed the Council of State, to be plea&s;ed to propo&s;e &s;ome other means them&s;elues, and in the mean while, to forbid all Acts of Ho&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, and to Relea&s;e the Ships that had been taken.</HI></P>

<P>The Parliament could no longer Recoil,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Articles propo&s;ed to the <HI>Dutch</HI> by the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> but at la&s;t propo&s;ed the following Articles as a ground for the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Peace: <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of the States being a&s;toni&s;h'd at &s;uch an an&s;wer, demanded on the 6th. of <HI>July</HI> a new Conference, wherein he Repre&s;ented, <HI>That their High and Mightine&s;&s;es had been obliged to make an Extroardinary armament, and to be at Exce&s;&s;ive Expences for the Rea&s;ons he had already mentioned; that their Subjects had &s;uffered con&s;iderable damages by the taking of a great many</HI> Holland <HI>and</HI> French <HI>Ships; that the States
<PB N="52" REF="31"> and their Merchant Subjects &s;till felt the lo&s;&s;es that had been cau&s;ed to them, that if they would needs &s;tand upon the point of indemnifying, they needed only to compare the lo&s;&s;es of the one Nation with tho&s;e of the other, to be convinced, that the States General had been the greate&s;t &s;ufferers, which would be ea&s;y to demon&s;trate, provided the bu&s;ine&s;s were not &s;pun out to too great a length, by an over Cap|tious di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; That if the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners would on their &s;ide make a ju&s;t and Rea&s;onable e&s;ti|mation, It would then plainly appear, that the true in|tention of their High and Mightine&s;&s;es is to ter|minate things by an amicable way.

<P>The Republick of <HI>England</HI> fortifying every day more and more their Authority, began to render them&s;elves in&s;upportable, by their exce&s;&s;ive Pride and Haughtine&s;s.

<PB N="57" REF="33"> the following Di&s;cour&s;e, in the name of them all.</P>
<Q><P>The States General of the United Provinces have &s;ent their Amba&s;&s;adors Extraordinary to the Parliament of the Republick of <HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI>de Heem&s;ted</HI>'s Speech at his Audi|ence of Leave.</NOTE> to en|deavour by all &s;orts of ways to induce them to renew the ancient Amity between the two Na|tions, and to confirm more &s;traitly their Alli|ance. They were followed a little while after by Mr. <HI>Nieuport</HI> a Member of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>We&s;tfrie&s;land</HI> who was &s;ent to clear &s;ome diffi|culties, and to give a more Authentick proof of their Good Intentions concerning the Treaty of Confederacy.</P>
<P>In fine, it plea&s;ed their High and Mightine&s;&s;es &s;ome days after, to make yet another Extraor|dinary Deputation, and to make choice of me for that, with Expre&s;s Order to come and give the Republick of <HI>England,</HI> new, more particu|lar and &s;tronger A&s;&s;urances of a faithfull and &s;in|cere Amity, in order to di&s;pel all Umbrages and all Subjects of mi&s;under&s;tanding, and to prevent all Ob&s;tacles that might hinder the Execution of &s;o laudable a De&s;ign.</P>
<P>For that effect, it was propo&s;ed. That an en|quiry &s;hould be made by &s;ome judicious per&s;ons on both &s;ides, into the Action that lately pa&s;&s;ed between the two Fleets, and which happened not by any premeditated de&s;ign, but by pure acci|dent, that &s;o according to their Verdict, &s;atis|faction might be given to the Party offended. For we Prote&s;t before God, and before Men, and in pre&s;ence of the Parliament of the Repub|lick of <HI>England,</HI> That the States our Ma&s;ters never had it in their thoughts, to offend this Republick, and much le&s;s to commit any act of Ho&s;tility again&s;t it. But that they were more di&s;po&s;ed by a &s;ence of a true and &s;incere affection, to contribute to the maintaining a &s;table and
<PB N="58" REF="34"> good under&s;tanding and inviolable Peace between them.</P>
<P>But &s;ince unfortunately in &s;pite of the &s;teps that have been made, and the pains taken, to pacifie all the&s;e Troubles, the two Amba&s;&s;ages have proved ineffectual, and fru&s;trated of the hopes they had with &s;o much ju&s;tice conceived, and that, by new Di&s;putes that have ari&s;en and cau&s;ed great lo&s;&s;es; and that be&s;ides, the States are threatned with new Ho&s;tilities from the Par|liaments Fleet, without having had the lea&s;t no|tice given them of it: The Amba&s;&s;adors thought them&s;elves obliged in prudence to prevent the Storm, and to retire into their own Country, as well to go and give an account of their Ne|gotiations, as to take new In&s;tructions from the States their Ma&s;ters. For this end, we pre&s;ent our &s;elves all together before this Augu&s;t A&s;&s;em|bly to give them notice, That we have received order to retire, and are upon the point of our departure.</P>
<P>We have already repre&s;ented to the Council of State what things are nece&s;&s;ary for our departure, with Re&s;pect to the Juncture of time and our Character, and we wait their An&s;wer.</P>
<P>In the mean while, it is not only our Duty but a point of Ju&s;tice to intreat you, that all our Ships that have been brought into the Ports of <HI>England,</HI> or been &s;topt there before the publica|tion of any Declaration of War, without any offence given by any of the Ma&s;ters of the &s;aid Ships, may at la&s;t be relea&s;ed with all their Men, that they may pur&s;ue their intended Voyages, without being mole&s;ted in any manner what&s;oe|ver; and that all be done according to our ancient Friend&s;hip, and the Law of Nations practi&s;ed among Chri&s;tians. We hope the Ju&s;tice of the Soveraign Republick of <HI>England</HI> will not refu&s;e us a demand &s;o equitable as this.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="34">
<P>Moreover, we Implore the Protection of Heaven, and be&s;eech God, the Author of Peace, that he will plea&s;e of his Goodne&s;s to in&s;pire the Par|liament of this Republick with &s;uch Sentiments as may induce them to a Speedy Reconciliation with the States of the United Provinces, for the maintenance of the Reformation who&s;e firme&s;t &s;up|port, and mo&s;t &s;olid foundation has always been Peace, in the Bo&s;om of which it Flouri&s;hes, and quietly enjoys Pro&s;perity, and which, on the con|trary, if our Troubles &s;hould continue any longer, would &s;ee it &s;elf brought to an inevitable De|&s;truction, and plunged into the greate&s;t Mi&s;e|ries. We &s;till pray God to be plea&s;ed to avert the Cour&s;e of the Mi&s;chiefs and Calamities that accompany War; and to pour forth his precious Ble&s;&s;ings upon the two Republicks.</P>
<P>And as we are ordered to retire forthwith into <HI>Holland,</HI> we &s;hall accordingly take leave of this Illu&s;trious A&s;&s;embly, with all imaginable thanks for the kindne&s;&s;es we have received from them, in full confidence, that they will not refu&s;e us the things we have already demanded of them, and which are every where granted to Amba&s;|&s;adors, in regard to their Character, for the &s;e|curity of their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, we recommend to you the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mer|chants re&s;iding at <HI>London,</HI> or el&s;ewhere within this Kingdom, that their Goods and Per&s;ons may be taken into the Protection of the Parliament.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e were the &s;teps made by the States Gene|neral of the United Provinces, to prevent a Rup|ture with <HI>England,</HI> by which, all the world may judge, how great the Power of that new hatcht State was, tho &s;carcely yet fledg'd, to make them &s;o Courted by a Nation that at that juncture, more fear'd than lov'd them, and how great and pre&s;umptuous their pride was too, in refu&s;ing &s;uch fair offers and venturing to engage in a

<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had already &s;eized upon the I&s;le of <HI>In&s;eith,</HI> where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> u&s;ed to water, and the&s;e, latter advancing towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> arrived near <HI>Fulo</HI> and <HI>Fairhill,</HI> where they e&s;pi|ed <HI>Blake,</HI> who was watching for our Ships com|ing back from the <HI>Indies.</HI> The two Fleets were di&s;po&s;ing them&s;elves for a Fight, when in the night between the 5th and 6th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Skie grew dark by little and little, and &s;oon after there appear|ed certain pre&s;ages of a violent Tempe&s;t:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI> di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a dreadful Tempe&s;t.</NOTE> For the wind having long been &s;hifting about, turned at la&s;t to the <HI>N.

Thus the Fleet being as 'twere buried by the violence of the Sea, in mo&s;t horrible Aby&s;&s;es, ro&s;e out of them only to be to&s;t up to the very Clouds. Here the Ma&s;ts were beaten down into the Sea, there the Deck was over-flown by the prevailing Waves: Here the Tempe&s;t was &s;o much Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Ships, that they could be no longer governed, and on another &s;ide, ap|peared all the doleful fore-runners of a di&s;mal Wrack. And the Darkne&s;s increa&s;ing the danger, and the confu&s;ed cries of the Mariners redoub|ling the common fear, both together made the &s;adde&s;t and mo&s;t frightful &s;pectacle, that was e|ver &s;een.</P>
<P>When the day was come, the di&s;order was clearly di&s;covered: Two Ships were found ram|ed in between two Rocks, and the Shattered Re|licks of three Fire&s;hips, that were &s;eparated from the Fleet by the violence of the Waves, left no
<PB N="63" REF="36"> manner of Room to doubt of their being lo&s;t.

In the mean while <HI>Tromp</HI> went before, &s;ailing to|wards, the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> with a Fleet of 39 &s;ail, and one of the Ships come from the <HI>Indies;</HI> And in the Latitude of <HI>Scotland,</HI> he di&s;covered <HI>Blake</HI> with 62 Great Ships much le&s;s damaged then his own, becau&s;e that by a great happine&s;s for him, the Tempe&s;t having driven him to the North|ward of <HI>Hitland,</HI> he found on that &s;ide, more Shelter, as &s;oon as <HI>Tromp</HI> e&s;pied him, he di&s;|po&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;tay for his coming up to him, with intention to pre&s;ent him battle. But <HI>Blake</HI> either being loath to lo&s;e the Weather-Gage, or for &s;ome other Rea&s;ons unknown, would not ac|cept it. Soon after, ob&s;erving that <HI>Tromp</HI> was &s;heer'd off into the main Sea, in order to pur|&s;ue his fir&s;t intended cour&s;e, he likewi&s;e fell down towards the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> having done nothing with his &s;o potent Fleet, but &s;cattered the Herring Fi&s;h|ers, de&s;troyed their Convoy, and taken two <HI>Zea|land</HI> Ships that were cruizing in tho&s;e Seas, and which fell by chance into his Fleet, but who had fir&s;t de&s;troyed him two of his Frigats. The re&s;t of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet after they had &s;pent &s;ome weeks in refitting, entred happily into the <HI>Vlie</HI> and the <HI>Texel</HI> at the beginning of <HI>September.</HI> Whil&s;t <HI>Tromp</HI> was out at Sea, the States General re&s;olv|ed to &s;et out another Fleet, be&s;ides, both to &s;e|cure their Merchant Ships, render Navigation more Free, and put them&s;elves into a Condition the more powerfully to oppo&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> This Re|&s;olution taken, they were next to &s;eek for a Man

But they pre&s;&s;ed it to him again, telling him, that &s;uch a man as he, that had given &s;o many Sig|nal proofs of his Bravery, and of his Zeal for his Country, ought not now to refu&s;e at a dead lift, to give it the la&s;t marks of his &s;tedfa&s;t affection that were de&s;ired of him, e&s;pecially &s;ince, he would be only obliged to go as 'twere a ro|ving. So that at la&s;t he let him&s;elf be per&s;wa|ded, and went on Board the Ship called the <HI>Nep|tune,</HI> carrying 28 Guns, and 134 Men. But the Fleet that was to a&s;&s;emble at <HI>Wielingen,</HI> was forced to &s;tay &s;ome time for &s;everal Men of War which were at the <HI>Texel,</HI> and other Ports. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> being embark'd on board the <HI>Neptune,</HI> put to Sea, and arrived on the 10th. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at the Fleet which was then but 15 &s;ail of Men of War, and 2 Fire-&s;hips. Some days after ha|ving received a Reinforcement of 7 men of War and 2 Fire-&s;hips, he &s;et &s;ail towards the Strait of <HI>Callis,</HI> according to the Order he had recei|ved from the States for that effect. His Com|mi&s;&s;ion was, to Convoy along the Channel the Merchant Fleet that was then in the <HI>Texel,</HI> rea|dy to &s;et &s;ail to the We&s;t-ward, and afterwards to Cruize about the Channel to pick up the Ships that were coming from divers parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and Conduct them into <HI>Holland.</HI> For that purpo&s;e Order was likewi&s;e given to the Merchant Fleet in the <HI>Texel,</HI> to &s;peed away to <HI>Wielingen,</HI> to en|deavour

For there were two of them of 60 Guns each, and 8 from 36 to 40, and be&s;ides them 5 Fire&s;hips. <HI>De Ruiter</HI>'s Forces con&s;i&s;ted of 30 &s;mall Ships of War, and 6 Fire-&s;hips. The greate&s;t of tho&s;e Ships had not on board above 30 Guns, excepting 2 of them, namly the <HI>Peace,</HI> and the <HI>O&s;tritch</HI> that carried each of them 40, and that were Equiped by the care of the <HI>Indian</HI> Chamber of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> for the Service of the State; and the others had not half their Com|pliment of Men; be&s;ides which di&s;advantage, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> was hampered with a Merchant Fleet of 60 &s;ail, who were the principal mark at which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> levelled their de&s;igns.

<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> lo&s;s, according to their own report, was &s;o very &s;mall, that 'tis hardly to be believed, they having lo&s;t none of their Ships, and having had but 50 or 60 men kill'd, and about as many wounded; whereas on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ide, it is pretended according to the mo&s;t faithfull ac|count, there were above a 1000 kill'd or woun|ded, and two or three of their Ships lo&s;t.</P>

<Q>The day following <HI>de Ruiter</HI> calling together all the Officers of the Fleet, told them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Ruiter</HI> propo&s;es to go and attack the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in their own Harbours.</NOTE> it was certain, that Admiral <HI>Ay&s;chew</HI> was retired with his Fleet to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> after the Fight, to repair his damages there; and that for his part, he was of the mind, that 'twere be&s;t to go and attack him there, whil&s;t he dreamt of nothing le&s;s than that, and whil&s;t mo&s;t of the Captains of his Fleet might be perhaps a &s;hore to refre&s;h them&s;elves; that he flattered him&s;elf by the Divine protecti|on, to be able totally to de&s;troy them, before they &s;hould be in a condition to come them&s;elves and attack him with fre&s;h Forces; that the la&s;t Fight &s;ufficiently &s;hewed their &s;mall courage, and their weakne&s;s, and that therefore it was ea&s;y to Judge from thence, that if they were attackt now whil&s;t they were &s;till in that di&s;order and con&s;ternation, they might be entirely defeated without any great trouble; that they had Tri|umphed over them even whil&s;t they had yet a Mer|chant Fleet of 60 &s;ail to guard, tho' they were much &s;uperiour to them in &s;trength, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> had the Weather-gage, not to mention the Cowardice of &s;everal <HI>Holland</HI> Captains that were wanting in their duty; That tho&s;e who were in the Num|ber

<P>All the Officers applauded this Speech of <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> and it was concluded in the Councel, to put this re&s;olve in Execution with all the Expe|dition imaginable. But when they were ju&s;t go|ing to attempt it, the night before, which was on the 30th. of the Month, the Wind changed to the South South Ea&s;t, and turned afterwards quite to the South. And then the Fleet was got within two miles of <HI>Good&s;tart,</HI> and was driven &s;o fierce|ly by the Wind that they were forc'd to quit that project, <HI>De Ruiter</HI> by Cruizing before <HI>Good|&s;tart,</HI> had alarmed all tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, and con&s;train|ed <HI>Ay&s;chew</HI> with all his Fleet to &s;hut them&s;elves up in their Harbours.

<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e di&s;advantages, Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> was &s;till ob&s;tinately bent to at|tack the <HI>English,</HI> and was for that purpo&s;e, ma|king towards them, when perceiving, that he &s;hould be but very &s;lenderly back'd, he made a &s;top, In the mean while the Weather falling to a Calm, <HI>de Wit</HI> call'd together all the Gene|ral and Under Officers of his Fleet to a Coun|cil of War, to deliberate about the pre&s;ent State of affairs. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> and <HI>Evertz</HI> that were in joint Command with him, maintain'd, that 'twas a great Ra&s;hne&s;s, to expo&s;e the Fleet to &s;o immi|nent a danger; becau&s;e their Ships were &s;o much &s;cattered one from the other, that it would be four a Clock in the afternoon, before the for|warde&s;t, and Dusk of night before the backwar|de&s;t of them could come up with the body of the Enemies Fleet; that the <HI>English</HI> had received a con&s;iderable Reinforcement, whereas the <HI>Holland|ers</HI> on the contrary were grown weaker. That the former had a great advantage by their Fire-Ships, whereas they could make no u&s;e of theirs; that their Fleet was very ill manned, and a great many of their men &s;ick and wounded, that two of their Ships had lo&s;t their Fore-Ma&s;ts, that the Main-Ma&s;t of the Ship call'd the <HI>Prince William,</HI> was quite di&s;abled, and many other Ships much endamaged; and in fine, that there would be no manner of tolerable rea&s;on to be alledged in ex|cu&s;e of &s;o great a fault as it would be at that time, to put the States and the Government in imminent danger of ruin, by &s;o ra&s;hly expo&s;ing their Fleet. All the&s;e rea&s;ons were too evident to be rejected; and therefore they tackt a|bout
<PB N="80" REF="45"> to get away from the Enemies, only 7 Ships that were kept back by a contrary Wind, were forced to lag behind, and endure the Force of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral and his Squadron who had the Weather-gage of them, till the Dusk of Night, hut without any great damage. The <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tch</HI> Fleet then having thus made a Retreat under the favour|able covert of the Darkne&s;s, Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> who affected to &s;hew courage out of &s;ea&s;on, cal|led another Council of War, and propo&s;ed, that the Fleet &s;hould keep to the leeward, but all the Officers &s;melling out his de&s;ign, Unanimou&s;|ly maintained, that it 'twas not at all advi&s;able to &s;tand another attack from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> becau&s;e they were too weak to cope with them, and it would he too great a hazard to venture it, but that it would be much &s;afer to Retreat with all the &s;ail they could, towards <HI>Goree,</HI> to recruit them&s;elves, and to wait the Orders of the States.</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible for <HI>de Wit,</HI> to oppo&s;e that Re&s;olution, and &s;o much the more becau&s;e he plainly perceived, that many of his Captains were re&s;olved to lie &s;till, and be bare &s;pectatours of a Fight to which they were no ways con&s;enting, and that of all the whole Fleet there were but 15 Ships that he could tru&s;t upon, &s;o &s;u&s;picious to him was the fidelity of all the re&s;t, &s;o that there was no other way le&s;t for him to take, but to make as fa&s;t as he could from the Enemy, which at la&s;t, tho' much again&s;t his &s;tomach, that Bully-Admiral was fain to re&s;olve upon; yet terribly fretted he was, to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;o de&s;erted at a time when his fooli&s;h Ambition flattered him, that he might have gained immortal Glory to him&s;elf and a great Triumph for his Country.

The next morn|ing at break of day, the <HI>English</HI> were &s;een to come on again to charge them. Upon which, <HI>Tromp</HI> having put all things in order for that purpo&s;e advanced towards the Enemies Fleet, with more Courage and Re&s;olution than any Forces he had to fight them. For at mo&s;t he had but one poor Squadron under his Flag that had

At 10 of the Clock in the morning, the two Fleets came up with one ano|ther, and commenced a third Battle, which was very ob&s;tinate and Bloody, yet without any great advantage to the Enemies. The Engli&s;h Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Blew</HI> Braved for &s;ome time the Dutch Admiral, thundring continually at him with his Guns, but he forbearing to fire till he came up almo&s;t clo&s;e to his &s;ide, gave him then fir&s;t one Broad-&s;ide, and after that another, &s;o much to the purpo&s;e, that he was forc'd to retire.

God be prai&s;ed, that he has been plea&s;ed to honour his children with his Protection, by di&s;arming their Enemies. Ever &s;ince the <HI>10th</HI> of this month, he
<PB N="100" REF="55"> hath given us a&s;&s;ured pre&s;ages of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, by &s;ending us favourable winds. Our Fleet was right again&s;t <HI>Portland,</HI> and much perplext for fear the Enemy upon &s;ight of us, &s;hould have made away farther from us. Two days before, we were at Prayers, and on the <HI>18th,</HI> we perceived, that God was going to inform us, where they were. The Text that day was taken out of the <HI>2 Chron. 20.16.</HI> in the&s;e words. <HI>To morrow go ye down a|gain&s;t them,</HI> &amp;c. And the Chapter was &s;carce|ly expounded, but even before break of day, we di&s;covered the Enemies Fleet; upon which, we immediately &s;et Sail, to make to them, and the Enemy did the &s;ame by us, and &s;carcely were the two adver&s;e Fleets met, but they engaged in a Battle. We had at fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t the di&s;advantage, be|cau&s;e the Enemies had the weather-gage, and that the major part of our be&s;t Ships could not come up to us.

But more could not be expected from them than it plea&s;ed God they &s;hould do,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> and which our Enemies doubtle&s;s have &s;ufficiently experienced. The fir&s;t day we took from them three Rear-Admirals, and one Vice-Admiral, and a little after, we &s;unk them <HI>3</HI> Ships; the others are now at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> The <HI>2d</HI> day we burnt or &s;unk <HI>8</HI> or <HI>10</HI> more of them; The <HI>3d</HI> day, they began to give way, and betake them&s;elves to flight. Their lo&s;&s;es are &s;o much the greater and more &s;en&s;ible, in that we took from them above <HI>40</HI> men of War and Merchant Ships. We Boarded them in the &s;ight of <HI>Tromp,</HI> he not being able to oppo&s;e us. Captain <HI>Law&s;on</HI> Grappled a great Ship and took her, but he was very much battred. <HI>Marten</HI> and
<PB N="101" REF="55"> <HI>Gaver</HI> took al&s;o two Ships, &s;o that we have taken &s;everal, and our Enemies will be forced to own their lo&s;s to be great.

Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> was wounded in the Thigh, but we hope he will not be much incommoded by it. He would hardly be per&s;waded to go down into the Ship, to be dre&s;t, and never quitted his Po&s;t during the whole fight. In fine, we ob&s;erved, that every day as long as the Battle la&s;ted, the Arm of the Al|mighty God favoured our Arms, being bound to acknowledge, That 'tis he that gives the Victory, and not the great number of Ships, or the &s;trength of Armies.</P></Q>
<P>This Letter &s;eemed very edifying by the great &s;hew of Piety that appeared throughout it, but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that this was the &s;tile of the Engli&s;h in <HI>Cromwel</HI>'s time, that able Politi|cian covering him&s;elf u&s;ually with the Cloak of Religion to make his Ambitious Projects take effect, and the way to make a mans Court with him, was to affect a great &s;hew of Devoti|on.

<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighty Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Battle that has la&s;ted <HI>3</HI> days together be|gun the la&s;t of <HI>February</HI> at <HI>9</HI> a Clock in the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI>'s Letter to the States about the &s;ame fight.</NOTE> and ended not till the 2d. of <HI>March,</HI> when the Night parted the Combatants. It was, given in that extent of Sea that is between <HI>Port|land,</HI> and <HI>Swartne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Bullen.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had about <HI>69</HI> or <HI>70</HI> &s;ail of Frigats and Men of War, and we <HI>70</HI> Men of War, and <HI>150</HI> Merchant Ships. I cannot yet give your High and Mightine&s;&s;es all the particulars, becau&s;e most of the Captains hardly had time the 1&s;t. of <HI>March,</HI> to come on board the Admiral.</P>
<P>They have informed me, that <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squa|dron which fell upon the Enemies Rear, took &s;ome Ships from them, whil&s;t &s;everal others on both &s;ides, were &s;unk. As for our Van guard of which I had the joynt Conduct with Rear Admiral <HI>Flori&s;z,</HI> we at|tackt that of the Enemies under the Command of <HI>Blake.</HI> The fight was fierce and ob&s;tinate, and the Victory very wavering, &s;o that neither of the Parties had any cau&s;e to brag of any advantage they had. This was the &s;ucce&s;s of the fir&s;t days fight. About <HI>4</HI> a Clock in the afternoon ob&s;erving that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had detacht a Squadron of their nimble&s;t Sailors, to go and fall upon the Merchant Fleet, with de&s;ign to burn them, we quitted the Fight, to ha&s;ten to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. After the Acti|on was over, I &s;ent for the General Officers of the Fleet, <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> and <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> on board the Ad|miral, whil&s;t <HI>Flori&s;z</HI> was left to take care tho&s;e Ships of the Fleet should be repaired that had need of it. We therefore con&s;ulted upon the pre&s;ent State of Affairs, whether it would be advi&s;able for us to leave our Merchant Ships to their shifts, to
<PB N="103" REF="57"> go and attackt the Enemies once more, &s;ince we were to weak to &s;pare a detachment of Men of War &s;trong enough to Convoy them; and be&s;ides that we had &s;ome grounds to fear, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> might have &s;till &s;ome body of re&s;erve towards <HI>Cal|lis,</HI> or whether it would not be better, to defend them, by making them keep clo&s;e by us, and &s;o in a fighting po&s;ture to wait the Enem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es charge. And becau&s;e we were in want of Powder, order was given to husband it well, and not to make one shot unprofitably. We di&s;covered to the Ea&s;t-ward at a good distance from us, the Ship called the <HI>O&s;tritch</HI> &s;o terribly battered and di&s;abled, that she had nothing left but her Main, and Miz|zen Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ls, whereupon, I ordered <HI>de Wilde</HI> to go and take her, and bring her to the Fleet. As &s;oon as we had got together all our Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ps both Men of War and Merchants, we stood to the North-We&s;t, and towards evening we had a great Calm. But <HI>de Wilde</HI> not being able to bring off the <HI>O&s;t|ritch,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> carried her away next day to their Fleet.</P>
<P>That day about <HI>11</HI> a Clock, the Enemies came and charged us again. They had po&s;ted in the Wings of their Fleet, five or &s;ix of their best Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ps, to Endeavour to intercept &s;ome of our Ships. We fought all that day till the Dusk of N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ght.

Towards evening &s;everal Captains came and Complain'd, that they had no Ammunition left, upon which, becau&s;e I had on board the Admiral a great many Bullets, <HI>8</HI> pound|ers, I distributed them among&s;t tho&s;e, who had Guns of that Bore. We &s;till pur&s;ued our Cour&s;e the Wind at We&s;t-North-We&s;t, and every one en|deavoured to repair their re&s;pective Ships as well as it was po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<PB N="104" REF="58">
<P>On the 2d. of <HI>March,</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> attackt us a|gain with a great deal of vigour; and we had hard|ly fought two hours, but half of our Ships had &s;pent all their Ammunition. we fired &s;ome guns for a &s;ignal to them to come on board us, which they did. I placed them in the main body of the Fleet, and charged them to make &s;hew as if they wanted nothing, telling them, that they which &s;till had a|ny Ammunition, &s;hould take care to defend them; &s;o that I made a &s;hift to maintain the fight till night, defending them all that while with not a|bove <HI>25</HI> or <HI>30</HI> Ships that were &s;till provided with Powder and Bullets. Two hours after, <HI>Blake</HI> ha|ving a&s;&s;embled all his Forces, made &s;hew as if he would fall upon us once more. When I &s;aw that, I took in my Sails, and let him know, I was rea|dy to begin again with him; upon which, after the Vanguards of the two Fleets had charged one ano|ther for &s;ome time, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at length &s;heer'd off, to Sea ward, and <HI>Blake</HI> being out of Cannon &s;hot, came no more at us. Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> coming then to me, told me, they wanted Powder and Bullets. When night was come, we hang out Lantherns, continuing all the while our former Cour&s;e with a North North Ea&s;t Wind. <HI>Blake</HI> likewi&s;e hung out his Lanthenrs, being to the Lee|ward. Towards mid-night, we lo&s;t &s;ight of the E|nemies lights; and the next morning we perceived <HI>Callis</HI> bearing South-We&s;t of us at about <HI>2</HI> miles d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tance, without &s;eeing any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at all.

<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this Battle made &s;o great a noi&s;e at <HI>London,</HI> that they made no difficulty to pub|li&s;h abroad that <HI>Tromp, Evert&s;z,</HI> and <HI>de Ruiter</HI> were totally Routed, and that 100 Merchant Ships, and 50 Men of War of the <HI>Dutch</HI> were taken or &s;unk; nay, and this noi&s;e was Echoed over all <HI>Europe;</HI> and was carried into <HI>France, Sweedland, Denmark,</HI> and to render what they affected to

<P>Yet his di&s;content was &s;o much the better grounded, becau&s;e he was obliged to put to Sea, with a great Number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els ill provided for War, accompanied with a great many Co|wardly and unexperienc'd Officers, whereby it was to be con&s;idered, he mu&s;t needs not only expo&s;e his life, but likewi&s;e that great Reputa|tion he had gotten by &s;o many brave Exploits. But time would not then permit the States to Re|dre&s;s &s;o many grievances at once. 'Tis True, that at the in&s;tances made by the States of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> a Re&s;olution was taken to build 30 new men of War of &s;ufficient bigne&s;s to with&s;tand the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but that was a work required time; and in the mean while, <HI>Tromp</HI> was fain to make &s;hift with tho&s;e &s;orry ones he had already, for want of better, which at that Juncture were not to be had.</P>

<P>The Orders he had from the States General, imported, that he &s;hould Convoy towards the North of <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Fleet of 200 Merchant Ships bound for <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and &s;hould Con|duct back tho&s;e other Ships that &s;hould be ar|rived in that Sea from divers places.</P>

<P>On Wit&s;unday, <HI>Tromp</HI> had a Conference with three Deputies of the States General: The Re|&s;ult of their Con&s;ultation, was that <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;hould make towards the <HI>Downs</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in hopes to meet there with &s;ome of the Parliaments Ships. On the 4th. of <HI>June</HI> they di&s;covered &s;ome of them to the Northward, upon which holding a Council of War, it was re&s;olved that <HI>de Ruiter</HI> with his Squadron joyntly with Rear-Admiral <HI>Flori&s;z,</HI> &s;hould &s;teer to the Southward, whil&s;t <HI>Tromp</HI> with Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> &s;hould move to the North|ward, that &s;o by &s;hutting up the Enemies Squa|drons within the <HI>Downs,</HI> they might attack them with the greater effect. But the <HI>English,</HI> e&s;peci|ally <HI>Bodley,</HI> who was returned with a Squa|dron of 8 men of War, and 8 Merchant Ships, from the Mediteranean, were come to an Anchor under the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Downs,</HI> of which <HI>Tromp</HI> had had advice; <HI>Bodley</HI> to e&s;cape him, had re|moved to the We&s;tward, &s;o that Admiral <HI>Flori&s;z</HI> coming thither fir&s;t, found no more but two lit|tle Ships that were retired under the Cannon of the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Dover,</HI> and the <HI>Downs,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> begun then to Cannonade them briskly, to which they returned as vigorou&s;ly; But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at length getting nearer <HI>Dover,</HI> found in that road 5 &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, of which three were taken, tho' they had at the very fir&s;t &s;ight of our Ships, cut their Cables, to e&s;cape, the fourth fled, and the fifth which was a Frigat retired quite under the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<PB N="123" REF="67">
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fired mo&s;t terribly from the Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Dover</HI> upon the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> but <HI>Tromp</HI> an&s;wered them &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that all the Inha|bitants of the Country were alarmed at it, know|ing not where to flie, and dur&s;t not &s;tay in their Hou&s;es which they &s;aw unroofed by the <HI>Holland|ers</HI> Cannon balls.</P>
<P>After that Expedition, <HI>Tromp</HI> advanced to|wards <HI>Swartne&s;s,</HI> where being informed, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet had appeared near the <HI>&V;lie,</HI> he thereupon re&s;olved to go in &s;earch of them, and on the 24th. having di&s;covered them over again&s;t <HI>Newport,</HI> he made up directly to them. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was then compo&s;ed of 98 men of War, but all of them much &s;maller, and nothing near &s;o well provided for War, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The Wind was North-Ea&s;t, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had the Weather-gage. The two Fleets having re|mained &s;ome time in pre&s;ence of one another, without any offer made by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to attack the <HI>Hollanders, Tromp</HI> did all he could by Luf|fing to get up to them; when he came nigh them, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> began at length to ca&s;t their Fleet into a line of Battle, and divided it into three Squadrons. They at fir&s;t made a Motion with de&s;ign to enclo&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> within a Cre|&s;cent, but when they &s;aw the others ob&s;erve them very narrowly, and &s;eem re&s;olved to &s;tand them, their Squadrons joyned again, and advanced with|in Cannon &s;hot of their Enemy; and then <HI>Monk</HI> and <HI>Dean</HI> gave the &s;ignal for Battle and &s;o the two Fleets engaged about 11 a Clock before noon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A cruel fight be|tween <HI>Tromp</HI> and the Admi|rals <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Monk.</HI></NOTE></P>

The fight was furious, and bloody, particularly be|tween <HI>Law&s;on</HI>'s and <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadrons; For this latter fought with &s;uch Courage and ob&s;ti|nate eagerne&s;s, that he con&s;umed mo&s;t part of his Powder, then <HI>Tromp</HI> came into his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which <HI>Monk</HI> perceiving, he advanced with his main &s;trength, and fell upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral, which redoubled the fury of the Fight, and the Courage of the Combatants.</P>
<P><HI>Law&s;on</HI> at the head of 9 or 10 Frigats, advanc'd with intent to intercept the Captains <HI>Vander Zaan,</HI> and <HI>Joo&s;t Bulter,</HI> of <HI>Groningen,</HI> who made great re&s;i&s;tance, but at length <HI>Bulter</HI>'s Ship, cal|led the <HI>Camel,</HI> having received 4 or 5 &s;hot be|tween Wind and Water, was forced to yield, and pre&s;ently after &s;unk: <HI>Bulter</HI> who was wounded in the middle of his Body with a &s;plin|ter, died with his drawn hanger in his hand, and was &s;wallowed up half dead by the Waves with part of his wounded men; the re&s;t of the Ships crew &s;aved them&s;elves on board <HI>Vander Zaan,</HI> who ran great hazard of being involv'd in the &s;ame misfortune as <HI>Bulter,</HI> being likewi&s;e &s;urrounded by the Enemies, but at la&s;t he made his way through them by &s;inking one of their Ships. <HI>Tromp</HI> made all imaginable efforts to grapple the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral, but never could get near enough to him. While they were fighting, the wind hapning quite to fall, the <HI>English</HI> White Squadron was by that means &s;eparated from the re&s;t of their Fleet; the <HI>Hollanders</HI> willing to improve that opportunity, advanced with de&s;ign to inter|cept it, whil&s;t the <HI>English</HI> on the other, did all they could, to rejoin their Forces, but before they could effect it, the <HI>Dutch</HI> pre&s;&s;ed clo&s;e up|on the <HI>English</HI> Blue Squadron, and with broad|&s;ides made their way through the <HI>English</HI> Fleet.</P>
<PB N="125" REF="68">
<P>The Victory having a long time Wavered, be|gun then to declare it &s;elf for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who making their Enemies give way, pur&s;ued them, but a great di&s;order hapning in their Fleet, the <HI>English</HI> knew &s;o well to make their advantage of it, that they gained the Weather-gage of them, which gave life to a &s;econd Engagement no le&s;s bloody than the fir&s;t, and which cau&s;ed the de|&s;truction of the mo&s;t part of the Ships that com|po&s;ed both the Fleets. About 9 at night ano|ther <HI>English</HI> Ship was burnt, but they continu|ed &s;till fighting till the night parted them; And then the <HI>English</HI> &s;tood to the Northward, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to the South-ward; but un|fortunately, when the Enemies were already reti|red out of Canon &s;hot, as Captain <HI>Van Velzen</HI> was firing off his la&s;t &s;hot, his Powder took fire, and blew up his Ship with almo&s;t all his Men, hardly 55 e&s;caping of the whole Ships Crew.</P>
<P>The whole night was &s;pent in repairing the damages received in the Battle, and mending up as well as po&s;&s;ible, the Ships that were mo&s;t bat|tered. At break of day, next morning, the two Fleets found them&s;elves not above a mile di&s;tant one from the other. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> put out the u&s;ual &s;ignal to call his Officers on board him, at who&s;e arrival, he with much vexa|tion heard the ill news, that mo&s;t part of the Ships of his Fleet wanted Ammunition, by which they were di&s;abled to &s;tand a &s;econd Battle. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that if <HI>Tromp</HI> had been &s;e|conded as he ought to have been the day before, by &s;ome Captains in his Fleet that failed in their duty, and were fal&s;e to the fidelity they had &s;worn to their Country, the <HI>English</HI> had been &s;o well reduced to rea&s;on, that they would hardly have had any mind to begin a new Battle the next day. Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> had &s;o &s;mall a Quanti|ty of Powder and Bullets left, that it would hardly &s;erve him three hours firing: and <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had le&s;s

<P>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> had done all he could from the fir&s;t appearance of the morning,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;econd Battle fought the 13th. of <HI>June.</HI></NOTE> to tack to the South-Ea&s;t, to be able to get the Weather gage which the Engli&s;h had, that &s;o he might the more &s;ucce&s;sfully force his way into the middle of their Fleet. About 8 a Clock the Van-guards of the two Fleets began to fire at one another at a di&s;tance; but <HI>Tromp</HI> pur|&s;uing his de&s;ign, had already about 10 a Clock got <HI>Dunkirk</HI> at the South-South Ea&s;tward of him, and was in hopes to get up to the main bo|dy of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, and to intercept a good part of their Ships. But they were no &s;ooner en|gaged, but their hapned a Calm, which was the cau&s;e, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> found them&s;elves to the lee-ward, and the <HI>English</HI> had the Weathergage; which opportunity they improving, came Thun|dering about 11 a Clock upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, with &s;o much the greater advantage, becau&s;e <HI>Blake</HI> had reinforced them in the night with a Squadron of 28 great men of War which he had brought from <HI>Port&s;mouth. Tromp</HI> thereby found him&s;elf obliged to clo&s;e up the Rear of his Fleet, to en|deavour as well as 'twas po&s;&s;ible, to &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock of the Enemies. <HI>Tromp, De Wit, De Ruiter,</HI> and &s;ome others fought with an unparal|lel'd bravery; But unhapily from the very beginning of the fight, a di&s;order having hapned in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet for want of Experience in the Officers, they began to give way, and at length were part of them taken, and part &s;unk; nay, the Confu&s;ion was &s;o great among them, that &s;ome of them quitted their Fire-Ships after having &s;et fire to them them&s;elves, who endeavour|ed to palliate their infamous Cowardice, by pre|tending, they had received &s;everal &s;hot between
<PB N="128" REF="70"> Wind and Water. However, tho' the valiant <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;aw him&s;elf thus de&s;erted by his Rear-guard, yet he lo&s;t not his courage for that, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;till the &s;ame pre&s;ence of mind, and being ani|mated by Reflections upon his pa&s;t glory, and by the hopes and unextingui&s;hable pa&s;&s;ion he had, &s;till to maintain it to the la&s;t, grapled Vice-Admiral <HI>Pen,</HI> boarded him, and power-d &s;o many men into his Enemies Ship; that he had already made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of her, when 13 <HI>English</HI> Frigats tacking about upon him, &s;o cruelly hand|led him, that they forced him to let go his hold.</P>
<P>The Enemies likewi&s;e in their turn, grapling afterwards Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> powred in &s;o great a Number of Sea men, on board him that his men were forced to flie all under Deck. Upon which, <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf over powr'd with Numbers, thought there was no other Remedy, but to &s;et fire to &s;ome barrels of Powder, which he did &s;o effectually, that in an In&s;tant as by a clap of Thunder, the Enemies were blown up Pell Mell into the Air, and their bodies were &s;een to flie about half burnt, and rent to pieces. Yet this blow did not &s;o much di&s;courage the <HI>English,</HI> but they came on and charged him afre&s;h; and he had certainly been lo&s;t, had not <HI>de Wit</HI> and <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> e&s;pying the great danger he was in, come up without lo&s;ing time and di&s;engaged him about 7 a Clock in the Evening.</P>
<P>Captain <HI>Schellinger</HI>'s Ship being much battered, and de&s;erted by mo&s;t of her Sea men, fell into the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, and was &s;oon after burnt to A&s;hes. The Ship <HI>We&s;tergoo,</HI> being &s;urrounded, by three <HI>English</HI> men of War, that furiou&s;ly battered her on all &s;ides, was forced to yield ju&s;t when &s;he was ready to &s;ink; a little before that, Captain <HI>Verburg</HI>'s Ship having had her Helm &s;hot away, fell into the Enemies hands, and after a vigo|rous re&s;i&s;tance, was at la&s;t con&s;trained al&s;o to

For Trading was interrup|ted, and the Artificers and Handy-craft People knew not which way to &s;ub&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t any longer. The Town of <HI>Enkui&s;en</HI> had a great hand in all the&s;e Di&s;orders.

<P>The murmurings of the people were ri&s;en to that height, that 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to &s;top them. For they loudly complained, that none of them could tell how to get their living any longer, what Trade &s;oever they took to; That if they had a mind to oppo&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> why did not <HI>Tromp</HI> come back from <HI>Zealand?</HI> Why were not the Ene|mies driven out of the Harbors of the <HI>Texel,</HI> who without controul, took daily from them Ship after Ship, whil&s;t they &s;aw them&s;elves be&s;ieged, and threat|ned with an inevitable Series of Mi&s;chiefs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates of that Town, thinking to put a &s;top to the fatal Con&s;equences of all tho&s;e Di&s;or|ders, would needs have Recour&s;e to force of Arms, and &s;ent for &s;ome Troops which in Boats approacht the Town: But the <HI>Mobb</HI> the more fiercely inra|ged at that, got together in &s;uch multitudes, that they carried all before them, and &s;eized upon the Town-Hou&s;e, the Gates, the Ramparts, and all the Stores of Warlike Amunition. Which done, they put up upon the Towers, the Princes Colours, as de|&s;igning by that, to revenge the &s;light the Govern|m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt had of late put upon his Authority: They

<P>So Bold an example open'd a door to the licen|ciou&s;ne&s;s of other Factious Spirits, which was &s;o much the more dangerous, becau&s;e the Affairs they meddled with, were both Nice and Im|portant.</P>
<P>The War again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> was not heartily undertaken, &s;aid they,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub|ject heads of the peoples com|plaints.</NOTE> and yet the Subjects of the United Provinces were daily more and more impoveri&s;hed thereby.

That if they had Forces, they ought to be employed, to free the Sea from the Yoak of a Power that claim'd to it &s;elf the &s;ole Dominion of it; That they had rea&s;on to fear the wor&s;t that could be imagined from the cruel Inju&s;tice of their Neighbours, if after having lo&s;t &s;o much Blood, they &s;hould fall to &s;o low an ebb of &s;trength as to be unable to re&s;i&s;t the Enemy; That their Merchant Ships were taken in view of the <HI>Texel,</HI> and the Seamen made the Innocent victims of Cruelty; That their Ships were &s;o ill Equipt, that they were not able to re&s;i&s;t the full man|ned, and well appointed Ships of the

<PB N="135" REF="73"> their Government: And that therefore, they could not comprehend for what rea&s;on the lawful heir of that <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> Family was not put into po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the Offices and Dignities which his Pre|dece&s;&s;ors had ju&s;tly merited for him and his De|&s;cendants, by &s;o many Brave and Glorious Actions.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of the peoples di&s;cour&s;e, who were animated by the name of <HI>Orange,</HI> which they repeated, every moment, without paying any deference to the Orders of the States. And the Drummers that beat up for rai&s;ing of Seamen, with|out making u&s;e of the old accu&s;tomed Terms, <HI>In the name of the Prince of</HI> Orange, were ill handled by the people; &s;o that at la&s;t the Government was obliged to publi&s;h an Ordinance to put a &s;top to tho&s;e Commotion; and at the &s;ame time another was likewi&s;e &s;et out, to forbid the car|rying of any Provi&s;ions to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet that lay before the <HI>Texel</HI> and the <HI>&V;lie.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did a wonderful deal of mi&s;chief upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Holland,</HI> but were partly puni&s;hed for it by the lo&s;s of 3 of their Ships that run a Ground upon the Sands of the Coa&s;t; they had al&s;o &s;ome Boats over&s;et.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t all the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> wrought with all the diligence imaginable upon the Fleet, in order to Repair and Re-inforce, and Man, and Provide it &s;ufficiently to be in a capa|city to put again to Sea. But becau&s;e mo&s;t part of the Ships were equipt in <HI>Zealand,</HI> they were in extreme pain to &s;tudy out a means, how tho&s;e that came from <HI>Zealand</HI> &s;hould joyn with tho&s;e that were in the <HI>Texel,</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were Ma&s;ters of its enterance, and kept the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Holland</HI> be&s;ieged.

<P>About that time the States General of the United Provinces, to encourage their Officers and Sea men of the Fleet, the more heartily and warmly to be&s;tir them&s;elves in the Service of their Country, by the hopes of Reward, publi&s;ht a Declaration, which was Read on Board every Man of War, and was as follows.</P>

However, after all, being engaged a great way within the very heart of the Enemies Fleet, he found him&s;elf overpower'd by their Numbers, and de&s;erted by his own Ships, at which, conceiving a mortal re&s;entment, he uttered the&s;e words: <HI>VVill any thing be done or no?

<P>In the mean while, the Ship, <HI>Brederode</HI> was engaged within the main Body of the Enemies Fleet; and becau&s;e every one attentively lookt out to &s;ee whether the Bloody Flagg which was the &s;ignal for coming on board, appeared upon the Admirals Poop, the Chief Officers of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, found by that, they were Com|manded on board the Admiral.

<P>Upon this fatal blow, it appear'd what a de|&s;perate and undaunted re&s;olution are able to make men do: For all the Captains of the Fleet were &s;o &s;en&s;ibly toucht at the lo&s;s of their Admiral, that breathing nothing but rage and fury, they pierced three times through and through the Enemies Fleet, fiercely firing at and battering all that oppo&s;ed their pa&s;&s;age; but as an addition to the unhappine&s;s of that unfortunate day, Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI>'s Ship, who after <HI>Tromp</HI>'s death had the chief Command of the Fleet, was &s;o mi&s;erably &s;hattered and di&s;abled, that to avoid falling into the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> they were

<P>The <HI>English</HI> Admiral being grappled by two Fire-Ships, his Ship was in an in&s;tant all in a flame, and &s;ome of his men began already to flie out of her; they which were about Captain <HI>Peacock</HI> were at the la&s;t extremity; and Cap|tain <HI>Bitter</HI> was compleating their de&s;truction by plying them with frequent broad-&s;ides, but that one of the Fire-Ships hapning to be too &s;lowly pu&s;ht forward, gave time and occa&s;ion to the <HI>English</HI> to take new Courage, and briskly to im|ploy their Guns again, and beat off their Ene|mies. The <HI>English</HI> Ship, the St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> having been furiou&s;ly battered by the Guns of Vice-Admiral <HI>Flori&s;z,</HI> was &s;o terribly maul'd and &s;hat|tered, that it was ready to &s;ink, being half con|&s;umed with the flames, had not two other Ships come in timely to her aid, and re&s;cued her from the Eminent danger &s;he was in.

<P>After &s;o fatal a rout, 30 other Ships that were lea&s;t endamaged, came out of the Rear guard and advanced again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And Rear Ad|miral <HI>Flori&s;z</HI> endeavoured with tho&s;e feeble and &s;hattered relicks of &s;o potent a Fleet, to cover the Admiral Ship the <HI>Brederode,</HI> which was in &s;o much the more danger of falling into the Ene|mies hands, bccau&s;e &s;he was &s;o cruelly &s;hattered, that &s;he was incapable of making any Re&s;i&s;t|ance.

<P>That unexpected firmne&s;s and re&s;olution &s;o much &s;urprized the <HI>English,</HI> that being advanced as far as right again&s;t the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Brederode,</HI> they put up all the &s;ail they could, and &s;teered a|way towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> quitting tho&s;e of <HI>Holland</HI> with much regret, and &s;ore a|gain&s;t their Wills, as thinking they had won Glory enough, and that it would be too much to expo&s;e both it and their Fleet, in the &s;hattered condition they were in, to pro&s;ecute their Vi|ctory too far, and that after they had been at home and recruited, they might in&s;ult as they plea&s;ed over their vanqui&s;ht foes, before they could recover them&s;elves of this la&s;t fatal blow. In their retreat, they &s;et fire to &s;ome of their Ships that were &s;o &s;hattered and maul'd, that they were not able to get them back into their Ports. By favour of the night, the flames were &s;een from far, and the Sea was enlighted with them almo&s;t as much as if it had been by the Sun-beams at Noon day.

And after having often broken the Forces of the <HI>Dunkirkers,</HI> but e&s;pecially at <HI>Mar|dyke;</HI> after having fir&s;t repre&s;t the formidable Fleet of <HI>Spain,</HI> and afterwards intirely defeated it upon the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t; after &s;everal other Brave Actions, wherein, tho he were mo&s;t commonly in|feriour to the Enemies in Force and Numbers, yet was ever &s;uperiour to them in Valour, Courage, and Experience, <HI>and always undaunted and un|conquered:</HI> At la&s;t the Republick being of late unexpectedly ingaged in a Sea War with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> whil&s;t he &s;pared neither the Enemies nor him|&s;elf, but was wholly devoted to the publick good, the

<P>And indeed that valiant Man may be &s;aid to have ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e his Fortune in Arms, without any o|ther Support or Backers than his own per&s;onal Merit and Bravery. He was born at the <HI>Brill,</HI> in the year 1597, and was but 9 years old when he began to go to Sea, with his Father, Captain <HI>Harpert Martin Tromp,</HI> with whom he was pre|&s;ent at the famous Battle fought near <HI>Gibraltar</HI> under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>Hemskirk.</HI> Some time after, following his Father again in a Crui&s;e he made towards <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> or the Coa&s;t of <HI>Gui|ney,</HI> where being attackt by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateer, his Father lo&s;t his Life in the Skirmi&s;h, and af|ter &s;o &s;en&s;ible a lo&s;s, the Ship being taken by the &s;aid Privateer, young <HI>Tromp</HI> was con&s;train'd to &s;erve the Captain as his Cabbin Boy for about two years and a half, but afterwards, he found means to di&s;engage him&s;elf. From that time for|ward, he got &s;ome Employments. In the year 1617 he was made Quarterma&s;ter under Captain <HI>Mooy Lambert,</HI> and afterwards Pilot or Ma&s;ter of the &s;ame Ship. After having made a Voyage towards the Straits, in a Merchant Ship called the <HI>Tuch|thuys;</HI> he was taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> but by the parti|cular favour of the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Algier,</HI> he was re|lea&s;ed.
<PB N="158" REF="85"> In the year 1622, he was made a Lieute|nant under Captain <HI>Bagyn,</HI> and after a little while, removed into Captain <HI>Jonge Boes</HI>'s Ship in the &s;ame Quality. Two years after, Prince <HI>Mau|rice</HI> made him Captain of a little Frigat which car|ried but 40 men, &s;o that having run through all man|ner of Sea Employments, there was nothing done remarkable at Sea during the en&s;uing years, but he was pre&s;ent at it, giving every where &s;ig|nal proofs of his Great Vertue and Conduct.</P>
<P>In the year 1629, <HI>De Hein</HI> who had made him|&s;elf famous by taking &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Galleons la|den with Silver, being made Lieutenant Admiral of <HI>Holland,</HI> put again to Sea in the Ship called the <HI>Green Dragon,</HI> which was a very fleet Sailer, but was &s;oon after unfortunately killed by <HI>Tromp</HI>'s &s;ide. The Te&s;timony he gave of <HI>Tromp</HI> is altogether remarkable. He had, &s;aid he, known many brave Captains, in whom he had however &s;till found &s;ome failing or other, but in <HI>Tromp</HI> he profe&s;&s;ed he never had ob&s;erved any thing but what was great and vertuous, and therefore judg'd him to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the happy Qualities nece&s;&s;ary in an Admiral. The Ship that <HI>Heins</HI> was in, was, as we have &s;aid, a very good Sailer, but after he was dead, it was by favour given to another and not to <HI>Tromp,</HI> at which, he was &s;o &s;en&s;ibly di&s;plea&s;ed, that out of meer indignation he quitted the Sea, and retired into the Country, where he exerci&s;ed an employ|ment that only at a di&s;tance related to Marine Affairs.</P>
<P>In the year 1637 Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Dorp</HI> having quitted the &s;ervice, Prince <HI>Frederick Henry,</HI> upon the recommendation of the States of <HI>Hol|land,</HI> gave the Command of the Fleet to <HI>Tromp,</HI> in quality of Lieutenant Admiral, with a provi|&s;ional Commi&s;&s;ion only for one year: which time being expired, the Prince granted him a Con|tinuation of it with a more ample Commi&s;&s;ion. In the &s;equel, he got a great deal of Honour, and
<PB N="159" REF="85"> &s;ignalized him&s;elf in divers Battles which he fought again&s;t the <HI>Dunkirkers,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o that he was lookt upon by all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> to be the able&s;t and mo&s;t valiant Sea Commander of the Age in which he lived. He was &s;o tenderly beloved by the Seamen, that both the Captains and Mariners u&s;ed to call him their Father, and <HI>Tromp</HI> out of a Reciprocal love to them, u&s;ed to call them likewi&s;e, his Chil|dren. But there was nothing &s;o admirable in him as the Moderation, and cool and &s;edate Temper of blood which he &s;hewed in the greate&s;t heat of a fight in which he Commanded. For he appear|ed as quiet and compo&s;ed when he gave his Or|ders, as if he had been at home in his own hou&s;e under &s;afe &s;helter from all dangers.</P>
<P>But to recontinue the thred of our Di&s;cour&s;e, <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Ship which was quite di&s;abled to keep the Sea any longer, was carried out of the fight by Captain <HI>Aldert&s;z,</HI> and arrived about the Dusk of Night, before the Meu&s;e. The next day two Gentlemen came on board the Admiral, and delivered him a Letter from the States of <HI>Hol|land</HI> in which their High and Mightine&s;&s;es de|manded of him an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of the Battle, and of the de&s;tiny of their Fleet. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> an&s;wered the States, and in few words related to them all the Circum&s;tances of the Battle according to the be&s;t knowledge he had of them. The day following he entered into the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> where Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> came to him from <HI>Goree,</HI> and brought him a Letter from the States General, by which he was Ordered to remove into <HI>Evert&s;z</HI>'s Galleot, and to go along joyntly with him, in &s;earch of the Fleet. Pur|&s;uant to which, they &s;ailed along by the Coa&s;t, and found Captain <HI>Taneman</HI> to the Northward of the Meu&s;e, who&s;e Ship being already &s;unk 14 Fathom deep under Water, &s;hewed nothing but the very Tops of her M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ts.</P>
<PB N="160" REF="86">
<P>At about 2 miles from <HI>Scheveling,</HI> they found Captain <HI>Swart</HI> at Anchor, who Commanded a Ship fraighted by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t-India</HI> Company. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> and <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> then Rowed off further into the Sea, to learn what news they could of the Enemies Fleet. The 13th of the &s;ame Month, they came towards the <HI>Texel,</HI> where they found the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet to be 84 &s;ail &s;trong of Men of War, be&s;ides 12 more that were in the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> at <HI>Goree,</HI> or&punc; in <HI>Zealand,</HI> &s;o that, if they gave a true account, the <HI>Dutch</HI> lo&s;t in all but 9 Ships in the whole Fight, as has been already &s;aid.</P>
<P>The States General of the United Provinces being willing to per&s;wade all <HI>Europe,</HI> that it was not without &s;ome grounds, they gloried to have gained con&s;iderable advantages in that Battle, &s;ince they had thereby freed their Coa&s;ts and Harbors from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>English,</HI> who had a long time held them &s;traightly block'd up and be&s;ieged, u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible care to make their interrupted Commerce flouri&s;h again. For that de&s;ign, they a&s;&s;embled a great Fleet of Merchant Ships, bound part of them to the North, and part to the We&s;tward; be&s;ides which, there were &s;everal others bound homewards from the <HI>Indies,</HI> and from divers parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> which waited in the <HI>Sound,</HI> or in the Ports of <HI>Nor|way,</HI> for a Convoy.</P>
<P>Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> to whom the chief Com|mand of the Fleet was then given, &s;et &s;ail the 10th. of <HI>September,</HI> with a Fleet of 40 &s;ail, Compo&s;ed of the Ships that had &s;uffered the lea&s;t damage in the la&s;t fight. 70 Merchant Ships from the <HI>Texel,</HI> and 100 more from the <HI>&V;lie</HI> came out and joyned him. On the 30th of <HI>Sep|tember</HI> he arrived with this Potent Fleet near little <HI>Holms,</HI> where he met 5 <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships, and a great many other Merchant Ships coming from the <HI>Sound</HI> under the Convoy of 14 <HI>Da|nish</HI> Men of War, who unmoored upon his ap|proach,
<PB N="161" REF="86"> and joyned them&s;elves to the Admiral's Flag. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there joyned him above 160 more, coming from <HI>Mardon,</HI> and other Havens. And over and above all tho&s;e, there came to him from time to time re-inforcements of &s;everal men of War, from <HI>Holland,</HI> which Augmented his Fleet at la&s;t to the Number of 76 &s;ail of Men of War, which together with the Merchant Men, made up a Fleet of 400 &s;ail; who all came happily into the <HI>Texel</HI> or the <HI>&V;lie</HI> at the begin|ning of <HI>November,</HI> without meeting any <HI>English,</HI> tho' they were then at Sea with a Fleet of 50 &s;ail of &s;trong Men of War. The States having re&s;olved to keep their Fleet out at Sea all Win|er, the Men of War that were to compo&s;e it kept about the <HI>Texel,</HI> to take in Provi&s;ions of Victuals, when a furious Tempe&s;t ari&s;ing, had like to have de&s;troyed them. The Fleet then con&s;i&s;t|ed of 76 Men of War, as we have &s;aid, be&s;ides two Flutes laden with Ammunition and Provi&s;i|on. A&s;&s;oon as the Wind began to fre&s;hen, they &s;et &s;ail towards the Main Sea, and came to an Anchor within 2 miles and a half to the Ea&s;t|ward of <HI>Kykduin.</HI> The Wind fre&s;hning again on the 9th. of <HI>November,</HI> before day, blew af|terwards &s;o fiercely and with &s;o much violence, from the We&s;t-North-We&s;t, turning &s;ometimes full to the North-We&s;t, that &s;everal Ships were driven upon their Anchors, and others having cut down their Main ma&s;ts run into the <HI>Texel,</HI> without con&s;idering the great danger they there|by expo&s;ed them&s;elves to. The night following the blu&s;tering Weather &s;till continued, and the next day grew &s;o furious, mixt with a fierce &s;torm of hail, that Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> and 10 other Ships of the Fleet were thereby driven from their Moorings, &s;everal peri&s;h'd, and others were &s;tranded upon the Coa&s;ts.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="87">
<P>On the third day the Tempe&s;t abated a lit|tle, when of &s;o potent a Fleet there remained but 47 Ships, 23 of which had had all their Ma&s;ts and Rigging blown away clo&s;e by the board. But &s;uch a di&s;a&s;ter as that had been in &s;ome mea&s;ure more &s;upportable if it had not been unhappily follow'd by the &s;ad news of the lo&s;s of 12 or 13 men of War that had likewi&s;e peri&s;h't together with a Fleet laden with Am|munition, and &s;everal Merchant Ships, and a great many people with them. There were &s;ome Ships all who&s;e men were drown'd without &s;o much as one Per&s;on e&s;caping: And they which were left were &s;o endamaged, that when the Weather grew calm, they were forced to return into their Harbours to repair and re&s;it them&s;elves. Nei|ther did the <HI>English</HI> Fleet come off at a much Cheaper rate, for after being very roughly u&s;ed by the Tempe&s;t, the Parliament thinking them uncapable to keep the Sea any longer, ordered them to put into their Ports to be di&s;arm|ed.</P>
<P>About that time there was &s;pread abroad in <HI>Holland</HI> a Lamentable report of the deplo|rable condition into which the <HI>Dutch</HI> pri&s;oners in <HI>England</HI> were reduced, and the cruel treat|ment reported to be u&s;ed to them there, which exci|ted a mo&s;t raging and furious re&s;entment in all peo|ple at &s;uch &s;uppo&s;ed barbarity. Their Number was about 900, who were &s;aid to be mo&s;t of them &s;hut up in the then old decayed, unfini&s;h't and uncovered College of <HI>Chel&s;ey,</HI> between four bare walls, in the wide fields, expo&s;ed to the open skie, and to all the rigours of the &s;ea&s;on, laid only upon &s;traw without any thing to cover them: &s;o that many of them not able to en|dure that mi&s;ery died. Nay, and 'twas affirmed further, that the hard-heartedne&s;s of the <HI>English</HI> proceeded &s;o far again&s;t tho&s;e poor wretches, as to forbid tho&s;e of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation that lived
<PB N="163" REF="87"> at <HI>London,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t them as they had before done 'till towards the end of the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> ha|ving expended from the beginning to that time above 500 <HI>l.</HI> Sterlin in relieving them, &s;o that coming afterwards to want that charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance, many of them langui&s;h'd to death. Some of them looking upon the peril of an ine|vitable death as the le&s;&s;er evil of the two, pre|ferred it before &s;o many &s;ufferings, and endea|voured to make their e&s;capes, tho' with the evi|dent hazard of breaking their necks, by clam|bering over the Walls, but when any of them were perceived &s;o attempting, the Soldiers would not fail mo&s;t mercile&s;ly to &s;hoot them, or el&s;e to run them through with their &s;words.

<P>On the 30th. he began to come in &s;ight of it, and coming up with the Captains he had &s;ent before, they reported to him, that they had been &s;o near the Town, that they had &s;een people walking on the Caw&s;ey, and di&s;cerned 5 Ships in the road, and 6 or 7 within the Mole. The &s;ame night <HI>de Ruiter</HI> advanced with his Squa|dron, within Cannon &s;hot of the Town, and Anchored in 42 Fathoms depth of Water. The 2 Yachts, the <HI>Pearl,</HI> and <HI>Fortune</HI> were already prepared for an Enterprize; and the better to deceive the Cor&s;airs, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> Commanded all his Captains, to put up <HI>English</HI> Colours. Up|on which, tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> &s;hew'd them&s;elves upon &s;ome &s;mall ve&s;&s;els near the &s;hore, but dur&s;t not come very near the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Then the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains being all &s;ummoned on board the Admiral, a Council of War was held; wherein it was re&s;olved, that in the night by fa|vour of the Land Breezes, they &s;hould make &s;ail, to Conduct, if it were po&s;&s;ible, their Fire-Ships back by 3 men of War, up to the Brigantines to burn them, but &s;o great a Calm la&s;ted all the night, that it was hard to know on which &s;ide the Wind was. The next Morning it con|tinued &s;till Calm, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> perceived that the 5 Brigantines that were in the Road the day before, were then retired within the Mole, &s;o that it was not difficult to Judge by the Counte|nance of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that they were upon their guard.</P>
<PB N="176" REF="94">
<P> <MILESTONE N="1654"> Whereupon another Council of War, being called, it was re&s;olved, that &s;ince by rea&s;on of the Calm, it was impo&s;&s;ible to undertake any thing upon the Enemy, they &s;hould weigh An|chor, and make the be&s;t of their way towards <HI>Malaga;</HI> which accordingly was put in Execu|tion about noon. As the <HI>Dutch</HI> drew near that place, they di&s;covered &s;ome Cor&s;air Ships, to which they gave chace; and on the 17th. of <HI>September,</HI> they took a <HI>Tetuan</HI> Brigantine man|ned with 20 <HI>Moors,</HI> who&s;e Captain was a <HI>Spa|nish</HI> Renegado named <HI>Arnando Dias,</HI> who had done a great deal of mi&s;chief to the Chri&s;tians, and had cau&s;ed very great lo&s;&s;es to them, having in about 12 years time, made near 2000 &s;laves whom he had all cruelly &s;old, and among&s;t them, as 'twas credibly related, &s;ome of his own near kindred; and bragged &s;everal times, that he would treat his own Father after the &s;ame manner, if he fell into his hands; And therefore according to his Execrable merits, he was immediately hang|ed up upon a Top-ma&s;t.</P>
<P>On the 9th. of the &s;ame Month, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> continued on his Cour&s;e, and arrived two days after, in the bay of <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> the day follow|ing, weighing Anchor, he repa&s;t the <HI>Streights,</HI> and &s;teered his Cour&s;e towards <HI>Cadiz,</HI> with de|&s;ign to make for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary.</HI> On the 27th. he di&s;covered 2 Cor&s;air Ships at the mouth of the <HI>Streights</HI> to the Ea&s;tward, and another to the South-We&s;t-ward. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> gave chace to this la&s;t, as appearing to be the bigge&s;t of them. The Cor&s;air made away as fa&s;t as &s;he could, directly towards <HI>Arzila,</HI> a little Town in the Kingdom of <HI>Fez</HI> about 12 Leagues from <HI>Tangier.</HI> And it proved to be the Admiral's Ship of <HI>Algier,</HI> that was taken from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> but the year before, and by the <HI>Dutch</HI> was called <HI>the Wheel of Fortune,</HI> but by the <HI>Turks,</HI> named <HI>the Golden Palm-tree.</HI> That Ship was full as

<P><HI>De Ruiter</HI> cha&s;ed her as far as into the very Haven of <HI>Arzila,</HI> where with much ado &s;he made a &s;hift to &s;ave her &s;elf, after having lo&s;t many of her men in the fight, and principally her Cap|tain who lo&s;t his life in the Skirmi&s;h. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet continuing on their Cour&s;e, came and Anchored in the road of <HI>Sally,</HI> on the 1&s;t. of <HI>October,</HI> after they had taken one <HI>Turkish</HI> Ship and a <HI>Tartan,</HI> and &s;tranded a Renegado Cor&s;air. <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> at his arrival &s;aluted the Town with 9 Guns, the great Ca&s;tle an&s;wer|ing him with 5, and the little one with 4, after which, according to his Commi&s;&s;ion, he endea|voured to enter into a Negotiation with the Deputies of <HI>Sall,</HI> in order to appea&s;e the dif|ferences they had with the United Provinces; but he being delayed &s;everal days without being able to do any thing, and in the mean while receiving advice, that the mo&s;t part of the <HI>Tur|kish</HI> Pyrates kept the pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Streights</HI> &s;hut up, and returned daily from thence to <HI>Al|giers</HI> with Prizes, he thought it was not nece&s;|&s;ary for him to &s;tay in <HI>Sally</HI> road with all his whole Squadron; but calling thereupon a Con|&s;ultation of his Captains on board him, it was re&s;olved, that <HI>de Wilde,</HI> and Rear Admiral <HI>Ver|veen,</HI> and Captain <HI>Zaalingen,</HI> &s;hould &s;ail away towards the Streights, to give cha&s;e to the Cor&s;airs. And accordingly they unmoor'd with the New Moon, &s;teering towards <HI>Cadiz,</HI> whil&s;t on the o|ther &s;ide, Captain <HI>Vander Zaan</HI> kept out a cruizing with two Men of War more. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> in the mean while &s;taid with two of the &s;hips of his Squadron, before <HI>Sally&punc;</HI> to pur&s;ue the Negotiation of the Treaty.

<P>Vice-Admiral <HI>de Wit</HI> putting out likewi&s;e from the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> with &s;everal men of War more, came and joyned the Fleet, which afterward &s;et|ting &s;ail, arrived at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> on the 29th. of the &s;aid Month, and the next day, the States Amba&s;&s;adors, advi&s;ing them to continue on their way, they &s;et &s;ail again to enter into the <HI>Bal|tick</HI> Sea, &s;o that 6 days after, the whole Fleet came to an Anchor in <HI>Dantzick</HI> road, being 42 &s;ail of Frigats and men of War,; <HI>viz.</HI> 7 of <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> 24 of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> 7 of North-<HI>Hol|land,</HI> 2 of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and 2 of <HI>Frie&s;land.</HI></P>
<P>At the arrival of this Potent Fleet, the Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Termund,</HI> which is at the Mouth of the <HI>Vi&s;tula</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> &s;aluted them with &s;everal Guns, and immediately after, &s;ome Emi|nent Per&s;ons came in a Galliot from the Town on board the Admiral, to &s;alute him, and to let him know the Joy the whole regency was in at his arrival. Mr. <HI>Fabricius</HI> Pen&s;ionary of the Town, and famous for his great learning, Com|plimented Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Opdam,</HI> from the
<PB N="187" REF="99"> Magi&s;trates, and invited him in their name, to be plea&s;ed to come a&s;hore into their Town; and the publick rejoycings and other tran&s;ports of joy which all the People &s;hew'd upon that occa|&s;ion, la&s;ted &s;everal days. The States had had notice given them &s;ome time before, as from the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> that his &s;aid Maje&s;ty had form'd a de&s;ign to block up the Town of <HI>Dantzick,</HI> and afterwards to be&s;iege it, and that he prayed their High and Mightine&s;&s;es to be plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend their Commerce during that time, and to for|bid all Merchant Ships belonging to their State, to go thither to take in any fraight. But the unexpected arrival of that Fleet broke all the de&s;igns of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> and tho' it was &s;ent out for no other end but to free the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea from the Yoke of that power, yet it was &s;trong enough to make all the fair hopes that Crown had conceived of Compa&s;&s;ing &s;o great an En|terprize as that vani&s;ht to into &s;moak, and that without any effu&s;ion of blood. On the 1&s;t. of <HI>September</HI> following there appeared likewi&s;e at Sea, a Fleet of 9 Dani&s;h Men of War under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>Lindenhout,</HI> which came al&s;o and Anchored before <HI>Dantzick.</HI> They had the &s;ame de&s;ign as had the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, which was to de|fend that Han&s;eatick Town and the Freedom of Navigation. In the mean time, the States De|puties, <HI>Slingeland, Van Dorp, de Hubert,</HI> and <HI>Jabrandt</HI> being entred into a Negotiation at <HI>El|bing</HI> with the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> Plenipotentiaries about a Treaty of Alliance, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet that continued &s;till before <HI>Dantzick</HI> Contributed much to advance it, &s;o that it was concluded and &s;igned on the 1&s;t. of <HI>September,</HI> on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>The States knowing the above&s;aid Treaty with <HI>Swedeland,</HI> was upon the point of being con|clu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, thought fit to recall Lieutentant Admi|ral <HI>Opdam</HI> with 30 of the bigge&s;t Ships of War of the Fleet, and to leave Rear Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>
<PB N="188" REF="100"> in his place, with a Squadron only of 12 o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the lighte&s;t Ships. And the Letters that con|tained this order were delivered him at <HI>Dant|zick,</HI> at the beginning of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>The Dani&s;h Squadron was already &s;ailed away ever &s;ince the 25th. of <HI>September,</HI> for <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> whither the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had recalled it, as being ill &s;atisfied at the Treaty Concluded with <HI>Swedeland</HI> without his privity. In fine, on the 6th. of <HI>October,</HI> the mo&s;t part of the Troops that were on board the Fleet, were re|moved, and di&s;tributed into the 12 Ships that were to &s;tay in the road; only 280 men which there was no room to place there, entred into the Town by the Magi&s;trates leave, and towards the Evening, the Fleet &s;ailed away. But before his departure, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI> received a pre&s;ent from the Magi&s;trates of a very fine Silver Ewer with a cro&s;&s;ed handle, valued at 600 Crowns.</P>
<P>Not long after the departure of the Grand Fleet, Vice Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> received likewi&s;e or|ders from the States, to quit the <HI>Baltick</HI> Sea, and to return into <HI>Holland,</HI> with his Squadron. So that having landed 1200 Musketeers he had on boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d his Fleet, they were placed in the Town to help to guard it, together with tho&s;e that had been &s;ent thither before.

The af|fair pa&s;&s;ed in this manner: Tbe Soldiers that were in the fir&s;t of the&s;e Ships revolted again&s;t their Officers, &s;aying they were inrol'd for the Service of <HI>Dant|zick</HI> and not for the King of <HI>Swedeland;</HI> they were by the ill weather forced to Anchor near <HI>Heel,</HI> where they con&s;trained their Officers and their Pilot, to carry them to <HI>Dantzick.</HI> Being come into the <HI>Vi&s;tula,</HI> they reported, that Gene|ral <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> lay at Anchor in the &s;ame place, upon which Advice <HI>3</HI> Galliots were &s;ent towards him, who attackt him before noon, &s;o that he was made pri&s;oner in &s;ight of our Fleet.

<P>To report the misfortune of General <HI>Kon|ing&s;mark</HI> with its principal Circum&s;tances, you mu&s;t know, that at his departure from <HI>Stetin,</HI> there was a &s;hip which had on board her, 130 <HI>Scotch</HI> Soldiers, that &s;et &s;ail at the &s;ame time with him, &s;teering her cour&s;e towards <HI>Pilau;</HI> but a Tempe&s;t, and a contrary Wind having kept them back 10 days upon the Sea, the Ship being o|ver loaden with &s;oldiers, fell a Leaking &s;o very much that &s;he could no longer keep the Sea, which obliged the &s;oldiers to take arms again&s;t their Officers, and the Ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, whom they forced at length to Land them at <HI>Dant|zick,</HI> where they informed the Magi&s;trates where|abouts <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> lay at Anchor. Upon that

The preacher perceiving the Enemies, gave notice of it to the General, who thereupon Commanded the Pilot to cut the An|chor-Cables, and with all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to make all the &s;ail away he could: But the Pilot an|&s;wering him, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to do it, he gave Orders to his men to do every man his be&s;t to defend them&s;elves; But before they could get into a po&s;ture of defence the Enemies boarded him, <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> retiring in|to the Ma&s;ter's Cabbin, demanded Quarter, which was granted to him and all his Men. So that this General, as great a Commander as he was, yet for want of skill in the Art of fighting at Sea; that skirmi&s;h being perhaps the fir&s;t of that kind he ever was in, was forced to yield him&s;elf at the di&s;cretion of the Victors, who carried him pri|&s;oner to <HI>Dantzick.</HI></P>
<P>But to return again to the States Fleet, Lieu|tenant Admiral <HI>Opdam</HI> entred on the 6th. of <HI>November</HI> into <HI>Helvoet&s;luys</HI> with a part of the men of War that compo&s;ed the Fleet, and the re&s;t of them almo&s;t at the &s;ame time got into the <HI>&V;lie;</HI> and &s;ome weeks after, Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> followed with his Squadron.</P>

<P>The lo&s;&s;es the Privateers had cau&s;ed to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for &s;everal years pa&s;t, in the Neigh|bouring Seas, and e&s;pecially in the Mediterranean were very great, and &s;en&s;ible. For when the Sieur <HI>Boreel,</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from the United Provinces arrived at the Court of <HI>France</HI> towards the end of the year 1650, there were already 168 <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant &s;hips taken by <HI>French</HI> Ca|pers, &s;ince which, they were reckoned to have taken 160 more, &s;o that the whole Number of all tho&s;e prizes amounted to near 328 Ships which the Privateers of that Nation had taken, Detained, Pillaged, or Confi&s;cated without any other grounds than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of a manife&s;t u&s;urpati|on.

Whereupon, the States General being at length wearied out with making &s;o many fruit|le&s;s Complaints, and apprehending le&s;t their o|ver great Patience might ruin their Commerce and their Subjects, they re&s;olv'd at la&s;t to free them&s;elves from all tho&s;e Robberies by force of Arms, and to make u&s;e of repri&s;als. And accor|dingly they Ordered <HI>de Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ter</HI> to attack the <HI>French</HI> Men of War that came out of the Ports of Provence to make excur&s;ions in the Mediter|ranean, and to do all he could to take or &s;ink them. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> then had been informed, as we have &s;aid, by a <HI>Hamburger,</HI> that 2 <HI>French</HI> Priva|teers
<PB N="193" REF="102"> that had Plundred him were &s;till roving about tho&s;e Seas. And on the 28th. of <HI>February</HI> at break of day, he di&s;covered 2 &s;hips near the I&s;le of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> at about 3 miles di&s;tance from him, which &s;eemed to look &s;harp after him, but when they came nearer within about a Mile of him, they begun to find they had to deal with men of War, and not with Merchant &s;hips, which made them betake them&s;elves to flight. However, about noon the &s;hips of both Parties met between <HI>Gorgona</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Cor&s;ica,</HI> without firing &s;o much as a Gun on either &s;ide. Then <HI>de Ruiter</HI> Commanded the Cap|tain of the bigge&s;t Caper to enter into his Boat, and come on board him; but the Captain contented him&s;elf to &s;end his Lieutenant whom <HI>de Ruit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> detained, &s;ending word to the Cap|tain again that if he refu&s;ed to obey his &s;um|mons, he would immediately board him, and would make him &s;uffer the puni&s;hment due to his ob&s;tinacy: At this &s;econd Command he en|tred into the Boat, and came on board the Ad|miral. Whil&s;t <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and <HI>de Wilde</HI> kept clo&s;e to the great Caper, the Captain <HI>Ooms,</HI> and <HI>Vander Zaan</HI> gave chace to the other, and like|wi&s;e Commanded the Captain to come on board the Admiral, which he having done, <HI>Vander Zaan</HI> detained him likewi&s;e. So that the 2 Privateers &s;eeing there was no hopes to e&s;cape, drew in their Guns out of their port-holes, and throwing down their Arms, &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the Clemen|cy of the Victor. They were 2 <HI>Swedish</HI> Ships which &s;ome time before had been pre&s;ented to the French King, but were afterwards Armed out by &s;ome Private Per&s;ons, and employed in the Pyrating Trade. The bigge&s;t of them called the Queen, had on board her 230 men, and 32 guns, whereof 30 were bra&s;s, the le&s;&s;er which was called the Hunter, carried 182 men, and 28 guns, whereof 18 were bra&s;s. The <HI>French</HI> Sea|men
<PB N="194" REF="103"> that were on board them, were Con|ducted in 3 Barks, to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> but the Cap|tains and Lieutenants were kept by the <HI>Hollan|ders,</HI> and their &s;hips carried to <HI>Cadiz.</HI></P>
<P>The news of the taking of the&s;e 2 Privateers made a great noi&s;e in <HI>France,</HI> the Court there looking upon it as the mo&s;t hanious attempt that <HI>de Ruiter</HI> could have committed in time of profound Peace. And Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> who then had the chief management of all the Af|fairs of the Kingdom, pretended to make it pa&s;s for an outrage that deeply wounded the Glory of his Ma&s;ter, and was a cruel &s;troke at his Grandure, and at that deference the United Provin|ces ought to have for it. They gave out, that tho&s;e &s;hips were the Kings, and that it was an intollera|ble piece of Boldne&s;s, to offer to attackt and &s;eize them. And therefore in revenge, Expre&s;s orders were &s;ent to all the Harbours in the Kingdom, immediately to &s;eize all Ships, Merchan|dizes, and effects belonging to the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> which was executed accordingly. The Haughty and Imperious manner with which the Court of <HI>France</HI> treated the United Provinces on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as that, &s;urpri&s;ed them &s;o much the more, becau&s;e the King having at fir&s;t imputed that pretended Ho&s;tile attempt wholly to <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> believed he had done it without the knowledge or con&s;ent of his Ma&s;ters, who ex|pected nothing le&s;s, than to &s;ee their Subjects to be ill treated by the confi&s;cation of the &s;hips and goods they had in that Kingdom. And that way of proceeding &s;eemed &s;o much the harder upon them, in that the <HI>French</HI> Court had pa&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d to the Execution of it without any warning given to the States, or de&s;iring to know of them, whether they approved or di&s;approved of that Action of <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> and without &s;o much as &s;uffering their High and Mightine&s;&s;es, after having &s;o often reiterated by their Amba&s;&s;adors &s;o ma|ny
<PB N="195" REF="103"> great and ju&s;t Complaints of the damages they &s;uffered by the <HI>French</HI> Privateers, to do them&s;elves Ju&s;tice. The States of <HI>Holland,</HI> though they had the greate&s;t intere&s;t of any of the Provinces, in a Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> were for intirely forbidding all Trade with that King|dom; after they had &s;eized and &s;topt all French &s;hips and effects in <HI>Holland,</HI> and all the other Pro|vinces. But the States General not being &s;o much concerned at what pa&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> as the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> That Re&s;olution was let fall, and came to nothing. All that they could do, was only, to prevail with the States Ge|neral, to Summon Deputies to the <HI>Hague,</HI> from all the Colleges of the Admiralty, to Con&s;ult, about Arming out a Fleet of 48 men of War, which they re&s;olved to put out to Sea; with Orders, to give private notice to all Pilots and Ma&s;ters of Merchant &s;hips, to avoid the Ports of France. The States writ al&s;o to Mr. <HI>Boreel</HI> their Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>France,</HI> to repre&s;ent to His Maje&s;ty the inju&s;tice that was done them, in order to obtain a di&s;charge of the &s;hips, and Merchandizes, that were &s;eized; as likewi&s;e all the In&s;upportable Robberies Committed upon their Subjects for &s;everal years together by the <HI>French</HI> Privateers; without forgetting the 2 Capers taken by <HI>de Ruiter.</HI> But Mr. <HI>Bo|reel</HI> had prevented the&s;e Orders of the States before he received them. For immediately af|ter the abovemention'd Re&s;olution of the Court, he demanded Audience of the King, in Order to Repre&s;ent to him his Rea|&s;ons. Which being granted him, He Re|mon&s;trated very fully and at large, <HI>That it had been but fit before his Maje&s;ty had proceeded a|ny further, to notifie to the States General of the &V;nited Provinces, his Mrs. the rea&s;ons that in|duced the Court to take Re&s;olutions &s;o prejudicial to them, that the &s;aid States on their &s;ide, might
<PB N="196" REF="104"> enter into Con&s;ideration how to give his Maje&s;ty all agreeable &s;atisfaction on that Subject.

He ad|ded, that in the &s;pace of</HI> 9 <HI>years, as we have &s;aid, there had been about</HI> 328 <HI>Merchant Ships be|longing to the States Subjects, Taken or Plunder|ed; He made mention likewi&s;e of</HI> 58 <HI>&s;entences given again&s;t</HI> French <HI>Privateers, which he had &s;till in his hands, without ever having been able to get any of them put in Excution, through the fault of the Courts of ju&s;tice that were too indul|gent to tho&s;e Privateers, which made them &s;o in&s;o|lent and &s;editious, that they had ventured even to attempt upon the Authority of his Maje&s;ties Com|mi&s;&s;aries at</HI> Thoulon, <HI>by driving them away like mi&s;erable wretches; that the</HI> Dutch <HI>Con&s;ul na|med,</HI> de la Fleur, <HI>who re&s;ided at</HI> Thoulon, <HI>was attackt in the &s;treets by tho&s;e villains, who char|ged him with unmercifull blows, and would doubt|le&s;s have A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated him, if he had not found means to e&s;cape out of the reach of their fury, with great hazard of his life; and all that, with|out any other Rea&s;on, than becau&s;e he had deli|vered into the hands of his Maje&s;ties Commi&s;&s;i|oners, the &s;entences rendred again&s;t them, in Or|der to get them put effectually in Execution.

To which they an&s;wered him, that as to what concerned the taking of the &s;aid two &s;hips, and the Conduct of the States in that matter, they pretended to give him &s;uch a rea|&s;onable explication thereupon as &s;hould make it &s;o clear to him, that he him&s;elf would at|tribute all the Ju&s;tice to the States. In the mean while, the States of <HI>Holland</HI> among o|ther propo&s;itions made there, had Voted in the A&s;&s;embly of the States General, that to oblige the <HI>French</HI> King to &s;ubmit to rea&s;on, it was nece&s;|&s;ary to forbid all Commerce in any of the Mer|chandizes of <HI>France;</HI> to &s;top and &s;eize all Ships and effects belonging to the <HI>French,</HI> and to take all their Ships they could meet with at Sea. That further it would be requi&s;ite, to Augment
<PB N="198" REF="105"> the Fleet they had re&s;olved to Arm out, with 12 Ships of War more, to render it the more Potent.

<P>In fine, there was a great deal of rea&s;on to fear, that the&s;e growing troubles would quickly degenerate into a cruel War between the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> and the United Provinces: But tho&s;e two powers reflecting &s;eriou&s;ly upon the mi&s;|chiefs and Calamities &s;uch a War would a&s;&s;ured|ly bring upon the people on both &s;ides, <HI>France</HI> became more tractable and peaceable; And <HI>Hol|land</HI> having no other end than to pre&s;erve Peace with that Crown, it was at la&s;t agreed on both &s;ides, that the Ships and Effects of both Nations &s;hould be mutually relea&s;ed; that the two Ships the Queen and the Hunter, taken by <HI>de Ruiter</HI> &s;hould be re&s;tored, and that for the future, &s;uch proper mea&s;ures &s;hould be taken, as might be effectual to prevent the hapning of any more like di&s;orders.</P>

The Envoys then Repre&s;ented their Grievances, and demanded re&s;titution of all that had been taken from the States in <HI>Bra|&s;ile</HI> and el&s;ewhere, and an indemnification for all their lo&s;&s;es. But the <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> after &s;ome Con|ferences, an&s;wered, that they were re&s;olved to Re&s;tore nothing? No, not &s;o much as one foot of Land. So po&s;itive an An&s;wer as that put an end in an in&s;tant to their Negotiation. Some days before, that Court had put out an Order, to forbid all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships at <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and St. <HI>Hubes,</HI> to &s;tir out of tho&s;e Ports till further Order. In the mean while, the States Envoys &s;et on work the <HI>Dutch</HI> Con&s;ul, named <HI>Vander Hoeve;</HI> who u|&s;ed all imaginable ipmortunities at the Court of <HI>Portugal,</HI> to obtain a Liberty of Commerce, &s;ince

On the 26th. of the &s;ame Month, <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadron joyned the Admirals Flag, and the Fleet by that Junction, was reinforced to the Number of 27 or 28 men of War.

Twelve Regiments of <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, making in all 3000 Men, were made Pri&s;oners of War on this occa&s;ion.

As for the Cavalry that were taken, they were part of them di&s;tributed among the <HI>Danish, Imperial</HI> and <HI>Brandenburg</HI> Hor&s;e.

<P><HI>Funen</HI> being thus reduced under the Obedience of its rightful Prince, Vice-Admiral <HI>De Ruiter</HI> repre&s;ented to General <HI>Schak,</HI> That it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for the Fleet to &s;ub&s;i&s;t any longer in tho&s;e parts, becau&s;e of the Dearne&s;s of Provi&s;ions; adding, That the &s;wift advance of the Winter obliged him likewi&s;e to retire.

<P>In the mean while the Negotiation for a Peace, which the Plenipotentiaries of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> mediating Pow|ers were endeavouring, was drilled on to a tedious length, notwith&s;tanding the frequent Conferences they had about it in the Tent, erected for that effect between <HI>Copenhagen</HI> and the <HI>Swedish</HI> Army; which Delay was cau&s;ed by the Intrigues of the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours at the Court of <HI>Swedeland;</HI> for that they were &s;o far from endea|vouring heartily to bring that Power to an Accom|modation, that underhand they blew the Coals, and exa&s;perated Matters, by luring on that Court with the Airy Hopes of &s;everal Conque&s;ts.

<P> <MILESTONE N="1663"> Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> and Captain <HI>Schey</HI> had like|wi&s;e orders to go into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> with a Fleet of 10 Merchant Ships; and on the 1&s;t. day of <HI>January</HI> 1663, the two Fleets having met and &s;aluted one another, <HI>De Ruiter</HI> &s;teer'd towards <HI>A|licant,</HI> and <HI>Tromp</HI> towards <HI>Leghorn.</HI> Some weeks after, namely on the 17th of <HI>March, de Ruiter</HI> having receiv'd order from the States, to leave the Command of the Fleet that was to &s;tay in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> to <HI>Tromp,</HI> and to return back him&s;elf into <HI>Holland,</HI> accordingly left it to him, together with the nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tructions relating to what remained yet to be put in Execution; and at the &s;ame time put on Board of <HI>Tromp</HI> the Fi&s;cal <HI>Vyant,</HI> who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at all the Treaties that had been made with the <HI>Turks,</HI> that he might
<PB N="229" REF="120"> &s;erve him for his Coun&s;el. But in&s;tead of being a|ble to pacifie the turbulent humour of tho&s;e <HI>Bar|barians;</HI> the <HI>Algerine</HI> grew thereupon the more in&s;olent. For becau&s;e the Ratification of the Trea|ty was not pre&s;ently &s;ent them, and that &s;everal months had pa&s;t, without their &s;eeing either any one Dutch Man of War, or the promi&s;ed ran&s;ome for the Slaves of that Nation, they began to grow &s;o much the more impatient, becau&s;e the Plague that then raged among them, &s;weeping away many of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Slaves, deprived thereby their greedy Patrons of their Ran&s;om too; So that the mur|murs of tho&s;e di&s;contented <HI>Barbarians,</HI> &s;oon after broke out in new Ho&s;tilities. For at the beginning of the Summer, they took upon them to vi&s;it the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant Ships, and then under pretence they were laden with Merchandi&s;es belonging to their Enemies, they pillaged them without Con|troul. And not long after they carried a Dutch Merchant Ship to <HI>Algiers,</HI> confi&s;cated her Cargo, and &s;old her Men for Slaves. The States hear|ing of all the&s;e mi&s;chiefs Writ to their Con&s;ul there, <HI>Vanden Burg,</HI> to &s;ollicit the Re&s;titution of the Effects that were &s;eiz'd, and the Liberty of the Slaves tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians</HI> had newly made; But the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> refu&s;ing to give any &s;atisfaction, the States gave Orders, they &s;hould be obliged to it by force of Arms.</P>
<P>Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> therefore having begun to give them Chace, took &s;everal of them, <MILESTONE N="1664"> and freed thereby a great number of <HI>Chri&s;tian Slaves.</HI> And a|mong others, he took two <HI>Algerine Cor&s;airs</HI> on the 10th of <HI>January,</HI> near <HI>Malaga,</HI> whereof one carried 18, and the other 20 Guns, and had on board her 180 <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> 25 <HI>Chri&s;tian Slaves,</HI> and 5 Rene|gadoes. The&s;e Pri&s;es cau&s;ed great alarms at <HI>Algeirs,</HI> where the <HI>Barbarians</HI> gave out, that their lo&s;&s;es in them amounted to the number of 6 or 700 <HI>Turks, Moors</HI> or <HI>Renegadoes,</HI> for which they demanded Re|paration
<PB N="230" REF="121"> of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Con&s;ul. Offering to make &s;atisfaction for their own Ho&s;tilities; to Re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h all things again upon a good Foot, and to break the Treaty Concluded with the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> They promi&s;ed likewi&s;e, they would &s;tay for the Money de&s;igned for the Ran&s;oming of the Dutch Slaves, and demanded earne&s;t for it, thinking it was not yet too late to obtain, a Ratification of the la&s;t Treaty of Peace. But the States being but too well acquainted with the Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, and Incon&s;tancy of tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> were &s;o far from hearkning to them, that they &s;ollicited the Kings of <HI>France, Spain</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> to joyn their Forces with tho&s;e of the United Provinces, to De&s;troy them; &s;ince they exerci&s;ed their Piracies no le&s;s upon the Subjects of tho&s;e Crowns, than upon tho&s;e of the United Provinces. And the States would fain have per&s;waded tho&s;e Powers to have &s;et out three &s;everal Fleets, under the Flagg of each Nation, to go and Be&s;iege their Harbours, Chace them from the Sea, and utterly ruine their abomi|nable and in&s;upportable Domination, without ha|ving any regard to any former Treaty of Peace or Alliance. Which Project &s;eemed very important and well contrived: But yet not one of tho&s;e three Princes could be per&s;waded to hearken to it.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King indeed highly prai&s;ed it, and gave leave to the Dutch to erect Magazines for that effect, both of Provi&s;ions and Ammunition, at <HI>Thoulon,</HI> or <HI>Mar&s;eilles.</HI> The King of <HI>Spain</HI> gave Order, that the Dutch Men of War might have free Ingre&s;s and Egre&s;s in and out of his Ports: And the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> re&s;olved to &s;end a Fleet into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> but it was more, to give new Umbrages than to corre&s;pond with the de&s;ign of the States, and many already could &s;ee in the &s;huffling conduct of that Prince, certain pre|&s;ages of an approaching Rupture of the Peace be|tween him and the United Provinces. For at the &s;ame time that he propo&s;ed to &s;end a Fleet into the
<PB N="231" REF="121"> <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> to act in concert with that of the States, he had on the other &s;ide given private order to Captain <HI>Holms</HI> to &s;ail to the Court of <HI>Africa</HI> to ruin there the Commerce of the Dutch <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> Company, and to &s;eze their &s;hips and Forts. The States therefore &s;eeing there was little Reliance to be made upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any of all tho&s;e Fo|regin Powers, in order to free the Sea from the intolerable Robberies of the <HI>Algerines,</HI> Re&s;olved to concern them&s;elves no further than for the pre|&s;ervation of their own Subjects, by &s;ending ano|ther Fleet into the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> under the Con|duct of <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> becau&s;e Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> had not &s;ufficient Forces to accompli&s;h &s;o great an Enterpri&s;e. That Fleet was compo&s;ed of 12 Ships of War, and one Flute laden with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>They put to Sea about the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> and on the 19th of <HI>June,</HI> arrived in the Road of <HI>Algiers. De Ruiter</HI> pre&s;ently &s;ent notice of his ar|rival to the <HI>Divan,</HI> to remind them to pay him the u&s;ual Honours, and to Congratulate his arrival. But they were &s;o far from acquitting them&s;elves of the Duty he pretended from them, that they refu|&s;ed to let the Dutch Con&s;ul come on board to &s;peak with the Vice-Admiral, and to &s;end Ho&s;tages for the &s;ecurity of the Credential Letters, which were to be pre&s;ented to the <HI>Divan</HI> from the States; for all they would do, was only to Grant a Pa&s;s|port by vertue of which the Commi&s;&s;ioners, <HI>Mortaigne,</HI> and <HI>Reyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ld de Koeverden</HI> went in|to the Town: who in the fir&s;t Audience they had, demand the exchange of Pri&s;oners, and the re|lea&s;e of the <HI>Chri&s;tian Slaves</HI> at the rate they were fir&s;t &s;old for, according to the Conditions of the la&s;t Treaty of Peace, adding that as for other differences, they &s;hould be adju&s;ted by the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to be appointed for that purpo&s;e on each &s;ide. All which was refu&s;ed by the <HI>Divan,</HI> who pretended, before they entered into any Confe|rence about the Relea&s;e of Pri&s;oners, to know
<PB N="232" REF="122"> upon what grounds they might be a&s;&s;ured of a Peace. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> upon that, &s;ent them a Memorial that made a great noi&s;e among&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> becau&s;e they would by no means con&s;ent to any indemnification, nor to the Condition in|&s;i&s;ted upon by the <HI>Dutch</HI> that no free Ship &s;hould be liable to be vi&s;ited, which was the Griev|ance of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> So that that point was hotly di&s;puted on both &s;ides in the <HI>Divan;</HI> But after all, the <HI>Algerines</HI> were ob&s;tinate, and would ab&s;olutely re&s;erve them&s;elves a pow|er, to vi&s;it all <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships, and to declare for Lawful Prize all the effects they found in them to belong to other Nations. In fine, the Con|clu&s;ion of the Negotiation was this, That tho&s;e <HI>Barbarians,</HI> declared to <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> that if he would not accept their propo&s;itions, he would not permit the <HI>Dutch</HI> Con&s;ul to retire on board him, till he had before hand &s;ent on &s;hore 37 <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors</HI> that were Pri&s;oners in his Fleet. Which demand of theirs he thought fit to grant, to prevent the mi&s;chiefs that might o|therwi&s;e happen to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Con&s;ul and his Retinue, of which he had a fre&s;h Example in the Per&s;on of the <HI>English</HI> Con&s;ul whom tho&s;e Pyrates had cruelly handled, after they had bro|ken the Peace with <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>De Ruiter</HI> therefore plainly finding, that it was to no purpo&s;e to u&s;e any gentle methods with them, Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d there was no other way to be taken, but to reduce the <HI>Algerines</HI> to rea&s;on by force of Arms, and accordingly he declared War again&s;t them the 4th. of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, the Fleet unmoored, and went and Anchored on the 7th of the &s;ame Month at <HI>Alicant,</HI> where <HI>de Ruiter</HI> Received a Letter with advice of the new Troubles that Threatned the United Provinces from the <HI>English</HI> and with or|ders to him, to u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e great Prudence and &s;uch Complai&s;ant mea&s;ures with the Ships of War

And accordingly there were no Acts of Ho&s;tility Committed between them at that time, but when the Captains of both Nations met, they Reciprocally &s;aluted one another with &s;ome Guns in a very amicable manner; whil&s;t the main Body of the Engli&s;h Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of 13 &s;ail of Men of War under the Command of Admiral <HI>Law&s;on</HI> kept at the Mouth of the Straits.</P>
<P>Scarcely had <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> begun to ta&s;t of the fruits of Peace which had co&s;t &s;o much Blood to the two Nations, but it was di&s;turbed again by new Ho&s;tilities as the <HI>Dutch</HI> pretend begun by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> out of Jealou&s;ie at the flouri&s;hing Commerce, and great pro&s;pe|rity of the United Provinces, which prepared for <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> who was then bu&s;ie in &s;couring the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI> of the Cor&s;airs, new work in the O|cean, whither Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> was already returned. In the Months of <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> news came to <HI>Holland,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> under the Com|mand of <HI>Robert Holms,</HI> Committed &s;trange de|predations towards the I&s;les of <HI>Cape Verd;</HI> and that in <HI>January</HI> before, they had taken a Ship called the <HI>Spectacles,</HI> and a Yacht, called the <HI>Neptune,</HI> which belonged to the <HI>Dutch We&s;t-India</HI> Company. The <HI>English</HI> Ship that took the <HI>Nep|tune,</HI> the better to deceive tho&s;e &s;he had a mind to attack, put up <HI>Dutch</HI> Colours.

<P>Affairs being in that State, and the <HI>&V;nited Pro|vinces</HI> apprehending that all tho&s;e Squablings would quickly break out into an open War with <HI>England,</HI> began to put all things in order: And it was re|&s;olved in the A&s;&s;embly of the States, That No|tice &s;hould be given to the Ships bound We&s;tward, to go round about <HI>Scotland.</HI> The <HI>Zealanders</HI> like|wi&s;e &s;ent 2 nimble &s;ailing Ships to <HI>Hitland,</HI> to give warning to the Ships belonging to the State, to avoid the Harbours of <HI>England,</HI> to prevent the falling of the Ships, coming back from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> into the Hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> was &s;ent out to Sea with a Fleet of 23 Men of War, to crui&s;e for them, and to &s;ecure their Retreat home.</P>
<P>In the mean while, Mr. <HI>de Goch</HI> &s;et out the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> in Quality of Amba&s;&s;adour from the States, towards the Court of <HI>England,</HI> to endea|vour amicably to appea&s;e and compo&s;e the Diffe|rences that threatned the two Nations with a Rup|ture. He arrived on the 22d at <HI>London,</HI> and was received by the Ma&s;ter of the Ceremonies, with great Marks of Friend&s;hip, and the very &s;ame Evening had Audience of his Maje&s;ty at <HI>White|hall;</HI> and after the u&s;ual Compliments, their Di&s;|cour&s;e fell upon the Affairs that concerned the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Companies, upon which the King, among other Rea&s;ons, told him, <Q>That it was not to be &s;uffered, That the <HI>DutchWe&s;t-India</HI> Company only by the means of a few Forts, and 3 or 4 Ships, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing el&s;ewhere any Country within Land, &s;hould pretend to render the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk</HI> inacce&s;&s;ible to all others, by blocking up the Havens and the Mouths of the Rivers, again&s;t their Commerce, and keeping
<PB N="243" REF="127"> them off, and driving them away from every Place. The Amba&s;&s;adour replied, 'That all the Difficulties about that Affair were terminated by the la&s;t Treaty; and that it ought to be examined whether the <HI>Dutch</HI> had done any thing in contra|vention to it.</Q> After that he made his Complaints of the Ho&s;tile Attempts of Captain <HI>Holms,</HI> in <HI>Guiney:</HI> <Q>To which the King made him the &s;ame An&s;wer he had done before upon the like Subject, That he had not the lea&s;t Knowledge of that, but that as &s;oon as he &s;hould be informed of it, he would act as he found convenient.</Q> After which he begun to &s;peak of the great Naval Preparations that were making in <HI>Holland.</HI> The States Amba&s;|&s;adour ju&s;tified him&s;elf, by an&s;wering, <Q>That tho&s;e Preparations were chiefly for the great Con|voys they were forced to allow their Merchant Ships, for the Security of their Commerce;</Q> pray|ing his Maje&s;ty withal, <Q>That he would plea&s;e to give order, as the States would likewi&s;e do, on their &s;ide, that nothing might pa&s;s between the two Fleets, that might di&s;turb the Peace, or ali|enate the good Corre&s;pondence &s;ettled between the two Nations.</Q> The next day Mr. <HI>de Goch,</HI> had Audience of the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and in the Evening of the Chancellour; in which they di&s;|cour&s;ed of nothing el&s;e but of the great Preparati|ons for War, and of the Affairs of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Companies. Some Time after, the States Amba&s;&s;adour pre&s;ented a Memorial concern|ing the extraordinary Naval Preparations in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and about the Ho&s;tilities committed by Cap|tain <HI>Holms,</HI> and the forbidding of the Importation of <HI>Dutch</HI> Commodities into the Kingdom, under the Pretence of the contagious Di&s;ea&s;e that then reigned in <HI>Holland.</HI> The King an&s;wered very largely to all tho&s;e Points, in Writing; of which the Sub&s;tance was, <Q REND="inline">That he had no De&s;ign his Fleet &s;hould commit any Act of Ho&s;tility; That he had given no Order to Captain <HI>Holms</HI> to &s;ei&s;e
<PB N="244" REF="128"> upon <HI>Cape-Verde,</HI> or any other Forts belonging to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> nor to attempt any thing a|gain&s;t the Subjects of the United Provinces; That they ought to have more confidence in his Roy|al word, than in the Reports of Pilots and Ma|riners, who were very often ill informed: That as what concerned his forbidding the importation of Dutch Commodities, upon the account of the Contagion, he was obliged &s;o to do, for the pre|&s;ervation of his Kingdom, and of the health of his Subjects.</Q></P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>French</HI> King by his Am|ba&s;&s;adors at <HI>London</HI> and the <HI>Hague,</HI> pre&s;ented his Mediation in order to appea&s;e the differences that were ready to kindle a War between tho&s;e two Powers; which the United Provinces agreeably received, but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ngland</HI> refu&s;ed: Which was the cau&s;e, that a little time after the Amba&s;&s;adors of that Crown returned home very ill &s;atisfied. The States laying nothing more to Heart, than the maintenance of Peace, and being very &s;en&s;ible how dear the la&s;t War had co&s;t them, were glad before they engaged them&s;elves in &s;uch ano|ther, to try all means po&s;&s;ible to avert it. For that effect, they writ a Letter to the King of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> to &s;ignifie <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o him, that they had no other Pa&s;&s;ion greater than that to pre&s;erve Peace, hop|ing his Maje&s;ty would be of the &s;ame mind. The King made an&s;wer to the States by another Letter, which was delivered them by the Engli&s;h Amba&s;|&s;ador at his return to the <HI>Hague,</HI> for he had made a &s;tep to <HI>London,</HI> to endeavour to terminate the differences between the two Companies of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI> That Letter was full of prote&s;tations, &s;ignifying the great de&s;ire the King had on his &s;ide, to maintain the Peace; But then returning to the accu&s;tomed complaints, it was ad|ded, that he &s;aw with great regret, that they went not about to give any &s;atisfaction to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for their lo&s;&s;es; and in fine, concluded with
<PB N="245" REF="128"> a prote&s;tation before God and Man, that they would be guilty of all the Inconveniencies, and fatal Con&s;equences that would follow, if a &s;peedy Reparation were not made.</P>
<P>The States, after the reading of that Letter, found well enough, that they were no longer to flatter them&s;elves, the Intention of the Court of <HI>England</HI> being there clearly enough laid open to them, and without mincing of the matter, the King foretold them a part of tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters that were ready to happen. In the mean while the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy was a&s;&s;embling with all diligence in the <HI>Downs,</HI> and about the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> And &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Advice-Yachts that were &s;ent out from time to time, to view and ob&s;erve them were &s;eized: Which confirmed the States in the Re&s;olution to have Recour&s;e to nothing el&s;e but the force of Arms.</P>
<P>Rear-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> being at Sea, as we have &s;aid, to Crui&s;e upon the Watch for the Ships that were expected from the Ea&s;t-<HI>Indies,</HI> had met them in the month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> at <HI>Fairhills</HI> near <HI>Hitland,</HI> and had conducted them into their re&s;pective Ports, without &s;eeing any Engli&s;h by the way. And four Merchant Ships belonging to the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany, Bound for the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guiney</HI> were ready to &s;et &s;ail; but it was not thought fit to let them go without a good Convoy, becau&s;e of the advice they had had, that Prince <HI>Robert</HI> with a Squadron of 18 Men of War, was ready to &s;et out for <HI>Guiney,</HI> whither he was going to fa|vour the depredations the Engli&s;h were making in tho&s;e parts. The States in regard of the Good Services they had received from the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Company in &s;everal occa&s;ions, were re&s;olved to employ their Forces to protect them: And for that end gave order to Captain <HI>Kampen</HI> with a Squadron of 10 Men of War, to Convoy to <HI>Gui|ney</HI> the 4 Ships bound thither belonging to that Company. But becau&s;e they doubted not but that the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> would con&s;true
<PB N="246" REF="129"> that Re&s;olution for a new attempt on their &s;ide to|wards the Breach of a Peace, they &s;ent orders to their Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>London</HI> to pre&s;ent his Maje|&s;ty the following Memorial thereupon.</P>

<P>The Winning of this Battle ought not to be imputed to the Bravery of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;ince the greate&s;t part of the &s;hips they took in it, were delivered them by the Rebellion or Co|wardice of the Seamen, who received in <HI>England</HI> the ju&s;t reward of their infidelity by the mi|&s;eries they were made to &s;uffer there in the Pri|&s;ons. The Action of 85 Villains that &s;urrender|ed to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> the &s;hip <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. is a terrible and abominable Example of it. They were &s;ome Soldiers who in the night of the Battle, joining with &s;ome in&s;olent and &s;editious Seamen &s;eized of all the &s;mall fire Arms, nailed up the
<PB N="277" REF="144"> Cannon, &s;truck their Flag, &s;pread their Sails, tur|ned their Barges and long Boats a drift to the mercy of the Waves, and in that condition wait|ed the approach of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fregat that was in chace of them, to which they Voluntarily yiel|ded them&s;elves, after they had with their drawn hangers and cockt pi&s;tols pre&s;ented to their brea&s;ts forced the Captain and Officers that belonged to the &s;hip, who would have oppo&s;ed them, to remain in &s;ilence, under pain of death, and to be &s;pectators of &s;o dete&s;table an Action without during to &s;peak a word. The men of the &s;hips <HI>Helver&s;um</HI> and <HI>Nagelboom,</HI> as al&s;o &s;ome Officers of the Fleet, of whom we &s;hall &s;peak more amply afterwards, did the like without ha|ving any regard neither to their honour, nor to the allegiance they had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn to their Country.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> (as the <HI>Dutch</HI> would have been in the &s;ame ca&s;e, and as they affected to do afterwards, upon le&s;s occa&s;ions of Bragging than this,) being proud of all the&s;e advantages, failed not to publi&s;h them with all the glorious Circum&s;tances imaginable. They Rung the Bells and made Bonfires every where, and put every thing el&s;e in practice that might tend to add &s;plendor and renown to the Memory of &s;o great a Triumph. 1500 <HI>Dutch</HI> Pri&s;oners were carri|ed to <HI>Colchester;</HI> and it may well be judged by &s;o great a Number what cruel and ba&s;e Co|wardice the Captains were guilty of, who cho&s;e rather &s;hamefully to leave their Companions ex|po&s;ed to the Flames, or to a Lamentable &s;hip|wrack and drowning, than to venture to &s;natch them from the devouring Jaws of death, by re|ceiving them on board them when they fled, &s;o that they mu&s;t have peri&s;h'd, if their Enemies had not taken more Compa&s;&s;ion of them then their own unnatural Officers. Among&s;t tho&s;e per|&s;ons there was a Woman named <HI>Willemite Ger|rets</HI>
<PB N="278" REF="145"> a Native of <HI>Embden,</HI> that had performed the function of Gunner in the &s;hip <HI>Mar&s;&s;eveen,</HI> who being di&s;covered, was relea&s;ed and &s;et at liberty by King <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;econd for the ra|rity of the adventure.

<P>Before we pa&s;s, any further, we will report here &s;ome remarkable Circum&s;tances relating to this fight.</P>
<P>The States after the Battle, being willing to provide again&s;t all Events had &s;ent Orders to the Fleet to keep the Sea, tho' they had had the wor&s;t, as well to &s;upport the Reputation of their Arms, as to le&s;&s;en the Glory of the Victors, that would have made that retreat pa&s;s for a total defeat. And for that effect, Mr. <HI>Wit&s;en, &V;rybergen,</HI> and <HI>Schrick</HI> being &s;ent to the <HI>Texel,</HI> in Quality of Deputies from the States, went out of the Port, and &s;ent for Vice-Admi|ral <HI>Tromp</HI> on board them giving him Order to keep the Fleet out at Sea, and not to &s;uffer it to enter into any Harbours. But <HI>Tromp</HI> being griev|ed at the di&s;a&s;ters that had newly hapned by the Ba&s;ene&s;s and Cowardice of the Officers and Soldiers of the Fleet, and his heart being ready to bur&s;t with indignation at them, could not for|bear An&s;wering, the Deputies that he could not execute their orders with men that had &s;o ba&s;e|ly de&s;erted him in time of danger, and upon who&s;e Courage or Fidelity &s;o little reli|ance could be made. So that without minding the Orders of the Deputies, the Fleet under the Conduct of <HI>Tromp</HI> and <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z</HI> entred into port, being in all about 60 Men of War, of which the mo&s;t part were but little endama|ged. Admiral <HI>Wa&s;&s;enaar,</HI> or <HI>Opdam</HI>'s &s;hip, was,

The &s;hips that were &s;till in the <HI>Texel</HI> were 58 in Number, 7 that had &s;taid behind in the Road and 2 unmoor'd that were put in before. They had advice that 18 were in the Port of the <HI>Vlie,</HI> and 16 or 17 in the <HI>Meu&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> So that they found none were mi&s;&s;ing but tho&s;e we have &s;et down, of all the whole Fleet.</P>
<P>In the mean while however, the murmurings of the People that were ill &s;atisfied at the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the Battle and the Conduct of the Ge|nerals, were grown to an extream height, and al|ready begun to threaten mi&s;chievous Con&s;equen|ces. The fir&s;t &s;parks of them begun to appear at the <HI>Brill,</HI> where <HI>John Evert&s;z</HI> of <HI>Zealand</HI> had like to have lo&s;t his life. For being come with his Ship into the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> and Landing at the <HI>Brill,</HI> at his arrival the <HI>Mobb</HI> that judge of things always by the &s;ucce&s;s, laid all the blame upon him, and imputing to him a great part of all the misfortunes that had hapned and accu&s;ing him of Cowardice, threw him into the Water, where he would certainly have been drown'd if he had not been re&s;cued from the People by a good Number of Soldiers.

<P>A little while after the Criminals had been &s;o pu|ni&s;ht, and the merit and valour of tho&s;e that had &s;ig|nalized them&s;elves been rewarded, <HI>viz.</HI> on the 23d of <HI>July,</HI> Vice Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> was elected Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> in the place of the Decea&s;ed <HI>Kortenaar</HI> in ac|knowledgment of the eminent Bravery he had &s;hewn in the la&s;t Battel. His advancement to that Office, rekindled a fre&s;h the before damped zeal of the Seamen who te&s;tified an extraordinary joy at it, by rea&s;on of the extreme affection they bore him, which equall'd that they always had for his Father.</P>
<PB N="287" REF="150">
<P>In the mean while, the States being intent upon con&s;ulting the means how to repair the ill &s;ucce&s;s of their Arms, by new Forces, gave orders for working with all po&s;&s;ible diligence in all the Pro|vinces near the Sea, to fit up the Fleet again, and put it in a good Condition, and that &s;o much the more pre&s;tingly, becau&s;e they knew the Eng|li&s;h Fleet was cru&s;ing in the Channel, to watch for <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s return, which was daily expected. After the Death of Mr. <HI>Opdam,</HI> they were much puzled about the choice of a per&s;on fit to be in|tru&s;ted with the chief Command of their Fleet. Many of them ca&s;t their Eyes upon Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> but the ob&s;tinacy he had &s;hewn again&s;t the Orders of the Deputies, when in&s;tead of keeping the Fleet out at Sea after the defeat, as they had Commanded, he made it go into the <HI>Texel,</HI> gave grounds for &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding, and cau&s;ed a great many murmurings to ari&s;e, to the di&s;advantage of his reputation. Yet on the other &s;ide, they put great confidence in his un|daunted Courage, and in the &s;ingular affection the Seamen had for him; but tho&s;e good thoughts were again over balanced by the &s;u&s;picions &s;ome predominant Members of the States of <HI>Holland</HI> then ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> conceived of his Conduct, becau&s;e that being pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to the intere&s;t of the then ungratefully contemned Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> then excluded from all great Employments, tho&s;e In&s;olent and Ambitious States-men were afraid the inclination he had for that Prince, might over-&s;way him again&s;t that Obedience he owed to tho&s;e Ma&s;ters who he knew had u&s;urped from him his Rights. But however, the mo&s;t judicious among them conte&s;ted again&s;t all tho&s;e &s;eeming &s;pecious rea&s;ons, with more &s;olid proofs drawn from his incomparable great Worth and Merit, not &s;tick|ing to &s;ay without bogling, that they could not well chu&s;e another to that high Preferment without doing him inju&s;tice. At length after many debates
<PB N="288" REF="151"> and contrary Opinions thereupon, they re&s;olved by common con&s;ent to confer upon him that great Employment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI> cho|&s;en Admi|ral in chief upon cer|tain con|ditions.</NOTE> but yet with the&s;e Conditions, that there &s;hould be three Deputies of the States ap|pointed to go along with him, with full Power over the Fleet, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Huiens,</HI> Deputy of the A&s;&s;embly of the States General for the Province of <HI>Guelders,</HI> Mr. <HI>De Wit</HI> Pen&s;ionary of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Frie&s;land,</HI> that noted enemy to the <HI>Orangian</HI> Family, and Mr. <HI>Borreel,</HI> Burger Ma&s;ter of <HI>Middleburg.</HI></P>
<P>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> being thus promo|ted to the chief Command of the Fleet, applied him&s;elf with all imaginable care to fill up with all &s;peed the Compliment of Sea-men needful for the effectual manning out the Fleet, that it might be ready to put to Sea again a&s;&s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.

Captain <HI>Vander Zaan</HI> Commanded the Seamen and Count <HI>Hoorn,</HI> the Soldiers. And &s;o they Landed their Men in good order, to attack the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cor|mantine.</HI> As &s;oon as we were Landed the <HI>English</HI> blew up the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Anamabo,</HI> which encoura|ged us extreamly; But alas, tho&s;e happy be|ginings had not the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;&s;es afterwards; For at our approach to <HI>Adia,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> on the one &s;ide, and the <HI>Negroes</HI> on the other, that in great Numbers appeared on the Coa&s;t, charged us &s;o vigorou&s;ly from their Lodges and Retrenchments, by continually firing upon us both with great and &s;mall &s;hot, whil&s;t on the other &s;ide, the Ca&s;tle likewi&s;e thundred upon us with their Cannon that many of our <HI>Indi|ans Canoes</HI> were &s;unk thereby, and we forced to retreat with lo&s;s back to our Ships: That day we made no other attack, but obliged our <HI>Negroes</HI> to retire on board with us, with de|&s;ign the next day to make a fre&s;h A&s;&s;ault, as we did with more &s;ucce&s;s. For in the Night &s;ome of the principal of the <HI>English Negroes</HI> came on board Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> promi&s;ing him to let us Land without oppo&s;ition. In an&s;wer to which welcome proffer we made them a pre&s;ent of a Tun of Brandy, and &s;ome gla&s;|&s;es &s;uch as the <HI>Negroes</HI> u&s;e; after which, they retired. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> ob&s;erving the good di&s;|po&s;ition they were in towards us, Re&s;olved to make his be&s;t advantage of it, and accordingly without lo&s;ing time, ordered a &s;econd de&s;cent
<PB N="295" REF="154"> to be made. Our Whites inclu&s;ively with their Officers were 750 Men, and our Blacks 500. The <HI>Negroes</HI> that held intelligence with us put up the Princes Colours upon the Ruines of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Anamabo</HI> which had been blown up a little before, &s;o that we Landed without any re&s;i&s;tance from the <HI>Negroes,</HI> but yet not without a great deal of danger by rea&s;on of the Roughne&s;s of the Sea. About noon we began to come near the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cormantine,</HI> whil&s;t &s;ome of our Ships getting in a line under the Ca&s;tle as near it as po&s;&s;ibly they could, play'd hotly upon it with their Guns, and battered it to ruin with much &s;ucce&s;s. In the mean while our men marching up in a clo&s;e body to the <HI>Negroes</HI> that held &s;till for the <HI>English</HI> put them to the Rout, and forced them to Retire back towards their Commander named <HI>John Gabia,</HI> who having rai&s;ed a Battery of 3 great Guns upon a hill, galled us extreamly; But our Troops de&s;pi&s;ing that danger forced them at length to retire and leave their Cannon be|hind them, and advanced ju&s;t under the Ca|&s;tle. Our <HI>Negroes</HI> likewi&s;e fought with much bravery, &s;et fire on the <HI>English Negroes</HI> Lod|ges, and cut off the heads of as many of them as they could catch, and carried them away with them, leaving their Bodies in the Field of Battle, becau&s;e we had promi&s;ed them a fixt Reward for every Head; but &s;everal of our Negroes were likewi&s;e killed and wounded. As &s;oon as they in the Ca&s;tle per|ceived what Progre&s;s we had made, they put up a white Flag, and demanded Quarter, &s;o that we made our &s;elves Ma&s;ters of it with little Lo&s;s. It was defended with 32 Pieces of Cannon, and a Garri&s;on of 52 Men. The General of the Ne|groes, above-mentioned, having &s;everal times &s;o|licited the Governour to blow up the Ca&s;tle, and being refu&s;ed, was &s;o enraged at it, that he cut
<PB N="296" REF="155"> two of his Childrens, and two of his Nephews Throats, and then &s;tabbing him&s;elf &s;everal times into the Throat and Belly, he threw him&s;elf down from the Walls of the Ca&s;tle, which not killing him out-right, he crept behind a Rock, and was there found dead. We gave Quarter to the <HI>En|gli&s;h:</HI> After which, our Officers placed good Guards every where, and the better to prevent any In&s;olences that might happen from the Soldi|ers, they forbad them all &s;orts of &s;trong Drink. But the next Day, as our Barges drew near the Shore, to take in our Men, an infinite Number of <HI>Negroes</HI> flockt together, from all pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ts about the Ca&s;tle, and flew fiercely upon all that offered to &s;tir out of it, cutting off the Heads of all that re&s;i&s;ted them, without any further Ceremony; &s;o that we lo&s;t more Men that way than we had done in the A&s;&s;ault. But our Men thereupon fir|ing the Ca&s;tle Guns upon them, killed and wound|ed a great many Negroes, and put the re&s;t to Flight; which &s;o terrified them, that a little while after, the General of the Negroes appear|ed before the Ca&s;tle, with a white Flag, demand|ing Peace, and free Commerce, which being granted them, they retired. And then all our Men, but what were to be left in Garri&s;on, re|turned again on Board the Fleet. One <HI>Samuel Smith,</HI> of <HI>Gravenweert,</HI> a native of <HI>Guelderland,</HI> and Merchant of <HI>Morea,</HI> was cho&s;en Governour of the new-taken Ca&s;tle. And then, in mark of our Victory, all the Guns were di&s;charged both from the Ca&s;tle and the Men of War. On the 12th of <HI>February</HI> we unmoored from thence, and on the 13th came to an Anchor before the Ca&s;tle <HI>del Mina;</HI> where we were well received; &s;o that after we had &s;et all things in order there, put on Board the Che&s;ts of Gold, and taken in a Provi&s;ion of fre&s;h Water, we &s;et &s;ail the 27th of <HI>February,</HI> 1665. tacking about to the South-ward.

<PB N="297" REF="155"> Line,</HI> and on the third of <HI>April,</HI> in the Morning, the Wind being ri&s;en higher, we re|pa&s;&s;ed it again. On the 6th of the &s;ame Month Captain <HI>Byland</HI> died&punc; and the next Day his Body was committed to the Deep, in the Latitude of 1 degree and 4 minutes. On the 30th of <HI>April,</HI> about Noon, we arrived before the I&s;land of the <HI>Barbados,</HI> where we found 40 <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> which we forced a&s;hore, after &s;ome Hours firing upon them. We likewi&s;e fired &s;o hotly upon the Ca&s;tle, that we beat down the Walls, and forced the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to run away in Troops. However, the Seamen belonging to the <HI>English</HI> Ships, making at fir&s;t &s;ome Re&s;i&s;tance, we had &s;ome Men killed and wounded on our &s;ide; but when we made up towards them, to grapple them, we had like to have run aground, which obliged us to &s;heer off further from the Coa&s;t, and then we ca&s;t An|chor; yet we continued to fire without Interrup|tion, upon them, till we &s;hattered them all to pieces. From thence we &s;ailed away to <HI>Martini|co,</HI> where we buried our dead Men: And after we had paid tho&s;e la&s;t Honours to them, we &s;et &s;ail again, and took divers Prizes in the I&s;lands of <HI>Montferrat, Nevis,</HI> and <HI>Guadaloupe;</HI> forcing them every where to flie under the Shelter of their Ca&s;tles. Some we burnt, and &s;ome we &s;old at <HI>S. Martins</HI> and <HI>S. Chri&s;tophers</HI> I&s;lands, and the re&s;t, that &s;ailed well, we carried home with us. The 15th of <HI>June</HI> we arrived before <HI>Newfound|land,</HI> where we took 8 Prizes more, &s;eizing on their Merchandi&s;es and Effects, but burning the Ships. We found there abundance of Salt Cod, and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bread; which came very oppor|tunely to us. And then unmooring, we &s;et &s;ail again.

<P>And the Intention of the States was accordingly executed; but <HI>Tromp,</HI> whether he came to him|&s;elf of his own accord, or were over-per&s;uaded to it by his Friends, conformed to the Will and Plea|&s;ure of the States.</P>
<P>In the mean while there aro&s;e a great Commo|motion among the Seamen of Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Ship, about weighing Anchor, which they refu&s;ed to do, but in the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>'s Name: And their In&s;olence tran&s;ported them &s;o far, as to rebel again&s;t their Officers, who made a &s;hift to appea&s;e them for a while, with gentle Words; but the Tumult began again &s;oon after afre&s;h, when the Cook came to &s;erve them out their Victuals: For not being content with what was given them, they ran with their Porringers, to the Captain's

For that effect, two Bills were put into a Di&s;h, cover|ed with a Napkin, whereof one had in it the figure of a Gallows, and the other was a Blank, and they being made to draw for their Lives, he that drew the Gal|lows was hanged on the Main Yard, and the other was whipt, markt with the States Arms, and then turned a&s;hore, as unworthy to &s;erve any more.</P>
<P>3 Days after, being the 14th of the Month, a great part of the Fleet put out to Sea, and the Day after the re&s;t followed them, to which the indefatigable Care of Mr. Pen&s;ionary <HI>de Wit</HI> did not a little con|tribute, by the &s;ingular Pains he took to &s;ee all the Parts of the <HI>Texel</HI> &s;ounded, through which they were to pa&s;s; where he found in &s;ome Places 4 Foot of Water more than the Sounders ever found before, which in all likelihood happened by their Carele&s;ne&s;s, &s;o that it was thought not im|po&s;&s;ible to get out at 28 Points of the Compa&s;s.

<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> having had advice, that we were arrived here with a Fleet of 10 &s;hips from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> were in an unconceivable vexa|tion at it; &s;o that the day before ye&s;terday they came and po&s;ted them&s;elves between the two Ca&s;tles that defend the entrance of the Port, with a Squadron of 14 Men of War, 3 Fire-&s;hips, and 4 Advice Yachts, making in all 21 &s;ail, and fell upon our Fleet with &s;o much fury, that we were forced to &s;tand up in our own defence, and by the help of the Ca&s;tles, and of &s;ome batteries we had rai&s;ed on &s;hore again&s;t them with Guns drawn out of our &s;hips we repul&s;ed them with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that after a fight of about 3 hours and a half, they were forced to cut their Cables, and &s;hamefully betake them&s;elves to flight. We are told for certain, that whil&s;t they were retreating 3 of their Ships &s;unk, whereof one carried an Ad|mirals Flag. It appears by the marks of their defeat, that they were very &s;everely handled, &s;ince 30 of their dead men were ca&s;t a&s;hore by the Waves, who were &s;trip'd by the Inhabi|tants, and 6 of their &s;hips were &s;o battered, that they were forced to Anchor, at about 3 miles from hence, to patch them&s;elves up again as well as they could, being able no longer to keep the Sea.</P>
<P>We had in this fight 25 men killed, and 70 wounded; and we lo&s;t the Merchant, Mr. <HI>Pe|ter de Sandvlied,</HI> after he had &s;hewn a great
<PB N="311" REF="162"> deal of Bravery. The Ma&s;ts, Sails and Rig|ging of our &s;hips are extreamely endamaged, &s;o that they will take us up &s;everal days time to repair them. We have rea&s;on to thank God for having &s;o powerfully protected us. A Merchant &s;hip of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> Commanded by the Ma&s;ter <HI>Ruth Maximilian,</HI> fought valiantly af|ter the Example of our men, and &s;o did General <HI>Alefelt,</HI> and the Governour <HI>Van Steignon,</HI> who after he had done all he could to divert the <HI>English</HI> from their de&s;ign by fair words, with|out any effect, have at la&s;t by the force of their Arms, and the powerfull Rhetorick of the Cannon of their Ca&s;tles, maintained their rights, and the Protection they had granted to &s;trangers, &s;o that all things &s;ucceeded to the honour of the Victors. Three Months pay Extraordina|ry was granted on this occa&s;ion both to the Sea|men of our &s;hips, as of tho&s;e of the Merchants, by way of reward for their good Service, who were employed either on board our &s;hips, or el&s;e on &s;hore in managing the Batteries there erected for our defence; which is to be paid by all the &s;hips which are here and we hope you will not take that proceeding ill from us, &s;ince it was put in practice only to rai&s;e the Courage of the men in that pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, and to in|cite them the more vigorou&s;ly to repul&s;e a bold and potent Enemy who came with a greedy and eager Appetite, to &s;eize upon &s;o much riches, the lo&s;s of which would have been very heavi|ly &s;en&s;ible to you. The bearer of the&s;e di&s;|patches can inform you more fully of the other Circum&s;tances of this Fight, becau&s;e he was an Eye-Witne&s;s of all that pa&s;&s;ed in it. Up|on the Advice we have had from &s;everal Per&s;ons, that pa&s;t la&s;t <HI>Sunday</HI> near the Enemies Fleet, about 20 miles to the We&s;tward of <HI>Schuitenes,</HI> we thought we had &s;ome rea&s;on to fear, they would attempt a &s;econd charge upon us; which
<PB N="312" REF="163"> makes us put in practice all things that may tend to &s;ecure our pre&s;ervation; having for that effect, pray'd the Governour to Order the Barrier to be repaired that &s;huts up the Port, that &s;o being &s;hut up, we may be in &s;afe &s;hel|ter from Fire-&s;hips. We al&s;o have intreated him to repair the works and Batteries, and put them into a better condition, as likewi&s;e to cau&s;e &s;ome new works to be rai&s;ed in convenient pla|ces, to plant Cannon upon. And he has a&s;&s;u|red us, he will take care to have all things done that may contribute to the &s;ecurity of the Ha|vens of the King his Ma&s;ter; that we are at pre&s;ent bu&s;ied in tran&s;porting to &s;hore 20 peices of Cannon out of our &s;hips and 10 more out of the Merchants &s;hips, which we can very well &s;pare by rea&s;on of the &s;mallne&s;s of the Port, to be employed there in our defence; we will likewi&s;e endeavour to make a Fire-&s;hip if we can per&s;wade one of our Merchants to give us his &s;hip for that u&s;e. All things being &s;o Ordered, we hope under the Protection of God &s;ufficiently to provide for the &s;ecurity of &s;o rich a Booty as that intru&s;ted with us, by vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ing the attacks of the <HI>English</HI> in which we implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ble&s;&s;ing of God; and we promi&s;e on our part to contri|bute thereto with all that &s;hall lie in our pow|er, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>English</HI> lo&s;t in that attack, 2 Captains, with one of <HI>Mountague</HI>'s Sons, and 3 men of War, whereof one &s;tuck in the Rocks, out of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> took the Guns, to employ them in their own defence. And the Wooden Po&s;ts that formed the Barrier of the Haven were Re|implaced in Order to &s;ecure the Fleet from the <HI>English</HI> Fire-&s;hips. But they dur&s;t not venture upon another charge, but tackt about towards their main Fleet, quitting the Rocks of <HI>Norway</HI> to
<PB N="313" REF="163"> make the be&s;t of their way towards their own Country: And &s;o by that means the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hips that were pregnant with immen&s;e Riches, the &s;hips alone that came from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> being valu|ed at above 12 Millions of Livers, or one Mil|lion Sterling, were delivered from the di&s;a&s;ters, that threatned them. When Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> was arrived in the Fleet, as we have &s;aid, it was thought fit, by the Advice of all the re&s;t of the General Officers, that the States Deputies and Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> &s;hould remove out of the &s;hip <HI>Amity,</HI> into the <HI>Delfland,</HI> called for|merly, the <HI>Great Spaniard,</HI> and that each Squa|dron of the Fleet &s;hould make a detachment of 7 Frigats, or bigger Men of War, with &s;ome Fire-&s;hips, to form a 4th. Squadron for Admi|ral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> who had to Command it under him, <HI>Aart Van Nes,</HI> Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Frederick Staghouwer,</HI> Rear-Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the North. They likewi&s;e regulated the placing of the Flags, or|dering, that Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadron &s;hould bear it on their main ma&s;t; that of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z,</HI> on their mizzen-ma&s;t, the Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> on the Poop, and that of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tierk Hiddes,</HI> on the Fore ma&s;t.</P>
<P>All the World begun already to conceive great Hopes of &s;o formidable a Fleet, commanded by 2 of the greate&s;t men of the Age, and directed by the Council of the wi&s;e&s;t Deputies of the State.</P>
<P>Things being in that Condition, there Re|mained nothing but to form &s;ome Noble Enter|prize that might rai&s;e the Glory of the Chief|tains, and the Courage of the Seamen that was pall'd by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the la&s;t fight. And accordingly the Deputies, and Admiral <HI>de Rui|ter</HI> with the re&s;t of the General Officers of the Fleet Re&s;olved to &s;ail towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Scotland,</HI> as thinking they might meet

That project &s;eemed well contrived, but a contrary Wind hindred the exe|cution of it, for growing more boi&s;terous and turning quite oppo&s;ite again&s;t them, it was im|po&s;&s;ible for the Fleet to &s;teer to the North-ward; which at the &s;ame time favoured the retreat of the <HI>English.</HI> On the 25th. of the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Advanc'd guard of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet having pur&s;ued two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Advice Yachts, took them, and by their means were informed, that the <HI>English</HI> Fleet con&s;i&s;ting of a|bout 70 &s;ail of Men of War, had been cruiz|ing &s;ome days upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> to hunt after the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;hips; but that af|terwards pur&s;uing their cour&s;e on the 18th. to|wards <HI>Hitland,</HI> they came to an Anchor in the bay of <HI>Breezond,</HI> having left upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Norway</HI> a Squadron of 20 &s;hips under the Com|mand of Captain <HI>Tyddeman;</HI> and that on the 23d. having unmoored from <HI>Hitland,</HI> they put out to Sea again. On the 25th. of the &s;ame Month, the Advanced guard of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet di&s;covered an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> man of War of the white Squadron, &s;o that they found by that, the two Fleets were pretty near one another, yet with|out being able to &s;ee one another, or to di&s;co|ver what cour&s;e each other &s;teer'd. During the&s;e tran&s;actions, the <HI>Dutch</HI> re&s;olved to &s;ail with all po&s;&s;ible diligence towards <HI>Bergen,</HI> in hopes to meet and maul the &s;mall <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Squadron in tho&s;e parts; and accordingly on the 29th. the <HI>Hol|land</HI> Fleet arrived upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Norway,</HI> and heard there by the report of &s;ome Galliots, that the <HI>English</HI> had attack the <HI>Dutch</HI> homeward bound <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> &s;hips in the Port of <HI>Bergen,</HI> as likewi&s;e other <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant &s;hips that were

<P>In the mean time the States Deputies received a Letter from Captain <HI>Bitter</HI> that Commanded in chief the Ea&s;t-<HI>India</HI> &s;hips; who &s;ignified to them, that &s;ince the fight with the <HI>English,</HI> things there went very &s;trangely: For that Mr. <HI>Ale|felt</HI> or <HI>Aleveld,</HI> General of the <HI>Danish</HI> Troops in <HI>Norway,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Steignon,</HI> Governour of the Town and Ca&s;tles of <HI>Bergen,</HI> who told the <HI>Dutch</HI> very roundly, that if they expected they &s;hould continue their care to protect them from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>English,</HI> they mu&s;t pay them down on the nail the &s;um of 100000 Crowns to &s;atisfie them and the re&s;t of the Officers and Soldiers for the pains and hazard they had been at in their defence; and that when they &s;hould have received that money, they would be ready to &s;acrifice their Lives and E&s;tates again&s;t all that &s;hould attempt upon the liberty of their Harbours adding, that for the love they had to the United Provinces, they would act freely with them and without any manner of di&s;&s;imula|tion; That the <HI>English</HI> from whom they had much more advantageous Offers, if they would accept them, were but two or three miles from <HI>Ber|gen:</HI> And that the account they were to render to the King their Ma&s;ter about ob&s;erving a Neu|trality was not the lea&s;t bar to them in that ca&s;e; that therefore they expected the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hould immediately &s;atisfie their demand in ready ca&s;h or upon their default, they knew where to fur|ni&s;h them&s;elves, and in two days time would ob|lige them to make a &s;erious reflection upon the premi&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Bitter</HI> added, that he had an&s;wered them that the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants there were not in a con|dition out of their own Money to pay &s;o con|&s;iderable a &s;um; that a recompence of &s;uch a value as that was the concern of the State a|lone, and that no private Per&s;on ought to med|dle with it. However he told his Ma&s;ters that he had endeavoured to drill on the affair with them to what length he could, by paying them 3000 Crowns in hand, and that they were ma|king a Collection of 8 or 10000 Crowns more among&s;t the Merchant men come from <HI>Spain,</HI> which &s;um was to be imployed in fortifying the Ca&s;tle where a great many men were already at work for that effect, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The States had named Lieutenant Colonel <HI>de Gent,</HI> the Colonels <HI>Dolman,</HI> and <HI>Maregnault</HI> the Lieutenant Colonel <HI>de Santen,</HI> and Serjeant Ma|jor <HI>Wynbergen,</HI> to Command the Troops on board their Fleet.

Mr. <HI>de Gent</HI> was accordingly re|ceived by the Governour with great marks of re&s;pect: Upon which the Deputies having &s;ome reliance, writ to <HI>Bitter</HI> to u&s;e all the diligence he could to get the Ships out of that Port, as being per&s;waded the <HI>Danes</HI> would not offer to oppo&s;e their going; but withal a&s;&s;uring him, that if he feared they would make any difficulty to let them quietly depart, that they might expect all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance imaginable from the powerfull Fleet that was &s;o near at hand, at their di&s;po&s;al. But
<PB N="317" REF="165"> alas the very noi&s;e alone of the arrival of that Fleet upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Norway,</HI> made Affairs there change face immediately, and after that the <HI>Dutch</HI> heard no more from the <HI>Danes</HI> of their demand of 100000 Crowns.

<P>After the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> and other Merchant &s;hips had joyned the Grand Fleet of men of War, they unmoor'd from the Bay of <HI>Bergen,</HI> at the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> and about 4 days after were &s;aluted by &s;o terrible a Tempe&s;t that they were almo&s;t all entirely &s;cattered one from an|other. And be&s;ides the lo&s;s of two Fire-Ships that were ca&s;t away, there were many Ships &s;hrewdly endamaged. Two <HI>East-India</HI> Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Golden Phoenix,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Hu|ningen,</HI> and 4 men of War, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>We&s;t-Frie&s;|land,</HI> the <HI>Groningen,</HI> the <HI>De Zevenwolden,</HI> and the <HI>Hope,</HI> being &s;eparated from the Admiral's Flag, by the ill Weather, fell into the hands of the <HI>English</HI> near the Dogger-Sand.

<P>Thus the <HI>English</HI> retired into their Harbours, laden with the Spoils of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> In which Tran&s;action, it &s;eems &s;omething &s;trange, the two Fleets &s;hould come &s;o near one another with|out fighting, &s;ince their Vanguards were &s;ometimes near enough to have engaged; but it is thought the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> intended nothing le&s;s than a Fight, when they &s;aw &s;o fair an Occa&s;ion to make a Rich Booty without it.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the <HI>Dutch</HI> u&s;ed all imagina|ble Indu&s;try, to a&s;&s;emble their Fleet before <HI>Goree,</HI> and to get them in readine&s;s to go out once more in &s;earch after the <HI>English,</HI> and to engage them, if po&s;&s;ible, to a Battle.

But however, <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> in &s;pite of all tho&s;e cro&s;s and mi&s;chievous Acci|dents, unmoored on the 5th of <HI>October</HI> following, from before <HI>Goree,</HI> to go into the <HI>Texel,</HI> and joyn
<PB N="320" REF="167"> the other fre&s;h Ships there, with De&s;ign after he had taken in a Supply of nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions, to &s;ail out with them towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England.</HI> And on the 11th the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of about 90 Sail of Men of War, weighed Anchor, with a Re&s;olution, to go and attack the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> at <HI>Solbay,</HI> at <HI>Harwich,</HI> in the <HI>Thames,</HI> or in the <HI>Downs;</HI> for which effect, the States Deputies had taken care to detach away &s;ome Yachts and Galliots, to go out a &s;couting towards tho&s;e Pla|ces, and to get what Intelligence they could of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to &s;pie out the Number of their Ships. And one of tho&s;e Yachts and a Galliot, being re|turned, met the Grand Fleet on the 12th off of <HI>Schoowen,</HI> and reported, They had &s;een 23 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships behind the Banks of <HI>Harwich,</HI> and that &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Fi&s;hermen had a&s;&s;ured them, The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet was not yet come out. Relying upon that Report, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> appeared on the 15th be|tween <HI>Yarmouth</HI> and <HI>Lay&s;toff,</HI> where they took a &s;mall Bark, and enquiring of the Pri&s;oners taken in it, how all things &s;tood, they an&s;wered, That they knew nothing but only that the great <HI>English</HI> Men of War had orders not to &s;tir out, and that there were none at all on the Northern Coa&s;ts; that the la&s;t week before there died in <HI>London</HI> 9000 People of the Plague, and that &s;everal other great Towns in the Kingdom were afflicted with the &s;ame pernicious Di&s;ea&s;e. The next Day, the Fleet ad|vanced towards <HI>Solbay,</HI> where they found no Ships at all. In the mean while, all the Coa&s;t was in an alarm; and the People of <HI>Suffolk</HI> were up in Arms, and had fired the Beacons all-a-long the Sea-Coa&s;t, to give notice to the Inhabitants, that the Enemy was upon their Coa&s;t. On the &s;ame Day, 16 of the King's Ships having had notice of the Approach of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, unmoored from <HI>Harwich,</HI> and retired into the <HI>Thames.</HI> On the 17th the <HI>Dutch</HI> were re&s;olved to make &s;ail towards <HI>Har|wich,</HI> acro&s;s the Banks, but were hindred by a
<PB N="321" REF="167"> contrary Wind; and therefore &s;teered towards the <HI>Thames,</HI> where they &s;aw 13 <HI>English</HI> Men of War go in, which they could not po&s;&s;ibly inter|cept, becau&s;e our Men were near 3 Miles off from the Body of the Grand Fleet. It was &s;uppo&s;ed, they were the Ships that were come from <HI>Harwich.</HI> The next night, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet anchored at the Mouth of the River, and on the 18th they unmoor|ed, and made off for the <HI>Downs,</HI> thinking to block up the Pa&s;&s;age thither, and to &s;urprize the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships they &s;hould find there. But that Project was broken either by contrary Winds, or Calms, if it had not been for which they might have taken 5 <HI>English</HI> Men of War and 3 or 4 Privateers, who by that means had time to e&s;cape. However, the Fleet returned again to the <HI>Thames;</HI> and on the la&s;t Day of the Month, the Lords Deputies, with the Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> went on Board the Frigat <HI>Gornichem,</HI> and with 3 Galliots accompanying them, advanced a great way up the River, follow|ed at a di&s;tance by <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s and <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Squa|drons. About a mile from thence they found the River very large and deep, and the next evening after they had taken a View of all things, they re|turned to the Fleet. But all tho&s;e Precautions were but needle&s;s, becau&s;e they were founded only upon the Advice they had had, that an <HI>English</HI> Fleet, to the Number of about 60 Sail, of &s;tout Men of War, was ready to &s;ail out of the <HI>Thames,</HI> with intent to give Battle to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and cha&s;e them from the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England;</HI> which proved fal&s;e, for they offered not to &s;tir out.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Winter</HI> was coming on, and Mortal Di&s;ea&s;es began cruelly to rage in the Fleet; where 140 Seamen were already dead, 355 had been &s;ent back &s;ick into <HI>Holland,</HI> and there were reckoned 970 more to remain &s;till in the Fleet. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> had 34 Sick on board him, be&s;ides 33 more he had &s;ent home before. On the 1&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> all the General and In|ferior
<PB N="322" REF="168"> Officers in the Fleet were &s;ummoned on Board the Admiral, to give him a more particular account what condition they were in, by who&s;e Report it appeared, That &s;ome Captains who had all their Men healthy and &s;ound, but on the 27th of the la&s;t Month, complained, that &s;ince that time they had had one with another 40 Men apiece &s;ick on board them. And Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> was one of the mo&s;t unfortunate in that Rencounter, having in two days time 50 Soldiers taken &s;ick in his Ship alone. Vice-Admiral <HI>Ban|kert</HI> reported likewi&s;e, That the Day before 20 of his Men had had the &s;ame Misfortune. So that every Captain complaining in that manner of the number of &s;ick Men they had on Board their re|&s;pective Ships, the Deputies, and the Generals of the Fleet, judged thereupon, That it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to remedy tho&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters, and that therefore it was be&s;t for them to retire home, and that &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> appeared not at Sea, and that the Tempe&s;tuous Weather, that coming on with the <HI>Winter,</HI> would not permit them to &s;tay any longer there. Pur&s;uant to which Re&s;olu|tion, 6 light Frigats, and 4 Galliots were detach|ed away to go and crui&s;e for 3 Days at the Mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> both to adverti&s;e the Ships that might have been &s;ent from <HI>Holland</HI> to the Fleet, and to &s;eek out the Ships that belonged to the Flag, to give them notice of the Departure of the Fleet. They thought likewi&s;e fit to order a Squadron of 18 Ships, who&s;e Men were as yet all &s;ound, to keep the Sea three Weeks longer; the Command of which was given to <HI>Sweers,</HI> who was made Rear-Admiral of the Admiralty of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> up|on the Death of <HI>de Wilde.</HI> He had Orders to crui&s;e about the <HI>Dogger &s;and</HI> till the begin|ning of <HI>December,</HI> and to do his be&s;t to go to meet the Ships bound homewards from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and that were expected back from <HI>Norway,</HI> in order to convoy them &s;afe home; and at the &s;ame

<P>The &s;ame Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 1&s;t of <HI>November,</HI> after|noon, the Fleet &s;et &s;ail, and tackt about, and &s;tood to the Ea&s;tward. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z</HI> led the Right Wing, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de &V;ries</HI> the left, and the Squadrons of <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and <HI>Tromp</HI> compo&s;ed the Main Battle. The next Day <HI>de Ruiter</HI> put up a White Flag upon his Miz|zen Ma&s;t, and fired 3 Guns for a Signal to the Squa|drons to &s;eparate.

And then Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> replied to all tho&s;e Admirals, again, at once, with 9 Guns; and &s;o the &s;everal Squadrons of the Fleet quitted one another about Mid-way towards home; <HI>Tromp</HI> made towards <HI>Goree,</HI> and the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> the <HI>Zealand</HI> Squadron to|wards <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">elingen,</HI> and <HI>de Ruiter</HI> &s;ailed towards the <HI>Texel</HI> and the <HI>&V;lie,</HI> whither al&s;o went Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Hiddes de &V;ries,</HI> with the <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> Ships.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The States Remon|&s;trance to the King of <HI>England,</HI> concern|ing the rupture of the Peace.</NOTE>THat we might give evident Proofs of our De&s;ire and Inclination for Peace, we were willing after the Rupture, to defer even till this Day, to recal our Amba&s;&s;adour from the Court of <HI>England.</HI> And tho' we had already by ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Of|fers, &s;atisfied all the Complaints put up to us by Sir <HI>George Downing,</HI> in a Time when we could hardly believe, that Matters would ever have come to an Extremity; yet we have done &s;till more, by leaving our Amba&s;&s;adour in <HI>England,</HI> after the tak|ing from us not only &s;everal Places, but &s;ome whole Provinces belonging to the States in both Worlds, and the &s;topping the Ships of their Subjects in the Face of all Chri&s;tendom, and that without any previous Declaration of War. By an effect al&s;o of an over-great Confidence, neither did we recal our Amba&s;&s;a|dour pre&s;ently after your Maje&s;ty had recalled yours, in hopes you would at la&s;t be plea&s;ed to make &s;ome Reflection upon the Mi&s;chiefs a War would bring up|on the two Nations. Your Maje&s;ty alone is Witne&s;s of the advantageous Propo&s;itions that have been made you, in order to attain a Good and Solid Peace. We have offered to conclude it as your Maje&s;ty should de&s;ire, either that each Party should re&s;tore what they had taken from each other, or el&s;e that if <HI>En|gland</HI> should think that be&s;t for its Intere&s;ts, each &s;ide should keep and remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Conque&s;ts, and that with this Advantage for <HI>En|gland,</HI> that tho&s;e Propo&s;itions might have been ac|cepted by your People at a Time when the <HI>United Provinces</HI> as yet were ignorant what had been taken from them in remote Countries. To which may be added, that it cannot be &s;aid, That we flattered
<PB N="327" REF="170"> our &s;elves with the Hopes of receiving any other Fruit from thence, than a bare indemnification for the Lo&s;&s;es the States have &s;uffered, incomparably greater than tho&s;e of <HI>England.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all this, your Maje&s;ty has not only refu&s;ed to accept all the&s;e advantageous Conditions, which may con|vince you of the &s;incere De&s;ire the States have for a Peace. But further, were not plea&s;ed to be &s;ati&s;|fied with tho&s;e other Propo&s;als &s;o di&s;advantageous to the States, offered you by the Mediation of <HI>France,</HI> which they never con&s;ented to. Be&s;ides, your Ma|je&s;ty would never make, or order any one to make, the lea&s;t Overture on your Side, of any Conditions upon which you pretended to enter into Negotiation with the States: And tho' you have been plea&s;ed to te&s;tifie to our Amba&s;&s;adour, That you de&s;ired nothing &s;o heartily as Peace, yet you would never determine to make choice of any means by which it might be attained, or explain your Mind clearly thereupon, either to him or to the other Mediators. We are per|&s;uaded, there is no Chri&s;tian Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> who would not chu&s;e rather at all times to prefer the Sweetne&s;s of a good Peace before the Mi&s;chiefs of a Cruel War, how ju&s;t &s;oever it may be; and we make thereupon the &s;ame Judgment of your Maje&s;ty's Sentiments, &s;ince you exerci&s;e the &s;ame Religion with us. But reflecting upon your Maje&s;ty's manner of dealing with our Amba&s;&s;ador, in contempt even of tho&s;e advantageous Propo&s;itions made you by the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours, tho' they were altogether contrary to the true Intere&s;ts of our State, in that you would never vouch&s;afe to make any advan|ces that might &s;erve for a Ground for us to treat upon together, we thought then that our Amba&s;|&s;adour could no longer &s;tay in the Court of <HI>En|gland,</HI> without Injury to the Reputation of the State; and therefore have thought fit to recal him, and that &s;o much the rather, becau&s;e by recalling yours, has been plea&s;ed to let us know you would not take it ill at our Hands. This shall not hinder, but that
<PB N="328" REF="171"> we &s;hall ever retain a &s;incere de&s;ire to come to a good Accommodation, as &s;oon as we shall have Opportu|nity to do it, in conjunction with our Allies. In the mean while, we shall wait the time till it shall plea&s;e God to in&s;pire your Maje&s;ty with &s;uch Senti|ments as may di&s;po&s;e you to declare what your will is, and what are the Conditions that may reconcile us, that we may &s;top and prevent the Effu&s;ion of &s;o much Chri&s;tian Blood, which is now &s;pilt, and &s;till ready to be &s;pilt in this unhappy Quarrel. We can &s;ay, That we shall not be re&s;pon&s;ible for it, &s;ince both before and &s;ince the Rupture, we have done all we could imagine to be ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and that could be expected from us, and that we are &s;till actually in the &s;ame Mind, and yet without ever having been able hitherto to find out what your Ma|je&s;ty's Intention is upon that Subject. We will there|fore wait till you have more Inclination for Peace; but yet it were to be wi&s;ht, you would be brought to tho&s;e good Thoughts of your own accord, without &s;taying till the Mi&s;chiefs and Di&s;a&s;ters that are now ready to afflict Chri&s;tendom, in&s;pire them into you.

<P>That Treaty was a &s;troke of Thunder to the <HI>English,</HI> who were the more &s;en&s;ibly concerned at it, becau&s;e they had not heard the lea&s;t inkling of it, till they heard of its conclu&s;ion.

It's true the <HI>Danes</HI> proceedings on that occa&s;ion had &s;ome appearance of Ju&s;tice and E|quity, becau&s;e the <HI>English</HI> from the very time they made that Ho&s;tile attempt of which we have &s;poken, upon the Port of <HI>Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> had not only &s;eized on the <HI>Danes</HI> Ships and Mer|chandizes,
<PB N="332" REF="173"> but had likewi&s;e taken their men Pri|&s;oners, &s;o that the Crown of <HI>Denmark</HI> in that Rencounter &s;eemed to do no more than to u&s;e Repri&s;als, had it not afterwards appeared, that they had dealt perfidiou&s;ly in that matter with the King of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;ecretly invited him to that Enterprize for which they afterwards de|clared War again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In the mean time the United Provinces, in order to facilitate the Arming and manning out the Fleet, publi&s;h'd on the 1&s;t. of <HI>February</HI> an Ordinance, forbidding all Merchant Ships, and Fi&s;hing ve&s;&s;els, to &s;tir out of their Harbours, upon pain of Confi&s;cation of their &s;aid Ships and Goods: They likewi&s;e forbad the great and &s;mall Fi&s;hery under the &s;ame penalties and the Ordi|nance for forbidding the <HI>Greenland</HI> Fi&s;hery, was al&s;o renewed. But the States however, declared that their intention in all tho&s;e prohibitions, was to find them &s;ub&s;i&s;tance all the year, without a|ny alteration even after the Fleet &s;hould be gone out, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>About that time, <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;ignified to the States that he &s;hould be glad if they would plea&s;e to change his Quality of Lieutenant Admiral of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>West-Frie&s;land,</HI> or of the College of the Admiralty of the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> into that of Lieu|tenant Admiral of the College of the Admiral|ty of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which reque&s;t the States granted upon Condition he got the con&s;ent of both tho&s;e Admiralties thereunto: &s;o that having ob|tained it, on the 6th. of <HI>February,</HI> he was created Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> and on the 24th. of the &s;ame month, Vice Admiral <HI>Aart Van Nes,</HI> &s;ucceeded him in qua|lity of Lieutenant Admiral of the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> and Cap|tain <HI>John Van Nes</HI> was made Rear Admiral.</P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>English</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of the great Force of &s;o powerfull a League, made very great preparations for War on their
<PB N="333" REF="173"> &s;ide, and exerted as we may &s;ay the utmo&s;t of their efforts to make a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance: But becau&s;e money was wanting they were forced to borrow 1250000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling more at great Intere&s;t, and be&s;ides to help towards the defraying of the extraordinary charges of the War the two Ea&s;t-<HI>India</HI> Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Phoenix,</HI> and the <HI>Fort of Huningen</HI> taken from the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were &s;old, which yielded the &s;um of 1600000<HI>l.</HI> And becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> King had fir&s;t declared War again&s;t <HI>England,</HI> the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI> who was no le&s;s Jealous of his honour than the Mon&s;ieur, publi&s;h|ed likewi&s;e a Declaration again&s;t that Crown, in the following Terms.</P>

<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> both, in &s;o pre&s;|&s;ing an occa&s;ion, had great need of Seamen, to perfect the Compliments of their &s;hips; which obliged the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to con&s;ent to the Exchange of Pri&s;oners, man for man, which they would never be per&s;waded to do before, by all the In|&s;tances and Sollicitations the <HI>Dutch</HI> could make for that effect.

<P>A little time after, <HI>viz.</HI> On the 1&s;t. of May, War was likewi&s;e declared again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by &s;ound of Trumpet, at <HI>Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway,</HI> by or|der of the King of <HI>Denmark.</HI></P>

<P>And on the 11th. of <HI>June</HI> the two Fleets met, and fought that celebrated Battle of 4 days, the memory of which ought to be pre&s;erved to all po&s;terity, as well for the unexampled Bravery of the <HI>English</HI> tho' overpowered by Numbers, be|cau&s;e divided in Force, as for the dear bought advantage of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in it, which yet was far from meriting the name of a Victory, tho' State policy required it &s;hould be bragged of and proclaimed Abroad as one no le&s;s than of the mo&s;t Ab&s;olute &s;ort.

At that time, we were, as I have &s;aid, &s;till at Anchor; and becau&s;e the Wind was high and the Sea was &s;omewhat rough, we thought the <HI>English</HI> had the Weather-gage, and would likewi&s;e come and ca&s;t Anchor, but they in&s;tead of that, af|ter they had faced our Fleet a while, fell to rights upon us; which hapning whil&s;t we were bu&s;y in unmooring, and had our Anchors yet but half up, we were forced to cut our Ca|bles in all ha&s;te, becau&s;e the Enemy was alrea|dy come within Cannon &s;hot of us. without lo&s;ing time then we hoi&s;ted our Main-Sails and &s;aluted the Vice Admiral of the White, who was on our right hand, with &s;ome Guns; and
<PB N="338" REF="176"> then the Enemy begun to fire likewi&s;e, they which were neare&s;t us an&s;wering us each of them with a broad &s;ide. Our Fleet, but e&s;pecially the Squadrons of the Lieutenant Admirals, <HI>E|vert&s;z</HI> and <HI>de &V;ries,</HI> which according to the Order given were to have been to the Wind-ward, were fallen to Leeward, and were the hindermo&s;t of all the Fleet: But a little while after, upon a Signal we made to them to fol|low us in their due rank, they advanced in good Order. The <HI>English</HI> Admiral putting up a Roy|al Flag, attack'd us behind; but he was &s;o vi|gorou&s;ly charged by the Ships that followed us, that he was forced to tack about to the North-ward, which made him with &s;ome of his fol|lowers, fall into our Fleet, which cau&s;ed a great deal of di&s;order in the <HI>English</HI> Fleet. A Fiery Bullet from the Enemies &s;et fire to the Right &s;ide of our Gallery, which we had much ado to quench. The Vice Admiral of the Red, ob|&s;erving that the above&s;aid Admiral that carri|ed the Royal or Union Flag, who&s;e Main ma&s;t was &s;hot down, had tackt about, would fain have followed him; but being already very much &s;hattered, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to do it. The Vice Admiral of the White having followed the motion we made to the South-ward, was about the di&s;tance of a Musket &s;hot from us, who being attackt by <HI>Solomon&s;z</HI> and <HI>de Haan,</HI> was extreamly endamaged: For his main &s;ail was &s;hot to pieces, &s;o that &s;eeing him|&s;elf in &s;uch a pitifull condition he fired &s;ome Guns without Bullet, to advertize his followers to come in to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but they making as if they heard him not, betook them&s;elves to flight, and left him in the danger. And then we thought we might conveniently grapple him in Order to board him; But Captain <HI>Solomon&s;z</HI> Ship falling foul ju&s;t in that nick, upon ours, we were entangled for &s;ome time together, but
<PB N="339" REF="176"> however &s;oon after we got free of one another with|out damage. In the mean time the afore&s;aid <HI>English</HI> Vice-Admiral, making u&s;e of that op|portunity, was fled away, in Company with &s;ome other <HI>English</HI> Ships; which being pur&s;ued by ours, were taken; And the Vice-Admiral of the White was forced to &s;urrender him&s;elf to Cap|tain <HI>Adrian&s;z</HI> who had grappled him. During all the time of the fight, we vigorou&s;ly charged the <HI>English</HI> Navy together with our whole Fleet, till at la&s;t our ma&s;ts were &s;hot clo&s;e by the Board, and our Mizzen and Fore-Ma&s;ts tumbled into the Sea; &s;o that our Ship being quite di&s;abled and out of a condition to make any more Re&s;i|&s;tance, Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> leapt into a Galliot, to go on board &s;ome other Ship, after he had re|commended to his Officers, that they would take care to &s;ave the Hull of his Ship by carrying it into the fir&s;t Harbour they met with, we were brought in hither to day by the <HI>A&s;peren</HI> Frigat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>SInce my la&s;t of the 10th. of this Month, we had a Calm all night, and on the 11th. in the morning, the Wind ri&s;ing higher, turned to the South-We&s;t, which induced us to ha&s;ten to go and Anchor between <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> and the North of the&s;e Provinces. About 9 a Clock our Ad|vanced guards gave us notice by the appointed &s;ignal, that they had di&s;covered the Enemies Fleet. At 10 a Clock the mizzen-ma&s;t and Bolt-&s;prit of Colonel <HI>de Gent</HI>'s Ship being blown into the Sea by the violence of the Wind, we Ordered him to retire into the fir&s;t &s;ecure Harbour. At 11 we di&s;covered the <HI>English</HI> Fleet making to|wards us who&s;e Admiral carried on his Main-ma&s;t top the Union Flag of <HI>England,</HI> and the Red Flag on his Mizzen-ma&s;t top, and upon oc|ca&s;ion for a &s;ignal he &s;ometimes put up a third upon his Poop, without any blew in it. The Lieutenant Admiral carried a White Flag on his Main-ma&s;t, without any blew. There were 3 Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals that carried White and Blew Flags. The whole Number of the Ships that compo&s;ed their Fleet was 70 &s;ail great and &s;mall. We expected their charge at Anchor, becau&s;e the Wind was &s;o high and the Sea &s;o rough that we could not po&s;&s;ibly weigh; &s;o that when the <HI>English</HI> came within Cannon &s;hot of us, we cut our Cables, by which means we lo&s;t each of us an Anchor, and one or two Ca|bles.
<PB N="341" REF="177"> About noon, the fight begun by the Squa|dron of Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> and <HI>Van Meppelen,</HI> who were the foremo&s;t advanced on my left hand. The <HI>English</HI> had the Weather-gage, and we were to Leeward, which gave us the more advantage to fire our lower tires of Guns: After we had fought in that manner about three hours, with almo&s;t equal lo&s;s on both &s;ides, the <HI>English</HI> tackt about to the North-ward; and then the Vice-Admiral of the White, and two or three other <HI>English</HI> Ships were &s;eparated from the body of their Fleet, they being &s;o much &s;hattered, that they were not able to follow them; &s;o that the Captains, <HI>Vander Zaan, Adrian&s;z,</HI> and <HI>Van Am&s;tel</HI> pur&s;uing them clo&s;e, took them. The&s;e are all the particulars I know. About that time Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Ship having lo&s;t her Ma&s;ts, I found by the hoi&s;ting of his Flag on board a|nother Ship, that he had been obliged to change his Ship. I perceived likewi&s;e, that a Ship of my Squadron, Commanded by Captain <HI>Otho Tre&s;|long</HI> in which were the Prince of <HI>Monaco,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> with their retinue as Vo|lunteers, was all on fire cau&s;ed by &s;ome &s;topples; upon which, tho&s;e Lords fearing the fire might get to the powder-room, and blow up the Ship retired on Board my Son-in-Law <HI>John Gelders</HI> Ship, from whence they came on board me on the 12 in the morning.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> having as we have &s;aid, tackt about to the North-ward, Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> and <HI>de &V;ries</HI> went on and charged them again, whil&s;t we were repairing our damages. And the Ene|mies finding them&s;elves to the Wind-ward of &s;ome of our Ships, the <HI>English</HI> Admiral General followed by &s;everal of his Ships, and &s;ome of the General Officers of his Navy, came to an Anchor, thinking to rally his Squadrons, and to &s;top the holes of &s;uch of his Ships as had been pierced with Bullets. But when he &s;aw us make
<PB N="342" REF="178"> a tack towards him, he cut his Cables and ad|vanced towards us with much Re&s;olution. We re|ceived him as we ought, and having intercepted their Rear Admiral of the White, I &s;ent up my Fire Ship to burn him; but they &s;hoved her off with Oars and Iron Leavers as they did like|wi&s;e another Fire-Ship of <HI>Zealand;</HI> however, near 200 of his Men, for fear of the flames, leapt into the Sea, and Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> kept clo&s;e to him till the la&s;t &s;hot he fired. In fine that <HI>Eng|lish</HI> Rear-Admirals &s;hip, called the <HI>Injury</HI> &s;unk, but we know not whether any of the re&s;t of the men that &s;taid on board her, were &s;aved or no. She carried 54 Bra&s;s, and 20 Iron Guns, and 400 Men. The night parted the Fray, and we pa&s;&s;ed it in repairing our Ships, charging our Cartridges, and ca&s;ting out all incumbrances.</P>
<P>On the 12th. at break of day, the <HI>English</HI> having the Weather-gage came powring upon us again. The fight was furious and bloody, and the two Fleets having broken through one another twice, at the third time, Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and Vice Admiral <HI>Vander Hul&s;t,</HI> and &s;ome other &s;hips of their Squadron, fell into the main body of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> where they fought mo&s;t de&s;perately. I &s;eeing the danger they were in, put a Red Flag for a &s;ignal, to the whole <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet to Ad|vance and Fall upon the Enemy; which was put in Execution. Our Ships were extreamly endamaged by the &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance the <HI>English</HI> made. Captain <HI>Solomon&s;z</HI>'s Ship being fa&s;tned upon by an <HI>English</HI> Fire-&s;hip, was blown up, but mo&s;t of his men were &s;aved; and the &s;hips of Vice Admiral <HI>Vander Hul&s;t,</HI> and Captain <HI>de Haan</HI> being both di&s;abled were forced to retire into the next Harbour. In the mean while the two Fleets broke through one another twice more and the la&s;t time my main Top-ma&s;t and Admi|rals Flag were &s;hot down. Afternoon the Ene|mies betook them&s;elves to flight, and their De|feat
<PB N="343" REF="178"> continued all night, they Retreating to|wards the <HI>Thames.</HI> On the 13th. of the &s;ame month, being re-inforced with a Squadron, of 20 light Frigats, among&s;t which were 3 or 4 great &s;hips, they renewed the fight, but the night parted us. The Admiral's Ship of the White, being ready to &s;ink, we burnt her. Ad|miral <HI>Ay&s;chew</HI> and his men were &s;aved by one of our Ships. This morning having called on board the Admirals Ship, all the Captains of the Fleet we have re&s;olved to pur&s;ue the Victory, in hopes that God will ble&s;s our Arms with a Compleat one. I cannot yet be informed of the particulars of our Lo&s;&s;es, any more than of tho&s;e of the Enemies. But I know very well, that whil&s;t we pur&s;ued them, we could &s;carcely count &mdash; or 40 of their Ships together before they receiv|ed a Reinforcement, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble and Potent Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall inform your Noble Mightine&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t Remarkable Circum&s;tances that are come to my knowledge of the Battle, lately fought between the two Fleets. On the 11th. In&s;tant, at noon, we were riding at an Anchor near <HI>Newport,</HI> when the Wind being grown high, and the Sea rough, the <HI>English</HI> Navy con&s;i&s;ting of about 58 &s;ail came from the We&s;t-ward, and fell upon us. It was Commanded in chief by Admiral <HI>Monk.</HI> Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Squadron was po&s;ted to the South-We&s;t-ward, that of Ad|miral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> in the main Battle, and that of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> extended towards
<PB N="344" REF="179"> the North-Ea&s;t. The Enemies begun their at|tack upon Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Squa|dron, who was obliged to cut his Anchor-Ca|bles, and to bear the greate&s;t brunt of their a&s;&s;ailing Arms. His Ma&s;ts being &s;hot down were tumb|led into the Sea by the violence of the Wind. <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Squadron thereupon begun to give way, and to make back towards the main Body of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, and then <HI>de Ruiter</HI> advanced to &s;upport them, accompanied with &s;ome other &s;hips. 'Tis true? The <HI>Engl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h</HI> had the ad|vantage of the Wind, but it being violent, their Ships being by it heav'd all on one &s;ide had much ado to play their Guns with any &s;uc|ce&s;s, whereas we with our lower Tires fired up|on them with no &s;mall effect. At the beginning of the night, we had already di&s;per&s;ed a part of their Fleet. In which their Vice Admiral of the White was taken by a Ship of the Ad|miralty of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and the Rear Admiral of the &s;ame Squadron run in great danger of being burnt to A&s;hes by three Fire-&s;hips, which yet wrought not the effect expected from them: For having carried their Flames no further than his Poop, they were quencht, and the Fire-&s;hips repul&s;ed; &s;o that the &s;hip e&s;caped by favour of the night, tacking away to the Ea&s;tward; how|ever a good part of her Seamen &s;eeing her dan|ger leapt into the Sea, choo&s;ing rather to peri&s;h in the Water than to be burnt. There is rea|&s;on to believe, that &s;hip &s;o &s;hattered as &s;he was &s;unk &s;oon after, becau&s;e &s;he was never heard of &s;ince. During the ob&s;curity of the Night, the di&s;per&s;ed &s;hips of the Enemies got together a|gain and we made a task to the South-Ward. On <HI>Saturday</HI> morning, we perceived the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> behind us, and made up to them, but they without waiting for us, advanced to meet us with|much Re&s;olution and Courage. And then the two Fleets broke through one another tho' a|cro&s;s
<PB N="345" REF="179"> the continual Fire of each others Guns. A Calm came on, and after that, the Wind turn|ed to the South, of which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had the advantage. Our Admiral having broke through the Enemies Fleet, got the Weather-gage of them, &s;o that he prevailed with the greate&s;t part of his Forces over the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, excepting only <HI>Tromp,</HI> who with 7 or 8 Ships of his Squadron was to Leeward. He had changed his Ship, and was then in that called, <HI>the Province of &V;trecht;</HI> he was very ill handled, as was al|&s;o his Vice Admiral, and had like to have been reduced to A&s;hes by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fire-&s;hip. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> con&s;idering the danger in which <HI>Tromp</HI> was, re&s;olved to di&s;-engage him, and for that effect, he ordered the greate&s;t part of his Fleet to make a tack to the South-ward, whil&s;t him|&s;elf with his Rear fell upon the Enemies main body, making directly towards <HI>Tromp,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him: The <HI>English</HI> &s;eeing him come, opened them|&s;elves, and the Admiral of the White advanced at the head of his Squadron, followed by two Fire-&s;hips, to &s;top <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> who ob&s;erving the motion the Enemies had newly made, tackt to the South-ward, to rejoin, if po&s;&s;ible, the re&s;t of his Fleet, which was tackt about to the North-ward, with the &s;ame intention, &s;o that the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> contented them&s;elves with firing upon him at a di&s;tance with their Guns, without offer|ing to follow him. But methinks committed then a &s;trange fault. For it had been ea&s;y for them to have de&s;troyed the few Ships <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had with him, and <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Squadron was able to make no more Re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t them, where|as in &s;pite of their Cannonadings, the intended Junction was effected. The matter pa&s;&s;ed al|mo&s;t in the &s;ame manner, as it did the year be|fore, for by the motion we made, two <HI>English</HI> &s;hips were &s;eparated from the re&s;t, whereof one was &s;unk, to which I my &s;elf, without bragging
<PB N="346" REF="180"> contributed the mo&s;t, and the other was &s;o &s;hat|tered by <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> that the Enemies finding her no longer able to keep the Sea, &s;et fire to her. In the mean while, the two Fleets being got to|gether again, the fight was renewed, and we engaged together three times more, firing per|petually at one another till the dusk of the evening. And then the <HI>English</HI> lo&s;ing Courage, did not think fit to charge us any more, but tackt a|way to the Ea&s;t-ward, in the mean while we chaced them as far as the Calm Weather, and the approach of the night would permit us. On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, the Wind was fair, and the Wind turned to the Ea&s;t, and we pur&s;ued the <HI>English</HI> again till 4 a Clock in the after|noon, the mo&s;t part of which retreated towards the We&s;t-South-We&s;t, in pretty good order; And then they were reinforced, by Prince <HI>Ro|bert</HI> s Squadron con&s;i&s;ting of 20 Men of War, coming from the South-ward. In the mean time whil&s;t we were chacing them Sir <HI>George Ay&s;chew</HI>'s Ship Admiral of the White Squadron, call'd the <HI>Royal Prince,</HI> carrying 92 Guns, was &s;tranded at the mouth of the <HI>Thames</HI> and yielded to Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> without firing &s;o much as a Gun, which after we had taken out of her, the Admi|ral and his men we burnt. On <HI>Monday</HI> the 14th. in the morning, the <HI>English</HI> having receiv|ed a Reinforcement of a fre&s;h Squadron, took new Courage, and came and attackt us again. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> thereupon having &s;ummoned all his Captains on board the Admiral Ship, Recom|mended to them their duty and the honour of their Country, after which we renewed the fight again, and having the Weather-gage we re&s;olved to break through the Enemies Fleet, and by that means, quickly to put them to the Rout. But the <HI>English</HI> Received us with much Re&s;olution and Bravery, and it may be &s;aid, that there and then it was, that the Valour of
<PB N="347" REF="180"> all in General, and of every one in particular was &s;een to appear in its full Lu&s;tre. After the Fight, had been vigorou&s;ly maintained till 4 a Clock, our Fleet was divided into two Parts: For <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> at the Head of one of them, made a Motion above the Enemies Fleet, whil&s;t the other had order to keep below them, with De&s;ign to enclo&s;e them. We had &s;carce pa&s;t by the half of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, but we fell upon them, and broke through them, from the one end to the other, with &s;o much Fury that they were pre&s;ently put to the Rout. And then it was, there was a &s;ad Spectacle to be &s;een of dead and wounded men, and a terrible har|ve&s;t of Ma&s;ts mown down, and of Sails, and all &s;orts of tackle tumbled into the Sea, as well on the one &s;ide as the other. About 6 in the Evening the Enemies betook them&s;elves wholly to flight, and we gave them chace. Being advanced near Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> we boarded one of the Enemies Ships, called the <HI>Havertuin,</HI> carrying 56 Guns, which yielded in &s;ight of Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> he not da|ring to come to her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, but contented him&s;elf with killing me one Seaman, and &s;hoot|ing of the Arm of another. And be&s;ides the &s;hip I took the &s;ame evening there were 4 more ta|ken in my &s;ight. In the mean while the whole <HI>English</HI> Fleet was entirely di&s;per&s;ed, and every one of them &s;ought to &s;ave them&s;elves by a nim|ble retreat! the Sea was covered with wander|ing Ve&s;&s;els, the mo&s;t of them &s;teering We&s;tward. Admiral <HI>Monk,</HI> and an <HI>English</HI> Rear Admiral lo&s;t their main Ma&s;ts, &s;o that I doubt not but they will fall to day into our hands; and &s;o much the rather, that every one of them minding on|ly their own pre&s;ervation before that of any one el&s;e, they were &s;een to &s;camper about with pre|cipitation without taking any care what de&s;tiny befell the re&s;t. In fine, we have all the rea&s;on in the World, to thank God for the &s;ignal Vi|ctory we have newly obtained, and for having
<PB N="348" REF="181"> &s;o powerfully protected our Arms, to the de&s;tru|ction of our Enemies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e Letters, how Authentick &s;oever they were, met with no credit in <HI>England:</HI> And on the con|trary, it was noi&s;ed throughout all the Kingdom that they had defeated the Enemies Fleet, and chaced the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as far as into the very Ha|vens of <HI>Zealand;</HI> Nay, that they had mi&s;t but little of taking Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Ship, (as indeed they had, had they minded their bu&s;ine&s;s, and <HI>Tromp</HI> too;) that the <HI>Dutch</HI> had lo&s;t in that fight, 40 Ships, and at lea&s;t 6000 men; whereas the lo&s;s of the <HI>English</HI> was reduced to but 4 men of War, 3 Captains, &s;ome few Seamen or Sol|diers killed, and about 300 wounded; that their Fleet was but very little endamaged, and would be fit to put to Sea again in 15 days at furthe&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The people of <HI>Brabant, Cologne,</HI> and <HI>Ham|borough</HI> were credulous enough to believe all tho&s;e fal&s;e reports; But in a little time after; they found by experience the vanity of tho&s;e <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Boa&s;ts by the great number of the dead and woun|ded of which all the Harbours of Great <HI>Britain</HI> were full. Their Great Ships were &s;o mi&s;erably &s;hattered, that the people were by publick pro|hibition Re&s;trained from going into the Ports, tho' out of meer curio&s;ity. The <HI>Soveraign,</HI> the <HI>Royal Charles</HI> the <HI>Catharine,</HI> and &s;everal others were mown clo&s;e to their very Hulls; The <HI>Rainbow</HI> who &s;aved her &s;elf by flying towards the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Flanders</HI> after &s;he had put her dead and woun|ded men on &s;hore at <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> retired by &s;tealth tho' with much ado into <HI>Dover.</HI> Admiral <HI>Ay&s;chew</HI> was made Pri&s;oner; <HI>Barklay, Mings,</HI> and <HI>Herman</HI> killed.

On the 11th. in the morning, they with much ado got as far as 7 or 8 miles to the Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t-ward of the North <HI>Foreland,</HI> which is a part of <HI>England</HI> that extends between the Channel and the <HI>Thames</HI> whereby a South We&s;t wind that blew very fiercely they were forced to Anchor. The <HI>English</HI> Fleet being come &s;ome days before to Anchor in the <HI>Downs,</HI> unmoor'd from thence on the 11th. of <HI>June,</HI> probably upon the advice they had heard of the approach of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet. And about noon, the two Fleets met. That of <HI>Holland</HI> was com|po&s;ed of 83 men of War, or Frigats, be&s;ides Advice-Boats, Fire-&s;hips, and other &s;mall Tenders on the Fleet. But it hapned, that about an hour before the Battle, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ships of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, commanded by Colo|nel <HI>de Gent</HI> having unfortunately lo&s;t her Fore-ma&s;t, and afterwards her mizzen ma&s;t by the vio|lence of the Wind, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> Judging her in that condition uncapable to fight, &s;ent her out of the Fleet in &s;ight of the Enemies, to retire into <HI>Hol|land:</HI> The &s;aid <HI>de Gent</HI> removed after that into the Ship of Captain <HI>Henry Gotskens.</HI> As for the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, they were 80 &s;ail &s;trong as they were counted by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at the very time of fight. About 1 a Clock afternoon, they be|gun to play their Guns. Some moments be|fore, the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> had cut their Anchor-Ca|bles to make the more ha&s;te, and to Accommodate them&s;elves to the &s;ea&s;on, and the violence of the Waves which would not permit them to weigh: The two Fleets being then met, they both of them made a tack to the South ward, the Wind
<PB N="351" REF="182"> being then turned We&s;t-South-We&s;t. That mo|tion was the cau&s;e that Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> and <HI>Van Meppelen,</HI> who were before placed in the Rear, found them&s;elves in the Van, and were forced to bear the brunt of the mo&s;t furious and terrible &s;hock that hapned during the whole fight, which they did mo&s;t valiantly. The fight being thus begun, the Squadron of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Nes,</HI> followed by their other Officers, fell thundering upon the Enemies with an undauntedne&s;s, without Example. A lit|tle while after, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigat of the Blue Squa|dron, carrying 50 Guns, &s;unk, after &s;he had receiv|ed a Farewell Broad&s;ide from <HI>de Ruiter.</HI> The Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z</HI> and <HI>Tierk Hiddes de &V;ries</HI> had all the difficulty in the World, to get to engage at fir&s;t, becau&s;e they were to Leeward, and at a pretty di&s;tance from the Enemies. In the mean while, the two Fleets char|ged one another vigorou&s;ly, making always the &s;ame motion, which la&s;ted till 5 a Clock in the after|noon; when the <HI>English</HI> tacked to the North-we&s;tward, as well to keep the Weather-gage, as to avoid the &s;and Banks of <HI>Flanders.</HI> That motion engaged the Squadron of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>E|vert&s;z</HI> and <HI>Tierk Hiddes de &V;ries</HI> in a Bloody Fight, in which the undaunted Valour and Cou|rage of tho&s;e two Generals were &s;een to &s;hine with equal Lu&s;ter.

The Prince of <HI>Monaco,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Guiche</HI> were Volunteers on board the fir&s;t of the&s;e, who hap|pily e&s;caped the danger of the Flames, by Reti|ring nimbly into the Ship, called the <HI>Little Hol|land,</HI> Commanded by <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z Van Gel|der,</HI> Son-in-Law to Admiral <HI>Ruiter,</HI> who receiv'd them afterwards on board his own Ship. In the fir&s;t attack, the Sails, Ma&s;ts, and in General all the Tackle of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Ship, were &s;o endamaged, that another Ship falling foul on him in pa&s;&s;ing by, all his Ma&s;ts were tumbled thereby into the Sea. Rear Admiral <HI>Van Nes</HI>'s Ship came off at a not much better rate, &s;ince almo&s;t at the &s;ame time his Mizzen-Ma&s;t was &s;hot by the board. Upon which tho&s;e two General Offi|cers were forced to remove into other Ships for the &s;ecurity of their Per&s;ons. In which as &s;oon as they had put up their Flags they were &s;een again to renew the Fight, and to Signalize them&s;elves. Their unma&s;ted Ships being carried out of the Fray, were towed away into <HI>Holland.</HI> The <HI>Eng|lish</HI> Fleet having advanced above the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> their Chief Admiral followed by &s;ome Ships of
<PB N="353" REF="183"> his Squadron, ca&s;t Anchor; but a little while af|ter, &s;eeing <HI>de Ruiter</HI> coming towards him, at the head of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, he cut his Cables at his approach, &s;o that they engaged again afre&s;h, and the fight was furious and very bloody on that occa&s;ion, and yet, God be thanked, without the lo&s;s of any of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships; whereas about 7 or 8 a Clock in the evening, a great <HI>English</HI> Ship of the Blew Squadron carrying between 60 and 70 Guns, &s;unk within Musket &s;hot of Admi|ral <HI>de Ruiter.</HI> The two afore&s;aid <HI>English</HI> Ships &s;inking in the view of the Officers and Sea men of the whole <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, I think there is no rea|&s;on to doubt of it. It's true we are not &s;ure whe|ther any other <HI>English</HI> Ship peri&s;hed that day, but at the beginning of the night, the Rear-Ad|miral of the White, who&s;e Ship was a fir&s;t Rate, having been vigorou&s;ly attackt by <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> and &s;ome other Ships of his Squadron, and being al|ready very much &s;hattered, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> &s;ent out a Fire Ship from his Squadron, which fa&s;tned upon her and &s;et her on fire, but the fir&s;t Fire-Ship be|ing put off, &s;unk, and the flames in the &s;aid Rear Admirals were quencht? Then another Fire-Ship of the <HI>Zealand</HI> Squadron was &s;ent to burn her; and &s;et the <HI>English</HI> Ship again in Flames, but that was likewi&s;e Repul&s;ed, and the fire quencht. A third Fire-Ship under the Covert of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI>'s Guns was once more &s;ent to Try to repair the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the others, but was not a whit luckier than they, for fa&s;tning upon the <HI>English</HI> Rear Admiral, he &s;et Fire to him indeed, but a moment after, that was quencht, and the Fire Ship was &s;unk with Cannon &s;hot, &s;o that according to the Te&s;timony of all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers which were pre&s;ent, and were &s;pe|ctatours of that Glorious Action, the undaunted Bravery of that <HI>English</HI> Rear-Admiral cannot but be Admired, which was &s;o much the more Remarka|ble, becau&s;e &s;ome of his men having &s;aved them|&s;elves
<PB N="354" REF="184"> by &s;wiming, and got on board a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship, a&s;&s;ured us, that near 300 of his men leapt into the Sea, at the approach of the two fir&s;t Fire-&s;hips, choo&s;ing rather to peri&s;h by Water than by Fire. The &s;ame Rear-Admiral performed like|wi&s;e at the end of the fight, an Action Glorious to him, but fatal to us, by a Cannon &s;hot, that took away the life of the Illu&s;trious <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z</HI> Lieutenant Admiral, who&s;e good Conduct and great Courage had made him to be Admired not only in that fight, but in many other rencounters be&s;ides. The night then parted the Combatants, it being impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;ee, by rea&s;on of the darkne&s;s, or the thick &s;moak, whether the afore|&s;aid Rear-Admiral, being &s;hrewdly battered &s;cap'd away and &s;aved him&s;elf, or whether he &s;unk to the bottom of the Sea.</P>
<P>When the night was pa&s;t, the <HI>English</HI> Fleet found it &s;elf on the 12th. of <HI>June</HI> at break of day, having the Weather-gage, about half a mile off of that of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Wind at We&s;t-South-We&s;t. The two Fleets made a motion, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> towards the North-We&s;t, and the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> toward the South, with de&s;ign to follow one the other; But the <HI>English</HI> having the Ad|vantage of the Wind, di&s;puted their Enemies pa&s;|&s;age, and without waiting any longer, advanced to them, and fell upon them. The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> without changing their Cour&s;e or their Countenance, &s;tood firm in Luffing, &s;o that the two Ho&s;tile Fleets broke through one another and began a mo&s;t furious fight; yet there was not &s;o much as one <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship that was &s;o unfortunate as to be lo&s;t in it, according to the Te&s;timony of all the Officers, both General and Inferiour of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, given in to the &s;aid Deputies and Ple|nipotentiaries of the States. The Fleets then ha|ving broke in upon one another in that manner, their Guns made &s;trange Havock: For the mo&s;t part of the Ships of the two Fleets had their Ma&s;ts,
<PB N="355" REF="184"> their Sails and Tackling either &s;hot away, or &s;hat|tered to pieces. And as each party was endeavour|ing with all &s;peed to repair their damages, there hapned a Calm, which produced a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, &s;o that the two Fleets floated about in pre&s;ence of one another, till about 11 a Clock before noon, and then the wind ri&s;ing, they charged again, and renewed the Engagement more hotly than ever. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> had then the Weather-gage, <HI>De Ruiter</HI> having penetrated to the very center of the Enemies Fleet, heard a mo&s;t horrid noi&s;e of both great Guns and Muskets which made him believe, that &s;ome of his Ships being &s;urrounded by the Enemies, were making their la&s;t efforts, and were in danger of being lo&s;t without &s;peedy a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, &s;o that without any longer he&s;itation, he advanced with his Squadron, and falling upon that part of them, he forced a pa&s;&s;age through the Storms of the Enemies &s;hot and fire, and found Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> who&s;e Flag was then hoi&s;ted in <HI>de Swart</HI>'s Ship, in the la&s;t ex|tremity, but yet fighting with all imaginable in|trepidity, as likewi&s;e did Vice Admiral <HI>Vander Hul&s;t,</HI> and the Captains, <HI>Solomon&s;z, de Haan,</HI> and <HI>Van Am&s;tel,</HI> their Ships being &s;urrounded and battered on all &s;ides by the <HI>English,</HI> were able to hold out no longer, and were at the point of being burnt or &s;unk, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>de Ruiter.</HI> At his approach, Captain <HI>Solo|mon&s;z</HI>'s Ship was already all on fire, which 'twas impo&s;&s;ible to Quench. That Captain and a good part of his men had very much ado to &s;ave them|&s;elves on board another <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship. <HI>Solomon&s;z</HI> as &s;oon as he was got out of that danger, went on board Captain <HI>Schey</HI>'s Ship, where after he had further Signalized his Bra|very, and given great Proofs of his Courage, during the whole time of the fight, he died at la&s;t in the bed of Honour.

But God be thanked tho&s;e lo&s;&s;es were doubly Recompenced the &s;ame day by the great number of <HI>English</HI> Ships that were burnt or &s;unk according to the following Order, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. A Ship of the Red Squadron carrying near 60 Guns was &s;unk in the Van guard of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, about noon. 2. A Ship of the blew Squadron, carrying between 50 and 60 Guns, &s;unk at three in the afternoon, pre&s;ently after <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had thundred at her in pa&s;&s;ing. 3. A Ship of the White Squadron carrying near 50 Guns, &s;unk a little after, by the &s;ide of Vice Admiral <HI>de Liefde,</HI> who &s;hot her through and through in &s;o many places that &s;he rowled on one &s;ide, and was &s;wallowed up by the Waves. 4. Another Ship of the White Squadron carrying 50 Guns, &s;unk half an hour after, in &s;ight of <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadron, and of Captain <HI>Van Meeuwen</HI> who fol|lowed her clo&s;e, and gave her a Broad&s;ide in pa&s;&s;ing. And ab&s;olutely to convince the World, that the two above&s;aid Ships of the White Squa|dron were two different Ships, it is to be ob&s;erv d that &s;everal Officers and other Sea-faring men &s;aw both of them &s;ink, that is to &s;ay, that the &s;ame per&s;ons that &s;aw one peri&s;h, &s;aw the other under|go the &s;ame fare a little after; for we have &s;o care|fully di&s;tingui&s;ht things in our Examination, that there is no rea&s;on to fear, we have mi&s;taken a

Another <HI>Eng|lish</HI> Ship &s;unk in the mid&s;t of their own Fleet, after &s;he had in vain &s;ignifyed her danger to her Companions, without receiving any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>In the fight of the two fir&s;t days, as like|wi&s;e in that of the fourth, of which we &s;hall &s;peak more largely afterwards, it is certain, that 'tis not to be doubted, that &s;ome <HI>English</HI> Ships were burnt, which yet we could not be ab&s;o|lutely a&s;&s;ured of, becau&s;e fire being &s;et to &s;everal Fire-Ships at divers times, we cannot po&s;itively &s;ay whether the Ships they grapled were de&s;troyed, or whether they e&s;caped, except only two that we are &s;ure were burnt to A&s;hes during the fight, becau&s;e the Officers and Seamen that &s;erved on board the &s;aid Fire-Ships are now actually &s;ol|liciting for the reward allotted by the States for &s;uch Service, by producing good Certificates of their performance of it: Be&s;ides, that the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> pri&s;oners drawn out of the Waves, and &s;ent into the re&s;pective Colleges of the Admiralty, are able to an&s;wer if carefully examined, and to tell out of what Ships they e&s;caped. It is cer|tain that by that means, it will be found, that a greater Number of <HI>English</HI> Ships than we know of, were burnt or &s;unk.</P>
<P>The fight of the 12th. of <HI>June</HI> was terrible and Bloody, e&s;pecially afternoon, &s;o that there were few Ships of either Fleet but &s;ufficiently felt the effects of it by the lo&s;s of their Ma&s;ts, Round-Tops, Top-Ma&s;ts, Sails, and Rigging: A|mong&s;t others, the Top-ma&s;t and Admirals Flag of <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Ship was &s;hot away, about 3 or 4 a Clock, which obliged him to give Order to Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Nes,</HI> till &s;uch time as
<PB N="358" REF="187"> he could repair it, to put the Admirals Flag on board his Ship, and to Command in Chief in his ab&s;ence, according to the Orders before given: Which he did with &s;o much Courage and Con|duct, that after the two Fleets had broke through one another three times, as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were ready to fall on the fourth time, the <HI>English</HI> tackt about and made with all the &s;ail they could for their own Coa&s;ts. Their Fleet was then weak|ned by the lo&s;s of 8 or 9 men of War. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;eeing them flie made all the &s;ail they could, to pur&s;ue them; But their flight was fa|voured by the ob&s;curity of the night, and the Calms that then begun to come on, which obli|ged the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to veer back towards their own Admiral again.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> having Repaired his damages, put up the Admiral's Flag again, and re-a&s;&s;umed the chief Command of the Fleet on the 13th of <HI>June.</HI> But the <HI>English</HI> di&s;covering at break of day, the mi&s;chiefs that the ob&s;curity of the night had hidden from them, and &s;eeing a good Number of their Ships much &s;hattered, thought fit to burn them, to prevent the pur&s;uit of their Enemies and prevent their falling into their hands. After which they did their be&s;t to get into the <HI>Thames.</HI> The Wind was at Ea&s;t, and then turning to the Ea&s;t-South-Ea&s;t, grew &s;o weak that they were forced to crowd all the &s;ail they could. It was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to know ju&s;tly how many Ships the <HI>English</HI> had burnt. But the <HI>English</HI> in their publick News of the 17th of <HI>June,</HI> Printed at <HI>London</HI> by Authority, made loud claim to the Victory, and pretended they burnt but three by order of the Admiral, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>St. Paul,</HI> and two other le&s;&s;er Ships. The <HI>English</HI> continuing thus their retreat all the day came at la&s;t &s;o very near the Sand-banks that are at the mouth of the River, that <HI>Sir George Ay&s;chew,</HI> Admiral of the White Squadron, who
<PB N="359" REF="187"> was in the <HI>Royal Prince</HI> carrying 90 Bra&s;s Guns, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ships of the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> Fleet, run a ground upon the bank called, the <HI>Galloper,</HI> which was a great misfortune for a Ge|neral who had given &s;ignal proofs of his Courage all the whole time of the fight, and who was then retiring only by order of his Admiral: And 'tis a very a&s;toni&s;hing thing that after he had fired &s;everal Guns to give notice to the re&s;t of the Ships of the Fleet to advance to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet no body would offer to come nigh him, but he was thus de&s;erted and left expo&s;ed to danger even by the Ships of his own Squadron. Being in that pitiful condition, he &s;aw him&s;elf ju&s;t go|ing to be burnt by the approach of two <HI>Dutch</HI> Fire-&s;hips, if Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> who was then in the Ship of Rear Admiral <HI>Sweers,</HI> had not given a &s;ignal to Command the Fire-Ships to pro|ceed no further, &s;o much the rather becau&s;e by putting up a Flag on board him, in the manner u|&s;ual on &s;uch occa&s;ions, he &s;hewed marks of Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, and demanded Quarter, upon which the Seamen of Rear-Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> Ship, had Order from Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> to go on board Admiral <HI>Ay&s;chew,</HI> which they did accordingly. And Admiral <HI>Ay&s;chew,</HI> and &s;ome of his Officers were Conducted on board Rear Admiral <HI>Sweers,</HI> and the next day being put into a Galliot, he was conveyed to the <HI>Hague,</HI> by order of Admi|ral <HI>de Ruiter.</HI> As for his Ship, the <HI>Prince Roy|al,</HI> tho' &s;he was afterwards got off of the Bank, yet becau&s;e &s;he was &s;o extreamly &s;hattered that <HI>de Ruiter</HI> thought her not in a condition to be a|ble to follow the main body of the Fleet, he Com|manded her to be burnt; which was immedi|ately put in execution, after they had taken out the men. Near about the &s;ame time towards evening a Squadron of 22 <HI>English</HI> Men of War appeared towards the We&s;t, under the Command of Prince <HI>Robert,</HI> who according to the advices we
<PB N="360" REF="188"> had of him, was detached away the Day before, to &s;ail towards the Harbours of <HI>Plymouth</HI> and <HI>Port&s;|mouth,</HI> in order to joyn &s;ome other Men of War, and to go meet the Duke of <HI>Beauford,</HI> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> and to fight him. Three other great <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Ships that were come out of the <HI>Thames</HI> like|wi&s;e joyned him, which altogether made a Rein|forcement of 25 Men of War. At the Sight and Approach of that Succour, the Squadron of <HI>Zea|land</HI> and <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> advanced to fight them; but Prince <HI>Robert</HI> avoided them, and tackt away to joyn the Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet, &s;o that he joyned them accordingly about the Dusk of Night. And then the Enemies Fleet was compo&s;ed of 60 Men of War, of which the mo&s;t part were fre&s;h and in good Con|dition. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was &s;till 64 Men of War &s;trong, but having maintained already a Fight of 3 Days, both their Ships and Men had &s;uffered very much, and their Forces were in a manner &s;pent. As for the re&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, there were three of them burnt or &s;unk, as has been already &s;aid; the re&s;t were detached away, to conduct into <HI>Holland</HI> the Pri&s;es taken from the Enemies, or tho&s;e of our Ships that were unma&s;ted and di&s;abled by them.</P>
<P>Things being in that State, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> be|ing &s;till at the Eve of another bloody Battle, made a Motion in the Night, in order to avoid the Banks, and get more Sea-room. When it was Day, Admi|ral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> fired &s;everal Guns to &s;ummon the Ge|nerals and Captains of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet on Board him, where he held a Council of War, and ex|horted every one of them in particular, to have in Recommendation his own Honour, and the Glory of his Country. So that after he had given them the nece&s;&s;ary Orders, the Fight begun again on the 14th of <HI>June,</HI> at 8 in the Morning, and was fought between the <HI>Foreland,</HI> and the Banks of <HI>Flanders,</HI> in the open Sea, about 8 miles from the Shore. The Wind was South South Ea&s;t, &s;o that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having the Weather-gage, came powring with the
<PB N="361" REF="188"> Three Squadrons of their Fleet upon the Enemies Navy, in three &s;everal Places, forcing a Pa&s;&s;age through them, by which means &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships were &s;eparated from the re&s;t. After which, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> cau&s;ed a Motion to be made to the South-ward, with de&s;ign to charge the Enemy again, who did the &s;ame on their Side; which was renewed three &s;everal times. Thus the two Fleets fought all the Day with much Ob&s;tinacy, the Victory all the while &s;eeming equally balanced, and not to know for which &s;ide to declare. In the Time of this cruel Fight, a <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship commanded by Captain <HI>&V;itten|hou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> was burnt and &s;unk. And an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fire-&s;hip &s;eeing the Ship of Vice-Admiral <HI>de Liefde</HI> un|ma&s;ted, was going to grapple him, but was repul|&s;ed by the &s;aid Vice-Admiral, and chancing to fall foul upon another <HI>Dutch</HI> Fire&s;hip, they were both reduced to A&s;hes. On the other &s;ide, one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fire&s;hips endeavoured al&s;o to fa&s;ten upon Prince <HI>Robert</HI>'s Ship, to burn her, but was grap|pled her &s;elf by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fire&s;hip that kept by Prince <HI>Robert</HI>'s &s;ide, &s;o that they were both burnt together with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ship that chanced unfor|tunately to fall foul upon them, and all peri&s;h|ed in the Flames. In the mean while, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> with Rear Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> Ship, which he was in, and &s;ome others of his Squadron, after he had maintained a long and furious Fight, found him&s;elf reduced into &s;o pitiful a Condition, that he was forced to retire out of the Fray, to re|fit and repair his Damages, with De&s;ign to return again, as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible to the Charge. <HI>De Ruiter,</HI> tho' weakened by the Retreat of &s;everal of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Ships of his Fleet, which had been already di&s;abled, con&s;idering, that the Sun begun to decline, re&s;olved to make a la&s;t Effort, to force the Victory to declare it &s;elf; and according|ly gave the Signal to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to fail on on all &s;ides upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet. At which Signal the Lieutenant Admirals, <HI>van Meppelen</HI> and <HI>de &V;ries,</HI>
<PB N="362" REF="189"> as al&s;o the Vice-Admirals <HI>Bankert, Schram,</HI> and <HI>Koenders,</HI> and Rear-Admiral <HI>Bruin&s;veld</HI> broke in among the Enemies with all imaginable undaunted|ne&s;s, and it happened, that Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>Van Nes</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>de Liefde,</HI> with the Rear-Admirals <HI>Van Nes,</HI> and <HI>Evert&s;z,</HI> followed by &s;everal other Ships, finding them&s;elves below the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> with the re&s;t of the Fleet, above them, that part of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet that was between them, was &s;o furiou&s;ly attack'd, as was likewi&s;e their whole Navy in general, af|terwards, that in le&s;s than half an Hours Fight, they were put in Confu&s;ion and begun to fly the &s;e|cond Time. On the one &s;ide were to be &s;een the <HI>White Squadron</HI> with 8 or 10 Men of War flying right before the Wind, and on the other, the Admirals of the <HI>Red</HI> and <HI>Blue</HI> making likewi&s;e full Sail, and doing what el&s;e they could, to advance their Re|treat towards the <HI>English</HI> Coa&s;ts. In the mean while, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships at <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Signal, took all the <HI>English</HI> Ships they came near enough to Board. Rear-Admiral <HI>Bruin&s;veld,</HI> having with much Cou|rage and Re&s;olution grappled two of the Enemies Frigats, took them, but afterwards, whether it were for want of Order, or by the Fault of tho&s;e that had the guarding of them, the <HI>English</HI> retook them again. Some time after, Captain <HI>Pauw</HI> hear|ing of that Action, fell vigorou&s;ly upon them again, and wre&s;ted them once more out of the Hands of the <HI>English.</HI> But one of tho&s;e Frigats, called the <HI>Bull,</HI> was &s;o &s;hattered that &s;he, no longer able to keep the Sea, &s;oon after &s;unk. The other, called the <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> carrying 58 Guns, and le&s;s endamaged, was carried into the <HI>Texel.</HI> A like Accident hap|pened to another <HI>English</HI> Frigat, but &s;he was reta|ken by the Enemies. Vice-Admiral <HI>Koenders</HI> took likewi&s;e at the &s;ame time a Ship called the <HI>Nagel|boom,</HI> that was taken from the <HI>Dutch</HI> the Year be|fore, carrying 62 Guns, and &s;ent her into the <HI>Texel</HI> Captain <HI>Ruth Maximilian,</HI> took al&s;o the Ship call'd
<PB N="363" REF="189"> the <HI>Couvertyn</HI> of 54 Guns, and &s;ent her into <HI>Goree.</HI> Be&s;ides them, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers pretend to know of two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships more that were &s;unk the Day before, <HI>viz.</HI> one of the <HI>White Squadron,</HI> &s;wallowed up by the Waves at 6 in the Evening, and a little while after the other met with the &s;ame De&s;tiny; which makes us apt to think that &s;everal other <HI>En|glish</HI> Ships might have the &s;ame Fortune, tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers know nothing of it, the Enemies being in &s;o deplorable a Condition, and pur&s;ued by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> It &s;eems, that God, after he had &s;o gloriou&s;ly favoured the Arms of the Victours, was not plea&s;ed they &s;hould be utterly defeated by the De&s;truction of their whole Navy, which appeared as unavoidable: For the &s;hattered Re|mainder of them miraculou&s;ly e&s;caped by the Fa|vour of a thick Fog, about 7 a Clock at Night. However, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet being victorious and tri|umphant, continued to chace them a long time after their being routed, and would have pur&s;ued them into their very Ports, if they had not been afraid their Ships would have lo&s;t them&s;elves, and have been &s;cattered. And therefore <HI>de Ruiter</HI> having fired &s;ome Guns for a Signal to adverti&s;e all the Ships of his Fleet to veer back towards their Admiral, and the whole <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet thereupon a&s;&s;embling toge|ther, they &s;ailed away all Night lei&s;urely, and with little Sail homewards.</P>
<P>The next Morning, which was the ^2^2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th of <HI>June,</HI> the <HI>English</HI> appearing no more at Sea, the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> gave over chacing them, and <HI>de Ruiter</HI> arrived the &s;ame Day, and anchored at <HI>Wielingen,</HI> which was the Rendezvous appointed them by the States, his Fleet then con&s;i&s;ting of 60 Men of War. Nine <HI>Holland</HI> Men of War, be&s;ides that Commanded by Colonel <HI>de Gent,</HI> which were mo&s;t endamaged, or who had Orders to guard home the Pri&s;es taken from the <HI>English,</HI> were already arrived at <HI>Goree:</HI> Ten more had been &s;ent before at &s;everal Times up|on the &s;ame Errand to the <HI>Texel,</HI> which was the
<PB N="364" REF="190"> Place of their Rendezvous. And the four others, as we have already related, were burnt or &s;unk in the Fight, making in all, with a light Frigat of the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> that had &s;erved the Fleet as an Advice-Yacht, the number of 85 Men of War that com|po&s;ed the Fleet, be&s;ides Fire&s;hips and Tenders, when it came out of the <HI>Texel:</HI> Whereas on the contra|ry we hear, That the Remainder of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet retired in Di&s;order into the neare&s;t Harbours, and the mo&s;t of them into <HI>Harwich.</HI> To this let us add for conclu&s;ion, That the <HI>&V;nited Provinces</HI> have all the rea&s;on in the World to thank God for ble&s;&s;ing their Arms with &s;o &s;ignal a Victory, &s;ince without counting in tho&s;e Ships of the Enemies that were burnt or &s;unk, of which the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers had no Knowledge, the <HI>English</HI> Fleet was weakened with the Lo&s;s of 23 Men of War taken or de&s;troy|ed by the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> among which, were an Ad|miral and a Vice-Admiral: Whereas on the &s;ide of the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> there are counted but 4 lo&s;t, neither did there remain any thing in the Hands of the <HI>English,</HI> after a Battle of 4 Days, that could &s;hew the lea&s;t Advantage they had gotten over the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that could dimini&s;h the Glory of the Vi|ctory, that was &s;o ju&s;tly due to them.</P>
</FLOATEXT>
<P>This was the Relation publi&s;h'd by the States, of the memorable Battle of 4 Days, the Bloodie&s;t and mo&s;t terrible one certainly that ever was fought at Sea. But the unexpected &s;peedy coming out of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet again in little above 6 Weeks after, with much greater Strength than before; and with &s;everal of tho&s;e Ships &s;aid to have been lo&s;t, took off very much from the Credit of the above&s;aid Re|lation, how Authentick &s;oever it had appeared before. However, that dear-bought Advantage which they called a Victory, was &s;o much the greater on the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;ide; becau&s;e their Allies, the <HI>French,</HI> were not there to &s;hare with them in it, but only decoying away a con&s;iderable part of the <HI>English</HI> Forces to hunt after them, where they were re&s;olved
<PB N="365" REF="190"> not to be found, had left the <HI>Dutch</HI> the fair Oppor|tunity, with their whole Force, to fall upon little more than half the <HI>English</HI> Royal Navy. For not|with&s;tanding all the fair Promi&s;es <HI>France</HI> had made, to joyn their Fleet to that of the States, and the mighty Hopes they had given them of their great De&s;igns, they all vani&s;ht into Smoak, the <HI>French</HI> having no other De&s;ign at the Bottom, as has been already hinted, and has &s;ince more vi&s;ibly appeared, but to get their Ships built, to procure Men skilful in Naval Architecture, and to learn the way of Sea-Fight; which they effected fir&s;t by &s;triking in with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and afterwards perfected by wheedling the King of <HI>England,</HI> which has proved &s;ince to the Smart of both Nations. In a Word, as to the Fighting Part, the <HI>French</HI> left the <HI>Dutch</HI> to cope alone with the Maritime Forces of <HI>England,</HI> as they did in a following War, the <HI>English</HI> to deal with tho&s;e of <HI>Holland,</HI> tho' to hinder <HI>England</HI> from putting forth its full Strength, they were plea&s;ed to appear with their Fleet to be Spectators of the Fray in which they were &s;ure to be Winners who&s;oever lo&s;t. But to return again to our direct Subject, it may be &s;aid, That under God the undaunted Cou|rage and wi&s;e Conduct of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had the greate&s;t Share in what Advantage was gotten in that fierce Battle again&s;t the Potent and Warlike, who tho' outnumbred and overpowered, yet fought &s;o ob&s;tinately, that they would in all pro|bability have ravi&s;hed the Victory from a le&s;s expert and valiant Chieftain than he. For he ranged his People in Battle with &s;o much Judgment, and made them fight in &s;uch admirable Order, that in &s;pite of the mo&s;t de&s;perate Efforts the Enemies could make to break his Squadrons, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to effect their Purpo&s;e. For that Great Man was ob&s;erved with an indefatigable Care, to encourage his Captains and Seamen, and influence them to make his Fleet tack and wheel about with &s;uch nim|ble and well-timed Motions, that at the lea&s;t &s;ignal
<PB N="366" REF="191"> he was immediately obeyed, and thereby lo&s;t no opportunity to charge the Enemies where there was any pro&s;pect of advantage. But his Courage appeared in its Chiefe&s;t Lu&s;tre when he had occa|&s;ion to break into the heart of the Enemies Fleet to relieve any of his Ships and Commanders that were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and &s;urrounded by them; &s;o that by his pre&s;ence and the good Order he gave e|very where and in every thing, he from the ve|ry beginning of the fight did all that could be done to trace out him&s;elf a way to Victory.</P>
<P>Neither was the bravery of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> le&s;s Admirable than that of <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> con|&s;idering his undaunted boldne&s;s in breaking in a|mong the Enemies, and in expo&s;ing him&s;elf &s;o much to the mo&s;t imminent dangers, that he was &s;everal times forced to change his Ship. At the &s;ight of his Flag the Enemies &s;eldom failed &s;oon to turn Tail and fly, looking upon him to be the &s;courge of their Arms. And becau&s;e his Flag had been put up in &s;everal other Ships he was forced to remove into during the fight, the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> askt, whether there were five or &s;ix <HI>Tromp</HI>'s in the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet or no? For indeed, it may be &s;aid, he was in a manner every where, never recoiling, but being often enclo&s;ed in the mid&s;t of the Enemies Squadrons, enduring the greate&s;t fire of their Guns by the terrible and frequent broad &s;ides, they let flie at him. The re&s;t of the Officers of the Fleet, both General and Inferiour, &s;trove likewi&s;e with Emulation, which &s;hould give the mo&s;t &s;ignal marks of their Courage in that fierce Engagement. However the gaining of that Bat|tle co&s;t the <HI>Hollanders</HI> the Blood and Lives of a great many brave men who died there in the Bed of Honour, <HI>viz. Cornelius Evert&s;z,</HI> Vice Admiral <HI>Van|der Hul&s;t,</HI> Rear Admiral <HI>Staghouwer,</HI> the Captains <HI>Otho Van Tre&s;long, Solomon&s;z, Jan&s;z, &V;ttenhout, Wouter, Wyngaarden, Adam Hourtuin, Simon Bink,</HI> and about 800 Seamen or Soldiers. The Num|ber
<PB N="367" REF="191"> of the wounded amounted to 11 or 1200, a|mong&s;t whom was Captain <HI>Vikrot</HI> who died a little while after at <HI>Hoorne.</HI> But the lo&s;s of the <HI>English,</HI> was as we have &s;aid, related to be in|comparably greater, there being reckoned to be a|bout 6000 men killed, among&s;t whom were the Vice Admirals, <HI>Sir Wil. Barkley</HI> and Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Mings,</HI> and &s;everal Captains. And about 3000 <HI>English</HI> were made Pri&s;oners, that were either &s;aved out of the &s;hips that were &s;unk, or el&s;e found on board tho&s;e that were taken. Be&s;ides which, the <HI>Holland</HI> Accounts rec|kon them to have lo&s;t 23 men of War, whereof 17 were &s;aid to be burnt, or &s;unk, and the other 6, <HI>viz. the Swift&s;ure, the Loyal George, the Le|venwolden,</HI> and <HI>the Couvertyne</HI> were carried into <HI>Goree,</HI> and <HI>the E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>the Nagelboom</HI> into the <HI>Texel.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t other remarkable pa&s;&s;ages in that fight, the undaunted Re&s;olution of Vice-Admiral <HI>Barkley</HI> was much admired, who having 40 men killed on board him, and being no longer a|ble to make re&s;i&s;tance, yet was &s;o ob&s;tinately bent to fight, that he would take no quarter, and would have killed with his own hand 3 or 4 of his Enemies that had boarded his Ship; but at la&s;t being &s;hot into the throat with a Mus|ket Bullet, he retired into the Captains Cabbin, where laying him&s;elf down at his length on a Table, he was found in that po&s;ture dead by the Victors, all over be&s;mear'd with the blood flowing out of his wounds. Rear Admiral <HI>Sweers,</HI> hav|ing boarded Admiral <HI>Ay&s;chew</HI>'s Ship, this Latter delivered to him the Keys of his and yielded him&s;elf up to the di&s;cretion of the Victour. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> took out of his Ship, 500 men, and a little while after the flames get|ting to the Powder Room, it blew up about 11 a Clock at night. That Ship carried 92 Guns, of which tho&s;e of the lowe&s;t Tire were of thirty &s;ix Pounds Bore, and there were 8 of 48. Her whole Compliment of Men was 620, and
<PB N="368" REF="192"> &s;he was the &s;ame Ship that the King of <HI>Eng|land</HI> embark'd in when he returned to be Re-e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in his Throne, in 1660. Vice Admiral <HI>Mings</HI> having received a Musket &s;hot in his throat &s;tood about half an hour holding his Finger upon the wound, to keep it clo&s;ed, and to &s;top the blood, but a &s;econd Musket &s;hot taking him in the neck he died, after having given mo&s;t &s;ignal proofs of his Courage to the very la&s;t ga&s;p.

<P>WE always thought,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The States Letter to the King of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></NOTE> the honours due to the great men were not incompatible with the duties of War, and that Virtue and Valour ought to

Which induced us to give &s;ome &s;ingular marks of it in relation to the Body of S r <HI>Willaim Barkley</HI> Vice Admiral of the White Squadron in your Ma|jesties Fleet. He gave &s;uch great proofs of his bravery and undaunted Courage in the la&s;t fight, that we were willing to pay tho&s;e be&s;t duties to his Il|lu&s;trious memory.

<PB N="373" REF="194"> his Father, four of his Brothers, and one of his Sons had done before him with &s;o much Glory, who all had the Happine&s;s to die in the Service of the State, with their Arms in their Hands, af|ter they had &s;ignaliz'd them&s;elves in many Battels. The States of <HI>Zealand</HI> making Reflection upon his con&s;ummate Experience in Sea-affairs, and the un|daunted Courage and good Conduct he had &s;hewn in &s;everal Battels, and even in the very la&s;t Years Fight, according to the unanimous Te&s;timony of all the Officers of the Fleet, granted his Demands, as being per&s;waded, that at a time when they had lo&s;t &s;o many great Men, this Gentleman might do good Services to his Country by &s;ucceeding them. And accordingly having propos'd it in the A&s;&s;em|bly of the States-General, they con&s;ented to it.</P>
<P>The States Fleet being got ready to put to Sea again, and being 60 &s;ail &s;trong of Men of War or Frigats, unmoor'd on the 5th of <HI>July</HI> from <HI>Wielin|gen,</HI> under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter;</HI> and &s;ome regular Land-Troops, drawn out of the Garri&s;ons, were privately march'd beforehand, to be embark'd on board &s;ome Tran&s;port-&s;hips, which were de&s;ign'd to make a De&s;cent. And all the whole Fleet being thus advanced over again&s;t <HI>Schoonevelt,</HI> was reinforced with 5 Men of War and 7 Frigats, be&s;ides another Reinforcement they receiv d &s;ome days after, by the arrival of Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and &s;ome other general Officers, out of the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> or the <HI>Texel.</HI> The great diligence and expe|dition that was u&s;ed to get betimes to Sea, and to prevent the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> made them conceive great Hopes of Succe&s;s; for they promi&s;ed them&s;elves to be able to &s;urprize the Enemies, to enter into the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> or <HI>Harwich,</HI> to make &s;ome con&s;i|derable havock there, and de&s;troy the Enemy's Fleet, or at lea&s;t to make &s;ome De&s;cent. But they were mightily &s;urpriz'd when they &s;aw tho&s;e Peo|ple whom they thought they had maul'd and wea|ken'd beyond a recovery for that Year, appear of

<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet was divided into three Squa|drons, the fir&s;t of which was under the immediate Conduct of Lieutenant-Admiral General <HI>de Ruiter;</HI> the &s;econd under the Lieutenant-Admirals <HI>Evert&s;z,</HI> and <HI>Tierke Hiddes de &V;ries;</HI> and the third was commanded by the Lieutenant-Admirals <HI>Tromp</HI> and <HI>Van Meppel;</HI> and in that order they kept the mouth of the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;hut up till the fir&s;t day of <HI>Augu&s;t;</HI> and then the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, being 90 &s;ail &s;trong, taking advantage of the Tide, came out of the River in &s;ight of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, which gave place to them, becau&s;e <HI>de Ruiter</HI> was afraid of run|ning aground upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o had done all he could to make his Fleet &s;heer off to a convenient di&s;tance from it, that he might give no Advantage to the Enemy &s;o near their own Coa&s;ts. And as it hapned, 'twas a great Happine&s;s for the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet they had done &s;o; for the next day, the Wind ri&s;ing high, was follow'd with a fu|rious Tempe&s;t of Thunder, Lightning, and a great Rain; but, which la&s;ted not very long, the next day, <HI>viz.</HI> the 4th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the two ho&s;tile Fleets anchor'd pretty near one-another, and pa&s;&s;ed all the Night in pre&s;ence one of the other.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Navy commanded by General <HI>Monk</HI> was compo&s;ed of 90 &s;ail of Men of War, and 20 Fire&s;hips, and was likewi&s;e divided into three Squadrons, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>White</HI> Squadron, commanded by Sir <HI>Thomas Allen;</HI> the <HI>Red</HI> one, under the Con|duct

Let us &s;ay then rather, that in the heat of the Fight, and being tran&s;ported by his natu|ral Eagerne&s;s and Intrepidity, he would needs give cha&s;e to the <HI>English</HI> Blew Squadron, and that was it that was all his Crime; for if <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and the Lieutenant-Admirals <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> and <HI>de &V;ries</HI> had gained any advantage over the <HI>English,</HI> I am per|&s;waded, they never would have complain'd that <HI>Tromp</HI> had de&s;erted them. In the mean while, by a &s;ad rever&s;e of Jadi&s;h and Uncon&s;tant Fortune, the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who had gathered &s;ome Lawrels in the precedent Expedition, were forced in this la&s;t to yield to the <HI>English</HI> the &s;o much conte&s;ted Em|pire of the Sea.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Letter to the States about the Fight in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1666.</NOTE>SInce my la&s;t, of the 4th of this Month, before Noon, the 2 Fleets engaged in Fight, about ele|ven of the Clock, the Wind at North, our Van|guard, under the Conduct of Lieutenant-Admi|ral <HI>Evert&s;z,</HI> begun the Attack, and engaged with the Enemies <HI>White</HI> Squadron: The main Battel, under my own Command, fought again&s;t the <HI>Red</HI> Squadron; but it was a great &s;urprize to me, when I &s;aw Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> who command|ed the Rear, in&s;tead of advancing with his Squa|dron, to lag behind, which gave opportunity to the <HI>English</HI> to &s;eparate us, and get between him and I. I am al&s;o obliged to tell you, That I did not perceive he was in any Action with them till towards Evening, when he fought a very lit|tle while again&s;t &s;ome Ships of the <HI>Blew</HI> Squa|dron. However it was, my Ship being attackt by the <HI>Soveraign</HI> General, on the one &s;ide, and by the <HI>Na&s;eby</HI> and &s;everal other Ships on the other, with&s;tood the greate&s;t &s;hock of the Enemies, as likewi&s;e did my whole Squadron; but we recei|ved them &s;o vigorou&s;ly that after an ob&s;tinate Fight of three hours, they were forced to quit us for &s;ome time. In that while General <HI>Monk</HI>'s Ship was &s;o &s;hatter'd, that he was forced to change his Ship, as we found by the removal of the Admiral's Flag; as was afterwards more par|ticularly reported to us. We therefore took our advantage of the Re&s;pite and Relea&s;e given us by the <HI>English,</HI> to repair our Lo&s;&s;es and Damages; and having ob&s;erved that our Vanguard went &s;till further and further from my Squadron, following the advantage of the Weathergage which they had gotten, I fired &s;ome Guns, to command them to veer back towards the Admirals Flag, but that was not able to &s;top them. The <HI>English</HI> Admi|ral having remarkt that, came pouring with his Squadron upon me and &s;ome other Ships belong|ing
<PB N="377" REF="196"> to my Flag, which engaged me in a cruel fight, which yet I maintain'd vigorou&s;ly, in hopes that either <HI>Tromp</HI> or <HI>Meppel</HI> would come in to my a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance from behind, or el&s;e Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z,</HI> who had the Vanguard, from before; but I afterwards found that I had but vainly flatter|ed my &s;elf with that Hopes, &s;o that my Ship ha|ving had all her Sails and Rigging &s;hot down by the board, I &s;aw my &s;elf di&s;abled to govern her any longer: and being thus reduced into a con|dition not to be able to make any more re&s;i&s;tance, by rea&s;on of the great number of killed and woun|ded I had on board me, I was con&s;trained with &s;mall &s;ail to follow the body of my Squadron, which began to fly. As for Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> who had the weathergage, it was ea&s;ie for him to have veered back towards us, whereas it was impo&s;&s;ible for us to move towards him; and I know not what obliged him not to do it. Seeing our &s;elves thus de&s;erted, we thought there was no other Remedy left for our pre&s;ervation, but to tack away to the &s;outhward, and to fight retreat|ing: Be&s;ides that, the Calm which began to come on would not &s;uffer us quickly to get out of the Fight; and we being likewi&s;e glad to make but little &s;ail away, as thinking that by favour of the Night the &s;aid Rear might joyn us, and that we might return all together to the Charge, and di&s;pute the Victory with the Enemy. But after all, when the Day was come, we perceived none come near us but the main Body of the <HI>English</HI> Fleet, who began to play their Guns upon us in pur&s;uing us: We an&s;wered them as well as we could, from behind; but the <HI>English</HI> having de|tached out a Fire&s;hip to come and burn me to A&s;hes, I made my Barge advance, which was backt by &s;ome others, into which tho&s;e brave <HI>French</HI> Volunteer Lords, <HI>de Lorrain, de Lavoy,</HI> and <HI>de Coa&s;lin</HI> leapt with their Retinue, who went and forced the Fire&s;hip's Men to jump into the Sea,
<PB N="378" REF="197"> and &s;ave them&s;elves by &s;wimming, after they had &s;et Fire to her, and &s;o by that glorious Action pre|&s;erved the Admiral Ship from Flames. In the mean while having di&s;covered &s;ome of our Ships that were &s;cattered from us in the Darkne&s;s of the Night, the <HI>English</HI> &s;ent a Detachment of &s;ome Ships from their Fleet to give them Chace; which as &s;oon as I perceived I &s;ummoned all the Officers on Board the Admiral Ship, 20 of which were commanded by Order of Vice-Admiral <HI>Bankert,</HI> to oppo&s;e the De&s;ign of the Enemies. As &s;oon as the Account of the Ammunition and Provi&s;ion, which the &s;aid Officers of the Fleet have need of, as al&s;o of the Lo&s;&s;es and Damages they have &s;uf|fered, &s;hall be drawn up, as they have repre&s;ented it to me &s;everal times, I will take Care to &s;end it to the Colleges of the Admiralties. I have al&s;o been informed in general, with much Regret, of the Death of &s;ome of our General Officers and Captains; namely, of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>John Evert&s;z,</HI> who having one of his Legs &s;hot off, died a little after. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tierke Hiddes de &V;ries,</HI> has likewi&s;e a Leg &s;hot off, and is in Danger of Death; his Ship lo&s;t us in the Night, and that of Vice-Admiral <HI>Bankert</HI> is &s;unk: Vice-Admiral <HI>Koenders</HI> is likewi&s;e killed, as al&s;o the Captains <HI>Ruth Maximilian, Jeupian Poel,</HI> and <HI>Henry Vroom.</HI> Captain <HI>Hugh van Nieuhof</HI> hav|ing lo&s;t a Leg, and <HI>Cornelius Hogenhoek</HI> being wounded in the Belly are al&s;o in great Dan|ger of lo&s;ing their Lives. As for the Enemies Lo&s;&s;es, I have yet no Knowledge of them, but by the Report of the above&s;aid Officers, 2 <HI>English</HI> Ships were &s;unk, and 2 burnt. However, it is certain, and we were Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of it, that they were very roughly treated, and that mo&s;t part of their Ships will be forced to retire &s;oundly bat|tered. I am pe&s;waded your High and Mightine&s;&s;es will be informed of it, even before you have re|ceived this pre&s;ent, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>SInce my la&s;t, written on the 5th of this Month, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> has appeared in the Road with the Squadron under his command, and as far as I could ob&s;erve as it was pa&s;&s;ing, it was very lit|tle or nothing at all endamaged.

<P>Tho' the Lo&s;s of this Battle was very &s;en&s;ible to the <HI>&V;nited Provinces,</HI> yet they pretended, the <HI>English</HI> had no rea&s;on to brag of having got any other Advantage over the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet than that of
<PB N="382" REF="199"> having divided their Squadrons; tho' 'tis true, they thought by that means the more ea&s;ily to de|&s;troy them one after another. Here follows an ex|tract of the Letter &s;ent by Prince <HI>Robert</HI> and Ge|neral <HI>Monk,</HI> to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> after the Fight, by which it appears what their De&s;ign was. <HI>We flat|tered our &s;elves very much, that</HI> de Ruiter <HI>would fall into our Hands; but it was calm Weather, and our &s;mall Frigats were not &s;uch nimble Sail|ers as theirs. They were before their own Coa&s;ts, and we were afraid of running upon the Sand Banks. In the mean while as we were holding a Council of War, we heard &s;ome firing of Guns towards the North-we&s;t, which made us pre&s;ume that it was</HI> Tromp, <HI>with</HI> Smith, <HI>and therefore we re&s;olved to make up towards him before he approached any nearer Home. But</HI> Tromp <HI>retired &s;afely, and we follow|ed him in the</HI> Royal Charles, <HI>till we came within</HI> 6 <HI>Fathoms depth of Water,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Smith,</HI> who commanded the <HI>Blue Squadron,</HI> met with but a very ill Reception in <HI>England,</HI> becau&s;e they were the fir&s;t that begun to flie, and the Offi|cers of the other 2 Squadrons made great Complaints again&s;t him.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Deputies of the Ad|miralties and the Plenipotentiaries of the States with the Pen&s;ioner <HI>de Wit,</HI> came on board Admi|ral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> as well to inform them&s;elves of the particulars of the fight, as to give orders for put|ting the Fleet to Sea again with all imaginable di|ligence. In that time the Differences between the two Admirals <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and <HI>Tromp</HI> begun to break out. For <HI>de Ruiter</HI> complained by word of mouth to the Deputies and Plenipotentiaries, as he had done before by Letter, to the States, of the Con|duct ob&s;erved by <HI>Tromp,</HI> and openly charged him with all the di&s;order that had hapned in the Fleet, and with the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the Battle. <HI>Tromp</HI> having under&s;tood all the &s;hrewd pa&s;&s;es <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had made at his Reputation, thought
<PB N="383" REF="199"> of nothing more than of Vindicating him&s;elf from &s;o great and bloody an outrage, by charging <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> in return, with all the blame he imputed to him: And for that effect, he writ the follow|ing Letter to the States General, and to the States of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>

<P>I Find my &s;elf indi&s;pen&s;ably obliged to inform you of all the particulars of the la&s;t fight between your Fleet, and that of his <HI>British</HI> Ma|je&s;ty. On the 4th. of this Month, the <HI>English</HI> Na|vy came up right to us, the wind at North-we&s;t mixt with a Calm. Our Fleet was to Lee-ward, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> having the Van|guard, advanced in good order by favour of the Wind. At that motion, the White Squadron, followed by the main body of the <HI>English</HI> Bat|tle fell upon him, whil&s;t <HI>de Ruiter</HI> who Com|manded the main body of our Fleet, &s;taid about two hours and an half below the Rear of which I had the Conduct, &s;o that Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> was already &s;o far advanced, that his Flag was hardly to be di&s;cerned, and the great di&s;tance there was between the Van and the Main Battle of our Fleet gave the <HI>English</HI> the greate&s;t advantage in the world to &s;eparate one from the other. And Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> who remained immovable in his po&s;t, be|gan then only to advance to follow <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> when the Van-guards of the two Ho&s;tile Fleets begun to Cannonade one another. In the mean while my Squadron that &s;hut up the Rear was forced to remain in its po&s;t till <HI>de Ruiter</HI> was advanced, and then being impatient to engage, we endeavour'd to gain the Weather-gage, to be able to get up to the <HI>English,</HI> whil&s;t a part of the &s;hips of <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadron were &s;till mingled among ours. As our Squadron was thus advancing in good order, the Rear Admiral
<PB N="384" REF="200"> of the Blue Squadron, followed by a Fire-&s;hip came and fell upon one of our foremo&s;t &s;hips, which our Rear-Admiral <HI>Vander Zaan</HI> &s;eeing, he &s;et the Enemies Fire-&s;hip on fire with &s;hot from his great guns. The Admiral of the Blue Squadron followed likewi&s;e by a Fire-&s;hip came up with me and attackt me, Who was backed by the Captains <HI>de Haan</HI> and <HI>Van Am&s;tel.</HI> We plaid our Guns at him and at the other <HI>English</HI> &s;hips, whereof one being very much &s;hattered, and I finding it was practicable to get the wea|ther of her, we boarded her, being backt with a Fire-&s;hip, and after we had battered her a long time with continual Broad &s;ides, we fa&s;t|ned our Fire-&s;hip upon her, to burn her to A&s;hes. That &s;hip was called the <HI>Re&s;olution,</HI> and carried 64 Bra&s;s Guns, and 2 Iron ones, and having 140 men on board her, whereof 45, among whom were a Pilot and a Quarter Ma&s;ter, were &s;aved by our men. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Meppel,</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>Swers</HI> with&s;tood at the &s;ame time a very furious Shock. This latter fought a long time again&s;t the Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Blue Squadron,</HI> who returned often to the Charge upon him with fre&s;h Men; but he was &s;o vigorou&s;ly repul&s;ed by the brave <HI>Van Meppel,</HI> that he was forced to quit him with Lo&s;s; However <HI>Van Meppel</HI>'s Ship was &s;o mi&s;erably &s;hattered, that &s;he had above 5 Foot Water in her Hold. Our Squadron therefore be|ing thus engaged in Fight, &s;eparated the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rear-Guard from their Main Battle, &s;o that we fought with it till about 5 a Clock in the After|noon. And my Ship had then fired away 10300<HI>l</HI> of Powder. The Vice-Admiral of the <HI>Blue</HI> which was behind, within Cannon-&s;hot from us, did all he could to burn Captain <HI>de Haan,</HI> but the Fire-&s;hip's Crew that were detached for that purpo&s;e, &s;eeing our Boats ready to receive them, retired with ha&s;te, after they had received &s;ome Cannon-&s;hot. We u&s;ed our utmo&s;t Endeavour by towing to get
<PB N="385" REF="200"> up to him, but to no purpo&s;e. However, &s;oon after the Wind beginning to fre&s;hen, and being turned to the <HI>South-we&s;t,</HI> we took the Advantage of it to return again to the Charge. And accord|ingly I gave the Signal for our whole Squadron to fall all together at the &s;ame time upon the Enemy; and at the &s;ame time our other Ships, the Wind being changed, were endeavouring what they could, to get the Weather-gage. By the Favour of that fre&s;h Gale, we came up with the Admiral of the <HI>Blue,</HI> whom we treated &s;o roughly with our Guns, that he was at la&s;t di&s;abled; and his Ma&s;ter's Cab|bin being &s;et on Fire, he fired &s;ome Guns to adver|ti&s;e his Vice and Rear-Admirals to veer back to|wards him to come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the Ene|mies fearing the Danger, in&s;tead of veering back towards him, &s;hamefully betook them&s;elves to Flight; And had it not been for the Calm which then came on, in all probability, not only that Ad|miral, but the mo&s;t part of the Ships of his Squa|dron would have fallen into our Hands. Having gotten then &s;uch great Advantages over the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Enemies Squadrons, we were, in the Judgment of all Men experienced in Marine Affairs, engaged to pur&s;ue the Victory, and with|out committing an irreparable Blunder, we could not let them retire without giving them Chace; for &s;uppo&s;ing we had let the Enemies go off, and turned back to go to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> be&s;ides that the Calm would not have permitted us, we &s;hould have been the Cau&s;e of the Routing of the Ships of <HI>de Ruiters,</HI> and <HI>Evert&s;z</HI>'s Squadrons, becau&s;e they would have pre&s;umed we had given way, and had the Enemies at our Backs, &s;o that by that means, we &s;hould not only have di&s;couraged our own Ships, but have rai&s;ed the Courage of our Enemies, who would not have failed in that ca&s;e to pur&s;ue us. I leave it therefore to your High and Mightine&s;&s;es, and to all brave Marine Officers that have long time fre|quented
<PB N="386" REF="201"> the Sea, to judge, Whether if Lieute|nant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had timely cut off the Enemies Vanguard from their main Body, as we did their Rear, we &s;hould not have gained a &s;ignal Victory? I add, That that might have been exe|cuted with &s;o much the more Ea&s;e, becau&s;e our Van-Guard was &s;trong enough &s;ucce&s;sfully to have fought that of the Enemies. I prote&s;t to your High and Mightine&s;&s;es, That Partiality has had no &s;hare in what has been &s;et forth, I being ready to maintain in the Face of the whole World, that 'tis all conformable to the Truth; and I declare be|fore God, That I have done nothing that betrays my Intentions, which were for the Good of the Publick, and the Glory of my Country.</P>
<P>And now, High and Mightine&s;&s;es, I cannot &s;uf|fer without Reparation, that without having any Regard to all the faithful Services I have done, Ad|miral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> out of a Principle of Hatred and Jealou&s;ie, &s;hould offer &s;uch a bloody Outrage to my Honour and Reputation, as to make me pa&s;s for a villainous and ill-intentioned Man, only becau&s;e God did me the Favour to make me triumph over the Enemies with a &s;mall Force, when he with a Strength incomparably greater, met only with Shame and Di&s;advantage on his &s;ide. So then, if I have in this occa&s;ion, acted contrary to my Ho|nour and Duty, I &s;ee my &s;elf uncapable for the future to render my Services to my Country. And be&s;ides, 'tis not now a Time to &s;uffer any cowardly or villainous Per&s;ons in the great Employments at Sea, but it is rather nece&s;&s;ary, to make Choice of Prudent and Valiant Captains that may be ready at all times to &s;acrifice their E&s;tates and Lives for the Good of the State, which Advantages I can with|out vanity &s;ay, I have hitherto po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that I believe neither Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> nor any other Man living upon the Face of the Earth, is able to ravi&s;h them from me. But I apprehend with a &s;en&s;ible Regret, that many Di&s;|orders
<PB N="387" REF="201"> will happen in the Fleet; and that the Officers and Seamen, when they come on Shore, will proceed to pernicious Extremities, which I pray God of his Clemency to avert, putting my g eate&s;t Hopes in him, and in the wi&s;e Conduct of your High and Mightine&s;&s;es, whom I recommend to his Holy Protection, and remain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> fearing that Hatred be|tween the two Admirals might be attended with fatal Con&s;equences, committed that Bu&s;ine&s;s into the Hands of &s;ome Members of their A&s;&s;embly, to be examined; and Pen&s;ionary <HI>de Wit,</HI> who had al|ways entertain'd an irreconcilable Hatred for <HI>Tromp,</HI> for being well affected to the Intere&s;ts of the illu|&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange,</HI> propo&s;ed to the A&s;&s;embly of the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> the Re&s;olution of the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for that purpo&s;e, <HI>viz. That in order to the pre&s;erving of &V;nion and Peace in the Fleet,</HI> Tromp <HI>&s;hould be cited to come and ju|&s;tifie him&s;elf; That he agreed not with Admiral</HI> de Ruiter, <HI>in what he had advanced; That the Service of the State ab&s;olutely required, That one of tho&s;e two Admirals &s;hould be put out of his Place; and that they could better be without</HI> Tromp, <HI>than</HI> de Rui|ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>That Project was approved by the Nobles, and by the Towns of <HI>Dort, Delf, Leyden, Am&s;terdam, Gouda, Rotterdam, Gornichem, Schiedam, Schoon|hoven,</HI> the <HI>Brill, Alkmaer, Hoorn, Edam, Meden|blick</HI> and <HI>Purmerend.</HI> The Town of <HI>Harlem</HI> would have <HI>Tromp</HI> cited to be examined about the Letter he writ to <HI>de Ruiter.</HI> The Town of <HI>Enku<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;en</HI> was of the Opinion, That Endeavours &s;hould be u&s;ed, to reconcile them together again in a friendly man|ner. <HI>Monikendam</HI> would have <HI>Tromp</HI> to pre&s;ent a Petition to beg his Acquittal, but the States at length took the following Re&s;olution.</P>
<PB N="388" REF="202">
<Q><P>THE Pen&s;ionary has made Report to the A&s;&s;embly of the Con&s;iderations the Deputies of their High and Mightine&s;&s;es have made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The States Re&s;olution about de|po&s;ing <HI>Tromp</HI> from his Place of Lieute|nant Ad|miral.</NOTE> in Pur&s;uance of the Commi&s;&s;ion given them on the 18th in&s;tant, concern|ing the Re&s;olutions their &s;aid High and Mightine&s;&s;es are to take, in order to &s;top and prevent the fatal Di&s;orders that might happen in the Fleet, and to pro|vide for the maintenance of that good &V;nder&s;tanding that ought to prevail among the Sea-Officers, and prin|cipally upon the Examination that has been made of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Letter to the States, from the Ship called the <HI>Holland,</HI> in the Road of <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> dated the 13th in&s;tant, in which he gives a particular Relation of what pa&s;&s;ed in the Fight again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and of the Conclu&s;ion he infers thence, as appears by the&s;e following Words:</P>
<P><HI>And now, High and Mightine&s;&s;es, I cannot &s;uffer without Reparation, that in Contempt of all the faithful Services I have rendred Admiral</HI> de Rui|ter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>&V;pon which having deliberated, we have judged, That the &s;aid Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> after &s;uch great Marks of the Hatred and Animo&s;ity he has conceived again&s;t Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> Commander in Chief of the States Fleet, could not be continued in his Employment joyntly with <HI>de Rui|ter,</HI> without expo&s;ing the Fleet to an inevitable Ru|ine, by the Di&s;order and Confu&s;ion that would pre|dominate in the Command of it. Wherefore, for the preventing of &s;uch great Di&s;a&s;ters, it has been re|&s;olved, and we will, That the Commi&s;&s;ion of Lieute|nant Admiral of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Frie&s;land</HI> of the College of the Admiralty of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> provi&s;ion|ally granted to the &s;aid <HI>Tromp,</HI> be Revoked and Re|mitted by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, and that in con&s;equence of the &s;ame, his Employment vacant by his Di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion &s;hall be filled up with another Officer of Merit: And that the whole may be done in good Order, the Matter &s;hall be put in Execution by the Generality, and the &s;aid <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;hall be &s;ummoned without De|lay

<P>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> then coming to the <HI>Hague</HI> on the 23d of the Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI> di&s;|placed by the States of <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> in Obedience to the above&s;aid Re&s;olution, pre&s;ented him&s;elf next Day before the A&s;&s;embly of the States; where Pen&s;ionary <HI>de Wit</HI> told him from their High and Mightine&s;&s;es, That it was their Will and Plea&s;ure to take from him the Commi&s;&s;ion of Lieutenant Ad|miral of the College of the Admiralty of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> that had been granted him. <HI>Tromp</HI> made him an&s;wer, That he was ready to pay a willing Obedi|ence to their High and Mightine&s;&s;es, with many Thanks be&s;ides for the Honours they had done him. But becau&s;e it was feared &s;ome Mutiny might hap|pen in the Fleet by rea&s;on of the great Affection the Seamen bore to <HI>Tromp,</HI> the States forbad him to &s;tir out of the <HI>Hague</HI> till further Order, and to go or write to the Fleet, upon pain of being accounted the Author of all the Mi&s;chiefs that might en&s;ue. And in Truth there was &s;ome Danger of it, but the good Order that was given and the Prudence that was u&s;ed in &s;o Nice a Bu&s;ine&s;s as that, re&s;trained the Malecontents within the Bounds of Obedience. The &s;ame Day the States of <HI>Holland</HI> advanced to the Office of Lieutenant Admiral, vacant by the Di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tromp,</HI> Mr. <HI>de Gent,</HI> Colonel of a Ma|rine Regiment; <HI>Sweers</HI> likewi&s;e, who was Rear-Admiral before, was made Vice-Admiral of the &s;ame College in the Place of <HI>Vander Hul&s;t, Verburg</HI> &s;ucceeded <HI>Sweers</HI> in the Place of Rear-Admiral, and Captain <HI>David &V;lug</HI> was made Rear-Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of the North, in the room of <HI>de Horn,</HI> who was killed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>De Gent</HI> being informed of the Honours the States were doing him, would fain have excu&s;ed ac|cepting them, and among other Rea&s;ons he repre|&s;ented, That having frequented the Sea but a little

Thus <HI>Tromp</HI> after he had given &s;o many &s;ignal proofs of his Courage, was at length con&s;trained to quit the Sea &s;ervice.</P>

<P>In the mean while, they were bu&s;y at work in <HI>Zealand,</HI> in Arming out the Fleet with an indefa|tigable care and diligence, whil&s;t the <HI>English</HI> lu|red on by the hopes of Booty, appeared before the <HI>&V;lie</HI> with a Fleet of 60 &s;ail of men of War.

The <HI>English</HI> Fleet then approaching near the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;t, &s;eemed at fir&s;t to de&s;pair of being able to do all the mi&s;chief there they had before flattered them&s;elves with the conceit of, by rea&s;on of the difficulties that pre&s;ented them&s;elves in their way; But being in&s;tructed con|trary to their expectation, how to &s;urmount them, by one <HI>Heem&s;kerk,</HI> formerly a Captain in the &s;er|vice of the United Provinces, but who was di&s;|carded from it for his Cowardice, they were en|couraged to &s;uch an attempt as might make the <HI>Zealanders</HI> feel the fatal effects of the lo&s;s of the Battle, by a malicious and mi&s;chievous enterprize that Traitour propo&s;ed to them.</P>
<P>The <HI>English</HI> Fleet being arrived on the 17th.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;poils done by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> at the <HI>&V;lie.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> near the <HI>&V;lie,</HI> got advice by a fi&s;her-man that fell into their hands, that the I&s;les of <HI>&V;lie</HI> and <HI>Schelling</HI> were the mo&s;t expo&s;ed of all tho&s;e Maritim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> Countries, that there were &s;ome Maga|zines belonging to the States, or the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Chamber, unprovided of any Garri&s;on to defend them, and that there were in the Port a great Number of Merchant-&s;hips richly laden. 'Tis true, tho&s;e Merchant-&s;hips, as well as tho&s;e in the <HI>Texel</HI> had been advertis'd before hand by the Deputies, to retire in time into Harbours of &s;ecurity, but not being &s;en&s;ible at fir&s;t, of the importance of tho&s;e Advices, they unfortunately had ventured to &s;tay behind. The <HI>English</HI> therefore together with <HI>Heem&s;kerk,</HI> held a Council, and after they had projected their enterprize, re&s;olved to put it in execution the next day at 8 in the morning. By favour of the Tide, and of a North-wind, 10 men of War, 5 fire-&s;hips, and 7 Yachts &s;ail|ed in as far as below the <HI>Brandaris</HI> of the I&s;le of <HI>Schelling,</HI> whil&s;t another Yacht &s;lid into the

<P><HI>Sir Robert Holms,</HI> of whom we have already &s;po|ken &s;everal times, was the Head of that enter|prize. He con&s;idered, that if he attackt the I&s;les fir&s;t, the Merchant &s;hips would thereby gain time to provide for their &s;ecurity, and therefore detacht away 2 Frigats which entred into the <HI>Ton|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n,</HI> and followed them with the re&s;t of his &s;hips, but being &s;topt by a contrary wind, he was for|ced to fall back again towards the <HI>Brandaris.</HI> Then after he had held a Council of War, he ordered the <HI>Pembroke</HI> Frigat followed by 5 fire-&s;hips, to advance to go and attack the Merchant fleet. And accordingly Captain <HI>Brown,</HI> having fa&s;tned upon the &s;hip of Captain <HI>Adelaar,</HI> one of the chief of the Convoys, reduced her to a&s;hes. The Captain after he had made all the re&s;i&s;tance po&s;&s;ible, leaping at la&s;t into a Boat with &s;ixteen 16 of his men, to &s;ave him&s;elf, both he and they were unhappily &s;wallowed up by the Waves. The &s;econd Convoy &s;hip was likewi&s;e burnt, but <HI>Tol,</HI> the Captain of her was more lucky than his Com|panions, for he e&s;caped in his Boat. The Mer|chant &s;hips cut their Anchor Cables at &s;o horri|ble a &s;pectacle to flie as well as they could from the fury of the flames. In the mean while the men in the three <HI>English</HI> Fire-&s;hips that &s;till re|mained advanc'd?

After that, the <HI>English</HI> with 22 Boats went out of the <HI>Brandaris,</HI> and by fa|vour of their Oars and the Tide together gave chace to the Merchant &s;hips, that were flying, and all of them they could reach, they &s;et on fire with flaming tru&s;&s;es of &s;traw which they threw into them. However, becau&s;e the <HI>English</HI> Seamen were
<PB N="393" REF="204"> Commanded under pain of death not to pillage, the Pilots and Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Dutch</HI> &s;hips found opportunity by that means to &s;ave their men and their Money in their Boats.

But the <HI>English</HI> Admiral tacking about to the North ward, &s;heered away with all his Navy from the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet, which cha&s;ed them, and fired at their Rear, in the view of an infi|nite Number of People that were got together on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>France,</HI> and were &s;pectators of the da|ring Courage of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and of the Re|treat

<P>Four Days after, the States had News of the Burning of <HI>London</HI> by the mo&s;t terrible Fire that ever was yet &s;een.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreadful Fire of <HI>London.</HI></NOTE> For beginning on the 12/2 of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> it made &s;uch an Advance by favour of the Wind, that it was not extingui&s;hed till the 16/6th, that is to &s;ay, 5 Days after, when at la&s;t they were fain to &s;mother it by blowing up &s;ome Hou&s;es, as the la&s;t Remedy that could be thought of. It &s;eemed as if Fire had been fallen from Heaven to puni&s;h that proud City, and that God, the ju&s;t Revenger of Crimes had determined to reduce it into A&s;hes, or at lea&s;t to cha&s;ti&s;e it in &s;uch a manner, that it &s;hould for ever wear la&s;ting Marks of his Puni&s;hment. For that dreadful Conflagration extended from the <HI>Tower</HI> to <HI>Temple-bar,</HI> and in all that &s;pace, there remained not a Hou&s;e &s;tanding all-a-long by the <HI>Thames,</HI> &s;o that it may well be &s;aid, That by that Judgment the Inhabitants of that great City, and even of all <HI>England</HI> &s;uffered Lo&s;&s;es incomparably greater and more &s;en&s;ible than the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had lately cau&s;ed to the Inhabitants of the I&s;les of <HI>&V;lie</HI> and <HI>Schelling,</HI> which were e&s;teemed at Twelve Millions of <HI>Livers,</HI> whereas tho&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> amounted to One hundred Millions. And the De&s;olation was &s;o great that Multitudes of People were &s;een to wan|der about almo&s;t in deep De&s;pair without any Home or other Place of Shelter to go to, and were reduced

<P>In fine, we pray your Maje&s;ty to confirm the general Profe&s;&s;ion and Prote&s;tation you have made, That you de&s;ire nothing more than Peace, and to be plea&s;ed to joyn to it a particular Declaration, that may &s;hew that you determine upon the Choice of one of the Conditions, which you may think convenient for that purpo&s;e; and in con&s;equence of it, your Maje&s;ty is al&s;o prayed to be plea&s;ed to let the &s;aid Conference already begun to be conti|nued, as well in re&s;pect of the Place, as to the Per|&s;ons. But if your Maje&s;ty &s;hould make any Scru|ple to do it, and &s;hould have any Rea&s;ons not to con&s;ent to it, that then your Maje&s;ty would con|&s;ent that the Mediating Mini&s;ters of the Crown of <HI>Swedeland</HI> may make Choice of another Place, where not only our Plenipotentiaries, but likewi&s;e tho&s;e of our Allies as well as tho&s;e of your Ma|je&s;ty may be obliged to meet with all Diligence. And we &s;hall take it for one of the greate&s;t Te&s;ti|monies of the &s;incerity of the Prote&s;tation your Maje&s;ty has &s;o often repeated concerning Peace, if it &s;tir up no Jealou&s;ie nor Di&s;union between us and our Allies, to ob&s;truct it.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The King of <HI>England</HI> made the following Reply to the States.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>High and Mighty Lords,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE received Yours of the 16th of the la&s;t Month,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Eng|land</HI>'s an|&s;wer to the States Letter.</NOTE> which was delivered us by one of your Trumpeters that accompanied the Body of the Decea&s;ed Sir <HI>William Barklay,</HI> in order to be committed into the Hands of his near Relations. We con&s;ider that Mark of your Civility with all po&s;&s;ible Re&s;entment, and we pray you to be per|&s;uaded, that we will do the &s;ame by you, as often as occa&s;ion &s;hall &s;erve.</P>
<P>As to the other Part of your Letter, concerning Peace, and the frank and free An&s;wer we made you on the 14th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> by inviting you to &s;eek it, we cannot enough complain, That all the Ad|vances we have made for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould end in no other effect, but to make us be charged with ill-grounded Reproaches that openly condemn the manner of Acting we have ob&s;erved, tho all the World be informed to the contrary. Tho&s;e are without doubt &s;uch Preliminaries, as are not very capable to facilitate it, and tis a thing altogether &s;urprizing, that you &s;hould endeavour to per&s;uade your own People, and all <HI>Europe</HI> at the &s;ame time, That we are the Aggre&s;&s;ors and Authors of the fatal Con&s;equences which have been enkindled between us: You unju&s;tly accu&s;e us of &s;hutting our Ears to all the Propo&s;als you make for an Accommoda|tion, by refu&s;ing to inform you of our lawful Pre|ten&s;ions: In fine, you pretend that we alone re|ject
<PB N="406" REF="211"> it, whil&s;t you and your Allies de&s;ire it, and pa&s;&s;ionately &s;eek for it, whereas the Truth is, you your &s;elves have to this very pre&s;ent Day refu&s;ed to make the lea&s;t &s;tep that was capable to advance it, and to extingui&s;h the fatal Torch of War. This conduct &s;o contrary to your pretended Intentions, obliges us for the Defending of our Honour, and the Ju&s;tice of our Cau&s;e from &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Out|rages, to declare before the Face of the whole World, how ill-grounded your Reproaches are: It forces us, I &s;ay, to renew once more the Advan|ces we have made for the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Peace, ever &s;ince the very beginning of the War, and which yet you have always rejected. We prote&s;t to you then, that, if you think fit, for the Time to come, to charge your &s;elves with all the Blame, which engages our Honour to provide for its Secu|rity, then we may by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, deliberate with Succe&s;s about the means that &s;hall be judged proper to pacifie our Troubles, and put a &s;top to the cruel Effu&s;ion of &s;o much Prote&s;tant Blood. In the mean while we cannot forbear re|lating the following Particulars, to undeceive the Publick.</P>
<P N="1">1. That we have made &s;everal pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances, but all to no purpo&s;e, to move you to make Repa|ration for the Damages &s;uffered by us and our Subjects, which you were engaged to do by the la&s;t Treaty, which was not violated on our part.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Commanders of your Fleet in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> prohibited our Ships under the Com|mand of the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> the Entrance, of a Harbour, where there had been a long Time an <HI>English</HI> Manufactory &s;ettled, provided with a great Quantity of Merchandi&s;es de&s;igned for the lading back of the &s;aid Ships at their Return; all which Merchandi&s;es were &s;oon after &s;topt by your Officers, under pretence, That you having declar|ed War again&s;t the Princes with whom we pre|tended
<PB N="407" REF="211"> to trade, it was no longer lawful for us to have any more Commerce with them. And about the &s;ame Time, that Imperious and Extravagant Declaration was publi&s;hed likewi&s;e in your Name, in <HI>Africa,</HI> by the Officer that commands there for you, with a Prohibition to all our Subjects to traffick with the Inhabitants of that Country; &s;o that when we demanded Reparation for the Da|mages &s;uffered, &s;hewing you an Authentick Copy of the Declaration lately publi&s;hed there in your Name, again&s;t the Glory and Intere&s;t of the Kings and Princes that have Commerce there, and that are not able without Re&s;entment to endure &s;o cruel an Outrage, you were plea&s;ed to di&s;own that At|tempt, and ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give us any Sati&s;|faction.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;ay, That as &s;oon as ever your Amba&s;&s;a|dour complained of the Ho&s;tility lately committed by Captain <HI>Holms</HI> in taking of your Fort near <HI>Cape Verd,</HI> we a&s;&s;ured him upon our Royal Word, That that Attempt was committed without our Knowledg and Participation; &s;o that after having di&s;avowed it, we &s;ummoned him up to appear here, and after having &s;eriou&s;ly examined the Affair, we declared, that the &s;aid <HI>Holms</HI> &s;hould be puni&s;hed according to the Rigor of the Laws, if he were found guilty, with Intention to make Reparation for the Dama|ges you had &s;uffered. But that Prote&s;tation, how &s;incere &s;oever it were, was not capable to &s;atisfie you, tho' it ought to have done &s;o however, ac|cording to the Tenour of the Treaty: On the contrary, you per&s;i&s;ted to reproach us with having authorized the In&s;ult made by the &s;aid Captain; who being at length come back into <HI>England,</HI> we forbad him to pre&s;ent him&s;elf at Court, and what is more, we committed him pre&s;ently to the <HI>Tow|er</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> where he continued Pri&s;oner till after the Rupture. And yet your Amba&s;&s;adour never in all that Time advanced any thing again&s;t him, that was a &s;ufficient Ground to bring him to
<PB N="408" REF="212"> his Trial; And what is more, <HI>Holms</HI> alledged, That before he attacked your Fort, he intercepted in his Way to <HI>Guiney,</HI> Orders by which your Officers were enjoyned to &s;eize upon the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Cor|mantine,</HI> which they afterwards actually at|tacked.</P>
<P N="4">4. The I&s;le of <HI>Poleroon</HI> was not delivered into our Hands, according to the Conditions of the Trea|ty, tho' we were engaged to great Expences, in Arming out two Fleets at two different Times, which we &s;ent thither to go and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it; the Governours excu&s;ing them&s;elves, by the Orders that had been &s;ignified to them, alledging they were not &s;ufficient for their di&s;charge.</P>
<P N="5">5. We &s;ay, That <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had order to attack our Subjects, at the &s;ame Time when you cau&s;ed In&s;tances to be made to us, to &s;top the Departure of our Fleet de&s;igned for <HI>Guiney,</HI> under fair Ap|pearances, That your Fleet &s;hould &s;tay in their Ports in Expectation of coming to an Accommoda|tion; at a Time, I &s;ay, when you were &s;olliciting us to joyn our two Fleets together, to go and re|duce the <HI>Cor&s;airs</HI> of <HI>Algiers</HI> to their Duty, which we con&s;ented to with Plea&s;ure. And yet <HI>de Ruiter</HI> &s;eparating him&s;elf from our Forces in the <HI>Medi|terranean,</HI> without giving the lea&s;t Notice of his De&s;ign, went to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Guiney</HI> to commit all &s;orts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t our Subjects, and to &s;eize upon the Country under our Obedience. All that pa&s;&s;ed before we had cau&s;ed any of your Ships that were &s;toped, to be &s;old, or that we had attempted the lea&s;t thing again&s;t your Subjects. The&s;e Five Points being proved, and being entirely conformable to the Truth, as we have &s;hewn, and all the&s;e things having pa&s;t before we thought of providing for our Security, by u&s;ing the means an Offen&s;ive War engaged us to, we doubt not but you will pa&s;s in the World for the Aggre&s;&s;ors, and that our Honour will for the future be &s;afe from being a&s;per&s;ed with the Blame which ought wholly
<PB N="409" REF="212"> to be charged upon you. A War being thus kindled then, and God having ble&s;t our Arms with happy &s;ucce&s;s, we find our &s;elves &s;o much the more inclined to Peace, and evidently to &s;et forth the &s;en&s;ible outrages that are done us, by repre&s;enting as if we were ob&s;tinately bent to continue the War by refu&s;ing to propo&s;e pro|per means to procure a Peace.</P>
<P>As for the overture made to us by your Am|ba&s;&s;ador during the time he remained in this Court, we refer our &s;elves to the an&s;wers we made to all the memorials he pre&s;ented us, which give &s;ufficient Te&s;timony of the inclinations we have for Peace.</P>
<P>As to what pa&s;&s;ed in the particular Conferen|ces we had together, it is ea&s;y for you to &s;atis|fy your &s;elves about it by the faithful Report of a man of Honour in whom we have had an extream confidence, and we wi&s;h he would de|clare him&s;elf, whether we have not always Te|&s;tified a great Aver&s;ion to War, and as much inclination for Peace as a Chri&s;tian is obliged to have, not thinking it fit to commit particulars to writing, that we might not expo&s;e our &s;elves to tho&s;e Inconveniences which your manner of pro|ceeding would have excited at that time.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the recalling of our En|voy from the <HI>Hague,</HI> before your Amba&s;&s;ador was called from <HI>London,</HI> it is notorious, he was dri|ven thence by the cruel Treatments u&s;ed to him, for being di&s;poiled of all the privileges annext to his Character, his Dome&s;ticks being impri&s;on|ed, and notwith&s;tanding all the Complaints made of it from us, and the promi&s;es made us, that the like &s;hould not happen any more, his &s;ecre|tary being put al&s;o under an arre&s;t, without a|ny rea&s;onable pretence, and guards being placed before his hou&s;e, and nothing having been neg|lected that was capable of &s;tirring up the <HI>Rab|ble</HI> to ri&s;e upon him, all tho&s;e violences, I &s;ay,
<PB N="410" REF="213"> obliged him to provide for the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on by a hand&s;om retreat.</P>
<P>'Tis true, the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Kings Amba&s;&s;a|dors, after a &s;tay of &s;ome months, and after we had accepted their Mediation, made us &s;ome par|ticular propo&s;itions, but it is true likewi&s;e, that they afterwards di&s;avow'd them, as they were ordered by you to do, and gave us to under|&s;tand, that you had ab&s;olutely di&s;approved them, in confidence that the &s;ickne&s;s that reigned then in our Kingdom had &s;o much weakned it, and reduced our people into &s;o pitious a Condition, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for us to put out our Fleet to Sea again. The Amba&s;&s;adors of the Court of <HI>France</HI> pre&s;ented afterwards &s;ome other Memorials, a&s;&s;uring us from the King their Ma&s;ter, that he would engage to make you con|&s;ent to the project that had been propo&s;ed; and that as to what concerned the exorbitant and unrea&s;onable demand we had made, it &s;eemed improper to &s;erve for the ground of a Treaty; adding, that your Amba&s;&s;ador might receive full power to treat of tho&s;e propo&s;itions, or el&s;e of &s;ome others equally profitable to both Parties. And there their Mediation ended, &s;o that they de|parted, after having declared, that upon the re|fu&s;al of the above&s;aid propo&s;itions, their Ma&s;ter would be obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t you during the re&s;t of the War. Things then having pa&s;t in that manner, 'tis ea&s;y to Judge whether we are at pre|&s;ent in a State to make you any other propo&s;als on our part.</P>
<P>As to what pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Paris</HI> between our Am|ba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary, and Mr. <HI>Van Beu|ningen,</HI> we think our &s;elves obliged to relate it a little at length, to undeceive the pub|lick, by informing them what pains was taken, to per&s;wade them, that we were formally en|tred into a Negotiation, that rea&s;onable and advantageous propo&s;als had been therein made us,
<PB N="411" REF="213"> but that we had rejected them, and that in fine by a Criminal ob&s;tinacy we had broken off the Negotiation. A &s;ound Judgment may be made how things pa&s;&s;ed by what we are going to re|late, that you may be di&s;abu&s;ed of the unfaith|full Account that has been given of them, and of the fal&s;e prejudices pretended to be drawn from thence.</P>
<P>We could do no le&s;s than to recall our Am|ba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary from the Court of <HI>France</HI> after the recalling of the Amba&s;&s;adors of the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, and the Declaration of War that follow'd clo&s;e after it. Our Amba&s;&s;adour then having &s;ignified his Letters of Revocation, being very much indi&s;po&s;ed, a great Lord of the Court that was much con&s;idered, came to vi&s;it him, and told him as a &s;ecret he intru&s;ted to him, that the King his Ma&s;ter took all imagi|nable pains to induce you to a Peace, that Mr. <HI>Van Beuningen</HI> your Envoy would be ready to make an overture of &s;ome propo&s;itions, that might be made for a ground for it. And therefore for that effect he prayed him to defer his Voyage, and to order it &s;o as to meet the &s;aid Envoy at the Queen our Mothers Palace to treat there in her pre&s;ence about the means of attaining to a Peace. Our Amba&s;&s;ador an&s;wered him? that having received his Audience of leave, he was deve&s;ted of his Character, that he had no power to enter into a Negotiation, and that according to his orders he was obliged to depart as &s;oon as ever his health would permit him. A few days after, the &s;ame Lord made him a &s;econd vi&s;it, in which he renewed his in&s;tances, and declared to him in his Ma&s;ters Name, that if he per&s;i&s;ted in his Re&s;olution to depart, without hearing what they had to propo&s;e to him for promoting of a Peace, he would undoubtedly be charged with all the blood that was going to be &s;pilt, for ha|ving refu&s;ed to lend an Ear to tho&s;e expedients
<PB N="412" REF="214"> that might be capable to prevent &s;o great mi&s;|chiefs. Upon &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing Sollicitations, our Amba&s;&s;ador promi&s;ed to meet them at the Queen our Mothers Palace, declaring however, that he had no power, but that if he did it, it would be out of Complai&s;ance and Curio&s;ity to hear what propo&s;als they had to make. And accordingly he went thither at the appointed hour, as like|wi&s;e did one of the Mini&s;ters of the mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian King. Their Conver&s;ation having been em|ployed &s;ome time in di&s;cour&s;ing about the War, and your Envoy ob&s;tinately maintaining that we were the Aggre&s;&s;ors, he propo&s;ed again the &s;ame Alternative that you now have newly propo&s;ed to us, to which he demanded a po&s;itive an&s;wer, namely, <HI>That reparation &s;hould be made on both &s;ides for all the damages &s;uffered &s;ince the be|ginning of the War; or el&s;e, that each party should remain in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what they actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</HI> Our Amba&s;&s;ador &s;hewed him the mi&s;take in rea|&s;oning after &s;uch a manner, and how far we were from being the Aggre&s;&s;ors; he al&s;o Repre&s;ented to him the impo&s;&s;ibility of determining upon the choice of either of tho&s;e propo&s;als, till it had been fir&s;t examined, when the War begun! how? and by whom; without which it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to under&s;tand the true Sen&s;e of that propo&s;ition. After that di&s;cour&s;e, our Am|ba&s;&s;ador concluded that he had not power to treat, but an expre&s;s order to be gone immediate|ly. But that however they might di&s;patch a|way an expre&s;s to inform Us of tho&s;e propo&s;als, which was in his opinion, the only way to come to a Peace, to which he knew of his own cer|tain knowledge, I was altogether inclined. That was the end of an enterview, which they would needs have to pa&s;s in the world for a Negotiati|on, and of which all the blame, and ill &s;ucce&s;s has been imputed to Us. And &s;ince you repeat the &s;ame thing in your Letter, as a con&s;iderable
<PB N="413" REF="214"> advance for Peace, we have likewi&s;e right to make you the &s;ame an&s;wer now which our Amba&s;&s;a|dor made them at that time, namely, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to explain our &s;elves clearly concerning tho&s;e two propo&s;itions, till you have fir&s;t explained the terms of them. In that view, we have accepted the Mediation of our dear Bro|ther, the King of <HI>Swedeland,</HI> as we are ready to refer it to any other Prince, who &s;hall not have declared him&s;elf a party again&s;t us, in hopes that by that means it may clearly appear, what conditions you de&s;ire a Peace &s;hould be conclu|ded upon; tho' you are not ignorant we have particularized &s;everal things about that Subject, as al&s;o &s;everal of your own people have done that are well affected to Peace, and to the good of their Country, that are at pre&s;ent pro&s;ecu|ted, becau&s;e they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be too ea&s;ily per&s;waded into a belief, that as to what concerns the above&s;aid propo&s;itions, you would take a re&s;olution to di&s;patch &s;ome body to Us, to treat about proper means to procure a Peace, and to prevent the inconveniences that have follow|ed &s;ince.</P>
<P>As to the nomination of a Neuter place to treat of Peace with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> which are engaged in the pre&s;ent War, we &s;ay, that as we have no differences with the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, but only &s;o far as he has concerned him&s;elf in your quarrel, we doubt not but we may Ac|commodate our &s;elves together by acknowledg|ing our true intere&s;ts, which permits us not to &s;uffer a good Corre&s;pondence that has prevailed &s;o long time together between us, and that Crown, &s;hould be de&s;troyed by the ob&s;tinate refu&s;al to agree to ju&s;t and rea&s;onable means to come to a Peace. As for the King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> who could not meddle in the&s;e di&s;putes without vio|lating the engagements he had equally both with you and Us, we cannot con&s;ent with re|&s;pect
<PB N="414" REF="215"> to that Crown, to the Nominati|on of a Neuter place. Nay we are con|&s;trained to declare here that the enterprize made in the Haven of <HI>Bergen,</HI> would never have come into our thoughts, if that Prince had not in|duced Us by his &s;ollicitation to &s;end our Fleet thither by the hopes he made us conceive of &s;ha|ring together in the &s;poil of your &s;hips. How|ever notwith&s;tanding the &s;en&s;ible outrages we have received from him on all occa&s;ions that have pre|&s;ented them&s;elves, we make no &s;cruple to tell you, that as we accept the Mediation of our dear Brother, the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as well in regard to <HI>France,</HI> as to your &s;elves, &s;o when our particular differences &s;hall be compo&s;ed, we will accept your Mediation to procure a Peace with <HI>Denmark</HI> upon rea&s;onable Conditions, and that with de&s;ign to &s;trengthen the Union that ought to Reign between the Prote&s;tant Princes.</P>
<P>That therefore you may have no more mat|ter to entertain your people withal in the de|ceitfull opinion, that we refu&s;e to explain to you the conditions upon which we de&s;ire a Peace, and tho' that manner of proceeding be quite out of Common u&s;e; namely, to outrage and at|tack in an open War your Allies and Neighbours, and then to demand of them afterwards what are their preten&s;ions, in&s;tead of offering them a ju&s;t Reparation for the damages they have &s;uffered, notwith&s;tanding the inconveniences that may fol|low therefrom we will not omit to let you know at the &s;ame time, what we would not have and what we pretend. We de&s;ire not your State &s;hould &s;uffer the lea&s;t change, that the Soveraign|ty by which you Reign over your people &s;hould be in any manner weakened or altered, and much le&s;s yet, that you &s;hould depend on any Prince neither do we pretend any other Empire over the Sea, but &s;uch as our predece&s;&s;ors have at all times inconte&s;tably po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<PB N="415" REF="215">
<P>We demand only, that you &s;hould inviola|bly, and in every point ob&s;erve the la&s;t Treaty that was concluded between us, and that the in|jurious Declaration publi&s;ht by your Governours in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>Africk,</HI> be &s;uppre&s;s'd and di&s;avow'd, as contrary to the honour of all So|veraigns and the common right of Nations; and that be&s;ides &s;uch a Regulation of Commerce may be e&s;tabli&s;ht in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> that our Subjects may be &s;ecured from the in&s;ults and oppre&s;&s;ions to which they have at other times &s;een them&s;elves expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>And tho' we propo&s;e not a Reimbur&s;ment in money to &s;atisfie the immen&s;e charges of the War, yet we demand a moderate Sum in con&s;ideration of the damages, and to indemnify us for the lo&s;|&s;es we and our Subjects have &s;uffered, &s;uch a one as &s;hall be judged rea&s;onable; and moreover that &s;ecurity be given, that the &s;aid Treaty &s;hall be inviolably ob&s;erved in all things as the Me|diators &s;hall find agreeable to Rea&s;on and Ju|&s;tice.</P>
<P>In fine, we expect that in order to the pro|moting &s;o pious and important a work as is that of the Peace to be made between us, and which is to confirm and pre&s;erve that of all Chri&s;ten|dom, you &s;hall depute &s;ome per&s;on to come to us to Regulate the Preliminaries that may con|tribute to bring the Treaty to perfection. This being done we doubt not but God will protect us, and that he will turn all things to good, which will appear principally by reciprocal Te&s;timonies of tenderne&s;s, and on our part by the continuation of the good will we always have had for your State; but if for particular rea&s;ons, you reject this expedi|ent, and that you ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;t again&s;t your true intere&s;ts to refu&s;e to accept the Peace that is put into your hands, I leave it to the pub|lick to Judge, whether of us ought to be char|ged, if the War continue, with the fatal Ca|lamities
<PB N="416" REF="216"> and terrible misfortunes that will accom|pany it, and whether we have not done on our &s;ide, all that our honour would permit us, to prevent them. I pray God &s;o to di&s;po&s;e your Hearts as to make &s;erious Reflections upon the true intere&s;t of Prote&s;tants, and to con&s;ider how much it will be expo&s;ed to the rage of its Ene|mies if the War continue.

<P>This Letter extremely &s;urprized the States, they thinking it a very hard and &s;en&s;ible thing to the United Provinces, that the <HI>English</HI> &s;hould pretend to have all re&s;tored that had been taken from them, without being willing to re&s;tore any thing they had been taken from the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The States therefore in order once more to &s;hew all the fair appearances of Ju&s;tice on their &s;ide, and of the pretended &s;incere de&s;ire they had for Peace, cau&s;|ed remarks to be made upon the King of Great <HI>Britain</HI>'s Letter, tending to ju&s;tify their Conduct, and to an&s;wer &s;eparately to the Five points that were there advanced, and &s;ent them to the King joined with the following Letter.</P>

<HEAD>The States An&s;wer to the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Let|ter of the 14th. of <HI>October 1666.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have received your Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer da|ted from <HI>Whitehall</HI> the 4th. of <HI>October</HI> Old Stile, or on the 14th. of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, to the Let|ter we writ you dated on the 16th. of <HI>Septem|ber;</HI> and tho' at the very beginning of your Let|ter, your Maje&s;ty endeavours to ju&s;tify your Arms again&s;t this State, we believe it to no pur|po&s;e to enter actually into any di&s;pute about that Subject, becau&s;e we are per&s;waded that if your Maje&s;ty would take the pains to peru&s;e the wri|tings
<PB N="417" REF="216"> that have formerly been delivered into the hands of your Mini&s;ters, and that have been like|wi&s;e made publick, that you would be undoubted|ly convinced, as well as all the World, of the Ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, and of the Motives that engaged us to our own defence.</P>
<P>As to the five points in the Conclu&s;ion of your Maje&s;ty's &s;aid an&s;wer, we are in a State to pro|te&s;t by the faith of men of Honour, that we have not violated the la&s;t Treaty in any of its parts, and that we will engage for the future, inviola|bly to ob&s;erve the Peace, in ca&s;e it be made, praying your Maje&s;ty moreover, to &s;et your &s;elf at re&s;t in that re&s;pect, and to be plea&s;ed to give order, that it be punctually ob&s;erved on your part.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, tho' your Maje&s;ty's Mi|ni&s;ters and particularly Agent <HI>Selwyn,</HI> publi&s;hed upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africk</HI> a Declaration without Contradiction, more imperious, and injurious, than that which ours could have invented, and much le&s;s have put in execution, as has been made amply to appear el&s;ewhere, yet we have &s;ilence thereupon, and we have not been ob&s;erved to make any noi&s;e about it in the World. How|ever, to &s;hew that we are ready to remove that ob&s;tacle we con&s;ent that the two above&s;aid De|clarations &s;hall be both di&s;annull'd and di&s;avow'd as well on your Maje&s;ty's part, as on ours.</P>
<P>To the third, that we are no le&s;s inclin'd than your Maje&s;ty, to con&s;ent to a Regulation of Commerce, provided it be General and Recipro|cal, being hardly able to conceive that your Ma|je&s;ty would refu&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI> and el&s;ewhere, what you pretend to be Equitably your due in the Ea&s;t-<HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>To the fourth, that tho' we are &s;o far from being in a Condition to con&s;ent to a Re-imbur&s;|ment for the charges of the War, or the da|mages &s;uffered by your Maje&s;ty or your Subjects
<PB N="418" REF="217"> that on the contrary, we have right to pretend the re&s;titutien of the Ships and effects of our good Subjects, &s;topt in the Harbors or upon the Ri|vers of your Maje&s;ties Kingdom, or that were taken at Sea by &s;urprize, upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England;</HI> as likewi&s;e of <HI>New-Holland, Cabo Cor&s;o,</HI> and o|ther places taken in <HI>Africk,</HI> without publi&s;hing before hand any Declaration of War, and in the time when our &s;aid Ships entred into your Ma|je&s;ty's Ports, tru&s;ting in the publick faith of a Treaty of Peace, in confidence in the &s;incere De|claration which you had cau&s;ed to be &s;everal times reiterated to us by your Mini&s;ters that re&s;ided then at the <HI>Hague,</HI> namely, that we ought not to take any umbrage at your Maje&s;ty's Arming, nor in any manner to apprehend the meeting of any of your Maje&s;ty's Ships of War, adding that your Maje&s;ty &s;hould always abhor the Conduct of the u&s;urper <HI>Cromwel</HI> towards us, and would never enterprize any thing again&s;t the Liberty of the State, and of its Subjects; but that if it &s;hould happen that your Maje&s;ty could receive no &s;atisfaction upon the Complaints that &s;hould be made to us on your part, that as a Generous Prince you would Declare War again&s;t the State, before a|ny Act of Ho&s;tility were Committed. However it be, we &s;hall be always ready to &s;tand to the Terms of the &s;aid Declaration, if any thing mu&s;t be expected of us.</P>
<P>As to the fifth, which is that your Maje&s;ty would make a Difficulty to tru&s;t to our Word or Seal, tho' on our &s;ide we were ready to tru&s;t to your Maje&s;ty's, we &s;hall readily agree to any other propo&s;ition to render it the more firm and inviolable by the Guarantie of other Princes or States that are Friends or Allies.</P>
<P>But &s;ince your Maje&s;ty te&s;tifies by your An|&s;wer above annexed, that you have &s;ome grounds to hope to induce us to a particular Treaty, to the exclu&s;ion of our Allies, we find our &s;elves
<PB N="419" REF="217"> obliged to adverti&s;e you, that that cannot be, and con&s;equently, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in Order to come to a good Peace, that your Maje&s;ty de|termine to treat joyntly with us and our Con|federates, and that you mu&s;t needs di&s;po&s;e your &s;elf to con&s;ent that choice be made of a Neu|ter place where the Plenipotentiaries as well of the Crowns of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Denmark,</HI> as tho&s;e of your Maje&s;ty may jointly with ours meet with all Liberty, without which all the pains that can be taken about it, will be to no purpo&s;e, becau&s;e we are re&s;olved to remain in&s;eparably linkt to our Allies, and to hearken to no propo&s;ition that may tend to break our Union, directly or indirectly, and that with &s;o much the more confidence be|cau&s;e we are fully per&s;waded, our Allies will re|main always un&s;haken in the &s;ame mind. We therefore make ardent prayers to God, to be plea&s;ed to incline your Maje&s;ty to a thing that is a Preliminary, without which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to come to a Peace; and we hope when affairs &s;hall once be placed upon a good foot, we &s;hall have new rea&s;ons to redouble our Zeal, and to put up prayers for the pro&s;perity of your Maje&s;ty's reign.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>However all hopes of being able to effect a Peace that year vani&s;ht to nothing, and the Uni|ted Provinces began to labour vigorou&s;ly in refit|ing and remanning out their Fleet. And for that end they re&s;olved to keep their Seamen in pay all winter that they might have their full Com|plements of men ready early in the Spring. For they thought it good Policy to make that la&s;t ef|fort to oblige <HI>England</HI> to accept a Peace which they called ju&s;t, by endeavouring to obtain by the force of Arms, or by &s;ubtilty of intrigue, what they could not effect by fair means.</P>

<P>The Mini&s;ters of the Crown of <HI>Sweden</HI> coming to the Court of <HI>England</HI> about the latter end of the Year 1666. u&s;ed all the Diligence imaginable in qua|lity of Mediatours, to compo&s;e the Differences among the Princes that were in War. The fir&s;t Step they made in that Affair was, to prevail with the King of <HI>England,</HI> to con&s;ent to the naming of a Neuter Place, where the Plenipotentiaries of each Party might &s;ecurely meet in order to treat of a Peace. After much Pains taken in it, they obliged the States to write the following Letter about that Subject to the King of <HI>England.</HI> The Re&s;pect due to that Prince, obliged the States to make that fir&s;t Advance, whil&s;t the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Swedeland</HI> on the other &s;ide endeavoured their utmo&s;t to per&s;wade his Maje&s;ty to grant their Demand.</P>

<P>WE expre&s;t to your Maje&s;ty in ours of the 26th of <HI>November,</HI> the Rea&s;ons that hindred us from &s;ending our Mini&s;ters to <HI>London</HI> to treat there of a Peace joyntly with the other Plenipotentiaries. And we doubt not but your Maje&s;ty, upon a &s;erious Reflection thereon, will be of the &s;ame Mind with us. But that your Maje&s;ty may not think we neglect any thing on our &s;ide, that may contribute to any thing that may be capable to advance &s;o important a Work, and to give you the cleare&s;t Evidences imaginable of the Sincerity of our Intentions upon this Subject, we were willing to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty by the&s;e Pre|&s;ents, That the In&s;tances we have made hitherto, to per&s;wade you to name a Neuter Place, does not at all concern our particular Intere&s;ts; Nay, and we prote&s;t, That if that Affair concerned us in parti|cular, we would take Pride in pa&s;&s;ing by all Forma|lities, by heartily con&s;enting that our Differences might be terminated any where, where&s;oever it &s;hould plea&s;e

We have therefore thought fit, for the facilitating &s;o Holy a Work, to pray your Maje&s;ty by this Letter to con&s;ider this Af|fair as it is really at the Bottom, and at length to be plea&s;ed to let the Treaty be carried on in a Neuter-place, where the Plenipotentiaries of each Party may meet.

<P>HAving received yours of the 13th of this Month, by the Hands of the Amba&s;&s;adour Extraordina|ry of the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> by which you repeat your pre&s;&s;ing In&s;tances, to induce us to name a Place where the Plenipotentiaries of the Princes engaged in the

<P>The <HI>Hague</HI> being thus cho&s;en by the King of <HI>En|gland,</HI> for the Negotiation of a Peace; the States, for particular Rea&s;ons approved not that Choice, but writ again about that Subject, to pray him to be plea&s;ed to name another Place; repre&s;enting to him, That &s;ince his Maje&s;ty upon the In&s;tances made to him to per&s;uade him to con&s;ent to a Neuter Place, had had the Goodne&s;s to do them the Honour to will that the Peace &s;hould be treated on in their Country,
<PB N="423" REF="219"> they a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves, That his Maje&s;ty would make no Difficulty to &s;end his Mini&s;ters to <HI>Ma|&s;tricht, Boi&s;leduc, Breda,</HI> &amp;c. However the other Allied Princes were not content neither with that la&s;t Choice; for the <HI>French</HI> King refu&s;ed to accept of the 3 Places the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had la&s;t named, and would rather have <HI>Dover</HI> cho&s;en for the Negotia|tion. The Amba&s;&s;adours of <HI>Swedeland</HI> perceiving that all tho&s;e Nicities of <HI>France</HI> were not at all &s;ea|&s;onable at that time, laboured &s;o hard with that Court, that at la&s;t <HI>Breda</HI> was accepted, whither all the Plenipotentiaries being come, in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> the fir&s;t Conference began in the Ca&s;tle the 4th of <HI>June</HI> 1667.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Surinam</HI> taken by the <HI>Zea|landers.</HI></NOTE> Whil&s;t they were bu&s;ie in Regu|lating the Preliminaries of the Treaty, a Squadron of Men of War that was &s;ent by the States of <HI>Zea|land</HI> into <HI>America,</HI> under the Conduct of Comma|dore <HI>Kryu&s;en,</HI> made &s;trange Depredations there.

In the mean while the <HI>English,</HI> whether they were enfeebled by their great Lo&s;&s;es by War, Fire and Plague, or whether that Court was blinded by fal&s;e and treacherous Coun&s;els, which latter was mo&s;t probable, neglected to arm out their Fleet that Year, and appeared not at all in the <HI>Channel,</HI> but in &s;mall Squadrons and Convoys. But the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet to the Number of 60 Sail of Men of War,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet &s;ails out, and makes to|wards the <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> be&s;ides tho&s;e of <HI>Zealand</HI> and <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> which had not yet joyn'd them, &s;et &s;ail the 11th of <HI>June</HI> under the Command of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> accompanied with Mr. <HI>Cornelius de Wit,</HI> Deputy of the States, and Brother to the Great Pen&s;ionary of that Name: They &s;teered their Cour&s;e towards the River of <HI>London,</HI> with a De&s;ign not only to go and attack the
<PB N="424" REF="220"> <HI>English</HI> in their Harbours, but likewi&s;e to make a De&s;cent &s;ome where to ravage the Country. For that effect they held a Council of War to con&s;ult by what means they might run &s;ome light Frigats a con|&s;iderable way up the River, to go and burn the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Ships that were there. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI> was cho&s;en for that Expedition, for which they gave him the Command of a Squadron formed out of the Detachments made from the Grand Fleet. It was compo&s;ed of 6 Men of War, 1 Advice-yacht, and 2 Fire&s;hips of the Admiralty of the <HI>Meu&s;e;</HI> of 11 Men of War, 4 Advice-Yachts, and 2 Fire&s;hips of the Admiralty of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> and 13 Galliots. The next Morning, being the 19th of <HI>June,</HI> Lieu|tenant Admiral <HI>de Gent,</HI> and Mr. <HI>de Wit,</HI> Deputy of the States, went up the <HI>Thames</HI> at the Head of that Detachment, and by an Enterpri&s;e they went &s;o much the boldlier upon, becau&s;e they were well informed, They &s;hould meet with little Oppo&s;ition, revenged the Mi&s;chief the <HI>English</HI> had done before in the I&s;les of <HI>&V;lie,</HI> and <HI>Schelling;</HI> as appears by the Report the &s;aid Mr. <HI>de Wit</HI> made of that Action to the States,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cornelius de Wit</HI>'s Letter to the States, about the <HI>Duthc</HI> go|ing up the River of <HI>Thames.</HI></NOTE> in the Letters he writ them on that &s;ubject; the &s;ub&s;tance of which imported, <Q REND="inline">That on the 17th in&s;tant the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet coming to an An|chor at the Mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> as they were con|&s;ulting with the general Officers of the Fleet, what Enterpri&s;e to go upon, having received Advice by a Pilot of a <HI>Norway</HI> Ship, coming from <HI>London,</HI> That 10 or 12 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Frigats, carrying from 30 to 40 Guns apiece, together with about 20 Mer|chant Ships, outwards bound to the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> were riding at Anchor in the <HI>Hope,</HI> near <HI>Grave&s;|end,</HI> it was re&s;olved they &s;hould go and attack them, and to endeavour to de&s;troy or take them. And for that effect a Detachment was made from the Fleet, of 17 Light Frigats, 5 Advice-yachts, &s;ome Galliots, and &s;ome Boats. That on the 19th, about 4 in the Morning, the Wind being turned about to the South-We&s;t, they were forced to luff,
<PB N="425" REF="220"> and afterwards con&s;trained by that contrary Wind to ca&s;t Anchor: <MILESTONE N="1667"> But that the Wind chopping about at length to the South-Ea&s;t, was more fa|vourable to them; which made them re&s;olve to unmoor, without any further Lo&s;s of Time, in Hopes to execute their Enterpri&s;e that &s;ame Even|ing: But the Wind &s;lackning, they were forced to &s;top a Mile and a half &s;hort of the <HI>Hope,</HI> which gave Time to the <HI>English</HI> Ships to e&s;cape away. However, to Day, <HI>continues he,</HI> about Noon, as the Tide begun to come in, we advanced as far as the Mouth of the River of <HI>Chattam.</HI> We pre|&s;ently gave Order to the Land-Troops and Marine Soldiers to make a De&s;cent, and to attack the Fort of <HI>Sheerne&s;s;</HI> In the mean while we advanced with our Men of War, and anchored before the &s;ame Fort. At our Approach, one of the King's Fri|gats with &s;ome other Ve&s;&s;els,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort of <HI>Sheer|ne&s;s taken.</HI></NOTE> and &s;ome Fire&s;hips that were there, betook them&s;elves to Flight, and the Men in the Fort ran away likewi&s;e before our Troops got thither; &s;o that after the Fort had been cannonaded about an Hour and an half, our Sea|men &s;caled it to pull down from thence the <HI>English</HI> Banner. We found there 15 Pieces of Cannon, which we carried off to our Ships; and a great Magazine of Ma&s;ts, Yards, and in general of all Nece&s;&s;aries for the Rigging of Ships, valued at near 400000 <HI>Livers.</HI> We gave Order to all our Captains, to carry each of them on Board them a good quantity, and to &s;et Fire to the re&s;t. Becau&s;e the mo&s;t part of our Land-Troops were &s;eparated from us by the foul Weather, the Gene|ral Officers thought not fit to engage them&s;elves too far up the Country with &s;o few People, or el&s;e they might have done a great deal of Mi&s;chief. We are however of Opinion, to keep the River of <HI>London</HI> blocked up, and to hinder the Pa&s;&s;age of Ships there as much as 'tis po&s;&s;ible for us. And for that effect, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> is to come up and joyn us with the Main Body of the Fleet.</Q></P>

For tho' he commanded but a &s;orry Frigat, ill manned and equipp'd, yet he undertook alone to go up and burn the <HI>English</HI> Men of War, &s;o that being advanced with all imaginable Re&s;olution, without firing a Gun, he endured all the Enemies greate&s;t Fire. He was &s;carcely arrived within Musket &s;hot of an <HI>En|glish</HI> Man of War, but that he fired a Broad-&s;ide at her, and falling upon her at the &s;ame time, by the Favour of the Wind, grappled her and took her, with the Lo&s;s only of 3 Men. A <HI>Dutch</HI> Fire&s;hip grappled likewi&s;e another <HI>English</HI> Man of War of 52 Guns and burnt her. That Di&s;a&s;ter &s;truck &s;uch a Con&s;ternation into the Enemies, that a part of the <HI>Royal Charles</HI>'s Men fled away, and the re&s;t jumped into the Water. We took with the Help of our Boats, without any Re&s;i&s;tance, another <HI>English</HI> Ship, called <HI>Charles the Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">th</HI> of 50 Guns, but being
<PB N="428" REF="222"> grappled by one of our Fire-Ships, &s;he blew up in the night. The &s;hip call'd the Fort of <HI>Hunningen</HI> being de|&s;erted by her men that fled away in Boats was taken: &s;he carried 70 Bra&s;s Guns; but &s;he was unfortunate|ly burnt contrary to the Orders we had given. This lo&s;s was followed with that of another very con&s;iderable <HI>English</HI> Ship which we likewi&s;e de|&s;troyed with the Flames. Ye&s;terday we percei|ved 3 more above us which we hope to de&s;troy to day; the Water was &s;o low that it was im|po&s;&s;ible for us to get up to them. However the North wind continuing to blow, and the re&s;t of our Fire-Ships that were &s;cattered from the Flag being veer'd back again towards the Admiral, we gave them orders to go up and burn them. And tho' it &s;eemed, that <HI>&V;pton Ca&s;tle</HI> &s;ituated upon the River &s;ide, might have oppo&s;ed that enterprize, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age being very narrow in that place, our men mu&s;t have been forced to have endu|red its fire, yet in &s;pite of all tho&s;e ob&s;tacles, the bu&s;ine&s;s was carried on with &s;o much prudence, that we burnt them to day about 3 in the after|noon. Tho&s;e 3 Ships were the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in all the <HI>English</HI> Navy, they were named <HI>the Loyal London, the Royal James,</HI> and <HI>the Loy|al Oak.</HI> Mr. <HI>de Wit</HI> adds in the clo&s;e, We have obtained, &s;ays he, all the&s;e Glorious advantages hitherto without the lo&s;s of above 150 men. We are at pre&s;ent re&s;olved to go down the River, to join the Main Body of our Fleet. According to the advices we have, all the Kingdom is in A|larm, and they are there A&s;&s;embling a great Num|ber of Troops; But all that is not able to inti|midate us. However becau&s;e mo&s;t of our Fire-Ships have been &s;pent, we pray the States to give Order that we may have more. All our Officers both General and Inferiour have Signaliz'd them|&s;elves, and given proofs of an unparallelled Bra|very. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Aylva</HI>'s Squadron, has joined the Admiral's Flag, &s;o that the Fleet is Re|inforced
<PB N="429" REF="222"> with a Con&s;iderable Number of Ships of War, and we have nothing more to do but to put up prayers for the continuation of the pro&s;perities with which it has plea&s;ed God hitherto to ble&s;s the Arms of the State.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York</HI> and General <HI>Monk</HI> were the melancholick Spectatours of the Expedition, and according to the report of &s;ome Pri&s;oners, they had been but the day before on Board tho&s;e 3 Ships that were la&s;t burnt. Retiring to <HI>Roche|&s;ter</HI> they were in an unconceivable vexation, to &s;ee the Fine&s;t and Riche&s;t Ships of all their Fleet de&s;troyed &s;o &s;trangely, and they in no Conditi|on to put a &s;top to tho&s;e terrible Ravages of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> There were &s;everal other Ships and Fire-Ships likewi&s;e lo&s;t, which the <HI>English</HI> them|&s;elves &s;unk in the River of <HI>Chattam,</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;top the <HI>Hollanders</HI> pa&s;&s;age, and be&s;ides them were lo&s;t 8 of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable men of War in the whole <HI>English</HI> Fleet: Which made both Court and Country exclaim again&s;t tho&s;e pernici|ous Councellors that had advi&s;ed the King to be amu&s;ed &s;o far with the hopes of a Peace, as to venture to treat without Sword in hand, and af|ter &s;o great a Victory as he had had the la&s;t time over the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be per&s;waded under pretence of &s;aving Money, not to put his Fleet out, when it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for the obtaining an advanta|geous Peace, and of pre&s;erving the Honour and Reputation the Nation had gotten at &s;o dear an expence in two con&s;ecutive <HI>Dutch</HI> Wars, which now was by one of the greate&s;t over&s;ights ima|ginable in Policy ob&s;cured and tarni&s;ht all at one bla&s;t, and never &s;ince recovered it &s;elf altogether to its former Lu&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;urprizing and heavy mi&s;chiefs much A|larmed and imbittered the people. So that an in&s;urrection was feared in <HI>Kent,</HI> and about <HI>Ro|che&s;ter.</HI> Upon which the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and Ge|neral <HI>Monk</HI> apprehending lea&s;t tho&s;e glowing Sparks
<PB N="430" REF="223"> might if not timely quencht kindle into an Uni|ver&s;al Conflragation that might endanger the Go|vernment, thought it be&s;t to &s;tifle them in time by &s;ending with &s;peed a good Body of Troops both Hor&s;e and Foot, down to the Coa&s;ts, as well to awe the Mutinous People as to oppo&s;e the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> However the whole Storm of the publick di&s;content fell afterwards upon Chancel|lor <HI>Hyde,</HI> as being the reputed Author of tho&s;e Coun&s;els that were &s;uppo&s;ed to have cau&s;ed all tho&s;e ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es, &s;o that he was forced to flie into Exile, to avoid a wor&s;e de&s;tiny, from which the King his Ma&s;ter could not have protected him without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to the extreame&s;t dan|ger. In the mean while the Common Opinion a|mong the People in <HI>Holland</HI> was, that the&s;e new attempts in&s;tead of di&s;po&s;ing the States to a Peace would have kindled fiercer flames of War, and have made the two Nations irreconcilable; But experience quickly &s;hew'd the contrary the Nego|ation for Peace at <HI>Breda,</HI> was thereupon all on a &s;ud|den further advanced than it had been in many con|ferences before.</P>
<P>On the 25th. of the Month, it was re&s;olved in a Council of War held on board the Fleet, to detach away Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI> with a Squadron of 22 Sail of Men of War and Fire-Ships, towards the North, as well to endeavour to &s;eize upon the I&s;le of <HI>Hitland,</HI> as to cruize for the Ships that were expected from the Ea&s;t-<HI>Indies.</HI> But as for <HI>De Ruiter</HI> with the Re&s;t of the Fleet, they went and Anchoured before the I&s;le of <HI>Sheppey,</HI> where they Land|ed Four or Five hundred men, who advanced into the Country without Re&s;i&s;tance, and brought off to the Fleet, a great quantity of Refre&s;hments of all &s;orts.</P>
<PB N="431" REF="223">
<P>The Count <HI>de Hoorn</HI> was afterwards &s;ent with his Regiment on board the Fleet, and <HI>de Ruiter</HI> received orders, to remount the <HI>Thames,</HI> in order to attempt &s;ome further enterprize. For which effect, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Bankert</HI> who was newly come to the Fleet with a Reinforcement of &s;ome Ships from <HI>Zealand,</HI> was Commanded with a Squa|dron of 14 of the lighte&s;t Ships, and 2 Fire-Ships to advance near <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and do all the mi&s;chief he could. But that new enterprize had no &s;uc|ce&s;s, but only &s;erved to augment the con&s;terna|tion that was already among the inhabitants of <HI>London,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>English</HI> had &s;unk &s;o many Ships to &s;top up the pa&s;&s;age of the <HI>Thames,</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible for the <HI>Dutch</HI> to make any advance; and be&s;ides the Batteries of Great Cannon that were rai&s;ed all along on both &s;ides the River fired &s;o hotly upon the Ships that ventured within their reach, that <HI>Bankert</HI> was forced to retire, and veer back towards the Admiral.</P>
<P>The Fleet then having been Reinforced by the Troops brought by the Count <HI>de Hoorn,</HI> the Ge|nerals thought fit to attack the Fort near <HI>Har|wich,</HI> the principal Circum&s;tances of which Acti|on are Related in the Letter Mr. <HI>de Wit</HI> writ concerning it to the States, of which here follows the extract.</P>
<Q><P><HI>I</HI> Having repre&s;ented to all the Officers of the fleet that it was fit the States Troops &s;hould be em|ployed in &s;ome remarkable Expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Harwich Fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">|med.</NOTE> and &s;everal Per&s;ons in the Fleet pretending they had particular knowledge of the Fort of <HI>Harwich,</HI> the General Of|ficers thereupon re&s;olved to detach <HI>1600</HI> Land-Soldiers and <HI>400</HI> Seamen, under the Conduct of Rear Admiral <HI>Vlug,</HI> and the Captains <HI>Swart</HI> and <HI>Luz,</HI> and that being divided into equal Companies at <HI>12</HI> in a Company, <HI>4</HI> of each Company &s;hould be cho&s;en to throw Granado's, and the re&s;t &s;hould car|ry Scaling-Ladders, and Axes to cut down the Pa|li&s;ado's,
<PB N="432" REF="224"> if they met with any. Things being thus order'd, we cau&s;ed Vice Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> to advance with <HI>14</HI> men of War, <HI>1</HI> Advice Yacht, and two fire-Ships, to attack the fort on one &s;ide, which Squadron was divided into two Parts. And Rear Admiral <HI>Van Nes</HI> had order to enter the Bay with <HI>6</HI> men of War, to approach nearer the fort, whil&s;t Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> &s;hould vigorou&s;ly attack it on another &s;ide. When the &s;ignal was gi|ven the Troops were tran&s;ported to &s;hore in Boats and Galliots, with all imaginable &s;peed. Ob&s;erving, that Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> who was to attackt the fort before, kept at too great a di&s;tance from the Ramparts, and that Rear-Admiral <HI>Van Nes</HI> went not into the Haven, as had been projected, we Re|&s;olved, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and I, to go up to them, and make them advance. But when we came there, we found it impo&s;&s;ible for Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> to get any nearer, and upon the Report made to us by the Soldiers we &s;ent to <HI>Van Nes,</HI> that there was no going in on that &s;ide, the Boom being cut, we re|&s;olved to &s;end in &s;ome Boats to &s;ound the pa&s;&s;age, but the Tide going off, and a Calm coming on, it was impo&s;&s;ible to execute any thing. <HI>Evert&s;z</HI> approach|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng as near the Ramparts as he could po&s;&s;ibly, fired at the fort, but the shot he made had but very little effect, becau&s;e it was almo&s;t out of his reach: Whereas the Ca&s;tle fired vigorou&s;ly on their &s;ide up|on his men of War. When we &s;aw nothing con&s;i|derable could be done on that &s;ide, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and I took a Boat and went on shore to the Troops there, which we found there drawn up in order of Battle, and waiting till the men of War were got in: And after we had related to them the ob&s;tacles we met with, we re&s;olved to make them advance and to attack the fort vigorou&s;ly by Land, &s;ince 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible to do it by Water. The Generals thought fit to leave a body of foot under the Conduct of the Count <HI>de Hoorn,</HI> to guard a certain pa&s;&s;age, as well to &s;ecure our Boats as preven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Enemies from fal|ling
<PB N="433" REF="224"> upon us behind. When all things were ready we marcht our Troops towards the fort, and when we were come very nigh it the Seamen that carri|ed the Scaling Ladders, had others to advance; in the mean while, the Enemy fired &s;o terribly with their &s;mall arms both from the Fort, and from a Galliot that was in the Harbour, that our Officers, after they had examined more nearly the works of the Fort, finding there was no appearance of their being able to take it, re&s;olved to Retire; which was done in good Order. The body of Foot that was po&s;ted to guard the pa&s;&s;age was vigorou&s;|ly attackt by the Enemies Hor&s;e and Foot, but were received &s;o briskly by them, that after a long and ob|&s;tinate fight, they were forced to retire with lo&s;s.</P>
<P>That attempt having thus failed, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> ad|vanced higher up the River and made the Ships of his fleet be&s;pread the whole breadth of it that they quite blockt up its pa&s;&s;age. Rear-Admiral <HI>Vander Zaan</HI> was ordered to stay with <HI>8</HI> men of War, at the mouth of the Harbour of <HI>Harwich,</HI> to ob&s;erve the Enemies Ships coming or going to and from the Northward, and Vice-Admiral <HI>Evert&s;z,</HI> and <HI>Star</HI> were &s;ent towards the <HI>North-Foreland,</HI> to hinder the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> from coming in on that &s;ide.</P></Q>
<P>In the mean while this &s;trange and indirect pro|ceeding of the States Forces made a great change in the Negotiation for Peace that was managing at <HI>Breda.</HI> For the States Plenipotentiaries &s;tuck not to &s;ay, <HI>That the advantages their Arms had newly obtained, might perhaps make their Ma&s;ters alter their minds; That however they con&s;ented to conclude a Peace upon the conditions that had been pre&s;ented, but that they could not an&s;wer for its Ratification. And that it was not to be imagi|ned, the States and their Allies &s;hould &s;tand to the offers that had been made, if God cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nued to ble&s;s their Arms with new Conque&s;ts.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> Aim|ing by that Declaration, to oblige the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to

And the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Plenipo|tentiaries appeared likewi&s;e much more inclinable to Peace than they had done before, and the Differen|ces as well with the States, as with the Kings of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Denmark</HI> were at la&s;t terminated on the 10th. of <HI>July;</HI> &s;ave only that Mr. <HI>Coventry</HI> one of His <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty's Plenipotentiaries was obliged to go back with all &s;peed to <HI>London</HI> to get &s;ome points agreed to, which it was not in their power to decide.</P>
<P>The news of a Conclu&s;ion of the Peace was brought to the Fleet the 14th. of the &s;ame month, and yet becau&s;e it was not fully ratified, &s;uch was then the in&s;olence of the then <HI>Love&s;tenian</HI> Go|vernment, for which they afterwards paid dear, that orders were &s;ent for all that, next day to <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> to continue &s;till to do all the mi&s;chief he could upon the <HI>English</HI> Coa&s;ts, becau&s;e the Peace was not yet fully concluded. Upon that advice the Fleet was divided the &s;ame day into 2 Squadrons, whereof 1 under the Command of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Nes,</HI> was ordered to block up the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and the other un|der the Command of <HI>de Ruiter</HI> in per&s;on Quitted the <HI>Thames</HI> to go a cruizing along the Channel to infe&s;t the &s;everal Ports of the Kingdom there.</P>
<P>On the 18th <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadron pa&s;&s;ed the Strait of <HI>Callis,</HI> and the next day advanced right a|gain&s;t the <HI>Singels</HI> without meeting any Ship. But the <HI>English Barbado's</HI> and <HI>Smirna</HI> Fleets which they had flattered them&s;elves with the hopes of taking, were got &s;afe into Port before they could reach them. Seeing then they had mi&s;t their de&s;i|red prey, they re&s;olved next to attack <HI>Torbay,</HI> where there were 2 Merchant Ships. Which enterprize
<PB N="435" REF="225"> put all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>England</HI> &s;o much the more in alarm, becau&s;e <HI>de Ruiter</HI> having divided his Squa|ron into &s;everal bodies, made them appear in &s;e|veral places at one time, which &s;o perplext the <HI>English</HI> that they knew not which way to bend their Force to hinder a de&s;cent. On the 8th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> having received a Reinforcement of 7 men of War, and 8 Fire-Ships, he &s;ailed as far as <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> upon advice he had received that a good Number of <HI>English</HI> men of War were there a&s;|&s;embling. The next day towards evening, a Boat came out of <HI>Plymouth</HI> carrying a White Flag, which came directly to <HI>de Ruiter</HI> to tell him the News of a Peace. There were in it two <HI>Eng|lish</HI> Colonels accompanied with two other Gentle|men who came on board the Admiral, and told him that Peace was Concluded between <HI>England,</HI> and the United Provinces; after which they made him great prote&s;tations of Amity, praying him to order all Acts of Ho&s;tility to cea&s;e. They complained at the &s;ame time of the fight that had newly hapned on the <HI>Thames</HI> between Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Nes,</HI> and &s;ome of the King's Ships; and how that, contrary to the Peace, many of their Ships had been endamaged, and &s;everal Fire-Ships burnt to A&s;hes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But <HI>de Ruiter</HI> without taking any notice of all tho&s;e Compliments, thought not fit to di&s;continue his Enterprize as believing the States would not have failed to have informed him of &s;o great a piece of News, if things had been really &s;o as the <HI>English</HI> pretended.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Nes</HI> having received orders from the States, to remount the River of <HI>London</HI> and to go and attack the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> men of War and Fire-Ships that were in the <HI>Hope,</HI> and to keep the <HI>English</HI> in a perpetual alarm, &s;et &s;ail accordingly with his Squadron, on the 2d. of <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> and found there Admiral <HI>Spragg</HI> with 5 Fri|gats, 17 Fire-Ships, and a great many &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els.

The States fore|&s;eeing, that <HI>France</HI> would not fail to conceive an Umbrage at it, and that Ambitious Crown being Jealous at all the precautions taken by tho&s;e Po|wers for their own &s;ecurity, might afterwards per|haps endeavour to &s;eek its Revenge upon &s;ome of them, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure them&s;elves from that danger, by Uniting them&s;elves more &s;trictly with <HI>England</HI> which they did by a Defen|&s;ive
<PB N="440" REF="228"> Alliance with Sir <HI>William Temple</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador from his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty at the <HI>Hague.</HI> The fir&s;t good effect that Tripple-Alliance produced, was to put a &s;top to the rapid Cour&s;e of the u|&s;urpations of <HI>France</HI> in the Low-Countries, by &s;etting bounds to its Ambition.</P>
<P>For the <HI>French</HI> King knew &s;o well how to make his advantage of the late War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> which he had fomented for his own ends, that he took that opportunity, to &s;urprize the weak <HI>Spaniards</HI> then under an infant King, and to wre&s;t &s;everal important places from them in the Low-Countries, contrary to the Faith of the Treaties on foot between the two Crowns. But the Tri|ple-Alliance forced him to lay down his Arms, &s;o that on the 2d. of <HI>May,</HI> a Peace was Concluded between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> at <HI>Aix la Chappelle.</HI></P>
<P>After that, the <HI>French</HI> King being much di&s;|gu&s;ted at the Conduct of the States, never left off to &s;eek out occa&s;ion to &s;hew his fierce Re&s;ent|ment. The fir&s;t &s;tep he thought fit to make to|wards it, was to endeavour to break the Famous, and by him &s;o much dreaded Tripple-Alliance, by di|viding the Princes that were engag'd in it. The di&s;|gracefull Ravages and Spoils the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had &s;o unfairly committed on the <HI>English</HI> Coa&s;ts, but chief|ly at <HI>Chattam,</HI> at a time of a Treaty of Peace, as likewi&s;e &s;ome new difficulties about Navigation and Commerce, furni&s;ht him with a hopefull pre|tence, enough to work withal upon the King of <HI>England;</HI> there wanted only a dextrous Per&s;on to be cho&s;en that might be fit to per&s;wade his <HI>Bri|tannick</HI> Maje&s;ty. And as the <HI>French</HI> have always been &s;ucce&s;sfull in employing the Mini&s;tery of Females in their mo&s;t important Negotiations, becau&s;e they are more in&s;inuating, and flatter generally with a more powerfull and irre&s;i&s;tible influence than men; &s;o accordingly the Dutche&s;s of <HI>Orleans,</HI> Si&s;ter to that Prince, was pitcht upon to pa&s;s to the Court of <HI>England,</HI> to manage that nice affair. She &s;et out
<PB N="441" REF="228"> then in the month of <HI>June</HI> 1670,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> accompanied with a great many <HI>French</HI> Lords, under pretence of making a vi&s;it to the King her Brother. The States were not long before they perceived what blow the <HI>French</HI> were de&s;igning at them. For they well enough fore&s;aw that the Voyage of the Dutche&s;s was intended only to break the Trip|ple-League; And they had certain Advice, that the <HI>French</HI> King was preparing to march with a po|werfull Army towards <HI>Dunkirk</HI> early in the Spring; be&s;ides all that, they made no Difficulty to &s;ay publickly at <HI>Stockholm,</HI> that if the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould attack the United Provinces upon any other pre|tence than that of the Triple League, that <HI>Swede|land</HI> would not be obliged to a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Court, without declaring them&s;elves openly had already begun to Commit a &s;ort of Ho&s;tility, by laying exce&s;&s;ive impo&s;ts upon all <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchandizes imported into that Kingdom. The States having Complained of it &s;everal times with no effect, re&s;olved at la&s;t to retaliate that u|&s;age, by forbidding the importing any Brandy or <HI>French</HI> Manufactures into their Dominions, hoping by that means to oblige the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to alter his proceedings. And becau&s;e the march of the <HI>French</HI> Army towards <HI>Dunkirk</HI> put them in &s;ome apprehen&s;ion for the Low-Countries, the States re&s;olved al&s;o to have a powerfull Fleet at Sea under the Command of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> both to &s;ecure their Commerce, and to ob&s;erve the motions of the <HI>French.</HI> And be&s;ides they Solli|cited <HI>England</HI> likewi&s;e to put a Fleet to Sea, to joyn with theirs, according to the obliga|tions of the Tripple-League: But King <HI>Charles</HI> gave them already to under&s;tand, that he had quite different aims.</P>
<PB N="442" REF="229">
<P>On the 8th. of <HI>June</HI> 1671. <MILESTONE N="1671"> <HI>de Ruiter</HI> &s;ailed out of the <HI>Men&s;e</HI> with &s;ome men of War, towards <HI>O&s;tend,</HI> near which place, his Fleet was to Rende&s;vouz. It con&s;i&s;ted of 46 men of War, 10 Advice-Yachts, and 6 Fire-Ships. It carried 2379 Guns, 8090 Seamen, and 2768 Soldiers; and was divided into 3 Squadrons, the fir&s;t under the immediate Com|mand of <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> the &s;econd under that of Lieute|nant Admiral <HI>Bankert,</HI> and the third under the Con|duct of Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>de Gent.</HI> Whil&s;t the Fleet was cruizing upon the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Ne|therlands,</HI> it was on the 20th. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> overta|ken with a violent Tempe&s;t, by which &s;everal Ships were endamaged, and that of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> was one of the wor&s;t treated. Two days after, he went and Anchored near <HI>We&s;tkappel,</HI> to Repair and Refit his &s;hattered Ships; from whence he di&s;covered a Yacht, called the <HI>Merlin,</HI> which carried the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Flag on her Main-Ma&s;t-Top. She was come out of the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> and going back for <HI>England,</HI> and as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed throw the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet &s;he &s;aluted <HI>de Ruiter</HI> with &s;ome Guns, but he being bu&s;y in Refiting his Ship, could not make u&s;e of his Guns to an&s;wer his &s;alute. Lieutenant-Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI> perceiving it, rendred the King's Yacht the Honours due to her with a &s;alute of 7 Guns: And in the mean while Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> having made ha&s;t to get his ready, &s;aluted likewi&s;e with 9 Guns; but the <HI>English</HI> made him no return. At the &s;ame time &s;etting Sail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">, he &s;ummoned on board him all the General Officers and Captains of the fleet to inform him what damage they had &s;uffered by the late ill Weather. And then it was that Lieu|tenant Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI> told him, that after he had returned his &s;alute to the Kings Yacht, the <HI>English</HI> Captain fired twice at him with Bullets, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to &s;trike his Flag; that there|upon he &s;ent his Captain on Board the Yacht to know of the Commander the rea&s;ons that o|liged
<PB N="443" REF="229"> him to act in that manner, and that hear|ing that Madam <HI>Temple</HI> was on board her, be|cau&s;e he had had the honour to vi&s;it her at her lodging at the <HI>Hague,</HI> where &s;he had treated him with great civilities, he was minded to go on board the Yacht him&s;elf to pay her his Re&s;pects; and that as he went in, he told the Captain ve|ry civilly, That as for an affair of &s;o great an im|portance as that was, to &s;trike his Flag to one of the King's Yachts, upon their own Coa&s;ts, truely with|out an Expre&s;s Order, he dur&s;t not do it, but that if his <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty had rea&s;on to pre|tend any &s;uch thing, the difference ought to be decided between his Maje&s;ty and the States; and that after that di&s;cour&s;e, they parted good friends, Notwith&s;tanding which, that Rencounter by the <HI>French</HI> was made the Subject of &s;o much noi&s;e and blu&s;tring in <HI>England,</HI> that the States found they had rea&s;on to apprehend very mi&s;chievous Con&s;e|&s;equences from it.</P>
<P>The Campaign the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King was to make near <HI>Dunkirk</HI> having ended in a bare re|view of his Army; The States thought the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> low-Countries had nothing to fear that year, and therefore they re&s;olved to call home their Fleet, to prevent the Tempe&s;ts that begun alrea|dy to reign. And accordingly Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had orders to retire on the 21&s;t. of <HI>September</HI> and the 23d of the &s;ame month, the Fleet went into Port, to be Di&s;armed and laid up.</P>
<P>In the mean while the de&s;igns <HI>France</HI> had for|med again&s;t the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> begun to break out, as likewi&s;e the intelligence the King of <HI>England</HI> had with that Crown; And the States were in|formed from good hands, what Springs the <HI>French</HI> King had &s;et on work to break the Triple League, and that to induce King <HI>Charles</HI> to break out or it, he promi&s;ed to put into the field an Army of 100000 men, and to &s;et out to Sea a Fleet of 40 Sail of men of War. But however the <HI>English</HI> on
<PB N="444" REF="230"> their &s;ide to lull a&s;leep the States, gave them good words.</P>
<P>At the beginning of the Year 1672, <MILESTONE N="1672"> the bu&s;i|ne&s;s about the <HI>Merlin</HI> Yacht was revived again. And Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> was &s;ent to the <HI>Hague</HI> from his <HI>British</HI> Maje&s;ty, to make Complaint of it, and to demand Reparation; adding, that Lieu|tenant Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI> ought to be puni&s;ht. And tho' the 19th. Article of the Treaty at <HI>Breda, That men of War, or Merchants Ships belonging to the &V;nited Provinces, when they &s;hall meet any of the King of</HI> England's <HI>Ships of War in the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Seas, &s;hall be obliged to &s;trike their Flag, and lower their main Top&s;ails as was formerly practi&s;ed</HI> Yer Sir <HI>George Downing</HI> would needs maintain, a|gain&s;t the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to treat with him, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Flag was not to be taken from the Treaty of <HI>Breda,</HI> but from an Ancient right; and that the civilities they rend|red one another, were all times to be Recipro|cal, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Some days after, he delivered in a wri|ting wherein it was a&s;&s;erted, <HI>That the Empire of the Sea belonged to the</HI> Engli&s;h: <HI>That not only every &s;ingle Ship was obliged to &s;trike their Flag, but even whole Fleets: That Lieutenant Admiral</HI> de Gent <HI>had failed in his Duty, and ought to be pu|nished,</HI> &amp;c. All the Rea&s;ons the States could al|ledge, would not &s;atisfie Sir <HI>George Downing,</HI> nor &s;top his ha&s;ty departure.</P>
<P>The States likewi&s;e employed all imaginable means to &s;atisfy the <HI>French</HI> King, but that Prince had taken &s;o &s;trong a Re&s;olution to make War, that nothing was able to divert him from it. Whereupon the States &s;eeing plainly, that all tho&s;e Preparati|ons were making again&s;t the United Provinces, and that the <HI>Netherlands</HI> were going to be made the Theater of a terrible War, they begun to pro|vide for them&s;elves, by rai&s;ing a Fund to defray the va&s;t expences they were like to be engaged in. And
<PB N="445" REF="230"> after deliberations, the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was Cre|ated Captain General of the Armies of the State the 24th of <HI>February,</HI> upon certain conditions not nece&s;&s;ary to be in&s;erted here. The States having enjoyed Peace by Land near 24 years, their Land-Forces were &s;o accu&s;tomed to Idlene&s;s, that they were not like the &s;ame men; and too long a re&s;t had effeminated the Spirits of the Soldiers, that there was no Reliance to be made upon their Service. Therefore Orders were given for new Levies and endeavours were u&s;ed to make Alliances with the Neighbouring Princes for <HI>Auxiliary</HI> Troops. They u&s;ed all diligence to fit out a Fleet of 48 Capital men of War, and 24 Fire-Ships, be&s;ides Galliots and other &s;mall Tenders; which Num|ber was afterwards con&s;iderably Augmented.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the <HI>English</HI> put out a Fleet of 38 men of War, divided into three Squadrons; and the States Agent named <HI>de Clarges,</HI> having di&s;|covered, that their de&s;ign was to go and meet, and attack the <HI>Dutch Smirna</HI> Fleet, one of the riche&s;t they ever had yet, u&s;ed his be&s;t Policy to di&s;appoint the <HI>English;</HI> and for that effect di&s;|patch'd away &s;everal Galliots from <HI>Callis,</HI> to go and give the <HI>Smirna</HI> men notice of it in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Seas; &s;o that upon that Advice, they took their Precautions for their own defence. They were to the Number of 72 &s;ail, including among them 6 men of War, that were their Convoy. When they were come as far as the middle of the Channel a Squadron of 9 <HI>English</HI> Frigats,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch Smirna</HI> Fleet at|tackt by the <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI></NOTE> and 3 Yachts under the Command of Sir <HI>Robert Holms,</HI> came &amp; attackt them.</P>
<P>On the 24th. of <HI>March.</HI> At the &s;ight of the <HI>English,</HI> the Merchant Fleet threw them&s;elves in|to the form of a <HI>Cre&s;cent,</HI> and maintained the fight &s;o vigorou&s;ly for &s;ome hours, that Sir <HI>Robert Holms</HI> was forced to retire from them toward night but the next day having received a Reinforcement of 4 or 5 men of War more, he came up with them again, and charged them a fre&s;h, but with no
<PB N="446" REF="231"> better luck then at the fir&s;t time, and the whole <HI>Smirna</HI> Fleet had e&s;caped, had not the <HI>English,</HI> upon the renewing the fight a third time, hap|ned to take one of the Convoy Ships who&s;e Cap|tain was killed, which was the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s 4 Merchant Ships which were cut off from a Squadron that were put into &s;ome Di&s;order, &s;uch was the end of that fight; And that was all the advantage the <HI>English</HI> gained over them. But the main body of that Merchant Fleet, got in at length &s;afe into the Ports of <HI>Holland.</HI> The Captains, <HI>de Nes</HI> and <HI>de Haas,</HI> who commanded there in chief, lo&s;t their lives there, and Captain <HI>du Bois</HI> had his Left hand &s;hot off</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King Declared War again&s;t the U|nited Provinces the &s;ame day. The pretence of which Declaration was, <HI>That the di&s;plea&s;ure his Maje&s;ty had received from the Conduct of the States General of the &V;nited Provinces for &s;ome time pa&s;t towards him, was come to &s;uch a height, that his Maje&s;ty could no longer di&s;&s;emble his Re|&s;entment, without prejudice to his Glory, and that a proceeding &s;o very un&s;uitable to the great obliga|tions the States had to his Maje&s;ty, and to other Kings his predece&s;&s;ors, had at la&s;t provoked him to take a Re&s;olution to make War again&s;t them by Sea and Land,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The motives that induced the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> and Elector of <HI>Cologne</HI> to joyn with <HI>France</HI> like|wi&s;e in a War again&s;t the States, were not much better founded then tho&s;e of the <HI>French</HI> King. The King of <HI>Swedeland</HI> being then but very young, had not experience enough to avoid &s;uffer|ing him&s;elf to be impo&s;ed upon by the promi&s;es of <HI>France,</HI> quitted likewi&s;e the Engagements he had with his Allies, in prejudice to the Tripple-League.</P>
<P>The United Provinces then &s;eeing them&s;elves thus without any &s;econd, and all alone engaged in a danger of a very fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">midable a&s;pect, fell into Great extreamities. For the <HI>French</HI> King en|tring
<PB N="447" REF="231"> their Country with a very Numerous and well di&s;ciplined Army, took Town after Town without Re&s;i&s;tance; whil&s;t the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun|&s;ter,</HI> and Elector of <HI>Cologne,</HI> attackt the States on another &s;ide, and finding the places open, were no le&s;s Victorious than their Great Allie. In fine, &s;uch was the rapidity of their progre&s;&s;es, that of &s;even Provinces, three were already fallen into the hands of the Enemies; And if the affairs of the United Provinces had &s;ucceeded &s;o de&s;pe|rately ill at Sea, as they had done at Land, it may be &s;aid, that in all humane appearance, they had been ir|retrievably lo&s;t. For after &s;uch great lo&s;&s;es, what could they expect but a Total Ruine? but be|cau&s;e tho&s;e Events do but indirectly concern our Subject, and that they have been already very largely and fully related by &s;everal Hi&s;torians, we &s;hall leave them to return to &s;peak only of the Actions that hapned at Sea.</P>
<P>They had wrought with &s;o much diligence in arming out the Fleet in <HI>Holland,</HI> that it was rea|dy on the 9th. of <HI>May,</HI> to &s;et &s;ail. And the vigilence and care of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> and Pen&s;ionary <HI>de Wit,</HI> contributed very much to that &s;ucce&s;sfull advance. It &s;et &s;ail then under the Conduct of Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and <HI>Cornelius de Wit.</HI> Depu|ty of the States, con&s;i&s;ting of 67 &s;ail, which Num|ber was &s;oon was &s;oon after Augmented, by a Reinforcement of &s;everal Ships more. On the 14th. day of the &s;ame month, the two Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> joined likewi&s;e near the I&s;le of <HI>Wight;</HI> And the &s;ame day the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet &s;ailed towards the Coa&s;ts of Great <HI>Britain,</HI> where they Anchored till the 7th. of <HI>June</HI> being Com|po&s;ed then of 91 men of War, 44 Fire-Ships, and 23 Advice-Yachts, making in all, 158 &s;ail. Then weighing Anchor they arrived at break of day at <HI>Solbay.</HI> The Confederate Fleets that were above 100 &s;ail &s;trong of men of War, had as the <HI>Dutch</HI> Relations Repre&s;ent things, &s;everal times
<PB N="448" REF="232"> already avoided Battle. But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having di&s;|covered them&s;elves, pre&s;ented them &s;o unexpectedly and &s;uddenly before the bay, that &s;everal of the Enemies Ships were forced to cut their Anchor-Cables to get out to range them&s;elves timely in a Line of Battle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A fight be|tween <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and the <HI>Eng|lish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ets.</NOTE> The two Royal Fleets were like|wi&s;e divided into three Squadrons. The Duke of <HI>York,</HI> as Lord High Admiral of the Kingdom, had the Command of the main Battle, or of the Red Squadron; The Count <HI>d' Etrees</HI> Vice-Ad|miral of <HI>France</HI> Commanded the Right Wing, or the White Squadron; and Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> had the Conduct of the Left Wing, or Blue Squadron. Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> di&s;|po&s;ed him&s;elf to attack the Red Squadron; Lieu|tenant Admiral <HI>Bankert</HI> the White, and Lieute|nant Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI> the Blue one. <HI>De Ruiter</HI> advanced his Squadron, and came up and po&s;ted him&s;elf within Pi&s;tol &s;hot Right again&s;t the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and fired a broad&s;ide at him, which he returned again with the like. The two Admi|rals continued thundring at one another, with continual di&s;charges for about 2 hours, till they were both much &s;hattered. But at la&s;t, the Duke of <HI>York</HI>'s Flag, with the main Top-Ma&s;t to which it was fa&s;tned, being &s;hot down, he was forced to remove, and put up his Flag in another Ship, called the <HI>London.</HI> Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Van Nes,</HI> &s;econded by &s;ome other Ships, made right up to the Vice-Admiral of the Red; both of them kept with their head to the North in charging: But a Calm coming on, they could make no more mo|tion with any advantage to them&s;elves. Howe|ver they continued firing at one another all the while without intermi&s;&s;ion. The <HI>Royal Catharine</HI> an 80 Gun Ship, Commanded by Captain <HI>Chich|ly,</HI> falling near <HI>Van Nes</HI>'s Ship, he gave order to his men to &s;eize and take her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ut a little time after <HI>Van Nes</HI> had quitted her to return to the fight, the <HI>Dutch</HI> that were put on board to keep
<PB N="449" REF="232"> her, begun to pillage, &s;o that the <HI>English</HI> that were left in her, knew &s;o well to make their ad|vantage of that opportunity, that they retook her again, and carried her back into <HI>England.</HI> Captain <HI>Brakel</HI> did that day, without having receiv'd any or|der for it, one of the Bolde&s;t and mo&s;t Heroick Actions in the World. For at the very begin|ning of the battle, whil&s;t the Wind continued to blow &s;till a &s;oft Gale, coming out of <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Squadron, followed by a Fire &s;hip, he tackt to the Northward, and fell upon the Earl of <HI>Sand|wich,</HI> Admiral of the Blue Squadron: He made up to him without firing &s;o much as one Gun, endu|ring all the furious di&s;charges of his Enemy, and of &s;everal other <HI>English</HI> Ships that were about him. And when he was got very near the <HI>Royal James</HI> he fired a whole broad&s;ide at her &s;o effectually, that a moment after there was nothing to be heard from her but the lamentable cries of a great Number of poor wounded wretches not to &s;peak of tho&s;e that were killed with &s;hot or &s;plinters. But that which &s;ets of the Glory of that Action with &s;o much the more Lu&s;tre, is, that <HI>Brakel</HI>'s Ship, cal|led the <HI>Grand Holland,</HI> carried not above 300 men, and 62 Guns, whereas the <HI>Royal James</HI> car|ried above 104, and 1000 men &s;o that this compa|red to the other appeared but like a &s;mall Boat. Yet <HI>Brakel</HI> attackt her &s;o vigorou&s;ly, and fired &s;o furiou&s;ly for half an hour into the very heart of the Enemies Ship, that according to wheat Ad|miral <HI>Mountague</HI> him&s;elf &s;aid, he would have yiel|ded to <HI>Brakel,</HI> if he had born a Flag. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>de Gent</HI>'s Squadron had begun likewi&s;e to engage, and &s;ome of his Ships advanced like|wi&s;e and fell upon Admiral <HI>Mountague;</HI> he ha|ving already repul&s;ed and &s;unk 3 Fire-Ships, found him&s;elf &s;o overwhelmed by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that he could not hold out any longer. To Di&s;engage him&s;elf he cau&s;ed <HI>Brakel</HI>'s Ship that h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ld him &s;o fa&s;t Grapled, to be chopt off with Axes; and which
<PB N="450" REF="233"> had been before &s;o ill treated, that &s;he was n longer able to keep the Sea. Mo&s;t of his Offi+cers were killed, and he had &s;carce 100 &s;ound men left, able to do Service. But to return to <HI>Moun|tague</HI>'s Ship, a fourth Fire-&s;hip falling upon him, Grapled him &s;o fa&s;t, that his Ship was &s;oon burnt to A&s;hes. The Seamen jumpt Pell-Mell into the Sea. And <HI>Mountague</HI> him&s;elf with two of his Sons being entred into a Boat in hopes to &s;ave them|&s;elves, &s;he was in a trice filled &s;o full of men, and overcharged, that &s;he &s;unk; &s;o that Admiral <HI>Mountague</HI> or the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> that had been &s;o Famous, unfortunately peri&s;ht there with two of his Sons. His body was taken up among o|ther Dead men, and carried to <HI>London,</HI> where it was interred with great Honour and Magnifi|cence.</P>

<P>A few days after the Royal Confederate Fleets appeared before the <HI>Dutch</HI> Coa&s;t with de&s;ign to make a de&s;cent near the <HI>Hague, Harlem,</HI> or the <HI>Texel:</HI> But that enterprize was diverted by a kind of Miracle.

<PB N="455" REF="235"> the great &s;urprize and a&s;toni&s;hment of all that were ver&s;ed in Sea affairs, and that ever frequented that Element. That prodigy was lookt upon as one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible marks of the Protection of God that begun to declare it &s;elf for the States. That Retardation of the Tide was likewi&s;e fol|lowed by a horrible Tempe&s;t, that forced the E|nemies Fleets with terror to quit the <HI>Holland</HI> Coa&s;ts, and to retire homewards with great lo&s;s. For three of their men of War, and &s;ome o|ther Victualling Ships were ca&s;t away or &s;wallowed up by the Waves.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Tran&s;actions, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> kept with the <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet near the <HI>Holland</HI> Coa&s;ts to have an eye up|on the Motions of the Enemies. On the 5th of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI> news came, that 14 Ea&s;t-<HI>India</HI> Ships valued at near 14 Millions of Livers were happily arri|ved at the mouth of the <HI>Eems</HI> before <HI>Delfzil.</HI> The Enemies had flattered them&s;elves with the hopes of taking them, and thought it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to mi&s;s of &s;o rich a prize; which obliged them to po&s;t them&s;elves near the <HI>Dogger-Sand</HI> to be the readier at hand to &s;eize upon them. For they could not imagine, the Government could have time to advi&s;e them of the Rupture, becau&s;e they were put to Sea at the time of the be|ginning of the War, and that if they had re|ceived any information of it, that could not have been till it was too late for them to take any precautionary mea&s;ures to &s;ecure them&s;elves. But yet by an in&s;tinct as 'twere of Providence, they &s;tole from the vigilance of the Royal Fleets, and the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet &s;ailed towards the <HI>Eems</HI> to Con|duct them into the Re&s;pective Harbours of their own Country, where they arrived on the 22d of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>The States Fleet would have kept at Sea &s;ome|thing longer, but becau&s;e the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on was almo&s;t pa&s;t, and that Tempe&s;ts would &s;oon begin to raign, and that be&s;ides there was no more dan|ger

<P>From that time forward things begun a little to change face, and <HI>Holland</HI> was &s;ecured by cut|ting the ditches and &s;luces and overflowing all the Avenues to their Towns; and Provi&s;ion was made likewi&s;e for the pre&s;ervation of the pa&s;|&s;ages of <HI>Gorkum, Schonhoven,</HI> and <HI>Minden;</HI> For <HI>Naerden,</HI> was then in the Power of the <HI>French.</HI> The march of the Auxiliary Troops &s;ent by the Emperour and the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the United Provinces contributed al|&s;o very much to &s;top the Conque&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> by the diver&s;ion they gave. For the mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian King was forced to make great detachments to form an Army under the Command of the fa|mous Mar&s;hal <HI>Turenne,</HI> to &s;end to oppo&s;e them. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> on another &s;ide, advanced towards <HI>Charleroy</HI> with de&s;ign to be&s;iege it, but the great Fro&s;ts and Ill Weather that hapned all on a &s;udden, broke his mea&s;ures, &s;o that after he had taken and plundered <HI>Binch,</HI> that Prince reti|red.

The Count of <HI>Koning&s;mark,</HI> who had the guard of the pa&s;&s;es, not finding him&s;elf &s;trong enough to Re|&s;i&s;t him, de&s;erted <HI>Bodgrave,</HI> and retired to <HI>Ley|den.

The Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> being come near <HI>Gond&s;che Sluis,</HI> where Count <HI>Koning&s;|mark</HI> was po&s;ted with his Troops, found there &s;o much re&s;i&s;tance, that he was forced to turn back again, carrying de&s;olation every where along with him, and mi&s;erably Ravaging all the places through which he pa&s;&s;ed. It would be a difficult task to de&s;cribe all the exce&s;&s;ive cruelties he committed there; it is enough to &s;ay, that he carried them to &s;uch a height, that no future Ages will ever lo&s;e the Memory of his Barbarities.

<P>At the &s;ame time, which was the la&s;t day of the Year, the Troops of <HI>Groningen</HI> returned him his change. For the Fro&s;t that had put by the Seige of <HI>Charleroy</HI> having lockt up the Mari&s;h waters round about the &s;trong place of <HI>Koeverden,</HI> they took advantage of that opportunity and &s;eized that important Fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the principal Events of the Year 1672. and this was the deplorable condition into which the United Provinces were then reduced. But God being plea&s;ed afterwards to e&s;pou&s;e their

<P>At the beginning of the Year 1673. <MILESTONE N="1673"> A dete|&s;table plot was di&s;covered at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> to burn the States men of War.

And for that effect, all the Deputies of the Colleges of Admiralty and the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy, had &s;everal Con|ferences with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> in which it was concluded, that the Fleet &s;hould be con&s;idera|bly Augmented and Rendred more potent than it ever yet had been.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI> re|&s;tored to his Admi|ral&s;hip.</NOTE> In the mean while, the Of|fice of Lieutenant Admiral of the College of the Admiralty of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> being vacant by the death of Mr. <HI>de Gent</HI> who &s;ucceeded <HI>Cornelius Tromp</HI> when he was di&s;mi&s;t from his Employment, His Highne&s;s, in Quality of Stat-holder, and Ad|miral General, having a perfect knowledge of <HI>Tromp</HI>'s rare merit, and incomparable valour and Conduct, as well as of the &s;ingular Zeal and Af|fection he had always &s;hewn to the Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of <HI>Orange,</HI> repre&s;ented to him of what im|portance it was both to him&s;elf and the State in that pre&s;&s;ing Juncture, to forget pa&s;t things, and pre&s;t him to accept again of the Office of Lieu|tenant

<P>The Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of <HI>Tromp</HI> in his former Po&s;t at Sea cau&s;ed an unexpre&s;&s;ible joy to all the Seamen in the Fleet, and in General, to all the common people: Who &s;eemed confident after the Reconciliation of tho&s;e two great Men, that the United Provinces would be able to Triumph o|ver the Naval Forces both of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> &s;o much weight they imagined to be in the Con|duct of that one man to turn the Scale of Victory on their &s;ide.</P>
<P>At that time, the States projected an attempt of very great importance, which was to dam up the mouth of the <HI>Thames,</HI> by &s;inking in it great many Ships extraordinarily loaden, and &s;o to ren|der it unpa&s;&s;able.

In the mean while they laboured and wrought night and day to man out their Fleet that they might have their full Complement early in the &s;pring. And if that project had &s;ucceeded, no doubt but <HI>England</HI> would have felt a long time its effect by the in|terruption of its Commerce which would there|by have been totally ruined, and that without any Battle, or Effu&s;ion of Blood.</P>

But we expect no &s;uch ungratefull News, but rather on the contrary, that by your Prudence and &V;ndaunted Re&s;olution, as well as by that of tho&s;e about you, the Glory our Nation has lately gotten by Sea will be maintained with the Protection of God, by the fre&s;h Zeal and Courage which you &s;hall exert. This being &s;o, they will have rea&s;on to rejoice, and we likewi&s;e with them, that they have been the In&s;truments to bring things to a happy end in &s;o ju&s;t a cau&s;e. We &s;hall take care to recompen&s;e the Merit and Bravery of tho&s;e that &s;hall have given any &s;ignal proofs of it, and &s;hall provide, that Great and Glorious Acti|ons &s;hall not be repaid with ingratitude, but rather with a proportionable Reward.

That is both the true intention of the States, and Mine too, that tho&s;e which &s;hall de&s;erve it, &s;hall be punctually and &s;peedi|ly puni&s;ht according to the utmo&s;t rigor of the Or|ders of the Commi&s;&s;ion, and of the Laws of the Country; &s;o that the Cowards and all tho&s;e who &s;hall not behave them&s;elves like brave Soldiers be|fore the Enemy shall have nothing to fear more, than to enter the Harbours of the State; becau&s;e it will be impo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape the rigour of Ju|ctice, and the indignation of the people which will pur&s;ue them every where.

<P>On the fir&s;t of <HI>June,</HI> Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> invited Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> and all the re&s;t of the
<PB N="464" REF="240"> General Officers of the Fleet with him, to dine on board him. And they made on that occa&s;i|on a thou&s;and prote&s;tations one to the other of a &s;incere and tender friend&s;hip. The other Ge|nerals, and all the Captains drunk healths to their Country, giving a thou&s;and a&s;&s;urances of their zeal and inviolable adherence to its &s;ervice; and they all &s;wore, they were ready to &s;pend the la&s;t drop of their blood for its Intere&s;t. So much good will gave great hopes of an a&s;&s;ured Victory and an occa&s;ion to make proof of it &s;oon pre|&s;ented, &s;ince about 4 a Clock in the afternoon, whil&s;t they were yet at Table, the advanced-guards of the Fleet gave them notice, they had di&s;co|vered the Enemies Fleet.</P>
<P>And a little while after, their &s;couts appeared. But becau&s;e 'twas late, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet tackt a|bout to the North We&s;t, and begun to di&s;po&s;e all things ready to come to an Engagement, the next day. The <HI>English</HI> Fleet had ca&s;t Anchor to the We&s;t-ward of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and prepared likewi&s;e for fight, but a Calm coming on, the two Fleets could not come up with one another. The next day there aro&s;e a &s;urly Wind with &s;ome Rain, which obliged both parties to remain at Anchor in pre&s;ence of one another. On the 4th and 5th the Wind ro&s;e higher &s;till, and became more violent. But at length on the 7th. which was the day of the monthly fa&s;t, and the &s;ame day on which the <HI>Dutch</HI> had attackt the Enemies in <HI>Solbay</HI> the la&s;t year, the two Fleets engaged.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> held a Council of War as &s;oon as it was day, where it was re&s;olved to weigh their Anchors a-peak to be ready for fight. But no &s;ooner were the Officers that had been at the Con|&s;ult, gone off from on board the Admiral, but the two Royal Fleets made a Motion, and having ca&s;t their Squadrons into the form of a Cre&s;cent, made up directly towards the <HI>Dutch.</HI> The Forces of tho&s;e two Potent Fleets were ve|ry
<PB N="465" REF="240"> unequal, according to the <HI>Dutch</HI> reports. For tho&s;e of the Allies were &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of 140 &s;ail, whereof 90 were Capital men of War, whereas the <HI>Dutch</HI> pretend to have had there but 52 Capital &s;hips but ill manned and furni&s;hed, 12 Frigats, 14 Advice Yachts, and 25 Fire-&s;hips, making in all 103 &s;ail. There were &s;everal &s;hips that were not yet come into the Fleet; for of the <HI>Zealand</HI> Squadron there were hardly 4; and of <HI>Frie&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Groningen,</HI> there were none at all; and of tho&s;e of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam</HI> there were the &s;hips of Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers,</HI> of the Commander <HI>de Meuwen,</HI> of Captain <HI>Bra|kel,</HI> and &s;everal others that were not yet come. Nay, they were forced for want of Seamen, to take the men out of 3 <HI>Zealand</HI> Frigats, to man Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Bankert</HI>'s &s;hip. In the mean while, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Fleets, ha|ving the Weather gage, came nearer and nearer to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Prince <HI>Robert</HI> who had the Command in chief of the two Royal Fleets, led the Vanguard, which was the Red Squadron. The Count <HI>d' E&s;tree</HI> had the Conduct of the main Battle, or of the White Squadron; And Sir <HI>Edward Sprag,</HI> Admiral of the Blue, Commanded the Rear. The <HI>English</HI> being ill &s;atisfied at the Conduct of the <HI>French</HI> in the la&s;t Battle, dur&s;t tru&s;t them no more, but fearing they would de&s;ert them a|gain as they did before, thought fit to place them under their own Squadrons; &s;o that Mr. <HI>d' A&s;|&s;edan,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Rear Admiral, was placed under Prince <HI>Robert</HI>'s, Squadron and the Marque&s;s <HI>de Grancy</HI> under that of Admiral <HI>Spragg.</HI> As to the Or|der of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, <HI>Tromp</HI> led the Van, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> the main Battle, and <HI>Bankert</HI> the Rear.</P>
<P>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;eeing the Enemies White Squadron advancing towards him, made a &s;peech to his Officers, and repre&s;ented to them, <Q REND="inline">the nece&s;&s;ity of there duty, and to fight like brave men; that for that effect, they needed but to
<PB N="466" REF="241"> follow his example: That for his own part he was &s;purred on by no other intere&s;t to give proofs of his Zeal to his afflicted Country, but that of the Love and Tenderne&s;s he had for it: That he had no other end in coming to Sea, but to labour to re&s;tore the &s;haking State of its af|fairs, by delivering it from tho&s;e Di&s;a&s;ters and Calamities that were ready to overwhelm it, and which without a &s;peedy and timely a&s;&s;i|&s;tance, threatned it with inevitable ruine. That he had much rather &s;acrifice his Life for it&punc; than to Live to &s;uffer its ancient Liberty to be op|pre&s;&s;ed, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Nation forced to un|dergo the un&s;upportable Yoke of a Foreign and Tyrannick power. We have, pur&s;ued he, a ju&s;t God, and an Equitable Cau&s;e, upon which having an entire tru&s;t and confidence, I doubt not of a good and happy &s;ucce&s;s, if you will but behave your &s;elves like brave men.</Q> E|very one of them at tho&s;e words, promi&s;ed him to do &s;o; and as &s;oon as prayers were done, <HI>Tromp</HI> turned to the Seamen of his &s;hip, and cri|ed to them, <HI>Children, the Enemy is near us, let every one of you now give proofs of his bravery, and &s;atisfy the Engagements that brought us hither on board; And if you do it I'll a&s;&s;ure you, that I will recompen&s;e you, and that all shall go well.</HI> After that di&s;cour&s;e, the Seamen te&s;tified an unexpre&s;&s;ible joy, throwing their Caps up into the Air, and crying out! <HI>Long live Tromp?</HI> with promi&s;e to &s;pend to the la&s;t drop of their blood for the Ser|vice of their Country.</P>
<P>About 2 a Clock in the afternoon, the Battle begun. The White Squadron engaged with that of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp.</HI> It is not to be ex|pre&s;t with what valour and undaunted Courage they fought; and notwith&s;tanding the inequali|ty of their Forces, thanks, under God, to the Cowardice, or rather perfidiousne&s;s of the <HI>French</HI> to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the advantage after having a long time
<PB N="467" REF="241"> wavered, was at la&s;t forced to declare in favour of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and was by them &s;tiled a Victory. Tho' at the &s;ame time it be certain, that if the <HI>French</HI> had managed the War then only by Land, and left the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to their own &s;ole but whole &s;trength to attack the <HI>Dutch</HI> by Sea, they would have been &s;o far from preten|ding to Victory, that they would have inevitably been de&s;troyed; &s;uch di&s;advantage is there &s;ome|times in a confederate Force, tho' &s;eemingly great|er than an Enemies, when the Allies act not in full Concert, Union and Fidelity one with ano|ther. The mo&s;t part of the Circum&s;tances of that Battle, as reported by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> are rela|ted in the Letters written on that Subject to his Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and to the States General, by the two Admirals, <HI>de Ruiter</HI> and <HI>Tromp</HI> which we have here in&s;erted.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI>'s Letter to his High|ne&s;s.</NOTE>MY la&s;t written to your Highne&s;s was dated the 6th. In&s;tant. After noon, the air be|gun to clear up a little, and towards evening we could &s;ee the Enemies again. During the night the ill weather was quite ap|pea&s;ed. On the 7th in the morning it was fair Weather, and the Wind was North-We&s;t. That day the Enemies Fleets begun to move. I fi|red the u&s;ual &s;ignal to call a Council of War, where it was re&s;olved to keep our Anchors a-peak, to be ready to be weighed up at the fir&s;t approach of the Enemies. The Officers that had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Council of War were not yet gone away from on board me, when the Roy|al Fleets advanced towards us in the form of a Cre&s;cent. The White Squadron that was turn|ed towards the North, was the fir&s;t that enga|ged with Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and both of them tackt to the North-Ea&s;t-ward. The Squadrons that were under mine, and Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Bankert</HI>'s Command, could not be &s;o &s;oon attackt by the Enemies. However to pre|vent them from &s;eparating us, we made likewi&s;e to the North-Ea&s;t-ward till about two in the afternoon; and then we thought it time to tack about to the Southward, after we had given the &s;ig|nal for it, and &s;ent notice to Lieutenant Admi|ral <HI>Tromp,</HI> by an Advice-Yacht of that motion; and then I engaged with the Red Squadron, and <HI>Bankert</HI> with the Blue one. I was more for|tunate in breaking in among&s;t the Enemies than <HI>Bankert,</HI> for his main Top-ma&s;t, being &s;hot down he had much ado to advance, however he got a great way in, we broke quite through the E|nemies, and we cut &s;everal of their &s;hips from the main of their Fleet by getting the Weather-gage
<PB N="469" REF="242"> of them. We thought not fit to pur&s;ue them, but rather to make a motion towards the North, in Order to veer back towards Lieute|nant Admiral <HI>Tromp.</HI> We joined him towards evening. When we charged the Enemies they tackt about to the South-ward, and we made the &s;ame motion, and fought till the night part|ed us. After the Battle we went and anchored within two miles of <HI>We&s;t-Kappel.</HI> As for the particular pa&s;&s;ages of the whole time of the fight, it is impo&s;&s;ible for us to give an exact relation of them, becau&s;e we have not yet had time to be informed of them. But however it be, we pre&s;ume, that, God be prai&s;ed, the Victory is on the &s;ide of the States, and of his Highne&s;s. And in order to make it a Compleat one, we will put our &s;elves in readine&s;s to fight with all the vigour imaginable, hoping that God will ble&s;s our arms more and more. The fight was furious on both &s;ides, and on our &s;ide &s;ome did better than others, according as the Wind was more or le&s;s favourable to them, and 'tis like the &s;ame hapned al&s;o among&s;t the Enemies. There were a great many &s;hips endamaged on both &s;ides. We have lo&s;t &s;ome Officers, <HI>viz.</HI> Vice Admiral <HI>Schram,</HI> Rear Admiral <HI>&V;lug,</HI> as likewi&s;e the Captains, <HI>Van Bergen</HI> and <HI>Bakker;</HI> Captain <HI>Na&s;&s;aw,</HI> is dangerou&s;ly wounded. The Fire-&s;hips of both Fleets were able to do but little exe|cution, and yet a great many of them were ei|ther burnt, or &s;unk. We have named Rear-Admiral <HI>de Haan</HI> to the Vice-Admiral&s;hip va|cant by the death of <HI>Schram,</HI> under the Flagg of Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and the Comman|der <HI>Meuwen</HI> to the Rear-Admiral's place, who came to the fleet Yer&s;terday in the time of the fight. He reported to us, that he had taken a Yacht coming from <HI>London,</HI> laden with refre&s;h|ments, and &s;ome Rich &s;uits of Cloaths for the

<P>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> gave likewi&s;e in this Battle, as he had done in all the precedent ones in which he was pre&s;ent, mo&s;t &s;ignal proofs of his un|daunted Courage. The very Number of &s;hips he was forced to change, is enough to &s;erve for his <HI>E|logium</HI> in that behalf; for before the fight was over, he had already changed his &s;hips three or four times, which were all &s;o extreamly &s;hat|tered that they were quite di&s;abled. Rear Admi|ral <HI>de Haan</HI> behaved him&s;elf likewi&s;e very gal|lantly, having been forced to &s;hift his &s;hip three times.</P>
<P><HI>De Ruiter,</HI> and <HI>Tromp</HI> in that rencounter gave one another mo&s;t noble and generous proofs of tenderne&s;s and affection. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance <HI>de Ruiter</HI> gave to <HI>Tromp,</HI> he was delivered from the Eminent Peril under which he was ready to &s;ink; for being engaged in the mid&s;t of two Squa|drons of the Enemies, he endured a mo&s;t Terri|ble encounter without any hopes of ever being able to go through it. <HI>Tromp</HI> being &s;en&s;ible of his danger begun to de&s;pair of e&s;caping it, unle&s;s <HI>de Ruiter</HI> would come &s;peedily to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and he was already in an extream impatience to &s;ee him, and comforted up his di&s;couraged Sea|men with the hopes of &s;eeing them&s;elves &s;oon de|livered by that Great man. And as &s;oon as <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;aw <HI>de Ruiter</HI> appear, his joy was extream, &s;o that he cried out! <HI>Courage, my lads, &s;ee there's the be&s;t of our friends that is advancing and co|ming

De Ruiter</HI> ac|companied with Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Bankert</HI> and his Squadron, broke then through the Ene|mies Squadrons, and delivered him with as much zeal as fidelity, which promi&s;ed hopefully that the Reconciliation of tho&s;e two great men, would for the future continue firm and inviolable.</P>
<P>On the 12 of <HI>June,</HI> the fleet was &s;ufficiently repaired, and in a condition to attack the Ene|mies again; when <HI>de Ruiter</HI> pre&s;ently called a Council of War, in which it was Re&s;olved, that &s;ince there was no further Reinforcement to be expected from the Country, and that on the con|trary, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were to receive one, with the fir&s;t We&s;terly Wind, it was better to prevent them, by attacking them fir&s;t, unle&s;s they receiv|ed Orders to the contrary from the States; That all things &s;hould be got ready for that effect a|gain&s;t the 14th. to endeavour by the protection of God, to cha&s;e them off the Sea. Accor|dingly they Ordered the whole fleet to be di|vided into three Squadrons.

<P>The &s;ame day the re&s;olution was taken to at|tack the Enemies, the Deputies of the States, Mr. <HI>Boet&s;claar</HI> and Mr. <HI>Reigersbergen</HI> came on board Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> and being informed of the

There|fore the Signal was given to the whole Fleet, to &s;et &s;ail, and advance towards the Royal Fleets, who&s;e Forces that before the fir&s;t Fight, con&s;i&s;ted of 140 Sail, were then reduced, as was reported among the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to 118, by the Lo&s;&s;es they had &s;uffered. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet then weighed Anchor between 11 a Clock at Noon; and the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Fleet &s;eeing them approach, got them&s;elves like|wi&s;e under Sail, and made &s;hew as if they would have &s;tood them, and been glad to engage them; but as &s;oon as the <HI>Dutch</HI> begun to come near them, and play their Guns at them, the Enemies tackt away to the North-we&s;t-ward, and &s;tood for the Coa&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> with all the Sail they could. The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet followed them clo&s;e, but could not oblige them to make a &s;tand, till about 4 in the Afternoon.</P>
<P>At that Time Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> who commanded the Van-guard, engaged with the <HI>Blue Squadron,</HI> commanded by Sir <HI>Edward Spragg; de Ruiter,</HI> on his &s;ide attacked the Main Battle, or <HI>Red Squadron,</HI> commanded by Prince <HI>Robert;</HI> and about 5 a Clock the two Chiefs of the Ho&s;tile Fleets were engaged in a very fierce Fight. A little while after, Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Bankert,</HI> who commanded the Rear, fell likewi&s;e upon the <HI>White Squadron,</HI> un|der the Command of the Count <HI>d' E&s;tree.</HI> The Fleets fought a great while, and the Fight was ve|ry ob&s;tinate; but as the Royal Fleets had &s;ignified at the very fir&s;t, that they had no mind to engage, they left off Fighting, and dextrou&s;ly made u&s;e of the Advantage of the Wind, which they had, to retire towards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts. Lieutenant Ad|miral <HI>Tromp</HI> was the fir&s;t and the la&s;t in the Fight, and the Bravery with which he attacked Admiral <HI>Spragg,</HI> who likewi&s;e did Wonders, can never be &s;ufficiently admired.</P>
<PB N="474" REF="245">
<P>Among other remarkable things that happened in that la&s;t Engagement, Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers,</HI> that commanded a part of <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Squadron, being in the Ship called the <HI>Elephant,</HI> a much better Sailer than the <HI>Golden Lion,</HI> in which <HI>Tromp</HI> was, going before him, went away &s;o &s;wiftly that the re&s;t of the Ships of his Squadron could not follow him, by which means he found him&s;elf on a &s;udden en|gaged with <HI>Spragg,</HI> and the Vice-Admiral of the <HI>English Blue Squadron,</HI> without any Ships near him to back him, but only 3 Frigats commanded by <HI>de Jong, Hartwich,</HI> and <HI>de Noirot;</HI> for the other Captains of his Squadron, in&s;tead of following him, as they were obliged to do, veered back again towards Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp; Sweers</HI> &s;eeing him&s;elf &s;o unexpectedly de&s;erted, made all the Re|&s;i&s;tance he could, but after he had born a very fierce Shock, he was &s;o terribly &s;hattered by the Ships of the <HI>Blue Squadron,</HI> that he was at la&s;t forced to quit the Line of Battle, and make off further to Sea, to repair his Damages, which Conduct of his was interpreted by <HI>Tromp</HI> to be a piece of Cow|ardice, tho' the Truth was, 'twas pure Ne|ce&s;&s;ity that obliged <HI>Sweers</HI> to act in that man|ner.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>de Ruiter</HI> had engaged, as we have &s;aid, with Prince <HI>Robert</HI>'s Squadron, and their two Ships having grappled one another fought both very de|&s;perately. <HI>Bankert</HI> likewi&s;e &s;ignalized him&s;elf, and fought with great Valour again&s;t the <HI>White Squa|dron,</HI> which was very &s;everely handled by him.

In the mean while, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet finding they had the Advantage, pa&s;t that Night in the Place where the Battle was fought, with a Re&s;olution to advance the next Day and pre|&s;ent a third Battle, to the two Royal Fleets, in

But the Cau&s;e of it was imputed to the treacherous Conduct of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Animo&s;ities of Prince <HI>Robert</HI> again&s;t them on that account, and the Hatred he and mo&s;t of the <HI>English</HI> then in general bore to that leaguing with a Popi&s;h and Dangerous Power again&s;t a Prote&s;tant State, and other Jealou|&s;ies then reigning, concerning the pernicious in|trigues then carrying on between the already per|verted Duke of <HI>York</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Religion and Con&s;titution, which made the Officers and Seamen, very cold in pro&s;ecuting the then Quarrel again&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> in compari&s;on of what they had been in the former Wars.

<P>YE&s;terday at 11 a Clock,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI>'s Letter to the States.</NOTE> having weighed An|chor with an Ea&s;t-Wind, the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet made a Motion in order to approach the Enemies, who unmoored at the &s;ame time, and made away with full &s;ail from us, to avoid a Fight.

<P>This &s;econd Battle co&s;t the Enemies, according to their own Report, about 3000 Men that were killed or wounded. Two Days after that great Action, the Deputies of the States coming on Board, a Council of War was called, in order to take new Re&s;olutions about what it were be&s;t to under|take, that might be u&s;eful and advantageous to the State: Where the Conduct of Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> in the la&s;t Battle was brought in Que&s;tion, which cau&s;ed great Di&s;putes between <HI>Tromp</HI> and <HI>Sweers,</HI> and they were pu&s;ht on with &s;o great a Tran&s;port of Heat and Animo&s;ity by <HI>Tromp,</HI> that it was to be feared, they would have been attended with very ill Con&s;equences.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tromp</HI> ac|cu&s;es Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> of not doing his Duty.</NOTE>Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> upbraided <HI>Sweers</HI> to his Face, That he had not done his Duty, through a &s;hameful Cowardice, which had made him turn his Back before the Enemies. And he alledged, That the &s;aid Vice-Admiral going foremo&s;t, with a part of his Squadron, had not attackt the Enemy as he ought; and further, that he had not maintained the Attack neither, when he was engaged any bet|ter than he had begun, becau&s;e he kept &s;till &s;o to the Windward, that the Captains that were under him were forced to quit him, and to veer back and
<PB N="477" REF="246"> joyn him the &s;aid <HI>Tromp,</HI> as all tho&s;e Captains could faithfully te&s;tifie.</P>
<P>To that, Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> an&s;wered in his Ju&s;tification, That the Damages his Ship had &s;uffer|ed, as well as the great number of Men he had killed and wounded on Board him, &s;ufficed to clear him from the Inju&s;tice and cruel Outrage done to his Reputation, &s;ince by that it might ea&s;ily be &s;een he was hotly engaged with the Enemies at the Be|ginning of the Fight; but that at la&s;t his Main-topmo&s;t being &s;hot down, he was forced, much again&s;t his Will, to retire, in order to repair his Damages; That in &s;uch an occa&s;ion it was impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to change his Ship, becau&s;e that of Captain <HI>Jong</HI> was as much di&s;abled as his own, and that be&s;ides the Frigats that &s;econded him were too &s;mall to put his Flag up in; And that he made Oath before God, that he was not guilty of the Crime imputed to him, but that he had performed as well as any Man in the Fleet.</P>
<P>And the Quarrel between the&s;e two Generals grew &s;o hot, that they would have proceeded from Words to Blows, had it not been for the Re&s;pect they were obliged to have for the Deputies of the States, who were there pre&s;ent, and who, to pre|vent the mi&s;chievous Con&s;equences that might follow from tho&s;e Differences, ordered <HI>Cornelius Evert&s;z, Van Nes,</HI> and <HI>John Dik,</HI> accompanied with <HI>Van Wouw,</HI> the Fi&s;cal of the Fleet, to go on Board Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> Ship, to examine the Damages he had &s;uffered, and to report them to the Council of War. Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> fortified his Accu&s;ation with 14 Depo&s;itions which were receiv'd, and which all amounted only to this, <HI>viz. That they had &s;een Vice-Admiral</HI> Sweers <HI>to the Windward, a great way off from the re&s;t, and knew not the Rea&s;on of it.</HI></P>
<P>Vice-Admiral <HI>Sweers</HI> replied to all that, in the fir&s;t Place, by a Li&s;t of the Lo&s;&s;es and Damages his Ship had &s;uffered, authorized by the Atte&s;tation of
<PB N="478" REF="247"> the Commi&s;&s;ioners appointed to examine them, who loudly declared, <HI>That if the Ship had been their own, they mu&s;t have been con&s;trained to act in the &s;ame manner as</HI> Sweers <HI>had done.</HI> In the &s;econd place he produced a li&s;t of his killed and woun|ded men, which were to the Number of 32 of the latter, and 11 of the former, which was at|te&s;ted by the Chirurgeons of his &s;hip. The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> taking that affair to heart, &s;ent word to the Council of War, that he de&s;ired them, to put it off till &s;ome further time, that he might him|&s;elf be fully informed of the whole truth of it. <HI>Tromp</HI> and <HI>Sweers</HI> profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves well &s;a|tisfied with it, and promi&s;ed to conform to his Highne&s;&s;es orders, and that was the end of the di&s;|pute between tho&s;e two Generals.</P>
<P>On the 19th of the month upon advice, that the Royal fleets were retired into the <HI>Thames</HI> Rear Admiral <HI>de Haan</HI> was detacht away with a Squadron of 12 men of War, 2 fire-&s;hips, and 4 Advice Yachts, with order to ob&s;erve them. And he reported at his return, that he had heard from a pilot of <HI>Lubeck</HI> that came from <HI>London</HI> on the 16th, that the two Ho&s;tile fleets were riding near <HI>Sheerne&s;s</HI> to the Number of about 70 men of War, and that they were to go up the Ri|ver as far as <HI>Tilbury Hope,</HI> to take on board 30000 men of Regular Troops in order to at|tempt a de&s;cent upon the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Zealand,</HI> and that there were already 20 &s;hips ready.</P>
<P>On the 27th. the two fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> put to Sea again, being 150 &s;ail &s;trong, <HI>viz.</HI> 80 <HI>English</HI> and 28 <HI>French</HI> men of War. The <HI>Dutch</HI> fleet on the other &s;ide, were but 100 &s;ail in all, in|cluding the Reinforcements they had lately received; but however, in that dangerous Juncture, they re|&s;olved notwith&s;tanding the inequality of their Forces to go and meet the Enemies, and give them Battle. And on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> 1&s;t. of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they met them, but the Enemi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s who intended nothing

The <HI>Hol|landers</HI> ob&s;erving the Enemies behaviour, pre&s;u|med it to be a Stratagem they played to make &s;hew as if they fled, only to draw the <HI>Dutch</HI> a|way from the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Zealand,</HI> that they might have opportunity afterwards to execute their great de&s;ign, which was a de&s;cent. And in effect, they were not deceived; for the next day towards evening, the Royal Fleets appeared before the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> and a day after, before <HI>Scheveling.</HI></P>
<P>At that motion of theirs, all <HI>Holland</HI> was in an alarm for fear the Enemies &s;hould enter into the heart of the Country to wa&s;te and de&s;troy it, and therefore in order to oppo&s;e them, all the Companies of the Burghers of the <HI>Hague,</HI> and of <HI>Delft</HI> and all the pea&s;ants of the villages round about were Commanded to march with all ha&s;te towards the Coa&s;ts. Cannon was likewi&s;e &s;ent down thither to furni&s;h &s;ufficient batteries of de|fence. About 11 a Clock before noon, 6 or 7 light Frigats approacht &s;o near the Coa&s;ts by fa|vour of the Tide, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> on &s;hore be|gun to play their Cannon at them, which the <HI>English</HI> an&s;wered with the like, but without doing much mi&s;chief. After that the Enemies made off a|gain into the main Sea, and &s;hew'd them&s;elves the &s;ame day in the afternoon, near <HI>Zandvoort</HI> and <HI>de Wikopzee,</HI> about three miles from the &s;hore, and &s;ending up 2 Frigats near to this la&s;t place, they bat|tered it for &s;ome time with their Guns. The next day they appeared likewi&s;e before <HI>Egmond</HI> and <HI>Petten,</HI> and la&s;tly before <HI>Helder,</HI> and the <HI>Texel.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> hearing at the Army which was encampt at <HI>Ram&s;donk</HI> that the Enemies Fleets hovered about the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Holland,</HI> came with

<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> after he had been at &s;e|veral conferences held concerning the affairs of the Land Army, went down to the Fleet to give likewi&s;e his orders there; and he no &s;ooner en|tred on board Admiral <HI>de Ruiter,</HI> but they &s;a|luted him with 13 Guns in acknowledgment of the honour of his pre&s;ence, after which he a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the Council of War, where it was re&s;olved Battle &s;hould be given the Enemies as &s;oon as it was po&s;&s;ible, in hopes thereby to force them at lea&s;t to quit the Coa&s;ts and Harbours of the U|nited Provinces.

<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet without any further delay, weighed Anchor the very next day, and &s;teered away directly towards the <HI>Texel,</HI> where the Roy|al Fleets were; but by rea&s;on of contrary winds they could not get up with the Enemies Fleet till the 20th.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A third fi ht.</NOTE> The next day in the morning, the fight begun, which proved one of the mo&s;t furious and bloody ones that ever was recorded in Hi|&s;tory, and that ever was fought upon the Ocean.

<P>Therefore on the 7th of <HI>October</HI> they quitted <HI>Woorden,</HI> on the 14th of <HI>November Bommel,</HI> and on the 23d of the &s;ame Month <HI>&V;trecht,</HI> and in ge|neral all the Conque&s;ts they had made in the Pro|vinces of <HI>&V;trecht, Guelders</HI> and <HI>Over-Y&s;&s;el:</HI> But before their Retreat, they extorted immen&s;e Sums from the Inhabitants, and committed all the De|predations Cruelty and De&s;pair could incite them

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dutch</HI> attack <HI>Belle-I&s;le.</HI></NOTE>On the 26th Lieutenant Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and the Count <HI>de Horn,</HI> took a Boat, and went and viewed in what Places it would be mo&s;t proper to make a De&s;cent; and when they came back to the Fleet, they ordered the Land-Troops to be in Readine&s;s for the next Day, with a De&s;ign to make then an Attempt, in ca&s;e the Wind proved favourable: And accordingly, on the 27th, at Break of Day, the Signal was given for it, upon which all the Gal|liots, being filled with Soldiers, approached the Shore, in order to make a De&s;cent, by Favour of the Fire made by the Guns of their Men of War. The <HI>Dutch,</HI> being landed, found much le&s;s Re&s;i|&s;tance than they expected, tho' the <HI>French</HI> had made double Retrenchments, and po&s;ted in them nume|rous Guards; and that be&s;ides there was a Hill in the way very &s;teep and difficult of A&s;cent. As &s;oon as the Troops were landed, they drew up in order of Battle, and advanced towards the Ca&s;tle, and when they came within Musket-&s;hot of it, becau&s;e it was now Evening, they made a Halt.

On the 29th a Bark belong|ing to the Ca&s;tle came out to the Fleet with a White Flag, and brought a Letter from <HI>de Lorgerie,</HI> to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Generals, to let them know that he wanted Refre&s;hments, and that if they would give him leave for two or three Fi&s;hing Ve&s;&s;els they &s;hould catch Fi&s;h for him and them too; but Ad|miral <HI>Tromp</HI> would by no means grant his Re|que&s;t.</P>

The <HI>Dutch,</HI> after having &s;taid two Days upon the I&s;land, re&s;olved at length to re|imbark again, without attempting any thing more upon the Ca&s;tle, becau&s;e they thought it would co&s;t too much Time formally to be&s;iege it. They carried off with them only three Pieces of Cannon from the I&s;land to the Fleet.</P>
<P>On the 2d of <HI>July</HI> they unmoored, and on the 3d came to an Anchor in the Bay of <HI>Bourgneuf,</HI> right again&s;t <HI>Narmourtiers,</HI> and employed the re&s;t of the Day in making the nece&s;&s;ary Preparations
<PB N="496" REF="256"> in order to a De&s;cent the next Morning. In the mean while, Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> took Boat and went and viewed where it might be mo&s;t proper to at|tempt it. The Enemies had made &s;everal Retrench|ments upon the Shore, and had placed there their Mu&s;queteers. On the 4th the Signal was given for Landing, and thereupon all the Troops getting into Boats for that purpo&s;e, approached the Shore, to which they were forced to climb up over Rocks, or wade through the Water as high as their middles.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> at the fir&s;t Approach of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> fired &s;omething briskly upon them, but as &s;oon as they &s;aw them advance, and march towards them with an undaunted Re&s;olution, they de&s;erted their Retrenchments, and retired a great way up into the Country.

<P>Upon tho&s;e Advices, the Count <HI>de Horn</HI> ha&s;tned the March of his Troops, with a Re&s;olution to oppo&s;e their Pa&s;&s;age, leaving Captain <HI>Brakel</HI> with 3 Companies of Seamen and 60 Mu&s;queteers in the Ca&s;tle, and Captain <HI>Hardenbrock,</HI> with Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI>'s Company of Seamen in the Abbey, to guard tho&s;e Po&s;ts.

<P>That I&s;land contains about 1000 Hou&s;es, and is not above 250 Paces di&s;tant from the main Land, &s;o that the <HI>French</HI> on the one &s;ide, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on the other could mutually cannonade one another. For when the Tide is low, the &s;pace between <HI>Bouin</HI> and <HI>Beauvoir,</HI> which is in the main Land of <HI>Poitou,</HI> is &s;o very dry, that as many Men as plea&s;e may pa&s;s in a Rank from either of the Places to the other, which may be done two Hours after the going out of the Tide.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> to intimidate the <HI>Dutch,</HI> gave out a Report, That their King had &s;ent Orders to all the Hor&s;e and Foot that were on the other Side, to pa&s;s over to oppo&s;e their Depredations, and force them to quit that Po&s;t; but for all their Bravado's their Countenance well &s;hewed, they were more apprehen&s;ive of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> than the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> were of all their fal&s;e Alarms, &s;ince they re|moved all the Straw and Boiling Ve&s;&s;els that be|longed to their Salt-pits, to <HI>Bouin</HI> and <HI>Beauvoir,</HI> for Security. In the mean while Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> commanded all his Ships to return again to their Flag; on the 7th he approached the Shore with his whole Fleet, and recommended to his General Offi|cers &s;trictly to forbid their Seamen, under Pain of Death not to amu&s;e them&s;elves with plundring a&s;hore either Cattle, or any thing el&s;e.</P>

<PB N="509" REF="262"> the Enemies Fleet being about 50 &s;ail &s;trong, great and &s;mall, according to the report of our advanced guards. And becau&s;e in the after|noon the wind grew higher, and the Enemies had the advantage of it, they made u&s;e of it to &s;lide away from us, &s;o that we had much ado to follow them. The night following, we pur&s;ued them with full &s;ail, but then changing their Cour&s;e they &s;tole out of our &s;ight by favour of the darkne&s;s; which obliged us to &s;end a de|tachment of 7 light Frigats to go and hunt them out, and get &s;ome new di&s;coveries of them. A|bout noon, we de&s;cried them to the South-Ea&s;t-ward of our Fleet, upon which we pre&s;ently gave the &s;ignal to all the Fleet to make all the &s;ail they could to get up with them, and we followed them till the dusk of night.

About noon the wind was We&s;t-North-We&s;t, and we had the Weather-gage; and then the two Fleets engaged: And no &s;ooner was the fight begun, but the Ship called the <HI>Three Crowns</HI> carrying 134 Guns, and Commanded by the <HI>Swedish</HI> Admiral, was over&s;et, and blown up into the air in a little time after, by I know not what accident, &s;ince I had given her but very few broad&s;ides. At that, all the whole Enemies Fleet made as if they would fly. I pre&s;ent|ly gave the &s;ignal for attacking them on all &s;ides, and falling upon them with our whole Fleet, which motion made them &s;top &s;hort, we then tackt to the South-ward, and I drew near them, and flankt the Enemies Admi|ral's Ship that was the chief of a Squadron, car|rying 96 Guns.

That hapned about 6 in the af|ternoon. The Enemies Fleet, after the fatal lo&s;s of two Admirals, &s;eeing that Fortune fa|voured us, and that the wavering Victory was ready to declare it &s;elf for the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet, thought it time to make away into the Main Sea, &s;o that all the Ships which compo&s;ed it, confu&s;edly betook them&s;elves to flight, and &s;tole away by the help of their &s;ails from the pur&s;uit of the Victours. They left behind them the <HI>Neptune,</HI> of 44 Guns, and 198 men, which was taken by Captain <HI>Van Zyl.</HI> There was like|wi&s;e another taken as con&s;iderable as that.

It will be impertinent to relate here what cau&s;ed the de&s;truction of the fir&s;t Admiral's Ship that pa&s;|&s;ed for one of the fine&s;t that ever appeared yet in the Northern Seas. It carried 134 Bra&s;s Guns, and 1100 men. At the approach of the Allies Fleet, Admiral <HI>Kruits</HI> who was in her, Com|manded the Guns to be placed on one &s;ide in their Carriages that he might be ready to fire a whole broad&s;ide; after which the gunners were ordered to pa&s;s to the other &s;ide, which they did; but they having forgot to make the Guns fa&s;t, the Ship turned on her other &s;ide, which made
<PB N="512" REF="264"> all the Guns flie out of their Port-holes, and fall on the other &s;ide, and &s;o over&s;et the Ship. And that di&s;a&s;ter was &s;oon followed with a greater, which was that the lighted matches fell into the Powder-Room, which &s;ome moments after blew up the Ship.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedish</HI> Fleet having been cha&s;ed almo&s;t as far as <HI>Stockholm</HI> by the <HI>Danes,</HI> Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;ailed to the <HI>Sound</HI> with his Squadron, and came to an Anchour at <HI>Kongerbotcht.</HI> Great rejoycings were made at <HI>Copenhagen</HI> for the Victory lately obtained over the <HI>Swedes;</HI> after which the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> was re&s;olved to pu&s;h his Conque&s;ts &s;till further. And for that effect &s;ent Orders to Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> to come with the Confederate Fleet to <HI>Vistad,</HI> to endeavour, if it were po&s;&s;i|ble, to make a de&s;cent on that &s;ide, in <HI>Schonen,</HI> whil&s;t he on the other, &s;hould enter it with his Land-Army.

<P>After that an&s;wer, <HI>Tromp</HI> &s;ent a detachment of 4 Frigats, and 3 Galliots, to advance near the Town, and to Cannonade it; but by rea&s;on of a Calm coming on, it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to execute any thing that day, but he was forced to &s;tay till the next day, when the Frigats approaching within Musket &s;hot of the Ramparts begun to play, at them with their Guns. In the afternoon <HI>Tromp</HI> reinforced them with 4 frigats more, and they fired &s;o furiou&s;ly with all their Guns at the Ramparts, that no body dur&s;t appear any more upon them. After which a body of 3000 Seamen and Soldiers were Commanded to make a de&s;cent
<PB N="513" REF="264"> on both &s;ides of the Town. The Burghers did all they could, to oppo&s;e them with a body of 700 Hor&s;e, and 150 Foot.

<P>About 6 at night, the Admiral ordered the Troops to be in readine&s;s to attack the Town on both &s;ides as &s;oon as ever he &s;hould give the &s;ignal for it, but fir&s;t he thought fit to Summon the Go|vernour once more to &s;urrender it; and the in|habitants begun to &s;hew them&s;elves, and reported, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> had quitted it, but that they had min'd it before their Retreat. The <HI>Danes</HI> thereupon pre&s;ently &s;eized it, cleared it of the Mines, and refortified it with a Re&s;olution to maintain it, and defend it &s;toutly in ca&s;e the <HI>Swedes</HI> &s;hould return with an Army to attack them, and for that end, they drew out of the Fleet &s;uch a proportion of Guns and Ammunition as was thought nece&s;&s;ary, and carried into the Town.</P>

The Fort of <HI>Borch|holm</HI> of which depended the pre&s;ervation of the I&s;le of <HI>Enland,</HI> had in it a &s;trong Garri&s;on of 1200 men, and therefore the <HI>Danes</HI> thought not fit to attack it, but contented them&s;elves with pillaging and &s;poiling the flat Country, from whence they carried off near 2000 head of great and &s;mall Cattle, which were &s;ent to the Fleet.</P>
<P>And &s;ince fortune &s;miled &s;o upon the <HI>Danes,</HI> and their Arms were every where Triumphant, the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> would not be content with the depredations his Troops committed in the E|nemies Country, but would needs form a further and more important Enterprize upon the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen:</HI> For which effect, he &s;ent for &s;ome thou|&s;ands of men of his Troops from <HI>Schonen,</HI> and &s;ent orders to Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> and Lieutenant Admiral <HI>William Ba&s;tiaan&s;z,</HI> to come to
<PB N="525" REF="270"> <HI>Copenhagen</HI> with their Squadron; Admiral <HI>Mark Rot&s;tein</HI> received the &s;ame order, and to bring with him a detachment of the bigge&s;t Ships of the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet. On the 5th of <HI>September</HI> they parted from Admiral <HI>Juel,</HI> who &s;eeing there was nothing more to do at <HI>Kalmar,</HI> nor in the I&s;le of <HI>Enland,</HI> weighed Anchor the next day, and pa&s;&s;ing by the Country of <HI>Smaland,</HI> he ravaged the I&s;les of <HI>&V;kno,</HI> and <HI>Runo,</HI> where he put &s;everal of the inhabitants to the &s;word that attempted to make re&s;i&s;tance. After that expedition, he went and attackt 24 of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>'s Magazines near <HI>We&s;terwyk.</HI> Captain <HI>Bovenfield</HI> with a party of 150 Seamen, was commanded to go and burn them, who at the &s;ame time &s;et fire to two Lord&s;hips and three Villages that were higher up the Country, in &s;pite of the oppo&s;iti|on the <HI>Swedes</HI> made with a body of Pea&s;ants that were got together.</P>
<P>After that, a Re&s;olution was taken to attack <HI>We&s;terwyk,</HI> and burn it, for which execution choice was made of &s;ome of the lighte&s;t Fri|gats in the Fleet, with which were &s;ent a detach|ment of 500 Soldiers, and as many Seamen under the Command of General <HI>Mullet</HI> and of Rear-Admiral <HI>Flori&s;z Kar&s;ten&s;z.</HI> On the 10th. of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> they pre&s;ented them&s;elves at the mouth of the Haven of <HI>We&s;terwyk,</HI> where they lodged two Frigats which fired hotly at the Ba&s;tion of <HI>Sparo&s;und,</HI> whil&s;t on the other &s;ide, the Generals advanced with their Boats into the Port to view in what place they might be&s;t make a de&s;cent; and after they had pa&s;t by &s;everal I&s;lets, they attackt two Retrenchments, which they took. On the 11th. at break of day, they forced open the Barrier or Boom of the Haven, and &s;ent in their Fire-Ships and their other &s;mall Ships.</P>
<P>About 7 a Clock the <HI>Danes</HI> pre&s;ented them|&s;elves before the Town, which appeared to them in the form of a Half-Moon, being adorned with
<PB N="526" REF="271"> many fair Hou&s;es and Stately Turrets. From the Sea-ward Captain <HI>Dreyer</HI> fired upon it with his Guns, which the <HI>Swedes</HI> an&s;wered from a bat|tery of 12 pieces of Cannon they had erected on the &s;hore. When night came on the <HI>Swedes</HI> threw their Cannon into the water, and Quitted that Po&s;t, and afterwards the Town; upon which the <HI>Danes</HI> next morning &s;eized both the Town and Fort. That place belonged to Count <HI>Ko|ning&s;mark.</HI> The <HI>Danes</HI> reduced it all to a&s;hes, not &s;paring &s;o much as the &s;hips that were in the Harbour. After that great Expedition, the Fleet weigh'd Anchor, and &s;ailed for <HI>Gothland</HI> after they had put all the Country every where in a|larm, and carried terrour even as far as <HI>Stockholm</HI> the Capital City of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> as we have &s;aid, had received order, to go to <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> where he arrived on the 10 of <HI>September,</HI> together with both the <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadron, and the <HI>Danish</HI> one that was detacht from the main Fleet.</P>
<P>All things being ready then for a great Expe|dition the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> had re&s;olved upon, his Maje&s;ty put him&s;elf at the head of the Fleet followed by <HI>Tromp,</HI> by the other General Officers of the Fleet, and by 4000 men, being Regular Troops which were embarkt with them. On the 13th. of the month, they weighed Anchor, and on the 16th they came in &s;ight of the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen,</HI> and the next day the great &s;hips Anchored at the point of <HI>Wittaw,</HI> whil&s;t the Galliots and other &s;maller Ve&s;|&s;els were &s;ent towards the &s;hore, between the <HI>Penin&s;ule,</HI> or half I&s;land <HI>Wittaw,</HI> and <HI>Ja&s;mund,</HI> where they Landed their Troops with &s;uch Ex|pedition that about 4 in the afternoon the be&s;t part of both their Hor&s;e and Foot were already on &s;hore. The Commander <HI>Keller</HI> at the head of 30 men, and a Major at the head of 15 <HI>Germans</HI> advanced the foremo&s;t of all; at their approach a body of the Enemies Cavalry of 100 men fell
<PB N="527" REF="271"> upon them and charged them, but after two di&s;|charges they were fain to flie, not being able a|ny longer to &s;tand again&s;t the fierce firing that was made at them from the &s;hips. The <HI>Danes</HI> lo&s;t not one man in that Rencounter and pre|&s;ently di&s;charged their Cannon and &s;mall Arms for Joy they had had the happine&s;s to Land with|out any ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening, 50 <HI>Danish</HI> Hor&s;e were de|tacht away towards <HI>Wittaw</HI> and <HI>Ja&s;mund;</HI> but they found no body there but &s;ome Pea&s;ants, and two Hor&s;emen whom they brought Pri&s;oners to the Army. On the 18th the King him&s;elf and Prince <HI>George</HI> him&s;elf came likewi&s;e to Land, and &s;eve|ral Gentlemen of the Country, yielded them&s;elves and demanded Protections. Four days after his Maje&s;ty departed in order to return to <HI>Copen|hagen</HI> leaving the Command of his Army in chief to Mar&s;hal <HI>Golt&s;z.</HI> Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> departed likewi&s;e with the <HI>Danish</HI> Envoy Mr. <HI>Buckwald,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Brand</HI> the Re&s;ident of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> to go to the Electour of <HI>Brandenburg,</HI> who was then em|ployed in the Siege of <HI>Stetin.</HI> They arrived there on the 22d. Upon who&s;e application the Gene|rous Electour pre&s;ently detacht away a Bo|dy of Hor&s;e with orders to go to the Fort <HI>Pennemunder,</HI> to be ready at a Call to back the <HI>Danes</HI> in their enterprize upon the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen.</HI> And by that means, the <HI>Danes</HI> were &s;o well Re|inforced that Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> that Comman|ded the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Troops in that I&s;le, found him|&s;elf not in any condition to oppo&s;e their de|predations, and much le&s;s to give them Battle. However to do what he could, he Commanded the Gentlemen of the Country and all the In|habitants to come in and joyn him, but Mar&s;hal <HI>Goltz</HI> having publi&s;ht contrary orders, there were very few that ventured to pay obedience to Count <HI>Koning&s;mark.</HI></P>
<PB N="528" REF="272">
<P>Neither were the <HI>Danish</HI> Troops Reinforced only by the <HI>Brandenburgers,</HI> but the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> him&s;elf came and joyned them with a good Body of Hor&s;e, &s;o that the Army then was 8000 &s;trong. Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> therefore finding his forces much inferiour to tho&s;e of the <HI>Danes,</HI> thought it better to Quit the field, than &s;tay to be beaten out of it; and therefore retired to <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> carrying off with him all he po&s;&s;ibly could. Thus the <HI>Danes</HI> became Ma&s;ters of the whole I&s;le, excepting only the Old and New Fort, the fir&s;t of which they took &s;oon after, but the latter of them having received a Reinforcement of fre&s;h Troops from <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> &s;toutly with|&s;tood all their attacks, and were the cau&s;e after|wards that they were forced to Quit all the Conque&s;ts they had made there. All tho&s;e hap|py &s;ucce&s;&s;es the <HI>Danes</HI> had in the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen,</HI> were followed by the taking of the Town of <HI>Stetin,</HI> which after a long and bloody Siege yiel|ded at la&s;t to the Electour of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> on the 26th. of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="1678"> Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> being de&s;perately enraged at the Progre&s;&s;es of the <HI>Danes</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Ru|gen,</HI> was extreamly impatient to find an oppor|tunity to deliver it from their depredations, and to re&s;tore it to its rightfull Prince; And for that effect, having with wonderfull celerity embarked his Infantry, he went and Landed with his Ca|valry at the New Fort, which the more ea&s;ily de|ceived the <HI>Danes,</HI> becau&s;e they thought nothing more impracticable or le&s;s to be feared than &s;o &s;peedy a return of the <HI>Swedes.</HI> At his arrival he a&s;&s;emb|led all the Troops he had with him to the Num|ber of 5000 fighting men, and on the 18th. of the month, went and encamped in the open field with a Re&s;olution to give Battle to the <HI>Danes.</HI> Major General <HI>Rumor</HI> who &s;ucceeded in the place of Mar&s;hal <HI>Goltz</HI> who was recalled by Vertue

That &s;ignal Victory revived the drooping Cou|rage of the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and Re-e&s;tabli&s;hed their af|fairs upon &s;o good a Foot, that the lo&s;&s;es and da|mages either of the Parties had &s;uffered by the other that Campaign, were thereby in &s;ome Fort counterballanced.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> &s;eeing there was no hopes of drawing any &s;uccours for that years Campaign from the United Provinces, gave Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> per|mi&s;&s;ion to return home, and conferred the chief Command of his Fleet upon Admiral <HI>Niels Juel,</HI> making him Admiral General. Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> therefore prepared to be gone; and then the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> taking a Re&s;olution to carry his Arms once more into the I&s;le of <HI>Ru|gen,</HI> and to make a Conque&s;t of it, whatever it co&s;t him, and thinking Admiral <HI>Tromp</HI> might be of great u&s;e to him in that de&s;ign, de&s;ired him to be plea&s;ed to accompany him in that expedi|tion. He therefore took leave of his Maje&s;ty, after having received a very rich pre&s;ent from him, and all imaginable marks of Friend&s;hip and Gratitude, and went to <HI>VVolga&s;t,</HI> where the E|lector of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> mo&s;t kindly and nobly re|ceived him.</P>
<PB N="528" REF="273">
<P>The Enterprize of Re-entring into the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen</HI> being then projected, the <HI>Danish</HI> Fleet, un|der the Command of Admiral <HI>Juel,</HI> had order to advance. On the 22d of <HI>September,</HI> Major Gene|ral <HI>Lewenhelm,</HI> who Commanded the <HI>Danish</HI> Land-Forces, took po&s;t at <HI>Wittaw.</HI> The <HI>Swedes,</HI> to the Number of 1000 men, offering to oppo&s;e their de|cent, were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s. His Electoral High|ne&s;s having embarkt his Troops at <HI>Pennermund,</HI> came him&s;elf on board, Commanded to weigh Anchor on the 22d, and made toward the I&s;le of <HI>Rugen</HI> with a Fleet of 210 Ships, and 140 Barks, or &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els proper for Landing the Troops in; and thus the Fleet advanced, being ranged in very good order of Battle.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal <HI>Dorfling</HI> Commanded the Troops un|der the Elector; <HI>Tromp,</HI> who engaged in that expedition as a Volunteer, had the Command of the Fleet, and went in the Ship called the <HI>E|lectoral Prince.</HI> In the afternoon a Calm coming on, they were forced to ca&s;t Anchor very near the I&s;le. In the mean while the <HI>Swedes</HI> kept fi|ring at the Fleet from a Battery of 10 great Guns and yet in all that time killed but 2 Per&s;ons, which is very remarkable. On the 23d at break of day, Admiral <HI>Juel</HI> having left his own Fleet, came on board the Elector, to inform him, that the <HI>Danes</HI> had taken po&s;t the day before near <HI>Wittaw.</HI></P>
<P>Upon that advice, the Elector gave order to his people, to weigh Anchor, that he might not give time to Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> to attack the <HI>Danes</HI> before their Junctions, with his Troops. About noon the Calm begun again, &s;o that to make the more ha&s;te, they were forced to tow the men of War forward with boats: when they drew near the &s;hore, the Troops made u&s;e of Pikes and Shovels in&s;tead of Oars, to get to Land with the more ha&s;te; Nay &s;ome of them jumpt into the Sea, up to the neck in water, and waded to
<PB N="529" REF="273"> &s;hore, becau&s;e they would be there the foremo&s;t and the fir&s;t, to give proofs of their Bravery. At the approach of the <HI>Danes,</HI> the <HI>Swedish</HI> Hor&s;e &s;hewed them&s;elves on the high grounds, and Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> cau&s;ed &s;ome pieces of Cannon to be advanced, re&s;olved to fire briskly from them upon the <HI>Brandenburgers</HI> before they &s;hould re|cover the di&s;order their Landing would nece&s;&s;ari|ly put them in: But &s;eeing them &s;o nimbly get into Battle array, and that they had already got Cannon with them a&s;hore, he ordered his men to quit the Po&s;t where they were placed; &s;o that the Electors whole Army con&s;i&s;ting of 4000 men, made a de&s;cent without any oppo&s;ition from the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and without having above two men killed and one wounded.</P>
<P>Mar&s;hal <HI>Dorfling,</HI> as &s;oon as he was Landed, took with him all the Hor&s;e that were yet di&s;|embarkt, and fell to pur&s;uing the <HI>Swedes,</HI> and 200 Hor&s;e of them having charged 8 Batalions of the Enemies, their con&s;ternation was &s;o ex|tream, that they turned tail &s;oon after. There were taken that day about 200 Pri&s;oners. Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> &s;eeing his affairs going down the Wind, was minded to u&s;e Circum&s;pection, and thought it high time to rally together the Re|licks of his di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;pirited Forces, and accordingly he a&s;&s;embled them together in one bo|dy, and advanced with them towards the old Fort, with de&s;ign to pa&s;s from thence to <HI>Strael&s;und,</HI> in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. But in the mean while General <HI>Dorfling,</HI> who followed him clo&s;e at the heels, marcht with that diligence, that the next day he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">epre&s;ented him&s;elf before that place. The <HI>Swedes</HI> were extreamly &s;urprized to &s;ee him there; and becau&s;e he ob&s;erved they were bu&s;y in embark|ing them&s;elves to get away to <HI>Strael&s;und, Dor|fling</HI> ordered a Body of 500 men, under the Com|mand of Major General <HI>Schoning,</HI> to advance a|long the &s;hore &s;ide, and put him&s;elf at the head of
<PB N="530" REF="274"> them with his drawn &s;word in his hand, to charge them. And whil&s;t they attackt the <HI>Swedes</HI> on one &s;ide, a part of their Cavalry lighted from their Hor&s;es, and attackt them on another, &s;o that the place was taken by a&s;&s;ault. A great Number of <HI>Swedes</HI> were put to the Sword in the fir&s;t heat of the attack, and 900 Foot, and 500 Hor&s;e were made Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Koning&s;mark,</HI> after he had &s;ignalized him|&s;elf, and done as much as man could do, leapt in|to a Boat, and got away from the Victors: pre|&s;ently after &s;ome Regiments were Commanded to go and attack the New Fort; but when the Cannon begun to batter the Ramparts, the Gar|ri&s;on that were <HI>Germans</HI> mutinied, and forced their Officers to &s;et open the Gates to the <HI>Bran|denburgers.</HI> Such was the de&s;tiny of a Fortre&s;s which the <HI>Danes</HI> had not been able to take, and which yet &s;urrendred at la&s;t without any re&s;i&s;t|ance to the Arms of the Elector of <HI>Brandenburg.</HI> The I&s;le of <HI>Danholm</HI> being afterwards attackt by 2000 men, &s;ubmitted likewi&s;e to the obedi|ence of the Trumphant Arms of the &s;ame E|lector. All tho&s;e happy &s;ucce&s;&s;es were followed by the &s;upplemental addition of the Town of <HI>Strael|&s;und,</HI> where Count <HI>Koning&s;mark</HI> was retreated with the &s;hattered relicks of his Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of 1600 Hor&s;e and 600 Musketeers, which yet after noble and &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, made by the valour and Conduct of the &s;aid Count, worthy to have &s;erved a more fortunate cau&s;e, was taken. This la&s;t Conque&s;t was &s;o much glo|rious for the Arms of his Electoral Highne&s;s, be|cau&s;e that place was counted one of the impor|tant ones of all <HI>Germany.</HI></P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Tromp,</HI> after he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at all the Conque&s;ts in the North, where he acquired a very great Reputation, Returned at length into his own Country, Honoured with the Glorious Titles of Baron, Knight and Count, conferred upon him
<PB N="531" REF="274"> by two Great Kings, in admiration of his in|comparable Merit.</P>
<P>The Place en&s;ued &s;oon after, and &s;ome Family con&s;iderations, be&s;ides &s;ome particular and pri|vate Di&s;contents, obliged him at length to quit the Sea and the publick Service till the Year 1691. And then a Mighty War ari&s;ing between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> the United Provinces, and mo&s;t of the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> he was lookt upon as the mo&s;t capable per&s;on to Command the States Fleet, to maintain and &s;upport the Glory the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have acquired by Sea &s;ince the ap|pearance of their Renowned Republick in the World.</P>
<P>And indeed the pre&s;ent King of <HI>England, Wil|liam</HI> III. had named him to Command the States Fleet as Admiral General for the Year 1691, and the people began already to flatter them&s;elves with a thou&s;and happy &s;ucce&s;&s;es from the Joy and Good-Will the Seamen unanimou&s;ly te&s;tified on that oc|ca&s;ion; but the <HI>French,</HI> who are Ingenious in fore|&s;eeing, thought it was nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e all &s;orts of means to prevent &s;o great an Evil as &s;eemed to threaten them on that &s;ide: they lookt upon <HI>Tromp</HI> to be the only man that could Traver&s;e their de&s;igns, and make head again&s;t their grow|ing Power at Sea, the Empire of which they pretend now to di&s;pute again&s;t both <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland:</HI> &s;o that if we may credit what has been reported, the Treacherous Intrigues of that Nation contributed to cure them&s;elves of the Umbrage and Apprehen&s;ion they had conceived of that Great man, by procuring him an unnatural Di|&s;temper to cut him off on a &s;udden. We will enter into no particulars about it; but 'tis too well known, that Court omits nothing to get the able&s;t Generals among&s;t their Enemies di&s;patcht out of the World by one means or other, when they prove deaf to their Charms, and incorruptible, and faithful to their Country.</P>

<P>However it were, the Incomparable <HI>Tromp</HI> fell &s;ick, whil&s;t the preparations for the Equipment of the Fleet were carrying on with all diligence.
