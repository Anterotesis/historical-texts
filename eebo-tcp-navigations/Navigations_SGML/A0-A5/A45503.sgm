<P><HI>HANSON</HI> perceiving that nothing by him offer'd did prove &s;atisfactory, re&s;olved (if po&s;&s;ible) to treat with Sir <HI>Richard</HI> for an amicable Compo|&s;ure of the Difference between them, and for that purpo&s;e prevailed (by the Interpo&s;ition of one of Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s neare&s;t Relations (a Per&s;on of great Quality) to be admitted into his Company, where according to the Direction of the Order of Council afore&s;aid; he offer'd to cea&s;e all Pro|&s;ecution at Law again&s;t him, for the Matters contained in his two latter Appeals, and to Seal to him the Relea&s;e thereby directed; Provided he would promi&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t him with his Intere&s;t for the obtaining a hearing upon his &s;aid Appeals, and in the getting back the 150 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Levied upon him for a Fine, and the 251 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> rai&s;ed by Sale of his Ship; and &s;o as he would undertake that there &s;hould be no further Proceedings again&s;t Capt. <HI>Young,</HI> or his Sureties, on the 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Bond.

<P>THEY all Three pleaded &s;everally.
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Feb.</HI> 6. 83/4.</NOTE></P>
<P>THEY prote&s;ted again&s;t the Information, adding, that the matter therein contained was not &s;ufficiently &s;et forth, and denied that they were guilty of any contempt again&s;t the King, or breach of his Laws in manner and form, as in the Information was &s;et forth; but for further Plea,</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY &s;aid, that upon the Con&s;truction of the Law, it is evident that the intent of entring into &s;uch Bonds as afore&s;aid, was only to &s;ecure
<PB N="14" REF="8">the Inhabitants of the I&s;land, who &s;hould have their Debtors or Slaves car|ried off without a Ticket.</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT by con&s;tant u&s;age the Governors have ever &s;ince the Act made, a&s;&s;igned over &s;uch Bonds to the Per&s;ons agrieved by the carrying off any Per&s;on contrary to the form of the Act, which Implies the Governors by that Act are only made Tru&s;tees for the Inhabitants in &s;uch Ca&s;es. <HI>Opti|ma e&s;t Legum Interpres Con&s;uetudo.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. ALL &s;uch A&s;&s;ignments as by the Act are directed, would be void, if the &s;aid Bonds &s;hould be con&s;trued to be made to the Governors in tru&s;t for the King; for in &s;uch Ca&s;e, the Governors connot A&s;&s;ign the King's Debt to any Per&s;on, E&s;pecially if not Creditors of the Kings.</P>
<P N="4">4. If it &s;hould be alledged that the King is damnified by <HI>Young</HI>'s carrying off <HI>Han&s;on,</HI> yet is the information defective in its not &s;etting forth wherein and how much of which the Court ought to judg, whereby the Defendants are outed of their Appeal granted by an Act of the I&s;land, Entituled, An Act for the e&s;tabli&s;hing the Court of Common Pleas within the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>HAVILAND</HI> and <HI>Fowler</HI> pleaded that the Attorney General had be|fore exhibited an Information again&s;t <HI>Young</HI> the Principal for the &s;aid 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> &s;uppo&s;ed due to the King, which they conceived amounted to a <HI>Prior</HI> Infor|mation.</P>
<P N="6">6. THEY in&s;i&s;ted that they ought not to be charged in that Court till re|turn made, That the Principal could not be found, or was in&s;olvent: <HI>Magna Charta</HI> Cap. 8. &s;aith as followeth, Neither &s;hall the Pledges of the Debtor be di&s;trained, as long as the Principal Debtor is &s;ufficient; if the Principal fail of Payment, having nothing wherewith to pay, or will not pay where able, then the Pledges to an&s;wer.</P>
<P N="7">7. THEY &s;ay, taking &s;uch Bonds by any Per&s;on for the u&s;e of the King, is expre&s;ly prohibited by the Act of 33. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. cap. 39. therefore the Act of that I&s;land cannot be con&s;trued to be repugnant to that Statute, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. THEY in&s;i&s;ted, that the &s;aid Bond if at all &s;uable for the King, ought not to be &s;ued in Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Name, all Bonds to the King's u&s;e being pro|hibited as afore&s;aid from being taken in any name but his own.</P>
<P N="9">9. THEY alledged that the Attorney General in his Informations hath not &s;hown that Sir <HI>Richard</HI> did a&s;&s;ign the &s;aid Bond to the King.</P>
<P N="10">10. THEY in&s;i&s;ted that the Attorney General in his Informations hath not cited the proper Acts whereby any Officer is impowered to take any &s;uch Bond with &s;uch Condition endor&s;ed as he pretends is forfeited to the King.</P>
<P N="11">11. THEY aver, that if the Information &s;hould be ruled right to lye, then Judgmeet would be entred for 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and no relief again&s;t the intire penalty to be had, tho the Damages de&s;igned by the Act to be made good, &s;hould not amount to a 20th part thereof, which would be a grievance expre&s;ly a|gain&s;t the Letter of the Law, and contrary to the con&s;tant practice of re|covering Damages upon the &s;aid Statute.</P>
<P N="12">12. THEY add, that by this method of proceedure they &s;hould be depri|ved of the benefit of their Appeals expre&s;ly provided for by the Act for &s;et|ling the Court of Common Pleas, for that being a Court Inferior to this high Court, cannot be appealed to, from any Judgment given here; &s;o that they mu&s;t be left without any Adju&s;tment of the Damages, which by the Law they are bound to repay, which the Act directs to be done by Court of <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> in Ca&s;es where any Penalties are recovered. And there|fore directs that all tho&s;e Bonds &s;hall be Sued in that Court.</P>
<P N="13">13. THE Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> cannot own a Juri&s;diction in Ca&s;e of Appeal from the Court of <HI>Exchequer,</HI> becau&s;e it is not provided for by a &s;pecial Provi&s;o in the Act, which con&s;titutes that Court; e&s;pecially, be|cau&s;e the Court of <HI>Exchequer</HI> was not then E&s;tabli&s;ht; but hath been
<PB N="15" REF="8">&s;ince Erected with a &s;uperiority over that of the <HI>Common Pleas.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. IF Bonds of this Nature &s;hould be adjudged in con&s;truction of Law, to Oblige the Obligor for the whole penalty, for every little or &s;ingle Breach thereof, then will the whole I&s;land be left, for it will ruin all Trade and Comerce with them, from all parts of the World.</P>
<P>BECAUSE no prudent Man will at any time after, become bound with any Ma&s;ter of a Ship in &s;uch Penalty, and under &s;uch Conditions, when he &s;hall find that for the &s;malle&s;t of Crimes committed the &s;ame &s;hall be declar|ed, Forfeited to the King.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e and other rea&s;ons, they pray'd the Informations might abate.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es were continued till next Court.

<P>THEY all three Pleaded, and in each of their Pleas,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mar.</HI> 22. 83/4.</NOTE> recited the Act which impowers the Governour to take &s;uch Bonds; and averr'd, that the King ought not to have Judgment.

<P>THE Attorney General by Prote&s;tation,

<P>THAT the Defendants alledged in their Plea, That as to any thing contrary to the peace of the King, or in Contempt of the Law, they are not Guilty; and of that, put them&s;elves on the Country; &s;o did the Attorney General, who</P>

<P><HI>YO&V;NG</HI> finding him&s;elf and Sureties, thus pro&s;ecuted; he, when he came back to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> made over to <HI>Haviland</HI> and <HI>Fowler</HI> a Bond of 5000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> penalty, which <HI>Han&s;on</HI> had in <HI>London</HI> voluntarily given him, to &s;ave him harmle&s;s from any Damage that might ari&s;e by rea&s;on of his bring|ing him to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had they that Bond, than to &s;ecure them&s;elves, they put it in Suit in the Court of <HI>Exchequer,</HI> where (tho <HI>Han&s;on</HI> was in <HI>England</HI>) that Court forc't his Attornies to appear for him (howbeit their Letters of

<P><HI>HANSON</HI> being in <HI>London,</HI> and hearing of the&s;e Proceedings (ju&s;t as he was going over, and after his goods and all things were on Board in order to his Voyage) re&s;olved to &s;tay here and pro&s;ecute his Appeals, for which purpo&s;e he took all his Cloaths on Shore, and &s;uffer'd the &s;aid Ship to fall into the <HI>Downs;</HI> but advi&s;ing with Sir <HI>Richard</HI>'s Friend, who was pre&s;ent when the Agreement afore&s;aid was made, and who afterward very kindly had carried <HI>Han&s;on</HI> to ki&s;s His Maje&s;ties Hand before his Departure, he per|&s;waded him by all means to proceed on his Voyage a&s;&s;uring him that he was con&s;ident, that when Sir <HI>Richard</HI> &s;hould arrive on the I&s;land, all pro|ceedings again&s;t him would be &s;topt, and his Promi&s;e and Undertaking be made good; and gave him a Letter to Sir <HI>Richard</HI> to pre&s;s the &s;ame; upon which he followed the Ship into the <HI>Downs,</HI> and went to <HI>Barbodoes;</HI> where when he came and waited on Sir <HI>Richard,</HI> he was acquainted with all the matters afore&s;aid at large, and told that he had given account thereof to his Maje&s;ty, and &s;ent to know his Royal Plea&s;ure therein: But what Letter he writ, or whether he gave account of the agreement afore&s;aid between them, or of the nature of the Law that directs the taking Bonds, or the de&s;truction that it would be to the Navigation of the I&s;land if &s;uch a Pre&s;i|dent were made and led in example, he knows not.

<P>WHICH Order was made without the &s;aid <HI>Han&s;ons</HI> being heard, or any on his behalf; and grounded on a Report made by his Maje&s;ties Attorney General, whereby he declared his Opinion to be, that <HI>Young</HI>'s Bond was forfeited to the King by the bringing <HI>Han&s;on</HI> into <HI>England;</HI> and by the wording of the Order, it &s;eems to be grounded upon <HI>Han&s;on</HI>'s having given &s;ecurity to <HI>Young</HI> to &s;ave him harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner did this Order arrive on the I&s;land, than <HI>Han&s;on</HI> was &s;ent for, told thereof, and required to pay the Money, which was impo&s;&s;ible for him to do on a &s;udden, &s;uch a Sum not being to be had on the I&s;land in a &s;hort time.

<P>FIRST, Prayed the Liberty to bring his Appeal, and offered to give 10000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Security to abide &s;uch Order of his Maje&s;ty in Council as &s;hould be made upon the hearing thereof, and to pay the Money in <HI>London,</HI> if not relieved by that mo&s;t Honourable Board; this Sir <HI>Richard</HI> denied, a&s;&s;uring him he had nothing to do therewith, but referred him to Mr <HI>Steed,</HI> who de|clared the &s;ame, adding that he was no otherways concern'd than to receive and return the Money, when Levied and paid to him.</P>
