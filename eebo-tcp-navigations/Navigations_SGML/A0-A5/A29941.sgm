<P>TOuching the name of <HI>London,</HI> from what occa&s;ion the City &s;hould be &s;o denominated, divers Authors conceit di|ver&s;ly.</P>
<P>Some are of opinion, that <HI>London</HI> took the name of <HI>Lud&s;tone</HI>; for King <HI>Lud</HI> not onely repaired this City, but al&s;o increa&s;|ed the &s;ame with fair buildings, Towers, and Walls, and after his own name, cal|led it <HI>Cair Lud, i. e.</HI> the Town of <HI>Lud,</HI> and the &s;trong Gate, which he erected, in the we&s;t part of the City, he likewi&s;e for their own honour and reputation na|med it <HI>Ludgate.</HI></P>
<P>Others &s;ay, it is &s;o called from the word <HI>Llhwn</HI>; for &s;eeing <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Stra|bo</HI> do write, that the ancient Britains cal|led tho&s;e woods, and Groves by the names of Cities, and Towns which they had fenced with Trees, ca&s;t down and pla&s;hed, to &s;top up the pa&s;&s;age; and &s;ee|ing that &s;uch VVoods or Groves are in the Britti&s;h tongue named <HI>Llhwn,</HI> they are in inclined to the opinion, that <HI>Lon|don</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="9">
thence took name, as one would &s;ay, by way of excellency, the City, or a Ci|ty thick of Trees.</P>
<P>Again, Others are of opinion (which &s;eemeth to be the mo&s;t probable) that whence <HI>London</HI> had the &s;ame, there al&s;o it took the name, even from Ships which the Brittains in their dialect call <HI>Longh</HI>; &s;o that <HI>Londinum</HI> may &s;eem to &s;ound as much as a Ship Road, or City of Ships: for the Brittains term a City <HI>Dinas,</HI> whence the the Latines have fetch'd their <HI>Dinum.</HI> And hence it is, that el&s;ewhere it is cal|led <HI>Longidinum,</HI> and in the Funeral Song of a mo&s;t ancient Britti&s;h Poet, <HI>Llong Porth,</HI> that is an Harbour or Haven of Ships: And by this very term <HI>Bononia,</HI> or <HI>Bolea</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> calleth <HI>Ge&s;&s;ori|acum Novale,</HI> in the Britti&s;h Glo&s;&s;ary is named <HI>Bolung-Long.</HI> For many Cities have drawn their names from Ships, as <HI>Naupactus, Nau&s;tathmas, Nauplia, Nava|lia Augu&s;ti,</HI> &amp;c.

<HEAD><HI>2.</HI> The Aldermen.</HEAD>
<P>IN relation to Aldermen three things are worthy of notice, <HI>&s;c.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Etymology of the words (Alderman, and Senator.)</P>
<P>An Alderman is among the Romans, <HI>Laticlavius, Senator,</HI> and <HI>Optimas.</HI></P>
<P>An Alderman from the <HI>Saxon</HI> word Ealderman, <HI>i. e. Senex, quod Senes &s;olum|modo illum dignitatis gradum accipiant</HI>: Hence among the Latins, he is called Senator.</P>
<P><HI>Gothofredus</HI> tells us, that <HI>Senatores dicti non &s;unt ab a&s;&s;entiendo,</HI> as <HI>Hugoli|nus,</HI> and <HI>Bartolus</HI> &s;uppo&s;e, but <HI>&agrave; &s;enili aetate,</HI> or <HI>&agrave; virtute,</HI> for heretofore, <HI>Senes apud Romanos Viri optimi appellati &s;unt.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="23"><HI>Olim apud Britones</HI> (&s;ayes one) <HI>tem|poribus Romanorum in regno i&s;to Britanniae vocabantur Senatores qui po&s;tea temporibus Saxonum vocabantur Aldermanas, non propter aetatem, &s;ed propter &s;apientiam, &amp; dignitatem, c&ugrave;m quidam adole&s;centes e&s;&s;ent, Juri&s;periti tamen &amp; &s;uper hoc experti.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Their election; The Aldermen of <HI>London</HI> were changed by election every year, until 28. E. 3. Then it was or|dered, that they &s;hould not be removed, without &s;ome &s;pecial cau&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Co.</HI> 4. <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 253.</NOTE> But <HI>Rot.

And &s;o it &s;till continueth.</P>

<P><HI>Quaere</HI> 1. Whence the word Sheriffs is derived?</P>
<P><HI>Re&s;p.</HI> Sheriff is a word compounded of two <HI>Saxon</HI> words, viz. <HI>Shire,</HI> and <HI>Reve, Shire, Satrapia,</HI> or <HI>Comitatus,</HI> cometh out of the <HI>Saxon</HI> verb <HI>Shiram,</HI> i. e. <HI>partivi,</HI> for that the whole Realm is parted, and divided into Shires.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co.
