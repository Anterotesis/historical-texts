<HEAD><HI>The Common-wealths Ship, common|ly called the</HI> Soveraign <HI>of the Seas, with her bulke, and burden.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_BEFORE I come to give you a true and exact Dimen&s;ion of her bulke, burden, &amp;c. it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary that I make &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the world concerning tho&s;e Decorements which <HI>beautifie</HI> and <HI>adorne her,</HI> and to render a faire account of mine owne invention concerning the <HI>carving worke,</HI> the <HI>Figures,</HI> and <HI>Mottoes</HI> upon them, which &s;ome perhaps have too liberally taxed: Thus therefore to any who have formerly either doubted of their propriety, or are at this pre&s;ent de&s;irous to under&s;tand their imagined ob&s;curity, I thus freely deliver my &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Beak-head</HI> &s;itteth royall King <HI>Edgar</HI> on hor&s;e|backe, trampling upon &s;even Kings.</P>
<P>Concerning tho&s;e Kings whom you may perceive to lye pro&s;trate under his Hor&s;es hoofes, they were <HI>Kynadus,</HI> King of the <HI>Scots, Malcolme,</HI> King of <HI>Cumberland;</HI> and of the pet|ty Kings of <HI>Wales, Dufnall, Grifith, Huvall, Jacob, Judithil.</HI> He moreover &s;urprized by Sea a Prince of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who&s;e name was <HI>Maxentius,</HI> who had done many out-rages upon the <HI>Ocean,</HI> and was the greate&s;t Arch-pirate that tho&s;e times afforded. He al&s;o compelled <HI>Ludwallus,</HI> prime Prince and King of <HI>Cambria,</HI> which is <HI>Wales,</HI> (becau&s;e he would have all the ravenous &amp; dammageous Bea&s;ts to be de&s;troyed through the Land) to pay unto him yearly by way of Tribute, three
<PB N="4" REF="4"> hundred Wolves skins: by rea&s;on whereof, within the &s;pace of forty yeares after, in <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Wales,</HI> both which (but e&s;pecially <HI>Wales)</HI> who before were mi&s;erably infe&s;ted with that kind of bea&s;t, there was &s;carcely to be fouud one Wolfe alive: and &s;o much for the Princes over which he had &s;ole dominion.</P>
<P><HI>His Navy Royall con&s;i&s;ted of three thou&s;and and &s;ixe hundred Ships, (&s;uch as they u&s;ed in tho&s;e dayes) yet not any of them but &s;erviceable either for Fight, or bearing Victuall, and munition, to furni&s;h the Navy, which he divided into three parts, appointing to every of them a &s;everall &s;quadron: and this hee did to &s;ecure Navi|gators from</HI> Enemies, <HI>and</HI> Sea-Rovers, <HI>as al&s;o from all other neighbour Princes, who might challenge any intere&s;t in the&s;e our</HI> foure Seas. <HI>And therefore every</HI> Spring <HI>and</HI> Summer, <HI>he in per|&s;on &s;ayled with tho&s;e in the Ea&s;t parts, to them that lay hovering in the</HI> We&s;t. <HI>And &s;ending them backe againe with their Charge, would with the</HI> We&s;t &s;quadrant, <HI>&s;aile into the</HI> North, <HI>and after with the</HI> Northern <HI>Fleet compa&s;&s;e into the</HI> Ea&s;t, <HI>by which the</HI> Maine Ocean <HI>rounding tho&s;e I&s;lands, of which he was &s;ole</HI> Prince <HI>and</HI> Monarch, <HI>being at his onely charge, both quieted and &s;ecured, he did (as ju&s;tly he might) write him&s;elfe</HI> Lord of the foure Seas.</P>
<P>I began at the <HI>Beak-head,</HI> where I de&s;ire you to take no|tice, that upon the &s;temme-head there is <HI>Cupid,</HI> or a Child re&s;embling him, be&s;triding and bridling a <HI>Lyon,</HI> which im|porteth, <HI>That &s;ufferance may curbe In&s;olence, and Innocence re|&s;traine violence.</HI></P>
<P>On the Bulk-head right forward, &s;tand &s;ix &s;everall Statues in &s;undry po&s;tures, their Figures repre&s;enting <HI>Con&s;ilium,</HI> that is, Coun&s;ell: <HI>Cura,</HI> that is, Care: <HI>Conamen,</HI> that is, Indu&s;try, and unanimous indeavour in one compartment: <HI>Coun&s;ell</HI> holding in her hand <HI>a clo&s;ed or folded Scrole; Care,</HI> a Sea-com|pa&s;&s;e; <HI>Conamen,</HI> or <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> a Lint &s;tock fixed. Upon the o|ther, to corre&s;pond with the former, <HI>Vis,</HI> which implyeth <HI>force,</HI> or <HI>&s;trength;</HI> handing a Sword. <HI>Virtus,</HI> or <HI>Vertue,</HI> a &s;phearicall Globe: and <HI>Victoria,</HI> or <HI>Victory,</HI> a wreath of <HI>Law|rell.</HI> The <HI>Morall</HI> is, that in all high Enterprizes there ought to be fir&s;t <HI>Coun&s;ell,</HI> to undertake; then <HI>Care,</HI> to manage; and
<PB N="5" REF="4"> <HI>Indu&s;try,</HI> to performe; and in the next place, where there is <HI>ability</HI> and <HI>&s;trength</HI> to oppo&s;e, and <HI>Vertue</HI> to direct, <HI>Victory</HI> con&s;equently is alwayes at hand, ready to crowne the un|dertaking.</P>
<P>Upon the Hances of the wa&s;te are foure Figures, with their &s;everall properties: <HI>Jupiter</HI> riding upon his <HI>Eagle,</HI> with his <HI>Tri&s;ulke</HI> (from which he darteth <HI>Thunder)</HI> in his hand: <HI>Mars</HI> with his <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Target,</HI> a <HI>Foxe</HI> being his Embleme: <HI>Nep|tune</HI> with his <HI>Sea-hor&s;e, Dolphin,</HI> and <HI>Trident:</HI> and la&s;tly, <HI>Aeo|lus</HI> upon a <HI>Camelion</HI> (a Bea&s;t that liveth only by the Ayre) with the <HI>foure Windes,</HI> his Mini&s;ters or Agents, the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> cal'd <HI>Eurus, Sub&s;olanus,</HI> and <HI>Apeliotes:</HI> the <HI>North-winde,</HI> Septentrio, Aquilo, <HI>or</HI> Boreas: <HI>the We&s;t,</HI> Zephyrus, Favonius, Lybs, <HI>and</HI> Africus: <HI>the South, Au&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Notus.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to the Stearn, where you may perceive upon the upright of the upper Counter, &s;tandeth <HI>Victory</HI> in the middle of a Fronti&s;piece, with this generall motto, <HI>Validis incumbite remus:</HI> It is &s;o plain, that I &s;hall not need to give it an <HI>Engli&s;h interpretation:</HI> Her wings are equally di&s;played; on one Arme &s;he weareth a <HI>Crowne,</HI> on the other a <HI>Lawrel,</HI> which imply <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Honour:</HI> in her two hands &s;he holdeth two Mottoes; her <HI>right hand,</HI> which pointeth to <HI>Ja&s;on,</HI> bears this In&s;cription, <HI>Nava. Ja&s;on</HI> being figured with his Oare in his hand, as being the prime <HI>Argonant,</HI> and &s;ay <HI>Nava,</HI> or more plainly, <HI>Operam nava;</HI> for in tho&s;e Emblematicall Mottoes, <HI>quod &s;ubintelligitur, non dee&s;t.</HI> She pointeth to <HI>Hercules</HI> on the fini&s;ter &s;ide, with his <HI>Club</HI> in his hand, with this motto, <HI>O</HI> Hercules, <HI>be thou as valiant with thy Club upon the Land, as</HI> Ja&s;on <HI>is indu&s;trious with his Oare upon the Water. Hercules</HI> again poin|ting to <HI>Aeolus,</HI> the god of <HI>Windes,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Flato:</HI> who an&s;wereth him againe, <HI>Flo: Ja&s;on</HI> pointing to <HI>Neptune,</HI> the god of the Seas (riding upon a <HI>Sea hor&s;e)</HI> &s;aith <HI>Favelo;</HI> to whom <HI>Nep|tune</HI> an&s;wereth, <HI>No;</HI> The&s;e words <HI>Flo,</HI> and <HI>No,</HI> were al&s;o much excepted at, as if there had been no &s;uch Latine words, till &s;ome better examining their <HI>Gramar Rules,</HI> found out <HI>Flo, flas, flavi,</HI> proper to <HI>Aeolus,</HI> and <HI>No, nas, navi,</HI> to <HI>Neptune,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>In the lower Counter of the <HI>Sterne,</HI> on either &s;ide of the <HI>Helme</HI> is this In&s;cription,
<Q><L><HI>He who Seas, Windes, and Navies doth protect,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Soveraign, the great</HI> Ship <HI>in her cour&s;e direct.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>There are other things in this <HI>Ve&s;&s;ell</HI> worthy remarkable, at lea&s;t, if not admiration; namely, that one <HI>Tree,</HI> or <HI>Oake,</HI> made foure of the <HI>principall beames</HI> of this <HI>great Ship,</HI> which was 44. foote of &s;trong and &s;erviceable <HI>Timber</HI> in <HI>length,</HI> three foote <HI>Diametre</HI> at the top, and ten foote <HI>Diametre</HI> at the &s;tubb or bottome.</P>
<P>Another (as worthy of e&s;peciall ob&s;ervation is) that one piece of Timber which made the <HI>Kel-&s;on,</HI> was &s;o great and weighty, that 28. <HI>Oxen,</HI> and foure <HI>Hor&s;es,</HI> with much difficulty drew it from the place where it grew, and from whence it was cut downe, unto the water-&s;ide.</P>
<P>There is one thing above all the&s;e for the world to take e|&s;peciall notice of, that <HI>&s;hee</HI> is, be&s;ides her <HI>Tunnage,</HI> ju&s;t &s;o many <HI>Tuns</HI> in burden, as there have been years &s;ince our <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed Saviours Incarnation,</HI> namely, 1637. and not one under, or over: A mo&s;t happy <HI>Omen,</HI> which though it was not at the fir&s;t projected or intended, is now by true computation found &s;o to happen.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to in&s;i&s;t upon every Ornament belonging to this incomparable <HI>Ve&s;&s;ell,</HI> yet thus much con|cerning Her outward appearance; She hath two Galleries of a &s;ide, and all of mo&s;t curious carved Worke, and all the &s;ides of the <HI>&s;hipp</HI> are carved al&s;o with <HI>Trophies</HI> of <HI>Artyllerie</HI> and <HI>Types</HI> of honour, as well belonging to Land as Sea, with Symboles, Emblemes, and Impre&s;&s;es appertaining to the <HI>Art of Navigation:</HI> and thus much in a &s;uccinct way. I have deli|vered unto you concerning her inward and outward De|corements; I come now to de&s;cribe her in her exect Dimen|&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her length by the Keele is 128. foote, or thereabout, with|in &s;ome few inches. Her mayne breadth or widene&s;&s;e from &s;ide to &s;ide 48. foote. Her utmo&s;t length from the fore-end of the <HI>Beake-head,</HI> unto the after end of the Sterne, <HI>a prora ad pup|pim,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="5"> 232. foote; Shee is in height from the bottome of her Keele to the top of her <HI>Lanthorne,</HI> &s;eventy &s;ixe foot, &s;he bea|reth five <HI>Lanthorns,</HI> the bigge&s;t of which will hold ten per|&s;ons to &s;tand upright, and without &s;houldring or pre&s;&s;ing one the other.</P>
<P>Shee hath three flu&s;h Deckes, and a Fore-Ca&s;tle, an halfe Decke, a quarter Deck, and a round-hou&s;e. <HI>Her</HI> lower <HI>Tyre</HI> hath thirty ports, which are to be furni&s;hed with Demy-Conon and whole Canon throughout, being able to beare them. Her middle <HI>Tyre</HI> hath al&s;o thirty ports for Demi-Culverin, and whole Culverin. Her third <HI>Tyre</HI> hath 26. ports for other Ordnance; her Fore-Ca&s;tle hath twelve ports, and her halfe Decke hath fourteen ports; Shee hath thirteene or fourteene ports more within board for murder|ing peeces, be&s;ides a great many Loop holes out of the Ca|bins for Musket-&s;hot. She carrieth moreover tenne peeces of cha&s;e <HI>Ordnance</HI> in her, right forward, and ten right off, that is according to Land-&s;ervice in the front and the reare. She carrieth eleven <HI>Anchors,</HI> one of them weighing foure thou|&s;and foure hundred, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and according to the&s;e are her Ca|bles, Ma&s;ts, Sayles, and Cordage.</P>
<P>I come now to give you a particular Denomination of the prime Work-men employed in this inimitable Fabrick; as fir&s;t Captaine <HI>Phines Pett,</HI> Over-&s;eer of the Work, and one of the Principall Officers; of who&s;e knowledge, experience, and judgment, I cannot render a merited <HI>Character.</HI></P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter <HI>Builder</HI> is young Mr. <HI>Peter Pett,</HI> the mo&s;t inge|nuous &s;onne of &s;o much improved a <HI>Father,</HI> who before he was full 25. yeares of age, made the <HI>Modell,</HI> and &s;ince hath perfected the <HI>worke,</HI> which hath won not only the <HI>approbati|on,</HI> but <HI>admiration</HI> of all men, of whom I may truly &s;ay, as <HI>Horace</HI> did of <HI>Argus,</HI> that famous <HI>Ship-ma&s;ter,</HI> (Who built the great <HI>Argo</HI> in which the <HI>Grecian</HI> Princels Rowed through the <HI>Helle &s;pont</HI> to fetch the <HI>goleen Fleece</HI> from <HI>Colchos.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pallas</HI> her &s;elf flew into his bo&s;ome, and not only enjoyn'd him to the undertaking, but in&s;pired him in the managing of &s;o exqui&s;ite anab&s;olute an <HI>Architecture.</HI></P>

<P>VPON <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 18. of <HI>May,</HI> 1652. in the morn|ing, General <HI>Blake</HI> being gone to the We&s;t-ward, as far as <HI>Rye</HI> Bay eight dayes before, with twelve or thirteen Ships, leaving Major <HI>Bourn</HI> in the <HI>Downs</HI> with eight Ships only, there appeared upon the back &s;ide of the <HI>Goodwin,</HI> a <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet of Men of War, con&s;i&s;ting of two and forty Ships, one whereof had a Flagg on the main-top-Ma&s;t head, the re&s;t Jacks and Ancients; and being come unto the South-&s;ands head, two of them bore up towards the En|gli&s;h Ships in the <HI>Downs,</HI> whereupon Major <HI>Bourn</HI> &s;ent out the
<PB N="12" REF="8"> <HI>Greyhound</HI> to examine them, and to know the rea&s;on of their &s;o near approach; who an&s;wering, That they had a Me&s;&s;age to the Commander in Chief in the <HI>Downes,</HI> were permitted to come in; and having &s;aluted the Flag, the two Captains, named <HI>Ty&s;on</HI> and <HI>Aldred</HI> came aboard the &s;ayd Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and acquanted him that they were &s;ent by <HI>Van Trump,</HI> to let him know that he had been Riding about <HI>Dunkirke</HI> with His Fleet, where by rea&s;on of foule Weather they had lo&s;t many of their Cables and Anchors, and the wind being <HI>Northerly,</HI> were driven more to the <HI>Southward</HI> then they intended, which <HI>Van Trump</HI> thought fit to &s;ignifie, to prevent any mi&s;-appre|hen&s;ions or Jealou&s;ies. And having &s;aid this, and received for an&s;wer, That the Reality of what they &s;aid would be&s;t appear by their &s;peedy drawing off from this Coa&s;t, they de|parted to their Fleet; and immediately upon their arrivall with them, the whole Fleet &s;tood up to <HI>Dover,</HI> and came to an Anchor within little more then &s;hot of the Ca&s;tle the &s;ame day in the afternoon. Upon their coming before <HI>Dover</HI> Ca|&s;tle, and Riding there with Flag in the Main-top, without &s;aluting the Ca&s;tle, the Ca&s;tle made three &s;hot at them; not|with&s;tanding which, the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admirall kept up his Flagg, and rode there at <HI>Anchor</HI> until the next day noon, and exer|ci&s;ed his Mu&s;quetiers, by di&s;charging volleys of &s;mall &s;hot many houres together. Upon <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> about twelve a clock the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet weighed Anchor, and &s;tood off towards <HI>Calice</HI> &s;ome four Leagues into the <HI>South-ea&s;t;</HI> about the &s;ame time the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet under General <HI>Blake</HI> coming from the We&s;t towards the <HI>Downes,</HI> di&s;covered them, and &s;uppo&s;ed by their cour&s;e they had been going back; Major <HI>Bourn</HI> likewi&s;e was in &s;ight, coming from the <HI>Downs</HI> to joyn with Generall <HI>Blake.</HI> About an hour or two after, the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet altered their cour&s;e, came back again, made all the Saile they could, and bore directly with Generall <HI>Blake, Van Trump</HI> the head|mo&s;t with his Flag in the Main-top; and being come within &s;hot, the Generall &s;hot a Gun at his Main-top, and then two &s;ingle &s;hot more: whereupon <HI>Trump</HI> &s;hot a &s;ingle &s;hot through the Generals Flag, and then immediately gave the fir&s;t Broad &s;ide, and took in his Pendants, and hung out his Red Flagg
<PB N="13" REF="8"> under the <HI>Holland</HI> Colours, which was the Signal on their part for their whole Fleet to engage, and &s;o the Fight began, which happened between four and five a clock in the after|noon, and continued until nine of the clock. In the Fight the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> took two of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet, one whereof having &s;ix foot water in the Hold they left, taking the Captain and Officers aboard, the other being a Ship of thirty Guns. Ge|nerall <HI>Blake</HI> lay all night where the Fight began, or neere thereabouts, and the Holland Fleet was e&s;pyed about foure Leagues di&s;tant towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>France</HI> next morning.</P>
<P>The truth of this Relation appears in the Letters of Gene|rall <HI>Blake,</HI> Major <HI>Bourn,</HI> and others in the Action, by the Examinations of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Captains, and other Officers ta|ken in the Fight:</P>
<P>And whereas <HI>Van Trump</HI> in the accompt he gives of this A|ction, makes the occa&s;ion of his coming back upon the <HI>Engl|i&s;h</HI> Fleet, the guarding of &s;ome Merchant men richly laden from the <HI>Streights,</HI> which had been in fight with &s;ome of our Frigots: That action is &s;et down in a letter written by Cap|tain <HI>Young,</HI> whereby the occa&s;ion, beginning and ending thereof is declared: And be&s;ides, the&s;e very &s;hips which hee pretends to come to protect or re&s;cue, upon Saturday be|fore had pa&s;&s;ed by General <HI>Blake,</HI> and were gone to the Ea&s;t|ward.</P>

<P><HI>Harlem in Holland, Decemb.</HI> 30. 1653. On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> la&s;t there ro&s;e a very great &s;torm, which continued all night, there being between fifty and &s;ix|ty Merchants riding at Anchor at the <HI>Texel,</HI> many of them are &s;unk and ca&s;t away, but 17 &s;aved between 30 and 40 are at be&s;t &s;poiled, &s;unk. and run a ground, and of them no lo&s;t, among&s;t the re&s;t there was one <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> &s;hip called the <HI>Lilly</HI> lo&s;t, that was going out, and the <HI>Marigold</HI> is much hurt and &s;hatter'd. One tore and &s;unk another Divers of them have been driven a&s;hore and &s;ome upon Shelves and Rocks, and many are lo&s;t in &s;everall parts. What the particular lo&s;&s;es have been cannot yet be collected. But the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Fleet at Sea, being 150 &s;hips, are much feared. At <HI>Am&s;ter|dam</HI> al&s;o &s;ome hurt was done by this &s;torm, for without the gate of the Ci|ty, by the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Bole.</HI> a Malt-Mill of <HI>Stephen Paters,</HI> fell on fire with the violence of the motion, whereby not onely the Mill but four Hou&s;es that &s;tood by it were burnt, to the great lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Stephen Pater,</HI> who had much <HI>Malt</HI> lay there. Al&s;o within the City, the iron Cro&s;&s;e (that is about 20 foot long, and weighed 14 or 1600 l.) that &s;tood upon the We&s;t Church lately built, the Weathercock above it, and the great Copper gilded Bowle under it, which held near a Hog&s;tead of Beer, were all blown down through the body of the Church, falling on the Grave &s;tones brake them, and tore the dead bodies in their Graves. But the greate&s;t lo&s;&s;e I hear of was at <HI>Rype</HI> in <HI>North Holland,</HI> where an Oyl-Mill by the &s;torm, in a violent motion by its own heat &s;et fire, and that burning &s;et divers Hou&s;es on fire, &s;ome 5 or 6 hundred Hou&s;es were de&s;troyed, and many per&s;ons burnt alive, and a|bundance of Goods, many being taken in their Beds, and others burnt be|fore they could get out of doors. And not onely the private Hou&s;es, but the two Churches, Town-hou&s;e, and the Way hou&s;e al&s;o as is &s;aid, are all laid in a&s;hes. And the fire &s;taid not in this Town, but flew over the River &s;ixty foot broad, that goes about the <HI>Bem&s;ter,</HI> and upon the in&s;ide of the bank of the <HI>Bem&s;ter,</HI> burnt divers Hou&s;es al&s;o; and burnt the very &s;hips (though &s;mall ones) and Boats that lay in the Haven; be&s;ides what harm it hath done in other parts not herein mentioned.</P>
