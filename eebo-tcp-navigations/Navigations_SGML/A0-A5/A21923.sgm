<P>_THE Queenes Maie&s;tie hauing had of late time con&s;ideration of great dearth growen in &s;undry parts of her Realme, iudging that the rich Owners of corne would keepe their &s;tore from common Markets, thereby to increa&s;e the prices thereof, and &s;o the multitude of her poore people hauing no graine growing of their owne, to &s;u&s;teine great lacke, cau&s;ed &s;peciall orders to be made and publi|&s;hed to all parts of her Realme, in what &s;ort the Iu&s;tices of peace in euery quar|ter &s;hould &s;tay all Ingro&s;&s;ers, Fore&s;tallers, and Regraters of Corne, and to di|rect all Owners and Farmers hauing Corne to furni&s;h the Markets ratably and weekly with &s;uch quantities as v&s;ually they had done before time, or rea|&s;onably might and ought to doe: By which orders, many other things were pre&s;cribed to be ob&s;erued for the &s;taying of the dearth, and reliefe of the people: Yet neuerthele&s;&s;e, her Maie&s;tie is informed, that in &s;ome parts of her Realme the dearth doth not dimini&s;h, but rather increa&s;e for lacke of due execution of the &s;ayd orders, and &s;pecially by the couetou&s;nes of the Owners, forbearing to furni&s;h the Markets, as rea&s;onably they might do, and by &s;ecretly &s;elling out of their hou&s;es to a kinde of people that commonly are called Badgers, at prices vnrea&s;onable, who likewi&s;e do &s;ell and regrate the &s;ame out of the Markets at very high and exce&s;&s;iue prices. For remedy whereof, her Maie&s;tie chargeth all officers to whom the ob&s;eruation of the &s;ayd orders hath bene directed, pre&s;ently as they haue any naturall care of their Chri&s;tian brethren &amp; Countreymen, being in need, to cau&s;e all and euery part of the &s;ayd orders from point to point to be executed, and the offenders again&s;t the fame to be &s;euerely puni&s;hed, to the terrour of others. And be&s;ides this manife&s;t cau&s;e giuen of vnnece&s;&s;arie increa&s;e of prices, there is &s;pred among&s;t her people by the &s;ayd Ingro&s;&s;ers and Regraters a fal&s;e report, that there &s;hould be much quantitie of Corne caried by Sea out of the Realme, and thereby occa&s;ion giuen of want of Corne to &s;erue for the nece&s;&s;ary v&s;e of the people of the Realme: By which fal&s;e report, not onely her Maie|&s;ties poore people are di&s;comforted with the feare of lacke for their &s;u&s;tenance, but al&s;o the couetous owners of Corne do pretend to pre&s;erue their &s;tore, and thereby doe refraine to &s;erue the Markets: which &s;landerous re|port, her Maie&s;tie doth affirme, for any thing to her knowledge, or for any licence, or &s;ufferance for carying any Corne out of the Realme, to be vntrue. And yet neuerthele&s;&s;e, for that contrary to her Maie&s;ties will, there may be &s;ome fraud v&s;ed in &s;ome parts of the Realme, either by her owne officers or by others, where Corne is prouided in &s;ome one part of her Realme, to be caried by Sea to &s;ome other place that is knowen to haue need thereof, notwith&s;tanding by the very &s;peciall orders of all the Ports, there ought none to be caried from Port to Port, but vpon &s;peciall bonds in great &s;ummes of money to be taken of the owners of the Ships and of the Corne, where &s;uch tran&s;portation &s;hall be made, for the true cariage of the &s;ame to the Ports therein named, and not by any colour or pretence to carie the &s;ame out of the Realme: And therefore for further proui&s;ion to be made for auoiding of &s;uch fraud, be&s;ides &s;uch bondes to be taken, her Maie&s;tie commandeth and giueth li|cence to any per&s;on that &s;hall haue cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect that any &s;uch Corne is or &s;hould be &s;hipped, or prouided to be &s;hipped, by lawfull authoritie to be caried to any other Port, that the &s;ame may be by fraud caried out of the Realme, &s;uch per&s;on hauing &s;uch cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, &s;hall giue information thereof to any Iu&s;tice of peace or pub|like officer dwelling nere to y^e Port, which Iu&s;tice or officer &s;hal with the &s;aid Informer repaire to the Cu&s;tome hou&s;e of any &s;uch Port or Creeke where Corne is &s;hipped, or prouided to be &s;hipped, and there &s;hall duly examine both the officers of the Cu&s;tome hou&s;e, &amp; the &s;ellers, buyers, &amp; &s;hippers of the Corne, vpon their &s;euerall othes, whether they know of any intention directly or indirectly to haue the &s;aid corne to be caried out of the Realme.
<PB REF="2" MS="y"> And further al&s;o when by their othes they &s;hall cleare them&s;elues of any &s;uch intention (thereby the &s;u&s;pi|cion conceiued being cleared) yet the officers of the Ports, that haue authoritie to take bonds, &s;hal &s;hew the par|ties, who vpon &s;u&s;picion &s;hall require the &s;ame, and giue them in writing the contents of the bond with the names of the parties bound, being &s;ufficient to an&s;were the &s;ame, the true quantitie of the graine, and the Ports, to which it is intended to haue the &s;ame caried; and, if notwith&s;tanding &s;uch proui&s;ion of good a&s;&s;u|rance taken, there &s;hall afterwards any doubt followe, that notwith&s;tanding the &s;aide bonds, the &s;aide Corne &s;halbe caried out of the Realme: the partie that &s;hall haue cau&s;e &s;o to &s;u&s;pect the &s;ame, &s;hall repaire to &s;ome Iu|&s;tice of Peace, whom her Maie&s;tie doth hereby commaund to examine the trueth at the Port, whereunto the &s;aid Corne was appointed. And for that purpo&s;e the officers of that Port &s;hall make plaine declaration, whe|ther any &s;uch Corne, and what quantitie thereof came to that Port within the time limitted. And if by good proofe it &s;hall any wayes appeare, that there hath bene any fraud in any officer of the Port, or fal&s;ehood in the tran&s;porter by carying it out of the Realme, the officer of the Port &s;halbe depriued of his office, and &s;uffer impri|&s;onment, and make fine to her Maie&s;tie at her plea&s;ure. And the tran&s;porter for carying it out of the Realme, and the &s;eller and buyer, or either of them being priuy thereto, &s;hall be committed to pri&s;on for the &s;pace of one yeere, and the Ship forfeited. And the Informer for his labour and reward &s;hall haue both the halfe of the value of the Corne tran&s;ported, and the halfe of the fines impo&s;ed vpon the offenders. And for the trial of the&s;e offences, and execution of the puni&s;hments and fines, the &s;ame &s;halbe tried in her Maie&s;ties Exchequer, as all informations are vpon penall Statutes, where all expedition &s;hall bee v&s;ed, or before the Iu&s;tices of A&s;&s;i&s;e in their circuites, or before any Iu&s;tices of Peace in the Se&s;&s;ions, where the offence &s;hall be committed, hauing any authoritie to heare and determine any penall Lawe.</P>
<P>Finally her Maie&s;tie is particularly informed of &s;ome intentions of &s;undry per&s;ons of abilitie to keepe ho&s;pi|talitie in their Countreys, to leaue their &s;aid ho&s;pitalities, and to come to the Citie of London, and other Ci|ties and townes corporate, thereby leauing the reliefe of their poore neighbours, as well for foode, as for good rule, and with couetous minds to liue in London, and about the Citie priuately, and &s;o al&s;o in other Townes corporate, without charge of company; for with&s;tanding whereof her Maie&s;tie chargeth all maner of per|&s;ons, that &s;hall haue any &s;uch intention during the time of this dearth, not to breake vp their hou&s;holds, nor to come to the &s;aid Citie, or other townes corporate: and all others that haue of late time broken vp their hou&s;|holds, to returne to their hou&s;es againe without delay. And while&s;t her Maie&s;tie had thus determined for reliefe of her people to &s;tay all good hou&s;eholders in their Countreys, there in charitable &s;ort to keepe ho&s;pita|litie, her Maie&s;tie hath had an in&s;tant occa&s;ion giuen her to extend her commandement euen for the nece&s;&s;ary defence of her Realme: willing and &s;traitly commaunding all maner of per&s;ons that be deputies to any Lieu|tenants in any Counties of the Realme, to repaire to their Countreys; And that all per&s;ons hauing charge of any Ca&s;tles or Forts vpon the Sea coa&s;tes, do pre&s;ently repaire to their charge, and there to re&s;ide per&s;onally during all this Winter &s;ea&s;on, and to haue care how the &s;ame Fortes are furni&s;hed, and to make petition for their defects. And likewi&s;e her Maie&s;tie chargeth all per&s;ons dwelling in any Port towne to continue their habitation there, and to furni&s;h their hou&s;eholds with able per&s;ons for defence of the &s;aid Ports. The&s;e her Maie&s;ties pre&s;ent co~mandements her highne&s;&s;e mindeth and willeth to be enquired of by the Lieutenants of euery Shire, and &s;pecially by them of the Maritime Counties, whom her Maie&s;tie chargeth to enquire dili|gently hereof, and by their commandements to &s;ee the defaults reformed, or otherwi&s;e to aduerti&s;e her Ma|ie&s;tie or her priuie Coun&s;ell of the offenders. The ob&s;eruation of all which, her Maie&s;ties commaundement is to be performed vpon paine of her Maie&s;ties heauie indignation.</P>
