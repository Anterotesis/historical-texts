<P>The &s;tates had of late intended to &s;urpri&s;e Graueling: but the practi&s;e being di&s;couered, their men returned without perfour|ming any thing.</P>
<P>The Frenchmen encrea&s;ing &s;till in power make towardes A|miens whereinto there is entred a certaine number of hor&s;e and the &s;aid Frenchmen inuading the country of Luxembrough, did on a &s;odaine &s;urprize the towne of Iunix, which after they had &s;ackt they &s;et on fire, and thence marcht towards Lafertei, where not being able to effect their purpo&s;e, they roue vp and downe the prouince, doing euery where great hurte. For which cau&s;e the Cardinall hath &s;ent thither Colonel Berlotta with other Cap|taines to with&s;tand the French, who &s;eeke by &s;uch attemptes to cro&s;&s;e and hinder his proceedings.</P>
<P>We are aduerti&s;ed here by letters from Holland, of the arri|uall there of &s;undry &s;hips laden with diuers merchandizes, and &s;tore of ready money, who report that the Engli&s;hmen hauing ta|ken and &s;akt the Port of Saint Martin, did afterward &s;et it on fire with all the &s;hippes within the harbour.</P>

<P>The Spani&s;h Agentes heere are aduerti&s;ed by letters from Praghe, that the Admirall of Arragon hath publi&s;hed in that court by order of the Catholike King, that the Lady Infant of Spaine was maried to the Cardinall Archduke, and that the Emperour will re&s;igne the kingdome of Bohemia vnto him, as al&s;o that he &s;halbe made king of Romanes, which is as much to &s;ay as heire and &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the Empire. Otherwi&s;e the Catho|like Maie&s;ty will not giue him any &s;tate le&s;t he &s;hould dimini&s;h the Crowne of Spaine, vnle&s;&s;e perhaps he be&s;tow on him the Dutchy of Brittaine hauing recouered it from the French, as a thing belonging to the Lady Infants mother. That the Cardi|nall &s;hall re&s;igne the Archbi&s;hopricke of Toledo to Archduke Maximilian one of the brethren of the Prince of Spaines bride which &s;halbe. Who (as it is reported) mu&s;t be conueied to her hu&s;band in October next: vpon the publi&s;hing whereof the Em|ba&s;&s;adors of Venice, the great Duke, and Savoy did in their princes names vi&s;ite and gratulate the catholike kings amba&s;|&s;ador.</P>

<P>The other night there were &s;ent from hence two Di&s;pen&s;ati|ons into &s;paine, the one whereby the kings daughter may take to hu&s;band the cardinall, the other that the prince may take to wife her that is betrothed vnto him, who &s;hal this &s;ummer be conueied to Barcellona by the prince Doria in his gally royall with other gallies to the number of 30. whither the &s;aid prince will come to receiue her.</P>
<P>The great duke vnder&s;tanding that the catholike King wan|ted powder and other munition wherewith to furni&s;h his towns on the &s;ea coa&s;t of &s;paine and Portugall, e&s;pecially at this time, becau&s;e he feares they &s;halbe a&s;&s;aulted by the Engli&s;h fleete, his highne&s;&s;e did therefore cau&s;e a &s;hip to be laden with 20000. bar+rels of powder and other munition, which he &s;ent into Spaine for a pre&s;ent to the catholike maie&s;tie: but the Florentines &s;ay that hee &s;ent the &s;aide munition, to haue therefore &s;o much corne graine.

<P>They write from Florence, that the fort of Ca&s;teldit ouer-a|gain&s;t Mar&s;iglia, holdes for the great Dutche&s;&s;e in the French kings name, becau&s;e the &s;aid fort was taken by the &s;ouldiers of the other fortre&s;&s;e belowe which are kept there at the &s;aide great duche&s;&s;e co&s;t, by who&s;e order the amba&s;&s;adour of Tu&s;cane con|ferring with him of France on tue&s;day, told him that what&s;oeuer was done herein, was for the &s;eruice of the mo&s;t chri&s;tian maie|&s;tie, and by the Duke of Gui&s;e his con&s;ent, which, perceiuing that the captaine of the &s;aid place had inteligence with the prince Doria &s;ent po&s;t for him to Mar&s;iglia, that the &s;ouldiers might the more ea&s;ily atchieue their enterpri&s;e.</P>

<P>The Cardinall Archduke doth what hee can to put an armie into the field; but through want of mony his purpo&s;e goes &s;low|ly forward: neither is it yet knowne what enterpri&s;e the Spani|ards will make, &s;ith the troups which were &s;ent forth, are retur|ned vnto their garri&s;ons, which moueth &s;ome to thinke that they will onely &s;trengthen and furni&s;h the frontier-townes.</P>
<P>The forces which his highne&s;&s;e &s;ent to &s;uccour Amiens, haue done nothing, becau&s;e they were not &s;trong enough to with&s;tand the French, who haue entrenched them&s;elues not farre from the army where they remain, keeping good watch, and the Spani&s;h hor&s;emen in Arras appoynted to &s;uccour Amiens, can finde no meanes to enter the towne, &s;ith all the pa&s;&s;ages are &s;topt, and the &s;ouldiers within the towne repo&s;ed &s;mall confidence in the Burge&s;&s;es, who begin to grow weary of perfourming the duetie of &s;ouldiers.</P>
<P>The French men in the countrie of Luxembrough vnder the D. of Niuers do watch their opportunitie to worke, &s;ome &s;poile (and as the voice goeth) they will lay &s;iege to Harlam, not farre from Ba&s;tague, if they be not preuented by colonell Berlotta, whome his highne&s;&s;e hath &s;ent into tho&s;e partes,</P>
