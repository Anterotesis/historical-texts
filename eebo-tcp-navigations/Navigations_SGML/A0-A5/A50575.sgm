<P>Page 2. <HI>THE Trade to the</HI> Ea&s;t Indies <HI>&s;ome few Years pa&s;t did employ fifteen thou&s;and Tuns of Shipping; according to the pre&s;ent times there is and may be employ'd ten thou&s;and Tuns of warlike Shipping, be|&s;ides three thou&s;and Tuns more, now here repairing for the next &s;upply of tho&s;e Voyages.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P><HI>The &s;aid Shipping do employ</HI> 2500 <HI>Mariners, whereof one third part at lea&s;t are &s;hipped from hence Land-men, who are made good Mari|ners by the&s;e Voyages,</HI> page 2.</P>
<P><HI>This Trade, as it is great in it &s;elf, &s;o doth it yet farther enlarge our Traf|fick and Strength, by furni&s;hing this Kingdom with all &s;orts of</HI> Indian <HI>Wares, not only for our own u&s;e, but more e&s;pecially for the nece&s;&s;ary wants of Foreign Nations, which hath much increa&s;ed the number of our Warlike Ships to Export them from hence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For Proof whereof we in&s;tance the la&s;t Year when we brought in Pepper from</HI> Indies <HI>to the value of two hun|dred and eighty thou&s;and Pounds Sterling, whereof one hundred and eighty thou&s;and pounds was within few Weeks &s;hipped off; the like is done with</HI> Indico <HI>and</HI> Callicoes, <HI>and other rich Wares, in&s;omuch that we may boldly affirm, that by the&s;e Exportati|ons
<PB N="5" REF="3">of</HI> India <HI>Commodities for divers Parts, we do employ, going and com|ing, in tho&s;e Voyages, at lea&s;t</HI> 2000 <HI>Tuns of &s;hipping, which do require</HI> 500 <HI>Mariners to Man them.</HI></P>

<P>[Page 8.] <HI>The remote&s;t Traffick is always mo&s;t beneficial to the Pub|lick Stock; the Example may be thus, Suppo&s;e that Pepper were worth here</HI> 2 <HI>s. a pound, if we &s;hould fetch the &s;ame from</HI> Holland, <HI>the Mer|chant may pay</HI> 20 <HI>pence the pound out of the Kingdoms Stock, and gain well by the Bargain; but if he fetch Pepper from the</HI> Ea&s;t-Indies <HI>he can|not give there above</HI> 5 <HI>Pence the Pound at the mo&s;t, which doth &s;uffi|ciently &s;hew the great advantage we have to buy our Wares in tho&s;e re|mote Countries, not only for that part alone which we &s;pend, but e&s;peci|ally for that great quantity which from hence we Tran&s;port yearly in|to other Countries, to be &s;old at high|er Prices than it is worth here in</HI> England; <HI>and a farther Benefit by Sale of our Tin, Cloath, Lead, and
<PB N="7" REF="4">other native Commodities, the Vent whereof doth daily increa&s;e in tho&s;e Countries, which formerly had no u&s;e of our Wares.</HI></P>
<P>[Page 9.] <HI>It is manife&s;t, when we brought</HI> Indico <HI>from</HI> Turkey, <HI>that &s;ort was ordinarily &s;old for</HI> 6 <HI>s. the pound, or more, which now we &s;ell for</HI> 4 <HI>s. Pepper then ordinarily at</HI> 3 <HI>s. and</HI> 4 <HI>d. the pound, which now is &s;old for by the</HI> Ea&s;t India <HI>Com|pany for twenty pence; but for Cloves, they are now worth</HI> 11 <HI>s. the pound, Mace in &s;orts</HI> 10 <HI>s. Nutmegs</HI> 5 <HI>s. the pound, becau&s;e the</HI> Hollanders, <HI>by the expul&s;ion of our People, do keep us by force from the Trade of tho&s;e Spices; in which Wares, when we en|joy'd the freedom of that Trade in the</HI> Indies, <HI>we &s;old Cloves here at</HI> 5 <HI>s.</HI> 6 <HI>d.

<P>Seeing that the great advantage we have to buy our Wares in tho&s;e remote Countries, is e&s;peci|ally for that great quantity which from hence is tran&s;ported into other Countrys to be &s;old at an higher Price than it is worth here, and not for that which is con|&s;umed at home; If then we would make this Trade beneficial as in tho&s;e days, the &s;ame Method mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, which is, <HI>to con&s;ume little at home, and export much.</HI></P>
<P>And a further Benefit did ac|crew by the Sale of our Tin, Cloth and Lead, which then did in|crea&s;e, but now <HI>Silver</HI> is the chief Commodity which they &s;end thi|ther, which is, as it were, the Vitals of the Commonwealth, for as the wi&s;e Man &s;aith, <HI>it an&s;wers all
<PB N="9" REF="5">things:</HI> What a Prejudice is it then for them to &s;end out of the Na|tion that which <HI>an&s;wers all things,</HI> to have in Return that which evident|ly proves the de&s;truction of our <HI>own</HI> Manufactures, and impoveri&s;hing the Nation?</P>

<P>[Page 10.] <HI>The next Quaery con|cerns the Kingdom nearly; for it is no &s;mall work to improve the Price of Lands, which never hath, nor can be done but by the pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s of our. Foreign Trade, the Ballance whereof is the only means and rule of our Trea&s;ure; that is to &s;ay, when either by i&s;&s;uing out of the Realm yearly a greater value in Wares than we con&s;ume in foreign Commodities, we grow rich: Or by &s;pending more of &s;trangers Goods than we &s;ell them of our own, we are impoveri&s;hed: For the first of the&s;e cour&s;es doth bring in the Money that we have,
<PB N="10" REF="6">the la&s;t will carry it away again when we have got it; if we exceed our means by exce&s;s in Foreign Wares, or maintain a War by Sea or Land, where we do not feed and clothe the Souldiers, and &s;upply the Armies with our native Provi&s;ions, by which di&s;orders our Trea&s;ure will &s;oon be exhausted.</HI></P>
<P>[Page 13.] <HI>The bu&s;ine&s;s then is briefly thus, that as the Trea&s;ure which is brought into the Realm by the ballance of our Foreign Trade, is, that Money which only doth abide with us, and by which we are in|richt; &s;o by this plenty of Money thus gotten (and no otherwi&s;e) do our Lands improve; for when the Merchant has a good Di&s;patch be|yond the Seas for his Cloth, and others our native Wares, he doth pre&s;ently return to buy greater quan|tity, which rai&s;eth the price of</HI> Wooll <HI>and other Commodities, which doth
<PB N="11" REF="6">improve the Landlords Rents as the Lea&s;es expire.</HI></P>

<P>If it concerns the Kingdom near|ly, and that it is no &s;mall work to improve the Price of our Lands, and that it cannot be done but by the pro&s;perous Succe&s;s of our Foreign Trade, and that the Bal|lance is the only Means and Rule of our Trea&s;ure, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It concerns the Kingdom highly to keep the Ballance on the Kingdoms &s;ide, e&s;|pecially in this Trade, which is &s;o great; for the greater the Trade is, the greater the Mi&s;chief, when the Ballance is on the other &s;ide, as it is now in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, and has been &s;o for many Years; For when the Ballance is on the Kingdoms &s;ide it brings in Trea&s;ure, and improves the price of our Lands, and when the Bal|lance
<PB N="12" REF="7">is on the other &s;ide it has the contrary effect.</P>
<P>By this Argument it is plain, that the Landed-Men will &s;uffer by this Trade, as well as the Manufactu|rers, tho not &s;o &s;oon; but as in Common Prudence, when ones Neighbour's Hou&s;e is on Fire, all Endeavours are u&s;ed by the Neigh|bourhood to quench it, not only for their Neighbour's good, but al&s;o to pre&s;erve them&s;elves; &s;o that it is the Intere&s;t of Landed-Men, as well as Manufacturers, to en|deavour to put a &s;top to the evil in that Trade, and to turn the Scales on the Kingdoms &s;ide, ac|cording to the Principles of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company when they made this <HI>Remon&s;trance,</HI> which was to make our Exportation great, of all &s;orts of Commodi|ries, and the home-Con&s;umption little of Foreign.</P>

<HEAD>Remon&s;trance.</HEAD>
<P>[Page 14.] <HI>In the cour&s;e of Fo|reign Trade there be three &s;orts or degrees of Gain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Fir&s;t is that of the Common|wealth, which may be done when the Merchant, who is the principal agent therein, &s;hall lo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Second is, the Gain of the Merchant, which he doth &s;ometimes ju&s;tly, and worthily effect, altho the Commonwealth be a lo&s;er.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Third is, the Gain of the King, whereof he is ever certain, even when the Commonwealth and the Merchant &s;hall be both lo&s;ers.</HI></P>
<P>[Page 15.] <HI>Suppo&s;e the Company &s;hould &s;end out</HI> one hundred thou|&s;and pounds <HI>in Wares or Money, into</HI> India, <HI>and receive home for the &s;ame</HI> three hundred thou&s;and pounds, <HI>it is evident that this part
<PB N="14" REF="8">of the Publick Stock is tribled, and yet we may boldly &s;ay the Company lo&s;eth, if the Return be in Bulky Com|modities, as</HI> Saltpetre, Cotton-Yarn, Indico, Callicoe, &amp;c. <HI>the Cu&s;toms and Charges will amount to</HI> two hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>[Page 16.] <HI>A Second &s;ort of Gain in the cour&s;e of Trade is, when the Merchant by his laudable endeavours, may both bring in and carry out Wares to his advantage, by buying and &s;elling them to good Profit, which is the end of his labour, yet never|thele&s;s the Commonwealth &s;hall de|cline and grow poor, by a di&s;order in the People, when through Pride, and Exce&s;&s;es, they do con&s;ume more Foreign Wares in value than the Wealth of the Kingdom can &s;atisfie and pay by the Exportatian of our own Commodities, which is the very quality of a Spendthrift who &s;pends beyonds his Means.</HI></P>
<PB N="15" REF="8">
<P><HI>The Third Gain is the King's, who is ever &s;ure to get by Trade, when both the Commonwealth and Merchant &s;hall loo&s;e &s;everally or jointly, as it may and doth &s;ome|times happen when the Merchants Succe&s;s is bad; and our Commodi|ties are over-ballanced by Foreign Wares con&s;umed; but if &s;uch di&s;or|ders be not prevented, His Maje|&s;ty, in the end, &s;hall be the greater lo&s;er, when His Subjects &s;hall be im|poveri&s;hed.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Animadvertion.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e Three &s;orts of Gain can|not long continue, or at lea&s;t ought not; for as to the fir&s;t, if the Commonwealth gains and the Mer|chant lo&s;eth, the Merchant will take care to put a &s;top to that Trade, by leaving it, for &s;elf-pre|&s;ervation &s;ake.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="9">
<P>As to the Second, When the Commonwealth loo&s;eth, there is the greate&s;t Mi&s;chief, and like&s;t to continue, becau&s;e the Merchant, who is the Agent is the Gainer, and the Commonwealth which is the loo&s;er, is pa&s;&s;ive, and cannot &s;o &s;oon hinder the Mi&s;chief growing upon it as could be wi&s;h'd; becau&s;e it mu&s;t be done by hole&s;ome Laws (which requires time) to repair the Breach made by the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h Traders, and to keep Trade in its true Cour&s;e, that the Commonwealth may be no loo&s;er, which is highly rea&s;onable to be done, it being no more than the prudent Trader doth of him&s;elf, when he finds he's a loo&s;er, he leaves it, and follows a|nother.</P>
<P>As to the Third &s;ort of Gain, its &s;ure&s;t and la&s;ting foundation mu&s;t be that which brings Gain to all: In Mu&s;ick, when all parts agree,
<PB N="17" REF="9">there is a &s;weet Melody, but if not, then Jars and Di&s;cord.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Remon&s;trance.</HEAD>
<P><HI>We will take that for granted which no body will deny us, that we have no other means to get Trea&s;ure but by Foreign Trade, for Mines we have none which do afford it; and how this Money is gotten in the manag|ing of the &s;aid Trade, we have al|ready &s;hew'd, That it is done by mak|ing our Commodities which are ex|ported to over-ballance in Value the Foreign Wares which we con&s;ume.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Animadvertion.</HEAD>
<P>If we have no other Means to get Trea&s;ure but by Foreign Trade, and that it mu&s;t be done by making our Commodities which are ex|ported,
<PB N="18" REF="10">to exceed in value the Fo|reign Wares which we con&s;ume: So that if upon Examination of the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade, as it is now managed, it &s;hall appear, that we con&s;ume more of the&s;e Foreign Wares than is exported of our own, (which is the quality of a Spend|thrift, who &s;pends beyond his Means) the Manager thereof ought to be brought to their Primitive Principles, and grant the reque&s;t the <HI>Company</HI> then made to the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> in the Prayer of their Pe|tition, which was, <HI>That if it was not a beneficial Trade to the Nation, it might be &s;uppre&s;s'd.</HI></P>
<P>So that it doth appear by what has been &s;aid, That the <HI>Ea&s;t-India Company</HI> in its Primitive Time, did &s;hew, <HI>That the Benefit of this Trade did con&s;i&s;t only in its greater Expor|tation in value of our own Wares than in the con&s;umption of Foreign.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="10">
<P>Now that the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Traders do export le&s;s in value of our Wares than is con&s;um'd here of theirs, is obvious to all that know any thing of that Trade, and was plainly made to appear before the la&s;t Parliament, when the <HI>Commons</HI> pa&s;&s;ed a Bill for the <HI>re&s;training the con&s;umption of part of tho&s;e</HI> India <HI>Wares,</HI> and the <HI>Lords</HI> thought there was too little re&s;train|ed, as appears by the Amendments made by their Lord&s;hips to the &s;aid Bill.</P>
<P>There is another Mi&s;chief that doth attend this Trade, and that is the great Number of our People that are di&s;abled of following their Trades, and are become a wandring People, &s;ome about the Streets for Relief, &s;ome to Sea, and &s;ome to other Countries to &s;eek their For|tunes: For it is evident, that by &s;o much as is con&s;umed of the&s;e Fo|reign Wares, by &s;o much our own
<PB N="20" REF="11">are le&s;&s;ened, and con&s;equently the Manufacturers are brought into great Streights: What a Reproach would it be to this Nation, to &s;ee great Numbers reduced to Begga|ry, or to leave their Native Coun|try, to &s;atisfie the Luxury of &s;ome that act as if they were made only for them&s;elves?</P>
<P>I well remember the Saying of &s;ome Strangers formerly, who &s;aid, <HI>That if a Man could not get a Livelihood in</HI> England, <HI>he could get it no where,</HI> &s;o fully employ'd were our Manufactures in tho&s;e Days; but now quite contrary, becau&s;e of the va&s;t Importation and Con&s;umption of tho&s;e Fo|reign Wrought Silks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but e&s;|pecially tho&s;e from <HI>China,</HI> which has been Imported but of late Years in &s;uch great Quantities, in|&s;omuch that they have thereby &s;o clogg'd the Market, that a very
<PB N="21" REF="11">great quantity have remain'd un|&s;old at the Companies la&s;t Sale; and by con&s;equence, there can be no Trade for the <HI>Weavers</HI> while the <HI>Companies</HI> Magazines are &s;tored, becau&s;e they cannot work at &s;uch Rates as in <HI>India,</HI> where they can live for One Penny a day.</P>
<P>This Mi&s;chief will not only fall upon the Silk Manufacture, but our own Staple Manufacture of Wooll, which the Farmers that have Wooll on their hands feel, and is not like to end there, but mu&s;t needs fall heavy upon Landlords, and a Multitude of Poor that are, and may be employ'd in that Manufacture.</P>
<P>The Silk manufactured in <HI>Eng|land</HI> is generally the Returns of our Woollen from <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> but more e&s;pecially from <HI>Turkey,</HI> from whence we have Raw-Silk,
<PB N="22" REF="12">Grogram-Yarn, and Dy-Stuff, by which are employ'd not only great number of Weavers and Dyers, but al&s;o many Throw&s;ters, who, as well as the Weavers, employ Men, Women and Children, from the Age of Six Years and up|wards; &s;o that a Child from Six Years to Eleven, can get from eigh|teen Pence to Three Shillings a Week; Be&s;ides many Thou&s;ands of Seamens Wives, who are us'd to get a Livelihood in Winding of Silk at Home, whil&s;t their Husbands are abroad at Sea, and &s;o main|tain their Families; whereas other|wi&s;e they mu&s;t go upon Tick, or beg, or borrow, until their Hu&s;|bands return; and then his Pay mu&s;t go to quit Scores, and have nothing left for their other Nece&s;&s;a|ries.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Turkey</HI> Merchant finds no Vend for his Silk and Yarn,
<PB N="23" REF="12">which is the Returns for his Cloths, he will &s;end no more, and then the Clothier feels the &s;mart, and when he cannot &s;ell his Cloth he'll buy no Wooll, and then the Far|mer feels it, and when the Farmer cannot turn his Wooll into Mo|ney he cannot pay his Rent, and then the Landlord has his feeling-part with the re&s;t: So as in the natural Body, when one Member is wounded, it affects the whole Bo|dy, &s;o in the Body Politique, when the manufacturing part (which is &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part) is wounded, it mu&s;t needs affect the whole Body the more.</P>
<P>But &s;ome will &s;ay, <HI>Trade mu&s;t be free, and not di&s;turb'd:</HI> We grant it, and &s;o it mu&s;t &s;o long as it is kept in its right Channel: What can be more free than the Sea and the Rivers, whom none can con|troul, yet the Creator has &s;et bounds
<PB N="24" REF="13">to the proud Ocean, &s;aying, <HI>&s;o far &s;halt thou go, and no farther;</HI> yet it is &s;till free in its Cour&s;e; &s;o like|wi&s;e, the People of <HI>England, tho' they have Laws to govern them, which are the Boundaries of a People, yet not|with&s;tanding they are a Free People;</HI> So we may &s;ay of Trade, that it is never the le&s;s free for its being kept in its right cour&s;e by hole&s;ome Laws, than the Sea is by the Shore, or the River by its Banks; for tho&s;e things may be &s;aid to be free, that are not interrupted in their true cour&s;e for which they were made: Now it is manife&s;t that Trade was made for the Good of Mankind, and Benefit of the Publick, and &s;o far as it con|duceth to tho&s;e ends, it ought to be free and uncontroul'd; but as Trade cannot be carried on of it &s;elf, but by &s;ome Agent, which is Mankind, who for the generality are bya&s;s'd, and more &s;elfi&s;h than Publick Spirited, and &s;o turns its Cour&s;e out of the
<PB N="25" REF="13">right Channel; like a Flood of Wa|ters that overflows or breaks its Banks, and brings a Deluge of Mi|&s;eries with it, whil&s;t they fill their Coffers in fi&s;hing in troubled Wa|ters.</P>
<P>So as the Sea and the Rivers are bounded that they may be kept in their free cour&s;e for the benefit of the re&s;t of the Creation: Even &s;o ought there to be Bounds to Trade, that it may be kept in the true and free cour&s;e for which it was made.</P>
