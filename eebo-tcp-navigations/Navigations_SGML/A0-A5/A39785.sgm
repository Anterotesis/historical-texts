<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am &s;o far from wondring at the extraordinary Concern which you are plea&s;ed to expre&s;s for the late bad News of our Colo|ny's having come away from &s;o Valuable and Impregnable a Settlement, as that of which they were Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, in the very Na|vel of the Trading World (if I may properly &s;o call it) that I &s;hould much more Wonder, if any Man who carries <HI>Scots</HI>&punc;Blood in his Veins, and pretends to have any regard either for the Honour, Intere&s;t, or Reputation of his Countrey, &s;hould not, upon &s;o provoking an Oc|ca&s;ion, contribute as much as in him lies, to retrieve &s;o great a Lo&s;s at any Rate, and have a ju&s;t Re&s;entment again&s;t the Authors of &s;o Surpri&s;ing and Unaccountable an Emergency.</P>
<P>You tell me (which is true) that &s;everal People, according to their different Intere&s;ts and Affections, as well as different Capaci|ties to Penetrate into, and judge of, the true Grounds of &s;o un|expected an Emergency, do vent their Opinions and Reflections variou&s;ly concerning it: Some attributing it to the want of due Care in the Directors at home, to &s;end Intelligence, as well as the needful Supplies of Men and Provi&s;ions to the Colony, in due time; &s;ome to the Temerity, Imprudence and Incapacity, of tho&s;e who were intru&s;ted abroad, with the Management and Government of the Colony; &s;ome (who you &s;ay are the far greater Number) to the effect of His Maje&s;ty's Proclamations i&s;&s;ued forth in all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations of <HI>America,</HI> declaring the &s;aid Settlement ille|gal, and &s;trictly intercomuning all Per&s;ons thereunto belonging; And you are plea&s;ed to de&s;ire my Sentiments of the whole Matter.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be reckon'd no &s;mall piece of Pre&s;umption in one of my weak Talent, to venture upon &s;etting Pen to Paper, upon &s;o Criti|cal an Occa&s;ion as this is; and how willing &s;oever I might have been at any other time to gratify your Reque&s;t that way, I mu&s;t Confe&s;s, I am in &s;o Splenetick a Mood, at this Juncture, that my Inclinations prompt me but very little to be&s;tow my Time upon Scribbling:
<PB N="4" REF="3">
Yet your Commands being always Indi&s;puteable with me, I &s;hall &s;upercede my own Inclinations at this time, and freely give you my Thoughts of the Matter, with all imaginable Candour, as &s;uc|cinctly as I can, and commit the whole to your own Di&s;cretion, being well a&s;&s;ur'd that you'l Advi&s;e nothing thereupon, but what you are fully convinc'd will be mo&s;t Suteable to the Honour, Inte|re&s;t, and Reputation of the Nation, which (by the by) was, in my humble Opinion, never at a lower Ebb than at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>That the Directors of our <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>African</HI> Company at home, are no manner of way Chargeable with any Omi&s;&s;ion or want of due Care in making early Provi&s;ions for Supplies to the Colony, or with any Mi&s;-managements in taking wrong Mea&s;ures, upon &s;ome Occa&s;ion or other, or with too much Ea&s;ine&s;s and Credulity (as &s;ome do alledge) in &s;uffering them&s;elves to be Over-per&s;waded, or any otherways impo&s;ed upon by mercenary Pretenders, who at the &s;ame time might po&s;&s;ibly have been the Tools for driving on a For|reign Intere&s;t, for &s;elfi&s;h Ends, is more than I &s;hall take upon me to maintain too po&s;itively in their behalf: But &s;ure I am, the many Di&s;-appointments, Difficulties and wicked Contrivances, which they were all along oblig'd to grapple with, both Abroad and at Home, made their Part very unea&s;ie, and were enough to daunt the Re&s;o|lutions of any privat Society what&s;oever; e&s;pecially finding them|&s;elves &s;o openly di&s;countenanc'd by Authority, that the Adventu|rers were thereby di&s;courag'd from paying in their Shares; yea in &s;o much that the Directors were not only &s;heckled from pur&s;uing many rea&s;onable and convenient Mea&s;ures that they had in View, but were al&s;o often oblig'd to pawn their own privat Credit for carry|ing on, and doing tho&s;e things that were indi&s;pen&s;ibly nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upporting the common Intere&s;t, and wait for their Relief till a bet|ter Opportunity &s;hould offer.</P>
<P>But whatever E&s;capes they may be chargeable with, I dare con|fidently averr in their behalf, that they have Directed to the be&s;t of their Knowledge; and I doubt very much, whether the mo&s;t part of
<PB N="5" REF="3">
all tho&s;e, who ever yet took the Liberty of Cen&s;uring their Actions, would have taken half &s;o Rational Mea&s;ures, had they had the &s;ame Game to play, and the &s;ame Difficulties to encounter with: For, as the Directors were Cho&s;en by the Solemn Election and Suffrage of all the Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of the Company, (wherein the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Nobility, Gentry, and whole Body of the Royal Burrows are concerned) &s;o it mu&s;t be allowed, that the Generality of tho&s;e in the Direction, are Per&s;ons of as much known Honour, Probity and Integrity, and of as much Knowledge too, as can be found of any other Set of Men in the Nation: But the conti|nued Thwartings that they met with from time to time, did not on|ly nece&s;&s;arly retard many of their Mea&s;ures, but made al&s;o &s;ome of tho&s;e Mea&s;ures prove altogether Abortive, tho', never &s;o rationally projected: And it's very ob&s;ervable, that none have been more bu|&s;ie and meddling in Cen&s;uring their Conduct all along, and even at this time, than &s;ome who had little or no Concern in the Stock, and others who were ready upon all Occa&s;ions to throw Stumbling Blocks in their Way. But 'tis very ea&s;y, and no new Thing, to ei|ther Credulous Fools, or De&s;igning Knaves, (who, alas! are by far, the greate&s;t part of Mankind) to Cen&s;ure the be&s;t of Mens Acti|ons, without ever con&s;idering the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Mea&s;ures they take, or the Cro&s;sne&s;s of any Accidents they may meet with. And this brings into my Remembrance a Saying of the Renowned Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in his Apology for his Voyage to <HI>Guiana: As good Succe&s;s admits no Examination, &s;o the contrary allows of no Excu&s;e, how rea&s;onable or ju&s;t &s;oever.</HI> And indeed the Poet is very ju&s;t upon that Head:
<Q><L>&mdash;Careat &s;ucce&s;&s;ibus opto</L>
<L>Qui&s;quis ab eventu facta notanda putat. <BIBL>Ovid. <HI>Epi&s;t.</HI> 3.</BIBL></L></Q></P>
<P>It is very evident by the Strain of the Acts of Parliament and Let|ters Patent, e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;aid Company, that the&s;e who projected that Scheme had in View, &s;ooner or later, no le&s;s De&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">gn than a Trade to both the <HI>Indies</HI> and to <HI>Africa,</HI> and that by a more imme|diat
<PB N="6" REF="4">
and much quicker Communication than was ever before practi|&s;ed by any Society what&s;oever.</P>
<P>In order whereunto, tho&s;e in the Management thought it was not only nece&s;&s;ary, to e&s;tabli&s;h a Free and Staple-Port in &s;ome convenient Place or Places on that <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> or Nick of Land, &s;ituated on the Height of the World, between the North and South Seas, formerly called <HI>Darien,</HI> or in &s;ome &s;uch convenient Place, but al&s;o to rai&s;e a Joynt-Stock &s;uteable to the Greatne&s;s of &s;uch an Undertaking.</P>
<P>And not imagining that privat Hands in this Kingdom could of them&s;elves be able to rai&s;e a &s;ufficient Stock for that Purpo&s;e, the fir&s;t Offer thereof was made to our Friends at <HI>London,</HI> who in nine days time concluded a Sub&s;cription there, of 300000 Pounds <HI>Ster|ling,</HI> and paid in the fir&s;t fourth Part thereof either in Money, Bank-Bills, or Notes payable on Demand, and further declared their Wil|lingne&s;s to Sub&s;cribe for as much more, if allowed: But you know how that Sub&s;cription was quickly render'd void by the Mea&s;ures taken in the Parliament of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next Attempt (you know) that the Directors made for &s;trengthning their Stock and Intere&s;t, was to endeavour the procu|ring of Forreign Sub&s;criptions for &s;ome con&s;iderable Sum; And in Order thereunto, upon repeated encouraging Advices from &s;everal Parts beyond Sea, but more e&s;pecially from <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> they &s;ent &s;ome of their own Number, as Commi&s;&s;ioners or Deputees thither, with whom &s;oon after their Arrival, the Merchants of the &s;aid City of <HI>Hamburgh,</HI> enter'd into Contract to joyn at lea&s;t 200000 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> with the Company's Stock: But you know likewi&s;e, how the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mini&s;ters there, did, under Pretence of a &s;pecial War|rant from His Maje&s;ty, put a Stop thereunto, by giving in a Memo|rial to the Senat of that City, <HI>Not only, di&s;owning the Authority of the &s;aid Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, but al&s;o threatning both Se|nat and Inhabitants with the Kings outmo&s;t Di&s;plea&s;ure, if they &s;hould countenance or joyn with the Company's &s;aid Deputees, in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="4">
Notwith&s;tanding whereof, tho' the <HI>Council-General</HI> and <HI>Court of Directors</HI> of the &s;aid Company have, not only often Addre&s;s'd and Petition'd the King and Privy Council of this Kingdom, but al&s;o His Maje&s;ty's High Commi&s;&s;ioner, and the Right Honourable E&s;tates of Parliament at their la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion; And likewi&s;e, that the &s;aid E&s;tates were thereupon plea&s;ed, by their Unanimous Addre&s;s of the 5th. of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1698 to His Maje&s;ty, <HI>To manife&s;t not only their own, and the whole Nation's Concern in that Matter, earne&s;tly entreating, and mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly expecting, that His Maje&s;ty would, in His Royal Wi&s;dom, take &s;uch Mea&s;ures as might effectually vindicat the Undoubted Rights and Privileges of the &s;aid Company, and &s;upport the Credit and Intere&s;t thereof;</HI> But were al&s;o plea&s;ed in the &s;ame Addre&s;s, <HI>To recommend the Concerns of the &s;aid Company to &s;ome &s;pecial Marks of His Maje&s;ty's Roy|al Favour, as being that Branch of the Trade of this Kingdom, in which They and the Nation they repre&s;ent, have a more peculiar Intere&s;t.</HI> Yet (it &s;eems) His Maje&s;ty has been all along &s;o taken up with the far greater and more general Concerns of <HI>Europe,</HI> that, to this Hour, I have not heard of any manner of Redre&s;s that has been given in that Matter.</P>
<P>There were likewi&s;e con&s;iderable Steps and Advances made by &s;everal Merchants in <HI>Holland,</HI> particularly at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> and <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> towards a Sub&s;cription there; But upon notice had of their Meetings with the Company's Deputees above-mention'd, and of the Succe&s;s their Negotiations were like to have had, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and Leading Men of tho&s;e Merchants, who had &s;hewed mo&s;t Forward|ne&s;s in that Matter, were &s;ent for by &s;ome of the States, and threat|ned <HI>that Mea&s;ures would be taken, to make them repent their Doings, if they per&s;i&s;ted any further in Treating with the &s;aid Deputees, or if they would joyn with the</HI> Scots <HI>Company.</HI></P>
<P>This, I remember, happen'd &s;ome Months before the <HI>Hamburgh-Me|morial</HI> above-mention'd was pre&s;ented, which I confe&s;s makes it &s;eem a Problem to me, as well as to many others that have heard of it, <HI>Whe|ther the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>were influenc'd by the</HI> Dutch, <HI>or the</HI> Dutch <HI>by the</HI> En|gli&s;h,

<HI>to deal &s;o unkindly by us:</HI> But in &s;hort I think we may truly &s;ay with the Prophet, <HI>The</HI> Syrians <HI>before, and the</HI> Phili&s;tines <HI>behind,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> 9. 12.</P>
<P>But to pa&s;s over all the&s;e previous Di&s;couragements and Di&s;appoint|ments, and to come clo&s;ely to the Point in Hand, The Colony that was fir&s;t &s;ent away in <HI>July</HI> 1698, for &s;ettling a Plantation in <HI>Ameri|ca,</HI> pur&s;uant to the In&s;tructions then given, carried along with them not only abundance of all Nece&s;&s;aries for &s;uch an Undertaking&punc; but al&s;o &s;uch a Quantity of Provi&s;ions, as was calculated for a whole Year, and of &s;ome Particulars (namely Stock-Fi&s;h) what was com|puted might have &s;erved for near 18 Months: And for their further Security, in ca&s;e tho&s;e Provi&s;ions &s;hould happen to fall &s;hort, before Advice could be had of their Settlement, and the fre&s;h Supplies of Provi&s;ions &s;ent after them, there was likewi&s;e a Cargo of Sortable Goods, to the Value of about 16000 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> prime Co&s;t here, &s;ent along with them, at the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al of the Council, for the Colony's U&s;e; which Goods were either to be Traded with upon the Coa&s;t and <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, or Barter'd for Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries at the Council's Di&s;cretion, as &s;hould be&s;t &s;ute with their Circum&s;tances for the time. Yet &s;uch was the Directors Care of their Welfare and Safety, That, immediatly after their Departure from <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Directors did, upon the Encouragement of the Parliaments Addre&s;s above-recited, apply them&s;elves in a dutiful manner to His Maje&s;ty, by their humble Petition of the 16th. of <HI>Au|gu&s;t</HI> 1698, <HI>To be&s;tow upon them, as a Gracious Mark of His Royal Favour, the U&s;e of the two &s;mall Friggots. then</HI> (and to this Hour) <HI>lying u&s;ele&s;s in</HI> Burnti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">land <HI>Harbour;</HI> with De&s;ign to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">it them out, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, with Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Co|lony; and appointed a particular Committee to wait upon the Chief-Men in the Government, to de&s;ire their A&s;&s;i&s;tance in Seconding the &s;aid Petition: But in a &s;hort time thereafter, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to call a Council-General of the Company, which accordingly met on the 5th. day of <HI>September</HI> following: And the Directors laying
<PB N="9" REF="5">
before them a Repre&s;entation in Writing (which contained an Ab|&s;tract of the then State of the Company's Affairs, together al&s;o with their own Opinion, what they thought nece&s;&s;ary to be done by the Company at that Juncture, with relation to a Supply of Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries to be &s;ent to the Company's Colony) they thereupon ordered a further Proportion of the Company's Joint-Stock to be call'd in, from the re&s;pective Proprietors for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>And upon the 9<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>November,</HI> The <HI>Court of Directors</HI> did, upon the Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Martinma&s;s</HI> Payments, come to a Re&s;oluti|on, that a Ship of near about 200 Tuns burden, &s;hould be bought forthwith for the Company's U&s;e, and that the buying and fit|ting thereof, as al&s;o the buying of the needful Provi&s;ions for a Sup|ply to the Colony, &s;hould be referred to a Committee which was appointed for that End; but after enquiry made in &s;everal Places a|bout &s;uch a Ve&s;&s;el, they could find none reported to be &s;o fit for their Purpo&s;e, as one that lay then in <HI>Leith-Harbour,</HI> expo&s;ed to Sale; which one of their Number bought, with a &s;pecial Condition to be free, if upon Survey &s;he &s;hould not be &s;ound fit for the Company's U&s;e: And upon the 14<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>December</HI> (which was near about four Months before any Word came from the Colony) the Court of Directors gave Orders to conclude the Bargain for the &s;aid Ship, ac|cording to former Agreement, and to fit her out with Provi&s;ions for the Colony, with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition: But the Ship when bought (tho' a known prime Sailer, and after all the nece&s;&s;ary Pre|caution had in buying of her) happening not to be &s;o Sound as was expected, took a much longer time to be Repaired, than could well have been imagined, and could not therefore Sail as &s;oon as was in|tended.</P>
<P>But in the mean time, the Directors being loath (it &s;eems) to Tru&s;t to the &s;aid Ship only, in ca&s;e of Accidents, made it their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s to find out, and purcha&s;e a good Sailing Ship, <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-qualified, to be di&s;patched from <HI>Clyde</HI> with Provi&s;ions, and the needful Advices for the &s;aid Colony: And upon finding a Ship &s;o qualified, &s;he was
<PB N="10" REF="6">
di&s;patched from <HI>Clyde</HI> upon the 24 of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t; but to the Com|pany's and Colony's ine&s;timable Lo&s;s, the &s;aid Ve&s;&s;el was ca&s;t away on one of the We&s;t I&s;lands of <HI>Scotland:</HI> Of which Accident the <HI>Court of Directors</HI> had no Advice before the 11th. Day of <HI>April:</HI> And the Lo&s;s was &s;till the greater in this, that &s;he was bought &s;o qualified, with a View to be &s;erviceable to the Colony, not only in Trading upon the Coa&s;t, but al&s;o in running backward and forward, to and from any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, with Goods, Provi&s;ions, and Intelligence; &s;he being qualified to touch there in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Act of Navigation.</P>
<P>You may remember likewi&s;e, that the other Ship abovemention'd was ju&s;t ready to Sail about the latter-end of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, being the time that the fir&s;t Advices arrived here of the <HI>Colony</HI>'s Settlement and good Condition: But the Directors having Intelligence of Three <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ships of Force, that were to Sail about that time from <HI>Cadiz</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> with a Re-inforcement of Men, Arms and Am|munition, for <HI>Carthagena,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Don Piementel,</HI> the pre&s;ent Governour of that City, and that he had particular In|&s;tructions, with relation to our Settlement; they thought it not &s;afe to let the Company's &s;aid Ship &s;ail alone; and therefore &s;topt her, till another Ship of Force might be got ready with Men and Provi|&s;ions; which accordingly being got, both the &s;aid Ships &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Leith-Road,</HI> on the 12th. of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, with a Recruit of 300 Men, about 900 Bolls of Wheat made into Bisket and Flower, as al&s;o a con&s;iderable Quantity of Pea&s;e, Pork, Oyl, Brandy, &s;ome Beef, Arms, Ammunition, and other Nece&s;&s;aries; carrying likewi&s;e along with them Advices, that a much more con&s;iderable Recruit of Ships, Men, Provi&s;ions, Arms, Ammunition and other Nece&s;&s;aries, were to follow with all convenient Di&s;patch, under Convoy of the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun.</HI></P>
<P>And the Directors did accordingly di&s;patch the <HI>Ri&s;ing-Sun,</HI> and three other Ships of con&s;iderable Force and Burthen, from <HI>Greenock,</HI> the 18<HI>th.</HI> Day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t; tho' by contrary Winds they were &s;topt,
<PB N="11" REF="6">
&s;o as that they could not &s;ail further than the I&s;le of <HI>Bute,</HI> till the 24<HI>th</HI> of <HI>September</HI> following: They had 1300 Men on board, with as ma|ny Ingineers, Fire-Workers, Bombardeers, Battering Guns, Mor|tars, Bombs, and other Warlike Provi&s;ions, as (if &s;afely arrived at the Colony in due time, and con&s;idering the Situation and natural Strength of the Place) might rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed to have made it impregnable.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, for immediatly after the fir&s;t Advice that the Di|rectors had of the Colony's Settlement, they wrote back to the Co|lony, by the &s;everal Ways of <HI>New-England, Jamaica, Barbados, An|tegoa,</HI> and the other <HI>Leeward I&s;lands,</HI> that the&s;e Recruits above-men|tioned were coming to them; and in the mean time, &s;ent them an Illimited and Di&s;cretionary Credit, for buying of Provi&s;ions from any of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, if they &s;hould happen to &s;tand in need thereof; Which Credit the Directors were induced to give, from an A&s;&s;urance that they had given them, by &s;everal Per&s;ons at <HI>London,</HI> and in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> of their good Inclinations to Supply the Colony with Provi&s;ions, if &s;uch a Credit were given; and for that end, Printed Copies of the &s;aid Credit were &s;ent by the Way of <HI>London,</HI> to be di&s;per&s;ed over all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations in <HI>America.</HI> And upon the Faith thereof, &s;everal Sloops and Brigantins, freighted full of Provi&s;ions, were di&s;patched from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations to our Colony; particularly from <HI>New-England, New-York, Road-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia;</HI> tho', alas! they happen'd to be too late, tho&s;e of the Colony being unluckily come away from <HI>Darien,</HI> &s;ome Weeks, before the&s;e Sloops could well be arrived there: So that this was no &s;uch Imaginary Credit, as &s;ome People would have us be|lieve it to have been. Yea further, even before the &s;aid Credit was known in <HI>America,</HI> not only &s;everal Sloops went with Provi&s;ions from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the Colony, and Barter'd their Provi&s;ions for other Goods: But al&s;o, a <HI>New-England</HI> Brigantin, freighted full of Provi|&s;ions, &s;old her Cargo to the Council of the Colony, for Bills drawn by them upon the Company's Ca&s;hier here; Which Bills amounted
<PB N="12" REF="7">
to about 700 Pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI> and were punctually paid according|ly. By which it may evidently appear, that if no extraordinary Methods had been u&s;ed to put a Barr to their begun Corre&s;pondence, there had been little or no Occa&s;ion for any &s;pecial Credit on parti|cular Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And upon the Directors having received the &s;aid &s;urprizing and unexpected News of their Colony's coming away from <HI>Darien,</HI> they immediatly came to Re&s;olutions of di&s;patching a particular Credit, with proper Advices, <HI>per</HI> Expre&s;s to <HI>New-York,</HI> by a Ve&s;&s;el then bound thither, where they under&s;tood mo&s;t of their Men were, and to &s;end other Expre&s;&s;es, by &s;everal Ways, in que&s;t of both the fir&s;t and la&s;t Recruits &s;ent to the Colony; with Orders to repo&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of their former Settlement, and to fend Supplies of Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries after them, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; and to have from hence forward &s;ome &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els or Advice-Boats, running conti|nually, backward and forward, with certain Intelligence, between this and the Colony, their former way of Corre&s;ponding having (it &s;eems) fail'd by rea&s;on of the Proclamations above-mention'd; as &s;hall appear, more particularly, by and by.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the Expediting of tho&s;e &s;everal Expre&s;&s;es, and &s;en|ding a Credit for Provi&s;ions, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, could not ad|mit of any Delay, at &s;o Critical a Juncture, they frankly engag'd their own privat Credits, for tho&s;e &s;everal Purpo&s;es, until the Com|pany's own Money &s;hould come in to An&s;wer the &s;ame; and in the mean time, they called a Meeting of the Council-General, who approved of tho&s;e Re&s;olutions: And &s;everal of the Councellours did likewi&s;e freely and generou&s;ly joyn their own privat Credits with that of the Directors, for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>In Pur&s;uance of which Re&s;olutions, the Directors &s;ent a Credit of 2000 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> to <HI>New-York</HI> by a Gentleman, whom they &s;ent Expre&s;s from hence thither, in the beginning of <HI>October</HI> la&s;t, with proper In&s;tructions &s;uteable to the Occa&s;ion.</P>

They &s;ent likewi&s;e at the &s;ame time, by a Ship then bound from the <HI>Downs</HI> to the <HI>Leeward I&s;lands,</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ew Councellour for the Colony, fully in&s;tructed in relation to this Emergency, with Orders to go with all po&s;&s;ible Di&s;patch, in que&s;t of the Recruits lately &s;ent to the Colony: And the better to enable him to execute effectually what was then given him in Commi&s;&s;ion, he carried a Credit of 1000 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> along with him.

<P>Now this, being a &s;hort Abridgment of what I under&s;tand, may be offered in Ju&s;tification of the Directors Care and Conduct: I &s;hall now proceed to give you a &s;hort View of what occurs to me at pre&s;ent, with relation to the Conduct of tho&s;e, who were in|tru&s;ted Abroad with the Management and Government of the Co|lony, under the Name of Councellours.</P>
<P>That the Equippage &s;ent by the Company on their fir&s;t Expediti|on, for &s;ettling a Colony in <HI>America,</HI> was, in all Re&s;pects, &s;uperi|or to any that was ever before &s;ent on the like Account, by any pri|vat Society in <HI>Europe,</HI> is what I never heard in the lea&s;t contraver|ted: And as the Generality of the Men who went on that Expedition, gave former Proofs to the World, in their re&s;pective Stations, du|ring the la&s;t War, of their Fitne&s;s for &s;uch an Undertaking; &s;o it has been agreed upon, by all that ever &s;aw them, not only when they went away, but al&s;o after their Arrival and Settlement in <HI>America,</HI> that they were, &s;eemingly, as hopeful and promi&s;ing a Set of Men, as
<PB N="14" REF="8">
ever were &s;een (to the Memory of Man) in tho&s;e Parts; had they been under the Government and Care of &s;uch Heads as were to be wi&s;h'd: But many People do &s;ay, that the Council appointed for the Government of the Colony, was compo&s;ed of an odd kind of Mix|ture of Per&s;ons, of Heterogeneous Humours and Principles, and that few of them were fit for that Station.</P>
<P>The Truth is, whatever may be in this, I'm certain that the Directors were at no &s;mall Pains to invite &s;uch as they thought mo&s;t capable for that Station; but it not being publickly known, where they were de&s;ign'd to &s;ettle, there were but very few Candidates; and there's nothing I know better, than that tho&s;e of them who were mo&s;t &s;trongly recommended as Per&s;ons of Capacity, Honour and Hone&s;ty, prov'd to be the lea&s;t de&s;erving of that Character, of all that went under the Denomination of Councellours.</P>
<P>I was told, indeed, that there was too much Emulation, Jealou&s;y, private Animo&s;ities, and Pique among them&s;elves; and that the bad Example thereof gave too much ground to believe, that the like Ani|mo&s;ities were diffu&s;ed among the inferior Officers and others, as they &s;tood &s;everally affected or engaged, more or le&s;s, to this or that Councellour: Yet, by the Influence of &s;ome few of the di&s;creete&s;t of their number, for above Eight Months time together, they had &s;o much Prudence, as to &s;tiffle tho&s;e Divi&s;ions (as much as po&s;&s;ible) in all publick Concerns, for carrying on the common Intere&s;t; as may evidently appear by the Unanimity and Di&s;cretion of all their Ad|vices and Letters to the Directors at Home, as well as by their pub|lick Tran&s;actions with &s;uch as had to do with them in <HI>America;</HI> par|ticularly in all their Tran&s;actions with the <HI>Indians,</HI> the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Panama,</HI> the Governours of <HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Sancta Maria,</HI> and the Commander of a <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;el, which happen'd to be Shipwrack'd near their Settlement; &amp; their Diligence and Care in building of Hou&s;es, clearing of the Ground, and fortifying of their Settlement, in &s;uch manner, that it was look'd upon, by all that &s;aw it, or had account of it, to be almo&s;t Impregnable; till that about the latter-end of

<P>Yet &s;uch was the Excellence of the <HI>Con&s;titutions</HI> by which they were to Govern, that by means thereof, and by the Providential Recovery of one of their Number out of a de&s;perate Sickne&s;s, to ca&s;t the Ballance, they quickly wrought their own Cure: For by the a&s;&s;umption of Three or Four New Councellours, and the humorous withdrawing of two of the Old, who&s;e Places were thereupon de&s;ervedly declared Vacant; the Council wrought it &s;elf &s;o into one piece, that their Actings look'd then, like that of one Man: And tho the Sea&s;on had, all of a &s;udden, (as is &s;aid) &s;owred &s;ome of their Provi&s;ions (which continued very Good till the Rains came on in <HI>April)</HI> and tho their Men turn'd afterwards very Sickly upon their Hands; yet they were firmly re&s;olved to maintain that Place and Intere&s;t to the la&s;t, as appears by the Letters which they di&s;patched Home upon that Occa&s;ion, pre&s;&s;ing that Supplies might be &s;ent to them with all Expedition.</P>
<P>And in the mean time, they not only engaged one Captain <HI>Ephra|im Pilkington</HI> of <HI>Port-Royal</HI> (who had been, it &s;eems, &s;ometime in their Service, and was re&s;olved to bring his whole Family to live in <HI>Ca|ledonia)</HI> to return with his Shallop full of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions and &s;trong Liquors from <HI>Jamaica;</HI> but &s;ent al&s;o a Sloop of their own thither, with Money and Goods to purcha&s;e Provi&s;ions; yet neither the one, nor the other, could have any, by Rea&s;on of the Proclamation that was publi&s;hed there &s;ometime before: And it is very ob&s;ervable, that the &s;aid Proclamation, was, for ha&s;te's &s;ake, publi&s;hed at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> upon a <HI>Sunday,</HI> being the 9<HI>th</HI> day of <HI>April,</HI> to &s;top two other Sloops that were ready to &s;ail from thence next Morning, with Provi&s;ions and &s;trong Liquors for <HI>Caledonia.</HI></P>

All which Sugge&s;tions were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully improved by the Per&s;on, whom I have heard, mo&s;t blamed upon that Occa&s;ion, that he found, at la&s;t, the &s;aid Proclamations gave him a Handle to &s;ay or propo&s;e any thing what&s;oever, tho never &s;o villainous; and particularly, <HI>That as, by the &s;aid Proclamations, they were po&s;itively declared to have broken the Peace, by &s;ettling at</HI> Darien; <HI>&s;o of con&s;equence they were declared Pyrates; and that, as they could not think of &s;taying there, abandon'd by all the World, &s;o it would be dangerous for them to go to any of the</HI> Briti&s;h <HI>Do|minions, for fear of Hanging:</HI> And therefore propo&s;ed, <HI>that they &s;hould &s;ail directly to</HI> Hamburgh, <HI>or &s;ome other Foreign Port, and di&s;po&s;e of the Ships and Effects; or at lea&s;t to take up Money upon them, to pay the Seamen their Wages.</HI> Which Pretence, he thought, might &s;uffici|ently baite many (at lea&s;t the Seamen) to clo&s;e with his Propo&s;al: But the Propo&s;al was &s;o &s;elf-evidently Wicked, Unnatural, and In|con&s;i&s;tent with the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by the Company, that it was exploded with Reproach, by all tho&s;e who had any Ho|nour or Hone&s;ty in them, and &s;o fell to the Ground; Tho' the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> away was what few or none (it &s;eems) &s;aid any thing mate|rial

<P>Now to recapitulate the whole Matter, you &s;ee the &s;um of what tho&s;e in the Colony do offer in ju&s;tification of their coming away, is their being in &s;uch de&s;perate Circum&s;tances, that in a crowd of confu&s;ed and perplexed Thoughts, they believed the longer they would &s;tay there, the wor&s;e it would be for them: Becau&s;e &s;everal Species's of tho&s;e few Provi&s;ions which they had left, were rotting (as they &s;ay) upon their hands; mo&s;t of their Men fell &s;ick and weak|ly, with but &s;lender Hopes of their Recovery, for want of fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, &s;trong Liquors, and good Looking after; and were out of all manner of Hopes of getting any Supplies, by rea&s;on of the Proclamations, and the Story above-narrated, e&s;pecially having had no Word from <HI>Scotland</HI> all the time; which fully determin'd them in that Fatal Re&s;olution of coming away, (Bag and Baggage) Steering their Cour&s;e to <HI>New-York,</HI> in Hopes to get &s;ome Provi&s;ions there, in Barter for Goods, which might carry them to <HI>Scotland:</HI> But how Inhumanely they were Treated by the Government there (tho' the Generality of the People were inclined to be kind to them) in their di&s;tre&s;s'd Condition, is too well known; as is al&s;o the Bar|barous Treatment, which tho&s;e on board the <HI>Saint-Andrew</HI> met with, from the Government of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> upon her being (it &s;eems) for|ced in there by Stre&s;s of Weather, and to &s;hun the <HI>Barlavento-Fleet,</HI> which gave her Chace for &s;ome days.</P>
<P>By all which, (if true, as is, indeed, generally &s;aid and believed) it &s;eems to me naturally conclu&s;ive, that, tho' I'm far from &s;etting

up to ju&s;tify any E&s;capes or Omi&s;&s;ions, that the Directors at Home may be truly chargeable with, or to le&s;&s;en any Imprudence, Ra&s;h|ne&s;s or Divi&s;ions, that I have heard the Council of the Colony blamed for; yet the Burden of the Song &s;till re&s;ts on the Effects of tho&s;e Pro|clamations; becau&s;e that, if tho&s;e Proclamations had not been pub|li&s;hed, I am morally a&s;&s;ured, that even the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Mi&s;takes in the Management, either at Home or in the Colony, would have been &s;oon mended of Cour&s;e, from the Experience that mu&s;t have been had of the Con&s;equences of their own Omi&s;&s;ions and Mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>And whoever would be at the pains, but to examine the fir&s;t Con|duct and Management of the mo&s;t Flouri&s;hing Trading-Companies this day in <HI>Europe,</HI> might ea&s;ily find, that they have, not only in their In|fancy, but even after a much longer &s;tanding, been guilty of, at lea&s;t, as gro&s;s Mi&s;takes and Omi&s;&s;ions, as any that I ever, as yet, heard the Directors of our Company ju&s;tly charged with, and that there is no &s;uch thing to be precedented, or, indeed, rea&s;onably expected, as In|fallibility in any Humane Conduct; e&s;pecially in a Matter, where|of the good, as well as the bad, Succe&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly depend on a great many unfore&s;een Accidents.</P>
<P>And yet the Truth is, after all, The mo&s;t Plau&s;ible and Material Objections, which I have heard &s;ugge&s;ted again&s;t the Fore&s;ight and Care of the Directors at Home, are, 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> That they imployed Per&s;ons in Fitting out the Ships, Goods, Provi&s;ions, and other Ne|ce&s;&s;aries for their fir&s;t Expedition, as made no Con&s;cience of the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; for that the Numbers, Quantities and Qua|lities of tho&s;e Goods and Provi&s;ions, were far &s;hort of what they were given out for, and &s;ome of them rotten, even before they went from hence. And, 2<HI>ly,</HI> That they &s;hould Tru&s;t to the Uncer|tainty of a Corre&s;pondence, by the Way of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, and not be at the Charges of &s;ending Letters and Advices frequently by &s;ome Packet-Boats of their own, directly from hence to the Colony; which would undoubtedly have prevented their co|ming away in &s;uch De&s;pair of being relieved from hence, as they &s;ay they did.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="10">
This &s;eems indeed, at fir&s;t View, to be a heavy Charge, tho' it may be ju&s;tly An&s;wered for the <HI>Court of Directors, Fir&s;t,</HI> That tho&s;e imployed by them, for the Purpo&s;es afore&s;aid, were not only of their own Number, and cho&s;en by the general Suffrage of the Ad|venturers in the Joint-Stock; but were al&s;o reputed Merchants of con&s;iderable Sub&s;tance and Dealing, and might therefore be rea&s;o|nably pre&s;um'd, not only to have under&s;tood that Matter of buying and providing Goods, Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries for a Sea-Voyage, better than tho&s;e Noblemen and other Gentlemen in the Direction, who never had Occa&s;ion formerly to be concern'd in a Matter of that Nature; but al&s;o, that they them&s;elves being con&s;ide|rably intere&s;ted in the Joint-Stock, and intru&s;ted with the particular Stock, of many of their own Friends, Relations and Acquaintances, and indeed with that which they mu&s;t needs have known, was of Univer|&s;al Concern to the whole Nation; That they would act at lea&s;t as tenderly and con&s;cientiou&s;ly therein, as any other Per&s;ons what&s;o|ever, who were not &s;o immediatly concerned.</P>
<P>And for the&s;e few Directors, who were imployed for buying tho&s;e Goods and Provi&s;ions, I dare confidently affirm, in favour of &s;ome of them, that they not only under&s;tood, and were pretty much accu&s;|tomed with Di&s;patches of that kind, (tho' differing perhaps in the Degree) but that they acted al&s;o with as much Care, Diligence, Integrity, and real Zeal for the Company's Intere&s;t, as any in the Kingdom could have done; &s;o that I reckon, whenever that Matter is fully inquired into, and all Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, it will be found, that there was no &s;uch great Abu&s;e, in either the Quantities or Qualities of tho&s;e Goods and Provi&s;ions, as &s;ome would have us believe there was: Tho' at the &s;ame time, (I mu&s;t confe&s;s) I have, from the beginning, heard one or two of tho&s;e Directors extreme|ly blamed, for making &s;ome Bargains for the Company, with an alledged vi&s;ible Advantage to them&s;elves: And tho' it mu&s;t be gran|ted, that it were much better for the Company's Intere&s;t, they had never acted with any &s;uch Selfi&s;h View; yet, granting they did &s;o, (which I do not believe) it is very po&s;&s;ible, they might have con|trived

<P>But yet, to let you &s;ee the Effects of tho&s;e Proclamations, even in point of bare Corre&s;pondence; I do a&s;&s;ure you, that &s;everal of the Company's Packets directed to the <HI>Council</HI> of their Colony, under cover to particular Friends in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations of <HI>America,</HI> are to this Hour lying in the Hands of tho&s;e Friends; who wrote back hither, <Q>That by Rea&s;on of the Strictne&s;s and Severity of tho&s;e Proclamations, they dur&s;t not venture to foreward the &s;aid Pac|kets to the Colony; becau&s;e, if they &s;hould happen to be di&s;cover|ed in holding any &s;uch Corre&s;pondence (as Ten to One but they would) the lea&s;t that they could expect, was Confinement, and to be afterwards &s;ined at the next Grand Se&s;&s;ion, by the Di&s;creti|on of a Jury, and that the Di&s;cretion of that Jury would be dire|cted by the degree of Love they bear our Country, and the Wi&s;h|es they have to the Pro&s;perity of an Undertaking of this Nature.</Q> By which it is plain, That the Proclamations have put a &s;top to the Colony's getting Intelligence from hence, and that if no &s;uch Procla|mations had been i&s;&s;ued forth, there had been no &s;uch indi&s;pen&s;ible

Nece&s;&s;ity for Packet-Boats, to have been &s;ent directly from hence to the Colony, at lea&s;t before the Directors had an account of their Settlement, as &s;ome mighty Pretenders will tell us now there was.</P>
<P>And yet neverthele&s;s, it's evident by what has been already &s;aid, that the Directors did po&s;itively intend to have di&s;patched a Ve&s;&s;el with Advice and Provi&s;ions to the Colony very &s;oon after their De|parture from <HI>Leith;</HI> and for that end, u&s;ed all other endeavours by Petition, and otherwi&s;e, to have procured one or two of the &s;mall Friggots, which are &s;till lying u&s;ele&s;s in <HI>Brunti&s;land-Harbour,</HI> as be|ing the fitte&s;t they could think of, for that Purpo&s;e; and in regard that the Parliament was pleas'd to order the building of tho&s;e Frig|gots for the Security and Advantage of the Trade of the Kingdom, and that the Conclu&s;ion of the General Peace, took away all man|ner of Occa&s;ion for them in the narrow Seas, it was thought they could not be otherwi&s;e &s;o well imploy'd, as in carrying on and &s;up|porting the De&s;igns and Intere&s;t of this Company, e&s;pecially &s;ince the E&s;tates of Parliament, by their Addre&s;s, formerly recited, were plea&s;|ed to expre&s;s a &s;ingular Concern for it's Pro&s;perity and Welfare. And if the Directors &s;aid Petition had been &s;econded, as well as was ex|pected, and that they had got the U&s;e of all or any of the &s;aid Frig|gots, there had been, in all probability, no &s;uch occa&s;ion of Cla|mour again&s;t them, as now there is, for not having &s;ent any Ships directly from hence to the Colony, &s;oon enough, with Provi&s;ions and Intelligence.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s, 'tis likewi&s;e evident, by what has been already narrated, that upon the Directors lo&s;ing Hopes of procuring any of the &s;aid Friggots, they came to a po&s;itive Re&s;olution of di&s;patching a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, directly from hence to the Colony, with Advice and Provi&s;ions, in the Month of <HI>January</HI> at furthe&s;t; tho', as cro&s;s Fate would have it, &s;he happen'd to be &s;uch a Ship, as could not well be fitted out for &s;uch a Voyage, in &s;ome Months time thereafter: Upon di&s;covery whereof, they fitted another &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, which &s;ail'd from <HI>Clyde</HI> in the Month of <HI>February,</HI> but was unluckily Shipwrack'd

by a violent Storm on the We&s;t-Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as I have former|ly narrated.</P>
<P>Yet &s;till there are &s;ome, who (right or wrong) will have the Ma|nagement bear the &s;ole Blame of all the Mi&s;-fortunes that have hap|pen'd to the Company and Colony, and &s;tick not to &s;ay too, that the Colony's coming away, in the manner they did, was not occa|&s;ion'd &s;o much by the Effects of tho&s;e Proclamations, as by the Treachery and Villainy of &s;ome of their own Number.</P>
<P>Well, let us for once &s;uppo&s;e there was Treachery in the Ca&s;e; does that le&s;&s;en the Effects of tho&s;e Proclamations? No certainly, but rather aggravates: For if there was any Treachery in the ca&s;e, the&s;e Proclamations gave the Traitors a better Handle to work by, than any other Pretence they could have made u&s;e of.</P>
<P>I would gladly know further, whether we can &s;uppo&s;e there could be Treachery, without &s;uppo&s;ing at the &s;ame time, that &s;ome Per|&s;on or other mu&s;t have brib'd the Traitor? And if &s;o, it &s;eems na|tural to believe, that none would be &s;o ready to do that, as &s;ome of tho&s;e who were concerned in i&s;&s;uing forth tho&s;e Proclamations: So that &s;till we are cloven to pieces with a Wedge of the &s;ame Timber.</P>
<P>Nay further, what if (notwith&s;tanding of tho&s;e Proclamations) the Colony had never budged, but remained &s;till in their Settlement, in a flouri&s;hing Condition; and that they had been in &s;uch Circum&s;tan|ces, that the Proclamations could have done them no Harm? Shall any Man therefore mantain, that the i&s;&s;uing forth of tho&s;e Procla|mations was a good and harmle&s;s Thing? Sure no Man has Face enough to &s;ay &s;o: For, their having, or not having, the de&s;ign'd Effect, could not at all alter the Nature or Intention of them.</P>
<P>But really, for my part, I cannot conceive how it could be po&s;&s;ible, for a Colony, con&s;i&s;ting of the King of <HI>Britain</HI>'s Subjects, to have been in any &s;uch good circum&s;tances, but that tho&s;e Proclamations mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly have done them a va&s;t prejudice, if not ruin'd them: For, &s;uppo&s;e that in the Month of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t, when they got the fir&s;t Copy of the <HI>Jamaica</HI>-Proclamation, they had been all in perfect

in <HI>Barbados</HI> and <HI>Jamaica</HI> in the Month of <HI>April,</HI> and in all the other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, in &s;ome &s;hort time thereafter; But that, upon &s;econd Orders, a &s;econd Fleece of Proclamations &s;hould be likewi&s;e publi&s;hed by the &s;ame Per&s;ons, and in the &s;ame Places, to let the World &s;ee that the fir&s;t were not grounded upon Mi&s;take, but that they were re|&s;olved to make their Putt good: For upon the 5th day of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, a &s;econd Proclamation, pretty near in Sub&s;tance with the for|mer, was publi&s;hed in <HI>Barbados;</HI> and &s;ome of tho&s;e lately come from <HI>New-York,</HI> in the Company's Ship the <HI>Caledonia,</HI> do Report, That three or four Days before they &s;et &s;ail from thence, there were fre&s;h Orders arriv'd at <HI>New-England,</HI> for emitting and publi&s;hing &s;econd Proclamations in tho&s;e parts, again&s;t our Colony; which gives us &s;ufficient ground to believe that like Orders were &s;ent to all the other Plantations.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch as have a Mind to be Talking, will always find &s;ome|thing to Amu&s;e the Multitude withal, be it never &s;o little to the purpo&s;e: And thus we find &s;ome People &s;till urging, that notwith|&s;tanding of tho&s;e Proclamations, &s;ome Inhabitants in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, who are Zealous Well-Wi&s;hers to this Undertaking, have, &s;ince the Publication of tho&s;e Proclamations, &s;ent &s;ome Sloops and Brigantines to the <HI>Colony;</HI> and that therefore the Proclamati|ons were not the Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Colony's</HI> coming away from <HI>Dari|en,</HI> but that the &s;ame proceeded from other Cau&s;es; and that if the <HI>Colony</HI> had &s;taid &s;till, and maintain'd their Settlement, more Sloops and Brigantines would, beyond all peradventure, be &s;ent to them from time to time, till the Company's own Ships &s;hould arrive there.</P>
<P>Well! All this is very plau&s;ible; and I think our Nation, as well as the Company, is very much beholden to the Generous and Kind Inclinations of tho&s;e Gentlemen, who ventured any part of their own Intere&s;t &s;o frankly, to &s;upport that of the Company or Colony: But, as it happen'd, Pray what was the Colony the better for it? Did any of tho&s;e Sloops or Brigantins arrive at <HI>Darien,</HI> before the
<PB N="33" REF="17">
Colony's Departure thence? Or had the Colony &s;o much as the lea&s;t Advice, that any &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els were a-coming to them? No certain|ly, I &s;uppo&s;e no Man can or will &s;ay &s;o; And without that, they &s;ay nothing at all: For, how mean &s;oever my Opin on may per|haps be of the Colony's Conduct and Re&s;olution, not only upon that unlucky Occa&s;ion, but in other Re&s;pects too: Yet I have &s;o much Charity, as to believe &s;incerely, that if they had expected any &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els to have come to them with Provi&s;ions, in any rea&s;onable time, or if they had known, that they had any &s;uch real Friends and Well-Wi&s;hers in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, as it &s;eems they had, or that Supplies and Recruits were &s;o near them coming from <HI>Scot|land,</HI> that they would not have come away from <HI>Darien,</HI> at lea&s;t, before they had had &s;ome certain and po&s;itive Orders from the Company, how to behave with relation to tho&s;e Proclamations: But &s;o it is, to their own and the Company's Sorrow, as well as the Nations Di&s;grace, whatever may be the Occa&s;ion of it, away, you &s;ee, they are come, as ill Luck would have it:
<Q><L>Quae volunt Fata, non tollunt Vota.</L></Q></P>
<P>Upon the Directors having received certain Intelligence of this Tragical and Unexpected Emergency, they laid the whole Matter in Writing before the Council-General of the Company; who there|upon thought fit, in mo&s;t Dutiful and Humble Manner, to repre|&s;ent the &s;ame to His Maje&s;ty, by their Petition of the 29<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>Octo|ber</HI> la&s;t, wherein they &s;eem to intimat, that without &s;ome &s;pecial Te&s;timonies and Evidence of His Maje&s;ty's Gracious Favour, and Royal Protection, as well as the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of a Parliament, they could not well expect, but that the be&s;t of their Endeavours, for carrying on and &s;upporting an Undertaking of this Nature, mu&s;t prove altogether vain: And therefore, their Petition con&s;i&s;ted brief|ly of two Articles, 1&s;t. <HI>That His Maje&s;ty would be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to take off the Force and Effects of the&s;e Proclamations; And,</HI> 2dly, <HI>That His Maje&s;ty would allow the Parliament to meet in</HI> November <HI>la&s;t,</HI> it being adjourn'd till that time.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="18">
They at the &s;ame time Addre&s;s'd His Maje&s;ty's mo&s;t Honourable Privy Council, with relation to the Contents of their &s;aid Petition to His Maje&s;ty; But what the Privy Council did therein, I know not: And as for His Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer to the &s;aid Petition, you have already &s;een it, &s;o I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to make any Comments up|on it.</P>
<P>However the Council-General of the Company having, it &s;eems, about the beginning of this Month, re&s;olved to Addre&s;s His Maje&s;ty, in a mo&s;t Dutiful Manner, upon an other Head; And con&s;idering, that none of their former Addre&s;&s;es or Petitions had &s;uch Succe&s;s, as they could have wi&s;h'd for, and that they were all tran&s;mitted, in the ordinary way, to the Secretary of State, in waiting for the time; they re&s;olved to &s;end this Addre&s;s by one of their own Number, who &s;hould, at the &s;ame time, have particular In&s;tructions with re|lation to the Contents of their former Petitions, and &s;hould carry along with him Letters to the Secretaries of State, intimating his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s and entreating their Concurrence.</P>
<P>Whether this Method may produce better Effects than their for|mer, I know not; but &s;ome People are plea&s;ed to progno&s;ticat, that if in this as well as in former Ages, there &s;hould happen to be any &s;uch Favourites or Courtiers near his Maje&s;ties Per&s;on, as may per|haps endeavour to make a Monopoly of the King's Ear, that it will never be plea&s;ing to &s;uch to &s;ee any Corn pa&s;s by their own Mills; and that therefore they may readily endeavour to give it a State-Turn: But until I &s;ee it, I &s;hall never &s;uffer my &s;elf to believe any &s;uch thing; for as the King is a Gracious Prince, &s;o his Ears will be equally o|pen to all his People.</P>
<P>I am informed, That the <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Merchants, or at lea&s;t their Agents at <HI>London,</HI> are now preparing a Repre&s;entation to be made (if not already done) complaining that the Proclamations which were publi&s;hed in the Plantations, &s;trictly forbidding them to carry or &s;ell Provi&s;ions or other Nece&s;&s;aries to the <HI>Scots</HI> Colony, are con|trary to their Rights and Liberties, and prejudicial to their Intere&s;ts; and that the Friends of the &s;everal Governours, who publi&s;h'd tho&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="18">
Proclamations happening to hear thereof, are endeavouring to &s;tif|fle the&s;e Complaints as much as they can: But what Truth there may be in this, a little time mu&s;t &s;hew.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e ju&s;t now told, that his Maje&s;ty has been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to declare that he knew nothing of tho&s;e <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Proclama|tions, till he had &s;een Copies of them come from thence: And if in|deed it be true, that his Maje&s;ty has &s;aid &s;o (as I hope it is) I rec|kon it would be no very hard Matter to name &s;ome few Per&s;ons who have a great deal to an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>I remember the judicious <HI>Montaigne,</HI> in his political E&s;&s;ays, ob&s;erves it, as a Misfortune commonly incident to a Nation that is under the Govern|ment of a Prince living in another Country, That any Nation &s;o &s;tated, is &s;eldom or never Govern'd according to the real Inclination of the Prince, or the true Intere&s;t of the People; &s;o much as according to the Humors, Affections, and De&s;igns of his Mini&s;ters: For that he &s;eeing only with their Eyes, and hearing but withtheir Ears, cannot po&s;&s;ibly know the true State, Condition and Intere&s;t of a Di&s;tant Nation, nor the Humors and Inclinations of its Inhabitants, any thing near &s;o well as if he lived among&s;t them.</P>
<P><HI>Seneca</HI> in his Treati&s;e of Benefits, puts the Que&s;tion, <HI>Quid omnia po&s;&s;identibus dee&s;t?</HI> What can a Man want that has every thing? And he an&s;wers him&s;elf, <HI>Ille qui verum dicat.</HI> One that will tell him the Truth. And really of all Men living, I think Kings and Princes &s;tand mo&s;t in need of having &s;uch Men near their Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And I wi&s;h, from my Heart, That all tho&s;e who, at any time, have occa&s;ion to be at the Helm of publick Affairs in any Kingdom or State what&s;oever, would &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider what the Learned and wi&s;e State&s;man; <HI>Sir Francis Bacon</HI> ob&s;erves by way of Precaution, in his Judicious and Celebrated E&s;&s;ays. <Q>As for Di&s;contentments (&s;ays he) they are in the politick Body like to Humors in the Natural, which are apt to gather preter-natural Heat, and to en|flame. And let no Prince mea&s;ure the Danger of them by this, whether they be Ju&s;t or Unju&s;t: For that were to imagine People
<PB N="36" REF="19">
to be too Rea&s;onable, who do often Spurn at their own Good: Nor yet by this, whether the Griefs whereupon they ri&s;e, be in Fact great or &s;mall; for they are the mo&s;t dangerous Di&s;content|ments, where the Fear is greater than the Feeling. <HI>Dolendi mo|dus, Timendi non item.</HI> Be&s;ides, in great Oppre&s;&s;ions, the &s;ame things that provoke the Patience, do withal mate the Courage; but in Fears it is not &s;o. Neither let any Prince or State be &s;e|cure concerning Di&s;contentments, becau&s;e they have been often, or have been long; and yet no Peril hath en&s;ued: For as it is true, that every Vapour or Fume doth not turn into a Storm; &s;o it is neverthele&s;s true, that Storms, tho' they blow over divers times, yet may fall at la&s;t: And as the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Proverb noteth well, <HI>The Cord breaketh at the la&s;t, by the weake&s;t Pull.</HI></Q></P>
<P>One Material Pa&s;&s;age I had almo&s;t forgot: Upon the fir&s;t Advice that the Council-General of the Company had of the Colony's &s;afe Arrival and Settlement in <HI>Darien,</HI> they gave His Maje&s;ty an Account thereof, by a very Dutiful Letter, bearing Date at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the 31<HI>&s;t.</HI> Day of <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, wherein they particularly conde&s;cended upon its being <Q>a Place Uninhabited, and never before po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any <HI>European</HI> Prince or State what&s;oever, and that upon the Re|que&s;t, and with the Con&s;ent of the Neighbouring Natives, they Landed and Settled there,</Q> (which con&s;equently made it a Place preci&s;ely in the Terms of His Maje&s;ty's Acts of Parliament and Let|ters Patent) <Q>And withal, that they were po&s;itively informed, that the <HI>French</HI> had a De&s;ign upon all that Coa&s;t, or at lea&s;t to make a Settlement &s;ome where thereabouts; And therefore hum|bly offered to His Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ideration, how that the firm Settlement of the <HI>Scots</HI> Colony there, might be a Means of pre|venting, or at lea&s;t, le&s;&s;ening the evil Con&s;equences that might ari&s;e to His Maje&s;ty's Kingdoms and Dominions every where, by the Settlement of any powerful Forreign Neighbour in, upon, or near any part of that Coa&s;t; And therefore confidently expected His Maje&s;ty's Royal Favour and Protection, in the Maintainanee
<PB N="37" REF="19">
of &s;uch an Important Settlement, as having, in all the Steps of their Conduct, through the whole Cour&s;e of this Affair, &s;trictly ob&s;erved the Conditions required by the &s;aid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent.</Q></P>
<P>And in another Letter, at the &s;ame time, to both the Secreta|ries of State, they have, among&s;t &s;everal other Particulars, the fol|lowing Paragraph: <Q>As to the <HI>French</HI> De&s;igns of &s;ettling thereabouts, (meaning on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Darien)</HI> "it is a Point not to be doubted of; for, in order thereunto, they have already been Tampering with &s;everal of the Natives, &s;ome of whom they have endeavou|red to have carried into <HI>France;</HI> and we have very good rea&s;on to believe, that a further Progre&s;s had been made in that Matter before now, were it not the dayly Expectations which that Court had of the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Death. Which, we humbly conceive, is a Matter worthy of His Maje&s;ty's Con&s;ideration, and of no &s;mall Concern to the Intere&s;t of his whole Dominions, tho' this Nation, and our Company, may &s;eem to be more immediatly intere&s;ted at pre&s;ent.</Q></P>
<P>And to certifie further, That the <HI>French</HI> de&s;igns upon that Coa&s;t did not con&s;i&s;t in Imagination only; Mr. <HI>Pater&s;on,</HI> one of the Councel|lours of the Colony, and <HI>Captain Robert Drummond,</HI> Commander of one of the Company's Ships the <HI>Caledonia,</HI> have, by Declaration un|der their Hands, &s;ignified to the Directors, the Contents of a Letter written in <HI>March</HI> la&s;t, by the Governour of <HI>Portobell</HI> to the Com|mander of a <HI>French</HI> Sloop, which was imployed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to per&s;wade the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Samballo</HI>'s to join again&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> Colo|ny at <HI>Caledonia.</HI> The Letter was written in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and found in a Bottle by &s;ome of our Colony on board of the &s;aid Sloop, near the <HI>Samballos,</HI> where &s;he was left de&s;erted and owned by no Body; and the Contents of the &s;aid Letter is in Sub&s;tance as followeth. <HI>Sir, I have received Advice from</HI> Mon&s;ieur Du Ca&s;s, <HI>Governour of</HI> Petitgua|vis, <HI>wherein he a&s;&s;ures me, that rather than fail, he will come him&s;elf in Per&s;on; but however, he will &s;end four Friggots to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in rioting</HI>

<P>I &s;hall make no Reflections on this Matter, nor &s;hall I pretend to Prophe&s;y; but any one of but an ordinary reach in Speculation, may ea&s;ily &s;ee, that it's very po&s;&s;ible there may be &s;uch a Juncture of time, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation may come to wi&s;h, that this Company had never met with &s;uch unrea&s;onable Ob&s;tructions in the pro&s;ecution of their De&s;igns, as they have done: Nor am I out of Hopes of &s;eeing, perhaps, &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t Men of our Neighbouring Nation, be|come &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Folly, as well as the Inju&s;tice of the unac|countable Treatment which the Company met with, that they may think it their Intere&s;t, even to contribute to the Mantenance of &s;uch an important Settlement on that <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> which now affords &s;o much Matter of Speculation to the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Courts in <HI>Europe.</HI>
