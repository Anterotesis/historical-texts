<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE my la&s;t &s;everal Ships are returned from Major General <HI>Kirk,</HI> who gives this Account, That Major General <HI>Kirk</HI> had Joyned his Grace the Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI> with Fourteen Troops of Hor&s;e, three of Dragoons, and Hor&s;e for three or four Troops more; and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces are Battering <HI>Carrickfergus</HI> with Eight Men of War by Sea, and likewi&s;e by Land, and 'tis not doubted but they will &s;oon be Ma&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>Major <HI>Tiffen,</HI> after the great Defeat near <HI>Inniskilling,</HI> march'd towards Co|lonel <HI>Sarsfield</HI> with one Troop of Hor&s;e, one of Dragoons, and two Com|panys of Foot; but finding him Decampt, and hearing he fled toward <HI>Sligo,</HI> marched after him thither; but when he came he found a clear Stage, the Enemy being fled, and left behind them Fourteen Pieces of Cannon in the Town, of which the &s;aid Major is now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and is Fortifying of that Place.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday at Noon &s;ailed from <HI>High-Lake</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Regiment of Hor&s;e-Guards, commanded by the Right Honourable Colonel <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and like|wi&s;e the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e. This day the Duke of <HI>Bolton</HI>'s Regiment of Foot &s;et Sail from <HI>High-Lake,</HI> and&mdash;<HI>Herbert</HI>'s Troop goes from hence this day to the &s;ame place. Two Troops of Colonel <HI>Villar</HI>'s
<PB REF="2">Regiment of Hor&s;e are come in, and the re&s;t will follow this day, in order to their imbarking for <HI>Ireland</HI> with the fir&s;t fair Wind. We likewi&s;e hear from <HI>Dublin,</HI> by a Ship come into <HI>Beaumaris,</HI> laden with Hides, Tallow, and Lea|ther, wherein were &s;everal Pa&s;&s;engers, as Mr. <HI>Berton,</HI> Servant to Alderman <HI>Fletcher</HI> of <HI>Dublin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Smallman,</HI> Linnen-Drapers, with Mon&s;ieur <HI>La Rue,</HI> Silk-Man, who gives this Account, That King <HI>James</HI> had formed a Camp at <HI>Rathmine,</HI> on the South &s;ide of <HI>Dublin,</HI> compo&s;ed of a|bout 7000 Foot, being all new-rais'd Men, that they had neither Shirts nor Shoes, for the mo&s;t part, and a great Multitude of Women and Children that followed them; and that King <HI>James</HI> had given Orders to all the Pari&s;h-Prie&s;ts, to take an Account of all Per&s;ons from Sixteen to Sixty, and the place of their Abode, that they may be li&s;ted in that Kings Service; and that upon the News of Duke <HI>Schomberg</HI>'s landing, the Camp was ordered to march on the North &s;ide of the Town, intending to form an Army to go and fight him; but the Hor&s;e that return'd from <HI>Derry,</HI> as well as the Foot, were mi&s;era|bly Hara&s;s'd; and a <HI>French</HI> Officer that was in the Engagement before <HI>In|niskilling,</HI> &s;aith, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> behaved them&s;elves to a Wonder, but he never &s;aw &s;uch Cowards as the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> &s;ome of them running Sixteen or Eighteen Miles without &s;taying to look behind them; in&s;omuch that King <HI>James</HI> was &s;o enraged that he cau&s;ed a Captain and a Corporal to be hang|ed for running away, for Example &s;ake: he al&s;o gives Account of a Ship arrived from <HI>France,</HI> with a <HI>French</HI> General and Twenty Officers, with &s;ome Arms, and that they had &s;ecured mo&s;t of the con&s;iderable Prote&s;tants in the We&s;t, not daring to tru&s;t them, and are forming a Camp near <HI>Kin&s;ale,</HI> as fearing the Earl of <HI>Torington</HI> may Land there, being now in de&s;pair of the <HI>French</HI> Succours; and that they have laid up a great Magazine in <HI>Ath|loane,</HI> and Fortified <HI>Gallway</HI> for a &s;afe Retreat: But we hope the Victori|ous and Renowned General <HI>Schomberg</HI> will &s;oon cool their Courage, ha|ving as we hear taken the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Carrickfergus</HI> by Storm; &s;o that he will be at liberty to march towards <HI>Dublin,</HI> having receiv'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, who already forage up as far as the <HI>Newry</HI> and <HI>Charlemont.</HI> In our next we expect to hear of &s;ome Con&s;iderable Action, in the mean time I am your Humble Servant.</P>
