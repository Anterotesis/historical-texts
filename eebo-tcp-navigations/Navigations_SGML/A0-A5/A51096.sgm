<HEAD>A <HI>Mode&s;t Enquiry</HI> INTO THE Pre&s;ent MISCARRIAGES In <HI>ENGLAND,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;ee the <HI>French Ma&s;ters at Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Glory thus &s;unk in the eyes of all <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> by a Complication of <HI>Di&s;a&s;ters,</HI> cannot but rai&s;e the Curio&s;ity of all true Lovers of their Countrey to enquire into the Source and Cau&s;e of &s;o important E|vents. That we who have been able to make &s;o great a Figure in the World, e|ven long before the Acce&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>Scotland</HI> to <HI>Ours,</HI> and to turn the Scale of <HI>Europe</HI> to whatever Side we e&s;pou|&s;ed; and who have &s;o often dyed with our Enemies Blood, the Fields of <HI>France,</HI> and ac|quir'd
<PB N="2" REF="3"> &s;o many Laurels in that Countrey, &s;hould at this very moment be oblig'd to turn our Backs to that very <HI>Enemy</HI> whom we have &s;o often beaten, and upon that ve|ry <HI>Element</HI> which Nature and the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;ome Ages had made properly <HI>our own;</HI> Who could ever have dream'd! Let us therefore enquire into the Cau&s;es of our pre&s;ent Misfortunes, and let us do it with that impartiality the Subject requires. It's but ju&s;t the Authors and Abettors of <HI>Eng|land</HI>'s Mi&s;eries, &s;hould be retriev'd from O|blivion, and their Infamy &s;hould be handed down to the unhappy Children, that &s;hall have rea&s;on to cur&s;e their Fathers Villanies and Trea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>England</HI> within the&s;e few years has been amu&s;ed with <HI>three</HI> different <HI>Plots,</HI> and to be carried on by <HI>three</HI> different <HI>Parties;</HI> but at the <HI>bottom,</HI> we have had but <HI>one Plot,</HI> and that carried on &amp; manag'd but by <HI>two Parties,</HI> in con&s;tant <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> with one another. We fir&s;t of all &s;aw a <HI>Popi&s;h one</HI> laid open and di&s;|cover'd, with as <HI>demon&s;trative clearne&s;s,</HI> as &s;uch Helli&s;h Works of Darkne&s;s could admit of. The King <HI>&s;eemd,</HI> and the Parliament and whole <HI>Nation</HI> did really <HI>believe</HI> the Reality of
<PB N="3" REF="3"> this Plot. But within a little time the&s;e two unhappy Parties, the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and the High|flown <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience men,</HI> (both equally the cau&s;e of all our Woes) joyn'd hand in hand to turn this Popi&s;h Plot into ridicule; and by a complication of <HI>Subornations, In|triegues,</HI> and <HI>Perjuries,</HI> they at la&s;t got it hi&s;s'd out of doors.</P>
<P>Then it was the Pulpits began to ring with Outcries again&s;t tho&s;e <HI>true blew Prote&s;tants</HI> (as they and their admired <HI>Buffoon, L'Estrange,</HI> call'd them in deri&s;ion) who had the &s;auci|ne&s;s to endeavour the <HI>Exclu&s;ion</HI> of the then <HI>Duke of York</HI> from the <HI>Crown,</HI> as the only means to &s;ave <HI>England</HI> from a Ruin that threatned her. There was nothing at that time to be heard, in the mo&s;t of our Church|es, but <HI>the Divine Right of Succe&s;&s;ion; the &s;ingu|lar Loyalty of the Duke to his Brother; and the horridne&s;s of the Attempt to &s;et &s;o Pious &s;o Ge|nerous, &s;o well-natur'd a Prince be&s;ide the Throne:</HI> Yea, it was become a kind of Trea&s;on to dare to &s;ay, <HI>He was a Papi&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>It was not enough the <HI>Popi&s;h Plot</HI> &s;hould be hi&s;s'd off the &s;tage; our two loving Parties employed their utmo&s;t diligence to &s;ham the world with a <HI>Whig Plot</HI> (for &s;o they chri&s;tned
<PB N="4" REF="4"> it) as the only proper method to revenge them&s;elves upon the wi&s;e and more moderate part of the Nation, that had been more for|ward than others in the Di&s;covery of the <HI>Po|pi&s;h one.</HI> How this &s;ham Prote&s;tant Plot was managed, and what Sacrifices were offered up to the Revenge of an <HI>implacable Prince,</HI> the barbarous Murther of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with the illegal Executions of the Lord <HI>Ru&s;&s;el, Algernon Sidney,</HI> and many others, do &s;peak out more than words can.</P>
<P>This <HI>Whig Plot</HI> was eccho'd in the <HI>Pulpits</HI> with all the villanous Names Hell could in|vent: And to be a <HI>Whig,</HI> was then a thou&s;and times wor&s;e than to be a <HI>Mahometan.</HI> Every little Creature that had got into a Pulpit by the beneficence of a Patron, perhaps as &s;illy as him&s;elf, though he could not &s;ufficiently de&s;erve his Ten or Twelve Pounds a year, unle&s;s he belch'd out once a Sunday, all the &s;tench he po&s;&s;ibly could, again&s;t the poor Whigs; and indeed the &s;o doing was the pro|pere&s;t way to come to Preferment. Now un|der the Name of <HI>Whig,</HI> they comprehended then, as well as now, not only the Di&s;&s;enters, but all tho&s;e of the Clergy or Laicks, that came not up to that mad height of <HI>theirs,</HI> in
<PB N="5" REF="4"> point of <HI>Ceremonies, Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience, Divine Right of Succe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>King <HI>Charles</HI> being hurried off the Stage, God knows how; The <HI>Duke of</HI> York &s;uc|ceeds with the loud Acclamations of the two Parties I have named, and with the <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ilence</HI> of the re&s;t of the Nation. Our High|flown Church-men &s;trove, which of them un|der&s;tood the Art of Flattery be&s;t, in their Addre&s;&s;es to King <HI>James:</HI> And ev'ry <HI>thirtieth of January</HI> was &s;olemniz'd with Peals of Ord|nance from the Pulpits again&s;t the poor Whigs, for not only taking away the Life of the Father, but endeavouring to exclude the be&s;t, and the mo&s;t pious Prince in the World, his Son from the Succe&s;&s;ion, by that <HI>accurs'd Bill of Exclu&s;ion.</HI> Indeed this <HI>Anniver&s;ary-day,</HI> had &s;omething in it like the <HI>Bacchanalia</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> wherein Slaves and Servants might &s;afe|ly in&s;ult and hector their Ma&s;ters: And it often fell out, that a &s;illy Fellow, who by Importunity, and perhaps wor&s;e means, had gotten into a Living, dur&s;t on this <HI>general Madding-day,</HI> reproach to his Face his Patron that gave him Bread, meerly becau&s;e he was either a Whig, or at lea&s;t would not bellow out Reproaches again&s;t that &s;ide, as loud as others.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>But alas! poor King <HI>James</HI> &s;oon lo&s;t the kindne&s;s of the&s;e his former <HI>Votaries:</HI> For he who had been told every day, <HI>He might do what he pleas'd, and was accountable to none but God;</HI> thought He might &s;afely venture to make tryal of the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> of them that told him &s;o. Here he was mightily mi&s;taken, and hence he may date all his Misfortunes. The Devil might much more ju&s;tly &s;ay of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience Gen|tlemen, in relation to King <HI>James,</HI> than of <HI>Job</HI> of old, in relation to God Almighty; <HI>Do they &s;erve thee for nought? Ha&s;t thou not made a hedge about them, and about their hou&s;e, and about all that ever they have, on every &s;ide? But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that they have, and they will cur&s;e thee to thy face</HI> And as long as King <HI>James</HI> was care&s;&s;ing them, and giving them not only good Words, but good Deeds, e&s;pecially <HI>a belov'd power to trample on the Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> Then it was, He <HI>was the be&s;t King in the World:</HI> But whenever his Je&s;uited Coun&s;ellors hrd advis'd him to in|fringe in the lea&s;t the&s;e mens Priviledges, Then their Complaints of King <HI>James</HI> were heard further off than <HI>England,</HI> and the very Nations abroad were deafen'd with the noi&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="5"> of their trifling Afflictions, and indeed more they were not, if compar'd with what other People met with from that Prince's <HI>Mini|&s;ters.</HI></P>
<P>Then was there nothing heard of among the&s;e Gentlemen, <HI>but how far the King had broken his Oath to maintain the Church of</HI> Eng|land, and how far he had invaded their <HI>Liber|ties</HI> and <HI>Priviledges,</HI> but e&s;pecially in <HI>allowing a Toleration to the Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> For a Toleration to Papi&s;ts alone, they would ea&s;ily have &s;wallowed; but that the Di&s;&s;enters (whom in their Pulpits they had a thou&s;and times over call'd wor&s;e than the Papi&s;ts) &s;hould be free from their Clutches, and &s;hould en|joy a perfect freedom from their Cen&s;ures, was a thing intollerable to them. Their &s;e|cret Murmurings broke out at length into o|pen Complaints; And in fine, His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, the then <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> could get no re&s;t from their Importunities; But come over he mu&s;t, and <HI>&s;ettle things on a &s;ure bot|tom:</HI> And it was they who were mo&s;t active in inviting him over to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Prince from a Generous Principle of Zeal for the Prote&s;tant Religion, which was indeed by this time on the brink of Ruine, and
<PB N="8" REF="6"> which none had ha&s;tened more forward than our <HI>high-flown Pa&s;&s;ive-obedience Men;</HI> He <HI>un|dertook</HI> an <HI>Enterprize</HI> of the great'&s;t <HI>Con&s;equence</HI> that this <HI>Age</HI> has &s;een, and ventur'd his <HI>All,</HI> to retrieve <HI>three Nations</HI> from a fate that impend|ed over them. The be&s;t and &s;obere&s;t part of the <HI>Nation</HI> ro&s;e for <HI>His Maje&s;ty</HI> upon his land|ing; and who prov'd more <HI>forward</HI> than <HI>&s;ome</HI> of <HI>our Pa&s;&s;ive-obedience Men them&s;elves</HI> at that time? Not only they declar'd for him, not only addre&s;s'd they K. <HI>James</HI> for a Parliament in order <HI>to Pinion Him,</HI> which is all <HI>one</HI> on the matter as to <HI>dethrone Him;</HI> but likewi&s;e upon that King's going away, they meet with the re&s;t of <HI>the Peers and Members of Parliament,</HI> and joyntly invite the <HI>Prince</HI> to take upon him the <HI>Government,</HI> and to exerci&s;e a <HI>Power</HI> that wanted <HI>nothing of a King,</HI> but the <HI>Name.</HI></P>
<P>One would have thought that <HI>Party,</HI> and the <HI>Gentleman</HI> at <HI>Lambeth,</HI> their <HI>Head,</HI> had been very <HI>cordial</HI> in <HI>bringing about this Revolution,</HI> &s;ince they went as far as any of their <HI>Neigh|bours</HI> at fir&s;t in all the &s;teps of it. But alas! We were mi&s;taken, the&s;e <HI>worthy Gentlemen</HI> had other aims than we knew of. They con|curr'd in the inviting the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> o|ver to <HI>England;</HI> in declaring for him after
<PB N="9" REF="6"> he came; and in fine, in addre&s;&s;ing him to take upon him the <HI>Government</HI> in &s;o difficult Jun|cture. But this was all in order to make u&s;e of the P. of <HI>Orange</HI>'s <HI>Name, Power and Interest,</HI> to bring about the Redre&s;s of <HI>their trifling Grievan|ces.</HI> That <HI>Prince</HI> they were re&s;olv'd to make but a <HI>Tool</HI> of for their little &s;elf-ends, whereof one was <HI>the utter aba&s;ing of the poor Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> and laying them at their mercy. I confe&s;s I cannot but laugh at the in&s;upportable <HI>Folly</HI> of the&s;e <HI>unthinking Creatures,</HI> that could imagine, the P. of <HI>Orange,</HI> who made &s;o great a Figure in <HI>Europe,</HI> and who&s;e pre&s;ence was of &s;o great ne|ce&s;&s;ity on the <HI>Continent,</HI> could be impos'd upon to come over to <HI>England</HI> in the heart of <HI>Winter,</HI> amid&s;t a thou&s;and <HI>Dangers,</HI> and at a va&s;t <HI>Charge,</HI> and that meerly to fa&s;ten, for&s;ooth, <HI>a tottering Pillar or two in the Cathedral of</HI> Canterbury, <HI>or the Chappel of</HI> Lambeth. That Illu&s;trious Prince was born for greater Glories than the&s;e; and tho&s;e poor Monki&s;h State&s;men are not able to fathom the <HI>Genie</HI> of a <HI>Heroe.</HI></P>
<P>No reward but that of the Crown was &s;uffi|cient for the mighty favour the Prince had done us, in delivering us from <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Slavery;</HI> And there was indeed no other means left to a&s;|&s;ure us of &s;afety, in &s;o perplexing an Event, as
<PB N="10" REF="7"> that of K. <HI>James</HI>'s going away, and the Con&s;e|quences that did attend it. But to &s;et the <HI>Crown</HI> upon the head of a <HI>Prince,</HI> who being brought up in Foreign Church, they &s;uppos'd would prove no blind Bigot to Theirs, was a thing our <HI>High Priest</HI> and the re&s;t of the <HI>Gang</HI> could not bear. A <HI>Popi&s;h Prince,</HI> &s;o be it he would grant them a high hand over the <HI>Prote|&s;tant Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> they would rather tru&s;t on the Throne, that a <HI>Prote&s;tant One,</HI> who they knew would never con&s;ent to &s;uch Practices.</P>
<P>And here I would fain know of our <HI>Lambeth Holy Club,</HI> what mighty difference there is be|twixt the Inviting a Foreign Prince to Invade by Arms the Right of their <HI>Jure Divino</HI> King (as they call King <HI>James</HI>) and thereafter Ad|dre&s;&s;ing that Prince to accept of a Power, which only belongs in their &s;en&s;e to Kings; and that of Swearing Obedience to that &s;ame Prince after he is actually Declared and Con&s;tituted King by the Nobility and Repre&s;entatives of the People? How comes it that the&s;e Gentle|men were &s;o free to do the fir&s;t, and think it &s;o unpardonable a &s;in to do the la&s;t? It's with con|ferring of Crowns, as with another Civil Con|tract, of which the Law &s;ays, <HI>Multa impediunt Ma|trimonium contrahendum, quae non de&s;truunt con|tractum:
<PB N="11" REF="7"> Many things may hinder a Marriage from being at fir&s;t entred into, which cannot di&s;&s;olve it after it's con&s;ummated.</HI> So many things might have been &s;aid to hinder the Crown from being conferred upon his Maje&s;ty, which cannot have any place now, after he is by Act of Parliament &s;etled in the Throne. And to any body, but the&s;e that are wilfully ignorant, the Inviting and A&s;&s;i&s;ting his Maje&s;ty again&s;t the late King, before the Crown was conferr'd upon him, was a greater Inva&s;ion of their darling Principle of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience,</HI> than the Swearing to him af|ter he is declared and acknowledged King by the Parliament.</P>
<P>The King and Queen being thus &s;etled on the Throne, we have immediately the effects of the&s;e mens incon&s;tancy expre&s;t in a <HI>Third Plot,</HI> whereof we are now principally to treat: Which has been managed principally by the di&s;affected Clergy and Laicks; for the Papi&s;ts have really the lea&s;t &s;hare in it. The fir&s;t &s;tep the Clergy made, was the writing <HI>against the taking the new Oaths to their Maje&s;ties, enjoyn'd them by Act of Parliament;</HI> and the buzzing in|to the Ears of their poor ignorant Votaries, the <HI>&V;nlawfulne&s;s of tho&s;e Oaths, and the conti|nuing Right of King</HI> James <HI>to the Crown.</HI></P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P>This piece of their Artillery, it was thought would have done &s;ome con&s;iderable Execution; But alas! a great many of the Gentlemen them&s;elves who had been indu&s;trious to per|&s;uade others to refu&s;e the Oaths, they could &s;o little dige&s;t the lo&s;s of their <HI>Livings,</HI> as they cho&s;e rather to take the&s;e unlawful Oaths (as they call'd them) than to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the lea&s;t Suffering. And I remember a pret|ty &s;tory of a <HI>Reverend Divine</HI> in the <HI>North</HI> on this occa&s;ion: He had damn'd to Hell in his Sermons, all that ro&s;e for King <HI>William,</HI> before he was declar'd King; and ever after he was declar'd and Crown'd, to this very day, would never pray for him: He had in all Com|panies, but more e&s;pecially among tho&s;e of his own Character, exclaim'd again&s;t the taking the Oaths, and told them over and over again, that he had rather beg than take them: His In&s;inuations, and (as they expected) his Exam|ple, prevail'd with a great many of the poor <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Curates</HI> of the Country, to let the time expire that was appointed for taking the Oaths. But the Gentleman him&s;elf, the very la&s;t night of the prefixed time, comes &s;tealing in to the Magi&s;trates of the Town where he lived, and takes them without any Scruple. But enough of this worthy Divine.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>There being very few of our di&s;affected Clergy that had the Courage to lay down their Places for the Oaths, the next &s;tep of the Plot was, to cheat the World and their own Con|&s;ciences with a ridiculous and fooli&s;h di&s;tinction of taking the Oaths to a King <HI>de facto,</HI> but not <HI>de jure.</HI> The de&s;ign of this Di&s;tinction was fir&s;t to &s;alve their own Con&s;ciences, and to vin|dicate them&s;elves from the Reproaches of their Comerades, who had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to take the Oaths. And 2ly, To bear it in up|on the minds of the people, That their Maje|&s;ties were not Lawful and Rightful King and Queen of <HI>England,</HI> but <HI>de facto</HI> only, that is, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h, Downright &V;&s;urpers.</HI> This was &s;o little adverted to, even by &s;ome of the hone&s;t Clergy, that in &s;everal of their Writings for <HI>ta|king the Oaths,</HI> they &s;eemed to grant the di&s;tincti|on; which was indeed upon the matter, a granting the Que&s;tion, tho the&s;e worthy Per|&s;ons had no ill intentions in it. And indeed what could be more efficacious to alienate the hearts of the People from Their Maje&s;ties, than either to &s;uppo&s;e them King and Queen <HI>de facto</HI> only, or to buzze into the Peoples ears, that in Swearing Allegiance to them, they thereby acknowledge no lawful Right to the
<PB N="14" REF="9"> Crown to be in their Per&s;ons. This di&s;tinction did not only give them &s;cope to take the Oaths to their Maje&s;ties, but al&s;o to pray for them <HI>by Name</HI> in their Pulpits. But yet &s;ome of them, of more &s;incerity than the re&s;t, would not pray for them by Name at all; and yet to prevent any trouble from the Law, they wi&s;ely pray'd in <HI>general Terms for the King and Queen.</HI> Here was a pretty way of playing fa&s;t and loo&s;e with God Almighty: He might take it in what &s;en&s;e he plea&s;ed; either for King <HI>James</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> or King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary:</HI> And thus both God Almighty, and the Act of Par|liament were &s;atisfied. Others of a more nice &s;tomach yet, would not pray for <HI>the King and Queen,</HI> but for <HI>the King and the Royal Family:</HI> A rare ma&s;ter-piece of wit! The word <HI>King</HI> takes in either King <HI>William</HI> or King <HI>James,</HI> and the <HI>Royal Family</HI> takes in all: And &s;o be &s;ure, the <HI>Par&s;on</HI> mu&s;t hit right one way or other.</P>
<P>The next &s;tep of the Plot was this; The Act of Parliament enjoyning the Oaths to their Maje&s;ties, it &s;eems, admits of &s;ome favoura|ble Interpretation in Law, upon the part of tho&s;e <HI>that only Preach, but have no Cure of Souls.</HI> Before they came to find out this noble Inven|tion, the Plot was lame, becau&s;e the Machines
<PB N="15" REF="9"> that moved it, were debarr'd from the Pulpits, where their Train would take be&s;t. The whi&s;|pering in Corners was only &s;mall &s;hot, but the Thunders from the Pulpit, would certainly do mighty Execution; and no fitter place to e|rect a Battery, than upon a Velvet Cu&s;hion.</P>
<P>Some wi&s;e Lawyers having found out this happy Defect in the <HI>Act</HI> of Parliament, one of the greate&s;t Champions was detach'd from the Body of the Army, to beat the Road, and try this new Experiment. And then D. <HI>S.</HI> with the loud Acclamations of the <HI>Party,</HI> mounts the Chair fir&s;t; and as an Introduction to his Ser|mons, gives his Auditory an account of the happy Di&s;covery he had made, of &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing to Mankind; <HI>as his having Liberty to Preach to them, notwith&s;tanding the Act of Par|liament about taking the Oaths.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Achilles</HI> was followed by a great num|ber of le&s;&s;er <HI>Mermidons;</HI> who partly by &s;tealth, and partly by the Pious Zeal of &s;ome of their own &s;ort of <HI>Church-Wardens,</HI> got up into &s;ome Pulpits in <HI>London,</HI> and a great many more in the Country; where they were led about in Triumph. This was a down-right Inva&s;ion on the <HI>Act of Parliament;</HI> for it was never the meaning of the <HI>Lawgivers,</HI> that only the <HI>Cure
<PB N="16" REF="10"> of Souls</HI> &s;hould fall under the compa&s;s of the <HI>Act,</HI> and that that tho&s;e who would not take the Oaths, might have leave to Preach, and thereby <HI>Trumpet up the People to a Di&s;&s;atisfa|ction with the Government.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e <HI>&s;teps</HI> of the <HI>Plot,</HI> were to be back'd with another <HI>Engine</HI> of theirs; and that was the publi&s;hing to the World, <HI>The Hi&s;tory of Pa&s;|&s;ive Obedience.</HI> In order to this <HI>Ma&s;ter-piece</HI> of Learning (for &s;o mu&s;t certainly a bare Col|lection of other Mens Writings be) a <HI>Reverend Club</HI> meets at <HI>L.</HI> where they mu&s;ter up a great many Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Divines, both Ancient and Modern, to e&s;tabli&s;h their Notion of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive-Obedience.</HI> Although the mo&s;t of the Citations of this Pamphlet, be far wide of the Que&s;tion, and refer only to Obedience to Magi&s;tracy in general, and the unlawfulne&s;s of private Per&s;ons, their ri&s;ing up again&s;t the Government upon every frivolous pretext: Yet this &s;illy <HI>Pamphlet</HI> was handed about in Triumph among the <HI>Party;</HI> and it was a Damnable Sin, for any of the <HI>Gang</HI> to want it off his Table; yet many times the Bible that lay there before for fa&s;hion, was removed to give place to this new Gue&s;t.</P>
<P>But alas! All that's pa&s;t, was but &s;mall
<PB N="17" REF="10"> drops before the Deluge of Rain that &s;ucceeded. The next Engine of the <HI>Plot</HI> is the happy Re&s;ult of a kind of <HI>Oeconomick Council</HI> of the whole Party: The Liturgy of the Church of <HI>England</HI> mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide, and a new one mu&s;t be cal|culated for the Meridian of King <HI>James</HI>'s <HI>Totter|ing Fortune:</HI> And the greate&s;t wonder of all, is, That the <HI>Council</HI> who publi&s;h'd this new Litur|gy, did not u&s;her it in with, <HI>It &s;eems good to the Holy Gho&s;t, and to us.</HI></P>
<P>In this New Liturgy they in&s;inuate to the World, That in effect, all that are for Their Maje&s;ties Intere&s;t, were <HI>without King, without Prie&s;t, and without God in the World.</HI> A dreadful Doom, before a Terrible Tribunal! None are indeed at this rate, within the compa&s;s of the Church, but this <HI>Holy Jacobite Club,</HI> and their followers. But let us hear the very Words of this part of the Liturgy; <HI>Re&s;tore us again</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>the Publick Wor&s;hip of thy Name, the Reverend Admini&s;trations of thy Sacraments; rai&s;e up the for|mer Government both in Church and State, that we may be no longer without King, without Prie&s;t, and without God in the World.</HI></P>
<P>But the loude&s;t bla&s;t of their Trumpet, we meet with, when they come to Pray for the late King <HI>James:</HI> it's here the <HI>Holy Club</HI> has ex|hau&s;ted
<PB N="18" REF="11"> all their Rhetorick and Zeal in the following Words. <HI>Send forth</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>thy Light and thy Truth, and let them pre&s;erve us. Pro|tect and defend thy Servant our Sovereign Lord the King. O prepare thy Loving Mercy and Faithfulne&s;s, that they may pre&s;erve him. Strengthen his hands, and the hands of all that are put in Authority under him, with Judgment and Ju&s;tice, to cut off all &s;uch workers of Iniquity as turn Religion to Rebellion, and Faith into Faction</HI> (a pretty gingling of the Letters, mightily conducing to the Force of the Prayer), <HI>That they may never prevail a|gain&s;t us, or triumph in the Ruin of thy Church among us. To this end defend the King, bind up his Soul in the bundle of Life, and let no Weapon form'd again&s;t him pro&s;per. Be unto him a helmet of Salvation, and a &s;trong Tower of Defence a|gain&s;t the Face of his Enemies. Let his Reign be pro&s;perous, and his Days many. Make him glad ac|cording to the Days wherein thou ha&s;t afflicted him, and for the Years wherein thou ha&s;t made him &s;uffer Adver&s;ity. Give him the Necks of his Enemies, and al&s;o every day more and more the Hearts of his Subjects. As for tho&s;e that are implacable, cloath them with &s;hame; but upon him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity</HI> (that is, the Prince of <HI>Wales) let the Crown flouri&s;h.</HI> I have been at the pains to copy out
<PB N="19" REF="11"> thus much of the Prayer, that we may there|by &s;ee in what a <HI>Praying frame</HI> the Gentlemen were, when they compos'd it: And the truth is, I do not remember we ever &s;aw them &s;o tran&s;ported with an <HI>extatick fit</HI> of Zeal, in all their Prayers for King <HI>James,</HI> when he was up|on the Throne.</P>
<P>The <HI>General Council</HI> having thus compos'd this new Liturgy, there were above 10000 of them printed and di&s;per&s;ed up and down among the Party. And to this very day they u&s;e them in their <HI>Cabals,</HI> laying a&s;ide a great part, and &s;ometimes all the old Liturgy: For alas! the old Liturgy comes not up to the heat and zeal of this new one; and how many old Women are become very devout upon it, that had almo&s;t been worn out of all love for the Old one, many years ago; e&s;pecially if they have any little odd Money to &s;pare to the poor di&s;tre&s;t Clergy, that have left their places for pure Con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>Now at the very time the great Guns of the&s;e new Prayers are thus furiou&s;ly playing, the <HI>Club</HI> are working a Mine under ground, to widen the Breach, in order to a <HI>General A&s;&s;ault.</HI> There are a great many of King <HI>James</HI>'s Of|ficers, and other well-wi&s;hers about Town,
<PB N="20" REF="12"> that mu&s;t be taken care of, until things be rea|dy for a final In&s;urrection, wherein there will be u&s;e for them. To this effect, there are &s;o many of the <HI>Holy Club</HI> detach'd up and down, to per&s;uade monied People, who wi&s;h well to the Cau&s;e, to contribute for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the&s;e ca&s;hier'd Gentlemen. There are no in|con&s;iderable Sums of Money Levied and Paid out upon that account; among the Colle|ctors of which, there mu&s;t be one Fellow that eat King <HI>William</HI>'s Bread. And certainly it were worth the while, to be pre&s;ent at one of the Meetings of the General <HI>L.</HI> Club, to hear what extraordinary fine Per&s;ons they extend their Care and Charity to, upon this account; and to learn the little Arts the&s;e great State&s;men, put in practice, to per&s;uade the &s;illy old Women to tell down their Du&s;t, for carrying on &s;o pious a Work.</P>
<P>But now I come to the main Points of this noble Contrivance, and it may indeed be cal|led <HI>The Plot</HI> by way of Eminence; all that went before, being but an Introduction to it. His Maje&s;ty, from a Noble and Boundle&s;s Cou|rage, will needs venture his Per&s;on once more for the &s;afety of the&s;e Kingdoms, and His Journey to <HI>Ireland</HI> is concluded upon: In or|der
<PB N="21" REF="12"> to this Expedition, the mo&s;t and the bet|ter Di&s;ciplin'd part of the Army are to attend His Maje&s;ty; And it will be impo&s;&s;ible to leave any con&s;iderable Force behind him in his ab&s;ence. Like as the Tran&s;portation of the Queen of <HI>Spain;</HI> and the Convoy of the <HI>Streights</HI> Merchant-men, had carried a con&s;i|derable part of our Fleet to the <HI>Mediterranian:</HI> And another part of it was to attend His Maje|&s;ty and the Army to <HI>Ireland:</HI> So that our Fleet was not to be &s;o con&s;iderable, as otherwi&s;e it would have been.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Circum&s;tances rai&s;ed the Courage of our <HI>Plotters;</HI> and now was the only and fit|te&s;t time to <HI>give the blow:</HI> In order to which, their mighty Patron the <HI>French King</HI> mu&s;t be induc'd to act a con&s;iderable, and in effect, the mo&s;t dangerous part. They knew, that his own Intere&s;t was linked intirely with that of King <HI>James</HI>'s; and that it concerned as much the <HI>French</HI> King in this Juncture, to &s;up|port King <HI>James,</HI> and to maintain a War again&s;t King <HI>William</HI> in his own Kingdoms, as if the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf were at the &s;take. The <HI>French</HI> King, from long cu&s;tom, knew how to improve his Gold in <HI>England</HI> to advan|tage, and many a con&s;iderable return had he
<PB N="22" REF="13"> made of that &s;ort of trade. Our Plotters know be&s;t the <HI>Genius</HI> of the People; and where to be&s;tow this Gold to the be&s;t advantage. They had been well acquainted with all the Villanies and Treacheries of the la&s;t two Reigns; becau&s;e &s;ome of them had a con&s;ide|rable &s;hare in them: And they wi&s;ely con&s;i|dered, that if they, by &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Gold, could gain Offices or Places, to tho&s;e of their own Party, then they would be Ma&s;ters of all the Secrets of the Nation: And it &s;hould be their own fault if they improved not the Intel|ligence they might have from them, to the forwarding King <HI>James</HI>'s affairs.</P>
<P>It was not only Places and Offices, <HI>wherein Intelligence is properly to be had,</HI> but even tho&s;e in the <HI>Fleet</HI> and el&s;ewhere, our Plotters ex|pected to have men of their own Stamp put in, with their Gold: And whether they fail'd in the la&s;t or not, I cannot tell; &s;ure if they did, it was not for want of Pains or Money, for they &s;par'd neither.</P>
<P>The King being gone; <HI>Admiral Killigrew</HI> being in the Streights; and Sir <HI>Clou&s;ely Shouel</HI> in St. <HI>George</HI>'s <HI>Channel;</HI> And the <HI>Holland Squa|dron</HI> not yet joyn'd ours, nor <HI>ours</HI> fully met: Then was the time for our <HI>Plotters</HI> to put
<PB N="23" REF="13"> their long thought on de&s;ign in Execution. In order to which, at one of their <HI>General Meetings</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> where it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome of the <HI>Clergy</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ent to Ble&s;s &s;o Pious a Work; it was concluded to give in a <HI>Memorial</HI> in Name of <HI>the Loyal and Di&s;tre&s;s'd Subjects of England</HI> (for &s;o they nam'd them&s;elves) to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty; Humbly Inviting him out of his extraordinary Goodne&s;s, and for the Affection he always bore to oppre&s;t Virtue, That he would a&s;&s;i&s;t them in re&s;toring Their lawful King, His Ancient Ally and Confede|rate, to his Throne; and in breaking the Yoak of U&s;urpation, under which the&s;e Three Nati|ons were at this time &s;o heavily Groaning. But it will be ab&s;olutely fit here to in&s;ert the very Words of their Memorial it &s;elf, as it has been di&s;cover'd by a certain Per&s;on of late, and as it was expre&s;t in the <HI>French</HI> Tongue, in which it was Originally written, and given in.</P>

<P>The MEMORIAL is thus:

<HEAD>To the Mo&s;t Serene and Mo&s;t Invincible Prince, <HI>Lewis</HI> the Great, His Mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty; The Memorial of the Loyal and Di&s;tre&s;t Noblemen, Clergy, Gentlemen, and others, of all Ranks, within the Kingdoms of <HI>England, Scot|land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> at pre&s;ent under the Fetters of a Cruel U&s;urpation.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Great and Invincible Monarch,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Re&s;plended Rays of Your Maje&s;ties Virtues, have render'd all the World your Adorers: And that Inherent Goodne&s;s of which Your Maje&s;ty &s;tands &s;o tran&s;cendently po&s;&s;e&s;t, does ren|der You the only Sanctuary of all the di&s;tre&s;t. It's in the Confidence which this Your Unparallel'd Good|ne&s;s gives us, That we in all humble Duty, pre&s;ume to lay our Sighs at Your Maje&s;ties Feet: And that we Implore Your Royal Favour and A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to rid us out of the great and in&s;upportable Afflictions we lye under at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It's in your Royal Arms and Bounty we repo&s;e our Hope and Confidence; and expect to &s;ee Our Lawful King, Your Ancient Friend and Ally, re|&s;tor'd
<PB N="25" REF="14"> to the rightful Throne of his Ance&s;tors, out of which wicked men have thru&s;t him. And becau&s;e this is the most proper time for your Maje&s;ty to a&s;&s;i&s;t us with the a&s;&s;ured expectation of &s;ucce&s;s, we have pre&s;um'd to lay before you the pre&s;ent favourable Circum&s;tances, that do concur to make your Maje|&s;ties glorious Enterprize the more ea&s;ie; which are principally the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> The Prince of Orange, the U&s;urper, is ju&s;t now on his journey to <HI>Ireland;</HI> And being once ar|riv'd in that Kingdom, if a part of Your Maje&s;ties Fleet were able to block up St. <HI>George's</HI> Channel, the U&s;urper's Army would certainly be starv'd, being that all their Provi&s;ions come by Sea from <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> And that that part of the Countrey they are Ma&s;ters of, is already hara&s;s'd and ruin'd by both Armies, both the la&s;t year and this.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> The U&s;urper has partly &s;ent before, and part|ly takes along with him&s;elf, the whole, almo&s;t, and the better Di&s;ciplin'd part of the Army: And leaves behind him but a very few of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regiments; who &s;erve him more out of nece&s;&s;ity and fear, than out of any Love to him, or to the Intere&s;t.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> The Forces he leaves behind, are &s;o very few, that they are &s;carce capable to keep Guards in the <HI>Tower,</HI> the <HI>Savoy, Somer&s;et-Hou&s;e</HI> and at <HI>White-Hall</HI> all together: And the three Regiments,
<PB N="26" REF="15"> that are &s;ent for out of <HI>Holland,</HI> will not be yet ready for &s;ome weeks to embark; neither is it thought they will &s;tir a foot, becau&s;e of want of Pay. Likeas both Officers and Soldiers are not entirely Devoted to the U&s;urpers Intere&s;t, the mo&s;t of them being in the Service of our Lawful King, before he was nece&s;&s;itated to leave us.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Most of our Fleet are at &s;o great di&s;tance one from another, that they cannot this year make any con|&s;iderable body. There being the be&s;t and able&s;t Seamen and Ships with <HI>Killegrew</HI> in the <HI>Streights,</HI> and with <HI>Shouel</HI> in St. <HI>George's</HI> Channel, amount|ing together to more than Nineteen Ships of War.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> There are likewi&s;e imploy'd for Convoys, and about the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> Coa&s;ts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to the num|ber of <HI>5</HI> or <HI>6</HI> Ships, all &s;eparately.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadron is in no appearance to be here to join ours of a &s;udden; both becau&s;e they are not yet in a readine&s;s, and that the Admirals of <HI>Holland</HI> make &s;cruple, and are highly di&s;contented to &s;erve under our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral. Moreover, tho they were join'd us, they will but make up at the mo&s;t twenty Sail of Ships; and them none of the be&s;t, con&s;idering their talle&s;t and be&s;t mann'd Ships are out upon Convoys.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> Our own Fleet is very ill mann'd, and the Sol|diers and Seamen extremely di&s;contented for want of
<PB N="27" REF="15"> their Pay; and &s;everal of the Officers were tho&s;e that belonged to our King before he went away.</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>There are <HI>Five</HI> more <HI>Articles</HI> in this <HI>Memorial,</HI> that for certain Rea&s;ons I will not Copy out; only I'll tell the Reader, they are of a piece with the re&s;t, and full as ill. Here are &s;ome truths, but a great many more lyes; and &s;uch as none but People of their gang could be capable of. And if the Readers Cu|rio&s;ity tempt him to be very inqui&s;itive how this <HI>Memorial</HI> came to light; let him wait but a little, and perhaps he will &s;ee both it, and the <HI>Deliverers</HI> and <HI>Contrivers</HI> of it, made publick enough.</P>
<P>It might be thought &s;trange, that this <HI>Gene|ral Council</HI> &s;hould venture their Credit, to in|vite the <HI>French</HI> King over to <HI>England</HI> upon no better or &s;urer grounds; for by the by, the De|&s;ign of the Memorial, was to bring them over, and there had been &s;ome two or three other Memorials before this, over and above a con|&s;tant Corre&s;pondence betwixt the <HI>French</HI> Mi|ni&s;ter <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Croi&s;ie,</HI> and them. But the very truth is, The <HI>Clergy,</HI> who were the great Contrivers and Managers of this, and who by their Profe&s;&s;ion are for the mo&s;t part extra|ordinarily
<PB N="28" REF="16"> credulous of any thing they incline to, did really believe, that immediately upon the appearing of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and the burn|ing of ours (which they thought as &s;ure) there would certainly be a general <HI>In&s;urrecti|on</HI> through a great many places of the King|dom, in order to join them at their Landing, and to Declare for King <HI>James.</HI> They knew how bu&s;ie they them&s;elves had been to buzze into the ears of all People they had any Inte|re&s;t with, jealou&s;ies of the Government; and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of calling back a Prince, that was by an unalterable <HI>Divine Right,</HI> their King. They knew how bu&s;ie they had been in every corner, to whi&s;per the great and heavy Taxes the Kingdom lay under in this Reign; and how greatly Trade was decay'd of late. When in the mean time the&s;e Wretches were Con&s;ci|ous to them&s;elves, That we had given more to King <HI>Charles</HI> to throw away upon his Whores, than we had given to King <HI>William</HI> to reduce <HI>Ireland</HI> to the Crown of <HI>England.</HI> They likewi&s;e knew, that the Di&s;&s;enters had been of late a little di&s;oblig'd by the continu|ing the <HI>Sacramental Te&s;t,</HI> and by the 500 <HI>l. Bill;</HI> and &s;ome other things that &s;eem'd very hard, con&s;idering their hearty affection to
<PB N="29" REF="16"> King <HI>William</HI>'s Intere&s;t. They knew that &s;ome of the mo&s;t moderate part of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> called <HI>Whigs,</HI> had met with &s;ome mor|tifications of late, in the <HI>Elections for Parlia|ment,</HI> but more e&s;pecially in the <HI>change of the Lieu|tenancy of London.</HI> They were al&s;o pretty well acquainted with the temper of &s;ome men in Of|fices both in the <HI>Lieutenancy</HI> and <HI>Militia,</HI> who had gone a con&s;iderable length in the high-flown cour&s;es of the late Reign: And they were ea&s;ily induc'd to think, that they who had gone the greate&s;t length in betraying the Liberties of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and in <HI>packing up Juries,</HI> and the like, could never be cordial Friends to the pre&s;ent <HI>Government.</HI> All which things prevail'd with the&s;e new kind of <HI>State&s;men,</HI> to believe, that a <HI>general In&s;urrection</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> was one of the ea&s;ie&s;t things of a thou&s;and; con&s;idering the Ab&s;ence of the King, and &s;ome other things mentioned in the <HI>Memorial.</HI> But they counted without their ho&s;t; and whether out of fear, or want of Power, none of the Male-contents of <HI>England</HI> dur&s;t &s;tir a foot in the Cau&s;e they wi&s;h'd &s;o well to.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King giving ear to the <HI>Repre&s;en|tations</HI> and <HI>Importunities</HI> of the&s;e Gentlemen, put all his Wit on the rack to get money to equip
<PB N="30" REF="17"> the greate&s;t <HI>Fleet</HI> that ever that Nation &s;et to Sea; and at a va&s;t charge he brought the <HI>Thou|lon Squadron</HI> round the whole Continent of <HI>Spain,</HI> and through the <HI>Streights,</HI> to join his <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> Fleet. He left not behind, one Seaman that could be found in <HI>France,</HI> and &s;carce one Ship more of any Force, in all his <HI>Harbours.</HI> Upon the notice given him by his Tru&s;ty <HI>Pen|&s;ioners</HI> here, he directs this <HI>French Armado</HI> &s;traight for the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> where our Fleet was to rendezvous; and if it had but arrived there &s;ome few days before it came, we had not had Twenty Ships together at that place: Yet &s;o near were we to ruin, that albeit our Fleet was become by that time pretty &s;trong, and the mo&s;t of the Ships arriv'd; yet if Heaven had not turned the Wind in a moment, they had every one of them, in all probability, been burn'd at Anchor. The <HI>French</HI> Fleet pa&s;|&s;ing in &s;ight of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> the <HI>Mayor</HI> of that place did very wi&s;ely di&s;patch two Expre&s;&s;es, one for the Queen, and another for my <HI>Lord Torrington,</HI> the Admiral: But the Wind blow|ing a fair fre&s;h Gale, the <HI>French</HI> Fleet had certainly been amid&s;t ours, before the <HI>Wey|mouth</HI> Expre&s;s could po&s;&s;ibly reach <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> if the Wind had continued but &s;ome hours
<PB N="31" REF="17"> longer. Our Fleet being in this imminent, and almo&s;t inevitable hazard, and the <HI>French</HI> being within a few Leagues of them, the Wind in an in&s;tant turn'd about, and put a &s;top to their de&s;ign'd and ea&s;ie Victory, by obliging them to lye by.</P>
<P>This happy Providence counter-acted all the Plots of our Enemies both at Home and Abroad; and we had time given us to prevent the De&s;truction that threatned us. And to compleat the Mercy, it fell out, that at that very preci&s;e time this hapned, there was a full Di&s;covery made by &s;ome Per&s;ons here, who had been concerned in the Plot all along, of their whole Affairs and Tran&s;actions both with <HI>France,</HI> and at Home.</P>
<P>We read of one of the Nations of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that when any &s;ignal Misfortune befals their State, they immediately thereupon offer up to their angry Deities &s;ome of their Prie&s;ts, as a Sacrifice to atone their Wrath; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, <HI>Tho&s;e Prie&s;ts ought to have taught us how to have plea&s;ed the Gods, &s;o as not to provoke them to inflict &s;uch judgments upon us.</HI> The truth is, it's a wonder the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, upon the af|front that has befallen them, in being forc'd to turn their backs to the <HI>French</HI> at Sea, have
<PB N="32" REF="18"> not in their fury <HI>De-Witted</HI> &s;ome of tho&s;e men who have brought all this upon us, both by Inviting the <HI>French,</HI> and by the Intreagues they have manag'd at home: And I mu&s;t tell them, that the Crimes of the Two unhappy Brothers in <HI>Holland</HI> (which gave ri&s;e to that word) were not fully &s;o great, as tho&s;e of &s;ome of them; and yet their Puni&s;hment has been one of the &s;evere&s;t that any Criminals ever met with in this Age.</P>
<P>I am very inclinable to believe, that all the Officers and Seamen of the Fleet have been Proof again&s;t the In&s;inuations of our <HI>Plotters;</HI> and that they have not yielded to the Tem|ptations of <HI>French</HI> Gold; tho at the &s;ame time, I do not doubt, they have been a&s;&s;aulted with both: And if &s;o, the wonder is the greater, if it be true, that is talked &s;o freely up and down, That a great many of the Officers have bought their Places with money. It's hard to believe that there are any &s;uch practi|ces in <HI>England,</HI> as the buying and &s;elling Places, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the <HI>Fleet,</HI> upon which de|pend both the Saftety and Glory of <HI>England:</HI> But if any &s;uch thing be, then the <HI>Retreat</HI> we have been forc'd to make, will certainly open the eyes of our Governous, to &s;ee the mighty
<PB N="33" REF="18"> and almo&s;t irrecoverable prejudices that attend &s;uch &s;lavi&s;h methods of getting Commands; and will put them upon employing fit Per|&s;ons, in <HI>who&s;e Fidelity and Valour we may &s;afely tru&s;t.</HI> Altho I be far from vindicating the late <HI>U&s;urpation</HI> of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> yet I cannot but admire the choice he made of brave and skilful Com|manders in the <HI>Fleet;</HI> under the conduct of whom, <HI>England</HI> got &s;o much Glory in the War again&s;t the <HI>Dutch:</HI> Over and above their Va|lour and Skill, Tho&s;e Commanders both in their Practice and by their Orders, kept up the &s;tricte&s;t Di&s;cipline among their Soldiers; and if there was any immoralities committed among&s;t them, it was by &s;tealth, and not in face of the Sun. It's to be confe&s;s'd, it's very hard for &s;ome men to re&s;i&s;t the Temptations of deprav'd Nature, and they are to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure pitied, when they do it in a manner that expre&s;&s;es their &s;hame of it. But when men commit the gro&s;&s;e&s;t immoralities in the open view of the world; it is in it &s;elf an outbraving of God Almighty, and a virtual denying of his Ju&s;tice, or of his Power to ex|ert it. And it's &s;trange how any can dare to expect &s;ucce&s;s from Heaven, when they are openly declaring War again&s;t it, by their
<PB N="34" REF="19"> avowed Impieties. And I am afraid, we wait for Succe&s;s in vain, as long as in our Ar|mies and Navies, among our Officers and Sol|diers, there is not a Reformation, at lea&s;t of open Immoralities.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>French</HI> Expedition: Our Murmurers and Plotters were &s;trangely eleva|ted with the expectation of its Succe&s;s. In their fond imaginations King <HI>James</HI> was al|ready at <HI>White-Hall;</HI> and &s;ome of them were publickly in Coffee-hou&s;es acting the part of a Herauld, in Mar&s;halling his Triumphant en|try into <HI>London.</HI> Never was our new Liturgies, I &s;poke of, &s;o threadbare as now, with being &s;o often &s;aid over and over again in private meet|ings of the Party: And the ordinary &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e was, the <HI>Greatne&s;s and Magnani|mity of the</HI> French <HI>King, the number and force of his Fleet, the weakne&s;s of ours;</HI> and &s;ometimes a <HI>defect of His Maje&s;ties forces in Ireland,</HI> to keep them in heart. Their Impudence was arriv'd at that height, that in <HI>open Exchange,</HI> one of the long Robe was plea&s;ed to &s;ay with relation to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lo&s;s in the late Engagement at Sea, That <HI>they were well paid off for the Pre&s;ent they had &s;ent us &s;ome twenty months ago.</HI></P>
<P>But that none of that Party may want the
<PB N="35" REF="19"> due Prai&s;e their Writings de&s;erve, I'll give the Reader a <HI>Dedication</HI> made by one of them (and him of the long Robe too) to the <HI>French</HI> King not many Months &s;ince, when the Plot was ju&s;t upon the wheel, and which for the Noblene&s;s of the &s;tile I mu&s;t commend, tho the matter of it be downright Bla&s;phemy. <HI>Immortalitati &amp; Alternitati, Nominis &amp; Numinis Lodovici Magni, Galliarum Imperatoris, Clementis, Victoris, Felicis, &s;emper Augu&s;ti, ob Egregiam Pie|tatem &amp; Regiam muni&s;icentiam, erga Afflictos Principes Brittannicos, nomine Brittaniarum In&s;u|larum,</HI> ho&s;ce Ver&s;iculos Anglice <HI>con&s;criptos, humillime con&s;ecrat.</HI> In <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thus; <HI>To the Im|mortality and Eternity of the Name and Divinity of</HI> Lewis <HI>the Great Emperor of</HI> France, <HI>Victorious, Happy, Merciful, Allwi&s;e, Augu&s;t; in acknowledge|ment of his Royal goodne&s;s and bounty towards the af|flicted Princes of</HI> Brittain, <HI>The&s;e Ver&s;es Written in</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>are in name of the</HI> Britti&s;h <HI>I&s;les mo&s;t humbly Con&s;ecratated by,</HI> &amp;c. Thus we &s;ee how far an <HI>Engli&s;h Jacobite</HI> can outvy a <HI>French</HI> Poet him&s;elf, in the art of <HI>Bla&s;phemous Flattery.</HI></P>
<P>But how &s;oon are all the&s;e kind of Peoples hopes laid in the du&s;t, upon the arrival of the news of His Maje&s;tis Glorious Victories in <HI>Ireland?</HI> and how far has it counterpois'd the
<PB N="36" REF="20"> joy they had &s;ome days ago for the Action be|tween the two Fleets? A little time will &s;hew, that notwith&s;tanding of all they have done to Ruin him, no body will be more forward than they to fawn upon his Maje&s;ties good Fortune, whenever once they are quite out of hopes of King <HI>James</HI>'s retrieving his. But &s;ure the Government will be Wi&s;er, than ever to dart any of its warm beams upon &s;uch kind of Creatures, any farther than to let them live the Scorn of all Hone&s;t men, and the Ha|tred of every one that loves their Countrey and their Religion.</P>
<P>Thus have I given &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons of the late Di&s;a&s;ters (if I may call them &s;o) which we have met with, within the&s;e few days in <HI>England,</HI> tho they are more than made up by our wonderful Succe&s;s in <HI>Ireland;</HI> yet I mu&s;t call it a Di&s;a&s;ter, to be obliged to retire without obtaining a full Victory over the <HI>French,</HI> and to &s;ee the <HI>Dutch</HI> Squadron receive &s;o great a Damage, without being able to come up to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance. And the con&s;i|deration of this, has forc'd from me &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Authors and Abettors of the&s;e Misfortunes, that perhaps I would otherwi&s;e have &s;pared: And I atte&s;t God to
<PB N="37" REF="20"> witne&s;s, that nothing but Love to my Coun|try and Religion, to then Maje&s;ties Per&s;ons and Government, has extorted them from me.</P>
<P>When I have &s;poken &s;o much again&s;t the Practices of our di&s;contented Clergy; both Rea&s;on, and my own Inclination, do oblige me to admire and prai&s;e the wi&s;e and pious Con|duct of that part of the Clergy who have been true to their Country, and to their Religion, and have not (as &s;ome others of their Chara|cter) re&s;i&s;ted the Mercies of God, that has been wonderfully manife&s;ted in delivering us from Popery and Slavery; but who by their Precepts and Example, have excited their People to receive the&s;e Mercies with all the ju&s;t return of thanks. God forbid, that I &s;hould be &s;o unhappy, as to be mi&s;taken in any of the Reflections I have been obliged to make of the Carriage of &s;ome of that Order; or, that I &s;hould be thought to derogate in the lea&s;t from the &s;ingular Learning, Piety, and Zeal, that &s;hine vi&s;ibly among the Divines of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by any thing I have &s;aid again&s;t tho&s;e, who are indeed a reproach to that Church. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, there is one thing that has mightily provoked me again&s;t the&s;e Male contents, and that is, their veno|mous
<PB N="38" REF="21"> and ill-natur'd Reflections, both in their Di&s;cour&s;es and <HI>Libels,</HI> again&s;t &s;ome of the fir&s;t Luminaries of the Church, who&s;e Books they are not worthy to bear; and that meerly upon the account of their Affection to the pre&s;ent Government. And altho the&s;e Reverend and Excellent Per&s;ons, are plea&s;ed by a Miracle of good Nature, to &s;uffer their Follies and Im|pertinencies; I know no rea&s;on why others, that have not the Honour to be of that Sacred Order, &s;hould &s;pare them.</P>
