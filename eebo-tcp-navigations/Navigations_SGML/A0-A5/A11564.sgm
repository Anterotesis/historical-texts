But within the cytie are nearehande &s;onke and broken all the hou&s;es, and &s;ome folke pery&s;hed. The churches &amp; greate how&s;es are all fallen to the grounde. The people that was lefte in lyfe dyd crye Mi&s;ericorde with greate chatte|rynge of tethe, by rea&s;on of the feare, and ranne out of the citie into a moras grounde, where we were fledde al&s;o with oure oo&s;te and his hou&s;holde.</P>
<P>Helas for pitie, there was &s;o pytiefull an outcrye and howlynge of men and women, as I neuer dyd heare all the dayes of my lyfe. Muche people dyd lye be&s;yde the &s;tones and timber, which coulde not be holpe for feare: whether &s;ome dyd ronne to them, that can not I
<PB REF="4"> tell: For I can not fully wryte vnto you of the horrible puni&s;hment and ad+uerti&s;ement of God.</P>
<P>Farthermore dyd there ry&s;e at the &s;ame houre yet .vj. earthquakes more the one after the other, whiche were &s;o horryble at the fyr&s;t, that the earth dyd &s;o &s;hake, as though it wolde haue ope|ned it &s;elfe, and &s;walowed vs all. It was &s;o calme wether, that one leafe of the trees dyd not moue. The &s;kye was &s;o darck and black, that I for my part dyd wayte for the clerynge therof euery twynckelynge of an eye. Summa eue|ry thynge was muche more, and more horrible, than I can euer de&s;cribe vnto you. Neuerthele&s;&s;e God gaue grace, that the darckene&s;&s;e voyded, and the daye came agayne, the wynde began al&s;o to blowe agayne: wherfore we were glad and lauded and thanked God, which had &s;o gracyou&s;ly &s;hewed his mercy to vs.</P>

<P>After that dyd we ryde to Florence, our Lorde be mercyfull vnto vs: for I beleue &s;urelye that I haue in dede &s;ene an example of the domes daye. The town hath yet left foure hundreth and twenty heerthes or places for fyre.</P>
<P>Good Lord what a pitieful cryenge and callynge vppon God was herde there. To burne a towne is not to be compared by this dolorous chaunce. God our Lorde graunte vnto vs all his mercy, that we maye by this earth|quake amende and conuerte vs to his glory, and oure &s;oules health. Amen.</P>
<P>Lyke earthquakes haue ben at Florence, and in all tho&s;e countryes, but they haue not done &s;o great hurtes &s;aue onely that they haue ouerthrowen many chymenies. This haue I written vnto you in hay&s;te, bycau&s;e the Po&s;t coulde not tarye.</P>
