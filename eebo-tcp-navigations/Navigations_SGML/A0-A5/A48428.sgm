<P>Would not one think it very &s;trange a Decimal Fraction divided by a Decimal Fraction, &s;hould bring forth a whole Number in the Quotient. But I &s;hall make it very plain, that it mu&s;t be &s;o and no otherways, by a rea&s;onable De|mon&s;tration.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="13">
<P>By the fir&s;t Example, you &s;ee I di|vide .900 by .05, and the Quotient I find to be 18.0, that is, becau&s;e there is three Decimals in the Dividend and one in the Divi&s;or, I make up the number of tho&s;e in the Dividend, by taking one Decimal from the Quotient, and adding to the 2 in the Divi&s;or.</P>
<P>Now the nature of the Que&s;tion is thus: I de&s;ire to know how many times 5 Seconds in 9 Primes? The An&s;wer is 18. For there is 18 times 5 Seconds in 9 Primes.</P>
<P>If it fall out at any time, that there is not &s;o many Figures in the Quotient, as will make the&s;e in the Divi&s;or equal in Number to tho&s;e in the Dividend; then you mu&s;t prepone Cyphers before the Quotient to the left hand, as in the following Example.</P>

<P>I &s;hall give you an Example as to the U&s;e and Application of Divi&s;ion of Decimal Fractions, to the end that tho&s;e who intend to u&s;e Decimals may the better under&s;tand what they are go|ing about.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I were to divide 10 &s;hillings among&s;t 20 Men, the Decimal for 10 &s;hillings is .50; therefore I divide my Decimal .50 by the number of Men 20, and the Quotient will be .025, which is the Decimal equal to 6 pence; for if you multiply .025 by 12, and double the Product, it will be 6 pence.</P>
<P>I could give &s;everal Examples of this kind, but the various Examples that will happen in the following work, will in its proper place, give a clearer De|mon&s;tration than can be here expected; &s;o I &s;hall refer the Learner to the prac|tice in General, and proceed to my in|tended work.</P>

<P>Here we find the thickne&s;s of the Main-ma&s;t of the propounded Ship to be 27 foot; now to find the thickne&s;s or length of the other Ma&s;ts of the &s;ame Ship.</P>
<P>If for the Thickne&s;s of any of the Ma&s;ts, you mu&s;t it work by the foregoing Rule, taking out the length of the Ma&s;t you require from the foregoing Table; and as the length there requires &s;o much, what will the length found require?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t find your lengths of the &s;e|veral Ma&s;ts and Yards by the Rule be|fore directed.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e I was to find the length of the Fore-ma&s;t, having the length of the Main-ma&s;t; I multiply the length of the Main-ma&s;t by 8, and divides the Product by 9, and the Quotient is the length of the Fore-ma&s;t required.</P>
<PB N="43" REF="28">
<P>As for Example, the length of my Main-ma&s;t is 81 Foot, the which I multiply by 8, and divides by 9, and the Quotient is 72, the length of the Fore-ma&s;t &s;ought.</P>
<P>Now, if you would have the length of the Mizon-ma&s;t, being that it is &frac34; the length of the Fore-ma&s;t; you mu&s;t multiply the length of the Fore-ma&s;t by 3, and divide the Product by 4, and the Quotient is the length of the Mizon-ma&s;t; the Fore-Yard is in proportion to the Main-yard, as the Fore-ma&s;t is in proportion to the Main-ma&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus we have in&s;erted mo&s;t material things as to a Ships Rigging: but be|cau&s;e the way here in&s;erted will be trouble&s;ome and tedious, unle&s;s to &s;ome Arti&s;ts who take plea&s;ure therein, we &s;hall &s;et down a plain and ea&s;y way, by which any Ship may be Rigg'd with a great deal of ea&s;e: And &s;hall be as fol|lows.</P>
