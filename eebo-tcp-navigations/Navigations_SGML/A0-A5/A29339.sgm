<HEAD>THE AMBITION OF FRANCE UPON EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>IT is no difficult thing to di&s;cern the Original of tho&s;e Mi&s;eries under which we labour at this day: They who will give them|&s;elves the Trouble to reflect upon the Tran&s;actions, which have been the mo&s;t remarkable for the&s;e <HI>Twen|ty</HI> years la&s;t pa&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> will agree with me, that if we had been &s;o <HI>for|tunate</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="5"> to have <HI>grown wife by our Suf|ferings,</HI> we &s;hould not have &s;een our &s;elves reduc'd to tho&s;e <HI>Calamities</HI> un|der which we now groan. For in &s;hort this is not the fir&s;t time, that <HI>France</HI> has been known to have bro|ken Leagues, tho never &s;o &s;acred and inviolable. Her Ambition has not been able to keep her &s;elf re&s;erv'd without appearing in her <HI>Colours.</HI> But we have been either &s;o weak or &s;o blind, as never to make a vigo|rous oppo&s;ition till it was too late. Therefore we can only impute our <HI>Misfortunes</HI> to our &s;elves, and mu&s;t ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;s, that if we &s;uf|fer at this day the puni&s;hment of our <HI>Imprudence,</HI> 'tis no more than what we ju&s;tly de&s;erve.</P>
<P>In a word, to whom ought we to impute the <HI>Imbecillity</HI> of the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="5"> but to our &s;elves, who have &s;o often contributed to reduce them to their pre&s;ent condition? Was it not ea&s;y for us to &s;ee, that they &s;up|ported them&s;elves only by the <HI>means</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Cabals,</HI> that were maintain'd in <HI>France</HI> again&s;t Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> and that if the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> had for&s;aken their <HI>Intere&s;t,</HI> their good <HI>Fortune</HI> and <HI>Reputation</HI> had been at an end? neverthele&s;s when we ob&s;er|ved, that we had lo&s;t the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of that Prince, who was return'd to his Duty by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Peace, and that <HI>France</HI> to the prejudice of a League &s;o &s;acredly ratify'd, forbore not however, not only to foment the <HI>Troubles</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> but al&s;o to &s;end con&s;iderable Supplys to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance at &s;everal times; I &s;ay, when we &s;aw, that the <HI>Peace</HI> was
<PB N="4" REF="6"> no more than a Cloak for <HI>France</HI>'s Ambition, have we not &s;uffer'd the Oppre&s;&s;ion of our Neighbours, without &s;o much as opening our Lips, as if <HI>True Policy</HI> had not taught us, that it was time to oppo&s;e the <HI>De&s;igns</HI> of a <HI>Nation,</HI> which would never be contented, 'till &s;he had &s;atisfy'd her <HI>Ambition</HI> by the <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> of the World?</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, with what confi|dence, if I may not call it Impu|dence, did &s;he maintain, that &s;he acted nothing but what was confor|mable to the Peace? Did not &s;he likewi&s;e in&s;inuate, that whatever was done in the behalf of <HI>Portugal,</HI> was done without her Order? To which purpo&s;e while &s;he covertly &s;ent Supplys of Men and Money into that Kingdom, &s;he publi&s;h'd
<PB N="5" REF="6"> her &s;tricte&s;t Prohibitions to prevent the <HI>Tran&s;portation</HI> of <HI>Arms</HI> thither, yet underhand encourag'd her Sub|jects to carry &s;upplys to that <HI>Crown,</HI> as the only means to purcha&s;e E|&s;teem and Reputation; yet all this while carry'd fair with the <HI>Emba&s;&s;a|dor,</HI> who made loud complaints of the&s;e Breaches, e&s;pecially when he &s;aw that the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Beauveau</HI> had permi&s;&s;ion to levy a Regiment of <HI>Cavalry</HI> for the Service of that <HI>Crown</HI> in the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> ju&s;t under his No&s;e; after he had Arti|cl'd to outward appearance with the <HI>Portugal</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, but in re|ality with the <HI>Court</HI> of <HI>France.</HI> After all which proceedings &s;he would needs have it, that whatever the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador &s;aid, was but the effect of his Fancy and Imagi|nation;
<PB N="6" REF="7"> as now at this very time &s;he would make us believe that &s;he has no De&s;ign to make a War, tho &s;he has eaten up a <HI>Country</HI> within the&s;e few Months, to which &s;he has no Right at all, and to which &s;he has not the lea&s;t of Lawful Pre|tences, if <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> were the Rule of her Actions.</P>
<P>All this while, though we have ob&s;erv'd all along the&s;e Practi&s;es of <HI>France,</HI> without the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition, yet neither do we make any ad|vantage of them at this day, that we &s;ee our &s;elves ju&s;t ready to be made the <HI>Unfortunate Victims</HI> of Her <HI>Ambition.</HI> 'Tis true I know there are &s;everal who will reply that <HI>Suc|cours</HI> have been &s;ent to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which if it were done, we are be|holding to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who
<PB N="7" REF="7"> having a deeper <HI>Fore-&s;ight</HI> than o|thers, could not &s;uffer us to be over|whelm'd, without doing at lea&s;t what was his <HI>Duty</HI> to do; which is the rea&s;on we find him &s;o firmly bent again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;ecutions</HI> and <HI>In|juries</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> which e&s;teems not Vertue, but when it agrees with Her Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>But to return to the bu&s;ine&s;s, I &s;ay that <HI>France</HI> endeavour'd to blear the Eyes of the <HI>Spani&s;h Emba&s;&s;ador,</HI> who had in mind however to hunt the wrong Deer, when an unex|pected <HI>Accident</HI> made her act with more <HI>boldne&s;s,</HI> and forbear any lon|ger to di&s;gui&s;e her Thoughts. She had treated with <HI>Montgeorges,</HI> who was &s;lain in the late Wars, and who was then a Captain in <HI>Candale,</HI> a &s;tout Soldier, and one who lov'd War a+bove
<PB N="8" REF="8"> all things, to carry a Supply of Officers and Soldiers into <HI>Portugal:</HI> Now <HI>Montgeorges,</HI> being embark'd with his <HI>Company,</HI> and upon his Voy|age into <HI>Portugal,</HI> happen'd to be taken by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which were advertis'd of his <HI>Departure;</HI> upon which there was a nece&s;&s;ity for <HI>France</HI> to take off her Mask; for that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> began already to talk of cutting off <HI>Montgeorges</HI>'s Head.</P>
<P>This apparent <HI>Act</HI> of <HI>Infidelity</HI> vvas attended by &s;everal others, and yet no <HI>Neighbouring Pui&s;&s;ance</HI> in|terpos'd it's <HI>Authority,</HI> to the end the&s;e things might be regulated ac|cording to <HI>Justice:</HI> Not but that there vvas <HI>Warranty</HI> for the <HI>Pyrenaean Peace;</HI> as vvell as there are novv for the Peace of <HI>Nimeghen,</HI> but that
<PB N="9" REF="8"> they are &s;uch, vvho after the <HI>Con|clu&s;ion</HI> of the <HI>Treaty,</HI> never mind aftervvards the <HI>Breaches</HI> vvhich are made of it, &s;o that there is not one at this time takes any care to &s;end a|ny &s;uccour to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> vvho&s;e <HI>Ruine</HI> is attempted by &s;o many in|direct means. On the other &s;ide, the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> vvhether they are be|come in&s;en&s;ible, or vvhich is mo&s;t probable, that they under&s;tand their ovvn <HI>weakne&s;s,</HI> are contended to &s;ee them&s;elves &s;o rudely handl'd vvith|out te&s;tifying the lea&s;t <HI>Re&s;entment,</HI> but only by <HI>Complaints,</HI> altogether misbecoming <HI>Soveraign Princes,</HI> e&s;|pecially if not pro&s;ecuted vvith ef|fectual Deeds; &s;o that others &s;eeing them &s;o patiently &s;vvallovv all <HI>Affronts,</HI> did not think them&s;elves oblig'd to take their <HI>Part.</HI></P>
<PB N="10" REF="9">
<P>Which <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of theirs vvas certainly mo&s;t apparent upon the Occa&s;ion of an <HI>Accident</HI> that hap|ned in <HI>London</HI> betvveen Mon&s;ieur <HI>d'Estrades</HI> and Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Vataville Emba&s;&s;adors</HI> of both <HI>Crowns:</HI> For after the Baron of <HI>Vataville</HI> had got the <HI>Precedence</HI> before Mon&s;ieur <HI>d'E|strades,</HI> upon the Entry of another <HI>Emba&s;&s;ador; Spain</HI> did not only di&s;|claim and di&s;avovv the <HI>Act,</HI> but al|&s;o has for ever &s;tain'd her <HI>Reputati|on,</HI> by an <HI>Ignominious Declaration,</HI> vvhich I dare not repeat, and vvhich I cannot remember with|out blu&s;hing out of my <HI>Re&s;pect</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> to the Nation. However if the thing be call'd to mind, we ought to lay the Fault upon tho&s;e other <HI>Potentates,</HI> that &s;hewed them|&s;elves &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately earne&s;t for the
<PB N="11" REF="9"> Peace, that they never laid to heart the <HI>Affront</HI> which was offer'd to <HI>Spain,</HI> who &s;eeing her &s;elf aban|don'd by all the World, was forc'd to abate of her wonted Haughti|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s the more notable <HI>Head-pieces,</HI> perceiving how proud|ly <HI>France</HI> behav'd her &s;elf upon that occa&s;ion were of opinion, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to with&s;tand Her <HI>Ambition</HI> before the further Encrea&s;e of her Strength and Power: But the Councel of the&s;e prudent <HI>Poli|ticians</HI> was li&s;ten'd to by way of <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> only, and the Seizure of <HI>Blindne&s;s</HI> began to be &s;o general, that they look'd upon tho&s;e who di&s;|cours'd at that rate, as Per&s;ons that rather &s;ought to di&s;turb than pre|&s;erve the Peace &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<PB N="12" REF="10">
<P>Nor did they begin to unhood|wink their Eyes; till <HI>France,</HI> no lon|ger able to continue quiet, re&s;olv'd to carry the War into <HI>Flanders</HI> under <HI>Pretences</HI> altogether as <HI>Chymerical</HI> as tho&s;e at pre&s;ent; But with an <HI>Ad|vocate</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;uch a one as they vvere careful to chu&s;e out of the &s;harpe&s;t witted of the <HI>Chiurme,</HI> un|dertook to beautifie with a &s;pecious varni&s;h, an <HI>Undertaking,</HI> which a <HI>Per&s;on</HI> of <HI>Honesty</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> would have been very much troubl'd to perform; only he who had &s;erv'd his <HI>Apprenti&s;hip</HI> at the <HI>Pettie Bar,</HI> where for <HI>Two Crowns,</HI> they will defend the wickede&s;t <HI>Injustice</HI> in the World, was of Opinion, that be|ing much better <HI>feed</HI> than &s;o, it did not become him to neglect &s;o fare an Opportunity for his <HI>Preferment:</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="10"> So that <HI>Intere&s;t</HI> prevailing above <HI>Truth,</HI> in a &s;hort time there came forth a <HI>Manife&s;to,</HI> wherein they en|deavour'd to maintain, that though the King by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty had renounc'd all manner of <HI>Pretences</HI> which he might hereafter have to the <HI>Low Countries</HI> or <HI>Netherlands,</HI> in right of his Wife, that <HI>Renunciati|on</HI> was invalid, becau&s;e the <HI>Parlia|ment</HI> had never confirm'd the <HI>Ar|ticles.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Manifesto</HI> endeavour'd further to prove, that the <HI>Queen</HI> had a <HI>Right</HI> to &s;everal <HI>Provinces;</HI> and therefore to give the <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> a Ti|tle proper to what they went a|bout to make out, it was Entitul'd <HI>The Rights of the Queen.</HI> For you mu&s;t under&s;tand, that it was the King him&s;elf, who had hindr'd the
<PB N="14" REF="11"> <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty from being Regi|&s;tred in <HI>Parliament,</HI> to the end that for the future it might &s;erve for a <HI>Pretence</HI> again&s;t what had been <HI>&s;ign'd</HI> by Him&s;elf, and the chiefe&s;t <HI>Nobi|lity</HI> of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Which piece of Litigious Craft when it gave occa&s;ion to all the World to reflect upon the <HI>Small Faith</HI> and <HI>Sincerity</HI> of the <HI>French</HI> King, Men vvere &s;urpriz'd with wonder, That &s;o great a Prince, who affe|cted the Title of mo&s;t <HI>Christian King</HI> &s;hould commit &s;uch Violences as would make <HI>Infidels</HI> to blu&s;h; and took plea&s;ure to recount his <HI>Actions,</HI> that by comparing the one with the other, the di&s;advantage might the better appear on the Kings &s;ide. The general que&s;tion was, whether a man were not oblig'd to keep his
<PB N="15" REF="11"> Word which he had &s;o &s;olemnly &s;worn upon the Go&s;pels, confirm'd by &s;o Great and Near an <HI>Alliance,</HI> and where there was nothing omit|ted to render inviolable by all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Acts</HI> that could be performed?

<P>And indeed there needs no grea|ter Skill in <HI>Theology</HI> to under&s;tand, that <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> which is the &s;ame Thing, &s;ufficiently tea|ches us, that we are to keep our Words, not only to a <HI>Father-in-Law,</HI> as this occa&s;ion requir'd, but al&s;o to
<PB N="16" REF="12"> a <HI>Turk.</HI> There is a notable <HI>Exam|ple</HI> of this in the Per&s;on of a <HI>French</HI> Gentleman of the Family of <HI>An|glure,</HI> from whence there are &s;eve|ral who derive their De&s;cent that live in great &s;plendor to this day. The particular Hi&s;tory of this Fa|mily relates, that one of their An|ce&s;tors being taken in Fight by <HI>So|ladin, Sultan</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was &s;et at Li|berty after a long Impri&s;onment, upon condition that he &s;hould re|turn him&s;elf in Per&s;on with the <HI>Ran&s;om</HI> which the <HI>Soladin</HI> had laid upon his Head; the <HI>Gentleman</HI> com|ing home, and having &s;old part of his <HI>E&s;tate</HI> to make good his <HI>Word,</HI> return'd back to <HI>Soladin,</HI> and told him he had brought his <HI>Ran&s;om in Per&s;on</HI> according to his own <HI>Agree|ment</HI> and <HI>Conditions,</HI> and that if he
<PB N="17" REF="12"> pleas'd to name any <HI>Per&s;on</HI> to re|ceive it he vvould pre&s;ently tell it out. <HI>Soladin,</HI> vvho never thought a|ny more of him, but believ'd, that &s;ince he had let him go, he &s;hould never &s;ee him again, vvas &s;o &s;urpriz'd at his <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> that after he had embrac'd and care&s;s'd him vvith all imaginable <HI>Endearment,</HI> he told him, that from thence for|ward he &s;hould have a greater re|&s;pect for the <HI>Christians</HI> than ever he had; and thereupon he did not on|ly <HI>relea&s;e</HI> him of his <HI>Ran&s;om,</HI> but or|dered his <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> to give him <HI>Ten Thou&s;and Franks,</HI> which vvas a great Sum in tho&s;e days. He fur|ther de&s;ir'd his <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> and that alvvays the <HI>Elde&s;t</HI> of his <HI>Family</HI> might be called <HI>Saladin,</HI> to the end that if Po&s;terity &s;hould be curious
<PB N="18" REF="13"> to know why they bore a <HI>Name</HI> &s;o extraordinary among the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> they might be inform'd at the &s;ame time of the Occa&s;ion: Which <HI>Re|que&s;t</HI> of <HI>Soladin</HI> has been ob&s;erv'd e|ver &s;ince; in&s;omuch that the Count <HI>De&s;toges,</HI> the Elde&s;t of the <HI>Family,</HI> is this day nam'd <HI>Soladin.</HI></P>

<P>And indeed at that very time, when the forementioned <HI>Manife&s;to</HI> appear'd, the King took away all their Privileges, bani&s;hed all tho&s;e that were &s;u&s;pected to have any affection for the <HI>publick Interest,</HI> and in a word, contemned it &s;o far that he never went thither, but in his <HI>Ri|ding Boots</HI> and his <HI>Cane</HI> in his Hand.

<PB N="22" REF="15"> <HI>Edict,</HI> which &s;avoured in my opi|nion of much more wrong and In|ju&s;tice: For whereas, when any new Impo&s;ition was thought upon and laid upon the People, or any o|ther Innovation was impo&s;ed upon the Government, the King was wont to go in Per&s;on to &s;ee tho&s;e <HI>Edicts</HI> ratifyed; the <HI>Parliament</HI> is now obliged to make the <HI>Ratificati|on</HI> upon a bare <HI>Letter</HI> under the Privy Signet, many times carryed by a Footman; So that this great <HI>Tribu|nal</HI> formerly erected to be a <HI>Media|tor</HI> between the King and the Peo|ple, and to pre&s;erve the one from the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the other, is now it &s;elf enforced to bow and crouch to the <HI>Kings Will:</HI> For now they dare not make tho&s;e Remon&s;trances, which formerly they did, nor plead

<PB N="24" REF="17"> which they endeavoured to prove, that the Renunciation of all Claims which the King had made by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty was utterly void, becau&s;e it was never verifyed by the <HI>Parliament.</HI> And yet if the <HI>Renun|ciation</HI> had been good, which they did not much matter to di&s;pute, it could not have been long in force, by rea&s;on that the <HI>Dauphin</HI> had not ratifyed the Treaty, who might pretend a greater Intere&s;t as being his <HI>Mothers</HI> Heir. In truth, this <HI>Pam|phlet</HI> was nothing but a Compo&s;ure of Words well put together, con|teining very little or no rea&s;on. For to begin with the fir&s;t, true it is, That the <HI>Parliament</HI> were wont to ratify the mo&s;t remarkable Acts of the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> but that &s;uch a <HI>Ratifi|cation</HI> was ab&s;olutely E&s;&s;ential is
<PB N="25" REF="17"> that which we deny, and which I &s;hall endeavour to prove: For Ex|ample, if the King happens to marry with any <HI>Foreign</HI> Prince&s;s, the <HI>Parliament</HI> has nothing to do with the <HI>Contract:</HI> Nor do we find, that the <HI>Parliament</HI> had any knowledg of that between <HI>H.</HI> 4. and <HI>Marie Medi|ci;</HI> or which is &s;till fre&s;h in <HI>Memory,</HI> of the <HI>Marriage</HI> between the <HI>Dau|phin</HI> and <HI>Madam</HI> the <HI>Dauphine&s;s.</HI> And yet the <HI>Affairs</HI> tran&s;acted were as important, as perhaps the Kings <HI>Renunciation</HI> made by the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty: But &s;ome perhaps will ob|ject, That the Ca&s;e is far different; For in a <HI>Treaty</HI> of Peace is &s;tated and handled the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Peoples Peace; whereas in a Trea|ty of <HI>Marriage</HI> there is nothing tran&s;acted, but the Concern of two
<PB N="26" REF="18"> <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI> I confe&s;s the rea&s;on &s;eems plau&s;ible but ea&s;ie to refute: For if it be in re&s;pect of the Peoples In|tere&s;t that a Treaty of Peace ought to be ratifyed by the <HI>Parliament,</HI> why are not the <HI>Treaties</HI> of <HI>War</HI> ratifyed in the &s;ame manner? They will have a Treaty which exterminates War, and re&s;tores Peace to a King|dom, in&s;tead of Trouble and Con|fu&s;ion that Reigned there before, to be &s;ubject to a <HI>Parliamentary</HI> Ratifi|cation; but they will not have a Treaty of <HI>War,</HI> that bani&s;hes Peace, and brings in Di&s;order and Confu|&s;ion to be ratifyed by <HI>Parliament,</HI> which neverthele&s;s was in&s;tituted to no other end than the Pre&s;ervation of the People. Let us rather &s;ay, that the Cu&s;tom of verifying <HI>Trea|ties</HI> of Peace in this manner was not
<PB N="27" REF="18"> introduced, till after it was ordain|ed, that all the Royal Benevolences &s;hould be ratifyed in <HI>Parliament,</HI> and that &s;uch as were not &s;o verifyed, &s;hould be of no value, which was done to prevent Princes who are generally prone to profu&s;e Libera|lity, from giving away all their Pa|trimony, and being afterwards ob|lig'd, for want of Money to vex the People. Let us grant then &s;ay I, that the Parliament, &s;etting that by &s;ome Treaties of Peace, con&s;i|derable Alienations were made from the Crown, chiefly under <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> to free him&s;elf out of the hands of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and af|terwards under <HI>Francis</HI> the <HI>First,</HI> to deliver him&s;elf out of the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> had Authority given them to verify Treaties of Peace,
<PB N="28" REF="19"> to prevent the Di&s;tipation of the Crown Revenues. But their Au|thority is yet greater, when it &s;hall be a Law received in <HI>France,</HI> that the Parliament may vacate Treaties which are not verifyed, that is to &s;ay, if the Treaties were not made in due Form, or were found preju|dicial to the People.</P>
<P>But it cannot be &s;aid, that <HI>France</HI> receiv'd any prejudice by the <HI>Pyre|naean</HI> Treaty, or that the Treaty was not concluded with all the u|&s;ual Formalities. In re&s;pect of <HI>For|malities</HI> there were &s;o many ob&s;erv'd as took up much more time than was nece&s;&s;ary for the Repo&s;e of the People, who after &s;o tedious a War, thir&s;ted after nothing &s;o much as Peace; nor was it enough that <HI>De Lionne</HI> and <HI>Pimentell</HI> &s;et their
<PB N="29" REF="19"> hands to the Treaty, but to render it more &s;olemn; Cardinal <HI>Mazarine</HI> and <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> the Principal Mini&s;ters of both Crowns, were oblig'd to &s;ign it al&s;o, &s;o that we may &s;ay that it was the mo&s;t <HI>Authentick Treaty</HI> that had been con|cluded in a long time before. Be|&s;ides, they had ob&s;erv'd all the Cir|cum&s;tances imaginable, in&s;omuch that the place appointed for the Conferences, was neither in <HI>France</HI> nor in <HI>Spain,</HI> which neverthele&s;s is very remarkable: For that then they were willing, that <HI>Spain</HI> &s;hould go cheek by jowle with <HI>France;</HI> yet afterwards they would not allow that the <HI>Treaty</HI> had been ratify'd: But that which &s;eemed to put the Treaty not only out of the King's but out of the reach of all <HI>France</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="20"> to do it Injury was that the chiefe&s;t of the <HI>Clergy</HI> and <HI>Nobility</HI> had &s;ign'd the <HI>Contract</HI> of <HI>Marriage</HI> between the King and the <HI>Infanta,</HI> wherein the afore&s;aid <HI>Renunciation</HI> was con|tain'd.

<P>Now that this <HI>Treaty</HI> brought no prejudice to <HI>France</HI> is as ea&s;ie to prove: For though <HI>France</HI> at that time had a great advantage over <HI>Spain,</HI> we mu&s;t con&s;ider neverthe|le&s;s, that this advantage might one day turn again&s;t it &s;elf, as being ob|lig'd to &s;hare it's <HI>Conque&s;ts</HI> with <HI>Eng|land,</HI>

<P>But let us conclude a di&s;cour&s;e which 'tis to be feared will do but
<PB N="144" REF="77"> little good, in regard that all the World is of that di&s;po&s;ition; as not to love to be too nakedly told the Truth. So that as much as <HI>France</HI> may be offended with me for di&s;co|vering her Maxims and Policies, as much will others bear me ill will for reprehending their Weakne&s;s and Blindne&s;s. Yet I cannot for|bear from &s;aying this, with the ha|zard of what ever they may think, that they make them&s;elves Accom|plices in all the <HI>Enterprizes</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> if they do not put an end to tho&s;e differences that have &s;o long kept them in Di&s;-union. For what can we &s;ay more? For one &s;trives to invade <HI>Lubec,</HI> another <HI>Pomeraenia,</HI> others make head again&s;t them, while on the other &s;ide a Potent E|nemy minds nothing more then to bring them altogether under his
<PB N="145" REF="77"> &s;ubjection. They will not permit one Neighbour to grow more pow|erful then another, but the never con&s;ider that there is an Enemy approaching, who not contented to have encrea&s;ed his Dominions by large Conque&s;ts, will never be &s;atisfied with being no more then their Neighbour, agreeable to what is &s;aid by the <HI>Author</HI> of a <HI>late Pa&s;quil</HI> upon the pre&s;ent condition of <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> For when he &s;peaks of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> he brings them in &s;aying, That they will not have the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> Reign over them; to which an&s;wer is made, That they <HI>Act</HI> like <HI>Fools</HI> and <HI>Blindmen;</HI> they are afraid le&s;t the <HI>Dog</HI> &s;hould bite 'em, but ne'r mind the <HI>Wolf</HI> who is ready to devour 'em.

<PB N="146" REF="78"> would fain joyn <HI>Hamborough</HI> and <HI>Su|beck</HI> to the <HI>Crown;</HI> but they do not &s;ee that <HI>France</HI> will not only joyn to her <HI>Crown,</HI> not only both tho&s;e Ci|ties, but their own <HI>Territories</HI> them|&s;elves, if they do not <HI>Unite</HI> to hin|der Her.

<P>Every own knows his Birth, and it would be &s;uperfluous to &s;peak of it here, were it not to tell ye, that his Father being a <HI>French Man,</HI> and his Mother a <HI>French Woman,</HI> 'tis no wonder he retains the nature of a <HI>French Man</HI> him&s;elf. Neverthele&s;s there is this to be &s;aid again&s;t him,
<PB N="149" REF="79"> that after he had been born in <HI>Swe|den,</HI> and rai&s;ed from nothing by the favour of the King, all other <HI>Ob|ligations</HI> ought to have given place; for that, what was a Vertue in his Father was a Crime in Him. Now who could ever dream without having an enmity to his per&s;on, that while <HI>France</HI> treats the King his Ma&s;ter after &s;o gentile a man|ner, that he &s;hould con&s;pire the &s;lavery of <HI>Germany?</HI> and yet was it not he that made &s;o many Jour|neys to <HI>Stra&s;burgh,</HI> where he had more advantage to treat then o|thers, by rea&s;on of his familiarity with the Language, and for that he was lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected?

<P>The way then to prevent &s;o ma|ny Abu&s;es, is to imitate the Exam|ple of <HI>France</HI> at this day; for &s;he does not only confi&s;cate the Goods of &s;uch as betake them&s;elves to the Service of other Princes, but &s;he always prohibits them under &s;trict Penalties and corporal puni&s;hment, to go abroad.

<P>Let us then conclude, that &s;o long as there is no order taken to

<P>There might be &s;omething al&s;o &s;aid touching the Remedy to be ap|plied for prevention of the&s;e Mi&s;|chiefs, with which we find our &s;elves at this day overwhelm'd. But in regard I can &s;ay no more then what other People have &s;aid before me, I had rather be &s;ilent, then to make too many repetitions in vain, and for the mo&s;t part ra|ther Speculative then Real. For when I con&s;ider what I have read in &s;o many Authors, and heard in &s;o many places, that it behoves all the Prote&s;tants to unite together, &s;ince the Catholicks are &s;o negli|gent, to oppo&s;e them&s;elves again&s;t the common Ruin, may not I con|clude,
<PB N="155" REF="82"> that it is much more ea&s;ie to di&s;cour&s;e in this manner, then probable to &s;ee the Effect of &s;uch advice.

<PB N="156" REF="83">
<P>The Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> which is maliciou&s;ly incen&s;ed to our De&s;tru|ction, does not perceive the heavy Hand of God upon her for &s;o many Crimes, for which &s;he is accomp|table to his Ju&s;tice in re&s;pect of us, provoking &s;till the &s;ame Ju&s;tice by new tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, in contempt of Heavenly Mercy. Nor does &s;he perceive that the Authors of all the&s;e violent Councels, I mean the Ju&s;uits do not advice the&s;e things but for their own Intere&s;t.

Neverthe|le&s;s let no man believe that what I have &s;aid proceeds from any natu|ral Aver&s;ion to them, &s;o natural to tho&s;e of my Religion. I prote&s;t before God, that I bear malice to

<P>It is now a year, that the Sieur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> travels up and down &s;everal parts of your Maje&s;ties Dominions, on the <HI>Borders</HI> of <HI>Hungary.</HI> He always pretends his Ma&s;ters, as if we could &s;ee that <HI>Dantzick</HI> or <HI>Rogiomont,</HI> which are the Places the <HI>French</HI> come through, were not nearer and more proper to receive what Orders the <HI>French</HI> King would &s;end, but he &s;tays there to ob&s;erve the nearer, the Af|fairs of <HI>Hungary:</HI> It may be al&s;o, to be in a better condition to give Count <HI>Tekeley Joy,</HI> and to get the reputation with him, of the progre&s;s the <HI>Turks</HI> by his means, might make in that Country</P>
<P>I de&s;ire your Maje&s;ty, That after you have &s;een the <HI>Memorial,</HI> I pre|&s;ent; and after you are convinced of all the Arts the <HI>French</HI> have u&s;ed in

<P>You may do &s;o much the more ju&s;tly, great King, becau&s;e the Ro|man Catholick Church, your Mo|ther, e&s;teems them as Excommuni|cated Per&s;ons, who &s;ide with Infi|dels, whether it be carrying them Arms, or treating with them.</P>
<P>The Seiur <HI>Du Vernay</HI> has drawn this upon his own head, and if he is puni&s;hed according to his de&s;erts the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King will bani&s;h him his Kingdom, for exeeding his <HI>Orders,</HI> &amp; engaging his Ma&s;ter's Ho|nor and Reputation. In fine, he has
