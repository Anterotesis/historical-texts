<P>FROM <HI>London,</HI> the Epitome of <HI>Eng|land</HI>

thro' <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> a County famous
for its goodly Edifices, as well
wi&s;ely Compacted together upon
the Banks of <HI>Thames;</HI> as likewi&s;e for divers
&s;tately Palaces di&s;per&s;ed in &s;everal Parts there|of.
The fir&s;t Town of Note we came to was
<HI>Colebrook,</HI> which takes its Name from the Ri|ver
<HI>Cole;</HI> a Town of great Antiquity, and of
a con&s;iderable length, and well &s;tored with
Inns: We &s;tayed here a &s;mall time, and &s;o &s;et

<HI>MAIDENHEAD</HI> is Eight Miles di&s;tance
from <HI>Colebrook,</HI> and &s;o we came into the Con|fines
of <HI>Bark&s;hire.</HI> It is a County of near e|qual
Length and Breadth; it was thus De|nominated
from the Super&s;titious Ado|ration
that was given to the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Maid,
being one of the Eleven Thou&s;and, which
by the Conduct of St. <HI>Ur&s;la,</HI> returning home

<HI>Germany</HI> by the Tyrant <HI>Attila,</HI> that mo&s;t cruel

credibly informed, That <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> making
an Inrode into this County did pa&s;s over the
River not far from this Place, and by the
voluntary Submi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e People here,

the Crown to the Church of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI>
but <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> taking a very great
Affection to it by rea&s;on of its plea&s;ant Situ|ation,
made an Exchange with the Abbot
of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> for &s;ome other Lands in the
room of this, and &s;o it returned to the
Crown again. The Palace in which the
King re&s;ides when he comes down hither,
is inferior to none for Sight and Plea&s;ure
throughout all His Maje&s;ty's Dominions. In
<PB N="3" REF="9">
the front of it lies a plea&s;ant Valley, chec|quered
with the various colors of Green and
Red Verdant Meadows, and fertile Tillage,
melodious Woods, and the murmuring of
the Noble River <HI>Thames.</HI> Behind it is a
plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect of a delightful Forre&s;t, de|&s;igned
on purpo&s;e by Nature for Sport and
Recreation, whil&s;t &s;he &s;o liberally &s;tocks it
with numerous Herds of Deer, lurking a|mong&s;t
the &s;hady. Thickets; and our Kings

the City of <HI>London,</HI> it being &s;o fine a Place of
plea&s;ure and delight. K. <HI>Edward</HI> the Third
being born at this Town, did much aug|ment
and &s;trengthen the Ca&s;tle there upon
the Hill, which <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t had before
erected, fortifying the &s;ame with &s;trong
Walls and Trenches, which are now to be

<P><HI>READING</HI> in this County is a Town of
very good Note, and not inferior to any in
all that County. It is &s;ituated, as it were,
on the &s;ide of a little Hill, with a &s;mall a&s;cent
towards the Market-place. It is very well
watered by a good River which runs along
the one &s;ide of it, and hath the Noble River
of <HI>Thames,</HI> which comes within a little di|&s;tance,
on the other &s;ide. It hath a Mayor
for its chief Magi&s;trate, and it is famous
for a very great Market once a Week for all
Sorts of Grain. We &s;tayed here but one
Night, having a de&s;ign to take a farther view
of this County by <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and &s;o to</P>
<P><HI>ABBINGTON,</HI> This is a fair Town in
this County; the River <HI>I&s;is</HI> after it hath win|ded
it &s;elf a long way about in a crooked
Channel, makes its approach to this Town.
It is a large and populous Place, and re|ceives
its Denomination from a famous Ab|by
which was here erected, although this
Mona&s;tery did, for &s;ome Years, flouri&s;h ex|ceedingly,
yet it was afterwards Subverted
by the fury of the <HI>Danes;</HI> but through the
<PB N="5" REF="10">
Bounties and Munificence of King <HI>Edgar&punc;</HI>
was re&s;tored again to its Primitive Splendor
and Greatne&s;s, and by the Indu&s;try and Care
of the <HI>Norman</HI> Abbots, it grew to that pitch
of Grandeur, and &s;o exceeding Rich and
Wealthy, that it began to have an E&s;teem
of it &s;elf beyond all Compari&s;on, and indeed
the Ruins too be-&s;peak it to have been a ve|ry
glorious Structure: As for the Town,
though it had its chief Dependance from
this Abby, yet from the Year 1430, that one
<HI>John,</HI> Surnamed St. <HI>Helena,</HI> built a &s;trong
Bridge of Stone over its River, and &s;o made
a Through-fair and High Road through the
Town, it began to be populous, and much
frequented, and ever &s;ince hath been mo&s;t
de&s;ervedly reputed the eminent, principle
Town in this County. The Inhabitants are
great Maul&s;ters, and Barly is the great Com|modity
of the Market. The Magi&s;trates, by
their Vigilancy and Care, do keep up this
Corporation in great Honour and Reque&s;t,
and the Mayor and Aldermen are very Cir|cum&s;pect
in the di&s;charge of their Offices;
and for the more great and weighty Matters
which are above their Sphere, the Judges,
when they come their Circuit, and keep
the A&s;&s;izes here for the County, do ea&s;e
them of that trouble, by giving a final De|termination
of all.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="11">
<HI>FARRINGDON</HI> was the next Town of
Note we went to in this County, which
though it be &s;ituated upon a &s;tony Soil, yet
'tis now as famous for its great Market, as
it was once Renowned for its Impregnable
Fortre&s;s, which <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> built
here again&s;t King <HI>Stephen,</HI> which the King
though with the lo&s;s of a great number of
Soldiers, at la&s;t by his continual A&s;&s;aults and
Batteries took and utterly demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But one thing is to be ob&s;erved in this
County; That it is very plea&s;ant and fertile,
watered with the River <HI>I&s;is,</HI> adorned with
woody Hills and thick Groves, and in its
Ea&s;tern parts thereof with fertile Valleys,
and in the We&s;tern part, being called <HI>The
Vale of White Hor&s;e,</HI> is extreamly delightful,
and Nature compen&s;ates the Barrenne&s;s of
the Soil in one place, by her manifold
Gifts &s;he be&s;tows upon it in another.</P>
<P><HI>NEWBURY</HI> was the next place we went to.
'Tis a Town of very good Note, and of a
con&s;iderable largene&s;s, governed by a Mayor
and Aldermen, and hath a very commodious
Market-hou&s;e, which is not much inferior
to any in the County. The Town is &s;itua|ted
in a plea&s;ant Valley, and watered by a
very good River, called <HI>Newbury River,</HI> which
runs through one part of the Town near the
Market-hou&s;e; and in the other part of it is a
<PB N="7" REF="11">
very find Rivelet, which runs from one end of
the Town to the other, and is mighty ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for all the Inhabitants. We made no
long &s;tay here, but went to <HI>Marlborough</HI> in
<HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> of which hereafter.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Wilt&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MARLBOROUGH</HI> is a Town of an
indifferent largene&s;s, and is Ruled by a Ma|yor
and Aldermen. The Buildings of this
Town, and the Market-place, are not much
inferior to any Town in <HI>England;</HI> but that
which is mo&s;t remarkable, and to be admi|red
at is, a Mount belonging to the Duke
of <HI>Summer&s;et,</HI> the like is not in <HI>England.</HI> The
Mount it &s;elf is made round, with a Quick|&s;et
Hedge which is all entire, and goes &s;eve|ral
times round about, the Mount ri&s;ing with
a very &s;mall A&s;cent till it comes up to the
top; within this Hedge is a very plain Path,
or Walk, and the ground &s;eems to be &s;o
even, that you cannot well perceive the ri&s;e
of it till you are at the top, which is of a
very great height, and of a large circumfe|rence,
but yet as you go down you may ea|&s;ily
perceive the ground fall much. The
Gardner there told us, That it is a Mile from
the bottom up to the top, and go the Path-way
which leads up to it. On the top of the
Mount, is a very fine level piece of Ground,
planted with &s;everal &s;orts of Fruit-Trees;
<PB N="8" REF="12">
there &s;tands likewi&s;e on the top, a very large
leaden Ce&s;tern, of about 12 foot &s;quare, and
4 foot deep, and is repleni&s;hed with Water
by a leaden Pipe, which comes from a Spring
along the Path that leads up to the top. On
the one &s;ide of this Mount is a very commo|dious
Wilderne&s;s, and on the other a fine
Garden; in a word, this Mount is the mo&s;t
to be admired, and mu&s;t have the Re&s;pect
of all Travellers, to be the greate&s;t piece of
Artificial Workman&s;hip in our own Nati|on.
We &s;tayed here but one Night, and
went to take a farther View of this County,
in which there are many things very ob&s;erv|able.
About two Miles out of this Town is
a great Down, called <HI>Marlborough Downs,</HI>
where there is an exceeding Curio&s;ity of
Nature's workman&s;hip, it is a huge number
of Ma&s;&s;y Stones, they are called by the Name
of <HI>The Grey Wethers,</HI> and &s;hew to your &s;ight,
at a di&s;tance, like a great number of Sheep,
and &s;ome of them higher; but for the great
number of them, and containing &s;uch a va&s;t
di&s;tance of Land, to be all in one and the
like po&s;ture. It is a large Plain, or Valley,
between two Hills where they &s;tand, and is
in breadth almo&s;t a Mile, and about &s;ix Miles
in length, as we were informed, undoubted|ly
it hath as much need to be mentioned, as
any thing in the Kingdom. Having made
&s;ome Ob&s;ervations here, we went to take
<PB N="9" REF="12">
&s;ome account of <HI>Stonehenge</HI> in this County,
of which I &s;hall give you a &s;hort Relation.</P>
<P><HI>STONEHENGE.</HI> This place contains
in it, within the circumference of three Hun|dred
foot, a rude and indige&s;ted Ma&s;s of va&s;t
large Stones, rough, and of a grey colour,
25 Foot in length, 10 in breadth, and 8 in
thickne&s;s; they look as if they were hewen
&s;quare, and are joined two and two toge|ther,
and every couple hath a third Stone
lying a-cro&s;s, which is fa&s;tened by Tennants
that enter into Morte&s;&s;es, not clo&s;ed with a|ny
Morter. It appears as if they had been &s;et
in three Ranks going round, as Circles, one
within another, whereof the uttermo&s;t and
large&s;t is in compa&s;s about 300 Foot, but the
other Ranks are decayed, and &s;ome of them
being faln down to the ground, 'tis very dif|ficult
to reckon how many there are; like|wi&s;e
it &s;eems very &s;trange, how &s;uch im|men&s;e
Bulks &s;hould happen here, where there
is no Stones of any &s;mall demen&s;ion within
the Neighbourhood: Whereupon &s;ome are
of an Opinion, That they are not purely na|tural,
or had their growth in this place.
'Tis now generally credited and believed,
that they were a Monument &s;et up by <HI>Au|relius
Ambro&s;e,</HI> in Remembrance of the <HI>Brit|tains</HI>
that were Slain and Buried there, in the
Reign of <HI>Vortiger,</HI> at a Banquet and Com|munication
of <HI>Hengi&s;t,</HI> which the <HI>Saxons</HI> and
<PB N="10" REF="13">
<HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Chronicles te&s;tifie, <HI>That whereas the</HI>
Saxons <HI>about the Year of our Lord</HI> 450. <HI>had &s;lain
Four hundred and eighty of the</HI> Britti&s;h <HI>Nobili|ty
by Treachery, under a Colour of a Parley and
Treaty; this</HI> Aurelius Ambro&s;e <HI>being then King
of the</HI> Brittains, <HI>de&s;irous to continue their Memo|ry,
as well as the Infamy of his ba&s;e and treache|rous
Enemies, cau&s;ed the&s;e Stones to be &s;et up in
the very place of their Death and Burial, the
which Stones had been fir&s;t brought out of</HI> Africk
<HI>into</HI> Ireland, <HI>and there placed on Mount</HI> Killare,
<HI>and from thence, by the Art and Magick of</HI> Mer|lina,
<HI>a renowned Magician in that Age, were at
length conveyed to this place upon this very Occa|&s;ion.</HI>
Others think, that the <HI>Brittains</HI> did E|rect
this, as a Monument for <HI>Ambro&s;ius</HI> him|&s;elf,
to perpetuate his glorious Name to Po|&s;terity,
who died afterwards upon this place
by the Sword, in the An&s;wer of their Quar|rel,
and Vindication of their Liberties; how|ever
certain it is, that there are thereabouts
certain little Hills, or Banks, under which
there are &s;ometimes found Bones of tall, gi|gantick
Men, and pieces of Armour; and
not far from hence, remains &s;till &s;ome of the
Ruins of an old kind of Fortre&s;s, which the
<HI>Romans,</HI> as it is probable, did rai&s;e for them|&s;elves,
during their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e our
Territories, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>From hence we went to <HI>Wilton-Hou&s;e,</HI> be|longing
to the Earl of <HI>Pembrook.</HI> It is &s;itua|ted
<PB N="11" REF="13">
in a plea&s;ant Valley, and hath the Town
of <HI>Wilton</HI> on the one &s;ide of it, and a &s;pacious
Park on the other &s;ide, with delightful Gar|dens
and Meadows on the other &s;ides, and
a fine River running through the Gardens.
In this Hou&s;e are excellent Rooms, and great
variety of Pictures, and in the Gardens are
undoubtedly the mo&s;t curious Water-works
that are in all <HI>England.</HI> We did not tar|ry
long here, but went away to <HI>Salisbury,</HI>
of which I &s;hall inform you as briefly as I
can.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Wilton-Hou&s;e</HI> we rode to <HI>Salisbury,</HI>
and in our way beheld the place where for|merly
old <HI>Wilton,</HI> the Metropolis of this
County, &s;tood, called <HI>Willey.</HI> 'Tis &s;ituated,
&s;aith <HI>Cambden,</HI> where the two Rivers <HI>Willey|brook</HI>
and <HI>Alderbourne</HI> meet; and here it was
that <HI>Egbert,</HI> King of the <HI>We&s;t Saxons,</HI> in the
Year of our Lord 821, fought the &s;econd
Battle again&s;t the <HI>Mercians,</HI> &s;o bloody on both
&s;ides, that the River <HI>Avon</HI> was all over dyed red
with the Blood of the &s;lain; and in the Year
871, <HI>Alfred</HI> having maintained a long Fight
again&s;t the <HI>Danes,</HI> and upon the fir&s;t On&s;et
had &s;ucce&s;s, but was at la&s;t quite routed, his
Forces defeated, and him&s;elf forced to flee
away to pre&s;erve his life. In the <HI>Saxons</HI> reign
it flouri&s;hed mightily, and <HI>Edgar</HI> built there
a Nunnery, and made his Daughter <HI>Editha</HI>
Lady Governe&s;s thereof; afterwards being
<PB N="12" REF="14">
long expo&s;ed to the fury of the <HI>Danes,</HI> who
were its Mortal Enemies, and de&s;erted the
Bi&s;hops of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> who were at fir&s;t its Sup|porters,
it went to decay, and almo&s;t return|ed
again on a &s;udden into its fir&s;t Principle
of Nothing; and &s;o old <HI>Salisbury</HI> then, and
&s;ince new <HI>Salisbury</HI> which hath &s;prang from
that, have quite extingui&s;hed its Primitive
Lu&s;tre and Glory. Old <HI>Salisbury</HI> was &s;ituated
upon a Hill, expo&s;ed much to Winds and
Storms, very dry, barren and uncomfortable&punc;
by rea&s;on of the great Defect of Water
throughout the whole City; it was well for|tified,
as appears by &s;ome ancient pieces o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">
Walls which are there &s;till to be &s;een. The
<HI>Saxons,</HI> in the Year 553, fir&s;t Sacked it, and
took it, and in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Se|cond,
<HI>O&s;mund,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sherbourne,</HI> Tran&s;la|ted
the See hither, and built a Cathedral
Church, though the <HI>Danes</HI> not long after, ha|ving
took and burnt the City, that likewi&s;e
underwent the &s;ame fatal Calamity, and was
levelled with the ground, till both of them
were rai&s;ed again in <HI>William the Conqueror</HI>'s
time; for after that he had made his Pro|gre&s;s
throughout all his Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI>
he at la&s;t Summoned all the Three Orders of
the Nation to come hither, and here to take
their Oaths of Allegiance to him: But after|wards
in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the Fir&s;t, the
Citizens being oppre&s;&s;ed by the In&s;olence of
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the Soldiers, which then kept Garri&s;on, and
was in great want for Water, re&s;olved to free
them&s;elves from the&s;e Burdens, by Tran&s;|planting
them&s;elves into another Soil, which
they unanimou&s;ly agreed upon, and &s;eated
them&s;elves about a Mile from this place in a
more plea&s;ant Valley, where the flowry
Meads, and Chry&s;tial-&s;tream'd Rivers, gave
them a more hearty Welcome, and far bet|ter
Entertainment than before they were ac|quainted
withal. After a new Colony was
Tran&s;planted hither, <HI>Richard Pore,</HI> fir&s;t Bi&s;hop
of <HI>Chiche&s;ter,</HI> then of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> afterwards of
<HI>Durham,</HI> did likewi&s;e Tran&s;plant the Cathe|dral
from the barren, dry place in which it
was erected near to the old Ca&s;tle of the
Earls of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and built it in a more
plentiful Soil; this mo&s;t pious Prelate, for he
did not only Tran&s;plant it, but (by the Ad|vice
and Contrivance of the mo&s;t excellent
and ingenious Artificers, not only Natives,
but Foreigners, whom he drew hither by his
large Rewards) he rai&s;ed it to that Splender
and Magnificence, that now it matches with the
&s;talie&s;t of Structures, for the rare Workman&s;hip
thereof throughout the Nation. The Steeple
is built in the form of a Pyramid very high,
and as the Pole Star directs the Pilot at Sea,
&s;o doth this Spire direct the wandring Tra|veller
over the Plain, di&s;covering its lofty
head at the di&s;tance of 20 Miles, as we were
<PB N="14" REF="15">
credibly inform'd; but the admirablene&s;s of
the Structure con&s;i&s;ts in this, That it hath as
many Pillars as there are Hours in the Year,
and the&s;e not clo&s;e but you may &s;ee the En|tertices
betwixt them, and &s;hake tho&s;e that
are of the le&s;&s;er &s;ize, and there is as many
Windows as there are Days in the Year, and
the&s;e very artificially Adorned, and curiou&s;ly
Painted to admiration; and there is likewi&s;e
as many Doors as there is Weeks in the Year,
and as many Chappels as Months. Thus did
this great Prelate, which by augmenting it,
augment his own Fame, and even Cannoniz
him&s;elf: And as the Church was then re-e|dified,
&s;o was the City much enlarged too
by the Citizens, and for the more &s;weetne&s;s,
as well as cleanline&s;s of their Habitations,
they made &s;everal Channels and Rivolets in
the mid&s;t of their Streets very commodious
and beneficial to them. Thus, by degrees,
Old <HI>Salisbury</HI> is vani&s;hed away, and very lit|tle
to be &s;een in it, but the Ruins and old
Walls of the Earl's Ca&s;tle, and one &s;mall
Dwelling-hou&s;e, and New <HI>Salisbury</HI> is be|come
glorious and aimable, re&s;orted to, and
frequented and admired by Per&s;ons of all
Qualities and Degrees; for its Hou&s;es are
&s;tately, its Churches magnificent, its Streets
clean, its Rivers plea&s;ant and well &s;tored with
Fi&s;h, its Gardens delightful and very fragrant,
and nothing wanting in it to plea&s;e either
<PB N="15" REF="15">
the Eye or the Pallate; it is governed by a
Mayor and Aldermen. Thus have I given
you a brief Account of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> I could have
wrote much more, for there are many other
things very ob&s;ervable in this County, e&s;pe|cially
for Travellers to take notice of, which
is too tedious here to relate.</P>

<HEAD>Summer&s;et&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t Place of Note we came to in this
County was <HI>Wells,</HI> the chief City of the
Shire, and receives its Denomination from the
variety of fre&s;h and whol&s;ome Springs which
bubble up about it in great abundance. The
Hou&s;es therein are well contrived, and built of
Stone, the Government &s;afe and regular, but
the chief Ornament hereof is the Cathedral,
built by King <HI>Ina</HI> in honour to St. <HI>Andrew;</HI>
the Church hath been enriched with large
Revenues by religious Benefactors; it was
made a Bi&s;hop's See in the Reign of King <HI>Ed|ward</HI>
the Second, and <HI>Eadulphus</HI> was Con&s;ti|tuted
the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop here in the Reign of
<HI>William Rufus,</HI> and in the Year 1092, <HI>John,</HI> a
<HI>Turon</HI> born, being elected Bi&s;hop, united that
of <HI>Bath</HI> with this; and hence it comes to
pa&s;s, that he that is Bi&s;hop of this See, is cal|led
Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath</HI> and <HI>Wells.</HI> This Church
underwent the &s;ame Calamities that other re|ligious
Places did in this Kingdom, and took
<PB N="16" REF="16">
away the Revenues annexed to it; 'tis a
magnificent Structure, and the Quire of it
yeilds to none for &s;tateline&s;s; if we con&s;ider
the artificial Bo&s;&s;es very delicately gilded
which adorn it above, or the curious Co|lumns
which uphold it below, or the Bi&s;hop's
Seat of Marble, &s;et out with mo&s;t glorious
Embelli&s;hments, &s;upported with rich Pillars,
and with its towring Piramids, being the
Head and Ornament in a more e&s;pecial man|ner
of the Quire, as he is of the Church; to
this I may add the variety of carved Images,
which almo&s;t environ the Church on the
out &s;ide, containing the Hi&s;tory of the Old
Te&s;tament, and the curious Architecture of
the Chapter-hou&s;e, &s;upported only by one
large Column which &s;tands in the middle of
it. Near unto the Church is the Bi&s;hop's Pa|lace
of great Grandeur, which becomes a
Reverend Father of the Church to be &s;eated ed
in. But the remarkable&s;t, and which can|not
but have the re&s;pect of all Travellers to
be the mo&s;t admirable piece of Nature's
Workman&s;hip in our Kingdom, is a Place
called <HI>Ochy-hole,</HI> two Miles from this City:
'Tis a Cave under a very high Rock, &s;itua|ted
among&s;t the <HI>Mendippe-hills,</HI> of which I
&s;hall endeavour to give a De&s;cription as
briefly as I can.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
<HI>OCHY-HOLE.</HI> After that we had, with
&s;ome difficulty, climbed up to the top of a
Rock, we went along the Brow of a Hill till
we came to the Mouth of the Cave, where
opening a Door that gave entrance, and ligh|ting
24 Candles of 6 in the Pound, which we
provided for that purpo&s;e, we ventured in;
being got within it, we found the Cave very
hollow, and &s;o dark, that the Candles there
&s;carce burning &s;o bright, though there were
24, as two doth ordinary in the Night in
one of our large&s;t Rooms; we thought cer|tainly
we had been come into the Confines
of the Infernal Regions, or &s;ome &s;uch di&s;|mal
Place, and began to be affraid to vi&s;it it,
<HI>viz. That although we entered in frolick&s;ome
and merry, yet we might return out of it Sad
and Pen&s;ive, and never more be &s;een to Laugh
whil&s;t we lived in the World;</HI> &s;uch dreadful
Apprehen&s;ions &s;eized upon &s;ome of us; and
indeed we had cau&s;e to fear &s;ome &s;uch O|perations
might have proceeded from this,
as well as the other, &s;ince both were e|qually
uncomfortable, by rea&s;on of our de|privation
from the lea&s;t glimmerings of light,
and con&s;equently had the &s;ame Circum&s;tan|ces
to beget both Horror and Amazement:
however we plucked up our Spirits, and crept
in one after another as fa&s;t as we could conve|niently:
The Cave as we went a long was
parted into &s;everal kinds of Rooms, the

Names whereof our Guides informed us:
The fir&s;t was the Kitchin, and at the Door
&s;ticks out a large Ma&s;s of the Rock, which,
they tell us, was the Porter's head, formerly
the Keeper of this Cave; it bears the re&s;em|blance
of a Head, and by that lies a Stone
which they call <HI>The Tomb&s;tone,</HI> under which,
the Report is, That his Body lies Enter|red,
and his Dogherd by him in the &s;ame
&s;ub&s;tance; yet their Transformations are not
&s;o &s;trange and wonderful, being &s;omething
too fabulous to be given Credit to, as the va|riety
which the Rock affords into which they
are incorporated, part of it gli&s;tering like
Silver, and part like Diamonds, and both ap|pear
very plea&s;ant to the Eye: A little fur|ther
on the right hand is another piece of the
Rock that bears the re&s;emblance of a Bell, and
on the left hand a Ve&s;&s;el, which they term
a But, in which the Beer of an old Sorcere&s;s,
(Cou&s;in to the famous <HI>Circe,</HI> Lady Governe&s;s
of this di&s;mal Cave,) u&s;ed to be work'd in;
'tis a hollow Ce&s;tern of a con&s;iderable depth
always filled with Water, and now and then
flowing over, to which the drops of Water
which continually trickle down from the
top of the Rock add every moment fre&s;h
&s;upplies; hard by this &s;tands another Ve&s;&s;el
of hers, in which, they &s;ay, &s;he made her
Mault, they call it the <HI>Ea&s;t Hurdle,</HI> 'tis like|wi&s;e
hollow, and of a pretty depth. Now
<PB N="19" REF="18">
appears unto your view the old Witch her
&s;elf, heating of her Furnace which &s;eems
black and &s;ooty; it &s;eems to be Alabla&s;ter,
by rea&s;on of its whitene&s;s, though 'tis mo&s;t
probable to be the product of Nature, and
not of Art, becau&s;e the place is very unfit
and very un&s;uitable for any Arti&s;t to exer|ci&s;e
his Skill in, it being very oft &s;o low,
that it is impo&s;&s;ible here and there for any
one to &s;tand upright in it; and therefore it
was that we were forced frequently to &s;toop,
and buckle almo&s;t double for fear of hiting
our Heads again&s;t the Rock, until we came
to &s;ome Steps which we were to de&s;cend,
and the Defect thereto was very tedious and
affrightful, for on the right hand the Rock
hung down over us extream low and &s;loping,
and on the left hand a great Rivolet which
runs along through the Cave, being pretty
deep, and making a loud noi&s;e in its gliding,
yet at length we came &s;weating into ano|ther
Room which is called <HI>The Hall,</HI> and
here, at fir&s;t &s;ight, we were entertained with
as great a Rarity as <HI>Nature</HI> hath in all her
Store-hou&s;es, 'tis a Ce&s;tern almo&s;t &s;quare,
about &s;ix Foot each way, and of a con&s;idera|ble
depth, always brimful of Water, &s;upplied
by the Drops which falls from above; but
that which is to be admired in it is this, tho'
the Water be con&s;tantly droping, and is con|tinually
brimful, yet it never runs over, as
<PB N="20" REF="19">
our Guides told us. Round about this Hall
hangs four Stones re&s;embling four Fletches
of Bacon, for the out&s;ide is blacki&s;h and the
in&s;ide white; in this place the Daughter of
the old Sorcere&s;s had took up her Re&s;idence,
and appears to your eye like the Statue of a
Woman that is great with Child; &s;he is of a
different colour from her Mother, being
much more dusky than &s;he is: But nothing
more pretty to behold here than tho&s;e
which they call <HI>The Organ Pipes</HI> placed upon
one &s;ide of the Rock, and are very like to
tho&s;e we have in our Churches, &s;ome being
of bigger and &s;ome of le&s;&s;er Dimen&s;ions, in
the middle of a good rea&s;onable thickne&s;s
though at the ends &s;harp and &s;lender. After
&s;ome more Difficulties in our Pa&s;&s;age, and no
le&s;s dangerous than before, we came into a|nother
part of the Cave more &s;trange than
any we had yet &s;een. 'Tis a place they call
the <HI>Dancing Room,</HI> &s;o well Contriv'd, and &s;o
curiou&s;ly &s;et forth, that <HI>Nature</HI> hath wrought
here what Art could never do or compre|hend,
both above and below; if you look up,
the variety of Colours which are there to be
&s;een by the light of the Candles, and the
checquered Configurations of the Rock,
which is now very high above your head;
will both fea&s;t your Eyes and refre&s;h your
Body, which by that time is &s;ufficiently wea|ried
by the tediou&s;ne&s;s, as well as the trouble
<PB N="21" REF="19">
of the Pa&s;&s;age; for there is &s;o great a gli&s;ter|ing,
&s;uch a Lu&s;tre as it were of Silver and
precious Stones round about you, that you
would be ready to mi&s;take your &s;elf, and
think that you were in the Palace of &s;ome
great Monarch of the Earth, and not in &s;uch
a di&s;mal Cave; and if you look down, there
you will find no &s;tony, hard, ruggy Tract to
perplex you, but a fine, even, &s;andy Flower,
and indeed beyond expectation, that we who
had beheld &s;uch craggy Stones and dange|rous
Pa&s;&s;ages &s;hould at la&s;t arrive in &s;o &s;pa|cious
and delightful a place; they told us,
That it was very u&s;ual for Gentlemen and
Ladies, that lived thereabouts, to bring Mu|&s;ick
and Dance here, the Mu&s;ick making a
more &s;weeter Melody than ordinary; we
pau&s;ed and breathed a little here, delighting
our &s;elves as well with it, as al&s;o with the
re&s;emblance of a Chimney, which we took
really to be one, it being of that fa&s;hion, and
having in it a kind of black moi&s;t Matter,
which, if you touch it, will &s;tick to your fin|gers,
and black them like Soot, and yet no
fire was ever known to be there: But we
were not as yet &s;atisfied, though we were a|bove
300 Yards under the Ground, and in a
mo&s;t horrid Dungeon, but went &s;till farther
to a place termed <HI>The Seller,</HI> that is curiou&s;|ly
vaulted, and 'tis very u&s;ual to carry Bottles
of Wine and drink there upon a &s;tone Table
<PB N="22" REF="20">
which is form'd in it of natural Stone; in
this place lies al&s;o a great Stone which they
call <HI>The Great Gun,</HI> the nature of it is this,
take it but up in your hands, and let it fall
down to the ground, and a great Gun can|not
give a louder Report. We tried the Ex|periment
thrice, but we thought the very
Rock we were under would have rent in
pieces about our Ears, yet they that were
half way the Cave, or at the Mouth of it,
heard nothing of any noi&s;e at all; this we
found experimentally true, for one of the
Per&s;ons that accompanied us in our Journey,
&s;taying a little di&s;tance in the Cave, being
unwilling to venter any farther, a&s;&s;ured us
when we came back, that he had not
heard any noi&s;e at all; we ventured a lit|tle
farther, and at the end of the Celler,
when we had gone down &s;ome few Steps,
we found a great Rivolet &s;everal Yards deep,
but as clear as Chry&s;tial, and plea&s;ant to the
Ta&s;te, but very cold; it gave a Period to our
Journey. It runs under ground, though its
Head from whence it fir&s;t &s;prings is like that
of the River <HI>Nilus</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which is not yet,
or at lea&s;t very difficult to be di&s;covered,
conveying it &s;elf out of this Cave, it &s;ets
30 Mills on work after it comes into the ad|jacent
County, as we were informed. When
we had got thus far, and almo&s;t a Mile un|der
ground, as our Guides told us, we be|gan
<PB N="23" REF="20">
to think how we &s;hould return and get
out &s;afe, being afraid to find the &s;ame diffi|culty
and trouble we had encountered with
in our Entrance; for tho' the Place was &s;ome|what
re&s;embling an Infernal Abby&s;s, and
our Pa&s;&s;age into it proved &s;o trouble&s;ome
and irk&s;ome, yet we came back without any
toil, or rather with great facility and plea|&s;ure,
notwith&s;tanding 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to find
out the way without a Guide, there being
&s;o many Turnings and Windings; nor could
the Guides them&s;elves, without a light,
find the way out of this forlorn place, where|by
they &s;teer their Cour&s;e: However, at
la&s;t, we made a &s;hift to creep up again to the
top of the Rock, ju&s;t as merry <HI>Lucian</HI> tells us
old <HI>Menippus</HI> did out of a hole in <HI>Lebadia,</HI>
after he returned from Hell, and had ended
the Di&s;cour&s;es with the Gho&s;ts below. Thus
have I given you a &s;mall Relation of this
wonderful Rarerity.</P>
<P><HI>GLASTENBURY</HI> lies four Miles from
<HI>Wells,</HI> a Place of great Antiquity, as any
what&s;oever in the Kingdom; for the Origi|nal
thereof is deducted from <HI>Jo&s;eph of Arima|thea,</HI>
who, together with <HI>Mary Magdalen, La|zarus</HI>
and <HI>Martha,</HI> was &s;ent hither by St. <HI>Phi|lip</HI>
the Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> to preach the
Go&s;pel about 63 Years after Chri&s;t, and
were buried here them&s;elves, upon which
account it was, in proce&s;s of time, very
<PB N="24" REF="21">
much enlarged by pious Princes, King <HI>Ina</HI>
who was the fir&s;t here, that cau&s;ed his Sub|jects
to pay <HI>Peter-Pence</HI> to <HI>Rome,</HI> rebuilt
the Abby which was then gone much to
decay; to which he added a very fine and
&s;tately Church, dedicated to Chri&s;t, S. <HI>Peter,</HI>
and S. <HI>Paul;</HI> and that which is very remar|kable
here, is the Kitchin of the Abbots, be|ing
20 foot high, built in the form of a Py|ramid
of pure Stone, and divided into four
Angles or Corners; to each of which were
allotted a Window and a Chimney: But all
of them went to rack, and were razed to the
ground, and there is nothing left now but
the Ruins to proclaim its former Glory and
Magnificence; and to reckon up all the Kings
of the We&s;t-Saxons that were buried here
would be too tedious.</P>
<P>The <HI>Walnut-Tree</HI> and <HI>Holy Hawthorn.</HI> But
to come nearer to our own days, here was
&s;omething not many years &s;ince very notable
and &s;trange: The <HI>Walnut-Tree</HI> in the holy
Churchyard, that did never put out any
Leaves before S. <HI>Barnabas</HI> day, and upon that
very day grew rank and full of Leaves; and
the <HI>Hawthorn</HI> in <HI>Wiral</HI> Park, that always on
<HI>Chri&s;tmas-day</HI> &s;prouted forth as if in <HI>May,</HI> both
de&s;erve Credit, as well as Admiration: For
the truth of both the&s;e we were credibly in|form'd
of divers Per&s;ons Inhabitants of this
Place; and that the&s;e Trees, through the
<PB N="25" REF="21">
Malice and Fury of &s;ome Per&s;on in the late
Warrs, were cut down and de&s;troy'd: But
many things here are very ob&s;ervable, which
I have not room to in&s;ert.</P>
<P><HI>BATH.</HI> It lying low and all &s;ides &s;ur|rounded
with Hills, the Town is well water|ed
with Springs, though &s;ome of them are
&s;ulphureous and bad to the Ta&s;t; environ'd
with a Wall, very commodious for its Mar|ket-place,
and hand&s;omly adorn'd with three
Churches; one whereof is very large and
&s;patious, built in the form of a Cathedral;
the Steeple is four-&s;quare, and hath a Ring
of very tunable Bells, and a Quire with very
&s;weet Organs; and in it are erected &s;everal
antient and &s;tately Monuments of Per&s;ons of
Quality, and Bi&s;hops of this See, who have
been noble Benefactors to it; 'tis governed
by a Mayor and Aldermen, and the A&s;&s;izes
are generally kept there in the Summer
time: But that which is mo&s;t remarkable
here, and cau&s;eth a Concour&s;e in the Sum|mer
not only of the Nobility and Gentry,
but of the Commonalty too, from all parts
of the Nation hither, are the <HI>Baths,</HI> which are
not inferiour to any that ever <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>France</HI>
could glory in; they have without que&s;tion
cured many weak and feeble Limbs, and do
cure divers Di&s;ea&s;es which are incident and
de&s;tructive to Humane Nature; by cau&s;ing
Men to &s;weat either more or le&s;s, propor|tionably
<PB N="26" REF="22">
to their Di&s;tempers. Who they
were that fir&s;t found them out is very uncer|tain,
whether <HI>Bleyden</HI> alias <HI>Bladud</HI> the Son of
<HI>Rudhudibras</HI> the Magician, or <HI>Julius Coe&s;ar,</HI>
I &s;hall not undertake to determine the Con|trover&s;ie:
However they are of very great
Antiquity, and 'tis many hundred years &s;ince
their powerful Vertues were fir&s;t di&s;covered,
though they are all different in their Nature,
as well as their Operation; as the learned
Dr. <HI>Stubbs</HI> by divers Experiments a&s;&s;ures us.
The Baths are in number &s;ix; the King and
Queens Baths, the <HI>Cro&s;s Bath,</HI> the <HI>Hot Bath,</HI>
the <HI>Leper's Bath,</HI> and the <HI>Hor&s;e:</HI> That which
is the Chief is the <HI>Cro&s;s Bath,</HI> the Water
whereof being more mild than the other,
the Orders are very &s;trict and regular. And
Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality of the Nation
chu&s;e to bath them&s;elves here, and to drink
the Water thereof; hard by this &s;tands the
<HI>Hot Bath,</HI> not much frequented &s;ave by tho&s;e
who having quite lo&s;t the U&s;e of their Limbs,
come hither to &s;eek remedy: Not far from
this is that they call the <HI>Leper's Bath,</HI> which
is believed to be very efficacious again&s;t that
&s;preading Di&s;ea&s;e: And an Ho&s;pital, or Spit|tle,
built by <HI>Reginald</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Bath,</HI> for the
U&s;e and Benefit of poor, aged, decrepid Peo|ple.
About the middle of the Town, near
to the great Church are the King and Queens
Baths, the Water of the one flowing into
<PB N="27" REF="22">
the other; and the difference is, that the
King's Bath is large, and the Queens le&s;&s;er
in circumference; and I was credibly infor|med,
that there hath been found here an an|tient
Statue of <HI>Hercules,</HI> among&s;t other great
Monuments of Antiquity, holding a Serpent
in his hand; which was found in the Ruins
of a famous Temple, that once &s;tood here,
near this place: And it might be thought
very convenient, as well as rea&s;onable, that
<HI>Hercules,</HI> who expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch diffi|culties
and manifold dangers, and underwent
&s;uch hard and un&s;upportable Labours, &s;hould
now and then ea&s;e and refre&s;h his weary
Limbs by &s;uch Purgations as the Baths could
afford him. In this, and other Baths, hang
divers Crutches of lame and decrepit Per&s;ons,
which they left behind them as Trophies of
their Recovery, being perfectly cured of their
Lamene&s;s and Infirmity, and re&s;tored again
to their former Health and Strength. La&s;t
of all, that which is called the <HI>Hor&s;e Bath,</HI>
is very effectual for the Cure of lame and
foundred Hor&s;es, and the removal of &s;ome
other Di&s;tempers. Thus have I given a
&s;hort account of the Bath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Many things
there are more in this County very ob&s;erv|able
for all Travellers to take notice of,
which I think too tedious to relate.</P>

its &s;tately Palaces; the great Concour&s;e of

Wonder if both the Counties of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and
<HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> do contend which of them may be
mo&s;t glorious and happy, in its Superiority
over them; and yet neither of them can at|tain
to that Honour, it being both City and
County of it&s;elf, and having particular Pri|vileges,
Immunities, and Laws of its own:
'Tis governed by a Mayor and two Sheriffs,
twelve Aldermen, with other Mini&s;ters and
Officers befitting its dignity; 'tis environ'd
with a double Wall, and adorn'd with two
navigable Rivers, <HI>Avon</HI> at Spring-Tides is
11 or 12 Fathom deep, and <HI>Frome;</HI> over

is very hard to determine, but it &s;eems to
have been of latter years, becau&s;e we find it
no where &s;poken of by Hi&s;torians in the times
of the <HI>Danes,</HI> when they made their Invade

at the time when <HI>Harold</HI> is &s;aid to have
&s;ailed from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with a great Navy, into
<HI>Wales;</HI> which was about 213 years before
our Saviour's Incarnation. <HI>Robert,</HI> Bi&s;hop of

from that time it hath received great En|largment,

which is the Cathedral, and Mother-Church,
dedicated to S. <HI>Au&s;tin,</HI> and endow|ed

&s;omewhat greater, and the third a Mile off
as a Camp with fine Trenches containing near
ten Acres called <HI>Maiden-Ca&s;tle,</HI> which, in all

That it is a Province not much infe|rior
to any in <HI>England,</HI> being divided into
three &s;everal Parts, of which I have made
&s;ome mention before. It is in all parts &s;o
&s;ufficiently fruitful of all things nece&s;&s;ary for
the u&s;e of Man, and if we will take the pains
to cour&s;e over the Vallies, we &s;hall find the
Earth groaning under the burdens of boun|tiful
<HI>Ceres,</HI> and the Fields and Meadows in
conte&s;t which &s;hould &s;hine mo&s;t gay and glo|rious;
if we range the Woods and Hills, we
&s;hall hear &s;uch charming Melodies by the
mutual reciprecation of Birds and Trees, that
we &s;hould fancy all had got the knack of
Speaking and Pratling, Groves being now
become vi&s;ible to us; if we be &s;o curious
as to dig into the Entrails of the Earth, and
take a view of the recondite Trea&s;ures, we
&s;hall find plenty of Iron-Ore in the South
parts of this County, and great Queries of
Stone in &s;everal places; al&s;o towards the
North &s;ide they dig out of the Earth plenty
of excellent fat Chalk, which they u&s;e to
lay upon their Land for the enriching of it,
and cau&s;eth it to bring forth great Crops of
Corn: If we be taken with the harmonious
Murmurs of Brooks and gentle Rivers there
are &s;everal, the Banks of the Noble River of
<HI>Thames</HI> on the North &s;ide, and the River <HI>Med|way</HI>
which comes out of <HI>Surrey</HI> glides along
for many Miles together on the South &s;ide
<PB N="56" REF="37">
of this County, and takes its cour&s;e through
almo&s;t the middle of the County, and doth
not run &s;wift in many places, but glides &s;oft|ly,
admiring, as it were, the plea&s;antne&s;s of
its Soil; there is al&s;o at <HI>Newel</HI> in the
Pari&s;h of <HI>Orpington</HI> the fine&s;t Spings undoub|tedly
in the Kingdom, both for the clear|ne&s;s
of its Water, and the ri&s;ing up of it in
&s;uch abundance, that within two Furlongs
of the Head it drives a Mill, and afterwards
is called by the Name of <HI>Cray River.</HI> Mo&s;t

&s;orts of Fi&s;h to gratifie the Pallate, and all
the Towns and Villages are well inhabited,
having a great many very fine Seats of No|blemen

<P>One word or two I mu&s;t I &s;ay in relation
to <HI>Maid&s;tone.</HI> 'Tis the principal Town in the

near the middle of the County upon
the River <HI>Medway,</HI> which renders it &s;o plea|&s;ant

might be &s;ufficient to &s;et forth all the other
Parts of it. Leaving this place, we &s;oon af|ter

that they were compelled by one Enemy to
&s;urrender to the other, by tru&s;ting to the

<P><HI>YARMOUTH,</HI> which entertained us
with a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect, the Haven being as
commodious as the Town is beautiful, and
is fortified both by Art and Nature, for al|though
it be environed almo&s;t round with
Water on the We&s;t &s;ide by the River <HI>Yare,</HI>
from whence it borrows its Name, which
hath a Drawbridge over it, and from other
parts with the Ocean, unle&s;s it be North|ward

received its beginning from the Ruins of old
<HI>Garianum</HI> which was near this place, after
which, in a &s;hort time, as we were informed,
built this new Town which grew potent
and populous, and they &s;trengthened it with
a Wall, and grew very numerous in Inha|bitants,
and there happened a fearful and
&s;udden Pe&s;tilence, which in the &s;pace of a
Year brought above &s;even Thou&s;and Men
and Women to their Graves, all which was
faithfully recorded in an ancient Table, which
formerly u&s;ed to hang up in their Church,
but &s;ince re&s;tored to its primitive Lu&s;tre, and
their Wealth hath increa&s;ed, and 'tis now a
place of great Merchandize and Traffick, but
e&s;pecially renowned for its Fi&s;hery of <HI>Her|rings</HI>

great plenty, and by their care and indu&s;try
are &s;alted and dried in particular Hou&s;es de|&s;igned

<HI>NORWICH</HI> is one of the mo&s;t renow|ned
Cities in our <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> I&s;land, for whether
we con&s;ider the Wealth of the Citizens, the
Number of Inhabitants, the great Conference
of Foreigners, the &s;tately Structures, and
beautiful Churches, the obliging Carriage of
the Gentry, and the Indu&s;try of the Com|mons,
do all concur to illu&s;trate and digni|fie
it. 'Tis &s;ituated on the brow of a Hill,
and environed with a Wall in which are pla|ced
divers Turrets, and twelve Gates to give
entrance into the City, unle&s;s it be on the
Ea&s;t &s;ide, where the River <HI>Yare</HI> after it hath,
with many windings, watered the mo&s;t part
of the City, having four Draw-bridges for
People to pa&s;s over, and is a farther defence
by rea&s;on of its deep Channel, and high
Banks; 'tis reported to be a Mile and a half
in length, and half as much in breadth. It
hath had great Misfortunes, and &s;uffered ve|ry
much by the <HI>Danes</HI> when they took their
range in the&s;e parts, and after <HI>William the
Conqueror</HI> had &s;ettled the <HI>Britti&s;h</HI> Crown up|on
his head, it &s;uffered much more, which
is too tedious to relate, but in &s;ucceeding
Ages it began to recruit its Strength, and
hath flouri&s;hed exceedingly. King <HI>Henry</HI> the
Fir&s;t permitted the Citizens to Wall their Ci|ty,
and King <HI>Richard</HI> the Second gave them
a Grant for the Tran&s;portation of Wor&s;ted,
and to advance their Trade which was ex|treamly
<PB N="66" REF="42">
eclip&s;ed. King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth re|newed
their Charter, and conferred on them
the Honour to chu&s;e every Year a Mayor
for their Magi&s;trate, whereas by a former
Order from King <HI>Stephen</HI> they were only go|verned
by Coroners and Baliffs. It contai|neth
thirty two Pari&s;hes, forty two Chappels
and Churches, of which the Cathedral is the
faire&s;t and chiefe&s;t, the fir&s;t Stone of which
was laid by Bi&s;hop <HI>Herbert,</HI> in the Reign of
King <HI>William Rufus,</HI> who Tran&s;lated the E|pi&s;copal
See from <HI>Thetford</HI> to this place, and
procured a Grant to have it confirmed the
Mother-Church of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> en|dowing
it with great Revenues, and it is a ve|ry
&s;tately and magnificent Structure, but mo&s;t
famous for its Roof which runs aloft over

the life the whole Hi&s;tory of the Bible in di|vers
little Images, curiou&s;ly carved and ador|ned,
from the Creation of the World, to the

of the Holy Gho&s;t, with the perfect re|&s;emblance
of our Lord's Crucifiction and Re|&s;urrection,
and divers other things. The
Market, Cro&s;s and Cloi&s;ter of the Cathedral
are the faire&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> There is a great

whil&s;t &s;he crowns his Indu&s;try with a plenti|ful

and various Effects: In a word, here is
nothing wanting for Plea&s;ure, Profit, or De|light;

the County towards the I&s;le of <HI>Ely</HI> lying
&s;omewhat low is moi&s;t and fenny, yet the
gentle Gales which are frequently &s;tirring,
drive away all Mi&s;ts and Fogs which may

&s;ince our wi&s;e Ance&s;tors thought good and
convenient to plant a Colony here, and place
one of the Eyes of our Nation in this Spot

<P><HI>CAMBRIDGE</HI> was formerly called
<HI>Grantbridge,</HI> from a fair large Bridge made o|ver
the River <HI>Grant,</HI> which is now called <HI>Cam,</HI>
from whence the Town it &s;elf receives its
Name. It is increa&s;ed much by the Ruins
of <HI>Grance&s;ter</HI> &s;ometime a famous City, &s;itu|tuate
a little above a Mile from this place,
and the Ca&s;tle that is beyond the River, the
Ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een, was built,
as ancient Records te&s;tifie, in the fir&s;t Year
of <HI>William the Conqueror,</HI> or in the fir&s;t Year

Streets, adorned with fifteen &s;everal magni|ficent
Colleges and Halls, each of which are
liberally endowed with large Revenues, more

dilligent pur&s;uit of all kind of Learning;
here are fifteen Churches, be&s;ides private
Chappels in every College, the chief of
which is called St. <HI>Mary's</HI> Church, &s;et a part
particularly for the u&s;e of the Univer&s;ity,

Memory of our mo&s;t pious Benefa|ctors

their great Munificence and mo&s;t memoral

governed by a Mayor and Aldermen, and
the A&s;&s;izes, for the mo&s;t part, are kept here
for the County, which is very profitable to
the Town, and 'tis ob&s;ervable that one High
Sheriff &s;erves for both the Counties of <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>

it, and that is the great Fair annually
kept within a Mile of it in <HI>September,</HI> called
<PB N="72" REF="45">
by the Name of <HI>Sturbridge</HI>-Fair; from whence
it received its Denomination is uncertain,

when you are within the limits, you would
rather be ready to imagine your &s;elf in &s;ome
great Town, by the variety of Shops and
multiplicity of Booths, than in a wide open
Feild, tho&s;e Booths are always built for the
time in which it la&s;ts, which is well nigh a
Fortnight; neither are you pre&s;ented only
with Booths upon the Land, but Booths on
the Water too, there being particular Con|trivances
in the Boats for Rooms and &s;ecret
retirements all covered above, for the conve|niency
of Strangers which re&s;ort thither,
and indeed here is always a great Re&s;orting
of People from mo&s;t Parts of this Nation.</P>
<P>Near unto <HI>Cambridge</HI> on the South Ea&s;t

called <HI>Gogmagog.</HI> On top of them is a very
large Fort, entrenched, &s;trengthened with a
three-fold Rampire.</P>
<P>There are contained in the Shire, eight
Market-Towns, and one hundred and &s;ixty
three Pari&s;hes.</P>
<P>Having paid our Devotions, and taken a

on the Ea&s;t. 'Tis a very fruitful
County both for Corn and Gra&s;s, and is wa|tered
by two plea&s;ant Rivers <HI>Avon</HI> and <HI>Ou&s;e.</HI>
The fir&s;t Village we arrived at in this Coun|ty
was <HI>Fenny-Stanton,</HI> but found nothing ob|&s;ervable,
we went from hence to</P>
<P><HI>GODMANCHESTER,</HI> a very great
Country-Town, and of as great a Name for
Tillage; &s;ituate in an open Ground, of a
light Mould, and bending for the Sun. There
is not a Town in all <HI>England</HI> that hath more
&s;tout and lu&s;ty Husbandmen, or more Plows

they have in former time received the Kings
of <HI>England,</HI> as they pa&s;&s;ed in their Progre&s;s
this way, with Nine-&s;core Plows, brought
forth in a ru&s;tical kind of pomp for a gal|lant
&s;hew.</P>
<P>Soon after King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t came in|to
<HI>England,</HI> here the Bailiffs of the Town
pre&s;ented him with &s;eventy Teem of Hor&s;es,
all traced to fair new Plows, in &s;hew of their
Husbandry, of which when his Maje&s;ty de|manded
the Rea&s;on, he was an&s;wered, <HI>That
it was their ancient Cu&s;tom, when&s;oever any King
<PB N="74" REF="46">
of</HI> England <HI>pa&s;&s;ed through their Town, &s;o to pre|&s;ent
him.</HI> Be&s;ides they added, <HI>That they held
their Lands by that Tenure, being the King's Te|nants.</HI>
His Maje&s;ty took it well, and <HI>Bad
them u&s;e well their Plows, being glad he was
Landlord of &s;o many good Husbandmen in one

<P>It is mention'd in Hi&s;tory to have been a
flouri&s;hing City, and the old <HI>Roman</HI> Coins
which have been digged up there do atte&s;t
its Antiquity, and that a Bi&s;hop did former|ly
re&s;ide in this place, when it was in that
condition.</P>
<P><HI>HUNTINGDON</HI> is about half a Mile
di&s;tant from this place, and is the chief Town
of the County, &s;ituated upon the River <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI>
over which &s;tands a Bridge made of Stone
which gives entrance into it; the Hou&s;es are
fair, and the Streets large; 'tis adorned with
four Churches. and had formely an ancient

a high Hill, &s;tands the remains of a Ca&s;tle
which was built about the Year of Chri&s;t 917,
afterwards <HI>David,</HI> King of <HI>Scots,</HI> waging War
again&s;t King <HI>Stephen</HI> upon the account of
<HI>Maud</HI> the Empre&s;s, who was his Niece, this
then was given upon &s;ome certain Terms to
the <HI>Scotch</HI> King, who did exceedingly beau|tifie
and &s;trengthen it, by making &s;trong Ram|pers
and Fortifications round about it, but
<PB N="75" REF="46">
<HI>Henry</HI> the Second finding it, in proce&s;s of
time, a Cage for Rebels and Ring-leaders to
Sedition, at la&s;t quite demoli&s;hed it; from
the top of the Hill is a very plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect
for &s;ome Miles. The Town is governed by
a Mayor and Aldermen, and the A&s;&s;izes are
held here twice a Year for the Shire, and
wants no kind of Provi&s;ion to entertain Tra|vellers
who re&s;ort hether out of the Nor|thern
parts, the great Road to the City of
<HI>London</HI> lying through this Town.</P>
<P>In this Town, in the Year 1599, was that
U&s;urper and Religious Cheat <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI>
Born and Educated, whom though we have
rea&s;on to cur&s;e his very Name, and dete&s;t
his Memory as odious and execrable, yet
&s;ince pro&s;perous Succe&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t cruel
Tirants, makes others inqui&s;itive after tho&s;e
Per&s;ons which they did &s;o fortunately attend.
It will not be ami&s;s to tell the World that
this place gave him his fir&s;t Being, who, <HI>Ne|ro</HI>
like, de&s;troyed his Father and his Mother
too; the Father of his Country, and his Coun|try
too, being a Murderer of the one, and a
Plague to the other, who was of &s;o unparal|lel'd
and ba&s;e a Temper of Mind from his
Cradle to his Grave, that nothing could &s;tay

what carried even the World before it Con|fu&s;ion

<HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire.</HI> 'Tis
more venerable for its Antiquity than its
comeline&s;s, or pre&s;ent beauty. I find that
about the Year 680, it was a Bi&s;hop's Seat,
though in few Years after the Sea was Tran|&s;lated,
and the Dignity being taken away
from the Town, it began to go much to de|cay,
but in the time of the <HI>Normans</HI> it flou|ri&s;hed
exceedingly, and encrea&s;ed mightily
in Inhabitants, yet afterwards in the Reign
of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Second it was again invol|ved
in great Calamities and Di&s;a&s;ters. Here
is to be &s;een an ancient Ho&s;pital, in the Chap|pel
whereof <HI>Henry,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Hen|ry,</HI>
his Son, the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> lie In|terred,
for that Duke being very Aged, and
<PB N="78" REF="48">
being willing to give &s;ome vi&s;ible Te&s;timo|ny
of his Charity, built this Ho&s;pital for the
U&s;e and Maintenance of divers poor, aged,
decreped Per&s;ons of both Sexes; and on the
other &s;ide, among&s;t tho&s;e flowry Meadows
which the River <HI>Sore</HI> enricheth with its bub|ling
Stream, <HI>Robert,</HI> the crook-backt Earl of
<HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> built a Mona&s;tery very &s;pacious and
magnificent, and Dedicated it to the Virgin
<HI>Mary,</HI> and endowed it with large Revenues.
In the Chappel of this Mona&s;tery lay interr'd
the great and pui&s;&s;ant Cardinal <HI>Wool&s;ey,</HI> who
being at fir&s;t a poor Man's Son of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> in
<HI>Suffolk,</HI> was rai&s;ed by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth,
for his great Parts and Learning, to the grea|te&s;t
Degree of Honour in this Nation, being
advanced to be Lord Chancellor, of <HI>England,</HI>
and pre&s;ented with a Cardinal's Cap from
the Pope, and the unknown Incomes and
Revenues, and by his great Trea&s;ures and
Mints of Money, atchieved more magnificent
Acts than ever any Prelate did before him,
for he erected the Royal Palace of <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI>
be&s;ides two famous Colleges, the one
at this Native Town, and the other a mo&s;t
glorious Structure called <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> Col|lege
in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and for the height of his Li|ving
and Attendance, it is very elegantly &s;et
forth by the writer of his Life: But notwith|&s;tanding
he was the Favourite of his Prince,
and the Darling of Fortune, and &s;ued to by
<PB N="79" REF="48">
Foreigners, and his own Country-men too,
as to be the only Per&s;on to apply to in all ac|counts,
yet true it is, that Fortune very oft
&s;ets great Per&s;ons upon the Hill of Honour,
thereby to precipitate them with the greater
Violence; we find this lofty Cardinal could
no way &s;ecure him&s;elf from the reach of fret|ting
Envy, and learn'd by the mutability of
his own Condition, for being retired into the
Country, after he &s;eeing his Fortunes began
to ebb at Court, having the Great Seal took
from him by the King's Order, and was af|terwards
&s;ent for by the Lieutenant of the

at the Earl of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI>'s hou&s;e in <HI>Sheffeild</HI>-Park,
which being accompanied with a Fe|ver

to be a place of very great Antiquity,
This Ca&s;tle held out a Siege by the <HI>Danes</HI> a|gain&s;t
<HI>Alfred,</HI> and it was then called <HI>Snotten|ham,</HI>
and now <HI>Nottingham.</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the

his plea&s;ure; though I find too in the Life
of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> that <HI>Robert,</HI> Earl of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI>
invaded this Town with a great Power, and
when mo&s;t of the Town&s;men were &s;lain and
burnt in the Churches whither they fled for
refuge; there is a Story of one of them who
was richer than the re&s;t, and being forced
to return to his own hou&s;e by the Soldiers
that had taken him, to &s;hew them where all
his Trea&s;ures lay, he bringing them into a
Celler, and whil&s;t they were bu&s;y in break|ing
open Locks and Coffers, conveyed him|&s;elf
away, making the Door fa&s;t after him,

being thirty in number, peri&s;hed all in
the Flames, which ketching hold of other
Buildings joining to it, almo&s;t burnt up the

King of the <HI>Scots,</HI> who was here confined;
the relation of which I &s;hall &s;et down as brief|ly
as I can.</P>
<P>After King <HI>Edward</HI> the Second had been
Depo&s;ed and Murdered by the Plots of his

the Third, her Son, had Reigned about four
Years, a Parliament was called at <HI>Nottingham,</HI>
where this <HI>Roger Mortimore,</HI> who was then
the Queen's mo&s;t e&s;pecial Favourite, was in
<PB N="87" REF="52">
&s;uch Glory and Renown, that it was beyond
all compari&s;on: None &s;o much Lord Para|mount,
as the Earl of <HI>March:</HI> None appears
in &s;o great an Equippage, and attended with
&s;o honourable a Retinue, as the Earl of <HI>March;</HI>
&s;o that the King's Train was inferiour to his,
and his Maje&s;ty's Glory eclip&s;ed, by the
Pomp and Grandeur of one of his Nobles,
for he very oft would pre&s;ume to go fore|mo&s;t,
and his own Officers, and was &s;o ex|ceeding
proud and haughty, as to make all
Per&s;ons cringe, and do as great Homage to
him, as to Maje&s;ty it &s;elf; nay, he undertook
to Order and Di&s;po&s;e of all Per&s;ons and Af|fairs
to his own Will and Plea&s;ure; and here|upon
one day he very &s;harply rebuked the
Earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the King's Cou&s;in, for pre|&s;uming
to appoint Lodgings for certain No|blemen
near the Court, without his particu|lar
Licen&s;e and A&s;&s;ignation, and having di&s;|lodged
the Earl, with &s;ome other Per&s;ons of
very great Quality, and removed them a Mile
out of Town, he did by this means &s;o in|cen&s;e
the Nobility again&s;t him, that they be|gan
to pry more narrowly into his Actions,
and being enraged to &s;ee his Pride and U|&s;urpation
of his great Prerogatives, they u|nanimou&s;ly
held again&s;t him, and gave it out
among&s;t the People, <HI>That this</HI> Mortimore <HI>was
the Queen's Gallant, and the King's Ma&s;ter, and
&s;ought by all means he po&s;&s;ibly could to de&s;troy the
<PB N="88" REF="53">
Royal Blood, and to U&s;urp the Crown;</HI> which
Report did &s;o work upon &s;ome of the King's
mo&s;t tru&s;ty Friends, that they got <HI>Robert Hol|land,</HI>
who had a long time been Governor
of the Ca&s;tle, and knew well all the &s;ecret
Corners therein, to &s;wear Secrecy to them,
and Fidelity to the King, and accordingly to
a&s;&s;i&s;t them in tho&s;e De&s;igns they had in hand:
Whereupon one night King <HI>Edward</HI> lying
without the Ca&s;tle, both he, and his Friends,
were brought by Torch-light through a &s;e|cret
place under ground, beginning a far off
from the &s;aid Ca&s;tle, ('tis the Vault which is
&s;till called <HI>Mortimore's Hole)</HI> till they came e|ven
to the Queen's Chamber, which, by
chance, they found open; being armed with
naked Swords, in they ru&s;hed, leaving the
King in the &s;ame po&s;ture at the Door; being
entered into the Privy-chamber, they found
the Earl of <HI>March</HI> undre&s;&s;ed, ready to go to
bed to the Queen, but they cro&s;&s;ed his De|&s;ign,
and cool'd his Courage, halling him a|way
by force, upon which the Queen cried
out, <HI>Good Son, take pitty upon gentle</HI> Mortimore,
&s;u&s;pecting her Son to be there in the compa|ny:
The Keys of the Ca&s;tle were pre&s;ently
called for, and every place, withal the Fur|niture
committed into the King's Hands, and
<HI>Mortimore</HI> was forthwith &s;ent to the Tower,
who, being Tried by his Peers, Arraign'd
and found Guilty, was hanged upon the
<PB N="89" REF="53">
common Gallows two Days and two Nights.
The Articles that were brought again&s;t him
were divers, though his Familiarity with the
Queen, his Treachery to his King, and his
great Service to <HI>David,</HI> King of the <HI>Scots,</HI> was
the chief, whil&s;t he al&s;o burnt the Charters
by which the <HI>Scotch</HI> King &s;tood obliged to
do Homage to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and there|upon
en&s;ued a great War betwixt them; for
King <HI>David</HI> being &s;purred on by the <HI>French</HI>
King Invaded <HI>England,</HI> and having made a
great Road into the Northern Counties, and
&s;poiling and burning every where as they
went along, at length, at <HI>Durham</HI> his Army
was routed, and him&s;elf taken Pri&s;oner, be|ing
fir&s;t &s;ent to the Tower, afterward com|mitted
to this Ca&s;tle, where, during his con|&s;inement,
he engraved upon the Walls of his
Deportment, the Hi&s;tory of our Saviour's
Death and Pa&s;&s;ion, the Relicts of which are
&s;till to be &s;een. After eleven Years Impri|&s;onment,
he was re&s;tored again&s;t to his King|dom,
by paying a good Ran&s;om for his Li|berty;
but before he returned, he was one
of the four Kings that was nobly Treated by
<HI>Henry Picard,</HI> a Vintner, then Lord Mayor of
<HI>London:</HI> The&s;e were the four Kings, <HI>Edward</HI>
the Third, King of <HI>England; John,</HI> King of

&s;ame Table; this was about the Year 1358.
But before I leave this Town, I cannot but
take notice of one thing more memorable in
our Age, this being the fir&s;t place where
King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t &s;et up his Royal Stan|dard
again&s;t the Rebels in the late unhappy
Wars, and when the King's Forces were for|ced,
to leave it, the Ca&s;tle was quite demo|li&s;hed.
We went from hence to view the

<P>Having plea&s;ured our &s;elves with the An|tiquities
of this Town, we took Hor&s;e and
went to vi&s;it the Well and ancient Chair of
<HI>Robin-Hood,</HI> which is about a Mile within the
Fore&s;t of <HI>Shirwood:</HI> Being placed in that
Chair, we had a Cap, which, they &s;ay, was
his, very formally put upon our Heads, and
having performed the u&s;ual Ceremonies be|fitting
&s;o great a Solemnity, we received the
Freedom of the Chair, and were incorpora|ted
into the Society of that renowned Bro|therhood;
but that we may not receive &s;uch
Privileges without an honourable mention|ing
of the Per&s;ons that left them to Po&s;teri|ty;

and did relieve them very liberally with
what he got from the rich <HI>Carles:</HI> He kil|led
none, and by this means he did, for a

Subterraneons Cavarn, known by the Name

the further you go in, the more narrower
it is Contracted; within the Mouth of it
are &s;everal poor Cottages Erected, the top
of this Cave is an exceeding great Height,
and appears to the Eye as if it were Arched
above and Chequer'd with diver&s;ity of cul|loured
Stones. At the Entrance the poor Peo|ple
are very ready to attend with Candles,
and Lanthorns, to conduct Strangers in,
tho' it belonged to <HI>Satan</HI>'s Territories, and it
<PB N="100" REF="59">
is very Dark and Slippery by rea&s;on of &s;e|veral
Currants of Water which runs along
the Cave, which puts a &s;top to your Jour|ney;
there is a Story of a Shepherd that pa&s;t
over all the&s;e Currents, and at la&s;t came in|to
a very fair and delightful Meadow, which
&s;avours too much of a Romance to be cre|dited;
however, 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed could all the&s;e
Waters once be gone over, there might be

the top of which Cliff or Rock the Sand tho'
the Air be never &s;o Calm, doth continually
trickle to the bottom Night and Day, and
now and then great Stones fall down with a
very great Noi&s;e, and do much affright the

and Elde&s;t Son to <HI>Mountgomery,</HI> was taken in
his Rebellion again&s;t <HI>Henry</HI> the Fir&s;t, and
was bani&s;hed out of the Land; the King
took this Ca&s;tle into his own Hands; after

<HI>Wales.</HI> And by this means beginning to be
in great reque&s;t, the Inhabitants erected
a very large Church to make it more Fa|mous;
and in a little time, it excelled all its
Neighbourhood, and out-&s;hin'd them in Lu|&s;tre
and Dignity; for King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth

at the fir&s;t; but having pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e
Rocky parts, we began to find the County
more plea&s;ant to the Eye. We di&s;covered it
to be a fertile Soil, the Vallies thick with
Corn, and the Meadows abounding with
Gra&s;s, and well watered with Rivers, the
Hills covered with Sheep, and the Hedges
full of Apple-trees, which bear a &s;ort of
<PB N="97" REF="65">
Fruit, called <HI>Red Streaks,</HI> of which they
make the be&s;t Cyder in <HI>England;</HI> in a word,
we found it according to the u&s;ual report
which is made of it, to yield to no Coun|ty
in this Nation for three <HI>W. W. W.</HI> Wheat,
Wool and Waters, to which formerly might
have been added Wood, but the Iron Works
have de&s;troyed it very much, and made it
now become le&s;s plentiful. The fir&s;t Town
of Note we came to in this County was</P>
<P><HI>LEOMSTER,</HI> Is a Town of great Re|que&s;t
in this County, and is of great Anti|quity:
Some are of an Opinion, that it re|ceived
its Denomination from <HI>Linen, Hemp</HI> or
<HI>Flax;</HI> becau&s;e, that grows thereabouts in
plenty, but it may be &s;o called from <HI>Lana,</HI>
becau&s;e it is reported to have the be&s;t Wool
known by the Name of <HI>Leom&s;ter Ore,</HI> and is
&s;aid to make the fine&s;t Cloth in <HI>England,</HI>
and as its Wool makes the fine&s;t Cloth, &s;o
doth its Wheat the pure&s;t Bread; and they
&s;ay hereabouts, that for <HI>Leom&s;ter</HI> Bread, and
<HI>Weobly</HI> Beer, none can Compare. Concern|ing
the Town it is Situated in a plea&s;ant
Valley, and is Governed by a Bayliff and
Aldermen, and is Adorned with a very
hand&s;ome Hall, for the di&s;patching of pub|lick
Affairs. We went from hence to</P>
<P><HI>HEREFORD,</HI> The chief City hereof,

County, and Watered by two plea&s;ant Ri|vers
<PB N="98" REF="66">
<HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Lugg,</HI> which by their happy
Union not far from this City, advance her
Felicity and enrich her Soil: Antiquaries
are of an Opinion, that this City had its
Ri&s;e from <HI>Ariconium,</HI> which at this Day hath
no form at all of a Town, as having been
over-turned by an Earthquake, as &s;ome do
imagine it to have been in this Place, which
they now call <HI>Lenche&s;ter,</HI> &s;ome three Miles
di&s;tant from this City, which they conceive
to be &s;o from the Ruines of old Walls that
are here to be &s;een, as likewi&s;e from four
&s;quare Pareing Stones and thick Bricks, as
well as &s;everal Roman Coins digged up in
the Earth, though now all grown over with
Trees, Bu&s;hes and Brambles: We ob&s;erved
when we went to Vi&s;it this place, we &s;aw
&s;everal peices of an old Wall, which do Ar|gue
the place to continue in it very great re|mains
of Antiquity; however, her Si&s;ter <HI>He|reford,</HI>
which now is Beautiful by the pains
of others, claims rightly the Pre-eminence
before all other places in this County, wan|ting
nothing for Plea&s;ure and Profit to make
her Renowned. She is thought fir&s;t to have
&s;hewn her Head in the time of the <HI>Saxon,</HI>

Helps and Increa&s;e by Religion, and the

<PB N="99" REF="66">
put to death by <HI>Quendred, Offa</HI>'s

he had a Church built and dedicated to
him by <HI>Mil&s;red,</HI> a petty King of this County,
which after the E&s;tabli&s;hment of a Bi&s;hop's

<HI>Algarus</HI> had rai&s;ed a Rebellion again&s;t King

Sacked the City, and burnt the Cathedral;
afterwards the <HI>Normans,</HI> at the Ea&s;t end of
the Church by the River <HI>Wye,</HI> built a &s;trong
Ca&s;tle, and fortified the City with a Wall,

<P>Concerning &s;ome remarkable Things in

<P><HI>SUTTON WALLS.</HI> Among&s;t the

<HEAD>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire.</HEAD>
<P>Being within the Confines of this County,
we found it mo&s;t fertile, watered by the
River <HI>Severn,</HI> and be-&s;et with Woods and
thick Groves; 'tis happy in the enjoyment
of all things which are nece&s;&s;ary for the
U&s;e and Service of Man; the very Hedges

General, the Towns &s;tands thick together
in mo&s;t parts of this County, and &s;o 'tis
populous; the Hou&s;es numerous, and well
built, the Churches fair and hand&s;ome
and &s;o 'tis honourable; but that which is
one of the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ings of all is, the River
<HI>Severn;</HI> there is not any River in all our
Nation for its Channel broader, for a Stream
Swifter, and for Variety of Fi&s;h better &s;tock|ed,
though &s;ometimes it overflows the
Banks, and when it hath roved a great way
it retires back again, as it were, triumphing
over the Conque&s;t of the Land. This River
<HI>Severn,</HI> or <HI>Sabrina,</HI> was &s;o called from
<PB N="103" REF="68">
<HI>Sabenia,</HI> a fair Lady, concerning whom
there goes this Story; <HI>Loarnie,</HI> the elde&s;t
Son of <HI>Brutus,</HI> who came fir&s;t into <HI>Britain,</HI>
took to Wife the Daughter of the Duke of
<HI>Cornwall,</HI> but notwith&s;tanding this he kept
a very beautiful Mi&s;tri&s;s, and by her he had
a Daughter, whom he named <HI>Sabenia;</HI>
whereupon he grew &s;o enamoured of her,
that after the Death of his Father-in-law, the
Duke of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> he put a way his Lawful-Wife,
and Wedded his Mi&s;tri&s;s; his Wife was
&s;o extreamly netled at this, that &s;he imme|diately
repaired into <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and made
her Complaint there among&s;t her Friends

Power to revenge her Injury, &s;he fought
with her Husband <HI>Loarine,</HI> and Slew him,
and buried him at <HI>Trynobant,</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> af|terwards
executed her Revenge &s;till in the
highe&s;t Degree: She took the Lady, with
her fair Daughter <HI>Sabenia</HI> too, and drown|ed
them both in this River. The fir&s;t place
of Note we came to in this County was the

about the Year 179. The Pillars of this
Church are of an extraordinary thickne&s;s,
&s;carce to be parallel'd in any Church in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
but that which makes it more re|markable,
is a place at the Ea&s;t end of the

<P><HI>MOILENLLY-hill</HI> is the highe&s;t Hill in
this Shire, having a Spring of very clear Wa|ter
upon the top of it.</P>
<P><HI>WREXHAM</HI> in this County is about 16
Miles from <HI>Holy-well,</HI> and is much admired
for its Church-&s;teeple, being a very curious
Fabrick, contrived according to the mo&s;t ex|act
Draught and Models of Architecture,
no where to be parallel'd in tho&s;e parts for
Workman&s;hip, of which taking &s;ome &s;mall
view, we pa&s;&s;ed into <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> of which I
have already made mention.</P>
<P>I having already given a Relation of mo&s;t
of the Shires in <HI>Wales,</HI> and omitted <HI>Monmouth|&s;hire,</HI>
of which I could not in honour to the
County pa&s;s by without a Vi&s;it, &s;o &s;taying
at <HI>Hereford</HI> &s;ome days, we &s;et a-part &s;ome
time to go &s;ee <HI>Monmouth,</HI> of which it follows.</P>

<P>We found the Ways near <HI>Monmouth</HI> hard
and rugged, and that Town to be enviro|ned
with Hills on all Sides, the Ruins of its
Walls and Ca&s;tle argue its Antiquity. It
hath a fair Church and Market-place, with
<PB N="127" REF="80">
a Hall for the A&s;&s;izes and Se&s;&s;ions. 'Tis go|verned
by a Mayor, Recorder and Alder|men,
and the Inhabitants do generally &s;peak
both the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue: They
told us there, of great Immunities and Pri|vileges
granted to them by the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> but for no other thing is it &s;o
much renowned, as that it was fir&s;t the Na|tive
place, and gave Breath to <HI>Henry</HI> the
Fifth, that Scourge of the <HI>French,</HI> and glori|ous
Pillar of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, who Con|quered
<HI>Charles</HI> the Sixth King of <HI>France,</HI> and
all his Army, and made him &s;urrender up
his Crown unto him, and Acknowledge
him the triumphant Conqueror: Here we
were entertained with no other Objects but
what the &s;tony Rocks, the dangerous Clifts,
the towring Mountains, and craggy Preci|pices
did afford us, being now and then co|vered
with Flocks of Sheep, and Herds of
Goats; the Inhabitants told us, That upon
the <HI>Black Mountain</HI> there, as they call it, or
thereabouts, are &s;ome Hills &s;o high, who&s;e
Tops are &s;o &s;harp, that two Per&s;ons may
&s;tand upon two different Points thereof and
di&s;cour&s;e with one another, and under&s;tand
each other very well, although they mu&s;t
be forced to go &s;ome Miles before they can
embrace each other, but the truth of this I
will not averr; certain I am&punc; there are ma|ny
of them of &s;o unconceivable a height,
<PB N="128" REF="81">
and &s;o &s;teep an A&s;cent, that they &s;eem, as it
were, Nature's Stair-ca&s;es, by which we may
climb up to &s;ome higher Region, and have
Entercour&s;e with the Inhabitants of the
Moon.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a true and faithful Re|lation
of my Travels over <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI>
but cannot much commend the latter for
their Cookery, yet for their Linen it was in|different
&s;weet and clean: I could have men|tioned
&s;everal other things, but what has
been &s;poke of is mo&s;t material.</P>
