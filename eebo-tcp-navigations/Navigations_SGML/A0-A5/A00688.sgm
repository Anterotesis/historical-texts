<P>All tho&s;e quarters &s;warme with an incre|dible multitude of Inhabitants, wherof &s;ome are white, others blacke and in colour like vnto tho&s;e which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> or halfe-<HI>Moores,</HI> &amp; others of a mingled com|plexion. Some weare their haire long, black,
<PB N="5" REF="4">and &s;cattered, others haue their haire cri&s;ped and thicke, &amp; others very yellow and bright. Which diuer&s;itie is an apparant argument, that there is commerce and communication among&s;t them. And this con&s;ideration toge|ther with the bounty which Nature hath be|&s;towed on the &s;oile, their inexperience of Ar|tillerie and Guns, and their vnskilfulne&s;&s;e in labouring in Mines, with other &s;emblable circum&s;tances, doth induce mee to inferre, that all the Countrey is rich &amp; well-peopled. It &s;eemeth they know little what belongeth to artificiall trades; for they haue neither for|tifications nor walles, and liue without the awe of Kings or lawes. They are a &s;imple people cantoned into &s;euerall &s;exts, and facti|ons, &amp; exerci&s;e much di&s;agreement among&s;t them&s;elues. The Armes which they v&s;e are bowes and arrowes, which are not poi&s;oned or &s;teeped in the iuice of venemous hearbes, as the cu&s;tome is of many other Countreys; They do al&s;o carrie clubs, truncheons, pikes, darts to hurle with the arme, all which are framed only of wood. They doe couer them|&s;elues fro~ the wa&s;te or girdling-place downe
<PB N="6" REF="5">to the halfe of their thighes, they are very &s;tu|dious of cleanlines, tractable, gleeful, &amp; won|derou&s;ly addicted to be gratefull vnto tho&s;e that doe them a courte&s;ie, as I haue experien|ced many times. The which doth build in me a beliefe, that with the a&s;si&s;tance of God, if they may be gently and amiably intreated, they will bee found very docible and ea&s;ie of manage, and that wee &s;hall without much worke accommodate our &s;elues vnto them. And it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erue this way of &s;weetnes, e&s;pecially in the beginning, that the inhabitants may be drawne along to this &s;o holy and &s;auing an end, whereof we ought to take a particular care and zeale, a&s;well in &s;mall things, as in matters of more impor|tance. Their hou&s;es are built of wood, coue|red and tiled with Palme-tree leaues, they haue pitchers and ve&s;&s;els made of earth, they are not without the my&s;terie of weauing, and other curio&s;ities of that kind. They worke on Marble, they haue Flutes, Drummes, and wooden &s;poones, they &s;et apart certaine pla|ces for Oratories &amp; prayers, and for Church|yards. Their Gardens are artificially &s;euered
<PB N="7" REF="5">into beds, bordered and fa&s;hioned with di|&s;tinct limits; Mother of Pearle and the &s;hels which containe Pearle, they haue in much v&s;e and e&s;timation, of which they make wedges, ra&s;ors, &s;awes, culters, and &s;uch like in&s;truments; They al&s;o doe make thereof Pearles and great beads to weare about their neckes. They that doe dwell in the Ilands, haue boates very artificially made, and excee|dingly commodious for &s;ailing, which is a certaine argument that they confine vpon other Nations that are of a more poli&s;hed and elegant behauiour. And this al&s;o they haue of our husbandry, that they cut Cockes and gelde Boares.</P>
<P>Their bread is v&s;ually made of three &s;orts of rootes, which grow there in great abun|dance. Neither doe they imploy much la|bour in making this bread, for they doe one|ly ro&s;te the rootes vntill they are &s;oft and ten|der. They are very ple&s;ant to the ta&s;te, whol|&s;ome and nouri&s;hing, they are of a good length, there being of them of an Ell long, and the halfe of that in bigne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>There is great &s;tore of excellent fruits in
<PB N="8" REF="6">the&s;e Countreys. There are &s;ixe kindes of Maple trees, Almond trees of foure &s;orts, and other trees called Obi, re&s;embling almo&s;t in fruit and greatne&s;&s;e our Quince trees. Innu|merable Wallnut trees are found there, and of Citron trees the Barbarians haue no dearth, nor of other great and excellent fruits, which we haue &s;eene and ta&s;ted. They haue more|ouer Sugar-Canes, large in &s;ize and in great plenty, they haue knowlegde of our ordina|rie Apples; they haue Palme-trees without number, out of which there may ea&s;ily bee drawne a iuice, which will make a liquor al|luding much to wine, as al&s;o whey, vineger, and hony, the kernels thereof are exceeding &s;weet. And they haue fruits which the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> call <HI>Cocos,</HI> which being greene doe make a kind of twine, and the pith is almo&s;t like in ta&s;te vnto the creame of milke: When they are ripe they &s;erue for meat and drinke both by land and &s;ea. And when they wither and fall from the tree, there &s;weateth out an oyle from them, which is very good to burne in lampes, and is medicinable for wounds, and not vnplea&s;ant tobe eaten. Of their rindes
<PB N="9" REF="6">or barkes there are made bottles, and other like ve&s;&s;els, and the inner skin doth &s;erue for tow or mo&s;&s;e to &s;top and clo&s;e vp the leakes in &s;hippes. Men doe make Cables and other cordage of them, which are of &s;ufficient &s;trength to draw a Canon, and are fit for o|ther dome&s;ticke v&s;es. But that which is more &s;peciall, they do there v&s;e the leaues of Palme trees, which they ama&s;&s;e together, to make &s;ailes of them for ve&s;&s;els of &s;mall bulke and burthen. They make likewi&s;e fine thinne mattes of them, and they doe &s;erue for tiles to couer the hou&s;e without, and for hangings to cloath the hou&s;e within. And the&s;e hou|&s;es are built of the branches of trees that are &s;treight and long, of which they doe like|wi&s;e make pikes, and other &s;orts of weapons, as al&s;o oares to row with, and vten&s;ils for the hou&s;e. You are to note, that the&s;e Palme-trees re&s;emble Vines, from whence they gather their materials for Wine all the yeere long, which they make without much co&s;t, or la|bour. Among&s;t their herbage and garden fruits; Wee haue &s;eene Melons, Peares great and little, and &s;undry &s;orts of pot-hearbes.
<PB N="10" REF="7">And they haue al&s;o beanes. For fle&s;h, they are &s;tored with a great number of Hogges which are like vnto ours, they haue Hennes, Capons, Partriges, Duckes, Turtles, Pigeons, Stocke-doues, and Goats, as one of my Cap|taines doth relate. And the <HI>Indians</HI> them|&s;elues haue a&s;&s;ured vs that there are Cowes and Oxen. There are al&s;o &s;undry &s;orts of fi&s;h, Harghi, Per&s;ereyes, Lize, Soles, Troutes, Shads, Macabi&s;es, Ca&s;anes, Pampani, Pil|chards, Thorne-backs or Skate-fi&s;h, Cuculi, Congers, Porpo&s;es, Rochets, Muskles, Lob|&s;ters, and many other, the names whereof I cannot now remember. But it is probable that there are diuers other kinds, &s;ince tho&s;e which I haue recounted were taken hard by our &s;hips. And vpon ripe and &s;erious con&s;i|deration of that which I haue repre&s;ented vnto you, a man may ea&s;ily collect, that &s;uch plentifull and different varieties of all things, may yeeld large meanes to inhabite there, with great and &s;ingular delights. There is &s;tuffe for Marchpanes and &s;weet confections of all &s;orts, without borrowing any &s;pice for the compo&s;ition of them el&s;where. And for
<PB N="11" REF="7">my Mates the Marriners, be&s;ides tho&s;e parti|culars which I haue before &s;et downe, there will be no want of Gammons, Sau&s;ages, and other &s;alt meats which hogges doe yeeld; nei|ther of vineger, &s;piceries, and other &s;auces that &s;erue for delicacy, and to awake the ap|petite. And you mu&s;t ob&s;erue, that many of the&s;e things, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e which wee haue in our parts, and po&s;&s;ibly they are there in greater abundance; by all which it is ea&s;ily to be coniectured, that this Coun|trey is fit for the production of all that which groweth in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The riches which I haue &s;eene in tho&s;e parts, is Siluer and Pearle; another Captaine in his Relation, doth report that he hath &s;een Gold, which are the three mo&s;t precious dar|lings that lie and are cheri&s;hed in the bo&s;ome of Nature. Wee haue al&s;o both of vs &s;eene many Nutmegs, much Ma&s;ticke, Ginger, and Pepper. There is al&s;o Cinnamum; and it is likely that Cloues may bee found in tho&s;e parts, &s;ince &s;o many other &s;orts of Spiceries and aromaticall drugges doe pro&s;per there; and that the rather, becau&s;e the&s;e Countryes
<PB N="12" REF="8">lie very neere the parallell of the Iles of <HI>Terr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|natte, Bachian,</HI> and the <HI>Moluccos.</HI> There an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> likewi&s;e materials for all &s;orts of &s;ilke, and we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> haue &s;eene Ani&s;e-&s;eed, and excellent good Ebony, as al&s;o other kinds of wood proper for the building of as many &s;hippes as one will de&s;ire, and &s;tuffe to make &s;ailesf or the &s;ame. Three &s;orts of materials there are wherewithall to make cordage, and one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> them is very like vnto our hempe. More o|uer out of the oyle of <HI>Cocos,</HI> whereof I haue already made mention, there is a kind of bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tuminous &s;tuffe extracted, called <HI>Galagald</HI> which may bee well v&s;ed for pitch. They make al&s;o a kinde of ro&s;en with which the <HI>Indians</HI> pitch their boats, which they call <HI>Pi|raques.</HI> And &s;ince there are Goates and Cowes in tho&s;e parts, without que&s;tion we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hall haue Goat-skins, leather, tallow, and fle&s;h in full abundance. The Bees which we haue &s;eene there doe make proofe, that there will be no &s;carcety of hony and waxe. And there is good appearance to di&s;couer many other things which are not yet known, to &s;ay nothing touching thefor me and &s;ite of the
<PB N="13" REF="8">Countrey. Vnto all which if that be adioy|ned, which the indu&s;try of man may contri|bute to tho&s;e parts, &s;ince there is &s;uch aboun|dance of commodities which the Countrey it &s;elfe doth yeeld, and &s;uch hope to tran&s;port thither tho&s;e things which grow with vs, the be&s;t and choi&s;e&s;t whereof that <HI>Peru</HI> and new <HI>Spaine</HI> bring foorth, I haue re&s;olued to tran&s;|ferre thither; it is to be hoped, that this will &s;o enrich that Countrey, that it will be able to nouri&s;h and furni&s;h not only the Inhabi|tants of the &s;ame, and tho&s;e of <HI>America,</HI> but giue an acce&s;&s;ion vnto <HI>Spaine</HI> it &s;elfe both of riches and extent of Command: and this may be accompli&s;hed after the maner which I haue proiected, and will vnfold vnto tho&s;e which &s;hall lend an a&s;si&s;ting hand for the guiding and con&s;ummation of this worke.</P>
<P>Now by that land which we haue already di&s;couered outwardly and along the &s;hores, without entrance into the inward parts, we doe conceiue a certaine argument, that as much riches, commodities, and greatne&s;&s;e, may be hoped for from thence, as we haue already in the&s;e Countreyes. And you may
<PB N="14" REF="9">be plea&s;ed to vnder&s;tand, that my principall ayme was to take a view only of the&s;e ample regions which wee haue di&s;couered: for by rea&s;on of many &s;ickene&s;&s;es which haue wea|kened me, and &s;ome other chances whereof I will at this time make no mention, I was not able to &s;uruay all which I de&s;ired, neither could I in a full moneth haue &s;eene all that, which I was of my &s;elfe inclinable to view.</P>
<P>You are not to make your iudgement of the <HI>Indians</HI> that inhabit the&s;e Countreys, ac|cording to the honour of the people here, or conceiue them to be affected with the &s;ame de&s;ires, plea&s;ures, nece&s;sities, or e&s;timation of things that we are: But you are to make ac|count that they are a people who&s;e care is &s;tu|diou&s;ly placed vpon this, that they may liue ea&s;ily in this world, and pa&s;&s;e their dayes with the lea&s;t paine and perturbation they can. And this is indeed their practi&s;e, for they doe not be&s;tow them&s;elues on tho&s;e things, which with &s;uch vexation and tor|ment we here labour to obtaine.</P>
<P>There are found in this Countrey as many comodities, both for the &s;upport &amp; delecta|tion
<PB N="15" REF="9">of the life of man, as may be expected from a &s;oile that is manureable, plea&s;ant and very temperate. It is a fat and a fertile land, wherein many places Clay is found, which will prooue of excellent v&s;e to build hou&s;es, and to make tiles and brickes, and will &s;erue for What&s;oeuer is v&s;ually made of earth. There is no dearth of Marble and other good &s;tones, wherewith if there be occa&s;ion there may be built &s;tructures of greater State and Magnificence.</P>
<P>The Countrey aboundeth in wood, fit for all workes and v&s;es, whereunto the &s;ame is commonly put. There are &s;patious &amp; good|ly plaines, and fields that are diuided and in|terlaced with brookes, trenches, and riuers. There are great and high rockes, &s;undry tor|rents, riuers great and little, on which water|milles for corne may with much commodi|ou&s;ne&s;&s;e be built and placed, as al&s;o Engins to make Sugar, Tucking-milles, Forges, and all other in&s;truments which in their v&s;e doe require water.</P>
<P>We haue found Salt-pits there, and which is a note of the fertilitie of the &s;oile, there are
<PB N="16" REF="10">in many places Canes whereof &s;ome are fiue or &s;ixe handfuls thicke, with fruit an&s;wera|ble to that proportion. The top of that fruit is very &s;mall and hard, and the skin thereof is exceeding &s;weet. There are al&s;o Flints for fire, equall in goodne&s;&s;e with tho&s;e of <HI>Ma|drid.</HI> The bay of Saint <HI>Iames</HI> and Saint <HI>Phi|lip</HI> hath twenty leagues of banke, and is with|out mudde; Into which there is a &s;ure and &s;afe entrance both by day and night. It is &s;heltered and couered with many hou&s;es, which in the day time we haue &s;eene a farre off to &s;end foorth &s;moake, and in the night to &s;hew foorth fire.</P>
<P>The Hauen called <HI>The true Cro&s;&s;e</HI> is of that &s;pacious capacitie, that it is able to containe a thou&s;and Shippes. The botome as I haue &s;aid is without mudde, and hath a blacki&s;h coloured &s;and wherewithall it is couered. There are no gulfes or deepe pits, but an a&s;|&s;ured and ea&s;ie anchorage in what part &s;oe|uer you will, from forty to halfe a fadome; and it is betweene the mouthes of two ri|uers, the one whereof is as great as that of <HI>Quadalguiuer,</HI> &amp; hath mud of a fadom deepe,
<PB N="17" REF="10">ouer which our Shaloppes and boates did pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>For the other riuer, when our Skiffs went to water there, they found the entrance &s;afe and ea&s;ie. And a man may from the very mouth of the riuer take in as much fre&s;h wa|ter as he will. The place where &s;hips may be vnloaded hath three leagues of grauell, min|gled with little flints blacki&s;h and very hea|uie, which will &s;erue for bala&s;te for &s;hippes. The banke is &s;traight and vnited, on which much greene gra&s;&s;e doth grow and pro&s;per, and that makes me to conceiue that the Sea doth not beat or rage thereupon; I ob&s;erue that the trees are &s;treight, and the branches not di&s;membred, which is a token that there are no tempe&s;ts there. Touching the Port, be&s;ides the commodities which I haue al|ready di&s;cour&s;ed of, there is one of maruel|lous plea&s;ure and contentation. And that is, that at the dawning of the day you &s;hal heare from a wood which is neere at hand, a &s;weet and various harmony of a thou&s;and birdes of all &s;orts, among which we could di&s;tingui&s;h the Nightingales, Black-birds, Quailes, Gold|finches,
<PB N="18" REF="11">Swallowes almo&s;t without num|ber, Parrochitos, and one Parret we marked there, and creatures of &s;undrie other kinds, euen downe to Gra&s;&s;e-hoppers, and Field|crickets.</P>
<P>Euerie Morning and Euening wee recei|ued a mo&s;t odoriferous &s;weet &s;mell, &s;ent vn|to our no&s;trells from the infinite diuer&s;itie of Flowers and Hearbes which grow there, among&s;t which we ob&s;erued the blo&s;&s;omes of Oranges and Ba&s;il. All which (with a number of other varieties) doth make vs thinke that the ayre is cleare and healthie, and that the nature of the place is of a good tem|perature. The Hauen &amp; the Bay are therfore of the greater e&s;timation, becau&s;e they haue the neighbourhood of &s;o many goodly I|lands that are there, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e &s;euen, which are &s;aid to haue two hundreth leagues of extent: and &s;urely one of them (which is &s;ome twelue leagues di&s;tant from the Hauen) is fiftie leagues in circuit. In briefe SIR, I doe affirme vnto your Maie|&s;tie, that you may giue commaund to haue a goodly and great Citie built in this Port and
<PB N="19" REF="11">Bay, which are in fifteene degrees and fortie minutes of the Southerne Eleuation, and tho&s;e that &s;hall inhabite there, &s;hall haue plentie of riches, and all other conueniencies which they can de&s;ire. Time will &s;hew and di&s;couer all the&s;e commodities, and in this place there may be made the di&s;charge and vnloading of all the wares and merchandi|zes of the Countries of <HI>Chilly, Peru, Panania, Macaraqua, Guttimala, New-Spaine, Terre-natte,</HI> and the <HI>Philippines,</HI> all which Countries are vnder the commaund of your Maie&s;tie. And if you &s;hall acquire vnto your &s;elfe the Do|minion of the&s;e Seigniories which I do now pre&s;ent, I doe make &s;o great an e&s;teeme of them, that be&s;ides their being the Key of all the re&s;t, they will (in my opinion) prooue a|nother <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Iapan,</HI> and equallize the o|ther rich Ilands which are on this &s;ide of <HI>A|&s;ia,</HI> in trafique of curious and pretious mer|chandizes, to &s;peake nothing of the augmen|tation and extent of your power, and the e|&s;tabli&s;hment which you may make vnto your &s;elfe of your Dominions, by the acce&s;|&s;ion of &s;o great a Countrie. That which I
<PB N="20" REF="12">haue giuen vnto your viewe in my di&s;|cour&s;e, is of much &s;lenderne&s;&s;e, in regard of that which I doe probably conceiue of this land, the which I am readie to make appeare in the pre&s;ence of Mathematicians. Neither will I vexe this paper to demon&s;trate vnto you, that the&s;e Countries will be able at the fir&s;t aboord to nouri&s;h twentie thou&s;and Spaniards. In &s;umme, this is SIR, the world whereof Spaine is the Center, and that which I haue related, is the nayle by which you may iudge of the whole bodie, which I pray you to take into your ob&s;eruation.</P>
<P>You may iudge by that which I haue alrea|die repre&s;ented, what the goodne&s;&s;e and tem|perature of the ayre is: whereunto this may be added for a further te&s;timonie, that al|though all our Companie were &s;trangers, yet neuer a one of them was &s;icke, albeit they were in continuall trauell and labour, and did &s;ometimes &s;weat, and &s;ometimes take wet. They dranke water fa&s;ting, and fed manie times on that which the earth did there bring forth. Neither had they any regard to keepe them&s;elues from the Serenes, nor from
<PB N="21" REF="12">the Moone or Sunne, which indeed in tho&s;e parts is not ouer-vehement. Onely about Mid-night, they couered them&s;elues with Wooll, and did lye and repo&s;e them&s;elues thereupon. And for the Inhabitants, they are commonly healthie, and many of them verie aged, although they haue nothing but the bare earth for their pallet: which is an argument of the whole&s;omene&s;&s;e and pure|ne&s;&s;e of the &s;oyle. For if it were a wet and weeping ground, or had any viciou&s;ne&s;&s;e in the mould, they would rai&s;e their lodgings higher from the earth, as they doe that liue in the <HI>Philippines,</HI> and other Countries which I haue viewed. And this is further confirmed by their Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h, which although it bee vn&s;alted, yet will it keepe &s;weete, and without corruption two daies. And the fruits which are brought from thence are ex|ceeding good, as wee had proofe by two that I tooke care to bring along with mee, al|though they had not their full maturitie and grouth when I gathered them from the Tree. Wee haue not &s;eene any barren and &s;andie ground, nor any Thi&s;tles, or trees that
<PB N="22" REF="13">are thornie or who&s;e rootes doe &s;hew them|&s;elues, no Mari&s;hes or Fennes, no Snow vp|on the Mountaines, no Snakes or Serpents, no Crocodiles in the Riuers, no Wormes that v&s;e with vs to hurt and con&s;ume our Grayne, and to worke vs &s;o much di&s;plea&s;ure in our hou&s;es, no Fleas, Cater-pillers, or Gnats. This is a Prerogatiue that hath the aduauntage of all the priuiledges that nature hath be&s;towed on other places, and is worthie to be compa|red, or rather preferred before any delicacie of the Countries of India, &s;ome of which are abandoned and vnhabited, meerely by rea|&s;on of the&s;e incommodities, and of &s;undrie others that are di&s;ta&s;tfull vnto the Inhabi|tants, as my &s;elfe haue oftentimes beene wit|ne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e (SIR) are the vertues and excel|lencies of the Countries which I haue di&s;co|uered, of which I haue already taken the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion in the name of your Maie&s;tie, and vn|der your Royall-Banner, as appeareth by the Acts which I keepe &s;afely in my power, whereunto I proceeded after this en&s;uing manner.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="13">Fir&s;t (SIR) wee erected a Cro&s;&s;e, and built a Church in honour of our Ladie of <HI>Loretto.</HI> Then wee cau&s;ed twentie Ma&s;&s;es to be celebrated there, and our troupes made ha&s;t thither to gaine &s;ome Indulgences. We al&s;o made a &s;olemne Proce&s;&s;ion, and ob&s;er|ued the Fea&s;t of the ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament, the which was carried in Proce&s;&s;ion, your Ban|ner being euer di&s;played, and marching be|fore it, through a great Circuit of Coun|tries, which were honoured with the pre|&s;ence of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In three &s;euerall places wee &s;et vp your Titles, in euerie one of which wee prepared and erected two Columnes, with the Armes of your Maie&s;tie tricked and garni&s;hed there|upon: &s;o that I may with good right affirme, that &s;ince this will challenge to be one of the Parts of the World, the Impre&s;&s;e of <HI>Plus vl|tra</HI> is accompli&s;hed, and becau&s;e it &s;tretcheth vnto the continent, whether it be forward or behind it skills not, the bounds of your Dominions are with much &s;paciou&s;ne&s;&s;e en|larged. Now all this which I haue perfor|med, receiueth its root from this the faithfull
<PB N="24" REF="14">zeale which I beare vnto your Maie&s;tie, that to all the Titles which you alreadie doe po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;e, you may adjoyne this which I repre|&s;ent, and that the name of TERRA AV|STRALIS INCOGNITA may be bla|zoned and &s;pread ouer the face of the whole world to the glorie of God, who hath reuea|led this Countrie, and hath giuen mee the grace to guide my cour&s;e thither, and to re|turne to the pre&s;ence of your Maie&s;tie, be|fore whom I do pre&s;ent &amp; pro&s;trate my &s;elfe with the &s;ame affection and zeale vnto this worke which I had before, and which hath growne vp with mee as it were from my cradle, and for the noblene&s;&s;e and worth thereof, I doe &s;till tender and cheri&s;h the &s;ame with the greate&s;t loue that can be.</P>
<P>I doe confidently beleeue, that your Ma|ie&s;tie doth v&s;e &s;o much prudence in your Councels, and are &s;o magnanimous and full of Chri&s;tian pietie, that you will (with your be&s;t care) embrace all the conducements which may further the habitation of the&s;e new-di&s;couered Countries. And the princi|pall rea&s;on to put a tye and obligation vpon
<PB N="25" REF="14">vs not to leaue them abandoned, is, in regard that this is the &s;ole ordinarie way to e&s;tabli&s;h the knowledge of God, and faith among&s;t them, and to bring to pa&s;&s;e that his name may be adored and called vpon, where the Deuill v&s;urpeth &s;o much reuerence and in|uocation. And this ought to bee embraced with the more readine&s;&s;e, becau&s;e it is the channell to conuay and di&s;per&s;e all aboun|dance of commodities among&s;t your &s;ub|iects. And hereby you &s;hall be ea&s;ed of ma|ny di&s;turbances and vexations, which will a&s;&s;uredly be put vpon you, in ca&s;e the Here|tickes &s;hould enter &amp; ne&s;tle there, and &s;hould vent their erronious doctrines among&s;t them, whereby they would conuert all the ble&s;&s;ings which I haue hitherto recounted vnto you, into a&s;&s;ured incommodities and mi&s;chiefes, and would arrogate vnto them|&s;elues the name of the Lords of the <HI>Indias,</HI> to the vtter ruine and de&s;olation of tho&s;e coun|tries. I make no que&s;tion but your Maie&s;ty well weigheth of what importance this dan|ger of which I &s;peak may proue, &amp; what euil con&s;equence &s;ome other hazards may carrie
<PB N="26" REF="15">with them, which are either at this time im|minent, or may &s;ucceed hereafter. And if this &s;hould happen, it would co&s;t you innume|rable thou&s;ands of gold and men, before you &s;hall be able to giue a remedie vnto the &s;ame. Acquire therefore SIR, whiles that occa&s;ion is offered you (that one day you may pur|cha&s;e heauen vnto your &s;elfe;) acquire (I &s;ay) with a little mony which you mi&s;-place vp|on <HI>Peru,</HI> a neuer-dying reputation, and this <HI>New-world</HI> with all the benefits which it rea|cheth out vnto you. And &s;ince there is none that craueth a reward for this good tidings that is brought you concerning &s;o great and &s;ingular a ble&s;&s;ing, which God hath bin plea|&s;ed to lock vp vntil your happie time, I am he SIR, that doe demaund it, and my humble reque&s;t vnto you is only this, that you would be of that gratiou&s;ne&s;&s;e vnto mee, as to di&s;|patch and giue me mine an&s;wer: for the Gal|lions are readie to hoy&s;e &s;ayle, and I haue much way to goe, and many things mu&s;t be fitted and di&s;po&s;ed for the voyage.

<P>Let it therefore plea&s;e your Maie&s;tie, a|mong&s;t &s;o many expedients which you haue at hand, to &s;euer and put apart &s;ome one for the accompli&s;hment of this worke, that after all the&s;e langui&s;hments, I may at length meet with the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of my de&s;ires.
