Such <HI>Helps in Government</HI> had he him|&s;elf been ble&s;&s;ed withal; the la&s;t of which was the well-de&s;erving Elder <HI>Bowles;</HI> and of <HI>him,</HI> did this good man, in a Speech to a <HI>Synod</HI> of all the Churches in this Colony, take occa&s;ion to

<P>But the mention of a <HI>Synod</HI> brings to mind a|nother thing, which he was Concerned, that we might never want; and that is, a frequent Re|petition of <HI>Needful Synods</HI> in our Churches. For tho' he had a deep and a due care to pre&s;erve the <HI>Rights of particular Churches,</HI> yet he thought all the Churches of the Lord Je&s;us by their <HI>&V;nion</HI> in what they <HI>profe&s;s,</HI> in what they <HI>in|tend,</HI> and in what they <HI>enioy,</HI> &s;o compacted into one <HI>Body My&s;tical,</HI> as that all the &s;everal <HI>par|ticular Churches</HI> every where &s;hould <HI>act</HI> with a regard unto the good of the whole, and unto the common <HI>Advice</HI> and <HI>Coun&s;il</HI> of the Neighbourhood; which cannot be done al|ways by <HI>Letters mi&s;&s;ive,</HI> like tho&s;e that pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> in the early dayes of Chri&s;tianity; but it requires a Convention of the Churches in <HI>Synods,</HI> by their <HI>Delegates</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;engers.</HI> He did not count Churches to be &s;o <HI>Independent,</HI> as that they can always di&s;charge their whole Duty, and yet not act in a conjunc|tion with Neighbour-Churches; nor would he be of any Church that will not acknowledge it &s;elf <HI>accountable</HI> to rightly compo&s;ed <HI>Synods,</HI> which may have occa&s;ion to enquire into the

<P>He therefore Printed an ingenious little Book wearing this Title, <HI>The Divine Management of

<P>It is above forty Years &s;ince that truly godly Man, Mr. <HI>John Elliot,</HI> Pa&s;tour of the Church at <HI>Rocksborough,</HI> (about a mile from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI>) being warmed with a holy Zeal of Converting the <HI>Americans,</HI> &s;et him&s;elf to

<P>Twas in the year 1646. that Mr. <HI>Eliot</HI> ac|company'd by three more, gave a vi&s;it unto an A&s;&s;embly of <HI>Indians,</HI> of whom he de|&s;ired a Meeting at &s;uch a time and place, that he might lay before them the things of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters"> Eternal Peace. After a &s;erious <HI>Prayer,</HI> he gave them a <HI>Sermon</HI> which continued about a quar|ter above an hour, and contained the principal Articles of the Chri&s;tian Religion, applying all to the condition of the <HI>Indians</HI> pre&s;ent Having done, he asked of them, whether <HI>they under&s;tood?</HI> and with a general reply they an|&s;wered, <HI>They under&s;tood all.</HI> He then began what was his u&s;ual method afterwards in treat|ing with them; that is, he cau&s;ed them to pro|pound &s;uch <HI>que&s;tions</HI> as they pleas'd, unto him|&s;elf; and he gave wi&s;e and good <HI>an&s;wers</HI> to them all. Their <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> would often, tho'
<PB N="96" REF="53"> not always, refer to what he had newly Preach|ed; and he this way not only made a <HI>Proof</HI> of their profiting by his Mini&s;try, but al&s;o gave an <HI>Edge</HI> to what he delivered unto them. Some of their <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> would be a little <HI>Philo&s;ophical,</HI> and required a good mea&s;ure of Learning in the Mini&s;ter concerned with them; but for this our <HI>Eliot</HI> wanted not. He would al&s;o put pro|per <HI>Que&s;tions</HI> unto them, and at one of his fir&s;t Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rci&s;es with them, he made the young ones ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">able of regarding tho&s;e three Que&s;tions,</P>

<P>Q. 2. <HI>Who do you look &s;hould &s;ave you from Sin and Hell?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 3. <HI>How many Commandments has the Lord given you to keep?</HI></P>
<P>It was his wi&s;dom that he began with them upon &s;uch principles, as they them&s;elves had already &s;ome Notions of; &s;uch as that of an <HI>Heaven</HI> for good, and <HI>Hell</HI> for bad people, when they <HI>Dy'd.</HI> It broke his gracious heart within him to &s;ee, what Floods of Tears fell from the Eyes of &s;everal among the&s;e Degenerate Salva|ges, at the fir&s;t Addre&s;&s;es which he made unto them; yea, from the very wor&s;t of them all. He was very inqui&s;itive to learn who were the <HI>Powawes,</HI> that is, the <HI>Sorcerers</HI> and <HI>Seducers,</HI> that maintained the Wor&s;hip of the Devil in any of their Societies; and having in one of his fir&s;t Journeys to them, found out one of tho&s;e Wretches, he made the Indian come unto

<P>The Text which he fir&s;t Preach'd upon, was that in Ezek. 37.9, 10. <HI>That by Prophe&s;ying to the Wind, the Wind came and the dry bones lived;</HI> and it was an ob&s;ervation made by one, who then ju&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed, there was <HI>not much weight</HI> in it; That the word which the Indians u&s;e for <HI>Wind</HI> is <HI>Wauban,</HI> and an Indian of that Name was one of the fir&s;t that here zealou&s;ly promoted the Conver&s;ion of his Neighbours. But having thus entred upon the <HI>Teaching</HI> of the&s;e poor Creatures, t'is incredible how much time, toyl, and hard&s;hip, he underwent in the Pro&s;ecution of this Undertaking; how many weary dayes and nights rolled over him; how many tire&s;ome Journeys he endured; and how many terrible dangers, he had experince of. If you briefly would know <HI>what</HI> he felt, and <HI>what</HI> carried him through all, take it in his own words, in a Letter to the Honourable Mr. <HI>Win&s;low;</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I have not been dry night nor day, from the third day of the week unto the &s;ixth, but &s;o Tra|velled, and at night pull off my Boots, wring my blockings, and on with them again, and &s;o continue,
