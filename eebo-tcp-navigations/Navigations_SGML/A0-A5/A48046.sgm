<HEAD>A LETTER FROM AN OFFICER Belonging to the ORDNANCE On BOARD the FLEET Lying in the BAY before the ISLE of <HI>MAN,</HI> Giving an ACCOUNT of the Duke of <HI>Schom|berg</HI>'s Arrival and Landing of the FORCES under his Command at <HI>Carrick Fergus</HI> IN IRELAND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>From the ISLE of</HI> MAN Augu&s;t 15th.</P>
<P>YE&s;terday &s;even Night, we arrived at the Camp that was formed near <HI>Highlake</HI> in Order to be Tran&s;ported for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and la&s;t <HI>Saturday</HI> we &s;hipt our Stores and Pro|vi&s;ions that we brought with us, as al&s;o two hundred and fifty draught Hor&s;es, belonging to our Train of Artillery; after which we went on Board our &s;elves. On <HI>Monday</HI> mor|ning very early the Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> our General, with Lieu|tenant General <HI>Solmes,</HI> &s;et Sail, having embarqued two days before, the Wind being fair at Ea&s;t, with four Frigats, and
<PB REF="2">about &s;eventy or eighty Sail of other Ships, on board which there were about twelve hundred Land Souldiers for the Iri&s;h Expedition; having given Orders that the Ve&s;&s;els on which the Artillery, Provi&s;ions and Victuals were &s;hipp'd, &s;hould make what ha&s;te they could after them under the Convoy of three Frigates, that were left to accompany us, and joyn him in this Bay; about eight of the Clock that morning, which was &s;ome hours after the General had been under &s;ail, we &s;et &s;ail, and the Wind continuing fair, we came on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> mor|ning to an Anchor in this place, being about forty and four &s;ail in all; it was no &s;mall &s;urpri&s;e to us, that after we had &s;afely, and with what ha&s;te we could come to the place of Rende|vouz to find no tidings of our General, nor meet with any Orders from him, there being no body left to direct us what we &s;hould do, or what Cour&s;e we &s;hould &s;teer; however we were re&s;olved to &s;tay until we heard from his Grace, which we had the good luck to do this Morning by the <HI>Antelope</HI> Frigat, who &s;ail'd out of <HI>Highlake</HI> with the General, and brought us Orders from his Excellency to &s;ail with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed from hence, and to come and joyn him in the <HI>Lough</HI> of <HI>Car|rick Fergus,</HI> where the Captain &s;aid he had left him, landing the Forces in the Country on <HI>Antrim-&s;ide.</HI></P>
<P>The Captain tells us, that the General having fair wind did not think it needful to put in and come to Anchor in this Place being re&s;olv'd to make the be&s;t of it, and proceed on his way, and farther tells us that the Town of <HI>Carrick Fergus</HI> was not all burnt down, but only &s;ome Fort, or Ca&s;tle that was on a Rock that was blown up. Thus Major General <HI>Macarty</HI> was certainly wounded and taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Inneskilling</HI> Men who had given a very great defeat to the Iri&s;h Army, as they were endeavouring to retire from the North, after the Relief of <HI>London Derry,</HI> and that it was credibly reported in tho&s;e Parts, that there was hardly a Body of five hundred Iri&s;h together in all the North Counties of that Kingdom.</P>
