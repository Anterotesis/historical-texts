<HEAD>A true relation of the victory by &s;ea, obtained by the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e against the Rochellers, the</HI> 27 <HI>of</HI> October, 1622.</HEAD>
<P>_GOD hath euermore, and e|uen vntill this pre&s;ent, by his &s;peciall fauour &s;o a&s;si&s;ted the Kings affaires, that no man need doubt but that the eye of his diuine Prouidence hath alwaies been open for the protection and &s;afegard of this Monarchie, again&s;t the bould and treache|rous attempts of tho&s;e which haue gone a|bout to contriue the &s;ubuer&s;ion thereof. And as his faithfull &s;eruants, which are neer about his per&s;on, &s;triue who may be&s;t &s;erue him: euen &s;o &s;uch as are mo&s;t remote, are
<PB N="6" REF="3">no le&s;&s;e zealous and affectionate to employ them&s;elues worthily for the good of their Countrey. The Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> among&s;t o|thers (a true Imitator of the genero&s;ity of his Ance&s;tors; who, vnder the fortune of our Kings, haue holpen to augment their Tri|umphs) was &s;o impatient to &s;ee the vn&s;ea|&s;onablene&s;&s;e of the weather and contrarie winds to hinder him from doing &s;ome no|table exploit, that in the end he took the ve|ry fir&s;t occa&s;ion and oportunity, as follows.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t then knowe, that the 24 of Oc|tober his Maie&s;ties Nauy arriued within &s;ight of land, where they were con&s;trained to come to an anchor at the entry of <HI>Hole Bretton,</HI> neer to <HI>Balenes;</HI> whither Mon&s;ieur the Earl of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI> came with 1500 foot and 200 Gentlemen, all of them ap|pointed to land after the Fight.</P>
<P>The Gallies al&s;o &s;et fail, and came to the <HI>rendevous,</HI> remaining all day in view of the enemies Armie; whil'&s;t the Earl of <HI>Ioygnie,</HI> Generall of the Gallies, went to the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> to receiue &s;uch order from him as he &s;hould plea&s;e to giue the re&s;t of this day was imployed by the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> about
<PB N="7" REF="3">ordering of the fight; &s;o as the fleet, beeing not able to make any way but with the tide, by rea&s;on of the great calm, all it could do was onely to come to an anchor at that place whither the Gallies were aduanced, about two houres after midnight. Where|upon it was re&s;olued to a&s;&s;emble all the Captains 2 or 3 houres before day, which was done the 26. And after, hauing diui|ded the Fleet into three &s;quadrons, namely, the Admirals, Viceadmirals and Rereadmi|rals, and giuen order to the captains to com vp in files, that they might haue their broad &s;ides free to play with their great ordina~ce, without any danger to them&s;elues, the Ge|nerall of the Gallies was appointed to giue the on&s;et vpon the enemie, who lay at an|chor in &s;ight of them in the open rode be|fore the Ile of <HI>Re</HI> belowe S. <HI>Martins;</HI> who &s;eeing the Gallies approach, and the Kings fleet in &s;ight, &s;et &s;ail, the winde little &s;eruing the Kings Nauy, and the tide almo&s;t &s;pent; &s;o as all they could do, was to come within a league of their enemies: who &s;eeing the Gallies, began to &s;hoot; and the Gallies at them again. Then the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> re&s;ol|ued
<PB N="8" REF="4">to go him&s;elf to take a view of the ene|my, and to this end &s;ent to the Generall for a Gallie: and in the mean time hee and the Earl of <HI>Rochefoucault</HI> put them&s;elues with 5 or &s;ix other Gentlemen into a barge; and meeting with the Gallie, hee went aboard her, and by and by met with the Generall whom he had orderd before not to engage him&s;elf too far, but to &s;tay for him. After this, he went aboard the Admirall, and re|&s;olued to approach the enemy, to di&s;couer the burden of their &s;hips, and the bore of their Ordinance; which he &s;o happily per|formed, that thereupon the fight began, and by little and little &s;o increa&s;ed, that hee con|&s;trained them being but newly anchored, to &s;et &s;aile againe: and approaching them with his musket &s;hot, putting his Gallies in front, and &s;euering them an hundred or &s;ix|&s;core pa&s;es a&s;under, all the Cannons in their prowes were di&s;charged, which cau&s;ed many pieces of wood to &s;wimme towards them, which their artillery had torne from their &s;ides; &s;o as he iudged it then a fit time to giue them battel, and co~manded Mon&s;. <HI>de S. Luc.</HI> Viceadmiral, to bring forward the
<PB N="9" REF="4">fleet, and to pack on all &s;ailes, which was done with all diligence; &s;o as the Captains, &s;triuing who &s;hould get one before another to &s;et vpon the enemie, brake their order when they were but within half a league of them. In the mean time, the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> put him&s;elf aboard the Admirall, and &s;taied the forwarde&s;t of them, being within &s;hot of the enemy, and already at blowes. The Rochellers fleeting clo&s;e aboard the Ilands, and by little &amp; little (all men iudging them to flie) got &s;o much into the winde, as there was now no &s;triuing for it. They diuided their Nauy into 3 bodies, as the Kings fleet was; and approaching &s;oftly vnto it, &s;hewd they had a good will to fight. The Cannons began then to play within reach one of a|nother, about 3 a clock after noon: and within a while after, the hindermo&s;t of ours making ha&s;te, were within musket &s;hot of them.</P>
<P>The enemie &s;eeing that our great &amp; hea|uie ve&s;&s;els plied not to windeward &s;o well as our little ones, they re&s;olued to a&s;&s;ail our Vantguard; which they &s;o wel performed, that by &amp; by they were at it pel mel, where
<PB N="10" REF="5">Mon&s;. <HI>de S. Luc.</HI> who commanded the &s;ame Vant-gard, and was the fir&s;t &s;et vpon, beha|ued him&s;elf very nobly, &s;u&s;taining him&s;elf alone for a &s;mall while the brunt of the ene|my.</P>
<P>The Gallion of <HI>Malta,</HI> to which the Ge|nerall had &s;ent two Gallies to hale her a|long, approached; and the other which were to leward, got into the wind to &s;hoot at the enemie in the flank.</P>
<P>The Admirall by often boarding endea|uored by all po&s;sible means to get to wind|ward. In the end, &s;eeing all the fleet &s;et on the Vantgard, and to put her in great dan|ger, in &s;tead of tacking once more about, turned &s;hort vpon the enemie, and alone oppo&s;ed him&s;elf again&s;t them all. In this &s;o dangerous an exigent, all the officers and pilots of the &s;hippe were on their knees be|fore the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> to &s;hew him into what perill he did thru&s;t him&s;elf, not being any waies able to bee a&s;si&s;ted by any of his other &s;hips, which were all to lewards of him: but hee generou&s;ly &s;urmounting all things which might alter his purpo&s;e, re|&s;olued to go on and approach the enemie,
<PB N="11" REF="5">and &s;aue his Vantagard which el&s;e would be lo&s;t: which cau&s;ed them all to turn toward him, and to a&s;&s;ail him in very good order, conducting before them vnder fauour of their cannon and musket &s;hot, 2 &s;hips full of fire-works chained together: and after their fir&s;t charge crying, Aboard, aboard, they tied with their grapples the two fire &s;hips to the wa&s;te of our Admirall, which &s;uddenly took fire both within &amp; on their &s;ailes; &s;o as the flame got vp as high as the Ma&s;t head. This was a &s;tratagem which the Rochellers had made great boa&s;t of before their &s;etting out to &s;ea, as if it had been as ea&s;ie a matter to burn our Admirall, as to make it their proiect.</P>
<P>In the mean time their musket&s;hot and artillery plaied vnce&s;&s;antly; and then was <HI>le Sieur de Vinceguerre</HI> &s;lain with a musket &s;hot, being vpon the Nettings, neer vnto Mon&s;. <HI>de Gui&s;e,</HI> who had commanded him to attend the quenching of the fire, as him|&s;elf to prouide for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>This combate la&s;ted two houres during the day light; and night drawing on, it continued yet an houre more, and it was
<PB N="12" REF="6">&s;o ob&s;tinately maintained, that many of the Rochelers were &s;lain at the pu&s;h of the pike</P>
<P>Mon&s;. <HI>de Tauanes</HI> commanded in the fore|ca&s;tle: The Count <HI>de Cur&s;e,</HI> in the poop; and Mon&s;. <HI>de Queruenaux,</HI> the Voluntaries, who were diuided between them.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> his guard, and &s;ome Gentlemen of the Earl <HI>de la Rochefoucaults,</HI> fought at the Orolope of the main ma&s;t. The Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> accompanied alwaies with the Earl of <HI>Rochefoucault,</HI> went conti|nually vp and down to prouide for what was nece&s;&s;ary. The <HI>Seiur de la Verdier,</HI> lieu|tenant of the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e</HI> his company of hor&s;e, who was imployed to impart his wil on all &s;ides, was hurt in the head with a musket &s;hot: Some other Gentlemen and officers &s;lain; among&s;t others, the ma&s;ter of the &s;hip, who a&s;si&s;ted the Lord of <HI>Va&s;&s;ale</HI> and the Seriant Maior who did v&s;e won|derfull endeauours about quenching of the fire, already growne great, and almo&s;t pa&s;t all hope of &s;laking: in the end it was not|with&s;tanding put out by exceeding great diligence, in le&s;&s;e than an houre. Our hap|pine&s;&s;e was in this, that the enemie giuing
<PB N="13" REF="6">ouer the fight, abandoned our Admiral, and gaue vs lea&s;ure to intend nothing but the quenching of the fire; which we &s;hould ve|ry hardly haue done, if we had been forced to fight and quench it both at once.</P>
<P>The ioy was incredible which the re&s;t of our army had, which could helpe vs no lon|ger by rea&s;on of the winde and Tide which vvere both contrarie, when they &s;awe the Admyrall rout the Enemie hauing beene formerlie afrayde le&s;t hee had been vtterlie burnt among&s;t them; which &s;o encouraged the Kings fleet, as they endeuoured to reu|nite them &s;elues at the &s;ame in&s;tant crying on all &s;ides Victorie, Victorie, vntill three howers vvithin night; vvhen it vvaxed &s;o darke on a &s;uddaine that our &s;hips came came foule one of another: &s;o as the ene|mie making v&s;e of the occa&s;ion vvithdrew them&s;elues. And then our <HI>Admirall</HI> vvho beganne to bee agrovend, being but at 3. fathome vvater, in following the maine, vvas con&s;trained to &s;taie: then hee hung out his light and vvas alone a verie long while hauing aduanced him&s;elfe in the heate of the fight a league from the place vvhere he
<PB N="14" REF="7">vvas, at the fir&s;t on&s;ett.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ve&s;&s;els which came vp vnto him, after his long &s;taie for them vvere the <HI>&V;irgin,</HI> wherein was the <HI>Sieur de Manty Rereadmirall, The Knight of Cuges,</HI> who vvas &s;laine aboord the <HI>Vize-admirall</HI> of the Ea&s;t, and the <HI>Sieur de l'I&s;t,</HI> Lieutenant vnto <HI>Mon&s;. de Valenc&egrave;.</HI></P>
<P>The Gallion of <HI>Malta</HI> was a&s;&s;aulted by 3. Ve&s;&s;els, and re&s;cued by <HI>Cuges,</HI> who &s;unk <HI>Arnauldes</HI> &s;hip, vvhich vvas of 400. tunnes, wherein were a great many of Gentlemen and Voluntaries of <HI>Rochel,</HI> vvhich vvere ei|ther &s;laine or drovvned, except the Cap|taine and a Coun&s;ellor of <HI>Rochel,</HI> vvhich vvere taken pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>There are found ten of the Rochelers &s;hips &s;unk, more then 2000. men &s;lain, or drovvned, and of ours &s;ome 400.</P>
<P>The Rochelers Fleet fled tovvards 30. Flemi&s;h Ve&s;&s;els, vvhich had not aduanced them&s;elues to fight, to th'end their lo&s;&s;e might not be knovvne by day. They haue taken fro~ them all their men they can &s;pare to furni&s;h their &s;hips againe: If vve had had but one houre of day more, there had fevve of them e&s;caped.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="7">
<P> Their Army could not be recollected, but on the morrovv: Mon&s;ieur <HI>de S. Luc</HI> ralli|ed him&s;elfe al&s;o for his part at the &s;ame in|&s;tant vvith 30. Saile neere vnto Mon&s;. <HI>de Gui&s;e,</HI> and the Generall of the Gallies like|vvi&s;e; vvho aftervvards, during the calme, &s;unke the <HI>S. Lewis</HI> which vvas one of Mon&s;. <HI>de Neners</HI> his &s;hips, vvhich tho&s;e of <HI>Rochel</HI> had taken the la&s;t yeere.</P>
<P>The morrow after going to di&s;couer them, we &s;aw 20. of their &s;hips which were run on ground and battered vvith our Can|non. So that of 70. &s;hips vvhich the Roche|lers had on the day of battell, there appea|red no more but 32. vvhich vve hope to &s;poil vvith our Cannon, becau&s;e vve cannot come at them vvithout running on ground. They haue &s;hevved great boldnes, and haue indeed made valiant re&s;i&s;tance, like men de|&s;iring to dye or ouercome.</P>
<P>All the &s;quadrons of both the Armies were pell mell at it, the &s;pace of two houres during day-light: th'ob&s;curity of the night &s;aued tho&s;e which remain'd of the Roche|lers &s;ide; becau&s;e crying <HI>Holy Virgine,</HI> and <HI>God &s;aue the King,</HI> as we did, (vvhich was
<PB N="16" REF="8">the word of the Kings Fleete) and becau&s;e we could no longer di&s;cern our marks, our Ve&s;&s;els fell fowle one of another.</P>
<P>This is the truth of what pa&s;&s;ed in this Sea-fight, in which there vvas no Comman|der or Captaine, which &s;hewed not proofe inough of his valour; the fight was &s;o furi|ous, as we may truly &s;ay there was di&s;char|ged on th'one &s;ide and the other more then 15000. Cannon &s;hot. Nor is it to be for|gotten, that on the morrovv after, <HI>Mon&s;. de Gui&s;e</HI> hauing rallied his forces, &s;ent to &s;um|mon tho&s;e which commanded in the <HI>Diue,</HI> to render them&s;elues, which is a Fort made in an Iland very neere <HI>Aiguillon,</HI> which they had lately &s;urpri&s;ed, which place yeelded at his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>Finally, as <HI>Mon&s;. de Gui&s;e</HI> was about to pur&s;ue his victorie, and land his Armie into tho&s;e Ilands which the Rochellers held, he receiued letters from his Maie&s;ty, which a&s;|&s;ured him of the peace; Which hath whol|ly &s;tayed the cour&s;e of a greater expedition, which he held him&s;elfe almo&s;t a&s;&s;ured of: &s;uch confidence hee hath in Gods protecti|on, who is the true auenger of Kings quar|rels.</P>

Mon&s;ieur le Duc de Gui&s;e entr'autres, vray imitateur de la genero&s;it&eacute; de &s;es Peres, qui &s;ous les au&s;pices de nos Rois ont tou&s;|iours releu&eacute; l'honneur des Autels, auoit vne telle impati|ence de veoir que l'injure du temps &amp; la contrariete des vents le retardoit de faire quelque &s;ignalee expedition de guerre, qu'en &s;in il a pris la premiere occa&s;ion qui s'en e&s;t pre&s;entee, comme s'en&s;uit.</P>
<P>Il e&s;t done &agrave; &s;cauoir que le 24. Octobre l'arm&eacute;e Naualle de &s;a Maje&s;t&eacute; arriua en veue des terres, o&ugrave; elle fut con|trainte de mou&icirc;ller &agrave; l'entr&egrave;e du pertuis Breton aupres des Balenes, auquel lieu &s;e rendit Mon&s;ieur le Comte de la Rochefoucault auec 15. cens hommes de pied, &amp; deux
