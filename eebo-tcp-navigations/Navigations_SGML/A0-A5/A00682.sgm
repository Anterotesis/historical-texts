<HEAD>THE MANNER OF the Solemnities at the Election and Coronation of <HI>Fardinand</HI> the Em|perour, in <HI>Francford Augu&s;t</HI> 30. 1619. With other occurrences in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and diuers <HI>parts of Germany for three moneths la&s;t pa&s;t.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THE Earle of <HI>Thorne</HI> (after hee had renewed his coue|nant with the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> and di&s;patched his affaires in <HI>Mo|rauia,</HI> according to his harts de&s;ire) remoued his Campe from thence, and pa&s;&s;ed into the lower <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and inter|cepting &s;ome certaine places and townes by the way, laid &s;iege again&s;t <HI>Laba,</HI> which refu&s;ed to giue him admittance becau&s;e it was fortified with a ga|ri&s;on.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tant States, &s;eeing that they could not hitherto make any full agreement with the Romi&s;h Catholiques, and that they had &s;pent all the time
<PB N="2" REF="3">in vaine, &s;ent their emba&s;&s;adours vnto him, to de|mand of him what rea&s;on hee had to enter that country with &s;o great an army: and to reque&s;t him, that, &s;eeng they had done nothing which might offend the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> hee would lead away his Forces from thence againe. For the rea&s;on why hitherto they had returned no an&s;wer to the Let|ters which were &s;ent from the <HI>Bohemians</HI> the fifth of March, was, becau&s;e that the Romi&s;h Catho|lique States, day by day, deferred to giue their Ca|tegoricall and re&s;olute an&s;wer to the principall ar|ticles and clau&s;es of tho&s;e Letters; and yet not|with&s;tanding had alwayes made fayre &s;hew of a friendly agreement and peaceable end. Howeuer, albeit they &s;aw that their hope hereof was fru|&s;trate, yet they were not again&s;t the much-de&s;ired League, but were rather glad of it: and the rather, for that they called to minde, how that the Empe|rour <HI>Matthias</HI> an&s;wered the States at <HI>Budwitz</HI> in the yeare 1614. that they &s;hould &s;end their Legates or Emba&s;&s;adors to the Parliament which was to be holden at <HI>Prage</HI> in the yeare 1615. and then and there &s;hould enter a Treaty concerning the re|newing of that League. Wherefore they gaue li|cence and authoritie to their Deputies or Legates, to renew that League; prouided, that it were not repugnant to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and the States and Religion of the Romi&s;h Catholiques. This Emba&s;&s;ie by fiue &s;elected and cho&s;en out of euery State, was performed.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>A while after there came to the Camp, certaine Emba&s;&s;adours of the Romi&s;h catholike States, and Earle <HI>Buchem</HI> being their Spoke&s;man, they &s;ay that they neuer did any thing that might aggrieue ey|ther the Earle of <HI>Thorne,</HI> or any others of the <HI>Bo|hemians:</HI> and that they did very carefully maintaine and pre&s;erue peace. Wherefore they reque&s;t that he would be plea&s;ed to &s;pare them, and to di&s;lodge his Campe from before <HI>Laba.</HI></P>
<P>As touching the Confederation and League betwixt the Prote&s;tants and them; It was true in|deed, that the Prote&s;tant States and they had not yet drawne to a full conclu&s;ion in all things; yet, fora&s;much as the points of difference betwixt them were but &s;mall, they were in good hope that very &s;hortly a good end and agreement &s;hould be made betwixt them.</P>
<P><HI>Thorne</HI> making an&s;wer, &s;aid vnto them; That the <HI>Bohemians</HI> by maine nece&s;&s;ity were con&s;trained to doe what they did: and for his part, That he would not willingly vndertake any thing again&s;t any man without cau&s;e: but his de&s;ire was, to pur|&s;ue all ho&s;tile Forces, and to driue away the ene|my though hee were at <HI>Hieru&s;alem:</HI> That hee came into that Prouince to pre&s;erue peace and tranquili|tie, and to relieue and ayd the oppre&s;&s;ed; for hee would faine haue it &s;o, that hereafter the Prote|&s;tants and Romi&s;h Catholiques &s;hould walke toge|ther hand in hand as equals one to another in eue|ry re&s;pect. That heretofore the Romi&s;h Catho|liques
<PB N="4" REF="4">haue had the &s;uperiority and preheminence, but again&s;t good rea&s;on; for the Prote&s;tants were as hone&s;t men as the Romi&s;h Catholiques, and therefore hee would no longer &s;uffer that the&s;e be|ing kept vnder and oppre&s;&s;ed, the Romi&s;h Catho|liques (like oyle in water) &s;hould &s;wimme aloft: for he would haue an equalitie kept among&s;t them, without any re&s;pect had to one Religion or other; and looke what priuiledges were granted to the one &s;ide, the &s;ame &s;hould be permitted to the o|ther, that &s;o a con&s;tant and perpetuall peace be|twixt them might be made: And that who&s;oeuer &s;hould be their King and Prince, hee might be &s;afe from the treacheries and commotions of the <HI>Cle&s;e|lians,</HI> &amp; &s;o might gouerne the weale publique with greater quietne&s;&s;e and honour. For his owne part, hee tooke no care whence or from whom he &s;hould receiue proui&s;ion, mony or aid to maintaine his ar|my. He had re&s;igned him&s;elfe vp to God, and made prayers to him, that he would further and pro&s;per this his hone&s;t and truly Chri&s;tian purpo&s;e, and grant vnto him power and &s;trength fitting and ne|ce&s;&s;ary for him. That he tels them the truth, That he would neuer haue made any attempt again&s;t <HI>La|ba,</HI> but that he found it fortified with a Gari&s;on, and that they them&s;elues were the cau&s;es why hee did be&s;iege it. For hee had giuen notice to Earle <HI>Trau&s;tam,</HI> that when hee found no Gari&s;on, nor any re&s;i&s;tance, there the people &s;hould not need to feare any danger by his comming.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>When the Legates had heard him &s;peake thus, they made an&s;wer, that they would deale with <HI>Fer|dinand,</HI> &amp; do their be&s;t endeauours, that both <HI>Laba</HI> and other places in that Prouince might bee quit and cleared of Souldiers.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>Thorne</HI> gaue his word that on condi|tion, that Gari&s;on might be remoued, the gates of the Citie &s;et open, and hereafter the Citie fenced with a Gari&s;on of Prote&s;tants, and not with ene|mies, hee would not attempt any thing further again&s;t that place: and &s;o he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>In the mean while the Lords directors held a con|&s;ultation, that if a treaty of peace were to be made, vpon what condition it were to be entertained: and they concluded &amp; decreed it altogether nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="1">1 That all Prote&s;tants what&s;oeuer (as well States as inferiours) throughout the whole Kingdome, whether they dwelt vnder a Romi&s;h catholike or an Euangelicall Magi&s;trate, by vertue of a charter granted vnto them by the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus,</HI> in point of Religion; (it being mutually couenanted on both &s;ides) &s;hould enioy the benefite of the &s;e|crete&s;t con&s;ultations in the Parliament, and Imperi|all confirmations, and it &s;hould be lawfull for them as well as for the <HI>Sile&s;ians</HI> &amp; others in other places to erect and &s;et vp Schooles; all &s;uch acts, decrees, proui&s;o's, made heretofore to the contrary, either by <HI>Ferdinand</HI> or by them that are <HI>Sub vn&acirc;,</HI> being declared to be voyd and of none effect.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P N="2">2 That the Pro&s;cription and the bani&s;hing of the Ie&s;uits out of the Kingdome, &s;hould be ratified and made &s;ure and firme for euer: &s;o that it &s;hall neuer be lawfull for them to returne into that king|dome vnder pretence of any order what&s;oeuer. That their Colledges and all their goods &s;hould be confi&s;cate and adiudged to the publique good of the States, and that their priuiledges &s;hould be razed out of publique Records.</P>
<P N="3">3 That their Confederations and Leagues made with the people of <HI>Hungaria, Au&s;tria, Mo|rauia,</HI> and of both the <HI>Lu&s;atia's</HI> &s;hould bee ratified and confirmed.</P>
<P N="4">4 That the Matter of Defence &s;hould be defer|red till the generall A&s;&s;embly of tho&s;e Prouinces.</P>
<P N="5">5 That it &s;hould be lawfull to ordaine and ap|poynt A&s;&s;emblies of States in diuers Territories, after the ancient manner.</P>
<P N="6">6 That the hereditary Leagues with the Ele|ctors and other neighbour Princes, &s;hould bee re|newed.</P>
<P N="7">7 That the Bani&s;hing and pro&s;cription of cer|taine men out of the Kingdome, the remouing of them from the publique Offices, &s;hould bee con|&s;tant and firme.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>To the&s;e &s;euen articles, the Directors after|wards added diuers others which they thought needfull for the Kingdome and the prouinces: as namely,</P>
<P N="1">1 That, that decree where the decea&s;ed Empe|rour did giue to the bi&s;hop of <HI>Prage Ius patronatus,</HI> the aduow&s;on and patronage, to pre&s;ent Prie&s;ts to all Churches, is repugnant to his Maie&s;ties Char|ter; and therefore let it be abrogated, and let the power be giuen to the con&s;i&s;tory of <HI>Prage</HI> to confer tho&s;e benefices vpon &s;uch Pa&s;tors as are addicted to that religion, which is principally profe&s;&s;ed in that Pari&s;h.</P>
<P N="2">2 Seeing that the Subiects dwelling not only in the Emperours dominions, but al&s;o in other &s;piri|tuall or &s;ecular iuri&s;dictions, (both parties being agreed) by the Emperours charter, had had pow|er and authority hitherto to erect Churches and Schooles, let them &s;till retaine and keepe the &s;ame hereafter, and let the&s;t <HI>Clo&s;tergrabiens,</HI> who&s;e tem|ple was demoli&s;hed by the Bi&s;hop, make v&s;e of &s;ome other temple in the City, vntill their owne be reedified.</P>
<P N="3">3 Let the <HI>Burnauiens</HI> hereafter quietly and pea|cibly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e their owne Church.</P>
<P N="4">4 The Churches in the City of <HI>Prage</HI> (which
<PB N="8" REF="6">haue beene built &s;ince his Maie&s;ties Charter was obtained) as namely the Church of the holy Trini|ty, in the le&s;&s;er towne; and the Churches of our Sauiour, and of <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Iude,</HI> with the Chappell adioining to it, in the old towne, let them for euer be left in the power of them which are <HI>Sub vtr&acirc;&abque;,</HI> and by whom they were built: and the next Parlia|ment let them be regi&s;tred in the publike recordes.</P>
<P N="5">5 Fora&s;much as the vniuer&s;ity of <HI>Prage</HI> and all the goods appertaining vnto it, were giuen by the Emperour <HI>Rodolphus</HI> to the States <HI>Sub vtr&acirc;&abque;.</HI> Therfore let them &s;till haue power either to be&s;tow &s;ome thing of their owne, or to exact of their Sub|iects any thing whereby that vniuer&s;ity and other Churches may be &s;u&s;tained, and that which is &s;o collected, let it be kept vpon record, and required of the defenders as well as other publike contribu|tions of the Subiects.</P>
<P N="6">6 Let not any other &s;pirituall orders be&s;ides tho&s;e which are in the kingdome already, be brought in either by the King, or by tho&s;e which are <HI>Sub vn&acirc;.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7 Let not the Commi&s;&s;aries which are wont to be &s;ent to the Parliament by the King: let them not dwell too long vpon the Kings propo&s;ition, but &s;peedily require an an&s;wer from the States.</P>
<P N="8">8 Let the States in the Parliament conferre their
<PB N="9" REF="6">voyces together; and after they haue collected their voyces, let them giue vp their an&s;wers by one either &s;euerally or generally: neither let the Kings Councellers &s;under and &s;eparate them&s;elues from the States, but let them al&s;o giue their be&s;t coun|&s;ell and aduice for the common good.</P>
<P N="9">9 Let it not be lawfull to except again&s;t the an|&s;wer of the States in Parliaments: neither let the States be bound to admit any reply, or to accept any other conclu&s;ion, if perhaps after their depar|ture any &s;uch conclu&s;ion be made of any.</P>
<P N="10">10 And let not the Parliament be continued a|boue 14. dayes, vnle&s;&s;e it be by a peculiar con&s;ent of the States.</P>
<P N="11">11 When the chiefe Chancelor of the King|domes propoundeth any thing to the King, let an|other Chancelor be pre&s;ent, and haue notice giuen him of the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="12">12 Such as are to be Secretaries and Clarkes of the Chancery, let them be hone&s;t men, and addic|ted to the Religion <HI>Sub vtr&acirc;&abque;,</HI> after the v&s;uall and accu&s;tomed manner in former times.</P>
<P N="13">13 In the next Parliament, let there be a con&s;ul|tation held, about renewing the Hereditary leagues with the Electors and other neighbour countries.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7">
<P N="14">14 That which hath been already concluded, in the la&s;t a&s;&s;embly, concerning &s;ome perfidious per|&s;ons, whereof &s;ome were to be bani&s;hed the coun|try, and &s;ome to be barred from publike offices: let it remaine firme and ratified.</P>
<P N="15">15 Hereafter let none of the Kings Lieutenants in the townes of <HI>Prage</HI> be &s;u&s;teyned or maintained, neither let the Kings Iudges haue place either in the townes of <HI>Prage,</HI> or in any others.</P>
<P N="16">16 And &s;eeing that by commandement of the States, the Directors and exactors of contributi|ons haue runne into a great deale of debt, in defend|ing and pre&s;eruing the Kingdome from the enemy, and in paying the Souldiers their &s;tipends (the Directors in the meane while being wi&s;e enough to &s;aue them&s;elues harmle&s;&s;e) Therefore let the goods of &s;uch as were cau&s;es of that war (whether they be fled out of the Kingdome, or &s;till remaine in it) be confi&s;cated, and adiudged to the paiment of tho&s;e debts.</P>
<P N="17">17 In like manner, let the Kings goods be &s;old (alwayes excepting tho&s;e goods of the King which are in&s;erted into publique records, and can neuer be alienated) Let the Kings goods be &s;ould &s;eeing they were redeemed with other mens mony, and that many therefore were con&s;trained to en|gage their faith and credit: and let the mony which
<PB N="11" REF="7">is collected thence be imployed to the payment of the Kings debts, and towards the repayring of their dammages and lo&s;&s;es, who&s;e Hou&s;es and goods were pillag'd and burnt vp by the Kings Souldiers.</P>
<P N="18">18 Such Church goods as vpon the vrgency of extreame nece&s;&s;ity, haue beene laid to pawne or &s;old outright, let them not be redeemed at all; but let more of them be &s;old away, yet with this cauti|on, that proui&s;ion be made that the &s;pirituall per|&s;ons may be hone&s;tly maintained.</P>
<P N="19">19 Let not the chamber of <HI>Bohemia</HI> be &s;ubiect to the Kings chamber, nor doe &s;eruice to it in further|ing the decrees thereof.</P>
<P N="20">20 Let the walles be reedified about the townes of <HI>Prage,</HI> and let all forraigne Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall lawes be &s;ubiect to their iuri&s;diction.</P>
<P N="21">21 The <HI>Prage</HI> townes and other townes which haue a third free &s;tate, let them not hereafter be called any more by the royall name of Chamber goods, as heretofore in publique records, (wee know no rea&s;on why) they were &s;tiled and enti|tuled.</P>
<P N="22">22 What &s;hall be done concerning tho&s;e two Cities in the Kingdome of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> namely <HI>Pil&s;na</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="8">and <HI>Budwitz,</HI> let it be con&s;ulted vpon.</P>
<P N="23">23 Touching money which &s;hall accrew by bu|rials, let the halfe of it be imployed vpon the re|pairing the wals of the City, and vpon the <HI>Prage</HI> Townes.</P>
<P><HI>Pil&s;na, Budwitz,</HI> and <HI>Gret&s;na,</HI> let them be giuen to the State <HI>ab vtra&abque;,</HI> that in them they may pro|uide &s;ufficient Armories, without which our bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e of Defence cannot come to any good.</P>
<P N="24">24 But to who&s;e tru&s;t the&s;e Armories are to be committed, and what co&s;ts and charges are need|full for prouiding and &s;toring vp armes therein, let con&s;ultation be had hereafter.</P>
<P>At this time there was a Parliament holden at <HI>Vrati&s;lavia</HI> by the Princes and the States of <HI>Si|le&s;ia:</HI> The King &s;ent to it one <HI>Otto Melander</HI> a noble Heroicall Gentleman, and one of his Councell: who from the Prince of <HI>Lignitz,</HI> in the name of the re&s;t of the Princes and States, brought backe this an&s;were, <HI>viz:</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ay, that by relation of the Noble and Honourable Par&s;onage <HI>Otto Melander,</HI> and al|&s;o by his Maie&s;ties Royall Letters, which hee deliuered vnto them, they were giuen to vnder|&s;tand, that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> hath determined, &s;ince the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> is now decea&s;ed, to vnder|take the gouernment of the Kingdome, and to
<PB N="13" REF="8">confirme vnto the&s;e Princes and Countries, all lawes, rights, and priuiledges, as well gene|rall as &s;peciall, all Grants and Cu&s;tomes, euen the <HI>Maie&s;tatis Diploma,</HI> the Charters of State, which were granted by his Predece&s;&s;ours, the Kings of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> by <HI>Ferdinand, Maximilian, Rodolphus</HI> and <HI>Matthias:</HI> and that hee is deter|mined not onely to confirme what&s;oeuer hath beene granted by his Predece&s;&s;ors, but al&s;o to &s;end his Confirmation vnto them: or if at this time it be full of danger to &s;end &s;uch Confirma|tions, yet at lea&s;t hee will accept what&s;oeuer &s;pe|ciall priuiledges any of the Prouinces can &s;hew for them&s;elues. That looke what di&s;&s;entions and di&s;agreements there be betwixt the Romi&s;h Ca|tholiques and Prote&s;tants, he is purpo&s;ed to com|pound them.</P>
<P>That hee would in the&s;e places confirme the Office of the King, and accept from him the Oath of Allegiance: and did hope that by this meanes it would come to pa&s;&s;e, that (&s;eeing hee promi&s;ed moreouer to take vpon him, and to di&s;|charge the Emperours debts which hee owed in the Prouinces of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI>) the States of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> would not onely pay &s;uch Contributions as they had formerly promi&s;ed, but al&s;o would performe all other duties and offices which were due vnto him: That in &s;o doing hee him&s;elfe al&s;o might haue cau&s;e to declare and &s;hew his fatherly loue and affection vnto them &s;till more and more:
<PB N="14" REF="9">And that al&s;o, the States of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> to whom in like manner he had already &s;ent the Confirma|tion of their Priuiledges, might thereby take occa&s;ion to &s;ettle them&s;elues to due obedience, that &s;o all troubles being compo&s;ed, and warres ended, the Kingdome might enioy her former peace and tranquilitie.</P>
<P>But as heretofore it gaue them great content|ment, that the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> was plea&s;ed to deui&s;e a way how his Kingdomes and Countries might be prouided of one to be their head, and to &s;ucceed him after his death; and that &s;o all occa|&s;ions of warres and &s;editions being cut off, peace and tranquility might be pre&s;erued and continued in the Kingdome: So al&s;o they called to minde, when that Succe&s;&s;ion was giuen to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> vp|on what conditions they accepted it, and what promi&s;es they receiued from him; and what they on the other &s;ide were bound to performe vnto him: and &s;o they wi&s;h with all their hearts, that <HI>Matthias</HI> his departure had hapned at &s;uch time, as all things being in peace, they might quietly v&s;e and enioy their piuiledges and immunities, and <HI>Ferdinand</HI> might obtaine the wi&s;hed end of his Succe&s;&s;ion with greate&s;t facilitie: for &s;o nothing could haue hindered them, but that vpon the re|ceipt of the Letters of Confirmation of their ge|nerall and &s;peciall priuiledges, they had forthwith accepted him for their King, and had performed vnto him all &s;uch offices as were due.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<P>But how&s;oeuer it be, they are exceeding glad, that he remembring his promi&s;e made vnto them, is de&s;irous to put it in execution. But they doubt not, but that <HI>Ferdinand</HI> will &s;et before his eyes, how lamentable and confu&s;ed the &s;tate of tho&s;e Countries is; and that the combu&s;tion is now &s;pread &s;o farre, and growne &s;o vehement, that it cannot without great difficultie and danger be ex|tingui&s;hed and &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: and that hee will be plea&s;ed to take into his con&s;ideration, how farre the&s;e times are altered from tho&s;e wherein his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the Kingdome of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was made:</P>
<P>As namely, that now the publique peace and quiet is di&s;turbed, all the Country embroyled with warres, their Townes &s;acked and &s;poyled, and euery place fraught with Soldiers and armed men. That their priuiledges confirmed heretofore, are of no power or &s;trength to defend them from the&s;e euils. And that not onely Di&s;putations and diuers wre&s;ted interpretations haue beene inuented to di&s;credit that profitable bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of Defence, vn|dertaken for the profit and good of all; but al&s;o, that warres are prepared, and great violence done to the Subiect: &s;o that it &s;eemeth that the bare con|firmation of Priuiledges is not now any longer &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h peace in that Kingdome and tho&s;e Provinces, but it is nece&s;&s;ary that what be|fore was promi&s;ed in words, be now &s;hewed in deed and action.</P>
<P>Al&s;o they doubt not, but that he will be plea&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="10">to remember what a quiet, &s;weet and calme &s;tate there was thorow the whole kingdome of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and the other confederate countries, not onely in the dayes of former Kings, his Predece&s;&s;ors; but euen at that very time when he was admitted to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the &s;ame kingdome: and how farre it is e&s;tranged from that tranquility: how much it concerneth the common wealth, that the ancient and whole&s;ome ordinances of the kingdome, and the old cu&s;tome be ob&s;erued, not onely about the de&s;ignation, but al&s;o about the acceptation of the King, who&s;oeuer he &s;hall bee.</P>

<P>Al&s;o that the King by the premi&s;es may ea&s;ily coniecture, that the&s;e embroilements and combu&s;|tions, together with the troubles and hurts which followed thereupon in point of religion through|out <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Sile&s;ia,</HI> cannot be remedied and laid a&s;leepe, by the bare charter of confirmation of

To the performance hereof, he needed not any inter|po&s;ition; for here was nothing required but the very effect of their priuiledges; and that is the one|ly meanes both to &s;ettle peace and tranquility on all &s;ides, and al&s;o to keepe and retaine it con&s;tantly: which being v&s;ed, when he &s;hould enter vpon the admini&s;tration of the kingdome, he needed not to make any que&s;tion at all, but they in their place will doe what nece&s;&s;ity requireth.</P>

In burialls and &s;pittles for &s;icke folke there &s;hould be no difference made between Prote&s;tants &amp; R.

<PB N="35" REF="19">together with their Suffraganes and &s;ome others of the Clergy, aduanced forward to meete <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> from the Quire euen to the doore of the Temple, &amp; hauing receiued him ho|norably, they lead him to an Altar &s;ituate at the entrance of the Quire or Chancell: There he en|tered into a &s;eate appointed for prayer, placed be|fore the Altar, made of cloth of &s;iluer, and a Ca|nopy of the &s;ame co&s;tly &s;tuffe let downe from the roofe of the Church ouer the &s;eate: the two Arch|bi&s;hops al&s;o went into their &s;euerall &s;eates, on the right hand <HI>Triers,</HI> on the left <HI>Colein,</HI> prepared for them &amp; richly hung with red Scarlet cloth: <HI>Ferdi|nand</HI> tooke vp a little booke which was layd in that &s;eate, and compo&s;ed him&s;elfe to prayer, the Secular Amba&s;&s;adors &s;eated al&s;o neere him: The <HI>Chantors</HI> meane while &s;ang that &s;ong: <HI>Glory be to God on high:</HI> the Elector of <HI>Mentz</HI> began Ma&s;&s;e, and in the &s;aying of it the other Electors and Am|ba&s;&s;adors lead away <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to the high Altar, and from thence (after Benediction) vnto a royall Throne, which was placed a &s;tep or two aboue the &s;eate where <HI>Ferdinand</HI> prayed; continuing their ob&s;eruancy and ceremonies, he came to the Altar againe, and there fell vpon his knees, the Electors and the Amba&s;&s;adors kneeling by him till the Le|tany was &s;aid ouer him. This done, Hee that was to Con&s;ecrate him, propounded to him the v&s;uall Que&s;tions. <HI>Whether He would &s;tedfa&s;tly keepe the Chri&s;tian and Catholique Religion, defend the
<PB N="36" REF="20">Church, admini&s;ter iu&s;tice to all, encrea&s;e, and en|large the Empire, maintaine the widdows and father|le&s;&s;e children, render due honour to the Bi&s;hop of Rome: Ferdinand</HI> an&s;wered affirmatiuely to euery of the&s;e, and confirmed his affirmation with a &s;o|lemne oath. The Con&s;ecrator turned him&s;elfe to the Electors, Amba&s;&s;adors, and all the people &s;tanding round about, demaunded of them, whe|ther they would &s;ubmit them&s;elues to <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h his kingdome, and performe odedience to his commandements: when they had te&s;tified their con&s;ents to all tho&s;e motions, and cryed with a loud voice, <HI>That he ought to be their King;</HI> hee was vnclothed in certaine places of his body, and then the Con&s;ecrator came to him, and taking oyle annointed the Crowne of his head, his neck, his brea&s;ts, his right arme and his hands, adding the&s;e words at each &s;euerall part hee annointed; <HI>I annoint thee with holy oyle, in the name of the Fa|ther, the Sonne, and the holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The vnction fini&s;hed, the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall Ele|ctors, with their Suffraganes leade <HI>Ferdinand</HI> through the Quire into the Conclaue or Colledge of Election, and hauing wiped off the oyle, they put vpon him the ancient Emperiall and Ponti|ficall Robes brought from <HI>Norimbergh;</HI> that is, the Bootes and long Surpli&s;&s;e, and Gowne let downe from his necke by his Bre&s;t in parts and &s;o throwne ouer his &s;houlders, they put al&s;o Gloues vpon his hands, and thus attired as it were a Deacon, they
<PB N="37" REF="20">bring him forth againe from the Chancell to the &s;eate where he fir&s;t prayed, and there the Con&s;e|crator liberally be&s;towed vpon him a new ble&s;&s;ing; prayers &s;aid, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> a&s;cends into the Imperiall Throne, and the Electors of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Colein</HI> take downe the &s;word of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great from the Altar, where together with the Crowne and Scep|ter it was layd; draw it forth, and giue it into <HI>Fer|dinands</HI> hands, the Con&s;ecrator &s;peaking the&s;e words: <HI>Take this &s;word by the hands of Bi&s;hops.</HI> And when he comes to the&s;e words: <HI>Be thou girt with this &s;word, &amp;c.</HI> Then the &s;word is put vp into the &s;heath againe, and girt vnto his &s;ide by the Am|ba&s;&s;ador of the Emperiall Electors.</P>
<P>Moreouer, after this the Con&s;ecrator takes the Ring from the Altar, and pronouncing certaine words put it vpon his finger: from the &s;ame Altar he takes the Scepter and Globe of the Empire, and giues them into his hand; the Scep|ter into his right hand, the Globe into his left, with the&s;e words: <HI>Take the rod of Vertue &amp; Equity;</HI> la&s;t of all, the Emperiall Crowne is lifted off the Altar and &s;et vpon his head by the three Spirituall Electors ioyntly, with the&s;e words: <HI>take the crowne of the Kingdome,</HI> and then they array him with the golden cloke of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; the&s;e Ceremo|nies ob&s;erued, he comes down from his Throne, &amp; deliuers back the&s;e things to the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Temporall Electors, that is to &s;ay, the Globe to the <HI>Palatines</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, and the Scepter to
<PB N="38" REF="21"><HI>Brandenburghs,</HI> and &s;o of the re&s;t; then againe hee makes towards the Altar, and there takes a &s;olemne oath, that hee will doe all tho&s;e things which be|long to a good Emperor.</P>
<P>The oath taken, the Ma&s;&s;e goes on, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> betaking him to his throne the while, and here is exqui&s;it mu&s;icke playd by the Quire: From the Throne he is once more led to the Altar, the Sa|crifice of the Ma&s;&s;e fir&s;t offered, Hee receiues the Sacrament at the hands of the Con&s;ecrators; the Sacrament, prayers and other &s;eruice fully fini|&s;hed, the Con&s;ecrator <HI>Mentz</HI> goes out fir&s;t, <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Colein</HI> after him; and betweene them goes <HI>Ferdinand</HI> to a &s;tately Theater, a &s;tage ray&s;ed vp aloft towards the South, hung on all &s;ides with rich Tapi&s;try and Stamell cloth; being layd ouer the floore therof: before him are caried the Armes of the Empire by the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Secular Electors; the Suffraganes and others of the Cler|gy following after: there the Spirituall Electors place him in a Princely Throne, eleuated &s;ome|what aboue the re&s;t of the &s;tage, couered ouer with cloth of gold, and hung with a Canopy of red Veluet, the Chanters at the time &s;inging the &s;ong of Saint <HI>Ambro&s;e:</HI> The Mu&s;icke cea&s;ing, the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz</HI> drawes neere to <HI>Ferdi|nand,</HI> and in his owne name, and in the name of the other Electors, congratulates to him this hap|py Inauguration, and withall, excellently and care|fully commends to him the whole Empire.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="21">
<P>Pre&s;ently vpon this the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Triers</HI> and <HI>Colein,</HI> and all the Clergy leaue the &s;tage and returne into the Chancell, where putting off their <HI>Pontificalibus,</HI> they put vpon them againe the robes of the Electors: <HI>Ferdinand</HI> &s;taies &s;till in his Chaire of &s;tate, and creates Knights, by &s;triking them with the &s;word of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great. After this Hee ri&s;es vp, and goes him&s;elfe out of the The|ater, and returnes from Church in this &s;olemne order.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t and formo&s;t goe the &s;eruants of the Court, next the Coun&s;ellors of the Emperor, and the Princes Electors, as al&s;o a very great number of noble per&s;onages, then followed the Earles and Barons: in the next ranke the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Triers</HI> by him&s;elfe, the <HI>Palatines</HI> delegate and <HI>Brandenburghs</HI> together, carying the Globe, and the Scepter, then the Delegate of <HI>Saxony</HI> alone carying the Sword, next the Emperor with the Crowne on his head, and the Emperiall robes on his backe, by him&s;elfe likewi&s;e vnder a Canopy borne by the States of <HI>Francford,</HI> as was &s;hewed before: The Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Mentz</HI> and <HI>Colein</HI> to|gether, all going backe on foote clo&s;ed vp this royall Traine.</P>
<P>Thus goe they along forwards &s;traight to the Court ouer the bridge couered ouer with Stamell: there followed a little after three of <HI>Ferdinands</HI> Chaplaines on hor&s;e-back which ca&s;t abrode mo|ney to the people, gold and &s;iluer, of le&s;&s;e and
<PB N="40" REF="22">greater valew of round and &s;quare fa&s;hion: the greater money on one &s;ide had an arme &s;tretched forth of the Cloud, holding in the hand a Kingly Crowne with this in&s;cription, TO THOSE THAT STRIVE LAWFVLLY: on the other &s;ide this, FERDINAND II. KING OF HVNGARY AND BOHEMIA, CROWNED KING OF THE RO|MANS SEPTEMBER IX. MDCXIX. The le&s;&s;er moneys had the letter F. with a crowne, and the number of 11. &s;tamped on them on the one &s;ide; on the other a Crowne, and the&s;e words: CROWNED KING OF THE ROMANS, SEP|TEMBER IX. MDCXIX.</P>
<P>The ca&s;ting of this money made &s;uch a hurly burly among the Common-people, that the Chap|laines could &s;carce make way for the greatne&s;&s;e of the pre&s;&s;e, though they were on hor&s;ebacke: the cloth on the bridge as &s;oone as the Emperor pa&s;&s;ed, was cut, torne and rent in peeces by the people.</P>
<P>In the Pallace or Hall of the Court, the Tables were &s;et and royally furni&s;hed for him&s;elfe and the Princes Electors: the Tables of the three Tem|porall Electors were couered with red Veluet as al&s;o the Table of the Elector of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> but no meate was &s;et vpon them, as is prouided by the con&s;titution of the golden Bull: being thus at la&s;t in the Pallace, the Delegates of the Secular Ele|ctors addre&s;&s;ed them to performe the Offices of the Elector&s;hip, in &s;tead of their Lords and Princes
<PB N="41" REF="22">them&s;elues. When <HI>Pappenhemius</HI> the heredi|tary Mar&s;hall of the Empire mounted his hor&s;e, and being brought with a mea&s;ure of &s;iluer, to a heape of oates, being laid together in the open yard, before the Court, betweene the Well of wine and the Kitchin, filled his mea&s;ure, and &s;trucke it with a rod of &s;iluer, and then gaue it to a Seruant to keepe, the people after &s;natching them away.</P>
<P>After him appeared one of the Delegates of the <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> riding al&s;o on hor&s;e-backe from the Court, and tooke vp a Ba&s;en of &s;iluer with an Ewer of gold, and a Towell, &s;et vpon a Board by the Kitchin where the Bull was roa|&s;ted, and carryed it with him to the Court.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, the Delegate of the Elector <HI>Pala|tine,</HI> Sewer hereditary to the Kingdome, being brought foorth from the Court, tooke certaine di&s;hes of the Bull roa&s;ted in the publique Kit|chin, couered with foure &s;iluer platters, and &s;et out on the Dre&s;&s;er, and bore them with him to the Court.</P>
<P>This being done, the rude multitude breaking into the Kitchin, by maine force carryed away with them the Bull which was roa&s;ted whole, with the head, feet, hoofes, tayle and hornes, and &s;tuft full of Hares, Conies, Lambes, Gee&s;e, and diuers other &s;orts of Birds and fowles, pulling it by peece-meale, and cutting it a &s;under with
<PB N="42" REF="23">their kniues: and which is more rude, they defa|ced the Kitchin, and tooke away all the Tim|ber of it.</P>
<P>While they kept this coyle, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and the Electors are euery one at their owne Tables. The Well before the Court, made in the manner of a rocke, beganne to flow with redde and white wine, out of the mouth of an Eagle with two heads crowned, which was placed betweene two Lyons bearing the Ornaments of the Empire, the Scepter, the Globe and Sword.</P>
<P>Now the wine ranne out of this Eagle in great abundance for three houres together, being re|ceiued into two ve&s;&s;els of exceeding great quan|titie, as many as would hauing liberty to draw and drinke of it as much as they would, till at la&s;t, by the rage of the giddy multitude, they in vaine &s;triuing again&s;t them who were appoin|ted to keepe it, the Well was borne downe, and the Eagle, with the Lions, and all other Orna|ments of it were caryed away.</P>
<P>The Royall Dinner continued till fiue of the clocke in the after-noone with great &s;olemnitie and ioy. The Emperour at la&s;t departed from that Court to his owne Royall Palace, the Ele|ctors accompanying him &s;ome few dayes after. There were publique Tiltings for ioy of this Co|ronation.</P>
<P>After it the Amba&s;&s;adours of the <HI>Palatine</HI> and
<PB N="43" REF="23"><HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and la&s;t of all, of the Duke of <HI>Saxony,</HI> returned home to their &s;euerall Princes, many wi&s;hing all pro&s;peritie and good &s;ucce&s;&s;e to the Emperour, and expre&s;&s;ing their prayers for him in Ver&s;e.</P>
